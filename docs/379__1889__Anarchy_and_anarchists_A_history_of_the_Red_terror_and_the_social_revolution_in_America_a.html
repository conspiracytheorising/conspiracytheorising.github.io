<p>PREFACE.
</p>
<p>IT has seemed to me that there should be a history of the development,
</p>
<p>the revolt, and the tragedy of Anarchy in Chicago. This history I
</p>
<p>have written as impartially and as fairly as I knew how to write it. I
</p>
<p>have kept steadily before my eyes the motto,
</p>
<p>" Nothing extenuate, nor set down aught in malice."
</p>
<p>It will be found in the succeeding pages that neither animosity against
</p>
<p>the revolutionists, nor partiality to the State, has influenced the work. I
</p>
<p>have dealt with this episode in Chicago's history as calmly and as fairly as
</p>
<p>I am able. I have tried to put myself in the position of the misguided
</p>
<p>men whose conspiracy led to the Haymarket explosion and to the gallows;
</p>
<p>to understand their motives; to appreciate their ideals for so only could
</p>
<p>this volume be properly written.
</p>
<p>And to present a broader view, I have added a history of all forms of
</p>
<p>Socialism, Communism, Nihilism and Anarchy. In this, though necessarily
</p>
<p>brief, it has been the purpose to give all the important facts, and to set
</p>
<p>forth the theories of all those who, whether moderate or radical, whether
</p>
<p>sincerely laboring in the interests of humanity or boisterously striving for
</p>
<p>notoriety, have endeavored or pretended to improve upon the existing order
</p>
<p>of society.
</p>
<p>After the dynamite bomb exploded, carrying death into the ranks of men
</p>
<p>with whom I had been for years closely associated after an impudent attack
</p>
<p>had been made upon our law and upon our system, which I was sworn to
</p>
<p>defend it came to me as a duty to the State, a duty to my dead and
</p>
<p>wounded comrades, to bring the guilty men to justice ; to expose the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy to the world, and thus to assist in vindicating the law. How the
</p>
<p>duty was performed, this story tells.
</p>
<p>It is a plain narrative whose interest lies in the momentous character of
</p>
<p>the facts which it relates. Much of it is now for the first time given to the
</p>
<p>public. I have drawn upon the records of the case, made in court, but
</p>
<p>more especially upon the reports made to me, during the progress of the
</p>
<p>investigation, by the many detectives who were working under my direc-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>I can say for my book no more than this : that from the first page to the
</p>
<p>last there is no material statement which is not to my knowledge true. The

</p>
<p>reader, then, may at least depend upon the accuracy of the information
</p>
<p>presented here, even if I cannot make any other claim.
</p>
<p>It would be unfair and ungrateful if I did not seize this opportunity to
</p>
<p>vi PREFACE.
</p>
<p>put on lasting record my obligations to Judge Julius S. Grinnell, who was
</p>
<p>State's Attorney during the investigation. His support, steady and full of
</p>
<p>tact, enabled me to go through with the work, in spite of obstacles deliber-
</p>
<p>ately put in my way. My position was a delicate and difficult one : had it not
</p>
<p>been for him, and for others, success would have been almost impossible.
</p>
<p>Nor can I forego this occasion to bear testimony to the magnificent
</p>
<p>police work done in the case by Inspector Bonfield and his brother, James
</p>
<p>Bonfield, and by the officers who acted directly with me. These were
</p>
<p>Lieut. Charles A. Larsen and Officers Herman Schuettler, Michael Whalen,
</p>
<p>Jacob Loewenstein, Michael Hoffman, Charles Rehm, John Stift and B. P.
</p>
<p>Baer. Mr. Edmund Furthmann, at that time Assistant State's Attorney, as
</p>
<p>I have elsewhere recorded, worked upon the inquiry into the conspiracy
</p>
<p>with an acumen, a perseverance and an industry which were beyond all
</p>
<p>praise. I knew, when he was first associated with me in the case, that the
</p>
<p>outcome must be a victory for outraged law, and the result vindicated the
</p>
<p>prediction. To Mr. Thomas O. Thompson and to Mr. John T. McEnnis
</p>
<p>much of the literary form of this volume is to be credited, and to them also
</p>
<p>I am under lasting obligations. MICHAEL J. SCHAACK.

</p>
<p>THE conspiracy which culminated in the blaze of dynamite and the
</p>
<p>groans of murdered policemen on that fatal night of May 4th, 1886,
</p>
<p>had its origin far away from Chicago, and under a social system very dif-
</p>
<p>ferent from ours.
</p>
<p>In order that the reader may understand the tragedy, it will be necessary
</p>
<p>for me to go back to the commencement of the agitation, and to show how
</p>
<p>Anarchy in this city is the direct development of the social revolt in Europe.
</p>
<p>After "the red fool fury of the French" had burnt itself out, the nations of
</p>
<p>the Old Word, exhausted by the Titanic struggle with Napoleon, lay quiet
</p>
<p>'V
</p>
<p>for nearly a quarter of a century. The doctrines which had brought on the
</p>
<p>Reign of Terror had not died. After a period of quiet, the evangel of the
</p>
<p>Social Revolution again began. There was uneasiness throughout Europe.
</p>
<p>In France the Bourbons were driven out, although the cause of the people
</p>
<p>was betrayed by Louis Napoleon. In Germany the demand for a constitu-
</p>
<p>tion was pushed so strongly that even the sturdy Hohenzollerns had to
</p>
<p>give way before it. In Hungary there was a popular ferment. Poland was
</p>
<p>ready for a new rising against Russia. In Russia the movement which
</p>
<p>subsequently came to be known as Nihilism was born. In Italy Garibaldi
</p>
<p>and Mazzini were laying the foundations for the throne which the house of
</p>
<p>Savoy built upon the work of the secret societies.

</p>
<p>Nor must the reader believe that all this turmoil had not beneath it real
</p>
<p>grievances and honest causes. The peasantry and the laboring classes of
</p>
<p>Europe had been oppressed and plundered for centuries. The common
</p>
<p>people were just beginning to learn their power, and, while the excesses
</p>
<p>into which they were led were deplorable, it is not difficult to understand
</p>
<p>the causes which made the crisis inevitable.
</p>

</p>
<p>i8
</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>There is nothing ever lost by endeavoring to enter fairly and impartially
</p>
<p>into another's position by trying to understand the reasons which move
</p>
<p>men, and the creeds which sway them. Anarchy as a theory is as old as the
</p>
<p>school men of the middle ages. It was gravely debated in the monasteries,
</p>
<p>and supported by learned casuists five centuries ago. As a practice it was
</p>
<p>first taught in France, and later in Germany. It caught the unthinking,
</p>
<p>impressible throng as the proper protest against too much government and
</p>
<p>wrong government. It was ably argued by leaders capable of better things,
</p>
<p>men who turned great talents toward the destruction of society instead of
</p>
<p>its upbuilding, and the fruit of their
</p>
<p>teachings we have with us in Chicago
</p>
<p>to-day.
</p>
<p>Our Anarchy is of the German
</p>
<p>school, which is more nearly akin to
</p>
<p>Nihilism than to the doctrines taught
</p>
<p>in France. It is founded upon the teach-
</p>
<p>ings of Karl Marx and his disciples,
</p>
<p>and it aims directly at the complete
</p>
<p>destruction of all forms of government
</p>
<p>and religion. It offers no solution of
</p>
<p>the problems which will arise when
</p>
<p>society, as we understand it, shall dis-

</p>
<p>appear, but contents itself with declar-
</p>
<p>THE THEORY OF ANARCHY.
</p>
<p>ing that the duty at hand is tearing down ; that the work of building up
</p>
<p>must come later. There are several reasons why the revolutionary pro-
</p>
<p>gramme stops short at the work of Anarchy, chief among which is the fact
</p>
<p>that there are as many panaceas for the future as there are revolutionists,
</p>
<p>and it would be a hopeless task to think of binding them all to one platform
</p>
<p>of construction. The Anarchists are all agreed that the present system
</p>

<p>Their dream of the future is accordingly as many-colored as Joseph's

<p>coat. Each man has his own ideal. Engels, who is Karl Marx's successor

<p>in the leadership of the movement,
</p>
<p>believes that men will associate
</p>
<p>themselves into organizations like
</p>
<p>cooperative societies for mutual
</p>
<p>protection, support and improve-
</p>
<p>ment, and that these will be the
</p>
<p>only units in the country of a social

<p>nature. There will be no law, no

<p>church, no capital, no anything that

<p>we regard as necessary to the life

<p>of a nation.

<p>In England itself the movement has only lately won any prominence,

<p>in Modern Times." This monograph, like everything else which has come
</p>
<p>from the pen of this gifted young economist, contains so clear a state-
</p>
<p>ment and so complete a marshaling of the fa'cts that it is not necessary
</p>
<p>to go beyond it for the story of continental discontent.
</p>
<p>The French Revolution drew a broad red line across the world's history.
</p>
<p>It is the most momentous fact in the annals of modern times. There is
</p>
<p>no need for us to go behind it, or to examine its causes. We can take it
</p>
<p>as a fact as the great revolt of the common people and push on to the
</p>
<p>things that followed it.
</p>
<p>Babeuf " Gracchus " Babeuf, as he called himself after serving part
</p>
<p>of a term in prison for for-
</p>
<p>gery, escaped, went to Paris
</p>
<p>in the heat of the Revolution,
</p>
<p>and started The Tribune of
</p>
<p>the People, the first Social-
</p>
<p>istic paper ever published.
</p>
<p>He was too incendiary even
</p>
<p>for Robespierre, and was im-
</p>
<p>prisoned in 1795. In prison
</p>
<p>he formed the famous " Con-
</p>
<p>spiracy of Babeuf," which
</p>
<p>was to establish the Com-
</p>
<p>munistic republic. For this
</p>
<p>conspiracy he and Darth6
</p>
<p>were beheaded May 24, 1797.

<p>Efcienne Cabet was a So-

<p>cialist before the term was

<p>invented, but he was a peace-
</p>
<p>ful and honest one. He pub-
</p>
<p>lished, in 1842, his "Travels
</p>
<p>in Icaria," describing an ideal state. Like most political reformers, he chose
</p>
<p>the United States as the best place to try his experiment upon. It is a curi-
</p>
<p>ous fact that there is not a nation in Europe, however much of a failure it

<p>may have made of all those things that go to make up rational liberty, which
</p>
<p>does not feel itself competent to tell us just what we ought to do, instead
</p>
<p>of what we are doing. Cabet secured a grant of land on the Red River in
</p>
<p>Texas just after the Mexican War, and a colony of Icarians came out.
</p>
<p>They took the yellow fever and were dispersed before Cabet came with the
</p>
<p>second part of the colony. About this time the Mormons left Nauvoo in
</p>
<p>Illinois, and the Icarians came to take their places. The colony has since
</p>
<p>established itself at Grinnell, Iowa, and a branch is at San Bernardino,
</p>
<p>California. The Nauvoo settlement has, I believe, been abandoned.

<p>count, and a lineal descendant of Charlemagne. He fought in our War of
</p>
<p>the Revolution under Washington, and passed its concluding years in a
</p>
<p>British prison. He preached nearly the modern Socialism, the revolt of
</p>
<p>the proletariat against property, and his work has indelibly impressed
</p>
<p>itself upon the whole movement in France.
</p>
<p>Charles Fourier, born in 1772, was the son of a grocer in Besancon, and
</p>
<p>he was a man who exercised great influence upon the movement among
</p>
<p>the French. He was rather a dreamer than a man of action, and, although
</p>
<p>attempts have been made to carry his familistere into practice, there is no
</p>
<p>conspicuous success to record, save, perhaps, that of the familistere at Guise,
</p>
<p>in France, which has been
</p>
<p>conducted for a long time
</p>
<p>on the principles laid
</p>
<p>down by Fourier.
</p>
<p>All these men had be-
</p>
<p>fore them concrete
</p>
<p>schemes for a new society
</p>
<p>in which the evils of the
</p>
<p>present system would be
</p>
<p>avoided by what they con-
</p>
<p>sidered a more equable
</p>
<p>division of wealth, and
</p>
<p>each made the effort to
</p>
<p>carry his scheme from
</p>
<p>theory into practice, so
</p>
<p>that the world might see
</p>
<p>the success and imitate
</p>
<p>it. Following them came
</p>
<p>the men who held that,
</p>
<p>before the new society
</p>
<p>can be formed, the old
</p>
<p>society must be got rid of the men who see but one way towards So-
</p>
<p>cialism, and that through Anarchy.

<p>Louis Blanc was the first of these, although he would not have described
</p>
<p>himself as an Anarchist, nor would it be fair to call him one. He repre-
</p>
<p>sented the transition stage. He attempted political reforms of a most
</p>
<p>sweeping character during the revolution of 1848. The government of
</p>
<p>the day established " national work-shops " as a concession to him. Of
</p>
<p>these more is said hereafter.
</p>
<p>Pierre Joseph Proudhon, born in Besancon July 15, 1809, is really the
</p>
<p>father of French Anarchy. His great work, "What Is Property?" was
</p>
<p>published in 1840, and he declared that property was theft and property-
</p>
<p>holders thieves. It is to this epoch-making work that the whole school
</p>
<p>PIERRE JOSEPH PROUDHON.
</p>
<p>22 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>of modern Anarchy, in any of its departments, may be traced. Proudhon
</p>
<p>was fired by an actual hatred of the rich. He describes a proprietor as
</p>
<p>"essentially a libidinous animal, without virtue and without shame." The
</p>
<p>importance of his work is shown by the effect it has had even upon orthodox
</p>
<p>political economy, while on the other side it has been the inspiration of
</p>
<p>Karl Marx. Proudhon died in Passy in 1865.
</p>
<p>Since his time until within the last year or two, French Socialism has
</p>
<p>been but a reflex of the German school. It has produced no first-rates,
</p>
<p>and has been content to take its doctrine from Lassalle. Karl Marx and
</p>
<p>Engels, the leaders of the German movement, and Bakounine and Prince
</p>
<p>Krapotkin, the Russian terrorists, have impressed their ideas deeply upon
</p>
<p>the French discontented ones. The revolt of the Commune of Paris after
</p>
<p>the Franco-German war was not exactly an Anarchist uprising, although the
</p>
<p>Anarchists impressed their ideas upon much of the work done. The Com-
</p>
<p>mune of Paris means very much the same as "the people of Illinois." It
</p>
<p>is the legal designation of the commonwealth, and does not imply Com-
</p>
<p>munism any more than the word commonwealth does. It was a fight for
</p>
<p>the autonomy of Paris, and one in which many people were engaged who
</p>
<p>had no sympathy with Anarchy, although certainly the lawless element
</p>
<p>finally obtained complete control of the situation. The rising in Lyons
</p>
<p>several years later was distinctly and wholly anarchic, and it was for this
</p>
<p>that Prince Krapotkin and others were sent to prison.
</p>
<p>At the present day there is no practical distinction between Socialism
</p>
<p>and Anarchy in France. All Socialists are Anarchists as a first step,
</p>
<p>although all Anarchists are not precisely Socialists. They look to the
</p>
<p>Russian Nihilists and the German irreconcilables as their leaders.
</p>
<p>German Socialism is really the doctrine which fe- now taught all over
</p>
<p>the world, and it was this teaching that led directly to the Haymarket
</p>
<p>massacre in Chicago. It began with Karl Rodbertus, who lived from 1805
</p>
<p>to 1875. He first became prominent in Germany in 1848, and he was for
</p>
<p>some time Minister of Education and Public Worship in Prussia. He was
</p>
<p>a theorist rather than a practical reformer, but competent critics assign to
</p>
<p>him the very highest rank as a political economist. His first work was
</p>
<p>"Our Economic Condition," which was published in 1843, and his other

</p>
<p>books, which he published up to within a short time of his death, were
</p>
<p>simply elucidations of the principles he had first laid down. His writings
</p>
<p>have had a greater effect on modern Socialism than those of any other
</p>
<p>thinker, not even excepting Karl Marx or Lassalle. His theories were
</p>
<p>brought to a practical issue by Marx, who united into a compact whole
</p>
<p>the teachings of Proudhon and of Rodbertus, his own genius giving a new
</p>
<p>luster and a new value to the result. Marx is far and away the greatest
</p>
<p>man that the Socialism of the nineteenth century has produced. He was a
</p>
<p>deep student, a man of most formidable mental power, eloquent, persua-
</p>
<p>THE RED INTERNATIONALE. 23
</p>
<p>sive, and honest. His great book, " Capital." has been called the Socialist's
</p>
<p>Bible. Ely places it in the very first rank, saying of it that it is " among the
</p>
<p>ablest political economic treatises ever written." And while the best
</p>
<p>scientific thought of the age agrees that Marx was mistaken in his pre-
</p>
<p>mises and his fundamental propositions, there, is accorded to him upon
</p>
<p>every hand the tribute which profound learning pays to hard work and deep
</p>
<p>thinking.
</p>
<p>Coming from theory to practice brings us naturally from Marx to the
</p>
<p>International Society. It was founded in London in 1864 and was meant
</p>
<p>to include the whole of the labor class of Christendom. Marx was the
</p>
<p>chief, but he held the sovereignty uneasily. The Anarchists constantly
</p>
<p>antagonized him. Bakounine, the apostle of dynamite, opposed Marx at
</p>
<p>every point, and finally Marx had him expelled from the society. Bakounine
</p>
<p>thereupon formed a new Internationale, based upon anarchic principles
</p>
<p>and the gospel of force. The Internationale of which Marx was the founder
</p>
<p>has shrunk to a mere name, although the organization is still kept up, and
</p>
<p>the body with which the civilized world has now to reckon is that which
</p>
<p>Bakounine formed after his expulsion from the old body in 1872. It is a
</p>
<p>curious fact that many of the Socialists in Chicago to-day are enthusiastic
</p>
<p>admirers of Marx and at the same time members of the society and fol-
</p>
<p>lowers of the man Marx declared to be the most dangerous enemy of the
</p>
<p>modern workingman.
</p>
<p>Marx is dead, however ; many things are said in his name of which he
</p>
<p>himself would never have approved, and the " Red Internationale " pro-
</p>
<p>claims the man a saint who refused either to indorse its principles or to
</p>
<p>consult with its leaders. It is the same as though, twenty years hence,
</p>
<p>the men who last year followed Barry out of the Knights of Labor were
</p>
<p>to hold up Powderly to the world as their law-giver and their chief.
</p>
<p>Louise Michel, who was a very active worker in the radical cause during
</p>
<p>the outbreak of the Paris Commune, was born in 1830, and first attracted
</p>
<p>attention by verses full of force which she published very early in life. She
</p>
<p>was sentenced in 1871 to deportation for life, and was transported with
</p>
<p>others to New Caledonia. At the time of the general amnesty, in 1880, she
</p>
<p>returned to Paris, and became editor of La Revolution Sociale.

<p>Ferdinand Lassalle, like Marx of Hebrew blood, and of early aristo-
</p>
<p>cratic prejudices, was the father of German Anarchy as it exists to-day.
</p>
<p>He was a deep student, and a remarkably able man. He took his inspira-
</p>
<p>tion from Rodbertus and from Marx, but applied himself more to work
</p>
<p>among the poor. Marx was over the heads of the common people. His
</p>
<p>"Capital" is very hard reading. Lassalle popularized its teachings. On
</p>
<p>May 23, 1863, a few men met at Leipsic under the leadership of Lassalle
</p>
<p>and formed the " Universal German Laborers' Union." This was the
</p>
<p>foundation of Social Democracy, and its teachings were wholly anarchic.
</p>
<p>24
</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>It aimed at the subversion of the whole German social system, by peace-
</p>
<p>ful political means at first, but soon by force.
</p>
<p>Lassalle was shortly afterwards killed in a duel over a love-affair, but
</p>
<p>he was canonized by the German Social Democrats as though his death
</p>
<p>were a martyrdom. Even Bismarck in the Reichstag paid a tribute to his
</p>
<p>memory. Lassalle died just about the time that a change was occurring in
</p>
<p>his convictions, and had he lived longer, and if contemporary history is to
</p>
<p>be believed, he would have taken office under the German Government and
</p>
<p>applied himself heartily to the building up of the Empire.
</p>
<p>After Lassalle's death the movement which he had initiated went forward
</p>
<p>with increased force. The German laborer was finally, as the International-
</p>
<p>ists put it, aroused. The German
</p>
<p>Empire, following the example of
</p>
<p>the Bund, decreed universal suf-
</p>
<p>frage in 1871. Before this, in
</p>
<p>Prussia especially, the laborer had
</p>
<p>but the smallest political influ-
</p>
<p>ence. The vote of a man in the
</p>
<p>wealthiest class in Berlin counted
</p>
<p>for as much as the vote of fifteen
</p>
<p>of the "proletariat," so called.
</p>
<p>Lassalle died in 1864, and suf-
</p>
<p>frage was first granted in 1867.
</p>
<p>The Social Democrats at first
</p>
<p>were in close accord with Bis-
</p>
<p>marck. It was the Social Demo-
</p>
<p>cratic vote^ which elected Bis-
</p>
<p>marck to the Reichstag in the
</p>
<p>first election after the suffrage
</p>
<p>was granted. In the fall of 18^7
</p>
<p>they sent eight members to the
</p>
<p>parliament of the Bund. In the

<p>per cent of the whole vote of Germany at the present time.

<p>In 1878 occurred the two attempts on the life of the Emperor of Germany

<p>German Socialists, drove many of them to this country, but had no effect
</p>
<p>in diminishing the propaganda in Germany. The result was an exodus
</p>
<p>of Socialists, or rather Anarchists, to America by this time the two terms,
</p>
<p>wide apart as they may seem, had become one and to Chicago came
</p>
<p>most of the irreconcil-
</p>
<p>able ones. The Amer-
</p>
<p>ican sympathizers, thus
</p>
<p>formed, at first fixed
</p>
<p>their attention upon the
</p>
<p>political situation in the
</p>
<p>old country, and they
</p>
<p>applied themselves
</p>
<p>closely to work in con-
</p>
<p>nection with the agita-
</p>
<p>tors who had not expa-

</p>
<p>was chosen, and he

<p>of Marx, but he was honest, enthusiastic and devoted, and no man in
</p>
<p>the whole line of German political energy has left his name more
</p>
<p>thoroughly impressed upon the time. Out of these conditions and
</p>
<p>born of these ideas came the Anarchy which hurled the bomb whose
</p>
<p>crash at the Haymarket Square first aroused us to the work which is being
</p>
<p>done in our midst.
</p>
<p>The Anarchists of Chicago are exotics. Discontent here is a German
</p>
<p>plant transferred from Berlin and Leipsic and thriving to flourish in the
</p>
<p>west. In our garden it is a weed to be plucked out by the roots and
</p>
<p>26 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>destroyed, for our conditions neither warrant its growth nor excuse its
</p>
<p>existence.
</p>
<p>The central idea of all Socialistic and Anarchic systems is the interfer-
</p>
<p>ence with the right of property by society. If we can convince ourselves that
</p>
<p>society has the right and the duty thus to interfere, then there is to be said
</p>
<p>nothing more. As long as the American citizen can buy his own land and
</p>
<p>raise his own crops, as long as average industry and economy will lead a
</p>
<p>man to competence, Socialism can only be like typhus fever a growth of
</p>
<p>the city slums. There is no real danger in it. There is no peril which
</p>
<p>those charged with the protection of law and order are not ready to
</p>
<p>face, for every officer of the law that unreasonable discontent may
</p>
<p>menace is backed by the whole power of the republic ; and the republic
</p>
<p>is founded upon principles which this alien revolt can neither harm nor
</p>
<p>affright.
</p>
<p>There is a fact which, before I leave this chapter, I wish to bring home
</p>
<p>to the mind of every reader, and that is this :
</p>
<p>The police of Chicago, like the police of every city in the Union, are
</p>
<p>actuated by no feeling of hostility to these people. We understand the
</p>
<p>genesis of their movement ; we can put ourselves in their places and feel
</p>
<p>the things which actuate them ; we are prepared to make as many excuses
</p>
<p>for them as they can make for themselves ; we are ready to grant every-
</p>
<p>thing that they could claim, and more ; but we see beyond this, and above
</p>
<p>this, facts which they forget and forego.
</p>
<p>We have a government in these United States so firm and so elastic
</p>
<p>that it has every bulwark against either foreign or domestic attack, and yet
</p>
<p>it provides every opportunity to adjust itself to the will of the people.
</p>
<p>The majority must rule, and does rule ; but fmder our Constitution it
</p>
<p>rules only along lines decreed by the fathers long ago for the protection of
</p>
<p>the minority. There is a legal and constitutional means provided for every
</p>
<p>man to carry his theories of good government into actual practice. Every
</p>
<p>citizen has the right to vote, and to have his vote counted, and this right
</p>
<p>belongs to Anarchist and conservative, to radical and reactionist. There
</p>
<p>is no man can stand before the American people and say we have refused
</p>
<p>him his right : if it were done, the whole power of the Government would

<p>man with a means to impress his convictions upon the government of the
</p>
<p>country when we have done everything that human ingenuity can do to
</p>
<p>secure a full and free expression of the popular will, as the final and
</p>
<p>supreme test upon every public question, we may be excused for refusing
</p>
<p>to let the Anarchists have their way. They are a minority of a minority,
</p>
<p>yet they would impose their system and their doctrine upon the majority^
</p>
<p>They would substitute for the ballot-box the dynamite bomb for the will
</p>
<p>of the people the will of a contemptible rabble of discontents, un-Ameri-

</p>
<p>Thus, while the police entertain no animosity against these men, we

<p>feel I feel and every officer under my command feels that we are bound
</p>
<p>by our oaths and by our loyalty to the State and to society to meet force

</p>
<p>THE attempt to gain political ends by an appeal to infernal machines
</p>
<p>is not a new one. It is as old as gunpowder and the evangel of
</p>
<p>assassination is older still. Murder was the recognized political weapon
</p>
<p>of the Eastern and Western Empires, and the Chicago Anarchists have
</p>
<p>proved themselves neither better nor worse than the "old man of the
</p>
<p>mountain " or the Italian princes of the middle ages. During the reign of
</p>
<p>Mary Queen of Scots the mysterious explosion occurred in the Kirk of Feld
</p>
<p>in which Darnley lost his life. Somewhat later was the "gunpowder plot,"
</p>
<p>in which Guy Fawkes and his fellow conspirators tried to blow up the Houses
</p>
<p>of Parliament. The petard and the hand-grenade were the grandfather and
</p>
<p>the grandmother of the modern bomb, and murderous invention came to its
</p>
<p>new phase in the infernal machine which Ceruchi, Jhe Italian sculptor, con-
</p>
<p>trived to kill Napoleon when First Consul a catastrophe which was avoided
</p>
<p>by the fact that Napoleon's coachman was drunk and took the wrong turn in
</p>
<p>going to the opera-house.
</p>
<p>France was fertile in this sort of machinery. Some years later Fieschi,
</p>
<p>Morey and Pepin tried to kill Louis Philippe with a similar apparatus on the
</p>
<p>Boulevard de Temple. The King escaped, but the brave Marshal Mortier was
</p>
<p>slain. Orsini and Pieri made a bomb, round and bristling with nippers,
</p>
<p>each of which was charged with fulminate of mercury, to explode the powder
</p>
<p>within, meaning to assassinate the Emperor Napoleon and the Empress

<p>Eugenie.
</p>
<p>In the year 1866, according to the most trustworthy authorities, dynamite
</p>
<p>was first made by Alfred Nobel. In speaking of the invention, Adolf Hous-
</p>
<p>saye, the French litterateur, recently said :
</p>
<p>It should be remembered that nine-tenths, probably, of the dynamite made is used in
</p>
<p>peaceful pursuits ; in mining, and similar works. Indeed, since its invention great engineer-
</p>
<p>ing achievements have been accomplished which would have been entirely impossible without
</p>
<p>it. I do not see, then, much room for doubt that it has on the whole been a great blessing
</p>
<p>NITRO-GLYCERINE AND DYNAMITE. 29
</p>
<p>to humanity. Such certainly its inventor regards it. " If I did not look upon it as such," I
</p>
<p>heard him say recently, " I should close up all my manufactories and not make another ounce
</p>
<p>of the stuff." He is a strong advocate of peace, and regards with the utmost horror the use
</p>
<p>of dynamite by assassins and political conspirators. When the news of the Haymarket trag-
</p>
<p>edy in Chicago reached him, M. Nobel was in Paris, and I well remember his expressions of
</p>
<p>horror and detestation at the cowardly crime.
</p>
<p>"Look you," he exclaimed. " I am a man of peace. But when I see these miscreants
</p>
<p>misusing my invention, do you know how it makes me feel? It makes me feel like gathering
</p>
<p>the whole crowd of them into a storehouse full of dynamite and blowing them all up to-
</p>
<p>gether ! "
</p>
<p>Few people know what dynamite is, though it has attracted a good deal
</p>
<p>of attention of late, and before considering its use as a mode for political
</p>
<p>murder it may be well here to give an account of its making.
</p>
<p>Nitro-glycerine, although not the strongest explosive known to science,
</p>
<p>is the only one of any industrial importance, as the others are too dangerous
</p>
<p>for manufacture. It was discovered by Salvero, an Italian chemist, in 1845.
</p>
<p>It is composed of glycerine and nitric acid compounded together in a certain
</p>
<p>proportion, and at a certain temperature. It is very unsafe to handle, and
</p>
<p>to this reason is to be .ascribed the invention of dynamite, which is, after all,
</p>
<p>merely a sort of earth and nitro-glycerine, the use of the earth being to hold
</p>
<p>the explosive safely as a piece of blotting-paper would hold water until it
</p>
<p>was needed. Nobel first tried kieselguhr, or flint froth, which was groimd
</p>
<p>to a powder, heated thoroughly and dried, and the nitro-glycerine was
</p>
<p>kneaded into it like so much dough. Of course, many other substances are
</p>
<p>now used, besides infusorial earth, as vehicles for the explosive saw-
</p>
<p>dust, rotten-stone, charcoal, plaster of Paris, black powder, etc., etc. These
</p>
<p>are all forms of dynamite or giant powder, and mean the same thing.
</p>
<p>When the substance is thoroughly kneaded, work that must be done with
</p>
<p>the hands, it is molded into sticks somewhat like big candles, and wrapped
</p>
<p>in parchment paper. Nitro-glycerine has a sweet, aromatic, pungent taste,
</p>
<p>and the peculiar property of causing ' a violent headache when placed
</p>
<p>on the tongue or the wrist. It freezes at 40 Fahrenheit, and must
</p>
<p>be melted by the application of water at a temperature of 100. In
</p>
<p>dynamite the usual proportions are 25 per cent, of earth and 75 per cent, of

</p>
<p>nitro-glycerine. The explosive is fired by fulminate of silver or mercury
</p>
<p>in copper caps.
</p>
<p>Outside of the French arsenals it is to be doubted if anybody knows
</p>
<p>anything more about the new explosive, melinite, further than that it is one of
</p>
<p>the compounds of picric acid and picric acid is a more frightful explosive
</p>
<p>than nitro-glycerine. I find in my scrap-book the following excerpt from the
</p>
<p>London Standard, describing the artillery experiments at Lydd with the new
</p>
<p>explosive which the British Admiralty has lately been examining. The
</p>
<p>Standard, after declaring that the experiments are " entirely satisfactory, "
</p>
<p>says :
</p>
<p>3 o ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>The character of the compound employed is said to be " akin to melinite, " but its precise
</p>
<p>nature is not divulged. We have reason to believe that the "kinship" is very close. The
</p>
<p>details of the experiments which have lately been conducted at Lydd are known to very few
</p>
<p>individuals. But it is unquestionable that the results were such as demonstrate the enor-
</p>
<p>mous advantage to be gained by using a more powerful class of explosives than that which
</p>
<p>has been hitherto employed. There could be no mistake as to the destructive energy of the
</p>
<p>projectiles. Neither was there any mishap in the use of these terrible appliances. The like
</p>
<p>immunity was enjoyed at Portsmouth. A deterrent to the adoption of violent explosives for
</p>
<p>war purposes has consisted in the risk of premature explosion. But there is still the con-
</p>
<p>sideration that the advantage to be gained far exceeds the risk which has to be incurred.
</p>
<p>France has not neglected this question, and she is ahead of us. Her chosen explosive is
</p>
<p>melinite, and with this she has armed herself to an extent of which the British public has no
</p>
<p>conception. All the requisite materials, in the shape of steel projectiles and the melinite for
</p>
<p>filling them, have been provided for the French service and distributed so as to furnish a
</p>
<p>complete supply for the army and the navy. Whatever may be said as to the danger which
</p>
<p>besets the use of melinite, the French authorities are confident that they have mastered the
</p>
<p>problem of making this powerful compound subservient to the purposes of war. Concerning
</p>
<p>the composition of this explosive great secrecy is observed by the French Government, as
</p>
<p>also with regard to the experiments that are made with it. But Col. Majendie states that
</p>
<p>melinite is largely composed of picric acid in a fused or consolidated condition. Of the violence
</p>
<p>with which picric acid will explode, an example was given on the occasion of a fire at some
</p>
<p>chemical works near Manchester a year ago. The shock was felt over a distance of two
</p>
<p>miles from the seat of the explosion, and the sound was heard for a distance of twenty miles.
</p>
<p>The conduct of the French in committing themselves so absolutely to the use of melinite
</p>
<p>as a materiel of war clearly signifies that with them the use of such a substance has passed
</p>
<p>out of the region of doubt and experiment. Their experimental investigations extended over
</p>
<p>a considerable period of time, but at last the stage of inquiry gave place to one of confidence
</p>
<p>and assurance. So great is the confidence of the French Government in the new shell that
</p>
<p>it is said the French forts are henceforth to be protected by a composite material better
</p>
<p>adapted than iron or steel to resist the force of a projectile charged with a high explosive. In
</p>
<p>naval warfare the value of shells charged in this manner is likely to be more especially
</p>
<p>shown in connection with the rapid-fire guns which are now coming into use. The question
</p>
<p>is whether the ponderous staccato fire of monster ordnance may not be largely superseded
</p>
<p>by another mode of attack, in which a storm of shells, charged with something far more

</p>
<p>potent than gunpowder, will be poured forth in a constant stream from numerous guns of
</p>
<p>comparatively small weight and caliber.
</p>
<p>Combined with rapidity of fire, these shells cannot but prove formidable to an armor-
</p>
<p>clad, independently of any damage inflicted on the plates. The great thickness now given
</p>
<p>to ship armor is accomplished by a mode of concentration which, while affecting to shield
</p>
<p>the vital parts, leaves a large portion of the ship entirely unprotected. On the unarmored
</p>
<p>portion a tremendous effect will be produced by the quick-firing guns dashing their powerful
</p>
<p>shells in a fiery deluge on the ship.
</p>
<p>Altogether the new force which is now entering into the composition of artillery is one
</p>
<p>which demands the attention of the British Government in the form of prompt and vigorous
</p>
<p>action. While we are experimenting, others are arming.
</p>
<p>Dynamite, however, is the weapon with which the "revolution" has
</p>
<p>armed itself for its assault upon society. A terrible arm truly, but one
</p>
<p>difficult to handle, dangerous to hold, and certainly no stronger in their
</p>
<p>hands than in ours, if it should ever become necessary to use it in defense
</p>
<p>of law and order.
</p>
<p>THE NIHILIST PLATFORM. 31
</p>
<p>A number of Russian chemists, members of the Nihilist party, were the
</p>
<p>first to apply dynamite to the work of murder. It is to their researches that
</p>
<p>is to be credited the invention of the " black jelly," so called, of which so
</p>
<p>much was expected, and by which so little was done.
</p>
<p>Nihilist activity in Russia commenced almost as soon as the emancipated
</p>
<p>peasantry began to be in condition for the evangel of discontent. It was
</p>
<p>Tourgeneff, the novelist, who baptized the movement with its name of
</p>
<p>Nihilism and the truth is that it is a movement rather than an organization.
</p>
<p>It is a loose, uncentralized, uncodified society, secret by necessity and mur-
</p>
<p>derous by be.lief ; but it is a secret society without grips or passwords, with-
</p>
<p>out a purpose save indiscriminate destruction, and its very formlessness and
</p>
<p>vagueness have been its chief protection from the Russian police, who are,
</p>
<p>perhaps, after all is said and done, the best police in the world. A state-
</p>
<p>ment of Nihilism by that very famous Nihilist who is known as Stepniak,
</p>
<p>but who is suspected to be entitled to a much more illustrious name, runs
</p>
<p>thus :
</p>
<p>By our general conviction we are Socialists and democrats. We are convinced that on
</p>
<p>Socialistic grounds humanity can become the embodiment of freedom, equality and frater-
</p>
<p>nity, while it secures for itself a general prosperity, a harmonious development of man and
</p>
<p>his social progress. We are convinced, moreover, that only the will of the people should
</p>
<p>give sanction to any social institution, and that the development of the nation is sound only
</p>
<p>when free and independent and when every idea in practical use shall have previously passed
</p>
<p>the test of national consideration and of the national will. We further think that as Social-
</p>
<p>ists and democrats we must first recognize an immediate purpose to liberate the nation from
</p>
<p>its present state of oppression by creating a political revolution. We would thus transfer the
</p>
<p>supreme power into the hands of the people. We think that the will of the nation should
</p>
<p>be expressed with perfect clearness, and best, by a National Assembly freely elected by the
</p>
<p>votes of all the citizens, the representatives to be carefully instructed by their constituents.
</p>
<p>We do not consider this as the ideal form of expressing the people's will, but as the most
</p>
<p>acceptable form to be realized in practice. Submitting ourselves to the will of the nation,
</p>
<p>we, as a party, feel bound to appear before our own country with our own programme or
</p>
<p>platform, which we shall propagate even before the revolution, recommend to the electors
</p>
<p>during electoral periods, and afterwards defend in the National Assembly.
</p>
<p>The Nihilist programme in Russia has been officially formulated thus :

<p>First The permanent Representative Assembly to have supreme control and direction in
</p>
<p>all general state questions.
</p>
<p>Second In the provinces, self-government to a large extent ; to secure it, all public func-
</p>
<p>tionaries to be elected.
</p>
<p>Third To secure the independence of the Village Commune ("Mir") as an economical
</p>
<p>and administrative unit.
</p>
<p>Fourth All the land to be proclaimed national property.
</p>
<p>Fifth A series of nTeasures preparatory to a final transfer of ownership in manufactures
</p>
<p>to the workmen.
</p>
<p>Sixth Perfect liberty of conscience, of the press, speech, meetings, associations and
</p>
<p>electoral agitation.
</p>
<p>Seventh The right to vote to be extended to all citizens of legal age. without class or
</p>
<p>property restrictions.
</p>
<p>Eighth Abolition of the standing army ; the army to be replaced by a territorial militia.
</p>
<p>32 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>It must be remembered that the conditions in Russia are peculiar. The
</p>
<p>country is ruled by an autocracy ; government is not by the people, but by
</p>
<p>"divine right." The conditions which the English-speaking people ended
</p>
<p>at Runnymede still exist in Muscovy. There is neither free speech, free
</p>
<p>assembly, nor a free press, and naturally discontent vents itself in revolt.
</p>
<p>There is no safety-valve. Russia is full of generous, high-minded young
</p>
<p>men and women, who find their church dead, and their state a cruel des-
</p>
<p>potism. They find themselves face to face with the White Terror, and they
</p>
<p>have sought in the Red Terror a relief. Flying at last from the hopeless
</p>
<p>contest, they have carried the hate of government born of bad ruling into
</p>
<p>Western Europe, and it is the infection of this poison that we have to deal
</p>
<p>with here. The average Russian .Nihilist is a young man or a young woman
</p>
<p>very often the latter who, by the contemplation of real wrongs and falla-
</p>
<p>cious remedies, has come to be the implacable enemy of all order and all
</p>
<p>system. Usually they are half-educated, with just that superficial smatter-
</p>
<p>ing of knowledge to make them conceited in their own opinions, but without
</p>
<p>enough real learning to make them either impartial critics or safe citizens of
</p>
<p>non-Russian countries. We can pity them, for it is easy to see how step by
</p>
<p>step they have been pushed into revolt. But they are dangerous.
</p>
<p>When one reads such a case as that which gave Vera Sassoulitch her
</p>
<p>notoriety, it is easier to understand Russia. General Trepoff, the Chief of
</p>
<p>Police of St. Petersburg, had arrested Vera's lover on suspicion of high
</p>
<p>treason. The young man was by Trepoff's order frequently flogged to make
</p>
<p>him confess his crime. Sassoulitch called on Trepoff and shot him. She
</p>
<p>was tried by a St. Petersburg jury and acquitted. Immediately a law was
</p>
<p>declared that no case of political crime should be tried by a jury, except
</p>
<p>when the Government had selected it. The arrest of the woman was ordered
</p>
<p>that she might be tried again under the iiew regulation, but in the meantime
</p>
<p>her friends had spirited her away.
</p>
<p>A very similar crime was that attempted by another Nihilist heroine,
</p>
<p>Maria Kaliouchnaia, who attempted to kill Col. Katauski for his severity to
</p>
<p>her brother. In the assassination of the Czar, as I shall relate, a number of
</p>
<p>women were concerned, and their bravery was greatly more desperate than
</p>
<p>that of their male companions. The Russian woman is peculiar. I know

<p>no better picture of the "devoted ones" than that given in Tourgeneff's
</p>
<p>"Verses in Prose":
</p>
<p>I see a huge building with a narrow door in its front wall ; the door is 1 open, and a dismal
</p>
<p>darkness stretches beyond. Before the high threshold stands a girl a Russian girl. Frost
</p>
<p>breathes out of the impenetrable darkness, and with the icy draught from the depths of the
</p>
<p>building there comes forth a slow and hollow voice :
</p>
<p>"Oh, thou who art wanting to cross this threshold, dost thou know what awaits thee ?"
</p>
<p>" I know it," answers the girl.
</p>
<p>"Cold, hunger, hatred, derision, contempt, insults, a fearful death even."
</p>
<p>" I know it."
</p>
<p>THE RUSSIAN TERRORISTS.
</p>
<p>33
</p>
<p>" Complete isolation and separation from all ? "
</p>
<p>" I know it. I am ready. I will bear all sorrows and miseries."
</p>
<p>"Not only if inflicted by enemies, but when done by kindred and friends ?"
</p>
<p>"Yes, even when done by them."
</p>
<p>" Well, are you ready for self-sacrifice ? "
</p>
<p>"Yes!"
</p>
<p>" For anonymous self-sacrifice ? You shall die, and nobody shall know even whose
</p>
<p>memory is to be honored ? "
</p>
<p>" I want neither .gratitude nor pity. I want no name."
</p>
<p>" Are you ready for a crime ? "
</p>
<p>The girl bent her head. " I am ready even for a crime."
</p>
<p>The voice paused awhile before renewing its interrogatories. Then again : ' ' Dost thou
</p>
<p>know," it said at last, " that thou mayest lose thy faith in what thou now believest ; that thou
</p>
<p>mayest feel that thou hast been mistaken and hast lost thy young life in vain ? "
</p>
<p>" I know that also, and nevertheless I will enter ! "
</p>
<p>" Enter, then ! "
</p>
<p>The girl crossed the threshold, and a heavy curtain fell behind her.
</p>
<p>" A fool ! " gnashed some one outside.
</p>
<p>" A saint ! " answered a voice from somewhere.
</p>
<p>With such material it was not difficult to build up the tragedy of 1881.
</p>
<p>Before the day of
</p>
<p>the Czar's death
</p>
<p>came, there had
</p>
<p>been despera te
</p>
<p>attempts upon
</p>
<p>his life. Prince Kra-
</p>
<p>potkin, a relative of
</p>
<p>the Nihilist of the
</p>
<p>same name, was
</p>
<p>murdered in Feb-
</p>

</p>
<p>peror.
</p>
<p>For instance, in November, 1879, was the mine laid at Moscow. It was
</p>
<p>intended to blow up the railway train upon which the Czar was to enter the
</p>
<p>city, and for this purpose Solovieff and his comrades laid three dynamite
</p>
<p>mines under the tracks. Hartmann, who subsequently figured in the
</p>
<p>assassination, was one of the leaders, and here, too, was Sophie Peroosky,
</p>
<p>another of the regicides. They hired a house near the railway tracks and
</p>
<p>tunneled under the road amidst incredible difficulties and always in the
</p>
<p>most imminent danger. One hundred and twenty pounds of dynamite

<p>perial one on which he was expected, and his life was saved. On February
</p>
<p>5, 1880, the mine under the Winter Palace was exploded ; eleven persons
</p>
<p>were killed, but again the Czar escaped.
</p>
<p>For some time before March 13, 1881, Gen. Count Loris Melikoff, the
</p>
<p>officer responsible for the safety of Czar Alexander II., had received dis-
</p>
<p>quieting reports which gave him the greatest anxiety. On the loth of the
</p>
<p>month Jelaboff, the ringleader of the conspiracy, was arrested by accident,
</p>
<p>and the direction of the attempt on the Czar's life was accordingly left to
</p>
<p>Sophie Perowskaja, a young, pretty and highly educated noblewoman, who
</p>
<p>had left everything to join the Nihilists. It is said that on the morning of
</p>
<p>the 1 3th Melikoff begged the Czar to forego his purpose of reviewing the
</p>
<p>Marine Corps, and keep within the palace. The Emperor laughed at him,
</p>
<p>and declared there was no danger. There was no incident until after the
</p>
<p>review. As the Emperor drove back beside the Ekaterinofsky Canal, just op-
</p>
<p>posite the imperial stables, a young woman on the other side of the canal
</p>
<p>fluttered a handkerchief, and immediately a man started out from the crowd
</p>
<p>that was watching the passing of the Czar, and threw a bomb under the
</p>
<p>closed carriage. There was a roaring explosion, a cloud of smoke. The
</p>
<p>rear of the vehicle was blown away, and the horror-stricken multitude saw
</p>
<p>the Czar standing unhurt, staring about him. On the ground were several
</p>
<p>members of the Life Guard, groaning and writhing in pain. The assassin had
</p>
<p>pulled out a revolver to complete his work, but he was at once mobbed by
</p>
<p>the people. Col. Dvorjitsky and Captains Kock and Kulebiekan, of the
</p>
<p>guards, rushed up to their master and asked him if he was hurt.
</p>
<p>"Thank God! no," said the Czar. "Come, let us look after the
</p>
<p>wounded."
</p>
<p>And he started toward one of the Cossacks.
</p>
<p>"It is too soon to thank God yet, Alexander Nicolaivitch," said a clear,
</p>
<p>threatening voice in the crowd, and before any one could stop him, a young
</p>
<p>man bounded forward, lifted up both arms above his head, and brought
</p>
<p>them down with a swing. There was a crash of dynamite, a blaze, a smoke,
</p>
<p>and the autocrat of all the Russias was lying on the bloody snow, with his
</p>
<p>murderer also dying in front of him. Col. Dvorjitsky lifted up the Czar,
</p>
<p>who whispered :

<p>"I am cold, my friend, so cold, take me to the Winter Palace to
</p>
<p>die."
</p>
<p>The desperate Nihilist had thrown his bomb right between the Czar's
</p>
<p>feet, and had sacrificed his own life to kill the Emperor.
</p>
<p>Alexander was shockingly mutilated. Both of his legs were broken, and
</p>
<p>the lower part of his body was frightfully torn and mangled. The assassin
</p>
<p>his name was Nicholas Elnikoff, of Wilna was even more badly hurt.
</p>
<p>He died at once.

</p>
<p>believe that he died on the way there:
</p>
<p>In the meantime the police, with the utmost difficulty, rescued the first

<p>bomb-thrower from the maddened mob. The man, whose name proved tc

<p>be Risakoff, coolly thanked the officers for preserving him, and then tried
</p>
<p>to swallow some poison
</p>
<p>which he had ready. In
</p>
<p>this he was foiled, and he
</p>
<p>was taken to prison.
</p>
<p>The infernal machine
</p>
<p>used by Elnikoff was about
</p>
<p>7^ inches in height, and

<p>tubes, fuses and other articles. Jelaboff had
</p>
<p>been living here with a woman who was called Lidia Voinoff. This Lidia
</p>
<p>Voinoff was arrested on the Newsky Prospect, on. March 22nd, and almost
</p>
<p>immediately identified as Sophia Perowskaja, the young woman who had
</p>
<p>given the handkerchief signal to the bomb-throwers, and who was wanted
</p>
<p>besides for the Moscow railway mine case. On the prisoner were found
</p>
<p>papers which led to the search of a house on Telejewskaia Street, where a
</p>
<p>man named Sablin committed suicide immediately on the appearance of
</p>
<p>the police, and a woman named Hessy Helfmann was arrested. A regular

</p>
<p>Petersburg, with the Czar's usual routes marked upon them, copies of
</p>
<p>papers from the secret press, etc., were found. While the police were still
</p>
<p>engaged in the search of the premises Timothy Mikhaeloff came in by
</p>
<p>accident. He was taken, and on him was found a copy of the new Czar's
</p>
<p>proclamation, and penciled on the back were the names of three shops with
</p>
<p>three different hours in the afternoon. The officers descended on these
</p>
<p>places and gathered in customers, shop-keepers and everybody else about
</p>
<p>the place, a process which brought in Kibaltchik, the .Nihilist chemist and
</p>
<p>bomb-maker.
</p>
<p>The evidence was soon got in shape, and* early in April the trial began.
</p>
<p>It was shown that Jelaboff was agent in the third degree of the Revolutionary
</p>
<p>Executive Committee ; that he had issued the call for volunteers for the
</p>
<p>killing of the Czar, and that forty-seven persons had offered themselves, out
</p>
<p>of whom Risakoff, Mikhaeloff, Hessy Helfmann, Kibaltchik, Sophia Perows-
</p>
<p>kaja and Elnikoff had been accepted. Elnikoff was dead, but the others,
</p>
<p>with Jelaboff, were put in the dock. They all confessed except Hessy
</p>
<p>Helfmann, and upon April nth all were condemned to death, with the
</p>
<p>proviso needed under the Russian law that the sentence of Sophia Perows-
</p>
<p>kaja should be approved by the Czar, as she was a member of the class of
</p>
<p>nobles, and a noble may not be put to death without the Emperor's concur-
</p>
<p>rence. The Czar concurred, and on April i5th, at 9 a. m., all the prisoners
</p>
<p>save Hessy Helfmann were hung. This woman was reprieved because she
</p>
<p>was about to become a mother. The execution was a most brutal one. It
</p>
<p>took place on a plain two miles out of the city, in the presence of a hundred
</p>
<p>thousand people. The prisoners were taken out of the fortress on two-wheeled
</p>
<p>carts, surrounded by drummers and pipers, who played continuously and
</p>
<p>loudly, so that nothing the condemned might say could be heard by the
</p>
<p>crowd. At the scaffold the drummers were stationed in a hollow square
</p>
<p>around the gallows, and a deafening tattoo was kept up from the time the pris-
</p>
<p>oners were brought in until their bodies were cut down. The hanging was
</p>
<p>very cruel. Each person was mounted on a small box, after kissing each
</p>
<p>other passionately all round. They said something, but it could not be
</p>
<p>heard for the drumming. The executioner was said to be evidently drunk.

<p>There was no drop. When the signal was given the condemned were
</p>
<p>pushed off their boxes and left to strangle. Mikhaeloff's rope broke twice,
</p>
<p>and the attendants held him up while the excecutioner tied a new cord around
</p>
<p>his neck and over the beam. The bodies were buried privately.
</p>
<p>The present Czar has had several narrow escapes, none of them more
</p>
<p>nearly fatal than the conspiracy of the book-bomb in March last. On the
</p>
<p>1 3th of March, 1888, the anniversary of his father's terrible death, the Czar
</p>
<p>made the usual visit to the Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul, where the body
</p>
<p>of Alexander II. is buried. For some time before the ceremony St. Peters-

</p>
<p>burg was full of rumors that a catastrophe was impending, and, although
</p>
<p>the police took the most careful precautions, the Czar himself paid no atten-
</p>
<p>tion to the warnings of the " Third Section," and would permit no alteration
</p>
<p>in the preparations for the requiem.
</p>
<p>In Christmas week of 1887, the Russian agents at Geneva, in Switzer-
</p>
<p>land, reported the presence in that city of two revolutionary agents who
</p>
<p>seemed to have the closest relations with the committee of the discontents
</p>
<p>in London and Paris. They were shadowed for a time, but lost. In Feb-
</p>
<p>ruary they reappeared in Berlin. They were known to be in communication
</p>
<p>with the St. Petersburg Nihilists. Before facts enough had accumulated to
</p>
<p>justify their arrest they disappeared once more and were believed to have

</p>
<p>In solemnizing the requiem of the late -Czar a public progress was made
</p>
<p>to the Cathedral, amid a dense throng of citizens, among whom were all the
</p>
<p>detectives that Chief Gresser could get together. In a small caf6 in one of
</p>
<p>the side streets of the Morokaya two of the detectives ran across a couple
</p>
<p>of uniformed university students in Russia the students have a peculiar
</p>
<p>costume who were acting suspiciously. They were conversing in a most
</p>
<p>excited manner with a man dressed as a peasant. The trio were watched.
</p>
<p>At the caf door they separated, but all three made by different routes for

</p>
<p>the other two were kept in sight, and the suspicions of the police were made
</p>
<p>all the more keen by the fact that the young men passed each other in the
</p>
<p>crowd several times with an elaborate appearance of not knowing each
</p>
<p>other. One of them had a law-book in his hand ; the other had a traveling-
</p>
<p>bag over his shoulder.
</p>
<p>A few moments before the Czar was to pass on his return from the Cathe-
</p>
<p>dral the students came together and whispered, and the two were imme-
</p>
<p>diately and quietly arrested. Their names were given as Andreieffsky and
</p>
<p>Petroff, university students, and this was proven to be the truth.
</p>
<p>A thrilling discovery was made, however, at once. The innocent-looking
</p>
<p>law-book was really a most dangerous infernal machine sufficiently power-
</p>
<p>ful not alone to kill everybody in the Czar's carriage, but many in the crowd,
</p>
<p>and perhaps to have
</p>
<p>blown down some of
</p>
<p>the neighboring
</p>
<p>houses. The travel-
</p>
<p>ing-sack was full of
</p>
<p>dynamite bombs of
</p>
<p>the ordinary spher-
</p>
<p>ical pattern.
</p>
<p>I reproduce here a
</p>
<p>diagram of the book-
</p>
<p>bomb from the excel-
</p>
<p>lent account of the
</p>
<p>attempted assassina-
</p>
<p>tion given by the Ne'w York World a few days after it occurred.
</p>
<p>The outside was made of wood and pasteboard, so artistically that only
</p>
<p>the closest inspection would discover the fact that the machine was not
</p>
<p>really a book. In the center of the interior, in the place marked C, were
</p>
<p>a number of hollow bullets filled with strychnine, which poison was also
</p>
<p>plastered upon the outside of the missiles. Above this were small compart-
</p>
<p>ments filled with fulminate, with a glass tube of sulphuric acid. To the
</p>
<p>tube was tied a string, which would break it when thrown, spilling it into

<p>the fulminate and thus exploding the dynamite -with which the whole of the
</p>
<p>hollow parts of the interior was densely packed. Fully a hundred people
</p>
<p>must have been killed had the bomb been exploded as intended. The
</p>
<p>expert who examined the bomb, after handling the bullets carelessly put his
</p>
<p>finger in his mouth, and was seriously, though not fatally, poisoned.

<p>Hardly bad the arrest been made when the Czar was notified at the
</p>
<p>Cathedral. He ordered that the news should be withheld from the Empress,
</p>
<p>although he was himself visibly affected. He sprang into his sleigh with
</p>
<p>the Czarowitz, and drove by an unused route to the railway station. The
</p>
<p>Czarina followed shortly after in a carriage, greatly agitated by a presenti-

<p>ment of evil. Not until the train had started was she informed of the occur-
</p>
<p>rence. She burst into tears, and was inconsolable for the rest of the journey.
</p>
<p>Once safe in his Gatschina Palace, the Czar is said to have given vent to his
</p>
<p>feelings in the strongest language, heaping anathemas upon the heads of the
</p>
<p>Nihilists, and threatening dire revenge.
</p>
<p>Less than two hours after the arrest of Andreieffsky and Petroff their
</p>
<p>companion peasant fell into the hands of the police. His name was Gene-
</p>
<p>raloff, a native of Jaroslav, South Russia. He had been actively engaged
</p>
<p>in the Nihilist propaganda for some time past. He also carried bombs on
</p>
<p>his person.
</p>
<p>These arrests were supplemented by numerous others. The lodgings of
</p>
<p>the prisoners in the suburbs of St. Petersburg known as the Peski (the Sands)
</p>
<p>were searched, and other explosives as well as documents incriminating
</p>
<p>other persons were found. As a result the procession of prisoners to the
</p>
<p>Peter and Paul's Fortress for a time was almost unremitting, and no one
</p>
<p>felt safe against police intrusion. All three of the prisoners were subse-
</p>
<p>quently executed.
</p>
<p>England shortly afterward became the mark for the next development
</p>
<p>of the dynamite war. It is the fact that shortly after the assassination of
</p>
<p>the Czar an attack on the British Government was begun.
</p>
<p>Prior to this there had been two outrages in 1881 one an attempt to
</p>
<p>blow up the barracks at Salford with dynamite, the other a gunpowder
</p>
<p>explosion at the Mansion House, London.
</p>
<p>The record of the year, as compiled by Col. Majendie, the Inspector of
</p>
<p>Explosives, then runs on :
</p>
<p>1881 : 16 May. Attempt to blow up the police barracks at Liverpool with gunpowder in
</p>

<p>a time fuse depending upon the percolation of acid through parchment. In
</p>
<p>every case, however, the destruction wrought by the explosives was ridicul-
</p>
<p>ously disappointing to the conspirators, and in England as elsewhere the

<p>event proved that high explosives are- a delusion and a snare from the

</p>
<p>AFTER the enactment of the stringent Socialist law in Germany, and
</p>
<p>the determined opposition of Prince Bismarck to the creed of the
</p>
<p>Social Democrats, the exodus to America began, and Chicago, unfortu-
</p>
<p>nately for this city, was the Mecca to which the exiles came. At first but
</p>
<p>little attention was paid to the incoming people. It was thought that free
</p>
<p>air and free institutions would disarm them of their rancor against organized
</p>
<p>society, and but little attention was paid to the ^aporings of the leaders.
</p>
<p>We had heard that sort of thing before, especially in* the years following
</p>
<p>1848, and it had come to nothing ; and people generally, when they heard
</p>
<p>the mouthings of the apostles of disorder, told themselves that when these
</p>
<p>apostles had each bought a home, there would come naturally, and out of
</p>
<p>the logic of facts, a change in their convictions.
</p>
<p>Hence, although there were some inflammatory speeches, and a pretense
</p>
<p>of Socialistic activity, it was not until the year 1873 that any serious atten-
</p>
<p>tion was paid to the movement. Even then the interest it excited was that
</p>
<p>solely of a political novelty.
</p>
<p>The period was one of general business depression, however, and addi-
</p>
<p>tional impetus was given to the feelings of discontent by the labor troubles
</p>
<p>in New York, Boston, St. Louis and other large cities. In New York the
</p>
<p>labor demonstrations were particularly violent. The special object sought

</p>
<p>to be accomplished there was the introduction of the eight-hour system.
</p>
<p>Eastern Internationalists saw in this an opportunity to strengthen their
</p>
<p>foothold in America, and they were not slow in fomenting discord among
</p>
<p>the members of the different trades-unions which had inaugurated the
</p>
<p>movement. They even went so far as to proclaim that, if there was any
</p>
<p>interference with the eight-hour strike, the streets would run red with the
</p>
<p>blood of capitalists. The Communists of Chicago sympathized with their
</p>
<p>brethren in the East, but they lacked numbers and similar conditions of
</p>
<p>THE SOCIALISTS IN POLITICS. 45
</p>
<p>violent discontent to urge force and bloodshed in the attainment of the same
</p>
<p>object, which, however, had been for some time under discussion by the
</p>
<p>Trades Assembly of Chicago. They consequently contented themselves
</p>
<p>with wild attacks upon the prevailing system of labor and urged a severance
</p>
<p>from existing political parties and the formation of a party exclusively
</p>
<p>devoted to the amelioration of the condition of workingmen.
</p>
<p>Toward the end of the year 1873, the leaders seem to have concluded
</p>
<p>that they had a sufficient number of adherents to form a party, and a com-
</p>
<p>mittee was appointed to prepare and submit a plan of organization. On
</p>
<p>the ist of January following, this committee reported. They suggested
</p>
<p>organization into societies according to nationalities, and that all societies
</p>
<p>thus organized should be directed by a central committee, to be appointed
</p>
<p>from- the several sections. At the same time it was publicly announced that
</p>
<p>"the new organization did not seek the overthrow of the national, State or
</p>
<p>city government by violence," but would work out its mission peaceably
</p>
<p>through the ballot-box.
</p>
<p>While the formation of a party was under consideration, times were
</p>
<p>exceedingly dull in the city. Thousands were idle, and there was a general
</p>
<p>clamor among the unemployed for relief. This discontent was seized upon
</p>
<p>to influence the minds of the poor against capital, and the remedy was
</p>
<p>declared to lie only in Socialism. The Relief and Aid Society formed the first
</p>
<p>point of attack. The Socialist leaders loudly proclaimed that it had on
</p>
<p>hand over $600,000, the charitable contributions of the world sent to Chi-
</p>
<p>cago after the fire for the benefit of the poor, which sum was held, they
</p>
<p>claimed, for the enrichment of the managers of that society and the benefit
</p>
<p>of "rich paupers." In the early part of December, 1873, a procession of
</p>
<p>the unemployed marched through the streets of the city and demanded
</p>
<p>assistance from the municipal authorities. They finally decided to appeal
</p>
<p>to the Relief Society, and, backed by hundreds in line, a committee
</p>
<p>attempted to wait upon the officials of that organization. They were,
</p>
<p>excluded, however, on the ground that all deserving cases would be aided
</p>
<p>without the intervention of a committee.
</p>
<p>The condition of labor now formed the pretext for many a diatribe
</p>
<p>against capital in general and the alleged favoritism of the Relief and Aid

</p>
<p>Society in particular ; and many allied themselves with the Socialistic
</p>
<p>organization not comprehending its meaning, but because it happened at
</p>
<p>the moment to appeal to their passions.
</p>
<p>It was this state of affairs which spurred on the Socialist leaders to the
</p>
<p>formation of a party. Having accepted the general plan of organization as
</p>
<p>recommended by the committee, another meeting was held in January, 1874.
</p>
<p>A declaration of principles was then formulated. There were nine articles,
</p>
<p>which may be summarized as follows :
</p>
<p>46 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>9
</p>
<p>Abolition of all class legislation and repeal of all existing laws favoring monopolies.
</p>
<p>All means of transportation, such as railroads, canals, telegraph, etc., to be controlled,
</p>
<p>managed and operated by the State.
</p>
<p>Abolition of the prevailing system of letting out public work by contract, the State or
</p>
<p>municipality to have all work of a public nature done under its own supervision and control.
</p>
<p>An amendment to the laws in regard to the recovery of wages, all suits brought for the
</p>
<p>recovery of wages to be decided within eight days.
</p>
<p>The payment of wages by the month to be abolished, and weekly payments substituted.
</p>
<p>A discontinuance of the hiring-out of prison labor to companies or individuals, prisoners
</p>
<p>to be employed by and for the benefit of the State only.
</p>
<p>Adoption by the State of compulsory education of all children between the ages of seven
</p>
<p>and fourteen years ; the hiring-out of children under fourteen to be prohibited.
</p>
<p>All banking, both commercial and savings, to be done by the State.
</p>
<p>All kinds of salary grabs to be discontinued ; all public officers to be paid a fixed salary
</p>
<p>instead of fees.
</p>
<p>Specifically stated, the organization was made to consist of sections and
</p>
<p>divisions and a central committee. Each section was made to consist of
</p>
<p>twenty-five members, and was entitled to one delegate to the conventions of
</p>
<p>the order, with one delegate for every additional one hundred members or
</p>
<p>fraction thereof. The central committee was to be composed of nine members,
</p>
<p>to be chosen by the delegates. The duties of the committee were fixed under
</p>
<p>such rules as might be adopted by the organization. Their term was from
</p>
<p>one general convention to another. Each delegate was allowed as many
</p>
<p>votes as there were members of the section he represented. Delegates from
</p>
<p>each section were obliged to assemble every week to report all party affairs,
</p>
<p>and, if necessary, were expected to make similar reports to the central com-
</p>
<p>mittee. Sections and divisions elected officers for six months. Two-thirds
</p>
<p>of the members of each section were required to be wage-workers. Each
</p>
<p>member had to pay only five cents initiation fee and five cents monthly dues.
</p>
<p>One-half of the income from fees was given to the central committee for
</p>
<p>printing and general expenses. All in arrears for three months, barring
</p>
<p>sickness or want of employment, were expelled. Each section was given
</p>
<p>the power to dismiss such members as acted by word, writing or deed to the

</p>
<p>detriment of the party and its principles. The right of appeal to the cen-
</p>
<p>tral committee was given to any member in case three of his section favored
</p>
<p>it. Monthly reports to sections and quarterly reports to the central com-
</p>
<p>mittee as to the condition of the organization and the treasury were required
</p>
<p>of the secretary. In the event that any officer lost the confidence of his
</p>
<p>section, he could be expelled before the expiration of his term by a majority
</p>
<p>vote.
</p>
<p>Such were the principles and plans of the organization at the outset.
</p>
<p>There does not appear anywhere anything to show that the ulterior object
</p>
<p>of the party was to use violence to enforce its demands. On the contrary,
</p>
<p>at a subsequent general gathering a preamble to the platform expressly
</p>
<p>stated that the party was organized "to advocate and advance the political
</p>
<p>THE "WORKINGMEN'S PARTY." 47
</p>
<p>platform of the Workingmen's Party, to acquire power in legislative bodies
</p>
<p>and to uphold the principles of the platform." Subsequent mass-meetings,
</p>
<p>held in January, ratified the declaration of principles, and the various
</p>
<p>speakers urged that, inasmuch as the " other political parties were for the
</p>
<p>benefit of unprincipled scalawags," their party had come into existence
</p>
<p>"pure and undefiled, to secure to workingmen their rights. " The prime
</p>
<p>movers in the party at this , time were John McAuliff, L. Thorsmark,
</p>
<p>Carl Klings, Henry Stahl, August Arnold, J. Zimple, Leo Meilbeck,
</p>
<p>Prokup Hudek, O. A. Bishop, John Feltes, John Simmens, Jacob Winnen,
</p>
<p>J. Krueger, William Jeffers and Robert Mueller. The organization was
</p>
<p>styled "The Workingmen's Party of Illinois."
</p>
<p>Active agitation at once commenced in various parts of the city. Meet-
</p>
<p>ings were held wherever possible in the poorer sections of the North and
</p>
<p>West Divisions. In all speeches the prevalent distress was dwelt upon and
</p>
<p>the people were urged to combine against capital. Some of the points made
</p>
<p>at these gatherings may be judged from the remarks of the agitators at a
</p>
<p>meeting of the various sections of the party at No. 68 West Lake Street on
</p>
<p>the ist of March, 1874. While the sentiments were somewhat rabid, there
</p>
<p>was no encouragement to deeds of violence. One of the speakers, Mr.
</p>
<p>Zimple, spoke of the object of the meeting as being " to devise means for
</p>
<p>marching on the bulwarks of aristocracy, and gain for the working classes
</p>
<p>that social position to which they were by right entitled. " Then followed
</p>
<p>an invective against capital and society. " All existing things must be torn
</p>
<p>down," he continued, " and a new system of society built up." Slaves even
</p>
<p>were allowed to live, but, as things were then, workingmen, who could work
</p>
<p>no longer, had to starve. If they stood together and elected good men to
</p>
<p>the Legislature next fall, this state of affairs would be changed. Legislators
</p>
<p>were too stupid to make a living by honest work, therefore they had to sub-
</p>
<p>sist by robbing the people. Mr. Thorsmark expressed confidence in the
</p>
<p>success of Socialism and said that if all workingmen would do their duty
</p>
<p>"the present state of society would be reformed, not only for their benefit,
</p>
<p>but for the benefit of mankind." Carl Klings could conceive of "nothing
</p>
<p>more inhuman, cruel and outrageous than the present state of society," and
</p>
<p>it was for this reason, he said, that they had banded together to "strike a

</p>
<p>blow which would effect a change for all time to come." The same tyrants,
</p>
<p>he argued, who had slaughtered their brethren in cold blood and oppressed
</p>
<p>them in France, could be found in Chicago. The workingmen of America
</p>
<p>had not accomplished anything as yet, because they were not yet fully pre-
</p>
<p>pared, but gradually they were becoming a great power, and soon would "no
</p>
<p>longer be compelled to drink the bitter poison from the cup of the aristo-
</p>
<p>crats." Mr. McAuliff touched on the wrongs of the existing state of society
</p>
<p>as he saw it and held that " they all had to unite in one common body and
</p>
<p>seek success at the ballot-box."
</p>
<p>48 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>To gain political power, the Socialists made their first attempt by plac-
</p>
<p>ing a ticket in the field. A convention was held in Thieleman's Theater, in
</p>
<p>the North Division of the city, on the 2gth of March, 1874. Although there
</p>
<p>were general city officers to be elected the following month, the Socialists
</p>
<p>confined their efforts to making nominations only for the town offices of
</p>
<p>North Chicago, in which section their theories seemed, at that time, to have
</p>
<p>found the most fertile soil. Their ticket was made up as follows: Assessor,
</p>
<p>George F. Duffy ; Collector, Philip Koerber ; Supervisor, August Arnold ;
</p>
<p>Town Clerk, Frederick Oest ; Constable, James Jones.
</p>
<p>At this convention an impetus was given to the new organ of the party,
</p>
<p>the Vorbote, which had just issued its initial number, and, although this
</p>
<p>journal was given a considerable circulation to boom the new-fledged can-
</p>
<p>didates, the ticket only polled 950 votes.
</p>
<p>But the leaders were not disheartened. They continued their political
</p>
<p>agitation, and at the approach of the fall campaign they decided to branch
</p>
<p>out more extensively, and to measure swords with the other political parties
</p>
<p>for all the offices in sight. On the 25th of October, 1874, a convention
</p>
<p>was held in Bohemian Turner Hall, on Taylor Street, near Canal, and Con-
</p>
<p>gressional, county and city tickets were put into the field. For Congress
</p>
<p>they selected, for the West Side, W. S. Le Grand ; for the North Side,
</p>
<p>F. A. Hoffman, Jr. It was left an open question whom they should support
</p>
<p>on the South Side. Their candidates for the v Legislature were : Madden,
</p>
<p>Rice, Hudek, Kranel, Thrane and Hymann ; and for the Senate, Rowe,
</p>
<p>Bishop, Methua and Koellner. County Commissioners, Mueller, Bettetil,
</p>
<p>Bley and Maiewsky for the West Side, and German and Breitenstein for
</p>
<p>the North Side. Their candidate for Sheriff was E. Melchior, and for
</p>
<p>Coroner, Dr. Geiger. The aldermanic selections were : In the Second
</p>
<p>Ward, Wasika ; in the Fourth, Tuer j in the Sixth, Grapsicsky ; in the
</p>
<p>Seventh, Maj. Warnecke and E. A. Haller ; in the Eighth, Leonhard ; in
</p>
<p>the Ninth, George Heck ; in the Tenth, Sticker ; in the Eleventh, Uren-
</p>
<p>harst ; in the Twelfth, Zirbes ; in the Fourteenth, Sirks ; in the Fifteenth,
</p>
<p>Schwenn and Anderson ; in the Sixteenth, Seilheimer ; in the Seventeenth,
</p>
<p>H. Jensen ; in the Eighteenth, Frey ; and in the Twentieth, Otto F. Schalz.
</p>
<p>In the wards not given no nominations were made.

</p>
<p>The strength of the ticket may be gathered by the fact that at the elec-
</p>
<p>tion, on November 5th, Melchior received only 378 votes, while his
</p>
<p>opponent, Agnew, Democrat, scored 28,549, and Bradley, Republican,
</p>
<p>21,080. The Socialist candidate who polled the largest number of votes was
</p>
<p>Breitenstein, for County Commissioner 790.
</p>
<p>The leaders now became convinced that a German morning daily was
</p>
<p>necessary to further the interests of their party. The Illinois Staats-Zeitung
</p>
<p>and the Freie Presse had almost neutralized their efforts on the stump, and
</p>
<p>they saw that they must have an organ to meet these papers and reach the
</p>
<p>THE INTERNATIONALE. 49
</p>
<p>masses. They had seen the effects of workingmen's papers in Germany,
</p>
<p>where several representatives had been sent to the Reichstag, and as their
</p>
<p>party shibboleth then was " to secure power in legislative bodies " in Illi-
</p>
<p>nois, they determined to found a paper of their own. On the i3th of De-
</p>
<p>cember, 1874, on Market Street, they held a secret meeting. The leading
</p>
<p>spirits in the proceedings were Mueller, Simmens and Klings. It was pro-
</p>
<p>posed that stock to the amount of $20,000 should be issued for a daily, but as
</p>
<p>no. one seemed to be thoroughly posted in the matter of publishing a paper,
</p>
<p>it was decided to select a committee. Messrs. Klings, Helmerdeg, Sim-
</p>
<p>mens, Methua, Kelting, Winner and Finkensieber were so selected, but
</p>
<p>whether they made any progress, or submitted a report as to their conclu-
</p>
<p>sions, is not known. It is certain that no daily appeared to supplement the
</p>
<p>efforts of their weekly organ at that time, and it was not until four or
</p>
<p>five years later that such a paper finally made its appearance.
</p>
<p>In the winter of 1874 and the spring of 1875 the Socialist agitators were not
</p>
<p>openly aggressive, but they nevertheless kept quietly at work sowing the
</p>
<p>seed of discontent. Finally, in October, 1875, they resumed open and
</p>
<p>active agitation. The only meeting they held that fall was at No. 529 Mil-
</p>
<p>waukee Avenue, and their wrath was directed especially against the Repub-
</p>
<p>lican and Democratic candidates for County. Treasurer. The speakers were
</p>
<p>J. Webeking, John Feltis, Jacob Winnen, A. Zimmerman and John Sim-
</p>
<p>mens. The burden of their harangues was that " the workingmen should
</p>
<p>no longer believe the scoundrels " put up by the other parties. It was time,
</p>
<p>they urged, to " destroy the power of the robber band." Workingmen must
</p>
<p>"organize, place laborers on the throne, and drive capitalists from power."
</p>
<p>In the election, held the following month, they took no active part, and
</p>
<p>this fact, together with the apparently quiescent condition of the organiza-
</p>
<p>tion, prompted the Tribune to remark :
</p>
<p>No longer do they work openly (smarting under former failures), nor do they allow
</p>
<p>outsiders like Oelke, Gruenhut and others to get into their ranks. The Workingmen's Party
</p>
<p>of Illinois, as the Communists of this city style themselves, no longer acts as an independent
</p>
<p>organization, but has placed itself under the protectorate of the society of the International-
</p>
<p>ists, which has branches in every city in the world. The executive committee of this society,
</p>
<p>which formerly resided in Paris and Leipsic, has now its headquarters in New York, and its

</p>
<p>mandates are implicitly complied with by all the local organizations. The central com-
</p>
<p>mittee believe that during the winter large numbers will be without employment, and hence a
</p>
<p>proper time will come to strike a blow. For months they have been organizing military
</p>
<p>companies and maturing plans to burn Chicago and other large cities in the United States
</p>
<p>and the Old World.
</p>
<p>At about this time a secret meeting was held at No. 140 West Lake
</p>
<p>Street. Only members of the local committee of the Internationale and the
</p>
<p>executive committee of the Workingmen's Party were present. It came to
</p>
<p>the surface that other than political measures were discussed. The Socialist
</p>
<p>leaders denied all intention of abandoning politics, but they did not hesitate
</p>
<p>50 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>to avow a belief that some startling blow would facilitate the success of
</p>
<p>their movement. What seemed to give a strong color of truth to reports
</p>
<p>about their incendiary intentions was the action they took with reference to
</p>
<p>Carl Klings. He had been one of the most active spirits in their organiza-
</p>
<p>tion. He was a fiery, impetuous speaker and carried the crowds with him
</p>
<p>in all his harangues. For some unknown reason, not explainable upon any
</p>
<p>other hypothesis than that some violent demonstration was contemplated
</p>
<p>as a change from their past policy, the party had decided to take no hand in
</p>
<p>the election of November, and yet, in spite of this decision, Klings had entered
</p>
<p>into it most bitterly and violently to accomplish the defeat of a candidate
</p>
<p>against whom he cherished the greatest enmity. It would seem that this,
</p>
<p>viewed from a Socialistic standpoint, ought to have commended him to his
</p>
<p>brethren, especially as the candidate was beaten in the election, but, on the
</p>
<p>representation that he had violated an order of the party, Klings was sum-
</p>
<p>marily expelled from the organization on the i3th of December, 1875. The
</p>
<p>fact that he had never secretly advocated violent means undoubtedly accounts
</p>
<p>for his expulsion.
</p>
<p>It is unquestionably true that at this time the Communists were begin-
</p>
<p>ning to think of more serious matters than politics, and gradually drifting
</p>
<p>away from their peaceful mission as avowed in their early party platform
</p>
<p>and public declarations, and it is not unwarranted to attribute their non-
</p>
<p>intervention in politics that fall to the efforts and influence of the Inter-
</p>
<p>nationale. They proved in more ways than one that they had at heart
</p>
<p>revolutionary methods, and that they were only awaiting an opportune
</p>
<p>time to boldly proclaim their sentiments. Even if there could exist a doubt
</p>
<p>on this point, it was dissipated by the utterances of the Socialists at a mass-
</p>
<p>meeting held December 26, 1875, at West Twelfth Street Turner Hall, to
</p>
<p>protest against the treatment of Communist prisoners in New Caledonia by
</p>
<p>the French Government.
</p>
<p>As already stated, the Socialists had established in 1874 an " Inter-
</p>
<p>national Workingmen's Party of the State of Illinois," and for some time
</p>
<p>they held meetings under that pretentious title, principally on Clybourn
</p>
<p>Avenue. The organization struggled along for awhile and finally was lost
</p>
<p>to sight. Subsequently a " Workingmen's Party of the United States "

</p>
<p>appeared in the Socialistic world, and some of the leaders of the old local
</p>
<p>organization began to identify themselves with its establishment and success.
</p>
<p>They held frequent meetings on North Avenue. The declaration of prin-
</p>
<p>ciples of the new party was as follows :
</p>
<p>The emancipation of the working classes must be achieved by the working classes
</p>
<p>themselves, independently of all political parties of the propertied class.
</p>
<p>The struggle for the emancipation of the working classes means not a struggle for class
</p>
<p>privileges and monopolies, but for equal rights and duties, and the abolition of all class
</p>
<p>rule.

<p>SCENES FROM THE RIOTS AT PITTSBURG, 1877.
</p>
<p>52 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>labor, the sources of life, lies at the bottom of servitude in all its forms, of all social misery,
</p>
<p>mental degradation and political dependence.
</p>
<p>The economical emancipation of the working classes is, therefore, the great end to
</p>
<p>which every political movement ought to be subordinate as a means.
</p>
<p>All efforts aiming at that great end have hitherto failed from want of solidarity between
</p>
<p>the manifold divisions of labor in each country, and from the absence of concerted action
</p>
<p>between the workingmen of all countries.
</p>
<p>The emancipation of labor is neither a local nor a national, but a social problem, embrac-
</p>
<p>ing all countries in which modern society exists, and . depending for its solution upon the
</p>
<p>practical and theoretical concurrence and cooperation of the most advanced countries.
</p>
<p>For these reasons the Workingmen's Party of the United States has been founded. It
</p>
<p>enters into proper relations and connections with the workingmen of other countries.
</p>
<p>Whereas, political liberty without economical freedom is but an empty phrase ; therefore,
</p>
<p>we will, in the first place, direct our efforts to the economical question. We repudiate
</p>
<p>entirely connection with all political parties of the propertied class without regard to
</p>
<p>their name. We demand that all the means of labor, land, machinery, railroads, telegraphs,
</p>
<p>canals, etc., become the common property of the whole people, for the purpose of abolishing
</p>
<p>the wage-system, and substituting in its place cooperative production with a just distribution
</p>
<p>of its rewards.
</p>
<p>The political action of the party will be confined generally to obtaining legislative acts in
</p>
<p>the interest of the working class proper. It will not enter into a political campaign before
</p>
<p>being strong enough to exercise a perceptible influence, and then in the first place locally in
</p>
<p>the towns or cities, when demands of purely local character may be presented, provided they
</p>
<p>are not in conflict with the platform and principles of the party. We work for organization
</p>
<p>of the trades-unions upon a national and international basis, to ameliorate the condition of
</p>
<p>the working people and seek to spread therein the above principles. The Workingmen's
</p>
<p>Party of the United States proposes to introduce the following measures as a means to
</p>
<p>improve the condition of the working classes :
</p>
<p>1. Eight hours' work for the present as a normal working day, and legal punishment for
</p>
<p>all violators.
</p>
<p>2. Sanitary inspection of all conditions of labor, means of subsistence and dwellings
</p>
<p>included.
</p>
<p>3. Establishment of bureaus of labor statistics in all States as well as by the National
</p>
<p>Government, the officers of these bureaus to be taken from the ranks of the labor organiza-

<p>tions and elected by them.
</p>
<p>4. Prohibition of the use of prison labor by private employers.
</p>
<p>5. Prohibitory laws against the employment of children under fourteen years of age in
</p>
<p>industrial establishments.
</p>
<p>6. Gratuitous instruction in all educational institutions'.
</p>
<p>7. Strict laws making employers liable for all accidents to the injury of their employes.
</p>
<p>8. Gratuitous administration of justice in courts of law.
</p>
<p>9. Abolition of all conspiracy laws.
</p>
<p>10. Railroads, telegraphs and all means of transportation to be taken hold of and
</p>
<p>operated by the Government.
</p>
<p>11. All industrial enterprises to be placed under the control of the Government as fast as
</p>
<p>practicable and operated by free cooperative trades-unions for the good of the whole
</p>
<p>people.

<p>56 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>The treasurer of the council of administration and the manager shall give security to
</p>
<p>the council of administration in the amount fixed by the Executive Committee. The
</p>
<p>chief editor's salary shall be from $15 to $20 per week. All complaints against the edito-

</p>
<p>The spring of 1876 found the local party in a quiescent state as regards
</p>
<p>active participation in politics, but they did not abandon their meetings.
</p>
<p>The First Regiment of the National Guard at this period had assumed
</p>
<p>goodly proportions, and it naturally came in for a good deal of attention at
</p>
<p>the hands of the speakers. They never failed to denounce it ; but, to cover
</p>
<p>their own sinister designs and lull others to a sense of security, they invari-
</p>
<p>ably declared that the Communists intended no war. They continued their
</p>
<p>"vacant-lot" oratory and in every way sought to increase the number of
</p>
<p>their party adherents.
</p>
<p>Toward the end of July, 1876, a Union Congress was held in Philadel-
</p>
<p>phia, and these new declarations of principles were formulated :
</p>
<p>The Union Congress of the Workingmen's Party of the United States declares : The
</p>
<p>emancipation of labor is a social problem concerning the whole human race and embracing
</p>
<p>all sexes. The emancipation of women will be accomplished with the emancipation of men,
</p>
<p>and the so-called woman's rights question will be solved with the labor question. All evils
</p>
<p>and wrongs of the present society can be abolished only when economical freedom is gained
</p>
<p>for men as well as for women. It is the duty, therefore, of the wives and daughters of the
</p>
<p>workingmen to organize themselves and take their places within the ranks of struggling labor.
</p>
<p>To aid and support them in this work is the duty of men. By uniting their efforts they will
</p>
<p>succeed in breaking the economical fetters, and a new and free race of men and women will
</p>
<p>arise, recognizing each other as peers. We acknowledge the perfect equality of rights of both
</p>
<p>sexes, and in the Workingmen's Party of the United States this equality of rights is a prin-
</p>
<p>ciple and is strictly observed.
</p>

</p>
<p>the great end, to which every political movement ought to be subordinate as a means ; con-

</p>
<p>sidering that the Workingmen's Party of the United States in the first place directs its efforts
</p>
<p>to the economical struggle ; considering that only in the economical arena the combatants for
</p>
<p>the Workingmen's Party can be trained and disciplined ; considering that in this country the
</p>
<p>ballot-box has long ago ceased to record the popular will, and only serves to falsify the same
</p>
<p>in the hands of professional politicians ; considering that the organization of the working
</p>
<p>people is not yet far enough developed to overthrow at once this state of corruption ; con-
</p>
<p>sidering that this middle class republic has produced an enormous amount of small reformers
</p>
<p>and quacks, the intruding of whom will only be facilitated by a political movement of the
</p>
<p>Workingmen's Party of the United States and considering that the corruption and misappli-
</p>
<p>cation of the ballot-box, as well as the silly reform movements, flourish most in years of Presi-
</p>
<p>dential elections, at such times greatly endangering the organization of workingmen : For
</p>
<p>these reasons the Union Congress, meeting at Philadelphia in July, 1876, resolves:
</p>
<p>The sections of this party as well as all workingmen in general are earnestly invited to
</p>
<p>abstain from all political movements for the present and to turn their back on the ballot-box.
</p>
<p>The workingmen will thus save themselves bitter disappointments, and their time and efforts

</p>
<p>per week for two weeks more. It is resolved to levy an extraordinary tax of ten cents per
</p>
<p>member, and to continue said extraordinary tax every three months until all liabilities of the
</p>
<p>party shall be paid. All sections are invited to hold festivities in honor of the Union, now
</p>
<p>accomplished, and to devote the proceeds of these festivities to aid the press of the party and
</p>
<p>to pay the extraordinary taxes.
</p>
<p>It was further resolved that "no local paper shall be founded without
</p>
<p>the consent of the Executive Committee and the Board of Supervision." It

</p>
<p>was resolved to place the agencies of all foreign publications in the hands
</p>
<p>of the party. After having come to an understanding with the various
</p>
<p>publishers of labor papers in other countries, a central depot was to be
</p>
<p>established. The two councils of administration of the party organs in
</p>
<p>New York were charged with making the necessary preparations for open-
</p>
<p>ing the central depot on the first day of October in New York. It was also
</p>
<p>recommended to the party authorities to publish labor pamphlets adapted
</p>
<p>to the conditions of this country.
</p>
<p>Decisions of the Executive Committee. In order to insure the collection of the extra tax
</p>
<p>of ten cents per quarter, levied by the Congress, the moneys sent in for dues will be credited
</p>
<p>to the extra tax account for the preceding quarter year, should such delinquencies occur.
</p>
<p>Any section in arrears for three months will be notified, and if within one month thereafter
</p>
<p>the section has not restored its good standing, it will be declared defunct. Where sections
</p>
<p>cannot appoint their own newspaper agent from among the members, they may appoint any
</p>
<p>person as their agent, but such agent must be personally responsible. Where sections fail

</p>
<p>to report gain or loss of members, they will be charged for dues and extra tax, according to
</p>
<p>the number of members enrolled at the last report. Every section shall be judge of its own
</p>
<p>members, but no expulsion from the whole party can be effected except as provided for by
</p>
<p>the constitution. No person can be a member of two sections at the same time.
</p>
<p>Amendments to the Constitution. Paragraph 3, division 4, under "Sections." First amend-
</p>
<p>ment, adopted December i6th by a general election : In addition to one section (composed
</p>
<p>of men of each language of any locality) there may also be organized one section of women
</p>
<p>under the same regulations as the others. Second amendment, adopted July 15: Article i,
</p>
<p>paragraph 4, is amended to read : "For the Congress to be held in the year 1887, the ex-
</p>
<p>penses of each delegate will be borne by the section or sections represented by him."
</p>
<p>During the winter of 1876 the excitement on the possible outcome of the
</p>
<p>national election prostrated business throughout the country. There were
</p>
<p>even rumors and threats of bloody conflict. Capital naturally hesitated, and
</p>
<p>investments were confined to projects in which there was no element of
</p>
<p>chance and for which the returns were measurably certain. The Socialists
</p>
<p>of Chicago sought in every possible way to make the most of the situation
</p>
<p>by inflaming the minds of the unemployed against capital, and labored to
</p>
<p>secure proselytes by urging that such a state of affairs could never exist
</p>
<p>under Socialism. Meetings were held wherever either a hall or a vacant lot
</p>
<p>could be secured. A. R. Parsons, Philip Van Patten, George A. Schil-
</p>
<p>ling, T. J. Morgan and Ben Sibley, who had hitherto figured only before
</p>
<p>small street crowds, now became prominent as. speakers at large gatherings,
</p>
<p>and their harangues proved that they were apt students in the Socialistic
</p>
<p>school, and ready expounders of the proposed new social system.
</p>
<p>The Legislature of Illinois was in session at the time under review, and
</p>
<p>in March, 1877, the Socialist leaders entered into a discussion of the neces-
</p>
<p>sity of forcing that body to pass the bills then pending before it with refer-
</p>
<p>ence to the establishment of a bureau of statistics on wages and earnings,
</p>
<p>cost and manner of living, fatal accidents in each branch of labor and their
</p>
<p>causes, cooperation, hours of labor, etc., and for the collection of wages.
</p>
<p>They urged that the laboring classes should demand these measures and in-
</p>
<p>sisted that the "boss classes, the capitalistic classes, the aristocrats, who
</p>
<p>lived in riot and luxury on the fruit which labor had tilled and ought to en-
</p>
<p>joy," should not stand in the way of their passage. Time and again they

</p>
<p>rang the various changes on the "iniquity and inequalities of the present
</p>
<p>social system," and fairly howled themselves hoarse in declaring that " the
</p>
<p>Labor party was organized not only to destroy that system, but to secure a
</p>
<p>division of property, which Socialism demanded and was determined to
</p>
<p>have."
</p>
<p>Early in July, 1877, the firemen and brakemen of the Baltimore and
</p>
<p>Ohio Railroad began a strike at Baltimore against a reduction of wages.
</p>
<p>This strike soon reached Martinsburg, W. Va., and caused an immense
</p>
<p>blockade of freight traffic. The strikers finally grew so riotous that the
</p>
<p>local authorities were powerless, and President Hayes, being appealed to by
</p>
<p>60 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>the Governor of Maryland, issued a proclamation. United States troops
</p>
<p>were at the same time dispatched from Washington and Fort McHenry to
</p>
<p>the scene of disturbances, and order was finally brought out of chaos.
</p>
<p>Following close upon the heels of this strike came one on the Pennsyl-
</p>
<p>vania Railroad at Pittsburg, against an order doubling up trains and thus
</p>
<p>dispensing with a large number of employes. The railroad people, in
</p>
<p>explanation of their action, showed that during June preceding not only had
</p>
<p>there been a great depreciation of railroad stocks, but a shrinkage in the
</p>
<p>value of railroad property from 20 to 70 per cent., caused by a great falling-
</p>
<p>off in business. It is needless for the purpose of this chapter to recount
</p>
<p>the wild scenes of riot and bloodshed that ensued at Pittsburg, when troops
</p>
<p>numbering two thousand, sent from Philadelphia, engaged in deadly con-
</p>
<p>flict with the unbridled mob and when millions of dollars' worth of property
</p>
<p>was destroyed by the incendiary torch.
</p>
<p>While this carnival of fire, death and bloodshed still startled the world,
</p>
<p>a strike broke out in Chicago among railroad men. While the strikers
</p>
<p>here sought to contend in an orderly manner against their employers, the
</p>
<p>same element which had inspired and carried out deeds of violence in the
</p>
<p>East the Communists were not slow to seize upon the opportunity in
</p>
<p>Chicago to .widen the breach between capital and labor. Threats and riot-
</p>
<p>ous demonstrations were their weapons. They virtually took possession of
</p>
<p>all the large manufacturing establishments in the city, and by intimidation
</p>
<p>and force compelled men willing to work and satisfied with their wages to
</p>
<p>join their howling mobs. Not alone did they succeed in stopping freight
</p>
<p>traffic, but they clogged the wheels of industry in the principal factories and
</p>
<p>shops of the city. The leaders were active during the day directing the
</p>
<p>riotous movements of their followers, and at night they assembled to devise
</p>
<p>methods to increase the general turmeil. Their headquarters were at No.
</p>
<p>131 Milwaukee Avenue, and here all-night sessions were sometimes held.
</p>
<p>Proclamations were frequently sent out to workingmen, urging them to
</p>
<p>stand firmly in defense of their rights.
</p>
<p>The leading spirits at this time were Philip Van Patten, now of Cincin-
</p>
<p>nati, J. H. White, J. Paulsen and Charles Erickson, who constituted the
</p>
<p>executive committee of the Workingmen's Party, and A. R. Parsons and

<p>George Schilling.
</p>
<p>Some of the meetings referred to were quite stormy in character.
</p>
<p>Threats were made to "clean out" the police, and some speakers advised
</p>
<p>attacks on the guardians of the peace with stones, bricks and revolvers. The
</p>
<p>leaders were too cautious, however, to advise anything of the kind in their
</p>
<p>public declarations. Violence was reserved for the mobs on the inspiration
</p>
<p>of the moment, or at the instigation of trusted adherents at the proper time.
</p>
<p>That such were their intentions is apparent from a statement of one of
</p>
<p>the members, who said :
</p>
<p>THE RIOTS OF 1877. 61
</p>
<p>"To-morrow Chicago will see a big day, and no one can predict what
</p>
<p>will be the end of this contest."
</p>
<p>Sure enough, on the day following the 25th of July a conflict
</p>
<p>ensued between the police and strong mobs at the Halsted Street Viaduct
</p>
<p>and elsewhere, in which several of the rioters were injured. On the day
</p>
<p>following, the riots reached their culminating point, and between the
</p>
<p>police, infantry and cavalry the Communistic element were driven to their
</p>
<p>holes with many killed and wounded. That effectually terminated the
</p>
<p>reign of riot, and the city resumed its normal condition. The trouble in
</p>
<p>the East also subsided about the same time.
</p>
<p>The Communists, after this severe lesson, remained dormant for some
</p>
<p>months. Evidently they saw that the time had not arrived for the com-
</p>
<p>mencement of that revolution which they had at heart. In the fall of 1877
</p>
<p>they seem to have reached the conclusion that they would exchange the art
</p>
<p>of war for arts political. Accordingly, in October they were again to be
</p>
<p>found on the campaign stump for the first time since 1874. There were
</p>
<p>then four parties in the field, Democrats, Republicans, Industrials and
</p>
<p>Greenbackers, and this situation may have suggested a chance for the suc-
</p>
<p>cess of their ticket or an opportunity to secure concessions from the dom-
</p>
<p>inant parties that would result to their advantage. C. J. Dixon was then
</p>
<p>chairman of the "Industrial Party." This party claimed to seek redress
</p>
<p>for the grievances of workingmen without resorting to destruction of society
</p>
<p>or government, and if it had denied affiliation with the Socialists it might
</p>
<p>have become a factor in politics. It may be stated that for a time after the
</p>
<p>election Dixon held to his principles, but, a few years Tater became a repre-
</p>
<p>sentative in the Legislature of the Communistic element.
</p>
<p>The outcome of the political agitation of the Socialists that fall was the
</p>
<p>nomination of the following ticket : For County Treasurer, Frank A. Stau-
</p>
<p>ber ; County Clerk, A. R. Parsons ; Probate Clerk, Philip Van Patten ;
</p>
<p>Clerk of the Criminal Court, Tim O'Meara; Superintendent of Schools,
</p>
<p>John McAuliff ; County Commissioners, W. A. Barr, Samuel Goldwater,
</p>
<p>T. J. Morgan, Max Nisler and L. Thorsmark. For Judge, John A. Jameson,
</p>
<p>then on the bench, was indorsed, and Julius Rosenthal not a Socialist
</p>
<p>was nominated for Judge of the Probate Court. The election held on the

</p>
<p>8th of November showed some gains for the party. Omitting the "Indus-
</p>
<p>trials" which were swallowed up by the other parties in the way of "elec-
</p>
<p>tion trades," the Socialists secured a vote of 6,592 in the contest for the
</p>
<p>County Treasurership, while McCrea, Republican, polled a vote of 22,423 ;
</p>
<p>Lynch, Democrat, 18,388, and Hammond, Greenbacker, 769.
</p>
<p>In 1878 a session of the Congress was again held, and then it was decided
</p>
<p>to change the name of the " Workingmen's Party of the United States " to
</p>
<p>the "Socialistic Labor Party," and it was also resolved to "use the ballot-
</p>
<p>box as a means for the elevation of working people" and for "electing men
</p>
<p>62 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>from their own ranks to the halls of legislation and to the municipal govern-
</p>
<p>ment."
</p>
<p>The different wards of Chicago were subsequently organized into ward
</p>
<p>clubs, each with a captain and secretary as permanent officers for a year.
</p>
<p>It was made the duty of the captain of a ward to find halls for public meet-
</p>
<p>ings and to report to the central committee. He was to open the meetings
</p>
<p>in his ward and see that a chairman was chosen from among those attend-
</p>
<p>ing. The duty of. the secretary was to issue cards of membership to new
</p>
<p>members, to collect monthly dues of ten cents from each member, and to
</p>
<p>receipt for the same on the back of the cards ; he was also to keep minutes
</p>
<p>of the meetings and have them published in the party papers. The captain
</p>
<p>was authorized to appoint a precinct captain for every precinct in his ward,
</p>
<p>whose duty it was to control the distribution of tickets at elections. The
</p>
<p>precinct captain was also directed to appoint lieutenants in his precinct,
</p>
<p>one for each block if possible, to assist him in the work of agitation and the
</p>
<p>distribution of tickets.
</p>
<p>Under the plans formulated by the Socialistic Congress a central commit-
</p>
<p>tee was again organized in the city of Chicago. It was composed of a
</p>
<p>chairman, a secretary and a treasurer, who were elected by a joint meeting
</p>
<p>of the different sections every six mqpths. In 1878 there were four sections
</p>
<p>in Chicago one German, one English, one French and one Scandinavian.
</p>
<p>The German section had the largest number of members, between three
</p>
<p>and four hundred, and was steadily gaining. The English section num-
</p>
<p>bered only about one hundred and fifty. The Scandinavian branch had
</p>
<p>about an equal number. The French only mustered fifty members. Dur-
</p>
<p>ing a campaign the ward captains were made members of the central
</p>
<p>committee. They were charged with the duty of reporting the progress of
</p>
<p>the ward clubs, notifying the committee where halls had been rented and
</p>
<p>indicating what speakers were needed. It was the duty of the central
</p>
<p>committee to advertise all club meetings, pay for the halls rented when the
</p>
<p>clubs could not pay, and settle all bills and expenses incident to an election.
</p>
<p>The committee was the only body authorized to order the printing of tickets,
</p>
<p>and for all their acts they were held responsible to the "Socialistic Labor
</p>
<p>Party." The money needed to defray expenses was raised mostly through

</p>
<p>subscriptions and collections in the various clubs. The meetings of the
</p>
<p>committee were conducted openly. Representatives of the press were per-
</p>
<p>mitted to be present if at any prior meeting they had not purposely dis-
</p>
<p>torted the proceedings. During the years 1878 and 1879 the meetings of
</p>
<p>the committee were generally held in a hall on the second floor of No. 7
</p>
<p>South Clark Street.
</p>
<p>With an organization thus perfected under the plan of the Socialistic
</p>
<p>Congress, the Socialists felt themselves in condition to cope with the other
</p>
<p>parties. They saw in the vote of 1877 a chance for seating some of their

<p>members in the City Council, and set out to talk politics at all their gather-
</p>
<p>ings for the spring of 1878. On the I5th of March of that year they held a
</p>
<p>convention at No. 45 North Clark Street, and put up a ticket for Aldermen
</p>
<p>in all the wards except the Eleventh and Eighteenth, and for the various
</p>
<p>town offices in the three divisions of Chicago. Inasmuch as the "old
</p>
<p>timber" was worked over for these various offices, it is needless to repeat
</p>
<p>names. Their platform reiterated the demands made in the first declaration
</p>
<p>of principles, and, in addition, asked for the establishment of public baths
</p>
<p>in each division of the city ; extension of the school system ; annulment of
</p>
<p>the gas and street-car companies' charters, the same to be operated by the
</p>
<p>city after payment to the owners of principal and interest on moneys actually
</p>
<p>invested, out of the profits ; prompt payment of taxes, and employment for
</p>
<p>all residents of the city that needed it.
</p>
<p>During the campaign incident to the election, Paul Grottkau, then a
</p>
<p>recent arrival from Berlin, proved a conspicuous figure and made a number
</p>
<p>of stirring appeals. He expounded the principles of Socialism and inva r i-
</p>
<p>ably wound up by characterizing the members of the Democratic an<A
</p>
<p>Republican parties as "liars and horse-thieves." Through his Active par-
</p>
<p>ticipation in the Socialistic movement in Chicago Grottkau became editor of
</p>
<p>the Arbeiter-Zeitung, but, fortunately for himself, was displaced in 1880 by
</p>
<p>August Spies.
</p>
<p>The election of April, 1878, resulted in placing one member in the City
</p>
<p>Council Stauber, from the Fourteenth Ward.
</p>
<p>This was the first political victory the Socialists had achieved in the city,
</p>
<p>and, having noticed a small but steady increase in their voting force, they
</p>
<p>proceeded to organize and agitate more diligently than ever before in a
</p>
<p>political way. Meanwhile they saw the growing strength of the State
</p>
<p>militia, and as an offset to the organization of the various military com-
</p>
<p>panies in Chicago they determined to raise and equip companies from
</p>
<p>their own ranks. They had begun in a quiet way to start the nucleus of
</p>
<p>military companies some time after the First Regiment had been organized,
</p>
<p>but it was not until 1878 that it became generally known that they had men
</p>
<p>armed and drilled in military tactics, to be marshaled against society upon
</p>
<p>a favorable opportunity. In the early part of 1878 the very flower and

<p>strength of their military was the Lehr und Wehr Verein, composed of
</p>
<p>picked men and veterans who had been baptized with fire on European
</p>
<p>battlefields. Its strength was variously estimated at from four to six
</p>
<p>thousand, but it never exceeded four hundred members. The "Jaeger
</p>
<p>Verein," the "Bohemian Sharpshooters" and the "Labor Guard of ths
</p>
<p>Fifth Ward," each with no more than fifty members, were auxiliary organ-
</p>
<p>izations and composed mainly of raw recruits. Their instruction in the
</p>
<p>manual of arms was mainly given by Major Presser, a trained and skilled
</p>
<p>European tactician.
</p>
<p>SOCIALISTIC NEWSPAPERS. 65
</p>
<p>Meantime the party had been greatly strengthened by the aid of news-
</p>
<p>papers printed in its interest. In 1874, Die Volks-Zeitung\&& been started
</p>
<p>by a stock company called the Social-Democratic Printing Association.
</p>
<p>This paper was published at No. 94 South Market Street, with Mr. Brucker
</p>
<p>as editor. Shortly thereafter, the Vorbote, a weekly paper, was started
</p>
<p>under the auspices of the Workingmen's Party at the same number. C.
</p>
<p>Conzett, formerly a resident of Berne, Switzerland, became its editor. He
</p>
<p>subsequently bought out the Volks-Zeitung and thereafter published a tri-
</p>
<p>weekly paper under the name of the Arbeiter-Zeitung, which became a
</p>
<p>private enterprise in the interest of workingmen. His assistant editor was
</p>
<p>Gustav Leiser. They made the paper an advocate of revolutionary
</p>
<p>methods and urged the organization of trades-unions. They encouraged
</p>
<p>strikes and held that only through such means could workingmen secure
</p>
<p>their rights. They published without charge all grievances of laboring
</p>
<p>men on the score of non-payment of wages and abuses of manufacturing
</p>
<p>concerns, but each article had the full name of the writer. At first the
</p>
<p>editors did not favor a resort to the ballot-box to remedy grievances. It
</p>
<p>was not until after the great railroad strike of July, 1877, that they advo-
</p>
<p>cated an organized fight in elections independently of the old parties. The
</p>
<p>workingmen, they urged, must elect men of their own in order to secure
</p>
<p>favorable legislation.
</p>
<p>I ( n 1878 an English weekly called the Socialist was started under the
</p>
<p>auspices of the main section of the Socialistic Labor Party of Chicago.
</p>
<p>This main section was composed of the German, English, Scandinavian
</p>
<p>and French sections, and they employed Frank Hirth as editor at a salary
</p>
<p>of $15 per week and A. R. Parsons as assistant at a salary of $12 per week.
</p>
<p>This paper was made the organ in the English language of the Socialistic
</p>
<p>Labor Party, and, while it made some headway at the start, it succumbed
</p>
<p>within a year, owing to jealousies and differences of opinion between the
</p>
<p>German and English sections.
</p>
<p>About the time the Socialist was established another paper was put in
</p>
<p>the field by the Scandinavian section. It was called Den Nye Tid, and was
</p>
<p>edited by Mr. Peterson.
</p>
<p>In 1878 the proprietor of the Arbeiter-Zeitung signified a willingness to

<p>sell his paper to the Socialistic Labor Party, and, in o^der to consummate
</p>
<p>the transfer, the main section held a meeting in May of that year at Stein-
</p>
<p>mueller's Hall, No. 45 North Clark Street. Plans were then and there ma-
</p>
<p>tured for its purchase. It was decided to borrow the money and issue notes
</p>
<p>at 6 per cent, interest, payable as soon as the treasury had secured enough
</p>
<p>from collections and other sources to take them up. Collectors were
</p>
<p>appointed for each division of the city, and they were directed to collect
</p>
<p>money from workingmen and storekeepers. On the evening of June 29,
</p>
<p>1878, a meeting was held at No. 7 South Clark Street, and the reports
</p>
<p>66 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>showed that enough money had been raised to purchase the Arbeiter-Zeitung.
</p>
<p>Subsequently a general meeting was held and a society was organized called
</p>
<p>the " Socialistische Druckgesellschaft." A board of trustees was chosen,
</p>
<p>and they applied to the Secretary of State for a charter. That official
</p>
<p>declined to issue the charter because the name of the society was in German.
</p>
<p>Another meeting was held at No. 54 West Lake Street, and the name was
</p>
<p>changed to the "Socialistic Publishing Company," after which the charter
</p>
<p>was readily secured. The paper was then transferred by Herr Conzett to the
</p>
<p>new company, and subsequently the managers added a Sunday edition called
</p>
<p>Die Fackel. Paul Grottkau, formerly editor of the Berlin Freie Presse, was
</p>
<p>appointed editor under the new management at a salary of $15 per week,
</p>
<p>and F. J. Pfeiffer, of Chicago, was made assistant editor. The society
</p>
<p>which now had charge of the paper was composed of bona fide members
</p>
<p>of the German section. Their meetings were conducted in the same
</p>
<p>manner as those of the Socialistic Labor Party. The price of the Arbeiter-
</p>
<p>Zeitung was reduced, and all money realized from its sale over and above
</p>
<p>expenses was applied for purposes of agitation. While the paper was
</p>
<p>reported in a prospering condition, it was decided to take steps to pay off
</p>
<p>its indebtednes as represented by the outstanding notes, and to this end a
</p>
<p>grand festival was to be held, the proceeds of which should be devoted to
</p>
<p>the press fund. Some trouble was experienced in getting a hall large
</p>
<p>enough for the purpose. The Exposition Building was finally decided upon,
</p>
<p>and it was secured without much delay, with results as noted further along
</p>
<p>in this chapter.
</p>
<p>Soon after the Socialist had expired, the members of the Workingmen's
</p>
<p>Party felt the need of an English organ, and, having meanwhile come to a
</p>
<p>better understanding, they decided that they would make another effort to
</p>
<p>put one before the people. The result of several conferences was a monster
</p>
<p>picnic at Wright's Grove on the i6th of June, 1878. The procession formed
</p>
<p>to make the occasion imposing numbered about three thousand, and side by
</p>
<p>side with the American flag was borne the red banner of Anarchy. This
</p>
<p>emblem, although it finally crowded out the "stars and stripes," had
</p>
<p>hitherto been reserved in public demonstrations for a minor place. Some of
</p>
<p>the mottoes displayed on this occasion ran as follows : " No Rich, no Poor

</p>
<p>All Alike." "No Monopolies All for One and One for All. " " Land belongs
</p>
<p>to Society," and "No Masters, no Slaves."
</p>
<p>The result of the picnic was that the Alarm was established, and A. R.
</p>
<p>Parsons became its editor on a weekly allowance of $5, subsequently raised
</p>
<p>to $8.
</p>
<p>In the fall campaign of 1878 we find the Socialists again in the field with
</p>
<p>a full ticket for Congressmen, the Legislature and local offices. Former
</p>
<p>party platforms were reaffirmed, and mass-meetings to fire the hearts of
</p>
<p>workingmen were frequently held. At these gatherings capitalists were
</p>
<p>THE ELECTION OF 1878.
</p>
<p>DR. CARL EDUARD NOBILING.
</p>
<p>denounced as usual, and the police came in for some attention. The cam-
</p>
<p>paign song was also introduced, and the chorus of one, rendered by an
</p>
<p>untamed troubadour named W. B. Creech, and referring to the police, ran
</p>
<p>after this style, to the air of " Peeler and Goat " :
</p>
<p>Then raise your voices, workingmen,
</p>
<p>Against such cowardly hirelings, O !
</p>
<p>Go to the polls and slaughter them
</p>
<p>With ballots, instead of bullets, O !
</p>
<p>One Dr. Mclntosh could always be de-
</p>
<p>pended on for grinding out any quantity of
</p>
<p>doggerel of this kind for any occasion.
</p>
<p>The Socialists claimed that they
</p>
<p>would poll on the day of election
</p>
<p>Nov. 5th from 9,000 to 13,000 votes.
</p>
<p>Their calculations, like their utter-
</p>
<p>ances, were wild and wide of the
</p>
<p>mark, however, as their candidate for
</p>
<p>Sheriff, Ryan, only secured 5,980
</p>
<p>votes, while Hoffman, Republican,
</p>
<p>had 16,592 ; Kern, Democrat, 16,586,
</p>
<p>and Dixon, Greenbacker, 4,491. They
</p>
<p>secured, however, a member of the State Senate, Sylvester Artley, and three
</p>
<p>members of the lower house of the Legislature Leo Meilbeck, Charles,
</p>
<p>Ehrhardt and Christian Meier. This gave them great confidence, and they
</p>
<p>pushed with greater vigor than ever their
</p>
<p>political work. Meetings were kept up
</p>
<p>throughout the winter, and, among other
</p>
<p>things, they discussed measures which they
</p>
<p>demanded from the Legislature in the in-
</p>
<p>terest of labor. These demands included
</p>
<p>reducing the hours of labor; the establish-
</p>
<p>ment of a bureau of labor statistics ; abolish-
</p>
<p>ment of convict labor ; sanitary inspection

<p>of food, dwellings, factories, work-shops and
</p>
<p>mines ; abolition of child labor ; liability of
</p>
<p>employers for all accidents to employes
</p>
<p>through the employers' neglect, and prior-
</p>
<p>ity of demands for wages over all other
</p>
<p>claims. They found time also to give their
</p>
<p>attention to their brethren in Europe, and
</p>
<p>at a meeting held Sunday, January 19,
</p>
<p>1879, they adopted resolutions denouncing
</p>
<p>Bismarck for persecutions of workingmen in MAX HOEDEL
</p>
<p>68 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>Germany. The pretext for these persecutions, they claimed, grew out of
</p>
<p>the attempts on the life of Emperor William by Hoedel and Dr. Nobiling.
</p>
<p>The would-be assassins, they confessed, had once been Socialists, but at the
</p>
<p>time of the attack had had nothing in common with the order. Hoedel,
</p>
<p>they said, had been expelled, and had subsequently joined the " Christian
</p>
<p>Socialistic Party," which they asserted had the favor of the Government,
</p>
<p>and at the head of which was a Government official. They claimed
</p>
<p>that Hoedel had been instigated to the deed by the German court, and
</p>
<p>they even doubted that he had been beheaded in expiation of his
</p>
<p>crime. Hoedel, they said, had been simply an instrument in the hands of
</p>
<p>Bismarck, who wanted a pretext to persecute the Socialists and secure the
</p>
<p>passage of a bill in the Reichstag for their suppression. Under the provis-
</p>
<p>ions of that bill, they asserted, men, women and children were thrown into
</p>
<p>dungeons without trial, and they insisted that the Congress of the United
</p>
<p>States should voice their protest against such persecutions.
</p>
<p>At nearly every large meeting held during the winter in question, Creech
</p>
<p>was to the front with new songs, among one the chorus of which ran thus :
</p>
<p>Raise aloft the crimson banner, emblem of the free ;
</p>
<p>Mighty tyrants now are trembling, here and o'er the sea.
</p>
<p>On the evening of March 22, 1879, they held the celebration in the Expo-
</p>
<p>sition Building already referred to. This was ostensibly in commemora-
</p>
<p>tion of the establishment of the Paris Commune in 1848 and again in 1871.
</p>
<p>The real purpose, however, was to obtain funds to defray the expenses
</p>
<p>incident to the coming spring campaign and to aid in making a daily out of
</p>
<p>their tri- weekly organ, the Arbeiter-Zeitung. There were from 20,000 to
</p>
<p>25,000 people in the building, and the amount reported realized reached
</p>
<p>$4,500. There was speech-making by Dr. Ernst Schmidt, A. R. Parsons,
</p>
<p>Paul Grottkau, and lesser lights, and the various military companies of the
</p>
<p>organization strutted about in their uniforms, with belts, cartridge-boxes,
</p>
<p>bayonet scabbards and breech-loading Remingtons.
</p>
<p>With part of the proceeds of this celebration, the Socialists fitted up
</p>
<p>campaign headquarters in a top-story room on the northeast corner of
</p>
<p>Madison and La Salle Streets, in the very heart of the business center.
</p>

<p>70 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>With the inauguration of Carter Harrison's administration, a good deal
</p>
<p>of attention was given to the Socialists by him as well as by his Democratic
</p>
<p>co-laborers. Some of their men were given employment in the departments
</p>
<p>of the city. Although they still continued their agitation, these appoint-
</p>
<p>ments and other favors had the effect of undermining their political
</p>
<p>strength.
</p>
<p>In the next Mayoralty election they made a show of keeping up their
</p>
<p>organization and nominated George Schilling for Mayor and Frank Stauber
</p>
<p>for City Treasurer. But in the election held April 5th, 1881, the former only
</p>
<p>polled 240 votes, and Stauber 1,999, thus demonstrating an almost complete
</p>
<p>collapse of the party.
</p>
<p>This virtually took them out of politics. Thenceforward the Socialists
</p>
<p>^_________^_^_^___^__ seem to have decided to abandon the
</p>
<p>ballot-box, and to rely on force only for
</p>
<p>the attainment of their objects. Accord-
</p>
<p>ingly their harangues were directed to
</p>
<p>the dissemination of the doctrines of
</p>
<p>revolution. They endeavored still, it is
</p>
<p>true, to maintain a representation in the
</p>
<p>City Council, but in 1884 the Socialistic
</p>
<p>element was entirely eliminated from
</p>
<p>that body.
</p>
<p>At the session of the Congress of
</p>
<p>the International Workingmen's Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation held at Pittsburg from the i4th
</p>
<p>to the 1 6th of October, 1883, there was
</p>
<p>a- large delegation of Chicago Anarch-
</p>
<p>ists. A question arose as to the use of
</p>
<p>the ballot for remedying the wrongs of
</p>
<p>the laboring people. The delegates
</p>
<p>CARTER H. HARRISON. , TD u- <- J 4.1,
</p>
<p>from Baltimore insisted that recourse
</p>
<p>should be had to the ballot-box, but those from Pittsburg were of another
</p>
<p>mind, and favored something stronger. This suggestion gave the Anarch-

</p>
<p>ist contingent from Chicago an opportunity to come to the front, and, while
</p>
<p>some of these did not hold to extreme measures, they all agreed that the
</p>
<p>ballot-box only served to keep capitalistic representatives in office. The
</p>
<p>radical Chicago element went still further, holding that the theory of
</p>
<p>Karl Marx, the use of force, was the correct one, and that that force should
</p>
<p>be dynamite. But here a split occurred in their own delegation, the milder
</p>
<p>ones holding to the theory of Lassalle, that they should first give the
</p>
<p>ballot a thorough trial and use force only in the event of failure. The sen-
</p>
<p>timent of the convention predominated in favor of force, and the conserva-
</p>
<p>tive Anarchists ceased to be members.
</p>
<p>THE PITTSBURG CONGRESS. 71
</p>
<p>The controversy thus begun was carried back to Chicago, and the radi-
</p>
<p>cals set themselves strenuously to work to bring their disaffected associates
</p>
<p>to the advocacy of dynamite. The members of the Lehr und Wehr Verein
</p>
<p>were particularly opposed to the use of the bomb. They had equipped
</p>
<p>themselves and drilled in the use of guns so as to be able to meet the police
</p>
<p>and militia after failure at the polls, and they contended that men carrying
</p>
<p>bombs would be apt, through lack of experience, to hurt themselves as much
</p>
<p>as their opponents. Men thoroughly drilled in the handling of a gun, they
</p>
<p>argued, could accomplish something, and to that end every one should be
</p>
<p>instructed in military tactics. The radicals of the various "groups" did
</p>
<p>not believe in guns, however, and held that, inasmuch as they had experi-
</p>
<p>mented with dynamite with some success, they should adopt it as a means of
</p>
<p>warfare. They finally brought all to their ideas, and from that time to the
</p>
<p>present they have given the subject of dynamite and explosives a great
</p>
<p>deal of study.
</p>
<p>As indicating the sense of the Pittsburg Congress their plan of organiza-
</p>
<p>tion and resolutions are here given:
</p>
<p>The name of the organization shall be " International Workingmen's Association."
</p>
<p>1. The organization shall consist of federal groups which recognize the principles laid
</p>
<p>down in the manifesto and consider themselves bound by them.
</p>
<p>2. Five persons shall have the right to form a group.
</p>
<p>3. Each group shall have complete independence (autonomy) and shall further have the
</p>
<p>right to conduct the propaganda in accordance with its own judgment, but the same must
</p>
<p>not collide with the fundamental principles of the organization.
</p>
<p>4. Each group may call itself by the name of its location. When there is more than one
</p>
<p>group, they shall be numbered.
</p>
<p>5. In places where there is more than one group it is recommended that a general com-
</p>
<p>mittee be formed to secure united action. Such committees shall, however, have no execu-
</p>
<p>tive power.
</p>
<p>6. A Bureau of Information shall be created at Chicago and shall consist of a secretary
</p>
<p>of each of the groups of different languages. It is the duty of such bureau to keep an exact
</p>
<p>list of all the groups belonging to the organization and to keep up correspondence with and
</p>
<p>between the domestic and foreign groups.
</p>
<p>7. Groups intending to join the organization must, after they have recognized its prin-

</p>
<p>ciples, send their application and list of members to the groups located nearest to them,
</p>
<p>whose duty it is then to forward such application to the Bureau of Information. The groups
</p>
<p>shall send a report of the situation to the Bureau of Information at least every three
</p>
<p>months.
</p>
<p>8. A Congress can be called at any time by a majority of the groups.
</p>
<p>9. All the necessary expenses of the Bureau of Information shall be met by voluntary
</p>
<p>contributions of the groups.
</p>
<p>Plan for the Propaganda. The organization of North America shall be divided into nine
</p>
<p>districts of agitation, as follows; i. Canada. 2. District of Columbia. 3. The Eastern
</p>
<p>States (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New
</p>
<p>York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland). 4. The Middle States (Ohio,
</p>
<p>West Virginia, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Illinois). 5. The Western
</p>
<p>States (Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Dakota, Kansas, Indian Territory and New
</p>
<p>Mexico). 6. The Rocky Mountain States (Colorado, Montana, Idaho Territory, Utah and
</p>
<p>72 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>Nevada). 7. The Pacific Coast States. 8. The Southern States (Virginia, North Caro-
</p>
<p>lina., South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisi-
</p>
<p>ana and Texas. ) 9. Mexico.
</p>
<p>It is recommended to the several districts to organize general district committees for the
</p>
<p>purpose of more effective and united action. It is the duty of these general committees to
</p>
<p>provide that whenever practicable agitators shall be sent forth. If there is a lack of proper
</p>
<p>agitators in a district the general committee shall inform the Bureau of Information. This
</p>
<p>shall be done also when there is a surplus of workers, so that the bureau shall be able to-
</p>
<p>bring about an equal distribution of the working elements.
</p>
<p>The expenses of the traveling agitators shall be paid by local groups, or, when these are
</p>
<p>without means, by the general organization.
</p>
<p>Resolutions. The following resolutions were offered by A. R. Parsons :
</p>
<p>" In consideration that the protection capitalists are men who, by excluding the cheap
</p>
<p>products of labor of competing countries, intend to make enormous profits, while the free-
</p>
<p>trade capitalists intend to make just as large profits by the sale of the cheap products of
</p>
<p>labor of other countries ; and
</p>
<p>' ' In consideration that the only difference between the two is this : That the one wants
</p>
<p>to import the products of cheap foreign labor, while the others consider it of greater advan-
</p>
<p>tage to import the cheap labor itself of other countries ; and
</p>
<p>" In consideration that it is a great injustice to tax by a protective tariff a whole people for
</p>
<p>the benefit of a few privileged capitalists or of branches of industry : Be it, therefore,
</p>
<p>"Resolved, That we, the International Workingmen's Association, consider the protec-
</p>
<p>tive tariff and free trade questions capitalistic questions, which have not the least interest for
</p>
<p>wage-workers questions which are intended ro confuse and mislead the workingman. The
</p>
<p>fight on both sides is only one for the possession of the robbed products of labor. The
</p>
<p>question whether there should be a protective tariff or free trade are political questions,
</p>
<p>which for some time past have divided governments and nations into opposing factions, but
</p>
<p>which, as already said, do not contribute toward the solution of social questions. The
</p>
<p>adage, Polvere negll occhi (throwing dust in the eyes), expresses the intentions of both parties.
</p>
<p>' ' In consideration that we see in trades-unions advocating progressive principles the
</p>
<p>abolishment of the wage system the corner-stone of a better and more just system of soci-
</p>
<p>ety than the present ; and
</p>
<p>' ' In consideration, further, that these trades~-unions consist of an army of robbed and dis-
</p>
<p>inherited fellow-sufferers and brothers, called to overthrow the economic establishments of

</p>
<p>the present time for the purpose of general and free cooperation : Be it, therefore,
</p>
<p>"Resolved, That we, the I. W. M. A., proffer the hand of fellowship to them, and give
</p>
<p>them our sympathy and help in their fight against the ever-growing despotism of private
</p>
<p>capital ; and
</p>
<p>" Resolved, That while we give such progressive trades-unions our fullest sympathy and
</p>
<p>assure them of every assistance in our power, we are, on the other hand, determined to fight
</p>
<p>and, if possible, to annihilate every organization given to reactionary principles, as these are
</p>
<p>the enemies of the emancipation of the workingmen, as well as of humanity and of progress.
</p>
<p>" In consideration that the courts of arbitration for settlement of differences between the
</p>
<p>workingmen and their employers, without the fundamental condition of free and independent
</p>
<p>action on both sides, are simply contrary to reason ; and
</p>
<p>" In consideration that a free settlement between the rich and the poor is impossible since
</p>
<p>the wage-worker has but the choice to obey or to starve ; and
</p>
<p>" In consideration that arbitration is possible and just only in case both parties are so
</p>
<p>situated that they can accept or refuse an offer entirely of their own free will : Be it, therefore,
</p>
<p>"Resolved, That arbitration between capital and labor is to be condemned. Wage-
</p>
<p>workers ought never to resort to it."
</p>
<p>THE BUREAU OF INFORMATION. 73
</p>
<p>After expressions of sympathy for the striking coal-miners in Dubois,
</p>
<p>Pa., who were advised to arm themselves for defense against the bandits of
</p>
<p>order, the resolutions proceed :
</p>
<p>' ' In consideration that our brothers and fellow combatants in the Old World are engaged
</p>
<p>in a terrible struggle against our common foe, the crowned and uncrowned despots of the
</p>
<p>world, the church and priestcraft, and thousands of them are languishing in prison and in
</p>
<p>Siberia and are suffering in exile : Be it, therefore,
</p>
<p>"Resolved, That we tender these heroic martyrs our sympathies, encouragement and aid.
</p>
<p>"In consideration that there is no material difference existing between the aims of the
</p>
<p>I. W. M. A. and the Socialistic Labor Party : Be it, therefore,
</p>
<p>"Resolved, That we invite the members of the S. L. P. to unite with us on the basis of
</p>
<p>the principles laid down in our manifesto for the purpose of a common and effective propa-
</p>
<p>ganda."
</p>
<p>Issued by order of the Pittsburg Congress of the International Workingmen's Asso-
</p>

<p>Anarchists and Socialists of Chicago took a prominent part and did every-

</p>
<p>THE Constitution of the United States guarantees the right of free
</p>
<p>speech, free discussion and free assemblage. These are the cardinal
</p>
<p>doctrines of our free institutions. But when liberty is trenched upon to
</p>
<p>the extent of advocacy of revolutionary methods, subversion of law and
</p>
<p>order and the displacement of existing society, Socialism places itself be-
</p>
<p>yond the pale of moral forces and arrays itself on the side of the freebooter,
</p>
<p>the bandit, the cut-throat and the traitor. Public measures and public men
</p>
<p>are open to the widest criticism consistent with truth, decency and justice,
</p>
<p>but differences of opinion are no more to be brought into harmony through
</p>
<p>blood than the settlement of private disputes is to be effected by means of
</p>
<p>the bludgeon, the knife or the bullet. The freedom of speech which is val-
</p>
<p>uable either to the individual or to humanity is that which builds up, not
</p>
<p>destroys, society.
</p>
<p>Now, what does Socialism, or Anarchy, precisely teach, and at what does
</p>
<p>it aim ? It is true, there are two schools of Socialism one conservative and
</p>
<p>the other radical to a sanguinary degree ; one seeking a change in existing
</p>
<p>society and government through enlightenment, and the other the attain-
</p>
<p>ment of the same principles through force. But the conservatives form so
</p>
<p>small a portion of the Socialistic body that they cut no figure in the general

</p>
<p>direction and management of the organization ; and so far as relates to the
</p>
<p>visible manifestations of that body, Socialism in the United States may be
</p>
<p>regarded as synonymous with Anarchy.
</p>
<p>As I have shown, the ostensible object of the organization in Chicago, as
</p>
<p>elsewhere, at the outset, was peaceful, but the ulterior aim the establish-
</p>
<p>ment of Socialism through force, when sufficiently powerful in numbers
</p>
<p>has in later years clearly developed. The early Socialist orators only

<p>74
</p>
<p>PARSONS' RABID TALK.
</p>
<p>75
</p>
<p>hinted at force as a possible factor in the social revolution they advocated,
</p>
<p>and it was reserved for the active agitators of the past ten years to boldly
</p>
<p>and openly proclaim for the methods of the Paris Commune.
</p>
<p>Before proceeding to particulars as to the utterances of Anarchist
</p>
<p>leaders, the sources of their inspiration and their definition of Socialism,
</p>
<p>it may be well to advert to some incidents in connection with their
</p>
<p>movements as a revolutionary party. One incident specially worthy of
</p>
<p>mention was a meeting held at Mueller's Hall, corner of Sedg-
</p>
<p>wick Street and North Avenue, on the evening of i January 12, 1885.
</p>
<p>It was a secret gathering, but, despite Socialistic jujfuk vigilance, Officer
</p>
<p>Michael Hoffman managed to re- .^__..
</p>
<p>main and quietly note the drift of
</p>
<p>the speeches. Parsons first took
</p>
<p>the floor, and said :
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, before we call this meeting
</p>
<p>to order, I want you to be sure that we are
</p>
<p>all right and all one. I want you to see
</p>
<p>if there are any reporters or policemen pres-
</p>
<p>ent. See if you can discover any spies.
</p>
<p>If you find any one here, you can do with
</p>
<p>him as you please, but my advice to you
</p>
<p>is, take him and strangle him and then
</p>
<p>throw him out of the window ; then let the
</p>
<p>people think that the fellow fell out. And
</p>
<p>if you should give one of them a chance
</p>
<p>for his life, tell him, if he has any more
</p>
<p>notions to come to our meetings, he should
</p>
<p>first go to St. Michael's Church, see the
</p>
<p>priest and prepare himself for death, say
</p>
<p>farewell to all his friends and family
</p>
<p>and then let him enter. I want all these
</p>
<p>people to know that I am not afraid of
</p>
<p>them ; I don't like them, and let them stay

</p>
<p>After precautions had been taken
</p>
<p>to exclude objectionable persons, the proceedings began. Four speeches
</p>
<p>were delivered, two in English and two in German. Parsons confined his
</p>
<p>remarks to the capitalists. All present were poor, he said, and they only
</p>
<p>had themselves to blame. One-half of all the wealth in the country belonged
</p>
<p>to the poor people, but the capitalists had robbed them of it. The poor
</p>
<p>offered no resistance, and yet the capitalist was doing the same thing day
</p>
<p>after day. He was getting richer, and the poor poorer, because the work-
</p>
<p>ing people lay down and permitted themselves to be robbed. He re-
</p>
<p>counted some of Most's experiences, and insisted that capitalists must
</p>
<p>submit to workingmen. They must be shown that their lives are worth
</p>
<p>no more than the lives of the working people.
</p>
<p>76
</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>He next touched upon the merits of a new invention by which, he said,
</p>
<p>many hundreds of houses could be set on fire, and exhibited a small tin box
</p>
<p>or can with a capacity of four ounces. This can, he remarked, could be
</p>
<p>filled with some chemical stuff to serve as an explosive. A great many of
</p>
<p>these cans could be carried in a basket, and, traveling around as match ped-
</p>
<p>dlers or under some other guise, his hearers could secure entrance to the
</p>
<p>houses of capitalists. All they would then be obliged to do was to either
</p>
<p>place or drop one of " those darlings" in a secure place and go about their
</p>
<p>business. It would do
</p>
<p>its work, without any
</p>
<p>one's presence to attend
</p>
<p>to it, in less time than
</p>
<p>an hour. If they would
</p>
<p>get the boxes ready, he
</p>
<p>would tell them where
</p>
<p>to get the "stuff." This
</p>
<p>plan of operations would
</p>
<p>keep the fire and police
</p>
<p>departments quite busy.
</p>
<p>If they organized and
</p>
<p>went to work with a
</p>
<p>resolute spirit, they
</p>
<p>could have things all
</p>
<p>their own way through-
</p>
<p>out the city and obtain
</p>
<p>possession of what re-
</p>
<p>mained after their work
</p>
<p>of destruction. He also
</p>
<p>urged all his comrades
</p>
<p>to become familiar with
</p>
<p>dynamite and said that
</p>
<p>for the necessary in-
</p>
<p>structions they could

</p>
<p>come to a building on
</p>
<p>Fifth Avenue (107, the offices of the Arbeiter-Zcitung and Alarni], where
</p>
<p>he and others could be found to help them. There was no other way now
</p>
<p>left, he continued, except for the laborers to use the sword, the bullet
</p>
<p>and dynamite, and, closing sententiously, he said :
</p>
<p>I probably will be hung as soon as I get out on the street, but if they do hang me, boys,
</p>
<p>don't forget what I have been telling you about the little can and the dear stuff, dynamite,
</p>
<p>because this is the only way I and you can get our rights.
</p>
<p>It goes without saying that Parsons was applauded to the echo. Another
</p>
<p>speaker emphasized his remarks about dynamite, but refrained from making
</p>
<p>THE OFFICE OF THE ARBEITER-ZEITUNG.

</p>

</p>
<p>a speech, because, as he said, Parsons had "covered the ground so well and
</p>
<p>thoroughly." One of the German speakers gave his attention to King
</p>
<p>William and the Pope, scoring them in the strongest language he could com-
</p>
<p>mand. He held that the "police of Chicago were only kept to protect the
</p>
<p>property of capitalists and to club poor workingmen."
</p>
<p>Another event memorable in the history of the party was the flaunting of
</p>
<p>the black flag on the streets of Chicago for the first time. On that occasion
</p>
<p>-November 25, 1884, Thanksgiving Day they marched through the
</p>
<p>fashionable thoroughfares of the South and North Divisions, and, with two
</p>
<p>women as standard-bearers for the black and the red, they made it a point
</p>
<p>to halt before the residences of the wealthy, uttering groans and using
</p>
<p>threatening language. Their route included Dearborn Street to Maple on
</p>
<p>the North Side. There they massed in front of the residence of Hon. E. B.
</p>
<p>Washburne, ex-Minister to France. They pulled the door-bell and insulted
</p>
<p>the family by indulging in all sorts of noises, groans and cat-calls. They
</p>
<p>rested satisfied with this last exhibition, and retraced their steps, proceeding
</p>
<p>to Market Square, where they dispersed.
</p>
<p>The preliminaries leading up to the procession just described were thus
</p>
<p>given in the Alarm on the following Saturday :
</p>
<p>THE BLACK FLAG.
</p>
<p>The Emblem of Hunger Unfolded by the Proletarians of Chicago. The Red Flag Borne Aloft
</p>
<p>by Thoiisands of Workingmen on Thanksgiving Day. The Poverty of the Poor is Created
</p>
<p>bv the Robbery of the Rich. Speeches, Resolutions and a Grand Demonstration of the Unem-
</p>
<p>ployed, the Tramps and Miserables of the City. Significant Incidents.
</p>
<p>Shortly before Thanksgiving Day some of the working people, lifter consultation, issued
</p>
<p>the following circular to wage- workers and tramps :
</p>
<p>The Governor has ordained next Thursday for Thanksgiving. You are to give thanks
</p>
<p>because your masters refuse you employment ; because you are hungry and without home
</p>
<p>or shelter, and your masters have taken away what you have created, and arranged to shoot
</p>
<p>you by the police or militia if you refuse to die in your hovels, in due observation of Law and
</p>
<p>Order. You must give thanks that you face the blizzards without an overcoat ; without fit
</p>
<p>shoes and clothes, while abundant clothing made by you spoils in the storehouses ; that you
</p>
<p>suffer hunger while millions of bushels of grain rots in the elevators. For this purpose a thanks-
</p>
<p>giving meeting will be held on Market Square at 2:30 o'clock, to be followed by a demonstration

</p>
<p>to express our thanks to our "Christian brothers on Michigan Avenue." Every one that feels
</p>
<p>the mockery of this Thanksgiving order should be present. Signed, the Committee of the
</p>
<p>Grateful Workingpeople's International Association.
</p>
<p>Thursday opened with sleet and rain, cold and miserable. At 2:30 over three thousand
</p>
<p>people assembled on Market Street, under the unpitying rain and sleet. A stranger said,
</p>
<p>"What you want is guns; you don't want to be heard talking." He was stopped for the
</p>
<p>regular arrangements. The meeting being called to order, A. R. Parsons said: "We assemble
</p>
<p>as representatives of the disinherited, to speak in the name of forty thousand unemployed
</p>
<p>workingmen of Chicago two millions in the United States and fifteen millions in the civilized
</p>
<p>world." He compared the Thanksgiving feast to that of Belshazzar, and said the champagne
</p>
<p>wrung from the blood of the poor ought to strangle the rich. He then read as follows : "St.
</p>
<p>James, chapter 5, says, ' Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries which
</p>
<p>are to come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten.
</p>
<p>Your gold and silver is cankered ; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and
</p>
<p>shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasures together for the last days.

<p>A THANKSGIVING MEETING. 79
</p>
<p>Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which ye have kept back by
</p>
<p>fraud, crieth : Woe to them that bring about iniquity by law. ' The prophet Habakkuk says :
</p>
<p>'Woe to him that buildeth a town by blood, and establisheth a city by iniquity.' The
</p>
<p>prophet Amos says : ' Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor to
</p>
<p>fail from the land, that I may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes. 1
</p>
<p>The prophet Isaiah says : ' Woe unto them that chain house to house, and lay field to field, till
</p>
<p>there is no place, that they may be alone in the midst of the earth. ' Solomon says : ' There
</p>
<p>is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed of their filthiness ; a
</p>
<p>generation, O, how lifted are their eyes, and how their eyelids are lifted up : A generation
</p>
<p>whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw-teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the
</p>
<p>earth, and the needy from among men. ' "
</p>
<p>And, concluding, he said : "We did not intend to wait for a future existence, but to do
</p>
<p>something for ourselves in this."
</p>
<p>He introduced S. S. Griffin, who said this was an international assembly in the interests
</p>
<p>of humanity, having no quarrel with each other and objecting to being set at work by gov-
</p>
<p>ernmental scheme. ' ' Don't believe that any government or system should be allowed to pit
</p>
<p>man against man, for any cause ; and to get at the root of these evils, we must go to the
</p>
<p>foundation of property rights and the wage system. The old system could not meet the
</p>
<p>demands of our present civilization. The present cry is against over-production, because it
</p>
<p>operates against humanity. Over-production, glutting the market, causes a lock-out, depriv-
</p>
<p>ing the wage class of the means of purchasing. Vacant houses stop the building industry,
</p>
<p>and result in throwing builders out of employment. Ragged because of a surplus of clothing ;
</p>
<p>homeless because of too many houses ; hungry because there is too much bread ; freezing
</p>
<p>because too much coal is produced. The system must be changed. Man can wear but one
</p>
<p>suit of clothes at a time and can consume only about so much. The genius of our age is
</p>
<p>inventing and increasing the productive power. A system that in effect tells the working
</p>
<p>classes that, the more they produce, the less they will have to enjoy, is a check on human prog-
</p>
<p>ress and cannot continue. Everything must be made free. No man should control what he
</p>
<p>has no personal use for. "
</p>
<p>Upon Mr. Parsons' call the resolutions were read, as follows :
</p>
<p>WHEREAS, We have outlived wage and property system ; and whereas, the right of prop-
</p>
<p>erty requires more effort to adjust it between man and man than to produce and distribute it :
</p>
<p>Resolved, That property rights should no longer be maintained or respected, and that
</p>
<p>all useless workers should be deprived of useless employment and required to engage in

</p>
<p>productive industry ; and as this is impossible under the payment system,
</p>
<p>Resolved, That no man shall pay for anything, or receive pay for anything, or deprive
</p>
<p>himself of what he may desire, that he finds out of use or vacant.
</p>
<p>Resolved, That whoever refuses to devote a reasonable amount of energy to the produc-
</p>
<p>tion or distribution of necessaries is the enemy of mankind and ought to be so treated ; and
</p>
<p>so of the willful waster.
</p>
<p>As this system cannot be introduced as against existing ignorance and selfishness without
</p>
<p>force, Resolved, That, when introduced, the good of mankind and the saving of blood requires
</p>
<p>that forcible opposition shall be dealt with summarily ; but that no one should be harmed for
</p>
<p>holding opposite opinions.
</p>
<p>Resolved, That our policy is wise, humane and practical and ought to be enforced at the
</p>
<p>earliest possible moment.
</p>
<p>As an expression of thankfulness, Resolved, That we are thankful we have learned the true
</p>
<p>cause of poverty and the remedies, and can only be more thankful when the remedy is applied.
</p>
<p>The next speaker was Samuel Fielden. He denounced the hypocrisy of calling upon
</p>
<p>people to thank God for prosperity, while providing no changes for the better, when so many
</p>
<p>people were in actual want in the midst of abundance. When he was a boy, his mother had
</p>
<p>taught him to say, ' ' Our Father who art in Heaven, " but so far as he knew, God remained
</p>
<p>there and would not come here until things were better arranged. " Our motto is, Liberty,
</p>
<p>Equality and Fraternity, emb r acing all men. Our international movement is to unite all
</p>
<p>countries and to do away with the robber class."
</p>
<p>8o
</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>August Spies spoke. Pointing to the black flag, he said it was the first time the emblem
</p>
<p>of hunger and starvation had been unfurled on American soil. He said we had got to strike
</p>
<p>down these robbers who were robbing the working people.
</p>
<p>In answer to a call from the Germans, Mr. Schwab spoke in German a few .minutes. A
</p>
<p>stranger said : " Get your guns out and go for them. That is all I have got to say." Three
</p>
<p>cheers were given for the social revolution. The audience then formed a procession three
</p>
<p>thousand strong.
</p>
<p>Another notable procession was on the evening of the opening of the
</p>
<p>new Board of Trade building. The
</p>
<p>Anarchists gathered in front of the
</p>
<p>Arbeiter-Zeitung office and were
</p>
<p>addressed by Parsons and Fielden.
</p>
<p>The speeches were highly inflam-
</p>
<p>matory. Parsons insisted that they
</p>
<p>ought to blow up the institution,
</p>
<p>and urged them to arm them-
</p>
<p>selves "to meet their oppressors
</p>
<p>with weapons." The Board of
</p>
<p>Trade, he said, was a robbers'
</p>
<p>roost, and they were reveling on
</p>
<p>the proceeds of the workingmen.
</p>
<p>"How many," he asked, "of my
</p>
<p>hearers could give twenty dollars
</p>
<p>for a supper to-night ? We will
</p>
<p>never gain anything by arguments
</p>
<p>and words. While those men are
</p>
<p>enjoying a sumptuous supper, work-
</p>
<p>ingmen are starving." He char-
</p>
<p>acterized the police as bloodhounds
</p>
<p>and servants of the robbing cap-
</p>
<p>italists, and suggested that the mob
</p>
<p>loot Marshall Field's dry-goods
</p>
<p>store and other places and secure

</p>
<p>such things as they needed. It was apparent that these sentiments appealed
</p>
<p>strongly to the inclinations of the assembled rabble, and when Parsons had
</p>
<p>concluded the mob was ready for an even more violent harangue.
</p>
<p>Fielden went as far as to urge the mob to follow him and rob those
</p>
<p>places, and, like Parsons, held that the Board of Trade building had been
</p>
<p>built out of money of which they had been robbed, and that all who trans-
</p>
<p>acted business in that place were "robbers, and thieves, and ought to be
</p>
<p>killed."
</p>
<p>There were hundreds of tramps in the throng addressed, and naturally
</p>
<p>all allusions to capitalists as robbers, and all suggestions to plunder, were
</p>
<p>greeted with applause. A procession was formed, with Oscar W. Neebe,
</p>
<p>THE BOARD OF TRADE.

</p>
<p>Parsons and Fielden at the head, and with two women following next carry-
</p>
<p>ing the red and black flags. They marched down to the Board of Trade,
</p>
<p>but, arriving at the street leading to the building, a company of police
</p>
<p>headed them off. Thus balked, they had to content themselves with march-
</p>
<p>ing through the streets back to their starting-point, where they separated
</p>
<p>without further exhibition of violence than subsequently hurling a stone
</p>
<p>through the window of a carriage occupied by a prominent West Side resi-
</p>
<p>dent and his wife, whom they took to be a millionaire on his way to the
</p>
<p>Board of Trade reception. A tougher-looking lot of men than those who
</p>
<p>composed the procession it would be difficult to find, and, once started in
</p>
<p>the direction of violence at the building, there is no telling the extent of
</p>
<p>damage they might have inflicted. The toleration of such a parade by the
</p>
<p>municipal authorities was severely criticised by the community, for, had it
</p>
<p>not been for the action of the late Col. Welter, then Inspector of Police, in
</p>
<p>intercepting the procession, a serious riot would have occurred.
</p>
<p>Parsons, when asked subsequently why they had not blown up the Board
</p>
<p>of Trade building, replied that they had not looked for police interfer-
</p>
<p>ence and were not prepared. "The next time," he said, "we will be pre-
</p>
<p>pared to meet them with bombs and dynamite." Fielden reiterated the same
</p>
<p>sentiments and expressed the opinion that in the course of a year they
</p>
<p>might be ready for the police.
</p>
<p>Now WHAT is the Socialism or Anarchy they seek to establish ? In his
</p>
<p>speech before Judge Gary in the Criminal Court, when asked why sentence
</p>
<p>of death should not be imposed upon him, Anarchist Parsons, among other
</p>
<p>things, thus described the condition of affairs when Socialism should obtain
</p>
<p>sway :
</p>
<p>Anarchy is a free society where there is no concentrated or centralized power, no state, no
</p>
<p>king, no emperor, no ruler.no president, no magistrate, no potentate of any character whatever.
</p>
<p>Law is the enslaving power of men. Blackstone defines the law to be a rule of action, pre-
</p>
<p>scribing what is right and prohibiting what is wrong. Now, very true. Anarchists hold
</p>
<p>that it is wrong for one person to prescribe what is the right action for another person, and
</p>
<p>then compel that person to obey that rule. Therefore, right action consists in each person
</p>
<p>attending to his business, and allowing everybody else to do likewise. Whoever prescribes a
</p>
<p>rule of action for another to obey is a tyrant, a usurper and an enemy of liberty. This is

<p>precisely what every statute does. Anarchy is the natural law, instead of the man-made
</p>
<p>statute, and gives men leaders in the place of drivers and bosses. All political law, statute
</p>
<p>and common, gets its right to operate from the statute ; therefore, all political law is statute
</p>
<p>law. A statute law is a written scheme by which cunning takes advantage of the unsuspect-
</p>
<p>ing, and provides the inducement to do so, and protects the one who does it. In other words,
</p>
<p>a statute is the science of rascality or the law of usurpation. If a few sharks rob mankind of
</p>
<p>all the earth, turn them all out of house and home, make them ragged slaves and beggars,
</p>
<p>and freeze and starve them to death, still they are expected to obey the statute because it is
</p>
<p>sacred. This ridiculous nonsense, that human laws are sacred, and that if they are not re-
</p>
<p>spected and continued we cannot prosper, is the stupidest and most criminal nightmare of
</p>
<p>the age. Statutes are the last and greatest curse of men, and, when destroyed, the world will
</p>
<p>be free. . . . The statute law is the great, science of rascality, by which alone the few
</p>
<p>82 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>trample upon and enslave the many. There are natural laws provided for every work of
</p>
<p>man. Natural laws are self-operating. They punish all who violate them, and reward all
</p>
<p>who obey them. They cannot be repealed, amended, dodged or bribed, and it costs neither
</p>
<p>time, money nor attention to apply them. It is time to stop legislation against them. We
</p>
<p>want to obey laws, not men, nor the tricks of men. Statutes are human tricks. The law
</p>
<p>the statute law is the coward's weapon, the tool of the thief. . . . Free access to the
</p>
<p>means of production is the natural right of every man able and willing to work. It is the
</p>
<p>legal right of the capitalist to refuse such access to labor, and to take from the laborer all the
</p>
<p>wealth he creates over and above a bare subsistence for allowing him the privilege of work-
</p>
<p>ing. A laborer has the natural right to life, and, as life is impossible without the means of
</p>
<p>production, the equal right to life involves an equal right to the means of production. . . .
</p>
<p>Laws just laws natural laws are not made ; they are discovered. Law-enacting is an
</p>
<p>insult to divine intelligence; and law-enforcing is the impeachment of God's integrity and His
</p>
<p>power.
</p>
<p>August Spies on the same memorable occasion gave his views of Social-
</p>
<p>ism in these words :
</p>
<p>Socialism is a constructive and not a destructive science. While capitalism expropriates
</p>
<p>the masses for the benefit of the privileged class ; while capitalism is that school of economics
</p>
<p>which teaches how one can live upon the labor (t. <?., property) of the other, Socialism
</p>
<p>teaches how all may possess property, and further teaches that every man must work
</p>
<p>honestly for his own living, and not be playing the respectable Board of Trade man, or any
</p>
<p>other highly too respectable business man or banker. Socialism, in short, seeks to establish
</p>
<p>a universal system of cooperation and to render accessible to each and every member of the
</p>
<p>human family the achievements and benefits of civilization, which, under capitalism, are
</p>
<p>being monopolized by a privileged class, and employed, not, as they should be, for the com-
</p>
<p>mon good of all, but for the brutish gratification of an avaricious class. Under capitalism,
</p>
<p>the great inventions of the past, far from being a blessing for mankind, have been turned
</p>
<p>into a curse ! Socialism teaches that machines, the means of transportation and communica-
</p>
<p>tion, are the result of the combined efforts of society, past and present, and that they are
</p>
<p>therefore rightfully the indivisible property of society, just the same as the soil and the mines
</p>
<p>and all natural gifts should be. This declaration implies that those who have appropriated
</p>
<p>this wealth wrongfully, though lawfully, shall be expropriated by society. The expropria-
</p>
<p>tion of the masses by the monopolists has reached such a degree that the expropriation of
</p>
<p>the expropriateurs has become an imperative necessity, an act of social self-preservation.

</p>
<p>Society will reclaim its own even though you erect a gibbet on every street-corner. And
</p>
<p>Anarchism, this terrible "ism," deduces that under a cooperative organization of society,
</p>
<p>under economic equality and individual independence, the "state" the political state
</p>
<p>will pass into barbaric antiquity. And we will be where all are free, where there are no
</p>
<p>longer masters and servants. Where intellect stands for brute force, there will no longer be
</p>
<p>any use for the policeman and militia to preserve the so-called "peace and order." Anarch-
</p>
<p>ism, or Socialism, means the reorganization of society upon scientific principles and the
</p>
<p>abolition of causes which produce vice and crime.
</p>
<p>Michael Schwab, in his utterances before the same tribunal, held as
</p>
<p>follows :
</p>
<p>Socialism, as we understand it, means that land and machinery shall be held in common
</p>
<p>by the people. The production of goods shall be carried on by producing groups which
</p>
<p>shall supply the demands of the people. Under such a system every human being would
</p>
<p>have an opportunity to do useful work, and no doubt would work. Some hours' work every
</p>
<p>day would suffice to produce all that, according to statistics, is necessary for a comfortable
</p>
<p>living. Time would be left to cultivate the mind and to further science and art. That is
</p>
<p>PLATFORM OF THE INTERNATIONALE. 83
</p>
<p>what Socialists propose. According to our vocabulary, Anarchy is a state of society in which
</p>
<p>the only government is reason. A state of society in which all human beings do right for the
</p>
<p>simple reason that it is right and hate wrong because it is wrong. In such a society no laws,
</p>
<p>no compulsion will be necessary.
</p>
<p>Samuel Fielden, standing before the same court, also dwelt upon Social-
</p>
<p>ism, saying :
</p>
<p>And it will be a good time, a grand day for the world ; it will be a grand day for humanity;
</p>
<p>it will never have taken a step so far onward toward perfection, if it can ever reach that
</p>
<p>goal, as it will when it accepts the principles of Socialism. They are the principles that
</p>
<p>injure no man. They are the principles that consider the interest of every one. They are
</p>
<p>the principles which will do away with wrong ; and injustice and suffering will be reduced at
</p>
<p>least to a minimum under such an organization of society. As compared to the present
</p>
<p>struggle for existence, which is degrading society and making men merely things and animals,
</p>
<p>Socialism will give them opportunities of developing the possibilities of their nature.
</p>
<p>The platform of the International Association of Workingmen, indorsed
</p>
<p>by the local organization, formulates the principles of Socialism as follows :
</p>
<p>1. Destruction of existing class domination, through inexorable revolution and international
</p>
<p>activity.
</p>
<p>2. The building of a free society on communistic organizations or production.
</p>
<p>3. Free exchange of equivalent products through the productive organization without
</p>
<p>jobbing and profit-making.
</p>
<p>4. Organization of the educational system upon a non-religious and scientific and equal
</p>
<p>basis for both sexes.
</p>
<p>5. Equal rights for all, without distinction of sex or race.
</p>
<p>6. The regulation of public affairs through agreements between the independent com-
</p>
<p>munes and confederacies.
</p>
<p>The above was published in the Alarm of November i, 1884, with the
</p>
<p>following comment :
</p>
<p>Proletarians of all countries, unite. Fellow workmen, all we need for the achievement of
</p>
<p>this great end is organization and unity.
</p>
<p>There exists now no great obstacle to that unity. The work of peaceful education and
</p>
<p>revolutionary conspiracy will, can and ought to run in parallel lines.
</p>
<p>The day has come for solidarity. Join our ranks ! Let the drum beat defiantly the roll
</p>
<p>of battle ; workingmen of all lands, unite ! You have nothing to lose but your chains; you

<p>have a world to win. Tremble, oppressors of the world ! Not far beyond your purblind
</p>
<p>sight there dawn the scarlet and sable lights of the judgment day !
</p>
<p>Such, in brief, are the aims of Socialism as expounded by its most
</p>
<p>extreme representatives. The state of society they seek to establish may
</p>
<p>be highly beneficial to a class which, under any conditions, lacks sobriety,
</p>
<p>frugality, thrift and self-reliance ; but just where the general mass of human-
</p>
<p>ity is to be bettered or elevated, socially, morally or politically, is a point not
</p>
<p>satisfactorily explained. Their theory may look well on paper, and their
</p>
<p>glittering generalities may draw adherents from the ranks of the illiterate
</p>
<p>and the vicious, but a condition of society in which there are no masters
</p>
<p>and no authority can only lead to chaos. In a society "in which all
</p>
<p>human beings do right for the simple reason that it is right," there can be
</p>
<p>neither stability nor permanence, unless human nature is recast, recon-
</p>
<p>84 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>strutted and regenerated. Human nature must be treated as it is found in
</p>
<p>the general make-up of man ; and therefore a society in which all special
</p>
<p>desires, all ambition and all self-elevation have been eliminated, precludes
</p>
<p>development and progress. It reduces everything to utter shiftlessness and
</p>
<p>stagnation. In such a society there can be no incentive to great achieve-
</p>
<p>ments in art, literature, mechanics or invention. If all are to be placed on
</p>
<p>an equal footing, the ignorant with the educated, the dullard with the
</p>
<p>genius, the profligate with the provident, and the drunken wretch with the
</p>
<p>industrious, what encouragement for special effort ? If vou " render accessi-
</p>
<p>ble to each and every member of the human family the achievements and
</p>
<p>benefits of civilization," holding "property in common," why should a man
</p>
<p>rack his brain or strain his muscles in producing something which he
</p>
<p>expects to prove remunerative to himself in some way, but which under the
</p>
<p>Socialistic state would go to the financial benefit of all ? Take away all
</p>
<p>incentive to improvement, and you make life scarcely worth the living.
</p>
<p>Where the state, or the "independent commune," is to be entrusted with
</p>
<p>the care and equal distribution of wealth and the employment of men,
</p>
<p>the individual will give little concern for the v morrow or for anything beyond
</p>
<p>his immediate wants. What need he accomplish more than his neighbor,
</p>
<p>since everything that is produced is shared jointly ?
</p>
<p>In the Socialistic society, every man might "work honestly for his own.
</p>
<p>living," as Spies declares, but what would be the inevitable result of a sys-
</p>
<p>tem in which the state or commune undertakes to see that all have employ-
</p>
<p>ment ?
</p>
<p>History does not leave us room for doubt. The various constitutions of.
</p>
<p>France recognized the right of the people to employment. It was provided
</p>
<p>in 1792 that it was the duty of society to afford such employment, and in
</p>
<p>the following year it was added that the remuneration of the laborer should
</p>
<p>be sufficient to support him. This doctrine was recognized until 1819,
</p>
<p>when it fell into "innocuous desuetude," and it was not revived until 1848-
</p>
<p>In that year a placard appeared on the dead walls of Paris, to the follow-
</p>
<p>ing effect :
</p>
<p>The Provisional Government of the French Republic guarantees existence to the laborer
</p>
<p>by labor. It guarantees labor to every citizen. It guarantees that laborers may associate to

</p>
<p>obtain the profits of their legitimate labor.
</p>
<p>In consequence of this proclamation the Government was appealed to,
</p>
<p>and national work-shops were established under the auspices of the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment. The establishments were open to all, but, as no one was specially
</p>
<p>interested in their financial success, they soon proved too great a drain upon
</p>
<p>the resources of the nation. Failure was the result. In the assignment
</p>
<p>of work at the factories, skill and fitness never entered into consideration.
</p>
<p>One workman was as good as another, and the men, so long as they had the
</p>
<p>Government at their back, with living guaranteed, did not bother much

<p>about the kind of article they produced. The result was that inferior goods
</p>
<p>were thrown upon the market, and purchasers were difficult to find. This
</p>
<p>speedily led to the closing of the work-shops, and since then the French
</p>
<p>Government has never maintained that society at large must operate work-
</p>
<p>shops for the benefit of all. Any commune that undertakes the same task
</p>
<p>again must similarly fail.
</p>
<p>Now, suppose that, in the new economic conditions, it should be deter-
</p>
<p>mined by the " independent communes " that wages should in a measure be
</p>
<p>fixed according to the skill, ability and energy of the workingmen, what
</p>
<p>sort of allotment would fall to the great body of workers? Edward Atkin-
</p>
<p>son, an accurate statistician of world-wide reputation, has furnished the
</p>
<p>public with a compilation showing what each would receive if the aggregate
</p>
<p>production in the United States were divided among its inhabitants. The
</p>
<p>annual production, he calculates, of all the industries of our country, does not
</p>
<p>exceed $200 per head of population. This would give a total of $12,000,000.
</p>
<p>If this were divided equally among families of five persons each, on a basis of
</p>
<p>a sixty-million population, each family would have $1,000 per annum. But,
</p>
<p>as I have said, suppose some families secure more than others, on account
</p>
<p>of greater efficiency, and that one-third of these families secure $2,000 each
</p>
<p>per annum. The remaining two-thirds would only secure an average of
</p>
<p>$500. "Suppose," it has been said, "one-half of this third to be fortunate
</p>
<p>enough, or skillful enough, to increase their average to $3,000. The remain-
</p>
<p>ing half continuing at $2,000, the average share of the two-thirds would
</p>
<p>fall to $250, or $50 only per head, per annum."
</p>
<p>As Prof. Barnard, dwelling upon the facts to be deduced from Atkin-
</p>
<p>son's showing, says: "Inasmuch as the idea of an average implies that as-
</p>
<p>many are below it as are above it, it is easy to see that the only way of
</p>
<p>removing the scourge of poverty from the entire human race is to increase
</p>
<p>the productiveness of labor so that want can only be a consequence of willful
</p>
<p>idleness, or improvidence, or vice."
</p>
<p>In the "wonderful readjustment" of wealth and the products of labor
</p>
<p>Socialists propose to inaugurate, there would be everywhere more misery,
</p>
<p>more poverty and more crime than the, people are now contending with in
</p>
<p>the purlieus of London and Paris. That there is room for improvement in

<p>the condition of our social state is true, but that changes for the better can
</p>
<p>be obtained by Socialism and by means of violence is false. These social
</p>
<p>as well as governmental improvements can only be brought about by peace-
</p>
<p>able means. Never by force, as the logic of events demonstrated in the
</p>
<p>Cook County Jail. There is no question that crack-brained theorists will
</p>
<p>continue to spring up and exist. They have existed in the past. The
</p>
<p>Babeufs, the Lassalles, the Fouriers and the Karl Marxes may continue to
</p>
<p>preach their one-sided ideas, but universal education in the United States
</p>
<p>and the general morality of the masses may be safely counted upon as a
</p>
<p>MILITARY ORGANIZATION.
</p>
<p>guaranty that neither the gospel of violence nor isolated cases of bloodshed
</p>
<p>will ever succeed in establishing exploded and ruinous theories of politics.
</p>
<p>AFTER the Socialists of Chicago had organized their military companies,
</p>
<p>it soon became evident that they intended to use their forces against organ-
</p>
<p>ized society, and as they paraded them before the community on all public
</p>
<p>occasions as a
</p>
<p>menace to good or-
</p>
<p>der, the Illinois Leg-
</p>
<p>islature in 1879 set-
</p>
<p>tled their stat us
</p>
<p>effectually by adopt-
</p>
<p>ing a law prohibit-
</p>
<p>ing armed forces in

<p>those wi 11 ing to
</p>
<p>swear to support the
</p>
<p>institutions of the
</p>
<p>State as well as of
</p>
<p>the nation, or to be-
</p>
<p>come members of
</p>
<p>the State militia. It
</p>
<p>was also made a
</p>
<p>punishable offense
</p>
<p>for any body of men
</p>
<p>to assemble with
</p>
<p>arms, drill or parade
</p>
<p>within the State
</p>
<p>without authority.
</p>
<p>The Socialists were
</p>
<p>not seeking State
</p>
<p>honors, and they
</p>
<p>took an appeal to
</p>
<p>A GROUP OF ANARCHISTS.

</p>
<p>Court on the ground
</p>
<p>that the legislative
</p>
<p>act was unconstitutional. They were beaten, and accordingly forced to
</p>
<p>abandon their ten companies.
</p>
<p>From carrying arms, however, they soon turned their attention to the
</p>
<p>study of explosives. They began experiments at once, and some years
</p>
<p>later boldly urged their adherents to become adepts in the manufacture
</p>
<p>and use of the most approved explosive dynamite.
</p>
<p>In the Alarm of October 18, 1884, the following was published :
</p>
<p>88 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>One man armed with a dynamite bomb is equal to one regiment of militia, when it is used
</p>
<p>at the right time and place. Anarchists are of the opinion that the bayonet and Catling gun
</p>
<p>will cut but sorry part in the social revolution. The whole method of warfare has been
</p>
<p>revolutionized by latter-day discoveries of science, and the American people will avail them-
</p>
<p>selves of its advantages in the conflict with upstarts and contemptible braggarts who expect to
</p>
<p>continue their rascality under the plea of preserving law and order.
</p>
<p>The same paper, in its issue of November i, 1884, contained this pro-
</p>
<p>nunciamento :
</p>
<p>How can all this be done ? Simply by making ourselves masters of the use of dynamite,
</p>
<p>then declaring we will make no further claim to ownership in anything, and deny every other
</p>
<p>person's right to be the owner of anything, and administer instant death, by any and all
</p>
<p>means, to any and every person who attempts to continue to claim personal ownership in
</p>
<p>anything. This method, and this alone, can relieve the world of this infernal monster called
</p>
<p>the "right of property."
</p>
<p>Let us try and not strike too soon, when our numbers are too small, or before more of us
</p>
<p>understand the use and manufacture of the weapons.
</p>
<p>To avoid unnecessary bloodshed, confusion and discouragement, we must be prepared,
</p>
<p>know why we strike and for just what we strike, and then strike in unison and with all our
</p>
<p>might.
</p>
<p>Our war is not against men, but against systems ; yet we must prepare to kill men who
</p>
<p>will try to defeat our cause, or we will strive in vain.
</p>
<p>The rich are only worse than the poor because they have more power to wield this
</p>
<p>infernal "property right," and because they have more power to reform, and take less
</p>
<p>interest in doing so. Therefore, it is easy to see where the bloodiest blows must be dealt.
</p>
<p>We can expect but few or no converts among the rich, and it will be better for our cause
</p>
<p>if they do not wait for us to strike first.
</p>
<p>Again, on February 21, 1885, from the same paper :
</p>
<p>The deep-rooted, malignant evil which compels the wealth-producers to become the
</p>
<p>independent hirelings of a few capitalistic czars, can not be reached by means of the ballot.
</p>
<p>The ballot can be wielded by free men alone ; but slaves can only revolt and rise in insur-
</p>
<p>rection against their despoilers.
</p>
<p>Let us bear in mind the fact that here in America, as elsewhere, the worker is held in
</p>
<p>economic bondage by the use of force, and the employment of force, therefore, becomes a
</p>
<p>necessity to his economic preservation. Poverty can't vote !

<p>In the same issue also appeared the following :
</p>
<p>Dynamite ! Of all the good stuff, this is the stuff. Stuff several pounds of this sublime
</p>
<p>stuff into an inch pipe (gas or water pipe), plug up both ends, insert a cap with a fuse
</p>
<p>attached, place this in the immediate neighborhood of a lot of rich loafers who live by the
</p>
<p>sweat of other people's brows, and light the fuse. A most cheerful and gratifying result
</p>
<p>will follow. In giving dynamite to the downtrodden millions of the globe science has
</p>
<p>done its best work. The dear stuff can be carried in the pocket without danger, while it is
</p>
<p>a formidable weapon against any force of militia, police or detectives that may want to
</p>
<p>stifle the cry for justice that goes forth from the plundered slaves. It is something not very
</p>
<p>ornamental, but exceedingly useful. It can be used against persons and things. It is better
</p>
<p>to use it against the former than against bricks and masonry. It is a genuine boon for the
</p>
<p>disinherited, while it brings terror and fear to the robbers. A pound of this good stuff beats
</p>
<p>a bushel of ballots all hollow, and don't you forget it ! Our law-makers might as well try to
</p>
<p>sit down on the crater of a volcano or a bayonet as to endeavor to stop the manufacture and
</p>
<p>use of dynamite. It takes more justice and right than is contained in laws to quiet the
</p>
<p>spirit of unrest.
</p>
<p>PREACHING MURDER. 89
</p>
<p>In the Arbeiter-Zeitung of March 19, 1886, appeared the following,
</p>
<p>after many articles had been previously published of the same tenor as
</p>
<p>those in the Alarm :
</p>
<p>The only aim of the workingman should be the liberation of mankind from the shackles
</p>
<p>of the existing damnable slavery. Here, in America, where the workingman possesses yet
</p>
<p>the freedom of meeting, of speech, and of the press, most should be done for the emancipa-
</p>
<p>tion of suffering mankind. But the press gang and the teachers in the schools do all in their
</p>
<p>power to keep the people in the dark. Thus everything tends to degrade mankind more and
</p>
<p>more, from day to day, and this effects a " beastening, " as is observable with Irishmen, and
</p>
<p>more apparent, even, with the Chinese.
</p>
<p>If we do not soon bestir ourselves for a bloody revolution, we can not leave anything to
</p>
<p>our children but poverty and slavery. Therefore prepare yourselves, in all quietness, for
</p>
<p>the revolution.
</p>
<p>The following extracts are from the first number of the Anarchist,
</p>
<p>Engel's paper, dated January i, 1886, with the motto/ "All government we
</p>
<p>hate" :
</p>
<p>Workingmen and fellows : We recognize it our duty to contend against existing rule,
</p>
<p>but he who would war successfully must equip himself with all implements adapted to destroy
</p>
<p>his opponents and secure victory. In consideration thereof we have resolved to publish the
</p>
<p>Anarchist as a line in the fight for the disinherited. It is necessary to disseminate Anarchistic
</p>
<p>doctrine. As we strive for freedom from government we advocate the principle of autonomy,
</p>
<p>in this sense : We strive towards the overthrow of the existing order, that an end may be
</p>
<p>put to the "abhorrent work of destruction on the part of mankind, and fratricide done away."
</p>
<p>The equality of all, without distinction of race, color or nationality, is our fundamental
</p>
<p>principle, thus ending rule and servitude. We reject reformatory endeavors as useless play,
</p>
<p>adding to the derision and oppression of the workingmen. Against the never-to-be-satisfied
</p>
<p>ferocity of capital we recommend the radical means of the present age. All endeavors of the
</p>
<p>working classes not aiming at the overthrow of existing conditions of ownership and at com-
</p>
<p>plete self-government are to us reactionary. The idea of the absence of authority warrants
</p>
<p>that we will carry on a fight of principles only. . . .
</p>
<p>No one can deny that man brings with him into the world the right to live. But this is
</p>
<p>denied by the property beast. He who has the whip of power will brandish it over the poor.
</p>
<p>What does the world offer to the poor who are compelled to carry on a mere struggle for
</p>
<p>existence ? Patented machinery, combined with capital and other means of preservation,

<p>denies work to the workmen on account of the excessive offer of working powers. Working-
</p>
<p>men should, therefore, enter the ranks of those who propose to set aside the present system
</p>
<p>of inequality and build up a system of equality and freedom. Let every one join the Inter-
</p>
<p>national Workingmen's Association, and arm himself with the best weapons of modern
</p>
<p>times. . . .
</p>
<p>The authorities in America have hitherto refused to prosecute Anarchists as the European
</p>
<p>powers do, not because of hatred to despotism, but from fear that the American people
</p>
<p>might be driven into Anarchism. As Anarchists increase, however, it is intended to to away
</p>
<p>with them by slow degrees. To this end a bill was introduced in Congress refusing to and
</p>
<p>revoking citizenship of such. Yet the Anarchist declines citizenship because he regards him-
</p>
<p>self as cosmopolitan. We hope for more foolish things to open the eyes of American work-
</p>
<p>ingmen. . . .
</p>
<p>Reflections of an Anarchist at the Grave of Leiske. After the workingman becomes a
</p>
<p>journeyman he feels free, casts a glance into the world it is glorious, beautiful. He thinks
</p>
<p>there is happiness for him somewhere. He proposes to go abroad, but a terrible cry falls upon
</p>
<p>his ears the outcry of a tormented people. He inquires, have the pariahs of to-day a right
</p>
<p>90 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>to live ? and answers yes. Why otherwise born, if suffered to die with hunger ? And hunger
</p>
<p>and poverty are the results of the stealings of the rich. Having thus concluded, he swears
</p>
<p>to help in the work of liberation, "in the great struggle of mankind for a better condition ; "
</p>
<p>to take vengeance upon those responsible for this misery. In his investigations he learns the
</p>
<p>utter vileness of the police power, and a policeman is killed. Whereupon the workman is
</p>
<p>arrested, charged with the murder of Rumpf, and killed after nearly a year of most devilish
</p>
<p>torture. With what contempt Leiske met his executioners, and with what heroism he went
</p>
<p>unto his death, is known to our fellows, and he shall be avenged.
</p>
<p>The Alarm, January 13, 1885 :
</p>
<p>"Force the only defense against injustice and oppression." Because the Socialists
</p>
<p>advocate resistance, they are accused of brutality and want of wisdom. All men agree that
</p>
<p>themselves should not be trampled upon by others. If you can compel a man to agree to
</p>
<p>allow others to exercise control over him, you will find that the soldier will soon claim all
</p>
<p>you have acquired for yourselves. This only teaches that it is dangerous for the wicked to
</p>
<p>teach war ; not so with justice. Justice can never create opposition to itself. Therefore
</p>
<p>" justice is always safe in accumulating force, while injustice can only accumulate force at
</p>
<p>its peril." We are told force is cruel, but this is only true when the opposition is less cruel.
</p>
<p>If the opposition is relentless power, starving, freezing, etc., and the application of force will
</p>
<p>require less suffering, then force is humane. Tharefore we say that dynamite is both humane
</p>
<p>and economical. It will, at the expense of less suffering, prevent more. It is not humane
</p>
<p>to compel ten persons to starve to death, when the execution of five persons would prevent
</p>
<p>it. A system that is starving and freezing tens of thousands of little children, in the midst
</p>
<p>of a world of plenty, cannot be defended against dynamiters on the ground of humanity. If
</p>
<p>every child that starved to death in the United States were retaliated for by the execution of
</p>
<p>a rich man in his own parlor, the brutal system of wage property would not last six weeks.
</p>
<p>It is a wonder that a father, after his vain search for bread, can see his little ones starve or
</p>
<p>freeze, without striking that vengeful, just and bloody blow at the cause that would prevent
</p>
<p>other little ones suffering a similar fate. It is not probable that men will always endure this
</p>
<p>cruel, relentless process of monopoly and competition.
</p>
<p>The privileged class use force to perpetuate their power, and the despoiled workers must
</p>
<p>use force to prevent it.

<p>Officer of the United States Army has to Say.
</p>
<p>The following letter, published in the San Francisco Truth some time ago, will be read
</p>
<p>with interest. The letter is quoted as follows, in substance : "I am an officer in the army
</p>
<p>of the United States, and know whereof I write. " John Upton said to me, with great earnest-
</p>
<p>ness, that the day of armies is passing away. I . believe this. This introduces my subject.
</p>
<p>I desire to place the details of the science of butchery before the people; to point out its
</p>
<p>weak points, so that in future uprisings the people may stand some chance of winning. They
</p>
<p>have for the past twenty years been overcome only because of their own ignorance. They
</p>
<p>have been slaughtered and subdued because of a lack of coolness, want of knowledge, and
</p>
<p>adherence to what is called ' humanity, ' ' honorable warfare, ' etc. I assume that my readers
</p>
<p>agree with me that against tyrants all means are legitimate, and that in war that course is
</p>
<p>best, though bloodiest, which soonest ends the contest. My purpose is to persuade the people
</p>
<p>to add a little common sense in future to their heroism, and thus insure success.
</p>
<p>" United States and State regiments are organized on the unit of four, which permits the
</p>
<p>most rapid and effective change of front that can be devised. The art of war consists in
</p>
<p>making soldiers fight. The line of retreat must be kept open to avoid capture. In future

<p>revolts the people shall assume the aggressive. Army officers have wasted years of study
</p>
<p>over the science of street fighting, unavailingly. The plan below shows a method adopted
</p>
<p>as best. The troops are formed on the street in two bodies in column of four, headed by
</p>
<p>a Galling gun. On the sidewalk a line of skirmishers and sharpshooters, whose duty it is to
</p>
<p>fire into the houses, the whole advancing cautiously. When a cross street is reached, a com-
</p>
<p>pany is left to hold it, in order to keep open the avenue of retreat. Military knowledge has
</p>
<p>become popularized since 1877, and now, in almost any contest, it would be easy to find
</p>
<p>some fair leaders of the people who would devise some means of meeting such an advance,
</p>
<p>as indicated by the following diagram. The diagram represents a street corner. The plan
</p>
<p>is, at the street crossing to have bodies of revolutionists with movable barracks placed ob-
</p>
<p>liquely on the cross street, and who from there will fire vigorously upon the advancing column.
</p>
<p>They have supporters also in the building, also at the corner, whose duty is to throw-
</p>
<p>dynamite upon the troops. If the position is carried, the party defending escape through
</p>
<p>the cross streets. The rear of the column can also be attacked from the cross streets. If
</p>
<p>the men in the barricades are armed with the new international dynamite rifle (which I am
</p>
<p>told exists in the hands of the revolutionists), I give it as a careful technical opinion, that,
</p>
<p>pursuing these tactics under brave and able leaders, fifty men can hold at bay and finally
</p>
<p>destroy in any of your cities an attacking force of five thousand troops." Signed " R. S. S."

</p>
<p>Bakounine's Groundwork for the Social Revolution. A Revolutionist's Duty to Himself . (Free
</p>
<p>translation from the German.)
</p>
<p>1. The revolutionist is self-offered ; has no personal interest, but is absorbed by the one
</p>
<p>passion, the revolution.
</p>
<p>2. He is at war with the existing order of society and lives to destroy it.
</p>
<p>3. He despises society in its present form and leaves its reorganization to the future,
</p>
<p>himself knowing only the science of destruction. He studies mathematics, chemistry, etc.,
</p>
<p>for this purpose. The quick and sure overthrow of the present unreasonable order is his
</p>
<p>object.
</p>
<p>4. He despises public sentiment and acknowledges as moral whatever favors the revolu-
</p>
<p>tion ; as criminal whatever opposes it.
</p>
<p>5. He is consecrated ; he will not spare, nor does he expect mercy. Between him and
</p>
<p>society reigns the war of death or life.
</p>
<p>6. Stringent with himself, he must be stringent with others. All sentiment must be

</p>
<p>suppressed by his passion for the revolutionary work. He must be ready to die and to kill.
</p>
<p>7. He excludes romance and sentiment and also personal hatred and revenge; never
</p>
<p>obeying his personal inclinations, but his revolutionary duty.
</p>
<p>Toward his Comrades.
</p>
<p>8. His friendship is only for his comrade, and is measured by that comrade's usefulness
</p>
<p>in the practical work of the revolution.
</p>
<p>9. As to important affairs, he must consult with his comrades, but in execution depend
</p>
<p>upon himself. Each must be self -operating, and must ask help only when imperatively
</p>
<p>necessary.
</p>
<p>10. He shall use himself and his subordinates as capital to be used for the work of
</p>
<p>revolution, but no part of which can he dispose of without the consent of the persons in-
</p>
<p>volved.
</p>

</p>
<p>est of the cause.

<p>13. He lives in a so-called civilized world because he believes in its speedy destruction
</p>
<p>He clings to nothing as it now is, and does not hesitate to destroy any institution. He is no
</p>
<p>revolutionist if arrested by personal ties.
</p>
<p>14. He must obtain entrance everywhere, even in the detective agency and the emperor's
</p>
<p>palace.
</p>
<p>15. The present society should be divided into categories, the first including those sen-
</p>
<p>tenced to immediate death, the others classifying the delinquents according to their rascality.
</p>
<p>16. The lists are not to be influenced by personal considerations, but those are to be
</p>
<p>first destroyed whose death can terrify governments and deprive them of their most intelligent
</p>
<p>agents.
</p>
<p>17. The second category embraces those who are permitted to live, but whose evil deeds
</p>
<p>will drive the people to
</p>
<p>open revolt.

</p>

</p>
<p>The Alarm of January 9, 1886, then edited, in the absence of its editor
</p>
<p>and his assistant, by August Spies, contained this suggestive editorial :
</p>
<p>"The Right to Bear Arms." After the conspiracy of the workingmen, the working classes,
</p>
<p>in 1877, the breaking up of the meeting on the Haymarket Square, the brutal assault upon a
</p>
<p>gathering of furniture workers in Vorwaerts Turner Hall, the murder of Tessman, and the
</p>
<p>general clubbing and shooting down of peaceably inclined wage-workers, the proletarians
</p>
<p>organized the Lehr und Wehr Verein, which in about a year and a half had grown to a mem-
</p>
<p>bership of one thousand. This was regarded by the capitalists as a menace, and they pro-
</p>
<p>cured the passage of the militia law, under which it became an offense for any body of men,
</p>
<p>other than those authorized by the Governor, to assemble with arms, drill or parade the streets.
</p>
<p>The members of the Lehr und Wehr Verein, mostly Socialists, who believed in the ballot,
</p>
<p>made up a test case to determine the constitutionality of this act, rejecting the counsel of the
</p>
<p>extremists. Judge Barnum held the law to be unconstitutional an appeal was taken and
</p>
<p>94 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>the Supreme Court upset this decision and held the law constitutional. Thereupon the
</p>
<p>Lehr und Wehr Verein applied to the Supreme Court of the United States, which within
</p>
<p>a few days affirmed the decision of the Supreme Court of the State. Do we need comment
</p>
<p>on this ?
</p>
<p>That militia law has had its uses. Where there was before a military body publicly
</p>
<p>organized, whose strength could be easily ascertained, now there exists an organization
</p>
<p>whose members cannot be estimated, and a network of destructive agencies of modern mili-
</p>
<p>tary character that will defy suppression.
</p>
<p>The Arbeiter-Zeitung, February 17, editorial:
</p>
<p>In France, during strikes, etc., a new method is lately adopted. The workingmen
</p>
<p>barricade themselves in the factories with provisions, taking possession of the property,
</p>
<p>which the manufacturers desire to preserve, and will only resort to force for their ejection in
</p>
<p>the most extreme case. The conflict between capitalism and workingmen is growing con-
</p>
<p>stantly sharper, and the indication is that force will bring about decisive results in the battle
</p>
<p>for liberty.
</p>
<p>The Arbeiter-Zeitung of April 30 :
</p>
<p>We are advised that the police are ordered to be ready for a conflict upon Saturday of
</p>
<p>next week. The capitalists are thirsting for the blood of workingmen. The workingmen
</p>
<p>refuse longer to be tortured and treated like dogs, and for this opposition the capitalists cry
</p>
<p>for blood. Perhaps they may have it, and lose some of their own. To the workingmen
</p>
<p>we again say : Arm yourselves, but conceal your arms lest they be stolen from you.
</p>
<p>The Arbeiter-Zeitung, May 3 :
</p>
<p>Courage, courage, is our cry. Don't forget the words of Herways : " The host of the
</p>
<p>oppressors grow pale when thou, weary of thy burden, in the corner puttest the plow ; when
</p>
<p>thou sayest, 'It is enough.'"
</p>
<p>The Arbeiter-Zeitung, May 4 :
</p>
<p>Blood has flown. It happened as it had to. The militia have not been drilling in vain.
</p>
<p>It is historical that private property had its origin in violence. The war of classes has
</p>
<p>come. Yesterday, in front of McCormick's factory, workmen were shot down whose blood
</p>
<p>cries for vengeance. In the past, countless victims have been offered on the altars of the
</p>
<p>golden calf amid the shouts of the capitalistic robbers. One has only to think of East St.
</p>
<p>Louis, Chicago and other places, to recognize the tactics of the extortioners. The white
</p>
<p>terror will be answered with the red, for the workmen are not asleep. They modestly asked
</p>
<p>for eight hours. The answer was to drill the police force and militia, and browbeat those

<p>advocating the change. And yesterday blood flowed the reply of these devils to this modest
</p>
<p>petition of their slaves. Death rather than a life of wretchedness. The capitalistic tiger
</p>
<p>lies ready for the jump, his eyes sparkling, eager for murder, and his clutches drawn tight.
</p>
<p>Self-defense cries, "To arms, to arms!" If you do not defend yourselves, you will be
</p>
<p>ground by the animal's teeth.
</p>
<p>The powers hostile to the workingmen have made common cause, and our differences
</p>
<p>must be subordinated to the common purpose. The statement of the capitalistic press, that
</p>
<p>the workmen yesterday fired first, is a bold, barefaced lie.
</p>
<p>In the poor shanty miserably clad women and children are weeping for husband and
</p>
<p>father. In the palace they clink glasses filled with costly wine and drink to the happiness
</p>
<p>of the bloody bandits of law and order. Dry your tears, ye poor and wretched ; take
</p>
<p>heart, ye slaves ; arise in your might and overthrow the system of robbery.

<p>These are a few of the many articles emanating from the Socialistic

<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>Another source from which to draw inspiration was Reinsdorf, the
</p>
<p>apostle of Anarchy in Germany. The Chicago Anarchists regarded him as
</p>
<p>a splendid representative of their class, and praised his attempt on the life
</p>
<p>of the Emperor of Germany. His death on the scaffold was regarded as
</p>
<p>martyrdom, and his deeds were frequently extolled. His confederates in
</p>
<p>conspiracy, Hoedel and Nobiling, were referred to in terms of praise by
</p>
<p>George A. Schilling at a meeting in West Twelfth Street Turner Hall.
</p>
<p>Louis Lingg had been personally acquainted with Reinsdorf, and gloried
</p>
<p>in the man's work and courage. The extreme section of the Chicago
</p>
<p>Socialists always
</p>
<p>sought to inculcate his
</p>
<p>ideas, and that the
</p>
<p>reader may gain some
</p>
<p>notion of Reinsdorf's
</p>
<p>character, I reproduce
</p>
<p>the following transla-
</p>
<p>tion from a German
</p>
<p>Socialistic paper, show-
</p>
<p>ing his career :
</p>
<p>He was the principal
</p>
<p>leader of all the Anarchists
</p>
<p>in Germany. The people
</p>
<p>looked upon him as the
</p>
<p>savior of their great cause.
</p>
<p>He was admired not only by
</p>
<p>men, but also by women.
</p>
<p>Wherever he went he was
</p>
<p>given great receptions, and
</p>
<p>he had many pupils.
</p>
<p>Reinsdorf was born in
</p>
<p>Prussia. When he became
</p>
<p>of age, he joined the party,
</p>
<p>and, by his good and rapid

</p>
<p>work, became in a short
</p>
<p>time the father of the An-
</p>
<p>archistic agitation. But the law pursued him, and he wandered from state to state. In
</p>
<p>the year 1876 we find him in Switzerland, where he had many followers. One of his
</p>
<p>pupils and admirers was Max Hoedel, who with Reinsdorf conceived a plot to murder
</p>
<p>King William of Prussia. The attack upon his life was made by Hoedel on the nth day of
</p>
<p>May, 1878. He fired several shots at the aged warrior, but failed, as none of them took
</p>
<p>effect. They missed their mark. Not satisfied with this, another man, Dr. Nobiling, also a
</p>
<p>pupil of Reinsdorf, made another attempt three weeks later, by firing a shot-gun filled
</p>
<p>with buck-shot at the old King ; but again without effect. Nobiling's deed was the
</p>
<p>consequence of Hoedel's attempt, and Reinsdorf was the agitator. Failing in this, they
</p>
<p>concluded to wait some time until their party should get stronger and could secure
</p>
<p>better material. Among others Louis Lingg joined the Anarchists in Zurich. Louis was
</p>
<p>then very young, but he became as radical as their chief leader. The Socialists were

<p>AUGUST REINSDORF.
</p>
<p>REINSD ORE'S D ESP ERA TE PL O T. 97
</p>
<p>to have held a Congress there in May, 1880, but the gathering did not take place,
</p>
<p>as the police had notice, and Reinsdorf and his followers were compelled to leave
</p>
<p>Zurich and go to Freiburg (Baden), where they held secret meetings and where Reinsdorf
</p>
<p>declared that he himself would go to Berlin and kill the miserable mahdi by stabbing
</p>
<p>him to the heart. He went to Berlin to carry out this plan, but was arrested by the
</p>
<p>police. They could not make out a case of conspiracy against him, but he was sent to prison
</p>
<p>for several months on the charge of carrying a dagger. After his discharge Reinsdorf traveled
</p>
<p>to and from Switzerland to Germany, France and Belgium, speaking in all places where he
</p>
<p>stopped, and gaining many followers. His only desire was to put old Emperor William (com-
</p>
<p>monly called "old Lehmann") out of the way to do something great so that all the people
</p>
<p>would look up to him. His only targets were royal palaces and the palaces of diplomates. He
</p>
<p>and others then formed a plan to murder the King, and Bismarck, and all the princes and others
</p>
<p>who were to participate in the dedication of the Germania monument at Ruedesheim on the
</p>
<p>28th day of September, 1883. But Reinsdorf met with an accident while crossing a railroad
</p>
<p>track, and was severely injured. This was a very painful situation for Reinsdorf. The day
</p>
<p>for action drew near, but he was confined to his bed. Should this beautiful plan be given
</p>
<p>up on that account ? Never ! Could not other people accomplish what he had thought out ?
</p>
<p>Certainly. But was it sure that they would have the necessary courage at the critical moment ?
</p>
<p>Could he trust them ? Tormented by such thoughts, Reinsdorf finally submitted to the
</p>
<p>inevitable and confided his mission to two of his comrades. He called these people to his
</p>
<p>bedside and told them what he wanted done. He presented his plan in detail. Rupsch and
</p>
<p>Kuechler these are their names pledged themselves to do what he desired. They started
</p>
<p>on the journey with the necessary material, reached Ruedesheim safely, and on the night of
</p>
<p>the ayth they proceeded to a spot not far from the monument, where the railroad runs near
</p>
<p>the edge of the forest. They filled a culvert with a large quantity of dynamite, put a fulmin-
</p>
<p>ating cap into it and drew the fuse into the forest. It was raining at the time, and they
</p>
<p>covered the fuse with moist ground and tied the end of it to a tree, which they marked by
</p>
<p>cutting into it. They then returned to Ruedesheim. The next morning they returned to the
</p>
<p>place. The royal train came. Kuechler gave the signal ; Rupsch held his burning cigar to
</p>
<p>the fuse. One moment of breathless expectation ! The train passed, and the explosion
</p>
<p>failed. Kuechler asked Rupsch about the failure. The latter showed that the end of the
</p>
<p>fuse had been lighted, but did not burn because it was damp. They did not give up hope, as
</p>
<p>the train had to return the same way after the ceremonies were over. A new fuse was
</p>
<p>attached. Again the royal party passed over the critical ground, where death had been pre-

</p>
<p>pared for them. Rupsch lit the fuse again, but it did not burn. An investigation afterwards
</p>
<p>showed that the fuse only burned a short length and then went out. They had followed all
</p>
<p>Reinsdorf 's instructions but one instead of water-proof fuse they had supplied them-
</p>
<p>selves with the common kind. With mutual recriminations, Kuechler and Rupsch took the
</p>
<p>dynamite from under the culvert and went back to Ruedesheim, where they got gloriously
</p>
<p>drunk. After they had sobered up, they returned to Elberfeld and reported to Reinsdorf,
</p>
<p>who already knew that his beautiful plan had miscarried. With great wrath he listened to
</p>
<p>them and said : " No such thing could have happened to me." He thought there would be
</p>
<p>another chance. Then he would not be in the hospital, but could carry it out himself. His
</p>
<p>hopes were in vain. After his discharge from the hospital in Elberfeld, he proceeded to
</p>
<p>Frankfort-on-the-Main, where he was arrested. The police found out that he was an
</p>
<p>accomplice in the conspiracy, but, putting him through the sieve, they failed to get anything
</p>
<p>out of him, as he would not answer a single question. He said : "You may ask me as much
</p>
<p>as you wish, I shall not answer." Bachman, one of his companions and an accomplice,
</p>
<p>escaped to Luxemburg, where he thought he would be safe from the law, but he also was
</p>
<p>arrested and extradited and sent to Elberfeld to keep Reinsdorf company, together with
</p>
<p>Rupsch and Kuechler.
</p>
<p>98 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>Reinsdorf and his accomplices were tried before the courts of Leipsic, and the trial
</p>
<p>lasted seven days. Bachman and two others were sentenced to ten years in the penitentiary.
</p>
<p>Rupsch got a life sentence, while Reinsdorf was sentenced to be beheaded. At his trial
</p>
<p>Reinsdorf was as stubborn as ever. He denied everything. When he was asked who he was
</p>
<p>he answered :
</p>
<p>"I am an Anarchist."
</p>
<p>"What is Anarchy ? " he was asked.
</p>
<p>"A company in which every sensible man can develop his ability. To permit this no on&
</p>
<p>should be burdened with excessive labor ; want and misery should be banished ; every force
</p>
<p>should cease; every stupidity, every superstition should be banished from the world."
</p>
<p>The presiding judge asked him if he was guilty or not, and to answer with "yes"
</p>
<p>or "no."
</p>
<p>Reinsdorf answered with a steady voice : "I look upon this whole thing as a question of
</p>
<p>power. If we German Anarchists had a couple of army corps at our disposition, then I
</p>
<p>would not have to talk to this court. I for my part have nothing to say. Do with me as
</p>
<p>you please."
</p>
<p>After the court had finished, Reinsdorf resumed his remarks and said : "The attempt at
</p>
<p>Niederwald failed because 'the hand of Providence appeared," as the prosecution terms it. I
</p>
<p>tell you the awkward hand of Rupsch did it. I am sorry to say I had no one else at my
</p>
<p>disposal. I have nothing to repent, only that the attempt failed. At the factories the-
</p>
<p>people are going to ruin merely for the benefit of the stockholders. These honest Christians-
</p>
<p>swindle the working people of half of their living. My lawyer wanted to save my head, but
</p>
<p>for such a hounded proletarian as I am the quickest death is the best. If I had ten heads I
</p>
<p>would offer them with joy and lay them on the block for the good cause."
</p>
<p>Before going to the scaffold, Reinsdorf ate a hearty meal, smoked a cigar, and sang a
</p>
<p>song. He walked steadily into the court-yard, where the scaffold was standing, guarded by
</p>
<p>a squad of soldiers, besides about a hundred other persons.
</p>
<p>"Are you August Reinsdorf ? " asked the sheriff.
</p>
<p>"Yes, that I am."
</p>
<p>The death warrant was then read and the royal signature shown to him. The exe-
</p>
<p>cutioner then bore him to the scaffold. Reinsdorf 's last words were : ' ' Down with barbar-
</p>
<p>ism ; hurrah for Anarchy ! " The axe fell and the head was severed from his body.
</p>
<p>The atonement for the decapitation of Reinsdorf followed quickly. The sentence had
</p>
<p>hardly been carried into execution when, on the i3th of January, 1885, "the miserable

<p>Rumpff, " as they called him, was stabbed and killed by the hand of an Anarchist at Frankfort-
</p>
<p>on-the-Main. Sic semper tyrannis.
</p>
<p>With such an example of courage before them, and the revenge his
</p>
<p>execution invited, it is almost needless to remark that the bloodthirsty
</p>
<p>Anarchists of Chicago read with eager avidity anything pertaining to their
</p>
<p>hero. Accordingly, in the Vorbote of December 16, 1885, the following is-
</p>
<p>to be found :
</p>
<p>REINSDORF'S INHERITANCE.
</p>
<p>In the pamphlet about Reinsdorf there is a letter published which our great martyr wrote-
</p>
<p>the day previous to his decapitation. We are able now to publish two other letters which
</p>
<p>Reinsdorf wrote at the same time, to his parents and to his second brother.
</p>
<p>One letter reads as follows :
</p>
<p>HALLE, February 6, 1885.
</p>
<p>My Dear Brother : To-day is my last day, and I could not let it pass without writing to'
</p>
<p>you to show you that I always remembered you with brotherly love. When you have read
</p>
<p>KEINSDOltF'S LETTERS. 99
</p>
<p>this letter I shall be one of the fortunates who are past and one of whom they can speak
</p>
<p>nothing but good. Now, my deeds, specially alleged against me before the courts, lie open
</p>
<p>before the world, and, although I am sentenced to death, I have the feeling that I did my
</p>
<p>duty ; and this feeling it is which makes my last walk easy, to receive joyfully the everlasting
</p>
<p>sleep as something well earned.
</p>
<p>Dear August, you have often had trouble and sorrow, although you are in the blossom of
</p>
<p>life. People usually heed the words of one deceased more than the speeches of philosophers.
</p>
<p>I want to tell you a few words. Bear with strength, endurance and friendly submission the
</p>
<p>burden which you have laden upon yourself, and try to have satisfaction in it, so you can
</p>
<p>raise your children that they may be useful to you and an adornment to you. What would
</p>
<p>you gain by it, if you should participate in the good-for-nothing diversions of the people ?
</p>
<p>Think, I could have done it, but I preferred the wandering existence of an Anarchist.
</p>
<p>When you, therefore, in years to come, look back upon the days of honest, peaceable labor
</p>
<p>done, and of hard duty fulfilled, then you will be filled with a joyful certainty and a quiet
</p>
<p>happiness that will repay you for all your sufferings. We still live, unfortunately, in a world
</p>
<p>of egotism and incompleteness, and only a few are in position to swim against the stream
</p>
<p>even at the risk of their lives. You never did it. Good. So do your duty as the father of
</p>
<p>your family. Good-by. Accept a greeting from my heart for your wife and family, from
</p>
<p>Your brother, AUGUST.
</p>
<p>The second letter is directed to his parents :
</p>
<p>HALLE, February 6, 1885.
</p>
<p>My Dear Parents: Take in silence what cannot be helped ! Who would sacrifice their chil-
</p>
<p>dren, if not you, who have so many ? Or should the wealthy do it, when it is the cause of
</p>
<p>the poor for which we fight ? Or should we lay our hands in our laps and wait until others
</p>
<p>have sacrificed themselves for us ? And is it such a great sacrifice I bring ? Sick as I am,
</p>
<p>and with a prospect of long suffering, it should be looked upon as a blessing when such an
</p>
<p>existence is put to a quick death. And what an end is it ? Whoever they are, progressive
</p>
<p>or reactionary, liberal or conservative, they all hate the Anarchist Reinsdorf. As they have
</p>
<p>condemned his doings, they cheer his death, the crown of a faithful, self-sacrificing man.
</p>
<p>But his steadfastness, in defiance of thousands of obstacles, no one can deny. And this shall
</p>
<p>be your consolation.
</p>
<p>How many have had to die for smaller causes ? How many have lost their lives in
</p>
<p>dynamite conquests ? Take all this in consideration and don't let your hearts be made heavy
</p>
<p>through the babble of paltry and narrow-minded people. My last thoughts are of you

<p>and of brothers and sisters, and of the great cause for which I die. Deep-felt wishes fill
</p>
<p>my heart for the prosperity of every one of you. Greetings to my brothers and sisters,
</p>
<p>especially Carl, Emilie, Emma and Anna, to whom I could not write personally. Shake
</p>
<p>once more their hands for me. You and I embrace with all the love of childhood, and I greet
</p>
<p>you a thousand times. Good-by, all. Yours, AUGUST.
</p>
<p>What Herr Johann Most, the present American leader of the irreconcil-
</p>
<p>ables, thought of Reinsdorf, may be judged by the following extracts from
</p>
<p>Host's biography :
</p>
<p>From the i5th to the 22nd of December, 1884, eight workingmen, who had been captured
</p>
<p>in the war of the poor against the rich, were sitting in the dock, not to have justice passed
</p>
<p>upon them, but to await the sentence of might which the judges, acting as mouth-pieces for
</p>
<p>the ruling powers, had in preparation for them. The most prominent figure among these
</p>
<p>victims of a barbaric order of society was August Reinsdorf. To this man my little book is
</p>
<p>to be a tribute of esteem.
</p>
<p>I am well aware of the difficulty of my otherwise quite modest undertaking, to write a
</p>
<p>biography of the father of the Anarchistic movement within the territory of the German
</p>
<p>100
</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>language, yet I hope to do the brothers near and far a service, for the time being at least, by
</p>
<p>sketching for them a likeness of a true hero of the Social Revolution. . . .
</p>
<p>Indeed Reinsdorf was not an agitator of the common sort. Speeches delivered occasion-
</p>
<p>ally or written articles were to him only means to a higher purpose incentives to action.
</p>
<p>Since he had recognized his ideal in Anarchism ; . . . since the necessity of the
</p>
<p>' tactics of terror " had dawned upon him in contradistinction to the tactics of petitioning,
</p>
<p>voting, ' ' parliamenting, " bargaining, and of the peaceable and legitimate hide-and-seek prac-
</p>
<p>tice all his thinking and planning was directed to but one thing, he knew of but one
</p>
<p>endeavor, he gave his entire being to
</p>
<p>but one motive power of the Social Re-
</p>
<p>volution that was the propaganda cf
</p>
<p>action.
</p>
<p>In this regard he may be put beside
</p>
<p>the most noble conspirators of ancient
</p>
<p>and modern times . . .
</p>
<p>To be a revolutionist indeed, one
</p>
<p>must possess the faculty of thinking with
</p>
<p>the most acute clearness. But religious
</p>
<p>"fog" is the opposite of clearness of
</p>
<p>intellect. Yea, where religious non-
</p>
<p>sense has once taken a deep root, there
</p>
<p>every mental development is actually
</p>
<p>excluded, and a kind of idiocy formally
</p>
<p>takes its place. . . .
</p>
<p>Quite different does the matter stand
</p>
<p>in the case of a "proletarian." If he
</p>
<p>once recognize the old Lord God with
</p>
<p>his thunderbolt as an invented scare-
</p>
<p>crow which a shrewd gang of rascals
</p>
<p>have placed before paradise, that man
</p>
<p>should not eat of the tree of knowl-
</p>
<p>edge, but that he should rather wait in
</p>
<p>patience for the roasted birds which,

</p>
<p>after his death, come flying into his
</p>
<p>mouth from a heavenly kitchen, if the
</p>
<p>poor devil has learned to see that his
</p>
<p>namesake, too, wherewith they had tried to scare him previously, is also an invention
</p>
<p>of malicious swindlers, then he soon applies the rule of the critic to the "high " and "high-
</p>
<p>est" idols of earth. He loses respect for the so-called "Governments" and more and more
</p>
<p>learns to see in them a horde of brutal tormentors. These custodians of existing treasures
</p>
<p>attract his eye also to the possessors of the riches of the earth, and soon the question dawns
</p>
<p>upon him, Who has created all these things ? The answer comes of itself. He and his like
</p>
<p>have done that. To them, therefore, belongs the whole world. They only need to take.
</p>
<p>Thus the man, having cut loose from God, becomes the revolutionist par excellence.
</p>
<p>After Reinsdorf had succeeded in finding people who he thought were fit to take part in
</p>
<p>revolutionary actions and even risk their lives, he was also fortunate enough to discover a source
</p>
<p>from which dynamite, that glorious stuff which will literally make a road for liberty, could be
</p>
<p>procured.
</p>
<p>And how did he die ? Shortly before the moment of death, and while in the hands of the
</p>
<p>hangman, he cried out : "Down with barbarism ! Let Anarchy live ! "
</p>
<p>JOHANN MOST.
</p>
<p>TACTICS OF THE REVOLUTION. 101
</p>
<p>These are admonishing words, which no one should leave unheeded who marches under
</p>
<p>the flag of the Revolution.
</p>
<p>Well, then ! Let us act accordingly ! Away with all sentimental hesitation when it comes
</p>
<p>to strike a blow against State, Church and Society and their representatives, as wsll as against
</p>
<p>all that exists.
</p>
<p>Let us never forget that the revolutionists of modern times can enter into the society
</p>
<p>of free and equal men only over ruins and ashes, over blood and dead bodies.
</p>
<p>Let us rise to the height of an August Reinsdorf ! Let us complete the work which he so
</p>
<p>boldly began ! Only thus can we avenge ourselves ; only thus can we show ourselves worthy
</p>
<p>of him ; only thus can we conquer.
</p>
<p>Workingmen ! Look down into the freshly dug pit. There lies your best friend and
</p>
<p>adviser, an advance champion of your cause, a martyred witness to the greatness of the
</p>
<p>Anarchistic idea. Live, strive and act as he ! Anarchists, in your name I lay the well-earned
</p>
<p>laurel-wreath upon his grave. . . .
</p>
<p>The retribution for the annihilation of Reinsdorf came rapidly. Scarcely had the sen-
</p>
<p>tence been spoken, and before it had been executed, the dagger of a Nemesis had already
</p>
<p>taken revenge. On January 13, 1885, the head of the German detective forces, the miser-
</p>
<p>able Rumpff, was stabbed to death by the hand of an Anarchist.
</p>
<p>" Sic semper tyrannis So be it to all tyrants ! " was heard everywhere. With great satis-
</p>
<p>faction every honorable man, especially every man of work, experienced that Rumpff had to
</p>
<p>die because he was the cause of Reinsdorf's death. . . .
</p>
<p>The combustibles are heaped up. Proletarians, throw the igniting spark amongst
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>Up with force ! Let the Social Resolution live !
</p>
<p>The revolutionists of Chicago appear more careful about exposing
</p>
<p>themselves to danger than their foreign co-conspirators, and, while counsel-
</p>
<p>ing bloodshed, suggest ways of bringing about destruction with a minimum
</p>
<p>of danger. In the Arbeiter-Zeitung of March 16, 1885, there appeared the
</p>
<p>following editorial, suggesting the most effective way of using dynamite :
</p>
<p>In all revolutionary action three different epochs of time are to be distinguished : First
</p>
<p>the portion of preparation for an action, then the moment of the action itself, and finally
</p>
<p>that portion of time which follows the deed. All these portions of time are to be considered
</p>
<p>one after another.
</p>

</p>
<p>to be sacrificed, that is, in other words, the danger of discovery ought to be weakened as much
</p>
<p>as possible, and, if it can be, should be reduced to naught. This calls for one of the most
</p>
<p>important tactical principles, which briefly might be formulated in the words : Saving of the
</p>
<p>combatants. All this constrains us to further explain the measures of organization and
</p>
<p>tactics which must be taken into consideration in such an action.
</p>
<p>Mention was made of the danger of discovery. That is, in fact, present in all three of
</p>
<p>the periods of conflict. This danger is imminent in the preparation of the action itself, and
</p>
<p>finally, after the completion thereof. The question is now, How can it be met ?
</p>
<p>If we view the different phases of the development of a deed, we have, first, the time of
</p>
<p>preparation.
</p>
<p>It is easily comprehensible for everybody that the danger of discovery is the greater the
</p>
<p>more numerous the mass of people or the group is which contemplates a deed, and vice versa.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the threatening danger approaches the closer the better the acting
</p>
<p>persons are known to the authorities of the place of action, and vice versa. Holding fast to
</p>
<p>this, the following results :
</p>
<p>In the commission of a deed, a comrade who does not live at the place of action that
</p>
<p>102 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>is, a comrade of some other place ought, if possibility admits, to participate in the action ;
</p>
<p>or, formulated differently, a revolutionary deed ought to be enacted where one is not
</p>
<p>known.
</p>
<p>A further conclusion which may be drawn from what was mentioned is this :
</p>
<p>Whoever is willing to execute a deed has, in the first place, to put the question to himself,
</p>
<p>whether he is able, or not, to carry out the action by himself. If the former is the case, let
</p>
<p>him absolutely initiate no one into the matter and let him act alone ; but if that is not the
</p>
<p>case, then let him look, with the greatest care, for just so many fellows as he must have,
</p>
<p>absolutely not one more nor less ; with these let him unite himself into a fighting
</p>
<p>group.
</p>
<p>The founding of special groups of action or of war is an absolute necessity. If it were
</p>
<p>attempted to make use of an existing group to effect an action, discovery of the deed would
</p>
<p>follow upon its heels, if it came to a revolutionary action at all, which would be very
</p>
<p>doubtful. It is especially true in America, where reaction has velvet paws, and where
</p>
<p>asinine confidence is, from a certain direction, directly without bounds. In the preparation,
</p>
<p>even, endless debates would develop ; the thing would be hung upon the big bell ; it would
</p>
<p>be at first a public secret, and then, after the thing was known to everybody, it would also
</p>
<p>reach the long ears of the holy Hermandad (the sacred precinct of the watchman over the
</p>
<p>public safety), which, as is known to every man, woman and child, hear the grass grow and
</p>
<p>the fleas cough.
</p>
<p>In the formation of a group of action, the greatest care must be exercised. Men must
</p>
<p>be selected who have head and heart in the right spot.
</p>
<p>Has the formation of a fighting group been effected, has the intention been developed,
</p>
<p>does each one see perfectly clear the manner of the execution, then action must follow with
</p>
<p>the greatest possible swiftness, without delay, for now they move within the scope of the
</p>
<p>greatest danger, simply from the very adjacent reason, because the select allies might yet
</p>
<p>commit treason without exposing themselves in so doing.
</p>
<p>In the action itself, one must be personally at the place, to select personally that point of
</p>
<p>the place of action, and that part of the action, which are the most important and are
</p>
<p>coupled with the greatest danger, upon which depend chiefly the success or failure of the
</p>
<p>whole affair.
</p>
<p>Has the deed been completed, then the group of action dissolves at once, without fur-
</p>
<p>ther parley, according to an understanding which must be had beforehand, leaves the place of
</p>
<p>action, and scatters in all directions.

<p>If this theory is acted upon, then the danger of discovery is extremely small yea,
</p>
<p>reduced to almost nothing, and from this point of view the author ventures to say, thus, and
</p>
<p>not otherwise, must be acted, if the advance is to be proper.
</p>
<p>It would be an easy matter to furnish the proof, by the different revolutionary acts in
</p>
<p>which the history of the immediate past is so rich, that the executors sinned against the one
</p>
<p>or the other of the aforementioned principles, and that in this fact lies the cause of the dis-
</p>
<p>covery, and the loss to us of very important fellow-champions connected therewith ; but we
</p>
<p>will be brief, and leave that to the individual reflection of the reader. But one fact is estab-
</p>
<p>lished that is this : That all the rules mentioned can be observed without great difficulty ;
</p>
<p>further, that the blood of our best comrades can be spared thereby ; finally, as a conse-
</p>
<p>quence of the last-mentioned, that light actions can be increased materially, for the complete
</p>
<p>success of an action is the best impulse to a new deed, and the things must always succeed
</p>
<p>when the rules of wisdom are followed.
</p>
<p>A further question which might probably be raised would be this : In case a special or
</p>
<p>conditional group must be formed for the purpose of action, what is the duty, in that case,
</p>
<p>of the public groups, or the entire public organization, in view of the aforesaid action ? The
</p>
<p>answer is very near at hand. In the first place, they have to serve as a covering as a
</p>
<p>DE TO CQ UE VILLES DEFINITION. 1 03
</p>
<p>shield behind which one of the most effective weapons of revolution is bared ; then these
</p>
<p>permanent groups are to be the source from which the necessary pecuniary means are drawn
</p>
<p>and fellow-combatants are recruited ; finally, the accomplished deeds are to furnish to per-
</p>
<p>manent groups the material for critical illustration. These discussions are to wake the
</p>
<p>spirit of rebellion, that important lever of the advancing course of the development of our
</p>
<p>race, without which we would be forever nailed down to the state of development of a
</p>
<p>gorilla or an orang-outang. This right spirit is to be inflamed, the revolutionary instinct is to
</p>
<p>be roused which still sleeps in the breast of man, although these monsters, which, by an
</p>
<p>oversight of nature, were covered with human skin, are earnestly endeavoring to cripple the
</p>
<p>truly noble and elevated form of man by the pressure of a thousand and again a thousand
</p>
<p>years to morally castrate the human race. Finally, the means and form of conquest are
</p>
<p>to be found by untiring search and comparison, which enhance the strength of each prole-
</p>
<p>tarian a thousandfold, and make him the giant Briareus, alone able to crush the ogres
</p>
<p>of Capital.
</p>
<p>I have thus shown the manner and methods by which Socialism seeks
</p>
<p>to gain a foothold in America. In their declarations of principles and
</p>
<p>encouragements to violence, these agitators have proved themselves traitors
</p>
<p>to their country or the country of their adoption, and ingrates to society.
</p>
<p>They have sought, and are seeking, to establish "Anarchy in the midst of
</p>
<p>the state, war in times of peace, and conspiracy in open day." They are
</p>
<p>the "Huns and Vandals of modern civilization. >;
</p>
<p>As De Tocqueville says : " Democracy and Socialism are the antipodes
</p>
<p>of each other. While Democracy extends the sphere of individual inde-
</p>
<p>pendence, Socialism contracts it. Democracy develops a man's whole
</p>
<p>manhood ; Socialism makes him an agent, an instrument, a cipher. Dem-
</p>
<p>ocracy and Socialism harmonize on one point only the equality which
</p>
<p>they introduce. But mark the difference : Democracy seeks equality in

</p>
<p>WHILE the Socialists are bent on a revolution in the economic con-
</p>
<p>dition of the working class, or, as they choose to term it, the
</p>
<p>proletariat, they have conclusively shown that they do not desire to
</p>
<p>further that movement by pacific means. Imbued with the doctrines of
</p>
<p>violence and intent on the complete destruction of government, they do not
</p>
<p>seek their end by orderly, legitimate methods. This fact has been most
</p>
<p>thoroughly established by the extracts from their public declarations which
</p>
<p>I have already given.
</p>
<p>But if any doubts still exist with reference thereto, they are completely
</p>
<p>dissipated by an examination into the attitude assumed by the Socialists
</p>
<p>toward the labor problem as it exists at the present day. It is not my pur-
</p>
<p>pose to enter into a detailed review of the whole field. I will simply call
</p>
<p>attention to one fact, and in that fact one sweeps the labor horizon, viewed
</p>
<p>from the Socialistic standpoint, as the astronomer sweeps the heavens with
</p>
<p>his telescope, striking the most prominent objects within the range of obser-
</p>
<p>vation. This one fact is the position of the Socialists toward the eight-hour
</p>
<p>movement.
</p>
<p>It is generally known that many economists and agitators, with neither
</p>
<p>affiliations nor sympathy for Socialism, have been contending for years that
</p>
<p>with the rapid increase in labor-saving machinery and the consequent dis-
</p>
<p>placement of labor, reduction in the hours of service has become an absolute
</p>
<p>necessity. The points made in support of this position are numerous, and
</p>
<p>as the most salient ones appear in a memorial on the part of a National
</p>
<p>Labor Convention to the Committee on Depression in Labor and Business
</p>
<p>of the Forty-sixth Congress, drafted November 10, 1879, I may briefly quote
</p>
<p>a few. The memorial asked a reduction :
</p>
<p>1. In the name of political economy. "All political economists are

</p>
<p>agreed," they said, "that the standard of wages is determined by the cost
</p>
<p>of subsistence rather than by the number of hours employed. Wages are
</p>
<p>recognized as resulting from the necessary cost of living in any given com-
</p>
<p>munity. The cost of subsistence for an average family determines the rate,
</p>
<p>and it is for this reason that single men can save more if they will. "
</p>
<p>2. In the interest of civilization. "The battle for a reduction of the
</p>
<p>THE EIGHT-HOUR QUESTION. 105
</p>
<p>hours of labor is a struggle for a wider civilization." With less hours, more
</p>
<p>leisure is afforded for mental and social improvement. In proof the memo-
</p>
<p>rialists appealed to the past and to the fact that one day of rest in seven has
</p>
<p>raised the social condition of the people. Besides, they urged, the "history
</p>
<p>of the short-hour movement in England proved conclusively that every
</p>
<p>reduction of time in the United Kingdom had invariably been followed by
</p>
<p>an increase of wages," and the consequent improvement of workingmen.
</p>
<p>3. The changed relations between production and consumption demand
</p>
<p>remedial legislation. A reduction of houfs would give more men employ-
</p>
<p>ment. Under existing conditions, capital and production have increased
</p>
<p>while the number of persons employed has fallen off.
</p>
<p>These are doctrines one would think the Socialist, pretending to have
</p>
<p>the interests of labor at heart, would unquestionably and heartily indorse.
</p>
<p>Far from it. True to his nature as a social disturber, disorganizer and
</p>
<p>malcontent, he sees in it a possible solution of many labor troubles and
</p>
<p>the approach to a rearrangement of existing conditions on a basis different
</p>
<p>from his own theories. When this question arose in Chicago in the winter
</p>
<p>of 1885-86, the Alarm entered its most emphatic protest. In its issue of
</p>
<p>December 12, 1885, ithad this to say, under the heading, "No Compromise ":
</p>
<p>We of the Internationale are frequently asked why we do not give our active support to
</p>
<p>the proposed eight-hour movement. Let us take what we can get, say our eight-hour friends,
</p>
<p>else by asking too much we may get nothing.
</p>
<p>We answer : Because we will not compromise. Kither our position that capitalists have
</p>
<p>no right to the exclusive ownership of the means of life is a true one, or it is not. If we are
</p>
<p>correct, then to concede the point that capitalists have the right to eight hours of our labor, is
</p>
<p>more than a compromise ; it is a virtual concession that the wage system is right. If capital-
</p>
<p>ists have the right to own labor or to control the results of labor, then clearly we have no
</p>
<p>business dictating the terms upon which we may be employed. We cannot say to our
</p>
<p>employers, ' ' Yes, we acknowledge your right to employ us ; we are satisfied that the wage
</p>
<p>system is all right, but we, your slaves, propose to dictate the terms upon which we will
</p>
<p>work. " How inconsistent ! And yet that is exactly the position of our eight-hour friends.
</p>
<p>They presume to dictate to capital, while they maintain the justness of the capitalistic sys-
</p>
<p>tem ; they would regulate wages while defending the claims of the capitalists to the absolute
</p>
<p>control of industry.

</p>
<p>These sentiments were frequently reiterated by A. R. Parsons, who was
</p>
<p>the editor of the Alarm ; and in August Spies he found an energetic ally.
</p>
<p>Among other things Spies said concerning the movement :
</p>
<p>We do not antagonize the eight-hour movement. Viewing it from the standpoint that
</p>
<p>it is a social struggle, we simply predict that it is a lost battle, and we will prove that, even
</p>
<p>though the eight-hour system should be established at this late day, the wage-workers would
</p>
<p>gain nothing. They would still remain the slaves of their masters.
</p>
<p>Suppose the hours of labor should be shortened to eight, our productive capacity would
</p>
<p>thersby not be diminished. The shortening of the hours of labor in England was imme-
</p>
<p>diately followed by a general increase of labor-saving machines, with a subsequent discharge
</p>
<p>of a proportionate number of employes. The reverse of what had been sought took place.
</p>
<p>The exploitation of those at work was intensified. They now performed more labor, and
</p>
<p>produced more than before.
</p>
<p>io6 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>The movement, however, took a firm hold of the laboring classes. They
</p>
<p>saw in it a chance to secure more leisure, and, inspired by their anti-Social-
</p>
<p>istic leaders, did all in their power to further it. There were then in Chi-
</p>
<p>cago a great many unemployed, and under the plea that a reduction in the
</p>
<p>hours of toil would not only give more time for self-improvement, but
</p>
<p>necessitate the employment of many of the idle throng, the leaders advo-
</p>
<p>cated its speedy introduction. At this time the general sentiment prevailed
</p>
<p>that it was simply a movement for a reduction in working-time, the ques-
</p>
<p>tion of wages not being involved. Some few irresponsible talkers of the
</p>
<p>Socialistic stamp, it is true, held out that it was to be a contention for wages
</p>
<p>as well, but the most influential and conservative representatives of labor
</p>
<p>insisted that they only wanted eight hours' work for eight-hours' pay. Grand
</p>
<p>Master Workman Powderly held to the latter view and repeatedly urged the
</p>
<p>members of the Knights of Labor not to go beyond that demand. He
</p>
<p>even intimated a doubt if it were the part of wisdom and policy to under-
</p>
<p>take at the time a strike of the kind, in view of the complications then
</p>
<p>growing out of the Missouri Pacific Railway known as the Gould sys-
</p>
<p>tem "tie-up." Traffic and industry had been seriously affected through-
</p>
<p>out the West by Martin Irons' stubbornness, and it is evident that Powderly
</p>
<p>had his misgivings about the outcome of an eight-hour strike. However,
</p>
<p>the leaders continued their agitation, and it was decided that the resolution
</p>
<p>adopted in 1884 by a number of trades organizations in national session
</p>
<p>for an eight-hour strike on May i, 1886, should be carried out in Chicago,
</p>
<p>as in other large manufacturing and trade centers. Had this simple prop-
</p>
<p>osition not been "loaded, " the result of the movement might have been
</p>
<p>different, but, as the time drew near, it became quite apparent that, despite
</p>
<p>Powderly's warnings, the question of wages was to cut a leading figure. It
</p>
<p>was developed that the demand for a reduction of hours was to be accom-
</p>
<p>panied with a demand for the same wages as under the old ten-hour system.
</p>
<p>This was the rock upon which they subsequently foundered. Had they been
</p>
<p>content to accept decreased wages and relied upon increased efficiency and
</p>
<p>skill and the logic of events to secure increased pay in the future, they
</p>
<p>might have scored many victories, if not a complete success.
</p>
<p>But they were alike unmindful of Powderly's advice and the teachings

<p>of history. They seemingly forgot that the employers would naturally
</p>
<p>resist any such sweeping concession, and that, as in other instances, the
</p>
<p>unemployed would at once be installed, whenever possible, in their places,
</p>
<p>and that in industries where there did not exist an overproduction, the
</p>
<p>capacity of machines would be more heavily taxed and new machines would
</p>
<p>be introduced to do work hitherto done by hand. A London publication
</p>
<p>has shown how, in recent years, in the extremity of bitter strikes, manu-
</p>
<p>factories have increased their labor-saving machinery to offset the absence
</p>
<p>of their workmen and how invention in the line of new machines has been

</p>
<p>: -greatly stimulated by a stubborn conflict between employer and employed
</p>
<p>Hon. David A. Wells has also pointed out a similar result in this country.
</p>
<p>Identically the same thing happened in several establishments in Chicago.
</p>
<p>The unemployed and new machines were called into requisition whenever
</p>
<p>possible.
</p>
<p>But labor-saving machinery need not necessarily be regarded as an
</p>
<p>-enemy of labor. That doctrine, which had its origin at the time when a
</p>
<p>riot in Spain followed the introduction of a machine to make woolens, and
</p>
<p>which continued until the invention of the sewing-machine, has in this day
</p>
<p>come to be regarded by all enlightened economists as a nightmare of the
</p>
<p>musty past. The fact is labor has been aided and benefited by machinery.
</p>
<p>Prof. Edison, the great inventor, is authority for the statement that the
</p>
<p>.increase in machinery and inventions during the last fifty years has doubled
</p>
<p>the wages of workingmen and reduced the cost of the necessaries of life 50
</p>
<p>jper cent. "For the first time in the world's history," he says, "a skilled
</p>
<p>mechanic can buy a barrel of flour with a single day's work." Hon. David
</p>
<p>A. Wells, in an article in the Popular Science Monthly for October, 1887,
</p>
<p>treating of the depression of prices since 1873, also demonstrates the fact
</p>
<p>that the reductions, which he states to be 30 per cent., during the time
</p>
<p>.under his review, are due to inventions. Edison goes still further in
</p>
<p>his statement with reference to the enhancement of wages. He predicts,
</p>
<p>rather too glowingly perhaps, that in another generation even "the unskilled
</p>
<p>laborer, if sober and industrious, will have a house of his own, a library, a
</p>
<p>piano and a horse and carriage," with all the comforts that these imply.
</p>
<p>Anarchist Spies evidently took no stock in such a condition as the result
</p>
<p>of new and improved mechanical appliances, for in his early opposition to
</p>
<p>the inauguration of the eight-hour movement he declared that "for a man
</p>
<p>who desires to remain a wage slave, the introduction of every new improve-
</p>
<p>ment and machine is a threatening competitor."
</p>
<p>I have thus pointed to some facts bearing on strikes and wages because
</p>
<p>it has since transpired that the Anarchists or Socialists, intent on precipitat-
</p>
<p>ing the "social revolution," were the principal instigators of the demand
</p>
<p>-for ten hours' pay for eight hours' work, thereby hoping to irritate the em-
</p>
<p>ployers to determined resistance and the workingmen of non-Socialistic

</p>
<p>ideas to the point of violence. Past experience was cast aside under their
</p>
<p>clandestine guidance. While the movement was in its infancy the Socialists,
</p>
<p>as such, held aloof, but, the moment they saw that it was gaining strength
</p>
<p>and was likely to involve all the wage-workers in the city, and that eight
</p>
<p>hours on a basis of reduced pay might be secured, they perceived their
</p>
<p>opportunity to complicate matters by the introduction of a demand for the
</p>
<p>old wages with reduced time. This at once threw down the gauntlet.
</p>
<p>While before they had opposed the movement, they now became active
</p>
<p>agitators in its behalf and appeared more solicitous about its certain inaug-
</p>
<p>io8 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>uration than they were about its successful ending. Their organs bristled'
</p>
<p>with incendiary language. Their speakers could hardly find words strong
</p>
<p>enough to fire their auditors in the demand for eight hours. They even got
</p>
<p>up a procession under the auspices of the Central Labor Union, and, on
</p>
<p>Sunday, April 25, 1886, paraded the streets with red flags and red badges.
</p>
<p>Among some of the mottoes displayed were : " The Social Revolution,"
</p>
<p>"Workingmen, Arm Yourselves," "Down with Throne, Altar and Money-
</p>
<p>bags," and "Might makes Right, and You are the Strongest."
</p>
<p>The procession massed on the Lake Front. There the leading speakers
</p>
<p>were loud in encouraging the strike for eight hours. Parsons maintained that
</p>
<p>"if the demands of workingmen were met by a universal lock-out, the signal
</p>
<p>would be taken as one of 'war, and war to the knife. ' " Spies declared
</p>
<p>that "the eight-hour day had been argued for twenty years. We at last
</p>
<p>can hope to realize it." Schwab and Fielden were alike emphatic.
</p>
<p>The Arbeiter-Zeitung likewise heartily indorsed the movement. In its
</p>
<p>issue of April 26, 1886, appeared an editorial of which the following is
</p>
<p>the concluding paragraph :
</p>
<p>What a modest demand, the introduction of the eight-hour day ! And yet a corps of
</p>
<p>madmen could not demean themselves worse than the capitalistic extortioners. They con-
</p>
<p>tinually threaten with their disciplined police and their strong militia, and these are not
</p>
<p>empty threats. This is proved by the history of the last few years. It is a nice thing, this
</p>

<p>longer a question of the eight-hour day, but a question of emancipation from wage slavery.
</p>
<p>In the same paper two days later .the editor said :
</p>
<p>What will the first of May bring ? The workingmen bold and determined. The decisive-
</p>
<p>day has arrived. The workingman, inspired by the justice of his cause, demands an allevia-
</p>
<p>tion of his lot, a lessening of his burden. The answer, as always, is: "Insolent rabble!
</p>
<p>Do you mean to dictate to us ? That you will do to your sorrow. Hunger will soon rid
</p>
<p>you of your desire for any notions of liberty. Police, executioners and militia will give
</p>
<p>their aid."
</p>
<p>Men of labor, so long as you acknowledge the gracious kicks of your oppressors with
</p>
<p>words of gratitude, so long you are faithful dogs. Have your skulls been penetrated by a
</p>
<p>ray of light, or does hunger drive you to shake off your servile nature, that you offend your

</p>
<p>extortioners ? They are enraged, and will attempt, through hired murderers, to do away
</p>
<p>with you like mad dogs.
</p>
<p>When the eventful day May i arrived, the A rbeiter-Zeitung became
</p>
<p>more menacing than ever, and the following appeared :
</p>
<p>Bravely forward ! The conflict has begun. An army of wage-laborers are idle. Capi-
</p>
<p>talism conceals its tiger claws behind the ramparts of order. Workmen, let your watchword
</p>
<p>be : No compromise ! Cowards to the rear ! Men to the front !
</p>
<p>The die is cast. The first of May has come. For twenty years the working people have
</p>
<p>been begging extortioners to introduce the eight-hour system, but have been put off with
</p>
<p>promises. Two years ago they resolved that the eight-hour system should be introduced in
</p>
<p>the United States on the first day of May, 1886. The reasonableness of this demand was
</p>
<p>conceded on all hands. Everybody, apparently, was in favor of shortening the hours ; but, as
</p>
<p>the time approached, a change became apparent. That which was in theory modest and

</p>
<p>of a workingman more than

<p>reasonable, became insolent and unreasonable. It became apparent at last that the eight-
</p>
<p>hour hymn had only been struck up to keep the labor dunces from Socialism.
</p>
<p>That the laborers might energetically insist upon the eight-hour movement, never occurred
</p>
<p>to the employer. And it is proposed again to put them off with promises. We are not
</p>
<p>afraid of the masses of laborers, but of their pretended leaders. Workmen, insist upon the
</p>
<p>eight-hour movement. "To all appearances it will not pass off smoothly." The extor-
</p>
<p>tioners are determined to bring their laborers back to servitude by starvation. It is a
</p>
<p>question whether the workmen will submit, or will impart to their would-be murderers an
</p>
<p>appreciation of modern views. We hope the latter.
</p>
<p>In the same issue of the Arbeiter-Zeitung also appeared the following, in
</p>
<p>a conspicuous place :
</p>
<p>It is said that on the person of one of the arrested comrades in New York a list of
</p>
<p>membership has been found, and that all the comrades compromised have been arrested.
</p>
<p>Therefore, away -with all rolls of membership, and minute-books, where such are kept. Clean your
</p>
<p>guns, complete your ammunition. The hired murderers of the capitalists, the police and militia,
</p>
<p>are ready to murder. No workingman should leave his house in these days with empty pockets.
</p>
<p>The consummate inconsistency of the Socialists is thus no better illus-
</p>
<p>trated in what has already been shown than in their record in Chicago.
</p>
<p>They have always been eager to jump on top of the band wagon, to para-
</p>
<p>phrase a famous expression of Emery A. Storrs, when they thought that it
</p>
<p>gave them a chance to join in the lead of the procession ; and, the moment
</p>
<p>they had a voice in directing the music, they led it beyond the mere senti-
</p>
<p>ments of a Marseillaise. Take each formidable strike in the city, and
</p>
<p>invariably they have instigated the rabble to deeds of disorder and violence.
</p>
<p>What care they for labor reforms accomplished through peaceable agita-
</p>
<p>tion? It is only when a pretext is presented for widening the breach
</p>
<p>between capital and labor, and hastening the time for revolution, that the
</p>
<p>Socialists join in any movement looking to the real benefit of labor. It is
</p>
<p>true, they have figured in labor reforms, such as the agitation for national
</p>
<p>and State bureaus of labor statistics, the abolition of convict labor in com-
</p>
<p>petition with outside industries, the prevention of child labor in factories
</p>
<p>and work-shops, the sanitary inspection of tenement-houses and factories ;
</p>
<p>but all these have been merely side issues to their one and controlling pur-
</p>
<p>pose Revolution. For appearance' sake they have boasted of their achieve-

<p>ments in the lines indicated, but it "is a fact of history that, without the
</p>
<p>efforts of non-Socialistic labor, none of the reforms so far accomplished
</p>
<p>would ever have been secured. The fact is that Socialists and Anarchists
</p>
<p>are radically opposed to the whole wage system and only join in the
</p>
<p>demands of law-observing and peace-loving labor as a means to one end
</p>
<p>opportunity for disturbance. For this purpose alone they have become
</p>
<p>members of the Knights of Labor, and, once in, they have proved an ele-
</p>
<p>ment of disorder and contention. So pronounced had they become in
</p>
<p>fomenting trouble during the eight-hour agitation that Mr. Powderly
</p>
<p>finally found it necessary to issue a secret circular to the order in the spring
</p>
<p>of 1886. In that circular, among other things, he said :
</p>
<p>POWDERLY'S SECRET CIRCULAR.
</p>
<p>in
</p>
<p>Men who own capital are not our enemies. If that theory held good, the workman of to-
</p>
<p>day would be the enemy of his fellow-toiler on the morrow, for, after all, it is how to acquire
</p>
<p>capital and how to use it properly that we are endeavoring to learn. No ! The man of capital
</p>
<p>is not necessarily the enemy of the laborer ; on the contrary, they must be brought closer
</p>
<p>together. I am well aware that some extremists will say I am advocating a weak plan and

<p>will say that bloodshed and destruction of property alone will solve the problem. If a man
</p>
<p>speaks such sentiments in an assembly read for him the charge which the Master Workman
</p>
<p>repeats to the newly initiated who join our "army of peace." If he repeats such nonsense
</p>
<p>put him out.

</p>
<p>THE events immediately preceding the inauguration of the eight-hour
</p>
<p>strike were remarkable in the opportunities they afforded Anarchists
</p>
<p>for arousing workingmen against capital and stirring up their worst
</p>
<p>passions. The leaders had already intensified the clamor for reduced
</p>
<p>working-time, and only the occasion was needed to fully arouse the true
</p>
<p>ruffianism behind the Socialistic rabble. This occasion was presented in
</p>
<p>the troubles that grew out of the "lock-out" at McCormick's Harvester
</p>
<p>Works, and, as the facts in connection therewith are necessary to a clear
</p>
<p>and comprehensive understanding of the situation, I shall briefly review
</p>
<p>them. Before doing so, however, it may be well to premise by saying that
</p>
<p>the real state of affairs in that trouble was greatly exaggerated, and that,
</p>
<p>instead of dividing responsibility, the Socialistic orators sought to throw the
</p>
<p>sole burden upon the owners and managers of that establishment, charging
</p>
<p>them, in the heat and excitement of the times, with gross violation of pledged
</p>
<p>faith to the men employed, and instigating even violent resistance to the
</p>
<p>installation of new men, or "scabs," as they were opprobriously termed,
</p>
<p>into the vacated places.
</p>
<p>This so-called "lock-out" occurred on February 16, 1886, and through
</p>
<p>it some twelve hundred men became idle. The Anarchists proceeded at
</p>
<p>once to distort every fact in connection with it. The view they presented
</p>
<p>of the affair may be best shown by "the following extract from a history of
</p>
<p>the Chicago Anarchists published by the Socialistic Publishing Society :
</p>
<p>The employes of that establishment had been for some time perfecting their organization,
</p>
<p>and at last had presented a petition for the redress of certain grievances and a general advance

</p>
<p>of wages. The dispute arose over an additional demand that a guarantee be given that no
</p>
<p>man in the factory should be discharged for having acted as a representative of his comrades.
</p>
<p>This was absolutely refused. A strike in the factory in the preceding April had been adjusted
</p>
<p>on the basis that none of the men who served on committees, etc. , and made themselves con-
</p>
<p>spicuous in behalf of their fellow workmen, would be discharged for so doing. This agreement
</p>
<p>has been wantonly violated, and every man who had incurred the displeasure of Mr. McCor-
</p>
<p>mick was not only discharged, but black-listed, in many cases being unable to obtain employ-
</p>
<p>ment in other shops.
</p>
<p>THE Me CORMICK LOCK-OUT. 113
</p>
<p>It thus appears that the Socialist leaders not only hoped to utilize the
</p>
<p>strike to precipitate their revolution, but, by purposely misstating the griev-
</p>
<p>ances of McCormick's men, to engender a bitter and violent feeling against
</p>
<p>that establishment. Now, what were the true facts in the case ? Along in
</p>
<p>February the employes in the works asked for a uniformity of wages, the
</p>
<p>re-employment, as occasion demanded, of all old hands, who had been out
</p>
<p>of work since the strike in April preceding, and the discharge of five non-
</p>
<p>union men employed in the foundry. Mr. Cyrus McCormick generously
</p>
<p>conceded the first two demands, but firmly declined to discharge the non-
</p>
<p>union men, as he regarded this as an interference with the company's right
</p>
<p>of employing whom they pleased. Thereupon the employes held a meeting
</p>
<p>and formulated an ultimatum, in which they insisted upon the discharge as
</p>
<p>requested, "not because," as they said, "they wanted to abridge the priv-
</p>
<p>ilege of hiring and discharging, but because Foreman Ward threatened to
</p>
<p>pursue old hands with such vindictiveness that he would drive them over
</p>
<p>the 'Black Road,' or else they would have to walk in their nakedness," and in
</p>
<p>justice to the old employes the non-union workmen ought to be "thrown
</p>
<p>out." Mr. McCormick took the position that this was an attempt to dictate
</p>
<p>that only union men should be employed in the works, and he finally-
</p>
<p>declared that the company had always decided and always would decide
</p>
<p>who were best suited to do its work, and whom or how many men it would
</p>
<p>employ or discharge. If the concessions already made were not satisfactory,
</p>
<p>he would close the works.
</p>
<p>During the strike of the preceding spring, McCormick had done just
</p>
<p>what other manufacturers had done in similar cases introduced new ma-
</p>
<p>chinery to perform work hitherto done by hand. He had put in new mold-
</p>
<p>ing apparatus and had found that the new machines in the hands of ordinary
</p>
<p>laborers, as soon as they learned to handle them, turned out daily far more
</p>
<p>molds and more reliable ones than the old hand process. On the outbreak
</p>
<p>of the trouble in. February there were fifteen men employed in the foundry,
</p>
<p>ten old hands and five non-union men. The services of all of them
</p>
<p>might thus have been dispensed with, since skilled labor was not necessary,
</p>
<p>and, with the addition of more machines and a few raw hands, just as much
</p>
<p>and just as good work, he claimed, might have been produced. But the

</p>
<p>owners desired to favor the employes, and, having granted a uniformity of
</p>
<p>wages even to the extent of advancing the pay of ordinary labor to $1.50
</p>
<p>per day, a sum greater than that paid by similar industries elsewhere, and
</p>
<p>having promised to give preference to old employes when additional hands
</p>
<p>were needed, they resolved not to be dictated to by outside malcontents nor
</p>
<p>to discharge men who had done efficient work for the company. The grant
</p>
<p>of such a request would, they held, be virtually placing the management of
</p>
<p>the concern in the hands of outsiders. When, therefore, the employes,
</p>
<p>instigated by the Anarchists, resolved to strike for their demand, McCormick

<p>PLANNING BLOODSHED.
</p>
<p>took time by the forelock and ordered the works closed on and after nine
</p>
<p>o'clock on the morning of February 16, to remain closed until the strikers
</p>
<p>decided to return. By this "lock-out" the employes were deprived of
</p>
<p>$3,000 a day in the shape of wages, that amount representing the daily pay-
</p>
<p>roll of the concern. Meanwhile, pending the lock-out, the company can-
</p>
<p>vassed the possibility of
</p>
<p>an early resumption of
</p>
<p>business and quietly per-
</p>
<p>fected arrangements for
</p>
<p>that step, which they con-
</p>
<p>cluded to take on March i.
</p>
<p>Of course, this contem-
</p>
<p>plated move enraged all
</p>
<p>the groups in the city.
</p>
<p>The strikers in the vicin-
</p>
<p>ity of the factory were es-
</p>
<p>pecially excited. Ever since
</p>
<p>the establishment had
</p>
<p>closed its doors the neigh-
</p>
<p>borhood had been infested
</p>
<p>with idlers and vicious-
</p>
<p>looking men. They had
</p>
<p>all felt confident that the
</p>
<p>firm would be finally
</p>
<p>forced to submit, but when
</p>
<p>it gradually dawned upon
</p>
<p>their minds that arrange-
</p>
<p>ments had actually been
</p>
<p>made for a resumption of
</p>
<p>work without reference
</p>
<p>to the wishes of the ' ' outs,"
</p>
<p>they determined to pre-
</p>
<p>vent it by force. They
</p>
<p>were the first to decide on

</p>
<p>violent measures, and they
</p>
<p>presented their purpose to the members of Carpenters' Union No. i.
</p>
<p>The result was that two secret meetings of the armed men of both
</p>
<p>unions were held between February 27 and March 3 at Greif's Hall.
</p>
<p>The first meeting called out nearly all the "armed men" of the Metal-
</p>
<p>workers' Union and about one hundred and forty men belonging to Inter-
</p>
<p>national Carpenters' Union No. i, some with rifles, revolvers and dynamite
</p>
<p>bombs. They then and there formulated a plan to prevent the "scabs"
</p>
<p>from going to work. The plan was that the metal-workers should gather
</p>
<p>GREIF'S HALL.
</p>
<p>n6 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>in the vicinity of the factory at about five o'clock on the morning the works
</p>
<p>were to be reopened, well equipped with bombs, rifles and revolvers.
</p>
<p>Those who did not possess rifles were to secure revolvers and bombs,
</p>
<p>which could be obtained, they were told, on Blue Island Avenue, between
</p>
<p>Twenty-second Street and McCormick's. At that place, on giving the
</p>
<p>pass-word and number of the place, every member would be supplied. la-
</p>
<p>the event of their running short of ammunition, they were to repair to that
</p>
<p>place, and they would find some one there always to wait on them. It was
</p>
<p>given out that the place was run by the metal-workers, who would see to
</p>
<p>it that all necessary bombs were on hand. Members having friends living
</p>
<p>in the vicinity of the factory were to stay with them over night so as to be
</p>
<p>up bright and early in the morning, and those living at a distance were to
</p>
<p>make it a point to get up early enough to be on hand at the time indicated.
</p>
<p>A point of rendezvous was designated, and, when all had arrived, they were
</p>
<p>to surround the factory and permit no one to enter except on peril of being
</p>
<p>shot. This situation of affairs, they said, would necessarily bring out the
</p>
<p>police, but the moment these should arrive the "armed men" were to open
</p>
<p>fire. The first volley was to be over the heads of the "blue-coats," and if;
</p>
<p>that did not put them to flight, they were to be shot down without mercy.
</p>
<p>When they began to throw bombs the "reds" were all to be in line, so that
</p>
<p>none of their own number would be hurt by the explosions, and wherever
</p>
<p>the police formed a company a solid front was to be presented and a
</p>
<p>rattling fire maintained. They would also form different lines along the
</p>
<p>"Black Road," and when patrol wagons came to the rescue of the officers,,
</p>
<p>they were to hurl bombs at them.
</p>
<p>It was to be a fight to the death. Every one agreed, as I was told, "to
</p>
<p>die game, give no quarter, and see to it that the green grass around
</p>
<p>McCormick's factory was nourished with human blood." In accordance
</p>
<p>with the plan, the members of the Carpenters' Union were to assemble with
</p>
<p>rifles and ammunition at Greif's Hall at an hour not later than six o'clock
</p>
<p>in the morning, and to remain there until orders for their services were
</p>
<p>sent. The carpenters carried out their part of the programme, and at the
</p>
<p>appointed hour there were no less than two hundred of them at the hall,
</p>
<p>fully armed and apparently ready for any emergency. They scattered

</p>
<p>throughout the hall building so as not to attract attention, and impatiently
</p>
<p>awaited orders or information indicating the progress of affairs at the
</p>
<p>factory. But no orders were received. They heard nothing for some
</p>
<p>time, but when they did they were a happier lot of men. The clamor and
</p>
<p>excitement of the hour had stimulated them with a false courage, but
</p>
<p>each had nevertheless entertained a secret hope that there would be no call
</p>
<p>for a display of their valor. And there was none.
</p>
<p>It appears that, on the morning they were to have created such dire
</p>
<p>destruction, the brave metal-workers overslept themselves ! " There was
</p>
<p>THE FIRST DAY'S RESULTS. 117
</p>
<p>snow on the ground," and probably they did not care to defile it with the
</p>
<p>blood of their enemies. None of them appeared at the rendezvous on time,
</p>
<p>and when they straggled around at a later hour they were full of excuses,
</p>
<p>the one on which they principally relied being that their faithful spouses
</p>
<p>had neglected to wake them in time. No one for a moment charged the
</p>
<p>others with cowardice, and yet that was the whole secret of their failure.
</p>
<p>Each had expected others to be at the appointed place ready for the fray,
</p>
<p>but the unanimity with which all had prolonged their slumbers prevented
</p>
<p>what all had expected to see a brilliant victory with themselves beyond
</p>
<p>all danger.
</p>
<p>But about the time these braves should have been around according to
</p>
<p>programme, another party occupied the field. It was the brave and fear-
</p>
<p>less Capt. Simon O'Donnell, of 'the Second Precinct, with two lieutenants
</p>
<p>and three companies of well disciplined officers. They took charge of the
</p>
<p>"Black Road" and the vicinity of McCormick's factory as early as six
</p>
<p>o'clock, and the so-called "scabs" passed into the works, "with none to
</p>
<p>molest them or make them afraid." When those who had overslept
</p>
<p>sneaked around, one after another, they were perfectly amazed. Where
</p>
<p>they had hoped to see the ground strewn with the dead bodies of police-
</p>
<p>men, they found order and serenity.
</p>
<p>In the expectation of seeing some disturbance, the vicinity became
</p>
<p>crowded during the forenoon with idlers and curious people drawn from all
</p>
<p>parts of the city. Seeing this throng and relying on the presence of many
</p>
<p>Anarchists, the daring metal-workers revived their spirits and hoped yet to
</p>
<p>precipitate a conflict by egging it on at a safe distance in the rear. They
</p>
<p>accordingly began to utter loud threats and urge the excited rabble to an
</p>
<p>attack on the "blanked bloodhounds," the police.
</p>
<p>There were in the crowd a lot of half-drunken Polanders and Bohem-
</p>
<p>ians who, living in the neighborhood, claimed that the presence of the
</p>
<p>police was a menace to their personal rights and privileges. The police
</p>
<p>were on what these misguided people considered their own reservation,
</p>
<p>and, with a view to driving them away, some began throwing stones and
</p>
<p>clubs at the officers in the patrol wagons. Others picked out officers apart
</p>
<p>from their companions and made them the targets for their missiles.

<p>Captain O'Donnell learned, while this disconcerted attack was going on,
</p>
<p>that many of the crowd had revolvers and dynamite in their pockets. He
</p>
<p>speedily resolved on a plan for arresting and disarming such men and gave
</p>
<p>orders to his lieutenants to surround the crowd and search all suspected
</p>
<p>persons. The result was that the following were found to have arms, and
</p>
<p>they were placed under arrest : Stephen Reiski, Adolph Heuman, Charles
</p>
<p>Kosh, Henry Clasen, John Hermann, George Hermann, Ernest Haker, Otto
</p>
<p>Sievert, Emil Kernser, Frank Trokinski and Stanifon Geiner. Detectives

</p>
<p>from the Central Station assisted in the search, and the offenders were
</p>
<p>taken to the Police Court, where they were fined $10 each.
</p>
<p>It was thought that this procedure would quiet the mob, but later in the
</p>
<p>day the Anarchists again gathered around McCormick's. The crowd was
</p>
<p>again surrounded, and the following were arrested for carrying concealed
</p>
<p>weapons : Louis Hartman, William Brecker, Julius Vimert, Peter Pech,
</p>
<p>William Holden, Louis Lingg, Carl Jagush, Samuel Barn, William Meyer,
</p>
<p>Rudolph Miller, John Hoben and John Otto. These were also fined.
</p>
<p>During this trouble at the factory a gang of Anarchists had gathered
</p>
<p>at the Workingmen's Hall on West Twelfth Street, and they had just
</p>
<p>formed a procession to march out in a body to McCormick's, when they
</p>
<p>were surrounded and searched. In this "round-up" the great "Little
</p>
<p>August " Krueger was arrested with a full uniform of the Lehr und Wehr
</p>
<p>Verein under an
</p>
<p>overcoat, and
</p>
<p>a
</p>
<p>number of his
</p>
<p>comrades were
</p>
<p>taken in charge at
</p>
<p>the same time.
</p>
<p>Many of them had
</p>
<p>dynamite bombs,
</p>
<p>a,nd some one
</p>
<p>shouted that "all
</p>
<p>brothers who had
</p>
<p>'stuff' should get
</p>
<p>away and the
</p>
<p>others should as-
</p>
<p>sist them."
</p>
<p>But the police
</p>
<p>were not to be
</p>
<p>trifled with, and
</p>
<p>some of the most daring officers rushed into the thickest of the crowd, and

</p>
<p>succeeded in gathering in several bombs. There were a number of women
</p>
<p>in the mob, and some of these hid bombs under their petticoats. Th5
</p>
<p>officers were of course too gallant to molest them. But the search and
</p>
<p>arrests served to break up the procession and prevent further outbreaks at
</p>
<p>the factory that day.
</p>
<p>Such were the results of the plots of the first secret meeting. The
</p>
<p>second secret gathering, a few days later, was held, as the former had been,
</p>
<p>at Greif 's Hall. It was called by the metal-workers and carpenters jointly.
</p>
<p>They were more demonstrative than ever. Gustav Belz was accorded the
</p>
<p>distinction of presiding over the turbulent members of the Carpenters'
</p>
<p>Union. All of the carpenters belonging to the Lehr und Wehr Verein,
</p>
<p>numbering one hundred and eighty men, were present with their rifles, and
</p>
<p>A "ROUND-UP. 1

</p>
<p>they were loud for war. At the same time the metal-workers had a gather-
</p>
<p>ing by themselves, and when a delegation from them called on the car-
</p>
<p>penters and announced that they were prepared to engage in battle that
</p>
<p>day, the carpenters' assemblage became delirious with excitement. They
</p>
<p>shouted and jumped about in such a lively manner that some of the more
</p>
<p>conservative members were obliged to warn them to quiet down or they
</p>
<p>would attract the attention of the police. The hot-heads, enraged at this
</p>
<p>caution, retorted by accusing the conservatives of cowardice. They refused
</p>
<p>to be quieted, and, like Comanche Indians about to take to the war-path,
</p>
<p>they examined their revolvers and brandished their guns. They even
</p>
<p>inspected the fuse on their bombs, and insisted that they would be ready
</p>
<p>the moment the command was given. In anticipation of blood, they screwed
</p>
<p>up their courage by frequent libations ; and the more they drank the happier
</p>
<p>they grew over the prospect of speedy acquisition of wealth when once their
</p>
<p>revolution was started.
</p>
<p>It was an uncomfortable place meanwhile for the conservative members,
</p>
<p>and these had frequent occasion during the stormy proceedings to regret
</p>
<p>that they had uttered a word of remonstrance. But there was one who did
</p>
<p>not allow his feelings to get the better of his judgment. It was Balthasar
</p>
<p>Rau. He took the floor and said that, however much he desired to fight
</p>
<p>and sweep McCormick and all other capitalists from the face of the earth,
</p>
<p>yet he could plainly see that the time had not yet arrived for commencing
</p>
<p>the revolution. It would be folly, he insisted, to go out on the streets with
</p>
<p>rifles in hand while all the surroundings were against them and while they
</p>
<p>were not generally prepared to cope with the police and militia. To com-
</p>
<p>mence a general upheaval now would be to destroy their prospects in the
</p>
<p>immediate future.
</p>
<p>"Before you make war," said Rau, "you must have something to fall
</p>
<p>back on ; but now we have nothing. We ought to have a treasury well
</p>
<p>filled. If we inaugurate a fight we must expect that some of us will be
</p>
<p>killed, others wounded, and others again arrested. Where is the money to
</p>
<p>help those in distress ? What will your families do if you are killed ? You
</p>
<p>must take all these things into consideration. It is very easy for us to go
</p>
<p><?ut, shoot and kill somebody, but what can we expect to gain by all that ?

</p>
<p>We must be ready and prepared and protected."
</p>
<p>This speech had a soothing effect upon some, but Belz wanted blood,
</p>
<p>and that immediately. He despised the capitalists, and the sooner their
</p>
<p>blood was spilled the better it would suit him. The majority of the meeting
</p>
<p>expressed a concurrence in Rau's ideas, and one member emphasized Rau's
</p>
<p>remarks by saying that it would be like a man going out on the streets,
</p>
<p>pounding another and then running away nothing was gained.
</p>
<p>Belz, seeing the drift of sentiment, grew very angry, and he suggested
</p>
<p>that some one move an adjournment to some other day, when they might

<p>hope to get together a braver lot of men. Such a motion was made, and
</p>
<p>the gathering separated, those that were not too drunk posting off at once
</p>
<p>for home.
</p>
<p>Belz grew quite demonstrative over the lack of results at this meeting,
</p>
<p>and avowed that he would have nothing more to do with such a crowd of

<p>cowards. A few days thereafter, however, another meeting was held ; but,
</p>
<p>in view of the many arrests Captain O'Donnell had made among their mem-
</p>
<p>bers, they were unable to decide upon any business. Some of the hot-
</p>
<p>heads threw all the blame on Rau and some of his friends for having pre-
</p>
<p>vented decisive action when they might have hoped to come out victorious.
</p>
<p>But all this sort of talk was simply braggadocio, and had any of these loud-
</p>
<p>mouthed fellows been actually tried, they would have been found skulking
</p>
<p>in the rear of an attacking party. Prior and subsequent events proved
</p>
<p>them all trembling cowards when their own personal safety was at stake.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most dangerous, because the most secret, figure in the
</p>
<p>cabal at this time was Louis Lingg. He seems to have been chosen
</p>
<p>especially to direct the revolutionary design in the southwest part of the
</p>
<p>city, and his counsels permeated every Socialistic circle in that section. In
</p>
<p>his trunk, after his arrest, the following letter was found in his own hand-
</p>
<p>writing, evidently a copy or the original of one sent :
</p>
<p>Dear Brother Union: On the occasion of the last general meeting in Zepf's Hall the
</p>
<p>International Carpenters' Union passed a resolution asking the Furniture Makers' Union if
</p>
<p>they were satisfied with the doings of their delegates, especially with Mr. Hausch and Mr.
</p>
<p>Mende, who had agreed to take the leadership of the revolution. ... It is natural that

</p>
<p>to take their rights. In consequence of these facts we feel it our duty to call the attention of

</p>
<p>and urge all to arm yourselves. Therefore, stand with all your energy against the system of
</p>

</p>
<p>Lingg likewise issued a personal address, a copy of which was also found
</p>
<p>in the trunk, urging the laborers of the Southwest Side to practice in the
</p>
<p>handling of arms. Among other things found written over his signature, is
</p>
<p>the following :
</p>
<p>Our authorized demands are replied to with clubs, powder and lead. In consequence of
</p>
<p>these experiences it is no more than right that we adopt force and arm ourselves. The
</p>
<p>opportunity to arm yourselves cheaply can be ascertained from all well-known comrades, as
</p>
<p>well as armed organization, where you can find good places to drill. Don't let this oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity pass. The medicine dynamite, in leaden bomb, is more powerful than the rifle. Don't
</p>
<p>iorget the opportunity.
</p>
<p>Lingg also sent another circular to his comrades in that section, of
</p>
<p>which the following is a copy :
</p>
<p>Brothers: As you have noticed for a long time past that the police are more than ready
</p>
<p>to break your heads with their murderous clubs and do not care whether they make you
</p>
<p>cripples for the balance of your miserable days, and do not care whether your wives and
</p>
<p>children have to go begging for you after you become useless ; neither do they care for the

<p>ing all these things into consideration, that these policemen are ready, under the instruction
</p>
<p>of the capitalists, to commit murder on the working people, I say we must resist these
</p>
<p>monsters, and the way we must do this is to get ready and be all like one man. We must

<p>fight them with as good weapons, even better than they possess, and, therefore, I call you

<p>on your minds that it is not alone enough that you have the arms ; you must also understand

<p>how to use them so that you can be equally well drilled with them as your opponents. Then-
</p>
<p>you can give them successful resistance. And now, to make this matter very easy and a
</p>
<p>success for all, the workingmen of this city, with the third company of the Lehr und Wehr
</p>
<p>Verein and some members of the International Carpenters' Union, held a meeting yesterday,
</p>
<p>and they all agreed to give lessons in drill to any one that wanted to learn how to use arms.
</p>
<p>All the people so desiring should call every Thursday evening at 8 o'clock at Turner Hall
</p>
<p>" Vorwaerts," on West Twelfth Street, and there they will receive instructions free of charge.
</p>
<p>I want you Southwest Side people to be as useful with arms as the people on the North
</p>
<p>and Northwest sides. We have everything about as complete as we wish it to be. On the-
</p>
<p>North Side we have Neff's or Thuringia Hall, No. 58 Clybourn Avenue, and you can come
</p>
<p>and visit us there and see the boys drill. We have a man named Hermann, and he is a soldier
</p>
<p>from the old home and a first-class drillmaster, and always pleased to see new recruits. Now,
</p>
<p>workingmen of the Southwest Side, I beg of you to make use of this opportunity. Do not
</p>
<p>let this go by like a dream. Remember, we are all one. It does not matter whether you are-
</p>
<p>on the South, North or West Side ; we must all fight for a purpose. Do not stay at home
</p>
<p>and let your brothers be killed when you can help them and make your cause a victory.
</p>
<p>Come in large masses, come often, come promptly. If you do this, everything will bean easy
</p>
<p>matter for us to undertake. Our labor will be rewarded. . . . The first of May is com-
</p>
<p>ing near. We will have to kill the monster. We must be ready to meet him. This is our
</p>
<p>only chance now. Probably we will not have this opportunity to meet the monster so that
</p>
<p>we can fight him with our weapons. You must kill the pirates. You must kill the blood-
</p>
<p>suckers; and for the first time in ages the poor workingmen will be made happy. Our work,
</p>
<p>is short ; we do not want a thirty years' war. Be determined. Do not let your near relation,
</p>
<p>if he is an enemy, stand in your way. Doing all this, then, the victory is ours.

</p>
<p>ADVISING VIOLENCE.
</p>
<p>123
</p>
<p>In the work of stirring up bad blood, Lingg seems to have neglected no
</p>
<p>point likely to count with the dissatisfied laborers. He knew that among the
</p>
<p>strikers were a great many German Knights of Labor, ,and, with an ingenuity
</p>
<p>worthy of a better cause, he took occasion particularly to point out an article
</p>
<p>published in the Arbeiter-Zeitung of April 22, 1886, giving Governor
</p>
<p>Oglesby's views on boycotting. This paper was afterwards found in his
</p>
<p>trunk, somewhat soiled from frequent usage, and the article in question, for
</p>
<p>convenience of reference, had been heavily marked with a lead-penciL
</p>
<p>Lingg no doubt figured that those who believed in the boycott would there-
</p>
<p>after array themselves solidly on the side of those who favored force. A
</p>
<p>translation of the Governor's remarks, as given in the Arbeiter-Zeitung, is as
</p>
<p>follows :
</p>
<p>The system of boycotting is the most damnable proposal which was ever fabricated. It
</p>
<p>repudiates the Constitution, the law and everything. It is the devil's invention. Yes (speak-
</p>
<p>ing to John V. Farwell), when it has so far progressed that the militia is obliged to interfere,
</p>
<p>you will find that these d d boycotters will come to them (the merchants and business men)-
</p>
<p>and say, ' ' You must prohibit your employes joining the militia, and those who persist in
</p>
<p>belonging must be discharged from employment, or you will be boycotted." This is a fine
</p>
<p>arrangement. It is true that, meeting with opposition all over, it will die out, but I tell you
</p>
<p>it is the most damnable transgression which was ever concocted.
</p>
<p>Parsons and Schwab also took a hand in the McCormick "lock-out,"
</p>
<p>but they used the platform to arouse the people to force. On the 2d of

<p>March a mass-meeting of Anarchists and hot-headed strikers was held at

<p>tendent of the works, and advised the use of violence against the police-
</p>
<p>J24 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>So incendiary were the speeches that E. E. Sanderson, a member of the
</p>
<p>.strikers' standing committee, took occasion to denounce the proceedings.
</p>
<p>"Such speakers," he declared, "cause every spark of sympathy to dis-
</p>
<p>appear and bring us into disrepute." If he had had the power, he said, he
</p>
<p>would have stopped the gathering. He belonged to the true laboring class,
</p>
<p>and to properly voice its sentiments he hired another hall for the next day.
</p>
<p>The continued presence of the police at the works finally restored order
</p>
<p>in the vicinity, and it seemed as if the Anarchists had abandoned any further
</p>
<p>intention of violence. But they were secretly at work, biding their time
</p>
<p>and watching their opportunity. It came on the afternoon of May 3. At
</p>
<p>this time between 40,000 and 50,000 men in Chicago were out of employ-
</p>
<p>ment by reason of the eight-hour strike. Excitement ran high throughout
</p>
<p>the city. The reaper works were now almost in full operation, and, led by
</p>
<p>the Anarchists, some of the hot-headed strikers, grown impatient over the
</p>
<p>apparent failure of their plan, made an assault upon the "scabs" at work
</p>
<p>in the shops. The instigators of this attack and the principal assailants
</p>
<p>were Anarchists, who exerted themselves to the utmost to bring on a deadly
</p>
<p>conflict between the police and the unemployed.
</p>
<p>For the day in question a meeting of the Lumber-shovers' Union had
</p>
<p>been called in the vicinity to receive the report of a committee who had
</p>
<p>waited on their employers with reference to the eight-hour question. The
</p>
<p>Socialists, learning of this, determined to make use of the opportunity.
</p>
<p>The union was composed of over six thousand lumber workingmen, three
</p>
<p>thousand Bohemians and over three thousand Germans, and had no connec-
</p>
<p>tion with the McCormick strike, but it occurred to the Central Labor Union
</p>
<p>that, inasmuch as many of them were adherents of Socialism, it would be no
</p>
<p>difficult matter to incite them to riotous demonstrations. On the day pre-
</p>
<p>ceding, Spies had been delegated by his union to address the gathering.
</p>
<p>The president of the Lumber Union, Frank Haraster, had become cogni-
</p>
<p>zant of the Anarchists' intentions, and had taken occasion to warn the men
</p>
<p>against either listening to Socialistic orators or participating in a riot. But
</p>
<p>there were mutterings of discontent, and the crowd was in a revengeful
</p>
<p>mood. There were no less than 8,600 people at the gathering some esti-

</p>
<p>"mated the number as high as 15,000. Some were intent on revolution, an'd
</p>
<p>others had been drawn to the scene through idle curiosity.
</p>
<p>It only needed a spark to create a tremendous conflagration. Anar-
</p>
<p>chists were busy among the various groups that had collected. For several
</p>
<p>days they had labored early and late in the locality to stimulate revolution-
</p>
<p>ary action. Their plans had been carefully concocted, and their network
</p>
<p>of conspiracy extended in every direction. They had opened channels of
</p>
<p>subterranean communication, and so arranged their mines of Socialistic
</p>
<p>powder that at the appointed time they hoped to produce an explosion that
</p>
<p>would reverberate throughout the globe. That appointed time, they figured,

<p>SPIES PREACHING RIOT. 125
</p>
<p>had arrived with the inauguration of the eight-hour movement, and in the
</p>
<p>lock-out at McCormick's the first opportunity was presented for a general
</p>
<p>upheaval. This was their hope and the burden of their care.
</p>
<p>When, therefore, a coterie of trained Anarchists appeared on the scene
</p>
<p>of trouble, evidently by a preconcerted arrangement, with the Nation's,
</p>
<p>flag reversed and trailing in mud and muck, the wildest excitement was
</p>
<p>aroused, and only a leader was necessary to connect the electric currents,
</p>
<p>of suppressed hostility to start an outburst of violent deeds.
</p>
<p>The occasion brought forth that leader in the person of the impulsive
</p>
<p>and impetuous Spies. He, with some trusted lieutenants, mounted a box-
</p>
<p>car in the vicinity of the meeting of the lumber-shovers and the McCor-
</p>
<p>mick works. He gathered about him an immense crowd, and, speaking in
</p>
<p>German, called the attention of his auditors to the "brutalities of capital,,
</p>
<p>its selfishness and its grinding oppression" of wage-workers, rendering
</p>
<p>their condition worse than that of slaves. With fiery invective he wrought
</p>
<p>up the feelings of the mob to a pitch of reckless frenzy. In the climaxes
</p>
<p>of his envenomed utterances, he held the multitude with a charmed spell,,
</p>
<p>and he evoked their highest plaudits when he counseled violence as a
</p>
<p>means to redress their grievances.
</p>
<p>Before the termination of this lurid speech, many hitherto apparently-
</p>
<p>apathetic had caught the infection, and when some of the non-union men
</p>
<p>emerged from the gate at the McCormick foundry, on the conclusion of
</p>
<p>their day's labor, the hour being three o'clock, many of the mob rushed
</p>
<p>to the establishment, bent on wreaking vengeance. They had hardly
</p>
<p>begun to move when some one on the box-car shouted : " Go up and kill
</p>
<p>the d d scabs ! " The identity of this person has never been disclosed,.
</p>
<p>but it is no rash conclusion to suppose that it was a confidant of Spies, as-
</p>
<p>well as of Lingg, who had secret charge of fomenting disturbances in that
</p>
<p>district. Lingg was present at this gathering, and, as he subsequently
</p>
<p>claimed that he had been clubbed by the police in the riot that followed,,
</p>
<p>he may possibly have raised the cry himself.
</p>
<p>The mob reached the works in short order, hurling stones and firing
</p>

<p>The non-union men, seeing the approaching mob, took to flight, some
</p>
<p>seeking shelter in the works and others scampering across the prairie
</p>
<p>beyond reach. There were at this time only two policemen on duty. One
</p>
<p>of them, J. A. West, endeavored to pacify the crowd, but received in
</p>
<p>response bricks and mud. The other for awhile, as well as he could, held
</p>
<p>the mob at bay at the gate. West finally worked his way through the
</p>
<p>crowd to a patrol box, and turned in an alarm for reinforcements. Mean-
</p>
<p>while the mob disported itself in throwing stones and firing revolvers, and
</p>
<p>finally forced an entrance through the gate to the yards.
</p>
<p>Presently a patrol wagon loaded with officers plowed through the tur-
</p>
<p>126

</p>
<p>bulent mass, and, securing the ground between the mob and the buildings,
</p>
<p>began driving out and dispersing the rioters. This only served to infuriate
</p>
<p>the Anarchists, who fired in the direction of the police and hurled a shower
</p>
<p>of stones. The officers remonstrated in vain, warning the mob to keep
</p>
<p>back, and finally made a rush upon the rioters with revolvers drawn, shoot-
</p>
<p>ing right and left.
</p>
<p>The crowd swayed to and fro, retreated slightly, then rallied again, and,
</p>
<p>diverging to either side in a jumbled but compact body, seemed bent on
</p>
<p>CHARGING THE MOB.
</p>
<p>holding their ground and fighting for every inch of it. But the dashing and
</p>
<p>aggressive movements of the police, backed by courage and discipline, soon
</p>
<p>demonstrated to the howling rabble the hopelessness of the struggle. The
</p>
<p>very air seemed charged with bullets, clubs and missiles. Revolvers clicked
</p>
<p>furiously, the exigencies of the moment necessitating their use on
</p>
<p>the part of the police, and several revolutionists bit the dust, maimed and
</p>
<p>wounded. What seems strange is that none were killed in this furious
</p>
<p>onslaught.
</p>
<p>The mob, which numbered fully 8,000, was soon put to precipitate flight.

<p>Some of the most vicious leaders, however, kept up a rattling fire of guns,

<p>127
</p>
<p>revolvers, brickbats and sticks so long as their retreat was measurably
</p>
<p>covered by the fleeing mob surrounding them. Several of these leaders,
</p>
<p>with their weapons still smoking, were subsequently overtaken, disarmed
</p>
<p>and locked up.
</p>
<p>During all this short affray, Spies was nowhere to be seen, but, the
</p>
<p>moment all danger seemed past, he emerged from his seclusion, breathing
</p>
<p>courage and vengeance. He bounded into the field like one ready to
</p>
<p>sacrifice himself for his cause, but cautiously kept himself where no stray
</p>
<p>bullets might reach him. Another singular feature in connection with the
</p>
<p>part he played in the affair was his attempt to parade his own heroic virtues,
</p>
<p>by implication, in the denunciations and upbraidings he heaped upon his
</p>
<p>comrades in the account published of the riot on the very afternoon after
</p>
<p>its occurrence. This
</p>
<p>is what he said in
</p>
<p>the Arbeiter-Zeitung:
</p>
<p>The writer of this
</p>
<p>hastened to the factory
</p>
<p>as soon as the first shots
</p>
<p>were fired, and a com-
</p>
<p>rade urged the assembly
</p>
<p>to hasten to the rescue
</p>
<p>of their brothers, who
</p>
<p>were being murdered,
</p>
<p>but none stirred. . . .
</p>
<p>The writer ran back. He
</p>
<p>implored the people to
</p>
<p>come along, those who
</p>
<p>had revolvers in their
</p>
<p>pockets, but it was in
</p>
<p>vain. With an exasper-
</p>
<p>ating indifference they

</p>
<p>pockets and marched home, babbling as if the whole affair did not concern them in the
</p>
<p>least. The revolvers were still cracking, and fresh detachments of police, here and there
</p>
<p>bombarded with stones, were hastening to the battle-ground. The battle was lost !
</p>
<p>A riot on a smaller scale occurred shortly after this in another locality,
</p>
<p>instigated by the Anarchists who had been so severely repulsed in the
</p>
<p>afternoon. After the McCormick outbreak one of the wounded strikers
</p>
<p>was taken in a patrol wagon to the Twelfth Street Station, and thence to his
</p>
<p>home on Seventeenth Street. Officer Casey was one of the men in charge
</p>
<p>of the wagon, and remained behind at the house to take a report of the
</p>
<p>man's name, his residence and the nature of his injuries. When the
</p>
<p>officer came out of the wounded man's home, he was set upon by a mob,
</p>
<p>shouting :
</p>
<p>"Hang him ! Hang the blue-coat ! "
</p>
<p>A Bohemian, named Vaclav Djenek, cried out:
</p>
<p>OFFICER CASEY'S PERIL.
</p>
<p>128
</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>"Help me ; help me to hang the canaille!"
</p>
<p>Two or three came to his side and endeavored to execute the threat.
</p>
<p>Casey by a great effort managed to get away, and started on a run. Pistol
</p>
<p>shots were fired after him by the mob, but fortunately he escaped without
</p>
<p>injury.
</p>
<p>A patrol wagon from the West Chicago Avenue Station had mean-
</p>
<p>while been telephoned for by some peace-loving citizens, and it rapidly
</p>
<p>dashed up to the scene of disturbance.
</p>
<p>The officers saw the whole situation,
</p>
<p>dispersed the mob, and set about
</p>
<p>arresting the parties who had so
</p>
<p>nearly succeeded in hanging the offi-
</p>
<p>cer. They found that it had been a
</p>
<p>very close call for Casey, that the rope
</p>
<p>was ready, and that, had it not been
</p>
<p>for his own Herculean efforts, he
</p>
<p>would have dangled from a lamp-
</p>
<p>post in a very few seconds.
</p>
<p>Djenek, who was afterwards rec-
</p>
<p>ognized as the principal actor in
</p>
<p>this episode, was run down and
</p>
<p>placed under arrest. He was tried
</p>
<p>and sentenced to one year in the
</p>
<p>penitentiary. During the trial two

<p>NEVER was that old saying, "Whom the gods wish to destroy they

<p>first make mad," better illustrated than in the actions of the Anar-
</p>
<p>chist leaders after their desperate exploits at McCormick's Works. That
</p>
<p>riot was to have been the pivotal point in their social revolution. It
</p>
<p>turned out a humiliating fiasco. They had hoped to make a coup d'ttat for
</p>
<p>the scarlet banner and had counted upon such a victory as would terrorize
</p>
<p>Capital, appal the people and paralyze the arm of constituted authority.
</p>
<p>When they discovered that the police had escaped with only slight bruises,
</p>
<p>that some of their own comrades had been seriously wounded and that
</p>
<p>even the so-called "scabs" had passed through the onslaught with noth-
</p>
<p>ing worse than fright, their rage knew no bounds. They saw that " the
</p>
<p>battle had been lost," and prompt, energetic action seemed necessary to
</p>
<p>retrieve the situation.
</p>
<p>Spies, their recognized leader, while the perspiration still dripped from
</p>
<p>his face, and his blood still fired by his speech to the strikers and his
</p>
<p>" heroic efforts " to rally the routed and fleeing Socialists, seized a pen,
</p>
<p>and, dipping it into the gall of his indignation, wrote what subsequently
</p>
<p>became famous as the "Revenge Circular." It was printed in German
</p>
<p>and English, and an exact fac-simile is presented herewith. The German
</p>
<p>version is somewhat different from the English, being addressed to the
</p>
<p>adherents of Anarchy and Socialism, the English version seeming to have
</p>
<p>been intended for Americans in general. Several thousand copies were

</p>
<p>scattered throughout the city.
</p>
<p>The wording of the English portion of the circular may be seen in the
</p>
<p>illustration. The German portion, translated, reads as follows :

<p>Revenge ! Revenge ! Workmen to arms !
</p>
<p>Men of labor, this afternoon the bloodhounds of your oppressors murdered six of your
</p>
<p>brothers at McCormick's. Why did they murder them ? Because they dared to be dissatis-
</p>

</p>
<p>they gave them lead for an answer, mindful of the fact that thus people are most effectually

<p>Not content with this, Spies also wrote and published, in the Arbeiter-

<p>Zeitung of May 4, the following :

</p>
<p>yesterday have been possible had that advice been followed ? Yesterday, at McCormick's
</p>
<p>factory, so far as can now be ascertained, four workmen were killed and twenty-five more or
</p>
<p>less seriously wounded. If members who defended themselves with stones (a few of them
</p>
<p>had little snappers in the shape of revolvers) had been provided with good weapons and one
</p>
<p>single dynamite bomb, not one of the murderers would have escaped his well-merited fate.
</p>
<p>This massacre was to fill the workmen of this city with fear. Will it succeed ?
</p>
<p>A meeting of the lumber employes was held yesterday at the Black Road to appoint a
</p>
<p>committee to wait on the committee of the owners and present the demands agreed upon.
</p>
<p>It was an immense meeting. Several speeches were made in English, German and Polish.
</p>
<p>Finally Mr. Spies was introduced, when a Pole cried, "That is a Socialist," and great dis-
</p>
<p>approbation was expressed, but the speaker continued, telling them that they must realize
</p>
<p>their strength, and must not recede from their demands ; that the issue lay in their hands,
</p>
<p>and needed only resolution on their part.
</p>
<p>At this point some one cried, "On to McCormick's! Let us drive off the scabs," and
</p>
<p>about two hundred ran toward McCormick's. The speaker, not knowing what occurred,
</p>
<p>continued his speech, and was appointed afterwards a member of the committee to notify
</p>
<p>the bosses of the action.
</p>
<p>Then a Pole spoke, when a patrol wagon rushed up to McCormick's, and the crowd began
</p>
<p>to break up. Shortly shots were heard near McCormick's factory, and about seventy-five
</p>
<p>well-fed, large and strong murderers, under command of a fat police lieutenant, marched by,
</p>
<p>followed by three more patrol wagons full of law and order beasts. Two hundred police
</p>
<p>were there in less than ten minutes, firing on fleeing workingmen and women. The writer
</p>
<p>hastened to the factory, while a comrade urged the assembly to rescue their brothers,
</p>
<p>unavailingly. A young Irishman said to the writer: "What miserable ( ) are those
</p>
<p>who will not turn a hand while their brothers are being shot down in cold blood ! We have
</p>
<p>dragged away two. I think they are dead. If you have any influence with the people,
</p>
<p>for Heaven's sake, run back and urge them to follow you." The writer did so in vain.
</p>
<p>The revolvers were still cracking ; fresh policemen arriving ; and the battle was lost. It
</p>
<p>was about half-past three that the little crowd from the meeting reached McCormick's
</p>
<p>factory. Policeman West tried to hold them back with his revolver, but was put to
</p>
<p>flight with a shower of stones and roughly handled. The crowd bombarded the factory
</p>
<p>windows with stones and demolished the guard-house. The scabs were in mortal terror,
</p>
<p>when the Hinman Street patrol wagon arrived. They were about to attack the crowd with

</p>
<p>their clubs, when a shower of stones was thrown, followed the next minute by the firing by
</p>
<p>the police upon the strikers. It was pretended subsequently that they fired over their heads.
</p>
<p>The strikers had a few revolvers and returned the fire. Meantime, more police arrived, and
</p>
<p>then the whole band opened fire on the people. The people fought with stones, and are said
</p>
<p>to have disabled four policemen. The gang, as always, fired upon the fleeing, while women
</p>
<p>and men carried away the severely wounded. How many were injured cannot be told. A
</p>
<p>dying boy, Joseph Doebick, was brought home on an express wagon by two policemen. Tin
</p>
<p>crowd threatened to lynch the officer, but were prevented by a patrol wagon. Various
</p>
<p>strikers were arrested. McCormick said that "August Spies made a speech to a few thousand
</p>
<p>Anarchists and then put himself at the head of a crowd and attacked our works. Our
</p>
<p>workmen fled, and meantime the police came and sent a lot of Anarchists away with bleeding
</p>
<p>heads."
</p>
<p>Mark well the language, seeking to inflame the minds of the Socialists
</p>
<p>by maliciously stating that four men had been killed, when in fact not one
</p>
<p>was fatally injured, its bitter invective, its cunning phraseology, its rude
</p>
<p>eloquence and its passionate appeal. All were well calculated to stir up
</p>
<p>revengeful feelings at a time when public sentiment ran high throughout the
</p>

</p>
<p>city. The events following close upon the heels of the eight-hour strike
</p>
<p>were critical in the extreme, and none knew the exact situation better than
</p>
<p>the Anarchist leaders. Their course had been shaped with special reference
</p>
<p>to it. Their secret plottings were directed by the events of the hour. The
</p>
<p>time had come, they felt, when the Commune should be proclaimed. It
</p>
<p>would not do, they urged,
</p>
<p>to let the opportunity pass.
</p>
<p>The failure of the McCor-
</p>
<p>mick riot at once suggested
</p>
<p>retaliation in a manner best
</p>
<p>known to themselves, and
</p>
<p>the circular was fulminated

<p>with a clear knowledge that

<p>no misdirected effort, and
</p>
<p>that all might be properly
</p>
<p>instructed for the emer-
</p>
<p>gency, it was deemed best
</p>
<p>to hold a secret conference.
</p>
<p>The hour seemed to have
</p>
<p>arrived when their armed
</p>
<p>sections, the various groups
</p>
<p>of the order trained in the
</p>
<p>use of guns and explosives,
</p>
<p>should be brought into
</p>
<p>requisition, and the police
</p>
<p>in particular and the public
</p>
<p>in general be made to feel
</p>
<p>their power. How best to
</p>
<p>accomplish this purpose had
</p>
<p>been uppermost in their
</p>
<p>minds from the moment of their disaster at the reaper works. A conflict
</p>
<p>between the police and the strikers had been counted upon as a certainty
</p>
<p>under their inspiration, and plans looking to the best means of taking
</p>
<p>advantage of this strike as well as the eight-hour strike had been dis-
</p>
<p>cussed even before the McCormick riot.
</p>
<p>Only so short a time as the day before that event, the members of the
</p>

<p>EN GEL'S BLOODY PLAN. 133
</p>
<p>considered the probabilities in view of the eight-hour movement. They
</p>
<p>clearly foresaw a conflict, and, among other things, discussed a plan to
</p>
<p>meet that contingency. This plan, proposed by Engel and indorsed by
</p>
<p>Fischer, and subsequently confessed by one of the conspirators present at
</p>
<p>that meeting, was that whenever it came to a conflict between the police
</p>
<p>and the Northwest groups, bombs should be thrown into the police stations.
</p>
<p>The riflemen of the Lehr und Wehr Verein should post themselves in line
</p>
<p>at a certain distance, and whoever came out of the stations should be shot
</p>
<p>down. They would then come into the heart of the city, where the fight
</p>
<p>would commence in earnest. The members of the Northwest Side groups
</p>
<p>were counseled to mutually assist each other in making the attack upon
</p>
<p>the -police, and "if any one had anything with him, he should use it." "As
</p>
<p>the police would endeavor to subdue the workingmen by sending all their
</p>
<p>available force to the place of attack, the Anarchists could easily blow up
</p>
<p>the stations, and such officers as might effect an escape from the buildings
</p>
<p>could be killed by their riflemen. Then they would cut the telegraph
</p>
<p>wires so as to prevent communication with other stations, after which they
</p>
<p>would proceed to the nearest station and destroy that. On their way they
</p>
<p>would throw fire bombs at some of the buildings, and this would call out the
</p>
<p>Fire Department and prevent the firemen from being called upon to quell
</p>
<p>the riot. While proceeding thus they would secure reinforcements, and, in
</p>
<p>the intense excitement following, the police as well as militia would become
</p>
<p>confused and divided in counsel as to the points where they could do the
</p>
<p>most effective service. The attacks should be almost simultaneous in dif-
</p>
<p>ferent parts of the city at a given signal. When they all finally reached
</p>
<p>the center of the city, they would set fire to the most prominent buildings
</p>
<p>and attack the jail, open the doors and set free the inmates to join them in
</p>
<p>future movements."
</p>
<p>This plan, it is almost needless to remark, was unanimously adopted.
</p>
<p>But concerted action was necessary among all the groups, and in view of
</p>
<p>the " skull-cracking," to use their own phrase, on the afternoon of May 3, a
</p>
<p>secret conference of all groups was determined upon as a supplement to
</p>
<p>Spies' pronunciamento and as an incitement to future revolutionary move-

<p>ments. A notice understood by all in the armed sections " Y, come
</p>
<p>Monday evening" was inserted in the Arbeiter-Zeitung. The commander
</p>
<p>of the Lehr und Wehr Verein rented a beer basement at No. 54 West
</p>
<p>Lake Street, known to the followers of Socialism as Greif's Hall, and along
</p>
<p>towards eight o'clock representatives of all the armed sections of the
</p>
<p>Internationale gathered there. In order that the utmost privacy might be
</p>
<p>maintained, guards were posted both at the front and rear entrances with
</p>
<p>instructions to permit no one to stand on the outside and to admit only
</p>
<p>trusted adherents. '
</p>
<p>1 34 A NAR CHY AND ANAR CHISTS.
</p>
<p>When the session opened there were between seventy and eighty mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the various sections present. Their deliberations were presided
</p>
<p>over by Gottfried Waller, who subsequently became an important witness
</p>
<p>for the State.
</p>
<p>Spies' " Revenge circular," written late that afternoon, was distributed
</p>
<p>in the meeting, and its sentiments were heartily seconded by all present.
</p>
<p>Engel finally submitted the plan already given, and some discussion followed,
</p>
<p>participated in by various members. Fischer considered the plan admir-
</p>
<p>able, and, lest there might be evidence of weakness, he stated that if any man
</p>
<p>acted the part of a coward, his own dagger or a bullet from his rifle should
</p>
<p>pierce that man's heart. Inquiries being made with reference to a supply
</p>
<p>of bombs, he suggested that the members manufacture them on their own
</p>
<p>account. The best thing, he said, was to procure a tin coffee-bottle, fill it
</p>
<p>with benzine, attach a cap and fuse, and they would have a most effective
</p>
<p>bomb.
</p>
<p>Engel's plan went through with a rush. Having now agreed upon a
</p>
<p>definite course, it was necessary to adopt a signal to warn the sections of
</p>
<p>danger and summon them to action. Fischer was equal to the occasion.
</p>
<p>He proposed the German word " Ruhe," signifying "rest" or "peace,"
</p>
<p>and added that whenever it should appear in the "Letterbox" column of
</p>
<p>the Arbeiter-Zeitung, all would know that the moment for decisive action
</p>
<p>had been reached, and that all were expected to repair promptly to their
</p>
<p>appointed meeting-places, fully armed and ready for duty. The suggestion
</p>
<p>was adopted.
</p>
<p>But what are plans without being fortified by enthusiasm on the part of
</p>
<p>the mob expected to carry them out ? The Socialistic heart must be fired
</p>
<p>to a proper pitch of frenzy. Every soul must be made to feel that the
</p>
<p>cause of Socialism is his own. A mass-meeting was just the thing, and a
</p>
<p>mass-meeting it was decided by this august band of conspirators to call.
</p>
<p>The time was the only point in controversy. The chairman insisted on
</p>
<p>holding it the following morning on Market Square, which is a widening of
</p>
<p>Market Street between Madison and Randolph Streets, but Fischer pro-
</p>
<p>tested, because, as he said, it was a. " mouse trap," and insisted that the

</p>
<p>meeting be held in the evening, when they could bring out a crowd of no
</p>
<p>less than 25,000 people, and that the Haymarket be the place. There, he
</p>
<p>said, they would have greater security in case of disturbance, and more and
</p>
<p>better means of escape. His counsel finally prevailed, and after a call had
</p>
<p>been suitably drafted, Fischer was intrusted with its printing.
</p>
<p>Remembering that "what is everybody's business is nobody's business,"
</p>
<p>the meeting decided to appoint a committee, consisting of one or two
</p>
<p>members from each group. This committee was to keep a close watch on all
</p>
<p>movements that might be made at Haymarket Square and in different parts
</p>
<p>of the city, and, in the event of a conflict, to promptly report it to the
</p>

</p>
<p>inating the sky with a red light at night. If either signal could not be
</p>
<p>conveniently used, then they were to notify the members individually.
</p>
<p>Before the conclusion of this secret conclave, every one present was
</p>
<p>directed to notify absent
</p>
<p>members of what had been
</p>
<p>done, and Rudolph Schnau-
</p>
<p>belt, who has since been
</p>
<p>proven the thrower of the
</p>
<p>bomb which scattered death
</p>
<p>and devastation on the
</p>
<p>following evening, wished
</p>
<p>to go even further and have
</p>
<p>Socialists in other cities noti-
</p>
<p>fied so that the proposed rev-
</p>
<p>olution might become gen-
</p>
<p>eral. The instigators of the
</p>
<p>meeting just described were
</p>
<p>Spies, Parsons, Fielden and
</p>
<p>Neebe, but for some reason
</p>
<p>they failed to put in an ap-
</p>
<p>pearance.
</p>
<p>In accordance with ar-
</p>
<p>rangements, the call for the
</p>
<p>mass-meeting was printed
</p>
<p>the next morning. There
</p>
<p>were two versions of this

<p>call. Fac-similes of both are

<p>THE CALL FOR THE HAYMARKET MEETING. II.

</p>
<p>4 the signal word "Ruhe"
</p>
<p>appeared in the Arbeiter-
</p>
<p>Zeitung, and all the armed
</p>
<p>men proceeded to place
</p>
<p>themselves in readiness for the conflict. They also devoted themselves
</p>
<p>energetically to cultivating revengeful sentiments. While making their prep-
</p>
<p>arations for the projected riot, they communicated the plan decided upon
</p>
<p>to every member of the order, and all were urged to come fully armed with
</p>
<p>such weapons as they might possess.
</p>
<p>But their greatest reliance was placed in the use of dynamite. This
</p>
<p>highly explosive material was regarded as the chief arm of their cause.
</p>
<p>For many weeks, the leaders had experimented with it. Some six week?

</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>before the disastrous Haymarket riot, Louis Lingg had brought a bomb to
</p>
<p>the house of William Seliger, No. 442 Sedgwick Street, where he boarded,
</p>
<p>and announced his intention of making other bombs like it. Before this
</p>
<p>he had provided himself with dynamite, the money for its purchase having
</p>
<p>been realized at a ball given some time previously and turned over to him
</p>
<p>to use in experiments. Being out of employment at the time, he devoted
</p>
<p>himself energetically to experiments with that material, and produced
</p>
<p>large gas-pipe bombs. One of these he took out to a grove north of the
</p>
<p>city, and, placing
</p>
<p>it in the crotch of
</p>
<p>a tree, exploded
</p>
<p>it, splitting the
</p>
<p>tree to pieces. The
</p>
<p>result of the test
</p>
<p>appears to have
</p>
<p>been satisfactory,
</p>
<p>and he next gave
</p>
<p>hisattentiontothe
</p>
<p>manufacture of
</p>
<p>globular shells. In
</p>
<p>the casting of
</p>
<p>these he used the
</p>
<p>kitchen stove to
</p>
<p>melt his metal,
</p>
<p>and often receiv-
</p>
<p>ed the assistance
</p>
<p>of Seliger, Thielen
</p>
<p>and Hermann. All
</p>
<p>day Tuesday, May
</p>
<p>4, he worked most
</p>
<p>persistently and
</p>
<p>seemed in a great

</p>
<p>hurry to make as
</p>
<p>many bombs as possible. He was helped on that day by the parties named
</p>
<p>and two others, Hueber and Munzenberger. Before the close of the day
</p>
<p>they had finished over a hundred bombs. While they were at work Lehman
</p>
<p>visited them and carried home a satchel of dynamite, which he subse-
</p>
<p>quently, after the Haymarket riot, buried out on the prairie, and which
</p>
<p>was afterwards disinterred by the police. Not alone did he and his friends
</p>
<p>experiment with dynamite, but it appears that Spies, Parsons, Fischer,
</p>
<p>Fielden and Schwab also tried their hands at it and handled the deadly
</p>
<p>stuff at the office of the Arbeiter-Zeitung. They had several bombs there
</p>
<p>and made no secret of the purpose for which they intended them. The office
</p>
<p>was afterwards discovered to be an arsenal of revolvers and dynamite.
</p>
<p>NEFF'S HALL.
</p>
<p>FORCING THE REVOLUTION. 137
</p>
<p>After the bombs had been completed by Lingg and his assistants, Lingg
</p>
<p>and Seliger put them in a trunk or satchel and carried them over towards
</p>
<p>Neff's Hall, at No. 58 Clybourn Avenue. On the way they were met by
</p>
<p>Munzenberger, who took the trunk, and, placing it on his shoulder, carried it
</p>
<p>the rest of the distance. At this time it being evening there was a meet-
</p>
<p>ing of painters in a hall at the rear of Neff's saloon, and the package was
</p>
<p>placed at the entrance for a moment's exhibition. Lingg asked the pro-
</p>
<p>prietor if any one had called and inquired for him, and, on being answered
</p>
<p>in the negative, proceeded with Seliger and Munzenberger into the hall-
</p>
<p>way connecting the saloon and the assembly-room. Placing the trunk on
</p>
<p>the floor, he opened it for inspection. Several parties examined the
</p>
<p>bombs and took some of them away. Seliger helped himself to two and
</p>
<p>kept them until after the Haymarket explosion, when he hid them under a
</p>
<p>sidewalk on Sigel Street. Lingg, Seliger and Munzenberger then left the
</p>
<p>premises. The direction the last-named took is a matter in doubt. Neff
</p>
<p>had never seen him before,- Lehman did not know him, and Seliger had not
</p>
<p>even learned his name.
</p>
<p>It is clear that all this work was part of the conspiracy concocted at
</p>
<p>Greif's Hall the previous evening. It is also well settled that Munzen-
</p>
<p>berger was the chosen agent to secure the bombs and see that they were
</p>
<p>placed in the hands of trusted Anarchists for use at the proper moment.
</p>
<p>The secrecy surrounding the latter's identity was in complete accord with
</p>
<p>the method of procedure outlined in the instructions given to Socialists :
</p>
<p>In the commission of a deed, a comrade who does not live at the place of action, that is,
</p>
<p>a comrade of some other place, ought, if possibility admits, to participate in the action, or,
</p>
<p>formulated difficulty, a revolutionary deed ought to be enacted where one is not known.
</p>
<p>Still further steps were taken to precipitate the revolution. In con-
</p>
<p>formity with the Monday night plan, armed men were to be stationed, on
</p>
<p>the evening of Tuesday, in the vicinity of the police stations. We find
</p>
<p>that Lingg, Seliger, Lehman, Smidke, Thielen and two large unknown men
</p>
<p>were in the vicinity of the North Avenue Station. They skulked about the
</p>
<p>corners of the streets leading to that station, between eight and ten o'clock,
</p>
<p>fully armed with bombs and ready for desperate deeds. Others, who had

</p>
<p>secured bombs at Neff's Hall, went further northward and hovered around
</p>
<p>the police station near the corner of Webster and Lincoln Avenues.
</p>
<p>Seliger and Lingg also paid that vicinity a visit. There were also armed
</p>
<p>men at Deering, where a meeting of striking workingmen was held, and
</p>
<p>which was addressed by Schwab after he had left the Haymarket. Anar-
</p>
<p>chists also posted themselves in the vicinity of the Chicago Avenue Station.
</p>
<p>Men were also near the North Avenue Station, and some twenty-five posted
</p>
<p>themselves at the corner of Halsted and Randolph Streets, two blocks
</p>
<p>from the Desplaines Street Station. Spies and Schwab entered this group
</p>
<p>138 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>and held some secret consultation with the leaders. Fischer and Waller
</p>
<p>were also close to that station.
</p>
<p>It furthermore appears that several men called on Tuesday evening at
</p>
<p>Waller's residence while he was eating his supper and desired him to
</p>
<p>accompany them to Wicker Park, saying that they "wanted to be at their
</p>
<p>post." Two of these men were Krueger and Kraemer, belonging to the
</p>
<p>"armed sections." Some men also called at Engel's store, and one of them
</p>
<p>exhibited a revolver. Another, a stranger, explained to a comrade that he
</p>
<p>was waiting for some " pills." He waited only five minutes, when a young
</p>
<p>girl about ten or twelve years of age came in, carrying a mysterious package.
</p>
<p>This she handed to the stranger, who stepped behind a screen and then
</p>
<p>hastened out.
</p>
<p>It is thus manifest that the various parties were bent on a carnival of
</p>
<p>riot and destruction and only awaited the proper signal from the commit-
</p>
<p>tee. The men intrusted with the secrets of pillage, murder and general
</p>
<p>destruction belonged to what was known in the order as the " Revolution-
</p>
<p>ary Group." The plan was not communicated to any one else. The utmost
</p>
<p>secrecy had to be maintained for its successful accomplishment, and the
</p>
<p>conspiracy was only communicated to such as had proved themselves in
</p>
<p>the past, by word and deed, in full accord with revolutionary methods.
</p>
<p>The "revolutionary party " consisted of the Lehr und Wehr Verein, com-
</p>
<p>manded by Breitenfeld ; the Northwest Side group, under command of
</p>
<p>Engel, Fischer and Grumm ; the North Side group, commanded by Neebe,
</p>
<p>Lingg and Hermann ; the American group, commanded by Spies, Parsons
</p>
<p>and Fielden ; the Karl Marx group, directed by Schilling ; the Freiheit
</p>
<p>group and the armed sections of the International Carpenters' Union and
</p>
<p>Metal-workers' Union. These various sections, or groups, were under the
</p>
<p>management of a general committee which included among its leading
</p>
<p>spirits Spies, Schwab, Parsons, Neebe, Rau, Hirschberger, Deusch and Belz.
</p>
<p>This committee met at stated periods at the office of the Arbeiter-Zeitung
</p>
<p>and formulated orders for the guidance of the groups. Its expenses were
</p>
<p>met by monthly contributions from all the Socialistic societies. It was
</p>
<p>under the inspiration of this committee that the Monday night meeting

</p>
<p>was held. Why the signal for a concerted raid on the police stations, the
</p>
<p>burning of buildings and the slaughter of capitalists was not given on the
</p>
<p>fateful night of the Haymarket riot, or, if given, as seems to be believed in
</p>
<p>many quarters, in Fielden's declaration, "We are peaceable," why it was
</p>
<p>not carried out completely, is not explicable upon any other hypothesis
</p>
<p>than that the courage of the trusted leaders failed them at the critical

<p>moinent.

</p>
<p>WITH such active work among the conspirators as I have shown, it
</p>
<p>was only a question of time when some terrible catastrophe would
</p>
<p>ensue through the instrumentality of the powerful bombs they had manu-
</p>
<p>factured. The public mind was in a state of fear and suspense, not:
</p>
<p>knowing the direction whence threatened devastation and destruction might
</p>
<p>appear. The incendiary speeches were enough to excite trepidation, and
</p>
<p>the appearance of the "Revenge circular" fanned the excitement into-
</p>
<p>general alarm and indignation. The McCormick attack proved conclusively
</p>
<p>that the Anarchists meant to practice what they preached. After their
</p>
<p>rout and defeat, they were heard to express regret that they had not
</p>
<p>taken forcible possession of the works before the arrival of the police and
</p>
<p>then received the officers with a volley of fire-arms, as had once been con-
</p>
<p>templated in a star-chamber session of one of their ' revolutionary groups."
</p>
<p>The air was full of rumors, and the general public was convinced that some:
</p>
<p>great disaster would occur unless the police promptly forbade the holding
</p>
<p>of further revolutionary meetings. The Mayor's attention had been called
</p>
<p>to the possible results if such meetings were permitted to continue, and.
</p>
<p>he, in turn, directed the Police Department to keep close watch of the
</p>
<p>gathering called for the Haymarket Square and disperse it in case the
</p>
<p>speakers used inflammatory language. During the day many of the Spies,
</p>
<p>circulars had been distributed in the vicinity of the McCormick establish-
</p>
<p>ment, and it was expected that many of the enraged strikers from that
</p>
<p>locality would attend the meeting. It was clear that, in view of the temper
</p>
<p>of the Socialists, only slight encouragement would be required to produce
</p>
<p>a disturbance, and it was of the utmost importance that prompt action
</p>
<p>should be taken at the first sign of trouble. It subsequently transpired

<p>that the leaders had intended to make the speeches threatening in order to-
</p>
<p>invite a charge upon the crowd by the police, and then, during the con-
</p>
<p>fusion, to carry out the Monday night programme.
</p>
<p>The city authorities fully comprehended the situation, but concluded
</p>
<p>not to interfere with the meeting unless the discussion should be attended
</p>
<p>with violent threats. In order to be prepared for any emergency, however,,
</p>
<p>it was deemed best to concentrate a large force in the vicinity of the meet-

<p>The meeting had been called for 7:30 o'clock, and at that hour quite a
</p>
<p>number had assembled in the vicinity of Haymarket Square. This square:
</p>
<p>is simply a widening of Randolph Street between Desplaines and Halsted.
</p>
<p>Streets; and in years past was used by farmers for the sale of hay and
</p>
<p>produce. It was for this place that the call had been issued, but for certain
</p>
<p>reasons the meeting was held ninety feet north of Randolph, on Desplaines
</p>
<p>Street, near the intersection of an alley which has since passed into public
</p>
<p>fame as "Crane's alley." In sight almost of this alley was Zepf's Hall, on
</p>
<p>the northeast corner of Lake and Desplaines Streets, and about two blocks,
</p>
<p>further east on Lake Street were Florus' Hall and Greif's Hall all notor-
</p>
<p>ious resorts and headquarters for Anarchists. On the evening in question
</p>
<p>these places and surrounding streets leading to the meeting-place were
</p>
<p>crowded with strikers and Socialist sympathizers, some within the saloons,
</p>
<p>regaling themselves with beer and some jostling each other on the thorough-
</p>
<p>fares, either going for liquids or returning to the meeting after having for the
</p>
<p>moment satisfied the "inner man." Here was a condition of things that
</p>
<p>would permit an easy mingling in. and ready escape through, the crowd, in
</p>
<p>the event of inauguration of the revolutionary plan adopted the evening
</p>
<p>previous. The throngs would serve as a cover for apparently safe opera-
</p>
<p>tions. Another advantage gained by holding the meeting at the point
</p>
<p>indicated was that the street was dimly lighted, and, as the building in front
</p>
<p>of which the speaking took place was a manufacturing establishment,
</p>
<p>that of Crane Bros., not used or lighted at night, and as the alley con-

</p>
<p>tiguous to the speaker's stand formed an L with another alley leading to-
</p>
<p>Randolph Street, there were points of seeming safety for a conflict with the
</p>
<p>police. Besides, the point was about 350 feet north of the Desplaines
</p>
<p>Street Police Station, and it was evidently calculated that when the police
</p>
<p>should attack the crowd, that part of the Monday night programme about
</p>
<p>blowing up the stations could easily be carried into effect.
</p>
<p>These were the undoubted reasons for effecting the change. The reader
</p>
<p>will remember that one of the objections urged by Fischer against holding
</p>
<p>the meeting on Market Square was that it was a "mouse trap," and one of
</p>
<p>his potential arguments for the Haymarket was that it was a safer place

<p>THE HAYMARKET MEETING.
</p>
<p>for the execution of their plot. There was thus a " method in their mad-
</p>
<p>ness." All the contingencies had evidently been very carefully considered.
</p>
<p>But, as I have already stated, the hour had arrived for calling the
</p>
<p>meeting to order, and as there appeared no one to assume prompt charge,
</p>
<p>the crowd exhibited some manifestations of impatience. About eight
</p>
<p>o'clock there were perhaps 3,000 people in the vicinity of the chosen place,
</p>
<p>and some fifteen or twenty minutes later Spies put in an appearance. He
</p>
<p>mounted the truck wagon improvised as a speaker's stand and inquired for
</p>
<p>Parsons. Receiving no response, he got down, and, meeting Schwab, the
</p>
<p>two entered the alley, where there was quite a crowd, and where they were
</p>
<p>overheard using the words "pis-
</p>
<p>tols" and '-'police," and Schwab
</p>
<p>was heard to ask, " Is one enough
</p>
<p>or had we better go and get
</p>
<p>more?" Both then disappeared
</p>
<p>up the street, and it is a fair
</p>
<p>presumption borne out by the
</p>
<p>fact that they had entered a
</p>
<p>group of Anarchists on the cor-
</p>
<p>ner of Halsted and Randolph
</p>
<p>Streets, as noted in the preced-
</p>
<p>ing chapter, and other circum-
</p>
<p>stances that they went to se-
</p>
<p>cure bombs. Spies shortly re-
</p>
<p>turned, and, meeting Schnaubelt,
</p>
<p>held a short conversation with
</p>
<p>him, at the same time handing
</p>
<p>him something, which Schnau-
</p>
<p>belt put carefully in a side-
</p>
<p>pocket. Spies again mounted
</p>
<p>the wagon (the hour being about INSPECTOR JOHN BONFIELD.
</p>
<p>8:40 Schnaubelt standing near him), and began a speech in English. It
</p>
<p>is needless, at this point, to reproduce the speech, as its substance appears

<p>later on, both as given by the reporters and as written out subsequently
</p>
<p>by Spies. But both reports fail to give a proper conception of its insidi-
</p>
<p>ous effect on the audience. It bore mainly on the grievances of labor,
</p>
<p>the treatment of the strikers by McCormick, and an explanation of his
</p>
<p>(Spies') connection with the disturbances of the day previous. The lesson
</p>
<p>he drew from the occurrence at McCormick's was "that workingmen must
</p>
<p>arm themselves for defense, so that they may be able to cope with the
</p>
<p>Government hirelings of their masters."
</p>
<p>Parsons had meanwhile been sent for, and on the conclusion of Spies'
</p>
<p>harangue was introduced. He reviewed the labor discontent in the coun
</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>try, the troubles growing out of it, touched on monopoly, criticised the so-
</p>
<p>called "capitalistic press," scored the banks, explained Socialism, ex-
</p>
<p>coriated the system of elections, and terminated his remarks by appealing
</p>
<p>to his hearers to defend themselves and asserting that, if the demands of
</p>
<p>the working classes were refused, it meant war. His speech, like that of
</p>
<p>Spies, was mild as compared with what would be expected on such an
</p>
<p>occasion. Perhaps this is accounted for by the fact that during their
</p>
<p>harangues Mayor Harrison mingled in the throng and paid close attention
</p>
<p>to the sentiments of the speakers. He afterwards characterized Parsons'
</p>
<p>effort as "a good political speech," and, being apparently satisfied that
</p>
<p>there would be no trouble, left for the Desplaines Street Police Station,
</p>
<p>giving his impressions of the gathering to the Captain in charge and telling
</p>
<p>Bonfield that there seemed to be no further use for holding the force in
</p>
<p>reserve.
</p>
<p>No sooner had Harrison left for the station and thence for his own
</p>
<p>house, than the next speaker, Fielden, grew bolder in his remarks and sent
</p>
<p>the words rolling hot and fast over an oily, voluble and vindictive tongue.
</p>
<p>He opened with a reference to the insecurity of the working classes under
</p>
<p>the present social system, drifted to the McCormick strike, in which men,
</p>
<p>he said, were " shot down by the law in cold blood, in the city of Chicago,
</p>
<p>in the protection of property," and held that the strikers had " nothing
</p>
<p>more to do with the law except to lay hands on it, and throttle it until it
</p>
<p>makes its last kick. Throttle it ! Kill it ! Stab it ! Can we do any-
</p>
<p>thing," he asked, "except by the strong arm of resistance? The skirmish
</p>
<p>lines have met. The people have
</p>
<p>been shot. Men, women and chil-
</p>
<p>dren have not been spared by the cap-
</p>
<p>italists and the minions of private
</p>
<p>capital. It had no mercy neither
</p>
<p>ought you. You are called upon to
</p>
<p>defend yourselves, your lives, your
</p>
<p>future. I have some resistance in
</p>
<p>me. I know that you have, too."

</p>
<p>At this juncture the police made
</p>
<p>their appearance. During the re-
</p>
<p>marks of Spies and Parsons, detect-
</p>
<p>ives had frequently reported to the
</p>
<p>station that only moderate, temperate
</p>
<p>sentiments were being uttered, but
</p>
<p>after Fielden had got fairly worked
</p>
<p>up to his subject, this was changed.
</p>
<p>The crowd was being wrought up to
</p>
<p>a high point of excitement, and there
</p>
<p>CAPT. WILLIAM WARD.
</p>
<p>FIELDEN' S HARANGUE.
</p>
<p>were frequent interjections of approval and shouts of indignation. Fielden's
</p>
<p>was. just such a speech as they had expected to hear. Very little was
</p>
<p>required to incite them to the perpetration of desperate deeds. Like a
</p>
<p>sculptor with his plastic model, Fielden had molded his audience to suit
</p>
<p>the purpose of the occasion. With his rough and ready eloquence he
</p>
<p>stirred up their innermost pas-
</p>
<p>sions. His biting allusions to
</p>
<p>capitalists caught the hearts of
</p>
<p>the uncouth mob as with grap-
</p>
<p>pling-hooks, and his appeals for
</p>
<p>the destruction of existing laws
</p>
<p>shook them as a whirlwind.
</p>
<p>It would be as well, he said,
</p>
<p>for workmen to die fighting as
</p>
<p>to starve to death. "Exter-
</p>
<p>minate the capitalists, and do it
</p>
<p>to-night ! " The officers detailed
</p>
<p>to watch the proceedings saw
</p>
<p>that the speech portended no
</p>
<p>good, and they communicated
</p>
<p>the facts to Inspector Bonfield.
</p>
<p>Even then the Inspector hesi-
</p>
<p>tated. To use his own language,
</p>
<p>in the report he sent to Super-
</p>
<p>intendent Ebersold : "Wanting
</p>
<p>to be clearly within the law, and
</p>
<p>wishing to leave no room for doubt as to the propriety of our actions, I did
</p>
<p>not act on the first reports, but sent the officers back to make further obser-
</p>
<p>vations. A few minutes after ten o'clock, the officers returned and reported
</p>
<p>that the crowd were getting excited and the speaker growing more incen-
</p>
<p>diary in his language. I then felt that to hesitate any longer would be
</p>
<p>criminal, and gave the order to fall in and move our force forward on Waldo
</p>
<p>Place," a short street south of the Desplaines Street Station.

<p>The force formed into four divisions. The companies of Lieuts. Steele
</p>
<p>and Quinn formed the first ; those of Lieuts. Stanton and Bowler, the sec-
</p>
<p>ond ; those of Lieut. Hubbard and Sergt. Fitzpatrick, the third ; and two
</p>
<p>companies commanded by Lieuts. Beard and Penzen constituted the
</p>
<p>fourth, forming the rear guard, which had orders to form right and left on
</p>
<p>Randolph Street, to guard the rear from any attack from the Haymar-
</p>
<p>ket. These various divisions thus covered the street from curb to curb.
</p>
<p>Inspector Bonfield and Capt. Ward led the forces, in front of the first divis-
</p>
<p>ion. On seeing them advancing in the distance, Fielden exclaimed :
</p>
<p>"Here come the bloodhounds. You do your duty, and I'll do mine ! "

</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>Arriving on the ground, they found the agitator right in the midst of his
</p>
<p>incendiary exhortations, that point where he was telling his Anarchist zeal-
</p>
<p>ots that he had some resistance in him, and assuring them that he knew
</p>
<p>they had too. At that moment the police were ordered to halt within a
</p>
<p>few feet of the truck wagon, and Capt. Ward, advancing to within three feet
</p>
<p>of the speaker, said :
</p>
<p>" I command you, in the name of the people of the State, to immediately
</p>
<p>and peaceably disperse."
</p>
<p>Turning to the crowd, he continued : " I command you and you to
</p>
<p>assist."
</p>
<p>Fielden had meanwhile jumped off the wagon, and, as he reached the
</p>
<p>sidewalk, declared in a clear, loud tone of voice :
</p>
<p>"We are peaceable."
</p>
<p>This must have been the secret signal, it has about it suggestions of
</p>
<p>the word " Ruhe," and no sooner had it been uttered than a spark flashed
</p>
<p>through the air. It looked like the lighted remnant of a cigar, but hissed
</p>
<p>like a miniature skyrocket. It fell in the ranks of the second division and
</p>
<p>near the dividing-line between the companies of Lieuts. Stanton and Bow-
</p>
<p>ler, just south of where the speaking had taken place.
</p>
<p>A terrific explosion followed the detonation was heard for blocks
</p>
<p>around. The direction in which the bomb for such it was had been
</p>
<p>thrown was by way of the east sidewalk from the alley. It had been hurled
</p>
<p>by a person in the shadow of that narrow yet crowded passageway on the
</p>
<p>same side of, and only a few feet from, the speaker's stand.
</p>
<p>The explosion created frightful havoc and terrible dismay. It was
</p>
<p>instantly followed by a volley of small fire-arms from the mob on the side-
</p>
<p>walk and in the street in front of the
</p>
<p>police force, all directed against the offi-
</p>
<p>cers. They were for the moment stunned
</p>
<p>and terror-stricken. In the immediate
</p>
<p>vicinity of the explosion, the entire col-
</p>
<p>.umn under Stanton and Bowler and

</p>
<p>many of the first and third divisions were
</p>
<p>hurled to the ground, some killed, and
</p>
<p>many in the agonies of death.
</p>
<p>As soon as the first flash of the tragic
</p>
<p>shock had passed, and even on the in-
</p>
<p>stant the mob began firing, Inspector
</p>
<p>Bonfield rallied the policemen who re-
</p>
<p>mained unscathed, and ordered a run-
</p>
<p>ning fire of revolvers on the desperate
</p>
<p>Anarchists. Lieuts. Steele and Quinn

<p>curb to curb, and Lieuts. Hubbard and Fitzpatrick, with such men as
</p>
<p>were left them of the Special Detail, swept both sidewalks with a brisk
</p>
<p>and rattling fire.
</p>
<p>The rush of the officers was like that of a mighty torrent in a narrow
</p>
<p>channel they carried everything before
</p>
<p>them and swept down all hapless enough
</p>
<p>to fall under their fire or batons. The
</p>
<p>masterly courage and brilliant dash of
</p>
<p>the men soon sent the Anarchists flying
</p>
<p>in every direction, and a more desperate
</p>
<p>scramble for life and safety was never
</p>
<p>witnessed. Even the most defiant con-
</p>
<p>spirators lost their wits and hunted nooks
</p>
<p>and recesses of buildings to seclude them-
</p>
<p>selves till they could effect an escape
</p>
<p>without imminent danger of bullets or of
</p>
<p>being crushed by the precipitate mob.
</p>
<p>Fielden, so brave and fearless on the
</p>
<p>appearance of the police, pulled a revol-
</p>
<p>ver while crouching beneath the pro-
</p>
<p>tection of the truck wheels, fired at the
</p>
<p>officers, and then took to his heels and disappeared. Spies had friendly
</p>
<p>assistance in getting off the truck, and hastened pell-mell through the
</p>
<p>crowd in a frantic endeavor to get under cover. He finally reached safety,
</p>
<p>while his brother, who was with him on the wagon, got away with a slight
</p>
<p>Avound. Parsons seems to have taken time by the forelock and nervously
</p>
<p>awaited developments in the bar-room of
</p>
<p>Zepf's Hall. Fischer had been among the
</p>
<p>crowd while Spies and Parsons spoke, but
</p>
<p>he was in the company of Parsons at Zepf's

<p>when the explosion occurred. Schnaubelt,

<p>who had sat on the wagon with his hands
</p>
<p>in his pockets until Fielden began his
</p>
<p>speech, hurried through the mob, after
</p>
<p>sending the missile on its deadly mission,
</p>
<p>and got away without a scratch. Other
</p>
<p>lesser yet influential lights in the Anarchist
</p>
<p>combination found friendly refuge, and, as
</p>
<p>subsequently developed, lost no time in
</p>
<p>reaching home as soon as possible. How

<p>not clear, unless they dodged from one secluded spot to another, while the
</p>
<p>storm raged at its height and there are many circumstances showing that
</p>
<p>this was the case. At any rate the point is immaterial : the fact remains
</p>
<p>that they were all found lacking in courage at the critical moment, and
</p>
<p>each seemed more concerned about his own safety than that of his fellow
</p>
<p>revolutionists.
</p>
<p>Owing to the masterly charge of the police, the conflict was of short
</p>
<p>duration, but, while it lasted, it produced a scene of confusion, death and
</p>
<p>bloodshed not equaled in the annals of American riots in its extent and far-
</p>
<p>reaching results. The hissing of bullets, the groans of the dying, the cries
</p>
<p>of the wounded and the imprecations of the fleeing made a combination
</p>
<p>of horrors which those present will never forget.
</p>
<p>No sooner had the field been cleared of the mob than Inspector Bon-
</p>
<p>field set to work caring for the dead and wounded. They were found scat-
</p>
<p>tered in every direction. Many of 'the officers lay prostrate where they
</p>
<p>had fallen, and to the north, where the mob had disputed the ground with
</p>
<p>the police, lay many an Anarchist. On door-steps and in th^e recesses of
</p>
<p>buildings were found wounded and maimed. The police looked after all
</p>
<p>and rendered assistance alike to friend and foe. The dead, dying and
</p>
<p>wounded were conveyed to the Desplaines Street Station, where numerous
</p>
<p>physicians were called into service.
</p>
<p>In subsequently speaking of the bravery of his men on this occasion, in
</p>
<p>his report to the Chief of Police, Inspector Bonfield very truly said :
</p>
<p>It has been asserted that regular troops have become panic-stricken from less cause. I
</p>
<p>see no way to account for it except this. The soldier acts as part of a machine. Rarely, if
</p>
<p>ever, when on duty, is he allowed to act as an individual or to use his personal judgment. A
</p>
<p>police officer's training teaches him to be self-reliant. . Day after day and night after night
</p>
<p>he goes on duty alone, and, when in conflict with the thief and burglar, he has to depend
</p>
<p>upon his own individual exertions. The soldier being a part of a machine, it follows that,
</p>
<p>when a part of it gives out, the rest is useless until the injury is repaired. The policeman,
</p>
<p>being a machine in himself, rarely, if ever, gives up until he is laid on the ground and unable
</p>
<p>to rise again. In conclusion, I beg leave to report that the conduct of the men and officers,
</p>
<p>with few exceptions, was admirable as a- military man said to me the next day, "worthy

</p>
<p>THE scene at the Desplaines Street Station was one which would appal
</p>
<p>the stoutest heart. Every available place in the building was utilized,
</p>
<p>and one could scarcely move about the various rooms without fear of acci-
</p>
<p>dentally touching a wound or jarring a fractured limb. In many instances
</p>
<p>mangled Anarchists were placed side by side with injured officers. The
</p>
<p>floors literally ran with blood dripping and flowing from the lacerated bodies
</p>
<p>of the victims of the riot. The air was filled with moans from the dying
</p>
<p>and groans of anguish from the wounded. As the news had spread through-
</p>
<p>out the city of the terrible slaughter, wives, daughters, relatives and friends
</p>
<p>of officers as well as of Anarchists, who had failed to report at home or to
</p>
<p>send tidings of their whereabouts, hastened to the station and sought
</p>
<p>admission. Being refused, these set up wailing and lamentations about the
</p>
<p>doors of the station, and the doleful sounds made the situation all the more
</p>
<p>sorrowful within.
</p>
<p>Everything in the power of man was done to alleviate the suffering and to
</p>
<p>make the patients as comfortable as possible. Drs. Murphy, Lee and Hen-
</p>
<p>rotin, department physicians, were energetically at work, and, with every
</p>
<p>appliance possible, administered comparative relief and ease from the
</p>
<p>excruciating pains of the suffering. The more seriously wounded, when
</p>
<p>possible, were taken to the Cook County Hospital. Throughout the night
</p>
<p>following the riot, the early morning and the day succeeding, the utmost
</p>
<p>care was given the patients, and throughout the city for days and weeks
</p>
<p>the one inquiry, the one great sympathy, was with reference to the wounded
</p>
<p>officers and their condition. The whole heart of the city was centered in
</p>
<p>their recovery. Everywhere the living 'as well as the dead heroes were
</p>
<p>accorded the highest praise. The culprits who had sought to subvert law
</p>
<p>and order in murder and pillage were execrated on all hands. For days

</p>
<p>and weeks, the city never for a moment relaxed its interest. From the time
</p>
<p>the men had been brought into the station, it was long a question as to how
</p>
<p>many would succumb to their wounds. Care and attention without
</p>
<p>ceasing served to rescue many from an untimely grave ; but even those
</p>
<p>who were finally restored to their families and friends, crippled and maimed
</p>
<p>as they were, hovered between life and death on a very slender thread

<p>through many a restless night and weary day and through long weeks and

</p>
<p>agonizing months. The devotion of friends and the skill of physicians
</p>
<p>nerved the men to strength and patience. That only eight should have
</p>
<p>died out of so great a number as were mangled, lacerated and shattered by
</p>
<p>the powerful bomb and pierced by bullets, attests the merits of the treat-
</p>
<p>ment.
</p>
<p>The only one who was almost instantly killed was Officer Mathias J.
</p>
<p>Degan. The following list will serve to show the names of the officers
</p>
<p>killed and wounded, the stations they belonged to, their residences, the
</p>
<p>nature of their wounds, their condition and other circumstances :
</p>
<p>MATHIAS J. BEGAN Third Precinct, West Lake Street Station ; residence, No. 626
</p>
<p>South Canal Street. Almost instantly killed. He was born October 29, 1851, and joined the
</p>
<p>police force December 15, 1884. He was a widower, having lost his wife just before joining
</p>
<p>the force, and left a young son. He was a brave officer, efficient in all his duties, and highly
</p>
<p>esteemed.
</p>
<p>MICHAEL SHEEHAN Third Precinct; residence, No. 163 Barber Street. Wounded in
</p>
<p>the back just below the ninth rib. The bullet lay in the abdomen, and, after its removal by
</p>
<p>the surgeon, he collapsed and died on the gth of May. He was twenty-nine years of age,
</p>
<p>born in Ireland, and came to America in 1879. He joined the force December 15, 1884, and
</p>
<p>had only one relative in America, a brother, his parents still living in the old country. He
</p>
<p>was a very bright, prompt and efficient officer, and had excellent prospects before him. He
</p>
<p>was unmarried.
</p>
<p>GEORGE MULLER Third Precinct; residence, No. 836 West Madison Street; was shot in
</p>
<p>the left side, the bullet passing down through the body and lodging on the right side above
</p>
<p>the hip bone. He suffered more than any of the others and was in terrible agony. He
</p>
<p>would not consent to an operation, and finally his right lung collapsed, making his breathing
</p>
<p>very difficult. He expired on the 6th of May. He was twenty-eight years of age. Born in
</p>
<p>Oswego, N. Y., where his parents lived, and to which place his remains were sent. Muller,
</p>
<p>on coming to Chicago, began as a teamster, and became connected with the Police Depart-
</p>
<p>ment December 15, 1884, being assigned for duty at the Desplaines Street Station. He was
</p>
<p>a finely built, muscular young man, and became quite a favorite with his associates because
</p>
<p>of his quiet habits and genial manners. At the' time of his death he was engaged to Miss
</p>
<p>Mary McAvoy.
</p>
<p>JOHN J. BARRETT Third Precinct; residence, No. 99 East Erie Street; was shot in the

<p>liver, from which a piece of shell was removed, and he had a bad fracture of the elbow.
</p>
<p>The heel bone of one leg was carried away. With so many serious wounds, he lay in the
</p>
<p>hospital almost unconscious until the day of his death, May 6. He was born in Waukegan,
</p>
<p>111., in 1860, and came to Chicago with his parents when only four years of age. Here he
</p>
<p>attended the public schools, and then learned the molder's trade, which he abandoned on
</p>
<p>January 15, 1885, to join the police force, being assigned to duty at the Desplaines Street
</p>
<p>Station. He was a brave and efficient officer and always ready to do his part in any emer-
</p>
<p>gency. He had been married only a few months preceding his death, and left a wife, a
</p>
<p>widowed mother, three sisters and a younger brother.
</p>
<p>THOMAS REDDEN Third Precinct ; residence, No. 109 Walnut Street ; received a bad
</p>
<p>fracture of the left leg three inches below the knee, from which a large portion of the bone was
</p>
<p>entirely carried away. He also had bullet wounds in the left cheek and right elbow, and
</p>
<p>some wounds in the back. Pieces of shell were found in the leg and elbow. He died May
</p>
<p>16. He was fifty years of age, and had been connected with the police force for twelve
</p>
<p>years, joining it on April i, 1874. He was attached to the West Lake Street Station, and was
</p>
<p>looked upon as an exemplary and trusted officer. He left a wife and two young children.
</p>
<p>A ROLL OF HONOR.
</p>
<p>TIMOTHY FLAVIN Fourth Precinct; residence, No. 504 North Ashland Avenue; was
</p>
<p>struck with a piece of shell four inches above the ankle joint, tearing away a portion of the
</p>
<p>large bone and fracturing the small bone. He also had two wounds just below the shoulder
</p>
<p>joint in the right arm, caused by a shell, and there were two shell wounds in the back, one
</p>
<p>passing into the abdomen and the other into the lung. His leg was amputated above the
</p>
<p>knee, the second day after the explosion, and he had besides a large piece torn out of his
</p>
<p>right hip. He died on May 8. He was born in Listowel, Ireland, and came to America in
</p>
<p>1880 with a young wife, whom he had married on the day of his departure. He had worked
</p>
<p>as a teamster, and joined the police force on December 15, 1884, being assigned to duty at
</p>
<p>the Rawson Street Station. He left a wife and three small children.
</p>
<p>NELS HANSEN Fourth Precinct ; residence, No. 28 Fowler Street ; received shell wounds
</p>
<p>in body, arms and legs, and one of his limbs had to be amputated. He lost considerable

</p>
<p>From a Photograph.
</p>
<p>blood, but lingered along in intense agony until May 14, when he died. He was a native of
</p>
<p>Sweden, having came to Chicago a great number of years ago, joining the force December
</p>
<p>15, 1884, and was about fifty years of age. He left a wife and two children.
</p>
<p>TIMOTHY SULLIVAN, of the Third Precinct, was the last to die from the effects of the
</p>
<p>Haymarket riot ; this brave officer lingered until June 13, 1888. He resided at No. 123
</p>
<p>Hickory Street, and was a widower, four children mourning his loss. The illness from
</p>
<p>which he died was the direct result of a bullet wound just above the left knee.
</p>
<p>The following is a list of the wounded officers belonging to the Third
</p>
<p>Precinct :
</p>
<p>August C. Keller ; residence, No. 36 Greenwich Street ; shell wound in right side and ball

</p>
<p>lodged about the middle of the large bone of the leg, a short distance below the knee A
</p>
<p>piece of shell was removed.
</p>
<p>Lawrence Murphy had fifteen shell wounds, one in the neck, three or four in the arms,
</p>
<p>and one in his left foot ; the last, weighing almost an ounce and a half, lodged at the base of
</p>
<p>the great toe and left his foot hanging by a piece of skin. The foot had to be amputated
</p>
<p>about two inches farther back. He had a piece two inches square taken out of the
</p>
<p>anterior surface of his leg. He had two perforating wounds in the left thigh and a num-
</p>
<p>ber in the right.
</p>
<p>Edward Barrett had two shell wounds in the neighborhood of the knee joint, turning out
</p>
<p>large pieces of flesh and leaving ragged wounds on the surface.
</p>
<p>J. H. King was struck in the chin by a piece of shell which went through his upper lip ;
</p>
<p>another piece carried away about an inch of his lower jaw-bone.
</p>
<p>J. H. Grady had severe flesh wounds, both in the thigh and legs. Some pieces of shell
</p>
<p>were taken out of them.
</p>
<p>John Doyle had several wounds about the legs, in the neighborhood of the knee joint.
</p>
<p>The list shows the character of the wounds and the condition of the
</p>
<p>officers just after the eventful night. Some of those who died lingered along
</p>
<p>for some time after, but the name of Timothy Sullivan was the last to add to
</p>
<p>the death-list. Some of the sixty-eight wounded men have since returned
</p>
<p>to active duty, but many are maimed for life and incapacitated for work.
</p>
<p>It is impossible to say how many of the Anarchists were killed or
</p>
<p>wounded. As soon as they were in a condition to be moved, those in the
</p>
<p>Desplaines Street Station were turned over to their relatives and friends.
</p>
<p>The Anarchists have never attempted to give a correct list, or even an
</p>
<p>approximate estimate, of the men wounded or killed on their side. The
</p>
<p>number, however, was largely in excess of that on the side of the police.
</p>
<p>After the moment's bewilderment, the officers dashed on the enemy and fired
</p>
<p>round after round. Being good marksmen, they fired to kill, and many
</p>
<p>revolutionists must have gone home, either assisted by comrades or unas-
</p>
<p>sisted, with wounds that resulted fatally or maimed them for life. Some of
</p>
<p>those in the station had dangerous wounds, and they were for the most part
</p>
<p>men who had become separated, in the confusion, from their companions, or
</p>
<p>trampled upon so that they could not get up and limp to a safe place. It is

</p>
<p>known that many secret funerals were held from Anarchist localities in the
</p>
<p>dead hour of night. For many months previous to the Haymarket explosion
</p>
<p>the Anarchists had descanted loudly on the destructive potency of dynamite.
</p>
<p>One bomb, they maintained, was equivalent to a regiment of militia. A
</p>
<p>little dynamite, properly put up, could be carried in a vest pocket and used
</p>
<p>to destroy a large body of police. They probably reasoned that if it was
</p>
<p>known that many more of their number had fallen than on the side of the
</p>
<p>police, it would not only tend to diminish the faith of their adherents in the
</p>
<p>real virtues of dynamite, but would prove that the police were more than
</p>
<p>able to cope with the Social Revolution, even though the revolutionists
</p>
<p>depended on that powerful agency. The public is not, therefore, likely ever
</p>
<p>to know how many of their number suffered.

</p>
<p>IT was not difficult to locate the moral responsibility for the bold and bloody
</p>
<p>attack on law and authority. The seditious utterances of such men as
</p>
<p>Spies, Parsons, Fielden, Schwab and other leaders at public gatherings
</p>
<p>for weeks and months preceding the eight-hour strike, and the defiant dec-
</p>
<p>larations of such papers as the Arbeiter-Zeitung and the Alarm, clearly
</p>
<p>pointed to the sources from which came the inspiration for the crowning
</p>
<p>crime of Anarchy. It was likewise a strongly settled conviction that the
</p>
<p>thrower of the bomb was not simply a Guiteau-like crank, but that there
</p>
<p>must have been a deliberate, organized conspiracy, of which he was a duly
</p>
<p>constituted agent. In the work, therefore, of getting at the inside facts,
</p>
<p>the points sought were : What was the exact nature of that conspiracy, and
</p>
<p>who constituted the chief conspirators ? The possession of every detail in
</p>
<p>connection with these two points was absolutely necessary in order to fix
</p>
<p>the criminal responsibility, and to the solution of this problem the officers
</p>
<p>bent all their energies.
</p>
<p>The detectives were well aware that the office of the Arbeiter-Zeitung had
</p>
<p>been the headquarters for the "central, controlling body of the Anarchist
</p>
<p>organizations in Chicago, and on the morning following the explosion

<p>of the leaders as might be found there. Several detectives were assigned
</p>
<p>to this duty, and they soon returned, having under arrest August Spies, his

<p>brother Chris, Michael Schwab and Adolph Fischer, These were locked

</p>
<p>cers repaired to the Arbeiter-Zeitung building and made a most thorough
</p>
<p>search of every room in the premises. A lot of manuscript was found on
</p>
<p>hooks attached to the printers' cases, and this was carefully wrapped up and
</p>
<p>taken away. The files of the Arbeiter-Zeitung and Alarm were also piled

<p>into a wagon and carted to the Central Station.
</p>
<p>Subsequent investigation by Mr. Furthmann of all the scraps of paper

<p>brought over by the police revealed Spies' manuscript with the signal word

<p>This discovery was regar-ded

<p>dissensions and jealousies, and it did not require much frowning or many
</p>
<p>innuendoes from the one to destroy in the other any special interest in

<p>pursuing a clue to its legitimate results. At the start all the officers were

<p>on a keen scent, and while outwardly all seemed working like Trojans in
</p>
<p>order to meet public expectations, which was keyed up to its highest pitch,
</p>
<p>not alone in Chicago but throughout the country, still the fear that one might

<p>get the credit for the work done by another operated to destroy discipline

<p>and deaden personal enthusiasm. Outside events alone prevented a com-

<p>All they knew was that public indignation was strong against them, and

<p>they realized that they were in a very embarrassing situation.
</p>
<p>FISCHER seemed to feel his position at the station more keenly than the
</p>
<p>others. On his arrest he was found to have in his possession a 44-caliber
</p>
<p>revolver, a file sharpened so as to make it serviceable as a dagger, and a
</p>
<p>detonation cap, and, as he was the foreman of the compositors in the office,
</p>
<p>his trepidation may have been caused by a suspicion that possibly the officers

<p>took him to be the leader of an armed gang among them. Before the raid

</p>
<p>way down stairs to find a hiding-place for his weapons at the very moment
</p>
<p>when he was overtaken by the police and relieved of all further trouble.
</p>
<p>The dagger was a peculiar instrument, and it was the general opinion of

</p>
<p>which, through a slight scratch or through a deep plunge of the weapon,
</p>
<p>death would be speedy.
</p>
<p>Fischer always seemed thoroughly unscrupulous as to the means to be
</p>
<p>used to bring about the death of capitalists, and he never tired of uttering
</p>
<p>dire threats against the foes of Socialism. He was a tall, lithe and muscular-
</p>
<p>looking man, and, with a resolute purpose, he impressed his comrades as one
</p>
<p>who would not easily be balked. It is difficult to determine just how Fischer
</p>
<p>came to imbibe his bloodthirsty principles, as little is known of his ante-
</p>
<p>cedents. At the time of his arrest he was twenty-seven years old and married.
</p>
<p>He had been in the United States thirteen or fourteen years. He had
</p>
<p>learned the printer's trade in Nashville, Tenn., working for a brother who
</p>
<p>conducted there a German paper. Subsequently he acquired an interest in
</p>
<p>a German publication at Little Rock, Ark., and in 1881 he moved to St.
</p>
<p>Louis, where he worked at the case and where he became known for his
</p>
<p>extreme ideas on Socialism. He soon found his way to Chicago, where he
</p>
<p>felt satisfied he would find more congenial spirits in the work upon which he
</p>
<p>had set his heart. Here he became associated with Engel and Fehling in
</p>
<p>the publication of a German paper, the Anarchist, but as this did not live long,
</p>
<p>he became a compositor on the Arbeiter-Zeitung. Wherever he was, he
</p>
<p>always talked Anarchy and showed a most implacable hatred of existing
</p>
<p>society.
</p>
<p>When brought to the station, Fischer weakened perceptibly, but after-
</p>
<p>wards braced up and yielded no information except as to his whereabouts
</p>
<p>for several days prior to the Haymarket meeting. He had no love for the
</p>
<p>police, and he did everything in his power to trip us up in our subsequent
</p>
<p>investigations. From the moment of his arrest to the day of his execution
</p>
<p>he adopted a most secretive policy.
</p>
<p>SPIES also weakened at first when brought into the
</p>
<p>station, almost trembling with fear, but, after the first
</p>
<p>flush of excitement had passed, he took on an air of bra-
</p>
<p>vado, and exhibited a bold front in spite of the docu-
</p>
<p>mentary disclosures against him. He became glib of

<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>for critical examination, but every effort to extract definite information
</p>
<p>proved futile.
</p>
<p>Spies was a young man of considerable ability, having enjoyed more
</p>
<p>than a common school education in Germany, and in all his talks he
</p>
<p>demonstrated that he had been a diligent reader of history and an enthu-
</p>
<p>siastic student of Socialism and Anarchy. With all his reading, however, it
</p>
<p>was apparent that he had not carefully digested his information. He
</p>
<p>always acted as if self-conscious of great knowledge. He was a strong
</p>
<p>and effective speaker, but in all
</p>
<p>his harangues there seemed to be
</p>
<p>lacking the element of sincerity.
</p>
<p>For a long time some of his asso-
</p>
<p>ciates doubted if he really meant
</p>
<p>what he said, and there are Anar-
</p>
<p>chists to-day who do not believe
</p>
<p>that he was at any time really in
</p>
<p>earnest in his public utterances.
</p>
<p>They think that he exerted himself
</p>
<p>simply for the purpose of being
</p>
<p>looked upon as a popular leader
</p>
<p>and hero, and that he worked for
</p>
<p>the cause only as a means of ob-
</p>
<p>taining an easy living. He was
</p>
<p>exceedingly vain and pompous,
</p>
<p>and courted public notoriety.
</p>
<p>Spies had received a very good
</p>
<p>salary as editor of the Arbciter-
</p>
<p>Zeitung and enjoyed nothing better
</p>
<p>than to write a fiery editorial or
</p>
<p>deliver an incendiary speech. It

</p>
<p>it pleased his vanity. His constant desire was to place himself on dress
</p>
<p>parade, so to speak, and. he generally sought out, when he lunched down
</p>
<p>town at noon, some fashionable or crowded restaurant. He would strut to
</p>
<p>a table which could only be reached by passing other crowded tables, and
</p>
<p>enjoy the sotto voce remarks as he passed or as he sat at the table he
</p>
<p>had selected "There is Spies, the noted Anarchist." No common An-
</p>
<p>archist, lager-beer-and-pretzel lunch-houses suited him.
</p>
<p>It was at a large restaurant, on the 3d of May, at noon, that he met a
</p>
<p>well-known attorney, to whom he was introduced and with whom he had
</p>
<p>some conversation of a joking, bantering nature. The attorney testified
</p>
<p>before the grand jury subsequently as to this conversation, and the sub-
</p>
<p>A STRANGE INFATUATION. 161
</p>
<p>stance of it will be found in the chapter devoted to a review of its proceed-
</p>
<p>ings. But it transpires that there was some further conversation that does
</p>
<p>not appear in the report of the grand jury investigation, but which has
</p>
<p>since been brought out through the recollection of another party, and,
</p>
<p>which, while it was given in an off-hand way, fully showed that Spies desired
</p>
<p>to make a great impression on the mind of his casual acquaintance as well
</p>
<p>as to intimate the existence of some secret understanding for bringing on
</p>
<p>bloodshed. On that occasion Spies, after being assured that the attorney
</p>
<p>was not an Anarchist, remarked :
</p>
<p>" You had better be one, for in less than twenty-four hours a Socialist, well
</p>
<p>armed, with a market on his shoulder, will appear out of every door, and
</p>
<p>whoever has not got the sign or pass-word will be shot down in his tracks.
</p>
<p>I am about going out now to McCormick's factory, west of here, for the
</p>
<p>purpose of addressing a multitude ot workingmen, and I will raise h 1
</p>
<p>before I get through."
</p>
<p>Besides his fancy for popular restaurants, there was another pecu-
</p>
<p>liarity about Spies. He frequently attended the German theaters, osten-
</p>
<p>sibly for the recreation he might find in the plays, but the principal motive
</p>
<p>was the cultivation of the actresses' acquaintance. Introductions, which he
</p>
<p>sought eagerly, were followed by invitations to wine suppers. He was good
</p>
<p>company, and his lady acquaintances were not averse to accepting his invi-
</p>
<p>tations even though he was an Anarchist. Possibly they doubted the sin-
</p>
<p>cerity of his convictions although they entertained no question about the
</p>
<p>reality of his cash. None of them, however, seem to have visited him during
</p>
<p>his incarceration, save one, a tall woman who now lives on Wells Street
</p>
<p>near Chicago Avenue.
</p>
<p>During his troubles Spies made the acquaintance of a woman in another
</p>
<p>station of life. It was during his trial that Miss Nina Van Zandt became
</p>
<p>interested in him and espoused his cause. She had read of his case, and
</p>
<p>there seemed to be a charm about his conduct as described in the news-
</p>
<p>papers that prompted her to seek his acquaintance. She was a young girl
</p>
<p>of rare beauty and considerable mental endowment, and she had moved in
</p>
<p>the best society, but, notwithstanding her social position and culture, she

</p>
<p>sought an introduction and soon fell desperately in love with the Anarchist.
</p>
<p>She was an only child and the petted daughter of parents of high social con-
</p>
<p>nections, and her immediate relatives were wealthy people in Pittsburg.
</p>
<p>Her parents threw no obstacles in the way of her attachment, and she
</p>
<p>espoused Spies' cause with her whole impetuous nature, and cast her lot
</p>
<p>with the conspirator and his rabble of low-browed followers. It may have
</p>
<p>been love, but it was love which could only have been the product of a
</p>
<p>disordered mind.
</p>
<p>During the later stages of Spies' trial she was a constant visitor at the
</p>
<p>County Jail, frequently accompanied by her mother and sometimes by her

</p>
<p>father, and on each occasion she would bring him some delicacy or token of
</p>
<p>her esteem. Rare flowers and bouquets she either brought or sent daily,
</p>
<p>and the affection she evinced seemed a growth of months instead of days.
</p>
<p>She had great confidence in the jury and implicitly believed that acquittal
</p>
<p>would result at their hands. Her presence invariably graced the court-room,
</p>
<p>whenever possible, and the defendants themselves could not have been more
</p>
<p>eager listeners to the proceedings. When her love for Spies became pub-
</p>
<p>licly known, she attracted great attention, but her demeanor would have led
</p>
<p>one to believe that she was entirely unconscious of the notoriety she had
</p>
<p>achieved. This was not the case.
</p>
<p>It rather pleased her, and, to
</p>
<p>still further intensify public at-
</p>
<p>tention and curiosity, she made
</p>
<p>it a point to display a most varied
</p>
<p>wardrobe during the progress of
</p>
<p>the trial. At the forenoon ses-
</p>
<p>sion she would appear in court
</p>
<p>with one fashionable outfit, and
</p>
<p>this she would change for an
</p>
<p>equally stunning attire in the
</p>
<p>afternoon. She had a striking
</p>
<p>figure, was stately in appear-
</p>
<p>ance, dignified in manner, and
</p>
<p>with a fine, handsome face, it
</p>
<p>was no wonder that she became
</p>
<p>an object of marked attention, in
</p>
<p>the Court-house as well as upon
</p>
<p>the streets.
</p>
<p>But withal she never lost
</p>
<p>sight of her lover nor of the court
</p>
<p>proceedings. Spies was in her mind constantly, and every movement in
</p>
<p>the. trial excited her closest attention. It was indeed a strange infatuation

<p>:she displayed for the Anarchist, and it was the more strange since Spies
</p>
<p>seemed indifferent to her attentions. The public gradually began to learn
</p>
<p>>of this state of affairs through rumors and newspaper reports, but the gen-
</p>
<p>eral opinion was that, if such was the case, Spies had accepted her atten-
</p>
<p>tions simply as a matter either of expediency or from an innate desire
</p>
<p>for notoriety on his part. The public was right. Spies was playing for
</p>
<p>points, as billiardists would say. To be sure, he received her kindly and
</p>
<p>very courteously, and indulged in the expressions which lovers are wont
</p>
<p>to exchange, but those who watched him closely and long could never
</p>
<p>discover that his love came from the heart. He simply saw in her
</p>
<p>devotion and in her standing in society a possible chance for favor-

</p>
<p>ably influencing the minds of the jury, and thus, through her, he hoped
</p>
<p>to secure a release from the troubles surrounding him. When this
</p>
<p>failed and death stared him in the face, he still figured that she could
</p>
<p>prove serviceable to him in influencing her wealthy relatives to aid him
</p>
<p>financially in further conducting his case, or help him in some manner
</p>
<p>in effecting a change in public sentiment. Such were undoubtedly his
</p>
<p>motives at least close observers of his actions hold that theory. When,
</p>
<p>later on, things did not move exactly in the line he had hoped for, he
</p>
<p>willingly assented to a marriage, and entered into the arrangements for its
</p>
<p>celebration with apparent eagerness.
</p>
<p>This course, Spies no doubt supposed, would demonstrate to the unfeeling
</p>
<p>world that there existed a devout mutual attachment, and his claims for
</p>
<p>interested consideration at the hands of her relatives would become greatly
</p>
<p>strengthened. But it only proved his desperate situation. His love had
</p>
<p>been questioned by the public, and mar-
</p>
<p>riage was calculated to settle the doubt.
</p>
<p>The public did not take kindly to the pro-
</p>
<p>posed ceremony. The moment the news-
</p>
<p>papers had announced such a contemplated
</p>
<p>step, the utmost indignation was aroused,
</p>
<p>and protest upon protest poured in upon
</p>
<p>Sheriff Matson. Mr. Matson promptly de-
</p>
<p>clared that no marriage should take place
</p>
<p>between the two while Spies was in his
</p>
<p>custody, and thereafter Miss Van Zandt
</p>
<p>was placed under the strictest surveillance
</p>
<p>whenever she visited her affianced.
</p>
<p>But all this unexpected interference
</p>
<p>in what he regarded as his own business
</p>
<p>only tended to make Spies desperate, and, spurred on by his outside An-
</p>
<p>archist friends, who had likewise become indignant over a public inter-
</p>
<p>meddling in a love affair, he dropped his diplomacy and resolved that the

</p>
<p>wishes of his ardent lady love should not be baffled either by officials or by
</p>
<p>the public. Miss Nina in her unreasoning infatuation readily acquiesced in
</p>
<p>the suggestion of a proxy marriage, and Justice Engelhardt was consulted.
</p>
<p>This gentleman claimed that under the statutes such a marriage would be
</p>
<p>valid, and he consented to a performance of the ceremony. Accordingly,
</p>
<p>on the 2gth of January, 1887, a proxy marriage was performed between
</p>
<p>Miss Nina and Chris Spies, a brother of the doomed man. The attorneys
</p>
<p>of Chicago regarded the ceremony as illegal, but the Anarchists considered
</p>
<p>it as binding as if directly contracted.
</p>
<p>Miss Nina continued her visits to the jail after this mock proceeding,
</p>
<p>but lynx-eyed officials saw to it that there was no one present during her

<p>interviews with Spies to secretly and legally splice them together. She was
</p>
<p>devoted to him at all times and all the time, and whenever she was not well
</p>
<p>enough to visit him for some days or was kept away by other circumstances,
</p>
<p>she would write him tender missives of love and encouragement. She clung
</p>
<p>to him to the last, and in their final interview, two days preceding
</p>
<p>his execution, she wept most bitterly.
</p>
<p>Her love was remarkable, but throughout it all Spies proved himself
</p>
<p>wholly unworthy. He was a reprobate cunningly playing upon her feelings,
</p>
<p>caring very little for her, and he must have known that her station in life at
</p>
<p>that time made her an unsuitable
</p>
<p>companion. For him, however,
</p>
<p>she renounced friends and all.
</p>
<p>After his death she went into deep
</p>
<p>mourning, hung a cabinet photo-
</p>
<p>graph of him in the parlor window
</p>
<p>of her father's fashionable resi-
</p>
<p>dence on Huron Street, and locked
</p>
<p>herself in against the outer world
</p>
<p>for a number of days. She still
</p>
<p>cherishes Spies' memory and keeps
</p>
<p>in her parlor a marble bust of the
</p>
<p>executed Anarchist. Recently she
</p>
<p>has been extending her acquaint-
</p>
<p>anceship among Anarchists out-

<p>arrived in Chicago, where he engaged in various occupations until he

<p>was far less talented and less active than the other leaders, but still in his

<p>He had seen something of the world as a peripatetic book-binder. Through

</p>
<p>seemed the only thing suited to right the wrongs of mankind. He fell in
</p>
<p>with the ideas of the cranks in Chicago, and soon wormed himself into an
</p>
<p>assistant editorial position of $18 a week on the Ar better- Zeitung. In
</p>
<p>appearance Schwab was ungainly and ferocious, but when put to the test he
</p>
<p>was calm and mild as a lamb. The only thing really vicious about him was in
</p>
<p>his incendiary writings and
</p>
<p>speeches. He aimed with his
</p>
<p>limited capacity to be a great
</p>
<p>leader, but the moment he got
</p>
<p>into the clutches of the law and
</p>
<p>found himself in peril of his life
</p>
<p>he retracted everything which
</p>
<p>he had so persistently and stub-
</p>
<p>bornly advocated. His new trou-
</p>
<p>bles brought out the fact that
</p>
<p>he had written and spoken simply
</p>
<p>for the money that was in the
</p>
<p>business, and not because he sin-
</p>
<p>cerely believed in the theories he
</p>
<p>preached. He was at all times
</p>
<p>a supple tool in the hands of
</p>
<p>Spies and Parsons, and during
</p>
<p>the remainder of his days in
</p>
<p>the penitentiary he will have
</p>
<p>ample opportunities to repent of
</p>
<p>his past misdeeds.

<p>reaching Chicago in the year following. He afterwards traveled from point

<p>to point in the West, roughed it a little, and three or four years later

<p>drifted back to Chicago. He is a brother of the notorious Anarchist of New

<p>ALBERT R. PARSONS was another leader wanted by the police, and the

<p>search for him was immediately instituted. Officers went to his house
</p>
<p>only to discover that he had escaped, and for some time it was believed that
</p>
<p>he was in hiding among his friends in the city. Every effort, however, to
</p>
<p>find him failed, and there were all sorts of speculations as to his where-

<p>abouts. It was found out afterwards that he had become alarmed ovet
</p>
<p>the aspect of affairs resulting from the Haymarket meeting, and, thinking
</p>
<p>"discretion the better part of valor," he had gathered a few dollars together,
</p>
<p>boarded an outgoing train, and landed at Geneva, 111., thoroughly dis-
</p>
<p>guised. He sought out the home of a friend named Holmes, who cherished
</p>
<p>Anarchist sentiments, and remained with him three or four days in conceal-
</p>
<p>ment. With a dilapidated outfit, he concluded to shift his abiding-place,
</p>
<p>and accordingly he went to Elgin, 111., where he was taken care of. From
</p>
<p>this point, in the course of a few days, he went to Waukesha, Wis., and
</p>
<p>there hunted around for work as a tramp carpenter. Waukesha is a great
</p>
<p>resort for Chicago people, but no
</p>
<p>one recognized him in his changed
</p>
<p>appearance. He succeeded in find-
</p>
<p>ing employment, and for some
</p>
<p>time worked as a carpenter, un-
</p>
<p>known and undetected. The labor
</p>
<p>proving too arduous for his unde-
</p>
<p>veloped muscles and contrary to
</p>
<p>his principles as an Anarchist, he
</p>
<p>began to look out for easier work,
</p>
<p>and this he managed to secure as
</p>
<p>a painter. For seven weeks he
</p>
<p>remained at Waukesha, commu-
</p>
<p>nicating with his wife under an
</p>
<p>assumed name and through a third
</p>
<p>party living out of Chicago.
</p>
<p>When the trial opened, the

</p>
<p>confident that the State had not
</p>
<p>sufficient evidence to convict, and
</p>
<p>upon assurances from Capt. Black
</p>
<p>that an acquittal was certain, Parsons decided to surrender himself to

</p>
<p>the authorities. He boarded a train, reached the city, and, securing a
</p>
<p>hack, drove to his home, on Milwaukee Avenue, where he met his wife.
</p>
<p>After remaining there for three or four hours, he got into a hack, in
</p>
<p>company with Mrs. Parsons, and drove down to the Criminal Court build-
</p>
<p>ing. It was on the 2ist of June, after Judge Gary had overruled a
</p>
<p>motion for separate trials, that Parsons reached the building. He alighted,
</p>
<p>tripped up the stairs, and entered the court-room. If a bomb had exploded
</p>
<p>on the outside, it would scarcely have created a greater surprise than the
</p>
<p>appearance of Parsons as he stalked in and took his seat with the prisoners.
</p>
<p>Parsons was born in Montgomery, Ala., June 20, 1848, and after he had
</p>
<p>reached the age of five, his brother, Gen. W. H. Parsons, of the Confeder-

<p>ate army, took his education in charge at the latter's home in Tyler, Texas.
</p>
<p>When young Parsons was eleven years of age, he learned the printer's
</p>
<p>trade, and finally drifted into the service of the Confederate army. After
</p>
<p>the "unpleasantness," he branched out as editor of a paper at Waco, Texas,
</p>
<p>and then connected himself with the Houston Telegraph. He identified
</p>
<p>himself about this time with the Republican party, and, taking an active
</p>
<p>part in politics, he became Secretary of the State Senate under the Federal
</p>
<p>Government. In 1872 he married a mulatto at Houston, and, being dis-
</p>
<p>carded by his brother and
</p>
<p>friends, he emigrated with
</p>
<p>her to Chicago in 1873. No
</p>
<p>sooner had he reached Chi-
</p>
<p>cago than he joined the So-
</p>
<p>cialists. He worked for a
</p>
<p>time as a newspaper com-
</p>
<p>positor, but his radical ideas
</p>
<p>and obtrusive arguments pre-
</p>
<p>vented him from holding any
</p>
<p>position permanently. He
</p>
<p>eventually became editor of
</p>
<p>the Alarm and depended on
</p>
<p>his Anarchist friends for a
</p>
<p>livelihood. He was always
</p>
<p>active at their meetings, both
</p>
<p>secret and public, and paraded
</p>
<p>himself as a labor agitator.
</p>
<p>He managed to become a
</p>
<p>member of the Knights of
</p>
<p>Labor, but that body as a
</p>
<p>whole, after seeing how ex-
</p>
<p>tremely radical were his theo-
</p>
<p>ries, repudiated him.

<p>When his troubles over-
</p>
<p>took him in connection with the trial, Parsons' brother came to his
</p>
<p>defense and took a keen interest in his case, working for him until
</p>
<p>the very last. Mrs. Parsons had early identified herself with her husband's
</p>
<p>views, and was one among several others to organize a women's branch
</p>
<p>of the Anarchists. She can make an effective address, and she always
</p>
<p>took a leading part in extending the membership of her union. On the
</p>
<p>question of her birth, she maintains that she is of Mexican extraction,
</p>
<p>with no negro blood in her veins, but her swarthy complexion and distinct-
</p>
<p>ively negro features do not bear out her assertions. Since her husband's
</p>
<p>execution she has appeared on the stump in various parts of the United
</p>
<p>States, and she is now even more violent than ever.

<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>OSCAR W. NKEBE was fortunate in the failure of the prosecution to
</p>
<p>show his direct complicity in the Haymarket murder. There was no doubt
</p>
<p>as to his active participation in all the plots of the Anarchist leaders, and,
</p>
<p>had it not been for the loss of some important papers, he would now be
</p>
<p>serving a life sentence instead of a fifteen years' term in the penitentiary.
</p>
<p>He took an active part in stirring up the members of the Brewers' Union
</p>
<p>after the McCormick riot, and he contributed no little towards sending
</p>
<p>many of those members to the Haymarket meeting, ready for violence and
</p>
<p>desperate deeds. Immediately following the Haymarket slaughter, he was
</p>
<p>placed under arrest and taken to the
</p>
<p>Central Station at the City Hall. He
</p>
<p>was there questioned in a general way,
</p>
<p>but the near-sighted officials then in
</p>
<p>charge of that important department
</p>
<p>were unable to see any reason for his
</p>
<p>detention and permitted him to depart
</p>
<p>with his friend Schnaubelt, who had
</p>
<p>been gathered in about the same time.
</p>
<p>This led him to believe that he had
</p>
<p>friends at the Central Headquarters.
</p>
<p>His belief in his "influence" was some-
</p>
<p>what shaken, however, when I ordered
</p>
<p>a search of his house on the 8th of
</p>
<p>May. The officers on that occasion
</p>
<p>found one Springfield rifle, one Colt's
</p>
<p>38-caliber revolver, one sword and belt
</p>
<p>of the Lehr und Wehr Verein, a red
</p>
<p>flag, a transparency, a lot of circulars
</p>
<p>calling different meetings, including
</p>
<p>the one calling for "revenge," and
</p>
<p>several cards of Anarchist groups, and
</p>
<p>with all these and other evidence of his connection with the great con-

<p>spiracy, I went before the grand jury and had him indicted for conspiracy
</p>
<p>to murder. On the 2yth of May, about 6 o'clock, Deputy Sheriff
</p>
<p>Alexander Reed called at the Chicago Avenue Station and asked me for
</p>
<p>assistance to arrest Neebe under the indictment. I detailed Officer Whalen
</p>
<p>for this duty, and the two called at the man's house, No. 307 Sedgwick
</p>
<p>Street. The deputy sheriff informed Neebe that he was under arrest, and
</p>
<p>the officer explained the nature of the charge against him. They told him
</p>
<p>that they would be obliged to take him to the County Jail.
</p>
<p>Neebe smiled when notified of the charge, and remarked in a most care-
</p>
<p>less manner :
</p>
<p>" Is that all? That's nothing. I will get out on bail right away. 1 '

</p>
<p>But he did not ; he had to linger for a long time.
</p>
<p>Neebe was born in the State of New York, in 1850, of German parents,
</p>
<p>and since his location in Chicago he had succeeded in establishing a pros-
</p>
<p>perous business in the sale of yeast to grocers and traders. He was ambi-
</p>
<p>tious to distinguish himself in other directions, however, and he chose
</p>
<p>Anarchy as a basis for building up a reputation as a leader among men.
</p>
<p>He achieved considerable notoriety, as he was active, energetic and push-
</p>
<p>ing, and at the time of the Board of Trade demonstration he acted as chief
</p>
<p>marshal of the procession.
</p>
<p>Neebe was in the habit of. taking members of the North Side group to
</p>
<p>Sheffield, Ind., for the purpose of practicing and experimenting with
</p>
<p>dynamite bombs. It was on one of these experimenting excursions that he
</p>
<p>lost the joints of all the fingers of his right hand by a premature explosion.
</p>
<p>When questioned about it, he told all his friends and even his own family
</p>
<p>that he had lost his fingers in assisting a friend to lift a sharp building-stone
</p>
<p>on the South Side. His family physician was asked with reference to the
</p>
<p>matter, and, after some hesitation, finally stated that Neebe had admitted
</p>
<p>that he had lost his fingers through the explosion of a bomb. In the expla-
</p>
<p>nation Neebe gave to his friends he overlooked the fact that if a sharp
</p>
<p>building-stone had taken off his fingers it would not have taken his thumb,
</p>
<p>because that member of the hand is never in a position to be crushed when
</p>
<p>one lifts a heavy stone.
</p>
<p>After his trial and conviction, Neebe's wife and little children often visited
</p>
<p>him at the jail, and Mrs. Neebe sought as well as she could to raise his
</p>
<p>drooping spirits. But she subsequently took sick, and after a short illness
</p>
<p>died. A most demonstrative funeral was arranged by the Anarchists. The
</p>
<p>hall in which the ceremonies were conducted was profusely decorated with
</p>
<p>flowers and emblems of mourning. Under most binding pledges on the part
</p>
<p>of the Anarchists, Sheriff Matson permitted Neebe, under proper official
</p>
<p>escort, to take a last look at the remains of his wife at the residence, and
</p>
<p>the scene was a most impressive one. Mrs. Neebe had been a firm believer
</p>
<p>in the doctrines advocated by her husband, but his friends claimed that the
</p>
<p>unexpected troubles of the family had precipitated sickness and brought on

</p>
<p>death. At one time it was thought that some serious disturbance might grow
</p>
<p>out of the demonstration, and that, with Neebe back at his home, an attempt
</p>
<p>at his rescue from the hands of the county officials might be made. But the
</p>
<p>police were present to see that order was maintained. The only thing bor-
</p>
<p>dering on disorder was the fiery speeches of the orators at the hall to which
</p>
<p>the remains were first taken, and from which an immense procession started
</p>
<p>to the place of burial.
</p>
<p>The death of his wife was a severe blow to Neebe. Verily, the way of
</p>
<p>the transgressor is hard. He was subsequently removed to the penitentiary,
</p>
<p>and possibly by the time his sentence expires he may be able to see life in a
</p>
<p>different light than through Anarchist spectacles.

</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>RUDOLPH SCHNAUBELT is indeed a fortunate man, and, wherever he is at
</p>
<p>present, he must be felicitating himself on his escape from a felon's death.
</p>
<p>On the morning of May 5, after all the help in the Arbeiter-Zeitung had been
</p>
<p>arrested, Schnaubelt was gathered in and taken to the Central Station. He
</p>
<p>was suspected of complicity in the conspiracy, but there seemed to be so
</p>
<p>"little against the young man," that he was promptly released without the
</p>
<p>slightest pains being taken to inquire into his antecedents. Under the free
</p>
<p>and easy system then
</p>
<p>prevailing in the depart-
</p>
<p>ment, there seemed to
</p>
<p>be no idea that officers
</p>
<p>were employed for other
</p>
<p>purposes than simply
</p>
<p>drawing salaries. I look-
</p>
<p>ed carefully into the re-
</p>
<p>lease of Schnaubelt, and
</p>
<p>the more I saw of it, the
</p>
<p>more I was convinced
</p>
<p>that the examination of
</p>
<p>this most important pris-
</p>
<p>oner was the same kind
</p>
<p>of investigation as those
</p>
<p>one could have seen at
</p>
<p>some of the primaries
</p>
<p>three or four years ago,
</p>
<p>when, if a man happen-
</p>
<p>ed to be of a certain po-
</p>
<p>j-psi
</p>
<p>litical faith, he would be
</p>
<p>passed along with the
</p>
<p>remark, " He's all right,"
</p>
<p>and permitted to vote.

</p>
<p>tions and then allowed to go. The stupid detectives knew he was a close
</p>
<p>friend of Spies and Fielden, who were already locked up, and to prove that
</p>
<p>friendship now that they were in trouble, Schnaubelt frequently dropped
</p>
<p>in at the City Hall to inquire after them. He continued to hang around
</p>
<p>under the tolerance of the officials, and I have always believed that the
</p>
<p>only thing that saved him from being locked up was the fortunate circum-
</p>
<p>stance that no one put a sign on his back reading that he was the bomb-
</p>
<p>thrower.
</p>
<p>Officers Palmer and Cosgrove had managed to get a slight clue against
</p>
<p>this man, and they arrested him again on the 6th of May. They stated their
</p>
<p>SCHNA UBEL T'S L UCK. 1 7 1
</p>
<p>case to Lieut. John D. Shea, and by him the arrest was reported to his superior
</p>
<p>officer. What was the result ? Shea did not care to be bothered with the
</p>
<p>case. The head of the department likewise did not care to be troubled.
</p>
<p>They accordingly saved themselves all further annoyance by telling Schnau-
</p>
<p>belt to go away. The prisoner, with singular stolidity, did not seem to care
</p>
<p>particularly, and had to be told again that he was at liberty to go where he
</p>
<p>pleased. It is a wonder that the officials did not offer him a cigar in
</p>
<p>acknowledgment of their kindly feelings. When Schnaubelt was released,
</p>
<p>Officer Palmer remonstrated with the Lieutenant, but he was told to let the
</p>
<p>man alone and not bring him there any more. That ended the matter with
</p>
<p>the officer. Several other detectives had meanwhile learned of Schnaubelt's
</p>
<p>close friendship with Spies and other Anarchists, but when they learned of
</p>
<p>the instructions Officers Palmer and Cosgrove had received they likewise
</p>
<p>dropped all investigations when they reached Schnaubelt. The man natur-
</p>
<p>ally felt pleased at such friendly favor and remained in the city until about
</p>
<p>the 1 3th of May.
</p>
<p>It was on the I4th of May that I first received information about the
</p>
<p>part Schnaubelt had played in all the Anarchist meetings and that I learned
</p>
<p>something of his special intimacy with Fischer and Balthasar Rau.
</p>
<p>"You get him," said my informant, "and I will tell you something inter-
</p>
<p>esting that will surprise everybody."
</p>
<p>At this time the man was called Schnabel, and the information was that
</p>
<p>he was working in a store on the South Side. I at once sent Officers Whalen
</p>
<p>and Stift to hunt him up. While engaged in the search they met Officers
</p>
<p>Palmer and Cosgrove. Whalen explained their mission, and then Palmer
</p>
<p>asked :
</p>
<p>" Are you not afraid to arrest him ?"
</p>
<p>Whalen wanted to know why there should be any fear in the case,
</p>
<p>and Palmer remarked :
</p>
<p>"Well, you are running a chance of getting yourselves in trouble. We
</p>
<p>wanted to arrest Schnaubelt in the Arbeiter-Zeitung office, and we were not
</p>
<p>allowed to do so. We found him, Neebe, Fischer, Mrs. Parsons, Mrs.
</p>
<p>Schwab and Mrs. Holmes in the editor's room. Shea told us not to arrest

</p>
<p>him, that he was a ' big stiff,' and then and there he told Schnaubelt to get
</p>
<p>away from there or he would kick him out. All the others were arrested,
</p>
<p>but he was let go. I was detailed to remain around the building. Schnau-
</p>
<p>belt came around there again afterwards, and I arrested him and took him to
</p>
<p>the Central Station. There the man was told to go and get out. On the
</p>
<p>next day he came around there again. I had in the meantime obtained a
</p>
<p>little information about him, and I arrested him and took him to the Central
</p>
<p>Station. I was again asked if I had not been told to let him alone and was
</p>
<p>curtly informed that I was altogether too officious. Schnaubelt was again
</p>
<p>released. I explained that he was a partner of Fischer, that he had the big
</p>
<p>revolver and dagger ; but it was no use he was permitted to leave."
</p>
<p>1 7 2 ANAR CHY AND ANAR CHISTS.
</p>
<p>Officer Whalen replied : " We work for a different man, and I would
</p>
<p>like to see Schnaubelt if he is in the city."
</p>
<p>Officer Gosgrove remarked that he knew where the man was working,
</p>
<p>and the two officers proffered their services to pilot Whalen and Stift to the
</p>
<p>place. They went to No. 224 Washington Street, third floor, but on reach-
</p>
<p>ing there they learned that "the bird had flown." He had not even drawn
</p>
<p>the wages due him, having sent his sister after the money. It subsequently
</p>
<p>transpired that Schnaubelt was the very man who had thrown the bomb at
</p>
<p>the Haymarket, but he had " taken time by the forelock " and skipped for
</p>
<p>parts unknown. Possibly he had got tired of being kicked out of the office
</p>
<p>of the Chief of Police and left Chicago in disgust, or possibly his friends at
</p>
<p>the Central Station may have given him a "tip " to save himself from serious
</p>
<p>trouble.
</p>
<p>Some two weeks thereafter I received information as to where Schnau-
</p>
<p>belt could be found.
</p>
<p>I told Mr. Grinnell what I had learned, and he asked me to send a few men
</p>
<p>at once and get him. I informed Mr. Grinnell that I could not detail officers
</p>
<p>outside of the city limits without the consent of the Chief. Mr. Grinnell
</p>
<p>thought I had better do so anyway. I insisted that I must see the Chief
</p>
<p>first, and Mr. Grinnell remarked :
</p>
<p>" If you do, that will be the end of that matter."
</p>
<p>I went, however, to the Chief's office, and stated my business. I was
</p>
<p>there told that they would get the man. The Chief said that he would go
</p>
<p>out to California and thus head him off. I reported back to Mr. Grinnell the

<p>result of my interview, and he remarked :
</p>
<p>"Well, that is just what I expected jealousy, and that is all."
</p>
<p>Schnaubelt thus had a good friend at the City Hall, and he cannot thank
</p>
<p>the officers there too much for having saved him the painful necessity of
</p>
<p>going down to death on the nth of November, 1887, with the other con-

</p>
<p>BALTHASAR RAU was another man who did not tarry in Chicago. He had
</p>
<p>been a faithful lieutenant of Spies and had earned a living as solicitor for
</p>
<p>the Arbeiter-Zeitung. He took a keen interest in all of Spies' plans, and on

<p>Saturday afternoon preceding the day of the riot visited the vicinity of
</p>
<p>McCormick's factory to secure points about the strike for his friend's infor-
</p>
<p>mation. He reported that ten thousand striking lumber-shovers had met
</p>
<p>on that day and had appointed a committee to wait upon the lumber bosses
</p>
<p>to induce them to inaugurate the eight-hour system in the various yards.
</p>
<p>Rau had seen the gathering, and, as the committee appointed by it were to
</p>
<p>report to another meeting the following Monday, he knew that it would
</p>
<p>bring together just such a throng, if not a larger one than the previous
</p>
<p>assemblage. He so posted Spies, and in turn was advised by his friend to
</p>
<p>insert in the Fackel of Sunday, May 2, the notice " Y, come Monday night,"
</p>
<p>BALTHASAR RAU.
</p>
<p>173
</p>
<p>which was the signal for the armed groups to meet that night at No. 54
</p>
<p>West Lake Street. The bandits did meet, and matured the conspiracy
</p>
<p>which was carried out the following night at the Haymarket. On Monday
</p>
<p>Rau went with Spies to McCormick's factory, aided in inciting the people to
</p>
<p>a riot, and then accompanied his friend to the strikers' headquarters on Lake
</p>
<p>Street, where they informed the people that ten or twelve of their brother
</p>
<p>workmen had been brutally shot down by the "bloodhounds" the police
</p>
<p>that afternoon.
</p>
<p>In consequence of his intimacy with Spies, Rau was at once and the
</p>
<p>only one at first suspected of
</p>
<p>being the thrower of the fatal bomb.
</p>
<p>He seemed to realize that he was
</p>
<p>under suspicion, for he speedily
</p>
<p>left the city after the explosion.
</p>
<p>Assistant State's Attorney Furth-
</p>
<p>mann learned that he had fled to
</p>
<p>Omaha and promptly repaired to
</p>
<p>that city. By instructions, James
</p>
<p>Bonfield was to secure the neces-
</p>
<p>sary requisition papers for Rau's
</p>
<p>extradition from the State of Ne-
</p>
<p>braska and was to follow Furth-
</p>
<p>mann to Omaha. The Assistant
</p>
<p>State's Attorney found Rau willing
</p>
<p>to talk, and asked him to write as
</p>
<p>he had been dictated, to the text
</p>
<p>of the signal, "Y, come Monday
</p>
<p>night." Rau promptly discovered
</p>
<p>that Furthmann knew some of the
</p>
<p>inside facts in the conspiracy, and
</p>
<p>tremblingly asked what he could
</p>
<p>do to save his neck from the rope.

</p>
<p>He was informed that nothing short of "unconditional surrender" would
</p>
<p>help him out of his scrape, and that he must not keep back any informa-
</p>
<p>tion. He then unbosomed himself and told everything he knew.
</p>
<p>While these things were taking place the leaders of the Anarchist group
</p>
<p>in Omaha were collecting money to take Rau away from Mr. Furthmann by
</p>
<p>habeas corpus proceedings. Rau had meanwhile been locked up in a cell
</p>
<p>where he could not easily be reached by his friends, and, as he did not like
</p>
<p>his surroundings, he was anxious to return to Chicago even without extra-
</p>
<p>dition papers. It was on a Monday before daylight that he agreed to go,
</p>
<p>and Mr. Furthmann promptly took him across the river to Council Bluffs,
</p>
<p>in the State of Iowa, to avoid litigation, as he had learned that the Omaha

<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>judge was ready and willing to assist the Anarchists of that section in effect-
</p>
<p>ing Rau's release. At this time the extradition papers had not arrived. On
</p>
<p>taking up the trip to Chicago Rau became more communicative than ever
</p>
<p>and entered into details quite interestingly.
</p>
<p>Some one in the parlor car which conveyed them to Chicago recognized
</p>
<p>Mr. Furthmann, and it was whispered around :
</p>
<p>"There's Furthmann with the bomb-thrower!"
</p>
<p>A flutter of excitement speedily developed, and soon a demand was made
</p>
<p>on Furthmann that unless he handcuffed Rau the passengers would object
</p>
<p>to his sitting in the parlor car, and they certainly would not allow Rau to
</p>
<p>sleep in the same car unless shackles were placed about his limbs. A
</p>
<p>great deal of parleying ensued. Finally Mr. Furthmann consented to
</p>
<p>appease the now thoroughly frightened passengers. Only one condition
</p>
<p>was imposed by Mr. Furthmann, and that was that the handcuffs and
</p>
<p>shackles should be furnished, as he had none in his possession. The
</p>
<p>implements were immediately telegraphed for, and were on hand when
</p>
<p>Cedar Rapids was reached. But the idea of handcuffing and shackling a
</p>
<p>man who was willingly returning without extradition papers was repulsive
</p>
<p>to Mr. Furthmann.
</p>
<p>A novel thought flashed through the Assistant State's Attorney's mind.
</p>
<p>He informed Rau of everything that had transpired, and told him that he
</p>
<p>did not desire to shackle him in any way. But for the purpose of quieting
</p>
<p>the passengers he would rattle the iron bracelets around in good shape if
</p>
<p>Rau would give up his coat, vest, pantaloons, shirt, drawers, stockings and
</p>
<p>shoes and hat during the night. This was done, and the passengers, hear-
</p>
<p>ing the rattling of the chains at intervals during the night, rested in the
</p>
<p>sweet confidence that a violent outburst on the part of a wild Anarchist had
</p>
<p>been averted.
</p>
<p>The prisoner was safely landed in Chicago, and not a handcuff or
</p>
<p>shackle had been placed about him. He was taken to the Chicago Avenue
</p>
<p>Station, and there put through an examination by State's Attorney Grin-
</p>
<p>nell.

</p>
<p>In the statement he made to Mr. Grinnell and myself Rau gave his age
</p>
<p>as thirty, his occupation as that of a printer, and his residence as No. 418
</p>
<p>Larrabee Street.
</p>
<p>"We had," he said, "an excursion to Sheffield, Indiana, and there were
</p>
<p>present August Spies, Schwab, Neebe, Engel and Schnaubelt. Those are
</p>
<p>the only ones I can now remember. Engel and Schnaubelt were the ones
</p>
<p>to set dynamite bombs for experiments."
</p>
<p>"Why do you good people use dynamite bombs, and what do you intend
</p>
<p>to do with them?" asked Mr. Grinnell.
</p>
<p>Rau hesitated, but finally replied : "The time we shot off the dynamite
</p>
<p>bombs at Sheffield, at the time of the explosion there were only a few of us
</p>
<p>MR. RAWS DEPOSITION. 175
</p>
<p>present. They were the parties whose names I have given and a man who
</p>
<p>came with Engel. We exploded only two bombs, and they were made of
</p>
<p>iron and were round."
</p>
<p>"What is the meaning and for what purpose does that letter 'Y' appear
</p>
<p>in the Arbeiter-Zeitung ?" asked Mr. Furthmann.
</p>
<p>" The last time I saw it was on Sunday, May 2, 1886. The Sunday issue
</p>
<p>of the Arbeiter-Zeitung is called the Packet. Lorenz Hermann was requested
</p>
<p>to have the letter ' Y ' inserted in the paper, and it was printed in the issue
</p>
<p>mentioned. He brought the notice to the office. We did not charge any-
</p>
<p>thing for notices brought in by the members of the armed section. And
</p>
<p>that letter ' Y ' was intended to signify that there would be a meeting at No.
</p>
<p>54 West Lake Street, May 3, for the armed men. I was at Zepf's Hall at
</p>
<p>a meeting held Monday, May 3. I had with me a lot of 'Revenge' cir-
</p>
<p>culars, calling people to arms. I gave the circulars to the boys who were
</p>
<p>present at the meeting. It was after nine o'clock. One meeting had been
</p>
<p>called by the carpenters for that night. August Belz is the man who told
</p>
<p>me the meaning of the word. He asked me at Greif's Hall if I knew the
</p>
<p>meaning of the word 'Ruhe, ' and if I knew what effect its publication
</p>
<p>would have. He then told me that they had agreed that the word ' Ruhe '
</p>
<p>should apply to a meeting at the Haymarket. If it appeared in the Arbeiter-
</p>
<p>Zeitung, he said, then there would be trouble. The trouble would be fight-
</p>
<p>ing the police, storming buildings and throwing dynamite bombs. When I
</p>
<p>saw that word in the Arbeiter-Zeitung, I was working in the office of that
</p>
<p>paper. I remarked to August Spies that that would make trouble in the
</p>
<p>city, and his answer was that Fischer did it, meaning that Fischer was
</p>
<p>responsible for it. Spies, after I had told him what trouble it would make,
</p>
<p>got excited and called Schnaubelt. Spies asked him, ' How is this ? ' refer-
</p>
<p>ring to the word ' Ruhe. ' Schnaubelt replied, ' Well, they want to throw
</p>
<p>dynamite bombs.' He also said that if the police interfered, then there
</p>
<p>would be trouble at the Haymarket. He further said that the people
</p>
<p>stationed on the outskirts of the city, east, west, south and north, should be
</p>
<p>informed as to when the riot commenced and when their time had arrived
</p>
<p>for storming the city. When Fischer was asked about this word ' Ruhe '

</p>
<p>he was close-mouthed. He would not say anything to us. I heard Spies
</p>
<p>say in his office, ' If that word " Ruhe "is in the paper, there will be trouble,
</p>
<p>and I don't want that. That will break up our organization.' Spies said :
</p>
<p>'I will print hand-bills to stop the meeting at the Haymarket May 4.' He
</p>
<p>said he would attend to that himself. I said that we had better put up signs
</p>
<p>on the corners to notify the people that there would be no meeting at the
</p>
<p>Haymarket that night. Spies said that if there was a meeting, then there
</p>
<p>would be trouble. Schnaubelt was to go to the North Side that afternoon,
</p>
<p>May 4, and tell the people that there would be no meeting at the Haymarket
</p>
<p>that night. On May 4, in the evening, some one called at the office and

</p>
<p>wanted Spies to speak at the meeting at Deering Station ; but he could not
</p>
<p>be found, and consequently we sent Schwab. Afterwards I went over to
</p>
<p>the West Side meeting at the Haymarket. I saw Spies standing on a wagon,
</p>
<p>making a speech to the people present. When he saw me he called me and
</p>
<p>asked me to go and find Parsons. Spies said, ' 1 want help here, and he
</p>
<p>must help me out.' I went to look for Parsons, and I found him. Parsons
</p>
<p>and Fielden were together. I told them what Spies had said and I asked
</p>
<p>them to go and help him. They did go I went along. W r e got there
</p>
<p>speedily. I asked Fischer for an explanation as to the publication in our
</p>
<p>paper of the notice calling the people to arms, but he would give me no
</p>
<p>satisfaction."
</p>
<p>"Why did you not give me this statement first when I asked you for this
</p>
<p>information ? " asked Mr. Grinnell.
</p>
<p>"Because I was afraid it would hurt myself, or it might convict me.
</p>
<p>That is the reason why I did not tell you at first. I saw dynamite in the
</p>
<p>Arbeiter-Zeitung building. I saw dynamite lying on a shelf in the back room
</p>
<p>from the office. I know George Engel and Fehling. They printed the
</p>
<p>Anarchist. It was a small paper. They only published six numbers. "
</p>
<p>EDMUND DEUSS was also sought for with some interest. He had been
</p>
<p>city editor of the Arbeiter-Zeitung under Spies. The first week after the
</p>
<p>bomb had been thrown the authorities at police headquarters were informed
</p>
<p>that Paul Grottkau and Deuss, both ex-employe's of the Arbeiter-Zeitung,
</p>
<p>were then living in Milwaukee. Mr. Furthmann thought some points might
</p>
<p>be gathered from them, and accordingly went to that city. He found them
</p>
<p>both. Grottkau, who has since tasted the bitterness of prison life for his
</p>
<p>preachments of violence in the " Cream City," expressed himself as pleased
</p>
<p>that Spies had been placed under arrest and charged with responsibility for
</p>
<p>the murder at the Haymarket.
</p>
<p>" I knew long ago," said Grottkau, "that August Spies would thus end
</p>
<p>his crazy and ambitious career."
</p>
<p>Grottkau and Spies had not been on very friendly terms since the latter
</p>
<p>had succeeded in displacing the former from the editorship of the Arbeiter-
</p>
<p>Zeitung. But, however strong his enmity, Grottkau would not give us any
</p>
<p>information regarding Spies, or dynamite practices, or anything else that

</p>
<p>would tend to put a rope around Spies' neck or hurt any of his companions.
</p>
<p>He referred Mr. Furthmann to Deuss, who was then depending upon
</p>
<p>Grottkau for a livelihood and who received a dollar now and then for writ-
</p>
<p>ing a firebrand article for a paper Grottkau was editing in Milwaukee.
</p>
<p>Deuss was found in a neighboring saloon without a cent in his pocket.
</p>
<p>He stood wistfully eyeing the saloon patrons, hoping to fall in with some one
</p>
<p>willing to buy him a glass of beer or a cigar. Mr. Furthmann at once opened
</p>
<p>a conversation about the Chicago Anarchists. Deuss promised to tell every-
</p>
<p>thing he knew in regard to the Arbeiter-Zeitung, the dynamite brought
</p>
<p>IMPORTANT CLUES.
</p>
<p>177
</p>
<p>there, the men in the building of that paper and the nefarious things prac-
</p>
<p>ticed by them, on condition that Mr. Furthmann would first buy him a
</p>
<p>good cigar, several sandwiches and the necessary beer. The conditions
</p>
<p>were complied with, and Deuss rattled away a long story. He proved to
</p>
<p>be the first man to inform Mr. Furthmann as to when the dynamite that
</p>
<p>was afterwards found in the Arbeiter-Zeitung had been brought there, and
</p>
<p>where it had been placed. A grease-spot caused by dynamite was after-
</p>
<p>wards found exactly where Deuss said the explosive material had been
</p>
<p>placed, which was right next to the desk used by Malkoff, a reporter for the
</p>
<p>paper and an exiled Russian Anarchist. Rau at that time, it appears, did
</p>
<p>not know the properties of dynamite, for on one occasion a stray match was
</p>
<p>thrown upon the dynamite sack in the office and he was nearly frightened
</p>
<p>out of his wits.
</p>
<p>" Don't you know what you are doing ? " he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>" You greenhorn," was the answer, " Malkoff has handled this stuff for
</p>
<p>years and knows by this time, as you ought to know, that dynamite cannot
</p>
<p>be exploded by contact with fire in such a form."
</p>
<p>This information, though unimportant on its face, assisted Mr. Furth-
</p>
<p>mann greatly in making Deuss talk, and served also as a straw showing that
</p>
<p>the man had given up all the information he possessed.
</p>
<p>So FAR Mr. Furthmann had managed to secure many valuable clues, and
</p>
<p>we studied at once the best method of following
</p>
<p>them up. In running down the pointers, one day
</p>
<p>Mr. Furthmann sought Dr. Newman, one of the
</p>
<p>surgeons who had rendered heroic service in attend-
</p>
<p>ing the wounded on the night after the explosion.
</p>
<p>The doctor was asked with reference to the metal
</p>
<p>and pieces of lead which he had taken from the
</p>
<p>bodies of some of the men wounded at the Hay-
</p>
<p>market. He informed Mr. Furthmann that a young
</p>
<p>man named Hahn, a shoemaker on the West Side,
</p>
<p>had come to the hospital wounded by the explosion,
</p>
<p>and that upon examination a wound had been found

<p>in the fleshy part of his thigh, from which a piece of
</p>
<p>iron had been removed. This piece was nothing
</p>
<p>less than the nut which had been used to assist in
</p>
<p>holding together the two halves of the composition bomb which had been
</p>
<p>exploded at the Haymarket. This discovery was a most important one.
</p>
<p>It proved at the trial the best piece of evidence used by the prosecution,
</p>
<p>as it demonstrated that the bomb exploded at the Haymarket was one of
</p>
<p>the bombs manufactured by Louis Lingg, since fifty bolts and nuts of the
</p>
<p>same size and description were subsequently found in Lingg's possession.
</p>
<p>LINGG'S CANDLESTICK.
</p>
<p>From a Photograph.
</p>
<p>178 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>The metal removed from the person of the wounded officers was placed
</p>
<p>in the hands of Professors Haines and Delafontaine, expert chemists, for
</p>
<p>analysis, and they found that it contained the same quantity of lead, zinc,
</p>
<p>tin and other ingredients, and the same proportion of impurities as the bombs
</p>
<p>found in Lingg's possession. Even a trace of the copper discovered in the
</p>
<p>bomb exploded at the Haymarket was shown to have come from the candle-
</p>
<p>stick used by Lingg. A small fragment was missing from the candlestick,
</p>
<p>and it was clearly shown that it had found its way into that deadly bomb.
</p>
<p>During this period I also learned that Lingg had not been the first and
</p>
<p>only one to experiment with dynamite in Chicago. I learned that as far
</p>
<p>back as 1881 there had been some desperate men among the Socialists, but
</p>
<p>by keeping their secrets to themselves they had managed to keep the
</p>
<p>general body of the party and the public at large in ignorance of their
</p>
<p>clandestine operations. They had even experimented with dynamite, hop-
</p>
<p>ing to perfect it so that it could be handled with safety; but somehow they
</p>
<p>had failed to discover means for making its use practicable. They had
</p>
<p>adopted various expedients to test its strength when confined in a small
</p>
<p>implement, and in their labors several had' received serious injuries. Four
</p>
<p>or five men are living to-day who were crippled by the rash and ineffectual
</p>
<p>experiments. One Communist was particularly active in studying the prop-
</p>
<p>erties of the explosive and devising a plan to make it serviceable in a com-
</p>
<p>bat with the police. This man had fled from France after the downfall of
</p>
<p>the Paris Commune, a-nd thought himself quite capable of getting dynamite
</p>
<p>down to such a fine point that when his new-found brethren in Anarchy
</p>
<p>started their revolution they would be more successful than his French asso-
</p>
<p>ciates had been. He finally succeeded in making an explosive similar to
</p>
<p>dynamite, but which was found very unsafe to handle. After some of the
</p>
<p>Anarchists had tried it and got hurt, they refrained from further meddling,
</p>
<p>and dropped both the Frenchman and his explosive. For a long time there-
</p>
<p>after dynamite was not heard of.
</p>
<p>A man living on West Lake Street, however, still entertained hopes, and
</p>
<p>finally supplied some of the Anarchists with a dynamite prescription by
</p>
<p>which they could use it with great effect. In imparting his knowledge he
</p>
<p>told them to keep the "stuff" hermetically sealed, for if the air reached it

</p>
<p>an explosion would surely follow. Some found this true, to their sorrow.
</p>
<p>Then a man residing on West Twelfth Street stepped to the front and
</p>
<p>supplied what he claimed could be successfully used. One Sunday some
</p>
<p>half dozen Anarchists went out to Riverside to test the new compound by
</p>
<p>putting some of it under a lot of stone near the Desplaines River, but, to
</p>
<p>their surprise and mortification, they found that it was so weak that it
</p>
<p>scarcely made a noise.
</p>
<p>Subsequently the Southwest Side group took up the dynamite problem
</p>
<p>and experimented with the "stuff." The members of this group, known at
</p>
<p>EXPERIMENTING WITH DYNAMITE. 179
</p>
<p>the time familiarly as " the Bridgeport group," were the craziest lot of Anar-
</p>
<p>chists in the city, and, judging from their talk, were always ready to partici-
</p>
<p>pate in a riot or a revolution. They were great readers of books on
</p>
<p>Socialism, Communism, Anarchy and Nihilism, and they had drilled them-
</p>
<p>selves thoroughly in arms for the coming uprising. But they wanted some-
</p>
<p>thing more potent and effective than simple guns and revolvers, and, as they
</p>
<p>possessed a work on "The Wonders of Chemistry," they saw no reason
</p>
<p>why they could not carry out its instructions with reference to dynamite and
</p>
<p>find some means for putting them to practical use. They accordingly experi-
</p>
<p>mented. They had a friend in a drug-store on State Street, near Van
</p>
<p>Buren, and from him they obtained their supplies by paying a good round
</p>
<p>price. This store finally became known to all the Socialists in the city, but,
</p>
<p>as the owner became frightened at the publicity obtained, he declined to
</p>
<p>furnish any more material for experiments. The Anarchists, however, had
</p>
<p>met with some small success, and they were not discouraged. They found
</p>
<p>another friend on West Twelfth Street, and this party sold them dynamite
</p>
<p>cartridges such as are used by miners.
</p>
<p>There were in the city at the time the Bridgeport group, the Town of
</p>
<p>Lake group, the South Side group, the Southwest Side group, the Frei-
</p>
<p>heit group, the Northwest Side group, the North Side group, the Karl
</p>
<p>Marx group, the English group, the Lake View group (near Clybourn
</p>
<p>Avenue), and another group which existed only a short time, all together
</p>
<p>having a membership list of about 1,500 men, who hailed with great delight
</p>
<p>the report that with some further experiments the dynamite cartridges could
</p>
<p>be made serviceable not only for blowing up buildings, but also for use in
</p>
<p>a hand-to-hand conflict in a crowd.
</p>
<p>The members of the Lehr und Wehr Verein were not then interested
</p>
<p>in this branch of Socialism. They drilled with arms and believed in meeting
</p>
<p>the enemy with guns. It was about this time October, 1883 that the
</p>
<p>national convention of Socialists was held at Pittsburg to formulate plans and
</p>
<p>principles, and there was a division of sentiment on the use of dynamite.
</p>
<p>The radical delegates from Chicago, as stated in a preceding chapter, were
</p>
<p>numerous, and insisted on employing the most effective weapon they could
</p>
<p>find to exterminate capitalists. The result of the conflict was that on their

<p>return home they made it a point to bring over the members of the Lehr
</p>
<p>und Wehr Verein, some of whom had opposed them at Pittsburg, to their
</p>
<p>ideas, and some time thereafter they succeeded in having the superiority of
</p>
<p>dynamite over guns almost generally conceded. Not only that, but some of
</p>
<p>the members became enthusiastic in the experiments being made. One
</p>
<p>member had even reached a point beyond his competitors in making round
</p>
<p>cast-iron bombs, and succeeded in turning out fifty pieces. A few were
</p>
<p>tried, with what success is not known, but one night two friends of the man
</p>
<p>went to him, told him that they had heard of his having bombs and that his
</p>
<p>i8o ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>arrest would be made the next day. In fact, they assured him that
</p>
<p>he had been spotted for some time by detectives. This frightened the man,
</p>
<p>and he begged his friends to assist him in carrying the bombs away and thus
</p>
<p>help him out of his troubles. The three then went to work, removed the
</p>
<p>bombs, and, to effectually destroy all evidence, threw them into the lake.
</p>
<p>This procedure gave the great man of the Lehr und Wehr Verein a
</p>
<p>chance to breathe a little easier, the air seemed to be more bracing, and he
</p>
<p>could look into the eye of a policeman, when he passed one, with more
</p>
<p>assurance and confidence. But one of those bombs got astray while being
</p>
<p>removed, just before the others were submerged, and it afterwards came
</p>
<p>into the possession of the police. It has had its picture taken and looks
</p>
<p>quite innocent on paper. *
</p>
<p>An engraving of it is herewith presented. This sort of iron bomb was
</p>
<p>afterwards adopted as a model, and became quite popular with the brave
</p>
<p>dynamite experimenters until some one manufactured a- smaller one that
</p>
<p>could be carried handily in a coat pocket.
</p>
<p>They next adopted the long iron gas-pipe bomb, six inches in length,
</p>
<p>which could be carried in the inside vest pocket.
</p>
<p>Every one fell in love with the new invention, espe-
</p>
<p>cially Fischer, and he kept a large soap-box full of
</p>
<p>the bombs at his home, carefully concealed under his
</p>
<p>bed.
</p>
<p>But the Anarchists were bent on still greater
</p>
<p>improvements. They continued their experiments,
</p>
<p>and the next new invention was the round lead
</p>
<p>bomb, called by them the "Czar bomb." This was the kind brought
</p>
<p>to August Spies' office by "the man from Cleveland," or rather by
</p>
<p>Louis Lingg. One of these bombs is shown in a full-page engraving pre-
</p>
<p>sented elsewhere. They had been designated as the "Czar bomb" until
</p>
<p>bombs began to fill my office, and then they were referred to as "the
</p>
<p>round lead bombs." The police knew them as Lingg's bombs.
</p>
<p>Some of Fischer's bombs were scattered among trusted Anarchists in
</p>
<p>the Board of Trade procession, and their effectiveness would have been
</p>
<p>tried on that occasion had it not been for police interference. The char-

</p>
<p>SAMUEL FIELDEN was found at his home during the day of May 5th, and
</p>
<p>placed under arrest. He accepted the situation calmly, and, without a
</p>
<p>remonstrance, accompanied the officers to the Central Station. Officer
</p>
<p>Slayton, who had him in care, introduced him to the Lieutenant in charge of
</p>
<p>the detective department, and, in view of the conspicuous part the prisoner
</p>
<p>had played at the Haymarket, one would suppose that he would have been
</p>
<p>subjected to a very rigorous examination as to his movements for several
</p>
<p>SAMUEL FIELDEN.
</p>
<p>181
</p>
<p>days preceding the evening of May 4. But nothing of the kind occurred.
</p>
<p>The Lieutenant proceeded to denounce him in English more vigorous than
</p>
<p>elegant, and delivered himself of an opinion about the man and the work
</p>
<p>of the Anarchists at the Haymarket. Fielden stood it all without a mur-
</p>
<p>mur, and probably would have said nothing had not the Lieutenant called him
</p>
<p>a Dutchman. That allusion was the "last straw." Fielden remonstrated
</p>
<p>and emphatically declared that he was an Englishman. He was subse-
</p>
<p>quently turned over to Superintendent Ebersold, and, while exhibiting his
</p>
<p>wound, caused by a shot during the Haymarket riot, he was informed by
</p>
<p>that officer that it ought to have gone through his head. The observation
</p>
<p>was a pertinent one at the mo-
</p>
<p>ment, and possibly the felicity
</p>
<p>of its expression may have sat-
</p>
<p>isfied the official that with it
</p>
<p>his duty had ended in the case.
</p>
<p>At any rate, Fielden was not
</p>
<p>catechized to any material extent
</p>
<p>by the Chief, and that official, as
</p>
<p>well as the head of the detective
</p>
<p>department, was no wiser than
</p>
<p>before the man's arrest.
</p>
<p>The prisoner, who had been
</p>
<p>shown to have declared at the
</p>
<p>Haymarket, "Here come the
</p>
<p>bloodhounds, the police ; you do
</p>
<p>your duty and I'll do mine,"
</p>
<p>and to have fired a shot in the
</p>
<p>direction of the police after dis-
</p>
<p>mounting from the speakers'
</p>
<p>wagon, was then passed into a
</p>
<p>cell. His house was searched,
</p>
<p>but nothing of a criminating
</p>
<p>character was discovered. He undoubtedly possessed a great deal of infor-

<p>mation respecting the revolutionary plot. Had it not been for work done
</p>
<p>outside of the Central Station, Fielden would have been speedily released,
</p>
<p>and possibly some apology might have been offered him for the incon-
</p>
<p>venience occasioned by his arrest and the unintentional reflection cast upon
</p>
<p>the English and German nationalities.
</p>
<p>Fielden was kept locked up, indicted, and finally convicted on discoveries
</p>
<p>made independently of the Chief's office or the detective department. The
</p>
<p>education, demeanor and independence of the man were well calculated to
</p>
<p>deceive the most expert readers of human nature, and his emphatic asser-
</p>
<p>tions regarding the want of any knowledge of a conspiracy would have

</p>
<p>made him a free man to-day had his case rested on the efforts of the Central
</p>
<p>Station. Fielden was a sort of diamond in the rough. He possessed much
</p>
<p>native ability, a ruggedness of character which commanded admiration, and
</p>
<p>a force and volubility of speech which swayed the unlettered masses. Had
</p>
<p>he passed through either an academic or collegiate training, there is no tell-
</p>
<p>ing what eminence he might have achieved in the higher walks of life. His
</p>
<p>rough, uncouth appearance greatly heightened the effect of his utterances,
</p>
<p>as few looked for eloquence from such a man. He was born in Dod-
</p>
<p>morden, Lancashire, England, in 1847, and spent a number of his earlier
</p>
<p>years in a cotton mill. While thus engaged he became a Sunday-school
</p>
<p>teacher at the age of eighteen, and some time later branched out as an
</p>
<p>itinerant Methodist exhorter. Some time after (1868) he came to America,
</p>
<p>settling in New York, and the next year he found his way to Chicago. He
</p>
<p>went to work at Summit, a hamlet a few miles southwest of town, on the
</p>
<p>farm of ex-Mayor John Wentworth, but he did not remain there long before
</p>
<p>he migrated to Arkansas and Louisiana to engage in railroad construction
</p>
<p>work. In 1871 he returned to Chicago and engaged in manual labor, prin-
</p>
<p>cipally as teamster in handling stone. In 1880 he became a member of the
</p>
<p>Liberal League, and under the training and guidance of George Schilling
</p>
<p>he soon became a rabid Socialist. From that the step was only a short one
</p>
<p>to unbridled Anarchy, and the pupil finally became a teacher to Schilling in
</p>
<p>advanced theories on the state of society they all sought to inaugurate.
</p>
<p>Fielden finally became a boon companion of Spies and Parsons, and all the
</p>
<p>rugged eloquence he could command was given to the cause. He was a
</p>
<p>more forcible speaker than either of the two just named, and whenever he
</p>
<p>preached force, as he always did after becoming an Anarchist, his language
</p>
<p>commanded wider attention and made a deeper impression. Had it not
</p>
<p>been for his own sincere penitence for his past misdeeds and the interven-
</p>
<p>tion of influential friends because of that penitence, he would have died on
</p>
<p>the gallows. But he recanted at the last moment of hope for clemency, and
</p>
<p>the Governor commuted his sentence to imprisonment for life. He is a

</p>
<p>I HAVE often been asked how it was that I came to have charge of the
</p>
<p>detective work which was done in bringing the Anarchists to justice, and
</p>
<p>I think that the time has now come for the whole story to be told. I think
</p>
<p>it would be a false delicacy for me, in this book, which I mean to make, as
</p>
<p>nearly as I can, a fair and truthful record of the Anarchist case, to pass over
</p>
<p>the notorious incompetency which prevailed at Police Headquarters at that
</p>
<p>time. It cannot be denied that, had the case been left in the hands of the
</p>
<p>men of the Central Office, the prosecution would have come to naught, and
</p>
<p>these red-handed murderers would have gone unwhipped of justice. This
</p>
<p>was something which every good citizen would have been bound to prevent,
</p>
<p>and more than others a police officer, for into our hands is intrusted the
</p>
<p>care of the lives and property of the community and the preservation of la-w
</p>
<p>and order. I knew as well as my questioners that the case belonged to the
</p>
<p>Central Office. There was the Chief ; there were the two heads of the detec-
</p>
<p>tive department ; there was the detective corps, supposed to contain the
</p>
<p>keenest and the best officers on the force.
</p>
<p>From the first I was satisfied that the men at headquarters neither
</p>
<p>appreciated the gravity of the occasion, nor were they able to cope with the
</p>
<p>conspirators -a set of wily, secret and able men, who had made a special
</p>
<p>study of the art and mystery of baffling the law and avoiding the police.

</p>
<p>There was neither order, discipline nor brains at headquarters. Every
</p>
<p>officer did as he liked, and the department was rent and paralyzed with the
</p>
<p>,euds and jealousies between the chiefs and the subordinates. This, too,
</p>
<p>was at a time when the people of Chicago were in a condition of mind
</p>
<p>almost bordering upon panic. They were looking to us for protection,
</p>
<p>red flag was flaunted in the streets, demagogues were shouting dynamite in
</p>
<p>a dozen parts of the city, riotous mobs had already met the police and the
</p>
<p>183
</p>
<p>184
</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>police were in charge of a man who it is a charity to say no more had
</p>
<p>neither a proper conception of his duties nor the ability to perform them.
</p>
<p>For instance, on the evening of May 3 all the captains of the city were
</p>
<p>ordered to meet at the Chief's office, and, together with Inspector Bonfield,
</p>
<p>they responded promptly. While the situation was being discussed, there
</p>
<p>was a rap at the door. I was nearest the entrance, and I opened it. Mr.
</p>
<p>Hanssen, one of the editors of the Freie Presse, was there. He handed in a
</p>
<p>paper, saying that it was of most serious import so serious that, as soon as
</p>
<p>he had seen it, he had felt it his duty to bring it to police headquarters. It
</p>
<p>was the " Revenge " circular, of which so much is said elsewhere in this
</p>
<p>book, and which afterwards became so notorious. I handed it to Chief
</p>
<p>Ebersold, who glanced at it and said it was all nonsense. " Why," said he,
</p>
<p>" we are prepared for them." Bonfield looked it over, and thought it serious.
</p>
<p>I was sure that it meant mischief and murder,
</p>
<p>but the rest treated it as a farce. Now, what
</p>
<p>was to be expected from men who had no clearer
</p>
<p>idea of the gravity of the crisis that was upon
</p>
<p>us than the story of this incident conveys.
</p>
<p>On the next evening the crash of dynamite
</p>
<p>was for the first time heard on the streets of an
</p>
<p>American city. The Red Terror was upon us.
</p>
<p>What was done ?
</p>
<p>Every citizen of Chicago demanded justice
</p>
<p>for the brave men who had fallen justice on
</p>
<p>the miscreants who had done them to death.

</p>
<p>concluded, the events of that day, the 5th of May, would have fastened the
</p>
<p>determination in my mind. At ten o'clock in the morning I was ordered by
</p>
<p>telephone to report at the Central Station at once with two companies

</p>
<p>trouble was momentarily expected on the Black Road. When I had disposed
</p>
<p>my men at the City Hall, and arranged for the patrol wagons we were to
</p>
<p>occupy if a call should come, there was nothing to do but wait in the Chief's
</p>
<p>office till we were summoned. No one ever had a better opportunity of
</p>
<p>seeing how the police business of the city was transacted.
</p>
<p>It was a time of acute excitement, the day after the Haymarket. The
</p>
<p>Chief was in a state of alarm that would have been ridiculous if it had not
</p>
<p>been pitiable. Whenever the telephone rang, he would start nervously and
</p>
<p>demand, "Is that on the prairie, or the Black Road?" and when assured
</p>
<p>that there was no trouble, his relief was absurdly manifest. Among the
</p>
<p>POLITICS AND JEALOUSY.
</p>
<p>185
</p>
<p>detectives the topic was whether they would be called on to work in the
</p>
<p>Anarchist case and how many they would be expected to arrest.
</p>
<p>Another question that bothered them was : What would the old man
</p>
<p>(Mayor Harrison) say if they went to work arresting Anarchists, and how
</p>
<p>would he like it ?
</p>
<p>The officers who did their duty after such a stupendous crime as the
</p>
<p>slaughter of the police officers would never have lost anything in the end,
</p>
<p>even if they should have lost their positions. The question, " How would
</p>
<p>Harrison like it ? " as asked by one of the detectives, should, therefore, have
</p>
<p>cut no figure, and possibly it did not. Probably the officer fell back upon it
</p>
<p>as an excuse for his own laziness and incompetence. But one thing is cer-
</p>
<p>tain, and that is that the department did BBfratoffia... v^ * ; "li
</p>
<p>nothing to speak of in the case.
</p>
<p>I saw some of those red-handed mur-
</p>
<p>derers come out of that office smiling
</p>
<p>and laughing instead of being made to
</p>
<p>feel that they were about to have a rope
</p>
<p>around their necks.
</p>
<p>In fact, the Central Office was run so !
</p>
<p>that no one could tell who was officer,
</p>
<p>waiter or janitor. Everybody had a full
</p>
<p>sweep in and out of the office, and if a
</p>
<p>prisoner happened to be brought in by
</p>
<p>some well-meaning officer, everybody
</p>
<p>was allowed to hear the investigation.
</p>
<p>It was a sort of town meeting, and it
</p>
<p>was free to all.
</p>
<p>At that time Inspector Bonfield had
</p>
<p>been receiving a great deal of favorable
</p>
<p>mention in the newspapers, in connec-
</p>
<p>tion with the labor troubles, and this aroused the jealousy of Chief Eber-
</p>
<p>sold. The Chief accordingly concluded to attend to all the business himself,
</p>
<p>assisted by his pet gang of ignorant detectives, and they made a fine mess

</p>
<p>of it. But forces were at work, in spite of the internal difficulties, which
</p>
<p>rescued the case from utter failure.
</p>
<p>On the morning of May 5, at an early hour, Inspector Bonfield had a
</p>
<p>short interview with State's Attorney Grinnell ; but exactly what transpired
</p>
<p>no one but themselves knew. Before noon of that day, however, the result
</p>
<p>could be plainly seen. Officers James Bonfield, Palmer, Slayton and a few
</p>
<p>others had by that time succeeded in arresting August Spies, Chris Spies,
</p>
<p>Schwab, Fischer and Fielden. Of course, this step only served to create
</p>
<p>more jealousy in the Central Station.

<p>After the prisoners had been brought in, some of the newspaper report-

<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>ers endeavored to obtain interviews with them, but they were not permitted
</p>
<p>to get anywhere near the / narchists.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, and while the working officers were out hunting for
</p>
<p>more of the chief conspirators, the lieutenants in command of the detective
</p>
<p>department concluded that they would enjoy a little breathing-spell.
</p>
<p>Accordingly they took a stroll among the fashionable saloons on Clark
</p>
<p>Street. There they met their friends, and while sampling the various decoc-
</p>
<p>tions compounded by the cocktail dispensers, they fell in with a party of
</p>
<p>professional prize-fighters, heavy-weight and light-weight, and match-makers
</p>
<p>for man and beast. They found there was more sport in that party than in
</p>
<p>taking risks by going out into the suburbs through tough streets and dirty
</p>
<p>alley-ways looking for Anarchists.
</p>
<p>At any rate, after a lot of wine had been consumed and good cigars
</p>
<p>tested, round after round, one of the pug-faced
</p>
<p>sluggers made the remark to one of the lieu-
</p>
<p>tenants that he would like to see the Anar-
</p>
<p>chists who had been arrested, and the officer
</p>
<p>addressed responded: "Of course you can
</p>
<p>see them all you gentlemen can see them.
</p>
<p>Come right along with us."
</p>
<p>They all fell into line, went over to the
</p>
<p>Central Station, were taken down stairs to the
</p>
<p>lock-up, and there told to go around and look
</p>
<p>for themselves. This was some time after
</p>
<p>nine o'clock in the evening, and after the
</p>
<p>part)' had satisfied their curiosity, they returned
</p>
<p>to the saloon which they had left. The vigi-

</p>
<p>and, holding a short conference, they resolved to insist on seeing the pris-

</p>
<p>know about the parties arrested as a gang of prize-fighters, whether Sulli-
</p>
<p>vans or lesser lights in the prize-ring firmament, and the lieutenants at once
</p>
<p>recognized the force of the argument. Between eleven and twelve that

<p>night one reporter from each paper in the city was allowed to see the
</p>
<p>Anarchists, and interviews were secured for publication the next morning.
</p>
<p>When I understood how the whole affair was being managed during that
</p>
<p>day, I came to the conclusion that the case would never be worked up by
</p>
<p>that department, and I was more resolved than ever that if the opportunity
</p>
<p>came I would not rest until the criminals were brought to justice.
</p>
<p>Inspector Bonfield had likewise become disgusted with the nervous
</p>
<p>actions of the Chief and the heads of the detective department, and he
</p>
<p>decided to confine his operations to the West Side. He went over there
</p>
<p>that day, May 5, and as a result he cleaned out all Lake Street from
</p>
<p>A FRIENDLY TIP. 187
</p>
<p>the river to Halsted Street. He broke up all the Anarchist rendezvous,
</p>
<p>captured their guns, confiscated their flags, and created general dismay
</p>
<p>among the reds. Some sought safety by fleeing to the roofs, others escaped
</p>
<p>through back alleys, and still others got into the dark recesses of basements.
</p>
<p>When they learned that " Black " Bonfield, as they called him, was on their
</p>
<p>track, consternation took possession of them all. The Inspector had no
</p>
<p>easy task. He looked up all their halls and meeting-places, hunted for
</p>
<p>"Revenge" circulars at every place he visited, and in every instance he
</p>
<p>found plenty of them as evidence of the extensive circulation given that
</p>
<p>document among Anarchists. He gathered them all together, and in the
</p>
<p>trial they proved of great service to the State as showing that all had
</p>
<p>notice to come to the Haymarket meeting with arms and be prepared for a
</p>
<p>deadly conflict. After that day Inspector Bonfield turned all his attention to
</p>
<p>the sick and wounded officers and their families, and, as a consequence, the
</p>
<p>Central Station was left without a competent head. But the Central con-
</p>
<p>sidered itself capable of handling the case, and Bonfield never asked any
</p>
<p>questions. Ebersold and the dual-headed monstrosities in charge of the
</p>
<p>detective department struggled along, and, with a great deal of bluster,
</p>
<p>endeavored to show to the outside world that they were moving along finely.
</p>
<p>But they accomplished absolutely nothing. Insults in various ways were
</p>
<p>heaped upon Bonfield, so that every one about the City Hall noticed them.
</p>
<p>Even on the 5th of May, the slights cast upon the Inspector were com-
</p>
<p>mented upon by some of the officers in the Central. Some of the officers
</p>
<p>friendly to the incompetents would declare that Bonfield did not know his
</p>
<p>business and that he was to blame for the killing of the officers, but there
</p>
<p>were others who took a different view and regretted that he was not kept con-
</p>
<p>tinually at work on the case. In fact, the only ones about the building,
</p>
<p>after the incompetent heads took charge, who showed a willingness to work
</p>
<p>and who tried to do their duty, were Officers James Bonfield, Palmer and
</p>
<p>Slayton. All the rest looked scared, absent-minded and indifferent.
</p>
<p>On the next morning May 6 I was again at the Central Headquar-
</p>
<p>ters. I learned then how deep and wide-spread was the spirit that per-
</p>
<p>vaded the department. Nothing was done, and nothing was proposed to
</p>
<p>be done. I also learned of the treatment accorded Officer Palmer by the

<p>lieutenants in charge of the department.
</p>
<p>The whole trouble appeared to be that no one cared about doing any-
</p>
<p>thing, and that if any one had the temerity to bring information in, he would
</p>
<p>be kicked out. While such was the stupidity or the lethargy of the head
</p>
<p>officials, I was powerless to act. I could not take the case away from my
</p>
<p>superior officer on information rejected and spurned by those in authority
</p>
<p>about police headquarters, and I almost despaired of ever seeing the culprits
</p>
<p>brought to punishment.
</p>
<p>An incident occurred, however, which changed the whole course of
</p>
<p>1 88 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>events. On my way home to supper that evening, about six o'clock May
</p>
<p>6 I met a man near my house. He acted as though greatly frightened,
</p>
<p>but he had some information he wished to impart to me. He was afraid to
</p>
<p>speak, as he said it was life or death to him.
</p>
<p>"If I speak," he said, "and these people [the Anarchists] find it out,
</p>
<p>they will kill me sure. On the other hand, when I think of how many
</p>
<p>were killed, it drives me nearly crazy. I can probably help to bring the
</p>
<p>murderers to justice, and I cannot forgive myself unless I try to assist."
</p>
<p>I told the man that as a good citizen it was his duty to tell everything
</p>
<p>he knew about the affair, and that I should consider everything he said
</p>
<p>strictly confidential. My personal pledge being given to him that I would
</p>
<p>not get him into trouble by exposing him to the reds, he began his statement.
</p>
<p>The man did not tell very much, but after I had gathered together all
</p>
<p>the little threads carefully, the whole proved of considerable service. After
</p>
<p>supper I went to a great many places and remained out till four o'clock the
</p>
<p>next morning. The following day I instructed some of my people how to
</p>
<p>get information respecting the throwing of the Haymarket bomb, and I told
</p>
<p>them where they might leave their information if they obtained any. I got
</p>
<p>back to the station at 9 A.M., and found in my closed letter-box a slip of
</p>
<p>paper containing about five lines of important news. I scanned the paper
</p>
<p>closely, and those who stood around told me afterwards that they noticed
</p>
<p>that my face brightened up considerably.
</p>
<p>I knew then that I had a very light starter in the case, but a good one.
</p>
<p>I could readily see also that everything had to be handled with the greatest
</p>
<p>care, and by preserving the utmost confidence with the informers. I knew,
</p>
<p>too, that nothing must be told even in the Chief's office or in the detective
</p>
<p>department.
</p>
<p>I had previously discovered that there was not a man among tne tnree
</p>
<p>heads of the Central that knew how to listen to information, how to put
</p>
<p>questions or remember conversation, or, in fact, to have anything in shape,
</p>
<p>or to keep secrets, and I therefore decided to keep my own counsel.
</p>
<p>On the morning of the yth of May, at nine o'clock, I arrived at the Chief's
</p>
<p>office and asked him if he had any good news. He replied that it was hard
</p>
<p>to get at the bottom of the affair. I then asked him if he would give me

</p>
<p>the privilege of working up the case. He looked at me a moment and then
</p>
<p>said, "Yes."
</p>
<p>"Yes, Captain," he added, after a brief pause, "I will sure. If you
</p>
<p>can do anything, do it. I hope you will do it. I shall be pleased if you
</p>
<p>can only do it."
</p>
<p>I then said : "With your permission I will work this case and all there
</p>
<p>is in the case. You will hear from me soon, but if you should not hear from
</p>
<p>me in three months, do not ask for me. I am going to work night and day
</p>
<p>until this case is cleared up. Good day."
</p>
<p>PREPARING FOR WORK.
</p>
<p>189
</p>
<p>Then I started for the North Side. Arriving at the station, Lieut.
</p>
<p>Larsen handed me a little note which had been left for me. It was small,
</p>
<p>but full of information, and was the first fruit of one night's work. I imme-
</p>
<p>diately turned over the command of the station and all the details to Lieut.
</p>
<p>Larsen, and at once called in my old reliable officers, those whom I knew to
</p>
<p>be honest and true, strong and vigilant, intelligent and brave. They began
</p>
<p>earnestly and were with me through all the investigations up to November
</p>
<p>n, 1887. They were Michael Whalen, John Stift, Michael Hoffmann,
</p>
<p>CHAS. REHM.
</p>
<p>JOHN STIFT. JACOB LOEWENSTEIN.
</p>
<p>Hermann Schuettler, Jacob Loewenstein and Charles Rehm, and they
</p>
<p>reported to me promptly at the office, where they received their first instruc-
</p>
<p>tions. I told them that this must be like all the other cases we had worked,
</p>
<p>secret and only known among ourselves. All information and reports must
</p>
<p>come to me as soon as possible, and all details must be attended to strictly.
</p>
<p>I further told them that they must expect a forty-eight hours' stretch of work
</p>
<p>frequently before we got to the end ; that they must keep in mind that
</p>
<p>their lives would often be in danger, but they should only kill in dire neces-

</p>
<p>sity. Insults or abuses they must not take from any one. I knew that
</p>
<p>igo ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>they would get into many of those h 1-holes, where the women were a
</p>
<p>great deal worse than the men, and I proposed that the officers should show
</p>
<p>that they were not to be trifled with in the discharge of their duties.
</p>
<p>The field chosen for work was the vicinity of Clybourn Avenue, Sedg-
</p>
<p>wick Street and North Avenue. The officers were provided with chisels,
</p>
<p>jimmies and keys and one or two dark lanterns, and after these preliminary
</p>
<p>arrangements they mounted a patrol wagon and started for the scene of
</p>
<p>their operations. This detail was in charge of Officer Whalen, and the first
</p>
<p>objective point was Sedgwick Street, near the residence of Seliger. They
</p>
<p>began searching all the houses, barns and wood-sheds belonging to Anar-
</p>
<p>chists, and created quite a consternation in the locality.
</p>
<p>While they were thus engaged, I was temporarily called away from my
</p>
<p>office, and on my return I was soon called up by a telephone message from
</p>
<p>the Larrabee Street Station. Answering the call, I recognized the voice
</p>
<p>of Officer Whalen, and some important news was at once communicated.
</p>
<p>"We have found the bomb factory," said Officer Whalen. "It is in the
</p>
<p>rear of No. 442 Sedgwick Street. The house is full of bombs and all kinds
</p>
<p>of material. My men are all there, and I am almost afraid to touch any
</p>
<p>of the stuff. There are some very queer-looking things, besides round lead
</p>
<p>bombs and very long iron bombs, about the house, and probably some trap
</p>
<p>may have been set to blow us all up the moment the articles are disturbed."
</p>
<p>I questioned him as to whether there was any one about the house, and,
</p>
<p>being answered in the negative, I instructed the officer to handle everything
</p>
<p>himself and exercise great caution. Everything that looked suspicious was
</p>
<p>to be packed in a box and sent to the Chicago Avenue Station. I further
</p>
<p>instructed the officer to hunt up the parties who lived there, place them
</p>
<p>under arrest and send them also to the same station.
</p>
<p>Whalen then returned to the house, packed up all the "stuff" and
</p>
<p>hunted for the occupants, who were nowhere to be found. He ascertained
</p>
<p>their names, however, and learned from the neighbors that the head of the
</p>
<p>house worked in Meyer's Mill, a sash and door factory on the North Pier.
</p>
<p>This information was telephoned to me, and I instructed Lieut. Larsen just
</p>
<p>what I desired in the way of securing the man's arrest. The Lieutenant
</p>
<p>called up the Larrabee Street Station patrol wagon, and, with a number

</p>
<p>of officers, he repaired to the mill. He there found his man, William
</p>
<p>Seliger, and brought him to the Chicago Avenue Station.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Officer Whalen and his men were busy getting their load of
</p>
<p>deadly missiles, and, still unsatisfied, they got some shovels and picks and
</p>
<p>went to mining in the back yard of the bomb factory. They found a lot of
</p>
<p>lead and gas pipes buried in the ground, and after they had collected about
</p>
<p>all the suspicious-looking articles they could find, they brought it all to the
</p>
<p>station. This was the first of a series of searches kept up night and day
</p>
<p>for two weeks, and no house or place where an Anarchist or Socialist
</p>
<p>AN OPENING TO THE CASE.
</p>
<p>191
</p>
<p>resided escaped police attention. The houses were examined from top
</p>
<p>to bottom, and when the officers had finished their labors in this direc-
</p>
<p>tion the Chicago Avenue Station was filled with all kinds of arms, some
</p>
<p>old and some new, nearly every nation on the globe being represented in
</p>
<p>the collection.
</p>
<p>On the evening of May 7, about eight o'clock, a gentleman called at my
</p>
<p>house, and in a most confidential manner desired to post me about an arrest
</p>
<p>that ought to be made.
</p>
<p>"You had a fellow taken from Meyer's Mill," said he, "but you left a
</p>
<p>man worse than the one you arrested." He gave the name of the party and
</p>
<p>then silently took his departure.
</p>
<p>On the next day Officer
</p>
<p>Whalen was detailed to bring
</p>
<p>the man to the station, but when
</p>
<p>the officers arrived at the mill
</p>
<p>the bird had flown. This man's
</p>
<p>name was Mueller, No. 2. He
</p>
<p>has never returned to the fac-
</p>
<p>tory, although his tool chest is
</p>
<p>still there, and $27 still stands
</p>
<p>due to him on the books of the
</p>
<p>concern to this date.
</p>
<p>With the information so far
</p>
<p>secured I became confident that
</p>
<p>I had an opening to the case,
</p>
<p>but, knowing that no aid could
</p>
<p>be had from the Central Head-
</p>
<p>quarters, I refrained, I think
</p>
<p>wisely, from asking for assist-
</p>
<p>ance. In Mr. Grinnell and his
</p>
<p>staff, however, I had every con-
</p>
<p>fidence, and I went to his office. I told him what discoveries had been
</p>
<p>made, giving him all the details, and said to him that in working up the

</p>
<p>case I should frequently need his advice. He promptly said : "Schaack,
</p>
<p>you can command my services and those of every man in my office at any
</p>
<p>time." I thanked him, and felt greatly strengthened in the task I had
</p>
<p>before me.
</p>
<p>Mr. Furthmann was directed to go with me and assist in the same
</p>
<p>way that he had assisted in working up the evidence in the Mulkowsky
</p>
<p>murder case.
</p>
<p>I then felt highly gratified, and stronger and more resolute than
</p>
<p>ever, because of my new partner in the case. When we were about to go,
</p>
<p>Mr. Grinnell said, "I will be up to-night and see you." He called, as
</p>
<p>EDMUND FURTHMANN.
</p>
<p>I 9 2 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>promised. We then told him what progress we had made during the day,
</p>
<p>and he expressed himself as greatly pleased. He urged us to keep every-
</p>
<p>thing as secret as possible and not to take any more people into our con-
</p>
<p>fidence than was absolutely necessary. Having given us this advice, he left
</p>
<p>us, but we continued our work until three o'clock the next morning. We
</p>
<p>met again Furthmann and myself the next day at nine o'clock, and that
</p>
<p>day we worked with great success. The boys brought us in good news
</p>
<p>every hour. Good citizens would leave letters at my house, and these would
</p>
<p>be immediately sent to me by my wife. Before eight o'clock that night we
</p>
<p>had gained an entrance to the conspiracy plot. Mr. Grinnell was sent for,
</p>
<p>and he called on us at once. He was informed of all the facts and said :
</p>
<p>"You boys have done well. You have found the missing link, and you
</p>
<p>have it right."
</p>
<p>Mr. Grinnell became enthusiastic over the work accomplished and recog-
</p>
<p>nized the fact that the right parties were under arrest, and that what had
</p>
<p>been morally certain before as to a conspiracy had now been made a legal
</p>
<p>certainty susceptible of the strongest proof. In reaching this point, a great
</p>
<p>deal of work had been done, and in " its performance talent, tact and
</p>
<p>ingenuity of a very high order seemed essential. Mr. Grinnell inspired us
</p>
<p>with confidence, however, and was kind enough to say, just before going
</p>
<p>home that night :
</p>
<p>" Schaack, I want to say that you are one of the greatest detectives in
</p>
<p>America."
</p>
<p>When the case had been worked up to the discovery of the leading facts
</p>
<p>at this time, the reporters for the various papers in Chicago began to gather
</p>
<p>at the Chicago Avenue Station, and they plied me with all sorts of questions.
</p>
<p>They desired all the information I possessed, but their laudable ambition
</p>
<p>was not gratified. Nothing respecting the merits of the case was furnished
</p>
<p>them. This provoked quite a number of the newspaper craft, and they
</p>
<p>sought to even up things by scoring rne and my assistants in the columns of
</p>
<p>their papers. They continued their attacks, evidently expecting that I would
</p>
<p>weaken and tell all I knew, but in this they were mistaken, as their shafts
</p>
<p>fell harmless at my feet.
</p>
<p>The more the papers blamed us, the better we liked it. It made our

</p>
<p>work much easier, because we received a great deal of good information
</p>
<p>from persons who would not have told us anything without positive assur-
</p>
<p>ance of secrecy.
</p>
<p>This was in fact a potent factor in our success, and the newspaper-read-
</p>
<p>ing public really lost nothing by it. The latest news respecting the
</p>
<p>Anarchist conspiracy was always presented by the dailies, and, while there
</p>
<p>may have been wanting many of the essential and interesting facts, the
</p>
<p>public demand was measurably satisfied. At any rate, the interests of
</p>
<p>justice could not be permitted to be overshadowed by those of the news-

</p>
<p>193
</p>
<p>papers, and I held unflinchingly to the course mapped out until the day of
</p>
<p>the trial. The result proved the wisdom of the plan, and the encomiums
</p>
<p>bestowed on me by the press on the evidence I finally accumulated more
</p>
<p>than offset the former bitter attacks.
</p>
<p>Had it not been for the caution and secrecy which we made our rule all
</p>
<p>through the investigation, the plot would not have been successfully unrav-
</p>
<p>eled. Recognizing this trait in my management of the case, men close to
</p>
<p>the Anarchists
</p>
<p>gave points they
</p>
<p>otherwise would
</p>
<p>not have dared to
</p>
<p>give, and there

<p>was scarcely an

<p>that I did not

<p>find some trails

</p>
<p>would meet me

<p>hand me letters
</p>
<p>and pass right

<p>were purposely

<p>other, and working up everything, something tangible was generally produced.
</p>
<p>In many of the notes a few words would signify a great deal, and the clues
</p>
<p>would be run down to the last point. Of course, sometimes the detectives
</p>
<p>made long and weary walks with no results. But whenever the boys met with
</p>
<p>disappointments in not getting just what they expected, and even when they
</p>
<p>were kept up all night, they never grumbled or expressed dissatisfaction.

<p>194 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>On the morning of May 8, at eight o'clock, we all met for general consulta-
</p>
<p>tion behind locked doors in an inner room, and, while thus occupied with
</p>
<p>the case, I was notified that a lady desired to see me on important business.
</p>
<p>I immediately responded, and as I entered the main office I was confronted
</p>
<p>by a woman very heavily veiled. She briefly stated her mission and said
</p>
<p>that she desired an interview in private. I took her into another office, and,
</p>
<p>after the door had been locked, she said :
</p>
<p>" You must excuse me. I will not uncover my face. Don't ask me any-
</p>
<p>thing about myself, and I will tell you something."
</p>
<p>She was a German lady, well educated, and she spoke in an earnest,
</p>
<p>truthful manner. Being assured that no questions would be asked to
</p>
<p>establish her identity, she then told me where to send and what would be
</p>
<p>found at the indicated place. Before making her exit she remarked :
</p>
<p>" You will have to attend to this matter this very day and before four
</p>
<p>o'clock."
</p>
<p>Her information proved highly interesting and valuable, and I thanked
</p>
<p>her for it. In less than half an hour one of the detectives was set to work
</p>
<p>on her " pointers," and before two o'clock he returned to the station with "a
</p>
<p>good fat bird " and a lot of new evidence. Who the lady was is a mystery.
</p>
<p>She left the station as mysteriously as she had entered.
</p>
<p>In the evening of the same day we met again and put together the
</p>
<p>results of each one's investigations. The work accomplished was surpris-
</p>
<p>ing to all. Mr. Grinnell called, and, seeing what had been done, was more
</p>
<p>than pleased. At this time we had some of the Anarchists already behind
</p>
<p>the bars. That night we worked until two o'clock the next morning, and it
</p>
<p>was half an hour later when I directed my steps homeward. As I neared
</p>
<p>my house, I saw the indistinct outlines of a man standing close to a large
</p>
<p>bill-board about ten feet north of my residence. The figure proved to be
</p>
<p>a tall man, and, as I came to a halt, the stranger spoke up in German :
</p>
<p>"Is this Mr. Schaack?"
</p>
<p>"I am," I replied, "and what are you doing standing there?"
</p>
<p>The stranger asked me to wait for a moment, and I complied, hardly
</p>
<p>knowing what to make out of the man's intentions toward me at such an
</p>
<p>unseemly hour in the morning; but at the same time I kept my eye steadily

</p>
<p>upon him for any hostile demonstrations. The strange individual hurriedly
</p>
<p>placed a cloth of some sort over his face, and I began to think some Anar-
</p>
<p>chist had been commissioned to murder me. Still, the coolness and self-
</p>
<p>possession of the man and the seeming absence of the usual bluster
</p>
<p>incident to the commission of a foul crime reassured me. Noticing all
</p>
<p>this, by way of making the man understand that I was prepared for him if
</p>
<p>he had any murderous intentions, I said : " If you make any attack upon
</p>
<p>me I will kill you dead ! "
</p>
<p>" Mein Gott, nein. I only want to tell you something," was the reply.
</p>
<p>A MYSTERIOUS INFORMER.
</p>
<p>195
</p>
<p>I told him that that was all right and asked him into the back yard,
</p>
<p>when he said he would talk to me. I made the stranger go ahead of me,
</p>
<p>and when we reached the yard the man gave me a long story.
</p>
<p>"I dare not," said he, "write to you. I dare not come near you dur-
</p>
<p>ing the day-time. I don't want you to know me, but I think you are the
</p>
<p>right man to talk to. I would not talk to any one else."
</p>
<p>During the whole conversation the man kept his improvised mask on,
</p>
<p>and made it clear that his motive in so doing was to prevent the possibility
</p>
<p>of his being made to appear
</p>
<p>in court to verify the state-
</p>
<p>ments he desired to communi-
</p>
<p>cate. He gave information
</p>
<p>mainly bearing on the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy meeting which had
</p>
<p>been held on the evening of
</p>
<p>May 3, at No. 54 West Lake
</p>
<p>Street, and the interview
</p>
<p>lasted until about three
</p>
<p>o'clock.
</p>
<p>When we parted I was no
</p>
<p>wiser as to his identity than
</p>
<p>I had been before, and to this
</p>
<p>day I don't know with whom
</p>
<p>I talked there in my back
</p>
<p>yard that early morning.
</p>
<p>In the forenoon of the gth
</p>
<p>of May my trusted assistants
</p>
<p>again met in the office to com-
</p>
<p>pare notes. At this meeting I
</p>
<p>told Mr. Furthmann what a
</p>
<p>ghost I had seen that night,
</p>
<p>and in our deliberations that
</p>
<p>ghost aided us a great deal.

<p>As a result the detectives
</p>
<p>started out with new instruc- A BACK-YARD INTERVIEW.
</p>
<p>tions, and they were ordered to be back at the office at one o'clock in the after-
</p>
<p>noon. All reported promptly except a few who had struck a good trail and
</p>
<p>who kept out until six o'clock. The reports of those present showed good
</p>
<p>results. They started out again at two o'clock with new instructions and
</p>
<p>were ordered to report as soon as they had completed their work. Between
</p>
<p>three and five o'clock that afternoon things became exceedingly lively. The
</p>
<p>Anarchists began to move about like hornets disturbed in their nest, and
</p>
<p>some jumped around as if charged with electricity. Towards six o'clock the
</p>
<p>196 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>detectives reported back to the office, and an exchange of notes showed
</p>
<p>that it had been a day more fruitful of results than the day preceding. I
</p>
<p>found that a strong chain had been wrought connecting all the leading
</p>
<p>Anarchists in Chicago with the Haymarket murder, and I knew that no
</p>
<p>mistakes had been made in the arrest of those who had already been
</p>
<p>locked up.
</p>
<p>During the same evening Mr. Grinnell and Mr. George Ingham gave
</p>
<p>me a call, and anxiously inquired about the progress made in the case.
</p>
<p>Mr. Grinnell assured Mr. Furthmann and myself that Mr. Ingham was all
</p>
<p>right, being with them, and with this statement all the facts were laid
</p>
<p>before them.
</p>
<p>When the whole situation had been explained, Mr. Ingham said :
</p>
<p>"Mr. Grinnell, now you have a case."
</p>
<p>"George," replied Mr. Grinnell, "up to the time when Capt. Schaack
</p>
<p>began his work I had no case whatsoever. I would have been laughed out
</p>
<p>of court, but now I say we have a good, strong case, and it will be in
</p>
<p>excellent shape. The boys are making it stronger every day. They have
</p>
<p>got things down fine, and they are going to bring out everything there is
</p>
<p>in it."
</p>
<p>We worked that night until one o'clock, and met again the next morn-
</p>
<p>ing at eight, vigorous and keen for further developments. At this time we
</p>
<p>had our hands full, with an abundance of material on which to work. Dur-
</p>
<p>ing the night several letters were dropped in my letter-box, and they all
</p>
<p>contained good news. Some of the letters were somewhat obscure, their
</p>
<p>import having to be guessed at from suggestive circumstances, but they
</p>
<p>nevertheless helped. With fresh instructions the detectives started out
</p>
<p>for the day and reported back at one o'clock as per orders. Everything
</p>
<p>was discovered to have worked well. About two o'clock a man was noticed
</p>
<p>standing across the street from the station. His actions were somewhat
</p>
<p>strange, and one of the officers remarked that the fellow appeared to be
</p>
<p>watching the building very closely. I told the officer to keep watch of him,
</p>
<p>and in the event of his walking away to follow him. The man did not
</p>
<p>move, and as he remained there for nearly half an hour I ordered the officer
</p>
<p>to go across the street and ascertain what the stranger was watching. The

</p>
<p>man declined to speak at first, but, after the officer had threatened to lock
</p>
<p>him up, he stated that he desired to see me, but did not want to go into the
</p>
<p>building. He then requested the officer to tell me that he would meet me
</p>
<p>at the corner of La Salle and Chicago Avenues, and I was so notified.
</p>
<p>I started at once to see the man, but as soon as lie saw me he started
</p>
<p>off. When he got to the corner he turned north on La Salle Avenue, and
</p>
<p>I followed. When I got within twenty feet of him he looked around, and
</p>
<p>then dropped a letter, pointing his fingers to it as he passed on, without
</p>
<p>stopping. I picked up the letter and went back to the station. This letter

</p>
<p>contained very important matter and kept us busy for two days. This man
</p>
<p>was a stranger to me. I had never seen him before to my knowledge, and I
</p>
<p>have never seen him since.
</p>
<p>After this day the office had all it could do and all the information it
</p>
<p>needed. After six days and nights of hard and exacting labor, the real
</p>
<p>troubles of all engaged in the case began. The newspapers now appreciated
</p>
<p>the work accomplished, and they were not slow to bestow great praise upon
</p>
<p>all connected with the case. This did not please Mr. Ebersold, the Chief,
</p>
<p>and on the nth of May he sent for me to report at once.
</p>
<p>The moment I entered the office at the Central Station I saw that there
</p>
<p>was "fire in the eye " of the
</p>
<p>Superintendent, and the
</p>
<p>atmosphere was somewhat
</p>
<p>above the boiling-point.
</p>
<p>"Are you Chief of Po-
</p>
<p>lice or am I ? " broke in Mr.
</p>
<p>Ebersold, in a gruff, blus-
</p>
<p>tering manner, the moment
</p>
<p>I had set my foot inside ot
</p>
<p>the private office.
</p>
<p>"You are," said I, "or
</p>
<p>at least you are supposed
</p>
<p>to be. I certainly don't
</p>
<p>desire to be."
</p>
<p>This shot did not con-
</p>
<p>tribute anything to the
</p>
<p>comfort of the Chief, and
</p>
<p>he grew hotter than ever ?
</p>
<p>and desired me to under-
</p>
<p>stand that he was the Chief, and no one else. Mr. Ebersold then pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to unburden his mind. He said that his friends had told him that
</p>
<p>they had thought he was Chief, but since they had not seen his name pub-
</p>
<p>lished in connection with the case, they had reached a different conclusion.

</p>
<p>He further stated that ministers even, and professors, too, and other peo-
</p>
<p>ple, had come to him and said that "Capt. Schaack was getting too much
</p>
<p>notoriety." He declared that he wanted me to stop the newspapers writing
</p>
<p>anything more about me and to let the credit be given to the head of the
</p>
<p>department.
</p>
<p>"I want this thing stopped ! " declared the Chief, as he struck the desk
</p>
<p>vigorously with his fist and glowered savagely at me.
</p>
<p>I told him that I had not asked any newspaper to write me up and I
</p>
<p>would not tell any of them to stop, simply because it was not my business.

</p>
<p>to be set at naught by the incompetents then at the head of what was
</p>
<p>facetiously called the defective department. I therefore took occasion to
</p>
<p>say, just before leaving the Chief's presence, that, now that I had opened up
</p>
<p>the case, I proposed to finish it, even if I did not remain on the force one
</p>
<p>day after my work had been fully accomplished. A day or two after this
</p>
<p>interview I met Mr. Grinnell and related the circumstances. The State's
</p>
<p>Attorney said :
</p>
<p>" Captain, you are doing well ; you keep on and work just as you have
</p>
<p>been doing."
</p>
<p>During the afternoon of May 10, the detectives of the Chicago Avenue
</p>
<p>Station discovered a lot of bombs, guns and revolvers, which they brought
</p>
<p>to the station. They also arrested a few Anarchists, who pretended to be
</p>
<p>as harmless and spotless as little lambs, but who, before they went to sleep
</p>
<p>that night in our hotel, discovered that they had a great many black spots
</p>
<p>on them. The force continued at work till three o'clock the next morning.
</p>
<p>The following day they met again at eight o'clock in the morning, and sev-
</p>
<p>eral arrests were made that day.
</p>
<p>At about this time the mail was burdened with a great many letters,
</p>
<p>some very encouraging in the cheering and complimentary sentiments they
</p>
<p>conveyed, and others very threatening in their character. The latter class
</p>
<p>were full of most dire menaces, suggesting all sorts of torture in the event
</p>
<p>that I did not stop prosecuting the Anarchists, and the whole formed a very
</p>
<p>interesting collection. It was evident that many of them had been written
</p>
<p>by cranks, and that some bore marks of having been inspired by religious
</p>
<p>enthusiasts. One wrote that enough men had already been killed without
</p>
<p>hunting for innocent men as a sacrifice for the Haymarket murder, and
</p>
<p>another wrote urging that the whole lot of the Anarchist brood be hung as
</p>
<p>fast as they could be arrested. Several drew on their imaginations and
</p>
<p>volunteered "pointers" which bore on their face evidences of falsehood.
</p>
<p>Others would say that their prayers were constantly with the police in their
</p>
<p>efforts, and expressed a hope that out of it all might come the extirpation
</p>
<p>of Anarchy from American soil. These communications poured in upon
</p>
<p>me in such numbers that I had no time to read them through, and even the
</p>
<p>most savage and bloodthirsty hardly gave me a moment's thought.

<p>As a matter of fact I was never for a moment alarmed about my own per-
</p>
<p>sonal safety. All of the letters I received I filed away, and some day, when
</p>
<p>I do not know what else to do to amuse myself, I purpose to run them over
</p>
<p>again and enjoy another hearty laugh. Meanwhile Anarchist after Anar-
</p>
<p>chist was overhauled, and after one clue had been worked out another was
</p>
<p>undertaken with the utmost secrecy. The detectives continued persistently
</p>
<p>at work, and for two months they carefully kept their own counsel, never
</p>
<p>permitting themselves to be drawn into conversation by outsiders respect-
</p>
<p>ing the case.
</p>
<p>THREATENING LETTERS. 199
</p>
<p>Their experience was highly exciting at all times, and the various haunts
</p>
<p>of the Anarchists were kept in a lively commotion. The social miscreants
</p>
<p>never knew when the investigations would end, and they were in constant
</p>
<p>dread. Finding that threats upon the lives of State's Attorney Grinnell,
</p>
<p>Assistant State's Attorney Furthmann, myself, and the officers engaged in
</p>
<p>the case, had failed to have the desired effect, they turned their attention to
</p>
<p>writing letters to our wives. These letters were written in a most vindictive
</p>
<p>and fiendish spirit. They threatened not only bodily harm to these ladies,
</p>
<p>but promised to inflict death by horrible tortures upon their husbands and
</p>
<p>children, if the prosecution was not dropped ; and they vowed vengeance
</p>
<p>also upon property by the use of explosives that would leave to each house
</p>
<p>only a vestige of its former location. Some of these letters were general
</p>
<p>in their character, and others particularized the kind of death in store for
</p>
<p>all engaged in the case. One said that on some unexpected day we would
</p>
<p>be blown to atoms by a bomb ; another pictured how a husband would be
</p>
<p>brought home in a mangled, unrecognizable mass. Still another would
</p>
<p>suggest that, if a husband proved missing, his remains might be looked for
</p>
<p>fifty feet under the water, firmly tied to a rock or a piece of iron. Another,
</p>
<p>again, stated that on the first opportunity the husband would be gagged,
</p>
<p>bound hand and foot, and placed across some railroad track to horribly con-
</p>
<p>template death under the wheels of a fast approaching train. Still another
</p>
<p>would say: "When your husband is brought home be sure and pull the
</p>
<p>poisoned dagger out of his body." One writer penned a tender epistle and
</p>
<p>closed by urging the mother to be sure to "kiss your children good-by
</p>
<p>when you leave them out on the street." One letter was written with red
</p>
<p>ink and stated that "this blood is out of the veins of a determined man
</p>
<p>that would die for Anarchy." One man expressed sorrow for the woman
</p>
<p>and then concluded : " But we cannot help this. If you have any property
</p>
<p>you had better have a will made by your liege lord to yourself, because he
</p>
<p>is going to die so quick that he will not know that he ever was alive."
</p>
<p>Another said : "Take a good description of your husband's clothes. He
</p>
<p>will be missing before long, and probably after some years you will hear
</p>
<p>that in some wild forest a lot of clothes have been found tied to some tree,
</p>
<p>and these clothes will be stuffed with bones."

</p>
<p>Epistolary threats of this kind were sent almost daily to the wives of
</p>
<p>the officers and officials, and, if published, the collection would form a
</p>
<p>volume in itself. The threats I have given are only a tithe of the whole,
</p>
<p>but I have given enough to illustrate the general trend of the letters. We
</p>
<p>paid no attention to them, but the women, of more delicate and sensitive
</p>
<p>disposition, took them more to heart. The constant receipt of such letters
</p>
<p>naturally made a deep impression on their minds, and some of the ladies
</p>
<p>had dark forebodings. But the officers always took a cheerful view, and
</p>
<p>urged that it was only cowards who resorted to threats. They still con-
</p>
<p>200 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>tinued their work, undaunted by these denunciations and menaces, and
</p>
<p>frequently remained out all night in their work in some of the most desper-
</p>
<p>ate districts of the city, sometimes keeping up forty-eight hours at a stretch.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Schaack, a generally strong and courageous woman and deeply
</p>
<p>interested in all my work, did not bear up as well as some of the others
</p>
<p>under the pressure. She had been sick for over eight months, and, when these
</p>
<p>letters began to reach her, she had just reached a convalescent state. Hav-
</p>
<p>ing thus passed through a long siege of illness, her system was in a highly
</p>
<p>nervous condition, and it was, therefore, quite natural that sometimes she
</p>
<p>should become greatly solicitous for my personal safety whenever a very
</p>
<p>savage and gory letter accidentally reached her eye. When the trial finally
</p>
<p>began, I begged her to take the three children and visit for two months a
</p>
<p>place six hundred miles away from Chicago, where she could not only
</p>
<p>enjoy a comparative serenity of mind, but build up her shattered constitu-
</p>
<p>tion, under more favorable circumstances and climatic conditions. She
</p>
<p>acted on my advice. While away, she was in constant receipt of such
</p>
<p>letters as were calculated to make her reassured as to my comfort, and she
</p>
<p>rapidly gained in health and strength.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Grinnell bore up remarkably well under the severe strain. She
</p>
<p>had come in for a goodly share of these murder-threatening letters, but,
</p>
<p>being blessed with good health and strong nerves, she never displayed
</p>
<p>signs of weakness.
</p>
<p>She was a brave lady. Whenever I saw her with Mr. Grinnell, she
</p>
<p>would always say: "Captain, I want you and Mr. Grinnell and all the boys
</p>
<p>to keep on with your noble work." She at all times appeared very pleasant
</p>
<p>and not the least disturbed.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Furthmann was not overlooked by the letter-writers, but her
</p>
<p>husband arranged matters so that their epistles did not fall into her hands.
</p>
<p>He would gather them in, and, with what the mail brought him every day
</p>
<p>for his own individual benefit, he had plenty of hair-raising literature.
</p>
<p>But he paid no attention to the threats and never for a moment relaxed
</p>
<p>his efforts on account of them. These letters became so numerous and fre-
</p>
<p>quent that after a time the officers would jestingly allude to them as their
</p>
<p>" love letters."

</p>
<p>But the Anarchists did not stop with writing letters. One night they
</p>
<p>held a small meeting in the rear room of a saloon on North Avenue, and
</p>
<p>there was a great deal of talk and bluster about what they ought to do to
</p>
<p>" bring the officials to their senses." One suggested that they should blow
</p>
<p>up the house of Officer Michael Hoffman, but that officer appears to have
</p>
<p>had a friend there. That friend opposed the plan and said :
</p>
<p>" Cowards, if you want to do anything, why don't you meet the man
</p>
<p>himself and attack him ? Why do you seek to hurt his wife and innocent
</p>
<p>children?"
</p>
<p>IN TIMID A TION AND ARSON. 201
</p>
<p>This appealed to their sense of humanity, and they at once decided to
</p>
<p>abandon the scheme. Finally one cut-throat arose, and, in a braggadocio
</p>
<p>style, broke out, in a loud, coarse and beer-laden voice :
</p>
<p>"Well, we will drop that plan, but you all know where he lives and we
</p>
<p>all have bombs yet. Any one that does not care for a screeching woman
</p>
<p>or squealing young ones, let him go and see the shingles fly off the
</p>
<p>roof."
</p>
<p>On a subsequent night about two o'clock in the morning a carriage
</p>
<p>drove up to the officer's house, and one of the occupants shouted out,
</p>
<p>"Mike!" The officer drew to the window, and his wife opened it. At
</p>
<p>first, mistaking her for the officer, they halloaed, " We only want to see you
</p>
<p>for a moment." When the woman asked what was wanted they said, "We
</p>
<p>don't want to see you. Where is Mike?" Being informed that he was
</p>
<p>not at home, one of the burly fellows said, just as the carriage started away,
</p>
<p>"A d d good thing for him that he is not at home."
</p>
<p>This band of intimidators and cowards did not overlook me. On two
</p>
<p>occasions they sought to burn my house, but each time they were foiled in
</p>
<p>their attempt. They sneaked, true to their nature, into the back yard, and
</p>
<p>started a fire by means of a kerosene-saturated torch or by the use of an
</p>
<p>explosive. The fires, however, failed to do any damage.
</p>
<p>When the trial of the arch-conspirators began, these same unpunished
</p>
<p>red-handed cranks began to give their attention to Judge Gary and his
</p>
<p>wife. They fairly overwhelmed them with letters of a most threatening
</p>
<p>character, and whenever there was any ruling of the court which they re-
</p>
<p>garded as inimical to their friends' interests, they were particularly vitu-
</p>
<p>perative. But throughout the whole trial neither the Judge nor his wife
</p>
<p>was at all intimidated. They paid no attention to them, and nearly every
</p>
<p>day Mrs. Gary sat by the side of her husband on the bench, giving the
</p>
<p>strictest attention to the proceedings. She was there in the forenoon and
</p>
<p>in the afternoon. When the two went out to lunch together, a detec-
</p>
<p>tive would always follow them, without their request or knowledge, and the
</p>
<p>same course would be pursued when they went home at night or came
</p>
<p>down in the morning. I had this done as a precautionary measure, as
</p>
<p>there was no telling at that time but what some demented Anarchist might

</p>
<p>seek vengeance upon the Judge for some fancied wrong to the defendants.
</p>
<p>Sometimes, after lunch, Mrs. Gary would return in the company of some
</p>
<p>lady friends, but she would invariably, after an exchange of pleasantries
</p>
<p>with them, rejoin her husband on the bench, where she would remain until
</p>
<p>the adjournment of court. Once in a while the Judge would find a
</p>
<p>moment's interval to talk to her, and the devoted appearance of the vener-
</p>
<p>able couple formed a most pleasing and picturesque background to the
</p>
<p>crowded and excited court scene throughout the trial. She was there dur-
</p>
<p>ing all the arguments, and listened most intently to the reading of the
</p>
<p>202 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>verdict which finally sent the defendants to the gallows. From the begin-
</p>
<p>ning of the trial to its end she never displayed a sign of weakness or fear.
</p>
<p>While the investigations were in progress, and even during the trial, a
</p>
<p>lot of cranks and desperate men flocked into the city from outside points,
</p>
<p>and there was no telling what villainous deeds they might perpetrate and
</p>
<p>then escape undetected. For this reason I thought it prudent to place a
</p>
<p>watchman at the house of every one actively engaged in the case, and both
</p>
<p>night and day the lives as well as property of all were closely watched to
</p>
<p>prevent the execution of any of the numerous threats made against the
</p>
<p>officials by the red-handed fiends. The attempt on my own house was
</p>
<p>made before these guards were placed, but after that there was no trouble.
</p>
<p>The Anarchists, seeing the precautions that had been taken, gave the houses
</p>
<p>no further attention, and thereafter vented their spleen in denunciatory
</p>
<p>letters.
</p>
<p>From the very start of the investigations, I engaged the services of pri-
</p>
<p>vate men to work under my instructions, and they invariably submitted
</p>
<p>their reports to me at my house. They never called at the house without
</p>
<p>first notifying me, and this notification would be by means of a sign at a
</p>
<p>place near my residence. I would always look at the spot before entering
</p>
<p>the house, and if I found the sign, I would also find my man in the
</p>
<p>vicinity.
</p>
<p>I would then go upstairs, fix the rooms so that no one could see who
</p>
<p>might enter, and leave a sign at the window. In a few minutes my friend
</p>
<p>would appear at the door. Not one of my officers ever knew any of these
</p>
<p>men so employed, but they knew the officers.
</p>
<p>Many funny incidents naturally grew out of this situation. It was very
</p>
<p>amusing to listen to the officers. One would tell me: "I saw such and such
</p>
<p>a fellow, a rank Anarchist, on the street to-day in company with a
</p>
<p>stranger," or : "I saw a couple of them in such and such a saloon together,
</p>
<p>and one of them had a stranger with him, who looked like a wild Anar-
</p>
<p>chist." Then the officers would describe the fellow, and one of them would
</p>
<p>say:
</p>
<p>" I know he is an Anarchist. He and the stranger walked around the
</p>
<p>jail building, and the next time I meet that stranger I will bring him in. It

</p>
<p>will do no harm to give him a few days' entertainment in the station. I
</p>
<p>want to introduce him to you. I bet you will keep him, and you can, no
</p>
<p>doubt, learn something from him. I think he is a stranger in the city, and
</p>
<p>he is here for no good purpose."
</p>
<p>The officer was bound to bring him in, and this placed me in a rather
</p>
<p>awkward position. All I could do, however, was to say, "Don't be too
</p>
<p>hasty ; wait till you find him connected with others."
</p>
<p>This worked well for a while, but after a time some of these men who
</p>
<p>were in my secret service were brought in. One morning I arrived at the
</p>
<p>MISTAKEN IDENTITY.
</p>
<p>203
</p>
<p>station and found that they had been locked up in a cell. As they had
</p>
<p>received at the start rigid instructions not to reveal their identity under any
</p>
<p>circumstances, they did not send for me the moment they were arrested,
</p>
<p>and so they had to remain until the next day, when I promptly released
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>At one time, one of these privates reported to me that he had seen a
</p>
<p>fellow around with some of the worst Anarchists in the city, that every one
</p>
<p>regarded him as sound in the Anarchist faith, and that he and the others
</p>
<p>were in Chicago to liberate the Anarchists from the jail. The private fur-
</p>
<p>ther stated that the stranger had never been seen except in the company of
</p>
<p>old-time revolutionists.
</p>
<p>That was enough for the
</p>
<p>detective to warrant ar-
</p>
<p>rest. I told him to make
</p>
<p>the fellow's acquaint-
</p>
<p>ance and draw him out,
</p>
<p>but be in no haste. A
</p>
<p>few days later, the de-
</p>
<p>tective reported that he
</p>
<p>had spoken to the
</p>
<p>stranger and that he
</p>
<p>would become well ac-
</p>
<p>quainted with him
</p>
<p>shortly.
</p>
<p>At this time every
</p>
<p>Anarchist resort was
</p>
<p>watched very closely.
</p>
<p>I told the private to ascer-
</p>
<p>tain where the stranger
</p>
<p>lived, but he must not
</p>
<p>push himself too rapidly
</p>
<p>forward ; he must make
</p>
<p>an engagement to meet

<p>the man in the evening
</p>
<p>and stay with him as late as possible. Just as soon as they parted,
</p>
<p>he was to double back on the stranger and follow him. A few nights
</p>
<p>later the private reported again and said that they had been together
</p>
<p>one evening for three hours, when they parted on the corner of Madison
</p>
<p>and Canal Streets. He told the stranger that he would go back to the
</p>
<p>South Side, and then, by following him after parting, he found that the
</p>
<p>stranger started north. The man turned on Lake Street west and entered
</p>
<p>No. 71 West Lake Street, one of the worst Anarchist resorts in the city.

<p>This place was kept by a man named Floras, a rank " red." The private

</p>
<p>closed his saloon ; but no one came. The next day the private reported
</p>
<p>the facts to me, and said that the stranger evidently had a room at Florus'
</p>
<p>house. I told the private to try and get the stranger on the North Side so
</p>
<p>that I could have a look at him. He started out to hunt up his friend.
</p>
<p>On the evening of that same day, detective No. 2 reported. He said
</p>
<p>that he had a fellow spotted whom he described as one of a gang that
</p>
<p>had come from St. Paul. He remarked that the fellow was very sharp, but
</p>
<p>not sharp enough for him. He also stated that the stranger appeared to
</p>
<p>like him, but that he did not trust him very much.
</p>
<p>No. 2 further said: "I have been around with him
</p>
<p>every evening. He is very good company, and I am sure
</p>
<p>that he is an Anarchist. But I can't get at his motives."
</p>
<p>I then told him to get the man up here on the North
</p>
<p>Side where I would be able to see him.

<p>I said that I would always be at the station from one

<p>to three o'clock, so as

<p>to take a look at the
</p>
<p>man when they passed.
</p>
<p>On the next day I
</p>
<p>was on the look-out,

<p>but no one came. The

<p>Wells Street, and on
</p>
<p>the same side where
</p>
<p>the station is located. They were engaged in conversation, and neither
</p>
<p>looked aside as they passed. I got up on the steps of the front entrance
</p>
<p>and remained there as they came by. They had no sooner got past, when
</p>
<p>the fellow on the inside lifted his hand to the right hip, and after a few
</p>
<p>steps further the other fellow put his left hand behind his back and worked
</p>
<p>his fingers thus each man giving the tip on the other. They proceeded
</p>
<p>towards the Water-works.
</p>
<p>When all this was over, I almost fell in a fit laughing at the joke. It
</p>
<p>was extremely ludicrous, but I had to keep it all to myself. The privates

<p>kept at work, but I did not tell either the occupation of the other. I had
</p>
<p>promised every man in my employ that I would not give him away, and I
</p>
<p>kept my word. One of these detectives had been assigned for duty north
</p>
<p>of Kinzie Street on the West Side, and the other had been set to work par-
</p>
<p>ticularly along Lake Street. By invitation of some Anarchists on Mil-
</p>
<p>waukee Avenue, the detective in the district north had left his field and
</p>
<p>gone with them to the halls of the ''reds" on Lake Street, and in this way
</p>
<p>the two detectives had made each other's acquaintance and got mixed up.
</p>
<p>I was now in a predicament to straighten matters out and prevent the men
</p>
<p>from wasting time on each other. I finally told each separately that the
</p>
<p>other was working for Billy Pinkerton, and that he should pay no more
</p>
<p>attention to him. This worked satisfactorily. Now and then I received a
</p>
<p>report stating that my detective had seen that Pinkerton man at such or
</p>
<p>such a place. This will be the first time, however, that either one knows
</p>
<p>the other's exact identity, and they can now laugh over their mixed-up

</p>
<p>IN the light of all the facts that have developed, I do not believe that it is
</p>
<p>too large a statement, nor too egotistical, to say that, but for the work
</p>
<p>done at the Chicago Avenue Station, the Anarchist leaders would soon
</p>
<p>have been given their liberty, and Anarchy would have been as rampant as
</p>
<p>ever in Chicago worse indeed than before ; for the conspirators would
</p>
<p>then have despised as well as hated the law. What the work was, the
</p>
<p>reader will better understand after he has gone through this and the suc-
</p>
<p>ceeding chapters.
</p>
<p>I did not depend wholly upon police effort, but at once employed a
</p>
<p>number of outside men, choosing especially those who were familiar with
</p>
<p>the Anarchists and their haunts. The funds for this purpose were supplied
</p>
<p>to me by public-spirited citizens who wished the law vindicated and order
</p>
<p>preserved in Chicago. I received reports from the men thus employed
</p>
<p>from the beginning of the case up to November 20, 1887. There are 253 of
</p>
<p>the reports in all, and a most interesting history of Chicago Anarchy do they
</p>
<p>make even in themselves.
</p>
<p>They always conveyed important information and gave valuable clues.
</p>
<p>They confined their efforts wholly to Anarchists, and their principal duty
</p>
<p>was to ascertain if the reds intended to organize again for another riot or
</p>
<p>an incendiary attempt upon the city. They were also to learn if steps
</p>
<p>were contemplated to effect the rescue of the Anarchists who were locked
</p>
<p>up in the County Jail, and whether they were getting up any further murder

</p>
<p>plots. At each Anarchist meeting I had at lea^t one man present to note
</p>
<p>the proceedings and learn what plots they were maturing. Generally before
</p>
<p>midnight I would know all that had transpired at meetings of any impor-
</p>
<p>tance. From many meetings I learned that the Anarchists were discussing
</p>
<p>plans to revenge themselves on the police, but in each case, as soon as they
</p>
<p>were about to take some definite action, some one would move an adjourn-
</p>
<p>ment or suggest the appointment of a committee to work out the plan in
</p>

</p>
<p>some better shape. When the next meeting was held the fellows who had
</p>
<p>done the loudest shouting would be absent, and then those who happened
</p>
<p>to be on hand would vent their wrath upon the absentees by calling them
</p>
<p>cowards. In many of the smaller meetings held on Milwaukee Avenue or
</p>
<p>in that vicinity, a lot of crazy women were usually present, and whenever a
</p>
<p>proposition arose to kill some one or to blow up the city with dynamite,
</p>
<p>these "squaws" proved the most bloodthirsty. In fact, if any man laid
</p>
<p>out a plan to perpetrate mischief, they would show themselves much
</p>
<p>more eager to carry it out than the men, and it always seemed a pleasure to
</p>

</p>
<p>the Anarchists to have them present. They were always invited to the
</p>
<p>"war dances." Judge Gary, Mr. Grinnell, Mr. Bonfield and myself were
</p>
<p>usually remembered at these gatherings, and they fairly went wild whenever
</p>
<p>bloodthirsty sentiments were uttered against us. The reporters and
</p>
<p>the so-called capitalistic press also shared in the general denunciations. At
</p>
<p>one meeting, held on North Halsted Street, there were thirteen of these
</p>
<p>creatures in petticoats present, the most hideous-looking females that could
</p>
<p>possibly be found. If a reward of money had been offered for an uglier set,
</p>
<p>no one could have profited upon the collection. Some of them were pock-
</p>
<p>marked, others freckle-faced and red-haired, and others again held their

</p>
<p>208 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>appeared at one of these meetings with her husband's boots on, and there
</p>
<p>was another one about six feet tall. She was a beauty ! She was raw-
</p>
<p>boned, had a turn-up nose, and looked as though she might have carried
</p>
<p>the red flag in Paris during the reign of the Commune.
</p>
<p>This meeting continued all right for about two hours Then a rap came
</p>
<p>on the locked door. The guard reported that one of their cause desired
</p>
<p>admittance, giving his name at the same time, and the new arrival was
</p>
<p>permitted to enter. He was a large man with a black beard and large eyes,
</p>
<p>and very shabbily dressed. He looked as though he had been driving a
</p>
<p>coal cart for a year without washing or combing. He also had the appear-
</p>
<p>ance of being on the verge of hydrophobia. As soon as he reached the
</p>
<p>interior of the hall he blurted out hastily, in a loud voice :
</p>
<p>" Ladies and brothers of our cause ! Please stop all proceedings I am
</p>
<p>out of breath I will sit down for a few minutes."
</p>
<p>All present looked at the man with a great deal of curiosity and patiently
</p>
<p>waited for him to recover his breath. The interval was about five minutes.
</p>
<p>Then the stranger jumped up and said :
</p>
<p>"I am from Jefferson. I ran all the way [a distance of five miles]. I
</p>
<p>was informed that you were holding a meeting here this evening, and that
</p>
<p>there is a spy in your midst."
</p>
<p>At this bit of information every one became highly excited, and the
</p>
<p>stranger immediately proceeded to inquire if there was any one they suspected.
</p>
<p>They all looked at each other, and, becoming satisfied that they were all
</p>
<p>friends of Anarchy, waited for the man to give them more precise informa-
</p>
<p>tion. The stranger then continued :
</p>
<p>"The man is described to me, and that is all I know."
</p>
<p>He looked around for a moment and finally said, pointing to the man
</p>
<p>addressed :
</p>
<p>"If I am not damnably mistaken, you are the man ! " At the same time
</p>
<p>he ordered the guard to lock the door and pull out the key.
</p>
<p>"Now," he resumed, addressing the man to whom he had pointed, who
</p>
<p>was none other than a detective in my service, "you will have to give a good
</p>
<p>account of yourself."
</p>
<p>This placed my man in a rather embarrassing position, but he was equal

</p>
<p>to the emergency.
</p>
<p>"I am an Anarchist," he spoke up promptly, in a loud, clear and firm
</p>
<p>tone of voice, " and I have been one for years, and you are simply one of
</p>
<p>those Pinkerton bummers. What business have you here in our meetings,
</p>
<p>I would like to know. The other day I passed Pinkerton's office. I was
</p>
<p>sitting in a car, and I saw you coming down stairs. I suppose you met some
</p>
<p>fool that gave you a little information so as to get in here. All you want to
</p>
<p>know evidently is how many are present here, and, if possible, learn what

</p>
<p>209
</p>
<p>we are doing. You get out of here in five seconds, or I will shoot you down
</p>
<p>/ike a rat."
</p>
<p>The officer then pulled out of his pocket a large revolver, and, brand-
</p>
<p>ishing it in the air, asked :
</p>
<p>"Shall I kill that bloodhound?"
</p>
<p>The women cried out in a chorus: "Yes, yes ; kill him !" The men,
</p>
<p>however, did not like the proposition. One of them said : "Don't kill him
</p>
<p>TURNING THE TABLES.
</p>
<p>here ; take him out somewhere else and shoot him. " This seemed to meet
</p>
<p>with general approval.
</p>
<p>The turn of affairs completely surprised the stranger, and he became so
</p>
<p>frightened that he could not speak. No one in the meeting knew him, and
</p>
<p>he was powerless to speak in his own defense. The officer held his revolver
</p>
<p>directed at the man's face and kept toying with it in the vicinity of his nose.
</p>
<p>Finally the fellow stammered out :
</p>
<p>" I am all right, and you will find me out so."
</p>
<p>At last the women again broke in, with a demand that the intruder be
</p>
<p>immediately ejected, and the men responded promptly by kicking him out
</p>
<p>of the door. He had no sooner reached the outside than he started on a
</p>
<p>keen run, in momentary dread of his life, and he kept up his rapid gait until

</p>
<p>he thought he was at a safe distance.
</p>
<p>2 1 o ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>The officer was then the hero of the moment, but he recognized the fact
</p>
<p>that he himself was not absolutely safe after this episode. It occurred to
</p>
<p>him that possibly the stranger might hunt up some one on Milwaukee
</p>
<p>Avenue who could identify him and assure the meeting that he was
</p>
<p>a true and reliable Anarchist, and thus turn the tables against the
</p>
<p>officer. The moment, therefore, he had regained his seat, he decided to
</p>
<p>resort to strategy, and said :
</p>
<p>"We will have to adjourn at once. This fellow will run to the station-
</p>
<p>house and bring the patrol wagon with a lot of- officers, and we will all be
</p>
<p>arrested."
</p>
<p>In less than three minutes the meeting adjourned, and then the officer
</p>
<p>advised them all to go home immediately and not to remain a second if they
</p>
<p>did not desire to be arrested. The Anarchists did as he suggested, and
</p>
<p>scattered for home in a hurry.
</p>
<p>This detective did not attend any more of the meetings, but was con-
</p>
<p>tent in congratulating himself on having come out of that assembly without
</p>
<p>a bruise or a scratch.
</p>
<p>About January, 1887, one of my privates informed me that there was a
</p>
<p>place on Cly bourn Avenue where the Anarchists were accustomed to hold
</p>
<p>private meetings. He said that he could not get in as yet, and I told him
</p>
<p>to pick up some one whom he could work handily. He must first form the
</p>
<p>man's acquaintance, and then hang around the saloons in the neighborhood
</p>
<p>and read the Arbeit er-Zeitung. I gave him one of John Host's books and
</p>
<p>made him wear a red necktie. I advised him also to get about half drunk, sing
</p>
<p>the Marseillaise and curse the police. By so doing, I told him, it would not
</p>
<p>be long before he would find a partner. Several times subsequently the
</p>
<p>detective visited the Anarchist resorts, accompanied by a little boy who
</p>
<p>belonged to one of his friends, and in less than two weeks he had wormed
</p>
<p>himself into the confidence of the gang who frequented Clybourn Avenue.
</p>
<p>If any one asked him his name he would say :
</p>
<p>" I don't give my name to people I don't know. I am against law and
</p>
<p>order, and that is sufficient. I don't believe in having good men hung to
</p>
<p>satisfy the rich. They will not hang if I can help any."
</p>
<p>For the first couple of weeks, the newly formed friends of this detective

</p>
<p>would not take him to any of their meetings. I advised him not to make
</p>
<p>inquiries. As soon as they thought him all right, they would speak
</p>
<p>themselves. Within three weeks some one took him to a meeting and
</p>
<p>vouched for him as being true to their cause. At the first meeting he
</p>
<p>attended he saw that he was as intelligent as any one of them, and so he
</p>
<p>delivered a short speech. That captured them, and they pronounced him
</p>
<p>a good man. They asked him to call again at their next meeting, and he
</p>
<p>promised that he would be on hand. He then reported to me. I told him
</p>
<p>to find a weak spot around the building, where I could put some one to-
</p>
<p>A NOVEL TELEPHONE. 211
</p>
<p>protect him in case of discovery and danger. A few days after he reported
</p>
<p>again that there was a vacant basement under the house, and that it was
</p>
<p>very low. There was only a common door with an ordinary lock. I
</p>
<p>then promised him that I would put a strong man in there at every meeting,
</p>
<p>and in case he should be attacked by the gang, he should shout, "Police."
</p>
<p>Then, the moment the door was broken in, he was to cry out, " Brother ! "
</p>
<p>so that the man coming to his assistance would know him at once. I also
</p>
<p>told him that at the next meeting he should ascertain the size of the room
</p>
<p>and notice whatever furniture might be there and where it was standing.
</p>
<p>This he did. He made a small diagram. I then detailed a man to take a
</p>
<p>position in the basement at several meetings, but, running short of men shortly
</p>
<p>afterwards, I was obliged
</p>
<p>to take this man away.
</p>
<p>But this did not cripple
</p>
<p>us. On another occasion
</p>
<p>the private reported
</p>
<p>again, handed me a plat
</p>
<p>of the room and gave me
</p>
<p>some desired information..
</p>
<p>I sent for Officer Schuet-
</p>
<p>tler. He responded!
</p>
<p>promptly, and I told him
</p>
<p>what I wanted done. He
</p>
<p>said that he was ready
</p>
<p>to carry out my instruc-
</p>
<p>tions. I told him to go
</p>
<p>and buy a one-inch auger,
</p>
<p>and next procure a fun-
</p>
<p>nel with the large end the
</p>
<p>UNDERGROUND AUDITORS. circumference of a saucer,
</p>
<p>and a pipe about four inches long. After an hour's absence he returned with
</p>
<p>the desired articles. I handed him several keys with which to open the
</p>
<p>door, showed him the plat, and told him where to bore a hole. I also told
</p>
<p>him to secure a cork and plug up the hole after he was through. I then

</p>
<p>instructed him to get into the place about half an hour before the meeting
</p>
<p>opened and have his apparatus in working order. I gave Officer Schuet-
</p>
<p>tler the dates on which meetings were to be held, and then he started
</p>
<p>out with good hope in his new undertaking. A few days subsequently
</p>
<p>the officer reported back, and his face was wreathed in smiles.
</p>
<p>"You must have had success," I said.
</p>
<p>" Yes, everything worked like a charm."
</p>
<p>He handed me a good report and remarked that it contained the most
</p>
<p>important part of the business done by the meeting. He suggested that
</p>
<p>2i2 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>he ought to have some one with him so that he could secure all the details.
</p>
<p>For the next meeting I sent another officer with him, and this man had a
</p>
<p>dark lantern. Schuettler would listen, and as he whispered the words and
</p>
<p>sentiments of the speakers, the other officer, with the aid of the light from
</p>
<p>his lantern, would commit them to paper. The next morning I received a
</p>
<p>full report of all the transactions.
</p>
<p>This sort of work was kept up for several months, and during all this
</p>
<p>time I was kept pretty well informed of the secret movements of the old
</p>
<p>North Side groups. At the beginning of all their meetings the speakers
</p>
<p>would declare their wish to see Judge Gary, Mr. Grinnell, all the officers work-
</p>
<p>ing on the case and myself hung. They generally closed with a promise to
</p>
<p>kill all capitalists and blow up all the newspaper buildings.
</p>
<p>One private detective, whom I had at work for me for a long time,
</p>
<p>proved very valuable. He belonged to a union and showed very fine
</p>
<p>judgment. He would watch only the most radical leaders and ascertain
</p>
<p>their intentions. He was a rabid Anarchist himself, but he did not believe
</p>
<p>in killing people or precipitating riots so long as it would not help their
</p>
<p>cause. He often used to say to me :
</p>
<p>"Captain, I will be true to you. I will help you all I can to prevent
</p>
<p>some of these fools from committing any more murders."
</p>
<p>He said that some of his people had not sense enough to know what
</p>
<p>they were doing, and that, whenever he met a man of family who talked
</p>
<p>about killing somebody, he would remonstrate with him. For this good
</p>
<p>and sensible advice some of the reds called him a coward and a spy. At
</p>
<p>one time, on Lake Street, a big, burly brute called him a coward and a
</p>
<p>creeping thing. My man stepped up to the fellow and said :
</p>
<p>"I will make you eat your own words, or you will have to kill me."
</p>
<p>"What do you want me to do ? " asked the big ruffian.
</p>
<p>"Fight a duel," retorted the detective. "I will give you twenty min-
</p>
<p>utes' time in which to secure a revolver and get ready. I will pay your
</p>
<p>car-fare, and we will go out to Garfield Park. No one shall go with us, and
</p>
<p>if you don't accept my challenge, I will kill you anyhow."
</p>
<p>"Are you in earnest ? " asked the other.
</p>
<p>" Never more so in my life," was the reply.

</p>
<p>The boasting coward then begged for more time, which was not granted,
</p>
<p>and, seeing the challenger determined, he winced.
</p>
<p>"I believe you are a good man. I am sorry that I have insulted you,
</p>
<p>and I beg your pardon. Let up on this. If you don't feel like doing so,
</p>
<p>for God's sake do it for my wife and family."
</p>
<p>The young fellow then struck the braggart in the face and walked away.
</p>
<p>The whimpering coward never raised his hand nor uttered another word.
</p>
<p>This man whom I had employed did not like Spies. He termed Spies
</p>
<p>a rattle-head, and disapproved of his arguments in the Fackel that the ist

</p>
<p>of May was the time for the Anarchists to rise. In this view all the more
</p>
<p>sensible conspirators agreed. They knew that they could not accomplish
</p>
<p>anything, and therefore they kept away. My man was one of this latter
</p>
<p>class. He said everything was working nicely in their favor, but Spies
</p>
<p>killed everything. He told me that one night he was in company with
</p>
<p>Spies, and that Spies said :
</p>
<p>" I do not care how little I can accomplish. I want revenge on the
</p>
<p>police. They killed my brother a d d policeman killed him at a pic-
</p>
<p>nic. He shot him dead, and I will never stop until I have more than
</p>
<p>double revenge."
</p>
<p>This statement of Spies' about the killing was true. The brother killed
</p>
<p>was a young tough, and had been shot by Officer Tamillo.
</p>
<p>My man said that from the moment of this interview he had no more
</p>
<p>use for Spies. This detective ceased work for a few months, but he there-
</p>
<p>after resumed his secret service, as he found that, in view of the strikes and
</p>
<p>laying-off, he could hardly make a living otherwise. I put him to work
</p>
<p>again, and he did well, continuing for two months. One day he came to me
</p>
<p>and wanted $30. I gave it to him, and he started away. He would report
</p>
<p>to me daily through the mail, and whenever he had anything -of special
</p>
<p>importance to communicate he always knew just where to find me. I
</p>
<p>missed his reports for five days, and I failed to learn anything of him dur-
</p>
<p>ing that time. On the 2nd of August I was severely injured by being thrown
</p>
<p>out of my buggy, and I was obliged to keep to the house for two weeks.
</p>
<p>On the 5th of August I received a communication from the Coroner of
</p>
<p>Lake County, Indiana, asking me if I had a man named Charles Brown
</p>
<p>working for me as a detective. The letter was as follows :
</p>
<p>HAMMOND, LAKE COUNTY, Indiana, August 3, 1887.
</p>
<p>Captain Schaack Sir : I enclose a copy of a statement of a witness who identified the
</p>
<p>bodies of two parties drowned in Cedar Lake ; also the badge pin found on the man. A Mr.
</p>
<p>Heise stated to me before he saw the body that the man was a detective and wore his police
</p>
<p>badge on his breast. The body had been found by a hard case by the name of Green and
</p>
<p>some pals of his, on the southeast corner of Cedar Lake. When the body was landed, all
</p>
<p>the garments on it were undershirt, drawers and pants. All the rest had disappeared. His
</p>
<p>coat was found later, but nothing in the pockets. The rest was not found. Mr. Heise said

</p>
<p>that he had some money, a watch and chain and a revolver when he left Chicago. Other
</p>
<p>parties say that the man Green changed a $20 note for him some time before he was drowned.
</p>
<p>There are some very mysterious circumstances with regard to his condition as found and
</p>
<p>reported by Green and Scotty, when they found the body, with regard to vest, watch, money
</p>
<p>and revolver. I think a little detective work might show up the matter.
</p>
<p>Respectfully yours, G. VAN DE WALKER,
</p>
<p>Coroner, Lake Co. , Indiana.
</p>
<p>Three days after, I learned that this was the same man I had employed,
</p>
<p>and I placed Officer Schuej:tler on the case to unravel, if possible, the mys-
</p>
<p>tery surrounding his death. The officer in a few days reported that it was
</p>
<p>exceedingly difficult to obtain a clue, as no one seemed disposed to give
</p>
<p>214
</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>any information as to foul play; but enough was learned in a general way to
</p>
<p>warrant the conclusion that underhanded methods had been used to accom-
</p>
<p>plish the man's death.
</p>
<p>I recalled certain incidents in connection wfth the man's work as a
</p>
<p>detective, and, placing them by the side of the seemingly accidental drown-
</p>
<p>ing, I became convinced that a deliber-
</p>
<p>ate crime had been committed.
</p>
<p>One day this private asked me if I
</p>
<p>would allow him to tell a young lady
</p>
<p>what he was working at. I told him that
</p>
<p>he must do nothing of the kind ; that if
</p>
<p>he did so I would have no further use for him. He then begged me to
</p>
<p>permit him to use my name as his friend, and I told him I had no objec-
</p>
<p>tion to that. But I found out later that he had said more to the young lady
</p>
<p>than I had consented to, and J believe his indiscretion in that respect is
</p>
<p>what cost him his life.
</p>
<p>From the moment that the girl ascertained his secret occupation he was a
</p>
<p>doomed man. She let other Anarchists into the secret, and they at once set
</p>
<p>about devising means for ending his life.
</p>
<p>The information I received later was that it had been decided upon that
</p>
<p>the young woman should inveigle him to Cedar Lake, and then, when he
</p>
<p>was in her power, to do away with him. The two left the city together, and
</p>
<p>were followed by the others in the conspiracy to the place where his body was
</p>
<p>found. Before taking the trip on the water, she was seen talking with some
</p>
<p>mysterious-looking individuals, and they then and there decided upon the
</p>
<p>details of the plan. She was to get him to row out into deep water, and,

</p>
<p>v/hen they had got fairly started, her friends were to follow in another row-
</p>
<p>A DESPERATE PLOT. 215
</p>
<p>boat at a convenient distance. When they reached the middle of the lake
</p>
<p>she was to keep a close watch on the other boat, and as they neared her
</p>
<p>boat she was to suddenly throw herself on one side and tip the boat over so
</p>
<p>that both occupants would be thrown into the water. Her friends were then to
</p>
<p>be close at hand, pick her up and save her from drowning. The programme
</p>
<p>was carried out so far as related to the capsizing of the boat, but the men
</p>
<p>did not get near enough in time to save her. She went down with her com-
</p>
<p>panion and was drowned with him.
</p>
<p>There is no doubt as to the truth of this plot. It was in entire keeping
</p>
<p>with Anarchistic methods ; and parties who were at the lake at the time state
</p>
<p>that they saw the young lady get up in the boat, and that while thus stand-
</p>
<p>ing she swung it over, precipitating herself and her lover into the water.
</p>
<p>I had men engaged on the case for some time, but the investigation always
</p>
<p>ended in the same way an undoubted conclusion that the detective's life
</p>
<p>was taken by reason of a plot, but no evidence to establish the guilt of the
</p>
<p>conspirators. From the information I received, I am satisfied that the
</p>
<p>whole matter was carefully planned and carried out by the woman.
</p>
<p>From May 7, 1886, to November 20, 1887, I had a great deal of work,
</p>
<p>there were so many things to look after, but after matters had become
</p>
<p>systematized and the force had been brought down to good working order,
</p>
<p>the burdens of the office became much easier than most people would sup-
</p>
<p>pose.
</p>
<p>In the first place, I had one hundred and sixty rank Anarchists to look
</p>
<p>after ; but as soon as these became known to my men, it was an easy matter
</p>
<p>for the officers to report where they had seen them and with whom they
</p>
<p>associated. Then I had ten small halls to watch where the Anarchists
</p>
<p>met night and day. There were also seventeen saloons where these people
</p>
<p>were accustomed to congregate. Three of these latter had small halls con-
</p>
<p>nected with them. Twelve of the other saloons had rear rooms where the
</p>
<p>reds would sit at times and hold small meetings. After we had all their
</p>
<p>haunts located, and knowing the kind of men who frequented them, the
</p>
<p>work of keeping track of them was not so hard. Some of these Anarchists
</p>
<p>would enter boldly into these places, while others would almost crawl on
</p>
<p>their stomachs to get into the resorts without being seen. Others again

</p>
<p>would disguise themselves so that their identity could not become known
</p>
<p>to detectives.
</p>
<p>The officers made no attempt to close these places, and possibly the
</p>
<p>reader may ask why such notorious and dangerous resorts were permitted
</p>
<p>to continue unmolested.
</p>
<p>My reason for not closing them was that the Anarchists were bound to
</p>
<p>meet in some place. We knew their resorts thoroughly, and I had plenty
</p>
<p>of my men among them, who worked ostensibly for the cause of Anarchy,
</p>
<p>but who continually furnished me pointers. Again, we knew just where
</p>
<p>216 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>they would meet and could always have our men present. If I had shut
</p>
<p>them out from these places, they would have been driven into private
</p>
<p>houses, broken up into smaller factions, and our work would have been
</p>
<p>made much broader and harder in keeping track of them and their doings.
</p>
<p>So long as I had the machine, so to speak, in my own hands, and knew all
</p>
<p>that had been done and said, we let them alone. And the results justified
</p>
<p>our course.
</p>
<p>Among the saloon-keepers there was one who seemed to have a special
</p>
<p>liking for me. This man, who had a place on Lake Street, on taking his
</p>
<p>first drink in the morning would invariably drink to my health, saying : " I
</p>
<p>hope that that d d Luxemburger, Schaack, will be killed before I go to
</p>
<p>bed to-night ;" and when he was about to close his doggery for the day, he
</p>
<p>would take two drinks and say : "I hope I will find Schaack hanging to a
</p>
<p>lamp-post in the morning when I get up."
</p>
<p>When the saloon-keepers were particularly loaded with beer, they
</p>
<p>shouted louder than any one else for Anarchy, and the louder and more
</p>
<p>vehemently they shouted the more "solid "did they become with their
</p>
<p>Anarchist customers. At every meeting held at these places, collections
</p>
<p>were taken up, and the saloon-keepers could always be counted upon to
</p>
<p>contribute liberally.
</p>
<p>The worst of these ignorant fools never did realize why the saloon-
</p>
<p>keepers shouted so lustily for Anarchy until they came home to find their
</p>
<p>wives and little ones crying for bread. Then, perhaps, it faintly dawned
</p>
<p>upon their minds that the saloon-keepers were after their nickels. These
</p>
<p>liquor-sellers were Anarchists for revenue only, and they sought in every way
</p>
<p>to keep on the right side of the rank and file of the party. They always
</p>
<p>looked to it, the first thing in the morning, that plenty of Anarchist litera-
</p>
<p>ture and a dozen or so copies of the Arbeiter-Zeitung were duly on the tables
</p>
<p>of their places, and in some saloons beer-bloated bums, who could manage
</p>
<p>to read fairly, were engaged to read aloud such articles as were particularly
</p>
<p>calculated to stir up the passions of the benighted patrons. Robber
</p>
<p>and hypocrite are terms too weak to apply to these saloon-keepers. Some
</p>
<p>of them had "walking delegates" by their side, and if an Anarchist
</p>
<p>seemed to them to be "going wrong" by seeking work, the delegate and

<p>assistant robber would tell him to go back to his headquarters and
</p>
<p>wait, assuring him that they would have all things right in a few
</p>
<p>days.
</p>
<p>And this is the way these poor fools and their families were kept in
</p>
<p>continual misery. Many of the dupes have had their eyes opened and
</p>
<p>have quit frequenting these places and the underground caves. What is
</p>
<p>the result ? Their families are better looked after, and the difference in
</p>
<p>their comfort is very apparent. They used to call the Chicago Avenue
</p>
<p>Station "Schaack's Bastile," but let me say that those saloon-keepers with
</p>
<p>MODERN BASTILE-KEEPERS. 217
</p>
<p>their low and contemptible resorts were the real bastile-keepers. Hundreds
</p>
<p>and hundreds of men, heads and fathers of families, have been kept in
</p>
<p>squalid want by spending their very last cent in these holes, and their
</p>
<p>dependents have been left without food, proper clothing or fuel. I believe in
</p>
<p>unions for proper objects, but even these should not be continued for the
</p>
<p>benefit of such saloon-keepers.
</p>
<p>All these men were great heroes so long as they could hope to enrich
</p>
<p>themselves, but when the chief conspirators were locked up in jail, and
</p>
<p>liberal contributions were demanded for the defense, their enthusiasm in
</p>
<p>the holy cause of Anarchy was considerably cooled.
</p>
<p>While Chicago is regarded as the head center of Anarchy in America,
</p>
<p>people of other cities and States should not imagine that the vicious reds
</p>
<p>are all in this city. There are plenty of them scattered throughout the
</p>
<p>country, and this fact was made quite manifest at the time the Anarchists
</p>
<p>were being arrested. Friends of the imprisoned men came to Chicago from
</p>
<p>all over the United States, and financial assistance poured in on all sides.
</p>
<p>Those who came here were open in their declarations of sympathy and
</p>
<p>never attempted to conceal their actions.
</p>
<p>When these same men were at their homes they did not dare to openly
</p>
<p>say a word in favor of Anarchy, because they were few in numbers ; but
</p>
<p>should there be enough to make a formidable showing, they will throw off
</p>
<p>their mask and assume a defiant, menacing attitude.
</p>
<p>These arrivals, just as soon as they became known, were kept under
</p>
<p>espionage, and every movement they made was looked after, lest they might
</p>
<p>commit some desperate deed. Of course there were a great many whom
</p>
<p>the police did not discover, and it is a wonder that, during the excitement
</p>
<p>incident to the arrest of so many Anarchists and the searches made of
</p>
<p>Anarchistic houses, some diabolical act was not perpetrated. Possibly
</p>
<p>they discovered that the omnipresent police were so thoroughly on the
</p>
<p>inside of their conspiracy that detection was inevitable. It is certain that
</p>
<p>they knew that I had become thoroughly posted as to the inside workings
</p>
<p>of Anarchy, and the sound fear which I was able to inspire by a bold and
</p>
<p>aggressive policy no doubt acted as a restraint upon any violent outburst
</p>
<p>of passion and revenge.

</p>
<p>It was constant vigilance alone that averted trouble, and no Anarchist
</p>
<p>of a specially vicious disposition was permitted to feel that his movements
</p>
<p>were overlooked or unwatched. For this purpose I had Anarchists among
</p>
<p>Anarchists to inform on Anarchists, and all the meetings were thus kept
</p>
<p>under strict surveillance. Even private houses were watched. On one
</p>
<p>occasion I desired to secure certain information. One of the private detec-
</p>
<p>tives was accordingly detailed to watch the rear of a certain building from
</p>
<p>an alley. He was there for two days without being observed by any one,
</p>
<p>but on the third day he was noticed by a police officer. The officer asked
</p>
<p>him what he was doing in that locality, and the private responded :
</p>
<p>218
</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>" I am waiting for a friend of mine who is working in this barn, and I
</p>
<p>expect him around soon."
</p>
<p>The officer placed no reliance on the statement, and so he hustled him
</p>
<p>out of the alley. The detective walked on a short distance, and, as soon as
</p>
<p>the officer was out of sight, retraced his steps and returned to the place,
</p>
<p>this time finding a different point for his observations. He had scarcely
</p>
<p>thought himself secure from further interruptions, when the back gate
</p>
<p>of the next yard opened, and in walked the same officer. Both were alike
</p>
<p>surprised. But this
</p>
<p>time there were no
</p>
<p>questions asked and
</p>
<p>no explanations de-
</p>
<p>manded. The officer
</p>
<p>promptly seized the
</p>

<p>From a Photograph.
</p>
<p>I then returned and told him that, when brought into court, he should
</p>
<p>not say anything to the judge, but play the part of a fool and simpleton.
</p>
<p>His case came up ; he was fined $5 and sent back to the lock-up. I went
</p>
<p>to him later, handed him the money, and in half an hour he paid his fine
</p>
<p>and left. The detective went back to his post, but the officer was not put
</p>
<p>on that beat again. My man worked for about two weeks and finished
</p>
<p>his job.
</p>
<p>Of course, the detectives in the case had varied experiences. On another
</p>
<p>occasion it was desirable to know what was being done at some secret
</p>
<p>meetings held at Thalia Hall, No. 703 Milwaukee Avenue. This v/as after
</p>
<p>OFFICER NORDRUM' S WORK. 219
</p>
<p>the trial of the Anarchists had begun. I assigned a few detectives in that
</p>
<p>direction, and shortly afterwards the proceedings might as well have been
</p>
<p>open so far as the police were concerned.
</p>
<p>My boys had a great deal of fun. They managed to discover a way by
</p>
<p>which they secured an entrance under the stage, and at the first meeting
</p>
<p>they attended they amused themselves by cutting a hole through that por-
</p>
<p>tion of the stage facing the audience. When they had done this, they could
</p>
<p>see all present and hear everything that was said. Many a night they held
</p>
<p>to that port-hole and enjoyed the circus on the outside. They heard many
</p>
<p>a speech of a threatening character against Judge Gary, Mr. Grinnell, Mr.
</p>
<p>Bonfield and myself, and sometimes they had to listen to some rampant
</p>
<p>speaker who would depict the pleasure all Anarchists would enjoy at seeing
</p>
<p>the funerals of these officials passing through the streets. Of course, those
</p>
<p>who were the most bitter had the least courage, and so long as the auditors
</p>
<p>only listened to speeches, my boys were perfectly satisfied that no immedi-
</p>
<p>ate danger was to be apprehended.
</p>
<p>I finally learned that some of the Anarchists had become suspicious,
</p>
<p>and therefore ordered Officer Schuettler and the others to remain away, as
</p>
<p>they would otherwise be discovered. And they would have been. One
</p>
<p>day the Anarchists made a careful search of the building, and they found the
</p>
<p>hole through which the boys had peeped. They then decided on a plan. It
</p>
<p>was that during the next meeting, which they felt certain some of my boys
</p>
<p>would attend, a great commotion should be made in the hall. This would
</p>
<p>surely bring one of the detectives with his eye very near the hole. Then
</p>
<p>one of the Anarchists should stealthily creep up on the side, suddenly
</p>
<p>plunge a sharp iron through the hole, and kill the man within.
</p>
<p>One officer, who proved of great assistance to me, was Charles Nordrum.
</p>
<p>He became engaged in the case shortly after the Haymarket riot, and after
</p>
<p>a time became a regular attach^ of the detective department. He was
</p>
<p>born in Norway on the gth of November, 1858, and had lived in Chicago
</p>
<p>since 1868. He joined the police force in November, 1884, and, possessing
</p>
<p>a great deal of tact and shrewdness, his services were soon enlisted in the
</p>
<p>work of hunting up the red conspirators. He worked at times with Officer
</p>
<p>Schuettler, but reported to Ebersold. Both were known to my officers, but

</p>
<p>they did not know of my private workers. Nordrum was especially detailed
</p>
<p>to look after some meetings at Thalia Hall, at the Emma Street Hall, in
</p>
<p>the rear room of Zepf's saloon, in the rear room of Greif's saloon, at No.
</p>
<p>600 Blue Island Avenue, and at the Northwestern Hall, and he did not
</p>
<p>overlook meetings held in the cellars of some of the more prominent Anar-
</p>
<p>chists on the Northwest Side and of others who were in sympathy with the
</p>
<p>Anarchists. He wormed himself into the good graces of quite a number of
</p>
<p>the reds, and was always kindly received by them. After a time the police
</p>
<p>stopped the holding of meetings in some of the halls, and then the Anar-
</p>

</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>chist sympathizers harbored the reds in their cellars, furnishing candles for
</p>
<p>illumination and nail-kegs for seats. On the 5th of July, 1887, Nordrum
</p>
<p>was exposed at No. 599 Milwaukee Avenue, and he was at once surrounded
</p>
<p>by an infuriated mob. The Anarchists with whom he had associated
</p>
<p>attempted to kill him, but the officer, after a desperate fight, succeeded in
</p>
<p>reaching the door before any serious violence had been done him. This, of
</p>
<p>course, destroyed his further usefulness among them, but out of his knowl-
</p>
<p>edge of the men and their affairs two arrests were effected. He and Officer
</p>
<p>Schuettler brought in Emil Wende and Frederick Kost, members of the
</p>
<p>UNDERGROUND CONSPIRATORS.
</p>
<p>Terra Cotta Union. These men had been selected to buy each member of
</p>
<p>their group a 42-caliber revolver and one box of cartridges, and the weapons
</p>
<p>so secured were to have been used on the police on the day of the execu-
</p>
<p>tion. The weapons had been purchased, and as soon as the principals had
</p>
<p>been placed under arrest, a descent was made upon the supply. All the
</p>
<p>revolvers were captured and brought to the Central Station.
</p>
<p>Noticing how successfully they had been circumvented in all their move-
</p>
<p>ments, the Anarchists naturally came to the conclusion that detectives were
</p>
<p>working in their ranks either in the interest of myself or of Billy Pinker-

<p>ton, and they resolved to discover, if possible, the men so engaged. One
</p>
<p>UNSUCCESSFUL SPIES.
</p>
<p>221
</p>
<p>day a very intelligent fellow called at my office and wanted to know if I
</p>
<p>desired any more men to work for me among the Anarchists. He stated
</p>
<p>that he was well acquainted with all the reds, and, if I would pay him well,
</p>
<p>he would render good service.
</p>
<p>I called him into my private office, and I closely questioned him. I
</p>
<p>learned that he knew a great many of them, and I told him that I wanted
</p>
<p>one good man. He then considered himself engaged, and said to me :
</p>
<p>"Now you had better tell me all the men that are working for you
</p>
<p>and show them all to me so we can work together."
</p>
<p>I told him that if he could find out any one of my men I would pay
</p>
<p>him $20 a week, and then he might consider himself engaged. He went
</p>
<p>away, but he never came back to claim the $20.
</p>
<p>This ruse having failed; the Anarchists devised another. One day early
</p>
<p>in August, 1886, they sent one of my countrymen, a Luxemburger, to me.
</p>
<p>This fellow began to play his cards very nicely,
</p>
<p>and sought to carve a very pretty little path
</p>
<p>into my confidence, but he had not proceeded
</p>
<p>very far before my suspicions were aroused,
</p>
<p>and he got nothing to satisfy either himself
</p>
<p>or those who sent him. While our conversa-
</p>
<p>tion was going on one of the officers came in,
</p>
<p>and, noticing the fellow, called me into another
</p>
<p>room. The officer then stated that he had seen
</p>
<p>the man hanging around West Lake Street,
</p>
<p>had seen him drunk frequently, and had once
</p>
<p>found him in tears, saying that he had come
</p>
<p>from Paris, had seen the downfall of the
</p>
<p>Commune there, and that now that Anarchy
</p>
<p>was suppressed in Chicago all hope for liberty
</p>
<p>was gone, and he would be ready to die at his
</p>
<p>own hands after he should have first killed somebody,
</p>
<p>the office.
</p>
<p>"See here, old fellow," said I, "I have spies amongst the Anarchists,

</p>
<p>but I do not want spies among my own command."
</p>
<p>The man was then asked if he could do any work, and when he said
</p>
<p>that he had not done any work in a long time, I remarked that I had a job
</p>
<p>for him. He became interested and wanted to know what kind of a job it was.
</p>
<p>"It is under Superintendent Felton at the House of Correction, and he
</p>
<p>will assign you to work that will keep the dogs from biting you for six
</p>
<p>months. You are a vagrant, and I will bring you into court to-morrow
</p>
<p>morning and have you fined $100. That will be six months."
</p>
<p>The man begged piteously to be spared that punishment, and I plied
</p>
<p>him with questions. He stated that, inasmuch as he was of the same
</p>
<p>OFFICER NORDRUM.
</p>
<p>I returned to
</p>
<p>222 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>nationality as myself, the Anarchists thought he could readily get into my
</p>
<p>secrets, and they had forced him to come. I told him that my officers knew
</p>
<p>him and had him spotted, and that unless he left the city by the next day I
</p>
<p>would have him arrested and sent to the work-house. He left the station,
</p>
<p>and I have never seen him since. Since then I have received a letter from
</p>
<p>Michigan, saying that if the writer had me there I would never see Chicago
</p>
<p>again, as he would find work for me for awhile, and I am confident that it
</p>
<p>came from my old friend.
</p>
<p>During the progress of the investigations some curious characters were
</p>
<p>encountered. Some sought me, as I have already noted, but in most
</p>
<p>instances I had to hunt them. One eccentric genius was especially notice-
</p>
<p>able. He had started out with the intention of reading himself into the
</p>
<p>Anarchist faith, and for this purpose be became a constant reader of the
</p>
<p>Arbeiter-Zeitung and its Sunday edition, the Fackel. For some time he
</p>
<p>wavered in his opinion, but the more he read the more he became convinced
</p>
<p>that there was something in Anarchy. At last he became so deeply imbued
</p>
<p>that he almost regarded it a sacrilege to destroy the copies he had pur-
</p>
<p>chased for his enlightenment. He carefully stowed the papers away in the
</p>
<p>closet in his room, and when he returned from work he would open the
</p>
<p>door and examine his collection much as a miser inspects his hoard.
</p>
<p>May 4 finally came, and with it the event he had looked forward to so
</p>
<p>longingly. But the outcome did not suit him. He noticed that the police
</p>
<p>were getting uncomfortably close to his locality, but he did not feel any
</p>
<p>special concern until one evening a patrol wagon pulled up in front of
</p>
<p>No. 105 Wells Street, near his own domicile. He saw the officers
</p>
<p>approaching in the direction of the entrance, and, jumping from his chair
</p>
<p>near the window, shouted to his landlady :
</p>
<p>" For heaven's sake ! the police are coming to search the house what
</p>
<p>will I do ? If they come into my room and find my papers, I will be arrested
</p>
<p>and locked up as an Anarchist. Let me burn my papers in your stove."
</p>
<p>The landlady would not permit it, as she feared arrest as an accomplice.
</p>
<p>The young man almost fell on his knees in pleading with her for permission.
</p>
<p>Finding his appeals useless, he hastened to his room, lit a fire in a sheet-
</p>
<p>iron stove there, and began to burn his whole collection. His haste was so-

</p>
<p>great that he crammed too many papers in at once, and the stove became
</p>
<p>overheated. The wall paper began to burn, and the Anarchist had to give
</p>
<p>his attention to moving the bed and furniture away from the walls. He did
</p>
<p>not dare to give an alarm of fire, and yet he saw that the whole room would
</p>
<p>be in flames in a few moments. He seized a pitcher of water, emptied its
</p>
<p>contents on the wall, opened the door and called for the landlady to come
</p>
<p>to his assistance. She responded, and when she saw the situation, she
</p>
<p>cried out, "Fire, fire ! " He endeavored to make her desist from her cries
</p>
<p>OFFICIAL NEGLIGENCE.
</p>
<p>223
</p>
<p>and urged her to bring him water. Water was brought and soused all over
</p>
<p>the stove and the walls.
</p>
<p>By this time the house was full of smoke, and they opened the window.
</p>
<p>An officer in the wagon noticed the smoke, and shouted to some of his com-
</p>
<p>panions that there was a fire next door up-stairs. The young man over-
</p>
<p>heard this and hastened to tell the officer that it was only smoke and that
</p>
<p>no assistance was required.
</p>
<p>The landlady now ran away to escape possible arrest, and the young man
</p>
<p>was left alone. He again assured the officer below that the smoke had all
</p>
<p>cleared away, and he slammed down the window.
</p>
<p>After thus es-
</p>
<p>caping police in-
</p>
<p>vestigation, the
</p>
<p>youthful Anarchist
</p>
<p>felt happy, and he
</p>
<p>had reasons to be,
</p>
<p>as he would cer-
</p>
<p>tainly have been ar-
</p>
<p>rested, in view of
</p>
<p>his actions, had the
</p>
<p>officers ever en-
</p>
<p>tered his room.
</p>
<p>Others had been
</p>
<p>arrested under less
</p>
<p>suspicious circum-
</p>
<p>stances, and it took
</p>
<p>some of them along
</p>
<p>time to satisfactori-
</p>
<p>ly explain their po-
</p>
<p>sition. The young
</p>
<p>man has since be-

<p>He may deny this in his paper, but I will never "give him away."
</p>
<p>While pursuing the investigations, and never losing hope of finding Par-
</p>
<p>sons, I was one day informed by Officer Henry Fechter that a man who knew
</p>
<p>the foxy Anarchist had seen the fugitive at Geneva, Wis., and his arrest
</p>
<p>might be easily effected. The officer was a detail at the time at the North-
</p>
<p>western Railroad depot, and his informant was a reliable gentleman. I
</p>
<p>instructed the officer to report his information to Chief Ebersold, as I was
</p>
<p>helpless in the matter, having no authority to send an officer* outside of the
</p>
<p>city limits. That was the last I ever heard of it. The information
</p>
<p>was evidently pigeonholed, and Parsons continued to bask in rural sunshine

<p>THE SCARED AMATEUR ANARCHIST.
</p>
<p>224 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>and enjoy himself until the day he came into court of his own free will.
</p>
<p>This was not the only instance of supine neglect in the Chief's office and
</p>
<p>the detective department. I have already spoken of the case of Schnau-
</p>
<p>belt, the bomb-thrower, but there is still another striking illustration. It
</p>
<p>was shortly after the selection of a jury to try the Anarchists. The Bonfield
</p>
<p>brothers and myself were obliged to be in court nearly all the time, and the
</p>
<p>Anarchists on the outside, observing this, began to concoct plots for taking
</p>
<p>revenge on the city. In this emergency the Chief decided to go to California,
</p>
<p>and, in order that he might have cheerful company, he invited Lieut. Joseph
</p>
<p>Kipley, of the so-called detective department, and Capt. William Buckley,
</p>
<p>of the First Precinct.
</p>
<p>When Mr. Grinnell heard of this contemplated trip, at a time when, for
</p>
<p>the sake of public appearance at least, the Chief ought to have remained at
</p>
<p>home, he firmly remonstrated and reminded the official of his duty. But
</p>
<p>Ebersold shook his head.
</p>
<p>"I have got my tickets," said he; "what will I do with them?"
</p>
<p>"Throw them into the lake," replied Mr. Grinnell.
</p>
<p>But the Chief was obstinate, and he and his party left for the Pacific
</p>
<p>Coast. The force was then left in command of Inspector John Bonfield,
</p>
<p>who thus had double duty imposed upon him.
</p>
<p>The moment the work of impaneling the jury had begun, the outside
</p>
<p>Anarchists began to exert themselves to put some of their own men into
</p>
<p>the jury-box. When they found that the State was too vigilant, however,
</p>
<p>they next set about to secure such witnesses as could be counted upon to
</p>
<p>swear their friends out of jail. Take the evidence of the strongest witnesses
</p>
<p>put on the stand by the defense, and the critical, unbiased examiner will
</p>
<p>readily discover that many of them were simply perjurers.
</p>
<p>But the labors of the reds were in vain, and when they began to realize
</p>
<p>that the jury did not seem impressed with the character of theif evidence,
</p>
<p>the outside barbarians grew desperate and resolved on a new line of tactics.
</p>
<p>One day I received a note from one of my men warning me to protect
</p>
<p>the jury. The Anarchists, he said, were working out a scheme to injure
</p>
<p>some of the jurors, and if they could succeed in that, they were confident
</p>
<p>the case would have to be begun anew. If the case ever came up

</p>
<p>again, no man would care to risk his life in a trial of the conspirators,
</p>
<p>and their brothers would go free. If, however, the State should secure a
</p>
<p>full set of jurors, they would give them a dose of dynamite, and that would
</p>
<p>certainly end the case. Then they could keep on with Anarchy and make
</p>
<p>the capitalists cower before them. This plan, I was informed, had met the
</p>
<p>entire approval of the gang.
</p>
<p>I conferred with Mr. Grinnell, and as a result we doubled the watch to
</p>
<p>protect the jury. We made it a point also to know when the jurors went
</p>
<p>out for a walk or a drive, and, without their knowledge, trustworthy men

</p>
<p>were always with them or near them until their return. The hotel in which
</p>
<p>they were quartered was only about two hundred feet from the Criminal
</p>
<p>Court building, but whenever they came to the court in the morning, or
</p>
<p>went to their meals during recess, or left the court building after each day's
</p>
<p>adjournment, twelve detectives along the line kept vigilant watch of all
</p>
<p>suspicious characters. Besides the detectives there were fifteen officers in
</p>
<p>uniform, and during the last three days of the trial we even redoubled our
</p>
<p>vigilance. There were twenty-five officers on the street, twenty-five more
</p>
<p>in the court-room, and twenty-five men about the building. All these men

<p>were in uniform, so that the "cranks" could see them, and it proved to be a
</p>
<p>very good precaution. During the night, detectives and regular patrol-
</p>
<p>men were watching inside and outside at the jurors' hotel.
</p>
<p>On the last day of the arguments, when Mr. Grinnell was closing for the
</p>
<p>State, something very suspicious was noticed in the court-room. A man
</p>
<p>with a very mysterious air had been seen around the building for eight
</p>
<p>days preceding, and it was recalled that he came at varying hours of the
</p>
<p>day. On each occasion he held a few moments' private talk with some of

</p>
<p>those Anarchists who had displayed interest in the proceedings, after which
</p>
<p>226 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS
</p>
<p>he always disappeared. The parties he generally talked with were Belz,
</p>
<p>who assisted in conducting the defense, Mrs. Parsons and Mrs. Holmes.
</p>
<p>He was about five feet ten inches tall, about forty years of age, weighed
</p>
<p>about 1 80 pounds, had a round face, short, stubby, sandy beard and mus-
</p>
<p>tache, a nose built on the feminine plan, large, gray, piercing eyes, and
</p>
<p>withal he was not a very prepossessing man.
</p>
<p>During the last hour, when Mr. Grinnell was making his plea to the
</p>
<p>jury, this man entered the court-room and took a seat in the front, right in
</p>
<p>the midst of the Anarchists' families. This brought him within seven or
</p>
<p>eight feet behind the State's Attorney. He crossed his arms over his
</p>
<p>stomach, and leaned pretty well forward, keeping his hands concealed under
</p>
<p>his coat. I was surprised at the fellow's impudence, because the court-
</p>
<p>room at the time was so still that a whisper could have been distinctly
</p>
<p>heard all over the room. I sat at a table, with Mr. Walker to the left and
</p>
<p>Mr. Ingham to the right, and I called the attention of these two gentlemen
</p>
<p>to the mysterious man and his queer attitude. They watched his nervous
</p>
<p>actions, and became alarmed lest he might be there for some vicious object.
</p>
<p>The man had indeed a desperate look, but it was thought best not to inter-
</p>
<p>rupt the proceedings just then. Under the strict orders of Judge Gary,
</p>
<p>everybody was obliged to be seated in the court-room, and when the seats
</p>
<p>were full no more were admitted. This was another good precaution at such
</p>
<p>a trial. The police officials had thus a clear view of the whole room.
</p>
<p>At times, whenever there happened to be some severe allusions to the
</p>
<p>defendants by Mr. Grinnell, the stranger would twist himself around
</p>
<p>uneasily, all the time, however, maintaining his peculiar attitude. Mr.
</p>
<p>Ingham remarked that he was afraid the stranger might suddenly jump on
</p>
<p>Mr. Grinnell and stab him in the back. Mr. Walker expressed a similar
</p>
<p>opinion. I said that he should get no chance to do that, as I would kill
</p>
<p>him before he could take one step toward Mr. Grinnell, and at the same
</p>
<p>time I got my trusty 38-caliber Colt's revolver in position where I could
</p>
<p>produce it the instant it was needed. We all agreed that this would be
</p>
<p>the right course to take. At one time the man looked sharply at me, and
</p>
<p>I gave him a savage look right into his eyes. From that time I kept him
</p>
<p>busy looking at me.

</p>
<p>As soon as Mr. Grinnell had concluded the man jumped up, drew near
</p>
<p>to Belz and spoke to him. Then he turned to a woman and handed her a
</p>
<p>paper. Meanwhile I had already called a detective to watch him, and as
</p>
<p>soon as the stranger reached the corridor he was searched. Nothing dan-
</p>
<p>gerous was found about his person, but it was impossible to learn where
</p>
<p>he lived or what was his name. He would give no account of himself, and
</p>
<p>he was taken down stairs and kept there until all the detectives had taken
</p>
<p>a good look at him. He was then told to go and never show himself around
</p>
<p>the building again.
</p>
<p>DAMAGING DOCUMENTS. 227
</p>
<p>On the next morning a revolver was found in the building, and the opin-
</p>
<p>ion among those posted on the affair was that it must have belonged to the
</p>
<p>mysterious visitor. He had evidently come with a desperate determination
</p>
<p>to shoot some one, even at the sacrifice of his own life, but, seeing how slim
</p>
<p>were his chances for getting near his victim after the close watch kept upon
</p>
<p>him, he abandoned his intention and dropped his revolver to destroy any
</p>
<p>evidence against himself.
</p>
<p>Possibly he may have been simply engaged in playing a "bluff " on his
</p>
<p>Anarchist friends, his intention being to make them believe that he had
</p>
<p>nerve enough to go right into a court-room and shoot down an official, and
</p>
<p>afterwards to excuse his failure by referring to his friends for proof that he
</p>
<p>was so closely watched that he had no opportunity to get near his victim.
</p>
<p>Mr. Grinnell was shortly afterwards informed of the incident, and he
</p>
<p>remarked that possibly a "crank" might have been found by the Anarchists
</p>
<p>to make an assault that they themselves had not, the courage to undertake.
</p>
<p>As I have already indicated, a great many documents and letters, public
</p>
<p>and private, fell into the hands of the police during the searches made,
</p>
<p>and from the collection I give a few for the purpose of showing what kind
</p>
<p>of a dynamite office was being run by Parsons and Spies.
</p>
<p>The following was found by Detective James Bonfield on Parsons' desk
</p>
<p>in the Alarm office, May 5, 1886 :
</p>
<p>Dealers in Marble and Granite Cemetery Work. No. 193 Woodland Avenue, CLEVELAND,
</p>
<p>OHIO, April 29, 1886.
</p>
<p>Comrade Parsons : Providing we send you the following dispatch: "Another bouncing
</p>
<p>boy, weight n pounds, all are well signal Fred Smith," can you send us No. i for the
</p>
<p>amount we sent you by telegram. Please give us your lowest estimate. Also state by what
</p>
<p>express company you will send it to us.
</p>
<p>Parsons had nothing to do with either handling or selling dynamite, if
</p>
<p>his own statements are to be accepted. Still he and Spies and their crowd
</p>
<p>seem to have had a great many inquiries for the " good stuff " Parsons
</p>
<p>used to refer to in his speeches, and which he urged his followers to carry
</p>
<p>in their vest pockets during the day and keep under their pillows at
</p>
<p>night. Another evidence of their guilt was found on the same day by
</p>
<p>Detective Bonfield in the Arbeiter-Zeitung office, on Spies' desk :

<p>In justice to the company it should be explained that they had no

<p>I have already referred to the great courtesy shown Schnaubelt at the

<p>Central Station how, when he was brought by Officer Palmer for the third

<p>228 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>time before Lieut. Shea and the Chief, he was promptly ordered released,,
</p>
<p>and how he finally and hastily concluded to leave the city in order to save-
</p>
<p>the detective department any further trouble on his account. It subse-
</p>
<p>quently transpired that the direction he took was for the great and bound-
</p>
<p>less West; but in all his wanderings he always seems to have kindly
</p>
<p>remembered his friends in Chicago for permitting him to take so extended
</p>
<p>a journey. He even wrote back to some of them, and one letter, whicli
</p>
<p>was put in the possession of Officer Palmer, is especially worthy of pub-
</p>
<p>licity. It reads as follows :
</p>
<p>PORTLAND, .OREGON.
</p>
<p>To the Chief .of Police, Chicago My Dear Old Jackass: Thanks to your pig-headed,
</p>
<p>lieutenant, I am here sound and safe. Before this reaches you I have left here, and the only
</p>
<p>thing I regret is that we did not kill more of your blue-coated hounds. SCHNAUBELT.
</p>
<p>The following, received by Parsons and Spies, are self-explanatory :
</p>
<p>EUFAULA, April 13, 1886
</p>
<p>Dear Comrade Parsons : I have received your papers and am very much obliged for
</p>
<p>them. Glad that you like my article. I am writing now for To-Day, of London, and for
</p>
<p>the Alarm, and am going to write for La Tribune du Peuple de Paris. Situated as I am now,
</p>
<p>I can be of no good but by writing, and I intend to avail myself of it. You may be aston-
</p>
<p>ished if I tell you that I never use the word "Anarchy." I stick to the old word " Social-
</p>
<p>ism." It can be understood and does not require any knowledge of Greek to make out its
</p>
<p>meaning. If I was to seek in the Greek language for a word to express where I stand, I
</p>
<p>would call myself an Anticrat, opposed to any kind of crazy notions, democracy as well as
</p>
<p>aristocracy. I am for individual responsibility and social action. I am for liberty, but
</p>
<p>within society, not above it, and, first of all, I am for equality of conditions. I want organi-
</p>
<p>zation first, revolution second, social economy re-organization third, and abolition of
</p>
<p>governmental action last of all. If you could confiscate the government to-morrow, I would
</p>
<p>have no objection to use it for a while.
</p>
<p>Anarchism has a very dangerous drift toward individualism, as you may perceive by
</p>
<p>reading Liberty, of Boston, and individualism is bound to generate some kind of a crazy
</p>
<p>notion and end in despotism. Beware of individualistic Anarchism and stick to the socialistic.
</p>
<p>We are in a state of warfare with all the crazes and must use all the weapons of warfare
</p>
<p>within our reach. Our present weapons strikes and boycotting are dangerous, and',
</p>
<p>expulsive if we were to use the ballot. The workers are the many ; the masters the few.

<p>WHAT CHEER, KEOKUK COUNTY, IOWA, April 18, 1886.
</p>
<p>A. R. Parsons, Esq. Dear Sir : We organized a group of the Lehr und Wehr Verein
</p>
<p>in this town on the above date. The organizer was your comrade John McGinn, of Rock
</p>
<p>Spring, Wyoming. Inclosed you will find the amount for the cards names as follows :
</p>
<p>John H. Nicholson, miner ; age, ... 41 Benjamin E. Williams, miner ; age, . . 37
</p>
<p>Arthur Cowrey, " " ... 42 William Jackson, " " . 39

</p>
<p>Isaac Little, " " ... 39 William H. Osborne, " " . . 36-
</p>
<p>John R. Thomas, miner ; age -33
</p>
<p>INTERESTING CORRESPONDENCE. 229
</p>
<p>I suppose you will need to know who is chief and secretary of the group. John McGinn
</p>
<p>is chief and John H. Nicholson is the secretary. I remain yours, in the care of John H.
</p>
<p>Nicholson, What Cheer, Keokuk County, Iowa, Box 697.
</p>
<p>ST. Louis, March 27, 1886.
</p>
<p>Mrs. and Mr. Parsons: We were quite sorry to learn of your sickness, which prevented
</p>
<p>you to be with us at the Commune Festival, while we were just as glad to see that Mrs. Par-
</p>
<p>sons did accept our invitation. My hope and wish that you are well again for the present.
</p>
<p>The Commune Festival was well attended by a large crowd, and it was a great disappoint-
</p>
<p>ment for the J. W. P. A. being forced to announce the absence of the English speaker. I
</p>
<p>am quite aware that it would have been a great lift for our principles if Mrs. Parsons could
</p>
<p>have been present. However, St. Louis is not Chicago, and the movement is not as well
</p>
<p>progressing as in Chicago. No wonder. I have been teached lately a lesson myself, and
</p>
<p>therefore withdraw as a member of the group. We herewith send you a little collection of
</p>
<p>picture cards, which Mary had saved up for your children. We intended to send them
</p>
<p>along with Mrs. Parsons. Mary has already two large scrap-books full of such collections.
</p>
<p>Hail for the revolution. Yours respectfully, J. M. MENTYER.
</p>
<p>P. S. If you have any old Alarms to spare, I would make good use of them at present
</p>
<p>during this railroad strike. I shall soon send some money again. I also send you the
</p>
<p>Chronicle so you can see what declaration the Knights of Labor have issued in answer to
</p>
<p>Monster Robber Gould.
</p>
<p>Personal. PORT JARVIS, N. Y., October 31, 1885.
</p>
<p>My Dear Comrade: Well, I will stay here, as I wrote you. I started out on a " tramp "
</p>
<p>to look for a job. I stayed nearly a week at New Haven and spoke there, though why Lib-
</p>
<p>erty should head his letter from there "Unfortunate for Herr Most," is more than I can
</p>
<p>see. I came here and looked up an old friend, John G. Mills. He proposed starting a small
</p>
<p>job book-bindery. He puts in capital and I the skill. That seems fair ; while I will be sure
</p>
<p>of a mere living for the winter, there is no guarantee that capital will gain by it. So the
</p>
<p>timidity of capital must be overcome. Well, the bargain is this : When I pay back the
</p>
<p>advance capital (and until I do so I am not to draw in amount over $5.00 a week), paid it
</p>
<p>all, then I am to own half and we will start equal partners, and he furnishes more capital if
</p>
<p>necessary on half paid back. I have agreed, as I believe it is the best I can do, and it opens
</p>
<p>a good prospect. It is probable that I will not be very active in " the cause " here, as every
</p>
<p>moment will be occupied, but I am willing to go anywhere within reasonable distance this
</p>
<p>winter and give a lecture to any group for mere expenses car-fare and board and be-

</p>
<p>lieve I could stir up the boys. New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York, all three join
</p>
<p>together here, and any of the three States would be convenient. I should give a lecture
</p>
<p>rather than a speech, but it would be extempore. Can't you drop a line to Philadelphia, or
</p>
<p>some point near ? Buffalo is nearly as near.
</p>
<p>When I feel like giving you an article I shall mail it, but, of course, you will use it or lay
</p>
<p>it over as you feel about it. I think I can put a point strongly, but do not want to crowd
</p>
<p>out anything else.
</p>
<p>If you can use me on your paper, draw on me for all the copy you like. I like the Alarm
</p>
<p>and think it has improved since last spring. Any points I can get from French papers, I
</p>
<p>will give you the benefit of. I never got that card. Is it contrary to custom ?
</p>
<p>Yours truly, LUM.

<p>His Curious Confession Other Arrests. /
</p>
<p>THE preceding pages will have given to the reader facts enough to show
</p>
<p>the difficulty of the task assumed, as well as the manner in which we
</p>
<p>went about the work. One of the greatest of the obstacles to be overcome
</p>
<p>arose from the character and habits of thought of the Anarchists them-
</p>
<p>selves. They heartily hated all law, and despised its constituted represen-
</p>
<p>tatives. The conspiracy was welt disciplined in itself, and it had been
</p>
<p>specially organized with a view to guarding its secrets from the outside
</p>
<p>world and protecting its members from the consequences of their crimes.
</p>
<p>Thus I soon found that it would require peculiar address, patience, secre
</p>
<p>tiveness and diligent work to lay bare the great plot to the world.
</p>
<p>I can find no better place than this to testify to the help given me
</p>
<p>throughout the case by Assistant State's Attorney Furthmann, whose work
</p>
<p>was a most important feature of the result finally brought before the
</p>
<p>Criminal Court.
</p>
<p>The protection of society is an interest so momentous that it would be a
</p>
<p>false modesty in me to refuse, for fear that I should be charged with egot-
</p>
<p>ism, to analyze the processes by which the conviction of the confederates
</p>
<p>in the Haymarket murder conspiracy was bought about, and accordingly I
</p>
<p>will now say, once for all, that I believe that careful, systematic detective
</p>
<p>inquiry, conducted with some brains and a good deal of grit, can unravel
</p>
<p>any plot which the enemies of law and order and our American institutions
</p>
<p>are apt to hatch. It will require tact. It will require intelligence. It may
</p>
<p>require the hardest and most persistent work that men may do but about
</p>
<p>the result there can be no doubt. Our government and our methods are
</p>
<p>strong enough for the protection of the people and the maintenance of law
</p>
<p>and order, no matter how dangerous may seem the forces arrayed against it.

</p>
<p>The various steps taken may be gathered best from the memoranda
</p>
<p>made upon the arrest of each Anarchist who had been conspicuous in his
</p>
<p>order and who was supposed to know the secret workings of the "armed
</p>
<p>sections ; " and, in reading the particulars, the general conclusion will
</p>
<p>become irresistible that the men who posed as the bloodthirsty bandits of
</p>
<p>Chicago became arrant, cringing cowards when they found themselves
</p>
<p>A PECULIAR SPECIMEN.
</p>
<p>231
</p>
<p>within the clutches of the law. In the galaxy of trembling "cranks" there
</p>
<p>were a few exceptions, notably George Engel and Louis Lirigg, but the
</p>
<p>demeanor of the common herd under arrest proved that their vaunted
</p>
<p>bravery had been simply so much talk "full of sound and fury."
</p>
<p>One of the first arrests which I made was that of Julius Oppenheimer,
</p>
<p>alias Julius Frey. This man was a peculiar genius and was possessed by
</p>
<p>an unbounded admiration for Anarchists and all their methods. He had
</p>
<p>come to America five years before and had been brought up an Anarchist.
</p>
<p>He was a Hebrew of a very
</p>
<p>pronounced type, twenty-
</p>
<p>five years of age, a butch-
</p>
<p>er by occupation, but an
</p>
<p>Anarchist in and out of
</p>
<p>season. Whenever he suc-
</p>
<p>ceeded in securing employ-
</p>
<p>ment he was sure speedily
</p>
<p>to lose it by his persistent
</p>
<p>teaching of Anarchy, and
</p>
<p>in some places people even
</p>
<p>went so far as to drive him
</p>
<p>out of town. If fortunate
</p>
<p>enough to get work in an
</p>
<p>adjoining town, he would
</p>
<p>tell his fellow workmen of
</p>
<p>his prior experience and
</p>
<p>curse what he termed his
</p>
<p>persecution for conscience'
</p>
<p>sake. Whenever his An-
</p>
<p>archist beliefs had been ex-
</p>
<p>pounded, he was promptly
</p>
<p>dismissed, and in one town
</p>
<p>he was politely informed
</p>
<p>that unless he got out in

</p>
<p>short order he was liable
</p>
<p>to find himself hanging to a tree. This sort of thing embittered him still
</p>
<p>more against society, and finally he abandoned all attempts to find work.
</p>
<p>He resolved himself into a tramp, and, in traveling from place to place,
</p>
<p>he sought to convert every other tramp he met to his revolutionary ideas.
</p>
<p>He soon learned that Chicago was regarded all over the country as the
</p>
<p>home of Socialism, its stronghold and citadel, and he made haste to reach
</p>
<p>it so that he too could become an agitator, with nothing to do and plenty to
</p>
<p>eat and drink. He had been in the city only a few days when he learned
</p>
<p>of the Socialistic haunt at No. 58 Clybourn Avenue, and there he soon

</p>
<p>From a Photograph.
</p>
<p>232 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>made the acquaintance of Lingg and other, lesser lights, whose principal
</p>
<p>aim seemed to be to loaf around the saloons, guzzle beer and talk dynamite.
</p>
<p>This pleased Oppenheimer. He had traveled many weary days, but at
</p>
<p>last he had found what he had so long sought. He was received cautiously
</p>
<p>at first, but finally with open arms. One night he attended a meeting at the
</p>
<p>number given above and heard Engel speak about killing all the police in
</p>
<p>Chicago. Oppenheimer was delighted, and on the adjournment of the
</p>
<p>meeting he grew very enthusiastic, threatening to visit dire punishment on
</p>
<p>both the police and the rich. He stepped out on the sidewalk, and, just
</p>
<p>then encountering a policeman, he ejaculated :
</p>
<p>" You old loafer, you won't live much longer ! "
</p>
<p>The words had hardly been uttered when Oppenheimer found himself
</p>
<p>prostrate in the gutter. The policeman passed on, and not one of Oppen-
</p>
<p>heimer's comrades dared to come to the Anarchist's assistance or proffer
</p>
<p>sympathy. This was a treatment he had not expected, but he smothered
</p>
<p>his wrath and continued to attend all the meetings of the "revolutionary
</p>
<p>groups." He grew stronger every day in the good graces of his comrades,
</p>
<p>and at one of their meetings he was asked, along with others, to secure some
</p>
<p>of the "good stuff" and bombs. He responded and secured a substantial
</p>
<p>outfit. When the 4th of May came he happened for some reason to be
</p>
<p>some eighteen miles out of the city, but the moment he heard of the explo-
</p>
<p>sion he hastened back at once and hunted up his old friends to help them
</p>
<p>destroy the town.
</p>
<p>On the evening of May 7 he was encountered by Officer Loewenstein at
</p>
<p>58 Clybourn Avenue, in Neff's Hall, and taken to the Larrabee Street
</p>
<p>Station. He was put into a cell and kept locked up for about a week.
</p>
<p>Gradually it began to dawn upon his mind that he was in trouble, that pos-
</p>
<p>sibly the police had secured evidence against him, and so at last he sent
</p>
<p>for me.
</p>
<p>" I see," he said, " that it is foolish to fight against law and order, but
</p>
<p>you must excuse me for my actions. I read so much of that Most trash
</p>
<p>and other books that I was really crazy. I lost my reason and did not
</p>
<p>know what I was doing. Now I will tell all I know, but I will not testify
</p>
<p>against any of these people."

</p>
<p>He was given no special assurances, but he unbosomed himself fully
</p>
<p>and became extremely useful in giving needed information. One day he
</p>
<p>said that if I would take him out in a carriage he would show where he
</p>
<p>had a lot of dynamite bombs planted, and added :
</p>
<p>"Before going after the stuff, I will show you some of the worst Anar-
</p>
<p>chists in the city, but in doing so I will tell you candidly my life is in dan-
</p>
<p>ger. If these men see me they will shoot me on the spot."
</p>
<p>He was assured that he would be fixed in such a disguise that no one
</p>
<p>would recognize him, and, consenting to go under such conditions,
</p>
<p>BURIED AMMUNITION. 233
</p>
<p>Oppenheimer was rigged out like a veritable darkey. Officers Schuettler
</p>
<p>and Loewenstein were detailed to accompany him, and together they
</p>
<p>visited Sullivan, Connor, Hoyne, Mohawk and Hurlbut Streets, where
</p>
<p>many Anarchists then lived, and where Oppenheimer pointed out the
</p>
<p>houses of many notable conspirators.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in one of the localities visited, colored people were very
</p>
<p>scarce, and it did not take the boys long to discover the sham, when they
</p>
<p>at once began shouting, " Here is a lost, crazy nigger," and they followed
</p>
<p>him, throwing bricks and stones. At other times the officers were obliged
</p>
<p>to hustle away with their " Hebrew negro," as they called him, as soon as
</p>
<p>possible. They got back to the station about eleven o'clock that evening,
</p>
<p>and, entering my office, Oppenheimer was permitted to view his ebony
</p>
<p>countenance in a mirror. He was startled by his make-up and declared
</p>
<p>that it was most artistically done.
</p>
<p>" Mein Gott, if I was asleep," he exclaimed, " and wake up, and looked
</p>
<p>in the glass, I'd think I was a real nigger."
</p>
<p>On the next day he was taken by the officers, in a carriage, to Lake
</p>
<p>View, about three miles from the city limits, to locate the bombs. It was
</p>
<p>a rainy day, and it was no easy matter for Oppenheimer to determine the
</p>
<p>right spot, although he kept a sharp look-out. He had planted them
</p>
<p>during the night, and that added to the difficulty. Finally he directed the
</p>
<p>driver to a grove used as picnic grounds, and they soon reached the spot.
</p>
<p>It now rained hard, and lightning and thunder filled the air with light and
</p>
<p>noise. Oppenheimer hesitated about alighting from the carriage.
</p>
<p>"It is dangerous," he said, "to go near the place. The bombs I have
</p>
<p>planted here are all loaded with dynamite, and charged with poisoned iron,
</p>
<p>and this heavy thunder may explode them and kill us all."
</p>
<p>Officer Schuettler said that he himself was familiar with the properties
</p>
<p>of dynamite, and assured him that there would not be the slightest danger.
</p>
<p>Oppenheimer then became somewhat braver. He jumped out and beck-
</p>
<p>oned to his companions to follow. They proceeded to the dancing-platform,
</p>
<p>in the middle of the grove, and Oppenheimer, having removed some short
</p>
<p>boards, making an opening large enough for the admission of a man's body,
</p>
<p>asked Loewenstein to take hold of his legs, and, when he shouted, to pull

</p>
<p>him out, adding that when he had been there before he had had a hard
</p>
<p>time getting out. Oppenheimer then went in. On giving the signal, he
</p>
<p>was pulled out, with one bomb in each hand. He was thus lowered and
</p>
<p>pulled out until he had produced thirteen bombs. They were of the heavy
</p>
<p>gas-pipe make, loaded with dynamite and rusty nails, with cap attachments,
</p>
<p>and ready for use in four seconds. To show that he had exercised great
</p>
<p>care to preserve the "stuff" properly, he asked to be lowered again, and
</p>
<p>this time he brought to the surface an oil-cloth table-cover, which, he ex-
</p>
<p>plained, he had used for wrapping up the bombs so that " they would not
</p>
<p>234 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>spoil on him." He also fished out of the place two large navy revolvers
</p>
<p>fully loaded. Having finished, Oppenheimer gave a sigh of relief and re-
</p>
<p>marked :
</p>
<p>" Now I feel relieved. As long as I had these things I always felt that
</p>
<p>I must do some damage with them. I had them once in the city (May 5),.
</p>
<p>and my mind was made up to throw some in the North Side Post-office. I
</p>
<p>also had determined to go to the Freie Presse office and blow up that d d
</p>
<p>Michaelis, the editor of the paper. And then I was going to kill myself."
</p>
<p>At about this time Oppenheimer possessed two large 44-caliber navy
</p>
<p>revolvers and seemed withal a desperate fellow. When the parties returned
</p>
<p>to the station he asked me to keep him there until all trouble was over, and
</p>
<p>for three months he became quite a character about the establishment.
</p>
<p>The defense in the Anarchist trial made several attempts to secure his
</p>
<p>release, but Oppenheimer declined to go. He was taken out frequently for
</p>
<p>regular exercise by one of the officers, but he always went in disguise.
</p>
<p>He proved such a valuable aid to the State that State's Attorney Grin-
</p>
<p>nell ordered his release, but as he was nervous lest some one should shoot
</p>
<p>him on regaining his full liberty, he begged me to send him to New York
</p>
<p>City. He was accordingly furnished with money and clothing and sent away.
</p>
<p>While he was at the station he gained twenty-seven pounds and declared he
</p>
<p>had never been so well taken care of in all his life. He bade all the officers
</p>
<p>who were working up the Anarchist cases good-by and was given safe
</p>
<p>escort to the depot by Officer Stift. Some time after his arrival in New
</p>
<p>York he was discovered by an Anarchist, who telegraphed to Capt. Black
</p>
<p>that he was there if wanted, but the Captain did not seem to specially care
</p>
<p>for him.
</p>
<p>The information he furnished the State was substantially as follows :
</p>
<p>"I came to Chicago May 5, 1886, in the morning. I went to Seliger's
</p>
<p>house, 442 Sedgwick Street. I know Seliger and his wife and Lauis Lingg.
</p>
<p>I am an Anarchist. I think the workingmen are not treated right in this
</p>
<p>country. I have always attended Socialistic meetings here. I have attended
</p>
<p>several meetings where the speakers would call us to arms and to all kinds
</p>
<p>of weapons, so that when the time came we could secure our rights. It
</p>
<p>was urged that we should be prepared to fight any one who would obstruct

<p>us or oppose our ideas. A meeting was held at Neff's Hall on or about last
</p>
<p>February. A man who lives on the West Side, on Milwaukee Avenue, and
</p>
<p>who keeps a toy store I do not know his name was there. He was
</p>
<p>accompanied by a young lady. Now that you show me this picture
</p>
<p>[Engel's] I will say he is the man, and he made a speech at that meeting.
</p>
<p>He told us to prepare ourselves, and if we were too poor and could not
</p>
<p>afford to buy arms, he could tell us about a weapon that was cheaper and
</p>
<p>better in its effect than arms. He then spoke of dynamite, but in his
</p>
<p>speech he always called it 'stuff.' He explained how to make dynamite
</p>
<p>bombs. He said : ' Take a gas-pipe, cut it in the length of six inches,
</p>
<p>put a woden plug in one end, fill it with dynamite, then plug the other end,
</p>
<p>OPPENHEIMERS STA TEMENT. 235
</p>
<p>and drill a small hole through one of the plugs. In this hole put a cap and
</p>
<p>fuse.' Then the bomb was complete. He also told us of a place on the
</p>
<p>West Side, near a bridge, where we could go and steal all the pipe we
</p>
<p>wanted. We could then buy the 'stuff' and make the bombs ourselves. I
</p>
<p>bought seven or eight bombs some time ago from a man named Nusser or
</p>
<p>Nuffer, at 54 West Lake Street. The man used to work for Greif. I paid
</p>
<p>him twenty-five cents apiece for them. They were dynamite bombs, and I
</p>
<p>purchased them at night. I had a little book that told all about making
</p>
<p>and using dynamite bombs. I know something about the armed group.
</p>
<p>They are not known by their names. They are known by numbers, so that
</p>
<p>the police cannot find them out in case they have done anything wrong.
</p>
<p>There never would be any more than three in a job that is, if there were
</p>
<p>any persons to be killed. Number one would find the second man, and this
</p>
<p>second man would find the third. No questions would be asked. The first
</p>
<p>man and the third man are not supposed to know each other. The first and
</p>
<p>third would know the middle man, but in case of trouble, and should there
</p>
<p>be a 'squeal,' only two parties could be given away, leaving one to get
</p>
<p>away and save himself. I have tried some of the dynamite bombs I had,
</p>
<p>and they worked splendidly. I also have a big navy revolver. Everything
</p>
<p>attempted hereafter will be done according to the instructions given in a
</p>
<p>book printed by Herr Most, of New York. Those long gas-pipe shells I see
</p>
<p>before me are like one that was shown me at Neff's Hall last winter. A
</p>
<p>man named Rau had it there and showed it to the boys. I am five years
</p>
<p>in America, and have always been a Socialist. On Wednesday morning,
</p>
<p>May 5, when I heard that there had been a bad blunder committed by our
</p>
<p>boys at the Haymarket, and read an article in the Freie Presse condemning
</p>
<p>us, I got very mad. I took my five dynamite bombs and started out to get
</p>
<p>revenge. My first intentionwas to blow up the North Side Post-office.
</p>
<p>The next place I decided to go to was the Freie Presse office to blow them
</p>
<p>up. If I found I was in danger of being captured, I made up my mind to
</p>
<p>kill myself right there and then. Lingg wanted me to cut a hole in the
</p>
<p>wall in his room to put away a lot of dynamite bombs and dynamite, but
</p>
<p>Mrs. Seliger would not let me do so. A man named Bodendick, a good
</p>
<p>Anarchist, was well known by August Spies, and considered a rank con-

</p>
<p>spirator. This is the man that went to Justice White's house and demanded
</p>
<p>$25, threatening that if he did not get it he would blow up his house.
</p>
<p>White had him arrested and locked up in jail, and for this reason Spies did
</p>
<p>not want the man known as an Anarchist, but simply as a crazy man. The
</p>
<p>Socialists or Anarchists do not care much for Spies or Schwab, but we have
</p>
<p>kept them and looked upon them as a necessary evil. I know a man
</p>
<p>named Pollinger, a saloon-keeper. He was an agent here at one time to
</p>
<p>sell arms, but he did not run things right. He was crooked. The under-
</p>
<p>standing we had was that, in case of a riot or revolution, every man
</p>
<p>should use his own judgment and do as he pleased, that is to say, commit
</p>
<p>murder, shoot people, burn buildings or do that for which he was best
</p>
<p>fitted, so long as it was in the interest of the Anarchistic society. The
</p>
<p>main idea inculcated in the little paper called the Freiheit, which I have
</p>
<p>read, is that no rights could be secured until capitalists were killed and
</p>
<p>houses were laid in ashes. If we would not take a chance on our lives, we
</p>
<p>would be slaves always. I know positively of fifty men, radical Anarchists,
</p>
<p>who stand ready to commit murder and to destroy the city by fire whenever
</p>
<p>they are called on. I know Lingg well. He is a Socialist and an Anar-
</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>chist and a very radical revolutionist. I heard him speak at 58 Clybourn
</p>
<p>Avenue, and formed my opinion of him. He told me that Seliger was a
</p>
<p>coward. He called me a coward the morning I helped Mrs. Seliger to get
</p>
<p>the guns out of the house. That morning I was in Lingg's room when
</p>
<p>Mrs. Seliger brought in a lot of lead and said to Lingg : 'Here is your
</p>
<p>lead.' Lingg then got mad at her and said : ' You are crazy.' He became
</p>
<p>very much excited, wrapped up his gun, got ready to move, and wanted me
</p>
<p>to conceal his dynamite bombs in the hall. Mrs. Seliger would not let him
</p>
<p>do so. Then Lingg was going to carry his bombs out of the house. He
</p>
<p>finally got into quite a quarrel with her and started out to get a wagon to
</p>
<p>carry away all his things. I told him to hurry up and get all his dynamite
</p>
<p>stuff away, also the printed literature he had, as there was danger that the
</p>
<p>police would be around to search the house. He looked at me and called
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>me 'a
</p>
<p>d fool and coward.' Then Lingg asked me to go to the West
</p>
<p>Side with him, as there was to be a meeting at 71 West Lake Street.
</p>
<p>Lingg saw my dynamite bombs. I had told him of them. I saw two
</p>
<p>round lead bombs in his room. I had them in my hands. Lingg told me
</p>
<p>to be careful and not let them drop, as they were loaded and might go off.
</p>
<p>They were dangerous, he said. I also saw four gas-pipe bombs in his room.
</p>
<p>Some of them were not finished. I remember now that Seliger, the Her-
</p>
<p>manns and Hubner were at the meeting in Neff's Hall last winter when
</p>
<p>Engel urged all men who had revolutionary ideas to pay attention and he
</p>
<p>would explain how to make dynamite bombs. I am glad I am arrested. I
</p>
<p>now can realize how near I was to ruin through those d d fellows mak-
</p>

</p>
<p>any one can imagine. I have given you facts, and they are true, every one
</p>
<p>of them. I will swear to them."
</p>
<p>THE next arrest was that of William Seliger. When the police had
</p>
<p>learned that Seliger's residence had been used as a bomb factory, we
</p>
<p>wanted him. He was a man about forty-five years of age, a carpenter by occu-
</p>
<p>pation, a good mechanic, very quiet and sober, but one of the most rabid
</p>
<p>of Anarchists. He had filled various positions in the "groups," and
</p>
<p>always manifested a deep interest in their meetings. He was popular with.
</p>
<p>his comrades and trusted with all their secrets. He lived at No. 442 Sedg-
</p>
<p>wick Street, in a rear building up-stairs. This was a two-story frame
</p>
<p>dwelling, and a great resort for Socialists and Anarchists. Officer Whalen
</p>
<p>had searched the house, finding it a regular dynamite magazine, and, locat-
</p>
<p>ing his man, telephoned to me that Seliger was working at Meyer's mill on
</p>
<p>the North Pier. Officer Stift and Lieut. Larsen were at once detailed, ia
</p>
<p>charge of a patrol wagon, to effect the arrest, and soon the man was pro-
</p>
<p>duced at the station May 7. When I confronted him he stubbornly
</p>
<p>refused, according to the instructions in Most's book, to answer ques-
</p>
<p>tions, but when he discovered the evidence I had against him, he broke
</p>
<p>down and said :
</p>
<p>"Captain, I will tell you all, but for Heaven's sake do not arrest my
</p>
<p>poor wife. I am to blame for all you found in my house, because I kept
</p>
<p>that man Lingg in my house against her will the poor woman ! Hang;
</p>
<p>me, but do not trouble her, for she is innocent, and God is her witness."
</p>
<p>Seliger then unbosomed himself, telling of all his connection with the
</p>
<p>Anarchists since his location in Chicago, and giving valuable information
</p>
<p>on all the "groups," their leaders, their places of meeting, their purposes,,
</p>
<p>their mode of operations, the character of the speeches made at meetings,
</p>
<p>and the manufacture of bombs at his house, giving the names of all calling
</p>
<p>or taking part in their manufacture. He gave the most important points-
</p>
<p>the State had to work on, and every detail he furnished was fully corrobor-
</p>
<p>ated by other parties subsequently arrested. He was in the confidence of
</p>
<p>Lingg, and was also a particeps criminis in the manufacture of the bombs,
</p>
<p>and gave, therefore, no hearsay statements. What was found in his
</p>
<p>house and the character of his information are fully shown in his testi-

</p>
<p>mony, given in a later chapter, as well as that of the officers during the
</p>
<p>memorable trial.
</p>
<p>After telling what he knew, Seliger was released, on the 28th of May,
</p>
<p>with instructions to report every day at the Chicago Avenue Station.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Seliger was also arrested. She was a small woman about 38 years
</p>
<p>of age. She was found at No. 32 Sigel Street on the morning of May 10.
</p>
<p>She readily consented to accompany Officer Schuettler to the station. Mrs.
</p>
<p>Seliger showed plainly that she had not been in sympathy with her husband
</p>
<p>in his revolutionary ideas, and proved a prompt and willing witness, demon-
</p>
<p>238 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>strating before she got through that she had done incalculable service to the
</p>
<p>people of the city.
</p>
<p>It was in her house that Lingg made his bombs, and when I questioned
</p>
<p>her she gave me a great deal of information concerning the man and his
</p>
<p>methods. All the statements she made and her testimony in court did not
</p>
<p>vary in the slightest details, even under the most rigid cross-examination.
</p>
<p>She was found to be a very industrious woman, a neat housekeeper, and she
</p>
<p>was highly esteemed by all her neighbors. She related how she had lived
</p>
<p>in misery ever since her husband began to take an active part in the An-
</p>
<p>archist meetings, and she stated that after Lingg came to live in the house
</p>
<p>she had not seen a pleasant hour. She had often remonstrated with her
</p>
<p>husband and pleaded with him not to attend the meetings, or read any of
</p>
<p>the Anarchist papers, but to remain at home with her.
</p>
<p>Seliger was so completely carried away by the doctrines of Johann Most,
</p>
<p>Spies and the others that he refused to listen to his wife. The moment he
</p>
<p>got into trouble, however, he became very penitent and readily accepted her
</p>
<p>advice in everything.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Seliger's experience on the 4th day of May, when she witnessed
</p>
<p>the preparation of the bombs, she described as terrible. There she was
</p>
<p>forced to remain all day, she said, seeing eight men working on the mur-
</p>
<p>derous weapons, some making one kind of bombs, some another, others
</p>
<p>fitting them and loading them with dynamite, and others again putting on
</p>
<p>the caps and fuse. Throughout the whole operation she was obliged to
</p>
<p>listen to their bloodthirsty conversation, how they would blow up the police
</p>
<p>stations, patrol wagons and fire-engine houses, kill all the militia, hurl
</p>
<p>bombs into private residences, and murder every one who opposed them.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Seliger viewed affairs differently and told the conspirators that
</p>
<p>there were more chains than mad dogs. Another thing they overlooked, she
</p>
<p>said, was their own families, and should they carry all their threats into execu-
</p>
<p>tion their families would be made to suffer to the end of their days in misery
</p>
<p>and want. Remonstrances, however, were useless.
</p>
<p>They worked until dark, and then they separated to meet in the evening
</p>
<p>at No. 58 Clybourn Avenue. Her husband and Lingg ate supper, and then
</p>
<p>the two put a lot of the bombs into a satchel and started for the designated

</p>
<p>place. Lingg carried the satchel down stairs and was followed by Seliger.
</p>
<p>This was a trying moment, but Mrs. Seliger proved equal to the emer-
</p>
<p>gency. Just as Seliger reached the third step, she grasped his arm, threw
</p>
<p>her arms about his neck, and, like a loving, devoted wife, asked him for God's
</p>
<p>sake not to become a murderer.
</p>
<p>"If you ever loved me and ever listened to me when I spoke," she
</p>
<p>whispered fervently into his ear, " I want you to listen to me now. I don't
</p>
<p>ask you to stay at home, but I want you to go with that villain and see that
</p>
<p>he does not hurt any one. Restrain him from carrying out his murderous

</p>
<p>ideas. If you do this, I will creep on my knees after you and will be your
</p>
<p>slave all my life."
</p>
<p>These tender words touched a sympathetic chord in the heart of Seliger,
</p>
<p>and he promised to do as she had requested, while she sealed the promise
</p>
<p>with a loving kiss. As subsequent events and his testimony in court proved,
</p>
<p>he faithfully carried out that promise, and by that injunction of his wife and
</p>
<p>that fervid kiss of a true woman, hundreds of lives and millions of property
</p>
<p>were saved.
</p>
<p>From the time they left the house until their return, Seliger never left for
</p>
<p>a moment the side of Lingg. During the evening Lingg was continually
</p>
<p>prompted by his own treacherous heart to throw bombs, now at a passing
</p>
<p>patrol wagon, then at some residence or into a police station, and invariably
</p>
<p>Seliger had some handy reason to proffer why such an attempt would be in-
</p>
<p>opportune at the moment. Lingg finally became suspicious and upbraided
</p>
<p>Seliger for being a coward. The night passed, and the only harm Lingg
</p>
<p>did was indirectly in the explosion of one of his bombs at the Hay-
</p>
<p>market, to the prospective happening of which he frequently alluded during
</p>
<p>the evening.
</p>
<p>It is my deliberate opinion that, had it not been for this intervention of
</p>
<p>Mrs. Seliger, hundreds of people would have been killed, and probably one-
</p>
<p>half of the North Side destroyed, that eventful night.
</p>
<p>After giving considerable information to the police Mrs. Seliger was re-
</p>
<p>leased, but kept under strict surveillance.
</p>
<p>Seliger faithfully carried out his instructions to report at the station
</p>
<p>daily for two weeks, and then he suddenly disappeared. Officer Schuettler
</p>
<p>was detailed to visit his home to ascertain the cause, and was there in-
</p>
<p>formed that Seliger had mysteriously left.
</p>
<p>"Why," inquired Mrs. Seliger, " don't you know where he is; did you
</p>
<p>not arrest him again ? "
</p>
<p>On being answered in the negative, she stated that it had been her in-
</p>
<p>tention to call on me that afternoon with a view to finding out something
</p>
<p>about her husband.
</p>
<p>It looked like a case of concealment, and Mrs. Seliger was therefore
</p>
<p>taken to the Larrabee Street Station. She immediately desired to see me,

</p>
<p>and, when I called, she informed me that three days before her husband
</p>
<p>had said : " I am going away. Don't ask me any questions. You will
</p>
<p>hear from me later," and then bade her good-by.
</p>
<p>She was under the impression that since leaving her he had been at the
</p>
<p>Chicago Avenue Station. I thought it a ruse and subjected her to a severe
</p>
<p>examination. I asked her who had been to see them and whether they had
</p>
<p>not received money from certain lawyers or others. But Mrs. Seliger could
</p>
<p>tell no different story from that she had already given, and she finally vol-
</p>
<p>unteered the guess that possibly her husband had been frightened away.
</p>
<p>A NOBLE WOMAN'S WORK. 241
</p>
<p>"If you will only allow me to go," she earnestly pleaded, "I will neither
</p>
<p>eat, drink nor sleep until I find him."
</p>
<p>I was now satisfied that she was in earnest, and, having confidence in
</p>
<p>her, I ordered her release. But from that moment she was watched night
</p>
<p>and day, more closely than ever. It was found that she visited many houses
</p>
<p>in various parts of the city, and when these places were immediately after-
</p>
<p>wards called upon by the detectives it was ascertained that she had invariably
</p>
<p>inquired for her husband and urged those who knew him to tell him to come
</p>
<p>home if they should happen to meet him ; that she was weary of life, and if
</p>
<p>he remained awaj' much longer she would not be responsible for any act of
</p>
<p>hers on her own life.
</p>
<p>After several days' ineffective search, Mrs. Seliger received a letter from
</p>
<p>her husband asking her to call and see him. She hastened at once, with a
</p>
<p>throbbing heart and a light tread, to my office. I asked her if she would
</p>
<p>work under my instructions, and she promptly consented to do everything
</p>
<p>in her power to help the police. I had come to the conclusion that it would
</p>
<p>be no easy matter to find the slippery Seliger, but that, if he was not discov-
</p>
<p>ered that day, we might at least get on his track.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Seliger was accordingly told to wait in the office a few minutes.
</p>
<p>Two men were sent for, men whom the woman would not know. I instructed
</p>
<p>them to slip through a side door and get a good view of her while unobserved.
</p>
<p>A carriage was then ordered, and the driver directed to take the woman to
</p>
<p>whatever place she might desire, and remain with her even all day and all
</p>
<p>night, if required. Mrs. Seliger stepped into the carriage, and the horses,
</p>
<p>were soon in a sharp trot. But the conveyance was not alone. No sooner
</p>
<p>had it started than the two men I have spoken of jumped into a buggy and
</p>
<p>followed the carriage south, keeping it in good view all the time.
</p>
<p>The first stop made was at a place on West Thirteenth Street. There
</p>
<p>Mrs. Seliger had to identify herself first, and thence she was directed to a
</p>
<p>place some four blocks away. Arriving there, she was sent on to Sixteenth
</p>
<p>Street, and again sent to Twelfth Street, near the limits. She was here sub-
</p>
<p>jected to a great many questions, and after she had fully proven her iden-
</p>
<p>tity she was taken to the next house and led into a dark bed-room, where
</p>
<p>she found her husband. She remained there about three hours, and then,

</p>
<p>under direction of her husband's friends, was told to drive to several other
</p>
<p>places in coder to throw any detectives that might be watching off the scent.
</p>
<p>She did so, but the two men had kept a close watch and were not to be
</p>
<p>baffled.
</p>
<p>When the carriage had started for home, one of the officers returned to
</p>
<p>the place where she had tarried so long. He represented to the occupants
</p>
<p>that he was working for Salomon & Zeisler, attorneys for the imprisoned
</p>
<p>conspirators, to whom Seliger had written a letter, and that in accordance
</p>
<p>with the request they had decided to protect him and his friends.
</p>
<p>242 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>"Seliger," said the officer, "is here, and I want to talk with him."
</p>
<p>The occupants admitted that he had been there and had had a talk with
</p>
<p>his wife, but that he was at the time on his way home with her.
</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Seliger called at the station the next afternoon (June 8).
</p>
<p>Both entered smiling, but it was quite apparent that Seliger was very
</p>
<p>nervous.
</p>
<p>" Captain," said Mrs. Seliger, " we are both here."
</p>
<p>" Yes, madam," I replied ; "I am glad you are both here on your own
</p>
<p>account."
</p>
<p>"Captain," again spoke Mrs. Seliger, "1 want my husband to testify in
</p>
<p>court against that villain Lingg. He ruined my home. He is the cause of
</p>
<p>the slaughter of all these people He is the cause of the sufferings of the
</p>
<p>women and children whose husbands and fathers attended the Anarchist
</p>
<p>meetings. Now, Captain, you see I have been faithful to my promises. I
</p>
<p>have done as I agreed. You have my husband ; he is in your power. You
</p>
<p>can do with him as you please, buf: for God's sake spare his life."
</p>
<p>Mrs. Seliger had scarcely finished her appeal when she swooned away.
</p>
<p>She had for days been wrought up with intense excitement and haunted
</p>
<p>with terrible forebodings. The climax was reached when she had executed
</p>
<p>her commission, and, trying as had been the situation for nights and days,
</p>
<p>she had courageously borne up in order that she might atone the wrongs
</p>
<p>her husband had committed despite her most earnest entreaties, and to help
</p>
<p>in some way to extricate him, who had so cruelly wronged her, from the
</p>
<p>meshes into which he had madly and ignorantly rushed. Her keen judg-
</p>
<p>ment and innate sense of right had swept aside every consideration of the
</p>
<p>apparent security his concealment might have given him, and her whole
</p>
<p>soul was centered in his delivery to the authorities that he might not eventu-
</p>
<p>ally be found and sent to an ignominious death on the gallows. That was
</p>
<p>her hope, and, much as she longed for his safety, she had bent her whole
</p>
<p>energies to seeing him brought out of concealment and placed where there
</p>
<p>might at least be a chance for his life. The struggle had been intense, and
</p>
<p>it culminated when she so pathetically asked that her husband's life might
</p>
<p>be spared. Her emotions then were at their highest tension, and as she
</p>
<p>recognized the fact that he was now at the complete mercy of the law,

<p>from which he had sought to escape, she could bear up no longer.
</p>
<p>A physician was immediately sent for, and after applying restoratives it
</p>
<p>was found she was quite a sick woman. A carriage was summoned, and she
</p>
<p>was sent home.
</p>
<p>Seliger was detained at the station until after the trial of the conspira-
</p>
<p>tors. Mrs. Seliger was a frequent caller after that trying day, and remained
</p>
<p>with him much of the time, cheering him and seeking in every way to
</p>
<p>lighten his burden, like a true, devoted and loving wife. In a subsequent
</p>
<p>conversation the circumstances in connection with her visit to her husband
</p>
<p>SAVED BY HIS WIFE. 243
</p>
<p>at his place of concealment were learned. It appears that at first he em-
</p>
<p>phatically declined to accompany her, and then gave his reasons. One day,
</p>
<p>while on his way to report at the station, he was met, he said, by a stranger,
</p>
<p>and threatened that if he ever went near the station again, or sent word ver-
</p>
<p>bally or by note or letter to me, both he and his wife would be murdered in
</p>
<p>cold blood. The threat made a marked impression on his mind. He
</p>
<p>returned home, but made no mention of it to Mrs. Seliger. He knew, he
</p>
<p>said, that the threat was meant, and, thinking to save his wife, he con-
</p>
<p>cluded to act on the warning and place hirrtself in concealment without her
</p>
<p>knowledge. He left, as already stated, and decided to keep under cover to
</p>
<p>await results.
</p>
<p>He called first at the house of a widow named Bertha Neubarth, No.
</p>
<p>1109 Nelson Street, Lake View. This was a small cottage, with a base-
</p>
<p>ment used as a tailor-shop, and, thinking it a secure place, he remained
</p>
<p>there a few days. Then he went to the house of a friend, named Gustav
</p>
<p>Belz, who lived near McCormick's factory, and remained there several
</p>
<p>days. His next move was to a house on West Twelfth Street, near the
</p>
<p>city limits, and there he remained until discovered by his wife. The letter
</p>
<p>he had sent to her was mailed by a trusted friend named Malinwitz, and
</p>
<p>the purpose he had in sending it was to ascertain if matters had changed
</p>
<p>any and if I was angry over his sudden departure. On meeting his wife,
</p>
<p>the first question he asked was as to whether the police had been watching
</p>
<p>their house, and, on being answered in the affirmative, and informed that
</p>
<p>she had even been locked up again, he asked for particulars and the cause
</p>
<p>for her release.
</p>
<p>" Capt. Schaack," she said, "let me out in order to bring you back."
</p>
<p>"I often felt sorry," answered the husband, "for going away, but I will
</p>
<p>never go back."
</p>
<p>His wife insisted that he must go back, and said :
</p>
<p>" I told the Captain that I would come and see you. The Captain said
</p>
<p>that he would give you six hours to return, and that if you did not report to
</p>
<p>his office within that time, he would surely find you and prosecute you for
</p>
<p>murder. Your chances for hanging, he said, were very good, and you need
</p>
<p>look for no mercy at his hands. He also said that he had your picture

</p>
<p>ready, to send out for your arrest on sight, and that it would be useless for
</p>
<p>you to hide or run away. I saw the picture myself, and the Captain intends
</p>
<p>to publish a large reward for your arrest."
</p>
<p>"I believe all you say," said Seliger, struggling with his feelings, "but
</p>
<p>what would you prefer, seeing me shot or killed by assassins, or hung
</p>
<p>by law?"
</p>
<p>"All these cowards making threats," replied the wife, "will be arrested.
</p>
<p>The station-houses on the North Side are now full of the murderers. I
</p>
<p>know the Captain will take care of us, and, if you are arrested, you will

</p>
<p>have no one to help you or do anything for you ; then you are sure to hang.
</p>
<p>You had better come with me to Captain Schaack."
</p>
<p>He consented, and she sent word that they would be at the station the
</p>
<p>next day. Seliger gave himself up, and Mrs. Seliger redeemed her promise.
</p>
<p>The sacrifice, in view of the uncertainties of the time, seemed great, but
</p>
<p>had it not been for the honesty and persistency of that true woman, Seliger
</p>
<p>to-day would lie in an unhonored grave. Both proved strong witnesses at
</p>
<p>the trial, and shortly after his release they left the city. Reports from
</p>
<p>them show that he has been cured of Johann Most's crazy notions. He
</p>
<p>now denounces Anarchy both in America and Germany, in which latter
</p>
<p>country he and his wife were born. He has applied himself to legitimate
</p>
<p>pursuits as a law-abiding citizen, and is prospering.
</p>
<p>Seliger, during his interview with me, recounted his connection with the
</p>
<p>Anarchists as follows :
</p>
<p>"About three years ago I noticed an article in the Arbeiter-Zeitung that
</p>
<p>the North Side group would give lessons to all who desired, in the English
</p>
<p>language. I went to Neff's Hall and I was there told that the school was
</p>
<p>only for members, and that, if I wanted to join, I could do so. I did, and a
</p>
<p>year afterwards I was elected financial secretary. In looking over the
</p>
<p>books, I found that the group had 206 members, the most of them being in
</p>
<p>arrears, but no one ceased to be a member on account of it. I found alsa
</p>
<p>that there was a great deal of wrangling and trouble among the members.
</p>
<p>One faction claimed to be revolutionary, as they were at war with capital.
</p>
<p>This contention drew the lines pretty sharply, and the Socialistic movement
</p>
<p>commenced to take a sharp character. Stellmacher, I believe, was executed
</p>
<p>in Vienna. It was on Monday, if I am not mistaken, in the month of
</p>
<p>August, 1884. My group decided to commemorate the event and glorify
</p>
<p>the man. They had posters printed, and about twenty men went to work
</p>
<p>to post them, especially in the vicinity of the churches. From that day
</p>
<p>they began talking force and dynamite. At every meeting, Stellmacher's
</p>
<p>name was mentioned and his deeds glorified. Some held that Stellmacher
</p>
<p>was simply a burglar and murderer, having burglarized the premises of
</p>
<p>Banker Eifert at Vienna and killed one of his children. Rau and Lange
</p>
<p>were always quarreling over this question. Lange maintained that it was

</p>
<p>a shame that any Socialist, Communist or Anarchist should burglarize and
</p>
<p>murder under a pretext of getting money for the cause. Every member, he
</p>
<p>said, could get enough money in a,n honest way to swell the fund for agita-
</p>
<p>tion and the destruction of capital. Lange said that he was not opposed ta
</p>
<p>the killing of capitalists in the right way, but he did not want to see chil-
</p>
<p>dren killed. Rau would uphold a contrary view. He held that it was all
</p>
<p>the same, capitalist or child, and said that the children of the rich would
</p>
<p>grow up only to learn how to enrich themselves at the expense of the work-
</p>
<p>ing people. Schnaubelt favored murder and thought that it would be best
</p>
<p>for the Anarchists to form into groups of four or five with a view to killing
</p>
<p>any one who would work against the laboring people's agitation. One or
</p>
<p>two suddenly removed would not arouse suspicion.
</p>
<p>"A cigar-maker named Hoffman became a member of the North Side
</p>
<p>group, and he was never satisfied with the rules, as he regarded them too
</p>
<p>lenient. He wanted the whole International Working People's Association
</p>
<p>SELIGER'S CONFESSIONS. 245
</p>
<p>made an armed body, but Schwab and Hermann opposed it, as they said that
</p>
<p>the Lehr und Wehr Verein filled that part of the bill. Hoffman subse-
</p>
<p>quently withdrew from the group and the military organization. He as well
</p>
<p>as Polling and Hermann wanted the Anarchists to give a commemorative
</p>
<p>entertainment on the anniversary of the Paris Commune, in March, 1885,
</p>
<p>and of the clubbing of the working people of Philadelphia by the police.
</p>
<p>His idea was that rifles should be discharged, and then a woman personat-
</p>
<p>ing the goddess of liberty should throw a chain away from her body. In
</p>
<p>this way the three men believed that the agitation for securing arms could
</p>
<p>be greatly helped. The committee for the celebration of the Commune
</p>
<p>opposed this plan, especially Neebe and Rau. Neebe held that the cele-
</p>
<p>bration of the Commune as generally planned by the committee was for the
</p>
<p>express purpose of making money to help agitation, and the other features
</p>
<p>were not necessary. Hoffman endeavored to carry through his plan, but he
</p>
<p>was knocked out. After some further wrangling he left the group and per-
</p>
<p>manently kept away. At another meeting Rau said that he desired to bring
</p>
<p>dynamite into the meetings and show how it was manufactured, but no
</p>
<p>definite action was taken.
</p>
<p>"At the beginning of last year [1885], a man named Deters declared
</p>
<p>that he was an Anarchist and was very loud in his declarations, but he was
</p>
<p>afterwards expelled for stealing tickets from the Central Labor Union.
</p>
<p>Poch always claimed to be a Communist, and he became unpopular on
</p>
<p>account of a dereliction. Haker was also a Communist, but he was expelled
</p>
<p>on account of being in arrears $3 as a member of the Southwest group.
</p>
<p>Then Lingg became a member, and from that time served as president of
</p>
<p>that group. He was always in hot words with a man named Hartwig.
</p>
<p>During the beginning of April we got quite a number of new members, and
</p>
<p>they all became strong agitators in the cause. I knew as members of the
</p>
<p>armed sections Schlomeker, a carpenter ; Stahlbaum, a carpenter, lieutenant
</p>
<p>of the first company; Petschke, secretary of the same company; Kitgus;
</p>
<p>the Riemer brothers, one a carpenter and the other a painter ; Ted, a car-
</p>
<p>penter ; Rau, Bak, Hirschberger, the Hermann brothers, all members of the
</p>
<p>Lehr und Wehr Verein; the Hageman brothers; the Lehman brothers;
</p>

<p>all carpenters, and Siebach and Niendorf, carpenters, living in Lake View.
</p>
<p>With these two exceptions and those of Lenhard and Krueger, who belonged
</p>
<p>to the Northwest group, all I have mentioned lived on the North Side.
</p>
<p>There were also Classner and Sisterer, who belonged to the Southwest
</p>
<p>group. I know a great many others who belonged to the armed forces, but
</p>
<p>J don't recall their names. They all carried revolvers. All I knew about
</p>
<p>bombs at that time was what I heard Lingg say, that the Northwest group
</p>
<p>and the Southwest groups and the Bohemians were well supplied with them.
</p>
<p>Among the Bohemian Socialists I only know Mikolanda and Hrusha and
</p>
<p>three more whose names I can't remember.
</p>
<p>"At a meeting last winter [1885] of the North Side group, Neebe stated
</p>
<p>that it was time that every comrade should supply himself with arms and
</p>
<p>should lay bombs under his pillow at night and sleep over them. Every
</p>
<p>one should practice so as to know how to handle them when necessary.
</p>
<p>Every workingman, he said, who is down on capitalists, should kill every
</p>
<p>one of them, and they should not neglect the police and the militia, because
</p>
<p>they were hired and supported by the capitalists. He said that he himself
</p>
<p>would kill one of these loafers and would not turn an eye on him. One in
</p>
<p>246 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>the audience, a barber, whose name I don't know, said that there were some
</p>
<p>among the militia and the police who would join them in case of an uprising
</p>
<p>and cited as an instance that during the riots of 1877 he had spoken to some
</p>
<p>of them and they had told him that they would not shoot at the strikers.
</p>
<p>Neebe declared that it was all the same. 'A man employed by the capi-
</p>
<p>talists,' he said, 'is my enemy, even though he is my brother.' In case of
</p>
<p>an uprising, he said, every revolutionist should use force on every corner
</p>
<p>and on the sidewalks, and should throw dynamite wherever these loafers
</p>
<p>stood or walked.
</p>
<p>"The casting of one bomb Lingg had was made of sheet-iron, and the
</p>
<p>man who manufactured it was shown to me at the office of the Arbeiter-
</p>
<p>Zeitung. Then Lingg had another casting made out of iron, which he had
</p>
<p>made at some iron foundry. I saw him have dynamite twice in a cigar-box.
</p>
<p>Before this he said to me that he had seen Spies at the Arbeiter-Zeitung
</p>
<p>office, and that Spies had told him that he would give him dynamite. This
</p>
<p>was about two months before the 4th of May. Friday preceding that day
</p>
<p>Lingg received a box, 1x2^ feet in dimensions, from the West Side, at the
</p>
<p>hands of a man whom I took to be a Bohemian. Lingg always liked the
</p>
<p>Bohemians. With a view to learning this man's address I walked over to>
</p>
<p>the West Side, and I found that he had moved to No. 661 Blue Island
</p>
<p>Avenue. One evening two others came to see Haker, and Haker told them,
</p>
<p>as I entered, that I was Seliger. One of them I knew, his name being
</p>
<p>Kaiser, a carpenter, and the other was a strongly built man of medium
</p>
<p>height and bow-legged. They were a little embarrassed and said that they
</p>
<p>did not know what to say under the circumstances. I asked them if they
</p>
<p>had bombs, and Haker spoke up and said that he would not say anything;
</p>
<p>about it, even to his brother, as he expected a search would be made of his
</p>
<p>house. But he said they would find nothing, and the other two confirmed
</p>
<p>his story. It was stated that every one should buy a book, which could be
</p>
<p>had at cost price, giving directions about the manufacture of dynamite,
</p>
<p>which could also be purchased very cheap. The North Side group bought
</p>
<p>one of these books. I was so informed by Thielen, who had seen it.
</p>
<p>"A short time after this I was elected a member of the central com-
</p>
<p>mittee, with four other delegates from the North Side group, who were

</p>
<p>Neebe, Ran, Hermann and Hubner, and as long as I was a member Neebe
</p>
<p>and Rau were continued as delegates to that committee. Spies was at the
</p>
<p>head of it. I attended seven of its meetings, and at one of our sessions,
</p>
<p>during the West Side street-car drivers' strike, Spies said that we should
</p>
<p>take part in that strike. In case the strikers should resort to force against
</p>
<p>the company and the policemen who protected it, Spies said that he. had a
</p>
<p>few bombs on hand, and he would distribute some of them to people whom
</p>
<p>he knew. At the same meeting it was proposed that a meeting should be
</p>
<p>held on the lake front the following Sunday, but there was some opposition
</p>
<p>to it. Spies, however, declared that the meeting should be held and that
</p>
<p>every one should be present, well armed. Then, in case the police should
</p>
<p>interfere to disperse the gathering, they should send them home with bloody
</p>
<p>heads. The meeting was held, but there was no interference. Spies also
</p>
<p>proposed that meetings of the committee should be held every evening at
</p>
<p>the Arbeiter-Zeitung office during the strike, to hear grievances, and that,
</p>
<p>whenever necessary, special meetings should be held of the various groups.
</p>
<p>The leaders in the committee were Spies, Rau, Neebe, Hermann, a man
</p>
<p>named Walter, of the American group, and a small man from the Northwest

</p>
<p>group with an illuminated nose, who was a very intimate friend of Spies.
</p>
<p>This man was the founder of the Freiheit group.
</p>
<p>"Just preceding this car strike, Haker, who belonged to Carpenters'
</p>
<p>Union No. i, was a strong advocate of the use of dynamite. At one meet-
</p>
<p>ing he told some of the members to wait till after adjournment, as he ex-
</p>
<p>plained that he desired to show them something very interesting. They
</p>
<p>remained, and he produced a ball of clay, having two parts joined together
</p>
<p>and a cavity in the center. He told them that he manufactured them, and
</p>
<p>if any one desired any they could get them from him at a dollar each. I
</p>
<p>then left.
</p>
<p>" Subsequently I called upon Secretary Lotz and asked for the book of
</p>
<p>membership of the North Side group. I found that Charles Bock was its
</p>
<p>financial secretary ; Hubner, librarian ; and Rau, delegate to the central
</p>
<p>committee, which position he held almost continuously. Abraham Hermann
</p>
<p>was also a delegate and agent for the sale of arms to the whole organiza-
</p>
<p>tion. The principal speakers at our meetings were Schwab, Feltes or
</p>
<p>Veltes, Neebe, Grottkau and (while living in the city) Kraemer. During
</p>
<p>1885 an Austrian, whose name I don't remember, spoke very often, but he
</p>
<p>is now at the Jefferson Insane Asylum. Fischer is one of the founders of
</p>
<p>the North Side group and always spoke most strongly in favor of Anarchy.
</p>
<p>Rau, an employe of the Ar better -Zeitungy Lingg, Schnaubelt and Emil Hoffman,
</p>
<p>the cigar-maker, also spoke frequently. Hoffman claimed that he was a
</p>
<p>great friend of Most and one of the founders of Freiheit of London. He had
</p>
<p>lived in London several years and was an active member until he left our
</p>
<p>organization, as I have already stated. Hermann would sometimes take the
</p>
<p>places of speakers who might happen to be absent from some of the meet-
</p>
<p>ings. Hirschberger, of the Arbeiter-Zeitung, and Menz, a carpenter, born
</p>
<p>in America, generally participated in some of the discussions.
</p>
<p>"A man named Kiesling was a member, and after my liberation from
</p>
<p>the station I was informed by Haker, Kaiser and another man that he had
</p>
<p>helped a member to escape arrest. Commes, or Commens, had shot and
</p>
<p>wounded two Jews, and Kiesling was delegated to take him in an express
</p>
<p>wagon to Lake View, where he turned him over to some members of the
</p>
<p>Southwest Side group, who then assisted him in effecting his escape."

<p>Seliger then gave a number of names of members who belonged to the
</p>
<p>groups he was most familiar with, as follows:
</p>
<p>" North Side Group. Asher, a mason ; Turban, carpenter ; Huber, car-
</p>
<p>penter ; Heuman, railroad laborer ; Stak, cornice-maker ; Reuter; Habitz-
</p>
<p>reiter, of the Arbeiter-Zeitung ; Kasbe, shoemaker; Menge, carrier of

</p>
<p>Behrens, shoemaker. Members no longer with group : Wichman, a saloon-
</p>
<p>keeper, expelled from Berlin, Germany ; Ammer, bookbinder ; the Thiesen
</p>
<p>brothers, One a shoemaker and the other a carpenter, and Polling.
</p>
<p>" Northwest Side Group. Blume, carpenter ; Elias, carpenter ; Fischer,
</p>
<p>Engel, Lehnhard, Breitenfeld. Blume and Elias left because they were
</p>
<p>quarreling all the time with Fischer, and they founded the Karl Marx
</p>
<p>group.
</p>
<p>"Southwest Side Group. Scholz ; Fehling,cigarmaker ; Kaiser, carpenter ;
</p>
<p>Haker, carpenter ; Schoening."
</p>
<p>248 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>THE next arrest was that of JOHN THIELEN. Thielen was a man about
</p>
<p>37 year of age, born near the city of Coblentz, Germany, a carpenter by oc-
</p>
<p>cupation, and a rabid "red," living in Chicago at No. 509 North Halsted
</p>
<p>Street. He had been an Anarchist in the old country, and there had divided
</p>
<p>his time between talking up the social revolution and running a small
</p>
<p>grocery store, until business had got so dull that he was obliged to sell out.
</p>
<p>He then fell back upon his trade for a living. Much as it went against his
</p>
<p>grain to labor, he had no alternative except to starve. It occurred to him
</p>
<p>that the stronger a Socialist he became the less hard work he would have to
</p>
<p>do, and he accordingly availed himself of every opportunity to talk on his
</p>
<p>pet hobby. At last the officials of Emperor William got after him, and,
</p>
<p>packing up a few things, he emigrated to America, reaching Chicago about
</p>
<p>five years before his arrest. He had been here only a short time when he
</p>
<p>learned that there were a number of men in the city who talked to working-
</p>
<p>men about the shortest way to get rich without
</p>
<p>work", how to have a good time playing cards,
</p>
<p>drinking beer, attending picnics and balls, wear-
</p>
<p>ing good clothes, and smoking good cigars. This
</p>
<p>struck Thielen's fancy, and he concluded that
</p>
<p>at last he had found the place he had longed
</p>
<p>for during many years. He decided to identify
</p>
<p>himself with these men, and accordingly made
</p>
<p>haste to attend all their meetings. It was not
</p>
<p>long before he proved himself as good an An-
</p>
<p>archist as the rest of the leaders. His wife also
</p>
<p>had become imbued with his doctrines, and had
</p>
<p>grown indeed more positive than her husband.

<p>fellow. Nothing would satisfy the mother except
</p>
<p>his induction into the order. After the stripling had become a member,
</p>
<p>she was still unsatisfied ; he must join the Sharpshooters. This the boy
</p>
<p>did, and thus he fell in with the most rabid of the Anarchists into the
</p>
<p>very crowd that gathered in secret session at 63 Emma Street on Sunday,

<p>May 2, at ten o'clock in the morning, to hear Engel unfold his murderous
</p>
<p>The youth was a close listener and an ardent admirer of the leaders.
</p>
<p>He also attended the Haymarket meeting, and went there for a purpose.
</p>
<p>It appears that the order had established, in furtherance of this conspiracy,
</p>
<p>a line of runners, composed of all the young men who were swift and light
</p>
<p>of foot, the object being to furnish means of rapid communication between
</p>
<p>a "commander" and his men. For instance, in the execution of Engel's
</p>
<p>plan, a number of Anarchists had gone to Wicker Park, some to Humboldt
</p>
<p>Park, and others to Garfield Park, on the evening of May 4. Their instruc-
</p>
<p>A BOY CONSPIRATOR. 249
</p>
<p>tions were to stand ready to obey orders, and, on receipt of a signal, to
</p>
<p>advance into the city and shoot down all who opposed them. The "com-
</p>
<p>mander" attended the Haymarket meeting, accompanied by young Thielen,
</p>
<p>and it was his intention, the moment the proper signal was given, to
</p>
<p>despatch the boy on his mission. The boy was then to start on a keen run
</p>
<p>to a certain place, where he was to meet another runner ; the second was to
</p>
<p>take the message to a third, and so on until the men posted at the parks
</p>
<p>were reached.
</p>
<p>Fortunately, however, young Thielen missed his "commander" when the
</p>
<p>bomb fell and the shooting commenced at the Haymarket. The boy then
</p>
<p>lost his courage, like his superior, and applied his speed to getting home
</p>
<p>as fast as possible.
</p>
<p>Young Thielen had been selected because of his supposed coolness. He
</p>
<p>had been a great favorite of Lingg's, and had been in that worthy's room on
</p>
<p>that very afternoon up to 7:30 in the evening. He had even helped to load
</p>
<p>dynamite bombs there. When the work had been completed, Lingg had
</p>
<p>distributed a lot of the dynamite left over to his friends present. Three
</p>
<p>boxes had been given to Thielen and the boy, and the "stuff" was subse-
</p>
<p>quently found buried under their house, together with fire-arms and ammu-
</p>
<p>nition.
</p>
<p>When trouble finally surrounded the Thielen household, the wife and
</p>
<p>mother showed true grit. On being shown the evidence of their complicity
</p>
<p>in a conspiracy, she neither flinched nor quivered.
</p>
<p>" Our whole family are Anarchists," she defiantly remarked, " and what
</p>
<p>of it ? Try your best, you can't scare me ! "
</p>
<p>The son was ordered by the officers to come with them to the station, and
</p>
<p>as they left the house Mrs. Thielen said to him :
</p>
<p>" I want you to brace up and be firm, as you have been taught by your
</p>
<p>comrades. This is for a good cause. Bear it all like a man."
</p>
<p>The boy was taken to the Larrabee Street Station and put under cross-
</p>
<p>fire. He was decidedly firm at first, but after he had become involved in a
</p>
<p>number of false statements and shown that the police knew a good deal
</p>
<p>about him, he looked at every officer in the station and asked :
</p>
<p>" If I tell all I know and tell the truth, what will you do with me ?'

</p>
<p>He was informed that such a course would be the best for him and that
</p>
<p>it might afford him a chance to get out of his troubles. This satisfied the
</p>
<p>youth, and he gave a long and strong statement, which others subsequently
</p>
<p>corroborated. He then explained that he had been misled into reading all
</p>
<p>sorts of nonsense on Anarchy. He had eagerly studied all books on the
</p>
<p>question, and, being encouraged by his parents, had taken a deep interest
</p>
<p>in all the meetings. He worked whenever he could find employment, but
</p>
<p>at all times his mind was centered in the success of the cause.
</p>
<p>He was detained at the station only a few days, and then released on a

<p>250 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>promise to hold himself subject to the orders of the State and testify when
</p>
<p>called on. But the State did not need his evidence, and soon thereafter I
</p>
<p>secured him employment in a factory. He is still at work and is now prov-
</p>
<p>ing himself an exemplary youth.
</p>
<p>The father proved a rather elusive individual after the police began
</p>
<p>searching for him. But at the time of Mrs. Seliger's arrest he ventured
</p>
<p>too near the Chicago Avenue Station. It was on the morning of May 12
</p>
<p>that a man was noticed in the company of two women. The man remained
</p>
<p>on the outside at a good distance, but the women entered the court-room of
</p>
<p>the station and sat there for some time, watching the prisoners brought
</p>
<p>before the magistrate. The women asked no questions of any one in the
</p>
<p>room, and it was soon discovered that they had no business there. Officer
</p>
<p>Loewenstein approached them and asked if they had come to see Mrs.
</p>
<p>Seliger. One replied that they did not know her.
</p>
<p>" But," interposed the other, with some hesitancy, "is she here?"
</p>
<p>"I can't tell," remarked the officer. "I was going to make some
</p>
<p>inquiries, but as you do not know her, it will save me the trouble."
</p>
<p>" Say, young man," said one of the women, who was getting interested
</p>
<p>as well as curious, " what is your business here ? "
</p>
<p>" Well, madam, I am known here as a ' straw-bailer. ' I go bail for all
</p>
<p>people who pay me well, and I am all O. K. with the police. If you want
</p>
<p>anything done for Mrs. Seliger, you must be very careful here. Don't let
</p>
<p>the police know your object. As you are Germans, I will not charge you
</p>
<p>anything for my trouble, if I can do anything for you."
</p>
<p>" Well, we will talk to you later," they said. " Can we remain here for
</p>
<p>awhile ? "
</p>
<p>" Oh, yes ; I will take care of you so that no one will disturb you," replied
</p>
<p>the officer, in a patronizing tone of voice. " By the way, when I came to
</p>
<p>the station this morning, I saw you standing at the corner talking to a gen-
</p>
<p>tleman with black whiskers, and he is now standing across the street. If he
</p>
<p>is a friend of yours, I will call him in here."
</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," responded the women, " he is our friend and a friend of Mr,
</p>
<p>and Mrs. Seliger. He is a good man."
</p>
<p>" What is his name ? I will call him in at once."

<p>" His name is John Thielen. He lives at No. 509 North Halsted Street
</p>
<p>and is all right."
</p>
<p>Officer Stift meantime had kept his eye on the individual across the
</p>
<p>street, with instructions not to arrest him so long as he hovered about the
</p>
<p>station, but, in the event of his going away any distance, to take him in
</p>
<p>charge. The man at no time went far from his post ; he was too anxious
</p>
<p>to hear from the women. The moment Officer Loewenstein had secured
</p>
<p>the information about his identity, he posted across the street, and, hailing
</p>
<p>the man, said :
</p>
<p>AN "INNOCENT" TAKEN IN. 251
</p>
<p>"John, I think you have been 'ransacking ' around here long enough.
</p>
<p>Come with me ; the boys want to see you."
</p>
<p>" Who are the boys ? " inquired Thielen.
</p>
<p>"Capt. Schaack," answered the officer.
</p>
<p>"I don't want to see him or have anything to do with him." Thielen
</p>
<p>was surprised as well as indignant.
</p>
<p>" Well," said the officer, "he would like to make your acquaintance."
</p>
<p>" You tell him that he don't know me and I don't know him ; so what
</p>
<p>the d 1 does he want ? Good-day, I am going home."
</p>
<p>"You must come in first and give an account of yourself."
</p>
<p>" I am a good man ; I am not afraid."
</p>
<p>He went to the station rather reluctantly, still with an air of innocence
</p>
<p>and bravery. The moment he stepped inside the office, I said to him :
</p>
<p>" John, you are an Anarchist. You are one of the rioters. You were at
</p>
<p>the Haymarket meeting. You knew about the bombs. You are under
</p>
<p>arrest."
</p>
<p>"I am no Anarchist," responded John, rather warmly. "I am a
</p>
<p>carpenter. "
</p>
<p>"Yes," said I, "you are both, and you live at 509 North Halsted Street.
</p>
<p>I have no time now to talk to you. Whenever you want to see me send
</p>
<p>word by the turnkey."
</p>
<p>On the second day, John sent word that he wanted to see me. He was
</p>
<p>taken up into the office, and there he asked what benefit it would be to him
</p>
<p>if he told all he knew. He was informed that we would expect him to tell
</p>
<p>only the truth and not lie about any one or shield any one who was guilty
</p>
<p>of wrong-doing. If he did all this honestly and conscientiously the State
</p>
<p>would, no doubt, reward him for his information. Thielen assented to the
</p>
<p>proposition, but he told very little at this interview. He was brought up
</p>
<p>again the next day, and from the questions put he soon discovered that
</p>
<p>some one had been telling the truth about him.
</p>
<p>"Now I will tell you all I know," he said, "and let it fall where it
</p>
<p>belongs. What I say I will swear to. I see every one is trying to get out.
</p>
<p>First I will tell you what I did myself, and then what the others did."
</p>
<p>He accordingly made a long statement, but as substantially the same

</p>
<p>facts were brought out in the trial by other witnesses, he was never called
</p>
<p>on to testify. Since then Thielen has abandoned Anarchy and is a better
</p>
<p>man.
</p>
<p>The statement Thielen made runs as follows, and it will be noticed by
</p>
<p>reference to the trial proceedings that, had he been a witness, he would
</p>
<p>have fully corroborated the testimony given by Seliger and his wife. On
</p>
<p>being shown, at the station, some round lead bombs, he said :
</p>
<p>" I saw Louis Lingg have twenty-two pieces like these in his room.
</p>
<p>They were not all finished. I saw them when they were being cast. They
</p>
<p>2 5 2 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>were in halves and placed in Louis Lingg's trunk. If that trouble had not
</p>
<p>occurred at McCormick's factory that Monday, they would not have been
</p>
<p>finished yet, but after that trouble with the officers he completed them.
</p>
<p>That is, he loaded them with dynamite, ready to be used. I never knew of
</p>
<p>any one or heard of anybody who could make these bombs except Lingg.
</p>
<p>I had two of these gas-pipe bombs, loaded with dynamite. I got them from
</p>
<p>Lingg, and I threw them away as soon as I got them. There were only a
</p>
<p>few left of these long ones. There were seventeen pieces loaded at Seli-
</p>
<p>ger's house. Bonfield had better look out for himself, as these bombs are
</p>
<p>for the most part made for him, and he will get one yet. He was shooting
</p>
<p>the people during the West Side car strike and at McCormick's. I prom-
</p>
<p>ised to give you the round bombs that I had, but, as I said, I threw them
</p>
<p>away and out of danger. I will tell you, before all these men, that these
</p>
<p>two iron shells now lying before me at this table I got from Lingg at his
</p>
<p>house, No. 442 Sedgwick Street, on May 4, 1886. He gave them to me,
</p>
<p>and I took them along home. They were loaded, and there was a fuse in
</p>
<p>each of them. This was Tuesday night, May 4, 8 o'clock. The very same
</p>
<p>night he also gave me those two cigar-boxes here now before me, filled
</p>
<p>with dynamite. He wanted me to take them and throw them in the alley.
</p>
<p>He said they were empty, but I saw that they were filled. They were too
</p>
<p>heavy to be empty. I took them home myself, together with my boy. We
</p>
<p>buried them under our house. The last time I saw any bombs was at
</p>
<p>Florus' place, where a search was made by the police. I would have given
</p>
<p>up those bombs to you to-night if you had not found them. In these boxes
</p>
<p>is finished dynamite ready to be used. I know Seliger had charge of sell-
</p>
<p>ing arms. We paid $7.00 for a revolver and $10.00 for a gun. I saw
</p>
<p>Lingg and Seiiger at Seliger's house, Tuesday, May 4, at about 8 P.M., and
</p>
<p>9:30 P.M. I saw them together at Larrabee Street. There were twenty-
</p>
<p>two lead bombs that I saw in Lingg's room. They were made on a Sunday
</p>
<p>afternoon. Lingg, Seliger and myself made them. They had been cast
</p>
<p>about two weeks before Tuesday, May 4. I saw in a satchel in Lingg's
</p>
<p>room about fifteen pieces of these long iron shells, on Tuesday, May 4.
</p>
<p>There were alsp some round lead bombs, and they were all loaded. The
</p>
<p>time I was in Lingg's room, May 4, I saw one man take along with him,

</p>
<p>when he left, three round lead bombs loaded with dynamite, and Lingg
</p>
<p>gave those bombs to the man himself. I know the man, and I, John Thie-
</p>
<p>len, will get them from that man and give them to you this evening. After
</p>
<p>what happened at the Haymarket on that Tuesday evening, May 4, you
</p>
<p>could not hear of any one having bombs in their possession. I should
</p>
<p>judge that two men more received from Lingg six round bombs loaded
</p>
<p>with dynamite. In Greif's Hall, 54 West Lake Street, on the evening of
</p>
<p>May 3, at the meeting there, Lingg said to the people present that he would
</p>
<p>furnish the dynamite bombs if any one would throw them. I told him to
</p>
<p>throw the bombs himself. Then I said to Lingg that it would cost a man
</p>
<p>his life to throw them. Lingg replied that no man could see any one throw
</p>
<p>one of them. He said if necessary he would throw some. He also
</p>
<p>stated that if any one would come to him he would show him how to
</p>
<p>make bombs with dynamite. I saw Lingg and Seliger together at Thiir-
</p>
<p>inger Hall Neff's place 58 Clybourn Avenue, on the evening of May 4.
</p>
<p>Lingg had a satchel. The satchel was placed near a little passage-way
</p>
<p>leading to the 'gents' closet.' It was a gray canvas-covered satchel about
</p>
<p>two feet long, one foot wide and one and a half feet high. Seliger, Lingg
</p>
<p>JOHN THIELEN'S REVELATIONS. 253
</p>
<p>and myself went away together to Clybourn Avenue. We then went up
</p>
<p>on Larrabee Street, at 9:30 P.M. I left Lingg and Seliger at the corner
</p>
<p>of Clybourn Avenue and Larrabee Street. The satchel was brought by
</p>
<p>Lingg to Neff's Hall that night, and any one there could help himself to
</p>
<p>bombs. Lingg said to some people : ' There are bombs in that satchel, and
</p>
<p>now help yourselves. ' These words were spoken in the saloon of Neff's
</p>
<p>place to a crowd of armed men."
</p>
<p>The above confession was given on the i4th of May. On the next day
</p>
<p>Thielen was brought face to face with Lingg with what results the next
</p>
<p>chapter will show. On the i6th of May Thielen supplemented his first
</p>
<p>statement with additional particulars. He said :
</p>
<p>"On Tuesday, May 4, 1886, about 9:30 P.M., myself and old man Leh-
</p>
<p>man were together on the corner of North Avenue and Larrabee Street,
</p>
<p>near the police station, and afterwards we went back to Neff's Hall. Three
</p>
<p>men came into the saloon and said that there had been a terrible explosion
</p>
<p>on the West Side at the Haymarket meeting and that a great many were
</p>
<p>killed and wounded ; that Fielden had made a speech, and a radical one.
</p>
<p>The police came, and a shot was fired. Some one in the crowd said : ' Now,
</p>
<p>do not spare powder or lead. ' A friend of mine got shot through the cheek.
</p>
<p>The man works for Mr. Christal, corner of Lake and State Streets, in a
</p>
<p>basement a carpenter-shop. That man stated that he was there at the
</p>
<p>meeting, standing near the speaker, and about fifteen feet away from where
</p>
<p>the bomb was thrown. The understanding with us when we left Neff's
</p>
<p>Hall on that Tuesday night, May 4, was to make a racket that would
</p>
<p>call out the police. It was a failure because the West Side police did not
</p>
<p>come out any sooner to interfere with the meeting or the mob. The grudge
</p>
<p>we had was the score of the police shooting our men at McCormick's fac-
</p>
<p>tory. We wanted revenge. The order came from the International armed

<p>men or the group. I was at Greif's Hall, 54 West Lake Street, May 3. I
</p>
<p>there saw a circular calling for revenge. I was at the meeting Monday
</p>
<p>night at Zepf's Hall, and there an order was given for the armed men to go
</p>
<p>to 54 West Lake Street, in the basement. The password to get into that
</p>
<p>meeting was ' Y komme. ' I went there to the meeting. I found George
</p>
<p>Engel there, and he made a speech. The whole plan was then unfolded by

<p>Engel. He said that there would be a meeting held on Tuesday night, May
</p>
<p>4, at the Haymarket, and that the North Siders should stay on the North
</p>
<p>Side, and there they should wait until it had started meaning the riot on
</p>
<p>the West Side. Engel said that some of those who had arms should come
</p>
<p>to the meeting, and those who had no arms should stay away from the meet-
</p>
<p>ing at the Haymarket. At the meeting in the basement a man by the name of
</p>
<p>Waller was chairman. George Engel did the speaking. There were about
</p>
<p>fifty men present belonging to the armed sections. Engel explained that the
</p>
<p>plan would have to be worked in this way : As soon as they had commenced
</p>
<p>on the West Side, then they should commence on the South Side and the
</p>
<p>North Side. Engel stated that the signal would be a fire which would be
</p>
<p>set, and seen at Wicker Park, and by the noise of the shooting. That would
</p>
<p>be the signal for commencing, and they should all attack the police stations ;
</p>
<p>should throw dynamite bombs into the stations, to either kill or keep the
</p>
<p>officers in the stations, and should shoot the horses on the patrol wagons to
</p>
<p>prevent the police from helping one another. Engel is the man who pro-
</p>
<p>1254 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>posed this plan. Engel is the only man that gave us any orders. And
</p>
<p>under the orders Engel gave us that night, May 3, in that basement, 54 West
</p>
<p>Lake Street, we started out May 4 on the North Side to do harm that is,
</p>
<p>to shoot and kill anything that opposed us. The word ' Ruhe ' in the
</p>
<p>' Briefkasten ' was adopted at our meeting May 3. It was to be used as a
</p>
<p>signal word. If it should appear the next day in the Arbeiter-Zeitung, then
</p>
<p>every man was to be ready with his arms or guns ; that then the riot would
</p>
<p>commence, and they should watch for the signal. ' Right and fest ' were
</p>
<p>passwords for the armed men should there be any fighting at McCormick's.
</p>
<p>With the signal they should all come out with their bombs and arms, no
</p>
<p>matter whether it happened in the day or in the night. They should attack
</p>
<p>the armed officers of the law and the State militia. All of us armed men
</p>
<p>thought at one time that the police would not fight us, because they were all
</p>
<p>married men, and if they should fight us they would not do it so very hard.
</p>
<p>The plan was to call out a meeting first and have no speakers there. The
</p>
<p>police would then come and drive us away. They then should fire on the
</p>
<p>police. There were a lot of armed people at the meeting, I know. But the
</p>
<p>police did not interfere, so they got speakers at the meeting. Finally the
</p>
<p>police came out, and the mob-did what they had agreed to do. Afterwards
</p>
<p>fault was found, and they said the North Siders were cowards. When Spies
</p>
<p>and others were arrested, the armed men all said that, should anything hap-
</p>
<p>pen to those men, there would be a riot. In reference to the report about
</p>
<p>the shooting of six of our men at McCormick's factory, I will say that what
</p>
<p>I saw and read in that circular calling for revenge made me mad at the offi-
</p>
<p>cers. At that meeting Engel called on us to take revenge on the police
</p>
<p>officers, because they had killed six of our men. There were about seventy-
</p>
<p>five of us, so far as I know, on the North Side, to do the work on Tuesday
</p>
<p>night, May 4, and Lingg was mad because there were no more men coming
</p>
<p>after bombs. At Neff's Hall Tuesday night, May 4, we all looked to Lingg
</p>
<p>as a leader of the North Siders. I know of no one else who could make
</p>
<p>bombs. Some one found fault with Lingg at Neff's Hall on Tuesday night
</p>
<p>because he came so late with his bombs. Then Lingg asked why they had
</p>
<p>not come after the bombs. They all knew, he said, where he lived. Lingg
</p>
<p>was very angry. Schablinsky lives near me, and he got bombs from him.

<p>There were about nineteen men in the vicinity of the Chicago Avenue Sta-
</p>
<p>tion on the night of May 4, to attack the station when the police should
</p>
<p>come out on the wagons to answer a call from the West Side Haymarket.
</p>
<p>The men, seeing all this, lost their courage because the police, they said,
</p>
<p>passed them so quick, and then they said to one another, * Why should we
</p>
<p>attack and lose our own lives for the sake of others ? ' When the wagon
</p>
<p>was gone, they saw lots of officers coming on foot to the station. Then the
</p>
<p>men went away. The North Siders, the armed men, were to meet in Neff's
</p>
<p>Hall May 4, in the afternoon. I was at Thalia Hall, Northwest Side, where
</p>
<p>the Lehr und Wehr Verein met, on Wednesday, May 5, in the forenoon.
</p>
<p>I saw Fischer, and he said Spies and others had been arrested. I always
</p>
<p>knew that Fischer was one of the leaders in this affair the riot. Fischer
</p>
<p>said the riot was a failure. It was botched, and nothing could be done any
</p>
<p>more. On Tuesday afternoon there was a tall young fellow at Lingg's room
</p>
<p>about six o'clock. He had a smooth face and was about six feet tall. The
</p>
<p>tall man and Lingg were working at the bombs and dynamite. The tall
</p>
<p>man, I think, worked at Brunswick & Balke's factory."
</p>

</p>
<p>The foregoing was read to Thielen and its correctness acknowledged
</p>
<p>before Mr. Furthmann, the officers and myself, and his signature is affixed
</p>
<p>to the margin of each sheet of the paper on which it is written. Thielen's
</p>
<p>stepson, William Schubert, confirmed the statement of his father with refer-
</p>
<p>ence to the dynamite bombs and the cigar-boxes filled with dynamite, and
</p>
<p>added :
</p>
<p>"I went under the house and dug a hole in the ground, and father and
</p>
<p>myself put those things in the hole and then covered them up."
</p>
<p>ABOUT the time of Thielen's arrest Officers Hoffman and Schuettler ran
</p>
<p>across FRANZ LORENZ on North Avenue near Sedgwick Street, in the very
</p>
<p>stronghold of Anarchy, and as the man seemed to be suffering from an
</p>
<p>overdose of Anarchy and liquor, they took him to the station. This was
</p>
<p>on the loth of May. He was a German, 48 years of age, and lived with a
</p>
<p>man named Jaeger, at No. 31 Burling Street. He did not seem to be
</p>
<p>known much in Socialist circles, and no one seemed specially interested in
</p>
<p>him. He was locked up at the Larrabee Street Station, and for four days
</p>
<p>he was as stupid as an owl. He would eat and drink very little, but
</p>
<p>managed to sleep every day. On the sixth day he was taken to the Chicago
</p>
<p>Avenue Station and remained there two days longer before he recovered his
</p>
<p>normal condition. When brought into the office, he told me that he had
</p>
<p>been drinking very hard, and, being asked for the reason, he said that he
</p>
<p>had attended many Anarchist meetings, had heard all the speeches and had
</p>
<p>learned that soon they would all have plenty of money. Whenever such
</p>
<p>assurances were given, it always, he said, made him feel so good that he
</p>
<p>would go and get one more drink. Between speeches and drinks, he said, he
</p>
<p>had come near dying. He assured me that if he was released he would go
</p>
<p>right to work and give Anarchy and all meetings a wide berth. On being
</p>
<p>questioned as to his acquaintances, he said he knew "all the boys" the
</p>
<p>leading Anarchists and had admired them warmly.
</p>
<p>"1 heard Lingg speak," said he, "and he is a good one. I tell you he
</p>
<p>is a radical."
</p>
<p>"I suppose," said I, "you took two drinks on his speech?"
</p>
<p>"Yes, I took more than that," replied Lorenz. "The last time I heard
</p>
<p>Lingg speak in Zepf's Hall, I went and got drunk. On May 4, I heard all

<p>the boys speak on the wagon at the Haymarket, but I did not stay there
</p>
<p>until it was over. I went into a saloon a block away from there and got
</p>
<p>drunk in no time, and when I woke up the next morning I was in bed in
</p>
<p>one of the cheap lodging-houses."
</p>
<p>Not knowing anything definite, he was released by the State's Attorney,
</p>
<p>and he has not since been heard from. He has probably retired to some
</p>
<p>other city to renew his drunks at Anarchist headquarters on the free beer
</p>
<p>usually provided.

</p>
<p>WITH the information already obtained we had managed to secure a
</p>
<p>pretty clear insight into the diabolical plots of the "revolutionary
</p>
<p>groups. " It was apparent that Chicago had been regarded by Anarchists
</p>
<p>everywhere as the head center of Socialism in America, and that it had been
</p>
<p>decided that here should be the first test of strength in the establishment of
</p>
<p>the new social order. Any reasoning, sentient being ought to have seen the
</p>
<p>utter folly of such an undertaking in the very midst of millions of liberty-
</p>
<p>loving, law-abiding citizens, but these Anarchists, hypnotized as they were
</p>
<p>by the plausible sophisms and the inflammatory writings of unscrupulous
</p>
<p>men bent on notoriety, could view it in no other light than as a grand stride
</p>
<p>towards their goal. As boys are led astray by yellow-covered literature,
</p>
<p>these poor fools were crazed by Anarchistic vaporings. Day or night,
</p>
<p>sleeping or waking, the beauties of the new social order to be inaugurated
</p>
<p>by the revolution were continually before their minds.
</p>
<p>It was clear that such people were capable of desperate deeds, and that
</p>
<p>it was not only necessary to bring to justice the instigators of the massacre,
</p>
<p>but to show their deluded followers the inevitable result of carrying out
</p>
<p>ideas repugnant to our free institutions and inconsistent with common sense
</p>
<p>and right.
</p>
<p>With so many facts before us, we redoubled our efforts to capture every
</p>
<p>dangerous Anarchist leader in the city, and the next one to fall into the toils
</p>
<p>was no less a personage than the bomb-maker, Louis Lingg.
</p>
<p>This notorious Anarchist came to Chicago when about twenty-one years of
</p>
<p>age. He had learned the carpenter's trade in Germany, and when not engaged
</p>
<p>in spreading Anarchy's doctrines, he pursued that calling to liquidate his
</p>
<p>board bills and personal expenses. He was a tall, lithe, well-built, hand-

<p>some fellow, and, while not of a nervous disposition, his nature was so
</p>
<p>active and aggressive that he never appeared at rest. Sleeping or waking,
</p>
<p>Anarchy and the most effective methods of establishing it were uppermost
</p>
<p>in his thoughts. By reason of his very restlessness it was not difficult to
</p>
<p>trace him in Socialistic circles when on his tours of agitation, and it was
</p>
<p>noticeable, too, that he never remained at any one point for any regular

</p>
<p>length of time. His make-up was a queer combination of nerve, energy
</p>
<p>and push. His mind seemed always weighted with some great burden.
</p>
<p>Perhaps there was a reason for this not alone in his radical beliefs, but in
</p>
<p>his blood and birth.
</p>
<p>Louis Lingg was born in Schwetzingen, Germany, on the gth day of
</p>
<p>September, 1864, and, while his childhood was spent pleasantly enough, a
</p>
<p>cloud gradually gathered which overshadowed his life and embittered him
</p>
<p>against society. His mother, at the age of eighteen or twenty, had worked
</p>
<p>as a servant, and, possessing a very handsome face, a shapely figure and
</p>
<p>attractive manners, had caught the eye of a Hessian soldier in the dragoons.
</p>
<p>This man was young, dashing and handsome, and mutual admiration soon
</p>
<p>ripened into undue intimacy.
</p>
<p>One day the soldier left town
</p>
<p>on short notice whether
</p>
<p>because of military orders
</p>
<p>or through his own inclina-
</p>
<p>tion is not known. It is cer-
</p>
<p>tain, however, that she never
</p>
<p>heard of him from that day,
</p>
<p>and that a son was born to
</p>
<p>her out of wedlock. That
</p>
<p>son was Louis Lingg. The
</p>
<p>name of that dragoon has
</p>
<p>never been made public, but
</p>
<p>it is believed with reason
</p>
<p>that Lingg was born of royal
</p>
<p>blood.
</p>
<p>Several years after her
</p>
<p>escapade the mother wed-
</p>
<p>ded a lumber-worker named
</p>
<p>Link. Louis was then four LOU is LINGG, THE BOMB-MAKER.

<p>his occupation of floating logs down the river Main, contracted heart disease,
</p>
<p>through over-exposure, and died. The widow was left in poor circum-
</p>
<p>stances, and she was obliged to do washing and ironing in order to support
</p>
<p>herself and family, a daughter named Elise having been born since her
</p>
<p>marriage.
</p>
<p>Louis, in the course of years, grew strong, robust and muscular. He
</p>
<p>had received a fair education, and, desiring to relieve his mother's burdens
</p>
<p>as much as possible, he learned the carpenter's trade under the tutelage of
</p>
<p>a man named Louis Wuermell in Mannheim. He remained there until
</p>
<p>May 13, 1879, and then, quitting his apprenticeship, proceeded to Kehl, on
</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>the Rhine. There he found employment with a man named Schmidt until
</p>
<p>the fall of 1882. He next went to Freiburg, in the Grand Duchy of Baden,
</p>
<p>where he worked for several contractors. At this place he began to change
</p>
<p>his employment frequently, and his mother, learning of it, wrote several let-
</p>
<p>ters, in which she advised him against such a course and admonished him
</p>
<p>to become a good man, to save his money and keep out of bad company, so
</p>
<p>that he might become useful to himself and to society and make her proud
</p>
<p>of him. But the son did not heed this motherly advice. He fell in with
</p>
<p>free-thinkers who were set against religion in particular and against society
</p>
<p>in general, and soon began reading and absorbing Socialistic literature. It
</p>
<p>was not long before he became an avowed Socialist, attending Socialistic
</p>
<p>meetings and eagerly listening to all the speeches.
</p>
<p>Finally young Lingg grew weary of Baden and wandered to the repub-
</p>
<p>lic of Switzerland. Here he
</p>
<p>spent the fall of 1883 at Lu-
</p>
<p>zerne, working at his trade
</p>
<p>with a man named Rickley,
</p>
<p>but his roving nature soon
</p>
<p>brought him to Zurich.
</p>
<p>It was there that he met
</p>
<p>the famous Anarchist Reins-
</p>
<p>dorf, and for this man he
</p>
<p>speedily formed a warm at-
</p>
<p>tachment. While in Zurich
</p>
<p>Lingg also affiliated with a
</p>
<p>German Socialistic society
</p>
<p>called "Eintracht," and
</p>
<p>threw his whole soul into the
</p>
<p>cause. After a time he turned up at Aarau, but here he was unable
</p>
<p>to find employment and had to write home for assistance. The mother
</p>
<p>loved her son dearly, despite his wanderings, and he did not appeal to
</p>
<p>her in vain. She wrote him enclosing a small sum of money to help him
</p>
<p>bridge over his idleness, and at the same time informed him that she had
</p>
<p>again married (August 6, 1884), her second husband's name being Christian

<p>Gaddum. This man had been a neighbor of the family at Mannheim
</p>
<p>for years. In writing to her son, Mrs. Link indicated that the marriage
</p>
<p>was not prompted by love or admiration, but came about on account
</p>
<p>of her feeble health and her desire to secure support for herself and her
</p>
<p>daughter. Louis' mother had frequently expressed a wish that he visit
</p>
<p>home, but, as the boy had now reached the age for military service under
</p>
<p>the German Government, he concluded to remain away, and in casting
</p>
<p>about for a permanent location he decided to emigrate to America. He
</p>
<p>presented the matter to his mother. At first she opposed it, but finally

</p>
<p>gave her consent. With what money he secured from his mother and from
</p>
<p>his friends, he proceeded to Havre, France, in June, 1885, and boarded a
</p>
<p>steamer for the United States.
</p>
<p>After the wayward boy had left home, he and his mother corresponded
</p>
<p>regularly. She always expressed deep solicitude for his welfare, and when
</p>
<p>he was in financial distress she would write him : " Dear Louis, I will
</p>
<p>share with you as long as I have a bite in the house." All her letters
</p>
<p>breathed encouragement ; she sent money frequently, although at times in
</p>
<p>need herself, and concluded invariably by giving good counsel and urging
</p>
<p>Louis to write her soon and often. When Lingg had arrived in the United
</p>
<p>States the fond mother wrote him that she would soon be able to send him
</p>
<p>money enough to come home on a visit.
</p>
<p>That Lingg had great love and affection for his mother is evidenced by

</p>
<p>the fact that he had carefully preserved all her letters from the time of his
</p>
<p>leaving home until he died a suicide's death. From these letters it appears
</p>
<p>also that Lingg had several lady admirers at home.
</p>
<p>There were many expressions, such as "kindest regards" or " heartiest
</p>
<p>respects," conveyed to him by his mother on behalf of this or that lady
</p>
<p>friend. Another fact made apparent by the letters was that there was some
</p>
<p>great burden on his mind. It would seem that he had plied his mother with
</p>
<p>many questions respecting his birth. That seemed a dark spot in his life.
</p>
<p>He wanted a solution as well as satisfaction. This worried the mother,
</p>
<p>but she always managed to give him some consolation, saying she " would
</p>
<p>guard against everything " and have " all things set right." In one of her
</p>
<p>letters occurs the following :
</p>
<p>As regards your birth, it grieves me that you mention it. While you did not know it
</p>
<p>before, I will now say that you were born in Schwetzingen on the gth day of September,

</p>
<p>father did not want me to marry him because he did not desire me to follow him into Hessia, and
</p>
<p>as he had no real estate he could not marry me in Schwetzingen according to our laws. He
</p>
<p>left and went, I do not know where. If you want a certificate of birth you can get it at
</p>
<p>Schwetzingen any time. If you make a proper presentation everything will be all right, but
</p>
<p>don't hold on six months.
</p>
<p>The original of the above, which is in German and which was found in
</p>
<p>Lingg's trunk, had no signature. Another letter regarding his paternity
</p>
<p>reads as follows, showing that Lingg's mind had been sorely distressed over
</p>
<p>the matter :
</p>
<p>MANNHEIM, June 29, 1884.
</p>
<p>Dear Louis: You must have waited a long time for an answer. John said to Elise
</p>
<p>that I had not yet replied to your last letter. The officials of the court you cannot push.
</p>
<p>For my part I would have been better pleased if they had hurried up, because it would have
</p>
<p>saved you a great deal of time. But now I am glad that it has finally been accomplished.
</p>
<p>After a great deal of toil, I put myself out to go to Schwetzingen and see about the certifi-
</p>
<p>cate of your birth. I know you will be glad and satisfied to learn that you carry the name
</p>
<p>of Lingg. This is better than to have children with two different names. He had you
</p>
<p>entered as a legitimate child before we. got married. I think this was the best course, so
</p>
<p>that you will not worry and reproach me. Such a certificate of birth is no disgrace, and you
</p>
<p>can show it. I felt offended that you took no notice of the "confirmation." Elise had
</p>
<p>everything nice. Her only wish was to receive some small token from Louis, which would
</p>
<p>have pleased her more than anything else. When she came from church, the first thing she
</p>
<p>asked for was as to a letter or card from you, but we had to be contented with the thought
</p>
<p>that perhaps you did not think of us. Now it is all past. ... I was very much troubled
</p>
<p>that it has taken so long [to procure certificate] , but I could not help it. I have kept my
</p>
<p>promise, and you cannot reproach me. Everything is all right, and we are all well and

<p>SCHWETZJNGEN, May 24, 1884. [SEAL.] County Court : CLURICHT.
</p>
<p>To the letter of Mrs. Link, given above, no signature appears, but
</p>
<p>that is not strange. What seems more singular is that. whenever her letters
</p>
<p>were signed, they closed with simply "Your Mother." Another thing
</p>
<p>appears from the above, and that is that at home Louis' name was Link.
</p>
<p>Other documents, some of them legal, also found in his trunk, show that his
</p>
<p>name was formerly written Link. His name must have been changed
</p>
<p>shortly before leaving Europe or just after reaching the United States.
</p>
<p>It would seem that, with such a certificate, Lingg would have been
</p>
<p>measurably happy, but the fact of his illegitimacy, despite court records,
</p>
<p>rankled in his blood. The thought of it haunted him continually, and no
</p>
<p>doubt it helped to make him in religion a free-thinker, in theory a free-
</p>
<p>lover, and in practice an implacable enemy of existing society. His moth-

<p>or nine months before the
</p>
<p>time he succeeded in
</p>
<p>Anarchist circles. No
</p>
<p>when Socialism had
</p>
<p>tached himself was
</p>
<p>er's letters showed that she wished him to be a good man, and it was no
</p>
<p>fault of her early training that he subsequently became an Anarchist. She
</p>
<p>still lives at the old place, and when Lieut. Baus, of the Chicago police
</p>
<p>force, was on a visit to Mannheim, some time ago, he called on her and
</p>
<p>found her very pleasant and affable in her manner, with a strong, robust
</p>
<p>constitution, and still a good-looking woman.
</p>
<p>No sooner had Lingg reached Chicago than he looked up the haunts of
</p>
<p>Socialists and Anarchists. He made their acquaintance, learned the
</p>
<p>strength of the order in the city as well as in the United States, and was
</p>
<p>highly gratified. At that time the organization was not only strong in
</p>
<p>numbers, but it fairly "smelt to heaven" in its rankness of doctrine.
</p>
<p>Lingg was not required to look around very hard for the haunts of Anar-
</p>
<p>chy, for a blind man could plainly see, A. feel and smell the disease in
</p>
<p>the air. Lingg arrived here only eight
</p>
<p>eventful 4th of May, but in that short
</p>
<p>making himself the most popular man in

<p>one had created such a furore since 1872,

</p>
<p>archist. All of them had supplied themselves
</p>
<p>with arms, and a majority of them drilled in
</p>
<p>military tactics. Lingg had not been connected
</p>
<p>with the organization long before he became a
</p>
<p>recognized leader and made speeches that en-
</p>
<p>thused them all. While young in years, they
</p>
<p>recognized in him a worthy leader, and the

<p>fact that he had sat at the very feet of
</p>
<p>Reinsdorf as a pupil elevated him in their
</p>
<p>estimation. This distinction, added to his
</p>
<p>personal magnetism, made him the subject
</p>
<p>for praise and comment, which pleased his vanity and spurred his am-

<p>Men longer in the service and more familiar with the local and general

<p>policy were at stake. No committee was regarded as complete without

<p>him, and this brought him in contact with August Spies and Albert Par-
</p>
<p>sons. He was often at the office of the Arbeiter-Zeitung, which was the
</p>
<p>headquarters of the governing body, with reports and suggestions, and by
</p>
<p>his admirable tact soon won their esteem and good graces. He there also

<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>He was frequently complimented for his work and became quite a favorite
</p>
<p>with the ladies.
</p>
<p>When Lingg first became actively identified with the party of assassi-
</p>
<p>nation and annihilation here, he was cautious and secretive. He knew
</p>
<p>that secrecy in the old country was not only essential to success, but abso-
</p>
<p>lutely requisite for self-preservation. He supposed that the same sort of
</p>
<p>tactics prevailed here, but when he saw how bold, aggressive and open
</p>
<p>were the utterances of the Anarchists in Chicago and elsewhere, he came to
</p>
<p>believe that the government and the municipal administration existed
</p>
<p>simply through their sufferance. At first, whenever Lingg was doubtful on
</p>
<p>any point, he would seek knowledge and inspiration from Spies, and it was
</p>
<p>through Spies
</p>
<p>ment in the
</p>
<p>Lingg implicit-
</p>
<p>looked, as he

</p>
<p>faith, as published for the benefit of capitalists

<p>aires. They were all, in his estimation, stu-

<p>frauds, and existed simply because they printed

</p>
<p>man of sincere convictions and
</p>
<p>earnest zeal, Lingg won the
</p>
<p>confidence of his confreres and
</p>
<p>always knew just what was
</p>
<p>going to be done and how it
</p>
<p>was to be accomplished. He
</p>
<p>was a faithful ally and was
</p>
<p>invariably counted upon to
</p>
<p>take a leading part in all the
</p>
<p>movements of the reds. How
</p>
<p>he was regarded by his fel-
</p>
<p>lows in this respect is shown in the fact that to him was intrusted the task
</p>
<p>of organizing the people of the Southwest Side and directing their plans
</p>
<p>against the McCormick factory.
</p>
<p>His communications, which I have given in a prior chapter, to the
</p>
<p>Bohemians and others in that locality, show that he was bent on riot and
</p>
<p>destruction, and in that mad and frenzied movement he had the hearty
</p>
<p>cooperation of the colleagues who had with him concocted it at the office
</p>
<p>of the Arbeiter-Zeitung. They alone knew of it, and worked out the details

</p>
<p>and more daring than the other leaders, was the chosen instrument to
</p>
<p>inspire the men to an attack upon the works, and he subsequently claimed
</p>
<p>that he had been clubbed by the police during the affray.
</p>
<p>During the turbulent and momentous days preceding May 4, Lingg's
</p>
<p>comrades saddled upon him a great responsibility, but he never flinched.
</p>
<p>On the contrary, he proved the mettle of his make-up, not only volun-
</p>
<p>teering to carry out certain ends he himself outlined, but cheerfully assum-
</p>
<p>ing every task imposed upon him and always willing to take all responsi-
</p>
<p>bility for the consequences. He was found on the North Side actively
</p>
<p>engaged in calling Anarchists to arms, on the Southwest Side endeavor-
</p>
<p>ing to form a compact body of fighters in view of the near approach of
</p>
<p>May i ; he was busy at Seliger's house constructing bombs, and at
</p>
<p>meetings giving instructions how to make infernal machines. His work
</p>
<p>was never finished, and never neglected. At one time he taught his
</p>
<p>followers how to handle the
</p>
<p>bombs so that they would
</p>
<p>not explode in their hands,
</p>
<p>and showed the time and
</p>
<p>distance for throwing the
</p>
<p>missiles with deadly effect;
</p>
<p>at another he drilled those
</p>
<p>who were to do the throw-
</p>
<p>ing, instructing them how
</p>
<p>to surround themselves with
</p>
<p>friends so that detection by
</p>
<p>an enemy would be impos-
</p>
<p>sible.
</p>
<p>All these things kept
</p>
<p>him busy, but his whole
</p>
<p>soul was in the work. He
</p>
<p>was not alone a bomb-maker ; he also constituted himself an agent to sell
</p>
<p>arms. He sold a great many large revolvers and rifles. This is shown
</p>
<p>by a note found in his trunk, addressed to Abraham Hermann. It reads as

</p>
<p>Friend: I sold three revolvers during the last two days, and I will sell three more to-day
</p>
<p>(Wednesday). I sell them from $6.00 to $7.80 apiece.
</p>
<p>Respectfully and best regards, L. LINGG.
</p>
<p>At this time Hermann was the general agent in this city for buying and
</p>
<p>selling arms to the Anarchists. Engel had been an agent at one time, but
</p>
<p>the men claimed that he had fleeced them, and he was dropped.
</p>
<p>Lingg thus proved himself a very useful man to the order. He could
</p>
<p>make an effective speech ; he was a good organizer ; he could make bombs
</p>
<p>with dynamite whose power had been enhanced manifold through his skill ;

</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>he would carry handbills, and he would do anything to help along the cause.
</p>
<p>In truth, he was the shiftiest as well as the most dangerous Anarchist in
</p>
<p>all Chicago.
</p>
<p>Having been a pupil of Reinsdorf, Lingg was an opponent of all peace-
</p>
<p>able agitation. He believed in organizing armed forces and conquering
</p>
<p>everything by main force. He had no love at all for those who talked
</p>
<p>peaceable agitation ; he called them fools and cranks. Of this class were
</p>
<p>the old-time Socialists, and he looked upon them with haughty disdain.
</p>
<p>He found better material to work on for helping him in the revolution he
</p>
<p>proposed, and, although he molded many an Anarchist out of the softer clay
</p>
<p>of humanity, still he was not satisfied, but complained continually that
</p>
<p>they iid not move fast enough, did not take hold with celerity and failed to
</p>
<p>develop such heroic qualities as h^ wished to see. The restless spirit
</p>
<p>within him, his implacable hatred of society, tinged with the bitterness of
</p>
<p>his doubtful birth, t,- d his strong impulses manifested themselves in all his
</p>
<p>acts and utterances. An illustration of these
</p>
<p>traits is the impatience he exhibited over the
</p>
<p>failure of trusted men to come early to the house
</p>
<p>of Seliger to secure bombs on the evening of
</p>
<p>May 4, and his departure with the bombs to
</p>
<p>Neff's Hall to have them speedily distributed.
</p>
<p>Another example is found in the bitter reproaches
</p>
<p>he heaped on those who had failed to carry out
</p>
<p>their part after the inauguration of the Hay-
</p>
<p>market rict. His hopes, his ambitions, had been
</p>
<p>set on the successful consummation of that plot.
</p>
<p>It was to have overthrown all government and
</p>
<p>all law, which he declared were good enough for
</p>
<p>old women to prevent them from quarreling, but needless for men of intel-
</p>
<p>ligence and independence.
</p>
<p>For four weeks prior to the 4th of May he was out of work, but he was
</p>
<p>by no means idle. He worked early and late attending meetings and mak-
</p>
<p>ing bombs, so that, the moment the signal for the general revolution was

</p>
<p>given, every member of the armed sections might be supplied with the
</p>
<p>destructive agent. He wanted the whole city blown up, every capitalist
</p>
<p>wiped off the face of the earth ; and he and his trusted comrades, Sunday
</p>
<p>after Sunday, in anticipation of the uprising, practiced in the suburbs with
</p>
<p>rifles and 44-caliber revolvers. Lingg became the most expert of them all
</p>
<p>and was looked upon by his associates as a crack shot.
</p>
<p>Lingg's money and time were freely given to the purchase of arms and
</p>
<p>to the manufacture of dynamite bombs. His room at Seliger's became a
</p>
<p>veritable arsenal, and, the more deadly "stuff" he brought into the house,
</p>
<p>the more pleased he became, and the more bitter grew the enmity of Mrs.

</p>
<p>Seliger toward him. How careful and elaborate were his preparations for
</p>
<p>the coming day is not only shown by the deadly implements found in his
</p>
<p>room, but is evidenced in the statements of his trusted lieutenants. These
</p>
<p>statements made to me by men anxious to save themselves, prostrate
</p>
<p>suppliants for mercy, whose every material revelation was corroborative
</p>
<p>of the others, although given independently and under different circum-
</p>
<p>stances and without knowledge of what others had said unmistakably
</p>
<p>pointed to a most gigantic conspiracy. Read any of these statements, and
</p>
<p>no doubt can exist that, had it not been for the hand of Providence on the
</p>
<p>night of May 4, thousands of people would have been killed and vast dis-
</p>
<p>tricts of the city laid waste. Lingg expected it as certainly as he believed
</p>
<p>in his own existence at the time, and his intimate comrades bent all their
</p>
<p>energy in the direction of carrying out the villainous plot.
</p>
<p>But "the best laid plans of mice and men gang aft agley," and the
</p>
<p>Haymarket riot proved a most bitter disappointment. Lingg was fairly
</p>
<p>beside himself with chagrin
</p>
<p>and mortification. The one
</p>
<p>consuming desire of his life
</p>
<p>had utterly and signally
</p>
<p>failed of realization. He
</p>
<p>clearly foresaw dire trouble
</p>
<p>in consequence of the at-
</p>
<p>tempt, and his mind was
</p>
<p>bewildered with perplexi-
</p>
<p>ties as to his future move-
</p>
<p>ments. On the night of May
</p>
<p>4, about 11:30 o'clock, when the full truth of the failure of the riot had
</p>
<p>flashed upon him, he stood in front of No. 58 Clybourn Avenue, not knowing
</p>
<p>exactly whither to turn for refuge from possible arrest, and, while in this
</p>
<p>dilemma, he broached the subject to Seliger, finally asking to be permitted
</p>
<p>to remain at the house over night until next morning, when he promised he
</p>
<p>would move away. He was without a cent in his pocket, having squan-
</p>
<p>dered all his money in the manufacture of bombs, confident of plenty when

</p>
<p>he and his fellows had secured control of the city. Seliger, knowing his
</p>
<p>condition, finally consented.
</p>
<p>The next morning came, but Lingg manifested no disposition to carry
</p>
<p>out his promise
</p>
<p>" I would move from here now," said he, very adroitly, "but if I do so it
</p>
<p>would create suspicion."
</p>
<p>Seliger saw the force of the argument, and, being implicated also in the
</p>
<p>manufacture of bombs, shrewdly concluded to let him remain until matters
</p>
<p>quieted down. Lingg accordingly remained until the yth of May. On this
</p>
<p>date officers began to appear in the vicinity, looking into the haunts and
</p>

<p>266 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS,
</p>
<p>resorts of Anarchists. This startled Lingg, and, lest they might pounce
</p>
<p>down upon his room, he decided to speedily vacate the premises. He did
</p>
<p>move, but with such haste that he left his implements of destruction and
</p>
<p>nearly all his personal effects behind him. When the house was finally
</p>
<p>searched the " bird had flown."
</p>
<p>I sent out eight good detectives, and kept them working night and day
</p>
<p>looking for the bomb-maker, but no one could furnish a clue. It was
</p>
<p>learned that Lingg had a sweetheart, and her movements were closely
</p>
<p>watched. The houses of his known friends were also watched, and all his
</p>
<p>acquaintances shadowed. Anarchists who had hopes of saving their own
</p>
<p>necks if he could be found were pressed into the service, and decoy letters
</p>
<p>were sent out. Money was even held out as an inducement to divulge his
</p>
<p>hiding-place, but all to no purpose.
</p>
<p>These expedients were kept up until the i3th of May, when I sent for
</p>
<p>Mrs. Seliger to ascertain where Lingg had last been employed and secure
</p>
<p>the addresses of all his friends. Nearly all the places she mentioned had
</p>
<p>been visited, but she spoke of one place that seemed to me to hold out
</p>
<p>some promise of a successful result. Mrs. Seliger stated that there was a
</p>
<p>place near the river, where there was a bridge that she had beard spoken
</p>
<p>of, and that Lingg had said to her husband that he would call on a friend
</p>
<p>of his near that place, on Canal Street. This place I at once recognized
</p>
<p>as being only a few blocks from the shop where Lingg had worked. Mrs.
</p>
<p>Seliger further stated that her husband had told her that this shop was only
</p>
<p>a few blocks from a Catholic church. All this I regarded as a good clue,
</p>
<p>and Officers Loewenstein and Schuettler were promptly detailed to follow it
</p>
<p>up first going, however, to a planing-mill on Twelfth and South Clark
</p>
<p>Streets to ascertain if Lingg had ever worked there.
</p>
<p>The officers carried out these instructions, and a few hours later they
</p>
<p>returned to the office, their faces wreathed in smiles. They informed me
</p>
<p>that they had secured a clue, that only a few days before Lingg had sent
</p>
<p>there for his tool chest, and that they had learned of a man who had noticed
</p>
<p>the number of the express wagon that had carted it away. But this man,
</p>
<p>they said, they would be unable to see until the next day.
</p>
<p>Bright and early the next morning the officers started out with new

<p>instructions and visited the house of the person who had so singularly taken
</p>
<p>note of the express number. They found him, and he gave them all the
</p>
<p>information he possessed. About eleven o'clock the officers found the resi-
</p>
<p>dence of the expressman, whose name was Charles Keperson and whose
</p>
<p>wagon was numbered 1,999. He lived at No. 1095 Robey Street. The
</p>
<p>officers rapped on the door, and a little girl about ten years of age answered.
</p>
<p>On being asked after her father she informed them that he was not at home.
</p>
<p>They inquired if her father had not brought in a trunk. She replied that
</p>
<p>her father had brought no trunk into their house, but he had hauled a tool
</p>
<p>A DESPERATE STRUGGLE. 267
</p>
<p>chest from down town, which he had taken to a house on an adjoining
</p>
<p>street. She pointed out a little cottage at No. 80 Ambrose Street, and on
</p>
<p>being asked if she had seen her father take it there she answered :
</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, it was a gray-colored box, and I heard my father say it
</p>
<p>belonged to Louis Lingg."
</p>
<p>The officers went over to the cottage and learned that a family named
</p>
<p>Klein lived there. Schuettler knocked on the door, and Mrs. Klein responded.
</p>
<p>He asked if Louis was at home. She replied that he was not and that he
</p>
<p>had gone out with some gentlemen about nine o'clock. She inquired what
</p>
<p>he desired to see Louis for, and Schuettler told her that he owed Louis $3
</p>
<p>and had come to pay him. He further informed her that they were good
</p>
<p>friends, both carpenters, and belonged to the same union. She inquired
</p>
<p>after his name, and Schuettler responded that it was "Franz Lorenz. "
</p>
<p>Lorenz was a well known Anarchist, and it was thought the name would
</p>
<p>prove effective in winning the woman's confidence. She said that her
</p>
<p>father lived only a short distance from the house, and she would step over
</p>
<p>and ask him if he knew where Louis had gone. This conversation had
</p>
<p>taken place in a rear
</p>
<p>room of the house. The

<p>woman excused herself,
</p>
<p>and ostensibly started J3UOK"W - :^r LINGG'S REVOLVER.

<p>returned, and he had hardly joined Schuettler when Mrs. Klein stepped in.

<p>Lingg some other time.
</p>
<p>After leaving, the officers walked for two blocks and talked over the mys-
</p>
<p>terious actions of Mrs. Klein. They concluded to go back and search the
</p>
<p>house. They secured entrance from the rear, and, while Loewenstein
</p>
<p>guarded the front door, Schuettler entered the rear room. There he found
</p>
<p>a man smoothly shaven. Lingg had been described as having chin whis-
</p>
<p>kers. Schuettler stepped up to the man, however, and asked his name.
</p>
<p>In an instant Lingg for it was none other whipped out a 44-caliber
</p>
<p>revolver, which he had had concealed in front inside his trousers, and, with
</p>
<p>the glare of a tiger held at bay, he turned on the officer. Schuettler saw the
</p>
<p>movement, and, quick as a flash, sprang on Lingg and seized the weapon.
</p>
<p>268 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>They clinched, and while the one was struggling to save himself and secure
</p>
<p>his prisoner, the other was bent upon killing the officer and effecting his own
</p>
<p>escape. Both were strong, muscular and active, and the cottage shook
</p>
<p>from foundation to rafters as the bodies of the contestants swayed in the
</p>
<p>equal contest. Lingg quivered with rage and aroused himself to his utmost
</p>
<p>to vanquish the foe. He realized that the result meant life or death. At
</p>
<p>one moment his revolver was pressed close to the officer's breast, and with
</p>
<p>a superhuman effort the Anarchist tried to send a bullet on its fatal mission.
</p>
<p>But Schuettler had a firm grasp of the cylinder and wrenched the weapon
</p>
<p>aside. In another second, while the mastery was still undecided, Lingg, by
</p>
<p>a quick movement of his hand, brought the revolver square into the officer's
</p>
<p>face. At that moment, however, Schuettler managed to get Lingg's thumb
</p>
<p>between his teeth. The Anarchist made a sudden dash to release his thumb
</p>
<p>and succeeded in breaking loose.
</p>
<p>All this took place in less time than it takes to tell it. The moment
</p>
<p>Lingg was foot-loose, Schuettler found time to shout for his companion,
</p>
<p>who had stood on the outside in front of the house, all unconscious of the
</p>
<p>short but desperate struggle within. Loewenstein did not stop a moment
</p>
<p>to determine what was wanted, but sprang into the room. He entered just
</p>
<p>at the moment when Schuettler had bounded after Lingg on his release and
</p>
<p>found him holding Lingg tightly by the throat with one hand and the
</p>
<p>revolver with the other. Loewenstein saw the situation at a glance, and,
</p>
<p>raising his loaded cane, brought it down on the Anarchist's head. This
</p>
<p>stunned Lingg, and he was overpowered. The revolver was wrenched from
</p>
<p>his hand and placed on a table, and the officers adjusted the handcuffs.
</p>
<p>These had no sooner been placed in position than Lingg made a sudden
</p>
<p>dash for his revolver. But the detectives were too quick for him.
</p>
<p>Lingg's teeth gnashed with rage, and his eyes fairly bulged from their
</p>
<p>sockets with savage scorn. The arch-Anarchist looked the picture of des-
</p>
<p>peration. He had been vanquished, however, and he saw that further
</p>
<p>resistance was useless.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Klein had meanwhile been an excited spectator, but before she
</p>
<p>could collect her thoughts and decide what course to take under the circum-
</p>
<p>stances, Lingg was in the power of the law. Seeing this, she hurried out.

<p>It was not long before the whole neighborhood heard of what had happened,
</p>
<p>and, as the officers started to take their prisoner to the Hinman Street Sta-
</p>
<p>tion, a true-hearted Irish-American came up, accosted them and said :
</p>
<p>" My dear boys, your lives are in danger here. Nearly every one who
</p>
<p>lives about here is an Anarchist. Wait for a minute, and I will give you
</p>
<p>protection."
</p>
<p>He disappeared, but meanwhile the street had become crowded with an
</p>
<p>excited populace. He soon returned with a double-barreled shot-gun, ready
</p>
<p>for action in case of emergency. No sooner had he placed himself at the

<p>A DESPERATE STRUGGLE. Louis LINGO'S ARREST.

</p>
<p>disposal of the officers than a loyal Bohemian-American came running
</p>
<p>across the street, and said :
</p>
<p>"Officers, I will also protect you against this mob."
</p>
<p>He had in his hand a large navy revolver, and he showed that he was
</p>
<p>ready to assist the officers, even at the cost of his own life.
</p>
<p>Schuettler and Loewenstein, under this volunteer escort, marched Lingg
</p>
<p>to the Hinman Street Station, reaching there about twelve o'clock. Ser-
</p>
<p>geant Enwright was in charge of the station that day, and, lest any attempt
</p>
<p>at rescue might be made, he called in all his officers and gave them
</p>
<p>instructions as to what should be done to protect the station. He also
</p>
<p>ordered out the patrol wagon, and detailed five officers to accompany
</p>
<p>Schuettler and Loewenstein to the Klein residence to investigate the prem-
</p>
<p>ises. They made a thorough search, but could discover nothing except a
</p>
<p>lot of cartridges. They also investigated the houses at Nos. 64, 66, 68 and
</p>
<p>70 on the same street, all occupied by Anarchists, but they found nothing.
</p>
<p>The presence of the police, however, speedily cleared the street, and all the
</p>
<p>low-browed, shaggy-haired followers of the red flag hunted their holes.
</p>
<p>Schuettler and Loewenstein then sent for the Chicago Avenue patrol wagon
</p>
<p>and transferred Lingg to new quarters at that station. On the way Lingg con-
</p>
<p>tinually ground his teeth, and, looking savagely at Schuettler and turning
</p>
<p>slightly towards Loewenstein, hissed out :
</p>
<p>" If I had only got half a chance at that fellow, he would be a dead man
</p>
<p>now. "
</p>
<p>The officers of the Hinman Street Station did not relax their vigilance
</p>
<p>over Ambrose Street, and one day some molds made of clay were found in
</p>
<p>the alley in the rear of the Klein residence, proving that Lingg had not
</p>
<p>abandoned hope, but was getting ready to prepare a new supply of bombs
</p>
<p>for a future attack.
</p>
<p>When Lingg had been ushered into the office of the East Chicago Avenue
</p>
<p>Station, the shackles were removed from his wrists, and he was given a
</p>
<p>chair. He became quiet in his new surroundings, and grudgingly answered
</p>
<p>a few simple questions. His thumb giving him considerable pain, some
</p>
<p>liniment was procured from a neighboring drug store, and the wound dressed.
</p>
<p>He was then assigned to an apartment below, and left to his own thoughts.

</p>
<p>In the afternoon he was brought up to the office.
</p>
<p>"What is your name?" I asked him.
</p>
<p>" Lingg," curtly replied the prisoner.
</p>
<p>' ' Ah, yes ; but how do you spell it ? "
</p>
<p>"L-i-n-gg," came the spelling.
</p>
<p>"Yes ; but give us your full name."
</p>
<p>" It is Louis or Ludwig Lingg. I am twenty-one years and eight
</p>
<p>months old."
</p>
<p>He was asked a great many questions. Some he refused to answer, and
</p>
<p>LINGG IN THE TOILS. 271
</p>
<p>others he answered promptly and with pleasure, especially when they
</p>
<p>touched on killing capitalists and capitalistic editors, as he called them. He
</p>
<p>had no use, he said, for these people, and thought that if they could be
</p>
<p>taken away suddenly the world would be satisfied and happy. He remarked
</p>
<p>that he did not blame the police very much, because they were workingmen
</p>
<p>themselves, but there v/as one officer, he said, that he perfectly despised.
</p>
<p>It was John Bonfield. If he could have blown him to atoms, he thought,
</p>
<p>he might become reconciled to a great many things as they then existed.
</p>
<p>He finally gave to me and to Assistant State's Attorney Furthmann, in the
</p>
<p>presence of Officers Stift, Rehm, Loewenstein, Schuettler and Hoffman, a
</p>
<p>brief account of himself and his movements, but he said that he would
</p>
<p>rather die than give information against any one. He did not deny
</p>
<p>what others had stated about him, but further he would not go. He was
</p>
<p>informed by Mr. Furthmann how strict the law was against conspiracies,
</p>
<p>but the only answer he vouchsafed was that the laws would not remain in
</p>
<p>force much longer ; that the working people would make laws to suit them-
</p>
<p>selves, and they would not allow any higher power to dictate to them. For
</p>
<p>IRON BOLT FOUND IN LINGO'S TRUNK. From a Photograph.
</p>
<p>Designed, according to Lingg's own statement, to connect the halves of a composition bomb weighing
</p>
<p>twelve pounds. "The Haymarket bomb," said he, "killed six. The one which I was going to make with
</p>
<p>that bolt would kill six dozen." Four such bolts were found.
</p>
<p>his own part, he could work and was willing to work, he said, but he wanted
</p>
<p>his share of the profits. He thought the police had made fools of them-
</p>
<p>selves in the movement the Anarchists had inaugurated. If they had only
</p>
<p>known enough, he said, to have held back, the capitalists would have been
</p>
<p>forced to submit ; but now the police had spoiled their own chances for gain
</p>
<p>for years to come. They would be sorry for it, he added. If the Anarchists
</p>
<p>had won in Chicago, he further stated, all the other large cities would have
</p>
<p>fallen into line, and wretchedness and poverty would have been banished
</p>
<p>forever.
</p>
<p>After Lingg had been taken away from the Ambrose Street house, Gus-
</p>
<p>tav and Kate Klein became anxious about their friend. They traced him
</p>
<p>to the Chicago Avenue Station and called there later in the day, after
</p>
<p>his arrest. When they reached the office I questioned them, although they

</p>
<p>were not under arrest, and they answered without hesitancy. They stated
</p>
<p>that Lingg had come to their house on the yth of May, and had remained
</p>
<p>indoors nearly all the time up to his arrest that day May 14. He had
</p>
<p>only been out twice to secure books from some neighbors, and he had felt
</p>
<p>measurably safe in the locality. This section, it was found, as already
</p>
<p>272 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>stated, was a hotbed of Anarchy, and as the neighbors knew the man, they
</p>
<p>were anxious to protect him. It had even been whispered in the locality
</p>
<p>that he was the one who had thrown the bomb at the Haymarket, but,
</p>
<p>knowing that he was a man not to be trifled with, and out of sympathy for
</p>
<p>the cause, none would betray him. He could not have selected a better
</p>
<p>place for concealment. Mr. Klein had known him for some time and had
</p>
<p>noticed a great change in him since the Haymarket bloodshed.
</p>
<p>" He was always cheerful," he said, "up to that time, but since then he
</p>
<p>acted very strangely. He would not converse with any one, but always
</p>
<p>sought to be alone. Whenever any one came near the house he was
</p>
<p>uneasy."
</p>
<p>"I noticed that too," interposed Mrs. Klein. "He always used to fool
</p>
<p>and play with me before the Haymarket event, and was good company,
</p>
<p>but since then he was a changed man altogether."
</p>
<p>Mrs. Klein described the scene of Lingg's arrest, and told how at first
</p>
<p>she had regarded it simply as fun between two friends, and how frightened she
</p>
<p>had become when she discovered that it was a serious affair. She also
</p>
<p>described the terrible look which came over Lingg's face when he found him-
</p>
<p>self powerless to fire the revolver.
</p>
<p>I subsequently thought it best to bring Lingg face to face with one of
</p>
<p>his former comrades, who had furnished information about him, and this
</p>
<p>was accordingly done. The moment he was brought into the presence of
</p>
<p>the informer his face assumed a terrible scowl, but he remained obstinately
</p>
<p>silent.
</p>
<p>One day Lingg was again brought into the office, and I questioned him
</p>
<p>as to the real strength of the Anarchists in the city and country.
</p>
<p>He smiled and said :
</p>
<p>" Don't you know that yet ? This I cannot answer, but I will tell you
</p>
<p>that you only know the noisy fellows. The real Anarchists in this city or
</p>
<p>country you do not know yet, because they are not ready to take hold, but
</p>
<p>you will be taken by surprise unless you die soon. I only hope that I will
</p>
<p>live long enough to see this hidden power show its strength."
</p>
<p>During the time Lingg remained at the station his hand was regularly
</p>
<p>attended to, he was treated very kindly, had plenty to eat, and was made as

</p>
<p>comfortable as possible. All these attentions somewhat mollified his bitter-
</p>
<p>ness against us.
</p>
<p>Some time after the other interviews, I visited him and asked him if he
</p>
<p>entertained any hostility towards the police. He replied that during the
</p>
<p>McCormick factory riot he had been clubbed by an officer, but he did not
</p>
<p>care so much for that. He could forget it all, but he did not like Bonfield.
</p>
<p>If it had not been for Bonfield, he said, the street-car men, in their strike
</p>
<p>in the summer of 1885, would have had things all their own way, and that
</p>
<p>would have changed everything all over the city in a business way.
</p>
<p>THE BOMB-MAKER IN JAIL. 273
</p>
<p>" If I could only kill Bonfield, " he vehemently declared, "I would be
</p>
<p>ready to die within five minutes afterwards."
</p>
<p>Lingg was a singular Anarchist. In every act and word he showed no
</p>
<p>care for himself, but he always expressed sympathy for men who had ip.vni-
</p>
<p>lies and who were in trouble. He showed that he was a man with a will,
</p>
<p>and that if he set his mind to the accomplishment of an end he would bei.d
</p>
<p>all his energies to attain it.
</p>
<p>There was another peculiarity about Lingg which distinguished him
</p>
<p>from the rest of his associates. Although he drank beer, he never drank to
</p>
<p>excess, and he frowned upon the use of bad or indecent language. He
</p>
<p>was an admirer of the fair sex, and they reciprocated his admiration, his
</p>
<p>manly form, handsome face and pleasing manners captivating all.
</p>
<p>On the ayth of May, Lingg and Engel were taken in a patrol wagon to
</p>
<p>the Harrison Street Station, where the "art gallery" of the Police Depart-
</p>
<p>ment was kept, to have their photographs taken. On the way, Loewen-
</p>
<p>stein remarked to Lingg :
</p>
<p>" Louis, you want to look your prettiest, so that you will make a good
</p>
<p>picture."
</p>
<p>" What difference does it make whether a dead man's picture looks good
</p>
<p>or bad," was the reply, uttered in a most serious manner and in a strong
</p>
<p>tone of voice.
</p>
<p>From the gallery the Anarchists were driven to the County Jail, and
</p>
<p>that was the last time they ever saw the streets of Chicago or breathed the
</p>
<p>.air outside of prison walls.
</p>
<p>From the day Lingg entered the jail he became surly and ugly to all the
</p>
<p>officers, but he implicitly obeyed all prison rules. He held himself aloof
</p>
<p>from everybody except his fellow Anarchists, and would have nothing to say
</p>
<p>to any one except his friends or his sweetheart.
</p>
<p>Lingg was very fond of children, and when those of Neebe, Schwab or
</p>
<p>others called at the jail he would play with them and seemed to extract
</p>
<p>much amusement from their little pranks and antics.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Klein often visited him and always brought a baby, in which Lingg
</p>
<p>seemed to take a special interest. Lingg and Mrs. Klein conversed freely
</p>
<p>together, and he seemed to enjoy her visits greatly. Whenever she called

</p>
<p>she brought him fruit of the season and choice edibles with which to vary
</p>
<p>his prison fare.
</p>
<p>Lingg and his associates proved quite a drawing card, and Anarchists
</p>
<p>from all parts of the country called at the jail. But while his fellows
</p>
<p>appeared pleased to hold receptions, so to speak, Lingg did not desire the
</p>
<p>company of strangers. He gave his time only to the few ladies who called
</p>
<p>on him and to his nearest friends. He disliked being gaped at by curiosity-
</p>
<p>seekers, and when he had no good friend to keep him company he traveled
</p>
<p>the corridors of the jail beyond the reach of public gaze. He also whiled
</p>
<p>274
</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS,
</p>
<p>time away by cutting pretty little carvings out of cigar-boxes with his jack-
</p>
<p>knife, and in this he displayed considerable ingenuity. Tiring of this
</p>
<p>diversion, he would pick up a book or a paper ; but, however monotonous
</p>
<p>prison life at times became, he never thrust himself before the visitors' cage
</p>
<p>to pose before the idle throng. Many callers came to sympathize with
</p>
<p>Lingg as well as to admire his handsome physique, and, as he would not
</p>
<p>allow his hair to be cut after his incarceration, his flowing, curly locks added
</p>
<p>to his picturesque appearance.
</p>
<p>But there was one visitor he always welcomed. It was his sweetheart,
</p>
<p>whose acquaintance he had made before his arrest, and who became a reg-
</p>
<p>ular caller. She invariably wore a pleasant smile, breathed soft, loving
</p>
<p>words into his ears through the wire
</p>
<p>screen that separated the visitors' cage
</p>
<p>from the jail corridor, and contributed
</p>
<p>much toward keeping him cheerful.
</p>
<p>This girl had lived at one time with
</p>
<p>a family on West Lake Street, in the
</p>
<p>heart of an Anarchist camp, but, for
</p>
<p>some reason, while her lover was at the
</p>
<p>Chicago Avenue Station she never paid
</p>
<p>him a visit. The second day after he
</p>
<p>had been locked up at the County Jail
</p>
<p>she promptly made her appearance,
</p>
<p>however, and became a regular visitor.
</p>
<p>She simply passed with the jail officials
</p>
<p>at first as "Lingg's girl," but one day
</p>
<p>some one called her Ida Miller, and
</p>
<p>thereafter she was recognized under
</p>
<p>that name. She was generally accom-
</p>
<p>panied by young Miss Engel, the
</p>
<p>daughter of Anarchist Engel, and during the last four months of her lover's
</p>
<p>incarceration she could be seen every afternoon entering the jail. She was
</p>
<p>always readily admitted until the day the bombs were found in Lingg's cell.

</p>
<p>After that neither she nor Mr. and Mrs. Klein were admitted. While it has
</p>
<p>never been satisfactorily proven who it was that introduced the bombs into
</p>
<p>the jail, it is likely that they were smuggled into Lingg's hands by his sweet-
</p>
<p>heart. She enjoyed Lingg's fullest confidence, and regarded his every wish.
</p>
<p>It is not known whether Miller is the real name of the girl, but it
</p>
<p>is supposed to be Elise Friedel. She is a German, and was twenty-two
</p>
<p>years of age at the time, her birthplace being Mannheim, which was also
</p>
<p>Lingg's native town. She was robust in appearance, with fair complexion,
</p>
<p>and dark hair. She had quite a penchant for beer, and could sit in a crowd
</p>
<p>of her Anarchist friends and drink "schnitts" with the proficiency of a vet-

</p>
<p>eran. She always entertained hope of executive clemency, but when Lingg
</p>
<p>died at his own hands she somewhat surprisingly failed to evince great sor-
</p>
<p>row. Perhaps the consciousness of having aided him in escaping the gal-
</p>
<p>lows had prepared her for the worst.
</p>
<p>Lingg's terrible death did not perceptibly change her demeanor. She
</p>
<p>was seen at several dances shortly afterwards, and seemed to enjoy herself
</p>
<p>as much as anybody. She even danced with detectives, unconscious of
</p>
<p>their calling, and, in jesting with them, her laugh was as hearty and ringing
</p>
<p>as though she were bent on capturing a new beau.
</p>
<p>During all the long, weary days Lingg remained in jail his demeanor was
</p>
<p>the same as during the trial cool, collected and unconcerned. No special
</p>
<p>trouble apparently burdened his mind. His constant companions when-
</p>
<p>ever they were permitted to be together were Engel and Fischer. They
</p>
<p>appeared to believe that their fellow prisoners and co-conspirators would
</p>
<p>turn on them to save their own lives.
</p>
<p>The statement Lingg made, on the I4th of May, omitting the part per-
</p>
<p>taining to his occupation, age and residence, was as follows :
</p>
<p>"Whenever I did any work at home [Seliger's house] I did it as care-
</p>
<p>fully as possible, so that no one could see me. I did make dynamite bombs
</p>
<p>out of gas-pipe, and I generally found the gas-pipe on the street. Finding
</p>
<p>them two or three feet long, I would cut them into pieces. After cutting
</p>
<p>them about six inches long I would fill them with dynamite and attach a
</p>
<p>fuse to each. I then would call them bombs."
</p>
<p>"Who showed or taught you how to make those bombs?"
</p>
<p>"No one. I learned it from books."
</p>
<p>"What books?"
</p>
<p>"I read it in a book published by Herr Most of New York. It explains
</p>
<p>how to make dynamite and other articles used in war. I once had four
</p>
<p>bombs in my dinner-box two were loaded and two empty. I bought two
</p>
<p>pounds of the stuff on Lake Street, near Dearborn. I also bought one coil
</p>
<p>of fuse and one box of caps at the same place, and that is all I bought. I
</p>
<p>paid 65 cents for the box of caps, 60 cents for two pounds of dynamite, and
</p>
<p>50 cents for the coil of fuse."
</p>
<p>" Did you work all the material into the bombs? "

<p>"No, there is some of it left in my trunk. I do not deny making bombs.
</p>
<p>I made them for the purpose of being used in a war or a revolution during
</p>
<p>these workingmen's troubles. The bombs found in my room I intended to
</p>
<p>use myself. I have been at August Spies' office several times, and I have
</p>
<p>known him for some time. I always received the Arbeiter-Zeitung, and I
</p>
<p>like to read it. I made some of those round lead bombs. I made the
</p>
<p>molds myself and cast the bombs. The iron bolts I used to connect and
</p>
<p>hold them together I bought in a hardware store. 1 bought five small ones
</p>
<p>and two big ones. I could only use the molds to cast bombs with a few
</p>
<p>times ; then they would be useless. At the time I bought the dynamite I
</p>
<p>was alone. On Tuesday night, May 4, Seliger and I were on Larrabee
</p>
<p>Street, between Clybourn Avenue and the city limits, and we remained
</p>
<p>there until about ten o'clock. We then went home and had several glasses
</p>
<p>of beer. We did not meet any one we knew. We were on Larrabee
</p>

</p>
<p>Street all the time. When we came home Mrs. Seliger was abed. I was
</p>
<p>at the meeting held in the hall at No. 71 West Lake Street, Monday night,
</p>
<p>May 3. I saw there the circular which called the workingmen to arms and
</p>
<p>to seek revenge on the police because they had killed six of our brothers
</p>
<p>at McCormick's factory on that day. I also attended a meeting the same
</p>
<p>night, at No. 54 West Lake Street, which was held by the armed sections.
</p>
<p>I was out to Lake View and tried one of my dynamite bombs to find out
</p>
<p>what strength it had. I put the bomb in a tree between two limbs. I lit
</p>
<p>the fuse ; the bomb exploded and split the tree, damaging it considerably. I
</p>
<p>had my hair cut, and mustache and whiskers shaven off, about May 8th or
</p>
<p>gth. I want to say right here to you men that I did make dynamite bombs
</p>
<p>and intended to use them. I am down on capital and capitalists. I knew
</p>
<p>that if we sought our rights I mean the workingmen they would turn out
</p>
<p>the police and militia against us with their Gatling guns and cannon. We
</p>
<p>knew that we could not defend ourselves with our revolvers, and therefore
</p>
<p>turned to the adoption of
</p>
<p>dynamite. For one, I was
</p>
<p>not going to get hurt. I
</p>
<p>made bombs of lead and
</p>
<p>bombs of metal, and I made
</p>
<p>them with the two materials
</p>
<p>mixed. I tried both the lead
</p>
<p>and gas-pipe bombs, and I
</p>
<p>found that they could do
</p>
<p>good service. If you cut the
</p>
<p>fuse ten inches long and light
</p>
<p>it you can run away forty
</p>
<p>steps before the explosion
</p>
<p>takes place. The armed men
</p>
<p>of the so-called International
</p>
<p>Group of the North Side
</p>
<p>always met at Greif's Hall,

<p>We used to go to the Shoot-
</p>
<p>ing Park in Lake View and
</p>
<p>shoot at targets on Sundays.
</p>
<p>I have been there about ten times. I admit that the two Lehmans came
</p>
<p>to see me at my room at No. 442 Sedgwick Street, and I will confess that
</p>
<p>on Tuesday, May 4, six men came to my room to see me."
</p>
<p>At this interview there were present, besides myself, Furthmann, Stift,
</p>
<p>Rehm, Loewenstein, Schuettler and Hoffman. On the i7th of May, Lingg
</p>
<p>again remarked to Officer Schuettler that he regretted that he had not had
</p>
<p>a chance to kill him.
</p>
<p>On the 24th of May Lingg and Hubner were brought together, and
</p>
<p>Assistant State's Attorney Furthmann asked the latter if he knew the
</p>
<p>bomb-maker.
</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I was at his room on Tuesday afternoon, May 4, helping him
</p>
<p>to make dynamite bombs, and what I stated in my affidavit is true."
</p>
<p>Lingg scowled furiously, and emphatically denied the statement. All

</p>
<p>he could be made to say in explanation of the affair, however, was that he
</p>
<p>"had been a Socialist all his life and ever since he could think."
</p>
<p>ERNST HUBNER was arrested by Officers Schuettler and Whalen on
</p>
<p>the morning of May 18, at six o'clock, while he was on his way to his
</p>
<p>work. He is a German by birth and a carpenter by trade, and worked
</p>
<p>for a man by the name of Schombel, on the corner of Clybourn Avenue and
</p>
<p>Larrabee Street. He was about forty years of age, married, wore very
</p>
<p>shabby clothes, and lived, at the time of his arrest, at No. n Mohawk
</p>
<p>Street, in three small and dirty rooms. His house was searched, and the
</p>
<p>officers found one breech-loading rifle, one large 44-caliber Remington
</p>
<p>revolver and half a pailful of ammunition for both guns. While they
</p>
<p>were searching the house, Mrs. Hubner, a sickly, delicate woman, said to
</p>
<p>Officer Schuettler :
</p>
<p>"My dear man, if my husband had gone more to his shop and to work
</p>
<p>instead of running to meetings, you would not find my house in this shape.
</p>
<p>I am all broken up. I am sick, and now he is arrested. I suppose this is
</p>
<p>the last of our family."
</p>
<p>The search still going on, Mrs. Hubner crossed the room to a closet,
</p>
<p>saying to Schuettler :
</p>
<p>" Here, officers, take this devil's print out of my house. This is what
</p>
<p>my husband prayed with night and day, and what got him into trouble. If
</p>
<p>you don't want to take it, I will throw it into the stove. I don't want any
</p>
<p>more families made miserable by it."
</p>
<p>The officer opened the bundle, and the first thing he saw was a picture
</p>
<p>of the burly face of John Most. This led to the exchange of a few pleas-
</p>
<p>antries between the officers.
</p>
<p>"I have got him," shouted Schuettler.
</p>
<p>When Officer Whalen got a glimpse of the portrait, which was printed
</p>
<p>on the cover of a pamphlet, and not knowing what the title on the cover
</p>
<p>had reference to, as it was printed in German, or whom the picture repre-
</p>
<p>sented, he facetiously remarked :
</p>
<p>"I see the face of a Scotch terrier."
</p>
<p>"You fool," replied Schuettler, with a twinkle in his eye, "that is
</p>
<p>Johann Most."

</p>
<p>"Well," retorted Whalen, "if that is the great Anarchist, he ought to
</p>
<p>have two more legs. He'd make a fine ratter."
</p>
<p>In the bundle were found a number of Communistic, Socialistic and
</p>
<p>Anarchistic documents, and a complete collection of hand-bills of all
</p>
<p>the meetings that had been held for years past. Hubner had been an
</p>
<p>active worker at all times. He would post bills, carry hand-bills and do
</p>
<p>any kind of work for the "good of the cause." No meetings were ever
</p>
<p>held too far from his home. He was well known in all the "groups" and
</p>
<p>to all the leaders. He attended all the picnics and parades. Nothing
</p>
<p>278 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>delighted him more than to carry the big banner belonging to the Interna-
</p>
<p>tional Carpenters' Union No. i. How he strutted and flaunted that banner
</p>
<p>as he passed churches, police stations and the residences of the wealthy.
</p>
<p>Next to Host's book, that banner was his principal source of inspiration.
</p>
<p>He would even neglect his meals for the sake of bearing aloft that crimson
</p>
<p>standard. Whether this was the cause of his emaciated look at the time
</p>
<p>of his arrest is problematical, but certain it is his appearance, when
</p>
<p>brought before me, indicated want and starvation, and his voice was weak
</p>
<p>and husky.
</p>
<p>" From what I can hear about you," I said, " it appears that you are
</p>
<p>one of the ' boys.' "
</p>
<p>"Oh, well," drawled Hubner, "you may hear a great deal."
</p>
<p>"Yes,'' I replied, " I hear so much it keeps me busy thinking."
</p>
<p>"Have you been thinking any of me ?" queried Hubner.
</p>
<p>"I have, and I think you are the worst I have heard of yet.' 1
</p>
<p>"Ah, but you have got others far more dangerous than I am."
</p>
<p>"If you want to give credit to any one else, name the parties."
</p>
<p>Hubner finally stated that only on the evening previous, at a meeting of
</p>
<p>the Carpenters' Union, a member had said that their attorneys, Messrs.
</p>
<p>Salomon & Zeisler, held that there was no law to convict any one, and that
</p>
<p>they would secure the release of the "boys" as fast as the police locked
</p>
<p>them up. They advised all to " keep their mouths shut," and that, in the
</p>
<p>event of an arrest, the police could not hold them longer than two days.
</p>
<p>" Do you want to try that and see how it works ? " I asked.
</p>
<p>"That's what I want," responded Hubner, bent on an experiment.
</p>
<p>"Well, I guarantee you," said I smilingly, "that you will remain here
</p>
<p>with us as long as we like your company. When we get tired of you we
</p>
<p>will send you to the big jail. Officer, take this man and tell the lockup-
</p>
<p>keeper that he will probably stay with us a week."
</p>
<p>Hubner was escorted.down stairs, given a good cell and allowed to met-
</p>
<p>aphorically wrap "that banner" around him as he lay down to dream of
</p>
<p>Anarchy. Things got monotonous, however. The very next day he sent
</p>
<p>word that he desired to see me. He was brought up and made a long
</p>
<p>statement. He assured me that every word was true, that he would face

</p>
<p>any of those mentioned and defy them to contradict his assertions. He
</p>
<p>told the day and date of almost every transaction. He said he would
</p>
<p>swear to everything he had stated.
</p>
<p>" I don't believe in a God," he added, " but when I swear, I understand
</p>
<p>that if I should tell a lie or an untruth I can be punished for it. I am dis-
</p>
<p>gusted with the way things are now. There are no more brave men."
</p>
<p>After a few days he was released by order of the State's Attorney.
</p>
<p>Before leaving, he promised that he would testify in court in accordance
</p>
<p>with his statement, and afterwards, for a time, he was on hand whenever
</p>
<p>sent for.
</p>
<p>ERNST HUBNER S CONFESSIONS. 279
</p>
<p>The parties arrested were required to report regularly. At the com-
</p>
<p>mencement of the trial, they were all kept in a large room in the station,
</p>
<p>where ten officers guarded them night and day. They were taken out for
</p>
<p>exercise every evening, but were not allowed to talk to any one. Their
</p>
<p>wives had the privilege of seeing them, but an officer was always present to
</p>
<p>hear what was said.
</p>
<p>Hubner after a time showed signs of weakening. He had been seen by
</p>
<p>the attorneys for the defense and changed his mind. He also began talk-
</p>
<p>ing to others, urging them not to testify. He finally said he would not
</p>
<p>take the stand, and, as he was not wanted to testify, he was again released.
</p>
<p>After the trial he went back to his comrades, attended some of their
</p>
<p>meetings and talked for the cause. When the time approached for the
</p>
<p>execution, he suddenly left the city, and subsequently sent for his family.
</p>
<p>He has returned to Chicago, however, and is working on Division and
</p>
<p>Clark Streets, in a little carpenter-shop.
</p>
<p>The following is his statement, to the correctness of which he would
</p>
<p>have testified had he not been a poltroon and a simpleton. It fully bears
</p>
<p>out the truth of the witnesses who appeared for the State during 'the trial
</p>
<p>as to the conspiracy and the parties thereto :
</p>
<p>" I know Gottfried Waller. I belong to the armed men. I know George
</p>
<p>Engel. At one time he published a paper called the Anarchist. I know
</p>
<p>Louis Lingg. I was a Greif's Hall, 54 West Lake Street, Monday after-
</p>
<p>noon about five o'clock. I left there at nine o'clock and got home at eleven
</p>
<p>the same night. I read and saw a circular that called for revenge and to
</p>
<p>arm ourselves. I saw August Spies in the hall, and he told us that the police
</p>
<p>had been shooting our workingmen at McCormick's, and we should be ready
</p>
<p>with our arms. Then Rau came into the meeting, very much excited and
</p>
<p>said that a number of our people had been shot at McCormick's by the
</p>
<p>police. He called us to arms. Then Rau and Spies left the hall together.
</p>
<p>Both were much excited. The speech and talking of Spies in the hall hap-
</p>
<p>pened in this way. Spies would catch a man alone and talk about the
</p>
<p>shooting, or when he saw a crowd of four or five standing together he would
</p>
<p>talk to them to excite them and urge them on. The effect of his talking to
</p>
<p>us brought our temper to such heat that I and others were ready to take

</p>
<p>revenge on the police officers and the law. And we would have done almost
</p>
<p>anything to get revenge. If Spies and Rau had there and then started out
</p>
<p>and we had had our arms with us, we would have followed them to do harm
</p>
<p>at once."
</p>
<p>Such was the confession the brave Hubner first made to the police. On
</p>
<p>the 1 8th of May he made a second statement, as follows, adding a few
</p>
<p>further details as to the conspiracy :
</p>
<p>"On Tuesday, May 4, about 4 P.M., I went to the house of William
</p>
<p>Seliger, at 442 Sedgwick Street, and there I found William Seliger and
</p>
<p>Louis Lingg. I had been in Seliger's house the day before, and I took
</p>
<p>along with me when I left three bombs that is, three empty shells. Lingg
</p>
<p>also gave me the dynamite with which to fill them. Not knowing how, I
</p>
<p>28o ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>was afraid to fill them, and I brought them back to Lingg to fill them for
</p>
<p>me. When I got there, Seliger and Lingg were working, filling bombs or
</p>
<p>shells with dynamite. I went to work and helped them and got the bombs
</p>
<p>ready for use. They had some of them filled when I got there, but in all
</p>
<p>they filled and finished twenty round lead or metal bombs and about fifteen
</p>
<p>or eighteen long ones that is, I mean to say, made of gas-pipe, about six
</p>
<p>inches or more long. I saw there a lot more of dynamite and fuse. As I
</p>
<p>went away from there Seliger's house that evening, I took along with
</p>
<p>me four long bombs, but before I left we had all the bombs finished, ready
</p>
<p>for use. I saw about six men at 5 P.M. in Seliger's house, and when any
</p>
<p>one came Lingg always went to the door and waited upon them. That
</p>
<p>evening, May 4, at eight o'clock, I went to Neff's Hall, 58 Clybourn
</p>
<p>Avenue, and when I had been there only a few minutes I saw Lingg,
</p>
<p>Seliger and a little stout man, who carried a heavy satchel with a gray cloth
</p>
<p>cover. They came in together in Neff's Hall and placed the satchel in a
</p>
<p>little hallway leading to a ' gents' closet.' I was sent to Neff's Hall to see
</p>
<p>and report if there were many of our armed men in the hall who were wait-
</p>
<p>ing for bombs. As I had not been there long enough to find out and report
</p>
<p>back, Lingg and Seliger got tired of waiting at 442 Sedgwick Street and
</p>
<p>brought the satchel filled with bombs to Neff's Hall themselves. When
</p>
<p>Lingg saw me he came up to me and found fault with me for not reporting
</p>
<p>back sooner. He said there might have been lots of people there who
</p>
<p>failed to get bombs or shells. After that I went to supper, since Lingg
</p>
<p>was in the hall to look after things himself. The men I saw there were
</p>
<p>Hageman and Hermann. On Monday night, May 3, I was at Greif's Hall,
</p>
<p>54 West Lake Street, up to ten o'clock, and afterwards I also went into the
</p>
<p>saloon. There were about forty men sitting and standing around the bar-
</p>
<p>room. Some one called out that the so-called armed sections should go
</p>
<p>down into the basement, as there would be a meeting for them. Then forty
</p>
<p>of us went down, and we decided to hold a meeting there. This was about
</p>
<p>nine o'clock in the evening. Gottfried Waller was chosen president.
</p>
<p>George Engel was one of the speakers and originator of the plan then and
</p>
<p>there given to us to shoot and kill people and destroy property. He told
</p>
<p>us what to do and began in this way. He asked us if we knew about his

</p>
<p>plan. The majority said ' no.' Then he began to tell us that his plan was
</p>
<p>to call a meeting for the next evening at the Haymarket, and there draw
</p>
<p>out as many police as possible, so that the outside parts of the city would
</p>
<p>not be strongly protected by the police. The signal for action would be
</p>
<p>given, and they should set fire to buildings in several places and in all parts
</p>
<p>of the city. One building at Wicker Park was mentioned, and as soon as
</p>
<p>they saw it on fire, then they should attack the police stations, throw dyna-
</p>
<p>mite bombs into the stations, kill the police officers and destroy the stations.
</p>
<p>In case a patrol wagon came, they should throw a bomb among the police-
</p>
<p>men, and if that did not stop them, then they should kill the horses attached
</p>
<p>to the wagons with their revolvers or guns. After that they should destroy
</p>
<p>all the property they could. The circular that called for revenge and to
</p>
<p>arms I saw at the Monday night meeting in the basement, 54 West Lake
</p>
<p>Street, where Engel spoke and gave us the plan of revolution. The lying
</p>
<p>of Engel about the killing of six of our brothers at McCormick's factory
</p>
<p>started me so that I was ready to do anything desperate. The speech of
</p>
<p>Engel in the basement that evening worked on me so that I went to Seli-
</p>
<p>ger's house on Tuesday afternoon, May 4, and helped to finish the bombs,
</p>

</p>
<p>281
</p>
<p>as I stated before. George Engel told those that had no arms to stay at
</p>
<p>home away from the Hay market meeting, and that men who had arms but
</p>
<p>no courage should also stay at home. In that meeting there were present
</p>
<p>Adolph Fischer, Gottfried Waller, George Engel, Breitenfeld, Schnaubelt,
</p>
<p>John Thielen, Abraham Hermann, Herman Hageman, the two Lehmans and
</p>
<p>Hubner. Waller told us to go ahead and do our work, that he would be
</p>
<p>with us. The meeting lasted from nine o'clock to eleven. Fischer and
</p>
<p>others agreed to have the circular printed calling the meeting at the Hay-
</p>
<p>market for Tuesday night, May 4. After all the plans had been explained
</p>
<p>to us Fischer said ' That is the one ' meaning the murderous plan ' that we
</p>
<p>adopted in our group meeting.' Every division group were to make their
</p>
<p>own arrangements. The North Side armed men should meet Tuesday
</p>
<p>evening, May 4, at the foot of Webster Avenue and Lincoln Park, at the
</p>
<p>Schiller monument. I went there. I could not find enough of our people
</p>
<p>there, as the night was dark and those present were scattered. I got tired
</p>
<p>of waiting for others. The four bombs I had with me that night I took to
</p>
<p>the North Avenue Pier and threw them into the lake. Then I went home
</p>
<p>and went to bed. This was about ten o'clock. I did not hear anything of
</p>
<p>the shooting or the explosion of the bomb or the killing of the policemen at
</p>
<p>the Haymarket until the next morning when I got up. I went home so

</p>
<p>early on that evening because I had a headache from the smell of the dyna-
</p>
<p>282 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>mite used in filling the bombs. We filled thirty-five in all. The word
</p>
<p>' Ruhe ' was intended as the signal word. If it should appear in the
</p>
<p>Arbeiter-Zeitung May 4, in the 'Briefkasten,' then that would be a notifica-
</p>
<p>tion to be ready for the revolution. We were to watch also for the fire and
</p>
<p>shooting signals as well as the appearance of that word in the paper. We
</p>
<p>were then all to get ready. I only know of Lingg as a manufacturer of
</p>
<p>bombs. The plan was presented to the men to go and blow up the Chicago
</p>
<p>Avenue Station. Also many others were to blow up the Larrabee Street
</p>
<p>Station and the Webster Avenue Station. The work I did on the bombs
</p>
<p>was drilling holes in them. This statement I make of my own free will and
</p>
<p>accord in the presence of the officers named, and it is true and correct.
</p>
<p>And I furthermore will say that I will not take any bribe to change my

<p>statement or make denials ; neither will I leave the city or the State as long
</p>
<p>as this case is pending in court, unless I have the consent of Capt. Schaack ;
</p>
<p>that I always will be ready to give testimony for the people, whenever I am
</p>
<p>called on in this case, and that I will never make a second statement, that
</p>
<p>is to say, to a notary public or a justice of the peace, in writing or verbally ;
</p>
<p>that I will only make a statement under oath for the grand jury of the Crim-
</p>
<p>inal Court, or Capt. M. J. Schaack."
</p>
<p>Here follow the signature, etc., and the notarial acknowledgment.
</p>
<p>On the 24th of May, Hubner, among other things, stated that he knew
</p>
<p>Herman Muntzenberg.
</p>
<p>"I met him," he said, "as I was carrying around hand-bills for the
</p>
<p>meeting called May 4 at the Haymarket. Muntzenberg went with me to
</p>
<p>Seliger's house that afternoon. We saw Lingg and Seliger making the
</p>
<p>dynamite bombs, and we helped them to make them. Muntzenberg and I
</p>
<p>spent about three hours in Seliger's house that afternoon. Muntzenberg
</p>
<p>was there when it was stated that the dynamite bombs should be carried
</p>
<p>down to Neff s Hall, 58 Clybourn Avenue, that night. Muntzenberg and I,
</p>
<p>by order of Lingg, went down to Neff's Hall to see how things looked there
</p>
<p>and report back to him. That is why Muntzenberg went to meet Lingg
</p>
<p>and Seliger to help them to carry the bombs to Neff's place."
</p>
<p>Since the trial I have learned that Hubner knew a great deal more than
</p>
<p>he divulged in his confession, and that he was one of the parties chosen to

<p>ENOUGH was at this time known to make George Engel a mark for
</p>
<p>speedy police attention. It had been established beyond a doubt that
</p>
<p>he was one of the central figures in the conspiracy, and it was not long be-
</p>
<p>fore a warrant was secured charging him with murder. I detailed Officers
</p>
<p>Stift and Whalen to serve the document, and they found him at his home,
</p>
<p>No. 286 Milwaukee Avenue. He was a man about fifty years old*, stoutly
</p>
<p>built, round-shouldered, weighing about 170 pounds, and about five feet
</p>
<p>eight inches in height. He was married and had a daughter about sixteen
</p>
<p>years of age. He was by trade a painter, but he and his wife conducted a toy-
</p>
<p>store at the place where they lived. In addition to toys, they sold cigars
</p>
<p>and tobacco. The building he lived in was a two-story frame, and his sup-
</p>
<p>port came principally from his business. He always claimed to be a very
</p>
<p>good friend of policemen, many of whom he said he knew, and they all, he
</p>
<p>claimed, liked him. He was very radical in his ideas, however, and at all
</p>
<p>times took an active interest in Anarchist meetings. In fact, he was one of
</p>
<p>the most rabid of them all. He was a successful organizer and a hard, per-
</p>
<p>sistent worker for the cause. He was one of the most positive, determined
</p>
<p>speakers in the German language in Chicago. He could hold a house all
</p>
<p>night, and his auditors were always charmed with his ingenious argument,
</p>
<p>his powerful invective and his captivating sophistry. He was well read on
</p>
<p>all topics bearing upon Anarchy, had a wonderful memory, and he could
</p>
<p>always promptly give a plausible "reason for the faith that was in him."
</p>
<p>His speeches were always plain, and, although he talked rapidly, he spoke
</p>
<p>with a directness and force that took complete possession of the illiterate and
</p>
<p>unthinking rabble. He could work up his auditors to the point of despera-
</p>
<p>tion, and with a word he could have sent them out to pillage and murder.
</p>
<p>It was his brain alone that evolved the gigantic plan of murdering hundreds

<p>of people and laying waste thousands of dollars' worth of property in Chi-
</p>
<p>cago, and the fact that he found so many willing to execute his purpose
</p>
<p>fully proved his power and influence over his Anarchist followers. Like all
</p>
<p>rabid Anarchists, he had no use for clergymen or the church, Sisters of Char-
</p>
<p>ity or anything else that had a tinge of religion in it. He called them
</p>
<p>all hypocrites and frauds. He was a great admirer of Louise Michel, the

</p>
<p>French Anarchist, because of her fearlessness and courage, and he never
</p>
<p>failed to bestow words of praise on Most, whose work he fairly worshiped.
</p>
<p>The organs of the Anarchists in Chicago he did not think radical enough,,
</p>
<p>and so he ventured to publish a paper of his own called the Anarchist,
</p>
<p>which, however, did not survive long. He was known as an honest man in
</p>
<p>all his dealings with his fellow-men, earnest in his convictions, but withal a.
</p>
<p>most dangerous leader and most unrelenting in his hatred of existing
</p>
<p>society, and thoroughly unscrupulous in the methods to be used to bring
</p>
<p>about a change.
</p>
<p>Engel was always cool and collected, rarely exhibiting signs of excite-
</p>
<p>ment. This fact was brought out most
</p>
<p>strikingly when the officers found him
</p>
<p>at his home, on the i8th of May, at
</p>
<p>five o'clock, and informed him that
</p>
<p>they had a warrant for his arrest on
</p>
<p>the charge of murder. He was paint-
</p>
<p>ing in his house at the time, and, turn-
</p>
<p>ing to the officers with a smile on his
</p>
<p>face, he nonchalantly remarked :
</p>
<p>"Well, this is very strange."
</p>
<p>The officers then told him that I
</p>
<p>desired to see him immediately, and
</p>
<p>he responded that if that was the case
</p>
<p>he supposed he must go with them.
</p>
<p>When he arrived at the station he
</p>
<p>was informed again of the nature of
</p>
<p>the charge against him, and the floor,
</p>
<p>so to speak, was accorded him for any
</p>
<p>explanations he might desire to make.
</p>
<p>"I am the most innocent man in
</p>
<p>the world," he began, in a slow, delib-
</p>
<p>erate voice. " I could not hurt a child or see any one hurt. "
</p>
<p>Engel was then subjected to some close questioning, and all he could

</p>
<p>be made to say was this :
</p>
<p>" On Monday, May 3, I was working for a friend of mine named Koch.
</p>
<p>I was doing some painting for him that evening between the hours of eight
</p>
<p>and nine o'clock. I then went to a meeting at Greif's Hall, 54 West Lake
</p>
<p>Street. The meeting was held in the basement. I don't know Mr. Waller.
</p>
<p>I do not belong to the Northwest Side group. I don't belong to any armed
</p>
<p>men. I don't know of any plan or conspiracy. I did not give any plan at:
</p>
<p>that meeting. I was there at the meeting only a little while. I did not
</p>
<p>speak there, nor had I anything to say to any one. I did not, and was not
</p>
<p>authorized by any one to give a plan."

<p>THE CURSE OF ELOQUENCE.
</p>

</p>
<p>He thus flatly contradicted every charge and seemed determined to put
</p>
<p>a bold front upon the situation. Confronted by the facts, he never winced,
</p>
<p>but kept up a bold exterior. He was then locked up at the station. Sub-
</p>
<p>sequently his wife called and met him in my office.
</p>
<p>"Papa, see what trouble you have got yourself into," she sadly
</p>
<p>remarked.
</p>
<p>"Mamma," he responded, "I cannot help it. What is in me must
</p>
<p>come out."
</p>
<p>"Why," I interposed, "don't you stop that nonsense?"
</p>
<p>"I know," replied Engel, "I have promised my wife so many times that
</p>
<p>I would stop it. But I cannot do it.
</p>
<p>I cannot help it that I am possessed of
</p>
<p>some eloquence and enthusiasm. It
</p>
<p>is a curse to some people to be pos-
</p>
<p>sessed of this knowledge. I cannot
</p>
<p>help it that I am gifted in that way. I
</p>
<p>am not the first man that has been
</p>
<p>locked up for this cause, but I will bear
</p>
<p>it like a man. Louise Michel is a great
</p>
<p>woman. She has been locked up and
</p>
<p>suffered for principle. I am willing to
</p>
<p>do the same."
</p>
<p>When Engel was asked where he
</p>
<p>had been on Tuesday evening, May 4,
</p>
<p>he responded : " At home all night,
</p>
<p>lying on a lounge."
</p>
<p>Two days after Engel's arrest I
</p>
<p>secured a statement in addition to
</p>
<p>that of Hubner from Gottfried Wal-
</p>
<p>ler, implicating the nervy Anarchist
</p>
<p>in the conspiracy in connection _with
</p>
<p>"the plan."
</p>
<p>I therefore thought it best to have Engel face his accuser, Waller, and,

</p>
<p>on the evening of May 24, at 9:30 o'clock, the two men were brought together
</p>
<p>in my office. Mr. Furthmann, who was present, with the officers, asked
</p>
<p>Engel, the moment he was brought in, if he knew the party before him.
</p>
<p>Engel, without the slightest hesitancy or tremor, answered in the negative.
</p>
<p>He was next asked if he had not attended the meeting at No. 54 West
</p>
<p>Lake Street, and Engel stated that he had come in late during the proceed-
</p>
<p>ings.
</p>
<p>Waller then reiterated his charge, that Engel was not only a speaker on
</p>
<p>that occasion, but the man who had submitted apian for murder and destruc-
</p>
<p>tion.

</p>
<p>" In fact," said Waller, "you were the only man who urged a revolution
</p>
<p>and spoke about your plan."
</p>
<p>When questioned as to what he had to say to this, Engel retorted that
</p>
<p>"it was not true," as he had not been authorized by any one to propose a
</p>
<p>plan. Inasmuch as the accusation of Waller failed to make any perceptible
</p>
<p>impression on Engel's mind, I decided to see how the presence of another
</p>
<p>accuser would affect his deportment and answers. Accordingly Ernst Hub-
</p>
<p>ner was asked if he would face Engel, and, an answer being given firmly in
</p>
<p>the affirmative, Engel was again brought back into the office. There were
</p>
<p>present at this, as well as at the former interview, Furthmann, Whalen,
</p>
<p>Stift, Schuettler, Hoffman, Loewenstein and Rehm. The moment Engel
</p>
<p>was brought up by an officer, Assistant State's Attorney Furthmann asked
</p>
<p>Hubner if he was acquainted with Engel. Hubner replied, "Yes, I know
</p>
<p>him."
</p>
<p>Addressing Engel, I said :
</p>
<p>"This is Ernst Hubner. "He says that he knows you, and he also has
</p>
<p>made a statement against you."
</p>
<p>Engel replied that he did not know the man, whereupon Hubner reiter-
</p>
<p>ated his acquaintanceship, and added :
</p>
<p>"Your name is Engel, and you keep a toy-store on Milwaukee Avenue.
</p>
<p>You made speeches at 58 Clybourn Avenue. I saw and heard you several
</p>
<p>times. I saw you in a meeting May 3, 9 P.M., at 54 West Lake Street."
</p>
<p>"Engel," I interrupted, "listen, and I will read you what Hubner said
</p>
<p>about you."
</p>
<p>Engel assented, and the statement of Hubner, as already given, was
</p>
<p>read.
</p>
<p>"It is false," replied Engel; "but if that good man says I did say so,
</p>
<p>then you can believe him. I do not care."
</p>
<p>"Where did you see Engel last? " inquired Furthmann of Hubner.
</p>
<p>" I saw him at the meeting held at Greif's Hall, 54 West Lake Street,
</p>
<p>where I heard him speak about the revenge circular and his plan, which he
</p>
<p>said had been adopted by the Northwest Side group. He spoke of the
</p>
<p>plan as I have heretofore explained in my affidavit to the officers."
</p>
<p>" You still say that that affidavit is true in every respect ? "

</p>
<p>" I do," emphatically replied Hubner.
</p>
<p>" It is not so, and it is not true," stoutly replied Engel.
</p>
<p>"Well," said I, "there are other people, and we will have more, who
</p>
<p>will prove that you did make a revolutionary speech and submitted a plan
</p>
<p>calling on your people to get ready with their arms and do violence. If
</p>
<p>other witnesses are produced, will you still have the same answer to
</p>
<p>give ? "
</p>
<p>" It would not be true ; it is not so," reiterated Engel.
</p>
<p>"But," I added, "suppose I produce twenty more men who will accuse
</p>
<p>THE HARDEST OF THEM ALL.
</p>
<p>287
</p>
<p>you the same as Waller and Hubner have accused you, what then would you
</p>
<p>have to say ? "
</p>
<p>" My answer," responded Engel, "would be that I have never spoken as
</p>
<p>charged against me. It is not true."
</p>
<p>Engel had evidently made up his mind to deny everything, and, knowing
</p>
<p>his character for stubbornness, I made no further efforts to secure a state-
</p>
<p>ment from him. A man who could originate such a cold-blooded scheme as
</p>
<p>he had proposed and part of it was actually carried out in bloodshed was
</p>
<p>evidently not the kind to yield, and I allowed him to ruminate over his pre-
</p>
<p>dicament in a cell below until the ayth of May, when he was sent to the
</p>
<p>County Jail. As will subsequently appear, he never showed signs of weak-
</p>
<p>ness during his incarceration from the time he was taken from his house
</p>
<p>that night until he dropped from the
</p>
<p>gallows, dying the hardest of them all.
</p>
<p>A half dozen such men at a critical
</p>
<p>time could upset a whole city, and it
</p>
<p>was fortunate for Chicago that there
</p>
<p>were not more like him during the
</p>
<p>troublous days of 1886.
</p>
<p>SOME two days before Engel was
</p>
<p>brought in, GOTTFRIED WALLER was
</p>
<p>arrested by Officer Whalen. It ap-
</p>
<p>peared that he had been selling revol-
</p>
<p>vers to workingmen, and after being
</p>
<p>taken to the station, on the i4th of
</p>
<p>May, he was released on bail. His
</p>
<p>importance then as a conspicuous
</p>
<p>figure in the Monday night meeting,
</p>
<p>when the murderous "plan" was
</p>
<p>adopted, was not clearly apparent,
</p>
<p>but he was kept under surveillance
</p>
<p>and his antecedents carefully inquired
</p>
<p>into. Thielen, in his confession on the very day Waller was arrested,

<p>referred to him as having presided at that meeting, and, in describing
</p>
<p>a man who called at Lingg's room on Tuesday afternoon, May 4, said
</p>
<p>he " believed he worked at Brunswick & Balke's factory." Hubner, in his
</p>
<p>affidavit on the i8th of May, stated that Waller had presided on the occasion
</p>
<p>referred to, and had even urged them to go ahead and do their work, and he
</p>
<p>would be with them meaning their work of destruction. On these and
</p>
<p>other facts a warrant was secured for his arrest for murder, and on the 2oth
</p>
<p>of May he was again taken into custody by Officers Whalen and Stift. He
</p>
<p>was a Swiss by birth, a cabinet-maker by occupation, and worked at the

</p>
<p>arrest was thirty-six years, and he was a married man with one child. At
</p>
<p>the time of his first arrest he was living at No. 590 Milwaukee Avenue, and
</p>
<p>at his second arrest he was found at No. 105 North Wells Street. He had
</p>
<p>been only three years in America, and had scarcely settled in Chicago before
</p>
<p>he began attending the Anarchist meetings. He always frequented the
</p>
<p>gatherings where Swiss people assembled, and on a search being made of
</p>
<p>their meeting-place, 105 North Wells Street, on the yth of May, the police
</p>
<p>found twelve guns. It had been the headquarters for the most dangerous
</p>
<p>element in the order, and on Waller's visiting the place after the trial of the
</p>
<p>Anarchists a serious attempt was made on his life. He was called a spy,
</p>
<p>and was pursued until he found safety under the shadow of the Chicago
</p>
<p>Avenue Station. Several parties were afterwards arrested for this assault.
</p>
<p>They subsequently threw a piece of iron through the window of the house
</p>
<p>where Waller was stopping, but this was the last futile exhibition of their
</p>
<p>rage.
</p>
<p>In view of his testimony^ which appears further on in the review of the
</p>
<p>trial, Waller was given an unconditional release, and he has since con-
</p>
<p>ducted himself as a peaceable citizen.
</p>
<p>After his confession bearing directly on the principal parties in the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, Waller wrote out his experience with the Lehr und Wehr Verein
</p>
<p>in particular and his connection with Anarchy in general. His story is as
</p>
<p>follows :
</p>
<p>"On the 25th of January, 1884, I arrived in Chicago from Easton, Pa.
</p>
<p>I lived sixteen months on Grove Avenue, Humboldt. I was never a Social-
</p>
<p>ist or Anarchist. 1 understood very little of the former and nothing at all
</p>
<p>of the latter. After residing for a while at the place mentioned, I moved to
</p>
<p>Milwaukee Avenue, near No. 636, Thalia Hall, on that street. Here I
</p>
<p>noticed people uniformed and armed about twice a week. They would
</p>
<p>enter this hall, and, by making inquiries, I was informed that these people
</p>
<p>belonged to the second company of the Lehr und Wehr Verein and that they
</p>
<p>were a sort of 'Schuetzen Verein,' which practiced twice a week in the
</p>
<p>North Chicago Schuetzen Park (Sharpshooters' Park). Their principles
</p>
<p>were kept secret. As I was an expert sharpshooter and had a passion for
</p>
<p>military exercises, I accepted an invitation from their commander to par-

</p>
<p>ticipate in their practices. We met on the following Sunday at Thalia
</p>
<p>Hall, at five o'clock in the morning, and continued for some time. We dis-
</p>
<p>persed by each going in different directions toward the park, so as not to
</p>
<p>arouse any suspicion. On account of cold weather only fourteen of us
</p>
<p>came together. It was no fun to walk knee-deep in the snow ; still we were
</p>
<p>feeling good since we were going to practice shooting. After several
</p>
<p>rounds of drinks, which were called for in payment of the stand we used on
</p>
<p>such occasions, we erected two targets and commenced practicing. I soon
</p>
<p>noticed that the company consisted of good marksmen, and that day I was
</p>
<p>pronounced the best marksman among them. After that I wanted to
</p>
<p>become a member of the Verein, as I had been asked several times by some
</p>
<p>of them to join. I called at Thalia Hall one Monday evening and was
</p>
<p>taken to the cellar, which I entered through a secret door by means of a

<p>ladder. Here I saw thirty to thirty-five men practicing shooting at a
</p>
<p>target. The cellar was not .well lighted except at the north end, where the
</p>
<p>targets stood. The people and all the surroundings looked quite advent-
</p>
<p>urous to me. One of the members then approached me and asked if I was
</p>
<p>a Socialist. I answered, 'Yes,' in an off-hand way. The first sergeant of
</p>
<p>the company, August Krueger, told me beforehand to do this. I paid my
</p>
<p>initiation fee, got a red card numbered 19, by which number I was after-
</p>
<p>wards known, and I was then a member. All the members were very
</p>
<p>cautious before me on account of my not being well known to them. We
</p>
<p>practiced every Monday and Wednesday, drilling and shooting. I paid a
</p>
<p>great deal of attention to these exercises. I never missed a meeting, and
</p>
<p>consequently I soon gained the confidence of all the members.
</p>
<p>"At the first general meeting, which was held every last Tuesday of
</p>
<p>each month, at No. 54 West Lake Street, I was enlightened, and how I
</p>
<p>was enlightened will appear as I proceed with my statement. I now desire
</p>
<p>first to speak of the Lehr und Wehr Verein. This society consists of four
</p>
<p>companies from various parts of the city, and forms a revolutionary military
</p>
<p>organization. The first company belongs to the North Side; second company,
</p>
<p>the Northwest Side ; third company, the Southwest Side, and the fourth
</p>
<p>company was formed by the commander at Pullman. The first company
</p>
<p>was the strongest and consisted of about one hundred and twenty members.
</p>
<p>The second consisted of thirty-five mem-

<p>inscribed L. W. V., dark pantaloons and black slouch hats. Every com-
</p>
<p>pany had a captain, lieutenant and first sergeant. Besides these the
</p>
<p>company had the following officers : A corresponding secretary, financial
</p>
<p>secretary, treasurer, quartermaster, and a Lehr und Wehr auditor. The
</p>
<p>commander received a monthly salary of $15.00, and the financial secre-
</p>
<p>tary $4.00. The commander was Gustav Breitenfeld. Captain of the
</p>
<p>first company, Abraham Hermann ; second company, Bernhard Schrader ;
</p>
<p>third company, H. Betzel, and fourth company, Paul Pull. Under com-
</p>
<p>mand of these people, the companies were drilled and instructed. The
</p>
<p>corresponding secretary attended to all the correspondence, domestic and
</p>
<p>foreign, which was not a very easy job, because we corresponded with the
</p>
<p>Internationale of the whole country. The financial secretary collected the
</p>
<p>dues, and turned them all over to myself as treasurer. The quartermaster,
</p>
<p>A. Hermann, had to supply arms and ammunition. The Lehr und Wehr
</p>
<p>auditor had to investigate all complaints and to impose all fines and collect
</p>
<p>the same. The meeting-place of the first company was at Mueller's Hall,
</p>
<p>on North Avenue and Sedgwick Street, in basement : of the second com-
</p>
<p>pany, at Thalia Hall, on Milwaukee Avenue; of the third company, at

</p>
<p>Vorwaerts Turn Hall, on West Twelfth Street, and of the fourth com-
</p>
<p>pany, at Rosenheim, in Pullman. Another curiously mixed company also
</p>
<p>belonged to the Verein. It was commanded by Captain Betzel, of the
</p>
<p>third company, and it had nothing to do with us in a business way.
</p>
<p>"The whole battalion assembled once every month on pleasant days on
</p>
<p>the prairie behind the ice-houses of Schofield & Co., on the West Side, and
</p>
<p>practiced skirmish drills. The commands were given in English, and no
</p>
<p>one knew the members by name only by numbers.
</p>
<p>"This brings me to the first general meeting of the Verein at No. 54
</p>
<p>West Lake Street that I attended. Before the opening of the meeting,
</p>
<p>every one who entered the hall was examined so that none but members
</p>
<p>might get in. The meetings would be called to order by the secretary, and
</p>
<p>then a chairman and a doorkeeper would be chosen. August Krause, of
</p>
<p>the second company, was generally called upon to officiate as chairman.
</p>
<p>First of all the correspondence would be read, and at one meeting a letter
</p>
<p>was read from Most, of New York, which pertained to arms. In the first
</p>
<p>meeting Commander Breitenfeld was ordered to proceed to Pullman every
</p>
<p>Sunday to work for the cause, and for his services he received a remunera-
</p>
<p>tion of $3 for each trip. The new company in that town finally reported a
</p>
<p>large increase of. fine material with strong Anarchistic doctrines. The
</p>
<p>quartermaster, who then was Lehnert, was ordered to purchase forty rifles
</p>
<p>and four boxes of ammunition, each containing 4,000 rounds. The treas-
</p>
<p>urer delivered to him $250, and afterwards we duly received the rifles from
</p>
<p>a firm in St. Louis. After all business had been transacted one of the
</p>
<p>eager members delivered a speech touching the best means of bringing on
</p>
<p>the social revolution. He proved very violent in his sentiments, and all
</p>
<p>present agreed with him that this revolution could only be accomplished
</p>
<p>with fire, powder, lead and dynamite. For a public attack on the streets
</p>
<p>of Chicago the speaker considered us too weak. As to the ' property beasts,'
</p>
<p>as he called the small owners of buildings, he regarded them as our biggest
</p>
<p>enemies, as they would attack us from their windows and defeat us, and
</p>
<p>consequently our only hope for a victory lay in the torch and dynamite.
</p>
<p>When Chicago would be surrounded by fire and destroyed, these 'beasts,'
</p>
<p>he said, would be obliged to take refuge on the prairies, and there it would

<p>be very easy for us to master them by our unmerciful proceedings. If this
</p>
<p>was done, other cities, like New York, St. Louis, Pittsburg, etc., would follow
</p>
<p>our example. Then all eyes would be centered on the Anarchists of Chi-
</p>
<p>cago, and therefore we would proclaim the Commune.
</p>
<p>" All these utterances were accepted with great applause, and every one
</p>
<p>wanted to commence immediately. I thought differently. I remembered
</p>
<p>the revolution of 1848 in Germany and that of 1871 in Paris arid its conse-
</p>
<p>quences.
</p>
<p>"Krause, after this speech, took the floor and spoke in favor of the revo-
</p>
<p>lution. He stated that they ought to invite the Anarchists of other cities
</p>
<p>to join them here, and then we could commence the work of destruction.
</p>
<p>Then other members gave their views, and the meeting adjourned with an
</p>
<p>injunction that every one should be silent with reference to our proceedings.
</p>
<p>"This brings me to the revolutionary party. This organization consists
</p>
<p>of the following sections and groups : The Lehr und Wehr Verein, com-
</p>
<p>mander Breitenfeld ; Northwest Side group, commanders Engel, Fischer
</p>
<p>and Grumm ; North Side group, commanders Neebe, Lingg and Hermann ;
</p>
<p>American group, commanders Spies, Parsons and Fielden ; Karl Marx
</p>
<p>292 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>Group, commander Schilling ; the Freiheit group ; the armed sections of
</p>
<p>the International Carpenters' Union and the Metal-workers' Union. The
</p>
<p>whole party is under the leadership of a general committee. This com-
</p>
<p>mittee is composed of Spies, Schwab, Parsons, Neebe, Rau, Hirschberger,
</p>
<p>Deusch and Belz. The committee held their meetings in one of the rooms
</p>
<p>of the Arbeiter-Zeitung and received weekly reports from the delegates of
</p>
<p>the various groups. A part of the monthly dues was delivered to the gen-
</p>
<p>eral committee, and all expenses for traveling at the instance of the agita-
</p>
<p>tion committee (Parsons and Schwab) and for arms were paid by the
</p>
<p>quartermaster.
</p>
<p>" On one occasion I attended a general meeting of the revolutionary
</p>
<p>party at No. 54 West Lake Street, at which the whole party of armed
</p>
<p>sections were represented. After all precautions had been taken as to
</p>
<p>safety, August Spies took the chair and Neebe. acted as secretary. We had
</p>
<p>to produce our cards of membership on entering, and every group was called
</p>
<p>by name, and each representative had to rise in his seat for close inspection.
</p>
<p>The first business was a complaint from the Northwest group and the Lehr
</p>
<p>und Wehr Verein that the funds had been mismanaged and thrown away.
</p>
<p>Both organizations declared that they would withdraw their delegates and,
</p>
<p>after that, act independently. Spies became as furious, as a snake when
</p>
<p>trodden upon, and he got up and told them that they might leave immedi-
</p>
<p>ately. This started a war of words. Some retorted that the Arbeiter-
</p>
<p>Zeitung was not radical enough, and it must be made different from that
</p>
<p>moment. The members of the general committee were called impostors
</p>
<p>and loafers. The Lehr und Wehr Verein had paid some $75 for the pur-
</p>
<p>chase of arms, but they had neither seen the arms nor the money. Engel
</p>
<p>and the Northwest Side group were brought into the wrangle, and he was
</p>
<p>called a traitor. They said that Engel would bring the whole party to ruin,
</p>
<p>likewise the Arbeiter-Zeitung, but they (Engel and the paper) did not care
</p>
<p>so long as it enriched themselves. Finally the Northwest group withdrew,
</p>
<p>and some of the members of the Lehr und Wehr Verein shortly afterwards
</p>
<p>followed suit. From this time on there were constant disputes.
</p>
<p>"Engel and Grunewald collected money for a new paper and started
</p>
<p>the Anarchist, a paper like Most's Freiheit in New York. Shortly after

<p>these societies had left the hall, the fight was taken up again by some of the
</p>
<p>females who were present, Mrs. Parsons, Mrs. Boiling, Mrs. Schwab and
</p>
<p>Mrs. Holmes, and it was continued until Spies was declared out of order.
</p>
<p>Hirschberger then reported the result of the sale of revolutionary literature,
</p>
<p>such as the works of Louise Michel, Most's 'Revolutionary Warfare,' etc.,
</p>
<p>and he stated that it had exceeded his expectations. After this they dis-
</p>
<p>cussed picnics, and a number desired them to be held outside of the city.
</p>
<p>Sheffield was suggested, because by going there they would bring in more
</p>
<p>money, and when there they could speak more freely their Anarchist senti-
</p>
<p>ments. It was finally decided to hold a meeting of the workingmen on
</p>
<p>Market Square on Thanksgiving day, and Parsons was ordered to make the
</p>
<p>necessary arrangements. Spies called attention to the importance of every
</p>
<p>one attending that meeting, and urged that they should not come without a
</p>
<p>bomb or a revolver. The bombs, he said, they could purchase at the
</p>
<p>Arbeiter-Zeitung office, four for $i. The time was near, he said, when the
</p>
<p>long-looked-for revolution would take place, and so they should avail them-
</p>
<p>selves of every opportunity. He wanted all Anarchists to work against the
</p>
<p>eight-hour movement, because if it should prove successful our movement

<p>WALLER'S REMINISCENCES. 293
</p>
<p>would receive a set-back for several years. Our cause would not be hastened
</p>
<p>by it. He complained about our small gain in numbers and attributed it to
</p>
<p>the poor agitation of some of the members. After this I left the hall.
</p>
<p>" On the day before Thanksgiving we drilled in Thalia Hall. At the end
</p>
<p>of the exercise we were all requested to attend the meeting the following
</p>
<p>day, and Lehnert distributed some bombs in the shape of gas-pipe. He
</p>
<p>stated that he could only get four, but that on the next day at one o'clock
</p>
<p>every member could have one by calling at the hall. The next day most of
</p>
<p>the members put in an appearance. Members of the Northwest Side group
</p>
<p>also called. Adolph Fischer was there with a basketful of bombs like the
</p>
<p>one I saw the day before, which was the first time I had ever seen a bomb,
</p>
<p>and he told us distinctly to use them in case the Market Square meeting was
</p>
<p>dispersed. He cut a piece of fuse about the length of one on a bomb, put
</p>
<p>it on the table and lighted it with a cigar. He showed the way it worked
</p>
<p>and posted us as to the time it would have to burn before a bomb to which it
</p>
<p>might be attached should be thrown. He also showed us the way we should
</p>
<p>throw a bomb, and after this exhibition we all proceeded to the meeting.
</p>
<p>" On arriving at Market Square, I noticed a stage made out of barrels,
</p>
<p>with a red flag attached to it, and this was our meeting-place. Parsons
</p>
<p>mounted the platform and addressed the assemblage, which consisted of
</p>
<p>about a thousand people. It was a fortunate thing that the crowd was no
</p>
<p>larger, else the bloody bath of May 4 would have taken place that day, in
</p>
<p>view of all the preparations and the hostile feeling among us. The North-
</p>
<p>west Side group was fully armed, and the preparations were alike complete
</p>
<p>among all the the other sections. Schwab, Fielden and Neebe were pres-
</p>
<p>ent, but none of them spoke. After they had waved the red flag the meet-
</p>
<p>ing adjourned. Bad, cold weather contributed to the small attendance.
</p>
<p>"After reading in the newspapers that on a certain Monday some of
</p>
<p>McCormick's strikers would resume work, the armed groups were called to
</p>
<p>a meeting at Goercke's Hall, on Twentieth Street and Blue Island Avenue.
</p>
<p>Reinhold Krueger and Tannenberg represented the second company of the.
</p>
<p>Lehr und Wehr Verein, and I joined them on the way to the place of meet-
</p>
<p>ing. Arriving there, I found most of the different sections represented, and
</p>
<p>the meeting opened. Gustav Belz, of the Metal-workers' Union, and

<p>employed at McCormick's, was chairman, and after some discussion we con-
</p>
<p>cluded to stop the reopening of the factory by force. On account of the
</p>
<p>short time for a proper notification to our members, we decided to have our
</p>
<p>well-known signal, ' Y, come Monday ' (which would mean that all was ripe
</p>
<p>for action, and our men should came to our regular meeting place, 54 West
</p>
<p>Lake Street), in the 'Briefkasten' of the Arbeiter-Zeitung, and it was
</p>
<p>accordingly done. We also at the meeting conferred with respect to having
</p>
<p>some of our men mix up with the 'scabs' by going to work with them in the
</p>
<p>factory, and then, when the moment for action arrived, they should set the
</p>
<p>factory on fire in several places. Those who were to do this were not to act,
</p>
<p>however, until they learned the result of the meeting that was to be held
</p>
<p>under the call of our signal, 'Y. ' During the same da)', after the meeting,
</p>
<p>Belz and Tannenberg carried several bombs out to the Black Road. What
</p>
<p>happened the following Monday at the factory everybody knows. Strikers
</p>
<p>and others assembled by thousands The great bell at the factory rang, and
</p>
<p>the ' scabs ' went to work. During the day disturbances followed and many-
</p>
<p>arrests were made of people who were found to have concealed weapons, and
</p>
<p>who were afterwards fined $10 in the Police Court.
</p>
<p>294 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>"But a change took place the following Tuesday. In accordance with
</p>
<p>the signal published in the Arbeiier-Zeitung, about 180 of our people gath-
</p>
<p>ered at No. 54 West Lake Street. Most of them carried their arms and
</p>
<p>some carried bombs. I saw Suess, and some others unknown to me, have
</p>
<p>bombs of the round pattern. These men even had their rifles with them,
</p>
<p>and everyone knew what was up. The several sections formed in platoons.
</p>
<p>Belz was elected chairman, and they consulted as to what should be done.
</p>
<p>First they regretted that the strikers had not reached McCormick's that
</p>
<p>Monday morning, before the arrival of the police, in time to secure posses-
</p>
<p>sion of the place, and then Betzel of the third company spoke and insisted
</p>
<p>that they should go around there during the night, secure good positions and
</p>
<p>then attack the patrol wagons as they passed on the following morning.
</p>
<p>He said he would give strict instructions to his company to obey his com-
</p>
<p>mand, and then, when the police came to take their positions, they should
</p>
<p>be met with a good reception from well-aimed rifles. About fifty members
</p>
<p>wanted this plan carried out, but I noticed that most of them carried their
</p>
<p>hearts in their pants, and had very little courage. Excuses after excuses
</p>
<p>were made. Suess gave his bomb to a comrade and told him that when he
</p>
<p>thought of his wife and home he had doubts about going into an uncertain
</p>
<p>adventure. Balthasar Rau also protested against the plan. Some one sug-
</p>
<p>gested that they should stay there, in the hall, all night. Belz declared that
</p>
<p>he was of the same opinion about remaining ; but, he said, he had a better
</p>
<p>plan to reach Mr. McCormick. It was very easy, he said, to attack this
</p>
<p>money baron in his own house. He described the house and rooms, and
</p>
<p>the location of the windows, and said that they should throw one of these
</p>
<p>' play balls ' in through the window of the room where McCormick would
</p>
<p>be sitting, and send him flying to heaven. This course should be taken
</p>
<p>by some one of those present, of his own accord, so that no second or third
</p>
<p>party would know the perpetrator. There seemed to be no response to this,
</p>
<p>and, noticing the want of enthusiasm, he grasped his rifle and made a motion
</p>
<p>to break it in two, calling them all at the same time cowards. He then left
</p>
<p>the hall. I was surprised at this, because among those assembled there
</p>
<p>were some of the worst Anarchists in the city, notably Lingg, Engel,
</p>
<p>Fischer and Grunewald. McCormick, however, is alive to-day. Rau

<p>notified those present that if any one wanted any bombs they should follow
</p>
<p>him to the Arbeiter-Zeitung office, and he would supply them. The meeting
</p>
<p>then adjourned.
</p>
<p>"After the experience I had thus had with the party, I was sorry that I
</p>
<p>ever joined. I found that what good humor I had formerly possessed had
</p>
<p>been completely wiped out by my associations with the revolutionary party.
</p>
<p>I wanted now to join some good society, and I thought of some good ex-
</p>
<p>cuse for leaving the party. My opportunity came. My comrades wanted
</p>
<p>me to buy a supply of ammunition, as the ist of May was near at hand, but
</p>
<p>I found that there was not money enough in the treasury. The financial
</p>
<p>secretary had been very slow in delivering to me all the money he had col-
</p>
<p>lected, and I discovered that his love for the shining dollars was so great
</p>
<p>that he would let some of them fall through his fingers. I found out his
</p>
<p>dishonesty, and I brought it to light. On this account we became enemies,
</p>
<p>and sometimes he would rather have seen me dead than McCormick. One
</p>
<p>evening I stood in front of the bar at Thalia Hall with him just before tar-
</p>
<p>get practice. I was talking about something not in his favor. We finally
</p>
<p>came to hot words and then to blows. I let him have a few right-handers,

</p>
<p>and he drew his revolver and fired one shot, the ball passing close to my
</p>
<p>right ear and striking the wall. The proprietor of the saloon' took the
</p>
<p>revolver away from him, and he attacked me again with a rawhide [a billy],
</p>
<p>which he always carried. He struck me over the head, and I grabbed a
</p>
<p>chair and gave it to him savagely. He skipped out. Shortly after this I
</p>
<p>sent the money-box with Schrader to the Verein along with my written
</p>
<p>resignation. In that I explained that I did not want to associate with
</p>
<p>murderers and manslayers. It was accepted, and I was again a free man,
</p>
<p>rejecting every inducement except one to join their ranks again. This ex-
</p>
<p>ception grew out of H
</p>
<p>my own foolishness
</p>
<p>and happened when
</p>
<p>I attended the ill-
</p>
<p>fated meeting of
</p>
<p>May 2d.
</p>
<p>" This meeting
</p>
<p>on May ad was held
</p>
<p>on Emma Street.
</p>
<p>During the day,
</p>
<p>which was a pleas-
</p>
<p>ant one, I went out
</p>
<p>early for a walk.
</p>
<p>While I was absent
</p>
<p>some one called at
</p>
<p>my house and told
</p>
<p>my wife that I was
</p>
<p>wanted at No. 63

<p>Emma Street that

<p>did not know the
</p>
<p>hall, nor knew the
</p>
<p>person who had no-
</p>
<p>tified my wife, I
</p>
<p>proceeded to the
</p>
<p>number given. This
</p>
<p>visit was a most un-
</p>
<p>fortunate one for me.
</p>
<p>Entering the hall, I
</p>
<p>noticed the Northwest Side group and the second company of the Lehr und
</p>
<p>Wehr Verein. I was just on the point of leaving, when Schrader called me
</p>
<p>back, and, not liking to act like a coward, I remained. A person named
</p>
<p>Kistner acted as chairman. They wanted to admit a member who had been
</p>
<p>proposed by two members as true and faithful, but Engel objected, and the
</p>
<p>man had to leave the hall. They then proceeded to business, having first
</p>
<p>ascertained that the twenty or twenty-five persons present were in perfect
</p>
<p>security. Engel took the floor and sailed into the capitalists and the police.
</p>
<p>He said that they should, when an opportunity presented itself, imitate the
</p>
<p>Anarchist leaders when, at the Bohemian Turner Hall masquerade ball, they

</p>
<p>had thrown pepper in the eyes of policemen who were present to make an
</p>
<p>attack on the turners, and he explained how that assault on their part had
</p>
<p>come very near costing him his life. But he had done it for the good of
</p>
<p>the cause. He then spoke of the labor troubles and said that now was the
</p>
<p>time to produce the revolution. It was unwise to let it pass. Then he
</p>
<p>proceeded to outline a plan for it, saying that, if any one had a better one
</p>
<p>to suggest, to say so. "
</p>
<p>Waller gives the details of the plan just as he gave it in court, and
</p>
<p>continues :
</p>
<p>"I could not advise any one to speak against the motion for the adop-
</p>
<p>tion of the plan, as he would have been dealt with accordingly. Breiten-
</p>
<p>feld stated subsequently at Thalia Hall that he would do everything in his
</p>
<p>power to carry out this plan and that he would not work for the next few
</p>
<p>days, and that on the day given he would be at No. 54 West Lake Street
</p>
<p>to make all the arrangements.
</p>
<p>"What happened on Monday at McCormick's is known. Spies hurried
</p>
<p>to write the ' Revenge ' circular, stating that six men had been killed, and
</p>
<p>put it into circulation. That day I was at No. 105 Wells Street, where the
</p>
<p>workingmen employed in Brunswick & Balke's factory held their meetings.
</p>
<p>I got home about six o'clock and had my supper, but I did not know then
</p>
<p>as to the conflict with the police at McCormick's. I did not feel like going
</p>
<p>to the meeting called for that evening at No. 54 West Lake Street. I had
</p>
<p>hardly been home thirty minutes when Clermont, of the second company,
</p>
<p>entered my room and asked :
</p>
<p>" ' Did you hear the news ? '
</p>
<p>"'What?' I asked.
</p>
<p>'" From McCormick's,' he replied.
</p>
<p>" ' What then ? ' I asked.
</p>
<p>" 'Ten men were killed by the police, and more than twenty wounded,'
</p>
<p>he said. ' Now we must commence.'
</p>
<p>"I did not believe it at first, but when he showed me the 'Revenge'
</p>
<p>circular my blood shot up into my head and I went with him to the meet-
</p>
<p>ing. As we passed Engel's house we met him and Fischer, and they
</p>
<p>joined us. On the way to the meeting, Engel said that if any one wanted

</p>
<p>to see him they should take the rear door and enter, as he thought the
</p>
<p>detectives were watching his house. Having arrived at the hall, Breiten-
</p>
<p>feld called the revolutionary men down to the cellar, and to my surprise I
</p>
<p>was elected chairman."
</p>
<p>Waller then details the business that was there transacted, the story
</p>
<p>being identical with that he gave on the witness-stand, and alludes to his
</p>
<p>visit to Engel's house on his way to the Haymarket meeting on the even-
</p>
<p>ing of May 4. He had been previously asked by A. Krueger, Kraemer,
</p>
<p>and two others, who called at his own house while he was eating his
</p>
<p>supper, to go with them to Wicker Park, as they wanted to be at their post
</p>
<p>in response to the signal " Ruhe," but he declined to go with them. Wal-
</p>
<p>ler continues :
</p>
<p>"I went to Engel's. He was not at home, and we waited in a room
</p>
<p>'behind the store. There were two others there, one a member of the
</p>
<p>MAN-AFRAID- OF-A-BL UE- CO A T. 297
</p>
<p>Northwest Side group, and the other I did not know. The first one went
</p>
<p>away to get some pepper, as he said, and returned again in a few minutes.
</p>
<p>. . . He said he was only waiting for the pills, meaning the bombs.
</p>
<p>I waited about five minutes, and during the time a young girl about ten or
</p>
<p>twelve years old put in an appearance, carrying a heavy parcel, which she
</p>
<p>handed to the man who had gone out for the pepper and who was waiting
</p>
<p>for 'pills.' I took the man to be her father. He disappeared behind a
</p>
<p>screen, and I walked out."
</p>
<p>Waller next gives the circumstances in connection with the Haymarket
</p>
<p>meeting precisely as he gave them in court, and reverts back to the meeting
</p>
<p>of Monday night at No. 54 Lake Street, referring to a speech made
</p>
<p>on that occasion by Clermont. That man, Waller says, spoke substantially
</p>
<p>as follows : " I expect to see about 20,000 or 25,000 people at the Hay
</p>
<p>market. The speeches should be very threatening and fierce so that the.
</p>
<p>police will be compelled to disperse the meeting. Then, when the police
</p>
<p>become engaged, we can carry out our purpose." Before this meeting came
</p>
<p>to order, Greif, the proprietor of the place, was around lighting the lamps,
</p>
<p>and while doing so he remarked, says Waller: "This is just the place for
</p>
<p>you conspirators."
</p>
<p>Among those expecting to do deeds of violence on the night of the Hay-
</p>
<p>market, at Wicker Park, was "Big" Krueger, and Waller mentions the fact
</p>
<p>that he met him the next day at noon.
</p>
<p>"Krueger show r ed me a revolver," says Waller, "and I told him that he
</p>
<p>had better leave it at home. He replied that he would not do it, as he
</p>
<p>intended to kill every one who came across his path, and he left. A few
</p>
<p>hours after he shot at a policeman and lost his life."
</p>
<p>Officer Madden was the officer thus assailed, and he immediately turned
</p>
<p>around and shot the Anarchist down in his tracks.
</p>
<p>In concluding his statement Waller refers to his arrest and says :
</p>
<p>" On the way to the station I made up my mind not to say a word.
</p>
<p>Arriving there, Capt. Schaack got to talking to me and put several ques-
</p>
<p>tions to me in the presence of several detectives. I noticed that telling lies
</p>
<p>would not do me any good, and the friendly and courteous treatment of the
</p>
<p>Captain made such an impression on my mind that I told, by and by, every-

</p>
<p>thing with a throbbing heart. I promised to repeat my statements before
</p>
<p>court, and I did so."
</p>
<p>OTTO LEHMAN was well known to the police by reputation through fre-
</p>
<p>quent mention of his name by fellow Anarchists, but he managed for some
</p>
<p>time to keep himself out of the way of a personal acquaintanceship with
</p>
<p>the force. He never did cherish admiration for policemen, and his dislike
</p>
<p>grew even more intense after he had learned that he was wanted. The
</p>
<p>sight of a blue-coat would drive him fairly wild, and the only way he could
</p>
<p>assuage his wrath was to take to his heels and run until his surcharged
</p>
<p>feelings had oozed out at the ends of his toes. He was a brave, defiant
</p>
<p>man in the presence of his comrades, and with his military bearing he
</p>
<p>2CJ8
</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>seemed the very personification of courage. He had a great penchant for
</p>
<p>lager beer, and, while emptying glass after glass, he talked Anarchy to the
</p>
<p>great delight of his hearers. He was an enthusiastic attendant at all meet-
</p>
<p>ings of the fraternity, and always wanted the speakers to make their har-
</p>
<p>angues strong and incendiary. If one of them failed to threaten capitalists
</p>
<p>with dynamite and guns, he lost interest in the proceedings. In that case
</p>
<p>he would tilt his chair back and take a nap. The moment some one rasped
</p>
<p>the air with stinging words against capitalists and the police, Lehman
</p>
<p>would be on his feet and applaud vociferously. He would then adjourn to
</p>
<p>a saloon, fill himself up with lager and go home to dream of happy days
</p>
<p>when everybody was to be rich without labor. Some nights he would jump
</p>
<p>up in bed half asleep, this is the story of his fellow roomers, and shout :
</p>
<p>" Down with them ; shoot them !
</p>
<p>Don't give them any quarter ! The world
</p>
<p>now is ours."
</p>
<p>His bed-companion, aroused by the
</p>
<p>demonstration, would take him by the
</p>
<p>collar and pull him down, after which he
</p>
<p>would sleep quite contentedly. This sort
</p>
<p>of exhibition was repeated after every
</p>
<p>meeting at which some new infernal
</p>
<p>machine had been spoken of, or some new
</p>
<p>torture for capitalists suggested. Such
</p>
<p>speeches made him strong in the faith, and
</p>
<p>so enthusiastic was he always that he
</p>
<p>managed to become quite a favorite with
</p>
<p>his fellows. In return for their admira-
</p>
<p>tion, he would spend his last. cent in buy-
</p>
<p>ing beer. His boarding-house was at No. 189 Hudson Avenue.
</p>
<p>Although this is only a two-story building, there were living in it at the
</p>
<p>time no less than eight families. That there were no more is no fault of
</p>
<p>the house. And such families ! Every one of them, from the youngest
</p>
<p>who could talk, to the oldest who could bear arms, was a turbulent Anar-

<p>chist. Lehman was always happy in such surroundings. Had he only had
</p>
<p>his wife and children there, his joy would have been as nearly complete as
</p>
<p>possible until all capitalists had been exterminated. Unfortunately his
</p>
<p>family were in Germany. He had left them there three years before. At
</p>
<p>that time he would have been pleased to bring them along with him had it
</p>
<p>not been for his haste to get out of Emperor William's dominions to escape
</p>
<p>the law of the land.
</p>
<p>In his new surroundings in America Lehman only waited for the day
</p>
<p>when millionaires would either "bite the dust" or capitulate by handing
</p>
<p>over their wealth to the Anarchists. He never for a moment doubted that

</p>
<p>From a Photograph.
</p>
<p>"AS GOOD A MAN AS GRANT." 299
</p>
<p>that day was almost at hand. Even after the Haymarket riot he had hope,
</p>
<p>but it vanished completely the moment he was within the grasp of the law.
</p>
<p>Of course, he did everything to save himself for another revolution by
</p>
<p>keeping away from the "hated police." Had it not been for his standing
</p>
<p>in Germany he would have returned there and waited until the excitement
</p>
<p>in Chicago had died out, and his comrades had fixed up 'another plan. He
</p>
<p>would have even gone to Canada, but he had never heard of it as a refuge
</p>
<p>for Anarchists. For a time he succeeded remarkably well in dodging us, as
</p>
<p>we had only a meager description of his appearance ; but on the 2oth of
</p>
<p>May he was seen by Officers Schuettler and Hoffman on the North Side.
</p>
<p>They did not know him at the time. Lehman, however, apears to have
</p>
<p>been suspicious of their movements, as there had recently been many
</p>
<p>inquiries for him in the locality. The moment Hoffman caught a glimpse
</p>
<p>of the slippery Anarchist, he remarked to his comrade :
</p>
<p>"I'll bet that is one of the cut-throats. We'll take him in on general
</p>
<p>principles, and we can soon find out where he belongs."
</p>
<p>The officers gradually approached him, but Lehman, suspecting their
</p>
<p>intentions, at once started on the run. He had run only half a block when
</p>
<p>he was captured, put in irons and taken to the station. On his arrival, I
</p>
<p>asked him his name.
</p>
<p>"I'll tell you my name, and that is all," replied Lehman, in a surly
</p>
<p>mood and with an air of bravado. " I am not ashamed of my name, no
</p>
<p>matter if I am poor. I am as good a man as Grant. Now, don't trouble me
</p>
<p>any more. I am closed, and you cannot open me with a crow-bar. Look
</p>
<p>at me and tell the newspapers you have seen me. I am ready to be locked
</p>
<p>up."
</p>
<p>" Otto," said I, "you have a brother named August, and he has a son by
</p>
<p>the name of Paul. That boy is a very good runner, and at the Haymarket,
</p>
<p>May 4, he was going to run and carry the news to outside men. The boy
</p>
<p>did run, but not with news for the waiting men. He kept running until he
</p>
<p>got out of town, and I know where he is. You will have him with you in a
</p>
<p>few days. So good-by, Otto ; I will see you about the first of June. Offi-
</p>
<p>cers, lock him up."
</p>
<p>Otto was accordingly escorted down stairs. He had no sooner b^een

<p>placed in a cell than the officers learned the location of his boarding-house
</p>
<p>at the number given. They at once repaired to the place and gave it a thor-
</p>
<p>ough overhauling. They learned that immediately after the Haymarket,
</p>
<p>and especially since officers had been frequently noticed in the locality,
</p>
<p>many of the occupants had disappeared in a great hurry, some even forget-
</p>
<p>ting the clean linen that hung in their back yards, and others neglecting to
</p>
<p>square their board bills.
</p>
<p>The officers searched the premises and found several loaded dynamite
</p>
<p>bombs, some showing conclusively that they had come from Lingg's factory.
</p>
<p>300 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>It was subsequently learned that Lingg had furnished them to Lehman
</p>
<p>one on the evening of May 4, at 58 Clybourn Avenue, and another shortly
</p>
<p>after, on the same street, near Larrabee. The bombs were all ready for
</p>
<p>use, and contained Lingg's extra strong explosive, almost doubly as power-
</p>
<p>ful as the ordinary commercial dynamite.
</p>
<p>Two days after his arrest, about eleven o'clock, Lehman was not in a
</p>
<p>very happy frame of mind. His dreams had not been pleasant, and the pos-
</p>
<p>sibility of hanging haunted him continually. He told the janitor that he
</p>
<p>wanted to see the Captain. I sent back word that I could not see him until
</p>
<p>the next day. Again in the afternoon he sent the janitor to say that he must
</p>
<p>see me at once, and that he would not speak so defiantly as he had done
</p>
<p>before. Otto was thereupon brought up. As he came in, he took off his
</p>
<p>hat and apologized for his rude behavior. After inviting the Anarchist to
</p>
<p>take a seat, I remarked :
</p>
<p>"You know what you are arrested for?"
</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," he replied.
</p>
<p>" Have you made up your mind, then, as to what you wish to say? "
</p>
<p>He answered in the affirmative.
</p>
<p>" Will you tell me all you know of the Anarchists ever since you became
</p>
<p>one of them ? "
</p>
<p>Assent being given, I continued : "Now, you must understand I know a
</p>
<p>great deal of this work myself."
</p>
<p>Otto said he so understood.
</p>
<p>"Well, I don't want you to lie to me, and I don't want you to lie about
</p>
<p>anybody else to benefit yourself. All you tell me must be true, and if I find
</p>
<p>that you conceal anything, I will consider you a liar and have nothing more
</p>
<p>to do with you."
</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," meekly and penitently replied Lehman, "I do agree with
</p>
<p>you on that point, and you will find me right. I will swear to all I say, and
</p>
<p>if I lie you can hang me in this station. But, Captain, I want something for
</p>
<p>telling the truth."
</p>
<p>"Well," I replied, "I will have the State's Attorney or his representa-
</p>
<p>tive here, and if he tells you to speak and promises to reward you, you can
</p>
<p>depend upon his word."

</p>
<p>In the presence of Assistant State's Attorney Furthmann, Otto at once
</p>
<p>unburdened his mind and related his knowledge of Anarchy in Chicago.
</p>
<p>He also testified to a fact, made apparent in my interviews with other pris-
</p>
<p>oners, that he, like others, had been carried away by " the d d Anarchist
</p>
<p>literature," as he expressed it, and that he now fully realized the utter folly
</p>
<p>of his past course. He had been told, he said, just as others had been told,
</p>
<p>by those who had lived in America for a long time, that this was a free coun-
</p>
<p>try, and there was no law to stop them. "You can see for yourself," they
</p>
<p>used to say to him, "they are all afraid of us. Nobody interferes with us.
</p>
<p>We have everything all our own way."
</p>
<p>OTTO LEHMAN'S "SQUEAL." 301
</p>
<p>"That sort of talk," said Lehman, "made me as bad as the rest of
</p>
<p>them."
</p>
<p>He had fully believed, as his friends had informed him, that it was legal
</p>
<p>to talk dynamite, and that they could form plans for murder with impunity
</p>
<p>and without molestation. Mr. Furthmann read and explained the law to
</p>
<p>him, when he said :
</p>
<p>" I am glad now that I have been arrested."
</p>
<p>And he demonstrated the sincerity of his statement by furnishing strong
</p>
<p>evidence against all the Anarchist leaders that he knew. He was kept in
</p>
<p>confinement until after the trial and then released by order of the State's
</p>
<p>Attorney. He was forty years of age, a carpenter by occupation, and ever
</p>
<p>since his release he has attended to work and means to live until a good
</p>
<p>age to make amends for his past life.
</p>
<p>The statement he gave me was as follows :'
</p>
<p>" I belong to the armed section of the International Carpenters' group.
</p>
<p>Whenever we had a meeting, the armed section remained five minutes
</p>
<p>later. To my group belonged myself, my brother, William Hageman,
</p>
<p>who lives on Rees Street, over Lehman's grocery store, also Hageman's
</p>
<p>brother, who was boarding at the same place, Ernst Niendorf, on Groger
</p>
<p>Street, Waller, William Seliger, John Thielen and Louis Lingg, all of the
</p>
<p>North Side group ; also Abraham Hermann, Lorenz Hermann, Ernst Hub-
</p>
<p>ner, Charley Bock and his brother, William Lange, Michael Schwab, Bal-
</p>
<p>thasar Rau, Rudolph Schnaubelt, Fischer and Huber. I attended a meet-
</p>
<p>ing, May 3, at 71 West Lake Street, at nine o'clock. I heard Louis Lingg
</p>
<p>speak there, also Schwab. I saw the circular there which called for revenge
</p>
<p>and to arms. Waller, or Zoller, opened the meeting as chairman. Lingg
</p>
<p>said at the meeting that they must arm themselves and attend the meeting
</p>
<p>at the Haymarket to get revenge for those workingmen who were killed at
</p>
<p>McCormick's factory that day by the police. I also heard Schwab urge them
</p>
<p>to arm themselves and seek revenge on the police. I heard one man call
</p>
<p>out that all armed men present should go to Greif's Hall, 54 West Lake
</p>
<p>Street, that a meeting would be held there in the basement. I went there,
</p>
<p>as also did my brother Gustav, the two Hagemans, Louis Lingg, Schnau-
</p>
<p>belt, Breitenfeld, John Thielen and Hubner. The meeting occurred at 54

<p>West Lake Street. I was there during the whole session. My brother was
</p>
<p>on the outside watching. I heard the speaker say that there would be a
</p>
<p>meeting at the Haymarket and that they expected a big crowd there, which
</p>
<p>would give them a chance to use their arms. He also said that the police
</p>
<p>would no doubt come there to disperse them. If they refused to go, the
</p>
<p>police would shoot, and they would have a good chance to shoot at them.
</p>
<p>The speakers at that meeting would be Spies, Fielden and Parsons. The
</p>
<p>North Side armed group would meet at Neff's Hall, 58 Clybourn Avenue,
</p>
<p>on Tuesday night, and they were to be ready with their arms and wait for
</p>
<p>orders. The Northwest Side group would also be ready and wait for
</p>
<p>orders. As soon as there was trouble at the Haymarket, they would be at
</p>
<p>Wicker Park ready for action. I heard the word ' Ruhe' spoken of at that
</p>
<p>meeting in the basement. If that word appeared in the paper the
</p>
<p>Arbeit er-Zeitung the next day, it would mean a revolution, and the attack
</p>
<p>on the police would be made that night. <Y, komme,' was a sign pub-
</p>
<p>302 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>lished in the Arbeiter-Zeitung, meaning that there would be a meeting of the
</p>
<p>armed men. When I saw that revenge circular at No. 71 West Lake
</p>
<p>Street, it excited me very much and brought me to the meeting at 54 West
</p>
<p>Lake Street. I saw Adolph Fischer at that meeting. He made an address
</p>
<p>to us calling us to arms and urged that we should take revenge on the
</p>
<p>capitalists and the officers who had killed our brother workingmen on that
</p>
<p>day at McCormick's. This man Fischer, whose picture has just been
</p>
<p>shown me by the Captain, is the person who said he would see that circulars
</p>
<p>were printed for the Haymarket meeting next day. The word ' Ruhe ' was
</p>
<p>our signal word, adopted by the meeting that night at 54 West Lake Street,
</p>
<p>to attack the police. I heard some one say at the meeting that we should
</p>
<p>also attack the police station-houses and the police who might be within.
</p>
<p>They should make dynamite bombs and have them ready to throw into the
</p>
<p>stations. Lingg said : ' I will have the dynamite and bombs ready to be
</p>
<p>used when called for.' I did not hear of any one else saying or offering to
</p>
<p>furnish dynamite bombs. I was about fifteen feet away from Lingg when
</p>
<p>he made the remark. Then I left the meeting and the hall. The unani-
</p>
<p>mous understanding among us all was that all who desired bombs must go
</p>
<p>to Lingg and get them. Arid we did not look to any one else for them. It
</p>
<p>was further stated at the meeting that, in case we should see a patrol wagon
</p>
<p>on the night of the attack, we should destroy the wagon, the horses and the
</p>
<p>officers, so that they could not render assistance to the officers at the Hay-
</p>
<p>market. On Tuesday evening, May 4, at nine o'clock, I went to Neff's Hall,
</p>
<p>58 Clybourn Avenue, and there I met both Hermanns, Rau, the Hagemans,
</p>
<p>Bock, Seliger and Lingg. Lingg gave me some of those long dynamite
</p>
<p>bombs and said : ' Here, you take this and use it.' He then started away.
</p>
<p>I heard that night Tuesday at eleven o'clock, at Ernst Grau's saloon, that
</p>
<p>there had been some shooting that night, that a bomb had been thrown and
</p>
<p>that many were killed and wounded at the Haymarket. A tall man came
</p>
<p>into Neff's Hall that night, May 4, at eleven o'clock, and told us about the
</p>
<p>shooting, the explosion of the bomb and the killing of the people. His clothes
</p>
<p>were all covered with mud, and he appeared greatly excited. He said :
</p>
<p>'You are having a good time here drinking beer. See how I look. I was
</p>
<p>over to the Haymarket and lost my revolvers.' His name is August. He

<p>is the man about thirty years of age, five feet ten inches tall, smooth face or
</p>
<p>a slight mustache, and is a bricklayer by occupation. [This was August
</p>
<p>Groge.] The dynamite bomb I had was made with a gas-pipe. My state-

<p>ment I will swear to at any time I am called upon."
</p>
<p>The bomb he speaks of was among those found by Officer Hoffman at
</p>
<p>No. 189 Hudson Avenue.
</p>
<p>GUSTAV LEHMAN was arrested on the same day May 20 with his
</p>
<p>brother Otto, only a little earlier in the morning. He was working as a
</p>
<p>carpenter, on a new building at the southwest corner of Sedgwick and
</p>
<p>Starr Streets, when Officers Schuettler and Hoffman accosted him, and his
</p>
<p>home at the time was at No. 41 Fremont Street, in the basement of a small
</p>
<p>building. He had a poor, sickly wife and six children. His wife, who
</p>
<p>subsequently died in the County Hospital, in July, 1888, when she was
</p>
<p>notified of his arrest, said :
</p>
<p>A WOMAN'S REMONSTRANCE.
</p>

</p>
<p>"Well, I am very sorry for my dear husband, but now my words are
</p>
<p>coming true. He would take the last cent out of the house and run to
</p>
<p>meetings every night. Instead of leaving the money at home to buy
</p>
<p>clothing with for the children and medicine for myself, he would spend the
</p>
<p>last cent in saloons. At times when I heard him and others talk about
</p>
<p>capitalists, about an equal division of everything, I thought it all very
</p>
<p>foolish, and I would tell my husband so. The only answer he would give
</p>
<p>me was :
</p>
<p>"'Oh, you old women don't know anything. You come to our meetings,
</p>
<p>and there you will be enlightened and learn how we are going to have
</p>
<p>things before long.'
</p>
<p>" I often told him, ' You will have things so that you all will be locked up
</p>
<p>and beg for mercy and be glad to go to work and let other people alone.'
</p>
<p>One day he didn't work ; he wanted to
</p>
<p>go to a meeting on the West Side. I
</p>
<p>reasoned with him and asked him to
</p>
<p>stay at home. I was afraid they would
</p>
<p>all be arrested for their foolish under-
</p>
<p>takings. Gustav got mad at me and
</p>
<p>said :
</p>
<p>" 'Now is our time or never. Before
</p>
<p>one month is over we will have things
</p>
<p>our own way. We have already got the
</p>
<p>capitalists, the militia and the police
</p>
<p>trembling in their boots. We are pre-
</p>
<p>pared, and, as soon as we strike the first
</p>
<p>blow, they will run away. Those that
</p>
<p>don't run we will kill. We don't expect
</p>
<p>to give them quarter. ' '
</p>
<p>The poor woman had clearly fore-
</p>
<p>seen the outcome, and with rare judg-
</p>
<p>ment and fine instinct, in spite of her lowly station in life, she had
</p>
<p>sought early and late to instill into her husband's mind some practical

</p>
<p>ideas of life. Within the limited lines of her observation she had grasped
</p>
<p>the problem of social existence, its struggles, its sufferings and its rewards,
</p>
<p>and she intuitively knew that such changes as her husband and others of his
</p>
<p>ilk desired could never be brought about by revolution in a free country.
</p>
<p>She loved her husband tenderly, and would have made any sacrifice for him.
</p>
<p>But he, rather than forego attendance at a single meeting, preferred that
</p>
<p>wife and children should surfer want. He kept his family in constant sus-
</p>
<p>pense and ranted like a madman.

<p>Lehman was a man about forty-five years of age, weighed two hundred

<p>pounds, and, although he had only the use of one eye, he was a good mechanic.

</p>
<p>When he was brought to the station he was asked his name.
</p>
<p>"I don't give any name," he answered, somewhat indignantly.
</p>
<p>"Why not? " asked I, in a pacific tone of voice.
</p>
<p>"Because," was the gruff answer, "I don't want anything to do with
</p>
<p>you. "
</p>
<p>" Oh, you don't. I am pleased to make your acquaintance. We don't
</p>
<p>find such a great man as you are every day. Officer, take this man to a
</p>
<p>safe place down stairs and leave him there until we want him again."
</p>
<p>"Well, you don't scare me any," thundered the burly Lehman.
</p>
<p>"Well, now, we don't want to scare you," retorted I pleasantly, "but I
</p>
<p>thought you needed rest. You won't feel so tired when you see us again.
</p>
<p>You will find more of your friends down stairs. If you talk to any one,
</p>
<p>you will be taken away from here and sent to the Desplaines Street Station."
</p>
<p>At the last remark Lehman winced perceptibly. The name of the Des-
</p>
<p>plaines Street Station grated harshly on his ear, and he evidently felt that I
</p>
<p>had some surprise in store for him. He could have lightly passed by any
</p>
<p>other thrusts, but this nettled him. It was made for a purpose. I knew
</p>
<p>that all Anarchists had an intense hatred for that station, and greater than
</p>
<p>their hatred of the place was their anger against Bonfield, who had charge
</p>
<p>of it. They would rather suffer torments anywhere else than be cast into
</p>
<p>a cell in that place.
</p>
<p>But Lehman shortly recovered his equanimity, and, assuming a stolid
</p>
<p>indifference to his surroundings, remarked :
</p>
<p>" If you think you can make me 'squeal,' you are badly mistaken."
</p>
<p>' ' Oh, no ; we don't want you to ' squeal, ' " said I. " We are rather afraid
</p>
<p>you will beg to be allowed to come here and sit on your knees to tell us all
</p>
<p>you know about making bombs and dynamite all about your meetings
</p>
<p>how often you have presided at meetings and how much dynamite you got from
</p>
<p>Lingg ; and to tell us all about your brother, and where your son is hiding
</p>
<p>now, and where you placed the bombs that you carried around in your
</p>
<p>pocket on May 4; how bad a headache you had after filling the bombs with
</p>
<p>dynamite at Seliger's house. You see, August, we simply want to call your
</p>
<p>attention to all these little things that's all."
</p>
<p>This charge proved a little too strong for the doughty Lehman. He had

</p>
<p>kept up his courage well, but the rapidity of the assault, the dark secrets
</p>
<p>hinted at and the insinuations made had taxed his powers of resistance
</p>
<p>almost beyond endurance. His facial muscles twitched, and for a moment
</p>
<p>he wrestled with himself. He asked for a glass of water, and, quaffing its
</p>
<p>contents to the last drop, he rallied and straightened himself as if deter-
</p>
<p>mined to hold out in spite of his nerves. Recovering his breath and strug-
</p>
<p>gling with his emotions, he said :
</p>
<p>" If you have the power to hang me, do so. I have belonged to the
</p>
<p>cause so long that I will die before I reveal anything."
</p>

</p>
<p>That was sufficient. Lehman was taken down stairs and locked up. The
</p>
<p>very next morning he sent the janitor to my office with a request to see me.
</p>
<p>I told the janitor that I was very busy and could not be interrupted unless
</p>
<p>Lehman had something very important to communicate. To this Lehman re-
</p>
<p>plied that he had discovered that there were other men locked up down
</p>
<p>stairs, and he was satisfied that if they had a chance they would "squeal."
</p>
<p>Would I accord him an interview? He was brought up,, and, in the pres-
</p>
<p>ence of Assistant State's Attorney Furthmann and the officers, proceeded to
</p>
<p>unfold a very remarkable tale. He began very cautiously, evidently follow-
</p>
<p>ing the instructions laid down in John Host's book for Anarchists in trouble,
</p>
<p>but, as the questions were plied upon him, he soon discovered that he was in
</p>
<p>a very "tight box." He finally asked if there was any prospect of his be-
</p>
<p>ing hung. He was informed that he must tell all he knew, and all must be
</p>
<p>true ; that we did not want him to try to lie himself out of his trouble or tell
</p>
<p>a falsehood against an innocent man. Probably he would be called on to
</p>
<p>testify in court, and, of course, if he was a witness for the State, he would
</p>
<p>not be hanged.
</p>
<p>" I do trust you men," he said, and revealed all the secrets that he knew,
</p>
<p>without reserve as to his own deeds and the experiences he had had with the
</p>
<p>other Anarchists. His statement gave the officers important points.
</p>
<p>After the trial, Lehman declared he had no more use for Anarchy. He
</p>
<p>became a good husband and a kind father. In 1889 he married again, and,,
</p>
<p>strange to say, Officer Nordrum acted as ' best man " at the ceremony.
</p>
<p>The nature of Gustav's testimony appears in the evidence he gave at the
</p>
<p>trial.
</p>
<p>ABRAHAM HERMANN was a man of different temperament ; but, after his
</p>
<p>arrest, he showed a somewhat similar disposition as to secretiveness and
</p>
<p>stubbornness. He was arrested on the evening of May 10 at eight o'clock.
</p>
<p>He lived at No. 25 Clybourn Avenue. He was about thirty-four years of
</p>
<p>age, medium build, and weighed about 185 pounds. He was of dark com-
</p>
<p>plexion, wore a full black beard, had sharp, piercing eyes, and from think-
</p>
<p>ing much on Anarchy, had come to present a sickly appearance. He did
</p>
<p>not look at all vicious, however, and was very quiet in his manner. He was
</p>
<p>a good machinist and fully conversant with the German language. In con-
</p>

<p>versation he was slow and deliberate, evidently thinking twice before speak-
</p>
<p>At the time Abraham was taken in charge, his brother Lorenz was also
</p>
<p>arrested. Abraham's house had been searched a week before, and two
</p>
<p>rifles had been found and taken to the station. When the officers met the
</p>
<p>brothers, they were told to come to the station to identify their property,
</p>
<p>and when they set foot inside my office they were notified that they were
</p>
<p>under arrest. They manifested no surprise. Abraham was asked if he had
</p>
<p>anything to say. He wanted to know what about, and when informed that
</p>
<p>306 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>we wanted information about Anarchy, he slowly replied that he "did not
</p>
<p>know any Anarchists."
</p>
<p>"You can probably tell us something about how to drill Anarchists and
</p>
<p>how much profit you made on the rifles, or the 44-caliber Remington
</p>
<p>revolvers ; or perhaps tell us how many men you had in your command on

<p>the night of the 4th of May around this station, and tell us about the

<p>the explosion of the bomb at the Haymarket. "
</p>
<p>I could have put a few more queries, but I stopped to watch the effect.
</p>
<p>Abraham's eyes bulged out for a moment in surprise, but not a word did he
</p>
<p>have to say. He was at once locked up, and for nearly three days betrayed
</p>
<p>no signs of weakening. On the third day he showed a little anxiety and
</p>
<p>expressed a desire to see me. He was brought up, but, getting into a com-
</p>
<p>fortable room, where the light of day made all surroundings cheerful, he
</p>
<p>became rather buoyant and seemed loth to depress the spirits of others
</p>
<p>by unfolding harrowing tales of Anarchistic plots. I tried to engage him

<p>in conversation, but the answers came in monosyllables and with a sort of

</p>
<p>guttural emphasis. The situation was becoming very tiresome. I thought
</p>
<p>Abraham had suddenly been seized with the lockjaw, but determined to
</p>
<p>fathom the man's mind. I urged him not to be guided by Most's book,
</p>
<p>we understood that, but to speak out if he had any information to give.
</p>
<p>If he had nothing to impart, to say so. He promptly saw that the situa-
</p>
<p>tion was growing critical, and that, if he still refrained from speaking,
</p>
<p>possibly his last chance for saving himself might be gone. He relaxed the
</p>
<p>muscles of his face, opened his lips and prepared to talk. It was a great
</p>
<p>effort, but he evidently realized that something must be done.
</p>
<p>"Well," he finally drawled out, "I don't know what to tell you. It
</p>
<p>seems to me you people know about everything and have things down as
</p>
<p>correctly as I can give them to you. And you know all about me, too. I
</p>
<p>say this for myself : I don't know anything about the laws of the country.
</p>
<p>I have been told by people that ought to know better, that for what we
</p>
<p>were doing there was no law. I now see my mistake."
</p>
<p>Hermann then gave information on himself and others, and stated that
</p>
<p>he had never liked Lingg. Lingg, he remarked, was the most rabid Anar-
</p>
<p>chist he had ever seen, and he almost believed that the man had a dyna-
</p>
<p>mite bomb in his head. He himself had never had anything to say in
</p>
<p>favor of the use of dynamite. He was a military man, and believed in the
</p>
<p>use of rifles. He had held that all the Anarchists should be well drilled
</p>
<p>and that no man should carry arms unless he knew how to use them. He
</p>
<p>was opposed to throwing stones or fighting in the streets. He believed in
</p>
<p>swords and good riflemen, and he was one of that class. His idea was
</p>
<p>never to undertake anything until fully prepared, and when they were pre-
</p>
<p>pared to let their work show the result.
</p>
<p>During the interview he was very cautious in his statements, but he did
</p>
<p>not spare the leaders. At the same time he would not implicate any one
</p>
<p>of no special consequence in the order. His statement, however, was as
</p>
<p>sweeping as it was surprising. He was implicity believed by the officers,
</p>
<p>as candor and earnestness were manifest in his disclosures.
</p>
<p>Hermann was indicted by the grand jury, but after he had been in custody
</p>
<p>for awhile he was released by order of the State's Attorney. At the beginning
</p>
<p>of the trial he was brought in again and confined until its termination. He

</p>
<p>was then given his liberty. He has since become an industrious man, and
</p>
<p>has only had two or three relapses by attending some of the open, public
</p>
<p>meetings. He now declares, however, that he is through with Anarchy.
</p>
<p>What he had to say to Assistant State's Attorney Furthmann, myself and
</p>
<p>the officers was this :
</p>
<p>"I have belonged to the North Side armed group since 1883. The
</p>
<p>members of the group are as follows : Schwab, Rau, Huber, Neebe, the
</p>
<p>two Lehmans, Thielen, Lingg, Hubner, Seliger, Lange, Schnaubelt, Lorenz
</p>
<p>Hermann, Abraham Hermann, the two Hagemans, Heyman, Niendorf and

</p>
<p>Charley Bock. We were about forty men strong on the North Side. I do
</p>
<p>not know anything about the word ' Ruhe.' On Monday, May 3, at 9 P.M.,
</p>
<p>I attended a meeting of the metal-workers at Seamen's Hall, on Randolph,
</p>
<p>near Jefferson Street. I saw August Spies. He was passing and handing
</p>
<p>out some of the circulars that called for revenge upon the law and the
</p>
<p>police. Spies was at the meeting when I got there, and he had a handful of
</p>
<p>those circulars. I saw Spies busying himself around the meeting talking
</p>
<p>to the people. The secretary of this meeting was a man named Hahne-
</p>
<p>man. Lange was president. I belong to the North Side branch of the
</p>
<p>same union. But this was a general meeting. I only knew a few of the
</p>
<p>members present. The president of the meeting works for a firm on
</p>
<p>Wabash Avenue a brass-finisher named Andrew or Andre. When I left
</p>
<p>this meeting at ten o'clock I went to 54 West Lake Street. As I came into
</p>
<p>the saloon some one said that there was a meeting down stairs. I went
</p>
<p>down Waller was president of that meeting. I also saw Fischer there.
</p>
<p>I know Schnaubelt. He was there. When the question came up about
</p>
<p>printing the circulars for the Haymarket meeting, Fischer said that he
</p>
<p>would see to it. Some one suggested that letters should be sent to the
</p>
<p>armed people or members in surrounding cities near Chicago, asking them
</p>
<p>to attend to the police and militia there, so that they could not come to the
</p>
<p>assistance of the officers or police of this city. On my opposition the prop-
</p>
<p>osition was dropped. I saw Hubner and Lingg at that meeting. As I
</p>
<p>came in some one said, 'Lingg is going to attend to that.' I understood
</p>
<p>it to mean furnishing the dynamite bombs. I saw the meeting was intended
</p>
<p>for mischief, and I left the place. At a meeting May 4, at 8:30 P.M., in
</p>
<p>the hall in the rear of Neff's saloon, 58 Clybourn Avenue, I heard that the
</p>
<p>plan of operation decided upon was the same as given to the armed men at
</p>
<p>54 West Lake Street. So far as I remember the plan, it was something like
</p>
<p>this : Some of the armed men were to go to the police stations, and, if the
</p>
<p>police were called out, to throw dynamite bombs among them, set the houses
</p>
<p>on fire and keep the police on the North Side. As far as I know, the North-
</p>
<p>west Side group had a similar plan. Lingg was not there at this time.
</p>
<p>All members present were anxious to see him come, waiting for bombs. I
</p>
<p>was in the hall about an hour. I went back again the same evening May

</p>
<p>4 about eleven o'clock. The first I heard of any trouble was about 10:30.
</p>
<p>A man whose name is Anton Hirschberger came into the saloon and told
</p>
<p>us that there had been a riot at the Haymarket. At the same time a tall
</p>
<p>man came in and said he had been at the riot, that a lot of bullets flew
</p>
<p>around them, a bomb had exploded, and that either some one had stolen his
</p>
<p>revolver or he had lost it. Then Neff said he was going to close up his
</p>
<p>place, the hour being eleven o'clock. On Wednesday, May 5, I met Lingg
</p>
<p>and Seliger at that place. I was surprised at meeting Lingg there, because
</p>
<p>I thought then that he ought to have been locked up. Lingg spoke to me
</p>
<p>and said, 'You are nice cowards.' I replied that he had better keep his
</p>
<p>mouth shut, as he was the cause of the whole affair. Hubner and I were
</p>
<p>there to attend a meeting of our people to be held on the quiet in Lincoln
</p>
<p>Park. We were to meet at the park because we expected it would not be
</p>
<p>safe to hold it anywhere else. What led me to think that Lingg ought to have
</p>
<p>been locked up was because he was always advocating the use of dynamite
</p>
<p>and bombs. That a bomb had been thrown was a fact, and I thought Lingg
</p>
<p>ought to have been arrested for it."

<p>ABRAHAM HERMANN'S STORY.

</p>
<p>On May 31, Hermann made another statement, as follows :
</p>
<p>" I know August Spies. He is the editor of the Arbeiter-Zeitung of this
</p>
<p>city. I knew him to write several articles on revolution. I was elected as
</p>
<p>an agent at a general meeting to procure and sell arms. This was in Octo-
</p>
<p>ber last 1885. Balthasar Rau was chairman of that meeting. We had
</p>
<p>several men as a committee. They were called the Bureau of Information.
</p>
<p>It was composed of Parsons, from the English section ; Charles Bock, Ger-
</p>
<p>man, also assistant secretary to Rau ; Hirschberger, French, and Miko-
</p>
<p>landa, Bohemian. Every Anarchist looked to that bureau for information.
</p>
<p>I used to get my guns from New York, from a man named Seeger. He lives
</p>
<p>on Third Avenue. He was the middleman between me and the factory
</p>
<p>where the arms were
</p>
<p>made. I got twenty-
</p>
<p>five revolvers last
</p>
<p>February. They were
</p>
<p>shipped direct to me
</p>
<p>at No. 25 Clybourn
</p>
<p>Avenue. I sold them
</p>
<p>all at cost price to
</p>
<p>members. That was
</p>
<p>$6.50. The last two
</p>
<p>revolvers I sold May
</p>
<p>3, 1886 one to a
</p>
<p>man named Asher,
</p>
<p>and the other to
</p>
<p>August, a bricklayer.
</p>
<p>Before that I sold one
</p>
<p>revolver to Schnau-
</p>
<p>belt, one to Lingg
</p>
<p>and one to Seliger.
</p>
<p>It was Schnaubelt
</p>
<p>who proposed at the
</p>
<p>meeting held at 54.

</p>
<p>^T May 3, to notify out-
</p>

</p>
<p>him it was all non-
</p>
<p>sense. About two
</p>
<p>weeks before this

<p>tenfeld in a saloon, and said that I had often heard this letter ' Y,' and I was
</p>
<p>bound to find out its meaning when it appeared in the Arbeiter-Zeitung.
</p>
<p>Breitenfeld said that it meant a meeting of the armed men, and told me to
</p>
<p>wait and he would get me into the meeting. I waited for a long time
</p>
<p>about an hour. Then he came out, and I was admitted with him. I was
</p>
<p>in the meeting with him for an hour, and then it adjourned. I have known
</p>
<p>Lingg for six months. At the meeting at 54 West Lake Street on the
</p>
<p>evening of May 3, it was supposed then that the police would interfere
</p>
<p>at the Haymarket, and then there would be a chance for a riot. Four
</p>
<p>members of the North Side group were detailed at that meeting as spies.
</p>
<p>If the riot should be a failure and we should get beaten by the police, our
</p>
<p>gathering-places after that would be at Center Park, Humboldt Park, St.

</p>
<p>Michael's Church, Lincoln Park and Wicker Park. The signal of attack
</p>
<p>after the riot had commenced was to be an illumination of the heavens by
</p>
<p>red fires. Some one asked for dynamite, and he was answered that Lingg
</p>
<p>would furnish the stuff. The different spies detailed at that meeting were
</p>
<p>to hold a meeting the next day, each division for itself, and afterwards in
</p>
<p>a body at Zepf's Hall, to perfect all arrangements for the riot. I accused
</p>
<p>Lingg of making dynamite bombs, and told him that if any trouble grew
</p>
<p>out of it, it would be on his account. He called me a coward. I knew
</p>
<p>that Lingg was in trouble in Philadelphia shortly before he left there."
</p>
<p>LOREXZ HERMANN was twenty-six years of age, of slim build, with a very
</p>
<p>sallow face, and apparentlx* a consumptive. His occupation was that of a
</p>
<p>brass-molder, and he was a good workman. On his arrival at the station he
</p>
<p>expressed great surprise at the impudence of the officers in compelling him
</p>
<p>to come against his wilL He was asked his name, and he gave it. When
</p>
<p>requested to spell it, he said he did not know how ; all he knew was that it
</p>
<p>was Lorenz Hermann. Being questioned with reference to Anarch}*, he re-
</p>
<p>plied that he did not know anything about it, and when accused of having
</p>
<p>taken part in the revolutionary plot, he said he had not taken as great a part
</p>
<p>in it as his brother had. He soon discovered that the police had a great
</p>
<p>deal of information about his brother, and then he changed his tactics by
</p>
<p>trying to smooth things over for Abraham.
</p>
<p>"My brother," he said, "is married and has a f amily. I am single. I
</p>
<p>want to see my brother out of this trouble ; no matter about me."
</p>
<p>"Well, then," I interposed, "why not tell us something? "
</p>
<p>"Me ? " asked Lorenz. " I don't know anything to tell."
</p>
<p>He had evidently changed his mind on the spur of the moment, and he
</p>
<p>grew exceedingly reticent.
</p>
<p>" Well," said I, " I will tell you something then. I will call your attention
</p>
<p>to May 4, between the hours of 8:30 and 10:30 P.M. You were around this
</p>
<p>station with about nineteen other men, and among them was your brother.
</p>
<p>You were to throw bombs into the patrol wagon in case the police were
</p>
<p>called out to go to the West Side to assist the police at the Haymarket, but
</p>
<p>you remained a little too long in a saloon on Clark Street. When you came
</p>
<p>out and reached the corner of Superior Street and La Salle Avenue, you saw

<p>three patrol wagons loaded with police going south on LaSalle Avenue, but
</p>
<p>3 r ou were not near enough to throw a bomb. This made you very angry.
</p>
<p>Then some of you went to Moody 's church and remained there for some
</p>
<p>time. When you finally saw so many policemen coming to the station you
</p>
<p>all got scared and went to the hall at 58 Clybourn Avenue. Oh, by the way,
</p>
<p>which route did you take on leaving the station? Did you go to the Hay-
</p>
<p>market or to Neff's Hall ? "
</p>
<p>"I was at the Haymarket," replied Lorenz.
</p>
<p>" Is it not true all that I told you about the station ?"
</p>
<p>"Yes, that is true," responded Lorenz. "Some one told me about it."

</p>
<p>"Who told you?"
</p>
<p>" I don't know."
</p>
<p>"You lie," said I. " You must tell us who ; that is the man we are after."
</p>
<p>Seeing that he was gradually being cornered by his evasive replies, he
</p>
<p>put on a bold front to the whole matter and answered :
</p>
<p>" Well, I was there myself. I did not stay very long, and from there I
</p>
<p>went to the Haymarket. I think Hageman and I went together."
</p>
<p>Further questioning only brought out sullen responses, with very meager
</p>
<p>information, but, after being allowed to think the matter over, he finally
</p>
<p>concluded to make a clean breast of it. He was kept busy with explana-
</p>
<p>tions for some time, and he gave me some very pointed information. He
</p>
<p>was indicted by the grand jury and afterwards released by order of the
</p>
<p>State's Attorney. Lorenz has never been heard of since, but it is supposed
</p>
<p>he is now leading a quiet life and proving himself a better man.
</p>
<p>His statement, among other things corroborative of what others had
</p>
<p>divulged, contains the following :
</p>
<p>" At a meeting held at 58 Clybourn Avenue, I heard Engel say that
</p>
<p>if they wanted to make bombs they could find plenty of gas-pipe on the
</p>
<p>West Side, in the city yards, near the Chicago Avenue bridge, and then if
</p>
<p>they wanted to learn how to make them they could come to him. All that
</p>
<p>was necessary was to cut the pipes up into lengths of six or eight inches,
</p>
<p>fill them with dynamite and put a wooden plug at each end. He had with
</p>
<p>him at the time his daughter, who was about fifteen or sixteen years of age.
</p>
<p>I saw Hirschberger, Hageman and Charles Bock at eleven o'clock on the
</p>
<p>evening of Tuesday, May 4, in Neff's place, at 58 Clybourn Avenue. Hirsch-
</p>
<p>berger told those present about the riot on the W T est Side. I was at the
</p>
<p>Haymarket meeting in the company of Hageman, the carpenter. Two men
</p>
<p>stood close together near me, and they looked suspicious. I was there at
</p>
<p>the time the police came up. I got frightened and ran away. I ran with-
</p>
<p>out stopping till I reached Neff's place, on the North Side. I found my
</p>
<p>brother there, and I told him about the throwing of the bomb, its explosion
</p>
<p>and what happened. I did not want to get mixed up in the affair, and that
</p>
<p>is the reason I declined to speak at first. I belonged to the armed men of

</p>
<p>THE Anarchists, both in and out of prison, had begun to discover about
</p>
<p>this time that there was a law in the land, and that its majesty would
</p>
<p>be vindicated. They were confronted with stubborn, serious facts, and
</p>
<p>they realized that they were in a world of perplexities. They had been
</p>
<p>circumvented at every step in their efforts at concealment, and their plot
</p>
<p>had been revealed in its most essential parts. Their leaders had been
</p>
<p>gathered in, and their comrades were being arrested every day. Cunning
</p>
<p>and shrewd as they supposed themselves to be, they had discovered that
</p>
<p>society was equal to the task of probing their secrets. At first they had
</p>
<p>assumed an air of bravado and indifference, but, seeing how easily their
</p>
<p>bluff could be called and how closely we had the record of each, they real-
</p>
<p>ized that evasion or silence was not calculated either to keep their necks
</p>
<p>out of the halter or to save them from the penitentiary. Those arrested
</p>
<p>nearly all turned craven cowards, and this situation of affairs did not con-
</p>
<p>tribute to the comfort of those still outside, who were in momentary dread
</p>
<p>of apprehension. Arrest followed arrest, and Mr. Furthmann and I were
</p>
<p>kept exceedingly busy in directing the taking of confessions and assimilat-
</p>
<p>ing the material for future use. Still the good work went on.
</p>
<p>The first victim, after the Hermann brothers, to fall under police control
</p>
<p>was Herman Muntzenberg. He was arrested on the evening of May 20,
</p>
<p>at eight o'clock, and the circumstances attending his arrest were somewhat
</p>
<p>peculiar. On the evening in question, Officers Schuettler and Hoffman
</p>
<p>were transferring the Hermann brothers from the Larrabee Street Station
</p>
<p>to the Chicago Avenue Station. They boarded an open street-car with
</p>
<p>their prisoners, whom they placed on a rear seat facing front, stationing

</p>
<p>themselves immediately behind on the platform. In the middle of the car,
</p>
<p>facing to the rear, sat a stranger. Presently the officers noticed that the
</p>
<p>man was making signs to the Hermanns. In response, Lorenz Hermann
</p>
<p>placed his right hand over his mouth. This was followed by another sign
</p>
<p>from the stranger. Officer Schuettler recognized the fact that the man
</p>
<p>was a friend of the Hermanns, and he requested the prisoners not to divulge
</p>
<p>the officers' identity. The stranger seemed to be in doubt about some-
</p>
<p>ARREST ON A STREET-CAR.
</p>
<p>thing, left his seat, and, placing himself at the side of Abraham Hermann,
</p>
<p>started a conversation. He appeared to be an old acquaintance. This
</p>
<p>was sufficient for the officers. When the car reached the corner of Wells
</p>
<p>Street and Chicago Avenue, the stranger was about to leave. He was
</p>
<p>quietly told by the officers not to trouble himself just then to get off the car,
</p>
<p>but to keep his seat a little while longer. Naturally the man was surprised
</p>
<p>at this request of men whom he did not know, and indignantly declined to
</p>
<p>ride any farther. The officers promptly told him to consider himself under
</p>
<p>arrest and not to move if he valued his life. They had in the meantime recog-
</p>
<p>nized the man as the little fellow who had carried the satchel filled with
</p>
<p>dynamite bombs to Neff's Hall, along with
</p>
<p>Lingg. It was Herman Muntzenberg.
</p>
<p>The three prisoners were taken to the
</p>
<p>station, and Muntzenberg was locked up
</p>
<p>by himself over night. The next day he
</p>
<p>was brought into my office. The density
</p>
<p>of his ignorance respecting Anarchy or
</p>
<p>Anarchists was astonishing. Like the rest,
</p>
<p>he absolutely knew nothing. Some days
</p>
<p>afterwards, however, he took a different
</p>
<p>view of things. A confession was looked
</p>
<p>for, and he was given an opportunity.
</p>
<p>" I see everybody is in trouble," Munt-
</p>
<p>zenberg began dolefully. " I am in for it
</p>
<p>myself. I cannot help anybody; nobody
</p>
<p>can help me."
</p>
<p>He hesitated, as if trying to decide
</p>
<p>what he should do, but finally, nerving
</p>
<p>himself, he continued :
</p>
<p>" I will bear my own trouble. I will hurt no one else."
</p>
<p>"Ah," said I, "there is Hermann, for instance ; there are other people also
</p>
<p>who have given you away. They have all professed to be your friends in
</p>
<p>times past, and now they are trying to save their own necks and hang you.
</p>
<p>So you want to remain silent under their charges ? Have you nothing to tell

<p>on the others? "
</p>
<p>" That would do me no good," answered Muntzenberg.
</p>
<p>"Then," said I, " what have you to say about yourself ? "
</p>
<p>"You don't know the least thing about me," defiantly remarked the little
</p>
<p>man.
</p>
<p>" Probably you had such a bad headache from the smell of dynamite that
</p>
<p>you can't remember anything."
</p>
<p>"Who told you I had a headache ? " broke in Muntzenberg, now intensely
</p>
<p>interested.

</p>
<p>"Were you not afraid," I continued, not heeding the interruption, "that
</p>
<p>you would fall into the basement when you sat on the iron railing at the corner
</p>
<p>of North Avenue and Larrabee Street, near the police station, or did you
</p>
<p>feel confident that the bombs you had in your pocket would hold you in your
</p>
<p>place? Another thing you are not in the habit of smoking cigars. Did
</p>
<p>they make you sick ? "
</p>
<p>Muntzenberg had remained somewhat passive up to this last shot, but he
</p>
<p>suddenly showed there was a good deal of vitality in him. His eyes flashed
</p>
<p>with excitement, and he was all attention.
</p>
<p>" By the way, " I went on, " how much weight can you carry ? "
</p>
<p>"What do you mean? " interposed the anxious listener.
</p>
<p>" I mean how much did that gray satchel weigh that you carried to 58 Cly-
</p>
<p>bourn Avenue May 4, about eight o'clock ? "
</p>
<p>" D n the informers," ejaculated the now irate little Anarchist. " Give
</p>
<p>me an hour to think matters over and call me again. "
</p>
<p>He was sent back to his cell, and on the expiration of two hours he was
</p>
<p>brought back. He entered the office very meekly, and at once said :
</p>
<p>" Captain, I see it is no use for me to be stubborn. Will you treat me like
</p>
<p>the others, if I tell all I have seen and what I have done myself ? "
</p>
<p>" I promise you the same right and privilege."
</p>
<p>Muntzenberg made his statement and was released by order of the State's
</p>
<p>Attorney. He was a German, twenty-eight years old, five feet seven inches
</p>
<p>tall, stoutly built, with large head and eyes, and followed the trade of a
</p>
<p>blacksmith. At the time of his arrest he lived at No. 95 North Wells
</p>
<p>Street. On his release he promised to testify whenever wanted, but about
</p>
<p>the middle of the trial he took a leave of absence and has never been seen
</p>
<p>since. Once it was reported that he was dead, but the report could not be
</p>
<p>verified. Muntzenberg was a warm admirer of Lingg, Spies and Engel,
</p>
<p>and a persistent woiker for their cause. He often lost several days' work in
</p>
<p>a week to saunter out into the country, selling Most's books and telling people
</p>
<p>to arm themselves. He earned good wages when he worked, and spent it
</p>
<p>all for Anarchy. Like others, he acknowledged that he had been led astray
</p>
<p>by incendiary literature. His statement was as follows:
</p>
<p>"On May 4, about eight o'clock, I was sent to meet two men who

<p>carried a satchel filled with dynamite shells or bombs. I met them about
</p>
<p>a block from Thiiringer Hall, 58 Clybourn Avenue. I told them that I had
</p>
<p>been asked to meet them and help carry the satchel. They said, 'All. right.'
</p>
<p>I took it from them, put it on my shoulder and carried it to the hall. The
</p>
<p>satchel weighed about thirty pounds. In the afternoon of that day, about
</p>
<p>four o'clock, I came to the North Side and went to Hubner's house, No. n
</p>
<p>Mohawk Street. He was not at home. I went out to look for him. I have
</p>
<p>known him for some time. I found him. The second time I wanted to
</p>
<p>see him I went to his house and found him at home in his room making
</p>
<p>transparencies for that night's meeting at the Haymarket. He took lunch
</p>
<p>then, and after that we went to Seliger's house, No. 442 Sedgwick Street.
</p>
<p>MUNTZENBERG'S NARRA TIVE. 3 1 5
</p>
<p>Reaching there, Hubner told Lingg and Seliger that I was his friend and
</p>
<p>all right. In the room of Lingg I saw two guns and two revolvers. Seli-
</p>
<p>ger was filling the bombs with dynamite. Lingg was cutting the fuse.
</p>
<p>One of them asked me if I had any sores on my hand. I said no. 'Then,'
</p>
<p>they said, 'you can help us.' My task was to fill in with dynamite the
</p>
<p>long gas-pipe shells. I filled six or eight shells or bombs. My head com-
</p>
<p>menced to ache from the smell of the dynamite, so that I could not work
</p>
<p>any longer. Hubner also worked, putting caps on the fuse. I saw three
</p>
<p>or four men in the house at the time. I saw about ten round lead bombs on
</p>
<p>the bed, all empty. After they were finished they were put under the bed. I
</p>
<p>noticed about sixteen of the long gas-pipe shells or bombs about the room.
</p>
<p>At dark Hubner and I went to Neff's Hall. Before leaving I saw one of
</p>
<p>the two, Lingg or Seliger, bring in a satchel and empty it of dirty clothes.
</p>
<p>As we were approaching the hall, Hubner asked me to see if they were
</p>
<p>coming. I went to see, and met them in the alley near the street. Both
</p>
<p>were carrying the satchel, each having hold of the ends of the handles on
</p>
<p>the satchel. I asked if I should help them. They answered yes. As they
</p>
<p>were tall men, I could not carry it with either one, and so I put it on my
</p>
<p>shoulder and carried it myself. I took it into the rear hall back of the
</p>
<p>saloon. After a little while one of them asked me where I had placed the
</p>
<p>satchel. I told him. He said that was not the right place and asked me
</p>
<p>to bring it back. So I went after it and put it into the narrow hall-way.
</p>
<p>The satchel was two feet long, eighteen inches high and sixteen inches
</p>
<p>wide. It was covered with gray canvas. It weighed about thirty pounds.
</p>
<p>When I left Seliger's house at dark, I took along with me three long bombs.
</p>
<p>I did so because one of the men there told me to do so. I knew they were
</p>
<p>bombs in the satchel when I carried them. Some one passed us on the
</p>
<p>street as we were going to the hall. Lingg said : ' Those are heavy tools,'
</p>
<p>meaning the contents of the satchel, to throw the party we met off his
</p>
<p>guard. I threw the three bombs I had into the lake on my way to Pullman,
</p>
<p>because I learned they were dangerous and I did not want them any
</p>
<p>longer. I saw at Neff's Hall that night, May 4, a crowd of men together
</p>
<p>for a while, and then they began to part. They went away in groups of
</p>
<p>five or six. They all went on Clybourn Avenue to Larrabee Street. As

</p>
<p>we got to Larrabee Street, they all separated and spread on Larrabee
</p>
<p>Street. I went up to North Avenue and Larrabee Street to the police
</p>
<p>station with a strange man. I remained there for some time. I saw Seli-
</p>
<p>ger and Lingg near the station, going north on Larrabee Street. When I
</p>
<p>was at Seliger's house one of the five men present said to me to throw
</p>
<p>bombs into the police station to kill the police, and if any patrol wagons
</p>
<p>escaped and came out to throw bombs into the wagons among the officers
</p>
<p>and shoot the horses. This was for the purpose of preventing them from
</p>
<p>giving assistance to each other. I smoked a cigar that night so that I
</p>
<p>would have a fire ready to light the bombs with and throw them if neces-
</p>
<p>sary. I only smoke cigars on Sundays, and, as I am not accustomed to
</p>
<p>smoke much, the cigar made me sick. I sat for some time on an iron rail-
</p>
<p>ing on Larrabee Street, opposite the police station, on the southeast corner.
</p>
<p>I sat there about fifteen minutes. The wagon failed to come out, and, as I
</p>
<p>felt sick and could not do much anyway, I went home. Lingg and Seliger
</p>
<p>walked ahead of me. I saw them last when they crossed North Avenue,
</p>
<p>going north on Larrabee Street. The next evening I went to No. 58 Cly-
</p>
<p>bourn Avenue. I met Hubner, and he said that on the night of the shoot-
</p>
<p>316 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>ing he was at Lincoln Park. I recognize this picture now shown me as
</p>
<p>being that of Seliger. I saw him making dynamite bombs at 442 Sedgwick
</p>
<p>Street on the afternoon of May 4 in company with Lingg. The man I
</p>
<p>have seen locked up in this station I saw working and making dynamite
</p>
<p>bombs in company with Seliger, and his name is Louis Lingg. When I
</p>
<p>was at Seliger's house, Hubner told me to go to Lincoln Park, and there I
</p>
<p>would get my instructions."
</p>
<p>THE next Anarchist brought into the station was AUGUST GRAGGE. He
</p>
<p>was a German, twenty-eight years of age, straight and stoutly built, a brick-
</p>
<p>layer by trade, and lived at No. 880 North Halsted Street. He was arrested
</p>
<p>on the 24th of May. I gave him an evening's audience shortly after. It
</p>
<p>was apparent from his demeanor that he was a young man easily led astray
</p>
<p>by men of force and decision of character ; therefore it was no wonder that
</p>
<p>he had become an extreme Anarchist, especially since he had been thrown a
</p>
<p>great deal into the company of some of the rankest leaders in the order and
</p>
<p>had attended meetings where gore and plunder formed the chief topics of
</p>
<p>discussion. When the authorities took him in hand, he soon modified his
</p>
<p>opinions. He stated that, like a great many others, he had been misled to
</p>
<p>believe that Anarchist doctrines were right and that no law existed to
</p>
<p>interfere with them ; but after the law had been read to him, he acknowl-
</p>
<p>edged that he had pursued a wrong course. He had been a man of sober
</p>
<p>habits, and on being questioned he told a very straightforward story. After
</p>
<p>giving such information as he possessed he was released by the State's
</p>
<p>Attorney, and he promised to mend his ways.
</p>
<p>The statement he made to me was as follows :
</p>
<p>"A man by the name of Lange and another, August Asher, coaxed me
</p>
<p>into the armed group. Charles Bock was our secretary four or five weeks
</p>
<p>ago. I heard Rau and Lingg speak in Neff's Hall. Lingg spoke about
</p>
<p>dynamite and called on us to arm ourselves. They also wanted us to buy
</p>
<p>revolvers. I bought one a big one for $4. I paid $2 down. Asher
</p>
<p>and I went to the meeting at the Haymarket on the evening of May 4. I
</p>
<p>saw the circular that called that meeting. We had our big revolvers with
</p>
<p>us when we went there. When the shooting commenced we ran. I fell
</p>

<p>revolver. We had a meeting on Monday night, May 3, at Neff's Hall.
</p>
<p>Abraham Hermann had three or four revolvers for sale. Asher always kept
</p>
<p>the Arbeiter-Zeitung, and at times I would read it. The first man I heard
</p>
<p>speak at the Haymarket was August Spies, then Parsons, and Fielden next
</p>
<p>I saw Schnaubelt standing on the wagon with Spies. On account of its
</p>
<p>looking like rain it was decided to go to Zepf's Hall. Parsons, however,
</p>
<p>told the people to remain, as he only had a few more words. The police
</p>
<p>finally came. Some of the people started to go away, but some one in a
</p>
<p>loud voice urged them to remain. Then firing commenced. I heard the
</p>
<p>explosion of the bomb. As I stated, I fell down. As soon as I could get
</p>
<p>up I started to run for the North Side. I went to Neff's Hall. I found
</p>
<p>there several that I knew. I told them I had lost my revolver and then
</p>
<p>explained what had happened at the Haymarket. I carried my revolver in
</p>
<p>INCENDIARISM AND MURDER. 317
</p>
<p>my hip pocket, and it dropped out as I fell. The revolver was loaded. I
</p>
<p>know Lingg. I have heard him speak at least four or five times. He
</p>
<p>would always call on the people to arm themselves. He also said that they
</p>
<p>were too slow in getting arms and that the time would come for their use
</p>
<p>and they ought to be ready."
</p>
<p>GUSTAV BREITENFELD was next arrested. He was a German, aged thirty,
</p>
<p>a brush- maker by trade, and lived in the lower flat of a two- story house at
</p>
<p>No. 1 8 Samuel Street. On May 4 he was commander of the second com-
</p>
<p>pany of the Lehr und Wehr Verein, and he had previously taken an active
</p>
<p>part at all Anarchist meetings. He was regarded as a star Anarchist on the
</p>
<p>Northwest Side, and frequently visited the house of George Engel.
</p>
<p>Gustav was an Anarchist jumping-jack. All that the leaders had to do
</p>
<p>was to pull the strings, and he responded. He served on all committees, and
</p>
<p>whenever in doubt as to any course of procedure he went to Engel for advice.
</p>
<p>He lacked judgment and brains, and he sought to make up the deficiency
</p>
<p>by consulting the leaders. But withal he was a dangerous man. He was
</p>
<p>quick-tempered, but a coward when he thought he was not likely to get the
</p>
<p>best of the situation.
</p>
<p>On the night of May 4 he had his company ready near the city limits to
</p>
<p>murder people and set fire to buildings, only awaiting orders to set about
</p>
<p>the work of general destruction. They expected to see the police flee from
</p>
<p>the Haymarket, but as the reds did the running on that occasion, the com-
</p>
<p>bination failed. Their " signal " committees were scattered and their com-
</p>
<p>rades became demoralized at the unexpected charge of the police.
</p>
<p>Breitenfeld and his company heard the shooting at their place of rendez-
</p>
<p>vous, and, failing to receive the signal to begin the attack, he went to
</p>
<p>Engel's house to ascertain what was wrong. Learning of the drubbing his
</p>
<p>comrades had received at the Haymarket, he was not anxious to take simi-
</p>
<p>lar "medicine," and he skulked away like a whipped cur. A house had
</p>
<p>been chosen near the limits for the incendiary torches of his company, and it
</p>
<p>would have been in flames on their first advance if they had received the
</p>
<p>signal. But the company were dismissed, and all hurried home to escape
</p>
<p>danger. For two weeks they were in mortal dread of the police.
</p>
<p>If, however, these misguided men had been started that night, with all

</p>
<p>things in their favor, there is no telling what fearful havoc they would have
</p>
<p>created. The company was composed of men desperate enough, under
</p>
<p>proper encouragement, to have murdered people asleep or awake They
</p>
<p>would have held high carnival if the Haymarket meeting had come out
</p>
<p>according to expectations, and the able-bodied and the helpless would have
</p>
<p>suffered alike at their hands. Their plan was to shoot or stab everybody
</p>
<p>who opposed their onward march into the city, and, crazed with success,
</p>
<p>they would have hesitated at nothing.
</p>
<p>Breitenfeld knew all the villainous arrangements, and he was therefore a
</p>
<p>3i8 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>man the police sought after. He was found on the 25th of May, at about
</p>
<p>seven o'clock, by Officers Stift and Schuettler, and brought to the Chicago
</p>
<p>Avenue Station. When I had the honor of meeting him, he at once assumed
</p>
<p>military airs, but he soon found himself reduced to the ranks. As he was
</p>
<p>one of the few who understood English, the law on conspiracies was read
</p>
<p>to him. Then he was informed that he had been indicted, and was told
</p>
<p>what could be proved against him. He became terribly excited, could
</p>
<p>hardly speak, but finally managed to say :
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen, you have got the wrong man. You want to get my brother.
</p>
<p>I am not that Breitenfeld. I am a good, peaceable man."
</p>
<p>He was informed that lies were at a discount in the station just then,
</p>
<p>and that if he desired to speak and tell the truth an opportunity would be
</p>
<p>given him. If not, we would tolerate no nonsense. He refrained from
</p>
<p>speaking, and was sent below.
</p>
<p>The next day he sent word that he wanted to see me. He was brought
</p>
<p>up, and on being seated before Assistant State's Attorney Furthmann and
</p>
<p>all the officers, he said :
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen, I beg your pardon. I told you a lie. I am the man you
</p>
<p>want. I have a wife and family, and I love them. I beg of you now, if you
</p>
<p>let me speak, I will tell the truth and everything I know."
</p>
<p>" Tell all you know," said I, " and remember that I will know when you
</p>
<p>tell a falsehood."
</p>
<p>"I know you have everything by this time. If I tell you all and become
</p>
<p>a witness against these other fellows, will you let me go ? "
</p>
<p>" If you tell all and the truth. I will see the State's Attorney for you and
</p>
<p>ask him to take you as a witness."
</p>
<p>Breitenfeld thereupon made a statement, and a few days later he was
</p>
<p>released. When subsequently called on to testify, he refused to do so. He
</p>
<p>had told others that the State could not convict anybody, and he would not
</p>
<p>help the prosecution. He was, therefore, let alone. He is still under
</p>
<p>indictment. With the lesson he had received it was thought he would reform.
</p>
<p>In this we were mistaken. He has since attended a number of meetings,
</p>
<p>and at the funeral of Mrs. Neebe turned out with his company. He is the
</p>
<p>same unrepentant Anarchist that he was before his trouble, but he is being

</p>
<p>carefully watched wherever he goes.
</p>
<p>This is what he swore to at the station in the presence of Mr. Furth-
</p>
<p>mann, myself and the officers :
</p>
<p>"My name is Gustav Breitenfeld. I am thirty years ofd. I am mar-
</p>
<p>ried and I reside at No. 18 Samuel Street. I am a brush-maker. I am
</p>
<p>captain of the second company of the Lehr und Wehr Verein. We have
</p>
<p>twenty men in our company. I know Fischer and Schrade. Schrade is
</p>
<p>drill-sergeant of my company. On Sunday, May 2, I was at Pullman. I
</p>
<p>heard of the riot plan on Monday afternoon, May 3. I know George
</p>
<p>Engel, Deitz and Fischer. They are the principal leaders in the North-
</p>
<p>BREITENFEL&S RE VELA TIONS. 3 1 9
</p>
<p>west Side group and of the armed men. Heier is the name of the man
</p>
<p>who keeps Thalia Hall on Milwaukee Avenue. I know Kraemer ; he lives
</p>
<p>in the rear of Engel's house. I think I saw Kraemer at the meeting held
</p>
<p>on the evening of May 3, at 54 West Lake Street. I know Schmidt, the
</p>
<p>carrier of the Arbeiter-Zeitung. At that meeting I saw Krueger, Schrade,
</p>
<p>Gruenwald, Clermont, Kraemer, Deitz, Engel, Fischer, Schnaubelt and
</p>
<p>Waller. Waller was the chairman of the meeting. The first thing I heard
</p>
<p>they were denouncing the police force for killing the workingmen at
</p>
<p>McCormick's factory. I saw the revenge circular, which called the people
</p>
<p>to arms. I heard Engel say that when the word ' Ruhe ' should appear in
</p>
<p>the Arbeiter-Zeitung, every one should go to his meeting-place selected by
</p>
<p>them and be ready for action. I heard some one say that as soon as they
</p>
<p>saw the heavens illuminated with red fires, then was the time to commence
</p>
<p>the revolution. Engel and Fischer volunteered to carry the news form the
</p>
<p>Haymarket to the armed men stationed at Wicker Park. Engel volun-
</p>
<p>teered to act as a spy. I know Engel to have sold arms. At the meeting
</p>
<p>of May 3, I heard some one asking for dynamite bombs. I heard Engel
</p>
<p>respond that the dynamite bombs were ready and in good hands. Fischer
</p>
<p>agreed to have the circulars, calling the Haymarket meeting, printed. It
</p>
<p>was said lhat there would be from 20,000 to 30,000 people at that meeting,
</p>
<p>and that the police would interfere. Then would be a good time to attack
</p>
<p>them and get revenge on them for the killing of six of their comrades. The
</p>
<p>word ' Ruhe ' would signify that they should get ready and be on the look-
</p>
<p>out. Engel said that they should look for it in the Arbeiter-Zeitung on
</p>
<p>May 4, and they were all to go to their respective places, as agreed upon,
</p>
<p>with their arms or guns. The Haymarket meeting was decided upon as a
</p>
<p>trap to catch the police. Engel, Kraemer and Krueger went to the meeting
</p>
<p>to see if there was a big crowd there, and when they got back home Engel
</p>
<p>said there were only 250 men present. I went to see Engel on the morn-
</p>
<p>ing of May 4 at his house. He told me he had been at the meeting and
</p>
<p>there were present the number I have given. I attended the meeting of
</p>
<p>the Northwest Side group that decided to call the meeting for the evening
</p>
<p>of May 3, at 54 West Lake Street. I heard, at the last-named place, sev-
</p>
<p>eral say that the dynamite bombs were in good hands. I met Waller at

<p>Thalia Hall on May 4, about' eleven o'clock in the evening, and he
</p>
<p>remarked that they had had a very hot time of it at the Haymarket. I saw
</p>
<p>Fischer on Wednesday, May 5, at Thalia Hall, and he then told me that
</p>
<p>Spies had been arrested about four o'clock that morning. Spies is the only
</p>
<p>one I know of the Spies family. I have known him five years."
</p>
<p>WILLIAM HAGEMAN was the next to inspect our plain and unpretentious
</p>
<p>office. He came in on his dignity and carried an air about him that plainly
</p>
<p>exhibited his complete contempt for the police He was a German, about
</p>
<p>thirty years old, round-shouldered, a stair-builder by occupation, was mar-
</p>
<p>ried and had one child. He lived at the time of his arrest on the lower
</p>
<p>floor of a house at No. 49 Reese Street, and he could always be found when-
</p>
<p>ever Anarchist plots were to be executed. His brother was, like himself,
</p>
<p>a rampant Anarchist, but with cunning enough to escape arrest. William
</p>
<p>was found by Officers Schuettler and Hoffman, about seven o'clock on the
</p>
<p>320 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>morning of May 26. He did not long remain in ignorance of the cause of
</p>
<p>his arrest, and then he wanted me to understand :
</p>
<p>" My brother is no Anarchist. If any one does any squealing on him,
</p>
<p>don't pay any attention to it, because it all means me. I am the fellow.
</p>
<p>The people often get us mixed."
</p>
<p>"You are the worst Anarchist of the two," I remarked.
</p>
<p>Hageman wanted to know how I had come to that conclusion.
</p>
<p>" We know all about you," said I.
</p>
<p>" If you know it, be sure and don't forget it," was the reply. " I am
</p>
<p>sure you won't learn anything from me."
</p>
<p>"All right. But just as sure as you are sitting there, I will find out all
</p>
<p>your performances, and every one you associated with during the last two
</p>
<p>years, before you leave this station. And you will tell it to me yourself."
</p>
<p>" Never ; I will die first. I will kill myself first. I will stand any tor-
</p>
<p>ture you may inflict on me, but I will never tell on my comrades or any one
</p>
<p>that worked for our cause."
</p>
<p>" You probably don't remember the job you pledged yourself to under-
</p>
<p>take on the night of May 4. It was not a very small one either, but, of
</p>
<p>course, your nerves not being very strong that evening, you came here to a
</p>
<p>neighboring saloon several times to brace up, and your friends, lying in the
</p>
<p>rear of this station, felt very much the same way as you did. So you
</p>
<p>spelled one another and strengthened your nerves. Say, William, who said
</p>
<p>that the bombs were not good ? You remember the third window in the
</p>
<p>station on the east side of the building and the little quarrel about the
</p>
<p>bombs whether a round lead bomb should be thrown or a long gas-pipe
</p>
<p>bomb. Do you remember the two policemen that crossed the alley and
</p>
<p>stood still for a moment in the middle of that alley when you fellows thought
</p>
<p>you were discovered how you all got into the dark side of the alley and ran?
</p>
<p>Now, remember, when you get ready to talk, I will tell my side of the story,
</p>
<p>and should you get stuck, you see I can help you out a great deal. You
</p>
<p>might recall what little you know of the Haymarket, how you were surprised
</p>
<p>that only one bomb was thrown and how the fellows detailed for that duty
</p>
<p>did not attend to their business. Here, officers, show this gentleman the
</p>
<p>suite of rooms which he is to occupy for the next four weeks. If you desire

</p>
<p>anything extra that is not on our bill of fare, just touch the button, and you
</p>
<p>will be waited on promptly. Any inattention on the part of the waiters
</p>
<p>must be reported to this office. If you should conclude to make a long stay
</p>
<p>with us, you had better provide yourself with a good supply of tobacco.
</p>
<p>You understand that when a man is at sea he finds that there are a good
</p>
<p>many things he needs that would come in handy."
</p>
<p>He did not like his apartments singular to relate. There was no
</p>
<p>fire escape, the linen on the bed was not changed every day, and the noise
</p>
<p>of his neighbors kept him awake of nights. He had struck the wrong
</p>
<p>VERY UNPLEASANT BUSINESS. 321
</p>
<p>hotel, but his apartments had been engaged for him and paid for by the tax-
</p>
<p>payers, and he could not gracefully withdraw.
</p>
<p>Hageman first got tired, then angry, and finally desperate. He realised
</p>
<p>that he was in trouble and made up his mind to take me into his confidence.
</p>
<p>He reached this conclusion on the afternoon of May 27, and sent the janitor
</p>
<p>to the office with a message that he desired to see me. He was informed
</p>
<p>in return that he could not see me unless he meant to talk business. Hage-
</p>
<p>man responded that he was ready to talk on any subject upon which he
</p>
<p>might be questioned, and he was accordingly brought into the office, into
</p>
<p>the presence of Mr. Furthmann, myself and the detectives.
</p>
<p>"Well," said I, "I understand that you want to see me."
</p>
<p>"Yes, I do," was the response, "but not in the presence of all these
</p>
<p>fellows."
</p>
<p>"Why not?"
</p>
<p>" Because my business is with you alone."
</p>
<p>"Well, you see, William, I am only one, and as what you tell here,
</p>
<p>which must be the truth, will have to be given by you in the Criminal Court,
</p>
<p>and as I may probably get killed before that time, there would be no one to
</p>
<p>testify to your statement if given to me alone."
</p>
<p>" Oh, that is the way you want to catch me ! "
</p>
<p>"There is no catch about it. If you don't want to make a statement in
</p>
<p>the presence of all these men, I don't want to hear anything from you."
</p>
<p>"Will you answer me one question ?" asked Hageman, getting a little
</p>
<p>apprehensive that he might lose his only chance. " It is, has any one out of
</p>
<p>the many people locked up here squealed ? "
</p>
<p>" Well," I answered, "most of them have already done so, and the others
</p>
<p>are fairly breaking their necks to follow suit."
</p>
<p>" This is a very unpleasant thing to do."
</p>
<p>"Yes, that is true."
</p>
<p>" Can I get out by telling you all I know, and can you keep me from tes-
</p>
<p>tifying in court? You know this will kill a man forever."
</p>
<p>" Yes, but a great many policemen were killed, and they simply obeyed
</p>
<p>orders. If you think you are better than a policeman, you had better go
</p>
<p>down stairs again and await your trial in the Criminal Court."

<p>" Now, see here, Captain, I would never tell on anybody, but I have got
</p>
<p>a wife and little baby at home. It almost sets me crazy thinking of them,
</p>
<p>and for their sake I will tell all."
</p>
<p>Hageman did as he promised, but in the interview that ensued it became
</p>
<p>apparent that he was a double-faced man, and that, when it came to his
</p>
<p>family, he did not care a fig whether he landed the other fellows on the gal-
</p>
<p>lows or in the penitentiary. He had been a brave, boasting Anarchist.
</p>
<p>He had been accustomed to talk with his associates over foaming "schoon-
</p>
<p>ers " of beer, and the more beer there was the greater his talk about killing
</p>
<p>322 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>people and overthrowing capital. He was a great reader of Anarchistic
</p>
<p>papers and literature, and the more fiery and unbridled the sentiment, the
</p>
<p>better he was pleased. He took a hand in every movement, attended all
</p>
<p>the meetings and picnics of the reds, and made himself quite a useful mem-
</p>
<p>ber of the order. He continually boasted of the bombs that he had hid
</p>
<p>away for use, and promised to let capitalists hear from him. The bombs
</p>
<p>he had were found to be of the round lead and gas-pipe patterns, and some
</p>
<p>of them he had received from Fischer a long time before May 4. He had
</p>
<p>been posted as to the manufacture of bombs by Lingg, and was a warm
</p>
<p>friend of Engel, whose talk about bombs suited him exactly. Hageman
</p>
<p>could not listen patiently to any discussion from which dynamite was left
</p>
<p>out, and in any peaceful gathering he was sure to become a disturber. If
</p>
<p>there was no dispute, he would start one himself, and, if necessary, back up
</p>
<p>his argument with blows. Whenever a dance or benefit was held to replen-
</p>
<p>ish the treasury for the purchase of dynamite, he was promptly on hand and
</p>
<p>exerted himself to the utmost to swell the receipts. Being such an active
</p>
<p>member, it was natural that he knew a great deal about his order, and he
</p>
<p>helped the State very materially with the points he furnished.
</p>
<p>He was kept in custody until after the trial, and with the experience he
</p>
<p>had in prison one would think that he would cut loose altogether from
</p>
<p>Anarchy. Not so, however. While nearly all the others repented of their
</p>
<p>error, Hageman had no sooner regained his liberty than he became as rad-
</p>
<p>ical as ever. He even threatened several times to kill State's Attorney
</p>
<p>Grinnell, Judge Gary, myself and others. After the trial, I had a detective
</p>
<p>at every meeting of the Anarchists, and the reports brought me were that
</p>
<p>Hageman and Bernhard Schrade were the most violent and determined men
</p>
<p>in the union.
</p>
<p>Hageman would boastingly say, " I never squealed to that man Schaack.
</p>
<p>If they had all done as I did, they would know very little about the Anar-
</p>
<p>chists."
</p>
<p>One night, at 54 West Lake Street, this arrant knave was approached by
</p>
<p>one of his supposed warm friends, who happened, however, to be in my
</p>
<p>confidence, and who said to him :
</p>
<p>" You don't like Schaack, and I don't like him. He is now here at the

<p>Desplaines Street Station. We can go into the alley and shoot him in his
</p>
<p>office. I have a revolver here with me now, and I will go into Florus' and
</p>
<p>get one more. Then we will go and ' do him.' We will both go and fire
</p>
<p>together and run. But mind, let there be no arrest in our case ; let us die
</p>
<p>before capture."
</p>
<p>" Do you mean this ? " asked Hageman.
</p>
<p>" Here is my hand. Here is my revolver, and if you play coward on me
</p>
<p>I will kill you standing up. Now, come on."
</p>
<p>A COWARD UNMASKED. 323
</p>
<p>Did Hageman respond ? Not at all. He crawled on his belly with
</p>
<p>excuses.
</p>
<p>" That man Schaack," he said, " knows me so well that it is not safe to go
</p>
<p>around there."
</p>
<p>"Well," replied his companion, "we can go through a vacant lot."
</p>
<p>" It is too dangerous, my boy," said Hageman. "I could do all this
</p>
<p>well enough if I never would be found out."
</p>
<p>"Well," said the companion, "you are a crazy coward, and don't you
</p>
<p>' shoot your mouth' hereafter where I am."
</p>
<p>Hageman subsided for the time, but he is again as rampant as ever.
</p>
<p>Here is Hageman's statement, which he made "for the sake of his own
</p>
<p>family," but which helped to drive the nails into the coffins of other families :
</p>
<p>"I was at the meeting held at Neff's Hall, No. 121 West Lake Street.
</p>
<p>I saw Lmgg there and heard him address the people, calling them to arms.
</p>
<p>I also saw Thielen, the two Lehmans and Peter Huber. Niendorf was
</p>
<p>chairman of the meeting, which had been called to consider the eight-hour
</p>
<p>movement. Some one at that meeting called out that there was a meeting
</p>
<p>at No. 54 West Lake Street and said, ' Let us go there.' Then a number of
</p>
<p>us went, including Hubner, Thielen and myself. I stood at the right hand
</p>
<p>side as one entered the basement after I got there. The meeting lasted
</p>
<p>from half to three quarters of an hour. I saw there Fischer, Engel and
</p>
<p>Waller. Waller was chairman. I heard Engel speak. He told us to
</p>
<p>watch for the red fires, and when we saw them in the heavens, then was the
</p>
<p>time to commence the revolution. The fires were to be the signals for the
</p>
<p>outside posts that the riot at the Haymarket had commenced. It was also
</p>
<p>to be regarded as a signal that the police had made an attack on the meet-
</p>
<p>ing at the Haymarket, and then we should commence the work of destruc-
</p>
<p>tion. Every one should pick out houses beforehand, so that they could be
</p>
<p>set on fire when the signal was given. Engel also said at this meeting that
</p>
<p>the stuff, meaning dynamite, was cheap, and that any member could buy
</p>
<p>some. He referred to the police and said that if they saw a patrol wagon
</p>
<p>on the street filled with officers they should destroy the wagon and the
</p>
<p>police by throwing bombs into the wagon. He (Engel) urged every man to
</p>
<p>do as much harm as possible, meaning destruction of property and killing

<p>people. I heard this plan repeated afterwards by a black-whiskered man
</p>
<p>named Waller. Waller said that this plan for the revolution had been
</p>
<p>adopted by the West Side armed group. Hermann and I were at the Hay-
</p>
<p>market meeting, but when the shooting began we ran away."
</p>
<p>ALBERT JEBOLINSKI was another welcome guest on the 26th of May. He
</p>
<p>had been frequently invited to partake of the hospitalities of the station, but
</p>
<p>he appeared to be contented with putting up with dingy quarters in out-of-
</p>
<p>the-way places rather than run the risk of meeting a policeman. But on the
</p>
<p>day in question he received such a pressing invitation from Schuettler and
</p>
<p>Hoffman that he finally yielded. He was a German Pole, thirty-five years
</p>
<p>of age, of slim build, and, with a dark mustache and large goatee, he looked
</p>
<p>like a Frenchman. He lived at the time in a two-story brick building, first
</p>
<p>flat, at No. 1 1 Penn Street. The officers knew that he was a very sus-
</p>
<p>324 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>picious man and that he would run blocks to get out of the way of a police-
</p>
<p>man, so great was his hatred of the force. They therefore approached his
</p>
<p>house cautiously, lest he might mistake them for blue-coats. They called
</p>
<p>rather early, four o'clock in the morning, and Schuettler, giving a regular
</p>
<p>milkman's rap on the door, brought Mrs. Jebolinski to the front.
</p>
<p>" Who is there," she shouted before venturing to open the door, '' and
</p>
<p>what is wanted ? "
</p>
<p>"I am here the milkman," responded Schuettler. "I want to see
</p>
<p>you, madam."*
</p>
<p>With this assurance Mrs. Jebolinski opened the door, but the moment
</p>
<p>she discovered that it was not the milkman, she slammed the door to not
</p>
<p>quick enough, however, to close it, for the officer, seeing his chance, had
</p>
<p>thrust his foot between the door and the frame. Hoffman came at once to
</p>
<p>the rescue and informed the woman that I had sent him after her husband.
</p>
<p>" We don't know anything about Capt. Schaack," she responded, and
</p>
<p>again tried to close the door.
</p>
<p>"Well, madam, I am sure the Captain knows something about you
</p>
<p>folks."
</p>
<p>And with this bit of information the officers pushed the door open.
</p>
<p>This was too much for Mrs. Jebolinski. She shouted to her husband :
</p>
<p>" O Albert, the spitzel, the police ! "
</p>
<p>"Don't open the door for anybody," came in stentorian tones from
</p>
<p>Albert in an adjoining room. " Keep them out ! "
</p>
<p>The officers had meantime effected an entrance, and, following up the
</p>
<p>voice, found Albert in bed.
</p>
<p>" Good morning, Albert," said Schuettler, in pleasant, cheerful tones.
</p>
<p>" Who told you to come here?" gruffly demanded Albert.
</p>
<p>" Capt. Schaack desires to see you on pressing business."
</p>
<p>" Oh, yes ; he must be in love with me, since he sent you so early to see
</p>
<p>me. Has no one killed that d d bloodhound yet ? "
</p>
<p>" No, Albert, you will have a chance to see him soon, and then you can
</p>
<p>kill him."
</p>
<p>"You go and tell Schaack that you have seen me, and that will be suffi-
</p>
<p>cient. I will die first before I go. You cannot take me out of here. I

</p>
<p>want my breakfast, and I will take a sleep before my wife calls me."
</p>
<p>So saying, Albert jumped back into bed. Officer Schuettler remon-
</p>
<p>strated, and was finally obliged to pull him out. Albert then refused to
</p>
<p>dress. Talking to him had no more effect than talking to a stone wall.
</p>
<p>Hoffman then opened the door, and Schuettler grabbed Albert under his
</p>
<p>arm and walked out with him despite his kicks and resistance. They got
</p>
<p>him out into the bracing atmosphere of the morning, and, although Albert
</p>
<p>was not dressed for company, they started off with him.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Jebolinski rushed out after them, and, wildly gesticulating, shouted :-
</p>
<p>A DISCONTENTED LODGER.
</p>
<p>325
</p>
<p>" Bring him back, bring him back, and I will dress him."
</p>
<p>The officers retraced their steps, but not back into the house. They
</p>
<p>took Albert to the wood-shed, and there he was dressed.
</p>
<p>At the station he was invited down stairs and told that there were so
</p>
<p>many who wanted to see me that he would probably have a rest for a week.
</p>
<p>He was locked up, and during the first day he would neither eat nor drink.
</p>
<p>He was not coaxed, however, and the next morning he called the janitor,
</p>
<p>saying :
</p>
<p>' ' I am sick ; will you give me
</p>
<p>a cup of coffee?"
</p>
<p>The janitor replied that he
</p>
<p>would have to wait till nine o'clock,
</p>
<p>when the prisoners came down from
</p>
<p>court.
</p>
<p>"Well," said Albert, indig-
</p>
<p>nantly, "if I don't get my coffee
</p>
<p>now. you can
</p>
<p>keep your
</p>
<p>breakfast."
</p>
<p>When nine
</p>
<p>o'clock came
</p>
<p>around the jan-
</p>
<p>itor made the
</p>
<p>round, inviting
</p>
<p>the sleepers to
</p>
<p>wake and get
</p>
<p>their breakfast.
</p>
<p>" You can go
</p>
<p>to the d 1 ; you can't make me eat," said Jebolinski, and he settled him-
</p>
<p>self for a nap.
</p>
<p>But when the dinner hour came Albert made up for lost time and missed
</p>
<p>meals. At four o'clock he sent the janitor to the office to tell me that he
</p>
<p>wanted to see me. He was brought up.

</p>
<p>" Well, Albert," said I, "how much do you weigh now?"
</p>
<p>"You had better let me go home. I will never tell you anything.
</p>
<p>It is no use keeping me here."
</p>
<p>" I don't want you to tell me anything. I have secured more evidence
</p>
<p>in the last few days than I want, and now they are all arrested. I am going
</p>
<p>to prosecute you in court for conspiracy and murder ; so you need not
</p>
<p>trouble yourself with being stubborn. I don't want to see you again, not
</p>
<p>till I see you in court. Officer, take him back to the lock-up."
</p>
<p>" So you can do without me? "
</p>
<p>" Yes, I am sure I can."
</p>
<p>A HASTY TOILET.
</p>
<p>326 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>Albert was escorted down stairs, but inside of two hours he asked for
</p>
<p>Officer Schuettler.
</p>
<p>" I can see now," he said to Schuettler, " that that man Schaack wants
</p>
<p>to hang me."
</p>
<p>" I am sure he is done with you," replied the officer.
</p>
<p>" I beg of you to tell the Captain I want to see him, and say to him that
</p>
<p>I will tell him about the bombs and everything else."
</p>
<p>Officer Schuettler reported the Anarchist's wishes, and Jebolinski was
</p>
<p>once more brought up. He then confessed that he had four loaded bombs
</p>
<p>planted, which he would show if taken out.
</p>
<p>He was accordingly taken in charge by Officers Schuettler and Hoff-
</p>
<p>man, whom he led to a place north of Division Street near a planing-mill
</p>
<p>and linseed-oil factory. At that place there was a side-track, and, at a
</p>
<p>point where the locomotives were stopped to be dumped of their cinders,
</p>
<p>he unearthed his bombs. These bombs were covered with about four inches
</p>
<p>of cinders, midway between the rails, and when they were taken out they
</p>
<p>were found fully loaded, with fuse and caps. That there had been no
</p>
<p>explosion is almost a miracle. Had a locomotive been stationed over the
</p>
<p>spot for an hour, as frequently happened, the cinders would have been set
</p>
<p>on fire again. In an instant locomotive and all would have been blown to
</p>
<p>atoms, and no one would have known the precise cause. It was lucky for
</p>
<p>some engineer and fireman, and, in fact, for the locality, that no engine
</p>
<p>stood over the spot after those bombs had been planted.
</p>
<p>On returning to the station, Jebolinski furnished the State with much
</p>
<p>valuable information. He was indicted and held as a witness. But he was
</p>
<p>never called, and after the trial he was given his liberty. He has been
</p>
<p>watched since and found to be attending strictly to his own business. In
</p>
<p>his statement he sets forth his attendance at the meeting at 121 West Lake
</p>
<p>Street, where were present Lingg, Rau and others, and his presence at the
</p>
<p>Haymarket meeting, from which he ran the moment the firing commenced.
</p>
<p>He also described the bombs, three round lead and one long iron one,
</p>
<p>which he had obtained from Hageman, the one-eyed carpenter.
</p>
<p>PETER HUBER was another distinguished caller, by special invitation.
</p>
<p>He was escorted to the office by Officers Whalen and Stift and took things

<p>very coolly. He was a lank, lean, consumptive-looking fellow, only twenty-
</p>
<p>nine years of age, and earned his living as a cabinet-maker. He was a
</p>
<p>German, married, and had two children, living in a two-story frame house
</p>
<p>at No. 96 Hudson Avenue. His manner was very quiet, and no one would
</p>
<p>have taken him for an Anarchist. But Peter, nevertheless, was heart and
</p>
<p>soul in the movement, and had regularly attended all the meetings. He
</p>
<p>had never made a speech he was too diffident for that; he had never
</p>
<p>advised any one on Anarchy, but he had come to be trusted, and he knew
</p>
<p>all the leaders and all about dynamite bombs. He was so undemonstra-
</p>
<p>HUBERTS INFORMATION.
</p>
<p>327
</p>
<p>tive and non-communicative that at first I took him to be a paid detective in
</p>
<p>the ranks of the Socialists. When he was asked a question, he would take
</p>
<p>his own time to answer, and, once interrupted in his talk, he would stop
</p>
<p>and say no more.
</p>
<p>On the second day after his arrest May 25 Huber offered to answer
</p>
<p>questions, and he did this without any inducement. He thereupon furn-
</p>
<p>ished the State with several good points, and freely told everything. He
</p>
<p>was indicted, but released by order of the State's Attorney. He was ready
</p>
<p>to testify at the trial, but was not wanted. He has since kept away from
</p>
<p>Anarchist meetings, and is now a
</p>
<p>useful man to his family.
</p>
<p>Huber's statement ran as fol-
</p>
<p>lows :
</p>
<p>" I belonged to the North Side
</p>
<p>armed group. I know Seliger, Hub-
</p>
<p>ner, Lehman the carpenter, the two

<p>edition of that paper is called Die

</p>
<p>saloon at No. 54 West Lake Street, I heard some one
</p>
<p>say that a meeting would be held down stairs in the basement. So we
</p>
<p>went down stairs. When I entered I saw about thirty or forty present. I
</p>
<p>sat down on a bench, and we sat there for some time before the meeting
</p>
<p>opened. I heard some one say that it would be an indignation meeting on
</p>
<p>account of our workingmen having been killed at McCormick's factory by
</p>
<p>the police on that day. I saw at that meeting the circular calling for revenge
</p>
<p>and the people to arms, because of the killing of our brothers. I saw the
</p>
<p>same circular that same evening at the hall No. 71 West Lake Street. Waller
</p>
<p>was chairman of the meeting at No. 54 West Lake Street. I met there Hub-
</p>
<p>ner, Abraham Hermann, Fischer and Breitenfeld, the captain of the second
</p>
<p>company of the Lehr und Wehr Verein. I heard Engel make a speech, and
</p>
<p>during the whole time Breitenfeld was walking up and down the hall. I also
</p>
<p>saw Schnaubelt and Thielen there. I was at Neff's Hall, No. 58 Clybourn
</p>
<p>Avenue, early Tuesday evening, May 4th, and saw there Lingg, Seliger and
</p>
<p>Hubner. I heard Engel, at No. 54 West Lake Street, explain his plan
</p>
<p>328 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>and the work that should be done under it. A meeting, he said, would be
</p>
<p>held at the Haymarket, and when the police interfered the crowd should
</p>
<p>attack them, and the armed men should be ready for action. Some one
</p>
<p>suggested that they should hold their meeting at the Market Square on the
</p>
<p>South Side, between Randolph and Madison Streets. Some one else
</p>
<p>remarked : ' No, that is not a good place ; it is a mouse trap. ' If they held
</p>
<p>the meeting there and the police interfered, and the crowd resisted them,
</p>
<p>the police would drive them all into the river. Some said, 'That's so,' and
</p>
<p>then the meeting was fixed for the Haymarket, as Engel had suggested.
</p>
<p>We expected from 20,000 to 30,000 people present. We all had the idea
</p>
<p>that the police would interfere. Engel gave his plan about as follows : He
</p>
<p>said, ' First call the meeting for the Haymarket,' and then urged that the
</p>
<p>armed men be ready. He advised us to throw dynamite bombs into the
</p>
<p>stations, kill the police, throw dynamite bombs into the patrol wagons and
</p>
<p>shoot down the horses at the wagons. He repeated his plan for those who
</p>
<p>came in later to the meeting. The revenge circular was distributed both
</p>
<p>up stairs and down stairs at No. 54 West Lake Street. In the evening of
</p>
<p>May 3d, I saw Spies and Rau together in Zepf's saloon. As to the word
</p>
<p>'Ruhe,' I heard Engel say that when we saw that word appear in the
</p>
<p>paper, then we might know everything was right and ready. And we
</p>
<p>should watch for that signal. I heard Engel say that a man who could do
</p>
<p>no harm or create no disturbance should stay at home, as he was not wanted.
</p>
<p>When he had finished giving his plan, it was adopted. Schnaubelt said
</p>
<p>that outside cities, where they had comrades, should be notified at once as
</p>
<p>soon as the revolution was a success here. I saw Fischer at this meeting.
</p>
<p>He went to the Arbeiter-Zeitung to see if he could print the circular that
</p>
<p>night, calling the Haymarket meeting for the next evening. He came back
</p>
<p>and reported that the office was closed. He said he would attend to it in
</p>
<p>the morning. I saw Lingg, Seliger, Muntzenberg and Hubner in Neff's
</p>
<p>saloon, No. 58 Clybourn Avenue, about eight o'clock on the evening of
</p>
<p>May 4th."
</p>
<p>BERNHARD SCHRADE, a German, was a peculiar combination of eccen-
</p>
<p>tricities. He was arrested by Officers Whalen and Loewenstein on the
</p>
<p>evening of May 26, at nine o'clock, on Milwaukee Avenue, near Division

</p>
<p>Street. He was twenty-eight years of age, six feet tall, of straight and mus-
</p>
<p>cular build, nervous and quick-tempered, a carpenter by occupation, and he
</p>
<p>lived at No. 581 Milwaukee Avenue. When he was seated in the station it
</p>
<p>did not take us long to ascertain all he knew about Anarchy. In speaking
</p>
<p>of the Haymarket, he said that the right men had not been in their places,
</p>
<p>or things would have turned out quite differently. They had plenty of arms
</p>
<p>and bombs, he explained, but the leaders did not know their business.
</p>
<p>Early in the evening there was a large crowd, he said, but the great majority
</p>
<p>of them left in disgust because there was not a larger gathering and the
</p>
<p>speeches were not radical enough to suit their ideas. They expected some-
</p>
<p>thing fiery and impetuous. (This was about the time Mayor Harrison was
</p>
<p>at the meeting, and the speeches were accordingly very mild.) Those
</p>
<p>that left the meeting and did not go home, Schrade said, hung around the
</p>
<p>saloons in the neighborhood. If six hundred police, he further said, had
</p>
<p>B OISTER O US RE VOL UTION1STS.
</p>
<p>329
</p>
<p>attacked the crowd an hour earlier, few of them would have been left with
</p>
<p>their lives. He knew the arrangements, and, had the plan been carried out,
</p>
<p>the loss of life would have been appalling.
</p>
<p>Schrade was subsequently released by order of Assistant State's Attorney
</p>
<p>Furthmann, and promised that he would testify in court. He was several
</p>
<p>times sent after to give further information, and he always responded.
</p>
<p>About one month after Schrade's release, he and two others visited a
</p>
<p>saloon on North Avenue one night, and, after drinking a
</p>
<p>great deal of beer, they became exceedingly noisy and
</p>
<p>boisterous. The saloon-keeper attempted to quiet them,
</p>
<p>but was finally obliged to call an officer. Now, none of
</p>
<p>the bibulous individuals had any liking for a police-
</p>
<p>AN OBSTREPEROUS PRISONER.
</p>
<p>man. The moment they saw him enter they ordered him
</p>
<p>out and threatened that if he did not get out they would
</p>
<p>throw him out through the window. The officer was not
</p>
<p>at all alarmed, and, seeing that he was bent on keeping them quiet, the three
</p>
<p>disturbers pounced down upon him. The officer promptly brought his club
</p>
<p>into play, and soon his opponents measured their length upon the floor.
</p>
<p>The sawdust was sprinkled with blood, but, before the reds could make a
</p>
<p>second assault, a citizen had brought the patrol wagon to the rescue. They
</p>
<p>were taken in charge and thrown into the wagon in their drunken stupor,

</p>
<p>and carted to the Larrabee Street Station.
</p>
<p>330 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>On the way Schrade revived somewhat, and, not quite satisfied with the
</p>
<p>results of his former encounter, attempted to throw one of the officers over
</p>
<p>the side of the wagon. He was clinched by the throat, however, and kept
</p>
<p>quiet for the rest of the journey. The next morning the trio were fined in
</p>
<p>the Police Court and released on payment of the fines. Schrade became
</p>
<p>penitent and remained sober thereafter for some time. As he was out of
</p>
<p>work, I paid his board bill for two weeks, and kept him under surveillance
</p>
<p>to appear at the trial as a witness. When the trial began he was in good
</p>
<p>humor and told the State's Attorney that he would give the same testimony
</p>
<p>that he had given at the station May 26. He was accordingly produced as
</p>
<p>a witness. On the stand he failed to unfold all the information he had pre-
</p>
<p>viously given, but State's Attorney Grinnell knew all the points in his for-
</p>
<p>imer testimony, and before he got through with Schrade he made him a good
</p>
<p>witness for the State.
</p>
<p>After the trial the police lost sight of Schrade for a long time, and won-
</p>
<p>dered whether he had been quietly murdered by his former comrades or had
</p>
<p>left the city for his own good. But one day an officer reported to me that
</p>
<p>Schrade was still in the city. It was supposed, of course, that he would
</p>
<p>never again be found in the haunts of Socialists. It was discovered, how-
</p>
<p>ever, that he was a member in good standing of Carpenters' Union No. 241,
</p>
<p>-formerly No. i. This is the most rabid Anarchist organization in the city,
</p>
<p>.and, were it not for some comparatively conservative members, would have
</p>

</p>
<p>Schrade and Hageman, since their restoration to full membership, were

<p>found to be as incendiary as ever in their utterances, and seemed to vie
</p>
<p>with each other in their efforts to show that they were better Anarchists
</p>
<p>even than before the time they informed on their companions and helped to
</p>
<p>bring them to the gallows. In fact, they became so demonstrative that some
</p>
<p>of the members threatened them with expulsion. For this they sought
</p>
<p>revenge by working upon weak-minded persons to influence them against
</p>
<p>the leaders in the organization. As long as the conservatives remain at

<p>AUGUST AHLERS was known to have been a close friend of Lingg, and
</p>
<p>accordingly I eagerly sought his acquaintance. But Ahlers after the Hay-
</p>
<p>market conceived an aversion to fresh air and kept himself in gloomy,
</p>
<p>oinfrequented quarters. The officers knew that he had often visited Lingg's
</p>
<p>room, sometimes remaining three or four hours, and, as Lingg never toler-
</p>
<p>ated any one who could not be made useful, it was believed that Ahlers
</p>
<p>could furnish valuable information if found. Mrs. Seliger had stated that
</p>
<p>.a great many visited Lingg, but most of them sought to conceal their faces
</p>
<p>" / DON'T KNOW THE LEAST THING." 331
</p>
<p>or disguise themselves in some way, generally sneaking into the house as if
</p>
<p>they were going to steal something or kill somebody. This man Ahlers had
</p>
<p>been one of this kind. Lingg had every man who assisted him do certain
</p>
<p>special lines of work. Some would bring him lead, others gas-pipe, and
</p>
<p>others again charcoal, etc. Ahlers had helped in some way, and, with a
</p>
<p>pretty good description of him, the detectives were continually on the
</p>
<p>watch. Finally Officers Whalen and Loewenstein found him on the a6th
</p>
<p>of May, at No. 148 Chicago Avenue, and took him to the station. He had
</p>
<p>a sneaking demeanor, and when brought before me I asked him to give an
</p>
<p>account of himself between May 3d and May 6th. This he was unable to
</p>
<p>do, but after having been locked up for a while he gave some information
</p>
<p>about outside groups. As to Lingg he pretended to know very little, and
</p>
<p>as the officers could not identify him with any particular person, he was
</p>
<p>released on a promise of better behavior. He acknowledged having been
</p>
<p>a great admirer of the Anarchist leaders and a strong supporter of Anarchy,
</p>
<p>but now, he said, he would no longer affiliate with them. So far as the
</p>
<p>officers have observed, he has kept his promise and is attending strictly to
</p>
<p>his trade, that of a carpenter.
</p>
<p>We had these kind of fellows by the hundred in this city on May 4,
</p>
<p>1886, but fortunately God made most of them with big stomachs and no
</p>
<p>heart or courage.
</p>
<p>VICTOR CLERMONT, a German, was almost dumbfounded when he was
</p>
<p>informed that I wanted to see him. Clermont is a French-sounding name,
</p>
<p>and, when Officers Whalen and Loewenstein took him in charge on suspi-
</p>
<p>cion, they mistook him for a Frenchman, especially as he looked very much
</p>
<p>like one, having a dark mustache and goatee. Clermont was taken to the
</p>
<p>station, and there gave his age as twenty-seven, occupation a cabinet-maker
</p>
<p>and pool-billiard maker, and his residence No. 116 Cornelia Street. When
</p>
<p>questioned with reference to Anarchy he expressed surprise that he should
</p>
<p>be taken for an Anarchist, but when he was informed as to his having mys-
</p>
<p>teriously sneaked into dark basements which were lighted up with candles
</p>
<p>and whose doors were barricaded, he looked aghast.
</p>
<p>"There is something wrong," he said. "Somebody wants to involve
</p>
<p>me in the Haymarket trouble. I am sure I don't know the least thing

<p>about Anarchists."
</p>
<p>" Well," said I, " we will see if you can remember anything. Either you
</p>
<p>or your wife has some relatives living near the city. After the 4th of May
</p>
<p>you sent a lot of guns, rifles, ammunition and some bombs to them for safe-
</p>
<p>keeping. You took them away at night, and you have been so careful as to
</p>
<p>try and disguise yourself. Yet I cannot prosecute you on that. You have
</p>
<p>also been an active member on the Northwest Side in all Anarchist move-
</p>
<p>ments. You know all the things you have been engaged in, and so do we.
</p>
<p>I have your record right here."
</p>
<p>332 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>" Oh, yes," said Victor, "I hear that you fellows have things down very
</p>
<p>fine, because you have everything your own way. Well, if I do acknowledge
</p>
<p>all I have done, what are you going to do with me ? "
</p>
<p>" I will do with you the same as I have done with others. I will hear
</p>
<p>your statement and see if you can tell the truth. If you lie to me or about
</p>
<p>any one else, I will stop you, and that is all. You are indicted, and I will
</p>
<p>send you to jail. If you tell the truth I will send for the State's Attorney
</p>
<p>and ask him to let you go, but you must appear as a witness whenever we
</p>
<p>want you."
</p>
<p>"I suppose," remarked Clermont, "that my case is like this if I don't,
</p>
<p>some one else will squeal."
</p>
<p>He then gave an account of himself and his Anarchist comrades. He
</p>
<p>was subsequently released and visited me very often for several weeks.
</p>
<p>He was out of employment and hard-up, and I gave him money with which
</p>
<p>to support himself. One evening he called and said to the officers that he
</p>
<p>had something important to tell me. I was very busy at the time and asked
</p>
<p>him if he wanted some money. Victor replied that he did not desire money.
</p>
<p>I offered him $5, however, and told him to come back the next day. He
</p>
<p>would not take the money at first, but when I told him that I could not
</p>
<p>wait any longer, he took it and left. On reaching Milwaukee and Chicago
</p>
<p>Avenues, he met some of his old cronies and told them that he was going
</p>
<p>away that night. Early next morning I was informed that he had gone.
</p>
<p>Victor remained away for a year, but, thinking things had blown over, he
</p>
<p>returned and set about to disabuse the Anarchists of the impression that he
</p>
<p>had ever "squealed." While he has taken no active part in meetings since
</p>
<p>the trial, he appears to feel that he stands well with the Anarchists, and
</p>
<p>always tells them that when he" was arrested "he never gave anything
</p>
<p>away."
</p>
<p>His statement was as follows. It was given at nine o'clock on the even-
</p>
<p>ing of May 26 :
</p>
<p>" I belong to the Northwest Side Lehr und Wehr Verein, the second
</p>
<p>company, of which Breitenfeld is captain. Some time ago, at a meeting
</p>
<p>held at 54 West Lake Street, it was stated that the police would break up
</p>
<p>their meetings if they knew when and where they held them, and that there-

</p>
<p>fore it was necessary to adopt some secret way of calling their meetings.
</p>
<p>We adopted, ' Y, komme,' and when we saw that letter appear in
</p>
<p>the Arbeiter-Zeitung on any day we might know a meeting would be held at
</p>
<p>No. 54 West Lake Street. I was at Thalia Hall, May 3, early in the even-
</p>
<p>ing. We were to have held a meeting to elect new officers of the company,
</p>
<p>but no meeting was held. Some one came into the saloon and said that
</p>
<p>there were four of our workingmen killed at McCormick's factory that after-
</p>
<p>noon. Then some one said that a call for a meeting that evening at No.
</p>
<p>54 West Lake Street had been published in the Arbeiter-Zeitung, and a lot
</p>
<p>of us went there to learn further particulars about the shooting of our men.
</p>
<p>I there saw those circulars calling for revenge and the people to arms.
</p>
<p>VICTOR CLERMONT S STORY, 333
</p>
<p>That circular made me very excited. I was one of the first to get to that
</p>
<p>meeting at 54 West Lake Street. At the commencement of the meeting
</p>
<p>we put a man at each door to prevent any one listening or seeing what was
</p>
<p>going on in the inside, and to admit only members. That meeting was only
</p>
<p>called for the armed men. Waller was chairman. I heard Engel make a
</p>
<p>speech, and he presented the plan adopted by the Northwest Side group."
</p>
<p>(Here follows a detailed account of the " plan," agreeing in every particular
</p>
<p>with that given by other witnesses as to blowing up police stations, set-
</p>
<p>ting fire to buildings, killing people, the use of the word " Ruhe, " etc.)
</p>
<p>" We expected that there would be present at the Haymarket meeting from
</p>
<p>30,000 to 40,000 people and that then there would be a good chance for us
</p>
<p>to commence our revolution and attack the police and the government.
</p>
<p>There were also to be spies at the meeting to communicate with the groups
</p>
<p>in the outlying sections (Wicker Park and Lincoln Park). But the spies
</p>
<p>did not do their work, and then after Engel's speech several got to talking
</p>
<p>about guns, fires and bombs. On the motion of Fischer it was decided to
</p>
<p>have 10,000 circulars calling the Haymarket meeting printed, and he said
</p>
<p>he would attend to it. First Market Square was proposed, but some one
</p>
<p>objected by saying it was a mouse trap in case of trouble, and the Hay-
</p>
<p>market was agreed upon. Before finishing telling about his plan Engel
</p>
<p>said it had been adopted by the Northwest Side group and referred to
</p>
<p>Fischer to answer if that was not so. Fischer replied, ' Yes, that is the
</p>
<p>plan.'"
</p>
<p>I asked Clermont if that was the first time he had ever heard of the
</p>
<p>" plan," and he replied :
</p>
<p>" Yes, it was the first time I had heard of the revolutionary plan. I
</p>
<p>never heard of it before, and only heard of it through Engel that night.
</p>
<p>This was the only plan I heard of to be followed for the revolution. I was
</p>
<p>at the Haymarket and expected to find a big crowd. To my surprise I
</p>
<p>only found about five hundred present."
</p>
<p>Clermont is now again in Chicago, and as rabid a red as ever. He
</p>
<p>is a leader on the Northwest Side, and detectives have reported to me
</p>
<p>that he has declared himself in favor of " bullets instead of ballots." He

<p>THE work of ferreting out and arresting the conspirators might have
</p>
<p>stopped with the number already gathered in, so far as the necessity for
</p>
<p>procuring evidence to be used in court was concerned, but it was continued
</p>
<p>to the end that every conspicuous or minor character in the murderous plot
</p>
<p>might be made to feel the power of the law, which each had so persistently
</p>
<p>defied. I had the names and descriptions of all identified with Engel's
</p>
<p>plan, their haunts, their traits of character, and their influence in the order,
</p>
<p>and detectives, under instructions, were continually on the search. Anar-
</p>
<p>chist localities were overhauled, unfrequented places visited, and convenient
</p>
<p>hiding-places inspected. Every one wanted was finally brought from under
</p>
<p>cover. Not a guilty one escaped, except Schnaubelt. Anarchistic sympa-
</p>
<p>thizers did everything in their power to conceal their friends, but the police
</p>
<p>proved equal to the emergency.
</p>
<p>RUDOLPH DANNENBERG, a German, was one who held himself aloof from
</p>
<p>the rest of humanity. He lived at No. 218 Fulton Street, and on the 27th
</p>
<p>of May Officers Loewenstein and Whalen found him surrounded by his
</p>
<p>family. During the few moments' conversation I had with him, it became
</p>
<p>apparent that he was like all his associates a firm enemy of the existing
</p>
<p>order of society. He stated that, although he was only a tailor, he could
</p>
<p>fire a revolver as unerringly as any one and throw a bomb as far as any-
</p>
<p>body. He declared that he thought himself adapted to something higher,
</p>
<p>something better than being a tailor, and he had joined the Anarchists in
</p>
<p>order to bring himself before the public and achieve distinction. He had
</p>
<p>carefully read the Arbeiter-Zeitung, had noticed the names of various peo
</p>
<p>pie, and he did not see why he could not become great like them and see his
</p>
<p>name and deeds frequently paraded in the papers. He felt that he had the
</p>
<p>wife.

<p>requisite ability, and communicated his ambition and his desires to his
</p>
<p>Mrs. Dannenberg was a plain, unassuming woman, and did not dare to
</p>
<p>remonstrate with a man who had finally discovered his forte. He strutted
</p>
<p>about the house with the conscious pride that greatness was within his
</p>
<p>grasp, and his changed demeanor really impressed the woman to the extent
</p>
<p>A KNIGHT OF THE NEEDLE. 335
</p>
<p>that she believed he was already a great man. Dannenberg lost no time in
</p>
<p>joining the Lehr und Wehr Verein, and eagerly made the acquaintance of
</p>
<p>all the leading men in the order. He secured recognition, and his heait
</p>
<p>swelled with joy when he attended the secret meetings held by the order.
</p>
<p>All these little confessions were adroitly extracted by piecemeal. Noticing
</p>
<p>that here was a man who felt himself above the " goose " and the needle, I
</p>
<p>concluded to send him below to discover, if he could, the difference between
</p>
<p>being a tailor and an Anarchist in search of greatness. I treated him with
</p>
<p>perfect indifference, and he seemed to feel the indignity greatly. He was
</p>
<p>put in a cell, and for two days no one went near him except the janitor.
</p>
<p>Dannenberg finally got uneasy and sent word that he desired to see me.
</p>
<p>He was informed in return that he would be sent to the County Jail the
</p>
<p>next day. He then wanted to know if he would not be given an oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity to speak, and insisted on having a hearing. He was brought into
</p>
<p>the office and told that he would be given just five minutes to tell what he
</p>
<p>had to say.
</p>
<p>"Gentlemen," he said, in great haste, "you think because I am a tailor
</p>
<p>I am of no account, and consequently you seem disposed to punish me.
</p>
<p>My oath is just as good as the other fellows'."
</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" I inquired. "We have not asked you for your
</p>
<p>oath, and we do not want it."
</p>
<p>"Oh, I see now," said Rudolph, beginning to get angry, "you only want
</p>
<p>the small fry. Well, look here, Captain, I don't give a continental. I will
</p>
<p>tell on the other big fellows, now, for the fun of the thing. They must be
</p>
<p>punished as well as the little fellows. It is evident that the other big fellows
</p>
<p>want to talk themselves out."
</p>
<p>" I think you have got the thing down very fine," were my consoling
</p>
<p>words.
</p>
<p>" Yes, I know the people want to hang somebody," said Rudolph, " and
</p>
<p>if they can only hang a tailor they will be satisfied."
</p>
<p>Time was called on the speaker, the five minutes having been exhausted,
</p>
<p>and Rudolph was about to be escorted down stairs.
</p>
<p>"Stop ! stop ! officer, I have not commenced yet to talk, and I want to
</p>
<p>be heard."

<p>"Well," said I, "you want to commence very soon."
</p>
<p>Dannenberg again planted himself firmly in his chair, and then proceeded
</p>
<p>to relieve himself of the burden on his mind. He gave quite an interesting
</p>
<p>statement, and was subsequently released by order of the State's Attorney.
</p>
<p>He was indicted for murder before his release, and he left after promising
</p>
<p>to report when wanted. Some time after he was rearrested and put in a
</p>
<p>room with fifteen others.

<p>Every one of these fifteen was morose, sullen and dejected. There was

<p>and took a gloomy view of life. The presence of Dannenberg was like a
</p>
<p>cheerful fire in a blizzard. He had forgotten all about the misfortune of
</p>
<p>being a tailor and a crushed Anarchist, and he kept the company full of life
</p>
<p>with his wit and drollery.
</p>
<p>On his final release, Dannenberg went back to his trade, quit Anarchy,
</p>
<p>and now takes the greatest sort of pride in telling his friends that he is sim-
</p>
<p>ply a " knight of the needle."
</p>
<p>After stating his age to be thirty-two years, Dannenberg swore :
</p>
<p>" I went to the meeting in the basement at No. 54 West Lake Street. I
</p>
<p>heard Engel speak. I heard Fischer say that he would attend to the print-
</p>
<p>ing of the circulars for the Haymarket meeting. I used to belong to the
</p>
<p>Lehr und Wehr Verein, but I quit two months ago. I was at Thalia Hall,
</p>
<p>on Milwaukee Avenue, Sunday, May ad. I used to go there very often. I
</p>
<p>know George Engel. At the meeting at No. 54 West Lake Street, he was
</p>
<p>called on for a speech, and he responded. I heard him speak of his plan
</p>
<p>a plan for riots, fires, the destruction of buildings and property, and the
</p>
<p>killing of people and the police. I heard him speak of the meeting to be
</p>
<p>held at the Haymarket, and that, if they started there, then would be the
</p>
<p>time for us to commence the rebellion all over the city. A man named
</p>
<p>Schrade, sitting by my side, remarked to me that Engel had made a very
</p>
<p>destructive speech. This talk made me laugh. Engel continued by saying
</p>
<p>that when we saw the heavens red, then was our time to commence. The
</p>
<p>Northwest Side group, he said, would meet at Wicker Park, and the North
</p>
<p>Side group at Lincoln Park. The moment we saw the fires, as a signal,
</p>
<p>then we should throw bombs, shoot down the policemen and everybody
</p>
<p>who stood in our way, and begin the general destruction of property and
</p>
<p>life. I never heard of this plan before this time. Engel was the only one
</p>
<p>who spoke of the plan. At this meeting I knew Breitenfeld and Waller,
</p>
<p>who was chairman. I heard some one at that meeting ask for dynamite
</p>
<p>bombs and how to get them, and some said : ' You ought to know it by this
</p>
<p>time.' Engel also spoke of the word ' Ruhe.' It was to be a signal word,
</p>
<p>and when it should appear in the Arbeiter-Zeitung, then was the time to be
</p>
<p>ready for a riot."

<p>He might have been gathered in long before, but he was kept under watch
</p>
<p>in the hopes of bagging a more important Anarchist. It was known that
</p>
<p>English was a particular friend of Schnaubelt's, and the officers kept their
</p>
<p>eye on him continually, thinking the bomb-thrower might be found through
</p>
<p>his unconscious intervention. But they waited and watched in vain, and
</p>
<p>finally Officers Palmer and Cosgrove arrested English on suspicion. He
</p>
<p>was turned over to me, and then it was ascertained that he knew more of
</p>
<p>the Anarchists in Pullman, where he worked, than he did of those in Chi-
</p>
<p>cago. When called an Anarchist he objected, and insisted that he was
</p>
<p>simply a Socialist a distinction without a difference in his case. He
</p>
<p>stated, however, that all the Anarchists in America "looked upon Chicago
</p>
<p>as the main center of Anarchy," and in Pullman they got all their inspira-
</p>
<p>tion from Chicago. He acknowledged an acquaintance with Muntzenberg,
</p>
<p>338 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>who, he said, had sold John Most's books and other Anarchistic literature
</p>
<p>at Pullman. Muntzenberg had been in Pullman after the 4th of May, and
</p>
<p>had carried dynamite bombs with him. The Socialists, said English, had
</p>
<p>become frightened at this exhibition and had refrained from having any
</p>
<p>further dealings with Muntzenberg.
</p>
<p>English was allowed to go, with an injunction that he had better stay in
</p>
<p>Pullman, where he belonged. He has since remained at home and is now
</p>
<p>giving more of his time to the study of sound literature on economic sub-
</p>
<p>jects. He came to America from Germany, in October, 1885, and was led
</p>
<p>astray by Most's writings. Had he lived in Chicago he would have been
</p>
<p>a very handy man for Lingg. In the old country he had worked in the
</p>
<p>manufacture of torpedoes, etc., for the Government, and he was well posted
</p>
<p>on explosives. He was twenty-four years of age, and just such a man as
</p>
<p>Lingg could have utilized.
</p>
<p>AUGUST KRAEMER, a German, thought he was sharper than the police.
</p>
<p>He had escaped their attentions, and he was felicitating himself that he
</p>
<p>knew how to elude them successfully. One day, however June ist he
</p>
<p>was cheerfully greeted by Officers Whalen and Stift, and when they notified
</p>
<p>him of the pleasure his company would give us at the station, he became
</p>
<p>motionless with surprise. Recovering himself, he declared that it was an
</p>
<p>awful outrage to arrest a man for nothing and assured the officers again
</p>
<p>and again that he had never heard of Socialists or Anarchists, did not know
</p>
<p>a single one of that class and would not be able to recognize one if pointed
</p>
<p>out to him. In fact, he had not even heard that a bomb had been thrown
</p>
<p>at the Haymarket. He played this role of ignorance when brought before
</p>
<p>me, but I soon brought him to his senses.
</p>
<p>"You have played the old lady long enough," I said. "We are men
</p>
<p>here who do not believe a word you say, and don't want any of your tea-
</p>
<p>party stories. Is not George Engel your friend ? Did you not drink beer
</p>
<p>in Engel's rear room, May 4th, about eleven o'clock ? Were you not there
</p>
<p>when a lot of men waited for orders to blow up and burn down houses ?
</p>
<p>Were you not at the Haymarket with Engel, and did you not walk around
</p>
<p>with him on the outskirts of the crowd?"
</p>
<p>"Who told you this?" came promptly from Kraemer.

<p>"One of those little gods you prayed to at Thalia Hall on Sundays.
</p>
<p>Why, you hypocrite, you and twenty more get together, talk and give your
</p>
<p>opinions about dynamite and how to construct poisoned daggers, and work
</p>
<p>out a plan to fight the police and militia, drink beer and liquor, and call that
</p>
<p>a prayer-meeting. What have you to say to all this ? If you can not an-
</p>
<p>swer I will give it to you plainer."
</p>
<p>"Mein Gott, some one wants to hang me," exclaimed August. "I know
</p>
<p>Herr Engel ; he is a good man."
</p>
<p>"Yes, in your estimation."
</p>
<p>A WILLING WITNESS. 339
</p>
<p>" If you only knew how awfully sorry he felt for the officers that were
</p>
<p>killed."
</p>
<p>" Oh, yes. Well, do you now think that we know something about you ? "
</p>
<p>" I admit that you know all about me, but Herr Engel said that night
</p>
<p>that it was wrong to have such a miscarriage. He did not believe in kill-
</p>
<p>ing a few people. All revolutions, Engel believed, ought to come about by
</p>
<p>themselves, and then the police and soldiers would be with them. If the
</p>
<p>people would fight, then the authorities, police and all, would throw their
</p>
<p>guns away and run. Then the victory would be won without spilling any
</p>
<p>blood, but such a foolish thing as the Haymarket affair Engel would have
</p>
<p>nothing to do with."
</p>
<p>"Yes; all this Engel said after 10:30 o'clock that night, May 4th."
</p>
<p>"Yes, he said it in his back room."
</p>
<p>"That is all I want of you. Officers, lock up this dynamitard."
</p>
<p>"Captain, will you not let me make a statement? "
</p>
<p>"Of what?"
</p>
<p>" I know something. For God's sake don't lock me up."
</p>
<p>"Well, then, speak, double-quick time, and let there be no lying."
</p>
<p>Kraemer calmed himself and proceeded to unfold his story. He was
</p>
<p>subsequently released on promising to testify in court and that he would
</p>
<p>become a better man. He was indicted by the grand jury for conspiracy to
</p>
<p>murder. He was not asked to testify, and it was supposed that after all his
</p>
<p>troubles he would attend strictly to his own business, that of a carpenter.
</p>
<p>Not so. He was to be found in the company of the worst Anarchists
</p>
<p>between May 4th and the time of the execution, but, when he finally discov-
</p>
<p>ered that there was a law in the State to hang conspirators and murderers,
</p>
<p>he grew frightened. He now remains at home instead of skulking into
</p>
<p>dark cellars and devising means of revenge. He lived, at the time of his
</p>
<p>arrest, at No. 286 Milwaukee Avenue, in the rear, his friend Engel occupy-
</p>
<p>ing the front part of the building. He was thirty-three years of age, mar-
</p>
<p>ried, well built, five feet eight inches in height, and an active man
</p>
<p>His statement was as follows :
</p>
<p>" I attended the meeting at No. 54 West Lake Street the night of May
</p>
<p>3d. I was there about fifteen minutes when the meeting was called to order.

</p>
<p>Some one suggested that every man of a group should see that every one
</p>
<p>present was one of their members. I was asked what group I belonged to.
</p>
<p>I could not tell. I do not belong to any group. Then I was told to go out
</p>
<p>because I could not give the pass-word. I told them that I belonged to the
</p>
<p>Socialists, but they told me I could not remain. I then went away. I
</p>
<p>have often been at Thalia Hall at the ' Bible class,' I met there frequently
</p>
<p>Engel and Fischer. That was in the month of April, 1886. At one meet-
</p>
<p>ing, when Engel and Fischer were present, some one called on the people
</p>
<p>to be ready with arms : that the time would soon come when they must be
</p>
<p>organized and ready to defend themselves. While I was at 54 West Lake
</p>
<p>Street that evening, May 3, some one complained that there were so few
</p>
<p>340 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>present and said that there had always been a good attendance until that
</p>
<p>night, and that it was very strange. As I could not give the sign I was put
</p>
<p>out. I heard Engel say that no revolution could be a success with only a
</p>
<p>small group ; there must be general, united action."
</p>
<p>MARTIN BECHTEL was also requested to report at the station for an inter-
</p>
<p>view. He willingly responded, and conversed quite freely. He was a
</p>
<p>beer-brewer by profession, and on May 4 was foreman in the brewery of
</p>
<p>Bartholomae & Leicht. He was also president of the Brewers' Union and
</p>
<p>presided at a meeting on the afternoon of May 3. His statement of that
</p>
<p>meeting was as follows :
</p>
<p>" I had a meeting called of the brewers for that afternoon, and there I
</p>
<p>saw a lot of those ' Revenge ' circulars. I saw all the men reading them,
</p>
<p>and, while some did not appear to care much, others got greatly excited
</p>
<p>over the way the police had been clubbing the people at McCormick's fac-
</p>
<p>tory. There was considerable excitement for awhile, and this was kept up
</p>
<p>until I called the meeting to order. I found that I had to be very strict
</p>
<p>before I could do anything. We transacted our business with great diffi-
</p>
<p>culty. I was interrupted now and then by some one coming in and talking
</p>
<p>excitedly about the police killing people at the factory. I restored order
</p>
<p>once more, when Oscar Neebe came in with a new supply of circulars and
</p>
<p>handed them around to the boys. Then the fire was in the straw again.
</p>
<p>After Neebe had distributed his circulars, he was called on for a speech,
</p>
<p>and whenever he was asked by any one if it was true that the police had
</p>
<p>been killing people in the manner described by the circular, he would
</p>
<p>answer : ' Oh, yes ; I know it is true. I saw it all. We must get ready
</p>
<p>and take revenge. Get ready ; you all know what to do. You have all
</p>
<p>been to our meetings ; you have all had instructions. Come out like men
</p>
<p>and show the capitalists what you are made of. Show these bloodhounds,
</p>
<p>these hirelings of the capitalists I mean the blue-coated police that we
</p>
<p>are not afraid of them. We must meet them and teach them a lesson.
</p>
<p>They have no regard for you or your families. You must feel the same to
</p>
<p>them.' Such was the character of his speech and replies, and that is all I
</p>
<p>can report of the meeting."
</p>
<p>Mr. Bechtel was thanked for his information, and left the office.

</p>
<p>It came out that during that day, after leaving that meeting, Neebe
</p>
<p>went into a saloon on Clark Street, near Division, and said that "by to-
</p>
<p>morrow or before to-morrow midnight the city of Chicago would swim in
</p>
<p>blood, or perhaps lie in ashes." There would be a revolution, everything
</p>
<p>was ready, and he said that he would do his share of the work. At one
</p>
<p>time he was so wrought up with excitement that he fairly shouted at the
</p>
<p>top of his voice and made loud threats. In the trial, it was a fortunate
</p>
<p>thing for Neebe that certain documents were not at hand, or he would have
</p>
<p>undoubtedly been hung instead of being let off with the fifteen years' sen-
</p>
<p>tence in the penitentiary which he is now working out. The documents
</p>
<p>desired were in some manner lost, and, when some of the material witnesses
</p>
<p>were looked for to appear at the trial, they could not be found.
</p>
<p>THE "COMMUNISTEN-BUDE." 341
</p>
<p>Neebe knew perfectly well the character of the men he addressed at the
</p>
<p>brewers' meeting. They were all fire-eaters on the question of Anarchy,
</p>
<p>and the name of the Brewers' Union was simply adopted as a cloak. The
</p>
<p>brewing companies could greatly contribute to the promotion of law, order
</p>
<p>and decency by replacing every one of them with men who appreciate good
</p>
<p>government and the privileges of citizenship.
</p>
<p>In one brewery on the North Side, these " reds " managed to get the
</p>
<p>teamsters and beer-peddlers inoculated with their heresy, and the result was
</p>
<p>that the police were often called upon to quell disturbances growing either
</p>
<p>out of arguments with customers or saloon patrons. The injury thus done
</p>
<p>to the trade of the company must have been large. Is it a fear of these
</p>
<p>men or is there a lack of better material that keeps them in their places ?
</p>
<p>It is certain that such men are doing the brewing companies no good.
</p>
<p>They are a bad lot and need watching. They are watched.
</p>
<p>MORITZ NEFF was the owner of what has been called the "Shanty of
</p>
<p>the Communists," at No. 58 Clybourn Avenue, known also as " Neff's Hall."
</p>
<p>He was intimate with the leaders of Anarchy and knew a great deal about
</p>
<p>their movements. On the ist of June, Schuettler and Stift were sent to
</p>
<p>tell him that I desired to see him. He came, not under arrest, but volun-
</p>
<p>tarily, as soon as he had secured some one to run his saloon during his
</p>
<p>absence. He was a German, about thirty-six years of age, unmarried, and
</p>
<p>had kept the Anarchist headquarters for over seven years. He attended
</p>
<p>closely to business, rented his hall in the rear of the saloon to various unions
</p>
<p>and clubs, and made plenty of money. His place was a sort of " go-as-you-
</p>
<p>please " headquarters for the Anarchists, and if all their plottings there had
</p>
<p>been carried into execution the city of Chicago would not now stand as a
</p>
<p>monument of thrift, energy, enterprise and wealth. The hall was rented to
</p>
<p>any one who desired it. No questions were asked, and no publicity was
</p>
<p>ever given to the proceedings through Neff. He could keep secrets, and
</p>
<p>the Anarchists knew it. He also knew them thoroughly. He was a good
</p>
<p>judge of character, and, as most of his patrons were low-browed, ignorant
</p>
<p>and impulsive fellows, he would in the presence of some of the more sensi-
</p>
<p>ble ones call them "fools and cattle." Neff gave up his money freely to
</p>
<p>these people for the advancement of their cause, but he was never known

</p>
<p>to howl against law and order or make threats against capitalists, like other
</p>
<p>Anarchist saloon-keepers. He always kept on friendly terms with the
</p>
<p>police, and promised Lieutenant Baus to keep him posted whenever any-
</p>
<p>thing of importance transpired. This promise, however, seems to have
</p>
<p>been shrewdly made with a view to "pulling the wool over the eyes" of
</p>
<p>the Lieutenant. Neff would say, " Don't trouble yourself. Whenever there
</p>
<p>is anything going on, I will put you on ; " but he never found anything worth
</p>
<p>while reporting. The officers managed to gather a good deal of information
</p>
<p>respecting the character of the meetings held, but, as no important or dan-
</p>
<p>342 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>gerous results were ever expected to grow out of them, the Anarchists were
</p>
<p>permitted to remain unmolested.
</p>
<p>On the night of May 4, after the Anarchists had been put to rout, those
</p>
<p>of the North Side group hastened from their various posts to meet at Neff's
</p>
<p>place. They were still inclined to go on with the revolution, and Neff
</p>
<p>reproached them for not continuing it the moment it was started.
</p>
<p>"What the d 1," said he, "did you carry bombs for all night and not
</p>
<p>do anything ? Why didn't you go to the Chicago Avenue Station and blow
</p>
<p>the d d building to h 1 with every one in it ? "
</p>
<p>This staggered the hot-heads, and not one made a reply.
</p>
<p>" Why," continued Neff, "you are all cowards ; not one of you dare go
</p>
<p>with me now."
</p>
<p>No one advanced to accept the challenge. Presently, the hour getting
</p>
<p>near eleven o'clock, Neff said :
</p>
<p>" Get out ! I am going to close up, and to-morrow we will have different
</p>
<p>music, and we will see who dances."
</p>
<p>Knowing the great resort his place had been lor Anarchists, Neff was in
</p>
<p>momentary dread of becoming involved in the Haymarket affair. He was
</p>
<p>very uneasy, and, as described by an acquaintance of his, " his clothes and
</p>
<p>shirt collar did not fit him very well for a number of days." When he
</p>
<p>entered my office, Neff straightened up and appeared as if his mind was
</p>
<p>made up for the worst and as if he had resolved that the police should be
</p>
<p>no wiser through any information he possessed. It was not long, however,
</p>
<p>before he discovered that we meant business, and that playing the fool in
</p>
<p>the matter would not be tolerated. In the room were Assistant State's
</p>
<p>Attorney Furthmann, six detectives and myself, and he was kept busy
</p>
<p>framing answers that would not compromise himself. Finally Neff looked
</p>
<p>us all over very carefully and said :
</p>
<p>" I know I am called here to answer questions and tell on the Anar-
</p>
<p>chists. I will now tell all I know."
</p>
<p>He then gave a straightforward story and appeared as a witness at the
</p>
<p>trial, giving all its substantial points. After that trial he sold out his place
</p>
<p>and left the city. He remained away for a time, but recently came to-
</p>
<p>Chicago on a visit. His conduct has been such as to justify the hope that

<p>he will hereafter hold himself aloof from Anarchists.
</p>
<p>JOHN WEIMAN, a Suabian, was a peculiar genius. He was only twenty-
</p>
<p>three years of age, and yet he imagined that he could successfully hood-
</p>
<p>wink the police. He had been pointed out as an associate of some of the lead-
</p>
<p>ers, and it was decided to bring him to see what he had to say for himself. He
</p>
<p>lived at No. 30 Barker Street, and when notified, about the 6th of June, that
</p>
<p>I wished to become acquainted with him, he assumed a highly injured air.
</p>
<p>The moment he set foot inside the office, he threw up both hands and, in a
</p>
<p>loud voice, 'insisted that a great mistake had been made in arresting him.

</p>
<p>344 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS
</p>
<p>" I am no Socialist, no Anarchist, no Nihilist, no Communist," he
</p>
<p>declared. " I don't know Spies, Parsons, Schwab, Fischer, Lingg, Engel,
</p>
<p>Neebe or Fielden. I never attended any meetings at No. 54, No. 71 or
</p>
<p>No. 120 West Lake Street, and I have never been in the Communisten-
</p>
<p>Bude [the Shanty of the Communists] at No. 58 Clybourn Avenue ;
</p>
<p>never was at Mueller's Hall basement, or at Thalia Hall, or at No. 63
</p>
<p>Emma Street."
</p>
<p>"That is right, John," said I. " Keep on and tell me a few more places
</p>
<p>where you have never been, and I shall be much obliged to you. Then I will
</p>
<p>know all the places and all the leaders of the whole Anarchist outfit."
</p>
<p>" Yes," said John, " I have heard of you, and I don't want to be troubled
</p>
<p>too much. I know that you are acquainted with all those places and know
</p>
<p>all the people who went there, and I heard of a lot of people getting arrested
</p>
<p>every day who knew all the leaders and frequented those meeting-places.
</p>
<p>I thought I would tell you all at first, because I am sick and I can't stand
</p>
<p>much talking-to."
</p>
<p>" How came you to know so much ? " I inquired ; " that is to say, how
</p>
<p>do you know the names of the members ? "
</p>
<p>"Well, I have a friend, and he told me all these things, but he ran away
</p>
<p>from the city. I don't know where he is now."
</p>
<p>" What is his name and where did he live ? "
</p>
<p>" He is a carpenter. I used to call him Carl. He lived on Randolph
</p>
<p>Street, near Union."
</p>
<p>Further inquiries failed to elicit anything of importance, and he was
</p>
<p>turned loose to wander at his own sweet pleasure.
</p>
<p>EMIL MENDE, a German, was a man thoroughly capable of desperate
</p>
<p>deeds. He lived at No. 51 Meagher Street, and so villainous a disposition
</p>
<p>did he possess that his own sister and his brother-in-law were obliged to
</p>
<p>report him at the station. Even the people in his own neighborhood feared
</p>
<p>him, and those that knew him best shunned him. He was a dangerous man.
</p>
<p>For two months preceding May 4, he boasted how the Anarchists would
</p>
<p>blow up the city and kill every one who was not an Anarchist. He talked
</p>
<p>about it so often and in such an earnest way that his neighbors grew appre-
</p>
<p>hensive lest he might set fire to the neighborhood. The children would run

</p>
<p>across the street to avoid meeting him. He was always* full of liquor, and
</p>
<p>his chief study was how to get a living without work. He thought he had
</p>
<p>found it in Anarchy, and he stood ready to commit any crime to accomplish
</p>
<p>his purpose. He became a drunken loafer through attending Anarchistic
</p>
<p>meetings, and when his sister remonstrated with him he turned against her
</p>
<p>and threatened to kill her. His conduct finally became so unbearable that
</p>
<p>his brother-in-law, Emil Sauer, gave information against him to the police.
</p>
<p>Mende, he said, belonged to the Lehr und Wehr Verein of the Southwest
</p>
<p>Side group and would assemble with his comrades in lonely, retired places,
</p>
<p>A VILLAINOUS SPECIMEN. 345
</p>
<p>where the police could not see them drill. They would sneak into the build-
</p>
<p>ings selected for their meeting-places, and after their drills they would
</p>
<p>quietly sneak out again, like so many thieves who had committed a success-
</p>
<p>ful burglary. Sauer said he had come to know many of the members, but
</p>
<p>he did not know their names or where they lived. They all had numbers,
</p>
<p>were well armed with rifles and revolvers, and they drilled frequently.
</p>
<p>" I remember the night of May 4," said Sauer, " Mende left the house
</p>
<p>about eight o'clock. He looked wild and desperate. He carried with him
</p>
<p>a huge revolver and a lot of cartridges. About eleven o'clock the same
</p>
<p>evening, after the bomb had exploded, he came sneaking home, and had in
</p>
<p>his possession two rifles and three dynamite bombs. He brought them all
</p>
<p>into the house at first, and, becoming alarmed, he took them all to No. 647
</p>
<p>South Canal Street. There he was seen either going under the house or
</p>
<p>under the sidewalk. When he came out he had nothing with him. Mende,
</p>
<p>when he first began to attend the meetings, had very little to say about
</p>
<p>Anarchy. He kept on, and during the six months preceding the Haymarket
</p>
<p>riot he was perfectly crazy on the subject. After he had become a member
</p>
<p>of the armed group, he would speak of nothing else but killing people and
</p>
<p>destroying the city. On the evening of May 4, before leaving home, he
</p>
<p>said :
</p>
<p>' ' ' This is our night. This night we will show our strength. I would like
</p>
<p>to see any one oppose us. Nothing can stand before us. Before daylight
</p>
<p>to-morrow blood will flow deep in the streets, and the air will be hot. Then
</p>
<p>we will have a new government.'
</p>
<p>" After he had been gone about twenty minutes, some one came in and
</p>
<p>asked for him. The man looked like a starved-out cut-throat. He was told
</p>
<p>that Mende had gone. The fellow remarked, ' Then it is all right. I know
</p>
<p>where to find him.' He pulled his hat over his eyes, turned up his coat col-
</p>
<p>lar and disappeared. This man was watched. He went west from our
</p>
<p>house, and about a block away he met five other men. They all went west
</p>
<p>together.
</p>
<p>" On the afternoon of May 4, Mende said to me :
</p>
<p>" ' I want you to go with us. Everything is very well planned. There
</p>
<p>is no fear that we will not get all the help we want after we have started.

<p>We are going to move like an army. If we should get whipped at first, or
</p>
<p>if we should have to run, then we all have places to go to. The Southwest
</p>
<p>Side group is going to a church on Eighteenth Street, and we will fortify
</p>
<p>ourselves there until we get help. We will have a lot of dynamite bombs

<p>to keep everybody away. We have rifles and revolvers, and no one will
</p>
<p>dare come near us. We can hold the fort there for a few days, and no one
</p>
<p>will trouble us. Only throw out a bomb once a day, and that will be suffi-
</p>
<p>cient to prevent the enemy from coming near. The North Side group is going
</p>
<p>to follow our plan. They are going to take charge of St. Michael's Church.

</p>
<p>We have things down fine. You had better come along. There is no dan-
</p>
<p>ger. We expect a lot of people here from Michigan and all the mining
</p>
<p>towns. They will all come here as soon as we begin the attack.'
</p>
<p>"Mende asked me at one time to go with him, this was during the
</p>
<p>McCormick strike, and told me they were going to take with them tin
</p>
<p>cans, which would be filled with kerosene. These cans would have strong
</p>
<p>corks in them, and through each a hole had been drilled, for the insertion of
</p>
<p>a cap and fuse. They would simply light the fuse, throw the can into a
</p>
<p>lumber yard, and walk off. No one would discover who did it, and then
</p>
<p>they would see a big fire. ' In this way we'll bring these d d capitalists
</p>
<p>to time.' I told Mende that I would have nothing to do with him or his
</p>
<p>plans.
</p>
<p>" Two days after the bomb had been thrown, he said to me :
</p>
<p>'"I know the man who threw the bomb, and, you bet, he is a good friend
</p>
<p>of mine. He will never be arrested.'
</p>
<p>" About eight days after the explosion, he told me that he knew the man
</p>
<p>who made bombs, and that the man was going to leave the city. This man,
</p>
<p>he also said, had changed his clothes, and he (Mende) had got the clothes
</p>
<p>from a man named Sisterer, who lived on Sixteenth Street. I then asked
</p>
<p>him the name of the man who made the bombs, and he said it was Louis
</p>
<p>Lingg."
</p>
<p>Mrs. Sauer next related her grievances against her brother.
</p>
<p>"This brute," she began, "not being satisfied with having all the neigh-
</p>
<p>bors afraid of him, had to torment the life out of me, telling me that he
</p>
<p>belonged to those fellows who would kill, give no quarter and take none.
</p>
<p>In a fight the result would be victory or death. He would tell me that as
</p>
<p>soon as they had established their government the children of the capitalists
</p>
<p>would he hunted up and killed, and every trace of a capitalist wiped off the
</p>
<p>face of the earth. My brother reads all kinds of Anarchist books and
</p>
<p>papers. I saw him have a big revolver and a lot of cartridges, and he said :
</p>
<p>" ' We are going to kill all the police now in a few days. They all must be
</p>
<p>killed. They stand in our way. We cannot get our rights so long as we
</p>
<p>let those bloodhounds live. So we have decided to kill them all. We are
</p>
<p>ready now, and you will not see any more of those fellows hanging around

</p>
<p>the corners.'
</p>
<p>" He also said that the Fire Department was a well-organized body, and
</p>
<p>they, too, must be destroyed.
</p>
<p>"'Before the battle commences,' he said, 'we are going to fix the
</p>
<p>bridges with dynamite, so that, in case the Fire Department should come
</p>
<p>to the relief of the police or go to work to extinguish the fires that we start,
</p>
<p>we will blow the bridges, firemen, horses and all to h 1.'
</p>
<p>" He further stated that the city would be set on fire in all parts, so that
</p>
<p>the police and firemen would be obliged to stay in their own neighborhoods,
</p>
<p>A SISTERS ACCUSATION. 347
</p>
<p>and it would be impossible for any large bodies of them to get together in
</p>
<p>one place. Then, when everything was in confusion, they had places selected
</p>
<p>where they would meet in a body and come into the center of the city, where
</p>
<p>they would rob and plunder every jewelry store and bank, and places where
</p>
<p>they could get the most valuable things they wanted.
</p>
<p>" 'We have,' he said, 'all these places picked out already. We have on
</p>
<p>hand all the dynamite we want, and when we make a start we will have our
</p>
<p>tools and materials with us.'
</p>
<p>"A few days after the 4th of May, my brother also said that it was too
</p>
<p>bad that their committee had become split up during the charge of the
</p>
<p>police at the Haymarket. They failed to get together again, and the men
</p>
<p>on the outside were expecting every second to receive orders from that
</p>
<p>committee to commence setting fires and killing people. He stated that
</p>
<p>on that night he was at the Hinman Street Station, and that it was sur-
</p>
<p>rounded by seventy-five men, fifty of them having rifles and the balance
</p>
<p>large revolvers and dynamite bombs. They waited in an alley for orders.
</p>
<p>Everything, he said, was complete ; every man had his place and knew what
</p>
<p>work he had to perform. They only needed the signal from the committee.
</p>
<p>The plan was that, as soon as they had received their orders, some of them
</p>
<p>should get near the windows of the station and throw in bombs among the
</p>
<p>policemen. Then others were to be ready with their revolvers and shoot
</p>
<p>down any officer who had not been killed by the explosion and who attempted
</p>
<p>to save himself by jumping out through the window. The fifty men with
</p>
<p>rifles were to have placed themselves in front of the station, and as soon as
</p>
<p>the officers made an attempt to march out, they should kill them in the
</p>
<p>hallway before they could get outside. 'But,' said he, 'the officers at this
</p>
<p>station will be killed yet, because they have interfered with us and injured
</p>
<p>the success of the strikers.'
</p>
<p>"He spoke also about their going to barricade themselves in churches,
</p>
<p>if they got whipped, until they had secured help. He said that they had a lot
</p>
<p>of bombs buried near the city, and they were there still for future use.
</p>
<p>'They will not spoil,' he said. My brother further told me one night that
</p>
<p>he had to run home or he would have been arrested. I saw him come
</p>
<p>home, and he looked very much excited. He went into the back yard

<p>just like the coward and remained there for some time. Later he told
</p>
<p>me that a lot of them went together to blow up a freight-house with dyna-
</p>
<p>mite bombs. This freight-house is on the corner of Meagher and Jefferson
</p>
<p>Streets. He said that he had the place picked out, and everything was
</p>
<p>ready. Then one of their number, who stood guard, gave the signal to run,
</p>
<p>and they all ran away. They had a meeting-place appointed in case they
</p>
<p>should be disturbed, and there they met afterwards. They decided to
</p>
<p>renew the attack, but finally, at the suggestion of a man named Sisterer,
</p>
<p>that they postpone it till another night, they all went home. On his way

<p>HOPES OF HABEAS CORPUS. 349
</p>
<p>home my brother thought that some detective was following him. He
</p>
<p>became frightened and started on the run, and ran until he arrived home
</p>
<p>safely."
</p>
<p>When a sister would tell such a story, fully corroborated by others, of a
</p>
<p>brother, it can easily be seen that he must have been a desperate man. It
</p>
<p>must be borne in mind that about the time Mrs. Sauer notified me of her
</p>
<p>brother's acts the city was wrought up to a high pitch of excitement over
</p>
<p>the .foul murder at the Haymarket, and there was a general sentiment that
</p>
<p>all the conspirators identified with that plot ought to hang. It required,
</p>
<p>therefore, no little courage on the part of a sister to give up her own
</p>
<p>brother to take his chances on the charges made.
</p>
<p>Mende must have reached a very low, or rather a very high standing
</p>
<p>among the bloodthirsty bandits, and the revelations concerning him showed
</p>
<p>that he was not only capable of tormenting a poor woman by his savage
</p>
<p>threats, but willing and anxious to distinguish himself in any wild carnival
</p>
<p>of riot, bloodshed and incendiarism. He was a man the police wanted, and
</p>
<p>he was accordingly arrested by Officers Whalen and Loewenstein on the
</p>
<p>7th of June. At the station he gave his age as twenty-nine years, and his
</p>
<p>occupation as that of a carpenter. He was tall, well-built, wore a heavy
</p>
<p>beard and weighed about 160 pounds. His appearance did not belie the
</p>
<p>statements made about him, and subsequent inquiries showed that he was
</p>
<p>all his sister had represented him to be. What he had told his sister about
</p>
<p>the arrangements around the Hinman Street Station was found to be
</p>
<p>strictly true, and the details about the riot at the Haymarket and the
</p>
<p>signal to the armed men in the outlying sections of the city were borne
</p>
<p>out by the statements of other Anarchists.
</p>
<p>While on his way to the station, Mende seemed perfectly indifferent to
</p>
<p>his fate. It came out, however, that much of his stoical air had been
</p>
<p>inspired by statements previously communicated to him by his Anarchist
</p>
<p>associates. The attorneys of the Anarchists, Messrs. Salomon & Zeisler,
</p>
<p>had advised the order that in case of arrest the distressed brother should
</p>
<p>seek to notify some friend they might meet while being taken through the
</p>
<p>streets to the station, and then, the information being brought to them,
</p>
<p>they would at once secure a release on a writ of habeas corpus. Mende

</p>
<p>acted on this advice. He knew probably, like the rest, that, once locked
</p>
<p>up, his chances for communicating with his friends for a day or two would
</p>
<p>be exceedingly doubtful, and so, while he was being marched through the
</p>
<p>streets, he encountered a friend and told him his name ; and that friend
</p>
<p>immediately rushed to the office of the attorneys and gave the name of the
</p>
<p>prisoner and the station to which he was being taken.
</p>
<p>Mende had scarcely been locked up when the counsel came to the Chi-
</p>
<p>cago Avenue Station and demanded to see the prisoirer. They were
</p>
<p>refused. On the next day they applied for a writ of habeas corpus and
</p>
<p>350 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>wanted the prisoner brought into court. The object of this was to put me
</p>
<p>on the stand in the case, and, by various questions, to obtain such informa-
</p>
<p>tion as the State might possess with reference to the Anarchists. I was
</p>
<p>.not to be caught in such a trap, and State's Attorney Grinnell decided to
</p>
<p>/release the prisoner, have him indicted and subsequently re-arrested.
</p>
<p>During the short time Mende was at the station he was plied with ques-
</p>
<p>tions, but he answered them all with denials. He said that he had never
</p>
<p>spoken to his sister about Anarchy and had never belonged to any organ-
</p>
<p>ization. Under cross-fire, however, he admitted that he had attended the
</p>
<p>meetings and owned a big revolver. The revolver, he said, he had sold to
</p>
<p>one Peter Mann about the ist of June. After his experience at the station
</p>
<p>he was, as might have been expected, at war with his relatives, but he kept
</p>
<p>.away from meetings.
</p>
<p>POLIKARP SISTERER, a German Pole, was an associate of Mende, but,
</p>
<p>unlike that rapscallion, he was not violent or demonstrative. Having a
</p>
<p>iamily may have done much toward tempering his disposition, but still he
</p>
<p>-was an Anarchist in the full sense of the word. He was a quiet, deep-
</p>
<p>plotting fellow, and perhaps on that account might be regarded as really a
</p>
<p>more dangerous man. He was a sober man, not given to beer-drinking
</p>
<p>.and wine-guzzling like Mende ; and, like Cassius of old, had a "lean and
</p>
<p>hungry look," bringing him within that class concerning whom the injunc-
</p>
<p>tion " Beware " might well be heeded in any special crisis. He was
</p>
<p>arrested on the 8th of June by Officers Whalen and Loewenstein and taken
</p>
<p>to the station. On the way thither he, like Mende, communicated his
</p>
<p>troubles to friends on the street, and was subsequently released under the
</p>
<p>same conditions. At the station he gave his age as thirty-one years, his
</p>
<p>occupation as that of a carpenter, and his residence as No. 85 West Six-
</p>
<p>teenth Street. He belonged, like Mende, to the Carpenters' Union, which
</p>
<p>met at Zepf's Hall, and took an active part in all Anarchistic movements.
</p>
<p>He was at first exceedingly non-communicative to the police, and insisted,
</p>
<p>whenever he did speak, that he had no secrets to divulge. He was shown
</p>
<p>to the " cooler " down stairs, and the next day he was in a talkative mood.
</p>
<p>He willingly took all the officers into his confidence and talked unreserv-
</p>
<p>edly. He said :

<p>" I belong to the Carpenters' Union, and Louis Lingg belongs to the
</p>
<p>same organization. I have known Lingg for about eight months. We
</p>
<p>were good friends, and, after the meetin s of the union were over, Lingg
</p>
<p>and I often went home together. I got acquainted with him at those meet-
</p>
<p>:ings. . Lingg was a good worker for the carpenters, and they all like him for
</p>
<p>the interest he displayed in their behalf. I saw him at our union meeting
</p>
<p>on Monday evening about eight o'clock in Zepf's Hall. He made a speech
</p>
<p>there and called all of us to arms and to be ready. He said that the police
</p>
<p>were ready to club us and would only protect the capitalists and work only
</p>
<p>in the interests of the capitalists. ' You can see for yourselves,' Lingg said
</p>
<p>"LITTLE KRUEGER S" RECORD. 351
</p>
<p>' how the police acted at the McCormick factory ; they clubbed our people,
</p>
<p>they killed six of our brothers, and now we will fight them and take
</p>
<p>revenge.' He worked us all up, and every one was highly excited. He
</p>
<p>said that everything was ready and if we would only stick together we
</p>
<p>would win a certain victory. I saw at this meeting Hageman, Poch,
</p>
<p>Mende, Lehman, Louis Rentz and Kaiser. Rau and Niendorf were there
</p>
<p>and distributed the revenge circulars. That day Monday was a very
</p>
<p>exciting one among the Anarchists, and it would not have taken much to
</p>
<p>have started very serious trouble. Crowds of excited people were on Lake
</p>
<p>Street, from Union Street to the river, on that afternoon, and all were in
</p>
<p>bad temper. I attended the meeting on the afternoon of May 3d, at about
</p>
<p>three o'clock, at No. 71 West Lake Street, at Florus' Hall. I never was at
</p>
<p>any meeting held at No. 54 West Lake Street, at Greif's Hall, but I heard
</p>
<p>from others as to what had been done there. I saw Lingg again on the 5th
</p>
<p>of May, at Florus' Hall. I spoke to him, but he had very little to say.
</p>
<p>He looked downhearted. While I was there he disappeared, and I never
</p>
<p>saw him again."
</p>
<p>"Did you not give him money and clothes to get out of the city?" I
</p>
<p>asked.
</p>
<p>"Well, no one can prove that. If you think I did, you had better find
</p>
<p>your witness."
</p>
<p>"Do you mean to say that you did not help Lingg ? "
</p>
<p>Sisterer hung his head and would vouchsafe no answer.
</p>
<p>He was released, as I have already stated, but since this episode in his
</p>
<p>career, he has taken the lesson to heart and appears to be determined to
</p>
<p>keep away from uncanny places on moonless nights.
</p>
<p>AUGUST KRUEGER, alias "Little Krueger," was a different sort of a man
</p>
<p>from the rest of his chosen brotherhood. He was quite an intelligent
</p>
<p>fellow, well educated, with genteel manners, well chosen language and
</p>
<p>rather natty dress. He was a draftsman by occupation, and he was highly
</p>
<p>skilled. He was, with all his bloodthirsty professions, a very clever fellow,
</p>
<p>and became quite popular with his low-browed associates. He belonged to
</p>
<p>the Northwest Side company of the Lehr und Wehr Verein and took great
</p>
<p>interest in the drills. His ideas, however, were somewhat different from

<p>those of the other Anarchists. He did not believe in riots, but thought a
</p>
<p>revolution should be brought about by a general uprising of the people. In
</p>
<p>the old country, he had been a Socialist, but had been obliged to leave
</p>
<p>some seven years before the time of the Haymarket riot. Arriving here, he
</p>
<p>identified himself with the Anarchists, and, taking a deep interest in all
</p>
<p>movements directed against capitalists, he soon became highly esteemed
</p>
<p>by Spies and others. He was at the Haymarket meeting, having come in
</p>
<p>the company of Schnaubelt, the bomb-thrower, and claimed that he also
</p>
<p>left the meeting in his company. While not in perfect accord with his
</p>
<p>associates on isolated riots, and while he did not sanction such methods to
</p>
<p>hurt people, Krueger still entered into their plans and worked hard for their

<p>cause, and when Spies and others had been condemned to die he origin-
</p>
<p>ated a plot to release them from the jail, which, however, failing to secure
</p>
<p>members enough to carry it out, he finally abandoned.
</p>
<p>After the Haymarket riot, Krueger was continually watched by the
</p>
<p>detectives, and on the I3th of June he was arrested. He was found at the
</p>
<p>Terra Cotta Works, on Clybourn and Wrightwood Avenues, and brought
</p>
<p>to the Chicago Avenue Station. Here he showed that he had considerable
</p>
<p>grit. He was the kind of man who would risk his life for a good chance
</p>
<p>in a general revolution, and, although he characterized some of the Anar-
</p>
<p>chists as fools, he stubbornly refused to testify against them. He was kept
</p>
<p>for two hours under a
</p>
<p>steady fusillade of ques-
</p>
<p>tions by Assistant State's
</p>
<p>Attorney Furthmann, but
</p>
<p>he held out doggedly un-
</p>
<p>der the heavy fire. He
</p>
<p>could not be made to in-
</p>
<p>form. He was subse-
</p>
<p>quently released by order
</p>
<p>of the State's Attorney.
</p>
<p>He was, when last heard
</p>
<p>of, still working for
</p>
<p>Messrs. Parkhurst & Co.,
</p>
<p>the proprietors of the
</p>
<p>works, and appears to be
</p>
<p>well liked by them. In
</p>
<p>spite of his warning, he
</p>
<p>still adheres to his old
</p>
<p>ideas.
</p>
<p>His answers to the
</p>
<p>questions asked him were
</p>
<p>.as follows :
</p>
<p>" I am twenty-one years of age. I came from Germany seven years ago.

<p>I reside at No. 72 Kenion Street, near Paulina. I was a member of the Lehr
</p>
<p>und Wehr Verein a year and a half. I know Breitenfeld. He is the com-
</p>
<p>mander of the second company of the Lehr und Wehr Verein. I am orderly
</p>
<p>sergeant and secretary of that company. Schrade was captain. I heard
</p>
<p>of the letter ' Y ' about the first of April. We had a different signal. It
</p>
<p>was '? ? ?. ' This signal invited the armed organizations. I cannot say who
</p>
<p>originated the signal. The signal was then changed to 'Y.' We always
</p>
<p>met up-stairs under this signal ' Y,' except the last two meetings. I saw
</p>
<p>that letter last on Sunday preceding the riot. I went to that meeting at No.
</p>
<p>54 West Lake Street (May 3) alone. I got to the meeting about 8:30 o'clock.
</p>
<p>I went into the saloon and then went down stairs. There were then only a
</p>
<p>few people present. Seeing that the meeting had not started, I went up

</p>
<p>my card, but I had it with me. It was a red card No. 8. That is my
</p>
<p>number. We all go by numbers. I went down stairs again for a second
</p>
<p>time about a quarter to nine o'clock."
</p>
<p>A picture being shown him of Schnaubelt, he said :
</p>
<p>" I might have seen him. On Tuesday night, May 4, I was at Engel's
</p>
<p>house from nine o'clock to eleven o'clock. At the meeting I know that
</p>
<p>Fischer volunteered to have circulars printed for the Haymarket meeting.
</p>
<p>I am in favor of a complete revolution that is, when a majority of the
</p>
<p>people are in favor of it. I am an Anarchist, and will remain one as Jong as
</p>
<p>I live. My father was one, and he was warden of a penitentiary in the old
</p>
<p>country. I had to leave there because I was an Anarchist. I am opposed
</p>
<p>to all single attacks, like that at the Haymarket. I am in favor, also, of
</p>
<p>peaceable agitation. I could say more about others, but they are in trouble
</p>
<p>enough now. I don't want to be put down as a ' squealer.' I hope you will
</p>
<p>not insist on my becoming one, as I will not."
</p>
<p>EMIL NIENDORF, a German, was arrested on the i4th of June, by Officers
</p>
<p>Schuettler and Stift, and brought to the station. He had scarcely entered
</p>
<p>the place when he demanded to see me at once. On being brought into the
</p>
<p>office, he was asked what he wanted to say.
</p>
<p>"Well," opened up Niendorf, "I don't want to be locked up here six
</p>
<p>weeks. Neither do I want you folks to believe that I am a stubborn man.
</p>
<p>I want to talk. I want to tell you who I am, what I have done, and I don't
</p>
<p>want to be looked upon as a murderer. I am an eight-hour man. I want
</p>
<p>to get eight hours in a peaceable way. I do not want to kill people. I have
</p>
<p>no use for those rattle-heads."
</p>
<p>Niendorf was informed that all the officers connected with the station
</p>
<p>were too busy to attend to his case then, and that he would have to remain
</p>
<p>until the next day, when he would have an opportunity to tell all his troubles.
</p>
<p>He was locked up, but during the night, it appears, some prisoner or some
</p>
<p>one from the outside "put a flea in his ear," telling him not to open his
</p>
<p>mouth, to be a brave man, and he would come out all right. The next morn-
</p>
<p>ing at ten o'clock he was brought into my office, but he was not at all com-
</p>
<p>municative. He sat down and said nothing.

<p>"Well, Niendorf, how do you feel?" asked Mr. Furthmann. "How did
</p>
<p>you sleep ? "
</p>
<p>Not an answer.
</p>
<p>" Are you sick? " interestedly inquired Furthmann.
</p>
<p>No answer.
</p>
<p>" Did any one insult you or hurt you ? " continued Furthmann.
</p>
<p>Still no response.
</p>
<p>" Who has changed your mind since you were here ? " I inquired.
</p>
<p>Not a syllable of reply.
</p>
<p>"See here," said I, " you cannot make us feel bad. I will give you just
</p>
<p>two minutes by the watch to get over your lockjaw."
</p>
<p>354 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>This aroused Niendorf, and, looking around at all the officers present, he
</p>
<p>said :
</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, I have been warned not to speak. I did not see the party,,
</p>
<p>but some one called out my name and asked if I had been to the office yet.
</p>
<p>I answered no. The voice then said : ' When you go there, don't open
</p>
<p>your mouth, be motionless, and they will soon fire you out. Don't for-
</p>
<p>get.' "
</p>
<p>" That is just what I expected," I remarked. "Now you can do as you
</p>
<p>please talk or not talk. That party is not a friend of yours, and he wants
</p>
<p>to see you go to jail. Officer, take him down stairs."
</p>
<p>"Are you not going to let me speak? " nervously inquired, the prisoner.
</p>
<p>" How long will it take you to find your speech ? " exclaimed Furthmann.
</p>
<p>" Have I got to swear to what I tell you ? "
</p>
<p>" Yes ; you will have to do that whenever we send for you, and you must
</p>
<p>not leave the city without permission," said I.
</p>
<p>Niendorf then gave a statement of his knowledge of Anarchy. He
</p>
<p>appeared very ignorant, but, when spoken to, he showed that he was quite
</p>
<p>intelligent. He was twenty-six years of age, lived at No. 29 Croker Street,
</p>
<p>and, with fiery red hair, was a rather homely-looking man.
</p>
<p>He was released, and after his departure the officers determined to
</p>
<p>ascertain whether it was an "Anarchist ghost " or a man in flesh and bones
</p>
<p>that had hovered about the station warning Niendorf not to squeal. A
</p>
<p>close watch was accordingly put in the cell department to fathom the mys-
</p>
<p>tery. About ten o'clock that night a young fellow called at the station for
</p>
<p>a night's lodging. He was told to sit down and wait. He did so, and his
</p>
<p>wish was reported to me. Officer Loewenstein was sent back to look him
</p>
<p>over, and that officer presently returned and reported that the man did not
</p>
<p>look like a tramp. He looked more like an Israelite who had means, and
</p>
<p>the fellow was at once called into the office. There the officers unbuttoned
</p>
<p>his coat and discovered a clean young fellow, with a nice suit of clothes and
</p>
<p>a gold watch and chain.
</p>
<p>" What is your name ?" I asked sternly. "And don't forget to give it
</p>
<p>right."
</p>
<p>"Oh, please, I I did not mean anything bad."

</p>
<p>"Are you not baptized ; have you no name ? Officer, look him up until
</p>
<p>I find a name for him."
</p>
<p>" Let me go, and I will never come here again."
</p>
<p>"Who sent you here ? " I demanded.
</p>
<p>" I cannot tell do let me go. I will never, I promise you, come back
</p>
<p>again."
</p>
<p>" I don't think you will. When you leave here you will go through the
</p>
<p>'sewer.' '
</p>
<p>With exclamations of great grief and remorse, he looked appealingly to
</p>
<p>A MYSTERY MADE CLEAR. 355
</p>
<p>all the officers in the room, and, recognizing Officer Loewenstein as one of
</p>
<p>his race, he fell on his knees and begged the officer not to have him put
</p>
<p>through the "sewer."
</p>
<p>"Were you not here last night ? " asked the Captain.
</p>
<p>" No, sir; it was another fellow."
</p>
<p>The turnkey of the station was sent for and confirmed the stranger's
</p>
<p>denial. The now thoroughly frightened young man was then asked as to
</p>
<p>who the lodger of the night before was, but all he knew was that he himself
</p>
<p>had been hired by an unknown man that evening for one dollar to come and
</p>
<p>seek lodgings at the station to warn Anarchists. When the stranger had
</p>
<p>measurably recovered from his trepidation, he gave his name as Moses
</p>
<p>Wulf, and, his information being of no value, he was released with a severe
</p>
<p>lecture.
</p>
<p>Niendorf's statement ran as follows :
</p>
<p>" I was at a meeting held May 3 at 8 P.M., at No. 122 West Lake Street.
</p>
<p>I was chairman. I heard some one state that the police had killed a dozen
</p>
<p>workingmen at McCormick's factory. That created a great deal of excite-
</p>
<p>ment for some time at the meeting. Then some one shouted: 'Better be
</p>
<p>quiet and let us attend to our own affairs.' We were only looking after the
</p>
<p>eight-hour movement. I saw the revenge circular at that meeting, which
</p>
<p>called the people to arms. Louis Lingg was present to report some meet-
</p>
<p>ing and some business transactions as a committeeman. William Seliger
</p>
<p>was there as recording secretary of the meeting. Rau was there, and some
</p>
<p>one said to me that he had brought the circular. A man named Soenek
</p>
<p>made a speech and advised us to use force. It was decided, on motion, that
</p>
<p>we should act in sympathy with the people at McCormick's factory. I have
</p>
<p>been a member of the North Side group for about a year. I was at a
</p>
<p>meeting at Zepf's Hall May 3, which lasted till eleven o'clock P.M. About
</p>
<p>nine o'clock a man at the back door called out that all the men who
</p>
<p>belonged to the armed sections should go to 54 West Lake Street in the
</p>
<p>basement, where a meeting was to be held, and I saw a lot of members get
</p>
<p>up and leave the hall. I know Lingg belonged to the armed section. At
</p>
<p>one time he offered me some of his dynamite bombs. I told him I did not
</p>
<p>want any of them. He told me on another occasion that I had better take

</p>
<p>some and try some of his stuff. I told him that I was afraid to handle his
</p>
<p>stuff and I did not want it. Our meeting May 3 at Zepf's Hall was known
</p>
<p>as that of the Central Labor Union. A little fellow named Lutz was finan-
</p>
<p>cial secretary at that meeting. Rau was there only ten minutes. At a
</p>
<p>meeting held some time ago in Lake View, I was chairman. Lingg was one
</p>
<p>of the speakers, and also a man named Poch. Seliger called the meeting to
</p>
<p>order. I know Gruenwald; he is thirty-five years old, a carpenter by trade,
</p>
<p>five feet eight or nine inches tall, and has red whiskers. I heard Lingg say
</p>
<p>at several meetings that if any members wanted any of his 'chocolate,'
</p>
<p>meaning dynamite or dynamite bombs, he would supply them."
</p>
<p>JOHANNES GRUENEBERG, a German, had the distinction conferred on him
</p>
<p>of being one of the last of the more conspicuous Anarchists to be arrested.
</p>
<p>He had been known to the police for some time, in a general way, and
</p>
<p>356 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>inquiries about him brought out the fact that he was a prominent figure in
</p>
<p>Anarchistic circles. He knew where all the leaders lived, frequently visited
</p>
<p>them, and tramped around so often that he became quite a well-known
</p>
<p>character. Even the dogs that infested the localities through which he
</p>
<p>passed wagged their tails in cheerful recognition, and Grueneberg always
</p>
<p>had a kind word for both the brutes and his Anarchist friends. He was
</p>
<p>forty-five years of age, a married man with a family, and lived at No. 750
</p>
<p>West Superior Street. He was a carpenter by trade. On the ijth of
</p>
<p>June he was working on a new building at No. 340 Dearborn Avenue, and,
</p>
<p>while right in the midst of an exhortation to the other workingmen on the
</p>
<p>beauties of Anarchy, he was interrupted by Officers Hoffman and Schuet-
</p>
<p>tler, who notified him that he was under arrest.
</p>
<p>"That is just what I have been waiting for," he exclaimed, not in the
</p>
<p>least disconcerted. "Is it that d d Schaack that wants to see me? I
</p>
<p>will tell that fellow who I am. I will surprise him. "
</p>
<p>"Johannes," said Schuettler, "you can save yourself all of that trouble.
</p>
<p>Schaack knows all about you. I saw your name in the book. "
</p>
<p>"Come on quick," said Johannes, "I will show you a gamy man.
</p>
<p>Whenever I leave home I always bid my wife good-by, because I have
</p>
<p>expected to be arrested at any time, and did not know when I would see
</p>
<p>her again, for I will not squeal. I knew of these squealers, and I told my
</p>
<p>wife I would kill myself first before I would squeal."
</p>
<p>Officers and prisoner started for the station. Johannes opened up on a
</p>
<p>half run, and the officers could hardly keep up with him, so anxious did he
</p>
<p>appear. He entered the office with hair disordered and on end, and his
</p>
<p>eyes bulged out with excitement as he hurriedly surveyed some six officers
</p>
<p>who were in the office at the time.
</p>
<p>"Which one of you fellows," he wildly asked, "is Schaack? Show him
</p>
<p>to me quick."
</p>
<p>"Grueneberg," said I, for I recognized him at once from the descrip-
</p>
<p>tions I had had of the man, "what is the matter?"
</p>
<p>" Are you Schaack ? "
</p>
<p>"Yes, I am Schaack."
</p>
<p>" You sent for me to squeal, did you ? "

</p>
<p>He instantly pulled out a big jack-knife, and, handing it out towards
</p>
<p>me, he continued :
</p>
<p>"Take this and cut my head off."
</p>
<p>He twice repeated the request, and, still holding out his extended hand,
</p>
<p>said :
</p>
<p>' ' I will never squeal ; you can kill me first."
</p>
<p>"I heard that you were crazy," said I, "but I never thought you were
</p>
<p>quite so bad as this. You must suffer terribly. The weather is too warm
</p>
<p>A PECULIAR CHARACTER. 357
</p>
<p>for you. ' I think you had better go down stairs and have a glass of ice
</p>
<p>water."
</p>
<p>"No," yehemently responded Johannes, "we had better settle this
</p>
<p>matter right now. I want to go out a free man, or else you will have to
</p>
<p>carry me out of here a dead man. I would thank you, however, for a glass
</p>
<p>of water, but don't put me down stairs. I have heard too much of that
</p>
<p>place already."
</p>
<p>"Oh," said I, "it is not a bad place. Just go down and see for your-
</p>
<p>self. You will like the place ; it is nice and cool."
</p>
<p>"Please, Captain, let me sit in the next room," said Johannes, cooling
</p>
<p>down considerably, and modulating his voice to a gentler key; "I will
</p>
<p>behave myself."
</p>
<p>His austerity of manner had completely vanished, and his ferocious
</p>
<p>mien and language had gradually disappeared. He saw in me a different
</p>
<p>man from what he had expected, and the courteous treatment accorded him
</p>
<p>had melted his heart and vanquished his anger. I granted his request and
</p>
<p>told an officer to sit with him in an adjoining room.
</p>
<p>The moment the officer and prisoner were in the room, Johannes
</p>
<p>remarked :
</p>
<p>"Schaack is not a bad fellow. Is he not going to stop arresting
</p>
<p>people?"
</p>
<p>"Oh, no," said the officer, "he has a long list yet."
</p>
<p>"Are you with him all the time?"
</p>
<p>"I am."
</p>
<p>" Do you hear and see all ? "
</p>
<p>"I do."
</p>
<p>"Do the fellows all squeal? "
</p>
<p>"Yes, every one of them. If they don't squeal right away, they squeal
</p>
<p>the first chance they get."
</p>
<p>" I am too much of a man, and it would be very small in me to do so."
</p>
<p>" There have been as brave men as you in this office, and every one has
</p>
<p>squealed."
</p>
<p>"Well, when a man has a family, that cuts a big figure," said Johannes,
</p>
<p>hesitatingly.

<p>" If you are going to talk to Captain Schaack," said the officer, reading
</p>
<p>the man's mind, " you must understand that he does not want any fooling.
</p>
<p>You either tell him all or nothing, because some one has already told on
</p>
<p>you."
</p>
<p>This settled the matter with Grueneberg. He wanted to see me, and he
</p>
<p>was brought back into the office.
</p>
<p>" I was a little excited," began Johannes, apologetically.
</p>
<p>" All right," I assuringly replied ; " sit down and tell on yourself first. I
</p>
<p>am going to give you a trial."
</p>
<p>358 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>Grueneberg then went on to say :
</p>
<p>"Well, I am an Anarchist. I always worked hard for the working people.
</p>
<p>I am proud of it. I did good as long as I could, but now it is all up. I am
</p>
<p>a member of the Northwest Side group and always attended our meetings.
</p>
<p>I never missed one.
</p>
<p>"On Monday night, May 3, I attended a meeting at Zepf's Hall. I
</p>
<p>remained there until about 9:15 o'clock. From there I went to Greif's
</p>
<p>Hall. This was a secret meeting of the armed men. While the meeting
</p>
<p>continued all the doors were kept locked, and guards stood on the outside
</p>
<p>of each door, and also on the inside, and extra guards on the sidewalk. If
</p>
<p>any one stopped on the sidewalk, he would be told to move on. I heard
</p>
<p>Engel speak of his plan ; that it was a good one. If only every one would
</p>
<p>do his work, then the matter would be a very easy one of accomplishment.
</p>
<p>He stated that the plan had been made up last Sunday at 63 Emma Street,
</p>
<p>and had already been adopted by the Lehr und Wehr Verein and the
</p>
<p>groups. All who had heard of the plan, he said, were very much in favor
</p>
<p>of it, and all understood by this time how to act. ' We are,' he continued,
</p>
<p>'going to do this right, because all the boys look to us as the leaders, and we
</p>
<p>are going to call a meeting for to-morrow night at the Haymarket. Since
</p>
<p>all the people are excited, we will have a large crowd, and we will have things
</p>
<p>so shaped that the police will interfere. Then will be the chance to give it
</p>
<p>to them ? I could notice by the acts of all present at this meeting that
</p>
<p>there was a great deal of bad blood among them against the police on
</p>
<p>account of the killing of so many people at McCormick's. "
</p>
<p>"Do you now believe that a single person was killed at McCormick's? "
</p>
<p>" Of course I do. You killed six men."
</p>
<p>" Not one was killed," said I, "and you ought to know that by this time."
</p>
<p>"All I' know," said Johannes, "is what August Spies said. I was a
</p>
<p>carrier of the Anarchist, Engel's paper. My route was on Madison Street,
</p>
<p>and on the Southwest Side," he continued, dropping the 54 West Lake
</p>
<p>Street meeting.
</p>
<p>"And what did you think of that paper?" I inquired.
</p>
<p>"That was the best paper we ever had."
</p>
<p>"It was too bad," added I, "that the sweet little paper died so young.

</p>
<p>Where was it printed ? "
</p>
<p>" I don't know, because the papers were sent to my house by the South-
</p>
<p>west Side group."
</p>
<p>" Who else carried that paper ? "
</p>
<p>" Messerschmidt, Schneider, Schoenfeld, Geimer and Kirbach. We
</p>
<p>each carried about fifty papers at a time."
</p>
<p>"Do you know anything more about the secret meeting at No. 54 West
</p>
<p>Lake Street, May 3d ? "
</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know all. I went out twice."
</p>
<p>"And how did you get in every time ? "
</p>
<p>" I had a card, and I had to show that every time. That is all, and,
</p>
<p>besides, the boys all knew me."
</p>
<p>THE "DEAR OLD FLAG." 359
</p>
<p>" What do you know about Louis Lingg ? "
</p>
<p>" He is a good man. I like him. He speaks to the point."
</p>
<p>"On dynamite," I suggested.
</p>
<p>" Yes, and on other things."
</p>
<p>" He only likes Anarchists," I interrupted.
</p>
<p>"Yes, that is so."
</p>
<p>"What do you know about the Arbeiter-Zeitung ?"
</p>
<p>"Well, it is a very good paper, but it is too mild."
</p>
<p>"Do you mean to tell me that a paper which advises people to murder
</p>
<p>and kill is too mild ? " I asked.
</p>
<p>"They don't put force enough into it. They don't keep up things as
</p>
<p>they ought to. I know all who visit there. I am a friend of all the Spieses."
</p>
<p>After being "roasted" for three hours, Johannes was permitted to go
</p>
<p>back to his work, and he left under the impression that, after all, he had
</p>
<p>not said anything criminally implicating any of his comrades. He was not
</p>
<p>asked to report when wanted, as he was too noisy a fellow to have around
</p>
<p>the station, and the officers were as well pleased to see him go as they had
</p>
<p>been pleased to arrest him. He inaugurated no reform on his release. On the
</p>
<p>contrary, he was again as rabid as ever and ran around night and day trying
</p>
<p>to gather a mob to go to the jail and liberate the Anarchists. He made no
</p>
<p>secret of his work. He loved the red flag, he said, and he would die for it
</p>
<p>if necessary. One night he came to me in company with two other fellows
</p>
<p>and demanded the return of a large red flag which at one time belonged to
</p>
<p>International Carpenters' Union No. i. This flag had been taken by the
</p>
<p>police with many others some time before. Grueneberg said that he had
</p>
<p>marched behind it many times and he was proud of it. He wanted to see
</p>
<p>the "dear old flag" once more and secure possession of it. I had the flag
</p>
<p>at the station, but, knowing that Anarchists had an "undying love" for
</p>
<p>Inspector Bonfield, I remarked :
</p>
<p>" If you want the flag, all you have to do is to see the Inspector, and I
</p>
<p>am quite sure he will give it to you."
</p>
<p>An expression of intense disgust came over the faces of the three Anar-
</p>
<p>chists, and Grueneberg excitedly exclaimed :
</p>
<p>"Bonfield! Bonfield! Ah, the d d black Bonfield! I see him?

</p>
<p>Oh, no ! he is not gentleman enough for me to see."
</p>
<p>"Bonfield is a very clever fellow," said I ; "he likes such men as you."
</p>
<p>"Oh, yes; he would like my head in a bag. Good night, Mr. Schaack;
</p>
<p>I don't want the flag."
</p>
<p>Grueneberg belonged at this time to Carpenters' Union No. 241, and, on
</p>
<p>account of his peculiar and ridiculous actions, the members gradually grew
</p>
<p>suspicious of him and finally believed that he was a paid spy in the employ
</p>
<p>of some detective agency. They harbored their mistrust for a time, and
</p>
<p>then accused him of being a traitor. He demanded that charges be pre-
</p>
<p>360 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>ferred against him, and it was done. Grueneberg failing to answer these
</p>
<p>charges, he was expelled from the union. A few weeks thereafter he
</p>
<p>reformed, and one day, meeting me, he said :
</p>
<p>" I am done with these people. They are all cranks. No person can do
</p>
<p>enough for them. I worked with them night and day. They put me on
</p>
<p>all" the committees. I had to do all the running, and for all my trouble and
</p>
<p>as a reward they call me a spy. I am working steady now and they can all go
</p>
<p>to the d 1. I am only sorry for my poor children the way they suffered
</p>
<p>while I was giving my time to Anarchy. I have now worked four weeks
</p>
<p>and made full time. This I have not done before for the last two years."
</p>
<p>About two months after the above incident, Grueneberg and his family
</p>
<p>passed the Desplaines Street Station. Meeting me, Grueneberg spoke up,
</p>
<p>saying :
</p>
<p>"Well, Captain, what do you think of my family now?"
</p>
<p>" I must give you a great deal of credit," said I pleasantly. " You are
</p>
<p>all looking remarkably well. A man that has gone as far as you in Anar-
</p>
<p>chy deserves credit for such a great change, and if all the rest were kicked
</p>
<p>out of their unions, I think it would be a blessing to their poor wives and
</p>
<p>children."
</p>
<p>After bidding me good-by, Grueneberg and his family walked away
</p>
<p>proud and happy in their new condition, and I went to my office and drew
</p>
<p>this moral from the example of reform I had just seen : Here was a man
</p>
<p>who had belonged to the Anarchists for three or four years, and had been at

<p>OTTO BAUM was one of the desperate Anarchists who made the air blue

<p>with imprecations against capital. He would have been gathered in with the

<p>others had it not been for his special care to keep out of the reach of the
</p>
<p>police. He lived at No. 137 Cleveland Avenue, was married and had three
</p>
<p>children, and, when he worked, which he rarely did, it was at the carpenter's

<p>trade. He was a strong, robust man, nearly six feet high, and with black
</p>
<p>hair, full, black beard, and piercing black eyes, he presented a rather vicious
</p>
<p>appearance. When he first came to Chicago, some four years preceding
</p>
<p>the Haymarket meeting, he joined the Socialists, and he soon became a full-
</p>
<p>fledged Anarchist. He belonged to the notorious International Carpenters'
</p>
<p>Union No. i. This union had then a thousand members, and Baum's number
</p>
<p>was 100. About two years ago the union changed its number to 241, and a
</p>
<p>worse set of Anarchists could not be found in the United States than the
</p>
<p>members of this organization just before the 4th of May, 1886. They were
</p>
<p>A WIFE-BEATING REVOLUTIONIST. 361
</p>
<p>provided with all kinds of arms revolvers, daggers, rifles, dynamite and
</p>
<p>fire-cans. Lingg was one of the leading spirits in this revolutionary gang.
</p>
<p>After the Haymarket explosion, when the police took up a hot pursuit of
</p>
<p>the conspirators, Baum changed his residence with his family and carefully
</p>
<p>kept off the streets during the daytime. On the conclusion of the trial of
</p>
<p>the leading conspirators, he became emboldened over the immunity he had
</p>
<p>enjoyed from arrest, and crawled out of his hole, like a coon does in the
</p>
<p>spring-time.
</p>
<p>So great was Baunrs interest in Anarchy that he wholly neglected his
</p>
<p>family. He never troubled himself about wife or children, but hung around
</p>
<p>saloons guzzling beer and breathing vengeance against the police and society.
</p>
<p>He went lower and lower from day to day, and frequently reeled home in a
</p>
<p>drunken stupor, only to abuse his family. About a year and a half ago,
</p>
<p>when his last child was born, his neglect had left not a mouthful in the
</p>
<p>house, and, had it not been for the kindly assistance of friends and neigh-
</p>
<p>bors, the family would have been in a most deplorable condition. When
</p>
<p>the child was a week old, the wife, poor and sickly as she was, had to leave
</p>
<p>the house and seek work to supply the family with the necessaries of life.
</p>
<p>With food thus obtained, almost at the sacrifice of the poor woman's life, the
</p>
<p>burly brute of a husband was always first at the table, and eagerly devoured
</p>
<p>what she had provided. Did he seek to obtain employment ? Not at
</p>
<p>all. He preferred loafing and talking about Anarchy. The poor wife's
</p>
<p>uncomplaining toil he rewarded with abuse and cruelty, calling her the vilest
</p>
<p>of names, and even kicking her about as if she were made of rubber. She
</p>
<p>was a delicate, sickly woman, but she bore his fiendish treatment, hoping
</p>
<p>that a change would come over him after the law had made an example of
</p>
<p>other Anarchists. But the change did not come, and finally she determined
</p>
<p>to seek the protection of the courts. Accordingly she went to the Chicago
</p>
<p>Avenue Police Court on the 6th of February, 1888, with her infant in her
</p>
<p>arms, and swore out a warrant against her husband.
</p>
<p>The lazy giant was at once arrested, and on the next morning the poor
</p>
<p>woman appeared to testify against him. Being unable to speak English, an
</p>
<p>interpreter was called, and during the recital of her grievances and the many
</p>
<p>indignities imposed upon her by her liege lord, the court-room was as quiet

<p>Imost as a death-chamber. All eagerly listened to her troubles, and, her
</p>
<p>statements being given in such a simple, convincing manner, many eyes were
</p>
<p>loist with tears. Justice Kersten, who presides over this court, has no
</p>
<p>regard for wife-beaters, and he promptly fined Baum $50.
</p>
<p>"That," said he, in an emphatic manner, "will keep you locked up for
</p>
<p>one hundred and three days."
</p>
<p>The brute was then locked up where so many of his former associates
</p>
<p>had been incarcerated two years previously, and in the afternoon he was
</p>
<p>sent to the House of Correction by Bailiff Scanlan.

</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>During this episode it came out that Baum had been quite active in
</p>
<p>Anarchist circles, and at the time the Anarchists were confined in the
</p>
<p>County Jail he was engaged in an attempt to gather a mob to effect their
</p>
<p>liberation. One night he went about saying that he was determined to kill
</p>
<p>somebody before the next morning. The more he talked, the more frenzied
</p>
<p>he became, and with his frenzy grew his thirst for liquor, the need of
</p>
<p>which he felt to get up his courage to the required pitch. A few hours
</p>
<p>afterwards he was found in the yard fronting his house, asleep and "dead
</p>
<p>drunk." The only courage he ever displayed was in lording it over his
</p>
<p>THE WIFE-BEATER'S TRIAL.
</p>
<p>wife and beating her almost to death. He was a type of a very
</p>
<p>large class of Anarchists. He would call the better class of people
</p>
<p>tyrants, because they did not fill his pockets with plenty of money so that
</p>
<p>he could get drunk as often as he desired, but in his own household he was
</p>
<p>the meanest of tyrants.
</p>
<p>Had Mrs. Baum been a little shrewder, she would not have had to
</p>
<p>endure his brutalities as long as she did. There are many other wives of
</p>
<p>Anarchists who are ill-treated by their husbands, but some of these
</p>
<p>managed to bring their lords to their senses by a neat ruse. While the

</p>
<p>would almost crawl into a sewer to get out of the way of the police, and,
</p>
<p>noticing the timely fright that overcame the "reds" whenever an officer or
</p>
<p>detective appeared in their midst, many shrewd wives quieted wrathful
</p>
<p>husbands by threatening to go out and see me. This ruse, I learn, was often
</p>
<p>resorted to to avert a beating from a drunken Anarchist.
</p>
<p>GUSTAV POCH was a conspicuous figure in Anarchist plots, and never
</p>
<p>tired of working for the cause. But Anarchists are an anxious, jealous and
</p>
<p>thankless lot of people, and because Gustav was achieving a little more
</p>
<p>prominence than some of his immediate associates, they found fault with
</p>
<p>him and sought to degrade him. They might have secretly given him
</p>
<p>away to the police, and thus got him out of the way of their own advance-
</p>
<p>ment, but a fear for their own safety prevented such a course, and so they
</p>
<p>began calling him hard names. But I shall let Gustav state his own griev-
</p>
<p>ance. Here is a letter he wrote to his union :
</p>
<p>CHICAGO, September 10, 1884.
</p>
<p>At a meeting held on the 3rd of September, instant, of Branch No. 2, of Union No. 21,
</p>
<p>Carpenters and Joiners, the Secretary read a letter in which I, the undersigned, was insulted
</p>
<p>in a shameful manner. In this letter they called me a swindler simply for the purpose of
</p>
<p>breaking up the Union, and at the end of the letter they stated that I would be expelled from
</p>
<p>the Union on account of it. The letter was signed by Fr. Ebert and Dom. All these insults
</p>
<p>and injuries to my reputation I can't let pass. My honor, my reputation and my future pros-
</p>
<p>perity are damaged and at stake. I would, therefore, move that an investigation be made
</p>
<p>into the matter and that the instigators of the complaint be punished. What was their
</p>
<p>motive ? For the last few weeks complaints have been made against me by the Secretary to
</p>
<p>the effect that I, as Acting Secretary, had made false entries on the books. As he could not
</p>
<p>exonerate himself in the eyes of my brothers, he drew up the letter, which was published at
</p>
<p>the meeting of September 3rd, and which was signed by Fritz Ebert and Dom, to put me in
</p>
<p>a bad light before the Union. The evidence : Fritz Ebert told me in the presence of John
</p>
<p>Zwirlein that the main object out of which this accusation originated was the following : I
</p>
<p>was selected by President Blair on the 3rd of May to the Main Committee in place of
</p>
<p>Brother Eppinger, who could not serve on account of having too much other work while the
</p>
<p>strike lasted. After that I held this position nineteen days. I got paid for twelve days, and
</p>
<p>they withheld seven days from me and said I was discharged from the Main Committee. Is
</p>
<p>there anything to show that I was expelled ? Of course I put in my claim for $21 in writing,
</p>

</p>
<p>and no one ever told me what became of this claim. I was the only German-speaking repre-
</p>
<p>sentative on the Strike Committee, and I had to do more labor than any one else. Any one
</p>
<p>who participated in the strike during the last seven days can confirm this assertion. Now,
</p>
<p>how can Mr. Printer put up such a letter and show me up as a swindler ?
</p>
<p>In consequence of the insults inflicted on me, I besj for an investigation and for his
</p>
<p>punishment according to the rules and regulations of the Brotherhood.

</p>
<p>IN the numerous arrests and raids made, the police became thoroughly
</p>
<p>acquainted with the most notorious Anarchists in the city, the ins and
</p>
<p>outs of their resorts, and even the interior arrangement of their dwelling-
</p>
<p>places. Not only were suspects arrested, but search was made for contra-
</p>
<p>band articles. A varied collection of arms, bombs, etc., and a large assort-
</p>
<p>ment of red bunting thus found their way to the Chicago Avenue Station.
</p>
<p>In all the public demonstrations made by the Anarchists in the city they had
</p>
<p>carried many flags, banners and transparencies as emblems of defiance, and
</p>
<p>whenever such were found they were carefully taken in charge. When the in-
</p>
<p>vestigations were concluded, the inner room of my private office was well filled
</p>
<p>with a most curious display of these time-worn and weather-beaten ensigns,
</p>
<p>and the collection is very interesting as a reminder of a critical period in the
</p>
<p>history of Chicago. There are flags of a very primitive and cheap descrip-
</p>
<p>tion, and flags more or less elaborate and expensive. They varied in size
</p>
<p>and differed in the degree of their crimson colors. Those belonging to
</p>
<p>groups were large and plain, showing frequent handling by dirt-begrimed
</p>
<p>hands, and were mounted on plain pine staffs. Those carried by the Lehr
</p>
<p>und Wehr Verein were of finer texture and larger in size, its principal
</p>
<p>standard, of silk, being a present from the female revolutionists and gor-
</p>
<p>geous in the amplitude of its folds. This silken standard was the pride and
</p>
<p>joy of the whole fraternity, and at one time it served to relieve the motley
</p>
<p>collection with its bright vermilion, but in some unaccountable manner it
</p>
<p>disappeared one day from a West Side police station. The reds had evi-

</p>

</p>
<p>366 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>may know something of the mysterious disappearance of the Anarchists'
</p>
<p>chief standard.
</p>
<p>During the searches by the department for other suspicious and inflam-
</p>
<p>matory articles, several fire-cans were found in the northwest part of the
</p>
<p>city, on the 3d of June, by Officer Whalen. In exterior appearance these
</p>
<p>looked very harmless, but an examination of their contents showed them
</p>
<p>capable of doing a great deal'of mischief. They each had a capacity of a
</p>
<p>quart, and were made of medium heavy tin, with a round hole in the center
</p>
<p>of the top, about an inch in diameter. This opening was provided with a
</p>
<p>threaded neck of tin about an inch high, with a cover to fit. Underneath
</p>
<p>the cover was a sort of clasp, into which fitted the neck of a small vial,
</p>
<p>and through the cover a small hole was bored, for the admission of a fuse
</p>
<p>into the vial. When ready for use the can would be filled with an explosive
</p>
<p>or with coal-oil, and the flask would contain powder. All that then remained
</p>
<p>would be to light the fuse, throw the can either into a lumber-yard or under
</p>
<p>the stairway of some residence or business block, and no one would know
</p>
<p>the perpetrator of a possibly disastrous fire. The cans found by Officer
</p>
<p>Whalen were loaded and had evidently been intended for use on the night
</p>
<p>of May 4. Fortunately the owner must have become frightened and hid
</p>
<p>them to escape arrest.
</p>
<p>The suggestion for the manufacture of these cans came from across the
</p>
<p>water. A short time preceding May 4, at a meeting held in Thalia Hall, a
</p>
<p>few Frenchmen and several Germans, who had passed through the reign of
</p>
<p>the Commune in Paris in 1871, gave a general idea of the important part
</p>
<p>such cans had played in that city and added that women at that time did
</p>
<p>as good work with them as the men. Such fire-cans, together with glass
</p>
<p>balls filled with nitro-glycerine, were carried in baskets, and if the reds
</p>
<p>wanted to destroy a building they would throw a can through the window, or
</p>
<p>if they desired to annihilate a guard of soldiers they would hurl into their
</p>
<p>midst one of the glass balls, which would explode by concussion and tear
</p>
<p>the men to pieces.
</p>
<p>These missiles had created great havoc in Paris, and the members of
</p>
<p>the Thalia Hall gathering were urged to adopt them for use in Chicago.
</p>
<p>At that time there were enough desperate Anarchists in the city to have
</p>

</p>
<p>used all that could have been manufactured, but some of the men at the
</p>
<p>meeting insisted that the women should be asked to assist in disposing of
</p>
<p>them to the destruction of the town. One big, loud-mouthed fellow, evi-
</p>
<p>dently a coward, shouted :
</p>
<p>"My wife will do that. She is an Anarchist as good as any one
</p>
<p>of us."
</p>
<p>No doubt she was an Anarchist, as the city had a great many of these
</p>
<p>poor, deluded creatures at the time, who were willing to do almost any-
</p>
<p>thing their husbands might ask, but many of whom have since had occasion
</p>
<p>EXPERIMENTING WITH FIRE-CANS. 367
</p>
<p>to feel the poverty into which they were finally forced by men who neglected
</p>
<p>work, family and all for the sake of talking revolution.
</p>
<p>Many of these men were just cowardly enough to thrust their wives for-
</p>
<p>ward where danger lurked, and while they themselves enjoyed the safety of
</p>
<p>a groggery, they would have been pleased, "for principle's sake," to see
</p>
<p>their poor helpmeets go around and set fire to houses and other property,
</p>
<p>so that the dauntless husbands could brag of the brave achievements of
</p>
<p>"the family."
</p>
<p>The meeting in question must have set the Anarchists to thinking ; and
</p>
<p>it is a matter of record that Parsons had fallen into the same idea when he
</p>
<p>addressed a secret meeting on the North Side, to which I shall subsequently
</p>
<p>refer. It is certain that many of these fire-cans were manufactured.
</p>
<p>Besides the petroleum-cans discovered by Officer Whalen, a lot of the
</p>
<p>same kind were taken out of the city by way of West Lake Street on May
</p>
<p>7, when the Anarchists were hurrying their ammunition out of town to pre-
</p>
<p>vent detection. According to the statements of some reformed reds, there
</p>
<p>are a great many of these cans and bombs still concealed in the Bohemian
</p>
<p>settlement in the southwest part of the city.
</p>
<p>On the 8th of June, 1886, I decided to have the cans tested, and for this
</p>
<p>purpose detailed Officers Rehm and Coughlin. The latter had at one time
</p>
<p>been a miner, and was therefore experienced in the use of explosives. The
</p>
<p>two officers took one of the cans to the lake shore. The can was placed on
</p>
<p>a plot of grass and the fuse lighted. In eight seconds an explosion fol-
</p>
<p>lowed. The grass burned within a circumference of five feet. The flame
</p>
<p>extended four feet in height and continued for about three minutes. The
</p>
<p>officers gave it as their opinion that any one of the cans was sufficient to
</p>
<p>set a building on fire.
</p>
<p>What a blessing it was for our citizens that this devilish invention did
</p>
<p>not spread its destructive work before May 4, 1886.
</p>
<p>As stated at the outset, the police were brought, in all these raids, into
</p>
<p>close acquaintanceship with the malcontents, and often came in close con-
</p>
<p>tact with their families. Some of the sights they saw were shocking in the
</p>
<p>extreme, and they had many opportunities to sound the depths of misery
</p>
<p>and want entailed upon families by husbands gone daft on Anarchy. The

<p>tales of woe and domestic infelicity poured into their ears would fill many
</p>
<p>pages, but the general tenor of all can be judged by what has been revealed
</p>
<p>in the statements given in the preceding chapters.
</p>
<p>Anarchy may look extremely inviting when depicted by a plausible
</p>
<p>speaker, but its practical side is strikingly brought out in the home life of
</p>
<p>its devotees. Any one visiting the homes of Anarchists, and carefully con-
</p>
<p>trasting the surroundings with those of true laboring men not affected by
</p>
<p>the taint of revolution, would give Anarchy a wide berth. But unfortun-
</p>

</p>
<p>capital and madly rush to ruin without thinking of consequences until it is
</p>
<p>too late. Read the reports made to me at the time, and they all tell the
</p>
<p>same story of want and degradation.
</p>
<p>There always has been and always will be a fascination about any
</p>
<p>scheme that promises ease without labor. So long as men can be found
</p>
<p>with impressionable minds that can be swayed by demagogues into a belief
</p>
<p>that Anarchy has in it the elements of comfort, splendor and luxury with
</p>
<p>very little toil, so long, no doubt, will dupes be found ready to sacrifice
</p>
<p>energy, thrift and independence for the life-degrading scarlet banner. But
</p>
<p>such ease can never be attained through blood in the United States. That
</p>
<p>fact has been established in Chicago, and the precedent ought to serve as
</p>
<p>a terrible warning to all malcontents. If
</p>
<p>the abject want of those who constitute
</p>
<p>the bulk of the revolutionists, whose
</p>
<p>very squalor has been the result of their
</p>
<p>zeal for Anarchy, is not sufficient to deter
</p>
<p>men from becoming Anarchists, the fate
</p>
<p>of the eight conspirators who were
</p>
<p>brought to trial in Chicago ought at least
</p>
<p>to prevent men from plotting murder,
</p>
<p>incendiarism and pillage.
</p>
<p>With the tremendous odds against
</p>
<p>them, it is surprising that men could be
</p>
<p>found willing to take up arms for the
</p>
<p>destruction of life and property, and
</p>
<p>the action of the reds in Chicago can be
</p>
<p>explained only on the theory that they
</p>
<p>felt they had only to strike one severe
</p>
<p>blow to bring thousands of secret sym-

<p>pathizers into line, and cause capitalists

<p>under the displeasure of the police. In their excited gatherings they had

<p>in the one frenzied, consuming desire to wreak vengeance upon those who

<p>had accumulated more wealth than themselves. They were bent on
</p>
<p>wresting away the wealth of others, and no mercy was to be shown to
</p>
<p>those who stood between them and that end.
</p>
<p>The police, as protectors of wealth in property and property in wealth,
</p>
<p>were the immediate objects of their enmity and wrath, and throughout the
</p>
<p>Anarchistic conspiracy, as has been shown by the disclosures made, we
</p>
<p>were to receive their first and special attention before the grand onslaught
</p>
<p>DYNAMITE vs. GATLING GUN. 369
</p>
<p>upon capitalists. Crazed by their speakers and dazed with the glittering
</p>
<p>prospect held out to them, the human fiends proposed to exterminate us
</p>
<p>with dynamite and then vanquish the rich and abolish all forms of property.
</p>
<p>Could anything be more absurd ? And yet that is what they sought to
</p>
<p>accomplish on the eventful night of May 4th.
</p>
<p>It would seem that the scheme to blow up the police stations could only
</p>
<p>originate in a lunatic asylum, but the confessions of those arrested show
</p>
<p>that men with apparently sound minds minds at least sane enough to
</p>
<p>keep them out of such institutions actually contemplated it and had
</p>
<p>made all the necessary arrangements to execute the plot. Strange must
</p>
<p>have been their conceptions of public sentiment when they believed that the
</p>
<p>execution of their bloody plan would result in the establishment of wider
</p>
<p>and freer social conditions, and strange, indeed, must have been their
</p>
<p>hallucinations when they thought that the devastation they proposed would
</p>
<p>be seconded and aided by the laboring men whom they counted upon as
</p>
<p>secret sympathizers ready to reveal their true feelings the moment the revo-
</p>
<p>lution was generally inaugurated.
</p>
<p>The danger of the scheme to themselves did not strike them until the
</p>
<p>last moment, when their courage was to be put to a practical test, but,
</p>
<p>fortunately for themselves, they went no further than the Haymarket riot.
</p>
<p>That they seriously contemplated more than they perpetrated is beyond
</p>
<p>dispute. They saw the intense excitement consequent on the eight-hour
</p>
<p>strike and the troubles at McCormick's factory, and knew that the police
</p>
<p>stations would be filled with officers in readiness for emergencies. They
</p>
<p>had called the Haymarket meeting for the express purpose of provoking
</p>
<p>hostilities, and they regarded it as an opportune time to strike a terrible
</p>
<p>blow against the police all over the city. Their calculations in that respect
</p>
<p>were eminently correct.
</p>
<p>The moment the reds began to incite a vicious mob to deeds of blood-
</p>
<p>shed, hostilities were provoked, and they got a dose of their own medicine.
</p>
<p>Had it not been for their precipitate flight they would have fared far worse.
</p>
<p>All the police stations were full of men, all the reserves having been called
</p>
<p>out for duty on the first sign of violent demonstrations, and these stood
</p>
<p>ready to make short work of all who might stand up against them in a con-

<p>flict. It was fortunate for the conspirators that they considered "discretion
</p>
<p>the better part of valor" at the Haymarket, and doubly fortunate that they
</p>
<p>received no signal to commence their bloody operations at the stations.
</p>
<p>The loss of life no doubt would have been appalling on both sides, but
</p>
<p>the outcome, as far as the triumph of law and order is concerned, would
</p>
<p>have been the same. The bomb would have done deadly work at the start,
</p>
<p>but the Gatling gun would have come to the rescue had the police been
</p>
<p>seriously crippled.
</p>
<p>Missiles of dynamite hurled into the stations on that eventful night of

<p>370 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>May 4 would indeed have created terrible havoc. In fact, the reds could
</p>
<p>not have chosen a time more favorable for their bloody plans. The East
</p>
<p>Chicago Avenue Station that night contained a very large force. I had in
</p>
<p>reserve and waiting orders one hundred and twenty-five officers. They
</p>
<p>were all over the building, up and down stairs, in the court-room, in the
</p>
<p>reception-room and in every other available place. Many were in the office,
</p>
<p>which is used as a roll-call room, and in which all details of officers are
</p>
<p>made. This office is in the center of the building and overlooks an alley on
</p>
<p>the east. The officers were organized into five companies, and all duly
</p>
<p>numbered. Any company could be called at any time, and in less than five
</p>
<p>minutes it would be in marching order.
</p>
<p>This precaution was taken in expectation of a call to the Haymarket,
</p>
<p>and the Anarchists, in the damnable conspiracies of that evening, had anti-
</p>
<p>cipated such preparations. They were accordingly on the ground. Fif-
</p>
<p>teen members of the North Side group, as appears plainly from the
</p>
<p>confessions of some of the Anarchists, loitered around the station, waiting
</p>
<p>for orders or signal, or to abide their own pleasure as soon as they could
</p>
<p>see for themselves that the riot had begun on the West Side. When
</p>
<p>that time arrived, they were to watch the windows of the roll-call room from
</p>
<p>the alley and throw their infernal machines into the midst of the officers the
</p>
<p>moment the room was full.
</p>
<p>The cut-throats skulked around the station like so many Indians around
</p>
<p>the cabin of a helpless settler, constantly dodging around in the darkness,
</p>
<p>fearful that they might be discovered. True to their instincts, however,
</p>
<p>these Chicago reds could not do without their beer while awake, and they
</p>
<p>made frequent trips to neighboring beer-saloons. About 9:30 o'clock Lieut.
</p>
<p>Baus and Lieut. Lloyd, each with a company of officers, returned from the
</p>
<p>Central Station, where I had sent them as a reserve during the Haymarket
</p>
<p>meeting, and when the Anarchists saw them in the roll-call room of my
</p>
<p>station, they sneaked around on the dark side of the alley and selected the
</p>
<p>third and fourth windows as those through which their deadly bombs should
</p>
<p>crash on their destructive mission. These windows are in the center of the
</p>
<p>large room. They had with them a number of bombs, both of the round
</p>
<p>lead and the long gas-pipe variety. While they stood underneath those

</p>
<p>windows, they got into a whispered quarrel about the kind of bomb that
</p>
<p>should be used.
</p>
<p>Bock had a round lead bomb, and he said :
</p>
<p>"I don't think this will go off. Let one of you throw a larger bomb."
</p>
<p>Then Abraham Hermann became angry and said :
</p>
<p>"You d d fool, what the d -1 are you here for, if your d d
</p>
<p>bombs are no good ? You are too much of a coward to throw them."
</p>
<p>Just at this point two officers left the station to visit a cigar-store, and
</p>
<p>stopped for a moment at the entrance of the alley to finish their conversation.
</p>
<p>COWARDS IN AMBUSH.
</p>
<p>The Anarchists saw them, and, thinking that they had been discovered,
</p>
<p>they hurriedly made their exit in an opposite direction, running to the rear
</p>
<p>of the building on its dark side and then emerging on Superior Street.
</p>
<p>Some of them went over to the West Side, to the Haymarket meeting, and
</p>
<p>others sought different saloons on Clark Street.
</p>
<p>After frequent libations, some met again on Superior Street in the
</p>
<p>vicinity of a wagon-manufacturing establishment, and, under the cover of
</p>
<p>numerous wagons standing on the street between Clark Street and La Salle
</p>
<p>Avenue, they decided that the men who then had
</p>
<p>bombs should proceed to the call-room windows,
</p>
<p>and the others, with revolvers, should take position
</p>
<p>in the alley diagonally across from the entrance of
</p>
<p>the station. Then,
</p>
<p>at the proper
</p>
<p>signal, the bombs
</p>
<p>were to be hurled
</p>
<p>in^p the room, and
</p>
<p>the men across
</p>
<p>the way were to
</p>
<p>fire a volley into
</p>
<p>such officers as
</p>
<p>might come out.
</p>
<p>While this plan
</p>
<p>was being form-
</p>
<p>ed, I received an
</p>
<p>order from In-
</p>
<p>spector Bonfield
</p>
<p>to send all my

<p>men to the West

</p>
<p>and the killing of
</p>
<p>officers, and in less than four minutes I had seventy-five men on the way to
</p>
<p>the Haymarket. The Anarchists were still standing among the wagons, and,
</p>
<p>to their great surprise and dismay, they saw three patrol wagons passing with:
</p>
<p>a tremendous speed. Their hearts at once fell into their boots, and they
</p>
<p>knew that the trouble had commenced. They repaired to Moody's church,
</p>
<p>and remained there a few moments deliberating what should be done. One
</p>
<p>of them tried to brace up the flagging spirits of his comrades by saying!
</p>
<p>that "now the time had arrived when something must be done, but thefyJ
</p>

</p>
<p>must never tell of their being there." Not one, however, seemed willing to-
</p>
<p>execute the plot they had agreed upon. On the contrary, they turned up
</p>
<p>La Salle Avenue and ran to Neff's Hall as fast as their legs could carry
</p>
<p>them. What occurred at that hall that night I have already shown in a
</p>
<p>preceding chapter.
</p>
<p>The plan to throw bombs into the roll-call room was afterwards unfolded
</p>
<p>to me by one of those in the plot, and, had it not been for the two officers
</p>
<p>accidentally stopping at the entrance of the alley, many of the boys of the
</p>
<p>Fifth Precinct would have been murdered even before the commencement
</p>
<p>of the riot at the Haymarket. The ruffians who hung around that station
</p>
<p>were Abraham Hermann, Lorenz Hermann, the two Hageman brothers,
</p>
<p>Habizreiter, Heineman, Charles Bock, Heumann, and others from the
</p>
<p>North Side group and Lake View.
</p>
<p>Another station in great danger that night was that on Larrabee Street,,
</p>
<p>in charge of Lieut. John Baus, with forty-eight officers. It is located on
</p>
<p>the northwest corner of Larrabee Street and North Avenue, and is a two-
</p>
<p>story brick building with a basement. This basement contains a cell-room
</p>
<p>located in the center of the building, with windows on the North Avenue
</p>
<p>side, and that side twas chosen for the scene of operations. The men
</p>
<p>especially relied upon to blow up this building were Lingg, Seliger, Muntz-
</p>
<p>enberg, Huber, Thielen and Hirschberger, and they, together with other
</p>
<p>members of the North Side group, lingered in the vicinity, loaded with
</p>
<p>bombs, and waiting only to see "the heavens illuminated" or to receive a
</p>
<p>message from one of the runners. But before they knew what had trans-
</p>
<p>pired at the Haymarket a patrol wagon dashed out of the station and
</p>
<p>whizzed by with a load of officers. This dazed them, and they hurried to
</p>
<p>Neff's Hall to learn particulars and receive new instructions. When they
</p>
<p>got there Neff told them that they were all a set of cowards and advised
</p>
<p>them to go home. They took his advice and were glad to crawl back into-
</p>
<p>their holes.
</p>
<p>Webster Avenue Station, in charge of Lieut. Elias E. Lloyd, with forty-
</p>
<p>four officers, also received attention. The building is a two-story frame
</p>
<p>located on the north side of the street, near Lincoln Avenue, and its prin-
</p>
<p>cipal apartment, the roll-call room, is on the first floor facing the street.

</p>
<p>The men especially assigned to the destruction of this station were Ernst
</p>
<p>Hubner, Gustav Lehman, Otto Lehman, Jebolinski and Lange, backed by
</p>
<p>several other frowsy and low-skulled sneaks, and these hovered around the
</p>
<p>station, hiding in dark recesses whenever some one casually passed along
</p>
<p>the sidewalk, or dodging into an alley whenever an officer was discovered
</p>
<p>approaching them. They all waited for "the signal which never came,"
</p>
<p>and, getting tired of stimulating each other with a courage they did not
</p>
<p>possess, they finally concluded to adjourn to Neff's Hall. Whenever, on
</p>
<p>the way to that place, one upbraided the other for not throwing a bomb,
</p>
<p>A NO THER TR YS TING-PL A CE.

</p>
<p>each would point to the fact that the area in front of the building was
</p>
<p>always occupied by officers sitting in easy chairs and sniffing the evening
</p>
<p>breeze, and there was no chance to get near the cell-room ; but they all
</p>
<p>promised one another that they would go back and blow the building into
</p>
<p>smithereens and the officers into shreds of flesh, regardless of personal
</p>
<p>consequences, if they should hear "good news" at Neff's. But they did
</p>
<p>not go back. Lieut. Lloyd was not called on for assistance at the Hay-
</p>
<p>market until about eleven o'clock, and by that time the cowards had got
</p>
<p>their information at Neff's and were glad for an excuse to make a "bee line "
</p>
<p>for home, if the hovels they lived in can be dignified by that designation.
</p>
<p>There is no doubt that these wretches would have blown up the station
</p>
<p>if the police had dispersed the
</p>
<p>Haymarket meeting earlier in
</p>
<p>the evening, but by waiting so
</p>
<p>long they lost what little courage
</p>
<p>they had. There was no patrol
</p>
<p>wagon attached to this station
</p>
<p>at that time, but, as one of them
</p>
<p>told me afterwards, the Anarch-
</p>
<p>ists stood ready to hurl a bomb
</p>
<p>into a street-car had the officers
</p>
<p>come out earlier to take the cars
</p>
<p>in order to hasten to the assist-
</p>
<p>ance of the force at the Hay-
</p>
<p>market. They intended to make
</p>
<p>their work complete, and they
</p>
<p>were all well provided with
</p>
<p>bombs, even though they were
</p>
<p>rather short on courage. This
</p>
<p>was a part of the gang which
</p>
<p>had an appointment at Lincoln
</p>
<p>Park, only five blocks from the station, and some of them sought there
</p>
<p>early in the evening for a large number of recruits who failed to materialize

</p>
<p>when danger was in sight.
</p>
<p>The spot chosen for the meeting-place in Lincoln Park was at "Schiller's
</p>
<p>Denkmal " (monument). Here it was that a few gathered, but, not finding
</p>
<p>as many present as they expected, they separated to the several localities
</p>
<p>assigned them for the execution of their plot.
</p>
<p>It will be recalled that, at the Monday night meeting preceding the Hay-
</p>
<p>market riot, those living on the North Side were ordered to report at Lin-
</p>
<p>coln Park for definite instructions, and those on the West Side at Wicker
</p>
<p>Park, and the order seems to have been obeyed by a few of the more cour-
</p>
<p>ageous Anarchists.

<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>The vicinity of the Schiller monument was the place also where those
</p>
<p>who had been arrested and had made confessions met, along with other
</p>
<p>Anarchists, on the night preceding the taking of testimony in the trial of
</p>
<p>the prisoners, and on this occasion, Mr. Furthmann tells me, they agreed,
</p>
<p>with one exception, to inform the prosecution that they would not take the
</p>
<p>witness-stand to testify to the matters they had revealed to the State. If
</p>
<p>they were put on as witnesses, they agreed, they could swear that all they
</p>
<p>had told me and Mr. Furthmann with reference to the conspiracy was pure
</p>
<p>and unadulterated false-
</p>
<p>hood. Mr. Waller refused
</p>
<p>to be a party to such an
</p>
<p>agreement, and by his
</p>
<p>stubborn stand he caused
</p>
<p>several of the other wit-
</p>
<p>nesses for the State to
</p>
<p>change their minds and
</p>
<p>stick to the truth. Others,
</p>
<p>however, held out, and,
</p>
<p>when asked by the State
</p>
<p>to appear, refused. Waller
</p>
<p>proved a very strong wit-
</p>
<p>ness, and, as Mr. Furth-
</p>
<p>mann says, not one of the
</p>
<p>witnesses for the defense
</p>
<p>dared to contradict his
</p>
<p>testimony.

<p>the night in question

<p>thirty-four officers. It is a two-story brick building with basement, and

<p>is situated at the northwest corner of Hinman and Paulina Streets.
</p>
<p>The basement is used as a lock-up for the detention of prisoners, and
</p>
<p>all the offices are located on the first floor, facing Paulina Street. The
</p>
<p>patrol-wagon barn is situated in the rear of the station, contiguous to an

<p>alley, through which the street is reached. Around this locality between

<p>eighty and a hundred Anarchists gathered for work and to await the

</p>
<p>signal. Mende and Sisterer were at the head of this murderous gang.
</p>
<p>Some were to exploit with rifles from the alley north of the station and
</p>
<p>on the east side of the street; others, with dynamite bombs, were to
</p>
<p>look after the officers in the rooms where they might happen to be most
</p>
<p>numerous, and those with revolvers were to station themselves in the alley
</p>
<p>directly behind the station to shoot down any of the officers who might come
</p>
<p>out in the patrol wagon, and also to kill the horses. Others, again, with
</p>
<p>revolvers, were to post themselves in front of the station to kill those who
</p>
<p>might escape the deadly bombs and seek safety by rushing into the street.
</p>
<p>The riflemen were to come as a reserve force to shoot down any who might
</p>
<p>have escaped both the revolvers and bombs. They were a desperate set
</p>
<p>and appeared determined on the execution of the plot. The men who com-
</p>
<p>posed the gang were Germans, Bohemians and Poles, all members of the"
</p>
<p>West Side group, and some outsiders who worked in freight-houses and
</p>
<p>lumber-yards, and not one of them had any love for a policeman. This
</p>
<p>district had been for several years the scene of numerous strikes, and, as the
</p>
<p>officers had always suppressed the rioters, the latter were viciously dis-
</p>
<p>posed towards the guardians of the peace. Some of these reds were very
</p>
<p>anxious to see the work of annihilation commence, and they loitered around
</p>
<p>in small squads so as not to arouse suspicion until they could learn whether
</p>
<p>the- revolution had been inaugurated at the Haymarket meeting. There
</p>
<p>was no call on this station for assistance at the time of the explosion, as
</p>
<p>Inspector Bonfield thought it possible that trouble might arise at McCor-
</p>
<p>mick's, and the officers in that locality might thus be required in that direc-
</p>
<p>tion ; and as the diabolical conspirators saw no officers or patrol wagon
</p>
<p>move out, they became anxious to know how the Haymarket affair had termi-
</p>
<p>nated, and one by one they sneaked away from their hiding-places. When
</p>
<p>they finally learned particulars about the shooting, they ran home, and, like
</p>
<p>the cowards they were, kept under cover for several days. Later in the
</p>
<p>evening one company was ordered from this station to guard Desplaines
</p>
<p>Street, after the wounded officers had all been brought from the Haymarket.
</p>
<p>When the wagon had reached Halsted and Harrison Streets, however,
</p>
<p>Capt. O'Donnell halted it and ordered the officers back to the station, as
</p>
<p>it had been ascertained that all the Anarchists had sought their homes for

<p>the night.
</p>
<p>It was very fortunate that the officers were not called out earlier in the
</p>
<p>evening. If Inspector Bonfield had ordered them to report a few moments
</p>
<p>after the riot, very few of the men would have escaped alive. I have since
</p>
<p>learned that the brigands who were sneaking around that station that
</p>
<p>night numbered nearly one hundred, and as one-half of them were under
</p>
<p>the influence of liquor, it is very likely that they would have committed
</p>
<p>desperate deeds had the occasion offered.

</p>
<p>THE case was now in condition to be turned over to the courts. The
</p>
<p>detective work was done, and, as I flatter myself, and as the result
</p>
<p>proved, well done. A deliberate and fiendish conspiracy to bring about
</p>
<p>riot, destruction and death had been proven. The Haymarket gathering
</p>
<p>was projected to invite a police attack, and this attack was to be the pre-
</p>
<p>text for dynamite, murder and the social revolution. Of course much of
</p>
<p>the information given in the preceding pages was not used either in the
</p>
<p>grand jury room or at the trial. It was not necessary. State's Attorney
</p>
<p>Grinnell, with his usual wisdom and tact, selected only the best, strongest
</p>
<p>and most reliable witnesses, and left out the minor ones. The statements
</p>
<p>of all those who " squealed " were conclusive, criminative and corroborative,
</p>
<p>but their presentation in court would have simply lumbered up the case.

<p>As a result of the energetic work of Coroner Hertz the principal con-
</p>
<p>spirators had been bound over, without bail, at the inquest.
</p>
<p>The grand jury was impaneled on the i7th of May, 1886, and was com-
</p>
<p>posed of the following named persons : John N. Hills (foreman), George
</p>
<p>Watts, Peter Clinton, George Adams, Charles Schultz, Thomas Broderick,
</p>
<p>William Bartels, Fred. Wilkinson, P. J. Maloney, John Held, A. J. Grover,
</p>
<p>Frank N. Seavert, E. A. Jessel, Theodore Schultze, Alfred Thorp, N. J.
</p>
<p>Webber, Adolph Wilke, Fred Gall, Edward S. Dreyer, John M. Clark,
</p>
<p>John C. Neemes, N. J. Quan and T. W. Hall.
</p>
<p>Judge John G. Rogers delivered a long, able and forcible charge to the
</p>
<p>members of this grand jury. He first called attention to the necessity of
</p>
<p>their not being influenced in their acts by fear, favor or affection, and then
</p>
<p>dwelt upon what constitutes freedom of speech. He said :
</p>
<p>"We hear a good deal these days about what is called the freedom of
</p>
<p>speech. Now, there is a good deal of misconception of the Constitution of
</p>
<p>the United States and of the Constitution of the State of Illinois, and I may
</p>
<p>say of all States in the Union, upon this question of freedom of speech. I
</p>
<p>have copied the provisions upon which persons rely who continually say

</p>
<p>that in this free country men have a right to assemble men have a right
</p>
<p>to speak and say what they please. There is no such right. There is no
</p>
<p>such constitutional right. The constitutional rights as expressed in the
</p>
<p>Constitution are : 'That Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom
</p>
<p>of speech or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble
</p>
<p>and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.' The same
</p>
<p>principle is carried along into the State Constitutions; and in the Constitu-
</p>
<p>376
</p>
<p>THE RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH.
</p>
<p>377
</p>
<p>tion of the State of Illinois, and in its Bill of Rights, there is a provision
</p>
<p>that ' every person may freely speak, write and publish on all subjects,
</p>
<p>being responsible for the use of that liberty.' And in another provision the
</p>
<p>people have a right ' to assemble in peaceable manner, to consult for the
</p>
<p>common good, to make known their opinions to their representatives, and
</p>
<p>to apply for a redress of grievances.' You will perceive in a moment that
</p>
<p>the construction of the United States constitutional right has
</p>
<p>been interpreted, if I may so express myself, in the Consti-
</p>
<p>tution of the State of Illinois, and that interpretation is the
</p>
<p>one that the courts have always recognized, and that, while a
</p>
<p>man may speak freely and write and publish upon all sub-
</p>
<p>jects, he is responsible for the abuse of the liberty of speech.
</p>
<p>I refer to these constitutional rights because some men are
</p>
<p>so inconsistent as to say there shall be no law for any such
</p>
<p>rights, yet claim the protection of these rights in the broadest
</p>
<p>sense, and, with an interpretation satisfactory to their own
</p>
<p>minds, that a man may get up, and, in a public speech to
</p>
<p>a public crowd, advise murder and arson, the destruction of
</p>
<p>property and the injury of people. That is a wild license which
</p>
<p>the Constitution of this country has never recognized any
</p>
<p>more than it has been recognized in the worst despotisms of
</p>
<p>old and of monarchical Europe. I hope and you hope it
</p>
<p>will never be recognized."
</p>
<p>The eminent jurist then illustrated the point of responsi-
</p>
<p>bility. If, said he, he should get up and there advise mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the jury that the foreman ought to be hanged for some
</p>
<p>assumed offense, he would be advising the commission of a
</p>
<p>crime ; and if his advice was followed he himself who incited
</p>
<p>the hanging would be just as guilty of murder as the ones
</p>
<p>who did it. He next referred to the Haymarket riot and
</p>
<p>counseled the jury to look not only to the man who actually
</p>
<p>committed the crime, but to those who stood behind him,
</p>
<p>who actually advised it. He held that the men who so advised

</p>
<p>were equally guilty and should be held responsible for it.
</p>
<p>"What," he said "is an incendiary speech but inciting men
</p>
<p>to commit wild acts ? " He spoke of the red flag in Chicago
</p>
<p>and said : " What is a red flag in a procession, or a black
</p>
<p>flag, but a menace, a threat ? It is understood to be emble-
</p>
<p>matic of blood, and that no quarter will be given. Flags of NEEBE'S SWORD
</p>
<p>, ... AND BELT.
</p>
<p>that sort ought not to be permitted to be borne in proces-
</p>
<p>sions in this city." He referred to the labor troubles of the Knights of
</p>
<p>Labor, which, he acknowledged, happily had no connection with the Hay-
</p>
<p>market or with Anarchy, and then, for the guidance of the jury in reaching
</p>
<p>conclusions on the Anarchistic conspiracy, he quoted the statutes on what
</p>
<p>constituted conspiracy and the penalty for riots. In closing Judge Rogers
</p>
<p>counseled the jury to consider all evidence submitted with fairness and
</p>
<p>impartiality.
</p>
<p>378 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>The next day the grand jury entered upon its work. A great many wit-
</p>
<p>nesses appeared before it, but many of them were not required at the trial, as
</p>
<p>their testimony would neither add to nor detract from the strength of the
</p>
<p>case. Facts were brought out under the latitude allowed in a grand jury room
</p>
<p>that could not, under court procedure, be brought into a cause on trial
</p>
<p>because of their not bearing directly on the charges, or not tending to sup-
</p>
<p>ply some material connecting link in the chain of evidence. Some of this
</p>
<p>testimony, while not serving to throw any special light upon the conspiracy,
</p>
<p>may yet illustrate some phases of Anarchy growing out of the propagation
</p>
<p>of Anarchistic ideas and features incidental to the cause celebre; and for
</p>
<p>that purpose I have carefully scanned over the official grand jury reports
</p>
<p>and selected such omitted points as. will serve to give a better general idea
</p>
<p>of the whole subject.*
</p>
<p>The sale and circulation of Anarchistic literature in Chicago was one of
</p>
<p>the matters into which inquiry was made. Anton Laufermann, a Division
</p>
<p>Street bookseller, testified that Most had written "The Solution of the
</p>
<p>Socialistic Question," " The Movement in Old Rome, or Caesarism," " The
</p>
<p>Bastile at Platzensee," and other works, including "The Science of War."
</p>
<p>It appeared that these Anarchistic books were not, as a rule, handled by
</p>
<p>booksellers.
</p>
<p>Edward Deuss, city editor of the Arbeiter-Zeitung, told the grand jury
</p>
<p>that the dynamite book Most's " Science of War " was usually sold by
</p>
<p>men at picnics and similar gatherings, and that a book-store would be the
</p>
<p>ast place to look for it. The men who peddled this literature were volun-
</p>
<p>teers who made no money out of the sales.
</p>
<p>This evidence was corroborated by other persons. The plan seemed to
</p>
<p>be to scatter Most's works quietly among the people, thus avoiding any of
</p>
<p>the difficulties or dangers which might follow from open and undisguised
</p>
<p>sale. The main source of supply was manifestly the Arbeiter-Zeitung
</p>
<p>office. The books were easy to get : nearly all the arrested Anarchists had
</p>
<p>copies of the dynamite book in their possession. One of the most persistent
</p>
<p>colporteurs was Muntzenberg. The hundreds of copies of incendiary books
</p>
<p>and pamphlets were passed around from one man to another, and it is out
</p>
<p>of the question to attempt to estimate the amount of injury they have done.

</p>
<p>The evidence upon this point so much, at least, as came from the office of
</p>
<p>the Arbeiter-Zeitung was unsatisfactory. This, however, was to have been
</p>
<p>expected when the character and peculiar beliefs of the witnesses is con-
</p>
<p>sidered. For instance, Gerhardt Lizius, an editorial writer on this paper,
</p>
<p>after being questioned, without satisfactory results, about the interior
</p>
<p>arrangements of the Arbeiter-Zeitung and various articles about the
</p>
<p>premises, was asked to define Anarchy and Socialism.
</p>
<p>"A Socialist," he said, "wants the State to regulate everything, while
</p>
<p>we don't want any authority whatever. We want the people to associate
</p>
<p>THE CREED OF THE "JtEDS." 379
</p>
<p>themselves for production and consummation (of the highest good), accord-
</p>
<p>ing to their own desires."
</p>
<p>"How does it happen that capital is in your way? " asked Mr. GrinnelL
</p>
<p>"Because the capitalist has taken something from us that is not his,
</p>
<p>that we have created."
</p>
<p>"What is the manner the Anarchists have adopted in reaching that
</p>
<p>which they have not got now?"
</p>
<p>"We want to get it any way we can peaceably if we can, and forcibly
</p>
<p>if we must."
</p>
<p>"Even to the extent of a capitalist's life ? "
</p>
<p>"Yes."
</p>
<p>" Do you believe in the use of dynamite ? "
</p>
<p>"Yes."
</p>
<p>"You say that you should not divide your property with your neighbor.
</p>
<p>Why should the capitalist?"
</p>
<p>"We don't want him to divide anything. We want him to make it
</p>
<p>public property. He has got as much right to it as we have. Everybody,
</p>
<p>according to our view, should have the right of life, liberty and the pursuit
</p>
<p>of happiness. That means that I should have the right to the means of
</p>
<p>life, and that means, of course, that we should have the right to everything
</p>
<p>that nature gives us, so that every man, if he wants, can work, and every-
</p>
<p>body make a living. If he don't want to work, then of course he should
</p>
<p>not make a living."
</p>
<p>"The Arbeiter-Zeitung was an Anarchistic paper? "
</p>
<p>"Yes."
</p>
<p>"Did the Arbeiter-Zeitung divide its things ? "
</p>
<p>"There was nothing to divide there. We didn't make any money."
</p>
<p>"Supposing that you and I should want the same thing how would
</p>
<p>you settle that question ? "
</p>
<p>"Well, I guess there can be more than one of these things made."
</p>
<p>" I might want a cow that you would want, or a horse ; you might want
</p>
<p>the same thing how would you settle that matter?"
</p>
<p>"I work for it and get it."
</p>
<p>"I thought you did not believe in that?" continued Mr. GrinnelL

<p>"You did not hear me say anything of the kind. I said that we should
</p>
<p>have the right to work so that we could make a living. We didn't want
</p>
<p>anything without work."
</p>
<p>"Now, you figure that a man who has got a hundred thousand dollars
</p>
<p>by reason of having worked hard, stands in your way ; isn't that your idea ? "
</p>
<p>"Yes."
</p>
<p>"Suppose I have got ten cows and you don't get any; you have been
</p>
<p>lazy and haven't earned your ten cows. Now, how do you get half of my
</p>
<p>cows?"

</p>
<p>"You are looking at this thing from the standpoint of the present system
</p>
<p>of society. It is impossible for any of you gentleman, if you are not Social-
</p>
<p>ists and don't understand what Socialism is, to get at the idea at all as to
</p>
<p>how things are run. You have to look at it from the standpoint of
</p>
<p>Socialism."
</p>
<p>" Your idea is to have society without any law ? "
</p>
<p>"The Government is only for the oppression of people. We would
</p>
<p>have to organize for some purposes."
</p>
<p>"Supposing this Government should get something in its mails that you
</p>
<p>would happen to want, should you have a right to take it ? "
</p>
<p>"No, sir."
</p>
<p>" Suppose you did take it, what would be done with you ?"
</p>
<p>"No man is supposed to take anything that does not belong to him."
</p>
<p>" You would have law to punish people, wouldn't you ? "
</p>
<p>"No, sir."
</p>
<p>Being asked if he had seen about the Arbeiter-Zeitung office any imple-
</p>
<p>ments of warfare, Lizius answered in the negative not even pistols or
</p>
<p>anything of that kind.
</p>
<p>" Do you believe that the man who threw the bomb over there [meaning
</p>
<p>the Haymarket] did right?"
</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."
</p>
<p>"And that it was a righteous act in shooting down the policemen?"
</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."
</p>
<p>The reason he advanced for his belief was that it was an act of self-
</p>
<p>defense; that the police, according to his knowledge, had attacked the
</p>
<p>crowd with clubs before the bomb was thrown. This sort of misinforma-
</p>
<p>tion seems to have been spread among the ignorant Anarchists, and Lizius,
</p>
<p>when he said he believed it, knew better and simply adopted it as an
</p>
<p>excuse for their acts.

<p>ANARCHIST AMMUNITION II. FROM PHOTOGRAPHS.

</p>
<p>" If you had a good cause, would you lie ? Would you lie to save a life?"
</p>
<p>"If it hung upon such a slender thread as that, I would."
</p>
<p>"Would you, if you thought it would help the cause of Anarchy?"
</p>
<p>"I don't see how it could."
</p>
<p>Among the many witnesses examined in the grand jury room was
</p>
<p>Ernst Legner. It will be remembered that the defense, at the trial,
</p>
<p>claimed that this man had been spirited away by the prosecution. This
</p>
<p>was done, of course, with a view to damaging the case of the State before
</p>
<p>the jury. Now, the facts are these : Legner's name was placed on the
</p>
<p>back of the indictment somehow I do not know why. Certainly neither
</p>
<p>the State nor the defense could have used him, and he would have been
</p>
<p>even less valuable for the prisoners than for the prosecution. Legner was
</p>
<p>a man who was sure of nothing. His testimony before the grand jury was
</p>
<p>continually and invariably qualified by the statement that he "could not be
</p>
<p>positive;" that he "was not sure." For instance, here is some of his
</p>
<p>testimony :
</p>
<p>Did he meet Chris Spies at that meeting? He could not say. "I saw
</p>
<p>him that night, but I couldn't say whether I saw him there. I don't recol-
</p>
<p>lect. I couldn't say positive. I couldn't say anything positive about that. "
</p>
<p>This answer prompted Mr. Grinnell to ask : "Since when have you
</p>
<p>grown so unpositive ? "
</p>
<p>"Well, in that way, I guess ever since," was his lucid reply.
</p>
<p>"You remember me, don't you, down at the Central Station, talking
</p>
<p>with you?"
</p>
<p>"No, sir."
</p>
<p>"Don't you remember coming in, seeing me and your brother
</p>
<p>come in? "
</p>
<p>"Well, that was in the City Hall."
</p>
<p>" Well, that is what we call Central Station. You saw me there, did
</p>
<p>you ? "
</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."
</p>
<p>" You remember your brother told you he had advised you to keep
</p>
<p>away from those people, and advised you to tell the truth about this trans-
</p>
<p>action ? "

</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."
</p>
<p>" And you then and there told me that you saw Chris Spies right near
</p>
<p>that wagon that night ? "
</p>
<p>"Well, I might have seen him, but I won't say anything positive on
</p>
<p>that."
</p>
<p>" Have you seen him since then ?"
</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, I did."
</p>
<p>"When?"
</p>
<p>"I saw him yesterday."
</p>
<p>" / COULD NOT SA Y POSITIVE." 383
</p>
<p>"And he talked you spoke to him about this case then, didn't you?"
</p>
<p>" I only spoke to him I told him that he looked pale, and that was all
</p>
<p>the speaking, and he went off. I was going west, and he was going east."
</p>
<p>" Now, why should there be any confusion in your mind to-day where
</p>
<p>you saw him that night ? "
</p>
<p>" Well, I saw him that night, but I could not say positive whether I
</p>
<p>saw him there or not, at the meeting."
</p>
<p>"You said a moment ago that you looked around, and you thought you
</p>
<p>saw him right there ? "
</p>
<p>"Well, yes. That is where I said ; I could not say positive ; I saw him,
</p>
<p>but I could not say positive."
</p>
<p>This sort of fire was kept up for some time, but the witness always
</p>
<p>dodged behind " I could not say positive." He was asked how long it was
</p>
<p>after August Spies got through speaking when he (Spies) left, but the only
</p>
<p>answer was : "Well, that is something I don't know certain."
</p>
<p>Now, why should the State want such a witness, or what interest could it
</p>
<p>have in spiriting him away ? He certainly developed a remarkable want
</p>
<p>of memory, and with his testimony before the grand jury the de-
</p>
<p>fendants, if they had put him on the stand, could not have utilized him
</p>
<p>on their side. If he knew anything, as would seem to be the case, judging
</p>
<p>from his brother's advice to tell everything and some statements he had
</p>
<p>previously made to the State's Attorney, it all must have been in favor of
</p>
<p>the State. It is a justifiable conclusion that Chris Spies, on meeting him
</p>
<p>the day preceding his appearance before the grand jury, must have
</p>
<p>influenced him to testify the way he did. The truth about the whole
</p>
<p>matter is that the defendants would not have touched Legner had he been
</p>
<p>procurable, and if he went out of the city it must have been at their
</p>
<p>instigation. The above samples of his testimony show that his appear-
</p>
<p>ance on the stand would have made him dead timber to either side.
</p>
<p>A good deal was also said about the absence of Mr. Brazleton, an
</p>
<p>Inter-Ocean reporter, from the witness-stand. He was not produced by the
</p>
<p>State because many of his statements were not of a positive character.
</p>
<p>As there were so many other witnesses who had paid special attention
</p>
<p>to the incendiary character of the speeches, and remembered distinctly the

</p>
<p>various details in connection with the Haymarket meeting, there was no
</p>
<p>occasion to use Brazleton as a witness. All the others who were put on the
</p>
<p>stand gave fuller particulars and corroborated each other in all essential
</p>
<p>points. Had the general information of the others been of the same nature
</p>
<p>as that of Brazleton, it might have been well to have used him as a witness,
</p>
<p>but, with so much direct testimony as the State possessed, his evidence was
</p>
<p>not necessary. The defense simply sought to make a point on his absence
</p>
<p>that is all.
</p>
<p>A great deal has been said with reference to Schnaubelt. There is
</p>

</p>
<p>no doubt that he threw the fatal bomb. The defense at the trial of Spies
</p>
<p>and the others sought, however, to discredit such a belief. They asserted
</p>
<p>that there was not an iota of evidence to sustain such an opinion, and for
</p>
<p>their part they did not believe it. Per contra, it may be said that if he was
</p>
<p>innocent he took the wrong course to show it. Schnaubelt was arrested by
</p>
<p>Officers Palmer and Boyd, of the Central Station. Before the grand jury
</p>
<p>Palmer testified as follows :
</p>
<p>" I was told that he was working at 224 Washington Street, rooms 5 and
</p>
<p>6. I went up there and found
</p>
<p>him and brought him to the
</p>
<p>Central Station. That was
</p>
<p>on the 6th of this month."
</p>
<p>"Did he have whiskers,
</p>
<p>or not? "
</p>
<p>"His face was shaved
</p>
<p>clean, except a mustache."
</p>
<p>"You had been looking
</p>
<p>for a man with whiskers? "
</p>
<p>" Yes. I was told by his
</p>
<p>employer that he shaved his
</p>
<p>whiskers off the morning
</p>
<p>after the riot."
</p>
<p>" Did he say anything to
</p>
<p>you about having shaved
</p>
<p>himself?"
</p>
<p>" I asked him why ne
</p>
<p>shaved, and he said he al-
</p>
<p>ways did it in the summer
</p>

<p>" Did you have any talk
</p>
<p>with him when you brought him to the Central Station ?"
</p>
<p>" Yes. I asked him if he was at the scene of the riot on the Tuesday
</p>
<p>night previous, and he said he was. I asked him where he was. He said
</p>
<p>he was up on the'wagon. I asked him where he was when the bomb was
</p>
<p>thrown. He said he was on the wagon half a minute before the bomb was
</p>
<p>thrown, but he had got off, and when it exploded he supposed he was about
</p>
<p>fifty feet from the wagon."
</p>
<p>" He was let go that morning ? "
</p>
<p>"Yes."

<p>" Tell us about his place of work and what you found out yesterday ? "
</p>
<p>"Captain Schaack sent a couple of men to me yesterday to find out if
</p>
<p>we could get this man again. I took them over to where I had found him
</p>
<p>pre\ ? iously. His employer told me that after he got away from me on the
</p>
<p>6th of this month [May] he came back and finished the day's work, and he
</p>
<p>had not shown up from that time to this. His tools were there, and he did
</p>
<p>not call for his money. His sister had called for the money several days
</p>
<p>after he quit, but he did not give it to her."
</p>
<p>"He had a good job, didn't he?"
</p>
<p>"He was a machinist, working at a turning-lathe."
</p>
<p>Schnaubelt was described as having sandy whiskers, about six feet
</p>
<p>tall, weighing about 190 pounds, large and bony, not very fleshy, and about
</p>
<p>twenty-four years of age.
</p>
<p>Lieut. John Shea, then in charge of the Central Station, testified to the
</p>
<p>same facts and that the police had been unable to find the man in the city.
</p>
<p>At the time there were no strong circumstances, connecting Schnaubelt
</p>
<p>with the massacre, but suspicious evidence ought to have held him in cus-
</p>
<p>tody for a day or two until all his antecedents could have been inquired
</p>
<p>into. His release was a sad mistake, and the fact that he hastened out of
</p>
<p>the city shows the fear he had of being directly connected with the throw-
</p>
<p>ing of the bomb. The evidence of various parties points to him as the
</p>
<p>guilty party, and it was fortunate for him that he escaped.
</p>
<p>C. M. Hardy, a leading attorney of Chicago, testified to a conversa-
</p>
<p>tion which he had had with Spies the day before the Haymarket tragedy.
</p>
<p>During this conversation, which occurred accidentally in a restaurant,
</p>
<p>" Spies," to use the words of the witness, " turned and said to me laugh-
</p>
<p>ingly, 'Are you with us?' 'Well,' I said, ' If you mean that I am in favor
</p>
<p>of the laborer getting well paid for his labor, I am with you, but no further
</p>
<p>than that.' 'Well,' he said, still laughing, 'you had better be, for we are
</p>
<p>going to raise h 1,' and then went on."
</p>
<p>On the 28th of May the grand jury concluded its labors and returned
</p>
<p>into court fifteen indictments for murder, conspiracy and riot, against Spies,
</p>
<p>Parsons, Fischer, Engel, Lingg, Fielden, Schwab, Neebe, Schnaubelt and
</p>
<p>some lesser lights in the Anarchistic circle.

<p>The trial began on the igth of June. No case ever brought before the
</p>
<p>Chicago courts excited so much interest or brought out a greater crowd.
</p>
<p>Not one tithe of the throng of people who were eager to see the notorious
</p>
<p>defendants were able to find place in the court-room.
</p>
<p>Judge Joseph E. Gary presided, and with his suave, dignified bearing
</p>
<p>and his prompt manner of handling legal details and technicalities, he im-
</p>
<p>pressed all with the conviction that, while the Anarchists would have a full
</p>
<p>and fair trial, no trifling with the law would be permitted. The case was
</p>
<p>one which not alone interested Chicago, but touched the stability and wel-

</p>
<p>fare of every city of any considerable size in the United States. The eyes
</p>
<p>of the whole country were riveted on Chicago, and the outside world was
</p>
<p>eagerly watching the results of a case, the first in America, to determine
</p>
<p>whether dynamite was to be considered a legal weapon in the settlement of
</p>
<p>socio-political problems in a free republic. Time was when our system of
</p>
<p>government was looked upon abroad as an experiment of doubtful nature,

<p>friends as furnishing no pretext for Socialistic or Anarchistic outbursts of

<p>Anarchistic doctrines. In a speech before the French Legislative Assem-

</p>
<p>388 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>and that the whole civilized world would sit in judgment upon the manner
</p>
<p>in which they performed their duty. They entered into the case with no
</p>
<p>revengeful feelings, but held firmly to their course, mindful of the rights of
</p>
<p>the defendants, but determined to maintain law and justice. The case was
</p>
<p>called on the day indicated, in the main court-room of the Criminal Court
</p>
<p>building, and the moment the State's Attorney had announced his readiness
</p>
<p>to commence proceedings, the defendants' counsel entered a motion for a
</p>
<p>separate trial of each of the prisoners. This was argued and overruled.
</p>
<p>On the morning of June 21, at ten o'clock, everything was in readiness
</p>
<p>for the trial proper, and the work of selecting the jury was entered upon.
</p>
<p>Within the bar of the court sat the eminent counsel of both sides. On the
</p>
<p>left, in front of the bench, there was State's Attorney Grinnell, surrounded
</p>
<p>by his assistants, Francis W. Walker and Edmund Furthmann, and Special
</p>
<p>State's Counsel George C. Ingham, and on the right of the bench sat the
</p>
<p>defendants' attorneys, Capt. W. P. Black, W. A. Foster, Sigismund Zeisler
</p>
<p>and Moses Salomon, flanked by the prisoners and their relatives. The
</p>
<p>remaining space within the bar was occupied by attorneys of the city as
</p>
<p>spectators, and the rest of the court-room was filled with a motley throng,
</p>
<p>including here and there representatives of the fair sex drawn by personal
</p>
<p>interest or moved by morbid curiosity. The prisoners were dressed in their
</p>
<p>best, each with a button-hole bouquet.
</p>
<p>During the preliminary proceedings, as we have noted elsewhere, Par-
</p>
<p>sons had joined his associates, and his bronzed appearance, from out-door
</p>
<p>exposure, was in marked contrast with that of his pale-looking companions.
</p>
<p>The task of selecting a jury proceeded, but it was not an easy thing to
</p>
<p>find men unbiased and unprejudiced. Four weeks were consumed in this
</p>
<p>work, but finally twelve "good men and true" were chosen, as follows:
</p>
<p>F. S. Osborne, Major James H. Cole, S. G. Randall, A. H. Reed, J. H.
</p>
<p>Brayton, A. Hamilton, G. W. Adams, J. B. Greiner, C. B. Todd, C. H.
</p>
<p>Ludwig, T. E. Denker and H. T. Sandford.
</p>
<p>So notable was the trial, and so tremendous the interests involved, that
</p>
<p>the reader will naturally want to know something of the personnel of the
</p>
<p>jury whose verdict vindicated and guaranteed law and order in America :

<p>sented.
</p>
<p>IT was on Thursday, the i5th of July, that the preliminary work was fin-
</p>
<p>ally ended and the court was ready for a formal statement of the case.
</p>
<p>This statement was made by State's Attorney Grinnell, and his arraign-
</p>
<p>ment of the defendants was such a clear, convincing and masterful argu-
</p>
<p>ment giving, as it did, the whole history of the Anarchist conspiracy, and
</p>
<p>foreshadowing eloquently and in detail all the proof which was to be got
</p>
<p>before the jury that I will print here a verbatim copy of his speech,
</p>
<p>believing that the reader will find nowhere else so business-like a statement
</p>
<p>of what these prisoners did and how they did it.
</p>
<p>During the delivery of Mr. Grinnell's remarks the crowded court-room,
</p>
<p>prisoners and sympathizing Anarchists, wounded policemen, judge, jurors
</p>
<p>and representatives of the press hung upon his words with a keen interest
</p>
<p>which has seldom been duplicated in the annals of American jurisprudence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Grinnell said :
</p>
<p>"GENTLEMEN: For the first time in the history of our country are
</p>
<p>people on trial for their lives for endeavoring to make Anarchy the rule,
</p>
<p>and in that attempt for ruthlessly and awfully destroying life. I hope that
</p>
<p>while the youngest of us lives this in his memory will be the last and
</p>
<p>only time in our country when such a trial shall take place. It will or will
</p>
<p>not take place as this case is determined.
</p>
<p>" The State now and at no time hereafter will say aught to arouse your
</p>
<p>prejudices or your indignation, having confidence in the case that we pre-
</p>
<p>sent ; and I hope I shall not at any time during this trial say anything to
</p>
<p>you which will in any way or manner excite your passions. I want your
</p>
<p>reason. I want your careful analysis. I want your careful attention. We
</p>
<p>my associates and myself ask the conviction of no man from malice,
</p>
<p>from prejudice, from anything except the facts and the law. I am here,

</p>
<p>gentlemen, to maintain the law, not to break it ; and, however you may be-
</p>
<p>lieve that any of these men have broken the law through their notions of
</p>
<p>Anarchy, try them on the facts. We believe, gentlemen, that we have a
</p>
<p>case that shall command your respect, and demonstrate to you the truthful-
</p>
<p>ness of all the declarations in it, and, further, that by careful attention and
</p>
<p>close analysis you can determine who are guilty and the nature of the crime.
</p>
<p>"On the 4th of May, 1886, a few short weeks ago, there occurred, at
</p>
<p>what is called Haymarket Square, the most fearful massacre ever witnessed
</p>
<p>or heard of in this country. The crime culminated there you are to find
</p>
<p>the perpetrators. The charge against the defendants is that they are
</p>
<p>THE STATE'S CASE STATED.
</p>
<p>responsible for that act. The testimony that shall be presented to you will
</p>
<p>be the testimony which will show their innocence or their guilty complicity
</p>
<p>in that crime.
</p>
<p>"We have been in this city inclined to believe, as we have all through
</p>
<p>the country, that, however extravagantly men may talk about our laws and
</p>
<p>our country, however severely they may criticise our Constitution and our
</p>
<p>institutions ; that as we are all in favor of full liberty, of free speech, the
</p>
<p>great good sense of our people would never permit acts based upon senti-
</p>
<p>ments which meant the overthrow of law. We have believed it for years ;
</p>
<p>we were taught it at our schools in our infancy, we were taught it in our
</p>
<p>maturer years in school, and all our walks in life thereafter have taught us
</p>
<p>that our institutions, founded on our Constitution, the Declaration of Inde-
</p>
<p>pendence, and our universal free-
</p>
<p>dom, were above and beyond all
</p>
<p>Anarchy. The 4th of May demon-
</p>
<p>strated that we were wrong, that
</p>
<p>we had too much confidence, that a
</p>
<p>certain class of individuals, some
</p>
<p>of them recently come here, as the
</p>
<p>testimony will show, believe that
</p>
<p>here in this country our Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion is a lie. Insults are offered to
</p>
<p>the Declaration of Independence,
</p>
<p>the name of Washington is reviled
</p>
<p>and traduced, and we are taught by
</p>
<p>these men, as the testimony will
</p>
<p>show, that freedom in this country
</p>
<p>means lawlessness and absolute
</p>
<p>licence to do as we please, no
</p>
<p>matter whether it hurts others or
</p>
<p>not. In the light of the 4th of May
</p>
<p>we now know that the preachings
</p>
<p>of Anarchy, the suggestions of these
</p>
<p>defendants hourly and daily for

<p>years, have been sapping our in-
</p>
<p>stitutions, and that where they have
</p>
<p>cried murder, bloodshed, Anarchy
</p>
<p>and dynamite, they have meant
</p>
<p>what they said, and proposed to do
</p>
<p>what they threatened.
</p>
<p>"We will prove, gentlemen, in this case, that Spies no longer ago than
</p>
<p>last February said that they were armed in this city for bloodshed and riot.
</p>
<p>We will prove that he said then that they were ready in the city of Chicago
</p>
<p>for Anarchy, and when told, by a gentleman to whom he made the declara-
</p>
<p>tion, that they ' would be hung like snakes,' said and there was the insult
</p>
<p>to the Father of our Country then he said George Washington was no
</p>
<p>better than a rebel, as if there was any possible comparison between those
</p>
<p>declarations, between that sentiment of Washington's and his noble deeds,
</p>
<p>and the Anarchy of this man. He has said in public meetings and the
</p>
<p>details of them I will not now worry you with he has said in public meet-
</p>
<p>ings for the last year and a half, to go back no further he and Neebe and
</p>

</p>
<p>city of Chicago that the only way to adjust the wrongs of any man was by
</p>
<p>bloodshed, by dynamite, by the pistol, by the Winchester rifle. They have
</p>
<p>advised, as will appear in proof here, that dynamite was cheap, and 'you
</p>
<p>had better forego some luxuries, buy dynamite, kill capitalists, down with
</p>
<p>the police, murder them, dispose of the militia, and then demand your
</p>
<p>rights.' That is Anarchy.
</p>
<p>"On the nth day of October, 1885, in a prominent public hall upon
</p>
<p>the West Side, August Spies, the defendant in this case, and his confreres
</p>
<p>there, introduced a resolution at a public meeting, in which he said that he
</p>
<p>did not believe that the eight-hour movement would do the laboring man
</p>
<p>any good. W T e will prove in this case that he has always been opposed to
</p>
<p>the eight-hour law. That is not what he wants. He wants Anarchy.
</p>
<p>These defendants that I mentioned passed a resolution, which we shall offer
</p>
<p>in evidence here, and it shall be read to you later -to the effect that the
</p>
<p>laboring men must arm, must prepare themselves with rifles and dynamite.
</p>
<p>When ? By the ist of May, 1886, because then would come the contest.
</p>
<p>"I will prove to you that Parsons be it said to the shame of our
</p>
<p>country, because I understand that he was born on our soil that Parsons,
</p>
<p>in an infamous paper published by him, called the Alarm, has defined the
</p>
<p>use of dynamite, told how it should be used, how capitalists could be
</p>
<p>destroyed by it, how policemen could be absolutely wiped from the face of
</p>
<p>the earth by one bomb ; and further has published a plan in his paper of
</p>
<p>street-warfare by dynamite against militia and the authorities.
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen, leaders of any great cause are -either neroes or cowards.
</p>
<p>The testimony in this case will show that August Spies, Parsons, Schwab
</p>
<p>and Neebe are the biggest cowards that I have ever seen in the course of
</p>
<p>my life. They have advised the use of dynamite and have advised the
</p>
<p>destruction of property for months and years in the city of Chicago, and
</p>
<p>now pitifully smile at our institutions, as they have through their lives and,
</p>
<p>like cowards contemplating crime, they sought to establish an alibi for the
</p>
<p>4th of May, of which I will speak directly.
</p>
<p>" I will prove to you further that in January last August Spies told a
</p>
<p>newspaper reporter of integrity, honesty and fidelity that they were going
</p>
<p>to precipitate the matter on or about the ist of May; that he told this man

</p>
<p>how they could dispose of the police, and in that connection he told that
</p>
<p>reporter that they would arrange it so that their meeting should be at or
</p>
<p>near the intersection of two streets. Having this as Randolph Street and
</p>
<p>Desplaines (pointing on map), not calling it any particular name, and that
</p>
<p>he would have a meeting in which there should be assembled large bodies
</p>
<p>of laboring men, of which he falsely claims to be the exponent ; that they
</p>
<p>would be located just above the intersection of the streets ; that he and his
</p>
<p>dynamiters would be there ; that they would be provided with dynamite
</p>
<p>bombs at the place of meeting; that they would hold a meeting there ; that
</p>
<p>the police or the militia would walk up towards them ; that when they got
</p>
<p>up there their dynamite-throwers would be situated on different sides of the
</p>
<p>street near the walks ; that when they proceeded up here they would throw
</p>
<p>the dynamite into their ranks, clean them out and take possession of the
</p>
<p>town. ' But,' said the reporter to him, ' Mr. Spies, that sounds to me like
</p>
<p>braggadocio and vaporing nonsense.' That is, gentlemen, what it has
</p>
<p>sounded to us for years. Let it sound no longer like that to us. Spies said
</p>
<p>to him, red in the face and excited : ' I tell you I am telling the truth, and
</p>
<p>mark my words, that it will happen on or about the ist of May, 1886.'
</p>
<p>AN INSIDIOUS PLOT. 393,
</p>
<p>And the reason he was so ready to say so was because he believes our Con-
</p>
<p>stitution is a lie, our institutions are not worthy of respect, and he desires
</p>
<p>to pose as a leader, although in fact a coward.
</p>
<p>" That is not all, gentlemen. Mr. Spies at that interview at that time
</p>
<p>handed that gentlemanly reporter -T and I will commend him to you now,
</p>
<p>whatever may be your notion of newspaper men. Look at that man when
</p>
<p>he goes upon the stand and judge him by his words and by his appearance.
</p>
<p>He, Spies, did more than what I have said. At that time he handed to the
</p>
<p>newspaper reporter a dynamite bomb, empty almost the exact duplicate
</p>
<p>of the bomb Lingg made which killed the officers ; handed it to this witness
</p>
<p>and said to him : ' These are the bombs that our men are making in the
</p>
<p>city of Chicago, and they are distributed from the Arbeiter-Zeitting office,
</p>
<p>because the men who make them have not the facilities for distributing
</p>
<p>them, and we distribute them here.'
</p>
<p>" Those are facts that will be proven here.
</p>
<p>" I want to suggest to you now, gentlemen, this is a vastly more important
</p>
<p>case than perhaps any of you have a conception of. Perhaps I have been
</p>
<p>with it so long, have investigated it so much, come in contact with such
</p>
<p>fearful and terrible things so often, that my notions may be somewhat exag-
</p>
<p>gerated ; but I think not. I think they are worse even than my conception
</p>
<p>has pictured. The firing upon Fort Sumter was a terrible thing to our
</p>
<p>country, but it was open warfare. I think it was nothing compared with
</p>
<p>this insidious, infamous plot to ruin our laws and our country secretly and
</p>
<p>in this cowardly way ; the strength of our institutions may depend upon this
</p>
<p>case, because there is only one step beyond republicanism that is Anar-
</p>
<p>chy. See that we never take that step, and let us stand to-day as we have
</p>
<p>stood for years, firmly planted on the laws of our country.
</p>
<p>"After teaching Anarchy, bombs, the manufacture of them and every-
</p>
<p>thing of that character for months, and I may say for years, here in town,
</p>
<p>having put the ball in motion, having done everything toward the end they
</p>
<p>declared should be accomplished towards the end they sought then
</p>
<p>began the numerous conspiracies. The beginning of the whole matter was.
</p>
<p>among the nest of snakes in the Arbeiter-Zeitung office, and the foundation
</p>
<p>of the conspiracy, published, notorious and open, was at West Twelfth

<p>Street Turner Hall, on the nth of October last. At that time, on the intro-
</p>
<p>duction of that resolution by Spies, it was opposed by one man in the
</p>
<p>audience, who is a labor agitator, but not an Anarchist opposed by one
</p>
<p>man in that audience, and he was denounced ; he was told to take a back
</p>
<p>seat, and in support of the resolution it was there said by Spies and a man,
</p>
<p>as I understand, by the name of Belz was chairman that the time for
</p>
<p>argument has passed ; the only argument by which to meet these things
</p>
<p>was dynamite and the rifle by force.
</p>
<p>"As is well known, requiring no proof, for a long time before, it was
</p>
<p>arranged by a universal arrangement or consent among all the laboring
</p>
<p>classes in town that there should be a universal strike for eight hours, to
</p>
<p>take place on or about the ist day of May. On the ist day of May began
</p>
<p>those strikes. On the 2nd on the 3d the and was Sunday on the
</p>
<p>3d day of May, on Monday, you will remember from your reading, as it
</p>
<p>will appear in proof here, there was difficulty at McCormick's factory
</p>
<p>down on what they called the Black Road. The fact about that meeting
</p>
<p>was this : A large number of lumber-shovers, or men who work in the
</p>
<p>lumber-yards, had a meeting appointed to wait on the lumber-dealers,.
</p>
<p>394 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>There were a great many of them Bohemians, some Germans, and some of
</p>
<p>other nationalities mostly embraced in those two nationalities that I first
</p>
<p>spoke of, but all nationalities represented there. The chief officers and the
</p>
<p>chief men in the movement were Bohemians. Some of them will be pre-
</p>
<p>sented to you by us. The committee that was to wait upon the lumber-
</p>
<p>dealers was to report there in an open place called the Black Road, or in
</p>
<p>that locality, to the meeting, what the lumber-dealers proposed. In other
</p>
<p>words, a peaceful proposition was made by that committee to the lumber-
</p>
<p>men to accede to eight hours, and a meeting was held there ; the committee
</p>
<p>were to come back from the lumber-dealers and report to that meeting.
</p>
<p>Spies and a man by the name of Fehling who ought also to have been in
</p>
<p>this indictment, and I will say just a word later about that one other man
</p>
<p>whose identity we have not fully established went down there uninvited
</p>
<p>by any of that committee, or by the chairman of it went down there and
</p>
<p>made an inflammatory speech for the purpose of precipitating that riot.
</p>
<p>'That is the truth. It was precipitated. I am rather inclined to think that
</p>
<p>some other of these men were there. I am not going to state anything to
</p>
<p>you here, at any time, in this case, that I do not believe I can prove. I
</p>
<p>know Spies was there, and spoke from the top of a car. He wrote up the
</p>
<p>speech later on, which I will speak of directly. The president of that organ-
</p>
<p>ization down there, the laborers, opposed his speaking and informed the
</p>
<p>people that this man was not one of them, but that he was a Socialist, and
</p>
<p>they did not want to hear him. He insisted upon speaking, and the friend
</p>
<p>that was with him has fled the city and does not dare return. That will be
</p>
<p>in proof. Spies did the unmanly thing that he always does. He exasper-
</p>
<p>ated other people to rush on McCormick's regardless of the president of that
</p>
<p>committee, who desired quiet and peace and desired it honestly, although
</p>
<p>he was in favor of eight hours. But Spies is not anxious for eight hours.
</p>
<p>We will prove that in this case. He does not want eight hours. If the
</p>
<p>laboring men if the bosses and employers in the city of Chicago on the
</p>
<p>ist day of May had universally acceded to the eight-hour project, Spies was
</p>
<p>a dead duck ; they would have had no further use for him, and he didn't
</p>
<p>"want it. Therefore he went down there and exasperated the people, and
</p>
<p>he made a speech. The police didn't come on the ground until after Mc-

</p>
<p>Cormick's was attacked, and until after stones and bombs were used, or
</p>
<p>pistols and lead against McCormick's factory. What does Spies do, this
</p>
<p>redoubtable knight ? He runs away and gets home just as soon as he can. He
</p>
<p>takes a car and comes north. I will say nothing more about that meeting
</p>
<p>for the present. Let us follow Spies. Now, mind you, he saw trouble. He
</p>
<p>had exasperated this crowd to attack McCormick's ; they did attack
</p>
<p>McCormick's, and stones were thrown by the mob at McCormick's men
</p>
<p>some of them they are called scabs ; they didn't happen to belong to any
</p>
<p>union. Of course my opinion about that may be different from some of
</p>
<p>yours ; I will not criticise. I believe one man is just as good as another,
</p>
<p>whether he belongs to a union or not. If he is an honest man and desires
</p>
<p>to work, I think he ought to be permitted to work. But those fellows didn't
</p>
<p>belong to the union. They swam across the river, got away the best they
</p>
<p>could, saved their lives. But what does Spies do ? He rushes away as
</p>
<p>soon as he can, when he sees the starting of the difficulty ; when he has
</p>
<p>got everybody inflamed into frenzy and madness he quietly gets out to save
</p>
<p>his august person ; he quietly gets out and goes away. That is not all. He
</p>
<p>lands that afternoon at the corner of Desplaines and Lake, where there was a
</p>
<p>THE "REVENGE" CIRCULAR. 395
</p>
<p>crowd of other men, laborers meeting there, and pronounces a lie by telling
</p>
<p>them that ' twelve or fourteen of your brothers have been killed at
</p>
<p>McCormick's, and by the bloodhounds, the police.' Spies knew as well
</p>
<p>as anything that he ever knew in his life that he was uttering a falsehood.
</p>
<p>He knew, if he knew anything, that, so far as his observation was concerned,
</p>
<p>not a man had been killed not a single man had been killed and he
</p>
<p>inflamed the people there by his suggestion, heated as he was and showing
</p>
<p>excitement, coming in there at Desplaines and Lake at that meeting, inflam-
</p>
<p>ing those people so that they were then ready to go with the torch and the
</p>
<p>sword and level everything before them.
</p>
<p>"That is not all. He left there about four o'clock in the afternoon,
</p>
<p>perhaps between four and five, and went to this nest of treason and Anar-
</p>
<p>chy, No. 107 Fifth Avenue, and there about five o'clock arrived, heated,
</p>
<p>excited, and told his men not to stop work, that he wanted to use them.
</p>
<p>What did he do ? He then and there wrote what is called the ' Revenge '
</p>
<p>circular. It is written in English and in German. The English part is
</p>
<p>tame, more tame than the German and he knew what he was doing then ;
</p>
<p>there was a plan in that. We have the circular as printed, which will be
</p>
<p>presented to you. We have in addition to that the type from which it was
</p>
<p>printed ; we have in addition to that the manuscript from which the type
</p>
<p>was set. The manuscript is in Spies' handwriting ! That ' Revenge ' cir-
</p>
<p>cular, gentlemen, perpetrated another lie. It said that 'six of your brothers
</p>
<p>have been killed at McCormick's.' He decreased it a little. That ' Re-
</p>
<p>venge ' circular was hurriedly passed out to all the German settlements of
</p>
<p>the town and everywhere, by every possible means. Neebe distributed
</p>
<p>them ; others distributed them. They were ' revenge ; ' revenge for what ?
</p>
<p>Revenge for the declared murder of the brothers of the laboring men at
</p>
<p>McCormick's Monday afternoon when he had no knowledge that a single
</p>
<p>man was killed. I have since learned and shall prove that one man did
</p>
<p>die days or weeks afterwards from wounds he did receive there, and only
</p>
<p>one.
</p>
<p>" I want to suggest another thing to you here. It will appear in proof
</p>
<p>because we have had the German part of that circular translated that
</p>
<p>the German part of that circular is the most infamous thing that ever was

</p>
<p>in print. The translation of the German part of that circular is not like
</p>
<p>the English part. A man picking up the circular who was an English
</p>
<p>scholar as I remember, the English part of the circular comes first, and fol-
</p>
<p>lowing that is the German part and any man, even some of these German
</p>
<p>newspaper men, would pick that up, and the first thing they would read
</p>
<p>would be the English part, not the German. They would read the English
</p>
<p>hastily through and they would say, ' That's some of Spies' vaporing non-
</p>
<p>sense again; nothing very serious about it, but bad bad taste bad
</p>
<p>judgment in inflamed times.' But the revenge circular as printed in Ger-
</p>
<p>man is altogether a different thing It is not only treason and Anarchy,
</p>
<p>but a bid to bloodshed, and a bid to war. Anybody reading the English
</p>
<p>part of that circular would drop it even the Germans. And the German
</p>
<p>newspapers until afterwards did not perceive the dissimilarity between the
</p>
<p>two, the English and the German. Now, where is this matter read ? It is
</p>
<p>fortunate for the English-speaking people that defendants embrace only
</p>
<p>two of that class one of them was born in this country, the other in Eng-
</p>
<p>land. That circular was read among the Germans. That circular was
</p>
<p>spread throughout the western part and the northern part of the city of
</p>
<p>396 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>Chicago and in other places, at the instance of Spies, who had it circulated
</p>
<p>himself. ' Revenge on the bloodhounds, the police.' For his life, in re-
</p>
<p>gard to those who were killed, he could not have known whether anybody
</p>
<p>was killed or not, because he took care of his royal person so speedily after
</p>
<p>the difficulty at McCormick's that he had no chance to know whether any-
</p>
<p>body was killed, and he took good care to see that he was not hurt. So
</p>
<p>much for the ' Revenge ' circular.
</p>
<p>" Now, gentlemen, we are getting down to the 4th of May. There is more
</p>
<p>in it than this. Monday was the 3d day of May ; Tuesday was the 4th, the
</p>
<p>day the bomb was thrown. Everything was ripe with the Anarchists for
</p>
<p>ruining the town. Bombs were to be thrown in all parts of the city of
</p>
<p>Chicago. Everything was to be done that could be done to ruin law and
</p>
<p>order. I wish to say right here, gentlemen, that the proof in this case will
</p>
<p>develop a strange state of facts in regard to the complicity of others in this
</p>
<p>matter, and in that particular perhaps there ought to be some apology for
</p>
<p>myself. The conspiracy was so large, the number of criminals interested
</p>
<p>in that conspiracy so appalling, that I distrusted my own judgment, and,
</p>
<p>whereas in my soul I believed that at least thirty men and perhaps more
</p>
<p>should have been indicted for murder, the developments in the case were of
</p>
<p>that kind, when the grand jury was in session, that the facts could not all
</p>
<p>clearly be known. And further, there was that feeling and inspiration in
</p>
<p>the matter, if you please, that the leaders, the men who have incited these
</p>
<p>things, the men who have caused this anarchy and bloodshed here, and
</p>
<p>who seek for more that they should be picked out and, if possible, pun-
</p>
<p>ished and blotted out.
</p>
<p>"The Arbeiter-Zeitung, the paper itself we shall attempt to show you in
</p>
<p>proof here its circulation, or its sworn issue for a year. We will have them
</p>
<p>translated for you. We will also attempt to show to you from the Alarm, the
</p>
<p>English organ of the Anarchists that is what it is called, just think of it
</p>
<p>the English organ of the Anarchists, published by the redoubtable and
</p>
<p>courageous Parsons. We will show you in proof its writings and its senti-
</p>
<p>ments, its invitations to Anarchy, to bloodshed, to the throwing of bombs,
</p>
<p>and his advice to people how to make bombs.
</p>
<p>" If I prove only this that I have stated to you, it seems to me that from

<p>every principle of law and evidence, from every principle of justice, the
</p>
<p>men whose names I have mentioned should be punished.
</p>
<p>" But one step more. This was Monday night, remember, that Spies
</p>
<p>wrote the ' Revenge ' circular. That was not all he wrote. He himself
</p>
<p>wrote the account of his speech, wrote the account of the McCormick riot,
</p>
<p>wrote his notions about it, and that is in his handwriting. We have the
</p>
<p>manuscript. And in that he said this, gentlemen that 'so far as the
</p>
<p>McCormick matter was concerned it was a failure, and if there only had
</p>
<p>been one bomb the result might have been different.' The one bomb at
</p>
<p>least was supplied by his inflammatory utterances the next night.
</p>
<p>"On Monday evening, after Spies had inflamed these people up there
</p>
<p>on Monday in the daytime, rather, appeared in the Arbeiter-Zeitung, a news-
</p>
<p>paper published at 107 Fifth Avenue it is a four-page paper, it has been
</p>
<p>constantly and carefully read in the progress of this trial by the gentlemen
</p>
<p>seated over there in a row in the Arbeiter-Zeitung appeared on Monday
</p>
<p>in a column devoted to editorial notices, a secret word for the meeting of
</p>
<p>the armed men. That was in German the letter ' Y,' called ypsilon in
</p>
<p>German " Ypsilon, come Monday night." Ypsilon was the secret word
</p>
<p>7 HE SECRET SIGNAL "K" 397
</p>
<p>agreed on by the armed men to meet in secret session, when they saw
</p>
<p>printed in this treasonable sheet that secret word. As I am informed and
</p>
<p>believe from the proof, Balthasar Rau wrote that secret word. The armed
</p>
<p>men of the Anarchists, to be brief, are those of the Anarchists who are will-
</p>
<p>ing to throw bombs and fire pistols behind people's backs. It is divided
</p>
<p>into groups. Why, all their literature from Pittsburg to San Francisco,
</p>
<p>including the pen of Neebe, Spies, Schwab and Parsons all of them have
</p>
<p>advised how to make up groups, based upon the Anarchistic notions. On
</p>
<p>that page appears this secret word. Balthasar Rau is the confidential
</p>
<p>friend of Spies, works in their office ; he is not an editorial writer, he is not
</p>
<p>a writer at all, unless he occasionally essays to say something in print. I
</p>
<p>do not know, but I believe that that is his writing, the letter ' Y ' in Ger-
</p>
<p>man ' Come Monday night.' That is all there was of it. What does it
</p>
<p>mean ? Pursuant to that secret word, on Monday night that is the same
</p>
<p>night that Spies got back from McCormick's on that night the armed
</p>
<p>men did assemble pursuant to ' Ypsilon, come Monday night,' and they
</p>
<p>knew where to go to. They went to Greif's Hall. Greif's Hall is on Lake
</p>
<p>Street, just east of Clinton." Mr. Grinnell indicated the points on a map.
</p>
<p>" This is Zepf's Hall (indicating) ; the name will be mentioned to you.
</p>
<p>Here is Desplaines Street Station, so that you can keep in your mind from
</p>
<p>this map the idea. Here is Desplaines Street Station ; north up here to
</p>
<p>Lake, Zepf's Hall; east, Greif's Hall. They met. Greif's Hall is a four-
</p>
<p>story building, as I remember; a family lives in it, there is a saloon, and
</p>
<p>down in the basement is a place for truck and one thing and another, and
</p>
<p>also a rough-and-ready place for meetings. The armed men . were there ;
</p>
<p>Fischer was there ; Lingg was there ; Engel was there. The armed men
</p>
<p>met there with others other armed men than those that I have mentioned.
</p>
<p>They pass into Greif's Hall; they say to Mr. Greif : ' Have you a hall we
</p>
<p>can take?' He said: 'No, my halls are all occupied ;' one kind of labor
</p>
<p>association was meeting in one hall, and another in another ; but he said,
</p>
<p>' If you want the basement ' and I have a plan and map of the basement - -
</p>
<p>'if you want the basement, go down stairs and hold your meeting.' So
</p>
<p>these men, the numbers of them variously estimated from thirty to sixty,
</p>
<p>meet in that place. Among them were Fischer, Lingg, Engel and Schnau-

</p>
<p>belt. Schnaubelt is in this indictment, and not here. He has run away.
</p>
<p>These men met in this hall underneath the saloon, a dingy and dark base-
</p>
<p>ment the only proper place for conspirators by the light of a dingy lamp
</p>
<p>and they held an organized meeting. The plan of warfare was devised
</p>
<p>not for the next night. I will explain that. But for some night. Engel, a
</p>
<p>man who is gray, has been in this country some years and talks some Eng-
</p>
<p>lish he understands me, andi laughs and smiles at every word I utter
</p>
<p>Engel was at that meeting that night, and told the plan. I am going to be
</p>
<p>brief about the recitation of that plan. That was the most fearfully declared
</p>
<p>plan that I ever heard in my life. It meant destruction to this town abso-
</p>
<p>lutely if this programme had been carried out. Engel said : ' When you
</p>
<p>see printed in the Arbeiter-Zeitung, under the Letter-box, the word ' Ruhe,'
</p>
<p>that night prepare for war.' 'Ruhe' means 'rest,' 'peace.' The
</p>
<p>manuscript for that is in our possession and is in the handwriting of Spies.
</p>
<p>That word on Tuesday morning appeared in the Arbeiter-Zeitung and in a
</p>
<p>double lead, with an emphasis under it, before it and behind it. It meant
</p>
<p>'war.' They understood it; and Engel refers to Fischer in the meeting
</p>
<p>and he says: 'Is not this the order of the Northwest group ?' That is
</p>
<p>3g8 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>another group for conspiracy and treason. Fischer said 'Yes.' As I am
</p>
<p>informed, Fischer undertook to carry the word back to the Arbeiter-Zeitung
</p>
<p>office and have it inserted. Fischer was the foreman of the Arbeiter-Zeitung
</p>
<p>office at that time. He carried the word back, I assume. Spies wrote it
</p>
<p>out, double-leaded it, made it emphatic, and they were ready for war.
</p>
<p>"But that was not all. Somebody had to make the bombs. Lingg was
</p>
<p>there, and he said that he would make the bombs. He was the bomb-maker
</p>
<p>of the Anarchists, and we have found and traced to him at least twenty-two
</p>
<p>of these infernal machines, one of which passed from his hands to the man
</p>
<p>who threw it at the Haymarket Square. I will prove to your absolute
</p>
<p>satisfaction that Lingg made the bomb that killed the officers, and will show
</p>
<p>to you that it was his bomb, and his manufacture alone. Lingg lived at
</p>
<p>No. 442 Sedgwick Street, occupied a room in Seliger's house. Seliger is
</p>
<p>in this indictment for murder also. He is not on trial. I am not yet pre-
</p>
<p>pared to say whether the State will use him as a witness or not. I will
</p>
<p>have a suggestion to make on that subject directly.
</p>
<p>"Lingg was to make the bombs. Engel devised the plan and deliber-
</p>
<p>ately told him over and over so that there would be no mistake. Now, what
</p>
<p>was the plan? That these conspirators should proceed to Lingg's house
</p>
<p>that next night, or before night, and obtain from Lingg the bombs. He
</p>
<p>had already sixteen halves, or eight whole bombs. But he wanted more,
</p>
<p>and they were to be filled with dynamite on Tuesday afternoon.
</p>
<p>" And what next ? Then these people were informed where they could
</p>
<p>obtain them, and he was to go, as he did, in the evening, or between seven
</p>
<p>and eight o'clock, to Neff's Hall, at No. 58 Clybourn Avenue. They went
</p>
<p>to work. There Seliger helped fill the bombs that afternoon. Lingg was
</p>
<p>there. Lingg left in the afternoon. He didn't stay there through it all,
</p>
<p>but came back again. I do not think that Lingg was at the Haymarket
</p>
<p>that night ; he may have been ; I don't think he was. His part on the pro-
</p>
<p>gramme part of it had been performed was to furnish the bombs and
</p>
<p>do the work elsewhere.
</p>
<p>"Now, gentlemen, just look at this plan, and this is the plan that Engel
</p>
<p>told them should be performed. They were to get these bombs ; certain of
</p>
<p>them were to be at the Haymarket Square, where this meeting was ; and in

</p>
<p>this meeting, mind you, in this conspiracy meeting the programme was that
</p>
<p>there should be at least twenty-five thousand laboring men present ; that
</p>
<p>they would not hold the meeting down on the square, but that they would
</p>
<p>get up in the street, because they were out in a great open place there, the
</p>
<p>police could come down on them and clean them all out ; but they must
</p>
<p>get back where the alleys were, instead of holding the meeting down here
</p>
<p>where it was advertised. You see there are two blocks here. Instead of
</p>
<p>holding the meeting on this broad spot here (indicating on the map), they
</p>
<p>were to hold it up here ; and that very thing was discussed down there that
</p>
<p>night in the conspiracy meeting, as to the feasibility of holding it here
</p>
<p>where the police could corner them. Then these individuals with the
</p>
<p>bombs were to distribute themselves in different parts of the city. They
</p>
<p>were to destroy the station-houses ; they were to throw bombs at every
</p>
<p>patrol wagon that they saw going toward the Haymarket Square with
</p>
<p>police officers. They expected there would be a row down there at the
</p>
<p>Haymarket Square, of course. There was going to be one bomb thrown
</p>
<p>there at least, and perhaps more, and that would call the police down ; but
</p>
<p>the police must be taken care of and must not be permitted to go, and they
</p>
<p>THE HAYMARKET MEETING. 399,
</p>
<p>were to be destroyed, absolutely wiped off from the earth by bombs in,
</p>
<p>other parts of the city. And Lingg went around with bombs in his pocket
</p>
<p>that night and desired to throw them at a patrol wagon and was only
</p>
<p>restrained by his friends. And they were to build a fire up toward Wicker
</p>
<p>Park some building was to be set on fire for the purpose of attracting the
</p>
<p>police in that direction and scattering them about. Others were to take
</p>
<p>other parts of the city and burn them so that they would be destroyed.
</p>
<p>" Now, this sounds as if it was a large story. But that is what Spies
</p>
<p>had been talking for years ; that is what Parsons had been talking for
</p>
<p>years ; that is what he came back here so courageously, on the arm of the
</p>
<p>learned counsel on the other side, to hear again in court.
</p>
<p>"That meeting that night was fruitful of great results. A bomb was,
</p>
<p>thrown at the Haymarket, and seven killed and many others injured. It is
</p>
<p>not necessary for me to go into any more of the details of that conspiracy.
</p>
<p>It was carried out to the letter.
</p>
<p>"Now, there is one other little step in this case, gentlemen, that I wish
</p>
<p>to bring to your attention. When that ' Revenge ' circular was circulated,.
</p>
<p>Fischer, immediately thereafter, and at the conspiracy meeting Fischer
</p>
<p>is the foreman printer of the Arbeiter-Zeitung, and the immediate friend of
</p>
<p>Spies and all these people Fischer was to advertise, to see that the
</p>
<p>proper number of people came to that meeting, and he got up an advertise-
</p>
<p>ment, and it was printed. He ordered twenty thousand. That advertise-
</p>
<p>ment will be presented to you in the proof. That advertisement called for
</p>
<p>'Revenge' and 'A big meeting of the workingmen at the Haymarket
</p>
<p>Square on Tuesday night.' Now, you see, the 'Ruhe' had appeared. The
</p>
<p>conspiracy was all complete ; everything was arranged ; there was only one
</p>
<p>step more to make to get the laboring men there because, thank God,,
</p>
<p>all the laboring men were not in this conspiracy. A very few were in it.
</p>
<p>It is to their credit, gentlemen ; and in my investigation in this case I have
</p>
<p>more respect for the laboring man than I had before. The laboring mart
</p>
<p>as a class is an honest man, and when he saw the ' Revenge ' circular and
</p>
<p>the call 'to arms' he stayed away. Fischer had the advertisement printed,,
</p>
<p>and the last sentence is this : 'Workingmen, come armed.' But that was
</p>
<p>a little too much for Spies ; that was too close home. After about five

</p>
<p>thousand of these circulars were printed, Spies orders that sentence
</p>
<p>stricken out ; but the whole twenty thousand were distributed, and with
</p>
<p>Spies' knowledge. Spies was preparing the alibi.
</p>
<p>" On the evening of Tuesday, at 107 Fifth Avenue, there was a meeting
</p>
<p>of these conspirators, of these Anarchists, of what is called the American
</p>
<p>group, that Parsons and Fielden and, I suppose, Spies belong to, and
</p>
<p>some others. That was held at 107 Fifth Avenue. That is at the Arbeit er-
</p>
<p>Zeitung office. They were there on Tuesday night. Parsons was on Hal-
</p>
<p>sted Street, to be sure, but yet seemed anxious to get away and go down to
</p>
<p>this other meeting on the South Side. He went down there. The meet-
</p>
<p>ing was advertised for a large number of laboring men. The laboring men
</p>
<p>did not materialize to any large extent. Between Halsted and Desplaines
</p>
<p>there were hundreds of people walking oackwards and forwards, wondering
</p>
<p>why the meeting did not take place. It was advertised for half past seven ;
</p>
<p>they expected to precipitate the matter at half past seven, because, pursu-
</p>
<p>ant to 'Ruhe' and the other declarations, and pursuant to Engel and
</p>
<p>Lingg and Fischer's arrangement at the conspiracy meeting, they were to
</p>
<p>begin their work in the other parts of the city about eight o'clock, as they
</p>
<p>400 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>expected the police would precipitate the difficulty they would precipi-
</p>
<p>tate the difficulty by the police coming about eight, or between half past
</p>
<p>:seven and eight. Good speakers were advertised, yet no names given.
</p>
<p>Spies went over there that night himself, wandered around, seemed care-
</p>
<p>less, walked over here with his friend Schnaubelt, up to the other street
</p>
<p>with Schwab, too. Schwab went away finally .and went up to Deering.
</p>
<p>They marched backwards and forwards there, and finally Spies comes back
</p>
<p>to the corner here and opens the meeting, and says, when he opens it :
</p>
<p>'We will not obstruct that road on Randolph Street, but will go up here.'
</p>
<p>'So he got where he had always said they would get, just above the inter-
</p>
<p>section of the streets. They got up there on the wagon, and Spies
</p>
<p>opened the meeting.
</p>
<p>''Now, gentlemen, we have got down to the meeting. I have endeav-
</p>
<p>ored to give you, in a kind of historical way, how this thing leads up to,
</p>
<p>without saying specifically, the proof. I have told you that we would prove
</p>
<p>declarations of these men, time out of number, about dynamite and
</p>
<p>bombs, and the destruction of property and the destruction of the
</p>
<p>police. That we will attempt to do. There is no need of my specifying or
</p>
<p>saying what each individual witness will say.
</p>
<p>" Neebe has upheld bloodshed and riot time and again, although from
</p>
<p>all the inquiries put to you it would seem as if he was known as one of
</p>
<p>these peaceable, peaceful, quiet labor organizers.
</p>
<p>" The laboring men did not come to any large extent. There probably
</p>
<p>were not two thousand men there at any time, even early in the evening.
</p>
<p>There were not enough there to get up a riot. They could not get up a
</p>
<p>riot with such a small number as that, and they were compelled to have
</p>
<p>somebody speak to keep what they had ; they were dissolving going
</p>
<p>away. Now, Spies was there. He is the man, I think, that knew of
</p>
<p>' Ruhe ; ' I think that he himself will state I think others will state that
</p>
<p>they knew of all the circumstances about the 'Ruhe,' and about what they
</p>
<p>were going to do. I think the proof will show that he knew of the whole
</p>
<p>conspiracy. He did not stop it. They will undertake to show that he
</p>
<p>tried to. Now, I want you to watch that carefully. We will have some-
</p>
<p>thing to say on that subject as the basis of all this. There never was a great

</p>
<p>criminal in the world, especially if he was a coward, but what, if he under-
</p>
<p>took to commit a great crime and wanted to conceal himself, he prepared
</p>
<p>.an alibi. Parsons, Fielden, Schwab, Neebe and Spies prepared that alibi.
</p>
<p>They were going to let these three other men suffer, let the man that threw
</p>
<p>the bomb surfer ; but they, who had been teaching dynamite for years,
</p>
<p>.asking people to throw bombs for years they, after the bomb had been
</p>
<p>thrown, were going to say that they were not liable at all.
</p>
<p>" Now, at that meeting, Spies got back up here and opened the meeting.
</p>
<p>There was some significance in the very way he opened it. We will have
</p>
<p>it all here. Fortunately, one of the newspaper reporters Mr. English, of
</p>
<p>the Tribune stood there with his overcoat on, with his hands in -his pocket,
</p>
<p>not daring to take his paper out, and took a minute of everything that was
</p>
<p>said wrote in shorthand, with his hand in his pocket, what they said, as
</p>
<p>long as he could. Spies opened the meeting up here near the alley. A
</p>
<p>wagon was standing there upon which they stood and from which they
</p>
<p>spoke. Spies found that the meeting was going to dissolve ; there wasn't
</p>
<p>going to be any interference by the police to any extent unless they could
</p>
<p>ikeep that crowd there. So he sends Balthasar Rau over to the Arbeiter-
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACY AND COWARDICE. 401
</p>
<p>Zeitung office, where the American group were. Now, how did he know that
</p>
<p>they were over there ? They went over to the Arbeit er~ Zeitung office to get
</p>
<p>Parsons, Fielden and the rest of them to come over and address the meet-
</p>
<p>ing, and they came over, and we will have what they said where speeches
</p>
<p>were inflammatory, denunciatory, crying for bloodshed everything of that
</p>
<p>character.
</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, I have called several of these men cowards. The testi-
</p>
<p>mony will show that they are. I am rather inclined to think that Fielden,
</p>
<p>although he is an Anarchist, is the only man in the whole crowd that stood
</p>
<p>his ground that night.
</p>
<p>" The history of the throwing of that bomb shows that the police did not
</p>
<p>interfere any too soon. Gentlemen, it is our humble opinion, from looking
</p>
<p>this case all over, that Inspector Bonfield, although it is sad to think that
</p>
<p>life is destroyed I think Inspector Bonfield did the wisest thing that he
</p>
<p>possibly could have done, to have called the police there that night as he
</p>
<p>did. If he had not, the next night it would have had to be done, or the next,
</p>
<p>and whereas seven poor men are dead, there would have been instead hun-
</p>
<p>dreds, perhaps thousands. I say again, to the credit of Bonfield and the
</p>
<p>police, I wish it understood that at that meeting it was the wisest thing that
</p>
<p>ever happened to this town, although cruel as it may seem in the light of the
</p>
<p>fact that seven died. Hundreds and perhaps thousands were saved.
</p>
<p>Anarchy had been taught and cried for months ; it had almost come with
</p>
<p>its demoralization, and the strength and courage of the police saved the
</p>
<p>town.
</p>
<p>"About ten o'clock, from the reports coming to Bonfield, as will appear
</p>
<p>in proof, the inflammatory utterances of these American citizens, of these
</p>
<p>people, had decided Bonfield that the meeting must be broken up. He was
</p>
<p>wise. He passed down there with his force of police, and, gentlemen, not a
</p>
<p>policeman except the commanding officer in front had a weapon in his hand.
</p>
<p>They marched down there shoulder to shoulder, covering the whole street,
</p>
<p>and came to the wagon. Fielden was shouting to the police, talking about
</p>
<p>the bloodhounds as they advanced, because he was facing them as he spoke.
</p>
<p>He probably saw them as they turned the corner. They formed here
</p>
<p>(indicating On the map), in this court back here, and marched into the

</p>
<p>street at Desplaines, occupying almost the entire width of the street, facing
</p>
<p>down what we may call up Desplaines Street, north towards where this
</p>
<p>meeting was. The meeting was held about the vicinity of that alley. This
</p>
<p>property here, all through there, is Crane's factory R. T. Crane & Co.
</p>
<p>Here is an alley that runs in through here. Eagle Street is here, and of
</p>
<p>course here is Lake, and here is Randolph. Fielden was speaking ; the
</p>
<p>police came up to the wagon ; Captain Ward stepped up to the crowd and
</p>
<p>told them that he commanded them, in the name of the people of the State
</p>
<p>of Illinois, to depart, to leave, to disperse. He made the ordinary statutory
</p>
<p>declaration. Fielden stepped from the wagon and said : 'We are peace-
</p>
<p>able,' so that it could be heard a long distance around him. At that moment
</p>
<p>a man, who a moment before had been on the wagon, stepped to the corner
</p>
<p>of that alley, lighted the bomb and threw it into the police. Fielden stepped
</p>
<p>from the wagon and began firing. He is the only one, I told you, of the
</p>
<p>crowd, that has got any of the elements of the hero in him ; he was willing
</p>
<p>to stand his ground. The others fled. Parsons never did a manly thing
</p>
<p>in his life, and neither did the others. They are not for law ; they are
</p>
<p>against the law. Although Fielden is against the law, he did have the
</p>
<p>4 02 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>English stubbornness to stand up there and shoot, and he fired from over
</p>
<p>the wagon until finally he disappeared.
</p>
<p>" I have given you in detail a good deal of the proof. I have told you
</p>
<p>the reason that I did it was, not only for your own edification, but so that
</p>
<p>these gentlemen could know what we expect to prove. We have nothing
</p>
<p>to conceal, we have nothing to hide. We expect as fair a statement from
</p>
<p>them as to their case.
</p>
<p>"I have only a word or two more to you, gentlemen. Remember,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, that this meeting was called for half-past seven. The police
</p>
<p>did not appear until half-past ten. There are nearly three long hours
</p>
<p>about half-past ten, between ten and half-past ten. The bomb-throwers had
</p>
<p>become discouraged. Those individuals that were situated in different
</p>
<p>parts of the town had not received the communication, because the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy embraced the fact that spies were to be located there to scatter the
</p>
<p>word, and then was to continue this destruction. The police came so late,
</p>
<p>and so many went away, that it was absolutely coming very near to being a
</p>
<p>fiasco. They had been arranging for it for months. The conspiracy had
</p>
<p>been clearly declared and established. The only thing they needed was
</p>
<p>the crowd. The crowd failed to come. The police failed to interfere, and
</p>
<p>finally, at the last moment, having interfered, most of those that were there
</p>
<p>had gone. And there was another thing. These men that were interested
</p>
<p>in the throwing of the bomb were paralyzed, notwithstanding their firing
</p>
<p>and the shooting, by the attitude of the police who stood up there ; and in
</p>
<p>all my examination of these men, asking each and every one of them as far
</p>
<p>as I could what they did there that night, I have failed to find a man that
</p>
<p>ran. They stood up there and fired at these wretches who were pouring into
</p>
<p>them, from both sides of the street, a volley of shots from pistols. One
</p>
<p>bomb was fired and thrown, and just the moment that happened, not a
</p>
<p>policeman with his club scarcely one not a policeman with a pistol in
</p>
<p>his hand, but every one standing there waiting for orders. The bomb was
</p>
<p>thrown, and the firing began from both sides of the policemen and from the
</p>
<p>crowd, and them alone. The police never fired a shot until after many of
</p>
<p>their men had already bit the dust.
</p>
<p>" I will attempt to show to you, gentlemen, who threw the bomb, from

</p>
<p>this locality (indicating on map). I have said to you that the bomb that
</p>
<p>was thrown was made by Lingg. I will prove that.
</p>
<p>" I have one other suggestion to make to you. There never was a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy in the world, either small or great not a conspiracy ever estab-
</p>
<p>lished in the world, but what there was needed some conspirator to give the
</p>
<p>first information of its existence and its purposes. I want you to be cautious,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, about an unjust criticism of any member of that conspiracy
</p>
<p>who first gave us the ideas about it and its ends. Seliger gave us the
</p>
<p>information, the first information, which led to the knowledge of this terrible
</p>
<p>conspiracy, led to the knowledge of the facts relating to it. I said to you, we
</p>
<p>may not use Seliger ; but I say to you this, gentlemen, that not a single
</p>
<p>conspirator placed upon the witness-stand by the State shall be so placed
</p>
<p>there without we can do something to corroborate his statements ; and even
</p>
<p>if we do not, I have yet to learn of a man that dare say that that conspiracy
</p>
<p>did not exist. And so far as that is concerned as a question of law, when a
</p>
<p>conspirator or a co-conspirator gives his testimony in court, you have a right
</p>
<p>to reject it if you desire. But, gentlemen, before you reject it the court
</p>
<p>will simply instruct you in regard to a conspirator's testimony that his tes-
</p>
<p>THE LA W OF ACCESSORY. 403
</p>
<p>timony is to be considered like any other witness, and that you have a right
</p>
<p>to consider his credibility in view of the fact that he is a co-conspirator.
</p>
<p>"This indictment is for murder, a serious charge. Under our statute
</p>
<p>the jury fixes the penalty. If murder, the penalty is not less than fourteen
</p>
<p>years ; it may be for life ; it may be the death penalty. For manslaughter,
</p>
<p>the lower degree under murder, under our statute, which is somewhat dif-
</p>
<p>ferent from statutes in other States, the penalty is any number of years' im-
</p>
<p>prisonment and may be for life. The indictment in this case is for murder.
</p>
<p>There are a great many counts here, but the chief thing is the count against
</p>
<p>these men for murder. Now, it is not necessary in a case of this kind, nor
</p>
<p>in any case of murder, or any other kind, that the individual who commits
</p>
<p>the exact and particular offense for instance, the man who threw the bomb
</p>
<p>should be in court at all. He need not even be indicted. The question for
</p>
<p>you to determine is, having ascertained that a murder was committed, not
</p>
<p>only who did it, but who is responsible for it, who abetted it, assisted it, or
</p>
<p>encouraged it ? There is no question of law in the case.
</p>
<p>" We will show to you, I think to your entire satisfaction, that, although
</p>
<p>perhaps none of these men personally threw that bomb, they each and all
</p>
<p>abetted, encouraged and advised the throwing of it, and therefore are as
</p>
<p>guilty as the individual who in fact threw it. They are accessories.
</p>
<p>" I have talked to you, gentlemen, longer than I expected to, and chiefly
</p>
<p>so that you would know something about this case, know something about
</p>
<p>the facts. I have given you not, perhaps, all the details, but I have given
</p>
<p>you, as a whole, the facts. I want you to patiently listen to the evidence in
</p>
<p>this case from both sides, and be careful in your analysis. You have, most
</p>
<p>of you, been here some time, and you have been admirably patient. Only
</p>
<p>continue that way, and be patient in the matter, and make up your minds
</p>
<p>when the testimony is all presented, and not before. It may take some
</p>
<p>days to get at the proof and to place it all before you, so that you can
</p>
<p>clearly understand it. A great deal of the proof has to come from the
</p>
<p>mouths of witnesses whose language will have to be interpreted to you. That
</p>
<p>will take more time. But the whole case will finally be presented to you
</p>
<p>substantially, I think, as I have stated it. I will now leave the matter

<p>timony An Anarchist's " Squeal" The Murder Conspiracy Made Manifest by Many
</p>
<p>Witnesses.
</p>
<p>ON Friday, July 16, the day following the delivery of the State's Attor-
</p>
<p>ney's argument, the first witness was called. The defendants appeared
</p>
<p>flushed with excitement, and the throng in the court-room was eager in
</p>
<p>expectancy of the State's evidence. Some of the officers disabled at the
</p>
<p>Haymarket were among the interested spectators. All were in a flutter of
</p>
<p>suppressed excitement.
</p>
<p>"Felix D. Buschick," called the State's Attorney.
</p>
<p>The sound re-echoed through the room and floated out through the open
</p>
<p>windows. Buschick advanced with trepidation and took the witness-stand.
</p>
<p>Every neck was craned to catch a glimpse of him as he arose. He was a
</p>
<p>draughtsman, and his testimony had reference simply to maps and plans
</p>
<p>showing the location of the Haymarket Square, the surrounding streets and
</p>
<p>alleys, the spot where the bomb was thrown, and the location of the Des-
</p>
<p>plaines Street Station.
</p>
<p>Inspector JOHN BONFIELD followed next. He stated that he was
</p>
<p>Inspector of Police, had been on the force ten years, and had been in com-
</p>
<p>mand of the men ordered to rendezvous at Desplaines Station on the night
</p>
<p>of May 4. His testimony then proceeded as follows :
</p>
<p>" I got there about six o'clock. There were present Capt. Ward, Lieuts.
</p>
<p>Bowler, Penzen, Stanton, Hubbard, Beard, Steele and Quinn, each in charge
</p>
<p>of a company. During that day our attention was called to a circular calling
</p>
<p>a meeting at the Haymarket that evening. I saw the Mayor that afternoon,
</p>
<p>then went to Desplaines Street Station and took command of the forces
</p>
<p>there, all told about one hundred and eighty men. We stayed in the station
</p>
<p>until between ten and half-past ten. The men then formed on Waldo Place.
</p>
<p>We marched down north on Desplaines Street. Capt. Ward and myself
</p>
<p>were at the head, Lieut. Steele with his company on the right, and Lieut.
</p>
<p>Quinn on the left ; the next two companies that formed in division front,
</p>
<p>double line, were Lieut. Bowler on the right, Stanton on the left ; next com-
</p>
<p>pany in single line was Lieut. Hubbard. Lieuts. Beard and Penzen's orders

</p>
<p>were to stop at Randolph Street and face to the right and left. We marched
</p>
<p>until we came about to the mouth of Crane Brothers' alley. There was a
</p>
<p>truck wagon standing a little north of that alley and against the east side-
</p>
<p>walk of Desplaines Street, from which they were speaking. There were
</p>
<p>orders issued in regard to the arms of the men and officers."
</p>
<p>Being asked what those orders were, defendants' counsel objected, but
</p>
<p>the objection was overruled. Bonfield continued :
</p>
<p>404
</p>
<p>INSPECTOR BONFIELD'S TESTIMONY. 405
</p>
<p>" The orders were, that no man should draw a weapon or fire or strike
</p>
<p>anybody until he received positive orders from his commanding officer.
</p>
<p>Each officer was dressed in full uniform, with his coat buttoned up to the
</p>
<p>throat and his club and belt on, and the club in the holder on the side.
</p>
<p>Capt. Ward and myself had our weapons in our hand ; pistols in pockets.
</p>
<p>As we approached the truck, there was a person speaking from the truck.
</p>
<p>Capt. Ward turned slightly to the right and gave the statutory order to dis-
</p>
<p>perse : 'I command you, in the name of the people of the State of Illinois,
</p>
<p>to immediately and peaceably disperse.' As he repeated that, he said, ' I
</p>
<p>command you and you to assist.' Almost instantly, Mr. Fielden, who was
</p>
<p>speaking, turned so as to face the Captain and myself, stepped off from the
</p>
<p>end of the truck toward the sidewalk and said in a loud tone of voice, ' We
</p>
<p>are peaceable.' Almost instantly after that I heard from behind me a
</p>
<p>hissing sound, followed, in a second or two, by a terrific explosion. In
</p>
<p>coming up the street, part of the crowd ran on Desplaines toward Lake, but
</p>
<p>a great portion fell back to the sidewalks on the right and left, partly lap-
</p>
<p>ping back onto our flanks. Almost instantly after the explosion, firing from
</p>
<p>the front and both sides poured in on us. There were from seventy-five to
</p>
<p>a hundred pistol shots fired before a shot was fired by any officer. There was
</p>
<p>an interval of a few seconds between that and the return fire by the police.
</p>
<p>On hearing the explosion I turned around quickly, saw almost all the men
</p>
<p>of the second two lines shrink to the ground, and gave the order to close
</p>
<p>up. The men immediately re-formed. Lieuts. Steele and Quinn with their
</p>
<p>companies charged down the street ; the others formed and took both sides.
</p>
<p>In a few moments the crowd was scattered in every direction. I gave the
</p>
<p>order to cease firing and went to pick up our wounded. Mathias J. Began
</p>
<p>was almost instantly killed. The wounded, about sixty in number, were
</p>
<p>carried to the Desplaines Street Station. Seven died from the effects of
</p>
<p>wounds."
</p>
<p>After identifying circulars calling the Haymarket meeting and demand-
</p>
<p>ing revenge, he continued :
</p>
<p>" As we approached there were about five or six on the truck. Did not
</p>
<p>see the direction of the bomb ; it came from my rear. I was about ten feet
</p>
<p>from the wagon. The rear rank of the first company and the second com-

</p>
<p>pany suffered the most. During the evening or during the continuance of
</p>
<p>the meeting I received reports as to what was going on, from officers
</p>
<p>detailed for that purpose."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination, his testimony was as follows :
</p>
<p>" I was the highest officer on the ground that night. The whole force
</p>
<p>was under my special charge and direction. As we marched down, the
</p>
<p>divisions of police occupied the full width of the street from curb to curb.
</p>
<p>Around the corner of Desplaines and Randolph there were a few persons
</p>
<p>scattered, apparently paying no attention to the meeting ; the crowd attend-
</p>
<p>ing the speaking was apparently north of that alley. The speakers' wagon
</p>
<p>was not more than five or six feet north of that alley. Fielden, when speak-
</p>
<p>ing, was facing to the north and west, was facing us when my attention
</p>
<p>was especially called to him ; there were about one thousand people there ;
</p>
<p>don't remember whether it was moonlight ; there were no street lamps lit ;
</p>
<p>there was a clear sky. As we marched along, the crowd shifted its position ;
</p>
<p>the speaking went right on. My experience is, if the police were marching
</p>
<p>406 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>in parade, the crowd would get to the sidewalk to look on ; if to disperse a
</p>
<p>crowd or mob, the natural thing would be for them to run away. I saw
</p>
<p>Fielden that night for the first time. As Capt. Ward turned to the wagon
</p>
<p>to give the order to disperse, I saw the men were still advancing, and I
</p>
<p>turned to the left, gave the command to halt, and then came up alongside of
</p>
<p>Capt. Ward. Capt. Ward stood within a few feet of the south end of that
</p>
<p>truck, which stood lengthwise of the sidewalk, the tongue end north. The
</p>
<p>front rank of the first division was near up to the north line of the alley,
</p>
<p>probably not more than ten or fifteen feet from the wagon. Before Capt.
</p>
<p>Ward had finished his command I was beside him. Capt. Ward spoke as
</p>
<p>loud as he could speak. Between my calling the halt and the explosion of
</p>
<p>the bomb, I don't think it was a minute. As the Captain finished, Fielden
</p>
<p>stepped from the truck and faced us, and, stepping on the street, he turned
</p>
<p>to the sidewalk or curb, which is perhaps ten inches above the street, and
</p>
<p>said : ' We are peaceable.' Within two or three seconds the explosion fol-
</p>
<p>lowed. I did not hear anything said by Fielden from the truck. When he
</p>
<p>stepped on the street I could have reached out and touched him. He did
</p>
<p>not say : 'This is a peaceable meeting.' When I heard the hissing sound
</p>
<p>Fielden was in the act of getting to the sidewalk."
</p>
<p>GOTTFRIED WALLER, a former associate of the defendants, testified through
</p>
<p>an interpreter. He stated his occupation, residence, etc., and proceeded as
</p>
<p>follows :
</p>
<p>" On the evening of the 3d of May I was at Greif's Hall, 54 West Lake
</p>
<p>Street ; got there at eight o'clock ; went there pursuant to an advertisement
</p>
<p>in the Arbeiter-Zeitung: ' Y Come Monday night.' Before that notice there
</p>
<p>is the word ' Briefkasten,' which means letter-box. This notice was a sign
</p>
<p>for a meeting of the armed section at Greif's Hall. I had been there once
</p>
<p>before, pursuant to a similar notice. There was no other reason for my
</p>
<p>going there. I had seen no printed document before. I spent no time in
</p>
<p>the saloon at Greif's place. I attended a meeting there in the basement
</p>
<p>which extends throughout the length of the building. The ceiling of base-
</p>
<p>ment is about seven or eight feet above the floor. I called the meeting to
</p>
<p>order at half-past eight. There were about seventy or eighty men. I was
</p>
<p>chairman. I don't know of any precautions taken about who should come

</p>
<p>into the meeting. Of the defendants there were present Engel and Fischer
</p>
<p>none of the other defendants."
</p>
<p>On a question as to what was said at that meeting after it had been
</p>
<p>called to order, objections were raised on behalf of six of the defendants
</p>
<p>other than Engel and Fischer, and overruled. Waller then resumed :
</p>
<p>" First there was some talk about the six men who had been killed at
</p>
<p>McCormick's. There were circulars there headed ' Revenge,' speaking
</p>
<p>about that ; then Mr. Engel stated a resolution of a prior meeting as to
</p>
<p>what should be done, to the effect that if, on account of the eight-hour strike,
</p>
<p>there should be an encounter with the police, we should aid the men against
</p>
<p>them. He stated that the Northwest Side group had resolved that in such
</p>
<p>case we should gather at certain meeting-places, and the word > Ruhe' pub-
</p>
<p>lished in the Letter-box of the Arbeiter-Zeitung should be the signal for us
</p>
<p>to meet. The Northwest Side group should then assemble in Wicker Park,
</p>
<p>armed. A committee should observe the movement in the city, and if a
</p>
<p>INFORMER WALLERS TESTIMONY. 407
</p>
<p>conflict should occur the committee should report, and we should first storm
</p>
<p>the police stations by throwing a bomb and should shoot down everything
</p>
<p>that came out, and whatever came in our way we should strike down. The
</p>
<p>police station on North Avenue was referred to first. Nothing was said
</p>
<p>about the second station just as it happened. I then proposed a meeting
</p>
<p>of workingmen for Tuesday morning on Market Square. Then Fischer
</p>
<p>said that was a mouse trap ; the meeting should be on the Haymarket and
</p>
<p>in the evening, because there would be more workingmen. Then it was
</p>
<p>resolved the meeting should be held at 8 P.M. at the Haymarket; it was
</p>
<p>stated that the purpose of the meeting was to cheer up the workingmen so
</p>
<p>they should be prepared, in case a conflict would happen. Fischer was
</p>
<p>commissioned to call the meeting through handbills ; he went away to order
</p>
<p>them, but came back after half an hour and said the printing establishment
</p>
<p>was closed. It was said that we ourselves should not participate in the
</p>
<p>meeting on the Haymarket ; only a committee should be present at the
</p>
<p>Haymarket and report in case something happened, as stated before.
</p>
<p>Nothing was said as to what should be done in case the police interfered
</p>
<p>with the Haymarket meeting. We discussed about why the police stations
</p>
<p>should be attacked. Several persons said, ' We have seen how the capital-
</p>
<p>ists and the police oppressed the workingmen, and we should commence to
</p>
<p>take the rights in our own hands ; by attacking the stations we would pre-
</p>
<p>vent the police from coming to aid.' The plan stated by Engel was adopted
</p>
<p>by us with the understanding that every group ought to act independently,
</p>
<p>according to the general plan. The persons present were from all the
</p>
<p>groups, from the West, South and North sides."
</p>
<p>A question being raised as to what was said about attacking the police
</p>
<p>in case they should attempt to disperse the Haymarket meeting, he replied :
</p>
<p>" There was nothing said about the Haymarket. There was no one who
</p>
<p>expected that the police would get as far as the Haymarket ; only, if strikers
</p>
<p>were attacked, we should strike down the police, however we best could,
</p>
<p>with bombs or whatever would be at our disposition. The committee
</p>
<p>which was to be sent to the Haymarket was to be composed of one or two
</p>
<p>from each group. They should observe the movement, not only on the
</p>
<p>Haymarket Square, but in the different parts of the city. If a conflict hap-

</p>
<p>pened in the daytime they should cause the publication of the word ' Ruhe.'
</p>
<p>If at night, they should report to the members personally at their homes.
</p>
<p>On the 4th of May we did not understand ourselves why the word ' Ruhe'
</p>
<p>was published. It should be inserted in the paper only if a downright
</p>
<p>revolution had occurred. Fischer first mentioned the word ' Ruhe.' I only
</p>
<p>knew one of the members of the committee, Kraemer. Engel moved that
</p>
<p>the plan be adopted. The motion was seconded, and I put it to a vote.
</p>
<p>" During the discussion was anything said about where dynamite or
</p>
<p>bombs or arms could be obtained, that you remember of?" " Not on that
</p>
<p>evening," answered the witness. " I left the meeting about half-past ten.
</p>
<p>I went home. I was present at the Haymarket meeting on Tuesday even-
</p>
<p>ing for some time. I did not go there on account of the meeting, but
</p>
<p>because I had to go to Zepf's Hall, to a meeting of the Furniture Workers'
</p>
<p>Union. I saw the word 'Ruhe' in the Arbeiter-Zeittmg about 6 P.M., on
</p>
<p>Tuesday, at Thalia Hall, a saloon on Milwaukee Avenue, where the second
</p>
<p>company of the Lehr und Wehr Verein and the Northwest Side group used
</p>
<p>to meet. I went to the Haymarket and stayed there about a quarter of an
</p>
<p>4 o8 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>hour, while Mr. Spies spoke. Mr. Spies spoke English ; I didn't under-
</p>
<p>stand it, and I went to the meeting of the furniture workers. On my way
</p>
<p>to the Haymarket I had stopped at Engel's. There were some people of
</p>
<p>the Northwest Side group there. Engel was not at home. Breitenfeld was
</p>
<p>not there. I was at Zepf's Hall when the bomb exploded. There was
</p>
<p>some disturbance, and the door was closed. After the door was opened
</p>
<p>again we went home. I went alone. On my way home I stopped at
</p>
<p>Engel's and told him what had happened at the Haymarket. They had
</p>
<p>assembled in the back part of their dwelling-place around a jovial glass of
</p>
<p>beer, and I told them that a bomb was thrown at the Haymarket, and that
</p>
<p>about a hundred people had been killed there, and they had better go home.
</p>
<p>Engel said yes, they should go home, and nothing else."
</p>
<p>"Mr. Waller," asked the State, "did you ever have any bombs?"
</p>
<p>This was objected to by the defense, but after a full argument the objec-
</p>
<p>tion was overruled. Waller resumed :
</p>
<p>" Formerly, about half a year ago, I had one. It was made out of an
</p>
<p>eight-inch gas or water pipe. I did not investigate what it was filled with.
</p>
<p>Got it from Fischer, the defendant, on Thanksgiving day of last year, at
</p>
<p>Thalia Hall."
</p>
<p>" What did he say to you, if anything, when he gave it to you ? "
</p>
<p>Another objection was raised, but it was overruled. "Waller continued :
</p>
<p>" I should use it. There were present members of the Northwest Side
</p>
<p>group and several men of the Lehr und Wehr Verein when he gave me
</p>
<p>that bomb."
</p>
<p>Asked as to a public meeting on Thanksgiving day, Waller answered in
</p>
<p>the affirmative, stating that the meeting was held at Market Square. After
</p>
<p>explaining that the members of the Lehr und Wehr Verein were known not
</p>
<p>by names, but by numbers, he said :
</p>
<p>"Everybody had to know his own number; my number was 19. The
</p>
<p>numbers of the different men were not exactly secret, but we did not pay
</p>
<p>particular attention to it. Of those who were present at the meeting at 54
</p>
<p>West Lake Street, on Monday night, I knew Fischer, Engel, Breitenfeld,
</p>
<p>Reinhold Krueger and another Krueger, Gruenwald, Schrade, Weber,
</p>
<p>Huber, Lehman, Hermann."

</p>
<p>"What became of the bomb which you had ? "
</p>
<p>" I gave it to a member of the Lehr und Wehr Verein ; he had it
</p>
<p>exploded in a hollow tree. I had a revolver with me when I went to the
</p>
<p>Haymarket ; had no bomb. Schnaubelt was present at the Lake Street
</p>
<p>meeting. (Witness identified photograph of Schnaubelt.) Schnaubelt at
</p>
<p>that meeting said we should inform our members in other places of the
</p>
<p>revolution so that it should commence in other places also. On Sunday,
</p>
<p>before that meeting at Lake Street, I was present at a meeting at Bohemian
</p>
<p>Hall, at No. 63 Emma Street. August Krueger invited me ; he is also
</p>
<p>called the little Krueger, while Reinhold is known as the large Krueger.
</p>
<p>I got to the meeting at Emma Street at 10 A.M. There were present Engel
</p>
<p>and Fischer, the defendants, besides Gruenwald, the two Kruegers, Schrade,
</p>
<p>myself."

</p>
<p>"The same that I stated Engel's plan. Engel proposed the plan.
</p>
<p>Somebody opposed this plan, as there were too few of us, and it would be
</p>
<p>better if we would place ourselves among the people and fight right in the
</p>
<p>midst of them. There was some opposition to this suggestion to be in the
</p>
<p>midst of the crowd, as we could not know who would be our neighbors ;
</p>
<p>there might be a detective right near us, or some one else. Engel's plan
</p>
<p>was finally accepted."
</p>
<p>An effort was made to have Waller's testimony all stricken out, but the
</p>
<p>motion was overruled. He was subjected to a rigid cross-examination, but
</p>
<p>he did not waver in any of his statements. He proceeded as follows :
</p>
<p>"Before I ceased to be a member of the Lehr und Wehr Verein, I
</p>
<p>belonged to it for four or five months. I learned that the objects of the
</p>
<p>Lehr und Wehr Verein are the physical and intellectual advancement of its
</p>
<p>members. None of the defendants were members of that society about the
</p>
<p>4th of May. I had seen a call by the letter < Y ' in the Arbeiter-Zeitung
</p>
<p>once before, one or one and a half months before. On the 3d of May a
</p>
<p>member of the Lehr und Wehr Verein, by the name of Clermont, called
</p>
<p>for me. I spoke with Engel before I went to Greif's Hall, but had no con-
</p>
<p>versation with him about the purpose of the meeting. We did not know
</p>
<p>for what purpose it was called. When more people arrived, I requested
</p>
<p>Engel to lay his plan again before the meeting. Engel stated both at the
</p>
<p>meeting on Sunday and at the Monday night meeting that the plan pro-
</p>
<p>posed by him was to be followed only if the police should attack us. Any
</p>
<p>time when we should be attacked by the police, we should defend ourselves.
</p>
<p>"Nothing was said with reference to any action to be taken by us at the
</p>
<p>Haymarket. We were not to do anything at the Haymarket Square. The
</p>
<p>plan was, we should not be present there at all. We did not think that the
</p>
<p>police would come to the Haymarket. For this reason no preparations
</p>
<p>were made for meeting any police attack there. When I saw the word
</p>
<p>' Ruhe' in the Arbeiter-Zeitung on Tuesday, May 4, about 6 P.M., I knew
</p>
<p>the meaning, but I didn't know why it was in the paper. On the Hay-
</p>
<p>market, on my way to the meeting of the Furniture Workers' Union, I met
</p>
<p>Fischer. We were walking about some time. I don't think he said any-
</p>
<p>thing to me about why I was not at Wicker Park. We once walked over

<p>to Desplaines Street Station. The police were mounting five or six patrol
</p>
<p>wagons, and I made the remark : ' I suppose they are getting ready to
</p>
<p>drive out to McCormick's, so that they might be out there early in the
</p>
<p>morning.' Fischer assented to my remark. That was all that was said
</p>
<p>about the police between us. At that time there were about three hundred
</p>
<p>and fifty or four hundred people assembled at the Haymarket. The prin-
</p>
<p>cipal purpose of the Haymarket meeting was to protest against the action
</p>
<p>of the police at the riot at McCormick's factory. While I was with Fischer
</p>
<p>at the Haymarket, nothing was said between us about preparations to meet
</p>
<p>an attack by the police. When I came to Engel's, at about half-past ten,
</p>
<p>there were in his house Breitenfeld, the little Krueger, Kraemer, and a few
</p>
<p>others. Kraemer, I think, lived in the rear of the house.
</p>
<p>" I know that I am indicted for conspiracy. I was arrested about two
</p>
<p>weeks after the 4th of May by two detectives, Stift and Whalen, and taken
</p>
<p>to East Chicago Avenue Station. I saw there Capt. Schaack, and, in the
</p>
<p>evening, Mr. Furthmann. I was released about half-past eight of the same

<p>occasion I had conversations with Furthmann about the statements made
</p>

<p>the station, I was paid for it. Once we had to sit all day, and we were paid
</p>
<p>two dollars for that day. I was out on a strike, and Capt. Schaack gave
</p>
<p>my wife three times three dollars. He gave me, twice before, five dollars
</p>
<p>each time. I have been at work for the last two weeks for Peterson. When
</p>
<p>I went there to commence work I was told that I was on the black list, and
</p>
<p>could not work, and Capt. Schaack helped me to get the job. By the black
</p>
<p>list I mean that the bosses put all those upon a list who were in any way
</p>
<p>connected with the strike to obtain eight hours' work, and they were not to
</p>
<p>be employed any further.
</p>
<p>" I know Spies by sight. I never had any conversation with him. I
</p>
<p>spoke to Mr. Neebe once a few words, at a meeting of the basket-makers.
</p>
<p>I have no acquaintance whatever with Schwab, Parsons, Fielden or Lingg.
</p>
<p>I saw Lingg once make a speech."
</p>
<p>BERNHARD SCHRADE, another confidant of the Anarchists, stated that he
</p>
<p>had resided in this country nearly five years and had been a member of the
</p>
<p>Lehr und Wehr Verein. He was present at the meeting in the basement
</p>
<p>of Greif's Hall, on the evening of May 3, and found the meeting in order
</p>
<p>when he got there. His testimony was as follows :
</p>
<p>" Waller was presiding. There were about thirty or thirty-five people
</p>
<p>Waller, Engel, Fischer, Thielen, the Lehmans, Donafeldt. Lingg was
</p>
<p>not there. When I entered, the chairman explained what had been spoken
</p>
<p>about until then. He stated the objects of the meeting ; that so many
</p>
<p>men at the McCormick factory had been shot by the police ; that a mass-
</p>
<p>meeting was to be held at Haymarket Square, and that we should be pre-
</p>
<p>pared, in case the police went beyond their bounds attacked us. After-
</p>
<p>wards we talked among ourselves, and the meeting adjourned. I heard
</p>
<p>nothing about assembling in other parts of the city. That same evening I
</p>
<p>had been to the carpenters' meeting, and it was said there that the mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the L. u. W. V. should go around to the meeting on Lake Street. I

<p>stayed there from eight until half-past nine. Circulars headed ' Revenge '
</p>
<p>were distributed there by one Balthasar Rau. That carpenters' meeting
</p>
<p>was held at Zepf's Hall. At the meeting at 54 West Lake Street I stayed
</p>
<p>from half-past nine until about a quarter after ten. On the preceding Sun-
</p>
<p>day I was at a meeting at the Bohemian Hall, on Emma Street. We got
</p>
<p>there about half-past nine in the forenoon. The big Krueger called for me.
</p>
<p>There were, besides me, Waller, Krueger, Fischer, Engel and Grueneberg.
</p>
<p>I don't know the others.
</p>
<p>" Those present belonged to the second company of the L. u. W. V., and
</p>
<p>the Northwestern group. We talked there about the condition of the
</p>
<p>workingmen after the ist of May, and the remark was made that it might
</p>
<p>not go off so easy after the ist of May, and if it should not, that they would
</p>
<p>help themselves and each other. It was said that if we were to get into a
</p>
<p>conflict with the police, we should mutually assist one another, and the mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the Northwestern group should meet at Wicker Park, in case it
</p>
<p>should get so far that the police would make an attack, and should defend

</p>
<p>themselves as much as possible, as well as anyone could. Nothing was said
</p>
<p>about dynamite ; the word "stuff " was not used. Nothing was said about
</p>
<p>telegraph wires. The revolutionary movement was talked about; it was
</p>
<p>mentioned that the firemen could easily disperse large masses of the people
</p>
<p>standing upon the street, and in such a case it would be the best thing to
</p>
<p>cut through their hose, annihilate them. I was at the Haymarket on the
</p>
<p>night when the bomb was thrown. Went there with a man named Thielen.
</p>
<p>Got there about half-past eight. I walked up and down on Randolph Street,
</p>
<p>and at the corner of Desplaines I heard all the speakers. When the bomb
</p>
<p>was thrown I was at a saloon at 173 West Randolph -Street. I had left the
</p>
<p>meeting because a rain and a shower came up. I know all the defendants.
</p>
<p>I saw Engel and Fischer, about an hour previous to the meeting, upon the
</p>
<p>corner of Desplaines and Randolph. After the bomb was thrown I went
</p>
<p>to my home, 581 Milwaukee Avenue. I met the little Krueger in the
</p>
<p>saloon. He was there ; also the big Krueger. The L. u. W. V. used to
</p>
<p>meet at Thalia Hall, Milwaukee Avenue. We had our exercise, marched
</p>
<p>in the hall drilled. We had Springfield rifles, which we kept at home.
</p>
<p>" We had our military drills for pleasure. Most of the members had been
</p>
<p>soldiers in the old country, and we were drilling here for fun pleasure.
</p>
<p>We drilled once a week, at times. The members knew each other, but on
</p>
<p>the list each one had his number. My number was 32. There were four
</p>
<p>companies of the L. u. W. V. in this city. I dont know the number of
</p>
<p>members.
</p>
<p>" I saw < Revenge ' circulars at the meeting at 54 West Lake Street. I know
</p>
<p>Schnaubelt by sight. Don't remember whether he was at 54 West Lake.
</p>
<p>(Witness was shown the signal " Y, " in Arbeiter-Zeitung.~} I saw this in the
</p>
<p>paper when I read it at Thalia Hall. It is a sign for the armed section to
</p>
<p>meet at 54 West Lake Street. The armed section means certain members
</p>
<p>of certain societies trades-unions who had bought weapons with which
</p>
<p>they practiced continually." (Witness is shown paper containing the word

<p>sold at meetings of workingmen. On cross-examination he testified :
</p>
<p>"I know Spies, Parsons, Fielden, Neebe and Schwab only by sight;
</p>
<p>never had any business or conversation with any of them. Lingg and I
</p>
<p>belonged to the same Carpenters' Union, but we were not on terms of
</p>
<p>friendship. None of the defendants are members of the L. u. W. V., to my
</p>
<p>knowledge. I paid attention to all that was done while I was at the 54
</p>
<p>West Lake Street meeting. I was at the Sunday meeting from half-past
</p>
<p>nine until half-past eleven. The discussion was, that if the police made an
</p>
<p>attack upon workingmen we would help the workingmen to resist it, and if
</p>
<p>the firemen helped, we would cut the hose. Nothing was said abou* dyna-
</p>
<p>mite or bombs at any of the meetings. Nothing was said about a meeting
</p>
<p>at any particular night to throw bombs. It was not agreed to throw bombs
</p>
<p>at the Haymarket meeting. While at the Haymarket I had no bomb ; I
</p>
<p>don't know dynamite. I knew of no one who was going to take a bomb to that
</p>
<p>meeting. When I left the Haymarket meeting everything was quiet ; I did
</p>
<p>not anticipate any trouble. I had seen the signal ' Y ' before. It was under-
</p>
<p>stood that the meetings were to be called by that kind of notice. I left the

</p>
<p>Haymarket meeting only on account of the approach of the storm. There
</p>
<p>were about two hundred people there when I left."
</p>
<p>EDWARD J. STEELE, Lieutenant of Police at the West Chicago Avenue
</p>
<p>Station on May 4th, gave some details as to marching to the Haymarket,
</p>
<p>and stated that he had been in command of a company of twenty-eight
</p>
<p>men. He further testified :
</p>
<p>"Two or three seconds after that Captain Ward's command to the
</p>
<p>meeting to disperse the shell was thrown in the rear. It exploded on the
</p>
<p>left of my company. There was then also a smaller report in the rear of
</p>
<p>me, like a large pistol shot, and at that time the crowd in front of us and
</p>
<p>on the sidewalks fired into us immediately ; by immediately I mean two
</p>
<p>or three seconds after. The crowd fired before the police did. Mine and
</p>
<p>Quinn's were the front companies. My men had their arms in their pockets
</p>
<p>and their clubs in their belts ; their hands by their side. I was six or
</p>
<p>eight feet from the speakers' wagon when the command to halt was given.
</p>
<p>Prior to that I could hear speaking going on in front of us. I heard some-
</p>
<p>body say, ' Here come the bloodhounds. You do your duty and we will do
</p>
<p>ours.' I could not say who made the remark. The sound came from in
</p>
<p>front of us as we were marching. Ward spoke in a loud tone of voice to
</p>
<p>the speakers on the wagon when he commanded them to disperse. There
</p>
<p>were three or four men on the wagon. I saw Mr. Fielden there. I did not
</p>
<p>hear him make any response to Ward's declaration. After the pistol shots
</p>
<p>from the crowd we returned the fire. Fielden stepped off the wagon,
</p>
<p>turned to the sidewalk, and I lost sight of him. When we got some few
</p>
<p>feet north of Randolph Street, the crowd in front of us separated to the
</p>
<p>right and left. I heard nothing said by the crowd. The bomb lit in the
</p>
<p>rear of the left of my company, and the right of Lieut. Quinn's, between
</p>
<p>that and the next company behind us. When I heard the explosion I was
</p>
<p>facing north. The word ' fire ' was not given by anybody, but we began
</p>
<p>firing when they fired on us. The explosion of the bomb affected about
</p>
<p>twenty-one of our men in the two companies, and the firing commenced at
</p>
<p>once."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination, Lieut. Steele stated :
</p>
<p>" My experience is that where the police make a descent upon a riotous

</p>
<p>gathering, a mob, the latter scatter to all sides, so as to get out of the way.
</p>
<p>But when we pass through a peaceful, quiet body of men, they separate
</p>
<p>to the sides instead of rushing down the alleys and out the other way. I
</p>
<p>do not mean to say that the remark about the bloodhounds coming was
</p>
<p>made by the speaker from the wagon. Mr. Fielden was on the sidewalk
</p>
<p>when the bomb exploded. Capt. Ward was just a step or two in front of
</p>
<p>me when he gave the order to disperse. Any loud exclamation made by
</p>
<p>Mr. Fielden, either in the wagon, or getting out of the wagon, or imme-
</p>
<p>diately after he got out, I would have heard. I did not hear him make any."
</p>
<p>MARTIN QUINN, Lieutenant of Police, had a company of twenty-five men
</p>
<p>on the left of Lieut. Steele, and when they marched to the Haymarket they
</p>
<p>had their clubs in their belts and their pistols in their pockets. He heard
</p>
<p>the remark : " Here they come now, the bloodhounds. Do your duty, men,
</p>
<p>414 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>and I'll do mine." The man who was speaking at the time they came up
</p>
<p>was Fielden. Quinn's testimony then runs as follows :
</p>
<p>" Just as he was going down, he said : ' We are peaceable.' Some person
</p>
<p>had hold of his left leg. He reached back, and just as he was going down
</p>
<p>he fired right where the Inspector was, Capt. Ward and Lieut. Steele.
</p>
<p>After that I dropped my club, took my pistol and commenced firing in
</p>
<p>front. The crowd formed a line across the street in our front, and imme-
</p>
<p>diately when that bomb was fired, and almost instantaneously with it that
</p>
<p>shot from the wagon, they commenced firing into our front and from the
</p>
<p>side, and then from the alley. I fired myself. Fourteen men of my com-
</p>
<p>pany were injured. I lost sight of Fielden as he got on the sidewalk. I
</p>
<p>could not distinguish which was first, the explosion of the bomb or the shot
</p>
<p>fired by Fielden. There was another very loud report immediately after
</p>
<p>this first explosion. I did not know what it was. The bomb exploded
</p>
<p>about the same instant that the remark, ' We are peaceable,' was made.
</p>
<p>And at the same time he fired that shot. Ward at that time had not quite
</p>
<p>finished his expression. The pistol was aimed in a downward direction,
</p>
<p>towards where Ward, Steele and Bonfield stood. After I was looking to
</p>
<p>the front, and had discharged my weapon, I looked back and saw the explo-
</p>
<p>sion of the bomb it was just the same as you would take a bunch of fire-
</p>
<p>crackers and throw it around, just shooting up in all directions, in the rear.
</p>
<p>Some of the men were lying down, some of them lying dead, some crippled
</p>
<p>around. All along on Desplaines Street the lamps were dark. Where the
</p>
<p>speaker was there was a torch on the wagon, and also the lamp was lit
</p>
<p>there. I had emptied my pistol. Then I turned around to look at the
</p>
<p>result of the explosion. Then I went over in under the wagon, and where
</p>
<p>the speaker was, and I found a pistol there that was loaded. I picked it up
</p>
<p>and emptied it myself afterwards. It was a thirty-eight Smith & Wesson.
</p>
<p>I saw Fielden fire only that one shot. It was not aimed at the man who
</p>
<p>had hold of his leg. There were Ward, Bonfield and Steele there right in
</p>
<p>a bunch, close by together, and it should have hit some one of them."
</p>
<p>The cross-examination did not change the testimony ; he only added to
</p>
<p>its force, and with reference to Fielden only modified it so far as to say :
</p>
<p>"I would not swear that it was or was not Fielden who fired the pistol,

</p>
<p>but it was a speaker, that I know, that fired at the instant he finished say-
</p>
<p>ing, ' We are peaceable.' While standing in the wagon, in the presence of
</p>
<p>the police force and all the audience, he fired a revolver right where Lieut.
</p>
<p>Steele was and Capt. Ward, and the right of Lieut. Steele's company ; fired
</p>
<p>right into them. The torch was still on the wagon at that -time, and the
</p>
<p>street lamp near by was lighted."
</p>
<p>JAMES P. STANTON, Lieutenant of Police, had charge of eighteen men and
</p>
<p>saw the shell coming through the air. He shouted to his men : " Look out,
</p>
<p>there is a shell," and just then it exploded. It fell just four feet from where
</p>
<p>he stood, and his men were scattered upon the street. All but one or two
</p>
<p>of his command were wounded. He himself was injured, his body being
</p>
<p>hit in eleven different places with pieces of the shell, and he was confined
</p>
<p>to a bed at the hospital for two weeks and a half, after which he was taken
</p>
<p>home.
</p>
<p>SPIES IDEA OF REVOLUTIONS. 415
</p>
<p>" After that I commenced to limp around. I had to suffer from a
</p>
<p>nervous shock. The holes in my clothing are larger than the holes in my
</p>
<p>limbs. My company was on the west side of the street, Bowler on the
</p>
<p>east. When I first saw the shell it was in the air, very near over my head.
</p>
<p>It came from the east, I think, a little north of the alley. It was about
</p>
<p>three inches in diameter. The fuse was about two inches long when I saw
</p>
<p>it. When we advanced I heard speaking from the north. I saw some
</p>
<p>parties standing on the wagon. Don't know anything about what trans-
</p>
<p>pired after the officers came to a halt. No shot was fired to my knowl-
</p>
<p>edge before the explosion of the bomb. Immediately after that shots were
</p>
<p>fired. I turned myself and drew my revolver and immediately commenced
</p>
<p>to fire. I cannot swear from whom the firing began first. My men were
</p>
<p>supposed to be armed ; they had their clubs in their belts."
</p>
<p>, The cross-examination brought out no new points.
</p>
<p>H. F. KRUEGER, a police officer, heard the cry, " Here they are now,
</p>
<p>the bloodhounds ! " from the wagon at the Haymarket, and thought it was
</p>
<p>Fielden who uttered it. "I saw Fielden," said he, "pistol in hand, take
</p>
<p>cover behind the wagon and fire at the police. I returned his fire and was
</p>
<p>myself immediately shot in the knee-cap. I saw Fielden in the crowd and
</p>
<p>shot at him again. He staggered, but did not fall, and I lost him. There
</p>
<p>were no pistol-shots fired before the bomb exploded." This testimony was
</p>
<p>in every detail corroborated by John Wessler, another police officer, the
</p>
<p>next witness, and by Peter Foley, an officer.
</p>
<p>LUTHER MOULTON, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, an officer of the Knights
</p>
<p>of Labor, testified to a conversation which he had had with August Spies
</p>
<p>when the latter went to Grand Rapids to deliver a lecture, on February
</p>
<p>22, 1885. Spies told the witness that the only manner in which the labor-
</p>
<p>ers could get a fair division of the product of their labor was by force and
</p>
<p>arms. He said they had three thousand men organized in Chicago, with
</p>
<p>superior weapons of warfare. There might be bloodshed, Spies said to
</p>
<p>him, for that happened frequently in revolutions. If they failed, it would
</p>
<p>be a punishable crime. If they succeeded, it would be a revolution.
</p>
<p>George Washington would have been punished had he failed. " I am
</p>
<p>quite certain," Moulton said, "that the term 'explosives' was used in con-

</p>
<p>nection with arms." On cross-examination Moulton stated that the Grand
</p>
<p>Rapids police had furnished him the means to come to Chicago. All of
</p>
<p>Moulton's material statements were repeated on the stand by Geo. W.
</p>
<p>Shook, who had been present at the conversation referred to.
</p>
<p>JAMES BOWLER, Lieutenant of Police, in command of twenty-seven men.
</p>
<p>testified that he did not recognize any one firing.
</p>
<p>" After the explosion I said to my men : 'Fire and kill all you can.' I
</p>
<p>drew ray own revolver ; I had it in my breast coat side pocket. In march-
</p>
<p>ing, I heard the words : ' Here come the bloodhounds,' said by somebody
</p>
<p>close to the wagon. I fired nine shots myself. I reloaded. While march-
</p>
<p>416 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>ing, the men had their arms in their pockets. I noticed the lamp at Crane's
</p>
<p>alley was out."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination he stated that he heard the remark about blood-
</p>
<p>hounds, but did not know who uttered it. He continued :
</p>
<p>"There was a kind of lighten the wagon, a kind of a torch. I saw
</p>
<p>firing close by the wagon after the explosion, but not from in the wagon. I
</p>
<p>saw no one either in the wagon or getting out of the wagon do any firing.
</p>
<p>I saw Mr. Fielden coming off of the wagon very plainly."
</p>
<p>Several officers testified to the scene about the wagon, and Thomas
</p>
<p>Greif, the occupant of the premises 54 West Lake Street, described the
</p>
<p>basement where the " Ypsilon " meeting was held. Following him was
</p>
<p>proffered more direct evidence that Fielden had fired the shot, and then
</p>
<p>JAMES BONFIELD took the stand, and described the search that was made in
</p>
<p>the Arbeiter-Zeitung office. Said he :
</p>
<p>"In Mr. Spies' office I found a small piece of fuse, a fulminating cap,
</p>
<p>and a large double-action revolver ; about five inches of fuse. I found the
</p>
<p>revolver under a wash-stand in the office ; that dirk file was along with them
</p>
<p>(indicating), with a paper doubled over them loosely. The fuse is an
</p>
<p>ordinary fuse ; the fulminate is in the end of the cap. The fuse is inserted
</p>
<p>that way (indicating), and the cap is pinched, and that is inserted in dyna-
</p>
<p>mite and the hole closed. I never saw the cap used for anything except
</p>
<p>dynamite and nitro-glycerine. I have used it in mines for that purpose.
</p>
<p>The power of the cap itself don't amount to anything. I found that
</p>
<p>' Revenge ' circular, as it is called, in Spies' office, where I arrested him.
</p>
<p>This box (indicating) contains a great many empty shells, evidently for the
</p>
<p>Winchester improved rifle ; there are also some empty and some loaded
</p>
<p>sporting cartridges. The pistol is a 44-caliber, I think. On the 5th, after
</p>
<p>the arrest of Spies, that night I took down some reporters. I had a con-
</p>
<p>versation with Spies that night, and I think with Fielden. The reporter
</p>
<p>carried on the major part of the conversation. Mr. Spies stated there had
</p>
<p>been a meeting of the Central Labor Union that evening previous to the
</p>
<p>Haymarket meeting. He mentioned a man by the name of Brown, and a
</p>
<p>man by the name of Ducey that attended that meeting, and when they
</p>
<p>adjourned there they went down to the Haymarket. He spoke of the

</p>
<p>gathering of the crowd, how it threatened to rain, how they went on the side
</p>
<p>street, and about Fielden speaking at the time the police came. He said
</p>
<p>he was on the wagon at that time, and a young Turner was there who had
</p>
<p>told him the police were coming, told him to come down, took him by the
</p>
<p>hand and helped him down. He afterwards gave his name as Legner ; he
</p>
<p>claimed the police had opened fire on them. He said when he got off the
</p>
<p>wagon he went in the east alley and came out on Randolph Street. He
</p>
<p>approved of the method, but thought it was a little premature ; that the
</p>
<p>time had hardly arrived to start the revolution or warfare. After that I took
</p>
<p>the reporters around to Fielden.
</p>
<p>" Fielden said he was there when the police came up ; he got wounded
</p>
<p>in this alley. Then he got a car, and, I think, went around to the corner of
</p>
<p>Twelfth and Halsted, or Van Buren and Halsted, and then he got
</p>
<p>another car and went down to the Arbeiter-Zeitung office to see if any of
</p>
<p>his friends had got back there ; that from there he went over to the Hay-
</p>
<p>JAMES BONFIELUS TESTIMONY. 417
</p>
<p>market again to see if any more of his comrades were hurt. I know
</p>
<p>Fischer. I was at his house. He was arrested at the same time, or a few
</p>
<p>minutes after Spies and Schwab were arrested. His house is 170 or 176
</p>
<p>North Wood Street. I went there with Mr. Furthmann and, I think,
</p>
<p>Officer Doane. It was about nine or ten o'clock. I made a search of the
</p>
<p>house. In a closet, under the porch at the front door, I found a piece of
</p>
<p>gas-pipe about three and a half feet long. There was no gas connection in
</p>
<p>the house. The gas-pipe was an inch or an inch and a quarter in diameter.
</p>
<p>I laid it down again. I searched around and went back again, and
</p>
<p>couldn't find it in a day after. I remember a conversation with Fischer
</p>
<p>afterwards, in the office. He was asked to explain how he came by a
</p>
<p>fulminating cap which was found in his pocket at the time of the arrest.
</p>
<p>He said he got it from a Socialist who used to visit Spies' office about
</p>
<p>four months previous. He claimed he didn't know what it was, and
</p>
<p>had carried it in his pocket for four months. After some conversation
</p>
<p>he acknowledged that he knew what it was, and had read an account of it
</p>
<p>and the use of it in Herr Most's ' Science of War.' That conversation was
</p>
<p>at a detective's office. The fulminating cap looked to be perfectly new,
</p>
<p>and the fulminate was fresh and bright in the inside. There was no fuse
</p>
<p>attached to it. He told of being at the Haymarket meeting until a few
</p>
<p>minutes before the explosion of the bomb, and he went from there to Zepf's
</p>
<p>Hall, and was there at the time of the explosion. He acknowledged that
</p>
<p>he had gotten up the circular headed 'Attention, Workingmen,' and that
</p>
<p>it was printed at Wehrer & Klein's. I think their own office was closed, and
</p>
<p>he went over to Wehrer & Klein's and got it printed over there; I think 2,500
</p>
<p>copies 25,000 or 2,500."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination witness testified as follows :
</p>
<p>" I am in the detective branch of the police force. I arrested Spies and
</p>
<p>Schwab in the neighborhood of nine o'clock. I found Spies in the front
</p>
<p>office. He was to the left of the door as I entered. My recollection is, he
</p>
<p>was talking to somebody. Schwab was over to the right, and was sitting
</p>
<p>down. That was on the second floor. I think I went up two flights of
</p>
<p>stairs. There were three or four men in the office besides those two.
</p>
<p>There was no resistance by either of the gentlemen. Had no warrant for

</p>
<p>their arrest. I don't know of any complaint having been made against them
</p>
<p>before any magistrate. While I was talking to Spies and Schwab Spies'
</p>
<p>brother came in. I placed him under arrest too. I took them with me.
</p>
<p>I took them to police headquarters. We went on foot. It was in the back
</p>
<p>part of the room that I found that revolver. The main part of the room
</p>
<p>in which I arrested them was perhaps twelve feet deep, and then there was
</p>
<p>a wing that ran back further. The box I mentioned was on the floor, and
</p>
<p>against the south wall. One could see it readily on entering the room. I
</p>
<p>found that box on my third visit. I don't remember having seen it on my
</p>
<p>first visit. That third visit was some time in the afternoon, perhaps two
</p>
<p>or three o'clock. On my second visit I went over to the printer, to pick
</p>
<p>out the type similar to the one in the ' Revenge ' circular. I went to the
</p>
<p>composing-room. The printer's name is John Conway. That was near
</p>
<p>twelve o'clock. On my fourth visit I took away a lot of red flags and such
</p>
<p>stuff as that. When I made the arrest of Spies and Schwab that
</p>
<p>morning Mrs. Schwab was present. I should think, by the looks of
</p>
<p>things, they were transacting business, or ready for it. When I was in the
</p>
<p>4 i8 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>composing-room there were several men there. I found the red flags
</p>
<p>principally in what they termed the library in that building. It was, I
</p>
<p>think, in the rear part, on the second floor. Twenty or twenty-one com-
</p>
<p>positors of the Arbeiter-Zeitung were arrested during that day. I was not
</p>
<p>present at the time. I found that copy of the ' Revenge ' circular on one of
</p>
<p>the desks in the front room. I was there when the form and the type of
</p>
<p>the circular were found. We had no search warrant at the time any of
</p>
<p>them were taken. I do not know to whom that revolver belongs. I took
</p>
<p>Spies and Schwab into the front room of the Central Station. Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Shea sent out for the key. In the meantime we searched Spies
</p>
<p>and took the personal effects away from him. I took Mr. Spies'
</p>
<p>keys out of his pocket everything I found, little slips of paper
</p>
<p>and the like. I literally went through him. I had no warrant for
</p>
<p>anything of that kind. I took those reporters to see Spies down to the
</p>
<p>cell-house in the basement of the Central Station. The cell-house is very
</p>
<p>near the center of the building, and fronts on the inside court between the
</p>
<p>county and city building. I went down with the reporters about eight or
</p>
<p>nine o'clock. Spies, Schwab and Fielden were in separate cells. Spies
</p>
<p>said the action taken at the Haymarket was premature. It was done by a
</p>
<p>hot-head that could not wait long enough. I cannot use the words. That
</p>
<p>is the sentiment, and perhaps the words. Fielden said the police came up
</p>
<p>there to disperse them, and they had no business to. He claimed that they
</p>
<p>had a right to talk and say what they pleased, under the Constitution,, and
</p>
<p>they should not be interfered with. I don't think it was ever questioned
</p>
<p>whether the meeting was a peaceable and quiet meeting. I don't think that
</p>
<p>he ever claimed that it was either quiet or disorderly. The fulminating cap
</p>
<p>which I found in that box did not look fresh and bright. It looked as though
</p>
<p>it might have lain there a good while. When Chief Ebersold came into the
</p>
<p>office at Central Station he was quite excited, and talked to Spies and
</p>
<p>Schwab in German and made motions, and I got between them, and I told
</p>
<p>him this was not the time or place to act that way. I took the liberty to
</p>
<p>quiet him down a little. He used a word which I understood to compare a
</p>
<p>man to a dog or something lower."

<p>DURING the progress of the trial the court-room was thronged daily.
</p>
<p>The prisoners sat radiantly throughout the whole proceedings as if
</p>
<p>supremely certain of acquittal, and they manifested great pride in the
</p>
<p>boutonnieres which were handed in every morning by admiring friends.
</p>
<p>As the testimony of the State's witnesses proceeded, the defense raised
</p>
<p>innumerable objections to the admission of parts particularly criminative,
</p>
<p>and at times hours were consumed in arguments on the points involved.
</p>
<p>The objections were almost invariably overruled, and exceptions taken.

<p>Having finished the evidence then at hand with reference to the McCormick

<p>WILLIAM WARD, Captain of Police at the Desplaines Street Station, a
</p>
<p>member of the force since 1870, a resident of Chicago for thirty-six years
</p>
<p>and a veteran of the Rebellion, was subjected to a long and interesting
</p>
<p>examination. He first stated the facts with reference to marching to the
</p>
<p>Haymarket and his order to the meeting to disperse, corroborating the tes-
</p>
<p>timony of Inspector Bonfield in every particular, and then concluded as
</p>
<p>follows :
</p>
<p>" As the speaker was getting from the wagon he said, 'We are peaceable.'
</p>
<p>That was this gentleman (indicating Fielden). I heard some utterances of
</p>
<p>the speaker before I addressed him, but could not understand them quite
</p>
<p>a noise there. Our men had their clubs in their belts, pistols in their
</p>
<p>pockets. A few seconds after Fielden said, ' We are peaceable,' I heard the
</p>
<p>explosion in my rear. I turned to look and see, and pistol-firing began
</p>
<p>from the front and both sides of the street by the crowd. I did not recog-
</p>
<p>nize anybody firing. Then the police began firing, and we charged into the
</p>
<p>alley, Crane's alley, and north on Desplaines Street. Seven policemen died
</p>
<p>from the effects of wounds ; one was brought dead into the station Mathias

<p>J. Degan. There were in all killed and wounded sixty-six or sixty-seven -
</p>
<p>about twenty-one or twenty-two out of Desplaines Street Station ; forty-two
</p>
<p>in all out of my precinct. It was only several seconds from the time that
</p>
<p>Fielden said, 'We are peaceable,' and the time the police charged down the
</p>
<p>alley and up Desplaines Street."
</p>
<p>The cross-examination resulted as follows :
</p>
<p>" I had a detail there that night from the Central Police Station under
</p>
<p>command of Lieut. Hubbard. At the time I gave the command to disperse
</p>
<p>419
</p>
<p>4 20 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>I was right close to the rear part of the wagon, close to the outside wheel,
</p>
<p>southwest of the wheel. I could almost touch it ; could have touched it
</p>
<p>with my club. Some of the men carried their pistols in the breast pocket of
</p>
<p>the coat, some the hip pocket. At the time I gave the command, Inspector
</p>
<p>Bonfield stood at my left ; Lieut. Steele was in the rear of me, might have
</p>
<p>been a little to the right. There were four to six persons on the wagon.
</p>
<p>Fielden was standing on the south end of the truck, facing southwest,
</p>
<p>facing me, when I commenced to speak, until I was through. Then he got
</p>
<p>off the truck, on the southeast end of it, on the corner toward the side-
</p>
<p>walk. All I could understand of what Mr. Fielden said was : 'We are peace
</p>
<p>able." I did not see Fielden after that. There was no pistol-firing of any
</p>
<p>kind by anybody before the explosion of the bomb. I was several feet in
</p>
<p>advance of the front rank of the police in marching down, sometimes eight
</p>
<p>or ten feet in advance ; sometimes not so far. The only utterance from any
</p>
<p>source that I can recall that was heard by me, before the bomb exploded,
</p>
<p>was that of Fielden, ' We are peaceable, ' that he spoke to me, or looking right
</p>
<p>at me when he spoke. It was a little louder than ordinary, than if he was
</p>
<p>addressing me. I think the accent was on the last word, ' We are peaceable?
</p>
<p>I don't remember whether I related this utterance of Fielden on the
</p>
<p>occasion of the Coroner's inquest when I testified there. I think Steele's
</p>
<p>line was about on a line with the center of the alley. Quinn's line had
</p>
<p>swung a little further forward. A block and a half south of there, there
</p>
<p>were eight or ten electric lights on the front of the Lyceum Theater, and
</p>
<p>they lit up the street considerably. I don't remember whether there was
</p>
<p>a torch-light or any other light on the truck."
</p>
<p>MICHAEL HAHN, a tailor working on Halsted Street, stated that he was
</p>
<p>at the Haymarket and received an injury in his back, one in his thigh, and
</p>
<p>one in the leg :
</p>
<p>" I went to the hospital that same night. Dr. Newman removed some-
</p>
<p>thing from my person that night ; that is what he said ; he showed it to me.
</p>
<p>It was some kind of a nut. (Witness is handed an ordinary iron-threaded
</p>
<p>nut.) I guess that was about the size. I left the hospital two weeks after.
</p>
<p>I think that is the same nut."

<p>he arrested Fischer :
</p>
<p>"I searched him and found that gun (producing and exhibiting a re-
</p>
<p>volver). It is a 44-caliber ; was loaded when I found it ; self-acting,
</p>
<p>I found this file ground sharp on three edges (producing it), and that belt
</p>
<p>and sheath (producing same). The belt and sheath were buckled on him ;
</p>
<p>the file in the sheath, revolver stuck into the slit in the belt, and he had ten
</p>
<p>cartridges in his pocket. He also had this fulminating cap in his pocket.
</p>
<p>It was brighter when I found it. He said he carried that revolver because
</p>
<p>he carried money, and going home nights to protect himself. I took him
</p>
<p>to the Central Station. He said he had worked at the Arbeiter-Zeitung as
</p>
<p>a compositor for two years. When I arrested him he was coming down the
</p>
<p>stairs. I was going up into the building. I felt this revolver and took him
</p>
<p>back up, and searched him and took these things from him. The belt was
</p>
<p>under his coat. You could not see the pistol and this stuff. I also arrested
</p>
<p>Fielden at his house the same day, May 5th, in the morning, at No. no

</p>
<p>West Polk Street. When I locked him up at the Central Station, he took
</p>
<p>the bandage off his knee and put it on. I asked him where he got it
</p>
<p>dressed. He told me when he got shot he came down the alley and took
</p>
<p>a car and went to, I think he said, Twelfth and Canal Streets had his
</p>
<p>knee dressed there that night."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination, Officer Slayton stated that he met with no resis-
</p>
<p>tance from Fischer or Fielden and that he found no munitions of war at
</p>
<p>the latter's house. He had no warrant, he said, for their arrest.
</p>
<p>THEODORE FRICKE, business superintendent of the Arbeiter-Zeitung, once
</p>
<p>its bookkeeper, testified to Spies' handwriting on the manuscript contain-
</p>
<p>ing the word "Ruhe," and identified several other documents as in Spies'
</p>
<p>handwriting. He continued :
</p>
<p>" The Arbeiter-Zeitung is the property of a corporation. Fischer was a
</p>
<p>stockholder, so was I, so is Spies and Schwab. I was employed by this
</p>
<p>corporation. Parsons is not a stockholder. Neebe belongs to this corpora-
</p>
<p>tion. I have
</p>
<p>known Neebe
</p>
<p>about two

<p>years ; I saw

</p>
<p>met at No. 63 Emma Street. Before that I belonged to the Northwest
</p>
<p>Side group, which met at Thalia Hall, No. 633 Milwaukee Avenue. Hirsch-
</p>
<p>berger was the librarian. I know Fischer ; he belonged to the Northwest
</p>
<p>Side group. Engel belonged to the same. Spies formerly belonged to the
</p>
<p>Northwest Side group, later to the American group. Parsons belonged
</p>
<p>to the American group. Schwab, I guess, to the North Side group, I don't
</p>
<p>know for sure. I don't know about Lingg. I guess Neebe belonged to the
</p>
<p>North Side group. These groups, except the Northwest Side group, had a
</p>
<p>central committee, which met at No. 107 Fifth Avenue. The Northwest
</p>
<p>Side group was not represented. They had strong Anarchistic principles.
</p>
<p>Fielden, I guess, belonged to the American group. This book here
</p>
<p>(Johann Most's book) I saw at the library in the Arbeiter-Zeitung building.
</p>
<p>I have seen that book sold at picnics by Hirschberger, at Socialistic picnics

</p>
<p>were present; sometimes Neebe, sometimes Schwab, maybe Fischer."

<p>Counsel for defendants objected to this line of inquir}', because, as they
</p>
<p>said, it is not shown that any of the defendants knew or participated in the
</p>
<p>selling, or that they had anything to do with, or that they saw the selling.
</p>
<p>This led to some words between court and counsel :
</p>
<p>The Court "If men are teaching the public how to commit murder,
</p>
<p>it is admissible to prove it if it can be proved by items."
</p>
<p>Mr. Black "Well, does your Honor know what this teaches? "
</p>
<p>The Court "I do not know what the contents of the book are. I
</p>
<p>asked what the book was and I was told that it was Herr Host's ' Science
</p>
<p>of Revolutionary Warfare,' and taught the preparing of deadly weapons and
</p>
<p>missiles, and that was accepted by the other side."
</p>
<p>Mr. Black "Does that justify your Honor in the construction that it
</p>
<p>teaches how to commit murder, or of stating that in the presence of the

<p>The Court - ". . . . I inquired what sort of book it was, and it was

<p>" I saw this book sold at a picnic at Ogden's Grove, on Willow Street,
</p>
<p>on the North Side, in July of last year. There were present Spies, Neebe,
</p>
<p>Parsons and Fielden. Also at a picnic at Sheffield, Indiana, last Septem-
</p>
<p>ber, where were present Spies, Neebe, Parsons and, I guess, Fischer."
</p>
<p>Fricke then identified copies of the Alarm, Parsons' paper, the Arbeiter-
</p>
<p>Zeitung, the Fackel, the Sunday edition of that paper, and the Vorbote, its
</p>
<p>weekly edition, of various dates from May ist to May 5th.
</p>
<p>On cross-examination, he testified that he had never seen any of the
</p>
<p>defendants sell Most's books anywhere, not even at the Sheffield, Indiana,
</p>
<p>picnic, where there were 2,000 people, and that all communications to the
</p>
<p>Arbeiter-Zeitung went through the hands of the editor, Spies.
</p>
<p>EDMUND FURTHMANN testified as follows :
</p>
<p>" I am assistant in the State's Attorney's office. I was in the Arbeiter-
</p>
<p>Zeitung office between eleven and twelve o'clock on the 5th of May. All
</p>

</p>
<p>of the Arbeiter-Zeitung, and has been in my possession since then. The
</p>
<p>typesetting-room was full of desks and cases of type, and there were several
</p>
<p>tables covered with stone, and at every case there was a hook containing a
</p>
<p>lot of manuscript, which I took away. I found the doors locked. I found
</p>
<p>some twenty or twenty-five of the ' Revenge' circulars there."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination he said :
</p>
<p>"A locksmith opened the door. We had no search warrant. We also
</p>
<p>carried away two mail-bags from there. We placed all this manuscript
</p>
<p>into them. Mr. Grinnell, the State's Attorney, Officer Haas, Lieut. Kipley
</p>
<p>and myself were in the party."
</p>
<p>EUGENE SEEGER translated a paragraph in the Arbeiter-Zeitung of March

</p>
<p>"'Revolutionary Warfare has arrived, and is to be had through the
</p>
<p>librarian, 107 Fifth Avenue, at the price of 10 cents.'
</p>
<p>" This appears among what I would call, as a newspaper man, editorial

<p>the defendant, boarded with me. On Monday, May 3, I worked for Mr.
</p>
<p>Meyer. Quit work at half-past 4 P.M. In the evening of that day I was at
</p>
<p>Zepf's Hall, at a meeting of the Carpenters' Union. I was recording secre-
</p>
<p>tary of the union. I stayed there until half-past eleven. I was not at the
</p>
<p>meeting at 54 West Lake Street that night. I heard somebody call upon
</p>
<p>us, that all that knew should come to 54 West Lake Street. This here

</p>
<p>(holding paper), ' Y Komme Montag Abend,' means that all the armed
</p>
<p>men should come to the meeting at 54 West Lake Street. The armed men
</p>
<p>were divers ones all the Socialistic organizations. There were several
</p>
<p>organizations in existence which were drilled in the use of arms. After I
</p>
<p>left Zepf's Hall I took a glass of beer in the saloon and then went to 71
</p>
<p>West Lake Street and took another glass of beer. Then I went home with
</p>
<p>several other parties. I saw a copy of the ' Revenge ' circular at Zepf's Hall.
</p>
<p>Balthasar Rau brought it to the meeting about nine o'clock.
</p>
<p>" On Tuesday I did not work at my trade. I got up at half-past seven,
</p>
<p>and after I got up Lingg came. I had previously told him that 1 wanted
</p>
<p>those things removed from my dwelling. He told me to work diligently at
</p>
<p>these bombs, and they would be taken away that day. I took some coffee,
</p>
<p>and after a time I worked at some shells, at some loaded shells. I drilled
</p>
<p>holes through which the bolt went. A shell like this (indicating shell intro-
</p>
<p>duced in evidence). I worked on the shells half an hour. Lingg went to
</p>
<p>the West Side to a meeting. Got back probably after one o'clock. He said :
</p>
<p>' I didn't do much. I ought to have worked more diligently.' I said I hadn't
</p>
<p>any pleasure at the work."
</p>
<p>"What did Lingg reply?"
</p>
<p>" Lingg said, ' Well, we will have to work very diligently this afternoon.'
</p>
<p>During the afternoon I did different work at the shells. In the morning I
</p>
<p>had a conversation about the bolts. He told me he had not enough of
</p>
<p>them. He gave me one and told me to go to Clybourn Avenue and get
</p>
<p>some that he had already spoken to the man about. I got about fifty. I
</p>
<p>worked at the bombs during the whole of the afternoon at different times.
</p>
<p>Hubner, Muntzenberg, Heuman, were helping. I worked in the front
</p>
<p>room, also in Lingg's room and the rear room. Lingg first worked at gas
</p>
<p>or water pipes, such as these (indicating). There were probably thirty or
</p>
<p>forty or fifty bombs made that afternoon. The round bombs had been cast
</p>
<p>once before by Lingg, in the rear room, on my stove, probably six weeks
</p>
<p>previous to the 4th of May. The first bomb I ever saw was in Lingg's
</p>
<p>room. That was still before that. At that time he told me he was going
</p>
<p>to make bombs. I saw dynamite for the first time in Lingg's room, about
</p>
<p>five or six weeks previous to the 4th of May. Lingg said every working-

</p>
<p>man should get some dynamite ; that there should be considerable agita-
</p>
<p>tion ; that every workingman would learn to handle these things. During
</p>
<p>that Tuesday afternoon Lingg said those bombs were going to be good
</p>
<p>fodder for the capitalists and the police, when they came to protect the
</p>
<p>capitalists. Nothing was said about when they wanted the bombs com-
</p>
<p>pleted or ready. I only told him that I wanted those things out of my
</p>
<p>room. There was only a remark that they were to be used that evening,
</p>
<p>but nothing positive as to time. I left the house at half -past eight that
</p>
<p>evening. Hubner was at the house probably from four to six o'clock. I
</p>
<p>did not see what he did. He worked in the front room with Lingg. I was
</p>
<p>in Lingg's room. Muntzenberg was there as long as Hubner. Thielen
</p>
<p>was there half an hour quite that. I did not see what he was doing.
</p>
<p>" The Lehmans were at the house for a little while. I did not see what
</p>
<p>they were doing. They were in the front room. Heuman also worked at
</p>
<p>the bombs. I left the house in the evening with Lingg. We had a little
</p>
<p>trunk with bombs in. The trunk was probably two feet long, one foot high
</p>
<p>and one foot wide. It was covered with coarse linen. There were round
</p>
<p>and pipe bombs in it. They were loaded with dynamite and caps fixed to
</p>
<p>INFORMER SELIGER'S TESTIMONY
</p>
<p>425
</p>
<p>them. I don't know how many there were. The trunk might have weighed
</p>
<p>from thirty to fifty pounds. We pulled a stick, which Lingg had broken,
</p>
<p>through the handle. That is the way we carried the trunk, which was
</p>
<p>taken to Neff's Hall, 58 Clybourn Avenue. On the way to Neff's Hall,
</p>
<p>Muntzenberg met us. He took the package into the building through the
</p>
<p>saloon on the side into the hallway that led to the rear. After the bombs
</p>
<p>were put down into that passageway, there were different ones there, three
</p>
<p>or four, who took bombs out for themselves. I took two pipe bombs my-
</p>
<p>self; carried them in my pocket. We went away from Neff's Hall and left
</p>
<p>the package in that passage. The back of Neff's Hall is known under the
</p>
<p>name of the Communisten-Bude. Different Socialistic and Anarchistic
</p>
<p>organizations met there. The North Side group met there. I heard that
</p>
<p>the Saxon Bund met there. I don't know any others that met there. When
</p>
<p>I left Neff's Hall, Thielen and Gustav Lehman were with me. Later two
</p>
<p>PLAN OF THE SELIGER RESIDENCE, USED IN EVIDENCE.
</p>
<p>large men of the L. u. W. V. came to us. I believe they all had bombs.
</p>
<p>We went on Clybourn Avenue north towards Lincoln Avenue, to the Larra-
</p>
<p>bee Street Station, where we halted. Lingg and myself halted there. I
</p>
<p>don't know what had become of the others. Some went ahead of us.
</p>
<p>Lingg and I had a conversation, that there should be made a disturbance
</p>
<p>everywhere on the North Side to keep the police from going over to the
</p>
<p>West Side. In front of the Larrabee Street Station Lingg said it might be
</p>
<p>a beautiful thing if we would walk over and throw one or two bombs into
</p>
<p>the station. There were two policemen sitting in front of the station, and
</p>
<p>Lingg said if the others came out these two couldn't do much. We would
</p>
<p>shoot these two down. Then we went further north to Lincoln Avenue and
</p>
<p>Larrabee Street, where we took a glass of beer. Webster Avenue Station is
</p>
<p>near there. After we left the saloon we went a few blocks north, then
</p>
<p>turned about and came back to North Avenue and Larrabee Street. While
</p>
<p>we stood there a patrol wagon passed. We were standing south of North

</p>
<p>Avenue and Larrabee Street. Lingg said that he was going to throw a
</p>
<p>426 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>bomb that was the best opportunity to throw the bomb and I said it
</p>
<p>would not have any purpose. Then he became quite wild, excited ; said
</p>
<p>I should give him a light. I was smoking a cigar, and I jumped into a
</p>
<p>front opening before a store and lighted a match, as if I intended to light
</p>
<p>a cigar, so I could not give him a light. When I had lighted my cigar the
</p>
<p>patrol wagon was just passing. Lingg said he was going to go after the
</p>
<p>wagon to see what had happened, saying that something had certainly hap-
</p>
<p>pened on the West Side some trouble. The patrol wagon was com-
</p>
<p>pletely manned, going south on Larrabee Street. We were four or five
</p>
<p>houses distant from the station. Then I went into a boarding-house be-
</p>
<p>tween Mohawk and Larrabee Streets and lighted a cigar ; then we went
</p>
<p>towards home. First Lingg wanted to wait until the patrol wagon would
</p>
<p>come back, but I importuned him to go home with me. We got home
</p>
<p>probably shortly before eleven ; I cannot tell exactly. On the way home
</p>
<p>Lingg asked me whether I had seen a notice that a meeting of the armed
</p>
<p>men should be held on the West Side. I said I had seen nothing. Lingg
</p>
<p>wanted to go out. I took the Arbeiter-Zeitung; tore it into two parts. He
</p>
<p>took one, and I one. Thereupon he said, ' Here it is,' and called my atten-
</p>
<p>tion to the word ' Ruhe.' This here is the same that I saw in my house.
</p>
<p>I did not know the meaning of the word ' Ruhe ' until the time I saw it.
</p>
<p>Lingg said there was to have been a meeting on the West Side that night,
</p>
<p>and he was going to go at once to it. ' Ruhe ' meant that everything was
</p>
<p>to go topsy-turvy; that there was to be trouble. He said that a meeting
</p>
<p>had been held at which it was determined that the word ' Ruhe ' should
</p>
<p>go into the paper, when all armed men should appear at 54 West Lake
</p>
<p>Street ; that there should be trouble. After that talk we went away.
</p>
<p>Lingg wanted to go to the West Side, and I talked with him to go with me
</p>
<p>to 58 Clybourn Avenue. Lingg and I went there. There were several
</p>
<p>persons present at Neff's Hall. I did not speak with Lingg at Neff's
</p>
<p>Hall. A certain Hermann said to him, in an energetic tone of voice, 'You
</p>
<p>are the fault of it all.' I did not hear what Lingg said to that. They
</p>
<p>spoke in a subdued tone. Somebody said a bomb had fallen, which had
</p>
<p>killed many and wounded many. I did not hear what Lingg said to that.
</p>
<p>On the way home Lingg said that he was even now scolded, chided for the

</p>
<p>work he had done. He got home shortly after twelve. We laid the bombs
</p>
<p>off on our way on Sigel Street, between Sedgwick and Hurlbut, under an
</p>
<p>elevated sidewalk. I laid two pipe bombs there. I saw Lingg put some
</p>
<p>bombs there. I don't know what kind. The next morning I got up about
</p>
<p>six o'clock. I don't know when Lingg got up. On Wednesday evening,
</p>
<p>when Lingg got home, we spoke about the Haymarket meeting. He said
</p>
<p>if the workingmen only had had the advantage of it they would have
</p>
<p>gained the victory. Then we went together to a meeting on Fifth Avenue,
</p>
<p>at Seamen's Hall.
</p>
<p>' On Friday, I believe, before that Tuesday, the 4th of May, Lingg
</p>
<p>brought some dynamite to the house in a wooden box about three feet in
</p>
<p>length, about sixteen to eighteen inches in height, and about the same
</p>
<p>width. Inside this box there was another box. The dynamite with which
</p>
<p>we filled the bombs on Tuesday was in that large wooden box. We
</p>
<p>handled the dynamite with our hands and with a flat piece of wood which
</p>
<p>Lingg had made for more convenience. This here (indicating) is the pan
</p>
<p>to cast those shells in. (Same offered in evidence.) Lingg used to cast
</p>
<p>shells in them. Lingg once told me he had made eighty to one hundred
</p>
<p>INFORMER SELIGER'S TESTIMONY. 427
</p>
<p>bombs in all. The bolts which I got on that Tuesday were something like
</p>
<p>this (referring to bolt about two and one-half inches long).
</p>
<p>" I am a member of the North Side group of the International Working-
</p>
<p>men's Association. During the last year I was financial secretary. My
</p>
<p>number was, at last, 72. Two years ago the members began to be given
</p>
<p>numbers. I heard Engel make a speech to the North Side group last
</p>
<p>winter at Neff's Hall. He said that every one could manufacture those
</p>
<p>bombs for themselves ; that these pipes could be found everywhere with-
</p>
<p>out cost ; that they were to be closed up with wooden plugs fore and aft,
</p>
<p>and that in one of the plugs was to be drilled a hole for the fuse and cap.
</p>
<p>He said they were the best means against the police and capitalists. I
</p>
<p>never heard him make any other speech.
</p>
<p>" I saw two bombs at the Arbeiter-Zeitung last year at the time of the
</p>
<p>car-drivers' strike. Rau showed them to some one. I don't know precisely
</p>
<p>who were present. Spies was there. It was in the evening. There was
</p>
<p>one round bomb and one long one not very long. I was at the Arbeiter-
</p>
<p>Zeitung as a delegate from the North Side group to the meeting of the
</p>
<p>general committee of all the groups of Chicago.
</p>
<p>"I know Schwab and Neebe. They were members of the North Side
</p>
<p>group of the Internationale. I know Fischer. He is a member of some
</p>
<p>group, but I don't know positively. Lingg belonged to the North Side
</p>
<p>group. Engel belonged to a group, I cannot tell to which one. The North
</p>
<p>Side group met every Monday evening. There were speeches made, or a
</p>
<p>review of what had happened during the week. On Sundays some members
</p>
<p>exercised with rifles. I don't know how many members had rifles. Every
</p>
<p>one took his own rifle home with him. I had a rifle. I kept it at my dwell-
</p>
<p>ing. This book here (Herr Most's book) I saw at public meetings of the
</p>
<p>North Side group. Hubner had charge of them latterly. The North Side
</p>
<p>group bought them and sold them. Hubner was the librarian. This here
</p>
<p>(indicating photograph) is Rudolph Schnaubelt."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination he gave the following testimony :
</p>
<p>"I was arrested after the 4th of May. I was kept at the Chicago Avenue
</p>
<p>Station. The first time fully a week. Then I was on the West Side three
</p>
<p>weeks and one day ; then I went back to the station of my own accord and

</p>
<p>stayed there voluntarily. Was locked up there ever since. When first
</p>
<p>arrested I made a statement, but not of all that I have testified to-day. I
</p>
<p>made a full statement of all that I testified to here, at the Chicago Avenue
</p>
<p>Station. Capt. Schaack, Mr. Furthmann and some detectives were present.
</p>
<p>That was after I had been in prison seven days. The day after and the
</p>
<p>second day after. I have made statements in writing, signed by me, three
</p>
<p>times. In the first statement I had not said much. I have done no work,
</p>
<p>earned no money, during the time I have been in jail. I received money
</p>
<p>from Capt. Schaack; once a dollar and a half, at another time five dollars.
</p>
<p>While I was at liberty I read in the paper that I was indicted for the murder
</p>
<p>of Degan. I did not know before this case was begun that I was not to be
</p>
<p>tried. I did not know whether I was going to be tried for the murder of
</p>
<p>Degan along with Mr. Spies and the other defendants. When the trial was
</p>
<p>commenced I did not inquire of any of the officers why I was not brought
</p>
<p>out for trial. I did not know I was to be used as a witness instead of being
</p>
<p>a defendant at this trial. Capt. Schaack did not tell me anything about my
</p>
<p>trial. If I would come in and tell the story which was in the written state-
</p>
<p>428 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>ment that I have signed he only told me that it would be the best if I
</p>
<p>would tell the truth, and asked me whether I would tell the truth before the
</p>
<p>court, and I said yes."
</p>
<p>Seliger was then given a breathing-spell, and Mr. Buschick was recalled.
</p>
<p>Buschick testified with regard to a map of the rear building of No. 442
</p>
<p>Sedgwick Street, and was excused.
</p>
<p>Seliger, continuing on cross-examination, said :
</p>
<p>" Lingg, I think, is twenty-one or twenty-two years old. He is not a man
</p>
<p>of family. He has boarded with me since Christmas last. My house where
</p>
<p>I lived on May 4th is about three-quarters of a mile distant from the Hay-
</p>
<p>market. When Lingg and I, on Tuesday night at eleven o'clock, after we
</p>
<p>had seen the word ' Ruhe ' in the paper, spoke about going over to the West
</p>
<p>Side, we meant Zepf's Hall, or Greif's Hall, or Florus' Hall. One of those
</p>
<p>halls was certainly meant, for there is no other place. It was not under-
</p>
<p>stood or agreed between me and any other men who had the bombs that
</p>
<p>night at Clybourn Avenue, that any one of us was to go to the Haymarket
</p>
<p>meeting. I know that Capt. Schaack paid my wife money at different
</p>
<p>times since my arrest. I don't know how much. I think $20 or $25.
</p>
<p>Lingg had made the same remark about bombs being the best food for
</p>
<p>capitalists and police before that Tuesday afternoon. When he brought
</p>
<p>the first bomb into the house he said they were to be applied on occasions
</p>
<p>of strikes, and where there were meetings of workingmen and were disturbed
</p>
<p>by the police. On that Tuesday afternoon we agreed to go to Clybourn
</p>
<p>Avenue that night, before the bombs were done. It was said that the
</p>
<p>bombs were to be taken to Clybourn Avenue that evening. I don't believe
</p>
<p>it was agreed that the bombs were to be taken anywhere else than
</p>
<p>Clybourn Avenue. When they were taken to Clybourn Avenue, I don't
</p>
<p>know whether they were to remain there, or were to be taken to further
</p>
<p>places. There was no agx'eement as to where the bombs should be taken
</p>
<p>after they got to Clybourn Avenue. I did not hear anything about an
</p>
<p>agreement that any of the bombs manufactured on the afternoon of May 4th
</p>
<p>were to be taken by anybody to the Haymarket ; we were not making
</p>
<p>bombs to take to the Haymarket and destroy the police. They were to be
</p>
<p>taken to Clybourn Avenue for use on that evening. I can not say that one

</p>
<p>single bomb was made for use at the Haymarket meeting. They were
</p>
<p>made everywhere to be used against capitalists and the police. I cannot
</p>
<p>say who had the bomb at the Haymarket on the night of May 4th. I don't
</p>
<p>know anybody who was expected to be at the Haymarket. I became ac-
</p>
<p>quainted with Lingg in August of last year. I saw Engel once last year in
</p>
<p>the office of the Arbeiter-Zeitung, and again at the meeting of the North
</p>
<p>Side group. I did not see whether the bombs which I saw last summer at
</p>
<p>the Arbeiter-Zeitung building were loaded. The room where I saw them
</p>
<p>was the library-room that belonged to the International Workingmen's
</p>
<p>Association. The bombs were below the counter. I never saw any bombs
</p>
<p>in the office of the Arbeiter-Zeitung, neither in the editorial room nor the
</p>
<p>printing-room, nor in the office of the Arbeiter-Zeitung. The office is the
</p>
<p>front room. This library-room is in the rear. I saw those bombs in the
</p>
<p>rear room. I don't know precisely whether that library-room is a part of
</p>
<p>the office, or whether it is rented as a library-room. I believe that it
</p>
<p>belonged to the Arbeiter-Zeitting. Those drills on Sunday, of which I spoke,
</p>
<p>MRS. SELIGER'S EVIDENCE. 429
</p>
<p>were in the day-time. We kept our guns at home, in broad day-light, and
</p>
<p>in the presence of our neighbors, or any one who might be on the streets,
</p>
<p>walked to the hall on Sunday and drilled. We had a shooting society,
</p>
<p>We went to the Sharpshooters' Park or to the prairie to exercise. We
</p>
<p>used to meet and march publicly on the streets with our guns exposed. We
</p>
<p>didn't try to keep it away from the police force that we had arms and
</p>
<p>drilled and marched. I knew that I was indicted for conspiracy and for
</p>
<p>murder. I did not employ the services of any lawyer. The only lawyers
</p>
<p>that I talked with were Mr. Grinnell and Mr. Furthmann."
</p>
<p>On redirect examination witness stated :
</p>
<p>" During the time I was at liberty I went to the West Side to the house
</p>
<p>of Mr. Gloom, on Twenty-second Street. I stayed with him two weeks
</p>
<p>and one day. He is not a Socialist. I went there from fear of revenge by
</p>
<p>the Socialists."
</p>
<p>MRS. BERTHA SELIGER testified as follows :
</p>
<p>" I have lived in this country two years. Am the wife of William Seliger.
</p>
<p>We lived at 442 Sedgwick Street from the i2th of October to the igth of
</p>
<p>May. I have known Louis Lingg since two weeks before Christmas. He
</p>
<p>came to us to board with us. He boarded with us until May. He took his
</p>
<p>meals with us and slept in the house. We occupied the middle floor of
</p>
<p>that house. His room was next to the front room, and there was a door
</p>
<p>opening into a clothes closet. Shortly before May ist I saw some bombs
</p>
<p>as Lingg was about to hide them about half a dozen lying on the bed.
</p>
<p>They were round bombs and long ones. After Lingg had left the house I
</p>
<p>did not see any more of them ; they were all gone. On the Tuesday on
</p>
<p>which the bomb was thrown at the Haymarket there were several men at
</p>
<p>our house. About six or eight. Perhaps more. Those I knew were
</p>
<p>Hubner, Heuman, Thielen, Lingg and my husband. I think they were
</p>
<p>there until past seven o'clock. They were going and coming during most
</p>
<p>of the afternoon. They were in the front room and in Lingg's room,
</p>
<p>working at bombs. I saw Heuman working and filling at them. What the
</p>
<p>others were doing I don't know. I was in the kitchen, and when supper
</p>
<p>was ready I went into the bed-room. I was so mad I could have thrown
</p>
<p>them all out. I frequently saw Lingg make bombs. I always saw him

<p>cast. I did not pay any particular attention. I simply saw him melt lead
</p>
<p>on the cooking-stove in my house twice with Heuman, once with my
</p>
<p>husband and Thielen, and frequently he worked by himself. He said to
</p>
<p>us: < Don't act so foolishly. You might do something too.' On Monday,
</p>
<p>the day before the bomb was thrown, Lingg was away. In the morning
</p>
<p>some young fellows had come and had their names entered on the list of
</p>
<p>the union, and then he was writing pretty much all day.
</p>
<p>" On Wednesday, the day after the bomb was thrown, Lingg was at
</p>
<p>home in the forenoon. That was the day on which he wanted to hide those
</p>
<p>bombs in the clothes closet, and Lehman was with him. I heard some
</p>
<p>knocking, and I went in, and I said to him : ' Mr. Lingg, what are you
</p>
<p>doing there? I will not surfer that,' and he was tearing everything
</p>
<p>loose below, and he sent that man Lehman after wall-paper, and he
</p>
<p>wanted to cover up everything afterwards nail up everything afterwards.
</p>
<p>He had the wall-paper already there, and he said to me : 'I suppose you
</p>
<p>are crazy. You ought to have said before you wouldn't suffer that, that I
</p>
<p>430 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>would have looked for a place where I am allowed to do that.' He was
</p>
<p>tearing up things all around about in the closet, and he had loosened the
</p>
<p>baseboards and taken out the mortar. He said if he needed something he
</p>
<p>couldn't first go to the West Side to get it. On the Friday following, on
</p>
<p>the yth of May, he left my house. Lingg had a trunk which he kept in his
</p>
<p>bed-room. This instrument (referring to ladle identified by William Seliger)
</p>
<p>Lingg was always casting with."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination Mrs. Seliger stated :
</p>
<p>"I have been locked up on account of this bomb business on account
</p>
<p>of Lingg by Capt. Schaack. The first time I was there from Saturday to
</p>
<p>Tuesday. Of course it was Lingg's fault that I got locked up. I talked
</p>
<p>with Capt. Schaack about this matter several times. I was locked up
</p>
<p>twice. Capt. Schaack paid my rent. I made no memoranda of the
</p>
<p>money I received from Capt. Schaack. He gave me money at different
</p>
<p>times, from the time I made my statement down to the present time. He
</p>
<p>paid my rent and gave me so much money with which to live. When I
</p>
<p>said to Lingg that I wouldn't allow that wall-paper to be put into the
</p>
<p>closet, and 'what would the landlord say when he comes,' Lingg said,
</p>
<p>'Well, then, I will say to him that I will not dirty my clothes.' Those
</p>
<p>boards were about a foot high from the floor. The closet did not reach up
</p>
<p>as far as the ceiling. He intended to put those things in the wall. There
</p>
<p>was nothing in at that time. I stopped him at that juncture. I don't like
</p>
<p>Mr. Lingg very well, because he always had wrong things in his head. I
</p>
<p>blame him for me and my husband having been locked up. My husband
</p>
<p>and myself talked this thing over together. I said to my husband, ' I
</p>
<p>will tell the truth, and you tell it also.' Capt. Schaack told us we had
</p>
<p>better tell it. I am forty years old.
</p>
<p>" I was locked up in the Larrabee Street Station, and my husband was
</p>
<p>in the Chicago Avenue Station. I never occupied the same cell with my
</p>
<p>husband while under arrest. I only heard after I came out again that my
</p>
<p>husband was arrested in another station. While I was arrested I didn't
</p>
<p>see my husband. No one came to see me. I told that story, and then they
</p>
<p>turned me out. When arrested the second time they kept me from Mon-
</p>
<p>day until Friday. I made the same statement as at first and signed it, and

</p>
<p>then they turned me out again. The second time I was arrested they
</p>
<p>brought a statement, which they said my husband had made, and asked
</p>
<p>me to sign it, and I put my name below that of my husband's, and then
</p>
<p>they turned me out. My husband was a Socialist before he got acquainted
</p>
<p>with Lingg."
</p>
<p>MARSHALL H. WILLIAMSON, reporter for the Daily News, witnessed the
</p>
<p>procession of the Socialists in 1885 at the time of the opening of the Board
</p>
<p>of Trade building, and was also present at No. 107 Fifth Avenue, from
</p>
<p>which place they started, and where they finally separated. He heard
</p>
<p>Parsons and Fielden speak from the windows of the Arbeiter-Zeitung office.
</p>
<p>Said the witness :
</p>
<p>" Parsons spoke of the police interfering with them in marching on the
</p>
<p>Board of Trade that night. He called the police bloodhounds and called
</p>
<p>on the mob to follow him in an assault on Marshall Field's dry goods house
</p>
<p>and various clothing-houses, and take from there what he called the neces-
</p>
<p>REPORTER WILLIAMSON'S TESTIMONY. 431
</p>
<p>sities of life. They spoke from the second floor. There were about 1,000
</p>
<p>people in front of the building. Fielden in his speech also called upon the
</p>
<p>mob to follow them, and he agreed to lead them to rob these places or go
</p>
<p>into them and take from them what they needed in the way of clothing and
</p>
<p>dry goods. They both said that the new Board of Trade was built out of
</p>
<p>money of which they had been robbed ; that all the men who transacted
</p>
<p>business there were robbers and thieves, and that they ought to be killed.
</p>
<p>Nothing was said in the speeches as to the means or mode of killing. Later
</p>
<p>I went up-stairs. I saw Fielden and Parsons and some others whose names
</p>
<p>I didn't know. I didn't know Spies at that time, but remember of seeing him
</p>
<p>there. I asked Parsons why they didn't march upon the Board of Trade
</p>
<p>and blow it up. He said because the police had interfered, and they had
</p>
<p>not expected that and were not prepared for them. I told him I had seen
</p>
<p>revolvers exhibited by some in the procession. He told me when they met
</p>
<p>the police they would be prepared with bombs and dynamite. Mr. Fielden
</p>
<p>was standing at his elbow at the time. He said the next time the police
</p>
<p>attempted to interfere with them, they would be prepared for them. That
</p>
<p>would be in the course of a year or so. Spies was in the room. It was the
</p>
<p>front room of the Arbeiter-Zeitung office. Spies was not standing immedi-
</p>
<p>ately with the party. I was shown what they told me was a dynamite cart-
</p>
<p>ridge. The package was about six or seven inches long, and an inch and a
</p>
<p>half or two inches in diameter. It was wrapped in a piece of paper. The
</p>
<p>paper was broken. After I had conversed with Mr. Parsons a while, he
</p>
<p>took out of the broken place a small portion of the contents. It was of a
</p>
<p>slightly reddish color, and he again said it was dynamite, and that was what
</p>
<p>they would use when they went against the police ; he also said he had
</p>
<p>enough of that where he could put his hands on it to blow up the business
</p>
<p>center of the city. I was shown a coil of fuse about fifteen or twenty feet ;
</p>
<p>also a fulminating cap by which they said dynamite bombs were exploded.
</p>
<p>The cap was exploded in the room while I was there. It made quite a
</p>
<p>noise and filled the room with smoke. It was copper and about an inch
</p>
<p>long and perhaps one-eighth of an inch in diameter about the size of a No.
</p>
<p>22 cartridge cap. Mr. Parsons called for these articles. They were in a
</p>
<p>drawer in a desk, and Mr. Spies handed them to him to be shown to me.

</p>
<p>Parsons told me they were preparing for a fight for their rights ; that they
</p>
<p>believed they were being robbed every day by capitalists and the thieving
</p>
<p>Board of Trade men. He said it must stop. He told me that they had
</p>
<p>bombs, dynamite and plenty of rifles and revolvers, and he said their man-
</p>
<p>ner of warfare would be to throw their bombs from the tops of houses and
</p>
<p>stores, and in that way they could annihilate any force of militia or police
</p>
<p>brought against them without any harm to themselves. After this conver-
</p>
<p>sation I went down-stairs, where I met Detectives Trehorn and Sullivan. I
</p>
<p>was acquainted with them. I took them up-stairs and renewed the conver-
</p>
<p>sation with Mr. Parsons, and left him talking with the police officers. The
</p>
<p>conversation I had had with Mr. Parsons was in effect repeated with the
</p>
<p>police officers in my presence. The officers were in citizens' clothes. The
</p>
<p>red flags in that procession were carried by some women. I was at 54 West
</p>
<p>Lake Street, in some of the halls there, on several occasions, within a year
</p>
<p>before the opening of the Board of Trade. That is where I got acquainted
</p>
<p>with Parsons and Fielden. I heard them speak there. That was during
</p>
<p>the winter months of 1884 and 1885. Mr. Fielden, on one occasion, wanted
</p>
<p>them to follow him to those clothing stores and grocery stores and some
</p>
<p>432 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>other places and get what they needed to support their families. He told
</p>
<p>them to purchase dynamite. He said that five cents' worth of dynamite
</p>
<p>carried around in the vest pocket would do more good than all the revolvers
</p>
<p>and pistols in the world. Mr. Parsons also told them they were being
</p>
<p>robbed, and offered to lead them to the grocery stores and other places to
</p>
<p>get what they wanted. That is all I remember of those speeches. I heard
</p>
<p>them some eight or ten times. There were never over between ten and
</p>
<p>twenty-five people present."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination witness stated :
</p>
<p>"The first of these meetings I attended was about two years ago. I wrote
</p>
<p>reports of those meetings, which I think were published in the Daily News
</p>
<p>in each instance the day following, in the morning edition. The circulation
</p>
<p>of the Daily News, about a year and a half and two years ago, was, I think,
</p>
<p>121,000 per day, as claimed by the paper.
</p>
<p>" When I went to the meetings at 54 West Lake Street I had no trouble
</p>
<p>to get in. The meetings were held in the front rooms on the top floor.
</p>
<p>There were no guards at the door. I simply went in and sat down and took
</p>
<p>my notes publicly. Fielden and Parsons learned very soon that I was a
</p>
<p>reporter on the Daily News. Those speeches of Parsons and Fielden which
</p>
<p>I related were made at the first meeting I attended. When Fielden sug-
</p>
<p>gested the five cents' worth of dynamite carried in the vest pocket, he gave
</p>
<p>no instructions whatever on the subject of how to carry or use it. The pro-
</p>
<p>posal to go out to Marshall Field's and some clothing store was a proposal
</p>
<p>for immediate action. He did not start, however. After he got through
</p>
<p>with his talk and proposal, he sat down until the meeting was over. The
</p>
<p>meeting quietly dispersed and went home. I did not see that army of less
</p>
<p>than twenty-five men start for Field's that night, or upon any subsequent
</p>
<p>occasion. I heard that same proposal at every single meeting I attended
</p>
<p>at 54 West Lake Street and 700 and something West Indiana Street, and
</p>
<p>various other places. I do not think there was ever over twenty-five present
</p>
<p>at their meetings in halls. I have seen larger numbers of people at open-
</p>
<p>air meetings. Sometimes the attendance did not exceed about ten men.
</p>
<p>The same proposition was made when there were only ten persons present.
</p>
<p>" In that procession on the night of the opening of the Board of Trade I

</p>
<p>marched at the head. After Mr. Parsons had finished his speech from the
</p>
<p>window of the Arbeiter-Zeitung office that night, in which he proposed to
</p>
<p>lead the multitude against those stores, he quietly went back into the room,
</p>
<p>and I entered into a conversation with him. Mr. Fielden, after he had got
</p>
<p>through proposing, joined in the conversation with Mr. Parsons and myself.
</p>
<p>He didn't go down to the street and lead anybody anywhere, either. The
</p>
<p>proposals that night, both by Fielden and Parsons, were proposals for im-
</p>
<p>mediate action, but they simply proposed to, and then gracefully retired
</p>
<p>from the window. There were about twenty people in the room. Among
</p>
<p>them, I think, was Mr. Spies. There were two reporters besides myself
</p>
<p>there. I think both Fielden and Parsons knew me as a reporter at the time.
</p>
<p>I presume they knew I was connected with the Daily News. Parsons never
</p>
<p>manifested any reluctance in detailing to me what he did ; but in one con-
</p>
<p>versation he refused to reveal the remainder of their plans. I saw some
</p>
<p>three or four revolvers in that procession. I don't know who had them.
</p>
<p>There were not to exceed five hundred people in the procession. I saw two
</p>
<p>revolvers in the right-hand side coat pocket, and two more in the hip pocket,
</p>
<p>LIEUT. SHEA'S TESTIMONY. 433
</p>
<p>carried by four persons. I have informed various police officers of what I
</p>
<p>have seen and heard regarding these people. I had frequent conversations
</p>
<p>with police officers of Chicago. I think there were about four women in
</p>
<p>that procession carrying banners. There were about half a dozen women
</p>
<p>in the room while they spoke from the windows. I think some women
</p>
<p>spoke from' the same windows to the same mob. I think the meetings
</p>
<p>which I attended were regularly advertised in the Daily News."
</p>
<p>On redirect examination, Williamson was asked by the State's Attorney :
</p>
<p>" You were about to say something about some interview that you had with
</p>
<p>Parsons in regard to the plans, also in regard to leaders and privates in
</p>
<p>their army. Will you please state what that was ? "
</p>
<p>" Parsons told me there were some 3,000 armed Socialists in the city of
</p>
<p>Chicago, well armed with rifles and revolvers, and would have dynamite
</p>
<p>and bombs when they got ready to use them ; that they were meeting and
</p>
<p>drilling at various halls in the city. He refused to give me a list of those
</p>
<p>halls. He refused to tell me where they bought rifles. He said the society
</p>
<p>was divided into groups, and that they knew each other by twos and threes.
</p>
<p>He showed me an article in the Alarm, I think, about street warfare. In
</p>
<p>that connection I think he told me it was their intention to occupy the Mar-
</p>
<p>ket Place and the Washington Street tunnel, and in that position they could
</p>
<p>successfully encounter any force that could be brought against them."
</p>
<p>On re-cross-examination witness related :
</p>
<p>"There was nobody present when I had that conversation with Mr.
</p>
<p>Parsons. I think it was after New Year's day of 1885, in the winter. I did
</p>
<p>not ask him how they managed to drill if they only knew each other by
</p>
<p>twos and threes. He said that in that organization of 3,000 no man knew
</p>
<p>more than two or three others."
</p>
<p>JOHN SHEA, Lieutenant of Police, and at the head of the detective force,
</p>
<p>testified about the search of the Arbeiter-Zeitung office and proceeded :
</p>
<p>" I know a man that is called Rudolph Schnaubelt. He was in the sta-
</p>
<p>tion a couple of days after the arrest of those other gentlemen. This here
</p>
<p>(indicating photograph) I recognize as Schnaubelt's picture. When I saw
</p>
<p>him he had a mustache. I had a conversation with Mr. Spies at police
</p>
<p>headquarters, in my office, after he was arrested. We had a conversation

</p>
<p>about that manuscript referred to by me. I asked Spies if he was at the
</p>
<p>meeting at the Haymarket. He said he was ; that he opened the meet-
</p>
<p>ing ; that Schwab was there, but that he understood he went to Deering.
</p>
<p>He said Parsons was there, and Fielden ; that both spoke there Fielden
</p>
<p>at the time the police came. He said he spoke at a meeting on May 3, near
</p>
<p>McCormick's factory, and some of the parties there in the rear had com-
</p>
<p>menced to halloa, and said, 'Let's go to McCormick's,' and they had
</p>
<p>started, and most of the crowd had started with them. Spies .said he had
</p>
<p>heard later what had happened at McCormick's ; that he had got on a street
</p>
<p>car and come down town. I asked him if he knew anything about that cir-
</p>
<p>cular that was circulated on the street. I don't remember that I had pres-
</p>
<p>ent with me the circular which I referred to during that conversation. He
</p>
<p>said he did not know anything about the circular, but heard that it had been
</p>
<p>circulated. I asked him if he wrote this manuscript (indicating manuscript
</p>
<p>434 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>previously produced). Mr. Grinnell was sitting in the office at the time.
</p>
<p>Spies said, ' I refuse to answer.' Then Mr. Spies said he was the editor there.
</p>
<p>I said, ' Now, would not anything of that kind be likely to go through your
</p>
<p>hands before it would go to print ? ' He said, ' I refuse to answer.'
</p>
<p>" I had a conversation with Fischer the next day. He said that on the night
</p>
<p>of May 4 he and several others, Schwab, Fielden, were at a meeting in the
</p>
<p>Arbeiter-Zeitung office ; that Rau brought word to the meeting that there
</p>
<p>was a large crowd at the Haymarket, that Spies was there and very few
</p>
<p>speakers; and they immediately started to the Haymarket. He said he
</p>
<p>didn't hear Spies, but heard Fielden and Parsons. That pistol and dagger
</p>
<p>he had had to protect himself. He had not had it with him that night. It
</p>
<p>was in the Arbeiter-Zeitiing office. On Wednesday morning he had put it
</p>
<p>on because he didn't intend to stay. He was going away. ' That fulminat-
</p>
<p>ing cap he had got from a man in front of the Arbeiter-Zeitung office some
</p>
<p>three months before that. He had never paid any attention to it. He had
</p>
<p>made the sharpened dagger himself for his own protection.
</p>
<p>"In the conversation with Spies, my recollection is that he said he got
</p>
<p>on the wagon, and said something to Parsons or Fielden about its going to
</p>
<p>rain, and left the wagon. I don't recollect where he said he went to.
</p>
<p>Fischer said he was at Zepf's Hall at the time of the explosion."
</p>
<p>FRED. L. BUCK was called to testify with reference to some experiments
</p>
<p>he had made with dynamite which he had received from the detectives'
</p>
<p>office. He had gone to the lake front with Officer McKeough and another
</p>
<p>officer and a newspaper reporter and there made several tests, all of which
</p>
<p>demonstrated the immense force of the dynamite.
</p>
<p>Lieut. GEORGE W. HUBBARD, now Superintendent of the force, had
</p>
<p>charge of the company that composed the third division at the Haymarket.
</p>
<p>Being a large company, it was divided into two, he himself commanding
</p>
<p>one wing and Sergt. (now Capt.) Fitzpatrick, who was drill master, being
</p>
<p>in command of the other.
</p>
<p>" I was about four feet behind Stanton's and Bowler's companies. My
</p>
<p>company was about six feet behind me. I could hear the sound of the
</p>
<p>voices at the wagon, but couldn't hear exactly what was said. I saw the
</p>
<p>bomb when it was about six feet from the ground a little tail of fire

</p>
<p>quivering as it fell not more than six feet in front of me. The bomb im-
</p>
<p>mediately exploded, and as far as I could see the entire division in front of
</p>
<p>me disappeared, except the two ends ; but a great many of them got up
</p>
<p>again in a kind of disorder, and then I flanked the left of the division.
</p>
<p>There was no firing before the explosion of that bomb. The firing began
</p>
<p>almost immediately on both sides of the street and north of me. I, being
</p>
<p>on the left, rushed my division of the company right around toward the
</p>
<p>sidewalk, and commenced answering the charge from that quarter, and
</p>
<p>Fitzpatrick went the other way, to the east, and he commenced shooting
</p>
<p>right into the crowd on the sidewalk, faced them right and left. In our com-
</p>
<p>pany we had our regular revolvers in our pockets, and we had a larger
</p>
<p>revolver in the sockets attached to our belts, on the outside. The club in
</p>
<p>the socket and the revolver in the socket were both hanging to the left side
</p>
<p>of each officer. Pistols and clubs were all in the pockets until the explosion
</p>
<p>of the bomb."
</p>
<p>THE LAKE FRONT MEETINGS. 435
</p>
<p>S. J. WERNEKE, police officer, who was hit with a bullet in the head at
</p>
<p>the Haymarket, testified that he heard Engel at 703 Milwaukee Avenue in
</p>
<p>February, 1886, "advise every man in the audience to join them, and urged
</p>
<p>the people to save up three or four dollars to buy a revolver that was good
</p>
<p>enough to shoot these policemen down. I was at the Haymarket in Lieut.
</p>
<p>Steele's company. Got hit with a bullet in the head."
</p>
<p>JOHN J. RYAN next took the witness-stand. He testified :
</p>
<p>" I am a retired officer of the United States navy. Live at 274 North
</p>
<p>Clark Street. Lived in Chicago for three years. Have seen the defendants
</p>
<p>Spies, Neebe, Parsons, Fielden and Schwab on the occasion of their Sun-
</p>
<p>day afternoon meetings during the summer of last year and the year
</p>
<p>previous. I heard some of them speak there, namely, Spies, Parsons and
</p>
<p>Fielden, in the English language. I can only designate particularly two
</p>
<p>meetings, one previous to the picnic they had last year, and one on the
</p>
<p>Sunday directly after it. That was in July of last year, I think. I cannot
</p>
<p>say that I saw Mr. Spies at either of those meetings. Mr. Parsons I re-
</p>
<p>member at one of them."
</p>
<p>" State what he said," put in the State's Attorney.
</p>
<p>"He was speaking in a general way," said the witness, "about trouble
</p>
<p>with the workingmen and the people, what he called the proletariat class,
</p>
<p>and spoke about their enemies, the police and the constituted authorities ;
</p>
<p>that the authorities would use the police and militia and they would have
</p>
<p>to use force against them. He advised them to purchase rifles. If they
</p>
<p>had not money enough for that, then to buy pistols, and if they couldn't
</p>
<p>buy pistols they could buy sufficient dynamite for twenty-five cents to blow
</p>
<p>up a building the size of the Pullman building?"
</p>
<p>" What, if anything, did you hear Fielden say at that meeting ? "
</p>
<p>" The speeches were very nearly alike ; they spoke about dynamite and
</p>
<p>fire-arms to be used against the police, and any one who opposed them in
</p>
<p>their designs ; they wanted things their way and to regulate society. The

<p>speeches were alike Sunday after Sunday. I heard Spies speak on the lake
</p>
<p>front before and after the meetings I mention ; he represented, as he said,
</p>
<p>the oppressed class, the workingmen, as opposed to the capitalists and
</p>
<p>property-owners ; the latter were the enemy of the workingmen ; if they

<p>couldn't get their rights in a peaceable manner they must get them in a
</p>
<p>forcible way. I heard that talk about ten or fifteen times ; the meetings
</p>
<p>were held there every Sunday until late in the fall. After the picnic, Mr.
</p>
<p>Parsons, I think I won't be sure of that spoke about the young German
</p>
<p>experimenting with dynamite at this picnic ; that this young German had a
</p>
<p>small quantity of dynamite in a tomato-can ; it was thrown into a pond or
</p>
<p>lake, and he spoke of the force this amount of dynamite exerted, and what
</p>
<p>could be done with it*in destroying buildings and property in the city."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination Mr. Ryan stated :
</p>
<p>" Those lake front meetings were held publicly in plain view to every-
</p>
<p>body in every instance. The largest number of persons I ever saw attend one
</p>
<p>of these meetings was not more than 150. The meetings that I attended
</p>
<p>usually lasted two or three hours. I heard two or three other persons speak
</p>
<p>on the lake front at those meetings Mr. Henry, Mrs. Parsons, Mrs. Holmes,
</p>
<p>436
</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>and, one Sunday, a young Englishman whose name I did not hear ; also an
</p>
<p>Irishman whose name I never heard. The meetings were held about half
</p>
<p>past two. The speeches were made in a loud, clear tone, sometimes very
</p>
<p>loud when they would get excited. A policeman who evidently had charge of
</p>
<p>the park was usually around there. It was a general propagation of ideas
</p>
<p>and doctrines, down there on the lake front. Once I heard Mr. Parsons say
</p>
<p>that now was the time to do it. I heard the opinion expressed there that
</p>
<p>the workingmen would have to secure their rights by force, and therefore
</p>
<p>should be prepared for it."
</p>
<p>HARRY WILKINSON, a reporter for the Daily News, testified as follows :
</p>
<p>"On Thanksgiving Day, last year, I heard Mr. Parsons speak on the
</p>
<p>Market Square. He advised the workingmen who were present (there were
</p>
<p>several hundred there), to stand together, and to use force in procuring
</p>
<p>their rights. He told them that they were slaves ; that out of a certain sum
</p>
<p>of money the per cent, they got was too small ; it ought to be more evenly
</p>
<p>divided with the man who employed them. I don't
</p>
<p>recollect that he said at that time anything as to the
</p>
<p>means or manner of force to be used, or against whom.
</p>
<p>"Last January I had several conversations with
</p>
<p>Mr. Spies, probably half a dozen. I first saw Mr.
</p>
<p>Spies a few days after the ist of January of this year
</p>
<p>in regard to the matter published in this paper (in-
</p>
<p>dicating copy of Chicago Daily Neivs of January 13,
</p>
<p>1886). 1 wrote up the result of my talk with Mr. Spies
</p>
<p>for that paper; it was not all published. I inquired
</p>
<p>of Spies about an explosive which had been placed on
</p>
<p>Judge Lambert Tree's steps, and one that was placed
</p>
<p>in the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad offices,
</p>
<p>and he emphatically denied that those machines were
</p>
<p>n ge either made or placed by Socialists or Anarchists,
</p>
<p>2. Package left c. B. & Q. and proved it by showing me that they were entirely
</p>
<p>different in character to those used by the Socialists.
</p>
<p>He showed me this bomb (indicating), which he described as the Czar ; I

</p>
<p>took it with me. He spoke of the wonderful destructive power of the Czar
</p>
<p>bomb ; said it was the same kind that had been used by Nihilists in destroying
</p>
<p>the Czar. I told him that I thought it was a pretty tall story, and he became
</p>
<p>somewhat excited and produced this, and said that there were others, larger
</p>
<p>than that, run by mechanical power clock-work bombs and he gave me
</p>
<p>that in a small room adjoining the counting-room office of the Arbeiter-
</p>
<p>Zeitung. He denied that those things were made at the Arbeiter-Zeitung
</p>
<p>office ; he said they were made by other persons and that there were several
</p>
<p>thousand of them in Chicago distributed, and that at some times they were
</p>
<p>distributed through the Arbeiter-Zeitung office ; that those who could make
</p>
<p>bombs made more than they could use, and those that could make them
</p>
<p>gave them to those that could not; that that one was one of the samples. I
</p>
<p>asked Mr. Spies if I could take that (the bomb) and show it to Mr. Stone,
</p>
<p>and I took it over there and didn't bring it back. On another occasion,
</p>
<p>Mr. Spies and Mr. Gruenhut and myself went to dinner together, and he
</p>
<p>told us there about the organization of their people in a rather boastful
</p>
<p>manner ; how they had gone out on excursions on nice summer mornings,
</p>
<p>some miles out of the city, and practiced throwing these bombs ; the man-

</p>
<p>ner of exploding them ; that they had demonstrated that bombs made of
</p>
<p>compound metal were much better than the other kind, and that a fuse
</p>
<p>bomb with a detonating cap inside was by far the best ; and how at one
</p>
<p>attempt made in his presence one of their machines had been exploded in
</p>
<p>the midst of a little grove, and that it had entirely demolished the scenery ;
</p>
<p>blown down four or five trees. He further described to me some very
</p>
<p>tali and very strong men, who could throw a large-size bomb weighing five
</p>
<p>pounds, fifty paces ; and stated how, in case of a conflict with the police or
</p>
<p>militia, when the latter would come marching up a street, they would be
</p>
<p>received by the throwers formed in the shape of the letter V in the mouth
</p>
<p>of the street just crossing the intersection, illustrating this by taking some
</p>
<p>little toothpicks out
</p>
<p>of a vase on the
</p>
<p>table, laying them
</p>
<p>down and making a
</p>
<p>street intersection.
</p>
<p>He stated the militia
</p>
<p>would probably not
</p>
<p>stay to see a second
</p>
<p>or a third bomb go
</p>
<p>off. If the conflict
</p>
<p>should occur at any
</p>
<p>of the principal street
</p>
<p>intersections in the
</p>
<p>city, some of those
</p>
<p>organized men
</p>
<p>would be on the
</p>
<p>tops of houses ready
</p>
<p>to throw bo nibs
</p>
<p>overboard among
</p>
<p>the advancing troops
</p>
<p>or police. All these

<p>vestigated ; the men
</p>
<p>were all thoroughly
</p>
<p>trained and organ-
</p>
<p>ized. The means of
</p>
<p>access to the house-
</p>
<p>tops of street inter-
</p>
<p>sections was a mat-
</p>
<p>ter of common in-
</p>
<p>formation among
</p>
<p>their adherents. He ascription gfven by August Spi*
</p>
<p>said they had no leaders ; one was instructed as well as another, and when
</p>
<p>the great day came each one would know his duty and do it. I tried to find
</p>
<p>out when this would probably occur, and he did not fix the date precisely
</p>
<p>or approximately at that time. At another of those interviews he said it
</p>
<p>would probably occur in the first conflict between the police and the strikers ;
</p>
<p>that if there would be a universal strike for this eight-hour system there
</p>
<p>would probably be a conflict of some sort brought about in some way
</p>
<p>between the First and Second Regiment of the Illinois National Guards
</p>
<p>and the police, and the dynamite upon the other hand. In trying to get at

</p>
<p>O
</p>
<p>the probable number of them, I understood him that there were probably
</p>
<p>eight or ten thousand.
</p>
<p>" He spoke of other larger bombs, as large as a cigar-box, to be exploded
</p>
<p>by electricity, which would be placed under a street in case they decided, to
</p>
<p>barricade any section of the city, that they had experimented with. That
</p>
<p>certain members of the organization had in their possession a complete
</p>
<p>detail, maps and plans of the underground system of the city. That these
</p>
<p>machines would either destroy everybody that was above them when they
</p>
<p>went off, or so tear up the street as to make it impassable. He told me
</p>
<p>that the ordinary dynamite of commerce was about a 60 or 66 per cent,
</p>
<p>dynamite ; that they made a finer quality by importing infusorial earth
</p>
<p>and mixing it themselves ; that was about a 90 per cent, quality. He
</p>
<p>showed me no dynamite. I don't think he gave me any information about
</p>
<p>Herr Host's ' Science of Revolutionary Warfare.' I understood that the
</p>
<p>object of all this was the bettering of the workingmen's condition by the
</p>
<p>demolition of their oppressors. He vaguely spoke of a list of prominent
</p>
<p>citizens who might suddenly be blown up
</p>
<p>one at a time or all at once. I frequently
</p>
<p>said that I didn't believe much in the story
</p>
<p>he told me. He simply uttered the renewed
</p>
<p>declarations.
</p>
<p>" I had this conversation with Spies in
</p>
<p>the Ar better- Zeitung at his own desk, on the
</p>
<p>left-hand side as you entered the door in the
</p>
<p>editorial room. Mr. Schwab was there once
</p>
<p>or twice when I was in. I was not ac-
</p>
<p>quainted with him personally. The conver-
</p>
<p>sations which I have chiefly detailed here
</p>
<p>took place in the Chicago Oyster House and
</p>
<p>in a little room detached from the counting-
</p>
<p>room down-stairs where he kept those specimen bombs. He got this bomb
</p>
<p>from one of those little pigeonholes in that room.

</p>
<p>" He particularly mentioned the Market Square, and that it would take a
</p>
<p>very few men to fortify that street against all the police and militia in
</p>
<p>Chicago, and that they would have the tunnel at their back for a convenient
</p>
<p>place of retreat for those who were not engaged in throwing the shells, or
</p>
<p>for women and children whom they might care to take there. They were
</p>
<p>to receive the police or militia with their line formed in the shape of a letter
</p>
<p>V, the open end of the letter V facing toward the street intersection.
</p>
<p>Then there were to be others to reinforce them, as it were, on the tops of
</p>
<p>houses, at those corners. The plan here in this copy of the Daily News of
</p>
<p>January i4th, I drew from one that he made right on the table cloth as we
</p>
<p>sat at dinner together, except that he did not put in these little squares, but
</p>
<p>explained to me where these would be, and laid toothpicks to make these
</p>
<p>lines. Those dotted lines and the other dotted lines are to represent the
</p>
<p>dynamiters on tops of houses."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination Mr. Wilkinson testified :
</p>
<p>" I got leave of Mr. Spies to carry the bomb off and show it to Mr.
</p>
<p>Stone. I am now twenty-six years old. Have been in the newspaper busi-
</p>
<p>ness about four years. I came to Chicago in September of last year. I
</p>
<p>was assigned to this work with Mr. Spies by Mr. Stone personally. I

</p>
<p>As published in Daily News, Jan. 14, I

<p>GUST A V LEHMAN ON THE STAND. 439
</p>
<p>advised Mr. Spies of that fact. The circulation of the Daily News, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to its official statistics, was about 165,000. After that conversation in
</p>
<p>the presence of Joe Gruenhut, I had also an interview with Gruenhut. Mr.
</p>
<p>Gruenhut said that the conflict to which our conversation referred at the
</p>
<p>table would occur probably on the ist of May, or within a few days there-
</p>
<p>after, and that it might extend all over the country. He spoke of the
</p>
<p>conflict between the workingmen who were to strike for eight hours and
</p>
<p>their natural enemies, the police and militia. I don't remember that any-
</p>
<p>thing was said about the capitalists. The Haymarket was not mentioned.
</p>
<p>" I did not take any notes while the conversation with Mr. Spies was
</p>
<p>going on. I wrote them up the first opportunity I afterwards had. Spies
</p>
<p>said, as near as I could calculate, that they had about 9,000 bombs. As
</p>
<p>to those tall men who could throw a five-pound bomb fifty paces, my recol-
</p>
<p>lection is that it was a company referred to, without number. There were
</p>
<p>four or five only of that company, as I understood, who could throw a five-
</p>
<p>pound bomb that is a large-sized shell and fifty yards is along distance
</p>
<p>to throw a shell. He described the character of the organizations ; that if
</p>
<p>there were three the first would know the second and the second the third,
</p>
<p>but not the third the first ; that it was Nihilistic in its character, and that
</p>
<p>they were known by other means than names. I don't think I asked Spies
</p>
<p>about how many men were interested in this project that were drilling and
</p>
<p>getting ready. I don't recollect his saying anything about that, but I con-
</p>
<p>cluded that there were as many men as there were bombs, or more. There
</p>
<p>was some delay of about three or four days in the publication of my article
</p>
<p>after it was prepared.
</p>
<p>" I did not believe all Spies said. I believed about half of it. The
</p>
<p>article written by me is wound up by the suggestion that when dressed to
</p>
<p>cold facts it was like a scare-crow flapping in the corn-field. I did not write
</p>
<p>that. That was edited by some one who told me he didn't believe as much
</p>
<p>of the matter as I did. I remember a communication from Mr. Spies in the
</p>
<p>Daily News, after this article. I think I helped 'fix it up,' put a head-line
</p>
<p>on it. The original was then used as copy. I never saw it afterwards. Joe
</p>
<p>Gruenhut is a Socialist."

<p>" I am a carpenter On May 4th I lived at 41 Freeman Street. I lived
</p>
<p>there six months. Have been in this country and in this city four years. I
</p>
<p>was born in Prussia. I attended a meeting at 54 West Lake Street on the
</p>
<p>evening of May 3d. Got there a quarter of nine. I went there from my
</p>
<p>home by myself. I was about to go to a carpenters' meeting at Zepf's Hall,
</p>
<p>but I met several persons who were going to 54 West Lake Street. I saw
</p>
<p>a copy of the Arbeiter-Zeitung containing the notice 'Y Komme Montag
</p>
<p>Abend.' It meant that the armed ones should attend the meeting at 54
</p>
<p>West Lake Street. When I got there the meeting was in session. Some-
</p>
<p>body made a motion to post somebody at the door, and then I went out to
</p>
<p>the sidewalk, by the door, that no one who was going to the water-closet
</p>
<p>could remain there and listen. I was stationed on the sidewalk, where the
</p>
<p>steps were leading down, maybe a good half hour. I went into the meet-
</p>
<p>ing twice. I heard that large man, with the blonde mustache, say he was
</p>
<p>going to have handbills printed and distributed. There were present at the
</p>
<p>meeting Seliger, Thieien, myself, my brother, Fischer, Breitenfeld and the
</p>
<p>Hermanns. That is about all I remember. I don't know how Engel looks.

<p>there

<p>" I cannot tell whether Lingg was in the basement, but he went home
</p>
<p>with me. We had a little quarrel. Lingg came up to us from behind, on
</p>
<p>the sidewalk, and said to us, 'You are all oxen, fools.' I asked him what had
</p>
<p>taken place at the meeting, where we were just coming from. Lingg told
</p>
<p>me that if I wanted to know something I should come to 58 Clybourn Ave-
</p>
<p>nue the next evening. There were present Seliger, my brother, and one
</p>
<p>other man. The next day I worked on Sedgwick Street. After I quit work, at
</p>
<p>three o'clock, I
</p>
<p>met a gentleman,
</p>
<p>Schneideke, and
</p>
<p>we went to
</p>
<p>Lingg's. Got
</p>
<p>there about five
</p>

<p>name I don't

<p>I stayed
</p>
<p>about ten
</p>
<p>minutes. They

<p>cause my coun-

<p>After I left I went

<p>about s eve n

<p>o'clock I went

<p>back to Lingg's,
</p>
<p>and stayed there
</p>
<p>perhaps ten min-

<p>utes. They were
</p>
<p>still busy in the bed-room. Hubner was cutting a fuse, or a coil of
</p>
<p>fuse, into pieces. I saw something like that fuse (indicating a coil of fuse)
</p>
<p>and caps. I didn't do anything there. . They were making these fuse and
</p>
<p>caps in the front room. That afternoon Lingg gave me a small hand
</p>
<p>satchel, with a tin box in it, and three round bombs, and two coils of fuse
</p>
<p>and some caps. This here (indicating) is the box which he gave me. It
</p>
<p>was said that dynamite was in it. It was nearly full. This box of caps

</p>
<p>me to keep these things so that no one could find them. I took them home
</p>
<p>with me, to the wood-shed .; got up at three o'clock that night and carried
</p>
<p>them away to the prairie, about Clybourn Avenue, behind Ogden's Grove.
</p>
<p>"After supper on that Tuesday evening I was about to go to Uhlich's
</p>
<p>Hall, but there was no carpenters' meeting there. Then I was about to go
</p>
<p>home, but we went to 58 Clybourn Avenue, Neff's Hall, because of what
</p>
<p>Lingg had told us Monday night. Schneideke was with me. We stayed
</p>
<p>at Neff's Hall about ten minutes. We got there about half past nine. I
</p>
<p>did not see anybody there whom I knew but the barkeeper. After leaving
</p>
<p>Neff's Hall we went up Clybourn Avenue to Larrabee Street. We had no
</p>
<p>special place in view. I got home about eleven o'clock. We met Seliger and
</p>
<p>Lingg standing together on the sidewalk on Larrabee Street, near Clybourn
</p>
<p>Avenue. We stood there with them, but one -I don't know whether it
</p>
<p>was Seliger or Lingg remarked: 'We four should not keep together.''
</p>
<p>Then we went towards North Avenue, along Larrabee Street. Near North
</p>
<p>Avenue we met Thielen. I afterwards went to the prairie with a detective,
</p>
<p>about May igth or 2oth, to find the things that Lingg had given me. The
</p>
<p>bombs and the dynamite, the fuse and the caps were still there."
</p>
<p>"Have you ever been a member of any Socialistic organization?"
</p>
<p>"I have been a member of the North Side Group of the International
</p>
<p>Workingmen's Association. I belonged to the group about three months
</p>
<p>prior to the 4th of May. The group met at 58 Clybourn Avenue, regularly,
</p>
<p>every Monday evening. We talked together there, advised together, and
</p>
<p>reviewed what had happened among the workingmen during the week.
</p>
<p>We had hunting-guns and shot-guns with which we drilled. I kept my
</p>
<p>gun at my house."
</p>
<p>" Did you ever attend a dance at Florus' Hall ? "
</p>
<p>"Yes, about March of this year. It was a ball of the Carpenters'

</p>
<p>dollars' profit on the beer. The money, according to a resolution passed at
</p>
<p>the next meeting of the Carpenters' Union, at 71 West Lake Street, was
</p>
<p>handed over to Lingg, with the instruction to buy dynamite with it, and

<p>speech at 58 Clybourn Avenue, about January or February of this year,
</p>
<p>before the assembled workingmen of the North Side. He said those who
</p>
<p>could not buy revolvers should buy dynamite. It was cheap and easily
</p>
<p>handled. A gas-pipe was to be taken and a wooden plug put into the ends,
</p>
<p>and it was to be filled with dynamite. Then the other end is also closed up
</p>
<p>with a wooden plug, and old nails are tied around the pipe by means of
</p>
<p>wire. Then a hole is bored into one end of it, and a fuse with a cap is put
</p>
<p>into that hole. I was chairman at that meeting. Engel said some gas-pipe
</p>
<p>was to be found on the West Side, near the river, near the bridge."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination Lehman stated :
</p>
<p>" The meeting at which Engel spoke was a public, open-door meeting.
</p>
<p>A notice under the signal 'Y,' which was understood to be the call for a
</p>
<p>meeting at 54 West Lake Street, I have seen once before. I belonged to
</p>
<p>the armed section for about three or four months. The meetings of the
</p>
<p>armed section at 54 West Lake Street were irregular, governed by such a
</p>
<p>notice in the Arbeiter-Zeitung. I did not see Lingg at 54 West Lake Street
</p>
<p>that Monday night. I don't know that he was there. As wewent home

</p>
<p>he came up to us from behind on the sidewalk. Whether he was there or
</p>
<p>not I cannot say. When I went to Clybourn Avenue Tuesday night, Lingg
</p>
<p>was not there. Seliger went down in the basement at the meeting at
</p>
<p>54 Lake Street Monday night. He was there for some time, but I cannot
</p>
<p>tell how long. I am sure about that. We went there together from where
</p>
<p>the carpenters' meeting was to have taken place. I, my brother, he and
</p>
<p>several others went down together. I am as sure of Seliger's having been
</p>
<p>down there in the basement that night as of any fact that I have testified to."
</p>
<p>JEREMIAH SULLIVAN, a detective, testified :
</p>
<p>'"I was on the Market Square on the night of the inauguration of the
</p>
<p>Board of Trade with Officer Trehorn. When we got down there, there was
</p>
<p>quite a large crowd. One or two people were talking in German and try-
</p>
<p>ing to hold the crowd until the speakers came. Mr. Schwab came there
</p>
<p>first, and Parsons and Fielden came, and I believe this man (indicating
</p>
<p>Lingg). Parsons spoke about the Board of Trade, and showed some
</p>
<p>figures how the poor man was robbed. Then he denounced the police as
</p>
<p>bloodhounds, the militia as servants of the capitalists, robbing the laboring
</p>
<p>classes, and invited them all in a body to go there and partake of some of
</p>
<p>those twenty-dollar dishes that they had up at the Board of Trade building.
</p>
<p>They were to get there by force. Mr. Fielden spoke after him. He de-
</p>
<p>nounced the police and militia as bloodhounds. At that time there was
</p>
<p>a company of militia on Market Square for the purpose of drilling. Mr.
</p>
<p>Schwab was there at the time, and called the attention of the crowd to the
</p>
<p>militia, and they all started off toward the militia. Schwab spoke in Ger-
</p>
<p>man. Officer Trehorn and I went over there and asked the militia to dis-
</p>
<p>perse, and they marched up Water Street. Then I came back and listened
</p>
<p>to Mr. Fielden, who urged the crowd to force themselves in in a body and
</p>
<p>partake of those dishes. Then they all marched in a body, some carrying
</p>
<p>red flags. I saw in the procession Schwab, Parsons, Fielden, and I am not
</p>
<p>positive as to that young fellow (Lingg). There was no United States flag
</p>
<p>in the procession. There was a platoon of police at every crossing. The
</p>
<p>procession stopped at 107 Fifth Avenue. Parsons went in and spoke from
</p>
<p>the window. He denounced the policemen as bloodhounds, and the militia
</p>
<p>also, and stated how they stopped them from going in there and partaking

<p>of the food ; that a good many of his audience did not have clothes and
</p>
<p>could not afford to pay twenty cents for a meal, let alone twenty dollars,
</p>
<p>and wanted them to go and follow him, and he would make a raid on those
</p>
<p>different places, mentioning Marshall Field's and one or two other places.
</p>
<p>After him Fielden spoke, and wanted them all to go down with him in a
</p>
<p>body and he would lead them. I met Williamson, the reporter, just as he
</p>
<p>was coming down-stairs, that evening. We went up-stairs with him. I
</p>
<p>shook hands with Mr. Fielden and spoke to him. They did not know me
</p>
<p>as a policeman. Fielden, Parsons and Schwab were there. Spies was at the
</p>
<p>desk. Parsons asked Spies for this dynamite. He brought it over, and Par-
</p>
<p>sons told how it could be used ; that if it was thrown into a line of police
</p>
<p>or militia it would take the whole platoon. He also exhibited a coil of fuse.
</p>
<p>I said : ' You can get that in any quarry. They use that in blasting powder. '
</p>
<p>He said : ' It comes in good to load these with to touch these off with,'
</p>
<p>referring to dynamite shells. I saw some caps there about the size of a 22-
</p>
<p>caliber cartridge. The substance which he showed was dynamite. It
</p>
<p>looked like red sand. It was shaped about a foot long, and about an inch

</p>
<p>and a half in diameter. I asked one of them why they didn't go into the
</p>
<p>Board of Trade building. They said that they were not prepared that night ;
</p>
<p>that there were too many of the bloodhounds before them on the street,
</p>
<p>but the next time they would turn out they would meet them with their own
</p>
<p>weapons and worse. "
</p>
<p>MORITZ NEFF testified :
</p>
<p>also
</p>
<p>as
</p>
<p>"I live at 58 Clybourn Avenue, known as Thuringer Hall,
</p>
<p>Neff's Hall, since seven years. I keep a saloon
</p>
<p>there. Back of the saloon is a hall. The
</p>
<p>North Side group used to meet there. I know
</p>
<p>all the defendants. On the night when the
</p>
<p>bomb was thrown I was at my saloon. Louis
</p>
<p>Lingg came in, in company with Seliger and
</p>
<p>another man whom I had not seen before.
</p>
<p>This stranger carried the satchel. It was a
</p>
<p>common bag, probably about a foot and a half
</p>
<p>long and six inches wide. He put it on the
</p>
<p>counter, after that on the floor. Lingg and
</p>
<p>Seliger were standing by, and Lingg asked me
</p>
<p>if some one had asked for him. That stranger,
</p>
<p>whose name I afterwards found out to be
</p>
<p>Muntzenberg, carried the satchel on his
</p>
<p>shoulder ; that was ten or fifteen minutes after
</p>
<p>eight. I told Lingg that nobody had inquired
</p>
<p>for him. Then Muntzenberg picked up the bag
</p>
<p>and went out the side door, in the rear of the
</p>
<p>room, followed by Lingg and Seliger. I have
</p>
<p>not seen the bag since. There was a large
</p>
<p>meeting of painters, probably two hundred, in
</p>
<p>the hall that evening. For this reason I opened
</p>
<p>this door in the rear of the saloon, so that people

</p>
<p>going to that meeting would not be compelled
</p>
<p>to go through the saloon. I saw Lingg and
</p>
<p>Seliger again that night about eleven o'clock.
</p>
<p>Nobody had inquired in the meantime for
</p>
<p>Lingg. I saw Hubner there before Lingg
</p>
<p>came. I saw Thielen on the sidewalk in front
</p>
<p>of the saloon, but not inside. The two Leh-
</p>
<p>mans were there after Lingg had left. They
</p>
<p>were out on the sidewalk, not inside. The
</p>
<p>first time Lingg stayed about five or ten
</p>
<p>minutes. He went out through the saloon. I
</p>
<p>did not see Seliger and Muntzenberg go out
</p>
<p>through the saloon. Before Lingg and Seliger
</p>
<p>came back, at about eleven o'clock, several in-
</p>
<p>dividuals had come into the saloon, among
</p>
<p>them the Hermanns, the two Lehmans, the
</p>
<p>two Hagemans and Hirschberger. Lingg and Seliger dropped in a little
</p>
<p>later. They were all talking together. I didn't pay much attention to it.
</p>
<p>I heard one of them halloa out very loud, ' That is all your fault. ' I heard
</p>
<p>them also say that the bomb had been thrown among the police and some
</p>
<p>of them had been killed. They came from the meeting.

</p>
<p>"Engel addressed the North Side, group in my hall in February last
</p>
<p>winter. It was a public agitation meeting of the North Side group, adver-
</p>
<p>tised in the Arbeiter-ZeHiing."
</p>
<p>"What did Engel say?'
</p>
<p>" He wanted money for a new paper, the Anarchist, started by the
</p>
<p>Northwest Side group and two of the South Side groups. He said the
</p>
<p>Arbeiter-Zeitung was not outspoken enough in those Anarchistic principles ;
</p>
<p>therefore they started this paper. They distributed some of these papers.
</p>
<p>Later on he gave a kind of history of revolutions in the old country, stated
</p>
<p>that the nobility of France were only forced to give up their privileges by
</p>
<p>brute force ; that the slaveholders in the South were compelled by force to
</p>
<p>liberate their slaves, and the present wage-slavery would be done away
</p>
<p>with only by force also. And he advised them to arm themselves, and if
</p>
<p>guns were too dear for them they should use cheaper weapons dynamite
</p>
<p>or anything they could get hold of to fight the enemy. To make bombs,
</p>
<p>anything that was hollow in the shape of gas-pipes would do. That is all
</p>
<p>I' heard him say. I wasn't present all the time. I bought a copy of the
</p>
<p>Anarchist that night for five cents. This here (indicating) is one of the
</p>
<p>copies, dated January i, 1886. This is one of the copies distributed that
</p>
<p>night. Engel did not distribute it himself. Two other gentlemen who

</p>
<p>THE examination of witnesses continued from day to day before a
</p>
<p>crowded court-room. At times tilts between the attorneys and long
</p>
<p>arguments on knotty legal points varied the proceedings. Every coigne of
</p>
<p>vantage occupied by the State was stubbornly contested by counsel for the
</p>
<p>defendants. But the prosecution maintained its position and brought out
</p>
<p>all the material evidence it had accumulated. The theory of the State with
</p>
<p>reference to conspiracy, murder and " accessory before the fact " was grad-
</p>
<p>ually being developed with force and effect. Newspaper reporters proved
</p>
<p>important witnesses and rendered the State great service.
</p>
<p>The greatest interest at this stage of the trial was taken in the testimony
</p>
<p>of ANDREW C. JOHNSON, a Pinkerton detective, who became a member
</p>
<p>of the International Workingmen's Association February 22, 1885, or rather
</p>
<p>on March i, 1885, a few days later, for it was on that day that he got his
</p>
<p>red card of membership, bearing his number, and began his series of
</p>
<p>reports to the agency.
</p>
<p>Among a number of minor particulars, Johnson told how the blowing up
</p>
<p>of the Board of Trade was proposed on March 29 by Fielden, and indorsed
</p>
<p>by others. The most interesting part of his story, however, is the descrip-
</p>
<p>tion of his admission into the armed group. This took place on August 24,
</p>
<p>at Greif's Hall. Said Johnson :
</p>
<p>" There were twenty or twenty-three men and two women present. It
</p>
<p>was Monday night. Among them Parsons, Fielden, besides Walters,
</p>
<p>Bodendick, Boyd and Larson, Parker, Franklin and Snyder. After having
</p>
<p>been there a short time, a man armed with a long cavalry sword, dressed in
</p>
<p>a blue blouse, wearing a slouch hat, came into the room. He ordered all
</p>
<p>those present to fall in. He then called off certain names, and all those
</p>
<p>present answered to their names. He then inquired whether there were
</p>
<p>any new members who wished to join the military company. Those who
</p>
<p>did should step to the front. Myself and two others did so. We were

</p>
<p>asked separately to give our names. My name was put down in a book,
</p>
<p>and I was told my number was 16. Previous to my name being put down
</p>
<p>the man asked whether any one present could vouch for me as a true man.
</p>
<p>Parsons and Bodendick vouched for me. The same process was gone
</p>
<p>through in regard to the other two. The man then inquired of two other
</p>
<p>men in the room, whether they were members of the American group, and
</p>
<p>asked to see their cards, and as they were unable to produce their cards he
</p>
<p>told them to leave the room. Two others were expelled. The doors were
</p>
<p>446 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>closed and the remainder were asked to fall in line. For about half an
</p>
<p>hour or three-quarters we were put through the regular manual drill,
</p>
<p>marching, counter-marching, turning, forming fours, wheeling, etc. That
</p>
<p>man with a sword drilled us. He was evidently a German. After that he
</p>
<p>stated he would now introduce some of the members of the first company
</p>
<p>of the German organization. He went out and in a few minutes returned
</p>
<p>with ten other men dressed like himself, each one armed with a Springfield
</p>
<p>rifle. He placed them in line in front of us and introduced them as mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the first company of the L. u. W. V., and proceeded to drill them
</p>
<p>about ten minutes. After that a man whose name I do not know he was
</p>
<p>employed by the proprietor of the saloon at 54 West Lake Street came
</p>
<p>into the room with two tin boxes, which he placed on a table. The drill
</p>
<p>instructor asked us to examine them, as they were the latest improved
</p>
<p>dynamite bomb. They had the appearance of ordinary preserve fruit cans,
</p>
<p>the top part unscrewed. The inside of the cans was filled with a light
</p>
<p>brown mixture. There was also a small glass tube inserted in the center
</p>
<p>of the can. The tube was in connection with a screw, and it was explained
</p>
<p>that when the can was thrown against any hard substance it would explode.
</p>
<p>Inside of the glass tube was a liquid- Around the glass tube was a
</p>
<p>brownish mixture which looked like fine saw-dust. The drill instructor told
</p>
<p>us we ought to be very careful in the selection of new members of the com-
</p>
<p>pany, otherwise there was no telling who might get into our midst. After
</p>
<p>that a man named Walters was chosen as captain, and defendant Parsons
</p>
<p>for lieutenant. We decided to call ourselves the International Rifles. The
</p>
<p>drill instructor then suggested that we ought to choose some other hall, as
</p>
<p>we were not quite safe there, and added, ' We have a fine place at 636
</p>
<p>Milwaukee Avenue. We have a short range in the basement, where we
</p>
<p>practice shooting regularly.' Parsons inquired whether we couldn't rent
</p>
<p>the same place, and the drill instructor said he didn't know. Then the
</p>
<p>time for the next meeting of the armed section was fixed for the following
</p>
<p>Monday. Parsons and Fielden drilled with us that evening. They were
</p>
<p>present also with a number of others at the next meeting, on August 31, at
</p>
<p>54 West Lake Street. Capt. Walters drilled us for about an hour and a
</p>
<p>half. Then we had a discussion as to the best way of procuring arms.

</p>
<p>Some one suggested that each member pay a weekly amount until he had
</p>
<p>enough to purchase a rifle for each member of the company. Parsons sug-
</p>
<p>gested : ' Look here, boys ; why can't we make a raid some night on the
</p>
<p>militia armory? There are only two or three men on guard there, and it is
</p>
<p>easily done.' This suggestion was favored by some members, but after
</p>
<p>some more discussion the matter of the raid on the armory was put off until
</p>
<p>the nights got a little bit longer."
</p>
<p>The witness, whose testimony was very lengthy, refreshed his memory
</p>
<p>from copies of reports which he had made at the time. On cross-
</p>
<p>examination he was asked why the reports were countersigned by L. J.
</p>
<p>Gage. He replied that he did not know why they were so countersigned,
</p>
<p>but he found that they were. The history he had to tell bore chiefly upon
</p>
<p>the facts leading up to the riot at the Haymarket.
</p>
<p>JOSEPH GRUENHUT, a factory and tenement-house inspector of the Health
</p>
<p>Department of the city, had known Spies for six years, Parsons about
</p>
<p>ten years, Fielden and Schwab about two years, more or less.
</p>
<p>JOE GRUENHUTS TESTIMONY. 447
</p>
<p>"I have known Neebe perhaps fifteen or twenty years. I was in the
</p>
<p>habit of meeting some of them daily, at labor meetings or at the office of the
</p>
<p>Arbeiter-Zeitung. I am myself interested in labor movements, formerly
</p>
<p>the Labor Party of the United States. It changed its name into the
</p>
<p>Socialistic Labor Party. I am a Socialist. I don't consider myself an
</p>
<p>Anarchist. I am not a member of any group of the Internationals in the
</p>
<p>city, nor of the Lehr und Wehr Verein. I was present at interviews
</p>
<p>between the reporter Wilkinson and Mr. Spies. I introduced Mr. Wil-
</p>
<p>kinson to Mr. Spies at the Arbeiter-Zeitung office in the forenoon, and on
</p>
<p>the evening of the same day, I believe, I was present at a conversation
</p>
<p>between them at a restaurant on Madison Street. We took supper there
</p>
<p>together. "
</p>
<p>" State the conversation which took place there between Spies and the
</p>
<p>reporter."
</p>
<p>"Mr. Wilkinson asked him how many members belonged to the mili-
</p>
<p>tary societies of organized trade and labor unions. Spies said that there
</p>
<p>were many thousand ; that these organizations were open to everybody,
</p>
<p>and at meetings people were asked to become members, but their names
</p>
<p>would not be known, because they would be numbered, and they didn't
</p>
<p>keep any record of names. Mr. Spies laid some toothpicks on the table
</p>
<p>so as to show the position of armed men on tops of houses, on street
</p>
<p>corners, and how they could keep a company of militia or police in check
</p>
<p>by the use of dynamite bombs. The conversation was carried on in a
</p>
<p>conversational tone, half joking, etc., and it lasted perhaps a quarter of an
</p>
<p>hour, while we were taking our supper."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination Mr. Gruenhut stated that he had heard no
</p>
<p>reference to any attack to be made on the first of May, and in the re-direct
</p>
<p>examination he said, with reference to Spies' attitude on the eight-hour
</p>
<p>movement :
</p>
<p>" At the start he said he did not believe they would get it, and then it
</p>
<p>would not amount to anything anyhow; it was only a palliative measure
</p>
<p>not radical enough. As I recollect, I brought him a list of the different or-
</p>
<p>ganizations in Chicago, and we were trying to pick out those which needed
</p>
<p>organization, and the packers and a great many others were directly organ-

</p>
<p>ized by these men for the eight-hour movement. We were in constant con-
</p>
<p>sultation about organizing those trades which had not been organized before.
</p>
<p>I don't suppose he ever said that he was in favor of the eight-hour move-
</p>
<p>ment. I don't know that he -was ever enthusiastically in favor of the eight-
</p>
<p>hour movement, but he was enthusiastically in favor of the eight-hour
</p>
<p>movement that we had talked about on Monday. There never had been a
</p>
<p>general eight-hour mass-meeting. There had been a mass-meeting repre-
</p>
<p>senting the great assemblies, at the Armory, but not the Central Labor
</p>
<p>Union. It was a Socialistic organization; was not represented there. In
</p>
<p>October, 1885, there had been a mass-meeting of the Socialistic organiza-
</p>
<p>tions in favor of the eight-hour movement at West Twelfth Street Turner
</p>
<p>Hall. I was not there. At the time I had that conversation with Mr. Spies
</p>
<p>and the others present about a mass-meeting to be held, we did not know
</p>
<p>where the meeting was to be held at all. We only considered the advisa-
</p>
<p>bility of holding a mass-meeting on the question of the eight-hour move-
</p>
<p>ment in the open air. There are only three or four places where you can hold
</p>
<p>448 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>such a meeting ; either the lake front or Market Square or the Haymarket.
</p>
<p>At that time I am sure I saw Spies, Rau and Neebe almost every day, but
</p>
<p>I could not tell whether the meeting was agreed upon on Saturday or Mon-
</p>
<p>day, night or day ; but there was a general agreement upon having one gen-
</p>
<p>eral mass-meeting in the open air. It was not sure whether the meeting
</p>
<p>was to be in the forenoon, afternoon or night, but at last we came to the
</p>
<p>conclusion it ought to be at night. My recollection is that Spies said to
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, at the time of that conversation, that the military associations
</p>
<p>were open and free to everybody ; that they meet, advertise their meetings,
</p>
<p>have picnics and advertise them, and meet in halls, even in open ground, at
</p>
<p>Sheffield, or out on the prairie. That proposed mass-meeting was to be an
</p>
<p>eight-hour meeting and an indignation meeting over the killing of men at
</p>
<p>McCormick's at the same time. Parsons and Spies, during conversations
</p>
<p>within the twelve months before the bomb was thrown, said that arming
</p>
<p>meant the use of dynamite bombs by individuals ; all men should individ-
</p>
<p>ually self-help, as against a squad of policeman or company of militia, so
</p>
<p>that they need not be an army."
</p>
<p>F. H. NEWMAN, a physician, attended some of the officers wounded at
</p>
<p>the" Hay market, and identified an iron nut extracted from Hahn. He had
</p>
<p>also examined some ten or twelve officers, and had found some bullets and
</p>
<p>fragments of a combination of metals much lighter than lead. "The
</p>
<p>fragments were also much lighter," he said, " than the bullets, varying
</p>
<p>very much in size, from perhaps what we would call 22-caliber up to
</p>
<p>45-caliber. The bullets also varied in size. This piece of metal I
</p>
<p>took from the heel of Officer Barber. It made a ragged wound and was
</p>
<p>buried in the bone ; crushed the bone considerably, fractured it in several
</p>
<p>places. I examined the wounds of one officer who had a large ragged
</p>
<p>wound in the liver. He died within a few hours. It could have been a
</p>
<p>wound produced by a bullet, if the bullet was very ragged, spread out con-
</p>
<p>siderably, as they do sometimes."
</p>
<p>MAXWELL E. DICKSON, a newspaper reporter, had had several interviews
</p>
<p>with Parsons. He said :
</p>
<p>".The last time I met Mr. Parsons, either the latter part of last year or
</p>
<p>the commencement of this year, he gave me two or three papers, and one of

</p>
<p>them contained one or two diagrams, a plan of warfare. Parsons stated
</p>
<p>that the social revolution would be brought about in the way that paper
</p>
<p>would describe. In November of last year, some time after that demon-
</p>
<p>stration on the Market Square, I remarked to Parsons, in a sort of joking
</p>
<p>way, 'You are not going to blowup anybody, are you?' He said : 'I don't say
</p>
<p>that we won't, I don't know that we won't, but you will see the revolution
</p>
<p>brought about, and sooner than you think for.' I attended a number of
</p>
<p>meetings at which some of the defendants spoke.
</p>
<p>"The Twelfth Street Turner Hall meeting was a meeting called for the
</p>
<p>purpose of discussing the Socialistic platform. A circular had been issued,
</p>
<p>in which public men, clergy, employers and others who were interested in
</p>
<p>the social question were invited to be present to discuss the question of the
</p>
<p>social movement. The hall was crowded. During the meeting Mr. Par-
</p>
<p>sons made a speech, during which he said that the degradation of labor was
</p>
<p>REPORTER DICKSON'S TESTIMONY.
</p>
<p>449
</p>
<p>brought about by what was known as the rights of private property ; he
</p>
<p>quoted a long line of statistics, showing that an average man with a capital
</p>
<p>of five thousand dollars was enabled to make four thousand dollars a year,
</p>
<p>and thus get rich, while his employe, who made the money for him, obtained
</p>
<p>but $340, and there were upwards of two million heads of families who were
</p>
<p>in want, or bordering on want, making their living either by theft, robbery
</p>
<p>or any such occupation as they could get work in ; and he said that, while
</p>
<p>they were the champions of free speech and social order, it would be hard
</p>
<p>for the man who stood in the way of liberty, fraternity and equality to all.
</p>
<p>Later on Fielden spoke and said that the majority of men were starving
</p>
<p>because of over-production, and went on to show that overcoats were being
</p>
<p>sent to Africa, to the Congo states, which were needed at home, and he
</p>
<p>could not understand how that was. As a Socialist, he believed in the
</p>
<p>equal rights of every man to live. The present condition of the laboring
</p>
<p>man was due to the domination of capital,
</p>
<p>and they could expect no remedy from
</p>
<p>legislatures, and there were enough pres-
</p>
<p>ent in the hall to take Chicago from the
</p>
<p>grasp of the capitalists ; that capital must
</p>
<p>divide with labor ; that the time was
</p>
<p>coming when a contest would arise be-
</p>
<p>tween capital and labor. He was.no
</p>
<p>alarmist, but the Socialist should be pre-
</p>
<p>pared for the victory when it did come.
</p>
<p>Several other persons spoke after that.
</p>
<p>Then Spies spoke in German, advising
</p>
<p>the workingmen to organize in order to
</p>
<p>obtain their rights, and that they might
</p>
<p>be prepared for the emergency. Then
</p>
<p>there were resolutions adopted denounc-
</p>
<p>ing the capitalists, the editors and clergy-
</p>
<p>men, and those who had refused to come
</p>
<p>to hear the truth spoken and discuss the

</p>
<p>question, whereupon the meeting ad-
</p>
<p>journed.
</p>
<p>"At the meeting at Mueller's Hall
</p>
<p>Fielden presided and Mr. Griffin spoke first, advocating the use of force to
</p>
<p>right social wrongs. A young man named Lichtner said he was in favor
</p>
<p>of Socialistic ideas, but opposed to the use of force. Schwab, in German,
</p>
<p>said that the gap between the rich and the poor was growing wider ; that,
</p>
<p>although despotism in Russia had endeavored to suppress Nihilism by
</p>
<p>executing some and sending others to Siberia, Nihilism was still growing.
</p>
<p>And he praised Reinsdorf, who had then been recently executed in Europe,
</p>
<p>but stated that his death had been avenged by the killing of Rumpf, the
</p>
<p>Chief of Police of Frankfort, who had been industrious in endeavoring to
</p>
<p>crush out Socialism ; that murder was forced on many a man through the
</p>
<p>misery brought on him by capital ; that freedom in the United States was
</p>
<p>a farce, and in Illinois was literally unknown; that both of the political
</p>
<p>parties were corrupt, and what was needed here was a bloody revolution
</p>
<p>which would right their wrongs.
</p>
<p>" A young man named Gorsuch was against all government, which was
</p>
<p>made for slaves. The only way the workingmen could get their rights was
</p>
<p>ADOLPH LIESKE.

</p>
<p>by the Gatling gun, by absolute brute force. Then Mr. Fielden called upon
</p>
<p>the capitalists to answer these arguments and to save their property, for
</p>
<p>when the Socialists decided to appropriate the property of the capitalists it
</p>
<p>would be too late for the capitalists to save anything.
</p>
<p>" Then Spies said in German that the workingmen should revolt at
</p>
<p>once. He had been accused of giving this advice before, it was true, and
</p>
<p>he was proud of it. That wage slavery could only be abolished through
</p>
<p>powder and ball. The ballot was a sort of skin game. He compared it to
</p>
<p>a deck of cards in which there was a marked deck put in the place of the
</p>
<p>genuine, and in which the poor man got all of the skin cards, so that, when
</p>
<p>the dealer laid down the cards, his money was taken from him. Then Spies
</p>
<p>offered these resolutions, which were adopted :
</p>
<p>" 'Whereas, our comrades in Germany have slain one of the dirtiest dogs
</p>
<p>of his Majesty Lehmann, the greatest disgrace of the present time namely,,
</p>
<p>the spy Rumpf.
</p>
<p>" 'Resolved, That we rejoice over and applaud the noble and heroic act/
</p>
<p>"Then Parsons offered some resolutions favoring the abolition of the
</p>
<p>present social system, and the formation of a new social cooperative system
</p>
<p>that would bring about an equality between capital and labor.
</p>
<p>" The next meeting I attended was on the Market Square, on Thanks-
</p>
<p>giving day. Mr. Parsons asked what they had to be thankful for, whether
</p>
<p>it was for their poverty, their lack of sufficient food and clothing, etc., and
</p>
<p>argued that the capitalists on the avenue spent more money for wine at
</p>
<p>one meal than some of them received pay in a month. Fielden said they
</p>
<p>would be justified ingoing over to Marshall Field's and taking out from
</p>
<p>there that which belonged to them. A series of resolutions were adopted,
</p>
<p>offered, I believe, by Parsons, denouncing the President for having set apart
</p>
<p>Thanksgiving day that it was a fallacy and a fraud; that the working-
</p>
<p>men had nothing to be thankful for ; that only a few obtained the riches
</p>
<p>that were produced, while the many had to starve."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination Mr. Dickson said :
</p>
<p>"Parsons said to me that when the social revolution came, it would be
</p>
<p>better for all men ; it would place every man on an equality. He pictured
</p>
<p>me personally as a wage slave, referring to my position as a newspaper

</p>
<p>reporter, and that all reforms had to be brought about through revolution,
</p>
<p>and bloodshed could not be avoided. I frequently heard him give expres-
</p>
<p>sion to such ideas in friendly conversation, in which the social outlook of
</p>
<p>the country was talked over, and Parsons frequently insisted that any
</p>
<p>method would be justifiable to accomplish the object which he advocated
</p>
<p>as the intended result of a social revolution. Parsons once stated to me
</p>
<p>that if it became necessary they would use dynamite, and it might become
</p>
<p>necessary. Parsons never expressed any distinct proposal to inaugurate
</p>
<p>the revolution at any particular time, or by the use of any particular force.
</p>
<p>He simply spoke of the social revolution as the inevitable future. I am not
</p>
<p>certain as to whether the paper which Parsons gave me, which contained
</p>
<p>those diagrams, was a copy of the Alarm or of some other paper. This
</p>
<p>article here in the Alarm of July 25, 1885 (indicating), under the title,
</p>
<p>'Street Fighting How to Meet the Enemy,' is, to the best of my recol-
</p>
<p>lection, the article to which my attention was called by Mr. Parsons at the
</p>
<p>time. I am positive these diagrams here (indicating) are the same as in
</p>
<p>the article given me by Parsons.

<p>REPORTER HULL'S TESTIMONY.
</p>
<p>" The position of these parties in meetings that I have attended, since
</p>
<p>January 18, 1885, when they spoke of the industrial condition, was that they
</p>
<p>predicted a social revolution, and they also advised the workingmen to
</p>
<p>bring about that revolution. It was Mr. Fielden on the lake front I can-
</p>
<p>not fix the date who used language of that import, advised the men to go
</p>
<p>forward and get that which did belong to them by force. "
</p>
<p>PAUL C. HULL, a reporter of the Daily News, attended the Haymarket
</p>
<p>meeting and heard Fielden speak. He testified as follows :
</p>
<p>"When the bomb exploded I was on the iron stairway, about four steps
</p>
<p>from the top landing. After the bomb exploded the firing began from the
</p>
<p>crowd before the police fired. I saw the bomb in the air. My head was
</p>
<p>probably within twelve or fifteen feet above the crowd. It was quite dark.
</p>
<p>Directly opposite me was a pile of boxes on the sidewalk, and an area-way
</p>
<p>surrounded by an iron railing. My eyes were directed toward the
</p>
<p>speakers' wagon. As the words were in his mouth, I saw arching through
</p>
<p>the air the
</p>
<p>sparks of the
</p>
<p>burning fuse.
</p>
<p>According to
</p>
<p>my recollection
</p>
<p>it seemed to
</p>
<p>com e from
</p>
<p>about fifteen or

</p>
<p>seemed to throw to the ground the second and third divisions of police.
</p>
<p>At almost the same instant there was a rattling of shots that came from
</p>
<p>both sides of the street and not from the police. The meeting was noisy
</p>
<p>and turbulent. When the speaking began there were about eight hundred
</p>
<p>to one thousand people in the crowd. At the time the police came it
</p>
<p>had dwindled away a third from what it was at its largest number. About
</p>
<p>a quarter of the crowd, that part which clustered about the wagon, were
</p>
<p>enthusiasts, loudly applauded the speakers and cheered them on by
</p>
<p>remarks. The outskirts of the crowd seemed to regard the speakers with
</p>
<p>indifference, often laughed at them and hooted them.
</p>
<p>" Spies told his version of the McCormick riot. He had been charged
</p>
<p>with being responsible for the riot and the death of those men, by Mr.
</p>
<p>McCormick. He said Mr. McCormick was a liar and was himself respon-
</p>
<p>sible for the death of the six men which he claimed were killed at that
</p>
<p>time ; that he had addressed a meeting on the prairie, and when the
</p>
<p>factory bell rang a body of the meeting which he was addressing detached
</p>
<p>themselves and went toward the factory, and that there the riot occurred.
</p>
<p>He then touched upon the dominating question of labor and capital and
</p>
<p>their relations very briefly, and asked what meant this array of Catling
</p>
<p>452 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>guns, infantry ready to arms, patrol wagons and policemen, and deduced
</p>
<p>from that that it was the Government or capitalists preparing to crush
</p>
<p>them, should they try to right their wrongs. I don't remember that he
</p>
<p>said anything in his speech about the means to be employed against that
</p>
<p>capitalistic force.
</p>
<p>" Parsons dealt considerably in labor statistics. He drew the conclusion
</p>
<p>that the capitalists got eighty-five cents out of the dollar, and the laboring
</p>
<p>man fifteen cents, and that the eight-hour agitation and the agitation of the
</p>
<p>social question was a still hunt after the other eighty-five cents. He
</p>
<p>advised the using of violent means by the workingmen to right their
</p>
<p>wrongs. Said that law and government was the tool of the wealthy to
</p>
<p>oppress the poor ; that the ballot was no way in which to right their
</p>
<p>wrongs. That could only be done by physical force.
</p>
<p>"I only heard a part of Fielden's speech. He said Martin Foran had
</p>
<p>been sent to Congress to represent the Labor Party, and he did not do it
</p>
<p>satisfactorily. When McCormick's name was mentioned during the
</p>
<p>speeches there were exclamations like 'Hang him, ' or 'Throw him into
</p>
<p>the lake.' Some such a remark would be made when any prominent
</p>
<p>Chicago capitalist's name was used. When some one in the crowd cried
</p>
<p>'Let's hang him now,' when some man's name was mentioned, one of the
</p>
<p>speakers, either Spies or Parsons, said, 'No, we are not ready yet.' '
</p>
<p>On cross-examination Mr. Hull said :
</p>
<p>" The firing of the revolvers startled me. I considered my position
</p>
<p>dangerous and tried to get around the corner. A few moments before the
</p>
<p>explosion of the bomb a threatening cloud came up, and Mr. Spies said the
</p>
<p>meeting would adjourn to 54 West Lake Street, I believe. At no time
</p>
<p>during the meeting was I as near as eight or ten feet from the speaker. I
</p>
<p>don't believe I heard Fielden say, in a loud voice, ' There come the blood-
</p>
<p>hounds ! Now you do your duty and I'll do mine,' when the police were
</p>
<p>coming up. I remember that Mr. Fielden said ' in conclusion,' after I got
</p>
<p>my position on the stairs again, and when the police were forming and
</p>
<p>marching below. I was confused at the time I wrote my reports. (After
</p>
<p>examining his report in a copy of Daily News of May 5th, 1886 :) I have
</p>
<p>said nowhere in this report that the crowd fired upon the police. I did say

</p>
<p>that the police required no orders before firing upon the crowd. I wrote
</p>
<p>this up about an hour after the occurrence. After describing the explosion
</p>
<p>of the bomb, I used this language in my report : ' For an instant after the
</p>
<p>explosion the crowd seemed paralyzed, but, with the revolver shots crack-
</p>
<p>ing like a tattoo on a mighty drum, and the bullets flying in the air, the
</p>
<p>mob plunged away into the darkness with a yell of rage and fear.' My
</p>
<p>recollection is that the bomb struck the ground about on a line with the
</p>
<p>south line of the alley. The bomb apparently fell north from the point
</p>
<p>where I first saw it in the air. I judge it came from the south, going west-
</p>
<p>northwest."
</p>
<p>WHITING ALLEN, another reporter, was present at the Haymarket meet-
</p>
<p>ing in company with Mr. Tuttle, another newspaper man, and heard some
</p>
<p>of the speeches. Said the witness :
</p>
<p>" Parsons was speaking when we got there. About the only thing that
</p>
<p>I could quote from his speech is this : ' What good are these strikes going
</p>
<p>to do ? Do you think that anything will be accomplished by them ? Do

</p>
<p>you think the workingmen are going to gain their point ? No, no ; they
</p>
<p>will not. The result of them will be that you will have to go back to work
</p>
<p>for less money than you are getting.' That is his language in effect. At
</p>
<p>one time he mentioned the name of Jay Gould. There were cries from the
</p>
<p>crowd, 'Hang Jay Gould!' 'Throw him into the lake!' and soon. He
</p>
<p>said, ' No, no ; that would not do any good. If you would hang Jay Gould
</p>
<p>now, there would be another, and perhaps a hundred, up to-morrow. It
</p>
<p>don't do any good to hang one man ; you have to kill them all, or get rid
</p>
<p>of them all.' Then he went on to say that it was not the individual, but
</p>
<p>the system ; that the government should be destroyed. It was the wrong
</p>
<p>government, and these people who supported it had to be destroyed. I
</p>
<p>heard him cry, ' To arms ! ' I cannot tell in what connection. The crowd
</p>
<p>was extremely turbulent. It seemed to be thoroughly in sympathy with
</p>
<p>the speakers ; was extremely excited, and applauded almost every utter-
</p>
<p>ance. I staid there some ten or fifteen minutes. I then left and went to
</p>
<p>Zepf's Hall. Later I came back again, when Fielden was speaking.
</p>
<p>When the bomb was thrown I was in the saloon of Zepf's Hall, standing
</p>
<p>about the middle of the room at the time. I did not see any of the defend-
</p>
<p>ants there. They were not there to my knowledge. When I was down at
</p>
<p>the meeting, I pointed out to Mr. Tuttle Mr. Parsons, Fielden, Spies, and
</p>
<p>a man that I presume was Mr. Schwab, but was not certain. The general
</p>
<p>outline was that of Mr. Schwab. I could not get a full view of his face.
</p>
<p>That must have been half past nine."
</p>
<p>CHARLES R. TUTTLE said he did not remember much of what Parsons
</p>
<p>spoke :
</p>
<p>"Parsons made a series of references to existing strikes one was the
</p>
<p>Southwestern strike and to Jay Gould, the head of that system of rail-
</p>
<p>ways, and the winding up of the peroration in connection with that created
</p>
<p>a great deal of excitement and many responses from the audience. He
</p>
<p>then spoke of the strike at McCormick's, and detailed the suffering of the
</p>
<p>people who had wives and children, and who were being robbed by one
</p>
<p>whom I took to be Mr. McCormick, although I cannot say that was the
</p>
<p>idea ; who were being robbed, anyway, by capitalists. And he said it was
</p>
<p>no wonder that these persons were struggling for their rights, and then said

</p>
<p>that the police had been called on by the capitalists to suppress the first
</p>
<p>indications of any movement on the part of the working people to stand up
</p>
<p>for rights, and he asked what they are going to do. One man I believe
</p>
<p>the same one who had spoken when he referred to Gould stuck up his
</p>
<p>hand with a revolver in it, and said, 'We will shoot the devils,' or some
</p>
<p>such expression, and I saw two others sticking up their hands, near to him,
</p>
<p>who made similar expressions, and had what I took to be at the time
</p>
<p>revolvers."
</p>
<p>EDWARD COSGROVE, a detective connected with the Central Station, was
</p>
<p>on duty at the Haymarket. He gave the substance of some of the speeches,
</p>
<p>and, referring to Spies, said :
</p>
<p>"Then he talked about the police, the bloodhounds of the law, shoot-
</p>
<p>ing down six of their brothers, and he said : 'When you are ready to do
</p>
<p>something, do it, and don't tell anybody you are going to.' A great num-
</p>
<p>ber of the crowd cheered him loudly. The enthusiastic part of the crowd
</p>
<p>HAYMARKET ORATORY. 455
</p>
<p>was close to the wagon. Sometimes there would be some on the outskirts.
</p>
<p>I did not hear all of Spies' speech and only part of Parsons'. Parsons
</p>
<p>talked of statistics about the price laboring men received. He said they
</p>
<p>got fifteen cents out of a dollar, and they were on the still hunt for the
</p>
<p>other eighty-five. He talked of the police and capitalists and Pinkertons.
</p>
<p>He said he was down in the Hocking Valley region, and they were only
</p>
<p>getting twenty-four cents a day, and that was less than Chinamen got.
</p>
<p>And he said his hearers would be worse than Chinamen if they didn't arm
</p>
<p>themselves, and they would be held responsible for blood that would flow
</p>
<p>in the near future. There was a great deal of cheering close to the wagon
</p>
<p>during his speech. I was in Capt. Ward's office when the police were
</p>
<p>called out. I came down the street at the time the police did. When the
</p>
<p>police came to a halt, I was on the northwest corner of Randolph and Des-
</p>
<p>plaines. I heard no firing of any kind before the explosion of the bomb,
</p>
<p>but immediately after that. I can't tell from what source the pistol shots
</p>
<p>came, whether the police fired first or the other side. I reported at the
</p>
<p>station from time to time what was going on at the meeting."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination Cosgrove said :
</p>
<p>"I was twice at the station reporting. My second report was that Mr.
</p>
<p>Parsons said they would be held responsible for the blood that would flow
</p>
<p>in the streets of America in the near future. The police remained at the
</p>
<p>station after this report. I didn't hear any part of Fielden's speech. When
</p>
<p>I came out before the police quite a number of the crowd had gone away.
</p>
<p>When I saw Schwab he was about forty feet south of the south sidewalk of
</p>
<p>Randolph Street, on Desplaines. I saw Schwab about half past eight, or a
</p>
<p>little later, at the wagon. My impression is that I saw Mr. Schwab near
</p>
<p>the close of Parsons' speech, but I am not sure. When I saw him at the
</p>
<p>wagon it was about the time Mr. Spies came back the second time to
</p>
<p>speak."
</p>
<p>TIMOTHY McKEOUGH, a detective, was present when the meeting opened.
</p>
<p>" Spies got on the wagon and called out twice : ' Is Mr. Parsons here ? '
</p>
<p>He received no answer, and said : ' Never mind, I will go and find him my-
</p>
<p>self.' Somebody said : ' Let us pull the wagon around on Randolph Street
</p>
<p>and hold the meeting there. ' Mr. Spies said: 'No, that might stop the

<p>street-cars.' He started away then, and Officer Myers and myself followed
</p>
<p>him as far as the corner. There was a man with him who, I think, was
</p>
<p>Schwab, but I am not very sure about that, and in about fifteen minutes he
</p>
<p>returned, and when I got back he was addressing the meeting, talking
</p>
<p>about what happened to their brethren the day before at McCormick's.
</p>
<p>He had been down to McCormick's and addressed a meeting, and they
</p>
<p>wanted to stop him ; tried to pull him off the car because he was a Social-
</p>
<p>ist; that while he was talking a portion of the crowd started toward
</p>
<p>McCormick's and commenced to throw stones, the most harmless amuse-
</p>
<p>ment they could have ; how wagons loaded with police came down the
</p>
<p>Black Road and commenced firing into the crowd. Somebody halloaed out :
</p>
<p>'Let us hang him,' and he said: 'My friends, when you get ready to do
</p>
<p>anything, go and do it, and say nothing about it.' About that time Parsons
</p>
<p>arrived and Spies introduced him, saying Parsons could talk better English
</p>
<p>than he, and would probably entertain them better. The crowd in the
</p>
<p>neighborhood of the wagon appeared very much excited when Spies spoke
</p>
<p>456 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>about the shooting down of workingmen at McCormick's. Parsons quoted
</p>
<p>from some book on labor statistics, which he thought his hearers probably
</p>
<p>had not read, because they didn't have the money to buy it or leisure to
</p>
<p>read it, as they had to work too much. He said out of every dollar the
</p>
<p>laboring man makes for capitalists he only gets fifteen cents, and they are
</p>
<p>on a still hunt for the other eighty-five. He had been down to the coal
</p>
<p>mines, and, according to labor statistics, they received 24^ cents for their
</p>
<p>daily labor on the average during a year. That was just half as much as
</p>
<p>the Chinaman would get, and he said : ' If we keep on we will be a great
</p>
<p>deal worse than Chinamen. I am a tenant and I pay rent to a landlord.'
</p>
<p>Somebody asked, 'What does the landlord do with it ?' Parsons said the land-
</p>
<p>lord pays taxes, the taxes pay the sheriff, the police, the Pinkertonites and
</p>
<p>the militia, who are ready to shoot them down when they are looking for
</p>
<p>their rights. He said : < I am a Socialist from the top of my head to the
</p>
<p>soles of my feet, and I will express my sentiments if I die before morning.'
</p>
<p>The crowd near the wagon loudly cheered him. Later I heard Mr. Parsons
</p>
<p>say, taking off his hat in one hand : ' To arms ! to arms ! to arms ! ' Then
</p>
<p>I went over to Desplaines Street Station and reported to Inspector Bon-
</p>
<p>field. When I came back Fielden was speaking. He criticised Martin
</p>
<p>Foran, the Congressman that was elected by the working people. Speak-
</p>
<p>ing about the law, he said the law was for the capitalists. ' Yesterday,
</p>
<p>when their brothers demanded their rights at McCormick's, the law came
</p>
<p>out and shot them down. When Mr. McCormick closed his door against
</p>
<p>them for demanding their rights, the law did not protect them.' If they
</p>
<p>loved their wives, their children, they should take the law, kill it, stab it,
</p>
<p>throttle it, or it would throttle them. That appeared to make the crowd
</p>
<p>near the wagon more excited, and I made another report to Inspector Bon-
</p>
<p>field. I saw Spies, Parsons and Fielden on the wagon. I saw Schwab on
</p>
<p>the wagon in the early part of the evening, and a man named Schnaubelt."
</p>
<p>HEN-RY E. O. HEINEMAN, a reporter of the Chicago Tribune, testified :
</p>
<p>"I saw the bomb, that is the burning fuse, rise out of the crowd and
</p>
<p>fall among the police. It rose from very nearly the southeast corner of the
</p>
<p>alley. I didn't hear any shots before the bomb exploded. Almost instantly
</p>
<p>after it shots were heard. I could not say whether the first shots came

</p>
<p>from the police or the crowd. It seems to me as if I heard some bullets
</p>
<p>close to myself, whizzing from the north as I was going south.
</p>
<p>"Spies started out by saying' that the meeting was intended to be a
</p>
<p>peaceable one it was not called to raise a disturbance and then gave his
</p>
<p>version of the affair at McCormick's, the day before. The crowd near the
</p>
<p>speaker's wagon was in sympathy with the speakers. There was occasion-
</p>
<p>ally applause. I heard a few Germans talk with one another. I heard
</p>
<p>Parsons call out toward the close of his speech, ' To arms ! to arms ! to
</p>
<p>arms ! ' Fielden, towards the end of his speech, told the crowd to kill the
</p>
<p>law, to stab it, to throttle it, or else it would throttle them. I was formerly
</p>
<p>an Internationalist. I ceased my connection with them about two years
</p>
<p>ago. At that time the defendant Neebe belonged to the same group I
</p>
<p>belonged to. It is not in existence now. I met Spies and Schwab occa-
</p>
<p>sionally in the groups. I ceased my connection with the Internationale
</p>
<p>immediately after, and on account of the lectures Herr Most delivered in
</p>
<p>this city. I saw on the wagon at the Haymarket meeting Spies, Parsons,.
</p>
<p>Fielden, and at one time Rudolph Schnaubelt."

<p>WHEN the public began to see the character of the evidence against the
</p>
<p>Anarchists, sentiment crystalized into a feeling that no fair-minded
</p>
<p>juror could be led astray by specious pleas or sophistical arguments into
</p>
<p>voting for an acquittal of any one of the defendants. The facts of the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy had been brought out with startling boldness, and with every wit-
</p>
<p>ness the points against the prisoners were fortified with added effect. One
</p>
<p>of the strongest witnesses as to the incendiary utterances of the speakers at
</p>
<p>the Haymarket meeting was G. P. English, then a reporter for the Chicago
</p>
<p>Tribune, but at present private secretary of Mayor Roche. Another was
</p>
<p>M. M. Thompson, who testified as to a conversation between Spies and
</p>
<p>Schwab.
</p>
<p>MR. ENGLISH testified as follows :
</p>
<p>" I am a reporter for the Tribune, and have been for seventeen years. I
</p>
<p>am also a shorthand reporter. I got to the Haymarket meeting, on the 4th
</p>
<p>of May, about half-past seven. I went all around the Haymarket Square
</p>
<p>from Desplaines to Halsted, saw a few people on the street, but no meeting.
</p>
<p>Later on I saw some people going north on Desplaines beyond Randolph.
</p>
<p>I went over there, and in a little while Mr. Spies got up on the wagon and
</p>
<p>said Mr. Fielden and Mr. Parsons were to make a speech, but they hadn't
</p>
<p>come. Spies got down off the wagon and went toward Randolph Street.
</p>
<p>He was gone perhaps five or ten minutes. As he passed me in coming back,
</p>
<p>I asked him if Parsons was going to speak. I understood him to say yes.
</p>
<p>Then he got up on the wagon and said : ' Gentlemen, please come to order.'
</p>
<p>I took shorthand notes of his speech, as much as I could. I had a note-
</p>
<p>book and a short pencil in my overcoat pocket and made notes in the
</p>
<p>pocket. My notes are correct. Some of them I can read, some I can't. I

</p>
<p>don't recollect what he or the others said without my notes.
</p>
<p>" Before Spies commenced to speak somebody in the crowd suggested
</p>
<p>that the meeting should go over to the Haymarket, but Spies said no, that
</p>
<p>the crowd would interfere with the street-cars. Here is what I have of Spies'
</p>
<p>speech :
</p>
<p>" ' Gentlemen and fellow workmen : Mr. Parsons and Mr. Fielden will
</p>
<p>be here in a very short time to address you. I will say, however, first, this
</p>
<p>meeting was called for the purpose of discussing the general situation of the
</p>
<p>eight-hour strike, and the events which have taken place during the last
</p>
<p>forty-eight hours. It seems to have been the opinion of the authorities that
</p>
<p>458 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>this meeting has been called for the purpose of raising a little row and dis-
</p>
<p>turbance. This, however, was not the intention of the committee that
</p>
<p>called the meeting. The committee that called the meeting wanted to tell
</p>
<p>you certain facts of which you are probably aware. The capitalistic press
</p>
<p>has been misleading misrepresenting the cause of labor for the last few
</p>
<p>weeks, so much so' there is something here unintelligible that I can't
</p>
<p>read ; some of it went off on the side of my pocket. The next is : 'When-
</p>
<p>ever strikes have taken place ; whenever people have been driven to violence
</p>
<p>by the oppression of their ' something unintelligible here ' Then the
</p>
<p>police' a few unintelligible words, then there were cheers ' But I want
</p>
<p>to tell you, gentlemen, that these acts of violence are the natural outcome of
</p>
<p>the degradation and subjection to which working people are subjected. I
</p>
<p>was addressing a meeting of ten thousand wage slaves yesterday afternoon
</p>
<p>in the neighborhood of McCormick's. They did not want me to speak.
</p>
<p>The most of them were good church-going people. They didn't want me
</p>
<p>to speak because I was a Socialist. They wanted to tear me down from
</p>
<p>the cars, but I spoke to them and told them they must stick together '
</p>
<p>some more that is unintelligible ' and he would have to submit to them if
</p>
<p>they would stick together.' The next I have is : ' They were not Anarchists,
</p>
<p>but good church-going people they were good Christians. The patrol
</p>
<p>wagons came, and blood was shed.'
</p>
<p>" Some one in the crowd said, ' Shame on them.' The next thing I have
</p>
<p>is : 'Throwing stones at the factory ; most harmless sport.' Then Spies
</p>
<p>said, ' What did the police do ? ' Some one in the crowd said, ' Murdered
</p>
<p>them.' Then he went on : ' They only came to the meeting there as if
</p>
<p>attending church.' . . . 'Such things tell you of the agitation.' . . .
</p>
<p>'Couldn't help themselves any more.' ' It was then when they resorted to
</p>
<p>violence.' . . . ' Before you starve.' . . . ' This fight that is going on now
</p>
<p>is simply a struggle for the existence of the oppressed classes.'
</p>
<p>"My pocket got fuller and fuller of paper ; my notes got more unintel-
</p>
<p>ligible. The meeting seemed to be orderly. I took another position in the
</p>
<p>face of the speaker, took out my paper and reported openly during all the
</p>
<p>rest of the meeting. The balance of my notes I have not got. From what
</p>
<p>appears in my report in the Tribune, I can give you part of what Spies,

<p>Fielden and Parsons said. It is, however, only an abstract of what they
</p>
<p>said. So far as it goes it is verbatim, except the pronouns and the verbs
</p>
<p>are changed.
</p>
<p>"The balance of Spies' speech is as follows (reading) : ' It was said that
</p>
<p>I inspired the attack on McCormick's. That is a lie. The fight is going
</p>
<p>on. Now is the chance to strike for the existence of the oppressed classes.
</p>
<p>The oppressors want us to be content. They will kill us. The thought of
</p>
<p>liberty which inspired your sires to fight for their freedom ought to animate
</p>
<p>you to-day. The day is not far distant when we will resort to hanging these
</p>
<p>men. (Applause and cries of ' Hang them now.') McCormick is the man
</p>
<p>who created the row Monday, and he must be held responsible for the mur-
</p>
<p>der of our brothers. (Cries of ' Hang him.') Don't make any threats,
</p>
<p>they are of no avail. Whenever you get ready to do something, do it, and
</p>
<p>don't make any threats beforehand. There are in the city to-day between
</p>
<p>forty and fifty thousand men locked out because they refuse to obey the
</p>
<p>supreme will or dictation of a small number of men. The families of twenty-
</p>
<p>five or thirty thousand men are starving because their husbands and fathers
</p>
<p>are not men enough to withstand and resist the dictation of a few thieves on

</p>
<p>a grand scale, to put it out of the power of the few men to say whether they
</p>
<p>should work or not. You place your lives, your happiness, everything, out
</p>
<p>of the arbitrary power of a few rascals who have been raised in idleness and
</p>
<p>luxury upon the fruits of your labor. Will you stand that ? (Cries of ' No. ')
</p>
<p>The press say we are Bohemians, Poles, Russians, Germans that there
</p>
<p>are no Americans among us. That is a lie. Every honest American is with
</p>
<p>us ; those who are not are unworthy of their traditions and their forefathers.'
</p>
<p>"Spies spoke fifteen or twenty minutes. What I have given here would
</p>
<p>not represent more than five or six minutes of actual talking.
</p>
<p>" Parsons stated first that the remedy for the wrongs of the workingmen
</p>
<p>was in Socialism ; otherwise they would soon become Chinamen. 'It is time
</p>
<p>to raise a note of warning. There is nothing in the eight-hour movement to
</p>
<p>excite the capitalists. Do you know that the military are under arms, and
</p>
<p>a Gatling gun is ready to mow you down? Is this Germany, Russia or
</p>
<p>Spain ? (A voice : 'It looks like it.') Whenever you make a demand for
</p>
<p>eight hours' pay, an increase of pay, the militia and the deputy sheriffs and
</p>
<p>the Pinkerton men are called out, and you are shot and clubbed and mur-
</p>
<p>dered in the streets. I am not here for the purpose of inciting anybody,
</p>
<p>but to speak out, to tell the facts as they exist, even though it shall cost me
</p>
<p>my life before morning.' Then he spoke about the Cincinnati demonstra-
</p>
<p>tion, and about the rifle guard being needed. Then the report continues :
</p>
<p>' It behooves you, as you love your wives and children, if you don't want to
</p>
<p>see them perish with hunger, killed, or cut down like dogs on the street,
</p>
<p>Americans, in the interest of your liberty and your independence, to arm,
</p>
<p>to arm yourselves. (Applause and cries of ' We will do it, we are ready
</p>
<p>now.') You are not.' Then the rest of it is the wind-up. Besides what I
</p>
<p>have stated above he spoke for a long while about the fact that out of every
</p>
<p>dollar the workingman got fifteen cents, and the capitalists the employers
</p>
<p>got eighty-five cents. When he said, ' To arms, to arms,' he said that in
</p>
<p>his ordinary way of talking. I did not notice any difference in him when he
</p>
<p>said that.
</p>
<p>" The first that I have written out of Fielden's speech is : 'There are pre-
</p>
<p>monitions of danger all know it. The press say the Anarchists will sneak
</p>
<p>away ; we are not going to. If we continue to be robbed it will not be long

</p>
<p>before we will be murdered. There is no security for the working classes
</p>
<p>under the present social system. A few individuals control the means of
</p>
<p>living and hold the workingmen in a vise. Everybody does not know that.
</p>
<p>Those who know it are tired of it, and know the others will get tired of it,
</p>
<p>too. They are determined to end it and will end it, and there is no power
</p>
<p>in the land that will prevent them. Congressman Foran says the laborer
</p>
<p>can get nothing from legislation. He also said that the laborers can get
</p>
<p>some relief from their present condition when the rich man knew it was un-
</p>
<p>safe for him to live in a community where there are dissatisfied workingmen,
</p>
<p>for they would solve the labor problem. I don't know whether you are
</p>
<p>Democrats or Republicans, but whichever you are, you worship at the shrine
</p>
<p>of heaven. John Brown, Jefferson, Washington, Patrick Henry and Hop-
</p>
<p>kins said to the people, " The law is your enemy. " We are rebels against it.
</p>
<p>The law is only framed for those that are your enslavers. (A voice: 'That
</p>
<p>is true.') Men in their blind rage attacked McCormick's factory and were
</p>
<p>shot down by the law in cold blood, in the city of Chicago, in the protection
</p>
<p>of property. Those men were going to do some damage to a certain per-
</p>
<p>son's interest who was a large property-owner ; therefore the law came to his
</p>
<p>460 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>defense ; and when McCormick undertook to do some injury to the interest
</p>
<p>of those who had no property, the law also came to his defense and not to
</p>
<p>the workingman's defense, when he, McCormick, attacked him and his
</p>
<p>living. (Cries of 'No.') There is the difference. The law makes no dis-
</p>
<p>tinctions. A million men hold all the property in this country. The law
</p>
<p>has no use for the other fifty-four millions. (A voice: 'Right enough.')
</p>
<p>You have nothing more to do with the law except to lay hands on it and
</p>
<p>throttle it until it makes its last kick. It turns your brothers out on the
</p>
<p>wayside, and has degraded them until they have lost the last vestige of
</p>
<p>humanity, and they are mere things and animals. Keep your eye upon it,
</p>
<p>throttle it, kill it, stab it, do everything you can to wound it to impede its
</p>
<p>progress. Remember, before trusting them to do anything for yourself,
</p>
<p>prepare to do it yourself. Don't turn over your business to anybody else.
</p>
<p>No'man deserves anything unless he is man enough to make an effort to lift
</p>
<p>himself from oppression.'
</p>
<p>"Then there was an interruption on account of some storm-clouds.
</p>
<p>Everybody started to go away. Mr. Parsons suggested that they adjourn
</p>
<p>over to Zepf's Hall. Fielden said no, the people were trying to get infor-
</p>
<p>mation, and he would go on. And he went on : 'Is it not a fact that we
</p>
<p>have no choice as to our existence, for we can't dictate what our labor is
</p>
<p>worth ? He that has to obey the will of another is a slave. Can we do any-
</p>
<p>thing except by the strong arm of resistance? The Socialists are not going
</p>
<p>to declare war, but I tell you war has been declared upon us ; and I ask you
</p>
<p>to get hold of anything that will help to resist the onslaught of the enemy
</p>
<p>and the usurper. The skirmish lines have met. People have been shot.
</p>
<p>Men, women and children have not been spared by the capitalists and min-
</p>
<p>ions of private capital. It has no mercy so ought you. You are called
</p>
<p>upon to defend yourselves, your lives, your future. What matters it whether
</p>
<p>you kill yourselves with work to get a little relief, or die on the battle-field
</p>
<p>resisting the enemy? What is the difference? Any animal, however loath-
</p>
<p>some, will resist when stepped upon. Are men less than snails or worms ?
</p>
<p>I have some resistance in me ; I know that you have, too. You have been
</p>
<p>robbed, and you will be starved into a worse condition.'
</p>
<p>"That is all I have. At that time some one alongside of me asked if

</p>
<p>the police were coming. I was facing northeast, looked down the street,
</p>
<p>and saw a file of police about the middle of Randolph Street. At once I
</p>
<p>put my paper in my pocket and ran right over to the northwest corner of
</p>
<p>Randolph and Desplaines. Just when I reached the sidewalk, the front
</p>
<p>rank of the police got to the southwest corner of Randolph and Desplaines.
</p>
<p>I stood there until some of the police marched by, and the first thing I
</p>
<p>knew I heard an explosion ; and the next thing there was a volley of fifteen
</p>
<p>or twenty or thirty shots, and I thought it was about time to leave, so I
</p>
<p>skinned down Randolph Street. While I was running I heard a great lot of
</p>
<p>shots, and somebody tumbled right in front of me, but I didn't stop to see
</p>
<p>whether he was hurt. I didn't see who shot first. As to the temper of the
</p>
<p>crowd, it was just an ordinary meeting."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination Mr. English said :
</p>
<p>" It was a peaceable and quiet meeting for an out-door meeting. I
</p>
<p>didn't see any turbulence. I was there all the time. I thought the speeches
</p>
<p>they made that night were a little milder than I had heard them make for
</p>
<p>years. They were all set speeches, about the same thing. I didn't hear
</p>
<p>M. M. THOMPSON'S TESTIMONY. 461
</p>
<p>any of them say or advise that they were going to use force that night.
</p>
<p>Before I went to the meeting my instructions from the Tribune office were
</p>
<p>to take only the most incendiary part of the speeches. I think when Mr.
</p>
<p>Parsons spoke about the Cincinnati meeting he said he had been at Cincin-
</p>
<p>nati and seen the procession. I heard the announcement to the crowd to
</p>
<p>disperse, distinctly. I did not hear Mr. Fielden say: 'There come the
</p>
<p>bloodhounds now ; you do your duty and I'll do mine.' I heard nothing of
</p>
<p>that import at all."
</p>
<p>M. M. THOMPSON testified :
</p>
<p>" I am at present employed in the dry-goods business of Marshall Field
</p>
<p>& Co. Prior to the 4th of May last I was running a grocery store at 108
</p>
<p>South Desplaines. I was at the Haymarket Square on the evening of May
</p>
<p>4th. I walked west on Randolph Street about half past seven o'clock, and
</p>
<p>somebody handed me a circular headed ' Revenge,' and signed ' Your Broth-
</p>
<p>ers.' About twenty-five minutes to eight I got to the corner of Desplaines
</p>
<p>and Randolph. I met Mr. Brazletori of the Inter-Ocean. We talked about
</p>
<p>fifteen minutes. I asked the time. It was ten minutes of eight. Brazleton
</p>
<p>pointed out to me Mr. Schwab, who came rushing along Desplaines Street
</p>
<p>in a great hurry. I then went over to the east side of Desplaines Street. I
</p>
<p>walked up Desplaines Street near the corner of Lake, and came back again
</p>
<p>to the alley back of Crane Bros', and stood just back of that alley. Then I
</p>
<p>saw Spies get up on the wagon and he asked for Parsons. Parsons didn't
</p>
<p>respond. He then got down, and. Schwab and Spies walked into that alley
</p>
<p>at Crane Bros'., near which the wagon was situated. The first word I heard
</p>
<p>between Schwab and Spies was 'pistols;' the next word was 'police.' I
</p>
<p>think I heard ' police ' twice, or ' pistols ' twice. I then walked just a little
</p>
<p>nearer the edge of the alley, and just then Spies said : ' Do you think one is
</p>
<p>enough, or hadn't we better go and get more ? ' I could hear no answer to
</p>
<p>that. They then walked out of the alley and south on Desplaines Street,
</p>
<p>and west on the north side of Randolph to Halsted, and cut across the
</p>
<p>street and went over to the southwest corner ; they were there about three
</p>
<p>minutes, came out of that crowd again and came back. On the way back,
</p>
<p>as they neared Union Street, I heard the word ' police ' again. Just then I
</p>
<p>went past them, and Schwab said : ' Now, if they come, we will give it to

</p>
<p>them. ' Spies replied he thought they were afraid to bother with them.
</p>
<p>They came on, and before they got up near the wagon they met a third
</p>
<p>party, and they bunched right together there, south of the alley, and ap-
</p>
<p>peared to get right in a huddle ; and there was something passed between
</p>
<p>Spies and the third man what it was I could not say. This here (indi-
</p>
<p>cating picture of Schnaubelt, heretofore identified) is, I think, the third
</p>
<p>man ; I think his beard was a little longer than in this picture ; this is the
</p>
<p>picture of the third man. I saw the third man on the wagon afterwards.
</p>
<p>Whatever it was that Spies gave him, he stuck it in his pocket on the right-
</p>
<p>hand side. Spies got up on the wagon, and I think that third man got up
</p>
<p>right after him. I noticed him afterwards sitting on the wagon, and that he
</p>
<p>kept his hands in his pockets. I stayed there until Mr. Fielden commenced
</p>
<p>to speak ; then I left.
</p>
<p>On cross-examination Thompson said :
</p>
<p>" My grocery store was closed by the Sheriff under an execution. I
</p>
<p>worked for Marshall Field before. I had never seen any of the defendants,
</p>
<p>462 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>to my knowledge, before that night, in my life. When I saw Spies and
</p>
<p>Schwab go into the alley, there was a crowd there. I was standing right
</p>
<p>near the alley, or alongside north of it, up against the building. I couldn't
</p>
<p>see down the alley unless I turned my face to it. The first time I had ever
</p>
<p>seen Spies was when he got up on the wagon. Spies got out of the wagon
</p>
<p>and went into Crane's alley with Schwab. I was right around the corner
</p>
<p>of the alley within three feet probably at the farthest, and I moved down
</p>
<p>to within half a foot. I did not look down the alley, only when they came
</p>
<p>out of the alley I did look. The conversation between Spies and Schwab
</p>
<p>was in English. I don't understand German. I didn't hear any words
</p>
<p>between 'police' and 'pistols.' They were in there probably two or three
</p>
<p>minutes. When I drew up within a foot of the alley, I heard : ' Do you
</p>
<p>think one enough, or had we better go for more ? ' Going up Randolph
</p>
<p>Street, I heard some words spoken in German between them, but not in
</p>
<p>the conversation at the alley. I cannot say that I knew Mr. Schwab's voice
</p>
<p>at that time. I only knew Mr. Spies' voice from what I heard him ask on
</p>
<p>the wagon. Spies was the one who used the words 'pistols' and 'police.'
</p>
<p>I did not see him when he said it. I could not see him without putting my
</p>
<p>head around the corner. They went out of my sight when they went into
</p>
<p>the alley. The whole conversation was done in three minutes, I should judge.
</p>
<p>The first remark that I heard was about a minute and a half after they
</p>
<p>went into the alley and went out of sight. When they came out and walked
</p>
<p>south on Desplaines I followed them within a few feet. It was then about
</p>
<p>a quarter past eight. They walked west on Randolph Street to Halsted,
</p>
<p>and I trailed after them all the time, part of the time beside them, part
</p>
<p>of the time ahead, and past them, but all the time close to them. When
</p>
<p>they came to Halsted there were a few people there, not much of a crowd.
</p>
<p>I was still tagging after them with no other object than looking for the meet-
</p>
<p>ing, to find where the audience was assembled. I don't know whether they
</p>
<p>saw me ; there was nothing whatever to prevent their seeing me. When
</p>
<p>they were going west I couldn't hear a word of what they did say. The
</p>
<p>street lamps were lighted. When they got down on Halsted there was a
</p>
<p>crowd, of about twenty-five people. They were right in the thickest of the
</p>
<p>crowd, and I stood on the sidewelk, about ten feet from them. I didn't

</p>
<p>hear either of them say a word. Then they went back east on Randolph
</p>
<p>Street. I was about six feet behind them. They said nothing. There was
</p>
<p>nobody else following them besides me. I couldn't hear what they said
</p>
<p>until they came to Union Street. Then I got past them. It was light at
</p>
<p>the time ; they could see me. Near Union Street Schwab said : ' Now, if
</p>
<p>they come, we will give it to them,' and Spies said he did not think they
</p>
<p>would bother them, because they were afraid. This conversation was
</p>
<p>carried on in the English language. I was behind them when I heard the
</p>
<p>first of it, but they kind of slackened, and I got by them. I was making my
</p>
<p>gait quicker to get by them. Schwab finished his remark when I got about
</p>
<p>three feet by them. Schwab made his remark in an ordinary tone of street
</p>
<p>conversation, loud enough for me to hear. I heard no more conversation
</p>
<p>between Schwab and Spies. I testified before the Coroner's jury. I testi-
</p>
<p>fied to this conversation at Union Street. If I didn't, it was an oversight
</p>
<p>on my part, or it was because nobody asked me any question, but I say
</p>
<p>that I did say that before the Coroner's inquest.
</p>
<p>" Coming back, I stopped on the northwest corner of Randolph and
</p>
<p>Desplaines. I was then about ten or fifteen feet ahead of Spies and
</p>
<p>A FATAL CONVERSATION. 463
</p>
<p>Schwab. They came up. I can't say that they were talking. They went
</p>
<p>right through the street, moving diagonally to the wagon. I staid at the
</p>
<p>corner. I did not go after them until they got onto the wagon. That was
</p>
<p>the last time that I saw Schwab. I saw Spies when he got up to make a
</p>
<p>speech. Oh, no, that wasn't the last time that I saw Schwab that night.
</p>
<p>That was the last time that I saw him until they were out of sight and the
</p>
<p>third man met them. When they started from the corner northeast across
</p>
<p>the street, I stood at the corner just to let them cross the street. Then I
</p>
<p>started after them. They did not get out of my sight. I didn't catch up
</p>
<p>with them at all. When I got within eight or ten feet of them they were
</p>
<p>standing on the sidewalk. They stopped right there, about five feet south
</p>
<p>of the south line of Crane's alley. There wasn't probably more than half a
</p>
<p>dozen people on the east side of the street. There were a good many people
</p>
<p>on the West Side. It was then about twenty or twenty-five minutes past
</p>
<p>eight. When I got up within eight or ten feet of them and they stopped, I
</p>
<p>stopped too, and looked at them. They were in plain view of me. I don't
</p>
<p>think they did see me, though they could see me if they looked up. I think
</p>
<p>there are some electric lights near there, on the Lyceum building. I was
</p>
<p>between them and the electric light. When they stopped there, the next
</p>
<p>thing was that they met that third man. I had never seen that third man
</p>
<p>before. I have seen this picture of Schnaubelt before ; I think Mr. Furth-
</p>
<p>mann showed it to me about a week ago. That third party came from the
</p>
<p>east. He must have been standing up against the house, and he walked
</p>
<p>west to the front of the sidewalk. Schnaubelt was not facing me ; he had
</p>
<p>his back to me. They did not go into the alley. One had his back south,
</p>
<p>one east, and Spies had his back north. I didn't hear what they were talk-
</p>
<p>ing about. I was on the sidewalk near the curb-stone, partly south, not
</p>
<p>directly south of them. Spies stood directly to the north, which would
</p>
<p>bring his back to me. I don't know but what he did see me. They stood
</p>
<p>there about thirty seconds. I didn't hear a word. Spies handed that third
</p>
<p>man something, who put it into his pocket, and Spies got up on the wagon
</p>
<p>and made a speech. I did not see Schwab on the wagon. Spies got right
</p>
<p>up on the wagon and commenced to speak, but one or two minutes elapsed
</p>
<p>in the time."

<p>AUGUST HUEN, a printer in the employ of Wehrer & Klein, set up the
</p>
<p>German part of the circular headed "Attention, Workingmen ! " and testi-
</p>
<p>fied that the last line read, "Workingmen, arm yourselves and appear in
</p>
<p>full force." Mr. Fischer wrote it. On cross-examination, he testified that
</p>
<p>an hour after the form had been given to the pressman the last line was
</p>
<p>taken out.
</p>
<p>HUGH HUME, a reporter for the Inter-Ocean, testified :
</p>
<p>" I saw Mr. Fielden and other defendants in the sweat-box that is, the
</p>
<p>cells down-stairs at the Central Station, about midnight, between the 5th
</p>
<p>and 6th of May last. I had a conversation with Spies. He said he had
</p>
<p>been at the Haymarket meeting. He had gone up there to refute the state-
</p>
<p>ments, of the capitalistic press in regard to what he had said at McCor-
</p>
<p>mick's. Up at McCormick's he had been talking to a lot of people whom
</p>
<p>he could not influence all good Catholics. During his speech on the
</p>
<p>Haymarket, some people had shown a disposition to hang McCormick.
</p>
<p>He had told them not to make any threats of that kind. He had said,
</p>
<p>464 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>'When you want to do a thing of that kind, don't talk so much about it,
</p>
<p>but go out and do it.' He then said to me that the people had reached a
</p>
<p>condition where they were willing to do any violence, and he had advocated
</p>
<p>violence of that kind. It was necessary to bring about the revolution that
</p>
<p>the Socialists wanted. He said he had advocated the use of dynamite. I
</p>
<p>asked him if he was in favor of killing police officers with dynamite. He
</p>
<p>hesitated a little, and then said the police represented the capitalists and
</p>
<p>were enemies of theirs, and when you have an enemy he has got to be
</p>
<p>removed. That is the gist of what he said. Spies said he didn't know
</p>
<p>anything about the bomb being exploded until afterwards. He had heard
</p>
<p>a noise that resembled the sound of a cannon, and thought the police were
</p>
<p>firing over the heads of the people to frighten them. He said he consid-
</p>
<p>ered all laws as things you could get along without ; they were inimical to
</p>
<p>the best interests of the people and of the social growth. He did not think
</p>
<p>that dynamite was in his office when he left it, and had an idea that the
</p>
<p>police put that dynamite there to get a case on him.
</p>
<p>" I had a little talk with Mr. Fielden. He was suffering somewhat from
</p>
<p>his wound. When I asked him how the Haymarket affair accorded with
</p>
<p>his ideas of Socialism, he said, 'You are on dangerous ground now. There
</p>
<p>is an argument, though, that we have, that is to the effect that if you cannot
</p>
<p>do a thing peaceably, it has got to be done by force.' Something to that
</p>
<p>effect ; I don't remember the language. Fielden said, as to the number of
</p>
<p>Socialists in Chicago, that there were a number of groups here, contain-
</p>
<p>ing 250 men. Those were recognized Socialists, but they had people from
</p>
<p>all over the city, from nearly every wholesale house ; but those people are
</p>
<p>afraid to come out yet, only awaiting an opportunity. He spoke about the
</p>
<p>decision of the Supreme Court prohibiting military companies from march-
</p>
<p>ing around with arms. He was inclined to think that the decision was not
</p>
<p>right.
</p>
<p>"I had a short interview with Schwab. All he had to say was that
</p>
<p>Socialism was right, even with the blood shed at the Haymarket."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination Mr. Hume said that Spies saw him write down
</p>
<p>answers to the questions and knew that he wanted the interview for publi-
</p>
<p>cation.

<p>HARRY L. GILMER proved a strong witness and testified as follows :
</p>
<p>" I am a painter by trade. Reside at 50 North Ann Street. On the
</p>
<p>evening of May 4 last, I was at the Haymarket meeting on Desplaines
</p>
<p>Street. I got there about a quarter to ten o'clock. In going home, when
</p>
<p>I got to the corner of Randolph and Desplaines Streets, I saw a crowd over
</p>
<p>there, and went up to where the speaking was going on, on the east side of
</p>
<p>Desplaines Street. I saw the wagon ; did not pay particular attention to
</p>
<p>the speaking. I stood near the lamp-post on the corner of Crane Bros',
</p>
<p>alley, between the lamp-post and the wagon, and up near the east end of
</p>
<p>the wagon for a few minutes. The gentleman here (pointing to Fielden)
</p>
<p>was speaking when I came there. I staid around there a few minutes,
</p>
<p>was looking for a party whom I expected to find there, and stepped back
</p>
<p>into the alley between Crane Bros', building and the building immediately
</p>
<p>south of it. The alley was south of the wagon. I was standing in the
</p>
<p>alley looking around for a few minutes ; noticed parties in conversation,
</p>
<p>right across the alley, on the south side of the alley. Somebody in front of
</p>
<p>HARRY L. GILMERS EVIDENCE. 465
</p>
<p>me on the edge of the sidewalk said, ' Here comes the police.' There was
</p>
<p>a sort of rush to see the police come up. There was a man came from the
</p>
<p>wagon down to the parties that were standing on the south side of the
</p>
<p>alley. He lit a match and touched it off, something or another the fuse
</p>
<p>commenced to fizzle, and he give a couple of steps forward, and tossed it
</p>
<p>over into the street. He was standing in this direction (illustrating). The
</p>
<p>man that .lit the match on this side of him, and two or three of them stood
</p>
<p>together, and he turned around with it in his hand, took two or three steps
</p>
<p>that way, and tossed it that way, over into the street. I knew the man by
</p>
<p>sight who threw that fizzing thing into the street. I have seen him several
</p>
<p>times at meetings at one place and another in the city. I do not know
</p>
<p>his name. He was a man about five feet ten inches high, somewhat full-
</p>
<p>chested, and had a light sandy beard, not very long. He was full-faced,
</p>
<p>his eyes set somewhat back in his head. Judging from his appearance, he
</p>
<p>would probably weigh 180 pounds. My impression is his hat was dart
</p>
<p>brown or black ; I don't know whether it was a soft hat, a felt hat or a stifl
</p>
<p>hat. This here (indicating photograph of Schnaubelt heretofore identified)
</p>
<p>is the man that threw the bomb out of the alley. There were four or five
</p>
<p>standing together in the group. This here (pointing to Spies) is the man
</p>
<p>who came from the wagon toward the group.
</p>
<p>" I did not see the police myself, there were so many people between
</p>
<p>me and them. I don't recollect any declaration from any of the police offi-
</p>
<p>cers about this person nothing distinctly, anyway. That man over there
</p>
<p>(pointing at defendant Fischer) was one of the parties. After the bomb
</p>
<p>was thrown these parties immediately left through the alley. I stood
</p>
<p>there. The firing commenced immediately afterwards, and my attention
</p>
<p>was attracted by the firing, and I paid more attention to that than any-
</p>
<p>thing else."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination Gilmer testified to having resided formerly in Deg
</p>
<p>Moines, Iowa, Fort Dodge, Iowa, Kansas City, Mo., and in various locali-
</p>
<p>ties in Chicago. He then proceeded as follows :
</p>
<p>" I know the Coroner's jury was investigating the matter. I saw an
</p>
<p>account of the investigation of the grand jury in the paper. I first told a
</p>
<p>man by the name of Allen and another party whom I don't know, and a

</p>
<p>reporter of the Times, that I saw the match lighted, and saw the man who
</p>
<p>threw the bomb. I think that it was two or three days after the 4th of May.
</p>
<p>A number of people were talking the matter over on the west side of the
</p>
<p>City Hall, on La Salle Street, and I made the remark that I believed if I
</p>
<p>ever saw the party who threw the bomb I could identify him. They didn't
</p>
<p>ask me why I made that remark. I don't think they asked me any ques-
</p>
<p>tions, what I knew about the matter. The reporter afterwards told me he
</p>
<p>had heard the remark. I think that was on the 6th of May. On May 5th,
</p>
<p>I was working on the corner of Twentieth Street and Wabash Avenue. On
</p>
<p>the 6th of May I went down to 88 La Salle Street to collect a bill. I went
</p>
<p>across the street, and there had the conversation with the reporter aod
</p>
<p>the others. That night I had a note left at my room for me to come dnwn
</p>
<p>to the Central Station. The name of James Bonfield was signed to the
</p>
<p>note. I went to the Central Station and had a conversation with Mr. Bon-
</p>
<p>field the next day ; I couldn't tell exactly whether on the 6th or the yth. I
</p>
<p>made my statement to Mr. Bonfield. I never appeared before a Coroner's
</p>
<p>466 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>jury ; was never subpoenaed to appear before any Coroner's jury that exam-
</p>
<p>ined any of the dead policemen. I was at the Haymarket meeting about
</p>
<p>fifteen minutes from the time I got there to the explosion of the bomb. I
</p>
<p>was looking for a person who had told me he was going to the meeting.
</p>
<p>I kept looking through the crowd to see if I could find him. Fielden was
</p>
<p>speaking then. I don't remember anything of his speech, except that he
</p>
<p>made use of the word McCormick. Before I went down-town I had read
</p>
<p>in the paper that there had been a riot at McCormick's the day before, and
</p>
<p>that the police had shot some men. I was in the neighborhood of where
</p>
<p>Fielden talked for about fifteen minutes. I don't remember anything about
</p>
<p>the connection in which Fielden spoke of McCormick. I was looking for a
</p>
<p>gentleman by the name of Richard Roe, and didn't pay any attention to
</p>
<p>what Fielden said. When I stepped into the alley I think I was on the
</p>
<p>north side of the alley, about eight feet from the corner of Crane's building.
</p>
<p>That group of men was right across the alley on the south side. The lamp
</p>
<p>was burning on the corner of the alley at that time, and it shone right
</p>
<p>down. I could see the persons in that party distinctly; could see their
</p>
<p>countenances ; they could see myself. They were also about eight or nine
</p>
<p>feet from the mouth of the alley. I could hear them talk. They spoke
</p>
<p>German. I didn't understand them. Before the man came from the wagon
</p>
<p>I stepped across the alley and was standing on the north side of the alley,
</p>
<p>perhaps three or four feet to the east of that group, so that I was standing
</p>
<p>about twelve or fourteen feet from the mouth of Crane's alley. I did not
</p>
<p>say that I saw the wagon from that point. I could just see the hind end of
</p>
<p>the wagon from where I stood when I went through the alley. I think there
</p>
<p>was a tail-board. The edges of the box of the wagon were perhaps ten
</p>
<p>inches high. I don't know whether there were side-boards on that wagon
</p>
<p>or not ; I could not say positively as to the width of the side-boards on the
</p>
<p>wagon. They might have been higher than ten inches. I am sure there
</p>
<p>was a box of some kind on the wagon. My impression is it was a wagon
</p>
<p>about twelve or thirteen feet long, with low side-boards on. I didn't see
</p>
<p>anybody get off of the wagon after I went in the alley. I did not say
</p>
<p>Mr. Spies got down off the wagon. I said .he came from towards the wagon.
</p>
<p>I saw him standing on the sidewalk before I went in the alley. I did not

</p>
<p>say I saw Spies in the wagon at all. Mr. Spies is the man that came down
</p>
<p>in the alley and lighted the bomb, to the best of my recollection. When I
</p>
<p>saw him standing on the sidewalk he was talking with somebody. I would
</p>
<p>be inclined to think it was this gentleman here (indicating Schwab). I
</p>
<p>could not say for sure. I think it was a dark-complexioned man. My
</p>
<p>impression is it might be him. I have very little doubt but Fischer is the
</p>
<p>man I saw in the group. I am very nearly as positive that Fischer is the
</p>
<p>man as I am that the picture is the picture of the man who threw the bomb.
</p>
<p>I am sure Fischer is the man. I think I saw Mr. Parsons there that night
</p>
<p>talking to some ladies. I had been down to the Palmer House that evening
</p>
<p>to see some gentlemen from Des Moines that I understood were in the city.
</p>
<p>One of them 'was Judge Cole, another was ex-Gov. Samuel Merrill. I
</p>
<p>didn't find either of them there. I went to the meeting, as I thought I
</p>
<p>would meet Mr. Roe, and we would go home together. That was the only
</p>
<p>business I had with Mr. Roe. It would have been eight or nine blocks
</p>
<p>from the Haymarket to where I lived.
</p>
<p>"I did not run at the time of the shooting. I did not move at all. I
</p>
<p>stood right at the mouth of the alley. After it was all over I backed out
</p>
<p>GILMERS CROSS-EXAMINATION. 467
</p>
<p>the alley, took a car and went home. There were no bullets coming in
</p>
<p>around my locality in the alley. On the street-car on my way home I didn't
</p>
<p>talk with anybody about the occurrence. There were quite a number of
</p>
<p>people in the car talking about the Haymarket occurrence, and there was
</p>
<p>considerable excitement in the car on account of it. The next morning I
</p>
<p>went down on the Wabash Avenue car to the corner of Twentieth Street
</p>
<p>and Wabash Avenue.
</p>
<p>" I heard people speak about the Haymarket affair in the restaurant, on
</p>
<p>Madison Street, where I took my breakfast. I did not say to them any-
</p>
<p>thing about my seeing the match lighted and the bomb thrown. I bought
</p>
<p>the News on the car. I think I was working for Frank Crandle that day;
</p>
<p>to the best of my recollection, there was only one man working with me on
</p>
<p>the job. We worked alongside of each other some time. Talked about
</p>
<p>different things, about our business. I did not say to him that I saw the
</p>
<p>bomb thrown, nor that I saw the man light the match that lit the bomb.
</p>
<p>I told him I had been at the Haymarket and spoke of the Haymarket riot,
</p>
<p>and I think I said there were a number killed or wounded. In the evening
</p>
<p>I went home on the Wabash Avenue car. People were speaking about the
</p>
<p>Haymarket meeting in the car. I didn't tell them I knew anything about
</p>
<p>it. I think I got home about half past six. I had no conversation with the
</p>
<p>landlady. After my supper, my impression is I went to Mr. Roe's house.
</p>
<p>He was not at home. I stayed there about fifteen minutes talking with Mrs.
</p>
<p>Roe. Her daughter, about twelve or thirteen years old, was present during
</p>
<p>the conversation. We talked about the Haymarket meeting. I told her I
</p>
<p>was there. She said she would not let Mr. Roe go to the meeting. I did
</p>
<p>not tell her nor anybody on that occasion that I saw the bomb lighted and
</p>
<p>thrown. Since noon adjournment I had no talk with James Bonfield."
</p>
<p>"Were not you just now walking back and forth in the corridor with
</p>
<p>him?"
</p>
<p>'I did not have no "
</p>
<p>' Didn't you walk back and forth ? "
</p>
<p>'Yes, sir."
</p>
<p>'You were talking to him ?"
</p>
<p>'Yes, sir."

<p>'When I was at Central Station, I think, both Inspector Bonfield and
</p>
<p>Lieut. Kipley were present when I made the statement that I could
</p>
<p>recognize the man, if I ever saw him again, who threw the bomb.
</p>
<p>Afterwards I told all the details to Mr. Grinnell. I explained matters
</p>
<p>more to him than to anybody else. I would not be positive that I told Mr.
</p>
<p>Bonfield I saw the man light the match. I gave a description of the man
</p>
<p>that I saw throw the bomb. I think the man had a black or blue sack
</p>
<p>coat on. I think he had black eyes, and somewhat light whiskers. The
</p>
<p>bomb went in a westerly direction. I have seen Mr. Spies the last year
</p>
<p>and a half, and knew him by sight, not by name. I heard him speak at
</p>
<p>public meetings, seen him very frequently, but never knew his name. I
</p>
<p>heard him once on Market Street, a year ago last spring. I did not inquire
</p>
<p>who it was that spoke. I knew from hearing him and reading the papers
</p>
<p>that Spies was one of the speakers. I frequently heard the name of
</p>
<p>August Spies. At the time I had the conversation with Bonfield I
</p>
<p>described to him as well as I could the man that struck the match and
</p>
<p>lighted the fuse. It was either Bonfield or one of the officers in the
</p>
<p>Central Station. They were all together. I was twice over at police
</p>
<p>468 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>headquarters. This picture here (photograph of Schnaubelt) was shown to
</p>
<p>me first some time last week, at the State's Attorney's office. I was in the
</p>
<p>city during the time the Coroner's jury was examining into the cause of
</p>
<p>the death of different policemen, and at the time the grand jury was exam-
</p>
<p>ining into this case. The officers knew my name and address. They
</p>
<p>never called on me to go before the grand jury or the Coroner's jury.
</p>
<p>" The man who threw the bomb was about five feet and eight, ten or
</p>
<p>nine inches high. I don't think he was a man over six feet tall. The first
</p>
<p>time I told Mr. Grinnell of my experience at the Haymarket was when I
</p>
<p>made my second visit to the Central Station, on Sunday after the Hay-
</p>
<p>market meeting. I think at that time I only told Mr. Grinnell that I could
</p>
<p>identify the person that threw the bomb, if I saw him. I think I told him
</p>
<p>at that time that I saw one man strike a match and light the fuse, and
</p>
<p>another man throw the bomb. Mr. Fischer was brought in while we had
</p>
<p>the conversation at the Central Station. I looked at him. I said nothing
</p>
<p>about his being the man that struck the match. I knew him by sight. I
</p>
<p>identified him as being one of the men who composed the group in
</p>
<p>the alley.
</p>
<p>" I received some money two or three times when I have been over
</p>
<p>here from Mr. James Bonfield ten or fifteen cents, sometimes a quarter.
</p>
<p>At the conversation at Central Station I was not told that I was wanted as
</p>
<p>a witness before the grand jury. I saw the picture of Rudolph Schnaubelt
</p>
<p>about six weeks ago, when Mr. Grinnell sent for me. I did not tell any
</p>
<p>person at any time, except the officers that I mentioned, that I saw the act
</p>
<p>of lighting the bomb accomplished. Neither Mr. Grinnell nor Bonfield, nor
</p>
<p>any other officer, told me to keep silent in regard to the matter.
</p>
<p>" I am six feet three in height. I could pretty near see right over the
</p>
<p>head of the fellow who threw the bomb. When I gave a description of the
</p>
<p>man who came from the wagon and lighted the match that lit the fuse they
</p>
<p>did not bring out Mr. Spies for me to look at. Spies had kind of dark
</p>
<p>clothes on that night. His hat was black or brown. My impression is
</p>
<p>it was a limber-rimmed hat. I first told Mr. Grinnell one day last week
</p>
<p>that this is the man that struck the match, when I saw him sitting here in
</p>
<p>court. I think Mr. Fischer had on a blue sack-coat that night. I think

</p>
<p>he had a black necktie. If Schnaubelt had any necktie that night it
</p>
<p>was a very light one. Spies had a turn-down collar that night and not any
</p>
<p>necktie. I think the upper buttons of Mr. Schnaubelt's coat were
</p>
<p>buttoned. I think Spies had one or two buttons of his coat buttoned up
</p>
<p>when he came from the wagon into the alley."
</p>
<p>MARTIN QUINN was recalled and testified to finding, at Engel's house,
</p>
<p>a machine for making bombs.
</p>
<p>"Engel said it had been left there by some man about four or five
</p>
<p>months previous to that time. Mrs. Engel gave a description of the man
</p>
<p>who left the machine down at the basement door, as a man with long black
</p>
<p>whiskers and pretty tall. Mr. Engel said he thought he knew the man,
</p>
<p>and he thought the machine was made for the purpose of making bombs.
</p>
<p>There had been a meeting at Turner Hall, where this man had made a
</p>
<p>speech about the manufacture of bombs, and the next thing was, this
</p>
<p>machine was brought over, and Engel had said to him he wouldn't allow
</p>
<p>him to make any bombs in his basement; so the man went away. Engel
</p>
<p>didn't know where he was."

</p>
<p>469
</p>
<p>JOHN BONFIELD was recalled and testified to being at the Central
</p>
<p>Station when Officer Quinn brought Engel and the machine there. Bon-
</p>
<p>field, being asked by State's Attorney Grinnell to explain the purpose of
</p>
<p>the apparatus, said :
</p>
<p>" This is a blast furnace in miniature a home-made one. This upright
</p>
<p>part could be lined with fire-clay. This shoulder, some two and a half
</p>
<p>inches from the bottom, could be filled in around with clay, leaving the
</p>
<p>holes open. This, in a blasting furnace, would be known as a tweer. It is
</p>
<p>filled up to a considerable height with clay to protect it from the hot fire
</p>
<p>inside, and the pressure of air is applied through those pipes, one or both
</p>
<p>of them, as may be necessary. When the fire is extinguished or removed,
</p>
<p>the debris or slag that comes from the metal, and the ashes and cinders
</p>
<p>from the material used for fuel, can be taken out
</p>
<p>through the trap at the bottom. The spout is
</p>
<p>for the purpose of passing out the melted metal.
</p>
<p>It is stopped with a plug of clay, and when the
</p>
<p>plug is removed the metal is poured through that
</p>
<p>tube."
</p>
<p>Louis MAHLENDORF testified as follows :
</p>
<p>"I am a tinner by trade, at 292 Milwaukee
</p>
<p>Avenue, since two years. I know the defendant
</p>
<p>Engel since about eight years. I made this ma-
</p>
<p>chine (referring to blasting-machine) for Engel
</p>
<p>over a year ago. I cut off the iron and formed
</p>
<p>it up. Another gentleman, a kind of heavy-set
</p>
<p>man with long beard, was with him when he
</p>
<p>ordered it. Mr. Engel waited for it. He took
</p>
<p>it away with him."
</p>
<p>HERMANN SCHUETTLER, a detective connected
</p>
<p>with the East Chicago Avenue Station, gave the
</p>
<p>facts with reference to his arrest of Lingg, and
</p>
<p>his search of the room on Sedgwick Street, with
</p>
<p>Officers Stift, Loewenstein and Whalen :

<p>"We searched a trunk and found a round
</p>
<p>lead bomb in a stocking. The trunk was in the
</p>
<p>southeast room. In another stocking I found ENGEL ' S BLAST FURNACE.
</p>
<p>a large navy revolver. Both revolver and bomb >m a phot g ra P h -
</p>
<p>were loaded. I turned them over to Capt. Schaack. We found a ladle
</p>
<p>and some tools, a cold chisel and other articles. This here (indicating) is
</p>
<p>the trunk I found in the room. The letters ' L. L. ' were on it at the time.
</p>
<p>I recollect a round porcelain-lined blue cup made out of china that I found,
</p>
<p>and I believe a file. In the closet underneath the baseboard we found a
</p>
<p>lot of torn-off plaster. The lathing was sawed so you could get your hand
</p>
<p>between the floor and the bottom of the laths underneath. I saw those
</p>
<p>lead pipes (indicating) lying between the house Lingg lived in and the next
</p>
<p>house to it, in a small gangway. On the way to the Chicago Avenue Station
</p>
<p>I asked Lingg why he wanted to kill me. He said : ' Personally, I have
</p>
<p>nothing against you, but if I had killed you and your partner I would have
</p>
<p>470 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>been satisfied. I would have killed myself if I had got away with you and
</p>
<p>your partner."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination witness stated that he had had no search warrant
</p>
<p>for going through Lingg's trunk.
</p>
<p>JACOB LOEWENSTEIN, another detective connected with the same station,
</p>
<p>testified to assisting Schuettler in arresting Lingg and that after they had
</p>
<p>vanquished him Lingg said several times: " Shoot me right here, before I
</p>
<p>will go with you. Kill me !" Witness further stated :
</p>
<p>"I was with Officers Whalen, Stift, Schuettler, Cushman and McCor-
</p>
<p>mick, at Lingg's room, on May 7, between ten and eleven o'clock. Nobody
</p>
<p>was in the house. The door was locked. Finally we pushed in the door
</p>
<p>and went in. In a little bed-room in the southeast corner of the house there
</p>
<p>was a bed and a wash-stand and a trunk, and a little shelf up in the corner
</p>
<p>with some bottles on it. In the closet there were some shells, and some
</p>
<p>loaded cartridges, and on the floor some metal and some lead. Those here
</p>
<p>(indicating box containing shells) are the shells I found in the closet of
</p>
<p>Lingg's room. I found those bolts (indicating) in the wash-stand. This
</p>
<p>metal here (indicating) I found in a dinner-box with some loaded dynamite
</p>
<p>bombs in the trunk. There were four bombs in this box (indicating), gas-
</p>
<p>pipe bombs. The two in the bottom were loaded. When I first opened
</p>
<p>the trunk this cover (indicating) dropped down, and with this Remington
</p>
<p>rifle (indicating), which was loaded, fell down. I found a lot of papers and
</p>
<p>books in the top of the trunk. In a gray stocking I found this round dyna-
</p>
<p>mite bomb, loaded (indicating). I found two pieces of solder in that
</p>
<p>dinner-box. I found a blast hammer and one smaller hammer, a couple of
</p>
<p>iron bits and drills, a two-quart pail, with a little substance looking like
</p>
<p>saw-dust in the' bottom of it, which I found out to be dynamite. I found a
</p>
<p>little tin quart basin under the bed with a little piece of fuse in it. In the
</p>
<p>bottom of the trunk I found two or three pieces of fuse. In the closet we
</p>
<p>tore off the baseboard, which had been freshly nailed down the nails
</p>
<p>were projecting out a little bit and found the plaster was torn out all the
</p>
<p>way around on the baseboard, and there were holes there."

<p>and John K. Seller, a police officer at the last-named station, testified to a
</p>
<p>call for a patrol wagon and its leaving at 10:40 o'clock for Desplaines and
</p>
<p>Randolph Streets with a full load of officers.
</p>
<p>JOHN B. MURPHY, a physician and surgeon, was called to the Desplaines
</p>
<p>Street Station after the Haymarket explosion and remained until three
</p>
<p>o'clock in the morning. He was a surgeon at the Cook County Hospital,
</p>
<p>and when he left the station he proceeded direct to that institution. At the
</p>
<p>station Dr. Murphy said that he first dressed Barrett, who was complain-
</p>
<p>ing and crying with severe pain.
</p>
<p>" He had a very large wound in his side, large enough to admit two fin-
</p>
<p>gers right into his liver, and severely bleeding. I could not reach with my
</p>
<p>finger the piece of shell that caused the injury. It was a lacerated wound,
</p>
<p>much larger than could be made by an ordinary pistol bullet. I tampened
</p>
<p>THE AUTHOR ON THE STAND. 471
</p>
<p>the liver with gauze to prevent his bleeding to death at the station, and I
</p>
<p>went on to other officers in that way until I dressed in all between twenty-
</p>
<p>six and thirty at the station. When we got through with that, at three
</p>
<p>o'clock, Dr. Lee remained at the station while I went to the hospital to take
</p>
<p>care of those injured most severely, who were to be sent to the hospital.
</p>
<p>Officers Muller, Whitney, Keller, Barrett, Flavin and Redden are the prin-
</p>
<p>cipal men that I ordered him to send first to the hospital."
</p>
<p>Dr. Murphy then gave a list of the men and specified the particular
</p>
<p>character of their wounds.
</p>
<p>E. G. EPLER, a physician and surgeon practicing at No. 505 South
</p>
<p>Canal Street, testified to having dressed a wound of Fielden between eleven
</p>
<p>and twelve at night on May 4.
</p>
<p>"The wound was on the left side of the left knee joint, the bullet having
</p>
<p>passed in underneath the skin and passed out again five inches from the
</p>
<p>point of entry. He said he was crawling on the pavement trying to get
</p>
<p>away from the crowd when he received the injury, and the bullet glanced
</p>
<p>off from the pavement and struck him in that position."
</p>
<p>MICHAEL HOFFMAN, a detective connected with the Larrabee Street Sta-
</p>
<p>tion, gave evidence as to finding nine round bombs and four long ones.
</p>
<p>"These two bombs (indicating) I found at the corner of Clyde and Cly-
</p>
<p>bourn Avenue, near Ogden's Grove, under the sidewalk. They were empty.
</p>
<p>I found another one there which was loaded, and which I gave to Capt.
</p>
<p>Schaack. Gustav Lehman, who was a witness in this case, was with me
</p>
<p>when I found them. I got two coils of fuse, a can of dynamite and a box of
</p>
<p>caps at the same time. I found these two pieces of gas-pipe (indicating)
</p>
<p>at 509 North Halsted Street, under the house of John Thielen, who was
</p>
<p>arrested, with two cigar-boxes full of dynamite and two boxes of cartridges,
</p>
<p>one rifle, one revolver. The revolver and one box of cartridges were buried
</p>
<p>under the floor of the coal-shed, and two bombs which were loaded, the
</p>
<p>dynamite and rifle and other box of cartridges were buried under the house
</p>
<p>in the ground. The can of dynamite which Lehman pointed out to me, and
</p>
<p>which I found near Ogden's Grove, held about a gallon. This can and the
</p>
<p>box of caps were on the stone of the pavement ; the bombs were buried in
</p>
<p>the ground."

</p>
<p>At this stage of the proceedings I was myself put on the stand. My
</p>
<p>testimony, as taken by the stenographers, was as follows :
</p>
<p>" I am police captain of the Fifth Precinct. My headquarters are at East
</p>
<p>Chicago Avenue Station. I have charge of two other stations besides.
</p>
<p>Have been connected with the force for eighteen years. Have been cap-
</p>
<p>tain one year. I have seen Spies, iSchwab, Neebe and Fischer. Had no
</p>
<p>personal acquaintance with them. The defendants Engel and Lingg were
</p>
<p>arrested and confined in my station. Lingg was arrested on May i4th ;
</p>
<p>Engel about the i8th. I had my first conversation with Lingg about this
</p>
<p>case about three o'clock on the afternoon of May i4th. Lingg told me his
</p>
<p>name, and that he had lived at 442 Sedgwick Street. He had been out of
</p>
<p>work for about four weeks. I asked him whether he was at the meeting
</p>
<p>held in the basement of 54 West Lake Street on Monday night, and he
</p>
<p>said, 'Yes.' On Tuesday night, May 4th, he said, he was at home not all
</p>
<p>472 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>the evening. He and Seliger had been on Larrabee Street, quite a ways
</p>
<p>north ; had had several glasses of beer, and from there he went home. He
</p>
<p>said he had made some bombs to use them himself. He said he had rea-
</p>
<p>son for being down on the police ; they had clubbed him out at McCor-
</p>
<p>mick's. He said he was down on capitalists, and found fault with the
</p>
<p>police for taking the part of the capitalists. If the capitalists turned out
</p>
<p>the militia and the police force with their Catling guns, they couldn't do
</p>
<p>anything with revolvers, and therefore they had adopted these bombs and
</p>
<p>dynamite. He said he had learned to make bombs in scientific books of
</p>
<p>warfare published by Most, of New York. He had got his dynamite on
</p>
<p>Lake Street, somewhere near Dearborn, and had bought some fuse and
</p>
<p>caps, and told me what he paid for it. He had not used up all his dyna-
</p>
<p>mite. He said he had made bombs of gas-pipe, and also of metal and lead
</p>
<p>mixed. He found the gas-pipe on the street sometimes. The lead he got
</p>
<p>about the same way. He said the bombs they found in his place were all
</p>
<p>he made. We put Mrs. Seliger face to face with him, and she accused him
</p>
<p>that he had commenced making bombs a few weeks after he came to their
</p>
<p>house. He looked at the woman, but didn't say anything. John Thielen,
</p>
<p>who was arrested at the time, faced him too. Lingg admitted he had
</p>
<p>given to Thielen the two cigar-boxes full of dynamite and the two bombs
</p>
<p>which Officer Hoffman brought to me ; at the same time Lingg looked
</p>
<p>right square at Thielen and shook his head for him to keep still. Thielen
</p>
<p>said to him, ' Never mind, you might as well tell it. They know it all,
</p>
<p>anyhow. '
</p>
<p>"In Lingg's trunk I discovered a false bottom, and in there I found two
</p>
<p>long cartridges of dynamite, and some fuse four inches long, with caps on,
</p>
<p>and a big coil of fuse. I asked Lingg if that was the dynamite he used in
</p>
<p>his bombs, and he said yes. The dynamite in the package is lighter in
</p>
<p>quality than what was found in his bombs, except one that was black. I got
</p>
<p>three kinds of dynamite. That in the gallon-box that Lehman testified
</p>
<p>was given to him by Lingg looked like charcoal ; the dynamite in the trunk
</p>
<p>was white, and the dynamite in most of those bombs is dark-colored.
</p>
<p>Lingg said he had tried a round bomb and a long one in the open air
</p>
<p>somewhere, and they worked well. He put one right in the crotch of a

<p>tree and split it all up. He said he had known Spies for some time. He
</p>
<p>had been at the Arbeiter-Zeitung office about five times, bringing reports of
</p>
<p>Socialistic and Anarchistic meetings to the Arbeiter-Zeitung. He stated
</p>
<p>he had been financial secretary of a branch of the Carpenters' Union. He
</p>
<p>had been a Socialist ever since he could think. He told me he had been in
</p>
<p>this country since last July or August ; he had been a Socialist in Europe."
</p>
<p>"Now give the conversation which you had with Engel. "
</p>
<p>" Engel said, in the first conversation that I had with him, that on Mon-
</p>
<p>day, 3d of May, he was doing some fresco work for a friend by the name of
</p>
<p>Koch, somewhere out west. He had been for a little while at the 54 West
</p>
<p>Lake Street meeting that night, but made no speech there.
</p>
<p>"Several days afterwards I had another conversation, when his wife and
</p>
<p>daughter came. Engel complained that his cell was dark and no water
</p>
<p>running in it, and I told him we would give him another cell if we had it.
</p>
<p>The cells were crowded right along that night. And his wife said, 'Do
</p>
<p>you see now what trouble you got yourself into ? ' and Engel answered,
</p>
<p>' Mamma, I can't help it.' I asked him why he didn't stop that nonsense,
</p>
<p>and he said : ' I promised my wife so many times that I would stop this busi-

</p>
<p>ness, but I can't stop it. What is in me has got to come out. I can't help
</p>
<p>it that I am so gifted with eloquence. It is a curse. It has been a curse
</p>
<p>to a good many other men. A good many men have suffered already for
</p>
<p>the same cause, and I am willing to suffer and will stand it like a man."
</p>
<p>And I think he mentioned Louise Michel as having taken a leading part in
</p>
<p>the Anarchist business. Engel said on the evening of May 4th he was at
</p>
<p>home tying on the lounge.
</p>
<p>"I have experimented with all dynamite that was brought me ; also the
</p>
<p>bombs. I gave a portion of the lead bomb which Officer Schuettler testi-
</p>
<p>fied he found in Lingg's room to Professor Haines. I took the dynamite
</p>
<p>from that bomb and put the dynamite in a piece of gas-pipe, about five
</p>
<p>inches long, with ends screwed on. I had a box made two feet square,
</p>
<p>of inch boards, pretty well nailed together, and we dug a hole three feet
</p>
<p>deep out at Lake View, in the bushes, put the box into the hole, cut a hole
</p>
<p>in the top of the box, let the bomb into it, put a fuse and cap to it, and
</p>
<p>touched it off. This was found as the result of the explosion (indicating
</p>
<p>fragments). The box was blown all to pieces, and some of the pieces flew up
</p>
<p>in the trees. Everything in that box was smashed to pieces. This bomb
</p>
<p>here (indicating) I have made in the same way, and filled it with some
</p>
<p>black dynamite from that gallon can which was given by Lingg to Leh-
</p>
<p>man, as stated here. This here (indicating fragments of the exploded
</p>
<p>bomb) was the result of the examination. I put some dynamite also in a
</p>
<p>beer keg. It smashed the keg all to pieces.
</p>
<p>" Now here are the fragments from a lead bomb which Lehman gave to
</p>
<p>Hoffman and Hoffman to me. We got a piece of boiler-iron a quarter of
</p>
<p>an inch thick, nineteen inches high, and thirty-four inches wide. Then we
</p>
<p>had a steel top weighing 140 pounds. On the ground I put two-inch plank.
</p>
<p>On top of the plank I put four large metal sheets. I put the bomb right in
</p>
<p>the center, and a big stone weighing about 125 pounds on top, and the
</p>
<p>inside of the boiler-iron, the tub, I had painted so we could see where the
</p>
<p>lead would strike. I touched it off myself. It knocked the tub away up in
</p>
<p>the air, and the stone on top was crushed all to pieces. This is the result
</p>
<p>of the lead after we picked it up on top of the boards (indicating fragments
</p>
<p>of the tub). Here is the bolt (indicating) that was on the bomb. The nut

</p>
<p>we did not find. I counted 195 places where the lead struck the painted
</p>
<p>boiler-iron. There is % a crack clear through the boiler-iron. In six places
</p>
<p>it is bulged out. Professor Haines has got a piece of this bomb (indicat-
</p>
<p>ing), and Professor Patton another piece. I gave to the professors pieces
</p>
<p>of metal from other bombs.
</p>
<p>" Lingg in his conversations with me said there would likely be a revo-
</p>
<p>lution through this workingmen's trouble. There was a satchel brought
</p>
<p>from Neff's place. The satchel was filled with bombs. Thielen was pres-
</p>
<p>ent. I asked him if he brought the satchel there. He said he saw the
</p>
<p>satchel there, saw it stand there when he left, and that was the last he saw
</p>
<p>of it. Lingg said he made the molds to make these bombs himself. He
</p>
<p>made them of clay, and that they could be used to cast in only about twice.
</p>
<p>He said he saw the 'Revenge' circular on the West Side, I believe at 71
</p>
<p>West Lake Street. I asked him when he had had his hair trimmed and his
</p>
<p>chin beard shaved. He said on or about the 7th of May. He said there
</p>
<p>had been several persons in his room on the afternoon of May 4th, among
</p>
<p>them the two Lehmans.
</p>
<p>"I experimented with fuse. I cut a fuse four inches long and set it on
</p>
<p>474 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS,
</p>
<p>fire, and you could count just six until it struck the cap within. I experi-
</p>
<p>mented with dynamite cartridges. I drilled a hole in one end about an inch
</p>
<p>and a half deep, shoved a percussion cap in, put a fuse on, and exploded
</p>
<p>it. I had it stand free up in the air in a stone weighing about twenty or
</p>
<p>thirty pounds. When it went off it broke the stone all up. I put one right
</p>
<p>in the center of a lot of shrubs and bushes, and it broke everything up
</p>
<p>took around about four feet each way."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination I stated that I had never taken Lingg before any
</p>
<p>magistrate for examination. There was no complaint entered against him.
</p>
<p>FREDERICK DREWS saw some cans underneath the sidewalk at his home,
</p>
<p>No. 351 North Paulina Street, about three miles from the Haymarket, and
</p>
<p>testified to having turned them over to me. His residence was about a mile
</p>
<p>and a half from Wicker Park.
</p>
<p>MICHAEL WHALEN, a detective connected with the Chicago Avenue Sta-
</p>
<p>tion, testified to having seen the cans referred to by the preceding witness
</p>
<p>in the yard at No. 351 North Paulina Street, and that there were four of
</p>
<p>those cans, one of which they emptied.
</p>
<p>DANIEL COUGHLIN, a police officer, testified as to the explosive character
</p>
<p>of one of the cans found at North Paulina Street, with a fulminating cap
</p>
<p>and fuse about eight inches long. After igniting the fuse an explosion was
</p>
<p>caused which shattered the can, throwing the contents, some kind of vitriol,
</p>
<p>four or five feet around.
</p>
<p>CHARLES E. PROUTY, manager of a gun-store at No. 53 State Street, re-
</p>
<p>called a visit of Mr. and Mrs. Engel at the store the previous fall.
</p>
<p>"They made some inquiries in regard to some large revolvers. They
</p>
<p>found one there that seemed to be satisfactory, and wanted to know at what
</p>
<p>price they could get a quantity of them, perhaps one or two hundred, and
</p>
<p>wanted to buy that one and pay for it and present it at some meeting of
</p>
<p>some society. They took the pistol and paid for it. A week or two after
</p>
<p>they returned, said the pistol was satisfactory, and wanted to know if I could
</p>
<p>get them a lot. I said I knew of one lot in the East, and would inquire. I
</p>
<p>wrote East, and found the lot had been disposed of. They were somewhat
</p>
<p>disappointed, but said they had found something else for a little less money
</p>
<p>that would answer the purpose, and with that they left our store. Mrs.

<p>Engel comes frequently to our store. She has a little store on the West
</p>
<p>Side, and buys fishing-tackle and other things in our line. I sold cartridges
</p>
<p>to them in a small way, as she might want them in her store. When I spoke
</p>
<p>of guns I meant large revolvers, something about seven-inch barrel I think
</p>
<p>44 or 45-caliber, at $5.50 apiece. When I stated the price was very cheap
</p>
<p>they replied they didn't care to make profit on them, it was for a society.
</p>
<p>I remember seeing Mr. Parsons' face in the store. Never had any dealings
</p>
<p>with him."
</p>
<p>WILLIAM J. REYNOLDS, in the employ of D. H. Lamberson & Co., gun
</p>
<p>business at No. 76 State Street, testified :
</p>
<p>" I think about February or March of this year Mr. Parsons came to our
</p>
<p>store. He said he wanted to buy a quantity of revolvers I think forty or
</p>
<p>THE CHEMICAL ANALYSIS. 475
</p>
<p>fifty. He wanted what is called an old remodeled Remington revolver, 44
</p>
<p>or 45-caliber. I agreed to write and get a quotation of the revolver. He
</p>
<p>came in again, and I quoted him a price upon it. He did not purchase any
</p>
<p>revolvers, and was in once or twice after that. He seemed undecided
</p>
<p>about it."
</p>
<p>THOMAS MCNAMARA, a police officer, testified :
</p>
<p>" I found thirty loaded and one empty gas-pipe bombs under the side-
</p>
<p>walk on Bloomingdale Road and Robey Street. The loaded bombs were
</p>
<p>fixed with caps and fuse. They were in an oil-cloth. The corner where I
</p>
<p>found them is about four blocks from Wicker Park. Found them on the
</p>
<p>afternoon of May 23 last. Three coils of fuse in a tin can and two boxes
</p>
<p>of dynamite caps probably about two hundred caps were also in the
</p>
<p>package."
</p>
<p>Prof. WALTER S. HAINES examined a number of bomb fragments and
</p>
<p>testified as follows :
</p>
<p>" I am professor of chemistry in Rush Medical College in this city. I
</p>
<p>devote most of my time to practical chemistry. I have examined several
</p>
<p>pieces of metal at the request of the State's Attorney. I received from
</p>
<p>Capt. Schaack, on June 24 this year, a piece of bomb said to have been
</p>
<p>connected with Lingg. I call it ' Lingg bomb No. i.' I received from Dr.
</p>
<p>J. B. Murphy, on the same day, a piece of metal said to have been taken
</p>
<p>from Officer Murphy. I designate it ' Murphy bomb.' On July 22 I
</p>
<p>received a piece of metal said to have been taken from Officer Degan. I
</p>
<p>designate it ' Degan bomb.' The last piece I received from Mr. Furth-
</p>
<p>mann. I subsequently received from Officer Whalen a piece of bomb said
</p>
<p>to have been connected with Lingg. I designate it ' Lingg bomb No. 2/
</p>
<p>The next day I received from Capt. Schaack pieces of two other bombs
</p>
<p>also said to have been connected with Lingg. I designate as ' Lingg
</p>
<p>bombs Nos. 3 and 4.' I received from Mr. Furthmann a portion of a bomb
</p>
<p>said to have been connected with Mr. Spies, which I designate as ' Spies
</p>
<p>bomb.' These were all subjected to chemical examination. Lingg bombs
</p>
<p>Nos. i, 3 and 4 were found to consist chiefly of lead, with a small percentage
</p>
<p>of tin and traces of antimony, iron and zinc. The amount of tin in these
</p>
<p>three bombs differs slightly. One of them contained about 1.9 per cent.,

</p>
<p>another about 2.4 per cent., the third about 2^ per cent, of tin. Lingg
</p>
<p>bomb No. 2 contained more tin, consequently less lead ; also a little more
</p>
<p>antimony and a little more zinc. The amount of tin in this bomb was very
</p>
<p>nearly seven per cent. The Murphy bomb was composed of a small pro-
</p>
<p>portion of tin, chiefly lead and traces of antimony, iron and zinc. The
</p>
<p>amount of tin was in round numbers 1.6 per cent. The Degan bomb con-
</p>
<p>tained in round numbers 1.6 or 1.7 per cent. The remainder was lead,
</p>
<p>with traces of antimony, iron and zinc. The Spies bomb consisted chiefly
</p>
<p>of lead with a small quantity of tin, about i.i per cent., in round numbers,
</p>
<p>with traces of antimony, iron and zinc. The different pieces of the same
</p>
<p>bomb differed slightly in the proportions of the metals present. The
</p>
<p>Degan bomb contained slightly more tin than what I call the Murphy bomb.
</p>
<p>There is no commercial substance with which I am acquainted that has such
</p>
<p>a composition as these bombs. Commercial lead frequently contains traces
</p>
<p>of other substances, but, as far as I know, never tin. Solder is composed
</p>
<p>of from a third to a half tin and the remainder lead. Lead must have been
</p>
<p>476 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>the basis for the preparation of the various articles which I examined, and
</p>
<p>this must have been mixed either with tin or some substance containing tin,
</p>
<p>as for instance solder.
</p>
<p>" Lingg bomb No. 2 had a minute trace of copper. This piece of candle-
</p>
<p>stick (indicating) is composed of tin and lead, with a certain amount of
</p>
<p>antimony and zinc and a little copper. Professor Patton has been sick for
</p>
<p>about two weeks. I worked in connection with Professor Delafontaine
</p>
<p>instead of working with Patton." (The Spies bomb is the one which the
</p>
<p>witness Wilkinson identified.)
</p>
<p>Prof. MARK DELAFONTAINE testified as follows :
</p>
<p>" I am a chemist, teacher of chemistry in the High School in this city.
</p>
<p>Have been a chemist for over thirty years. I made an examination of the
</p>
<p>substances described by Prof. Haines, compared results with him, and they
</p>
<p>agreed as closely as they can. I found the piece of candlestick to be a mix-
</p>
<p>ture of antimony, tin, lead, zinc and a trace of copper. I made experiments
</p>
<p>with old lead pipes upon which there was solder. I took a piece of old
</p>
<p>lead pipe that had been very much mended, had much solder put on ; I
</p>
<p>melted it, analyzed it, and the amount of tin contained in the mixture was
</p>
<p>about seven-tenths of one per cent. I don't know of any one commercial
</p>
<p>product of which the pieces of bomb that I examined could be composed.
</p>
<p>I never found a sample of lead containing the least traces of tin."
</p>
<p>MICHAEL WHALEN, recalled, testified that he gave to Prof. Haines two
</p>
<p>pieces of lead which I had given to him.
</p>
<p>EDMUND FURTHMANN, Assistant State's Attorney, stated that the piece
</p>
<p>of lead he gave to Prof. Haines he had received from Dr. Bluthardt, and
</p>
<p>designated the various halls and places spoken of by various witnesses as
</p>
<p>being all located in Cook County and the State of Illinois.
</p>
<p>THEODORE J. BLUTHARDT was then called and gave the following evidence:
</p>
<p>"I am County Physician. I made a post-mortem examination upon the
</p>
<p>body of Mathias J. Degan, on the 5th day of May last, before the Coroner's
</p>
<p>inquest, at the Cook County Hospital. I found a deep cut upon his fore-
</p>
<p>head, another cut over the right eye and another deep cut, about two inches
</p>
<p>in length, on the left side. I found a large wound, apparently a gun-shot
</p>
<p>wound a hole in the middle of the left thigh. I found seven explosive

</p>
<p>marks on his right leg and two on the left leg. The large hole in the
</p>
<p>middle of the left thigh was the mortal wound caused by an explosive, a
</p>
<p>piece of lead that had penetrated the skin, destroyed the inside muscles
</p>
<p>and lacerated the femoral artery, which caused bleeding to death. Besides
</p>
<p>that he had a wound on the dorsum of the left foot, also caused by a piece
</p>
<p>of lead, which forced its way through the bones of the ankle joint. I found
</p>
<p>a piece behind the inside ankle of the left foot. Both pieces I gave to Mr.
</p>
<p>Furthmann. The external appearance of that wound on that left thigh was
</p>
<p>that of a rifle ball. It was round and not very ragged ; it was clean cut
</p>
<p>through the skin, but the muscles of the thigh were all contused and torn
</p>
<p>formed a kind of pulpy cavity as large as a goose egg on the inside. The
</p>
<p>missile was lodged in the upper part of the thigh, about four inches above
</p>
<p>the place where it entered. Mathias J. Degan died of hemorrhage of the
</p>
<p>femoral artery, caused by this wound that I described.
</p>
<p>THE HAYMARKET MARTYRS. 477
</p>
<p>" I made ^.post-mortem examination on the body of John Barrett on the
</p>
<p>7th of May, at 171 East Chicago Avenue. A missile had passed through
</p>
<p>the eleventh rib into the upper part of the liver, about three inches deep.
</p>
<p>There I found a piece of lead and a piece of blue cloth with lining in. The
</p>
<p>right lung was collapsed. From the opening into the diaphragm the air
</p>
<p>rushed into the cavity of the chest and compressed the lung. In conse-
</p>
<p>quence of the wound in the liver there was a good deal of hemorrhage into
</p>
<p>the chest as well as into the abdomen. This wound, by this explosive piece
</p>
<p>of material, was the cause of his death. He had several other wounds.
</p>
<p>"On the same day I made a post-mortem examination on the body of
</p>
<p>George F. Muller, at the Cook County Hospital. This man died, in my
</p>
<p>opinion, from the effects of a pistol ball which wounded the small intestines
</p>
<p>and caused inflammation of the bowels.
</p>
<p>"On May 8th I made a post-mortem examination on the body of Tim
</p>
<p>Flavin. He had a small wound in the back four inches to the left of the
</p>
<p>spine. The missile, which was not a pistol ball, passed into the abdomen
</p>
<p>below the twelfth rib. I found much blood in both cavities, and the cause
</p>
<p>of his death was internal hemorrhage.
</p>
<p>"On May loth I made a post-mortem examination on the body of Michael
</p>
<p>Sheehan. He died from exhaustion caused by a pistol shot wound upon the
</p>
<p>right side of the abdomen, three inches to the right and four inches above
</p>
<p>the umbilicus. The ball passed through the mesentary and lower part of
</p>
<p>the liver into the muscles of the abdomen. There was considerable blood
</p>
<p>in the abdomen and the liver. The surroundings were very much inflamed.
</p>
<p>"On May i7th I made a post-mortem examination on the body of Thomas
</p>
<p>Redden, at the Cook County Hospital. I found an abrasion over the right
</p>
<p>eye, a slight lacerated wound upon the lower part of the left hip, a large
</p>
<p>lacerated wound perforating the right forearm, a compound fracture of the
</p>
<p>left tibia, a large lacerated wound upon the posterior part of the left leg, a
</p>
<p>circular wound upon the right leg two inches below the knee joint, extend-
</p>
<p>ing to the bone, another wound upon the right leg about seven inches above
</p>
<p>the ankle, a large lacerated wound upon the left side of the back. I found
</p>
<p>the lungs badly inflamed and the blood valves enlarged above the kidneys,
</p>
<p>and the liver somewhat inflamed with so-called cloudy swelling. In my

<p>opinion he died from the effects of these wounds bringing about blood-
</p>
<p>poisoning. "
</p>
<p>JAMES BONFIELD, being recalled, stated :
</p>
<p>" I found a number of banners at the Arbeiter-Zeitung. I found, alto-
</p>
<p>gether, about forty banners. I can identify only a few of them as found at
</p>
<p>the Arbeiter-Zeitung."
</p>
<p>State's Attorney Grinnell here announced that the prosecution rested its
</p>
<p>case. Thereupon counsel for the defendants moved that the jury be sent
</p>
<p>from the court-room while they would present and argue, on behalf of
</p>
<p>Neebe, a motion that the jury be instructed to find a verdict of not guilty
</p>
<p>as to Neebe. Judge Gary refused the motion.
</p>
<p>A like motion on behalf of the other defendants, except August Spies
</p>
<p>and Adolph Fischer, was also overruled by the court.

<p>M
</p>
<p>R. MOSES SALOMON opened the case for the Anarchists on Sat-
</p>
<p>urday, July 31. He proceeded to state that the defendants had
</p>
<p>steadily refused to believe that any man on the jury would be willing to
</p>
<p>convict any of the defendants because of being an Anarchist or a Socialist.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Grinnell," said Mr. Salomon, "failed to state to you that he had a
</p>
<p>person by whom he could prove who threw the bomb, and he never expected
</p>
<p>to make this proof until he found that without this proof he was unable to
</p>
<p>maintain this prosecution against these defendants ; and it was as this case
</p>
<p>neared the prosecution end of it that the State suddenly changed front and
</p>
<p>produced a professional tramp and a professional liar, as we will show you,
</p>
<p>to prove that one of these defendants was connected with the throwing of
</p>
<p>it. They then recognized, as we claimed and now claim, that that is the
</p>
<p>only way they can maintain their case here."
</p>
<p>Mr. Salomon next directed the attention of the jury to the charge against
</p>
<p>the defendants and said :
</p>
<p>" As I told you a moment ago, they are not charged with Anarchy ; they
</p>
<p>are not charged with Socialism ; they are not charged with the fact that
</p>
<p>Anarchy and Socialism is dangerous or beneficial to the community ; but,
</p>
<p>according to the law under which we are now acting, a charge specific in
</p>
<p>its nature must be made against them, and that alone must be sustained,
</p>
<p>and it is the duty of the jury to weigh the evidence as it bears upon that
</p>
<p>charge ; and upon no other point can they pay attention to it. Now, gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, the charge here is shown by this indictment. This is the accusa-
</p>
<p>tion. This is what the case involves, and upon this the defendants and the
</p>
<p>prosecution must either stand or fall. This indictment is for the murder of
</p>
<p>Mathias J. Degan. It is charged that each one of these defendants com-
</p>
<p>mitted the crime, each defendant individually ; and it is charged in a num-
</p>
<p>ber of different ways. Now, I desire to call your attention to the law gov-

</p>
<p>erning this indictment and to read it to you ; and I am presenting the law
</p>
<p>to you now. gentlemen, so that you can understand how we view this case
</p>
<p>and how the evidence is affected by what the law is."
</p>
<p>Mr. Salomon then read the law touching murder and the statute on
</p>
<p>accessories and explained :
</p>
<p>" The law says, no matter whether these defendants advised generally the
</p>
<p>use of dynamite in the purpose which they claimed to carry out, and sought
</p>
<p>to carry out, yet if none of these defendants advised the throwing of that
</p>

</p>
<p>others at other times and other places. What does the evidence introduced
</p>
<p>here tend to show ? It may occur to some of you, gentlemen, to ask :
</p>
<p>'What, then, can these defendants preach the use of dynamite? May they
</p>
<p>be allowed to go on and urge people to overturn the present government
</p>
<p>and the present condition of society without being held responsible for it
</p>
<p>and without punishment ? Is there no law to which these people can be
</p>
<p>subjected and punished if they do this thing? ' There is, gentlemen, but it
</p>
<p>is not and never has been murder, and if they are amenable, as the evidence
</p>
<p>introduced by the prosecution tends to show, it is under another and a
</p>
<p>different law, and no attempt on the part of the prosecution to jump the
</p>
<p>wide chasm which separates these two offenses can be successful unless it
</p>
<p>is done out of pure hatred, malice, ill-will, or because of prejudice. The
</p>
<p>law protects every citizen. It punishes every guilty man, and according to
</p>
<p>the measure of his crime ; no more and no less. If a man be guilty of con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, or if he be guilty of treason, he is
</p>
<p>liable to punishment for that offense, and
</p>
<p>not for a higher one. This is what the
</p>
<p>people of the State of Illinois have said,
</p>
<p>and that is their law. That is what they
</p>
<p>want enforced, and that is what I stand
</p>
<p>here for as the advocate of these defendants.
</p>
<p>I claim for them, and for the entire people
</p>
<p>of this State, that the law shall be applied
</p>
<p>as it is found, and as they have directed
</p>
<p>it to be enforced. Now, what is the statute
</p>
<p>on conspiracy, of which these defendants
</p>
<p>may be guilty, if they are guilty of any-
</p>
<p>thing ?"
</p>
<p>He next read the law with reference to
</p>
<p>conspiracy and proceeded :

</p>

</p>
<p>those sections which I have last read to you, and no other, if they have
</p>
<p>a case against them at all. Now, gentlemen, I have read to you the
</p>
<p>section of the statute relating to accessories. As I have told you before, it
</p>
<p>is only the perpetrator and abettor in the perpetration of a crime who,
</p>
<p>under the decision of almost every supreme court in the United States and
</p>
<p>England, can be held."
</p>
<p>Mr. Salomon touched on one or two minor points and concluded as
</p>
<p>follows :
</p>
<p>" That view of the law, that they must be proven to be accessories to the
</p>
<p>crime, is the one point only upon which the prosecution can sustain their
</p>
<p>case, and is the only one upon which this case must proceed, according to
</p>
<p>our view. Now, these defendants are not criminals ; they are not robbers ;
</p>
<p>they are not burglars ; they are not common thieves ; they descend to no
</p>
<p>small criminal act. On the contrary, this evidence shows conclusively that
</p>
<p>they are men of broad feelings of humanity, that their only desire has been,
</p>
<p>and their lives have been consecrated to, the betterment of their fellow-men.
</p>
<p>480 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>They have not sought to take the life of any man, of any individual, to ma-
</p>
<p>liciously kill or destroy any person, nor have they sought to deprive any
</p>
<p>man of his property for their own benefit. They have not sought to get
</p>
<p>McCormick's property for themselves ; they have not sought to get Marshall
</p>
<p>Field's property for themselves, and to deprive Marshall Field of it felo-
</p>
<p>niously, but they have endeavored and labored to establish a different social
</p>
<p>system. It is true they have adopted means, or wanted to adopt means that
</p>
<p>were not approved of by all mankind. It is true that their methods were
</p>
<p>dangerous, perhaps ; but then they should have been stopped at their incep-
</p>
<p>tion. We shall expect to prove to you, gentlemen, that these men have
</p>
<p>stood by the man who has the least friends ; that they have endeavored to
</p>
<p>better the condition of the laboring man. The laboring men have few
</p>
<p>friends enough. They have no means, without the combination and assist-
</p>
<p>ance of their fellow-men, to better their condition, and it was to further that
</p>
<p>purpose and to raise them above constant labor and constant toil and con-
</p>
<p>stant worry and constant fret, and to have their fellow-men act and be as
</p>
<p>human beings and not as animals, that these defendants have consecrated
</p>
<p>their lives and energies. If it was in pursuance of that, wrought up, per-
</p>
<p>haps, through frequent failures and through the constant force exercised
</p>
<p>against them, that they came to the conclusion that it was necessary to use
</p>
<p>force against force, we know not, and we do not expect to prove nor to deny
</p>
<p>that these defendants advocated the use of force, nor do we now intend to
</p>
<p>apologize for anything they have said, nor to excuse their acts. It is neither
</p>
<p>the place nor the time for counsel in this case, nor of the gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>jury, to either excuse the acts of these defendants nor to encourage them.
</p>
<p>With that we have here nothing to do. Our object is simply to show that
</p>
<p>these defendants are not guilty of the murder with which they are charged
</p>
<p>in this indictment. But the issue is forced upon us to say whether it was
</p>
<p>right or wrong, and whether they had the right to advocate the bettering of
</p>
<p>their fellow-men. As Mr. Grinnell said, he wanted to hang Socialism and
</p>
<p>Anarchy ; but twelve men nor twelve hundred nor twelve thousand can
</p>
<p>stamp out Anarchy nor root out Socialism, no more than they can Democ-
</p>
<p>racy or Republicanism, that lie within the heart and within the head. Un-
</p>
<p>der our forms of government every man has the right to believe and the

</p>
<p>right to express his thoughts, whether they be inimical to the present insti-
</p>
<p>tutions or whether they favor them ; but if that man, no matter what he
</p>
<p>advocates or who he be, whether Democrat, Republican, Socialist or An-
</p>
<p>archist, kill and destroy human life deliberately and feloniously, that man,
</p>
<p>whether high or low, is amenable to criminal justice, and must be punished
</p>
<p>for his crime, and for no other.
</p>
<p>" Now, what was the object of these defendants, as they are charged, in
</p>
<p>being so bloodthirsty ? Their purpose was to change society, to bring into
</p>
<p>force and effect their Socialistic and Anarchistic ideas. Were they right or
</p>
<p>were they wrong, or have we nothing to do with it ? As I told you, they
</p>
<p>had the right to express their ideas. They had the right. They had the
</p>
<p>right to gain converts, to make Anarchists and Socialists, but whether
</p>
<p>Socialism or Anarchy shall ever be established never rested with these
</p>
<p>defendants, never rested in a can of dynamite or in a dynamite bomb. It
</p>
<p>rests with the great mass of people, with the people of Chicago, of Illinois,
</p>
<p>of the United States, of the world. If they, the people, want Anarchy, want
</p>
<p>Socialism, if they want Democracy or Republicanism, they can and they will
</p>
<p>inaugurate it. But the people, also, will allow a little toleration of views..
</p>
<p>THE PLEA OF FREE SPEECH. 481
</p>
<p>Now, these defendants claim that Socialism is a progressive social science,
</p>
<p>and it will be a part of the proof which you will have to determine. Must
</p>
<p>the world stand as we found it when we were born, or have we a right to
</p>
<p>show our fellow-men a better way, a nobler life, a better condition ? That
</p>
<p>is what these defendants claim, if they are forced beyond the issue in this
</p>
<p>case. ... In furtherance of that plan, what have these defendants
</p>
<p>done ? Have they murdered many people ? What was their plan when
</p>
<p>they counseled dynamite ? They intended to use dynamite in furtherance
</p>
<p>of the general revolution ; never, never against any individual. We will
</p>
<p>show you that it was their purpose, as the proof, I think, partly shows
</p>
<p>already, that when a general revolution or a general strike was inaugurated,
</p>
<p>when they were attacked, that then, in fact, while carrying out the purposes
</p>
<p>of that strike or that revolution, that then they should use dynamite, and
</p>
<p>not until then. If it is unlawful to conspire to carry out that thing, these
</p>
<p>men must be held for that thing. We shall show you that these men, in
</p>
<p>carrying out their plan for the bettering of the condition of the workingmen,
</p>
<p>inaugurated the eight-hour movement. They inaugurated the early-closing
</p>
<p>movement. They inaugurated every movement that tended to alleviate the
</p>
<p>condition of the workingman and allow him a greater time to his family, for
</p>
<p>mutual benefit. That is what these defendants set up for a defense. That
</p>
<p>is what they claim was their right to do, and that is what they claim they
</p>
<p>did do, and they did nothing more.
</p>
<p>"Now, gentlemen, we don't say that we desire to go into this proof, be-
</p>
<p>cause we think it has nothing to do with this case, if our theory is correct ;
</p>
<p>but if we are forced to show why they did these things it is simply to con-
</p>
<p>vince you that their objects were not for robbery, not for stealing, not to
</p>
<p>gain property for themselves, and not to maliciously or willfully destroy any
</p>
<p>man's good name or his property interests.
</p>
<p>" We expect to show you, further, that these defendants never conspired,
</p>
<p>nor any one of them, to take the life of any single individual at any time or
</p>
<p>place ; that they never conspired or plotted to take, at this time or at any
</p>
<p>other time, the life of Mathias Degan or any number of policemen, except
</p>
<p>in self-defense while carrying out their original purpose. We expect, fur-
</p>
<p>ther, to show you that on the night of the 4th of May these defendants had

</p>
<p>assembled peaceably, that the purpose of the meeting was peaceable, that
</p>
<p>its objects were peaceable, that they delivered the same harangue as before,
</p>
<p>that the crowd listened, and that not a single act transpired there, previous
</p>
<p>to the coming of the policemen, by which any man in the audience could be
</p>
<p>held amenable to law. They assembled there, gentlemen, under the pro-
</p>
<p>vision of our Constitution, to exercise the right of free speech, to discuss
</p>
<p>the situation of the workingmen, to discuss the eight-hour question. They
</p>
<p>assembled there to incidentally discuss what they deemed outrages at
</p>
<p>McCormick's. No man expected that a bomb would be thrown ; no man
</p>
<p>expected that any one would be injured at that meeting; but while some of
</p>
<p>these defendants were there and while this meeting was peaceably in prog-
</p>
<p>ress, the police, with a devilish design, as we expect to prove, came down
</p>
<p>upon that body with their revolvers in their hands and pockets, ready for
</p>
<p>immediate use, intending to destroy the life of every man that stood upon
</p>
<p>that market square. That seems terrible, gentlemen, but that is the infor-
</p>
<p>mation which we have and which we expect to show you. We expect to
</p>
<p>show you further, gentlemen, that the crowd did not fire, that not a single
</p>
<p>person fired a single shot at the police officers. We expect to show you
</p>
<p>482 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>that Mr. Fielden did not have on that night, and never had in his life, a
</p>
<p>revolver ; that he did not fire, and that that portion of the testimony here is
</p>
<p>wrong. We expect to show you further, gentlemen, that the witness Gilmer,
</p>
<p>who testified to having seen Spies light the match which caused the destruc-
</p>
<p>tion coming from the bomb, is a professional and constitutional liar ; that
</p>
<p>no man in the city of Chicago who knows him will believe him under oath,
</p>
<p>and, indeed, I might almost say that it would scarcely need even a witness
</p>
<p>to show the falsity of his testimony, because it seems to me that it must fall
</p>
<p>of its own weight. We expect to show you, gentlemen, that Thompson was
</p>
<p>greatly mistaken ; that on that night Schwab never saw or talked with Mr.
</p>
<p>Spies ; that he was at the Haymarket early in the evening, but that he left
</p>
<p>before the meeting began and before he saw Mr. Spies on that evening at
</p>
<p>all. We expect to show that Mr. Parsons, so far from thinking anything
</p>
<p>wrong, and Fischer, were quietly seated at Zepf's Hall, drinking, perhaps, a
</p>
<p>glass of beer at the time the bomb exploded, and that it was as great a sur-
</p>
<p>prise to them as it was to any of you. We expect to show you that Engel
</p>
<p>was at home at the time the bomb exploded, and that he knew nothing
</p>
<p>about it. With the whereabouts of Lingg you are already familiar. It may
</p>
<p>seem strange why he was manufacturing bombs. The answer to that is,
</p>
<p>he had a right to have his house full of dynamite. He had a right to have
</p>
<p>weapons of all descriptions upon his premises, and until he used them, or
</p>
<p>advised their use, and they were used in pursuance of his advice, he is not
</p>
<p>liable any more than the man who commits numerous burglaries, the man
</p>
<p>who commits numerous thefts, who walks the streets, is liable to arrest and
</p>
<p>punishment only when he commits an act which makes him amenable to
</p>
<p>law.
</p>
<p>" I did not expect to address you concerning Mr. Neebe, and it is unneces-
</p>
<p>sary for me to make much comment on that, but we will show you that Mr.
</p>
<p>Neebe did not know of this meeting, that he was not present, that he was in
</p>
<p>no manner connected with it, and there is no proof to show that he was.
</p>
<p>We will also prove to you, gentlemen, that Mr. Fielden did not go down the
</p>
<p>alley, as some of the witnesses for the State have testified, but that he went
</p>
<p>down Desplaines Street to Randolph, and up Randolph, as, indeed, if my
</p>
<p>memory serves me right, the statements made by Mr. Fielden immediately

<p>after the occurrence already sufficiently show.
</p>
<p>" Now, gentlemen, in conclusion, as I stated to you a moment ago, we
</p>
<p>do not intend to defend against Socialism, we do not intend to defend
</p>
<p>against Anarchism ; we expect to be held responsible for that only which we
</p>
<p>have done, and to be held in the manner pointed out by law. Under the
</p>
<p>charge upon which these defendants are held under this indictment, we
</p>
<p>shall prove to you, and I hope to your entire satisfaction, that a case has
</p>
<p>not been made out against them. Whether they be Socialists or whether
</p>
<p>they be Anarchists we hope will not influence any one of you, gentlemen.
</p>
<p>Whatever they may have preached, or whatever they may have said, or
</p>
<p>whatever may have been their object, if it was not connected with the
</p>
<p>throwing of the bomb it is your sworn testimony to acquit them. We ex-
</p>
<p>pect to make all this proof, and we expect such a result."
</p>
<p>On the Monday following, being the 2d of August, the defense began
</p>
<p>its testimony. The first witness introduced was CARTER H. HARRISON, then
</p>
<p>Mayor of Chicago. His evidence was as follows :
</p>
<p>MAYOR HARRISON'S TESTIMONY. 483
</p>
<p>" I am Mayor of the city of Chicago since over seven years. On the
</p>
<p>4th of May last I was present during a part of the Haymarket meeting so-
</p>
<p>called. On the day before there was a riot at McCormick's factory, which
</p>
<p>was represented to me to have grown out of a speech made by Mr. Spies.
</p>
<p>During the morning of the 4th I received information of the issuance of a
</p>
<p>circular of a peculiar character and calling for a meeting at the Haymarket
</p>
<p>that night. I directed the Chief of Police that if anything should be said
</p>
<p>at that meeting that might call out a recurrence of such proceedings as at
</p>
<p>McCormick's factory, the meeting should be dispersed. I believed that it
</p>
<p>was better for myself to be there and disperse the meeting myself instead
</p>
<p>of leaving it to any policeman. I went to the meeting for the purpose of
</p>
<p>dispersing it in case I should feel it necessary for the safety of the city. I
</p>
<p>arrived there about five minutes before eight. There was a large concourse
</p>
<p>of people about the Haymarket, but it was so long before any speaking
</p>
<p>commenced that probably two-thirds of the people there assembled left, as
</p>
<p>it seemed to me. It was about half-past eight when the speaking com-
</p>
<p>menced and the meeting congregated around Crane's building, or the alley
</p>
<p>near it.
</p>
<p>" Mr. Spies may have been speaking one or two minutes before I got
</p>
<p>near enough to hear distinctly what he said. I judge I left the meeting be-
</p>
<p>tween 10 and 10:05 o'clock that night. I staid to hear Mr. Spies' speech,
</p>
<p>and I heard all of Mr. Parsons' up to the time I left, with the exception of
</p>
<p>five or ten minutes, during which I went over to the station. When I judged
</p>
<p>that Mr. Parsons was looking towards the close of his speech I went over
</p>
<p>to the station, spoke to Capt. Bonfield, and determined to go home, but in-
</p>
<p>stead of going immediately I went back to hear a little more ; staid there
</p>
<p>about five minutes longer and then left. Within about twenty minutes from
</p>
<p>the time that I left the meeting I heard the sound of the explosion of the
</p>
<p>bomb at my house. While at the meeting I noticed that I was observed
</p>
<p>when I struck a match to light my cigar and the full blaze showed my face.
</p>
<p>I thought Mr. Spies had observed me, as the tone of his speech suddenly
</p>
<p>changed, but that is mere conjecture. Prior to that change in the tone of
</p>
<p>Mr. Spies' speech I feared his remarks would force me to disperse the
</p>
<p>meeting. I was there for that purpose ; that is to say, it was my own de-

</p>
<p>termination to do it against the will of the police. After that occurrence
</p>
<p>the general tenor of Spies' speech was such that I remarked to Capt. Bon-
</p>
<p>field that it was tame."
</p>
<p>" Did anything transpire in the address of either Spies or Parsons, after
</p>
<p>the incident of the lighting of your cigar to which you have referred, that
</p>
<p>led you to conclude to take any action in reference to the dispersing of the
</p>
<p>meeting? "
</p>
<p>The State objected to an answer, and the objection was sustained.
</p>
<p>" I did in fact take no action at the meeting about dispersing it. There
</p>
<p>were occasional replies from the audience, as ' Shoot him,' ' Hang him' or
</p>
<p>the like, but I do not think, from the directions in which they came, here
</p>
<p>and there and around, that there were more than two or three hundred
</p>
<p>actual sympathizers with the speakers. Several times cries of Hang him'
</p>
<p>would come from a boy in the outskirts, and the crowd would laugh. I felt
</p>
<p>that a majority of the crowd were idle spectators, and the replies nearly as
</p>
<p>much what might be called ' guying ' as absolute applause. Some of the
</p>
<p>replies were evidently bitter ; they came from immediately around the
</p>
<p>stand. The audience numbered from eight hundred to one thousand. The
</p>
<p>484 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>people in attendance, so far as I could see during the half hour before the
</p>
<p>speaking commenced, were apparently laborers or mechanics, and the ma-
</p>
<p>jority of them not English-speaking people mostly Germans. There was
</p>
<p>no suggestion made by either of the speakers looking toward calling for the
</p>
<p>immediate use of force or violence toward any person that night ; if there
</p>
<p>had been I should have dispersed them at once. After I came back from
</p>
<p>the station Parsons was still speaking, but evidently approaching a close.
</p>
<p>It was becoming cloudy and looked like threatening rain, and I thought the
</p>
<p>thing was about over. There was not one-fourth of the crowd that had
</p>
<p>been there during the evening listening to the speakers at that time. In
</p>
<p>the crowd I heard a great many Germans use expressions of their being
</p>
<p>dissatisfied with bringing them there and having this speaking. When I
</p>
<p>went to the station during Parsons' speech, I stated to Capt. Bonfield that
</p>
<p>I thought the speeches were about over ; that nothing had occurred yet or
</p>
<p>looked likely to occur to require interference, and that he had better issue
</p>
<p>orders to his reserves at the other stations to go home. Bonfield replied
</p>
<p>that he had reached the same conclusion from reports brought to him, but
</p>
<p>he thought it would be best to retain the men in the station until the meet-
</p>
<p>ing broke up, and then referred to a rumor that he had heard that night
</p>
<p>which he thought would make it necessary for him to keep his men there,
</p>
<p>which I concurred in. During my attendance of the meeting I saw no
</p>
<p>weapons at all upon any person."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination Mr. Harrison stated :
</p>
<p>"The rumor that I referred to was related to me by Capt. Bonfield
</p>
<p>immediately after my reaching the station. Bonfield told me he had just
</p>
<p>received information that the Haymarket meeting, or a part of it, would go
</p>
<p>over to the Milwaukee and St. Paul freight-houses, then filled with 'scabs,'
</p>
<p>and blow it up. There was also an intimation that this meeting might be
</p>
<p>held merely to attract the attention of the police to the Haymarket, while the
</p>
<p>real attack, if any, should be made that night on McCormick's. Those
</p>
<p>were the contingencies in regard to which I was listening to those speeches.
</p>
<p>In listening to the speeches, I concluded it was not an organization to
</p>
<p>destroy property that night, and went home. My order to Bonfield was
</p>
<p>that the reserves held at the other stations might be sent home, because I

</p>
<p>learned that all was quiet in the district where McCormick's factory is sit-
</p>
<p>uated. Bonfield replied he had already ordered the reserves in the other
</p>
<p>stations to go in their regular order.
</p>
<p>"Bonfield was there, detailed by the Chief of Police, in control of that
</p>
<p>meeting, together with Capt. Ward. I don't remember of hearing Parsons
</p>
<p>call ' To arms ! To arms ! To arms ! ' When I speak of a rumor in regard
</p>
<p>to a possible attack upon McCormick's, the fact is it was not a rumor
</p>
<p>that came from others, but rather a fear or apprehension on my own part,
</p>
<p>and it was suggested first by myself that this might be the aim of this
</p>
<p>meeting. There was a direct statement by Mr. Bonfield to me that he had
</p>

</p>
<p>" The speakers were northeast from me, in front of Crane Bros', build-
</p>
<p>ing, a few feet north of the alley. I remember the alley particularly. As
</p>
<p>far as I remember Spies' speech, he said : ' Please come to order. This
</p>
<p>meeting is not called to incite any riot.' He then said that McCormick
</p>
<p>had charged him with the murder of the people at the meeting the night
</p>
<p>before ; that Mr. McCormick was a liar. McCormick was himself respon-
</p>
<p>sible. Somebody had opposed his speaking at the meeting near McCor-
</p>
<p>mick's because he was a Socialist. The people he spoke to were good
</p>
<p>Christian, church-going people. While he was speaking, McCormick's
</p>
<p>people had come out. Some of the men and boys had started for them,
</p>
<p>and had had" some harmless sport throwing stones into the windows, etc.
</p>
<p>Then he said that some workingmen were shot at and killed by the police.
</p>
<p>That is as far as my memory goes.
</p>
<p>"Parsons illustrated that the capitalists got the great bulk of the profit
</p>
<p>out of everything done. I remember in his speech he said: 'To arms!
</p>
<p>To arms ! To arms ! ' but in what connection I cannot remember. Some-
</p>
<p>body in the crowd said, 'Shoot' or 'Hang Gould,' and he says, 'No, a
</p>
<p>great many will jump up and take his place. What Socialism aims at is
</p>
<p>not the death of individuals, but of the system.'
</p>
<p>" Fielden spoke very loud, and as I had never attended a Socialistic meet-
</p>
<p>ing before in my life, I thought they were a little wild. Fielden spoke about a
</p>
<p>Congressman from Ohio who had been elected by the workingmen and con-
</p>
<p>fessed that no legislation could be enacted in favor of the workingmen ; con-
</p>
<p>sequently he said there was no use trying to do anything by legislation.
</p>
<p>After he had talked awhile a dark cloud with cold wind came from the
</p>
<p>north. Many people had left before, but when the cloud came a great
</p>
<p>many people left. Somebody said, 'Let's adjourn,' to some place, I can't
</p>
<p>remember the name of the place. Fielden said he was about through, there
</p>
<p>was no need of adjourning. He said two or three times, ' Now, in conclu-
</p>
<p>sion,' or something like that, and I became impatient. Then I heard a
</p>
<p>commotion and a good deal of noise in the audience, and somebody said,
</p>
<p>4 Police. ' I looked south and saw a line of police when it was at about the
</p>
<p>Randolph Street car-tracks. The police moved along until the front of the
</p>
<p>column got about up to the speakers' wagon. I heard somebody near the

<p>wagon say something about dispersing. I saw some persons upon the
</p>
<p>wagon. I could not tell who they were. About the time that somebody
</p>
<p>was giving that command to disperse, I distinctly heard two words coming
</p>
<p>from the vicinity of the wagon or from the wagon. I don't know who
</p>
<p>uttered them. The words were ' peaceable meeting.' That was a few sec-
</p>
<p>onds before the explosion of the bomb. As the police marched through the
</p>
<p>crowd the latter went to the sidewalks on either side, some went north,
</p>
<p>some few went on Randolph Street east, and some west. I did not hear
</p>
<p>any such exclamation as ' Here come the bloodhounds of the police ; you
</p>
<p>do your duty and I'll do mine,' from the locality of the wagon or from Mr.
</p>
<p>Fielden. I heard nothing of that sort that night. At the time the bomb
</p>
<p>exploded I was still in my position upon the stairs. A reporter talked to
</p>
<p>me while I was on those stairs. I remember he went down, and just before
</p>
<p>the police came he ran up past me again. There was no pistol fired by any
</p>
<p>person upon the wagon before the bomb exploded. No pistol shots any-
</p>
<p>where before the explosion of the bomb. Just after the command to dis-
</p>
<p>perse had been given, I saw a lighted fuse or something I didn't know
</p>
<p>what it was at the time come up from a point nearly twenty feet south of
</p>
<p>486 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>the south line of Crane's alley, from about the center of the sidewalk on the
</p>
<p>east side of the street, from behind some boxes. I am positive it was not
</p>
<p>thrown from the alley. I first noticed it about six or seven feet in the air,
</p>
<p>a little above a man's head. It went in a northwest course and up about
</p>
<p>fifteen feet from the ground, and fell about the middle of the street. The
</p>
<p>explosion followed almost immediately, possibly within two or three seconds.
</p>
<p>Something of a cloud of smoke followed the explosion. After the bomb ex-
</p>
<p>ploded there was pistol-shooting. From my position I could distinctly see
</p>
<p>the flashes of the pistols. My head was about fifteen feet from the ground.
</p>
<p>There might have been fifty to one hundred and fifty pistol shots. They
</p>
<p>proceeded from about the center of where the police were. I did not ob-
</p>
<p>serve either the flashes of pistol shots or hear the report of any shots from
</p>
<p>the crowd upon the police prior to the firing by the police. I staid in my
</p>
<p>position from five to twenty seconds. There was shooting going on in
</p>
<p>every direction, as well up as down. I could see from the flashes of the
</p>
<p>pistols that the police were shooting up. The police were not only shoot-
</p>
<p>ing at the crowd, but I noticed several of them shoot just as they happened
</p>
<p>to throw their arms. I concluded that my position was possibly more
</p>
<p>dangerous than down in the crowd, and then I ran down to the foot of the
</p>
<p>stairs, ran west on the sidewalk on Randolph Street a short distance, and
</p>
<p>then on the road. A crowd was running in the same direction. I had to
</p>
<p>jump over a man lying down, and I saw another man fall in front of me
</p>
<p>about one hundred and fifty to two hundred feet west of Desplaines Street.
</p>
<p>I took hold of his arm and wanted to help him, but the firing was so lively
</p>
<p>behind me that I just let go and ran. I was to the rear of the crowd run-
</p>
<p>ning west, the police still behind us. There were no shots from the direc-
</p>
<p>tion to which I was running.
</p>
<p>" I am not and have never been a member of any Socialistic party or
</p>
<p>association. Walking through the crowd before the meeting, I noticed
</p>
<p>from their appearance that the meeting was composed principally of ordi-
</p>
<p>nary workingmen, mechanics, etc. The audience listened, and once in
</p>
<p>awhile there would be yells of 'Shoot. him ! ' ' Hang him ! ' from the audi-
</p>
<p>ence. I didn't find any difference in the bearing of the crowd during
</p>
<p>Fielden's speech from what it was during Parsons' or Spies'. In the

<p>course of the conversation which I had with Capt. Bonfield at the station
</p>
<p>before the meeting that night, I asked him about the trouble in the south-
</p>
<p>western part of the city. He says, ' The trouble there is that these '-
</p>
<p>whether he used the word Socialists or strikers, I don't know 'get their
</p>
<p>women and children mixed up with them and around them and in front of
</p>
<p>them, and we can't get at them. I would like to get three thousand of
</p>
<p>them in a crowd, without their women and children' and to the best of
</p>
<p>my recollection he added, 'and I will make short work of them.' I noticed
</p>
<p>a few women and children at the bottom of the steps where I was. I don't
</p>
<p>think there were any in the bodv of the crowd around the wagon. At the
</p>
<p>time the police came up there, I did not observe any women or children."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination Mr. Simonson said :
</p>
<p>" I have several times visited police stations in the city. I attended a
</p>
<p>Salvation Army meeting on East Chicago Avenue, and I thought the
</p>
<p>roughs there interrupted the meeting. I went across to see Capt. Schaack
</p>
<p>two or three times about it. I was once at the Desplaines Street Station
</p>
<p>and made complaint against a policeman for abusing an old man, and one

<p>BARTON SIMONSON'S TESTIMONY. 487
</p>
<p>evening I brought there a fellow who asked me for something to get him a
</p>
<p>lodging on the West Side, and I asked the police to take care of him.
</p>
<p>And another time, when I heard about the way people who had received
</p>
<p>lodging at the station were treated there, I went to the station to satisfy
</p>
<p>myself what was the fact about the matter, and Capt. Ward told me a dif-
</p>
<p>ferent story.
</p>
<p>"I went to the Haymarket meeting out of curiosity to know what kind
</p>
<p>of meetings they held, believing that the newspapers ordinarily misrepre-
</p>
<p>sented such things. I had my impression that the papers had misrepre-
</p>
<p>sented the meetings of workingmen, not from anything definite I had, but
</p>
<p>from having seen reports in papers of occurrences I had seen, and, as a
</p>
<p>rule, they were onesided. I went to the meeting to satisfy myself to
</p>
<p>prove or disprove my impression. That was one of my reasons for going
</p>
<p>there. At that conversation with Mr. Bonfield that I testified to, nobody
</p>
<p>else was present. It was in the main office of Desplaines Street Station.
</p>
<p>Capt. Ward, I believe, was walking around at the time. There was a good
</p>
<p>deal of noise in the police station, and we talked quietly. I believe no one
</p>
<p>else could hear it. I believe it was last fall that I visited the North Side
</p>
<p>police station in regard to the Salvation Army again. I visited about a
</p>
<p>half dozen of their meetings. I saw Capt. Schaack at the station. I did
</p>
<p>not ask him to arrest any people who had disturbed the meeting, nor to
</p>
<p>arrest the Salvation Army people. I told him that in going to the meet-
</p>
<p>ing I heard somebody swear a very vicious oath and curse the Salvation
</p>
<p>Army people. The police were standing within hearing, and the crowd
</p>
<p>joined in the laugh. I told him it seemed to me that the police ought not
</p>
<p>to allow anything of that kind. The windows of the Salvation Army were
</p>
<p>filled with boards. I told Capt. Schaack that it seemed not right that in
</p>
<p>front of the police station they should do any such thing. He said he
</p>
<p>would order the boards taken down, and if they wanted protection they
</p>
<p>could get it. I went another time to Capt. Schaack when some of the Sal-
</p>
<p>vation Army people were confined in the Bridewell. Mayor Harrison had
</p>
<p>given me a note to Mr. Felton, telling him to let them go, and I went to
</p>
<p>Capt. Schaack to tell him that.
</p>
<p>"My recollection is that Fielden said : 'The law is your enemy. Kill

</p>
<p>it, stab it, throttle it, or it will throttle you.' When the police came, I
</p>
<p>looked at them and at the crowd. I watched both to some extent. I don't
</p>
<p>know how many lines of police there were. When I saw them at the Ran-
</p>
<p>dolph Street tracks, I saw a straight line of police filling the whole street.
</p>
<p>There was more than one column, but I don't know how many. I was at
</p>
<p>that time contemplating the question of my own safety. I was looking in
</p>
<p>the direction of the wagon at the time the bomb was thrown. I didn't see
</p>
<p>the officer command the meeting to disperse, but heard somebody, in some
</p>
<p>form, tell the meeting to disperse. The only words I remember to have
</p>
<p>heard were: 'Command meeting to disperse.' During the delivery
</p>
<p>of that, or right after it, I heard somebody say something, of which I caught
</p>
<p>the two words, 'Peaceable meeting.' The first column of police were
</p>
<p>standing on about a line with the north line of the alley. I don't know
</p>
<p>where the other columns were with reference to where the bomb exploded.
</p>
<p>I only saw the police in a large body march out. It looked to me at the
</p>
<p>time as if the bomb struck the ground and exploded just a little behind the
</p>
<p>front line of police. I saw policemen behind the first line of police, but I
</p>
<p>did not distinguish the columns. I don't know whether the bomb exploded

</p>
<p>directl)' behind the front line, or between the second and the third or third
</p>
<p>and fourth lines.
</p>
<p>" The firing began from the police, right in the center of the street. I
</p>
<p>did not see a single shot fired from the crowd on either side of the street.
</p>
<p>I didn't know what became of the men in the wagon. I don't think there
</p>
<p>were any shots fired in the neighborhood of the wagon. I was not looking
</p>
<p>at the wagon all the time, but was looking over the scene in general. If
</p>
<p>you got up on a place as high as I was, and it was dark, you could see
</p>
<p>every flash ; the flashes show themselves immediately when they are out of
</p>
<p>the revolver, on a dark night. The scene impressed itself so upon me that
</p>
<p>now, looking back, I see it as I did then. Looking at where the bomb ex-
</p>
<p>ploded, I could not help looking toward the wagon, too. My impression is,
</p>
<p>the boxes on the opposite side of the street were from two to four feet high.
</p>
<p>I have been at the Haymarket to look over the ground, several times since
</p>
<p>the 4th of May, so as to get an idea of the dimensions of the thing. I went
</p>
<p>there of my own volition ; nobody asked me to go there. It was on my way
</p>
<p>to mother's house. I am employed by Rothschild Brothers, on commission."
</p>
<p>When this witness returned to the store, the firm by whom he was em-
</p>
<p>ployed at once discharged him, saying that he was one of the worst Anarch-
</p>
<p>ists in the city and they had no use for him.
</p>
<p>JOHN FERGUSON, a resident of Chicago for seventeen years, and in the
</p>
<p>cloak business, passed the Haymarket, and, noticing a crowd there, stopped
</p>
<p>to listen to the speeches. He was accompanied by an acquaintance. They
</p>
<p>stood at the Randolph Street crossing and listened about fifteen minutes to
</p>
<p>Parsons' speech. Said the witness :
</p>
<p>"We could hear all of the speaking plainly, from where we stood, as the
</p>
<p>speakers were facing Randolph Street. During his speech, when he men-
</p>
<p>tioned Jay Gould's name, somebody said : ' Throw him in the lake ; ' and a
</p>
<p>man standing almost in front of me took his pipe from his mouth and hal-
</p>
<p>loaed out : ' Hang him.' Parsons replied that would do no good ; a dozen
</p>
<p>more Jay Goulds would spring up in his place. ' Socialism aims not at the
</p>
<p>life of individuals, but at the system.' I didn't hear any other responses
</p>
<p>from the crowd than those I mentioned. After Parsons concluded, another
</p>
<p>gentleman got up and began speaking about Congressman Foran. After a

</p>
<p>few minutes I saw quite a storm cloud come up. Some one interrupted the
</p>
<p>speaker with the remark : ' There is a prospect of immediate storm, and
</p>
<p>those of you who wish to continue the meeting can adjourn to ' some hall,
</p>
<p>I don't remember the name of it ; but the speaker, resuming, said : ' I
</p>
<p>haven't but two or three words more to say, and then you can go home.' I
</p>
<p>walked away from the meeting, across Randolph Street to the southwest
</p>
<p>corner. There I saw the police rush out from the station in a body. They
</p>
<p>whirled into the street and came down very rapidly toward us. The gen-
</p>
<p>tleman in command of the police was swinging his arm and told them to
</p>
<p>hurry up. After they had passed us we turned to walk south toward the
</p>
<p>station, and we heard a slight report, something like breaking boards, or like
</p>
<p>slapping a brick down on the pavement. We turned, and we had just about
</p>
<p>faced around, looking at the crowd, when we saw a fire flying out about six
</p>
<p>or eight feet above the heads of the crowd and falling down pretty near the
</p>
<p>center of the street. It was all dark for almost a second, perhaps, then
</p>
<p>there was a deafening roar. Then almost instantly we saw flashes from
</p>
<p>LUDWIG ZELLERS TESTIMONY. 489
</p>
<p>toward the middle of the street, south of Randolph on Desplaines, and
</p>
<p>heard reports. That side of the street where the crowd was was dark.
</p>
<p>At that time there did not appear to be any light there. Then we hurried
</p>
<p>away. I did not see any flashes from either side of the street. The majority
</p>
<p>of the crowd had gone away on the appearance of the approaching storm.
</p>
<p>The crowd was very orderly, as orderly a meeting as I ever saw anywhere
</p>
<p>in the street.
</p>
<p>"It could not have been longer than five minutes from the time that
</p>
<p>Fielden said, 'We will be through in a short time,' that the police marched
</p>
<p>down the street. I am not a Socialist, nor an Anarchist, nor a Communist;
</p>
<p>I don't know anything about what those terms mean."
</p>
<p>LUDWIG ZELLER went to the meeting about a quarter past ten, and took
</p>
<p>a position at a lamp-post near Crane's alley. A few minutes thereafter the
</p>
<p>police came, and when they passed him he heard the command of the Cap-
</p>
<p>tain, but heard no reply from anybody on the wagon or near the wagon.
</p>
<p>" I turned and went south to Randolph Street, and in turning I saw a
</p>
<p>light go through the air about six, or eight, or ten feet south of the lamp.
</p>
<p>It went in a northwesterly direction, right into the middle of the street and
</p>
<p>in the middle of the police ; then I heard an explosion and shooting, and I
</p>
<p>tried to get out, because there were a great many men falling around me,
</p>
<p>and a few were crying. I turned the corner on Randolph Street east
</p>
<p>toward Clinton. A great many people were running in the same direction ;
</p>
<p>men were falling before me and on the side of me. I heard shooting imme-
</p>
<p>diately upon the explosion of the bomb. The shots came from behind me
</p>
<p>while I ran. The shots came from the center of the street, from north and
</p>
<p>northwest of me.
</p>
<p>"On Sunday, May 2d, I was present at a meeting of the Central Labor
</p>
<p>Union as a delegate from the Cigar-makers' Union, No. 15. The delegates
</p>
<p>of the Lumber-shovers' Union at that meeting requested me, as a member
</p>
<p>of the agitation committee, to send a speaker to a meeting of the Lumber-
</p>
<p>shovers' Union to be held on Monday, May 3d, at the Black Road. They
</p>
<p>wanted a good speaker, who could keep the meeting quiet and orderly. In
</p>
<p>the afternoon of the same day we had another meeting of the Central Labor
</p>
<p>Union, at which Mr. Spies was present as a reporter of the Arbeiter-Zeitung,

</p>
<p>and I told him personally to go out to the meeting of the Lumber-shovers'
</p>
<p>Union and speak in the name of the Central Labor Union. The Central
</p>
<p>Labor Union is a body composed of delegates from about twenty-five or
</p>
<p>thirty different labor unions of the city. The Lumber-shovers' Union is
</p>
<p>represented in the Central Labor Union by delegates. There are from
</p>
<p>fifteen to sixteen thousand laborers represented by those unions. The
</p>
<p>agitation committee to which I belonged was for the purpose of organizing
</p>
<p>different branches of trade who had no eight-hour organization at that time.
</p>
<p>I did not notice any firing back from the crowd at the police, either on Des-
</p>
<p>plaines Street or Randolph Street."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination Mr. Zeller stated :
</p>
<p>" Since last December, I don't belong to any group. Prior to that I was
</p>
<p>a member of the group ' Freiheit,' which used to meet on Sherman Street.
</p>
<p>I only attended three meetings of that group. We had no numbers. I am
</p>
<p>not an Anarchist. I am a Socialist.
</p>
<p>490 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>" I was standing about five or six feet south of that alley. I saw the
</p>
<p>fuse about eight or ten feet south of me. I didn't know what it was. I saw
</p>
<p>behind that fuse something dark, but I couldn't distinguish what it was.
</p>
<p>I was only looking where it was going. I cannot say what kind of looking
</p>
<p>thing it was ; it seems to me it was more round, and about as big as a base-
</p>
<p>ball. I cannot say who fired first after the bomb went off. I can't say
</p>
<p>exactly whether the police fired I didn't see. On the wagon I only recog-
</p>
<p>nized Fielden. I was too far away from the wagon, and it was dark. The
</p>
<p>gas-light was lighted. I didn't see anybody put it out. "
</p>
<p>Carl Richter and F. Liebel gave practical!)' similar stories of the riot.
</p>
<p>The point which the defense seemed to wish to bring out in their testimony
</p>
<p>was that the gravamen lay rather with the police than with the Anarchists.
</p>
<p>They swore that, although standing close to the famous wagon, they had
</p>
<p>heard nothing about ' ' bloodhounds. "
</p>
<p>Along this line, also, was the evidence of Dr. James D. Taylor, who gave
</p>
<p>a practically identical account of the explosion. This gentleman, however,
</p>
<p>seemed to be certain that the police had attacked the crowd. He had ex-
</p>
<p>amined the scene of the riot on the next day and found that the bullet
</p>
<p>marks on the buildings came chiefly from the direction from which the
</p>
<p>police had charged. Quite a point was made by the Anarchists upon the
</p>
<p>fact that a telegraph pole, which was said to have thoroughly borne out Dr.
</p>
<p>Taylor's testimony, had disappeared from the Haymarket. It was insinuated
</p>
<p>that the prosecution had made away with this pole. The fact was that the
</p>
<p>pole had been very prosaically, and in the common course of business, re-
</p>
<p>moved by the telegraph company.
</p>
<p>Frank Stenner, Joseph Gutscher and Frank Raab gave their memories
</p>
<p>of the riot, all agreeing closely with the theory of the defense. Wm. Urban,
</p>
<p>a compositor on the Ar better- Zeitung, after telling the same story, swore that
</p>
<p>he saw something shining which he believed were revolvers in the
</p>
<p>hands of the police as they came up toward the meeting. The story of the
</p>
<p>explosion and the murder of the police, from the Anarchists' point of view,
</p>
<p>was also detailed by Wm. Gleason, Wm. Sahl, Eberhard Hierzemenzel,
</p>
<p>Conrad Messer and August Krumm. This last witness, Krumm, also testi-
</p>

<p>alley, at the time that the bomb was thrown, which, it will be remembered,
</p>
<p>Gilmer swore had been fired in this alley by Spies and Schnaubelt and
</p>
<p>Krumm declared that there was nobody in that little thoroughfare then save
</p>
<p>his friend and himself.
</p>
<p>This was not the only attack on Gilmer's veracity. Lucius M. Moses
</p>
<p>had known Harry Gilmer six or seven years and would not believe him on
</p>
<p>oath. John O. Brixey stated on the stand that Gilmer's reputation was bad
</p>
<p>and that he was not worthy of belief. John Garrick, an ex-deputy sheriff,
</p>
<p>knew Gilmer and would not believe him on oath. Mrs. B. P. Lee was an-
</p>
<p>other who had no confidence in Gilmer's truth and veracity.

<p>THE evidence so far produced for the defendants showed that their
</p>
<p>counsel had done everything possible in their efforts to offset the
</p>
<p>damaging testimony of the State. They proved themselves not only fertile
</p>
<p>in resources, but ingenious in the selection of witnesses and in the manner
</p>
<p>of presenting their points before the jury. It was no fault of theirs that
</p>
<p>they failed to make "the worse appear the better reason." They labored
</p>
<p>incessantly for the cause of their clients, and they certainly called the best
</p>
<p>witnesses that could be found among the Anarchists and their sympathizers.
</p>
<p>ROBERT LINDINGER lived with Carl Richter and accompanied him to the
</p>
<p>Haymarket meeting. He stood at the mouth of the alley and saw at the
</p>
<p>meeting Spies, Parsons and Fielden. He did not see the gentleman on
</p>
<p>trial (indicating Schwab) ; had never seen him before in his life, and he
</p>
<p>(Schwab) was not on the wagon when Spies was there. He did not hear any-
</p>
<p>body say, " Here come the bloodhounds," etc., saw no one in the crowd fire
</p>
<p>any shots, and saw no pistol in Fielden's hand. Witness was a cornice-
</p>
<p>maker, and had been in ' the country about three years. He was not a
</p>
<p>Socialist, but read the Arbeiter-Zeitung.
</p>
<p>WILLIAM ALBRIGHT, who stood in the alley with Krumm, stated sub-
</p>
<p>stantially the same facts as given by his companion.
</p>
<p>M. D. MALKOFF, a reporter for the Arbeiter-Zeitung, up to the 5th of
</p>
<p>May, saw Parsons at Zepf's Hall from five to ten minutes before the ex-
</p>
<p>plosion of the bomb. Said he :
</p>
<p>"He was sitting at the window, north of the entrance door, in company
</p>
<p>with Mrs. Parsons and Mrs. Holmes. The saloon was pretty crowded at
</p>
<p>that time. I spoke with Mr. Allen about these parties. I think Mrs.
</p>
<p>Holmes was standing and Mrs. Parsons was sitting on the window-sill right
</p>
<p>on the side of Mr. Parsons. I saw them there when I heard the explosion
</p>
<p>of the bomb."

</p>
<p>On cross-examination Mr. Malkoff said :
</p>
<p>"I have been five years in the country ; in Chicago about two years and
</p>
<p>a half. When I first came to the country, I was private teacher of the
</p>
<p>Russian language in Brooklyn. I taught Paesig, the editor of the Brooklyn
</p>
<p>Freie Presse. He is not a revolutionist ; his paper is not a revolutionary one.
</p>
<p>Then I went to Little Rock for about half a year, working as a printer for
</p>
<p>the Arkansas Staats-Zeitung. Then I went to St. Louis for about three
</p>
<p>492 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>months, found no work there, and came to Chicago. I had no letter of
</p>
<p>introduction to Spies when I came here. I had obtained my position at
</p>
<p>Little Rock through a letter of introduction from Mr. Spies, whom I knew
</p>
<p>by some correspondence in regard to a novel which Mr. Paesig and I trans-
</p>
<p>lated and sold to the Arbeiter-Zeitung. It was not a revolutionary novel. I
</p>
<p>did not get that letter of introduction from Mr. Spies through Herr Most.
</p>
<p>I have seen Most, but don't know him personally. I know Justus Schwab.
</p>
<p>I did not live with him, but had letters directed to his care. When I came
</p>
<p>to Chicago I went directly to Spies. For about half a year I was without
</p>
<p>employment ; then, for a year and a half, up to May 4th, I was reporter on
</p>
<p>the Arbeiter-Zeitung. I roomed with Balthasar Rau for about four months ;
</p>
<p>part of that time was after the Haymarket meeting. I had been at Zepf's
</p>
<p>Hall for more than an hour before I heard the bomb explode, part of the
</p>
<p>time in the saloon, part of the time attending the meeting up-stairs. When
</p>
<p>I came down again in the saloon it was a good half hour before the bomb
</p>
<p>exploded. I was there alone, standing near the counter, where I had one
</p>
<p>glass of beer. When I was talking with Mr. Allen, we stood on the floor
</p>
<p>between the stove and the bar.
</p>
<p>"When the bomb exploded we made a few steps toward the rear. Mr.
</p>
<p>Allen thought it was a Gatling gun ; it sounded like a Gatling gun. A few
</p>
<p>seconds after that the shooting began, and a good many people came to
</p>
<p>the hall. A good many had been there before that. When the crowd came,
</p>
<p>we rushed out the back door.
</p>
<p>" I did not belong to any Nihilistic organization in Russia. I was not a
</p>
<p>Nihilist in Russia. I am not in this country as the agent of the Nihilists,
</p>
<p>or any other society in Russia. The reporters used to call me a Nihilist
</p>
<p>because I was a Russian, that is all. This letter here (indicating) is in my
</p>
<p>handwriting, and has my signature at the bottom. I don't remember to
</p>
<p>whom I wrote it. I am now working for the Moscow Gazette, an illustrated
</p>
<p>paper."
</p>
<p>A translation of the letter heretofore referred to was introduced in evi-
</p>
<p>dence, as follows :
</p>
<p>DEAR MR. EDITOR: The articles I send you herewith you may read, put them into
</p>
<p>proper form, and, if you consider them competent, reprint them in one of your papers. I

</p>
<p>have also nearly completed a very interesting article treating of the secret revolutionary
</p>
<p>societies of Russia, in the so-called Dekabrists that is, of 1820 to 1830. I have also
</p>
<p>another one in my thoughts, but, being out of work, and having no dwelling-place, it is
</p>
<p>entirely impossible to give even a few hours daily to writing. You see, I am writing in
</p>
<p>German, which I can do i. e., I translate every sentence, word for word, from the Russian.
</p>
<p>You have in this connection the not easy task to set the corrupted German right. I hope
</p>
<p>you will pardon me for this. At the time I came over here I did not understand one
</p>
<p>German word. Thanks to Wassilisson, which I translated with the help of a dictionary, I
</p>
<p>have learned this little. For your letter I am very thankful to you. I would, of course, fol-
</p>
<p>low your accommodating invitation, and would have left New York long ago, but unfortun-
</p>
<p>ately it does not depend upon me. I am a proletarian in the fullest sense of the word, and
</p>
<p>a proletarian is not favored to put his ideas into execution.
</p>
<p>Respectfully, MICHAEL MALKOFF.
</p>
<p>Care of J. H. Schwab, 50 First Street, New York. Written on the aad of October, 1883.
</p>
<p>WILLIAM A. PATTERSON, a printer, attended the meeting at No. 107
</p>
<p>Fifth Avenue, on the evening of May 4, in response to an advertisement in
</p>
<p>THE DYNAMITE CLOSET. 493
</p>
<p>the Daily News, and said it was for the purpose of organizing the working
</p>
<p>women of Chicago. While there, a telephone message came for a speaker
</p>
<p>at Deering, and a clerk in the office answered it. That was a little after
</p>
<p>eight o'clock. They wanted a German speaker, and Schwab's name was
</p>
<p>mentioned. After that, witness said, he did not see Schwab. There was
</p>
<p>also a call for speakers at the Haymarket. Those present at the Fifth
</p>
<p>Avenue meeting were Parsons, Fielden, Mrs. Parsons, Mrs. Holmes,
</p>
<p>Schwab, Waldo, Brown, Snyder and some others.
</p>
<p>HENRY LINDEMEYER, a mason, testified through an interpreter. He
</p>
<p>occasionally did calcimining, and, while working at that in the Arbeiter-
</p>
<p>Zeitung, had occasion to place some things on a shelf in the closet off the
</p>
<p>editorial room. He missed a brush, and looked for it on a shelf in that
</p>
<p>closet. He found some papers, which he took down, but he did not find
</p>
<p>his brush. "I found," said he, "no bundle, no large package, no dynamite
</p>
<p>on the shelf. Saw no indication of greasiness there."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination he testified :
</p>
<p>" I have known Spies for seven or eight years. I am on the bond of his
</p>
<p>brother, who is charged with conspiracy growing out of the Haymarket
</p>
<p>trouble. I have known Schwab three or four years. Saw him at public
</p>
<p>meetings, at Turner Hall and other halls. I saw Spies nearly every day.
</p>
<p>He lives in my neighborhood since quite a time. I have been a subscriber
</p>
<p>to the Arbeiter-Zeitung since it is in existence. The closet was in the south-
</p>
<p>east part of the room, about four or five feet square, and about eleven or
</p>
<p>twelve feet high, as high as the room. There was only one shelf in the
</p>
<p>closet. There was a wash-stand in there, under which I kept some things.
</p>
<p>I had calcimined that room a few weeks before. On the 2d of May I cal-
</p>
<p>cimined the upper floor. On the 5th of May I calcimined the library. I
</p>
<p>left my things in the closet from the 2d to the forenoon of the 5th of May.
</p>
<p>When the police came I took them to some other place. The things I left
</p>
<p>in that closet were my working-clothes and my tools. My hat and my vest
</p>
<p>I had on the upper part of the shelf, and the rest on the floor. When I
</p>
<p>examined the shelf, I found nothing but a small package of papers, cover-
</p>
<p>ing as much space as the size of an open paper, occupying about one-quar-
</p>
<p>ter of the shelf. I didn't feel on the bottom of the shelf to see if there was

</p>
<p>any grease on it. There was no grease on there ; else I wouldn't have put
</p>
<p>my clothes there. The shelf was about six feet from the ground."
</p>
<p>EDWARD LEHNERT, testifying through an interpreter, said :
</p>
<p>"I know Schnaubelt, and saw him at the Haymarket that night about
</p>
<p>ten o'clock. I was standing on the west side of Desplaines Street, about
</p>
<p>thirty paces from Randolph, about twenty paces south of the wagon. I saw
</p>
<p>Schnaubelt about the time when it grew dark and cloudy. I had a conver-
</p>
<p>sation with him at that time, at the place where I stood. The speaking
</p>
<p>was still going on. It was before the bomb exploded. August Krueger
</p>
<p>was present. I mean Rudolph Schnaubelt, this man (indicating photograph
</p>
<p>of Schnaubelt)."
</p>
<p>"What was the conversation? '
</p>
<p>The State objected.
</p>
<p>494 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>Mr. Zeisler "We offer to show by this witness that Schnaubelt stated
</p>
<p>to Lehnert that he did not understand English ; that he had expected a
</p>
<p>German speaker would be present ; that no one was present who spoke
</p>
<p>German except Spies ; that Spies had already made an English speech, and
</p>
<p>that he did not want to stay any longer, and asked Lehnert if he would go
</p>
<p>along ; that Lehnert thereupon said he did not go in the same direction ;
</p>
<p>and that then Schnaubelt went away with another party. We have been
</p>
<p>able to trace Schnaubelt only for a short distance on his way home. We
</p>
<p>offer this conversation with Lehnert for the purpose of explaining Mr.
</p>
<p>Schnaubelt's movements after meeting Lehnert."
</p>
<p>The objection was sustained.
</p>
<p>WILLIAM SNYDER, indicted for conspiracy in connection with the Hay-
</p>
<p>market riot, and in jail since the 8th of May, said :
</p>
<p>" I am a Socialist, a member of the American group of the Inter-
</p>
<p>nationale since it was organized. I am acquainted with all the defendants
</p>
<p>except Lingg. I saw Parsons and Fielden on Tuesday night, May 4 last,
</p>
<p>at the Arbeiter-Zeitung building on Fifth Avenue. I had gone there pur-
</p>
<p>suant to a notice of a meeting of the American group in the paper. I knew
</p>
<p>nothing of this meeting of the group before I read the notice in the paper.
</p>
<p>The meeting was called to order about half-past eight. Before that we had
</p>
<p>waited for some time for Mr. and Mrs. Parsons. They finally came about
</p>
<p>half-past eight. I was elected chairman. I asked the purpose for which
</p>
<p>the meeting was called. The general topic of consideration was to get
</p>
<p>money from the treasury for the purpose of furthering the organization of
</p>
<p>the sewing girls of this city through Mrs. Parsons and Mrs. Holmes. The
</p>
<p>meeting lasted about half an hour ; then nearly all of us went over to the
</p>
<p>Haymarket meeting. I don't remember seeing Schwab at that meeting.
</p>
<p>We walked over." Witness got on the wagon and when the police came, he
</p>
<p>said, he got down first in front of Fielden. Fielden did not shoot; he
</p>
<p>would have killed me if he had shot; I was south of him." They both
</p>
<p>started for the alley, and there witness lost sight of Fielden. He heard no
</p>
<p>reference to bloodhounds and saw no one shooting except the police.
</p>
<p>On cross-examination Snyder said :
</p>
<p>" I used to make addresses to the working people. Never missed an

</p>
<p>opportunity to show the injustice which they are laboring under. I have
</p>
<p>been chairman of the American group ; addressed meetings of the group
</p>
<p>from time to time. I never talked to people on the lake front. I read the
</p>
<p>Alarm every time it came out."
</p>
<p>" How long have you been a Socialist ? "
</p>
<p>" Well, I was born one."
</p>
<p>THOMAS BROWN, arrested for conspiracy, belonged to the Internationale
</p>
<p>for about a year and a half, and after Parsons had spoken at the Haymarket
</p>
<p>he and Parsons went to Zepf's saloon. When the bomb exploded, they
</p>
<p>were sitting there at a table. Fischer was there at the time. On cross-
</p>
<p>examination Brown said :
</p>
<p>" I was born in Ireland ; came to this country some thirty-four years ago.
</p>
<p>The first organization of Socialists I joined was in the city of Chicago, about
</p>
<p>1881. I did not know Parsons at that time. I became acquainted with
</p>
<p>HENRY SPIES' TESTIMONY. 495
</p>
<p>Parsons about two or two and a half years ago. When the bomb exploded,
</p>
<p>Parsons and I jumped up. I did not go out with Parsons from the rear
</p>
<p>door. I did not go out until some time after the explosion. I next saw
</p>
<p>Parsons on the corner of Kinzie and Desplaines Streets, when he was with
</p>
<p>Mrs. Parsons and Mrs. Holmes. Parsons asked me what I would do in his
</p>
<p>case. We separated on the corner. I went north, and I think Parsons went
</p>
<p>east."
</p>
<p>" What was the conversation you had with Parsons ? "
</p>
<p>"I told him I would leave for a while, under the circumstances. He
</p>
<p>said : 'What do you think I had better do?' I told him : 'Suit yourself,
</p>
<p>you are your own boss. You must use your own judgment.' I then loaned
</p>
<p>him five dollars. Parsons did not say to me that he could not get away
</p>
<p>because he had no money. He simply asked me for five dollars, and I lent
</p>
<p>it to him. I did not state to the State's Attorney, at the Central Station, in
</p>
<p>the presence of Mr. Furthmann, James Bonfield, Lieut. Shea and others,
</p>
<p>that Parsons had said he had no money to get away with ; that I advised
</p>
<p>him to go, and that I would lend him five dollars. I used to buy the Alarm
</p>
<p>every time it came out, and used to read it. I had stock in the paper."
</p>
<p>HENRY W. SPIES, a cigar manufacturer, brother of the defendant, went
</p>
<p>to the Haymarket with his brother. When his brother got off the wagon to
</p>
<p>hunt for Parsons, they went in a northwesterly direction from the wagon,
</p>
<p>but Schwab was not there.
</p>
<p>" Schnaubelt and my brother went together, and I and Legner followed
</p>
<p>right behind them. After asking, ' Is Parsons here? ' and descending from
</p>
<p>the wagon, August did not go in the direction of Crane's Alley, nor into
</p>
<p>Crane's Alley. He went as far as Union Street, and in fact got down on the
</p>
<p>side of the wagon, pretty near the middle of it. Just at that time the ex-
</p>
<p>plosion took place. I asked him what it was. He said, ' They have got a
</p>
<p>Gatling gun down there,' and at the same time, as he jumped, somebody
</p>
<p>jumped behind him with a weapon, right by his back, and I grabbed it, and
</p>
<p>in warding off the pistol from my brother I was shot. I don't know who did
</p>
<p>the shooting. I didn't see August any more until I went home. I went to
</p>
<p>Zepf's Hall, though, and inquired for him. August did not leave the wagon
</p>
<p>about the time the police came, or at any time, and go into the alley. Leg-

</p>
<p>ner and myself helped him off the wagon just as the explosion came. The
</p>
<p>firing came from the street."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination the witness testified :
</p>
<p>" On the 6th of May I was arrested at my house by Officers Whalen and
</p>
<p>Loewenstein. I told them when the bomb exploded I was at Zepf's Hall,
</p>
<p>walked out and was shot in the door. I told them I was not at the Hay-
</p>
<p>market at all, from beginning to end. That was not true when I told it to
</p>
<p>them. I lied to them. I have told the truth now, when I was under oath.
</p>
<p>I was afterwards brought down to the Central Station, about the gth or loth
</p>
<p>of May. I was there interrogated by either Mr. Grinnell or Mr. Furthmann,
</p>
<p>in the presence of Lieuts. Shea and Kipley. I was asked .whether I was a
</p>
<p>Socialist. I don't believe I said I was not. I asked whether you could tell
</p>
<p>me what a Socialist was. I. said I had been on business at Zepf's saloon,
</p>
<p>which is a fact. I told you that I was down there for the purpose of collect-
</p>
<p>ing a bill. That was true when I said it. I also told you I was down there
</p>
<p>and did a large dealing in cigars. I also stated at that time and place that
</p>
<p>4 g6 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>I was not at the Haymarket from the beginning, but was in Zepf's saloon,
</p>
<p>and was shot when I came out of the door at Zepf's. I also said that I did
</p>
<p>not see my brother that evening until he called at the house and asked me
</p>
<p>if I had a good physician. I now state that what I then said about that was
</p>
<p>not the truth. I was not under oath then, and I knew the treatment which
</p>
<p>my brothers had found."
</p>
<p>AUGUST KnuEGERsaid:
</p>
<p>" I saw there the man represented on this picture (Schnaubelt). When
</p>
<p>I saw him I was standing with Mr. Lehnert on the west side of Desplaines
</p>
<p>Street, about thirty to forty feet north of Randolph. I saw that man about
</p>
<p>ten o'clock ; he came from the northeast. I didn't know at the time what
</p>
<p>his name was, although I knew him well. Mr. Furthmann since told me his
</p>
<p>name is Schnaubelt. Schnaubelt stayed there about five minutes. He
</p>
<p>wanted to go home, and wanted me to go along, and I went with him down
</p>
<p>on Randolph Street to Clinton. There I left him ; he went further east on
</p>
<p>Randolph Street, and I turned north on Clinton Street. This is the last I
</p>
<p>saw of Schnaubelt. I walked down Milwaukee Avenue and went to Engel's
</p>
<p>house. I reached it about fifteen minutes past ten I don't remember
</p>
<p>exactly. Mr. and Mrs. Engel were there. I stayed there and drank a pint
</p>
<p>of beer. Later Gottfried Waller came in and said he came from the Hay-
</p>
<p>market, and that 300 men were shot by the police, and we ought to go down
</p>
<p>there and do something. Engel said whoever threw that bomb did a fool-
</p>
<p>ish thing ; it was nonsense, and he didn't sympathize with such a butchery,
</p>
<p>and he told Waller he had better go home as quick as possible."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination Krueger said he was known as " Little Krueger."
</p>
<p>"I am an Anarchist. I was arrested for a day at the North Side sta-
</p>
<p>tion. I had a conversation there with Capt. Schaack and Mr. Furthmann.
</p>
<p>I was shown a picture of Schnaubelt at that time. I was asked whether I
</p>
<p>had ever seen that man. I don't know whether I answered, ' I might have
</p>
<p>seen him,' or what I answered. I know I had seen him. There were sev-
</p>
<p>eral other officers present at the conversation ; I don't know their names.
</p>
<p>I told Mr. Furthmann there that I was not at the Haymarket; I told him
</p>
<p>I was at Engel's house. I don't remember what I stated in regard to the
</p>
<p>time when I got to Engel's house. It may be that I told him that I got to

<p>Engel's house at nine o'clock and staid there until eleven, but I don't
</p>
<p>remember."
</p>
<p>ALBERT PRUESSER stated that he telephoned three times to the Arbeiter-
</p>
<p>Zeitung for a speaker for the meeting at Lake View. The committee from
</p>
<p>the Deering factory wanted Spies. Witness was told that Spies could not
</p>
<p>come, and he said it would make no difference if they sent some one else.
</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later he telephoned again and received a reply that
</p>
<p>Schwab was on the way. He went to meet Schwab at the Clybourn Ave-
</p>
<p>nue car. He met him on the rear platform of the car. That was half past
</p>
<p>nine o'clock, or twenty minutes to ten. They went to Radtke's saloon, 888
</p>
<p>Clybourn Avenue, remained there ten minutes, and then Schwab went to
</p>
<p>the prairie and spoke. He spoke about twenty minutes. When he got
</p>
<p>through they went and had lunch and beer at Schilling's saloon. Schwab

</p>
<p>then took a car for the city. It takes forty-five minutes to reach the corner
</p>
<p>of Clark and Washington Streets, and ten minutes to the Haymarket if there
</p>
<p>is no interruption. On cross-examination Pruesser stated that he had been
</p>
<p>a carrier for the Arbeiter-Zeitung for a time.
</p>
<p>JOHANN GRUENEBERG testified that he was an intimate friend of Fischer's.
</p>
<p>He went to the printing establishment of Wehrer & Klein at Fischer's re-
</p>
<p>quest and got some circulars with the line : " Workingmen, arm yourselves
</p>
<p>and come in full force." He took them to the compositors' room in the
</p>
<p>Arbeiter-Zeitung and then took some down to Spies. Fischer, Spies and
</p>
<p>witness had some conversation, and then he took an order from Fischer to
</p>
<p>Wehrer & Klein to leave out that line. On cross-examination Grueneberg
</p>
<p>stated :
</p>
<p>" I came to this country from Germany four years ago. I have lived in
</p>
<p>Chicago two years. I am a carpenter."
</p>
<p>" Where did the armed section of the Northwest group drill ? "
</p>
<p>" I don't know an armed section of the Northwest group. I don't know
</p>
<p>of a single time that the Northwest group drilled. I know of a paper called
</p>
<p>the Anarchist. I distributed it three or four times. I saw Fischer on Mon-
</p>
<p>day, May 3, between five and half-past five, at the Arbeiter-Zeitung, in the
</p>
<p>compositors' room. I did not see Fischer at any other place on Monday.
</p>
<p>I saw him on Sunday afternoon at my house, 570 West Superior Street. I
</p>
<p>did not see him Sunday morning at any place."
</p>
<p>" Were you at home all the morning yourself ? "
</p>
<p>The defense objected to this question.
</p>
<p>The Court " You have put this witness on the stand for the purpose of
</p>
<p>showing a thing was taken out, a particular circular. Whether he has told
</p>
<p>that thing as it occurred depends in some degree upon what his associa-
</p>
<p>tions, feelings, inclinations, biases are in reference to the whole business."
</p>
<p>Mr. Black "Whether he has told the truth in regard to that depends
</p>
<p>upon his bias and inclinations? "
</p>
<p>The Court "Whether it is to be believed I don't mean whether he
</p>
<p>has told the truth."
</p>
<p>" I don't remember whether I was home on that Sunday morning," con-
</p>
<p>tinued the witness. " I was not on Emma Street that Sunday morning. I

<p>have known Spies a year and a half ; saw him at the Arbeiter-Zeitung and
</p>
<p>at several Socialistic meetings ; once at our group, the other times I don't
</p>
<p>remember where. I have known Neebe for a short time by sight. I have
</p>
<p>known Schwab as long as Spies ; saw him at our group. He did not belong
</p>
<p>to the group. He made a speech once every few months. I know Lingg
</p>
<p>since the ist of May. I met him at the Carpenters' Union, not any other
</p>
<p>place."
</p>
<p>MRS. LIZZIE MAY HOLMES, assistant editor of the Alarm for about a
</p>
<p>year, detailed what transpired at the meeting of the American group on
</p>
<p>Tuesday evening, May 4th, and stated that she, in company with Mr. and
</p>
<p>Mrs. Parsons and Mr. Brown, went to the Haymarket. Subsequently they
</p>
<p>went to Zepf's Hall. She could not say just where Parsons was in the
</p>
<p>saloon when the explosion occurred. She had not heard of the word
</p>
<p>"Ruhe" at the meeting Tuesday evening.
</p>
<p>498 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>On cross-examination she said :
</p>
<p>" My name has been Holmes since November 26th last. Before that
</p>
<p>my name was Swank. All articles in the Alarm under which the initials
</p>
<p>L. M. S. appear are my articles. I wrote an article under date of April
</p>
<p>23d, 1886, headed, 'It is Coming.' I meant it in the same way that any
</p>
<p>prophet means anything, judging from events of past history. I was a
</p>
<p>member of the American group of the Internationale. That night I
</p>
<p>went home with Mrs. Parsons and staid there over night. Mr. Parsons
</p>
<p>did not go home that night. I left him on the corner of Kinzie. I am an
</p>
<p>Anarchist as I understand Anarchy. I have known Spies about three
</p>
<p>years, Fielden about four years. The latter was a stockholder in the paper,
</p>
<p>and I believe complaints were directed to him. I was sometimes absent
</p>
<p>for a whole week from the Arbeiter-Zeitung building. I wrote my articles
</p>
<p>at home and at various places. I don't think I have ever been at the
</p>
<p>Arbeiter-Zeitung building more than six or eight times. I can't remember
</p>
<p>where the Bureau of Information for the Internationale was. I suppose
</p>
<p>it was in the Arbeiter-Zeitung.
</p>
<p>" I never advocated arson, or advised persons to commit arson in my
</p>
<p>life. I wrote the article entitled ' Notice to Tramps,' in the April 24th
</p>
<p>number of the Alarm, which reads :
</p>
<p>" In a beautiful town, not far from Chicago, lives a large class of cultivated, well-informed
</p>
<p>people. They have Shakespeare, Lowell, Longfellow and Whittier at their tongues' ends,
</p>
<p>and are posted in history and grow enthusiastic over the wickedness of the safely abolished
</p>
<p>institutions of the past. They say eloquent things about old fugitive slave laws, etc., which
</p>
<p>made it criminal to feed and shelter a starving human being if he were black. Posted at the
</p>
<p>roadside, in the hotels and stores, is a ' Notice to Tramps,' an abominable document which
</p>
<p>compares well with the old notices to runaway negroes which used to deface similar buildings.
</p>
<p>It is against the law to feed a tramp. You are liable to a fine if you give a cup of coffee and
</p>
<p>a piece of bread to a fellow-man who needs it and asks you for it. This is a Christian- com-
</p>
<p>munity, under the flag of the free. Look out, you wretched slaves. If, after toiling through
</p>
<p>your best years, you are suddenly thrown out of a job along with thousands of others, do not
</p>
<p>start out to hunt for work, for you will strike plenty of such towns as this. You must not
</p>
<p>walk from town to town. You must not stay where you are in idleness you must move on.
</p>
<p>You must not ride you have no money, and those tracks and cars you helped to build are

</p>
<p>not for such as you. You must not ask for anything to eat, or a place to sleep. You must
</p>
<p>not lie down and die, for then you would shock people's morals. What are you to do ?
</p>
<p>Great heavens! Jump into the lake ? Fly up into the air ? Or stay have you a match
</p>
<p>about you ? "
</p>
<p>" I wrote that article deliberately; it speaks for itself. I don't think it
</p>
<p>needs any explanation from me."
</p>
<p>SAMUEL FIELDEN was then put on the witness-stand and testified in his
</p>
<p>own behalf as follows :
</p>
<p>"On May 4th last I took a load of stone to Waldheim Cemetery. I
</p>
<p>had engaged to speak that night at 268 Twelfth Street, and intended to go
</p>
<p>there. When I got home in the evening I bought a copy of the Daily News
</p>
<p>and there saw the announcement of a meeting of the American group to
</p>
<p>be held at 107 Fifth Avenue, that night. I believe it said important busi-
</p>
<p>ness. I was the treasurer of the American group, and as such had all the
</p>
<p>money it was worth. We should have had our semi-annnal election the
</p>
<p>Sunday previous ; besides, I thought that some money would be wanted,
</p>
<p>as important business was announced, so I determined to go to that meet-
</p>
<p>ing instead of to the meeting at which I had engaged to speak. I arrived
</p>
<p>at 107 Fifth Avenue about ten minutes before eight. I was there when
</p>
<p>FIELDEN ON THE STAND. 499
</p>
<p>some telephoning was done with reference to the Deering meeting. The
</p>
<p>witnesses who have detailed that occurrence are substantially correct. After
</p>
<p>I had entered the room I asked what the meeting was called for, and a
</p>
<p>gentleman named Patterson, who was not a member of our organization,
</p>
<p>showed me a hand-bill, which did not call that meeting, but had reference
</p>
<p>to the organization of the sewing women. I paid, as treasurer, five dollars
</p>
<p>to those who had laid out the costs of printing those hand-bills, and who
</p>
<p>might need a little money for car-fare in going around to hire halls, and
</p>
<p>other incidental expenses. Schwab must have left there about ten or
</p>
<p>iifteen minutes past eight. During the progress of the meeting a request
</p>
<p>was received from the Haymarket meeting for speakers, in response to which
</p>
<p>Parsons and I went over. Mr. Parsons, I believe, brought his two children
</p>
<p>down-stairs and gave them a drink of water in the saloon ; then we walked
</p>
<p>together through the tunnel, and from about the west end of the tunnel I
</p>
<p>walked with Mr. Snyder, with whom I had a conversation. Spies spoke
</p>
<p>about five minutes longer after we had arrived there ; then he introduced
</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons. During Parsons' speech I was on the wagon. After he con-
</p>
<p>cluded I was introdcced by Mr. Spies to make a short speech. I did not
</p>
<p>wish to speak, but Mr. Spies urged me, and I did speak about twenty
</p>
<p>minutes. I referred to some adverse criticism of the Socialists by an even-
</p>
<p>ing paper, which had called the Socialists cowards and other uncompli-
</p>
<p>mentary names, and I told the audience that that was not true ; that the
</p>
<p>Socialists were true to the interests of the laboring classes and would continue
</p>
<p>to advocate the rights of labor. I then spoke briefly of the condition
</p>
<p>of labor. I referred to the classes of people who were continually posing
</p>
<p>as labor reformers for their own benefit, and who had never done anything
</p>
<p>to benefit the laboring classes, but had at all times approved the cause of
</p>
<p>labor, in order to get themselves into office. To substantiate this, I cited
</p>
<p>the case of Martin Foran, who, in a speech in Congress on the arbitration
</p>
<p>bill that was brought in by the labor committee, had stated that the working
</p>
<p>classes of this country could get nothing through legislation in Congress,
</p>
<p>and that only when the rich men of this country understood that it was
</p>
<p>dangerous 'to live in a community where there were dissatisfied people
</p>
<p>would the labor problem be solved. Somebody in the audience cried out,

</p>
<p>4 That is not true,' or ' That is a lie. ' Then I went over it again, adding
</p>
<p>words like these : That here was a man who had been on the spot for
</p>
<p>years, had experience, and knew what could be done there, and this was
</p>
<p>his testimony. It was not the testimony of a Socialist. Then I went on to
</p>
<p>state that under such circumstances the only way in which the working
</p>
<p>people could get any satisfaction from the gradually decreasing opportuni-
</p>
<p>ties for their living the only thing they could do with the law would be
</p>
<p>to throttle it. I used that word in a figurative sense. I said they should
</p>
<p>throttle it, because it was an expensive article to them and could do them
</p>
<p>no good. I then stated that men were working all their lifetime, their
</p>
<p>love for their families influencing them to put forth all their efforts, that
</p>
<p>their children might have a better opportunity of starting in the world than
</p>
<p>they had had. And the facts, the statistics of Great Britian and the United
</p>
<p>States, would prove that every year it was becoming utterly impossible for
</p>
<p>the younger generation, under the present system, to have as good an oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity as the former ones had had.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Spies asked me, before I commenced, to mention that the
</p>
<p>Chicago Herald had advised the labor organizations of this city to boycott
</p>
<p>500 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>the red flag. I briefly touched on that, and told them not to boycott the
</p>
<p>red flag, because it was the symbol of universal freedom and universal
</p>
<p>liberty.
</p>
<p>"I was just closing my remarks about that point, when some one said
</p>
<p>it was going to rain. There was a dark, heavy cloud which seemed to be
</p>
<p>rolling over a little to the northwest of me. I looked at it, and some one
</p>
<p>proposed to adjourn the meeting to Zepf's Hall. Somebody else said :
</p>
<p>'No, there is a meeting there,' and I said : 'Never mind ; I will not talk
</p>
<p>very long; I will close in a few minutes, and then we will all go home/
</p>
<p>Then I advised them to organize as laboring men for their own protection
</p>
<p>not to trust to any one else, but to organize among themselves and
</p>
<p>depend only upon themselves to advance their condition. I do not think
</p>
<p>I spoke one minute longer when I saw the police. I stopped speaking,
</p>
<p>and Capt. Ward came up to me and raised his hand I do not remember
</p>
<p>whether he had anything in his hand or not and said : ' I command this
</p>
<p>meeting, in the name of the people of the State of Illinois, to peaceably
</p>
<p>disperse.' I was standing up, and I said: 'Why, Captain, this is a
</p>
<p>peaceable meeting,' in a very conciliatory tone of voice, and he very
</p>
<p>angrily and defiantly retorted that he commanded it to disperse, and called,,
</p>
<p>as I understood, upon the police to disperse it. Just as he turned around
</p>
<p>in that angry mood, I said: 'All right, we will go,' and jumped from,
</p>
<p>the wagon, and jumped to the sidewalk. This is my impression, after
</p>
<p>being in jail now for over three months, and I am telling, as near as I can
</p>
<p>remember, every incident of it. Then the explosion came. I think I went
</p>
<p>in a somewhat southeasterly direction from the time that I struck
</p>
<p>the street. It was only a couple of steps to the sidewalk. I
</p>
<p>had just, I think, got onto the sidewalk when the explosion came,,
</p>
<p>and, being in a diagonal position on the street, I saw the flash.
</p>
<p>The people began to rush past me. I was not decided in my own mind
</p>
<p>what it was, but I heard some one say 'dynamite,' and then in my own.
</p>
<p>mind I assented that that was the cause of the explosion, and I rushed and
</p>
<p>was crowded with the crowd. There were some of them falling down, oth-
</p>
<p>ers calling out in agony, and the police were pouring shots into them. We
</p>
<p>tried to get behind some protection but there were so many trying to get

</p>
<p>there that little protection was afforded. I then made a dash for the north-
</p>
<p>east corner of Randolph and Desplaines Streets, turned the corner and
</p>
<p>ran until I got to about Jefferson Street. Seeing there was no pursuit, I
</p>
<p>dropped into a fast walk. I turned on Clinton, intending at that time to go-
</p>
<p>home.
</p>
<p>" Immediately after the explosion of the bomb I had possibly gone
</p>
<p>three or four steps I was struck with a ball. I didn't feel much pain at
</p>
<p>the time, in the excitement, but as I dropped into a walk down on Randolph
</p>
<p>Street I felt the pain, put my finger in the hole of my pants and felt my
</p>
<p>knee was wet. Then I concluded I had been shot. Walking down Clinton
</p>
<p>Street and intending to go home, I began to think about those that had
</p>
<p>been with me. Remembering about Mr. Spies being on the wagon at the
</p>
<p>time the police came up, I thought surely that some one of these men must
</p>
<p>have been killed from all of that shooting. I concluded to take a Van
</p>
<p>Buren Street car and ride down past the Arbeiter-Zeitung building and see
</p>
<p>if any one was there. I caught the car on the corner of Canal, but found
</p>
<p>that it was a car that runs directly east to State Street. I left the car on
</p>
<p>Fifth Avenue and walked down Fifth Avenue to Monroe Street. Of course,
</p>
<p>FIELDEN ON THE STAND. 501
</p>
<p>I was near the place and could have walked there, but I thought I was so
</p>
<p>well known in Newspaper Row by the reporters that if I should walk I
</p>
<p>should be known. So I jumped on the car and stood in front of it. I
</p>
<p>intended to go up to the Arbeiter-Zeitung building if I saw a light there ;
</p>
<p>but there wasn't any. I alighted near the corner of Randolph Street. In-
</p>
<p>tending to go up to Parsons' house, I took an Indiana Street car. When
</p>
<p>we got to Clinton Street the driver said : ' Why, there is firing going on up
</p>
<p>there yet,' and I saw a couple of flashes up near where I thought the Hay-
</p>
<p>market was, and I said, 'If there is, I am not going up there.' I then
</p>
<p>walked over on Jefferson Street north to Lake Street, and I saw a terrible
</p>
<p>crowd of people around there, and thought there might be a good many
</p>
<p>detectives there. So I turned back again, caught a Canalport Avenue car
</p>
<p>and rode down to the corner of Canal and Twelfth Streets. There I got
</p>
<p>my knee dressed by a young doctor who was on the stand here, as it
</p>
<p>was becoming very painful at that time.
</p>
<p>"I feel sure that Mr. Spies was at my side when Capt. Ward was talk-
</p>
<p>ing. I did not see him after I had spoken to Capt. Ward ; I did not see
</p>
<p>him leave the wagon. I jumped off at the south end of the wagon into the
</p>
<p>street. While I was speaking I did not pay any attention to the people in
</p>
<p>the wagon, but I think I noticed four or five there a little previous to the
</p>
<p>police coming up. Mr. Snyder assisted me in getting on the wagon. He
</p>
<p>got on before I did. When I got down from the wagon Snyder was on the
</p>
<p>ground. I think I saw him on the sidewalk there. Of course I don't
</p>
<p>remember everything as distinctly now as I did the next day. I had no
</p>
<p>revolver with me on the night of May 4th. I never had a revolver in my
</p>
<p>life. I did not fire at any person at the Haymarket meeting. I never fired
</p>
<p>at any person in my life. I did not, after leaving the wagon, step back
</p>
<p>between the wheels of the wagon and fire behind the cover of the wagon ;
</p>
<p>I did not stay there. My whole course was from the wagon south, without
</p>
<p>stopping, except, perhaps, for the smallest perceptible space of time, when
</p>
<p>I was startled by the explosion.
</p>
<p>" I first heard of the word ' Ruhe ' having been published in the Arbeit cr-
</p>
<p>Zeitttng, and about any significance of that word, when I had been in the
</p>
<p>County Jail for some days. I never had seen or heard of the word before,

</p>
<p>and did not hear of it on May 4th at any time, and, as I understand it is a
</p>
<p>German word, I would not have known what it meant if I had seen it. I do
</p>
<p>not read German. There was no understanding or agreement to which I
</p>
<p>was a party, or of which I had knowledge, that violence should be used at
</p>
<p>the Haymarket meeting, or that arms or dynamite should be used there.
</p>
<p>I anticipated no trouble of that character. I did not use, upon the approach
</p>
<p>of the police, and did not hear from any person that night any such expres-
</p>
<p>sion as: 'There come the bloodhounds; you do your duty and I'll do
</p>
<p>mine.'
</p>
<p>"The first I heard of the Haymarket meeting was after I got to the
</p>
<p>American group meeting on the night of May 4th. I heard, for the first
</p>
<p>time, about a meeting held by certain persons on Monday night at 54
</p>
<p>Lake Street, after I had been from ten to fourteen days in the County Jail,
</p>
<p>when I read a paper that the police had got track of some such a meeting.
</p>
<p>I wish to say, however, that I spoke to the wagon-makers on the upper floor
</p>
<p>of 54 Lake Street on that Monday night. I was never in the basement of
</p>
<p>that building, except to the water-closet under the sidewalk. I did not go
</p>
<p>down-stairs there at all on that Monday night, and did not hear of any
</p>
<p>502 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>meeting being held there until much later, when I read about it, as stated
</p>
<p>before.
</p>
<p>"We drilled not over six times at 54 Lake Street, but nobody ever had
</p>
<p>arms there. I think it was proposed to call the organization the Inter-
</p>
<p>national Rifles, but I don't think it was ever decided to call it so, as the
</p>
<p>organization was never perfected, never became an armed organization.
</p>
<p>We began to meet in August, and the last meetings must have been very
</p>
<p>near the end of September, 1885. There was no drilling during the winter
</p>
<p>and spring of i885-'86. Once a few men belonging to the L. u. W. V. came
</p>
<p>in with their guns and shouldered arms, but they did not belong to the
</p>
<p>American group, and that is the only time that I ever saw any arms at any
</p>
<p>meeting of our organization.
</p>
<p>"The shots that were pouring in thick and fast after the explosion of
</p>
<p>the bomb came from the street I should judge from the police. I did
</p>
<p>not hear the explosion of anything before the explosion of the bomb. As I
</p>
<p>was rushing down the sidewalk, I heard no explosion of any arms among
</p>
<p>any of the citizens who had attended the meeting.
</p>
<p>"I remember the testimony of the detective Johnson. I did not have
</p>
<p>the conversation which he testified to as having had with me in the pres-
</p>
<p>ence of the older Mr. Boyd at Twelfth Street Turner Hall, nor at any other
</p>
<p>place, nor at any other time. I knew that he was a detective long before
</p>
<p>that, and I would not be fool enough to advocate anything of that kind, if
</p>
<p>I was a dynamiter, to him. The American group was open to everybody.
</p>
<p>It was not even necessary to have ten cents admission fee, but the fee was
</p>
<p>set at ten cents per month to cover the expense of paying for hall rent and
</p>
<p>advertising. On May 4th I returned home from my work about half past
</p>
<p>five. I bought the Evening News on the sidewalk just before I went into
</p>
<p>the house.
</p>
<p>"On May 3d I took several loads of stone from Bodenschatz & Earn-

<p>shaw's stone dock, Harrison Street and the river, to different places in the
</p>
<p>city. I have worked for that firm three or four years. I owned my team
</p>
<p>and wagon, and they hired those and my services, and paid me by the day.
</p>
<p>I only worked three-quarters of a day on May 3d. Business was not brisk
</p>
<p>at that time. I have been a teamster for at least six years. I was arrested

<p>at my home at ten o'clock on the morning of May 5th. I was never before
</p>
<p>arrested in my life. I was taken to the Central Station by four or five
</p>
<p>detectives in citizens' clothes, and have been confined ever since.
</p>
<p>" I had no examination except that I was brought before the Coroner's
</p>
<p>jury on the evening of May 5th. I did not state to Officer James Bonfield
</p>
<p>or anybody else, after my arrest at the station, or at any other time or
</p>
<p>place, that I escaped through Crane's alley on the night of May 4th."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination Fielden said :
</p>
<p>"I worked in a cotton-mill in England at eight years of age, and con-
</p>
<p>tinued to work in the same mill until I came to the United States. I
</p>
<p>worked my way up until I became a weaver, and when I left the mill I was
</p>
<p>what is called a binder ; that is, binding the warps on the beams. I joined
</p>
<p>the International Working People's Association in July, 1884, by joining
</p>
<p>the American group. I suppose I was an Anarchist soon after, as soon as
</p>
<p>I began to study it. I suppose that I have been a revolutionist, in the
</p>
<p>sense of evolutionary revolution, for some years. I don't know that I
</p>
<p>have ever been positively of the belief that the existing order of things
</p>
<p>FIELD EN'S CROSS-EXAMINATION. 503
</p>
<p>should be overthrown by force. I have always been of the belief, and am
</p>
<p>yet, that the existing order of things will have to be overthrown, either
</p>
<p>peaceably or by force. When I had the books of the American group it
</p>
<p>had about 175 members that was last November. I don't know how
</p>
<p>many have been added since. There were probably fifteen or twenty
</p>
<p>ladies among the members. It was called the American group because
</p>
<p>the English language was used in it. It was not confined to born
</p>
<p>Americans.
</p>
<p>" We tried to found an English-speaking group a year ago last winter,
</p>
<p>on West Indiana Street. I think we had only two meetings and then
</p>
<p>abandoned it. I have been making speeches for the last two or three years.
</p>
<p>They were labor speeches not always Socialistic and not always An-
</p>
<p>archistic ; that is, sometimes I have touched on Socialism and Anarchy ;
</p>
<p>sometimes they were delivered from an ordinary trades-union standpoint.
</p>
<p>I have made a great many speeches on the lake front, some on Market
</p>
<p>Square, some at West Twelfth Street Turner Hall, some at 106 Randolph
</p>
<p>Street, some at 54 West Lake. The meetings on the lake front were on
</p>
<p>Sunday afternoons."
</p>
<p>" Did you make a speech on the night of the opening of the new Board
</p>
<p>of Trade?"
</p>
<p>" I did. I have two dollars' worth of stock in the Alarm. I was part of
</p>
<p>the committee to see what should be done about the Alarm when it began
</p>
<p>to get in deep water, and my name was proposed to be put on the paper as
</p>
<p>the recipient of communications as to its management.
</p>
<p>"There were possibly twelve or fifteen members of the American group
</p>
<p>present at the meeting at 107 Fifth Avenue on May 4th. There were Mr.
</p>
<p>and Mrs. Parsons, Mr. and Mrs. Timmons, Mrs. Holmes, Snyder, Brown
</p>
<p>and some others. I am not positive whether Walters and Ducy were there.
</p>
<p>I think we staid there until nearly nine o'clock. Balthasar Rau came over
</p>
<p>from the Haymarket and said Spies was there and a large meeting, and no
</p>
<p>one else to speak. Some four or five of us went over together. I know that
</p>
<p>Rau, Parsons, myself and Snyder went about together. Schwab left the
</p>
<p>Zeitung office before us. I had promised, on Sunday night at Greif's Hall,
</p>
<p>a man who had been to my house before, to speak at a labor meeting at

</p>
<p>either 368 or 378 West Twelfth Street that Tuesday night. Of those that
</p>
<p>were on the speakers' wagon, I only remember Parsons, Spies and Snyder.
</p>
<p>There were some others there who were strangers to me. A boy about six-
</p>
<p>teen years of age came up on the wagon and rather crowded me to one side,
</p>
<p>and I told him he might as well stand down. I spoke because Mr. Spies
</p>
<p>requested me to make a short speech. Mr. Parsons had spoken longer than
</p>
<p>I thought he would, and I thought it was late enough to close. I don't now
</p>
<p>remember whether or not I used this language : ' There are premonitions of
</p>
<p>danger. All know it. The press say the Anarchists will sneak away. We
</p>
<p>are not going to. ' I have no desire to deny that I did use that language.
</p>
<p>If I used it and I don't know whether I did if I had any idea in my
</p>
<p>mind at any time which would be expressed in that language, I know for
</p>
<p>what reasons I would have that idea. I used substantially all that language
</p>
<p>which Mr. English, the reporter, who was on the stand here, testified as
</p>
<p>having been used by me in my speech at the Haymarket meeting. I did
</p>
<p>not say that John Brown, Jefferson, Washington, Patrick Henry and Hop-
</p>
<p>kins said to the people : ' The law is your enemy.' If I used the language,
</p>
<p>'We are rebels against it,' and I possibly did, I referred to the present
</p>
<p>504 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>social system. I don't remember that I said : ' It had no mercy; so ought
</p>
<p>you.' There is not much sense in it, and I will not father it. The report
</p>
<p>of my speech, as given by Mr. English, has been garbled, and it does not
</p>
<p>give the connection. I don't accept that as my speech at all. I think I
</p>
<p>used the language, but you haven't got the sense of it at all, in quoting it in
</p>
<p>that way.
</p>
<p>" After I left the Haymarket meeting, my first intention was to go home.
</p>
<p>I cannot tell now why I changed my mind about that. Impressions some-
</p>
<p>times come on a person's mind which he cannot explain why they come
</p>
<p>there. I rode on the car in passing the Arbeiter-Zeitung office, instead of
</p>
<p>walking, and I avoided the crowd on Lake Street, in which I thought there
</p>
<p>would be lots of detectives, because I certainly didn't wish to be arrested
</p>
<p>that night. Of course, I thought I would be arrested after the trouble ;
</p>
<p>it was only natural to suppose I would. I did not think there was anything
</p>
<p>inflammatory or incendiary in my speech. I did not incite anybody to do
</p>
<p>any overt act to anybody or anything. I spoke generally, from a general
</p>
<p>standpoint. I meant to say they should resist the present social system,
</p>
<p>which degraded them and turned them out of employment, and gave them
</p>
<p>no opportunity to get a living. Somebody threw a bomb. I did not know
</p>
<p>and do not know now who it was, or anything about it. Still I know, from
</p>
<p>reading of criminal proceedings, that in cases of that kind they arrest every-
</p>
<p>body in order to find out who is responsible. I supposed that I, being one
</p>
<p>of the participants of the meeting, would be arrested for some time, at least.
</p>
<p>Knowing my innocence, I made a statement before the Coroner's jury, ex-
</p>
<p>pecting that when they examined into the truth of my statement I should
</p>
<p>be released."
</p>
<p>On re-direct examination Fielden said :
</p>
<p>"If I did make the remark about premonitions of danger in my Hay-
</p>
<p>market speech, I must have meant that there were so many men striking
</p>
<p>just then for the eight-hour movement that some trouble might possibly
</p>
<p>originate between the strikers and their employers, as had been the case in
</p>
<p>former strikes, and, knowing that all men are not very cool, and some men
</p>
<p>become aggravated their condition may have a good deal to do with it
</p>
<p>they sometimes commit acts which the officers of the law, in their capacity
</p>

</p>
<p>as such, are compelled to interfere with. I was speaking of the general
</p>
<p>labor question and the issue that was up for settlement during the eight-
</p>
<p>hour movement. I had no reference to the presence of dynamite at the
</p>
<p>meeting. I did not say that John Brown, Jefferson, etc., said that the law
</p>
<p>was their enemy. What I said in regard to them was, that we occupied, in
</p>
<p>relation to the present social system, which no longer provided security for
</p>
<p>the masses, just about the position that John Brown, Jefferson, Hopkins,
</p>
<p>Patrick Henry occupied in relation to the government and dictation of
</p>
<p>Great Britain over the Colonies ; that they repeatedly appealed to Great
</p>
<p>Britain to peaceably settle the differences in regard to the port duties, the
</p>
<p>stamp act, etc., but when it could not be peaceably settled, they could not
</p>
<p>submit to it any longer, and were compelled to do something else ; and it
</p>
<p>was always the element of tyranny which incited strife, and as it was in that
</p>
<p>case, so it would be in this. As to the use of the expressions about killing,
</p>
<p>stabbing, throttling the law, I used them just as a Republican orator, in
</p>
<p>denouncing the Democratic party, might say, 'We will kill it,' or 'We will
</p>
<p>throttle it,' or 'defeat it,' or as one might speak of a candidate for office
</p>
<p>FIELDEN'S EXPLANA TION. 505
</p>
<p>'We will knife him.' I used those adjectives, as any speaker would, in
</p>
<p>rushing along, throw in adjectives without thinking much of what their full
</p>
<p>import might be. My remarks that night were intended to call upon the
</p>
<p>people to resist the present social system not by force, I had no such idea
</p>
<p>in my mind that night so that they would be enabled to live ; to call their
</p>
<p>attention to the fact that by the introduction of labor-saving machinery and
</p>
<p>the subdivision of labor less men were continually needed, more produc-
</p>
<p>tions produced, and their chance to work decreased, and that by their
</p>
<p>organizing together they might become partakers in the benefits of civiliza-
</p>
<p>tion, more advantageous and quicker productions."
</p>
<p>Together with the testimony given above, of which, of course, the most
</p>
<p>important was that of the prisoner Samuel Fielden, were the stories of a
</p>
<p>number of other witnesses whose names have been here omitted. The rea-
</p>
<p>son for this is, that while the statements of these persons were of much
</p>
<p>importance in the trial of the case, to print them all would stretch this
</p>
<p>book of mine out to unconscionable length. It will suffice to say that sev-
</p>
<p>eral witnesses testified strongly in support of the Anarchist theory of the
</p>
<p>episodes which occurred about the famous wagon at the Haymarket. Half
</p>
<p>a dozen others declared that they would not believe Harry W. Gilmer on
</p>
<p>oath. This statement of the evidence offered is made necessary by the
</p>
<p>space at my disposal. I have tried throughout this work to be wholly fair
</p>
<p>to the defense, and the reader will of course understand that these witnesses
</p>
<p>corroborated the testimony of others which has been previously given in

</p>
<p>THROUGHOUT the trial the defendants maintained an air of careless
</p>
<p>indifference. Occasionally during the presentation of particularly strik-
</p>
<p>ing and damaging evidence notably that of Thompson and Gilmer
</p>
<p>the)' were noticed to wince, but the flush was only momentary. It was
</p>
<p>apparent that the prisoners expected in some manner to extricate them-
</p>
<p>selves from their perilous position, and the casual observer would have
</p>
<p>supposed them involved simply in an ordinary trial. Whatever may have
</p>
<p>been their real feelings, they did not betray them. After they had begun to
</p>
<p>place evidence on their own behalf before the jury, they even wore a
</p>
<p>certain air of cheerfulness ; and whereas previously a sort of stolidity had
</p>
<p>marked their demeanor, their general bearing now was that of supreme con-
</p>
<p>fidence. They evidently felt confident of having made a favorable im-
</p>
<p>pression upon the jury. They possibly calculated upon their having
</p>
<p>successfully impeached the evidence of Gilmer and having proven to some
</p>
<p>extent their own disconnection with the Haymarket explosion. Fielden's
</p>
<p>plausible explanations also, no doubt, added to their confidence.
</p>
<p>Taking the evidence of the State as a complete exposition of the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, there seemed to be no consolation in that direction ; but their hope
</p>
<p>rested in winning over the jury by raising a reasonable doubt through the
</p>
<p>preponderance of offsetting testimony on their own side, and by making the
</p>
<p>jury believe, by the manner of their conduct under the severe fire of the
</p>
<p>prosecution, that they sincerely felt themselves innocent of all "guilty
</p>
<p>knowledge."
</p>
<p>They played their part well, and their attitude is not at all surprising
</p>
<p>when their former bloodthirsty propensities are taken into consideration.
</p>
<p>In an ordinary murder or conspiracy trial Fielden's statements might have
</p>
<p>had some influence in mitigation of extreme punishment, but, over-
</p>

</p>
<p>shadowed as it was by overwhelming counter-evidence of complicity in a
</p>
<p>stupendous crime, the jury subsequently determined that it saw no way of
</p>
<p>disconnecting him from the other conspirators.
</p>
<p>The defendants pretended they had a host of witnesses beyond those that
</p>
<p>they really required to prove that they had never dreamed there would be
</p>
<p>a bomb thrown at the Haymarket, but that they only needed to use a few
</p>
<p>JOHN BERNETTS TESTIMONY. 507
</p>
<p>of these witnesses to establish their innocence. Still, they put a very large
</p>
<p>number on the stand. The testimony of all these pretended to show what
</p>
<p>a harmless set of men the State had arrested and put on trial for their
</p>
<p>lives.
</p>
<p>The trend of much of the evidence for the defense seemed directed
</p>
<p>toward proving the police responsible for the massacre, by having opened
</p>
<p>fire on a " peaceable gathering ; " and, through a brother of the defendant
</p>
<p>Spies, it was attempted to prove that the enmity of the police toward
</p>
<p>Anarchists was so great that one of them tried to shoot the defendant in
</p>
<p>the back while at the Haymarket. This brother of Spies Henry had
</p>
<p>been wounded in the abdomen, and he endeavored, on the witness-stand,
</p>
<p>to show that he had received the injury while suddenly pressing down the
</p>
<p>revolver that was aimed at his brother. The explanation was too lame to
</p>
<p>be serviceable.
</p>
<p>At this point several witnesses testified to Lingg's presence at Zepf's
</p>
<p>Hall early on the night of May 3d. Others strengthened the Anarchistic
</p>
<p>theory of an alleged police attack at the Haymarket. Still others im-
</p>
<p>peached the witness Gilmer's veracity. Inasmuch as I have previously
</p>
<p>given in full all the evidence which these people merely corroborated, I
</p>
<p>have not thought it necessary to give here their statements at length.
</p>
<p>JOHN BERNETT, a candy-maker, said he saw the man who threw the
</p>
<p>bomb. The thrower was right in front of him. The bomb " went west and
</p>
<p>a little bit north."
</p>
<p>"The man who threw it was about my size, maybe a little bit bigger,
</p>
<p>and I think he had a mustache. I think he had no chin beard, and his
</p>
<p>clothes were dark."
</p>
<p>" Did you ever see that picture before? " (handing witness photograph
</p>
<p>of Schnaubelt).
</p>
<p>" Yes, sir ; Mr. Furthmann showed it to me about two weeks ago."
</p>
<p>" Do you recognize that as being the man who threw the bomd ? "
</p>
<p>" I guess not."
</p>
<p>" Did you tell Mr. Furthmann so at the time ?"
</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination Bernett said :

</p>
<p>" I never could recognize anybody. I told Capt. Schaack and Mr.
</p>
<p>Grinnell that the man who threw the bomb was in front of me, and I could
</p>
<p>not tell how he did look. When the police came up first I stood right in
</p>
<p>the middle of the alley. When the captain of the police ordered them to
</p>
<p>leave that place, I heard somebody say : ' Stand ; don't run,' and there were
</p>
<p>about three or four men, about the middle of the street, west of the wagon,
</p>
<p>who halloaed out : ' No ; we won't do it.' That was said in English. I
</p>
<p>heard Fielden say something to the officer who spoke to him, but I could
</p>
<p>not hear it. The crowd began to rush, and rushed me, and I hurried out
</p>
<p>as fast as I could. I got shot and fell on the sidewalk. I told Mr. Furth-
</p>
<p>mann that I thought the bomb was fired from about fifteen steps south of
</p>
<p>the alley I count my steps about two feet and a half. I don't think it
</p>

</p>
<p>came right from behind the boxes. From the place the bomb was thrown
</p>
<p>up to the other corner the house goes up a little further on the other side
</p>
<p>the distance is forty-five feet. The bomb was thrown forty-five feet south
</p>
<p>of the corner of the alley. I cannot remember how far the boxes were south
</p>
<p>of the alley that night there was a lamp-post, and then the boxes came.
</p>
<p>I remember coming to the Central Station on the yth of May and talking
</p>
<p>to Officer Bonfield in the presence of Mr. Grinnell. I don't know that I
</p>
<p>said at that time that the bomb was thrown from behind the boxes, but I
</p>
<p>think I am right now. I don't think I stated afterwards, some weeks ago,
</p>
<p>that it was thrown some twenty or twenty-five feet south of the alley. I
</p>
<p>can't remember now how many feet I stated the distance was, but I think I
</p>
<p>have got it right now. On the yth of May I was brought over here by
</p>
<p>Officer Bonfield and Officer Haas, so that I could see the defendants. I was
</p>
<p>asked if I had ever seen them before, and I said I had seen them all before
</p>
<p>on the lake front and the Haymarket. I told Capt. Schaack that I could
</p>
<p>not describe the man and would not know him if I saw him, and that the
</p>
<p>man's back was toward me."
</p>
<p>MICHAEL SCHWAB was then called in his own behalf, and he made the
</p>
<p>following statement :
</p>
<p>" Up to the 4th of May I lived at 51 Florimond Street. I was co-editor
</p>
<p>of the Arbeiter-Zeitung. On the evening of May 4th I left home twenty
</p>
<p>minutes to eight, went to the Arbeiter-Zeitung and reached there about eight
</p>
<p>o'clock. I left about ten minutes later. While I was there a telephone
</p>
<p>message was received asking Mr. Spies to speak at Deering. After that I
</p>
<p>went over to the Haymarket to see whether I could find Mr. Spies. I didn't
</p>
<p>stop long over there. I just went through the crowd, as the men out at Deer-
</p>
<p>ing had been waiting for an hour already. I went over on Washington Street,
</p>
<p>turned north down Desplaines Street and went across Randolph Street, and
</p>
<p>north of Randolph on Desplaines I met my brother-in-law, Rudolph Schnau-
</p>
<p>belt, and talked to him about the matter ; then took a car going in an east-
</p>
<p>erly direction and rode up to the Court-house. At the Court-house I took
</p>
<p>a Clybourn Avenue car and went to Deering's factory. Near the car stables
</p>
<p>I was met by a man and asked whether I was Mr. Schwab. The man testi-
</p>
<p>fied here on the witness-stand. I think his name is Preusser, as he told me

</p>
<p>that night. I should judge it takes about ten minutes from the Haymarket
</p>
<p>to the Court-house and about forty or forty-five minutes from there to
</p>
<p>Fullerton Avenue. I stepped from the car with that man ; went up to the
</p>
<p>saloon, 888 Clybourn Avenue, to see the committee, but the committee was
</p>
<p>not there ; so we went directly to the prairie, corner of Fullerton and Cly-
</p>
<p>bourn Avenues, and there I met some men who told me that they were the
</p>
<p>committee. I talked with them some minutes, then mounted the stand and
</p>
<p>made a speech, twenty or twenty-five minutes long, about the eight-hour
</p>
<p>movement, to the men who had struck that same day and demanded eight
</p>
<p>hours' work and ten hours' pay. I returned home about eleven o'clock at
</p>
<p>night. I didn't pay any attention to the time. After the meeting was over
</p>
<p>I went with Preusser to a saloon, took a glass of beer and had some lunch,
</p>
<p>and then I took the next car going south. I left the car on Willow Street,
</p>
<p>which is not far north from North Avenue, and walked home, which is a
</p>
<p>distance of about twenty minutes' walk.
</p>
<p>" I did not at any time while I was at the Haymarket enter Crane's alley
</p>
<p>or any alley with Mr. Spies. I had no conversation with him near the
</p>
<p>SCHWAB ON THE STAND. 509
</p>
<p>mouth of the alley. I did not walk at any time that night in company with
</p>
<p>Mr. Spies on the north side of Randolph Street from the corner of Desplaines
</p>
<p>down past Union Street and return to where the wagon stood. I did not,
</p>
<p>in company with Mr. Spies, meet Schnaubelt when Spies handed to
</p>
<p>Schnaubelt any package or anything. I did not see Spies and did not speak
</p>
<p>to him at all that night at the Haymarket. I did not say anything to Spies
</p>
<p>or anybody else in the mouth of Crane's alley about pistols or police, or
</p>
<p>whether one would be enough. Lhad no such conversation with anybody
</p>
<p>at the Haymarket or anywhere. I did not say to Mr. Spies or anybody else
</p>
<p>at any time before the meeting began or at any other time that if the police
</p>
<p>came we were ready for them or we would give it to them, or any words to
</p>
<p>thai? effect.
</p>
<p>" When I left the Haymarket the meeting had not begun ; men were
</p>
<p>standing around on all four corners. I had seen Mr. Spies last that day in
</p>
<p>the afternoon. I did not see him again until the next day in the morning,
</p>
<p>when I came to the office."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination Schwab said :
</p>
<p>" I was a member of the North Side group of the International Working-
</p>
<p>men's Association from the time it started, some years ago, until up to the
</p>
<p>4th of May last. I walked over to the Haymarket from the Arbeiter-Zeitung
</p>
<p>that night through the Washington Street tunnel with Balthasar Rau. He
</p>
<p>left me on Desplaines and Randolph ; there 1 lost him. Then I crossed
</p>
<p>Randolph Street, and about the middle of Randolph Street met Mr. Heine-
</p>
<p>man. I inquired of some persons whom I knew by sight whether they had
</p>
<p>seen Spies. I staid there not more than five minutes, then took a car and
</p>
<p>went east. I went alone. I should judge it was about half-past eight when
</p>
<p>I took the car on Randolph Street and about twenty minutes of nine when I
</p>
<p>took the Clybourn Avenue car and went north. I was alone on that way. I
</p>
<p>don't know what time it was when I got to the saloon at 888 Clybourn
</p>
<p>Avenue. From there it is about a block or a little more to the prairie where
</p>
<p>the meeting was held. When I got there I spoke first to some of the mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the committee to find out what they wanted me to speak about. That
</p>
<p>took about five minutes. After I had spoken to the meeting I went with
</p>
<p>Preusser to a saloon, corner of Clybourn and Ashland Avenues, not the

<p>same saloon I went into the first time. I did not see Balthasar Rau again
</p>
<p>that night."
</p>
<p>"Are you an Anarchist? "
</p>
<p>" That depends upon what you mean by that. There are several divis-
</p>
<p>ions of the Anarchists."

<p>" Are you an Anarchist ? "
</p>
<p>"Well, I can't answer that."
</p>
<p>AUGUST VINCENT THEODORE SPIES was next put on the stand to testify
</p>
<p>in his own behalf. He said :
</p>
<p>" May 4th last I was one of the editors of the Arbeiter-Zeitung. I occu-
</p>
<p>pied that position since 1880. Prior to that I was engaged in this country
</p>
<p>principally in the furniture business. I am a member of the Socialistic
</p>
<p>Publishing Society, which is organized under the laws of the State of Illinois,
</p>
<p>and by which the Arbeiter-Zeitung was published. I was an employe of that
</p>
<p>society in my position as editor, and as such was subject to their control as
</p>
<p>to the general policy of the paper.
</p>
<p>5io ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>" At a meeting of the Central Labor Union in the evening of Sunday,
</p>
<p>May 2, at 54 West Lake Street, which I attended in the capacity of a re-
</p>
<p>porter, I was invited by one or two delegates to address a meeting of the
</p>
<p>Lumber-shovers' Union on the afternoon of May 3, on the corner of Twenty-
</p>
<p>second or Twentieth and Blue Island Avenue. As there were no other
</p>
<p>speakers, I went out. When I came there was a crowd of 6,000 to 7,000
</p>
<p>people assembled on the prairie. When I was invited, which was the first
</p>
<p>information I received of the meeting, nothing was said to me about any
</p>
<p>relationship of Mr. McCormick's employes to that meeting. I did not know
</p>
<p>that the locality of the meeting was in the immediate neighborhood of Mc-
</p>
<p>Cormick's. I arrived there, as near as I can judge, a little after three
</p>
<p>o'clock. Several men were speaking from a car in the Bohemian or Polish
</p>
<p>language ; they were very poor speakers, and small crowds of those
</p>
<p>assembled detached themselves to the side and talked together. Balthasar
</p>
<p>Rau introduced me to the chairman of the meeting. I don't remember his
</p>
<p>name ; he testified here. I asked him if I was to speak there, and he said yes.
</p>
<p>I waited for about ten minutes while reports came in from the different
</p>
<p>owners of the lumber-yards as to the demand made by the union, which
</p>
<p>was eight hours' work at twenty-two cents per hour. They then elected a
</p>
<p>committee to wait upon the bosses to find out what concessions they would
</p>
<p>make, if any. Thereupon I was introduced to address the meeting, and
</p>
<p>spoke from fifteen to twenty minutes. Having spoken two or three times
</p>
<p>almost every day for the preceding two or three weeks, I was almost pros-
</p>
<p>trated, and spoke very calmly, and told the people, who in my judgment were
</p>
<p>not of a very high intellectual grade, to stand together and to enforce their
</p>
<p>demands at all hazards ; otherwise the single bosses would one by one defeat
</p>
<p>them. While I was speaking I heard somebody in the rear, probably a hun-
</p>
<p>dred feet away from me, cry out something in a language which I didn't under-
</p>
<p>stand perhaps Bohemian or Polish. After the meeting I was told that
</p>
<p>this man had called upon them to follow him up to McCormick's. I should
</p>
<p>judge about two hundred persons, standing a little ways apart from the main
</p>
<p>body, detached themselves and went away. I didn't know where they were
</p>
<p>going until probably five minutes later I heard firing, and about that time I
</p>
<p>stopped speaking and inquired where the pistol shots came from, and was

</p>
<p>told that some men had gone up there to stone McCormick's 'scabs' and that
</p>
<p>the police had fired upon them. I stopped there probably another five or
</p>
<p>six minutes, during which time I was elected a member of the committee
</p>
<p>to visit the bosses, when two patrol wagons came up in great haste on the
</p>
<p>Black Road, so-called, driving towards McCormick's, followed immediately
</p>
<p>by about seventy-five policemen on foot, and then other patrol wagons
</p>
<p>came. I jumped from the car and went up to McCormick's. They were
</p>
<p>shooting all the while. I thought it must be quite a battle. In front of
</p>
<p>McCormick's factory there are some railroad tracks, on which a number of
</p>
<p>freight-cars were standing. The people were running away and hiding
</p>
<p>behind these freight-cars as much as they could, to keep out of the way of
</p>
<p>the pistol-firing. The fight was going on behind the cars. When I came
</p>
<p>up there on this prairie, right in front of McCormick's, I saw a policeman
</p>
<p>run after and fire at people who were fleeing, running away. My blood
</p>
<p>was boiling, and, seeing unarmed men, women and children, who were run-
</p>
<p>ning away, fired upon. I think in that moment I could have done almost
</p>
<p>anything. At that moment a young Irishman, who probably knew me or
</p>
<p>had seen me at the meeting, came running from behind the cars ?nd said :

<p>SPIES ADDRESSING THE STRIKERS AT MCCORMICK'S.
</p>
<p>512 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>'What kind of a business is this? What h 1 of a union is that ?
</p>
<p>What people are tfyese who will let those men be shot down here like dogs ?
</p>
<p>I just come from there ; we have carried away two men dead, and there are
</p>
<p>a number of others lying on the ground who will most likely die. At least
</p>
<p>twenty or twenty-five must have been shot who ran away or were carried
</p>
<p>away by friends. ' Of course I could not do anything there. I went back
</p>
<p>to where the meeting had been, which was about three blocks away. I
</p>
<p>told some of them what was going on at McCormick's, but they were un-
</p>
<p>concerned and went home. I took a car and went down town. The same
</p>
<p>evening I wrote the report of the meeting which appeared in the Arbeiter-
</p>
<p>Zeitung of the next day. Immediately after I came to the office I wrote the
</p>
<p>so-called Revenge circular, except the heading, 'Revenge.' At the time I
</p>
<p>wrote it I believed the statement that six workingmen had been killed that
</p>
<p>afternoon at McCormick's. I wrote at first that two had .been killed, and
</p>
<p>after seeing the report in the five o'clock News I changed the two to six,
</p>
<p>based upon the information contained in the News. I believe 2,500 copies
</p>
<p>of that circular were printed, but not more than half of them distributed,
</p>
<p>for I saw quite a lot of them in the office of the Arbeiter-Zeitung on the
</p>
<p>morning I was arrested. At the time I wrote it I was still laboring under
</p>
<p>the excitement of the scene and the hour. I was very indignant.
</p>
<p>" On May 4th I was performing my regular duties at the Arbeiter-Zeitung.
</p>
<p>A little before nine in the forenoon I was invited to address a meeting on
</p>
<p>the Haymarket that evening. That was the first I heard of it. I had no
</p>
<p>part in calling the meeting. I put the announcement of the meeting into
</p>
<p>the Arbeiter-Zeitung at the request of a man who invited me to speak. The
</p>
<p>Arbeiter-Zeitung^ is an afternoon daily paper, and appears at 2 p. M.
</p>
<p>About eleven o'clock a circular calling the Haymarket meeting was handed
</p>
<p>to me to be inserted in the Arbeiter-Zeitung, containing the line, ' Work-
</p>
<p>ingmen, arm yourselves and appear in full force.' I said to the man who
</p>
<p>brought the circular that, if that was the meeting which I had been invited
</p>
<p>to address, I should certainly not speak there, on account of that line. He
</p>
<p>stated that the circulars had not been distributed, and I told him if that
</p>
<p>was the case, and if he would take out that line, it would be all right. Mr.
</p>
<p>Fischer was called down at that time, and he sent the man back to the

</p>
<p>printing-office to have the line taken out. I struck out the line myself
</p>
<p>before I handed it to the compositor to put it in the Arbeiter-Zeitung. The
</p>
<p>man who brought the circular to me and took it back with the line stricken
</p>
<p>out was on the stand here Grueneberg I believe is his name.
</p>
<p>" I left home that evening about half-past seven o'clock and walked down
</p>
<p>with my brother Henry, arriving at the Haymarket about twenty or twenty-
</p>
<p>five minutes after eight. I had understood from the invitation that I should
</p>
<p>address the meeting in German ; and, knowing that the English speeches
</p>
<p>would come first, I did not go there in time to reach the opening of the
</p>
<p>meeting. When I got there, there was no meeting in progress, however ;
</p>
<p>simply crowds were standing around the corners here and there, talking
</p>
<p>together. I called them together. After having looked around for a speak-
</p>
<p>ers' stand we generally had very primitive platforms I saw this wagon
</p>
<p>on Desplaines Street ; and being right near the corner, I thought it was a
</p>
<p>good place to choose and told the people that the meeting would take place
</p>
<p>there. There was no light upon the wagon. Early in the meeting I think
</p>
<p>the sky was bright. I cannot tell whether the lamp at the alley was burn-
</p>
<p>ing or not ; my impression is that it was. I could not say about any other
</p>
<p>SPIES ON THE STAND. 513
</p>
<p>light. I found the wagon just where we used it. It was not an ordinary
</p>
<p>truck wagon ; it was a half truck and half express wagon, the truck with the
</p>
<p>box on. I don't know that there were any stakes on it ; it was a large, long
</p>
<p>express wagon. I believe I spoke with my brother Henry as to the advisa-
</p>
<p>bility of choosing that place. Henry was with me during the entire evening.
</p>
<p>After the audience got together, somebody suggested to draw the wagon
</p>
<p>into the Haymarket. I replied that that might interfere with the street
</p>
<p>traffic, and that the cars would make a good deal of noise. Then I asked if
</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons was present. I thought he had been invited to address the
</p>
<p>meeting. I was not on the arrangement committee ; but seeing the crowd
</p>
<p>and seeing that the meeting had been very poorly arranged, I took the
</p>
<p>initiative. When I asked for Parsons, one of the editors of the Arbeiter-
</p>
<p>Zeitung, one Schroeder, stepped up and said : ' Parsons is speaking up on
</p>
<p>the corner of Halsted and Randolph Streets ; I just saw him there.' I told
</p>
<p>him to go and call him. He left, but staid quite a while, and I left the
</p>
<p>wagon myself, and, in the company of my brother Henry, one Legner and
</p>
<p>Schnaubelt, whom I had just met, went up the street to find Parsons.
</p>
<p>Schwab was not with me at that time or at any time that evening. Schnau-
</p>
<p>belt told me I had been wanted at Deering, but as I had not been at hand
</p>
<p>Schwab had gone out there. After I left the wagon I did not go to the
</p>
<p>mouth of Crane's alley. I did not even know at the time that there was an
</p>
<p>alley there at all. I did not enter the alley with Schwab, had no conversa-
</p>
<p>tion with him there in which I referred to pistols and police, and in which
</p>
<p>Schwab asked whether one would be enough, etc., nor anything of that kind.
</p>
<p>Neither did I have that conversation with anybody else. I left the wagon
</p>
<p>and moved in a southwesterly direction obliquely across the street to the
</p>
<p>corner of the Haymarket. From there I went, in company with those I
</p>
<p>mentioned, up on Randolph Street, beyond Union and pretty near Halsted
</p>
<p>Street, but, seeing only a few people, probably twenty or twenty-five, stand-
</p>
<p>ing there scattered, and not seeing Parsons, we returned, walking on the
</p>
<p>north side of Randolph Street, as we had in going down. I went on the
</p>
<p>wagon and addressed the meeting. I had no conversation with Schwab, at
</p>
<p>or about the crossing of Union Street, in which we spoke about being ready
</p>
<p>for them and that they were afraid to come. I had no such conversation

</p>
<p>with any one. I don't remember exactly of what we were speaking, but
</p>
<p>Schnaubelt and I, as we walked along, were conversing in German. I have
</p>
<p>known Schnaubelt for about two years. I think he has not been in the
</p>
<p>country more than two years. He cannot speak English at all. He wore a
</p>
<p>light gray suit that night. In returning to the wagon I went from the cor-
</p>
<p>ner of the Haymarket right straight to the wagon, in a northeasterly direc-
</p>
<p>tion. I did not, on my return, or at any time that evening, walk with Schwab
</p>
<p>across Desplaines Street to the center of the sidewalk, some fifteen feet
</p>
<p>south of Crane's alley, and at that point meet Schnaubelt, and there take
</p>
<p>anything out of my pocket, or otherwise, and give it to Schnaubelt, or any-
</p>
<p>body else, at that location.
</p>
<p>" I spoke about fifteen or twenty minutes. I began by stating that I
</p>
<p>heard a large number of patrol wagons had gone to Desplaines Street Sta-
</p>
<p>tion ; that great preparations had been made for a possible outbreak ; that
</p>
<p>the militia had been called under arms, and that I would state at the begin-
</p>
<p>ning that this meeting had not been called for the purpose of inciting a riot,
</p>
<p>but simply to discuss the situation of the eight-hour movement and the
</p>
<p>atrocities of the police on the preceding day. Then I referred to one of
</p>
<p>5 1 4 ANARCHY AND ANAR CHISTS.
</p>
<p>the morning papers of the city, in which Mr. McCormick said that I was
</p>
<p>responsible for the affair near his factory ; that I had incited the people to
</p>
<p>commit violence, etc., and I stated that such misrepresentations were made
</p>
<p>in order to discredit the men who took an active part in the movement. I
</p>
<p>stated that such outbreaks as had occurred at McCormick's, in East St.
</p>
<p>Louis, in Philadelphia, Cleveland and other places, were not the work of a
</p>
<p>band of conspirators, of a few Anarchists or Socialists, but the unconscious
</p>
<p>struggle of a class for emancipation ; that such outbreaks might be expected
</p>
<p>at any minute and were not the arbitrary work of individuals. I then
</p>
<p>pointed to the fact that the people who committed violence had never been
</p>
<p>Socialists or Anarchists, but in most instances had been up to that time the
</p>
<p>most lawful citizens, good Christians, the exemplary so-called honest work-
</p>
<p>men, who were contrasted by the capitalists with the Anarchists. I stated
</p>
<p>that the meeting at McCormick's was composed mostly of humble, church-
</p>
<p>going good Christians, and not by any means atheists, or materialists, or
</p>
<p>Anarchists. I then stated that for the past twenty years the wage-workers
</p>
<p>had asked their employers for a reduction of the hours of labor ; that, accor-
</p>
<p>ding to the statement of the secretary of the National Bureau of Labor Sta-
</p>
<p>tistics, about two millions of physically strong men were out of employment ;
</p>
<p>that the productive capacity had, by the development of machines, so im-
</p>
<p>mensely increased that all that any rationally organized society required
</p>
<p>could be produced in a few hours, and that the mechanical working of men
</p>
<p>for ten hours a day was simply another method of murdering them. Though
</p>
<p>every student of social phenomena admitted the fact that society was, under
</p>
<p>the present condition of overwork, almost retrograding and the masses
</p>
<p>sinking into degradation, still their demands have been refused. I proceeded
</p>
<p>to state that the legislators had different interests at stake than those in-
</p>
<p>volved in this question, and did not care so much about the welfare of any
</p>
<p>class of society as for their own interests, and that at last the workingmen
</p>
<p>had conceived, consciously or unconsciously, the idea to take the matter
</p>
<p>in their own hands ; that it was not a political question, but an economic
</p>
<p>question ; that neither legislatures nor Congress could do anything in the
</p>
<p>premises, but the workingmen could only achieve a normal day's work of
</p>
<p>eight hours or less by their own efforts.

<p>" I believe when I had gone so far somebody told me that Mr. Parsons
</p>
<p>had arrived. Turning around, I saw Parsons ; and as I was fatigued, worn
</p>
<p>out, I broke off and introduced Parsons. I spoke in English. After intro-
</p>
<p>ducing Parsons I staid on the wagon. When I stopped and Parsons be-
</p>
<p>gan, I believe there were pretty nearly 2,000 people there ; it was an
</p>
<p>ordinarily packed crowd. The people who wanted to listen would crowd to
</p>
<p>the wagon, others would stand on the opposite sidewalk, but I did not see
</p>
<p>any very packed crowd, exactly. While I spoke, I was facing, I believe, in a
</p>
<p>southwesterly direction ; the bulk of the audience stood around the wagon
</p>
<p>south and southwesterly toward the Haymarket. Parsons spoke forty-five
</p>
<p>minutes to an hour. He stopped about ten o'clock. I had been requested
</p>
<p>by several persons to make a German speech, but Parsons had spoken
</p>
<p>longer than I expected, it was too late, and I didn't feel much like speaking;
</p>
<p>so I asked Mr. Fielden to say a few words in conclusion and then adjourn.
</p>
<p>I introduced Fielden to the audience and remained on the wagon until the
</p>
<p>command was given by Capt. Ward to disperse. I did not see the police
</p>
<p>until they formed in columns on the corner of Desplaines and Randolph
</p>
<p>Streets. Somebody behind me, I think, said : 'The police are coming.' I
</p>
<p>SPIES ON THE STAND.
</p>
<p>could not understand that. I did not think even when I saw them that
</p>
<p>they were marching toward the meeting. The meeting was almost as well
</p>
<p>as adjourned. There were not over two hundred on the spot. About five
</p>
<p>minutes previous to that a dark cloud came moving from the north, and it
</p>
<p>looked so threateningly that most of the people ran away, and some people
</p>
<p>suggested an adjournment to Zepf's Hall ; more than two-thirds of the
</p>
<p>attendants left at that time. The police halted three or four feet south of
</p>
<p>the wagon. Capt. Ward walked up to the wagon. Fielden was standing
</p>
<p>in front of me, in the rear of the wagon. I was standing in the middle of
</p>
<p>the wagon. Ward held something in his hand, a cane or a club, and said :
</p>
<p>' In the name of the people of the State of Illinois, I command you to dis-
</p>
<p>perse,' and Fielden said : 'Why, Captain, this is a peaceable meeting.'
</p>
<p>And Ward repeated, I think, that command, and then turned around to his
</p>
<p>men, and while I didn't understand what he said to them, I thought he sai(J,
</p>
<p>* Charge upon the crowd,' or something to that effect.- I did not hear him
</p>
<p>say : ' I call upon you and you to assist ; ' he may have said that and I may
</p>
<p>have misunderstood him. My brother and one Legner and several others
</p>
<p>that I did not know stood at the side of the wagon ; they reached out their
</p>
<p>hands and helped me off the wagon. I felt very indignant over the coming
</p>
<p>of the police, and intended to ask them what right they had to break up the
</p>
<p>meeting, but I jumped down from the wagon. When I reached the side-
</p>
<p>walk I heard a terrible detonation ; I thought the city authority had brought
</p>
<p>a cannon there to scare the people from the street. I did not think they
</p>
<p>would shoot upon the people, nor did I think in the least, at that time, of a
</p>
<p>bomb. Then I was pushed along ; there was a throng of people rushing up,
</p>
<p>and I was just carried away with them. I went into Zepf's Hall. The firing
</p>
<p>began immediately, simultaneously with the explosion. I did not see any
</p>
<p>firing from the crowd upon the police. I did not hear, as I stood upon the
</p>
<p>wagon, either by Fielden or anybody else, any such exclamation as ' Here
</p>
<p>come the bloodhounds; men, do your duty and I will do mine.' Fielden
</p>
<p>did not draw a revolver and fire from the wagon upon the police or in their
</p>
<p>direction. I did not, before the explosion of the bomb, leave my position
</p>
<p>upon the wagon, go into the alley, strike a match and light a bomb in the
</p>
<p>hands of Rudolph Schnaubelt. I did not see Rudolph Schnaubelt in the

<p>at that time or any other time that evening go into the mouth of the alley
</p>
<p>and join there Fischer and Schnaubelt and strike a match for any purpose.
</p>
<p>Schnaubelt is about six feet three inches tall, I should judge, of large frame
</p>
<p>and large body.
</p>
<p>"I remember the witness Wilkinson, a reporter of the News. He was
</p>
<p>up at the office several times, but I only had one conversation with him as
</p>
<p>far as I remember. He made an interview out of it. He was introduced
</p>
<p>to me by Joe Gruenhut, who told me that the News wanted to have an
</p>
<p>article. Wilkinson inquired as to the report of some paper that the
</p>
<p>Anarchists had placed an infernal machine at the door of the house of
</p>
<p>Lambert Tree, and I told him that, in my opinion, the Pinkertons were
</p>
<p>doing such things to force people to engage them and to advertise them-
</p>
<p>selves. He then asked whether I had ever seen or possessed any bombs ?
</p>
<p>I said yes. I had had at the office for probably three years four bomb-
</p>
<p>shells. Two of them had been left at the office in my absence, by a man
</p>
<p>who wanted to find out if it was a good construction. The other two were
</p>
<p>left with me one day by some man who came, I think, from Cleveland or
</p>
<p>516 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>New York, and was going to New Zealand from here. I used to show
</p>
<p>those shells to newspaper reporters, and I showed one to Mr. Wilkinson
</p>
<p>and allowed him to take it along and show it to Mr. Stone. I never asked
</p>
<p>him for it since. That part of the conversation was at noon, while I was in
</p>
<p>a hurry. Wilkinson came in the evening again with Joe Gruenhut, and
</p>
<p>invited me to dine with him. I had just about half an hour to spend. At
</p>
<p>the table we talked about an infernal machine which had been placed a few
</p>
<p>days previous into an office of the Burlington and Quincy Railroad, and
</p>
<p>about another placed in front of Lambert Tree's house, and I gave the
</p>
<p>explanation which I have already stated. Talking about the riot drill that
</p>
<p>had shortly before been held on the lake front, and about the sensational
</p>
<p>reports published by the papers in regard to the armed organizations of
</p>
<p>Socialists, I told him that it was an open secret that some three thousand
</p>
<p>Socialists in the city of Chicago were armed. I told him that the arming
</p>
<p>of these people, meaning not only Socialists but workingmen in general,
</p>
<p>began right after the strike of 1877, when the police attacked workingmen
</p>
<p>at their meetings, killed some and wounded others ; that they were of
</p>
<p>the opinion that if they would enjoy the rights of the Constitution, they
</p>
<p>should prepare to defend them too, if necessary ; that it was a known fact
</p>
<p>that these men had paraded the streets, as many as 1,500 strong at a time,
</p>
<p>with their rifles ; that there was nothing new in that, and I could not see
</p>
<p>why they talked so much about it. And I said I thought that they were
</p>
<p>still arming and I wished that every workingman was well armed.
</p>
<p>" Then we spoke generally on modern warfare. Wilkinson was of the
</p>
<p>opinion that the militia and the police could easily defeat any effort on the
</p>
<p>part of the populace by force, could easily quell a riot. I differed from him.
</p>
<p>I told him that the views which the bourgeoise took of their military and
</p>
<p>police was exactly the same as the nobility took, some centuries ago, as to
</p>
<p>their own armament, and that gun-powder had come to the relief of the
</p>
<p>oppressed masses and had done away with the aristocracy very quickly ;
</p>
<p>that the iron armor of the nobility was penetrated by a leaden bullet just as
</p>
<p>easily as the blouse of the peasant ; that dynamite, like gunpowder, had
</p>
<p>an equalizing, leveling tendency ; that the two were children of the same
</p>
<p>parent ; that dynamite would eventually break down the aristocracy of

</p>
<p>this age and make the principles of democracy a reality. I stated that it
</p>
<p>had been attempted by such men as General Sheridan and others to play
</p>
<p>havoc with an organized body of military or police by the use of dynamite,
</p>
<p>and it would be an easy thing to do it. He asked me if I anticipated any
</p>
<p>trouble, and I said I did. He asked me if the Anarchists and Socialists
</p>
<p>were going to make a revolution. Of course I made fun of that ; told him
</p>
<p>that revolutions were not made by individuals or conspirators, but were
</p>
<p>simply the logic of events resting in the conditions of things. On the subject
</p>
<p>of street warfare I illustrated with tooth-picks the diagram which had
</p>
<p>appeared in one of the numbers of the Alarm, introduced in evidence here.
</p>
<p>I said to him that I wasn't much of a warrior, but had read a good deal on
</p>
<p>the subject, and I particularly referred to that article in the Alarm. I said
</p>
<p>that if, for instance, a military body would march up a street, they would
</p>
<p>have men on the house-tops on both sides of the street protecting and guard-
</p>
<p>ing the main body from possible onslaught, possibly by shooting, firing or
</p>
<p>throwing of bombs. Now, i'fthe revolutionists or civilians, men not belong-
</p>
<p>ing to the privileged military bodies, would form an oblique line on each
</p>
<p>side of the street at a crossing, they could then very successfully combat the
</p>
<p>SPIES ON THE STAND. 517
</p>
<p>on-marching militia and police, by attacking them with fire-arms or dyna-
</p>
<p>mite. And I used Market Square for illustration. I said there was a system
</p>
<p>of canalization in large cities. Now, supposing they expected an attack,
</p>
<p>they could, by the use of a battery and dynamite, blow up whole regiments
</p>
<p>very easily. I don't think that I said what Wilkinson testified to here in
</p>
<p>regard to the tunnel, but I may have given the talk a little color. I knew
</p>
<p>he wanted a sensational article for publication in the News, but there was
</p>
<p>no particular reference to Chicago, or any fighting on our part. The topic
</p>
<p>of the conversation was that a fight was inevitable, and that it might take
</p>
<p>place in the near future, and what might and could be done in such an event.
</p>
<p>It was a general discussion of the possibilities of street warfare under
</p>
<p>modern science.
</p>
<p>"I wrote the word ' Ruhe ' for insertion in the Arbeiter-Zeitung on May
</p>
<p>4th. It happened just the 'same as with any other announcement that
</p>
<p>would come in. I received a batch of announcements from a number of
</p>
<p>labor organizations and societies a little after eleven o'clock, in my editorial
</p>
<p>room, and went over them. Among them was one which read : ' Mr.
</p>
<p>Editor, please insert in the letter-box the word 'Ruhe,' in prominent let-
</p>
<p>ters.' This was in German. There is an announcement column of meet-
</p>
<p>ings in the Arbeiter-Zeitung, but a single word or something like that would
</p>
<p>be lost sight of under the announcements. In such cases people generally
</p>
<p>ask to have that inserted under the head of ' Letter-box.' Upon reading
</p>
<p>that request, I just took a piece of paper and marked on it 'Briefkasten'
</p>
<p>(Letter-box), and the word ' Ruhe.' The manuscript which is in evidence
</p>
<p>is in my handwriting. At the time I wrote that word and sent it up to be
</p>
<p>put in the paper, I did not know of any import whatever attached to it.
</p>
<p>My attention was next called to it a little after three o'clock in the after-
</p>
<p>noon. Balthasar Rau, an advertising agent of the Arbeiter-Zeitung, came
</p>
<p>and asked me if the word ' Ruhe' was in the Arbeiter-Zeitung. I had my-
</p>
<p>self forgotten about it, and took a copy of the paper and found it there.
</p>
<p>He asked me if I knew what it meant, and I said I did not. He said there
</p>
<p>was a rumor that the armed sections had held a meeting the night before,
</p>
<p>and had resolved to put in that word as a signal for the armed sections to
</p>
<p>keep themselves in readiness in case the police should precipitate a riot, to

</p>
<p>come to the assistance of the attacked. I sent for Fischer, who had in-
</p>
<p>vited me to speak at the meeting that evening, and asked him if that word
</p>
<p>had any reference to that meeting. He said, ' None whatever ; ' that it was
</p>
<p>merely a signal for the boys for those who were armed to keep their
</p>
<p>powder dry, in case they might be called upon to fight within the next
</p>
<p>days. I told Rau it was a very silly thing, or at least that there was not
</p>
<p>much rational sense in that, and asked him if he knew how it could be
</p>
<p>managed that this nonsense would be stopped ; how it could be undone.
</p>
<p>Rau said he knew some persons who had something to say in the armed
</p>
<p>organizations, and I told him to go and tell them that the word was put in
</p>
<p>by mistake. Rau went pursuant to that suggestion, and returned to me at
</p>
<p>five o'clock.
</p>
<p>" I was not a member of any armed section. I have not been for six
</p>
<p>years. I have had in my desk for two years two giant-powder cartridges,
</p>
<p>a roll of fuse and some detonating caps. Originally I bought them to
</p>
<p>experiment with them, as I had read a good deal about dynamite and
</p>
<p>wanted to get acquainted with it, but I never had occasion to go out for
</p>
<p>that purpose, as I was too much occupied. The reporters used to bother
</p>
<p>5i8 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>me a good deal, and when they would come to the office for something sen-
</p>
<p>sational I would show them these giant cartridges. They are the same
</p>
<p>that were referred to here by certain witnesses as having been shown on
</p>
<p>the evening of the Board of Trade demonstration. One of them will yet
</p>
<p>show a little hole in which I put that evening one of those caps, to explain
</p>
<p>to the reporter how terrible a thing it was. In fact, if that cartridge, as it
</p>
<p>is, were exploded in a free place, it would just give a detonation, and the
</p>
<p>concussion of the air might throw one on the floor, but it could do no harm
</p>
<p>to anybody. I know absolutely nothing about the package of dynamite
</p>
<p>which was exhibited here in court, and was claimed to have been found on
</p>
<p>a shelf in a closet in the Arbeiter-Zeitung building. I never saw it before
</p>
<p>it was produced here in court. I don't know anything about a revolver
</p>
<p>claimed to have been found in the Arbeiter-Zeitung. That was not my
</p>
<p>revolver, but I always carried a revolver. I had a very good revolver. I
</p>
<p>was out late at night, and I always considered it a very good thing to be
</p>
<p>in a position to defend myself. Strangely, I did not have that pistol with
</p>
<p>me on the night of the Haymarket. It was too heavy for me, and, while
</p>
<p>I took it along first, I left it with ex-Alderman Stauber on my way. I
</p>
<p>guess it is there now.
</p>
<p>" I was arrested on Wednesday morning after the Haymarket meeting,
</p>
<p>about half-past eight o'clock, at the Arbeiter-Zeitung editorial room. I had
</p>
<p>begun writing. I had come to the office a little after seven o'clock, as
</p>
<p>usual. A man who afterwards told me he was an officer, James Bonfield,
</p>
<p>asked Mr. Schwab and myself to come over to police headquarters; that
</p>
<p>Superintendent Ebersold wanted to have a talk with us on the affair of the
</p>
<p>previous night. I was very busy and asked him if it could not be delayed
</p>
<p>until after the issue of the paper. He said he would rather have me come
</p>
<p>along then, and I, unsuspectingly, went along to the station. The Superin-
</p>
<p>tendent received us by saying: 'You dirty Dutch , you dirty
</p>
<p>hounds, you rascals, we will choke you ; we will kill you.' And then they
</p>
<p>jumped upon us, tore us from one end to the other, went through our
</p>
<p>pockets, took my money and everything I had. I never said anything.
</p>
<p>They finally concluded to put us in a cell, and then Mr. Ebersold said :
</p>
<p>'Well, boys, let's be cool.' I think Mr. James Bonfield interfered during

</p>
<p>the assault made upon us by Mr. Ebersold, and suggested to him that that
</p>
<p>was not the proper way nor the proper place. I have been continuously
</p>
<p>confined from then until now."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination Spies stated :
</p>
<p>" There was in fact no editor-in-chief of the Arbeiter-Zeitung ; there was
</p>
<p>a kind of autonomous editorial arrangement, but I was looked to as the
</p>
<p>editor-in-chief. I mean in the editorial department every one wrote what
</p>
<p>he pleased, and it was published without my looking at it. I never assumed
</p>
<p>any responsibility for the editorials. I never was made responsible by the
</p>
<p>company for the management of the paper. Schwab's salary was the same
</p>
<p>as mine ; our positions were coordinate. The management of the paper
</p>
<p>was left with the board of trustees ; the editors had very little to say about
</p>
<p>it. Nobody looked over the editorials before they were inserted. Contrib-
</p>
<p>uted articles were looked over sometimes by one of the reporters, some-
</p>
<p>times by Schwab or Schroeder, or myself. Schroeder was editor for four
</p>
<p>months. I usually glanced at the paper to keep track of what it contained.
</p>
<p>Fischer was merely a compositor of the Arbeiter-Zeitung ; he had nothing to
</p>
<p>SPIES' CROSS-EXAMINATION. 519
</p>
<p>do with the editorials or management of the paper. I had nothing to do with
</p>
<p>the Alarm, except for four or five weeks, when I edited it in the absence of
</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons."
</p>
<p>"Was money ever sent you for the Alarm ? "
</p>
<p>"There was. I also paid the bills for the printing of the Alarm."
</p>
<p>" Did you ever write contributions for the Alarm ? "
</p>
<p>"I have occasionally, whenever they were in need of manuscript. Of
</p>
<p>the bombs I had I received the two iron cast ones first. That was about
</p>
<p>three years ago. A man who gave his name as Schwape or Schwoep
</p>
<p>brought them to me. I only saw him once. I think he was a shoe-
</p>
<p>maker, came from Cleveland, and left for New Zealand. He asked me
</p>
<p>if my name was Spies. I told him yes ; and he asked me if I had seen
</p>
<p>any of the bombs that they were making, or something like that. I don't
</p>
<p>know to whom he referred by 'they.' He spoke of people in Cleveland
</p>
<p>with whom he had associated ; I didn't ask him and didn't know what
</p>
<p>class of people. I said I hadn't seen any of them. I don't remember any-
</p>
<p>thing more about the conversation I had with him. I would have twelve or
</p>
<p>fifteen conversations every day ; this one was out of the order of my regular
</p>
<p>conversations ; my recollection is, I got rid of him as soon as he would
</p>
<p>leave. He left those there ; he said he would not take them along. I didn't
</p>
<p>ask him if he had any more with him. They were bombs exploding by per-
</p>
<p>cussion, heavier on one side than on the other, so that when they were
</p>
<p>thrown the cap would always come down. I think they were at the Arbeiter-
</p>
<p>Zeitung on May 4. I never saw the man before or after that. The other
</p>
<p>two bombs which Wilkinson called 'Czar bombs,' a term which I never
</p>
<p>used to him, were left one day, in my absence, in the office. When I came
</p>
<p>from dinner I saw them on my desk and was told that a man had brought
</p>
<p>them there to inquire whether they were bombs of a good construction, and
</p>
<p>the man never called for them. That was about a year and a half or two
</p>
<p>years ago. One I gave to Wilkinson ; the other one, I suppose, was at the
</p>
<p>office ever since. I don't know what became of it and of the two iron
</p>
<p>bombs. I had not seen them for some time, but I thought they were at the
</p>
<p>office. I got the dynamite about two years ago from the ytna Powder
</p>
<p>Company. I got two of those bars. My intention at first was to experiment

</p>
<p>with them." ,
</p>
<p>"What object did you have in experimenting with the dynamite?"
</p>
<p>" I had read a great deal about dynamite and thought it would be a good
</p>
<p>thing to get acquainted with its use, just the same as I would take a re-
</p>
<p>volver and go out and practice with it. I don't want to say, however, that
</p>
<p>it was merely for curiosity. I can give no further explanation. I got the
</p>
<p>caps and the fuse, because I would need them to experiment with. I was
</p>
<p>never present, to the best of my recollection, when experiments were made
</p>
<p>with dynamite. Neither bombs nor dynamite were ever distributed through
</p>
<p>the Arbeiter-Zeitung office. I did not tell Mr. Wilkinson that they were.
</p>
<p>I never handled any dynamite outside of the two cartridges ; never had
</p>
<p>anything to do with the distribution of dynamite. I know Herr Most : I
</p>
<p>guess I have known him for three years. This letter here is from Most.
</p>
<p>I do not know whether I answered that letter. I cannot remember."
</p>
<p>" In whose handwriting is this postal card ? "
</p>
<p>"It is Most's handwriting. I suppose I received it I see my address
</p>
<p>on it. I do not remember having read that postal or this letter at this date.
</p>
<p>I don't remember the contents of that letter. I have undoubtedly received
</p>
<p>520 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>and read it, but don't recollect anything about it now. I never carried on
</p>
<p>any correspondence with Most. I don't remember whether I answered the
</p>
<p>postal card, and whether I said or wrote to Most anything in regard to the
</p>
<p>inquiries made of me in this letter. I know positively I did not give him
</p>
<p>the directions where to ship the material mentioned in the letter. There
</p>
<p>may have been a letter addressed in my care which I may have sent to
</p>
<p>Most, but I know absolutely nothing outside of that.
</p>
<p>"As to the phrase,' The social revolution,' which occurs in my writings, I
</p>
<p>mean by it the evolutionary process, or changes from one system to another,
</p>
<p>which take place in society ; I meant a change from a wage system, from
</p>
<p>the present relations between labor and capital, to some other system. By
</p>
<p>the abolition of the wage system I mean the doing away with the spolia-
</p>
<p>tion of labor, making the worker the owner of his own product.
</p>
<p>" I was invited to go to the Haymarket meeting at nine o'clock on Tuesday,
</p>
<p>by Mr. Fischer. It was about eleven o'clock when I objected to that last line
</p>
<p>in the circular. I objected to that principally because I thought it was ridic-
</p>
<p>ulous to put a phrase in which would prevent people from attending the meet-
</p>
<p>ing. Another reason was that there was some excitement at that time, and
</p>
<p>a call for arms like that might have caused trouble between the police and the
</p>
<p>attendants of that meeting. I did not anticipate anything of the kind, but I
</p>
<p>thought it was not a proper thing to put that line in. I wrote the ' Revenge '
</p>
<p>circular, everything except the word ' Revenge.' I wrote the words, ' Work-
</p>
<p>ingmen, to arms ! ' When I wrote it I thought it was proper ; I don't think
</p>
<p>so now. I wrote it to arouse the working people, who are stupid and igno-
</p>
<p>rant, to a consciousness of the condition that they were in, not to submit to
</p>
<p>such brutal treatment as that by which they had been shot down at Mc-
</p>
<p>Cormick's on the previous day. I wanted them not to attend meetings under
</p>
<p>such circumstances, unless they could resist. I did not want them to do
</p>
<p>anything in particular I did not want to do anything. That I called them
</p>
<p>to arms is a phrase, probably an extravagance. I did intend that they
</p>
<p>should arm themselves. I have called upon the workingmen for years and
</p>
<p>years, and others have done the same thing before me, to arm themselves.
</p>
<p>They have a right, under the Constitution, to arm themselves, and it would
</p>
<p>be well for them if they were all armed. I called on them to arm them-

<p>selves, not for the purpose of resisting the lawfully constituted authorities
</p>
<p>of the city and county, in case they should meet with opposition from them,
</p>
<p>but for the purpose of resisting the unlawful attacks of the police or the
</p>
<p>unconstitutional and unlawful demands of any organization, whether police,
</p>
<p>militia or any other. I have not urged them in my speeches and editorials
</p>
<p>to arm themselves in order to bring about a social revolution or in order to
</p>
<p>overthrow the lawful authority of the country."
</p>
<p>The letter referred to as that of Most, which was in German, and which
</p>
<p>was dated 1884, was then put in evidence and read, as follows :
</p>
<p>1 ' Dear Spies : Are you sure that the letter from the Hocking Valley was not written by a
</p>
<p>detective ? In a week I will go to Pittsburg, and I have an inclination to go also to the
</p>
<p>Hocking Valley. For the present I send you some printed matter. There Sch. 'H.'also
</p>
<p>existed but on paper. I told you this some months ago. On the other hand I am in a con-
</p>
<p>dition to furnish 'medicine,' and the ' genuine ' article at that. Directions for use are per-
</p>
<p>haps not needed with these people. Moreover they were recently published in the ' Fr. '
</p>
<p>The appliances I can also send. Now, if you consider the address of Buchtell thoroughly
</p>
<p>reliable, I will ship twenty or twenty-five pounds But how ? Is there an express line to
</p>
<p>the place, or is there another way possible ? Paulus, the Great, seems to delight in hopping
</p>
<p>around in the swamps of the N. Y. V. Z. like a blown-up (bloated) frog. His tirades excite
</p>
<p>PARSONS ON THE STAND. 521
</p>
<p>general detestation. He has made himself immensely ridiculous. The main thing is only
</p>
<p>that the fellow cannot smuggle any more rotten elements into the newspaper company than
</p>
<p>are already in it. Iii this regard, the caution is important to be on the minute. The organ-
</p>
<p>ization here is no better nor worse than formerly. Our group has about the strength of the
</p>
<p>North Side group in Chicago ; and then, besides this, we have also the Soc. Rev. i, the
</p>
<p>Austrian League and the Bohemian League, so to say three more groups. Finally, it is easily
</p>
<p>seen that our influence with the trade organizations is steadily growing. We insert our
</p>
<p>meetings in the Fr., and cannot notice that they are worse attended than at the time when
</p>
<p>we got through weekly $1.50 to $2.00 into the mouth of the N. Y. V. Z. Don't forget to put
</p>
<p>yourself into communication with Drury in reference to the English organ. He will surely
</p>
<p>work with you much and well. Such a paper is more necessary as to the truth. This,
</p>
<p>indeed, is getting more miserable and confused from issue to issue, and in general is whist-
</p>
<p>ling from the last hole. Enclosed is a fly-leaf which recently appeared at Emden, and is
</p>
<p>perhaps adapted for reprint. Greeting to Schwab, Rau and to you. Yours,

<p>brought news from H. M. One does not know whether to rejoice over that or not. The

<p>ALBERT R. PARSONS made the following statement in his own behalf :
</p>
<p>" I have resided in Chicago for thirteen years. I was born June 20, 1848.
</p>
<p>On Sunday, May 2, I was in the city of Cincinnati, Ohio. Came back from
</p>
<p>there to Chicago on Tuesday morning, May 4th, between seven and eight
</p>
<p>o'clock. I caused a notice calling for a meeting of the American group at
</p>
<p>107 Fifth Avenue, on the evening of May 4th, to be inserted in the Daily
</p>
<p>Neivs of that evening. In the evening I left my house in company with
</p>
<p>Mrs. Holmes, my wife and two children, about eight o'clock. We walked
</p>
<p>from home until we got to Randolph and Halsted Streets. There I met two

</p>
<p>reporters that I have seen frequently at workingmen's meetings. One of
</p>
<p>them was a reporter whose name I don't know ; the other was Mr.
</p>
<p>Heineman of the Tribune. There Mrs. Holmes, my wife and children and
</p>
<p>myself took a car and rode directly to the meeting at 107 Fifth Avenue.
</p>
<p>We arrived there about half-past eight and remained about half an hour.
</p>
<p>After the business for which the meeting had been called was about through,
</p>
<p>some one, I understood it was a committee, came over from the Haymarket
</p>
<p>and said that there was a large body of people and no speakers there except
</p>
<p>Mr. Spies, and myself and Mr. Fielden were urged to come over to address
</p>
<p>the mass-meeting. After finishing up the work, we adjourned and walked
</p>
<p>over. Fielden and myself crossed the river through the tunnel. There
</p>
<p>were three or four others present, but I don't remember their names. I
</p>
<p>think it was after nine o'clock when I reached the meeting on Desplaines
</p>
<p>Street near the Haymarket. Mr. Spies was speaking. I managed to
</p>
<p>squeeze through the crowd, was assisted upon the wagon at once by some
</p>
<p>gentlemen standing about, and within a minute or two Mr. Spies concluded,
</p>
<p>stated that I had arrived and would address the meeting, and asked their
</p>
<p>attention while I was talking. I suppose I spoke about three-quarters of
</p>
<p>an hour. At the close of my speech I got down from the wagon. I think I
</p>
<p>was assisted by Henry Spies, who was standing by the wagon. Then I
</p>
<p>went to the wagon which stood about fifteen or twenty feet north of the
</p>
<p>522 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>speakers' wagon, on which my wife and Mrs. Holmes were seated, listening
</p>
<p>to us. I got into that wagon, asked them how they were enjoying them-
</p>
<p>selves, etc., and while talking with them, about ten minutes later, a coolness
</p>
<p>in the atmosphere attracted my attention. I looked up and observed white
</p>
<p>clouds rolling over from the north, and as I didn't want the ladies to get
</p>
<p>wet, I went on to the speakers' wagon and said : ' Mr. Fielden, permit me
</p>
<p>to interrupt you a moment.' 'Certainly,' he said. And I said: 'Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, it appears as though it would rain. It is getting late. We might as
</p>
<p>well adjourn anyway, but if you desire to continue the meeting longer, we
</p>
<p>can adjourn to Zepf's Hall, on the corner near by.' Some one in the crowd
</p>
<p>said : ' No, we can't ; it is occupied by a meeting of the furniture workers.'
</p>
<p>With that I looked and saw the lights through the windows of the hall, and
</p>
<p>said nothing further. Mr. Fielden remarked that it did not matter ; he had
</p>
<p>only a few words more to say. I went over again to where the ladies were,
</p>
<p>helped them off the wagon and told them to go down to this corner place,
</p>
<p>and we would all get together and go home. They walked off, and some
</p>
<p>one detained me for a moment ; then I followed them and met near the edge
</p>
<p>of the crowd a man whom I knew very familiarly Mr. Brown. I asked
</p>
<p>him to have a drink with me, as the speaking had made me hoarse, and we
</p>
<p>moved off a little in the rear of the ladies, to the saloon. There had been
</p>
<p>no appearance of the police, no explosion or any disturbance up to that
</p>
<p>time. As I entered the saloon I noticed some four or five gentlemen stand-
</p>
<p>ing at the bar. There were possibly as many as ten people sitting at tables
</p>
<p>on the other side next the wall, and about five or six men standing in the
</p>
<p>center of the floor talking to each other, among whom I noticed Mr. Malkoff,
</p>
<p>talking to a gentleman whom I did not know, but I supposed he was a
</p>
<p>reporter. He was upon the witness-stand in this trial. I believe it was Mr.
</p>
<p>Allen. The ladies took seats about ten feet from the door, in the saloon, at
</p>
<p>the end of the first table, with their backs to it, looking into the street. I
</p>
<p>said something to them, and I believe just then I introduced some one to
</p>
<p>Mrs. Parsons. Afterwards I went to the bar with Brown, and we had a
</p>
<p>glass of beer and a cigar. Then I turned around and noticed Mr. Fischer
</p>
<p>sitting at one of the tables and said a few words to him and sat down at the
</p>
<p>table for a few moments. Then I think I went around to where the ladies

</p>
<p>were, and I was standing near them looking out and wondering if the meet-
</p>
<p>ing would not close, anxious to go home. All at once I saw an illumination.
</p>
<p>It lit up the whole street, followed instantly by a deafening roar, and almost
</p>
<p>simultaneously volleys of shots followed, every flash of which, it seemed to
</p>
<p>me, I could see. The best comparison I can make in my mind is that it
</p>
<p>was as though a hundred men held in their hands repeating revolvers and
</p>
<p>fired them as rapidly as possible until they were all gone. That was the
</p>
<p>first volley. Then there were occasional shots, and one or two bullets
</p>
<p>whistled near the door and struck, the sign. I was transfixed. Mrs. Par-
</p>
<p>sons did not move. In a moment two or three men rushed breathlessly in
</p>
<p>at the door. That broke the apparent charm that was on us by the occur-
</p>
<p>rence in the street, and with that I called upon my wife and Mrs. Holmes
</p>
<p>to come with me to the rear of the saloon. We remained there, possibly,
</p>
<p>twenty minutes or so."
</p>
<p>On cross-examination Parsons said :
</p>
<p>" I was born in Montgomery, Alabama. Since I came to Chicago I
</p>
<p>worked as a type-setter for the first eight or nine years ; then for a year and

<p>PARSONS' CROSS-EXAMINATION. 523,
</p>
<p>a half myself and wife had a suit business on Larrabee street ; then for about
</p>
<p>a year and a half myself and wife made ladies' wrappers and suits, and I
</p>
<p>went out soliciting orders. For the last two years, since October, 1884,
</p>
<p>I was editor of the Alarm. It was a weekly paper for about a year, and
</p>
<p>then a semi-monthly. I wrote down the memorandum of my utterances on
</p>
<p>the night of May 4th, which I used in giving my testimony as to my speech,
</p>
<p>from time to time, as they occurred to me, and in looking over Mr. English's,
</p>
<p>report. When I referred to the methods which the Chicago Times and the
</p>
<p>Chicago Tribune and Tom Scott advised against striking workingmen, I told
</p>
<p>them they should defend themselves against such things in any way they
</p>
<p>could, by arming, if necessary. I did not mention dynamite at that meeting.
</p>
<p>I possibly mentioned it at other meetings. I said nothing about bombs that
</p>
<p>night, neither as a defensive means, or something to use against them. I
</p>
<p>did not, when I said that the present social system must be changed in
</p>
<p>the interest of humanity, explain to them how the social change should be
</p>
<p>brought about, because I did not know myself. I think I told the audience
</p>
<p>that the existing order of things was founded upon and maintained by force,
</p>
<p>and that the actions of the monopolists and corporations would drive the
</p>
<p>people into the use of force before they could obtain redress. I might have
</p>
<p>stated that I am not sure. I did not tell them that the ballot was useless
</p>
<p>for them because the majority was against them. That is not correct ; the
</p>
<p>workingmen are vastly in the majority. I did not tell them that night that
</p>
<p>the only way they could obtain their rights was by overturning the existing
</p>
<p>order of things by force. I could not tell whether there were any strikers
</p>
<p>present that night. There were very few Socialists present. I am a
</p>
<p>Socialist. I am an Anarchist, as I understand it."
</p>
<p>W. A. S. GRAHAM, a reporter with no Anarchistic tendencies, had inter-
</p>
<p>viewed Harry Gilmer at the City Hall as to what he had seen at the Hay-
</p>
<p>market and who threw the bomb.
</p>
<p>HARRY GILMER was then recalled by the defendants and stated that he
</p>
<p>had seen the gentleman (pointing to Graham) at the Central Station, and
</p>
<p>that he (Graham) asked him if he could identify the man who threw the
</p>
<p>bomb. Gilmer had answered that he could if he saw him. Witness did not
</p>
<p>say during the conversation that he saw the man throw the bomb, but that

<p>the man had his back to him and had whiskers. Witness did not say that
</p>
<p>the man was of medium size with dark clothes, and that he saw him light
</p>
<p>the fuse and throw the bomb.'
</p>
<p>Mr. Graham was recalled and stated that the man (Gilmer) just on the
</p>
<p>stand had told him that he saw the ma/i light the fuse and throw the bomb,
</p>
<p>and that he could identify him if he saw him. Gilmer told him that the
</p>
<p>man was of medium height, and thought he had whiskers and wore a soft
</p>
<p>black hat, but had his back turned toward him. On cross-examination wit-
</p>
<p>ness said :
</p>
<p>" I had this conversation about four o'clock in the afternoon of May 5th.
</p>
<p>I talked with him about three or four minutes. He said nothing about there
</p>
<p>being more than one man at that location, a knot of men, or anything of that
</p>
<p>kind. He said that one man lighted the fuse and threw the bomb ; he did
</p>
<p>524 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>not say anything about how it was lighted, whether with a match or a cigar,
</p>
<p>I did not ask him that. He said he was standing in Crane's alley when it
</p>
<p>was done.
</p>
<p>This closed the evidence for the defense, and by agreement several
</p>
<p>newspaper articles and an address of Victor Hugo to the " Rich and Poor"
</p>
<p>were introduced. The State then proceeded to put in rebutting testimony.
</p>
<p>DANIEL SCULLY, a justice of the peace, was first examined. He stated
</p>
<p>that at the preliminary examination, held on the 25th of May, Officer Wess-
</p>
<p>ler had not stated in his testimony that Stenner was the man who fired
</p>
<p>the shot from the wagon ; neither had Officer Foley so stated.
</p>
<p>" Did he, at that time, give a description of the man who fired the shot
</p>
<p>over the wagon that night as a stout man with heavy whiskers, saying at
</p>
<p>the same time that if he ever saw him again he thought he could identify
</p>
<p>him ? " "Yes, sir. Stenner was discharged upon that examination."
</p>
<p>INSPECTOR JOHN BONFIELD met Mr. Simonson, a witness in this case, at
</p>
<p>the police station on the night of the. Haymarket riot. The man was intro-
</p>
<p>duced to him by Capt. Ward as a member of the firm of J.V. Farwell & Co.
</p>
<p>"We three stood together outside of the railing. Mr. Simonson
</p>
<p>opened the conversation by remarking to me that he understood that the
</p>
<p>horses belonging to the Police Department were getting used up with the
</p>
<p>constant work they had, and that either Mr. Farwell or the firm I under-
</p>
<p>stood him to say Mr. Farwell that their horses were at our service in case
</p>
<p>we needed any horses. I told him that our teams had stood the work so
</p>
<p>far very well, but that if the troubles continued for any length of time we
</p>
<p>would likely need assistance and would call upon him if occasion demanded
</p>
<p>it, thanking him for his offer. He then spoke about the trouble at McCor-
</p>
<p>mick's and on Centre Avenue and Eighteenth Street that afternoon, and
</p>
<p>said the police ought to have dispersed those crowds ; not to have allowed
</p>
<p>them to collect. I did not, in the course of that conversation, tell him that
</p>
<p>I would like to get a crowd of 3,000 without any women and children, and
</p>
<p>in that case would make short work of them, or anything to that effect."
</p>
<p>The most important part of the work done by the State at this phase of
</p>
<p>the proceedings was the strong indorsement of Harry W. Gihner's veracity
</p>
<p>which was produced before the jury. To the credibility of this witness, and

</p>
<p>THE evidence being now all in, Francis W. Walker, Assistant State's
</p>
<p>Attorney, on the morning of August nth, began his address to the
</p>
<p>jury. Although his argument was an exceedingly lengthy one, he held his
</p>
<p>audience and the jury to the closest attention from the first word to the
</p>
<p>last. Mr. Walker began by an examination of the law, defining what is
</p>
<p>meant by the term "reasonable doubt," which he believed would be one of
</p>
<p>the arguments used by the defense. Following this he read the statutes
</p>
<p>showing what murder is, and what an accessory, under the laws of Illinois.
</p>
<p>Under the statute, as he proved, an accessory is to be held as a principal.
</p>
<p>Following this he reviewed at some length Mr. Salomon's statement, in
</p>
<p>that gentleman's opening speech, that the prisoners had been guilty, if
</p>
<p>they were guilty at all, of no crime more serious than conspiracy. Mr.
</p>
<p>Walker held that the fact that murder had followed the conspiracy proved;
</p>
<p>the conspirators murderers. His logic was clear, cogent and unanswerable..
</p>
<p>Its effect could be seen in the gloomy attention which the doomed Anar-
</p>
<p>chists paid to his fatal chain of reasoning.
</p>
<p>Leaving the authorities to one side, Mr. Walker addressed himself to>
</p>
<p>the facts made manifest by the evidence. He said :
</p>
<p>"We start out first upon the analysis of the facts of this case in this-
</p>
<p>way : Was there an unlawful combination, a conspiracy, to overthrow the
</p>
<p>systems of this Government upon the ist day of May, 1886? Was the
</p>
<p>bomb thrown on the 4th of May in pursuance of the common design ?'
</p>
<p>Are these defendants members of that conspiracy? When those questions
</p>
<p>are answered in the affirmative the guilt of each and every one of these
</p>
<p>defendants of murder is proven beyond a reasonable doubt. But, if we go>
</p>
<p>further than that, the argument would embrace the topic : Was there a mur-
</p>
<p>der committed at the Haymarket? Did the defendants aid, abet and assist
</p>
<p>the commission of that act ? Or, if they were not present aiding, abetting
</p>
<p>and assisting, had they advised, encouraged, aided and abetted the perpe-

</p>
<p>tration of the crime ? Under either aspect of this case, the defendants are
</p>
<p>guilty of murder with malice aforethought.
</p>
<p>"Was there a conspiracy? Was there a conspiracy to culminate on or
</p>
<p>about the ist day of May? Were the defendants members of that con-
</p>
<p>spiracy? Was the conspiracy unlawful? Was the bomb thrown in pursu-
</p>
<p>ance of the common design ? Let us investigate the facts and answer each
</p>
<p>proposition."
</p>
<p>Mr. Walker went into the peculiar fact that the bullets found in the
</p>
<p>526
</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>bodies of the officers were 22 and 44-caliber ; the officers carried 38-caliber.
</p>
<p>The witnesses who had appeared for the defense in this case were armed
</p>
<p>with pistols of the first-named sizes.
</p>
<p>He read to the jury many remarkable extracts from Host's writings,
</p>
<p>pointing out the peculiar and criminal teachings of that Anarchist leader,
</p>
<p>and showing how Spies and the others had in every detail of their connec-
</p>
<p>tion with the police, after the Haymarket murders, followed the printed
</p>
<p>advice given.
</p>
<p>Following is one of the extracts from Host's book :
</p>
<p>' ' Shield your person as long as there is a possibility to preserve it for future deeds, but
</p>
<p>when you see that you are irredeemably lost, then use the short respite to make the most of
</p>
<p>it for the propaganda of your principles. We have regarded it our duty to give you these
</p>
<p>instructions, the more so as we see from day to day
</p>
<p>even people who are expert in revolutionary mat-
</p>
<p>ters violating even the plainest rules. May their
</p>
<p>lives be the last which are necessary in this regard.
</p>
<p>" I read you, gentlemen, this, so that
</p>
<p>we may start out from the proper stand-
</p>
<p>point and position, before we argue as to
</p>
<p>the merits of the testimony of the defen-
</p>
<p>dants' witnesses in this case. Who are
</p>
<p>they ? Who is their advisor ? Why, they
</p>
<p>have started out in social life agreeing to
</p>
<p>swear to perjury. They belong to the
</p>
<p>Social Revolution. There is not one of
</p>
<p>them, gentlemen, that bears upon his face
</p>
<p>the stamp of sensibility or of heart, and
</p>
<p>there can be no argument made when
</p>
<p>they talk about the motive to justify mur-
</p>
<p>der and the advice of murder, only from
</p>
<p>the malignant heart. Here they picture
</p>
<p>murder and gloat over it. They feast
</p>
<p>over the description of how to poison

<p>easiest, as the hyena does over the corpse of the dead.
</p>
<p>" Host laughs in his own book. He tells to the ' mere compositor ' :
</p>
<p>' Use a dagger with grooves in it ; the poison will stay on it the more
</p>
<p>readily.' And a file is adopted for the purpose.
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen, we have found without any further analysis the reason why
</p>
<p>the defendant Parsons converted the witness-stand into a propaganda. It
</p>
<p>took him an hour by the clock here to repeat the substance of the speech
</p>
<p>that he delivered in less than three-quarters of an hour upon the Harket
</p>
<p>Square. He endeavored to deny the conspiracy by an alibi ; and I mean
</p>
<p>by that the conspiracy upon the night of Hay 4th. He only said he was in
</p>
<p>Cincinnati on Sunday, and did not get back until Tuesday morning. They
</p>
<p>never asked him if he knew what 'Ruhe' meant. They did not ask Schwab
</p>
<p>if he knew what ' Ruhe ' meant. The only defendant that they have asked
</p>
<p>as to his personal knowledge of 'Ruhe' is the defendant Fielden the only
</p>
<p>one, the only one from the beginning to the close of this case.

<p>community to overthrow the law of the State of Illinois by force, for years

<p>and years. In 1885, upon the anniversary of the birth of George Washing-
</p>
<p>ton, in the city of Grand Rapids, the arch-conspirator in this case because
</p>
<p>he is the one that is the most contemptible said in the city of Grand Rap-
</p>
<p>ids I refer you now to the testimony of Mr. Moulton and George Schook :
</p>
<p>' There are three thousand men, armed, in the city of Chicago, secretly
</p>
<p>drilled. They are known by numbers and not by names. Whoever wishes
</p>
<p>to join may join, but before you have joined you cannot know their secrets,
</p>
<p>Mr. Moulton. There will be a revolution when the eight-hour movement
</p>
<p>takes place. We will favor the eight-hour not because we believe in it, but
</p>
<p>because it will assist us in the social revolution, and the eight-hour move-
</p>
<p>ment will occur on or about the ist of May, 1886. If I fail, I shall be
</p>
<p>hanged.' And then the man that puts the word 'Ruhe' for the purpose
</p>
<p>of this case on the shoulder of Fischer, compares himself to George Wash-
</p>
<p>ington, and in his grotesque and horrible vanity says : ' I am a rebel, and if
</p>
<p>I don't succeed I shall be hanged.'
</p>
<p>" On October, 17, 1885, in the city of Chicago, at the West Twelfth Street
</p>
<p>Turner Hall, August Spies again, in a public meeting, admitted the great
</p>
<p>conspiracy and again foreshadowed the coming revolution on the first of
</p>
<p>May ; and this was published by his coordinate editor in the Alarm, at the
</p>
<p>same office, 107 Fifth Avenue, Mr. Parsons.
</p>
<p>"The defendant Spies has been upon the stand. He only denied as to

<p>a conspiracy, and never whispered a word of denial except when he got to
</p>
<p>the word ' Ruhe.' Without explanation he could never escape the effect
</p>
<p>of that word, and his explanation is the evidence of his guilt ; he tried to
</p>
<p>put that on Fischer.
</p>
<p>' 'August Spies was introduced at this point and offered the following resolutions : Whereas,
</p>
<p>a general move has been started among the organized wage-workers of this country for the
</p>
<p>establishment of an eight-hour work-=day, to begin on May i, 1886; whereas, it is to be
</p>
<p>expected that the class of professional idlers, the governing class who prey upon the bone and
</p>
<p>marrow of the useful members of society, will resist this attempt by calling to their assistance
</p>
<p>the Pinkertons, the police and State militia : Therefore, be it
</p>
<p>"Resolved, That we urge upon all wage-workers the necessity of procuring arms before the
</p>
<p>inauguration of the proposed eight-hour strike, in order to be in a position of meeting our foe
</p>
<p>with their own argument, force.

</p>
<p>" Here is shown the sincerity of these men in their endeavor to ameliorate
</p>
<p>the laborer as they call it, the wage-worker.
</p>
<p>' ' Resolved, That while we are skeptical in regard to the benefits that will accrue to the wage-
</p>
<p>worker from the introduction of the eight-hour work-day, we nevertheless pledge ourselves to
</p>
<p>aid and assist our brethren of this class with all that lies in our power as long as they show
</p>
<p>an open and defiant front to our common enemy, the labor-devouring class of aristocratic
</p>
<p>vagabonds, the brutal murderers of our comrades in St. Louis, Chicago and Philadelphia
</p>
<p>and other places. Our war-cry is, ' Death to the enemy of the human race, our despoilers.'
</p>
<p>"What does that mean ? It was published in the Alarm. Was there a
</p>
<p>conspiracy, gentlemen, against the police on the first day of May, 1886 ?
</p>
<p>After the reading, these resolutions were received with round after round
</p>
<p>of applause, and the chair was about to put a vote, when Mr. J. K. Magie
</p>
<p>arose and said that he understood a discussion of them to be in order. He
</p>
<p>denounced the revolutionary character of the resolutions. He believed
</p>
<p>that six hours of labor was enough ! This man was a labor agitator and be-
</p>
<p>lieves in the amelioration of labor. 'This is the best form of government
</p>
<p>that ever existed,' he said of this Republic. He is an American citizen and
</p>
<p>believes in the institutions of his country. ' If there are abuses, there is a
</p>
<p>proper way to correct them. Eighty per cent, of the voting population are
</p>
<p>528 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>working people ; they should strike with the ballot and not with the bullet.'
</p>
<p>Then this ameliorator of labor, August Spies, supposed that Mr. Magie did
</p>
<p>not like the terms in which the members of the Government were referred
</p>
<p>to. The reason of this was that Mr. Magie was one of those political vaga-
</p>
<p>bonds himself. There were nine millions of the best people engaged in the
</p>
<p>industrial trades of this country. There were but one million of them as
</p>
<p>yet organized one million, and by the way, that is significant in the fact
</p>
<p>that these men fought to achieve this result all over the country. Schnau-
</p>
<p>belt had said at 54 West Lake Street the night before, the 3d of May, 'We
</p>
<p>must telegraph our success to all the other cities throughout the country.'
</p>
<p>" To make the movement in which they were engaged the eight-hour
</p>
<p>movement for the ist of May a successful one, it must be a revolutionary
</p>
<p>one. 'Don't let us,' he exclaimed, 'forget the most forcible argument, the
</p>
<p>gun and dynamite.'
</p>
<p>" Was there a conspiracy ? Turn to the cross-examination of Wilkinson
</p>
<p>by Capt. Black, and find that part where Wilkinson said he had heard Joe
</p>
<p>Gruenhut say that the revolution that Spies spoke of was to occur, the con-
</p>
<p>flict was actually to occur on the ist or after the ist of May, 1886. This
</p>
<p>was brought out by Capt. Black himself on cross-examination of this wit-
</p>
<p>ness. In the first place you must remember that Lingg was in this coun-
</p>
<p>try before the Christmas of 1885, between the ist day of January and the
</p>
<p>1 4th day of January. The Czar bomb, but six or eight weeks after Lingg
</p>
<p>came here, was handed to Wilkinson by Spies the twin, the same bomb
</p>
<p>in general construction and general make-up as that used at the Haymarket
</p>
<p>on that night, made by Lingg on the afternoon of that day, or filled with
</p>
<p>dynamite on the afternoon of that day."
</p>
<p>Following this Mr. Walker reviewed Parsons' utterances in the Alarm,
</p>
<p>quoting many of them. He argued that it was this sort of language and
</p>
<p>the dynamite bomb at the Haymarket which accounted for the failure of the
</p>
<p>eight-hour movement in the United States.
</p>
<p>Coming to August Spies, he read from the Arbeiter-Zeitung the follow-
</p>
<p>ing characteristic morceau :
</p>
<p>" ' Six months ago, May 4th, when the eight-hour movement began'
</p>
<p>this is in Spies' own handwriting 'there were speakers and journals of

<p>the I. A. A.' that is the International Arbeiter Association 'who pro-
</p>
<p>claimed and wrote : " Workingmen, if you want to see the eight-hour sys-
</p>
<p>tem introduced, arm yourselves. If you don't do this you will be sent home
</p>
<p>with bloody heads, and the birds will sing May songs upon your graves."
</p>
<p>"That is nonsense," was the reply. "If the workingmen are organized
</p>
<p>they will gain the eight-hour in their Sunday clothes." Well, what do you
</p>
<p>say now? Were we right or wrong? Would the occurrence of yesterday
</p>
<p>.have been possible if our advice had been followed ? Wage-workers, yester-
</p>
<p>day the police of this city murdered at McCormick's factory four of your bro-
</p>
<p>thers, and wounded more or less,' etc. ' If the brothers who defended them-
</p>
<p>selves with stones (a few of them had little snappers in the shape of revolv
</p>
<p>ers) had been provided with good weapons and one single dynamite bomb,
</p>
<p>not one of the murderers would have escaped their well-merited fate.'
</p>
<p>"The police went up there; they were nearly being murdered with
</p>
<p>stones ; the mob were throwing at them before they ever fired a shot ; and
</p>
<p>this man the next day writes: 'Had they' the mob 'been provided
</p>
<p>THE CALL TO ARMS. 529
</p>
<p>with good weapons and one single dynamite bomb, not one of the mur-
</p>
<p>derers would have escaped his well-deserved fate. ' Then see : 'As it was,
</p>
<p>only four of them were disfigured. That is too bad."
</p>
<p>"Here, here is a man that has no design upon the police, don't believe
</p>
<p>in force. ' That is too bad. The massacre of yesterday took place in order
</p>
<p>to fill the forty thousand workingmen of this city with fear and terror ;
</p>
<p>took place in order to force back,' etc. ' Will they succeed in this ? Will
</p>
<p>they not find at last that they have miscalculated ? The near future will
</p>
<p>answer this question. We will not anticipate the course of events with
</p>
<p>surmises.'
</p>
<p>"That is what he himself said. If one single bomb had been used it
</p>
<p>would have been different. He sees these eight thousand men at his back,
</p>
<p>returns immediately to the office of the Arbeiter-Zeitung and writes out this,
</p>
<p>(indicating the Revenge circular). What did he mean ? What did he
</p>
<p>mean? 'Revenge.' He says he did not write the word 'Revenge' in
</p>
<p>English. Rache, Rache, Revenge, Revenge he never denied that he wrote
</p>
<p>it in the German language, nor any witness for him ; but it makes no
</p>
<p>difference whether he wrote it, or whether he did not write it. He wrote
</p>
<p>'To arms;' he says, 'To arms, workingmen, to arms.' What does that
</p>
<p>mean ? Did anybody say at the Haymarket, ' Here come the bloodhounds ;
</p>
<p>you do your duty and I will do mine ' ? Let us see. ' The bloodhounds '
</p>
<p>was the common expression from the lips of these defendants as the desig-
</p>
<p>nation for the police. Spies says in English did he mean this or
</p>
<p>didn't he ?"
</p>
<p>Mr. Walker here read the text of the " Revenge " circular, both the
</p>
<p>English and German versions, as given in a previous chapter, and continued :
</p>
<p>' ' Is that meaningless ? ' To arms, we call you to arms. ' Why, it is the
</p>
<p>cry of the revolutionist ; it is the cry of the Communist ; it is the cry of the
</p>
<p>Anarchist ; it is the cry of Spies and Parsons ' To arms, to arms ! ' And
</p>
<p>yet the English was tame in comparison to the German version.
</p>
<p>" Did they have no design upon individuals in this conspiracy ? Why,
</p>
<p>they had the most awful, damning malice against the police. It was the
</p>
<p>motive-hunting of a motiveless malignity. Without reason and without cause
</p>
<p>they had individualized the police ; but Bonfield for the second time stood

</p>
<p>in the way of the Social Revolution. Just see how it forces up the blood
</p>
<p>of this social revolutionist : 'The bloodhounds, the police are at you, in
</p>
<p>order to cure you, with bullets, of your dissatisfaction. Slaves, we ask, we
</p>
<p>conjure you by all that is sacred and dear to you, avenge '- what does
</p>
<p>that mean ? What difference does it make whether he wrote revenge at
</p>
<p>the head of this circular or not ? He wrote it in it. What did it mean ?
</p>
<p>What did those conspirators mean?
</p>
<p>" Avenge the atrocious murder which has been committed upon your brothers to-day,
</p>
<p>and which will be likely to be committed upon you to-morrow. Avenge, laboring men.
</p>
<p>Hercules, you have arrived at the crossway. Which way will you decide, for slavery and
</p>
<p>hunger, or for freedom and bread ? If you decide for the latter, then don't delay a moment.
</p>
<p>Then, people, to arms ! Annihilation, annihilation to the beasts in human form who call
</p>
<p>themselves your rulers. Uncompromising annihilation to them. This must be your motto.
</p>
<p>Think of the heroes whose blood has fertilized the road to progress, liberty and humanity,
</p>
<p>and strive to become worthy of them. Your brothers.
</p>
<p>"Thousands of these were circulated throughout the city. Does that
</p>
<p>mean that there was a conspiracy and no malice against individuals ?
</p>
<p>530 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>"And then on Monday night a meeting at 54 West Lake Street took
</p>
<p>place, which has not been denied, and there were Lingg and Engel and
</p>
<p>Fischer. Engel's plan was again reiterated ; Lingg was to make the bombs,
</p>
<p>and Lingg was there to say he could make the bombs. He may have been
</p>
<p>to the Carpenters' meeting before that. When" he left the 54 West Lake
</p>
<p>Street meeting, he met Lehman upon the way home Gustav Lehman, who
</p>
<p>testified he got the bombs from Lingg and he said to Lehman, ' If you
</p>
<p>want to know anything, you come to 58 Clybourn Avenue to-morrow night. '
</p>
<p>In response to the question, ' What has been going on in the meeting at 54
</p>
<p>West Lake Street, in the basement ? '
</p>
<p>" At that meeting at 54 West Lake Street were represented all the
</p>
<p>different Socialistic and Anarchistic organizations. ' Y, Come Monday
</p>
<p>night,' had brought delegates, according to Waller's testimony, from every
</p>
<p>group in the city. The West Side, the South Side, Southwest Side, the
</p>
<p>North Side, every group was represented, and the Lehr und Wehr Verein
</p>
<p>also had its delegates. The plan was arranged that on to-morrow, if the
</p>
<p>revolution took place in the daytime, and the conflict had occurred, the
</p>
<p>word ' Ruhe ' should be published, all the men should be at their outlying
</p>
<p>groups ready to annihilate the police, the fire department, to cut the tele-
</p>
<p>graph wires, and to prevent communication with the central meeting at the
</p>
<p>Haymarket. Waller had suggested that this meeting be at Market Square ;
</p>
<p>Fischer says : 'No; that is a mouse trap; we will make it the Hay-
</p>
<p>market.' And then Spies takes it up north of the alley, north of the inter-
</p>
<p>section of the street and, by the way, that block has more alleys than per-
</p>
<p>haps any other block in the city of Chicago, and more means of escape
</p>
<p>and locates that meeting just where he had located the street battle in his
</p>
<p>description to Mr. Wilkinson, and as Parsons had explained street warfare
</p>
<p>in the Alarm.
</p>
<p>"Who called the meeting at the Haymarket to order on Desplaines
</p>
<p>Street beyond the alley ? Spies. He had written with his own hand the
</p>
<p>word ' Ruhe.' He was after the social revolution. Why did he move the
</p>
<p>meeting to that place if he knew what ' Ruhe ' meant ? Why was he there
</p>
<p>at all if he knew what ' Ruhe ' meant ? He has told. Why was he on the
</p>
<p>wagon if he knew what ' Ruhe ' meant ? Why didn't he notify the police,

</p>
<p>if he knew what ' Ruhe' meant, not to come to that meeting ? Why had he
</p>
<p>said upon the wagon, ' If you want to do anything, why don't you do it and
</p>
<p>say nothing ? ' if he knew what ' Ruhe ' meant ? Why did he leave his
</p>
<p>revolver before he ever got to that meeting unless he knew what ' Ruhe '
</p>
<p>meant ? He follows out his own instructions in the Arbeiter-Zeitung, on that
</p>
<p>subject, when some one wrote :
</p>
<p>" In the action itself one must be personally at the place to select personally that point
</p>
<p>on the place of the action and that part of the action which are the most important and are
</p>
<p>coupled with the greatest danger, upon which depend chiefly the success or failure of the
</p>
<p>whole affair.
</p>
<p>"And he selected the place himself. Fischer says : 'No, the Market
</p>
<p>Square is a mouse trap,' and they named they Haymarket, and Spies
</p>
<p>designates the place of meeting and publishes the word ' Ruhe ;' and then
</p>
<p>it is expected from twenty-five to forty thousand people will be at the meet-
</p>
<p>ing on Haymarket Square. Eight thousand had rebelled at McCormick's ;
</p>
<p>the skirmish lines had met, and it was expected that there would be twenty-
</p>
<p>five thousand at the Haymarket on that night ; but there were not, and for
</p>
<p>that reason this mob was not dispersed. The police could not see at any
</p>
<p>THERE A CONSPIRACY?" 531
</p>
<p>time a meeting so large as to be beyond their control, but when this meet-
</p>
<p>ing became boisterous it was after ten o'clock, two hours later than the
</p>
<p>meeting was called for. If the police had been but two hours earlier in
</p>
<p>dispelling the meeting the flames would have been lighted out at Wicker
</p>
<p>Park ; the instrument of fire described in Herr Host's book, and found at
</p>
<p>Wicker Park, was for that purpose. The Northwestern group was to meet
</p>
<p>at Wicker Park, and come down past North Avenue Station. The North Side
</p>
<p>group was to annihilate the North Side Station, and Lingg was at his post
</p>
<p>of duty for that purpose.
</p>
<p>"Was there a conspiracy? They take the word and Spies publishes it.
</p>
<p>He says in explanation : 'Among the announcements it came to me by no
</p>
<p>person of whom I am aware, no one about whom I know anything.' No
</p>
<p>questions were asked. In this way the mere editor, Spies, publishes in
</p>
<p>the Briefkasten the word ' Ruhe ' prominently. The Briefkasten is
</p>
<p>used to answer private correspondence, personal letters and editor-
</p>
<p>ials, or it is used to place the advertisements of secret meetings in,
</p>
<p>and for no other purpose. 'Y Come Monday night,' is found in the Let-
</p>
<p>ter-box of the Arbeiter-Zeitung. That is a secret thing, and means that the
</p>
<p>armed groups shall meet at 54 West Lake Street. ' Ruhe ' was an answer
</p>
<p>to no correspondent ; the word ' Ruhe ' could enlighten no ignorant man on
</p>
<p>the subject alone ; and the editor-in-chief of the Arbeiter-Zeitung picked up
</p>
<p>a piece of paper and wrote ' Ruhe ' on it without ever knowing what it
</p>
<p>meant or where it came from, and says it was handed him among the labor
</p>
<p>announcements : ' Mr. Editor, please publish the word " Ruhe " in the Let-
</p>
<p>ter box prominently.' What tells you that it was a labor announcement?
</p>
<p>Who ever said it was a labor announcement ? ' Ruhe,' peace, rest, quiet
</p>
<p>'Ruhe' a labor announcement ! Why, who said so? It would be lost if
</p>
<p>put in the announcements of labor organizations. ' Mr. Editor, pub-
</p>
<p>lish the word " Ruhe" in the column where you put " Y Come Monday
</p>
<p>night," the secret sign of the armed sections, and publish it prominently/
</p>
<p>Without a word he did so, and he asks you to believe it. Did he know
</p>
<p>what ' Ruhe ' meant ? Why, he sent for Fischer, and Fischer told him it was
</p>
<p>harmless. ' Why,' he said, ' that is foolish, Fischer ; don't do that, don't
</p>
<p>do that.' Rau had only told him that it meant : ' Workmen, be at your

</p>
<p>groups, keep yourselves armed and in preparation, so that if you' are
</p>
<p>attacked you can defend yourselves ; workingmen, arm yourselves and be at
</p>
<p>your groups.' That is what Rau said 'Ruhe' meant, and, when asked,
</p>
<p>Fischer says: 'Why, that means, "Keep your powder dry," that is all. 1
</p>
<p>' Well,' he says, ' Fischer, that is foolish ; that is crazy ; why, I cannot have
</p>
<p>that.' What did he think was foolish and crazy? To keep their powder
</p>
<p>dry, when this man had said the day before, 'Workingmen, arm yourselves,
</p>
<p>arm yourselves !' This is the explanation of the word ' Ruhe.'
</p>
<p>" Did Parsons know of the conspiracy ' Ruhe ' ? He was a party to the
</p>
<p>great conspiracy, for he had cried about April 24th for the revolution upon
</p>
<p>the ist of May. That he has not denied; and to my mind he cuts one of
</p>
<p>the worst figures in this case. He was born at least upon American soil, and
</p>
<p>he stands here alone, alone amongst these vast hordes of witnesses who are
</p>
<p>not citizens of our republic, and whose purpose is her destruction. Albert
</p>
<p>R. Parsons is the only American, and he has no right, no right to belong to
</p>
<p>that nationality. He never said he did not know of the conspiracy, and he
</p>
<p>spoke of the 4th of May; it was said that night he staid away by the way,
</p>
<p>he left this out 'I should be accused of cowardice;' but he did say, 'I
</p>
<p>532 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>would come if I were to die before morning. ' Did he know of the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy? Why, he had been in it for years. He published the order of
</p>
<p>street fighting in his Alarm, foreshadowing the battle in his description ;
</p>
<p>and not only did he do that, but he made the alibi by calling at the Ameri-
</p>
<p>can group on that night, a group organized and holding a meeting for the
</p>
<p>sewing girls when not a sewing girl was present, with no one there but a
</p>
<p>Nihilist, a Communist, a Socialist and an Anarchist. Mrs. Parsons was
</p>
<p>there and Mrs. Holmes. Where was any sewing girl ?
</p>
<p>" And here I want to ask you if, after hearing all the proof in this case ;
</p>
<p>if, after reading Most's ' Revolutionary War,' the instructions to the Nihil-
</p>
<p>ists and Anarchists ; if after reading the Alarm here ; if, after hearing the
</p>
<p>testimony of the witnesses, you will here and to-day say that the men lied
</p>
<p>who on that night stood when Captain Bonfield said ' Fall in ' stood there
</p>
<p>when the concussion had riven to the earth sixty of Chicago's noblest men
</p>
<p>because they had courage. When, out of the hundred and eighty, sixty lay
</p>
<p>wounded on the ground, the other one hundred and twenty killed the revo-
</p>
<p>lution with one blow. The men whose lives were spared fell in, and not a
</p>
<p>man has lived to say there was a coward in the whole one hundred and
</p>
<p>eighty."
</p>
<p>In the same manner he went through the evidence proving the guilt of
</p>
<p>Schwab, Fielden and Neebe.
</p>
<p>"Was Engel in the conspiracy? He proposed the plan at both
</p>
<p>meetings. He said to Captain Schaack, at the Chicago Avenue Station,
</p>
<p>that 'what was in him had to come oiit,' and he called it the dangerous
</p>
<p>power of internal eloquence. He planned the conspiracy of the Emma Street
</p>
<p>meeting, and has been an Anarchist for years, and instructor in the use of
</p>
<p>weapons, and adviser in the making of bombs. He not only was that, but
</p>
<p>he absolutely and unqualifiedly advised the Socialists to buy weapons for
</p>
<p>the express purpose of killing the police, maiming them, and then with all
</p>
<p>the cunning of a conspirator who has placed his neck within the noose, on
</p>
<p>the morning of the 4th of May he finds this infernal machine and takes it
</p>
<p>to the Chief of Police, and then comes the exhibition between Captain Bon-
</p>
<p>field and the leading counsel for the defense on that proposition. The
</p>
<p>counsel says : ' He brought it to you freely/ and he emphasized it, and

</p>
<p>then the tinner came, and the counsel says : ' What is there about this
</p>
<p>piece of iron that makes you identify it ? You only made that sheet ; is
</p>
<p>that all ? You just cut a piece of iron off for Mr. Engel.' The witness says :
</p>
<p>' Please look at the mark on the inside ; that is my mark.' Was Engel in
</p>
<p>the conspiracy ?
</p>
<p>" Was Fischer, the lieutenant of Spies, in the conspiracy ? Was Fischer,
</p>
<p>the messenger of Spies to the meeting at 54 West Lake Street, in the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy? He was at the office on Monday afternoon between five and- six
</p>
<p>o'clock, when the ' Revenge ' circular was printed, and from there he went
</p>
<p>to 54 West Lake Street. Was he in the conspiracy the man with the
</p>
<p>revolver nearly two feet long, and with the file dagger with grooves ? What
</p>
<p>does that mean ? Why, prussic acid evaporates ; it dries off the instrument.
</p>
<p>'Use something with grooves.' And the revolutionists must use files that
</p>
<p>are ground down, in order to have an instrument that is capable of holding
</p>
<p>poison. If you remember, there was another file dagger found in the office
</p>
<p>of the Arbeiter-Zeitung besides this one. Verdigris, which any one can
</p>
<p>easily produce by dipping copper or brass into vinegar, and exposing it to

<p>BOMBS AND POISONED DAGGERS. 533
</p>
<p>the atmosphere, may also be mixed with gum arabic and applied to weap-
</p>
<p>ons, but the weapons ought to be grooved, so that the poison will remain on
</p>
<p>easier and in larger quantities. That is the explanation of the file dagger
</p>
<p>and the revolver. Was Fischer in the conspiracy, with the Lehr und Wehr
</p>
<p>Verein belt strapped upon his person, and traveling in the streets of the city
</p>
<p>of Chicago with an armament worse than any Western outlaw because no
</p>
<p>outlaw ever carried on his person a dagger grooved, the slightest scratch of
</p>
<p>which meant death. It was conceived by nobody except the mind of the
</p>
<p>revolutionist and lieutenant of Spies.
</p>
<p>" Was Lingg in the conspiracy? He made the very bomb that was used
</p>
<p>on that night, and it was used on that night in furtherance of the common
</p>
<p>design. Do you remember the analysis of that bomb ? Do you remember
</p>
<p>the nuts used to fasten the half-globes together, identical with the one found
</p>
<p>in the wounded man upon the night of May 4 ? Do you remember Neff's
</p>
<p>testimony and Seliger's testimony that after the bomb had been thrown, and
</p>
<p>Lingg was at 58 Clybourn Avenue, some one accused him and said : ' You
</p>
<p>are responsible for all this see what you have done'? Hubner said:
</p>
<p>'You are responsible for all this.' This does not come from the lips of any
</p>
<p>indicted man, but from the lips of Mr. Neff, the proprietor at the place 58
</p>
<p>Clybourn Avenue. Then Louis Lingg goes home and complains because he
</p>
<p>has been upbraided for his good work in this case, and then he flees,
</p>
<p>changes his appearance and he is the only living man that changes his
</p>
<p>appearance in this case except the bomb-thrower. They are the two who
</p>
<p>shaved and cut their hair Louis Lingg and Rudolph Schnaubelt. Was
</p>
<p>Lingg in the conspiracy ? He was not only in the conspiracy, but he did
</p>
<p>everything in the world to carry out his part of it that night. ' Lehman,
</p>
<p>you come to 58 Clybourn Avenue to-night, and you will find out what the
</p>
<p>meeting in the basement at 54 meant.' And Lehman came, and on the next
</p>
<p>day he was at Lingg's house, and bomb after bomb was distributed from
</p>
<p>that place before night. Where was Lingg in the morning, between eight
</p>
<p>and one ? Looking after the revolution in the central part of the city. Men
</p>
<p>coming and going all day after bombs and with bombs as Mrs. Seliger
</p>
<p>says all day long, taking them away from that place.
</p>

<p>make haste ! ' ' Put the cloth over your heads so that you can't get head-
</p>
<p>ache. Make haste. These bombs must be done so as to be used to-night ! '
</p>
<p>What a nice thing it would be, as he and Seliger stood at the corner of
</p>
<p>North Avenue and Larrabee Street, to throw a bomb in that station, Lingg
</p>
<p>says. .Then it is 10:30, and the telephone has called for assistance from
</p>
<p>the North Avenue Station, and the patrol wagon goes out, and there stand
</p>
<p>Lingg and Seliger with bombs, and Lingg says, ' Seliger, give me a light ;
</p>
<p>they are going to the assistance of the others. It has happened ; the
</p>
<p>revolution has come. Give me a light ' and here I am reminded that
</p>
<p>when a man throws a bomb in furtherance of the social revolution they do
</p>
<p>it by twos ; one furnishes the light and the other throws the bomb. And this
</p>
<p>shows that it was not a solitary and single instance that occurred in the
</p>
<p>alley south of Crane's when a match was lighted and Schnaubelt threw the
</p>
<p>bomb. The same thing was duplicated by Lingg and Seliger when Seliger
</p>
<p>was to furnish the light and Lingg throw the bomb. It was only because
</p>
<p>Seliger hesitated that those men were not killed by Lingg at North Avenue.
</p>
<p>Was Lingg in this conspiracy then ? Why, he fled the next day, and he is
</p>
<p>the man who had the courage to give up all hope. You see, Lingg is a
</p>
<p>534 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>practical annihilator. He don't believe in preaching ; he believes in acting,
</p>
<p>and not only believes in it, but he will do it at any time. He saw Schuettler
</p>
<p>come into the room and jumped upon him the moment he passed the door,
</p>
<p>with one of those large revolvers. And then you will remember the fight
</p>
<p>and struggle there. Host's book says when there is a possibility to annihi-
</p>
<p>late an opposing party, or where it becomes a question of life and death,
</p>
<p>that death or resistance, or both, are advisable.
</p>
<p>" That is the advice that Lingg acted on and that Spies acted on, but :
</p>
<p>' If you are sure that the arrest is made only on vague suspicion, then submit
</p>
<p>to the inevitable. It is easier in such case to extract yourself again. Prove
</p>
<p>an alibi.' Was Lingg in this conspiracy? Was it a Lingg bomb ? Hub-
</p>
<p>ner, Neff and Seliger swear that Hubner said to Lingg, ' You are responsible
</p>
<p>for this, Louis Lingg,' and they had a dispute and a violent discussion
</p>
<p>when it was discovered there. After he tries to throw the bomb at the
</p>
<p>station he goes home and he sees ' Ruhe,' and he is almost crazy, and he
</p>
<p>wants to go to the Haymarket, and he goes back to 58 Clybourn Avenue
</p>
<p>and finds that it is over and that the revolution is not accomplished ; and
</p>
<p>then he gets angry because he is upraided as the one to blame for the whole
</p>
<p>thing. ' You have done this,' Hubner tells him. Hubner was there all
</p>
<p>day and helped to make bombs, and Muntzenberg and the Lehmans were
</p>
<p>in and out all day. Was it Louis Lingg's bomb ? "
</p>

</p>
<p>Alley Enigma.
</p>
<p>ON the morning of August 12, Mr. Sigismund Zeisler opened his argu-
</p>
<p>ment on behalf of the defendants. In view of the desperate condition
</p>
<p>of his case Mr. Zeisler made an able and ingenious plea. His argument
</p>
<p>occupied a whole day.
</p>
<p>During the morning hour, he elaborated at some length upon his theory
</p>
<p>of the law, and claimed that it was not only necessary to establish that the
</p>
<p>defendants were parties to a conspiracy, but it was also necessary to show
</p>
<p>that somebody who was a party to that conspiracy had committed an act in
</p>
<p>pursuance of that conspiracy. Besides that it was essential that the State
</p>
<p>should identify the principal. This, he held, was the law of the State and of
</p>
<p>the land and of the Constitution of the United States. If the principal is
</p>
<p>not identified, then no one could be held as accessory. Upon this theory
</p>
<p>the case should stand or fall, and it was for this reason that the defense
</p>
<p>endeavored to impeach the testimony of Harry L. Gilmer, as that testi-
</p>
<p>mony, he maintained, was vital for the case. Mr. Walker, he said, had
</p>
<p>stated that there was a conspiracy to inaugurate the social revolution on
</p>
<p>the ist of May, citing in support of the claim the conversation between
</p>
<p>Spies and Moulton at Grand Rapids, a resolution adopted at the West
</p>
<p>Twelfth Street Turner Hall in October, 1885, and a conversation between
</p>
<p>Spies and Reporter Wilkinson ; but after showing the general drift of those
</p>
<p>conversations and the tenor of the resolutions, Mr. Zeisler contended that
</p>
<p>the reports of these matters in the newspapers at the time could not be
</p>
<p>accepted as evidence, as newspapers are frequently given to misstatements.
</p>
<p>Then, referring to the testimony given by the parties named, he said :
</p>
<p>"Now, what does that testimony amount to? the testimony of Mr.
</p>

</p>
<p>Moulton, the testimony of Mr. Wilkinson and the testimony in regard to
</p>
<p>the resolutions adopted at the West Twelfth Street Turner Hall? Nothing
</p>
<p>but the fact which is known to all Chicago, that the laboring classes had
</p>
<p>combined to fight for an eight-hours' work-day on and after the ist of May.
</p>
<p>That is one thing. And another thing, as far as these resolutions are con-
</p>
<p>cerned, that it was resolved that, inasmuch as the workingmen had to anti-
</p>
<p>cipate that the employers would call out the police and militia against them,
</p>
<p>536
</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS,
</p>
<p>that they should arm themselves to meet the employers by the same means
</p>
<p>that they, the employers, used.
</p>
<p>" Now, further than that, Mr. Spies has spoken with Mr. Moulton and
</p>
<p>with Mr. Wilkinson about the coming social revolution ; and when asked
</p>
<p>by Mr. Moulton, ' How can you ever accomplish such a result? How can
</p>
<p>you ever bring about the social revolution ? Under what circumstances
</p>
<p>can it be done ? ' he says it can be done at a time when the workingmen
</p>
<p>will be unemployed. Substantially the same thing was said to Mr. Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son at the time of that interview last January. Now, the State's Attorney
</p>
<p>and his associates argue to you that Spies said himself the social revolu-
</p>
<p>tion is coming. When is it coming? On the ist of May. Can that be
</p>
<p>taken literally ?"
</p>
<p>Mr. Zeisler held that in the progress of the civilized world a social revo-
</p>
<p>lution was inevitable, not by the use of dy-
</p>
<p>namite or force, but by the peaceable forces
</p>
<p>at work among the people.
</p>
<p>" Now, the attorneys for the State talk
</p>
<p>to you about the social revolution, and try
</p>
<p>to make you believe that the social revolu-
</p>
<p>tion means bombs and dynamite, and killing
</p>
<p>and arson and murder and all crimes that
</p>
<p>we know of. Mr. Fielden on the stand gave
</p>
<p>the proper expression. Asked whether he
</p>
<p>believed in the revolution, he said : ' Yes,
</p>
<p>in the evolutionary revolution. ' And I tell
</p>
<p>you, gentlemen of the jury, this social revo-
</p>
<p>lution is corning this social revolution in
</p>
<p>the sense in which Webster defines the word
</p>
<p>Socialism."
</p>
<p>Mr. Zeisler next said that they had not
</p>
<p>denied that the defendants had declared
</p>
<p>that they would head a procession to go and
</p>
<p>sack Marshall Field's or Kellogg's store, because it was a fact, but asked if

</p>
<p>after such advice any one of them had taken the lead in any such proces-
</p>
<p>sion. " No, sir," he said. " They went and armed themselves with beer.
</p>
<p>That is what they did." On the night of the Board of Trade opening,
</p>
<p>Parsons and Fielden proposed to lead the crowd to attack the groceries and
</p>
<p>clothing houses, but what did they do ? They gracefully retired into the
</p>
<p>room of the Arbeitcr-Zeitung office and were interviewed by a reporter about
</p>
<p>the terrible effects of a fulminating cap. Did any one come up and inquire
</p>
<p>why they had not led the procession to those places ? They did not, as
</p>
<p>ever)-body understood what was meant. Mr. Zeisler continued :
</p>
<p>"The listeners of these people are not very highly educated men. They
</p>
<p>are laboring men who, raised in poor families, did not have the benefits of
</p>
<p>a collegiate education ; men who since that time worked at manual labor
</p>
<p>from the early morning until the late evening. They could not in the nature
</p>
<p>of things be very intelligent and highly cultivated and educated. Now,
</p>
<p>SIGISMUND ZEISLER.
</p>
<p>From a Photograph.
</p>
<p>THE RIGHT TO PROPERTY. 537
</p>
<p>Fielden and Parsons and Spies could not talk to those men by stating to>
</p>
<p>them abstract principles of social science ; but they told them : ' Here,
</p>
<p>look at this state of things. There is a man who owns three hundred mill-
</p>
<p>ion dollars ; there is another man who owns one hundred million. Yoa
</p>
<p>starve, you get starvation wages. Is that a just condition of things ?
</p>
<p>Now, I tell you, Mr. Marshall Field, who owns twenty-five millions of dollars,
</p>
<p>has no right to own them. I tell you, you have a right to take from the
</p>
<p>property which he has accumulated ; part of it belongs to you. By nat-
</p>
<p>ural, by equitable laws this man is not entitled to live in a palace while you
</p>
<p>starve. I am going to lead you down, if you want me, at once, and we
</p>
<p>will supply our wants from there.' What is that ? Is that an offer to go
</p>
<p>there ? Is that an advice to go there ? It is an illustration, as you give it
</p>
<p>in school to a child which cannot understand abstract principles of science.
</p>
<p>When they say to them : ' You have a right to take from Marshall Field
</p>
<p>and Kellogg,' that means simply in the present state of society that is.
</p>
<p>allowed, but this is not a just and equitable condition of affairs, and if it
</p>
<p>were as it ought to be you would have a right to share with Marshall Field
</p>
<p>what he owns. Take it in this common-sense view and don't allow your-
</p>
<p>selves to be deceived by declamations on the part of the attorneys for the
</p>
<p>State.
</p>
<p>"Can a revolution be made? A revolution is a thing which develops,
</p>
<p>itself, but no single man nor a dozen of men can control the inauguration of
</p>
<p>a revolution. The social revolution was fixed for the ist of May ! Just
</p>
<p>think of it ! The social revolution, the revolution by which the present state
</p>
<p>of proprietary conditions should be changed all over the world, was to be
</p>
<p>inaugurated by Mr. Spies and by Mr. Parsons and Mr. Fielden on the
</p>
<p>first day of May ! Has ever a ridiculous statement like that been made to
</p>
<p>an intelligent jury? But all that is told you not because they believe it, but
</p>
<p>because they want to make you blind to the real issues in this case, by tell-
</p>
<p>ing you that the social revolution was coming on the ist of May, and that.
</p>
<p>Inspector Bonfield by his cry, ' Fall in, fall in,' on the night of May 4th,
</p>
<p>saved the country from the social revolution ; by that they want to deceive
</p>
<p>you, they want to scare you, they want to show you the monstrosity of these-
</p>
<p>defendants. The social revolution to be brought about or inaugurated by

</p>
<p>the throwing of a bomb on the night of May 4th ! What do you take these
</p>
<p>men for ? Are they fools ? Are they children ? Don't you see what their
</p>
<p>ideal is, and the last aim and end of theirs ? It is the social revolution, yes,
</p>
<p>but not the social revolution brought about by 'the throwing of dynamite*.
</p>
<p>It is the social revolution which will give the poor man more rights and
</p>
<p>which will do away with pauperism. And the means are left to the future ;
</p>
<p>but for the present, in order that you may be strong and respected and be
</p>
<p>a power in the land, arm yourselves, organize. That is the meaning of it."
</p>
<p>Mr. Zeisler then touched on the preparation of bombs and dynamite
</p>
<p>for that social revolution, referring to the evidence showing the finding of
</p>
<p>dynamite and bombs in the Arbeiter-Zeitung office. He held that Linne-
</p>
<p>meyer, who calcimined the closet in which the bag of dynamite was found,,
</p>
<p>had proven that there was nothing of the kind there when he went in to
</p>
<p>search for a brush just immediately preceding the arrival of the police. He
</p>
<p>also pointed to a contradiction in the testimony of one of the officers that
</p>
<p>the dynamite was found on a floor below that of the closet, in a room not
</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>used by Spies and not occupied by him at the time of the police search,
</p>
<p>but in the counting-room, and then the subsequent correction by the officer,
</p>
<p>on being recalled by the State, that the package was found in Spies' edi-
</p>
<p>torial room. In reference to the bombs there was no secrecy, and Spies
</p>
<p>.admitted that he had one more bomb than the police had discovered. That
</p>
<p>information was volunteered on the witness-stand, and the possession of
</p>
<p>those bombs explained.
</p>
<p>"That is the testimony in regard to the arsenal of dynamite and bombs
</p>
<p>and weapons of destruction at 107 Fifth Avenue, and Mr. Spies bragged
</p>
<p>about three thousand revolutionists ready to throw bombs and to annihilate
</p>
<p>the police. What was it ? Braggadocio ; the same object which all these
</p>
<p>people had in advocating the use of force, in calling upon workingmen to
</p>
<p>.arm themselves, to organize, to buy weapons and all that sort of thing ; and
</p>
<p>the purpose for which they did it openly and publicly was the same purpose
</p>
<p>Mr. Spies had in bragging that there were three thousand revolutionists to
</p>
<p>;scare the capitalists, to scare them into yielding to the demands of the
</p>
<p>workingmen, to try to induce them to make concessions to the laboring
</p>
<p>classes, as Mr. Fielden said in his speech on the night of May the 4th. And
</p>
<p>remember, gentlemen of the jury, that it has been testified to by all the
</p>
<p>witnesses who spoke in regard to the speeches and articles of these men,
</p>
<p>that they always made the same argument. Now, Mr. Fielden made the
</p>
<p>:same argument a hundred times before. 'The employers will not like to
</p>
<p>see dissatisfied workingmen in the community, and the laborer can get some
</p>
<p>relief if the employers find that there are dissatisfied workingmen in the
</p>
<p>city.' That was the reason why they told them, 'Arm yourselves and
</p>
<p>organize.' That was the reason why Mr. Spies bragged about the three
</p>
<p>thousand revolutionists and about the bombs ready to be thrown ; that was
</p>
<p>the reason why he told Mr. Wilkinson all about their plans."
</p>
<p>Mr. Zeisler ridiculed the idea that a social revolution was to have been
</p>
<p>inaugurated with the dozens of bombs made by Lingg, and held there had
</p>
<p>been no preparation for it. Coming to the question of conspiracy, he said :
</p>
<p>"What is a conspiracy? What were you used to understand by the
</p>
<p>word conspiracy all your lifetime ? Isn't in the first place secrecy the test
</p>
<p>of a conspiracy ? Was there anything secret about the doings of these

</p>
<p>men, or about their teachings and writings ? When they vented their feel-
</p>
<p>ings at 54 West Lake Street at the meeting of the American group and told
</p>
<p>the people to go to Marshall Field's and Kellogg's, and offered to head the
</p>
<p>procession, told them about their rights, told them to use force, told them
</p>
<p>to arm themselves and to organize, the next morning the daily press of the
</p>
<p>city of Chicago, which reaches five hundred thousand people, and the State's
</p>
<p>Attorney's office, and the Mayor's office, and the office of every authority in
</p>
<p>the city of Chicago, were informed of it."
</p>
<p>The speaker then proceeded to define conspiracy, and said that to con-
</p>
<p>stitute a conspiracy " they must agree with one another to do an unlawful
</p>
<p>act ; one must have communicated the purpose to another, and the others
</p>
<p>must have consented to it." Nothing of this kind had been done. They
</p>
<p>had simply propounded principles and expressed truths from their stand-
</p>
<p>point."
</p>
<p>WAS IT A CONSPIRACY? 539
</p>
<p>" You remember the testimony of Officer Trehorn, who saw the dynamite
</p>
<p>and the caps and the fuse on the night of the inauguration of the Board of
</p>
<p>Trade building, and who the next morning says he went to Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Bedell of the Cottage Grove Avenue Station and told him all about it. If
</p>
<p>that was a conspiracy, and that conspiracy has existed for three years, why
</p>
<p>has the State's Attorney, or his predecessor in office, yet not prosecuted
</p>
<p>those who are parties to that conspiracy? The law of the State of Illinois
</p>
<p>makes it his duty to prosecute every crime which comes to his knowledge.
</p>
<p>He may plead that he has not known of it. If he did not, then it was culp-
</p>
<p>able negligence that he did not know it. If he will answer to you that as
</p>
<p>long as those people did not do any overt act there was no reason for him
</p>
<p>to interfere, then I say as long as these people have not done any overt act
</p>
<p>there was no conspiracy. There is no way of escaping this consequence,
</p>
<p>gentlemen of the jury; to .every logical mind it is clear. Either the State's
</p>
<p>Attorney himself must plead guilty to the charge of the murder of Mathias J.
</p>
<p>Degan, or*every one of these defendants who cannot be shown to have
</p>
<p>actually thrown or lighted the bomb must be acquitted. If it was not con-
</p>
<p>spiracy then, if they had committed a crime up to the 4th of May for which
</p>
<p>it was the duty of the State's Attorney to prosecute them, then what have
</p>
<p>they added to make their doings murder to make them amenable to the
</p>
<p>law on a charge for the highest and gravest offense, the most heinous crime
</p>
<p>known to law?"
</p>
<p>Mr. Zeisler next turned his attention to the special conspiracy entered
</p>
<p>into by a number of persons at No. 54 West Lake Street and held that of
</p>
<p>all the defendants it had only been shown that Engel and Fischer were
</p>
<p>present. He denied that Lingg was there or that any evidence had been
</p>
<p>introduced to prove it. He scored Waller and reviewed some of his testi-
</p>
<p>mony, taking occasion to call the attention of the jury to the fact that the
</p>
<p>man testified that the signal word " Ruhe" was not mentioned in connection
</p>
<p>with the Haymarket meeting. Next he alluded to the places where some
</p>
<p>of the witnesses for the State and some of those present at 54 West Lake
</p>
<p>Street had been on the night of May 4, and spoke of Engel being at home
</p>
<p>enjoying a social glass of beer, and the others widely scattered. " The only
</p>
<p>evidence of a conspiracy was that of Seliger, who testified that Lingg had

<p>asked him if he should throw a bomb. Fischer and others who saw the
</p>
<p>word ' Ruhe' in the Arbeiter-Zeitung did not go to Wicker Park, but went
</p>
<p>elsewhere. What does Waller's testimony say? It says that on the ap-
</p>
<p>pearance of the word ' Ruhe' all should go to their meeting-places in the
</p>
<p>outskirts of the city, and that none of them were to be at the Haymarket
</p>
<p>except the observation committee."
</p>
<p>"Has ' Ruhe' any reference to the Haymarket meeting ? Does it not
</p>
<p>rather show that the parties who conspired there were not to take part in
</p>
<p>the Haymarket meeting at all ? What, then, has the evidence in regard to
</p>
<p>that meeting got to do with the case ? That much (illustrating by snap-
</p>
<p>ping the fingers).
</p>
<p>" Now, to return for a moment to Lingg's alleged attempt to throw a
</p>
<p>bomb. Has there ever been heard such a ridiculous story as that ? It is
</p>
<p>540 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>an absolute falsehood upon its face. A revolutionist, a true disciple of
</p>
<p>Herr Most, goes out with bombs in his pocket, next to his friends, and takes
</p>
<p>a walk, and when he goes to the station and wants to throw a bomb into
</p>
<p>the station he isn't even provided with a light to ignite the fuse; he has to
</p>
<p>ask his friend, ' Have you got a light?' And the other one says he hasn't
</p>
<p>got it or makes some kind of excuse. Don't you see that all that testi-
</p>
<p>mony is given in order to show you, or in order that Mr. Seliger may show
</p>
<p>himself to you as a highly moral person who has been the dupe of Lingg ?
</p>
<p>He, the man who has been an Anarchist for years and years and his wife
</p>
<p>herself says so he has been persuaded by Lingg to make bombs, he has
</p>
<p>been misled by Lingg, has been the dupe of Lingg. Seliger, the man with
</p>
<p>a full beard,* a man of over thirty years, has been the dupe of this innocent-
</p>
<p>looking fellow, Lingg ! If one was the dupe of the other, then Lingg surely
</p>
<p>was the dupe of Seliger. Seliger is the one who was arrested first. In
</p>
<p>order to save his own worthless neck, he betrays his friend and companion
</p>
<p>and swears against him, and upon the testimony of these treacherous lips
</p>
<p>you are asked to convict Lingg."
</p>
<p>Mr. Zeisler maintained that he had shown that there was no conspiracy,
</p>
<p>no general conspiracy, and insisted that the alleged conspiracy of May 3
</p>
<p>had no reference whatever to the Haymarket meeting ; that the throwing of
</p>
<p>the bomb at the Haymarket meeting was in direct contradiction of the
</p>
<p>agreement by the conspirators of May 3, and if one of them had done it,
</p>
<p>he would have done contrary to the conspiracy. He then spoke of the object
</p>
<p>of the Haymarket gathering and said :
</p>
<p>"It was called for the purpose of denouncing the atrocious act of the
</p>
<p>police in shooting down their brethren at the McCormick factory. That
</p>
<p>was the only purpose of the meeting, as Mr. Waller testified. Of course
</p>
<p>his testimony is the one that the State relies upon mostly. Now, what was
</p>
<p>the occasion of calling such a meeting to denounce the act of the police ?
</p>
<p>It was the meeting at McCormick's factory."
</p>
<p>The counsel then reviewed the testimony with reference to the meeting
</p>
<p>near McCormick's factory, pointing to the fact that no one had testified to
</p>
<p>what Spies had actually said on that occasion, and maintained that not a
</p>
<p>single witness had been produced to prove that Spies had then and there

</p>
<p>incited men to riot. Witnesses for the State, he said, had shown that Spies
</p>
<p>continued talking after many of the men had started toward McCormick's
</p>
<p>factory. Did any one suppose he would thus quietly continue speaking
</p>
<p>there if he had precipitated that riot ? Mr. Zeisler did not excuse the men
</p>
<p>for stoning the factory it was wrong but he did not believe that gave
</p>
<p>the right to the police to shoot at those excited people. Coming back to
</p>
<p>the Haymarket, he read some of the testimony on the side of the State to
</p>
<p>show that it was an ordinary, peaceable meeting, and then said that on the
</p>
<p>day Spies wrote the " Revenge " circular Parsons was on his way back from
</p>
<p>Cincinnati and Fielden in a suburban town in a quarry. He next proceeded
</p>
<p>to show that there was no connection with the printing of the " Revenge "
</p>
<p>* Seliger had a full beard at the time of the trial.
</p>
<p>MR. INCH AM' S ARGUMENT. 541
</p>
<p>circular and the Monday night meeting, and said Spies knew nothing
</p>
<p>about the call for that meeting. He closed by saying that the circular
</p>
<p>meant simply the same thing that Fielden and Parsons meant in their
</p>
<p>speeches on the evening of May 4, and that meaning, he said, he had made
</p>
<p>plain in the earlier part of his address.
</p>
<p>MR. GEORGE C. INGHAM, special counsel for the State, followed next.
</p>
<p>His argument was clear, concise and to the point. He opened by citing the
</p>
<p>law in the case, reading numerous authorities with reference to conspiracies
</p>
<p>and commenting thereon at some length. One authority he read was " Rus-
</p>
<p>sell on Crimes," to show that it was simply putting in the shape of a
</p>
<p>statute that which the common law already declares to be an offense, and
</p>
<p>then cited a case which arose not many years ago upon that very statute :
</p>
<p>" Johann Most, in the city of London, was indicted, because while there
</p>
<p>he published a paper advocating the assassination of the crowned heads of
</p>
<p>other countries. He was indicted under that statute, and he was convicted
</p>
<p>by a jury. The case went to their highest court, and I wish now to read
</p>
<p>you what the Justice of that court says as to what is meant by a solicitation
</p>
<p>to murder."
</p>
<p>The opinion of Lord Coleridge was read, and Mr. Ingham continued :
</p>
<p>"You, gentlemen, will remember that that paper (Die Frciheif) is now
</p>
<p>published in the city of New York. The sentence is not given in the report
</p>
<p>I read. The custom is in England that before a sentence is pronounced,
</p>
<p>in case an appeal is taken, that is first passed upon, and after that the
</p>
<p>sentence is pronounced. That case was decided in 1881. Shortly after
</p>
<p>that John Most came to America. They probably thought the best thing
</p>
<p>they could do with him was to pass upon him a light sentence and ship
</p>
<p>him. At any rate they landed him here, and he started his Freiheit paper
</p>
<p>in New York."
</p>
<p>Mr. Ingham next read the case of Cox vs. The People, from the Illinois
</p>
<p>Reports, and continued :
</p>
<p>" Now, apply the law which I have read to the facts of this case. It
</p>
<p>appears in evidence in this case from the documents which I have read to
</p>
<p>you that these men Schwab, Fischer and Parsons were from time to
</p>
<p>time in this city publishing articles printed in papers which they owned, for

</p>
<p>the publishing of which Spies paid, and which they declared to be their own,
</p>
<p>in which they advised the destruction of the police of this city by force, in
</p>
<p>which they advised workingmen from time to time to arm themselves with
</p>
<p>dynamite and be ready whenever a conflict came to destroy the police of
</p>
<p>this city by force. For the publication of any one of those articles, if the
</p>
<p>law had been correctly understood, those men could have been convicted
</p>
<p>and punished for a misdemeanor ; and when on that night Fielden, in the
</p>
<p>presence of the crowd, told the people before him assembled that the war
</p>
<p>had come, that war had been declared, that they must arm themselves to
</p>
<p>resist what he knew never had taken place, he was making a seditious ad-
</p>
<p>dress, and for that reason, if for no other, the police force of this city had a
</p>
<p>right to appear and disperse the meeting.
</p>
<p>542
</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>" Fielden took the stand at the Haymarket, and until he concluded every
</p>
<p>sentence he uttered was a sentence seditious in its character, and which,
</p>
<p>under the decisions of the Supreme Court, would alone subject him to pun-
</p>
<p>ishment for misdemeanor. A trap had been laid Spies laid it ; Schwab
</p>
<p>laid it ; Fischer laid it ; Engel laid it. A trap had been laid to bring out
</p>
<p>the police force of this city, and that trap was baited by the speeches of
</p>
<p>Parsons and Fielden. When the bait grew strong enough, the police did
</p>
<p>come. The moment they got there the moment they stood opposite that
</p>
<p>alley, the moment their marching motion was stopped and they stood in
</p>
<p>that position where the bomb could be thrown with unerring certainty, the
</p>
<p>bomb came.
</p>
<p>"Now, who made that bomb ? You, gentlemen, have heard the evidence
</p>
<p>in this case, which is not disputed. I ask you, gentlemen, to remember that
</p>
<p>so far I have not alluded to a single fact about which there is or can be any
</p>
<p>dispute. It is uncontradicted in this case that Louis Lingg for months had
</p>
<p>_ __ , , been making bombs of a certain construc-
</p>
<p>| tion. It is uncontradicted that on the
</p>
<p>morning of Tuesday Louis Lingg said to
</p>
<p>Seliger that he must work hard all day ;
</p>
<p>that the bombs would be needed and could
</p>
<p>be disposed of before night. It is in evi-
</p>
<p>dence in this case that on that morning
</p>
<p>Louis Lingg left that house and was gone
</p>
<p>all the morning, and nothing has been
</p>
<p>shown as to where he was. It is in evi-
</p>
<p>dence that he came back at noon, and
</p>
<p>because Seliger had filled only one bomb
</p>
<p>and had then laid down on the bed and
</p>
<p>gone to sleep, that Lingg upbraided him
</p>
<p>and told him that this matter must be
</p>
<p>hurried ; and it is in evidence in this case
</p>
<p>that all that afternoon after that time men
</p>
<p>were coming and going to and from that

<p>house and working at that house on those
</p>
<p>bombs. Men came there whom Seliger
</p>
<p>knew ; men came there whom Seliger did
</p>
<p>not know ; men came there whom Mrs. Seliger knew ; men came there
</p>
<p>whom Mrs. Seliger did not know. She tells you that during the whole
</p>
<p>of that day Tuesday men were coming and going to and from that
</p>
<p>house. What for? We put one man on the stand who went to that house
</p>
<p>in the afternoon ^the witness Lehman. Lehman tells you that on Tuesday
</p>
<p>he was working at his trade ; that he quit his work at three o'clock in the
</p>
<p>afternoon, instead of working until the afternoon was over ; that he took
</p>
<p>a fellow-countryman of his, whose name I have forgotten, and with him
</p>
<p>went to Lingg's house to buy a revolver ; that they went to the house and
</p>
<p>dickered first about the revolver, and then went back again, and when he
</p>
<p>went back the second time Louis Lingg gave him dynamite loaded
</p>
<p>bombs, fuse and detonating caps ; that during the day Louis Lingg was dis-
</p>
<p>tributing these bombs to different persons in the city.
</p>
<p>"I want to call your attention to those bombs of Lingg's admitted to
</p>
<p>be his bombs which he admitted to the officers that he himself made, and
</p>
<p>which were found where he had sent them. Every one of those bombs is
</p>

</p>
<p>SILENT WITNESSES. 543
</p>
<p>about three inches in diameter, as nearly as they could be made with the
</p>
<p>rough material which he had. I want to call your attention to this bomb,
</p>
<p>called the ' Czar ' bomb, obtained from Spies. That bomb in its appearance
</p>
<p>is composed of the same sort of material that Lingg's bombs were. You
</p>
<p>can see that the only difference is in the bolts ; that the bolt in the ' Czar '
</p>
<p>bomb was smaller than the bolt in the Lingg bomb. This bolt (exhibiting
</p>
<p>same) would not be large enough to fasten together the three-inch bombs ;
</p>
<p>it would not quite reach through. Now, suppose that Louis Lingg had this
</p>
<p>bolt in his possession and wanted to make a bomb for it, what would he do ?
</p>
<p>He would file off the edges here so as to make its diameter smaller. If you
</p>
<p>will look at this bomb called the 'Czar' bomb, you will see that that is just
</p>
<p>what has been done the edges of it filed off, and it is just in the condition
</p>
<p>it was, with the exception of this scraping here, when the reporter Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son got it. The result of that is that its diameter through here would be
</p>
<p>shorter (indicating) than the diameter across there (indicating). What
</p>
<p>else does that show ? Of course, as this was filed off, it would lessen the
</p>
<p>diameter of the bomb, and when you measure this you will find that that
</p>
<p>only lacks the eighth of an inch of being the same size as the bombs found
</p>
<p>in Lingg's possession. In other words, if that had not been filed off as it
</p>
<p>has been in order that this shorter bolt could be used, these bombs would
</p>
<p>be identical in size.
</p>
<p>" What else is there in evidence in this case in regard to bolts ? Seliger
</p>
<p>tells you that he was sent after bolts that day, that he bought a lot of bolts.
</p>
<p>They have been introduced in evidence. You, gentlemen, noticed it as.
</p>
<p>soon as they were introduced in evidence, that the nut found in the body
</p>
<p>of the Socialist, and which came out of the bomb exploded at the Hay-
</p>
<p>market Square, is identically the same sort of a nut as those found on the
</p>
<p>bombs in Lingg's possession on that day.
</p>
<p>"We have placed on the stand the two most eminent chemists in the
</p>
<p>city of Chicago. Those gentlemen told you that they made examinations
</p>
<p>of pieces of this ' Czar ' bomb which they took from it themselves ; that they
</p>
<p>made examinations of pieces of the four bombs which came from Lingg,
</p>
<p>and that they examined certain articles found in Lingg's possession. And
</p>
<p>what is the result ? They told you that these bombs were not made of lead

</p>
<p>alone ; that they were not lead and solder alone ; that there is not in the
</p>
<p>city of Chicago or known to commerce any one article of which those
</p>
<p>bombs could be made, but that they are made of a mixture not only the
</p>
<p>Lingg bombs, but the 'Czar' bomb. They tell you that three of the Lingg
</p>
<p>bombs and the ' Czar ' bomb contained identically the same constituents,
</p>
<p>without any difference whatever so far as the constituents themselves are
</p>
<p>concerned, and the only difference is that between those bombs there was a
</p>
<p>slight difference in the amount of the tin and the amount of the lead. They
</p>
<p>told you that in the ' Czar ' bomb one per cent, or one and one-tenth per
</p>
<p>cent, is tin ; that in one of the Lingg bombs one and five-tenths per cent,
</p>
<p>was tin ; that in another of them two per cent, was tin. The point of it is-
</p>
<p>this : that every bomb was composed of a mixture and not of any one
</p>
<p>metal ; that the mixture in the bombs was as nearly identical as it could
</p>
<p>be made by any man using the materials which Louis Lingg used, in the
</p>
<p>way in which he used them. You will remember that he told Capt. Schaack
</p>
<p>that he made these bombs with a mold made of clay ; that he could only
</p>
<p>mold one or two bombs, when he had to make a new mold. If you will
</p>
<p>look on the inside of these bombs you will find that they were all made by a
</p>
<p>344 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>rough mold, just as you would expect from one made with a mold of clay ;
</p>
<p>the only difference being that in the case of the 'Czar' bomb it had been
</p>
<p>filed off, as you can see, with a file, in order to smooth it."
</p>
<p>Mr. Ingham then read the testimony of Walter S. Haines, one of the
</p>
<p>chemists, and proceeded :
</p>
<p>" One of these bombs which Louis Lingg admitted that he made dif-
</p>
<p>fered from the others in that it contained a trace of copper. In the trunk
</p>
<p>of Louis Lingg was found this piece of metal, which he had undoubtedly
</p>
<p>used in making that particular bomb, and which accounts for the trace of
</p>
<p>copper in it, the point being that everything found in any one of those
</p>
<p>bombs was found in some shape in Louis Lingg's trunk and possession.
</p>
<p>" The answer to all this is that the bomb, instead of being thrown
</p>
<p>from the alley, was thrown thirty-five feet south of the alley. What of it ?
</p>
<p>What if they have proven that ? What if they have satisfied your minds
</p>
<p>clearly that the bomb came from thirty-five feet south of the alley ? Can
</p>
<p>there be any question in the minds of any reasonable man that he who threw
</p>
<p>that bomb, whether he stood in the alley or thirty-five feet south of the
</p>
<p>alley, was one of the Anarchists associated with these men ?
</p>
<p>" When that question is settled in your minds, that ends this case. We
</p>
<p>ihave proven the conspiracy. It has not been denied. We have proven
</p>
<p>that Degan died from the effects of that bomb ; it has not been denied.
</p>
<p>We have proven it by circumstances making it as clear as the daylight that
</p>
<p>that bomb was thrown by one of the Anarchists, and when we have done
</p>
<p>that we have proven this case when we have done that we have sealed
</p>
<p>the fate of these men, if jurors do their duty under the law as it is written
</p>
<p>and declared.
</p>
<p>" There was a conspiracy. These men know it and have not denied it.
</p>
<p>That bomb came from that conspiracy, and the moment it resulted in the
</p>
<p>death of Degan the crime of conspiracy was merged in the crime of mur-
</p>
<p>der, and every one of these men made amenable under the law.
</p>
<p>" The meeting came ; the crowd did not. The Haymarket was covered
</p>
<p>with little groups of people scattered around. Spies goes around and picks
</p>
<p>out the place for the meeting, and, although he knew that the
</p>
<p>word ' Ruhe ' had been published, although he knew that these armed

<p>groups were scattered all over this city, although he knew that Balthasar
</p>
<p>Rau in an hour could not notify every man who knew of that plan, he him-
</p>
<p>self called it to order in the very place where the police force could be
</p>
<p>massed together and the most enormous destruction done. He told Wil-
</p>
<p>kinson that it was discovered that bombs of composite metals were best, and
</p>
<p>when on that fatal night the bomb was thrown seven men were killed and
</p>
<p>sixty wounded, and to-day in a public hospital of this county, while these
</p>
<p>men sit here decked with flowers, there is one man with eighteen drainage
</p>
<p>tubes in his body. Was Spies right when he said that bombs of composite
</p>
<p>-metal were best ? "

<p>MR. W. A. FOSTER was the next speaker, and he made a very strong
</p>
<p>case for his clients the strongest that could be made in face of
</p>
<p>the many disadvantages under which he labored in view of the evidence
</p>
<p>against the Anarchists. He is a fluent, easy and graceful talker and held
</p>
<p>his facts well in hand. He began in a deliberate manner, and grew at
</p>
<p>times, as he proceeded, quite eloquent in his exposition of the virtues of the
</p>
<p>defendants. He was pointed and caustic sometimes, but he never seemed
</p>
<p>to lose the purpose of making a strong impression on the jury. The open-
</p>
<p>ing of his argument was largely devoted to showing that the Haymarket
</p>
<p>meeting was not riotous or boisterous, but that it had been called for a
</p>
<p>peaceable purpose. Then he said :
</p>
<p>" Take the theory just suggested by the prosecution in this case, that
</p>
<p>the time had come now that was conceived of years and years ago ; the
</p>
<p>time had come now which was suggested by August Spies at Grand Rapids,
</p>
<p>Michigan , the time had come now which was foreseen in conversation had

<p>and various places ; the time had come now when the attack could be made

<p>that was to be incited by the McCormick meeting and the McCormick riot;
</p>
<p>the time had come now when by reason of the gathering of the laboring
</p>
<p>people at the Haymarket Square the attempt was to be made and the
</p>
<p>response was to be made effectual ; now history was to be written, now the
</p>
<p>point had come when bowie knives, when sharpened files poisoned with
</p>
<p>acids, when all of these implements of modern warfare, as we are told, were
</p>
<p>to be turned loose upon the world ; when property rights were to be

</p>
<p>destroyed, when the police were to be killed, when anyone aiding, assisting,
</p>
<p>abetting, standing up for or protecting the law was to be ruthlessly slain.
</p>
<p>The time had come. The men were there, the arrangements had been per-
</p>
<p>fected, the police were in line, halt was made, and they were commanded to
</p>
<p>disperse. The time, the grand culmination of all the arrangements and
</p>
<p>conspiracies and confederations for years back had arrived the time when
</p>
<p>the blow was to be struck which was to overturn civilization, which was to
</p>
<p>overturn the country.
</p>
<p>" These eight men are the leaders, they tell us. They tell us that there
</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>are hundreds more that ought to have been indicted, and should be indicted
</p>
<p>should be prosecuted, and should be convicted, and should be destroyed.
</p>
<p>But the time had come, and the leaders and their friends, having been pre-
</p>
<p>paring for years, were ready. They courted the attack they hailed the
</p>
<p>day. They had pleaded for the opportunity, and the opportunity had now
</p>
<p>arrived. Where are these men ? Where are the men that were to take
</p>
<p>charge and carry on the warfare that had been agreed upon for the last five
</p>
<p>or six years, or longer, in the city of Chicago ? Where were they ? In the
</p>
<p>first place, Mr. Parsons and Mr. Fischer are at Zepf's Hall. Think of it !
</p>
<p>For six long years they had been making their preparations for the attack ;
</p>
<p>for days and weeks and months they had sown and preached revolution ;
</p>
<p>the skirmish lines had met, and they were prepared ; and still Parsons and
</p>
<p>Fischer were quietly discussing matters between themselves over a glass of
</p>
<p>beer at Zepf's Hall. They were principals in this matter, leaders in the
</p>
<p>overthrowing of the Government arid the establishment of this idea. They
</p>
<p>were at Zepf's Hall, away from any scene
</p>
<p>of action. Where is Engel ? Engel, the
</p>
<p>great conspirator Engel, who made the
</p>
<p>inflammatory speeches at Clybourn Ave-
</p>
<p>nue ? Quietly at home, engaged in a game
</p>
<p>of cards with his friend not there at all.
</p>
<p>There is no man that pretends or claims
</p>
<p>that Mr. Engel, at the time the bomb was
</p>
<p>thrown, was at the Haymarket meeting or
</p>
<p>near it.
</p>
<p>" Where was Schwab, one of the brainy
</p>
<p>men of this conspiracy, a man whose pen
</p>
<p>had added to its formation, whose genius
</p>
<p>and whose brain had been instrumental in
</p>
<p>bringing it about ? An hour's ride away,
</p>
<p>at Deering, addressing a quiet meeting of
</p>
<p>laboring men.
</p>
<p>"Where was Neebe ? Neebe, one of
</p>
<p>the leading conspirators, they tell us. He

<p>is one of the eight heads, one of the chiefs
</p>
<p>in the overthrow of the Government and
</p>
<p>of property rights, and he was quietly at home. Lingg, the man who has
</p>
<p>prepared the implements of warfare, the man who has taken the dynamite,
</p>
<p>who has prepared the shells and loaded them, has inserted the caps and
</p>
<p>the fuse and made all the preparations for the destruction of the police, for
</p>
<p>the destruction of the militia and for the destruction of property every-
</p>
<p>where where is Lingg? Wandering about upon Larrabee Street, in the
</p>
<p>neighborhood of Clybourn Avenue.
</p>
<p>" Where is Spies and where is Fielden ? Spies and Fielden, the only
</p>
<p>remaining ones of the eight, are upon the wagon, in the presence of line
</p>
<p>after line of the police, armed to the teeth, having not only the regulation
</p>
<p>revolvers in their coat-pockets, but those of larger caliber, in some instances, '
</p>
<p>so far as some of the companies were concerned, in their belts. Those men
</p>
<p>were quietly standing upon the wagon, right in sight and within the aim of
</p>
<p>all of these murderous weapons, with the idea that an attack was to be made,
</p>
<p>with the idea and knowledge that an assault was to take place, with the
</p>
<p>idea and the knowledge that now the final blow was to strike which should

</p>
<p>carry terror to the hearts of the capitalists and overturn society and gov-
</p>
<p>ernment. They were there, quietly arguing, arguing with the police in com-
</p>
<p>mand there, that the meeting was peaceable.
</p>
<p>" But they say, gentlemen, ' Ruhe ' is a German word and means peace,
</p>
<p>quiet, rest ; that because it means quiet, therefore this is what they intend
</p>
<p>to have you believe that because Fielden said, 'This is a quiet meeting,'
</p>
<p>or that it was peaceable, or, ' We are peaceable,' that that was the watch-
</p>
<p>word which was to be an order in cipher to commence immediately an attack.
</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen, I say that this is, in my opinion, an unfair deduction ; it is
</p>
<p>an unfair conclusion. The testimony all agrees that Captain Ward appeared
</p>
<p>there and said : ' In the name of the people of the State of Illinois, I com-
</p>
<p>mand you to quietly and peaceably disperse.' That was the expression ' I
</p>
<p>command you to peaceably disperse ' to which Mr. Fielden replied : ' We
</p>
<p>are peaceable,' or 'This is a peaceable meeting, Captain.' Could anything
</p>
<p>be more natural than that that reply should be made ? Suppose, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, now, that the theory of the prosecution is right ; suppose that it was
</p>
<p>the grand beginning of an uncertain end ; suppose that it was the culmina-
</p>
<p>tion of the idea that had existed for years. Do you believe that bombs
</p>
<p>would not have hailed from the top of every building ? Do you believe they
</p>
<p>would not have been thrown from every sidewalk ? Do you suppose they
</p>
<p>would not have been thrown from the rear and from the front ? In the
</p>
<p>nature of things, can you, in the light of this testimony, say that because
</p>
<p>some man somewhere, on account of some reason, which is not explained
</p>
<p>here, which never can be explained, acting upon his own individual respon-
</p>
<p>sibility, lighted a bomb and threw it, that therefore you must say that the
</p>
<p>grand conspiracy, the arrangement for years and years had this result, or
</p>
<p>rather that the throwing of that bomb was the result of that conspiracy ?
</p>
<p>"But there is one thing the gentlemen have lost sight of in this case, it
</p>
<p>seems tome. Of course they haven't, but in their argument they have care-
</p>
<p>fully avoided it. A Socialist is not to be believed, a Communist is a liar, and
</p>
<p>an Anarchist is capable of committing any crime. That is what they tell
</p>
<p>us in plain language that we have produced some witnesses here who are
</p>
<p>Socialists, Communists and Anarchists, and because we have done so, their
</p>
<p>testimony, for that reason alone, is to be discarded. Mr. Walker and Mr.

</p>
<p>Ingham both made reference to the character of some of our witnesses upon
</p>
<p>the theory and upon the ground that the evidence showed that they were
</p>
<p>Anarchists or Communists. Well, they were Anarchists, Socialists and
</p>
<p>Communists, some of them.
</p>
<p>" Although the gentlemen claim that a conviction might exist, leaving
</p>
<p>out the testimony of Gilmer and of Thompson, they would never concede
</p>
<p>that under any circumstances a conviction could be had were it not for the
</p>
<p>testimony of Seliger and the testimony of Waller ; they never would con-
</p>
<p>cede that, and did the gentlemen ever think, while they were presenting to
</p>
<p>you the case upon which they demanded a conviction, that the very wit-
</p>
<p>nesses that they proved the facts by upon which they ask you to hang
</p>
<p>these men are Socialists and Communists and Anarchists ?
</p>
<p>" Not only, then, are Waller and Seliger Communists, Socialists and
</p>
<p>Anarchists, but they are State's witnesses, co-confederates and conspirators,
</p>
<p>men whose testimony is regarded with disfavor and with suspicion by
</p>
<p>the law.
</p>
<p>" They tell us that a man will lie to save his life. Said Mr. W T alker,
</p>
<p>' Do you believe Mr. Spies ? Will he not lie to save his life ? ' Then I
</p>
<p>548 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>retort the argument of the gentleman upon his own head and say, ' Would
</p>
<p>not Seliger lie to save his own neck ?'
</p>
<p>"They take Mr. Seliger down and they examine him and they get his
</p>
<p>statement and they reduce it to writing. The detective force is turned
</p>
<p>loose upon him. His statement is not strong enough; that won't do; it is
</p>
<p>not enough ; still there are missing links. ' Mr. Seliger, this statement
</p>
<p>won't do; we want something stronger than that.' I can imagine I am
</p>
<p>not giving the testimony now, but I can imagine how those detectives
</p>
<p>would go to Seliger, carried away from his family as he was, shut up in a
</p>
<p>dark dungeon, kept there day after day ' Now, Seliger, here are two pro-
</p>
<p>positions : here is a rope and here is a statement; choose between them.'
</p>
<p>He chose the lesser of the two evils the statement, as any man would,
</p>
<p>Mr. Walker says, to save his own life. He makes the statement. He
</p>
<p>goes away. I can imagine, I say, the conduct and the actions of the detec-
</p>
<p>tive force as they ply him with questions from day to day. ' It won't do,
</p>
<p>Mr. Seliger, it won't do. There are too many missing links. We want
</p>
<p>something more. Isn't this so, isn't that so? Didn't this happen, didn't
</p>
<p>that happen?' And poor Seliger, frightened, weak-minded and timid,
</p>
<p>ignorant of the laws of this country, ignorant of the rights which American
</p>
<p>citizens have under the laws, sits down and makes the second statement.
</p>
<p>And still the thing goes on, still he is kept in confinement, still he is plied
</p>
<p>with questions, still he is examined and cross-examined : ' Mr. Seliger, the
</p>
<p>first statement won't do, and the second statement won't do. Mr. Seliger,
</p>
<p>we want more from you than this.' And, says Mr. Walker, 'Won't a man
</p>
<p>lie to save his life?' And Mr. Seliger makes the third statement, and
</p>
<p>again he goes back to his dungeon, and after a while again they go to Seli-
</p>
<p>ger and they say to Seliger, 'This won't do. You have made a statement,
</p>
<p>you have made a second statement, you have made a third statement, but
</p>
<p>still there are missing links. Isn't this so, isn't that so?' And, as Mr.
</p>
<p>Walker says, ' Won't any man lie to save his life ? ' And the fourth state-
</p>
<p>ment is made by Seliger. And these statements are unrolled as he sits
</p>
<p>here quivering and trembling, knowing perhaps that he is destroying the
</p>
<p>lives of these eight men, his former friends and associates, and questions
</p>
<p>are pronounced after questions, and the testimony is introduced before you,

<p>gentlemen, from a Socialist, from a Communist, from an Anarchist, from a
</p>
<p>conspirator, and from a man that will lie to save his own life ; and upon
</p>
<p>that testimony you are to act, and you are not to act upon any testimony
</p>
<p>introduced by the defendants in this case.
</p>
<p>"You remember the candy-maker that was brought upon the stand by
</p>
<p>the merest accident. You remember the circumstance that when his
</p>
<p>name was called he responded from that corner of the room (indicating)
</p>
<p>none of us had ever seen him ; we didn't know it, and I don't to-day
</p>
<p>hardly know how we got any information in regard to the man at all. And
</p>
<p>when he came forward here you will remember that this case was delayed
</p>
<p>until Mr. Zeisler and myself took him into the other room to ascertain if
</p>
<p>possible why he was here and to what facts he was going to testify. He
</p>
<p>came upon the stand, and what does he tell you ? He tells you that on the
</p>
<p>night of the 4th of May he was at the Haymarket. He tells you that he was
</p>
<p>south of the alley, and when it was rumored there that the police were com-
</p>
<p>ing he started with others down. He tells you that at the time he did not
</p>
<p>know how far it was south of the alley, but he knows from the location and
</p>
<p>from the surroundings, and that since then he has gone there with his
</p>
<p>THE CANDY-MAN AND GILMER. 549
</p>
<p>tape-line and he has measured it, and that it is thirty-eight feet south of the
</p>
<p>south line of Crane's alley. He tells you that as they were going down,
</p>
<p>when the police had come up he saw a man with this motion, indicating a
</p>
<p>backward and upward motion with the right hand not with this motion that
</p>
<p>Frank Walker tells about cast a burning fuse, as it went hissing through
</p>
<p>the air ; that he followed it until it struck, that he looked at it until the
</p>
<p>whole country around about was illuminated by the explosion and police-
</p>
<p>men bit the dust.
</p>
<p>" Is he a reliable man, gentlemen ? Is there anything wrong in his
</p>
<p>character ? If there was, why, as late as two weeks before the time that he
</p>
<p>testified, was Mr. Furthmann placing before him the picture of Rudolph
</p>
<p>Schnaubelt ? If he was an unreliable man and they knew it, if they did not
</p>
<p>believe his statement because of his unreliability, why, I say, was Mr. Furth-
</p>
<p>mann two weeks before according to the testimony of the witness
</p>
<p>which Mr. Furthmann has not undertaken to gainsay or deny present-
</p>
<p>ing the photograph of Rudolph Schnaubelt to see whether he could identify
</p>
<p>that man as being the man who threw the bomb ? If he was an unreliable
</p>
<p>man, he tells us where he has worked ; he tells us where he has lived ; he
</p>
<p>tells us who his associates are ; he tells us all about it. If there is anything
</p>
<p>wrong, then Captain Schaack would turn loose his detectives and his police
</p>
<p>and in less than an hour's time the character, the true character, the villain-
</p>
<p>ous character of the man would have been exhibited before you. But
</p>
<p>nothing of that kind is done. They ascertain the fact that he saw the
</p>
<p>bomb-thrower they know that he saw the bomb-thrower at least, they
</p>
<p>believe that he saw the bomb-thrower, and the question is, Who shall be
</p>
<p>used? Shall the candy-maker be used, or shall Gilmer be used? Which
</p>
<p>shall it be the candy-man or Gilmer?
</p>
<p>" Now, you will remember that the State was two weeks putting in their
</p>
<p>testimony, and you will remember that the defense was one week a week
</p>
<p>and one day more. You will remember the testimony of this witness was that
</p>
<p>two weeks before that time, which was one week after the State began to in-
</p>
<p>troduce their testimony, Mr. Furthmann presented before his face the
</p>
<p>picture of Rudolph Schnaubelt and demanded to know whether he could
</p>
<p>recognize the picture as being the man who threw the tjomb. I say then it

</p>
<p>seems, Mr. Gilmer to the contrary notwithstanding, that a week after they
</p>
<p>had commenced the introduction of their testimony it was still a doubtful,
</p>
<p>uncertain and mooted question as to where took place the throwing of that
</p>
<p>bomb, and into whose hands to place it.
</p>
<p>" What does the candy-maker say? He says honestly to Mr. Furth-
</p>
<p>mann : ' I cannot recognize that man as being the man ; I don't believe that
</p>
<p>that man had whiskers ; all I know is that I think he had a light mustache
</p>
<p>and I think he was an ordinary-sized man ; that is all I know about him.'.
</p>
<p>"And, gentlemen, that is a reasonable story. Hurrying away as he was
</p>
<p>in that crowd, supposing that the police had come there for a purpose, see-
</p>
<p>ing this thing take place and the disaster that resulted from it and the
</p>
<p>excitement incident to it, would we expect that he would know or would be
</p>
<p>able to see any more than that ? He did not recognize Schnaubelt as being
</p>
<p>the man ; he did not recognize Fischer as being present at the time the
</p>
<p>bomb was thrown ; he did not recognize Spies as being the man who lighted
</p>
<p>the fuse, and the prosecution did not want him, and so they sent him back
</p>
<p>to the candy-shop in obscurity, and there intended that he should remain.
</p>
<p>They did not want him. Why didn't they ? They had found a conspiracy,
</p>
<p>5 50 ANAR CHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>they say, to use violence for certain illegal purposes. They had established
</p>
<p>the fact of murder ; there was a missing link ; that was what was troubling
</p>
<p>them, and that is what has troubled them from the beginning of this trial
</p>
<p>down to the present time the missing link. Where is the man in all the
</p>
<p>face of God's green earth, where is the man that can identify one of these
</p>
<p>men that we will show was in any conspiracy to do anything which we
</p>
<p>might criticise or object to, that is in any way responsible for what was done
</p>
<p>at the Haymarket that night ? They must have the missing link, or else
</p>
<p>they must fail in this prosecution. The candy-man won't furnish it. He
</p>
<p>tells his story, a consistent and reasonable story. They believe his story
</p>
<p>because they take him up and they exhibit to him the picture ' Is that
</p>
<p>the man ? ' Oh, if he had only said, ' Yes, that is the man, that is the man.
</p>
<p>that was in company with him,' how quickly the candy-maker would have
</p>
<p>come before us as a witness. But no ; the man said honestly, ' I cannot do
</p>
<p>that ; I was in a crowd in the darkness ; I was in the bustle and the excite-
</p>
<p>ment ; I cannot do that.' They didn't want him ; they sent him home.
</p>
<p>And still there is a missing link. Who is going to furnish it ?
</p>
<p>" Gilmer comes proudly to the front. He says, 'Rather than have the
</p>
<p>play stopped I will furnish the missing link.' Gilmer Harry L. Gilmer
</p>
<p>the old soldier that they tell us about. I don't believe it. I don't be-
</p>
<p>lieve he was ever in the army a day of his life, because I believe if he had
</p>
<p>been that my brother Grinnell, of all witnesses that had been called, would
</p>
<p>have asked him that very first question. Some of you gentlemen bear upon
</p>
<p>your breasts the emblem of the Grand Army of the Republic ; some of you
</p>
<p>were in the war and marched at the peril of your lives under the stars and
</p>
<p>stripes, and you would delight in meeting a man, and delight in believing
</p>
<p>in his honor and integrity, if you believed that he was engaged in the com-
</p>
<p>mon cause with you in those trying days ; and still the shrewd counsel never
</p>
<p>asked the question. A veteran ! Yes, a veteran of Battery D, a veteran
</p>
<p>of Chicago, of the Home Rangers, a man that never smelt burnt powder in
</p>
<p>his life perhaps he is the veteran soldier that is lauded before you gentle-
</p>
<p>men in the argument of counsel who have addressed you on the part of the
</p>
<p>prosecution in this case.

</p>
<p>has given to the world three of the grandest, the most consummate and
</p>
<p>infernal liars that ever existed since Adam first was set in the Garden of
</p>
<p>Eden three names prominently that we find in the history that we are
</p>
<p>making now, in modern history and in ancient, and in importance they
</p>
<p>stand in the order in which I name them. First of all, greater than all,
</p>
<p>above them all in infamy and falsehood, is Harry L. Gilmer ; next to him
</p>
<p>comes M. M. Thompson, and third is Ananias of old, whose Christian name
</p>
<p>I never heard, if, in fact, he ever had one. All history, ransacked, will fur-
</p>
<p>nish no three such men as the three names that I have suggested."
</p>
<p>Mr. Foster then adverted to some points in the management of the case,
</p>
<p>and touched at some length on the fact that Gilmer had not testified before
</p>
<p>the grand jury. He proceeded as follows :
</p>
<p>"Of all the testimony that has been introduced here, the testimony of
</p>
<p>Harry Gilmer is paramount. Bind the rest of it together in a sheaf, set it
</p>
<p>alongside of the testimony of Harry Gilmer, and it is as a molehill compared
</p>
<p>to a mountain, if the testimony of Harry Gilmer is true. If the testimony
</p>
<p>WITNESS GILMER ARRAIGNED. 551
</p>
<p>of Harry Gilmer is true, August Spies and Mr. Fischer must die. If you
</p>
<p>believe him, they must be swept from the face of the earth ; and yet Mr.
</p>
<p>Grinnell, saying, ' We have nothing to conceal and nothing to hide ; ' forgets
</p>
<p>to tell you that he has the man who saw Mr. Spies, in the presence of Mr.
</p>
<p>Fischer, light the fuse which was thrown by Mr. Schnaubelt, and which
</p>
<p>destroyed Officer Degan. He never expected to prove it. If he did if it
</p>
<p>is true that he expected to, and if it is true that he had nothing to conceal
</p>
<p>and nothing to hide, why, then, didn't he say it ? Why had it not been
</p>
<p>published broadcast to the land by these newspaper gentlemen ? Why was
</p>
<p>it that Harry Gilmer's face was not published and sent forth in every paper
</p>
<p>that is published in the land ? Why was it that it was not said : ' This is
</p>
<p>the man this is the man who has the testimony within his knowledge
</p>
<p>which will show the connection and establish the link which fastens some of
</p>
<p>the defendants, at least, to the murder of Mathias J. Degan ? ' Not a word
</p>
<p>not a word upon the subject of Harry L. Gilmer, the veteran of the war,
</p>
<p>the old soldier, so eloquently discoursed upon by my brother Walker.
</p>
<p>Where was Gilmer then ?
</p>
<p>" I can imagine brother Grinnell, in his anxiety and his quandary in
</p>
<p>determining what course to pursue here, discussing with himself and his
</p>
<p>associates as to whether or not this case should be determined upon the
</p>
<p>testimony of Thompson alone, or Thompson and Gilmer mixed. It has
</p>
<p>been a serious consideration on the part of the gentlemen. There can't be
</p>
<p>any doubt about that. But the honest man who says, ' No, I can't identify
</p>
<p>them,' is sent home, and Harry Gilmer is brought to the front. He will
</p>
<p>identify Schnaubelt oh, yes ; no question about that. He will do more
</p>
<p>than that ; he will identify Fischer oh, yes ; he will do more than that.
</p>
<p>Fischer may prove an alibi ; they do not know whether Fischer was there,
</p>
<p>but there is one man that they do know was there, and that he was there
</p>
<p>all that time upon that wagon, and that was August Spies, and, if necessary,
</p>
<p>Harry Gilmer will identify Spies. Now, do you believe that, gentlemen ?
</p>
<p>Do you believe that? And I do not charge my brother Grinnell with put-
</p>
<p>ting Harry Gilmer upon the stand knowing that he was swearing to a pack
</p>
<p>of lies. Not at all ; I do not charge him with that. I charge him with
</p>
<p>placing no reliance upon the man at all. I say that, if Mr. Grinnell knew

</p>
<p>at the time he made his opening statement that Harry Gilmer was to come
</p>
<p>upon the stand and swear to that fact, he did not do his duty as a lawyer
</p>
<p>and he did not keep his pledge to the jury, and if he did not know it, it

<p>" Now, I say to you, gentlemen, from all the surrounding circumstances
</p>
<p>in this case I say that Harry L. Gilmer and I stated to you the other
</p>
<p>day that I was not in the habit of calling witnesses liars ; I preferred to pre-
</p>
<p>sent their testimony under the suspicion of mistake rather than the sus-
</p>
<p>picion of falsehood but I say as to Harry L. Gilmer that he is a stupen-
</p>
<p>dous, colossal, a monumental liar, and there is no escape from it. Now,
</p>
<p>just think of it for a moment. The world was excited; every daily paper in
</p>
<p>the universe published accounts in Paris and in London, in Petersburg
</p>
<p>and Vienna, on the morning following the 4th of May, citizens read of
</p>
<p>the disaster of the Haymarket; the civilized world was shocked with the
</p>
<p>outrage that was perpetrated there. Where was Harry Gilmer, the man
</p>
<p>who could identify the man who threw the bomb, the man who could
</p>
<p>identify his companion, and the man who could identify the person who lit
</p>
<p>the fuse ? Where was Harry Gilmer on the 5th day of May ? He tells us
</p>
<p>552 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>he was in Crane's alley the night of the 4th ; he was there in the alley ; he
</p>
<p>saw Spies ; he says, ' That is the man right over there ; that is the man
</p>
<p>that threw it ; ' he saw that man right over there Spies strike a match and
</p>
<p>light the fuse, and saw Fischer in his company. Schnaubelt threw it in the
</p>
<p>ranks of the policemen.
</p>
<p>" There is the missing link, and if you believe that testimony as to two
</p>
<p>of these defendants, the chain is complete. Darwin is dead, but the missing
</p>
<p>link has been found. The man who furnished the missing link went home.
</p>
<p>The man that has seen this meandered through Crane's alley and went
</p>
<p>quietly home to his roost, and he went to bed undisturbed. It is true he
</p>
<p>had seen the man who threw the bomb ;' he would know him anywhere.
</p>
<p>He would know him by his picture ; he knows how many buttons of his coat
</p>
<p>were buttoned. He saw the man that stood by. He would know him any-
</p>
<p>where. He knows what kind of clothing he had on and how many buttons
</p>
<p>he had buttoned of his- clothes. He knew the kind of hat, the kind of
</p>
<p>clothes. He knew the man who lit the match, who touched the fuse that
</p>
<p>exploded the bomb that Schnaubelt threw. He knew him. He knew
</p>
<p>whether his coat was buttoned and how many buttons. He knew all about
</p>
<p>it everything that every man in the universe demanded should be known
</p>
<p>by the officers of the law. And he went home and went to bed and never
</p>
<p>said a word to any living soul about it. And he got up in the morning,
</p>
<p>fresh upon his mind the fact of this great outrage that was perpetrated and
</p>
<p>that everybody was talking about everywhere in restaurants, on the street
</p>
<p>and in street-cars knowing that he was the man that could recognize
</p>
<p>them all he goes and buys a paper on the street and sits down to read
</p>
<p>how terrible it was, goes into a restaurant and there sits, where men were
</p>
<p>conversing of the horror and of the outrage, and never opens his head in
</p>
<p>regard to knowing anything about it not a word. Then he goes, after he
</p>
<p>has had his 'meal,' and gets upon the car goes to the corner of Twenty-
</p>
<p>second Street and Wabash Avenue, and there he meets a friend, a brother
</p>
<p>painter, and they work all day, and from a third to half the time, as he states,
</p>
<p>they were painting together and lapping each other's brushes as they
</p>
<p>painted upon the side of the building, and when noon came they sat down
</p>
<p>to discuss matters and talk, over their lunch. They speak, at times, about

<p>the Haymarket meeting and the great disaster, and he never tells his friend
</p>
<p>that he had seen the bomb thrown, or knew anything about it not a word.
</p>
<p>The world was in flames, but Harry Gilmer was cool."
</p>
<p>Mr. Foster continued his attention to Gilmer at considerable length,
</p>
<p>making, however, no new points against him, and then proceeded :
</p>
<p>"Now, Mr. Graham is not a Socialist. He is not a Communist nor an
</p>
<p>Anarchist. He is a reporter, and I say that he is an honorable man. His
</p>
<p>bearing showed it ; his countenance indicated it ; and the fact that he is
</p>
<p>not attacked nor impeached, nor one word said against him, either in argu-
</p>
<p>ment or in testimony, in my mind establishes it.
</p>
<p>" Well, that didn't amount to very much. There are always knowing
</p>
<p>ones around, and Gilmer was one of them. He liked to loaf about police
</p>
<p>stations. He remembered the time when he was collecting the dog tax in
</p>
<p>Des Moines. He associated with men that wore uniforms, and he liked it.
</p>
<p>He wanted to ingratiate himself into their good opinions, and he says : ' 1
</p>
<p>believe I would know the fellow. I was there. I was right in plain sight,
</p>
<p>and I saw him light the fuse and I saw him toss the bomb. His back was
</p>

</p>
<p>553
</p>
<p>to me, it is true, but I do believe I would know him.' Ah ! where was
</p>
<p>Fischer then ? Where was ' that man sitting over there,' as Gilmer expresses
</p>
<p>it ? Where was Spies and where was Fischer then ? Well, they hadn't
</p>
<p>developed at that stage of the proceeding, that is all. They were the after-
</p>
<p>birth in his testimony."
</p>
<p>Mr. Foster went into a long and searching examination of the evidence,
</p>
<p>arguing out the more important facts developed, and closing with an elo-
</p>
<p>quent appeal to the sympathies of the jury. His speech was effective and
</p>
<p>impressive.
</p>
<p>On the next morning- Tuesday Capt. Black began his argument for
</p>
<p>the defense, and was listened to by the jury with marked attention. He is
</p>
<p>a forcible speaker and dwelt upon the testimony favorable to his side with
</p>
<p>earnestness and emphasis. He traversed necessarily a good deal of the
</p>
<p>ground covered by his colleagues, but he clothed his argument in captivat-
</p>
<p>ing language, and made a striking and effective appeal for his clients.
</p>
<p>The following will show the points he made :
</p>
<p>"On the morning of the 5th of May, 1886, the good people of the city
</p>
<p>of Chicago were startled and shocked at the event of the previous night,
</p>
<p>frightened, many of them, not knowing whereunto this thing might lead.
</p>
<p>Fear is the father of cruelty. It was no ordinary case. Immediately after
</p>
<p>that first emotion came a feeling which has found expression from many
</p>
<p>lips in the hearing of many, if not all of you : ' A great wrong has been
</p>
<p>done ; somebody must be punished, somebody ought to suffer for the suffer-
</p>
<p>ing which has been wrought.' Perhaps it was that feeling I know not
</p>
<p>which led to the unusual and extraordinary proceedings which were taken in
</p>
<p>connection with this matter immediately following the 4th of May. Per-
</p>
<p>haps it was that feeling, in a large measure, which led to the arrest and
</p>
<p>presentment of these eight defendants. Perhaps it was something of that
</p>
<p>feeling which will explain the conduct of the prosecution in this case. I
</p>
<p>am not disposed to say that there has been any willful or deliberate intent
</p>
<p>on the part of the representatives of the State to act unfairly. I am not
</p>
<p>disposed to charge that there has been upon their part any disposition to
</p>
<p>do an injustice to any man. But in their case, as in the case of all, passion

</p>
<p>perverts the heart, prejudice corrupts the judgment.
</p>
<p>" On the night of the 4th of May a dynamite bomb was thrown in the
</p>
<p>city of Chicago and exploded. It was the first time that in our immediate
</p>
<p>civilization, and immediately about us, this great destructive agency was
</p>
<p>used in modern contests. I beg you to remember, in the consideration of
</p>
<p>this case, that dynamite is not the invention of Socialists ; it is not their
</p>
<p>discovery. Science has turned it loose upon the world an agency of
</p>
<p>destruction, whether for defense or offense, whether for attack or to build
</p>
<p>the bulwarks round the beleaguered city. It has entered into modern war-
</p>
<p>fare. We know from what has already transpired in this case that dyna-
</p>
<p>mite is being experimented with as a weapon of warfare by the great nations
</p>
<p>of the world. What has been read in your hearing has given you the
</p>
<p>results of experiments made under the direction of the Government of Aus-
</p>
<p>tria, and while you have sat in this jury-box considering the things which
</p>
<p>have been deposed before you, with reference to reaching a final and cor-
</p>
<p>rect result, the Government of the United States has voted $350,000 for the
</p>

</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>building of a dynamite cruiser. It is in the world by no procurement of
</p>
<p>Socialism, with no necessary relationship thereto. It is in the world to
</p>
<p>stay. It is manufactured freely ; it is sold without let, hindrance or restric-
</p>
<p>tion. You may go from this jury-box to the leading powder companies of
</p>
<p>the country, or their depots, and buy all the dynamite that you wish with-
</p>
<p>out question as to your purpose, without interrogation as to your motive.
</p>
<p>It is here. Is it necessarily a thing of evil? It has entered into the great
</p>
<p>industries, and we know its results. It has cleared the path of commerce
</p>
<p>where the great North River rolls on its way to the sea. It is here and
</p>
<p>there blasting out rocks, digging out mines, and used for helpfulness in the
</p>
<p>great industries of life. But there never came an explosive into the world,
</p>
<p>cheap, simple of construction, easy of manufacture, that it did not enter
</p>
<p>also into the world's combats. I beg
</p>
<p>you to remember also that hand-bombs
</p>
<p>are not things of Socialistic devising.
</p>
<p>It may be that one or another, here and
</p>
<p>there, professing Socialistic tenets, has
</p>
<p>devised some improvements in their
</p>
<p>construction, or has made some ad-
</p>
<p>vances with reference to their composi-
</p>
<p>tion ; they have not invented them. The
</p>
<p>hand-grenade has been known in war-
</p>
<p>fare long ere you and I saw the light.
</p>
<p>The two things have come together
</p>
<p>the hand-grenade, charged no longer
</p>
<p>with the powder of old days, but charged
</p>
<p>with the dynamite of modern science.
</p>
<p>It is a union which Socialists are not
</p>
<p>responsible for. It is a union led up
</p>
<p>to by the logic of events and the neces-
</p>
<p>sities of situations, and it is a union that
</p>
<p>will never be divorced. We stand amaz-
</p>
<p>ed at the dread results that are possible

<p>to this union ; but as we look back over
</p>
<p>history we know this fact, contradictory
</p>
<p>as it may seem, strange as it may first
</p>
<p>strike us, that in the exact proportion
</p>
<p>in which the implements of warfare have been made effective or destruct-
</p>
<p>ive, in that precise proportion have wars lost the utmost measure of
</p>
<p>their horror, and in that precise proportion has death by war diminished.
</p>
<p>When gunpowder came into European warfare there was an outcry against
</p>
<p>it. All the chivalry which had arrogated to itself the power and glory of
</p>
<p>battle in martial times sprang up against the introduction of gunpowder, an
</p>
<p>agency that made the iron casque and shield and cuirass of the plumed
</p>
<p>knight no better a defense than the hemp doublet of the peasant. But now,
</p>
<p>instead of wars that last through thirty years, that are determined by the
</p>
<p>personal collision of individuals, that desolate nations, the great civilized
</p>
<p>nations of the world hesitate at war because of its possibilities of evil, and
</p>
<p>diplomacy sits where once force alone was intrenched. The moral respon-
</p>
<p>sibility for dynamite is not upon Socialism."
</p>
<p>Captain Black insisted that the sole question before the jury was who
</p>
<p>threw the bomb, for the doctrine of accessory before the fact, under which
</p>

</p>
<p>it was sought to hold the defendants, was nothing but the application to the
</p>
<p>criminal law of the civil or common law doctrine that what a man does by
</p>
<p>another he does himself. When the prosecution charged that the defend-
</p>
<p>ants threw it, their charge involved that the bomb was thrown by the pro-
</p>
<p>curement of these men, by their advice, direction, aid, counsel or encour-
</p>
<p>agement, and that the man who threw it acted not alone for himself, or upon
</p>
<p>his own responsibility, but as a result of the encouragement or procurement
</p>
<p>of these men. He held that the State must show that the agent of the
</p>
<p>defendants did the deed, and that it is not sufficient to show that the
</p>
<p>defendants favored such deeds. Upon this point counsel spoke at some
</p>
<p>length. Next he took up the case of one of the talesmen examined with
</p>
<p>reference to his taking a place on the jury, who swore that, having been for
</p>
<p>three years connected with the office of the Prosecuting Attorney in the
</p>
<p>State of New York, he found in himself that the habit of thought and life
</p>
<p>to which he had there devoted himself had created in him a predisposition
</p>
<p>to believe every accused man guilty, which, in his own deliberate judgment
</p>
<p>before God, disqualified him from sitting as an impartial juror in a criminal
</p>
<p>case. The application of this case to the attaches of the State's Attorney's
</p>
<p>office who had appeared before the jury' was made the most of.
</p>
<p>After going over the evidence as to the other conspirators Capt. Black
</p>
<p>came to the case against Fischer and Engel. He said :
</p>
<p>"It is perhaps proper that, in view of the circumstance that Fischer and
</p>
<p>Engel were the only two defendants at the West Lake Street meeting on
</p>
<p>Monday night, I should present briefly my opinions touching that meeting
</p>
<p>as relating to this case. Two witnesses, Waller and Schrade, testified as
</p>
<p>to what occurred at that meeting. Waller said there were seventy or
</p>
<p>eighty people present ; the other placed the attendance at thirty-five to
</p>
<p>forty. Let us suppose thirty-five or forty met together in that basement.
</p>
<p>In the progress of the meeting it transpired that there had been a meeting
</p>
<p>of the North Side group, of which Mr. Engel was a member, on the previ-
</p>
<p>ous morning (Sunday). At that meeting a resolution was adopted, which
</p>
<p>was brought before the Monday night meeting for consideration, and it was
</p>
<p>adopted in the manner indicated by Waller. I think I state it fairly to the
</p>
<p>State and fairly to the defendants themselves, when I say that the action

</p>
<p>then and there resolved upon was this, no more, no less : That if in the
</p>
<p>event of a struggle the police should attempt by brute force to overpower
</p>
<p>the strikers unlawfully and unjustly, those men would lend their help to
</p>
<p>their fellow-wageworkers as against the police. A plan of action was sug-
</p>
<p>gested by one of the group which contemplated the blowing up of police
</p>
<p>stations, cutting telegraph wires and disabling the Fire Department. Every
</p>
<p>particle of that resolution, gentlemen, was expressly dependent upon the
</p>
<p>unlawful invasion of the rights of the working people by the police. Noth-
</p>
<p>ing was to be inaugurated by the so-called conspirators, there was to be no
</p>
<p>resort to force by them in the first instance. It was solely defensive, and
</p>
<p>had reference alone to meeting force by force ; it had reference alone to a
</p>
<p>possible attack in the future, dependent upon the action that the police
</p>
<p>themselves might take. I am not here to defend the action of that meet-
</p>
<p>556 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>ing. The question here is : Had that action anything whatever to do with
</p>
<p>the result of the Haymarket meeting ? The action of the North Side group
</p>
<p>had nothing to do with that, since the Haymarket meeting had never been
</p>
<p>dreamed of or suggested at that time. By whom was the Tuesday meeting
</p>
<p>suggested ? What was its scope, purpose and object ? As then and there
</p>
<p>declared, it was simply to be a mass-meeting of workingmen with reference
</p>
<p>to police outrages that had already taken place. Were the armed men,
</p>
<p>those conspirators who met at West Lake Street, present ? ' No ; they
</p>
<p>were not there.' That is the testimony of Waller and Schrade. I am not
</p>
<p>here even to say that the proposition to call that meeting was a wise one.
</p>
<p>The event has proven how sadly unwise it was. But I am here to say that
</p>
<p>the men who in that Monday night meeting proposed the calling of the
</p>
<p>Tuesday night meeting, if we take the testimony of the State itself, had no
</p>
<p>dream or expectation of violence, difficulty or contest on that eventful night.
</p>
<p>But before the Tuesday night meeting was proposed, a suggestion was made
</p>
<p>that they ought to have some sort of signal for action, and the word ' Ruhe'
</p>
<p>was suggested by somebody. Waller could not tell who suggested it ;
</p>
<p>Schrade did not know it had been agreed upon. Evidently there was no
</p>
<p>very clear idea that night what ' Ruhe ' did mean, because Lingg saw it in
</p>
<p>the paper at eleven o'clock, and said : ' That is a signal that we ought to
</p>
<p>be over at 54 West Lake Street.' Waller finally, under close examination
</p>
<p>by the State, said the word ' Ruhe ' was to be inserted in the ' Letter-box '
</p>
<p>of the Arbeiter-Zeitung in the event of the time arriving for a downright
</p>
<p>revolution. Had that revolution come ; had it commenced when the word
</p>
<p>was put in the ' Letter-box ' ? No. When the members saw this in the
</p>
<p>' Letter-box ' what were they to do ? Go to the Haymarket and attack any-
</p>
<p>body ? No. They were to go to their respective places of meeting, and
</p>
<p>then, according to advices brought to them, were to determine upon a
</p>
<p>course of action. It had no reference to the throwing of the bomb at the
</p>
<p>Haymarket. Did that Monday night meeting pick out the man who was to
</p>
<p>throw the bomb ? Did it provide that a collision between the police and
</p>
<p>the people was to be brought about at the Haymarket ? Did it contem-
</p>
<p>plate murder ? Not at all. When Fischer told Spies that the word ' Ruhe '
</p>
<p>had no connection with the Haymarket meeting, he spoke the truth. It

</p>
<p>was a signal that the armed men should meet at the piaces designated by
</p>
<p>themselves to determine what action should be taken with reference to
</p>
<p>whatever might have transpired.
</p>
<p>" But it is to be borne in mind fhat the meeting of the armed section
</p>
<p>never took place. There was no meeting of the Northwest Side groups ;
</p>
<p>there was no meeting of any group pursuant to the word ' Ruhe.' Were
</p>
<p>any bombs to be thrown, any violence to be resorted to ? No. If the police
</p>
<p>made an attack, a committee was to take word to the groups, and the
</p>
<p>groups were then, and not till then, to determine what action they should
</p>
<p>take in the line of offense. Does that make every man who was present at
</p>
<p>the Monday night meeting responsible for the throwing of the bomb? Not
</p>
<p>at all. Unless they are all responsible, it does not make Fischer and Engel
</p>
<p>responsible. Engel was not at the Tuesday night meeting. Fischer was
</p>
<p>there and went quietly away before the bomb was thrown. There was
</p>
<p>absolutely nothing in connection with the Monday night meeting which
</p>
<p>contemplated violence at the Haymarket or provided for the throwing of
</p>
<p>the bomb.
</p>
<p>" Let me call your attention, in passing, to another thing. When Waller,
</p>
<p>A PLEA FOR "THIS BOY LINGG." 557
</p>
<p>having from some source heard of the lamentable occurrence at the Hay-
</p>
<p>market, went to Engel's house, he found him drinking beer with two or three
</p>
<p>friends. After listening to the details of the affair Engel said, while Waller
</p>
<p>was saying, ' Let's do something,' ' You had better go home. I have no
</p>
<p>sympathy with a movement of this kind. The police are of the common
</p>
<p>people, and when the general revolution does occur, they should be with us.
</p>
<p>I am utterly opposed to this slaughtering of them.' That is the full extent
</p>
<p>of the case against these two defendants, except the further fact that Fischer
</p>
<p>had a pistol and a dagger. It is not right to hang any man for the Hay-
</p>
<p>market murder simply because he had a dagger or a pistol in his possession.
</p>
<p>" As to Lingg, he came from that republic sitting in the center of Europe
</p>
<p>preaching the everlasting lesson of liberty. He came here in the fall of
</p>
<p>1885, and became a member of the Seliger household. Whatever he knows
</p>
<p>of social and labor conditions in this country he learned from those about
</p>
<p>him. He joined a carpenters' union, being himself a carpenter by trade.
</p>
<p>He attended the meetings of that union. Young, active, bright, capable,
</p>
<p>he enters the band of which they speak, and manufactures bombs. There
</p>
<p>is no law against that, gentlemen ; but they claim that is a circumstance
</p>
<p>from which you must draw the conclusion of his guilt, when taken with
</p>
<p>other circumstances, for the Haymarket tragedy. The State put on the
</p>
<p>stand one man, Lehman, to whom he gave bombs. Did he tell Lehman to
</p>
<p>go to the Haymarket and use the bombs there ? No. Lehman swears that
</p>
<p>he said : ' You take these and put them in a safe place.' And Lehman hid
</p>
<p>them where the officer, piloted by him, found them. Does that prove that
</p>
<p>Lingg sent a bomb to the Haymarket for the purpose of having somebody
</p>
<p>killed? How did he come to make bombs? Was it a matter to engage in
</p>
<p>on his own volition or responsibility ? No. The Carpenters' Union at one
</p>
<p>of its meetings resolved to devote a certain amount of money for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of experimenting with dynamite. You may say that was not right,
</p>
<p>but he was not responsible for it. There is no more reason in holding him
</p>
<p>responsible for the Haymarket affair on account of his experiments than
</p>
<p>there is to hold every other member of the Carpenters' Union for the same
</p>
<p>thing. That is how Lingg came to make bombs. Without dynamite a
</p>
<p>bomb-shell is a toy. The Lingg bombs would kill nobody unless some hu-

</p>
<p>man independent agency took hold of them. Did Lingg know on Monday
</p>
<p>night that one of his bombs was to be used ? He could not have known it,
</p>
<p>because the testimony is incontrovertible that it was understood by the men
</p>
<p>who met at 54 West Lake Street there should be no violence at the Hay-
</p>
<p>market meeting. And yet the State asks you to say that Lingg shall be
</p>
<p>hanged because he manufactured bombs. The man who threw the bomb
</p>
<p>did the independent act necessary for its explosion. Who was that man ?
</p>
<p>Was he connected with the defendants ? The evidence does not show it.
</p>
<p>"And a word more about that. This boy Lingg was dependent upon
</p>
<p>others as to his impressions of our institutions. He went to Seliger's house.
</p>
<p>Seliger is a Socialist ; he has been in this country for years. He is thirty-
</p>
<p>one years of age ; Lingg is twenty-one. And yet the great State of Illinois,
</p>
<p>through its legal representatives, bargains with William Seliger, the man of
</p>
<p>mature years, and with his wife, older even than himself, that if they will
</p>
<p>do what they can to put the noose around the neck of this boy they shall go
</p>
<p>scatheless ! Ah ! gentlemen, what a mockery of justice is this."
</p>
<p>Proceeding to discuss the Haymarket meeting, he held that there was
</p>
<p>558 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>no law that could take away the right of the people to meet and consider
</p>
<p>grievances. When it was proposed to adopt the Constitution, in 1787, the
</p>
<p>States were so careful to preserve the rights of the people that several
</p>
<p>amendments were put in. Capt. Black spoke of our forefathers, who
</p>
<p>had made the name of the revolutionist immortal, and referred to the
</p>
<p>meetings that had to be held as a preliminary to the great struggle.
</p>
<p>It had been charged against these men that they were guilty of misde-
</p>
<p>meanors for holding meetings, and they had been prosecuted for crimes.
</p>
<p>Before the Constitution could receive the approbation of the States, it had
</p>
<p>been necessary that the amendment providing that no laws should be
</p>
<p>passed by Congress abridging free speech should be inserted. Such a pro-
</p>
<p>vision had been incorporated in the first Constitution of Illinois in
</p>
<p>1818, and renewed in the subsequent Constitutions of 1848 and 1870. The
</p>
<p>Haymarket meeting had been called for the common good. Those men be-
</p>
<p>lieved that a great wrong had been done, a great outrage committed, and the
</p>
<p>rights of the citizens in that assemblage had been invaded by an unlawful,
</p>
<p>unwarrantable and outrageous act.
</p>
<p>" Bonfield, in his police office, surrounded by his minions, one hundred
</p>
<p>and eighty strong, armed to the teeth, knew that the meeting was quietly
</p>
<p>and peacefully coming to its close. Nay, he had said so to Carter Harrison.
</p>
<p>When Parsons had concluded, Mayor Harrison went to the station and told
</p>
<p>Bonfield that it was a quiet meeting, and Bonfield replied, 'My detectives
</p>
<p>make me the same report.' Yet Carter Harrison did not get out of hearing
</p>
<p>before Inspector Bonfield ordered his men to fall in for that death march.
</p>
<p>Who is responsible for it ? Who precipitated that conflict ? Who made
</p>
<p>that battle in that street that night ? The law looks at the approximate
</p>
<p>cause, not the remote. The law looks at the man immediately in fault ; not
</p>
<p>at some man who may have manufactured the pistol that does the shooting,
</p>
<p>the dynamite that kills, the bomb that explodes. I ask you, upon your
</p>
<p>oath before God, in a full and honest consideration of this entire testimony,
</p>
<p>who made the Haymarket massacre ? Who is responsible for that collision ?
</p>
<p>If Bonfield had not marched there, would there have been any death ?
</p>
<p>Would not that meeting have dissolved precisely as it proposed to do ?
</p>
<p>Did the bomb-thrower go down to the station where the police were and

</p>
<p>attack them ? A bomb could have been thrown into that station with even
</p>
<p>more deadly effect than at the Haymarket itself. There they were, massed
</p>
<p>together in close quarters, in hiding, like a wild beast in its lair ready to
</p>
<p>spring. Did the bomb-thrower move upon them ? Was there here a design
</p>
<p>to destroy ? God sent that warning cloud into the heavens ; these men
</p>
<p>were still there, speaking their last words ; but a deadlier cloud was coming
</p>
<p>up behind this armed force. In disregard of our constitutional rights as
</p>
<p>citizens, it was proposed to order the dispersal of a peaceable meeting.
</p>
<p>Has it come to pass that under the Constitution of the United States and
</p>
<p>of this State, our meetings for the discussion of grievances are subject to
</p>
<p>be scattered to the winds at the breath of a petty police officer? Can they
</p>
<p>take into their hands the law ? If so, that is Anarchy ; nay, the chaos of
</p>
<p>constitutional right and legally guaranteed liberty. I ask you again,
</p>
<p>charging no legal responsibility here, but looking at the man who is morally

</p>
<p>have been but for the act of Bonfield ? "
</p>
<p>Captain Black went on to say that as long as the Mayor was there Bon-
</p>
<p>field could not act, but as soon as Harrison had gone the officer could not
</p>
<p>get to the Haymarket quick enough. The police, the speaker urged, had
</p>
<p>been searching the files of the Arbeiter-Zeitung and the Alarm for years to
</p>
<p>put before the jury the most inflammatory articles. After alluding to Christ
</p>
<p>as the great Socialist of Judea, who first preached the Socialism taught
</p>
<p>by Spies and his other modern apostles, he compared John Brown and his

</p>
<p>STATE'S ATTORNEY GRINNELL took Wednesday and a part of
</p>
<p>Thursday in which to deliver his argument. He indulged in no flights
</p>
<p>of oratory, but presented a review of the case at once able, convincing and
</p>
<p>unassailable. He began as follows :
</p>
<p>"I said to you in the opening, gentlemen, that in this country, above all
</p>
<p>countries in the world, is Anarchy possible. In my investigations of this
</p>
<p>case, in my conduct with it, with my knowledge of my own country and the
</p>
<p>freedom we enjoy and possess, I have been led to conclude that that is
</p>
<p>true. In those strong European governments, where there is monarchical
</p>
<p>or strongly centralized government, they strangle Anarchy or ship it here.
</p>
<p>Everybody comes to our climate ; everybody reaches our shores ; our free-
</p>
<p>dom is great and it should never be abridged and here with that free-
</p>
<p>dom, with that great enjoyment of liberty to all men, they seek to obtain
</p>
<p>their end by Anarchy, which in other countries is impossible. As I said,
</p>
<p>there is one step from republicanism to Anarchy. Let us never take that
</p>
<p>step, and, gentlemen, the responsibility which has devolved upon you in
</p>
<p>this case is greater than any jury in the history of the world ever undertook.
</p>
<p>This is no slight or mean duty that you are called upon to perform. You
</p>
<p>are to say whether that step shall be taken.
</p>
<p>"When the Haymarket tragedy occurred, the spontaneous declaration
</p>
<p>by every honest, every law-abiding man and woman in this city was : 'An
</p>
<p>outrage has been perpetrated ; a great crime has been committed ; but let

</p>
<p>there be a cool, unimpassioned trial and let the guilty suffer. Then and
</p>
<p>not till then.' That has been the sentiment of every newspaper in this city
</p>
<p>from which counsel sought to make you believe by quotations there had
</p>
<p>been something said to the contrary. The little extracts and abstracts that
</p>
<p>have been clipped from the newspapers that they have talked to you about
</p>
<p>are such extracts as met the disapproval of the newspapers. And even as
</p>
<p>to what Capt. Black referred to the other day in your hearing and which
</p>
<p>Foster elaborated to you, something that some crank has written to the
</p>
<p>Inter-Ocean as to what should be done with these defendants, horrifying
</p>
<p>you by the recital as he did what does the newspaper say ? That the
</p>
<p>man who wrote it was as bad as an Anarchist ; that we are here to maintain
</p>
<p>5 6o
</p>
<p>THE COUNTRY'S LIFE AT STAKE. 561
</p>
<p>the law, not break it. And that can be said of every newspaper in this
</p>
<p>city. There never has been in the history of America, in the world, such
</p>
<p>unanimity of sentiment as has prevailed through the length and breadth of
</p>
<p>this country, not only as to the crime itself and the perpetrators, but as to
</p>
<p>the perpetrators having a fair trial. And why, especially, has there been
</p>
<p>so much talk about a fair trial in this case ? Because every honest, country-
</p>
<p>loving American citizen knew that his country's life was at stake, and the
</p>
<p>only thing to do was to demonstrate the strength of the law by a fair trial,
</p>
<p>which the defendants have had."
</p>
<p>Mr. Grinnell at this point went into a very lengthy discussion of the law
</p>
<p>in the case. He showed conclusively that in a conspiracy the men who had
</p>
<p>advised and abetted the commission of the crime were fully as guilty as the
</p>
<p>man who had actually made himself the instrument of their deed. Inas-
</p>
<p>much as the instructions given by the court to the jury are really a concise
</p>
<p>and complete statement of the points of law which Mr. Grinnell and the
</p>
<p>other attorneys for the State urged, I have taken the liberty to omit that
</p>
<p>part of the address.
</p>
<p>Coming to the facts in the case, Mr. Grinnell, in his examination of the
</p>
<p>attempt made by the defense to impeach Gilmer's testimony, said :
</p>
<p>"A few days, gentlemen, after the Haymarket riot, for a whole'week, as
</p>
<p>is plain from the testimony in this case, and from Captain Schaack, there
</p>
<p>was not the least particle of knowledge or a suspicion, great as had been
</p>
<p>the crime that was committed there there was not a suspicion that it was
</p>
<p>any farther-reaching than the result of these repeated inflammatory speeches
</p>
<p>which our city had listened to for years. But the magnificent efforts of
</p>
<p>Schaack, without my knowledge at that time, got the leading-string which
</p>
<p>led to the conspiracy. Then it was, for the first time, that we knew of
</p>
<p>Schnaubelt, or that we knew or suspected that a conspiracy existed at all.
</p>
<p>I confess here, gentlemen, a weakness ; because, whatever may be the
</p>
<p>instincts of the prosecutor, as they say, I have not been so long in this office
</p>
<p>as to be callous to human sentiments and to humanity, and I have not yet
</p>
<p>become so hardened that I believe everybody accused of a crime is guilty.
</p>
<p>I hope in the prosecution of my duty, and in this office, that that time will
</p>
<p>never come. When we had Spies under arrest, I confess to you that then,

</p>
<p>and after it was developed that a conspiracy existed I confess the weakness
</p>
<p>that I did not suppose that a man living in our community would enter
</p>
<p>into a conspiracy so hellish and damnable as the proof showed, and our
</p>
<p>investigations subsequently showed, he had entered into ; and therefore,
</p>
<p>notwithstanding Gilmer's statement to us so frequently, Spies was not shown
</p>
<p>to him and not identified.
</p>
<p>" Honesty of purpose is the only thing that will determine, in every way,
</p>
<p>the right from the wrong.
</p>
<p>" It may sound to you a little out of place for me to say here that the
</p>
<p>only mistake I have made the only mistake that has been pointed out to
</p>
<p>you that I have made and I frankly confess it was a mistake was the
</p>
<p>suggestion in my opening about the bomb-thrower. We knew the facts.
</p>
<p>There was no law compelling me to make any statement. I might have
</p>
<p>proceeded with the proof, if I desired, without any opening statement. I
</p>
<p>did make an opening. I undertook to make it fairly and frankly and broad.
</p>
<p>562 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>I was afraid of wearying you, as I was weary myself, from the days and days
</p>
<p>that we had been working here in getting a jury, and the anxiety under
</p>
<p>which I labored. I said in that opening that we would show to you who
</p>
<p>threw that bomb. I said in that opening that we would show that the man
</p>
<p>left the wagon, lighted the match and threw the bomb. That was not ab-
</p>
<p>solutely correct. I should have said that the man who came from the
</p>
<p>wagon, assisted the bomb-thrower, as the proof shows, and who we knew
</p>
<p>came from the wagon, was in that group, and that the bomb was thrown by
</p>
<p>a man whom we would show to you.
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen, let me proceed, as fast as I can, in the discussion of another
</p>
<p>branch of this case. The gentlemen upon the other side have said to you
</p>
<p>deliberately, for the purpose of gaining some favor in your eyes for their
</p>
<p>clients, that this is a plain, simple case of murder, and that we have no
</p>
<p>right to discuss anything or talk about anything except that which occurred
</p>
<p>at the Haymarket meeting. They read some law to you, yesterday, upon
</p>
<p>that proposition. It was inapplicable, and was manifestly so. There never
</p>
<p>was a murder committed in the world, be it treasonable murder or the mur-
</p>
<p>der for mere gain, but what the trial of the perpetrator meant an investiga-
</p>
<p>tion of the life of the man who committed the murder. What had been his
</p>
<p>utterances ? What has he said ? Has he threatened life ? Has he talked
</p>
<p>against a system represented by police? Has 'he advised the use of dyna-
</p>
<p>mite ? Has he advised the use of poison ? Has he advised the use cf the
</p>
<p>pistol, the rifle, the musket, to accomplish his end ? Those are legitimate
</p>
<p>sources of investigation. And further than that, as the gentlemen well know,
</p>
<p>you can go back in those declarations fcr years and years, and there is no
</p>
<p>statute of limitation against threats, when a repeated threat results in the
</p>
<p>deed threatened.
</p>
<p>" On the lake front, at the different halls in the city of Chicago, at
</p>
<p>these Communistic or Socialistic halls, as the gentlemen called them they
</p>
<p>are Anarchistic halls ; don't let us have any mistake about names and titles
</p>
<p>in all these months and years there has been openly preached to the cit-
</p>
<p>izens of this city treason and murder by these defendants. Why ? To
</p>
<p>bring about a social revolution. And these humanitarians, these God-like
</p>
<p>men, these defendants who have the similitude of Christ peace have

</p>
<p>openly talked murder in our streets. I think it ought to have been stopped
</p>
<p>before. I think when they made the utterance from the lake front, or
</p>
<p>any other spot in the city of Chicago, that they should have been snatched
</p>
<p>by policemen and' taken to the station and fined for disorderly conduct, as
</p>
<p>that would be as far as they could go, except under the common-law rule
</p>
<p>which provides that if they had advised murder then they could have been
</p>
<p>punished for such advice. We know more law to-day than we did I do,
</p>
<p>I am very glad to say."
</p>
<p>Following this, Mr. Grinnell took up the case against each of the con-
</p>
<p>spirators as follows :
</p>
<p>"Why was Engel preparing for the purchase of a large amount of
</p>
<p>arms ? That has not been disputed. There is testimony in this case that
</p>
<p>Engel not later than last winter, and perhaps in the spring, negotiated for
</p>
<p>a large amount of arms, with his daughter present. His daughter has not
</p>
<p>been placed upon the stand to deny that fact. Why ? He was not a
</p>
<p>dealer in arms. It could have been denied if not true. He is a keeper
</p>
<p>of a toy-store, it appears, over on Milwaukee Avenue. These belligerent
</p>
<p>THE PINKERTON REPORTS. 563
</p>
<p>humanitarians, these men whom Black would have you surround and cover
</p>
<p>with garlands these are the men that we have demonstrated before you
</p>
<p>have been buying arms and preparing for years for something. Why was
</p>
<p>it that Parsons at another place, no later than last winter, or late in the fall,
</p>
<p>also negotiated for a large amount of arms ? Has he denied it ? He has been
</p>
<p>on the witness-stand. Why did he negotiate for arms ? For humanitarian
</p>
<p>purposes ? Why, gentlemen, to dispose of the bloodhounds, the police, the
</p>
<p>capitalists. That has been their cry. Their cry on the lake front and
</p>
<p>everywhere has been that same treasonable, infamous cry. Is that the only
</p>
<p>place they have spoken ? Their halls are all over the city. Look at the
</p>
<p>testimony of Johnson, the detective, on that subject. The only testimony
</p>
<p>against Johnson, the only syllable in this proof against Pinkerton's detective
</p>
<p>who is called Johnson, or Jansen, is Foster's that is all, except that
</p>
<p>Fielden said, as I remember, that the man O'Brien, in whose presence
</p>
<p>Johnson said Fielden made the remark about a little dynamite in his pocket,
</p>
<p>was not here, and that therefore he did not say it. Why, Fielden had been
</p>
<p>saying it for years he had been talking it day after day and Sunday after
</p>
<p>Sunday on the lake shore.
</p>
<p>"He had been talking it year in and year out. He had been speaking
</p>
<p>for dynamite and demanding its use by the workingmen, and advising them
</p>
<p>to arm themselves with it for months and years. Foster said that Johnson
</p>
<p>is not to be believed because he is a detective, and he delivered a very
</p>
<p>pleasant lecture on that subject. I presume he has delivered it in every
</p>
<p>important trial that he has ever been in. It is the ordinary language, the
</p>
<p>usual philippic against detectives, I suppose. I never saw a detective on
</p>
<p>the witness-stand that commended himself so favorably to the honest con-
</p>
<p>sideration of any listener as did Johnson. And after he had withstood that
</p>
<p>severe, critical and exasperating cross-examination of Foster, he still stood
</p>
<p>there a monument of strength to the truth which he had uttered. He had
</p>
<p>said nothing, gentlemen, but what had been in the public press for years
</p>
<p>about these utterances ; and they have not denied a single syllable of his
</p>
<p>testimony. I suppose then, gentlemen, from that follows another proposi-
</p>
<p>tion that we, in the city of Chicago and elsewhere, must suffer murder,
</p>
<p>must be robbed, our friends killed, our houses invaded, law set at defiance,

</p>
<p>because it would be unfortunate to have anybody convicted who was guilty
</p>
<p>on the testimony of the detective. Foster said there never was any great
</p>
<p>murder trial in the world but what there is a detective in it. That may be
</p>
<p>so. The peculiarity of this murder trial and the detective is this that
</p>
<p>this report was made from day to day by the detective to his principals,
</p>
<p>and by them to citizens, long before this murder. The detective that Fos-
</p>
<p>ter pictures is the one who after the act goes back to make up a case.
</p>
<p>This w,as making the case without thinking that it would ever take place,
</p>
<p>and the actual written statements made by him from night to night and
</p>
<p>from day to day were here in court ; and if they were not, the fact has not
</p>
<p>been denied, and these men have been on the stand. Why didn't they
</p>
<p>deny it ? Did any of them deny the existence of the armed group and the
</p>
<p>marching backward and forward and the explanation of the dynamite cans
</p>
<p>at Greif's Hall? No; -none of them denied it. They would have denied
</p>
<p>it if it had not been so absolutely strong in its proof. The written evidence,
</p>
<p>the handwriting on the wall, was against these men.
</p>
<p>" But, not content, these revolutionists, these traitors, these men who
</p>
<p>have committed treason I thank again the gentleman for the word
</p>
<p>564 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>these men who have committed treason are not content with confining their
</p>
<p>power and influence to the small limits of Cook County, but Spies goes to
</p>
<p>Grand Rapids and there gives utterance to these same treasonable sen-
</p>
<p>tences ; and there is no doubt that other proselytes of the humanitarian
</p>
<p>crowd were at other places in the country doing the same thing. It seems
</p>
<p>that Parsons was at Cincinnati Sunday or Saturday before the Haymarket
</p>
<p>difficulty. Was he down there for the same purpose that Spies was at
</p>
<p>Grand Rapids ? And at Grand Rapids, what did Spies say ? He said that
</p>
<p>the social revolution must come, would come when there were great num-
</p>
<p>bers of laboring men out of employment, and foreshadowed the difficulties
</p>
<p>in the ensuing year, in 1886. The great things that he was to accomplish
</p>
<p>then were foreshadowed. ' But,' said Moulton to him, the other witness
</p>
<p>heard the conversation, 'they will strangle you like a lot of snakes. It will
</p>
<p>be murder.' ' Oh no ; oh no. No murder about this. We are humani-
</p>
<p>tarians. No murder. We will succeed. It will be revolution, and I, great
</p>
<p>Spies, will be the second Washington of America.' The second Washing-
</p>
<p>ton of America ! ' But if you fail?' says Moulton. ' Of course, if we fail,
</p>
<p>that is another thing; but we ain't going to fail.' 'Why?' 'Because
</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands of laboring men will be out of employment all over
</p>
<p>the United States, and they have the power.' That is the friend of the
</p>
<p>laboring man, the Anarchist and friend of the laboring man, advocating
</p>
<p>the destruction of property to advance the interests of the laboring man.
</p>
<p>It would be a great benefit to me, with the very little property that I have,,
</p>
<p>to have it destroyed ; it would enrich me so at once !
</p>
<p>" But that is not all and there has been no dispute about that inter-
</p>
<p>view with Moulton, not a syllable of dispute about that interview from any
</p>
<p>source. Counsel did not even undertake to cross-examine Moulton. His
</p>
<p>intelligence was such, he was so clear-headed and concise in what he
</p>
<p>uttered, that they dropped him. What was all this for? That meant prep-
</p>
<p>aration and threats toward what? Toward murder, the social revolution
</p>
<p>and it was murder. That is why this is competent evidence. That is why
</p>
<p>the utterances of these men are material and necessary. That is why the
</p>
<p>proof is overpowering.

<p>day to day. They have made indignant every man who has listened to
</p>
<p>them or read them. They have caused other things they have caused
</p>
<p>bloodshed and riot.
</p>
<p>" Foster says to you that there is no difficulty about the black flag ; that
</p>
<p>that is a flag they use over in Europe to march around with, showing their
</p>
<p>humanitarian desires, or that they are hungry that that is what it means.
</p>
<p>It does not mean that here. They were going to march down Michigan
</p>
<p>Avenue under the black flag and strike terror to the hearts of the capitalists.
</p>
<p>Didn't Fielden and Spies and Parsons and all that gang understand that
</p>
<p>when the valiant crowd would march up Michigan Avenue under the black
</p>
<p>flag, it meant death, no quarter, piracy ?
</p>
<p>" But that is not all. The Board of Trade meeting occurs, and there
</p>
<p>the black flag and the red flag were carried. The article has been read to-
</p>
<p>you, and it is unnecessary to go into that again. And there they say that
</p>
<p>that meeting was copiously supplied with nitro-glycerine pills, or some-
</p>
<p>thing of that kind. They did not get at the Board of Trade, but had to
</p>
<p>march clear around it, within a block of it, and then vented their spite
</p>
<p>aroused by their difficulties, vented their spite in speeches from the Arbeiter-
</p>
<p>THE BLACK AND THE RED. 565
</p>
<p>Zeitung office that night, commending their valorous deeds and acts, only
</p>
<p>saying that they were preparing for them, declaring: 'We will wait for
</p>
<p>some other time, when we are ready for the police.' They did not expect
</p>
<p>any police that night. They thought they would march right down. The
</p>
<p>police began to wake up.
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen, the red flag has passed in our streets enough. At that
</p>
<p>meeting which they comment so much upon in the Alarm and the Arbeiter-
</p>
<p>Zeitung, representing its peculiarities, its honor, and its humanitarian in-
</p>
<p>fluences, they suggest that the red flag that was carried there, and carried
</p>
<p>by women, that it is the flag of universal liberty, and it is so described here
</p>
<p>on the witness-stand. Ah, gentlemen, there is but one flag of liberty in this
</p>
<p>land, and that is the stars and stripes. That flag is planted on our soil, and
</p>
<p>planted to stay, if you have the courage to carry out the law. It is a plant
</p>
<p>of liberty.
</p>
<p>The blades of heroes fence it round ;
</p>
<p>Where'er it springs is holy ground.
</p>
<p>From tower and dome its glories spread ;
</p>
<p>It waves where lonely sentries tread.
</p>
<p>It makes the land as ocean free,
</p>
<p>And plants an empire on the sea
</p>
<p>Always the banner of the free,
</p>
<p>The starry flower of liberty.
</p>
<p>" That is the flag that these men want to wipe out and supplant with the
</p>
<p>black and the red. No wonder those flags over there (indicating flags
</p>
<p>offered in evidence) disturbed Foster. He is an American citizen, not
</p>
<p>tinctured or tainted with any of the Anarchy of his clients.
</p>
<p>"There is one other suggestion I want to make to you in this connec-
</p>
<p>tion. I wish to hurry along and be as brief as possible. As has been said
</p>
<p>to you by counsel, the case in its magnitude and scope is so great that no
</p>
<p>one man can cover it. Some branches of this case, and nearly all, have
</p>
<p>been well covered by Mr. Walker and Mr. Ingham, who preceded me. But
</p>
<p>there is one forcible suggestion brought to my attention by. Mr. Ingham,
</p>
<p>and I wish to again ask : Why all these threats ? Why all this talk ? Why
</p>
<p>so many threats of murder, outside of the question of the desire to accom-

</p>
<p>plish that end ? Ah ! gentlemen, it is so that the revolution could more
</p>
<p>easily take place by causing terror in your hearts and my heart. That is
</p>
<p>what it meant : causing terror in the heart of every American citizen, and
</p>
<p>thereby making more easy the accomplishment of that which they desire
</p>
<p>and preach. Why all these armed groups, scattered throughout and
</p>
<p>operating in the city of 'Chicago, as they all say, as Most explains in his
</p>
<p>book, as Spies explains and as Parsons and all in their speeches explain ?
</p>
<p>Why this network of groups ? It was the nucleus, the foundation from
</p>
<p>which that social revolution was to spring, and these armed men were to do
</p>
<p>their part of the duty. There was a desire to strike terror that is the
</p>
<p>watchword to strike terror to the hearts of the capitalists and their min-
</p>
<p>ions, the bloodhounds of the police. That is what it meant. Threaten life
</p>
<p>specific in one direction and threaten the peaceful citizens and the
</p>
<p>law-abiding citizens on the other hand, so that they would throw up both
</p>
<p>hands at once, and let it go on. That was their scheme. Why? Because
</p>
<p>these men, in their craven spirit, supposed that one hundred thousand hon-
</p>
<p>est laboring men in this town would at once wheel in behind the ranks of
</p>
<p>the three thousand and mow down everybody else. Lingg, who told Capt.
</p>
<p>566 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>Schaack of all the bombs, not admitting that he had made the bomb that
</p>
<p>killed Degan, admitted and told Schaack that they were pills and medicine
</p>
<p>for the police and capitalists.
</p>
<p>' They were not the friends of the laboring man, although they were
</p>
<p>always talking about that in public such wonderful friends of the laboring
</p>
<p>man ! Gentlemen, they wanted to kill the pystem. They said they wanted
</p>
<p>to kill the system, and on the witness-stand here they said that on that
</p>
<p>night of the Haymarket massacre they meant the system. What system ?
</p>
<p>The system of law. They have no malice in their hearts against the seven
</p>
<p>officers Oh ! no. They did not know them. It was not the seven officers,
</p>
<p>as persons, they desired to kill ; but they desired to kill the officers, and all
</p>
<p>of them, in order to kill the system the system of law.
</p>
<p>" Besides the frequent declarations that have been proven here as to the
</p>
<p>designs of these men foolishly and dishonestly to represent themselves as
</p>
<p>the friends of the laboring man, they have said in their writings, and they
</p>
<p>have preached on the stump, that the eight-hour movement, as a movement,
</p>
<p>would not help the laboring man. And why ? Because the laboring man
</p>
<p>must have Anarchy must have what other people have got in the way of
</p>
<p>property, as they have defined in their ideas of property. Black calls that a
</p>
<p>theory.
</p>
<p>"Declarations threatening dynamite were made in our midst for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of terrorizing the people, and causing them to believe that these men
</p>
<p>were more powerful than they were, and thereby causing the laboring man
</p>
<p>to come to their ranks. It was a bid for the laboring man that is what it
</p>
<p>was, and that is why Wilkinson's interview was so easily obtained.
</p>
<p>Wilkinson interviewed these men, and published in the Daily News of the
</p>
<p>I4th day of January, 1886, his interview with Spies as to the purposes and
</p>
<p>objects of the revolutionists and Anarchists in the city of Chicago. What
</p>
<p>did he say? He told about the bombs, the dynamite, their preparation,
</p>
<p>their network of groups, their thousands of armed men. in the city of Chi-
</p>
<p>cago, their drilling from day to day or week to week. He gave him a
</p>
<p>sample of a bomb, and told him further that the Arbeiter-Zeitung office was
</p>
<p>a place for the distribution of bombs in the city of Chicago, and upon his
</p>
<p>own testimony it appears that he received bombs, as Mr. Ingham has ex-

<p>plained to you, from one part of the country ; and then samples were
</p>
<p>brought in two more, of which the one here presented and called the Czar
</p>
<p>bomb was one.
</p>
<p>"And now, why did he do all that? Why did this foolish man do that?
</p>
<p>They want you to acquit him because he is foolish. Why did this foolish
</p>
<p>man do all that ? Gentlemen, the answer is plain and simple. First,
</p>
<p>vanity the second Washington of this country! God save the memory
</p>
<p>of the father of our country.
</p>
<p>" Another thing, he wanted to demonstrate through the public press to
</p>
<p>the one hundred thousand honest laborers in Chicago that Anarchy had
</p>
<p>come. That is what he wanted. That is why it was advertised. That is
</p>
<p>why he so flippantly discussed open secrets in that way. He wanted the
</p>
<p>laboring man to follow in the wake of the despoilers of our country, the
</p>
<p>Anarchists. Yes, and fearing that such talk in the newspapers would scare
</p>
<p>some of his conspirators and co-workers in evil, he goes to Fielden when
</p>
<p>they were having a meeting at Greif's Hall a day or two after, and says to
</p>
<p>him, ' Go light on that interview among our companions ; they may be scared
</p>
<p>off.' He was obliged to hedge among his companions to keep them in

<p>THE RIGHTS OF "SCABS." 567
</p>
<p>control, and by his vaporings, as they call it, seek to pull to them tne one
</p>
<p>hundred thousand laborers in this town. If there had been a possibility of
</p>
<p>the accomplishment of his designs, what would we have done in this city
</p>
<p>with one hundred thousand men let loose ? Parsons says he was a Knight
</p>
<p>of Labor. His very paper abuses Powderly, the genius and inspiration of
</p>
<p>the Knights of Labor in this country. Their honest leaders in this country
</p>
<p>are men who are opposed to Anarchy, and in the organization of the Knights
</p>
<p>of Labor, gentlemen, the one element in it to-day which is dangerous to it
</p>
<p>and the rights of the laboring man is the very element of Anarchy danger-
</p>
<p>ous wherever it is.
</p>
<p>" Parsons was buying arms, negotiating for them ; Engel was negotiat-
</p>
<p>ing for them ; Lingg was making bombs ; Fischer was doing the work of
</p>
<p>Spies in the promulgation of their ideas ; Fielden was making speeches
</p>
<p>preparing the public ; Parsons, in his humanitarian designs against his own
</p>
<p>country, where his fathers were born and lived he*was writing and speak-
</p>
<p>ing for the social revolution and against all law, as was Schwab and Spies,
</p>
<p>and it was to take place the ist of May, 1886. Gentlemen, as I said in the
</p>
<p>opening, I say again, Spies appeared at the McCormick meeting for the
</p>
<p>purpose of inflaming that crowd to the highest intensity, as expressed in
</p>
<p>their editorials to the highest pitch of excitement appeared at that crowd
</p>
<p>and spoke. It appears from his own lips, and appears in proof here, that
</p>
<p>before he spoke there had been no riot ; that while he was speaking the
</p>
<p>rioting occurred and the difficulty was precipitated. I take, gentlemen, his
</p>
<p>explanation, given by himself, written that night, as the full explanation.
</p>
<p>He in that article says : ' If there had been one dynamite bomb. 1 Think
</p>
<p>of the horror ! It makes one's blood run cold these men deliberating
</p>
<p>with such infamy the destruction of life and property in a country which
</p>
<p>has freedom for its basis and freedom for its glory, and talking riot and
</p>
<p>bloodshed.
</p>
<p>"I am not going to discuss further that McCormick meeting, except to
</p>
<p>make this suggestion that seems to have been omitted. It is in regard to
</p>
<p>the ' Revenge ' circular. I say, gentlemen, that the basis of the ' Revenge '
</p>
<p>circular is a lie, premeditated, deliberate, infamous, and is the key-note to
</p>
<p>the situation.

<p>" McCormick had some laboring men it is the high privilege, the great
</p>
<p>and high privilege of the defendants in this case to call them ' scabs.' We
</p>
<p>will call them 'scabs.' They were working at McCormick's for their honest
</p>
<p>daily bread. They had no fight with the world. They were seeking their
</p>
<p>subsistence by daily toil. They had rights which every man should respect ;
</p>
<p>they had the right to peaceful employment, of coming and going to their
</p>
<p>labor as they saw fit. They came out of that great factory, only a moment
</p>
<p>before teeming with the busy throb of life, to be set upon, attacked and
</p>
<p>murdered by the strikers whom defendant Spies was speaking to. Who
</p>
<p>there was entitled to protection, gentlemen? Was it the duty of the police
</p>
<p>to protect the ' scabs,' or the six thousand, part of whom began the riot ? The
</p>
<p>time that the attack occurred, gentlemen, there were only two policemen on
</p>
<p>the ground. Those two policemen that came out of McCormick's factory
</p>
<p>nearly lost their lives; one of them was stoned nearly to death ; secured
</p>
<p>himself in a patrol box, which was afterwards pulled down, and all for what ?
</p>
<p>Because a few 'scabs' coming out of McCormick's on their way to their
</p>
<p>homes and their families had been attacked by the mob which Spies was
</p>
<p>addressing and instigating. The two policemen called a patrol wagon in
</p>
<p>568 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>order, as was their right and duty, to protect the property of McCormick, the
</p>
<p>lives of the ' scabs ' who swam the river, and the lives of the two officers who
</p>
<p>were there then. He calls such protection of a few ' scabs' against this army
</p>
<p>of strikers which he sought to inflame and did not entirely succeed calls
</p>
<p>that transaction the bloodhounds of the police wickedly shooting down your
</p>
<p>friends. It was a lie. The police were there in honored duty, protecting
</p>
<p>life and property, and the mob began the fight, and not the police. Not
</p>
<p>only has Spies declared in that circular that men were killed who were not,
</p>
<p>but that men were injured who were not hurt ; not only that, but, pervading
</p>
<p>it, the whole of it, is a lie, and the purpose of that lie was to inflame the
</p>
<p>laboring men. He rushed down to his office and wrote that circular, as he
</p>
<p>says, 'with his blood boiling against the outrages of the police.' Poor
</p>
<p>bloodhounds of the police, who had undertaken to protect the lives of a few
</p>
<p>people, and McCormick, who is unfortunate enough to own more property
</p>
<p>than perhaps any of us to protect his property from being stoned, and his
</p>
<p>premises pillaged, and his men murdered. He writes the ' Revenge '
</p>
<p>circular and prepares for war.
</p>
<p>" They had prepared, before the McCormick meeting, for this difficulty.
</p>
<p>At Emma Street, on Sunday, was a conspiracy meeting of these infamous
</p>
<p>scoundrels, and among them was Fischer, seeking our lives seeking the
</p>
<p>destruction of the law. They agreed upon the plan they agreed upon
</p>
<p>' Ruhe ' they agreed that the meeting of the armed men should be called
</p>
<p>for Tuesday night. It is in the history of this conspiracy that the first
</p>
<p>meeting on that Sunday contemplated the difficulties at McCormick's.
</p>
<p>Where is this Thielen ? Where is this German friend this comrade?
</p>
<p>He was down there with Comrade Spies, on the top of that car, and their
</p>
<p>intention was to do that which was done to excite that mob. That was
</p>
<p>the preliminary step in this conspiracy to the open infraction of law. The
</p>
<p>general conspiracy had been going along for weeks, perhaps for months ; it
</p>
<p>may be for years. But the details of the conspiracy were arranged at the
</p>
<p>Emma Street meeting. Then comes the McCormick meeting, the inflaming
</p>
<p>of the workingmen, and then what ? The production of the ' Revenge '
</p>
<p>circular, to still more incite them. The armed men meet at that Emma
</p>
<p>Street place, where the Northwest Side group meet the group that the

</p>
<p>worst Anarchists in the city belong to at that Emma Street meeting it
</p>
<p>was discussed, talked about and suggested, and at that meeting it was
</p>
<p>arranged and talked about as to where and how the fighting should be done
</p>
<p>when the contest came. How was it to be done ? One man suggested that
</p>
<p>they should go into the crowd themselves, and begin killing then and there.
</p>
<p>Another says : ' That won't do ; we may come in contact with the police-
</p>
<p>men or a detective and our lives' - yes, their precious lives 'might be at
</p>
<p>stake.' That plan was rejected that part of it. And another thing you
</p>
<p>will remember : that it was settled that the meeting should not be on the
</p>
<p>Market Square, down here on the South Side, because ' it was a mouse trap,'
</p>
<p>because the power of the police, the militia and everything of that character
</p>
<p>was such that it was impossible to get out of the way, at Market Square, if
</p>
<p>the contest came. Courageous men !
</p>
<p>"After Spies had written that circular, after he had had it printed, where
</p>
<p>does it appear? He has it sent over to the printer by a boy ; and that cir-
</p>
<p>cular, printed by him, ordered by him, is distributed broadcast through the
</p>
<p>city, by whose order? By Spies'. It is another significant fact, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, that it appears at every meeting almost simultaneously with the con-
</p>
<p>CURIOUS COINCIDENCES. 569
</p>
<p>spiracy meeting ; as I remember, brought there either by Fischer or Bal-
</p>
<p>thasar Rau that I would not be sure of ; but it appears almost like the
</p>
<p>wind in all parts of the city, distributed from horseback, and it never could
</p>
<p>have been distributed if it had not been done at the order of the arch-
</p>
<p>conspirator of all, August Spies. That circular was intended to 'inflame; it
</p>
<p>did inflame. It inflamed people throughout the city who read it ; it was a
</p>
<p>lie. They could not know that. The police had not committed the out-
</p>
<p>rages, but the mob had. There had not been that number killed nor
</p>
<p>wounded. They could not know that. Their apostle, the individual who
</p>
<p>has been their leader, had said, ' To arms ! ' Some answer, ' We will.'
</p>
<p>That is Anarchy. Gentlemen, it is unnecessary for me to go over step by
</p>
<p>step that conspiracy. It is established here so that it never can be moved.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ingham and Mr. Walker went over the ground thoroughly and com-
</p>
<p>pletely. The defense has seen fit to let it alone. The conspiracy was
</p>
<p>established, and all the defendants show themselves as coming into it.
</p>
<p>Isn't it significant that on Tuesday, on Tuesday morning, between nine and
</p>
<p>ten, as I understand, Parsons appeared from Cincinnati ? What does he
</p>
<p>do ? He rushes straight to the Daily News office before eleven o'clock, and
</p>
<p>inserts a notice for the American group to meet at the Arbeiter-Zeitung
</p>
<p>office, where it never had met before. For what purpose ? For the purpose
</p>
<p>of ' important business.' If that had been an honest desire to have the
</p>
<p>important business for the purpose of arranging the sewing girls and their
</p>
<p>employment, or making a union among the sewing girls, as they now claim,
</p>
<p>why didn't he say so ? Before eleven o'clock Parsons appears and has this
</p>
<p>article inserted. Why? So that the main head centers of the conspiracy
</p>
<p>could be readily reached when the contest came 'to its highest intensity'
</p>
<p>at the Haymarket. Not another day in the whole history of this organiza-
</p>
<p>tion has the American group ever met at Fifth Avenue. Why didn't it
</p>
<p>meet over at the other place, at Greif's Hall, where it always met ? That
</p>
<p>would not do, because there were meetings there, conspiracy meetings and
</p>
<p>everything else. Whom else do we find here at this Arbeiter-Zeitung office?
</p>
<p>Schwab. What for ? He was not a member of the American group ?
</p>
<p>What was he there for ? He was there, too, for that purpose. He had
</p>
<p>been talking and writing, as has been read to you, about Anarchy and

<p>bloodshed and dynamite and rifles, and he appears at the Arbeiter-Zeitung
</p>
<p>office for the first time, when the American group meets; never was there
</p>
<p>with them before, so far as this proof shows.
</p>
<p>"Fischer seeks to obtain this circular printed ; that is his part of the pro-
</p>
<p>gramme ; he goes out there is no dispute about these facts he goes out
</p>
<p>of the meeting and finds the printing-office closed. He waits until the next
</p>
<p>morning. Now, this man is a printer ; he is the friend of Spies ; he went
</p>
<p>from Spies when the circular was printed ; he was in the meeting at which
</p>
<p>the circular was distributed ; he knows, as a matter of fact, that Spies wrote
</p>
<p>that circular, ' Workingmen, to arms.' Spies is his general, his boss and
</p>
<p>chief, and the arch-conspirator. He says, 'Workingmen, to arms ! ' What
</p>
<p>does Fischer say? Why, he says : ' Workjngmen, to arms,' Tn his circular,
</p>
<p>and adds : 'Come in full force,' and it appears the next morning.
</p>
<p>"Now the circular was circulated. Who was invited to speak, gentle-
</p>
<p>men ? No one. Why ? Because they knew that if twenty-five thousand
</p>
<p>laboring men appeared at that meeting that night in the inflamed condition
</p>
<p>of this town with the results following the McCormick meeting they knew
</p>
<p>that it was the bounden duty of the police to tell those men to go home.
</p>
<p>570 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>It is in proof in this case that they expected twenty-five thousand labor-
</p>
<p>ing men there. They would not need a speaker. If there was no
</p>
<p>speaker, then there would be tumult and crowding and jostling.
</p>
<p>.Fights might occur, difficulties be precipitated, and the police inevitably
</p>
<p>would have to come. How do I know that no speakers were invited ?
</p>
<p>Spies said that Fischer invited him. From brother Foster's remarks I con-
</p>
<p>clude that he has been on the stump a good many years out in Iowa. I
</p>
<p>venture to say he never went*to a public meeting in his life, where he ad-
</p>
<p>dressed it, where great crowds were assembled, where talking was to be
</p>
<p>indulged in, without asking his invitor who else was going to speak. It
</p>
<p>don't appear in proof here that Fischer was ever asked that question.
</p>
<p>Spies was to speak in German, and that is the reason he didn't hurry to
</p>
<p>the meeting. Fischer, Spies says, invited him to speak. Well, he was in-
</p>
<p>vited to speak, and nobo'iy else and he has never said anything about
</p>
<p>anybody else having been invited not a syllable, not a name given. In fact,
</p>
<p>every other individua' that could be invited had gone elsewhere, had pre-
</p>
<p>pared his alibi, had arranged for the meeting at the Arbeiter-Zeitung office,
</p>
<p>at the American group ; every other speaker was there, but Spies alone was
</p>
<p>invited to speak, he says, and yet he waits, he waits after getting to that
</p>
<p>meeting. He does that which the design showed clearly was the intention
</p>
<p>to do, to precipitate a difficulty at the Haymarket meeting, and to gain
</p>
<p>results by armed men and dynamite early in the evening, and then would
</p>
<p>destruction and chaos come.
</p>
<p>"The first words of Spies' opening speech demonstrate a significant
</p>
<p>thing. Why should Spies open the meeting ? Why didn't Fischer open it ?
</p>
<p>Why didn't the executive committee open it ? Spies opened it. After idling
</p>
<p>around there some time in regard to the matter, Spies opened the meeting.
</p>
<p>Had anybody asked him to open the meeting ? Why, no. He was only an
</p>
<p>ordinary invited speaker at a meeting at which no other speaker had been
</p>
<p>invited, and he appears there, and the first words he says, as I will show you
</p>
<p>by English's testimony, are : ' Mr. Parsons and Mr. Fielden will be here in
</p>
<p>a very short time to address you.' How did he know where they were ?
</p>
<p>He had not seen them. There is no indication that he had seen Parsons
</p>
<p>that day. How did he know that Parsons was not in Cincinnati ? ' Parsons

</p>
<p>and Fielden will be here in a few moments.' How do you know, Mr. Spies ?
</p>
<p>Why, they are over at the Alarm office, or at the Arbciter-Zeitung office, and
</p>
<p>Balthasar Rau is sent over there to get them.
</p>
<p>"And now, Belthasar Rau went from this meeting over to the Alarm
</p>
<p>office, the Arbeiter-Zeitung office, and invited those two people to come over
</p>
<p>there, that Spies wanted some help. Why did he want help ? Well, the
</p>
<p>meeting was not big enough. It was going to dissolve ; it looked as though
</p>
<p>it was going to pieces; the thing was a fiasco ; he had got to keep it try
</p>
<p>and see if he could not do something. And he continued, holding the
</p>
<p>audience till help came, and said : ' I will say, however, first, that this
</p>
<p>meeting was called for the purpose of discussing the general situation of the
</p>
<p>eight-hour strike, and the events which have taken place during the last
</p>
<p>forty-eight hours. It seems to have been the opinion of the authorities that
</p>
<p>this meeting had been called for the purpose of raising a little row and
</p>
<p>disturbance.'
</p>
<p>"Now, how did Spies know that the authorities knew anything about it ?
</p>
<p>Had Spies told them that there was going to be a row ? Oh, no ; he said
</p>
<p>nothing of that kind ; but he said deliberately in that meeting that the
</p>
<p>THE "PEACEABLE" MEETING. 571
</p>
<p>authorities are supposed to believe or know that a riot is going to take place
</p>
<p>right there. Had the ' Revenge ' circular been circulated ? Yes. Had
</p>
<p>the other circular been circulated ? Yes. What was their purpose ? To
</p>
<p>make a row. Spies knew it, and he hedges in his inflammatory utterances
</p>
<p>which you read between the lines. It is a Mark Antony style of oratory
</p>
<p>inflames most when there is least said. He was lying about the Gatling
</p>
<p>guns and the police, all for inflaming purposes, discussing that McCormick
</p>
<p>matter, about which he had in the inception begun to lie, for the same pur-
</p>
<p>pose. That was a very significant opening. It shows that he knew the
</p>
<p>purposes and object of that meeting. Gentlemen, it was the duty of the
</p>
<p>police to have disturbed and broken up that meeting in its inception.
</p>
<p>Why? The whole town was aflame. You remember it. Riot had occurred
</p>
<p>the day before, and the calling of a meeting upon so public a place as that
</p>
<p>was ill-advised and ought not to have been done. And the police, if they
</p>
<p>had walked down there thus early in the evening and dispersed it, would
</p>
<p>have done what was right. But the police did not walk down there and
</p>
<p>disturb the meeting; they walked down there and asked the meeting to dis-
</p>
<p>perse. There is no use of talking about proof, gentlemen. Their belts
</p>
<p>were on, their clubs in their sockets, their pistols in their pockets. That is
</p>
<p>the fact. They marched down that street, not with the precipitation which
</p>
<p>they would have you believe. They marched down that street perhaps fast,
</p>
<p>but not with precipitation, not with haste. They marched down that street
</p>
<p>to disperse a meeting that had talked 'To arms ; ' that had said : 'Throttle
</p>
<p>the law,' and that had said enough to have caused bloodshed then and
</p>
<p>there, and the only reason that more lives were not lost is because they
</p>
<p>failed to come earlier. The arrangement of that meeting was that it should
</p>
<p>be called, and that they should come early, and that it should be precipi-
</p>
<p>tated, and blood would flow. Engel was there in the evening ; he knew
</p>
<p>about it. Fischer walked up with Waller, and Waller was armed. ' Work-
</p>
<p>ingmen, come armed.' A word, gentlemen, only a word, about the break-
</p>
<p>ing-up of that meeting. They have played Harrison in and out of this case,
</p>
<p>for the purpose of saving the defendants. Harrison, you remember, went
</p>
<p>there for the purpose of ascertaining if that meeting was organized to attack
</p>
<p>the freight-house of the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad, about which you

</p>
<p>remember there was some difficulty, or McCormick's, or if it was called to
</p>
<p>attack any particular place. He found, from the speeches, that, although
</p>
<p>inflammatory and he said so from the speeches themselves he found that
</p>
<p>no particular place was pointed out for an attack.
</p>
<p>" It was the same old speeches riot, bloodshed, the black flag, the red
</p>
<p>flag, dynamite, war, to arms. And counsel upon the other side say that that
</p>
<p>'To arms! To arms!' didn't mean anything. It was Pickwickian, and
</p>
<p>used to round a sentence. They went down to that meeting, and Harrison
</p>
<p>was there and saw that meeting and heard those speeches, and reported
</p>
<p>back to Bonfield what had been the result, namely, that they had ceased to
</p>
<p>become inflammatory since they had seen his face.
</p>
<p>" Thinking that the meeting was organized for plunder at the freight-
</p>
<p>house, hearing the speeches, seeing them become more moderate, Harrison
</p>
<p>left, and after he is gone, then come the reports, the incendiary character
</p>
<p>still increased, and when they come, they come in such shape that if Bon-
</p>
<p>field had not gone down there, then and there, he would have failed to per-
</p>
<p>form his duty.
</p>
<p>" We have had enough of this. It is time it stopped. They were asked
</p>
<p>572 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>peaceably to disperse peaceably to disperse peaceably to disperse.
</p>
<p>The police had their clubs in their belts, their pistols in their belts, and the
</p>
<p>bomb was thrown. So say Bonfield, Wessler, Foley, Bowler, Hanley, Ward,
</p>
<p>Hubbard, Haas, Hull, Heinemann and I want to suggest a word about
</p>
<p>Heinemann's testimony. Heinemann said that when that bomb exploded
</p>
<p>he was getting away on the east side of the street, going south. What did
</p>
<p>he get ? He got the whistling of bullets past his ear. Where did they come
</p>
<p>from ? Where could they come from ? Hull was on that platform up there,
</p>
<p>and Owen was there, and that is where Simonson was. Hull says firing
</p>
<p>began by the crowd. Well, Owen got hit up there. It had to come from
</p>
<p>over there. Dr. Newman says that all sizes of bullets were found, from
</p>
<p>twenty-two to forty-four, and the police did not have anything but thirty-
</p>
<p>eight caliber. That was a cruel thrust for counsel to make at men standing
</p>
<p>up as these men did that night death in their midst standing there so
</p>
<p>nobly a thrust to save the lives or the liberty of the defendants by saying
</p>
<p>that they shot each other in their fright and terror. As Wirt Dexter said in
</p>
<p>a speech about that matter I wish I could deliver his words to you in
</p>
<p>praising the act of the police in that transaction : How noble was their con-
</p>
<p>duct ! Instead of fleeing and running, they said : 'Fall in, boys,' and the
</p>
<p>city was saved. Supposing the police had fired first, after the bomb. The
</p>
<p>man who threw that bomb obtained it from Lingg or Spies, and threw it in
</p>
<p>accordance with the general plan of conspiracy, and death was the result.
</p>
<p>I cannot talk to you about families, about wives and children, but if I had
</p>
<p>the power I would like to take you all over there to the Haymarket that
</p>
<p>night, and with you, with tears in your eyes, see the dead and mingle with
</p>
<p>the wounded, the dying see law violated, and then I could, if I had the
</p>
<p>power, paint you a. picture that would steel your hearts against the defend-
</p>
<p>ants. Captain Black said, in argument to you, that the State had no right
</p>
<p>to do that. The State has all the rights that it could possibly possess
</p>
<p>through so weak an instrument as myself. He has no more right. Did
</p>
<p>Fielden shoot ? I think so. If he did not, he is made of poorer clay than
</p>
<p>I take him to be. He has been saying for years : ' The bloodhounds of the
</p>
<p>police should be massacred and killed.' He it was who said that he would
</p>
<p>march with the black flag down Michigan Avenue and strike terror to the

<p>heart of the capitalist. He it is who has said, day in and day out, since
</p>
<p>living in this inhospitable country : ' Death to the police and the capitalists
</p>
<p>the despoilers our despoilers death to them ! '
</p>
<p>" Why, do you mean to say that he would not do what he says he would
</p>
<p>do ? Dr. Epler swears that he told him when he dressed the wound that
</p>
<p>he was shot when he was down on the pavement, and he has not denied
</p>
<p>it. That was a significant fact, gentlemen ; a very significant fact. The
</p>
<p>officer who was shot thinks it was by Fielden. I-t may have been by some-
</p>
<p>body else ; nobody can tell.
</p>
<p>"Another thing. One of the officers swears that he was wounded in
</p>
<p>the knee. I was not looking at Capt. Black when he motioned to you the
</p>
<p>place where the wound occurred. For the purpose of correcting myself
</p>
<p>and making no mistake about it, because the testimony of an officer or any
</p>
<p>witness who put his finger on the spot cannot get into the record ; and I
</p>
<p>found by looking at the record that he pointed his finger 'here and here.'
</p>
<p>Of course there was no significance to that. So I saw the wound again. I
</p>
<p>had seen it once before. The bullet went in there (indicating), and came out
</p>
<p>above, going around up opposite the knee-cap, and was not from behind.
</p>
<p>WITNESSES IN PAIRS. 573
</p>
<p>"That bomb was thrown in furtherance of a common design. No mat-
</p>
<p>ter who threw it. But the gentlemen say there can be no conviction in
</p>
<p>this case because we have failed to prove, or cannot prove, who threw that
</p>
<p>identical bomb. That is not the law, as I explained to you yesterday. The
</p>
<p>other question is, Is there anything in this case showing who did ? Gilmer
</p>
<p>says that he was in the alley, and a match was lighted, and that bomb was
</p>
<p>thrown by one man ; Fischer stood by, and that Spies lighted it. Is that
</p>
<p>remarkable ? Spies had been advising the doing of that thing for years ;
</p>
<p>and in one of the articles that has been read to you, over his own signature,
</p>
<p>he says : ' Take as few people into your confidence as possible ; do it alone ;
</p>
<p>in your revolutionary deeds, do it alone ; but if you have to consult any-
</p>
<p>body, take your nearest friend, a man you can rely upon.' Who is Schnau-
</p>
<p>belt ? Schwab's brother-in-law. Who is Fischer ? A man who got the
</p>
<p>meeting up at Spies' instance, and works for Spies. Now, gentlemen, I
</p>
<p>presume, and I have no doubt but what if they had raked a little more care-
</p>
<p>fully, we would have found the man that said that that bomb was thrown
</p>
<p>from the top of Crane's building ; you could have found the man that said
</p>
<p>it came from away in the alley ; any number of men probably would have
</p>
<p>put it north of the alley, and some south. The question here is, about
</p>
<p>where did it come from ? The explanation of street warfare is, that it is to
</p>
<p>be done near alleys. Is Spies so craven now, after the deed is done, that
</p>
<p>he shall say, ' I had no hand in it,' when he had advised it for years ?
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, men's lives speak for themselves. He has advised it, said it,
</p>
<p>talked it, acted it. Why, the witnesses say, counsel upon the other side say
</p>
<p>to you, ' Gentlemen, it is impossible that this man would do it, because no
</p>
<p>man saw the light which would have flashed up in their faces.' Why, gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, they put two witnesses on the stand to swear distinctly and clearly
</p>
<p>and positively that they had lighted a match and lighted a pipe, which
</p>
<p>would take a good deal longer than lighting a fuse. Spies says in one
</p>
<p>article : ' It never goes out in a dry night; the Anarchist fuse never fails.'
</p>
<p>It could have happened ; it has been advised to "-^ppen precisely as Gilmer
</p>
<p>states it. Ignore Gilmer, and the case is maae. But they want you to
</p>
<p>ignore Thompson too. Why? What for? Because they heard Schwab
</p>
<p>and Spies talk together. Was there anything marvelous in that? Had

</p>
<p>they said anything there together that they had not been saying in public
</p>
<p>for years? But supposing you ignore Thompson's testimony and say that
</p>
<p>Thompson is mistaken ; then it was Schnaubelt, wasn't it ? Why was
</p>
<p>Spies so confidential with Schnaubelt that night ? Where is Schnaubelt ?
</p>
<p>He was the man that was arrested before the conspiracy was known, and
</p>
<p>let go ; shaved his whiskers off, changed his appearance, and he has not
</p>
<p>been seen since. Why was Spies so confidential with Schnaubelt ? He
</p>
<p>says he did walk with him ; says that Henry Spies walked behind him.
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen, let me show you the testimony of these people in pairs. It
</p>
<p>is the most marvelous thing I ever saw in a lawsuit. Ferguson and Glea-
</p>
<p>son were together. They went in pairs. You remember it. Ferguson
</p>
<p>says that he was on the corner of Randolph Street when the bomb was
</p>
<p>thrown. Gleason says that was not so ; they were away down next to the
</p>
<p>station, more than half a block away. Ferguson says that they heard a
</p>
<p>crash like the breaking of a plank or a pistol, and then the bomb exploded.
</p>
<p>That is when he was on the corner of the street. Gleason says that was
</p>
<p>not so ; he didn't remember of hearing anything of that kind, but they both
</p>
<p>distinctly remembered of seeing, after the bomb was exploded, the police
</p>
<p>574 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>fire from that way. The Anarchists fired south, the police north. Fer-
</p>
<p>guson and Gleason were south of and behind the police, yet they say the
</p>
<p>police fired south, while facing north. Ridiculous. And one or the other
</p>
<p>of them, I don't know or it was Taylor says that they, the police, fired
</p>
<p>clear down to Madison Street, and along Madison Street. Queer that
</p>
<p>nobody else heard of that. What were they shooting down there for ?
</p>
<p>Richter and Liniger you remember them these are the two loving
</p>
<p>friends that went to that meeting pursuant to the notice that they saw in
</p>
<p>the Arbeiter-Zeitung not only the notice of the meeting, but the Arbeiter-
</p>
<p>Zeitung contained the ' Revenge ' circular. They went to that meeting and
</p>
<p>lovingly stood in the alley, midway between the edge of the walk and the
</p>
<p>building, arm in arm, for over an hour. Foster knew that that was ridic-
</p>
<p>ulous, and he tried to get them apart ; he asked them questions to get them
</p>
<p>apart, but they clung together for over an hour, and finally moved up to
</p>
<p>the lamp-post, where Taylor had been standing before the meeting began,
</p>
<p>and they didn't know where the meeting was to be.
</p>
<p>" Again Krumm stood in the alley with his back to the wall all the time
</p>
<p>except when he lighted his pipe and walked backward and forward in it,
</p>
<p>Albright standing with him. Krumm had his back up against that wall,
</p>
<p>glued like a post for almost an hour, saving only at intervals did he leave
</p>
<p>it ; and Krumm and Albright lighted their pipes, and they moved to the
</p>
<p>lamp-post. The lamp-post was peopled thick. Gentlemen, it is an insult
</p>
<p>to your intelligence to suggest a word about the truth of that Krumm and
</p>
<p>Albright's testimony. Why, Krumm is the man that left his boarding-
</p>
<p>house, boarding with Albright at that time left his house in search of a
</p>
<p>friend whose name he could not give ; if he could it was indefinite and
</p>
<p>that he was to meet him on the corner of Canal and Randolph Streets that
</p>
<p>night somewhere. He went down to Canal and Randolph Streets, wan-
</p>
<p>dered around there looking for his friend, or for somebody who said he would
</p>
<p>meet him there, and then walked back to the meeting and began to look
</p>
<p>for Albright, or at least he found Albright. Now, isn't that a queer
</p>
<p>circumstance that they neither of them knew that that meeting was
</p>
<p>going to happen, or knew that the other was to be there ; left the house
</p>
<p>about the same time, and yet did not leave together, and happened to meet

</p>
<p>right in that alley, with their backs up against the wall? The next pair is
</p>
<p>Fischer and Wandry. That is for the alibi. Now, why doesn't Spies, who
</p>
<p>was on the stand, who says he was in Zepf's, say something about Fischer
</p>
<p>being there. Why wasn't Waller, who was on the stand, asked by these
</p>
<p>men whether Fischer was there ? The witnesses all congregate at this
</p>
<p>place, at Zepf's Hall, after the meeting, and Fischer has not been seen by
</p>
<p>anybody, except Wandry. Even this respectable Nihilist from Russia don't
</p>
<p>remember of seeing Fischer, and got Fischer in a great many different
</p>
<p>places, as they do Parsons. Finding Parsons had got to be in several places,
</p>
<p>and further, finding that they have got him down in the window, they get
</p>
<p>another man there that looks like Parsons - as they did Krumm, who lighted
</p>
<p>his pipe in the alley and looked so much like Spies. To digress a moment,
</p>
<p>Mr. Walker never said to you, gentlemen, that the defendants' lawyers put
</p>
<p>up Mr. Krumm because of his resemblance to Spies and to account for a
</p>
<p>light in the alley. That was not fair. He made the declaration that the
</p>
<p>other side, or somebody, had put up the job.
</p>
<p>"We have endeavored to try this lawsuit like gentlemen. I think we
</p>
<p>have succeeded on both sides. There was not that implication to be
</p>
<p>NEGATIVE PROOF ANALYZED. 575
</p>
<p>drawn from what Walker said, but it was rather ingenious and sagacious
</p>
<p>to allow you, gentlemen, to believe that we had been saying something that
</p>
<p>was unfair.
</p>
<p>"The two men that saw Schnaubelt Lehnert and Krueger. That was
</p>
<p>the queerest circumstance that I have yet come across. By the way, Krue-
</p>
<p>ger was in the conspiracy, was in both the meetings, with Schnaubelt, with
</p>
<p>Waller, with Engel, with Lingg ; he was there, knew them all, and, although
</p>
<p>he was on the stand, the gentlemen upon the other side never asked him
</p>
<p>nor Grueneberg a question about the conspiracy. Neither did they ask
</p>
<p>Spies, or Parsons, or Schwab. They did ask Fielden.
</p>
<p>" August Krueger and Lehnert got this man some twenty or thirty feet
</p>
<p>away from the alley and the wagon, talking in a quiet tone of voice about
</p>
<p>going home. They walk a little ways together. Krueger goes one direc-
</p>
<p>tion and Schnaubelt another. Black tells you that the reason of that was
</p>
<p>because they could not go together any further, as their places diverged.
</p>
<p>It would not have done for them to have gone together any further, because
</p>
<p>Krueger went to Engel's. There were too many at Engel's it would not
</p>
<p>have done.
</p>
<p>" I believe that Schnaubelt threw the bomb. You may believe that it
</p>
<p>is an unknown person threw it ; it is immaterial.
</p>
<p>"Back and Mitlacher. Back, if I remember, is the man that appeared
</p>
<p>at the Arbeiter-Zeitung office that Tuesday night, at the time of the meeting
</p>
<p>of the American group. Now, what was he there for? He was a member
</p>
<p>of some other group. At all events he was there, and a German ; he was
</p>
<p>not an American ; he had not been here long enough, to start with, and he
</p>
<p>didn't look as if he ever wanted to be one of our kind.
</p>
<p>" Now, where did these two men stand ? They stood on the platform,
</p>
<p>next to the plumber's shop, on the south side of the alley, and at least
</p>
<p>thirty-five or forty feet from where that wagon was ; yet those men, one of
</p>
<p>them, the tall man, says that he distinctly remembers seeing Henry Spies.
</p>
<p>Why, it was a dark night, and the man couldn't see from there. And the
</p>
<p>other fellow saw Henry Spies' hat. They stood there all the evening,
</p>
<p>nearly ; walked up and down once in a while ; stood there all the evening.
</p>
<p>That is another ridiculous suggestion.

<p>" This alibi business and this suggestion of these pairs, couples, consti-
</p>
<p>tute what Black calls proof. That is right. It is negative, and a very poor
</p>
<p>negative at that. He says that that is all you could prove. Didn't see any-
</p>
<p>thing, of course.
</p>
<p>" My attention is brought to another fact. Captain Black made a mis-
</p>
<p>take. I put it that way. He read Thompson's testimony to you. Your
</p>
<p>(i. f., Captain Black's) shorthand writer has either made a mistake, or your
</p>
<p>typewriter has. Thompson did not change, in his answers, from Spies to
</p>
<p>Schwab.
</p>
<p>" In regard to the testimony of Thompson, gentlemen, it was a remark-
</p>
<p>able feature of the case that he stood that searching cross-examination with
</p>
<p>such splendid equanimity, and no disturbance of what he said. And, gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, that same can be said of Gilmer. Let any of you go onto that
</p>
<p>witness-stand, and let the sagacious, clear-headed Foster hammer away at
</p>
<p>you two hours and a half, over some little fact, and you would see where
</p>
<p>you would be. I could not stand it. There is not one man in a thousand
</p>
<p>that could. And it is nothing against a man's character in the city of Chi-
</p>
<p>cago that those that know well of him do not know where he lives. I do
</p>
<p>576 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>not believe that one of you gentlemen knows where I live, or where Foster
</p>
<p>lives, or where Black lives. It is nothing against a man that his employer
</p>
<p>sometimes speaks well of him.
</p>
<p>" I have my attention brought I had almost forgotten it to a pecul-
</p>
<p>iar circumstance about this case, and the most significant of anything that
</p>
<p>I have seen in it. When Spies was arrested he left the traces of his crime
</p>
<p>in his office. Free speech had become so common to him free speech, as
</p>
<p>they call it in this case, had become so remarkably liberal that he feared
</p>
<p>nothing. Bonfield came in and arrested him. He goes over to Ebersold.
</p>
<p>Ebersold, in his indignation, characterizes the crowd as you heard it here,
</p>
<p>and Spies says, upon the witness-stand, that he unsuspectingly went over
</p>
<p>there. If he had had his senses about him, he would have destroyed
</p>
<p>' Ruhe,' the manuscript, and everything of that character, and no traces
</p>
<p>autonomous traces would be left.
</p>
<p>" In speaking of ' Ruhe,' I want to speak of another thing. Spies said
</p>
<p>that he received a communication that he was to put in prominent letters
</p>
<p>in the Letter-box. Now, the bare fact of putting it in the Letter-box is as
</p>
<p>prominent as it could be. It is separate and distinct. Let us see how he
</p>
<p>puts it. He puts it in the Letter-box, marks a double line under it, which
</p>
<p>means big letters, puts in an exclamation point at the other end, and inserts
</p>
<p>it. That makes it prominent, sure. Now, what does he say about it ? He
</p>
<p>unsuspectingly leaves the traces of his crime ; and there never was a crim-
</p>
<p>inal, great or small, in the world, but that somewhere, at some time, com-
</p>
<p>mitted a mistake. It is the little mistakes, the plain, noticeable mistakes
</p>
<p>that they make, which serve for detection. ' Ruhe ' appears, and he says he
</p>
<p>supposed that it was some labor organization. The idea ! Why, his labor
</p>
<p>organizations are all distinct and plain. It says : ' This organization meets
</p>
<p>so-and-so. That organization meets so and so.' The paper speaks for
</p>
<p>itself. Talk about a labor organization putting in such a word as that
</p>
<p>' Ruhe.' whose significance is peace, quiet and rest, but which meant war
</p>
<p>and bloodshed !
</p>
<p>" The police did not wait any too long. It has been done enough in
</p>
<p>this town. It is time that we American citizens awoke to a full realization
</p>
<p>of the importance of liberty and freedom of speech, and that freedom of

</p>
<p>speech does not mean license to preach murder, to preach assassination, to
</p>
<p>prceah crime and the perpetration of it. That is not free speech. A man
</p>
<p>who does that is answerable for it, and for the result of his preaching, the
</p>
<p>result of his words. If it results in crime, he is responsible himself. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, that is the law. I have gone over this case perhaps more in extenso
</p>
<p>than I intended ; more perhaps than you desire to listen to ; I am through.
</p>
<p>Your duty is about to begin. I felt relieved when you were selected. Some
</p>
<p>of the great responsibility that has rested upon my shoulders I felt I could
</p>
<p>place upon yours. It has been placed there. Gentlemen, the responsibility
</p>
<p>is great. You have to answer yourselves, under your oaths, to the people of
</p>
<p>the State, not to me. My duty is performed, and yours begins, and in this
</p>
<p>connection, gentlemen, let me suggest to you another reason why it is im-
</p>
<p>portant that you should be careful. You can acquit them all, one, or none ;
</p>
<p>you can distribute the penalties as you please. To some you can administer
</p>
<p>the extreme penalty of the law ; to others less than that, if you desire. To
</p>
<p>some you can give life, administer punishment if you desire ; to some, years
</p>
<p>of punishment.
</p>
<p>" I have a word to say in this connection about Neebe. The testimony
</p>
<p>GRINNELLS CLOSING APPEAL. 577
</p>
<p>has been analyzed, the testimony in regard to his connection with the
</p>
<p>Arbeiter-Zeitung office ; his connection with these people from time to time,
</p>
<p>the evidence that when he saw the dynamite in the Arbeiter-Zeitung office on
</p>
<p>that morning when it was discovered there, which these men so infamously
</p>
<p>suggest was put there by the police but I have not argued that question;
</p>
<p>it looks so insulting to a man's intelligence. If that had been so, if it was
</p>
<p>not there and did not belong there, they could have brought Lizius here.
</p>
<p>His name is on the back of the indictment. They could have brought all
</p>
<p>the employes of the office here. What did Neebe say about the dynamite ?
</p>
<p>Why, he said it was stuff to clean type with, he guessed ; and he circulated,
</p>
<p>not two circulars, but a lot of them. Gentlemen, I am not here to ask you to
</p>
<p>take the life of Oscar Neebe on this proof. I shall ask you to do nothing in
</p>
<p>this case that I feel I would not do myself were I seated in your chairs.
</p>
<p>" This case is greater than us all, more important to the country than
</p>
<p>you conceive ; the case itself and what it involves is more important than
</p>
<p>all their lives, than all the lives of the unfortunate officers who bit the dust
</p>
<p>that night in defense of our laws.
</p>
<p>" Some of these people, we sincerely and honestly believe, should receive
</p>
<p>at your hands the extreme penalty of the law. Spies, Fischer, Lingg,
</p>
<p>Engel, Fielden, Parsons, Schwab, Neebe, in my opinion, based upon the
</p>
<p>proof, is the order of the punishment. It is for you to say what it shall be.
</p>
<p>You have been importuned, gentlemen, to disagree. Don't do that; don't
</p>
<p>do that. If, in your judgments, in the judgment of some of you, some of
</p>
<p>these men should suffer death, and others think a less punishment would
</p>
<p>subserve the law, don't stand on that, but agree on something. It is no
</p>
<p>pleasant task for me to ask the life of any man. Personally I have not a
</p>
<p>word to say against these men. As a representative of the law I say to
</p>
<p>you, the law demands now, here, its power. Regardless of me, of Foster,
</p>
<p>of Black, or of us all, that law which the exponents of Anarchy violated to
</p>
<p>kill Lincoln and Garfield, that law that has made us strong to-day, and
</p>
<p>which you have sworn to obey, demands of you a punishment of these men.
</p>
<p>Don't do it because I ask you. Do it, if it should be done, because the
</p>
<p>law demands it. You stand between the living and the dead. You stand
</p>
<p>between law and violated law. Do your duty courageously, even if that

<p>The Instructions to the Jury What Murder Is Free Speech and its

<p>Abuse The Theory of Conspiracy Value of Circumstantial Evidence Meaning of
</p>
<p>a " Reasonable Doubt" What a Jury May Decide Waiting for the Verdict " Guilty
</p>
<p>of Murder " The Death Penalty Adjudged Neebe's Good Luck Motion for a New
</p>
<p>Trial Affidavits about the Jury The Motion Overruled.
</p>
<p>ON the conclusion of State's Attorney Grinnell's review of the argu-
</p>
<p>ments made by the defense, Judge Gary proceeded to charge the
</p>
<p>jury. The hour was after the noon recess of Thursday, August 19, and the
</p>
<p>presentation and reading of the instructions consumed a goodly portion of
</p>
<p>the afternoon. When the court had finished the jury retired, and the fate of
</p>
<p>eight men was in their hands.
</p>
<p>The instructions given were as follows on behalf of the people :
</p>
<p>" The court instructs the jury, in the language of the statute, that murder
</p>
<p>is the unlawful killing of a human being in the peace of the people, with
</p>
<p>malice aforethought, either expressed or implied. An unlawful killing may-
</p>
<p>be perpetrated by poisoning, striking, starving, drowning, stabbing, shoot-
</p>
<p>ing, or by any other of the various forms or means by which human nature
</p>
<p>may be overcome, and death thereby occasioned.
</p>
<p>"Express malice is that deliberate intention unlawfully to take away the
</p>
<p>life of a fellow-creature which is manifested by external circumstances cap-
</p>
<p>able of proof. Malice shall be implied when no considerable provocation
</p>
<p>appears, or when all the circumstances of the killing show an abandoned
</p>
<p>and malignant heart.
</p>
<p>"The court instructs the jury that whoever is guilty of murder shall
</p>
<p>suffer the penalty of death or imprisonment in the penitentiary for his
</p>
<p>natural life, or for a term not less than fourteen years. If the accused or
</p>
<p>any of them are found guilty by the jury, the jury shall fix the punishment
</p>
<p>by their verdict.
</p>
<p>" The court instructs the jury that, while it is provided by the Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion of the State of Illinois that every person may freely speak, write and
</p>
<p>publish on all subjects, he is, by the Constitution, held responsible under
</p>
<p>the laws for the abuse of liberty so given. Freedom of speech is limited by
</p>
<p>the laws of the land, to the extent, among other limitations, that no man is
</p>
<p>allowed to advise the committing of any crime against the person or prop-

<p>erty of another ; and the statute provides : An accessory is he who stands
</p>
<p>by and aids, abets and assists, or who, not being present, aiding, abetting or
</p>
<p>assisting, hath advised, encouraged, aided or abetted the perpetration of
</p>
<p>the crime. He who thus aids, abets, assists, advises or encourages, shall
</p>
<p>be considered as principal, and punished accordingly.
</p>
<p>"Every such accessory, when the crime is committed within or without
</p>
<p>this State by his aid or procurement in this State, may be indicted and con-
</p>
<p>victed at the same time as the principal, or before or after his conviction,
</p>
<p>whether the principal is convicted or amenable to justice or not, and pun-
</p>
<p>ished as principal.
</p>
<p>578
</p>
<p>THE COURT'S INSTRUCTIONS. 579
</p>
<p>" The court further instructs the jury, as a matter of law, that if they be-
</p>
<p>lieve from the evidence in this case, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the
</p>
<p>defendants, or any of them, conspired and agreed together, or with others,
</p>
<p>to overthrow the law by force, or to unlawfully resist the officers of the law,
</p>
<p>and if they further believe from the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt,
</p>
<p>that, in pursuance of such conspiracy and in furtherance of the common ob-
</p>
<p>ject, a bomb was thrown by a member of such conspiracy at the time, and
</p>
<p>that Mathias J. Degan was killed, then such of the defendants that the jury
</p>
<p>believe from the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, to have been parties
</p>
<p>to such conspiracy, are guilty of murder, whether present at the killing or
</p>
<p>not, and whether the identity of the person throwing the bomb be estab-
</p>
<p>lished or not.
</p>
<p>" If the jury believe from the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that
</p>
<p>there was in existence in this county and State a conspiracy to overthrow the
</p>
<p>existing order of society, and to bring about social revolution by force, or
</p>
<p>to destroy the legal authorities of this city, county or State by force, and
</p>
<p>that the defendants, or any of them, were parties to such conspiracy, and
</p>
<p>that Degan was killed in the manner described in the indictment, that he
</p>
<p>was killed by a bomb, and that the bomb was thrown by a party to the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, and in furtherance of the objects of the conspiracy, then any of the
</p>
<p>defendants who were members of such conspiracy at that time are in this
</p>
<p>case guilty of murder, and that, too, although the jury may further believe
</p>
<p>from the evidence that the time and place for the bringing about of such
</p>
<p>revolution, or the destruction of such authorities, had not been definitely,
</p>
<p>agreed upon by the conspirators, but was left to them and the exigencies of
</p>
<p>time, or to the judgment of any of the co-conspirators."
</p>
<p>" If these defendants, or any two or more of them, conspired together
</p>
<p>with or not with any other person or persons to excite the people or classes
</p>
<p>of the people of this city to sedition, tumult and riot, to use deadly weapons
</p>
<p>against and take the lives of other persons, as a means to carry their
</p>
<p>designs and purposes into effect, and in pursuance of such conspiracy, and
</p>
<p>in furtherance of its objects, any of the persons so conspiring publicly, by
</p>
<p>print or speech, advised or encouraged the commission of murder without
</p>
<p>designating time, place or occasion at which it should be done, and in pur-

</p>
<p>suance of, and induced by such advice or encouragement, murder was com-
</p>
<p>mitted, then all of such conspirators are guilty of such murder, whether
</p>
<p>the person who perpetrated such murder can be identified or not. If such
</p>
<p>murder was committed in pursuance of such advice or encouragement, and
</p>
<p>was induced thereby, it does not matter what change, if any, in the order
</p>
<p>or condition of society, or what, if any, advantage to themselves or
</p>
<p>others the conspirators proposed as the result of their conspiracy,
</p>
<p>nor does it matter whether such advice and encouragement had
</p>
<p>been frequent and long continued or not, except in determining whether
</p>
<p>the perpetrator was or was not acting in pursuance of such advice
</p>
<p>or encouragement, and was or was not induced thereby to commit the mur-
</p>
<p>der. If there was such conspiracy as in this instruction is recited, such
</p>
<p>advice or encouragement was given, and murder committed in pursuance of
</p>
<p>and induced thereby, then all such conspirators are guilty of murder. Nor
</p>
<p>does it matter, if there was such a conspiracy, how impracticable or impos-
</p>
<p>sible of success its end and aims were, nor how foolish or ill-arranged
</p>
<p>were the plans for its execution, except as bearing upon the question
</p>
<p>whether there was or was not such conspiracy.
</p>
<p>580 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>"The court instructs the jury that a conspiracy may be established by
</p>
<p>circumstantial evidence the same as any other fact, and that such evidence
</p>
<p>is legal and competent for that purpose. So also whether an act which
</p>
<p>was committed was done by a member of the conspiracy, may be established
</p>
<p>by circumstantial evidence, whether the identity of the individual who com-
</p>
<p>mitted the act be established or not ; and also whether an act done was in
</p>
<p>pursuance of the common design may be ascertained by the same
</p>
<p>class of evidence, and if the jury believe from the evidence in
</p>
<p>this case beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants or any of them
</p>
<p>conspired and agreed together or with others to overthrow the law by force,
</p>
<p>or destroy the legal authorities of this city, county or State by force, and that
</p>
<p>in furtherance of the common design, and by a member of such conspiracy,
</p>
<p>Mathias J. Degan was killed, then these defendants, if any, whom the jury
</p>
<p>believe from the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, were parties to such
</p>
<p>conspiracy, are guilty of the murder of Mathias J. Degan, whether the
</p>
<p>identity of the individual doing the killing be established or not, or whether
</p>
<p>such defendants were present at the time of the killing or not.
</p>
<p>" The jury are instructed, as a matter of law, that all who take part in
</p>
<p>the conspiracy after it is formed, and while it is in execution, and all who
</p>
<p>with knowledge of the facts concur in the plan originally formed, and aid in
</p>
<p>executing them, are fellow-conspirators. Their concurrence without proof
</p>
<p>of an agreement to concur is conclusive against them. They commit the
</p>
<p>offense when they become parties to the transaction or further the original
</p>
<p>plan with knowledge of the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>" The court instructs the jury, as a matter of law, that circumstantial evi-
</p>
<p>dence is just as legal and just as effective as any other evidence, provided
</p>
<p>the circumstances are of such a character and force as to satisfy the minds
</p>
<p>of the jury of the defendants' guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
</p>
<p>"The court instructs the jury that what is meant by circumstantial evi-
</p>
<p>dence in criminal cases is the proof of such facts and circumstances con-
</p>
<p>nected with or surrounding the commission of the crime charged as tend
</p>
<p>to show the guilt or innocence of the party charged. And if those facts
</p>
<p>and circumstances are sufficient to satisfy the jury of the guilt of the defend-
</p>
<p>ants beyond a reasonable doubt, then such evidence is sufficient to author-

</p>
<p>ize the jury in rinding the defendants guilty.
</p>
<p>" The law exacts the conviction wherever there is sufficient legal evi-
</p>
<p>dence to show the defendants' guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and cir-
</p>
<p>cumstantial evidence is legal evidence.
</p>
<p>" The court instructs the jury, as a matter of law, that when the defend-
</p>
<p>ants August Spies, Michael Schwab, Albert R. Parsons and Samuel Fielden
</p>
<p>testified as witnesses in this case, each became the same as any other wit-
</p>
<p>ness, and the credibility of each is to be attested by and subjected to the
</p>
<p>same tests as are legally applied to any other witness ; and in determining
</p>
<p>the degree of credibility that shall be accorded to the testimony of any one
</p>
<p>of said above-named defendants, the jury have a right to take into con-
</p>
<p>sideration the fact that he is interested in the result of this prosecution, as
</p>
<p>well as his demeanor and conduct upon the witness-stand during the trial,
</p>
<p>and the jury are also to take into consideration the fact, if such is the fact,
</p>
<p>that he has been contradicted by other witnesses. And the court further
</p>
<p>instructs the jury that if, after considering all the evidence in this case,
</p>
<p>they find that any one of said defendants August Spies, Michael Schwab,
</p>
<p>Albert R. Parsons and Samuel Fielden has willfully and corruptly testified
</p>
<p>THE COURT'S INSTRUCTIONS. 581
</p>
<p>falsely to any fact material to the issue in this case, they have the right to
</p>
<p>entirely disregard his testimony, except in so far as his testimony is corrob-
</p>
<p>orated by other credible evidence.
</p>
<p>" The rule of law which clothes every person accused of crime with the
</p>
<p>presumption of innocence, and imposes upon the State the burden of estab-
</p>
<p>lishing his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, is not intended to aid any one
</p>
<p>who is in fact guilty cf crime to escape, but is a humane provision of law,
</p>
<p>intended, so far as human agencies can, to guard against the danger of any
</p>
<p>innocent person being unjustly punished.
</p>
<p>"The court instructs the jury, as a matter of law, that in considering
</p>
<p>the case the jury are not to go beyond the evidence to hunt up doubts, nor
</p>
<p>must they entertain such doubts as are merely chimerical or conjectural. A
</p>
<p>doubt, to justify an acquittal, must be reasonable, and it must arise from a
</p>
<p>candid and impartial investigation of all the evidence in the case, and unless
</p>
<p>it is such that, were the same kind of doubt interposed in the graver transac-
</p>
<p>tions of life, it would cause a reasonable and prudent man to hesitate and
</p>
<p>pause, it is insufficient to authorize a verdict of not guilty. If, after consid-
</p>
<p>ering all the evidence, you can say you have an abiding conviction of the
</p>
<p>truth of the charge, you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.
</p>
<p>"The court further instructs the jury, as a matter of law, that the doubt
</p>
<p>which the juror is allowed to retain on his own mind, and under the influ-
</p>
<p>ence of which he should frame a verdict of not guilty, must always be a
</p>
<p>reasonable one. A doubt produced by undue sensibility in the mind of any
</p>
<p>juror, in view of the consequences of his verdict, is not a reasonable doubt,
</p>
<p>and a juror is not allowed to create sources or materials of doubt by resort-
</p>
<p>ing to trivial and fanciful suppositions and remote conjectures as to possible
</p>
<p>states of fact differing from that established by the evidence. You are not
</p>
<p>at liberty to disbelieve as jurors if from the evidence you believe as men ;
</p>
<p>your oath imposes on you no obligation to doubt where no doubt would
</p>
<p>exist if no oath had been administered.
</p>
<p>" The court instructs the jury that they are the judges of the law as well
</p>
<p>as the facts in this case, and if they can say, upon their oaths, that they
</p>
<p>know the law better than the court itself, they have the right to do so ; but
</p>
<p>before assuming so solemn a responsibility, they should be assured that they

<p>are not acting from caprice or prejudice, that they are not controlled by
</p>
<p>their will or their wishes, but from a deep and confident conviction that the
</p>
<p>court is wrong and that they are right. Before saying this, upoa their
</p>
<p>oaths, it is their duty to reflect whether, from their study and experience,
</p>
<p>they are better qualified to judge of the law than the court. If, under all
</p>
<p>the circumstances, they are prepared to say that the court is wrong in its
</p>
<p>exposition of the law, the statute has given them that right.
</p>
<p>" In this case the jury may, as in their judgment the evidence warrants,
</p>
<p>find any or all of the defendants guilty or not, or all of them not guilty ; and
</p>
<p>if, in their judgment, the evidence warrants, they may, in case they find the
</p>
<p>defendants, or any of them, guilty, fix the same penalty for all the defend-
</p>
<p>ants found guilty, or different penalties for the different defendants found
</p>
<p>guilty.
</p>
<p>" In case they find the defendants, or any of them, guilty of murder, they
</p>
<p>should fix the penalty either at death or at imprisonment in the penitentiary
</p>
<p>for life, or at imprisonment in the penitentiary for a term of any number of

<p>years, not less than fourteen."

<p>better than the court.
</p>
<p>"The law presumes the defendants innocent of the charge in the indict-
</p>
<p>ment until the jury are satisfied by the evidence, beyond all reasonable
</p>
<p>doubt, of the guilt of the defendants.
</p>
<p>" If a reasonable doubt of any facts, necessary to convict the accused, is
</p>
<p>raised in the minds of the jury by the evidence itself, or by the ingenuity
</p>
<p>of counsel upon any hypothesis reasonably consistent with the evidence,
</p>
<p>that doubt is decisive in favor of the prisoners' acquittal. A verdict of
</p>
<p>not guilty simply means that the guilt of the accused has not been
</p>
<p>demonstrated in the precise, specific and narrow forms prescribed by
</p>
<p>the law.
</p>
<p>"No jury should convict anybody of crime upon mere suspicion, how-
</p>
<p>ever strong, or because there is a preponderance of all the evidence against
</p>
<p>him, but the jury must be convinced of the defendant's guilt, beyond all
</p>
<p>reasonable doubt, before they can lawfully convict.
</p>
<p>"The law does not require the defendants to prove themselves innocent,
</p>
<p>but the burden of proof that they are guilty beyond all reasonable doubt
</p>
<p>is upon the prosecution.
</p>
<p>"The indictment is of itself a mere accusation and no proof of the guilt
</p>
<p>of the defendants.
</p>
<p>"The presumption of the innocence of the defendants is not a mere
</p>
<p>form, but an essential, substantial part of the law of the land, and it is the
</p>
<p>duty of the jury to give the defendants the full benefit of this presumption
</p>
<p>in this case.
</p>
<p>"It is incumbent upon the prosecution to prove beyond all reasonable
</p>
<p>doubt every material allegation in the indictment, and unless that has been
</p>
<p>done, the jury should find the defendants not guilty.

<p>beyond all reasonable doubt, that the defendants are guilty as charged in
</p>
<p>the indictment of the murder of Mathias J. Degan ; it is the duty of the
</p>
<p>jury to acquit any of the defendants as to whom there is a failure of such
</p>
<p>proof. The jury are not at liberty to adopt any unreasonable theories
</p>
<p>or suppositions in considering the evidence in order to justify a verdict of
</p>
<p>conviction.
</p>
<p>"A reasonable doubt is that state of mind in which the jury, after con-
</p>
<p>sidering all the evidence, cannot say they feel an abiding faith, amounting
</p>
<p>to a moral certainty, from the evidence in the case, that the defendants
</p>
<p>are guilty as charged in the indictment.
</p>
<p>"The rules of evidence as to the amount of evidence in this case are
</p>
<p>different from those in a civil case ; a mere preponderance of evidence
</p>
<p>would not warrant a verdict of guilty.
</p>
<p>"Mere probability of the defendants' guilt is not sufficient to warrant a
</p>
<p>conviction.
</p>
<p>"Your personal opinions as to facts not proved cannot be the basis of

<p>"The jury are the sole judges of the credibility of witnesses, and in pass-
</p>
<p>ing thereon may consider their prejudices, motives or feelings of revenge,
</p>
<p>if any such have appeared, and if the jury believe from the evidence that
</p>
<p>any witness has knowingly or willfully testified falsely as to any material
</p>
<p>fact, they may disregard his entire testimony, unless it is corroborated by
</p>
<p>other credible evidence.
</p>
<p>" If one single fact is proved by a preponderance of the evidence which
</p>
<p>is inconsistent with the guilt of a defendant, this is sufficient to raise a
</p>
<p>reasonable doubt as to his guilt and entitles him to an acquittal. In order
</p>
<p>to justify the inference of legal guilt from circumstantial evidence, the exist-
</p>
<p>ence of the inculpatory facts must be absolutely incompatible with the
</p>
<p>innocence of the accused upon any rational theory.
</p>
<p>"The witnesses Gottfried Waller and Wilhelm Seliger are accom-
</p>
<p>plices, and while a person accused of crime may be convicted upon the
</p>
<p>uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, still the jury should weigh it
</p>
<p>with great care and caution, and convict upon it only if they are satisfied
</p>
<p>beyond any reasonable doubt of its truth.
</p>
<p>" If you believe from the evidence that the witnesses Gottfried Waller
</p>
<p>and Wilhelm Seliger were induced to become witnesses by any promise of
</p>
<p>immunity from punishment, or by any hope held out to them, that it would
</p>
<p>go easier with them in case they disclosed who their confederates were, or
</p>
<p>in case they implicated some one else in the crime, then you should take

</p>
<p>to mistake or misrecollection rather than to a willful intention to swear
</p>
<p>falsely, if you can reasonably do so under the evidence.
</p>
<p>"The jury should fairly and impartially consider the testimony of the
</p>
<p>defendants, together with all the other evidence.
</p>
<p>" If the verbal admission of a defendant is offered in evidence, the whole
</p>
<p>of the admission must be taken together, and those parts which are in favor
</p>
<p>of the defendant are entitled to as much consideration as any other parts,
</p>
<p>unless disproved, or apparently improbable or untrue, when considered with
</p>
<p>all the other evidence.
</p>
<p>" It would be improper for the jury to regard any statements of the
</p>
<p>prosecuting attorneys, not based upon the evidence, as entitled to any weight.
</p>
<p>" If all the facts and circumstances relied on by the People to secure a
</p>
<p>conviction can be reasonably accounted for upon any theory consistent
</p>
<p>with the innocence of the defendants, or any of them, then you should
</p>
<p>acquit such of them as to whom the facts proven can thus be accounted for.

<p>crime that he contemplated the commission of such crime. If any rea-

<p>sonable hypothesis exists that such crime may have been committed by
</p>
<p>another in no way connected with the defendants, the accused should be

<p>acquitted.
</p>
<p>" If the evidence leaves a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the defendants,
</p>
<p>as charged in the indictment, the jury should acquit, although the evidence
</p>
<p>may show conduct of no less turpitude than the crime charged.
</p>
<p>" The allusions and references of the prosecuting attorneys to the sup-

<p>" Individuals and communities have the legal right to arm themselves for
</p>
<p>the defense and protection of their persons and property, and a proposition
</p>
<p>by any person, publicly proclaimed, to arm for such protection and defense,
</p>
<p>is not an offense against the laws of this State.
</p>
<p>" If the defendants, or some of them, agreed together, or with others, in
</p>
<p>the event of the workingmen or strikers being attacked, that they (defend-
</p>
<p>ants) would assist the strikers to resist such an attack, this would not con-
</p>
<p>stitute conspiracy if the anticipated attack was unjustified and illegal, and
</p>
<p>such contemplated resistance simply the opposing of force wrongfully and
</p>
<p>illegally exercised, by force sufficient to repel said assault.
</p>
<p>"The burden is not cast upon the defendants of proving that the person
</p>
<p>who threw the bomb was not acting under their advice, teaching or pro-
</p>
<p>curement. Unless the evidence proves beyond all reasonable doubt that
</p>
<p>either some of the defendants threw said bomb, or that the person who
</p>
<p>threw it acted under the advice and procurement of defendants or some of
</p>
<p>them, the defendants should be acquitted. Such advice may not necessarily

<p>be special as to the bomb, but general, so as to include it.

<p>"It is not proper for the jury to guess that the person who threw the

<p>defendants can be held liable therefor, the evidence must satisfy you
</p>
<p>beyond all reasonable doubt that the person throwing said bomb was acting
</p>
<p>as the result of the teaching or encouragement of defendants or some of
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>" Before a person charged as accessory to a crime can be convicted, the
</p>
<p>evidence must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime was com-
</p>
<p>mitted by some person acting under the advice, aid, encouragement, abet-
</p>
<p>ting or procurement of the defendant whose conviction as accessory is
</p>
<p>sought. Though you may believe from the evidence that a party in fact
</p>
<p>advised the commission in certain contingencies of acts amounting to crime,
</p>
<p>yet, if the act complained of was in fact committed by some third party of
</p>
<p>his own mere volition, hatred, malice or ill- will, and not materially influenced,
</p>
<p>either directly or indirectly, by such advice of the party charged, or any
</p>
<p>party for whose advice the defendants are responsible, the party charged
</p>
<p>would not in such case be responsible.

</p>
<p>Lake Street, at which some of the defendants were present, it was agreed

<p>that in the event of a collision between the police, militia or firemen, and the

<p>striking laborers, certain armed organizations, of which some of the defend-
</p>
<p>ants were members, should meet at certain places in Chicago, that a com-
</p>
<p>mittee should attend public places and meetings where an attack by the
</p>
<p>police and others might be expected, and in the event of such attack report
</p>
<p>the same to said organizations to the end that such attack might be resisted
</p>
<p>and the police stations of the city destroyed, still, if the evidence does not
</p>
<p>prove, beyond all reasonable doubt, that the throwing of the bomb which
</p>
<p>killed Mathias J. Degan was the result of any act in furtherance of the com-
</p>
<p>mon design herein stated, and if it may have been the unauthorized and
</p>
<p>individual act of some person acting upon his own responsibility and volition,
</p>
<p>then none of the defendants can be held responsible therefor on account of
</p>
<p>said West Lake Street meeting."
</p>
<p>Upon the conclusion of the reading of the instructions in behalf of the
</p>
<p>defendants, which were read after the instructions on behalf of the people,
</p>
<p>the court of its own motion gave to the jury the following instruction :
</p>
<p>" The statute requires that instructions by the court to the jury shall be
</p>
<p>in writing, and only relate to the law of the case.
</p>
<p>" The practice under the statute is that the counsel prepare on each
</p>
<p>side a set of instructions and present them to the court, and, if approved, to
</p>
<p>be read by the court as the law of the case. It may happen, by reason of
</p>
<p>the great number presented and the hurry and confusion of passing on them
</p>
<p>in the midst of the trial, with a large audience to keep in order, that there
</p>
<p>may be some apparent inconsistency in them, but if they are carefully
</p>
<p>scrutinized such inconsistencies will probably disappear. In any event,
</p>
<p>however, the gist and pith of all is that if advice and encouragement to
</p>
<p>murder was given, if murder was done in pursuance of and materially induced
</p>
<p>by such advice and encouragement, then those who gave such advice and
</p>
<p>encouragement are guilty of the murder. Unless the evidence, either direct
</p>
<p>or circumstantial, or both, proves the guilt of one or more of the defendants
</p>
<p>upon this principle so fully that there is no reasonable doubt of it, your duty
</p>
<p>to them requires you to acquit them. If it does so prove, then your duty
</p>
<p>to the State requires you to convict whoever is so proved guilty. The case
</p>
<p>of each defendant should be considered wfth the same care and scrutiny as
</p>
<p>if he alone were on trial. If a conspiracy, having violence and murder as

</p>
<p>its object, is fully proved, then the acts and declarations of each conspirator
</p>
<p>in furtherance of the conspiracy are the acts and declarations of each one
</p>
<p>of the conspirators. But the declarations of any conspirator before or after
</p>
<p>the 4th of May which are merely narrative as to what had been or would be
</p>
<p>done, and not made to aid in carrying into effect the object of the conspir-
</p>
<p>acy, are only evidence against the one who made them.
</p>
<p>" What are the facts and what is the truth the jury must determine from
</p>
<p>the evidence, and from that alone. If there are any unguarded expressions
</p>
<p>in any of the instructions which seem to assume the existence of any facts,
</p>
<p>or to be any intimation as to what is proved, all such expressions must be
</p>
<p>disregarded, and the evidence only looked to to determine the facts."
</p>
<p>The jury the next day reported to the court that they had agreed upon
</p>
<p>a verdict. The members were accordingly brought in, and the clerk of the
</p>
<p>court read the verdict as follows :
</p>
<p>"We, the jury, find the defendants August Spies, Michael Schwab,
</p>
<p>586
</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>Samuel Fielden, Albert R. Parsons, Adolph Fischer, George Engel and
</p>
<p>Louis Lingg guilty of murder in manner and form as charged in the indict-
</p>
<p>ment and fix the penalty at death. We find the defendant Oscar W. Neebe
</p>
<p>guilty of murder in manner and form as charged in the indictment, and fix
</p>
<p>the penalty at imprisonment in the penitentiary for fifteen years."
</p>
<p>This was a great surprise to the defendants, and their counsel at once
</p>
<p>entered a motion for a new trial. The hearing of the motion was postponed
</p>
<p>until the next term, and on the ist of October arguments were submitted.
</p>
<p>The grounds upon which the motion was based were numerous. They
</p>
<p>first related to a refusal of some, and a modification of several other in-
</p>
<p>structions at the hands of the court asked for by the defendants ; a claim
</p>
<p>that jurors had been summoned by the officers with the avowed view to
</p>
<p>conviction ; improper language by the State's Attorney in his closing argu-
</p>
<p>ment ; erroneous rulings of the court in regard to the competency of jurors,
</p>
<p>and the refusal of separate trials for the defendants. Other grounds touched
</p>
<p>on a statement made by one of the members of the jury, Mr. Adams, prior
</p>
<p>to the trial, with reference to the Haymarket massacre, showing prejudice
</p>
<p>against the defendants, backed by an affidavit as to what he said ; an
</p>
<p>affidavit of one Mr. Love, that he met Gilmer on the night of May 4, shortly
</p>
<p>after eight o'clock, and went to a saloon with him, where they and another
</p>
<p>person drank beer and talked until 9:20 o'clock, and also a further reason
</p>
<p>that the defendants had discovered some new evidence, to back which an
</p>
<p>affidavit was submitted from John Philip Deluse, dated August 24, 1886,
</p>
<p>concerning a mysterious individual who had called at his saloon, in Indian-
</p>
<p>apolis, Ind., in May, 1886.
</p>
<p>The argument of counsel on each side, on the points raised, consumed
</p>
<p>several days, and finally, on the yth of October, 1886, Judge Gary, in an
</p>
<p>elaborate and exhaustive opinion, overruled the motion.
</p>
<p>The defendants then entered a motion in arrest of judgment, and this

</p>
<p>AFTER motion in arrest of judgment had been overruled by Judge
</p>
<p>Gary, Spies was asked if he had anything to say why sentence of
</p>
<p>death should not be passed upon him. The prisoner rose, with pallid
</p>
<p>cheeks and distended eyes, and advanced toward the bench with a hesitat-
</p>
<p>ing tread. The moment he faced the court he recovered his equanimity
</p>
<p>and proceeded with much deliberation to give his reasons why he should not
</p>
<p>be sent to death on the gallows. He spoke in a firm, almost a menacing
</p>
<p>tone of voice, and seemed bent on posing as a martyr to the cause of the
</p>
<p>laboring classes. In his very opening sentence he desired to have that un-
</p>
<p>derstood. " In addressing this court," he said, "I speak as the represent-
</p>
<p>ative of one class to the representative of another. I will begin with the
</p>
<p>words uttered five hundred years ago, on a similar occasion, by the Venetian
</p>
<p>Doge Falieri, who, addressing the court, said, ' My defense is your accusa-
</p>
<p>tion. The cause of my alleged crime is your history.' " He then referred
</p>
<p>to his conviction, holding that there was no evidence to show that he had
</p>
<p>any knowledge of the man who threw the bomb, or that he had had any-
</p>
<p>thing to do with its throwing. There being no evidence to establish his
</p>
<p>legal responsibility, he maintained, his " conviction and the execution of the
</p>
<p>sentence would be nothing less than willful, malicious and deliberate murder,
</p>
<p>as foul a murder as may be found in the annals of religious, political or any
</p>
<p>sort of persecution." He charged that the representative of the State had
</p>
<p>" fabricated most of the testimony which was used as a pretense to con-

</p>
<p>vict," and that the defendants had been convicted " by a jury picked out
</p>
<p>to convict."
</p>
<p>"I charge," he continued, "the State's Attorney and Bonfield with the
</p>
<p>heinous conspiracy to commit murder." Having thus proved the truth of
</p>
<p>the old adage that "no rogue e'er felt the halter draw with good opinion of
</p>
<p>the law," Spies next paid his compliments to the Citizens' Association, the
</p>
<p>Bankers' Association and the Board of Trade, attributing to them the

</p>
<p>inspiration for the attack on the Haymarket meeting, and he proceeded to
</p>
<p>give an account of his movements on the night of that meeting in the com-
</p>
<p>pany of Legner. He again repeated that, " notwithstanding the purchased
</p>
<p>and perjured testimony of some," the prosecution had not established the
</p>
<p>defendants' legal responsibility, and insisted that those who had brought
</p>
<p>about their conviction were the "real and only law-breakers." When he ap-
</p>
<p>proached this part of the subject Spies' anger scarcely knew any bounds.
</p>
<p>He rose in a towering passion and characterized the proceedings of the trial
</p>
<p>as "rascalities perpetrated in the name of the people." He continued :
</p>
<p>"The contemplated murder of eight men, whose only crime is that they
</p>
<p>have dared to speak the truth, may open the eyes of these suffering millions ;
</p>
<p>may wake them up. Indeed, I have noticed that our conviction has worked
</p>
<p>miracles in this direction already. The class that clamors for our lives, the
</p>
<p>good, devout Christians, have attempted in every way, through their news-
</p>
<p>papers and otherwise, to conceal the true and only issue in this case. By
</p>
<p>simply designating the defendants as ' Anarchists,' and picturing them as a
</p>
<p>newly-discovered species of cannibals, and by inventing shocking and horrify-
</p>
<p>ing stories of dark conspiracies said to be planned by them, these good
</p>
<p>Christians zealously sought to keep the naked fact from the working people
</p>
<p>and other righteous parties, namely : That on the evening of May 4 two
</p>
<p>hundred armed men, under the command of a notorious ruffian, attacked a
</p>
<p>meeting of peaceable citizens ! With what intention ? With the intention
</p>
<p>of murdering them, or as many of them as they could. I refer to th^e testi-
</p>
<p>mony given by two of our witnesses. The wage-workers of this city b^gan
</p>
<p>to object to being fleeced too much they began to say some very true
</p>
<p>things, but they were highly disagreeable to our patrician class ; they put
</p>
<p>forth well, some very modest demands. They thought eight hours' hard
</p>
<p>toil a day, for scarcely two hours' pay, was enough. This lawless rabble
</p>
<p>had to be silenced ! The only way to silence them was to frighten them,
</p>
<p>and murder those whom they looked up to as their 'leaders.' Yes, these
</p>
<p>foreign dogs had to be taught a lesson, so that they might never again inter-
</p>
<p>fere with the high-handed exploitation of their benevolent and Christian
</p>
<p>masters. Bonfield, the man who would bring a blush of shame to the man-

<p>a visage that would have done excellent service to Dor6 in portraying
</p>
<p>Dante's fiends of hell Bonfield was the man best fitted to consummate the
</p>
<p>conspiracy of the Citizens' Association of our patricians. If I had thrown

<p>that bomb, or had caused it to be thrown, or had known of it, I would not

<p>orphans where now there are few. These facts have been carefully sup-
</p>
<p>pressed, and we were accused and convicted of conspiracy by the real
</p>
<p>conspirators and their agents. This, your honor, is one reason why sentence
</p>
<p>should not be passed by a court of justice if that name has any significance
</p>
<p>at all."
</p>
<p>Spies then adverted to the fact of his having published articles on the
</p>
<p>manufacture of dynamite and bombs, and wanted to know what other news-
</p>
<p>papers in the city had not done the same thing. He forgot to show, how-
</p>
<p>THE ARCH-CONSPIRATOR'S PROTEST. 589
</p>
<p>ever, that other papers had never urged the people to use dynamite to the
</p>
<p>destruction of the lives and property of the people.
</p>
<p>Spies claimed that his only offense was in espousing the cause of "the
</p>
<p>disinherited and disfranchised millions," and asked what they had said in
</p>
<p>their speeches and publications.
</p>
<p>"We have interpreted to the people their condition and relations in
</p>
<p>society. We have explained to them the different social phenomena and
</p>
<p>the social laws and circumstances under which they occur. We have, by
</p>
<p>way of scientific investigation, incontrovertibly proved and brought to their
</p>
<p>knowledge that the system of wages is the root of the present social iniqui-
</p>
<p>ties iniquities so monstrous that they cry to heaven. We have further
</p>
<p>said that the wage system, as a specific form of social development, would,
</p>
<p>by the necessity of logic, have to make room for higher forms of civilization ;
</p>
<p>that the wage system must prepare the way and furnish the foundation for
</p>
<p>a social system of cooperation that is, Socialism. That whether this or
</p>
<p>that theory, this or that scheme regarding future arrangements were
</p>
<p>accepted, was not a matter of choice, but one of historical necessity, and
</p>
<p>that to us the tendency of progress seemed to be Anarchism that is, a free
</p>
<p>society without kings or classes a society of sovereigns in which the
</p>
<p>liberty and economic equality of all would furnish an unshakable equilib-
</p>
<p>rium as a foundation and condition of natural order."
</p>
<p>After some further explanation of Socialism, he said :
</p>
<p>" I may have told that individual who appeared here as a witness that
</p>
<p>the workingmen should procure arms, as force would in all probability be
</p>
<p>the tiltima ratio, and that in Chicago there were so and so many armed
</p>
<p>men, but I certainly did not say that we proposed to inaugurate the social
</p>
<p>revolution. And let me say here : Revolutions are no more made than
</p>
<p>earthquakes and cyclones. Revolutions are the effect of certain causes and
</p>
<p>conditions. I have made social philosophy a specific study for more than
</p>
<p>ten years, and I could not have given vent to such nonsense ! I do believe,
</p>
<p>however, that the revolution is near at hand in fact, that it is upon us.
</p>
<p>But is the physician responsible for the death of the patient because he
</p>
<p>foretold that death ? "
</p>
<p>If the opinions of the court were good, Spies held there was "no person

<p>in this country who could not be lawfully hanged," and maintained that
</p>
<p>they ought to be exempted from responsibility because they had sought to
</p>
<p>bring about reforms. Then he turned to the labor movement and pro-
</p>
<p>nounced his anathema against the wealthy classes.
</p>
<p>" If you think that by hanging us you can stamp out the labor movement
</p>
<p>the movement from which the downtrodden millions, the millions who
</p>
<p>toil and live in want and misery the wage slaves expect salvation if
</p>
<p>this is your opinion, then hang us ! Here you will tread upon a spark, but
</p>
<p>there, and there, and behind you and in front of you, and everywhere, flames
</p>
<p>will blaze up. It is a subterranean fire. You cannot put it out. The
</p>
<p>ground is on fire upon which you stand. You can't understand it. You
</p>
<p>don't believe in magical arts, as your grandfathers did, who burned witches
</p>
<p>at the stake, but you do believe in conspiracies ; you believe that all these
</p>
<p>occurrences of late are the work of conspirators ! You resemble the child
</p>
<p>590 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>that is looking for his picture behind the mirror. What you see and what
</p>
<p>you try to grasp is nothing but the deceptive reflex of the stings of your
</p>
<p>bad conscience. You want to 'stamp out the conspirators' the agita-
</p>
<p>tors? Ah ! stamp out every factory lord who has grown wealthy upon the
</p>
<p>unpaid labor of his employes. Stamp out every landlord who has amassed
</p>
<p>fortunes from the rent of overburdened workingmen and farmers. Stamp
</p>
<p>out every machine that is revolutionizing industry and agriculture, that
</p>
<p>intensifies the production, ruins the producer, that increases the national
</p>
<p>wealth, while the creator of all these things stands amidst them, tantalized
</p>
<p>with hunger ! Stamp out the railroads, the telegraph, the telephone, steam
</p>
<p>and yourselves for everything breathes the revolutionary spirit. You,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, are the revolutionists. You rebel against the effects of social
</p>
<p>conditions which have tossed you, by the fair hand of fortune, into a mag-
</p>
<p>nificent paradise. Without inquiring, you imagine that no one else has a
</p>
<p>right in that place. You insist that you are the chosen ones, the sole pro-
</p>
<p>prietors. The forces that tossed you into the paradise, the industrial forces,
</p>
<p>are still at work. They are growing more active and intense from day to
</p>
<p>day. Their tendency is to elevate all mankind to the same level, to have
</p>
<p>all humanity share in the paradise you now monopolize. You, in your
</p>
<p>blindness, think you can stop the tidal wave of civilization and human
</p>
<p>emancipation by placing a few policemen, a few Gatling guns and some
</p>
<p>regiments of militia on the shore you" think you can frighten the rising
</p>
<p>waves back into the unfathomable depths whence they l^ave arisen, by

<p>respectable Board of Trade men only in this that they sought to recover
</p>
<p>property in an unlawful way, while the others sack the entire country law-
</p>
<p>fully and unlawfully this being their highly respectable profession. This
</p>
<p>court of 'justice and equity' proclaims the principle that when two persons
</p>
<p>do the same thing, it is not the same thing. I thank the court for this con-
</p>
<p>fession. It contains all that we have taught, and for which we are to be
</p>
<p>hanged, in a nutshell. Theft is a respectable profession when practiced
</p>
<p>by the privileged class. It is a felony when resorted to in self-preservation
</p>
<p>by the other class."
</p>
<p>He then scored the capitalistic class, and referred to the strikes in the
</p>
<p>Hocking Valley, East St. Louis, Milwaukee and Chicago. Reverting again
</p>
<p>to the prosecution, he continued :
</p>
<p>" 'These men,' Grinnell said repeatedly, 'have no principle; they are
</p>
<p>common murderers, assassins, robbers,' etc. I admit that our aspirations
</p>
<p>and objects are incomprehensible to some, but surely for this we are not to
</p>
<p>be blamed. The assertion, if I mistake not, was based on the ground that
</p>
<p>"NOT G UIL TY, B UT SCAPE GOATS." 591
</p>
<p>we sought to destroy property. Whether this perversion of facts was
</p>
<p>intentional, I know not. But in justification of our doctrines I will say that
</p>
<p>the assertion is an infamous falsehood. Articles have been read here from
</p>
<p>the Arbeiter-Zeitung and Alarm to show the dangerous character of the
</p>
<p>defendants. The files of the Arbeiter-Zeitung and Alarm have been searched
</p>
<p>for the past years. Those articles which generally commented upon some
</p>
<p>atrocity committed by the authorities upon striking workingmen were picked
</p>
<p>out and read to you. Other articles were not read to the court. Other
</p>
<p>articles were not what was wanted. The State's Attorney, upon those arti-
</p>
<p>cles (who well knows that he tells a falsehood when h& says it), asserts
</p>
<p>that 'these men have no principle.' '
</p>
<p>What a perversion of facts ! Some of the articles did comment on some
</p>
<p>alleged atrocity, but those taken at various dates and published in a pre-
</p>
<p>ceding chapter show that force by the use of dynamite was continually
</p>
<p>being agitated. However, in his criticism of the prosecution Spies seemed
</p>
<p>to overlook a great many points. He repeated what he had said to the Con-
</p>
<p>gregational ministers at the Grand Pacific Hotel, on the gth of January, 1886,
</p>
<p>with reference to Socialism, and then stated that he had seen Lingg only
</p>
<p>twice before he was arrested, but had never spoken to him. With
</p>
<p>Engel he had, not been on speaking terms for at least a year, and Fischer
</p>
<p>had gone about making speeches against him. The article in the Arbeiter-
</p>
<p>Zeitung with reference to the Board of Trade demonstration, he claimed, he
</p>
<p>had not seen until he had read it in the paper. In conclusion he said :
</p>
<p>"Now, if we cannot be directly implicated with this affair, connected
</p>
<p>with the throwing of the bomb, where is the law that says that ' these men
</p>
<p>shall be picked out to suffer' ? Show me that law if you have it ! If the
</p>
<p>position of the court is correct, then half of this city half of the popula-
</p>
<p>tion of this city ought to be hanged, because they are responsible the
</p>
<p>same as we are for that act on May 4th. And if not half of the population
</p>
<p>of Chicago is hanged, then show me the law that says, ' Eight men shall
</p>
<p>be picked out and hanged, as scapegoats ' ? You have no good law. Your
</p>
<p>decision, your verdict, our conviction is nothing but an arbitrary will of this
</p>
<p>lawless court. It is true there is no precedent in jurisprudence in this case !
</p>
<p>It is true that we have called upon the people to arm themselves. It is

<p>true that we have told them time and again that the great day of change
</p>
<p>was coming. It was not our desire to have bloodshed. We are not beasts.
</p>
<p>We would not be Socialists if we were beasts. It is because of our sensi-
</p>
<p>tiveness that we have gone into this movement for the emancipation of the
</p>
<p>oppressed and suffering. It is true that we have called upon the people to
</p>
<p>arm and prepare for the stormy times before us. This seems to be the
</p>
<p>ground upon which the verdict is to be sustained. ' But when a long train
</p>
<p>of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a
</p>
<p>design to reduce the people under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is
</p>
<p>their duty, to throw off such government and provide new guards for *heir
</p>
<p>future safety.' This is a quotation from the ' Declaration of Independence.'
</p>
<p>Have we broken any laws by showing to the people how the abuses that
</p>
<p>have occurred for the last twenty years are invariably pursuing one object,
</p>
<p>viz.: to establish an oligarchy in this country as strong and powerful and
</p>
<p>monstrous as never before has existed in any country ? I can well under-

<p>592 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>stand why that man Grinnell did not urge upon the grand jury to charge
</p>
<p>us with treason. I can well understand it. You cannot try and convict
</p>
<p>a man for treason who has upheld the Constitution against those who try to
</p>
<p>trample it under their feet. It would not have been as easy a job to do
</p>
<p>that, Mr. Grinnell, as to charge ' these men ' with murder.
</p>
<p>" Now these are my ideas. They constitute a part of myself. I cannot
</p>
<p>divest myself of them, nor would I if I could. And if you think that you
</p>
<p>can crush out these ideas that are gaining ground more and more every day,
</p>
<p>if you think you can crush them out by sending us to the gallows if you
</p>
<p>would once more have people suffer the penalty of death because they

<p>have dared to tell the truth and I defy you to show us where we have

<p>Truth crucified in Socrates, in Christ, in Giordano Bruno, in Huss, Galileo,

<p>still lives they and others whose number is legion have preceded us on

</p>
<p>MICHAEL SCHWAB had very little to say, but what he did say was that it
</p>
<p>was "idle and hypocritical to think about justice " having been done to them.
</p>
<p>He criticised the acts of the prosecution in securing his conviction " for
</p>
<p>writing newspaper articles and making speeches," and contended that they
</p>
<p>had engaged in no conspiracy, as "all they did was done in open daylight."
</p>
<p>He seemed rather vindictive toward Mr. Furthniann^ for having had the
</p>
<p>articles in the Arbeiter-Zeitung translated, and excused his own inflammatory
</p>
<p>utterances by holding that after the mayoralty election, in the spring of
</p>
<p>1885, Edwin Lee Brown, president of the Citizens' Association, had urged
</p>
<p>the people, in a public speech, " to take possession of the Court-house by
</p>
<p>force, even if they had to wade in blood." Schwab touched on the labor
</p>
<p>problem, drawing largely from his own experience while living among the
</p>
<p>poor in Europe, and then spoke of the condition of laborers in Chicago,
</p>
<p>holding that they lived in miserable, dilapidated hovels, owned by greedy
</p>
<p>landlords. He continued :
</p>
<p>" What these common laborers are to-day, the skilled laborer will be
</p>
<p>to-morrow. Improved machinery, that ought to be a blessing for the work-
</p>
<p>ingman, under the existing conditions turns for him to a curse. Machinery

</p>
<p>multiplies the army of unskilled laborers, makes the laborer more dependent
</p>
<p>upon the men who own the land and the machines. And that is the reason
</p>
<p>that Socialism and Communism got a foothold in this country. The outcry
</p>
<p>that Socialism, Communism and Anarchism are the creed of foreigners, is a
</p>
<p>big mistake. There are more Socialists of American birth in this country
</p>
<p>than foreigners, and that is much, if we consider that nearly half of all
</p>
<p>industrial workingmen are not native Americans. There are Socialistic
</p>
<p>papers in a great many States, edited by Americans for Americans. The
</p>
<p>capitalistic newspapers conceal that fact very carefully."
</p>
<p>In conclusion Schwab said :
</p>
<p>" If Anarchy were the thing the State's Attorney makes it out to be,
</p>
<p>how could it be that such eminent scholars as Prince Krapotkin and the
</p>
<p>greatest living geographer, Elisee Reclus, were avowed Anarchists, even
</p>
<p>NEEB&S EXPLANA TION. 593
</p>
<p>editors of Anarchistic newspapers ? Anarchy is a dream, but only in the
</p>
<p>present. It will be realized. Reason will grow in spite of all obstacles.
</p>
<p>Who is the man that has the cheek to tell us that human development has
</p>
<p>already reached its culminating point ? I know that our ideal will not be
</p>
<p>accomplished this or next year, but I know that it will be accomplished as
</p>
<p>near as possible, some day, in the future. It is entirely wrong to use the
</p>
<p>word Anarchy as synonymous with violence. Violence is one thing and
</p>
<p>Anarchy another. In the present state of society violence is used on all
</p>
<p>sides, and therefore we advocated the use of violence against violence,
</p>
<p>but against violence only, as a necessary means of defense. I never read
</p>
<p>Mr. Host's book, simply because I did not find time to read it. And if I
</p>
<p>had read it, what of it ? I am an agnostic, but I like to read the Bible
</p>
<p>nevertheless. 1 have not the slightest idea who threw the bomb on the
</p>
<p>Haymarket, and had no knowledge of any conspiracy to use violence on
</p>
<p>that or any other night."
</p>
<p>OSCAR NEEBE followed. In his opening sentence he very correctly
</p>
<p>diagnosed the situation when he said: " I have found out during the last
</p>
<p>few days what law is. Before I didn't know." He, more than all the
</p>
<p>other defendants, except Parsons, ought to have known the law. He was
</p>
<p>a citizen, and as such he should have known the law of the land long before
</p>
<p>he engaged in the inculcation of force. He spoke of his having presided
</p>
<p>at Socialistic meetings, having headed the Board of Trade procession, and
</p>
<p>how he happened to drive to the office of the Arbeiter-Zeitung after learning
</p>
<p>on May 5 that Spies and Schwab had been arrested.
</p>
<p>The rest of his statement consists simply of abuse of the prosecution,
</p>
<p>laudation of his own acts in endeavoring to ameliorate the condition of the
</p>
<p>workingmen and in continuing the publication of the Arbeiter-Zeitung after
</p>
<p>May 4, and a disavowal of his having distributed the "Revenge" circular.
</p>
<p>In speaking of his having organized the Beer-brewers' Union and attended
</p>
<p>a meeting at the North Side Turner Hall to announce the result of his
</p>
<p>conference with the bosses, he said :
</p>
<p>" I entered the hall. I went on the platform and I presented the union
</p>
<p>with a document signed by every beer-brewer of Chicago, guaranteeing ten
</p>
<p>hours' labor and $65 wages $15 more wages per month and no Sunday

</p>
<p>work, to give the men a chance to go to church, as many of vhem are good
</p>
<p>Christians. There are a good many Christians among them. So, in that
</p>
<p>way, I was aiding Christianity helping the men to go to church. After
</p>
<p>the meeting I left the hall, and stepped into the front saloon, and there were
</p>
<p>circulars lying there called the ' Revenge ' circular. I picked up a couple
</p>
<p>of them from a table and folded them together and put them in my pocket,
</p>
<p>not having a chance to read them, because everybody wanted to treat me.
</p>
<p>They all thought it was by my efforts that they got $15 a month more wages
</p>
<p>and ten hours a day. Why, I didn't have a chance to read the circulars.
</p>
<p>From there I went to another saloon across the street, and the president
</p>
<p>of the Beer-brewers' Union was there ; he asked me to walk with him, and
</p>
<p>on the way home we went into Heine's saloon. He was talking to Heine
</p>
<p>about the McCormick affair, and I picked up a circular and read it, and
</p>
<p>594 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>Heine asked me : ' Can you give me one ? ' I gave him one, and he laid
</p>
<p>it back on his counter. That is my statement."
</p>
<p>In conclusion Neebe said :
</p>
<p>" They found a revolver in my house, and a red flag there. I organized
</p>
<p>trades-unions. I was for reduction of the hours of labor, and the education
</p>
<p>of laboring men, and the reestablishment of the Arbeiter-Zeitung the
</p>
<p>workingmen's newspaper. There is no evidence to show that I was con-
</p>
<p>nected with the bomb-throwing, or that I was near it, or anything of that
</p>
<p>kind. So I am only sorry, your honor that is, if you can stop it or help
</p>
<p>it, I will ask you to do it that is to hang me, too ; for I think it is more
</p>
<p>honorable to die suddenly than to be killed by inches. I have a family and
</p>
<p>children ; and if they know their father is dead, they will bury him. They
</p>
<p>can go to the grave, and kneel down by the side of it ; but they can't go to
</p>
<p>the penitentiary and see their father, who was convicted for a crime that he
</p>
<p>hasn't had anything to do with. That is all I have got to say. Your honor,
</p>
<p>I am sorry I am not to be hung with the rest of the men. "
</p>
<p>ADOLPH FISCHER rose with some signs of nervousness and proceeded
</p>
<p>slowly and deliberately with his protest. "I was tried here in this room,"
</p>
<p>he said, " for murder, and I was convicted of Anarchy." He objected most
</p>
<p>vigorously to the charge that he was a murderer, and insisted that he had
</p>
<p>had nothing to do with the throwing of the bomb. He confessed to having
</p>
<p>made arrangements for the Haymarket meeting, to having been present,
</p>
<p>but urged that it had not been called for the purpose of committing violence
</p>
<p>or crime. He said he had been present at the Monday evening meeting,
</p>
<p>of which Waller was chairman, but aside from volunteering to have hand-
</p>
<p>bills printed for the Haymarket meeting he had not done anything. He
</p>
<p>had invited Spies to speak at the Haymarket, and in the original copy he
</p>
<p>had had the line put in, " Workingmen, appear armed ! " His reason for
</p>
<p>this was, he said, that he ''did not want the workingmen to be shot down in
</p>
<p>that meeting as on other occasions." He then entered into some details as
</p>
<p>to his movements on the night of the Haymarket gathering and again
</p>
<p>launched into a protest against the jury's verdict. He said that the verdict
</p>
<p>against him was because he was an Anarchist, and " an Anarchist," he ex-
</p>
<p>plained with a defiant toss of his head, " is always ready to die for his

<p>principles." He concluded as follows :
</p>
<p>"The more the believers in just causes are persecuted, the more quickly
</p>
<p>will their ideas be realized. For instance, in rendering such an unjust and
</p>
<p>barbarous verdict, the twelve ' honorable men ' in the jury-box have done
</p>
<p>more for the furtherance of Anarchism than the convicted have accomplished
</p>
<p>in a generation. This verdict is a death-blow to free speech, free press and
</p>
<p>free thought in this country, and the people will be conscious of it, too.
</p>
<p>This is all I care to say."

<p>Louis LINGG was in no gentle frame of mind when he advanced to enter
</p>
<p>his objection at the bar of the court. After a thrust at the court, he said

<p>that he had been accused of murder and been convicted; and "what

<p>proof," he defiantly asked, "have you brought that I am guilty?" He
</p>
<p>acknowledged that he had helped Seliger to make bombs ; " but," he stoutly
</p>
<p>maintained, " what you have not proven even with the assistance of your
</p>
<p>bought ' squealer,* ScUgcr, who would appear to have acted such a prom-
</p>
<p>inent part in the affair is that any of those bombs were taken to the Hay-
</p>
<p>market." He referred to the testimony of the experts as simply showing
</p>
<p>that the Haymarket bomb bore "a certain resemblance to those bombs
</p>
<p>of his," and that was the kind of evidence, he held, upon which he had
</p>
<p>been convicted. He had been convicted of murder, but it was Anarchy
</p>
<p>on which the verdict was based. "You have charged me with despising
</p>
<p>law and order/ " he said. " What does your * law and order ' amount to ?
</p>
<p>Its representatives are the police, and they have thieves in their ranks."
</p>
<p>He then opened fire on me because the detectives I had sent out had broken
</p>
<p>into his room, as he claimed, to effect his arrest, and insisted that he had
</p>
<p>not been at the Monday night meeting, but at Zepfs Hall, at that time,
</p>
<p>which I had stated to be false^
</p>
<p>Lingg next turned his attention to Mr. Grinnell, and accused him of
</p>
<p>having "leagued himself with a parcel of base, hireling knaves, to bring
</p>
<p>me to the gallows." Then the Judge came in for a scoring. " The Judge
</p>
<p>himself," he held. " was forced to admit that the State's Attorney had not
</p>
<p>been able to connect me with the bomb-throwing. The latter knows how
</p>
<p>to get around it, however. He charges me with being a ' conspirator. '
</p>
<p>How does he prove it ? Simph* b\~ declaring the International Working-
</p>

</p>
<p>he has the charge securely fastened on me. Excellent ! " He concluded as
</p>
<p>follows:
</p>
<p>" I tell you frankly and openly, I am for force. I have already told
</p>
<p>Captain Schaack. If they use cannon against us, we shall use dynamite

<p>against them.' I repeat that I am the enemy of the ' order ' of to-day, and
</p>
<p>I repeat that, with all my powers, so long as breath remains in me, I shall
</p>
<p>combat it. I declare again, frankly and openly, that I am in favor of using
</p>
<p>force. I have told Captain Schaack, and I stand by it, ' If you cannonade
</p>
<p>us, we shall dynamite you.' You laugh ! Perhaps you think, * You'll throw
</p>
<p>no more bombs,' but let me assure you that I die happy on the gallows, so

<p>GEORGE EXCEL appeared the least concerned of all when it came his
</p>
<p>turn to respond to the court's question as to any reasons he might have
</p>
<p>Pgpintit the infliction of the death penalty. He opened by setting forth his
</p>
<p>arrival in America in 1872 and gave some reasons which had prompted him
</p>
<p>to espouse Anarchy. It was "the poverty, the misery of the working
</p>
<p>classes." People here in a free land, he said, were " doomed to die of star-
</p>
<p>EN GEL'S LAST SPEECH. 597
</p>
<p>vation." He had read the works of Lassalle, Marx and George, and after
</p>
<p>studying the labor question carefully he had come, he said, to the conclu-
</p>
<p>sion that " a workingman could not decently exist in this rich country."
</p>
<p>He had sought to remedy the inequalities through the ballot-box, but after
</p>
<p>a time, he said, it had become clear to him " that the working classes could
</p>
<p>never bring about a form of society guaranteeing work, bread and a happy
</p>
<p>life by means of the ballot." He had labored for a time in the interest of
</p>
<p>the Social-Democratic party, but, finding political corruption in its ranks,
</p>
<p>he had left it.
</p>
<p>" I left this party and joined the International Working People's Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation, that was just being organized. The members of that body have
</p>
<p>the firm conviction that the workingman can free himself from the tyranny
</p>
<p>of capitalism only through force just as all advances of which history
</p>
<p>speaks have been brought about through force alone. We see from the
</p>
<p>history of this country that the first colonists won their liberty only through
</p>
<p>force ; that through force slavery was abolished, and just as the man who
</p>
<p>agitated against slavery in this country had to ascend the gallows, so also
</p>
<p>must we. He who speaks for the workingmen to-day must hang. And
</p>
<p>why ? Because this republic is not governed by people who have obtained
</p>
<p>their office honestly. Who are the leaders at Washington that are to guard
</p>
<p>the interests of this nation ? Have they been elected by the people, or by
</p>
<p>the aid of their money? They have no right to make laws for us, because
</p>
<p>they were not elected by the people. These are the reasons why I have
</p>
<p>lost all respect for American laws."
</p>
<p>Engel then alluded to the displacement of labor by machinery and held
</p>
<p>that the amelioration of the workingmen's condition could only be effected
</p>
<p>through Socialism. As to his conviction, he declared that he was not at all
</p>
<p>surprised. He had learned long ago that the workingman had no more
</p>
<p>rights here than anywhere else in the world. His crime, he insisted, con-
</p>
<p>sisted simply in having labored to "bring about a system of society by
</p>
<p>which it is impossible for one to hoard millions, through the improvements
</p>
<p>in machinery, while the great masses sink to degradation and misery." He
</p>
<p>believed that inventions should be free to all and touched on the aims of
</p>
<p>Anarchy. In his opinion "Anarchy and Socialism were as much alike as

</p>
<p>" It is true, I am acquainted with several of my fellow-defendants ; with
</p>
<p>most of them, however, but slightly, through seeing them at meetings, and
</p>
<p>hearing them speak. Nor do I deny that I, too, have spoken at meetings,
</p>
<p>saying that, if every workingman had a bomb in his pocket, capitalistic rule
</p>
<p>would soon come to an end.
</p>
<p>" That is my opinion, and my wish ; it became my conviction when I
</p>
<p>mentioned the wickedness of the capitalistic conditions of the day.
</p>
<p>' ' Can any one feel any respect for a government that accords rights only
</p>
<p>to the privileged classes, and none for the workers? We have seen but
</p>
<p>recently how the coal barons combined to form a co'nspiracy to raise the
</p>
<p>price of coal, while at the same time reducing the already low wages of their
</p>
<p>men. Are they accused of conspiracy on that account ? But when working-

</p>
<p>men dare ask an increase in their wages, the militia and the police are sent
</p>
<p>out to shoot them down.
</p>
<p>" For such a government as this I can feel no respect, and will combat
</p>
<p>them, despite their power, despite their police, despite their spies.
</p>
<p>" I hate and combat, not the individual capitalist, but the system that
</p>
<p>gives him those privileges. My greatest wish is that workingmen may
</p>
<p>recognize who are their friends and who are their enemies.

</p>
<p>SAMUEL FIELDEN entered into a long disquisition on the troubles of the
</p>
<p>working classes all over the world, and covered much of the ground traversed
</p>
<p>by him when on the witness-stand. He spoke of his having been in Eng-
</p>
<p>land a Sunday School superintendent, a local preacher of the Methodist
</p>
<p>Church, and an exhorter, and then chronicled his change of convictions after
</p>
<p>his arrival in the United States in 1868. He branched out into an exposi-
</p>
<p>tion of Socialism and cited instances of the oppression practiced on working
</p>
<p>people by capitalists. He then reviewed some of the points in the testi-
</p>
<p>mony against him and sought to show wherein his speeches at various
</p>
<p>meetings had been incorrectly reported in the newspapers. He had neither
</p>
<p>said at the Haymarket meeting, "Here come the bloodhounds," nor had he
</p>
<p>fired a revolver. He claimed that the meeting had been a peaceable one,
</p>
<p>and held that there had been no indication of trouble, and that his language
</p>
<p>had not been incendiary. He said :
</p>
<p>" I am charged with having said, ' Stab the law.' No one claims but that
</p>
<p>it was in connection with my conception of the meaning of Foran's speech,
</p>
<p>and the word 'stab' is not necessarily a threat of violence upon any person.
</p>
<p>Here at your primary elections you frequently hear the adherents of different
</p>
<p>candidates state before the primaries are called that they will 'knife ' so and
</p>
<p>so. Do they mean that they are going to kill him, stab him, take his life
</p>
<p>away from him ? They are forcible expressions very emphatic expres-
</p>
<p>sions. They are adjectives which are used in different ways to carry con-
</p>
<p>viction, and perhaps make the language more startling to the audience, in
</p>
<p>order that they may pay attention."
</p>
<p>In speaking of his arrest he said :

</p>
<p>" I didn't attempt to run away. I had been out walking around the
</p>
<p>street that morning, and there was plenty of opportunity for me to have
</p>
<p>been hundreds of miles away. When the officer came there I opened the
</p>
<p>door to him. He said he wanted me. I knew him by sight and I knew
</p>
<p>what was his occupation. I said : ' All right ; I will go with you.' I have
</p>
<p>said here that I thought, when the representatives of the State had inquired
</p>
<p>by means of their policemen as to my connection with it, that I should have
</p>
<p>been released. And I say now, in view of all the authorities that have been
</p>
<p>read on the law and regarding accessories, that there is nothing in the evi-
</p>
<p>dence that has been introduced to c'onnect me with that affair. One of the
</p>
<p>Chicago papers, at the conclusion of the State's Attorney's case, said that
</p>
<p>they might have proved more about these men, about where they were and
</p>
<p>what they were doing on the 2d and 3d of May. When I was told that
</p>
<p>FIELDEN'S FINAL APPEAL. 599
</p>
<p>Captain Schaack had got confessions out of certain persons connected
</p>
<p>with this affair, I said : ' Let them confess all they like. As long as they
</p>
<p>will tell only the truth, I care nothing for their confessions.' "
</p>
<p>Fielden next dwelt upon his treatment at the Central Station, and criti-
</p>
<p>cised the searching of houses without warrant. With reference to the trial
</p>
<p>he said :
</p>
<p>" We claim that the foulest criminal that could have been picked up in
</p>
<p>the slums of any city of Christendom, or outside of it, would never have
</p>
<p>been convicted on such testimony as has been brought in here, if he had not
</p>
<p>been a dangerous man in the opinion of the privileged classes. We claim
</p>
<p>that we are convicted, not because we have committed murder. We are
</p>
<p>convicted because we were very energetic in advocacy of the rights of labor.
</p>
<p>I call your attention to a very significant fact that on this day, at this time
</p>
<p>when the sentence of death is going to be passed on us, the Stock-yards
</p>
<p>employers have notified their employes that they will be required to work ten
</p>
<p>hours next Monday or they will shut down. I think it is a logical conclusion
</p>
<p>to draw that these men think they have got a dangerous element out of the
</p>
<p>way now, and they can return again to the ten-hour system. I know that I
</p>
<p>had considerable to do with the eight-hour question, although I only spoke
</p>
<p>once in that neighborhood, every man there being a stranger to me but I
</p>
<p>went down there in March previous and made an eight hour speech and
</p>
<p>formed the nucleus of an eight-hour organization there, and the Stock-yards
</p>
<p>succeeded in starting the eight-hour system, though they have not been able
</p>
<p>to keep it up in its entirety. We claim that we have done much. "
</p>
<p>He predicted that it would be a grand day when everybody adopted
</p>
<p>Socialism, and then touched on his own case, denying that he had entered
</p>
<p>into a conspiracy. Fischer, Lingg and Engel, he said, were men with
</p>
<p>whom he had not associated for a year, and therefore, he maintained, he
</p>
<p>could not have heen conspiring with them. He had never, he said, seen a
</p>
<p>dynamite bomb till he saw one in the court-room, and had never known that
</p>
<p>dynamite was kept at the Arbeiter-Zeitung office. In concluding his speech
</p>
<p>Fielden said :
</p>
<p>Your honor, I have worked at hard labor since I was eight years of
</p>
<p>age. I went into a cotton factory when I was eight years old, and I have

<p>worked continually since, and there has never been a time in my history
</p>
<p>that I could have been bought or paid into a single thing by any man or for
</p>
<p>any purpose which I did not believe to be true. To contradict the lie that
</p>
<p>was published in connection with the bill by the grand jury charging us
</p>
<p>with murder, I wish to say that I have never received one cent for agitat-
</p>
<p>ing. When I have gone out of the city I have had my expenses paid.
</p>
<p>But often when I have gone into communities, when I would have to
</p>
<p>depend upon those communities for paying my way, I have often come
</p>
<p>back to this city with money out of pocket, which I had earned by hard
</p>
<p>labor, and I had to pay for the privilege of my agitation out of the little
</p>
<p>money I might have in my possession. To-day as the beautiful autumn
</p>
<p>sun kisses with balmy breeze the cheek of every free man, I stand here
</p>
<p>never to bathe my head in its rays again. I have loved my fellow-men as

<p>I have loved myself. I have hated trickery, dishonesty and injustice.

<p>The nineteenth century commits the crime of killing its best friend. It will
</p>
<p>live to repent of it. But, as I have said before, if it will do any good, I
</p>
<p>freely give myself up. I trust the time will come when there will be a

<p>better understanding, more intelligence, and above the mountains of

<p>iniquity, wrong and corruption, I hope the sun of righteousness and truth
</p>
<p>and justice will come to bathe in its balmy light an emancipated world."
</p>
<p>ALBERT R. PARSONS consumed a great deal of time in the delivery of his
</p>
<p>speech. He began by declaring that the trial had been conducted with
</p>
<p>" passion, heat and anger," and pronounced the verdict as one of "passion,
</p>
<p>born in passion, nurtured in passion, and the sum totality of the organized
</p>
<p>passion of the city of Chicago." For that reason he asked for a suspension
</p>
<p>of sentence and a new trial. He said :
</p>
<p>" Now, I stand here as one of the people, a common man, a working-
</p>
<p>man, one of the^.masses, and I ask you to give ear to what I have to say.
</p>
<p>You stand as a bulwark ; you are as a brake between them and us. You
</p>
<p>are here as the representative of justice, holding the poised scales in your
</p>
<p>hands. You are expected to look neither to the right nor to the left, but to
</p>
<p>that by which justice, and justice alone, shall be subserved. The convic-
</p>
<p>tion of a man, your honor, does not necessarily prove that he is guilty.
</p>
<p>Your law-books are filled with instances where men have been carried to
</p>
<p>the scaffold and after their death it has been proven that their execution
</p>
<p>was a judicial murder. Now, what end can be subserved in hurrying this
</p>
<p>matter through in the manner in which it has been done ? Where are the
</p>
<p>ends of justice subserved, and where is truth found in hurrying seven
</p>
<p>human beings at the rate of express speed upon a fast train to the scaffold
</p>
<p>and an ignominious death ? Why, if your honor please, the very method of
</p>
<p>our extermination, the deep damnation of its taking-off, appeals to your
</p>
<p>honor's sense of justice, of rectitude, and of honor. A judge may also be
</p>
<p>an unjust man. Such things have been known."
</p>
<p>Parsons acknowledged being an Anarchist and proceeded to show the
</p>
<p>ends Anarchy sought. Then he asked :
</p>
<p>"Now, what is this labor question which these gentlemen treat with
</p>
<p>such profound contempt, which these distinguished 'honorable' gentle-
</p>
<p>men would throttle and put to ignominious death, and hurry us like rats to

<p>our holes ? What is it ? You will pardon me if I exhibit some feeling ? I
</p>
<p>have sat here for two months, and these men have poured their vitupera-
</p>
<p>tions out upon my head, and I have not been permitted to utter a single
</p>
<p>word in my own defense. For two months they have poured their poison
</p>
<p>upon me and my colleagues. For two months they have sat here and spat
</p>
<p>like adders the vile poison of their tongues, and if men could have been
</p>
<p>placed in a mental inquisition and tortured to death, these men would have
</p>
<p>succeeded here now vilified, misrepresented, held in loathsome contempt,
</p>
<p>without a chance to speak or contradict a word. Therefore, if I show
</p>
<p>emotion, it is because of this, and if my comrades and colleagues with me
</p>
<p>here have spoken in such strains as these, it is because of this. Pardon us.
</p>
<p>Look at it from the right standpoint. What is this labor question ? It is
</p>
<p>not a question of emotion ; the labor question is not a question of senti-
</p>
<p>ment ; it is not a religious matter ; it is not a political problem ; no, sir, it
</p>
<p>is a stern economic fact, a stubborn and immovable fact."
</p>
<p>PARSONS IN HIS O WN DEFENSE. 601
</p>
<p>He entered into along explanation of the capitalistic system and pointed
</p>
<p>to the troubles experienced by the laboring classes under the present con-
</p>
<p>ditions. He spoke of capitalistic combinations and "corners," touched on
</p>
<p>landlordism, discoursed on the eight-hour movement, and then reviewed
</p>
<p>some of the evidence against him. Referring to the Alarm, of which he
</p>
<p>had been editor, he said :
</p>
<p>" Why, the very article that you quote in the Alarm, a copy of which I
</p>
<p>have not, but which I would like to see, calling the American group to
</p>
<p>assemble for the purpose of considering military matters and military organ-
</p>
<p>ization, states specifically that the purpose and object is to take into consid-
</p>
<p>eration measures of defense against unlawful and unconstitutional attacks
</p>
<p>of the police. The identical article shows it. You forgot surely that fact
</p>
<p>when you made this observation ; and I defy any one to show, in a speech
</p>
<p>that is susceptible of proof, by proof, that I have ever said aught by word
</p>
<p>of mouth or by written article except self-defense. Does not the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution of the country, under whose flag myself and my forefathers were
</p>
<p>born for the last two hundred and sixty years, provide that protection, and
</p>
<p>give me, their descendant, that right? Does not the Constitution say that
</p>
<p>I, as an American, have a right to keep and to bear arms ? I stand upon
</p>
<p>that right. Let me see if this court will deprive me of it. Let me call
</p>
<p>your attention to another point here. These articles that appear in the
</p>
<p>Alarm, for some of them I am not responsible any more than is the editor
</p>
<p>of any other paper. And I did not write everything in the Alarm, and it
</p>
<p>might be possible that there were some things in that paper which I am not
</p>
<p>ready to indorse. I am frank to admit that such is the case. I suppose
</p>
<p>that you can scarcely find an editor of a paper in the world but that could
</p>
<p>conscientiously say the same thing. Now, am I to be dragged up here and
</p>
<p>executed for the utterances and writings of other men, even though they
</p>
<p>were published in the columns of a paper of which I was the editor ? Your
</p>
<p>honor, you must remember that the Alarm was a labor paper, published by
</p>
<p>the International Working People's Association, belonging to that body.
</p>
<p>I was elected its editor by the organization, and, as labor editors generally
</p>
<p>are, I was handsomely paid. I had saw-dust pudding as a general thing
</p>
<p>for dinner. My salary was eight dollars a week, and I have received that

</p>
<p>salary as editor of the Alarm for over two years and a half eight dollars a
</p>
<p>week ! I was paid by the association. It stands upon the books. Go down
</p>
<p>to the office and consult the business manager. Look over the record in
</p>
<p>the book, and it will show you that A. R. Parsons received eight dollars a
</p>
<p>week as editor of the Alarm for over two years and a half. This paper
</p>
<p>belonged to the organization. It was theirs. They sent in their articles
</p>
<p>Tom, Dick and Harry ; everybody wanted to have something to say, and I
</p>
<p>had no right to shut off anybody's complaint."
</p>
<p>He then offered some reasons to justify his utterances on labor questions.
</p>
<p>He quoted from newspapers to show their hostility to the interests of labor,
</p>
<p>and he dwelt on various strikes in the United States and endeavored to
</p>
<p>show how the men had been treated by corporations. The tramp question
</p>
<p>was next handled, and Parsons maintained that the present social system
</p>
<p>was responsible for the fact that millions did not know where to get a bed
</p>
<p>or supper. He continued :

</p>
<p>" Who are the mob ? Why, dissatisfied people, dissatisfied workingmen
</p>
<p>and women ; people who are working for starvation wages, people who are
</p>
<p>on a strike for better pay these are the mob. They are always the mob.
</p>
<p>That is what the riot drill is for. Suppose a case that occurs. The First

<p>trades-unions, and all of the organizations without arms. They have no
</p>
<p>treasury, and a Winchester rifle costs eighteen dollars. They cannot pur-
</p>
<p>chase those things. We cannot organize an army. It takes capital to or-
</p>
<p>ganize an army. It takes as much money to organize an army as to organize
</p>
<p>industry, or as to build railroads ; therefore, it is impossible for the working
</p>
<p>classes to organize and buy Winchester rifles. What can they do ? What
</p>
<p>must they do ? Your honor, the dynamite bomb, I am told, costs six cents.
</p>
<p>It can be made by anybody. The Winchester rifle costs eighteen dollars.
</p>
<p>That is the difference. Am I to be blamed for that ? Am I to be hanged
</p>
<p>for saying this? Am I to be destroyed for this? What have I done?
</p>
<p>Go dig up the ashes of the man who invented this thing. Find his ashes
</p>
<p>and scatter them to the winds, because he gave this power to the world. It
</p>
<p>was not I."
</p>
<p>Coming to the Haymarket meeting and referring to the presence of the
</p>
<p>police as an affront, he said :
</p>
<p>I
</p>
<p>" Was not that a most grievous outrage ? Was not that a violation of
</p>
<p>all of those principles for which our forefathers struggled in this country ?
</p>
<p>At this juncture some unknown and unproven person throws a bomb among
</p>
<p>the police, killing several men. You say that I did it, or you say that I
</p>
<p>knew of it. Where is your proof, gentlemen of the prosecution ? You have
</p>
<p>none. You didn't have any. Oh, but you have a theory, and that theory
</p>
<p>is that no one else could have had any motive to hurl that missile of death
</p>
<p>except myself, and, as is the common remark of the great papers of the city,
</p>
<p>the police are never short of a theory. There is always a theory on hand
</p>
<p>for everything. A theory they have got, and especially the detectives ; they
</p>
<p>hatch up a theory at once and begin to follow that out. There was a theory

<p>carried out during this trial. Let us examine that theory. I say that a
</p>
<p>Pinkerton man, or a member of the Chicago police force itself, had as much
</p>
<p>inducement to throw that bomb as I had, and why ? Because it would
</p>
<p>demonstrate the necessity for their existence and result 'in an increase of
</p>
<p>their pay and their wages. Are these people any too good to do such a
</p>
<p>thing ? Are they any better than I am ? Are their motives any better than
</p>
<p>my own ? Let us look at this thing now from every standpoint. Perhaps,
</p>
<p>on the other hand, the dread missile was hurled in revenge by some poor
</p>
<p>man or woman, or child even, whose parent or protector or friend was killed
</p>
<p>by the police in some of their numerous massacres of the people before.
</p>
<p>Who knows ? And if it was, are we seven to surfer death for that ? Are
</p>
<p>we responsible for that act ? Or, might it not be that some person with the
</p>
<p>fear of death in his eyes threw that bomb in self-defense ? And if they did,
</p>
<p>am I responsible for it ? Am I to be executed for that ? Is it law to put
</p>
<p>me to death for that? And who knows ? My own deliberate opinion con-
</p>
<p>cerning this Haymarket affair is that the death-dealing missile was the work,
</p>
<p>the deliberate work, of monopoly, the act of those who themselves charge us
</p>
<p>with the deed. I am not alone in this view of the matter."

</p>
<p>Monopoly, Parsons held, was responsible for the labor troubles
</p>
<p>"What are the real facts of that Haymarket tragedy? Mayor Harri-
</p>
<p>son, of Chicago, has caused to be published his opinion because, mark you,
</p>
<p>your honor, this is all a matter of conjecture. It is only presumed that I
</p>
<p>threw the bomb. They have only assumed that some one of these men
</p>
<p>threw that bomb. It is only an inference that any of us had anything to do
</p>
<p>with it. It is not a fact, and it is not proven. It is merely an opinion.
</p>
<p>Your honor admits that we did not perpetrate the deed, or know who did
</p>
<p>it, but that we, by our speeches, instigated some one else to do so. Now,
</p>
<p>let us see the other side of this case. Mayor Harrison, of Chicago, has
</p>
<p>caused to be published in the New York World and the interview was
</p>
<p>copied in the Tribune of this city, in which he says : ' I do not believe there
</p>
<p>was any intention on the part of Spies and those men to have bombs thrown
</p>
<p>at the Haymarket. If so, why was there but one thrown ? It was just as
</p>
<p>easy for them to throw a dozen or fifty^ and to throw them in all parts of
</p>
<p>the city, as it was to have thrown one. And again, if it was intended to
</p>
<p>throw bombs that night, the leaders would not have been there at all, in my
</p>
<p>opinion. Like commanders-in-chief, they would have been in a safe place.
</p>
<p>No, it cannot be shown that there was any intention on the part of these
</p>
<p>individuals to kill that particular man who was killed at that Haymarket
</p>
<p>meeting.' Now, your honor, this is the Mayor of Chicago. He is a sen-
</p>
<p>sible man. He is in a position to know what he is talking about. He has
</p>
<p>first-rate opportunities to form an intelligent opinion, and his opinion is
</p>
<p>worthy of respect. He knows more about this thing than the jury that sat
</p>
<p>in this room, for he knows I suspect that the Mayor knows of some of
</p>
<p>the methods by which most of this so-called evidence and testimony was
</p>
<p>manufactured. I don't charge it, but possibly he has had some intimation
</p>
<p>of it, and if he has, he knows more about this case and the merits of this case
</p>
<p>than did the jury who sat here. There is too much at stake to take any-
</p>
<p>thing for granted. Your honor can't afford to do that.
</p>
<p>" Is it nothing to destroy the lives of seven men ? Are the rights of the
</p>
<p>poor of no consequence? Is it nothing that we should regard it so lightly,
</p>
<p>as a mere pastime ? That is why I stand here at such length to present this
</p>
<p>case to you, that you may understand it ; that you may have our side of

<p>this question as well as that of the prosecution."
</p>
<p>Parsons then referred to attacks of the police on workingmen's meet-
</p>
<p>ings, and reviewed some of the evidence against himself, insisting that he
</p>
<p>had never seen Lingg until he saw him in the court-room.
</p>
<p>"Waller testified in chief, and reiterated it in cross-examination, that
</p>
<p>Engel and Fischer, these noble and brave Germans, offered a resolution at
</p>
<p>Greif's Hall, on the announcement that six men had been wantonly and
</p>
<p>brutally murdered by the police at McCormick's, that if other men should
</p>
<p>come into encounter with the police we should aid them ; and further swore
</p>
<p>that this plan was to be followed only when the police, by brutal force,
</p>
<p>should interfere with the workmen's right of free assemblage and free
</p>
<p>speech. Now, then, where is the foul and dastardly criminal conspiracy
</p>
<p>here ? Where is it ? So preposterous was it on its face to call such a
</p>
<p>noble compact to do a lawful thing a conspiracy, that it became necessary,
</p>
<p>in face of a dozen witnesses, both for the prosecution and the defense, who
</p>
<p>swear that the bomb came from the pavement on Desplaines Street, south
</p>
<p>604 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>of the alley, between the alley and Randolph Street a statement made by
</p>
<p>Bonfield himself to reporters about half an hour after the tragedy occurred,
</p>
<p>and published in the Times, on May 5, the following morning Louis Haas,
</p>
<p>Bonfield's special detective on the ground, at the Coroner's inquest, swore
</p>
<p>the bomb was thrown from the east side of Desplaines Street, and about
</p>
<p>fifteen feet, he believed, south of the alley, a statement confirmed by the
</p>
<p>witness Burnett, for the defense, who located it fifteen feet further south
</p>
<p>than Haas or Bonfield did still, on the impeached testimony of Gilmer,
</p>
<p>who swore the bomb was thrown from within the alley, we are convicted,
</p>
<p>because he was also willing to perjure himself by swearing that Spies lit
</p>
<p>the fuse of the fatal missile. The idea of a man striking a match in an
</p>
<p>alley to light a bomb in the midst of a crowd, the people and police stand-
</p>
<p>ing all around him ! It seems to me that such a statement as that ought,
</p>
<p>among sensible jnen, on the face of it, to carry its own refutation. Perfectly
</p>
<p>absurd ! If this statement bore the semblance of truth with regard to Gil-
</p>
<p>mer, or was the truth, not one of these defendants would shrink from the
</p>
<p>responsibility of the right of self-defense, your honor, and of free speech,
</p>
<p>and the right of the people peaceably to assemble. It is because this is
</p>
<p>not the work of the Anarchists or of the workingmen that we repel the
</p>
<p>charge, which proves there was no concerted action, and that it was none
</p>
<p>of the plans of these groups. It is not unlawful to repel an invasion of our
</p>
<p>meetings.
</p>
<p>" About this time some one, as testified to by three reputable witnesses,
</p>
<p>stopped at Indianapolis. That was in May. The Haymarket tragedy was
</p>
<p>the 4th. This man testifies to that fact. A stranger stops there. He says :
</p>
<p>' I am going to Chicago. I have something that will work. You will hear
</p>
<p>from it.' The man was in his cups, no doubt ; probably he drank too much.
</p>
<p>The Pinkertons are not all temperance men ; they sometimes take a little,
</p>
<p>and sometimes possibly take a little too much. Possibly he talked a little
</p>
<p>more than he ought to have talked. Possibly he didn't care, but at any rate
</p>
<p>it is sworn to that he said it. He came to Chicago, and the bomb was heard
</p>
<p>from and heard around the world. Your honor, is this an unreasonable
</p>
<p>assumption ? It is far more likely, much more reasonable than your honor's
</p>
<p>surmise that I instigated some one to do it.

</p>
<p>" The absolute proof that the missile thrown was not dynamite, but what
</p>
<p>was known in the late civil war as an infernal bomb, is in the evidence of
</p>
<p>every surgeon who testified that all incisions were clean, and that the flesh
</p>
<p>was torn as from an explosive in the interior. It was testified by these sci-
</p>
<p>entific men, your honor, that dynamite is percussive, and had a shell the
</p>
<p>size of Lingg's manufacture, on exhibition in evidence, been thrown in the
</p>
<p>closed ranks of the police, as was this infernal machine, instead of killing
</p>
<p>but one on the spot, and wounding a few others, it would have blown to
</p>
<p>unrecognizable fragments the platoons in the vicinity, and the wounds, where
</p>
<p>there were wounds, would have been as clean as with solid projectiles.
</p>
<p>" This was an infernal bomb from New York, brought there by the
</p>
<p>Indianapolis traveler, and not a dynamite bomb, the description in its effects
</p>
<p>upon its victims exactly corresponding with the description of those explo-
</p>
<p>sives when once used in battle on the Potomac. The hollow bullets within
</p>
<p>the shell, after entering the victim, exploded, lacerating the flesh and inflict-
</p>
<p>ing ugly internal and really infernal wounds.
</p>
<p>" Six of these condemned men were not even present at the Haymarket
</p>
<p>meeting when the tragedy occurred. One of them was five miles away, at
</p>
<p>PARSONS IN HIS O WN DEFENSE. 605
</p>
<p>the Deering Harvester Works, in Lake View, addressing a mass-meeting of
</p>
<p>two thousand workingmen. Another was at home, in bed, and knew not
</p>
<p>of the meeting being held at all until the next day. These facts, your honor,
</p>
<p>stand uncontradicted before this court. Only one witness Gilmer and
</p>
<p>his testimony is overwhelmingly impeached, as I remarked before con-
</p>
<p>nected the other two two only of these men with the tragedy at the Hay-
</p>
<p>market at all.
</p>
<p>" Now, with these facts, the attempt to make out a case of conspiracy
</p>
<p>against us is a contemptible farce. What are the facts testified to by the
</p>
<p>two so-called informers ? They said that two of these defendants were
</p>
<p>present at the so-called conspiracy meeting of Monday night. What, then,
</p>
<p>have you done with the other six men who were not members who were
</p>
<p>not present, and did not know of the meeting being held Monday night ?
</p>
<p>These two so-called informers testified that at the so-called conspiracy meet-
</p>
<p>ing of May 3 it was resolved that in the future, when police and militia
</p>
<p>should attack and club and kill workingmen at their meetings, then, and
</p>
<p>then only, they were in duty bound to help defend these working people
</p>
<p>against such unlawful, unrighteous and outrageous assaults. That was all
</p>
<p>that was said or done. Was that a conspiracy ? If it was, your honor, it
</p>
<p>was a conspiracy to do right and oppose what is wrong.
</p>
<p>" But your sentence says that it is criminal for the workingmen to re-
</p>
<p>solve to defend their lives and their liberties and their happiness against
</p>
<p>brutal, bloody and unlawful assaults of the police and militia."
</p>
<p>Parsons again returned to Anarchy and defined its doctrines at some
</p>
<p>length. In concluding his remarks, which consumed two hours on Friday
</p>
<p>and six hours on Saturday, he said :
</p>
<p>" The next day I saw that they were dragging these men to prison,
</p>
<p>treating them in a shameful manner. I left the city. I went to Geneva,
</p>
<p>111., for a couple of days ; staid there with friend Holmes. Then I went
</p>
<p>to Elgin, 111.; staid there a couple of days. Then I left there and went to
</p>
<p>Waukesha, Wis., where I obtained employment as a carpenter and after-
</p>
<p>wards as a painter, and remained for over seven weeks in Waukesha. My
</p>
<p>health was debilitated, and I went to the springs when I was thirsty. The
</p>
<p>house I was working on was only half a block from the springs, and I needed

</p>
<p>the recreation and the rest, and the pure air, and the water besides. When
</p>
<p>I saw the day fixed for the opening of this trial, knowing I was an innocent
</p>
<p>man, and also feeling that it was my duty to come forward and share what-
</p>
<p>ever fate had in store for my comrades, and also to stand, if need be, on the
</p>
<p>scaffold, and vindicate the rights of labor, the cause of liberty, and the
</p>
<p>relief of the oppressed, I returned. How did I return ? It is interesting,
</p>
<p>but it will take time to relate it, and I will not state it. I ran the gauntlet.
</p>
<p>I went from Waukesha to Milwaukee. I took the St. Paul train at the
</p>
<p>Milwaukee depot and came to Chicago ; arrived here at 8:30, I suppose, in
</p>
<p>the morning ; went to the house of my friend Mrs. Ames, on Morgan
</p>
<p>Street , sent for my wife and had a talk with her. I sent word to Captain
</p>
<p>Black that I was here and prepared to surrender. He sent word back to
</p>
<p>me that he was ready to receive me. I met him at the threshold of this
</p>
<p>building, and we came up here together. I stood in the presence of this
</p>
<p>court. I have nothing, not even now, to regret."
</p>
<p>The speeches of the defendants occupied three days the yth to the gth
</p>
<p>606 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>of October, inclusive and when Parsons had finished the court proceeded
</p>
<p>to pronounce sentence. Judge Gary said :
</p>
<p>" I am quite well aware that what you have said, although addressed to
</p>
<p>me, has been said to the world ; yet nothing has been said which weakens
</p>
<p>the force of the proof, or the conclusions therefrom upon which the verdict
</p>
<p>is based. You are all men of intelligence, and know that, if the verdict
</p>
<p>stands, it must be executed. The reasons why it shall stand I have already
</p>
<p>sufficiently stated in deciding the motion for a new trial.
</p>
<p>" I am sorry beyond any power of expression for your unhappy condi-
</p>
<p>tion, and for the terrible events that have brought it about. I shall address
</p>
<p>to you neither reproaches nor exhortation. What I shall say shall be said
</p>
<p>in the faint hope that a few words from a place where the people of the
</p>
<p>State of Illinois have delegated the authority to declare the penalty of a
</p>
<p>violation of jheir laws, and spoken upon an occasion so solemn and awful as
</p>
<p>this, may come to the knowledge of and be heeded by the ignorant, deluded
</p>
<p>and misguided men who have listened to your counsels and followed your
</p>
<p>advice. I say in the faint hope ; for if men are persuaded that because of
</p>
<p>business differences, whether about labor or anything else, they may destroy
</p>
<p>property and assault and beat other men and kill the police if they, in the
</p>
<p>discharge of their duty, interfere to preserve the peace, there is little
</p>
<p>ground to hope that they will listen to any warning.
</p>
<p>"It is not the least among the hardships of peaceable, frugal and
</p>
<p>laborious people to endure the tyranny of mobs who, with lawless force,
</p>
<p>dictate to them, under penalty of peril to limb and life, where, when and
</p>
<p>upon what terms they may earn a livelihood for themselves and their fami-
</p>
<p>lies. Any government that is worthy of the name will strenuously endeavor
</p>
<p>to secure to all within its jurisdiction freedom to follow their lawful avoca-
</p>
<p>tions in safety for their property and their persons, while obeying the law ;
</p>
<p>and the law is common sense. It holds each man responsible for the
</p>
<p>natural and probable consequences of his own acts. It holds that whoever
</p>
<p>advises murder is himself guilty of the murder that is committed pursuant
</p>
<p>to his advice, and if men band together for forcible resistance to the execu-
</p>
<p>tion of the law, and advise murder as a means of making such resistance
</p>
<p>effectual, whether such advice be to one man to murder another or to a

<p>numerous class to murder men of another class, all who are so banded
</p>
<p>together are guilty of any murder that is committed in pursuance of such
</p>
<p>advice.
</p>
<p>"The people of this country love their institutions. They love their
</p>
<p>homes. They love their property. They will never consent that by violence
</p>
<p>and murder their institutions shall be broken down, their homes despoiled
</p>
<p>and their property destroyed. And the people are strong enough to protect
</p>
<p>and sustain their institutions and to punish all offenders against their laws.
</p>
<p>And those who threaten danger to civil society if the law is enforced are
</p>
<p>leading to destruction whoever may attempt to execute such threats.
</p>
<p>" The existing order of society can be changed only by the will of the
</p>
<p>majority. Each man has the full right to entertain and advance, by speech
</p>
<p>and print, such opinions as suit himself ; and the great body of the people
</p>
<p>will usually care little what he says. But if he proposes murder as a means
</p>
<p>of enforcing them he puts his own life at stake. And no clamor about free
</p>
<p>speech or the evils to be cured or the wrongs to be redressed will shield him
</p>
<p>from the consequences of his crime. His liberty is not a license to destroy.

</p>
<p>The toleration that he enjoys he must extend to others, and he must not
</p>
<p>arrogantly assume that the great majority are wrong and that they may
</p>
<p>rightfully be coerced by terror or removed by dynamite.
</p>
<p>" It only remains that for the crime you have committed and of which
</p>
<p>you have been convicted after a trial unexampled in the patience with
</p>
<p>which an outraged people have extended
</p>
<p>you every protection and privilege of the
</p>
<p>law which you derided and defied the sen-
</p>
<p>tence of that law be now given.
</p>
<p>" In form and detail that sentence will

<p>substance and effect it is that the defendant

<p>Mr. Grinnell "If the court please, that is a matter that usually

<p>tribute to Mr. E. F. L. Gauss, who acted as inter-

<p>but in all the mass of testimony rendered into

<p>A LTHOUGH doomed to die, the prisoners did not despair. Their
</p>
<p>/~\ counsel led them to believe that the State Supreme Court would cer-
</p>
<p>tainly grant them a rehearing, and the first step to get their case before that
</p>
<p>court was to secure a stay of the execution of the sentence. For this pur-
</p>
<p>pose Hon. Leonard Swett was called into the case to assist Capt. Black,
</p>
<p>and the two gentlemen accordingly went before Chief Justice Scott, and on
</p>
<p>the 25th of November, 1886, secured the desired superseded*. In March,
</p>
<p>1887, the appeal came before the Supreme Court of Illinois, and arguments
</p>
<p>were heard in the case until the i8th of the same month, when the matter
</p>
<p>was taken under advisement. Several months elapsed before a decision
</p>
<p>was handed down, but meanwhile all the prisoners expressed the utmost
</p>
<p>confidence in a reversal of the judgment of the Criminal Court. Their
</p>
<p>counsel were alike confident of a rehearing, and sympathizers joined in the
</p>
<p>hopes indulged in by the men behind the bars and their representatives
</p>
<p>before the bar.
</p>
<p>On Wednesday, September 14, 1887, however, the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>rendered its decision, sustaining the findings of the lower court in every
</p>
<p>particular. It was given by the full bench, and there was not a dis-
</p>
<p>senting opinion. Justice Benjamin D. Magruder delivered the opinion.
</p>
<p>After stating various rulings bearing on murder, conspiracy, accessory be-
</p>
<p>fore the fact and other legal points involved in the case, and citing numer-
</p>
<p>ous extracts from the organs of the Anarchists and Herr Most's book, he
</p>
<p>reviewed the authorities given by the counsel to sustain their respective
</p>
<p>sides, and then delivered the opinion of the court, as follows :

<p>Cook County. The writ has been made a supersedeas.
</p>
<p>" Plaintiffs in error were tried in the summer of 1886 for the murder of
</p>
<p>Mathias J. Degan, on May 4, 1886, in the city of Chicago, Cook County,
</p>
<p>Illinois. On August 20, 1886, the jury returned a verdict finding the de-
</p>
<p>fendants August Spies, Michael Schwab, Samuel Fielden, Albert R. Par-
</p>
<p>sons, Adolph Fischer, George Engel and Louis Lingg guilty of murder,
</p>
<p>and fixing death as the penalty. By the same verdict they also found

<p>THE SUPREME COURTS DECISION.
</p>
<p>609
</p>
<p>Oscar W. Neebe guilty of murder and fixed the penalty at imprisonment in
</p>
<p>the penitentiary for fifteen years.
</p>
<p>"About the ist day of May, 1886, the workingmen of Chicago and of
</p>
<p>other industrial centers in the United States were greatly excited upon the
</p>
<p>subject of inducing their employers to reduce the time during which they
</p>
<p>should be required to labor on each day to eight hours. In the midst of
</p>
<p>the excitement growing out of this eight-hour movement, as it was called,
</p>
<p>a meeting was held on the evening of May 4, 1886, at the Haymarket, on
</p>
<p>Randolph Street, in the West Division of the city of Chicago. This meeting
</p>
<p>was addressed by the defendants Spies, Parsons and Fielden. While the
</p>
<p>latter was making the closing speech, and at some point of time between
</p>
<p>ten and half-past ten o'clock in the evening, several companies of police-
</p>
<p>men, numbering one hundred and eighty men, marched into the crowd
</p>
<p>from their station on Desplaines Street, and ordered the meeting to dis-
</p>
<p>perse. As soon as the order was
</p>
<p>given, some one threw among the
</p>
<p>policemen a dynamite bomb,
</p>
<p>which struck Degan, one of the
</p>
<p>police officers, and killed him.
</p>
<p>As a result of the throwing of the
</p>
<p>bomb and of the firing of pistol
</p>
<p>shots, which immediately succeed-
</p>
<p>ed the throwing of the bomb, six
</p>
<p>policemen besides Degan were
</p>
<p>killed, and sixty more were seri-
</p>
<p>ously wounded."
</p>
<p>The court then went into the
</p>
<p>law of accessory, confirming the
</p>
<p>interpretation and ruling of the
</p>
<p>trial court, that all distinction be-
</p>
<p>tween principals and accessories
</p>
<p>is by the Illinois statute abol-
</p>
<p>ished. The issue thus became :

</p>
<p>Were the defendants accessories
</p>
<p>to the murder of Degan?
</p>
<p>To find the answers to these
</p>
<p>questions the court went into an
</p>
<p>exhaustive review of all the evi-
</p>
<p>dence in the case, covering the
</p>
<p>same ground which has been gone over in the previous chapters of this
</p>
<p>book.
</p>
<p>First the bomb with which the murder had been done was considered.
</p>
<p>It had been proven to be round ; to have a projecting fuse ; to be of com-
</p>
<p>posite manufacture ; to contain tin and lead, with traces of antimony, iron
</p>
<p>and zinc ; to have upon it a small iron nut. All these characteristics were
</p>
<p>found in the bombs which Louis Lingg manufactured, and for these and
</p>

</p>
<p>610 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>other reasons the court held that the jury was warranted in believing that
</p>
<p>the bomb which killed Degan had been made by Lingg.
</p>
<p>The purposes of the conspiracy were next inquired into, and the articles
</p>
<p>in the Alarm, the platform of the Internationale and similar incendiary
</p>
<p>and dangerous language from many sources are quoted in full in the opinion.
</p>
<p>The organization of the Anarchists was also inquired into, and the divisions
</p>
<p>into groups, the make-up of the Lehr and Wehr Verein and like matters
</p>
<p>stated. The court declared this to be an "illegal conspiracy."
</p>
<p>The damning array of evidence against the assassins was brought to-
</p>
<p>gether relentlessly and completely. The speeches of the defendants were
</p>
<p>sifted, their teachings examined, and there could be left in no mind a doubt
</p>
<p>that these men had advised murder and arson, and that they were guilty
</p>
<p>technically as well as morally. The opinion of the court was a masterly
</p>
<p>presentation of the facts, and the conclusions drawn from them settled once
</p>
<p>for all both the law and the equity of this celebrated case. It was evident
</p>
<p>that there was law enough in America to protect society.
</p>
<p>That the Haymarket murders were the legitimate and' expected result
</p>
<p>of the teachings of the ring-leaders of the conspiracy was conclusively
</p>
<p>shown with a ruthless logic that left no hope for pardon, nor for interference
</p>
<p>with the law's stern course.
</p>
<p>Lingg's case, and the case of Spies, of Engel, of Fischer, of Parsons, of
</p>
<p>Neebe, of Fielden were taken up separately, examined with a care that
</p>
<p>might be described as almost microscopic, and in each case there was no
</p>
<p>flaw in the record no reason why these men should not pay the penalty
</p>
<p>for their crime.
</p>
<p>The concluding part of the opinion is so important from a legal stand-
</p>
<p>point, and at the same time of such general interest, that I will quote it
</p>
<p>entire :
</p>
<p>"If the defendants, as a means of bringing about the social revolution
</p>
<p>and as a part of the larger conspiracy to effect such revolution, also con-
</p>
<p>spired to excite classes of workingmen in Chicago into sedition, tumult
</p>
<p>and riot and to the use of deadly weapons and the taking of human
</p>
<p>life, and, for the purpose of producing such tumult, riot, use of weap-
</p>
<p>ons and taking of life, advised and encouraged such classes by newspaper

</p>
<p>articles and speeches to murder the authorities of the city, and a murder
</p>
<p>of a policeman resulted from such advice and encouragement, then defend-
</p>
<p>ants are responsible therefor.
</p>
<p>"It is a familiar doctrine of the law, in criminal cases, that, if a reason-
</p>
<p>able doubt of the guilt of the prisoner is entertained, the jury have no dis-
</p>
<p>cretion, but must acquit. The twelfth and thirteenth instructions for the
</p>
<p>prosecution are objected to as not correctly stating to the jury the meaning
</p>
<p>of ' reasonable doubt.' The twelfth instruction is an exact copy, verbatim
</p>
<p>et liberatim, of the sixth instruction in Miller et. al. vs. The People, 39 111.
</p>
<p>457, which we approved in that case, and which since that case we have
</p>
<p>indorsed as correct in at least three cases, to-wit : May vs. The People, 60
</p>
<p>THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION. 611
</p>
<p>111. 119, Connaghan vs. The People, 88 id. 460, and Dunn vs. The People, 109
</p>
<p>id. 635.
</p>
<p>" The portion of the thirteenth instruction which plaintiffs in error com-
</p>
<p>plain of is that which is contained in the following words : ' You are not at
</p>
<p>liberty to disbelieve as jurors if from the evidence you believe as men.'
</p>
<p>This expression has been sanctioned by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania
</p>
<p>as having been properly used in an instruction given to the jury by a trial
</p>
<p>judge, and we are inclined to follow the ruling there laid down. That
</p>
<p>court said in Nevling vs. Commonwealth, 98 Pa. St. 322 : ' The learned judge
</p>
<p>then proceeded to say that the doubt must be a reasonable one, and that
</p>
<p>jurymen could not doubt as jurymen what they believed as men. In
</p>
<p>all this there was no error. It is the familiar language found in the text-
</p>
<p>books and decisions which treat of the subject.'
</p>
<p>" By the twelfth and thirteenth instructions, considered in connection
</p>
<p>with the eleventh instruction for the State, and also in connection with the
</p>
<p>definitions of reasonable doubt as embodied in the instructions given for
</p>
<p>the defense, we think the law upon this subject was correctly presented to
</p>
<p>the jury.
</p>
<p>"The statute of this State provides that 'juries in all criminal cases
</p>
<p>shall be judges .of the law and fact.' Instruction number thirteen and a
</p>
<p>half, given for the prosecution, is objected to as improperly limiting and
</p>
<p>qualifying this provision of the statute. It tells the jury, that ' if they can
</p>
<p>say upon their oaths that they know the law better than the court itself,
</p>
<p>they have the right to do so,' . . . but that 'before saying this, upon
</p>
<p>their oaths, it is their duty to reflect whether from their study and experi-
</p>
<p>ence they are better qualified to judge of the law than the court,' etc.
</p>
<p>"The language of instruction number thirteen and a half is an exact
</p>
<p>copy, verbatim et literatim, of the language used by this court in Schnier vs.
</p>
<p>The People, 23 111. 17. The views expressed in Schnier vs. The People have
</p>
<p>been approved of and indorsed in Fisher vs. The People, 23 111. 283, Mullinix
</p>
<p>vs. The People, 76 id. 211, and Davison vs. The People, 90 id. 221. The ques-
</p>
<p>tion is settled, and we see no reason to retreat from our position upon this
</p>
<p>subject.
</p>
<p>" It is also claimed that the court erred in refusing to give certain in-

</p>
<p>structions asked by the defendants. The refusal of refused instructions
</p>
<p>numbered 3, 8, 9, n and 18 is especially insisted upon as error.
</p>
<p>" Instruction No. 3 was properly refused because it told the jury that
</p>
<p>those of the defendants who were not present at the Haymarket, counseling,
</p>
<p>aiding or abetting the throwing of the bomb, should be acquitted. Under
</p>
<p>our statute and the decision of this court in Brennan vs. The People, 15 111.
</p>
<p>517, the defendants were guilty if they advised and encouraged the murder
</p>
<p>to be committed, although they may not have been present.
</p>
<p>" Instruction No. 8 was wrong for a number of reasons, but it is sufficient
</p>
<p>to refer to one : it assumes that ' a conspiracy to bring about a change of
</p>
<p>government . . . by peaceful means if possible, but, if necessary, to
</p>
<p>resort to force for that purpose,' is not unlawful. The fact that the con-
</p>
<p>spirators may not have intended to resort to force, unless, in their judgment,
</p>
<p>they should deem it necessary to do so, would not make their conspiracy
</p>
<p>any the less unlawful.
</p>
<p>"All that was material in instructions 9, n and 18 was embodied in the
</p>
<p>instructions which were given for the defendants.
</p>
<p>" The defendants also complain that the court refused to give an instruc-
</p>
<p>612 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>tion for them which contained the following statement : ' It can not be
</p>
<p>material in this case that defendants, or some of them, are or may be Social-
</p>
<p>ists, Communists or Anarchists,' etc.
</p>
<p>" If there was a conspiracy, it was material to show its purposes and
</p>
<p>objects, with a view to determining whether and in what respects it was
</p>
<p>unlawful. Anarchy is the absence of government ; it is a state of society
</p>
<p>where there is no law or supreme power. If the conspiracy had for its
</p>
<p>object the destruction of the law and the government, and of the police and
</p>
<p>militia as representatives of law and government, it had for its object the
</p>
<p>bringing about of practical Anarchy. Whether or not the defendants were
</p>
<p>Anarchists, may have been a proper circumstance to be considered in con-
</p>
<p>nection with all the other circumstances in the case, with a view to showing
</p>
<p>what connection, if any, they had with the conspiracy and what were their
</p>
<p>purposes in joining it. Therefore, we can not say that it was error to refuse
</p>
<p>an instruction containing such a broad declaration as that announced in the
</p>
<p>above quotation.
</p>
<p>"Defendants further complain because the instruction numbered 13,
</p>
<p>which was asked by them, was refused by the trial court. The refusal of
</p>
<p>this instruction was not error. It was proper enough, so far as it stated
</p>
<p>that if a person at the Haymarket ' without the knowledge, aid, counsel,
</p>
<p>procurement, encouragement or abetting of the defendants or any of them,
</p>
<p>then or theretofore given, . . . threw a bomb among the police, where-
</p>
<p>from resulted the murder or homicide charged in the indictment, then the
</p>
<p>defendants would not be liable for the results of such bomb,' etc. But the
</p>
<p>instruction is so ingeniously worded as to lead the jury to believe that the
</p>
<p>person who threw the bomb at the Haymarket was justified in doing so if
</p>
<p>the meeting there was lawfully convened and peaceably conducted and if
</p>
<p>the order to disperse was unauthorized and illegal. Counsel inject into the
</p>
<p>instruction the hypothesis that the bomb may have been thrown by an out-
</p>
<p>side party ' in pursuance of his view of the right of self-defense.' A mere
</p>
<p>order to disperse can not be an excuse for throwing a dynamite bomb into
</p>
<p>a body of policemen. If the bomb-thrower had been illegally and improp-
</p>
<p>erly attacked by the police, while quietly attending a peaceable meeting,
</p>
<p>and had thrown the bomb to defend himself against such attack, another

</p>
<p>question would be presented. The vice of the instruction lies in the insid-
</p>
<p>ious intimation embodied in it, that when a body of policemen, even if in
</p>
<p>excess of their authority, give a verbal order to an assemblage to disperse,
</p>
<p>a member of that assemblage will be excusable for throwing a bomb, on the
</p>
<p>ground of self-defense and because of the supposed invasion of his rights.
</p>
<p>" The instruction given by the court of its own motion, and which has
</p>
<p>already been referred to, is also claimed to be erroneous. So far as it
</p>
<p>speaks of murder and advice to commit murder in general terms, it is suffi-
</p>
<p>ciently limited and qualified when read in connection with all the other
</p>
<p>instructions, to which it specifically calls attention. It does not supersede
</p>
<p>and stand as a substitute for the other instructions, given for both sides.
</p>
<p>It does not so purport upon its face. On the contrary, the jury are directed
</p>
<p>to ' carefully scrutinize ' such other instructions, and are told that their
</p>
<p>apparent inconsistencies will disappear under such scrutiny. In the last
</p>
<p>sentence they are requested to disregard any unguarded expressions that
</p>
<p>may have crept into the instructions, ' which seem to assume the existence
</p>
<p>of any facts,' and look only to the evidence, etc. Why caution the jury to
</p>
<p>disregard certain expressions of a particular kind in the other instructions,
</p>
<p>THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION. 613
</p>
<p>if the latter were to be entirely superseded ? We do not think that the
</p>
<p>instruction given by the trial judge sua motu is obnoxious to the objections
</p>
<p>urged against it.
</p>
<p>" Defendants also object to the instruction as to the form of the verdict
</p>
<p>as being erroneous. It is claimed that the jury were obliged, under this
</p>
<p>instruction, to find the defendants either guilty or not guilty of murder,
</p>
<p>whereas the jury were entitled to find that the offense was a lower grade of
</p>
<p>homicide than murder, if the evidence so warranted. This position is fully
</p>
<p>answered by our decisions in the cases of Dunn vs. The People, 109 111. 646,
</p>
<p>and Dacey vs. The People, 116 id. 555. If counsel desired to have the jury
</p>
<p>differently instructed as to the form of the verdict, they should have pre-
</p>
<p>pared an instruction, indicating such form as they deemed to be correct,
</p>
<p>and should have asked the trial court to give it. They did not do so, and
</p>
<p>are in no position to complain here.
</p>
<p>"The court, at the request of the defendants, did give the jury an instruc-
</p>
<p>tion defining manslaughter in the words of the statute and specifying the
</p>
<p>punishment therefor as fixed by the statute. The court also gave the jury
</p>
<p>the following instruction : ' The jury are instructed that under an indict-
</p>
<p>ment for murder a party accused may be found guilty of manslaughter ; and
</p>
<p>in this case, if from a full and careful consideration of all the evidence
</p>
<p>before you, you believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants or
</p>
<p>any of them are guilty of manslaughter, you may so find by your verdict.'
</p>
<p>" The next error assigned has reference to the impaneling of the jury.
</p>
<p>The counsel for plaintiffs in error have made an able and elaborate argu-
</p>
<p>ment for the purpose of showing that the jury which tried this case was
</p>
<p>not an impartial jury in the sense in which the word 'impartial* is used
</p>
<p>in our Constitution. We do not deem a consideration of all the points pre-
</p>
<p>sented as necessary to a determination of the case, and shall only notice
</p>
<p>those that seem to us to be material.
</p>
<p>" Nine hundred and eighty-one men were called into the jury-box and
</p>
<p>sworn to answer questions. Each one of the eight defendants was entitled
</p>
<p>to a peremptory challenge of twenty jurors, making the whole number of
</p>
<p>peremptory challenges allowed to the defense one hundred and sixty.
</p>
<p>The State was entitled to the same number. Seven hundred and fifty-seven

</p>
<p>were excused upon challenge for cause. One hundred and sixty were chal-
</p>
<p>lenged peremptorily by the defense and fifty-two by the State.
</p>
<p>" Of the twelve jurors who tried the case, eleven were accepted by the
</p>
<p>defendants. They challenged one of these, whose name was Denker, for
</p>
<p>cause, but, after the court overruled the challenge, they proceeded to fur-
</p>
<p>ther question him and finally accepted him, although one hundred and forty-
</p>
<p>two of their peremptory challenges were at that time unused. They ac-
</p>
<p>cepted the ten others, including the juror Adams, without objection. When
</p>
<p>Adams, the eleventh juror, was taken, they had forty-three peremptory chal-
</p>
<p>lenges which they had not yet used.
</p>
<p>" Therefore, as to eleven of the jurymen, the defendants are estopped
</p>
<p>from complaining. They virtually agreed to be tried by them, because they
</p>
<p>accepted them, when, by the exercise of their unused peremptory challenges,
</p>
<p>they could have compelled every one of them to stand aside.
</p>
<p>" Counsel for the defense complain that the trial court overruled their
</p>
<p>challenges for cause of twenty-six talesmen, to whose examinations they
</p>
<p>specifically call our attention. As they afterwards peremptorily challenged
</p>
<p>the talesmen so referred to, no one of them sat upon the jury. Every one
</p>
<p>614 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>of these twenty-six men had been peremptorily challenged before the elev-
</p>
<p>enth juror was taken.
</p>
<p>" After the eleventh juror was accepted, the forty-three peremptory chal-
</p>
<p>lenges which then remained to the defendants were all used by them before
</p>
<p>the twelfth juror was taken.
</p>
<p>" After the defendants had examined the twelfth juror, whose name was
</p>
<p>Sandford, they challenged him for cause. Their challenge was overruled
</p>
<p>and they excepted.
</p>
<p>" The one hundred and sixty talesmen who were peremptorily challenged
</p>
<p>by defendants were first challenged for cause, and the challenges for cause
</p>
<p>were overruled by the trial court. It is claimed that, inasmuch as the de-
</p>
<p>fendants exhausted all their peremptory challenges before the panel was
</p>
<p>finally completed, the action of the court in regard to these particular jurors
</p>
<p>will be considered, and, if erroneous, such action is good ground of reversal.
</p>
<p>We think it must be made to appear that an objectionable juror was put
</p>
<p>upon the defendants after they had exhausted their peremptory challenges.
</p>
<p>' Unless objection is shown to one or more of the jury who tried the case,
</p>
<p>the antecedent rulings of the court upon the competency or incompetency
</p>
<p>of jurors who have been challenged and stood aside will not be inquired
</p>
<p>into in this court." Holt vs. State, 9 Texas Ct. App. 571.
</p>
<p>" We cannot reverse this judgment for errors committed in the lower
</p>
<p>court in overruling challenges for cause to jurors, even though defendants
</p>
<p>exhausted their peremptory challenges, unless it is further shown that an
</p>
<p>objectionable juror was forced upon them and sat upon the case after they
</p>
<p>had exhausted their peremptory challenges. This doctrine is ably discussed
</p>
<p>in Loggins vs. State, 12 Texas Ct. App. 65. We think the reasoning in that
</p>
<p>case is sound and answers the objection here made.
</p>
<p>" In addition to this reason, we have carefully considered the examina-
</p>
<p>tions of the several jurors challenged by the defendants peremptorily, and
</p>
<p>while we cannot approve all that was said by the trial judge in respect to
</p>
<p>some of them, we find no such error in the rulings of the court in overruling
</p>
<p>the challenges for cause as to any of them as would justify a reversal of the
</p>
<p>cause. The examinations, as they appear in the record, of the forty-three
</p>
<p>talesmen who were challenged peremptorily after the eleventh juror was

</p>
<p>accepted, show that many of the forty-three challenges were exercised arbi-
</p>
<p>trarily and without any apparent cause. Such challenges were not com-
</p>
<p>pelled by any demonstrated unfitness of the jurors, but seem to have been
</p>
<p>used up for no other purpose than to force the selection of one juror after
</p>
<p>the forty-three challenges were exhausted.
</p>
<p>" The only question, then, which we deem it material to consider, is :
</p>
<p>Did the trial court err in overruling the challenge for cause of Sandford, the
</p>
<p>twelfth juror? or, in other words, Was he a competent juror?
</p>
<p>" The following is the material portion of his examination :
</p>
<p>" Have you an opinion as to whether or not there was an offense committed at the Hay-
</p>
<p>market meeting by the throwing of a bomb ? A. Yes. Q. Now, from all that you have
</p>
<p>read and all that you have heard, have you an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of any of
</p>
<p>the eight defendants of the throwing of that bomb ? A. Yes. Q. You have an opinion
</p>
<p>upon that question also ? A. I have. . . . Q. Now, if you should be selected as a juror in
</p>
<p>this case to try and determine it, do you believe that you could exercise legally the duties of
</p>
<p>a juror, that you could listen to the testimony and all of the testimony and the charge of the
</p>
<p>court, and after deliberation return a verdict which would be right and fair as between the
</p>
<p>defendants and the People of the State of Illinois ? A. Yes, sir. Q. You believe that
</p>
<p>you could do that ? A. Yes, sir. Q. You could fairly and impartially listen to the testi-
</p>
<p>THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION. 615
</p>
<p>mony that is introduced here ? A. Yes. Q. And the charge of the court, and render an
</p>
<p>impartial verdict, you believe ? A. Yes. Cj. Have you any knowledge of the principles
</p>
<p>contended for by Socialists, Communists and Anarchists ? A. Nothing except what I read
</p>
<p>in the papers. Q. Just general reading ? A. Yes. Q. You are not a Socialist, I pre-
</p>
<p>sume, or a Communist ? A. No, sir. Q. Have you a prejudice against them from
</p>
<p>what you have read in the papers ? A. Decided. Q. Do you believe that that would in-
</p>
<p>fluence your verdict in this case or would you try the real issue which is here as to whether
</p>
<p>the defendants were guilty of the murder of Mr. Degan or not, or would you try the ques-
</p>
<p>tion of Socialism and Anarchism, which really has nothing to do with the case ? A. Well,
</p>
<p>as I know so little about it in reality at present, it is a pretty hard question to answer. Q. You
</p>
<p>would undertake, you would attempt of course to try the case upon the evidence introduced
</p>
<p>here, upon the issue which is presented here ? A. Yes, sir. . Q. Well, then, so
</p>
<p>far as that is concerned, I do not care very much what your opinion may be now, for your
</p>
<p>opinion now is made up of random conversations and from newspaper reading, as I understand?
</p>
<p>A. Yes. Q. That is nothing reliable. You do not regard that as being in the nature of
</p>
<p>sworn testimony at all, do you ? A. No. Q. Now, when the testimony is introduced here and
</p>
<p>the witnesses are examined, you see them and look into their countenances, judge who are
</p>
<p>worthy of belief and who are not worthy of belief, don't you think then you would be able to
</p>
<p>determine the question ? A. Yes. Q. Regardless of any impression that you might
</p>
<p>have or any opinion ? A. Yes. Q. Have you any opposition to the organization by
</p>
<p>laboring men of associations or societies or unions so far as they have reference to their own
</p>
<p>advancement and protection and are not in violation of law ? A. No, sir. Q. Do you
</p>
<p>know any of the members of the police force of the city of Chicago ? A. Not one by name.
</p>
<p>Q. You are not acquainted with any one that was either injured or killed, I suppose, at the
</p>
<p>Haymarket meeting ? A. No. . . . Q. If you should be selected as a juror in this case,
</p>
<p>do you believe that, regardless of all prejudice or opinion which you now have, you could
</p>
<p>listen to the legitimate testimony introduced in court, and upon that, and that alone, render
</p>
<p>and return a fair and impartial, unprejudiced and unbiased verdict ? A. Yes.
</p>
<p>The foregoing examination was by the defense. The following was by
</p>
<p>the State :
</p>
<p>" Cj. Upon what is your opinion founded upon newspaper reports? A. Well, it is
</p>
<p>founded on the general theory and what I read in the newspapers. Q. And what you read
</p>
<p>in the papers ? A. Yes, sir Q. Have you ever talked with any one that was present at
</p>
<p>the Haymarket at the time the bomb was thrown ? A. No, sir. Have you ever talked with

</p>
<p>any one who professed of his own knowledge to know anything about the connection of the
</p>
<p>defendants with the throwing of that bomb ? A. No. Q. Have you ever said to any one
</p>
<p>whether or not you believed the statement of facts in the newspapers to be true ? A. I
</p>
<p>have never expressed it exactly in that way, but still I have no reason to think they were
</p>
<p>false. Q. Well, the question is not what your opinion of that was. The question simply
</p>
<p>is it is a question made necessary by our statute, perhaps. A. Well, I don't recall
</p>
<p>whether I have or not. Q. So far as you know then, you never have ? A. No, sir. Q.
</p>
<p>Do you believe that, if taken as a juror, you can try this case fairly and impartially and ren-
</p>
<p>der an impartial verdict upon the law and the evidence ? A. Yes.
</p>
<p>" It is objected that Sandford had formed such an opinion as disquali-
</p>
<p>fied him from sitting upon the jury.
</p>
<p>" It is apparent from the foregoing examination that the opinion of the
</p>
<p>juror was based upon rumor or newspaper statements, and that he had ex-
</p>
<p>pressed no opinion as to the truth of such rumors or statements. He
</p>
<p>stated upon oath that he believed he could fairly and impartially render a
</p>
<p>verdict in the case in accordance with the law and the evidence. That
</p>
<p>the trial court was satisfied of the truth of his statement would appear from
</p>
<p>the fact that the challenge for cause was overruled.
</p>
<p>" Therefore, the examination of the juror shows a state of facts which
</p>
<p>brings his case exactly within the scope and meaning of the third proviso
</p>
<p>of the i4th section of chapter 78, entitled 'Jurors,' of our Revised Stat-
</p>
<p>utes. That proviso is as follows : ' And provided further, that, in the trial
</p>
<p>of any criminal cause, the fact that a person called as a juror has formed an
</p>
<p>opinion or impression, based upon rumor or upon newspaper statements
</p>
<p>616 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>(about the truth of which he has expressed no opinion), shall not disqualify
</p>
<p>him to serve as a juror in such case, if he shall, upon oath, state that he
</p>
<p>believes he can fairly and impartially render a verdict therein in accordance
</p>
<p>with the law and the evidence, and the court shall be satisfied of the truth
</p>
<p>of such statement.'
</p>
<p>"In Wilson vs. The People, 94 111. 299, one William Gray was examined
</p>
<p>touching his qualifications as a juror and said : ' I have read newspaper
</p>
<p>accounts of the commission of the crime with which the defendant is
</p>
<p>charged and have also conversed with several persons in regard to it since
</p>
<p>coming to Carthage and during my attendance upon this term of court ; do
</p>
<p>not know whether they are witnesses in the case or not ; do not know who
</p>
<p>the witnesses in the case are. From accounts I have read and from con-
</p>
<p>versations I have had, I have formed an opinion in the case ; would have an
</p>
<p>opinion now if the facts should turn out as I heard them, and I think it
</p>
<p>would take some evidence to remove that opinion ; would be governed by
</p>
<p>the evidence in the case and can give the defendant a fair and impartial
</p>
<p>trial according to the law and the evidence.' Gray was challenged for
</p>
<p>cause and the challenge overruled by the trial court. We held that all ob-
</p>
<p>jection to Gray's competency was clearly removed by the proviso above
</p>
<p>quoted. We also there said : ' The opinion formed seems not to have
</p>
<p>been decided, but one of a light and transient character which at no time
</p>
<p>would have disqualified the juror from serving.'
</p>
<p>"The expressions of Sandford in the case at bar as to the opinion
</p>
<p>formed by him are not so strong as those used by Gray in the Wilson case in
</p>
<p>regard to his opinion. Sandford's impressions were not such as would
</p>
<p>refuse to yield to the testimony that might be offered, nor were they such
</p>
<p>as to close his mind to a fair consideration of the testimony. They were
</p>
<p>not 'strong and deep impressions,' such as are referred to by Chief Justice
</p>
<p>Marshall when he said upon the trial of Aaron Burr for treason : ' Those
</p>
<p>strong and deep impressions which will close the mind against the testi-
</p>
<p>mony which may be offered in opposition to them, which will combat that
</p>
<p>testimony and resist its force, do constitute a sufficient objection' to a juror,
</p>
<p>(i Burr's Trial, 416.)
</p>
<p>" Counsel for the defense seem to claim in their argument that the pro-

</p>
<p>viso above quoted is unconstitutional in that it violates section 9 of article
</p>
<p>2 of the present Constitution of this State, which guarantees to the accused
</p>
<p>party in every criminal prosecution ' a speedy public trial by an impartial
</p>
<p>jury of the county or district in which the offense is alleged to have been
</p>
<p>committed.' We do not think that the proviso is unconstitutional for the
</p>
<p>reason stated. The rule which it lays down, when wisely applied, does not
</p>
<p>lead to the selection of partial jurors. On the contrary, it tends to secure
</p>
<p>intelligence in the jury-box and to exclude from it that dense ignorance
</p>
<p>which has often subjected the jury system to just criticism. A statute upon
</p>
<p>this subject, similar to ours and attacked as unconstitutional for the same
</p>
<p>reason here indicated, was held to be constitutional by the Court of Appeals
</p>
<p>in the State of New York in Stokes vs. The People, 53 N. Y. 171.
</p>
<p>"The juror Sandford further stated that he had a prejudice against
</p>
<p>Socialists, Communists and Anarchists. This did not disqualify him from
</p>
<p>sitting as a juror. If the theories of the Anarchists should be carried into
</p>
<p>practical effect, they would involve the destruction of all law and govern-
</p>
<p>ment. Law and government cannot be abolished without revolution, blood-
</p>
<p>shed and murder. The Socialist or Communist, if he attempted to put into
</p>
<p>THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION. 617
</p>
<p>practical operation his doctrine of a community of property, would destroy
</p>
<p>individual rights in property. Practically considered, the idea of taking a
</p>
<p>man's property from him without his consent, for the purpose of putting it
</p>
<p>into a common fund for the benefit of the community at large, involves the
</p>
<p>commission of theft and robbery. Therefore, the prejudice which the ordi-
</p>
<p>nary citizen, who looks at things from a practical standpoint, would have
</p>
<p>against Anarchism and Communism, would be nothing more than a preju-
</p>
<p>dice against crime.
</p>
<p>" In Winnesheik Insurance Co. vs. Schucller, 60 111. 465, we said : ' A man
</p>
<p>may have a prejudice against crime, against a mean action, against dishon-
</p>
<p>esty, and still be a competent juror. This is proper, and such prejudice
</p>
<p>will never force a jury to prejudge an innocent and honest man.' In Rob-
</p>
<p>inson et al. vs. Randall, supra, we again said : ' The mere fact, therefore,
</p>
<p>that a juror may have a prejudice against crime does not disqualify him as
</p>
<p>a juror. A juror may be prejudiced against larceny, or burglary, or mur-
</p>
<p>der, and yet such fact would not in the least disqualify him from sitting
</p>
<p>upon a jury to try some person who might be charged with one of these
</p>
<p>crimes.'
</p>
<p>" Sandford stated that he would ' attempt to try the case upon the evi-
</p>
<p>dence introduced here upon the issue which is presented here.' The issue
</p>
<p>presented was whether the defendants were guilty or not guilty of the mur-
</p>
<p>der of Mathias J. Degan. Any prejudice against Communism or Anar-
</p>
<p>chism would not render a juror incapable of trying that issue fairly and
</p>
<p>impartially.
</p>
<p>" We cannot see that the trial court erred in overruling the challenge
</p>
<p>for cause of the twelfth juror. This being so, it does not appear that the
</p>
<p>defendants were injured, or that their rights were in any way prejudiced by
</p>
<p>his selection as a juryman.
</p>
<p>"On the motion for a new trial the defendants read three affidavits for
</p>
<p>the purpose of showing that, shortly after May 4, 1886, two of the jurors
</p>
<p>had given utterance to expressions showing prejudice against the defend-
</p>
<p>ants. The two jurors made counter-affidavits denying that they had used
</p>
<p>the expressions attributed to them.
</p>
<p>"We do not think that the affidavits satisfactorily proved previously

</p>
<p>expressed opinions on the part of the two jurors referred to. It was a dan-
</p>
<p>gerous practice to allow verdicts to be set aside upon ex parte affidavits as
</p>
<p>to what jurors are claimed to have said before they were summoned to act
</p>
<p>as jurymen. The parties making such affidavits submit to no cross-exam-
</p>
<p>ination, and the correctness of their statements is subjected to no test what-
</p>
<p>ever. We adhere to the views which we have recently expressed upon this
</p>
<p>subject in the case of Hughes vs. The People, 116 111. 330.
</p>
<p>"The defendants claim that, although they were entitled to one hundred
</p>
<p>and sixty peremptory challenges, yet the State was entitled to only twenty,
</p>
<p>and they charge it as error that the State was allowed to peremptorily chal-
</p>
<p>lenge more than twenty talesmen. The statute says : ' The attorney
</p>
<p>prosecuting on behalf of the people shall be admitted to a peremptory
</p>
<p>challenge of the same number of jurors that the accused is entitled to.'
</p>
<p>(Rev. Stat. chap. 38, sec. 432.) We cannot conceive how language can be
</p>
<p>plainer than that here used. It explains itself and requires no further
</p>
<p>remark. The defendants also claim that the trial court erred in refusing
</p>
<p>a separate trial, from the other defendants, to the defendants Spies, Schwab,
</p>
<p>Fielden, Neebe and Parsons. Error cannot be assigned upon the refusal to
</p>
<p>6i8 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>grant separate trials where several are jointly indicted. It was a matter of
</p>
<p>discretion with the court below. We so decided in Maton et al. vs. The
</p>
<p>People, 15 111. 536. We are unable to see any abuse of the discretion in
</p>
<p>this case.
</p>
<p>" Defendants also take exceptions to the conduct of the special bailiff
</p>
<p>The regular panel having been exhausted and the defendants having ob-
</p>
<p>jected ' to the Sheriff summoning a sufficient number of persons to fill the
</p>
<p>panel' of jurors, the court appointed a special bailiff named Ryce to sum-
</p>
<p>mon such persons under section 13, chapter 78, of the Revised Statutes.
</p>
<p>On the motion for new trial, defendants read the affidavit of one Stevens, in
</p>
<p>which Stevens swore that he had heard one Favor say that he, Favor, had
</p>
<p>heard Ryce say that he, Ryce, was summoning as jurors such men as the
</p>
<p>defense would be compelled to challenge peremptorily, etc. The defend-
</p>
<p>ants then made a motion, based upon this affidavit, that Favor be com-
</p>
<p>pelled to come into court and testify to what Ryce had said to him. The
</p>
<p>refusal of the court to grant the application is complained of as error.
</p>
<p>" The statements in the affidavit were mere hearsay and were too indefi-
</p>
<p>nite and remote to base any motion upon. Moreover, if Ryce did make
</p>
<p>the remark in question to Favor, it does not appear that defendants were
</p>
<p>harmed by it. There is nothing to show that Ryce made any remarks of
</p>
<p>any kind, proper or improper, to the jurors whom he summoned. In addi-
</p>
<p>tion to this, it is not shown that the defendants served Favor with a sub-
</p>
<p>poena so as to lay a foundation for compelling his attendance.
</p>
<p>"We think that the course pursued on the trial in regard to the man-
</p>
<p>ner of impaneling the jury was correct and in accordance with the plain
</p>
<p>meaning of section 21, chapter 78, of the Revised Statutes. That section
</p>
<p>says ' that the jury shall be passed upon and accepted in panels of four by
</p>
<p>the parties, commencing with the plaintiff.' The State is not called upon
</p>
<p>to tender the defendants a second panel before the defendants tender it
</p>
<p>back four.
</p>
<p>" We can not see that the remarks of the State's Attorney in his argu-
</p>
<p>ment to the jury were marked by any such improprieties as require a
</p>
<p>reversal of the judgment. Wilson vs. The People, supra, and Garrity vs.

<p>" In their lengthy argument counsel for the defense make some other
</p>
<p>points of minor importance, which are not here noticed. As to these, it is
</p>
<p>sufficient to say that we have considered them and do not regard them as
</p>
<p>well taken.
</p>
<p>" The judgment of the Criminal Court of Cook County is affirmed."
</p>
<p>After the reading of the decision, Justice Mulkey stated that it had
</p>
<p>been his intention, if health had permitted, to file a separate opinion. He
</p>
<p>said :
</p>
<p>"While I concur in the conclusion reached, and also in the general view
</p>
<p>presented in the opinion filed, I do not wish to be understood as holding
</p>
<p>that the record is free from error, for I do not think it is. I am nevertheless
</p>
<p>of opinion that none of the errors complained of are of so serious a char-
</p>
<p>acter as to require a reversal of the judgment.
</p>
<p>" In view of the number of defendants on trial, the great length of time
</p>
<p>it was in progress, the vast amount of testimony offered and passed upon
</p>
<p>by the court, and the almost numberless rulings the court was required to
</p>
<p>THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION. 619
</p>
<p>make, the wonder with me is, that the errors were not more numerous and
</p>
<p>more serious than they are.
</p>
<p>" In short, after having carefully examined the record, and given all the
</p>
<p>questions arising upon it my very best thought, with an earnest and con-
</p>
<p>scientious desire to faithfully discharge my whole duty, I am .satisfied fully
</p>
<p>that the conclusion reached vindicates the law, does complete justice be-
</p>
<p>tween the prisoners and the State, and that it is fully warranted by the law

</p>
<p>IN spite of this overwhelming defeat at the hands of the Supreme Court of
</p>
<p>Illinois, counsel for the Anarchists did not lose hope. They at once set
</p>
<p>about formulating plans to carry their case before the highest tribunal under
</p>
<p>the law, the Supreme Court of the United States, and for some time they
</p>
<p>labored unremittingly in preparing the necessary grounds on which to bring
</p>
<p>the matter within the jurisdistion of that court. The point on which they
</p>
<p>mainly relied was a constitutional question involving the validity of the jury
</p>
<p>law of the State of Illinois, but time was necessary to put in proper shape
</p>
<p>other questions incidental to the main issue, growing out of rulings in the
</p>
<p>trial court. Meanwhile money was needed, just as it had been during
</p>
<p>the trial and the appeal to the State Supreme Court. It had been resolved
</p>
<p>to call into the service of the convicted men eminent constitutional lawyers,
</p>
<p>of national reputation as well as of high standing before the highest tribu-
</p>
<p>nal in the land, and contributions were accordingly sought throughout the
</p>
<p>country by the Anarchist "Defense Committee" of Chicago, a body which
</p>
<p>had been organized preceding the trial. In compliance with the call, a
</p>
<p>great deal of money was subscribed, and the local counsel began to cast
</p>
<p>about for legal assistance among the most noted constitutional expounders
</p>
<p>in the Union, to properly prepare the case for presentation at Washington.
</p>
<p>Capt. Black, to whom this duty seems to have been mainly intrusted, finally
</p>
<p>decided upon Gen. Pryor, of New York, and J. Randolph Tucker, and with
</p>
<p>these eminent jurists he held long consultations on the best points to make
</p>
<p>before the court of last resort. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler was also called
</p>
<p>into the case as special counsel for Spies and Fielden.
</p>
<p>Finally, on Thursday, October 27, 1887, the case was brought before the
</p>
<p>United States Supreme Court, and arguments were heard before a full

<p>bench. Mr. Tucker was the first to speak, and held the court's attention
</p>
<p>for some time, contending that the Illinois jury law was in contravention
</p>
<p>of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
</p>
<p>That amendment, he said, had been adopted, and had been construed by
</p>
<p>the court as for the special protection of the negro, and he insisted that it
</p>
<p>should be opened up for the protection of the whites as well. Upon this

</p>
<p>point he elaborated at some length, consuming nearly the whole time allot-
</p>
<p>ted to him, and then he proceeded to show that an impartial jury had not
</p>
<p>been chosen in the trial court, some men upon it reference being made to
</p>
<p>Denker and Sandford having formed a newspaper opinion, but, in spite of
</p>
<p>that fact, having still been admitted under the rulings of the court. The
</p>
<p>first ten amendments to the Constitution, he held, limited the States in the
</p>
<p>adoption of laws abridging the rights of citizens. His whole argument
</p>
<p>received marked attention and was ably presented.
</p>
<p>Benjamin F. Butler made a few points in addition to those presented in
</p>
<p>his brief, but the main burden of his plea was that his clients, Spies and
</p>
<p>Fielden, were aliens and had come to this country under treaties made with
</p>
<p>Germany and England, long before the jury law of Illinois was passed.
</p>
<p>Attorney-General Hunt, of Illinois, replied to the various points made
</p>
<p>by the petitioners, showing that the Federal Constitution, in its first ten
</p>
<p>amendments, did not restrict the rights of a State in the regulation of jury
</p>
<p>selections, and that there was no refuge for any of the defendants under the
</p>
<p>treaties. It was an eloquent and masterly argument, and its effect on the
</p>
<p>court was subsequently shown in the decision, which closely followed in the
</p>
<p>line of Mr. Hunt's position on the matters in question.
</p>
<p>State's Attorney Grinnell was present simply to assist the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General in pointing out the salient features in the record of the trial court,
</p>
<p>with which he was so thoroughly familiar, but, on solicitation, he also ad-
</p>
<p>dressed the court at some length. He spoke with reference to some details
</p>
<p>in the trial, and made a clear and concise exposition of the case. He was
</p>
<p>followed by General Butler, who spoke at considerable length, but advanced
</p>
<p>no new points, except that he maintained that Spies had been compelled to
</p>
<p>testify against himself.
</p>
<p>The arguments occupied two days, and the court reserved its decision
</p>
<p>until Wednesday, November 2. On that day the court decided, on the
</p>
<p>claim that the first ten amendments to the Constitution limited the rights
</p>
<p>of a State in the passage of laws affecting personal rights, that they "were
</p>
<p>not intended to limit the powers of the State Government in respect to
</p>
<p>their own citizens, but to operate on the National Government alone."
</p>
<p>This had been decided more than fifty years before, and that decision had

</p>
<p>been steadily adhered to ever since. " It was contended in argument,"
</p>
<p>said the court, "that, although originally the first two amendments were
</p>
<p>adopted as limitations on Federal power, yet, in so far as they secure and
</p>
<p>recognize fundamental rights, common-law rights of the man, they make
</p>
<p>them privileges and immunities of the man as a citizen of the United States
</p>
<p>and cannot now be abridged by a State under the Fourteenth Amendment."
</p>
<p>The objections raised, in brief, were that a statute of the State, as construed
</p>
<p>by the court, deprived the petitioners of a trial by an impartial jury and
</p>
<p>that Spies was compelled to give evidence against himself. The statute to
</p>
<p>622 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>which special objection was made, continued the court, was approved
</p>
<p>March 12, 1874, and went into force on July i of that year. The claim set
</p>
<p>up by petitioners was that the trial court, acting under this law, compelled
</p>
<p>them against their will to submit to a trial by a jury that was not impar-
</p>
<p>tial, and thus deprived them of one of the fundamental rights they had as
</p>
<p>citizens of the United States under the Federal Constitution, and that if
</p>
<p>the sentence was carried out they would be deprived of their lives " without
</p>
<p>due process of law." The court then referred to the peremptory challenges
</p>
<p>allowed petitioners and held that with these the constitutional right of the
</p>
<p>accused had been maintained.
</p>
<p>"Although a juror called as a juryman," said the court, "may have
</p>
<p>formed an opinion based upon rumor or newspaper statement, he is still
</p>
<p>qualified as a juror if he states that he can fairly and impartially render a
</p>
<p>verdict thereon in accordance with the law and the evidence. Indeed, the
</p>
<p>rule of the statute of Illinois as construed by the trial court is not materially
</p>
<p>different from that which has been adopted by the courts in many other
</p>
<p>States without any legislation. We agree entirely with the Illinois Supreme
</p>
<p>Court in the opinion that the statute on its face, as construed by the trial
</p>
<p>court, is not repugnant to section 9 of article 2 of the Constitution of that
</p>
<p>State, which guarantees to the accused party in every criminal prosecution
</p>
<p>a speedy trial by an impartial jury of the county or district in which the
</p>
<p>offense is alleged to have been committed."
</p>
<p>Speaking of the alleged bias of one of the jurors Denker the court
</p>
<p>says that neither party at the close of the examination challenged the juror
</p>
<p>peremptorily. "When this occurred it was not denied," says the court,
</p>
<p>"that the defendants were still entitled to 143 peremptory challenges, or
</p>
<p>about that number." As to Juror Sandford, the court said that "at the
</p>
<p>close of his examination on the part of the defendants the juror was chal-
</p>
<p>lenged on their behalf for cause, and the attorney for the State, after having
</p>
<p>ascertained that all the peremptory challenges of the defendants had been
</p>
<p>exhausted, took up the examination of the juror." It then appearing that
</p>
<p>he could render an impartial verdict, he was sworn in under the proper rul-
</p>
<p>ings of the court.
</p>
<p>As to Spies being compelled to be a witness against himself, the court

</p>
<p>ruled that, inasmuch as he had voluntarily offered himself as a witness in his
</p>
<p>own behalf, by so doing he had become bound to submit himself to a proper
</p>
<p>cross-examination. But it was said that the reading of Most's letter was
</p>
<p>not proper evidence. " That is," continued the court, "a question of State
</p>
<p>law in the courts of the States, and not of Federal law. " Something was
</p>
<p>said about the alleged unreasonable search and seizure of the papers and
</p>
<p>property of some of the defendants, and their use in evidence in the trial of
</p>
<p>the case. Special reference was made to letters from Most to Spies, about
</p>
<p>which he was cross-examined; but "we have," said the court, "not been

</p>
<p>referred to any part of the record in which it appears that objection was
</p>
<p>made to the use of the evidence on that account," and therefore, "as the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court of Illinois says so, we cannot consider the constitutional
</p>
<p>question involved."
</p>
<p>The writ of error prayed for in the petitions and briefs filed and the
</p>
<p>arguments made on their merits was therefore denied.
</p>
<p>The late Chief Justice Waite read the decision, and there was not a dis-
</p>
<p>senting opinion, thus overwhelmingly sustaining the most important rulings
</p>
<p>made by Judge Gary and attesting the impregnable position taken by the
</p>
<p>State.
</p>
<p>The prisoners in the Cook County Jail were now confronted with the
</p>
<p>awful fate in store for them nine days hence from the rendering of the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court's decision. But, like drowning men grasping at straws,
</p>
<p>they turned in the direction of executive clemency. Their counsel, Capt.
</p>
<p>Black especially, entertained strong hopes of securing from Gov. Oglesby
</p>
<p>a commutation of sentence to imprisonment in the penitentiary. Steps
</p>
<p>were accordingly taken looking to that end. Petitions to the chief ex-
</p>
<p>ecutive of Illinois were at once put in circulation for signatures, and friends
</p>
<p>and sympathizers of the condemned busied themselves in writing personal
</p>
<p>letters pleading for mercy.
</p>
<p>As the day of execution approached, it was surprising to note how many,
</p>
<p>who had hitherto clamored for blood in atonement for the Haymarket
</p>
<p>massacre, now exerted themselves in the effort to secure executive clemency.
</p>
<p>With my own eyes I saw people who had made the most fuss shouting,
</p>
<p>" Hang the Anarchists! Don't give them a chance for their lives. Des-
</p>
<p>troy them at once. They must be roasted out ; the balance of them must
</p>
<p>leave the country," the first to weaken. They began calling the doomed
</p>
<p>Anarchists " poor innocent men ; it is too bad to hang them. If they would
</p>
<p>only promise to do better hereafter, the authorities ought to let them go. '*
</p>
<p>There were others, again, who wished to see the laws enforced, but who
</p>
<p>failed to make their true feelings known during the interval immediately
</p>
<p>preceding the day set for the execution. These, when it became almost
</p>
<p>certain that the Anarchists must hang, showed themselves very firm and
</p>
<p>openly declared that the men fully deserved hanging, and should be hanged

<p>as determined by the verdict of the jury.
</p>
<p>Some of those who had given their moral support to the prosecution
</p>
<p>even went to the extent of giving up rooms in their residences for meetings
</p>
<p>of parties interested in imploring executive clemency, and avowed Anar-
</p>
<p>chists and Socialists spread their feet under mahogany tables and shuffled
</p>
<p>dirt-laden shoes over velvety rugs in houses that had hitherto sheltered
</p>
<p>owners who, on the streets and in the marts of trade, had denounced the
</p>
<p>Anarchists in unmeasured terms. But there were those who believed, from
</p>
<p>the conclusion of the trial up to the last moment, that the law should take
</p>
<p>624 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>its course, and these were largely in the majority. Governor Oglesby is
</p>
<p>made of stern material, but the most stern and rugged natures, with the
</p>
<p>clearest perceptions of duty and the most absolute belief in guilt, would
</p>
<p>have yielded to public sentiment as being the best guide in a case involving
</p>
<p>the lives of human, fallible beings. Really public sentiment upheld the ver-
</p>
<p>dict, and only yielded in the abatement of the sentence of Fielden and
</p>
<p>Schwab as justified by the mitigating circumstances in their cases.
</p>
<p>The day drew near for decisive action, and, on the gth of November,
</p>
<p>Capt. Black, accompanied by his wife, George Schilling, Mrs. Schwab, Mrs.
</p>
<p>and Miss Spies, Miss Engel, Miss Mueller, Lingg's sweetheart, and Mrs.
</p>
<p>Fischer, repaired to the Capitol at Springfield, to personally intercede for
</p>
<p>mercy. The " Amnesty Committee," organized shortly before to arouse
</p>
<p>interest in preventing the execution, was represented by Cora L. V. Rich-
</p>
<p>mond, a noted trance-spiritualistic exhorter, and a few others of less renown.
</p>
<p>Mr. W. M. Salter, of the Ethical Society of Chicago, Gen. M. M. Trum-
</p>
<p>bull, Henry D. Lloyd and S. P. McConnell also proceeded to the State
</p>
<p>capital on special missions in behalf of one or the other of the Anarchists,
</p>
<p>and besides there was a large sprinkling of labor representatives. Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor Oglesby, who had meanwhile accumulated a voluminous mass of
</p>
<p>letters and had received lengthy petitions from Chicago and all other parts
</p>
<p>of the country, even from the Commune of Paris, met the various delega-
</p>
<p>tions in his office in the Executive Department.
</p>
<p>The first speaker was Capt. Black, who presented a long petition, which
</p>
<p>he read, signed by Schwab, Fielden and Spies. It set forth the grounds
</p>
<p>upon which an exercise of the pardoning power was invoked, claiming that
</p>
<p>the signers were wholly innocent of any knowledge of the throwing of the
</p>
<p>bomb, and giving a brief epitome of the, history of the case. It gave ten
</p>
<p>reasons for asking a pardon. These reasons may be summarized as follows :
</p>
<p>1. They were innocent of the bomb-throwing, alike in act and intent.
</p>
<p>2. They had no knowledge of any purpose or arrangement for the throw-
</p>
<p>ing of the bomb. 3. They (those present) counseled peace at the Hay-
</p>
<p>market meeting and there disclaimed any purpose of violence. 4. A great
</p>
<p>deal of evidence was permitted to be presented in court which had no spe-
</p>
<p>cific reference to the crime charged, and an effort was made to prove that

</p>
<p>their utterances and advice had reference alone to "defensive action by the
</p>
<p>wage class as against any unlawful attacks upon them," and in thus pub-
</p>
<p>licly expressing their sentiments by pen and speech they were not conscious
</p>
<p>that they were violating the law. 5. Under a rule of responsibility allowed,
</p>
<p>which was contrary to Anglo-Saxon legislation but expressed in the statute
</p>
<p>law of the State, they were held to be accessories " for the act of a supposed
</p>
<p>but absolutely unknown and unidentified principal, when the actor in the
</p>
<p>commission of the crime charged may have acted, not as the agent, but the
</p>
<p>enemy, of the accused ;" and they had been tried as "the supposed leaders
</p>
<p>ASKING EXECUTIVE CLEMENCY, 625
</p>
<p>of a general movement or conspiracy embracing a much larger number of
</p>
<p>men." 6. Their trial was at a time of great public excitement, when press
</p>
<p>and public demanded their conviction as enemies of public order. 7. That
</p>
<p>men were allowed to sit upon the jury with strong prejudices against them.
</p>
<p>8. They were not tried by men according to constitutional rights, but had
</p>
<p>jurors "with a prejudgment of their guilt induced and inflamed by the daily
</p>
<p>reading of the papers," whose columns had never ceased to denounce them,
</p>
<p>9. Some of them were subjected to illegal cross-examinations, and " the pro-
</p>
<p>visions of the Constitution and the law were set aside, and property unlaw-
</p>
<p>fully seized in unauthorized searches was introduced to bring about a con-
</p>
<p>viction. " 10. They believed and charged that the special bailiff who was
</p>
<p>intrusted with securing talesmen for the jury had deliberately selected men
</p>
<p>whose views he was assured were hostile to them.
</p>
<p>Capt. Black commented upon each -point made in the petition, and ex-
</p>
<p>plained that up to the time of the Haymarket meeting his clients had had
</p>
<p>the absolute, uniform acquiescence of the municipal authorities in all their
</p>
<p>public and secret gatherings. He also read an affidavit of Otis S. Favor, to-
</p>
<p>show that the bailiff had said to affiant that he was " managing this case '*
</p>
<p>(meaning selection of the jury to try the Anarchists) and "he knew what he
</p>
<p>was about."
</p>
<p>The plea was an eloquent and forcible one, but the Governor never gave
</p>
<p>the slightest sign as to how far it had affected his judgment of the case.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Richmond spoke with reference to the petitions which her committee
</p>
<p>had presented, containing many signatures, and explained that " the major-
</p>
<p>ity of those who had signed them had done so because they considered it a
</p>
<p>matter of public policy that these men should not be hanged." Another
</p>
<p>reason she advanced was that " these men did not intend a murder, and the
</p>
<p>fact cannot be, shown that they had any direct connection in the throwing of
</p>
<p>the bomb which caused the death of Officer Degan." She held that public
</p>
<p>opinion was unanimous that these men could not afford to be sacrificed.
</p>
<p>"The shock upon the rising generation will be such that it will take fifty or
</p>
<p>one hundred years to wipe it out, and we believe it never could be wiped
</p>
<p>out from the records of this State." She asked that the sentence be com-
</p>
<p>muted " on the higher ground that it should be done for the welfare of the

</p>
<p>people," and then, after deploring the existence of capital punishment in
</p>
<p>Illinois, she said that if mercy was shown by the Governor, his name would
</p>
<p>forever be written on the scroll of humanity along with that of the martyred
</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln. " I again implore you, sir, to extend clemency to these
</p>
<p>condemned men, and enroll your name among those who have dared to do
</p>
<p>for humanity what all the courts of the land have denied."
</p>
<p>Gen. M. M. Trumbull had had a pamphlet prepared respecting the trial,
</p>
<p>and after presenting a copy of it to the Governor, and calling attention to
</p>
<p>the fact that he had therein reviewed the unfairness of the trial, he made a
</p>
<p>626 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>few remarks, closing as follows : " In behalf of the families of these men ; in
</p>
<p>behalf of the men themselves ; in behalf of thousands and hundreds of
</p>
<p>thousands of people who sympathize with them in their misfortunes, I
</p>
<p>implore your Excellency to show mercy in their case."
</p>
<p>Elijah M. Haines, ex-Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives,
</p>
<p>said : " I do not come here, your Excellency, like others, to appeal to the
</p>
<p>executive of this State to exercise an act of clemency ; neither do I come
</p>
<p>here representing petitioners. But I come here representing a sentiment
</p>
<p>appealing to the executive branch of the government for an act of justice."
</p>
<p>His plea was based simply on the ground of justice, not policy, and he held
</p>
<p>that what had been a crime years ago was not a crime now, and that "this
</p>
<p>sentence, at this time, would not have been the sentence of the barbarous race
</p>
<p>that preceded us." He held that no conspiracy had been proven, and that
</p>
<p>the men had been condemned to die through prejudice. He did not believe
</p>
<p>in capital punishment, and concluded that "the peculiar complication of this
</p>
<p>case would make the execution of these men hazardous to the best interests
</p>
<p>of society."
</p>
<p>State Senator Streeter made a short address. He began by saying :
</p>
<p>"We are not here to favor any crime, but we do believe that this case
</p>
<p>marks an epoch in our history ; that you and I, Governor, and the people
</p>
<p>who are living, probably never met or never will again meet an emergency
</p>
<p>in history like this. It is almost without parallel." He then pleaded for
</p>
<p>clemency on the ground of " the common good of society," and asked the
</p>
<p>Governor to give the petition a careful consideration.
</p>
<p>Messrs. Bailey and Campbell, representing the Trades and Labor
</p>
<p>Assembly of Quincy, 111., each spoke a few words for the doomed men,
</p>
<p>and they were followed by William Urban, who spoke "for the German
</p>
<p>workingmen of North Chicago," and presented a set of resolutions passed
</p>
<p>by the Central Labor Union.
</p>
<p>L. S. Oliver, on behalf of the "Amnesty Committee," made a few state-
</p>
<p>ments and presented a petition containing 41,000 names.
</p>
<p>Mr. Shullenberg, of Detroit, Mich., said he represented forty-five or-
</p>
<p>ganizations, and he asked, on their behalf, that executive clemency be
</p>
<p>extended.

</p>
<p>C. G. Dixon, of Chicago, also submitted a long petition, and addressed
</p>
<p>the Governor at some length. He was followed by Samuel Gompers, of
</p>
<p>New York, President of the American Federation of Labor, who went into
</p>
<p>an account of the eight-hour movement, and held that the police were
</p>
<p>responsible for the Haymarket riot. He said that thousands would consider
</p>
<p>that the men had been executed because they had stood up for free speech
</p>
<p>and free assemblage, and maintained that throughout the civilized world
</p>
<p>there had arisen a protest against the execution of the men. He concluded
</p>
<p>by saying that the throwing of that bomb had killed the eight-hour move-
</p>
<p>"FATAL FACILITY OF SPEECH." . 627
</p>
<p>ment, and that, had it not been for that, it would have been successful to a
</p>
<p>great extent.
</p>
<p>Other addresses were made by Edward King, of District Assembly 49,
</p>
<p>of New York ; President Quinn, of the same organization, and George
</p>
<p>Schilling. The various delegations then withdrew to permit the relatives
</p>
<p>of the doomed men to confer personally with the Governor, and then each
</p>
<p>in turn gave a few reasons why the Governor should be lenient.
</p>
<p>After this conference Mr. J. R. Buchanan and Mrs. George Schilling,
</p>
<p>accompanied by two friends, sought an audience with the Governor and
</p>
<p>presented a personal letter from August Spies. In that letter, dated
</p>
<p>November 6, among other things he wrote :
</p>
<p>" I care not to protest my innocence of any crime, and of the one I am
</p>
<p>accused of in particular. I have done that, and leave the rest to the judg-
</p>
<p>ment of history. ... If a sacrifice of life there must be, will not my life
</p>
<p>suffice ? The State's Attorney of Cook County asked for no more. Take
</p>
<p>this, then ! Take my life ! I offer it to you so that you may satisfy the
</p>
<p>fury of a semi-barbaric mob, and save that of my comrades."
</p>
<p>This extract fully indicates the whole tenor of the letter.
</p>
<p>Messrs. Salter, Lloyd and McConnell next visited the Governor and
</p>
<p>spoke on behalf of the men.
</p>
<p>Mr. Edward Johnson, a slate and stone dealer of Chicago, presented a
</p>
<p>petition on behalf of Fielden's former employers, numbering thirty-one
</p>
<p>firms, and in that document they set forth that they had known Fielden for
</p>
<p>fifteen years as an honest, hard-working, sober, reliable employe, with no
</p>
<p>brutal or bloody instincts, and that the only trouble with him was that " he
</p>
<p>was cursed with a gift of rude eloquence, a fatal facility of speech, and had
</p>
<p>a consuming desire for the praise and applause of his fellow-men, and in
</p>
<p>this lay the cause of his downfall."
</p>
<p>This petition was accompanied by a personal letter from Fielden, dated
</p>
<p>November 5, 1887. After speaking of his earlier years, and his interest in
</p>
<p>the cause of workingmen, the letter concludes :
</p>
<p>" I was intoxicated with the applause of my hearers, and, the more vio-
</p>
<p>lent my language, the more applause I received. My audience and myself
</p>
<p>mutually excited each other. I think, however, it is true that, for sensa-

<p>tional or other purposes, words were put in my mouth and charged to me
</p>
<p>which I never uttered ; but, whether this be true or not, I say now that I no
</p>
<p>longer believe it proper that any class of society should attempt to right its
</p>
<p>own wrongs by violence. I can now see that much that I said under
</p>
<p>excitement was unwise, and all this I regret. It is not true, however, that
</p>
<p>I ever consciously attempted to incite any man to the commission of crime.
</p>
<p>Although I do admit that I belonged to an organization which was engaged
</p>
<p>at one time in preparing for a social revolution, I was not engaged in any
</p>
<p>conspiracy to manufacture or throw bombs. I never owned or carried a
</p>

</p>
<p>peaceable and orderly one, such as I had often addressed in this city, and
</p>
<p>was utterly astounded at its bloody outcome, and have always felt keenly
</p>
<p>the loss of life and suffering there occasioned.
</p>
<p>" In view of these facts I respectfully submit that, while I confess with
</p>
<p>regret the use of extravagant and unjustifiable words, I am not a murderer.
</p>
<p>I never had any murderous intent, and I humbly pray relief from the mur-
</p>
<p>derer's doom. That these statements are true I do again solemnly affirm
</p>
<p>by every tie that I hold sacred, and I hope that your Excellency will give a
</p>
<p>considerate hearing to the merits of my case, and also to those of my im-
</p>
<p>prisoned companions who have been sentenced with me."
</p>
<p>Judge Gary and Mr. Grinnell also wrote a letter setting forth this
</p>
<p>natural desire of Fielden's for applause and saying that there was no evi-
</p>
<p>dence showing that he knew of any preparations to throw the bomb. They
</p>
<p>believed him to have been an honest and industrious man and thought exec-
</p>
<p>utive clemency in his case would be justifiable.
</p>
<p>A letter from Schwab was also presented to the Governor. It was short
</p>
<p>and read as follows :
</p>
<p>" As supplemental to the petition heretofore signed by me, I desire to
</p>
<p>say that I realize that many utterances of mine in connection with the labor
</p>
<p>agitation of the past, expressions made under intense excitement, and often
</p>
<p>without any deliberation, were injudicious. These I regret, believing that
</p>
<p>they must have had a tendency to incite to unnecessary violence oftentimes.
</p>
<p>I protest again that I had no thought or purpose of violence in connection
</p>
<p>with the Haymarket meeting, which I did not even attend, and that I have
</p>
<p>always deplored the results of that meeting."
</p>
<p>This was accompanied by a letter from Judge Gary, concurring with
</p>
<p>State's Attorney Grinnell's opinion that Schwab's case deserved considera-
</p>
<p>tion, as the man was friendless and had evidently been the pliant tool of
</p>
<p>stronger-willed men. George C. Ingham also wrote, saying that if execu-
</p>
<p>tive clemency was shown to Fielden and Schwab it would not be misplaced.
</p>
<p>While the case was thus being discussed at Springfield, Parsons, Lingg,
</p>
<p>Engel and Fischer were strongly urged by their friends to send personal
</p>
<p>letters appealing for clemency, but each absolutely refused. They wrote
</p>
<p>letters to the Governor, but declared that they would not accept a pardon

<p>unless it restored them to full liberty. They held that they had committed
</p>
<p>no wrong, and hence could seek no clemency except that which would re-
</p>
<p>lease them from imprisonment.
</p>
<p>On the same day that the delegations appeared befor the Governor, Mr.
</p>
<p>Vere V. Hunt went before Judge Richard J. Prendergast, of the County
</p>
<p>Court in Chicago, and filed a petition to try the sanity of Lingg. He gave
</p>
<p>as witnesses Dr. James G. Kiernan, George E. Detwiler, Ferdinand
</p>
<p>Spies, Ida Spies, Henry Spies, Chris Spies, Mr. Kuttleman, Gustav Poch,
</p>
<p>Louis Zetter, Mr. Linnemeyer and W. Bentthin. After arguments, Judge
</p>
<p>Prendergast held that, in view of the judgment of the Supreme Court, affirm-
</p>
<p>ing the sentence of the Criminal Court, he had no jurisdiction. The next

</p>
<p>629
</p>
<p>-day Mr. Hunt presented the same petition to Judge Frank Baker, but, after
</p>
<p>hearing arguments, the court declined to examine into the question of the
</p>
<p>bomb-maker's sanity.
</p>
<p>Another curious move was also made on behalf of Parsons on the day
</p>
<p>preceding the execution. It was an application for a writ of habeas corpus
</p>
<p>by Attorney Salomon, and was presented before Judge M. F. Tuley. The
</p>
<p>.grounds on which it was based were that the judgment affirmed by the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court was directed against seven men and not against one, and
</p>
<p>that the prisoner, not being in court when the sentence was passed, could
</p>
<p>not be executed under it. He also claimed that the death warrant was not
</p>
<p>legal because it did not run in the name of the people of the State of Illi-
</p>
<p>nois. Judge Tuley said the court had no power to correct any errors of
</p>
<p>the Supreme Court, and that the prisoner was
</p>
<p>legally in the custody of the Sheriff, and the ap-
</p>
<p>plication would accordingly be denied.
</p>
<p>While favorable results were being anticipated
</p>
<p>by some as to the Governor's decision, an incident
</p>
<p>occurred which dampened their expectations and
</p>
<p>somewhat affected public sentiment in the belief of
</p>
<p>the guilt of the conspirators. Although it proba-
</p>
<p>bly had no effect on the Governor's decision, An-
</p>
<p>archists at large thought it would highly prejudice
</p>
<p>the case of their friends at his hands. This inci-
</p>
<p>dent was the horrible suicide of Louis Lingg.
</p>
<p>While the Anarchists were confined in the
</p>
<p>Cook County Jail they were quartered in that por-
</p>
<p>tion of the premises known as "murderers' row."
</p>
<p>This row faces south on the first gallery, in view
</p>
<p>of the entrance to the jail corridor, and had been
</p>
<p>.so designated because in times past men accused
</p>
<p>of murder and awaiting trial, or men convicted of murder and awaiting exe-
</p>
<p>cution of sentence, were kept in the cells on that tier. Lingg, the most
</p>
<p>defiant Anarchist of them all, occupied cell No. 22 ; Engel, No. 23 ; Spies,

<p>No. 24 ; Schwab, No. 26 ; Fielden, No. 27, and Fischer, No. 28. During
</p>
<p>Neebe's detention, before being taken to the penitentiary, he occupied cell

<p>No. 21. All the prisoners were subjected to strict prison discipline. The
</p>
<p>rules of the jail knew no relaxation in the case of any one brought into
</p>
<p>that part of the establishment, and each regulation was carried out to the
</p>
<p>very letter.
</p>
<p>Jailor Folz is a veteran in the service, having filled the jailorship off and
</p>
<p>on for twenty-two years, and he thoroughly understands all the requirements
</p>
<p>in the way of jail discipline, to prevent escapes and guard against suicides
</p>
<p>and assaults. I know him well, and he always has one ear and one eye open

</p>
<p>to the conduct of the prisoners and the other eye and ear for his own security,
</p>
<p>like a sailor who gives one-half of his body to the ship and reserves the other
</p>
<p>half for his own safety. Where so many desperate characters are confined
</p>
<p>it requires the utmost vigilance to keep them under control and restrain them
</p>
<p>from violent outbreaks. Men whose lives have been almost a continual
</p>
<p>record of misdeeds, crimes and murders are not, as a rule, easily handled,
</p>
<p>and the wonder is that there have been so few to create trouble in Folz's
</p>
<p>bailiwick.
</p>
<p>One of the rules is a regular inspection of all the cells for contraband
</p>
<p>articles and the exclusion of all implements calculated to aid a prisoner in
</p>
<p>effecting his escape. Sometimes a revolver may be found during these in-
</p>
<p>spections ; at other times a tiny saw for cutting the bars, and then again
</p>
<p>some tool for cutting through the flagstones with a view to reaching the air-
</p>
<p>shaft or getting into the sewer underneath ; and, though rarely, even smug-
</p>
<p>gled poison has been discovered.
</p>
<p>All prisoners are carefully searched before being locked up, but it fre-
</p>
<p>quently happens that prisoners are permitted to talk with their friends
</p>
<p>through the lawyers' cage. This cage is an inclosure ten by sixteen feet in
</p>
<p>dimensions, with iron bars and strong wires, and while it would seem im-
</p>
<p>possible to pass anything through the narrow interstices, now and then an
</p>
<p>aperture is pried open wide enough to pass in contraband articles. In
</p>
<p>this way many things have been found smuggled into the jail. Food and
</p>
<p>delicacies handed into the jail office for prisoners are always carefully
</p>
<p>examined, and this precaution was particularly exercised in the case of
</p>
<p>the Anarchists as the time approached for their execution.
</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, November 6, 1887, Mr. Folz gave orders about
</p>
<p>eight o'clock to have the cells of the Anarchists searched, and Deputies
</p>
<p>John Eagan and O. E. Hogan were detailed for that purpose. Lingg's cell
</p>
<p>was first examined, and while the search proceeded he was locked up in
</p>
<p>the "lawyers' cage." A lot of revolutionary books, copies of the Arbeiter-
</p>
<p>Zeitung and other papers were taken out and thrown temporarily in the
</p>
<p>corridor. In one corner of the room stood a ten-pound starch-box, in one
</p>
<p>nook of which there was a kerosene lamp, about which again some onions
</p>
<p>were piled. Box and onions were placed on the gallery platform for the

</p>
<p>time being.
</p>
<p>The officers were next about to proceed to a search of Engel's cell, but
</p>
<p>just before doing so Hogan happened to kick box, onions and all over the
</p>
<p>platform, down onto the main floor. At the time some of the prisoners,
</p>
<p>who were exercising themselves in the corridor, got curious as to the
</p>
<p>contents of the rubbish, and, in the hope of finding something they might
</p>
<p>desire, began a search of the pile. Some of them seemed particularly
</p>
<p>interested in something they had discovered, and Hogan, noticing their
</p>
<p>intent gaze, stopped to look at the*m. He noticed that one of the prisoners
</p>
<p>THE SUICIDE BOMBS. 631
</p>
<p>i
</p>
<p>had something strange in his hands. Eagan also noticed the same thing
</p>
<p>and started on a run down-stairs. Arriving at the place where the knot of
</p>
<p>prisoners had gathered, he found that the curious object which they were
</p>
<p>scrutinizing was nothing else than a dynamite bomb. The bomb, it
</p>
<p>appears, had been dashed out of the box as it fell on the floor from the
</p>
<p>gallery platform above, and interest at once centered in the innocent-
</p>
<p>looking box. Mr. Eagan found therein three other bombs, and they were
</p>
<p>immediately taken to Jailor Folz's office. The box was next carefully
</p>
<p>examined, and it was found to have a false bottom, in which the bombs had
</p>
<p>been concealed. Some six days before this box had been brought into
</p>
<p>the jail, and, being apparently empty, it had been passed in to Lingg. It
</p>
<p>was evident that it had been made according to Lingg's instructions by
</p>
<p>some handy carpenter who was a close friend, and, judging from its
</p>
<p>construction, it seems to have been patterned after Lingg's trunk, which,
</p>
<p>it will be remembered, also had a false bottom, and in whose secret apart-
</p>
<p>ment I found a lot of dynamite, together with a coil of fuse and a supply
</p>
<p>of caps. Either the bombs were in the box at the time it was brought to
</p>
<p>the jail, or they must have been smuggled in through a temporarily-forced
</p>
<p>opening in the wire cage. The officials incline to the former theory.
</p>
<p>Lingg was a most interested spectator. It was evident from his actions
</p>
<p>that the discovery greatly troubled him. His face became almost livid
</p>
<p>with rage, his eyes fairly snapped fire, and he fumed in his cage like an im-
</p>
<p>prisoned beast of prey. He was speechless with anger, and every motion
</p>
<p>betrayed an energy of passion that was fearful to behold.
</p>
<p>After a little while Lingg was taken out of the "lawyers' cage," and
</p>
<p>thereafter he was confined in a cell fixed up for him on the lower floor, where
</p>
<p>he could be directly under the eyes of the officials, who by this time had
</p>
<p>come to regard him as a very dangerous man. At ten o'clock on the same
</p>
<p>morning, I received a dispatch from the Sheriff asking me to call at the
</p>
<p>jail immediately. Arriving there, I met Sheriff Matson and Jailor Folz, and
</p>
<p>after they had explained the circumstances of the morning's find, the four
</p>
<p>bombs were handed to me for examination. I found that they were all
</p>
<p>loaded with dynamite of the regular kind, and I gave it as my opinion that

</p>
<p>they were manifestly intended for suicidal purposes, to escape the gallows.
</p>
<p>I could not believe that they were made for any other purpose. Both the
</p>
<p>Sheriff and the Jailor concurred in this view, and they so expressed them-
</p>
<p>selves to outsiders, although sensational reports were circulated in the
</p>
<p>newspapers that the bombs were smuggled in to be used especially on the
</p>
<p>day of the execution, to blow the jail, prisoners and visitors to the four
</p>
<p>winds.
</p>
<p>I took charge of the bombs, ajid subsequently, at the station, gave them
</p>
<p>a more thorough examination. They were all of the same size, being six
</p>
<p>inches long, three-eighth gas-pipe, and one end of each had been plugged
</p>
<p>632
</p>
<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>with a boiler rivet one inch long. On each rivet there had been cut
</p>
<p>about a dozen notches with a sharp chisel, and after the rivets had been
</p>
<p>inserted hot lead had been poured into the pipe from the top, thus fasten-
</p>
<p>ing them in place. A wooden plug, through which a hole had been bored in
</p>
<p>the center for the cap and fuse, had been put at the other end of each pipe ;
</p>
<p>and thus plugged, with a charge of dynamite inside, it was a most destruc-
</p>
<p>tive implement. The dynamite used was of the regular factory make, the
</p>
<p>percussion cap of English manufacture, and the fuse of the tar-cloth, water-
</p>
<p>proof kind. The fuse was cut scarcely an inch long, and a fuse of that
</p>
<p>length would explode the cap as soon almost as it was ignited. I explained
</p>
<p>these features in a general way to Sheriff Matson and Jailor Folz, and told
</p>
<p>them that with such a short fuse no one using one of these deadly contriv-
</p>
<p>ances could light it and then throw the bomb away before it would explode.
</p>
<p>It might, as I explained to them, be kept about the body or inserted in a
</p>
<p>man's mouth, and in an instant after being lighted an explosion would follow.
</p>
<p>Hence my theory was that they were designed ex-
</p>
<p>clusively for suicidal purposes. A photographic il-
</p>
<p>lustration of the suicide bombs appears on page 595.
</p>
<p>The bomb used at the Haymarket was of the
</p>
<p>kind called the " five and six seconds fuse." The
</p>
<p>fuse on a bomb of that kind was cut at a length of
</p>
<p>four inches, and the instruction to Anarchists in
</p>
<p>handling one of them was to count four just as soon
</p>
<p>as the fuse caught fire, and then throw it. If the
</p>
<p>bombs found in Lingg's cell had had that length
</p>
<p>of fuse, then it might have been possible that they
</p>
<p>were intended for general destruction. These
</p>
<p>bombs had evidently been made under instruc-
</p>
<p>tions from Lingg. He was the only one who
</p>
<p>made bombs by plugging up one end with lead,
</p>
<p>and, whoever the party was that turned them out for him, he must have had
</p>
<p>some prior experience with Lingg in bomb-making. That could be plainly
</p>
<p>seen, too, in the way the fuse had been fastened in the caps. It was also mani-

</p>
<p>fest that the man must have been a machinist. But no clue as to his iden-
</p>
<p>tity could be secured, and, of course, Lingg never gave the slightest hint to
</p>
<p>any of the officers, or even to his associates.
</p>
<p>Thereafter, as might have been expected, Lingg was more carefully
</p>
<p>watched than ever. No strange visitors were permitted to see him. The
</p>
<p>discovery of the explosives had created an intense and widespread excite-
</p>
<p>ment, and Sheriff Matson issued most stringent orders with reference, not
</p>
<p>only to Lingg, but to all the other confined Anarchists. By these orders
</p>
<p>the public was measurably reassured.

</p>
<p>constituting its outfit had been subjected to the closest inspection. It
</p>
<p>seemed certain that there could be no dynamite in that cell. Besides this,
</p>
<p>Mr. Benjamin P. Price, the Jail Clerk, made it his special business to look
</p>
<p>after the desperate man, and there seemed no possibility of danger from
</p>
<p>that quarter.
</p>
<p>But on the morning of the ioth of November, at 8:45 o'clock, the officials
</p>
<p>as well as occupants of the jail were startled by the sound of a terrific ex-
</p>
<p>plosion. Consternation seized everybody for the moment. Each surmised
</p>
<p>that some sad havoc had been created in some portion of the jail, and that
</p>
<p>his special section had miraculously escaped. All within the jail precincts
</p>
<p>jumped to their feet, and the most eager inquiries were made as to the cause
</p>
<p>of the noise. Even the inmates of the cells in the immediate vicinity of
</p>
<p>the spot where the explosion had occurred thought that some other portion of
</p>
<p>the building had been blown up, and they were uncertain whether the attack
</p>
<p>had come from without or within.
</p>
<p>The first idea credited the explosion to confederates of the Anarchists
</p>
<p>on the outside. This was a perfectly natural conclusion. All sorts of
</p>
<p>rumors about violent demonstrations and forcible attempts at rescue of the
</p>
<p>doomed Anarchists were in circulation about the city, and the instant this
</p>
<p>detonation was heard it was supposed that the threats had been finally car-
</p>
<p>ried into effect. So loud was the report that people passing on the streets
</p>
<p>surrounding the jail imagined that fearful destruction must have been
</p>
<p>created inside. But after the first flush of excitement had subsided, the
</p>
<p>source of the commotion was easily and. speedily ascertained.
</p>
<p>The explosion had occurred in Lingg's cell. The night before Lingg
</p>
<p>had appeared in one of his complacent moods, and when the death-watch
</p>
<p>eyed him closely the next morning nothing unusual was discovered in his
</p>
<p>demeanor. Lingg seemed to be resting easily on his couch, and there was
</p>
<p>not the slightest indication that anything tragic was contemplated. While
</p>
<p>the death-watch, Deputy Sheriff Osborne, was giving his attention to some-
</p>
<p>thing else for a moment, however, Lingg saw his opportunity, rose steal-
</p>
<p>thily from his bed, seized a candle that flickered dimly in a corner of the
</p>
<p>cell, and, jumping back to his couch, put the bomb in his mouth and
</p>
<p>applied the flame. In an instant a loud explosion followed.

</p>
<p>Officials were soon in the cell and found Lingg lying on his side on the
</p>
<p>couch, with one arm thrown over his head and the other resting on a little
</p>
<p>table. A stream of blood was coursing down the pillow, and pools of it
</p>
<p>had gathered upon the bedding. The deputies raised him up gently. A
</p>
<p>ghastly sight met their gaze. The lower jaw had been almost entirely
</p>
<p>blown away, the upper lip was completely torn to shreds, the greater part
</p>
<p>of his nose was in tatters, only a fragment of his tongue remained, and
</p>
<p>every vestige of front teeth had disappeared. What remained of his
</p>
<p>cheeks looked like flesh torn by vultures, and every jagged part bled pro-
</p>
<p>LINGG'S HORRIBLE DEATH.
</p>
<p>635
</p>
<p>fusely. The inside of his upper jaw was horribly lacerated. It looked as
</p>
<p>though no man could survive such a wound for a moment after its infliction.
</p>
<p>And yet the bomb-maker was alive and breathing regularly.
</p>
<p>Lingg was at once removed from the cell to a large bath-room near
</p>
<p>the Jailor's office, and made as comfortable as circumstances would permit.
</p>
<p>Drs. Fenger, Moyer and Bluthardt were at once sent for, and they re-
</p>
<p>sponded immediately. They applied such restoratives as medical science
</p>
<p>suggested, but they found no little difficulty in stopping the bleeding and
</p>
<p>preventing the blood from running down the man's throat and interfering
</p>
<p>with his breathing. Now and then he coughed, and with each spell
</p>
<p>emitted large quantities of blood. The pallet upon, which he rested, and
</p>
<p>the floor under-
</p>
<p>neath, were satu-
</p>
<p>rated with blood,
</p>
<p>and its strong

<p>who entered the room and seemed surprised at their consternation. It was
</p>
<p>only when some police officers entered to look at him that he showed signs
</p>
<p>of nervousness, and then, with pantomimic flourishes of his hand, he indi-
</p>
<p>cated that he desired them to leave. The signs were correctly interpreted ;
</p>
<p>for the moment the officers left he quieted down easily, and a grateful look
</p>
<p>from his eyes expressed his satisfaction. John C. Klein, who afterwards
</p>
<p>became famous for the active part he took in the troubles in the island of

<p>ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>Chicago dailies, and in that capacity was present in the room. While still
</p>
<p>being operated upon, Lingg beckoned to Klein for pencil and paper, and,
</p>
<p>these being handed to him, he wrote, in German : " Please support my back.
</p>
<p>When- I lie down I cannot breathe." That piece of paper, stained with
</p>
<p>Lingg's' blood, is still in existence, and is shown in the engraving.
</p>
<p>Everything was done to alleviate Lingg's sufferings, but he died at 2:45
</p>
<p>that afternoon.
</p>
<p>The bomb-maker's remains were placed in a neat coffin, and Bailiff
</p>
<p>Eagan was detailed to critically examine Lingg's cell. It was discovered
</p>
<p>that when Lingg had lighted the bomb, which had been placed firmly
</p>
<p>between the teeth, he was reclining on his cot, with his head near the wall.
</p>
<p>This was indicated by the fact that Eagan found portions of the man's
</p>
<p>mustache, pieces of the tongue and shreds of flesh clinging firmly to the wall
</p>
<p>nearest where the head had rested. A piece of the tallow candle which
</p>
<p>had stood before its tragic use in a corner of the cell was found in the bed,
</p>
<p>and the wall where the head had lain was not only marred by the almost
</p>
<p>direct force of the explosion, but thickly bespattered with blood. All this
</p>
<p>indicated unmistakably the means Lingg had used to light the bomb and
</p>
<p>the position he had assumed when applying the fatal spark.
</p>
<p>The bomb- used was undoubtedly simi-
</p>
<p>lar to the lot discovered a few days previ-
</p>
<p>ously. But how it became separated and
</p>
<p>in what manner it was concealed and
</p>
<p>smuggled into Lingg's hands after he had
</p>
<p>been placed in a new cell and put under
</p>
<p>strict surveillance, are matters of conjec-
</p>
<p>ture. My own theory is that Lingg had
</p>
<p>a confidential friend among the smaller
</p>
<p>I class of criminals. To such a friend this
</p>
<p>1 bomb was intrusted for safe-keeping in the
</p>
<p>I event of the discovery of the bombs in his
</p>
<p>own cell, and when they were found he
</p>
<p>relied on that trusted friend to help him

<p>could this bomb have come into the pos-

</p>
<p>been searched several times and nothing found upon him. A confederate
</p>
<p>must have carefully kept the bomb and smuggled it to him at the last
</p>
<p>moment. Everything indicated that the bomb had been part of the dis-
</p>
<p>covered explosives, and its use fully corroborated the opinion I had given to
</p>
<p>Sheriff Matson and Jailor Folz at the time of the find, that the bombs were
</p>
<p>only intended for suicidal purposes and had been brought into the jail for
</p>
<p>no other object. At the time this opinion was given I was severely criti-
</p>
<p>GOV. OGLESBY'S ACTION. 637
</p>
<p>cised by Chief Ebersold and others the newspapers especially for ad-
</p>
<p>vancing such a theory. They maintained that the bombs had been brought
</p>
<p>in to be thrown at the time of the execution, so as not only to kill all who
</p>
<p>might become spectators, but to enable the Anarchists to escape hanging
</p>
<p>by death in the general destruction around them. A few of the papers even
</p>
<p>went so far as to attribute the opinion to "Schaack's stupidity."
</p>
<p>The doomed Anarchists were closely watched when it became quite ap-
</p>
<p>parent that there was no chance of their escaping the gallows either through
</p>
<p>an intervention of the courts or through executive clemency. Before this,
</p>
<p>however, some latitude had been allowed them. They had been watched,
</p>
<p>of course, but the rigorous scrutiny subsequently adopted had not then
</p>
<p>prevailed. Visitors had been admitted, and, although separate conversa-
</p>
<p>tions had not been permitted, prisoners and friends had been close together.
</p>
<p>No contraband articles had ever been noticed, however, the general opinion
</p>
<p>among the jail officials being that, considering the prisoners were so hope-
</p>
<p>ful of good results from the labors of their counsel, such a thing as suicide
</p>
<p>was not contemplated by any one of them.
</p>
<p>The first thing to arouse Jailor Folz's suspicion was Engel's action one
</p>
<p>day about the ist of November. It appears that at that time Engel was
</p>
<p>very nervous and restless, and secured some morphine to quiet his/ nerves.
</p>
<p>He took an over-dose, and when charged with having deliberately done so
</p>
<p>with suicidal intent, he stoutly maintained that he had taken too much by
</p>
<p>mistake. Folz thought no man could take such a dose except with a view
</p>
<p>to suicide, and he resolved to keep a close watch on Engel thereafter and
</p>
<p>allow him no medicine save what was administered by a physician. The
</p>
<p>others were also more closely watched after that episode. All were searched
</p>
<p>at stated intervals, as I have already mentioned.
</p>
<p>One day, while Parsons was being searched, he was handed a common
</p>
<p>white shirt by Otto Folz, a son of the Jailor. Parsons looked at it for a
</p>
<p>moment and then exclaimed :
</p>
<p>" My God ! you are not going to put a shroud on a live man ?"
</p>
<p>After the bomb discovery the doomed Anarchists were removed from
</p>
<p>their old cells and placed on the lower floor, along the tier containing
</p>
<p>Lingg's cell. Parsons was put in cell No. 7 ; Fischer, No. 8, and Engel,

<p>No. 9. When Lingg had been removed to the bath-room, his comrades
</p>
<p>were again subjected to an examinaton, and their clothes were all changed
</p>
<p>in the Jailor's office. While this change was being effected, Parsons became
</p>
<p>greatly agitated, and he remarked :
</p>
<p>" If I only had one of the bombs Lingg had in his cell, I would make
</p>
<p>very short work of all this."
</p>
<p>Fischer also made a similar remark. He said that he was ready to die
</p>
<p>at any time, and he did not care how he died. He was very defiant, and
</p>
<p>showed that he was in earnest in his expressions.

<p>638 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon of November 10, Gov. Oglesby gave his decision
</p>
<p>on the various applications for mercy. It reads :
</p>
<p>STATE OF ILLINOIS, EXECUTIVE OFFICE, SPRINGFIELD, Nov. 10.
</p>
<p>On the aoth day of August, 1886, in the Cook County Criminal Court, August Spies
</p>
<p>Albert R. Parsons, Samuel Fielden, Michael Schwab, Adolph Fischer, George Engel and
</p>
<p>Louis Lingg were found guilty by the verdict of the jury and afterward sentenced to be hanged
</p>
<p>for the murder of Mathias J. Began.
</p>
<p>An appeal was taken from such finding and sentence, to the Supreme Court of the State.
</p>
<p>That court, upon a final hearing and after mature deliberation, unanimously affirmed the
</p>
<p>judgment of the court below.
</p>
<p>The case now comes before me by petition of the defendants, for consideration as Governor
</p>
<p>of the State, if the letters of Albert R. Parsons, Adolph Fischer, George Engel and Louis
</p>
<p>Lingg demanding ' ' unconditional release," or, as they express it, "liberty or death," and pro-
</p>
<p>testing in the strongest language against mercy or commutation of the sentence pronounced
</p>
<p>against them, can be considered petitions.
</p>
<p>Pardon, could it be granted, which might imply any guih whatever upon the part of either
</p>
<p>of them, would not be such a vindication as they demand. Executive intervention upon the
</p>
<p>grounds insisted upon by the four above-named persons could in no proper sense be deemed
</p>
<p>an exercise of the constitutional power to grant reprieves, commutations and pardons, unless
</p>
<p>based upon the belief on my part of their entire innocence of the crime of which they stand
</p>
<p>convicted.
</p>
<p>A careful consideration of the evidence in the record of the trial of the parties, as well as
</p>
<p>of all alleged and claimed for them outside of the record, has failed to produce upon my mind
</p>
<p>any impression tending to impeach the verdict of the jury or the judgment of the trial court
</p>
<p>or of the Supreme Court, affirming the guilt of all these parties.
</p>
<p>Satisfied, therefore, as I am, of their guilt, I am precluded from considering the question
</p>
<p>of commutation of the sentences of Albert R. Parsons, Adolph Fischer, George Engel and
</p>
<p>Louis Lingg to imprisonment in the penitentiary, as they emphatically declare they will not
</p>
<p>accept such commutation. Samuel Fielden, Michael Schwab and August Spies unite in a
</p>
<p>petition for "executive clemency." Fielden and Schwab, in addition, present separate and
</p>
<p>supplementary petitions for the commutation of their sentences. While, as said above, I am
</p>
<p>satisfied of the guilt of all the parties, as found by the verdict of the jury, which was sustained
</p>
<p>by the judgments of the courts, a most careful consideration of the whole subject leads me to
</p>
<p>the conclusion that the sentence of the law as to Samuel Fielden and Michael Schwab may be

</p>
<p>modified as to each of them, in the interest of humanity, and without doing violence to public
</p>
<p>justice.
</p>
<p>As to the said Samuel Fielden and Michael Schwab, the sentence is commuted to imprison-
</p>
<p>ment in the penitentiary for life.
</p>
<p>As to all the other above-named defendants, I do not feel justified in interfering with the
</p>
<p>sentence of the court. While I would gladly have come to a different conclusion in regard to
</p>
<p>the sentence of defendants August Spies, Adolph Fischer, George Engel, Albert R. Parsons
</p>
<p>and Louis Lingg, I regret to say that under the solemn sense of the obligations of my
</p>
<p>office I have been unable to do so. RICHARD J. OGLESBY, Governor.
</p>
<p>This removed the last hope of the Anarchists. Spies said he had been
</p>
<p>prepared for the worst, and that he had only signed the petition of Fielden
</p>
<p>and Schwab for clemency at the solicitation of Miss Van Zandt.
</p>
<p>On the next morning after the Governor's decision Fielden and Schwab
</p>
<p>were removed to the penitentiary at Joliet.

</p>
<p>THE Anarchists of Chicago now became desperate. Many of them had
</p>
<p>calculated on the worst for some time, and they had formed into small
</p>
<p>groups to be better able to plot for their imprisoned friends with the least
</p>
<p>possible danger of police detection. While assembling in large bodies,
</p>
<p>they had discovered that many of their secrets were in my possession, and
</p>
<p>after the decision of the Illinois Supreme Court they realized that it was
</p>
<p>essential to the success of any movement they might decide upon to keep
</p>
<p>all knowledge of it within the circle of true and trusted men. The leading
</p>
<p>lights in the order accordingly resorted to private residences, as I have
</p>
<p>already stated.
</p>
<p>Sometimes they were joined in meetings of a general nature by some
</p>
<p>who had previously been anti-Anarchists, but who since the decision of the
</p>
<p>Illinois court had secretly expressed sympathy with the condemned men.
</p>
<p>Becoming emboldened by what they thought to be a growing sentiment in
</p>
<p>favor of the prisoners, these secret abettors finally threw off their masks,
</p>
<p>and, openly expressing their views, many of them speedily lost the esteem
</p>
<p>and friendship of neighbors by whom they had previously been highly re-
</p>
<p>garded. With a view to aiding to effect a general change in public senti-
</p>
<p>ment, some of these sympathizers even threw open their doors to Anarchists,
</p>
<p>as I have indicated in a prior chapter. But whenever some risky project
</p>
<p>was contemplated the small bands of conspirators saw to it that none but

</p>
<p>avowed and tried adherents of the red flag were present.
</p>
<p>It was at this time that the police -discovered the plot to release the
</p>
<p>doomed men, and one day Detective Schuettler learned of a place where
</p>
<p>numerous secret conferences were being held from time to time. He was
</p>
<p>under orders of Mr. Ebersold, who had taken him away from the Chicago
</p>
<p>Avenue Station with a view to crippling my force, but nevertheless the
</p>
<p>detective found a way, even while engaged in other directions, to keep a

<p>640 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>keen eye on secret revolutionary movements. He had been too long in the
</p>
<p>service to lose his interest in things Anarchistic, and he resolved to get at
</p>
<p>the bottom of the rumored clandestine gatherings.
</p>
<p>Learning that star-chamber sessions were being held in the room of an old-
</p>
<p>time Communist named Theodore Appell, at No. 234 West Division Street,
</p>
<p>Schuettler at once rented an adjoining room. In this appartment there was
</p>
<p>a closet, and after reconnoitering about the premises at a favorable oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity, he discovered that by cutting a hole in the closet wall he could
</p>
<p>obtain a good view of those who might be present at future meetings. A
</p>
<p>hole was accordingly cut. This gave him a fine chance both to see and
</p>
<p>hear. Everything worked nicely for a time, but finally the conspirators
</p>
<p>became suspicious, as they found their secrets getting beyond their own
</p>
<p>circle, and, satisfied that the leakage was not due to members in their own
</p>
<p>set, they instituted a search. The result was that the officer's peep-hole was
</p>
<p>discovered. That closed their deliberations in that place, but they resolved
</p>
<p>to take revenge on the man who had thus obtruded his attentions upon
</p>
<p>them. For this purpose they decided to hold a mock meeting in the
</p>
<p>old quarters, and then and there, when they were satisfied that the con-
</p>
<p>cealed individual had his eye at the hole, to discharge a syringe filled with
</p>
<p>vitriol. This would destroy the eye-sight as well as disfigure for life the
</p>
<p>face of the man who had dared to intrude on their secrecy. I learned of this
</p>
<p>plan, however, and warned the officer. Schuettler never again went near
</p>
<p>that closet. But he had already gathered all the information that was
</p>
<p>needed.
</p>
<p>The conspirators left the place like young birds leave the old nest, with
</p>
<p>a flop and a flourish, never to return ; but we had learned that they had in
</p>
<p>view the liberation of their friends in jail.
</p>
<p>This information put the authorities on their guard, and it is possible
</p>
<p>that this timely discovery averted a jail delivery.
</p>
<p>But the Anarchists did not lose hope. When they learned that the
</p>
<p>United States Supreme Court had refused to interfere with the execution
</p>
<p>they became more desperate than ever. Where before they had been
</p>
<p>revengeful, they now were frantic, and their schemes now embraced more
</p>
<p>drastic and destructive measures. .They considered propositions looking to

<p>a blowing-up of the jail building with dynamite, and in the turmoil and
</p>
<p>confusion incident to the wreckage of a part of the building and the
</p>
<p>destruction of life within they contemplated a rush to the untouched
</p>
<p>portion containing their comrades, whom they would thus rescue from the
</p>
<p>hands of the law. This diabolical plot was earnestly debated, and about
</p>
<p>the time the reds became satisfied that the Governor would not step in
</p>
<p>between their convicted leaders and the gallows they even went so far as
</p>
<p>to advocate an explosion that would not only rob the gallows of its victims,

<p>but kill those whom curiosity might assemble about the jail a short time

<p>before the expected event. If their comrades must die, they should not
</p>
<p>die alone. The disgrace of an execution must be averted, and a terrible
</p>
<p>lesson imparted to the enemies of Anarchy.
</p>
<p>But the jail officials joined m^ in most rigid measures to prevent the
</p>
<p>execution of each and all of the plots, and officers and detectives were
</p>
<p>stationed in goodly numbers about the building, night and day, to watch
</p>
<p>the movements of suspicious characters. When the decision of the
</p>
<p>Governor was finally announced
</p>
<p>this vigilance was redoubled, and
</p>
<p>we made sure that no secret
</p>
<p>mines had been constructed under
</p>
<p>any of the sidewalks surrounding
</p>
<p>the building or across under the
</p>
<p>alley on the west side of the jail
</p>
<p>structure.
</p>
<p>It was not only the liberation
</p>
<p>of the imprisoned Anarchists that
</p>
<p>was aimed at in the numerous
</p>
<p>conspiracies which came to our
</p>
<p>knowledge about this time. One
</p>
<p>plot which was reported to me
</p>
<p>embraced a wanton scheme of in-
</p>
<p>cendiarism and pillage, and in
</p>
<p>order to facilitate this, it was pro-
</p>
<p>posed to cut off the water
</p>
<p>supply of the city by demol-
</p>
<p>ishing the stand-pipe in the
</p>
<p>Water -works tower. In
</p>
<p>some manner the conspira- <n

<p>tors had learned the exact

<p>tive execution, and the re- From a Photograph.
</p>
<p>ports brought to me showed that this project was debated most minutely.
</p>
<p>For the space of two months we were required therefore to keep extra guard
</p>
<p>over the source of Chicago's water supply, and the contemplated attack of
</p>
<p>the reds was not attempted.
</p>
<p>While the plots on the outside of the jail were thus met with vigilance,
</p>
<p>the doomed conspirators within appeared quiet and resigned. They re-
</p>
<p>ceived the Governor's decision with extraordinary composure, and, having
</p>
<p>felt throughout that day that they must face the inevitable on the morrow,
</p>
<p>they busied themselves in arranging their earthly affairs, writing letters
</p>
<p>642 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>to friends and relatives and giving directions as to the disposition of per-
</p>
<p>sonal matters and the publication of their autobiographies and other manu-
</p>
<p>scripts. Early in the evening they received their immediate friends and
</p>
<p>relatives to bid them farewell, and through all that trying ordeal they
</p>
<p>remained unmoved. Tears coursed down the blanched faces of wives, sis-
</p>
<p>ters and daughters as the last loving words were spoken, but no emotion
</p>
<p>of despair or grief seemed to agitate the men. They were solemn and stoical
</p>
<p>in their demeanor, and their efforts were mainly directed to administering
</p>
<p>words of cheer and consolation. When the final parting had taken place,
</p>
<p>they returned to their cells, and their last night on earth was varied with
</p>
<p>letter- writing and chats with the death-watch. None of them retired early.
</p>
<p>Parsons did not seek his couch till after midnight, and then it was some
</p>
<p>time before the rapid thoughts coursing through his brain would permit
</p>
<p>him to sleep Before morning he broke the stillness of his surroundings by
</p>
<p>singing a favorite song of his earlier days "Annie Laurie." The clear
</p>
<p>tones echoing down the corridor startled all then awake, and prisoners and
</p>
<p>death-watch eagerly inclined their heads to catch every word and note.
</p>
<p>When Parsons drew near the closing stanza, his voice tripped and hesi-
</p>
<p>tated, unmistakably showing that his feelings were giving way to the recol-
</p>
<p>lections of former times.
</p>
<p>Spies lay down to rest at a late hour, but his thoughts, as he chatted with
</p>
<p>his death-watch, seemed busy with the events that had brought him to a
</p>
<p>murderer's doom. He denounced the verdict as iniquitous, and declared
</p>
<p>that the people would shortly see the error of hanging men for seeking the
</p>
<p>welfare of the laboring classes.
</p>
<p>Fischer was the quietest and most self-composed of all, and he had very
</p>
<p>little to say "even to his death-watch. He soon apparently fell into a slum-
</p>
<p>ber and seemed to rest easily.
</p>
<p>Engel was also remarkably self-possessed, and he was the last to retire
</p>
<p>to his couch not because of thoughts of the morrow occupying his mind,
</p>
<p>but for another reason, as will appear further along.
</p>
<p>During the latter part of the night, if any one of them had happened to
</p>
<p>be awake, the horrible preparations for the execution could have been
</p>
<p>distinctly heard. Around the corner, in the corridor north of the one in

<p>which their cells were located, the gallows were being placed in position,
</p>
<p>and, even though the sounds of the hammer were subdued, the echo plainly
</p>
<p>told the character of the work the carpenters were engaged upon. It was
</p>
<p>the same scaffold on which the three Italians had two years before atoned
</p>
<p>for the death of a murdered countryman, and on which the murderer
</p>
<p>Mulkowsky had also paid the penalty for his foul crime. It was a large
</p>
<p>structure large enough to have dropped seven men had the original
</p>
<p>sentence of the trial court been carried into full execution. At the end of

<p>each rope one hundred and eighty pound weights were attached, so as to

<p>to have had a restful night. Their demeanor had not changed perceptibly
</p>
<p>from that of other mornings. After their ablutions they perused the morn-
</p>
<p>ing papers and subsequently partook of breakfast, brought in from a neigh-
</p>
<p>boring restaurant. They ate quite heartily, and then each turned his atten-
</p>
<p>tion again to letter-writing. Their communications were mainly directed to
</p>
<p>their families and to friends in the city, and some to Anarchists in other
</p>
<p>parts of the country, and very nearly the last they penned were directed to
</p>
<p>the Sheriff and to the Coroner and had reference to the disposition of their
</p>
<p>bodies and personal effects after death.
</p>
<p>During the fleeting morning hours, the Anarchists were visited by the
</p>
<p>Rev. Mr. Bolton, of the First Methodist Episcopal Church of Chicago,
</p>
<p>who came to assist ni their spiritual preparation for death, but while each
</p>
<p>received him courteously, they all declined
</p>
<p>his kindly proffered ministrations. They
</p>
<p>had no faith in the gospel and frankly told
</p>
<p>the clergyman that they did not desire his
</p>
<p>services. They wanted to die as they had
</p>
<p>lived, with no faith in God or man as exalted
</p>
<p>above general humanity. Some of them
</p>
<p>even went into discussion with the clergy-
</p>
<p>man, stoutly combatting every point he made
</p>
<p>to reach their hearts ; but the talk always
</p>
<p>ended as it had begun in a positive refusal
</p>
<p>to accept any spiritual guidance or advice.
</p>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Bolton was forced to retire
</p>
<p>without having made any impression, and
</p>
<p>the men treated the whole matter afterwards
</p>
<p>in a most indifferent and flippant manner.
</p>
<p>While the unfortunates on the inside were apparently unmoved by their
</p>
<p>impending fate, commotion and excitement prevailed on the outside of the

<p>jail. At a very early hour in the morning a contingent of the police force,
</p>
<p>numbering three hundred men, was detailed to preserve order and keep away
</p>
<p>from the immediate vicinity of the building all persons not having proper
</p>
<p>credentials or not properly vouched for. Across Michigan and Illinois
</p>
<p>Streets, on the east side of Clark Street, and on Dearborn Avenue at its
</p>
<p>intersections with the two first-named streets, stout ropes were stretched,
</p>
<p>and within the inclosure thus formed and at the barriers squads of police-
</p>
<p>men were marching up and down with glistening bayonets and Winchester
</p>
<p>rifles. There were also policemen in and about the Criminal Court and
</p>
<p>jail building and on the roof, commanding the streets below in all direc-

</p>
<p>tions. There was thus a most complete arrangement to meet any unex-
</p>
<p>pected attack or any violent hostile demonstration.
</p>
<p>As the hour approached for the execution the streets beyond the ropes
</p>
<p>became crowded with people of all grades and descriptions, impelled by
</p>
<p>curiosity ; but they were all kept moving by policemen scattered along the
</p>
<p>thoroughfares amongst them, so that no groups might gather and under the
</p>
<p>excitement of the moment precipitate a row or a riot. Along toward ten
</p>
<p>o'clock Mrs. Parsons, dressed in mourning and accompanied by her two
</p>
<p>children, presented herself at the ropes and demanded admittance to see
</p>
<p>her husband "murdered by law." She was, of course, delicately refused,
</p>
<p>and then she endeavored to create a scene, but the police promptly called
</p>
<p>a patrol wagon and sent her to the Chicago Avenue Station, where she was
</p>
<p>detained until'after the execution. During the forenoon thousands of peo-
</p>
<p>ple passed in the vicinity of the building, but the only satisfaction they
</p>
<p>received for their pains was a sight of the somber walls of the jail at a dis-
</p>
<p>tance. Taking the crowd as a whole, it was remarkably orderly, although
</p>
<p>there was more or. less subdued muttering among the Anarchists who had
</p>
<p>sought the vicinity only to find themselves ordered to "move on." These
</p>
<p>generally sought solace for their wounded feelings in neighboring saloons,
</p>
<p>where they cast dire imprecations upon the police, promising to be avenged
</p>
<p>in time.
</p>
<p>Within the jail everything was quiet, and, except for the presence of
</p>
<p>those who had come to witness the execution, there seemed to be no special
</p>
<p>indication of the tragedy to be enacted. The officials moved about quietly
</p>
<p>while making the preliminary arrangements, and the unfortunate Anarchists
</p>
<p>smoked, wrote hasty notes and chatted at intervals with their attendants.
</p>
<p>At 11:30 o'clock Sheriff Matson, accompanied by Deputies Hartke,
</p>
<p>Cleveland, Spears and Peters, County Physician Moyer and Jailor Folz,
</p>
<p>started from the jail office, and repaired to the cell occupied by Spies. The
</p>
<p>iron-barred door was opened, and Spies advanced to meet the Sheriff.
</p>
<p>Mr. Matson at once proceeded to read the death warrant. Spies listened
</p>
<p>with folded arms, and there was no indication of nervousness nor trace of
</p>
<p>emotion. His feelings could not be divined from his demeanor. The facial
</p>
<p>muscles remained unmoved, and no color rose to flush the usual paleness

<p>of the cheeks, nor was the pallor of his face heightened when the last fear-
</p>
<p>ful words of the warrant had been read. The Sheriff was visibly agitated,
</p>
<p>and his voice was at times tremulous. On the conclusion of the .reading
</p>
<p>Spies merely bowed his head slightly, and then stepped out into the corridor
</p>
<p>in obedience to the deputies' request. Around his chest was placed a leather
</p>
<p>belt about an inch and a half wide, with which to pinion his arms just above
</p>
<p>the elbows, and his hands were handcuffed behind his back. Then a white mus-
</p>
<p>lin shroud was thrown over him and fastened slightly at the neck and waist.
</p>
<p>While these details were being carried out, the Sheriff was at Fischer's

<p>THE EXECUTION.
</p>
<p>646 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>cell, and the same programme of preparation was gone through with. The
</p>
<p>Anarchist was manacled, pinioned and shrouded, and he gazed upon each
</p>
<p>operation with curious interest, but with no sign of perturbation or weak-
</p>
<p>ness. Now and then he faintly smiled, and he seemed more concerned
</p>
<p>about the trepidation of the deputies than about his own situation.
</p>
<p>Meantime the death warrant had been read to Engel, who was soon
</p>
<p>arrayed in the habiliments of death. He stood it all unflinchingly, and
</p>
<p>seemed even less concerned than his comrades. There was also an entire
</p>
<p>absence of affected indifference.
</p>
<p>Parsons was the last to step out of his cell, and, as he stood receiving
</p>
<p>the ghastly paraphernalia, he endeavored to display no sign of fear. He
</p>
<p>bore up well, although he evidently wrestled with his inner feelings.
</p>
<p>The solemn march to the scaffold began with the Sheriff in the lead.
</p>
<p>In the east corner of the north corridor stood the scaffold. Below and
</p>
<p>before it were benches for the two hundred spectators. The death proces-
</p>
<p>sion moved slowly and with measured tread. As it neared the corner the
</p>
<p>footfalls became distinctly audible to those assembled. When the shuf-
</p>
<p>fling of feet on the iron stairway leading to the first gallery, which was on a
</p>
<p>level with the gallows, was heard, the buzz of conversation ceased, and
</p>
<p>every eye was centered on the spot whence the Anarchists would be first
</p>
<p>seen. It was only a moment, and then Spies, Fischer, Engel and Parsons,
</p>
<p>one after the other, came into view, each with a deputy by his side. Having
</p>
<p>reached their respective places on the trap, they faced the spectators.
</p>
<p>Spies, the moment he caught sight of the audience, gave it a contemptuous
</p>
<p>look, and thereafter his eyes seemed centered on some invisible object down
</p>
<p>the corridor above the heads of the spectators. Fischer merely looked
</p>
<p>down for a moment on the uncovered heads below, and then his eyes wan-
</p>
<p>dered in various directions. Engel seemed the most unconcerned of all,
</p>
<p>and swept the audience with a cool glance as though it might have been
</p>
<p>composed of friends. Parsons was superbly stiff, and his gaze, after a snap
</p>
<p>at those below, firmly set itself in the direction of the cell tiers.
</p>
<p>As soon as those on the platform had taken the positions assigned, the
</p>
<p>lower limbs of the four Anarchists were pinioned. This was done very
</p>
<p>quickly. The nooses dangling overhead were then lifted from their hooks,

</p>
<p>and Spies was the first to have the rope placed around his neck. The
</p>
<p>noose had been slipped a little too tight, and, noticing the uneasiness it gave
</p>
<p>him, the deputy instantly loosened it a trifle. Spies gave a faint smile in
</p>
<p>acknowledgment of the kindness and again seemed at ease. Not a tremor
</p>
<p>was visible during the adjustment of the rope. Another deputy next placed
</p>
<p>the rope around the neck of Fischer, who, to facilitate its proper adjustment,
</p>
<p>bent his tall form slightly and received it with head inclined until the knot
</p>
<p>rested in its proper place under the left ear. Engel received the noose as
</p>
<p>if it had been a decoration about to be placed upon his shoulders by friendly
</p>
<p>THE TRAGIC END. 647
</p>
<p>hands, and several times he turned his head around to exchange a word or
</p>
<p>two with the deputy, accompanying his whispered utterances with a smile.
</p>
<p>Parsons stood unmoved when his turn came, and appeared entirely in-
</p>
<p>different to the operation. Loose-fitting white caps were now produced,
</p>
<p>and, as these came in sight, Fischer and Engel turned their heads slightly
</p>
<p>to the left and spoke a second to their respective deputies. Spies first,
</p>
<p>Fischer next, then Engel, and Parsons last, was the order in which the caps
</p>
<p>were adjusted, and the heads had no sooner been enveloped, shutting out
</p>
<p>forever the light of day, than all knew that the fatal moment had arrived.
</p>
<p>During all the preliminary preparations not a relaxation of nerve or an
</p>
<p>expression of anguish or despair had been observed. Now the tension of
</p>
<p>silence was painful. But suddenly there broke from the lips of Spies an
</p>
<p>exclamation that startled the auditors as if by a shock.
</p>
<p>" You may strangle this voice," said he, in clear but subdued tones, "but
</p>
<p>my silence will be more terrible than speech."
</p>
<p>Spies had scarcely uttered his last words, when Fischer shouted :
</p>
<p>" This is the happiest moment of my life. Hoch die Anarchic /"
</p>
<p>Engel immediately caught up the sentiment, and in a strong voice, and
</p>
<p>with a pronounced German accent, cried :
</p>
<p>"Hurrah for Anarchy ! "
</p>
<p>Parsons then lifted his voice, and in firm, deliberate tones, exclaimed :
</p>
<p>"O men of America !"
</p>
<p>Then, lowering his voice to an appealing accent :
</p>
<p>" Mr. Sheriff, may I be permitted to say a few words ? "
</p>
<p>Raising his voice again, without waiting for an answer, and continuing in
</p>
<p>the same breath, he said :
</p>
<p>"O men of America, let the voice of the people be heard."
</p>
<p>The last word had barely escaped his lips, when the signal was given to
</p>
<p>the unknown and hidden man in the sentry-box back of the platform, the
</p>
<p>rope controlling the trap was cut, and four bodies shot downward into space.
</p>
<p>The intervals between the adjustment of the caps, the utterances and the
</p>
<p>drop were only a few moments, but they were moments that seemed like
</p>
<p>hours. The first instant after the drop, the bodies all seemed motionless,
</p>
<p>but immediately one after the other began violent contortions, the limbs con-

</p>
<p>tracted, the breasts swelled with spasms, and the arms shook convulsively.
</p>
<p>It was fully eight minutes before the last was limp and lifeless. The bodies,
</p>
<p>however, were left hanging for twenty-six minutes, and then they were
</p>
<p>deposited in plain coffins, ready to be turned over to their relatives. The
</p>
<p>jury selected by the Sheriff to pass upon the death, as required by law, next
</p>
<p>viewed the remains and then signed the usual legal certificates. Those
</p>
<p>composing the jury were Dr. Ferdinand Henrotin, Dr. Denslow Lewis,
</p>

</p>
<p>It was subsequently ascertained that the necks of none of the Anarchists
</p>
<p>had been broken, and that death had come in each case through strangula-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>Within an hour and a half the coffins were removed, the bodies of Spies,
</p>
<p>Parsons and Fischer being receipted for by a committee of the Central
</p>
<p>Labor Union, and those of Engel and Lingg by a friend of Mrs. Engel. The
</p>
<p>body of Lingg had reposed in the women's department of the jail. Shortly
</p>
<p>before his death, the bomb-maker had expressed the wish that his body be
</p>
<p>allowed to repose by the side of Engel's, and that it be given in charge of
</p>
<p>Engel's family, as he himself had no relatives in America.

</p>
<p>sons were taken to an undertaking estab-
</p>
<p>lishment at No. 596 Milwaukee Avenue,
</p>
<p>and those of Engel and Lingg to a similar
</p>
<p>place at No. 186 Milwaukee Avenue, and
</p>
<p>there costly and ornamental coffins were
</p>
<p>provided after the bodies had been first
</p>
<p>embalmed. Subsequently they were re-
</p>
<p>moved to the houses of their respective
</p>
<p>relatives, and arrangements were at once
</p>
<p>set on foot for a tremendous demonstra-
</p>
<p>tion at the funeral, the following Sunday.
</p>
<p>No sooner had each coffin been taken
</p>
<p>to the relatives than hundreds of Anarchists
</p>
<p>flocked in to view the remains. Others,

<p>ones. Mrs. Parsons was in paroxysms of grief and had to be almost forci-
</p>
<p>bly removed from beside the bier of' her husband. Her curses were loud

</p>
<p>against the police, and she strenuously refused all comfort. At the Spies
</p>
<p>residence there were copious tears, and no one was more deeply moved
</p>
<p>than Miss Van Zandt. The sorrow of Mrs. Engel and her daughter was
</p>
<p>more subdued, but nevertheless keen and poignant. It was the same at
</p>
<p>Fischer's home.
</p>
<p>Meantime the preparations for the funeral went on, and the committee
</p>
<p>having it in charge determined that it should be conducted with the utmost
</p>
<p>pomp, ceremony and display. They desired that on this occasion the red
</p>
<p>flag should again be unfurled and wave over the bodies of those whom they
</p>
<p>regarded as martyrs. The police learned of it, and when a committee
</p>
<p>THE FUNERAL PROCESSION. 649
</p>
<p>waited upon Mayor Roche to secure the necessary permission for the pro-
</p>
<p>cession, he set his face firmly against the red flag.
</p>
<p>"The American flag, "said he, "is good enough for us, and it is good
</p>
<p>enough for you. If that flag don't suit you, I am sorry. No red flag shall
</p>
<p>ever take its place while I am Mayor of Chicago."
</p>
<p>Sunday, November 13, came, and every Anarchistic organization in
</p>
<p>the city turned out to attend the funeral. The procession, which started at
</p>
<p>an early hour, first called at the Spies residence, No. 154 Bryson Street,
</p>
<p>for the coffin of the editor, and then moved on to Mrs. Parsons' resi-
</p>
<p>dence at No. 785 Milwaukee Avenue. After the coffin of Parsons had been
</p>
<p>placed in the hearse, Fischer's house was reached, and next that of Engel,
</p>
<p>and when all the hearses were in line, the entire funeral procession pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded down Milwaukee Avenue, thence to Lake Street, and thence along
</p>
<p>Fifth Avenue to the depot of the Wisconsin Central Railway. At each of
</p>
<p>the houses of the executed Anarchists the cortege had been joined by
</p>
<p>friends and by various societies of which the dead had been members, and
</p>
<p>with these accessions the procession, as it finally moved on to its destina-
</p>
<p>tion, numbered not less than six thousand. The hearses were loaded down
</p>
<p>with flowers, wreaths and other floral tributes, and each was followed by
</p>
<p>carriages containing the mourners. Close behind the Spies hearse was a
</p>
<p>carriage containing Mrs. and Miss Van Zandt, mother and daughter, and
</p>
<p>Mrs. Spies, the mother, and Miss Gretchen, the sister of the deceased. All
</p>
<p>along the line of march, the sidewalks were thronged, and there must have
</p>
<p>been over fifty thousand persons who viewed the procession as it passed.
</p>
<p>Hundreds had gathered at the residences before the procession started, and
</p>
<p>when they joined the throngs already on Milwaukee Avenue the streets
</p>
<p>became almost impassable. Policemen were stationed at the various street
</p>
<p>corners, and these gave the processionists ample room to move unimpeded.
</p>
<p>The procession did not lack music, several bands having been engaged,
</p>
<p>and the " Marseillaise" and " Annie Laurie" were the airs most frequently
</p>
<p>heard.
</p>
<p>The absence of the red banner on the street was commented on, but
</p>
<p>with a seeming defiance of the Mayor's orders two red flags decked the
</p>
<p>coffins of Engel and Lingg. What was still more significant was the fact

</p>
<p>that not a single flag of the Union was borne by the procession. It was
</p>
<p>only when the Anarchists reached Lake Street that the red, white and blue
</p>
<p>was unfurled to the breeze, and then it was done, not by an Anarchist, but
</p>
<p>by Howell Trogden, a veteran of the civil war. It was a small emblem in
</p>
<p>size, and of cheap material, but he held it high above his head and proudly
</p>
<p>carried- it before the cortege, clear down to the depot, greatly to the dis-
</p>
<p>comfiture and chagrin of the reds. When remonstrated with by some one
</p>
<p>who was in the crowd that had gathered about him and cheered him on the
</p>
<p>way, he defiantly exclaimed in plain, though perhaps not elegant, language :
</p>
<p>650 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>" What, furl the ensign of the nation I fought for ? Not much ! You
</p>
<p>bet your life, I'll carry this flag and I'll kill the first man who tries to wrest
</p>
<p>it from me. I'll shed my blood to keep it there."
</p>
<p>And the flag was kept there.
</p>
<p>Arriving at the depot, the various organizations boarded the trains in
</p>
<p>waiting, and shortly after one o'clock all were under way to Waldheim Ceme-
</p>
<p>tery, situated some nine miles west of Chicago. It was a gloomy, cold day,
</p>
<p>but nevertheless an immense concourse of people followed the remains to
</p>
<p>the vault in which they were temporarily deposited. Those who had im-
</p>
<p>mediate charge of the funeral arrangements were Frank A. Stauber, H.
</p>
<p>Linnemeyer, George Schilling, R. M. Burke, Julius Leon, Edwin Goettge,
</p>
<p>Charles F. Seib, Ernst Litzman, H. Ulharn, F. G. Bielefeld, William
</p>
<p>Urban, Dr. Ernst Schmidt and T. J. Morgan, all members of the Defense
</p>
<p>Committee and the Amnesty Association.
</p>
<p>After the coffins had been placed in the vault, Capt. W. P. Black took a
</p>
<p>position near the entrance and delivered the funeral oration. In concluding
</p>
<p>his address, he said, speaking of a day "when righteousness should reign" :
</p>
<p>"We look forward to that day. We hope for it. We wait for it, and
</p>
<p>with such a hope in our hearts can we not bring the judgment of charity to
</p>
<p>bear upon any mistakes of policy or action that may have been made by any
</p>
<p>of those who, acknowledging the sublime and glorious hope in their hearts,
</p>
<p>rushed forward to meet it ? We are not here this afternoon to weep. We
</p>
<p>are not here to mourn over our dead. We are here to pay by our presence
</p>
<p>and our words the tribute of our appreciation and the witness of our love.
</p>
<p>I loved these men. I knew them not until I came to know them in the time
</p>
<p>of their sore travail and anguish. As months went by and I found in the
</p>
<p>lives of those with whom I talked the witness of their love for the people,
</p>
<p>of their patience, gentleness and courage, my heart was taken captive in
</p>
<p>their cause. For this I have no apology. If any of you feel that the tears
</p>
<p>are coming listen to the last words spoken by one of these, our dead.
</p>
<p>" ' Go not to my grave with your mourning, with your lamentations and
</p>
<p>tears, with your forebodings and fears. When my lips are dumb, do not
</p>
<p>thus come. Bring no long train of carriages ; no hearse with waving

<p>plumes, with the gaunt glory of death illumed ; but with hands on my heart
</p>
<p>let me rest. Ye who are left on this desolate shore, there still to suffer
</p>
<p>alone, deeply do I pity you. For me no more are the hardships, the bit-
</p>
<p>terness, heartache and strife, the sadness and sorrow of life, but the glory
</p>
<p>of the divine, that is mine. Poor creatures, afraid of the darkness, who
</p>
<p>groan at the sight of the anguish in our silent night, go to my tomb. Peal
</p>
<p>no solemn bell I am well.'
</p>
<p>" It has been said that these men knew no religion. I repel the charge.
</p>
<p>I know but one religion the religion which seeks to manifest itself by its
</p>
<p>service of God or of the supreme good by its service of humanity in its
</p>
<p>anguish and its hours of despair. And one of these, our dead, while within

<p>the very gloom of approaching death, gave in these words : ' My religion

<p>is this : To live right. To do right is to live right, and the service of
</p>
<p>humanity is my worship of God.'
</p>
<p>" I remember that back in the centuries it was written in words that shall
</p>
<p>THE ORATION AT WALDHEIM. 651
</p>
<p>never perish : ' He that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as He is.
</p>
<p>righteous.-' There is no conception possible to humanity of that which we
</p>
<p>call God other than the conception which sets our life aflame ; n the service
</p>
<p>of our fellow-men. But I must not keep you. There is no necessity for mul-
</p>
<p>tiplying words in such a presence as this. There are times when silence is
</p>
<p>more terrible than speech ; when men moving to the supreme issue of life
</p>
<p>can say, standing with their feet on earth and their hands reaching out into
</p>
<p>the unknown, in a sublime burst of enthusiasm : ' This is the happiest
</p>
<p>moment of my life ' (the last words of Fischer), and then in that hour can
</p>
<p>cheer for the cause to which they have given their lives (as Engel did), and
</p>
<p>men in that hour, forgetting themselves, can speak of the voice of the peo-
</p>
<p>ple (Parsons' last words) until utterance is silenced forever, what need is
</p>
<p>there to stand by such men and multiply words ?
</p>
<p>" I say that a mistake may well be forgotten in the glory of the purpose
</p>
<p>which we condemn it may be through undue haste. I say that whatever
</p>
<p>of fault may have been in them, these, the people whom they loved and in
</p>
<p>whose cause they died, may well close the volume and seal up the record
</p>
<p>and give our lips to the praise of their heroic deeds and their sublime self-
</p>
<p>sacrifice."
</p>
<p>Some weeks afterwards arrangements were made for the final interment
</p>
<p>of the bodies. A suitable lot had been purchased with money collected by
</p>
<p>the "Defense Committee," and accordingly on Sunday, the i8th of Decem-
</p>
<p>ber, 1887, the Anarchists were invited out to Waldheim to witness the last
</p>
<p>rites over the dead conspirators. It was a cold, chilling day, and only
</p>
<p>about a thousand people were in attendance. The remains of the five
</p>
<p>Anarchists were removed from the vault, the coffins opened and the bodies
</p>
<p>viewed by all who desired. They were then placed in one grave, and a
</p>
<p>heavy flagstone was lowered and firmly cemented to protect them. The
</p>
<p>orators on this occasion were Mr. Buchanan, of Chicago, Paul Grottkau,
</p>
<p>of Milwaukee, and Albert Currlin, of St. Louis. The tenor of Grottkau's
</p>
<p>speech may be judged from the following extract:
</p>
<p>" Those cold clods of clay were the first offerings required at our hands,.
</p>
<p>but they will not be the last. Our lords believed that with them they could

<p>slaughter the idea and ideals they represent. They imagined that the five-
</p>
<p>fold gallows would forever choke liberty. How they have succeeded the
</p>
<p>future will show. Let them erect their gallows, put them up by the million,
</p>
<p>and they will never destroy the glorious principles. Not all their revolvers,
</p>
<p>their armories of bayonets and Catling guns, not all their bristling rows of
</p>
<p>cannon, can conquer us. (' Bravo ! ' ' Bravo ! ') From this land the fame
</p>
<p>of our martyrs and our principles will go out to the whole world. Our stran-
</p>
<p>gled ones are put at the head of the column. Their names will ever be the
</p>
<p>brightest on history's page. Party hate or sectional strife cannot dim their
</p>
<p>laurels. They were the champions of degraded and plundered humanity.
</p>
<p>They fought long and manfully for us ; they died to serve us ; and more
</p>
<p>than that man cannot do. It but remains for us to do our duty as they did
</p>
<p>theirs. We must be moved by their spirit. All mean personal desires must
</p>
<p>depart from us. We must continue our organization. We must be un-

<p>will free the wretched and enslaved proletarians and drive all injustice from
</p>
<p>the face of the earth. Brothers, they (pointing to the five coffins) have done
</p>
<p>their duty ; let us do ours."
</p>
<p>Currlin closed his address as follows :
</p>
<p>"We have been constantly bought, sold and delivered at the ballot-box'
</p>
<p>(Applause.) These heroes and true men had well considered the folly of
</p>
<p>relying on the ballot, and with firm hearts and resounding voices had pointed
</p>
<p>out the road to the thinking and the brave.
</p>
<p>" They are gone. Shall the sacrifice of these noble lives be fruitful or not ?
</p>
<p>It will, it must be. Let the dreadful act cement us together. Let us be
</p>
<p>loftier, firmer than ever. You have your Golgotha. See to it that you have
</p>
<p>your Easter, and have it soon. You owe it to yourselves and your families
</p>
<p>that you ever revere these dead. If at any time you become soul-weary or
</p>
<p>discouraged, make a pilgrimage to this hallowed spot and be reinvigorated
</p>
<p>for the strife. Let the prison, even the gallows, be powerless to overturn
</p>
<p>your purpose. Let us struggle for the right, for justice, freedom, and true
</p>
<p>fraternity until the nations of the earth are of us and with us, until the peo-
</p>
<p>ples are regenerated, and clean hands and clean hearts have authority to
</p>
<p>rule." (Applause.)
</p>
<p>With the final burial of the dead, it may perhaps be well to inquire
</p>
<p>whether one of them continued to believe in Anarchy when he saw that there
</p>
<p>was no escaping from his fate. That one about whose faith there is most
</p>
<p>doubt is Engel.
</p>
<p>It is frequently the case that men condemned to death, either on the gal-
</p>
<p>lows or otherwise, make a powerful effort to die bravely, and that, whatever
</p>
<p>may have been their true feelings, the truth dies with them. It is seldom
</p>
<p>that any one reveals from the bottom of his heart his true sentiments. In
</p>
<p>this case, Engel was a man known to have been sober and sincere, who
</p>
<p>believed that everything he said was true and right, and who expressed his
</p>
<p>opinions freely before all his people. He professed the same sentiments to
</p>
<p>the public up to the moment of his death, his last words being, " Hurrah for
</p>
<p>Anarchy ! " Yet he felt differently. It is a well-known fact that people sen-
</p>
<p>tenced to death adhere until the last second to the position that they are

</p>
<p>right in their opinions or doctrines, or they simulate innocence. Now, aS to
</p>
<p>Engel, it had been shown by the evidence that he had frequented many
</p>
<p>places at night, to attend Anarchist meetings, and at many of them he deliv-
</p>
<p>ered addresses. On some of these occasions he was accompanied by his
</p>
<p>only daughter, a bright young girl about fifteen or sixteen years of age, and
</p>
<p>she often heard him utter sentiments which she ought not to have heard.
</p>
<p>But the girl could not help it. She was there, and she had to listen. After
</p>
<p>these meetings they would walk home together, and the daughter's company
</p>
<p>was always a source of great pleasure to Engel. She was also greatly attached
</p>
<p>to her father, and, naturally, whatever she heard him say she regarded as
</p>
<p>true, having the fnost implicit faith in him. Engel knew all this, and many
</p>
<p>rstormy nights she would brave the weather to be at his side at meetings he
</p>
<p>EN GELS TRUE SENTIMENTS.
</p>
<p>653
</p>
<p>felt himself obliged to attend. She would cling to his arm, and through
</p>
<p>snow and storm they would face the elements. When Engel's last night on
</p>
<p>earth came, he asked the Sheriff and Jailor to permit his beloved daughter
</p>
<p>to remain with him during the night, and, the officials having satisfied them-
</p>
<p>selves that no sinister purpose was in view, the wish was granted. This was
</p>
<p>the night of November 10, and young Mary kept her father cheerful com-
</p>
<p>pany during the long hours. Engel seemed to have had something on his
</p>
<p>mind, but he refrained from saying anything until shortly before the time
</p>
<p>for her departure. It was evident that Engel had a deep solicitude for her
</p>
<p>welfare, in spite of his pretended stolidity. In theory he had always ex-
</p>
<p>pressed the greatest admiration for Louise Michel, and on every occasion
</p>
<p>he had lauded that Frenchwoman for her bravery in suffering imprisonment
</p>
<p>and readiness to sacrifice her life for Anarchy. But he regarded theor)' and
</p>
<p>practice as separate and distinct, and in the face of death his thoughts
</p>
<p>concerned them-
</p>
<p>selves with the
</p>
<p>future of his dear
</p>
<p>child. Should she
</p>
<p>espouse Anarchy
</p>
<p>and follow in his
</p>
<p>footsteps, taking
</p>
<p>up his work where
</p>
<p>he had left off?
</p>
<p>This is what agi-
</p>
<p>tated Engel, and
</p>
<p>he soon decided
</p>
<p>the issue. With
</p>
<p>a serious and earn-
</p>
<p>est manner, and in
</p>
<p>a very strong voice, he said in German :
</p>
<p>" Mein liebes Kind, kummere dich nicht um Anarchic. Du siehest wie
</p>
<p>esmir geht. Und vergesse diese Worte nicht so lange du lebst." (Trans-

<p>lated : " My dear child, do not trouble yourself about Anarchy. You see
</p>
<p>my situation. Do not forget these words as long as you live." )
</p>
<p>I am happy to record this to Engel's credit. He was conscious that he
</p>
<p>had been in the wrong for some time, and he had the manhood to warn his
</p>
<p>daughter not to embrace Anarchy. He wished her to maintain a good
</p>
<p>character and grow up to be a good woman.
</p>
<p>The words I have given are true to the letter, just as they were spoken
</p>
<p>by Engel to his daughter, at the time I have stated, and, no matter how
</p>
<p>strenuously Anarchists may deny this, it will still remain the truth. I will
</p>
<p>even add that I have no doubt that Engel's comrades entertained similar
</p>
<p>sentiments.

<p>KIERLAN'S SOUVENIR.
</p>
<p>654 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>The other doomed Anarchists, however, kept their own counsel, and no
</p>
<p>one seems to have been able to probe their real feelings. Spies and Par-
</p>
<p>sons were decidedly reserved, and Fischer had a severe demeanor, which
</p>
<p>only relaxed to intimate and trusted friends. A slight exception to his rule
</p>
<p>was made in his conduct toward his death-watch, John B. Kierlan. In
</p>
<p>speaking of Fischer, Kierlan, who was a deputy in the jail building, says :
</p>
<p>"At the beginning of February, 1887, I was detailed as death-watch to
</p>
<p>Fischer. When I first went on watch Fischer did not care much for my
</p>
<p>company, but after a week or so we got to be friends. He asked me to
</p>
<p>play cards with him, and I often joined him in a game. We played
</p>
<p>for imaginary and invisible beers. Sometimes I would lose, and then
</p>
<p>again he would be the loser. The one who lost generally wanted sat-
</p>
<p>isfaction, and the next night we would ' saw off ' the games, and in
</p>
<p>this way we were accustomed to spend our evenings together until
</p>
<p>the last few nights preceding November nth. Fischer was at this time in
</p>
<p>cell No. 28, second row. He became greatly attached to me, and was
</p>
<p>always pleased to see me. He had more confidence in me than in any other
</p>
<p>officer in the building, and I was with him nearly all the morning of Nov-
</p>
<p>ember nth. When it was nearly eleven o'clock that morning he said :
</p>
<p>'"Well, John, what about the beer you owe me? '
</p>
<p>"I was so greatly astonished that I could not answer him. Then
</p>
<p>Fischer threw his arm around my neck and said :
</p>
<p>"'Dear John, we must part.'
</p>
<p>"At the same time he kissed my cheek. This was a trying moment for
</p>
<p>me, as I had become greatly attached to him. While I knew him, he
</p>
<p>never used bad language or said anything unbecoming a gentleman. He
</p>
<p>asked me :
</p>
<p>' ' 'John, will you remember me ?'
</p>
<p>" ' I said : ' Yes, but I would like to have something to remember you by.'
</p>
<p>" He then pulled out a card from his pocket and wrote these words :
</p>
<p>" 'Liberty or death. Adolph Fischer, Cook County Jail, November n,
</p>
<p>1887.'
</p>
<p>"This card was given to me forty-five minutes before he died, and I am

<p>positive that these were the last words he wrote in his life."
</p>
<p>A fac-simile of the card appears on another page.
</p>
<p>The Freiheit of March i6th prints what it calls Lingg's literary testa-
</p>
<p>ment. It is stated in the introduction to the article that while in prison the
</p>
<p>bomb-maker carved a handsome little casket, which shortly before his death
</p>
<p>he presented to Johann Most as a souvenir. In a secret compartment of
</p>
<p>this casket was contained a small book, on the leaves of which Lingg had
</p>
<p>inscribed his sentiments, and from which the following is extracted :
</p>
<p>"What is Anarchy?
</p>
<p>"A man-worthy existence for the entire term of life, guaranteed to every

<p>UNHANGED MISCHIEF-MAKERS. 655
</p>
<p>one through complete individual liberty, all human needs being supplied by
</p>
<p>means of equal participation in the enjoyment of all the products of the
</p>
<p>community.
</p>
<p>" Free society (Anarchy) finds its limits only in those of the earth.
</p>
<p>"The object of Anarchy is to secure the greatest possible happiness to all.
</p>
<p>"This object is attained through the total extermination of all domina-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>" Domination is personified in exploiters (Ausbeuter) and tyrants.
</p>
<p>"The extermination of these, in view of their sources of power, can best
</p>
<p>be accomplished by means of dynamite.
</p>
<p>"After such extermination the workingmen will organize according to
</p>
<p>their inclinations, for protection and consumption.
</p>
<p>"Centralization /. e., subordination of the different groups of produc-
</p>
<p>tion and consumption under a clique composed of individuals, or even
</p>
<p>under a majority of society is not advisable, because in that way another
</p>
<p>domination would be established, and such would make illusory the stated
</p>
<p>purpose of free society Anarchy."
</p>
<p>In writing this book I have endeavored at all times to be fair and honest.
</p>
<p>While I have done everything in my power and made use of every faculty
</p>
<p>which God has given me to ferret out and to combat Anarchy, and while I
</p>
<p>believe now, as I always have believed, that the men who suffered death at
</p>
<p>the hand of justice in the Cook County Jail deserved their fate, I also be-
</p>
<p>lieve that there are those unhanged, and who probably never will be hanged,
</p>
<p>who are morally as guilty, and who deserve even a harsher fate than
</p>
<p>befell the men whose lives the law demanded. For these cowards selfish,
</p>
<p>sneaking conspirators as they are, who fight from ambush and take no
</p>
<p>risks would not deserve even the sympathy of the poor fools whom they
</p>
<p>lead to ruin. I firmly believe that Engel, Lingg and Fischer were at least
</p>
<p>sincere in their convictions and honest in their belief and in their expres-
</p>
<p>sions. Spies, I think, was led to his fate by vanity and a consuming desire
</p>
<p>for notoriety.
</p>
<p>In my investigations I of course looked carefully into the antecedents of
</p>
<p>all the Anarchists who were arrested by my command, and I will say right

</p>
<p>here that not a dishonest act, as regards the rights of property, was laid to
</p>
<p>the door of any one of them. Lingg, particularly, was scrupulously honest
</p>
<p>and conscientious in his dealings with his fellow-man. The day after the
</p>
<p>Haymarket massacre he found himself penniless, and for that reason refused
</p>
<p>at first to partake of the food offered him at Seliger's table.
</p>
<p>" I cannot partake of what belongs to you and your wife," he said, "nor
</p>
<p>of what I cannot pay for. You are as poor as I am."
</p>
<p>"You must share with us as long as we have food," replied Seliger ; but
</p>
<p>it was only after considerable urging that Lingg consented to appease his
</p>
<p>hunger.
</p>
<p>While apparent bravery in facing death on the gallows counts for noth-
</p>
<p>ing I have seen craven cowards meet their doom like stage heroes I
</p>
<p>believe that Lingg, Engel and Fischer would have died calmly and bravely
</p>
<p>656 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>even without the stimulants which are always administered to the condemned
</p>
<p>before the fatal moment, and which were, of course, administered to the
</p>
<p>four men before they were led to the fatal trap which hurled them into eter-
</p>
<p>nity. Lingg, particularly, during the entire term of his confinement, through
</p>
<p>the long months of the trial, and up to the very day when he so tragically
</p>
<p>took his own life, showed a consistency and a determination which would
</p>
<p>have been heroic had he not been the dupe of designing men who saw in
</p>
<p>the ardor of his temperament and in the resistless force of his enthusiastic
</p>
<p>energy the means to further and carry out iniquitous plots with which they
</p>
<p>had not the courage to openly identify themselves. I repeat again, there
</p>
<p>are those still unhanged, who are even now parading before a credible public
</p>
<p>as apostles of the cause of labor, and whose cowardice keeps them out of
</p>
<p>the reach of law, who deserve the greater share of public odium. Some of
</p>
<p>these, and others like them, are still at work in our midst, and in the midst
</p>
<p>of all communities in which the revolutionists see a chance of making prop-
</p>
<p>aganda out of differences between employers and employed. I hope that
</p>
<p>one result of my book may be to open the eyes of honest workingmen to the
</p>
<p>fact that those who preach violence and those who stir up trouble and

</p>
<p>THE question which will naturally present itself to the reader at this
</p>
<p>time is : What is the present condition of Anarchy in Chicago ? Has
</p>
<p>the frightful fate of the convicted conspirators proven a salutary lesson to
</p>
<p>the others, or is the propaganda still maintained ?
</p>
<p>Unfortunately these questions must be answered in a manner not calcu-
</p>
<p>lated to allay public apprehension.
</p>
<p>After the death and the burial of the executed leaders there was a period
</p>
<p>of quietness among the Anarchists. They seemed stunned by the blow
</p>
<p>which had been leveled at them, but the impression soon wore away, and in
</p>
<p>a short time they were as rampant as ever.
</p>
<p>Their first work was to provide for the families of the dead, and for this
</p>
<p>purpose a fund of $10,000 was speedily raised. Of this amount, strange to
</p>
<p>say, $4,000 has been invested in four per cent. Cook County bonds. This
</p>
<p>amount was intended as a reserve fund for the support of the families, and
</p>
<p>the rest of the money they are paying out in weekly installments to the
</p>
<p>families. On New Year's Day of 1888 each of the families was presented
</p>
<p>with $202 in cash, and loans have been made to Mrs. Parsons, Mrs. Fielden
</p>
<p>and Mrs. Engel to the amount of $400 in each case. These loans are de-
</p>
<p>ducted in small amounts from the weekly allowances to these women.
</p>
<p>Later in the year funds were found to send Mrs. Parsons on a lecturing
</p>
<p>tour to England, an adventure which did not prove a conspicuous success
</p>
<p>if the reports are to be believed, for the English discontents showed marked
</p>
<p>disapproval of Mrs. Parsons' dynamite appeals.
</p>
<p>Money is still being collected for a monument at Waldheim Cemetery

<p>which shall be the shrine of Anarchist pilgrimages from every part of the
</p>
<p>country. In this connection the revolutionists have established a " Festival
</p>
<p>of Sorrow," as they curiously call it, upon the anniversary of the execution.
</p>
<p>In the proceedings of commemoration held at the cemetery on November
</p>
<p>n, 1888, the most interesting episode was the reading of the following
</p>
<p>letter from Albert R. Parsons to his children, which had, by his instructions,
</p>
<p>remained sealed for a year. It ran as follows :
</p>
<p>657
</p>
<p>658 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>DUNGEON No. 7, COOK COUNTY JAIL, CHICAGO, ILL., November 9, 1887. To My
</p>
<p>Darling, Precious Little Children, Albert R. Parsons, Jr., and his Sister, Lulu Eda Parsons:
</p>
<p>As I write this word I blot your names with a tear. We never meet again. Oh, my chil-
</p>
<p>dren, how deeply, dearly your papa loves you. We show our love by living for our loved
</p>
<p>ones ; we also p rove our love by dying, when necessary, for them. Of my life and the cause
</p>
<p>of my unnatural and cruel death you will learn from others. Your father is a self-offered
</p>
<p>sacrifice upon the altar of liberty and happiness. To you I leave the legacy of an honest name
</p>
<p>and duty done. Preserve it, emulate it. Be true to yourselves, you cannot then be false to
</p>
<p>others. Be industrious, sober and cheerful. Your mother! Ah, she is the grandest, noblest
</p>
<p>of women. Love, honor and obey her. My children, my precious ones, I request you to.
</p>
<p>read this parting message on each recurring anniversary of my death in remembrance of him
</p>
<p>who dies not alone for you, but for the children yet unborn. Bless you, my darlings. Fare-
</p>
<p>well. Your father, ALBERT R. PARSONS.
</p>
<p>It was a somewhat disappointing epistle, for all the Anarchists had ex-
</p>
<p>pected a sensational document, as the result of such a theatrical instruction.
</p>
<p>On the other hand the people of Chicago have not been idle. A monu-
</p>
<p>ment to the memory of the murdered policemen will soon grace Haymarket
</p>
<p>Square as a lasting memorial to the brave men who fell in the line of duty,
</p>
<p>and as showing the gratitude of the city to its defenders.
</p>
<p>The pedestal for the police monument was completed long before the
</p>
<p>figure was ready to be placed. The foundation was begun and finished in
</p>
<p>December, 1888. The cost of the pedestal, with railings, light supports,
</p>
<p>and everything complete, in readiness for the figure, aggregated $5,000.
</p>
<p>The contract price for the pedestal was $3,500. This was increased to
</p>
<p>$4,000 by minor changes and extra work. The railings, electric lights and
</p>
<p>supports, and placing the figure in position, will add another $1,000. The
</p>
<p>figure itself will make the value of the monument $10,000.
</p>
<p>The pedestal sits on a circular sub-base of dressed granite, sixteen feet
</p>
<p>nine inches in diameter, elevated two steps above the foundation. A base
</p>
<p>of dressed granite with Ionic cornices rests on the center of this circular
</p>
<p>sub-base. The central cube, decorated with a shield on which is the coat of
</p>
<p>arms of the city, supports a block bearing an inscription giving the date of
</p>
<p>the riot and appropriate sentiments. Worked around these inscriptions

<p>are branches and leaves of oak, indicative of strength. By a graceful series
</p>
<p>of Ionic cornices the pedestal ascends to the base of the figure, the height
</p>
<p>from the foundation being seven feet six inches. The pedestal is oblong,,
</p>
<p>extending north and south across the circular base. Two arms of granite
</p>
<p>extending from the base unite on either side the granite base of the posts
</p>
<p>which support the lights.
</p>
<p>The designer of the figure which surmounts the pedestal, and which
</p>
<p>represents a police officer in full uniform with his arm extended, is Charles

<p>F. Batchelder.

<p>All of these are facts directly connected with and growing out of the trial

<p>THE HAYMARKET MONUMENT.

<p>660 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>acy conveyed to the cause of law and order, and consequently the malcon-
</p>
<p>tents have been watched with unceasing vigilance. Their meetings, their
</p>
<p>plottings, their purposes, their plan of organization and their system of
</p>
<p>propaganda we know nearly as well as they know it themselves.
</p>
<p>The Socialists themselves estimate their numbers in Chicago at 75,000
</p>
<p>men, women and children. As Socialism is the parent of Anarchy the
</p>
<p>two are identical in their ultimate aims, differing only in tactics these
</p>
<p>figures are significant.
</p>
<p>The number of Anarchists in Chicago to-day is not far from 7,300
</p>
<p>men and women. Of these there are thirty-five known to us to be des-
</p>
<p>perate men, ready to commit murder, arson or any other crime to revenge
</p>
<p>themselves upon the officers and the magistrates who were concerned in
</p>
<p>bringing about the hanging of their leaders. These are the most danger-
</p>
<p>ous conspirators in the body, and it may easily be believed that rather close
</p>
<p>attention is paid to their movements. Next to these comes a collection of
</p>
<p>some 275 men who are at heart dynamiters, and who would be ready to
</p>
<p>plunge into a revolt at any moment if they were not held back by the more
</p>
<p>prudent counsels of the others. These men are dangerous. Next to these
</p>
<p>there is a body of about 5,000 Anarchists, who would join in a revolt if they
</p>
<p>could persuade themselves or be persuaded that there was any real chance
</p>
<p>for success ; but they are as a rule careful of themselves, and they are not
</p>
<p>going to rush to the gallows if they can help it. Only in a time of great
</p>
<p>public tumult are they to be really feared. I place in still another category
</p>
<p>a body of 2,000 "sympathizers" men upon whom neither the Anarchists
</p>
<p>nor society could rely. They are a doubtful class, and might easily be led
</p>
<p>one way or the other by a decided victory on either side in a time of real
</p>
<p>struggle.
</p>
<p>Many women are to be found in each of these classifications, from the
</p>
<p>most desperate up. There are about forty " women-workers " so called
</p>
<p>who are engaged in the Anarchic propaganda in the city, six of them
</p>
<p>being lecturers. They are doing a great deal of harm.
</p>
<p>The present plans of the reds, as broadly stated by one of the open
</p>
<p>leaders, contemplate the use of every force in society "the force of educa-

<p>tion, the force of agitation and the force of arms ; the first now and always ;
</p>
<p>the second, with great care and judgment ; the last, when the time shall
</p>
<p>arrive for a strike at liberty." The reds throughout the world have learned
</p>
<p>a lesson from the failure of Spies and his companions, and while their aims
</p>
<p>and sentiments are unchanged, their plans have undergone considerable
</p>
<p>modification.
</p>
<p>A new system of organization has also been developed. They met at
</p>
<p>first in little groups of five or ten, fearing to gather in larger numbers in the
</p>
<p>excited times following the hanging. It was proposed to organize ward
</p>
<p>clubs, but this was negatived because the politicians would mix up with
</p>
<p>PRESENT ORGANIZATION. 66 1
</p>
<p>them to get their votes, and thus destroy the secrecy that they wanted.
</p>
<p>Their demand was for some sort of an organization enabling many people
</p>
<p>to meet together without attracting suspicion or inviting investigation
</p>
<p>by the police, and this they succeeded in doing by getting up a Building
</p>
<p>Society. This was followed by another and another in different parts of the
</p>
<p>town. They charge an initiation of ten cents, none but approved and
</p>
<p>guaranteed Anarchists are admitted, and the societies are working in full
</p>
<p>force, although I doubt whether they will greatly contribute to the material
</p>
<p>improvement of Chicago. The Anarchists are a very quarrelsome lot, and
</p>
<p>they often get into serious disputes with each other, and thus one party, to
</p>
<p>get revenge, would often come to me with information on his enemy. This
</p>
<p>has been stopped by the "Building Association," which maintains com-
</p>
<p>mittees to settle all quarrels between members.
</p>
<p>Aside from a majority of the thirty-two organizations affiliated with the
</p>
<p>Central Labor Union, the reds of late have been propagating the revolu-
</p>
<p>tionary cause through the following societies :
</p>
<p>1. The Workingmen's Defense Association, composed chiefly of men,
</p>
<p>of which Fred Bentthin is secretary. This same organization raised the
</p>
<p>money to defend the reds who were tried for the conspiracy to assassinate
</p>
<p>Judges Gary and Grinnell, Bonfield and others.
</p>
<p>2. The Pioneer Aid and Relief Society, composed chiefly of women.
</p>
<p>This institution came into existence immediately after the arrest of the
</p>
<p>Anarchists in May, 1886.
</p>
<p>3. A. R. Parsons Assembly No. i. This is a reorganization of the
</p>
<p>suspended or expelled Assembly 1307, once known as the Sons of Liberty.
</p>
<p>It has always been a hotbed of Anarchy, and is now composed of An-
</p>
<p>archists almost exclusively. Its membership is composed of such revolu-
</p>
<p>tionary lights as Oliver, Holmes, Snyder, Brown, Glasgow, and other
</p>
<p>fire-brands. Snyder and Brown were arrested at the time of the Haymarket
</p>
<p>massacre and held in custody for months.
</p>
<p>4. The English branch of the Socialistic Labor party, Waverly Hall,
</p>
<p>122 Randolph Street.
</p>
<p>5. The German branch of the Socialistic Labor party, 54 West Lake

<p>Street.
</p>
<p>6. The Socialistic Publishing Society, which controls the Arbeiter-
</p>
<p>Zeitung on the communistic plan and devotes all surplus to the cause of the
</p>
<p>social revolution.
</p>
<p>7. The " Arbeiter-Bund," or Working People's Confederation, recently
</p>
<p>organized at 636 Milwaukee Avenue. This is the most violent public organ-
</p>
<p>ization of Anarchists in Chicago.
</p>
<p>It was the Arbeiter-Bund which, through its attorneys, applied to Judge
</p>
<p>Tuley only a short time ago for an injunction to restrain the police from
</p>
<p>interfering with meetings of Socialists and Anarchists. While the in-
</p>
<p>662 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>junction was not technically granted, still the decision was such as to render
</p>
<p>the police powerless to interfere with their gatherings. The Chancellor's
</p>
<p>opinion is too lengthy to print here, but it was made on a broad construc-
</p>
<p>tion of the constitutional provision guaranteeing free speech. I am not a
</p>
<p>lawyer, and I will not attempt to say that the learned Chancellor misunder-
</p>
<p>stands the law or the Constitution, but it does seem that there ought to be
</p>
<p>some provision which should make it unsafe or impossible for bloody-minded
</p>
<p>revolutionists to preach their foreign doctrine in open defiance of a respect-
</p>
<p>able and law-abiding community.
</p>
<p>The impudence shown by the Anarchists, extreme Socialists and other
</p>
<p>enemies of society in claiming redress under the law would seem ridiculous
</p>
<p>if it were not contemptible. These agitators shout " throttle the law," and
</p>
<p>then complain that their meetings are suppressed contrary to law. At their
</p>
<p>meetings, in their speeches, and in other ways they cover the courts and
</p>
<p>judges with opprobrium, and then apply to the courts for restraining orders
</p>
<p>forbidding the police to interfere with their meetings. With yells and
</p>
<p>screeches in foreign tongues they declare that the Constitution shall be
</p>
<p>destroyed, and then complain that they are denied freedom of speech in
</p>
<p>violation of the Constitution. Putting themselves outside the law and de-
</p>
<p>manding its destruction, they at the same time demand its protection.
</p>
<p>Other forms of public organization are the " Schulgemeinde " of the
</p>
<p>Northwest Side, and the " Arbeiter Bildungs-Verein." The two last-named
</p>
<p>seem to have for their special object the establishment and maintenance
</p>
<p>of "Sunday schools."
</p>
<p>Of all this more will be said hereafter, but first I will call attention to
</p>
<p>the fact that the organizations named are only what appear on the surface.
</p>
<p>Underlying and controlling all these is the secret organization, which in
</p>
<p>Chicago consists of an "invisible committee." It must be understood
</p>
<p>that the movement toward the object to which the Internationale looks
</p>
<p>forward the social revolution is local, national, and international, and
</p>
<p>it is probable that the committee for Chicago was appointed from the
</p>
<p>headquarters of the Internationale in New York, at the suggestion of that
</p>
<p>arch-conspirator and migchief-maker, Johann Most. The " invisible com-

</p>
<p>mittee," although they have full direction of the movement in Chicago,
</p>
<p>are supposed to be unknown to the mass of the order. They work indi-
</p>
<p>vidually, and not as a body, and always quietly. Their identity they hold
</p>
<p>sacredly secret. It is only when open revolutionary work has actually
</p>
<p>begun that they are to come to the front. In the meantime, the open
</p>
<p>workers and agitators report to the individual "invisibles," and act under
</p>
<p>their advice. The " invisibles " themselves make it a point to practice
</p>
<p>moderation in their public utterances to divert suspicion. The old-time
</p>
<p>centralized organization, the reds believe, led to the detection and con-
</p>
<p>viction of their leaders, after the failure of the Haymarket plot, and this
</p>
<p>THE SE CRE T A GITA TORS. 663
</p>
<p>it was that made the new plan not only advisable but necessary. Decen-
</p>
<p>tralization is now the ruling principle.
</p>
<p>The public agitators are such people as Currlin, Holmes, Morgan,
</p>
<p>Mikolanda, Grottkau, Mostler, Bergman, G. Smith, Poch, Mittag, Ment-
</p>
<p>zer and others. They declare themselves openly as Anarchists and agi-
</p>
<p>tators. They are of course well known to the police, and consequently
</p>
<p>they are on the lookout not to come in contact with us. They only enlist
</p>
<p>recruits, however. The secret agitators visit public meetings occasionally,
</p>
<p>but they very seldom do any talking. Nobody notices them, and this is
</p>
<p>what they want. They are seldom members of any " Verein," and they
</p>
<p>form acquaintances on the street, in shops or saloons, but always with
</p>
<p>the utmost caution until they have gained confidence. They meet at
</p>
<p>private houses in parties of three or four, agitating wherever they can
</p>
<p>gain a point. When charged with being Anarchists they .deny it, and
</p>
<p>to throw off suspicion some of them even go regularly to church. Among
</p>
<p>these there are fanatics who would do almost anything to gain their ends.
</p>
<p>I know a great many of this class, and I would not believe it if I did not
</p>
<p>know of my own knowledge that they are Anarchists of the purest water.
</p>
<p>They are the most harmless-looking men in Chicago.
</p>
<p>The open and public movement still goes on under cover of the cause
</p>
<p>of labor. The plan of campaign is, so far as the public associations and
</p>
<p>meetings are concerned, to teach Anarchy ; to create in the minds of Social-
</p>
<p>istic adherents a hatred of all law and of all religion, and to inspire a spirit
</p>
<p>of revenge for the execution of Spies and his comrades. Their teachings
</p>
<p>are carried out by speeches more or less incendiary.
</p>
<p>The most potent factor for evil in Chicago to-day, as heretofore, is the
</p>
<p>Arbeit er-Zeitung. When this paper was first established it was delivered
</p>
<p>secretly through alleyways and at back doors. Now it has a circulation
</p>
<p>of 7,000 copies daily. Time was when the daily tirades of abuse scattered
</p>
<p>broadcast by that sheet were viewed with indifference by the English-
</p>
<p>speaking press of this city. That was in the seed-time of "theoretic"
</p>
<p>and " practical " Anarchy in Chicago. Then the dire meaning of it all
</p>
<p>escaped the bulk of the population. It was said and the saying was

<p>flaunted in the faces of the sullen hordes until it acted like the red
</p>
<p>rag on an infuriated bull that all this talk would end where it be-
</p>
<p>gan in talk. The paper is more readable and interesting now than it
</p>
<p>ever was. Its present editorial staff is an abler one, and understands bet-
</p>
<p>ter on occasion how to convey its meaning without expressing it in so
</p>
<p>many plain words. It comprises not only some of the old-time writers
</p>
<p>men like Paul Grottkau and Albert Currlin but it has now at its head a
</p>
<p>man of infinitely more cunning and ability than ever distinguished Au-
</p>
<p>gust Spies.
</p>
<p>Editor Jens Christensen, a native of the formerly Danish province of
</p>
<p>664 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>Schleswig, is a good-looking young German, and bears quite a resem-
</p>
<p>blance to his predecessor in personal appearance. He is thoroughly pro-
</p>
<p>ficient not only in German, but also in English, French, and all the Scan-
</p>
<p>dinavian tongues, is a scientifically trained man, and has at command an
</p>
<p>arsenal of facts, arguments and deductions to be marshaled up in defense
</p>
<p>of his specious pleadings.
</p>
<p>Christensen was at one time a Socialist candidate for the German
</p>
<p>Reichstag, and is now in constant and confidential correspondence with
</p>
<p>the leading European prophets of destruction. Although he has been
</p>
<p>in America less than a year, he has inspired in his disciples within that
</p>
<p>short time a degree of confidence which Spies never possessed. He has
</p>
<p>not the easy address of Spies in dealing with a crowd, and he is at all
</p>
<p>times a better, more logical and more forcible writer than orator ; but he is,
</p>
<p>for all that, the best public speaker the destructionists of this city have
</p>
<p>within their ranks to-day. He is more suave than impassioned in his
</p>
<p>speech reserved and self-possessed, and never at a loss for a reply.
</p>
<p>He is a zealot and a fanatic in the cause he has espoused, and he is prob-
</p>
<p>ably the only Socialist in Chicago who can give a scientific basis for every
</p>
<p>dogma he announces, and a proof for every word he utters.
</p>
<p>Since Christensen's arrival here he has been in a newspaper warfare
</p>
<p>with Johann Most. He attacked Most, charging him with being an injury
</p>
<p>to the cause of the revolution by his bad judgment and radical plans of
</p>
<p>dynamite and other methods for the application of physical force. Most
</p>
<p>has been striking back in his characteristic way, and this has brought
</p>
<p>Christensen into considerable prominence. Moreover, he is a writer with
</p>
<p>great executive ability. He is a man of strong convictions, evident
</p>
<p>courage, but is quite a diplomat, and does not propose to follow his
</p>
<p>"comrades" to the gallows by any slip of the pen or tongue if he can
</p>
<p>help it. Christensen is a Socialist, not an Anarchist, he says, and yet
</p>
<p>he declares with a good deal of frankness that Socialists and Anarchists
</p>
<p>are pretty much the same, so far as the result sought is concerned, the
</p>
<p>only essential differences being in the tactics used to reach the object
</p>
<p>aimed at.

<p>Such a man, it will be readily seen, when once started in the wrong
</p>
<p>path, is a much more dangerous foe than the hot-headed, rather selfish,
</p>
<p>openly ambitious Spies. And he shows his power in nothing better than in
</p>
<p>his manner of conducting the avowed organ of all the destructionists. Since
</p>
<p>his advent, this afternoon sheet has set the ferment of social agitation going
</p>
<p>again until the movement, as a matter of fact, is to-day in reality more for-
</p>
<p>midable than it was three years ago, for now it is directed by a cautious,
</p>
<p>self-contained man who weighs every step before advising it, and who in all
</p>
<p>things considers the question of expediency first.
</p>
<p>The paper he presides over is a daily proof of his skill and of his capa-

<p>city for doing harm. !< spreads the old doctrine of destruction and social
</p>
<p>upheaval, but it does so in a much more insidious, in a more guarded, and,
</p>
<p>probably, in a more effective manner. There is a general policy laid down,
</p>
<p>and that is never deviated from. Every line that goes into the reading
</p>
<p>columns of the Arbeiter-Zeitung has to serve a purpose. That purpose is ta
</p>
<p>teach a lesson, to serve as one more grain of disgust with the existing state
</p>
<p>of things, to render the reader more weary of the society of to-day. Every
</p>
<p>piece of news is bent to that end distorted, falsified, or magnified so as
</p>
<p>to "point a moral or adorn a tale." If a laborer has been cheated out of
</p>
<p>his wages, for instance, by his employer, a general deduction as to all em-
</p>
<p>ployers is made. If a wealthy thief escape more or less merited punish-
</p>
<p>ment, the sharp edge of sarcasm and of lament over the futility of trying to
</p>
<p>regenerate this world by any but "radical" means is again used. Every
</p>
<p>piece of rascality, in fact, /on the part of well-to-do or highly placed men,
</p>
<p>every misstep, every error, every unwise law and every unwise application
</p>
<p>of a wise one all of these things and many more are seized and made to
</p>
<p>serve the purpose of this personally smooth and amiable Mephistopheles,
</p>
<p>and are dished up to his benighted readers, peppered, salted and seasoned
</p>
<p>with Chile sauce, to make them palatable.
</p>
<p>Thus the paper acts on that vast body of half or wholly discontented, on
</p>
<p>all those who, with or without their own fault, are not as well off as they might
</p>
<p>be, on all those thousands who sympathized or still sympathize with the
</p>
<p>dread fate of the eight Anarchists arrested after the Haymarket slaughter,
</p>
<p>as a constant irritant, distorting everything to their mental eye and keeping
</p>
<p>them forever in an irritable mood and in a sort of self-made purgatory which
</p>
<p>embitters even their hours of rest and recreation. That this sort of effect
</p>
<p>cannot go accumulating in the minds of many thousands of men and women
</p>
<p>and children without finally producing something tangible, an explosion, is-
</p>
<p>self-evident and needs no emphasizing. Did space permit, I should like ta
</p>
<p>give here extracts to show how insidious and subtle the poison which is
</p>
<p>daily instilled into the minds of these readers.

<p>olutionary ideas. His style of oratory and the general drift of his senti-
</p>
<p>ments may be gathered from quotations heretofore given in this book.
</p>
<p>George Schilling would strenuously object to being called an Anarchist.
</p>
<p>But he admits being a Socialist. When asked a short time ago if he
</p>
<p>expected another outbreak as the result of existing revolutionary forces, he
</p>
<p>said :
</p>
<p>" I expect something of the kind about the end of the present century
</p>
<p>say in ten years. Society is just now dormant, like a river frozen in winter
</p>
<p>time, but some night there will be a mighty crack in the ice, and under the
</p>
<p>warming influences of evolutionary forces there will be a mighty upheaval.
</p>
<p>'666 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>There will no doubt be a squall or two before that time, but the great event
</p>
<p>will not come, in my judgment, much sooner. There will be lots of men
</p>
<p>and women who will not be able to see beyond the squall, and they will
</p>
<p>think the time has arrived. It will come, not as the result of a conspiracy
</p>
<p>of Anarchists, but as a conspiracy of all the evolutionary forces of society."
</p>
<p>Mrs. Lucy Parsons is still an active exhorter in the cause. She is sim-
</p>
<p>ply irrepressible, and has made herself obnoxious to the more peaceable and
</p>
<p>conservative Socialists. To the ordinary hearer her harangues would seem

<p>ridiculous, were it not for the fact that the loss of a husband by death on
</p>
<p>the gallows naturally creates sympathy, even for a fanatic.
</p>
<p>"Prison bars nor the scaffold shall ever prevent me from speaking the
</p>
<p>truth," she exclaimed at a Sunday afternoon meeting of Socialists at
</p>
<p>Waverly Hall a few months ago. " The ballot is useless as a remedy, and
</p>
<p>a change in the present condition of the wage slave will never be brought
</p>
<p>about peacefully. Force is the only remedy, and force will certainly be
</p>
<p>used."
</p>
<p>This meeting had been called to listen to a paper by Prof. Charles
</p>
<p>Orchardson on "Salvation from Poverty." The speaker, deprecating the
</p>
<p>incendiary arguments and appeals to forceful measures on the part of what
</p>
<p>were known as Anarchists, said that Anarchy never would improve the con-
</p>
<p>dition of society. He devoted himself principally to the private ownership
</p>
<p>of land, and claimed that more frauds had been committed in that name
</p>
<p>than in any other. Fire and murder were the sole right and title of the
</p>
<p>original owners of the land, and no original robbery could be tortured into
</p>
<p>a righteous transaction. The owner of the land was the owner of the in-
</p>
<p>habitants. Land in Chicago originally worth $i an acre was now, in some
</p>
<p>localities, worth perhaps $1,000,000 an acre. The people made this value,
</p>
<p>but the land-owner reaped the benefit of the advance the people had cre-
</p>
<p>ated. A land speculator was nothing but a land peculator, and held the
</p>
<p>people at his mercy. The three evils of society to-day, the speaker said,
</p>
<p>were private enterprise, the competitive system and private ownership of
</p>
<p>land. The first remedy to be applied was the education of the people.
</p>
<p>Another remedy was to adopt the single-tax theories of Henry George and

<p>to establish the Australian method of secret voting, so that the employ^
</p>
<p>could fearlessly deposit his ballot without fear of discharge from his em-
</p>
<p>ployer. This method would also abolish the buying and selling of votes.
</p>
<p>Then men should be elected to represent the people in the halls of legisla-
</p>
<p>tion and to resist the encroachments of the capitalists and monopolists.
</p>
<p>Private ownership in land should be abolished, and the capitalists should
</p>
<p>be compelled to stop the work of increasing poverty by curtailing the pro-
</p>
<p>ductions of the labor of man.
</p>
<p>During the discussion which followed the reading of Prof. Orchardson's
</p>
<p>paper, the ringing voice of Mrs. Parsons was heard in the rear of the hall.
</p>
<p>MRS. PARSONS 1 ORATORY. 667
</p>
<p>She had entered late, and few were aware of her presence, but she was
</p>
<p>greeted with loud applause as she rapidly and defiantly made her way
</p>
<p>to the front of the platform. She said :
</p>
<p>"'I did not hear the beginning of this lecture to-day, but I heard
</p>
<p>it last evening at 599 Milwaukee Avenue. I have heard what he had to
</p>
<p>say about the Anarchists, and I want to say to him and to everybody else
</p>
<p>that it is about time to give the Anarchists a rest. Are there not enough
</p>
<p>of them dead ? Do you need to go into their graves and aid the detec-
</p>
<p>tives in their work of digging up their memories for abuse and obloquy ?
</p>
<p>Last night the Professor was asked what remedy he would propose if the
</p>
<p>men elected to the legislature betrayed their trust and sold out their
</p>
<p>poor constituents, and he then said his remedy would be to organize secret
</p>
<p>societies and assassinate the men who proved unfaithful to their trusts.
</p>
<p>He need not deny this, for I have witnesses here to prove that he said
</p>
<p>this. And now to-day he throws his slings at Anarchy. Anarchy, as I
</p>
<p>understand it, is one of the most beautiful theories, and I do not agree
</p>
<p>with the speaker when he favors assassination. I hold human life too
</p>
<p>sacred, and do not believe in assassinating the men who sell out. Before
</p>
<p>they talk about Anarchy let them define it. It is a philosophy which
</p>
<p>they do not, or will not, understand. . . - ,
</p>
<p>" Men talk about revolution as if it were a terrible thing. Every one
</p>
<p>present is a revolutionist because he is poor. Every man who lives in a
</p>
<p>tenement-house and wants to secure a better home is a revolutionist,
</p>
<p>because the beneficial change means a revolution in his very life. I
</p>
<p>know I have to be careful what I say nowadays, but I assert that any
</p>
<p>and all means are justified in order to get rid of the present system of
</p>
<p>wage slavery. (Loud applause.) Any means, I say. If the ballot will
</p>
<p>accomplish that purpose, adopt it ; but if it will not, let us adopt some
</p>
<p>more potent means. (Applause.)
</p>
<p>"The speaker has argued in favor of Australian laws, but I know the
</p>
<p>same state of society exists there that exists here, and the laws furnish no
</p>
<p>remedy. Does any one suppose that the capitalists your masters will
</p>
<p>ever permit you to peacefully take their lands from them while they can

<p>invoke the aid of a policeman's club or a Gatling gun ? The ballot-box
</p>
<p>is useless to reform the evils of society, and there is 'not a State Socialist
</p>
<p>living who believes that a reform can be brought about peaceably. They
</p>
<p>all admit it, but they claim that it is not policy to say so. .1 am not afraid
</p>
<p>to say what I believe, whether it leads me to prison bars or the scaffold.
</p>
<p>The capitalists never have relinquished anything until they were com-
</p>
<p>pelled to, and they will not now, unless they have a change of heart, or
</p>
<p>something of that sort. But go on voting. Vote for what you want, but
</p>
<p>don't forget that the Bill of Rights gives every man the right to keep and
</p>
<p>bear arms, and when you want to vote take your little musket to the polls
</p>
<p>with you, and then your vote will be counted not before. Take the
</p>
<p>ballot ; but first put an idea, a strong arm and determination behind,
</p>
<p>and then buy yourselves good Winchester rifles. Then you will be pre-
</p>
<p>pared to fight for your rights. Men who are armed are bound to be free,
</p>
<p>and you are all wage slaves to-day because you are not."
</p>
<p>Here the applause was almost deafening. Mrs. Parsons paused and
</p>
<p>gazed around the room.
</p>
<p>668 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>" I do not care," said she, "whether there are any policemen or de-
</p>
<p>tectives here or not, or whether the newspapers want to come out with
</p>
<p>sensational head-lines about me. Go on voting, and in ten years you will
</p>
<p>find yourselves where I am now. You will be no further advanced, and
</p>
<p>then you will have to come to the revolution of force which I advocate now. "
</p>
<p>Her voice rang out strong and clear, and as she finished it seemed evi-
</p>
<p>dent from the loud applause that followed that the majority of those present
</p>
<p>were in full accord with her sentiments.
</p>
<p>Professor Orchardson then replied to his critic. He claimed that Mrs.
</p>
<p>Parsons had begun by picturing Anarchy as one of the most lovely and
</p>
<p>beautiful conditions imaginable, but before she had finished she had ad-
</p>
<p>vocated murder, force, carbines and every violent measure conceivable.
</p>
<p>She had claimed that Anarchy did not mean war, and in the same breath had
</p>
<p>urged that all means were justifiable to secure it. " A man who undertakes
</p>
<p>to philosophize upon this question," said he, " soon becomes contaminated
</p>
<p>by that horrible theory Anarchism."
</p>
<p>A few hisses were heard about the room.
</p>
<p>"I see I have no sympathy here," he continued, "and I here declare
</p>
<p>that if I live I will never speak again where Anarchists are admitted and
</p>
<p>permitted to speak."
</p>
<p>Here a storm of hisses and loud cries of "Shame " were heard on all
</p>
<p>sides, and for a moment it seemed as if trouble was imminent. The chair-
</p>
<p>man, however, succeeded in restoring order, and the speaker was about to
</p>
<p>continue his remarks, when he was interrupted by Mrs. Parsons.
</p>
<p>" Did you not advocate assassination in your lecture last night?" she
</p>
<p>asked.
</p>
<p>"I did not. I simply said that if humanity had sunk so low that men
</p>
<p>would sell themselves out, secret societies should be formed for the purpose
</p>
<p>of bringing retribution on the men who had betrayed their trusts."
</p>
<p>" You said assassination," shouted Mrs. Parsons, "and I can prove it. "
</p>
<p>" I never did and never will advocate the vicious, horrible and blood-
</p>
<p>thirsty ideas of the Anarchists, that made it so hard to argue the Socialistic
</p>
<p>question before the people," concluded the Professor, in evident disgust;

</p>
<p>"and I again repeat that I never will attend another meeting where such
</p>
<p>ideas are advocated."
</p>
<p>As the speaker took his seat, he was warmly cheered by a number
</p>
<p>present, but there was a loud murmur of dissent from the rear of the room,
</p>
<p>where Mrs. Parsons sat surrounded by her friends.
</p>
<p>The most conspicuous feature of the propaganda of the Internationale
</p>
<p>in Chicago to-day is the Sunday school movement. There are now four of
</p>
<p>these schools in successful and established operation, and a number of
</p>
<p>others are fairly started.
</p>
<p>The first was opened in the spring of 1888, at Lake View, by the

</p>
<p>"Socialistic Turn-Verein." The second was begun in August, 1888, at
</p>
<p>Jefferson, by the Turn-Verein " Fortschritt. " The third was commenced in
</p>
<p>September, at "Thalia Hall," by the "Arbeiter Bildungs-Verein" of the
</p>
<p>Northwest Side, and the fourth was started at 58 Clybourn Avenue, by the
</p>
<p>"Arbeiter Bildungs-Verein " of the North Side. The school at Lake View
</p>
<p>is frequented by about 190 children ; the school of the Turn-Verein " Fort-
</p>
<p>schritt " has from forty to fifty pupils ; the school of the Northwest Side was
</p>
<p>visited on Sunday, December 9, 1888, by 230 children, and this Verein will
</p>
<p>have to rent another hall, as the present one is not large enough to accom-
</p>
<p>modate all the pupils. The North Side school was attended by about 100
</p>
<p>children on the same day. All schools are under the supervision of the one
</p>
<p>organized on December 9, 1888, at Aurora Turn Hall. The mam mission
</p>
<p>of this school is the organization of others. It can easily be seen that the
</p>
<p>schools now established are prospering, because the number of pupils is
</p>
<p>increasing from day to day. The schools are of Socialistic and Anarchistic
</p>
<p>origin. Nothing is taught relating to dynamite or bombs. The German
</p>
<p>language is used in all the schools, and all the ordinary branches of educa-
</p>
<p>tion are embraced in the curriculum, but underneath and above all is the
</p>
<p>spirit of contempt for law and religion. The children are instructed that
</p>
<p>religion is nothing but a humbug ; that there exists no God and no devil, no
</p>
<p>heaven and no hell, and that Christianity is only a preventive system
</p>
<p>adopted by the capitalists to rule the working people and keep them under.
</p>
<p>After this they are to be taught the spirit of revolution. In all, the main
</p>
<p>point is agitation for Socialism and Anarchy.
</p>
<p>As showing the spirit of the Anarchist Sunday schools, I append the
</p>
<p>following appeal for Christmas presents from the Arbeiter-Zeitung of Decem-
</p>
<p>ber 7, 1888. It seems to me that it leaves very little to be said, except per-
</p>
<p>haps to point out that 58 Clybourn Avenue is a low-class groggery, and that
</p>
<p>it was in the very room in which the school is held that the Anarchists who
</p>
<p>were to carry out Engel's plan on the 4th of May, 1886, secured their sup-
</p>
<p>plies of dynamite and bombs :

<p>Christmas Presents for the Scholars of the Sunday School of the North Side.

<p>adopted the following : A presentation of Christmas presents and a lottery for the children
</p>
<p>of the Sunday school will be held at 58 Clybourn Avenue on Christmas day. Every one is

<p>will help us to educate our children to become useful persons also parents, their friends

<p>this noble cause. Leave your contributions for the presentation of Christmas presents or for

<p>the dressing of the Christmas tree for the dear little ones until Saturday, December 22, with

<p>ARBEITER BILDUNGS-VEREIN.
</p>
<p>Dr. E. G. Kleinoldt, who lives at 591 Sedgwick Street, is one of the
</p>
<p>chief teachers. He is an enthusiast in instructing innocent children that
</p>
<p>IRRELIGIOUS SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 6;r
</p>
<p>there is no God and no hereafter. He tells his small charges that priests-
</p>
<p>and ministers alike are swindlers, and there are in this city fathers who
</p>
<p>bring their children to the rear of a beer saloon on Sundays to be taught
</p>
<p>such doctrine by a drunkard.
</p>
<p>On Saturday night, December i, 1888, a dance was in progress in Yon-
</p>
<p>dorf's Hall. Officer Lorch, of my command, called in to see what kind of a
</p>
<p>gathering it was. Entering the hall, he saw Kleinoldt with three young
</p>
<p>men, talking very busily. The officer approached near enough to hear that
</p>
<p>Kleinoldt was talking about dynamite, and finally heard him tell the young
</p>
<p>men how to make bombs, explaining the process in the same manner as-
</p>
<p>Engel had done. He also suggested that if his hearers would make bombs
</p>
<p>and put them under "the leafers of policemen," it would make the " blood-
</p>
<p>hounds" jump. The officer approached Kleinoldt and said:
</p>
<p>" This is not an Anarchist meeting. Stop your talk, or I will put you out."
</p>
<p>Kleinoldt made some insulting remarks, and the officer took him by the
</p>
<p>back of the neck and pushed him out of the hall. This was the last of him
</p>
<p>there for that night, but the young men he had been talking to were not
</p>
<p>Anarchists. One of the three followed him out on the sidewalk and there
</p>
<p>met a friend whom he told what Kleinoldt had advised. The newcomer,
</p>
<p>who happened to carry a large turkey, was a little under the influence of
</p>
<p>liquor himself, but was sober enough to oppose Anarchy. He followed
</p>
<p>Kleinoldt, struck him with the turkey, knocked him down and broke his
</p>
<p>eye-glasses, apparently for the purpose of demonstrating to the worthy ped-
</p>
<p>agogue that all people who drink too much beer are not necessarily Anar-
</p>
<p>chists.
</p>
<p>This man Kleinoldt was interviewed a short time ago by a reporter of
</p>
<p>the Chicago Herald. While other Anarchist pedagogues are loth to com-
</p>
<p>municate their plans and doings, Kleinoldt talked readily, and what he said
</p>
<p>seems to me sufficiently interesting to repeat here.
</p>
<p>"We do not teach Socialism or Anarchism in our Sunday-schools, and
</p>
<p>the newspapers do us an injustice when they say so," said Dr. Kleinoldt.
</p>
<p>" The object of our Sunday schools is to keep the children away from the
</p>
<p>influence of the Jesuits, who teach the Bible, religious songs, and church

<p>doctrine, subjects that are very distasteful to us who are Socialists. I was
</p>
<p>one of the prime movers in the project to organize schools to be held on
</p>
<p>Sundays all over the city, which shall be open to children of all parents who
</p>
<p>are opposed to the hurtful influences of church instruction. While it is
</p>
<p>possibly true that most of those in attendance are the offspring of Socialists
</p>
<p>and Anarchists, still it is by no means restricted to them, for in one school,
</p>
<p>at 58 Clybourn Avenue, as well as others, you will find those whose fathers
</p>
<p>have no sympathy with our advanced ideas on sociology."
</p>
<p>" What do you teach at these schools ? " asked the reporter.
</p>
<p>" Our course takes in reading, writing, natural history, geography, liter-
</p>
<p>672 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>ature, general history and morality so much of ethics as young minds
</p>
<p>are capable of receiving."
</p>
<p>"And you do not teach the tenets of Anarchy? " queried the reporter.
</p>
<p>"By no means. We say nothing of bombs, dynamite, overthrow of
</p>
<p>kingdoms, uprooting of our present social system, or anything of that kind.
</p>
<p>What would be the use of it ? If you had a correct appreciation of the
</p>
<p>principles of Anarchy and Socialism you would readily understand that the
</p>
<p>questions are too grave for the apprehension of juvenile minds. Later on
</p>
<p>well, that is something else."
</p>
<p>"Still, Doctor, your teachers are thoroughly imbued with these senti-
</p>
<p>ments, and it would be only natural for you to desire, if you are honest in
</p>
<p>your convictions, that these young people should grow up in your peculiar
</p>
<p>faith."
</p>
<p>"That is another matter," replied Dr. Kleinoldt, regarding the reporter
</p>
<p>fixedly through his spectacles. " As the twig is bent the tree's inclined.
</p>
<p>We are honest in what we profess, else why should we profess at all, since
</p>
<p>we have nothing to gain but obloquy, in the present at least ? Being honest
</p>
<p>and believing that our teachings are best for the human family, we should
</p>
<p>be strange beings indeed if we were not anxious to have our children grow
</p>
<p>up into our faith. What I have said is, and I repeat it, that we do not teach
</p>
<p>Anarchistic or Socialistic principles to the pupils in our Sunday schools."
</p>
<p>The reporter here read to the Doctor a paragraph from one of the
</p>
<p>Chicago dailies to the effect that at the school held in the rear of Rachau
</p>
<p>Bros', saloon, corner of Lincoln Avenue and Halsted Street, the day before,
</p>
<p>a teacher had dilated upon the death of Spies and Parsons, declaring they
</p>
<p>were murdered by the capitalists and that they were martyrs.
</p>
<p>" Of that I know nothing. All I know is that such is not the design
</p>
<p>of our schools. Such talk is not heard at our school in the rear of the
</p>
<p>saloon at 58 Clybourn Avenue. We use the same books that are used
</p>
<p>in the day schools, and what we teach is as I have told you before
</p>
<p>only this and nothing more."
</p>
<p>"Put since your teachers hold to these peculiar views, and since chil-
</p>
<p>dren have investigating minds being eager to ask questions is there

</p>
<p>anything to prevent teachers from defining their views even if they do
</p>
<p>not enter into arguments to demonstrate the tenableness of their position ? "
</p>
<p>" I repeat again, there are many children in attendance upon our schools
</p>
<p>whose parents are not Anarchists or Socialists. Those who are hear these
</p>
<p>opinions at their homes. Those who are not do not hear them."
</p>
<p>"True; but there are some, doubtless, in every class, who have heard
</p>
<p>at their homes the teachings of Anarchy or Socialism ; they may ask ques-
</p>
<p>tions. Is there anything to prevent the teachers from replying to them
</p>
<p>in such manner as to indoctrinate the others in this faith ? "
</p>
<p>" It is possible, I admit. But I say again, it is not so in our school.

</p>
<p>Indeed, most of the children are too small to know anything about such
</p>
<p>matters. You will say time will correct that. I add that our primary
</p>
<p>object is the education of the young people. We teach in German alto-
</p>
<p>gether, because the children learn English in the public schools. They
</p>
<p>all attend the latter, because it is a primary
</p>
<p>principle with us that it is education alone that j
</p>
<p>can make men free. In addition to the studies
</p>
<p>named, we teach music and singing, and we
</p>
<p>hold a session at 58 Clybourn Avenue in the
</p>
<p>afternoon of each Sunday, when teachers from

<p>He spoke carefully, and without excitement.

</p>
<p>a brief pause, "we do not teach anything of

<p>what is termed religion, because we do not

<p>believe in that. We do teach morals, the duties we owe to our neighbors,

<p>the great principles of right and wrong. We desire the children to grow

<p>up into Socialists, that they may be worthy successors of their parents ;
</p>
<p>but we do not think the Sunday school we

<p>have organized is the proper place to incul-

<p>have dilated upon the " martyrdom " of Spies, Parsons, Fischer and Engel,
</p>
<p>declaring that they died for a glorious cause, and that those officials who
</p>
<p>674 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>were instrumental in their arrest, and those who took part in the trial and
</p>
<p>at the execution, are guilty of the vilest of crimes. At one of the schools,
</p>
<p>a teacher even went so far as to allude to the Savior as the lazy loafer of
</p>
<p>Nazareth. It will not demand a very close reading " between the lines " of
</p>
<p>the interview with Dr. Kleinoldt, however, to find out that, whatever the
</p>
<p>motive of those who have inaugurated this movement, the ultimate result
</p>
<p>will be the same as though the open and expressed object were the dis-
</p>
<p>semination of those views now universally regarded among civilized nations
</p>
<p>as subversive of all government. The schools are organized for the purpose
</p>
<p>of sowing in the minds of innocent children the seeds of atheism, dis-
</p>
<p>content and lawlessness.
</p>
<p>The Sunday school movement is only one feature of the general plan of
</p>
<p>the revolutionists. The Socialists fear as heartily as they hate the church,
</p>
<p>and of late they have had especial reason, from their standpoint, for both.
</p>
<p>Both Catholic and Protestant churches located in German, Bohemian and
</p>
<p>Polish sections have recently extended their facilities for reaching the youth
</p>
<p>of their nationalities, and hundreds of children have been gathered into
</p>
<p>Christian schools on Sundays, thus taking them for a brief while on that
</p>
<p>day from the squalid streets upon which they roam without restraint, and
</p>
<p>bringing them in contact with Christian influences. Even scores of chil-
</p>
<p>dren of Socialistic parents have had this experience. The great aim of the
</p>
<p>Internationals now, as always, is to increase their numerical strength. To
</p>
<p>do this they hold it necessary to establish secular Sunday schools wherein
</p>
<p>the principles of Socialism will be taught and where children will be
</p>
<p>made to despise, though they may obey, the laws.
</p>
<p>It need only be added here that all the schools of the Socialists now
</p>
<p>in operation in Chicago are held either in the rear or in the basements of
</p>
<p>beer saloons.
</p>
<p>Judge Tuley, in his decision on the application for an injunction, stated
</p>
<p>that "there are Christian Anarchists. " I venture the assertion, however,
</p>
<p>that the learned jurist has never seen one of that class. I know that I have
</p>
<p>not, and I never expect to see one. Christianity and Anarchy are entirely
</p>
<p>opposite. While it is possible of course that a man professing the religion

<p>of Christ should be blinded by the plausible preachings of the Anarchists,
</p>
<p>still the hallucination would be only temporary. Religion and Anarchy, as

<p>I understand and have seen it, do not and never will go together.

<p>The conspirator Hronek, at his trial, was asked if he believed in God.

<p>Charles L. Bodendick, twenty-five years old, 5 feet 4 inches tall, weighing
</p>
<p>150 pounds, was arrested by Officer Hanley for robbing Justice White, March
</p>
<p>THE REBEL VAGABOND:
</p>
<p>675
</p>
<p>18, 1886, and was held to the Criminal Court in $1,500 bonds. He was tried
</p>
<p>and sentenced to the penitentiary in Joliet for one year. During his trial ic
</p>
<p>was demonstrated that he was a thorough Anarchist. The Arbeiter-Zeitung
</p>
<p>then called him a "crank" and said that he was crazy. Before he was
</p>
<p>arrested, however, he had made his home about the Arbeiter-Zeitung office,
</p>
<p>and at that time he had been looked on as a valuable man. The poor fel-
</p>
<p>low had kept hanging around there, reading their misleading trash, until
</p>
<p>he was destitute and a vagrant. The next steps were robbery and the
</p>
<p>penitentiary.
</p>
<p>After his release from prison Bodendick came back to the city, and, roam-
</p>
<p>ing about from place to place, finally fell into his old ways again, living on
</p>
<p>wind and Anarchy. He grew more
</p>
<p>desperate even than before his ar-
</p>
<p>rest. He wanted to manufacture
</p>
<p>something stronger than dynamite.
</p>
<p>A card was given to him by Dyer
</p>
<p>D. Lum, and he called at the Public
</p>
<p>Library for the "Techno-Chemical
</p>
<p>Receipt Book," K 4314. On page
</p>
<p>30 of this book Bodendick learned
</p>
<p>what he knew of the make-up of
</p>
<p>explosives. He admitted that he
</p>
<p>wanted to use sulphur, saltpeter
</p>
<p>and soda potash. He also procured
</p>
<p>other books on explosives, and he
</p>
<p>finally purchased a quantity of ma-
</p>
<p>terial and went to his room to ex- CHARLES L. BODENDICK.
</p>
<p>periment. But before he had From a Photograph taken by the Police.
</p>
<p>learned very much he was arrested. Bodendick was kept in the Central Sta-
</p>
<p>tion in the sweat-box for two weeks. He was defiant at first, but finally sent
</p>
<p>word to the Inspector that he wanted to talk with him. He was brought to the
</p>
<p>office, and after he had given a lot of information, and promised to leave the city

</p>
<p>at once, he was released. The Anarchists claim that he never did "squeal."
</p>
<p>This Bodendick was an odd genius. Here is verbatim et literatim a
</p>
<p>poem in which he melodiously voiced his sentiments some years ago :

<p>I' ve toiled hard, sometime ago,
</p>
<p>From early morn till late.
</p>
<p>That I aint worth some millions now
</p>
<p>Is really too bad.
</p>
<p>You see, a generous toiling man
</p>
<p>Gets never much ahead ;
</p>
<p>For which a rascal allways can

<p>Rob men of life and (e)state.

</p>
<p>That time I was quiet ingnorant
</p>
<p>of, who was my enemy real,
</p>
<p>That I've become to you a torment

<p>Is only the result you feel.

<p>Makes me a Rebell-Vagabond.
</p>
<p>The most serious recent development of the spirit of revolt and disorder,,
</p>
<p>however, is that shown in the attempt of the men Hronek and Capek to
</p>
<p>assassinate Judges Gary and Grinnell and Inspector Bonfield.
</p>
<p>In July of 1888, Judge Grinnell sent for me and told me that he had
</p>
<p>been informed by a Bohemian citizen that there was a conspiracy afoot to
</p>
<p>murder himself, Gary and Bonfield, and that he thought there was something
</p>
<p>in the information. It appears that there were three Bohemian Anarchists,
</p>
<p>John Hronek, Frank Capek and Frank Chleboun, who had determined to
</p>
<p>avenge the "martyrdom," as they called it, of the Anarchist leaders.

</p>
<p>Chleboun was never in real sympathy with the others, and when the affair
</p>
<p>began to grow very serious he went to a Bohemian friend and confided to
</p>
<p>him the plot. This gentleman at once advised Judge Grinnell. Among
</p>
<p>the details was the fact that three men had examined the Judge's house on
</p>
<p>July 4th, with a view to blowing it up if a good opportunity offered, and
</p>
<p>the Judge remembered having seen three suspicious-looking men loitering
</p>
<p>about Aldine Square on that day. They had eyed him so strangely that
</p>
<p>his attention was attracted to them. This fact made him attach much
</p>
<p>weight to the story he had been told. The Judge wished me to conduct the
</p>
<p>investigation, but the suspects all lived in Inspector Bonfield's district, and
</p>
<p>I urged that the inquiry should be made by him, of course promising to co-
</p>
<p>operate as heartily as I could. After this Bonfield, the Judge and I had a.
</p>
<p>THE HRONEK CONSPIRACY. 677
</p>
<p>conference in which we went over the whole ground. We had all the facts
</p>
<p>in the case pretty well in hand. On the morning of July i7th, Bonfield was
</p>
<p>ready to strike, and the arrests were made. On the evening before warrants
</p>
<p>were sworn out for these three men, and at 4 A.M. Bonfield drove Lieut.
</p>
<p>Elliott past Hronek's house, 2952 Farrell Street, so that he might know it.
</p>
<p>Officers Rowan, Miller, Nordrum, Murtha, Styx and Meichowsky assisted
</p>
<p>in the arrests.
</p>
<p>In describing what followed Inspector Bonfield said :
</p>
<p>" We had reason to believe that Hronek, who only occupied the two rear
</p>
<p>rooms of a two-story frame dwelling, had dynamite, a revolver and a formid-
</p>
<p>able-looking dagger, which we had been told was poisoned. We had also
</p>
<p>been given to understand that Hronek was a reckless fellow of the Lingg
</p>
<p>type and would offer a desperate resistance, and for that reason, in order
</p>
<p>not to jeopardize the lives of any of our men, we thought it prudent, instead
</p>
<p>of entering the house, to catch him unawares when he came out early in the
</p>
<p>morning. At the side of the house is a covered stairway leading from the
</p>
<p>ground to Hronek's rooms, and about seven o'clock we saw our man come
</p>
<p>down these, and he was immediately arrested by Officers Nordrum and one
</p>
<p>or two others. Leaving one or two men to watch the house, we took the
</p>
<p>prisoner, who appeared utterly indifferent, and astonished perhaps, to the
</p>
<p>nearest patrol-box, called the wagon, and sent him to Deering Street Sta-
</p>
<p>tion, whence he was removed to the Central Station later on.
</p>
<p>"We then searched the house, and in a sort of closet we found a small
</p>
<p>quantity of dynamite in the original JEtna No. 2 packages. In the bed-room
</p>
<p>we found our information to be true, for under the pillow on which Hronek
</p>
<p>had a short time previous been sleeping we found a vicious-looking dagger,
</p>
<p>in a leather sheath, and a revolver. In addition to these we also found in
</p>
<p>the rooms several bombs, some of which are empty and some of which are
</p>
<p>loaded. -The bombs are made of cast-iron piping, plugged at each end.
</p>
<p>The pipe had been made for some other purpose and turned to that use, and
</p>
<p>the bombs were four or five inches long and about an inch and a half in
</p>
<p>diameter."
</p>
<p>Frank Capek was arrested at his home, 498 West Twentieth Street, at

</p>
<p>the same time as was Frank Chleboun, who was found at Zion Place.
</p>
<p>Capek's house was not searched, as it was known that he had made away
</p>
<p>with the dynamite that he had had there.
</p>
<p>The arrests caused the greatest excitement in the city as soon as it
</p>
<p>became generally known what was the charge.
</p>
<p>About the truth of it there could be no doubt. Hronek was a desperate
</p>
<p>fellow, quite ready and willing for any violence. He was an enthusiastic
</p>
<p>Anarchist, and a great admirer of the "martyrs," as he called them, and he
</p>
<p>had a regular arsenal of explosives and weapons.
</p>
<p>Chleboun's story was a singular one. He was a tailor who had come from
</p>
<p>Bohemia to Chicago in 1882. He met Hronek shortly after the Haymarket
</p>
<p>riot, and the two struck up an acquaintanceship. With Frank Capek they
</p>
<p>discussed Anarchy and the trial of the leaders, and all went well as long as
</p>
<p>678
</p>
<p>ANARCHY ANDANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>they confined themselves to theory and beer.
</p>
<p>Chleboun was one of those weak-minded people
</p>
<p>who like to play at conspiracy, but he soon found
</p>
<p>that he had allied himself with desperate and dan-
</p>
<p>gerous men and that the chances were altogether
</p>
<p>in favor of his own neck paying the penalty for his
</p>
<p>comrades' work. This alarmed him, and he seems
</p>
<p>to have tried to draw away from them. But they
</p>
<p>would not let him. For a time he lent them money
</p>
<p>and tried to get along with them, but they made
</p>
<p>his life a burden to him. In October, 1887, he
</p>
<p>t wanted to visit the old country, and desired to take
</p>
<p>' out citizen's papers before he left. It shows the
</p>
<p>relations between the men, that Hronek and Capek would not help him to
</p>
<p>get naturalized until he had formally agreed to the plot to kill Grinnell,
</p>
<p>Gary and Bonfield. They, also demanded $25 from him, and he paid it.
</p>
<p>He returned from Europe in December, and they at once pounced on him

<p>the murder of the three men coolly and deliberately ; how he had provided
</p>
<p>dynamite made up into tin bombs, and in other ways, and had secured
</p>
<p>a poisoned dagger, as well as a pistol. Capek seemed to concur in what
</p>
<p>the others did, but Hronek was the undoubted leader. Among other
</p>
<p>things Hronek told them was that he had met
</p>
<p>Inspector Bonfield, and had had a safe chance to
</p>
<p>kill him, but that he had had no arms with him
</p>
<p>and could not do it. Hronek was very angry over
</p>
<p>his disappointment. Chleboun described the visit
</p>
<p>of the three men himself, Hronek and Capek
</p>
<p>to Judge Grinnell's house in Aldine Square, and

<p>the reconnoissance they made.

</p>
<p>AS regards the present plans and movements of the reds in Europe, of
</p>
<p>course it is almost impossible to obtain an adequate conception here.
</p>
<p>It is known, however, that the French, German, English and Belgian gov-
</p>
<p>ernments have only recently adopted most stringent measures, the effect of
</p>
<p>which will undoubtedly be to send some very undesirable immigrants to our
</p>
<p>hospitable shores.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the measures taken by the French Government, it is
</p>
<p>reported as tolerably certain that the Revolutionary Congress will meet at
</p>
<p>Paris, although there is a pressure to have the date of the session delayed
</p>
<p>until October. Much will depend, probably, upon the proceedings of the
</p>
<p>proposed meeting of German, Swiss and Austrian Socialists at Zurich the
</p>
<p>coming summer.
</p>
<p>With all their talk of universal brotherhood and a grand combination of
</p>
<p>the proletariat of every nation against tryanny, race hatreds are very strong
</p>
<p>among the Socialists of Europe. A French Communist would be more
</p>
<p>likely to cut a German Socialist's throat than labor with him for the over-
</p>
<p>throw of the common oppressor.
</p>
<p>The social conference soon to convene at The Hague, it is said, will ask
</p>
<p>the German leaders to take the decisive step of annulling the Zurich meet-
</p>
<p>ing, in order to give the Paris congress the more importance and avoid
</p>
<p>giving any possible offense by such action as may be taken there. It is well
</p>
<p>known that Bebel, Liebknecht and their immediate followers have no par-
</p>
<p>ticular love for the dynamite faction of the Paris Communists, but there are
</p>

<p>common cause. By their unceasing labor a large proportion of the rank
</p>
<p>and file of the German army have been won over to the Socialistic move-

<p>ment, and they do not despair of allaying the French repugnance to affiliat-

</p>
<p>The London celebration of the anniversary of the Paris Commune on
</p>
<p>the night of March 18, 1889, consisted of a small crowd of boozy, beery,,
</p>
<p>682
</p>
<p>VERESTCHAGIN'S VIEWS. 683
</p>
<p>pot-valiant, squalid, frowsy, sodden Whitechapel outcasts who shrieked,
</p>
<p>and fought in a small hall in their district under the eye of a single police-
</p>
<p>man.
</p>
<p>"Better not go in, sir," the policeman said to a correspondent who en-
</p>
<p>tered the door of the small hall at 87 Commonwealth Road. " There ain't
</p>
<p>no danger, but it's very unpleasant."
</p>
<p>It was the fumes of scores of dirty pipes and a thousand other causes
</p>
<p>that made the air almost unbearable. About two hundred people, a fourth
</p>
<p>of whom were lushed, soggy Whitechapel women, were in the low-ceil-
</p>
<p>inged hall, while a long-haired Pole was screaming an address from the
</p>
<p>platform. He cursed and swore with frantic blasphemy, and called upon
</p>
<p>his hearers to arm themselves and wade to liberty through blood. When-
</p>
<p>ever he uttered the word "blood," the muddled and maudlin crowd set up
</p>
<p>a shriek of "Blood, blood, blood ! " that was deafening. All of the women
</p>
<p>and most of the men had soiled red flags and handkerchiefs, which they
</p>
<p>waved in the air as they shrieked " Blood ! " in chorus. Then they would
</p>
<p>sink back into drunken indifference till the word " blood " was mentioned
</p>
<p>again.
</p>
<p>Two women and a man, says the correspondent, lay in senseless stupor,
</p>
<p>with the crowd treading on them. One woman's rags did not half cover her.
</p>
<p>An illiterate Englishman pushed the Pole aside and began to harangue the
</p>
<p>people from the platform. It was the most shameless, ribald and obscene
</p>
<p>harangue imaginable. In the midst of it one woman struck another with a
</p>
<p>piece of a broken beer glass, and the two females began to fight like cats.
</p>
<p>Faces were cut and bleeding. No one paid the slightest attention except
</p>
<p>the policeman, who looked indifferently on. Presently one of the women
</p>
<p>ran sobbing from the hall with her face streaming blood. Another woman
</p>
<p>started after her, when a man made a sign to a policeman, and she was re-
</p>
<p>strained. Then a neighbor plucked the correspondent's sleeve :
</p>
<p>" Don't let that nasty scene deceive you," he said shortly, " it doesn't
</p>
<p>mean that Socialism is dead in London. It means that it is more intelligent.
</p>
<p>They've left off shouting in public and begun to work under cover. This
</p>
<p>thing to-night proves it."

</p>
<p>The following, from the pen of Vassili Verestchagin, the eminent Rus-
</p>
<p>sian painter, whose realistic representations of battle scenes have created a
</p>
<p>great sensation wherever exhibited, and who is also a writer of great
</p>
<p>ability, will show how the situation in Europe as regards Socialism, Anarchy
</p>
<p>and Nihilism appears to one close and intelligent observer :
</p>
<p>"There is no gainsaying the fact that all the other questions of our time
</p>
<p>are paling before the question of Socialism that advances on us, threaten-
</p>
<p>ingly, like a tremendous thunder-cloud.
</p>
<p>" The masses that have been for centuries leading a life of expectancy,
</p>
<p>while hanging on the very borders of starvation, are willing to wait no more.
</p>
<p>Their former hopes in the future are discarded ; their appetites are whetted,
</p>
<p>684 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>and they are clamoring for arrears, which means now the division of all the
</p>
<p>riches, and so as to make the division more lasting, they are claiming that
</p>
<p>talents and capacities should be leveled down to one standard, all workers
</p>
<p>of progress and comfort alike drawing the same pay. They are striving to
</p>
<p>reconstruct society on new foundations, and, in case of opposition to their
</p>
<p>aims, they threaten to apply the torch to all the monuments pertaining to
</p>
<p>an order that, according to them, has already outlived its usefulness ; they
</p>
<p>threaten to blow up the public buildings, the churches, the art galleries,
</p>
<p>libraries and museums a downright religion of despair ! . . .
</p>
<p>"My friend the late General Skobeleff once asked me, 'How do you
</p>
<p>understand the movement of the Socialists and the Anarchists ? ' He owned
</p>
<p>to it that he himself did not understand at all what they aimed at. 'What
</p>
<p>do they want ? What are they striving to attain ? '
</p>
<p>" ' First of all,' I answered, ' those people object to wars between nations ;
</p>
<p>again, their appreciation of art is very limited, the art of painting not
</p>
<p>excluded. Thus, if they ever come into power, you, with your strategic
</p>
<p>combinations, and I, with my pictures, will both be shelved immediately.
</p>
<p>Do you understand this ? '
</p>
<p>"'Yes, I understand this,' rejoined Skobeleff, 'and from this on I am
</p>
<p>determined to fight them.'
</p>
<p>"There is no mistaking the fact that, as I have said before, society is
</p>
<p>seriously threatened at the hands of a large mass of people counting hun-
</p>
<p>dreds of millions. Those are the people who, for generations, during
</p>
<p>entire centuries, have been on the brink of starvation, poorly clad, living in
</p>
<p>filthy and unhealthy quarters ; paupers, and such people as have scarcely
</p>
<p>any property, or no property at all. Well, who is it that is to blame for
</p>
<p>their poverty are they not themselves to be blamed for it?
</p>
<p>" No, it would be unjust to lay all the blame at their door ; it is more
</p>
<p>likely that society at large is more to blame for their condition than they
</p>
<p>are themselves.
</p>
<p>" Is there any way out of the situation ?
</p>
<p>" Certainly there is. Christ, our Great Teacher, has long ago pointed
</p>
<p>out the way in which the rich and the powerful could remedy the situation

</p>
<p>without bringing things to a revolutionary pass, without any upheaval of the
</p>
<p>existing social order, if they would only seriously take care of the miserable ;
</p>
<p>that certainly would have insured them the undisturbed enjoyment of the
</p>
<p>bulk of their fortune. But there is little hope of a peaceful solution of the
</p>
<p>question now ; it is certain that the well-to-do classes will still prefer to
</p>
<p>remain Christian in name only ; they will still hope that palliative meas-
</p>
<p>ures will be sufficient to remedy the situation ; or else, believing the danger
</p>
<p>to be distant yet, they will not be disposed to give up much ; while the pau-
</p>
<p>pers though formerly they were ready for a compromise may be soon
</p>
<p>found unwilling to take the pittance offered them.
</p>
<p>" What do they want, then ?
</p>
<p>"Nothing less than the equalization of riches in the society to come;
</p>
<p>they claim the material as well as the moral equalization of all rights, trades,
</p>
<p>all capacities and talents ; as we have already said, they strive to under-
</p>
<p>mine all the foundations of the existing state of society, and, in inaugurating
</p>
<p>a new order of things they claim to be able to open a real era of liberty,
</p>
<p>equality and fraternity, instead of the shadows of those lofty things, as
</p>
<p>existing now. . . .
</p>
<p>" I do not mean to go into the discussion of the matter ; I would not
</p>
<p>THE DEFENDERS OF SOCIETY. 685
</p>
<p>pretend to point out how much justice or injustice, how much soundness or
</p>
<p>unsoundness there is in these claims ; I state only the fact that there is a
</p>
<p>deep gulf between the former cries for bread and the sharply formulated
</p>
<p>claims of the present. It is evident that the appetite of the masses has
</p>
<p>grown within the past centuries, and the bill which they intend to present
</p>
<p>for payment will not be a small one.
</p>
<p>"Who will be required to pay this bill?
</p>
<p>"Society, most certainly.
</p>
<p>"Will it be done willingly ?
</p>
<p>"Evidently not.
</p>
<p>" Consequently there will be complications, quarrels, civil wars.
</p>
<p>"Certainly there will be serious complications ; they are already casting
</p>
<p>their shadows before them in the shape of disturbances of a Socialistic char-
</p>
<p>acter that are originating here and there. In America, most likely, those
</p>
<p>disturbances are lesser and less pointed, but in Europe, in France and Bel-
</p>
<p>gium, for instance, such disorders assume a very threatening aspect.
</p>
<p>" Who is likely to be victorious in this struggle ?
</p>
<p>" Unless Napoleon I. was wrong in his assertion that victory will always
</p>
<p>remain with the gros bataillons, the ' regulators ' will win. Their numbers
</p>
<p>will be very great ; whoever knows human nature will understand that all
</p>
<p>such as have not much to lose will, at the decisive moment, join the claims
</p>
<p>of those who have nothing to lose.
</p>
<p>"It is generally supposed that the danger is not so imminent yet ; but,
</p>
<p>as far as I was able to judge, the impendence of the danger varies in differ-
</p>
<p>ent countries. France, for instance that long-suffering country which is
</p>
<p>forever experimenting on herself, whether it be in social or scientific ques-
</p>
<p>tions, or in politics is the nearest to a crisis; then follow Belgium and
</p>
<p>other countries.
</p>
<p>" It is very possible that even the present generation will witness some-
</p>
<p>thing serious in that respect. As to the coming generations, there is no doubt
</p>
<p>that they will assist at a thorough reconstruction of the social structure in
</p>
<p>all countries.

</p>
<p>the disorders incited by them, generally produce a great sensation in society.
</p>
<p>But no sooner are the disorders suppressed, than society relapses again into
</p>
<p>its usual unconcern, and no one gives a thought to the fact that the fre-
</p>
<p>quency of those painful symptoms, recurring with so much persistency, is
</p>
<p>in itself a sign of disease.
</p>
<p>" Far-seeing people begin to realize that palliative measures are of no
</p>
<p>more use ; that a change of governments and of rulers will not avail any
</p>
<p>more ; and that nothing is left but to await developments contingent on
</p>
<p>the attitude of the opposed parties the energetic determination of the
</p>
<p>well-to-do classes, not to yield, and that of the proletaires, to keep their
</p>
<p>courage and persevere. . .
</p>
<p>"The only consolation remaining to the rich consists in the fact that the
</p>
<p>'regulators' have not had time yet to organize their forces for a successful
</p>
<p>struggle with society. This is true to a certain extent. But, though they
</p>
<p>do it slowly, the 'regulators' are perfecting their organization all the time;
</p>
<p>yet, on the other hand, can we say that society is well enough organized not
</p>
<p>to stand in dread of attack ?
</p>
<p>"Who are the recognized and official defenders of society?
</p>
<p>" The army and the church.
</p>
<p>686 ANARCHY AND ANA R CHISTS.
</p>
<p>1 A soldier, there is no doubt of it, is a good support ; he represents a
</p>
<p>solid defense ; the only trouble about him is that the soldier himself begins
</p>
<p>to get weary of his ungrateful part. It is likely that for many years to come
</p>
<p>yet the soldier will shoot with a light heart at such as are called his ' ene-
</p>
<p>mies ; ' but the time is not far distant when he will refuse to shoot at his
</p>
<p>own people.
</p>
<p>"Who is a good soldier? Only ona* to whom you can point out his
</p>
<p>father, his mother or his brother in the crowd, saying, ' Those are enemies
</p>
<p>of society, kill them' and who will obey.
</p>
<p>" I may remark here, in passing, that it occurred to me to refer to this
</p>
<p>idea in a conversation I had with the well-known French writer and thinker,
</p>
<p>Alexandre Dumas, fils, and with what success? Conceding the justice of
</p>
<p>the apprehension, he had no other comforting suggestion to offer than to
</p>
<p>say : ' Oh, yes, the soldier will shoot yet ! '
</p>
<p>" The other defender of society, the priest, has been less ill-used than
</p>
<p>the soldier, and consequently he is not so tired of his task ; but, on the
</p>
<p>other hand, people begin to tire of him, less heed is paid to his words, and
</p>
<p>there arises a doubt as to the truth of all that he preaches.
</p>
<p>" There was a time when it was possible to tell the people that there is
</p>
<p>but one sun in the heavens as there is but one God-appointed king in the
</p>
<p>country. As stars of the first, second, third and fourth magnitude are
</p>
<p>grouping themselves around the sun, so the powerful, the rich, the poor and
</p>
<p>the miserable surround the king on earth. And, as all that appeared
</p>
<p>plausible, people used to believe that such arrangements are as they ought
</p>
<p>to be. All was accepted, all went on smoothly ; none of such things can be
</p>
<p>advanced nowadays, however ; no one will be ready to believe in them. . .
</p>
<p>" Clearly, things assume a serious aspect. Suppose the day comes when
</p>
<p>the priests will entirely lose their hold on the people, when the soldiers will
</p>
<p>turn their guns muzzles down where will society look for bulwarks then?
</p>
<p>Is it possible that it has no more reliable defense ?
</p>
<p>" Certainly, it has such a defense, and it is nothing else but talents, and
</p>
<p>their representatives in science, literature and art in all its ramifications.
</p>
<p>" Art must and will defend society. Its influence is less apparent and

</p>
<p>palpable, but it is very great ; it might even be said that its influence over
</p>
<p>the minds, the hearts and the actions of people is enormous, unsurpassed,
</p>
<p>unrivaled. Art must and will defend society with all the more care and
</p>
<p>earnestness, because its devotees know that the ' regulators ' are not dis-
</p>
<p>posed to give them the honorable, respectable position they occupy now
</p>
<p>since, according to them, a good pair of boots is more useful than a good
</p>
<p>picture, a novel or a statue. Those people declare that talent is luxury ;
</p>
<p>that talent is aristocratic, and that, consequently, talent has to be brought
</p>
<p>down from its pedestal to the common level a principle to which we shall
</p>
<p>never submit.
</p>
<p>" Let us not deceive ourselves. There will arise new talents, which will
</p>
<p>gradually adapt themselves to new conditions, if such will prevail, and their
</p>
<p>works may perhaps gain from it, but we shall not agree to the principle of
</p>
<p>general demolition and reconstruction, when such have no other foundation
</p>
<p>but the well-known thesis : ' Let us destroy everything and clear the ground ;
</p>
<p>as to the reconstruction about that we shall see later on. ' We shall
</p>
<p>defend and advocate the improvement of the existing things by means of
</p>
<p>peaceful and gradual measures."
</p>
<p>A NEW ERA OF REVOLT. 687
</p>
<p>That is Verestchagin's view. It is certainly original and at least presents
</p>
<p>matter for serious reflection to the thoughtful, even though his deductions
</p>
<p>are not agreed to.
</p>
<p>Only recently a tremendous sensation was caused by the discovery of a
</p>
<p>dynamite bomb factory in Zurich, secretly conducted by students, and the
</p>
<p>tracing therefrom of a Nihilist conspiracy against the Czar, with extensive
</p>
<p>ramifications throughout Russia. Official and court circles in St. Petersburg
</p>
<p>were panic-stricken at the news, and the public journals, as usual, were
</p>
<p>promptly forbidden publishing information, making comment, or saying a
</p>
<p>word on the subject. In the meantime the police pushed investigation in
</p>
<p>all directions and a large number of arrests were made.
</p>
<p>Following up the traces of the plot, they found in a street of the capital
</p>
<p>most important evidences of its ramifications in St. Petersburg. This
</p>
<p>conspiracy was said to be more formidable than any preceding one. Nor
</p>
<p>was the danger diminished by the discoveries made. The arrests were only
</p>
<p>of minor people, and these maintained unbroken fidelity to their leaders,
</p>
<p>refusing to divulge even the little they were allowed to know.
</p>
<p>All over the world the apostles of disorder, rapine and Anarchy are
</p>
<p>to-day pressing forward their work of ruin, and preaching their gospel
</p>
<p>of disaster to all the nations with a more fiery energy and a better organ-
</p>
<p>ized propaganda than was ever known before. People who imagine that
</p>
<p>the energy of the revolutionists has slackened, or that their determination
</p>
<p>to wreck all the existing systems has grown less bitter, are deceiving them-
</p>
<p>selves. The conspiracy against society is as determined as it ever was,
</p>
<p>and among every nation the spirit of revolt is being galvanized into a
</p>
<p>newer and more dangerous life.
</p>
<p>In Chicago the signs of the times are so plain that he who runs may
</p>
<p>read. The skulking conspirators, who but a few months ago met secretly
</p>
<p>and in fear, in out-of-the-way cellars and thoroughly tiled halls, now court
</p>
<p>publicity. Their meetings are advertised and open any one who chooses
</p>
<p>may attend and they evidently feel a confidence and security which was
</p>
<p>unknown before this year of grace 1889. If this feeling is rampant here
</p>
<p>in Chicago, where the heaviest blow was struck at Anarchy, what must

</p>
<p>it be in other American cities, New York for instance, where the reds
</p>
<p>have a formidable and growing organization, or in Philadelphia, Pitts-
</p>
<p>burg or Cincinnati ? It is manifest that a new era of " revolutionary
</p>
<p>activity " is at hand, and it is to be questioned whether the proper means
</p>
<p>for meeting the proposed attack have been taken, or are being prepared.
</p>
<p>In Europe the same ferment is apparent. In England the conspiracy
</p>
<p>is still largely under cover, for the English proletariat, as the Anarchists
</p>
<p>love to call the raw material of Anarchy, is slow to move and difficult to
</p>
<p>arouse. But the propaganda is busy, and occasional rumblings may be
</p>
<p>heard of the work going on underground, which should be received as
</p>
<p>688 ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
</p>
<p>the danger signals they are. In London there are all the factors for the
</p>
<p>most dangerous mob the world can produce. There are thousands upon
</p>
<p>thousands of half-starved, desperate men, who have absolutely nothing to
</p>
<p>lose save lives which they themselves hold as almost worthless, and
</p>
<p>there is the constant temptation before them of wealth so great and so
</p>
<p>flaunting, and of a wealthy class often so cruelly unjust, that it need never
</p>
<p>be a matter of wonder when the East End of London springs at the throat
</p>
<p>of the West. In England, however, nobody seems to believe that there
</p>
<p>can be such a thing as a servile revolt that might occur among the
</p>
<p>French or the Germans or the Russians, but never in John Bull's island,
</p>
<p>and the conspirators, safely covered by the fancied security of the people,
</p>
<p>are permitted to undermine at their will the fabric of English society.
</p>
<p>In France the Commune is stronger than it ever was, and the Red
</p>
<p>Terror may appear with every turn of the whirligig of politics. France
</p>
<p>does not disbelieve in the danger, but it is practically powerless to avert
</p>
<p>it, owing to the general demoralization which has followed Boulanger's'
</p>
<p>success. Of course, it can only be a wild and bloody riot followed by a
</p>
<p>wild and bloody retribution, by a nation frightened out of freedom back
</p>
<p>into the arms of a strong government, for in France the issues are made
</p>
<p>up, and the country has made up its mind.
</p>
<p>In Spain and Italy, and especially in the smaller states Switzerland,
</p>
<p>Belgium and the Scandinavian countries the Socialists are busy, while
</p>
<p>in Germany and in Russia a crisis is at hand. Thus, the world over, it
</p>
<p>is evident that Anarchy is at work with a feverish purpose never before
</p>
<p>displayed, and the governments are menaced with a danger before which
</p>
<p>foreign war is as nothing. Nothing but the uprooting of the very founda-
</p>
<p>tions and groundwork of our civilization will satisfy these enemies of order.
</p>
<p>Their fight is to the death. They will neither take nor give quarter. It
</p>
<p>is war d Foutrance composition or truce is futile and foolish.
</p>
<p>Are we prepared, or are we even preparing for the shock ?
</p>
<p>Let none mistake either the purpose or the devotion of these fanatics,
</p>
<p>nor their growing strength. This is methodic not a haphazard conspir-
</p>
<p>acy. The ferment in Russia is controlled by the same heads and the same

<p>hands as the activity in Chicago. There is a cold-blooded, calculating
</p>
<p>purpose behind this revolt, manipulating every part of it, the world over,
</p>
<p>to a common and ruinous end. Whether the next demonstration of the Red
</p>
<p>Terror will occur where its disciples are goaded to desperation under despotic
</p>
<p>measures, as in the land of the Czar, or in our own country, where they are
</p>
<p>allowed to preach its bloody doctrines under a broad construction of the
</p>
<p>American constitutional right of free speech, time alone can tell.
</p>
<p>But believe me, Anarchy is not an enemy for society to despise.
