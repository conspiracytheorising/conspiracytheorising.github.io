<p>SAN JUAN AND SECESSION
</p>
<p>N 1853, by act of conoress, that portion of Oregon territory north of
</p>
<p>the Columbia river and north of the 4Gth degree, north latitude, to
</p>
<p>the east of the Columbia river, where that degree crosses said river,
</p>
<p>was set apart and organized, as Washington territory.
</p>
<p>In 1853 the autonomy was organized by Isaac I. Stevens, the first
</p>
<p>governor (an ex-engineer officer of the United States army, highly
</p>
<p>distinguished in the Mexican war), and en route to the Pacific coast
</p>
<p>conducted a railroad survey across the continent, but who resigned
</p>
<p>^y ^y ^'' I to accept the offices of governor and superintendent of Indian affairs
</p>
<p>^^ in Washington territory.
</p>
<p>In 1854 the legislature organized counties and defined their
</p>
<p>boundaries. The Haro archipelago was included in Whatcom county.
</p>
<p>When the assessor went the rounds of his county, he found on San Juan island a
</p>
<p>large Hock of sheep, and assessed them as the property of the Hudson Bay com-
</p>
<p>pany; the chief trader, Mr. Charles John Griffin, notified the assessor that the
</p>
<p>island belonged to (ireat Britain. When the tax collector called to collect the
</p>
<p>taxes, the chief trader ignored him and his credentials, claiming he was on a
</p>
<p>British isle. The sheriff then visited the island to collect delinquent taxes, when
</p>
<p>he Vvas informed that the island belonged to her majesty, the queen of Great
</p>
<p>Britam! Whether the island did or did not belong to the queen was not for him
</p>
<p>to decide; he had come to collect the delinquent taxes, and, not receiving pay, he
</p>
<p>levied on a band of sheep, and sold at public auction some thirty head or more
</p>
<p>to cover the' amount assessed and the costs of collecting.
</p>
<p>James Douglass, the presiding officer of the Hudson Bay company in British
</p>
<p>.America, and the governor of Vancouver island, in May, 1855, protested to the
</p>
<p>governor of Washington territory (Stevens), against such proceedings, assuring
</p>
<p>him that San Juan and all the islands of the Haro archipelago were within his
</p>
<p>jurisdiction and under the protection of the British laws; that he had the orders
</p>
<p>of her majesty's ministers to treat these islands as part of the British dominions;
</p>
<p>all, of course, to little effect.
</p>
<p>He then caused an account to be made out, showing the number of rams and
</p>
<p>ewes seized and sold, and of constructive damages resulting from the removal of
</p>
<p>their rams and loss thereby of Iambs. These he caused to be forwarded to the
</p>
<p>British minister in Washington City, D. C, to present to the secretary of state

</p>
<p>of the United States, and demand indemnity for the past and security for the
</p>
<p>future. These papers were duly presented to Governor Marcy (secretary under
</p>
<p>President Pierce), who, on referring to the treaty to ascertain if San Juan island
</p>
<p>was English soil or not, was confounded by the peculiar wording of the first article
</p>
<p>of the treaty  no channel was named, so the boundary was to follow the middle
</p>
<p>of a channel undetermined. His broad mind recognized at once that San Juan
</p>
<p>island was within "fairly disputed limits." The treaty not having disposed of it,
</p>
<p>the island had not been relieved from the operation of the treaty of 1827, of joint
</p>
<p>occupation.
</p>
<p>On the 14th of July, 1855, Governor Marcy, in that terse English of his, wrote
</p>
<p>to Governor Stevens that "He (the president) has instructed me to say to you
</p>
<p>3
</p>
<p>SAN JUAN AND SECESSION
</p>
<p>tiiat the ollit-ers of the territory should abstain from all acts on disputed (jrounds
</p>
<p>wliic'h are calculated to provoke any conflicts, so far as it can be done without
</p>
<p>implying the concession to the authority of Great Britain of an exclusive right
</p>
<p>ti'. '^r the premises.
</p>
<p>"The title ought to be settled before either jjartj- should exclude the other
</p>
<p>by force, or exercise complete and exclusive sovereign rights within fairly dis-
</p>
<p>jjuted limits. Application will be made to the British government to interpose
</p>
<p>witli the local authorities on the northern borders of our territory to abstain
</p>
<p>trorn like acts of exclusive ownership, with the explicit understanding that any
</p>
<p>forbearance on either side to assert the rights, respectively, shall not be construed
</p>
<p>into any concession to the adverse party.
</p>
<p>"Bj' a conciliatory and moderate course on both sides, it is sincerely hojjed
</p>
<p>that all difl["iculties will be avoided until an adjustment of the boundary line can
</p>
<p>1)0 made in a manner mutually satisfactory. The government of the United
</p>
<p>States will do what it can to have the line established at an early period."
</p>
<p>To understand the sound common sense of Governor Marcj-'s letter, we must
</p>
<p>remember that after Lord Aberdeen had intimated to Mr. McLane, our minister
</p>
<p>m Ix)ndon (May 15, 1840), that he would instruct Mr. Pakenham to ofl'er the
</p>
<p>40th jiarallel to salt water (Birch's bay), then deflect so as to allow England all
</p>
<p>of Vancouver island; that he would probably name the middle of the Canal de
</p>
<p>Haro for the boundary line, we find (May 10, 1846), that Sir John Pelly, governor
</p>
<p>of the Hudson Bay company in London, obtained an interview and effected a
</p>
<p>cliange in his lordship's mind, and, in the project of the treaty, Lord Aberdeen
</p>
<p>aimed at Captain Vancouver's red line (on his, Vancouver's, chart of the Gulf of
</p>
<p>Georgia, used at the time), showing the track of his vessel from Admiralty inlet
</p>
<p>northward, which he found navigable, west of Whidby island, as the boundary
</p>
<p>line he desired. Sir John Pelly wanted that finest of the islands, as he called
</p>
<p>Whidby island, also, but he admitted that he did not see how that could be
</p>
<p>included. Lord Russell to Lord Lyons, December 16, 1859, well says:
</p>
<p>"Had Lord Aberdeen and Sir John Pelly obtained the consent of the United
</p>
<p>States government to their views in favor of the channel marked as navigable
</p>
<p>by Vancouver, or had Mr. jMcLane and Mr. Senator Benton obtained the assent
</p>
<p>of Lord Aberdeen and Mr. Pakenham to their opinion that Haro's strait was the
</p>
<p>channel intended by the treaty, such agreement would have been conclusive. But

</p>
<p>o.?parate interpretations, not communicated to the other party to a treaty, can-
</p>
<p>not be taken as decisive in a disputed question."
</p>
<p>The utmost harmony was re-established between the local governments; the
</p>
<p>United States had sent out, as the boundary commissioner, Archibald Campbell,
</p>
<p>Esq., and Great Britain had sent Captain James Prevost as first commissioner
</p>
<p>ard Captain George H. Richards as assistant commissioner and hydrographer, botli
</p>
<p>of R. N., to determine the water boundary. When General Harney visited Puget
</p>
<p>Sound, Mr. Campbell was located near the 49th parallel, engaged in establishing
</p>
<p>and marking the international boundary line on land; the English commissioners
</p>
<p>iverc engaged in hydrographic surveys. The commissioners had held repeated
</p>
<p>meetings and presented their claims, but the wording of the treaty did not con-
</p>
<p>form to either claim. The English commissioners admitted that they were too
</p>
<p>far to the east, but their surveys discovered a channel for deep sea-going vessels
</p>
<p>just east of San Juan island, which conformed more nearly to the wording of the
</p>
<p>treaty, and they offered to compromise on that. Mr. Campbell insisted the Canal
</p>
<p>4
</p>
<p>S A N JUAN AND SECESSION
</p>
<p>de Haro separated Vancouver's island from the continent, and was the line Mr.
</p>
<p>McLane had assented to, etc. The commissioners had reported to their respective
</p>
<p>governments as far as they had gone, leaving their superiors to resolve the
</p>
<p>boundary problem.
</p>
<p>Another matter (when (ieneral Harney visited the Sound, in 1859), worthy
</p>
<p>of our serious consideration was the unfortunate state of feeling existing through-
</p>
<p>out the quasi United States. We were no longer united. The "irrepressible con-
</p>
<p>flict" had arrayed the North against the South, and bitter strife in congress
</p>
<p>iinluced several states to prepare for a violent separation. We were, at this time,
</p>
<p>in a much more perilous condition than we were in President Polk's term, when
</p>
<p>about to fight England for 54 degrees 40 minutes, and Mexico for Texas. Xow,
</p>
<p>the South, with Texas, was about leady to tight the North, if not allowed to
</p>
<p>secede, and a war with England, then, would, without doubt, have greatly helped
</p>
<p>to secure their independence. General Harney's conduct is inexplicable, unless it
</p>
<p>v\as "'a design and an object with it, the Southern secession from the beginning."
</p>
<p>The historj' of Washington territory confutes the assumptions of the general
</p>
<p>against Governor Douglass and the Hudson Bay company. The evidence, although
</p>
<p>vol connected with the boundary question, is, I think, pertinent to a more thor-
</p>
<p>ough understanding of our relations with our neighbors across the line, who stand
</p>
<p>accused by the general, because it will throw side lights on their actions, which
</p>
<p>are always more reliable than mere accusations.
</p>
<p>It is a part of our history that Governor Stevens, of Washington territory,
</p>
<p>and General Joel Palmer, of Oregon, wei'e appointed commissioners to negotiate
</p>
<p>v,ith Indians for lands appropriated to white settlements by acts of congress.
</p>
<p>These commissioners inaugurated a grand council, at which the Yakima Indians
</p>
<p>(fourteen' tribes), the Nez Perce and the confederate band located on or near the
</p>
<p>Walla Walla (three tribes), all lying on. the east side of the Cascade mountains,
</p>
<p>in Oregon and Washington, were to meet them at their council ground on the
</p>
<p>Walla Walla river. This assembly made it possible for Kamiaken, a very intelli-
</p>
<p>gent chief of the Yakima Indians, to combine all who were unwilling to part with
</p>
<p>th.o homes of their forefathers into a seoet association, pledged to exterminate
</p>
<p>the hated white settlers. The persistent efforts of the commissioners were gaining
</p>
<p>chief by chief, with the possibility that the luiwilling Indians would lose their
</p>
<p>homes. In this extremity it was proposed to massacre the commissioners and

</p>
<p>small guard of soldiers, but Kamiaken advised the disafi'ected chiefs to sign the
</p>
<p>treaty  the whites^ had not conformed to their treaty promises to the Indians on
</p>
<p>the Willamette; it was only to gain time  and it would be a great advantage,
</p>
<p>while the whites considered the Indians friendly, to have time to procure powder
</p>
<p>and lead, and, when winter set in, the Columbia would be frozen over and steamers
</p>
<p>tied up; at the same time the snow on the Cascade mountains would make the
</p>
<p>crossing impracticable; then, at a signal, their warriors would fall, simultaneously,
</p>
<p>upon the unsuspecting whites, which could not fail to destroy them, having no
</p>
<p>escape, and no assistance could reach them in time.
</p>
<p>It was my fortune to sound the tocsin of war, before the winter set in, and
</p>
<p>suddenly Oregon and Washington found a bloody war on their hands. The local
</p>
<p>Indians on Puget Sound, instigated by the Yakima-Klickitats, made a raid on the
</p>
<p>unprotected settlers, massacring the pioneers, their wives and children, and setting
</p>
<p>lire to their dwelling places.
</p>
<p>Although Governor Stevens had applied, early in his administration, to the
</p>
<p>5
</p>
<p>SAN JUAN AND SECESSION
</p>
<p>secretary of war for 1,000 stands of arms and anununition, for any eniergent-y,.
</p>
<p>the secretary declined until tlio militia were enrolled and the allotment deter-
</p>
<p>mined. Hence, our territory was tal<en by surpiise  the governor \\a.s in tlie
</p>
<p>Blackfoot country  the people wholly imprejjared for war.
</p>
<p>Our historian, Judge Elwood Evans, writing of these times, says:
</p>
<p>"In this exigency, (iovernor IMason (acting governor), had been compelled to
</p>
<p>appeal to a foreign government for that aid which our government had neglectef.
</p>
<p>to furnish. * * * to ask of a foreign ofi'icial for arms and ammunition to
</p>
<p>viefcnd Anu'rican homes and firesides. But Sir James Douglass, governor of tlie
</p>
<p>colony of Vancouver island, proved a friend in need. Promptly and generously
</p>
<p>(having nuxde himself personally responsible for the purchases), he embraced the
</p>
<p>oppcrtimitj- to assist his fellow beings in their emergency, and also to impart
</p>
<p>the useful lesson to savagery that, in a war against the white race, they need
</p>
<p>noi e.vpect any sympathy from that great statesman and tlie com])any. over the
</p>
<p>afTairs of which he presided."
</p>
<p>Acting Governor Mason reported the fact of his ajjplying to Governor Douglass
</p>
<p>0 the territorial legislature, and says: "That application was promptly and cor-
</p>
<p>dially responded to to the extent of his power, he, at the same time, regretting
</p>
<p>that he had at the moment no vessels of war at his disposal, and that his steamers,
</p>
<p>the Otter and Beaver, were botli absent, etc." Soon after the Otter was sent over
</p>
<p>to assist, which demonstrated the policy of the Hudson Bay company, to-wit: the
</p>
<p>life of a white person was too sacred for any Indian to raise liis luind against him,
</p>
<p>violently. This occuired in the fall of 1855, and the war lasted several years,
</p>
<p>so these facts should have been fresh in General Harney's memory in 185!).
</p>
<p>In writing an official explanation to the adjutant general, U. S. A., fen- liis
</p>
<p>assumptions on Puget Sound, General Harney, in his letter, August 29, 1859, says:
</p>
<p>"Time and again our lighthouses were attacked, and the wives and children of our
</p>
<p>citizens on that coast were brutally murdered by British Indians. Reports reached
</p>
<p>me that these Indians had been instigated to these acts by the Hudson Bay com-
</p>
<p>pany, in order to drive them (Who? the brutally murdered, or the Hudson Bay
</p>
<p>company?) from the lands, etc." One month and ten days before this, .Tuly 19,
</p>
<p>l'*59, the general wrote to the adjutant general, IT. S. A.: """ * * ^Ir. Hubbs
</p>
<p>i'lformed me that a short time before my arrival, the chief factor of the company
</p>
<p>at Victoria, Mr. Dallas, son-in-law of Governor Douglass, came to the island in

</p>
<p>the British sloop-of-war Satellite, and threatened to take one of the Americans
</p>
<p>by force to Victoria for shooting a pig of the company. The American seized his
</p>
<p>rifle and told Mr. Dallas if any such attempt was made he would kill him on
</p>
<p>the .-pot. The affair then ended. The American offered to pay. etc.
</p>
<p>"To prevent a repetition of this outrage. I have ordered the company at Fort
</p>
<p>Bellingham to be established on San Juan island for the ]n-oteetion of our citizens,
</p>
<p>etc."
</p>
<p>The way we undertake to jjrotect them is jiroclaimed by Captain Pickett,
</p>
<p>Ninth infantry, in his post orders, dated San Juan island, ^^'. T., July 27, 18.59:
</p>
<p>"Par. III.  This being I'nited States territory, no laws other than those of the
</p>
<p>United States, nor courts, except such as are held l)y virtue of said laws, will be
</p>
<p>.ecognized or allowed on this island. By order of ('a])tain Pickett."
</p>
<p>General Harney upheld this order, but did not seem to know that it exercised
</p>
<p>complete and exclusive sovereign rights, for in his letter to the adjutant general,
</p>
<p>U. S A., of August 25, 18.59, he writes:
</p>
<p>G
</p>
<p>HAN JUAN AND SECESSION
</p>
<p>"In a communication to Commissioner Campbell, of the Northwest boundary
</p>
<p>i?uivey, I liave disclaimed any intention of asserting any sovereignty over the island
</p>
<p>of San Juan beyond that which the necessity of the case has demanded."
</p>
<p>This, too, after Mr. Campbell had written to the general that he (Campbell)
</p>
<p>did not think, "under present circumstances, that we (x\mericans) should be jus-
</p>
<p>iified in going to the extent of refusing them (English oflFicers) to land troops
</p>
<p>i'.u' peaceable purposes."
</p>
<p>Two months after the general himself had landed on San Juan island, Paul
</p>
<p>K. Hubbs, jr., deputy inspector for the island, was called on for an afi'idavit. He
</p>
<p>stated, June 4, 1892, that Governor Stevens asked for it, but R. D. Gholson was
</p>
<p>gOAernor at that time. Mr. Hubbs, on oath, deposes that he met the general on
</p>
<p>the island and mentioned "that there had been some trouble between one of the
</p>
<p>American settlers and some of the officers of the Hudson Bay company." Tlie
</p>
<p>ger.eral asked the cause. He said that "a short time since Mr. Cutler, one of our
</p>
<p>citizens, had shot a hog belonging to said company, and immediately went to Mr.
</p>
<p>tiriffin, the superintendent, and offered to pay -for the hog. Mr. Griflfin became
</p>
<p>enraged, etc." "In the afternoon of the same day the Hudson Bay company's
</p>
<p>f^teamer Beaver arrived from Victoria with Mr. Dallas, a director of the Hudson
</p>
<p>Bay company; Dr. Tolmie, a chief factor, and some other parties, who, after hold-
</p>
<p>ing an interview with Mr. Griffin, called on Mr. Cutler and used (Who used?)
</p>
<p>some very threatening language," and other hearsay on dits.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hubbs was, and is still, a great admirer of General Harney.
</p>
<p>His affidavit continues: "They said (as if all spoke at once) that they had
</p>
<p>a posse on board and would take him a prisoner and carry him to Victoria for
</p>
<p>trial I" He was not present, never heard a word, but told the general as a fact.
</p>
<p>This same Mr. Hubbs voluntarily contributed to the Post-Intelligencer of Seattle
</p>
<p>of June 4, 1892, Avhat he saw and knew when the general landed on the 9th of
</p>
<p>July, 18.59, on the island. He stated in the Post-Intelligencer, strangely enough,
</p>
<p>lifter making this affidavit, the following: "Here the general dismissed his stafi'
</p>
<p>officers, and in private communication the arrangements were made which led to
</p>
<p>the occupation of the island by LTnited States troops, and hastened the long-
</p>
<p>delayed question of sovereignty, which took a Jackson or a Harney to consum-
</p>
<p>mate." These private oral communications were to be followed up Avith a prom-
</p>
<p>ised petition, "signed by every American settler on the island."

<p>The promised petition, although dated July 11, 1859, was not received at the
</p>
<p>department headquarters until after Pickett had taken possession of the island,,
</p>
<p>when it was of no other use than to refute General Harney's assertions in his
</p>
<p>letter to the adjutant general, U. S. A., dated August 7, 1859, where he reports as
</p>
<p>follows:
</p>
<p>"On my visit to San -Tuan island, mentioned in that report (July 19, 1859),
</p>
<p>the United States inspector of customs on that island, Mr. Hubbs, made an official
</p>
<p>complaint, on behalf of the American citizens, of the outrages perpetrated upon
</p>
<p>.them by the British authorities of Vancouver island, who are connected with the
</p>
<p>Hudson Bajr company establishment, and who have a sheep farm on the island.
</p>
<p>* * * (Here he repeats his version of 'the pig was shot'  which, by the way,
</p>
<p>was a breeding boar) *  * j ^y^g gigo informed that the Hudson Bay com-
</p>
<p>pany had threatened, at difi'erent times, to send the Northern Indians down upon
</p>
<p>them and drive them from the island. This statement has since been confirmed
</p>
<p>to nie by some of the most reliable citizens on the Sound."
</p>
<p>s AN J r A y A y d s e c k ^' ,s' / o n
</p>
<p>The petition lofened to enunieiates several murders alleged to have been
</p>
<p>uoue by, and they ask protection from, "the bands of_ marauding Nortiiern
</p>
<p>Indians, who infest these waters in kirge numbers and are greatlj' retarding the
</p>
<p>progress of the settlement of this island." Not one word in tire petition praying
</p>
<p>for protection against "the outrages perpetrated upon them by the British authori-
</p>
<p>ties of Vancouver ishind." nor against the Hudson Bay company, but, on the con-
</p>
<p>trary, it says tliat in April, l.s.iS, "the house of the United States inspector of
</p>
<p>customs for this ishuid was attacked and tired into in the nigiit by a party of
</p>
<p>Indians living on this island, and known as C'lailams, and, had it not been for tlie
</p>
<p>timely aid of the Hudson Bay company, tlu' ins])pctor would have fallen a victim
</p>
<p>to tlieir savage designs." Again: ^Ir. A. .1. Dallas, of Victoria. B. C, addressed
</p>
<p>(general Harney, through thcii' minister at Washington City, ]\lay 10, 1800, after
</p>
<p>luiving seen his (Harney's) letters of the 7th, Sth, 2r)th and 2i)tli of August, 18o!t.
</p>
<p>to the adjutant general, V. S. A.; to (Governor Douglass, August fi; to Captain
</p>
<p>Pickett, July 18, and to (ieneral Scott. -July 19, 185!), in which he gives the most
</p>
<p>unqualified contradiction to the part attributed to bim, which he gives cate-
</p>
<p>gorically, by numbers, but which it will take too much of our time to give in full.
</p>
<p>T.et a few sample letters suffice. He says: "4. 1 never visited the island of
</p>
<p>San Juan in any man-of-war. ^ly arrival there was purely accidental. I landed
</p>
<p>from the coni])any's steamer Beaver, used solely for the pinposes of trade, accom-
</p>
<p>panied by two friends. The next day, accompanied, in addition, by (.'hief Trader
</p>
<p>Ciriffin. our agent upon the island, we took the opportunity, in passing Cutler's
</p>
<p>hut or tent, to call upon him. I remonstrated with him in regard to his offense,
</p>
<p>vvhich he admitted, offering to pa,y the value of the animal killed, which was not
</p>
<p>accepted. No demand of one hundred dollars ($100), or any sum of money, was
</p>
<p>made upon him, nor did I threaten to apprehend him or take him to Victoria.
</p>
<p>On the contrary, 1 stated distinctly that I was a private individual and could not
</p>
<p>interfere witli him. 1 have, fortunately, an unimpeachable witness to prove this.
</p>
<p>* * o. Cutler did not use any threats to me, and I gave him no cause
</p>
<p>to do so, etc."
</p>
<p>The published correspondence fails to support any assertion of the general,
</p>
<p>sr.d leaves the reader in doubt as to what was killed. The general says it was
</p>
<p>a "pig;" both Hubs and Cutler call it a "hog," and Cutler adds: "The animal
</p>
<p>was so worthless, he (Oritfin) would never have troubled himself about it"

<p>hence a writer (Mr. Weir) felt justified in pronouncing it one of the "razor-back"

</p>

<p>STATUS OF THE SOUND UNDER COLONEL CASEY, U. S. A.
</p>
<p>In 18.50 the great number of Russian Indians, and from Stickeen river, in tlie
</p>
<p>British possessions, who were prowling in our waters without restraint. l)ecamp
</p>
<p>a terror to the resident families scattered along the shores of our islands and
</p>
<p>mainlands. Lieutenant Colonel Casey, commanding Puget Sound district, located
</p>
<p>Captain Pickett's company. Ninth infantry, near ^^^^atcom, as a rallying point for
</p>
<p>the women and children, in case of an invasion by liostile Indians; also as a
</p>
<p>guard over the outlets about Swinimisli slough (in case Indians had committed
</p>
<p>depredations among our settlements and were tleeing from the Sound), to intercept
</p>
<p>them. Brevet Major Haller's company, Fourtli infantry, was located near Port

</p>
<p>To\M]send, also an asjluni for women and children, and, with a revenue cutter's
</p>
<p>(Jetr Davis) assistance, to guard Admiralty inlet. The locations were well selected
</p>
<p>tor the special objects in view  tliey gave coniidence to the settlers and caused
</p>
<p>the foreign Indians to conduct themselves with greater propriety while within
</p>
<p>possible reach of these companies.
</p>
<p>The Haro archipelago, although subject to joint occupation, had but few, if
</p>
<p>;\ny, settlers then, other than some on Bellevue farm and a United States
</p>
<p>inspector of customs. There was even here an incidental protection, as when
</p>
<p>Inspector Hubbs' house had been fired into, I crossed over to the island with a
</p>
<p>suiall guard to capture the offenders and protect this officer. Mr. (iritfin, who
</p>
<p>had given timely assistance to Mr. Hubbs to escape, was pleased to see the troops,
</p>
<p>knowing their object, and would, no doubt, have welcomed Captain Pickett's com-
</p>
<p>pany had he come, in 1859, simply to protect the American settlements. The
</p>
<p>Clallams saw soldiers land, quit the island for good, and the trouble ended there.
</p>
<p>The old war-rigged steamer Massachusetts, ei^ht 32-pounders, commanded by
</p>
<p>Captain Swartout, U. S. Navy, came into the Sound waters, and, at the request
</p>
<p>icf the governor and Colonel Casey, Captain Swartout undertook to drive the
</p>
<p>Xorthern Indians out of our seas. He found a large number of Russian Indians
</p>
<p>encamped opposite the Port Gamble sawmills, and ordered them to go home, pro-
</p>
<p>posing to tow their canoes for them up north. They refused to go and resolved
</p>
<p>to fight rather than go against their wills; the trouble was brief; they found
</p>
<p>shelter in the woods, when their camp and provisions were burned up. Hunger
</p>
<p>subdued them, and they capitulated after losing a chief and many braves, but
</p>
<p>their losses stirred up the relatives of the dead, who soon appeared on the Sound
</p>
<p>to avenge their deaths.
</p>
<p>This affair cost Colonel Isaac X. Ebey, ex-collector of customs, a prominent
</p>
<p>.!a,wyer and highly respected pioneer  regarded by the Indians a great chief  the
</p>
<p>lo-?? of his head, which they carried back in triumph. How many more suffered is
</p>
<p>not of record, but the tragic death of Colonel Ebey (like the death of the martyr.
</p>
<p>General Canby), convinced our authorities in Washington City that there was a
</p>
<p>quasi war. Thereupon, the navy department turned over the Massachusetts to
</p>
<p>tic quartermaster department, U. S. A., for military dutj'. On arriving at the
</p>
<p>purt of Steilacoom for duty on the Sound, General Harney and his staff. Captains

</p>
<p>chusetts, called at Fort Townsend, for a few moments only, then hastened to Bell-
</p>
<p>irgham bay, where night overtook them. Captains Pleasonton and Ingalls were
</p>
<p>classmates at West Point with Captain Pickett, and stopped over night with him.
</p>
<p>General Harney stopped for the night with Judge Fitzhugh. What occurred this
</p>
<p>night is not of record, but the next day the Massachusetts steamed for Semiahmoo,
</p>
<p>where General Harney became the guest of Mr. Campljell, while his staff officers
</p>
<p>v/ere entertained by Mr. Warren, the secretary to the boimdary commission.
</p>
<p>These officers informed Mr. Warren that General Harney intended to order Cap-
</p>
<p>tain Pickett's company to occupy San Juan island, and he inferred that the gen-
</p>
<p>eiar visit had reference to it. While waiting for his mail at my post (Fort
</p>
<p>Townsend), I showed General Harney's special orders No. 72 to Mr. Campbell,
</p>
<p>v.ho expressed surprise that he, Harney, would order Pickett on San Juan with-
</p>
<p>out advising him (Mr. Campbell), as the island was still in dispute. Mr. Warren
</p>
<p>then told him how he knew it, and had taken it for granted that the general had

<p>GENERAL HARNEY'S STRATEGY.
</p>
<p>However satisfactory Colonel Casey's arrangements proved to the inluil)i1ants,
</p>
<p>thej' were not so to the general, whose strategy is sui generis, and upsets rank
</p>
<p>of officers and disposition of troops, as we will soon discover.
</p>
<p>Captain Pleasonton, acting assistant adjutant general, writes, July 18, IS.)!),
</p>
<p>lioni Fort Vancouver, to Lieutenant Colonel S. Casey, Ninth infantry, command-
</p>
<p>ijig Fort Steilacoom, Piiget Sound:

<p>the Puget Sound district. The communication is addressed to Lieutenant Colonel
</p>
<p>S. Casey, Ninth infantry, commanding Fort Steilacoom  not commanding Puget
</p>
<p>Sound district limiting his authority to his post, literally, placing Captain Pickett
</p>
<p>above him by his having an independent post, but charged with a position of
</p>
<p>gravest responsibility, requiring the highest degree of intelligence, discretion and
</p>
<p>international courtesy, wliich the customs of service intrust only to superior officers.
</p>
<p>The Massachusetts is placed nominally under Colonel Casey's command, but
</p>
<p>actually under Captain Pickett's, because she must rendezvous ordinarily at San
</p>
<p>Juan island, and get her wood and water there, although there was no, wharf nor
</p>
<p>water and no laborers to cut wood at the island, while at the port of Steilacooli)
</p>
<p>tliese were convenient and abundant. But if Captain Pickett wanted Colonel
</p>
<p>{'asey's troops aboard the Massachusetts to join his company ashore on San Juan,
</p>
<p>he has only to say "for defense," and the commander of the company is obliged
</p>
<p>to supply his requisition, even as, in my case, he should rank Captain Pickett and
</p>
<p>differ with him as to the necessity for the soldiers; if he does not comply, he dis-
</p>
<p>oljcys the commanding general's orders and is liable to a general court-martial.
</p>
<p>At the end of every two months the ship will visit Fort Steilacoom to obtain
</p>
<p>supplies and for muster and inspection. The fort being three miles by road from
</p>
<p>salt water, we will presume it is the crew, whether rain or shine, must visit Fort
</p>
<p>Steilacoom, fall into line, there to be mustered and inspected, and thereby save
</p>
<p>Captain Pickett all his trouble and bother of muster rolls. But the queerest thing
</p>
<p>ordered therein is, when you understand that the soldiers are the crew, inasmuch
</p>
<p>as engineers and firemen cannot leave their posts, and the master of the vessel
</p>
<p>is a civilian employe of the quartermaster department, yet the general orders that
</p>
<p>the crew will be instructed, under the direction of the master of the vessel, in
</p>
<p>the use of the cannon." As Northern Indians will -not contest against cannon on
</p>
<p>water, the general must have contemplated a fight with other than Indians, for
</p>
<p>he says plainly he wants "to obtain the most efficient action from all parties in
</p>
<p>cases requiring it." But the unkindest cut of all is in the final part of this won-
</p>
<p>derful letter it is gilt-edged irony  where the -general is pleased to express his
</p>
<p>confidence, etc., in Colonel Casey, and on the same day, passing over Colonel Casey,
</p>
<p>gives Captain Pickett an independent comiuand in the front, as if to induce war,
</p>
<p>charged with: "Second  Another serious and important duty will devolve upon

<p>This duty is to afford adequate protection to the American citizens in their rights

</p>
<p>Scarcely had Captain Pickett quit Fort Bellingham in obedience to special
</p>
<p>orders No. 72, when some eight or ten young Nootsack warriors, painted and fitted
</p>
<p>out for fight, defiantly entered Whatcom, incensed because their chief had been
</p>
<p>(and they supposed was then), imprisoned in the county jail, to demand his re-
</p>
<p>lease. The insolence of one warrior caused a citizen to shoot him, when the others
</p>
<p>avenged his death by shooting the citizen. The town was fully aroused and the
</p>
<p>people took to their arms. When the smoke cleared away four warriors lay dead.
</p>
<p>I was then on the Massachusetts with my company, searching for Northern Indians

<p>around Whateom, but Mr. Campbell and his small working parties in the woods,
</p>
<p>marking a boundary line, from Indian massacres and the effect of Oneral Harney's
</p>
<p>strategy. Had Pickett not been removed, this would not have happened.
</p>
<p>I confess that I cannot see in the general's instructions to Pickett, as far as
</p>
<p>published, any positive injunction against allowing the English authorities to have
</p>
<p>an equal force in "the fairly disputed limits" for the like protection of British
</p>
<p>subjects. Were there any other instructions? Probably none. Mr. Camjibell
</p>
<p>thought and wrote to (ieneral Harney, "under present circvunstances," it was not
</p>
<p>considered projier to refuse to allow the English "to land troops for jieaceable pur-
</p>
<p>poses. 1 found that Captain Pickett had different views, derived frcnn your
</p>
<p>instructions, which he confidentially showed me. 1 ])erceived that they were

<p>susceptible of the interpretation he gave them, tliougii they were not directly
</p>
<p>mandatory on the suliject, etc."' Letter to General Harney of August 14. IS.")!).
</p>
<p>I may be doing injustice, but my candid impression has been that on the night
</p>
<p>spent at Bellingham Bay the matter was orally agreed upon  the hog incident to
</p>
<p>he seized as the pretext, and the exclusion of British law and British troops from
</p>
<p>San Juan island to become the casus belli. We know that General Harney was a
</p>
<p>native of Louisiana; Captain Pickett and -ludge Fitzhugh of Virginia; Faustleroy.
</p>
<p>ths master of the Massachusetts, also a Virginian; and these are signiticant facts.

<p>for Colonel Casey and Major Haller were born north of ^lason and Dixon's line.
</p>
<p>General Harney's indulgence to the citizens in St. l^ouis, ;Mo., who were known to
</p>
<p>be disloyal to the administration, until he was removed; and Pickett and Fitz-
</p>
<p>hugh accepting commissions in the Confederate army, are significant factors con-
</p>
<p>nected with this subject.

<p>had one 6-pounder and five mountain howitzers to contend against over 700 pounds
</p>
<p>of iron balls from a single broadside of 68-pounders, beyond, if necessary, the
</p>
<p>range of our 32-pounders. The revenue cutters Joe Lane and Jeff Davis and the
</p>
<p>lighthouse tender Shubrick, our entire naval force on Puget Round  for the Massa-
</p>
<p>chusetts was disarmed and converted into a beast of biu'den  could make no show
</p>
<p>against her majesty's fleet.
</p>
<p>The iinglish vessels could, of course, have prevented the landing of any troops
</p>
<p>to reinforce Pickett, and Colonel Casey fully expected to meet with resistance in
</p>
<p>attempting to land his command. But it was equally certain to the English officers
</p>
<p>that the troops on the island could not escape, if the admiral wished, by only
</p>
<p>preventing boats landing there to get and carry tBem away. We had violated the
</p>
<p>military maxim: "Never do what the enemy would like you to do!" for we had
</p>
<p>concentrated in a place wliere the enemy could keep us as completely as if we
</p>
<p>had been corked up in a bottle  a la General Butler on the James river.
</p>
<p>With all of General Harney's forces on the island, the English were masters
</p>
<p>of the situation in the department of Oregon. They knew it, and contented them-

<p>selves with keeping a single war vessel in San Juan harbor, with springs on her
</p>
<p>cable to deliver broadsides  a threat far more humiliating than if they had landed,
</p>
<p>because neither Pickett nor Casey had means to force the Tribune to withdraw

<p>from their American harbor, nor from its insulting menace.
</p>
<p>HOW SMALL THINGS TURN TO GOOD ACCOUNT IN WAR.
</p>
<p>It often happens in war that very simple things produce wonderful results.
</p>
<p>At Gaines' Mill, Va., on the second of the seven days' fighting, when General Lee
</p>
<p>had overpowered and exhausted General Fitz John Porter's army and was driving
</p>
<p>him back, General Meagher's Irish brigade was sent forward to reinforce Porter.
</p>
<p>Jlcagher, seeing the masses all around him demoralized and hurrying to the rear,
</p>
<p>divined Porter's distress, and, for fear that his men might also become demoralized,
</p>
<p>he called out: "The left wing has taken Richmond!" The effect was electrical;
</p>
<p>his men rushed forward, hurrahing as loud as they could, which encouraged our

</p>
<p>vpteiaus to liold on. kiiowiuy tluit relief was coming, tieiieral J.ee, iieai'in<j- the
</p>
<p>shouts, Jialle;! liis men to organize and reform to meet the fresh enemy. This gave
</p>
<p>General Porter time to withdraw under the gathering darkness, and saved the
</p>
<p>remnant of his battalions. The timely inspiration of (General Meagher no doubt
</p>
<p>saved the Army of the Potomac from a verj^ serious disaster.
</p>
<p>The burning of the great bridge at \Vrightsville, in York county, I'ennsylvania,
</p>
<p>seemed to have little credit for its important bearing on the war, but defeated
</p>
<p>(ieneral Lee's plan of campaign, without bloodshed, so far as the crossing of the
</p>
<p>Susquehanna river was a part. The bridge was one of Lee's objective points, but
</p>
<p>was set on fire -hme 28, 18(53, just as General Gordon's rebel brigade was approach-
</p>
<p>ing to seize it. three days- before the fighting of Gettjsburg. Lee was approach-
</p>
<p>ing leism-ely. trusting to his having left Hooker's command thoroughly demoralized
</p>
<p>away behind him. His inability to cross the Susquehanna was as much of a sur-
</p>
<p>prise as the proximity of General Meade's army. It enabled Meade to catch up.
</p>
<p>and the battle of (4ettysburg put an end to Jiis invasion.
</p>
<p>But a smaller incident  remote and unconnected with the belligerent operations
</p>
<p>about San Juan island  did, I believe, exercise a potent influence in staying tlie
</p>
<p>contemplated English forcible occupation of the island. I was in tlu^ harbor on
</p>
<p>board the Massachusetts on the mornnig of the day fixed upon by Captain Pickett
</p>
<p>to meet the English officers. Captains Hornby, Prevost and Richards, to decide
</p>
<p>upon joint occupation. Pickett and I had disagreed, and, as I ranked him, he did
</p>
<p>not wish me to be present.
</p>
<p>Before daylight that morning the Plumper arrived, bringing sappers, miners
</p>
<p>and marines, from Eraser river. At a proper hour, Captain Richards (whose ac-
</p>
<p>quaintance I had made at Fort Townsend), made me a social call, and when about
</p>
<p>tc leave expressed a wish to make Colonel Pickett a call and asked if I would
</p>
<p>accompany him and introduce him, to whicli I gladly assented. On leaving
</p>
<p>Pickett's tent, he asked me if he might introduce me to Lieutenant Colonel Moody,
</p>
<p>of Her Majesty's Royal engineers, the lieutenant governor of British Columbia,
</p>
<p>then on the island, at ]\lr. Griff"ift."s, close by. I consented, and on the way I asked
</p>
<p>if it were possible for me to get Colonel Casey a newspaper containing a detailed
</p>
<p>account of the recently fought l^nttle of Solferino, from one of their officers. L
</p>
<p>however, could not recollect the name (Solferino), and it was difficult for me to
</p>
<p>assure Captain Richards, and afterwards Colonel Moody, that it was a later battle

</p>
<p>than Magenta. I learned from Captain Richards that their English mail was more
</p>
<p>than three weeks behind time, and it dawned upon his mind that jjossibly the
</p>
<p>two governments at home might have settled the question and their dispatches on
</p>
<p>the way were delayed by failure of their steamboats to connect.
</p>
<p>After the introduction to Colonel Moody and his staff, conversation was gen-
</p>
<p>eral until Captain Richards announced to Colonel Moody that I brought the news
</p>
<p>cf a later Fi'ench victory, which took the English by surprise, and many questions
</p>
<p>were put to me, which were appropriate to Magenta, and so I informed them.
</p>
<p>Then came an ominous pause, and I stepped into (iriffin's yards for a few minutes.
</p>
<p>On my return, 1 s(xm became conscious that Captain Richards had suggested the
</p>
<p>possibility of a settlement of the boundary question, and their own uncertain po-
</p>
<p>sition was due to delayed mails. They asked how the president communicated
</p>
<p>with his army, etc., how many enlisted men in a company, etc., when I answered
</p>
<p>th.it the normal number of a company was .sixty odd, but the president could
</p>
<p>increase them in a department threatened with hostilities to 100 men, and our
</p>

</p>
<p>coinpanies had not been increased, nor were any defenses being constructed, leav-
</p>
<p>ing us totally unprepared for hostilities. Captain Kiehards' suggestion was to
</p>
<p>them the only explanation which enabled them to comprehend General Harney's
</p>
<p>conduct.*
</p>
<p>At the afternoon meeting the British officers were conservative, and Major
</p>
<p>Hawkins, royal engineers, was soon after dispatched as bearer of dispatches to their
</p>
<p>minister at Washington, D. C. The French war news, I still believe, defeated
</p>
<p>Captain Pickett's and General Harney's expectations, and stayed hostilities suffi-
</p>
<p>ciently long for General Scott to put in an appearance, and he established satis-
</p>
<p>factory relations between the contending governments in regard to San Juan
</p>
<p>island.
</p>
<p>After General Scott returned to Washington City, leaving General Harney once
</p>
<p>more in command, the latter attempted to undo what General Scott had done,
</p>
<p>on the alleged ground that General Scott had left no orders' to grant a joint
</p>
<p>military occupation with British troops; neither has the United States government
</p>
<p>delegated any authority to the lieutenant general to offer or accept such occupa-
</p>
<p>tion, etc. That San Juan island was attached to Whatcom county
</p>
<p>by act of the territorial legislature which was duly submitted to congress
</p>
<p>and has not been disproved; it is, therefore, the law of the land. Pickett must
</p>
<p>respect on the island the civil jurisdiction of Washington territory  "that any
</p>
<p>attempt on the part of the British commander to ignore this right will be followed
</p>
<p>by deplorable results out of his (Harney's) power to prevent or control," etc.
</p>
<p>The garrison at Fort Townsend re-established by General Scott was again
</p>
<p>r.ithdrawn by General Harney. Captain Himt's company. Fourth infantry, was
</p>
<p>relieved from duty on San Juan island and Captain Pickett, reinstated, breaking up
</p>
<p>Fort Bellingham. The general seemed to be playing the bull in the china shop 
</p>
<p>ureaking things up generally!
</p>
<p>General Scott, referring to General Harney's order to Captain Pickett "to
</p>
<p>acknowledge and respect the civil jurisdiction,'! says: "If this does not lead to
</p>
<p>a collision of arms it wilf^igain be due to the forbearance of the British authori-
</p>
<p>ties; for I foimd both Brigadier General Ha^iey and Captain Pickett proud of
</p>
<p>their conquest of the islaj^l and quite jealous of anj' interference therewith on the
</p>
<p>pai't of higher authority," etc.

<p>support for favors performed for the former at Fort Snelling, would no longer
</p>
<p>fa^or him, and on the 8th of June, 1860, directed: "The adjutant general will order
</p>
<p>Brigadier General Harney to repair to Washington City without delay." With
</p>
<p>the departure of General Harney all discord went with him. The island fell to
</p>
<p>us by the decision of Emperor Wilhelm I. of Germany, as ai'bitrator.
</p>
<p>*Major Haller sailed at noon, August 3, 1859, two hours before the meeting
</p>
<p>of the officers was held, having orders to land Lieutenant Shaaff, Fourth infantry,

<p>There are many statements publislied as history of Washington that are

<p>as rel.abe and likely to crystallize into history. One persistently States that D,-
