</p>
<p>A QUEER FISH
</p>
<p>THERE are some queer fish in New York,
</p>
<p>queer human fish that swim and wriggle in
</p>
<p>the great pool of life that spreads from shore
</p>
<p>to shore of Manhattan. They come seldom
</p>
<p>to the surface, and when they do it is only to
</p>
<p>blink and dive beneath again to seek their
</p>
<p>own familiar haunts. They are a school by
</p>
<p>themselves, these queer fish; book- worms,
</p>
<p>savants, inventors, philosophers, so buried in
</p>
<p>their own thoughts and pursuits that they
</p>
<p>neither know nor see how time and progress
</p>
<p>gradually change them, at least in outward
</p>
<p>appearance, into veritable specimens for
</p>
<p>museums.

<p>old Greenwich village, where the dwellings
</p>
<p>2 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>have not yet grown higher than two or three
</p>
<p>stories, and the streets are not yet canoned
</p>
<p>and made straight by the rage for sky-
</p>
<p>scrapers, and the sun still gets through a
</p>
<p>lower window now and then, lived one of
</p>
<p>these queer beings, Winthrop Clavering, the
</p>
<p>author. Such classics as "The Unseen
</p>
<p>Hand," "The Second Floor Front," "The
</p>
<p>Murder of Father Dominick" and scores of
</p>
<p>other thrillers had made his name familiar to
</p>
<p>the public, though he kept himself unseen.
</p>
<p>Living like a hermit, his few wants attended
</p>
<p>to by an old negress Martha, he wrote his
</p>
<p>blood-curdling stories and took his vicarious
</p>
<p>part in the passions and emotional crimes of
</p>
<p>the metropolis. One after the other his tales
</p>
<p>had appeared, at first in paper form, and
</p>
<p>then as the taste of the newspaper public
</p>
<p>needed more and more the stimulation of sen-
</p>
<p>sationalism, finding place in the pages of the
</p>
<p>great dailies ; with such success too that now
</p>
<p>each new instalment of a serial by Winthrop
</p>
<p>Clavering was taken with keener appetite

<p>MARGARET HOLT.
</p>
<p>A QUEER FISH 3
</p>
<p>"All the world loves a lover," and it was
</p>
<p>Winthrop Clavering's observation that "all
</p>
<p>the world is interested in a crook." It was
</p>
<p>the instinct of self-preservation coming out
</p>
<p>in people, he told himself; the instinct in
</p>
<p>most people that made them want to see an-
</p>
<p>other man, even a wrong-doing one, save his
</p>
<p>life and neck and get away as if he were
</p>
<p>themselves. He wove his stories about the
</p>
<p>crimes and misdemeanours of the genus
</p>
<p>crook, and there was always a new kind of
</p>
<p>crook to write about too. He never racked
</p>
<p>his brain to invent an original plot or story;
</p>
<p>he found it in some crime that had been com-
</p>
<p>mitted close at hand, in New York, gener-
</p>
<p>ally one that as yet remained shrouded in
</p>
<p>mystery, though all the circumstances were
</p>
<p>in the news. In such a selection he was sure
</p>
<p>of a popular theme; something that every
</p>
<p>one was talking about ; for, as he told the edi-
</p>
<p>tor of the Telescope, "I always try to get
</p>
<p>my stories up in such a way that people
</p>
<p>won't have to do much thinking. Most of

</p>
<p>them can't think anyway."
</p>
<p>4 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>In the course of time his criminology be-
</p>
<p>came a passion with him. He ate and slept
</p>
<p>with his ideas. The walls of his shabby
</p>
<p>study were covered with X-ray photo-
</p>
<p>graphs of the hands and finger prints
</p>
<p>of criminals. On his book-shelves stood
</p>
<p>a jar containing the brain of a notorious
</p>
<p>law-breaker, his faithful Martha called it
</p>
<p>"pickled brains" which he had got pos-
</p>
<p>session of by great ingenuity and persist-
</p>
<p>ence. It was the brain of a man who had
</p>
<p>murdered his grandmother, he always told
</p>
<p>people, and he considered it a most invalu-
</p>
<p>able relic "in his line."
</p>
<p>No sooner did Winthrop Clavering hear
</p>
<p>of a murder than he hastened hot foot to the
</p>
<p>scene of the crime to go over every detail of
</p>
<p>the affair, and poke his nose into every cor-
</p>
<p>ner and crevice like a hound, sniffing about
</p>
<p>for a fresh scent, his little fox-like eyes
</p>
<p>snapping like electric sparks, as he found
</p>
<p>even the minutest thread of a clue. The re-
</p>
<p>porters and the police came to regard him as

</p>
<p>firemen do the fanatics and enthusiasts who
</p>
<p>A QUEER FISH 5
</p>
<p>run with the engines to the scene of every
</p>
<p>fire, even while they chaffed and sometimes
</p>
<p>hurt him by laughing at his comicality. He
</p>
<p>had the resilience of youth, though he was
</p>
<p>not young, never tiring, never sleeping, his
</p>
<p>brain working nervously with the rapidity
</p>
<p>of a Maxim gun. He considered permission
</p>
<p>from Police Headquarters to make his in-
</p>
<p>vestigations unnecessary, he just pushed in.
</p>
<p>He was looked upon as a joke by some of the
</p>
<p>blue-coats and by others tolerated as one
</p>
<p>who always handed them a laugh; but he
</p>
<p>went on his way unheeding jeers or cheers.
</p>
<p>When he had satisfied himself as to his ob-
</p>
<p>servations on a case, he would return to his
</p>
<p>musty quarters, change his old cape-coat for
</p>
<p>a shiny velvet jacket, don a black skull-cap,
</p>
<p>light his pipe, and pace the room for several
</p>
<p>miles at least before his narrative began to
</p>
<p>flow. Very carefully he would make his
</p>
<p>deductions. At first his practice had been
</p>
<p>to write out all his stories in long hand, but
</p>
<p>as his manuscripts became more and more

</p>
<p>illegible he had been compelled to employ a
</p>
<p>6 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>stenographer to take his dictation from him.
</p>
<p>He generally wore each new one out by the
</p>
<p>end of the first week, what with his long
</p>
<p>hours of work and his peevishness. "Good
</p>
<p>Lord," he would say. "Are you posing as
</p>
<p>the sleeping beauty? A man only requires
</p>
<p>five hours' sleep and an ordinary woman six.
</p>
<p>Only an owl needs eight."
</p>
<p>It was through one of his own stories that
</p>
<p>Clavering became convinced of his especial
</p>
<p>value to the community in the pursuit and
</p>
<p>detection of criminals. He had written a
</p>
<p>story built on the murder of the Catholic
</p>
<p>priest, Father Dominick, who had been
</p>
<p>found lying in a pool of blood at the foot of
</p>
<p>the altar at St. Bridget's Church, in West
</p>
<p>9 Street, in 1893. All efforts of the po-
</p>
<p>lice to solve the mystery had proved futile,
</p>
<p>but Clavering as usual went over all the
</p>
<p>ground, made his observations quietly and
</p>
<p>then published a story, founded on this
</p>
<p>crime, in which he worked out the true solu-
</p>
<p>tion of the gruesome mystery. It was his

</p>
<p>happiest achievement so far, and he was al-
</p>
<p>A QUEER FISH 7
</p>
<p>ways proud of it and of its consequences.
</p>
<p>One day seated in a subway car, he noticed a
</p>
<p>man in front of him reading in the news-
</p>
<p>paper the last instalment of this story, the
</p>
<p>one which described, with much particu-
</p>
<p>larity, the murder of the poor priest, and as
</p>
<p>he watched the man reading he noticed a
</p>
<p>great trembling of his hands and a ghastly
</p>
<p>pallor on his face, and heard finally the mut-
</p>
<p>tered exclamation: "My God, how did he
</p>
<p>know?" When the man hurriedly left the
</p>
<p>car at Forty-second Street Clavering was
</p>
<p>close on his heels. It was the work of a few
</p>
<p>moments to signal an officer and have the
</p>
<p>man arrested on suspicion. His agitation
</p>
<p>was so apparent that he was taken at once
</p>
<p>to headquarters, where he confessed in due
</p>
<p>form. His admission that the main facts
</p>
<p>of the crime were almost identical with those
</p>
<p>described in Clavering's story was a great
</p>
<p>feather in the novelist's cap. Clavering
</p>
<p>himself attached great importance to the
</p>
<p>thing, indeed expected to be officially at-

</p>
<p>result of it then and there ; he saw himself ac-
</p>
<p>claimed the foremost living authority on
</p>
<p>crime and no criminal safe within his juris-
</p>
<p>diction. To his bitter disappointment there
</p>
<p>was no recognition of his work at all from
</p>
<p>headquarters; the blue-coats continued to
</p>
<p>laugh and call him "Little Nemo," as if the
</p>
<p>detection of Father Dominick's assassin had
</p>
<p>been the merest accident or coincidence.
</p>
<p>Then again there was the case of that
</p>
<p>Greek boy, William Saphiro, who was ab-
</p>
<p>ducted. Clavering with his usual zeal, un-
</p>
<p>daunted by continued lack of appreciation
</p>
<p>from those high in authority, formed his own
</p>
<p>theories on this case, too, and going to Cap-
</p>
<p>tain Ryan, in whose precinct the abduction
</p>
<p>had taken place, offered to show him how
</p>
<p>he could run down the abductor.
</p>
<p>Ryan only laughed and said: "The po-
</p>
<p>lice department don't need any wise guys
</p>
<p>like you to teach 'em their trade. Say, get
</p>
<p>this: You keep your nose out of our busi-
</p>
<p>ness! Back to the Nick Carter stuff, for

</p>
<p>yours,"
</p>
<p>A QUEER FISH 9
</p>
<p>Clavering, choking with rage and empha-
</p>
<p>sising each word with a pound of his cane on
</p>
<p>Ryan's desk retorted: "If you'd put a set
</p>
<p>of my books in headquarters and make
</p>
<p>your blue-coats read them, you all might
</p>
<p>learn something about the detection of
</p>
<p>crime."
</p>
<p>And indeed it was not long before his an-
</p>
<p>ger turned to gloating, for when the boy
</p>
<p>Saphiro was found, his abductor, who had
</p>
<p>escaped to Europe, far beyond the reach of
</p>
<p>extradition, was none other than Clavering
</p>
<p>had predicted in his fiction.
</p>
<p>And so in various ways it came about that
</p>
<p>the story teller, less and less appreciated by
</p>

</p>
<p>credible productiveness of his brain never-

<p>theless was gaining vogue in the Evening

</p>
<p>generously for three new serials.

<p>the machinations of the Scarlet Band, as the

</p>
<p>He formed his theory as to a possible cap-

<p>ture of the leaders, but to what end, he asked
</p>
<p>himself. The police would not listen to him ;
</p>
<p>they would only laugh at him : at him, whom
</p>
<p>they refused to recognise as the world's fore-
</p>
<p>most authority on crime. He had half a

<p>mind to make one more attempt, one last ef-

<p>figure, with its squeaky boots and stumping

<p>cane.
</p>
<p>Clavering had seen pictures of Victor
</p>
<p>Holt in the papers and liked his looks.
</p>
<p>"Fools! I'll show them," he muttered.
</p>
<p>"I'll show them a thing or two in the way of
</p>
<p>detecting crime. I'll show them."
</p>
<p>He had mounted the steps of the L road
</p>
<p>at Clinton Place and settled 'back in his
</p>
<p>seat, full of the Scarlet Band, when his
</p>
<p>eyes lighted suddenly on the glaring head-

<p>lines of a newspaper held outspread by
</p>
<p>some one opposite to him.

<p>THE AFFAIR AT THE ROSSAMANO

<p>JACK Ho WELL, reporter, of the New York

<p>Evening Telescope, better known to his as-
</p>
<p>sociates as "Nosey Jack," a sobriquet he had
</p>
<p>won from his abnormal scent for news and

<p>scoops, gave a scornful glance at the assign-

<p>ment book putting him down for a "Sunday

<p>special" on the Settlement Houses of the
</p>
<p>"East-side."
</p>
<p>"Well, wouldn't that make you send flow-
</p>

</p>
<p>thumping the head of Andy Rivers, who oc-
</p>
<p>cupied the desk in front of his, with a gener-
</p>
<p>ous roll of copy paper.
</p>
<p>"What's the matter, Jack?" inquired the

</p>
<p>do a write-up on."
</p>
<p>"Say, he's a nut, isn't he?" said Andy.
</p>
<p>"Oh, no! The World's foremost Au-
</p>
<p>thority on Crime! He and Stealthy Steve.
</p>
<p>Queer old fish! Nearly threw me out of his
</p>
<p>house. I thought before I got away he'd
</p>
<p>have my finger prints taken. He's got some
</p>
<p>ideas, though, growing on his bean-vine,
</p>
<p>don't you forget it. And don't overlook the
</p>
<p>fact either that those spine-vibrating, crime-
</p>
<p>serials of his, have a lot of readers."
</p>
<p>"Pretty raw, that Scarlet Band story he's
</p>
<p>writing now," said Andy, shaking his head.
</p>
<p>"The Blood on the Door Handle! Good
</p>
<p>Nick Carter stuff."
</p>
<p>"Well, believe me, Andy, that Scarlet
</p>
<p>Band does exist," said Jack; "and it's a
</p>
<p>pretty raw bunch, too. I got Clavering to

</p>
<p>"They've been trying to throw a scare in
</p>
<p>to Victor Holt, all right, haven't they?" sug-
</p>
<p>gested Rivers.
</p>
<p>"Yes," replied Howell. "He got one of
</p>
<p>their 'pink notes,' telling him he must be-
</p>
<p>have, or they would 'hand him one.' Billy
</p>
<p>Flynn, one of the Byrnes men who is work-
</p>
<p>ing for the Assistant District Attorney,
</p>
<p>showed me the letter the gang sent to Holt's

<p>office. Prety raw, it was."
</p>
<p>"Is Holt scared?"
</p>
<p>"Not he! He's no piker! But Flyn's
</p>
<p>got a tip that there's a regular conspiracy
</p>
<p>on foot to put the obnoxious A. D. A. far
</p>
<p>from the madding crowd. If they do that
</p>
<p>well, I tell you, Andy, they'll pull down
</p>
<p>this whole blooming town about their ears.
</p>
<p>Every right-minded citizen, every stranger
</p>
<p>within its gates is mad over Holt. The
</p>
<p>man's so incorruptibly honest, so determined

<p>to pursue this gang and smash 'em, that he

<p>There was a touch of winter in the air as
</p>
<p>Howell lit a cigarette, and, with some fur-
</p>
<p>ther grumblings at his assignment, left the
</p>
<p>office to begin his search for his material.
</p>
<p>He figured that the frequenters of the Settle-
</p>
<p>ments would seek the shelter and warmth of
</p>
<p>the Settlement Houses sooner than usual
</p>
<p>after dark, now it was cold, therefore he
</p>
<p>had time to fortify himself, before beginning
</p>
<p>his uncongenial task, by dining at the Cafe
</p>
<p>Rossamano in the Italian quarter, where the
</p>
<p>spaghetti was excellent and the gorgonzola
</p>
<p>and Chianti the best New York afforded at
</p>
<p>the price.

<p>throp Clavering himself. As Jack Howell
</p>
<p>AT THE ROSSAMANO 17
</p>
<p>approached the Rossamano from one direc-
</p>
<p>tion there came from another, at top speed,
</p>
<p>a taxi bearing a young woman. The car
</p>
<p>swayed around a corner and stopped be-
</p>
<p>neath the electric sign, Cafe Rossamano, and
</p>
<p>Jack could see through the open window,
</p>
<p>first that the young woman was pretty,
</p>
<p>second that she was trembling like a leaf.
</p>
<p>She was out of the cab almost before it
</p>
<p>stopped, looking through the lighted win-
</p>
<p>dows of the restaurant, and her eyes caught
</p>
<p>those evidently of a man putting on his coat.
</p>
<p>"Thank God he is safe!" she murmured fer-
</p>
<p>vently, and Jack could hear her. Not dar-
</p>
<p>ing to enter the place, apparently, she waited
</p>
<p>in the shadow of the doorway for some one
</p>
<p>to come out. With her eager gaze fixed on
</p>
<p>the entrance, she did not see three men who
</p>
<p>emerged from a third taxi across the street
</p>
<p>and swiftly and quietly approached the
</p>
<p>Cafe.
</p>
<p>Presently, the young man, he whom the
</p>
<p>girl was evidently seeking, though Jack

</p>
<p>could not descry his face, came through the
</p>
<p>18 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>entrance way. She started towards him,
</p>
<p>impulsively, and called "Victor!" when sud-
</p>
<p>denly a pair of rough hands seized her from
</p>
<p>behind and at the same moment the man
</p>
<p>Victor, so eagerly coming toward her, was
</p>
<p>grabbed and overpowered by two of the trio
</p>
<p>of ruffians deposited by the taxi-cab. The
</p>
<p>whole thing was as swift and instantaneous
</p>
<p>as a motion picture film, and for one moment
</p>
<p>Jack Howell felt like a mere spectator in
</p>
<p>the whole business. The next his sympa-
</p>
<p>thies surged warmly up and he was an actor
</p>
<p>in the drama without ado. The girl was
</p>
<p>pretty and in distress. Jack was young and
</p>
<p>ruddy-blooded, and in spite of his boyishness
</p>
<p>and his air of slang and devil-may-care by
</p>
<p>nature essentially chivalrous. In another
</p>
<p>instant he was in the midst of the affray.
</p>
<p>He had been a witness to the assault, had
</p>
<p>seen the look of appeal in the girl's eyes, and
</p>
<p>he proposed to answer it to some effect. In
</p>
<p>a second he dealt a stiff upper-cut on the
</p>
<p>jaw of the ruffian who held her by the throat.

</p>
<p>It was a hard blow and well directed, and he
</p>
<p>AT THE ROSSAMANO 19
</p>
<p>felt his knuckles crunch most satisfactorily
</p>
<p>as they went home, felling the thug to the
</p>
<p>ground. After all, Jack Howell loved a
</p>
<p>fight.
</p>
<p>The girl, freed from the grasp of her as-
</p>
<p>sailant, tried to reach the man she had come
</p>
<p>for, but a violent push from one of the men
</p>
<p>with whom he was struggling, sent her reel-
</p>
<p>ing against the building, half stunned. The
</p>
<p>man himself was dragged across the street
</p>
<p>and thrust into a cab, the driver of which
</p>
<p>hastened to help the half unconscious victim
</p>
<p>of Howell's blow to join his fellows in it.
</p>
<p>As the cab moved off the girl gave a despair-
</p>
<p>ing cry and started in pursuit, only to see it
</p>
<p>speed away and soon disappear.
</p>
<p>Breathless and exhausted, she was on the
</p>
<p>verge of a collapse ; what should she do oh,
</p>
<p>what could she do now? . . . The words of
</p>
<p>despair were written all too plainly on her
</p>
<p>lovely but now clouded features.
</p>
<p>The cry of a newsboy brought her to her
</p>
<p>senses with a shock, and made her body grow

<p>rigid as his hoarse words reached her ears:
</p>
<p>20 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>"Extry! Extry! All about the murder at
</p>
<p>the Hotel Beaumont." . . .
</p>
<p>As for Jack Howell, when he regained
</p>
<p>consciousness enough to open his eyes and
</p>
<p>look about him, he was lying on the window
</p>
<p>seat at the Cafe Rossamano, with the pro-
</p>
<p>prietor bending anxiously over him. There
</p>
<p>were a few moments of dazed wondering as
</p>
<p>to how he came to be there; then the mists
</p>
<p>cleared and a twinge from his badly bruised
</p>
<p>and swollen hand served as the missing link
</p>
<p>between the present and his past adventure
</p>
<p>on the sidewalk in front of the Cafe.
</p>
<p>He roused himself with a start.
</p>
<p>"Who hit me? Jack Johnson?" he mut-
</p>
<p>tered confusedly; then as his mind steadied
</p>
<p>again he wondered: "Where's the girl?"
</p>
<p>Her eyes had seemed to burn into his so re-
</p>
<p>proachfully. With a mighty effort he got
</p>
<p>to his feet. "Where is she? I must help
</p>
<p>her," he cried excitedly.
</p>
<p>Slowly the events that had followed his

</p>
<p>arrival in front of the Cafe began to fall into
</p>
<p>AT THE ROSSAMANO 21
</p>
<p>line. What had he stumbled into, he won-
</p>
<p>dered. That was more than a mere hold-up
</p>
<p>that he had taken a hand in. Who was the
</p>
<p>man Victor? Ouch! Because of that infer-
</p>
<p>nal thug he had lost the chance of a scoop too
</p>
<p>for his paper!
</p>
<p>He made inquiries of the proprietor, but
</p>
<p>the man merely shrugged his shoulders and
</p>
<p>knew nothing. He had heard a cry, he
</p>
<p>said, and upon going out had found Signer
</p>
<p>Howell lying on the side-walk. That was
</p>
<p>all!
</p>
<p>"Was it all? Not if you're a damned
</p>
<p>liar!" thought Jack; "but I don't know as
</p>
<p>it's the time now to tell you what I think of
</p>
<p>you."
</p>
<p>Well, he had undoubtedly lost a good
</p>
<p>thing, but he must go on with his regular
</p>
<p>work just the same. He lingered over a
</p>
<p>cup of strong coffee after dinner and con-
</p>
<p>sulted the list of Settlement Houses in his
</p>
<p>book. "The Refuge!" That sounded the
</p>
<p>most promising. It suggested atmosphere.

<p>He would do "The Refuge" first,

<p>22 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>As he left the Cafe two newspaper cronies
</p>
<p>hailed him, but he passed them with unseeing
</p>
<p>eyes. "What in thunder can have hap-
</p>
<p>pened to old Jack?" one of them exclaimed.
</p>
<p>"He looked dazed." They turned to look
</p>
<p>ofter the rapidly disappearing figure. "No,
</p>
<p>it can't be that," they thought, "he's walk-
</p>
<p>ing as straight as a parson. He's probably
</p>
<p>struck a scoop."
</p>
<p>Howell made his way along the brilliantly
</p>
<p>lighted streets, through the hurrying, jost-
</p>
<p>ling crowds, his mind reverting always to
</p>
<p>the pretty and sweet-looking girl whom he
</p>
<p>had helped. "What wonderful eyes she
</p>
<p>had!" he thought. "And what a glance of
</p>
<p>gratitude she threw me." What was she
</p>
<p>after, he speculated. Who was the Victor
</p>
<p>she was so eager to get in touch with ? What
</p>
<p>had upset her so, and made her seem so
</p>
<p>stricken and afraid ? He would give a good
</p>
<p>deal to know if he was ever to see that girl
</p>
<p>again, Jack Howell would. She was . . .

</p>
<p>AT THE ROSSAMANO 23
</p>
<p>The cry brought him back with a shock
</p>
<p>from his reveries. A paper was thrust in
</p>
<p>front of him. Mechanically he took it and
</p>
<p>glanced at the head-lines, then thrust the
</p>
<p>thing into his pocket in disgust: "And I
</p>
<p>wasn't at the Beaumont, either," he sighed
</p>
<p>dolefully. "I bet Jimmy Gallagher got

</p>
<p>AT THE REFUGE
</p>
<p>" YlP-I-ADDY-I-AY-AY !"
</p>
<p>The sound came forth in a wail from the
</p>
<p>phonograph provided for the amusement of
</p>
<p>the guests and waifs at The Refuge in Riv-
</p>
<p>ington Street. In the consciously quiet
</p>
<p>room, with its intentionally "refined" sur-
</p>
<p>roundings, the scratchy, dolorous whine con-
</p>
<p>trasted quaintly with the exulting lewdness
</p>
<p>of the selection on the "record."
</p>
<p>Professor Kaufman, sitting at the read-
</p>
<p>ing table over in the alcove, farthest from
</p>
<p>the street, raised his head and frowned sav-
</p>
<p>agely at "the poor man's opera." The pro-
</p>
<p>fessor was a poor man himself ; he was mak-
</p>
<p>ing a few quarters by long, hard work over a
</p>
<p>Spanish translation, and the phonograph an-
</p>
<p>noyed him.

</p>
<p>was busy at her card catalogue, and the
</p>
<p>frown was wasted on her shapely back. Old
</p>
<p>Sam Shipman, the author of the assault on
</p>
<p>the professor's peace, was studying a crucial
</p>
<p>move in a game of checkers with Col.
</p>
<p>Schultz at a little table in front of the open
</p>
<p>fire, while the Colonel dozed blissfully, the
</p>
<p>white bowl of his china pipe resting cosily
</p>
<p>among the folds of his old blue army shirt,
</p>
<p>which, though minus a button or two, strove
</p>
<p>with the spirit of '61 to hem in and confine
</p>
<p>an ample waist.
</p>
<p>Observing that nothing could be accom-
</p>
<p>plished by frowning, the Professor rose, vio-
</p>
<p>lently kicked his chair back and stamped
</p>
<p>over to the phonograph, which presently sub-
</p>
<p>sided with a plaintive bleat in the middle of
</p>
<p>a bar. The Professor stamped back to his
</p>
<p>chair. Mr. Shipman raised his head from
</p>
<p>his scrutiny of a strategic pathway into king
</p>
<p>row, glared at the retiring Professor and
</p>
<p>switched on the music again. He had
</p>
<p>hardly settled himself to study his move

</p>
<p>when the Professor again strangled the con-
</p>
<p>26 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>cert and retired. Mr. Shipman, his grey
</p>
<p>moustache bristling with belligerency, rose
</p>
<p>to hold up his end of the controversy when
</p>
<p>Miss Towne's quiet voice pushed him back
</p>
<p>into his seat.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Shipman, I would not start that
</p>
<p>again if I were you," she said sweetly.
</p>
<p>"All right if you say so," growled the
</p>
<p>music lover, with a final glare at the Pro-
</p>
<p>fessor, meant to convey the information that
</p>
<p>he bowed only to recognised authority. But
</p>
<p>the Professor's red nose was down within an
</p>
<p>inch of his work, and Mr. Shipman found an
</p>
<p>outlet for his feelings by prodding his oppo-
</p>
<p>nent in the ribs with an unnecessary vehe-
</p>
<p>mence.
</p>
<p>"Vot is it?" gasped the German, thus un-
</p>
<p>ceremoniously yanked out of Dreamland.
</p>
<p>"It's your move," growled Mr. Shipman.
</p>
<p>"Huh?" blinked the Colonel.
</p>
<p>"I say it's your move."
</p>
<p>"Ah!" Colonel Schultz took a long pull
</p>
<p>at his pipe, surveyed his opponent's latest

<p>attack and moved accordingly, humming
</p>
<p>AT THE REFUGE 27
</p>
<p>blithely as he saw Mr. Shipman marching
</p>
<p>open-eyed into a trap.
</p>
<p>The Professor's head jerked back and he
</p>
<p>frowned at the checker table again. Colonel
</p>
<p>Schultz hummed on, and, after hissing "Si-
</p>
<p>lence" without effect, the Professor got an-
</p>
<p>other ruling on humming from Miss Towne.
</p>
<p>Thereafter there was peace for a brief
</p>
<p>while and the young lady had leisure to
</p>
<p>answer the telephone.
</p>
<p>The room was a large one typical of an
</p>
<p>East Side settlement. At one side there
</p>
<p>was a large window opening on the street,
</p>
<p>and at the left of that a door that opened into
</p>
<p>a hall which in turn led also to the street.
</p>
<p>... In the back was an alcove with a win-
</p>
<p>dow. Pictures of Lincoln, Washington,
</p>
<p>Mona Lisa and the Roman forum adorned
</p>
<p>the walls. There were bookcases and tables
</p>
<p>and altogether an attempt at home, which
</p>
<p>somehow missed the sure comfort and safety
</p>
<p>of home and became in aspect as well as
</p>
<p>name a "refuge" more than a real home.

<p>Miss Towne sat good-naturedly through it
</p>
<p>28
</p>
<p>all, while the old fellows chaffed and chafed
</p>
<p>and bickered, or asked questions.
</p>
<p>"Is the Evening Telescope there, Miss
</p>
<p>Towne?" demanded Col. Shipman. "I
</p>
<p>want to get to-day's instalment of Win-
</p>
<p>throp Clavering's last thriller. It's called
</p>
<p>'The Blood on the Door Handle.' Are you
</p>
<p>reading it?"
</p>
<p>"I ? Oh dear no !" said Miss Towne, pass-
</p>
<p>ing him the paper.
</p>
<p>"Well, you ought to. It's the best yet.
</p>
<p>It's founded on the disappearance of that
</p>
<p>Reynolds girl about two months ago."
</p>
<p>"Millicent Reynolds?" asked Miss Towne,
</p>
<p>interested.
</p>
<p>"She has never been heard from, has she?"
</p>
<p>"No!" said Shipman, "but I've an idea if
</p>
<p>they'd follow up old Clavering's tip here they
</p>
<p>might find her. He thinks it was the work
</p>
<p>of the Scarlet Band."
</p>
<p>"The Scarlet Band!" queried Miss Towne.
</p>
<p>"I thought the Scarlet Band was a gang of
</p>
<p>forgers !"

<p>"Oh, every thing's grist to their mill,
</p>
<p>AT THE REFUGE 29
</p>
<p>but their chief stunt is this White Slave
</p>
<p>stuff."
</p>
<p>"Good heavens!" cried Miss Towne.
</p>
<p>"Are they too mixed up in the White Slave
</p>
<p>Traffic? I thought . . ."
</p>
<p>"T-r-r-r-r!" went the telephone bell, and
</p>
<p>Miss Towne patiently took down the re-
</p>
<p>ceiver.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Winthrop Clavering?" she repeated.
</p>
<p>And Mr. Shipman turned to listen.
</p>
<p>"He's trying to secure a stenographer
</p>
<p>through our employment bureau. He'll
</p>
<p>be here later," volunteered Miss Towne.
</p>
<p>"Coming here!" cried the Colonel.
</p>
<p>"Well, I'd like to meet him. He's an au-
</p>
<p>thority on crime. Why, I've heard he's run
</p>
<p>down more crooks than all the New York
</p>
<p>police put together."
</p>
<p>"That's not saying much!" put in Kauf-
</p>
<p>man.
</p>
<p>Shipman disregarded this quip, his head
</p>
<p>deep in the paper.
</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha! No Scarlet Band, eh? ...

<p>Kaufman!" he cried. "Listen to this!"
</p>
<p>30 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>Triumphantly he began to read aloud:
</p>
<p>' 'Conspiracy to kill Victor Holt. Assistant
</p>
<p>District Attorney receives threatening let-
</p>
<p>ter from the Scarlet Band. It has just
</p>
<p>been learned that Victor Holt, the As-
</p>
<p>sistant District Attorney, who has been the
</p>
<p>moving spirit in the crusade against the no-
</p>
<p>torious Scarlet Band, recently received a let-
</p>
<p>ter from the Society, threatening him with
</p>
<p>death unless he immediately ceased his
</p>
<p>operations against the organisation.' Non-
</p>
<p>sense, is it? Well, all the same I'd rather be
</p>
<p>right here in our little Refuge, than in Vic-
</p>
<p>tor Holt's shoes if that bunch are after him."
</p>
<p>But Kaufman scoffed, and the argument
</p>
<p>between the two, one for, one against the ex-
</p>
<p>istence of the Scarlet Band, might have
</p>
<p>waxed even beyond the resourceful control
</p>
<p>of Miss Towne, had it not been for the
</p>
<p>abrupt entrance of an unexpected visitor
</p>
<p>a pretty girl, wearing a blue coat and hav-
</p>
<p>ing a big red flower in her hat.

<p>Miss Towne rose patiently to receive her.

<p>CHAPTER IV
</p>
<p>THE BLUE DRESS AND THE RED HAT
</p>
<p>As the great door swung to behind her the
</p>
<p>girl took one step forward and paused, look-
</p>
<p>ing about. This was The Refuge ! To such
</p>
<p>as she the room in which she stood was large
</p>
<p>and homelike. A Franklin grate shed the
</p>
<p>glowing light from its bed of red-gold coals
</p>
<p>upon^a great white cat who lay dozing on
</p>
<p>the rug in front of it and now blinked its
</p>
<p>green, wily eyes at the girl in a knowing way.
</p>
<p>On either side of the long curtained windows
</p>
<p>in the alcove were shelves of green and flow-
</p>
<p>ering plants.
</p>
<p>The whole room and its occupants, in a
</p>
<p>curious way, focussed upon the girl in the
</p>
<p>blue dress and the red hat standing appeal-
</p>
<p>ing and irresolute in the door.

</p>
<p>32 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>As she moved forward, Miss Towne looked
</p>
<p>up from her writing, and noted the girl's
</p>
<p>lagging step and white, strained face.
</p>
<p>"I am the secretary here," she said kindly.
</p>
<p>"Can I help you?"
</p>
<p>The warmth of the tone made the girl's
</p>
<p>overtaxed strength seem almost to give way ;
</p>
<p>walls, tables, chairs, seemed to be joining in
</p>
<p>a mad whirl about her. She clutched at the
</p>
<p>desk for support, and said with an attempt
</p>
<p>at an apologetic smile : "I'm tired. I have
</p>
<p>been walking a long distance."
</p>
<p>"You're faint! Sit down!" the older
</p>
<p>woman urged, and added half aloud:
</p>
<p>"Poor child! Looking for work, I sup-
</p>
<p>pose."
</p>
<p>"I understand that you have rooms.
</p>
<p>Lodgings for women," said the girl faintly.
</p>
<p>"We have. But they are all occupied
</p>
<p>just now. I'm sorry."
</p>
<p>The girl's lips quivered with disappoint-
</p>
<p>ment. "Couldn't you find some place for
</p>
<p>me?" she pleaded. "I am too tired to look

<p>further."
</p>
<p>BLUE DRESS AND RED HAT 33
</p>
<p>"Have you no relatives or friends in the
</p>
<p>city?" queried Miss Towne, solicitously.
</p>
<p>Her clear, questioning eyes were as if sound-
</p>
<p>ing the very depths of the soul, but the girl
</p>
<p>answered haltingly and hesitatingly: "No.
</p>
<p>I have just come from Chicago. I thought
</p>
<p>that I might be able to get work in New
</p>
<p>York."
</p>
<p>"You arrived in the city only to-day?"
</p>
<p>asked Miss Towne.
</p>
<p>"Er Yes." Again the girl stammered.
</p>
<p>Miss Towne looked towards the door
</p>
<p>through which her visitor had entered.
</p>
<p>"Haven't you any luggage?" she asked.
</p>
<p>"Oh, I checked my bag at the station,"
</p>
<p>said the girl.
</p>
<p>"Why did you not go to a hotel?" asked
</p>
<p>the secretary again.
</p>
<p>"Why? Oh, I've been told that the ho-
</p>
<p>tels will not take women who are alone, at
</p>
<p>night."
</p>
<p>"Yes, but you could "

<p>one night?" The girl tried very hard to
</p>
<p>34 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>appeal to the other's sympathy and put
</p>
<p>an end to questioning. She gave a quiver-
</p>
<p>ing sigh of relief as she saw Miss Towne
</p>
<p>take her pen and prepare to write on an in-
</p>
<p>dex card before her. "Did you have em-
</p>
<p>ployment in Chicago?" the secretary asked
</p>
<p>gently.
</p>
<p>"Yes."
</p>
<p>"Of what nature?"
</p>
<p>"I was a stenographer." The answers
</p>
<p>came more glibly now.
</p>
<p>"Why did you leave Chicago?" pursued
</p>
<p>Miss Towne.
</p>
<p>"I wanted to come to New York."
</p>
<p>The secretary dipped her pen into the ink
</p>
<p>again. "What is your name?"
</p>
<p>"My name? My name is Ruth Farley,"
</p>
<p>the girl said and gave a sigh of relief as she
</p>
<p>saw the two words inscribed on a card and
</p>
<p>put in place in the index file.
</p>
<p>"Ruth Farley," repeated Miss Towne
</p>
<p>presently. "And you say that you have
</p>
<p>been employed as a stenographer?"

<p>"Yes."
</p>
<p>BLUE DRESS AND RED HAT 35
</p>
<p>"I may be able to find a position for you,"
</p>
<p>said the secretary encouragingly as she
</p>
<p>handed the pen. "Sign your name here,
</p>
<p>please."
</p>
<p>The girl grasped the pen, desperately
</p>
<p>trying to control the trembling of her fin-
</p>
<p>gers. She gave a little shaky laugh as she
</p>
<p>saw the woman watching her.
</p>
<p>"I am so tired that I can hardly make the
</p>
<p>letters," she apologised. "There," she
</p>
<p>added, as "Ruth Farley" stared back from
</p>
<p>the card. "I think that you will be able to
</p>
<p>read it." Then with pathetic appeal:
</p>
<p>"Are you sure that you won't be able to give
</p>
<p>me a room?"
</p>
<p>"I am afraid not. But "
</p>
<p>Again there came an interruption in the
</p>
<p>ringing of the telephone on her desk.
</p>
<p>"Hello! Yes, this is The Refuge. Who
</p>
<p>is this? Oh, Police Headquarters. What?
</p>
<p>Yes, we have an employment bureau. Yes.
</p>
<p>What is the name? Mary Hadfield?"

</p>
<p>eyes aflame, her whole frame tense; she
</p>
<p>36 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>started to rise, but as she moved she caught
</p>
<p>the eyes of the man who had been reading
</p>
<p>the newspaper fixed upon her. It was only
</p>
<p>because the words "Police Headquarters"
</p>
<p>habitually excited his interest, though
</p>
<p>she did not know that. She sank back
</p>
<p>again in her chair.
</p>
<p>Miss Towne, who had been looking
</p>
<p>through her index cards, took up the receiver
</p>
<p>again. "No," she said. "We've no one on
</p>
<p>our books by that name. You're welcome.
</p>
<p>Good-bye."
</p>
<p>She turned back to the new-comer.
</p>
<p>"How late may I stay here?" the girl in-
</p>
<p>quired eagerly, as though wondering what
</p>
<p>she should do or which way she should turn,
</p>
<p>if she had to move on.
</p>
<p>"Eleven o'clock is our hour for closing,"
</p>
<p>said Miss Towne, touched by the hopeless-
</p>
<p>ness of the girl's face; and she added:
</p>
<p>"Don't worry. We'll try to find some place
</p>
<p>to put you in to-night. Have you had any
</p>
<p>dinner?"

</p>
<p>"Dinner!" The idea seemed a mockerv.
</p>
<p>BLUE DRESS AND RED HAT 37
</p>
<p>What time had she had to think of dinner?
</p>
<p>"No," she replied weakly.
</p>
<p>"Oh, that's what's the matter then," Miss
</p>
<p>Towne exclaimed cheerily. "Something to
</p>
<p>eat and a cup of tea will rest you up. Come
</p>
<p>with me." Tenderly she placed her arm
</p>
<p>across the girl's shoulders.
</p>
<p>As they moved towards the door the dis-
</p>
<p>cordant cry of a newsboy penetrated to the
</p>
<p>peaceful atmosphere of the room, unintelli-
</p>
<p>gible at first, but, as the sound came nearer,
</p>
<p>resolving itself into something like "Beau-
</p>
<p>mont Hotel!"
</p>
<p>The words attracted Miss Towne's atten-
</p>
<p>tion as well as the girl's. She went to the
</p>
<p>window and rapped loudly. "Bring me a
</p>
<p>paper," she called. "Our house physician,
</p>
<p>Dr. Jennings, was called to the Beaumont
</p>
<p>late this afternoon," she explained as she
</p>
<p>made a hasty search in her purse for pennies.
</p>
<p>"I wonder if"
</p>
<p>She was interrupted by the noisy entrance
</p>
<p>of the boy.

<p>38 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>"Sh!" came from the table. "Be quiet!"
</p>
<p>Miss Towne looked towards the indignant
</p>
<p>reader. "You must not expect silence al-
</p>
<p>ways in this room, Professor Kaufman," she
</p>
<p>smiled.
</p>
<p>The man muttered something in reply but
</p>
<p>elicited from the newsboy no more satisfac-
</p>
<p>tory answer than a rough "Aw, chop it!
</p>
<p>Chop it!" emphasised further by a shrill
</p>
<p>blast on his fingers as he passed close to the
</p>
<p>Professor's chair.
</p>
<p>Red head-lines flared on the paper in Miss
</p>
<p>Towne's hand. "MURDER AT THE
</p>
<p>HOTEL BEAUMONT," the secretary
</p>
<p>read aloud. "A woman suspected. James
</p>
<p>Morton"
</p>
<p>"Excuse me," interposed the girl, tremb-
</p>
<p>ling. "Did you say that I should find the
</p>
<p>dining room this way?"
</p>
<p>The words brought Miss Towne back to
</p>
<p>a realisation of her duties. "I beg your
</p>
<p>pardon, my dear, I am most thoughtless.
</p>
<p>I'll go with you at once."

</p>
<p>to the dining room. Shipman, to whom
</p>
<p>murder extras were the elixir of life, seized
</p>
<p>the discarded sheet at once. "Wake up,
</p>
<p>Schultz!" he commanded. "There's been a
</p>
<p>murder!"
</p>
<p>"A murder? Eh! Vat? Here?" ques-
</p>
<p>tioned the Dutchman sleepily.
</p>
<p>"No, no! At the Hotel Beaumont,"
</p>
<p>Shipman explained, pointing to the head-
</p>
<p>lines. "Listen to this, will you?" In great
</p>
<p>excitement he adjusted his glasses and read

<p>aloud
</p>
<p>MURDER AT THE BEAUMONT HOTEL!!
</p>
<p>James Morton, a cutlery merchant, was killed
</p>
<p>by a knife thrust at about five-thirty this after-
</p>
<p>noon, in his rooms at the Hotel Beaumont.
</p>
<p>Shortly before the murder Morton had a caller, a
</p>
<p>woman. The elevator boy declares that she was
</p>
<p>a foreigner, Italian or Spanish. The boy did not
</p>
<p>see the woman leave. Morton had recently taken
</p>

<p>the paper and laid it on the table, "I bet

<p>Winthrop Clavering will make a great story

<p>out of that. Come on, Schultz, let's go

<p>"No, no ; a lecture on Roosevelt's African

</p>
<p>The two men, arm and arm, went out of

<p>the room just as Jack Howell entered it.

<p>He looked back after he had passed them,
</p>
<p>quizzically. "Great Scott!" he ejaculated,

</p>
<p>THERE could have been no greater contrast
</p>
<p>than that between the two wrecked, useless
</p>
<p>lives that had just drifted out of The Refuge
</p>
<p>and the young reporter who entered it.
</p>
<p>Jack Howell's cheery, clean, whole-hearted
</p>
<p>personality made one think of great stretches
</p>
<p>of breezy country, of pluck and valiant deeds
</p>
<p>and achievement. Just now it is true the
</p>
<p>usually clear eyes held a slightly dazed look
</p>
<p>and pain was drawing tiny, fine lines about
</p>
<p>the corners of the firm mouth. However,
</p>
<p>he shook his broad shoulders and by way of
</p>
<p>announcing himself exclaimed in a tone
</p>
<p>audible from one side of the room to the
</p>
<p>other: "Good evening! Everybody!"
</p>
<p>"Sh!" came from the irritable book- worm.
</p>
<p>Jack looked to see whence this curious and
</p>
<p>hospitable greeting came.

</p>
<p>"Did that steam escape from you?" he in-
</p>
<p>quired, locating the Professor as the gener-
</p>
<p>ator of the hiss.
</p>
<p>"Quiet, I must have quiet," came the acid
</p>
<p>rejoinder.
</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon. I didn't know that
</p>
<p>I must soft-pedal."
</p>
<p>Making his voice as "gentle as any suck-
</p>
<p>ing dove" Jack repeated: "Good evening!
</p>
<p>Good evening, everybody." He repeated
</p>
<p>his greeting in a hoarse whisper, as Miss
</p>
<p>Towne entered and took her seat again at
</p>
<p>her desk. "Whom do you wish to see?" she
</p>
<p>asked, addressing Howell.
</p>
<p>"I haven't wished yet," was his rather
</p>
<p>flippant reply, as he turned to take in his
</p>
<p>surroundings. "So they call this The
</p>
<p>Refuge, eh? It looks to me more like the
</p>
<p>Eden Musee," he commented, as his eyes
</p>
<p>lighted on the book-worm who sat like an
</p>
<p>effigy in the alcove. The steadfast and
</p>
<p>haughty expression on the face of the secre-
</p>
<p>tary made him realise that what to him

</p>
<p>earnest. He hastened to repair his error.
</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," he said with a very
</p>
<p>winning smile. "My name is Howell."
</p>
<p>Producing a card to prove it he laid it on
</p>
<p>her desk: "Jack Howell of the Evening
</p>
<p>Telescope., commonly called 'Nosey Jack,'
</p>
<p>not for any racial reason, however. The old
</p>
<p>man sent me down here to do a write-up for
</p>
<p>the Sunday edition. I've had a lot of soft

<p>week I had the Animal Hospital, and spent

<p>He was now getting into his best collo-

<p>quial stride but judged by the passive face
</p>
<p>before him he was not making any particular

</p>
<p>whose bump of humour was a deep cav-
</p>
<p>ity, acknowledged his effort to be enter-
</p>
<p>taining by gathering up a handful of pam-
</p>
<p>phlets from a table and depositing them on
</p>
<p>the desk before him. "Here is an outline

</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't want that kind of junk,"
</p>
<p>cried Jack. And a hasty inspection of the
</p>
<p>material placed at his disposal made him go
</p>
<p>on: "I want to get a flash at the human side
</p>
<p>of your outfit here. It's the heart stuff
</p>
<p>that gets the readers, you know. Funny,
</p>
<p>isn't it, how people like to read about other
</p>
<p>peoples' troubles to forget their own?"
</p>
<p>"You'll find plenty of the 'heart-stuff,' as
</p>
<p>you call it, here," remarked Miss Towne
</p>
<p>dryly.
</p>
<p>"I'd like to nose round for a while, if you
</p>
<p>don't mind," said Jack, "and get some of
</p>
<p>your Refugees to talking; but I don't sup-

</p>
<p>almost apologetically. "Most of our regu-
</p>
<p>lars have gone to the Travel Talk at The
</p>
<p>Peoples' Institute."
</p>
<p>"Just my luck!" ejaculated Howell dole-
</p>
<p>fully. "It's been a rotten day for me any-
</p>
<p>way. How about that old chap, there?" he
</p>
<p>asked, lowering his voice. "Do you suppose
</p>
<p>I could get anything out of him? He looks
</p>
<p>as if he'd had a past."
</p>
<p>"He has. He used to be a professor in
</p>
<p>one of the universities, till drink got the best
</p>
<p>of him."
</p>
<p>"He's a student of Bacchus now, eh?"
</p>
<p>chaffed Howell.
</p>
<p>"He earns a little money now and then by
</p>
<p>making translations for writers like Robert
</p>
<p>Sears and Theodore Calner, or Winthrop

<p>Clavering."
</p>
<p>"Oh, does he? For 'Little Nemo'?

<p>tective stuff in him. I found that out after
</p>
<p>talking with him five minutes, even if I do
</p>
<p>make fun of him."
</p>
<p>"Do you know him well?" questioned
</p>
<p>Miss Towne, referring to a slip of paper on
</p>
<p>her desk.
</p>
<p>"Oh, I run across him at the office, occa-
</p>
<p>sionally. You know my paper prints that
</p>
<p>Tve-got-you-now stuff' of his."
</p>
<p>"Because he has applied to us for a
</p>
<p>stenographer," explained the secretary, "and
</p>
<p>I judged from the conversation I had with
</p>
<p>him over the telephone that he must be a
</p>
<p>difficult person to suit."
</p>
<p>"Well, I should hate to take that stuff
</p>
<p>down from dictation myself," said Jack.
</p>
<p>"Why, before I had worked for him a week
</p>
<p>I'm sure I should be committing one of those

<p>pleasant little murders he writes about. I

<p>everybody who blows in here hands you a

<p>"Oh, of course, and true ones, no doubt,"

<p>replied Miss Towne. "You know this is a
</p>
<p>harbour for disappointed hopes, the last port
</p>
<p>for the derelict."
</p>
<p>"Good!" ejaculated Howell, feeling in his
</p>
<p>pocket for his pencil. "I'm going to steal
</p>
<p>that."
</p>
<p>"I don't understand," said Miss Towne
</p>
<p>blankly.
</p>
<p>"Why! I'm going to use that thing you

<p>just pulled as the leader for my dope.

<p>swollen fingers with a slight groan*

<p>did you do it?"

</p>
<p>"That? Oh, just a little rough-house
</p>
<p>down at the Cafe Rossamano before I came
</p>
<p>here. The usual dope. Beautiful maiden
</p>
<p>in distress. Sir Galahad to the rescue, and
</p>
<p>all that sort of thing. Nice little souvenir,
</p>
<p>isn't it?" he said, gazing at the injured mem-
</p>
<p>ber. "But she was worth it," he continued.
</p>
<p>"The very prettiest thing you ever saw.
</p>
<p>And eyes! You could look into those big
</p>
<p>grey eyes and get a moving picture of Para-

<p>for my breakfast any morning she cares to,
</p>
<p>and put Mrs. John Howell on her visiting
</p>
<p>card to suit her convenience any day."
</p>
<p>His impassioned flow of serio-comic elo-
</p>
<p>quence was interrupted by an indignant
</p>
<p>"Sh" from the Professor.

</p>
<p>cern. "The house physician will be here
</p>
<p>shortly."
</p>
<p>"Yes, and want to cut it off. No, I'm go-

<p>ing to carry that to my grave," he declared.

<p>The entrance of Dr. Christopher, the Su-

<p>perintendent of The Refuge, brought Jack

<p>back to earth and work, and he began his

<p>notes as best he could with the maimed and

<p>aching member.

<p>"Anything new since I went out?" in-

<p>quired Dr. Christopher of his secretary.

<p>"Yes. A young woman looking for a

</p>
<p>BOTH Miss Towne and Dr. Christopher
</p>
<p>looked up with opening eyes at the curious
</p>
<p>figure that presented himself to them in the
</p>
<p>doorway. They were used to strange per-
</p>
<p>sonalities in that retreat of the unfortunate,
</p>
<p>but never before had they met the type of
</p>
<p>human who stood before them now. Old
</p>
<p>grey trousers that were worn thin and flex-
</p>
<p>ible like corduroy, a long knitted muffler, big
</p>
<p>horned spectacles, and long hair just curling
</p>
<p>at the coat collar it was certainly a great
</p>
<p>make-up, thought Jack Howell.
</p>
<p>It was Jack who came to the rescue.
</p>
<p>"Why, see who's here! Talking of the
</p>
<p>Devil! If it isn't 'Little Nemo,'" he
</p>
<p>laughed out.

<p>"Don't call me 'Little Nemo,' " exclaimed
</p>
<p>52 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>the novelist, with an annihilating glance.
</p>
<p>"I tell you I don't like it!"
</p>
<p>"Then send it back and have the cook
</p>
<p>warm it over," pursued Jack, eager to draw
</p>
<p>the quick fire of his nimble-minded adver-
</p>
<p>sary.
</p>
<p>"Oh, I know who you are; you're that
</p>
<p>fresh reporter that called at my house once
</p>
<p>to write me up for your Sunday edition,"
</p>
<p>snorted the author of "The Blood on the
</p>
<p>Door Handle." "And you misrepresented
</p>
<p>me and my work. I've a good mind to sue
</p>
<p>you for calling me 'Old Grape Nuts.' '
</p>
<p>He emphasised the threat by dumping on
</p>
<p>Miss Towne's desk a huge armful of books
</p>
<p>that he carried. Then wheeling upon How-
</p>
<p>ell he continued: "That paper of yours is no
</p>
<p>good anyway."
</p>
<p>"I know. It prints your stuff," answered
</p>
<p>Howell meekly.

<p>"Yes, and it's the only thing that's good
</p>
<p>in the rotten sheet," was the answering vol-

<p>ley. "Some day I hope they'll print your
</p>
<p>53
</p>
<p>obituary, and I'll write it, too, for nothing,
</p>
<p>with pleasure."
</p>
<p>"Those be harsh words, Bertha," mim-
</p>
<p>icked Jack.
</p>
<p>"Don't call me Bertha!" yelled Clavering.
</p>
<p>"Don't call me anything! Don't speak to
</p>
<p>me!" He fairly shrieked the words, pound-
</p>
<p>ing on the floor with his massive cane.
</p>
<p>Dr. Christopher, who had listened pa-
</p>
<p>tiently to this duel of words, now interposed.
</p>
<p>"What can I do for you, Mr. Clavering?"
</p>
<p>"You don't look as if you could do any-
</p>
<p>thing," said the novelist and from this blunt
</p>
<p>summing up of human values, turned his
</p>
<p>search-light gaze again upon Miss Towne.
</p>
<p>"Are you the young woman who wants to
</p>
<p>work for me?" he demanded.
</p>
<p>"No, I am not," was the emphatic reply.
</p>
<p>"Glad of it! Glad of it! You wouldn't
</p>
<p>do at all. No imagination," he retorted.
</p>
<p>Miss Towne wondered what delicate compli-
</p>
<p>ment he would pay next.

<p>"Some one told me over the phone that I

<p>54 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>could get a stenographer here," he went on
</p>
<p>impatiently. "I've got to get some one to
</p>
<p>take my stories from dictation. I don't
</p>
<p>want any of your high-heeled, perfume-
</p>
<p>reeking ladies, who want to come at ten
</p>
<p>o'clock in the morning and leave at a quarter
</p>
<p>to eleven. I want some one who can be on
</p>
<p>the job all the time. Never can tell when
</p>
<p>I'm going to feel inspired. Sometimes it
</p>
<p>comes at three o'clock in the morning and I
</p>
<p>want to dictate then. The girl must live at
</p>
<p>my house, and sometimes she won't get out
</p>
<p>for a week at a time. Can't write 'em my-

<p>self. Bad hand. Bad eyes."
</p>
<p>"Bad boy," chuckled Howell, thinking
</p>
<p>that the author might be too modest to admit
</p>
<p>it.
</p>
<p>"Huh!" grunted Clavering, for once hav-
</p>
<p>ing no reply ready.
</p>
<p>"We have a young woman here with
</p>
<p>whom you may talk," suggested Miss
</p>
<p>Towne, though without the slightest doubt
</p>
<p>as to the outcome of the interview.

</p>
<p>"None of them ever do."
</p>
<p>"How strange!" commented Howell
</p>
<p>musingly.
</p>
<p>Miss Towne rose. "I'll see if Miss
</p>
<p>Brown feels strong enough to talk to you,"
</p>
<p>she said.
</p>
<p>"Strong enough!" snapped the author.
</p>
<p>"Has she been sick? I don't want any ail-

</p>
<p>to an exciting place in my dictation, she'd

<p>"Poor soul! I shouldn't have blamed her

<p>if she'd taken poison," chimed in Howell
</p>
<p>sympathetically.

<p>Miss Towne was leaving the room and

<p>Clavering called after her: "Tell her she'll

</p>
<p>There was no telling what Clavering's
</p>
<p>scathing rejoinder might have been if just
</p>
<p>at that moment they had not been inter-
</p>
<p>rupted by the striking of the clock. Noth-
</p>
<p>ing could have been more curious than the
</p>
<p>effect which this simple sound produced
</p>
<p>upon the noted author. As the last stroke
</p>
<p>died away into silence he suddenly extended
</p>
<p>his long arms, up and down, back and forth,
</p>
<p>round and round, in a fantastic paroxysm,
</p>
<p>to an accompaniment of gasping grunts.
</p>
<p>Jack Howell looked on in mute astonish-
</p>
<p>ment; he had never seen the old fellow like
</p>
<p>this before.

</p>
<p>Howell, getting the stroke now, joined in

<p>the physical pyrotechnics. "Every little

<p>Refreshed by his exercise Clavering

<p>turned upon the unoffending Superintend-

</p>
<p>"That is one of our aims," responded Dr.

</p>
<p>"Well, you're wasting your time,"
</p>
<p>growled Clavering.
</p>
<p>"I'm sorry you think so, but "

<p>"But why should you care what I think?"
</p>
<p>demanded Clavering, eager to start an argu-

</p>
<p>"He doesn't," interposed Howell.

<p>"That's politeness."

<p>with Clavering's almost insulting manner
</p>
<p>and remarks. The latter paid no heed to
</p>
<p>Dr. Christopher's protest, but resumed his
</p>
<p>caustic observations in his same spirit and
</p>
<p>without delay.
</p>
<p>"I've never had any use for churches or
</p>
<p>missions except for local colour in stories,"
</p>
<p>he asserted. "A church makes a fine setting
</p>
<p>for a mystery story. Wrote one once called
</p>
<p>'The Cathedral Mystery.' I had the mur-
</p>
<p>dered man discovered lying on the altar,
</p>
<p>with the green light from a stained glass
</p>
<p>window falling on his face."
</p>
<p>Dr. Christopher made a grimace of dis-
</p>
<p>taste, while Jack Howell exclaimed:
</p>
<p>"Wouldn't that put your hair in pompa-
</p>
<p>dour?"
</p>
<p>"The story was founded on the murder of
</p>
<p>that Catholic priest five years ago," Claver-
</p>
<p>ing went on. "And don't forget," here he

<p>THE STENOGRAPHER 59
</p>
<p>paused a moment for effect, his little eyes
</p>
<p>sparkling with enthusiasm, then suddenly
</p>
<p>drew the reins over his pet hobby. "Mar-
</p>
<p>vellously interesting thing, the pursuit of
</p>
<p>criminals, full of poetry and romance.
</p>
<p>Don't you think so?"
</p>
<p>"No, I don't," flatly rejoined the Super-
</p>
<p>intendent.
</p>
<p>"Then you're a fool," snapped the crim-
</p>
<p>inologist, "and you'd better go to an oculist
</p>
<p>and get your point of view readjusted."
</p>
<p>This was a little more than even the mild
</p>
<p>Dr. Christopher could stand, and he would
</p>
<p>have liked to make a point of showing Clav-

</p>
<p>everything up again.
</p>
<p>"Huh! No mystery in that," Clavering

<p>retorted, "there may be to you, and a lot of

</p>
<p>"What do you think was the motive?"
</p>
<p>asked the Doctor.
</p>
<p>"Ah," ejaculated Clavering, warming up
</p>
<p>to this question. "The motive? That's
</p>
<p>where they all fall down. All except me.
</p>
<p>That's the first thing I get hold of. She
</p>
<p>was there to spy on him, I believe ; to get in-

<p>formation."
</p>
<p>"What makes you think that?" put in
</p>
<p>Jack.
</p>
<p>The question brought a withering look
</p>
<p>from Clavering: "Because I've got a little
</p>
<p>common sense, that's why. Some one had
</p>
<p>tried to pry open the man's desk, and all the

<p>papers in the drawers had been disturbed,

<p>62 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>sagacity. "No, sir," he continued. "That
</p>
<p>woman was his friend, an Italian or a Span-
</p>
<p>iard. No one at the hotel knew what the
</p>
<p>man was. 'A Mr. Morton in the cutlery

<p>English or an American name," he eluci-

<p>dated contemptuously. "Did you ever hear

<p>of an American or an Englishman wearing

</p>
<p>"Earrings?" exclaimed Dr. Christopher

<p>"Yes, earrings! I examined the lobes of

</p>
<p>suppose you are one of those smart Alecks
</p>
<p>who think the Scarlet Band is a myth."
</p>
<p>"Oh, no, I don't," expostulated Jack.
</p>
<p>He had dropped his bantering tone now and
</p>
<p>spoke earnestly. A sneaking respect for
</p>
<p>Clavering's prowess was coming out in
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>"Well, it's not a myth, I can tell you

<p>raps on the cane. "I've written four stories

<p>about the Scarlet Band, all of them founded

<p>"Ha! ha!" he croaked, "If those fellows got

<p>"And this murder at the Beaumont then,"
</p>
<p>reminded Dr. Christopher, to whom the
</p>
<p>criminologist's views on the murder were
</p>
<p>more interesting than his insinuations as to
</p>
<p>the District Attorney's office. "Why did
</p>
<p>the stenographer have to kill the man?
</p>
<p>Wasn't that taking pretty big chances just
</p>
<p>to get a bit of information?"
</p>
<p>This question Clavering apparently
</p>
<p>weighed a moment in his mind before he an-
</p>
<p>swered. "I don't think she intended to kill
</p>
<p>him," he said. "She stabbed him with one
</p>
<p>of his own sample knives. That shows that

<p>she didn't go there ready armed."

<p>"That's interesting," responded Jack.

<p>that afternoon Morton called up the Cafe

<p>Rossamano on his private wire in great

<p>said, and the receiver fell."

<p>"Cafe Rossamano!" put in Jack Howell.

<p>"Why! I"

<p>"Why! What?" demanded Clavering,

<p>scenting some criticism in the interruption.
</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing, nothing," replied Jack, try-
</p>
<p>ing to look as if the words Cafe Rossamano
</p>
<p>conveyed no meaning to him after all.
</p>
<p>"Well," retorted the author testily, "the
</p>
<p>man who interrupts with 'nothing' is a hell
</p>
<p>of an addition to an argument."
</p>
<p>Dr. Christopher, fearing renewed hostili-

<p>ties and fascinated by the novelist's line of

<p>deduction, broke in again and urged: "Go

<p>tragedy at the Beaumont be linked in any

<p>way with his own strange encounter in front

<p>70 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>the Rossamano! The girl with the eyes!
</p>
<p>What the deuce is she doing here, and in such
</p>
<p>a state of excitement too?"
</p>
<p>Half instinctively, more in the spirit of
</p>
<p>not wishing to interrupt than of eaves-
</p>
<p>dropping, he drew back and waited, listen-
</p>
<p>ing. The girl held her face very close to
</p>
<p>the receiver and spoke in a low, hurried tone.
</p>
<p>"Give me six-eight-seven Chelsea.
</p>
<p>Hurry, please!" -she breathed tensely to the
</p>
<p>unseen Central. All the time she kept
</p>
<p>glancing toward the doors, in most palpable
</p>
<p>suspense. At last the answer.
</p>
<p>"Is that you, Uncle Mark? Quick,
</p>
<p>listen! This is Margaret. Has Victor
</p>
<p>come home yet? Oh, no word from him?"
</p>
<p>Jack could hear her almost sobbing.
</p>
<p>Her ear was so close to the transmitter
</p>
<p>that she could not hear the slight squeak of a
</p>
<p>board beneath his foot and still Jack listened.
</p>
<p>His impulse was to advance with assurance
</p>
<p>and claim acquaintance with her, but at her
</p>
<p>next words, uttered in an agonised tone, he

<p>paused again.
</p>
<p>THE STENOGRAPHER 71
</p>
<p>"There is? Forme? With the red band?
</p>
<p>My God! How did it come? By messen-
</p>
<p>ger? Bring it to me at once. The Refuge,
</p>
<p>16 Irvington Street. Come yourself and be
</p>
<p>careful ! Have you seen the Evening Tele-
</p>
<p>scope? Yes. It's true. I can't explain.
</p>
<p>I"
</p>
<p>Then at last she seemed to sense a pres-
</p>
<p>ence in the room and stopped abruptly,
</p>
<p>hanging up the transmitter with a trembling
</p>
<p>hand, not daring to look around.
</p>
<p>Howell saw a tell-tale crimson flame over
</p>
<p>the pallid face, heard her tense breathing as
</p>
<p>she hastily seized a pencil and made a pre-
</p>
<p>tence at writing. He even thought he
</p>
<p>caught the quivering of her eyelids. Poor
</p>
<p>thing !
</p>
<p>Who was she? What was the trouble?
</p>
<p>A suspicion that had been forming in his
</p>
<p>brain while she was at the telephone, flared
</p>
<p>now to conviction. Was she Mary Had-
</p>
<p>field, the girl wanted for the murder of Mor-

<p>girl? Then the instincts of the reporter
</p>
<p>72 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>who scents a scoop seized him for a mo-

<p>ment, despite his sympathy. What a
</p>
<p>chance! If she were the murderess and he
</p>
<p>should be the first to detect her What a
</p>
<p>scoop !
</p>
<p>He advanced a step or two toward her
</p>
<p>"Well?" he said, looking fixedly at her,
</p>
<p>The girl raised her head and gave him
</p>
<p>back the look bravely. No sound came from
</p>
<p>her dry lips. Her face was as white as the
</p>
<p>paper on the desk before her, but no fear
</p>
<p>showed in her eyes, and there was no tremor
</p>
<p>or trembling in any feature.
</p>
<p>"Well?" said Jack again nonchalantly.

<p>CHAPTER VII
</p>
<p>A NEW CONSPIRATOR
</p>
<p>"WHO are you?" asked the girl presently,
</p>
<p>in a tone of such composure that it brought
</p>
<p>a smile to the reporter's lips in spite of him-
</p>
<p>self.
</p>
<p>"She's a cool one anyway," Jack thought.
</p>
<p>Advancing a step nearer to her he answered :
</p>
<p>"I don't know yet. But I think I think
</p>
<p>I'm your friend. I'm not sure though."
</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" she demanded.
</p>
<p>Howell paused a moment, then said
</p>
<p>significantly: "You'd better tell me all
</p>
<p>about it, don't you think, if I'm to be your
</p>
<p>friend?"
</p>
<p>With an almost imperceptible start the
</p>
<p>girl turned to the papers on the desk again,
</p>
<p>as if to sort them out and turn the subject.
</p>
<p>"I really don't know what you are talking
</p>
<p>about," she said. There was even a tinge of

</p>
<p>amused tolerance in the tone that she
</p>
<p>achieved.
</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, you do," went on the relentless
</p>
<p>Jack. His pride was pricked by that last
</p>
<p>cool parry ; he would break down her guard.
</p>
<p>Lowering his voice he took a sudden resolu-
</p>
<p>tion, and lunged the accusation: "You
</p>
<p>killed that man at the Hotel Beaumont,
</p>
<p>didn't you?" He watched the effect of his
</p>
<p>thrust narrowly. The uncontrollable look
</p>
<p>of terror that for an instant made ghastly
</p>
<p>the already pale face, made him wince de-
</p>
<p>spite himself.
</p>
<p>"It's not true," came the hoarse denial.
</p>
<p>"I have just come here from Chicago."
</p>
<p>"Oh, no, you haven't !" began Jack.
</p>
<p>"I tell you I have," countered the girl,
</p>
<p>struggling vainly to give conviction to her
</p>
<p>words.
</p>
<p>Howell took a copy of the Evening Tele-
</p>
<p>scope from his pocket and rattled it osten-
</p>
<p>tatiously. "What was it that you told your
</p>
<p>Uncle was true in the Telescope?" he de-

<p>manded.
</p>
<p>A NEW CONSPIRATOR 75
</p>
<p>She shrank back at that, then made a des-
</p>
<p>perate effort for control. "I was talking
</p>
<p>about something quite personal," she pro-
</p>
<p>tested weakly.
</p>
<p>"Oh, no, you weren't. You were talking
</p>
<p>about this." He thrust the paper with its
</p>
<p>accusing murder head-lines before her
</p>
<p>startled eyes and watched her.
</p>
<p>"I'll not endure your insults any longer!"
</p>
<p>the girl retorted, regaining her poise with an
</p>
<p>incredible effort, in spite of her terror and
</p>
<p>anguish of spirit. She rose with imperious
</p>
<p>dignity and made as if to leave the room.
</p>
<p>"Wait!" called Jack. His tone was
</p>
<p>softened now. What a valiant soul she was,
</p>
<p>he thought, after all. Why should she be
</p>
<p>in peril from him? Was it his business to
</p>
<p>hunt her down, to pursue a defenceless girl
</p>
<p>because she was at his mercy before he really
</p>
<p>knew her story? She was no ordinary
</p>
<p>criminal, he could see. Why had she com-
</p>
<p>mitted murder, if she had committed it? It
</p>
<p>was his business to find out that before he

<p>sentenced her.
</p>
<p>76 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>He changed his tactics, and said gently:
</p>
<p>"See here. I've got a hunch that you're in
</p>
<p>wrong. Of course you may question my
</p>
<p>right to talk to you as I do, but you know I'm
</p>
<p>not quite a stranger, am I? We've met be-
</p>
<p>fore, I think. Don't you remember?"
</p>
<p>She did remember, he could see, but would
</p>
<p>not say so; perhaps this friendliness on his
</p>
<p>part was but another attempt to trap her
</p>
<p>into a confession, she might think. She
</p>
<p>must be careful.
</p>
<p>"No," she replied, again looking directly
</p>
<p>into his eyes; "I have never seen you be-
</p>
<p>fore."
</p>
<p>"No?" smiled Jack. "Well, perhaps my
</p>
<p>face isn't one to get matineed on ; but as for
</p>
<p>me I've got a memorandum of our meeting
</p>
<p>in this nice little bunch of forget-me-nots
</p>
<p>here." He drew his bruised and swollen
</p>
<p>hand from his pocket and held it out for in-
</p>
<p>spection.
</p>
<p>"Oh !" She gave a little crooning cry,
</p>
<p>but again she checked herself.

</p>
<p>and remorse blended, a sound that could
</p>
<p>only be the utterance of a gentle heart, a
</p>
<p>great wave of emotion flooded Jack's frame
</p>
<p>and brain. It was impossible that a girl
</p>
<p>who looked with such compassion upon an
</p>
<p>injured hand could kill a man in cold blood!
</p>
<p>No, no, his brain protested; she must have
</p>
<p>been justified in some way! There must
</p>
<p>have been some awful provocation! His
</p>
<p>man's heart took up arms in her defence
</p>
<p>outright. How could he help her? But
</p>
<p>first he must gain her confidence.
</p>
<p>"Come on," he said, with kindly insist-
</p>
<p>ence. "Tell me everything."
</p>
<p>She turned to him, her grey eyes question-
</p>
<p>ing his as though to read his very soul, and
</p>
<p>her lips parted. But before she could utter
</p>
<p>a word the bang of the outer door sounded
</p>
<p>interruption. Instantly the hunted look
</p>
<p>was on her face again. In an instant too
</p>
<p>she and Jack were allies together against a
</p>
<p>common danger.
</p>
<p>"Get busy!" commanded Howell in an

</p>
<p>78 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>-
</p>
<p>The note of warning in his voice made her
</p>
<p>return to the chair at the desk, blindly obey-
</p>
<p>ing him, she knew not why. The outer door
</p>
<p>of the room opened, but she dared not look
</p>
<p>to see who entered.
</p>
<p>Howell, meanwhile, seated at the opposite
</p>
<p>side of the room, saw reflected in the mirror
</p>
<p>before him the burly form of a police offi-
</p>
<p>cer framed in the doorway. He caught his
</p>
<p>breath. So soon! What was the man's er-
</p>
<p>rand! Had he come already to arrest this
</p>
<p>poor girl? Well, if he had, he shouldn't
</p>
<p>get her. She was his! His prize! Fate
</p>
<p>hadn't sent him first to the Cafe Rossamano,
</p>
<p>then here, for nothing. She was his. His
</p>
<p>mind was clear as to the issue. He had
</p>
<p>been sent to stand between this girl and
</p>
<p>ruin. "And by Heaven I'll do it!" he swore
</p>
<p>passionately.
</p>
<p>With these thoughts surging through his
</p>
<p>mind, he greeted the officer. "Hello, Cap-
</p>
<p>tain Ryan," he called in a loud, affable tone,

<p>emphasising the new-comer's rank to pre-

</p>
<p>pare his companion for what might be com-
</p>
<p>ing next.
</p>
<p>"Hello, Howell!" gruffly responded the
</p>
<p>officer, in whose precinct this latest murder
</p>
<p>had been committed ; and who did not like it.
</p>
<p>"What are you doing here?"
</p>
<p>"Oh, getting some dope for a Sunday
</p>
<p>special, and missing all the good things,"
</p>
<p>answered Howell disgustedly. By giving
</p>
<p>special emphasis to "missing all the good
</p>
<p>things," he was hoping to get some inkling
</p>
<p>of Ryan's errand, and start communica-
</p>
<p>tions.
</p>
<p>"Well, you missed a good thing this after-
</p>
<p>noon, all right," said the wearer of the blue
</p>
<p>coat, taking the bait in a tone of satisfaction.
</p>
<p>He didn't always like reporters; they were
</p>
<p>always butting in, he said; but he tolerated
</p>
<p>this one because, as he told Howell, "he
</p>
<p>liked his comedy."
</p>
<p>"Got any new dope yet on that Beaumont
</p>
<p>murder, Captain?" inquired Jack in a casual

</p>
<p>80 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>"No. But I'll have some soon. Who's
</p>
<p>in charge here?"
</p>
<p>As he asked this question the white cat,
</p>
<p>which had been roaming about the room in a
</p>
<p>disturbed, restless fashion, approached Mar-
</p>
<p>garet, and rubbing against her skirt, gave a
</p>
<p>spring and landed on the desk in front of
</p>
<p>her, settling on its haunches and gazing with
</p>
<p>its emerald and sphinx-like eyes upon the
</p>
<p>officer of the law. With a sudden fright-
</p>
<p>ened longing for warmth and comfort, the
</p>
<p>girl put her hand softly on the animal's
</p>
<p>back and stroked it. A prodigious yawn
</p>
<p>was the only recognition the cat made of her
</p>
<p>touch ; then it settled back again to its steady
</p>
<p>gaze at Ryan.
</p>
<p>"Who's in charge here?" he repeated, and
</p>
<p>nodded his head in the direction of the girl
</p>
<p>at the desk. "That young lady the bureau
</p>
<p>of information?"
</p>
<p>Surprised at this sudden turn of affairs,
</p>
<p>Margaret was nevertheless quick to see the

<p>solution it might hold for her. She glanced
</p>
<p>A NEW CONSPIRATOR 81
</p>
<p>toward Howell, who, standing behind the
</p>
<p>officer, gave her an encouraging nod.
</p>
<p>"Yes," she replied sweetly. "What can
</p>
<p>I do for you?"
</p>
<p>"How long have you been on duty?" de-
</p>
<p>manded Ryan sharply.
</p>
<p>"She was here when I came in at about
</p>
<p>four-thirty," put in Howell quickly.
</p>
<p>"Four-thirty?" repeated the officer.
</p>
<p>Margaret had taken her cue.
</p>
<p>"Yes," she answered promptly, "I think
</p>
<p>it was just about four-thirty."
</p>
<p>"Was it you who answered the phone
</p>
<p>when they called up from Headquarters a
</p>
<p>while ago?"
</p>
<p>"Yes."
</p>
<p>Howell watched the girl breathlessly,
</p>
<p>ready with a signal if she needed it. With
</p>
<p>ti
</p>
<p>a wisdom born of fear she avoided answer-
</p>
<p>ing him with her eyes.
</p>
<p>"Any one entering from the street would
</p>
<p>be seen by you?"
</p>
<p>"Yes, Captain." She answered now

<p>without hesitation.
</p>
<p>82 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>Howell's clenched hands relaxed. "Great
</p>
<p>Scott! But she's a corker!" he thought fer-
</p>
<p>vently.
</p>
<p>"You told Headquarters over the phone
</p>
<p>that you had never placed from your em-
</p>
<p>ployment bureau a stenographer by the
</p>
<p>name of Mary Hadfield?"
</p>
<p>"No, we have no such name on our list."
</p>
<p>"Sure?" demanded Ryan in his most in-
</p>
<p>quisitorial tone.
</p>
<p>"I am positive," was the decided answer.
</p>
<p>"Well, if a woman who looks at all sus-
</p>
<p>picious should come in here to-night, detain
</p>
<p>her and notify me at once. I can't give you
</p>
<p>a description of her, because she'd only been
</p>
<p>in Morton's employ a few days, and those
</p>
<p>boneheads at the Beaumont don't seem to
</p>
<p>know what the skirt looked like. But we
</p>
<p>want her, and we'll get her if I myself have
</p>
<p>to investigate every employment bureau in
</p>
<p>New York City. So long, Howell."

<p>He turned away and Margaret gave a

<p>moment from the relentless look he had fixed
</p>
<p>A NEW CONSPIRATOR 83
</p>
<p>on her during his colloquy. Then she grew
</p>
<p>rigid again as she heard the young man ask-
</p>
<p>ing Captain Ryan: "Oh, it's the stenogra-
</p>
<p>pher you're looking for, is it? Do you think
</p>
<p>she's the one who killed Morton?"
</p>
<p>"Naw," replied the Captain, disgusted
</p>
<p>with the supposition. "The woman who
</p>
<p>killed Morton is the Spanish dame that
</p>
<p>called on him about four o'clock."
</p>
<p>"Oh, that's the idea, is it?" exclaimed
</p>
<p>Howell, as if tremendously impressed.
</p>
<p>"Why, sure," continued Ryan patronis-
</p>
<p>ingly. "It's the old jealousy stuff. But
</p>
<p>if the stenographer was there when she
</p>
<p>called, she can give us a description of the
</p>
<p>foreigner, can't she?"
</p>
<p>"Oh, I see. Of course you're anxious to
</p>
<p>find her, yes. Well, I hope you get her,"
</p>
<p>said Howell heartily.
</p>
<p>"Oh, we'll get her all right," retorted the
</p>
<p>Captain, adding with a half sneer of vindi-
</p>
<p>cation, "The Police Department ain't as rot-

</p>
<p>84 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>"Oh, I say!" expostulated Howell, as a
</p>
<p>loyal member of the maligned press.
</p>
<p>"You say! do you?" sneered Ryan.
</p>
<p>"Every newspaper in town is panning us,"
</p>
<p>he added with a snarl. "That nut, Victor
</p>
<p>Holt, started it. Everything was all right
</p>
<p>till he butted in. To hear Holt talk you'd
</p>
<p>think there wasn't an honest policeman in

<p>New York."
</p>
<p>"Well," said Howell, who was in sympa-

<p>thy with the Assistant District Attorney, "is

<p>"There you go!" angrily retorted Ryan,

<p>and then went on in a querulous tone.
</p>
<p>"Now what chance have we got, with every

<p>Holt. He got sore because every man in

<p>We've got a few other things to attend to

</p>
<p>Howell, while seeking information, was not
</p>
<p>innocent of the intention of getting back at
</p>
<p>the Department for its malice and disloyalty
</p>
<p>to Holt, whom he admired.
</p>
<p>"Yes, he took on the Byrnes men," as-
</p>
<p>sented Ryan, then added with a chuckle of
</p>
<p>contempt, "and a hell of a lot of good they'll
</p>
<p>do him. Did you see in the paper where
</p>
<p>Holt got a letter from that Scarlet Band

<p>bunch?"
</p>
<p>"Yes, I saw that."
</p>
<p>"Well, I hope they get him. Serve him
</p>
<p>right!" muttered the officer vindictively, as
</p>
<p>he started to leave the room.
</p>
<p>A determination to keep in touch with any
</p>
<p>information the Captain might acquire con-
</p>
<p>cerning the Beaumont affair, prompted Jack
</p>
<p>to speak again.
</p>
<p>"Oh, by the way, Captain," he suggested,
</p>
<p>"you know, as I was down here refuging, I
</p>
<p>wasn't in on this murder story. If you get

<p>86 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>Ryan saw the bill, but drew up his six feet
</p>
<p>with dignity and glared at the insult to his
</p>
<p>uniform. "What do you take me for?" he
</p>
<p>demanded, mortally offended. "We cut all
</p>
<p>that out long ago, you know that. Nothing
</p>
<p>doing!"
</p>
<p>"Oh, no offence," said Howell apologetic-
</p>
<p>ally, and rather deliberately dropped the bill
</p>
<p>on the carpet.
</p>
<p>Ryan turned to Margaret with a parting
</p>
<p>injunction. "Don't forget what I told you,
</p>
<p>Miss, if anything new turns up let me
</p>
<p>know. Good-night!"
</p>
<p>On his way to the door his eye fell upon
</p>
<p>the money. "Hello!" he called, as he
</p>
<p>stooped and picked up the seductive yellow-
</p>
<p>back. "Some one's dropped a bill here. Is
</p>
<p>it yours?" he asked, turning to Margaret.
</p>
<p>The girl shook her head. "Yours?" he
</p>
<p>asked, giving the reporter a quizzical stare.
</p>
<p>"Oh, no, no," the latter answered with a
</p>
<p>look at the officer which suggested the doc-
</p>
<p>trine of losers seekers, finders keepers.

<p>Ryan was not slow to catch its import.

</p>
<p>"Why, I must have dropped it myself when
</p>
<p>I came in," he said and slipped the bill into
</p>
<p>his pocket.
</p>
<p>"Good-night!"
</p>
<p>From the window Howell watched the
</p>
<p>Captain's figure out of sight. Then he
</p>
<p>turned to Margaret again. She had risen,
</p>
<p>and seemed wholly unconscious of her com-
</p>
<p>panion's scrutiny, as if rapidly reviewing the
</p>
<p>events of the last few minutes.
</p>
<p>"Well," she said at last bitterly, "if you
</p>
<p>learn' that stenographer's story, you will
</p>
<p>have your scoop, won't you?"
</p>
<p>In reply Jack only fixed his eyes upon her
</p>
<p>with an approving smile. "Well, you got
</p>
<p>away with it! It was immense. You
</p>
<p>never turned a hair," he said exultingly.
</p>
<p>"I wish you would go away and let me go
</p>
<p>on by myself," replied Margaret anxiously.
</p>
<p>"Oh, that isn't the next thing," said Jack
</p>
<p>emphatically. "You know you are waiting

<p>here for something that your Uncle is to

</p>
<p>"Tell me what happened at the Beau-

</p>
<p>"I have never been at the Beaumont.
</p>
<p>What right have you to question me?" she
</p>
<p>cried, with flashing eyes.
</p>
<p>"What right have you to sit there as Miss
</p>
<p>Towne and answer that copper's questions?"
</p>
<p>he retorted. He had dropped his coaxing
</p>
<p>tone now; he realised that she must be
</p>
<p>driven to the wall if he hoped to get the truth
</p>
<p>from her.
</p>
<p>"You you frightened me. I didn't

<p>first time the tears welled up in her eyes.

<p>tone. "Come, come now, little girl. Listen.
</p>
<p>I know you did it."
</p>
<p>"No, no, I tell you, I did not!" she pro-

<p>tested vainly in a low, strangled tone. She
</p>
<p>glanced fearfully about at the doors, to see

<p>if any chance of rescue were at hand from

</p>
<p>"There is nothing to tell," she persisted
</p>
<p>desperately.
</p>
<p>"If that copper gets hold of you they'll
</p>
<p>give you the third degree, you know," hinted
</p>
<p>Jack. He spoke meaningly. "They'll
</p>
<p>never let up on you. You know that, don't

<p>you? Now what are you going to do?"
</p>
<p>In answer she moved towards the door.
</p>
<p>"I'm going to leave this place at once," she
</p>
<p>sobbed in dismay.
</p>
<p>Howell barred her exit. "Oh, no, you're

<p>not," he said.
</p>
<p>She recoiled from him trembling. He
</p>
<p>realised the crisis his next words must pre-

<p>cipitate, but he did not flinch.
</p>
<p>"Well?" There was no kindness in his

</p>
<p>hunter who sees a wounded animal at bay
</p>
<p>and fires the fatal shot to end its struggles,
</p>
<p>he launched his final words.
</p>
<p>"Do you want me to phone the police and
</p>
<p>tell them where they can find that stenogra-
</p>
<p>pher?" he suggested. He watched her nar-
</p>
<p>rowly, and caught the shiver that ran
</p>
<p>through her slight body. "Do you?" he de-
</p>
<p>manded again, as she made no sign. "Very
</p>
<p>well!"
</p>
<p>He reached for the telephone. The click
</p>
<p>of the receiver broke her rigid calm. With
</p>
<p>a cry she turned to him, shaken at last.
</p>
<p>"Don't give me up! For God's sake, don't
</p>
<p>give me up!" she sobbed.
</p>
<p>Howell placed his hand over the trans-
</p>
<p>mitter to shut out her voice. "Well?"
</p>
<p>"I'll tell you everything," she said brok-
</p>
<p>enly.
</p>
<p>"Never mind, central," called Howell to
</p>
<p>the waiting operator. "A mistake; I'm
</p>
<p>sorry."

</p>
<p>"I didn't mean to kill him," she moaned.
</p>
<p>"I swear I didn't mean to kill him." She
</p>
<p>sank into a chair and buried her face in
</p>
<p>her hands. Her body was shaken by con-
</p>
<p>vulsive sobs. She looked so fair and ten-
</p>
<p>der and defenceless that Jack could have
</p>
<p>gathered her up into his arms and petted
</p>
<p>her into quietude like a wayward child.
</p>
<p>He put his hand reassuringly on her
</p>
<p>shoulder.
</p>
<p>"Don't lose your nerve now. Don't,
</p>
<p>you'll need it," he said. Cautiously glanc-
</p>
<p>ing first in the direction of the doors, he drew
</p>
<p>a chair to her side. He hated himself for
</p>
<p>having brought this added anguish and tor-
</p>
<p>ture upon her head, but there had been no
</p>
<p>other way.
</p>
<p>He waited a moment for the sobs to
</p>
<p>cease, then said again: "Now tell me
</p>
<p>quickly. Take a chance with me," he
</p>
<p>urged. "It's the only one you have."

<p>She hesitated. "If I thought I could

<p>"The Scarlet Band?" he gasped. "Good

</p>
<p>She clenched her white hands. "What

<p>more than four years."

<p>"You? Fighting them? Why, you are

<p>"The truth," said Margaret Holt, bit-

<p>looking at her with grave eyes: "Well, if

</p>
<p>MARGARET'S STORY

<p>MARGARET'S story began in quiet country
</p>
<p>ways and pastoral moods to end in city
</p>
<p>filth like many another poor girl's tale be-
</p>
<p>fore it. It began on a lovely day in June,
</p>
<p>when a brother and sister stood in the rail-
</p>
<p>way platform in the little town of Chester,
</p>
<p>up in Maine.
</p>
<p>Victor Holt was a sturdy, wholesome fel-
</p>
<p>low of five and twenty. Margaret, who
</p>
<p>stood beside him, with tears in her wonder-
</p>
<p>ful grey eyes, was a slight girl of seventeen,
</p>
<p>to whose cheeks the Maine breezes had given
</p>
<p>the bloom of roses. The parting for these
</p>
<p>two was very hard, especially for Margaret,
</p>
<p>who was to be left behind. New York
</p>
<p>sounded very distant and remote to her that
</p>
<p>day, and Victor had been a devoted brother
</p>
<p>that she would sadly miss. Their parents

</p>
<p>had died when they were still little things,
</p>
<p>and even as a boy he had assumed the re-
</p>
<p>sponsibilities of a man over her life and
</p>
<p>keeping, and she could hardly bear to have
</p>
<p>him go. Uncle Mark, too, who had lived in
</p>
<p>New York for many years, had tried to dis-
</p>
<p>suade him from entering a field where influ-
</p>
<p>ence and money and new conditions counted
</p>
<p>so much towards success; but Victor had
</p>
<p>answered, "I know that I have neither money
</p>
<p>nor pull, but I feel that I shall win out, and
</p>
<p>anyhow I can take a good licking."
</p>
<p>As the distant whistle sounded through
</p>
<p>the hills, Margaret's hand gripped her
</p>
<p>brother's more closely. "It's hard to have
</p>
<p>you go, Victor," she said, with difficulty
</p>
<p>steadying her voice, "but I know that it is
</p>
<p>for the best and that you will succeed. I
</p>
<p>just know that you will. You can't help
</p>
<p>it."
</p>
<p>"Succeed! Of course I shall, honey, and
</p>
<p>it won't be long before I send for you to

<p>come to New York to keep house for me,"

<p>Victor replied proudly. And Margaret's
</p>
<p>98 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>face had brightened wonderfully at the pros-
</p>
<p>pect.
</p>
<p>With a heavy heart Margaret during
</p>
<p>those first days returned to old Judge Haw-
</p>
<p>ley's office, where she made herself useful as
</p>
<p>his stenographer. Her brother had read
</p>
<p>law there, and the kindly old man, who had
</p>
<p>been a dear friend of their father, had made
</p>
<p>them realise the interest and love and care
</p>
<p>that he should always feel for -these children
</p>
<p>of his old associate. As Margaret came into
</p>
<p>the office to resume her work, the Judge, no-
</p>
<p>ticing the expression of loneliness in her
</p>
<p>eyes, gave her a friendly little tap on the
</p>
<p>shoulder and exclaimed: "Now don't you
</p>
<p>worry about Victor! He's bound to win
</p>
<p>out. He's a clean boy and that means a
</p>
<p>healthy mind; he'll succeed, he'll succeed.
</p>
<p>Lord! but you'd know that to look at his
</p>
<p>face." And as the old man thought of the
</p>
<p>inflexible decision of the boy's mouth, he
</p>
<p>chuckled to himself again. "He'll succeed
</p>
<p>all right."

<p>And then before long there was Victor's

</p>
<p>first letter. He had taken an office down
</p>
<p>town and had hung out his shingle. "VIC-
</p>
<p>TOR HOLT, ATTORNEY AT LAW."
</p>
<p>"It looks great," he wrote, "but Uncle Mark
</p>
<p>can't see it with a telescope. And now grasp
</p>
<p>your chair and be prepared for a shock. I

<p>have a client ! A regular client ! My .cli-
</p>
<p>ent's name is John McKimmell, and Uncle
</p>
<p>Mark tells me that he is a well-known man

<p>here!" He closed his letter with : "If only

<p>I had you here with me, Sis. Well, if good

<p>fortune continues, it won't be long before we

<p>are together again. Shouldn't I like to

<p>feathers I've seen in the Fifth Avenue shop
</p>
<p>windows! Why! I've spent my first one
</p>
<p>hundred four times on you already."
</p>
<p>Again and again the girl read the precious
</p>
<p>letter: she laughed at what he wrote about
</p>

<p>she prayed for his success and for the day
</p>
<p>100 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>that should end their separation. She
</p>
<p>drifted off into the land of dreams at last
</p>
<p>where a venerable old gentleman, dressed in
</p>
<p>the most fluffy and diaphanous of Parisian
</p>
<p>gowns, chased her brother, who shed guns at
</p>
<p>every leap, into a house which flaunted in
</p>
<p>every window, the legend For Sale.
</p>
<p>The winter wore on, each week bringing a
</p>
<p>newsy letter from New York. Victor was
</p>
<p>getting on. Mr. McKimmell, his client, was
</p>
<p>pleased with his work and had given him
</p>
<p>more. His association with a man of such
</p>
<p>influence brought him in touch with other in-
</p>
<p>terests and led to more work, work for which
</p>
<p>he had a special aptitude. What little
</p>
<p>money he was making over expenses he was
</p>
<p>saving, he wrote, towards furnishing an
</p>
<p>apartment for himself and Margaret to
</p>
<p>share.
</p>
<p>There were many things to look back
</p>
<p>on in those days, as for instance when the
</p>
<p>expressman brought to that little Maine
</p>
<p>town a wonderful box for Margaret, con-

<p>taining her first evening gown and a note
</p>
<p>MARGARET'S STORY 101
</p>
<p>from Victor. He had seen it in a shop win-
</p>
<p>dow, he said, and it looked like her, so that he
</p>
<p>couldn't resist the temptation to buy it for
</p>
<p>her ; she was to have her photograph taken in
</p>
<p>it and send him the picture at once.
</p>
<p>Summer came and in its train a disap-
</p>
<p>pointment for Margaret, for Victor wrote
</p>
<p>that he should be unable to spend his vacation
</p>
<p>with her as he had planned ; that things were
</p>
<p>coming his way and he must stay "right on
</p>
<p>the job." There was just a flash of sun-
</p>
<p>light in the closing lines: "If all goes well
</p>
<p>I shall soon be able to take that little apart-
</p>
<p>ment and have you come to me." The hope
</p>
<p>that these words inspired lingered with her
</p>
<p>all the long Summer days.
</p>
<p>It was October when at last the summons
</p>
<p>came from Victor to join him in New York.
</p>
<p>"Dear Sis," he wrote, "pack up your duds
</p>
<p>and come on. I've taken an apartment up
</p>
<p>on One hundred and fourteenth Street;
</p>
<p>three rooms and a kitchenette."

<p>and stand half the rent. The place was
</p>
<p>102 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>small and the three of them would look like
</p>
<p>a crowd in it. She was to take the Bar Har-
</p>
<p>bor express from Ellsworth, and Victor was
</p>
<p>to meet her on the arrival of the train at the
</p>
<p>Grand Central Station in New York. She
</p>
<p>was to come as soon as the Judge could find
</p>
<p>some one to replace her in the office.
</p>
<p>A few days later she watched Judge
</p>
<p>Hawley from the city-bound train until he
</p>
<p>became a mere speck in the distance. The
</p>
<p>receding vision of her native hills brought a
</p>
<p>mist to her eyes. She was going forth with
</p>
<p>such confidence, such glowing faith in life
</p>
<p>and human nature. Alas, how soon were
</p>
<p>the realities of life, the latent, lurking evil
</p>
<p>things of life in a great city, to dim her
</p>
<p>youthful trustfulness !
</p>
<p>The journey was one long series of new
</p>
<p>adventures for the little county girl. First
</p>
<p>there had been the parting with her old
</p>
<p>friend, Judge Hawley, though the sadness
</p>
<p>of that had been relieved a little by the won-
</p>
<p>derful watch that he had placed in her hand

<p>when he said good-bye to her. He had at
</p>
<p>the same time given a greenback to the Pull-
</p>
<p>man porter and charged him to look after
</p>
<p>her comfort.
</p>
<p>The hours did not seem long, everything
</p>
<p>was so new to her in this first experience of
</p>
<p>all night travelling. She enjoyed her break-
</p>
<p>fast in the dining car, with its corps of wait-
</p>
<p>ers in spotless white coats and aprons, who
</p>
<p>managed their loaded trays so dexterously in
</p>
<p>the swaying of the train. She enjoyed the
</p>
<p>ever-changing landscape, and when darkness
</p>
<p>came, pictured to herself her brother's im-
</p>
<p>patience for her arrival. She wondered
</p>
<p>what she should do if he were not there to
</p>
<p>meet her ; but of course he would be.
</p>
<p>When the baggage transfer agent came
</p>
<p>through the car, following her brother's in-
</p>
<p>structions, she gave him her check, taking the
</p>
<p>address from her purse to be sure that she
</p>
<p>made no mistake. The lights along the track
</p>
<p>were becoming more numerous all the time.
</p>
<p>"Yes, they would soon be there," the porter
</p>
<p>told her, as he carefully brushed the dust

<p>from her coat over the bald head of the
</p>
<p>104 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>gentleman in the next seat to her. Slowly
</p>
<p>the train pulled into the great dreary sta-
</p>
<p>tion, and the tired passengers crowded into
</p>
<p>the aisles in their eagerness to leave.
</p>
<p>Margaret, clutching her little satchel in
</p>
<p>her hand, stepped from the car to the plat-
</p>
<p>form. Everywhere the porters with red caps
</p>
<p>were rushing about in search of patrons.
</p>
<p>The girl had expected that her brother would
</p>
<p>be on the very steps of the car to meet her,
</p>
<p>but the train porter laconically told her no
</p>
<p>one was allowed to come beyond the roped
</p>
<p>enclosure. She walked on a little bewil-
</p>
<p>dered, towards the expectant group of
</p>
<p>people waiting outside the train gates, and
</p>
<p>looked for Victor among the crowd, which,
</p>
<p>as it absorbed the incoming travellers, gradu-
</p>
<p>ally melted away but did not resolve itself
</p>
<p>into her brother. He was not there! A
</p>
<p>great wave of loneliness swept over her, and
</p>
<p>the tears gushed to her eyes. Where was
</p>
<p>Victor? The station seemed so immense
</p>
<p>and she such an atom in the rush of people

<p>hurrying by her. What should she do?
</p>
<p>MARGARET'S STORY 105
</p>
<p>Choking back her tears, she inquired of
</p>
<p>a white-capped official if there was any other
</p>
<p>place in the station where people awaited the
</p>
<p>arrival of passengers, and was directed to the
</p>
<p>waiting room above. Taking fresh courage
</p>
<p>she finally reached the place designated, los-
</p>
<p>ing her way once or twice in the perfect maze
</p>
<p>of passageways the re-construction of the
</p>
<p>station made necessary.
</p>
<p>In the waiting room she looked anxiously
</p>
<p>all about, but Victor was not there either.
</p>
<p>Now thoroughly frightened she decided to
</p>
<p>take a cab and seek the address her brother
</p>
<p>had given her. She opened her satchel to
</p>
<p>look for it, but alas, the purse containing her
</p>
<p>money and address was gone ; she must have
</p>
<p>dropped it when she arranged for her bag-
</p>
<p>gage transfer. It was all too tragic. She
</p>
<p>tried to recall the street and number. Was
</p>
<p>it One hundred and seventieth West, or One
</p>
<p>hundred and fortieth West, or One hundred
</p>
<p>and forty West One hundred and seventieth
</p>
<p>Street? The combinations were inexhausti-

<p>ble. The more she thought, the more
</p>
<p>106 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>jumbled they became. She thought of tele-
</p>
<p>phoning to Victor's office, but it was now
</p>
<p>after seven. He would not be there, and
</p>
<p>anyway she had no money. The moments
</p>
<p>passed and still her brother did not come.
</p>
<p>She was almost panic-stricken with fear.
</p>
<p>She hurried back to the train levels to find the
</p>
<p>porter of her car; he might have picked up
</p>
<p>her purse. But she reached the gate where
</p>
<p>her train had arrived, only to learn that the
</p>
<p>cars of her train had been backed out and
</p>
<p>that the porter was off duty. She was told
</p>
<p>that if any one of the train crew had picked
</p>
<p>up her purse it would be at Room 528. She
</p>
<p>hunted for Room 528, but found the halls
</p>
<p>dark at that hour, and closed.
</p>
<p>Again she sought the waiting room. The
</p>
<p>place was no longer crowded, but still there
</p>
<p>was no sign of Victor. Once she thought
</p>
<p>she saw him, and moved impulsively for-
</p>
<p>ward, only to discover that it was a stranger,
</p>
<p>who smiled at her and called her "Sweet-
</p>
<p>heart." Frightened and angry she turned

<p>away, seeking the ladies' waiting room,
</p>
<p>MARGARET'S STORY 107
</p>
<p>where she thought at least she might be free
</p>
<p>from annoyance.
</p>
<p>She was just deciding that the only thing
</p>
<p>to do was to stay where she was until morn-
</p>
<p>ing and she could telephone to her brother's
</p>
<p>office, when she was approached by a middle-
</p>
<p>aged woman, modestly dressed and of a most
</p>
<p>respectable appearance, who apparently was
</p>
<p>willing to be of some assistance to her.
</p>
<p>Margaret had seen her in the main waiting
</p>
<p>room and had noticed that she looked at
</p>
<p>her rather curiously. The woman seemed
</p>
<p>now to hesitate before speaking to the
</p>
<p>girl, and then said, gazing at Margaret's
</p>
<p>flushed and anxious face with a benev-
</p>
<p>olent smile, "Are you looking for any
</p>
<p>one?"
</p>
<p>"Yes," the girl replied. "My brother.
</p>
<p>He was to be here to meet me."
</p>
<p>"Who is your brother?"
</p>
<p>"Victor Holt. He is a lawyer here in
</p>
<p>New York," said Margaret.
</p>
<p>The woman gave a little exclamation of

<p>satisfaction.
</p>
<p>108 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>"Well," she exclaimed, "I thought you
</p>
<p>must be his sister, but I wasn't sure. I
</p>
<p>might have known, though, you look so much
</p>
<p>like him."
</p>
<p>"You know my brother?" Margaret asked
</p>
<p>eagerly.
</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, we are great friends. He sent
</p>
<p>me to meet you. I've been looking for you
</p>
<p>ever since your train came in," explained the
</p>
<p>elder woman.
</p>
<p>"Oh, did Victor send you to meet me?"
</p>
<p>cried Margaret, in great relief.
</p>
<p>"Yes; he was detained himself on impor-
</p>
<p>tant business," the woman said.
</p>
<p>Margaret was so relieved that no suspicion
</p>
<p>ever entered her head. "Oh I've been so
</p>
<p>worried," she confided. "It's the first time
</p>
<p>I have ever been in New York, and I seemed
</p>
<p>such a mite in the crowd. I think I lost my

<p>head. I could have gone directly to the

<p>Mark, and I have been awfully stupid about
</p>
<p>MARGARET'S STORY 109
</p>
<p>remembering the number. I think these
</p>
<p>numbered streets are so confusing to a
</p>
<p>stranger, don't you ? Poor old Judge ! I'm
</p>
<p>afraid he sent his telegram too late."
</p>
<p>"You poor child! I don't wonder that
</p>
<p>you were anxious," said the woman. "But
</p>
<p>you are all right now, aren't you?" She
</p>
<p>spoke with such kindly interest that Mar-
</p>
<p>garet felt a growing sense of relief in being
</p>
<p>with her.
</p>
<p>"What did you do with your luggage?"
</p>
<p>she asked presently.
</p>
<p>"I gave my trunk check to the baggage
</p>
<p>agent on the train. Wasn't that right?"
</p>
<p>asked Margaret.
</p>
<p>"Oh, yes; come on! We'll take a taxi and
</p>
<p>go right up to the house. It's getting late,
</p>
<p>and your brother will be anxious."
</p>
<p>The woman led the way out of the station
</p>
<p>and past the cab-stand. "We won't take
</p>
<p>one of these," she explained; "they are a lot
</p>
<p>of robbers. We can get one on Forty-
</p>
<p>second Street for half the money."

<p>As they walked along she talked pleas-

<p>110 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>antly with Margaret, and in such an ingra-
</p>
<p>tiating way that the girl placed her arm in
</p>
<p>that of her protector and chatted excitedly
</p>
<p>about her journey to the city without any
</p>
<p>further thought. She did not see the woman
</p>
<p>exchange glances with a sinister-looking man
</p>
<p>standing at the entrance to the station, nor
</p>
<p>did she see the man hurry away to where
</p>
<p>a limousine waited across the street and
</p>
<p>hold a hurried conversation with the chauf-
</p>
<p>feur. . '
</p>
<p>"Oh, there's a cab over there," said the
</p>
<p>woman as she piloted Margaret across.
</p>
<p>"Get in, my dear, I'll tell the chauffeur
</p>
<p>where to go."
</p>
<p>Blindly following directions, Margaret got
</p>
<p>into the car and gave a sigh of relief as she
</p>
<p>sank back into a corner of the comfortable
</p>
<p>seat. She was tired out after the long j our-
</p>
<p>ney and the excitement of her arrival. For
</p>
<p>a moment she closed her eyes from sheer ex-
</p>
<p>haustion. There was such a noise and
</p>
<p>rumble of traffic that she could not hear what

</p>
<p>the woman was saying to the chauffeur,
</p>
<p>though she was dimly conscious of something
</p>
<p>strange in it.
</p>
<p>The woman got in herself presently, and
</p>
<p>the chauffeur, slamming the door after her,
</p>
<p>put his car in motion.
</p>
<p>"Is it very far from here?" questioned
</p>
<p>Margaret weakly.
</p>
<p>"Oh, no, dear, we'll be there before you
</p>
<p>know it."
</p>
<p>The swinging car turned out of Forty-
</p>
<p>second Street and into Broadway, and Mar-
</p>
<p>garet had her first glimpse of The Great
</p>
<p>White Way.
</p>
<p>They sped on at a rapid pace, so rapid
</p>
<p>that once even the woman from New York
</p>
<p>knocked on the window to the chauffeur to
</p>
<p>be more careful. He continued recklessly
</p>
<p>notwithstanding. Margaret asked her com-
</p>
<p>panion if it were not dangerous, but Mrs.
</p>
<p>Watson, as the woman had by this time
</p>
<p>named and introduced herself, took little
</p>
<p>pains to reassure her, only muttered some-
</p>
<p>thing about "that fool of a chauffeur."

<p>Finally they stopped with a jerk before a
</p>
<p>112 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>high stone house, and "the fool of a chauf-
</p>
<p>feur" alighted and opened the door of the
</p>
<p>limousine for them.
</p>
<p>"Here we are," said Margaret's com-
</p>
<p>panion.
</p>
<p>As they were climbing the high flight of
</p>
<p>steps, the chauffeur stopped the woman with
</p>
<p>a rough demand for his "rake-off," and she
</p>
<p>handed him a bill, whereat the fellow only
</p>
<p>grinned, saying: "Come on, now, dearie.
</p>
<p>Come across with another five. I'm not

<p>taking chances at this game for nothing,

<p>hand shut off any further remarks.

<p>Margaret, in her eagerness to see her

<p>brother, was already half way up the steps
</p>
<p>and paid little heed to the wrangle between
</p>
<p>her companion and the driver. She had

<p>heard of grasping cabbies, before. The
</p>
<p>woman followed her, and opening the door
</p>
<p>explained to her that her brother's apart-

<p>ment was on the fourth floor. It had just oc-

<p>and excitement she had entirely omitted to
</p>
<p>MARGARET'S STORY 113
</p>
<p>thank her companion and protector, Victor's
</p>
<p>friend. She turned to express her thanks
</p>
<p>and make polite inquiries. They had
</p>
<p>reached their landing, where the woman
</p>
<p>opened a door, and before Margaret had time
</p>
<p>to realise her intentions pushed her violently
</p>
<p>into the room and turned the grating key in
</p>
<p>the lock.
</p>
<p>It had all happened so suddenly that even
</p>
<p>up to that moment Margaret had suspected
</p>
<p>nothing. She did not grasp the situation all
</p>
<p>at once. Then came a flash of understand-
</p>
<p>ing. This was not her brother's apartment.
</p>
<p>She had been trapped. In her terror she
</p>
<p>cried out "Victor! Victor!" But there was
</p>
<p>no answer anywhere.
</p>
<p>She tried to find the door, but whichever
</p>
<p>way she turned, the dense mystery of dark-
</p>
<p>ness baffled her. She groped about until
</p>
<p>finally her fingers touched the cool metal
</p>
<p>of a door-knob. She tried to make the

<p>door yield to her struggles. She threw her-

<p>self against it, a furious sense of frustration

<p>maddening her. She beat at the panels till

<p>114 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>her hands were bruised and bleeding, but to
</p>
<p>no avail. She never knew how long she
</p>
<p>fought for freedom, but gradually her
</p>
<p>strength gave way and she sank to the floor
</p>
<p>of her prison sobbing in a paroxysm of ter-
</p>
<p>ror.- Who was this woman who had brought
</p>
<p>her to this house? What place was it?
</p>
<p>What was the meaning of it all?
</p>
<p>Listening intently, she caught the sound of
</p>
<p>voices in the hall coarse voices and words
</p>
<p>followed by shrieks of laughter. Gathering
</p>
<p>up what little remaining strength she had,
</p>
<p>she made another frenzied assault upon the
</p>
<p>door, but the only result was a horrible,
</p>
<p>ominous silence that seemed to settle like a
</p>
<p>pall over the house.
</p>
<p>Then slowly, slowly into her mind crept
</p>
<p>the meaning of it all. Her very heart stood
</p>
<p>still in fear and horror. She remembered
</p>
<p>now having read of the fate of girls who had
</p>
<p>been lured to wicked houses and been com-
</p>
<p>pelled to live lives of shame and degradation

</p>
<p>THREE weeks dragged by, during which
</p>
<p>Margaret was compelled to submit to
</p>
<p>such a bondage, to treatment so atrocious
</p>
<p>and inhuman, that those who become its vic-
</p>
<p>tims must be either dragged down hardened
</p>
<p>into the pit by it, or choose drink or drugs or
</p>
<p>death as an escape from infamy and torture.
</p>
<p>At first the belief that her brother must
</p>
<p>come to her rescue kept the spark of hope
</p>
<p>alive, but as the interminable days wore on
</p>
<p>without any word or relief from him, even
</p>
<p>that feeble light died out and left her grop-
</p>
<p>ing in the darkness of despair. The thought
</p>
<p>of escape obsessed her, but at every attempt
</p>
<p>she made, at every struggle, the guards of
</p>
<p>her prison closed in more securely on her.
</p>
<p>She was never permitted to leave the

<p>prison yard, was her only means of taking the
</p>
<p>air. A total stranger to the city, she could
</p>
<p>get no idea of location. She could see the
</p>
<p>street below her, with its long line of shut-
</p>
<p>tered dwelling houses, but where the street
</p>
<p>led to or what it was she had no idea. Many
</p>
<p>times she was tempted to throw herself from
</p>
<p>the roof upon the pavement below, but each
</p>
<p>time some indefinable power had kept her
</p>
<p>from taking the fatal step.
</p>
<p>One day a policeman called at the house
</p>
<p>and Margaret happened to be in the hall.
</p>
<p>At the sight of the bluecoat her heart beat
</p>
<p>high with hope. At last! The law would
</p>
<p>protect her and punish those who had held
</p>
<p>her to this iniquitous servitude. But her
</p>
<p>agonised appeal for protection brought only
</p>
<p>fresh despair and disappointment. The po-
</p>
<p>liceman only laughed at her and turned her
</p>
<p>off.
</p>
<p>"What have you to kick about?" he
</p>
<p>smirked. "Haven't you a swell home here?
</p>
<p>Cut out your baby prattle and forget it!"

<p>too, but passed her by came in the shape of
</p>
<p>a pistol that she found by chance, and put
</p>
<p>away in her room. She would put an end to
</p>
<p>her horrible existence. She could endure no
</p>
<p>more. God would understand. With a
</p>
<p>fervent prayer for strength and courage, she
</p>
<p>brought from its hiding place the little, shiny
</p>
<p>revolver that a man had dropped in the hall
</p>
<p>the night before. She gazed at the thing
</p>
<p>with fascinated eyes ; it was the only key that
</p>
<p>would open the gates to freedom and im-
</p>
<p>penetrable eternity. For one moment the
</p>
<p>pendulum of indecision swayed between life
</p>
<p>and death.
</p>
<p>Then, as with steady hand Margaret raised
</p>
<p>the pistol to her temple, the door burst open,
</p>
<p>admitting a youth of not more than twenty,
</p>
<p>whose flushed countenance and staggering
</p>
<p>steps told the tale of some protracted de-
</p>
<p>bauch. Margaret whirled about, hiding the
</p>
<p>revolver behind her, while the youth stared
</p>
<p>at her with a silly leer about the corners of
</p>
<p>his sensuous mouth. The girl stood like a

</p>
<p>To her surprise he only reeled back against
</p>
<p>the wall and whimpered in a maudlin tone:
</p>
<p>"Don't be cross with me, dearie! You hurt
</p>
<p>my feelings, that's what you do. I don't
</p>
<p>want anything of you. I only want to go to
</p>
<p>sleep, d'y hear? Go to sleep! Beautiful
</p>
<p>sleep! And don't wake me up for a year!"
</p>
<p>As he spoke he removed his soiled and
</p>
<p>rumpled garments, scattering them about the
</p>
<p>room in every direction, until, losing his bal-
</p>
<p>ance, he fell headlong upon the bed, and
</p>
<p>sank quickly into a drunken stupor.
</p>
<p>Margaret gave a long, quivering sigh of
</p>
<p>relief, as she realised that for the present she
</p>
<p>was safe once more. Stealthily she returned
</p>
<p>the revolver to its hiding place, then me-
</p>
<p>chanically began to gather up the garments
</p>
<p>that the sleeping man had scattered on the
</p>
<p>floor. As she did so, a sudden thought
</p>
<p>vitalised her benumbed brain. At last she
</p>
<p>had her opportunity for escape! She bal-
</p>
<p>anced the chances of success or failure. It
</p>
<p>took her but an instant to decide. God

<p>was good ! It must be success.

<p>120 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>Stealing to the bedside she bent over its
</p>
<p>prostrate occupant and listened to his heavy
</p>
<p>breathing. She shook him to make sure that
</p>
<p>he was more than dozing. Good! She
</p>
<p>could not rouse him.
</p>
<p>He was of her complexion, with black hair,
</p>
<p>and of about her height, she noticed. It was
</p>
<p>all providential.
</p>
<p>Hastily slipping out of her gown, she put
</p>
<p>on the youth's clothes and his long overcoat,
</p>
<p>over them, then the tall silk hat. Her reflec-
</p>
<p>tion in the mirror satisfied her that she might
</p>
<p>elude detection, but she must hide her hair
</p>
<p>beneath the tile. There was such a mass of
</p>
<p>it that try as she would, she could not conceal
</p>
<p>it at first beneath the hat, and only by close
</p>
<p>braiding got it all hidden at last.
</p>
<p>Passing out of the room into the hall, she
</p>
<p>listened breathlessly. The house was still.
</p>
<p>Summoning all her courage, she descended
</p>
<p>the stairs, lurching as she proceeded, in
</p>
<p>feigned intoxication in case any one should
</p>
<p>hear or see. She was half way down the

</p>
<p>A WHITE SLAVE 121
</p>
<p>Mrs. Dumont's parlour almost stopped the
</p>
<p>beating of her heart for good and all.
</p>
<p>But Mrs. Dumont, thrusting her frowsled
</p>
<p>head into the hall, only gave an exclamation
</p>
<p>of rage. That kid had been deposited in her
</p>
<p>hallway only a short time before by a grin-
</p>
<p>ning chauffeur and she ordered him thrown
</p>
<p>out ; why was he here still? Who had dared
</p>
<p>to disobey her orders? As she beheld the
</p>
<p>reeling figure in the dimly lighted hall she
</p>
<p>broke into a storm of oaths and abuse, and
</p>
<p>seizing the youth by the shoulder and fling-
</p>
<p>ing open the door pushed him out vigor-
</p>
<p>ously herself, exclaiming: "You get out of
</p>
<p>here now! Go home, and don't you come
</p>
<p>here drunk again! Do you hear?"
</p>
<p>In another moment Margaret found her-
</p>
<p>self sprawling on the side-walk and heard
</p>
<p>the front door close with a slam behind
</p>
<p>her.
</p>
<p>Bruised and hurt by her fall, she rose to
</p>
<p>her feet and ran as fast as her legs would
</p>
<p>carry her; in what direction she knew not,

<p>she had but one idea to put as great a space
</p>
<p>122 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>as possible between her and that awful
</p>
<p>house.
</p>
<p>She had covered a distance of some two
</p>
<p>blocks when the burly form of a policeman
</p>
<p>loomed in the distance. Once she would
</p>
<p>have turned confidently to the blue-coat for
</p>
<p>protection, but her experiences had taught
</p>
<p>their lesson. Darting into a doorway, she
</p>
<p>crouched in its shadow in breathless suspense
</p>
<p>till the man had passed, then seeing him at a
</p>
<p>safe distance from her she started again on
</p>
<p>her mad flight.
</p>
<p>Turning a street corner, she came next
</p>
<p>into sudden collision with a portly priest, and
</p>
<p>before the benign and astonished Father
</p>
<p>could regain his breath had thrown herself
</p>
<p>into his arms with a despairing cry for pro-
</p>
<p>tection.
</p>
<p>"Save me!" she gasped between spent
</p>
<p>breaths. "Save me, for God's sake, save
</p>
<p>me!"

<p>"What is it?" cried the priest as he looked

<p>peal. "Save you from what? What's hap-
</p>
<p>pened to you, my boy?"
</p>
<p>"I'm not a boy," faltered Margaret; "I'm
</p>
<p>a girl!"
</p>
<p>"A girl!" exclaimed the astounded priest.
</p>
<p>"A girl, are you? And a slip of a one at
</p>
<p>that. What are you doing, running about
</p>
<p>the streets in togs like this?" he added
</p>
<p>sternly.
</p>
<p>Margaret, believing that his cloth meant
</p>
<p>protection, told her story without reserve or
</p>
<p>hesitation. As she finished her tale the
</p>
<p>priest in him became submerged in the man.
</p>
<p>"The fiends! The devils," he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>"I'd like to take off my coat and go there this
</p>
<p>very minute and clean out the dirty sink-
</p>
<p>hole."
</p>
<p>"You won't let them take me back? Oh,
</p>
<p>you won't, will you, Father?" pleaded Mar-
</p>
<p>garet.
</p>
<p>"My child, I'd protect you from the devil
</p>
<p>himself," said Father Connelly.

<p>"Then please, please, take me to my

<p>of me or he would have found me by now."
</p>
<p>"I'd take you to him this minute if we

<p>could find him. But we'll have to wait till I

<p>With comforting assurance he half sup-

<p>ported, half carried Margaret to the iron
</p>
<p>gates of the Home of The Sacred Child in
</p>
<p>Forty Street.
</p>
<p>"Here we are," he said cheerily. He had

<p>no sooner spoken than he felt the arm of the

<p>girl relax its hold upon his own, and her un-

<p>conscious body slipped down upon the pave-

<p>ment before him in a faint.
</p>
<p>Tenderly lifting her in his arms, he carried

<p>her into the Convent and laid her upon a

<p>through a sea of clouds, in which flashed sud-

<p>A WHITE SLAVE 125
</p>
<p>den, lurid fragments of dreadful things.
</p>
<p>In the distance she heard a clock strike the
</p>
<p>hour, and then the clamouring echo of the
</p>
<p>chimes.
</p>
<p>She roused herself with a start. "Where
</p>
<p>am I?" she moaned.
</p>
<p>"Hush, child," answered a sweet voice.
</p>
<p>"Rest, dear, you are safe among friends."
</p>
<p>She stroked the girl's burning forehead,
</p>
<p>hoping to calm her into sleep, and Marga-
</p>
<p>ret's troubled eyes fell upon the gold cross
</p>
<p>that hung from the slender chain about the
</p>
<p>Sister's neck. She reached forward and
</p>
<p>clasped the little thing in her hand. With
</p>
<p>its touch her eyes closed. A feeling of peace
</p>
<p>settled on her. She was back again in the
</p>
<p>little church at Chester. The thick, white
</p>
<p>clouds were closing in upon her again fast,
</p>
<p>and through the mist came the voice of the
</p>
<p>dear old clergyman who had christened her,
</p>
<p>reading his favourite psalm. The voice died
</p>
<p>away, and she drifted with the clouds back
</p>
<p>into unconsciousness, and then on to dreams.

<p>She sat on the bank beside the old river.

<p>126 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>The sun was flooding it with evening colours,
</p>
<p>tipping the church steeple with glowing car-
</p>
<p>mine. To Margaret's cheeks it lent its
</p>
<p>colourful brush as well, but its glow could
</p>
<p>not reach her heart or warm it. She thought
</p>
<p>of the past months; of the terrible illness
</p>
<p>which had brought her to the very gates of
</p>
<p>death. Why, why had the Sisters brought
</p>
<p>her back to life, she wondered dully. Here
</p>
<p>in Chester with the dear old Judge she was
</p>
<p>safe; he only knew her story. But what
</p>
<p>could life hold for her now? It was Spring.
</p>
<p>The world of nature had awakened, and was
</p>
<p>full of hope and expectation. For what had
</p>
<p>she the right to hope ? She, like other girls,
</p>
<p>had had her happy dreams but no! She
</p>
<p>must not think, she would not! She had

<p>promised Victor. The ripple of the flowing

<p>water caught her ear. There was the river;
</p>
<p>there was the solution of her problem.
</p>
<p>What was there to prevent her from slipping
</p>
<p>silently out to sea by way of the river?

<p>scene about her sank into her consciousness.
</p>
<p>The river sparkled and rippled on its way,
</p>
<p>happily and cheerily fulfilling its mission;

<p>near at hand the cattle in the meadow peace-
</p>
<p>fully nibbled their evening meal, and high
</p>
<p>in air a night hawk gave its queer shrill
</p>
<p>call.
</p>
<p>Her spirit roused from its brooding and
</p>
<p>stretched its wings once more towards the
</p>
<p>light. How marvellous was the world, how
</p>
<p>splendid its achievements ! The sense of her
</p>
<p>degradation dropped from her like a cloak.
</p>
<p>A growing knowledge of power and good
</p>
<p>lifted her face to the hills.
</p>
<p>Christ had suffered and toiled that others
</p>
<p>might be saved, she told herself. Why

<p>brother she adored, to work with him to save

<p>from misfortune girls like herself?

<p>he had begun against the iniquitous traffic

<p>that had blighted his sister's life. At first

<p>he had protested in horror, but the girl had

<p>met and demolished every argument he ad-

<p>vanced, and finally won his consent to her

<p>participation in his work.
</p>
<p>Together they had worked, together they
</p>
<p>struggled against obstacles that would have

<p>disheartened the most valiant. The first dis-

<p>couraging failure had been the attempt to

</p>
<p>You have the youth and determination. I
</p>
<p>believe you to be the man for the cause, the
</p>
<p>man to win out."
</p>
<p>With the philanthropist's aid, Victor Holt
</p>
<p>commenced the fight. Step by step, day by
</p>
<p>day, year by year he and Margaret worked
</p>
<p>together. Rescuing here, preventing there,
</p>
<p>occasionally securing a conviction and an ar-
</p>
<p>rest, unswervingly, persistently they pushed
</p>
<p>on the work. Though Margaret shunned all
</p>
<p>publicity and no one in her brother's office
</p>
<p>knew her face, her co-operation was more
</p>
<p>than efficient, nevertheless.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile a new man had been appointed
</p>
<p>District Attorney, Horton by name. His
</p>
<p>office would be no sinecure, for all the
</p>
<p>strength of his department was needed now
</p>
<p>to cope with the wave of crime that was
</p>
<p>sweeping over the city, flouting morality,
</p>
<p>outraging decency. The Scarlet Band, the
</p>
<p>most notorious gang of criminals that had
</p>
<p>ever sported in the underworld, was rapidly
</p>
<p>coming to be a terror and menace to society.

<p>Abduction, burglary, murder, all were grist

<p>A WHITE SLAVE 131
</p>
<p>to its mill. So well organised was it that the
</p>
<p>police were completely baffled at every at-
</p>
<p>tempt to round it up. There could be no
</p>
<p>mistaking any one of their enterprises ; their
</p>
<p>trade-mark was always left behind ; a mock-
</p>
<p>ing letter to the blue-coats, in an envelope
</p>
<p>encircled by a scarlet band.
</p>
<p>The District Attorney, who had recog-
</p>
<p>nised Holt's fighting qualities as the kind of
</p>
<p>metal now needed in his office, made Victor
</p>
<p>his assistant, inciting him to wage war
</p>
<p>against this band of criminals with all his
</p>
<p>strength and all the facilities his office af-
</p>
<p>forded. Realising what this recognition of
</p>
<p>his work by the authorities meant to him,
</p>
<p>Holt took fresh courage and pushed relent-
</p>
<p>lessly on. The first intimation that he had
</p>
<p>touched the gang in any vital place came
</p>
<p>when he had received a message scrawled on
</p>
<p>a piece of paper, encircled by a scarlet band,
</p>
<p>which read: "Victor Holt: You fool with
</p>
<p>us, we make you a dead man. We mean
</p>
<p>what we say and do it. Beware !"

<p>CHAPTER X
</p>
<p>THE MURDER OF JAMES MORTON
</p>
<p>BRAVELY and fully Margaret told her story,
</p>
<p>told it all. At times she must pause and
</p>
<p>could hardly go on. When she uttered the
</p>
<p>words: "One day a great brute of a
</p>
<p>man >" with a strangled cry of agony she
</p>
<p>buried her face upon her arms outstretched
</p>
<p>upon the table.
</p>
<p>The reporter was staring down at her with
</p>
<p>eyes of unutterable sympathy and horror.
</p>
<p>"God!" he groaned between stiff lips. And
</p>
<p>at that moment the boy in Howell's nature
</p>
<p>slipped away forever, leaving in its place a
</p>
<p>man ripe with power to contend and to pre-
</p>
<p>vail. "Oh," he thought, "if I could only
</p>
<p>take her away from all this, shield her, make
</p>
<p>her forget!" Then a fresh realisation of the
</p>
<p>peril she was in at that moment swept over
</p>
<p>him: "Go on!" he urged hoarsely.

</p>
<p>134 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>Rallying her strength Margaret told of
</p>
<p>the events that led up to the moment when
</p>
<p>she reached the Rossamano.
</p>
<p>Closer and closer the net was drawn in
</p>
<p>about the Scarlet Band. Victor and his in-
</p>
<p>defatigable workers were full of hope that
</p>
<p>the end was in sight.
</p>
<p>It was in November, when the suspicions
</p>
<p>of Holt's right-hand man and ablest detect-
</p>
<p>ive, Bill Flynn, were aroused by the actions
</p>
<p>of James Morton, a man residing at the Ho-
</p>
<p>tel Beaumont, where he occupied a suite of
</p>
<p>apartments and ostensibly carried on a cut-
</p>
<p>lery agency for the St. Louis firm of Hills-
</p>
<p>dorf & Co.
</p>
<p>It was not so much Morton himself, who
</p>
<p>made Flynn suspicious, as the strange cus-
</p>
<p>tomers, mostly Italian or Spanish, who
</p>
<p>called upon him. In the person of one of
</p>
<p>these the detective had recognised a man, a
</p>
<p>foreigner, who had been arrested some time
</p>
<p>before for being implicated in the White
</p>
<p>Slave traffic, but had escaped conviction be-

</p>
<p>cause of some flaw in the evidence against
</p>
<p>MURDER OF MORTON 135
</p>
<p>him. Furthermore Holt had sent a letter to
</p>
<p>Hillsdorf & Co. asking for the name of their
</p>
<p>New York agent, and the letter had been re-
</p>
<p>turned, bearing information from the post-
</p>
<p>master that there was no firm of that name
</p>
<p>in St. Louis.
</p>
<p>Again Flynn had seen several "want" ad-
</p>
<p>vertisements cut from the papers which read
</p>
<p>suspiciously, and referred the applicant, al-
</p>
<p>ways a woman, to "Suite 5, Hotel Beau-
</p>
<p>mont."
</p>
<p>"Suite 5 is occupied by our friend Mor-
</p>
<p>ton," said Flynn. "We ought to send some
</p>
<p>one down to land that job of stenographer."
</p>
<p>"You're right, Flynn," agreed Victor.
</p>
<p>"But whom could we send? We've no one
</p>
<p>on our staff who knows enough about sten-
</p>
<p>ography to make good even in that position.
</p>
<p>I wouldn't trust an outsider. Who the
</p>
<p>Dickens can we send?"
</p>
<p>"Send me," suggested Margaret, who had
</p>
<p>been a silent but attentive listener.
</p>
<p>"You!" ejaculated her brother. "Non-

</p>
<p>sense, not for a moment."
</p>
<p>136 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>"But I know stenography," persisted
</p>
<p>Margaret ; and she added quietly but firmly,
</p>
<p>"I shall try for that position."
</p>
<p>So that was how one day Margaret Holt
</p>
<p>called at the Hotel Beaumont and was
</p>
<p>shown to Mr. Morton's apartments on the
</p>
<p>third floor.
</p>
<p>As she waited for the cutlery merchant to
</p>
<p>interview the one other applicant present she
</p>
<p>had an opportunity to observe the man, and
</p>
<p>did so carefully.
</p>
<p>He was of middle height, with heavily built
</p>
<p>shoulders. His face, which had the swarthy
</p>
<p>complexion of the Latin, was hard and cruel,
</p>
<p>and from a sinister expression about the
</p>
<p>mouth derived an evil look which the cold,
</p>
<p>piercing eyes, glowering under bristling eye-
</p>
<p>brows, curiously accentuated. He was im-
</p>
<p>maculately dressed, and had almost the lan-
</p>
<p>guage and the manners of a gentleman.
</p>
<p>Evidently the applicant to whom he was
</p>
<p>talking was too experienced or was not
</p>
<p>pretty enough. "No," he concluded curtly.

</p>
<p>"You won't do. The work does not call for

<p>MURDER OF MORTON 137
</p>
<p>one of your experience, or the pay which you
</p>
<p>should command. You know too much.
</p>
<p>Thank you for calling," he added courte-
</p>
<p>ously as he opened the door. "Good day!"
</p>
<p>Margaret inferred that Mr. Morton was
</p>
<p>not looking for brains, and decided that it
</p>
<p>was her cue to appear rather dense. She
</p>
<p>answered the questions he put her with as
</p>
<p>much obtuseness as she could feign.
</p>
<p>"H'm," mused Morton, after a moment's
</p>
<p>deliberate study of Margaret's face.
</p>
<p>"You'll do. Oh," he added as though
</p>
<p>weighing her usefulness, "do you understand
</p>
<p>Spanish or Italian?"
</p>
<p>Margaret's heart sank. After all was he
</p>
<p>going to say that she wouldn't suit. "No,"
</p>
<p>she faltered, "but I can learn."
</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter," he said quickly.
</p>
<p>"We can manage all right. It's only that
</p>
<p>many of my customers come from the Italian
</p>
<p>quarter, and you might have to wait on
</p>
<p>them."
</p>
<p>Crossing the room he opened the door on

<p>the right. "The typewriter is in there,
</p>
<p>138 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>where you will do your work. This is my
</p>
<p>sample room," he explained as he pointed to
</p>
<p>a long table upon which were displayed
</p>
<p>samples of cutlery of divers sorts. "When
</p>
<p>can you begin work?"
</p>
<p>" Now," replied Margaret in feigned
</p>
<p>eagerness.
</p>
<p>"Good-a!" For the first time Margaret
</p>
<p>caught a slight accent. He gave her some
</p>
<p>papers, instructing her to make several
</p>
<p>copies of them, as they were his new price
</p>
<p>list. "By the way," he said, as he called
</p>
<p>back, "I forgot to ask your name."
</p>
<p>"Mary Hadfield," answered Margaret
</p>
<p>promptly and started again for her work-
</p>
<p>room. She had almost reached the door
</p>
<p>when three sharp rings from the telephone
</p>
<p>on Morton's desk arrested her. She turned
</p>
<p>to answer the call but Mr. Morton hastily
</p>
<p>took off the receiver before her. "Savelli!"
</p>
<p>the word passed from his lips with a sharp-
</p>
<p>ness quite in contrast to the languid tones in

</p>
<p>which he had addressed the girl. Before he
</p>
<p>MURDER OF MORTON 139
</p>
<p>spoke again he placed his hand over the
</p>
<p>transmitter, as though to muffle the reso-
</p>
<p>nant voice of the person with whom he was
</p>
<p>in communication, and turning towards
</p>
<p>Margaret said sharply, "What are you wait-
</p>
<p>ing for?"
</p>
<p>"I thought you spoke to me, sir," she
</p>
<p>said stupidly.
</p>
<p>"I did not. Close your door and begin
</p>
<p>your work," was his snarling command.
</p>
<p>Margaret obeyed. Evidently Mr. Mor-
</p>
<p>ton had business of an extremely private na-
</p>
<p>ture. With her ear to the key-hole, she lis-
</p>
<p>tened carefully, while Morton in rapid and
</p>
<p>excited tones continued his conversation at
</p>
<p>the telephone. He was speaking in Italian,
</p>
<p>but once Margaret caught the word "Holt."
</p>
<p>Presently he stopped speaking and she heard
</p>
<p>the click of the instrument as he hung up the
</p>
<p>receiver. Instantly she sprang to the type-
</p>
<p>writer and began a hurried manipulation of
</p>
<p>the keys, blundering hopelessly as she tried

</p>
<p>to imagine what significance the name Holt
</p>
<p>140 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>might have in that conversation. Her con-
</p>
<p>jectures were interrupted by the opening of
</p>
<p>her door.
</p>
<p>"I'm going out," said her employer
</p>
<p>briefly. "You may go when your work is
</p>
<p>finished. Do not come till ten in the morn-
</p>
<p>ing."
</p>
<p>"Very well, sir," she replied, and began
</p>
<p>to work on her typewriter laboriously.
</p>
<p>The outer door closed after Mr. Morton
</p>
<p>and she gave a sigh of relief. For a few
</p>
<p>moments she sat motionless, thinking of the
</p>
<p>queer work she had elected to do. She was
</p>
<p>there to spy on this man, to get all the infor-
</p>
<p>mation she could about him. She hated the
</p>
<p>part of a spy ; but she had volunteered to do
</p>
<p>it and do it she would, to the best of her
</p>
<p>ability.
</p>
<p>Hoping to get some clue of value she first
</p>
<p>tried the desk. It was locked. The waste-
</p>
<p>paper basket yielded no secrets either. A
</p>
<p>door on the left, partly concealed by a por-
</p>
<p>tiere, stood ajar; quickly she opened it, and

</p>
<p>perceived that the room beyond was a bed-
</p>
<p>MURDER OF MORTON 141
</p>
<p>room, probably Morton's. She entered and
</p>
<p>made careful but fruitless search of the
</p>
<p>drawers of the dresser; examined the ample
</p>
<p>supply of clothing that hung in the closet
</p>
<p>and was rewarded by finding two letters ad-
</p>
<p>dressed to Pedro Alvarez, General Deliv-
</p>
<p>ery, New York City. They were written
</p>
<p>in Italian and signed "Savelli." Her heart
</p>
<p>gave a bound as she remembered that Savelli
</p>
<p>was the name she had heard Morton repeat
</p>
<p>at the telephone. She had three names now.
</p>
<p>What was the bond of interest between
</p>
<p>James Morton, Pedro Alvarez and Savelli,
</p>
<p>then?
</p>
<p>Her conjectures were suddenly termi-
</p>
<p>nated by an imperative knock on the door.
</p>
<p>Waiting only to conceal the letters in her
</p>
<p>blouse she answered it and two men con-
</p>
<p>fronted her as she opened the door. One
</p>
<p>was a tall, wiry Italian, with a scar across his
</p>
<p>cheek which gave to his face a horribly ma-
</p>
<p>levolent expression; the other a Jew, small
</p>
<p>and meagre, whose shifty eyes and nervous

</p>
<p>snapping of the fingers gave the impression
</p>
<p>142 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>of a man in constant apprehension of dan-
</p>
<p>ger.
</p>
<p>The tall man scrutinised Margaret coldly
</p>
<p>and then pushed by her into the room, leav-
</p>
<p>ing the Jew to take his stand at the win-
</p>
<p>dow, from which he nervously watched the
</p>
<p>street below.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Morton, is he not here?" questioned
</p>
<p>the Italian.
</p>
<p>"No," answered Margaret. "He left an
</p>
<p>hour ago."
</p>
<p>At her reply the Jew snapped his fingers
</p>
<p>impatiently and his companion smothered
</p>
<p>an oath between his teeth. "When will he
</p>
<p>come back?" demanded the latter roughly.
</p>
<p>"He did not say," answered the girl, be-
</p>
<p>ginning to be seriously alarmed in the pres-
</p>
<p>ence of this evil-looking pair.
</p>
<p>Again the tall man gave her a piercing
</p>
<p>look as he asked, "You his new sten-og-
</p>
<p>rapher?"
</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," said Margaret.
</p>
<p>The two men began an examination of the

<p>cutlery displayed on the table, talking ear-
</p>
<p>MURDER OF MORTON 143
</p>
<p>nestly in undertones as they did so. Mar-
</p>
<p>garet strained her ears to hear something of
</p>
<p>the conversation, but whether it referred to
</p>
<p>business or personal matters, she could not
</p>
<p>determine.
</p>
<p>At last the Jew left the table and went to
</p>
<p>the window again, and after making another
</p>
<p>careful survey of the street, telegraphed the
</p>
<p>result of his scrutiny to the other by a nod
</p>
<p>of the head. Apparently this was a signal
</p>
<p>that the coast was clear in the street below,
</p>
<p>for the two men at once made their way to
</p>
<p>the door.
</p>
<p>"Will you leave your names?" Margaret
</p>
<p>inquired in a business-like tone.
</p>
<p>"Say Mr. Savelli and Mr. Weinberg,"
</p>
<p>replied the tall man; "I will call Mr. Mor-
</p>
<p>ton later on the telephone."
</p>
<p>The following morning Margaret was at
</p>
<p>her post a little before ten o'clock. Morton,
</p>
<p>taking his Continental breakfast of rolls and
</p>
<p>coffee, paid little heed to her as she entered,
</p>
<p>merely telling her to make more copies of

</p>
<p>the price list. There were no customers at
</p>
<p>144 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>all during the day, and as her employer
</p>
<p>did not leave the apartment she found
</p>
<p>no opportunity to continue her investiga-
</p>
<p>tions.
</p>
<p>At about four o'clock, however, Morton
</p>
<p>received a woman caller, for whom he him-
</p>
<p>self opened the outer door of the apartment.
</p>
<p>Margaret saw the woman as she entered and
</p>
<p>threw back her heavy veil before Morton
</p>
<p>came and quickly closed the door of her
</p>
<p>room. Through the partly opened transom
</p>
<p>above came the sound of their voices, the
</p>
<p>woman's having decidedly the accent of
</p>
<p>Southern Spain. From the glimpse she
</p>
<p>had had of the beautiful, sensual, highly-
</p>
<p>coloured face and from her salutation "Mia
</p>
<p>Pedro" Margaret knew this foreigner to be
</p>
<p>a member of the band.
</p>
<p>"Why did you come here, Juanita?" de-
</p>
<p>manded Morton savagely. "Haven't I told
</p>
<p>you that it was dangerous?"
</p>
<p>She began a reply in Spanish, but the
</p>
<p>man interrupted her with a curse. "Speak

<p>dialect of yours. Why did you make such
</p>
<p>a bungle of that last affair, when you had
</p>
<p>the girl almost in your hands?"
</p>
<p>"I could do nothing," the woman
</p>
<p>answered meekly; "there is now always some
</p>
<p>of Mr. Holt's men to watch."
</p>
<p>"Holt! Pah! He thinks our warning to
</p>
<p>keep his hands off .our affairs is a joke. He
</p>
<p>has strengthened*^ the conspiracy by not be-
</p>
<p>lieving it. I have it all arranged for him
</p>
<p>soon. The fool!" Margaret could hear the
</p>
<p>rapid pacing of his steps. "The fool!" he
</p>
<p>went on. "Either there will come an end to
</p>
<p>our business or to him. How does he know
</p>
<p>our plans? Who is the traitor?"
</p>
<p>"We had better leave New York, Pedro,
</p>
<p>before it is too late," urged the woman
</p>
<p>anxiously.
</p>
<p>"Run away! Confess myself beaten by
</p>
<p>that fool Holt? For two years we have
</p>
<p>made monkeys of the police, why not of
</p>
<p>him?" he demanded scornfully. Then after

<p>day? What do you want?"
</p>
<p>146 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>"The list of the members of the Society,"
</p>
<p>she answered in a trembling voice.
</p>
<p>"Ah, the list! Yes!" He hesitated a
</p>
<p>moment. "Yes, you must have it to notify
</p>
<p>the members of the meeting at Guiseppe
</p>
<p>Pelatro's on Saturday."
</p>
<p>"It is no longer safe to meet at Guisep-
</p>
<p>pe's."
</p>
<p>"Not safe! Why?"
</p>
<p>"It is watched."
</p>
<p>At this information Morton grew almost
</p>
<p>purple with passion. "Some more of that
</p>
<p>damned Holt's work I suppose. Tell Sa-
</p>
<p>velli to come on Thursday at five o'clock for
</p>
<p>the list. If I am not here he will find it"
</p>
<p>he crossed the room till he came near the
</p>
<p>door of his bed-room, then bending, pulled
</p>
<p>up a corner of the carpet "there. Do you
</p>
<p>understand, Juanita? There."
</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," assented the woman. "On
</p>
<p>Thursday he is to come at five o'clock for it
</p>
<p>and if you are not here he will find it there."
</p>
<p>"Good," he ejaculated. "Tell him not to

</p>
<p>MURDER OF MORTON 147
</p>
<p>in vicious exultation, "that we'll have noth-
</p>
<p>ing to fear from Holt after Thursday."
</p>
<p>"What are you going to do? Oh, Pedro,
</p>
<p>do leave New York."
</p>
<p>"Leave? I?" he cried scornfully. "Not
</p>
<p>I. I'm safe, I tell you, safe."
</p>
<p>"Safe, Pedro! I tell you that man Holt
</p>
<p>is watching us, marking us down, checking
</p>
<p>us for prison, every one of us!" Her voice
</p>
<p>rose almost to an hysterical scream on the
</p>
<p>last word.
</p>
<p>"Hush, you fool," cautioned Morton.
</p>
<p>Then he added soothingly: "You stay and
</p>
<p>have dinner with me, Juanita. Go in there
</p>
<p>until I call you." He pushed her into the
</p>
<p>bedroom and closed the door, and after wait-
</p>
<p>ing a moment opened the door of Mar-
</p>
<p>garet's room, saying as he did so: "You
</p>
<p>may go now, Miss Hadfield, and you need
</p>
<p>not come again until Friday, business is so
</p>
<p>very slack."
</p>
<p>But with the morning came the convic-
</p>
<p>tion that she must go to the Beaumont that

<p>day at all costs. She must get that list be-
</p>
<p>148 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>fore Savelli came. How could she get into
</p>
<p>the apartment, she wondered. Morton had
</p>
<p>told her not to come back; doubtless he had
</p>
<p>given instructions to the hotel people not
</p>
<p>to admit his stenographer if she came there.
</p>
<p>With her mind alert to every chance of
</p>
<p>success or failure, her heart beating hard and
</p>
<p>fast, Margaret made her way to the Beau-
</p>
<p>mont. Entering, she avoided the elevator
</p>
<p>and climbed the stairs gradually to the third
</p>
<p>floor. There she peered down the hall and
</p>
<p>to her surprise saw that Morton's door was
</p>
<p>open. She crept to a dark hall-way almost
</p>
<p>opposite and could hear him giving direc-
</p>
<p>tions to a porter to take his luggage down
</p>
<p>and order a taxi for him.
</p>
<p>What could be the meaning of this ? Was
</p>
<p>he preparing for flight? Was he taking the
</p>
<p>list with him? No, Savelli was to come for
</p>
<p>it at five o'clock, and it was now only half-
</p>
<p>past four. There was still the chance that
</p>
<p>the paper lay safe in its hiding place.
</p>
<p>On tip-toe she approached the"half-open

<p>door. She heard Morton moving about in
</p>
<p>MURDER OF MORTON 149
</p>
<p>his bedroom. Quietly she stole into the
</p>
<p>sample room, then into the room where she
</p>
<p>had worked. Here she crouched in the
</p>
<p>darkness by the window, reasoning that if
</p>
<p>she heard him coming she could creep out on
</p>
<p>to the fire-escape w r hich she knew was there.
</p>
<p>Her heart was beating so hard it seemed to
</p>
<p>her that Morton must hear it. Her body
</p>
<p>grew cold with fear as she realised her situ-
</p>
<p>ation.
</p>
<p>In a few minutes, it seemed hours to the
</p>
<p>girl waiting in agonised suspense, she heard
</p>
<p>the man come out of his room, close his desk
</p>
<p>with a bang and switch off the lights. Then
</p>
<p>the hall door slammed and she knew that she
</p>
<p>was alone.
</p>
<p>Waiting until after she heard the elevator
</p>
<p>descend, she groped for the light button and
</p>
<p>pressed it. Where to look for the list she
</p>
<p>did not know, but crossing to go to the bed-
</p>
<p>room her foot, as luck had it, struck a ridge
</p>
<p>in the carpet. Down on her knees she went,
</p>
<p>and pulling up the corner of the carpet she

<p>found a long sealed envelope beneath it.
</p>
<p>150 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>At last she had found it! Slipping the
</p>
<p>precious thing into her blouse, she was just
</p>
<p>rising to her feet when she heard the sound
</p>
<p>of a key in the lock. This time her very
</p>
<p>heart stood still. She was trapped like a
</p>
<p>rat in a cage.
</p>
<p>She had no time to hide. As Morton en-
</p>
<p>tered the room, she stood with her back
</p>
<p>against the wall, her two burning, glowing
</p>
<p>eyes, the only spots of colour in her white
</p>
<p>face.
</p>
<p>Morton stepped quietly into the room,
</p>
<p>closing the door behind him and slipping the
</p>
<p>bolt into place, glaring at the girl. Then
</p>
<p>his eyes travelled from her to the desk with
</p>
<p>its opened drawers, to the knife lying on the
</p>
<p>floor beside it. There was a cruel smile on
</p>
<p>his lips and his eyes glistened.
</p>
<p>"So my little stenographer spy, eh!
</p>
<p>Well, I have my spies, too. That's how I
</p>
<p>know who you are! You devil!" he almost
</p>
<p>hissed the words. "You should have been
</p>
<p>more careful, my dear. You should have re-

<p>turned those two letters !"
</p>
<p>MURDER OF MORTON 151
</p>
<p>Margaret's stiff lips refused to open, her
</p>
<p>brain was suggesting and rejecting plans
</p>
<p>with the rapidity of lightning ; her eyes were
</p>
<p>fixed on Morton in a fascinated stare.
</p>
<p>"Your brother," he continued slowly, as
</p>
<p>though he meant every torturing word to
</p>
<p>sink deep into the girl's mind, "is now at the
</p>
<p>Cafe Rossamano, dining with a friend.
</p>
<p>Three of my friends are waiting for a word
</p>
<p>from me to put an end to him, do you under-
</p>
<p>stand? To put an end to him." He moved
</p>
<p>as he spoke, to the desk, and grasped the
</p>
<p>telephone. "I am going to give that word
</p>
<p>now."
</p>
<p>Margaret sprang towards him. "No, for
</p>
<p>God's sake, no ! Take your vengeance upon
</p>
<p>me if you will, not upon him. Not upon
</p>
<p>him!"
</p>
<p>"Ill take my vengeance on you all right,
</p>
<p>too, after I've settled him," he sneered.
</p>
<p>Then, "Give me 983 Spring," he cried.
</p>
<p>"No! You shall not give that word,"
</p>
<p>Margaret called hoarsely, as she sprang upon

<p>him, trying to take the ear piece from him.
</p>
<p>152 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>With his free hand he caught the girl by
</p>
<p>the throat and held her down against the
</p>
<p>desk, while he called, "Is that you, Savelli?
</p>
<p>Holt" Margaret's left hand came loose
</p>
<p>with desperate force, covering his mouth.
</p>
<p>With an oath he caught it and thrust it
</p>
<p>away. As he bent her backwards, her right
</p>
<p>hand came in contact with the knife lying on
</p>
<p>the floor. A wild impulse to save her
</p>
<p>brother came to her with the touch of the
</p>
<p>cold steel. She seized the knife and before
</p>
<p>Morton could move, with all her magnificent
</p>
<p>young strength, had struck it into him above
</p>
<p>the heart.
</p>
<p>With a groan, the wretched man dropped
</p>
<p>the instrument he was holding, and stag-
</p>
<p>gered back against the wall. Then, snatch-
</p>
<p>ing at the house telephone as he swayed, he
</p>
<p>muttered into it thickly: "Quick! I have
</p>
<p>been stabbed by a woman. She " and
</p>
<p>then he fell.
</p>
<p>Margaret gazed at his lifeless form in
</p>
<p>horror. Had she, Margaret Holt, done this

</p>
<p>MURDER OF MORTON 153
</p>
<p>hand answered her. She grew faint and
</p>
<p>sick and would have fallen, had not the
</p>
<p>sound of voices and hurrying feet warned
</p>
<p>her to keep her senses. She must escape,
</p>
<p>she must get the papers to her brother. She
</p>
<p>could not get out by the door, she would meet
</p>
<p>the alarmed household. She steadied her
</p>
<p>frenzied mind. She must think! Quickly
</p>
<p>she turned to the room in which she had
</p>
<p>worked, gently opened the window and
</p>
<p>climbed out on to the fire escape, made her
</p>
<p>way down swiftly and dropped to the

<p>ground. Across the street was a cab.

<p>Jumping in, she said to the driver: "Quick!

<p>"Two men dragged him across the street

<p>through her eyes. "You mustn't look at me
</p>
<p>with those eyes," he said with an attempt at
</p>
<p>his old cheery manner. "It gets my mind
</p>
<p>off my work, and," growing serious again,
</p>
<p>"there's a big work to be done, and from this
</p>
<p>moment Jack Howell is on the job."
</p>
<p>Bang went the street door again. Mar-
</p>
<p>garet slipped hurriedly behind the desk and
</p>
<p>Howell took up his station where he could
</p>
<p>watch the revealing mirror from behind a
</p>
<p>newspaper.
</p>
<p>A grey-haired man entered quietly, as he
</p>
<p>did so casting a cautious, stealthy glance,
</p>
<p>first at the girl, then at the reporter. The
</p>
<p>latter became uneasy. Was this a plain-
</p>
<p>clothes man who had tracked the girl here?
</p>
<p>Watching from behind his paper, he saw the
</p>
<p>new-comer go to the reading table, and re-
</p>
<p>move his hat, always with his eyes on Mar-
</p>
<p>garet. Next he saw him push a book from

<p>the table to the floor, purposely.

<p>little cry and turning quickly saw the

</p>
<p>stranger give a warning look in his direc-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>"It is all right, Uncle," she whispered.
</p>
<p>"Uncle!" The reporter understood and
</p>
<p>turned to meet the stern eyes that scrutinised
</p>
<p>him so keenly.
</p>
<p>"Are you her friend?" demanded the old
</p>
<p>man.
</p>
<p>"That's your best little bet!" said How-

<p>ell, as he looked towards the girl to confirm

<p>his eager assertion.
</p>
<p>"It's all right, Uncle, he is our friend.
</p>
<p>You may speak before him. Did you bring

<p>it?" she asked breathlessly.
</p>
<p>"Yes." He drew from his pocket a

<p>scroll of paper around which Howell saw a

<p>scarlet band. With trembling fingers the

<p>girl took the mysterious missive to the light
</p>
<p>on the desk.
</p>
<p>"What is it?" questioned Howell eagerly.

<p>Howell, stunned and stupefied, could

<p>make no answer to her pitiful appeal ; it was

<p>brought him to his senses.

<p>As Howell felt of the envelope his hands
</p>
<p>twitched with excitement. "But are you
</p>
<p>sure that this is the list they want?"
</p>
<p>"Yes. Why else should they be so eager
</p>
<p>to get it back?"
</p>
<p>"That's right. But if you send them this
</p>
<p>without first learning its contents, all your
</p>

<p>nothing."
</p>
<p>"Oh, what does it matter, if only I get
</p>
<p>Victor back. I can do nothing alone. To-
</p>
<p>gether, he and I can begin all over again,"

<p>she said wearily.
</p>
<p>"But if you send this," urged Howell,

<p>"they've got what they want, and then what

<p>is to prevent their killing your brother sure

<p>160 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>"But is he?" persisted the skeptical How-
</p>
<p>ell, who doubted if the Devil himself would
</p>
<p>be safe with that gang.
</p>
<p>"Won't they hold him to keep her quiet?"
</p>
<p>suggested Uncle Mark.
</p>
<p>"Yes: you are right. That is just what
</p>
<p>they will do. I guess there is nothing for
</p>
<p>us but to come across with the goods." He
</p>
<p>looked at the sealed envelope. "I wonder if
</p>
<p>I could pry it open?"
</p>
<p>"No, no! Don't try!" begged Margaret.
</p>
<p>"Remember it must be returned as I found
</p>
<p>it."
</p>
<p>"All right! I won't," Jack reluctantly
</p>
<p>assented. "But it seems a shame to give
</p>
<p>that up. They would have to come and
</p>
<p>take it from my dead body if I had my way."

<p>Again his twitching fingers felt of the en-

<p>touch he might read its contents. "It's

<p>lights: but to no avail. It remained im-
</p>
<p>CLAVERING'S NEW NOVEL 161
</p>
<p>penetrable. "I can't see a thing," he cried
</p>
<p>impatiently. He hated to acknowledge
</p>
<p>himself beaten in his first encounter with the
</p>
<p>Scarlet Band. But so far he was forced
</p>
<p>to admit defeat.
</p>
<p>What should his next step be? "I have
</p>
<p>it!" he called. Then as his idea crystallised
</p>
<p>he exclaimed, "I've got it!"
</p>
<p>"What is it?" asked Margaret eagerly.
</p>
<p>"Trust your Uncle Dudley! Will you
</p>
<p>trust me?"
</p>
<p>"What is it?"
</p>
<p>"Never mind. You leave it to me."
</p>
<p>Jerking his watch from his pocket; "How
</p>
<p>much time have I? I can make it," he cal-

<p>culated. "Good!" Then he unfolded his
</p>
<p>plan. "I will take this thing to the church
</p>
<p>myself."
</p>
<p>"No, no," protested the girl; "it would be
</p>
<p>risking your life. One of the gang who was

<p>at the Rossamano might come for it and

<p>recognise you."

<p>one of those pirates again."
</p>
<p>162 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>"No, no, you don't know them as we do!"
</p>
<p>"I would not chance it," advised cautious
</p>
<p>Mark Wilson.
</p>
<p>Howell reflected for a moment. It was
</p>
<p>taking a chance, he knew. If he were to
</p>
<p>play any part in this desperate game he
</p>
<p>must not be known to any member of the
</p>
<p>gang. "Perhaps you are right," he agreed
</p>
<p>finally. Then he caught at another idea.
</p>
<p>"Wait a minute ! I know a man, Andy Riv-
</p>
<p>ers; he's a down and out reporter hanging
</p>
<p>round our office. He'll do anything for two
</p>
<p>dollars."
</p>
<p>"But he might ask questions," cautioned
</p>
<p>Margaret.
</p>
<p>"All he will ask is, do I get the two?" de-
</p>
<p>clared Howell. "I'll get Rivers to take the
</p>
<p>package to the church while I hang round
</p>
<p>somewhere and see who comes to get it.
</p>
<p>Then I'll trail the gink and perhaps get a
</p>
<p>line on where those gangsters have your
</p>

</p>
<p>"Find Victor?"

<p>"Why not? It's a long chance, but let's

</p>
<p>try it! We won't call ourselves licked
</p>
<p>yet! Now if any more of those pink notes
</p>
<p>come from the crime set, just get them to me
</p>
<p>at the Telescope office," instructed Howell,
</p>
<p>handing the elder man one of his cards.
</p>
<p>"And mind!" he added emphatically. "Not
</p>
<p>a word to the police; you understand that!"
</p>
<p>"Yes, absolutely," Wilson replied. "I
</p>
<p>know the danger there."
</p>
<p>So Jack took up his hat to depart on his
</p>
<p>pilgrimage to St. Anne's. Then he stopped
</p>
<p>and looked gravely at the girl. "But what
</p>
<p>about you?" he asked. "You can't stay
</p>
<p>here."
</p>
<p>"Yes, I can. Miss Towne said she would
</p>
<p>find some place for me."
</p>
<p>"But it wouldn't be safe. You have got
</p>
<p>to live in a vault till we get this thing over."
</p>
<p>"He is right," agreed her uncle. "They
</p>
<p>would kill you and Victor both. You know
</p>
<p>they would!"
</p>
<p>"But where can I go?"

<p>gested Howell. "But if those ginks should
</p>
<p>164 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>spot me they might find you, too. You
</p>
<p>have got to disappear, that's all!" he said
</p>
<p>vehemently. "But where, where?" Walk-
</p>
<p>ing up and down he tried desperately to
</p>
<p>think of some solution to his problem.
</p>
<p>"I don't want any of them. They
</p>
<p>won't do at all!" Clavering's petulant voice
</p>
<p>sounded from the hall. He continued to pay
</p>
<p>his respects to an employment bureau where
</p>
<p>he had had to search hours, hours, unsuccess-
</p>
<p>fully for a stenographer, respects that were
</p>
<p>copious and valuable.
</p>
<p>Miss Towne, looking flushed and angry,
</p>
<p>followed him into the room and came directly
</p>
<p>to Margaret. "My dear," she said in an un-
</p>
<p>dertone, "I heard Dr. Christopher go out,
</p>
<p>and I knew that you were all alone here, but
</p>
<p>I just didn't dare leave that ugly man to

</p>
<p>hours! Must have my sleep," he mocked.
</p>
<p>"Only fools need a lot of sleep!" He began
</p>
<p>to gather up his books.
</p>
<p>Howell looked at him. Was this a dis-
</p>
<p>pensation of Providence? "You want a
</p>
<p>stenographer?" he inquired of Clavering.
</p>
<p>"Yes," he snapped, "but I guess I'll have
</p>
<p>to have one made to order."
</p>
<p>"Why don't you try this young lady?"
</p>
<p>asked Jack, indicating Margaret.
</p>
<p>Clavering shot an inquiring glance at the
</p>
<p>surprised girl.
</p>
<p>"Are you a stenographer?" he said.
</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," Margaret replied at once.
</p>
<p>"Don't sir me, or I'll have to Miss you,
</p>
<p>and I won't stand that," Clavering growled.
</p>
<p>"She has done very good work for me,"
</p>
<p>Howell interposed. "She's all right."
</p>
<p>"How much sleep do you require?" the
</p>
<p>novelist demanded.
</p>
<p>"I can do with very little," smiled Mar-
</p>
<p>garet.
</p>
<p>"Well, that is all you are likely to get.

<p>You look more intelligent than most of those
</p>
<p>166 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>dolled-up ladies. Do you want the job?"
</p>
<p>Margaret looked at Howell. "I should
</p>
<p>like to try it," she replied.
</p>
<p>"Come along then, I'll make the salary
</p>
<p>all right."
</p>
<p>Without further parley, he turned to
</p>
<p>gather up his books again; then suddenly
</p>
<p>stopped to ask her an important question.
</p>
<p>"Do you know anything about crime?"
</p>
<p>Margaret and Howell started at this un-
</p>
<p>expected bomb.
</p>
<p>"Crime? What do you mean?" the girl
</p>
<p>faltered, shrinking before his piercing gaze.
</p>
<p>"H'm," he chuckled. "You will before
</p>
<p>you have worked long for me. I eat with
</p>
<p>it. I sleep with it." He began wrapping
</p>
<p>his crane-like neck in the folds of a worsted
</p>
<p>muffler, preparatory to departing.
</p>
<p>"It's just the thing," Howell explained
</p>
<p>in an undertone to the bewildered girl.
</p>
<p>"He lives like a hermit. You can disappear
</p>
<p>in his house. I will keep in touch with
</p>
<p>you."

<p>This conversation, carried on in an under-
</p>
<p>I
</p>
<p>CLAVERING'S NEW NOVEL 167
</p>
<p>tone, did not escape the eagle eye of the nov-
</p>
<p>elist. "Oh," he said, coming to Margaret.
</p>
<p>"There's another thing I forgot to ask you."
</p>
<p>He gave a questioning look towards Howell.
</p>
<p>"Have you got a feller?"
</p>
<p>"Why, I don't know what you mean," re-
</p>
<p>plied the puzzled girl.
</p>
<p>"A feller, a sweetheart who will come call-
</p>
<p>ing on you and interrupt my work."
</p>
<p>"No, I have no sweetheart."
</p>
<p>"Good! Don't ever have one. The last
</p>
<p>stenographer I had left to be married.
</p>
<p>Married! Rot! No woman is interesting
</p>
<p>after you have lived with her a week! No
</p>
<p>man is interesting after you have talked with
</p>
<p>him an hour."
</p>
<p>Further comments were cut short by Miss
</p>
<p>Towne. She did not feel that she ought to
</p>
<p>let Margaret take this position ; yet she had
</p>
<p>no good reason to offer in objection. She
</p>
<p>approached Clavering. "I am sorry that
</p>
<p>you thought that Miss Brown would not
</p>
<p>do," she began graciously.

<p>The novelist snapped her up. "I don't
</p>
<p>168 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>think. I know. Besides, I have engaged
</p>
<p>this young woman."
</p>
<p>At this moment Howell received a shock.
</p>
<p>He saw Captain Ryan passing the window.
</p>
<p>He must not come in and discover, through
</p>
<p>Miss Towne, that Margaret was not the Sec-
</p>
<p>retary. "Excuse me, Miss Towne," he said
</p>
<p>quickly, "if you will ask Miss Brown to wait
</p>
<p>a moment perhaps I can put her onto a posi-
</p>
<p>tion."
</p>
<p>"Certainly. I will go at once," the secre-
</p>
<p>tary answered, and left the room. Her exit
</p>
<p>was timely, for the officer was just entering.
</p>
<p>"I want to use this telephone," he said,
</p>
<p>stepping to the desk.
</p>
<p>"Go as far as you like, Captain," replied
</p>
<p>the anxious reporter. "It isn't mine."
</p>
<p>"Spring"
</p>
<p>Howell drew a long breath and Margaret
</p>
<p>shivered. Ryan was calling headquarters.
</p>
<p>"This is Ryan! Anything new? Fine"!
</p>
<p>I thought so !" With a grin of satisfaction
</p>
<p>he hung up the receiver and turned to How-

<p>ell, who tried to return his gaze with one of

</p>
<p>unconcern. "Well, I got the right dope on
</p>
<p>that case. We've got the woman who killed
</p>
<p>Morton!"
</p>
<p>With difficulty the reporter answered,
</p>
<p>"That so? Who was it?"
</p>
<p>"Why, I told you! The Spanish woman
</p>
<p>who called on him this afternoon. Just
</p>
<p>pinched her. Oh, we're a lot of muts, are
</p>
<p>we?"
</p>
<p>"Yes, you are!" almost screamed Claver-
</p>
<p>ing. "Spanish woman! Bosh! I tell you
</p>
<p>it was the stenographer."
</p>
<p>Ryan threw back his head with a hoarse
</p>
<p>guffaw of laughter. "Little Nemo! The
</p>
<p>boy sleuth. Always hands me a laugh."
</p>
<p>"Yes, and I'll hand you something else,"
</p>
<p>retorted Clavering, "if I catch the real mur-

<p>derer and walk into Headquarters with her."
</p>
<p>"Oh mercy, listen to him! You couldn't

<p>catch your own feet."

</p>
<p>"Aw!" retorted the maligned officer with
</p>
<p>a contemptuous jeer, "Get out and pump!
</p>
<p>You've got a flat tire !" and stalked out leav-
</p>
<p>ing Clavering white and choking with rage.
</p>
<p>"Did you hear what he called me?" he
</p>
<p>sputtered, appealing to Howell. "Did you
</p>
<p>hear? He called me a flat tire. I'll show

<p>der that will show exactly how it was done.

<p>Come on !" he commanded Margaret. "We
</p>
<p>must get right at it to-night."
</p>
<p>With this declaration he again gathered
</p>
<p>up the books he had let drop during his alter-
</p>
<p>cation with Captain Ryan.
</p>
<p>"What shall I do?" whispered Margaret
</p>
<p>to Howell. "Suppose he finds me out?
</p>
<p>He will give me up to the police ! Then Sa-
</p>
<p>velli and his men will know!"
</p>
<p>"It's too late now to turn back!" urged
</p>
<p>Jack. "You are not safe here a minute
</p>
<p>longer. It's the only way. We've got to

<p>turned, and he caught a glimpse of terror-

</p>
<p>JACK HOWELL DOES THINGS
</p>
<p>EVEN before Margaret Holt had left The
</p>
<p>Refuge with the eccentric author Jack How-
</p>
<p>ell began to realise the gravity of this new
</p>
<p>danger there might be for his protegee in the
</p>
<p>close association with a man of such crime-
</p>
<p>detecting propensities as Clavering. The
</p>
<p>slightest betrayal of her secret would not be
</p>
<p>lost on that fathoming, ferreting brain. The
</p>
<p>hunted girl plainly feared the position into
</p>
<p>which his own hasty judgment had thrust
</p>
<p>her, and the ordeal would be all the more
</p>
<p>trying on that account.
</p>
<p>"I was a fool!" he exclaimed to Mark
</p>
<p>Wilson. "I believe this head piece of mine
</p>
<p>is turning into solid ebony. I'm going to
</p>
<p>bring her back," he added and started im-
</p>
<p>pulsively towards the door.

</p>
<p>The old man caught him by the arm: "I
</p>
<p>wouldn't do that; it will only lead to ex-
</p>
<p>planations that might arouse Clavering's
</p>
<p>suspicions," he counselled.
</p>
<p>Howell thought a moment. "Right you
</p>
<p>are," he agreed. "We've got to chance it
</p>
<p>now; but somehow I wish I hadn't let her
</p>
<p>go! Well!" he said later, looking at his
</p>
<p>watch as he moved towards the door, "I'm
</p>
<p>going after that chap Rivers I told you
</p>
<p>about. I must get him to the church with

</p>
<p>along, he had time thoughtfully to review the
</p>
<p>174 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>exciting incidents of the last two hours. He
</p>
<p>quite realised that in aiding this girl he was
</p>
<p>assisting a fugitive from justice, but he had
</p>
<p>taken up her cause and he meant to see it to
</p>
<p>the finish, even if it landed him in jail.
</p>
<p>From now on her battle was his; she had
</p>
<p>trusted him and he would make good for her,
</p>
<p>no matter at what cost to himself. He had
</p>
<p>been looking for some excitement. "Well,
</p>
<p>I've got it good and plenty now and with a
</p>
<p>little extra thrown in," he thought with a
</p>
<p>wry smile.
</p>
<p>Margaret's strained, impassioned face
</p>
<p>haunted him all the way. As he went over
</p>
<p>again in his mind her story that she had so
</p>
<p>falteringly told him, compassionate tears
</p>
<p>came to his eyes, and the longing was strong
</p>
<p>to take her in his arms and defend her
</p>
<p>against all the world if need be. Then he
</p>
<p>shook himself. "Great Scott!" he thought.

<p>"Am I getting sentimental? Wake up, old

<p>He began his search for Andy Rivers.

<p>In the midst of it an idea flashed upon
</p>

</p>
<p>him as with a blinding light. He stood
</p>
<p>still where he was, clutching at the precious
</p>
<p>package in his breast pocket.
</p>
<p>"Why didn't I think of that before?" he
</p>
<p>muttered.
</p>
<p>"Dixon! He's the man for us in this
</p>
<p>crisis. Well, of course!"
</p>
<p>Accordingly one Kenelm C. Dixon,
</p>
<p>M.D., specialist in radiography, received
</p>
<p>an impetuous call from one Jack Howell
</p>
<p>before the half of a good hour had passed
</p>
<p>away that same day. He knew Jack and
</p>
<p>chaffed him now over his very visible ex-
</p>
<p>citement.
</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" he inquired.
</p>
<p>"Want an X-ray of your wish-bone?"
</p>
<p>"Cut out the comedy," retorted Jack,
</p>
<p>pulling the mysterious sealed package from
</p>
<p>his pocket. "This is too serious. Here's
</p>
<p>the idea. For certain reasons, which shall be
</p>
<p>nameless, this seal cannot be broken. Now
</p>
<p>what I want to know is, is it possible to

</p>
<p>176 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>Dixon took the envelope from Jack's
</p>
<p>hand and examined it closely.
</p>
<p>"Yes," he answered carefully, "it might
</p>
<p>be done if it is written in lead pencil or if
</p>
<p>there is any mineral matter in the ink
</p>
<p>fluid."
</p>
<p>"Then go to it!" commanded Howell,
</p>
<p>helping himself to one of Dixon's cigars and
</p>
<p>beginning to puff nervously at it as he
</p>
<p>eagerly watched the specialist arrange
</p>
<p>the apparatus for the experiment that
</p>
<p>meant so much to him. "Better take four
</p>
<p>or five negatives to make sure," he suggest-
</p>
<p>ed: "I don't want to take a chance at a
</p>
<p>fizzle."
</p>
<p>Dixon made four exposures of the pack-
</p>
<p>age, while the reporter watched his every
</p>
<p>movement with intense absorption. "When
</p>
<p>can I have the prints?" asked Jack.
</p>
<p>"Some time to-morrow," replied Dixon.
</p>
<p>"Where shall I send them!"
</p>
<p>"Don't send them anywhere. I'll call

<p>for them myself; and don't show them to a

</p>
<p>HOWELL DOES THINGS 177
</p>
<p>He had but little time now before ten
</p>
<p>o'clock, when the important missive must be
</p>
<p>placed in the pew in St. Anne's Church.
</p>
<p>He rushed off again in search of Andy Riv-
</p>
<p>ers, found him in a saloon, dragged him out,
</p>
<p>deposited him in a taxi, and proceeded in the
</p>
<p>seclusion of the closed cab to unfold his
</p>
<p>project to the bibulous ex-reporter in less
</p>
<p>time than it takes to say so.
</p>
<p>"Do you want to make five dollars?" de-
</p>
<p>manded Jack. "Real money?"
</p>
<p>"Sure I do!" answered the other.
</p>
<p>"Then listen," Howell went on. "Do you
</p>
<p>know where St. Anne's church is?"
</p>
<p>"Down town in the Italian Quarter. I
</p>
<p>know it."
</p>
<p>"Good," ejaculated Howell. "Then you
</p>
<p>won't waste any time finding it." He took
</p>
<p>the package from his pocket as he continued.
</p>
<p>"Now get this ! This cab is to take us down
</p>
<p>somewhere in the vicinity of the church.

<p>Do you understand? In the last pew on

</p>
<p>"Say, what is it? Dynamite?" queried
</p>
<p>Rivers, eyeing the mysterious package with
</p>
<p>a slight show of nervousness.
</p>
<p>"Nix! Nothing like it. All you have to
</p>
<p>do is to place it in that book, then walk out
</p>
<p>of the church and make a get-a-way as
</p>
<p>though you were scared to death."
</p>
<p>"Well, if that package contains nitro-
</p>
<p>glycerine you bet I can look the scare all
</p>
<p>right. When do I get the five?"
</p>
<p>"As soon as we reach the church."
</p>
<p>"You're on," chuckled Rivers. He
</p>
<p>thrust out his hand for the package quite
</p>
<p>keenly.
</p>
<p>"Fine," ejaculated Jack as he handed it
</p>
<p>to him. "Now tell the driver how to get to
</p>
<p>that church. Tell him to get a hustle on.
</p>
<p>We've no time to lose if we're going to put
</p>
<p>this over right. See?"
</p>
<p>Rivers did as Jack directed, and the cab
</p>
<p>moved off in the direction of St. Anne's.

</p>
<p>in formulating his plans for future action,
</p>
<p>the other anticipating the night he would
</p>
<p>put in with the promised five. Jack heard
</p>
<p>a neighboring clock tower strike nine.
</p>
<p>There was still an hour before the time set.
</p>
<p>A block away from the church they left
</p>
<p>the cab, and Jack, instructing his companion
</p>
<p>to wait ten minutes before entering, left him
</p>
<p>and made his own way to the chapel door
</p>
<p>and knocked for admittance on it.
</p>
<p>The door was opened by a verger who
</p>
<p>scrutinised the reporter carefully. Jack ex-
</p>
<p>plained that he had been sent by the electric
</p>
<p>light company to make an estimate for in-
</p>
<p>stalling power in the organ loft, at the same
</p>
<p>time presenting the card of an agent of the
</p>
<p>company who had wanted to wire his
</p>
<p>mother's house in Jersey. Satisfied with
</p>
<p>his credentials, the verger admitted him and
</p>
<p>piloted him to the loft, where he left him
</p>
<p>with pad and pencil in his hand ostensibly
</p>
<p>busy with measures and figures.
</p>
<p>Left alone, the reporter glanced down

</p>
<p>into the dimly lighted church. The pews
</p>
<p>180 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>were vacant, save one on the left side, near
</p>
<p>the door, in which he could discern the bent
</p>
<p>form of a veiled woman deeply engaged in
</p>
<p>her devotions. Moving back into a shadow
</p>
<p>he had a position from which he could com-
</p>
<p>mand a view of the church completely, re-
</p>
<p>maining himself unseen. He glanced nerv-
</p>
<p>ously at his watch: the time was nearly up.
</p>
<p>He began to get uneasy; he wished he had
</p>
<p>not given Rivers the money so soon: the
</p>
<p>temptation of a drink at a near-by saloon
</p>
<p>might be too strong for him the whole proj-
</p>
<p>ect might miscarry. But his anxiety was
</p>
<p>relieved in a moment, when he saw Rivers
</p>
<p>enter the church as they had duly arranged,
</p>
<p>and make his way to the last seat on the
</p>
<p>right-hand side. At the same time Jack
</p>
<p>saw the woman on the opposite side slowly
</p>
<p>turn her head in the new-comer's direction.
</p>
<p>"H'm," he muttered. "That's it, eh?"
</p>
<p>Rivers lost no time in the execution of his
</p>
<p>mission, and in another moment hurriedly
</p>
<p>left the church. Eagerly Howell watched

<p>the woman to see what move she would now
</p>
<p>HOWELL DOES THINGS 181
</p>
<p>make. For some minutes her head re-
</p>
<p>mained bowed. Then rising, she glanced
</p>
<p>cautiously all about the edifice, and walked
</p>
<p>slowly over to the seat in which Rivers had
</p>
<p>been seated and knelt again there devoutly.
</p>
<p>The reporter felt his heart beating like a
</p>
<p>trip-hammer. What should he do? To
</p>
<p>descend out of the loft now might arouse
</p>
<p>suspicion; he might be detained by the ver-
</p>
<p>ger's questions. He decided to take the
</p>
<p>chance, the woman's movements were so de-
</p>
<p>liberate that she probably would not leave
</p>
<p>in a hurry. He reached the front of the
</p>
<p>church without being waylaid at all and lost
</p>
<p>himself in the shadow of a doorway by the
</p>
<p>holy water font. He had not long to wait
</p>
<p>before the veiled woman appeared and
</p>
<p>passed through the vestibule.
</p>
<p>He followed her at a safe distance until
</p>
<p>she reached a house on Fourth Street, which
</p>
<p>after a hasty look up and down the street,
</p>
<p>she entered hurriedly. Jack stopped only
</p>
<p>long enough to make sure of the number,

</p>
<p>traced his steps to the church and made a
</p>
<p>careful examination of the prayer book in
</p>
<p>the last pew on the right-hand side. The
</p>
<p>package was gone! His heart beat wild
</p>
<p>with hope, for he knew that he had touched
</p>
<p>a living clue.
</p>
<p>The next morning after his eventful pil-
</p>
<p>grimage to St. Anne's, Howell was touring
</p>
<p>up and down Fourth Street in a curtained
</p>
<p>taxi, and looked long at the house into which
</p>
<p>the devout, veiled woman had disappeared
</p>
<p>the night before. It was like all the others
</p>
<p>in the block except for its closed shutters.
</p>
<p>There were bars at the attic windows, but
</p>
<p>so were there old-fashioned bars at many
</p>
<p>other windows in the street. "They must
</p>
<p>use the top floors in this neighbourhood for
</p>
<p>babies and lunatics," thought Jack.
</p>
<p>Just across the street, directly opposite
</p>
<p>the house of mystery, a sign "Rooms to
</p>
<p>Rent" in a second story window attracted
</p>
<p>his attention. "That's the gag!" he said to
</p>
<p>himself excitedly; "I couldn't beat that if I

<p>cheated! Driver, back to Broadway!"
</p>
<p>HOWELL DOES THINGS 183
</p>
<p>That night Mark Wilson called at the
</p>
<p>house that had the room for rent ; explained
</p>
<p>to the slatternly woman who came to the door
</p>
<p>that he was looking for a room for a friend
</p>
<p>and himself; that the friend worked nights
</p>
<p>and would occupy the room during the day.
</p>
<p>A month's rent in advance satisfied the not
</p>
<p>hypercritical landlady, and the next morn-
</p>
<p>ing Andy Rivers, whom the nimble-minded
</p>
<p>Howell had attached to his hastily mustered
</p>
<p>secret-service bureau by means of the prom-
</p>
<p>ise of a fat weekly stipend, took possession
</p>
<p>of it. From that time on Mark Wilson by
</p>
<p>night and Rivers by day kept watch of the
</p>
<p>house on Fourth Street, each man reporting
</p>
<p>duly to Howell when he went off duty.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the self-appointed sleuth was
</p>
<p>cautiously and vigilantly watching develop-
</p>
<p>ments and keeping his own counsel. Clav-
</p>
<p>ering's prediction as to the absurdity of

<p>thinking the Spanish woman the slayer of

<p>Morton was fulfilled, for after a short de-
</p>
<p>tention she was released, having established

</p>
<p>so?" the author chuckled gloatingly to How-
</p>
<p>ell, when he met him on the street. "The
</p>
<p>police! Huh, I'll show 'em yet."
</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the excitement in the city
</p>
<p>over the sudden and mysterious disappear-
</p>
<p>ance of the Assistant District Attorney was
</p>
<p>of course intense. John McKimmell was ill
</p>
<p>from grief and anxiety. The papers were
</p>
<p>full of wild conjectures. One report had it
</p>
<p>that Holt had been murdered; another that
</p>
<p>he had been abducted; but upon one point
</p>
<p>they all agreed. The press from one end of
</p>
<p>the country to the other burst forth in caustic
</p>
<p>editorials condemning the laxity that made
</p>
<p>such an outrage possible. The thinking
</p>
<p>public was horrified at the probable fate that
</p>
<p>had overtaken its idolised official, and though
</p>
<p>the police were in earnest co-operation with
</p>
<p>the District Attorney, day after day passed
</p>
<p>by and no trace of the missing man could be
</p>
<p>found.
</p>
<p>Jack Howell kept silent and waited.
</p>
<p>He was not actuated now by any selfish de-

<p>sire to land a scoop and make his lasting rep-

</p>
<p>utation. His heart and mind were set upon
</p>
<p>rescuing Holt from the clutches of the gang
</p>
<p>that held him prisoner ; the game was deeper
</p>
<p>than he had thought, but he had taken a hand
</p>
<p>in it and would keep on now without any
</p>
<p>thought of danger or reward. He must
</p>
<p>work alone. The slightest suspicion abroad
</p>
<p>of what he knew meant everything inimical
</p>
<p>to his plans. The Scarlet Band was watch-
</p>
<p>ing, spying, waiting, with a knife at its cap-
</p>
<p>tive's heart, ready at a word to close his lips
</p>
<p>forever. The sentence in the letter:
</p>
<p>"Your brother is safe as long as nothing is
</p>
<p>known," Howell felt, justified his caution.
</p>
<p>Three days passed after his meeting with
</p>
<p>Margaret at The Refuge, before he made an
</p>
<p>attempt to see her again. He feared the
</p>
<p>wily old Clavering more than any one else,
</p>
<p>however, and he must see if everything was
</p>
<p>all right in that quarter. Late one after-
</p>
<p>noon a leisurely stroll in the vicinity of the
</p>
<p>novelist's house was rewarded by the sight
</p>
<p>of the owner of it just starting out on his

</p>
<p>evening walk. The reporter waited until
</p>
<p>186 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>Clavering had shambled off round the cor-
</p>
<p>ner, then he boldly approached the house and
</p>
<p>rang the bell. The coloured housekeeper
</p>
<p>at first stoutly refused to admit him, but
</p>
<p>when, with an ingratiating smile, he pressed
</p>
<p>a bill into her smoky palm, she grew more
</p>
<p>tractable.
</p>
<p>"I got 'splicit instructions," she informed
</p>
<p>him grandiloquently, "not to 'low anybody
</p>
<p>in hyere. But I reckon if you'se come to
</p>
<p>see dat new type-writer I can just keep
</p>
<p>m'self in ignorance of it. Yars, Sir!"
</p>
<p>After this he had made several calls on
</p>
<p>Margaret, but they were brief, as there was
</p>
<p>always the fear of Clavering's return from
</p>
<p>his ten minutes' exercise. The girl was very
</p>
<p>brave ; Howell knew that the look of fear in
</p>
<p>her eyes came from worrying about her
</p>
<p>brother as much as for herself. When he
</p>
<p>expressed anxiety lest the strain should be
</p>
<p>too much for her, she comforted him with
</p>
<p>the assurance that he could not have found
</p>
<p>a better place for her. No one ever came

<p>to the house. No one was ever allowed to
</p>
<p>HOWELL DOES THINGS 187
</p>
<p>enter the study but the faithful Martha.
</p>
<p>She, Margaret, might be living in a distant
</p>
<p>planet, so secluded was she from the world
</p>
<p>of men and events. She acknowledged
</p>
<p>that the work was hard and the hours long:
</p>
<p>sometimes Clavering would rouse her from
</p>
<p>sleep even in the middle of the night to take
</p>
<p>his dictation if the inspiration seized him;
</p>
<p>but he was not unkind, he seemed to like her
</p>
<p>work, and even praised her for her speed and
</p>
<p>accuracy.
</p>
<p>She listened with breathless interest to
</p>
<p>every word Jack had to tell her of the prog-
</p>
<p>ress of his search for Victor. She tried to
</p>
<p>find words in which to thank him, but her
</p>
<p>gratitude was inexpressible: the thing was
</p>
<p>beyond words now for both of them.
</p>
<p>Jack wanted no thanks from her. It
</p>
<p>seemed to him only right and natural that he
</p>
<p>should protect and shield her. He had made
</p>
<p>no women friends since he had come to New
</p>
<p>York. He met a few merry, attractive girls,
</p>
<p>now and then, and felt the impulse to be

<p>friendly with them, but his work had en-
</p>
<p>188 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>grossed him more than women. Because of
</p>
<p>it, his way had led more in the misery and pit-
</p>
<p>falls of certain phases of city life and at too
</p>
<p>close range to be attracted by mere froth and
</p>
<p>glitter. And yet he had never felt the neces-
</p>
<p>sity of rolling in the gutter to make sure
</p>
<p>there was one, though it was an idea that had
</p>
<p>obsessed a-plenty of his colleagues. As man
</p>
<p>and boy he had lived cleanly, enthusiastically,
</p>
<p>with high courage for himself and always a
</p>
<p>helping hand for others.
</p>
<p>But now this interest in Margaret Holt
</p>
<p>had won complete possession of him. Was
</p>
<p>it just sympathy that made this tugging at
</p>
<p>his heartstrings? Or he laughed as he
</p>
<p>asked himself the question had he fallen in
</p>
<p>love with the girl? "Great Scott ! I believe
</p>
<p>I am really getting dippy!" he told himself.
</p>
<p>"Go easy, Jack!"

</p>
<p>first instalment of Clavering's new serial
</p>
<p>entitled "The Morton Mystery."
</p>
<p>Jack's heart hammered in his throat.
</p>
<p>"Jupiter!" he exclaimed. "He's at it al-
</p>
<p>ready." Eagerly he skimmed the sensa-
</p>
<p>tional paragraphs of this hectic brain. Yes,

<p>here was Clavering's familiar method the

<p>circumstances, even the proper names trans-
</p>
<p>ferred from the news columns into the chap-

<p>ters of his perfervid fiction. The heroine of

<p>the story was a young girl named Mary

<p>190 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>When her employer had left the room, with the
</p>
<p>crouching, stealthy step of a panther this beau-
</p>
<p>tiful young girl went to his desk where she made
</p>
<p>a hasty search through his papers. But alas !
</p>
<p>Her search was fruitless. She reeled from the
</p>
<p>shock of disappointment. She clutched at the
</p>
<p>collar of her dress. "I must find it! I must!"
</p>
<p>she gasped. Then in the hall she heard the sound
</p>
<p>of his returning footsteps. With the quickness of
</p>
<p>a cat she resumed her work at the type-writer, and
</p>
<p>greeted her employer upon his entrance with a
</p>
<p>lovely smile, little dreaming that behind the glit-
</p>
<p>ter of those hard, cold eyes the serpent of suspi-
</p>
<p>cion was beginning to uncoil and raise its hissing
</p>
<p>head.
</p>
<p>Howell sat spell-bound. What mysteri-
</p>
<p>ous power directed the novelist's brain?
</p>
<p>How much nearer to the truth would it lead
</p>
<p>him now? He thought of poor Margaret
</p>
<p>taking this story down from Clavering's dic-
</p>
<p>tation, and had fear for her. Would she
</p>
<p>betray herself? She had been in perilous
</p>
<p>places before and had emerged triumphant,
</p>
<p>but would she endure this last ordeal?

<p>raged furiously with impatience. "Have
</p>
<p>you nothing at all to tell me yet, Andy?" he
</p>
<p>demanded, when Rivers came to make his
</p>
<p>usual report.
</p>
<p>The ex-reporter gave a discouraged shake
</p>
<p>of his head.
</p>
<p>"Nothing doing!" he said gruffly. "I
</p>
<p>wouldn't stay in that blasted hole another
</p>
<p>minute if it wasn't for the pigeons."
</p>
<p>"Pigeons?" demanded Jack. "What
</p>
<p>pigeons?"
</p>
<p>"Well, you see it's just this way," said
</p>
<p>Andy. "I've watched that house now for
</p>
<p>nearly two weeks, till my nerves are so
</p>
<p>shaky that I want to yell if any one looks up
</p>
<p>at my window, and not a living soul have I
</p>
<p>seen, man, woman or child, stir in or out of
</p>
<p>that house yet."
</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, yes, but what about the
</p>
<p>pigeons?"
</p>
<p>"Well, I've noticed that for the last three
</p>
<p>days now a flock of pigeons have lighted on

</p>
<p>"I don't quite get you," said Jack.
</p>
<p>"Some one is feeding those birds there or
</p>
<p>they wouldn't come so regularly. From
</p>
<p>where I am I can't get the right angle on
</p>
<p>that window to see really just what is hap-
</p>
<p>pening."
</p>
<p>Howell gave a whoop of joy and seized
</p>
<p>Andy by the shoulders. "Have you tried
</p>
<p>the roof?"
</p>
<p>"Not yet. You see I didn't get wise to
</p>
<p>the pigeon gag until to-day."
</p>
<p>Howell was fairly shaking with excite-

<p>ment. "Look here, Andy, you shift with

<p>Mr. Wilson to-morrow; let him take your

<p>place."
</p>
<p>"All right!" agreed Rivers cheerfully,

<p>who felt like welcoming any change in the

<p>monotony of his employment. "But get

</p>
<p>THE OTHER STORY
</p>
<p>THE queer old clock on Winthrop Claver-
</p>
<p>ing's mantel struck the half hour.
</p>
<p>"Half-past four," growled the novelist,
</p>
<p>"and I've been at it since five this morning;
</p>
<p>and this chapter is not finished yet. I tell
</p>
<p>you it must be done to-night. What's the
</p>
<p>last I gave you?"
</p>
<p>He looked impatiently at Margaret Holt,
</p>
<p>who for the twelve hours had been recording
</p>
<p>a narrative so like her own experiences that
</p>
<p>it seemed to her the curious old man there
</p>
<p>must actually have some occult power of
</p>
<p>divination; she felt as if he were plucking
</p>
<p>threads from her inmost mind out of which
</p>
<p>to weave his terrible story. But she
</p>
<p>whipped her tired brain to obedience again.
</p>
<p>"Read it! Can't you? Read it!" went
</p>
<p>on Clavering querulously.

<p>She hesitated a moment over her short-
</p>
<p>hand notes, and then read:
</p>
<p>"The time had come to fulfil her desper-
</p>
<p>ate mission. It was now or never !"
</p>
<p>"No, no! that won't do! Cross it out!
</p>
<p>What's the matter with my brain this after-
</p>
<p>noon?" The author actually whined as he
</p>
<p>paced the floor, trying by physical exertion
</p>
<p>to stir the sluggard imp of his inspira-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>"You have been working a long time,"
</p>
<p>suggested Margaret, inwardly praying for
</p>
<p>some cessation of her nerve-racking work.
</p>
<p>"Only twelve hours. My God! Have I
</p>
<p>the brain of a jelly fish?"
</p>
<p>Back and forth, back and forth he raged,
</p>
<p>but still the thoughts refused to flow.
</p>
<p>"H'm," he growled, "I'll go take my walk
</p>
<p>now instead of later."
</p>
<p>He doffed his black skull cap, changed his
</p>
<p>shiny, dressing jacket for a shinier coat,
</p>
<p>struggled into his cape-coat, and jamming

<p>out of the room and down the stairs. The
</p>
<p>THE OTHER STORY 195
</p>
<p>exhausted amanuensis gave a great sigh of
</p>
<p>relief as she heard the peg, peg of his stout
</p>
<p>walking stick die away. Now at least she
</p>
<p>could have a little air and rest.
</p>
<p>She turned out the light, then went to the
</p>
<p>windows and threw them open wide, leaning
</p>
<p>against the casement and looking out upon
</p>
<p>the lighted street. Mentally and physic-
</p>
<p>ally weary, too weary even to fear, she told
</p>
<p>herself, for ten days she had endured an
</p>
<p>agony of mind that was beginning now to
</p>
<p>produce a sense of numbness in her brain.
</p>
<p>It was her story that Clavering was writing
</p>
<p>hers. The incidents he used were never
</p>
<p>identically like the facts, yet they came so
</p>
<p>near the truth that sometimes it took all her
</p>
<p>power to crush back the sob of terror that
</p>
<p>forced itself to her lips.
</p>
<p>How much longer could she hold out, she
</p>
<p>wondered dully. Not only the mental strain
</p>
<p>was telling on her, but the confinement, too,
</p>
<p>the long hours of work in the smoke-fogged
</p>
<p>room, were sapping her vitality.

</p>
<p>From sheer weakness she slipped down
</p>
<p>196 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>on the floor, and rested there by the window,
</p>
<p>leaning her head against its sill. The night
</p>
<p>air blowing in cooled her feverish eyes and
</p>
<p>head. She never dared approach the win-
</p>
<p>dow in the day time lest some one in the
</p>
<p>street might see and recognise her. When
</p>
<p>old Martha, the housekeeper, entered the
</p>
<p>room a few minutes later she found her
</p>
<p>there still asleep.
</p>
<p>"Po' chile!" she muttered. "Fas' asleep.
</p>
<p>Dat ole debble gwine to kill her wif work."
</p>
<p>Martha liked the new stenographer better
</p>
<p>than any of the others that had so far had
</p>
<p>the ill fortune to work for Clavering.
</p>
<p>"You's de bes' of de ladies dat has had dis

</p>
<p>sleeping girl. "Yo' ain't got none ob dose
</p>
<p>high heel notions like dem."
</p>
<p>Placing a tray of food upon the table, she
</p>
<p>went and closed the windows, for the air had
</p>
<p>grown chill. The sound roused Margaret
</p>
<p>with a start; the room was so dark she
</p>
<p>thought she must have slept far into the

</p>

</p>
<p>coloured woman bending over her, and knew
</p>
<p>again where she was.
</p>
<p>"What time is it, Martha? It's you, is
</p>
<p>it?" she sighed.
</p>
<p>"Going on to five o'clock in de ebening,
</p>
<p>Missy."
</p>
<p>"I must have fallen asleep," said Mar-
</p>
<p>garet.
</p>
<p>"And a blessed good thing, too," replied
</p>
<p>Martha sympathetically. "You don't get
</p>
<p>enuff sleep, Honey."
</p>
<p>"No, I don't sleep very much; that's
</p>
<p>true. Has Mr. Clavering returned yet?"
</p>
<p>"No," said Martha. "Not yet. I heered

<p>twenty minutes ago, an' I just slipped up

</p>
<p>disapproved if there were any irregularities
</p>
<p>at meal-time.

<p>Margaret shook her head. "We've been
</p>
<p>at it all day," she said.

</p>
<p>"Mr. Clavering has to write when the
</p>
<p>spirit moves him, you know," said Margaret.
</p>
<p>"Huh," grunted the disgusted Martha.
</p>
<p>"De spirit ought t' mobe him a long way
</p>
<p>off, I say."
</p>
<p>She placed a chair before the tray.
</p>
<p>"Come now, Honey, jes' yo' take a bite,"
</p>
<p>she urged. "There ain't nuthin' passed yo'

</p>
<p>Margaret seated herself and made an at-
</p>
<p>tempt at eating.
</p>
<p>There was but a dim light in the room and
</p>
<p>the hands in the prints that lined the walls
</p>
<p>seemed weirdly stretching out their fingers
</p>
<p>to grasp hers. The girl shuddered. "Turn
</p>
<p>on all the lights, please, Martha, and draw

</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, it is the new story," assented
</p>
<p>Margaret with a nervous shudder.
</p>
<p>" 'Bout dat Morton murder, ain't it?"
</p>
<p>"Yes, I believe he is founding it on the
</p>
<p>Morton murder," said Margaret, tremu-
</p>
<p>lously.
</p>
<p>"Massa Claverin' kin certainly write

<p>about murders," commented Martha. "He
</p>
<p>used to make me listen t' his stories till I got
</p>
<p>so doff goned nervous dat I use t' jump at

</p>
<p>shuddered elaborately as she bent to pick up
</p>
<p>some of the many papers scattered about
</p>
<p>her master's desk.
</p>
<p>Margaret had been trying to eat her toast
</p>
<p>in vain. "Martha, please take the tray
</p>
<p>away. I can't eat," she said pleadingly.
</p>
<p>The coloured woman looked at her pale
</p>
<p>face anxiously. "Why don't yo' run out an'
</p>
<p>take a little walk, Honey? Yo' ain't been

<p>"I must be here, ready to take Mr. Claver-

<p>"De roses is fading in yo' cheeks, Honey,"

<p>An imperative ring at the bell interrupted

<p>the flow of words. "Now who can dat be?"

<p>speculated Martha.
</p>
<p>The sound and the old negress's last words
</p>
<p>had sent a touch of colour to Margaret's
</p>
<p>pale face. Perhaps it was Howell again
</p>
<p>with some news of Victor. Howell had
</p>
<p>been the only person to ring that bell since
</p>
<p>she had come to this queer house. Again
</p>
<p>came a peel that echoed through the hall.
</p>
<p>"Hurry!" she called to Martha.

<p>The negress gathered up the tray. "If

<p>eager voice rose to her as he parleyed with

<p>the obdurate housekeeper. "No, yo' can't

<p>"Massa Clavering done tole ma neber to let

</p>
<p>"Is that so, Sappho? Well, take this and

</p>
<p>Next moment Martha's voice rose again
</p>
<p>in a pretended grumble.
</p>
<p>"Well, you come in, but," she added with
</p>
<p>a chuckle, "remember you bust right in

</p>
<p>And indeed Howell was up the stairs in

<p>a bound and grasped Margaret's out-

<p>stretched hands in the study while the old

<p>mammy was still expostulating.

<p>As the door closed behind them, Jack
</p>
<p>could see that the poor girl was shivering so

<p>204 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>a little sobbing cry she leaned her head
</p>
<p>against his shoulder, her body shaken by a
</p>
<p>perfect paroxysm of sobs. At first Jack
</p>
<p>made no effort to quiet her, thinking that the
</p>
<p>storm of emotion at last would ease the
</p>
<p>strain; just once he bent and touched her
</p>
<p>hair with his lips very tenderly.
</p>
<p>When her sobs grew fainter he began to
</p>
<p>talk to her. He was very gentle, but she
</p>
<p>felt his strength lifting her with every
</p>
<p>cheery word. "Come now, Margaret," he
</p>
<p>said. "Steady, now. You're not going to
</p>
<p>give out now, you know."
</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Howell," she pleaded, "I can't
</p>
<p>go on. I can't go on."
</p>
<p>Howell turned to her quickly, "Can't go
</p>
<p>on?" he asked. "Why? What has hap-
</p>
<p>pened?"
</p>
<p>"Oh, everything! That awful old man!
</p>
<p>He's so dreadful!"
</p>
<p>"Clavering!" he cried, his hands clenched.
</p>
<p>"Has he insulted you?"

<p>canny, terrifying. He has brought it up
</p>
<p>now to the very day of the murder, and
</p>
<p>nearly everything that he says is true. I
</p>
<p>don't know how he knows! To-night he
</p>
<p>will begin the chapter of the murder. How
</p>
<p>can I sit there calmly and take down his
</p>
<p>dictation? I shall betray myself! I tell
</p>
<p>you it is driving me mad!" A terrified ex-
</p>
<p>citement lighted her strained face and her
</p>
<p>great eyes burned feverishly.
</p>
<p>Howell took her two hands in his and
</p>
<p>spoke again, almost sternly. "Steady now,
</p>
<p>Margaret! It may not last much longer.
</p>
<p>I have some news for you."
</p>
<p>His voice and the import of his words
</p>
<p>quieted her at once. "Some word from
</p>
<p>Victor?" she questioned tremulously.
</p>
<p>"Not that! But I think that I may have
</p>
<p>soon," he said. Then in hurried words he
</p>
<p>told her of his discovery of the house and the
</p>
<p>pigeons. She listened breathlessly, cling-
</p>
<p>ing to his hand unheedingly. "Your Uncle

</p>
<p>your brother understands from Wilson's
</p>
<p>signal that he is to get a message to us

</p>
<p>The girl's face became transfigured with
</p>
<p>the light of this new hope. "Victor! Then
</p>
<p>he is alive ! Thank God ! Oh, thank God 1"
</p>
<p>she cried.
</p>
<p>"And is Uncle Mark watching the house
</p>
<p>now?" she questioned eagerly.
</p>
<p>"You bet he is," said Jack. "He is a
</p>
<p>game old boy, Nunky. He'll spot any mes-
</p>
<p>sage that comes through, I tell you. We
</p>
<p>must not make a move until we get that mes-

<p>sage. Now, don't you worry!" he added,
</p>
<p>the tenderness creeping into his voice
</p>
<p>again.
</p>
<p>"But meanwhile they may kill him," ex-
</p>
<p>claimed Margaret.
</p>
<p>"No, 'Your brother is safe as long as noth-

<p>Headquarters with 'that stenographer' yet,
</p>
<p>you know, from the beginning."
</p>
<p>"I know! I knowl He would have no
</p>
<p>mercy," Margaret cried. "None!"
</p>
<p>"Well," said Jack, "that's hard to say
</p>
<p>about the old curmudgeon. He may have
</p>
<p>some bowels of compassion. On the other
</p>
<p>hand you may be quite right. He might

<p>take you to Headquarters with a brass band

<p>heading the procession. He might give up

<p>his own mother to satisfy his vanity. The

</p>
<p>"What can we do?" pleaded Margaret.
</p>
<p>"Get you out of here," he answered
</p>
<p>promptly. "That's one thing we must do."
</p>
<p>"Oh, thank God you think so!" cried poor
</p>
<p>Margaret.
</p>
<p>"I have been thinking so ever since I read

<p>Jack, "and now I've made up my mind defi-

<p>garet. Her face, which had been pale,
</p>
<p>flooded rosy with colour. "Oh, you should
</p>
<p>not have done that. It was not safe."
</p>
<p>"Now listen to me, Margaret," Jack said
</p>
<p>quietly. "Your story is as safe with my
</p>
<p>mother as with the sphinx. She's the best

<p>little mother in the world, too." His voice
</p>
<p>broke for a moment as he went on: "Her
</p>
<p>arms are waiting to take you in just as if
</p>
<p>you were her own little girl." He saw the
</p>
<p>tumult of emotion his words had caused and
</p>
<p>hurried on: "Mother has a little house
</p>
<p>down in Jersey which she is going to open,"
</p>
<p>he explained. "She will take you there and
</p>
<p>keep you till we have your brother safe and

<p>success; "And we'll do it now, too, don't
</p>
<p>you fear."

<p>her hands and shuddered at the thought.

</p>
<p>Jack gave an answering exclamation of hor-
</p>
<p>ror. "My dear child," he cried, "have you
</p>
<p>had that on your mind with all the rest?
</p>
<p>Why, don't you know you have but to tell

<p>Promise me you will not let yourself think of

</p>
<p>"I promise," she said, smiling wanly.

<p>She held out both hands to him. "Why are

<p>see?" pleaded Jack.

<p>"Do you think I'm a scoundrel? I want

</p>
<p>She looked up into his face with eyes of
</p>
<p>wondering misery. "Have you forgotten?"
</p>
<p>she whispered to him.
</p>
<p>"Forgotten!" he repeated. His lips
</p>
<p>twisted into a strange smile. "My God!
</p>
<p>Can I ever forget? There are moments
</p>
<p>when, if I could dig my fingers into the
</p>
<p>throat of any cur that so much as laid a fin-
</p>
<p>ger on you there is no awful, bloody, man-
</p>
<p>gling thing I would not do to him."
</p>
<p>His face was ghastly under its tan, his
</p>
<p>eyes aflame. A little cry came from Mar-
</p>
<p>garet's lips, and he turned away quickly,
</p>
<p>saying with a rough laugh: "Oh, I guess
</p>
<p>I'm the original cave-man all right, when it
</p>
<p>comes to avenging the woman I love."
</p>
<p>The girl, with a pitiful attempt at light-
</p>
<p>ness in her voice laid her hand on his shoul-
</p>
<p>der, mimicking: "Steady, Jack! Steady
</p>
<p>now."
</p>
<p>For reply he drew her tender fluttering
</p>
<p>hand down and held it firm in his. "Mar-
</p>
<p>garet, do you love me?" he demanded.

</p>
<p>fiercely.
</p>
<p>"No, no, no!" she denied, in a very pas-
</p>
<p>sion of expostulation.
</p>
<p>"Then why?" demanded Jack again. "Is
</p>
<p>it that you can't care for me, you think?"
</p>
<p>"I must not care for you; you must not
</p>
<p>ask me," said Margaret.

<p>"Why?"

</p>
<p>bravely. "I put all thought of love and

<p>ago."

<p>"Margaret!" cried Jack. "Do you

<p>Fourth Street. I watched until I saw a

<p>hand thrust through the bars of that window
</p>
<p>there, and make a motion of dropping some-
</p>
<p>thing. Then I made my way as rapidly as
</p>
<p>possible to the street again. A lot of ur-
</p>
<p>chins had collected in front of the empty

<p>house, and were looking at something in the
</p>
<p>hand of one of them. They talked and kept

<p>looking upward, as though what they'd

<p>found had dropped from the sky. 'What

</p>
<p>A moment's hasty, trembling search,
</p>
<p>then Margaret read: "Will lower. Will
</p>
<p>lower?" She looked at the reporter ques-
</p>
<p>tioningly.
</p>
<p>"Don't you get it? Don't you see?" cried
</p>
<p>Jack. "He will lower that cord at dusk."
</p>
<p>His eyes were blazing and his face grew
</p>
<p>crimson with excitement. "Am I a sleuth!
</p>
<p>Are we sleuths, you and I?" he almost
</p>
<p>shouted. Then he pointed to the window.
</p>
<p>"Look, it is long after dusk now. Perhaps

<p>the cord is there already. I'll get a return

<p>"But you'll be careful," cautioned Mar-
</p>
<p>garet, "won't you? Remember there's dan-
</p>
<p>ger?"
</p>
<p>"Oh, hell with danger! Oh, my dear, I
</p>
<p>beg your pardon," he added contritely.
</p>
<p>Snatching a piece of paper he hastily
</p>
<p>scribbled, reading aloud as he wrote:
</p>
<p>"Friends are watching. How strongly
</p>
<p>guarded? Strike match at window when
</p>
<p>ready to return answer."
</p>
<p>He folded the paper and put it in his
</p>
<p>pocket, then turned to Margaret again.
</p>
<p>"There! He'll be wise to that. Now keep
</p>
<p>your nerve, little girl, until to-night. Re-
</p>
<p>member, I'm with you." He caught her
</p>
<p>hands in his and laid his lips on them, un-
</p>
<p>rebufFed. "Margaret, you are not to forget
</p>
<p>what I said to you," he commanded. "Re-
</p>
<p>member!"
</p>
<p>Again the wonderful smile flashed in her
</p>
<p>eyes. "I'm only afraid it's you that may
</p>
<p>want me to forget," she said.

<p>He held her hands as in a vise, and his face

<p>was grim with determination as he answered,
</p>
<p>huskily: "You must believe me, whatever
</p>

</p>
<p>The slamming of the front door and the
</p>
<p>peg-peg of a walking stick in the hall froze
</p>
<p>the words on his lips. "Is that Clavering?"
</p>
<p>he asked Margaret, hurriedly, as he saw her
</p>
<p>face turn white and her eyes grow large with
</p>
<p>apprehension.
</p>
<p>"Yes! Yes! That awful man. I'm
</p>
<p>terrified at the very sound of his feet," she
</p>
<p>breathed.
</p>
<p>"Courage!" Jack whispered to her.
</p>
<p>"You must not give way now. Remember
</p>
<p>what it means. Remember that we are
</p>
<p>working to save Victor, and that he will get
</p>
<p>a message to us to-night."
</p>
<p>At his words her faltering spirit rallied.
</p>
<p>"I'll try, oh, I'll try," she whispered back;
</p>
<p>"I will do my very best."
</p>
<p>An angry roar at the door made them

<p>TO BE CONTINUED 221
</p>
<p>garet vindictively, furious at this invasion
</p>
<p>of his sanctum, sanctorum. He directed an
</p>
<p>annihilating glance at Howell too, who was
</p>
<p>making desperate attempts to meet the situ-
</p>
<p>ation with placid unconcern so far as Mar-
</p>
<p>garet was concerned.
</p>
<p>"Now get into your reverse, and back up,
</p>
<p>Little Nemo," he taunted, trying to draw
</p>
<p>the novelist's fire upon himself.
</p>
<p>"Don't call me Little Nemo!" Clavering
</p>
<p>roared, shaking his cane at Howell threaten-
</p>
<p>ingly. "What business have you here in
</p>
<p>my house, anyway, I should like to know?
</p>
<p>I told that black devil never to allow any one
</p>
<p>up here. Any one! Get out! And you,"
</p>
<p>he added, turning to the trembling girl,
</p>
<p>"You get to work! No feller, indeed!"
</p>
<p>With a final outburst he shambled off into
</p>
<p>his bedroom to change his coat.
</p>
<p>Howell hurriedly approached Margaret
</p>
<p>again. "I will get you out of here some
</p>
<p>way to-night," he whispered. "Don't

<p>fear!"

</p>
<p>"No. He must not know. He'd raise a

<p>row. What time does the old dub sleep?"
</p>
<p>"He never sleeps," sighed Margaret.
</p>
<p>"Could you get out about nine o'clock?"
</p>
<p>persisted Jack.
</p>
<p>"Yes; I can and I will," replied Mar-
</p>
<p>garet with determination, ready to take any
</p>
<p>chance now that should free her from the
</p>
<p>strain of Clavering's dictation.
</p>
<p>"Then meet me half way down the block
</p>
<p>at nine," said Jack. "I will be there
</p>
<p>with a taxi." He broke off abruptly and
</p>
<p>commenced whistling an airy bit from "The
</p>
<p>Pink Lady" as Clavering came back into the
</p>
<p>room.
</p>
<p>"You here yet?" exclaimed the criminolo-
</p>
<p>gist irascibly. "Can't you find the door?
</p>
<p>There it is. And when you leave take the
</p>
<p>stairs up with you, so you can't come back."
</p>
<p>The reporter gave no sign of perturba-

<p>tioned. "Just wait till you hear why I

</p>
<p>"Oh, guess again," said Jack.
</p>
<p>"Then why?" asked Clavering. "The
</p>
<p>devil knows I didn't invite you. I wouldn't
</p>
<p>deprive him of your company," he chuckled,
</p>
<p>his little eyes twinkling malevolently. He
</p>
<p>turned to the mirror to adjust his black
</p>
<p>skull-cap.
</p>
<p>"The Sunday Editor told me to call and
</p>
<p>ask if you can have your next chapter ready
</p>
<p>for Saturday," said Jack.
</p>
<p>"I don't know whether I can or not,"
</p>
<p>snapped Clavering. "You can tell your
</p>
<p>Sunday Editor that he'll have it when I get
</p>
<p>it good and ready, and if he sends you here
</p>
<p>again he won't get it at all. My brains are

</p>

<p>canned and put on the market as an after

<p>slammed the door and departed. Margaret

<p>vainly on his table.
</p>
<p>"Martha was here a little while ago; per-

<p>haps she knows," suggested Margaret.
</p>
<p>"Oh, she never knows anything. She
</p>
<p>never did and she never will know any-
</p>
<p>thing," he sputtered. He went to the head
</p>
<p>of the stairs and called her. "Martha!
</p>
<p>Martha!" he yelled. "Come up here!"
</p>
<p>Hasty shuffling foot-steps sounded on the
</p>
<p>stairs as the poor negress obeyed her mas-
</p>
<p>ter's imperative summons. "Yas, sir! I'se
</p>
<p>a comin', I'se a comin'," she panted.
</p>
<p>"Well, stop coming and get here," he
</p>
<p>shouted back. Then in a moment he re-
</p>
<p>lapsed into a whining tone. "Everything
</p>
<p>to disturb me to-day. Don't do that!" he
</p>
<p>snarled at Margaret, who was sharpening
</p>
<p>her pencil.
</p>
<p>Martha entered, puffing from the effort
</p>
<p>of her hasty ascent of two flights of stairs.
</p>
<p>"Did yo' call me, sah?" she asked.

<p>"Don't shriek at me," complained Claver-

<p>ing petulantly. "And why did you let that

<p>never to allow any one in this house?

<p>With a little silent prayer for courage to
</p>
<p>go on, Margaret began to read her notes.

<p>" 'For a thrilling moment the woman

<p>stood silent, motionless. She could scarcely

<p>reached her waiting ears.' '
</p>
<p>"Waiting ears," repeated Clavering.
</p>
<p>"Waiting ears. Now let's see."

<p>He paused a moment, picturing in his

<p>mind the room at the Beaumont, no slightest
</p>
<p>detail of which had escaped his ferret-like
</p>
<p>eyes on his visit to it that memorable after-

<p>"The door to Morton's bedroom was over

<p>which the stenographer worked there; and

<p>"Why? Good Lord! Haven't you
</p>
<p>heard me go over it times enough to know?"
</p>
<p>he inquired testily. "Oh, all you think of is

<p>getting your salary, I suppose." Then he
</p>
<p>began pacing up and down the well-worn

<p>track on the faded red carpet, repeating to
</p>
<p>himself: "Listening ears. Listening ears.

<p>gether with a resounding smack "Tide.

<p>and have it cold too, do you hear?" he
</p>
<p>shouted out into the hall.
</p>
<p>"Yes, sah!" came up the response from
</p>
<p>the nether regions.
</p>
<p>"Rather thrilling, that last chapter, I
</p>
<p>think," he remarked to Margaret, in a tone
</p>
<p>of self-gratulation. "Knew that I could
</p>
<p>make a story of that Morton murder, soon
</p>
<p>as I heard it. It's all true, too. Ha! If
</p>
<p>the police would only read my stories in-
</p>
<p>stead of following up senseless clues they
</p>
<p>might catch that woman easily. Might
</p>
<p>catch her myself, eh? And show 'em there's
</p>
<p>a little air left in 'that flat tire' yet." Evi-
</p>
<p>dently Captain Ryan's words still rankled
</p>
<p>in his soul. "Maybe I'll catch her yet,
</p>
<p>maybe I shall," he mused as he paced the
</p>
<p>floor of the study back and forth.
</p>
<p>"Catch her! Catch her!" the words
</p>
<p>burned themselves still deeper into Mar-
</p>
<p>garet's brain as with shaking fingers she tried
</p>
<p>to type out the last of Clavering's chapter.

</p>
<p>a disgusted sniff at the smoke-laden atmos-
</p>
<p>phere.
</p>
<p>Clavering took the papers and settled
</p>
<p>down in his chair to search their pages.
</p>
<p>"What's this?" he exclaimed. Excitedly
</p>
<p>he began to read aloud : ' 'PLAN TO STOP

<p>space for a moment, then continued:

<p>'The blowing up of the house at 17 Grand
</p>
<p>Street on December first and the killing
</p>
<p>of twelve Italians! Huh! Black Hand
</p>
<p>stuff! No interest in that!"
</p>
<p>At the next item Margaret's heart
</p>
<p>stopped beating for a moment, then gal-
</p>
<p>loped on like a race-horse: "'Murder of
</p>
<p>James Morton at the Hotel Beaumont' "
</p>
<p>Clavering sat bolt upright and scanned the
</p>
<p>lines again intently. "What do you think
</p>
<p>of that?" he ejaculated.
</p>
<p>"Of what?" inquired the girl with as-
</p>
<p>sumed curiosity.
</p>
<p>"Five hundred dollars offered for the ar-
</p>
<p>rest of that stenographer."
</p>
<p>"What stenographer?"
</p>
<p>"Why, the one who killed James Mor-
</p>
<p>ton. The woman we've been writing

<p>about," Clavering explained, looking at her
</p>
<p>shrewdly.

<p>the reward in advertising alone !" His colour
</p>
<p>rose in his cheeks and his eyes glittered.
</p>
<p>"I ought to be able to catch that girl!
</p>
<p>What's my imagination worth if I can't work

<p>He caught up the paper again and read:

<p>that'll come too! That'll come! I never

<p>knew how the Priest's assassin got away
</p>
<p>from the church undetected, but I imagined
</p>
<p>that he put on some of the robes he found in
</p>
<p>the vestry; and, by Jupiter, that was the
</p>
<p>very thing he really did. What do you

<p>long, bony finger at Margaret. "Huh!

<p>the danger closing in upon her she could not

<p>Clavering tasted the words upon his lips

<p>like an epicure with an inviting dish. "Got

<p>that?"
</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."
</p>
<p>"Well, then, now: ready." He took his

<p>favourite pose, with one hand resting on the

<p>table, his other outstretched and holding his

<p>pipe, and began his dictation. " 'For a brief

<p>standing there with his back to the bedroom

<p>ing eyes.' '
</p>
<p>He paused to search for a match and Mar-
</p>
<p>garet gave a gasping cry. Clavering heard
</p>
<p>it, and turned quickly to see his assistant
</p>
<p>sitting with her face buried in her trembling
</p>
<p>hands.
</p>
<p>"Why, what's the matter?" he inquired
</p>
<p>fretfully. "You're not sick, are you?"
</p>
<p>Margaret forced a little laugh, desperately
</p>
<p>shaking off the sensation of faintness that
</p>
<p>threatened her. "Oh, no, no, it's nothing.
</p>
<p>Only it was such a tense moment in the story.
</p>
<p>You made it so real that I just felt I must
</p>
<p>scream for the girl." This time the laugh
</p>
<p>was more successfully hysterical.
</p>
<p>For a moment a smile lighted up Claver-
</p>
<p>ing's scowling face. Here was real appre-
</p>
<p>ciation of his genius. None of his other
</p>
<p>stenographers had ever been more than dum-

<p>its gesticulation. " 'For a tense, breathless

<p>But the woman stood her ground, defying

</p>
<p>"No, no! It was not to warn!" cried

<p>Margaret, impelled as if by some hypnotic

<p>power to tell the truth. Too late she real-

<p>ised what she had done, and shrank from the

<p>anger of Clavering's face.
</p>
<p>"How do you know? Am I writing this

<p>"Oh ! You want to be a novelist, do you?"
</p>
<p>he grunted. "Well, be one, and starve 1"
</p>
<p>He stood for a moment trying to pick up
</p>
<p>the thread of his narrative. "What did you
</p>
<p>interrupt me for?" he snarled, helpless until
</p>
<p>his eyes fell upon the telephone on the desk.
</p>
<p>"Oh, I have it! 'He seized the telephone

</p>
<p>did you know her eyes were grey?" she
</p>
<p>stammered.
</p>
<p>"How did I know her eyes were grey?"
</p>
<p>He looked over his spectacles at her. "I
</p>
<p>know it by the study of inclinations. Did

<p>you think I selected the colour at random?
</p>
<p>Brown-eyed people never have self-control

<p>enough to commit desperate deeds. Nor do
</p>
<p>blue-eyed people; nor have they the quick-

<p>ness required in such a crisis as this. She
</p>
<p>had grey eyes," he snapped emphatically.
</p>
<p>He moved a step nearer to the girl and
</p>
<p>peered into her big, startled eyes. "Eyes
</p>
<p>just like yours," he said.
</p>
<p>"Like mine?" she echoed, shrinking back
</p>
<p>from his piercing scrutiny.
</p>
<p>"Yes. She had eyes like yours, and she
</p>
<p>was about your height, too," he added, as
</p>
<p>with a calculating glance he took her meas-

</p>
<p>that !" He made as if he were striking him-
</p>
<p>self above the heart, to illustrate his point.
</p>
<p>Margaret was held as in a spell by his eyes.
</p>
<p>Magnified by the powerful lenses of his spec-
</p>
<p>tacles they seemed to bore into her very mind
</p>
<p>like a drill. He extended his long arm to-
</p>
<p>wards her. "Look here!" he exclaimed, as
</p>
<p>if struck by a sudden thought.
</p>
<p>The girl grew rigid. What was coming?
</p>
<p>Was he going to proclaim her the murderer
</p>
<p>of James Morton then and there?
</p>
<p>"Look here," he said again, "when this
</p>
<p>story is published in book form and the ar-
</p>
<p>tist begins his illustrations I'm going to have
</p>
<p>you pose for him."
</p>
<p>At this sudden drop from tragedy her
</p>
<p>face crimsoned, then went white again; and
</p>
<p>then a sudden impulse seized her to escape
</p>
<p>from his magnetic power. "Mr. Clavering,"
</p>
<p>she called out, "I can't go on with your

</p>

</p>
<p>and sputtered. "What are you talking
</p>
<p>about? Why can't you go on?"
</p>
<p>"For two days now I have had only three
</p>
<p>hours' sleep," she answered tremulously,
</p>
<p>"and I am breaking down under the strain.
</p>
<p>You will have to get some one else. I can't
</p>
<p>go on."
</p>
<p>She turned wearily to the door, as if her
</p>
<p>departure were a thing immediate.
</p>
<p>"Wait a minute!" he cried, catching her
</p>
<p>by the arm. "You mustn't. I can't get
</p>
<p>any one else now. I must finish this chapter

<p>ously, as she shook her head. Then he

<p>cil in her nerveless fingers. He fumbled in
</p>
<p>his pocket and then, as if he were trying to
</p>
<p>soothe an unhappy child, "Have a pepper-

</p>
<p>which he pulled out of a paper bag.

<p>"No, I thank you," she declined mechan-

<p>ically.
</p>
<p>Could she go on till eight o'clock, she won-

<p>dered. She had promised Jack to try. She

<p>must get along with the work. What was

<p>And Margaret's voice was steady again

<p>now as she read : ' 'For an instant, as the

<p>his right side to the table." He put himself
</p>
<p>in the imaginary position, raising the tele-
</p>
<p>phone on his desk in his left hand, "with the
</p>
<p>'phone like this," he added. Then as he felt
</p>
<p>the situation grow he turned to Margaret
</p>
<p>and commanded : "Come here !"
</p>
<p>Slowly, as if drawn to him against her will,
</p>
<p>she obeyed his summons.
</p>
<p>"Now we'll suppose that you are the
</p>
<p>woman, standing there," he said excitedly,
</p>
<p>not noticing her shudder at his words. He
</p>
<p>took a long dagger-like paper knife from his
</p>
<p>desk. "Here, take that," he commanded,
</p>
<p>and placed it in her hand.

<p>and bite her lips; nevertheless she did what
</p>
<p>she was told to do.
</p>
<p>"Now where would you strike me?" Clav-
</p>
<p>ering asked her, as though he were a surgeon
</p>
<p>lecturing at a clinic.
</p>
<p>"Where? ... I ..."
</p>
<p>She raised her arm with the knife gripped
</p>
<p>in her hand, then with an exclamation of hor-
</p>
<p>ror threw the shining thing far from her, and
</p>
<p>reeled backward almost fainting.
</p>
<p>Clavering caught her in his arms.
</p>
<p>"Why, what's the matter? How white
</p>
<p>you are! What ails you?" he cried out.
</p>
<p>"It's nothing, nothing," she protested
</p>
<p>eagerly. "It's only that you are making it
</p>
<p>so real."
</p>
<p>"Of course I make it real," he said.
</p>
<p>"That's why people read my stories. But
</p>
<p>for God's sake don't faint," he pleaded as
</p>
<p>he helped her to the table. "We can't spare
</p>
<p>the time. I like to dictate to you. you feel
</p>
<p>things so." Again he thrust the pencil be-
</p>
<p>tween her fingers. "Come on, now," he

<p>asm; "I'm just beginning to feel this my-

</p>
<p>He stopped and picked up the paper knife
</p>
<p>from the floor where it had fallen. "Now
</p>
<p>get this," he began " 'With a sudden im-
</p>
<p>pulse she clutched the handle of the stiletto,
</p>
<p>and plunged it deep into his villainous

</p>
<p>But at this critical moment the door-bell
</p>
<p>rang persistently.
</p>
<p>"Thank God!" Margaret ejaculated so
</p>
<p>fervently that Clavering turned upon her
</p>
<p>with an angry scowl.
</p>
<p>"What's the matter now!" he demanded.
</p>
<p>"The door-bell rang," she said weakly.
</p>
<p>"Well, let it ring," he shouted. "Where
</p>
<p>were we?" He tried in vain to recover the
</p>
<p>interrupted thought. "Now you've thrown
</p>
<p>me off again," he complained peevishly.
</p>
<p>He looked at the paper knife in his hand and
</p>

<p>"Tap, tap," came from some one at the
</p>
<p>door.
</p>
<p>"There's some one knocking," Margaret
</p>
<p>said to him.
</p>
<p>"I don't care if there is!" bellowed the
</p>
<p>frantic author. "I don't intend to be dis-

<p>"There it goes again," he almost cried.
</p>
<p>"Shall I see who it is?" persisted the girl.
</p>
<p>"No! Sit down. I won't be bothered,"
</p>
<p>he thundered. ' 'Plunged it deep into his
</p>
<p>villainous heart,' " he repeated at the top of
</p>
<p>his voice, as if to drown out any other sound.
</p>
<p>The knocking at the door sounded again
</p>
<p>more loudly. "Oh, pshaw!" he groaned
</p>
<p>despairingly, dropping his arm to his sides.
</p>
<p>"How can I concentrate my thoughts with

<p>Clavering gripped the knife in his hand
</p>
<p>and strode to the door. "What do you

<p>want?" he cried, flourishing the knife
</p>
<p>above her head. "You black chimpanzee!

</p>
<p>"She wrote something on dis yere card,"
</p>
<p>persisted Martha. "She said to give it to

<p>you and you'd see her sure."
</p>
<p>Clavering snatched the card, which had a
</p>
<p>deep mourning border, from Martha's hand.
</p>
<p>"Let me see it," he said, and as he looked at
</p>
<p>it Margaret saw his shaggy eyebrows rise in
</p>
<p>an expression of keen surprise. "Is she
</p>
<p>down stairs?" he asked.
</p>
<p>"Yes, sah," said Martha.
</p>
<p>"I'll see her. But tell her to think of what

<p>shuffled out and down the stairs.

<p>More than ever with a sense of impending

<p>outside the door. She must get to her room

</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVI
</p>
<p>A RELATIVE OF THE LATE JAMES MORTON
</p>
<p>IT was a very sable draped figure, the face
</p>
<p>concealed by a heavy crepe veil, that Martha
</p>
<p>conducted into Clavering's study a moment
</p>
<p>later. The housekeeper stood in open-
</p>
<p>mouthed wonder watching the woman as she
</p>
<p>glided into the room. Her curiosity was
</p>
<p>nipped short by her employer calling sharply
</p>
<p>to her: "Well, are you a relative of James
</p>
<p>Morton too?"
</p>
<p>"No, sah, no, sah," stammered Martha.
</p>
<p>"I ain't never had no relatives like dat."
</p>
<p>"Then get out," was the testy command.
</p>
<p>"Yes, sah," answered Martha, closing the
</p>
<p>door as slowly as she could, to get another
</p>
<p>look at the black spectre.
</p>
<p>Before addressing his mysterious visitor,
</p>
<p>Clavering looked her over from head to foot

</p>
<p>with a scrutinising stare. "You want to
</p>
<p>see me?" he asked curtly. "Well, then, be
</p>
<p>quick. I've only a few minutes to spare for
</p>
<p>you."
</p>
<p>"You are Mister Clavering?" began the
</p>
<p>woman.
</p>
<p>"You know I am," he snapped. "There's
</p>
<p>a minute wasted asking that! You wrote
</p>
<p>on this that you were a relative of the late
</p>
<p>James Morton who was murdered at the
</p>
<p>Hotel Beaumont."
</p>
<p>The woman took a cautious look about the
</p>
<p>room before replying, "Si, Senor."
</p>
<p>"Senor?" Clavering raised his eyebrows.
</p>
<p>"Oh, you're a Spaniard, are you?"
</p>
<p>"Yes. My name is Juanita Perez."
</p>
<p>She gave another look at the doors as she
</p>
<p>inquired in an eager voice, "You speak
</p>
<p>Espagnol?"
</p>
<p>"No, no, but you need not be afraid," he
</p>
<p>answered, noticing the nervous shifting of
</p>
<p>her head. "Raise that veil. I can't talk

</p>
<p>She hesitated a moment, then threw back
</p>
<p>the thick crepe.
</p>
<p>"Ah!" ejaculated Clavering. "Yes, I
</p>
<p>can see that you are a Spaniard. And
</p>
<p>you're a relative of Morton's, are you?" He
</p>
<p>brought his hand down upon the table with
</p>
<p>a thump of satisfaction. "I said in the be-
</p>
<p>ginning he was a Spaniard, or an Italian;
</p>
<p>and I was right." His little eyes began to
</p>
<p>snap as he leaned forward to begin his cross-
</p>
<p>examination. "What relation was the mur-
</p>
<p>dered man to you?"
</p>
<p>"He he was my uncle."
</p>
<p>"Oh, he was, eh? H'm," he pondered to
</p>
<p>himself, "she doesn't seem to be cock-sure
</p>
<p>of it." Then aloud, as she began to shift
</p>
<p>uneasily under his steady gaze, he went on:
</p>
<p>"Well, what did you come to see me for?"
</p>
<p>He was tapping with the paper knife upon
</p>
<p>the table impatiently.
</p>
<p>"Because I think that you can help me,"
</p>
<p>said the woman.

<p>"Help you?" His long neck protruded
</p>
<p>A RELATIVE 257
</p>
<p>from his collar with a jerk. "Why should
</p>
<p>I help you?" he asked.
</p>
<p>"I have been reading your clever story of
</p>
<p>the Morton Mystery as it came out in the
</p>
<p>paper " the visitor went on.
</p>
<p>"Nothing strange about that!" its author
</p>
<p>interrupted. "Thousands are reading it.
</p>
<p>Those who are too stingy to buy a paper
</p>
<p>are stealing it over other peoples' shoulders."
</p>
<p>"But, Senor, you could not write this story
</p>
<p>so well unless you knew something "
</p>
<p>"Knew something!" he jerked out as if
</p>
<p>she had struck him. "Of course I know
</p>
<p>something. Don't I look intelligent? 5 '
</p>
<p>"But in your story you say so many things
</p>
<p>which are true," said Juanita Perez, with a
</p>
<p>little shiver.
</p>
<p>"True? Of course they are true." His
</p>
<p>head shot forward close to hers. "But how
</p>
<p>do you know that they are true?" he de-
</p>
<p>manded looking at her meaningly and in-
</p>
<p>tently.

</p>
<p>then, after looking towards the door, turned
</p>
<p>to him again and asked: "Are we quite
</p>
<p>alone, Senor?"
</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," he said impatiently. "Come
</p>
<p>to the point."
</p>
<p>"Well, I"
</p>
<p>Again his head shot forward as he inter-

<p>rupted her with: "Wait a minute though."
</p>
<p>His tone was now that of an inquisitor.
</p>
<p>"If you are Morton's relative, why haven't
</p>
<p>you come forward to claim his effects, eh?"
</p>
<p>The woman hesitated a moment and then

<p>said slowly: "Because I was arrested for

<p>get away from him? Why did he let you

</p>
<p>go?" he continued in his cross-examina-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>"Because two cab drivers saw me leave
</p>
<p>the hotel twenty minutes before the murder."
</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha!" he gloated. "So they found
</p>
<p>those cabbies at last, did they? I found
</p>
<p>them that very afternoon." He paused a
</p>
<p>moment as if in self -admiration, then went
</p>
<p>on : "At about what time did you call upon
</p>
<p>Morton?"
</p>
<p>Juanita calculated a moment : "At about
</p>
<p>four o'clock."
</p>
<p>"And you left at twenty minutes to five?"
</p>
<p>"Si, Senor."
</p>
<p>"While you were there did you see this

<p>woman, this Mary Hadfield, the stenogra-

</p>
<p>"No : Mr. Morton had told her not to come

<p>that day. So I didn't see her then."
</p>
<p>"Then." Clavering caught the emphasis

<p>she put on the word. "You haven't seen

<p>eagerly. "No one saw her leave the hotel."

<p>of his chair. "By George, we are getting at

<p>the missing link in this thing." He rubbed
</p>
<p>his hands together excitedly. "You say you
</p>
<p>saw her leave the hotel? How?"
</p>
<p>"By the fire-escape, from Mr. Morton's
</p>
<p>room."
</p>
<p>"The fire-escape!" The World's Great-

<p>est Authority on Crime was pacing the floor
</p>
<p>enthusiastically. "By the fire-escape! That
</p>
<p>was it, eh? That was how I had it worked

<p>out in my walk, and then things drove it out

<p>tirely unconscious for the moment of his

<p>sanity. "What then? Where were you?"
</p>
<p>"In a doorway across the street, waiting
</p>
<p>for Mr. Morton to come out," said Juanita.
</p>
<p>Clavering drew a chair close beside her.
</p>
<p>"Yes? What then? What happened?"
</p>
<p>"I had been waiting about fifteen minutes,
</p>
<p>when I saw a window in Morton's apartment

<p>open and a woman come out and go down

<p>the fire-escape to the street."
</p>
<p>"Could you see her face?"
</p>
<p>"Yes, when she came under the light."
</p>
<p>"Dark hair? Grey eyes? About so

<p>tall?" Clavering indicated by a gesture.
</p>
<p>Surprised at the accuracy of the descrip-

<p>Clavering clapped his hands. "That's

<p>behind her, expecting actually to see some

</p>
<p>"How was she dressed?" demanded Clav-

<p>compass that millinery detail.

<p>"A dark blue skirt and coat; with a white

<p>"Uh-huh!" went Clavering, making a

<p>mental note of the description. "Well, then,

</p>
<p>"Cafe Rossamano!" Clavering exclaimed.

<p>"The Cafe that Morton was calling up when

<p>he was stabbed!" His head was now

<p>stretched forward like a hound's that sniffs a

<p>"Yes, in another cab. When she reached

</p>
<p>"Where did she go then?"
</p>
<p>"She did not seem to know where to go.
</p>
<p>She walked and walked. She would stop
</p>
<p>always before a hotel as if to go in and then
</p>
<p>turn away. I followed her to Forty-second
</p>
<p>Street and Broadway. Then I think that

<p>she saw me and knew I was following her,

<p>for she ran quickly into a subway station
</p>
<p>and jumped on a train that was just starting.
</p>
<p>I missed the train, and could see her looking

</p>
<p>emotion and pressed her black-bordered
</p>
<p>handkerchief to her eyes, ''and then I learned
</p>
<p>of Mr. Morton's death."
</p>
<p>"Did you think then that the stenographer
</p>
<p>had killed him?" queried Clavering, heart-
</p>
<p>lessly breaking in upon this grief.
</p>
<p>"Si, Senor," the lady answered with a
</p>
<p>sob; "I felt sure of it."
</p>
<p>"Did you tell the police about her?"
</p>
<p>Here the relative of the late James Mor-
</p>
<p>ton forgot her sorrow for a moment, and with
</p>
<p>flashing eyes answered excitedly: "No! I
</p>
<p>would tell the police nothing."
</p>
<p>"Why not?" Clavering demanded sharply,
</p>
<p>for the first time betraying some suspicion
</p>
<p>of the woman's cleverly acted role.
</p>
<p>"We did not want them to know anything
</p>
<p>about this case."
</p>
<p>"We? Who are 'We'?"
</p>
<p>Something in the novelist's continued
</p>

<p>"We? Why, the relatives of Mr. Morton."

<p>itor. She was clever, and she thought she
</p>
<p>was fooling him, did she! But it was his
</p>
<p>move in the game next and he went on:
</p>
<p>"Why didn't you want the police to know?
</p>
<p>What had Morton been doing?"
</p>
<p>The woman leaned toward him in a con-
</p>
<p>fiding way, and lowering her voice said
</p>
<p>softly, and with a suggestion of embarrass-
</p>
<p>ment: "Well, you see, Mr. Morton was a
</p>
<p>married man, and this girl "
</p>
<p>"The stenographer, you mean?"
</p>
<p>"Yes. She was his his What you
</p>
<p>call it?" She paused as if uncertain of the
</p>
<p>word. "Ah, yes, his mistress. You see she
</p>
<p>killed him through jealousy. His wife, she
</p>
<p>knew nothing about her, and we are anxious
</p>
<p>she should not know. It would kill her, for
</p>
<p>she loved her husband very dearly."
</p>
<p>She drew a long, sobbing breath and again
</p>
<p>had recourse to the handkerchief. The
</p>
<p>black symbol of woe was flourished consider-
</p>
<p>ably as she finished her recital of the scandal
</p>
<p>overshadowing the house of Morton.

</p>
<p>about this girl, eh?" said Clavering, with an
</p>
<p>apparent sympathetic understanding of the
</p>
<p>situation, though at the same time an in-
</p>
<p>credulous smile twitched the corners of his
</p>
<p>mouth. "You're sure that's the right story,
</p>
<p>are you?" he asked. His tone implied that
</p>
<p>it was a good story but had failed to register.
</p>
<p>"Oh, yes! I'm sure," the woman eagerly
</p>
<p>answered.
</p>
<p>"Well," said Clavering, rising and walk-
</p>
<p>ing leisurely across the room, "that wasn't
</p>
<p>the way I had worked it out."
</p>
<p>"And how had you worked it out, Senor?"
</p>
<p>the woman asked.
</p>
<p>The crafty old man took a position where
</p>
<p>he could watch his visitor's face success-
</p>
<p>fully, and said musingly: "Well, you see,
</p>
<p>I was going to have Morton a member of
</p>
<p>the Scarlet Band"
</p>
<p>The almost imperceptible start she gave
</p>
<p>did not escape his keen eyes.
</p>
<p>"The Scarlet Band?" she stammered.

<p>he had not expected his first shot to take such

</p>
<p>good effect. "What is the Scarlet Band?"
</p>
<p>she hastened to inquire.
</p>
<p>Clavering looked surprised. "Never
</p>
<p>heard of the Scarlet Band?" he asked.
</p>
<p>She shook her head, then repeated naively
</p>
<p>her inquiry, "What is it?"
</p>
<p>"Xever heard of the Scarlet Band?" re-
</p>
<p>peated Clavering in a tone of shocked dis-
</p>
<p>appointment. "Well, I am surprised! I
</p>
<p>thought everybody knew about that. That's
</p>
<p>why I have written my story about it."
</p>
<p>"But what is it?" she persisted.
</p>
<p>"You said you were reading my story,
</p>
<p>didn't you?"
</p>
<p>He walked slowly towards her, gesticulat-
</p>
<p>ing with his long, bony fingers. She shifted
</p>
<p>uneasily under his steady gaze, and com-
</p>
<p>menced a nervous drumming upon the table,
</p>
<p>as he said ponderously, "It's a notorious band
</p>
<p>of cunning, conspiring criminals "
</p>
<p>The woman interrupted him, springing to
</p>
<p>her feet in an outburst of well-feigned indig-
</p>
<p>nation, exclaiming, "Mr. Morton could have

</p>
<p>"Of course he couldn't," said Clavering,
</p>
<p>with an appeasing pat on her shoulder, "but
</p>
<p>he's going to have in my story." Then
</p>
<p>changing abruptly to an uninterested man-
</p>
<p>ner, he announced curtly: "Have to ask
</p>
<p>you to go now. Haven't done any work to-
</p>
<p>day. Good-bye."
</p>
<p>He seated himself at his desk with an air
</p>
<p>of finality, and began scanning the pages of
</p>
<p>the manuscript before him.
</p>
<p>The woman protested. "But Mr. Clav-
</p>
<p>ering, I have not yet told you why I called."
</p>
<p>"Well, why did you call?" he snapped out.
</p>
<p>"To tell you that if you find the stenog-
</p>
<p>rapher, we the relatives will pay you
</p>
<p>well."
</p>
<p>"What makes you think I can find her?"
</p>
<p>he asked indifferently. He was very busy
</p>
<p>as he transferred the mental notes he had
</p>
<p>made during the interview to the paper be-
</p>
<p>fore him.
</p>
<p>"Because you have hit upon so many

</p>
<p>Clavering looked up with an air of grati-
</p>
<p>fication. "So you've heard that, have you?
</p>
<p>Well, it's true, and they call me 'Old Grape
</p>
<p>Nuts.' Well, perhaps Old Grape Nuts will
</p>
<p>show them a thing or two about this case
</p>
<p>yet." he chuckled, as he underlined the notes
</p>
<p>before him.
</p>
<p>The woman leaned across the table and
</p>
<p>smiled persuasively. "You are so clever.
</p>
<p>Won't you help us find this Mary Hadfield?
</p>
<p>We will pay you five hundred dollars if you

<p>will."

</p>
<p>"But there need be no risk," urged the
</p>
<p>woman, fearful lest Clavering decline to help
</p>
<p>her after all. "You can depend upon our
</p>
<p>silence."
</p>
<p>Clavering twirled his pencil in his hand as
</p>
<p>if undecided. "Well " he began.
</p>
<p>"Yes?" she encouraged hopefully.
</p>
<p>"If I should get any information, where
</p>
<p>could I reach you?"
</p>
<p>She scribbled rapidly on a piece of paper
</p>
<p>and handed it to him. "You may call that
</p>
<p>telephone number."
</p>
<p>"968 Gramercy," he read. "With whom
</p>
<p>am I to talk?"
</p>
<p>The woman deliberated a moment. "Ask
</p>
<p>for Enrico Savelli," she said.
</p>
<p>"Enrico Savelli," repeated Clavering,
</p>
<p>writing the name on the same slip as the tele-
</p>
<p>phone number. "Is he one of the mourn-
</p>
<p>ers?" She did not see the look of grim
</p>
<p>humour twitching at the corners of his
</p>
<p>mouth.

<p>"All right. I'll do the best I can. Good-

<p>Juanita smiled radiantly at him as she
</p>
<p>rose to leave the room. "I am very glad to
</p>
<p>have met so wonderful a man as you, Mr.
</p>
<p>Clavering," she said. "And you will try to
</p>
<p>find the girl, won't you? Good-bye!" she
</p>
<p>smiled upon him sweetly as she closed the
</p>
<p>door behind her.
</p>
<p>Clavering sat listening intently till he
</p>
<p>heard the hall door close below. Then he
</p>
<p>snapped his fingers contemptuously. "Pah!

<p>Relatives of Morton nothing! Scarlet
</p>
<p>Banders! That's what they are!"
</p>
<p>He began a drumming on the table and

<p>his thoughts travelled back over the inter-
</p>
<p>view. What did they want with the girl?
</p>
<p>Had she been a traitor? He dismissed

<p>the scandal story at once; he knew the

<p>sin of James Morton! He smiled as he
</p>
<p>272 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>pictured the consternation among the crest-
</p>
<p>fallen blue-coats when he should appear and
</p>
<p>say: "Well, here's the woman! I told you
</p>
<p>that it was the stenographer!"
</p>
<p>From imaginary triumphs his mind came
</p>
<p>back to the notes before him. The Spanish
</p>
<p>woman had given a good description of the
</p>
<p>girl and her movements after she had left
</p>
<p>the Beaumont. He ought to find her now.
</p>
<p>With his customary method of working out
</p>
<p>situations he began to assemble his new
</p>
<p>material. "Let me see," he mused aloud;
</p>
<p>"Taxi to Cafe Rossamano! Forty-Second
</p>
<p>Street to Subway Station. Down town.
</p>
<p>Down town," he repeated. "Yes, she would
</p>
<p>have a better chance of eluding pursuit
</p>
<p>there." Again he read his notes. "Medium
</p>
<p>height, dark complexion, grey eyes, dark
</p>
<p>blue skirt and coat white shirt waist and a

<p>red hat. Red hat!" he repeated. Then
</p>
<p>something registered in his brain with a click.

</p>
<p>A RELATIVE 273
</p>
<p>in his preoccupied walks; why should a red
</p>
<p>hat be filling a pigeon hole in his memory
</p>
<p>now, he wondered.
</p>
<p>"Jupiter!"
</p>
<p>He sprang to his feet and began pacing
</p>
<p>the floor furiously. He saw the wearer of
</p>
<p>the red hat now ! 'Twas the girl he had en-
</p>
<p>gaged at The Refuge for a stenographer!
</p>
<p>The one who was working for him now!
</p>
<p>Yes, she had worn a dark blue skirt and coat
</p>
<p>and a white shirt waist. His gaze wandered
</p>
<p>to the table where she had been working,
</p>
<p>and narrowed till his eyes seemed to be only
</p>
<p>points of light. Why had she wanted to
</p>
<p>quit work so abruptly? Why had she
</p>
<p>nearly collapsed when he had asked her to
</p>
<p>enact the stabbing? He sank into his chair
</p>
<p>again and sat there rigidly.
</p>
<p>How she had tricked him! And he had
</p>
<p>thought it was his vivid writing that had
</p>
<p>moved her! "Am I an old fool?" he gasped,
</p>
<p>his anger at himself almost choking him.

</p>
<p>then hesitated. "I must make sure," he
</p>
<p>muttered.
</p>
<p>With feverish haste he searched in the tele-

<p>phone directory for a number.
</p>
<p>"6 4 2 Chambers," he commanded.
</p>
<p>"Hurry, you fool! Now don't give me

<p>any back talk. Hello? Is this The Ref-

<p>"What can you tell me about that ste-

<p>He hung up the receiver and brought his

<p>hand down on the desk with a blow. It was
</p>
<p>all clear now. A woman answering the

<p>Only two hours more and she would be out

<p>Clavering as he stood with arm outstretched
</p>
<p>ready to begin his dictation, and caught her

<p>breath sharply. Was it her imagination or

<p>was there a stealthy vigilance in the baleful

<p>gleam of the eyes he fixed on her? Who
</p>
<p>could his caller have been?

<p>"Now start a new page. Begin Chapter

<p>''Chapter nine? You haven't finished

<p>quick look at him, wondering what was caus-

<p>ing him to deviate from his usual order.

<p>"Er " a moment of deliberation "We'll

</p>
<p>"The Refuge?" she exclaimed startled.
</p>
<p>Why that place, she wondered. She tried to

<p>throw a tinge of amused criticism in her tone,
</p>
<p>as she repeated, "The Refuge."
</p>
<p>Her confusion had not escaped Clavering.
</p>
<p>"There's a lot of atmosphere in that," he

<p>grin: "And I'll manage to get a thrill in it

<p>"Yes."
</p>
<p>The answer was so faint as to be barely

<p>audible. The girl crouched over her work

<p>as if some enemy were to spring upon her

<p>at any moment.

<p>Without taking his eyes from her face,

</p>
<p>turned into a side street and suddenly, into

<p>her big grey eyes, came the light of hope.
</p>
<p>There across the street an electric sign
</p>
<p>flashed its welcome : "The Refuge." ' "

<p>Clavering crouched like an animal about
</p>
<p>to spring upon its prey as he saw the girl's
</p>
<p>head fall forward on the table. She was
</p>
<p>at his mercy now! With a brave effort she
</p>
<p>roused herself.
</p>
<p>"No, no, I can't go on," she cried, as she
</p>
<p>swept the papers before her to the floor.
</p>
<p>"Can't you see that I am tired and sick?
</p>
<p>This confinement is killing me. I can't go
</p>
<p>on!"
</p>
<p>She darted for the door, but Clavering,
</p>
<p>with the agility of a cat, intercepted her and
</p>
<p>turned the key quietly in the lock.
</p>
<p>"No you don't. You can't leave here
</p>
<p>now!"
</p>
<p>She stood motionless, her face very white.
</p>
<p>"Can't leave here? I am not your prisoner,

<p>"Yes, you are my prisoner," he said.

<p>280 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>Margaret recoiled and he slowly advanced
</p>
<p>towards her. "Jupiter, but you're clever!"
</p>
<p>he cried. "For two weeks you've fooled me,
</p>
<p>me, the world's greatest authority on crime,
</p>
<p>and all the time I thought it was my story
</p>
<p>that was moving you."
</p>
<p>"It was, it was. What else could it have
</p>
<p>been?" the challenging grey eyes answered
</p>
<p>back.
</p>
<p>. The long arm of the novelist darted to-
</p>
<p>wards her with its pointing finger: "It was
</p>
<p>the guilty conscience of an assassin that was
</p>
<p>moving you," he hissed.
</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" the girl demanded,
</p>
<p>making a last desperate stand at denial.
</p>
<p>Slowly, relentlessly, while he unctuously
</p>
<p>rubbed his hands, Clavering hurled his ac-
</p>
<p>cusation at her: "You are the woman who
</p>
<p>murdered James Morton, and I'm going to

</p>
<p>shall not!" The lines of her mouth tight-
</p>
<p>ened and a determined gleam came to her
</p>
<p>eyes. "No, you are not going to give me
</p>
<p>up!" she cried, and sprang to the table and
</p>
<p>placed her hand on the telephone.
</p>
<p>"Who will stop me?" he snarled.
</p>
<p>"I will!"
</p>
<p>"You! Ha! 3100 Spring!" He had
</p>
<p>found the number.
</p>
<p>"It is true I did it ! But," she added with
</p>
<p>subtle emphasis, "you are not going to give
</p>
<p>me up until you know why I did it. That's
</p>
<p>not in your story, you know."
</p>
<p>"You confess?"
</p>
<p>"Yes! I am going to tell you everything

<p>and you are going to listen!"
</p>
<p>He felt himself falling under the spell of

<p>her superb determination. With a snort he
</p>
<p>tried to shake it off and reached for the in-
</p>
<p>strument once more. "I tell you I'm going

<p>But Margaret snatched the thing out of

<p>him listen : "No you are not, I say!"
</p>
<p>282 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>He made a movement as if to spring upon
</p>
<p>her and wrest the telephone from her grasp ;
</p>
<p>but again he felt the magnetism of her defi-
</p>
<p>ance. This was no ordinary criminal, this
</p>
<p>slender girl who stood there with flashing
</p>
<p>eyes and white face. Why had she killed
</p>
<p>James Morton? What had been her mo-
</p>
<p>tive? Ah, that was where his story had
</p>
<p>been weak ! He had never been sure of the
</p>
<p>motive. He would get it from her, and
</p>
<p>then, with a murmur, of whose significance
</p>
<p>he did not guess, he nodded to her, "Sit
</p>
<p>down!"
</p>
<p>As if the tension that had buoyed her up
</p>
<p>had snapped at last, she sank weakly into a
</p>
<p>chair, and after one of those minutes of
</p>
<p>silence that seem eternities, Clavering drew
</p>
<p>his chair close to hers, peering into her eyes
</p>
<p>and saying sharply: "Now tell me the
</p>
<p>whole story."
</p>
<p>Again Margaret told through the events
</p>
<p>that led up to her employment by Morton.

<p>she might have been pouring her tale into

</p>
<p>the ear of a granite sphinx. But once he
</p>
<p>admonished her sharply, "Not so fast!"
</p>
<p>And when she came to her brother's abduc-
</p>
<p>tion at the Rossamano, and her fear of its
</p>
<p>consequences to him, the novelist rubbed his
</p>
<p>hands in satisfaction. "So they got your
</p>
<p>brother, did they?" he gloated. "He
</p>
<p>wouldn't take my advice."
</p>
<p>Margaret's heart sank. With a man's
</p>
<p>life at stake, would Clavering prove vin-
</p>
<p>dictive? And he, why should he not give
</p>
<p>up this girl, he thought. She had con-
</p>
<p>fessed that she had committed the murder.
</p>
<p>He had found out her motive ; that was what
</p>
<p>he needed for his story. Of course there
</p>
<p>were extenuating circumstances; still she
</p>
<p>had done it. If her brother had fallen
</p>
<p>into the hands of the Scarlet Band it was
</p>
<p>his own fault. He had been warned. If
</p>
<p>he knew so much more than anybody else,
</p>
<p>let him get himself out of their clutches.
</p>
<p>If he let the girl go, what then? She was
</p>
<p>bound to be caught sooner or later, and then

<p>isfaction of confronting Ryan with her.
</p>
<p>"You couldn't catch your own feet!" The
</p>
<p>captain's taunting words came back to him.
</p>
<p>Had he not boasted that he would walk
</p>
<p>into headquarters with that stenographer?
</p>
<p>"And by Jupiter I will!" he broke out.
</p>
<p>He crossed to the telephone. Margaret,
</p>
<p>alert for the reopening of hostilities, caught
</p>
<p>his arm. "What are you going to do?" she
</p>
<p>cried.
</p>
<p>"I've caught you and I'm going to give
</p>
<p>you up!"
</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Clavering, think, think!" She
</p>
<p>dropped on her knees beside his chair. "It
</p>
<p>is not for myself," she pleaded. "Think of
</p>
<p>my brother in the clutch of those men!
</p>
<p>You have in your hands the power to save
</p>
<p>him! Think of the good that he has done!
</p>
<p>Think of all that he and I can do in this life,
</p>
<p>if you spare us! His life means so much

<p>sobbed.

<p>treaty. "No," he snarled, "I'm going to
</p>
<p>give Ryan the laugh."
</p>
<p>He reached for the telephone and she
</p>
<p>raised her head. In a flash she saw the
</p>
<p>name Savelli on the paper on his desk.
</p>
<p>"Savelli! Good God!"

</p>
<p>Frantically she placed her hand over the

<p>transmitter "Mr. Clavering, listen! What

<p>good is it going to do you to give me up?
</p>
<p>Why not capture all those terrible men?
</p>
<p>You know where they are, you have the tele-
</p>
<p>phone number of their leader, Enrico Sav-

<p>elli, before you now!" Craftily she pic-
</p>
<p>tured the enterprise. "Why not capture
</p>
<p>them all? Think what a marvellous thing
</p>
<p>it would be? How it would enhance your
</p>
<p>reputation as a writer! What a wonderful
</p>
<p>climax it would make to your story, to save
</p>
<p>the Assistant District Attorney and capture
</p>
<p>the entire Scarlet Band!" She incited him,
</p>
<p>flattered him, with all the skill a terrified,
</p>
<p>desperate woman could command.

<p>His face grew rigid, his lips parted as if

</p>
<p>he gasped for breath. Then she saw his
</p>
<p>eyes begin to snap again and his head pro-
</p>
<p>trude. Had she touched the magic key that
</p>
<p>should loose the genii of his imagination?
</p>
<p>Had she?
</p>
<p>He drew a long breath. "You're right!"
</p>
<p>he muttered. "If I rescue your brother I
</p>
<p>may catch the whole gang!"
</p>
<p>"Don't say 'may,' say will! Of course
</p>
<p>you will," she urged.
</p>
<p>"What would Ryan say then, eh?" he
</p>
<p>gloated. "Why, the entire police force
</p>
<p>would die of apoplexy!"
</p>
<p>"Yes, or of chagrin!" she agreed.
</p>
<p>"And as you say, what a finish for my
</p>
<p>story!" he ejaculated, throwing up his arms.
</p>
<p>"The description of the rescue would make
</p>
<p>a great chapter, wouldn't it?" There was
</p>
<p>something almost pathetic in the way the
</p>
<p>lonely old genius began to turn to the girl
</p>
<p>beside him for sympathy. She felt a hypo-
</p>
<p>crite, but she must go on.

<p>"But," he shook his head, "there's a chap-

<p>ter before that. When I had you on the

<p>rack ! Ha ! ha ! I did have you on the rack,
</p>
<p>didn't I? That's a good heading: 'The

<p>memorandum: "Chapter ten The Rack.

</p>
<p>"Mr. Clavering, you will save my brother,
</p>
<p>won't you?" pleaded Margaret.
</p>
<p>"We'll see, we'll see," he cried.
</p>
<p>He came to a sudden halt again at the
</p>
<p>sound of the doorbell. "Now who's that?"
</p>
<p>he asked petulantly.
</p>
<p>"Oh, perhaps it's Jack! I mean Mr.

<p>genuine.

</p>
<p>he said, adding, as he looked over his spec-

</p>
<p>"Huh !" grumbled Clavering. "He called

<p>me Old Grape Nuts."
</p>
<p>"Oh, do you suppose he can possibly have

<p>some word from Victor?" she interrupted
</p>
<p>anxiously.

<p>There came a sound of hurrying steps on

<p>the stairs and Howell burst into the room.

<p>"Margaret, Margaret," he called in a hoarse

<p>whisper that yet was almost as penetrating
</p>
<p>as a shout: "I've got it!"
</p>
<p>In the excitement of his entrance he had

<p>not seen Clavering, but as he caught a
</p>
<p>glimpse of his scowling face and feared lest
</p>
<p>he had betrayed her secret, the change in his

<p>own was ludicrous.

<p>to the rescue. "You may go on, Jack.

<p>THE TRAP 289
</p>
<p>"I haven't said that I would," growled
</p>
<p>the unfeeling novelist.
</p>
<p>"Help us!" Howell was puzzled. How
</p>
<p>could the old sleuth who had sworn to arrest
</p>
<p>the murderer of James Morton help them,
</p>
<p>he wondered.
</p>
<p>"Yes," Margaret continued, as though
</p>
<p>the author had not spoken. "Mr. Claver-
</p>
<p>ing and I have talked it all over. He sees
</p>
<p>a way to rescue Victor and capture that

</p>
<p>Jack one long, expressive look. "He is
</p>
<p>going to have all that material for his story ;
</p>
<p>don't you see what a wonderful opportunity
</p>
<p>it is for him?"
</p>
<p>Thoroughly awakened to the situation
</p>
<p>now, Howell proceeded to co-operate too and
</p>
<p>do his share. "Why, Mr. Clavering," he
</p>
<p>exclaimed, "if you can save Victor Holt and

<p>paper man was in his element. "SCAR-

</p>
<p>Clavering's narrow chest began to expand
</p>
<p>as Howell dipped his blarney brush into
</p>
<p>colours more and more dazzling. "WIN-

</p>
<p>Why, they can't be printed fast enough."
</p>
<p>For a moment Clavering had the vision of

<p>out?"
</p>
<p>"I went to the house on Fourth Street,

<p>the cord Holt was to lower from the window.
</p>
<p>I knew that I was taking big chances, but I

<p>went right after it."
</p>
<p>"It was there?" asked Margaret, quivering
</p>
<p>with excitement.
</p>
<p>"I kept in close to the house, till something
</p>
<p>caught on the rim of my hat. I put my hand

<p>up and felt a piece of tape. To make sure
</p>
<p>I gave it a yank. In a second I felt it

<p>tighten in my hand, and I knew that I had
</p>
<p>hold of a live wire. Then I fastened our

<p>message to it and gave another jerk and up

<p>"And he knows now that we are trying to

<p>rescue him!" exclaimed the girl in a perfect
</p>
<p>transport of joy and relief at last.
</p>
<p>"Huh! Huh!" said Clavering. "What
</p>
<p>did you do then?"
</p>
<p>"Well, I knew it wouldn't do to stick
</p>
<p>around that house too long," continued Jack,
</p>
<p>"so I hustled to Mr. Wilson's, that's her
</p>
<p>Uncle Mark, you know, to his room across
</p>
<p>the street and watched for the signal we had
</p>
<p>agreed upon together. I had not waited
</p>
<p>long before I saw the flicker of a lighted
</p>
<p>match. I tell you I almost jumped from
</p>
<p>the window in my rush to get to that cord."
</p>
<p>"He got an answer to you, did he?" broke
</p>
<p>in Clavering, now following the game with
</p>
<p>the keenest concentration.
</p>
<p>"Yes," said Howell, and produced a slip
</p>
<p>of paper from his hat lining. It read : "Am
</p>
<p>guarded by four people. Enrico Savelli "
</p>
<p>Clavering reached for the address his late
</p>
<p>visitor had given him. "Huh! Good! Go

</p>
<p>away, I can manage the fourth and escape."
</p>
<p>"He says that, does he?" said Clavering.
</p>
<p>Then, after a moment's pause, he asked,
</p>
<p>"Who is the woman? This Juanita?"
</p>
<p>"Juanita Perez? I know her. She's one
</p>
<p>of the gang," said Margaret.
</p>
<p>"That must be the woman who followed
</p>
<p>you from the Beaumont, the Spanish woman
</p>
<p>who called here to-night," said Clavering.
</p>
<p>He favoured the girl with a look of grim
</p>
<p>humour. "Hence some of my marvellous de-
</p>
<p>ductions," he added. Then he sought his
</p>
<p>path on the red carpet again, his treadmill
</p>
<p>of inspiration, and paced back and forth, his
</p>
<p>head bent forward.
</p>
<p>Margaret, with a gesture, warned Howell
</p>
<p>not to disturb his meditations. She knew
</p>
<p>they would lead him to some vital point.
</p>
<p>"If we could get three of them away he
</p>
<p>might have a chance," the novelist muttered.
</p>
<p>"That ought to be easy! That ought to be
</p>
<p>easy!" He stopped abruptly, and Mar-

<p>294 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>"Do you know any of the detectives who
</p>
<p>have been working for Holt?" he demanded
</p>
<p>with a suddenness that made Howell jump.
</p>
<p>"Sure. I know Billy Flynn, Holt's most
</p>
<p>trusted assistant," said Jack.
</p>
<p>"How well do you know him?" asked
</p>
<p>Clavering.
</p>
<p>"I lunch with him about once a week,"
</p>
<p>replied the reporter, wondering what was
</p>
<p>coming.
</p>
<p>"Know his telephone number?"
</p>
<p>"Sure I do!" said Jack.
</p>
<p>"Well, sit down there," Clavering com-
</p>
<p>manded. "How far from here is the house
</p>
<p>where they've got Holt?"
</p>
<p>"Five minutes at the outside," was How-
</p>
<p>ell's calculation.
</p>
<p>"All right! All right, then. Call up
</p>
<p>Flynn."
</p>
<p>"What's the idea?" demanded Jack.
</p>
<p>"Put me on."
</p>
<p>"Don't ask questions! Call him up, will
</p>
<p>you?" persisted the criminologist.

</p>
<p>"Can't say anything till you do get him,

</p>
<p>"Hello! Three - five - five - five Spring?

</p>
<p>"Is he there?" asked Margaret eagerly.
</p>
<p>"Yes, they've just gone to get him."
</p>
<p>"Good!" said Clavering. "Now ask him
</p>
<p>how soon he can get four of his best men up

</p>
<p>Howell nodded his understanding.

<p>"He says he can get them here in fifteen

</p>
<p>"He can, eh?" reflected Clavering for a

<p>moment. "That's too soon. Tell him

</p>
<p>"All right," said the author, and snapped

<p>any blunders. Good-bye!" Then turning
</p>
<p>to Howell he directed, "You go to the house
</p>
<p>where they've got Holt."
</p>
<p>"Surely," Jack acquiesced. Old Claver-
</p>
<p>ing's daring plan was beginning to unfold
</p>
<p>itself to him reassuringly.
</p>
<p>"You watch that house. If you see two
</p>
<p>men and a woman come out of it, you get

</p>
<p>"I'm on the job!" said Howell. He
</p>
<p>dashed off eagerly to execute his part in the

<p>game. Again Clavering consulted his

<p>watch and moved to the telephone.
</p>
<p>"Oh," broke in Margaret, "how can I ever

<p>thank"
</p>
<p>"Sh! Keep quiet!" the old man com-
</p>
<p>manded. "968 Gramercy!" he called into

<p>the receiver. Margaret held her breath.
</p>
<p>"Hello! 968 Gramercy? This is Win-

</p>
<p>Oh, you are the young woman who came to

<p>he snapped; "I want to talk with Savelli,

</p>
<p>and hurry up." He looked at his watch
</p>
<p>carefully. "Hello? Is this Savelli? This

</p>
<p>listen to me. If you can get here to my

<p>house in ten minutes I'll hand that stenogra-

</p>
<p>The girl drew a gasping breath but the
</p>
<p>pressure of Clavering's hand on her own re-
</p>
<p>assured her.
</p>
<p>"What? How could I hand her over to

<p>you if I hadn't found her? Here, and bring

<p>that young woman who called on me this

</p>
<p>I don't want any noise about it. She's a

<p>very dangerous woman." He shot a comi-
</p>
<p>cal glance at the slender girl across the table.
</p>
<p>"What! You haven't got another man
</p>
<p>there? Oh, I'm sorry! I shall have to turn

</p>
<p>All right. Good-bye!"
</p>
<p>"They are coming here?" cried Margaret,
</p>
<p>terrified; but Clavering did not stop to

<p>answer her. He went to the hall door in-

</p>
<p>"No, I won't fergit, Honey, don't yo's

<p>be pretty bad if they got here too soon

<p>"Oh, you can depend upon Mr. Flynn,"

<p>"Well, I hope so!" he growled; then ex-

<p>desperate were the men he was luring to the

<p>house.
</p>
<p>He patted her hand gently. "I'll take

</p>
<p>we'll start right in and finish that story, eh?"
</p>
<p>He began to pace the floor. In his hand

<p>he held his watch, and in his eyes was the in-
</p>
<p>tent, feverish look of the gambler who
</p>
<p>watches for a card to fall upon the table.

<p>THE PLOT

<p>"Two gentlemen and a lady to see you, sah!"
</p>
<p>announced Martha, just ten minutes after
</p>
<p>Clavering's telephone message to Enrico
</p>
<p>Savelli.
</p>
<p>"Gosh!" he ejaculated. How did they

<p>get here so soon ? He wondered if he should

<p>be able to delay the proceedings until the
</p>
<p>detectives were safely arrived? In some
</p>
<p>way, somehow, he mu^t, or his plan would
</p>
<p>end in miserable failure. "Well, show them
</p>
<p>up here," he said presently.
</p>
<p>"Yes, sah," answered Martha.
</p>
<p>As the old negress shuffled out Clavering
</p>
<p>pushed up the window and looked anxiously
</p>
<p>up and down the street. There was no sign
</p>
<p>of any one outside.
</p>
<p>"That's right," he muttered. "I told
</p>
<p>them not to come for twenty-five minutes."

<p>THE PLOT 303
</p>
<p>Then he closed the window suddenly as he
</p>
<p>heard Martha returning in the hall, accom-
</p>
<p>panied by other footsteps and a silken rustle
</p>
<p>that he connected with the draperies of the
</p>
<p>relative of the late James Morton. He
</p>
<p>climbed the rickety ladder to his book-
</p>
<p>shelves, and he made a show of hunting for
</p>
<p>some volume there.
</p>
<p>"Right this way, please," said Martha,
</p>
<p>opening the door of the study.
</p>
<p>Enrico Savelli, Juanita Perez and a
</p>
<p>fidgety little man with a huge nose whom
</p>
<p>there was no difficulty in identifying as
</p>
<p>Weinberg, entered the room quietly.
</p>
<p>Juanita had on the same elaborate mourning
</p>
<p>that she had worn upon her earlier visit.
</p>
<p>Savelli also was dressed in quiet colors, but
</p>
<p>betrayed the carefully anointed hair and
</p>
<p>twisted moustaches of a barber.
</p>
<p>The novelist peered down upon the group
</p>
<p>from the top round of his ladder a moment.
</p>
<p>"Oh, yes ; the relatives of the late Mr. Mor-
</p>
<p>ton," he exclaimed. "Sit down. I'll be

<p>with you in a minute." He proceeded in a
</p>
<p>304 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>very leisurely way to take a book from the
</p>
<p>shelf and began to dust it, muttering a while,
</p>
<p>but making no further move.
</p>
<p>Weinberg began to snap his fingers im-
</p>
<p>patiently, while Savelli scowled up at the
</p>
<p>unperturbed figure on the ladder; neither
</p>
<p>enjoyed the humour of the situation that
</p>
<p>was clear.
</p>
<p>"Just looking for a book," explained Clav-
</p>
<p>ering, replacing the one he held and reach-
</p>
<p>ing for another. "Ah! here it is!" He
</p>
<p>opened it, looked it through from cover to
</p>
<p>cover, and then descended.
</p>
<p>"Johnson's Anatomy. That's it! Have
</p>
<p>to know everything nowadays to be an au-
</p>
<p>thor," he explained. "Must understand
</p>
<p>what you are writing about. If one of your
</p>
<p>characters has liver complaint, you've got to
</p>
<p>know where the liver is ; the colour of it and
</p>
<p>its size, you see."
</p>
<p>A grunt of impatience escaped from Sa-
</p>
<p>velli. Weinberg got up and sat down
</p>
<p>again.

<p>"Excuse me, Mr. Clavering," interposed
</p>
<p>THE PLOT 805
</p>
<p>Juanita Perez at last, as she saw that Clav-
</p>
<p>ering was about to deliver an exhaustless
</p>
<p>lecture on his favourite theme. "We have
</p>
<p>only a little time, you know. This is Mr.
</p>
<p>Savelli, Mr. Clavering."
</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Snivelli?" Clavering looked over
</p>
<p>his spectacles at the oily Italian, who ac-
</p>
<p>knowledged the introduction and resented
</p>
<p>the wrong cognomen with a curt bow. "And
</p>
<p>who is the other gentleman?"
</p>
<p>Juanita next introduced the nervous little
</p>
<p>man with the large nose and the snapping
</p>
<p>fingers.
</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Weinberg? Very glad to meet
</p>
<p>you, Mr. Weinberg." Producing the bag
</p>
<p>of sweets from which he occasionally re-
</p>
<p>galed himself, he offered it to the exas-
</p>
<p>perated Jew, and added: "Have a pepper-
</p>
<p>mint?"
</p>
<p>"No I No !" barked Weinberg.
</p>
<p>"You?" Clavering graciously offered it to
</p>
<p>Savelli.
</p>
<p>"No!" said Savelli, with a disgusted growl.

<p>306 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>quite unabashed, turning to Juanita ; but she
</p>
<p>too was not to be placated in that way.
</p>
<p>To consume more time, the crafty sleuth
</p>
<p>searched in the bag to find a peppermint
</p>
<p>for himself and thrust it in his mouth. The
</p>
<p>effect of the apparently innocent lozenge
</p>
<p>was extraordinary.
</p>
<p>"Ugh !" he sputtered, "moth balls ! Darn
</p>
<p>this old coat ! Plague take that old Martha.
</p>
<p>Moth balls, ugh!"
</p>
<p>But sympathy for this contretemps did
</p>
<p>not efface the very obvious appearance of
</p>
<p>impatience at the delay in the countenances
</p>
<p>of his three callers. He turned about upon
</p>
<p>another tack.
</p>
<p>"Weinberg," he said, reflectively. "Had
</p>
<p>a character in one of my books once called
</p>
<p>Weinberg. Good Italian name, that."
</p>
<p>The irony of this remark appeared alto-
</p>
<p>gether to escape his impatient visitors.

</p>
<p>Mr. Savelli and Mr. Weinberg left im-
</p>
<p>portant business to come here." The
</p>
<p>Italian confirmed this with a nod and Wein-
</p>
<p>berg's nails commenced their nervous snap-
</p>
<p>ping again.
</p>
<p>"Oh, they did, eh?" commented Clavering.
</p>
<p>"Well " he apologised for his deliberation,
</p>
<p>"then we must hurry."
</p>
<p>Savelli rose from his chair. "Yes, yes,
</p>
<p>where is she?" he demanded fiercely.
</p>
<p>"She? Who?" Clavering asked blankly.
</p>
<p>"The woman! The stenographer," said
</p>
<p>Savelli.
</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, yes," said Clavering, as if at last
</p>
<p>he realised the object of their visit. "Oh,
</p>
<p>I've got her right where I can put my hand
</p>
<p>on her. Don't you forget that."
</p>
<p>There was a simultaneous expression of
</p>
<p>surprise from each of the members of the
</p>
<p>Scarlet Band. Savelli was the first to speak :
</p>
<p>"She is not here?"

<p>The novelist returned the Italian's glare
</p>
<p>808 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>with a look of tolerant surprise. "Why of
</p>
<p>course not," he said. "What made you
</p>
<p>think that she was here?"
</p>
<p>"I thought from what you said over the
</p>
<p>telephone " A thunderous scowl began to
</p>
<p>make the evil face of Savelli look more dan-
</p>
<p>gerous than ever.
</p>
<p>"I told you that I had found the woman,
</p>
<p>but you don't think that I'd keep her here, do
</p>
<p>you?" demanded Clavering. "I told you
</p>
<p>that she was a dangerous character," he
</p>
<p>added with an aggrieved look, as if the idea
</p>
<p>of using his study as a place of detention for
</p>
<p>dangerous females was preposterous on its
</p>
<p>face.
</p>
<p>There was another hurried exchange of
</p>
<p>uneasy glances between Savelli and the
</p>
<p>woman, while Clavering strained his ears to
</p>
<p>catch some sound from the street.
</p>
<p>"Then you must take us to her at once,"
</p>
<p>asseverated the Italian, and Weinberg, re-
</p>
<p>newing his Jack-in-the-box antics from his

</p>
<p>hear?"
</p>
<p>THE PLOT 309
</p>
<p>"Just a minute, in a minute," promised
</p>
<p>the novelist in pacifying tones. "Why,
</p>
<p>what's the matter, Mr. Weinberg? You act
</p>
<p>as if you had St. Vitus's dance. Did you
</p>
<p>ever read my story about the burglar
</p>
<p>who had St. Vitus's dance? It finally be-
</p>
<p>trayed him. Where is that story?" He be-
</p>
<p>gan searching among a pile of books on the
</p>
<p>mantel, surreptitiously looking out of the
</p>
<p>window all the time.
</p>
<p>The exasperated trio held a mumbled con-
</p>
<p>versation together.
</p>
<p>"He is an old fool," Weinberg was saying,
</p>
<p>and looked ready to cry from vexation.
</p>
<p>"Sh!" protested Juanita, trying to quiet
</p>
<p>her impatient companions. "Let me try him
</p>
<p>again." Then, addressing Clavering in her
</p>
<p>sweetest tones, though he seemed unmindful
</p>
<p>of her presence, she pleaded: "Come; take us
</p>
<p>to the woman, this stenographer, at once if
</p>
<p>she is not here."
</p>
<p>"Eh?" He turned from his search among
</p>
<p>the books. "Of course," he added in a tone

</p>
<p>ested in my stories that I forget everything
</p>
<p>else. Of course. We will go now to the
</p>
<p>woman."
</p>
<p>With sighs of relief the gangsters rose and
</p>
<p>prepared to follow Clavering. "Oh, do I
</p>
<p>need an overcoat?" he stopped and asked
</p>
<p>abruptly. "Is it cold out of doors?" He
</p>
<p>went to the window again, peered at the ther-
</p>
<p>mometer, then dropped his glance quickly to
</p>
<p>the street.
</p>
<p>"No, no," assured Juanita. "It is not
</p>
<p>cold. Come!"
</p>
<p>"All right ! Fifty-five, the glass says," he
</p>
<p>demurred. "I don't want to get a cold.
</p>
<p>Colds are very bad for mental workers.
</p>
<p>They clog up the cells of the brain." He
</p>
<p>went to one of his shelves and took down a
</p>
<p>jar to show them. "Did you ever see a hu-
</p>
<p>man brain? It's a most interesting study."
</p>
<p>He struck a professional pose, and with a
</p>
<p>wave of his long arm began: "This is the
</p>
<p>brain of a criminal. You notice the forma-
</p>
<p>tion of the left lobe . . ."

</p>
<p>"Ah! Bah!" broke in Savelli impatiently,
</p>
<p>THE PLOT 311
</p>
<p>looking ready to strangle the criminologist
</p>
<p>then and there, and Juanita implored : "Mr.
</p>
<p>Clavering, Mr. Clavering, if you do not take
</p>
<p>us to the woman now we shall not be able to
</p>
<p>wait."
</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," meekly replied the

<p>enthusiast on brains, taking time nevertheless
</p>
<p>to replace the specimen carefully on the
</p>
<p>shelf. "There, that's right. Now we'll
</p>
<p>go."
</p>
<p>Again the trio started towards the door.
</p>
<p>"Here, hold on! Wait a minute!" called
</p>
<p>Clavering again.
</p>
<p>"What is it now?" growled Savelli sav-
</p>
<p>agely, while the Jew fairly danced around
</p>
<p>the room in convulsions of impatience.
</p>
<p>"Did you bring the money?"
</p>
<p>"Yes!" the Italian snarled. "We have it
</p>
<p>here."
</p>
<p>"Let's see it!" demanded Clavering,
</p>
<p>sitting at his table, and indicating plainly
</p>
<p>that proceedings were at a standstill until
</p>
<p>they could satisfy him on the point of their

<p>312 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>"You do not trust me!" glowered Savelli.
</p>
<p>"I don't trust anybody. Let me see the
</p>
<p>money," persisted the novelist-financier.
</p>
<p>Savelli glanced at Juanita, who nodded
</p>
<p>her head. "I will convince you," he said
</p>
<p>then, and drew from his pocket a large roll
</p>
<p>of bills and slapped them on the table before
</p>
<p>Clavering. "There are five hundred dol-
</p>
<p>lars," he added sarcastically. "Will you
</p>
<p>count them?"
</p>
<p>Clavering moistened his fingers and with
</p>
<p>maddening deliberation counted bill after
</p>
<p>bill. "Is it all good? No counterfeits?" he
</p>
<p>queried, taking up a huge magnifying glass
</p>
<p>from the table, and peering through to test
</p>
<p>the validity of the greenbacks, which were
</p>
<p>evil-smelling enough to have been long in
</p>
<p>circulation.
</p>
<p>"It is good money from the Banca Napoli
</p>
<p>e Sicilia," asserted the Italian.
</p>
<p>"Well, I'm not sure about that one," ob-
</p>
<p>jected the examiner, with a prolonged scru-
</p>
<p>tiny of one yellow-back beneath the glass.

<p>ished counting slowly. "Look here! This
</p>
<p>is only five hundred dollars."
</p>
<p>"That is what I said," protested Juanita.
</p>
<p>Clavering pushed the money towards Sa-
</p>
<p>velli scornfully. "No! I wouldn't waste
</p>
<p>my time for five hundred dollars."
</p>
<p>"But that was our agreement," persisted
</p>
<p>the woman.
</p>
<p>The novelist shook his head obdurately.
</p>
<p>"Why, I wouldn't get mixed up in this for
</p>
<p>less than a thousand dollars at least, my dear
</p>
<p>lady."
</p>
<p>"Oh, but we couldn't afford to pay that.
</p>
<p>We are poor," whined Weinberg.
</p>
<p>Clavering took up his manuscript as if
</p>
<p>he had no further interest in their project.
</p>
<p>"Be careful of the stairs when you go out.
</p>
<p>It's dark in the hall," he cautioned as if he
</p>
<p>had spoken the final word.
</p>
<p>With muttered imprecations the trio
</p>
<p>paused for consultation. Glavering listened
</p>
<p>intently. Were they really going? Had

<p>he played the game too far? He glanced

<p>at his watch. In three minutes Flynn ought
</p>
<p>314 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>to give his signal. The novelist held his
</p>
<p>breath in suspense; then as he saw the three
</p>
<p>turn back again, he bent more busily than
</p>
<p>ever over his manuscript. "Ah, ha!" he
</p>
<p>chuckled to himself. "The flies haven't
</p>
<p>wriggled out of the web yet."
</p>
<p>"We will give you six hundred dollars,"
</p>
<p>Juanita announced, as she came back to his
</p>
<p>desk. "That is all we can do; the relatives
</p>
<p>are poor."
</p>
<p>Only two minutes more, Clavering was
</p>
<p>calculating.
</p>
<p>"Well, when you get rich, come back and
</p>
<p>I'll talk with you," he replied, without rais-
</p>
<p>ing his eyes from the pages before him.
</p>
<p>Another mumbled conference followed;
</p>
<p>then Juanita threw another pile of bills on
</p>
<p>the table. "We will give you what you
</p>
<p>want, then," she said curtly.
</p>
<p>"So! Not so poor as you were a while
</p>
<p>ago," said Clavering, gathering up the
</p>
<p>money. He rose and glanced at the clock.

<p>THE PLOT 315
</p>
<p>change my coat." He moved off and had
</p>
<p>almost reached his bedroom door when
</p>
<p>"Snap, Snap," something rattled against
</p>
<p>the window pane. An exultant smile
</p>
<p>beamed upon his crafty face as he turned.
</p>
<p>"What's that?" cried Savelli, starting up.
</p>
<p>"It's those street ruffians blowing beans at
</p>
<p>my window. I'll get my cane and give them
</p>
<p>a good thrashing," Clavering raged.
</p>
<p>The Italian gripped his arm. "Why did
</p>
<p>you send for us to come here?" he demanded
</p>
<p>savagely.
</p>
<p>"Why, I thought you wanted to capture
</p>
<p>that stenographer," was the meek reply.
</p>
<p>A sharp cry of warning from Weinberg
</p>
<p>brought Savelli to the door.
</p>
<p>"Listen!" cried the terrified Jew.
</p>
<p>There was a sound of hurrying feet in the
</p>
<p>hall below. Juanita rushed to the door too,
</p>
<p>and bent her ear.
</p>
<p>"It's a trap!" she shrieked, rushing back
</p>
<p>to her companion. With an oath Savelli
</p>
<p>drew a knife and lunged at Clavering:

<p>ing rattle. The next moment they found
</p>
<p>themselves in utter darkness.
</p>
<p>The novelist had reached the electric light
</p>
<p>switch and turned off the light. There was
</p>
<p>a rush of feet on the stairs, the darting flash
</p>
<p>of a dark lantern. Curses and blows and
</p>
<p>cries sounded.
</p>
<p>"Here's one of them!"
</p>
<p>"I've got him!"
</p>
<p>"Drop that knife ! Drop it !"
</p>
<p>A scream, the snapping of handcuffs, then
</p>
<p>the voice of Flynn shouting to his men to put

<p>on the lights, followed.
</p>
<p>"The switch! Right hand, by the door!"
</p>
<p>yelled Clavering.
</p>
<p>Click! Flash! The lights were on.
</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha!" jeered Clavering. "A good

<p>joke, eh?"
</p>
<p>In the moment of darkness he had

<p>and now, in the blinding rekindling of the

<p>THE PLOT 317
</p>
<p>with almost boyish glee at his dramatic cap-

<p>ture.
</p>
<p>There came another sound of feet upon
</p>
<p>the stairs, whereupon Jack Howell and a
</p>
<p>good-looking young man whom there was no
</p>
<p>difficulty in identifying as Victor Holt burst
</p>
<p>in, dragging between them still another ter-
</p>
<p>rified captive.
</p>
<p>"Well, this is immense!" shouted the re-
</p>
<p>porter, as he looked about the room.
</p>
<p>"We've got all four of them! Here's the
</p>
<p>man who did the trick, Mr. Holt." He
</p>
<p>grasped the hand of the elated Clavering
</p>
<p>and presented the lawyer and the novelist to

<p>each other.
</p>
<p>But the latter had no time for congratu-

<p>waving his hands impatiently at the detect-

</p>
<p>his desk. The capture of four members of
</p>
<p>the Scarlet Band was lost as an everyday
</p>
<p>occurrence in the resurgence of his ruling
</p>
<p>passion.
</p>
<p>"But Margaret, my sister, where is she?"
</p>
<p>demanded Holt, laying his hand on the old
</p>
<p>man's shoulder.
</p>
<p>"Oh, that's so!" said Clavering, who had
</p>
<p>been oblivious of Margaret too in the flood
</p>
<p>of inspiration that swept over him. "I'll call
</p>
<p>her!"
</p>
<p>Margaret came quickly at his summons,
</p>
<p>and paused at the door a moment, then with
</p>
<p>a wild cry of joy rushed straight to her
</p>
<p>brother's arms.
</p>
<p>"Victor! Victor!" she sobbed as he
</p>
<p>clasped her close. "I have you back ! You
</p>
<p>are safe! Oh, my dear, is it true? Is it
</p>
<p>true?"
</p>
<p>For a moment Victor Holt could not
</p>
<p>speak. Then he bent his head close to the
</p>
<p>dark one of his sister lying on his breast.

<p>THE END OF THE STORY
</p>
<p>SPRING had come again, and the wooded
</p>
<p>hills about Chester, up in Maine, were green
</p>
<p>with vigorous, new foliage. The brook that
</p>
<p>wound down the hillside babbled its welcome
</p>
<p>to the vernal change, and leaped forward
</p>
<p>along its rocky bed in copious floods. Now
</p>
<p>stopping to take breath in some shady pool,
</p>
<p>pushing on again over mossy rocks, in whirl-
</p>
<p>ing, Dervish-like eddies, it joined with the
</p>
<p>birds to make Spring audible.
</p>
<p>Margaret Holt watched the sparkling

<p>water. It seemed to be singing to her, an-

<p>swering the troubled questions in her heart ;

<p>there are tranquil waters. Come! Come!"

<p>322 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>watch his sister. What a picture she made,
</p>
<p>he thought, as she sat there, leaning her chin
</p>
<p>upon her hand. Her grey eyes, black now
</p>
<p>with the intensity of her thought, gazed
</p>
<p>sweetly into space; the soft breeze blew
</p>
<p>gently on the tendrils of her lustrous hair;
</p>
<p>her cheeks were flushed with pink ; her whole
</p>
<p>figure glowed with spirit and perfect health.
</p>
<p>"What are you thinking of, Sis?" he
</p>
<p>asked, as he dropped to the ground beside
</p>
<p>her.
</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing," she answered, startled.
</p>
<p>Involuntarily she crushed a letter in her
</p>
<p>hand, and hid it in the grass beside her.
</p>
<p>"You've had a letter from Jack Howell
</p>
<p>lately, haven't you?" he asked casually, as
</p>
<p>he lighted his pipe.
</p>
<p>"Yes," she answered, with a sigh, "and I
</p>
<p>don't know what to say to it."
</p>
<p>"Well?" Victor blew the smoke from his
</p>
<p>mouth in curling rings. "What do you
</p>
<p>want to say?"
</p>
<p>The girl was silent for a moment, then

<p>with a sudden impulse gave the letter to her

</p>
<p>brother. "Read it, Vic, and tell me," she
</p>
<p>said.
</p>
<p>He took the crumpled thing and opened
</p>
<p>it out. The words were badly blotted by
</p>
<p>tears, he guessed. He read :
</p>
<p>"You say the past has made you an outcast
</p>
<p>from the world. Well, that's not so. And yet,
</p>
<p>until you feel differently, let's have a new world
</p>
<p>of our own. It will be a little one, but I don't
</p>
<p>mind being exclusive. There can never be anyone
</p>
<p>else in the big world for me, so why condemn me
</p>
<p>to a life of miserable loneliness? Come and live
</p>
<p>in my heart and let that be your world. You say
</p>
<p>you can't get away from yourself. Why, yes
</p>
<p>you can, for in this heart of mine no one can fol-
</p>
<p>low you. I realise all you say about the work to
</p>
<p>which you have consecrated yourself; but haven't
</p>
<p>you now done your share? Why not take up a
</p>
<p>new mission in life, and devote yourself to making
</p>
<p>one miserable man happy? Think it over, little
</p>
<p>girl. Don't write me again that nothing can
</p>
<p>change your decision, because you are only fooling
</p>
<p>yourself. I can change it, and I am going to do
</p>
<p>it, too, if we wait to celebrate our; honeymoon in
</p>
<p>the Old Couples' Home. But tell me now that we

<p>need not wait. Say yes !
</p>
<p>324 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>"Write me care of my club, for I may be out
</p>
<p>of town a week or two."
</p>
<p>Victor smiled as he handed back the let-
</p>
<p>ter. "Good old Jack," he said. "He's a
</p>
<p>wonder. Pure gold." A great wave of
</p>
<p>gratitude made his voice husky. "If it
</p>
<p>hadn't been for him, little girl," he said,
</p>
<p>"neither of us would have been here to-day."
</p>
<p>He watched Margaret for a moment, then
</p>
<p>said abruptly, "Don't you love him, Sis?"
</p>
<p>He could see her lovely colour mounting
</p>
<p>from throat to brow, but she only shook her
</p>
<p>head. The grey eyes met his bravely. "It
</p>
<p>would not be right," she answered.
</p>
<p>"Now look here, Margaret," said Victor.
</p>
<p>"You must not go on brooding over the past.
</p>
<p>Jack knows, and he loves you, and wants
</p>
<p>you. There's your answer to that. If
</p>
<p>you're wavering between duty and happi-
</p>
<p>ness, I can settle that for you now. Never
</p>
<p>so long as I live shall you go back to the
</p>
<p>work you've been doing. You've done your
</p>
<p>part and enough. My God, what a part it

<p>has been!" His voice shook, as he hurried

</p>
<p>on. "It is work for men now. You have
</p>
<p>asked my advice, and here it is. If Jack
</p>
<p>Howell means happiness to you, take him.
</p>
<p>You have every right."
</p>
<p>Margaret sat where he left her, and
</p>
<p>watched him disappear through the trees.
</p>
<p>With a sigh, she reached for the letter that
</p>
<p>lay on the ground beside her. Her hand
</p>
<p>brushed a little bunch of forget-me-nots that
</p>
<p>she had thrust into her belt as she came
</p>
<p>through the garden. She took them up
</p>
<p>and held them close, and the quaint words
</p>
<p>of Howell's in The Refuge came to her:
</p>
<p>"A souvenir of our meeting, a nice little
</p>
<p>bunch of forget-me-nots," he had said about
</p>
<p>his wounded fingers. She had a sudden
</p>
<p>vision of the bruised and bleeding hand, and
</p>
<p>with a little cry of love and longing, she
</p>
<p>pressed the blue flowers passionately to her
</p>
<p>lips.
</p>
<p>" 'Out of town a week or two,' the letter
</p>
<p>said. Why," she mused, aloud, "I wonder
</p>
<p>where he is?"

</p>
<p>"Well, he's in the country just now,
</p>
<p>326 THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>getting close to Paradise," said a familiar
</p>
<p>voice among the trees behind her. She
</p>
<p>sprang startled to her feet and turned.
</p>
<p>Jack Howell himself was standing there,
</p>
<p>looking at her with grave, intent eyes.
</p>
<p>For an instant his glance travelled to his
</p>
<p>letter, which had fluttered to the ground,
</p>
<p>then back to her face again. He smiled:
</p>
<p>"Well?" and again he said, as he had said
</p>
<p>once long before, "Well? "
</p>
<p>Victor Holt sat swinging his legs from the
</p>
<p>bars of the pasture fence as Howell, with
</p>
<p>his arm about Margaret, came slowly down
</p>
<p>the wooded road. "Thank God!" he mur-
</p>
<p>mured fervently as he saw them together,
</p>
<p>and perceived the radiance in his sister's
</p>
<p>face.
</p>
<p>"And after all," said Jack, seizing Victor's
</p>
<p>extended hand, "old Clavering has struck it
</p>
<p>right again."
</p>
<p>"Clavering? How's that?" said Victor.
</p>
<p>"Listen to this," Jack said, and gaily

<p>waved a clipping that he extracted from his
</p>

</p>
<p>pocket. "I culled this from the final chap-
</p>
<p>ter of the great story," he explained.
</p>
<p>Victor laughed as Jack began to read
</p>
<p>aloud dramatically:
</p>
<p>' 'As the now beaten and baffled Scarlet
</p>
<p>Banders were led away, shackled to the de-
</p>
<p>tectives, a half sob of triumph broke from
</p>
<p>our heroine's lips. Then the light of love
</p>
<p>flamed into her beautiful grey eyes and she
</p>
<p>turned towards the young reporter waiting
</p>
<p>with outstretched arms to receive her. At
</p>
<p>last she had found her real refuge. With a
</p>
<p>sob of ecstatic joy, the words came from
</p>
<p>her lips ...'""
</p>
<p>"Margaret," cried Victor.
</p>
<p>"The words, 'I love you,' " quoted Mar-
</p>
<p>garet, prettily, in conclusion. "Yes, Victor,
</p>
<p>it's true."
