</p>
<p>It is perhaps matter for just surprise that English
</p>
<p>literature has been so little enriched during the last
</p>
<p>quarter of a century by archivic researches in Italy.
</p>
<p>While these studies have greatly modified the views
</p>
<p>of Italian historians, it may be safely said that, with
</p>
<p>few exceptions, English history of Italy remains sub-
</p>
<p>stantially as it was in 1840. The conspiracy of
</p>
<p>Gianluigi Fieschi, now presented to the English reading
</p>
<p>public, is one of those works which strongly mark the
</p>
<p>progress of historical research in the Italian Peninsula ;
</p>
<p>and though it treats of an episode, that episode is so
</p>
<p>woven into the great events which surrounded it as to
</p>
<p>give a vivid picture of the condition of Italy in the
</p>
<p>sixteenth century. The work has therefore seemed to
</p>
<p>me to have sufficient historical value to merit trans-

<p>lation into our languaoje.
</p>
<p>vi PREFACE.
</p>
<p>I have been more Influenced, however, by a desire to
</p>
<p>make some of those who read only English acquainted
</p>
<p>with an Italian author who seems to me entitled to a
</p>
<p>larger public than his own people. There is no good
</p>
<p>reason why a greater number of Italian writers should
</p>
<p>not be favoured with an English dress ; and it is
</p>
<p>probably more the effect of accident than want of
</p>
<p>merit in Italian writers that their works are much
</p>
<p>more rare in our tongue than those of French and
</p>
<p>German authors. The younger historical writers of
</p>
<p>the time, to w^hich class M. Celesia belongs, have
</p>
<p>pecuhar claims upon our attention, because they are the
</p>
<p>first truly independent wiiters of the Peninsula, and
</p>
<p>their works are the first fruits of liberal institutions and
</p>
<p>a Free Press. It would be only a first homage to their
</p>
<p>worth and sincere devotion to liberal principles to
</p>
<p>translate theu- best works into our language rather than
</p>
<p>absorb the substance of them into our own books. This
</p>
<p>reasoning has induced me to turn aside for a little while
</p>
<p>from the labour of preparing a history of Genoa to
</p>
<p>render M. Celesia's beautiful Italian into an English,
</p>
<p>which I freely confess to be imperfect in comparison
</p>
<p>with the original.
</p>
<p>The first impression of the general reader may be
</p>
<p>that tliis book treats of events so distant in time, and

</p>
<p>so different in moral scenery, from the political and
</p>
<p>PREFACE. Vll
</p>
<p>social conditions in which we live as to afford little or
</p>
<p>no instruction to us. No history, except that of one's
</p>
<p>own country, affords precise forms in which to mould
</p>
<p>the present ; and what are called historical parallels do
</p>
<p>not really exist, since every series of political events
</p>
<p>has peculiar elements which make close analogies with
</p>
<p>any other series impossible. Those who quote events
</p>
<p>in the history of other times and peoples as containing
</p>
<p>precise instruction for present national action usually
</p>
<p>deceive their auditors all the more completely from
</p>
<p>being deceived themselves. It is only in the abundant
</p>
<p>matter of general principles that history contains lessons
</p>
<p>of political wisdom. In this sense the work before the
</p>
<p>reader is not without valuable instruction. M. Celesia
</p>
<p>has given us a view of the social and political condition
</p>
<p>of the masses who have too often been excluded from
</p>
<p>history because they had been excluded from power in
</p>
<p>the state.
</p>
<p>We see, in fact, some painful scenes of that long
</p>
<p>tragedy which ended in the disfranchisement of the
</p>
<p>Italians, in the very period when most other European
</p>
<p>nations were making the bases of their institutions
</p>
<p>broader by enlarging the liberties of their peoples ; and
</p>
<p>we see clearly that two vast despotisms  one reposing
</p>
<p>on a fiction of the continued life of the Roman Empire

</p>
<p>Christian Authority  conspiring now together, now
</p>
<p>against each other, bewildered the intellect and de-
</p>
<p>stroyed the political vitality of Italy, gradually reducing
</p>
<p>her to a mere geographical expression. The people
</p>
<p>straggled in vain, partly because they struggled blindly,
</p>
<p>partly because a pernicious error placed them in
</p>
<p>exceptional conditions by stripping them of a part of
</p>
<p>their rights avowedly in the interest of humanity at
</p>
<p>large. So far this struggle was peculiar in form ; but
</p>
<p>at bottom it was a struggle for popular rights, and its
</p>
<p>disastrous close is here shown to have been due to no
</p>
<p>fault of the people themselves. It is just here that less
</p>
<p>than justice has been done to the Italians, and this
</p>
<p>work well illustrates the stupendous falsehood which
</p>
<p>slew them.
</p>
<p>Our interest in this error might be less if it Avere
</p>
<p>dead ; but it lives and embarasses the Italians of our
</p>
<p>own day. We have just been gravely informed by a
</p>
<p>French statesmen"' that Rome does not belong to Italy,
</p>
<p>but to the whole catholic world ; and the statement is a
</p>
<p>key not only to current Italian difficulties but also to the
</p>
<p>failure of the nation to keep pace with the rest of
</p>
<p>Europe in the sixteenth century. Then, more than
</p>
<p>now, other nations conceived themselves to have a
</p>
<p>mission to preserve institutions wliich Italy was dis-

<p>posed to condemn and abolish. Then a larger number
</p>
<p>of Italians than now were bewildered by the legal or
</p>
<p>historical claim set np for a dead Empire and a
</p>
<p>Christian Church founded upon force, and in their
</p>
<p>bewilderment went over to their enemies. But below
</p>
<p>all this, a brave people struck manful blows for their
</p>
<p>salvation, and when they fell were suffocated with the
</p>
<p>terrible doctrine that Italy does not belong to herself.
</p>
<p>The statement of Count Persigny was and is, in its
</p>
<p>political significance, when applied to Italian politics,
</p>
<p>exactly like a declaration that London does not belong
</p>
<p>to Eno;land or Paris to France.
</p>
<p>I do not forget that the falsehood has been acted
</p>
<p>upon as a truth in Italy for some centuries ; but
</p>
<p>political piracy cannot win the moral approval of our
</p>
<p>times on the plea that it has been practised for a long
</p>
<p>period. The real effect of the doctrine, whatever be
</p>
<p>its force from a history made by applying it, is to
</p>
<p>condemn a whole people to a certain dejDcndence on
</p>
<p>other nations, to give France, Austria and Spain  or to
</p>
<p>go back to the sixteenth century, France and the

</p>
<p>this was done. It was cruel  too cruel to be described
</p>
<p>X PREFACE.
</p>
<p> ^wlien history accused the fallen of cowardice, in-
</p>
<p>capacity for liberty and superstitous devotion to Kome.
</p>
<p>From such atrocious slanders, the Italians of the
</p>
<p>sixteenth century deserve a vindication. M. Celesia
</p>
<p>has felt this part of his office so warmly that his word
</p>
<p>may seem those of an advocate rather than of an
</p>
<p>historian to those who forget the wrongs done to his
</p>
<p>people in the name of history. But he who fully
</p>
<p>weighs the injustice against which our author protests
</p>
<p>will rather wonder at the moderation and critical
</p>
<p>calmness of the greater part of the book than complain
</p>
<p>of the glow of honest indignation which lights up some
</p>
<p>of his periods.
</p>
<p>The critical reader will regret that the work is not
</p>
<p>fortified by more copious references. The truth is that
</p>
<p>it is not the fashion in Italy to quote authorities, and
</p>
<p>the citations given were prepared by the author for this
</p>
<p>edition. I have added a few explanatory foot-notes ;
</p>
<p>but the reader is referred for fuller information regard-
</p>
<p>ing events in earlier Genoese history to a forthcoming-
</p>
<p>work on that subject.

</p>
<p>It would be difficult to find in the history of the
</p>
<p>sixteenth century a name more fiercely assailed than
</p>
<p>that of Gianluigi Fieschi. From Bonfadio down to
</p>
<p>the most recent historians, the Count of Lavagna has
</p>
<p>received the same treatment at the hands of our writers
</p>
<p>which the learned vulgar are accustomed to give to
</p>
<p>Catiline. This levity of judgment is a new proof that
</p>
<p>history is too high a pursuit for servile minds.
</p>
<p>The classic invectives of Cicero and the glittering
</p>
<p>falsehoods of Sallust, both ^vritten with masterly
</p>
<p>eloquence, and their echo taken up by inferior writers
</p>
<p>have disfigured the manly form of Sergius, and his
</p>
<p>cause, supported by the most generous and cultivated
</p>
<p>Komans, has come down to us described as the base
</p>
<p>plot of abandoned men.
</p>
<p>Catiline could not have been base. He was illus-
</p>
<p>trious by birth, well-known for his talents and powerful
</p>
<p>on account of his numerous dependants and friends.
</p>
<p>He stood on the last round of the ladder leading to the

</p>
<p>by Antonius Geta, Lentulus, Cetliegus and even by
</p>
<p>Caesar who was no stranger to the conspiracy. Crassus
</p>
<p>favoured him, though he afterwards turned informer
</p>
<p>against the conspirators. Entire colonies and Munici-
</p>
<p>palities supported him. In upper Spain, Gneus Piso,
</p>
<p>in Mauritania, Publius Sittius Nucerinus and the
</p>
<p>legions were his partisans ; in fine, he was the head of
</p>
<p>all the reformers of Italy and Gaul.
</p>
<p>I do not excuse his violence, his disorderly life and
</p>
<p>his vices ; though we know of these only through his
</p>
<p>enemies. But his aims were unquestionably high and
</p>
<p>noble. Koman liberty was buried in his tomb and not
</p>
<p>even the dao;o;er of Junius Brutus could recall her to
</p>
<p>life. I hold it incontestable that the movement, far
</p>
<p>from being a plot of reckless men, was general and
</p>
<p>spontaneous towards that freedom which Lucius Sylla
</p>
<p>had extinguished in blood ; a movement for which
</p>
<p>there was crying urgency in Italy, where crowds of
</p>
<p>slaves were supplanting the Latin races, and throughout
</p>
<p>the dominions of the Kepublic. In vain have cunning
</p>
<p>rhetoricians taught us to execrate the name of the great
</p>
<p>Koman, the last of the Tribunes. He has left for
</p>
<p>history a page written with his own blood which is
</p>
<p>more lasting than all envy. It shows us one who fell
</p>
<p>dead on the same ground where he steadfastly fought,
</p>
<p>displaying in his last hour an heroism which is incon-
</p>
<p>sistent with the crimes coupled with his name.
</p>
<p>Cicero himself tells us that the friendship of Catiline
</p>
<p>had such fascinations that he had barely escaped its

<p>influence. It may be true that his pallid face, his

<p>AUTHORS INTRODUCTION". XIX
</p>
<p>fierce eyes and his nervous step, now quick, now slow,
</p>
<p>terrified the publicans and patricians of Rome ; but none
</p>
<p>can believe that he butchered his own son, immolated
</p>
<p>victims to the silver eagle of Marius, or handed round
</p>
<p>in nocturnal conventicles a cup full of foaming blood.
</p>
<p>Catiline was a bad man because he was vanquished ;
</p>
<p>but Salvator Rosa, the soldier and painter of Masaniello,
</p>
<p>when he drew Catiline as a stern and magnanimous
</p>
<p>man did not believe him a low plotter, and the great
</p>
<p>captain of our century declared that he preferred the
</p>
<p>part of the great Latin conspirator to that of the
</p>
<p>versatile Tully.
</p>
<p>The character of the Count of Lavagna has been
</p>
<p>depicted in similar colours by servile writers skilful in
</p>
<p>inventing calumnies. Catiline and Fieschi had the
</p>
<p>same ambition and a common aim. The former, in
</p>
<p>his familiar letters to Lentulus which 'were published
</p>
<p>in the Senate, declared that no venal ambition led him
</p>
<p>to make war. He said that his estates were security
</p>
<p>for his debts and that the liberality and wealth of
</p>
<p>Orestilla and his daughter would provide for any
</p>
<p>deficiency. He averred, he was impelled by wrongs
</p>
<p>and slanders, that he made the cause of the unfortunate
</p>
<p>his own, because he was defrauded of the fruit of his
</p>
<p>labours, and, while he was falsely suspected, was forced
</p>
<p>to see base men taking his place.
</p>
<p>The same is true of Fieschi, whose death, Gianettino
</p>
<p>Doria had sworn. In Genoa, not less than in Rome, a
</p>
<p>partisan contest between the nobles and the people had

<p>lasted for centuries. Here, after the civil conflagrations,
</p>
<p>XX AUTHORS INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>as after the scourgings of Rome by Marius and Sylla,
</p>
<p>liberty gradually expired. In botli Republics, the
</p>
<p>people were bowed down by the insolence of the great.
</p>
<p>They were deprived of all share in the government, and
</p>
<p>corrupt ambition had unbounded sway. In Liguria,
</p>
<p>Andrea Doria had completed the triumph of the party
</p>
<p>of the nobles and imperialists and the ruin of popular
</p>
<p>liberty. Though he forbore to assume a princely title,
</p>
<p>he was a true king in authority, his nephew aspired to
</p>
<p>regal honours, and every popular right was trampled
</p>
<p>down by the Spanish power. According to Bonfadio
</p>
<p>this subjection was too bitter for the great soul of the
</p>
<p>Count Lavagna long to endure the humiliation. But
</p>
<p>his enemies wrote, and by a thousand channels circula-
</p>
<p>ted, the most incredible things as parts of his designs : 
</p>
<p>That he attempted by base intrigues to ruin the Re-
</p>
<p>public, that he aimed to seduce it to servitude to his
</p>
<p>family or to France, to exterminate the Doria family,
</p>
<p>to lay bloody and felonious hands on the bank of St.
</p>
<p>George, to put the city to foe and sack. The decrees
</p>
<p>and official reports of the Republic do not warrant such
</p>
<p>statements, and a theory more honourable to him is
</p>
<p>justified by the gentleness of his character, by the
</p>
<p>Guelph traditions of his house, by the fact that he
</p>
<p>prevented the murder of Doria, in his palace, and by
</p>
<p>the conspiracy itself, the fury of which was directed
</p>
<p>against the ships of Doria, sparing those of the
</p>
<p>Republic.
</p>
<p>It was necessary for Doria that black designs should

</p>
<p>would have been unjustifiable. The slander was profit-
</p>
<p>able also to the Spanish Ccesar, for it took away from
</p>
<p>his path a powerful family of)posed to the Aragonese
</p>
<p>power in Italy. And as matter of fact, these idle tales,
</p>
<p>written in Genoa and difiused in France and Spain,
</p>
<p>were never believed among us. The greater part of
</p>
<p>the patricians did not credit them for they were
</p>
<p>Fieschi's friends and would have saved him if the
</p>
<p>overbearing spirit of Doria had not imposed his will
</p>
<p>upon the senate. Such slanders found no credit with
</p>
<p>the people, who placed their love upon that philan-
</p>
<p>thropic family and perpetuated its memory in national
</p>
<p>songs,
</p>
<p>Catiline and Fieschi intended to awaken in their
</p>
<p>native lands the love of exj^iring liberty, and in that
</p>
<p>aim they had the support of many nobles and of the
</p>
<p>people. The pride of Roman patricians could bend to
</p>
<p>an alliance with the people, but they scorned* to share
</p>
<p>their rights with foreign slaves. The Count of Lavagna
</p>
<p>grasped the hand of the people, but he refused the
</p>
<p>alliance of France. This fact testifies for both to the
</p>
<p>honesty of their designs ; for to a traitor all paths are
</p>
<p>good so they but lead to his end.
</p>
<p>Catiline, slandered by Cicero upon the rostrum,
</p>
<p>fulminates in his turn against his detractor, and though
</p>
<p>he quits Rome unattended, his exit is imposing and
</p>
<p>momentous. Fieschi, bending to the necessities of his
</p>
<p>time, found more quiet and secret paths to his end ;
</p>
<p>and when accused by the minister of Caesar with

</p>
<p>seeking to foment a revolution, he confronted Andrea
</p>
<p>XXU AUTHORS INTRODUCTTOy.
</p>
<p>Doria with a frankness which eluded the Admiral's
</p>
<p>keen vigilance. From the blood of Catiline sprung
</p>
<p>the dictatorship of Caesar ; fi'om that of Fieschi, the
</p>
<p>oligarchic government and the Spanish dominion in
</p>
<p>Genoa.
</p>
<p>Doria, becoming the supporter and partisan of
</p>
<p>Charles V. and Phillip II. prevented Genoa from
</p>
<p>entering into the league of the Italian Eepubhcs
</p>
<p>against the Spanish yoke. Genoa, united to the enemies
</p>
<p>of Florence and Siena in the time of those memorable
</p>
<p>sieges, allied with the enemies of Naples when that
</p>
<p>peoj^le was rising for liberty, the friend of all the
</p>
<p>enemies of Italy, dates from that period her unfortunate
</p>
<p>decline. The movement of Fieschi, if he had accepted
</p>
<p>the alliance of France, might have averted the catas-
</p>
<p>trophe. The French and Eepublican league might
</p>
<p>have extirpated the Spanish power in the Peninsula,
</p>
<p>and saved Italy from forging her own chains. It might
</p>
<p>have spared Genoa her struggles with the Barbary
</p>
<p>states, the revolt of the Corsicans, the decline of her
</p>
<p>commerce with the East and the most disastrous of all
</p>
<p>her civil tumults.
</p>
<p>The Genoese people struggled long against that fatal
</p>
<p>alliance, cemented with their blood, which Fieschi
</p>
<p>strove to break. They left no means untried to dissolve
</p>
<p>it, using now supplication, now the sword and the
</p>
<p>scaffold. And for more than two centuries, a half
</p>
<p>subdued populace never grew weary of pouring its
</p>
<p>indignant complaints into the ear of the nobility. I

</p>
<p>courses have been reported, andjudgedby their enemies
</p>
<p>and by the faction which they strove to displace from
</p>

<p>dispenses praise and blame, and gives each man that

<p>place in the esteem of posterity which his works merit.
</p>
<p>From the earliest times our country was lacerated
</p>
<p>by two hostile factions. There were annalists and
</p>
<p>writers Vvdio recorded and magnified the exploits of
</p>
<p>those belonging to their party and silently passed over
</p>
<p>the praiseworthy actions of their political opponents.
</p>
<p>Procopius and lornandes represent the two creeds
</p>
<p>which in their time were contending for the suj^port of
</p>
<p>the nation. Anastaius is the biographer of the Popes,
</p>
<p>as Paul Diacono is of the Longobardic kings. In every
</p>
<p>province there were Malaspini and Dino Compagni,
</p>
<p>imperialists, fighting against the Guelph and Pepublican
</p>
<p>spirit of the three Villani. From the union of these
</p>
<p>hostile elements come forth the critical historian of the
</p>
<p>nation  Macchiavelli. But when the Germanic irrup-
</p>
<p>tion cut the nerves of the Latin traditions, when
</p>
<p>Charles V. and Andrea Doria reestablished the foreign
</p>
<p>power in Italy, the Guelph spirit was silenced, the
</p>
<p>Journal killed, the Chronicle and ofiicial falsehoods
</p>
<p>so misrepresented events as to render history nearly
</p>
<p>impossible. John Mark Burigozzo, a Lombard shop-

<p>ZXIV AUTHORS INTRODUCTION".
</p>
<p>need of great caution in reading the verdict of a history
</p>
<p>written with the sword. " Woe to the vanquished " in
</p>
<p>history as on the battle-field. Corrupt ages praise
</p>
<p>successful crimes, and it is only by great effort that
</p>
<p>after times emancipate themselves from these servile
</p>
<p>adulations. There is a coward instinct in man which
</p>
<p>prompts him to applaud force and despise the fallen.
</p>
<p>The conscientious historian should enter his free protest
</p>
<p>against such dishonourable acquiescence in forced
</p>
<p>verdicts. It is time that hivStory should be relieved
</p>
<p>from the tyranny of eloquent but mendacious tongues,
</p>
<p>and many powerful ones should be deposed from ill-
</p>
<p>gotten thrones. It is time to ask of many who have
</p>
<p>been called heroes what use they made of their swords
</p>
<p>and how they served Italy, and to concede  the suprem.e
</p>
<p>right of misfortune  a tardy tribute of regret to one
</p>
<p>who fell victim to a high and generous purpose.
</p>
<p>What is the verdict recorded against Fieschi ?
</p>
<p>Among the "v\Titers who were his contemporaries stand
</p>
<p>foremost, Bonfadio, CamjDanaceo, Sigonio, Capelloni,

<p>Foglietta, Mascardi and Casoni. I do not mention

<p>foreigners, first among whom are Tuano and the

<p>they have all followed with the assiduity of copyists the
</p>
<p>earlier historians, making no efi'ort to study the public
</p>
<p>archives or even to criticise the text which they copied.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is important to give the reader some

<p>the true from the false. Nor can this be done without
</p>
<p>carefully weighing the credibility of authors who have
</p>
<p>gone this way before us and taking account of the
</p>
<p>passions which governed them when they wrote.
</p>
<p>The first historian of Fieschi was Bonfadio who was
</p>
<p>employed by the senate to write the annals of the
</p>
<p>Eepublic. He was a witness of the events which he
</p>
<p>described and on the very night of the rising, he went
</p>
<p>to the senate in company with Giovanni Battista
</p>
<p>Grimaldi. Yet we can yield him little faith ; since,
</p>
<p>^vriting at the command of the government, he could not
</p>
<p>do less than speak harshly of the government's enemies.
</p>
<p>He confesses that he had not in his hands the records
</p>
<p>of the conspirators' trial. He ignores many facts, and
</p>
<p>never names the accomplices of Fieschi, scarcely sus-
</p>
<p>pecting that there were any. Having a mania for classic
</p>
<p>imitation, and borne away by the current of his times,
</p>
<p>he depicts Gianluigi as a man thirsting for base
</p>
<p>deeds and for blood ; so, that if his immortal pages
</p>
<p>served to render the memory of Fieschi odious at a
</p>
<p>time when men had little concern for the honour of the
</p>
<p>vanquished, they are certainly too careless and too
</p>
<p>partial to satisfy the future. The unfortunate author,
</p>
<p>who was truthful in all other matters and failed in this

<p>only, because it treated of a plot against the powerful

<p>Doria, reaped bitter fruits for his great bias against

</p>
<p>says, " sprung from noble stock. Both were crushed
</p>
<p>under the ruin they plotted for others. In the one, a
</p>
<p>fierce look, a sanguinary countenance ; in the other, a
</p>
<p>singular beiiuty and a virginal candour. The Roman
</p>
<p>was stained with bloody and licentiourj deeds ; the
</p>
<p>Genoese bore the fame of o'oodncFjs of heart and STace
</p>
<p>of manners. The Roman was vero;iao- towards age :
</p>
<p>the Genoese was in the freshness of his youth, yet he
</p>
<p>surpassed the conspirator of the Ti])er as much in
</p>
<p>deceitfulness as Catiline excelled him in warlike
</p>
<p>exploits."
</p>
<p>If on minor points the narration of this T\Titer is
</p>
<p>more accurate, it still bears the seal of the deg^raded
</p>
<p>time in which it was written. Thoui]!;h the author
</p>
<p>professes to have taken great pains to discover the
</p>
<p>truth, having spent a long time in Genoa for that
</p>
<p>purpose, it is very easy to see that he did not escape
</p>
<p>the contagion of party feeling and of the malevolence
</p>
<p>of the faction then dominant in Liguria. It is not
</p>
<p>strange, therefore, that he finds a mean and avaricious
</p>
<p>spirit in Gianluigi, while he describes Gianettino as an
</p>
<p>illustrious victim, rather, as the most virtuous knight
</p>
<p>of all Christendom.
</p>
<p>Carlo Sigonio, in his life of Andrea Doria, and,
</p>
<p>among Genoese writers, Oberto Foglietto have treated
</p>
<p>the matter with elegance of diction but with unblushing
</p>
<p>plagiarism.
</p>
<p>The same may be said of Lorenzo Capelloni, who

<p>described the conspiracy of Fieschi in a report to

<p>Charles V. He was too devoted to Csesar, and to Doria,

<p>AUTHORS INTRODUCTION. XXVll
</p>
<p>whose life he TVTote, not to imitate the others whom
</p>
<p>we have mentioned in treating the attempt of Fieschi
</p>
<p>as a plot of like character with that of Cybo which he
</p>
<p>also described.
</p>
<p>Agostino Mascardi, who was more of a rhetorician
</p>
<p>than an historian, tells ns nothing new. Casoni was
</p>
<p>less devoted to the Spanish power and therefore more
</p>
<p>humane towards Fieschi, but he adopted without
</p>
<p>question the opinion professed by the party in power
</p>
<p>who never opened the archives of the state for the
</p>
<p>study of the historian.
</p>
<p>We therefore conclude that a prudent and impartial
</p>
<p>criticism forbids us to give full faith to those who have
</p>
<p>given to Count Fieschi a dishonourable place in history.
</p>
<p>In our opinion two qualifications are essential to the
</p>
<p>historian :  That he be able to collect the most accurate
</p>
<p>accounts of the facts, and that party spirit do not
</p>
<p>cloud the serenity of his mind. The writers whom we
</p>
<p>have mentioned lack these credentials. In fact, after
</p>
<p>studying the annals of the sixteenth century, we are
</p>
<p>satisfied that most of them were ignorant of the true
</p>
<p>causes of events. Sometimes they knew only a part of
</p>
<p>the facts ; sometimes, acting under the influence of
</p>
<p>personal or political jealousy, they betrayed the truth
</p>
<p>by silence, by misrepresentation or by additions of
</p>
<p>what would serve their own purposes or the wishes of
</p>
<p>their masters.
</p>
<p>The reader must judge whether we have truly
</p>
<p>balanced the account.

<p>possible Fieschi should have had truthful historians in
</p>
<p>the provinces ruled by Charles V. It was not to be
</p>
<p>expected in Genoa, where the supreme authority of the
</p>
<p>Dorias compelled even the least servile writers to the
</p>
<p>most skilful management of conscience and speech.
</p>
<p>Neither in Tuscany, where the seeds of the Mcdicean
</p>
<p>tyranny were already springing up ; not in Lombardy,
</p>
<p>which was the battle-ground of the two opposing
</p>
<p>factions ; not in the kingdom of Naples tossed like a
</p>
<p>foot-ball from one master to another, but at the moment
</p>
<p>in the grasp of Caesar. Finally, not in Rome where the
</p>
<p>Spanish government, in its war to the death upon the
</p>
<p>spirit of civil and religious liberty, found a swift
</p>
<p>accomplice in the Papal court which employed the zeal
</p>
<p>and devotion of its inquisitors in consigning to the
</p>
<p>flames both books and their authors. It is enough
</p>
<p>that no writer in Italy was permitted to answer the
</p>
<p>blind devotee of Rome, Baronius.
</p>
<p>A few noble spirits arose to tell the truth of the

<p>Boccalini and Tassoni ; nevertheless in the period

<p>between Charles V. and the middle of the 1 7th century
</p>
<p>no true light of history shone on the Peninsula.
</p>
<p>Learned and literary men lived in the courts, then

<p>valued for their promptness in serving masters than

</p>
<p>from the path of duty. Truth was banished from
</p>
<p>books because it displeased our masters^ and history
</p>
<p>was sure to be smothered if it contained more than
</p>
<p>panegyric. Spanish wordiness had corrupted liberal
</p>
<p>studies and Italians were no longer honestly indignant
</p>
<p>against the oppressors of their country. They de-
</p>
<p>scended from employing their imaginations in intellectual
</p>
<p>creations to pandering to the senses. Literary enter-
</p>
<p>tainments, like falcons and buffoons, served for the
</p>
<p>sport of courtiers, as an instrument of corruption
</p>
<p>rather than a stimulant to generous pursuits. Intellect
</p>
<p>being thus prostrated, Fieschi could find no historian
</p>
<p>courageous enough to clear away the falsehoods that
</p>
<p>blackened his' fame and constrain his calumniators to
</p>
<p>an honest confession. Cybo, Farnese, and whoever else,
</p>
<p>following the footsteps of Fieschi, opposed at the price
</p>
<p>of their lives Spanish influence, shared the historical
</p>
<p>misfortune of the Count of Lavao-na.
</p>
<p>o
</p>
<p>It was necessary, then, to rewrite this history and
</p>
<p>I resolved to attempt the task. There are subjects
</p>
<p>(and the conspiracy of Fieschi is one of them) which
</p>
<p>seen from a distance fill us with apprehension, but
</p>
<p>when we approach and handle them, the alarm which
</p>
<p>possessed us generally disappears. I approached my
</p>
<p>subject with honest boldness and having studied it
</p>
<p>intimately, I have dared to rebel against the common
</p>
<p>opinion of the learned. If it were necessary to quote
</p>
<p>all the authorities for a conviction so opposed to the
</p>
<p>current of corrupted history the list would be too long.

<p>bear me witness that very little within the range of the

</p>
<p>remark t]\at the Archives of Madrid and Paris have
</p>
<p>furnished me with foreign notices of the revolts of
</p>
<p>Fieschi and his partisans, and that more perfect in-
</p>
<p>formation has been obtained from the Archives of
</p>
<p>Genoa, Florence, Parma, Massa and Carrara, and from
</p>
<p>some codexes and manuscripts which once belonged to
</p>
<p>Cardinal Adriano Fieschi (the last of the Savignone
</p>
<p>branch of the Fieschi family) whose heir, Count
</p>
<p>Alessandro Negri di S. Front, kindly permitted me to
</p>
<p>consult them at my pleasure. I render him my most

<p>hearty thanks. I have drawn other materials from the

<p>writinixs of the sacred colleo;e of Padua in favour of
</p>
<p>the Republic and the pleadi]\gs of the famous jurists
</p>
<p>who sustained the Fieschi party. Many other notices
</p>
<p>have been taken from private libraries in Genoa, which
</p>
<p>are at once so numerous and so difficult of access.
</p>
<p>Some documents very favourable to the cause of Fieschi

<p>but the greater part of them were already familiar to

<p>removed mcany a stain from the name of Fieschi and
</p>
<p>lashed his detractors with the severest condemnation,'^^
</p>
<p>A modest cultivator of peaceful studies, I do not fear
</p>
<p>that any will suspect me of aiming to destroy the
</p>
<p>reverence due to a great name ; or that I shall receive
</p>
<p>the sentence pronounced by Richelieu, who, on reading
</p>
<p>the conspiracy of Fieschi written by Cardinal de Retz
</p>
<p>in his youth, prophesied that the author would develop
</p>
<p>a turbulent and revolutionary spirit.
</p>
<p>My humble condition and the honesty of my in-
</p>
<p>tentions render me safe from similiar vacticinations.
</p>
<p>Though in my opinions upon the conspiracy I depart
</p>
<p>from tlie paths beaten by other writers, it is not
</p>
<p>without adequate reasons. I. feel that the religion
</p>
<p>of truth, has had hitherto too few worshippers, that
</p>
<p>reverence for tlie unfortunate great of Italy .has been
</p>
<p>long put under ban, and do not hesitate to say that if
</p>
<p>w]iat I shall dare to write was not unknown by others
</p>
<p>it was most certainly concealed. What were the aims
</p>
<p>of Fieschi ? What of Andrea Doria ? Whitlier tended
</p>
<p>the uprisiiig of the people ? Who breathed life into the
</p>
<p>cause of national independence ? To these questions^
</p>
<p>so far as I know, no one has yet made a sufficient
</p>
<p>answer ; and, indeed, how can one write of Fieschi and
</p>
<p>Doria without investigating their personal motives,
</p>
<p>prying into the secrets of their hearts ? Our historians,
</p>
<p>copying each other and compressing the tragedy of a
</p>
<p>century into a few pages, have given us only the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy and the uprising, that is the least philosophic
</p>
<p>moment. For us, history begins where the strife ends.

</p>
<p>instead the ear is saluted with the songs of peaceful
</p>
<p>burghers whose humble ambition finds content in
</p>
<p>gathering the fruit of the vines, weaving their nets,
</p>
<p>and drawing from their famous caves that slate which
</p>
<p>covers all the roofs of Liguria.
</p>
<p>The banks of that stream which our ancestors called
</p>
<p>Entella, and we moderns Lavagna (from the name of
</p>
<p>the adjacent commune), have preserved, through the
</p>
<p>changes of centuries, their wonderful charms. It rises
</p>
<p>in the humble valley of Fontanabuona, is enriched by
</p>
<p>numerous tributaries from vales on either hand, and
</p>
<p>slips quietly into the sea after a course of only twenty-
</p>
<p>four miles.
</p>
<p>Some tell us that in ages which have no authentic
</p>
<p>history the ancient Libarna was here, and that the
</p>
<p>name was afterwards corrupted into Lavagna ; but our
</p>
<p>modern geographers do not accept the opinion. It is
</p>
<p>certain that Lavagna became the seat of a count of
</p>
<p>that name, who, about the year one thousand of our
</p>
<p>era, ruled over the contiguous districts of Sestri,
</p>
<p>Zoagli, Eapallo, Varese, and a great part of Chiavari.
</p>
<p>From this epoch, for many centuries, the history of the
</p>
<p>whole region was absorbed in that of the great family
</p>
<p>who ruled that portion of Liguria. The origin of these
</p>
<p>Counts is lost in mediaeval darkness. Giustiniani,
</p>
<p>Prierio, Panza, Sansovino, Betussi, and Ciaccone believe
</p>
<p>that they came of the stock of the Dukes of Bourgogne
</p>
<p>or of the Princes of Bavaria, and they affirm that the
</p>
<p>counts were called Flisci, because they watched over

</p>
<p>the collection of the imperial taxes. On this point
</p>
<p>THE COUNTS OF LAVAGNA. 3
</p>
<p>nothing can be said with certainty. For our part,
</p>
<p>remembering that from the time of Otto the Great
</p>
<p>four powerful families ruled over all Liguria  that is
</p>
<p>the Counts of Lavagna and Ventimiglia, and the
</p>
<p>Marquises of Savona and Malaspina  we are led to
</p>
<p>believe that the Fieschi, like the Estensi^ Pallavicini,
</p>
<p>Malaspina, and many other powerful houses, had a
</p>
<p>Longobardic derivation. This belief is supported by
</p>
<p>the fact that the Counts of Lavagna ruled with
</p>
<p>Longobardic laws, and drew from that nation,
</p>
<p>their Christian names as Oberto, Ariberto, Valperto,
</p>
<p>Rubaldo, Sinibaldo, Tebaldo, and others of like
</p>
<p>formation, which we find on every page of their
</p>
<p>family records. The Longobards ruled almost a
</p>
<p>century and a half in Liguria, and it is probable
</p>
<p>that many families of that nation founded feuds and
</p>
<p>took firm root with their estates and castles.
</p>
<p>It is certain that the first count of the name clearly
</p>
<p>mentioned in history was a certain Tedisio, son of
</p>
<p>Oberto, who ruled the county of Lavagna in 992, and
</p>
<p>who had previously accompanied King Arduinus
</p>
<p>through all his campaigns. From him descended, in the
</p>
<p>right line, Rubaldo, Tedisio IL, Rubaldo IL, Alberto,
</p>
<p>and Ruffino. In the will of Rufiino (1177) the name
</p>
<p>Fieschi occurs for the first time.* Then followed
</p>
<p>Ugone and Tedisio III., brother of Pope Innocent IV.
</p>
<p>It is not our purpose to speak of their genealogy, but
</p>
<p>we refer the curious reader to works on that subject.

</p>
<p>4 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGI FIESCHI.
</p>
<p>The Counts of Lavagna, at a very early period,,
</p>
<p>enlarged their j iirisdiction by acquiring many surround-
</p>
<p>ing castles and feuds. The growth of their power was
</p>
<p>so rapid that the Genoese people, in the earliest clays
</p>
<p>of the communal system (1008), found it necessary to
</p>
<p>put a check on the increasing influence of this family.
</p>
<p>The Genoese attempted to take possession of the castle
</p>
<p>of Caloso, the first seat of the Fieschi, and then held
</p>
<p>by Count San Salvatore. The Fieschi anticipated and
</p>
<p>foiled the movement by pushing forward their conquests
</p>
<p>so as to include in their dominions Nei, Panesi, Zerli,
</p>
<p>and Eoccamaggiore. This conflict gave rise to long
</p>
<p>and indecisive struggles, which did not end until the
</p>
<p>Genoese army, retm^ning from the Eomagna in 1133,
</p>
<p>marched through Lavagna, dismantled its fortresses,
</p>
<p>and, to secm-e the obedience of the Counts, fortified
</p>
<p>Kivarolo, in the very lieart of the country. The Counts
</p>
<p>rallied from the effects of this staggering blow, and,
</p>
<p>by dint of extraordinary address and courage, recovered

</p>
<p>When Frederick I. besieged Milan, the Fieschi went
</p>
<p>to his camp to pay him homage, and the Emperor, by
</p>
<p>royal decree, dated the 1st of September, 1158, invested
</p>
<p>Count Kubaldo Fieschi with all the ancient lands and
</p>
<p>rights of his family.
</p>
<p>This patent conferred upon the Counts the following

<p>territories and privileges :

<p>lield allodial properties in tlie three plebeian hamlets
</p>
<p>of Lavagna near the sea, Sestri, and Varese ; and
</p>
<p>finally the wood which has the following boundaries 
</p>
<p>from the Croce di Lambe to Monte Tomar, thence to
</p>
<p>the bridge of Varvo, lake Fercia and Selvasola, return-
</p>
<p>ing to the point of departure at Croce di Lambe.
</p>
<p>The Fieschi were thus rendered independent of the
</p>
<p>republic, and, about 1170, having made a secret treaty
</p>
<p>with Obizzo Malaspina and the counts of Da Passano,
</p>
<p>they invested Eapallo, and put Genoa to such straits
</p>
<p>that she was forced to ask aid of the marquises of
</p>
<p>Monferrato, Gavi, and Bosco. The soldiers of the allies
</p>
<p>under the command of Enrico il Guercio, Marquis of
</p>
<p>Savona, punished the contumacy and audacity of the
</p>
<p>Fieschi.
</p>
<p>Finally, to compress much into few words, the
</p>
<p>commune of Genoa, on the 25th of June, 1198, made
</p>
<p>a treaty with the Counts of Lavagna. The latter
</p>
<p>bound themselves to content their ambition with the
</p>
<p>possession of Lavagna, Sestri, and Rivarolo, and the
</p>
<p>commune conferred many honours and privileges on
</p>
<p>the counts, especially reaffirming the rights conveyed
</p>
<p>to the family by the Emperor. The Fieschi further
</p>
<p>pledged themselves never more to draw sword against
</p>
<p>the city of Genoa or her allies, the Bishop of Bobbio,
</p>
<p>and the Lords of Gavi, and to l^ecome citizens of Genoa.*

</p>
<p>sole head of the whole family, but after his death
</p>
<p>they separated into many branches. The principal line
</p>
<p>retained the name Fieschi ; the others were called
</p>
<p>Scorza, Eavaschieri, Delia Torre, Casanova, Secchi,
</p>
<p>Bianchi, Cogorno, and Pinelli.
</p>
<p>It is not our intention to speak further of the junior
</p>
<p>branches. The treaty with Genoa marks the close of
</p>
<p>the wars between the commune and the Fieschi, and
</p>
<p>the beginning of our domestic divisions, which for
</p>
<p>centuries weakened the republic, and compelled the
</p>
<p>lover of repose to seek it in voluntary exile. Those
</p>
<p>who adhered to the empire were called Masclierati,
</p>
<p>and the opposite faction Rampini, headed by Fieschi.
</p>
<p>It would be a long work and one outside of our
</p>
<p>purpose to describe the various changes of fortune
</p>
<p>through which the Counts of Lavagna passed, tossing
</p>
<p>up and down in the fury of political strife ; but it is
</p>
<p>note-worthy that they always maintained the character
</p>
<p>of defenders of popular liberty.
</p>
<p>When Galeazzo Sforza was in power, they lived at
</p>
<p>Rome in exile, and their castles were occupied by
</p>
<p>ducal garrisons; but after the death (1476) of this
</p>
<p>tyrant, they rushed to arms, assailed the ducal palace
</p>
<p>in Genoa, and forced Giovanni Pallavicini, governor
</p>
<p>under Sforza, to take refuge in the fortress of Castelletto.
</p>
<p>Having made themselves masters of the city, far from
</p>
<p>assuming supreme powers, they immediately summoned
</p>
<p>the great parliament of the citizens who elected eight
</p>
<p>captains of liberty, six of whom were taken from the

</p>
<p>and Matteo Fieschi were placed at tlie head of the
</p>
<p>army ; but to defend the city from the threatened
</p>
<p>invasion a spirit of greater force and audacity was
</p>
<p>needed. The eyes of the people fell upon Obietto
</p>
<p>Fieschi, who was at Rome a prisoner of Sixtus IV., the
</p>
<p>ally of Sforza. He eluded the Pope's vigilance, put
</p>
<p>himself at the head of his own vassals, and fought
</p>
<p>long, until, defeated by the imperial forces under
</p>
<p>Prospero Adorno, he was forced to take shelter in the
</p>
<p>castles of his county. The fortresses of Pontremoli,
</p>
<p>Varese, Torriglia, Savignone, and Montobbio were
</p>
<p>one after the other wrested from him, and he himself
</p>
<p>was captured and conducted to Milan, where, becoming
</p>
<p>involved in a plot against the Duchess Bona, he was
</p>
<p>detained in prison. His brother, Gianluigi, took his
</p>
<p>place and kept alive the fire of liberty. He routed
</p>
<p>Giovanni del Conte and Giovanni Pallavicini, in
</p>
<p>Rapallo, with terrible slaughter. He afterwards
</p>
<p>entered into negociations, and ceded Torriglia and
</p>
<p>Roccatagliata to Prospero Adorno.
</p>
<p>But the Sforza government had so outraged the
</p>
<p>Genoese that popular indignation ran high against it,
</p>
<p>and Prospero Adorno resolved to free himself from his
</p>
<p>unfortunate alliance, and, to strengthen his new
</p>
<p>position, sought and obtained the aid of the counts
</p>
<p>of Lavagna. The Lombard regency sent a splendidly
</p>
<p>equipped army of more than sixteen thousand men, to
</p>
<p>compel the rebels to return to their allegiance ; but

<p>Gianluigi Fieschi assaulted them in flank and rear with

<p>roiTt. The enemy took refuge in Savignone and
</p>
<p>Montobbio, but Fieschi refused to listen to terms of
</p>
<p>accommodation, stormed those stronghokls, recovered
</p>
<p>his feuds, and retained the prisoners as a ransom for
</p>
<p>Obietto.
</p>
<p>The Fieschi may have been restless partisans and
</p>
<p>promoters of intestine strife, but they were never
</p>
<p>tyrants. Their broad lands, from which they drew
</p>
<p>large revenues and considerable armies, enal^led them
</p>
<p>to make war upon a republic akeady strong in arms,
</p>
<p>and to snatch victory from the troops of foreign lords.
</p>
<p>At this period they held in the duchies of Parma and
</p>
<p>Piacenza the feuds of Calestano, Vigolone, Pontremoli,
</p>
<p>Valdettaro, Terzogno, Albere, Tizzano, Balone, and a
</p>
<p>number of smaller castles ; in the territory of Lunigiana
</p>
<p> Massa, Carrara, Suvero, Calice, Vepulli, Madrignano,
</p>
<p>Groppoli, Godano, Caranza, and Brugnato ; in Valdi-
</p>
<p>bubera they were masters of Varzi, Grimiasco, Torriglia,
</p>
<p>Cantalupo, Pietra, and Savignone ; in Piedmont 
</p>
<p>Vercelli, Masserano, and Crevacore ; in Lombardy

</p>
<p>1303), and Castiglione di Lodi ; in Umbria  Mugnano ;
</p>
<p>in the kingdom of Naples  San Valentino ; in Liguria,
</p>
<p>to say nothing of Lavagna, where they coined money
</p>
<p>before 1294,* they possessed more than a hundred
</p>
<p>boroughs.

<p>imperial gift before Innocent and Hadrian ascended to
</p>
<p>the Pontifical throne. Nicolb Fieschi alone, to pass by-
</p>
<p>others of the family, bought seventy castles in Lunigiana
</p>
<p>from the bishop of Limi and from the lords of Carpena
</p>
<p>then very powerful. He ceded a gi-eat part of these
</p>
<p>feuds to the Repubhc, when he took the leadership of
</p>
<p>the Guelphs and formed alliance with Naples against
</p>
<p>the libertines (1270). This was the origin of long and
</p>
<p>bitter contests which finally ended in a treaty of peace
</p>
<p>and the absolution of Genoa from the interdict hurled
</p>
<p>against her by Pope Gregory at the instance of Cardinal
</p>
<p>Fieschi, whose lands the Eepublic had seized. The
</p>
<p>convention provided for the cession of a great part of
</p>
<p>the Cardinal's feuds to Genoa (1276). We believe there
</p>
<p>is no other family which counts in its registers two
</p>
<p>Popes, seventy-two Cardinals and three-hundred Arch-
</p>
<p>bishops, Bishops and Patriarchs. Siniblado who assumed
</p>
<p>the tiara in 1242 under the title of Innocent IV, was an
</p>
<p>illustrious Pontiff. Frederick II, who had found in
</p>
<p>him when cardinal a warm ally, proved the strength
</p>
<p>of his hostility when he became Pope. The Emperor
</p>
<p>shut up the Pope in the castle of Sutriin 1244 and the
</p>
<p>Genoese sent twenty two galleys to raise the siege and
</p>
<p>rescue the pontiff. Innocent accompanied his deli-
</p>
<p>verers to Genoa and from here travelled by the mountain
</p>
<p>road of Varazze to the castle of Stella, of which Jacopo
</p>
<p>Grillo (an accomplished troubadour) was lord, and

<p>remained there for forty days. A fountain from which

<p>and excommunciated Frederick, his son Corrado and
</p>
<p>his followers and partisans the Duke of Bavaria and
</p>
<p>Ezzelino.
</p>
<p>The Emperor to avenge this affront, captured and
</p>
<p>destroyed the castles of the Fieschi in Liguria. The
</p>
<p>Pope, to rebuild and secure a home wasted by many in-
</p>
<p>vasions, formed the magnificent scheme of surrounding
</p>
<p>Genoa with walls and converting it into a refuge for
</p>
<p>the Guelph party. He selected for his own residence the
</p>
<p>convent of S. Domenico,* which had been the church
</p>
<p>of St. Egidius (having been donated to that patriarch
</p>
<p>in 1220.) The Ghibellines, learning the Pope's design,
</p>
<p>raised a tumult and prevented the erection on that site
</p>
<p>of the palace which afterwards adorned the summit of
</p>
<p>Carignano.
</p>
<p>Ottobuono, son of Tedisio, followed Innocent in the
</p>
<p>papal dignity and took the name of Hadrian V. As
</p>
<p>legate of Urban IV, he had conducted with success
</p>
<p>some difficult political negotiations. In the Council of
</p>
<p>Lyons and in his embassies to Germany and Spain, the
</p>
<p>superiority of his mind had given him a foremost place.
</p>
<p>When he ascended the pontifical tlirone, he curbed the

<p>insolence of Charles of Anjou who was abusing his
</p>
<p>office as Senator of Rome. His reign was short, for as

</p>
<p>The great Poet condemns him to the circle of the
</p>
<p>avaricious in Pm-gatory, perhaps on account of the vast
</p>
<p>wealth which he amassed while cardinal, the rental of
</p>
<p>which exceeded a hundred thousand gold marks.
</p>
<p>Luca Fieschi, Cardinal of S. Maria Invialata, was still
</p>
<p>richer. He, like all the rest of his family, wielded the
</p>
<p>sword as well as made pastoral addresses. The famous
</p>
<p>Sciarra Colonna, captured by him at Anagni, had bitter
</p>
<p>experience of his warlike spirit. This cardinal as legate
</p>
<p>of Clement V in Italy, accompanied Henry VH in his
</p>
<p>expedition to our Peninsula in 1311. It was through
</p>
<p>his influence that Brescia and Piacenza were saved
</p>
<p>from pillage as a punishment for their revolt. After
</p>
<p>Henry's coronation in Pome, the cardinal obtained by
</p>
<p>a decree, issued at Pisa in 1313, the fuU confirmation
</p>
<p>of all his ancient feudal rights. In his will, he ordered
</p>
<p>that, whoever of his heirs should be patron of the
</p>
<p>church of S. Adriano in Trigoso should build, on the
</p>
<p>estates of Benedetta De Marini, a church of equal size
</p>
<p>and beauty with that in Trigoso, and he bequeathed a
</p>
<p>large amount of property to be spent in its construction.
</p>
<p>This is the origin of that Gothic church in Vialata
</p>
<p>whose sides are covered with alternate slabs of black
</p>
<p>and white marbles. The word Vialata is not derived
</p>
<p>from the violets which once blossomed over that height,
</p>
<p>as some tell us, but from the cardinalate of that temple
</p>
<p>which the vandals of our time have not yet entii*ely
</p>
<p>disfigured. The friends of Luca Fieschi erected an
</p>
<p>honourable monument to him, in the duomo of Genoa,

<p>Giovanni Ficsclii, bishop of Vercelli and Guelph
</p>
<p>leader was also a military chieftain. In 1371, he
</p>
<p>marched upon Genoa at the head of eight hundred
</p>
<p>horse to avenge his family who as rebels had been dis-
</p>
<p>possessed of the castle of Roccatagliata by the Republic.
</p>
<p>He waged a long war with the Visconti. They had
</p>
<p>robbed him of Vercelli, but he reacquired this feud by
</p>
<p>subsequent treaty. He obtained from the Pope the
</p>
<p>temporal severeignty of that city ; and Boniface IX
</p>
<p>and his successors invested him with Montecapelli,
</p>
<p>Masserano and Crevacore. After his death, Vercelli
</p>
<p>passed into the hands of his nephew Gianello, of good
</p>
<p>fame both as a cardinal and warrior. It was by his
</p>
<p>influence and that of Giacomo Fieschi, Archbishop of
</p>
<p>Genoa, that the Republic undertook to rescue Urban
</p>
<p>IX when he was besieged in Nocera di Puglia. Nor
</p>
<p>were Guglielmo and Alberto Fieschi without military
</p>
<p>celebrity. They conquered the kingdom of Naples for
</p>
<p>their uncle Innocent IV. Not less warlike were Eman-
</p>
<p>uele and Giovanni Fieschi, who as bishops and lords
</p>
<p>governed Biella in the middle of the fourteenth century.
</p>
<p>Giovanni, however, had the misfortune to incur the
</p>
<p>displeasure of his people, was driven from power, and
</p>
<p>ended his days in prison, 1377. The civil life of
</p>
<p>Genoa for many centuries was a succession of political
</p>
<p>revolutions. The leading spirits were always the
</p>
<p>Fieschi and Grimaldi, Guelphs, and the Spinola and
</p>
<p>Doria, partisans of the Empire. Carlo Fieschi was
</p>
<p>certainly a turbulent spirit and a promoter of discord.

<p>handed the Republic over to Robert of Naples, and

</p>
<p>Francesco Fieschi attempted to give Genoa to his son-
</p>
<p>in-law the marquis of Monferrato. Francesco had
</p>
<p>fought as Guelph general against Opizzino Spinola
</p>
<p>and the marquis of Monferrato had given him valuable
</p>
<p>aid in the campaign which he successfully closed by
</p>
<p>burning Busalla and desolating the Spinola estates.
</p>
<p>But Francesco exercised the rights acquired by con-
</p>
<p>quest with a moderation unusual in those times ; and he
</p>
<p>committed the government of the city to sixteen
</p>
<p>citizens.
</p>
<p>For the rest, the Fieschi though sometimes turbulent
</p>
<p>and dangerous to the peace of the city, never laid vio-
</p>
<p>lent hands on the liberties of the Eepublic. Their
</p>
<p>struggles aimed to emancipate the city from the influ-
</p>
<p>ence and control of the imperial party, and they always
</p>
<p>faithfully served those to whom they ofi'ered their
</p>
<p>arms.
</p>
<p>It is fitting to enumerate among the heroes of this
</p>
<p>noble line a Giacomo Fieschi whom St. Louis created
</p>
<p>a grand marshal of France as a reward for many dis-
</p>
<p>tinguished services. Innocent IV. invested this Giacomo
</p>
<p>with the kingdom of Naples and it is probable that
</p>
<p>Charles V alluded to this fact when, wiiting to Sini-
</p>
<p>baldo Fieschi, he declared him descended from the loins
</p>
<p>of kings. Nor can we omit Giovanni Fieschi who, in
</p>
<p>1337 governed the province of Milan and fell bravely in
</p>
<p>battle ; nor Danielo and Luca Fieschi who served as
</p>
<p>Florentine generals. It was this Luca who in 1406
</p>
<p>conquered Pisa.

<p>women have been distinguished for purity of life and
</p>
<p>force of character, a few, unfortunately, for vicious
</p>
<p>practices. We pass by Alassina, wife of Moruello
</p>
<p>Malaspina whom Dante, after having lived in her court,
</p>
<p>praised for her virtues. We know little else of her
</p>
<p>career. We pass Vu-ginia, daughter of Ettore Fieschi
</p>
<p>and wife of the Prince of Piombino, a wise and virtuous
</p>
<p>matron ; and also Jacopina who after the death of her
</p>
<p>first husband, Nino Scoto, married Obizzo da Este.
</p>
<p>Alconata, or according to others Gianetta Fieschi,
</p>
<p>daughter of Carlo and wife of Pietro de Kossi, lord
</p>
<p>of Parma, was notorious for lascivious manners,
</p>
<p>and a still more infamous celebrity attaches to
</p>
<p>the name of Isabella Fieschi, wife of Lucchino
</p>
<p>Visconti. The Milanese Chroniclers tell us that Fosca
</p>
<p>(an epithet given to Isabella) obtained permission from
</p>
<p>her husband to attend the naval tournament held in
</p>
<p>Venice at the feast of the ascension in 1347. Magnifi-
</p>
<p>cent preparations were made in Lodi for the journey
</p>
<p>of the duchess. She selected for her cortege the flower
</p>
<p>of the Lombard knights and ladies. It is said that
</p>
<p>every dame was accompanied by her admirer. Isabella
</p>
<p>was received at Mantua with distinguished courtesy by
</p>
<p>Ugolino Gonzaga whom she made happy by her em-
</p>
<p>braces. On her arrival in Venice she abandoned herself
</p>
<p>to the arms of Doge Dandolo and the most elegant and
</p>
<p>accomplished gentleman of that republican court. The
</p>
<p>dames of her cortege, as usually happens, followed the
</p>
<p>example and imitated the gallantries of their mistress.

<p>Genoese dame, on learning the intention of her out-

<p>The daughter of Giacomo Fieschi and Francesca di

<p>Catherine whom the church has glorified as a saint.
</p>
<p>She was beautiful in person, simple in her tastes and
</p>
<p>pure in her life. From her earliest years she avowed
</p>
<p>her desire to take the veil ; but, constrained by her
</p>
<p>parents, she married Giuliano Adorno, a man addicted
</p>
<p>to every species and degree of vice. The virtues and
</p>
<p>prayers of Catherine, whose pure spirit above all earthly
</p>
<p>aims looked stedfastly towards heavenly things, were
</p>
<p>powerful enough to draw him back to the paths of
</p>
<p>virtue.
</p>
<p>She was a miracle of love and wisdom. She wrote
</p>
<p>learned works, especially a treatise upon Purgatory,
</p>
<p>which received the encomiums of Cardinal Bellarmino,
</p>
<p>of the doctors of the Sorbonne and of the first philoso-
</p>
<p>phers and critics of that period (1510.)

</p>
<p>was she less charming in person nor less gifted in
</p>
<p>literary talents ; but her manuscripts are unfortunately
</p>
<p>lost and time has destroyed aU but the sweet perfume
</p>
<p>of her virtues.
</p>
<p>In the beginning of the thirteenth century, the
</p>
<p>counts of Fieschi separated into two branches, that of
</p>
<p>Savignone of which we do not purpose to write, and
</p>
<p>that of Torriglia. Both however continued to call
</p>
<p>themselves counts of Lavagna, in memory of their
</p>
<p>origin.
</p>
<p>At this early period they were followers of the im-
</p>
<p>perial party and they received from Frederic, as his
</p>
<p>feudatories, the armorial bearing of three azure bars on a
</p>
<p>silver field. But when Frederic quarrelled with the Holy
</p>
<p>See the Counts embraced the Papal side and became
</p>
<p>leaders of the Guelph party. Then they placed the cat
</p>
<p>(gatto) over their crests in honour of the Bavarian
</p>
<p>family, head of the Guelph faction in Germany,
</p>
<p>which probably gave us the name. Later, they wrote
</p>
<p>under the cat "sedens ago" a symbol, says Federigo, of
</p>
<p>that wisdom which produces by force of intellect rather
</p>
<p>than of hand.* The Torriglia branch used sometimes
</p>
<p>to place a dragon upon their helmets ; but the cat, as
</p>
<p>more ancient, was the true armorial bearing of the
</p>
<p>family.

<p>cini and Rossi took their spouses from the Fieschi
</p>
<p>family, and received feuds, estates, and burghs as
</p>
<p>dowries. The most illustrious families of Italy coveted
</p>
<p>alliance with their blood. Even the counts of Savoy
</p>
<p>intermarried with them and in this way acquired large
</p>
<p>possessions in Piedemont. Innocent IV. married his
</p>
<p>niece Beatrice to count Tomaso of Savoy, and gave
</p>
<p>as dower the castles of Rivoli and Viana, together with
</p>
<p>the valley of Sesia, In 1259 count Tomaso was
</p>
<p>created by Innocent gonfaloniere of the church ; and
</p>
<p>Ottobuono Fieschi liberated from prison in Asti
</p>
<p>Amedeo, Tomaso and Ludovico, sons of Tomaso.
</p>
<p>They were not less generous and distinguished at
</p>
<p>home. About the year 1286, they erected a large
</p>
<p>tower and a castle at the gate of Sant' Andrea. In
</p>
<p>times equally remote, Opizzo Fieschi built for his resi-
</p>
<p>dence a marble palace on the piazza of the duomo,
</p>
<p>enriching it with statutes, decorations, and precious
</p>
<p>vessels. This palace served afterwards for the council
</p>
<p>chamber of the Podesta, until Boccanegra took posses-
</p>
<p>sion of it. Innocent IV. was born there. They built
</p>
<p>several other palaces in the city, which enjoyed full
</p>
<p>immunity ; neither the sheriff nor his officers could
</p>
<p>cross their threshholds to serve writs or capture those
</p>
<p>who had taken refuge within them. The greater part
</p>
<p>of their palaces were destroyed in the rage of civil war.
</p>
<p>The one which Carlo Fieschi fortified near the church
</p>
<p>of S. Donato was ruined in 1393, and a year later that
</p>
<p>of cardinal Griacomo Fieschi, one of the most sumptu-
</p>
<p>ous in Ital y, shared the sme fate.

<p>They did not content themselves with adorning
</p>
<p>Genoa with palaces. The convents of Servi, S. Leo-
</p>
<p>nardo, and S. Francesco bear witness to their public
</p>
<p>spirit, not to mention the many hospitals, churches,
</p>
<p>and other 'public edifices with which they enriched the
</p>
<p>Eastern Riviera. These public charities were at various
</p>
<p>times rewarded with dignities and privileges, especially
</p>
<p>by a decree that the first-born of the count of Lavagna
</p>
<p>should sit in the council chamber above the elders and
</p>
<p>next to the Doge. The ofiice of doge, denied by law
</p>
<p>to the nobles until 1528, the Fieschi, in the height of
</p>
<p>their power, conferred upon their adherents, and in
</p>
<p>peaceful times they were by this means masters of the
</p>
<p>Republic. There is no instance in which a Fieschi, in
</p>
<p>any revolution, attempted to grasp at supreme power,
</p>
<p>or lay violent hands on popular liberty.
</p>
<p>Gianluigi II. was no exception to this rule. He
</p>
<p>purchased from Corrado Doria the feud of Loano, and
</p>
<p>was ambitious of becoming master of Pisa. When the
</p>
<p>Pisans asked as a favour to be incorporated into the
</p>
<p>Republic of Genoa, Gianluigi, as a means to his private
</p>
<p>ambition, discouraged his fellow-citizens from accepting
</p>
<p>the gift. The Genoese were so enraged at discovering
</p>
<p>the motives and intrigues of Fieschi, that a year after
</p>
<p>they excluded the nobles from office, took possession of
</p>
<p>the Fieschi castles, and elected eight tribunes of the
</p>
<p>people as heads of the government. Louis XIL, insti-
</p>
<p>gated by the nobility, punished this plebeian audacity
</p>
<p>by restoring the Fieschi to their ancient dominions,

<p>Liguria. At that time the king visited Genoa, and
</p>
<p>lodged in the Fieschi palace in Carignano, where, per-
</p>
<p>haps in the festal rejoicings, he encountered that
</p>
<p>Tomasina Spinola, who, according to the chronicles of
</p>
<p>the period, was so smitten with his personal charms,
</p>
<p>that she died soon after of her unhappy love.
</p>
<p>The riches and power of Gianluigi gave him the title
</p>
<p>of Great, and his virtues and varied abilities acquu*ed
</p>
<p>him such consideration that, when after the death of
</p>
<p>his first wife, Bartolomea della Eovere, he wedded
</p>
<p>Catherine, sister of the Marquis of Finale, the senate
</p>
<p>paid homage to his distinguished merit by proclaiming
</p>
<p>a safe conduct from Corvo to Monaco for aU who should
</p>
<p>attend the espousals. His son, Sinibaldo, did not, like
</p>
<p>his father, cultivate the friendship of the French. His
</p>
<p>brother was assassinated by the Fregosi, and to obtain
</p>
<p>vengeance he used his influence to elevate the Adorni
</p>
<p>to the place occupied by the Fregosi, When Ottaviano
</p>
<p>Fregoso returned to power, Sinibaldo retired to his
</p>
<p>estates, formed an alliance with the Adorni, and
</p>
<p>marched upon Genoa in 1522. He fought bravely
</p>
<p>against the French when Cesare Fregoso led them
</p>
<p>against the city, but he was made prisoner, and only
</p>
<p>obtained his liberty by the payment of a heavy ransom.
</p>
<p>Afterwards he united with Andrea Doria to expel the
</p>
<p>French from Genoa ; he captured Savona by storm, and
</p>
<p>gave powerful aid to Andrea in carrying the Republic
</p>
<p>over to the Imperial cause. Having lost his brothers,

<p>Charles V. confirmed liis titles to his estates. He went
</p>
<p>as the ambassador of the Republic, to assume the in-
</p>
<p>vestiture from the emperor of some castles, and spent
</p>
<p>on the occasion a large sum which he would not permit
</p>
<p>the Republic to repay.
</p>
<p>Sinibaldo united to his feuds Pontremoli, for which
</p>
<p>he paid twelve thousand gold crowns'^ to Francesco
</p>
<p>Sforza. His united possessions now embraced thirty-
</p>
<p>three walled castles, besides innumerable estates and
</p>
<p>villas on the sides of the Appennines, bounded by
</p>
<p>Genoa and Sarzana on the sea, and by Tortona, Bobbio,
</p>
<p>Parma and Piacenza, inland.
</p>
<p>He was also master of many other feuds separated
</p>
<p>from his county. He drew such large revenues from
</p>
<p>these lands that the Republic had no other citizen of
</p>
<p>equal wealth, and he lived with a pomp and luxury till
</p>
<p>then unknown in Italy. His munificent generosity
</p>
<p>earned him the merited praise of Axiosto, who places
</p>
<p>him at the fountain of Malagigi,  foremost among
</p>
<p>those whose lances are wounding the fierce image of
</p>
<p>avarice.

<p>He died in 1532, leaving Maria della Rovere a
</p>
<p>widow. She was the niece of Julius H., and bore Sini-

<p>attribute to him the impulse that revived lil)eral studies.
</p>
<p>The great intellects who flourished under his pontificate
</p>
<p>had risen to fame before his time. He covered them
</p>
<p>with wealth and honours out of no sympathy with their
</p>
<p>pursuits, but to emasculate their independent spirits
</p>
<p>and stifle the groans of the nation in whose bosom the
</p>
<p>spirit of independence began to react under the hammer
</p>
<p>of incessant misfortune.
</p>
<p>The manners of Leo were wholly corrupt and his
</p>
<p>religion atheism. The Lutheran doctrines which spread
</p>
<p>in his time owed their success to the trade in indul-
</p>
<p>gences, the profits of which he conferred before collec-
</p>
<p>tion upon his sister Magdalene Cybo, to repay her
</p>
<p>family for the princely receptions they gave him in

<p>Genoa.
</p>
<p>The scribblers called him The Great, because they
</p>
<p>lived upon him, and were only idle ornaments of a
</p>
<p>luxurious court. He entertained the Romans with
</p>
<p>feasts and games, because he was a devotee of pleasure,
</p>
<p>and, according to the saying of the people, wished to

<p>enjoy the papacy. But the chases of Corneto and
</p>
<p>\''iterbo, the infamies of Malliana, the suppers of the

<p>money borrowed at forty per cent. The people of the

</p>
<p>At the death of Maximilian of Austria, the electors
</p>
<p>conferred the empire on Charles V. of Spain, who was
</p>
<p>already master of the Two Sicilies. The power of
</p>
<p>Charles threatened the independence of Rome, and Leo
</p>
<p>formed a league with France, in the audacious hope of
</p>
<p>expelling the Spaniard from Italy. But he betrayed
</p>
<p>his ally for a dukedom in the kingdom, conferred on
</p>
<p>his bastard son Alexander de' Medici. A war broke out,
</p>
<p>and the Papal and Imperial troops, led by Prospero
</p>
<p>Colonna and Marquis Pescara, had already occupied
</p>
<p>Milan, when the sudden death of Leo cut short his en-
</p>
<p>terprises. His successor was the Flemish Van Trusen,
</p>
<p>under the title of Hadrian VL He had never set foot
</p>
<p>in Italy, and was therefore called a barbarian. The
</p>
<p>corrupt prelates despised a Pope, under whom absolu-

<p>Hadrian was unable to continue the war, the Papal

<p>Besides the Rovere, Baglioni and Malatesta had seized

</p>
<p>the Marquis of Monferrato and the Duke of Savoy were

</p>
<p>was barbarized and taxed to the verge of ruin by those
</p>
<p>Spanish hordes who from the poverty of their clothing
</p>
<p>were called the Bisogni.'^ Charles did not pay his
</p>
<p>armies a sous, and they had scarcely routed the French
</p>
<p>under Lautrec when they began a general pillage of
</p>
<p>Italy. Though the Pope was Charles' ally the pontificial
</p>
<p>territory did not escape the common fate. The excesses
</p>
<p>of Ultramontane lust and avarice bred a terrible pesti-
</p>
<p>lence in Florence and in Eome ; new wounds for Italy.
</p>
<p>Wlien the plague had reached its height, the pontiff in
</p>
<p>an insane fright abolished the sanitary laws on the plea

<p>that they were offensive to Heaven and heretical.
</p>
<p>Thus the pestilence, encountering no obstacles, raged
</p>
<p>with unchecked violence.
</p>
<p>We are told that in these straits, the Eomans longing

<p>league of the enemies of Spain, the mustering of armies

<p>and the liberation of the illustrious prisoner. The Pope

</p>
<p>emperor whose satellites he paid largely for leaving
</p>
<p>him in peace. The German leaders divided the money
</p>
<p>and went on robbing the subjects of the Pope.
</p>
<p>In the meantime the treaty of Madrid (1526) released
</p>
<p>Francis I. from prison and he made haste to violate the
</p>
<p>stipulations extorted from him by force. He formed

<p>an alliance for the liberation of Italy, with the Pope,

<p>Pietro Bembo who had been secretary to Leo X., Ludo-
</p>
<p>vico Canossa, the French ambassador in Venice, and
</p>
<p>Jacopo Sodoleto, an extraordinary genius whom the
</p>
<p>amorous overtures of the beautiful Imperia failed to
</p>
<p>degrade. Sodoleto, a man deeply religious and patriotic
</p>
<p>had urged Clement to make bold reforms in the bosom
</p>
<p>of the church. He founded in Eome, with the cope-
</p>
<p>ration of Ghiberti, Bembo, CarafFa and many others, the
</p>
<p>oratorio of divine love, and he openly professed his belief
</p>
<p>in the doctrine of justification by faith, a dogma of the
</p>
<p>evangelical churches.
</p>
<p>Around these leaders, the lovers of liberal studies and
</p>
<p>of their country, began to form a party, which included
</p>
<p>such men as Valeriano Pierio, Vida, Bini, Blasio, Negri,
</p>
<p>Navagero and even Berni, who, when he saw that Pope
</p>
<p>Clement neglected the advice of patriots and clung to
</p>
<p>Spain, prophesied that the Pope and his shearers would
</p>
<p>share the ruin of Italy. This awaking to liberty and
</p>
<p>the increasing aversion of the Italians to the Imperial
</p>
<p>power, stimulated the Spanish governors to harsher
</p>
<p>measures. The desertion of their party by the duke of
</p>
<p>Milan furnished the conquerors with a specious pretext
</p>
<p>for desolating whole provinces and draining the blood
</p>
<p>of the people by taxation and subsidies. This unfortu-
</p>
<p>nate country saw at that moment a spectacle of un-
</p>
<p>bridled barbarity without parallel in history. The
</p>
<p>Spanish soldiers were quartered in the houses of the
</p>
<p>Milanese, and the citizen was treated not as a host but
</p>
<p>as a prisoner. His feet were tied to a bed, or to a

<p>28 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGI FIESCHL
</p>
<p>be tormental into surrendering money or lands ; or to
</p>
<p>the gratification of a more vile cupidity. When the
</p>
<p>unfortunate victim died of grief or, impelled by rage
</p>
<p>and despair, drowned himself in a well or tlirew himself
</p>
<p>from a window, the Bisogni immediately sought
</p>
<p>another house in which to renew the same barbarities.
</p>
<p>The Lombard provinces had not even the consolation
</p>
<p>of human pity. The duke of Urbino, commanding the
</p>
<p>armies of Venice and Rome, gave them no encourage-
</p>
<p>ment to hope. Indeed, he lacked the means for open
</p>
<p>war or even for skirmishing with the Spanish army.
</p>
<p>Germany poured down new soldiers. Shall we say
</p>
<p>soldiers ? George Frandesperg marched at the head of
</p>
<p>fifteen thousand robbers, and swore to put a halter
</p>
<p>round the neck of the Pope and to pay his legions with
</p>
<p>the pillage of Italian cities.
</p>
<p>Nor were foreigners the only tormentors of the
</p>
<p>bleeding peninsula. In Rome the Orsini supported the
</p>
<p>Pope the Colonna were partisans of Csesar. Cardinal
</p>
<p>Pompeo collected eight thousand peasants on the Agro
</p>
<p>Ronumo and unleashed them against the Vatican.,
</p>
<p>They made a general pillage and their leader compelled
</p>
<p>the Sultan of Christianity , as he styled the Pope, to
</p>
<p>break the league he had formed with Venice and
</p>
<p>France. Deeds were committed which history shrinks
</p>
<p>from recording. The Ultramontanes, not content with
</p>
<p>enslaving provinces, slaked their thirst in the blood of
</p>
<p>the people. The inhumanity of the Germans, the
</p>
<p>avarice of the Swiss  who even then made merchandise

</p>
<p>THE ITALIAN STATES IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY. 29
</p>
<p>licentiousness of the Gauls reached and polluted every-
</p>
<p>thing in Italy.
</p>
<p>It is true that there was this diversity in their
</p>
<p>manners, that the Swiss and Germans, despising the
</p>
<p>restraints of both law and religion, utterly despoiled
</p>
<p>the vanquished and revelled in every species of bru-
</p>
<p>tality ; while the French divided the spoils with those
</p>
<p>to whom they belonged and seduced, instead of violating,
</p>
<p>the women. As for the Spaniards, words are inade-
</p>
<p>quate to describe the cruelty with which they
</p>
<p>slaughtered and tore in pieces our conquered popula-
</p>
<p>tions. Macchiavello has finely contrasted the French
</p>
<p>and the Spaniards of that time. " The Frenchman is
</p>
<p>equally prodigal of his own property and that of his
</p>
<p>neighbour and he robs with small concern whether he
</p>
<p>is to eat the booty, destroy it or make riot of it with
</p>
<p>the lawful owner. The spirit of the Spanish plunderer
</p>
<p>is different ; when he robs you do not hope to see a shred
</p>
<p>of your own again." Spanish despotism imprinted its
</p>
<p>bloody hands on the face of every province. Witness
</p>
<p>the pillage of Rome by the Constable of Bourbon  who
</p>
<p>perished there, perhaps by the hand of Cellini  ^for
</p>
<p>proof that the Goth Alaric and every other barbarian
</p>
<p>leader were less ferocious than a christian army. The
</p>
<p>Spanish hordes plundered all the wealth and precious
</p>
<p>vessels which the devotion of Christendom had amassed
</p>
<p>in the churches of Rome during twelve centuries. The
</p>
<p>Spanish catholics were worse vandals than the German
</p>
<p>Lutherans. Whoever escaped the clutches of the one

<p>himself by paying heavy ransom. In Rome the most
</p>
<p>venerable things were put to unseemly uses. Drunken
</p>
<p>soldiers in sacred robes and mitres danced obscene
</p>
<p>dances in the streets and public squares, and their
</p>
<p>impious mockeries always ended in bloody saturnalia.
</p>
<p>The corpses of murdered citizens strewed the streets ;
</p>
<p>and after nine months of this carnival of death, a fierce
</p>
<p>pestilence broke out to complete the desolation.
</p>
<p>The emperor derived no advantage from imprisoning
</p>
<p>the Pope, wasting his provinces and butchering his
</p>
<p>people. A pressing want of money induced Charles to
</p>
<p>restore Julius to his throne, as the same motive had led
</p>
<p>him to liberate the French king. It seems incredible
</p>
<p>that the master of Spain, the Netherlands, Sicily, the
</p>
<p>Lombard pro\dnces and Mexico should have dra^vn no
</p>
<p>profit from his vast possessions. The Lutheran move-
</p>
<p>ment in Germany, the threats of France, the distrust
</p>
<p>of the king of England, the secret intrigues of the Pope
</p>
<p>and the doubtful fidelity of some Italian princes,
</p>
<p>whom Venice was inciting to revolt, may have con-
</p>
<p>spired to palsy his arms in the very moment of victory.
</p>
<p>A little before the sack of Rome, Odo di Foix, lord
</p>
<p>of Lautrec and general of France avenged the defeat of
</p>
<p>his sovereign at Pavia by capturing this city and sub-
</p>
<p>jecting it to an eight day's pillage. The edifices w^ere
</p>
<p>so ruined and the population so thinned that Leandro
</p>
<p>Albert! writes ;  " The sight of it excited compassion."

</p>

<p>ravage, very few returned to their native lands. The
</p>
<p>THE ITALIAN STATES IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY. 31
</p>
<p>Peninsula became their sepulchre  of the French par-
</p>
<p>ticularly  who to speak truth, seldom committed those
</p>
<p>excesses which were common to the Spaniards and
</p>
<p>Germans. It may be added, too, that it has always
</p>
<p>been the misfortune of France to make useless conquests
</p>
<p>in Italy. Her army which, after the destruction of
</p>
<p>Melfi, advanced to the siege of Naples, counting more
</p>
<p>than twenty-five thousand men, was so thinned by
</p>
<p>pestilential fevers that two months afterwards it did
</p>
<p>not contain four thousand men fit for duty. The
</p>
<p>frightful plague did not spare Lautrec, and after the
</p>
<p>treaty of Antwerp only a few skeletons were permitted
</p>
<p>to set foot on the soil of France. The army which
</p>
<p>deluged Rome with blood met with a more calamitous
</p>
<p>fate. Shut up in Naples under the Prince of Orange,
</p>
<p>governor of that city, it was attacked and mowed down
</p>
<p>by a pestilence which was at once the consequence and
</p>
<p>punishment of its insane license. Even Francis Bour-
</p>
<p>bon, count of San Polo, who, the Bisogtii having left
</p>
<p>nothing to plunder, put the villages and hamlets through
</p>
<p>which he passed to fire and sword, was totally defeated
</p>
<p>and made prisoner in Landriano (1529) by the ferocious
</p>
<p>Antonio di Leyva, the scourge of Lombardy.
</p>
<p>The kings becoming weary, the people being drained
</p>
<p>of their blood, the necessity of peace was strongly felt.
</p>
<p>Charles V., who had no title to greatness, but the extent
</p>
<p>of his dominions, who was crooked in design and
</p>
<p>avaricious of spirit, hastened to form an incestuous

<p>union with the Pope, and the fruit of their embraces

</p>
<p>children for the shameful desertion. He ignominiously
</p>
<p>lost in this treaty the honour which he preserved
</p>
<p>stainless in his defeat and capture at Pavia. This king-
</p>
<p>had strange contradictions in his character. He pro-
</p>
<p>mised, with apparent sincerity, liberty to nations and
</p>
<p>then abandoned them at caprice ; he was hated by
</p>
<p>people whom he overwhelmed with public burdens,
</p>
<p>but loved by the learned whom he protected and
</p>
<p>honoured. He offered his hand to the heretics of
</p>
<p>Germany, and burned under a slow fire the heretics of
</p>
<p>France. He invited the Turks into Italy and betrayed
</p>
<p>the Venitians and Florentines ; but he kept faith with

<p>king, now vainly defended by the brave Ferruccio was
</p>
<p>forced to humble herself to slavery. That portion of
</p>
<p>North Italy which in modern language is called Pied-
</p>
<p>mont was involved in equal if not greater disasters.
</p>
<p>On account of its situation between Austria and France,
</p>
<p>it was overrun and desolated by barbarian invaders
</p>
<p>from 1494 to 1559. " We do not believe," say the
</p>
<p>commissioners of Henry VIII. of England, " that it is
</p>
<p>possible to find in all Christendom greater wretchedness
</p>
<p>than reigns in this country. The best towns are either
</p>
<p>in ruins or depopulated. There are few districts in
</p>
<p>which food is to be found. The extensive plain, fifty
</p>
<p>miles in length, which lies between Vercelli and Pavia,
</p>
<p>once so fertile in cereals and wines, is reduced to a
</p>
<p>desert. The fields are uncultivated ; except three poor
</p>
<p>women gathering a few grapes, we saw not the shadow
</p>
<p>of a human creature. There, they neither sow nor
</p>
<p>reap ; the country sides are growing wild, and the un-
</p>
<p>cultivated vines are returning to their primitive state."
</p>
<p>Charles III., the unfortunate, was ruling over these
</p>
<p>desolated provinces and his subjects suffered every
</p>
<p>species of indignity, outrage and despotism. To render
</p>
<p>matters, if possible, a little worse, Gonzaga urged the
</p>
<p>Emperor to reduce to a swamp all that wide plain
</p>
<p>between the Alps and the Po to form a barrier to
</p>
<p>French invasion of Lombardy.
</p>

<p>Nice, where in 1538 Paul III. held the congress at which
</p>
<p>a truce was concluded between Csesar and Francis I.
</p>
<p>Five years afterwards, Francis marched upon and
</p>
<p>beseiged it with the help of the Turks. This siege is
</p>
<p>memorable in Italian history for the heroic spirit of
</p>
<p>Segurana, ])ut after the death at the sword's point of
</p>
<p>all her bravest defenders, the city was forced to sur-
</p>
<p>render. The citizens abandoned their homes, though
</p>
<p>they had obtained a promise of immunity for their
</p>
<p>property from pillage by the soldiery. The Turks kept
</p>
<p>faith, while the French violated their pledges, thus
</p>
<p>giving rise to a general desire among Italians to become
</p>
<p>subject to the Turks, from a conviction that they could
</p>
<p>no longer endure the weight of their misfortunes.
</p>
<p>There were writers as Vives, who speaking of Italy,
</p>
<p>(1529) sought to discourage this sentiment, telling the
</p>
<p>Italians that the Turks would heap worse miseries
</p>
<p>upon them. But it is incredible that Soliman could
</p>
<p>have equalled the endless tortures inflicted by Francis

</p>
<p>their fellows ; they continue to fight and will fight to

<p>the end of their lives."* He proceeds :  " Afflicted
</p>
<p>peoples cannot do better than pray God to destroy or
</p>
<p>subject them both to the sway of the grand Tin^k, so
</p>
<p>that the world may come under the power of a single
</p>
<p>monarch, who, though he be a barbarian and an enemy
</p>
<p>to our laws, may give us a, little repose wherein to rear
</p>
<p>our children to a life, of poverty indeed, but free from
</p>
<p>the burdens of our miserable existence."
</p>
<p>The people of Germany, always restless under the
</p>
<p>yoke of ancient Kome, were rising against the Papal
</p>
<p>power, which had taken the place of the ancient empire.
</p>
<p>At the voice of Luther laying bare the festering
</p>
<p>diseases of the Roman court, the learned of Italy were
</p>
<p>moved. The Pope comprehended that there was no
</p>
<p>other means of extirpating the seeds of reform which-
</p>
<p>had already sprung up in Italy but to ally himself with
</p>
<p>catholic Spain : she was in the zenith of her glory.
</p>
<p>Such captains as Cortes and Pizzaro sailed away with
</p>
<p>a galley and returned conquerors of a new world. Wlio
</p>
<p>better than the compatriots of Torquemada could
</p>
<p>suffocate in blood the free voices of the disciples of
</p>
<p>Huss and Wicliffe ? From that moment the compact of
</p>
<p>Charlemagne was renewed between Charles V. and

<p>the Roman theocracy, and through it the Spaniards
</p>
<p>tightened their grasp on Milan, Naples, Palermo and

<p>From Charles V. dates our humiliation and slavery.
</p>
<p>From his time the Peninsula has had no proper history.
</p>
<p>Its vicissitudes and calamities are only episodes of the
</p>
<p>great drama enacted by the nations who have fought
</p>
<p>against each other for our blood. The council of Trent
</p>
<p>was not an act of national life. It grew out of the
</p>
<p>philosophic spirit of reform and the scandals of the
</p>
<p>Roman court, and was initiated by Germany and
</p>
<p>France while England was separating herself from the
</p>
<p>catholic church. This celebrated synod shows nothing
</p>
<p>but the conflict between the church and the empire,
</p>
<p>between the reformers and the courtiers of Rome
</p>
<p>struggling to maintain their privileges, between the
</p>
<p>Popes who fought to maintain their al^uses and the
</p>
<p>secular princes who secretly laboured to shake off" the
</p>
<p>priestly yoke. The Italian people had no part in it.
</p>
<p>The religious discussions upon divine grace, predestina-
</p>
<p>tion and justification by faith did not reach us, who
</p>
<p>were everywhere plotting to recover our independence
</p>
<p>and freedom.
</p>
<p>In fact this is the century of popular conspiracies,
</p>
<p>which were always strangled by degenerate noljles and
</p>
<p>foreim armies. It is true that the most illustrious
</p>
<p>Italians sided with the people and died for their
</p>
<p>righteous cause ; but these were vain struggles. From
</p>
<p>the day that Lorenzino de'Medici, for whom the

<p>dating in Italy) was too bitter, formed the design of

</p>
<p>of liberty took fire and in every city the plebeians rose
</p>
<p>against their foreign oppressors.
</p>
<p>Such, briefly, was the condition of Italy in the early
</p>
<p>part of the sixteenth century, in which she lost that
</p>
<p>preeminence and reputation under which she had
</p>
<p>hitherto flourished. It is necessary to study this
</p>
<p>period, because it was then that Europe initiated the
</p>
<p>great work of her civil renovation, while in Italy there
</p>
<p>was desperate strife between dying liberties and rising
</p>
<p>tyrannies. Two hostile forces were wi'estling together
</p>
<p>and shaking men s souls ; the regal and foreign domi-
</p>
<p>nion supported by the nobles, and the generous pride
</p>
<p>of citizens making heroic sacrifices to remain a people.
</p>
<p>Charles V. turned the trembling balance. Only in that
</p>
<p>age could have risen the company of Jesus, who did
</p>
<p>not, like the monks, constitute a democracy but an
</p>
<p>absolute monarchy such as Caesar was founding on the

<p>ruins of our communes. The disciples of Loyola and

</p>
<p>We turn with painful recollections from the conditions
</p>
<p>of Italy to that of the Geonese Kepublic. Our annals
</p>
<p>offer us only vicissitudes of intestine divisions and
</p>
<p>wars, in which, however, there were heroic achieve-
</p>
<p>ments that have rendered the Republic illustrious.
</p>
<p>The history of Liguria is full of the Doria name.
</p>
<p>There is no modern family which can boast so many
</p>
<p>examples of heroism as this house, and only the Scipios
</p>
<p>among the ancients are entitled to equal fame. From
</p>
<p>the earliest times they were partisans of the empire ;
</p>
<p>while the Fieschi, after Innocent IV. maintained the
</p>
<p>cause of the people, drawing to that side the powerful
</p>
<p>family of Grimaldi. The Doria and Spinola formed
</p>
<p>alliance, and became the leaders of the Ghibellines.
</p>
<p>From that moment a warm contest arose between these
</p>
<p>great families, and it did not end until, in 12.57, the

<p>people elected Guglielmo Boccanegra captain and
</p>
<p>ANDREA DORIA AND THE REPUBLIC OP GENOA. 39
</p>
<p>defender of their liberties. After his death, the hostile
</p>
<p>nobles renewed their insane discords ; but the people,
</p>
<p>weary of these domestic wars and following the exam-
</p>
<p>ples of other Italian communes, drove out the nobles,
</p>
<p>(1340) and created Simon Boccanegra first Doge. The
</p>
<p>nobles were by law excluded from this highest office,
</p>
<p>and even from the command of a galley ; ^ and not a
</p>
<p>few illustrious fixmilies passed into the ranks of the
</p>
<p>people by their own election. It is well knowTi that
</p>
<p>before the reforms of Doria, the so-called nobles were
</p>
<p>held in less honour than distinguished men of the
</p>
<p>people, because their rank excluded them from the
</p>
<p>Dogate and many other offices. The Doria and Spinola
</p>
<p>came to power in a revolutionary period, and in viola-
</p>
<p>tion of law. This severe prohibition was afterwards
</p>
<p>modified, but the office of Doge continued to be a
</p>
<p>popular prerogative. The principal families of the
</p>
<p>people were the Adorni and Fregosi, in whose hands
</p>
<p>the supreme offices remained for several centuries, and
</p>
<p>these names are conspicuous in our civil conflicts which
</p>
<p>were so frequent and bitter that in one year the head
</p>
<p>of the government was four times changed. In these
</p>
<p>calamitous times  redeemed from disgrace by the three
</p>
<p>manly figures of Columbus, Julius II., and Andrea
</p>
<p>Doria,  the Geonese, whose misfortune has ever been
</p>
<p>to despise servitude and to be incapable of preserving
</p>
<p>liberty, were compelled to invoke the protection of
</p>
<p>j^rinces strong enough to curb the ambition of indivi-
</p>
<p>dual citizens. But it was always stipulated that the

<p>40 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGI FIESCHI.
</p>
<p>franchises of the city should not be impaired, nor its
</p>
<p>laws changed ; there was, in fact, no true transfer of
</p>
<p>power. Whenever we were borne down by foreign
</p>
<p>arms, it was the work of the nobility conspiring against
</p>
<p>the people.
</p>
<p>Even in the time of Louis XII., when Italy was
</p>
<p>yielding him a tardy and reluctant obedience, the
</p>
<p>Geonese rose in rebellion, triumphed over the plots of
</p>
<p>the nobles, threw down the government of the royal
</p>
<p>vicar, drove out the army of Cleves, assembled in the
</p>
<p>Church of St. Maria di Castello, and elected eight
</p>
<p>tribunes of the people. The nobles were put to flight,
</p>
<p>the hostile army routed, and supreme power returned
</p>
<p>to the hands of the people.
</p>
<p>The Geonese showed themselves truly great. They
</p>
<p>drew out of his workshop Paolo da Novi, a silk dyer,
</p>
<p>and despite his modest refusals elected him Doge. Nor
</p>
<p>did they err in electing the modest operative to the
</p>
<p>highest office. " Paolo," as Foglietta writes, "was a man
</p>
<p>of honour and integrity, pure fi'om every vice, and
</p>
<p>proof against all the temptations of the great." His
</p>
<p>first and sole study was the glory and unity of the
</p>
<p>Eepublic. He, in fact, reconquered some feuds for the
</p>
<p>state, particularly Monaco, which the Grimaldi had
</p>
<p>usurped.
</p>
<p>In the midst of Paolo's generous designs, Louis XII.,
</p>
<p>to whom the Geonese nobility had opened the doors of
</p>
<p>their country, descended upon him with a formidable
</p>
<p>army. Genoa was converted into a field of battle ;

<p>every plebeian became a soldier, and the valour of the
</p>
<p>ANDREA DORIA AND THE REPUBLIC OF GENOA. 41
</p>
<p>citizens checked the impetuous advance of the French
</p>
<p>batalions. But the patriots were overcome by numbers
</p>
<p>and discipline; Paolo di Novi was betrayed and
</p>
<p>butchered ; the people were reduced to slavery. Ro-
</p>
<p>dolfo di Lanoia, to whom Louis committed the govern-
</p>
<p>ment of the city, was constrained to resign his office, 
</p>
<p>says Foglietta  on account of the boundless avarice and
</p>
<p>insolence of the nobles who struggled to advance their
</p>
<p>private interests by ruining the public weal.
</p>
<p>As Boccanegra was the father of our popular liberty
</p>
<p>so Doria was its executioner. He wrested the govern-
</p>
<p>ment from the hands of the people, and committed it
</p>
<p>to those of the nobles. He momentarily silenced, but
</p>
<p>did not destroy, the rage of parties. By depressing
</p>
<p>the populace, he cut the nerves of the Republic; he
</p>
<p>gave us independence in name, but he destroyed the
</p>
<p>franchises of the citizens. A great historian has justly
</p>
<p>said, that the liberties given us by Andrea Doria are
</p>
<p>ridiculous ; the future will accept that as the final
</p>
<p>decision of history.
</p>
<p>Andrea was a soldier from his youth. He learned
</p>
<p>the rudiments of war from Domenico Doria, who was
</p>
<p>of his blood and had distinguished himself in the court
</p>
<p>of Innocent VHI. He served successfully under the
</p>
<p>Pope, Ferdinando the old of Naples and his son Al-
</p>
<p>fonso n., and sustained the siege of Rocca Guglelma
</p>
<p>agjainst Gonsalvo di Cordova. Afterwards he fouQfht

<p>Borgia, by taking him to Venice and entrusting him to
</p>
<p>the protection of the Venitian senate.
</p>
<p>He allied himself with the party of the Fregosi, who
</p>
<p>were friends of his house ; and when Doge Ottaviano
</p>
<p>besieged for twenty-two months the fortress of Cape
</p>
<p>Faro, which was held for the French ; he fought single-
</p>
<p>handed with the brave Emanuel Cavallo, and was
</p>
<p>slightly wounded in the contest.
</p>
<p>But his greatest glory was acquired in naval war.
</p>
<p>His battles with the Moors and Turks gave him fame
</p>
<p>and wealth, and after the battle of Pianosa (1.519), in
</p>
<p>which, with six vessels, he conquered thirteen of the
</p>
<p>enemy's ; capturing several with the famous corsair
</p>
<p>Gad Ali' he became the terror of Saracen ships. When
</p>
<p>the Fregosi were driven from power and their places
</p>
<p>taken by the Adorni, Doria, disdaining to serve under
</p>
<p>this family, sold his services to France, and took with
</p>
<p>him. six galleys belonging to the Eopublic, which he
</p>
<p>never restored. The motive of this appropriation of
</p>
<p>public property was his bitter animosity to Spain,
</p>
<p>whose party the Adorni and the Eepublie had em-
</p>
<p>braced. This animosity was rendered more violent by
</p>
<p>the sack of Genoa in 1.522 by the Spanish army, a
</p>
<p>pillage so horrible that when the authors of it, Pescara,
</p>
<p>Colonna and Sforza, presented themselves to Pope
</p>
<p>Hadrian humbly asking pardon, the pontiff indignantly
</p>
<p>repulsed them, crying,  " I cannot, I ought not, I will
</p>
<p>not forgive you."

</p>
<p>and the galleys, without hope of redemption, all
</p>
<p>Spaniards who fell into his hands.
</p>
<p>In the year 1527, Pope Clement VIII. was allied
</p>
<p>with his most Christian Majesty, with the Venitians
</p>
<p>the Florentines and other governments against the
</p>
<p>power of Charles. To further the objects of the alliance
</p>
<p>Francis sent Lautrec into Italy at the head of forty
</p>
<p>thousand men, and Andrea Doria besieged Genoa with
</p>
<p>a large force. It is not within our scope to describe
</p>
<p>how the Republic, through the influence of Csesar
</p>
<p>Fregosi and Doria, went over to the party of France.
</p>
<p>Francis, to gratify the wishes of Andrea, entrusted the
</p>
<p>government to Teodoro Trivulzio, Antoniotto Adorno,
</p>
<p>having gracefully retired from the office of Doge.
</p>
<p>Doria having been created admiral of France, with a
</p>
<p>salary of thirty-six thousand crowns, rose to great fame,
</p>
<p>on account of his victories and those of his lieutenants.
</p>
<p>Among these victories, that of Filippino Doria in the
</p>
<p>gulf of Salerno, deserves a brief mention, both because
</p>
<p>it was won by Italian arms, and because something
</p>
<p>should be added to the accounts given by other authors.
</p>
<p>Lautrec, while besieging Naples, desired to blockade
</p>
<p>the port, so as to prevent the supply of provisions to
</p>
<p>its defenders, and sent for the galleys of Doria, seven
</p>
<p>of which were then in Leghorn, under the command of
</p>
<p>Filippino Doria Count of Sassocorbario and Canosa
</p>
<p>mid Andrea's cousin.

<p>unable to sustain the siege, and the viceroy, Hugo
</p>
<p>44 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGI FIESCHL
</p>
<p>Moncada, saw the necessity of breaking the enclosing
</p>
<p>lines by some daring undertaking. He collected six
</p>
<p>galleys called the Capitana and Gobha, (the property
</p>
<p>of Fabrizio Giustiniano) one belonging to Sicames,
</p>
<p>another which was the property of Don Bernardo
</p>
<p>Vallamarino, the Perpugnana and Calahrese. To
</p>
<p>these were added ten brigantines and some smaller
</p>
<p>vessels. The viceroy embarked upon the ships twelve
</p>
<p>hundred Spaniards clad in mail and commanded by the
</p>
<p>flower of the officers and barons of the kingdom.
</p>
<p>Finally, he himself joined the expedition and gave the
</p>
<p>command of the artillery to Gerolamo da Trani and
</p>
<p>that of the army to Fabrizio Giustiniano, called the
</p>
<p>hunchback, a brave Genoese in the pay of Spain. The
</p>
<p>latter, knowing the courage and skill of the Ligurian
</p>
<p>mariners advised that the Spanish fleet should avoid a
</p>
<p>close engagement with Doria ; but a contrary opinion
</p>
<p>prevailed.
</p>
<p>Count Filippino was in the waters of Salerno when
</p>
<p>the report reached him that the imperial fleet had left
</p>
<p>Naples.
</p>
<p>He asked Lautrec to reinforce him with only two
</p>
<p>hundred infantry. Of the eight vessels under his com-
</p>
<p>mand, that is, the Capitana, Pellegrina, Donzella,
</p>
<p>Sirena, Fortwia, Mora, Padrona and Signora, he sent
</p>
<p>the three last under the command of Nicol5 Lomellino
</p>
<p>out to sea as if they wished to escape, mth orders,
</p>
<p>however, to turn about, and, driving down before the
</p>
<p>wind, attack the enemy in the rear. Filippino with

<p>cada, who, trusting to the strength of his fleet and the
</p>
<p>bravery of his captains, confidently looked for a signal
</p>
<p>victory. The galley of the viceroy closed with the
</p>
<p>Capitana, the flag-ship of Doria, who, firing his basilisk,
</p>
<p>small cannon and falconets, raked the Spanish vessel
</p>
<p>from prow to poop with such fatal accuracy that forty
</p>
<p>armed men were killed, among whom were the bravest
</p>
<p>barons of the kingdom, Leo Tassino, a nobleman of
</p>
<p>Ferrara, Luigi Cosmano a famous musician, Don Pietro
</p>
<p>di Cardona and many others The batteries of Moncada
</p>
<p>replied but did little damage to the Genoese. The
</p>
<p>Gohha, the galley of Sicames and that of Don Bernardo
</p>
<p>were more fortunate. They closed with the Pellegrina
</p>
<p>and the Donzella and the Spanish soldiers bt)arded
</p>
<p>without difficulty. The Perpugyiana and the Cala-
</p>
<p>brese cannonaded the Sirena until she was forced to
</p>
<p>surrender. Doria had now lost three galleys, the
</p>
<p>Capitana and the Fortuna were in imminent danger
</p>
<p>of being boarded, not being able to sustain the attacks
</p>
<p>of six galleys and fifteen smaller vessels whose grappling
</p>
<p>irons were seizing them on every side. Everything
</p>
<p>looked propitious for Moncada and victory seemed
</p>
<p>secure to him, when the three galleys which Doria
</p>
<p>had sent to sea turned their prows and bore down
</p>
<p>swiftly before the wind. At close quarters, they poured
</p>
<p>in a terrible fire which dismasted the Spanish vessels
</p>
<p>and strewed their decks with the dead. The viceroy

</p>
<p>falconet and he fell among his men mowed down under
</p>
<p>the fire-balls and showers of stones poured in by the
</p>
<p>Genoese. Having captured the flagship of the viceroy,
</p>
<p>Lomellino assailed the Gohba. Here more than a
</p>
<p>hundred arquebusiers were killed, Caesar Fieramosca
</p>
<p>lost his life and Giustiniano was wounded and lost his
</p>
<p>galley. Filippino Doria now released from their chains
</p>
<p>the convicts and the Turkish slaves with a promise of
</p>
<p>liberty and sent them to recover the Donzella, which
</p>
<p>they soon accomplished. They attacked the Pellegrina
</p>
<p>and the Sirena with such fury that the Perpugnana and
</p>
<p>Calabrese, seeing further defence useless, turned their
</p>
<p>prow^and sailed away seaward. The brigantines were
</p>
<p>reduced to helpless wrecks and the remainder of the
</p>
<p>Spanish vessels found it impossible to continue the
</p>
<p>conflict. The marquis of Vasto and Ascanio Fiera-
</p>
<p>mosca, after having displayed a most admirable
</p>
<p>courage, seeing their galleys reduced to a sinking
</p>
<p>condition, Gerolamo da Trani killed, their captains

<p>wounded, their soldiers shattered and pounded by stones

<p>and half consumed by fire, gracefully surrendered to

<p>Nicol5 Lomellino who was already at close quarters
</p>
<p>with the Mora. Sicames and Don Bernardo Vallama-

</p>
<p>sunk. All the lancers were killed, but their leader
</p>
<p>Corradino escaped with the galley Perpugnana.

<p>The killed amounted to more than a thousand and

<p>the prisoners were much more numerous. Among the

</p>
<p>Vasto, Ascanio Fieramosca, the PrincG of Salerno, the
</p>
<p>marquis Santa Croce, Falmzio Giustiniano, and other
</p>
<p>illustrious barons and famous warriors.
</p>
<p>This action was fought on the 28th of April, 1528.
</p>
<p>It was not long after this signal victory so fatal to the
</p>
<p>imperial power and counted so honourable to the name
</p>
<p>of Doria  though it was fought by his lieutenant
</p>
<p>Filippino  that Andrea changed sides and enlisted under
</p>
<p>the very power he had conquered.
</p>
<p>History has not yet given a satisfactory account of
</p>
<p>the motives which led Doria, hitherto a violent enemy
</p>
<p>of Csesar, to desert the standard of France and offer his
</p>
<p>sword to Spain. It was a desertion fruitful of num-
</p>
<p>berless misfortunes as we shall show in the progress of
</p>
<p>this work. It is certain that this change contributed
</p>
<p>more largely than anything else to alter the fortunes
</p>
<p>of Italy, and to reduce her to slavery under the empire.
</p>
<p>It induced both peoples and princes to submit to the
</p>
<p>Spanish power, Luigi Alamanni, seduced by the influ-
</p>
<p>ence of Andrea, adopted that policy, though he was
</p>
<p>one of the warmest friends of liberty, and he attempted
</p>
<p>to persuade the Florentines to ally themselves with
</p>
<p>Csesar. The unfortunate patriot suflered for his
</p>
<p>delusion. The people hearing the rumour that he
</p>
<p>advocated such opinions compelled him to seek personal
</p>
<p>safety in exile from Florence.
</p>
<p>Eetm-ning to the question, we mention first the
</p>
<p>reasons put forward by the historians for the justifica-
</p>
<p>tion of Doria. They tell us that France had not paid

<p>away from him the prince of Orange whom Doria had

<p>captured, thus defrauding the Admiral of the twenty
</p>
<p>thousand ducats of ransom ; that the kinsj sou2;ht to
</p>
<p>get possession of the marquises Vasto and Colonna
</p>
<p>with a like motive ; that this monarch granted favours
</p>
<p>m prejudice of Genoese rights to rebellious Savona ;
</p>
<p>and that a rumour ran of the king's having given this
</p>
<p>city in feud to Montmorency.
</p>
<p>However, Doria was blamed (according to the testi-
</p>
<p>mony of Varchi,) by the greater part of the Italians,
</p>
<p>and many accused him of desertion and treason. They
</p>
<p>said that his conduct was not dictated by his resent-
</p>
<p>ment at the liberty of Savona, or the slavery of Genoa,
</p>
<p>which he himself enslaved, but rather by his boundless
</p>
<p>appetite for wealth and honours. Some affirm that
</p>
<p>Giovanni Battista Lasagna, whom Doria had sent to
</p>
<p>Paris to treat for the recovery of Savona, informed him
</p>
<p>that the king's council had determined to deprive him,
</p>
<p>not only of his prisoners, but also of his own life, and
</p>
<p>that this information led him to enlist under Csesar.
</p>
<p>Others, on the contrary, say that the king of France
</p>
<p>having heard that Doria intended to abandon his ser-
</p>
<p>vice, sent to him Pierfrancesco di Noceto, Count of
</p>
<p>Pontremoli and his esquire, to dissuade him from that
</p>
<p>design and to promise payment of the ransom of
</p>
<p>Orange and other prisoners as well as the Admiral's
</p>
<p>personal salary. It is difficult to arrive at the truth
</p>
<p>when testimony is so confficting. One fact only is
</p>
<p>unquestioned : that before the last day of the month of

<p>While these events were passing, there were secret

<p>amidst the horrors of a pestilence which was mowing-

</p>
<p>It is painful to see this brave Admiral selling his
</p>
<p>sword now to the Pope, now to Naples, now to France,
</p>
<p>and finally to Spain ! It is painful to see him be-
</p>
<p>coming the ally of foreign oppressors who sought to
</p>
<p>su1)due our peoples and engulf Italy. History must
</p>
<p>pronounce him -more fortunate than great. In truth,
</p>
<p>most of his undertakmgs were singularly successful ;
</p>
<p>]3ut his attempts to capture the famous corsair Chisr,
</p>
<p>better kno^^m under the name of Barbarossa, who was
</p>
<p>governing Algiers for Selim with the title of Begherheg,
</p>
<p>were not crowned with success. Indeed, a rumom' ran
</p>
<p>that between these two lords of the main there was a
</p>
<p>secret contract that they should never meet in pitched
</p>
<p>battles. It is certain that Doria conducted his war
</p>
<p>upon his rival with much coldness and rather as a
</p>
<p>neutral than as an enemy. He permitted the pirate to
</p>
<p>escape at Prevesa (1539), when he had the power to
</p>
<p>destroy his fleet.
</p>
<p>This failure of Doria left the fierce corsair to spread
</p>
<p>the terror of his name for many years along the Italian
</p>
<p>coasts, particularly in the kingdom of Naples, where
</p>
<p>he had abeady carried desolation and ruin, devoting to

</p>
<p>poor page suffered most, for she caused him to be
</p>
<p>stabbed because' he had that night either seen or dared
</p>
<p>too much.
</p>
<p>Doria is also accused of having used every means to
</p>
<p>excite the Turks against Venice ; and this Republic,
</p>
<p>through his plotting, was assailed in her Greek pos-
</p>
<p>sessions. Doria, by refusing to uiute his forces to those
</p>
<p>of the Pope and the Venitians, incurred the respon-
</p>
<p>sibility for the capture of seven thousand Christians at
</p>
<p>the siege of Corfu, the pillage of the Ionian Islands
</p>
<p>and of Dalmatia, Having become a blind devotee of
</p>
<p>Spain, whose rule in the Peninsula he wished to
</p>
<p>strengthen, he refused to fight at Prevesa, because the
</p>
<p>Venitians had declined to receive his Bisogni on board
</p>
<p>their galleys ; or, which amounts to the same thing, in
</p>
<p>order to let a flood of Turks overwhelm Venice and
</p>
<p>render her submissive to the yoke of Spain. All parties
</p>
<p>accused him of having promoted the ruin of Christians
</p>
<p>by the very means to which they looked for salvation.
</p>
<p>As to the history of his policy in Genoa, if it were
</p>
<p>our office to wiite the life of Andrea, there is much
</p>
<p>that deserves to be rendered more clear. It was not
</p>
<p>a sagacious policy to subject the Republic to Spain at
</p>
<p>a time when the seeds of civil concord were springing
</p>
<p>up. It was more foolish to permit a foreign ruler to
</p>
<p>carry on her government, and despite the entreaties of
</p>
<p>his relatives to permit Savona to be torn from the body
</p>
<p>of the Republic

<p>Nor should it be forgotten that soon after this, he, to
</p>
<p>52 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGI FIESOHI.
</p>
<p>promote his own ends, wished to make Genoa a partner
</p>
<p>in his alienation from France, though his family
</p>
<p>favoured the unions promoted by the aimahle Trivulzio
</p>
<p>and the King of France. Truth requires us, also, to
</p>
<p>assert that he did not enter the service of Spain with
</p>
<p>the praiseworthy object of recovering Savona for Genoa.
</p>
<p>He drove out the French from Genoa in September,
</p>
<p>1528, but Savona had been from the first of July re-
</p>
<p>conciled and restored to the Kepublic, a fact which is
</p>
<p>proved by a decree of Francis I. soon to be printed .^^'
</p>
<p>When Guicciardini wrote that, " among the motives
</p>
<p>attributed to Doria for his change of masters, it was
</p>
<p>believed that the most probable and the principal one
</p>
<p>was, not offended pride for having been too highly
</p>
<p>esteemed or any other personal discontent, but the
</p>
<p>desire to advance his o"wti greatness under the name of
</p>
<p>national liberty," we think the verdict creditable to the
</p>
<p>first of our Italian historians.
</p>
<p>But these accusations cannot deprive Doria of the
</p>
<p>merit of having refrained from assuming the absolute
</p>
<p>sovereignty of his country ; though we know that the
</p>
<p>love of liberty in his fellow citizens must have been,
</p>
<p>sooner or later, fatal to such an ambition. In such an
</p>
<p>open assault upon popular liberty, he would have found
</p>
<p>enemies in his own house, as he did, in fact, when he
</p>
<p>enlisted in the service of Spain. This is proved by the

</p>
<p>and is a conspicuous proof of the profound antipathy
</p>
<p>of Ligiu-ia to Spain. Doria, knowing well the liberal
</p>
<p>tendencies of his fellow citizens, contrived to get
</p>
<p>princely authority and power without assuming the
</p>
<p>name.
</p>
<p>The laws of the union shaped by him changed the
</p>
<p>face of the Republic. His chief reform consisted in
</p>
<p>removing the middle classes from the public offices by
</p>
<p>adding new families to the nobility. The gentlemen
</p>
<p>resented the elevation of plebeians to their side ; the
</p>
<p>lower classes complained ; for though the law left them
</p>
<p>free to ascribe themselves to the nobility, it was soon
</p>
<p>seen that this law was a new deception. The constitu-
</p>
<p>tion of Doria was fashioned with aristocratic aims, and
</p>
<p>if it established equality, it was only among the nobles.
</p>
<p>The people had neither guaranty nor representation.
</p>
<p>Leo writes that however wisely the instrument was
</p>
<p>framed, it failed to establish the rights of the plebeians.
</p>
<p>This class had no more share in the state than the
</p>
<p>peasantry of the Riviera, and remained, with its pre-
</p>
<p>carious and humble title of citizenship, subject to the
</p>
<p>nobility.
</p>
<p>The law which changed a family into a collection of
</p>
<p>persons, or Alhetyo, was more than unjust, it was
</p>
<p>iniquitous. Those who entered these Alherghi were
</p>
<p>forced to renounce their own names, however honom*-
</p>
<p>able they might be, to extinguish their own memory
</p>
<p>and that of their ancestors, in order to assume the name
</p>
<p>of the congregation ; so that for example, a Biagio

<p>Asereto would be compelled to take the name of a

</p>
<p>Vivaldi for no otlier reason than that the hitter name
</p>
<p>was borne by more persons. Many truly illustrious
</p>
<p>and most honourable houses preferred to remain in the
</p>
<p>number of the people ; and it is related that of two
</p>
<p>brothers Castelli ; one made himself a noble under the
</p>
<p>title of Grimaldi, while the otlier remained a man of the
</p>
<p>people under his christian name Giustiniano.
</p>
<p>It can no longer be denied that the laws of 1528
</p>
<p>destroyed the government by the people and created
</p>
<p>that by the nobility. The book of gold was opened
</p>
<p>every year to eight plebeians of the city and of the
</p>
<p>Riviera ; but this was not enough to silence the just
</p>
<p>complaints of that portion of the people, who until
</p>
<p>these reforms had always taken part in public affairs.
</p>
<p>In 1531, to satisfy the common grievance, forty-seven
</p>
<p>families, who before had been left forgotten among the
</p>
<p>lower class, were enrolled among the nobles ; the expe-
</p>
<p>dient did not at all tend to remove the defects of the
</p>
<p>constitution. These admissions into the class who held
</p>
<p>power were controlled by the caprices of a single person
</p>
<p>or at best only a few. Every year eight senators were
</p>
<p>appointed to select the eight families for promotion,
</p>
<p>and in practice each senator selected one from his
</p>
<p>friends among the people. The gravest abuses grew
</p>
<p>out of this, and the book of gold was often opened to
</p>
<p>the most vulgar and degraded plebeians.
</p>
<p>Neither moral nor intellectual qualifications, nor
</p>
<p>even distinguished services rendered to the country,
</p>
<p>could break down the barrier to the patriciate ; but

<p>the inscribing of a name often served for the

</p>
<p>dowers of Senator's daughters  nay, it was even
</p>
<p>sold.
</p>
<p>The new nobles, in order to increase their numbers
</p>
<p>and to retain the friendship of the people, inscribed
</p>
<p>their relatives and friends, however despicable might
</p>
<p>be their social condition. There was even a greater
</p>
<p>abuse. The chancellors, who kept the book of gold,
</p>
<p>inscribed names at their pleasure. In 1560 the names
</p>
<p>of three families were ordered to be erased, having been
</p>
<p>entered Avithout authority.
</p>
<p>These abuses were never fully abolished until the
</p>
<p>reforms of 1576 Avhich entkely excluded the people
</p>
<p>from the public offices.
</p>
<p>We have seen that the reforms of Doria, practically
</p>
<p>placed the government in the hands of the nubles.
</p>
<p>The newly inscribed were few in number ; and things
</p>
<p>were so arranged that the old patricians always had
</p>
<p>the control in the administration. This created a new
</p>
<p>element of discord in the hatred which sprung up be-
</p>
<p>tween the old and the new nobles. A profound
</p>
<p>rancour diffused its virus through the body politic, and
</p>
<p>clanships grew strong and fought hard against each
</p>
<p>other. Nothing was wanting but names ; and names
</p>
<p>are sometimes a great power, by which to designate the
</p>
<p>opposing factions. The names were found, and the old
</p>
<p>nobles were called the Portico of San Luca, and the
</p>
<p>ncAV, Portico of San Pietro. Both epithets were de-
</p>
<p>rived from the places where the hostile factions were
</p>
<p>accustomed to assemble.

<p>by weight of numbers in the public conucils, resolved
</p>
<p>to attempt secret ways to their end. They managed
</p>
<p>so well that in 1545 they secured the election to the
</p>
<p>Dogate of Giovanni Battista de Fornari/''" The faction
</p>
<p>of San Luca raised a, great outcry of indignation, but
</p>
<p>in vain. De Fornari, a new noble, stepped over their
</p>
<p>heads into the highest office. They remembered the
</p>
<p>humiliation, and afterwards avenged themselves upon
</p>
<p>the new Doge.
</p>
<p>From what we have said it will be seen that the
</p>
<p>laws of Andrea, far from restoring the Republic, sowed
</p>
<p>new seeds of discontent between the nobles, so con-
</p>
<p>cordant in their discord, and the people over whom

<p>Doria, Admiral of Csesar, conqueror by the arms of

<p>than twenty galleys, concentrated all power in the

<p>hands of the old nobility, whom he made blindly de-

<p>voted to his interests. It is no marvel that he directed

<p>at pleasure the ship of the Repubbc. Without the

<p>name, he possessed the supremacy and honours of a
</p>
<p>prince. Men called him the Father of his country and
</p>
<p>the Restorer of liberty. What we have said shows the
</p>
<p>nature of the liberties which he gave the State, and they
</p>
<p>will be further illustrated in the progress of this his-

<p>tumultuous liberty. He loved his country ; but obey-
</p>
<p>ing the orders which he received weekly from Caesar,
</p>
<p>he enslaved that country to Spain. On the contrary,
</p>
<p>the Republic had always better consulted her interests
</p>
<p>by standing in a neutral attitude between contending
</p>
<p>princes.
</p>
<p>Ottaviano Sauli gave eminent proof of such political
</p>
<p>wisdom when the Republic sent him as its envoy to
</p>
<p>the Duke of Milan, and he brought back and enforced
</p>
<p>by his advice the counsel of that prince, to keep neutral
</p>
<p>and resist the influence of Caesar in Genoa. The
</p>
<p>government preferred this policy, and in its letters to
</p>
<p>the English king, to Venice and to Florence, openly
</p>
<p>avowed that its chief care was to live in freedom ;
</p>
<p>that it knew the advantages of neutrality, and would
</p>
<p>not bow to the will of others ; that its single aim was
</p>
<p>to strengthen and maintain its integrity and its policy
</p>
<p>of supporting the independence of the other Italian
</p>
<p>Republics.*
</p>
<p>These were generous words, and they were supported
</p>
<p>by deeds. But Doria willed the supremacy of Spain,
</p>
<p>and he triumphed. Then Genoa, in the siege of Flor-
</p>
<p>ence, favoured the enemies of Italy ; even threw a lance
</p>
<p>at Siena ; extinguished in blood the revolt of Naples,
</p>
<p>and, with the arm of Doria, strangled everywhere the
</p>
<p>voice of national liberty.
</p>
<p>From that moment the robust vigour of the Re-

<p>public began to decrease, and the shadows of old age

<p>took the place of our civil strifes and our heroic achieve-
</p>
<p>ments abroad.
</p>
<p>Doria, though naturally disposed to temperate and
</p>
<p>modest habits of life, gradually developed the pomp and
</p>
<p>state of a prince. He lived in Fassolo, in the houses
</p>
<p>once given to Pietro Fregoso for his brave deeds in
</p>
<p>Cyprus (1373). Doria called from every part of Italy
</p>
<p>the most famous architects to embellish this palace.
</p>
<p>The sculptures of Montorsoli and of Giovanni and
</p>
<p>Silvio Corsini da Fiesole, the paintings of Pierin del
</p>
<p>Vaga, Pordenone, Gerolamo da Trevigi, Giulio Romano
</p>
<p>and Beccafumi rendered this residence famous through-
</p>
<p>out Italy. Here he was surrounded by his own sol-
</p>
<p>diers, and received, writes Mascardi,* not as a simple
</p>
<p>citizen, but as a proud grandee. The same author
</p>
<p>ascribes to this luxury of life the origin of the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy of Fieschi ; and he approves ostracism by re-
</p>
<p>publics of citizens who affect the manners of princes.
</p>
<p>These mimicries of royalty gave general dissatisfac-
</p>
<p>tion ; but the selection of Gianettiuo di Tommaso as
</p>
<p>his adopted son and his successor in the dignity of
</p>
<p>Admkal, was even more unpopular.
</p>
<p>We find notices of this young man which represent
</p>
<p>him to have once, on account of the slender means of
</p>
<p>his father, kept a shop for the sale of oil. Afterwards
</p>
<p>he entered the service of Bernardo Invrea, a silk-
</p>
<p>weaver, and remained with him until, being pursued

</p>
<p>he was allied Ijy Ijlood.
</p>
<p>Taking up from necessity the profession of arms,
</p>
<p>Gianettino soon acquired a considerable name for war-
</p>
<p>like feats marked by enterprise and audacity. He
</p>
<p>possessed an intrepidity rather singular than rare; He
</p>
<p>soon became haughty and despotic putting on airs fitter
</p>
<p>for a Castilian than a Genoese, and decorating himself
</p>
<p>with a coat of arms as though supreme authority were
</p>
<p>already in his hands. The prince, instead of correcting
</p>
<p>these excesses, permitted the arrogant youth to lord it
</p>
<p>over the plebeians and to indulge his wild caprices at
</p>
<p>pleasure.
</p>
<p>Count Filippino Doria, as we have seen, contributed
</p>
<p>to the fame of Doria. He was of humble fortune until
</p>
<p>the Duke of Urbino, as a mark of gratitude for having
</p>
<p>perilled his life to succour the duke in a single combat,
</p>
<p>conferred upon him an estate of the Urbino family.
</p>
<p>Some other members of Doria's house, who had been
</p>
<p>schooled under him, gave good proof of their skill and
</p>
<p>acquired riches and honours which reflected lustre on
</p>
<p>their master. Such were Francesco Doria di Giovanni ;
</p>
<p>Antonio Doria, marquis of Santo Stefano, Aveto and
</p>
<p>Ginnosa, and one of the principal generals at the victory
</p>
<p>of San Quintino ; Giovanni Battista Doria, son of

<p>Antonio and heir of his valour ; Giorgio Doria, and

<p>manded, in addition to the triremes of the empire, not
</p>
<p>less than twenty taride or large galleys of his own,
</p>
<p>manned by his own officers and crews and paid by the
</p>
<p>emperor at the rate of five hundred broad ducats of
</p>
<p>gold per month for each vessel. He took with him,
</p>
<p>also, the ships of the Republic, arid those of his relations
</p>
<p>and of other citizens who chartered their 'panfili, or
</p>
<p>vessels of sixty oars, to the emperor of Spain. At the
</p>
<p>assault of Prevesa the prince commanded, not to speak
</p>
<p>of square-sailed galleons and caracks, twenty-two tri-
</p>

<p>of that period."'' Antonio Doria, who was only less
</p>
<p>illustrious in naval warfare than Andrea  though, as
</p>
<p>Badaero wrote in his report to the Venitian senate, he
</p>
<p>was so fond of traffic that, when his ships passed from
</p>
<p>one port to another, they carried so much merchandise

<p>Francesco Costa, not to speak of many others. The
</p>
<p>Fieschi also sent a vessel, and the Eepublic furnished
</p>
<p>twelve.
</p>
<p>In fact there was no distinguished family which did
</p>
<p>not arm a ship, but not one of these houses could rival
</p>
<p>Doria, not even the Cicala who always kept not less
</p>
<p>than six galleys in commission. It is worth while to
</p>
<p>remind the Italians, who are so prone to forget the
</p>
<p>glory of their ancestors, that Andrea was the first to
</p>
<p>use armoured ships in battle. In his assault on Tunis,
</p>
<p>he had in his fleet a galleon called Sant' Anna, to which
</p>
<p>he was principally indebted for the victory which
</p>
<p>restored Muley-Hassan to his throne. This ship was
</p>
<p>the first ever clad with slabs of lead fastened by pivots
</p>
<p>of bronze. She was built at Nice in in 1530, and was
</p>
<p>equipped by the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem.
</p>
<p>She was manned by three hundred warriors and carried
</p>
<p>many guns. The solidity of her armour rendered her
</p>
<p>invulnerable to the enemy's fire. There were a large
</p>
<p>chapel and sumptuous saloons under her decks, and
</p>
<p>what seems more strange, ovens so well arranged that
</p>
<p>they furnished her crew with fresh bread daily.""'
</p>
<p>The Republic having broken with France, was pros-
</p>
<p>trated under the power of Spain and Doria. The
</p>
<p>citizens were profoundly indignant at this double servi-
</p>
<p>tude. They were prohibited by law, under the severest
</p>
<p>penalties, from proposing or advocating any change in
</p>
<p>the new constitution of the Republic ; so that many,

<p>62 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGI FIESCHI,
</p>
<p>before the attempt of Fieschi, ardently wished to throw
</p>
<p>off the yoke and place the country once more under
</p>
<p>the protection of France. In 1534, Granara and Cor-
</p>
<p>sanico Avent to Marseilles followed by many of the
</p>
<p>people with the intention of preparing a revolution.
</p>
<p>The enterprise became known by Doria, and Granara
</p>
<p>lost his head. Corsanico was captured l^y Doria,
</p>
<p>and, without the least form of condemnation, hurled
</p>
<p>into the sea.
</p>
<p>A few months later, Tomaso Sauli who had attempted
</p>
<p>a similar conspiracy Avith Cardinal di Agramonte, in
</p>
<p>Bologna, was condemned and quartered. The exiles
</p>
<p>excelled all others in their devotion to lil^erty ; and in
</p>
<p>1.536, led by Csesar Fregoso and Cagnino Gonzaga,
</p>
<p>with ten thousand foot and eight hundred horse, they
</p>
<p>marched to attack Genoa. This is not the place to
</p>
<p>relate how after a few skirmishes they broke up their
</p>
<p>camp ; it is only to our purpose to add that ]iundreds
</p>
<p>of citizens who were suspected of complicity A\dth the
</p>
<p>exiles lost their heads, while their houses were levelled
</p>
<p>with the earth.
</p>
<p>Not only in Genoa, but throughout Liguria these
</p>
<p>conspiracies abounded ; especially in ChiaA^ari, where
</p>
<p>the rcA^olt of Fregoso, of Avliich Stradiotto was the
</p>
<p>leader, had its origin. Blood AAdiencA^er it was shed, far
</p>
<p>from quenching the thirst for liberty, begot ncAv advo-

</p>
<p>GIANLUIGI FIESCHI. 65
</p>
<p>thousand ducats of gold due to Sforza for tlie feud of
</p>
<p>Pontremoli. Her chief care, however, was the educa-
</p>
<p>tion of her children. The eldest of them, Gianluigi,
</p>
<p>was ten years of age at the death of his father. The
</p>
<p>others were Gerolamo, Ottol)uono, Camilla (who be-
</p>
<p>came the wife of Nicolo Doria, illegitimate son of
</p>
<p>Cardinal Gerolamo), Angela, Caterina, and Scipione,
</p>
<p>born after his father's death. There was in addition a
</p>
<p>Cornelio, who though illegitimate (his mother was a
</p>
<p>certain Clementina of Torriglia), was much beloved on
</p>
<p>account of his spirited character. Some report that
</p>
<p>Sinibaldo had other illegitimate children, and number
</p>
<p>among them a Giulio and a Claudia, the latter of whom
</p>
<p>married into the family of the Ravaschieri.
</p>
<p>The children were instructed by Poalo Panza, a man
</p>
<p>of many literary acquirements, who trained them in
</p>
<p>liberal studies.
</p>
<p>The ardent spirit of Gianluigi iml^ibed less from the
</p>
<p>gentle instructions of Panza than from the masculine
</p>
<p>promptings of Maria della Rovere, who, in the fashion
</p>
<p>of Spartan mothers, exhorted him not to forget the
</p>
<p>paths by which his ancestors reached fame, contending
</p>
<p>as Guelphs for the rights of the people. Influenced by
</p>
<p>such counsels, he grew up into youth, and acquired
</p>
<p>strength both of body and mind in rough exercises of
</p>
<p>arms and in the chase. He was so skilful in these arts
</p>
<p>and in swimming, that the most robust of his rivals
</p>
<p>could not excel him. His mother taught him to hate
</p>
<p>the rule of strangers ; and he must very early have
</p>
<p>become an enemy to the Dorias, whom he saw grasping

</p>
<p>66 CONSPIRACY OF CxIANLUIGI FIESCHI.
</p>
<p>When he was eighteen years of age he took charge
</p>
<p>of his patrimony, which the prudence of his mother
</p>
<p>and the address of his guardian, Paolo Pansa, had so
</p>
<p>much improved that it is' said to have yiekled two
</p>
<p>hundred thousand crowns of rent. On the fourth of
</p>
<p>June, 1535, Charles V. confirmed his title to the do-
</p>
<p>mains of his ancestors, and continued in him the titles
</p>
<p>of Vicar-general in Italy, Prince of the empire, Count
</p>
<p>of the sacred palace, and imperial councillor. Perhaps
</p>
<p>it was on that occasion that he also received from
</p>
<p>Caesar the two thousand gold crowns mentioned by
</p>
<p>some writers.
</p>
<p>On coming to the city from Montobbio, he was hon-
</p>
<p>oured with festive receptions by all the nobility ; his
</p>
<p>manners and his gentle courtesy acquired him the love
</p>
<p>of the best among the people. Bonfadio"" describes
</p>
<p>him as beautiful of countenance, skilful in the use of
</p>
<p>arms and the management, of horses, remarkable for
</p>
<p>the beauty and strength of his body, manly in speech,
</p>
<p>grateful, obliging and winning to others : in fine his
</p>
<p>sweetness of character and vivacity of temper completes
</p>
<p>the picture of an Alcibiades, formed for captivating all
</p>
<p>hearts. In fact he was called an Alcibiades, and per-
</p>
<p>haps he was one, the vices included ; it is certain that
</p>
<p>in patriotism he deserved the name. It is said that
</p>
<p>when, mounted upon a bay saddle-horse, caparisoned
</p>
<p>with orange-coloured velvet trappings laced in Vermil-
</p>
<p>lion, and poitrel of silver, he rode through the narrow
</p>
<p>and crowded streets of Genoa followed by his valets

<p>and equerries, the people gathered from every side to
</p>
<p>do him honour, and he repaid them all with a salute
</p>
<p>full of winning courtesy. He dressed w^th the luxury
</p>
<p>which had come down to him from his illustrious
</p>
<p>ancestry. A picture, which many believe to be that of
</p>
<p>Gianluigi, represents him in a black velvet morning
</p>
<p>gown having the sleeves slashed, as was the fashion of
</p>
<p>the time ; there is a collar about his neck with cannon
</p>
<p>shaped points, and a chain from which hangs a
</p>
<p>medallion bearing the motto Gatto. His head is
</p>
<p>covered with a cap, also of black velvet, surmounted
</p>
<p>on the left side by a white plume. The limbs are
</p>
<p>comely and chaste, the air brave and corteous, the hair
</p>
<p>of a mulberry tint, the hands Y\^hite with fingers long
</p>
<p>and clean as those of a virgin, the eyes black and
</p>
<p>brilliant. Leandro Alberti describes him as a prudent,
</p>
<p>brave and eloquent young man. Porzio'" writes that
</p>
<p>he served not without honour in the wars of Lombardy
</p>
<p>under the standards of the marquis Vasto. But
</p>
<p>though fond of glory and successful in arms, he scorned
</p>
<p>to seek fame in other enterprises while the times
</p>
<p>forbade him to use his sword for national liberty.
</p>
<p>Endowed with such gifts, there was no illustrious
</p>
<p>family which did not seek his hand for a daughter.
</p>
<p>Among the beautiful damsels who in every part of Italy
</p>
<p>were ambitious of the title of Countess of Lavagna, he
</p>
<p>fixed his eyes upon Ginetta, daughter of Prince Adamo
</p>
<p>Cenj:urione. In every maidenly grace she was un-
</p>
<p>rivalled. The prince and his wife Oriettina, who loved

<p>successor in the admiralty and heir of all his possessions,
</p>
<p>adding that Centurione onght to renounce Fieschi and
</p>
<p>give the hand of his daughter to the prince's nephew.
</p>
<p>Centurione tlid not at tirst consent to break his faith ;
</p>
<p>but the solicitations of Andrea, with whom ho did not
</p>
<p>^^^sll to be at enmity, at leiig-th triumphed over his
</p>
<p>scruples and ho espoused Giaiietta to Gianettino giving
</p>
<p>her a dower of seventy thousand gold crowns of the
</p>
<p>sun.
</p>
<p>This violation of plighted iaith deeply wounded
</p>
<p>Giajietta who had set her aflections on Gianluigi ; and
</p>
<p>the Princess Oriettina took it so much to heart that
</p>
<p>she fell sick, and linding hci-self near death, as a last
</p>
<p>proof of her devotion to the Fieschi family had that

<p>life of St. Catherine Avi-itten which is still preserved in

<p>place from which he had risen, adopted an insolence of
</p>
<p>tone and a luxury of life which gave general offence.
</p>
<p>The natural insolence of his character had been greatly-
</p>
<p>increased by a military life and the habit of command.
</p>
<p>The control of twenty galleys, the succession as
</p>
<p>admiral and the proofs of personal courage which he
</p>
<p>had given raised him above the mass of the citizens ;*
</p>
<p>but instead of knightly courtesy he had a scornful and
</p>
<p>imperious look, and he never entered the city without
</p>
<p>being attended by a cortege of oflScers and armed men.
</p>
<p>He affected in a free land the sumptuous customs of
</p>
<p>princes.
</p>
<p>The people, whom he thrust aside, hated him ; the
</p>
<p>nobles caressed him as a means of getting privileges
</p>
<p>and honours, but they secretly despised him because
</p>
<p>he, not content to be their equal, regarded them as
</p>
<p>subjects. The plebeians mm-mured; "why such
</p>
<p>arrogant assumption in a land whose laws forbid
</p>
<p>despotism ! He who refuses to treat you as an equal
</p>
<p>wishes to make you his slave.t See how bravely he
</p>
<p>drives it towards princely powers ? "
</p>
<p>Thus the people abhorred Gianettino as its future
</p>
<p>tyrant, and longed for a favourable moment to strike
</p>
<p>down the Spanish power and restore the rule of the
</p>
<p>citizens. The old prince either encouraged or regarded
</p>
<p>without displeasure, the insolent habits of his heir
</p>
<p>which were bringing odium upon his house. Gianettino

</p>
<p>illustrate his own name by deeds not less worthy of
</p>
<p>fame, while the pride of the young Admiral grew so
</p>
<p>high that he insolently treated the count as his
</p>
<p>inferior.
</p>
<p>In the spring of 1539, Prince Doria was with the
</p>
<p>army in Sicily, and Torghud took advantage of his
</p>
<p>absence to make a piratical cruise in the Ligurian sea.
</p>
<p>Andrea, as soon as he received notice of the movement,
</p>
<p>sent his nephew to oppose the Corsair. The latter had
</p>
<p>already began his depradations along the coast, and
</p>
<p>had desolated Capraia, carrying off seven hundred
</p>
<p>prisoners and a large Genoese galleon. Gianettino,
</p>
<p>having a fleet of twenty galleys and a frigate com-
</p>
<p>manded by a certain Fra Marco, acted upon his
</p>
<p>knowledge of the Corsair's habit of beating up against
</p>
<p>the wind, and pursued him by the use of his oars. At the
</p>
<p>same time he sent his lieutenant, Giorgio Doria, with
</p>
<p>six galleys and the frigate to the bay of Giralatte where
</p>
<p>he believed the pirate to have run for shelter. His
</p>
<p>calculations proved to be accurate. Torghud, believing

</p>
<p>left two vessels to guard his booty, and sailed to attack
</p>
<p>Giorgio Doria mtli nine ships, two of which he had
</p>
<p>captured from the Venitians at Prevesa.
</p>
<p>Hearing the sound of the engagement, Gianettino,
</p>
<p>who was not far distant, sailed into the waters of
</p>
<p>Giralatte and joined his lieutenant. The Corsair seeing
</p>
<p>himself outnumbered, retired from the contest and
</p>
<p>endeavoured to escape ; but Gianettino pursued him so
</p>
<p>closely that he soon saw flight to be impossible and
</p>
<p>resolved to sell his life as dearly as possible.
</p>
<p>He raised his oars to the sound of trumpet and
</p>
<p>tymbal, according to Barbary customs and accepted the
</p>
<p>battle. The numbers and weight of vessels were equal,
</p>
<p>and both parties had equal enthusiasm, courage and
</p>
<p>obstinacy. But a cannon ball from a Genoese galley
</p>
<p>opened the side of the corsair's flag-ship, and a tempest
</p>
<p>of fire battered the rest into shapeless wrecks. Some
</p>
<p>of the pirates flung themselves desperately into the
</p>
<p>waves, and others turned the prows of their shattered
</p>
<p>vessels and attempted a new retreat. Among the latter
</p>
<p>was the terrible pirate Mami Rais de' Monasteri, in
</p>
<p>Africa who had once before been a prisoner of Antonio
</p>
<p>Doria and had been liberated on payment of a ransom.
</p>
<p>Giorgio pursued him now without success ; but with
</p>
<p>this exception the whole fleet was captured including
</p>
<p>the two vessels left by Torghud to guard his booty.
</p>
<p>These last were captured by Count Anguillara who
</p>
<p>was fighting under Doria's flag.
</p>
<p>The losses of Doria were small, but that of the

</p>
<p>enemy was terrible, since every one of them who swam
</p>
<p>GIANLUIOxI FIESCHI. 73
</p>
<p>to shore was mercilessly put to the sword by the
</p>
<p>Sicilians. Torghud was made prisoner and the chron-
</p>
<p>icles say that " after having been well flogged he was
</p>
<p>put in chains." He offered without avail fifteen thousand
</p>
<p>ducats for his ransom.
</p>
<p>On the 22nd of June 1539, at vespers, Gianettino
</p>
<p>entered the port of Genoa with the galleys captnired
</p>
<p>from the corsair. The citizens flocked in crowds to
</p>
<p>welcome the victors and two thousand christians who
</p>
<p>had been delivered from captivity, and to see the
</p>
<p>humbled lord of the main.
</p>
<p>Torghud managed with such tact that he obtained
</p>
<p>admission to the presence of the Princess Peretta, and
</p>
<p>addressed her in proud and threatening terms of re-
</p>
<p>proach for the harsh treatment which he had suffered ;
</p>
<p>but he soon adopted a humbler tone and begged to be
</p>
<p>sent to Messina, where Andrea Doria still remained
</p>
<p>with his army. This favour he obtained, and he re-
</p>
<p>newed to Andrea his offer of a heavy ransom, but still
</p>
<p>without success. A few years after, his countrymen,
</p>
<p>who valued him highly as a commander, offered new
</p>
<p>terms, and this time Andrea yielded to the temptation.
</p>
<p>The commission had not a sufficient sum to pay the
</p>
<p>ransom, and borrowed it in Genoa from the noble
</p>
<p>family Sopranis, giving as security the island of Tabarca.
</p>
<p>Thus Torghud, conquered by Genoese arms and ran-
</p>
<p>somed by Genoese gold, recovered his liberty and
</p>
<p>renewed his piracies on the seas to the detriment of
</p>
<p>all Christendom.

</p>
<p>It is needless to say that the success of Gianettino
</p>
<p>74 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGI FIESCHL
</p>
<p>aroused a spirit of emulation in Count Lavagna. But
</p>
<p>he saw that the Dorias, accusing him to Caesar of re-
</p>
<p>volutionary opinions, had shut him out from honours
</p>
<p>and official position ; and, not wishing to employ his
</p>
<p>talents in strengthening the Spanish power in Italy,
</p>
<p>he sought repose for his active spirit in domestic en-
</p>
<p>joyments.
</p>
<p>He married Eleonora, of the family of Prince Cybo,
</p>
<p>though his mother at first strongly opposed the alliance,
</p>
<p>preferring for her son a more wealthy and illustrious
</p>
<p>bride. By this marriage Fieschi came into a certain
</p>
<p>relationship to Catherine de' Medici, wife of Henry H.,
</p>
<p> Catherine Cybo, duchess of Camerino and aunt of
</p>
<p>Eleonora, being of the blood of the Medici, and there-
</p>
<p>fore of the queen of France.
</p>
<p>The marriage contract was prepared on the 15th of
</p>
<p>September, 1542 in Milan by Galeazzo Visconti and
</p>
<p>Gerolamo Bertobio, notaries, in the presence of
</p>
<p>Francesco Guiducci and Giuseppe Girlandoni, repre-
</p>
<p>sentative of Cardinal Innocent Cybo (the same to whom
</p>
<p>Philip Strozzi bequeathed his blood to be made into a
</p>
<p>pudding) and of Lorenzo and Ricciarda Cybo, on the
</p>
<p>one side, and Paolo Pansa the attorney of Count
</p>
<p>Fieschi on the other. The dower amounted to hardly
</p>
<p>nine thousand gold crowns of the sun and two thousand
</p>
<p>more for the wedding outfit. The Strozzi papers
</p>
<p>contain an act under date of January 18th 1543 written

</p>
<p>acknowledges that Rev. Ambrogio Calvi, attorney and
</p>
<p>GIANLUIGI PIESCHI. 75
</p>
<p>agent of Cybo, had paid four thousand gold crowns of
</p>
<p>the sun and deposited five thousand more with the
</p>
<p>brothers Giuliano and Agostino Salvaghi who had
</p>
<p>become securities for the dowry. The act further
</p>
<p>acknowledged the payment of one thousand crowns for
</p>
<p>jewellery and ornaments and provides that the other
</p>
<p>should be furnished by Cybo in silver, gold and gems.
</p>
<p>In the same act, Count Fieschi pledged as security for
</p>
<p>the dowry the castle of Cariseto and its appurtenances,
</p>
<p>which he had obtained by purchase, and he promised
</p>
<p>to obtain the consent of Csesar to the transfer of the
</p>
<p>estate within one year from the date of the instrument.
</p>
<p>The preparations for the wedding and the festivities
</p>
<p>connected with the espousals were on a splendid scale.
</p>
<p>The flower of the Genoese nobility came to congratulate
</p>
<p>the spouses at their residence in Vialata.
</p>
<p>Two powerful families possessed the magnificent hill
</p>
<p>of Carignano, the Fieschi, and the Sauli. Each family
</p>
<p>had there a splendid palace. During the minority of
</p>
<p>Gianluigi, silence had reigned in his, while that of the
</p>
<p>Sauli had been greatly enlarged and embellished.
</p>
<p>The Sauli were new nobles belonging to the popular
</p>
<p>party, like the Fieschi, Farnari, Promontori and Gius-
</p>
<p>tiniani ; yet few of the nobility, old or new, equalled
</p>
<p>them in wealth and gentility of blood. Marcantonio
</p>
<p>Sauli, a grave priest, whose life Soprani wrote, had
</p>
<p>splendidly adorned his  palace, and there the Genoese
</p>
<p>ladies were wont to meet for pleasure, and the elders
</p>
<p>of the city to debate on the afi'airs of the Republic.

<p>At the marriage of Gianluigi, his palace resumed its

</p>
<p>ancient gaiety, and the Sauli, surpassed by tho Fieschi
</p>
<p>in magnificence, were filled with envy ; and this was
</p>
<p>the first cause of those differences and rivalries which
</p>
<p>separated these distinguished families.
</p>
<p>Louis XII., who had been the guest of the count's
</p>
<p>grandfather, speaking of the sumptuousness of the
</p>
<p>palace in Vialata, said that it surpassed that of his own.
</p>
<p>And the palace of Fieschi was in fact a kingly resi-
</p>
<p>dence. The annalists tell us that the hill of Carignano,*
</p>
<p>on which it stood, was adorned with fifty villas, houses
</p>
<p>and gardens. The principal of these were the palace
</p>
<p>of Madonna Marisla, the mother of Cardinal Sauli,
</p>
<p>those of Nicolo, Giovanni Battista and Giuliano Sauli,
</p>
<p>and the houses of Pietro Negrone and Rolando Ferrari.
</p>
<p>From the summit of this hill you have a command-
</p>
<p>ing view of the city, and of the port crowded with a
</p>
<p>forest of masts ; the villas of Albaro are spread out
</p>
<p>before you ; gardens and palaces cover the slopes of
</p>
<p>gentle declivities, or are scattered along the sides of
</p>
<p>the mountains which, swelling skyward, make at once
</p>
<p>a rampart and a diadem for Genoa. Valleys and slopes

</p>
<p>until Portofino, with its wave-washed rocks, closes on

<p>that side the charming basin of the gulf ; while west-
</p>
<p>ward lie the bewitching shores of Voltri, Albissola and

<p>cities, castles and villages, which are garlanded round
</p>
<p>with orchards and olive groves, reflecting their verdure
</p>
<p>in the crystal mirror of the JMediterranean.
</p>
<p>In the centre of this smiling scene, roofed with a sky
</p>
<p>yet more bewitching than the landscape, rose the palace
</p>
<p>of Count Fieschi, faced with alternate slabs of white
</p>
<p>and black marble, crowned with two grand towers, and
</p>
<p>decorated with emblems and statues on its front and
</p>
<p>sides.
</p>
<p>In the Fogliazzi Notarili, which are preserved in
</p>
<p>the city library, there is an instrument dated March
</p>
<p>30th, 1468 executed by Luca and Matteo Fieschi, sons
</p>
<p>of Daniel and Ginevrina Fieschi, from which we learn
</p>
<p>that in front of the palace there lay an open lawn
</p>
<p>extending towards the sea, that the villas and orchards
</p>
<p>of the estate covered the whole space as far as San
</p>
<p>Giacomo. On the east, west and south the gi'ounds
</p>
<p>were bounded by public streets, and on the north lay
</p>
<p>the farms of Francesco del Monte and of the heir of
</p>
<p>Oberto Delia Eovere. Subsequently to the date of this
</p>
<p>instrument, Bartolomeo Fieschi added villas and fields
</p>
<p>to this estate ; but on the southern side it suffered
</p>
<p>some detriment from the opening of stone quarries by
</p>
<p>the government for which the Doge Battista Fregoso
</p>
<p>paid damages in 1479.
</p>
<p>We also learn, from the records of Bailia clella
</p>
<p>Moneta in the bank of St. George, that sixty citizens
</p>

</p>
<p>authorized the rectors of the commune to quarry stone
</p>
<p>on private property, and for this purpose some lands
</p>
<p>were ceded l)y the same Bartolomeo Fieschi, thus
</p>
<p>decreasing the extent of his estate southward, though
</p>
<p>it did not reach the sea before this cession.
</p>
<p>Behind the palace, lay a botanical garden which
</p>
<p>Sinibaldo had enriched with rare species of plants and
</p>
<p>beautified with little lakes and fountains making it,
</p>
<p>according to Spotorno, among the first of its kind in
</p>
<p>Italy.
</p>
<p>Sinibaldo employed excellent architects and builders,
</p>
<p>whose names have not come down to us, to decorate
</p>
<p>and enrich his home, some time before Paul III., on his
</p>
<p>return from Nice, lodged here as Fieschi's guest. The
</p>
<p>wrath of man, rather than the hand of time, has so
</p>
<p>completely destroyed these- monuments that not even
</p>
<p>the ruins remain for our admiration. The reader will
</p>
<p>therefore receive mth favour the results of our re-
</p>
<p>searches into the true position and boundaries of the
</p>
<p>Fieschi palace and gardens, which in their time were
</p>
<p>famed for their outward magnificence and for the
</p>
<p>sculptures, carved work and pictures within the palace.
</p>
<p>Of these works of art all but one have perished from
</p>
<p>the memory of man. This was a painting in the
</p>
<p>vestibule which treated the fable of the giants hurling
</p>
<p>thunderbolts at Jupiter and some enterprises of the
</p>
<p>Fieschi family. We think it just to inform our readers
</p>
<p>of its origin and character.

<p>like those of every part of Italy, to adorn their mansions
</p>
<p>GIANLUIGI FIESCHI. 79
</p>
<p>with paintings allusive to the exploits of themselves
</p>
<p>or their families. For example, history has preserved
</p>
<p>the memory of an allegory given to Gerolamo Adorno
</p>
<p>by Paolo Giovio, which was sketched in colours by
</p>
<p>Titian, and wrought into a rich eml^roidery by Agnolo
</p>
<p>di Madonna, a Venitian embroiderer. Giovio, in his
</p>
<p>brief dialogue, speaks of three emblems which were
</p>
<p>painted in many places in the Fieschi palace. The
</p>
<p>bishop of Nocera writes that Sinibaldo and Ottobuono,
</p>
<p>with whom he was on familiar terms, asked him to
</p>
<p>execute an allegorical picture, representing the ven-
</p>
<p>geance they had taken for the death of their brother,
</p>
<p>Count Gerolamo, whom the Fregosi had cruelly mur-
</p>
<p>dered. This revenge had removed from among the
</p>
<p>living the instruments of the deed, Zaccaria Fregoso,
</p>
<p>Signors Fregosino, Lodovico and Guido Fregosi. With
</p>
<p>this bloody reprisal the Fieschi satisfied their anger,
</p>
<p>saying that no Fregoso lived to boast that he had
</p>
<p>spilled the blood of a Fieschi.
</p>
<p>Giovio represented this tragic vengeance by an ele-
</p>
<p>phant attacked by a dragon. The latter attempts to
</p>
<p>wind himself about the legs of his antagonist, so as to
</p>
<p>pierce his bowels and insert his deadly poison. But
</p>
<p>the elephant, knowing by instinct the danger to which
</p>
<p>he is exposed, turns himself round and round until he
</p>
<p>places a rock or a tree between himself and his enemy.
</p>
<p>Then he beats the di'agon to death. This allegory was
</p>
<p>interesting, from the fine contrast of the two animals,
</p>
<p>and the Spanish motto. No vos allabareis  by which
</p>
<p>Fieschi would say to the Fregosi, " You cannot

<p>boast of your crime ngainst our blood."
</p>
<p>80 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGI FIESCHI.
</p>
<p>Sinibaldo had another allegory executed in the palace
</p>
<p>of Vialata. He and Ottobuono were forming an
</p>
<p>alliance with the Adorni and many of their partisans
</p>
<p>urged them to protract the negotiations, since the army
</p>
<p>of the king of France was near at hand and Ottaviano
</p>
<p>Fregoso, supported by his party, had a very firm hold on
</p>
<p>the government and would be able to make a spirited
</p>
<p>defence if assailed at that moment.
</p>
<p>To this the Fieschi replied that they well knew the
</p>
<p>time for action, and on this incident they asked Giovio
</p>
<p>to execute an allegory. The artist remembering what
</p>
<p>Pliny says of the halcyons who await the spring soletice
</p>
<p>to make their nests and lay their eggs when the waves
</p>
<p>are tranquil, painted a calm sea and a serene sky with
</p>
<p>a nest extending from the prow to the poop of a vessel
</p>
<p>with the heads of the halcyons raised over the prow
</p>
<p>and a motto in French  nous savons Men le temj^s 
</p>
<p>meaning to say we well know when to make war on
</p>
<p>our adversaries ; and the chronicler adds, they thus
</p>
<p>foreshadowed their triumph over their rivals.
</p>
<p>The Fieschi palace had other allegorical paintings
</p>
<p>treating various subjects. Some of them described
</p>
<p>tender love passages in the lives of the Fieschi. In
</p>
<p>one was told the story of a gentlewoman loved by Sini-
</p>
<p>baldo. It would seem that she grew jealous and re-
</p>
<p>proached him with want of fidelity, because he mingled
</p>
<p>much in the company of other dames. Sinibaldo, in
</p>
<p>order to excuse and justify himself with his mistress,
</p>
<p>demanded of Giovio an appropriate representation in
</p>
<p>allegory. The artist represented a mariner's compass

</p>
<p>sky spangled with golden stars, and underneath the
</p>
<p>motto, aspicit unam. The sense of this allegory being
</p>
<p>that, though the heaven is full of beautiful stars, the
</p>
<p>needle points to one alone, that is, the North star. The
</p>
<p>offended dame was cured of her jealousy. The alle-
</p>
<p>gory was much praised, says Giovio, by many persons,
</p>
<p>including Fieschi's secretary, Paolo Panza. We have
</p>
<p>already said that the elect of the city came to con-
</p>
<p>gratulate Grianluigi on his return to Carignano, and
</p>
<p>that the luxury displayed by him on the occasion of
</p>
<p>his marriage surpassed all bounds. Some conception
</p>
<p>of this luxury may be formed when we remember that
</p>
<p>Genoa was at that time the richest city in Italy, and
</p>
<p>that its wealth found expression in a prodigality of
</p>
<p>money so excessive, that Partenopeo in an assembly,
</p>
<p>at the time Giovanni Battista Sauli entered upon the
</p>
<p>magistracy, prayed the government to impose restric-
</p>
<p>tions on the waste of the national wealth. In fact,
</p>
<p>on the 16th of December, 1500, the elders issued a
</p>
<p>proclamation forbidding wives to spend on their per-
</p>
<p>sonal attire more than a third part of their dowers,
</p>
<p>and ordained other sumptuary prohibitions.
</p>
<p>The flower of the Genoese youth frequented the
</p>
<p>Fieschi palace, not merely for amusement and pastime,
</p>
<p>but they cultivated there letters and polite studies.
</p>
<p>Liguria had at that period some euridite scholars, who
</p>
<p>employed themselves in teaching youth the sciences
</p>
<p>and eloquence. The Fieschi did not rank last in these
</p>
<p>pursuits ; and it had become a family tradition for the
</p>
<p>sons to cultivate letters, and acquire the doctorate in

<p>and, though it has been written that he never had

<p>verses of such merit that Ariosto compared them to

<p>those of Trissino and Molza, lived in the house of
</p>
<p>Gianluigi, and aided him in his literary pursuits.
</p>
<p>Through his instructions the young count acquired a
</p>
<p>love for learning, and was led to open his doors to the

<p>most cultivated men of his time. And these were

<p>more numerous than might be expected in a city

</p>
<p>Braccelli and Antonio Gallo had acquired repute as

<p>historians : Giacobo dc' Fornari, as a Greek scholar :
</p>
<p>Geronimo Palmare, Bartolomeo Guistiniano, Nicolo

<p>da Brignali and Bartolomeo were men of great learn-

</p>
<p>and philosophy.

<p>These noble examples were followed by Nicolo Sena-

<p>and P. Ilarione, who Avi^ote learnedly on the subject of

</p>
<p>by his fame in the field, and particularly that obtained
</p>
<p>at Golletta, where he was the first to mount the hostile
</p>
<p>ramparts. Among our warrior poets we should not
</p>
<p>pass by the brave Cesare Fregoso, though he had been
</p>
<p>killed a few years earlier by the Spaniards. He wrote
</p>
<p>Latin songs which were highly praised, but have
</p>
<p>unfortunately been lost. He was a man truly great
</p>
<p>in everything. Matteo Bandello, who took shelter in
</p>
<p>his palace, and received from him both protection and
</p>
<p>honour, bears testimony which is alike honourable to
</p>
<p>both protector and protected. But it would be beyond

<p>our province to enumerate all the learned men of that

</p>
<p>Perhaps the reader will be pleased to know some-

<p>countess Eleonora. She was herself instructed in

<p>letters, as well as in all those accomplishments which

<p>became a lady of her time.
</p>
<p>Among her friends were Arcangela di Negra, and also

</p>
<p>Among the latter her answer to Doctor Tomaso dal

<p>Moro, who had endeavoured to win her to the

<p>new Corinna. Livia Spinola has left us good rhymes ;
</p>
<p>Maddalena Pallavicini, wife of the marquis of Ceva,
</p>
<p>wrote verses which are not without merit, and Placida
</p>
<p>Pallavicini won the encomiums of Paolo Foglietta.
</p>
<p>The first rank in the Pallavicini sisterhood is due to
</p>
<p>Argentina, who became the wife of Guido Rangone,
</p>
<p>and whose literary accomplishments were the theme of
</p>
<p>the wisest men of that period.
</p>
<p>Gerolamo Ruscelli da Viterbo, a literary man of high
</p>
<p>repute among his contemporaries, tells us that the
</p>
<p>greater part of the Genoese gentlewomen cultivated
</p>
<p>belles-lettres ; and in an epistle which he published in
</p>
<p>.1552, he enumerates among the most rare women of
</p>
<p>Italy twenty-three of Genoa and six of Savona. He
</p>
<p>mentions among the first of Geonese ladies, Pellegrina,
</p>
<p>Lercari, " a virgin not less virtuous than beautiful,"
</p>
<p>and Nicoletta Centurione-Grimaldi, on whom he
</p>
<p>lavishes every sort of praise. Among those of Savona
</p>
<p>he speaks of Leonora Fallctti, countess of Melazzo, as
</p>
<p>one whose happy compositions had stimulated the
</p>
<p>ambition of many learned men. Among the poetesses
</p>
<p>of Liguria, are also to be numbered Benedetta Spinola,
</p>
<p>daughter of Alfonso marquis of Garessio, and wife of
</p>
<p>Giovanni Battista, prince of the blood of Savoy and
</p>
<p>lord of Racconigi ; Claudia della Rovere, countess of
</p>
<p>Vinovo in Piedmont ; and Caterina Gastodenghi, who
</p>
<p>enjoyed the praises of Dolce, Parabasco, and many
</p>
<p>others.

<p>The gentle consort of Count Fieschi held the central

</p>
<p>place in this circle of cultivated gentlewomen ; but
</p>
<p>unfortunately the rhymes of Eleonora, which gave her
</p>
<p>so much credit with her contemporaries, are no longer
</p>
<p>in existence. The few specimens of her talent which
</p>
<p>remain to us give ample proof of her genius. They
</p>
<p>were published in Turin in 1573, with the verses of
</p>
<p>Faustino Tasso, a Venitian, and of three other poetesses,
</p>
<p>of whom one belonged to her husband's house, that is,
</p>
<p>Ortensia Lomellina de' Fieschi. The others were Ni-
</p>
<p>coletta Celsa and Laura Gabrielli degli Alciati,
</p>
<p>Eleonora was not inferior to her aunt Caterina, duchess
</p>
<p>of Camerino, who knew Hebrew, Greek, and Latin,
</p>
<p>and who found comfort when Paul III, deprived her
</p>
<p>husband of his possessions, in the friendship of wise
</p>
<p>men and in philosophical studies.
</p>
<p>But the genial studies, the love and charms of his
</p>
<p>wife, did not enervate the manly spirit of the count.
</p>
<p>At every step his mother's voice reproached him for
</p>
<p>attempting no daring enterprises. From the towers of
</p>
<p>his palace he saw Genoa lying at his feet and seeming
</p>
<p>to call him to deliver her. He looked out upon the
</p>
<p>sea and saw it whitened with the sails of Gianettino,
</p>
<p>his rival and the expected despot of his native land. A
</p>
<p>sense of magnanimous indignation warmed his bosom.
</p>
<p>The son of Sinibaldo, the heir of such an illustrious

<p>house, could not endure the sight of his country sitting

</p>
<p>Palermo protested in her hero Giovanni Squarcialupo
</p>
<p>whose death consecrated her cause ; she renewed her
</p>
<p>life in the patriotism of the Abbattelli, who could not
</p>
<p>turn back her destiny. Naples was lit up with insur-
</p>
<p>rection. Milan, always foremost in magnanimous
</p>
<p>enterprises, raised her head, when Morone incited the
</p>
<p>marquis of Pescara against the emperor, and that
</p>
<p>nobleman first promised to lead the revolution and
</p>
<p>then betrayed it to the tyrant. Perugia in vain set
</p>
<p>up the banner of the Republic ; Florence fought, Siena
</p>
<p>renewed the memory of Saguntum, and Lucca burned
</p>
<p>audacious fires of civil and religious liberty. There

<p>was scarcely a city or village which did not recall its

<p>Latin traditions, and combat the monarchical power
</p>
<p>which was descending like a tempest on the whole

<p>leprosy, opened her doors to the fugitive patriots, and

<p>they, having broken their swords, continued to protest

<p>Donate Gianotti, the successor of Machiavelli, as
</p>
<p>secretary of the Florentine Republic, wrote a wonder-
</p>
<p>ful address to Paul III., in which he urged that Genoa
</p>
<p>should be redeemed from the hands of the Dorias and
</p>
<p>Spaniards, and the republic and principalities bound
</p>
<p>in alliance with France, as necessary measures for the
</p>
<p>defence of national liberty. The object of this dis-
</p>
<p>course, so rich in political wisdom, was to warn the
</p>
<p>Italians of the danger of neglecting their own interests.
</p>
<p>" They cannot," he says, " secure their safety except
</p>
<p>by making preparations to take up arms against that
</p>
<p>power which can only secure itself in its possessions
</p>
<p>by enslaving all Italy''' Gianotti urged the import-
</p>
<p>ance of tempting the confederates of the emperor, and,
</p>
<p>if possible, enlisting them in the national cause, and
</p>
<p>adds : " The State of Genoa under the authority of
</p>
<p>Andrea Doria, ought to be reconciled to the King of
</p>
<p>France ; and I do not believe the Genoese would be
</p>
<p>disinclined to it, for their sympathies are for France,
</p>
<p>and they know the advantages to a Republic of inde-
</p>
<p>pendence and the free use of their political power.
</p>
<p>It was useful to the Genoese, at the moment, to follow
</p>
<p>the influence of Doria and, ceasing to be French, to
</p>
<p>become imperialists, as a step towards liberty ; but at
</p>
<p>present it would not be less useful to them to unite,
</p>
<p>without altering the form of their state, with the other
</p>
<p>governments of the Peninsula."

<p>Gianotti expressed the hope that the Pope's author-
</p>
<p>ity might induce Dona to risk his fortunes with those
</p>
<p>of Italy, and he thinks there coukl not be obstacles on
</p>
<p>the part of the French monarch, because political pru-
</p>
<p>dence would counsel him to ally himself with Genoa,
</p>
<p>without seeking to govern her as a subject province :
</p>
<p>" rather," he adds, " the French king should refuse to
</p>
<p>govern Genoa, as such power would involve most em-
</p>
<p>barrassments for himself. The French king should
</p>
<p>make allies of the Geonese, solely in order to detach
</p>
<p>them from his enemies." He makes a similar suggestion
</p>
<p>to all the Italian states, especially Siena and Florence,
</p>
<p>" who for common interests ought to make common
</p>
<p>cause." He argues that such a policy would free these
</p>
<p>states from that dependence on the empire, which some
</p>
<p>believed necessary to their existence, and would give
</p>
<p>them the repute of being able to live without leaning
</p>
<p>on foreign support. He advocates the policy which
</p>
<p>adjusts itself to the conveniences and changes of the
</p>
<p>times, and enforces this reasoning by the conduct and
</p>
<p>aims of the Emperor which left the Italians no hope
</p>
<p>but in war. He advises that arms and munitions both
</p>
<p>of offence and defence be acquired with as much haste
</p>
<p>as possible ; that friendship be cultivated with foreign
</p>
<p>powers. " Peace" he concludes, " may he more fatal
</p>
<p>than war J for the former must in the end subject us to
</p>
<p>despotism, while war may fortify our present liberties
</p>
<p>and restore those of which we have been defrauded."*

<p>Florentine statesman is very much to our purpose, and
</p>
<p>tliat his counsels were warmly welcomed by the Count
</p>
<p>Lavagna is manifest, for his scheme is moulded upon
</p>
<p>Gionotti's plan. The Florentine laid down three rules
</p>
<p>of policy,  That our provinces, especially Genoa, break
</p>
<p>with the Emperor ; that they form alliance with
</p>
<p>France  not to put themselves in her power, but to
</p>
<p>keep her from becoming their enemy,  and that, with-
</p>
<p>out seeking material aid from France, all the Republics
</p>
<p>should make vigorous preparation for war against the
</p>
<p>empire.
</p>
<p>On these principles Fieschi constructed his too-much
</p>
<p>calumniated plot. Those who have written about it,
</p>
<p>without studying the character of the times, rather as
</p>
<p>romancers than historians, have transmitted us a fable
</p>
<p>that he sought the supreme control of the Republic ;
</p>
<p>but he sought no other end than to bring back the
</p>
<p>government to its ancient principles. Revolution in
</p>
<p>Genoa never aimed at enslaving the people. In those
</p>
<p>centuries we had foreign generals and ministers among
</p>
<p>us, but never absolute rulers ; and if these ministers
</p>
<p>attempted tyranny, they paid for their audacity with
</p>
<p>their blood, like Opizzino d' Alzate, or were expelled,
</p>
<p>like Trivulzio and others.
</p>
<p>Gianluigi was not so short-sighted as not to know
</p>
<p>the temper of the Geonese, or to forget the lesson of
</p>
<p>then recent examples. He sought not to usurp the
</p>
<p>government and become the oppressor of the people,
</p>
<p>but to confer on his native land the blessings of its

</p>
<p>Though writers in the pay of Spain accused him of
</p>
<p>corrupt ambition, lust of gold and thirst for blood, it
</p>
<p>is time to render him the tardy justice of saying that
</p>
<p>no document can be quoted which proves that he
</p>
<p>cherished such infamous projects  projects alien to his
</p>
<p>gentle and humane character, to the traditions of his
</p>
<p>family, and to the spirit of the Guelph party then sup-
</p>
<p>ported by the most sound and cultivated intellects of
</p>
<p>Italy.
</p>
<p>Sismondi alone, of all historians, seems to us to have
</p>
<p>comprehended the real object of' Fieschi. " Andi-ea
</p>
<p>Doria," he writes, " had restored the name of Republic
</p>
<p>to his country, but not liberty nor independence. He
</p>
<p>called to the government a strict aristocracy, of whom
</p>
<p>Gianettino was the master. He bound the fate of his
</p>
<p>country to that of Austria, by bonds which humiliated
</p>
<p>the best part of the Geonese. Fieschi planned his con-
</p>
<p>spiracy in order to deliver the country from the yoke
</p>
<p>of Spain and the Dorias." '""
</p>
<p>The events we proceed to describe set the seal of
</p>
<p>truth upon the words of this illustrious historian.
</p>
<p>Some tell us that Gianluigi plotted, so early as 1537,
</p>
<p>with Cesare Fregoso, to place the Republic in the
</p>
<p>hands of the French king ; for which, Bonfadio adds,f
</p>
<p>he would have lost his head, if Andrea Doria had not
</p>
<p>saved him from the rigours of the law. This report
</p>
<p>was set on foot by the marquis Vasto, governor of

</p>
<p>and Antonio Rancone, the messengers of King Francis
</p>
<p>t<.) Soliman, endeavoured to justify his treachery by
</p>
<p>declaring, among other things, that he had found in
</p>
<p>commentaries of Fregoso, (which he never had in his
</p>
<p>hands) proofs that Fieschi took part in that plot. But
</p>
<p>these pretended conspiracies with the King of France
</p>
<p>are now destroyed by very authoritative testimony.
</p>
<p>If Bonfadio had remembered that, in 1537, Fieschi
</p>
<p>was still a lad, he would have hesitated to adopt that
</p>
<p>slander. It is known, too, that personal enmity ex-
</p>
<p>isted between the families Fregoso and Fieschi of so
</p>
<p>bitter a character as to forbid all possibility of common
</p>
<p>political views and intimate secret negotiations. The
</p>
<p>memory of the day, when Doge Giano Fregoso and his
</p>
<p>brother Fregosino, encountering Gerolamo Fieschi,
</p>
<p>killed him with many blows, was not effaced ; nor was
</p>
<p>it forgotten that the Fieschi retired to their castles to
</p>
<p>plan their revenge, collected three thousand soldiers
</p>
<p>and besieged the city from the valley of Bisagno,
</p>
<p>where the Fregosi were entrenched. A battle was
</p>
<p>fought, in which the Doge was defeated. The Fieschi
</p>
<p>entered the city as victors, killed Zaccaria Fregoso,
</p>
<p>dragged his corpse through the populous streets, and
</p>
<p>elevated Antonietto Adorno to the office of Doge.
</p>
<p>From that day a mortal hatred had divided the two
</p>
<p>families. This fact alone renders the story of a plot
</p>
<p>with Fregoso highly improbable.
</p>
<p>Bonfadio also accuses Fieschi of having attempted
</p>
<p>to betray the city to Pietro Strozzi, which, he says,

<p>attack Genoa and to act as a guide. The circumstance
</p>
<p>-deserves investigation.
</p>
<p>In August, 1544, when the emperor had marched
</p>
<p>into France, Pietro Strozzi coliected an army at Mi-
</p>
<p>randola, with the design of attacking the territories of
</p>
<p>Milan in concert with Enghein. Aided by Pierluigi
</p>
<p>Farnese, he had abready crossed the Po, and entered
</p>
<p>the provinoe of Piacenza, where he lay encamped on
</p>
<p>the slopes of the Ligurian mountains, when, being
</p>
<p>assailed by Ridolfo Baglione and imperial troops sent
</p>
<p>from 'Naples, he was forced to fall back to Serravalle,
</p>
<p>on the banks of the Scrivia. Here he was overtaken
</p>
<p>by the prince of Salerno, and forced to accept battle.
</p>
<p>The fight was at first favourable to Strozzi, but in the
</p>
<p>end he suffered defeat. There were few killed, because
</p>
<p>the Italians recognized their brotherhood on the field
</p>
<p>of battle, threw down their arms and embraced each
</p>
<p>other. Strozzi took shelter with the remnant of his
</p>
<p>army in the territory of the Republic. The Fieschi,
</p>
<p>fearing the rage of a conquered Strozzi, and perhaps
</p>
<p>an assault upon Montobbio, fled into the city, and
</p>
<p>remained there until Strozzi evacuated his camp in the
</p>
<p>Apennines. This shows how completely BonfLidio
</p>
<p>was in error.^

<p>94 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGI FIESCHI.
</p>
<p>with Fregoso nor Strozzi, he certainly had political
</p>
<p>relations with other persons ; and this is what remains
</p>
<p>after eliminating the falsehoods spread abroad by
</p>
<p>Spain.
</p>
<p>Having formed the purpose of deposing the old
</p>
<p>nobility and restoring the popular government, Fieschi
</p>
<p>saw that his best policy was to follow the fortunes of
</p>
<p>the Adorni, whose party his ancestors, and especially
</p>
<p>his father, had zealously supported. The views of
</p>
<p>Gianluigi found an echo in the breast of Barnaba
</p>
<p>Adorno, count of Silvano, of whom we must briefly
</p>
<p>speak.
</p>
<p>Silvano is situated in the Val d'Orba in Monferrato,
</p>
<p>two miles beyond the Giovi. On the east and west
</p>
<p>lie the villages of St. Cristoforo, then a feud of the
</p>
<p>Dorias, of Montaldeo  honored as the birth-place, at
</p>
<p>a later period, of cardinal Mazzarino  and Mornese, a
</p>
<p>feud of the Serras ; on the south lay Cremolino, pos-
</p>
<p>sessed by the Dorias ; and on the north the castles of
</p>
<p>Carpineto, and Montaldo, and the city of Alessandria.
</p>
<p>Nearer and almost contiguous to Silvano stood the
</p>
<p>castles of Lerma, Tagliolo, Ovada, Eocca Grimaldi,
</p>
<p>Capriatxi, and Castelletto Val d'Orba, also feuds of
</p>
<p>Barnalja Adorno.
</p>
<p>Silvano was fortified by two large and strong towers,
</p>
<p>and was the usual residence of Adorno, who had
</p>
<p>strong friends and political allies in all the castles and
</p>
<p>villages around him. He devoted his early years to
</p>
<p>arms, and, rising to the rank of colonel under Csesar,

</p>
<p>he acquii'ed distinction in Provence and in the king-
</p>
<p>THE PLOTS OF FIESCHl. 95
</p>
<p>dom of Naples. In the latter he obtained the feud of
</p>
<p>Caprarica. Weary of the tumults of war, he retired
</p>
<p>to his home and married Maddalena, daughter of the
</p>
<p>Doge Antoniotto Adorno. In beauty, this woman was
</p>
<p>excelled by few persons of her time.
</p>
<p>The quiet of Adorno was disturbed by serious quar=
</p>
<p>rels, especially by one with count Paolo Pico of Mirau=
</p>
<p>dola, who attacked his lands and put Castelletto to
</p>
<p>fire and sword. This strife, so bloody in the civil war
</p>
<p>which it inflamed, was not less spirited before the
</p>
<p>tribunals of the empire ; but it is not our province to
</p>
<p>enlarge on its many vicissitudes.
</p>
<p>Adorno cherished the design of cultivating the
</p>
<p>popular party, and so raising the declining fortunes of
</p>
<p>his house, and he soon began to attempt plots against
</p>
<p>the new order in Genoa,
</p>
<p>In this purpose he turned to the count of Lavagna,
</p>
<p>through the mediation of a Fra Badaracco, and, after
</p>
<p>many debates, it was resolved to unite their forces for
</p>
<p>the overthrow of the Dorias. Barnaba was to be
</p>
<p>elevated to the Dogate, and the count to govern the
</p>
<p>eastern Riviera as his father had done before him,
</p>
<p>They further agreed to place the Republic under the
</p>
<p>protection of France, without prejudice, however, to
</p>
<p>its liberties, and solely to secure it from the vengeance
</p>
<p>of Csesar. Fra Badaracco, in order to find partisans, held
</p>
<p>conversations mth some gentlemen whom he supposed
</p>
<p>to be dissatisfied with the government of the Dorias.
</p>
<p>But these persons exposed the matter in the senate :

</p>
<p>Adorno were found on his person. After having been
</p>
<p>tortured, Bardaracco was decapitated, having confessed
</p>
<p>that, l)esides Adorno, . . Gianluigi Fieschi and Pietra
</p>
<p>Paolo Lasagna were concerned in the conspiracy. The
</p>
<p>senators, not being able to obtain proofs of their guilt,
</p>
<p>decided not to prosecute the conspirators.
</p>
<p>Having thus failed in his first effort, the count
</p>
<p>sought new paths to his end. He saw that it was
</p>
<p>necessary to have an understanding with the king of
</p>
<p>France, as a means of restraining the army which the
</p>
<p>emperor had in the territories of Milan, and to secure
</p>
<p>the capture of the fleet of Doria, which was the chief
</p>
<p>prop of the imperial power. It was plain that these
</p>
<p>naval and military forces would easily quell any insur-
</p>
<p>rection, unless the troops of France in Piedmont were
</p>
<p>directed to hold the army of Csesar in check. Gian-
</p>
<p>luigi was induced to enter into an understanding witli
</p>
<p>France by one of his relatives by blood, of whom we
</p>
<p>ought briefly to speak, because his name has been
</p>
<p>almost forgotten in our domestic histories.
</p>
<p>A branch of the Fieschi family, expelled from Genoa
</p>
<p>in 1389, had taken up its residence in Piedmont and
</p>
<p>acquired there both possessions and honours. A
</p>
<p>certain Giovanni Fieschi  made bishop of Vercelli liy
</p>
<p>Clement VI., in 1348  gave a share of the temporal
</p>
<p>government of his diocese to his brother Nicolo, and
</p>
<p>conferred upon him some lands and castles.
</p>
<p>We find in the archives of the court at Turin that
</p>
<p>the Fieschi ruled in Masserano until 1381, and that

</p>
<p>count Verde. Some few years later, or in 1394, Lodo-
</p>
<p>vico Fiesclii, also bishop of Vercelli and cardinal,
</p>
<p>petitioned Boniface IX. for the repayment of a large
</p>
<p>sum of money spent by him in maintaining the rights
</p>
<p>of his church, and he obtained pefrmission to alienate
</p>
<p>from the jurisdiction of the church the castles of
</p>
<p>Masserano and Moncrivello, and to confer the feud
</p>
<p>upon his brother Antonio. This investiture was con-
</p>
<p>firmed by subsequent popes, especially by Julius II. ;
</p>
<p>and Alexander VI. added, in 1498, the feuds of Curino,
</p>
<p>Brusnengo, Flecchia, and Riva, assigning them to the
</p>
<p>brothers Innocenzo and Pier Luca.
</p>
<p>The first of these had a son named Lodovico, and
</p>
<p>this Lodovico a daughter named Beatrice, whose hand
</p>
<p>her father gave to Filiberto Ferrero, a citizen of Biella,
</p>
<p>adopting him as a son.
</p>
<p>The Fieschi possessions in this way passed into the
</p>
<p>family of Ferrero ; and he, having obtained for his son
</p>
<p>Besso the hand of Camilla, niece of Paul III., secured
</p>
<p>the investiture of Masserano, then created a Marquisate.
</p>
<p>Whoever is desirous of learning how these feuds came
</p>
<p>into the possession of the Ferreri to the exclusion of

<p>the male line, and particularly of Gregory and Pier

<p>This Pier Luca IL, lord of Crevacuore, where he had

<p>an excellent mint, of whose coinage some specimens

<p>are preserved to us, constantly revolved revolutionary

<p>of Pier Luca, Gianluigi bought the Farnesian galleys,
</p>
<p>of which we shall presently speak.
</p>
<p>The count received Pier Luca at his house in Vialata
</p>
<p>with every mark of affection, and lent a willing ear to
</p>
<p>his suggestions ; but fearing that France would wish
</p>
<p>to reduce Genoa to the condition of a French province,
</p>
<p>he resolved to ascertain the views of the ministers of
</p>
<p>that power, and to obtain pledges for the security of
</p>
<p>popular liberty.
</p>
<p>He entrusted this negotiation to Gian Francesco,
</p>
<p>(called Gagnino) Gonzaga of the family of the dukes
</p>
<p>of SabbionCj a brave soldier, hostile to the empire.
</p>
<p>With his uncle Frederick he had fought against Csesar
</p>
<p>at Parma, and later as a colonel of the Florentines in
</p>
<p>the celebrated siege of Florence. Being an open par-
</p>
<p>tisan of the French, he was banished from his native
</p>
<p>land.
</p>
<p>Gonzaga presented himself before the French council
</p>
<p>of state, and reminded the ministers of the many
</p>
<p>services which the Fieschi family had rendered to the
</p>
<p>French crown ; he showed clearly that the only means
</p>
<p>of driving the Spaniards from Lombardy, was to
</p>
<p>destroy the communication with their other Italian
</p>
<p>states : and the first step to this end would be to
</p>
<p>remove from power in Genoa the faction of the Dqrias.
</p>
<p>Fieschi, he added, could accomplish this more easily
</p>
<p>than any other person, and he would attempt the
</p>
<p>enterprise if France would encourage his efforts, and
</p>
<p>promise not to lay violent hands on the Kepublic.

<p>Doria had many enemies in Paris. Though the
</p>
<p>THE PLOTS OF FlESCHl 99
</p>
<p>Chancellor Dii Prat was dead and the constable Mont-
</p>
<p>morency was fallen, yet the animosities awakened Ijy
</p>
<p>Doria in that court were not buried. Delfino still
</p>
<p>remembered that Doria had taken Genoa from the
</p>
<p>dominion of France and he meditated veno-eance.
</p>
<p>O
</p>
<p>The count of San Polo had not forgotten that
</p>
<p>Andrea caused his defeat and captivity at the battle of
</p>
<p>Landriano, by informing the Spaniards of the difHculties
</p>
<p>he was encountering in his retreat. Cardinal Tournon
</p>
<p>was unable to pardon Doria for throwing many
</p>
<p>obstacles in his way when he went to Rome to attend
</p>
<p>the conclave assembled to elect a successor to Clement
</p>
<p>VIII. Admiral Annebaut hoped to command the army
</p>
<p>to be sent for the conquest of Lombardy as soon as the
</p>
<p>revolution should break out in Genoa.
</p>
<p>Thus all the ministers, actuated at once by personal
</p>
<p>and political motives, favoured the plans of Fieschi.
</p>
<p>Gonzaga was welcomed with delight and obtained a
</p>
<p>solemn promise that the crown of France would
</p>
<p>renounce all pretensions to the government of Genoa.
</p>
<p>He was also empowered to make use of the French
</p>
<p>troops in Piedmont in garrison at Turin, Moncalieri,
</p>
<p>Savigliano and Pinerolo ; and to select in the port of
</p>
<p>Toulon such ships as might be adapted to serve the
</p>
<p>purposes of Fieschi.
</p>
<p>This negotiation, securing the cooperation of France
</p>
<p>without compromising the independence of the
</p>
<p>country, is highly creditable to Gianluigi and shows

<p>the keenness of his political vision which forecast all

<p>Perhaps he listened too hopefully to these promises of
</p>
<p>foreign succour ; but if French diplomatists then de-
</p>
<p>ceived him, he afterwards showed that he lacked neither
</p>
<p>courage nor Avill to undertake his revolution without
</p>
<p>.their cooperation.
</p>
<p>France was at that time prodigal of flattery to Italy.
</p>
<p>She drew from us her luxury, her arts and the embel-
</p>
<p>lishments of her life ; perhaps also her vices which she
</p>
<p>repaid to us with usury. She had apparently no
</p>
<p>schemes for the overthrow of the Italians, and sincerely,
</p>
<p>though not disinterestedly, sought our emancipation
</p>
<p>from the Spanish power. We are indebted to her for
</p>
<p>restraining Caesar from destroying among us even the
</p>
<p>name of liberty ; and this explains why our Eepublics,
</p>
<p>our people and our first intellects were so friendly to
</p>
<p>France. Whatever secret designs she may have
</p>
<p>cherished, she promoted popular franchises in Italy.

<p>She encouraged agriculture and commerce, and in war
</p>
<p>for the most part abstained from pillage and carnage,

<p>similar cloth is the fable of the journey of Ottobiiono,
</p>
<p>brother of Gianluigi, to Paris, and also to Rome to ask
</p>
<p>justice for a grave injury inflicted upon him by
</p>
<p>Gianettino.
</p>
<p>In the mean while, Gianluigi lost no opportunity of
</p>
<p>making partisans. The times were propitious. The
</p>
<p>Duke of Piacenza, wishing to restrain the license of the
</p>
<p>nobles published a proclamation requiring them to
</p>
<p>reside in the city. This command offended not a few
</p>
<p>who were feudatories, but not subjects, of the duke.
</p>
<p>Among these were the Borromeo of Milan, who
</p>
<p>possessed Guardasone in the province of Parma, and
</p>
<p>the Fieschi who held Calestano. Gianluigi sent a
</p>
<p>message to the duke asking that the order might be
</p>
<p>revoked in his favour. His request was granted, and
</p>
<p>he went in person, ostensibly to thank the duke and
</p>
<p>render him homage as his feudatory, but in reality to
</p>
<p>treat for the purchase of the Farnesian galleys, a
</p>
<p>measure recommended by Pier Luca as necessary to
</p>
<p>the contemplated revolution.
</p>
<p>To conceal his true intent he wrote to the Senate, on
</p>
<p>the28th of September, 1545, that he was in Piacenza
</p>
<p>to pay homage to the duke, and that he found nuncios
</p>
<p>coming there from all the Italian provinces. He there-
</p>
<p>fore advised that the Republic should also send a re-
</p>
<p>presentative. The Senate followed his advice, and

<p>charged him with the honourable oiflce.

</p>
<p>wlio had already paid a part of the price, yet the duke,
</p>
<p>knowing the use Gianluigi intended to make of them,
</p>
<p>gave him the preference. The purchase was effected
</p>
<p>on the 23rd of November, 1545. The galleys were
</p>
<p>named the Capitana, Vittoria, Santa Caterma and
</p>
<p>Padrona, and had on board, in addition to arms and
</p>
<p>equipments, three hundred persons condemned for life,
</p>
<p>one hundred and eighty-five for various terms of years,
</p>
<p>and one hundred and eighty Turkish and other slaves.
</p>
<p>The price amounted to thirty-four thousand gold
</p>
<p>crowns, to be paid in several instalments ; one tliird
</p>
<p>on delivery of the vessels, another on Lady day, 1546,
</p>
<p>and the last one year later. The deferred payments
</p>
<p>were secured upon the feud of Calestano, with the
</p>
<p>consent of Gianluigi's brother Gerolamo, who was
</p>
<p>lord of that property.'"' The contracting parties were,
</p>
<p>on one side, Paolo Pietro Guidi, president of the ducal
</p>
<p>chamber, and Giovanni Battista Liberati, the duke's
</p>
<p>treasurer ; and the Count of Lavagna on the other.
</p>
<p>We must not omit, among the conditions of the sale,
</p>
<p>that three of the galleys were to remain for two years
</p>
<p>longer in the service of the Apostolic See, Count
</p>
<p>Fieschi receiving the Papal bonds held by Orazio Far-
</p>
<p>nese.
</p>
<p>The low price of the galleys is explained by this
</p>
<p>condition, in virtue of which they were bound to re-
</p>
<p>main in the port of Civita Vecchia, and the count was
</p>
<p>obliged to provide for the maintenance and pay of the
</p>
<p>officers and crews without deriving any advantage from

</p>
<p>Giulio Pojano, who had also commanded them under
</p>
<p>Orazio Farnese when the emperor undertook the war
</p>
<p>of Alo;iers.
</p>
<p>We are not able to decide with certainty whether,
</p>
<p>after this purchase, the count went to Eome, as some
</p>
<p>affirm. We find however that Duke Pierluigi, having
</p>
<p>proclaimed a tournament in Piacenza to take place on
</p>
<p>the 21st of February, 1546, and requested that the
</p>
<p>ladies of his feudatories should also attend, the countess
</p>
<p>Eleanora, as well as many others, complied with the
</p>
<p>invitation and was presented by her husband to the
</p>
<p>duke, who now treated Gianluigi as his equal.
</p>
<p>Duke Farnese announced another tournament for
</p>
<p>the autumn of the same year, to celebrate the marriage
</p>
<p>of Faustina Sforza with Muzio Visconti Sforza, marquis
</p>
<p>of Caravaggio. At this festival the flower of the
</p>
<p>Italian nobility was gathered together; and in the
</p>
<p>tournament of the 20th of October, 1546, Nicolo Pus-
</p>
<p>terla and Count Fieschi obtained the highest honours.
</p>
<p>It is not known what means the duke intended to
</p>
<p>employ for carrying out the contemplated revolution.
</p>
<p>Perhaps both Fieschi and Farnese were yet undecided.
</p>
<p>It is not impossible (we have strong testimony for the
</p>
<p>theory) that they waited, with the hope of enlisting on
</p>
<p>their side one who had even more audacity and
</p>
<p>strength than themselves, and who would have brought

<p>no mean forces into the alliance.

<p>104 CONSPIRACY OF OIANLUIGI FIESOHI.
</p>
<p>of Fieschi. Francesco Burlamacchi, born of a noble
</p>
<p>house in Lucca, had conceived the lofty design of re-
</p>
<p>volutionizing, under popular auspices, the Tuscan cities
</p>
<p>oppressed by Cosimo ; allying them to the still surviving
</p>
<p>republics of Lucca and Siena ; embracing in the new
</p>
<p>nation Perugia, which since 1540 had maintained itself
</p>
<p>under popular government against the Papacy ; taking
</p>
<p>away from the Apostolic See the temporal power, and
</p>
<p>restoring the church to the consecrated poverty of the
</p>
<p>Gospel.
</p>
<p>He confided in the popular discontent at domestic
</p>
<p>and foreign tyranny, and not less in the reformed doc-
</p>
<p>trines which were advocated by the most distinguished
</p>
<p>Italians, especially by those of Lucca. He proposed
</p>
<p>his scheme to his friends and sought partisans among
</p>
<p>the Florentine exiles, the faction of the Strozzi, and
</p>
<p>even among the German Lutherans who had at their
</p>
<p>head Phillip Landgrave of Hesse, and Frederick, duke
</p>
<p>of Saxony. Impatient of delay, he went in person to
</p>
<p>Venice, then the asylum of the Tuscan and Genoese
</p>
<p>exiles, and solicited their cooperation. He made an
</p>
<p>arrangement with Leone Strozzi, prior of Capua, by
</p>
<p>which the latter agreed to support the enterprize ; but
</p>
<p>Strozzi thought- it wiser to procrastinate until the re-
</p>
<p>sult of the Germanic war should be known.
</p>
<p>Burlamacchi, having been created commissary of
</p>
<p>ordnance at Montagna, resolved to undertake his daring
</p>
<p>enterprize without waiting longer for foreign aid. He

<p>intended to rouse the people to arms, mai'ch rapidly

<p>upon Pisa  whose fortress, commanded by Vincenzo
</p>
<p>THE PLOTS OF PIESCHI. 105
</p>
<p>del Poggio, would be opened to him without bloodshed
</p>
<p> to capture Florence, and thence spread the generous
</p>
<p>fire of liberty over the Peninsula.
</p>
<p>The revolution was planned with great prudence and
</p>
<p>all contingencies were amply provided for. Unfor-
</p>
<p>tunately, however, he was obliged in the exercise of
</p>
<p>his office as Confaloniere of justice to issue a proclama-
</p>
<p>tion against one Andrea Pezzini who was cognisant of
</p>
<p>the conspiracy. This person in order to gratify his
</p>
<p>malice, revealed the whole scheme to Duke Cosimo.
</p>
<p>The government of Luca, mortally terrified by the 'Pope
</p>
<p>and the emperor, arrested Burlamacchi, in August
</p>
<p>1546, and obtained from him by torture a confession
</p>
<p>of his revolutionary designs. Luca consigned him to
</p>
<p>the imperial ministers by whom he \ifas beheaded in
</p>
<p>Milan.
</p>
<p>Some confused and scattered papers which we have
</p>
<p>seen imply that there were messages and interviews
</p>
<p>between Gianluigi and Burlamacchi, and this corres-
</p>
<p>ponds with that which Adriani has written of the
</p>
<p>Lucchese revolutionist, viz : that he had formed friend-
</p>
<p>ship and made allies in every part of Em-ope. It is
</p>
<p>then very probable that he sounded Count Fieschi,
</p>
<p>whose enmity to the Spaniards was well known, as
</p>
<p>one whose great wealth and numerous dej)endents
</p>
<p>would greatly reinforce the revolution. Fieschi was
</p>
<p>often at his castle in Pontremoli and it would have been
</p>
<p>easy for the two to hold secret interviews without
</p>
<p>awakening the least suspicion. It is possible that

<p>eve of the ordination of the Cardinals, Chira, suspecting
</p>
<p>what had happened, passed a night with the pontiff
</p>
<p>and when he, drunken with lust and wine, fell into a
</p>
<p>profound slumber, she searched his papers and ascer-
</p>
<p>tained the truth of her suspicions.
</p>
<p>Being an adept in copying and reckless of conse-
</p>
<p>quences, she rewrote the list, counterfeiting the Pope's
</p>
<p>hand^\Titing, and placed the name of her brother first
</p>
<p>on the roll. On the morrow, she put on all her
</p>
<p>seducing charms and detained her paramour in his bed
</p>
<p>until messengers came to inform him that the concistory
</p>
<p>was assembled and only waited his presence. Clara
</p>
<p>had foreseen that, if he were called in haste, he would
</p>
<p>have no time to look over his papers. In fact, he
</p>
<p>entered the concistory and gave the list to the secre-
</p>
<p>taries without looking it over. His surprise was great
</p>
<p>when the name of Farnese was read out ; but he pre-
</p>
<p>ferred silence to the exposure of his senile debaucheries.

<p>to escape from prison. We shall not repeat the errors
</p>
<p>of his contemporary historians, that he united the
</p>
<p>black act to his astronomical learning, and that he thus,
</p>
<p>through intercourse with demons, learned many secrets
</p>
<p>and became skilled in political intrigues. It is enough
</p>
<p>to say that, on arriving at the pontifical tlu'one, he de-
</p>
<p>voted all his efforts to the aggrandizement of his family ;

</p>
<p>for his liastard son Pierluigi, intrigued to elevate him
</p>
<p>to the government of Parma and Piacenza, and even
</p>
<p>raised his eyes to that of MiLm.
</p>
<p>It was not then a reproach, says Segni,* that a Pope
</p>
<p>had illegitimate children and sought by every means
</p>
<p>to confer upon them wealth and dignities ; on the con-
</p>
<p>trary, the Pontiff who aspired to temporal grandeur
</p>
<p>was in repute as a man of prudence and sagacity.
</p>
<p>Paul III. intrigued for a long time with the emperor
</p>
<p>to acquire the duchy of Milan for Pierluigi, though he
</p>
<p>well knew that Charles, in occupying Lombardy, had
</p>
<p>protested that he did not wish to hold it for his own
</p>
<p>advantage but for that of Italy. In these intentions
</p>
<p>he was confirmed by the influence of the Venitians,
</p>
<p>the marquis Vasto and the king of France. The
</p>
<p>Spanish monarch had already disappointed the ambi-
</p>
<p>tion of the duke of Orleans, who aspired to the duchy,
</p>
<p>and he also refused it to Pierluigi, But the Pope,
</p>
<p>after long intrigues to overcome the scruples of the
</p>
<p>cardinals, gave his son the investiture of Parma and
</p>
<p>Piacenza, making them tributory to the church in the
</p>
<p>sum of nine thousand ducats.
</p>
<p>This act created enmity between the Farnesi and the
</p>
<p>emperor, though Paul III. had furnished the latter with
</p>
<p>men and money for his war against the Duke of
</p>
<p>Saxony, sending twelve thousand horse under the com-
</p>
<p>mand of Ottavio Farnese and Alessandro Vitelli. But

</p>
<p>disappointed hope of a principality and the league of
</p>
<p>tlie emperor with Enghmd the enemy of the Papacy,
</p>
<p>rendered Paul a bitter foe of Spain and awakened in
</p>
<p>him the ambition to crush the imperial power.
</p>
<p>Andrea Doria hated the Farnese not less cordially
</p>
<p>than Charles. He had opposed the advancement of
</p>
<p>this family for ten years, and had frustrated a proposed
</p>
<p>league between the Papal See and the empire. He had
</p>
<p>influenced Charles to refuse the duchy of Milan to
</p>
<p>Pierluigi, and subsequently to deny Ottavio, son of
</p>
<p>Pierluigi, the government of Tuscany according to a
</p>
<p>promise the emperor had made when Ottavio married
</p>
<p>his illegitimate daughter Margaret, of Austria. Doria
</p>
<p>urged against the last scheme that if the Farnese were
</p>
<p>made masters of Tuscany they would become powerful
</p>
<p>enough to lay hands on the Lombard provinces.
</p>
<p>There were still other motives for Andrea's jealousy
</p>
<p>of the power of the Farnese family. A member of the
</p>
<p>Doria house named Imperiale being reduced to extreme
</p>
<p>poverty had obtained an appointment in the army of
</p>
<p>Andrea. He distinguished himself in many actions
</p>
<p>and rose to the highest honours and wealth. But
</p>
<p>having satisfied his military ambition he became a
</p>
<p>priest, in which character he was first abbott of San
</p>
<p>Fruttuoso and afterwards, through the influence of
</p>
<p>Andrea, bishop of Sagona in Corsica. Wishing,
</p>
<p>however, to advance his worldly interests he retired
</p>
<p>into Apulia where he acquu'ed many estates, and was
</p>
<p>elevated l^y Andrea to the government of Melfi, in

</p>
<p>which he largely increased his wealth.
</p>
<p>PAUL THIRD. Ill
</p>
<p>Before liis death, remembering the kindness of Doria,
</p>
<p>he bequeathed to him all his possessions. The Papal
</p>
<p>nuncio seized upon and sequestrated the estates of the
</p>
<p>bishop, claiming that they belonged by right to the
</p>
<p>church. Andrea protested against this insult before
</p>
<p>the Papal court, but Kome, being at once a party to
</p>
<p>the cause and the judge of it, decided in its ownftivour
</p>
<p>and issued a decree despoiling the admiral of all his
</p>
<p>rights in the property of his relative. Paul III. fearing
</p>
<p>the vengeance of the admiral of the empire, deputed
</p>
<p>his nephew Alexander Farnese to offer, as a compensa-
</p>
<p>tion for the outrage, the power of nominating a successor
</p>
<p>to the bishop. Doria disdained to render a vassal's
</p>
<p>homage to a Farnese and ordered Gianettino to assail
</p>
<p>and capture the Papal galleys in the port of Genoa.
</p>
<p>This capture inflamed the wrath of the pontiff, and as
</p>
<p>an act of reprisal he arrested some Genoese who were
</p>
<p>in Rome, threatening to confiscate their goods unless
</p>
<p>his ships were immediately released. The Senate laid
</p>
<p>the matter before Andrea, who answered that Gianettino
</p>
<p>had captured the Papal vessels solely because he was
</p>
<p>stronger at sea than his adversary. Afterwards, in
</p>
<p>order to avoid complicating the Republic with his
</p>
<p>private quarrel, he released the galleys of the pontiff,
</p>
<p>after having satisfied the Farnese that he did not lack
</p>
<p>the power but the will to revenge himself.
</p>
<p>The Pope was induced by Charles V. to restore to
</p>
<p>Andrea his defrauded rights ; but the Farnese was
</p>
<p>deeply chagrined and, not being able to strike openly
</p>
<p>at the emperor's favourite, sought secret ways of venting

<p>his displeasure.

<p>112 CONSPIRACY OF GTANLUIGI FIESCHT.
</p>
<p>Private ambition, personal mortification and political
</p>
<p>views united to stimulate the pontiff to humble the
</p>
<p>emperor, expel the Spaniards and crush the Dorias.
</p>
<p>As it was obviously vain to oppose Csesar so long as
</p>
<p>Genoa, governed by the constitution of Doria, was
</p>
<p>under the Spanish influence, he naturally fell in with
</p>
<p>projects which contemplated a revolution in the
</p>
<p>Kepublic.
</p>
<p>It is certain, says a, modern writer, that Paul was
</p>
<p>skilled in mingling modern passions with the adminis-
</p>
<p>tration of his venerable office. He stood between the
</p>
<p>old world and the new, and he possessed the spirit of
</p>
<p>both ; and if the election of Clement had not deprived
</p>
<p>him of the pontificate for ten years (as he often lamen-
</p>
<p>ted) perhaps the fortunes of Italy, which were not yet
</p>
<p>desperate, might have been saved by his industry or,
</p>
<p>at least, would not have suffered total shipwreck.
</p>
<p>At that period several Fieschi families were in a
</p>
<p>flourishing state, among them that of Ettore, of the
</p>
<p>Savignone line, who had espoused Maria di Gian-
</p>
<p>Ambrogio Fieschi, From this marriage were born,
</p>
<p>Francesco, Giacomo, Nicol5, Paride, Gian-Ambrogio,
</p>
<p>Urbano and Innocenzio. Ettore having given some of
</p>
<p>his property in Rome to Giacomo and Nicolo, who as
</p>
<p>priests were stationed in that city, at the death of the
</p>
<p>first the father found it necessary to make a journey
</p>
<p>thither.
</p>
<p>Having presented himself to the Pope he was gra-
</p>
<p>ciously received and obtained the bishopric of Savonja

</p>
<p>for his second son.
</p>
<p>PAUL THIRD. 113
</p>
<p>In their conferences the Pontiff spoke of the past
</p>
<p>grandeur of the Fieschi family, of the hospitality he
</p>
<p>had received in the pahice in Viahxta in the time of
</p>
<p>Sinibaldo, and expressed surprise that none of the sons
</p>
<p>of Sinibaldo, whom he knew to be young men of spirit
</p>
<p>and ambition, had sought honours in the Papal court,
</p>
<p> honours which could not be denied to the scions of
</p>
<p>a noble house, which counted two successors of St.
</p>
<p>Peter and four hundred mitred heads in its ancestry.
</p>
<p>He also begged Ettore to inform Fieschi that he en-
</p>
<p>tertained the most flattering opinion of their merits,
</p>
<p>and should.be happy to give full proof of his esteem.
</p>
<p>On his return to Genoa, Ettore informed Gianluigi
</p>
<p>of the sentiments of Paul III. and of his nephew the
</p>
<p>cardinal towards the family, and the count resolved
</p>
<p>personally to render thanks to the Pontiff. He visited
</p>
<p>Eome, though dissuaded by Panza, in May, 1546 (as
</p>
<p>Bonfadio tells us. Some maintain that he went there
</p>
<p>at other periods, but we find no authentic evidence to
</p>
<p>support the assertion.
</p>
<p>Paul received Gianluigi in the kindest manner, and
</p>
<p>took pains to show him honour. During their conver-
</p>
<p>sations he spoke much of the ancestors of the count
</p>
<p>as having been the first citizens of Genoa. He lamen-
</p>
<p>ted that the Dorias had overshadowed the family of
</p>
<p>Fieschi. Andrea, he said, by his political tact and by
</p>
<p>refraining from assuming in name the power which he
</p>
<p>possessed in reality, had rendered his vast influence
</p>
<p>less obnoxious to his countrymen, but that Gianettino
</p>
<p>would not imitate this temperate policy nor long delay

<p>to place his yoke on the Genoese. Count Fiesehi, he
</p>
<p>added, would be the first one humbled, as being the
</p>
<p>most dangerous enemy to the empire. He intimated
</p>
<p>that if Gianluigi had the spirit to oppose the Doria
</p>
<p>ambition, the support of the Holy See would not be
</p>
<p>wanting in the hour of trial.
</p>
<p>He gave a more positive proof of his wdllingness to
</p>
<p>act by proposing that the count should immediately
</p>
<p>take command of the three galleys included in the
</p>
<p>Farnese purchase, which still remained in the service
</p>
<p>of the papal government, in order, said he (and he
</p>
<p>smiled cunningly), that they may not again be captured
</p>
<p>by Doria. This conversation, so familiar and hopeful,
</p>
<p>greatly encouraged Gianluigi and induced him to put
</p>
<p>his designs into immediate execution.
</p>
<p>An event occurred during this visit to Eome which
</p>
<p>nearly overthrew all these revolutionary schemes. Car-
</p>
<p>dinal Agostino Trivulzio, who, as protector of France,
</p>
<p>lost no occasion for promoting the policy of that na-
</p>
<p>tion, established relations of intimacy with Gianluigi,
</p>
<p>and undertook to demonstrate that the difficulties of
</p>
<p>his enterprise were such as to render it necessary to
</p>
<p>concede to France the government of Genoa. France,
</p>
<p>he said, would place the count at the head of the local
</p>
<p>administration, and would give him the command of
</p>
<p>six galleys, equipped on a war footing and maintained
</p>
<p>at the expense of the crown, of which he could make
</p>
<p>such use as seemed best. France would also station a
</p>
<p>heavy body of troops at Montobbio, to prevent the

<p>of ten thousand crowns.
</p>
<p>These new propositions came through Prince Giano
</p>
<p>Caracciolo, governor-general of Piedmont^ and had his
</p>
<p>seal to their authenticity. They entirely destroyed the
</p>
<p>previous arrangements made by Gagnino Gonzaga, and
</p>
<p>contemplated the subjection of the Eepublic to a for-
</p>
<p>eign power. They did not please Gianluigi, who desired
</p>
<p>to enlarge the liberties of his country, not to change
</p>
<p>the masters of the Eepublic.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he asked time for consideration, and
</p>
<p>without making further steps in his design he returned
</p>
<p>to Genoa. Pondering over the difficulties of his un-
</p>
<p>dertaking and the new claims of France, he would
</p>
<p>probably have relinquished the enterprise, if Gianettino,
</p>
<p>who, in the tone of one who held the dominion of the
</p>
<p>waves, complained of the purchase of the Farnese
</p>
<p>galleys, had not used such bitter and imperious threats
</p>
<p>as to inflame anew the resentment of the count. The
</p>
<p>success and malevolence of Gianettino, to whom as to
</p>

</p>
<p>116 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGI FIESCHI,
</p>
<p>Gianluigi was delighted beyond measure at this
</p>
<p>favourable turn of affairs. He subscribed the stipula-
</p>
<p>tions at once and sent back the messenger with warm
</p>
<p>thanks for the generosity of the French monarch.
</p>
<p>Francis really desired above everything to recover his
</p>
<p>lost dominion over Liguria, but he was persuaded to
</p>
<p>defer that ambition to a more favourable combination
</p>
<p>of circumstances.
</p>
<p>Fieschi now exposed his plans (in this point all the
</p>
<p>historians agree and are confirmed by the manuscripts
</p>
<p>we have seen) to three of his most devoted friends,
</p>
<p>Eaffaele Sacco, Vincenzo Calcagno and Giovanni Bat-
</p>
<p>tista Verrina. He submitted to them the question
</p>
<p>whether he should attempt a revolution relying solely on
</p>
<p>his own forces, or undertake it in alliance with France.
</p>
<p>Sacco was born of not obscure lineage in Savona,
</p>
<p>beins^ descended from a knio;ht of Malta and entitled
</p>
<p>to the annual gift of a pnschal lamb. AVe find that a
</p>
<p>branch of the Sacoo family living in Genoa had been
</p>
<p>united to the family of Venti, and not long after, in
</p>
<p>1363, to that of the Franchi. Sacco was auditor and
</p>
<p>judge in the feuds of the count and knew intimately
</p>
<p>the feelings of his master. He advised that the French
</p>
<p>arms be accepted  an opinion partly explained by his
</p>
<p>being of Savona. Your forces, said he, are too weak
</p>
<p>to oppose those of Doria and the emperor ; and though
</p>
<p>it may be easy to capture the city by a coup de main,
</p>
<p>it will be impossible to hold it unless you are promptly
</p>
<p>reenforced by a good body of troops.

<p>Vincenzo Calcagno was beloved by Gianluigi for
</p>
<p>PAUL THIRD. 117
</p>
<p>long and faithful services. After the Warmest protes-
</p>
<p>tations of his fidelity and obedience as a vassal, he
</p>
<p>spoke at length of the evils of civil war and foreign inter-
</p>
<p>vention which must follow from an attempt to change
</p>
<p>the government. He enlarged on the difficulties of the
</p>
<p>enterprise. Doria had twenty galleys. The sea coast
</p>
<p>and nobility were liis. Foreign rule was hateful to the
</p>
<p>Genoese, but above all that of France. Francis occu-
</p>
<p>pied by home politics, embarrassed in Lombardy and
</p>
<p>in Naples, would not bestow a thought on Genoa if he
</p>
<p>did not hope to acquire his lost power over her. The
</p>
<p>nobility are in power and hate revolution, and even the
</p>
<p>plebeians would oppose a new order of things unless
</p>
<p>proposed by a noble. The people are unwilling to
</p>
<p>obey men without high rank, accustomed not to yield
</p>
<p>even to the nobles without desperate necessity,  and,
</p>
<p>stimulated by recent events, they would demand full
</p>
<p>control of the government. But granted that the re-
</p>
<p>volution may succeed, no sooner would the new state
</p>
<p>be created than the crests of Adorni and Fregoso
</p>
<p>would be seen in the foreground.
</p>
<p>These powerful families, still beloved by the people,
</p>
<p>would never consent to submit the government to the
</p>
<p>control of a species of prince  a thing they have for
</p>
<p>centuries resisted with their blood  so that the efforts
</p>
<p>of the count will not enhance his personal grandeur,
</p>
<p>but only promote the interests of rival families ; the
</p>
<p>name of Fieschi will become a reproach, distrusted
</p>
<p>by the nobles, despised by the people and hated by

<p>Calcagno would have gone on to dissuade tlie count
</p>
<p>from the whole scheme if the impetuous Verrina had
</p>
<p>not interrupted him with impatience and anger.
</p>
<p>The family of Verrina was originally of Voltri, and
</p>
<p>came into the city in 1475. Stefano Verrina had en-
</p>
<p>rolled himself as a noble attached to the company or
</p>
<p>Alhei-go of the Franchi. John Baptist Verrina di
</p>
<p>Vinccnzo, a most honourable citizen, was then living in
</p>
<p>Carignano, though born near the church of San Siro,
</p>
<p>not far from the count, and was managing his affairs,
</p>
<p>Party spidt and private animosities rendered him a
</p>
<p>violent enemy of the old nobles; and he could not
</p>
<p>digest it that those who had long been excluded from
</p>
<p>public offices should, through the reforms of Doria,
</p>
<p>be invested with the entire control of affairs. He had
</p>
<p>once been rich, but his excessive generosity had wasted
</p>
<p>his wealth, and he was now supporting the dechning
</p>
<p>fortunes of his family upon the liberality of Fieschi.
</p>
<p>His intellect was of a high order, his courage that of a
</p>
<p>hero ; his spirit was high and venturous, ever intent
</p>
<p>on the loftiest designs. He had assumed for a motto 
</p>
<p>The world belongs to him who will take it.
</p>
<p>Verrina demonstrated with great force and eloquence
</p>
<p>that too much had already been done to leave any pre-
</p>
<p>text for abandoning the enterprise  that retreat was
</p>
<p>more dangerous than the battle.
</p>
<p>Kevolutionary schemes ought to be executed as soon
</p>
<p>as formed. The plans of Fieschi had reached such a
</p>
<p>stage that the only thing left was to bring them to

</p>

</p>
<p>PAUL THIRD. 119
</p>
<p>struggle. He argued that the enterprise was not diffi-
</p>
<p>cult ; the Doria ships were idle and their crews scat-
</p>
<p>tered along the coasts, the garrison of the city was
</p>
<p>reduced to only two hundred and fifty infantry, many
</p>
<p>of whom were vassals of the count. The people
</p>
<p>wanted a change of government ; the Senate was
</p>
<p>sleeping in imaginary security. It was folly to pro-
</p>
<p>crastinate the horn' for delivering the country from the
</p>
<p>ambition of Gianettino, when everything was smiling
</p>
<p>upon their hopes and nothing but their own hesitation
</p>
<p>foreboded danger.
</p>
<p>He said that it was useless to ask the aid of the
</p>
<p>French, who had been humiliated by the captivity of
</p>
<p>their king and were getting the worse in their struggle
</p>
<p>with Charles V., master of all Germany. The very
</p>
<p>example of Doria proved the nature of French sym-
</p>
<p>pathy for Italy. Doria had learned too well that
</p>
<p>Francis desired to reduce the importance of Genoa by
</p>
<p>removing Savona from her jurisdiction, and making the
</p>
<p>latter the capital of Liguria. Tlie count, said he, has
</p>
<p>the means of full success. Eaise the cry of popular
</p>
<p>liberty, and thousands of swords will be uplifted for
</p>
<p>the cause. Let Gianluigi dare to proclaim liberty to
</p>
<p>these oppressed multitudes. Let him dare to announce
</p>
<p>himself as their liberator. When Caesar fell, Pompey
</p>
<p>was not declared a rebel, but the saviour of Kome.
</p>
<p>Let our master imitate the high example now, when

<p>120 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGI FIESCHI.
</p>
<p>The arcfunients of Verrina overcame the doubts of
</p>
<p>the count, and he resolved to proceed with tl\e general
</p>
<p>plan then worked out. He instructed Foderato to
</p>
<p>communicate to Trivulzio his desire that the original
</p>
<p>compact with' Gonzaga be observed in every particular.
</p>
<p>In the meantime he came into closer relations with
</p>
<p>Paul III., by nfeans of the Pontiff's nephew the car-
</p>
<p>dinal ; and to complete all his preparations he resolved
</p>
<p>to go to Piacenza and confer with the duke.
</p>
<p>It is of importance to observe that Fieschi, following
</p>
<p>the counsels of Verrina, declined the proffer of French
</p>
<p>troops and galleys. Some paint this friend of the
</p>
<p>count as a species of demon. They tell us that he
</p>
<p>Avished to murder the nobility and appropriate their
</p>
<p>goods, because he was overwhelmed with debts, and to
</p>
<p>raise the count to the office of Doge, or rather to make
</p>
<p>him the tyrant of Genoa. In truth, we find these
</p>
<p>fables in all the historians, even in the least passionate
</p>
<p>and partisan, who seem to have taken no pains to sift
</p>
<p>testimony, but to have accepted the Spanish slanders
</p>
<p>without question.
</p>
<p>In a city like Genoa, but recently deprived of the
</p>
<p>popular liberty which she had enjoyed for centuries,
</p>
<p>the idea of destroying free institutions could not have
</p>
<p>entered the brain of a sane politician. Neither Verrina
</p>
<p>nor the count were so short-sighted as to believe that
</p>
<p>an enterprise which the emperor, with the support of
</p>
<p>all the nobles, had found impossible could be easily
</p>
<p>executed by them. The ancient story is repeated in
</p>
<p>our times. The victors have ^vritten the history of the

</p>
<p>This seems to us the place to describe an atrocious
</p>
<p>deed, which shows, on the one hand, the great affec-
</p>
<p>tion of the count for the members of his family ; and,
</p>
<p>on the other, how deeply he felt injuries and how
</p>
<p>terribly he avenged them. The tragedy of which we
</p>
<p>now speak still lives in tradition on the spot where it
</p>
<p>was enacted. We have drawn the history of it from
</p>
<p>old documents, which agree in general with the account
</p>
<p>written by Bandello, who received it from the lips of
</p>
<p>Catando d'Arimini, an intimate friend of Gianluigi.'"^
</p>
<p>We have already stated that Sinibaldo had, besides
</p>
<p>his legitimate children, a son named Cornelio and a
</p>
<p>daughter named Claudia. This daughter was beautiful
</p>
<p>and attractive in person and manners. While yet very
</p>
<p>young she was married to Simone Ravaschiero di
</p>
<p>Manfredi. He was a rich and influential citizen of
</p>
<p>Chiavari and desired a family alliance with the Fieschi,
</p>
<p>in order to secure their assistance against count Agos-
</p>
<p>tino Lando, with whom he was contesting the jurisdic-
</p>
<p>tion of a castle in the duchy of Piacenza. The
</p>
<p>marriage was celebrated with the splendour to which
</p>
<p>the Fieschi were habituated, and Claudia took up her
</p>
<p>residence in Chiavari, acquiring through the purity of
</p>
<p>her life and the charms of her conversation the admira-
</p>
<p>tion of all who knew her. Giovanni Battista Delia
</p>
<p>Torre, one of the most high-born and wealthy citizens
</p>
<p>of the district, paid her such assiduous court that she
</p>
<p>soon perceived the object of his attentions. She

<p>hopes of her admirer. The young man, beside him-
</p>
<p>self with his foolish passion and consuming with
</p>
<p>amorous fires, studied to find some means of obtaining
</p>
<p>by stratagem that which had been denied to his love.
</p>
<p>He chose the occasion of her husband's absence in
</p>
<p>Genoa to adjust his accounts with Gianluigi, and, by
</p>
<p>bribing a servant, penetrated into the chamber of
</p>
<p>Claudia and concealed himself under her bed.
</p>
<p>The lady was accustomed, when her husband was
</p>
<p>absent, to require her maid before she retired to rest to
</p>
<p>examine all the corners and hiding-places of her apart-
</p>
<p>ments ; and on that evening, as if presaging the
</p>
<p>danger which was near, ordered the servant to make
</p>
<p>careful search whether any one was there concealed.
</p>
<p>The maid looked under the bed, and, seeing a man
</p>
<p>hidden there, uttered a loud cry, at which Claudia
</p>
<p>leaped from her couch and ran into her father-in-law's
</p>
<p>room. The old man roused his servants, armed them
</p>
<p>and went to take vengeance on the violater of his
</p>
<p>domestic dominions. But Delia Torre, finding his
</p>
<p>plot had failed, leaped from a window of consider-
</p>
<p>able height, and, falling, received severe bruises and
</p>
<p>wounds. Nor would he have escaped, if some neigh-
</p>
<p>bours who heard the noise of his fall had not come to
</p>
<p>his relief and saved him from the fury of Manfredi,
</p>
<p>by bearing him away to the house of one of them.
</p>
<p>On the followino; mornino; Manfredi sent swift mes-
</p>

<p>concealed his anger and waited to know the nature of
</p>
<p>PAUL THIRD. 123
</p>
<p>Delia Torre's wounds and what hope there might be
</p>
<p>of his recovery. Learning that, though disfigured for
</p>
<p>life, he would recover from the effects of the fall, he
</p>
<p>called to him his brother Cornelio and his cousin
</p>
<p>Simone and said to them : " You know, Cornelio, the
</p>
<p>outrage which Delia Torre has committed against our
</p>
<p>sister Claudia, and I believe that if you have the
</p>
<p>spirit which belongs to your blood you will arrange
</p>
<p>with Simone to take such vengeance as the case requires.
</p>
<p>I have prepared two galleys, manned by twenty well-
</p>
<p>armed and brave men each. Set sail. Three hours
</p>
<p>before dawn you will be in Chiavari. There, without
</p>
<p>any delay, you will assail the house of Delia Torre, and
</p>
<p>if you tear him into a thousand pieces you will give
</p>
<p>him that reward which his crime merits. Having
</p>
<p>accomplished your purpose, take refuge in my castles
</p>
<p>which are near there and of which I give you the
</p>
<p>countersigns. Afterwards leave me to provide for
</p>
<p>everything. Unless you discharge this duty, you,
</p>
<p>Cornelio, will never come into my presence lest I kill
</p>
<p>you with my own hands ; and you, Simone, will be no
</p>
<p>longer kinsman nor friend of mine."
</p>
<p>The two promised to execute his commands, and
</p>
<p>setting sail, they arrived at Chiavari at the hour
</p>
<p>appointed. Having landed, three of them went to the
</p>
<p>gates of the town and asked the guardian to admit

<p>them. Once within, the three threw out the draw-

<p>In monarchical states great families usually derive their

</p>
<p>shadows them all ; but in cities ruled by the people,
</p>
<p>every house has its peculiar position and character.
</p>
<p>In Genoa, families had features and qualities which had
</p>
<p>characterized them and given them a distinct history
</p>
<p>for centuries. The Adorni and Fregosi always loved
</p>
<p>authority ; the Durazzi were distinguished for muni-

<p>126 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGI FIESOHT.
</p>
<p>liberty to the Florentines and Luchesi. We find in
</p>
<p>the long history of their political power in Genoa that
</p>
<p>the Fieschi never struggled for supreme position as did
</p>
<p>the Adorni, Fregosi, Spinola, and Doria. Carlo Fieschi,
</p>
<p>as the chief of the Guelphs, was, in 1318, placed at
</p>
<p>the head of the government, with Gasparo Grimaldi
</p>
<p>for colleague, but he never attempted any legislative
</p>
<p>or constitutional charges for the sake of remaining in
</p>
<p>office. Bonfadio himself, though their enemy, declares
</p>
<p>that, though the Fieschi surpassed in power all other
</p>
<p>families, they never laid hands on popular rights.*
</p>
<p>They were in Genoa what the Capponi were in Florence.
</p>
<p>This reputation of the counts of Lavagna rendered
</p>
<p>it easy for Gianluigi to obtain followers. To cover his
</p>
<p>true designs, he made no change in his manners or life,
</p>
<p>carried an open and jovial countenance, and studied
</p>
<p>more than ever to promote domestic tranquihty. His
</p>
<p>palace was open to all ; he was generous with his friends,
</p>
<p>affable and courteous to every one. He courted the
</p>
<p>rich with flattery and blandishments, the poor with
</p>
<p>gifts. His table, spread with regal profusion, was free;
</p>
<p>and he seemed to have no other cares besides races, the
</p>
<p>chase and the dance.
</p>
<p>He cultivated friendship with the old nobles, but had
</p>
<p>greater intimacy with the new. The Dorias did not
</p>
<p>complain of the count's relations "s^dth the new nobility;
</p>
<p>for, though his house was old and illustrious, its tradi-
</p>
<p>tions were Guelph, and the new patricians and the
</p>
<p>leading popular families belonged to that party. In his

<p>intercourse with these persons, on whom he relied for

<p>assistance, he spoke sneeringiy of the reforms of 1528,
</p>
<p>which had advanced the Portico of San Luca to the
</p>
<p>highest power, created deep-rooted antipathies, and
</p>
<p>weakened the Kepublic. Sometimes he showed a pro-
</p>
<p>found passion, and his broken and threatening tone
</p>
<p>conveyed a meaning beyond the import of his words.
</p>
<p>Having won the favour of the rich and distinguished
</p>
<p>popular families, he cultivated the love of the plebeians.
</p>
<p>In this, his pleasant and familiar manner secured him
</p>
<p>great success. He treated them as his equals, and, the

</p>
<p>ciations as a means of perfecting their products and as
</p>
<p>a security against fraud. The historian of our manu-
</p>
<p>factures wouki tell us that in Genoa, before 1432, the
</p>
<p>trade of silk-weaving had its capitudini, or officers,
</p>
<p>consisting of two consuls and six councillors, who in-
</p>
<p>spected the quality of the fabrics, provided for their
</p>
<p>sale, took charge of the profits and decided upon the
</p>
<p>complaints of the operatives. The government issued
</p>
<p>many proclamations and made numerous laws to pro-
</p>
<p>mote the woollen trade ; among which those of Doge
</p>
<p>Pietro Fregoso are remarkable. He forbade the opera-
</p>
<p>tives, who lived in the quarter still called Borgo del
</p>
<p>Lanieri, to leave the walls of the city, or carry else-
</p>
<p>where their tools and skill, under penalty of confiscation
</p>
<p>of goods and other pains. Some illustrious men were
</p>
<p>enrolled and matriculated in the art of silk, among them
</p>
<p>Doge Paolo da Novi ; and Gianettino Doria himself,
</p>
<p>when his father Tomaso fell into poverty, spent his
</p>
<p>youth among the silk- weavers of our city. The silk
</p>
<p>operatives venerated the Volto Santo of San Cipriano,
</p>
<p>a circumstance which explains the extraordinary num-
</p>
<p>ber of these images which are to be found in Genoa
</p>
<p>and along the eastern Eiviera.
</p>
<p>Not less prosperous than the silk manufactures were

<p>the corders and beaters of wool, also united into asso-

<p>Our armies were nothing more than associations. Such

<p>with the people to open the path to naval and military

<p>authority.
</p>
<p>The mark of these Guelpli institutions on the
</p>
<p>people of Genoa was deep and enduring. The Genoese
</p>
<p>of our day are living proof of their lasting influence.
</p>
<p>Labour and banking produced immense wealth. The
</p>
<p>Genoese became the bankers of Europe. In the year
</p>
<p>1200 they drew the first bill of exchange.'" It was
</p>
<p>drawn on Palermo. They diffused the Arabic system
</p>
<p>of notation. In 1148 they created, for the conquest
</p>
<p>of Tortosa, the first public debts which they afterwards
</p>
<p>consolidated, appropriating the city and port customs
</p>
<p>to pay the interest. They founded the Bank of St.
</p>
<p>George, on whose model those of England and Holland
</p>
<p>were constructed, and they planted colonies everywhere.
</p>
<p>Along the inhospitable coasts of the Casj)ian and Aral,

<p>in Turchestan and Thibet, the pilgrim was safe in

</p>
<p>We return from this digression to the thread of our
</p>
<p>narrative. The long wars had lessened the gains of
</p>
<p>our trades-people ; even the silk operatives were by
</p>
<p>the want of markets reduced to extremities. In that
</p>
<p>year, too, food was dear throughout Italy; and the

<p>merchants who held grain kept it back from sale in

</p>
<p>sums of money with a request to keep secret the name
</p>
<p>of the iipnor, and to inform him whenever they were
</p>
<p>again in urgent need.
</p>
<p>He frequently requested the artisans and mechanics
</p>
<p>who were natives of his lands (they were more than
</p>
<p>two hundred) to come to him in Vialata, where he
</p>
<p>opened to them his granaries, and otherwise succoured
</p>
<p>them. By such acts of generosity he acquired the
</p>
<p>favour of the people, who were ready, as a proverb has
</p>
<p>it, "to carry water for him in their ears," and to defend
</p>
<p>his person at their own peril.
</p>
<p>Having by such practices obtained the sympathy of
</p>
<p>the new nobles and the humble classes who lived by
</p>
<p>their daily labour, the count began to provide the
</p>
<p>arms and soldiers which he should need, and, with
</p>
<p>great tact, availed himself in the exigency of the
</p>
<p>discords among the neighbouring governments.
</p>
<p>Pierluigi Farnese, after having obtained from Paul
</p>
<p>ni. the investiture of Parma and Piacenza, soon found
</p>
<p>that he had not sufficient forces to maintain his power
</p>
<p>in these provinces. Gerolamo Pallavicini, marquis of
</p>
<p>Cortemaggiore, and others of that family to whom the
</p>
<p>duke had prohibited the trade in siilt, raised an armed
</p>
<p>rebellion. The Rossi, Sanseverino, Pusterla of Milan,
</p>
<p>and other feudatories, were supporting the insurrection.
</p>
<p>It was also encouraged by Giovanni del Verme, lord of
</p>
<p>the Romagna, a personal enemy of the duke, and by

</p>
<p>deprived the divine architect of his reward.
</p>
<p>The duke collected an army, and, as soon as he felt
</p>
<p>able to contest the field, demanded from some of his
</p>
<p>enemies the restitution of his dominions in their pos-
</p>
<p>session, claiming that these lands and feuds had been
</p>
<p>ceded to them by his predecessors to the prejudice of
</p>
<p>the ducal rights. The Pallavicini, who were particu-
</p>
<p>larly included in this demand, made such preparations
</p>
<p>as were possible to secure their own rights and repel
</p>
<p>all the duke's attempts at aggression.
</p>
<p>The estates of the Pallavicini and Fieschi were
</p>
<p>separated only by a little stream ; and the count seeing
</p>
<p>a war cloud on the horizon, so near to his own fields,
</p>
<p>visited his feuds in the summer of 1546, under pretence
</p>
<p>of watching over his property. He spent some time
</p>
<p>at Lavagna, Montobbio, and Pontremoli. Here he
</p>
<p>collected his dependents, formed them into companies,
</p>
<p>and held musters and reviews. He would have gone
</p>
<p>farther, if the emperor, fearing that the Pallavicini
</p>
<p>dispute with Pierluigi would excite a general Italian
</p>
<p>war, and so distract his attention from his campaign
</p>
<p>against the Smacalda league in Germany, had not sent
</p>
<p>peremptory orders to Don Ferrante Gonzaga, who had
</p>
<p>succeeded to Marquis Vasto in the government of

<p>Milan, to pacify the quarrel, threatening the whole
</p>
<p>weight of the imperial displeasure against any who
</p>
<p>should refuse his mediation.

<p>with Coesar, and Count Fiesclii was chosen by Farnese
</p>
<p>as arbiter of the rival claims. These two  Farnese
</p>
<p>and Fieschi  had been on intimate terms some years
</p>
<p>before, at the time when the former came to Genoa,
</p>
<p>(1542), in company with Annibal Caro and AppoUonio
</p>
<p>Filareto, his secretaries, to pay homage to the emperor
</p>
<p>and to ask a congress in the name of the Pope  the
</p>
<p>congress which took place in Busseto.
</p>
<p>Fieschi, mindful of old ties, conducted the negocia-
</p>
<p>tion with so much dexterity that he obtained from
</p>
<p>Pallavicini more than the duke had dared to hope.
</p>
<p>A friendly and familiar correspondence always con-
</p>
<p>tinued between them, as several letters we have had in
</p>
<p>our hands prove. Among them there is one of the
</p>
<p>3rd of February, 1546  now preserved among the
</p>
<p>Farnesian papers in Parma  in which the count re-
</p>
<p>commends to the duke a master-workman, Giacomo
</p>
<p>Merello, " a maker of cannon of rare skill in his pro-
</p>
<p>fession," who had a law-suit with another master
</p>
<p>workman in Parma. In these letters the count ac-
</p>
<p>knowledges that he has received many favours from
</p>
<p>the duke.
</p>
<p>In their many interviews in Piacenza, Farnese, who
</p>
<p>knew what had been said and done at Rome, spoke
</p>
<p>freely of his hatred towards Caesar, who had openly
</p>
<p>favoured the Pallavicini, and who was a constant enemy
</p>
<p>of the advancement of the Farnese family. He avowed
</p>
<p>that he was ready to throw himself into any under-
</p>
<p>taking which should promise him revenge. The count

</p>
<p>and the Dorias, the oppressors of his country, on the
</p>
<p>plots of Gianettino, already known to him, and finally
</p>
<p>asked the assistance and support of the duke in his
</p>
<p>contemplated insurrection. It is needless to say that
</p>
<p>the duke gave liberal promises of aid in a work which
</p>
<p>would take away the influence of the Dorias, his here-
</p>
<p>ditary enemies, and doul^tless add something to his
</p>
<p>personal importance and wealth.
</p>
<p>Meantime Gianluigi, who could ill tolerate delay,
</p>
<p>enlisted in his service a large number of men, then
</p>
<p>just discharged from the ducal army, and distributed
</p>
<p>them among his most remote castles. Having returned
</p>
<p>to the city, he kept Farnese advised, by frequent mes-
</p>
<p>sengers and letters of all his movements and successes.
</p>
<p>Some of these letters are now passing through the
</p>
<p>press. In one of these, dated the l7th of April, he
</p>
<p>complains to the duke that Gianettino had given him
</p>
<p>an order from Csesar to send his fourth galley to cruise
</p>
<p>for pirates ; he speaks of plots woven for him by the
</p>
<p>young admiral, and asks the advice of Farnese.
</p>
<p>The Duke advised that his plans be hurried forward,
</p>
<p>and mentioned, as a special inducement, that Renee,
</p>
<p>of France, duchess of Ferrara, had again offered French
</p>
<p>aid through Pierluigi. But it is certain that the
</p>
<p>count made no more use of this offer than he had
</p>
<p>made of others like it.
</p>
<p>We find in ancient chronicles a statement which
</p>
<p>would be greatly to the credit of both Farnese and
</p>
<p>Fieschi. They had, according to these ^vriters, laid

<p>the foundations of a league common to all the Italian

<p>PREPARATIONS. 135
</p>
<p>princes, the object of whicli was to remove from the
</p>
<p>Peninsula every vestige of foreign power ; but histo-
</p>
<p>rical fidelity compels us to say that we have found no
</p>
<p>document which clearly proves the fact. In July, the
</p>
<p>count went to Montobbio, drilled his vassals in military
</p>
<p>exercises, and put his castles in such a state of defence
</p>
<p>as to be able to resist a long siege. He then went
</p>
<p>through, one after another, his principal feuds. It is
</p>
<p>worth our while to tou(;h in passing upon the condition
</p>
<p>of some of them at the time of which we write.
</p>
<p>Passing along the Eastern Riviera from Genoa, the
</p>
<p>count Avould first enter into Recco. It was then a
</p>
<p>large borough with three hundred and seventy-four
</p>
<p>fires, and he had built in it a superb palace called the
</p>
<p>Astrego. He drew from this feud select mariners, to
</p>
<p>man his galleys. He visited Roccatagliata and Cari-
</p>
<p>seto, castles of considerable strength. He added to their
</p>
<p>defences and supplied them with provisions. We find
</p>
<p>that he spent some time at the castle of Varzi, on the
</p>
<p>slope of Penice, formerly one of the principal fortresses
</p>
<p>of the Malaspini, near Bobbio. He remained longer
</p>
<p>still in Lavagna. This region, though not then so
</p>
<p>prosperous as it was before Frederick II., reduced it to
</p>
<p>a desert, (1245) and levelled the fourteen castles which
</p>
<p>the counts had built there, was yet a feud of consider-
</p>
<p>able importance, on account of its slate quarries.
</p>
<p>The Lavagna property included, to say truth, only
</p>
<p>a little group of a hundred and thirty-six houses, but

<p>of the Fieschi family, Cogorno and Brecanecca, form-
</p>
<p>ing in all five hundred and seventeen fires and six
</p>
<p>churches. Besides the valley of Lavagna was full of
</p>
<p>little estates and burghs, such as Torre, Vignale,
</p>
<p>Villa Fronte, Aveglio, Cortemiglio, Rimaglio, Pregio,
</p>
<p>Bausalo and Oneto. Lavagna was the heart of the
</p>
<p>Fieschi dominion. From this point it was easy to
</p>
<p>lay hands on the Lombard provinces or to draw thence
</p>
<p>men and arms. In those days the burgh of Sestri,
</p>
<p>close by, was one of the most busy points of transit,
</p>
<p>and was the oest station from which to send goods into
</p>
<p>Lombardy. Merchandize was transported from Sestri
</p>
<p>to Castiglione, and ten miles only remained to Varese,
</p>
<p>also the property of the Fieschi. It counted two
</p>
<p>hundred fires, and was prosperous with the ti'ade of
</p>
<p>Lombardy. Then, crossing the Apennines, twelve
</p>
<p>miles of travel brought the merchant to Val di Taro, a
</p>
<p>burgh of one hundred and fifty houses, which over-
</p>
<p>looked forty-two villages, subject to Count Fieschi.
</p>
<p>Having examined his resources and put his castles

<p>in a state of defence, constructing strong outer walls,

<p>for those which seemed to him to be weak, under pre-
</p>
<p>tence of " fortifying himself against the Duke of Pia-

</p>
<p>he passed over to Pontremoli.

<p>Leandro Alberti, who visited this noble and luxurious

</p>
<p>eight contiguous burghs, not to mention the valleys of
</p>
<p>Volpedo, Eosano, Zeiri, and the hamlets along the
</p>
<p>Ijanks of the Crania, which counted one thousand and
</p>
<p>eight hundred fires. Giustiniani says that the lord of
</p>
<p>Pontremoli could easily put under arms two thousand
</p>
<p>men.
</p>
<p>Gianluigi spent some time here, having conferences
</p>
<p>with Count Galeotto Mirandola, the Pusterla and Cybo,
</p>
<p>the marquises of Valdimagra, the Bentivoglio, the
</p>
<p>Strozzi and others, who were restless under the im-
</p>
<p>perial yoke ; and in these negociations he was ably
</p>
<p>seconded by Catando d' Arimini and by Giulio Pojano,
</p>
<p>to whom he had assigned the command of his galleys.
</p>
<p>The count did not return into the city until the
</p>
<p>end of autumn. Pierluigi Farnese, to remove all
</p>
<p>suspicions of the plot, wrote many letters to the
</p>
<p>Genoese government, and took great care to show his
</p>
<p>anxiety to render every service or favour in his power.
</p>
<p>The object of these letters, which may be said to con-
</p>
<p>tain little political wisdom, was much more grave and
</p>
<p>serious than their tone implied. The golden style of
</p>
<p>Caro, who dictated them, gives them a certain charm ;
</p>
<p>but their highest value lies in showing how skilfully
</p>
<p>Pierluigi and Fieschi planned and worked to elevate

<p>their friends to office under the Doria government, to

<p>get the control of public affairs out of the hands of

<p>natm-ally sought to get the lawyers on his side, as the
</p>
<p>only class who could organize and maintain the new
</p>
<p>government. By the aid of the Duke of Piacenza, he
</p>
<p>contrived to place in the principal offices of the Ruota,
</p>
<p>and even in the vicarate of the city, men who shared
</p>
<p>his own political views, and were distinguished for
</p>
<p>political sagacity and administrative ability. On the
</p>
<p>25th of May, 1486, duke Pierluigi wrote to the Doge
</p>
<p>and Governors that M. Hettore Lusiardo, a gentle-
</p>
<p>man and doctor of Piacenza and a person of great
</p>
<p>learning, desired to obtain an appointment in the
</p>
<p>Ruota of the Republic. And he adds, " I am greatly
</p>
<p>pleased to see my vassals honoured according to their
</p>
<p>merits, and I cheerfully use my influence to advance
</p>
<p>them to such positions as they desire. On this occa-
</p>
<p>sion I hope your highnesses may lend a favourable ear
</p>
<p>to my intercession on behalf of Messer Hettore, since
</p>
<p>in employing this person you will at once gratify me
</p>
<p>and secure the services of a man worthy of your es-
</p>
<p>teem, as he will show when put to the proof."
</p>
<p>In another letter of December 1 7th, he renewed the
</p>
<p>same request : " AVriting on another occasion, I have
</p>
<p>asked your favour for Messer Hettore Lusiardo, one of
</p>
<p>my Piacentine gentlemen and doctors, and a person of
</p>
<p>rare personal qualities, who desires a place in the

</p>
<p>obtain his request, I repeat my recommendations in
</p>
<p>the strongest possible terms ; and if you can give him
</p>
<p>such a place as he desires, you will not only serve a
</p>
<p>person worthy of your confidence and the favour he
</p>
<p>asks, but also do me a great pleasure."
</p>
<p>In another letter of the 24th of November, we
</p>
<p>read : " M. Bernardo Alberghetti da Rimini, at whose
</p>
<p>request I write, is a doctor in law of much learning,
</p>
<p>long practice, and strict integrity  qualities which I
</p>
<p>know him to possess, both from the reports of others
</p>
<p>and from my personal experience, having employed
</p>
<p>him for many months. He would still be in my ser-
</p>
<p>vice but that I have no employment of moment for
</p>
<p>him, and he deserves something better than a subor-
</p>
<p>dinate position. He wishes to enter into the Ruota of
</p>
<p>your most noble city as a means of advancement, and
</p>
<p>hopes that my recommendation may have some value
</p>
<p>with your Excellencies. I esteem him to be, as I have
</p>
<p>said, a person of most excellent qualifications, and I
</p>
<p>doubt not I shall have well served your interests in
</p>
<p>sending him to you, and I therefore the more boldly
</p>
<p>pray you for love of me to give him your approval."
</p>
<p>In the same year the official term of the vicar of
</p>
<p>the city expired, and the office was of such importance
</p>
<p>that the conspirators exerted themselves to fill it with
</p>
<p>a person entirely devoted to their interests. On the
</p>
<p>13th of September, Farnese wrote: "When Count
</p>
<p>Fieschi was last in Piacenza, I warmly recommended
</p>
<p>to him Mr. Camillo Villa, a Piacentine doctor in law,

<p>and urged him to ask from your Excellencies in my
</p>
<p>140 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGI FIESCHI.
</p>
<p>name the office of vicar in your city for this person.
</p>
<p>Though I am certain that the count would not fail in
</p>
<p>doing me this service, and believe that I may rely
</p>
<p>much upon your courtesy to me, and though I have
</p>
<p>recently by letter renewed my request to the count, yet
</p>
<p>I deem it not discourteous, as the time for filling this
</p>
<p>post draws near, to recommend Mr. Camillo directly
</p>
<p>to your excellencies. Should you grant my request,
</p>
<p>you will both secure to your city an ofiicer who will
</p>
<p>always serve you well and do me a personal kindness."
</p>
<p>It is hardly necessary to say that Farnese obtained
</p>
<p>from the Senate all these appointments. Secret as
</p>
<p>were these intrigues, they did not escape the acute
</p>
<p>eyes of Panza, who inferred that the count was engaged
</p>
<p>in some conspiracy. He therefore took opportunities
</p>
<p>for watching his movements and his manners; and
</p>
<p>finding that the count withdrew from his former fami-
</p>
<p>liarity with his old tutor, he was led by his affection to
</p>
<p>admonish him of the dangers before him. But Gian-
</p>
<p>luigi broke off" his reproofs with ill-concealed impatience
</p>
<p>and answered him with the words of Cato : " If I
</p>
<p>believed that the shirt I wear knew the secrets of my
</p>
<p>heart, I would tear it off" and give it to the flames."
</p>
<p>Then checking his impetuous speech, he added that he
</p>
<p>would do nothing that should not be worthy of his
</p>
<p>own fame and that of his ancestry.
</p>
<p>Panza was not the only person to suspect the count
</p>
<p>of some conspiracy against the power of Caesar. John
</p>
<p>Vega, ambassador of Spain at Rome, conceived doubts
</p>
<p>of his fidelity, and set Ferrante Gonzaga to watch his

</p>
<p>Gonzaga sent to Prince Andrea his secretary, Maone,
</p>
<p>with the letters of Vega and other documents which
</p>
<p>referred to a conspiracy, believed to be forming by
</p>
<p>Gianliiigi.
</p>
<p>Andrea rejected the tale as the work of some malig-
</p>
<p>nant slanderers, and replied that he knew Fieschi was
</p>
<p>not a man to conspire against the empire.
</p>
<p>Though the purchase of the pontifical galleys was
</p>
<p>a sharp thorn in the side of Gianettino, who aspired to
</p>
<p>an exclusive dominion of the seas, yet it was not an
</p>
<p>act sufficiently singular to awaken the suspicions of
</p>
<p>the Dorias.
</p>
<p>The most wealthy families were accustomed to arm
</p>
<p>galleys ; and the Sauli had negociated for the purchase
</p>
<p>of these same triremes, intending to use them in their
</p>
<p>maritime enterprises.
</p>
<p>The behaviour of Fieschi contributed still more to
</p>
<p>remove from the minds of Gianettino and the prince
</p>
<p>every shadow of suspicion. He frequently visited
</p>
<p>Andrea and congratulated him that, though more than
</p>
<p>eighty years of age, he enjoyed vigorous health; and
</p>
<p>he was so affectionate and obsequious to Gianettino
</p>
<p>that the young admiral tried to obtain for him a suit-
</p>
<p>able rank in the imperial army. It should not be for-
</p>
<p>gotten, however, that one motive of Gianettino was, to
</p>
<p>remove Fieschi from Genoa, as the only one likely to
</p>
<p>make an effective opposition in his personal ambition.
</p>
<p>It is certain that from the time Vega declared Giaiiluigi
</p>
<p>to be engaged in machinations against the empire,

<p>Gianettino conspired to remove from his path the only

</p>
<p>person who could be an obstacle to his own advance-
</p>
<p>ment. He only awaited Andrea's death to put off the
</p>
<p>slight mask which he had hitherto worn ; and in ex-
</p>
<p>pectation of that event he had entrusted to Captain
</p>
<p>Lercaro the business of assassinating the count. This
</p>
<p>was proved by letters of Gianettino which fell into the
</p>
<p>hands of Fieschi, and were by him shown to many
</p>
<p>persons ; though the writers in the interest of the
</p>
<p>empire asserted that these documents had been forged
</p>
<p>by Gianluigi.
</p>
<p>About this time a messenger in the confidence of
</p>
<p>Caesar brought word to the count that Andrea's solici-
</p>
<p>tations on behalf of his nephew were about to be
</p>
<p>successful, and that Gianettino would soon be invested
</p>
<p>with absolute power, on the same conditions as those
</p>
<p>by which Casimo II. had ten years before been raised
</p>
<p>to the government of Florence. This report, whether
</p>
<p>true or false, was circulated among the friends of the
</p>
<p>count, and doubly inflamed their resentment. They
</p>
<p>resolved, in their indignation, not to procrastinate
</p>
<p>longer the deliverance of the Kepublic, and to strike
</p>
<p>down with one blow the ambitious youth who was
</p>
<p>conspiring for supreme power.
</p>
<p>The count's first step was to recall from Civita-
</p>
<p>Vecchia the fourth galley under the command of Gia-
</p>
<p>cobbe Conte, on pretence of arming it as a privateer,
</p>
<p>and sending it to cruise against the Barbary commerce
</p>
<p>in the east. He had two other ships ready to sail in
</p>
<p>neighbouring ports. With these vessels he was able

</p>
<p>troops concealed in his castles. He placed some of
</p>
<p>tliem on board his triremes ; others were concealed in
</p>
<p>his own house and those of his fellow-conspirators.
</p>
<p>Verrina was the soul of every movement. He knew
</p>
<p>all the arts of ingratiating himself with the plebeians,
</p>
<p>and winning their sympathies to the cause of his
</p>
<p>master. He began to allude in guarded phrases to the
</p>
<p>necessity of a revolution in the interest of popular
</p>
<p>government ; and at the same time contrived to have
</p>
<p>many vassals of the count enrolled in the permanent
</p>
<p>militia of the Eepublic. Many artisans and mechanics
</p>
<p>to whom he gave presents, promised him the service of
</p>
<p>their arms to rescue by force a castle of the count
</p>
<p>from some Florentine merchants, who, he said, had
</p>
<p>seized it for debts. He was a man capable of invent-
</p>
<p>ing traps and lures for all sorts of birds, and he enrolled
</p>
<p>no one, whom he believed fitted for the work of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy, until he had sounded the note best
</p>
<p>adapted to charm his recruit.
</p>
<p>Calcagno, though he had dissuaded the count from
</p>
<p>drawing the sword, was so overcome by his love for his
</p>
<p>young master, that he was the most ardent worker in
</p>
<p>the conspiracy. He was assigned the office of provid-
</p>
<p>ing arms and provisions for the troops gradually being
</p>
<p>collected and introduced into the city. Sacco was
</p>
<p>appointed to maintain order and discipline among these
</p>
<p>soldiers. Ottobuono, brother of Gianluigi, was sent to

<p>the court of France to secure the sympathy of the

</p>
<p>144 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGI FIESOHI.
</p>
<p>The Republic was at this moment without a Doge,
</p>
<p>Giovanni Battista di Fornari having retired from the
</p>
<p>magistracy. The galleys were idle and without^ crews,
</p>
<p>because the season was unpropitious for navigation.
</p>
<p>There were few of the permanent militia in the city,
</p>
<p>and these for the most part were devoted to Gianluigi.
</p>
<p>Giulio Cybo and other marquises of Valdimagra, had a
</p>
<p>considerable force ready to break into the city at the
</p>
<p>first opportune moment. The plebeians were ripe for
</p>
<p>revolution ; the Dorias and nobility without the least
</p>
<p>suspicion. All things seemed propitious.
</p>
<p>Such was the condition of Genoa on the eve of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy. " Strange," says Cardinal de Eetz, " ten
</p>
<p>thousand persons in Italy were awaiting the outbreak
</p>
<p>of the insurrection, and there was not one to betray
</p>
<p>the plot." ^'
</p>
<p>We ought not, in my judgment, to decide upon the
</p>
<p>merits of this conspii\acy according to the views of our
</p>
<p>own time, in which political movements are discussed
</p>
<p>on principles of justice, but rather to give the conspira-
</p>
<p>tors the benefit of the opinions and politics of their own
</p>
<p>afire. The doctrines of Macchiavelli, on which Gian-
</p>
<p>luigi had formed his principles, aim at the immediate
</p>
<p>interests of states and derive principles from facts.
</p>
<p>The theory of Guicciardini is the same. Whoever
</p>
<p>undertakes to philosophise on the political ideas of the
</p>
<p>sixteenth century will find that State policy never pro-
</p>
<p>fessed any higher creed than utility, and that those

<p>who were ambitious of repute as statesmen were not

<p>bound by a public moral sentiment to show the justice
</p>
<p>of their methods for obtaininoj desirable ends. Who-
</p>
<p>ever had introduced on the scenes of state craft abstract
</p>
<p>maxims of morality would have been hissed off as a
</p>
<p>fool. The creed ran thus : " Do you wish to free your
</p>
<p>country ? Caress the tyrant and then kill him. Your
</p>
<p>dagger is sharper than the eyes of his satellites.
</p>
<p>Audacity and courage are everything. He who falters
</p>
<p>for an instant is undone. Every means is just which
</p>
<p>leads to success."
</p>
<p>Grianluigi held these maxims and he could not lay
</p>
<p>them aside without freeing himself from the age in
</p>
<p>which he lived. It was natural, therefore, that with
</p>
<p>his noble intention of destroying the empire of the
</p>
<p>Dorias he should use every instrument which seemed
</p>
<p>adapted to his purpose. His heart was bursting with
</p>
<p>suppressed rage ; but his serene look and m'banc
</p>
<p>manners proclaimed him a peaceable and loyal citizen.
</p>
<p>His nerves were strung with the spirit of revenge, but
</p>
<p>his frank countenance, affiible speech and good humour
</p>
<p>were those of a mild-mannered and unruffled gentle-
</p>
<p>man. Once only he 'broke out against his rival with
</p>
<p>fierce invectives ; but ever after he feigned content
</p>
<p>and put to 'sleep his adversary's vigilance while medi-
</p>
<p>tating his blow. He knew no other paths to his
</p>
<p>end than those pointed out by the state craft of his
</p>
<p>time. Why should he awaken suspicion in the Dorias
</p>
<p>when all his interests said, " Deceive them" ? It
</p>
<p>is folly to arm an enemy who is delivering himself
</p>
<p>unarmed into your power. Such, we have said, was

<p>the political morality of the speculative minds of that
</p>
<p>day.
</p>
<p>In other respects Fieschi was counted virtucgis and
</p>
<p>honourable and uncorrupted in the bosom of a corrupt
</p>
<p>society ; so that it is very doubtful whether he had a
</p>
<p>natural son named Paolo Emilio who was afterwards
</p>
<p>a captain in the pay of France, of which fact we find
</p>
<p>mention in some memoirs. Fame said of him that he
</p>
<p>had never punished, even in the slightest manner, any
</p>
<p>person in his service or vassalage.
</p>
<p>He deceived the Dorias and betrayed them against
</p>
<p>faith ; but only for a political object. The high design
</p>
<p>of overthrowing one who had attempted his assassination
</p>
<p>and of liberating his country ought, if it cannot absolve
</p>
<p>him, to moderate the condemnation of posterity.
</p>
<p>Brutus, too, was a deceiver and he is reputed great.
</p>
<p>Whatever be the ideas of those who read in the
</p>
<p>nineteenth century, it is clear that the statesmen of
</p>
<p>the sixteenth heartily approved of Fieschi's work. He
</p>
<p>Avas what these times made him. A stranger to the
</p>
<p>spirit of the classic revolutions of the earlier part of
</p>
<p>his century, to the ascetic revolts of Savonarola, to the
</p>
<p>paralytic ardoure of Soderini, he drank in with his
</p>
<p>Guclph principles the dissimulation of Kome. An
</p>
<p>Italian and a disciple of Macchiavelli, he washed to
</p>
<p>liberate his country without the aid of foreign arms.

<p>A more favourable time could not have been desired.

<p>Everything being now in readiness, the count called

<p>together a few of his most trusted partisans to consult
</p>
<p>upon the time and plan of their uprising.
</p>
<p>About this time were celebrated the espousals of
</p>
<p>Giulio Cybo, prince of Massa and Carrara and brother
</p>
<p>of Eleonora Fieschi, with Peretta, the sister of Gia-
</p>
<p>nettino. Verrina proposed that Gianluigi should give
</p>
<p>a splendid banquet to the young couple which the
</p>
<p>Dorias would be obliged to attend ; and, that in the
</p>
<p>midst of the festivities, assassins concealed for the
</p>
<p>purpose should fall upon and butcher them. We find
</p>
<p>that Verrina sent a messenger to Milan to make pur-
</p>
<p>chases for the banquet and that with these purchases
</p>
<p>he introduced into the palace some chests filled with
</p>
<p>ammunition, swords, arquebuses pikes and halberds.'"'

<p>However, the count refused his assent to the proposition

<p>as a violation of the laws of hospitality.

<p>THE SUPPER IN VIALATA. 149
</p>
<p>If wc may believe Sigonio, Verrina formed another
</p>
<p>not less inhuman project. An ecclesiastic of an
</p>
<p>illustrious family was about to celebrate his first mass
</p>
<p>in the church of St. Ambrogio, and the Dorias, Adamo
</p>
<p>Centurione, his son Marco, Figuerroa and other old
</p>
<p>nobles were expected to be present, Verrina proposed
</p>
<p>to follow the example of the Pazzi in Florence and of
</p>
<p>Olgiato in Milan and to assassinate them while kneeling
</p>
<p>at the altar ; then to rouse the city, take possession of
</p>
<p>the senatorial palace, crown Fieschi with the diadem
</p>
<p>of the Doges and put to the edge of th<3 sword all who
</p>
<p>offered resistance. But this atrocious design against
</p>
<p>the liberties of the republic is denied by all the histo-
</p>
<p>rians of the period. Even the writers most partial to
</p>
<p>the Dorias tell us that Gianluigi rejected the temptation
</p>
<p>to assassinate Gianettino under the shadow of the
</p>
<p>crucifix, though he was convinced that he could find
</p>
<p>no better opportunity of crushing his rival at a single
</p>
<p>blow.
</p>
<p>The count abhorred bloodshed. In fact but little was
</p>
<p>spilled in all the fierce civil commotions of Genoa.
</p>
<p>These revolutions resemble wars of adventurers which
</p>
<p>have no other aim than to capture the enemy. There
</p>
<p>was no fighting to the death ; he who refused to yield
</p>
<p>the field or broke the lines of his enemy was proclaimed
</p>
<p>conqueror without more ado. He who got possession
</p>
<p>of the government palace seldom punished his adver-
</p>
<p>saries beyond confiscation of goods and banishment.

<p>150 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGI FIESCHT.
</p>
<p>bring himself to approve schemes of corruption and
</p>
<p>slaughter.
</p>
<p>Other propositions were then made. Among these
</p>
<p>the most prominent was that of awaiting the period
</p>
<p>for electing a new Doge, that is the fourth of the
</p>
<p>following January. The entire nobility would then be
</p>
<p>assembled in the government palace, and a single blow
</p>
<p>would sever the knot. The plan seemed every way
</p>
<p>feasible and Gianluigi was disposed to follow it ; but
</p>
<p>it was abandoned because it was found Gianettino
</p>
<p>would be absent and escape the vengeance of Fieschi.
</p>
<p>It was at length resolved to make a bolder attempt on
</p>
<p>Christmas Eve, 1547 (old style.)
</p>
<p>Orders were therefore issued on this plan to the
</p>
<p>corporals in the city and to conspirators in other places,
</p>
<p>particularly to Gianluca Fieschi, Giulio Cybo and the
</p>
<p>marquis of Valdimagra. A number of armed men
</p>
<p>were introduced into the city under cover of the festi-
</p>
<p>vities of that day on which the burghers are wont to
</p>
<p>flock into the city from every direction. Much artifice
</p>
<p>was employed in bringing in the troops. They entered
</p>
<p>in small bodies and by difierent gates, some even by
</p>
<p>subterranean passages which conducted to the palace of
</p>
<p>the count. Some wore the habit of mountaineers,
</p>
<p>others had various disguises. A number were loaded
</p>
<p>with chains under pretence that they were criminals
</p>
<p>condemned to serve on the galleys of the count. Some
</p>
<p>were lodged in the houses of the conspirators, but the
</p>
<p>greater part in the palace in Vialata and neighbouring

</p>
<p>brought witliin the walls, but distributed over mount
</p>
<p>Fasce and contiguous heights, ready to enter the gates
</p>
<p>so soon as a smoke should rise from the hill of Carig-
</p>
<p>nano. Such was the good order and discretion of the
</p>
<p>conspirators that the Senate had not the faintest
</p>
<p>suspicion.
</p>
<p>Early in the day count Fieschi, mounted upon a
</p>
<p>spirited jennet, rode through the populous streets. He
</p>
<p>had never appeared so jovial and composed, his strong
</p>
<p>will governing his impetuous nature.
</p>
<p>We find in some letters of Sacco,* of which we shall
</p>
<p>speak in another place, that a personage whose
</p>
<p>name is concealed held a conference that day with
</p>
<p>the count in the palace of Vialata. This person dis-
</p>
<p>coursed of the popular dislike for the Doria govern-
</p>
<p>ment, and concluded by saying that the count had
</p>
<p>only to wish it to become master of Genoa. It is
</p>
<p>easy to see, that the count brusquely repulsed the
</p>
<p>insinuation. Sacco believed that this man had been
</p>
<p>sent by Gianettino to pry into the plans and purposes
</p>
<p>of Fieschi ; but it is now certain that the Dorias were
</p>
<p>living in entire ignorance of the tempest gathering over
</p>
<p>their heads. The unknown personage must have been
</p>
<p>one of the spies whom Figuerroa kept on the trail of
</p>
<p>all the opponents of the Spanish power in Italy.
</p>
<p>Near the close of the day the count visited several
</p>
<p>families. He went to the Doria palace, where, finding
</p>
<p>in the vestibule the children of Gianettino with their
</p>
<p>father, he caressed and kissed them with much tender-

</p>
<p>ness. After some conversation he drew Gianettino
</p>
<p>aside and begged liim to make no opposition to the
</p>
<p>departure of some of his vessels which were that night
</p>
<p>to sail for the Levant. He added that if the vessels
</p>
<p>should discharge some fire-arms in the port, he hoped
</p>
<p>the admiral would give himself no concern. He also
</p>
<p>requested Gianettino to interpose his good offices with
</p>
<p>prince Doria in case the prince should oppose the
</p>
<p>count's plan of privateering. This plan was in fact a
</p>
<p>violation of the treaty between the emperor and the
</p>
<p>Turks, because the galleys of Fieschi would have sailed
</p>
<p>from a port over which Doria was, as the admiral of
</p>
<p>Csesar, master and guardian. Gianettino, not from
</p>
<p>any love he bore the coimt, as a modern writer rem arks,
</p>
<p>but because the favour was of trivial importance, pro-
</p>
<p>mised to use his influence with the prince if it should
</p>
<p>become necessary, and gave to his captains the order
</p>
<p>requested by Fieschi.
</p>
<p>Afterwards, Gianluigi went to the apartment of
</p>
<p>Andrea who was lying in bed suffering from pains and
</p>
<p>a fever. It happened that the prince was at that
</p>
<p>moment in conversation with Gomez Suarez Figuerroa,
</p>
<p>who, having received repeated messages from Gonzaga
</p>
<p>respecting the conspiracies of Fieschi, had come to
</p>
<p>speak of the soldiers taken by the count from tjie duke
</p>
<p>of Piacenza and other facts wearing an ambitious
</p>
<p>appearance. But so soon as Andrea saw the count on
</p>
<p>his threshold, at the sight of the ingenuous and
</p>
<p>courteous youth whom he loved almost as a son, he

<p>bent his head to the ear of the minister and whispered, 
</p>
<p>THE SUPPER IN VIALATA. 153
</p>
<p>" Tell me yourself if it be possible that a base spirit
</p>
<p>can be concealed under that angelic countenance."''
</p>
<p>After a brief conversation the count retired, mounted
</p>
<p>his superb jennet and rode gracefully along the streets.
</p>
<p>Figuerroa exhausted all his arts to remove the delusion
</p>
<p>of Doria but without success.
</p>
<p>Shortly after, Andrea was on the verge of making
</p>
<p>the discovery by other means, but in this case, by
</p>
<p>combinations of chance, Gianettino was the person to
</p>
<p>dissipate his apprehensions. Giocante, of the Casa
</p>
<p>Bianca family, who had once been in the service
</p>
<p>of the Venitians, had command of the permanent
</p>
<p>militia.
</p>
<p>He had distinguished himself in many actions and
</p>
<p>especially when fighting with Doria at the head of a
</p>
<p>large body of Ligurians in favour of France against the
</p>
<p>Bourbons, he raised the siege of Marseilles. Colonel
</p>
<p>Giocante had received on this very day several messages
</p>
<p>informing him that many soldiers of various detach-
</p>
<p>ments had left their quarters and taken refuge in the
</p>
<p>house of Fieschi. Doria being in fact, though not
</p>
<p>nominally, the head of the republic, Giocante informed
</p>
<p>him and Adamo Centurione of what had occurred.
</p>
<p>As soon as he had read the letter, Andrea called
</p>
<p>Gianettino and ordered him to provide for the emerg-
</p>
<p>ency ; but Gianettino related the conversation he had
</p>
<p>just held with the count and reasoned that the momen-
</p>
<p>tary desertion of a few soldiers, who were probably
</p>
<p>vassals of the Fieschi and wished to celebrate the day

</p>
<p>in Vialata, was of no importance. He concluded by
</p>
<p>saying that Giocante attached consequence to frivolous
</p>
<p>matters, and so entirely removed the suspicions of the
</p>
<p>prince.
</p>
<p>The restless Yerrina was not idle. At nightfall he
</p>
<p>collected, in the house of Tomaso Assereto, more than
</p>
<p>thirty gentlemen whose families had but recently been
</p>
<p>inscribed in the book of gold. Fieschi, after leaving
</p>
<p>Doria went directly to this place and invited these new
</p>
<p>noblemen to sup with him that night in Carignano.
</p>
<p>Arriving there many were surprised to find, in place
</p>
<p>of festive preparations, the halls filled with arms and
</p>
<p>armed men, strange faces and the din of warlike pre-
</p>
<p>paration. They looked round for the count, but he
</p>
<p>had gone to confer with Verrina and to learn whether
</p>
<p>he had visited all the stations and the mustering places
</p>
<p>of the conspirators, whether the Senate entertained any
</p>
<p>suspicions or his near neighbours the Sauli had obtained
</p>
<p>any information of the conspiracy. Verrina assured
</p>
<p>him that all was prepared and that none of their adver-
</p>
<p>saries suspected their preparations for revolution, and
</p>
<p>the count joined his guests.
</p>
<p>These gentlemen, alarmed at finding the palace a
</p>
<p>camp rather than a festive hall, gathered about him to
</p>
<p>learn the cause of these extraordinary sights and
</p>
<p>sounds. Then the count changing his careless look
</p>
<p>into one of stern purpose and striking the naked table
</p>
<p>with his fist, broke out,  " The time so longed for by

</p>
<p>tyranny of the few and restored to a popular govern-
</p>
<p>ment. This is my banquet, these are the festivals to
</p>
<p>which I have invited you. You will never be invited
</p>
<p>to a more honourable feast. With the approbation of
</p>
<p>Csesar, (and if you wish I will show you the proofs
</p>
<p>and letters.) Gianettino Doria grown to excessive
</p>
<p>power and riches has long aspired to tyranny in Genoa.
</p>
<p>But finding me an obstacle to his designs, because I
</p>
<p>am not less devoted to the public good and the liberties
</p>
<p>of the nation than were my ancestors, he employs him-
</p>
<p>self day and night in conspiring against my life. He
</p>
<p>has often vainly tried poison ; now he trusts to the
</p>
<p>secret dagger. Who of you does not swell with indig-
</p>
<p>nation at the insolence of the old nobility, who both
</p>
<p>in their private life and in the public ofiices deprive
</p>
<p>you of honour and hold you in derision ? I tell you
</p>
<p>that more bitter and shameful things are reserved for
</p>
<p>us. If we sujffer so much to-day, what shall we have
</p>
<p>when the patricians, with Gianettino at their head,
</p>
<p>shall have drawn to themselves all public authority
</p>
<p>and reduced us to vassalage ? You will become a
</p>
<p>plebeian herd ! Let us then grapple like heroes with
</p>
<p>evils which overhang me, yourselves and the country.
</p>
<p>It is my design to kill the ambitious tyrant and Doria
</p>
<p>himself, to captm^e their galleys, to occupy the govern-
</p>
<p>ment palace and by destroying a few powerfid enemies
</p>
<p>to restore popular liberty.

<p>encounter the clanger alone. But the city is now in
</p>
<p>our power. Three hundred of my bravest men are
</p>
<p>with me, the greater part of the soldiers who guard the
</p>
<p>government palace are my partisans. The keepers of
</p>
<p>the gates are for us and await a preconcerted signal.
</p>
<p>A galley rides at anchor in the port armed with a body
</p>
<p>of men unsurpassed for equipment, strength and
</p>
<p>courage. One thousand and five hundred artisans are
</p>
<p>in arms to follow me. Two thousand men from my
</p>
<p>castles are at the gates. As many more from Piacenza
</p>
<p>will follow them. We have no enemy before us. The
</p>
<p>night is serene and everything is propitious. You will
</p>
<p>not be companions in the battle but spectators of a
</p>
<p>victory. Give your love to your country ; raise your
</p>
<p>courage, your confidence. The glory and honour of
</p>
<p>this undertaking are not only yours to share but yours
</p>
<p>to dispense.
</p>
<p>We have preferred to translate from the Latin of
</p>
<p>Bonfadio'"" this speech of the count rather than to
</p>
<p>compose one in the style of rhetoricians. Bonfadio,
</p>
<p>who was a witness of that revolt, thus clearly displays
</p>
<p>the object of Fieschi to overthrow Giniiettino who
</p>
<p>aimed to master the republic and to build again the
</p>
<p>popular government. Still, we are not able to agree
</p>
<p>with Bonfadio that the count intended to assassinate
</p>
<p>Andrea ; because what we have written tends to prove
</p>
<p>the contrary, and still more because the mm-der of the
</p>
<p>old and decrepit prince would have provoked universal
</p>
<p>condemnation, and finally because the means of escape

</p>
<p>were left open to him. It was doubtless for the inter-
</p>
<p>ests of Bonfadio to receive this fable and incorporate it
</p>
<p>in his history, to justify Doria's sanguinary vengeance.
</p>
<p>The words of Gianluigi powerfully moved his guests.
</p>
<p>They enthusiastically offered to share the perils of the
</p>
<p>enterprise. Two, Giovanni Battista Cattaneo-Bava and
</p>
<p>Giovanni Battista Giustiniano, alone refused to take
</p>
<p>arms ; not because they dissented from the views of
</p>
<p>Fieschi, but because they trembled at the sight of
</p>
<p>muskets and sabres. Some of their companions drew
</p>
<p>their dao:o;ers and Avished to assassinate the cowards on
</p>
<p>the spot ; but Gianluigi interposed and contented
</p>
<p>himself with confining them under guard to prevent
</p>
<p>their revealing the conspiracy. This is a new proof of
</p>
<p>the count's unwillingness to shed blood.
</p>
<p>Fieschi then placed, one by one, under the eyes of his
</p>
<p>com]^?anions the letters of Pierluigi, of cardinal Farnese
</p>
<p>and of others, which clearly showed that Gianettino
</p>
<p>aspired to royal state and, as if already mounted to a
</p>
<p>throne, was planning the death of the count. A cry
</p>
<p>of indignation burst from the whole company and all
</p>
<p>swore to liberate the country and the count from the
</p>
<p>plots of the common enemy.
</p>
<p>Fieschi then visited his wife whom he found im-
</p>
<p>mersed in the most profound sorrow. The military
</p>
<p>preparation, the clang of arms and the crowd filling
</p>
<p>the palace had too clearly revealed to her that a bloody
</p>
<p>enterprise was on foot. He tried to console her, told
</p>
<p>her for the first time the long history of his conspu'acy

</p>
<p>and assured her that no danger lay before him. But
</p>

</p>
<p>Eleonora strove to cliange his audacious purpose. She
</p>
<p>kissed him, she hung upon his neck and exhausted her
</p>
<p>affectionate acts to bend his resolute will. Pansa
</p>
<p>entered at that moment and he, too, tried to divert
</p>
<p>him from the undertaking; but with no better success
</p>
<p>than the countess Eleonora. Fieschi embraced his
</p>
<p>beloved spouse whose tears moved his heart to profound
</p>
<p>pity ; but his preparations were made, and if he had
</p>
<p>wished it there was no place for retreat. When the
</p>
<p>stern voice of Verrina called him from her arms, the
</p>
<p>tears disappeared in an instant from his eye-lashes ;
</p>
<p>the husband vanished and only the conspirator re-
</p>
<p>mained. Eleonora fell lifeless into the arms of Pansa.
</p>
<p>The count returned to the hall, ordered a frugal
</p>
<p>meal and then distributed the arquebuses, pikes, spears,
</p>
<p>swords and coats of mail. There was a story that at
</p>
<p>that moment the soot of the chimney caught fire and
</p>
<p>that the cries of the countess filled the heart of the
</p>
<p>count with painful forebodings. There were other
</p>
<p>fables ; that a flock of birds rising from the garden
</p>
<p>below flew ofi" to the left, that during the day his horse
</p>
<p>stumbled and nearly threw him from his saddle, that a
</p>
<p>dog bayed long and mournfully, that setting his foot
</p>
<p>carelessly on the threshold of his palace as he went out
</p>
<p>he nearly fell down. They tell us that Calcagno, who
</p>
<p>was at his side at this moment, said to him that
</p>
<p>according to the ancients sinister presages usually fore-
</p>
<p>told success, and then the count recovered his spirits

<p>the way to the street.
</p>
<p>THE SUPPER IN VIALATA. 159
</p>
<p>Thus far we have in these fables only the mania for
</p>
<p>classic imitation which bewiklered the historians of
</p>
<p>Gianluigi, and led them to underrate his courage.
</p>
<p>Now come the calumnies. We are told that the count
</p>
<p>.ordered that whosoever moved from the ranks or
</p>
<p>hesitated should be run through ; that being asked on
</p>
<p>the way by a noble, who wished to save some friend,
</p>
<p>whether all the nobility were to be butchered, he
</p>
<p>answered that all should be slain beginning from his
</p>
<p>own nearest relatives. It is clear that these romancers
</p>
<p>destroyed all confidence in their veracity by such
</p>
<p>exaggeration.
</p>
<p>To disprove their partial statements it is only neces-
</p>
<p>sary to say that Gianluigi himself had prevented the
</p>
<p>assassination of the two nobles who had refused to fol-
</p>
<p>low him. He forbade an attack on the palace of
</p>
<p>Prince Doria, and would not even consent that Sebas-
</p>
<p>tiano Lercaro should be killed, though he knew that
</p>
<p>this person had accepted the commission of Gianettino
</p>
<p>to assassinate himself.
</p>
<p>Having drawn up his ranks and exhorted the men
</p>
<p>to prefer a glorious death to preserving their lives by
</p>
<p>cowardice, he sent off one hundred and fifty infantry
</p>
<p>to occupy the Borgo de' Lanieiri, and marched down
</p>
<p>the descent of San Leonardo followed by the gentlemen
</p>
<p>and by the select part of his troops. The hour was

<p>Halting for a moment at tlie foot of the hill, near

<p>the ancient houses of the Frangipani, the count sent
</p>
<p>his brother Cornelio to capture and hold the gate of
</p>
<p>the Archi in order to secure a way of retreat to his
</p>
<p>castles in case the enterprise should fail. He directed
</p>
<p>his brothers Ottobuono and Gerolamo, who had just
</p>
<p>returned from the court of France, to hold themselves
</p>
<p>and their men in readiness to attack the gate of San
</p>
<p>Tommaso at a preconcerted signal. The capture of
</p>
<p>that strong place being an affair of moment, Calcagno
</p>
<p>was ordered to support the attacking party with the
</p>
<p>main body of the troops. Those were the movements
</p>
<p>in the city. As for the harbour, Verrina had orders to
</p>
<p>work his galley outside of the Mandraccio and up to

<p>the gates of the arsenal, thus laying siege to the ships

<p>stress of the enterprise lay in taking these ships of
</p>
<p>Doria, because they constituted the emperor's naval
</p>
<p>force and were able to ' command the Mediterranean.
</p>
<p>Therefore, to make sure work at this point, the count
</p>
<p>sent orders to Scipione Borgognino, one of his vassals
</p>
<p>and a brave soldier, to eml^ark the flower of the troops
</p>
<p>upon some floats which had been prepared and to storm
</p>
<p>the arsenal on the sea side, and having gained the
</p>
<p>inside to open the gates unless Assereto had already
</p>
<p>forced them.
</p>
<p>The count reserved to himself no particular com-
</p>
<p>mand, but was at liberty to fly to the point of greatest
</p>
<p>need. He entered the city through the gates of St.
</p>
<p>Andrea, passed down the streets of Prione and San
</p>
<p>Donato, gained the piazza of Salvaghi and advancing
</p>
<p>to the bridge of Cattanei, now destroyed, waited near
</p>
<p>Marinella until Verrina should inform him with a
</p>
<p>discharge from a bombard that the attack on the arsenal
</p>
<p>was began.
</p>
<p>He intended,having occupied the arsenal and mounted
</p>
<p>crews on the galleys of Doria, to unite the various
</p>
<p>corps distributed through the city and move to the
</p>
<p>assault of the Doge's palace, the taking of which would
</p>
<p>crown the enterprise with complete success. He em-
</p>
<p>ployed a subtle artifice to secure the death of Gia-
</p>
<p>nettino. It was reasonably apprehended that the young
</p>
<p>admiral, awakened by the din which would necessarily
</p>
<p>be made in the harbour and arsenal, would take refuge
</p>
<p>in a galley which always rode at anchor under the

<p>prince's palace. To exclude this mode of flight, a large
</p>
<p>number of floats heavily laden were placed, some days
</p>
<p>before, in front of this ship so as to render it impossible
</p>
<p>to move her. Finally, it was agreed and ordered that
</p>
<p>the cry used to arouse the plebeians and win their
</p>
<p>stout arms to the cause of Fieschi should be :  " The
</p>
<p>people and liberty!'
</p>
<p>This was the general plan of insurrection. At first
</p>
<p>every movement was successful. Cornelio occupied
</p>
<p>the gate of the Archi with but little bloodshed ; but
</p>
<p>the fortress of San Tommaso proved a serious obstacle
</p>
<p>to the conspirators. Captain Sebastiano Lercaro and
</p>
<p>his brother were in command there. Both had the
</p>
<p>reputation of being valiant soldiers, and they were
</p>
<p>thoroughly devoted to the Dorias to whom they owed
</p>
<p>their rank in the permanent militia. As soon as they
</p>
<p>saw a large body of men moving against them and
</p>
<p>heard the air ring with the name of Fieschi, they pre-
</p>
<p>pared for a vigorous defence.
</p>
<p>Captain Lercaro, who, according to rumour, had
</p>
<p>accepted a commission to assassinate Fieschi, knew
</p>
<p>well that his own life and that of his masters' depended
</p>
<p>upon a successful resistance, and he exerted himself
</p>
<p>with such spirit and prowess that he several times
</p>
<p>repulsed the assailants with serious loss. But Gerolamo
</p>
<p>and Ottobuono returned to the assault with undimi-
</p>
<p>nished courage, and Calcagno came to their succour with
</p>
<p>reinforcements. The conflict now became too unequal.

</p>
<p>Lercaro, seeing himself well-nigh abandoned and his
</p>
<p>brother stretched at his feet by a blow from a halberd,
</p>
<p>surrendered to the Fieschi. Manfredo Centurione,
</p>
<p>Vincenzo Promontorio, Vaccari and some other ofEcers
</p>
<p>and soldiers followed his example.
</p>
<p>The palace of Prince Andrea stood within a stone's
</p>
<p>throw of the gate of San Tommaso which the Fieschi
</p>
<p>had now occupied. Gianettino, awakened by the din
</p>
<p>of arms and fearing that there was a mutiny on his
</p>
<p>galleys, determined to go immediately to the arsenal.
</p>
<p>His consort in vain urged him with tears not to set
</p>
<p>foot outside the palace, as though she too had sad
</p>
<p>presage of her destiny. In vain Andrea united his
</p>
<p>prayers to those of his wife. " This, said the prince, is
</p>
<p>not a mutiny or quarrel among our crews. It is the
</p>
<p>roar of battle." A relentless destiny drew the young
</p>
<p>admiral on to his fate. Still believing that it was
</p>
<p>some disturbance among his own crews, he set forth
</p>
<p>for San Tommaso to obtain troops to quell the disorder.
</p>
<p>He had only a page as an escort. The flicker of his
</p>
<p>own lamp revealed him to his enemies, and rejoicing
</p>
<p>at their good fortune they permitted him to approach
</p>
<p>and fall into their net. Arriving at the walls, he
</p>
<p>demanded in his usual imperious tone that the door be
</p>
<p>opened. At that moment, pierced by many pikes, he
</p>
<p>fell in a pool of his oWn blood. It is now known that
</p>
<p>the first and fatal blow was dealt by Agostino Bigelotti
</p>
<p>da Barga, a soldier of the government.

<p>164 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGI FlESCHt.
</p>
<p>Gerolamo Fieschi now began to fortify his position,
</p>
<p>Gianettino, tlie expected tyrant of Genoa, being dead,
</p>
<p>it was no longer desirable to assail the Doria palace.
</p>
<p>The decrepit Andrea was not obnoxious to their rage.
</p>
<p>He was in error or spoke falsely who wrote that Fieschi
</p>
<p>desired the death of Prince Doria that he might
</p>
<p>plunder the splendid carvings, sculptiu'es and furniture
</p>
<p>of the Doria palace. The government itself by the
</p>
<p>mouth of the lawyers of Padua, affirmed that Fieschi
</p>
<p>did not wish to assault that house or to vent his wrath
</p>
<p>against the prince, towards whom he felt no personal
</p>
<p>grudge. This is the most splendid testimony that
</p>
<p>Gianluigi did not aspire to power but to liberate the
</p>
<p>Republic. And if those who undertook to transmit to
</p>
<p>posterity the memory of these events had studied the
</p>
<p>official documents, they could not have distorted
</p>
<p>history by such grave errors. It is noteworthy, too,
</p>
<p>that the name of France was not uttered on that fatal
</p>
<p>night.
</p>
<p>Count Gerolamo left his brother Ottobuono to guard
</p>
<p>the gates and marched through the principal streets to
</p>
<p>arouse the people for the national cause. The word
</p>
<p>liberty, rung in the ears of people but yesterday des-
</p>
<p>poiled of rights which they had enjoyed for centuries,
</p>
<p>produced a marvellous effect in the deep midnight
</p>
<p>silence. New crowds crying, " Gatto and lihei^ty "
</p>
<p>gathered around the Fieschi standard. The very
</p>
<p>women who, when the first uproar called their husbands

<p>and brothers into the streets, clung to them with tears,

<p>when they heard the name of Fieschi hushed their sobs

</p>
<p>and uttered cries of joy. Such was the power of that
</p>
<p>name. The night was now dark ; the confusion and
</p>
<p>the terror became indescribable. The shouts of the
</p>
<p>populace and the blare of the trumpets filled the old
</p>
<p>nobles with mortal dismay, and closing their massive
</p>
<p>doors they did not venture to set foot in the streets.
</p>
<p>Suarez Figuerroa, the minister of Caesar, who had
</p>
<p>foreseen the conspiracy, though he had not believed
</p>
<p>the outbreak so near, was seized with a mortal fright,
</p>
<p>and wandered half insane through the streets in search
</p>
<p>of a way of escape from the city. Paolo Lasagna
</p>
<p>encountered him and dissipated his personal fears by
</p>
<p>assuring him that however the conflict might end, the
</p>
<p>character which the minister of Caesar bore would
</p>
<p>perfectly protect him from harm, and conducted him
</p>
<p>to the ducal palace. Lasagna, though he was not
</p>
<p>opposed, being a new noble, to the movement on foot,
</p>
<p>yet being a follower of the Adorni party, he thought
</p>
<p>the occasion propitious for the restoration of his friends
</p>
<p>to power. Therefore collecting some of his political
</p>
<p>sympathisers, he conferred with them, and they decided
</p>
<p>to wait until the balance should incline in favour of
</p>
<p>one or other of the contending parties. If the attempt
</p>
<p>of the Fieschi should be crushed, they would do nothing.
</p>
<p>But if it should triumph, then they would unite with
</p>
<p>the Spinola party and rouse the city with the cry of
</p>
<p>Barnaba Adorno. For the present, they would watch
</p>
<p>the course of the storm and see whom it destroyed.

</p>
<p>government. Besides Lasagna and Figuerroa, there
</p>
<p>were collected about him in the palace Cardinal
</p>
<p>Gerolamo Doria and Prince Adamo Centurione who
</p>
<p>had taken refuge there at the first sounds of revolution.
</p>
<p>On receiving intelligence of the assault on the gate of
</p>
<p>San Tommaso, they sent to reinforce it Bonifacio
</p>
<p>Lomellini, Cristoforo Pallavicini and Antonio Calvi
</p>
<p>with fifty men of the Ducal guard. The reinforcement
</p>
<p>had hardly reached the street Fossatello when it was
</p>
<p>surrounded and badly handled. The survivors with
</p>
<p>difficulty gained the Centurione palace and took shelter
</p>
<p>there. Francesco Grrimaldi, Domenico Doria and some
</p>
<p>other nobles had taken refuge in this palace. They
</p>
<p>reproached the fugitive soldiers with their cowardice
</p>
<p>and offered to lead them against the enemy. Though
</p>
<p>but few in number they advanced boldly against the
</p>
<p>revolutionists at San Tommaso ; but Calcagno made a
</p>
<p>vigorous sortie and routed them, killing some and
</p>
<p>capturing others.
</p>
<p>The count's enterprise was moving mtli full sails.
</p>
<p>Tommaso Assereto, who was appointed to carry the
</p>
<p>arsenal by a coiqo de main, arrived at the door and
</p>
<p>giving the countersign was about to enter without
</p>
<p>bloodshed, when his enthusiastic men sprang from
</p>
<p>under cover to enter with him and the garrison rushing
</p>
<p>to arms repulsed them with serious loss. The first
</p>
<p>attempt having failed, they went to the count who was
</p>
<p>awaiting the result of the attack in the street of Maruffi
</p>
<p>near the piazza San Pancrazio. He was fretting

</p>
<p>by the bombard as arranged with Vcrrina. At the
</p>
<p>news of the repulse, he broke into imprecations upon
</p>
<p>their cowardice, and ordered Scipione Borgognino to
</p>
<p>embark at once on the floats and attack the arsenal by
</p>
<p>sea, while he in person led the attack by land. To
</p>
<p>assail a strong fortress witli boats is a very perilous
</p>
<p>undertaking and it would not have been attempted
</p>
<p>but for the fierce ardour of Borgognino who, though
</p>
<p>not seconded by the galley of Verrina, determined to
</p>
<p>risk the assault.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately the galley of Verrina, was stationed
</p>
<p>in that part of the port which is called the Mandraccio,
</p>
<p>and when he attempted to work her towards the
</p>
<p>arsenal, she struck full on a sand bank under water,
</p>
<p>and held so firmly that their utmost efibrts could
</p>
<p>not get her afloat. This was the cause of Verrina's
</p>
<p>unexpected delay. At length, however, by superhuman
</p>
<p>exertion and enthusiasm they succeeded in lifting her
</p>
<p>off the bar and, with three other frigates, which had
</p>
<p>that same night arrived in port (as we read in the
</p>
<p>report of the Eepublic to Ceva Doria) moved forward
</p>
<p>to the assistance of Borgognino. The latter had over-
</p>
<p>come every resistance and driven the defenders from
</p>
<p>every defensible part of the works^ and the count,
</p>
<p>hearing the roar of the battle within, assailed the gates
</p>
<p>at the moment Borgognino, beating down all opposition,
</p>
<p>rushed into the arsenal and ran to open it to his
</p>
<p>leader.
</p>
<p>A more complete success could not have been hoped

</p>
<p>Assereto only had failed, and that chiefly because the
</p>
<p>disaster of the galley had prevented a simultaneous
</p>
<p>assault by sea and land.
</p>
<p>The night was dismal ; the sea stormy ; the cries of
</p>
<p>the Doria slaves, the clanking of their chains and the
</p>
<p>disorder of the assailants rendered the arsenal a scene
</p>
<p>of indescribable confusion. The count, seeing the
</p>
<p>necessity of preventing revolt among the galley slaves
</p>
<p>who were breaking their chains, with his natural
</p>
<p>audacity threw himself on board the galley in which
</p>
<p>the greatest disorder reigned, manned it with his own
</p>
<p>men and gave the command of it to some of his most
</p>
<p>trusted followers. Order was soon restored and he
</p>
<p>resolved to go into the city. He attempted to pass
</p>
<p>from the Capitana to the Padrona which was moored
</p>
<p>by the side of the former. But the shock of a float
</p>
<p>suddenly striking against them drove the vessels apart
</p>
<p>and the frail and imperfectly fastened bridge which
</p>
<p>connected them fell, carrying him with it down into
</p>
<p>the sea. With him fell the hopes of the revolutionists.
</p>
<p>Though the count was an able swimmer, he could not
</p>
<p>save himself on account of being encumbered with
</p>
<p>arms, and in the darkness and confusion no aid was
</p>
<p>rendered him.
</p>
<p>This is the history of his death according to the
</p>
<p>writers of the time, with the addition that the count
</p>
<p>and Gianettino perished in the same moment. But as
</p>
<p>the water in the arsenal was not deep and the count's

<p>inclined to adopt the opinion of Campanaceo that he
</p>
<p>struck his temples against the bridge in falling and
</p>
<p>either fell senseless into the waves, or was so weakened
</p>
<p>by the blow as to be unable to make any exertion. In
</p>
<p>fact, when the corpse was taken from the water the
</p>
<p>head was found to have suffered a severe contusion.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Prince Doria seeing that Gianettino did
</p>
<p>not return and hearing the cries and tumult among
</p>
<p>the galleys, despatched messenger after messenger to
</p>
<p>learn the occasion of the unwonted uproar. Captain
</p>
<p>Luigi Giulia at length brought him word that the
</p>
<p>Fieschi were in arms and the city ringing with their
</p>
<p>name. The old admiral fumed with vexation that his
</p>
<p>decrepitude forbade him to mingle in the fray. He
</p>
<p>was induced by the tears of Princess Peretta and the
</p>
<p>entreaties of his servants to send his wife into the
</p>
<p>adjacent convent of the Canonici Regolari di San
</p>
<p>Teodoro and the widow of Gianettino with her children
</p>
<p>into the. monastery of Gesu and Maria. Then mounting
</p>
<p>on horseback, escorted by Giulia, Count Filippino and
</p>
<p>four servants, he rode to Sestri whence he went upon
</p>
<p>a small oared bark to Voltri, and thence sent informa-
</p>
<p>tion of the revolution to the duke of Florence and
</p>
<p>Gonzaga in Milan, who were the only zealous partisans
</p>
<p>of the imperial cause in Italy. He was then placed in
</p>
<p>a palanquin and carried to the castle of Masone, a feud
</p>
<p>of Adamo Centurione, fifteen mdes distant from Genoa
</p>
<p>in the heights of the mountains. In this painful

<p>journey, he read upon the faces of his attendants the

</p>
<p>his grief was partly soothed by the hope of immolating
</p>
<p>the whole Fieschi family to his terrible vengeance.
</p>
<p>The first part of this conspiracy thus ended in a
</p>
<p>great misfortune ; but it saved the Republic by Gia-
</p>
<p>nettino's death. There can be no doubt that, had he
</p>
<p>survived he would have gratified his own lust of
</p>
<p>dominion and fulfilled the wishes of Csesar, who desired
</p>
<p>to divide Italy into principalities subject to himself
</p>
<p>and founded on the ruins of the republics averse to
</p>
<p>his empire.
</p>
<p>The body of Gianettino was buried in the subterra-
</p>
<p>nean chapel of San Matteo which is now adorned with
</p>
<p>the monument of Andrea, a beautiful work of Montorsoli.
</p>
<p>A brief episode will be permitted us here on the
</p>
<p>place in the harbour where Gianluigi was drowned.
</p>
<p>It is necessary to confute the error of those who tell
</p>
<p>us it occurred in the station of Mandraccio. The
</p>
<p>mistake arose from the confusion of various arsenals
</p>
<p>whose true position has been lost in the great changes
</p>
<p>wrought by time. The first arsenal of which we shall
</p>
<p>speak was nothing more than a small basin near the
</p>
<p>piazza Molo, protected in 1276 by a strip of land
</p>
<p>covered with heavy stones and palissades. Then
</p>
<p>galleys were built there. At an earlier period ships
</p>
<p>were constructed along the Borgo di Pre, then outside
</p>
<p>the walls, particularly in front of the commandery of
</p>
<p>St. John and near the basin of St. Limbania.
</p>
<p>It is difficult to comprehend how the Genoese, with-

<p>out any tolerable dockyards, were able in so short a

</p>
<p>for Palestine, and the two sent against Pisa in 1120
</p>
<p>and 1126. The first Pisan expedition numbered eighty
</p>
<p>galleys, four large ships, thirty-five gatti, twenty-eight
</p>
<p>calabi and other small craft manned by twenty-two
</p>
<p>thousand combatants ; and the second counted eighty
</p>
<p>triremes and forty-three boats. We have credible
</p>
<p>testimony that the Genoese equipped, in seven years,
</p>
<p>six hundred and twenty-seven triremes ; and in 1295,
</p>
<p>in less than a month, they put to sea two hundred
</p>
<p>galleys and other ships of which one hundred and five
</p>
<p>were entirely new, and embarked on them thirty-five
</p>
<p>thousand warriors, eight thousand of whom were
</p>
<p>dressed in silk and purple. The founder of the arsenal
</p>
<p>of which we speak was a certain Oliverio a cistercense
</p>
<p>monk of the Badia of St. Andrea in Sestri. He con-
</p>
<p>structed two roads on that strip of land, of which we
</p>
<p>have made mention, leading down to the gate of the
</p>
<p>Molo, where there was already a bridge of large stones
</p>
<p>on which rose a light-house for the convenience of
</p>
<p>mariners. In the same year, Marin Boccanegra raised
</p>
<p>a high wall around the Borgo di Molo which was then
</p>
<p>outside of the piazza of that name. This wall ran
</p>
<p>from the church of Our Lady of Grace aloug the shore

<p>to the tower of the light-house, then, tmming, it passed

</p>
<p>that though the excavations of Boccanegra are described
</p>
<p>as very deep, yet that there was not sufficient water in
</p>
<p>any part of the Mandraccio to float heavy galleys.
</p>
<p>Some years after the attempt of Fieschi, that is in
</p>
<p>1575, that part of the port which lies between the
</p>
<p>Ponte Cattanei and the little mole of Mandraccio then
</p>
<p>called the Goletta was dried under the direction of the
</p>
<p>Sicilian engineer Anastasio, and the rocks lying at the
</p>
<p>bottom of it were broken up and excavated for the
</p>
<p>distance of twenty palms.
</p>
<p>To enlarge this arsenal and protect it froln the fury
</p>
<p>of the waves, Boccanegra commanded, in 1283 the
</p>
<p>colossal structure of the Molo extending it one hundred
</p>
<p>and fifteen cubits into the sea. On the opposite side
</p>
<p>of the arsenal, rose the Ponte Cattanei, called by the
</p>
<p>name of the family who built it, and there was a
</p>
<p>passage by an easy stair to the Ponte di Mercanzia
</p>
<p>which led to the Portofranco and the Custom House.
</p>
<p>The latter occupied the ground floor of the bank of St.
</p>
<p>George, a palace which was adorned in 1262 with some
</p>
<p>marbles taken from the palace of the Venitians in
</p>
<p>Constantinople. To the right of the bank stood, and
</p>
<p>still stands, the Ponte Reale and next it those of
</p>
<p>Spinola, Legna and Calvi. In the vicinity of this last,
</p>
<p>the third arsenal was begun in the period of which
</p>
<p>we write, and behind it a fourth was afterwards
</p>
<p>constructed.
</p>
<p>The third arsenal, situated between the church of S.
</p>
<p>Fede and S. Antonio, was built in 1282 and ten

</p>
<p>were appropriated for its construction. It was after-
</p>
<p>wards doubled in size and half of it was appropriated
</p>
<p>to the wine trade and the collection of duties on the
</p>
<p>same. The other part was used as a station for galleys.
</p>
<p>Gianluigi on the night of the 2nd of January, passed
</p>
<p>from the street of Maruffi by way of Sottoripa to that
</p>
<p>part of the arsenal which was used for the trade in
</p>
<p>wine, and the gate of that part was opened by his men.
</p>
<p>From this gate he passed into the back part of the
</p>
<p>arsenal, where the Doria galleys lay, and there he was
</p>
<p>drowned and buried in the muddy bottom of the dock.
</p>
<p>He could not have met his fate in the fourth arsenal,
</p>
<p>which is the one existing in our day, because it was
</p>
<p>then unoccupied. Though begun in 1457 the works
</p>
<p>had fallen into ruin from the want of skill in the
</p>
<p>builders, and, they were not reconstructed until 1596.
</p>
<p>The news of Fieschi's death was received by the
</p>
<p>liberal spirits of Italy as a national misfortune. Matteo
</p>
<p>BandeUo a month after the event wrote :  " He was
</p>
<p>a young man of great heart and excellent speech ; his
</p>
<p>literary studies and the instructions of the learned and
</p>
<p>virtuous Paolo Panza had given him a maturity of
</p>
<p>judgment wonderful for his years. There is no
</p>
<p>learned man of Italy or France who had not com-
</p>
<p>mended him for his rare virtues, his intellectual gifts
</p>
<p>and the greatness of soul which led him though so
</p>
<p>young to combine everything with admirable prudence
</p>
<p>for freeing his country from the Spanish yoke."*
</p>
<p>Nor ought we to omit that opinion which, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to the same author, was expressed by Catando

<p>Catando said :  '"' In a conference held at Montebrano
</p>
<p>by the Fregosi, you, my masters, justly* commended
</p>
<p>Gian Aloise Fiesclii, for he truly deserved your praise.
</p>
<p>But I think that the most of you honoured his memory
</p>
<p>with your good opinion on the basis of the current
</p>
<p>estimate of his great virtues and singular mental
</p>
<p>accomplishments. But if you had known him as

<p>familiarly as I, the day would be too short to express
</p>
<p>your admii'ation. If I wished to recount to you all
</p>
<p>his merits, it would be easy to begin but impossible to

<p>finish my discourse. I shall omit then his birth which
</p>
<p>opened for him the paths to honour, his boyhood which

<p>impressed all the Genoese with boimdless expectation
</p>
<p>of his future, the prematurely ripened intelligence
</p>
<p>which he used in winning the love of the people and
</p>
<p>the good will of the nobility, so that the people adored
</p>
<p>him and the nobles admired and esteemed him. I
</p>
<p>forbear to enlarge on the repute which he had among
</p>
<p>the peasants of the Eastern Ei^dera and in the mountains
</p>
<p>towards Parma and Piacenza ; on the fact that his
</p>
<p>vassals never complained of the slightest injustice, and
</p>
<p>that he was so liberal when they were in w^ant that
</p>
<p>they adored him as a Pro\*idence, and that his neigh-
</p>
<p>bours had the highest respect for his wisdom. I pass
</p>
<p>by his affection for his brothers whom he wished to be

<p>the most distinguished proof of Fieschi's greatness was

<p>that he attempted great entei-prises. "We shall not

<p>they deserve to be collected and preserved. To justify
</p>
<p>this opinion, we give two stanzas of a popular song

<p>preserved in a codex of Beriana the subject of which is

<p>the death of the count, the sorrow felt by the Genoese

<p>COMPROMISES AND PUNISHMENTS.
</p>
<p>Gerolamo Fieschi continues the insurrection in Ms own name. 
</p>
<p>Consultations at the Ducal palace and fighting at San Siro. 
</p>
<p>The news of the death of Gianluigi discourages the insurgents.
</p>
<p> Paolo Panza carries to Gerolamo the decree of pardon. 
</p>
<p>Yerrina and others set sail for France.  The African slaves
</p>
<p>escape with Doria's galley.  Sack of Doria's galleys.  Return
</p>
<p>of Andrea and his thirst for vengeance.  Decree of condem-

</p>
<p>Schemes and intrigues of Doria to get possession of the Fieschi

</p>
<p>When Verrina had secured possession of the arsenal he
</p>
<p>landed and marched to meet the count ; but, learning
</p>
<p>that Gianluigi had entered the palace on the opposite
</p>
<p>side, he halted his men and awaited the orders of his
</p>
<p>master. He could find no trace of the count from the
</p>
<p>moment he had gone on board the Capitana, and after
</p>
<p>some delay he went to that vessel and finding her
</p>
<p>bridge broken began to suspect what had happened.
</p>
<p>His courage did not fail him. He immediately ordered
</p>
<p>the waters to be searched all around the galley, and
</p>
<p>having satisfied himself of the fate of his master would
</p>
<p>not allow the body to be taken up lest the sight of it
</p>
<p>should discourage his men. He left the arsenal in the

<p>charge of Tommaso Assereto and marched into the

<p>city, sending the diver who had found the body to
</p>
<p>COMPROMISES AND PUNISHMENTS. 177
</p>
<p>report their great calamity to Gerolamo Fieschi. At
</p>
<p>the same time he requested an interview with Gerolamo
</p>
<p>in order to devise means to conduct their enterprise
</p>
<p>without the inspiration of its master spirit.
</p>
<p>Gerolamo Fieschi, though full of audacity had not a
</p>
<p>hundreth part of his Ijrother's talents. Seeing that the
</p>
<p>death of Gianluigi had invested him with the head-
</p>
<p>ship of the family, he relied on the fidelity of his
</p>
<p>vassals and fellow-conspirators, and resolved to prosecute
</p>
<p>the revolution in his own name. But, overburdened
</p>
<p>by grief and weighty thoughts, he suffered Verrina's
</p>
<p>messenger to depart without any adequate answer.
</p>
<p>This neglect lost him the powerful support of Verrina's
</p>
<p>genius and threw the weight of the undertaking upon
</p>
<p>himself, a youth with no training or talent for so great
</p>
<p>an enterprise. He gathered about him a select body
</p>
<p>of militia and marched towards the Ducal palace,
</p>
<p>hoping to crown the conspiracy by a single blow.
</p>
<p>As we have said some Senators were assembled in
</p>
<p>this palace ; and among them was the historian
</p>
<p>Bonfadio in company with Giovanni Battista Grimaldi.
</p>
<p>A consultation was held after the news of the failure
</p>
<p>at San Tommaso, and it was determined to cease
</p>
<p>offering armed resistance to the conspirators and to
</p>
<p>endeavour to restore peace by friendly negotiations.
</p>
<p>Some persons offered to be the bearers of a peaceful
</p>
<p>message to the count ; these were Gerolamo Fieschi
</p>
<p>and Benedetto Fiesco-Canevari, both of the Savignone
</p>
<p>branch of the family; but leaving the Ducal palace
</p>
<p>they did not again return thither.

<p>178 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGI FIESCHL
</p>
<p>Cardinal Gerokmo Doria and senators G. B. Lercaro
</p>
<p>and Bernardo Interiano-Castagna were then com-
</p>
<p>missioned to carry to the count a request in the name
</p>
<p>of the Republic to desist from his violent proceedings
</p>
<p>and make known the object of his movement. But
</p>
<p>the commissioners having walked a short distance out-
</p>
<p>side of the chancel, seeing arms and crowds of people,
</p>
<p>were terrified and turned back. At the moment, the
</p>
<p>guard of the palace, not seeing the senators, fired on
</p>
<p>the crowd Avounding some persons and killing Francesco
</p>
<p>Rizzo an honoured citizen. The senators regained the
</p>
<p>hall, and a new deputation was appointed consisting
</p>
<p>of Agostino Lomellini, Giovanni Imperiale-Baliano,
</p>
<p>Ansaldo Giustmiani and Ambrogio Spinola, citizens of
</p>
<p>the highest rank and reputation. This deputation
</p>
<p>went in search of the count ; but near the church of
</p>
<p>San Siro, they found the streets thronged with in-
</p>
<p>suro-ents, and a combat occurred between the guard
</p>
<p>acting as escort for the senators and the people. It
</p>
<p>was a confused nocturnal battle and the soldiers were
</p>
<p>repulsed and fell back with the deputation.
</p>
<p>In that midnight skirmish, Lomellini, after barely
</p>
<p>escaping death, was taken prisoner and conducted to
</p>
<p>San Tommaso ; but he had the good fortune to make
</p>
<p>his escape dming the same night. The brave Gius-
</p>
<p>tiniani alone refused to yield or fly and demanded
</p>
<p>permission to pass on, as a peace messenger, to the
</p>
<p>quarters of Count Fieschi. He was led to the presence
</p>
<p>of Gerolamo and inquired for the Count of Lavagna.

<p>Gerolamo brusequely informed him that there was no
</p>
<p>COMPROMISES AND PUNISHMENTS. l79
</p>
<p>longer any Count Fiesclii but himself, and added that
</p>
<p>until the Ducal palace was delivered to his forces it
</p>
<p>would be a waste of words to make propositions. He
</p>
<p>would talk of peace after the surrender of the govern-
</p>
<p>ment into the hands of his partisans. With these
</p>
<p>words, Giustiniani was dismissed and the troops ordered
</p>
<p>to collect in the piazza of San Lorenzo and in front of
</p>
<p>the adjacent palace.
</p>
<p>Giustiniani, justly inferred from Gerolamo's incau-
</p>
<p>tious speech that the rumoiu' of the death of Gianluigi
</p>
<p>had good foundation, and that the conspiracy, having
</p>
<p>lost its able leader, would be easily crushed under the
</p>
<p>m.anagement of a young man without reputation or
</p>
<p>the support of popular affection. He returned to the
</p>
<p>palace in haste, informed the senator that Gianluigi
</p>
<p>was dead, and encouraged them to a spirited resistance.
</p>
<p>The government recovered its confidence, sent
</p>
<p>heralds to proclaim with the sound of the trumpet the
</p>
<p>death of Gianluigi and ordered the nobles to arm their
</p>
<p>servants and dependents. . These last orders were
</p>
<p>unnecessary. So soon as the trumpeters announced
</p>
<p>the fate of the great leader, the multitudes of plebeians
</p>
<p>were seized with terror, the lines of the troops thinned
</p>
<p>rapidly and the squares and streets began to be
</p>
<p>deserted.
</p>
<p>The artisans and mechanics, particularly, who were
</p>
<p>not attached to Gerolamo by the memory of kindness
</p>
<p>or by the affection of vassals had no longer a cause to
</p>
<p>maintain and they retired in despair to their homes.

<p>It was almost day break. The best and most liberty-

<p>loving citizens felt that the enterprise had fallen into
</p>
<p>the waves with Gianluigi, and fearing to be seen in
</p>
<p>arms when the day dawned and thus to expose them-
</p>
<p>selves to the vengeance of the patricians, made haste
</p>
<p>to abandon the field of victory. Many others who had
</p>
<p>stood ready to throw themselves into the ranks of the
</p>
<p>victors now sought the security of their own houses.
</p>
<p>All seemed to accept the unhappy fate of Fieschi as
</p>
<p>the judgment of God against the revolution. Un-
</p>
<p>certainty, panic and fright filled all breasts. The
</p>
<p>vassals of the count stood fast from loyalty to their
</p>
<p>lord, and the soldiers who had deserted the standards
</p>
<p>of the Rej^ublic were firm from desperation. A few
</p>
<p>others heroic by nature, among them the strong armed
</p>
<p>and stout hearted Gerolamo d' Urbino, did not tremble
</p>
<p>or hesitate but resolved to meet every danger with
</p>
<p>steadfast courage.
</p>
<p>The government learned all these things by means
</p>
<p>of messengers and spies who circulated among the
</p>
<p>insurgents, and it was proposed to attack the forces
</p>
<p>yet remaining under the standard of Gerolamo. How-
</p>
<p>ever, the more prudent part  taking account of the
</p>
<p>limited number of their troops, the uncertainty of their
</p>
<p>fidelity, the ferocity of the conspirators in whom
</p>
<p>desperation would increase animosity and courage and
</p>
<p>that much blood must be shed in such a contest 
</p>
<p>thought it more wise to pursue a policy of compromise
</p>
<p>and conciliation.

</p>
<p>at fii'st irresolute. He had not pushed his attack at
</p>
<p>once upon the palace and was now falling back and

<p>fortifying himself at the gate of the Archi. The
</p>
<p>authority of his preceptor finally prevailed over his
</p>
<p>ambition and animosity, and he promised to withdi'aw
</p>
<p>his men from the city. The act of pardon was written

</p>
<p>Count Gerolamo, trusting to the good faith of the
</p>
<p>Republic, spent a brief hour m Carignano and then set
</p>
<p>out with his followers for Montobbio, not wishing to
</p>
<p>depart from Italy lest the Dorias should assail his
</p>
<p>feuds. Ottobuono, Cornelio, Verrina, Sacco, Calcagno
</p>
<p>and other leaders of the conspiracy took a more j)rudent
</p>
<p>com'se and set sail on their galley for France. Mindful
</p>
<p>that a government rarely or never pardons treason, they
</p>
<p>removed themselves from its reach and took with them
</p>
<p>the prisoners they had captured at San Tommaso.
</p>
<p>AVhen they arrived off the mouth of the Varo
</p>
<p>they set the captives at liberty; among them were
</p>
<p>Sebastiano Lercaro, JVIanfredi Centurione and Vincenzo
</p>
<p>Vaccari. By releasing these prisoners they deprived
</p>
<p>themselves of a guarranty which might have saved
</p>
<p>theii* lives at a later period. These consph-ators were
</p>
<p>not the only persons who sailed from the port that
</p>
<p>morning.
</p>
<p>The convicts and Turkish captives on board the
</p>
<p>Doria galleys had broken theii' chains and they resolved
</p>
<p>to avail themselves of the imiversal confusion to make
</p>
<p>their escape. The ships of Prince Doria, Antonio Doria
</p>
<p>and some other private persons were lying dismantled
</p>
<p>in the harbour. In the fury of the tumult the galleys
</p>
<p>of Andrea were plundered by the plebeians and by the

<p>board the Capitana which had escaped the fury of the
</p>
<p>sack. There was a good reason for this exception.
</p>
<p>This galley, formerly called the Temperanza, had
</p>
<p>been a Venitian vessel and the men of Barbary had
</p>
<p>captured her and four other trii-emes in 1539, near
</p>
<p>Corfu in the waters of Paxo, taking prisoner at the
</p>
<p>same time the Commandant Francesco Gritti.
</p>
<p>Dragut E,ais was so pleased with the sailing qualities
</p>
<p>and rich equipment of the Capitana that he made her
</p>
<p>his flag-ship. Gianettino Doria captm^ed her in the
</p>
<p>engagement in which the corsair himself fell into our
</p>
<p>hands. On the night of the second of January the
</p>
<p>African prisoners to the number of tlu-ee hundred or
</p>
<p>more tln^ew themselves on board this galley, as a piece
</p>
<p>of their own property, and sailed out to sea. Though
</p>
<p>tw^o galleons of Bernardino Mendozza, which were
</p>
<p>anchored in another part of the harbour and so escaped
</p>
<p>the pillage, w^ere sent in chase at early da^vn, the
</p>
<p>fugitives made good their flight and after a long voyage
</p>
<p>arrived safely in Algiers.
</p>
<p>The Doria fleet sufl'ered grave damages in that night
</p>
<p>pillage, the furniture and rigging being reduced to a
</p>
<p>mass of ruins. These disorders originated with the
</p>
<p>liberated slaves, and the bad example was followed by
</p>
<p>the convicts who afterwards carried confusion and
</p>
<p>alarm into the city. Many of the lowest class of the
</p>
<p>people penetrated into the foundries and shipyards of
</p>
<p>Doria, and what they could not carry away they tlu-ew

<p>into the sea. During the following days, the convicts

<p>back to their oars, and some of the equipments of the
</p>
<p>ships were recovered by the zealous efforts of Adamo
</p>
<p>Centurione whose pecuniary interests were united to
</p>
<p>those of Doria.
</p>
<p>It is worth while to observe that the storm of this
</p>
<p>conspiracy broke over the ships of Andrea. The
</p>
<p>government issued a proclamation that whoever should
</p>
<p>have taken or should find anything belonging to the
</p>
<p>galleys of the prince, as arquebuses, pikes, halberds,
</p>
<p>visors, helmets, corselets, axes or any other arms or tool
</p>
<p>belonging to these vessels, should within three days
</p>
<p>consign them to the justices in the Riviera, or to the
</p>
<p>agents of Doria in Genoa, or deposit them in the
</p>
<p>churches of San Vito and Annunziata.
</p>
<p>Our historians have neglected to describe one of the
</p>
<p>galleys of Doria which was a wonderful specimen of
</p>
<p>Genoese naval architecture. She was built by Doria
</p>
<p>in 1539 for the personal use of Charles V. in his
</p>
<p>expedition to Tunis, and surpassed all other galleys
</p>
<p>by fifteen palms in length and four palms in breadth"'".
</p>
<p>She bore three standards of crimson damask, each
</p>
<p>twenty-three palms in length and beautifully em-
</p>
<p>broidered in gold. The one in the midst had in the
</p>
<p>centre a star with golden rays and appropriate inscrip-
</p>
<p>tions ; that at the stern bore the figure of an angel and
</p>
<p>the one on the prow a shield, a helmet and a sword.
</p>
<p>Besides, there were three flags at the poop also of
</p>
<p>damask and thirty palms in length, and another banner
</p>
<p>of white damask was embroidered with chalices, ponti-
</p>
<p>fical keys and red crosses, with fitting inscriptions.

</p>
<p>There were two flaas of red damask bearinor the im-
</p>
<p>pcrial columns and the device  -plus ultra  invented
</p>
<p>by the Milanese Marliano, physician to Charles V. and
</p>
<p>an excellent mathematician, The vessel also had
</p>
<p>twenty-four other flags of yellow damask and appro-
</p>
<p>priate devices. The saloon was adorned with beautiful
</p>
<p>arabesques in blue and gold, and the sides were
</p>
<p>tapestried with cloth of gold and silver, hung so as to
</p>
<p>represent pavillioned domes. The castle on the poop
</p>
<p>was covered with exquisite carvings and there were two
</p>
<p>carpets for the deck, one of scarlet cloth for daily use
</p>
<p>and another, for state occasions, of crimson velvet and
</p>
<p>brocade of gold. The crew wore satin jackets. The
</p>
<p>gun carriages, rigging and other furniture were all in
</p>
<p>the most perfect style and finish of the naval art of
</p>
<p>that period. The slaves and convicts ruined all these
</p>
<p>splendid equipments and furniture.
</p>
<p>After this pillage, prisoners of war and other slaves
</p>
<p>were treated with greater severity. For, though up to
</p>
<p>this period the young men served at the oar, yet many
</p>
<p>of the Mamalukes, as the Barbary prisoners were called
</p>
<p>in Genoa, had some privileges from the government
</p>
<p>and their servitude was not of a strict and painful
</p>
<p>character. Some of them had the permission to engage
</p>
<p>in minute traffic within the city and had their markets
</p>
<p>in the piazza of the arsenal and the Piano of St.
</p>
<p>Andrea. There they shaved and trimmed the beards of
</p>
<p>the citizens, and none could equal them in this art.
</p>
<p>They traded in 003*60, sugar, brandy, pipes, tobacco

</p>
<p>and game. They practised small frauds in their trade

<p>COMPROMISES AND PUNISHMENTS. 187
</p>
<p>and some of them grew rich, while many were able to
</p>
<p>buy themselves out of bondage. These privileges were
</p>
<p>now taken away from them, and were not restored
</p>
<p>until many years after. In this way the rigours of
</p>
<p>slavery were increased among us, though the system
</p>
<p>was restricted to the " infidels" who were either bought
</p>
<p>in Egypt or captured in war. It is true that a law of
</p>
<p>the Kepublic forbade the buying and selling of slaves
</p>
<p>in the land of the Sultan ; but this provision was
</p>
<p>evaded by shipping the captives to Caffa where the
</p>
<p>Grand Turk sent agents for the traffic. Our statutes
</p>
<p>by enacting grave penalties against slave-stealers, held
</p>
<p>slaves to be the absolute property of their masters;
</p>
<p>and in 1588 it was ruled that in a case of shipwreck
</p>
<p>the loss should be distributed pro rata counting all
</p>
<p>sorts of merchandise " including male and female
</p>
<p>slaves, horses and other animals."
</p>
<p>The government hastened to inform the emperor
</p>
<p>and Ferrante Gonzaga of the insurrection. The latter
</p>
<p>sent Cavalier Cicogna on a mission to the senate and
</p>
<p>he himself at the head of a strong force advanced to
</p>
<p>Voghera to watch the movements of the Fieschi at
</p>
<p>Montobbio. All the Italian princes friendly to the
</p>
<p>empire congratulated the Republic on its escape from
</p>
<p>the consph'acy. Cardinal Cibo, who sent as his
</p>
<p>messenger Ercole de Bucchi, the Duke of Florence, by
</p>
<p>his legate Jacopo de' Medici, and the ten conservators

<p>of liberty of Siena, by M. Nicodemo, offered their

</p>
<p>188 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGI FIESCHI.
</p>
<p>We find also a letter of Giulio Cybo, Marquis of
</p>
<p>Massa, in which he declares that he has collected troops
</p>
<p>at Borghetto to march to the assistance of the
</p>
<p>Eepublic ; but it became known afterwards that these
</p>
<p>troops had been massed to aid the Fieschi insurrection.
</p>
<p>They did not pertain alone to the Marquis of Massa,
</p>
<p>but also to Gasparo di Fosnuovo and other feuda-
</p>
<p>tories. We shall presently speak of the congratulations
</p>
<p>sent by the Pope and Pierluigi Farnese.
</p>
<p>The government pledged itself to universal amnesty ;
</p>
<p>we shall now see how it kept faith. Encouraged by
</p>
<p>the departure of the Fieschi, the senate despatched
</p>
<p>Benedetto Centurione and Domenico Doria to escort
</p>
<p>Andrea back to the city and to condole with him for
</p>
<p>the loss of Gianettino. This last was a piece of
</p>
<p>hypocrisy, for they secretly rejoiced over their deliver-
</p>
<p>ance from the rising tyrant. Andrea returned on the
</p>
<p>sixth of January and was received with regal pomp.
</p>
<p>We learn from old documents that the wrathful old
</p>
<p>man cloaked his vengeance under the mantle of patri-
</p>
<p>otic zeal, and, assembling the fathers on the very day
</p>
<p>of his return, told them in well-rounded phrases
</p>
<p>that the anmesty, having been granted under the
</p>
<p>pressure of necessity and without the free choice of the
</p>
<p>senate, ought not to be observed. It was, he said, of
</p>
<p>bad example and precedent to treat with rebels ; in a
</p>
<p>free country the voice of pity and affection ought to
</p>
<p>be unheeded and the rigour of the law steadfastly
</p>
<p>administered. It was needful, to save the Republic

</p>
<p>examples. The senate should make haste to prove to
</p>
<p>Caesar its zeal by punishing the outrages perpetrated
</p>
<p>against ships under his flag ; those only deserved
</p>
<p>pardon whose participation in the conspiracy had been
</p>
<p>forced or the effect of momentary passion. The Fieschi
</p>
<p>as enemies of the emperor and rebels against the
</p>
<p>Eepublic ought to be condemned to death and their
</p>
<p>goods confiscated. In no other way could the senate
</p>
<p>meet the wishes of Caesar and prove their zeal for the
</p>
<p>public safety.
</p>
<p>Those who did not agree with these sentiments of
</p>
<p>vengeance rather than justice did not dare to lift their
</p>
<p>voices against the will of Doria. The senate referred
</p>
<p>the question to a commission of jurists, who rather
</p>
<p>than incur the enmity of Doria, devoted themselves to
</p>
<p>find a justification for breach of faith and a decree of
</p>
<p>blood. They reported :  " The act of pardon is not
</p>
<p>binding because it was conceded in a rebellion with the
</p>
<p>sword at the throat of the nation ; and because it was
</p>
<p>not granted in a regular session of the senate but by a
</p>
<p>numberof them casually met and having no power under
</p>
<p>the laws to make decrees and issue amnesties. They
</p>
<p>further declared that Doria as the representative of Caesar
</p>
<p>could ]3roceed against the rebels, because neither he
</p>
<p>nor his master had given any promise of pardon.
</p>
<p>This opinion was chiefly invented by Bernardo Otto-
</p>
<p>buono who exhausted much subtle argument to
</p>
<p>procure the condemnation of the Fieschi. His dialectic
</p>
<p>and legal skill was at that time in great repute among

<p>pleadings, only to put a note of infamy before his
</p>
<p>name. The senate, ha\dng heard the complacent
</p>
<p>judgment of its legal advisers, took up the filthy burden
</p>
<p>and hastened to be rid of it by condemning the Fieschi.
</p>
<p>It is a new proof that Prince Doria possessed an
</p>
<p>absolute power over the Republic. But this solicitude
</p>
<p>for vengeance has crowned his name with an eternal
</p>
<p>reproach.
</p>
<p>The act of pardon was revoked ; the Fieschi and the
</p>
<p>soldiers who had deserted the standards of the senate,
</p>
<p>particularly Gerolamo d' Urbino, were declared guilty
</p>
<p>of high treason. The decree of condemnation bore the
</p>
<p>date of the 12th of February. We report it in full
</p>
<p>because, though rather an act of wrath than of justice,
</p>
<p>it serves to acquit Gianluigi of many crimes of which

</p>
<p>" On the niglit before the third of January in this pre-
</p>
<p>sent year,. Gianluigi Fieschi having secretly assembled
</p>
<p>armed men and concealed them in his house, corrupted
</p>
<p>and enticed some soldiers in the pay of the Eepublic,
</p>
<p>and with his brothers Gerolamo, Ottobuono and Cor-
</p>
<p>nelio and other partners in his guilt, issued forth
</p>
<p>armed, assailed and killed many of the guards, seized
</p>
<p>the gates of the city and cruelly assassinated Gianet-
</p>
<p>tino, lieutenant of Prince Doria, Captain General of
</p>
<p>the emperor on the seas ; then, uttering seditious cries,
</p>
<p>they incited the people to take up arms against the
</p>
<p>Kepublic, and induced some of them to break into the
</p>
<p>arsenal where lay the unprotected galleys of the said
</p>
<p>Prince Doria, the defender of Christianity, and to
</p>
<p>pillage the said vessels and liberate their slaves and
</p>
<p>convicts.
</p>
<p>" Not content with these crimes, the conspirators
</p>
<p>turned their arms against the commissioners of the
</p>
<p>senate, and demanded that this Ducal palace should
</p>
<p>be surrendered into their hands, threatening death to
</p>
<p>such as should resist their will. Having been ad-
</p>
<p>monished to lay down their arms and cease to disturb
</p>
<p>the public peace, they refused to obey until they
</p>
<p>obtained grace and pardon for themselves and their
</p>
<p>accomplices, which condition the senate accepted,
</p>
<p>believing it the most speedy remedy for the disorders

</p>
<p>and Benedetto Botto for ten years each. All the said
</p>
<p>persons will be required to leave the territories of the
</p>
<p>Republic within fifteen days and to remain beyond the
</p>
<p>frontiers for the periods assigned them severally under
</p>
<p>peril of death.
</p>
<p>Whereas the laws of the Republic forbid citizens to
</p>
<p>hold commerce with banished persons under heavy
</p>
<p>penalties, to prevent any from incurring these penalties
</p>
<p>through ignorance, we ordain that no citizen whatever
</p>
<p>shall hold any intercourse or have any correspondence
</p>
<p>by messengers or by letters with the said rebels and
</p>
<p>exiles, particularly that no one shall go or send any
</p>
<p>message to Montobl:)io under the penalties contained
</p>
<p>in the laws. And let every citizen be wary of his
</p>
<p>conduct, for they who shall be guilty mil be severely
</p>
<p>punished.

<p>Many have written that Scipione Fieschi was also
</p>
<p>involved in the condemnation of his brothers ; but the
</p>
<p>documents above given prove the contrary. This
</p>
<p>youth was hardly eighteen years of age and was
</p>
<p>pursuing legal studies in Bologna according to the
</p>
<p>custom of Genoese noblemen. We find in the list of
</p>
<p>the doctors in law of 1390 the names of Doria, Spinola,
</p>
<p>Salvago, Imperiali, Dinegro, Grilli and Montaldi, and,
</p>
<p>as we have shown, the Fieschi were conspicuous in legal
</p>
<p>learning. From a very early period they had studied
</p>
<p>law in Bologna. The registers of illustrious pupils
</p>
<p>from 1260 to 1300 contains the names of several

</p>
<p>jurists of that school, chief of whom was Jacopo d'
</p>
<p>Albenga. About 1348, Emanuel Fieschi, in order to
</p>
<p>facilitate the studies of his family in that city, founded
</p>
<p>there a perpetual college, and endowed it with a
</p>
<p>liberal income. His nephew Papiniano added largely
</p>
<p>to the endowment.
</p>
<p>When Scipione heard of the events of Genoa, he
</p>
<p>removed to Valdetaro, and from this feud of his family
</p>
<p>wrote to the senate, on the 17th of January, as
</p>
<p>follows :  
</p>
<p>" When I heard of the insurrection in my native
</p>
<p>city I was more dead than alive ; and if the shedding
</p>
<p>of my blood or giving my life could repair the mis-
</p>
<p>fortune, your excellencies may be sure I would not
</p>
<p>shrink from the sacrifice. I have an intense sorrow of
</p>
<p>heart that one of my house should have attempted
</p>
<p>revolution, and especially a revolt against the authority
</p>
<p>of that prince who has always protected and benefited
</p>
<p>our family and to whom I hope always to be a good
</p>
<p>servant. Being most innocent in this conspiracy, I
</p>
<p>pray your excellencies to receive and hold me as a
</p>
<p>good son of the Republic. Such I am and hope always
</p>
<p>to remain, ever willing to expose my life to any peril
</p>
<p>for the public good. I pray you not to abandon me
</p>
<p>as a member of my brother's family, to have compassion
</p>
<p>on my misfortune and not to permit that the fault of
</p>
<p>another shall prejudice me or bring me evil. With a
</p>
<p>heart disturbed and pained by these events beyond

</p>
<p>196 CONSPIRAOY OF GTANLUIGI FIESCHI.
</p>
<p>We shall liereafter see how the senate was affected
</p>
<p>by his pathetic appeal, and how it accepted him as
</p>
<p>a son.
</p>
<p>Doria, indefatigable in the pursuit of revenge,
</p>
<p>instituted search for the corpse of Gianluigi. Few
</p>
<p>believed he wa,s dead, and Doria feared that he had
</p>
<p>escaped into France and was preparing to let loose a
</p>
<p>new tempest upon the government.
</p>
<p>After four days of search, the corpse was found by
</p>
<p>a diver named Pallino. Doria wished to vent his
</p>
<p>wrath and awe the people by suspending the body
</p>
<p>before the gates of the arsenal ; but he did not dare to
</p>
<p>run the risk of a new popular outbreak. The body
</p>
<p>was therefore returned to its grave in the waves. Two
</p>
<p>months after Doria caused it to be fished up again,
</p>
<p>weighted with a mass of stones, carried out and
</p>
<p>launched into the deep sea.
</p>
<p>The vacancy in the office of Doge, created by the
</p>
<p>resignation of Giovanni Battista di Fornari, was filled
</p>
<p>by the election of Bendetto Gentile. Fearing that the
</p>
<p>confederates of Fieschi might renew their insmTcction
</p>
<p>and that it might break out in the very hall of the
</p>
<p>senate, the new Doge forbade the wearing of arms in
</p>
<p>the Ducal palace. At the same time he sent Ceva
</p>
<p>Doria as a legate to Caesar in Germany (the brothers
</p>
<p>Luca and Giovanni Battista Grimaldi were already at
</p>
<p>that court for other business) to inform the emperor
</p>
<p>fully of the perils from which Genoa had escaped and
</p>
<p>to assure him of her constant devotion. Ceva Doria

<p>had secret instructions to ask the consent of Csesar to
</p>
<p>COMPROMISES AND PUNISHMENTS. 197
</p>
<p>tlie absorption of the Fiesclii estates by the Republic.
</p>
<p>The request particularly regarded Varese, Roccatagliata
</p>
<p>and Montobl)i(), in the last of which Count Gerolamo
</p>
<p>was fortified. Ceva Doria was instructed to manage
</p>
<p>the matter with much dexterity. He was to represent
</p>
<p>that Varese and Roccatagliata belonged by ancient
</p>
<p>rights to the Republic and that Montobbio was a cause
</p>
<p>of incessant irritation and frequent danger to the city ;
</p>
<p>that the Republic would be gratified if the emperor
</p>
<p>should wish to honour and reward his faithful servant
</p>
<p>Figueroa with some feud ; that they had already
</p>
<p>occupied Roccatagliata, Varese and Calice and that
</p>
<p>Ferrante Gonzaga had protested, but that Domenico
</p>
<p>Doria, the commissioner of the Republic, had satisfied
</p>
<p>the imperial governor that the occupation was necessary
</p>
<p>to protect these feuds from the Lords of Lando. Ceva
</p>
<p>Doria was also instructed to devise a plan for securing
</p>
<p>the imperial approval to the confiscation of the castles
</p>
<p>of Torriglia and San Stefano.
</p>
<p>When Prince Doria learned of these nesfotiations
</p>
<p>with the emperor, not wishing that the rich estates of
</p>
<p>his enemy should go into other hands than his own he
</p>
<p>sent Francesco Grimaldi to the emperor to oppose the
</p>
<p>wishes of the senate and to obtain the best of the
</p>
<p>Fieschi feuds for himself. He did in the end obtain
</p>
<p>the greater part of this property, as we shall hereafter
</p>
<p>show. Antonio Doria also prayed the Spanish monarch
</p>
<p>to permit him to occupy Santo Stefimo, he having
</p>
<p>bought the Malaspina claims upon the feud. Antonio

<p>at the same time besought the senate to preserve strict
</p>
<p>198 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGI FIESCHI.
</p>
<p>secrecy in tliis negotiation lest the prince should be
</p>
<p>offended on hearing of the intrigue. Ceva Doria com-
</p>
<p>plained strongly of this disagreement between the
</p>
<p>envoy of the Republic and that of Andrea ; particularly
</p>
<p>that Grimaldi preserved a surly and reserved manner
</p>
<p>and refused to communicate anything of importance to
</p>
<p>his colleague.
</p>
<p>The emperor sent Don Rodrigo Mendozza to the
</p>
<p>senate to report his satisfaction at the escape of the
</p>
<p>Republic from such grave perils. He also sent letters
</p>
<p>to Andrea containing solemn assurances that he would
</p>
<p>repair the losses sustained by the prince. At the same
</p>
<p>time he ordered Don Ferrante Gonzaga to proceed to
</p>
<p>the punishment of the Fieschi without a moment's
</p>
<p>delay. The crime for which the imperial governor was
</p>
<p>required to proceed against them was that, being
</p>
<p>vassals of the empire, they had assailed the emperor's
</p>
<p>galleys and admu-als. Gonzaga wrote to the senate
</p>
<p>and to Doria on the subject, but his proceedings did
</p>
<p>not have any result because Andrea and the senate had
</p>
<p>already decreed the utter extermination of the Fieschi.
</p>
<p>Csesar did not, however, content himself with this, and,
</p>
<p>on the 27th of October, 1547, he proclaimed the Fieschi
</p>
<p>as rebels and divested them of all their feuds, which
</p>
<p>he gave to Andrea to be held for the children of
</p>
<p>Gianettino. The cession included Montobbio, Varese,
</p>
<p>Roccatagliata, Valdetaro, Pontremoli and Santo Stefano.
</p>
<p>This first decree did not ta.ke full effect, because the
</p>
<p>Republic had some of the castles in its power, especially

</p>
<p>Gonzaga and surrendered to Gaspare Di Fornari who
</p>
<p>occupied it for the Eepublic.
</p>
<p>Doria was not content with obtaining the greater
</p>
<p>part of the Fieschi feuds. He insisted upon the
</p>
<p>destruction of the sumptuous palace in Vialata and it
</p>
<p>was razed to the foundations. The work of demolition
</p>
<p>was conducted with such angry ha,ste that a great part
</p>
<p>of the walls fell into the gardens of Ambrogio Gazella
</p>
<p>and the Republic paid for the removal of the rubbish.
</p>
<p>A slab of infamy was affixed to a wall near the ruins
</p>
<p>bearing a decree that nothing should ever be built
</p>
<p>upon the ground where a citizen had conspired against
</p>
<p>his country. The inscription no longer exists. The
</p>
<p>tables now in Vialata refer to rights of private property.
</p>
<p>Merciful time has cancelled the records of infamy
</p>
<p>against Gianluigi, though he has preserved them
</p>
<p>against the names of Vacchero, Raggio, Delia Torre
</p>
<p>and Balbi.'" The stone (as we find in a decree of
</p>
<p>1715) was torn down, not by order of the Doge but
</p>
<p>by unknown hands, about 1712, perhaps by some of
</p>
<p>Gianluigi's relatives.
</p>
<p>Ancient tradition tells us that the marbles of the
</p>
<p>Fieschi palace were employed to embellish that of the
</p>
<p>Spinola which was erected on the ruins of the tower
</p>
<p>of the Luccoli. It is that edifice faced with alternate
</p>
<p>black and white marbles which stands on the piazza
</p>
<p>Fontane Morose. We know not whether the tradition

<p>in Genoa two marble slabs bearing inscriptions to the infamy of

<p>be true, but it is certain that the statues in the palace
</p>
<p>of Spinola pertain to the family of its owners. The
</p>
<p>stones and marbles of Vialata were bouo-ht at auction
</p>
<p>by one Antonio Koderio and were scattered. The
</p>
<p>sculptures and other ornaments of the magnificent
</p>
<p>fountain which adorned the garden shared the same
</p>
<p>fate. They were the work of Giovanni Maria di Pasalo
</p>
<p>who, not having been entirely paid for his work by
</p>
<p>Fieschi, received some compensation from the Eepublic.
</p>
<p>The government took possession of the furniture and
</p>
<p>precious vessels which the palace contained not except-
</p>
<p>ing the silver service which according to a memoir of
</p>
<p>Count Gianluigi Mario to the king of France (preserved
</p>
<p>in Beriana) was valued at one hundred thousand
</p>
<p>crowns.
</p>
<p>Nothing remains of the splendid residence of the
</p>
<p>counts but a narrow subterranean passage whose
</p>
<p>architecture is of the fifteenth century. The walls
</p>
<p>are brick and it is covered with slate. Time and damp
</p>
<p>have nearly destroyed it. A branch of it once extended
</p>
<p>to the sea where the battery of Cava was afterwards
</p>
<p>erected, but not a vestige of this part now remains.
</p>
<p>The principal passage led to the valley of Bisagno, out^
</p>
<p>side the gate of the Archi, and served for a means of
</p>
<p>retreat from the city in times of revolution. It is
</p>
<p>probable that this passage furnished Gianluigi with the
</p>
<p>means of introducing into the city, a few days before
</p>
<p>the insurrection, the armed men from his castles.

<p>of the Fieschi palace, but wished to destroy all the

</p>
<p>moiiumonts of the family's greatness. Two houses
</p>
<p>fronting the cathedral were appropriated for the debts
</p>
<p>of Fieschi and thus escaped ruin. The very churches
</p>
<p>were not spared. The arms surmounted by a cardinal's
</p>
<p>hat which Lorenzo Fieschi had placed in Santo Stefano
</p>
<p>in 1499 when Donato Benci, a Florentine sculptor and
</p>
<p>architect, executed some works in that church, were
</p>
<p>now removed. Tlu'oughout the Eastern Riviera, the
</p>
<p>Doria faction glutted their vengeance upon the dwell-
</p>
<p>ings and castles of the Fieschi. In Chiavari they
</p>
<p>publicly tore down and threw into the sea an in-
</p>
<p>scription which attributed the foundation of the church
</p>
<p>of St. Giovanni to Bardone Fieschi.
</p>
<p>Nor were the Dorias alone in hastening the destruc-
</p>
<p>tion of the Fieschi palace. The Sauli whose quarrel
</p>
<p>with the Fieschi we have mentioned, had seen with
</p>
<p>envious eyes the erection of a palace in their neighbour-
</p>
<p>hood which outshone the splendour of their own, and
</p>
<p>they were ambitious of being sole masters of the hill of
</p>
<p>Carignano. There Avere other stimulants to vengeance.
</p>
<p>Popular legends tell us (and we count legends more
</p>
<p>valuable than the breath which scatters them) that the
</p>
<p>Sauli family attended divine service in the church of
</p>
<p>the Fieschi in Vialata. One day Bendinelli Sauli, in a
</p>
<p>friendly manner asked the Fieschi to delay the service
</p>
<p>a little in order that his people might be j^resent. The
</p>
<p>Fieschi responded :  " If you wish to hear mass at

<p>your pleasure, build a church of your own." Sauli

<p>St. George to be left at interest for sixty years and then
</p>
<p>expended in erecting a magnificent church and two
</p>
<p>hospitals in Carignano.
</p>
<p>The descendants of Bendinello, stimulated by old
</p>
<p>and new antipathies, were gratified witnesses of the
</p>
<p>destruction of the mansion of their rivals, and near it
</p>
<p>they erected the church which commemorated the
</p>
<p>bequest of their ancestor. As soon as the palace of
</p>
<p>the Fieschi was destroyed, Galeazzo Alessi was called
</p>
<p>to Genoa and in 1552 he commenced the church of
</p>
<p>Carignano, The superb basilica cost the Sauli a
</p>
<p>hundred thousand gold crowns. It would be a perfect
</p>
<p>monument to their wealth and public spirit, if the front
</p>
<p>were not disfigured by some statues of inferior work-
</p>
<p>manship. They embellished their vengeance by a
</p>
<p>beautiful christian charity which survives the antipa-
</p>
<p>thies out of which it grew. Stefano Sauli, a descendant
</p>
<p>of Bendinello, bequeathed another large legacy to
</p>
<p>construct the massive bridge which conducts to the
</p>
<p>church and unites the two hills.
</p>
<p>But public and private wrath did not fully attain
</p>
<p>their end. A beautiful picture of Gianluigi and

<p>portraits of Verrina and Sacco escaped the vandalism
</p>
<p>of their enemies. In the dark and narrow chapel of

<p>the cathedral near the tomb of the Fieschi family, there

<p>batteries so as to enfilade the redoubts or batter the
</p>
<p>walls. In fact, it often held large armies in check.
</p>
<p>Gianluigi had greatly increased its power of re-
</p>
<p>sistance by employing in his works the science of
</p>
<p>fortifications which was just then invented. The use
</p>
<p>of bastions "with angles dates from that period.
</p>
<p>Giuliano da San Gallo employed them in the fortress
</p>
<p>of Pisa and Andrea Bergauni at Nice. The count
</p>
<p>repaired the curtains and the walls, increasing the
</p>
<p>width to fifteen feet, sloped their sides and constructed
</p>
<p>new bastions. Portions of the walls which had been
</p>
<p>damaged by time were repaired, and new videttes and
</p>
<p>towers were erected on the flanks. The residence of
</p>
<p>the Count was situated on a mass of wall which com-
</p>
<p>manded the whole rock and was protected against both
</p>
<p>internal and external assault.
</p>
<p>The senate saw at once that the obstinacy of the
</p>
<p>count rendered their task a very difiicult one ; and as
</p>
<p>the place was deemed impregnable to assault they set
</p>
<p>about plans for obtaining it by other means. They

</p>
<p>discontent in Italy, and their fears were strengthened
</p>
<p>by the connection of the conspiracy with French
</p>
<p>intrigues and movements. When therefore Fieschi
</p>
<p>declared that he would hold Montobbio for France, his
</p>
<p>enemies did not for a moment doubt that the French
</p>
<p>king would accept a castle so conveniently placed for
</p>
<p>kindling revolutionary fires in Genoa. There was
</p>
<p>therefore a general concert of action among the ad-
</p>
<p>herents of the empire to crush out the spark which
</p>
<p>otherwise might wrap all Italy in flames. Cosimo
</p>
<p>collected his forces in Pisa and put them under the
</p>
<p>command of VitelH. He also ordered the immediate
</p>
<p>return of Stefano Colonna from Rome, put him at the
</p>
<p>head of the Ducal cavalry, and prepared to risk his
</p>
<p>own person in the imperial cause. Gonzaga sent a
</p>
<p>large force to the frontiers of Bobbio under the com-
</p>
<p>mand of Ludovico Yistarino. Even the cardinal of
</p>
<p>Trento sent to Gonzaga to enquire on what point he
</p>
<p>should precipitate six thousand men whom he had
</p>
<p>collected to aid in crushing the Fieschi. Caesar ordered
</p>
<p>Andi-ea to invest Montobbio without a moment's delay,
</p>
<p>offering to furnish the men and money for the siege
</p>
<p>and empowered the admiral to cede Montobbio, Cariseto
</p>
<p>and Varese to the Republic.
</p>
<p>The French were not the only enemies before whom
</p>
<p>Spain trembled. The adherents of Fieschi in Genoa,
</p>
<p>threatened a new outbreak. A rumour ran that
</p>
<p>Gianluigi was not dead, but had gone to Provence to
</p>
<p>collect men and arms, and the fable found such support

<p>in the popular affection for him that it required a long

</p>
<p>time to dissipate the delusion. The plebeians were
</p>
<p>expecting him to come to their deliverance and were
</p>
<p>on the alert to second his first assault on the common
</p>
<p>enemy. Indeed, one night a cry was raised for the
</p>
<p>Adorni (the name was synonymous with popular liberty)
</p>
<p>and the people rushed to arms to the great fright of
</p>
<p>the Dorias. The prince knew the popular faith in
</p>
<p>Gianluigi and had lacked the courage to gibbet his
</p>
<p>body, according to the custom with traitors, lest it
</p>
<p>should raise a popular tempest. Bonfadio, though the
</p>
<p>instrument of the Doria faction, admits this to have
</p>
<p>been Doria s motive for refraining from putting this
</p>
<p>seal of treason on his enemy. The same historian tells
</p>
<p>us that there was a constant peril of a new rising, and
</p>
<p>that to prevent it the city guards were increased and
</p>
<p>eight citizens appointed to suggest to the senate the
</p>
<p>most effectual means of quieting the people and such
</p>
<p>additional laws as would meet the exigencies of the
</p>
<p>occasion.
</p>
<p>Andrea, stimulated by the messages of the emperor
</p>
<p>and by his desire to avenge the blood of Gianettino
</p>
<p>through the extermination of the Fieschi, made in-
</p>
<p>cessant appeals to the government for the storming of
</p>
<p>Montobbio. The senate yielded to these solicitations
</p>
<p>and also empowered Andrea (this we learn from many
</p>
<p>documents) to undertake the operation at his own
</p>
<p>charge and in the name of the emperor. Agostino
</p>
<p>Spinola was ordered to mass his troops and closely
</p>
<p>invest the castle. This soldier and scholar had

</p>
<p>Barnaba Visconti, Bagone and Fregoso attempted to
</p>
<p>revolutionize Genoa. After the expulsion of the
</p>
<p>French, he held a considerable corps of infantry against
</p>
<p>No^d where Origa Gambaro, widow of Pietro Fregosi,
</p>
<p>a woman of intrepid character, maintained the war
</p>
<p>with the aid of French troops. The valour of Spinola
</p>
<p>overcame all obstacles. He opposed courage to
</p>
<p>courage, treachery to treachery; and having allied
</p>
<p>himself with the Cavanna faction in Novi, he defeated
</p>
<p>and destroyed the French army and their leader
</p>
<p>Belforte, and thus restored No^d and Ovada to the
</p>
<p>Republic.
</p>
<p>In the beginning of April 1.547, he collected a con-
</p>
<p>siderable body of men and began to make approaches
</p>
<p>to the castle of Montobljio. To prevent the introduction
</p>
<p>of troops and supf)lies into the fortress he ordered
</p>
<p>Lamba Doria, Bernardo Lomellini and Gabriele
</p>
<p>Moneglia to seize the passes of the Apennines and
</p>
<p>keep close guard on the frontier. Gonzaga rendered
</p>
<p>valuable aid in these operations. He sent captain
</p>
<p>Oriola ^^dth a company of Spanish infantry to Torriglia
</p>
<p>with orders to assist the Genoese generals in divising
</p>
<p>means to approach Montobbio.
</p>
<p>Though the roads were rocky and broken, Spinola
</p>
<p>brought up many guns by the way of the Gioghi and
</p>
<p>along the Scrivia, which is formed l)y the confluence
</p>
<p>of the Laccio and Pantemina under the heights of
</p>
<p>Montobbio. Flippo Doria, who had already acquired

</p>
<p>Francesco and Domenico Doria should have command
</p>
<p>of a body of two thousand infantry. The commissaries
</p>
<p>of the Republic were Cristoforo Grimaldo Rosso, and
</p>
<p>Leonardo Cattaneo, with Domenico De Franchi, and
</p>
<p>Domenico Doria for substitutes.
</p>
<p>Count Gerolamo did not lose courao-e at the sioht of
</p>
<p>these formidable preparations to assail his stronghold,
</p>
<p>but applied himself diligently to increasing his means
</p>
<p>of resistance. He fortified the approaches, repaired
</p>
<p>the cm'tains, videttes and battlements, and added new
</p>
<p>bastions and other works of defence. He had already
</p>
<p>collected a large body of mercenaries and to cover
</p>
<p>Montobbio had garrisoned Cariseto and Varese. He
</p>
<p>asked vainly for the assistance of the French troops in
</p>
<p>Mirandola, and then turned his attention to negotiations
</p>
<p>with Pierluigi Farnese. This duke pretended loyalty
</p>
<p>to the empii'e, but he secretly furnished men and
</p>
<p>supplies, permitted his vassals in the mountains to
</p>
<p>enlist under the standards of Fieschi and instigated the
</p>
<p>people of Valnura and Treljbia to obstruct the passes
</p>
<p>in front of the imperial troops.
</p>
<p>Gerolamo, knowing the worth of Yerrina's advice
</p>
<p>and com^age and the intrepidity of Assereto and the
</p>
<p>band of heroes who had taken refuge in Marseilles,
</p>
<p>sent many messengers to urge them to share with him
</p>
<p>the peril and glory of the siege. These refugees had
</p>
<p>sent Ottobuono and Cornelio Fieschi to the court of

<p>France to plead their cause, and the king had received

<p>them with marks of favour and promised to restore

</p>
<p>frequently, but the French monarch took no steps to
</p>
<p>prove his sincerity. Verrina and Assereto grew weary
</p>
<p>of the tedious delay and accepted the invitation of
</p>
<p>Gcrolamo without awaiting the return of the Fieschi,
</p>
<p>preferring the risk of battle to begging for aid which
</p>
<p>was always promised but never given. They crossed
</p>
<p>Piedmont and found means to enter Montobbio.
</p>
<p>Gerolamo received them with joy and committed the
</p>
<p>defence to their hands. Later, Ottobuono came to
</p>
<p>Mirandola and Verrina and Vicenzo Varese went there
</p>
<p>to aid him in uro;ing the French commander to assist
</p>
<p>in the defence of the castle. They solicited in vain.
</p>
<p>This refusal of France to succour Gerolamo is a new
</p>
<p>proof that Gianluigi had not agreed to deliver Genoa
</p>
<p>into the hands of the French monarch. Francis was
</p>
<p>prodigal of promises, but he left the Fieschi to encounter
</p>
<p>the forces of the empire alone.
</p>
<p>Spinola planted batteries on a height now called
</p>
<p>Costa Rotta near Granara, a village to the west of the
</p>
<p>castle ; but though he bombarded the citadel for forty
</p>
<p>days he was not able to gain one inch of ground, while
</p>
<p>the fire of the fortress mowed down the flower of his
</p>
<p>troops and daily explosions of his own guns added to
</p>
<p>the loss of life. Besides, the inclemency of the season
</p>
<p>and incessant rains prevented the formation of lines of
</p>
<p>circumvallation. The besieged were greatly encouraged,
</p>
<p>and the soldiers of the Republic proportionately de-
</p>
<p>moralized, by these circumstances. On the tenth of

<p>May the podesta of Recco was ordered to send to

<p>men of that commune between the ages of seventeen
</p>
<p>and sixty years.
</p>
<p>On the contrary, Paoh) Moneglia and Manfredo
</p>
<p>Centurione had obtained possession of Varese, with
</p>
<p>little loss of life, through the treachery of its com-
</p>
<p>mandant, Giulio Landi, who surrendered it hoping to
</p>
<p>obtain the investiture of the feud. But this success
</p>
<p>by no means compensated for the losses under the
</p>
<p>walls of Montobl)io. The castle of Cariseto opposed a
</p>
<p>vigorous resistance to the troops of the Republic.
</p>
<p>The people of that feud destroyed the roads, constructed
</p>
<p>fortifications and closed up the passes which led to the
</p>
<p>place. Boniforte Garofolo succeeded at length in
</p>
<p>forcing a path across the rugged summits of the
</p>
<p>surrounding hills and stormed the out-lying defences.
</p>
<p>The attack began at dawn of the 14 th of April. The
</p>
<p>besieged flocked to the parapets, loop-holes and bar-
</p>
<p>bicans, and with their musquetry and cannon held the
</p>
<p>assailants at bay. The battle lasted the entire day.
</p>
<p>On the morrow, the Genoese artillery shattered a large
</p>
<p>tower which fell burying a consideral^le part of the
</p>
<p>defenders under its ruins. This misfortune discouraged
</p>
<p>the rest and they offered to make a conditional sur-
</p>
<p>render of the place. Garofolo demanded a surrender
</p>
<p>at discretion, and the garrison insisted upon security
</p>
<p>for their lives and property, Gian Francesco Niselli,
</p>
<p>a friend of Fieschi and Pierluigi Farnese, was by
</p>
<p>accident in the place at the time of the assault, and he,
</p>
<p>seeing the hoplessness of the defence, sent messengers

<p>to Count Paolo Scotti requesting him to obtain the

<p>212 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGI FIESCHI.
</p>
<p>pevmission of Farncsc for the retreat of the garrison
</p>
<p>into the territory of Piacenza. The duke readily con-
</p>
<p>sented, and the peasants and soldiers effected their
</p>
<p>retreat in the following night. They lit up fires on
</p>
<p>the side of the place which the enemy held and retired
</p>
<p>over broken and difficult foot-paths through the
</p>
<p>mountains.
</p>
<p>The duke had been deeply afiected at the death of
</p>
<p>Gianluigi ; but to avoid a rupture with the emj)ire he
</p>
<p>had sent Ottavio Bajardi to Ferrante Gonzaga, offering
</p>
<p>his troops and even his own person to the imperial
</p>
<p>cause. But he at the same time contrived to have the
</p>
<p>Pope secure him immunity from imperial demands.
</p>
<p>He sent Agostino Landi, count of Compiano, to con-
</p>
<p>gratulate Doria on his escape from the perils which
</p>
<p>had overhung his house and sent back to him a great
</p>
<p>number of fugitive slaves, belonging to the Doria
</p>
<p>galleys, who had taken refuge in the mountains of
</p>
<p>Piacenza. He afterwards sent Salvatore Pocino to the
</p>
<p>emperor to deny charges of complicity with Gianluigi.
</p>
<p>The emperor kncAv all the facts and received the envoy
</p>
<p>with great coldness ; but the duke's son who was in
</p>
<p>the imperial service pleaded more successfully for his
</p>
<p>father.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the large imperial army, which had been
</p>
<p>massed in Varese to support the siege of Montobbio,
</p>
<p>kept the duke in constant apprehension that it might
</p>
<p>be destined to punish him for his treachery. These
</p>
<p>fears were strengthened by the fact that Gonzaga had

<p>added to Vistarino and Oriola five other captains,
</p>
<p>THE CASTLE OF MONTOBBIO. 213
</p>
<p>Sebastiano Picenardi, Lodovico da Borgo, Pier Fran-
</p>
<p>cesco Trecco, Osio Casale and Gianfrancesco Ali, with
</p>
<p>considerable bodies of troops and strict orders to levy
</p>
<p>new recruits in Monticello and Castelvetro, feuds of
</p>
<p>tlie duke. To provide for tlie danger, Farnese, who
</p>
<p>had Cornelio Fieschi under his protection, reorganized
</p>
<p>the army of twelve thousand infantry which he had
</p>
<p>collected in January at Cortemaggiore, sent com-
</p>
<p>missaries to forbid enrolment of imperial troops in his
</p>
<p>feuds, fortified the castles in his jurisdiction, placed six
</p>
<p>hundred infantry at Borgo, a greater number at Bardi
</p>
<p>and ordered Francesco Clerici commanding at Compiano
</p>
<p>to be on the alert and in constant readiness for battle.
</p>
<p>Shortly after he instructed his commissioner in Venice
</p>
<p>to ask the consent of that Republic to his drawing eight
</p>
<p>thousand arquebuses from Brescia. He was allowed
</p>
<p>to draw only five thousand. These operations led to
</p>
<p>reciprocal suspicions, rancours and threats between
</p>
<p>Farnese and the imperial captains, and Gonzaga, to
</p>
<p>prevent an open outbreak, recalled Vistarino from
</p>
<p>Bobbio.
</p>
<p>This measure relieved Farnese from his present peril
</p>
<p>and he resolved to take advantage of the siege of
</p>
<p>Montobbio to get possession, in advance of the imperial
</p>
<p>troops, of some feuds of the Fieschi. He seized
</p>
<p>Calestano, and then sent Gianantonio Torti with a
</p>
<p>strong force to occupy Valditaro. As the Fieschi had
</p>
<p>some imperial vassals in these feuds, Farnese informed
</p>
<p>Gonzaga that he wished to hold them for the interests

</p>
<p>answer, but hurried his troops into the feuds. His
</p>
<p>designs upon Valditaro were thwarted by Scij^ione and
</p>
<p>Cornelio Fieschi, who threw themselves into it with
</p>
<p>about one thousand of their vassals and shut the gates
</p>
<p>in the faces of the Ducal forces. He called Scipione
</p>
<p>to himself in Piacenza and persuaded him that the
</p>
<p>forces of his family were too weak to contend with the
</p>
<p>empire. Scipione consented that the duke should
</p>
<p>occupy the castle in the interest of his family. He
</p>
<p>returned to his vassals and persuaded them to enlist
</p>
<p>in the service of Farnese, who sent his agent, doctor
</p>
<p>Giovanni Landemaria, to take possession in his name.
</p>
<p>The acts of the notary Bartolomeo Bosoni clearly prove
</p>
<p>these facts.
</p>
<p>Gonzaga was enraged at this stratagem of Farnese ;
</p>
<p>and in fact the occupation was of short duration. On
</p>
<p>the death of Farnese, Valditaro was created a principate
</p>
<p>by the emperor and passed to Agostino Landi whose
</p>
<p>ancestors had once held it. The inhabitants always
</p>
<p>retained their love for the Fieschi house, and re-
</p>
<p>membered long the mild government of their old
</p>
<p>masters. They several times conspired to restore
</p>
<p>Scipione who was born among them. In 1552, Gon-
</p>
<p>zaga, incensed at these movements, instigated Landi
</p>
<p>to dismantle the forts and towers lest they should
</p>
<p>afford a place of refuge for the Fieschi.
</p>
<p>More than ten thousand balls had been thrown at
</p>
<p>Montobbio ; but the Fieschi, safe in their defences,
</p>
<p>laughed at the rage of the assailants and their own fire

<p>often seriously damaged the enemy. The people of the

<p>THE CASTLE OF MONTOBBIO. 215
</p>
<p>surrounding country scarcely concealed their sympathy
</p>
<p>for the besieged and furnished the castle with meat
</p>
<p>and provisions of every kind. The commissioners of
</p>
<p>the Republic complained of this and said that the
</p>
<p>inhabitants of Bargagli, Stroppa and other villages
</p>
<p>never brought even an egg to the camp of the Genoese,
</p>
<p>while they gave liberal supplies to the enemy. Spinola,
</p>
<p>despaii'ing of success in the siege, united with the
</p>
<p>commissaries in urging the government to attempt a
</p>
<p>new negotiation.
</p>
<p>At this time Doria learned of the death of kino"
</p>
<p>o
</p>
<p>Francis, and this event removed all apprehension that
</p>
<p>the French would relieve Montobbio and attack the
</p>
<p>Spanish power in Italy. The recent victory of the
</p>
<p>emperor over Frederick of Saxony at Elbe stimulated
</p>
<p>Andrea to a more enthusiastic support of the imperial
</p>
<p>cause and to make a vigorous opposition to the pro-
</p>
<p>posals of accommodation which the senate assembled
</p>
<p>to discuss. He declaimed wrathfully against the
</p>
<p>shameful cowardice of making terms with traitors and
</p>
<p>declared that the Fieschi could hope nothing from
</p>
<p>France, because the new king Hemy II. could not, if
</p>
<p>he wished it, devote any attention in the first month of
</p>
<p>his reign to the petty concerns of Montol3bio and its
</p>
<p>handful of defenders. Though the majority of the
</p>
<p>senate favoured a treaty with Gerolamo, the powerful
</p>
<p>wdll of Doria prevailed and new troops were sent to
</p>
<p>Spinola. The prince sent to the duke of Florence for

<p>infantry under Paolo da Castello ; Ferrante Gonzaga
</p>
<p>sent two companies of four hundred arquebusiers,
</p>
<p>Filippo Doria was ordered by Andrea to make new
</p>
<p>surveys of the lieiglits around Montobbio and to

<p>endeavour to place his artillery in better positions,
</p>
<p>and this general moved his guns to the less elevated
</p>
<p>hciaht called Olmeto in our time and renewed the

<p>attack.
</p>
<p>This bombardment produced no better results than
</p>
<p>the first one and the sico;e must have failed had not

<p>fortune oj)ened a new and easier road to victory. A
</p>
<p>general order forbade any person not in the army to
</p>
<p>approach within two miles of the bastions under penalty
</p>
<p>of death. One day a soldier of the garrison dressed as
</p>
<p>a mountaineer was arrested in the act of examining
</p>
<p>the works of the besiegers, and on his person were
</p>
<p>found letters of Gerolamo to his brother Ottobuono.

<p>In these letters the count declared that he could not

<p>and he urged Ottobuono to secure the immediate aid

<p>seduced him by splendid promises, sent him back to

</p>
<p>This intelligence greatly dispiiited the garrison, in
</p>
<p>whom the want of supplies and the obstinate courage
</p>
<p>of the besiegers were beginning to produce apprehension.
</p>
<p>But desperation lent them new strength and they made
</p>
<p>several bold sorties which seriously damaged the enemy.
</p>
<p>To the want of supplies, a new and more dangerous
</p>
<p>evil was soon added. The mercenaries collected by
</p>
<p>Fieschi in the neighbouring feuds, being poorly fed and
</p>
<p>receiving no pay, began to murmur and finally refused
</p>
<p>to expose themselves to further peril. The count found
</p>
<p>that his own life was threatened by these rebellious
</p>
<p>soldiers, and in letters written on the 20th of March
</p>
<p>to Gian Maria Manara in Valditaro he asked ten faitliful
</p>
<p>men to serve as a guard of his own person. Manara
</p>
<p>was a physician by profession and had so much in-
</p>
<p>fluence with the Fieschi that they had left him to
</p>
<p>govern at pleasure the whole valley of the Taro. He
</p>
<p>furnished the men and obtained other reenforcements
</p>
<p>from captain Mengo da Montedoglio who commanded
</p>
<p>in Valditaro for Farnese, Gerolamo also sent a
</p>
<p>messenger to Cardinal Farnese to ask asylum in the
</p>
<p>church of that prelate in case he should be reduced to
</p>
<p>extremities. In this he was successful, and the cardinal
</p>
<p>also wrote to the Duke of Piacenza to give Gerolamo
</p>
<p>all possible aid.
</p>
<p>During the first days of May the siege was pro-
</p>
<p>secuted with increased vigour. The artillery of Filippo
</p>
<p>Doria poured a storm of shot into the castle,the walls
</p>
<p>fell down in large pieces and the outer curtains were

<p>ruined. There were many indications that the re-

</p>
<p>sistance could not long continue. Still, the subor-
</p>
<p>dinates of Gerolamo restored during the night the
</p>
<p>damage caused hy the Ligurian and Florentine guns
</p>
<p>during the day and there was no sign of discourage-
</p>
<p>ment in the intrepid leaders. But the mercenaries
</p>
<p>continued to murmur and to refuse obedience to the
</p>
<p>commanders, complaining of their privations and
</p>
<p>demanding their wages. The count saw that it was
</p>
<p>necessary to surrender. Gerolamo Garaventa and
</p>
<p>Tommaso Assereto went to the camp of Spinola and
</p>
<p>offered to yield the place but on terms which the
</p>
<p>victors would not accept.
</p>
<p>The Genoese general resolved to make a final assault
</p>
<p>upon the work. He sent trumpeters to proclaim that
</p>
<p>all who wished to save their lives must come within
</p>
<p>his lines ; all who resisted the assault would be put to
</p>
<p>the sword. But though they had been many days in
</p>
<p>great privation, only two of the soldiers of Fieschi
</p>
<p>obeyed the summons. The assault was begun with
</p>
<p>great fury and, added to the discontent of the merce-
</p>
<p>naries, convinced Fieschi that he must surrender at
</p>
<p>once. He ofi'ered Spinola the castle on condition that
</p>
<p>the lives and goods of the defenders should be
</p>
<p>respected.
</p>
<p>The senate met in Genoa to consider this proposition
</p>
<p>and the debate shows that the Fieschi had many
</p>
<p>sympathizers in the senate and that Andrea Doria was
</p>
<p>the real .master of the Eepublic. After two days of
</p>
<p>discussion the senate resolved to accept the offers of
</p>
<p>Fieschi.* The count, who knew how little value the

<p>pledges of the government really possessed, asked to
</p>
<p>be secured against the vengeance of Andrea Doria.
</p>
<p>The senate promised to secure the assent of Andrea to
</p>
<p>the negotiation and applied to him for the purpose.
</p>
<p>But the prince, who knew that Gerolamo was now in
</p>
<p>his power, refused his cooperation and the senate had
</p>
<p>not the courage to maintain their position.
</p>
<p>The garrison at Montobbio were greatly distressed
</p>
<p>by this attitude of Doria. All means of obtaining
</p>
<p>provisions were cut off, and they must soon be reduced
</p>
<p>by starvation. Still, they held a bold front to the
</p>
<p>enemy and resolved to die fighting rather than
</p>
<p>surrender at discretion. But the mercenaries broke
</p>
<p>into open rebellion and the more desperate, after
</p>
<p>demanding their pay on the instant, seized a tower
</p>
<p>which had hitherto defied all the enemy's guns and
</p>
<p>surrendered it to the soldiers of the Kepublic. The
</p>
<p>count and his faithful soldiers were obliged to take
</p>
<p>shelter in a wing of the fortress. The treason of the
</p>
<p>adventurers (which is spoken of not only in inedited
</p>
<p>documents but also by Adriani) took away all hope
</p>
<p>from the defenders. They resolved to imitate the
</p>
<p>garrison of Cariseto and retire by night over the rugged
</p>
<p>and almost inaccessible heights in their rear. But
</p>
<p>Vicenzo Calcagno reminded them that the count, who
</p>
<p>was corpulent of body, would not be able to make so
</p>
<p>fatiguing a march over wild mountain paths and that
</p>
<p>the troops of Doria held all the passes behind them.

</p>
<p>foot-paths they were surroiinded and forced to sur-
</p>
<p>render. The count who still ho2:)ed that the Republic
</p>
<p>would make good its promises yielded the castle to
</p>
<p>Spinola, who entered it with flying banners on the
</p>
<p>morning of the 11th of June.
</p>
<p>Spinola, as a faithful servant of Andrea, ordered his
</p>
<p>Corsicans as soon as he had taken possession of the
</p>
<p>works to execute Calcagno, Manara and some other
</p>
<p>partisans of the count suspected of having participated
</p>
<p>in the murder of Gianettino. Domenico Doria, il Con-
</p>
<p>verso, also made some executions. The rest, including
</p>
<p>the mercenaries, were held as prisoners of war. But
</p>
<p>these last only were permitted to depart on parole.
</p>
<p>Count Gerolamo, Verrina and Assereto were reserved
</p>
<p>for public execution in the city and were treated with
</p>
<p>great inhumanity.
</p>
<p>At the news of the surrender of Montobbio, the
</p>
<p>senate again assembled. Most of the senators held
</p>
<p>that one of the first families of Italy, bound by re-
</p>
<p>lationship) to the most illustrious houses, ought not to
</p>
<p>be plunged into deeper calamity. They plead with

<p>Doria. The Fieschi had been sufficiently punished by

<p>the confiscation of their property, the destruction of
</p>
<p>their houses and the death of Gianluigi. \Vhy vent

<p>heart to more generous, to more magnanimous counsels.
</p>
<p>Let him imitate the example of Csesar who would not
</p>
<p>condemn to death tlie Saxon whom he had conquered
</p>
<p>in battle.
</p>
<p>Doria was deaf to these appeals of the senators. He
</p>
<p>refused all compromises. The Fieschi and . their com-
</p>
<p>panions must die. The writers in the Doria interest
</p>
<p>do not disguise this fact. Mascardi says : 
</p>
<p>*' Those who favoured clemency were in the majority.
</p>
<p>They urged that forbearance was a necessary quality
</p>
<p>in governments, that the violence of Gianluigi mitigated
</p>
<p>the guilt of his confederates and that the youth of his
</p>
<p>brothers ought to extenuate their offence. Andrea
</p>
<p>Doria was greatly displeased to see the Republic so
</p>
<p>basely betrayed, and going into the senate he spoke
</p>
<p>with so much force and authority that the unfortunate
</p>
<p>men were condemned to death."
</p>
<p>In the monastery of St. Andrea della Porta lived a
</p>
<p>sister of the Fieschi named Suor Angela Catterina.
</p>
<p>She imitated the example of the two pious women in
</p>
<p>her family, of whom we have elsewhere spoken, and she
</p>
<p>was held in hig;li esteem. As soon as she heard of the
</p>
<p>condemnation of her brother, Gerolamo, she made the
</p>
<p>most earnest supplications to the government on his
</p>
<p>behalf.
</p>
<p>" I could not," said the afflicted sister, " abandon a
</p>
<p>brother in such a terrible calamity. That God, whom
</p>
<p>human judges ought to imitate, is compassionate as
</p>
<p>well as just with sinners. Senators should remember

<p>brother without any previous knowledge of his in-
</p>
<p>tentions, and, that he himself has never plotted against
</p>
<p>the Republic, that he surrendered Montobbio with the
</p>
<p>confident expectation that the senate would spare his
</p>
<p>life. The senate should keep faith and pardon this son
</p>
<p>of Sinibaldo one of the warmest advocates and defenders
</p>
<p>of the union and liberty of the country. Let them
</p>
<p>remember what Christ said : ' Blessed are the merciful,
</p>
<p>for they shall obtain mercy ;' almost beside myself with
</p>
<p>grief and more dead than alive, I fall at the feet of the
</p>
<p>prince and conjure him by the mercy of Christ to
</p>
<p>pardon my poor brother." It was in vain. She was
</p>
<p>encouraged to hope, but the pardon never came. The
</p>
<p>senate had not the courage to take the victim out of
</p>
<p>the hands of Doria.
</p>
<p>The populace was still agitated and full of seditious
</p>
<p>plans. Though a deep mystery enveloped the action
</p>
<p>of the government, the people suspected the vindictive
</p>
<p>intention of Doria and threatened revolt. This led
</p>
<p>the government to transfer the execution from Genoa
</p>
<p>to Montobbio. Two priests were at once despatched
</p>
<p>to the castle, Gian Maria Paulocio, one of the officers
</p>
<p>of the Ruota, and Tommaso Doria, to examine the
</p>
<p>prisoners and report theu- defence to the senate.
</p>
<p>Soon after the Fodesta for criminal cases was also

<p>sent, under decree of the 4th of July. This was

</p>
<p>means to escape this painful office, and we learn from
</p>
<p>some letters of liis to the senate that he had protested
</p>
<p>against being commissioned for the examination.
</p>
<p>The Republic had begun by declaring the Fieschi
</p>
<p>guilty of high treason and denying them trial or
</p>
<p>defence. He subsequently wrote to the senate : " If
</p>
<p>your excellencies do not make some change, I shall be
</p>
<p>in a very painful position and people may justly think
</p>
<p>that I prosecute this unfortunate affair (maladetta
</p>
<p>causa) with personal motives. You know how I
</p>
<p>laboured to relieve myself from this duty. Therefore
</p>
<p>I beseech you to reheve me at once from my present
</p>
<p>embarrassment by declaring clearly that we may admit
</p>
<p>new testimony, or by revoking your second decree, and
</p>
<p>proceeding logically by carrying out your first exe-
</p>
<p>cutive mandate." The senate solved the difficulty by
</p>
<p>ordering the punishment of the prisoners without trial.
</p>
<p>The common soldiers were pardoned. Some of the
</p>
<p>conspirators were condemned to the halter, others to
</p>
<p>the oar.
</p>
<p>The sentence was executed on the 23rd of July.
</p>
<p>Desiderio Cangialanza was the first to mount the
</p>
<p>scafibld and he was followed by some whose names
</p>
<p>history has not preserved. It was too busy with
</p>
<p>laudations of Doria and invectives against the fallen.
</p>
<p>Gerolamo, Verrina and Assereto, being patricians,
</p>
<p>were beheaded in the chapel of San Rocco at the foot
</p>
<p>of the fortress. Servile as was the age it was forced
</p>
<p>to admire the heroic bearing of Verrina whose character

<p>was cast in the old Roman mould. He was twice
</p>
<p>224 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGI FIESCHI.
</p>
<p>tortured, but he would not utter a word about the
</p>
<p>secrets of the conspii-acy. The night preceeding his
</p>
<p>execution he spoke mth serenity of the doctrines to
</p>
<p>which he had given his faith, and encouraged his
</p>
<p>companions to meet their last hour with courageous
</p>
<p>composure. He went to the scaffold with the step
</p>
<p>rather of a conqueror than of a criminal.
</p>
<p>The sentence of death embraced the exiles Ottobuono
</p>
<p>and Cornelio, and, what is more iniquitous, the youthful
</p>
<p>Scipione and his descendants to the fifth generation
</p>
<p>were banished. Some writers have maintained that
</p>
<p>Sacco was also executed at IMontobbio. But though
</p>
<p>the documents relating to the treaty with Gerolamo
</p>
<p>are few and it is apparent that many have been
</p>
<p>surreptitiously removed from the public archives, yet
</p>
<p>we have been so fortunate as to find some letters of
</p>
<p>Sacco himself which entirely invalidate this statement.
</p>
<p>Another person has already printed some of them.
</p>
<p>His correspondence with Luigi Ferrero of Savona, in
</p>
<p>February, show that he was then in Turin on his way
</p>
<p>back from France.
</p>
<p>In Tm-in he Avas befriended by presidents Catto and
</p>
<p>Birago. The latter concealed him in one of his own
</p>
<p>houses on the banks of the Po. He had friends, kept
</p>
<p>up party affiliations, and hoped that the recent death
</p>
<p>of the English monarch would occasion a war in Italy.
</p>
<p>In other letters, addressed to his wife Alessandra, he
</p>
<p>alludes to his hope of French interference and expresses
</p>
<p>an intention of returning to that court. He gives her

<p>commends her to Nicol6 Doria, Antonio De Fornari
</p>
<p>and Giovanni Gerolamo Salvago. There is a letter to
</p>
<p>count Gerolamo Fieschi in which he asks a hundred
</p>
<p>crowns and letters of recommendations to the king of
</p>
<p>France, Delfino, the admiral and the cardinals Tornone
</p>
<p>and Ferrara. He exhorts the count to be diligent in
</p>
<p>furnishing his fortresses and to put on a bold front in
</p>
<p>order to discourage his enemies and inspirit his friends.
</p>
<p>The records of the trial show that the Ferrero gave
</p>
<p>these letters to the senate. The most important of
</p>
<p>these epistles is the one written in July to Pietro
</p>
<p>Francesco Grimaldi Robio, doctor of the college of
</p>
<p>judges, in which he exculpates himself from the charge
</p>
<p>made by Verrina of having been the first instigator of
</p>
<p>the conspiracy. He shows that Verrina had been the
</p>
<p>beginning, middle and end of the plot. He says that
</p>
<p>if Calcagno were alive, he would fully exculpate him
</p>
<p>from the accusations ; but as this person was dead it
</p>
<p>only remained for him to recite all the facts of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy. This history he says will show him to
</p>
<p>have been innocent. His only fault was that he
</p>
<p>had been born in Savona. Had he been a Genoese
</p>
<p>he would have communicated his first knowledge of
</p>
<p>the plot to the senate and thus escaped condemnation,
</p>
<p>or be as lightly punished as many of his present
</p>
<p>accusers. He admits that he concealed the conspiracy
</p>
<p>but asks : " Ought I to have denounced the count my
</p>
<p>master and exposed him to death and infamy ? If this

<p>silence is a fault, I do not hesitate to accept the

<p>and I repeat, that if the senate will send to Turin a
</p>
<p>person in whom they have confidence I will recite the
</p>
<p>whole story of the plot. I do not say this to beg

<p>pardon for what I have done, but to disprove unjust
</p>
<p>charges heaped upon my name." These are the
</p>
<p>customary phrases of informers.
</p>
<p>These papers show that Sacco was not involved in
</p>
<p>the condemnation of his accomplices. For the rest,
</p>
<p>we are not permitted to know what was the nature of
</p>
<p>his revelations, because the most important papers of
</p>
<p>this trial are wanting. We believe, however, that
</p>
<p>some mutilated documents refer to this matter. We
</p>
<p>learn from them that a certain Filippo di Graveggia
</p>
<p>carried letters under the saddle of a mule to Parma,
</p>
<p>Bologna and other cities.
</p>
<p>Ha\dng restored order, the government informed its
</p>
<p>friends of the taking of Montobbio, especially Duke
</p>
<p>Cosimo whose aid had been so valuable to the besiegers.
</p>
<p>But there were ominous signs of discontent in all

<p>The government sent Tommaso Spinola and Antonio

<p>business was to spy out the movements of the Fieschi

</p>
<p>it should be levelled with the earth, " so that," said the
</p>
<p>proclamation, "no evidence may remain that any
</p>
<p>fortification has ever existed there." Even the brow
</p>
<p>of the mountain was ordered to be thrown into the
</p>
<p>valley so that no castle could ever be erected on the
</p>
<p>site. Whoever should attempt to build there was
</p>
<p>declared a rebel and his goods confiscated to the state.
</p>
<p>Prince Doria assumed the charge of this demolition,
</p>
<p>but the expense was borne by the Republic. Giovanni
</p>
<p>Bozzo, podesta of Montobbio, reported on the 10th of
</p>
<p>August that Paolo di Mirandola had excavated three
</p>
<p>mines under the castle, one on the East side seventy-
</p>
<p>six palms in length with openings at the two sides ;
</p>
<p>the second, on the South, ran twenty palms into the
</p>
<p>mountain from the bank of the stream, the third, on
</p>
<p>the West side where the principal battery had stood,
</p>
<p>penetrated a distance of ten palms. Mirandola, he
</p>
<p>reports, declared that the mines must be extended as
</p>
<p>the castle had the strength of steel. The explosion of
</p>
<p>these mines blew the whole work to the ground re-
</p>
<p>ducing it at once to a total ruin.

<p>In our time even the face of nature is changed.

<p>Wild weeds grow on that slope where gardens once

<p>bloomed. The daffodils which breathe their perfume

<p>over the place are the only witnesses to ancient culture.

<p>A beautiful lake which lay at the foot of the castle has

<p>disappeared. It probably covered a spot to which

<p>tradition gives the name Lago delta Signora.

</p>
<p>The office of liistorian becomes a painful one when
</p>
<p>we are required to describe some of the actions of
</p>
<p>Andrea Doria, actions which throw a shade over his
</p>
<p>fame, and take away a part of his laurels from the
</p>
<p>greatest admiral of Italy. It is a work of simple
</p>
<p>devotion to truth to show that Andrea maintained the
</p>
<p>Spanish power in the Peninsula, and that he over-
</p>
<p>stepped all bounds in his rage against the defeated
</p>
<p>Fieschi. Sismondi says that the prince in destroying
</p>
<p>his enemies to avenge Gianettino went to lengths of
</p>
<p>ferocity unworthy of a great man.
</p>
<p>He had applied to himself that saying of Lorenzo
</p>
<p>di Medici : " While there are Gatti in Genoa the
</p>
<p>Republic will never have peace, and perhaps on this
</p>
<p>account found it easier to obtain Medicean aid in
</p>
<p>exterminating these Gatti." At all events he gave
</p>
<p>himself no rest while the work of destruction remained
</p>
<p>incomplete. He embraced in his scheme of vengeance

<p>the Strozzi and their allies.
</p>
<p>PIER LUIGI FARNESE. 229
</p>
<p>The activity of Andrea was wonderful. Wherever
</p>
<p>he had representatives, public or private, thither flew
</p>
<p>his messages and messengers. He neglected nothing
</p>
<p>at home or abroad. Politics, arms, arts, commerce 
</p>
<p>he had his eye on everything  on the exiles especially.
</p>
<p>Aided by Cosimo, he set an assassin named Bastiano
</p>
<p>da Finale to dodge the steps of Piero Strozzi who was
</p>
<p>marching to Siena. He employed seven assassins to
</p>
<p>murder Ottobuono, Scipione and Cornelio Fieschi. We
</p>
<p>learn from Venitian letters preserved in the Tuscan
</p>
<p>archives that one of these wretches accompanied by
</p>
<p>two companions went several times to Venice to
</p>
<p>assassinate the brothers of Gianluigi. This corres-
</p>
<p>pondence relates that this assassin was artfully banished
</p>
<p>from Genoa as a popular conspirator, as a means of
</p>
<p>giving him access to the Genoese exiles, though he was
</p>
<p>secretly recommended by Doria to the ambassador of
</p>
<p>the emperor. Doria would have better provided for
</p>
<p>his fame if, content with depriving the Fieschi of the
</p>
<p>means of revolution, he had declined the services of
</p>
<p>bravos and refused the price of blood so lavishly offered
</p>
<p>by the emperor.
</p>
<p>After the capture of Montobbio, Doria, under orders
</p>
<p>from Caesar invested the Kepublic (February 29th
</p>
<p>1548) with the feuds of that place, of Varese and
</p>
<p>Roccatagliata, Cristoforo Lercaro had already occupied
</p>
<p>the last in the name of Genoa. The cession was made
</p>
<p>to appear as a gift, though the Republic already
</p>
<p>possessed the right of eminent domain over Rocca-

<p>Milan held fast to Pontremoli, in order, as Doria
</p>
<p>advised, to keep that strong post then the key of the
</p>
<p>Lombard provinces, in imperial hands. Gonzaga also
</p>
<p>occuj)ied Loano, Carrega, Grondona, Borbagia, San
</p>
<p>Stefano d' A veto, Calice, Veppo and other castles, a part
</p>
<p>of which Charles (June 19th 1548) gave in feud to
</p>
<p>various partisans of the empire. This was not imperial
</p>
<p>munificence, but king-craft and a device to strengthen
</p>
<p>the Spanish power in Liguria. Andrea obtained some
</p>
<p>wealthy feuds, among them Torriglia, (which was
</p>
<p>erected into a marquisate) Carrega, Garbagna, Grondona
</p>
<p>and ten other castles. San Stefano d' Aveto was ceded
</p>
<p>to Antonio Doria who was hiring four galleys to the
</p>
<p>empire. Ettore Fieschi, of the Savignone branch,
</p>
<p>received some feuds as a reward for not having shared
</p>
<p>in the conspkacy of his relatives. The castle of
</p>
<p>Castelano was ceded to the Duke of Parma. Agostino
</p>
<p>Landi retained the burgh of Valditaro. This Landi
</p>
<p>had promised to assassinate Pierluigi Farnese whom
</p>
<p>Doria had condemned to death for his secret intrigues
</p>
<p>with Gianluigi. It is worth our while to clear up the
</p>
<p>history of this part of Andrea's vengeance.
</p>
<p>The cities of Parma and Piacenza, having been
</p>
<p>detached from the duchy of Milan and put into the
</p>
<p>hands of the Holy See, were ceded by Paul III. to his
</p>
<p>natural son Pier Luigi Farnese who had been legiti-
</p>
<p>mated in 1501 by Julius II. To secure his son in this
</p>
<p>new duchy, the Pope supported Charles in the German
</p>
<p>war and in his expedition to Tunis, where, aided

<p>by Doria the emperor restored the inhuman Muley-
</p>
<p>PIER LUIGI FARNESE. 231
</p>
<p>Hassan to the throne which he mounted by the assassi-
</p>
<p>nation of his twenty-two brothers. The alliance of
</p>
<p>Farnese with the empire was cemented by the marriage
</p>
<p>of Pierluigi's son, Ottavio, with Margaret a natural
</p>
<p>daughter of Csesar and widow of Alessandro de Medici.
</p>
<p>Francis Sforza died and the duchy of Milan reverted
</p>
<p>to the empire giving rise to a war with France. The
</p>
<p>Pope thought to gain profit for Pier Luigi out of this
</p>
<p>contest for the duchy by securing him the investiture,
</p>
<p>and Caesar, at the conference of Busseto, promised to
</p>
<p>grant the pontiff's request. The emperor did not keep
</p>
<p>his pledge and the Pope began to abandon the imperial
</p>
<p>cause. He reproached Charles with the fact that
</p>
<p>certain prelates devoted to the empire had proposed in
</p>
<p>the council of Trent innovations on the rights of the
</p>
<p>Papal See, and expressed his discontent with the mild
</p>
<p>treatment of the partisans of Luther in Germany. He
</p>
<p>went further and began to intrigue, in 1547, for a
</p>
<p>league with France ao;ainst Charles.
</p>
<p>Francis I. at the moment when he was most zealously
</p>
<p>engaged in uniting England, Germany and Italy
</p>
<p>against Spain was stricken by death at Rambouillet
</p>
<p>after a twenty years' conflict with the increasing power
</p>
<p>of Charles Fifth. The emperor now saw himself with-
</p>
<p>out a rival and hastened to take advantage of the
</p>
<p>occasion. He renewed hostilities against the Duke of
</p>
<p>Saxony, though his army had been thinned by the
</p>
<p>withdrawal of the Papal troops. It is not our purpose
</p>
<p>to recount the story of this Germanic war. Charles

</p>
<p>conducted it to a successful termination because the
</p>
<p>232 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGI FIESCHI.
</p>
<p>affairs of Italy no longer distracted his attention. But
</p>
<p>his victories over the league of Smacalda increased the
</p>
<p>suspicions and fears of Paul III. who saw that if
</p>
<p>Charles was successful in Germany he would be master
</p>
<p>at the council of Trent. It was no secret that the
</p>
<p>en;peror designed to take that occasion for avenging
</p>
<p>himself on the Pope for sympathy with the Fieschi
</p>
<p>and France. The Roman court was too jealous of its
</p>
<p>prerogatives not to be alarmed at the prospect of
</p>
<p>having its power limited by an ambitious monarch
</p>
<p>favourably disposed towards the policy of the German
</p>
<p>reformers. It was thought necessary to remove the
</p>
<p>seat of the council to some city nearer to Rome
</p>
<p>and more under Papal influence, where Charles
</p>
<p>could not intrigue nor display his arms with so much
</p>
<p>effect.
</p>
<p>Fortune favoured the Pope. Some of the assembled
</p>
<p>prelates fell sick and the physicians, especially Fra-
</p>
<p>castoro who was employed by Rome for the business,
</p>
<p>reported that a fierce contagion had broken out in the
</p>
<p>city. Many of the prelates abandoned Trent in great
</p>
<p>haste and the council was removed to Bologna. The
</p>
<p>cardinals and bishops of the imperial faction remained
</p>
<p>in Trent by express order of Charles. The remainder,
</p>
<p>thirty-four in number, accompanied the Papal legates.
</p>
<p>There were mutual recriminations and the very council
</p>
<p>assembled to destroy seism was menaced with a seism
</p>
<p>in its own bosom.
</p>
<p>Csesar made angry appeals and intrigued adroitly to

<p>secure the reassembling of the Synod in Trent. The
</p>
<p>PIER LUIGI FARNESE. 233
</p>
<p>Pope refused, and Charles avenged himself by that
</p>
<p>decree of Interim, in which he declared that until
</p>
<p>the council should be reconvoked in Trent every
</p>
<p>one was at liberty to think as he pleased in matters
</p>
<p>of religion. The decree occasioned great scandal in
</p>
<p>the church.
</p>
<p>" It was believed," says Varchi, " that the emperor
</p>
<p>wished to restore the Papacy to the simplicity and
</p>
<p>poverty of times when prelates did not meddle with
</p>
<p>temporal government but contented themselves with
</p>
<p>their spiritual functions. The gross abuses and vile
</p>
<p>practices of the Roman court had awakened in many
</p>
<p>an ardent desire for such a reform." This gave
</p>
<p>bitterness to the enmity between the Pope and Charles.
</p>
<p>The pontiff directed his hostilities especially against
</p>
<p>the two imperial ministers in Italy, Anotonio Leyva
</p>
<p>and Andrea Doria, On the death of the first, the whole
</p>
<p>weight of Papal displeasure fell on the head of the
</p>
<p>latter, who earlier in life had received from Rome a
</p>
<p>consecrated sword and hat for his victories over the
</p>
<p>Turks. We have elsewhere shown how the opposition
</p>
<p>of Doria to the growth of the Farnese family and his
</p>
<p>other acts hostile to Paul III., had led the latter to
</p>
<p>favour the Fieschi conspiracy against Doria and Spain.
</p>
<p>Some deny that Paul favoured the conspirators and
</p>
<p>adduced the testimony of Don Appollonio Filareto,
</p>
<p>secretary to Pier Luigi Farnese. This secretary, though
</p>
<p>confined for three years as a prisoner in Milan and put
</p>
<p>to torture, steadfastly denied that the French knew of

</p>
<p>the plans of Fieschi. But this is contradicted both by
</p>
<p>234 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGl FIESCHI.
</p>
<p>the current opinion of that time and by authentic and
</p>
<p>credible documents extant. Charles was so certain of
</p>
<p>the complicity of the Pope with Fieschi, that when
</p>
<p>Paul sent Camillo Orsino to Madrid to complain to the
</p>
<p>emperor of the murder of his son Pier Luigi and ask
</p>
<p>the restitution of Piacenza to the Apostolic See, he
</p>
<p>boldly charged the pontiff with this crime.
</p>
<p>As soon as Andrea learned through the ministers of
</p>
<p>Caesar that Paul had been concerned in the Fieschi
</p>
<p>movement, and that Pier Luigi had given material aid
</p>
<p>to Gianluigi he was inflamed with an ardent desire to
</p>
<p>punish old and new treacheries by a signal act of
</p>
<p>vengeance. From that hour, Farnese was condemned
</p>
<p>to the fate of the Fieschi. Moreover, in gratifying his
</p>
<p>own passion for revenge, Andrea was furthering the
</p>
<p>schemes of Charles. He launched himself into the
</p>
<p>matter with the ardour of youth.
</p>
<p>The news that Charles was sufl'ering from a mortal
</p>
<p>sickness filled Doria with apprehension of wide-spread
</p>
<p>conspiracy against Spain in case of the emperor's death.
</p>
<p>Pier Luigi, in fiiict, as soon as he received the same
</p>
<p>intelligence, began to raise troops, fortify castles and
</p>
<p>enlist able commanders among whom were Bartolomeo
</p>
<p>Villachiara, Sforza Santa Fiore, Sforza Pallavicino and
</p>
<p>Alessandro Tommasoni da Terni. He collected arms
</p>
<p>everywhere. We find in old documents that he bought
</p>
<p>at one time four thousand arquebuses, for a gold crown
</p>
<p>each, from tlie celebrated Venturino del Chino,
</p>
<p>armourer of Gordone in Valtrompia. Bonfadio tells

<p>us that these military preparations awakened grave
</p>
<p>PIER LUIGI FARNESE. 235
</p>
<p>suspicions in the neighbouring cities of the empire who
</p>
<p>feared that these arms were to be used against them-
</p>
<p>selves. The fear of revolution was widely diffused.
</p>
<p>Doria could not be an idle witness of this drawing of
</p>
<p>swords in places so near, especially after the share of
</p>
<p>Farnese in the Fieschi plot. He had then two motives
</p>
<p>for prompt action ; to secure the safety of the empire
</p>
<p>and to avenge the blood of Gianettino.
</p>
<p>Pier Luigi has been traduced by the malice of
</p>
<p>wiiters in the Spanish interest. It it is true that
</p>
<p>Cellini declares him avaricious, and many historians
</p>
<p>affirm that he was intemperate and a votary of
</p>
<p>licentious pleasures. Even Aretino admonished him
</p>
<p>to husband more carefully the strength of his manhood.
</p>
<p>But the fable of Varchi that he ravished Cosimo
</p>
<p>Gheri, bishop of Fano, though repeated in our days
</p>
<p>has no longer any supporters. It is now beyond
</p>
<p>question that the story began with Pier Paolo Vergerio,
</p>
<p>a malignant slanderer of Farnese. The slander was
</p>
<p>refuted at the time by Bishop Delia Casa in the time
</p>
<p>of Vergerio, and later by Ammiani, Poggiali, Morandi,
</p>
<p>Cardinal Quirino and Apostolo Zeno, not to mention
</p>
<p>many others. Pier Luigi was great by rank and by
</p>
<p>nature. He restrained the arrogance of his nobles and
</p>
<p>had studied much to elevate his people to an equality
</p>
<p>with their lords. He was supported in these plans by
</p>
<p>the distinguished literary men who served as his
</p>
<p>secretaries ; Claudio Tolomei, Giovanni Battista Pico,
</p>
<p>David Spilimbergo, Gandolfo Porrino, Giovanni Paccini,

<p>and Care. The last after the death of his master was
</p>
<p>pursued by assassins and with great difficulty saved
</p>
<p>his life by fleeing into the province of Cremona.
</p>
<p>This open friendship of Farnese for the people, at a
</p>
<p>time when the lords were everywhere practising great
</p>
<p>severity, added to the hatred of the imperial agents
</p>
<p>and whetted their desire for vengeance. There was
</p>
<p>still another cause of quarrel. The port of the Po at
</p>
<p>Piacenza had been ceded by Paul III. to the divine
</p>
<p>Bonarotti (taking away certain rights upon it from the
</p>
<p>Pusterla and Trivulzio) and Bonarotti had rented it to
</p>
<p>Francesco Durante, and the nobles taking the sides of
</p>
<p>the defrauded parties resolved to wreak their vengeance
</p>
<p>on the pontifl"'s son. A conspiracy was formed at the
</p>
<p>head of which were Giovanni Anguissola, Camillo and
</p>
<p>Gerolamo Pallavicini and Giovanni Confaloniere. But
</p>
<p>the soul of the plot was count Agostino Landi, the
</p>
<p>same person who informed the government at Lucca
</p>
<p>of the conspiracy of Pietro Fatinelli, and thus betrayed
</p>
<p>him to death.
</p>
<p>Andrea opened his heart to Landi and showed him
</p>
<p>the golden promises of Csesar. Casoni relates this and
</p>
<p>he founded it upon irrefragible proofs which he had
</p>
<p>in his hands. He adds that the prince pledged to
</p>
<p>Landi the hand of the sister of Gianettino for his son
</p>
<p>with a wealthy dowry. This marriage afterwards took
</p>
<p>place. It was important that, after the assassination
</p>
<p>of the duke, the duchy of Piacenza should revert to
</p>
<p>the empire, and to secure this result Doria intrigued

</p>
<p>and Busseto, whose mother and wife had been held in
</p>
<p>captivity by Farnese and who was therefore anxious
</p>
<p>to punish the affront. The conspirators in Piacenza
</p>
<p>at first really intended to establish a popular govern-
</p>
<p>ment ; but Doria adroitly induced them to communicate
</p>
<p>with Gonzaga. It was not difficult then to secure the
</p>
<p>subjection of Piacenza to the empire.
</p>
<p>A warm animosity burned between Gonzaga and the
</p>
<p>duke on account of the priorship of Barletta which
</p>
<p>Gonzaga had obtained for his son to the exclusion of
</p>
<p>Horace Farnese. Gonzaga made many attempts upon
</p>
<p>the life of Pier Luigi. Annibal Caro, who in July,
</p>
<p>1547 was sent by the latter to Milan informed his
</p>
<p>master of these plots ; but the duke had no presenti-
</p>
<p>ment of his imminent peril. The efforts of Gonzaga,
</p>
<p>however, all failed, and with the knowledge of Charles,
</p>
<p>he sent captain Federico Gazzino to order the con-
</p>
<p>spirators to proceed with their work.
</p>
<p>On the tenth of December 1547 Giovanni Anguissola
</p>
<p>went to the castle which Farnese had erected to
</p>
<p>command the city and demanded instant speech of the
</p>
<p>duke on matters of pressing urgency. Having entered,
</p>
<p>Anguissola and his friend Giovanni Valentino threw
</p>
<p>themselves upon the duke and killed him with stabs
</p>
<p>in his face and breast. On leaving the apartment, the
</p>
<p>assassin killed a priest and a servant who were rushing
</p>
<p>in to ascertain the occasion of the duke's cries, struck
</p>
<p>down a German lancer who threw himself before him
</p>
<p>and ran to rejoin his fellow conspirators, who, led by

</p>
<p>Confaloniere immediately overpowered the garrison of
</p>
<p>238 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGI FIESCHI.
</p>
<p>the citadel. Others, headed by Landi and the Palla-
</p>
<p>vicini brothers, attacked and soon captured the castle
</p>
<p>with but little loss of life. Some mercenaries fleeing
</p>
<p>from the citadel spread a report that the Spaniards had
</p>
<p>attacked the castle ; and the plebians, to whom the
</p>
<p>very name Spaniards was odious, rose in arms, gathered
</p>
<p>around Tommasoni da Terni, captain of the city milita,
</p>
<p>and marched to the citadel to recover it by storm.
</p>
<p>The battle could not have been long or doubtful ; for
</p>
<p>only thirty-seven conspirators were in possession of the
</p>
<p>fortress. But they invented an expedient which served
</p>
<p>them in the stead of force. They hung the corpse of
</p>
<p>the duke to the wall and afterwards threw it into the
</p>
<p>moat. The sight destroyed the hopes of the people.
</p>
<p>The conspirators found means to increase the number
</p>
<p>of their adherents and to occupy the city. Captain
</p>
<p>Ruschino arrived before the gates, according to a pre-
</p>
<p>vious understanding, at the head of a considerable body
</p>
<p>of infantry and shortly after the castellan of Cremona
</p>
<p>arrived with reinforcements. These were followed by
</p>
<p>Gonzaga himself who took possession in the name of
</p>
<p>Csesar. The vengeance of Doria was complete.
</p>
<p>The Venitians were greatly grieved by these events ;
</p>
<p>indeed, all the governments in Italy which were
</p>
<p>unfriendly to the Spanish power were alarmed at its

<p>PIER LUIGI FARNESE, 239
</p>
<p>Piacenza was never restored to the Farnese in spite
</p>
<p>of that spirited discourse which Casa wrote to Caesar
</p>
<p>and which we find in his works. The Pope in full
</p>
<p>concistory asked an account from the emperor of the
</p>
<p>assassination of his son and the seizure of Piacenza, and
</p>
<p>demanded the punishment of Gonzaga. But the
</p>
<p>emperor pleased with his success, paid no attention
</p>
<p>either to the threats of the Pope or the appeals of his
</p>
<p>son-in-law and Margaret. Gonzaga was not even
</p>
<p>content with Piacenza but attempted to grasp Parma
</p>
<p>also. He moved an army against it, but the valour of
</p>
<p>Camillo Orsino rendered his efforts fruitless. To
</p>
<p>secure his grandson against Spanish treachery, Paul
</p>
<p>kept him near his own person in Rome, until Ottavio,
</p>
<p>weary of living in privacy put himself into the power
</p>
<p>of the ministers of Charles and returned to Parma.
</p>
<p>The old pontiff, pricked to the heart by the death of
</p>
<p>his son and the fruitlessness of his appeals to other
</p>
<p>governments against Spain, soon ended his days in
</p>
<p>bitterness and sorrow (1549).
</p>
<p>Though the assassins of Farnese obtained rewards
</p>
<p>from the emperor they were long the objects of
</p>
<p>atrocious persecutions from Eome. Anguissola was
</p>
<p>created governor of Como ; but he sought refuge from
</p>
<p>many assassins who dodged his steps in the Pliniana
</p>
<p>villa which he had constructed. Beleseur, French
</p>
<p>ambassador, having encountered him in the Grisons
</p>
<p>tried to pierce him in the very palace of the bishop

<p>with the dagger of papal vengance. A certain Rinaldo

<p>him in the mantle of a friar ; and when this assassin
</p>
<p>was punished, many others rose up to take his place,
</p>
<p>until Anguissola seeing himself the object of universal
</p>
<p>scorn and the mark of every stiletto terminated his
</p>
<p>miserable life in sorrow and remorse. Gerolamo
</p>
<p>Pallavicini who with his brother Alessando and others
</p>
<p>was an accomplice in that crime was making the cam-
</p>
<p>paign in Flanders in 1552, in company with his
</p>
<p>relatives. Eight masked men one day assailed him,
</p>
<p>killed all his relatives and left him stretched upon the
</p>
<p>earth with five severe wounds. However, he recovered
</p>
<p>and retired to his castle of Castiglione di Lodi, which
</p>
<p>he had obtained from the Fieschi. He made a vow
</p>
<p>to marry the first woman whom he should meet.
</p>
<p>Fate was propitious and Gerolamina Virotelli, the
</p>
<p>daughter of a mountaineer and a woman of more
</p>
<p>than womanly prudence, made the evening of his life
</p>
<p>cheerful. Count Landi died in remorse and bequeathed
</p>
<p>a rich legacy to the heir of the murdered Farnese.
</p>
<p>Gonzaga, too, died miserably. Some assassins, Corsican
</p>
<p>soldiers of Ottavio Farnese, several times attempted to
</p>
<p>kill him ; but it was reserved for the Genoese to avenge
</p>
<p>on him the death of the Fieschi and Farnese, and his
</p>
<p>other crimes. Tommaso Marini and Ottobuono Giusti-
</p>
<p>niani obtained a decree from Charles, that Gonzaga be
</p>
<p>subjected to an examination for the robberies with
</p>
<p>which he was charged. The emperor acquitted him,
</p>
<p>but removed him from the governorship of Milan
</p>
<p>and the disgrace so wounded him that he died of

<p>his grief.
</p>
<p>PIER LUIGI FARNESE. 241
</p>
<p>These acts of vengeance were followed by others of
</p>
<p>a fierce character. In these, Andrea Doria was the
</p>
<p>instructor. At the death of Pier Luigi nothing re-
</p>
<p>mained for him but to punish the Pope for his com-
</p>
<p>plicity with the Count of Lavagna ; but the elevation
</p>
<p>of Paul and the sanctity of his office put him out of
</p>
<p>the reach of personal violence. Other arms than
</p>
<p>daggers must be employed, and fortune put them into
</p>
<p>the hands of Doria. We must here premise that after
</p>
<p>the death of Gianluigi, the Pope, to suppress the
</p>
<p>rumour that he was accessory to the conspiracy, sent
</p>
<p>Andrea a brief, condoling with him for the death of
</p>
<p>Gianettino. The fierce Genoese, who well knew the
</p>
<p>arts of Roman wolves, swallowed his resentiment and
</p>
<p>was silent until the time arrived to settle his account
</p>
<p>with the successor of St. Peter. As soon as he learned
</p>
<p>through Cristoforo Lercaro Di Salvo, captain of
</p>
<p>Chiavari, that Pier Luigi was dead, he took that same
</p>
<p>brief, changed only the names and sent it back to the
</p>
<p>author as his letter of condolence for the death of the
</p>
<p>pontifi'^s son. The injury was great ; but the punish-
</p>
<p>ment was terrible.
</p>
<p>These punishments and assassinations did not restore
</p>
<p>order and confidence. The blood which had been
</p>
<p>spilled fertilized the soil for a new harvest of disaster
</p>
<p>and suff"erinDf.

<p>Charles V. had long ciierislied the design of rendering

<p>the entire Peninsula subject to his authority. He was

<p>master of the Sicilies and the Milanese and controlled
</p>
<p>Tuscany through the servility of Cosimo ; and if he

<p>were able to complete the conquest of Genoa, it would

<p>be easy to expel the French army from Piedmont

<p>where Henry II. was preparing to renew the war in

<p>Italy. It is true that the emperor through the senate

<p>dependence on the will and favour of individuals did

<p>not seem to Charles either a dignified or durable means

<p>THE NOBLES AND THE PLEBEIANS. 243
</p>
<p>FigueiToa, knowing the wishes of his master, opened
</p>
<p>his views to the old nobles who were his intimates and
</p>
<p>drew them over to his wishes. He terrified them by
</p>
<p>setting forth the prospect of new conspiracies and the
</p>
<p>popular affection for Gianluigi which was still strong
</p>
<p>in the city. He told them that Andrea was too
</p>
<p>decrepit to combat these approaching perils and that
</p>
<p>prudence counselled adequate provisions to suppress
</p>
<p>revolt. Figuerroa found in the minds of the old
</p>
<p>nobles, morbidly sensitive to the least breath of popular
</p>
<p>commotion, complacent acquiescence, and he induced
</p>
<p>some of the faction of San Luca to address a petition
</p>
<p>to the emperor in Germany, in which they exaggerated
</p>
<p>the Fieschi movement, showed the uncertain faith of
</p>
<p>many of the Italian princes and the danger of general
</p>
<p>revolt and concluded by requesting that the security
</p>
<p>of Genoa be provided for by a Spanish garrison and a
</p>
<p>more stable form of government.
</p>
<p>The emperor answered the appeal by sending Nicol6
</p>
<p>Perenoto, lord of Granveille and imperial councillor,
</p>
<p>with some engineers, to construct a fortress on the hill
</p>
<p>of Pietra Minuta as a rein on the Genoese populace.
</p>
<p>This fortification garrisoned by a strong Spanish force
</p>
<p>would have secured the imperial power and stifled all
</p>
<p>attempts at revolution. But Andrea, who wished to
</p>
<p>rule Genoa himself, vehemently opposed the erection
</p>
<p>of a fortress to be occupied by imperial troops. The
</p>
<p>prince desired to be the sole imperial representative in
</p>
<p>Genoa and to keep the Spanish crown in a state of

</p>
<p>dependence upon his loyalty. He therefore resisted
</p>
<p>244 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGI FIESCHI.
</p>
<p>the innovation with all his power, and boldly told
</p>
<p>Granveille that he must lay aside the project. When
</p>
<p>the imperial minister informed him of the petition sent
</p>
<p>by the Genoese nobility to the emperor, the old man
</p>
<p>called to him the persons chiefly concerned in that
</p>
<p>business, reproached them spiritedly for the weakness
</p>
<p>they had shown in falling into an imperial trap, and
</p>
<p>induced them to recant their approval of this scheme
</p>
<p>of national humiliation.
</p>
<p>But Granveille still hoped to win Doria's consent to
</p>
<p>the wishes of the emperor, and he frequently sent his
</p>
<p>engineers to Pietra Minuta for the purpose of defining
</p>
<p>the position of the new citadel. The people saw these
</p>
<p>surveys, and they one day broke into tumult, rushed
</p>
<p>to the place and would have killed Granveille and his
</p>
<p>engineers if the senate had not forseen the danger and
</p>
<p>stationed troops so as to prevent access to the hill.
</p>
<p>The emperor was now convinced that he could only
</p>
<p>carry out his plans by an open war both with Andi'ea
</p>
<p>and the people ; and he therefore Avrote to the prince
</p>
<p>that he would renounce a project which seemed so
</p>
<p>distasteful to his admiral.
</p>
<p>Doria on his side pledged himself to reform the
</p>
<p>government and give it such a dkection as to put it
</p>
<p>out of the power of a few persons to reestablish the
</p>
<p>popular constitution. He accordingly instituted the
</p>
<p>provision called Garibetto which entirely excluded
</p>
<p>popular families from political power and gave rise to
</p>
<p>many civil disorders and finally to intestine war. It

</p>
<p>completed the alienation of the masses from the
</p>
<p>THE NOBLES AND THE PLEBEIANS. 245
</p>
<p>nobility and destroyed the vital force of the Republic.
</p>
<p>But the plebeians, the more they were depressed, burned
</p>
<p>the more for liberty. The spirit of revolution some-
</p>
<p>times slumbered but was never entirely extinguished.
</p>
<p>The opposition of Doria and the threatening attitude
</p>
<p>of the populace deterred the Spaniards and the greater
</p>
<p>part of the old nobles from carrpng out their scheme
</p>
<p>of building a fortress to overawe the people. But
</p>
<p>though Charles bent to the will of our people in that
</p>
<p>project, he secured through the prince a more oligarchic
</p>
<p>form of government and removed the new nobles from
</p>
<p>power. This success and the increasing subservience
</p>
<p>of Doria inspired Charles with new hope that he might
</p>
<p>get Genoa entirely in his power as a first step to the
</p>
<p>complete control of the Peninsula. He renewed his
</p>
<p>efforts mth more shrewdness and contrived a scheme
</p>
<p>for taking the populace by surprise and lulling to sleep
</p>
<p>the vigilance of the old admiral.
</p>
<p>A conference was held in Piacenza by the Duke of
</p>
<p>Alba, Gonzaga, an envoy of Cosimo, and Tomaso
</p>
<p>de' Marini a Genoese knio;ht. It was agreed that when
</p>
<p>Doria had sailed to Spain, to escort the Archduke
</p>
<p>Maximilian, Gonzaga should enter the city with a
</p>
<p>large body of imperial troops and Cosimo should
</p>
<p>support the movement with some regiments of infantry.
</p>
<p>The pretext for this military concentration was afibrded
</p>
<p>by the fact that the Prince Don Phillip, called into
</p>
<p>Germany by his father, would return with Doria to
</p>
<p>Genoa and Cosimo and Gouzao-a would q-o thither to

<p>pay him homage.
</p>
<p>246 CONSPIKACY OF GIANLUIGI FIESCHI.
</p>
<p>Having made these arrangements, the Duke of Alba
</p>
<p>sailed with Doria for Spain (July, 1548) in order to
</p>
<p>prepare other parts of the conspiracy. But the Genoese
</p>
<p>fortunately received information of the plot. The
</p>
<p>Pope, who, since the death of his son, distrusted the
</p>
<p>emperor more than ever, having heard of the conference
</p>
<p>in Piacenza, instructed Carlo Orsino, governor of
</p>
<p>Piacenza, to ascertain what had been done by the con-
</p>
<p>spirators. Orsino laboured so well that he penetrated
</p>
<p>the mystery. Some incautious words of Gonzaga put
</p>
<p>him on the scent of the movement and enabled him to
</p>
<p>inform the Pope of the nature of the emperor's plans.
</p>
<p>Paul communicated this intelligence to Leonardo
</p>
<p>Strata, a Genoese noble living in Eome, and Strata
</p>
<p>immediately wi'ote to the senate. The scheme was so
</p>
<p>bold and unexpected that the senators were at first
</p>
<p>disposed to distrust the report. But their doubts were
</p>
<p>soon removed. Gonzaga soon after sent a messenger
</p>
<p>to notify the government that Don Phillip would soon
</p>
<p>arrive in Genoa, and to ask quarters in the city for
</p>
<p>two thousand cavalry and as many arquebusiers. At
</p>
<p>the same time, Cosimo wrote asking permission to pay
</p>
<p>homage to the prince in Genoa and to bring as an
</p>
<p>escort, to protect him against the plots of Genoese
</p>
<p>exiles, two regiments of cavalry and two of infantry.
</p>
<p>Andrea also wrote from Rosas (October 19th, 1548) a
</p>
<p>letter to the Doge, which, as an eloquent proof of his
</p>
<p>servility to Spain, we give entire :

</p>
<p>the prince desires to have forwarded in advance of
</p>
<p>himself, for reasons which you will more fully learn
</p>
<p>from his ambassador, Figuerroa. Their mission as you
</p>
<p>will learn is to prepare lodgings for this court. It
</p>
<p>seems expedient for me to wiite you these few words,
</p>
<p>as a citizen, praying you to give me pleasure by
</p>
<p>issuing orders that these quarter-masters be allowed to

<p>Eeceive them with such marks of esteem as you are

<p>accustomed to give when the honour of princes and
</p>
<p>the glory of the city are concerned, in order that His
</p>
<p>Majesty and this Illustrious Prince, his son, may know
</p>
<p>that, not only in this, but in matters of much greater
</p>
<p>moment, you are delighted to render him service. For,
</p>
<p>besides the general rejDute which your excellencies will

<p>gain by such a course of conduct, the favour of His
</p>
<p>Majesty and His Highness will be much greater

<p>towards you, and their love for the Eepublic will be

<p>increased so that they will the more cheerfully aid her

<p>should remember that we have no other light or

<p>support but the great goodness of His Majesty which
</p>
<p>permits us to live within his kingdoms without any
</p>
<p>sense of subjection, and that for this reason alone the
</p>
<p>whole city ought to do spontaneously whatever is

<p>required in these circumstances, and all the more that

</p>
<p>our citizens will interpose oljstacles as they are

<p>accustomed to do in such emergencies ; but your

</p>
<p>of the matter, will strive to remove all difficulties,
</p>
<p>compel all to preserve order and obedience and punish
</p>
<p>whoever makes oj)position in such a way as to render
</p>
<p>them a warning and example to all the rest. I have
</p>
<p>nothing more to add on this subject ; for I am sure
</p>
<p>that you, as wise men, will carefully reflect on the
</p>
<p>duty we owe the emperor, and voluntarily and cheer-
</p>
<p>fully give those orders that are required ; the more
</p>
<p>that the stay of the prince will be only for a few days,
</p>
<p>and small as the favour will be, His Majesty will
</p>
<p>reckon it a great one and always remember your good
</p>
<p>will and that of the city towards Himself. His
</p>
<p>Highness will also be gratified for your prompt good
</p>
<p>service and all his suite will leave you greatly pleased
</p>
<p>by your hospitality. M. Domenico Doria, the bearer
</p>
<p>of this letter, will speak more fully of this concernment

<p>to your Excellencies, to whom I commend me with

<p>affectionate solicitude."

<p>These simultaneous requests removed the doubts of
</p>
<p>the senators. They showed an admirable firmness in
</p>
<p>refusing quarters for the soldiers of Gonzaga and
</p>
<p>Medici. Gonzaga renewed his request and the senate

<p>replied that if he appeared at the gates with more
</p>
<p>than twenty horses he would find them shut in his

<p>face. He came with three hundred infantry and two

</p>
<p>the firmness of the senate, relinquished the design of
</p>
<p>coming. But no one dared resist Doria, and his
</p>
<p>Spaniards were received in the city.
</p>
<p>While these events were transpiring Don Phillip
</p>
<p>sailed out of Spain with a fleet of fifty-eight galleys,
</p>
<p>of which nineteen belonged to Prince Doria and six to
</p>
<p>Antonio Doria, two to the prince of Monaco and two
</p>
<p>to Visconte Cicala. There were forty other vessels of
</p>
<p>which six were Genoese. Don Phillip took passage on
</p>
<p>board the admiral's galley, a vessel wonderful for her
</p>
<p>size, construction and equipment. The designs of the
</p>
<p>embellishments were made by Pierino del Vaga, and
</p>
<p>executed by Carota and Tasso, Florentine artists. The
</p>
<p>standards were painted by Vaga. The gilding, the
</p>
<p>satins and the rich brocades rendered the vessel a
</p>
<p>marvel of beauty. The young prince, astonished by
</p>
<p>this magnificence, was prodigal of honours and marks
</p>
<p>of affection to Andrea, hoping to captivate the old man
</p>
<p>and secure his cooperation in the plot against the
</p>
<p>Eepublic. As they neared our coasts, Phillip inquired
</p>
<p>of the admiral where he would be quartered in Genoa.
</p>
<p>The admiral responded that he hoped to have that
</p>
<p>honour for his palace in Fassiolo, where the emperor
</p>
<p>had been his guest. The young Prince showed
</p>
<p>dissatisfaction at the response and rejoined that he
</p>
<p>wished to reside in the Ducal palace. " That," replied
</p>
<p>Andrea " Is not in my power. Your Highness may ask
</p>
<p>it of the senate, though I am of opinion that those who
</p>
<p>live there will not willingly evacuate it." These frank

<p>reported that their plan could not be put into execution.
</p>
<p>The young prince broke out into angry imprecations ;
</p>
<p>but his preceptor, the Duke of Alba conjured him to
</p>
<p>conceal his displeasure lest the suspicions of the
</p>
<p>Genoese should be increased, and Phillip constrained
</p>
<p>himself to a complacent reception of the messengers of
</p>
<p>the Republic.
</p>
<p>He landed at Savona and was entertained by
</p>
<p>Benedetta Spinola, a beautiful and courteous widow.
</p>
<p>After a brief stay he proceeded to Genoa. The princess
</p>
<p>Peretta received him in the Doria palace with the
</p>
<p>highest honour. The Doge and the senators, the
</p>
<p>Genoese cardinals Doria and Cybo, Lord Bishop Matera,
</p>
<p>envoy of the Pope, and the ministers of other nations
</p>
<p>went to pay him homage.
</p>
<p>We shall not dwell on the sumptuous reception of
</p>
<p>Phillip by the nobility, or the splendour which Doria
</p>
<p>displayed with his open court and princely banquets
</p>
<p>for the Spanish barons. The luxury of the decorations,
</p>
<p>the richness of the furniture, the splendour of the
</p>
<p>carpets and service of every kind and the wealth sunk
</p>
<p>in the banquets of that palace were then the marvel of
</p>
<p>Italy. Don Phillip and his suite were filled with
</p>
<p>admiration by the magnificence of their reception.
</p>
<p>The Genoese populace did not participate in these
</p>
<p>festivities. They could ill brook these servile attentions
</p>
<p>towards those who were conspiring, not merely to
</p>
<p>deprive them of political power, but to take away the

</p>
<p>ill-concealed rage, they were more than once on the
</p>
<p>brink of revolution. On the 3rd of December at
</p>
<p>midnight, the people rose at the cry of " Ammazza,
</p>
<p>Amniazza"  kill them, kill them  and rushed to attack
</p>
<p>fifty of the Bisogni who were in a tavern of the mole ;
</p>
<p>and they would have despatched the Spaniards, if
</p>
<p>Colonel Spinola had not arrived on the ground with a
</p>
<p>strong body of infantry in time to quell the tumult.
</p>
<p>But the rage of the populace continued. Don Phillip
</p>
<p>had requested the city police to arrest a certain Don
</p>
<p>Antonio d' Arze, a Spaniard guilty of homicide. After
</p>
<p>the arrest, he sent eighty Spanish arquebusiers to
</p>
<p>conduct the criminal from the prison on board a galley.
</p>
<p>Near the Ducal palace, this body of Spaniards met the
</p>
<p>city guard. The Bisogni had their matches lit, and
</p>
<p>and the guard, believing that the imperial troops came
</p>
<p>to assault the palace, prepared to make a desperate
</p>
<p>resistance, and in fact drove the Spaniards back by
</p>
<p>force. Many of the latter were wounded and some lost
</p>
<p>their lives. In a twinkling, the rumour ran that the
</p>
<p>Spaniards had attacked the Ducal palace ; the people
</p>
<p>collected in crowds and would have put the Spaniards
</p>
<p>to the edge of the sword if the Doge and two governors
</p>
<p>of the palace had not mingled in the crowd and soothed
</p>
<p>the irritation. Prince Doria himself was carried in a
</p>
<p>palanquin through the most populous quarters, and
</p>
<p>besought the people to lay aside their hostile intentions.
</p>
<p>The populace was held in subjection by force and
</p>
<p>supplications ; but the Spaniards lost no time in re-
</p>
<p>turning on board their ships, and Don Phillip departed

<p>dissimulating his animosity against the city.
</p>
<p>252 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGT FTESCHI.
</p>
<p>We must here speak of an incident wliicli occurred
</p>
<p>while Don Phillip was the guest of the city ; though
</p>
<p>Bandello places it some years earlier.
</p>
<p>In one of the many descents of the Turkish corsair
</p>
<p>upon the Eiviera, they had captured a Genoese girl
</p>
<p>about ten years of age, belonging, says the chronicle,
</p>
<p>to the illustrious family of the Calvi. Being of re-
</p>
<p>markable beauty she was sold by the pirates at a high
</p>
<p>price to a merchant who carried her into Spain. Here
</p>
<p>she grew more beautiful with years and inspired a son
</p>
<p>of the Duke of Alba with an ardent passion which he
</p>
<p>found means to satisfy. When Don Phillip came into
</p>
<p>Italy, the young man was obliged to accompany the
</p>
<p>cortege ; but not wishing to leave the young woman,
</p>
<p>he took her on board one of the vessels and brought
</p>
<p>her to Genoa. Annina had never forgotten her parents
</p>
<p>and her native city ; and as soon as she landed, she
</p>
<p>induced her pages by rich presents to find her lodgings
</p>
<p>on the piazza Maruffi, near the palace of Stefano
</p>
<p>Fieschi and in the residence of the Calvi. Annina
</p>
<p>entered her father's house with joy, and, seizing a
</p>
<p>moment when her lover was occupied with Don Phillip,
</p>
<p>she dismissed her domestics and revealed herself to
</p>
<p>her parents. The embracings, the tears, the transports
</p>
<p>of tenderness, cannot be described. But the noble girl
</p>
<p>broke off these demonstrations of affection. "It is
</p>
<p>time that I think of my liberation. Though loaded
</p>
<p>with ornaments, I have been hitherto only a slave, and
</p>
<p>I owe it to my dignity and my blood to atone in the
</p>
<p>shadow of the altar for my dishonourable though forced

</p>
<p>THE NOBLES AND THE PLEBEIANS. 253
</p>
<p>master learns that I belong to you, and put me in a
</p>
<p>cell where none may ever hear my name pronounced."
</p>
<p>Her parents approved her choice and at once sent her
</p>
<p>to a monastery near the city, where she was received
</p>
<p>under another name. She had scarcely departed when
</p>
<p>the knight came to find his mistress, and, inquiring for
</p>
<p>her, he read in the silence of the pages that she had
</p>
<p>fled. He was at the first moment about to wreak his
</p>
<p>anger on these servants ; but he restrained himself and
</p>
<p>demanded of the Calvi the restoration of the girl. An
</p>
<p>angry contention arose which raised a tumult in that
</p>
<p>part of the city. In a few moments the piazza was
</p>
<p>full of men of both nations. Among the first to enter
</p>
<p>the house of Calvi to succour the Genoese was Giovanni
</p>
<p>Lavagna, allied by blood to the Fieschi. He was one
</p>
<p>of the most reckless warriors of his time. Encountering
</p>
<p>the Spanish knight at the head of the staircase sur-
</p>
<p>rounded by armed men and threatening the bystanders,
</p>
<p>he demanded the cause of his discourteous manners.
</p>
<p>Alba replied :  i
</p>
<p>" It does not concern thee, white moor and traitor
</p>
<p>that thou art ! "
</p>
<p>Lavagna was not accustomed to receive abuse with
</p>
<p>patience, and he angrily retorted : 
</p>
<p>" Moorish Jew, thou liest in the throat I" and drawing
</p>
<p>his sword, threw himself upon the Spaniard. The
</p>
<p>fight was of brief duration. Despite the assistance of
</p>
<p>his companions, the knight was pierced to the heart.
</p>
<p>The Spaniards descended into the piazza and came to

</p>
<p>others to flight. Lavagna fearing the vengeance of
</p>
<p>Phillip took refuge in the province of Piacenza.
</p>
<p>Don Phillip did not relinquish the hope of reducing
</p>
<p>Genoa to the condition of a province, and he was
</p>
<p>encouraged by Gonzaga, Figuerroa and the Duke of
</p>
<p>Alba. The plan of the new fortress was again taken
</p>
<p>up. The partisans of Spain reasoned that the popular
</p>
<p>hostility to Spain constantly threatened the city with
</p>
<p>revolution and that so stubborn a people needed a
</p>
<p>strong rein. It was reasonable enough they said that
</p>
<p>Doria, when he was in the full vigour of life, should
</p>
<p>have opposed the erection of the citadel, but now when
</p>
<p>he was old and infirm almost to decrepitude he ought
</p>
<p>no longer to resist the will of Csesar.
</p>
<p>Charles sent to Genoa a certain Sigismondi Fransino
</p>
<p>with instructions to confer with Doria and Centurione
</p>
<p>and endeavour to gain their consent to the fortification.
</p>
<p>Some engineers also came secretly, for the purpose of
</p>
<p>selecting the most convenient site. They renounced
</p>
<p>the plan of fortifying Pietra Minuta and recommended
</p>
<p>that the fortress of Castelletto should be restored.
</p>
<p>Doria hearing of this new plan and wishing to finish
</p>
<p>once for all with these projects for the humiliation
</p>
<p>of Genoa, sent Adamo Centurione into Flanders to
</p>
<p>confer with Csesar and convince him that there was
</p>
<p>imminent peril of losing the Kepublic altogether
</p>
<p>unless these schemes were renounced. Charles made
</p>
<p>the most formal pledges that he would put a stop to
</p>
<p>the intrigue and never again raise the question. The

<p>advice of Don Bernardino Mendozza probably had
</p>
<p>THE noblb:s akd the plebieans. 255
</p>
<p>more weight with Charles than the remonstrances of
</p>
<p>Centurione. Menclozza was a man of infinite cunninor
</p>
<p>o
</p>
<p>and dexterity in politics. He pointed out to his
</p>
<p>sovereign the excessive devotion of the Genoese to the
</p>
<p>acquisition of wealth, and advised him to employ every
</p>
<p>artifice to get their money into the imperial treasury
</p>
<p>in the form of loans secured upon lands, privileges,
</p>
<p>feuds and jurisdictions in Sicily, Naples and Spain.
</p>
<p>" Thus/' said the adroit poKtician, " you will bind the
</p>
<p>Genoese to the fortunes of your kingdom by a volun-
</p>
<p>tary chain ; since when their riches are in your hands
</p>
<p>they will be naturally inclined to increase and maintain
</p>
<p>your power. This hold upon their affections will be
</p>
<p>worth more than any fortress."
</p>
<p>This shrewd advice was followed ; every induce-
</p>
<p>ment was held out to the wealthy nobles to place their
</p>
<p>money in the hands of the emperor, with such securities
</p>
<p>and guarrantees as would infallibly induce other
</p>
<p>citizens to follow the example and bind themselves
</p>
<p>Avith their fortunes to Spain. By this expedient
</p>
<p>Charles seemed to leave the Genoese their independence,
</p>
<p>but he really made them tributary to his crown,
</p>
<p>Phillip II. pursued this policy with even greater as-
</p>
<p>siduity and it became hereditary in the Spanish princes.
</p>
<p>It was in fact for two centuries the political science by
</p>
<p>which the court of Spain regulated the affairs of Italy ;
</p>
<p>and the people found themselves insensibly bound,
</p>
<p>without their own action, to the interests and policy of
</p>
<p>that crown. It must be said that some give a different

</p>
<p>tell Uf? that, even in this, Doria was subservient to
</p>
<p>Charles ; but we cannot believe it possible. His stead-
</p>
<p>fast resistance to that scheme is more consistent with
</p>
<p>the greatness and fame of the illustrious admiral ; and,
</p>
<p>though he was a vehement partisan of the imperial
</p>
<p>cause, he could not have wished to become, like Cosimo,
</p>
<p>its slave. When the Medici gave up to imperial troops
</p>
<p>the fortresses of Florence and Leghorn, he found him-
</p>
<p>self in the hands of a master, and never digested, the
</p>
<p>returt of Venice, who refused to treat with him
</p>
<p>dcause he was, in his own house, the servant of
</p>
<p>another man."
</p>
<p>We think the truth to be that when Doiia saw the
</p>
<p>unanimity of the people in opposing the erection of a
</p>
<p>citadel, he wisely resolved to support his fellow-citizens,
</p>
<p>and the people are entitled to the chief praise for the
</p>
<p>failure of that scheme. They were not yet corrupted
</p>
<p>by the servility of the nobility, and might have
</p>
<p>renewed the examples of their ancient valour and
</p>
<p>prevented the foreign power from striking root in the
</p>
<p>Republic. They lost no opportunity of manifesting
</p>
<p>their profound dislike of Spain, as Doge Lercaro
</p>
<p>himself testifies. When Charles gave to Cosimo the
</p>
<p>government of Piombino, then in the hands of the
</p>
<p>Appiani, the Genoese rose up in arms and demanded of
</p>
<p>the senate that galleys be despatched to Elba to expel
</p>
<p>the Florentines and Spaniards. This time, too, it was
</p>
<p>Doria who held back the arms of the people.
</p>
<p>It is easy to see that the new ties between Genoa

</p>
<p>Doria, by breaking the French alliance and persecuting
</p>
<p>the men of Barbary (instead of courting their alliance
</p>
<p>after the example of Venice) hastened our fall. Our
</p>
<p>commerce gradually declined. French and Barbary
</p>
<p>fleets roved over our seas and destroyed our marine.
</p>
<p>The city was put to great straits, and longed in vain
</p>
<p>for the only remedy for its maladies, the alliance of
</p>
<p>France to open up the commerce of the East. Fieschi,
</p>
<p>who had courted these benefits, was remembered the
</p>
<p>more sadly as disasters multiplied upon the Eepublic.
</p>
<p>The government comprehended that some important
</p>
<p>and energetic measures must be taken to restore our
</p>
<p>fortunes ; and, after mature reflection, the senate re-
</p>
<p>solved to attempt the recovery of our Eastern trade.
</p>
<p>The only remnant of our extensive possessions in the
</p>
<p>Levant was the island of Scio, which was still held by
</p>
<p>the family of the Giustiniani. In 1558, Giovanni
</p>
<p>Di Franchi and Nicol6 Grillo were sent to Constan-
</p>
<p>tinople, with eight vessels bearing costly presents for
</p>
<p>the Sultan and his principal ministers, to ask a renewal
</p>
<p>of trade and treaties of amity and commerce such as
</p>
<p>the Porte maintained with the Venitians.
</p>
<p>The Porte was disposed to accept our trade and
</p>
<p>friendship, but the king of France raised ol^jections
</p>
<p>which destroyed the hopes of Genoa. He showed the
</p>
<p>Porte that the Genoese were the fast allies of Spain,
</p>
<p>and could not remain neutral between Spaniards and
</p>
<p>Turks ; that all the maritime enterprises of Charles to

<p>the damage of the Turks had been conducted with

</p>
<p>and ruled it at liis caprice ; that, in fine, the Porte
</p>
<p>could not safely listen to the proposals of the Genoese
</p>
<p>unless they declared themselves enemies of Spain.
</p>
<p>These arguments changed the purpose of Soliman, and
</p>
<p>he sent the Ligurian ambassadors home without giving
</p>
<p>them audience. The RejDublic lost hope of reacquiring
</p>
<p>that commerce with the East which had once enabled
</p>
<p>it to triumj)h over Pisa and Venice.
</p>
<p>Such were the consequences of our fatal bondage to
</p>
<p>the empire. The people, guided by infallible instincts,
</p>
<p>showed in this matter more wisdom than their rulers.
</p>
<p>If we had shaken off the imperial embraces, we might

<p>have obtained from the Turks all those privileges which

<p>the Venitians had acquired a few years before ; nor

<p>were fretting, and the Venitians soon after, becoming

</p>
<p>and rose almost to a man, protesting againts inqui-
</p>
<p>sitors and martp'doms. Their protests yielded no
</p>
<p>fruit and they seized their arms, deposed the foreign
</p>
<p>governors and created new magistrates, promising,
</p>
<p>however, to maintain their devotion to the empire.
</p>
<p>Toledo issued a proclamation that he would proceed to
</p>
<p>the trial and pimishment of Tommaso Aniello of
</p>
<p>Sorrento and Cesare Mormile, who were reputed the
</p>
<p>leaders of the sedition. The two rebels came before
</p>
<p>the judges with such a mass of followers, that the court
</p>
<p>counted it better policy to honour rather than punish
</p>
<p>them. But the viceroy, determined to terrify Naples,
</p>
<p>barbarously butchered Gianluigi Capuano, Fabrizio
</p>
<p>d' Alessandro and Antonio Villamarino, and threatened
</p>
<p>capital punishment against any who should remove the
</p>
<p>bloody corpses.
</p>
<p>This exasperated but did not awe the populace.

<p>They made common cause with the barons, sent depu-

<p>ties to the emperor and signed a truce with Toledo

<p>was worse than war. The Bisogni, who had taken

<p>refuge in the castles, not only destroyed the surrounding
</p>
<p>houses, but in theii' frequent sorties killed all who fell
</p>
<p>into their hands, and the populace retorted by killing
</p>
<p>the Spanish prisoners whom they had captured.

<p>Centurione, enlisted new crews and officers, and soon
</p>
<p>had a fleet ready to sail. The galleys were sent off
</p>
<p>under his lieutenants Marco Centurione, son of Adamo,
</p>
<p>and Antonio Doria. Thanks to these ships of Doria,
</p>
<p>Toledo suppressed the revolt in Naples, took capital
</p>
<p>vengeance on the leaders and punished the people with
</p>
<p>heavy taxation. Yet it has been said that the emperor
</p>
<p>pardoned the rebels ! History spoke falsehood. Still,
</p>
<p>this stormy protest of the people saved Naples from
</p>
<p>the inquisition. The masses well knew the real object
</p>
<p>of Toledo. He sought less to crush heresy than to
</p>
<p>exterminate the spirit of liberty.
</p>
<p>The Neapolitans were a few years later silent
</p>
<p>witnesses of fierce religious persecution. The inqui-
</p>
<p>sition employed such zeal, that to mention Montalto
</p>
<p>alone, two thousand persons were butchered and nearly
</p>
<p>an equal number condemned to death in eleven days.

<p>Tradition says that the executioner cut them down in

<p>the streets, like so many goats. While, through the

<p>assistance of Doria, the Spanish power took firm root

</p>
<p>a few daring spirits still struggled to emancipate the
</p>
<p>nation and to destroy tlie prop on wliicli the emperor
</p>
<p>leaned. The times were sanguinary ; blood was
</p>
<p>washed out with blood. The partisans of Fieschi
</p>
<p>raging for vengeance often attempted to assassinate
</p>
<p>Andrea ; and the obstacles in their way only increased
</p>
<p>their fury. In August, 1547, four men of Valditaro,
</p>
<p>to whom Galeotto of Mirandola added eight of his
</p>
<p>bandits, were sent to Genoa for the purpose of assas-
</p>
<p>sinating Doria while he should be coming out of his
</p>
<p>palace. It was intended that a conspiracy organized
</p>
<p>in the city should seize the moment for proclaiming a
</p>
<p>popular government and maintaining it by force of
</p>
<p>arms. Galeotto promised to lead the enterprise in
</p>
<p>person. He was a terrible man, and his partisans
</p>
<p>believed that no enterprise could miscarry which had
</p>
<p>at its head so practiced a conspirator and assassin.
</p>
<p>The histories relate of him that when the Count Gian-
</p>
<p>francesco, a literary man of note, had been restored to
</p>
<p>the government of Mirandola by the officers of Julius
</p>
<p>IL, Galeotto, in a night of October, 1533, scaled the
</p>
<p>fortress with forty companions, killed the count who
</p>
<p>was kneeling before the crucifix, his uncle and his son
</p>
<p>Alberto, and then shutting up the dependents of the
</p>
<p>count in the prison of the fortress took possession of
</p>
<p>the government of Mirandola. Charles V. condemned
</p>
<p>him to death for this horrid crime ; but Galeotto
</p>
<p>defended himself alike against the arms and the
</p>
<p>treachery of Leyva, and finally surrendered the castle

</p>
<p>With such men, the conspiracy did not seem likely
</p>
<p>to fail of its principal object. HoAvever, the assassins
</p>
<p>could not find in Genoa safe hiding for studying the
</p>
<p>habits of Andrea. Besides, the cunning old man Avas
</p>
<p>on the alert for such plots, and never left his house
</p>
<p>except under a strong escort of his faithful dependents.
</p>
<p>The assassins found it necessary to save their own lives
</p>
<p>by a precipitate flight.
</p>
<p>A second attempt at his assassination came to the
</p>
<p>knowledge of Doria. Cornelio Bentivoglio, aided by
</p>
<p>the exiles, especially the Fiesclii, armed a galley with
</p>
<p>two hundred men and all necessary equipments, with
</p>
<p>the design of entering the port by night and attacking
</p>
<p>the palace of Doria. At the same time the exiles
</p>
<p>assisted by Pier Luigi Farnese were expected to attack
</p>
<p>the city on the East side. On this occasion, also, the
</p>
<p>leader had a reputation which promised success. Benti-
</p>
<p>voglio Avas an audacious and fierce young ma,n, who,
</p>
<p>having been expelled from the government of Bologna
</p>
<p>by his father Costanzo, entered the military service of
</p>
<p>France and obtained considerable repute in the art of
</p>
<p>war. Perhaps the prince would have fallen under this
</p>
<p>conspiracy, if his oavu counterplot against the Duke of
</p>
<p>Piacenza had not broken up the plans of Bentivoglio.
</p>
<p>But the Fieschi party did not lay doAvn their arms
</p>
<p>or relinquish their hopes of vengeance. They enlisted
</p>
<p>Prince Giulio Cybo among others in their cause. This
</p>
<p>nobleman having taken up and continued the con-

</p>
<p>were the same ; the former used more unworthy means
</p>
<p>than the latter, but both ended their lives in misfortune
</p>
<p>consecrated by patriotism.
</p>
<p>The family of the Cybo was of very ancient, perhaps
</p>
<p>of, Byzantine origin. They possessed in the tenth
</p>
<p>century islands and walled towns. In 1188, Ermes
</p>
<p>Cybo subscribed the treaty of peace between the Pisans
</p>
<p>and Ligurians. We find in old manuscripts that, in
</p>
<p>1261, they had palaces in the via del Campo. A
</p>
<p>Guglielmo Cybo, who died in 1311, built the magni-
</p>
<p>ficent church of St. Francis in Casteletto and there was
</p>
<p>erected the marble sepulchre of himself and his family.
</p>
<p>This Guglielmo rendered important services to the
</p>
<p>Republic for which he obtained the privilege of adding
</p>
<p>to his arms the device of the Republic.''' The family
</p>
<p>produced many other distinguished men, among whom
</p>
<p>may be mentioned Innocent VIII. In his youth, this
</p>
<p>pontifi" became the father of a son named Francesco
</p>
<p>who was governor of Rome during the pontificate of
</p>
<p>Innocent and married Maddalena de' Medici sister of
</p>
<p>Leo X. In the year 1500, Lorenzo Cybo was born
</p>
<p>of this marriage in St. Pierdarena, a suberb of Genoa.
</p>
<p>Lorenzo devoted himself to arms, and in the Milan
</p>
<p>war, carried the fortress of Monza by assault. The
</p>
<p>cardinal Innocent Cybo, his elder brother, ceded him
</p>
<p>the county of Ferentillo and he also governed Vetralla,
</p>
<p>Giano and Montegiove. Desirous of enlarging his
</p>
<p>estates, he married Ricciarda daughter and heiress of

</p>
<p>and widow of Count Scipione Fieschi who died in
</p>
<p>1520.
</p>
<p>Ricciarda bore Lorenzo several children, one of whom
</p>
<p>was Eleonora wife of Gianluigi Fieschi. There were
</p>
<p>besides, Isabella, who married Vitaliano Visconti Bor-
</p>
<p>romeo, Giulio and Alberico, Giulio, whose career we
</p>
<p>shall briefly recount, was born in Rome in 1525, and
</p>
<p>was educated in the court of Charles V. where the
</p>
<p>beauty of his person and the sprightliness of his intellect
</p>
<p>acquired him the admiration of the Spanish courtiers.
</p>
<p>The mother of Giulio, who was in possession of Massa
</p>
<p>and Carrara, formed the resolution of transferring the
</p>
<p>feud to the younger brother, Alberico. Giulio went to
</p>
<p>Rome and in vain employed entreaty and threats to
</p>
<p>change her purpose. He then resolved to take by force
</p>
<p>of arms a property which he believed his own. In
</p>
<p>1545, when Ricciarda and Cardinal Cybo were in
</p>
<p>Carrara, he attacked the castle of that place at the
</p>
<p>head of fifty men and endeavoured to capture his
</p>
<p>mother. She fled into the tower and foiled his design.
</p>
<p>She punished with severity some vassals who had aided
</p>
<p>Giulio, and returned to Rome where she ceded the feud
</p>
<p>to Alberico. This increased the exasperation of Giulio
</p>
<p>who renewed his hostile purposes with greater energy.
</p>
<p>Cosimo furnished him some peasant bands of Pietra-
</p>
<p>santa, and Gianettino Doria supported him with his
</p>
<p>fleet. In September, 1546, the disinherited j^ count
</p>
<p>appeared before Massa with one thousand infantry and
</p>
<p>one hundred cavalry. His partisans in the town,

<p>rini, seized the gate of St. Giacomo and opened it to
</p>
<p>Giulio, who was recognized by the people as their
</p>
<p>righful master. The fortress was still held by Pietro
</p>
<p>Gassani ; but Gianettino Doria arrived with his galleys,
</p>
<p>landed artillery and forced him to surrender to Paolo
</p>
<p>di Castello. The fortresses of Moneta and Lavenza
</p>
<p>were also given up to the partisans of Giulio, who,
</p>
<p>grateful for the assistance of Gianettino, espoused his
</p>
<p>sister Peretta. But his reign was of short duration.
</p>
<p>Eicciarda appealed to Charles V., who ordered Gonzaga
</p>
<p>to have the fortress consigned to Cardinal Cybo.
</p>
<p>Giulio refused, Cosimo turned against him, captured
</p>
<p>him at Agnano, and the young count did not obtain
</p>
<p>his liberty until he had ceded the castle (8th March,
</p>
<p>1547) which was occupied by Spanish troops until
</p>
<p>Eicciarda returned to it two years later.
</p>
<p>It is probable that Giulio had at this time some
</p>
<p>intrigues with the French court. The emperor had
</p>
<p>declared against him, and he was desirous of obtaining
</p>
<p>the support of France by ceding the fortress of Massa.
</p>
<p>The partisans of Spain were alarmed at the prospect
</p>
<p>of having a French garrison so near to Genoa, and
</p>
<p>Andrea Doria assisted in forcing Giulio to relinquish
</p>
<p>his hold on his father's domains.
</p>
<p>The young count, full of bitterness for the treatment
</p>
<p>he had received, went to Gonzaga in Piacenza (the
</p>
<p>latter was called to Piacenza by the assassination of
</p>
<p>Pier Luigi Farnese) and remonstrated against being
</p>
<p>deprived of his inheritance. He received no encourage-

</p>
<p>Massa, and went to Parma and conferred with Ottavio
</p>
<p>Farnese who was also soured against the imperial
</p>
<p>agents for old and new acts of hostility. He then
</p>
<p>returned to Kome and negotiated with his mother,
</p>
<p>who agreed to recognize him as Lord of Massa and
</p>
<p>Carrara for forty thousand gold crowns of the sun.
</p>
<p>He borrowed twenty thousand gold crowns upon
</p>
<p>interest, and pledged the twenty thousand crowns of
</p>
<p>the dower of Peretta for the rest. He applied to
</p>
<p>Andrea Doria for the dower of his wife ; but the prince,
</p>
<p>having suspicions of Giulio's complicity with Fieschi,
</p>
<p>refused to pay over the money and neither personal
</p>
<p>entreaty nor the influence of friends could induce the
</p>
<p>prince to satisfy the just demands of Giulio and Peretta.
</p>
<p>He alleged that the damages he had suffered in the
</p>
<p>Fieschi sedition had rendered it impossible for him to
</p>
<p>pay so considerable a sum, and wished to charge Giulio
</p>
<p>with the expenses of Gianettino's expedition of Massa.
</p>
<p>The chronicle of Venturini, which we consult, dis-
</p>
<p>proves the statements of those who A\T:ote history
</p>
<p>without the aid of documents, and renders it clear that
</p>
<p>Andrea debited Cybo with all the expenses incurred
</p>
<p>while the galleys lay on the coast of Massa, of which
</p>
<p>he had preserved a minute account rather as a merchant
</p>
<p>and usurer than as a Prince.
</p>
<p>Cybo was thus deprived of the means of satisfying
</p>
<p>his mother and recovering his paternal inlieritance ;
</p>
<p>and he conspired with the king of France, Duke
</p>
<p>Ottavio and Signer Mortier to deal a great blow against

</p>
<p>consultations with the Cardinal of Belais, the exiles
</p>
<p>Cornelio Fieschi, Paolo Spinola and others. The con-
</p>
<p>federates fixed on the following plan :  The movement
</p>
<p>should be begun in Genoa where the Fieschi had warm
</p>
<p>friends and the Spaniards were detested. Ottobuono
</p>
<p>Fieschi, who though living in Venice had devoted,
</p>
<p>dependents, should furnish five hundred infantry and
</p>
<p>Spinola should introduce into the city and conceal in
</p>
<p>his house one hundred men of the valleys ; Giulio
</p>
<p>would send from Massa upon barks a body of men
</p>
<p>ostensibly to be enrolled at Milan in the imperial
</p>
<p>regiment which he commanded. They believed that
</p>
<p>Doria would have no suspicion on account of the close
</p>
<p>alliance of Cybo with his family, and that all obstacles
</p>
<p>would be easily overcome. Some persons were placed
</p>
<p>by intrigue in the service of Andrea and Centurione,
</p>
<p>with instructions to assassinate them at a preconcerted
</p>
<p>signal. It was believed that the death of those two
</p>
<p>and a few other partisans of Spain would open an easy
</p>
<p>path to the overthrow of the imperial power in Genoa.
</p>
<p>Venice was at that period the asylum of all those
</p>
<p>patriots whom domestic and foreign tyranny had driven
</p>
<p>into exile. In the shadow of the lion of St. Mark,
</p>
<p>Donato Gianotti wrote his weighty prose and that

</p>
<p>Bartolomeo Cavalcanti, a man of great talents and
</p>
<p>eloquence, disgusted with the government of Cosimo,
</p>
<p>had voluntarily joined the exiles. There were also
</p>
<p>many Genoese who had been expelled from home for
</p>
<p>complicity with party broils. Thither went Cybo,
</p>
<p>Gaspare Venturini, Paolo Spinola and captain Aless-
</p>
<p>andro Tomasi of Siena, captain Paolo da Castiglione,
</p>
<p>who was to have been cf the party, pretended to be ill
</p>
<p>at the moment of setting out and remained in Kome
</p>
<p>to betray the conspirators to the ministers of Spain.
</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, Cybo collected his partisans in
</p>
<p>the house of Gaspare Fiesco-Botto. There were present
</p>
<p>besides the exiles already mentioned, the Fieschi
</p>
<p>brothers, Ottaviano Ziuo and Count Galeotto di Miran-
</p>
<p>dola. Cybo spoke warmly of the revolution which he
</p>
<p>was planning. He declared that he wished to free the
</p>
<p>country from the yoke of Spain and restore to its bosom
</p>
<p>the virtuous exiles whom he saw around him, whose
</p>
<p>only crime was an ardent love of country. He desired
</p>
<p>to continue the revolution begun by his unfortunate
</p>
<p>friend and relative the Count Gianluigi, and to avenge
</p>
<p>his untimely fate. Fortune had crushed that rising
</p>
<p>too soon to permit him to reenforce Fieschi with the
</p>
<p>troops he had collected at Borghetto and ordered to
</p>
<p>move on Genoa. He had afterwards pretended to
</p>
<p>support the Doria party only from motives of con-
</p>
<p>venience. But he would now throw aside the mask
</p>
<p>and proclaim them to be traitors who had bound the

<p>Everything promised success to the new rising ; the

<p>270 CONSPIRACY OF GIANUIGI FIESCHI.
</p>
<p>arms were collected, all hearts burning for action and
</p>
<p>the Dorias unprepared to encounter the popular storm.
</p>
<p>Csesar himself was in no condition to resist the sudden
</p>
<p>uprising of an indignant people, leagued to sweep Italy-
</p>
<p>clean of his barbarian hordes. The exiles were greatly
</p>
<p>moved by these bold words, and swore to participate
</p>
<p>in the struggle for emancipation. But Cosimo was
</p>
<p>watching Giulio ; and Gonzaga and Doria, to whom
</p>
<p>Castiglione had revealed everything, had their eyes on
</p>
<p>all the conspirators. The informer paid dearly for his
</p>
<p>treachery. Ventm-ini tells us that he himself (perhaps
</p>
<p>with the connivance of Prince Alberico) killed the
</p>
<p>traitor with his own hand.
</p>
<p>The conspirators, true to their promises, abandoned
</p>
<p>hospitable Venice and went to the posts assigned them
</p>
<p>by Cybo. Ottaviano Zino returned to Genoa, and,
</p>
<p>while studying to seem idle, laboured incessantly to
</p>
<p>prepare the populace for revolt. Paolo Spinola was
</p>
<p>sent to Garfagnana, once subject to the Fieschi, where
</p>
<p>he hoped to find ardent partisans. Others on similar
</p>
<p>missions travelled to other places. Cybo, who had
</p>
<p>supreme command, obtained through the aid of Monta-
</p>
<p>chino a dependent of Scipione Fieschi, three thousand
</p>
<p>gold crowns. The French agents gave him counter-
</p>
<p>signs for the Governor of Mondovi, Candele, who was
</p>
<p>instructed to support the movement with two thousand
</p>
<p>infantry. He then travelled through Ferrara and

<p>Parma to Pontremoli. The governor of that feud,

</p>
<p>raised the cry of Gatto hoping to raise the vassals of
</p>
<p>Fieschi ; but he was struck in the head by a halberd,
</p>
<p>received a wound in his right hand and fell lifeless to
</p>
<p>the ground. He was sent to Milan under a strong
</p>
<p>guard and Nicold Secco was appointed to prepare the
</p>
<p>process against him. The letters of the Fieschi which
</p>
<p>were found on his person left no room to doubt his
</p>
<p>guilt. Some tell us that he was several times tortured
</p>
<p>and confessed that Farnese, MafFei, Ghisa and the Pope
</p>
<p>himself were accomplices in the plot, and that the
</p>
<p>Fieschi and Farnese were its instigators. The emperor
</p>
<p>did not wish to execute Cybo ; and we find evidence
</p>
<p>in documents of the period that even the bloodthirsty
</p>
<p>Gonzaga made every exertion to save him. On the
</p>
<p>other hand Graneville and Doria laboured with all their
</p>
<p>power to secure his punishment. In fact, so soon as
</p>
<p>Doria heard of this plot, committed rather in intention

<p>than act and excusable by the youth of the conspirator,
</p>
<p>" the prince (I use the words of Porzio) inflamed to

<p>wrath by the offence and full of vengeful animosity,
</p>
<p>disregarded the double tie which bound him to the

<p>young man, and made incessant appeals to Caesar for

<p>Many Italian and foreign princes asked grace for

</p>
<p>** His courage and military capacity inspired all who
</p>
<p>knew him'' with the conviction that, if he had not
</p>
<p>perished in boyhood, he would have become one of
</p>
<p>the first captains of his age. He made a single
</p>
<p>mistake : that of endeavouring to expel one foreigner
</p>
<p>with another  to drive out the Spaniards in order to
</p>
<p>establish the French in Italy."
</p>
<p>Zino was not more fortunate in Genoa. His friends
</p>
<p>urged him to flee from the city ; but he, wrapped in
</p>
<p>false security, refused to follow their advice. He was
</p>
<p>arrested and his mangled limbs were found one morning
</p>
<p>on the piazza of the Ducal palace. Other accomplices
</p>
<p>lost their property by confiscation or fell in other
</p>
<p>countries under the dagger of assassins employed by
</p>
<p>Doria, to whom none could deny the right of inflicting
</p>
<p>punishment at his own pleasure. He made free use of
</p>
<p>this privilege of his position. It is certain that he was
</p>
<p>implicated in the assassination of Luciano Grimaldi,
</p>
<p>Lord of Monaco, whom Bartolomeo Doria Marquis
</p>
<p>of Dolceacqua killed with thirty-two stabs. Andrea
</p>
<p>bequeathed this form of justice to his successor. So
</p>
<p>far as we know, no one has ever been able to explain
</p>
<p>why Giovanni Andrea Doria imprisoned his secretary
</p>
<p>Antonio Ricciardi da Loano, whom Spotorno calls one
</p>
<p>of the brightest intellects of Liguria. The unhappy

<p>V/e do not know the fate of Paolo Spinola who was
</p>
<p>declared a rebel and fled to Venice. There is in the
</p>
<p>Genoese archives a letter from him written the 6th of
</p>
<p>April, 1548 to the Genoese government. It paints in
</p>
<p>vivid colours the triple slavery of Genoa to Charles V.,
</p>
<p>Doria, and the bank of St. George which, having lands
</p>
<p>and jurisdiction of a peculiar character, was a state
</p>
<p>within the state.
</p>
<p>Spinola writes :  
</p>
<p>" Your Excellencies having made a public proclama-
</p>
<p>tion, calling upon me to render before you an account
</p>
<p>of my conduct within the term of one month under

<p>having only at this moment come to my knowledge, I

<p>am constrained to ask you as just persons  which I

<p>suppose you to be  to extend the time and give me
</p>
<p>proper space for presenting myself before you, placing

<p>others, (there being many among you who are opposed

<p>to your peace and liberty) so that poor people are no

<p>our masters, prince both in name and fact, and having
</p>
<p>more power than your Excellencies, and I knowing
</p>
<p>him to be a mortal enemy of my family, I pray you if
</p>
<p>you grant my first prayer to hear also the second,
</p>
<p>which is that you furnish me a safe conduct of the said
</p>
<p>Andrea Doria promising me freedom from all molesta-
</p>
<p>tion, direct or indirect, on his part that of any persons
</p>
<p>dependent ujDon him. Furthermore, for as much as
</p>
<p>the emperor, to your shame and mine, takes more
</p>
<p>thought for the concerns of your city than for his
</p>
<p>subject pro\dnces, being in name our friend but in fact
</p>
<p>our master and lord, and since I must pass through his
</p>
<p>dominions to reach your city, I also ask the safe
</p>
<p>conduct of Don Ferrante, the imperial lieutenant
</p>
<p>general in Italy, in the same terms as the former.
</p>
<p>Further, having learned that the administration of the
</p>
<p>bank of St. George has, contrary to all right and pre-
</p>
<p>cedent, added its authority to your summons, I ask
</p>
<p>that the said administration send me a safe conduct of
</p>
<p>like tenor with the others above requested. So soon
</p>
<p>as I receive these several safe conducts, I shall feel
</p>
<p>myself secure against the malevolence of individuals,
</p>
<p>and will immediately place myself in your hands and
</p>
<p>abide your just judgment."

<p>We have esteemed it our duty to give the letter of

<p>the illustrious exile. We leave comment and criticism

<p>The sentence pronounced against him gave rise to a
</p>
<p>PRINCE GIULIO CYBO. 275
</p>
<p>legal cause which has no equal either in its duration
</p>
<p>or the fame of the jurists ^Yho conducted it. Rolando
</p>
<p>a Yalle was the advocate of Fieschi, and the claims of
</p>
<p>the Republic were maintained by Giovanni Cefalo,
</p>
<p>Tiberio Sigiano, Ner\T.o, Menocchio and the college of
</p>
<p>Padua. The case was contested with singular perti-
</p>
<p>nacity, and most princes were interested for one or the
</p>
<p>other party.
</p>
<p>Scipione after the death of Gianluigi, not being able
</p>
<p>to return to Loano which was bequeathed to him by
</p>
<p>his father, because the Dorias had seized the feud, took
</p>
<p>refuge in Valditaro and there, as we have seen, induced
</p>
<p>the people to put themselves into the hands of Pier
</p>
<p>Luigi Farnese. He afterwards visited Rome, where
</p>
<p>the Pope received him privately and treated him with
</p>
<p>great affection. At a subsequent period he was the
</p>
<p>guest of Giulio Cybo in Massa and the two were warm
</p>
<p>friends.
</p>
<p>When Cybo was arrested Scipione saw that it was
</p>
<p>necessary that he exculpate himself before Caesar, and
</p>
<p>he asked an imperial audience through Francesco
</p>
<p>Barca, but the request was not granted. On the
</p>
<p>contrary, when the emperor learned that Scipione was
</p>
<p>charged, in the Cybo process, with being one of the
</p>
<p>chief accomplices he ordered Suarez, by decree of
</p>
<p>March 14th, 1550, to institute proceedings against
</p>
<p>him. He was cited to appear in Genoa for trial and
</p>
<p>obtained a safe conduct ; but afterwards he remembered
</p>
<p>the breach of faith wdth Gerolamo and declined to

</p>
<p>Giovanni Giacomo Cybo-Peirano, and after tlie death
</p>
<p>of this advocate, it was carried on by his son. Doria
</p>
<p>himself employed an advocate to watch the progress
</p>
<p>of the trial and hasten its completion. In the mean-
</p>
<p>time Scipione jDassed into France and entered the
</p>
<p>service of Hemy II. He did not however take up a
</p>
<p>permanent residence there, the jurists of Padua having
</p>
<p>advised him to reside alternately at Eome, Venice and
</p>
<p>Mirandola. We know that he was accused of receiving
</p>
<p>and favouring exiles from Genoa, of capturing Spanish
</p>
<p>ships with his own galleys, of condemning the prisoners
</p>
<p>to the oar and plundering the works of art which these
</p>
<p>vessels were transporting to the empress Augusta,
</p>
<p>The archives of Spain are full of accusations of similar
</p>
<p>character ; but they are the fictions of informers.
</p>
<p>Figuerroa gave his decision on the 28 th of January,
</p>
<p>1552, but for some reason it was not confirmed by the
</p>
<p>emperor, and this gave Scipione strong hopes of being
</p>
<p>reinstated in his father's domains. But Doria and the
</p>
<p>Republic employed influences which overcame the
</p>
<p>imperial scruples and Ferdinand confirmed the sentence
</p>
<p>on the 12th of April, 1559, in such terms as to destroy
</p>
<p>all the hojDes of Fieschi.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in the treaty of Castel Cambrese,
</p>
<p>Phillip II. who had succeeded to the crown of Spain,
</p>
<p>stipulated with Henry II. of France, that all those who
</p>
<p>had been punished with confiscation for aiding either
</p>
<p>crown should be reinstated in their property, jjar-

<p>to Scipione of those feuds which had been seized. l)y

<p>the empire or the Republic. The Spanish monarch
</p>
<p>issued his decree to the senate of Milan ordering the
</p>
<p>surrender of Pontremoli to Fieschi; but it was not
</p>
<p>carried into effect. The senate held that the condem-
</p>
<p>nation was a just punishment for a double treason
</p>
<p>committed both by Scipione and his brothers and
</p>
<p>refused to obey the imperial decree. The queen of
</p>
<p>France who had a high esteem for the young Scipione
</p>
<p>interceded for him, and Ferdinand moved by her
</p>
<p>powerful entreaties on the 13th of July, 1552, invested
</p>
<p>the count with Varese, Montobbio and Roccatagliata ;
</p>
<p>at the same time he signed some other decrees in his
</p>
<p>favour. These various decrees gave rise to the con-
</p>
<p>troversy before the tribunals, with Scipione on one side,
</p>
<p>and the Republic and the possessors of the feuds on
</p>
<p>the other. The count maintained the nullity of his
</p>
<p>condemnation, while the Republic insisted on its
</p>
<p>legality and maintained that Scipione had lost all
</p>
<p>claims to the property confiscated for his treason, and
</p>
<p>that the decrees of the emperor were without force or
</p>
<p>validity. Finally, on the 2nd of August, 1574, the
</p>
<p>emperor Maximilian gave his decision against the
</p>
<p>claims of Scijiione and absolved the Republic, Antonio
</p>
<p>and Pagano Doria, Ettore Fieschi (of the Savignone
</p>
<p>branch) and Count Claudio Landi, who were in
</p>
<p>possession of the lands and castles of the Fieschi.

</p>
<p>Montobbio and the union of Yalditaro with Piacenza,
</p>
<p>he went to the court of Farnese, where he lived for
</p>
<p>some time. He afterwards went to Mirandola under
</p>
<p>an escort of ducal cavalry, and waited there for brighter
</p>
<p>days. Maria della Rovere shut herself up in the castle
</p>
<p>of Calestano. The governor of Parma requested her
</p>
<p>in the name of the duke to leave that residence, in
</p>
<p>order to relieve Pier Luigi from the charge of sustaining
</p>
<p>herself and sons. The susj)icions of the imperial party
</p>
<p>respecting the duke were about this time turned into
</p>
<p>certainty. Cesare della Nave, of Bologna, a man of
</p>
<p>good education who had been created ducal commissary
</p>
<p>in Yalditaro, divulged the fact that Manara had been
</p>
<p>instructed by Pier Luigi to render all possible assistance
</p>
<p>to Gerolamo at Montobbio. Maria then went to Rome,
</p>
<p>and afterwards spent some time in Parma, where she
</p>
<p>dictated her \vill on the 23rd of October, 1553. She
</p>
<p>bequeathed all her property to her daughter Camilla,
</p>
<p>wife of Nicolb Doria who afterwards as we shall see
</p>
<p>took up the conspiracy of Gianluigi. Maria lived for
</p>
<p>several years after the date of her will. The registers
</p>
<p>of the notary Antonio Roccatagliata show that Camilla
</p>
<p>only entered upon the inheritance of her mother on the
</p>
<p>26th of September, 1561.
</p>
<p>As for Panza, we find in some old manuscripts, for
</p>
<p>which we are indebted to the courtesy of the learned
</p>
<p>Baron Giacomo Baratta, that about 1550, he was arch-

<p>the preceptor of Gianluigi, after the destruction of his
</p>
<p>PRINCE GIULIO CYBO. 279
</p>
<p>master s family, retired to some spot secluded from
</p>
<p>political tumults and ended his days in the practice of
</p>
<p>those virtues which adorned his previous life.
</p>
<p>The memory of Eleonora wife of Gianluigi has been
</p>
<p>blackened by recent accusations. After the death of
</p>
<p>her husband, beside herself with grief she threw herself
</p>
<p>into the arms of her mother. The Strozzi papers
</p>
<p>contain a petition adi'essed by her to Charles V. in
</p>
<p>which she sets forth that her dower was secured upon
</p>
<p>the feud of Cariseto, and prays that the emperor may
</p>
<p>command Gonzas^a to deliver it to her with all its
</p>
<p>appurtenances in satisfaction of her claims against the
</p>
<p>estate of Gianluigi Fieschi. Perhaps she did not obtain
</p>
<p>her request ; for we learn from confused notices that
</p>
<p>she did not recover her dower for some years after
</p>
<p>when she invested it in the bank of St. George.
</p>
<p>Some years after Gianluigi's death, she married
</p>
<p>Chiappino Vitelli. Her husband was the son of that
</p>
<p>Nicolo who was killed by Braccolini for stabbing his
</p>
<p>own wife, Gentilina, while she lay in bed beside him
</p>
<p>Chiappino was a brave soldier and a captain of some
</p>
<p>repute. He was a friend of Cosimo, followed the
</p>
<p>fortunes of the empire and received for his warlike
</p>
<p>virtues the investiture of Cetona with the title of
</p>
<p>marquis. He distinguished himself in the affliir of
</p>
<p>Pignone with the Moors, in the liberation of Malta
</p>
<p>from the siege of the Turks, in Flanders and in Holland.

</p>
<p>making the round of his work the Bisogni, who fretted
</p>
<p>at being commanded by an Italian, threw him down
</p>
<p>into the foss, (1575). On receiving intelligence of his
</p>
<p>death, Eleonora gave up her life to pious duties, and
</p>
<p>entered the convent of the Murate in Florence, a
</p>
<p>foundation noted for the illustrious women who fled to
</p>
<p>it for peace, some of whom were members of her own
</p>
<p>family.
</p>
<p>We find evidence that she lived in the same cell
</p>
<p>which had sheltered Caterina Sforza Riario  the heroic
</p>
<p>mother of the heroic Giovanni of the black bands 
</p>
<p>until new were constructed for her at her own expense.
</p>
<p>She ended her days here in 1594, and Alberico L,
</p>
<p>prince of Massa and Carrara caused her mortal remains
</p>
<p>to be placed, with an appropriate inscription, beside
</p>
<p>those of her aunt Catterina, Avidow of Gio. Maria

<p>than manly sustained the siege of her castles by Mattia

<p>Mussulman bullets to the top of Mount Allegro. Other
</p>
<p>pirates infested our waters, and our towns were so often
</p>
<p>pillaged that the inhabitants fled into the mountg-ins
</p>
<p>and left the coasts deserted and uncultivated. There
</p>
<p>was not a hamlet which escaped pillage. The Duke
</p>
<p>of Savoy Emanuele Filiberto while fortifying Mont
</p>
<p>Albano, Sant Opizio and Villafranca came near falling
</p>
<p>into the hands of the Africans. A renegade Calabrian,
</p>
<p>named Occhiali, hearing that the duke was in Villa-
</p>
<p>franca, landed the crews of several galleys at night,
</p>
<p>surrounded the ducal residence, and awakened its
</p>
<p>master with the roar of arms. Emanuele escaped by
</p>
<p>a secret passage unknown to the assailants. The victor
</p>
<p>of San Quintino could ill digest it that he had been
</p>
<p>compelled to turn his back on a pirate. He collected
</p>
<p>around him his pages and esquires, and the first
</p>
<p>peasants whom he met, and assailed the Moors. They
</p>
<p>responded with such vigour as to drive back his little
</p>
<p>band and he himself, after fio;htino^ lone;' with obstinate
</p>
<p>courage, was disarmed and captured ; but two Savoyard
</p>
<p>gentlemen set him at liberty at the price of their own
</p>
<p>captivity. Occhiali returned to his ships loaded with
</p>
<p>booty and prisoners. We learn from the chronicle of
</p>
<p> Miolo that the lords of Morseleto, Gusinengo and Berra
</p>
<p>and the castellano of Valperga lost their lives in this
</p>
<p>battle, while among the prisoners were seventy-five of
</p>
<p>the first gentlemen of Savoy.

</p>
<p>irritated by recent wrongs inflicted by imperial minis-
</p>
<p>ters, took part in the conference and Count Pitigliano
</p>
<p>abandoned the standards of Caesar and promised to
</p>
<p>carry the city over to the side of France. As we have
</p>
<p>said France was to most Italians the symbol of our
</p>
<p>independence, and whether or not she wished us
</p>
<p>well she made copious promises, " according," writes
</p>
<p>Macchiavelli, " to the habit of that nation."

<p>Siena expelled Don Diego Urtado di Mendozza with

<p>his Spanish garrison and established a free government ;

</p>
<p>On the 16th of June, 1554, the Duke of Florence

<p>wrote to the government of Genoa :

</p>
<p>The Republic, forgetful of the generous sympathy

<p>peoples, granted the request of Cosimo and hastened to

</p>
<p>The defence of Siena is one of the most brilliant
</p>
<p>episodes of Italian history. The very women, led
</p>
<p>by Laudomia Forteguerri and Faustina Piccolomini
</p>
<p>emulated the valour of ancient times. But it was all
</p>
<p>fruitless. Leone Strozzi was killed at Piombino, Pietro
</p>
<p>his brother Avas routed at Marciano, and the city,
</p>
<p>deprived of reenforcements by Doria, who beat off the
</p>
<p>French fleet, was forced to yield. The remnant of the
</p>
<p>defenders, reduced from forty thousand inhal)itants to
</p>
<p>six thousand, repaired to Montalcino where they set
</p>
<p>up their fallen Republic.
</p>
<p>The she- wolf of Siena had fallen into the jaws of
</p>
<p>the Florentine lion, but the French trooj^s under the
</p>
<p>command of Flaminio Orsino, Pietro Strozzi, Port'
</p>
<p>Ercole, Orbetello and Talamone remained to be van-
</p>
<p>quished, and the Count Marignano moved upon them
</p>
<p>with a strong army. Andrea Doria supplied provisions
</p>
<p>and artillery and his forty galleys prevented the
</p>
<p>reenforcement or retreat of the French by sea. Marig-
</p>
<p>nano carried the fortress of Sant' Ippolito by storm,
</p>
<p>and successively the castles of Awoltojo and Stronco
</p>
<p>fell into his hands. Chiappino Vitelli, captain in the
</p>
<p>pay of Orsino, distinguished himself greatly at Stronco.
</p>
<p>Strozzi found his position untenable and retired with
</p>

<p>situated near the sea. This retreat discouraged the

</p>
<p>Ottobuono Fieschi was taken prisoner and delivered to
</p>
<p>Andrea Doria. Neither his own great age, nor the
</p>
<p>memory of his bloody vengeance against the Fieschi
</p>
<p>family, softened the spirit of the admiral. It is enough
</p>
<p>to make one's heart bleed to think that he who had
</p>
<p>often spared the lives of Tm^kish pirates, who. treated
</p>
<p>the inhuman Barbarossa with courtesy and released
</p>
<p>Dragut from his chains, ordered Ottobuono to be
</p>
<p>brought to him enclosed in a sack and barbarously
</p>
<p>butchered before his eyes.
</p>
<p>The murder of this brave warrior, captured while
</p>
<p>fighting for national independence, deepened the re-
</p>
<p>sentment in the Genoese already exasperated by the
</p>
<p>sanguinary vengeance taken against the Fieschi and
</p>
<p>the perversion of the Republic. Nor was Genoa alone
</p>
<p>in opposing the Doria government ; the Ligurians
</p>
<p>generally shared the feeling of the capital and the
</p>
<p>Corsicans, suffering under the despotism of our nobles,
</p>
<p>began to show sig;ns of revolt.
</p>
<p>Fregoso and Sampiero shared the perils of Ottobuono
</p>
<p>in the siege of Siena. Aurelio Fregoso and Fieschi
</p>
<p>had laid aside their hereditary enmity at Mirandola
</p>
<p>and set out together for the seat of war. Eleonora,
</p>
<p>widow of Gianluigi, had sealed this new friendship by
</p>
<p>giving in marriage to Fregoso her sister-in-law Lucrezia
</p>
<p>Vitelli. Aurelio was a soldier of great merit and was
</p>
<p>afterwards honoured for his valour. Siena enrolled
</p>
<p>him among her citizens, Francesco Maria, Duke of
</p>
<p>Urbino, invested him with the feud of St. Agata, and

</p>
<p>Sampiero, Fregoso's companion in the vicissitudes
</p>
<p>of a stormy career, was the most formidable soldier and
</p>
<p>captain of his time. The example of the Fieschi whom
</p>
<p>he had known in Rome, Mirandola, Siena and France,
</p>
<p>led him to draw his sword against the Genoese govern-
</p>
<p>ment ; and therefore we may be permitted to touch
</p>
<p>upon the overthrow of his family in a struggle which
</p>
<p>dyed his native rocks with Genoese blood.
</p>
<p>Sampiero was born in humble fortune at Bastelica
</p>
<p>(whence his surname), and Laving studied the military
</p>
<p>art in his youth left his native island and went to
</p>
<p>Home. Here, none excelled him in strength and
</p>
<p>courage. There is a tradition that an Orsini wished
</p>
<p>to dejDrive him of this honour and for the purpose
</p>
<p>challenged him to a joust with a wild bull. The young
</p>
<p>and reckless Samperio accepted the contest and cut
</p>
<p>down his ferocious antagonist. He served successively
</p>
<p>the Florentines against Pisa and the king of France.
</p>
<p>In the latter service his exploits in Catalonia and
</p>
<p>Provence raised him to high reputation. The famous
</p>
<p>defiance of Barletta is far less entitled to fame than his
</p>
<p>great duel at the battle of Perpignano ; but what great
</p>
<p>Italian writer has preserved the memory of that deed ?
</p>
<p>On the evening of the tenth of October 1542, five
</p>
<p>hundred Spanish knights issued from Perpignano with
</p>
<p>flying colours, and challenged the besieging army to
</p>
<p>fight them man for man. Sampiero heard the defiance
</p>
<p>and collected about him some of his bravest knights,
</p>
<p>among whom were Pecchia da Borgo, Francesco da

<p>and other Italians to tlie number of fifty. He led this
</p>
<p>little band to the tent of Delfino the French general,'
</p>
<p>and obtained permission to put his fifty against the
</p>
<p>five hundred Spaniards. The French barons were
</p>
<p>astonished at his audacity, but Sampiero without
</p>
<p>waiting to hear their objections dashed down upon the
</p>
<p>Spaniards with such impetuosity as to hurl them back-
</p>
<p>ward at the first shock. In endeavouring to retire the
</p>
<p>vanquished knights broke their ranks and fell into a
</p>
<p>confusion which enabled the victors to kill many and
</p>
<p>capture a larger number without the loss of a man.
</p>
<p>After this victory, which would be memorable in
</p>
<p>any age, the Italians returned to their tents, where the
</p>
<p>Marshal of France received them with great honour,
</p>
<p>the flower of his knights greeting them with trumpets
</p>
<p>and acclamations. Delfino received them one by one
</p>
<p>and gave them rich presents  especially Sampiero, to
</p>
<p>whom he gave a rich gold chain.
</p>
<p>The fame which he had acquired obscured the
</p>
<p>memory of his humble birth, and he was counted
</p>
<p>worthy to espouse Vannina, daughter and heir of
</p>
<p>Francesco, Marquis of Ornano. He served afterwards
</p>
<p>in the French army of Piedmont and Paul III. received
</p>
<p>him at his court with every mark of affection, when
</p>
<p>after the death of Pier Luigi he was collectina; men

<p>and captains to avenge the assassination.
</p>
<p>The Genoese, suspecting intrigues between the Fieschi

<p>and the Pope, seized Sampiero and he only recovered

<p>his liberty after urgent solicitations of France in his
</p>
<p>behalf. This imprisonment filled him with indignation

<p>and he resolved to revolutionize Corsica. He landed
</p>
<p>in the island, under the protection of French and
</p>
<p>Turkish fleets, at the head of a fine body of Italian
</p>
<p>soldiers and in a few days wrested it from the Genoese,
</p>
<p>who had lost the affection of the people by extortion
</p>
<p>and robberies under the name of imposts collected by
</p>
<p>bands of thieves called tax and excise officers. The
</p>
<p>Genoese government again erred by refusing friendly
</p>
<p>ofiers made by France. Termes, before moving to the
</p>
<p>support of the Corsicans, prayed the Republic to ally
</p>
<p>itself with France on terms which would preserve its
</p>
<p>independence, and he pledged himself in this case to
</p>
<p>suppress revolt in Corsica. The influence of Doria was
</p>
<p>powerful enough to secure the rejection of this propo-
</p>
<p>sition, and though he was eighty-six years of age he,
</p>
<p>with Agostino Spinola for colleague, undertook to crush
</p>
<p>the rebellion. Both parties fought with equal valour ;
</p>
<p>but the siege of Siena called Doria from the Island to
</p>
<p>the coast of Tuscany, and Termes had not a sufficient
</p>
<p>force to conquer the Ligmian power in Corsica.
</p>
<p>At that time, Count Scipione Fieschi lived in the
</p>
<p>court of Catherine de' Medici, regent of the kingdom
</p>
<p>of France. The Republic sent there Tobia Pallavicini
</p>
<p>and Gerolamo Lomellini, under pretence of promoting
</p>
<p>amicable relations with that crown, but in reality to
</p>
<p>intrigue against the Fieschi. But Catherine who had
</p>
<p>induced Hemy II. to insert in the treaty of Castel
</p>
<p>Cambrese stipulations in favour of the family, had not
</p>
<p>changed sympathies and, instead of yielding to the

</p>
<p>ations for the restoration of Scipione to his ancestral
</p>
<p>rights.
</p>
<p>Finding the Republic utterly averse to her wishes,
</p>
<p>she conceived a strong animosity against it, and sup-
</p>
<p>ported the movements of the Fieschi and other exiles
</p>
<p>with a vigour which must have produced great results,
</p>
<p>if the peace with Spain and the Huguenot war had not
</p>
<p>recalled all her attention to home affairs.
</p>
<p>Sampiero was one of the warmest friends both of the
</p>
<p>Fieschi and the Queen regent, and discontented with
</p>
<p>peace he incessantly stimulated the exiles to some noble
</p>
<p>enterprise. Leaving his wife in Marseilles, he visited
</p>
<p>the courts of Italy and Navarre, and even sailed into
</p>
<p>Africa to solicit the cooperation of the Turks. He
</p>
<p>visited the court of Soliman, who, struck with his
</p>
<p>valour, loaded him with presents and dismissed him
</p>
<p>with flattering promises.
</p>
<p>The Republic was on the alert and took measures to
</p>
<p>thwart the schemes of the exiles. Poison and daggers
</p>
<p>had failed, and the Dorias invented another expedient.
</p>
<p>Sampiero returning from the East learned that his wife
</p>
<p>Vannina, under the influence of priest Michelangelo
</p>
<p>Ombrone and Agostino Bacigalupo, had sailed for
</p>
<p>Genoa. These messengers had been suborned by the
</p>
<p>Genoese government to decoy Vannina into Genoa
</p>
<p>under pretence that she might recover the confiscated
</p>
<p>feud of Ornano and obtain her husband's pardon, for
</p>
<p>whose head the Senate had offered a reward of five
</p>
<p>thousand crowns.

<p>that it was likely to create the belief that she went

<p>there by his advice and so to injure his fellow exiles.
</p>
<p>He lamented his misfortune to Pier Giovanni da
</p>
<p>Calvese, who had been the companion of his journey
</p>
<p>into the East, and Calvese informed him that he had
</p>
<p>known the fact for some days, but had concealed it lest
</p>
<p>he should share the fate of Florio da Corte, whom
</p>
<p>Sampiero had killed.
</p>
<p>Sampiero was so angry that he ran his companion
</p>
<p>through and left him dead on the spot. On arriving
</p>
<p>at Marseilles, he learned that the Queen had sent
</p>
<p>Antonio San Fiorenzo in chase of Vannina, and that
</p>
<p>she had been overtaken at Antibo and confined in the
</p>
<p>castle of Zaisi near Aix. Sampiero started at once for
</p>
<p>the castle with the intention of taking 'his wife under
</p>
<p>his own care, but the Count of Provence fearing that
</p>
<p>he would do her mischief left her to choose her own
</p>
<p>course. The magnanimous woman did not hesitate a
</p>
<p>moment to put herself entirely in the power of her
</p>
<p>husband.
</p>
<p>He was mortally wounded by the suspicion of the
</p>
<p>Corsicans that her voyage to Genoa had been a treachery
</p>
<p>of his own, and he had no means of exculpating him-
</p>
<p>self but by taking vengeance for the crime on the
</p>
<p>person of the ofi'ender. But he loved Vannina passi-
</p>
<p>onately and for some days patriotism and affection
</p>
<p>contended for the mastery in his bosom. But Vannina
</p>
<p>knew his perplexity, and came to his relief by imploring
</p>
<p>death at his hands. She gathered about her the

<p>Madonna." Sampiero comprehended her thought and
</p>
<p>fell at her feet covering her hands with tears and kisses.
</p>
<p>Then they entered into a private apartment, and what
</p>
<p>passed between them there is known only to God. The
</p>
<p>servants heard sighs, sobs, kisses ; then a shriek followed
</p>
<p>by a deep silence. Sampiero mounted his horse and
</p>
<p>rode swiftly to Paris. By killing Vannina he satisfied
</p>
<p>the Corsicans of his fidelity, and more, that no afiection
</p>
<p>could withhold him from punishing the guilty.
</p>
<p>The hatred of Sampiero to the government of Genoa
</p>
<p>was doubled by the part it had played in this tragedy
</p>
<p>of his domestic life. He obtained the permission of
</p>
<p>the French Queen to undertake the war of Corsica, and
</p>
<p>formed friendship among the Genoese exiles who shared
</p>
<p>his views, " especially," says Osino, " with a Gerolamo
</p>
<p>Fieschi and Cornelio Fregoso. The latter used every
</p>
<p>argument and artifice to entice Cosimo to favour the
</p>
<p>enterprise and even attempt it in his own name and
</p>
<p>interest." Cosimo temporized ; and Sampiero, little
</p>
<p>accustomed to count up obstacles or enemies, passed
</p>
<p>into Corsica with only two ships and a few companions.
</p>
<p>One asked him :  " In case your ships should be lost,
</p>
<p>in what could you trust for safety ? " Sampiero replied :

<p>"I trust only to my sword."

<p>which he fought against trained troops, always winning

<p>victories. The battles of Vescovado and Pietra di

<p>Among the latter Sampiero found a Giovanni Battista
</p>
<p>Fieschi (of the Savignone branch) and, instead of
</p>
<p>treating him as a conquered enemy, entertained him
</p>
<p>^vith friendly courtesy in memory of kindness done
</p>
<p>him by the Fieschi in France. In fact the Fieschi had
</p>
<p>never refused him any favour; and when he sent
</p>
<p>Leonardo da Corte and Anton Padovano da Brando to
</p>
<p>Paris, in quest of aid, Scipione Fieschi had induced
</p>
<p>the Queen to give twelve thousand crowns and some
</p>
<p>troops.
</p>
<p>The Fieschi favoured Sampiero because they believed
</p>
<p>trouble abroad would render revolution easier at home.
</p>
<p>The energy and valour of this warrior would have
</p>
<p>given the Republic infinite trouble, if treachery had
</p>
<p>not interrupted the progress of his brilliant vengeance.
</p>
<p>Though the forces of the senate in Corsica were large
</p>
<p>and had been reenforced by German and Spanish
</p>
<p>infantry, they seemed powerless before the revolution.
</p>
<p>Two causes rendered them impotent; the desperate

<p>ardour of the islanders goaded to madness by the

<p>agents of the Bank of St. George, and the absence of

</p>
<p>upon death in defence of the power of a few patricians.
</p>
<p>Finding the war going constantly against them, the
</p>
<p>senators resolved to send into Corsica Stefano Doria,
</p>
<p>Lord of Dolceaqua, and they expected him to sink the
</p>
<p>rebellion in a deluge of fire. He was indeed a man
</p>
<p>of extraordinary military talents, and his ferocity was
</p>
<p>still greater. Charles V. prized his soldierly cjualities,
</p>
<p>and Phillip II. created him colonel and knight of St.
</p>
<p>James of Campostella. Emanuele Filiberto, also, of
</p>
<p>whom he was a feudatory, covered him with honours,
</p>
<p>made him councillor and captain-general, and entrusted
</p>
<p>him with the defence of Nice against the Turks. He
</p>
<p>acquired distinction in the battles of Ceresole and
</p>
<p>Cuneo, and this induced the Eepublic to select himfor
</p>
<p>the Corsican war.
</p>
<p>He accepted the appointment with great confidenc'e,
</p>
<p>and swore to exterminate the whole Corsican people.
</p>
<p>He said :  " when the Athenians captured the city of
</p>
<p>Melas, after a siege of seven months, they butchered
</p>
<p>all the inhabitants over fourteen years of age and
</p>
<p>repopulated the island. The Corsicans merit a like
</p>
<p>punishment, and we should imitate the example. Such
</p>
<p>vigour prepared the Athenians for the conquest of the
</p>
<p>Pelopenesus, Greece, Africa, Sicily and Italy ; and only
</p>
<p>by exterminating their enemies did they acquire glory
</p>
<p>for their arms. I know it will be said that such
</p>
<p>severity violates the rights of peoples and the laws of
</p>
<p>humanity ; but why listen to such follies ? I only ask

</p>
<p>with the applause of Genoa, I despise the judgment of
</p>
<p>posterity to which the simple appeal."
</p>
<p>On these principles, Doria bm-ned and devastated
</p>
<p>half the island, but he did not conquer Sampiero. The
</p>
<p>conspu'ator in brief pauses of the battle, assembled the
</p>
<p>people in Bozio and laid the foundations of a Eepublic
</p>
<p>in the fashion of that of Sambucuccio di Alando,
</p>
<p>Doria was recalled ; Vivaldi and Defornari who followed
</p>
<p>him accomphshed nothing of moment.
</p>
<p>The senate, despairing of victory in war, resorted to
</p>
<p>plots against the life of Sampiero. He was riding one
</p>
<p>day with his son Alfonso towards the castle of Eocca,
</p>
<p>when Raffaele Giustiniani, assailed him with a band
</p>
<p>of horsemen. Among the assailants, were some Corsi-
</p>
<p>cans who had deserted Sampiero, particularly Ercole-
</p>
<p>da Istria and three brothers Ornano. They attacked
</p>
<p>him in a disadvantageous position in the valley of
</p>
<p>Ca\To ; but Sampiero told his son to save himself by
</p>
<p>flight and plunged into the thick of his enemies. He
</p>
<p>prostrated Gian Antonio Ornano with the fire of his
</p>
<p>arcjuebus, and was grappling with his enemies when
</p>
<p>he was killed by a musket ball in the shoulder. It
</p>
<p>was believed that Vittolo, his esquire, corrupted by the
</p>
<p>Genoese general, fired the fatal shot. His death did
</p>
<p>not dishearten the Corsicans ; they fought two years
</p>
<p>longer under Alfonso, then only seventeen years of age.
</p>
<p>But finally both parties grew tired of the war and
</p>
<p>terms of accommodation were settled. The exiles now
</p>
<p>lost all hope of recovering their country.

<p>and Count Scipione disinherited, it is not probable that
</p>
<p>Andrea Doria forgot that Pier Luca Fieschi had advised
</p>
<p>Gianluigi to form an alliance with France ; but perhaps
</p>
<p>others anticipated him in that part of his vengeance.
</p>
<p>We have seen that Paul III., having given his niece in
</p>
<p>marriage to Ferrero, invested him with the Marquisate
</p>
<p>of Masserano which belonged to Fieschi. The latter,
</p>
<p>indignant at this robbery, ceased to pay the annual
</p>
<p>tribute to the Pope for Crevacuore. Paul, for this,
</p>
<p>and, says the papal brief, " Also for falsifying money
</p>
<p>in his unlawful mints and other crimes," condemned
</p>
<p>him, deprived him of his feud and gave it also to
</p>
<p>Ferrero. But neither the sentence, papal briefs or
</p>
<p>excommunications sufficed to expel Pier Luca from his
</p>
<p>castle, which he afterwards sold to the Duke of Savoy,
</p>
<p>(1548.) The duke took an oath that neither he nor
</p>
<p>his descendants would cede the whole or any part of
</p>
<p>the county of Fieschi to Ferrero or any person of his
</p>
<p>race. Gregory XIII. absolved him from this oath, and
</p>
<p>in spite of Pier Luca the feud reverted to Basso Ferrero
</p>
<p>and Clement XVIL erected it into a principate.
</p>
<p>We do not know how Pier Luca died ; but the
</p>
<p>manuscripts we consult speak of his end as miserable.
</p>
<p>Almost all the Fieschi patrimony in Piedmont fell into
</p>
<p>the power of the Ferrero, who treated their subjects
</p>
<p>with a severity which strikingly contrasted with the
</p>
<p>paternal government of their old masters and led to
</p>
<p>many seditions and revolts. Urban VIIL, moved by

<p>the Bonfadio who was condemned for infamous crimes
</p>
<p>to an infamous punishment, was indeed an innocent

<p>man, the fact is one of great importance. We are able

<p>period in which he had been a witness of her acts, and
</p>
<p>read them to the elders, who ordered that his writings
</p>
<p>should be deposited in the archives of the city and
</p>
<p>commissioned the chancellor of the commune to con-
</p>
<p>tinue the history. This was done down to 1264, and
</p>
<p>special additions were subsequently made embracing
</p>
<p>a period of thirty years. The increasing rudeness
</p>
<p>of the times, civil commotions in the city and frequent
</p>
<p>changes in the form and personnel of the government,
</p>
<p>arrested the progress of the annals near the close
</p>
<p>of the thirteenth century. Paolo Partenopeo revived
</p>
<p>the work in 1528. The senate appointed him to read
</p>
<p>rhetoric, especially the works of Aristotle on govern-
</p>
<p>ment, " because," says Partenopeo, " politics should be
</p>
<p>publicly taught in a free city." He wrote the annals
</p>
<p>of Genoa, and Bonfadio succeeded him in the same
</p>
<p>office.
</p>
<p>Bonfadio was born in Gorzano, near Brescia, and led a
</p>
<p>life of vicissitudes and suffering. He was secretary to
</p>
<p>Cardinal Bari in Kome and afterwards served Cardinal
</p>
<p>Ghinucci. Beset with many misfortunes, which are
</p>
<p>unconnected with our subject, he wandered to Naples,
</p>
<p>Venice and elsewhere, and finally through Count
</p>
<p>Martinengo was invited to Genoa as a public reader
</p>
<p>of Aristotle. In Genoa his fate seemed to change,
</p>
<p>and he wrote cheerfully of his pleasant sojourn and
</p>
<p>especially of the gentle dames of our city. " It seems
</p>
<p>to me," he says, " that even the Turkish female slaves
</p>
<p>entitle Genoa to be called the city of love."

<p>in all branches of learning induced the senate to give
</p>
<p>him the coveted office of public annalist from the year
</p>
<p>1528. He entered on it with pleasure and completed
</p>
<p>his task in a brief period ; and though he laments that
</p>
<p>the eagerness of the senate to see the work did not give

<p>him time to clothe his narration with such a diction

<p>as becomes history, yet in beauty of style and skill in
</p>
<p>arrangement few Italian""' histories can be compared
</p>
<p>with it. We must regret that the work only comes
</p>
<p>down to the year 1550, in which he met his unfortu-
</p>
<p>nate death. In that year he was torn from his studies
</p>
<p>and his friends and condemned to the flames ; and
</p>
<p>though many gentlemen laboured with the greatest
</p>
<p>earnestness to save him, on the 19th of July he was

<p>302 CONSPIRACY OF crANLUIGI FIESCHI.
</p>
<p>We know that the Bihlioteca Civica of Genoa
</p>
<p>contains some rhymes of a,n ascetic character which
</p>
<p>are usually attributed to Bonfadio, at the end of which
</p>
<p>a marginal note says that he died in prison July 20th,
</p>
<p>1561. This raised doubts about the year of his death
</p>
<p>and some have argued that ho was not beheaded at all
</p>
<p>but died a natural death. A little experience in reading
</p>
<p>ancient manuscripts will enable any one to see at a
</p>
<p>glance that this note belongs to a period much later
</p>
<p>than the sixteenth century. Nor can that record by
</p>
<p>an unknown amanuensis be compared for authenticity
</p>
<p>with the catalogue of the condemned kept by the
</p>
<p>Compagnia delict Misericordia. We pass over the
</p>
<p>rhymes. Except a few sprightly lines, they show the
</p>
<p>devoted ardour of a monk rather than the philosophic
</p>
<p>penetration and chaste diction of JacojDO.
</p>
<p>The cause of his severe punishment was from the
</p>
<p>beginning involved in obscurity, and the lapse of
</p>
<p>centuries has seemed to increase rather than dissipate
</p>
<p>the darkness. He has bcjcn accused of dishonourable
</p>
<p>and illicit love and of ha.ving disclosed state secrets.
</p>
<p>Others tell us that powerful rivals in love caused his
</p>
<p>ruin, and still others that he had incurred the enmity
</p>
<p>of powerful families wh.o instigated his arrest and
</p>
<p>condemnation. His bio graphers give us no light ;
</p>
<p>rather they increase the confusion. But the opinion
</p>
<p>has prevailed that he wa 3 executed for illicit amours.
</p>
<p>The writers who maintained this opinion were of no

<p>great weight, and it is ti Qie to show the inconclusive-

<p>ness of their judgment.
</p>
<p>JACOPO BONFADIO. 303
</p>
<p>The statutes of Genoa attached the penalty of death
</p>
<p>to the crimes of Attic venery, heresy and witchcraft,
</p>
<p>for one of which Bonfadio must have been punished.
</p>
<p>No one accuses him of the last two. Tuano, who is
</p>
<p>quoted among those who charge him with lustful
</p>
<p>crimes, says nothing clearly but only that " Bonfadio
</p>
<p>was punished for an offence which it is prudent to
</p>
<p>conceal {oh rem tacendam). But, besides that many
</p>
<p>things are better concealed, it is important to remem-
</p>
<p>ber that Tuano, who did not even know the year
</p>
<p>in which Bonfadio was executed is a suspected authority
</p>
<p>in Italian affairs. Paolo Manuzio leaves us in equal
</p>
<p>uncertainty ; in his golden Latin song he says that
</p>
<p>Bonfadio perished for a crime over which the sword of
</p>
<p>justice could not slumber, but he does not define the
</p>
<p>singular offence which he also says would not tarnish
</p>
<p>the glory of his name. The only one of his contem-
</p>
<p>poraries who openly accuses him is the base Marini,
</p>
<p>whose verses, worshipped both by princes and the
</p>
<p>populace, invested falsehood with the appearance of
</p>
<p>truth. Cardano took up the tale and no one has yet
</p>
<p>destroyed the basis of the calumny. The judicious and
</p>
<p>impartial critic knows how little value is to be attached
</p>
<p>to any statement by Cardano ; nor can a verse of the
</p>
<p>author of the Adonis be accepted as a guide for the
</p>
<p>opinions of posterity, especially since Garuffi has so
</p>
<p>severely criticized him for traducing the memory of so
</p>
<p>great a writer as Bonfadio.

<p>before they were committed, to doubt that the vice with
</p>
<p>which Boufadio is charged prevailed to a fearful extent.
</p>
<p>Genoa though she had the forms of a Republic, was
</p>
<p>no better than the rest of Italy. Let us admit then,
</p>
<p>for a moment, that Bonfadio fell into the common sin.
</p>
<p>It was neither so new nor scandalous to the senate as
</p>
<p>to have led to his death by fire. Such a charge was in
</p>
<p>the sixteenth century little less than ridiculous. We
</p>
<p>have gone over many volumes of the criminal Ruota
</p>
<p>of the time, and, though we have studied diligently,
</p>
<p>we find not a single case of severe punishment for that
</p>
<p>crime. Whether no cases are found because proofs of
</p>
<p>such beastly crimes are difficult to find, or because the
</p>
<p>vice was universal, is hard to decide. AVe find that a
</p>
<p>Francesco Spinola called the Cahoga, who was brutally
</p>
<p>addicted to the %T.ce was, not burned, but sent to the
</p>
<p>frontiers a few years after the death of Bonfadio.
</p>
<p>Though in 1479, a master workman in coral, who had
</p>
<p>violated a girl in Albaro was quartered with red hot
</p>
<p>irons, the severe sentence was not for the rape, but
</p>
<p>because he had afterwards killed his victim. It is not
</p>
<p>probable then that the government was severe against
</p>
<p>so common a crime, or would have condemned to the
</p>
<p>flames for it a man of such talent and position as
</p>
<p>Bonfadio. Had this been his only ofi'ence, his numerous
</p>
<p>friends in the senate would have encountered little
</p>
<p>difficulty in saving his life. Andrea Doria so lauded
</p>
<p>in Bonfadio's immortal pages, who controlled all the

</p>
<p>therefore believe that the blow which felled him came
</p>
<p>from a higher hand than Genoese law, from a hand
</p>
<p>with which it was idle to contend. This conclusion
</p>
<p>will help us to find elsewhere the true cause of his
</p>
<p>condemnation.
</p>
<p>The most credible authorities of the time tell us that
</p>
<p>he was innocent of these vices, and they add that he
</p>
<p>suffered for secret reasons of state. Some even among
</p>
<p>these writers seem to have been borne down by current
</p>
<p>opinion and doubt if he were not guilty, but they add
</p>
<p>that it was only the pretext for his punishment. Such
</p>
<p>is the opinion of Giammatteo Toscano who wrote in-
</p>
<p>dignant verses against the Genoese for the mm-der of
</p>
<p>Jacopo. Caporali declared Bonfadio innocent. Ottavio
</p>
<p>Cossi and Ghilini tell us that having offended in his
</p>

<p>infamous ardours. It is probably true that he incurred
</p>
<p>the enmity of illustrious families whose names were
</p>
<p>blackened in his history ; Zilioli confirms this theory
</p>
<p>when he says that Bonfadio's history was mortal to its

<p>author. Boccalini states the case with much gTeater

<p>clearness, lilaming the pen of Bonfadio for having

<p>historian ought to tell the truth and to throw down
</p>
<p>his pen when that becomes imjDossible) Boccalini did
</p>
<p>not express his true opinions, and he was afterwards
</p>
<p>run through by the Spanish ambassador in Venice for
</p>
<p>writing freely against Spain.
</p>
<p>Laying aside as untenable the opinion of Marini and
</p>
<p>Cardano, we agree with those who deny that Bonfadio
</p>
<p>had fallen so low, and we find support in the testimony
</p>
<p>of Ortensio Landi, a contemporary of our author and
</p>
<p>a man of gTeat talents, who fell into disgrace at Eome
</p>
<p>for evangelical opinions. He tells us that Bonfadio
</p>
<p>was condemned on false testimony ; and this was the
</p>
<p>belief of the learned of that period. There is in fact
</p>
<p>nothing to support the theory that he was guilty except
</p>
<p>the assertions of writers of little reputation for truth in
</p>
<p>other matters, who were, indeed, only servile retailers
</p>
<p>of calumnies which their authors wished perpetuated
</p>
<p>beyond the tomb. The nature of the penalty, the secrecy
</p>
<p>of the trial and the position of the accused were calcu-
</p>
<p>lated to impress the popular mind with the belief in a
</p>
<p>crime against nature  a crime which famous examples,
</p>
<p>especially that of Brunetto Latini, showed to be the vice
</p>
<p>of literary men and j^uhlic teachers of youth. There
</p>
<p>is, besides, in man an instinct which finds guilt where
</p>
<p>the axe falls. The public and the historians forgot
</p>
<p>one fact, Bonfadio read his lectures in a church and
</p>
<p>his auditors were not young boys. He says that he
</p>
<p>had '"many aged listeners and more merchants than
</p>
<p>Students.''

</p>
<p>The true cause of his condemnation must be sought
</p>
<p>JACOPO BONFADIO. 307
</p>
<p>in his Annals. He probably blamed pretty freely
</p>
<p>some persons who expected great praise. This opinion
</p>
<p>is adopted by Teissier among foreign writers, and in
</p>
<p>Italy by Fontanini and Mazzucchelli besides those
</p>
<p>already mentioned.
</p>
<p>A careful reading of Scipione Ammii-ato will show
</p>
<p>that he really does not differ from these writers. " He
</p>
<p>was punished," says Ammirato, " for teaching political
</p>
<p>principles contrary to those of his time and place,"
</p>
<p>although Bonfadio supported the Doria and Spanish
</p>
<p>party and opposed those who fought for more liberal
</p>
<p>government.
</p>
<p>We must now enquire what persons offended by the
</p>
<p>bias of Bonfadio were sufficiently powerful to satiate
</p>
<p>their veng-eance in his blood ?
</p>
<p>The times were unpropitious to literary freedom.
</p>
<p>Offences of the pen were punished by the dagger or by
</p>
<p>banishment. Boccalini was assassinated in Venice ;
</p>
<p>Sarpi fell under a stiletto aimed by Eome. Oberto
</p>
<p>Fogiietta was banished from Genoa, and if the govern-
</p>
<p>ment could have put hands on him he might have
</p>
<p>gone to the scaffold. Every independent writer was
</p>
<p>the target of powerful malevolence. So fell Bonfadio.
</p>
<p>In describing the conspiracy of Gianluigi Fieschi, he
</p>
<p>used unmeasured terms of reproach against that noble
</p>
<p>family and praised beyond all limit the Dorias and the
</p>
<p>Spanish government. His treatment of the Fiesch^",
</p>
<p>Avhose fate nearly all lamented and who still had
</p>
<p>powerful friends in the Senate, provoked the vengeance

</p>
<p>also of those nobles who were hostile to Doria and
</p>
<p>Spain. All other attempts to avenge the dead had
</p>
<p>failed, and they turned fiercely upon the historian who
</p>
<p>had outraged the memory of the vanquished. They
</p>
<p>charged him wilh a crime which must be punished by
</p>
<p>fire and secured his condemnation.
</p>
<p>Nor did the rage of his enemies cease with his death ;
</p>
<p>for they made every exertion to prevent the puljlication
</p>
<p>of his Annals ; and, though the times were quiet and
</p>
<p>the Doria interest clamoured for the j)ubliciition, their
</p>
<p>enemies kept the work locked up in the public archives.
</p>
<p>It was not published until 1586, (in Pavia by Gerolamo
</p>
<p>Bartoli) that is thirty-six years after the death of its
</p>
<p>author. Though Bayle and Papadopoli assert that
</p>
<p>Bonfadio himself pul)lished it, this statement must be
</p>
<p>put down among the numerous errors of his bio-
</p>
<p>graphers.
</p>
<p>We have seen what was the probable reason for the
</p>
<p>attack of B(.nfadio's enemies ; it remains to investigate
</p>
<p>the pretext which they put forth, since the charge of
</p>
<p>Attic venery cannot be entertaiiied. Two other crimes
</p>
<p>were punished among us by fire ; and as there is no
</p>
<p>ground for supposing him accused of witchcraft or
</p>
<p>magic, Ave are forced to conclude that he was charged
</p>
<p>with holdino; the new religious doctrines which were
</p>
<p>then striking root in Italy. This opinion, so diverse
</p>
<p>from that hitherto held, may seem bold and we will
</p>
<p>briefly consider its proljability.

<p>the way for religious reform. It is known, too, that
</p>
<p>JACOPO BONFADIO. 309
</p>
<p>Italy, seeing herself deprived of politicallibcrty, turned
</p>
<p>her attention to religious freedom as the foundation of
</p>
<p>free institutions. In fact, the reformers among us
</p>
<p>sought mainly to restore democracy to the church.
</p>
<p>The first accents of religious liberty were heard on the
</p>
<p>banks of the Verbano and the teachers were Bernardino
</p>
<p>Ochino da Siena and Pietro Martire. Lucca, Pisa,
</p>
<p>Vicenza and Modena embraced the new doctrines, and
</p>
<p>Ferrara received as a guest in 1535, Calvin, the friend
</p>
<p>of Eenata.
</p>
<p>In the court of this duchess, were found the most
</p>
<p>distinguished of the reformers, among whom were Celio
</p>
<p>Secondo Curione and the beautiful Olimpia Morato, a
</p>
<p>miracle of virtue and wisdom. The religious com-
</p>
<p>munity of Naples contained no less illustrious disciples
</p>
<p>all of whom belonofed to the hi'diest families of the land.
</p>
<p>Some maintain that Vittoria Colonna, Marchioness of
</p>
<p>Pescara, was of the number ; Giulia Gonzaga and
</p>
<p>Isabella Manriquez certainly were ; the latter found
</p>
<p>an asylum among the Lutherans. It is believed that
</p>
<p>Princess Lavinia della Rovere, of the house of Urbino,
</p>
<p>and Margaret of Savoy, wife of Emanuel Filiberto,
</p>
<p>embraced the new doctrines.
</p>
<p>In those days the most cultivated Italians professed
</p>
<p>the boldest doctrines. Vasari tells us that Leonardo
</p>
<p>da Vinci had formed such heretical opinions that he
</p>
<p>accepted no religion whatever. Castelvetro, accused
</p>
<p>of heresy, with great difficulty escaped the grasp of the
</p>
<p>inquisition. Bishop Pietro Paolo Vergerio and his

</p>
<p>held the views of the reformers. Paul III., appalled by
</p>
<p>the rapid progress of the new ideas, with his bull of
</p>
<p>April 1543, established the tribunal of the Inquisition
</p>
<p>in every city, Venice did not wish to suffer it ; but
</p>
<p>Rome strangled Giulio Ghirlanda and Francesco
</p>
<p>di Rovigo, and all the reformers (among them are
</p>
<p>mentioned Trissino, Flaminio, Soranzo and Bembo)
</p>
<p>were forced to flee into exile.
</p>
<p>Many noble men fell in Rome ; Fannio Aonio
</p>
<p>Paleario and the Venitian Algieri. The church was
</p>
<p>saved by sword and fire ; and the ecclesiastical writers
</p>
<p>agree with us in this :  It was the Inquisition that
</p>
<p>extirpated the new doctrines in Italy without this
</p>
<p>intervention of force, the intellectual character of the
</p>
<p>Italians, the well-hnown licentiousness of the Popes,
</p>
<p>the habit of our poets to sport at friars and nuns, and
</p>
<p>the denial by our republics of infallibility to the
</p>
<p>Apostolic See, must have combined to promote the
</p>
<p>complete triumph of the religious reform.
</p>
<p>The church always had great power in Genoa. As
</p>
<p>early as 1253, the friars of San Domenico executed a
</p>
<p>Master Luco as a heresiarch and confiscated his goods.
</p>
<p>The church grew so arrogant that three years later, Fra
</p>
<p>Anselmo, chief inquisitor, demanded that certain rules

</p>
<p>JACOPO BONFADIO. 311
</p>
<p>the Republic. The consuls refused to gratify him and
</p>
<p>the inquisitor excommunicated the city and its district.
</p>
<p>The government sent ambassadors to the Pope without
</p>
<p>success ; it was forced to humble itself and register on
</p>
<p>its statute books laws dictated by a priest. In 1459,
</p>
<p>a decree of the Republic granted every facility and
</p>
<p>privilege to the father inquisitors.
</p>
<p>The bull of Paul III. inflamed our inquisitors with
</p>
<p>extraordinary zeal. The partisans of the new creed
</p>
<p>were increasing rapidly, and the fathers resolved to
</p>
<p>convert or exterminate them. Among the heretics, to
</p>
<p>say nothing of laics, was Cardinal Federico Fregoso
</p>
<p>whose books on the psalms had been entered in the
</p>
<p>index. The prior of San Matteo was accused of heresy
</p>
<p>in Bonfadio's time and cited to appear before the
</p>
<p>inquisition in Rome, in spite of the friendship and
</p>
<p>protection of Doria and the government. It has never
</p>
<p>been clearly proved that Bonfadio shared the views of
</p>
<p>the reformers, but everything conspires to the support
</p>
<p>of that theory. However that may be, his opinions
</p>
<p>were certainly such as to afford his enemies a pretext
</p>
<p>for the accusation. He hated the priests and spoke
</p>
<p>and wrote bitterly against them. His letters, which
</p>
<p>give him the first place in that branch of Italian liter-
</p>
<p>ature, show that he was opposed to all religious orders
</p>
<p>and particularly the regular clergy called Theatine,
</p>
<p>who reciprocated the sentiment and spoke of his death
</p>
<p>as a judgment of God. His annals and the freedom
</p>
<p>of his speech made him many other enemies in Genoa,

</p>
<p>Carnesecclii warned him that one of them had estab-
</p>
<p>lished himself near his person and exhorted him to be
</p>
<p>cautious. Bonfadio replied :  " The man of whom you
</p>
<p>write to me from the Eoman court always disliked
</p>
<p>me His eyebrows are shorn, and he never laughs ;
</p>
<p>wherefore I doubt that He Avho can do all things is
</p>
<p>able to make the man good. He has done an evil
</p>
<p>work, but it was liis own proper work, and if he has
</p>
<p>poisoned the fruits of my labours that was ine^dtable,
</p>
<p>because he bears a serj)ent in his bosom." The serpent
</p>
<p>uncoiled himself and Bonfadio was undone. It was
</p>
<p>not difficult for his enemies to fasten upon him the
</p>
<p>charge of heresy, adducing as proofs his intimacy with
</p>
<p>wicked or heretical men whom Bome had already
</p>
<p>doomed. Among the ffist-class was Nicolo Franco, of
</p>
<p>Benevento, who perished on the scaftbld in Kome,
</p>
<p>prophesying the same fate for Pietro Aretina whom
</p>
<p>that age, after loading him with honours and riches,
</p>
<p>blasphemously called divine. Among the second class,
</p>
<p>that is those whom the church accused of heresy, were
</p>
<p>the Martinengo, who all belonged to the party of re-
</p>
<p>form. We may mention Ortensia Martinengo, countess
</p>
<p>of Barco ; Celso Martinengo, whose letters to Angelo
</p>
<p>Castiglione carmelite of Genoa (written for the purpose
</p>
<p>of converting Angelo to the new party) are extant ;
</p>
<p>Count Ulisse Martinengo who went to Antwerp as
</p>
<p>the minister of the Italian church there when Gerolamo
</p>
<p>Zanchi declined the appointment. Bonfadio was even
</p>
<p>more intimate with Lord ' Bishop Carnesecchi who

<p>embraced the views of Lutlier in the school of Ver-
</p>
<p>JACOPO BONFADIO. 313
</p>
<p>rniglio and Ocliino in Italy and of Melancthon in
</p>
<p>France. Carnesecclii was executed in Rome in pre-
</p>
<p>cisely the same mode as Bonfadio in Genoa.
</p>
<p>Bonfadio writing to Carnesecclii praises his divine
</p>
<p>talents and adds :  " As the Romans preserve the statue
</p>
<p>which fell from heaven, so may God preserve you for
</p>
<p>the edification of many and put off to a distant day
</p>
<p>the fading of one of the first lights of Tuscan virtue.
</p>
<p>May God enable you to be happy and live with that
</p>
<p>cheerfulness which characterized you when we were
</p>
<p>together in Naples."
</p>
<p>He was also very intimate with Giovanni Valdes a
</p>
<p>Catalan, who was among the first advocates of Luther's
</p>
<p>opinions. After the death of Valdes, he wrote : 
</p>
<p>" Whither shall we turn, now that Valdes is no more ?
</p>
<p>This is a great loss for us and for Europe ; for Valdes
</p>
<p>was one of the rarest men in Europe. His writings
</p>
<p>on the epistles of St. Paul and the psalms of David are
</p>
<p>abundant proof of his ability. He was without con-
</p>
<p>troversy a complete man in deed, word and counsel.
</p>
<p>His little spark of soul kept alive his weak and emaci-
</p>
<p>ated body ; his great part, that pure intellect, as if
</p>
<p>outside of his frame, was continually uplifted to the
</p>
<p>contemplation of truth and divine things."
</p>
<p>These words make it highly probable that Bonfadio
</p>
<p>held the doctrines of the man he so highly esteemed,
</p>
<p>and show us that this friendship for the enemies of
</p>
<p>Rome afforded sufficient ground for a charge of heresy.
</p>
<p>This will seem very credible, when we remember that

<p>a canon of the inquisition declared that the smallest

</p>
<p>evidences were sufficient for conviction of heresy ; a
</p>
<p>nod, suspicion or common report, especially in the case
</p>
<p>of a man of letters, of whom Paleario wrote that the
</p>
<p>inquisition was sicam districtam in literatos (a dagger
</p>
<p>drawn against literary men.)
</p>
<p>We conclude then that the religious views of Bon-
</p>
<p>fadio and his friendship with the reformers gave his
</p>
<p>enemies the arms with which they slew him. The
</p>
<p>court of Rome had its hands in the Imsiness, and by
</p>
<p>the same act avenged its political friends, the Fieschi,
</p>
<p>and punished a friend of the reformation. The records
</p>
<p>of Bonfadio's trial were never seen, and there is no
</p>
<p>proof that the criminal Ruota of Genoa condemned
</p>
<p>him. This is a new proof that the whole transaction
</p>
<p>was the secret work of the agents of the inquisition.
</p>
<p>The records of such a trial were not required to be filed
</p>
<p>in the archives of the state. Nor is this all ; the agents
</p>
<p>of Rome had the right to conduct the trial without the
</p>
<p>participation of the civil j)ower, whose duty Avas to
</p>
<p>render a blind obedience to the orders of the religious
</p>
<p>tribunal. This explains why the Dorias who had
</p>
<p>unlimited power over the government, were powerless
</p>
<p>to save Bonfadio, when he was charged with holding
</p>
<p>the opinions of the reformers, among whom we are
</p>
<p>disposed to number him, accepting the authority of
</p>
<p>Gerdesio a contemporary whose statement to that effect
</p>
<p>was not contradicted in his time.

</p>
<p>re|)risals by the friends of tlie former, and Bonfadio
</p>
<p>the illustrious but partial historian of the conspiracy,
</p>
<p>was one of the most conspicuous victims. As Bonfadio
</p>
<p>succeeded Partenopeo in the office of public instruction,
</p>
<p>Giammatteo followed Bonfadio. The Jesuits enticed
</p>
<p>him, two years after his election, into their fraternity
</p>
<p>and they intrigued with such success that the instruc-
</p>
<p>tors of our youth were chosen from their number, and
</p>
<p>men of genius were no longer employed by the
</p>
<p>Republic.
</p>
<p>It is true that Tasso was invited to Genoa with the
</p>
<p>offer of a liberal salary ; but it was the work of private
</p>
<p>citizens not of the government. Torquato received the
</p>
<p>call with pleasure but he did not accept the office. In
</p>
<p>1614, Lucilio Vanini, the Italian Spinosa, o|)ened public
</p>
<p>schools among us. He pursued the system of Bonfadio
</p>
<p>with such success that many young men were affected
</p>
<p>with heretical views and the teacher was forced to seek

<p>his personal safety in exile. He took refuge in France ;

<p>but he was discovered and perished in the flames.

</p>
<p>the Genoese Republic never forgot. Louis XIV. took
</p>
<p>him under his protection, and demanded of the Repub-
</p>
<p>lic the restoration to Mario of his ancestral domains.
</p>
<p>The Senate refused, and he sent a formidable fleet,
</p>
<p>commanded by Segnalai (1684), who bombarded the
</p>
<p>city, and ruined churches, monuments and palaces.
</p>
<p>Innocent XL interposed without effect ; the fierce
</p>
<p>monarch required that the Doge and four senators
</p>
<p>should supplicate mercy in Paris ; that the Republic
</p>
<p>should disarm its galleys and pay a hundred thousand
</p>
<p>crowns to Count Fieschi. The Republic abandoned by
</p>
<p>Spain, was forced to accept these conditions, and Louis
</p>
<p>on his part promised no longer to support the preten-
</p>
<p>tions of the Fieschi. Count Gianluigi Mario died in
</p>
<p>1708, without offspring, and the counts of Lavagna in
</p>
<p>the line of primogeniture ended with him.

<p>We have spoken in another place of the addition to
</p>
<p>our statutes of the law called in derision, Garihetto,^
</p>
<p>the effect of which was to exclude the new nobles and
</p>
<p>the men of the people from political power.
</p>
<p>The artifice was this : The old and new nobles in
</p>
<p>equal numbers filled the public offices, and, the latter
</p>
<p>being the more numerous class, the individuals of it
</p>
<p>held the highest office less frequently than the indivi-
</p>
<p>duals of the old nobility. The rule was distasteful for
</p>
<p>many reasons : it was not made in a lawful way, but
</p>
<p>imposed by the authority of Andrea Doria, when many

<p>of the nobles themselves (says Doge Lercaro) were

<p>opposed to the measure ; and it was contrary to the
</p>
<p>wishes of the vast majority that a few patricians should
</p>
<p>have almost exclusive claims upon the Dogate.
</p>
<p>The people were little pleased that they were now
</p>
<p>totally excluded from that office, to which formerly
</p>
<p>they alone were eligible, while the plebeians "'" fretted
</p>
<p>at the insolence of the_ patricians and Spanish gentle-
</p>
<p>men amonsj us.
</p>
<p>There were new conspiracies. The spies of the
</p>
<p>emperor learned that a Fra Clemente of the order of
</p>
<p>St. Francis had brought back from France some schemes
</p>
<p>for a revolution and Suarez communicated the infor-
</p>
<p>mation to the Senate. The friar was arrested at Ceva
</p>
<p>and, having been tortured, he declared that De Fornari
</p>
<p>was intriguing with the king of France to promote a
</p>
<p>revolution in Genoa. De Fornari, the same who had
</p>
<p>been elected Doge against the wish of the old nobles,
</p>
<p>and who was therefore very obnoxious to that party
</p>
<p>and idolized by the people, was captured and confined
</p>
<p>in Antwerp.
</p>
<p>Such movements led the Senate to distrust the
</p>
<p>people more than ever and to deprive them of the right
</p>
<p>to bear arms. In fact, when Agostino Pinelli was
</p>
<p>Doge, Italian troops were no longer trusted with the
</p>
<p>custody of the ducal palace ; but the Eepublic enlisted

<p>twenty-five years, gave up liis sword to a German
</p>
<p>adventurer and accepted a subordinate position.
</p>
<p>Besides, though the plebeians did not revolt or renew
</p>
<p>the conspiracies of Fieschi and Cybo, the Senate
</p>
<p>endeavoured to ruin all those "who were pronounced
</p>
<p>friends of the ancient popular system. Oberto Foglietta
</p>
<p>having published in Rome, where he resided (1556),
</p>
<p>two books on the Genoese Eepublic, in which he exalted
</p>
<p>the popular citizens over the patricians, declaring that
</p>
<p>the first had served the country with greater fidelity
</p>
<p>than the second, the government declared him guilty
</p>
<p>of felony and punished him with banishment and con-
</p>
<p>fiscation of goods. Many years after, Giovanni Andrea
</p>
<p>Doria, to w^hom he dedicated his eulogies of illustrious
</p>
<p>Ligurians, procured the revocation of the sentence.
</p>
<p>While the Senate banished Foglietta, it praised to the
</p>
<p>skies the ignoble treatise of Pellegro Grimaldi, who,
</p>
<p>though a Republican, taught us to beg the favour of
</p>
<p>princes, and the logic of Lovenzo Capelloni, who,
</p>
<p>adhering consistently to the party of the victors,
</p>
<p>declared that the Holy See owed its fame to the house
</p>
<p>of Borgia.
</p>
<p>On the 25th of November, 1560, Andrea Doria died,
</p>
<p>having lived almost one hundred and one years. The
</p>
<p>nobles called him the father of his country ; but
</p>
<p>Cosimo, the old, was equally flattered. The plebeians

</p>
<p>of which are the misfortunes of Fieschi, Farnese, Cybo
</p>
<p>and a long list of exalted names. He bore arms against
</p>
<p>his country, to dissolve, he said, its alliance with
</p>
<p>France ; but the act was equally in his own interest
</p>
<p>after he had deserted the French service.
</p>
<p>If he emancipated us from France, he took away the
</p>
<p>popular franchises and established the Spanish tyranny.
</p>
<p>He did not wish the office of Doge ; but being the
</p>
<p>minister of Charles V. in Italy and the lord of the
</p>
<p>Main, it did not become him to descend to an office of
</p>
<p>less rank. The magnanimity of his own heart and the
</p>
<p>temper of his fellow citizens alike forbode him to
</p>
<p>assume the supreme power of a prince in Genoa. That
</p>
<p>was probably destined in his mind for Gianettino, and
</p>
<p>only the Fieschi conspiracy saved us from that fate.
</p>
<p>If Doria had wielded his sword and shed his blood for
</p>
<p>Italy as he did for foreign masters, he might perhaps
</p>
<p>have saved us three centuries of humiliation. Foglietta
</p>
<p>proposed to him a more generous service ; to despoil
</p>
<p>himself of galleys, giving them or selling them to the
</p>
<p>Eepublic  an example which other citizens would
</p>
<p>imitate  so that Genoa, having fifty ships in her service,
</p>
<p>could hold French and Spaniards at bay and use the
</p>
<p>seas for her commerce. Such a course would have
</p>
<p>given Andrea the glory of Ottaviano Fregoso, who by
</p>
<p>destroying the forts of the Faro, showed that he loved
</p>
<p>his country better than his personal dignity and
</p>
<p>interest. But the Eepublic saw in her waters a fleet
</p>
<p>which belonged to her sons, while she lacked ships to

<p>protect her coasts from the pirates of Barbary. The
</p>
<p>THE SPANISH DOMAIN IN LIGURIA. 321
</p>
<p>Splendid scheme of Foglietta came to nothing ; Andrea
</p>
<p>spent his life in keeping the seas open for French and
</p>
<p>Spaniards and in maintaining foreign powers. He
</p>
<p>preserved to Genoa the name of independence, but it
</p>
<p>was a mockery. Though he put on our necks the yoke
</p>
<p>of Spain, he was great and strong enough to be the
</p>
<p>only minister and agent of that power.
</p>
<p>A great soldier in the service of the enemies of Italy,
</p>
<p>he stripped the Eepublic of her popular power, founded
</p>
<p>an oligarchy on the ruins of liberty and closed the
</p>
<p>glorious epopee of Genoese conquests in an endless
</p>
<p>succession of domestic conspiracies and political con-
</p>
<p>tentions. Such is our estimate of Andrea. We believe
</p>
<p>that now that the angry passions which his actions
</p>
<p>evoked have ceased to glow, the sentence of history
</p>
<p>should be written with impassable justice. After his
</p>
<p>death, the Fieschi party again took courage. They
</p>
<p>attempted to remove the old nobles from power and
</p>
<p>in 1560 (writes Doge Lercaro) conferences were openly
</p>
<p>held in many places, especially in the house of Basa-
</p>
<p>donne, so that it was necessary to refer the matter to
</p>
<p>the Senate. Finally, the nobles of San Pietro, headed
</p>
<p>by Matteo Senarega, a man of much legal learning
</p>
<p>and political experience whom the arrogance of Doge
</p>
<p>Gianotto Lomellini had driven from the secretaryship
</p>
<p>of state, resolved to renew the Fieschi movement,
</p>
<p>humble the patricians and destroy the Spanish power.
</p>
<p>The contest began in the election of Doge, each party
</p>
<p>wishing to elect one of their own number, and they
</p>
<p>came to blows. The Porch of St. Luca was supported

<p>by its large army of vassals, by the arms of Spain and
</p>
<p>by the galleys of Prince Giovanni Andrea Doria. The
</p>
<p>porch of St. Pietro had the support of the populace
</p>
<p>who hoped to regain their old place in the political
</p>
<p>system of the Republic. In the midst of the quarrel
</p>
<p>(1572) Galeazzo Fregoso arrived with two large triremes,
</p>
<p>and after an enthusiastic reception by the people
</p>
<p>announced that the king of France would give support
</p>
<p>to the popular cause.
</p>
<p>Scipione Fieschi also repaired two ships in order to
</p>
<p>support the revolution. But both found an invincible
</p>
<p>repugnance in the people to a revolution supported by
</p>
<p>foreign arms, and relinquished the enterprise. The
</p>
<p>people trusting in their own stout arms, revolted under
</p>
<p>the leadership of Sebastiano Ceronio, Ambrosio Ccresa
</p>
<p>and Bartolomeo Montobbio, sons of the people. How-
</p>
<p>ever, the life and soul of the insurrection was Barto-
</p>
<p>lomeo Coronato, who though noble by birth, patriotically
</p>
<p>espoused the popular cause. They occupied the city,
</p>
<p>closed the streets with barricades and shut up the
</p>
<p>patricians in thck^ houses. These movements lasted
</p>
<p>for a month, the deputies of the people demanding
</p>
<p>that the laws of 1547 be abolished and the most worthy
</p>
<p>of the citizens inscribed in the book of gold. The
</p>
<p>Doge trembled at the audacious demand and the Senate
</p>
<p>saw no escape from its perplexity until Giovanni
</p>
<p>Battista Lercaro entered the hall and said :  " Since
</p>
<p>you have not been able to save the country from its
</p>
<p>peril and are ignorant of the art of governing, yield

</p>
<p>the spirit of faction and personal interest, you are unfit
</p>
<p>to rule."
</p>
<p>These words of Lercaro, a man of great dignity and
</p>
<p>a noble of the porch of San Luca, frighten ed the Senate
</p>
<p>who promptly declared their willingness to follow his
</p>
<p>advice. But the plebeians always generous to their
</p>
<p>own hurt, answered :  We have not taken arms for
</p>
<p>political power. " We only want the law of Garibetto
</p>
<p>revoked." Whereupon the Senate took fresh courage,
</p>
<p>annulled the odious law, added three hundred families
</p>
<p>to the nobility, abolished an unpopular excise duty
</p>
<p>upon wine and raised the daily wages of the weavers
</p>
<p>three soldi. The populace were satisfied and returned
</p>
<p>to their daily duties, while the nobles of San Pietro
</p>
<p>who had feared a popular tempest managed the move-
</p>
<p>ment with so much addi'ess that they obtained complete
</p>
<p>control of the state.
</p>
<p>But the noblemen of San Luca, as indignant after,
</p>
<p>as pusillanimous before the peril, refused to recognize
</p>
<p>the new laws and, abandoning the city, retired first to
</p>
<p>their castles and afterwards collected at Finale, then
</p>
<p>in the power of Spain. Here they declared open war
</p>
<p>against the Republic, and Mling to obtain assent to
</p>
<p>their demands by the mediation of princes and even of
</p>
<p>the Pope, they invoked foreign arms to desolate the
</p>
<p>country. A powerftd fleet commanded by John of
</p>
<p>Austria, brother of king Phillip, sailed into our waters.
</p>
<p>The old nobles, knowing the hatred of our people to
</p>
<p>Spain, required that the expedition should sail under

</p>
<p>of the enterprise. Meanwliile Giovanni Andrea Doria,
</p>
<p>heir of the political opinions of his Grandfather as well
</p>
<p>as his riches and rank, stormed the castles of Spezia,
</p>
<p>Porto Venere, Chiavari; Sestri and Rapallo ; and with-
</p>
<p>out listening to proposals of peace proceeded to the
</p>
<p>conquest of the western Riviera, capturing Noli and
</p>
<p>Pietra.
</p>
<p>The nobility, whose remittances from Spain came in
</p>
<p>very slowly, was reduced to such extremities as to be
</p>
<p>unable to continue the war. Giacomo Durazzo was
</p>
<p>Doge. Prospero Fattinanti took his place and a com-
</p>
<p>promise was effected through the ambassadors of the
</p>
<p>Pope, the emperor and the king of Spain assembled in
</p>
<p>Casale in 1576. The accord of the two parties of the
</p>
<p>nobility excluded the people from all political power.
</p>
<p>The plebeians were enraged at this new betrayal of
</p>
<p>their cause, and Matteo Senarega who had laboured so
</p>
<p>hard to promote popular rights, prophesied that the
</p>
<p>bondage of the plebeians would be eternal. He wrote :
</p>
<p> " He who is oppressed by a prince yields to necessity
</p>
<p>and to destiny, with the consolation that a change of
</p>
<p>masters may lighten his burdens ; but he who sinks
</p>
<p>under the despotism of a few, assuming the name of a
</p>
<p>Republic, loses his disgust at the tyranny in the sound
</p>
<p>of a word and under a sweet delusion wears his chains
</p>
<p>for ever."
</p>
<p>The old and new nobles now intrigued with such
</p>
<p>success as to destroy the spirit of popular liberty ; and
</p>

</p>
<p>otlier hand, Prince Giovanni Andrea Doria, who had
</p>
<p>dyed his sword so often in the blood of his fellow
</p>
<p>citizens, was called, " Preserver of the liberties of his
</p>
<p>country." To this day he holds that rank in history ;
</p>
<p>but our history must be re-written.
</p>
<p>We have seen that the reforms of Andrea destroyed
</p>
<p>the popular constitution, placed all political power in
</p>
<p>the hands of the patricians, and opened tlie doors of
</p>
<p>the Republic to Spanish supremacy. When the city
</p>
<p>of Finale, exasperated by the lust and avarice of
</p>
<p>Alfonso Del Caretto, shook off his yoke, the dispos-
</p>
<p>sessed lord appealed as an imperial vassal to the Diet
</p>
<p>of Augusta ; and the emperor, far from favouring the
</p>
<p>Republic, which had taken part in the fall of Alfonso,
</p>
<p>decided that the marquis should be restored to his feud,
</p>
<p>compelled Genoa to pay him for the damage he had
</p>
<p>suffered. The Eepublic clamoured against the sen-
</p>
<p>tence, it is true ; but when a few years later Gabrielle
</p>
<p>Delia Cueva, duke of Albuquerque, and governor of
</p>
<p>Milan, garrisoned Finale, Genoa had not courage to
</p>
<p>oppose the measure, and suffered a foreign power to
</p>
<p>intrench itself in the very heart of Liguria. At the
</p>
<p>death of Marquis Francesco (1598), the line of Carretto
</p>
<p>became extinct, and the Senate allowed Finale to pass
</p>
<p>into the possession of Spain, who, not content with
</p>
<p>this, assassinated Ercole Grimaldi, in order to become
</p>
<p>master of the principate of Monaco, (1614.)
</p>
<p>Concpiests and wars were finished, and Genoa had
</p>
<p>scarcely strength to keep down domestic revolt, and

<p>greater part of the conspiracies whicli for almost a
</p>
<p>century disturbed the dreams of our masters, had no
</p>
<p>other object than to restore the popular constitution.
</p>
<p>The free systems were falling throughout the Peninsula.
</p>
<p>The people hoped when the council of Trent was
</p>
<p>opened that it would not only correct the gross abuses
</p>
<p>of the Papal court, but restore the church itself to its
</p>
<p>ancient democratic forms. But Avhen the council closed,
</p>
<p>it was found that no innovation had been effected,
</p>
<p>that a few vices had been forbidden ; but the Church
</p>
<p>remained a monarchy, as Gregory VII. and Imiocent
</p>
<p>III. had left it. Not content vntli this, the Papacy,
</p>
<p>with its famous buU In ccena domini (1567), endea-
</p>
<p>voured to attach all the powers of the world to its
</p>
<p>triumphal car. The fall of the communes was com-
</p>
<p>plete, and the Latin principle was strangled by the
</p>
<p>monarchial and foreign element.
</p>
<p>The Italian states, for the most part subject to
</p>
<p>foreign powers, were changing into monarchies. Italy
</p>
<p>was a province of Spain ; and yet so detestable was
</p>
<p>that power that Navagero tells us, Paul IV. never
</p>
<p>spoke of the emperor or the Spaniards without calling
</p>
<p>them " heretics, robbers, accursed of God, children of
</p>
<p>Moors and Jews, offscouring of the earth," and bewail-
</p>
<p>ing the fate of Italy compelled to serve such vile
</p>
<p>masters. Spain left such fierce antipathies behind her
</p>
<p>that the interjection " Cursed be Spain," came down
</p>
<p>to our times. A wise Pope, Sixtus V., who tried to
</p>
<p>oppose the imperial power, died by poison (1590).

<p>For two centuries, the decrees which regulated Italian

</p>
<p>politics came from Madrid. Naples and Milan groaned
</p>
<p>in chains ; the lords of Mantua, Ferrara, and Parma,

<p>gloried in their shameful bondage. Venice herself
</p>
<p>purchased peace by ignoble sacrifices. Of Rome I do

<p>security of servile ease to the dignity and modesty of
</p>
<p>true art. The money of the great seduced them to
</p>
<p>abandon truth and the people without whom genius is
</p>
<p>neither great nor productive. Pleasure for courtiers
</p>
<p>was their only aim. The country was dying, but no
</p>
<p>voice sang the hymn of death ; no one gave history
</p>
<p>those pages of heroism which save the dignity of
</p>
<p>vanquished nations. On the contrary, Giovio with
</p>
<p>unblushing brow eulogized his golden pen ; Casa sang
</p>
<p>in honour of the Charles V. whom he had once satirized.
</p>
<p>Alamanni apologized to the emperor for his famous
</p>
<p>verse saying that it is the poet's office to lie, and Cellini
</p>
<p>himself could wi^ite :  " I work for pay."
</p>
<p>In this general decline, the ideas of Fieschi did not
</p>
<p>utterly die. Some generous souls continued to protest.
</p>
<p>Let it suffice to cite Tassoni and Campanella, the last
</p>
<p>of whom in his conspiracy against Spain was supported
</p>
<p>not only by many barons but also by the Visir Cicala,
</p>
<p>a Calabrian renegade (though of Ligurian descent) who
</p>
<p>promised to land Turks in the kingdom. Nor would
</p>
<p>we forget that some of our nobles in Genoa tried to
</p>
<p>tear up the poisonous plant which had taken root in
</p>
<p>the Eepublic ; as, for example, Agostino and Francesco,
</p>
<p>Pallavicini, Nicol6 Doria, who married a sister of
</p>
<p>Gianluigi Fieschi, and Agostino Vignolo who during
</p>
<p>the Piedmontese wars intrigued with lord bishop
</p>
<p>Brissac to aid the French arms.
</p>
<p>But the Spanish government, which was destroying
</p>
<p>letters and arts, struck its roots more deeply every day

</p>
<p>in writing it, tliat the Senate issued a decree in tlie
</p>
<p>Spanish language and consented that it should be used
</p>
<p>in lectures and sermons. The plebeians, groaning
</p>
<p>under a double slavery, sometimes appealed to Spain
</p>
<p>against the arrogant despotism of the patricians ; but
</p>
<p>the appeal reacted against the petitioners and Doctor
</p>
<p>Ligalupo, a man of much learning and great virtue,
</p>
<p>was imprisoned for life.
</p>
<p>In the reports of the Venitian ambassadors to the
</p>
<p>Senate, the condition of Genoa is described in a few
</p>
<p>fit words ; Badoero writes :  " They hate the Spanish
</p>
<p>nation as strongly as possible and matters stand thus :
</p>
<p> the people see only France ; those in power see
</p>
<p>only Spain, and none seem to think of the common
</p>
<p>weal."
</p>
<p>With the loss of liberty our manners became dis-
</p>
<p>solute. Courtesans were held in honour. Imperia in
</p>
<p>Rome. Tullia in Venice were courted by men of
</p>
<p>genius. Catarina da S. Celso, Vauozza, Borgia and
</p>
<p>Bianca Capello married into illustrious houses. To

<p>speak of Liguria alone, a brief of Pope Clement VII.

<p>to the archbishop of Genoa and the prior of S. Teodoro,

<p>exhorts these prelates to unite with the government in
</p>
<p>reforming the cloisters, because the nuns have become
</p>
<p>utterly dissolute from contact with every sort of
</p>
<p>persons. The Genoese nuns had infamous repute
</p>
<p>throughout Italy. Bandello says :  They go where
</p>
<p>they please and when they return to the cloister say
</p>
<p>to the abbess " Mother, by your permission, we have

</p>
<p>330 CONSPIRACY OF GIANLUIGI FIESCHL
</p>
<p>passages were opened between tlie cloisters of nuns
</p>
<p>and friars. In oiir times, when the convent of S.
</p>
<p>Brigida was torn down, in the open walls were found
</p>
<p>skeletons of children who had been buried there as soon
</p>
<p>as born. Cardinal Bembo justly said that "all human
</p>
<p>vices and crimes were perpetrated in the cloisters
</p>
<p>under cover of a diabolical hypocrisy."
</p>
<p>On the fourth of September 1551, another brief on
</p>
<p>the corrupt morals of the convents was issued by Julius
</p>
<p>III., but it produced no effect. Gregory XIII., in a
</p>
<p>third brief of the first of July, 1583, made a newj
</p>
<p>attempt to correct the gross immoralities of the cloister
</p>
<p>and the fruitlessness of his efi'orts is shown by the fact
</p>
<p>that he issued another soon after. The Axagonese
</p>
<p>license, penetrating the palace and the sanctuary,
</p>
<p>corrupted everything exalted or sacred; and then
</p>
<p>gTadually difi'used itself among the people, who had
</p>
<p>hitherto been so virtuous that the magistracy of Virtue,
</p>
<p>instituted in 1512, had no occasion to make regulations
</p>
<p>in regard to popular morals.
</p>
<p>Before the Fieschi insurrection extraordinary imposts
</p>
<p>and forced loans were unknown. The customs were
</p>
<p>collected on principles of equity. It was wonderful to
</p>
<p>see the finances in healthful equilibrium, while the
</p>
<p>strife of faction raged so fiercely. The city added a
</p>
<p>fleet and an army to its forces at the cost of only four
</p>
<p>hundred and seventeen thousand lire, and the entire
</p>
<p>income of the government was only four hundred and
</p>
<p>thirty-five thousand lire. Love of country and not

</p>
<p>services were either gratuitous or very slightly paid.
</p>
<p>In 1461, the annual pay of the Doge was less than
</p>
<p>twelve thousand lire, with three thousand more for
</p>
<p>office and secret expenses ; that of the' commander of
</p>
<p>the city guards was only four thousand lire ; and other
</p>
<p>salaries were in proportion.
</p>
<p>But purity of manners disappeared when the foreign
</p>
<p>power was consolidated, and the mechanism of the
</p>
<p>State was altered to suit the character of our masters.
</p>
<p>To pervert the plebeians, the Senate established the
</p>
<p>lottery (the first in Italy) in 1550, under the name of
</p>
<p>Borse della Ventura and it was so profitable to the
</p>
<p>treasury that an impost of sixty-thousand lire was
</p>
<p>collected from it, and the sum. was increased year
</p>
<p>by year until it reached three hundred and sixty
</p>
<p>thousand.
</p>
<p>Genoa, like Venice, committed the great error of
</p>
<p>oppressing her dependencies with heavy imposts instead
</p>
<p>of treating them with generous liberality. As early
</p>
<p>as 1539, a tax of four denari was levied on every pint
</p>
<p>of wine and it soon after increased to eight soldi on
</p>
<p>each mezzarola. Later, that is in 1588, the duty on
</p>
<p>salt was raised to a crown per mina. Three per cent,
</p>
<p>was imposed on incomes, and a tax was levied on fruits,
</p>
<p>and also on paper of which a large amount was exported
</p>
<p>to foreign countries. These taxes were light in com-
</p>
<p>parison with the murderous taxation of our times, but
</p>
<p>they were none the less annoying to citizens unused
</p>
<p>to the visits of tax-gatherers. It had not been cus-

</p>
<p>paid ill proportion to tlieir splendid fortunes or new
</p>
<p>columns were opened in the bank of St. George.
</p>
<p>The governors of this bank, seeing the Republic re-
</p>
<p>stricted to a few families and the Ottoman power
</p>
<p>becoming master of the seas, wisely returned to the
</p>
<p>state (1562) Corsica, the cities of Ventimiglia and
</p>
<p>Sarzana, with its strong castles, the burgh of Levanto
</p>
<p>and the populous valley of Teico.
</p>
<p>Our rich citizens lent their fortunes at hio;h interest
</p>
<p>to the government of Spain ; but the industries which
</p>
<p>had been the life of the people gradually declined.
</p>
<p>In the first years of the century, Liguria was in
</p>
<p>its most flourishing condition. The smallest hamlets
</p>
<p>had profitable industries and trade. On the "Western
</p>
<p>Riviera, Taggia was famous for its Muscatelle wines
</p>
<p>which Alberti says were not inferior to those of Candia
</p>
<p>and Cyprus. The trade in them was very active.
</p>
<p>Oneglia was prosperous, and Diana sometimes pro-
</p>
<p>duced twenty thousand barrels of oil in a single yeai;.
</p>
<p>Albenga, though its air was unwholesome (whence the
</p>
<p>proverb of the time,) " Albenga plana, se fosse sana si
</p>
<p>domanderebbe stella Diana," was rich in the produce
</p>
<p>of its fruitful soil. There was universal movement,
</p>
<p>industry, wealth. But it was of short duration ; the
</p>
<p>new system of government dried up all the fountains
</p>
<p>of our riches. In 1597, Genoa was reduced to sixty-
</p>
<p>one thousand inhabitants ; Savona which had once
</p>
<p>counted thirty-six thousand citizens, in 1560 numbered
</p>
<p>only fourteen thousand, and in 1625, the number had

</p>
<p>fallen to eight thousand. The decrease was in this
</p>
<p>THE SPANISH DOMAIN IN LIGURIA. 333
</p>
<p>proportion tlirougliout the Eepublic. Campanella had
</p>
<p>good cause to say to Genoa :  " Leave your markets,
</p>
<p>your gains, your barren glories ! Blush for the riches
</p>
<p>of your citizens which contrast so terribly with the
</p>
<p>misery of the Republic."
</p>
<p>The foreign influence slowly killed the manly virtues
</p>
<p>of the Genoese. Italy no longer existed. We had a
</p>
<p>corrupt people in a corrupt state. All care was given
</p>
<p>to externals ; every free thought was a crime ; we were
</p>
<p>vile and called our vileness love of peace, and our in-
</p>
<p>dolence, moderation ; religion had become a superstition,
</p>
<p>and the rites of the church merely a ladder to worldly
</p>
<p>preferment. Luxury and parade were unparalleled ;
</p>
<p>but poverty was seen tlu:ough the pompous vestments.
</p>
<p>The first born was rich, but his brothers were usurers or
</p>
<p>celibates in the cloisters. In their vanity and degrada-
</p>
<p>tion, the great forgot that they had a country. Trade
</p>
<p>seemed ignominious to our princes and nobles, and they
</p>
<p>believed that their names at the foot of a bill of
</p>
<p>exchange would make a bad figure in history. This
</p>
<p>beggared many families to whom false pride closed
</p>
<p>the paths by which their fathers had become great.
</p>
<p>Knightly virtues disappeared ; noble blood alone opened
</p>
<p>the paths to eminence, and this was carried to such
</p>
<p>extremes that our patricians refused to have for arch-
</p>
<p>bishop Belmosto, only because his name was not in the
</p>
<p>book of gold. They were at once proud and ridiculous.
</p>
<p>In 1576, a Nicolo Doria became Doge and first took

</p>
<p>however illustrious and wealthy they might be  by
</p>
<p>the title Magnifico. The notarial profession''' itself
</p>
<p>was pronounced in certain cases ignoble and mechanical.
</p>
<p>In the smaller towns the same folly prevailed. In
</p>
<p>Ventimiglia and Finale, there were streets, porches
</p>
<p>and walks to which the plebeians were not admitted.
</p>
<p>Genoa was only a shadow, a pretence of a Eepublic.
</p>
<p>Our wars and intestine struggles, our magnanimous
</p>
<p>enterprises abroad, were succeeded by a ser^dle tran-
</p>
<p>quility. Our masters preferred their gilded saloons to
</p>
<p>the dust of honourable fields ; they lent their money
</p>
<p>at usurious interest, and got titles and degrading pre-
</p>
<p>miums for their baseness. There were, it is true, some
</p>
<p>naval engagements, but there were no real wars. And
</p>
<p>this was the supreme misfortune ; for long peace wastes
</p>
<p>the strength of peoples and destroys both the habit
</p>
<p>and the courage of noble enterprises. There lingered
</p>
<p>among us arts, letters, wealth and trade ; Ijut the
</p>
<p>manly virtues were extinct.
</p>
<p>The foreign lejDrosy gradually changed the character
</p>
<p>of our plebeians ; they began to tremble before the
</p>
<p>powerful from whom they were separated by an
</p>
<p>immense interval. The two classes had nothing in
</p>
<p>common but vices and the habit of servility. Uni-
</p>
<p>versal corruption produced great crimes and long
</p>
<p>catalogues of malefactors were often published. Nor
</p>
<p>was this in Liguria alone ; all the provinces of the
</p>
<p>Peninsula were involved in a common demoralization.

<p>the cities. They were led hj trained warriors such
</p>
<p>as Alfonso Piccolomini, Corsietto del Sambuco  who
</p>
<p>ventured to the very gates of Rome  and Marco Sciarra
</p>
<p>who in Calabria took the title of king. Let no one
</p>
<p>suppose that the numerous altars, crucifixes and images
</p>
<p>of Mary prove the piety of our ancestors. They are
</p>
<p>witnesses for quite the contrary; in the midst of
</p>
<p>innumerable crimes perpetrated in open day, these
</p>
<p>religious emblems protected the citizen from the knife
</p>
<p>of the assassin who was too superstitious to smite him
</p>
<p>at the foot of the altar.
</p>
<p>Eeligion was then only a superstition and a terror.
</p>
<p>A multitude of books appeared full of the wildest
</p>
<p>vagaries that fanaticism ever produced. For example,
</p>
<p>there were the prophecies of S. Brigida threatening the
</p>
<p>city with destruction ! and through such follies the
</p>
<p>cunning generation of men, who live upon hypocrisy,
</p>
<p>mystery and the dead, amassed large fortunes. Their
</p>
<p>instructions were idle speculations and appeals to
</p>
<p>human fears. In those days, patrician and Jesuit
</p>
<p>intrio'ues collected their followers in a little church
</p>
<p>situated in the Corsa del Diavolo and bound them-
</p>
<p>selves by an oath to support for public offices only
</p>
<p>those of their own faction. An opposite faction organ-
</p>
<p>ized, and from their standard  a black crucifix  were

</p>
<p>with these vices like a species of leprosy. The in-
</p>
<p>habitants of Borsonasca acquired a wide reputation

<p>for shrewd frauds and deceptions. They understood

<p>every sleight of hand, lea'rned foreign tongues and

<p>imitated them with admirable skill; they had cunning
</p>
<p>artifices for getting other people's pm'ses, and they
</p>
<p>travelled in every country in Europe. Though born
</p>
<p>in the woods, they entered boldly the palaces of nobles
</p>
<p>and even of princes, dressed as physicians, merchants,
</p>
<p>bishops and cardinals. They sold charms, medicines,

<p>false titles and privileges "v\dth such perfect art that
