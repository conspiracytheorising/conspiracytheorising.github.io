<p>THE HERRIN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>Acomprehensivestoryoftheslaughter
</p>
<p>as presented by investigators
</p>
<p>and eye-witnesses
</p>
<p>IN a wooded grove midway between the
</p>
<p>mining towns of Herrin and Marion
</p>
<p>in Williamson County, 111., a crime was
</p>
<p>committed on the morning of Thursday,
</p>
<p>June 22, that stirred the indignation
</p>
<p>and aroused the horror of America as
</p>
<p>had not been done since the stories of
</p>
<p>war atrocities committed by the Huns
</p>
<p>ceased coming across the ocean.
</p>
<p>Nearly fifty men  the exact number is
</p>
<p>uncertain  who shortly before had been
</p>
<p>taken out under a flag of truce from the
</p>
<p>| strip mine of the Southern Illinois Coal
</p>
<p>Company a few miles away and who had
</p>
<p>been promised that they would be fur-
</p>
<p>nished safe escort to the railroad station
</p>
<p>whence they could entrain for their homes,
</p>
<p>were lined up in front of a barbed wire
</p>
<p>fence, and hemmed in by union miners in
</p>
<p>military formation.
</p>
<p>Scarcely before a plea of mercy could
</p>
<p>t>e made, shotguns, rifles and revolvers
</p>
<p>in the hands of 500 men arrayed in a
</p>
<p>semi-circle about the miserable group,
</p>
<p>poured a storm of lead into the bodies
</p>
<p>of the captives. Many fell at the first
</p>
<p>volley. Some got through the fence only
</p>
<p>to be shot down in flight. Others es-
</p>
<p>| caped the fusillade to fall victims later to
</p>
<p>a savage man hunt that harried the fugi-

</p>
<p>tives for hours through the surrounding
</p>
<p>countryside. Some of- the dead were
</p>
<p>mutilated, the dying were kicked and
</p>
<p>beaten, the captured were tortured and
</p>
<p>then slain.
</p>
<p>When the ghastly work was over, nine-
</p>
<p>teen of those who were working in the
</p>
<p>mine were dead, several died later of the
</p>
<p>'89900
</p>
<p>34 who were wounded and a number are
</p>
<p>still unaccounted for. Such was the out-
</p>
<p>rage committed in a union district upon
</p>
<p>men who were merely exercising the uni-
</p>
<p>versal law of the right to labor and who
</p>
<p>had been employed by William J. Lester,
</p>
<p>president of the coal company, to operate
</p>
<p>the strip mine from which the members of
</p>
<p>the United Mine Workers of America had .
</p>
<p>walked out.
</p>
<p>An Attack on Government
</p>
<p>This organized murder of American
</p>
<p>citizens was the result of the determina-
</p>
<p>tion of a branch of the United Mine
</p>
<p>Workers of America to maintain as an
</p>
<p>absolute stronghold the supremacy of the
</p>
<p>Miners' Union in Williamson County ov^
</p>
<p>and above the law of the State and the
</p>
<p>law of the Nation.
</p>
<p>It was anarchy; it was the placing of
</p>
<p>the aim of the union as the supreme Jaw
</p>
<p>of Williamson County. It was a vicious
</p>
<p>attack upon the fundamental principjles
</p>
<p>upon which our Government was founded q
</p>
<p>The right of any American to do his work*
</p>
<p>a basic principle of our Constitution which
</p>
<p>guarantees liberty and protection, if
</p>
<p>an issue far above any question betwee
</p>
<p>the United Mine Workers and opera
</p>
<p>tors, and it concerns not only the eoa
</p>
<p>miners and coal operators, but every man
</p>
<p>and woman in this country. It concerns
</p>
<p>every industry, every home.
</p>
<p>What does this uprising mean? It is
</p>
<p>the concern of every citizen of the land.

</p>
<p>Every American must view this crime
</p>
<p>with the utmost concern, for the issue
</p>
<p>involves the very foundations of our Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment. What happened in William-
</p>
<p>son County may happen in almost
</p>
<p>any community in the country, if every
</p>
<p>effort is not put forth to bring the assas-
</p>
<p>sins to justice. Indeed, it was the boast
</p>
<p>4
</p>
<p>il
</p>
<p>of the organized band who committed this
</p>
<p>murder that in Williamson County, at
</p>
<p>least, America would be shown that the
</p>
<p>law of the union reigned supreme.
</p>
<p>These murders grew out of what has
</p>
<p>every appearance  from the bare facts
</p>
<p>collected  of a well-organized conspiracy
</p>
<p>to stop the operation of the strip mine.
</p>
<p>The investigation indicates that the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy was developed over a period of
</p>
<p>four or five days during which the senti-
</p>
<p>ment of the members of the mine workers'
</p>
<p>union in Williamson County was intensive-
</p>
<p>ly developedagainst the strip mine workers.
</p>
<p>Plans for the attack were carefully laid.
</p>
<p>Then the assault began. This assault was
</p>
<p>interrupted by a truce arranged in accord-
</p>
<p>ance with the wishes of the officials of
</p>
<p>the United Mine Workers of America, and
</p>
<p>the County officials acquiesced, as did the
</p>
<p>owner of the mine who agreed that no at-
</p>
<p>tempt would be made to reopen the mine
</p>
<p>during the strike.
</p>
<p>The facts relating to the whole affair
</p>
<p>have been assembled here in order to give
</p>
<p>a picture of the situation in Williamson
</p>
<p>County and a comprehensive story of
</p>
<p>what happened.
</p>
<p>A Union Stronghold
</p>
<p>Williamson County, Illinois, which has
</p>
<p>a population of 61,038, is in one of the
</p>
<p>most strongly unionized centers of Amer-
</p>
<p>ica. Marion, the county seat, has a pop-
</p>
<p>ulation of 9,582, and Herrin, a population
</p>
<p>of 10,986. It is conservatively estimated

</p>
<p>that 85 per cent of the residents of the
</p>
<p>County are miners or connected with them
</p>
<p>byiamily ties or otherwise, and reflecting
</p>
<p>unionized labor sentiment. All business
</p>
<p>conducted in the County is dependent to
</p>
<p>a vital degree upon the patronage of the
</p>
<p>mining element. The mining vote elects
</p>
<p>or defeats candidates for public office.
</p>
<p>Many of the public officials holding
</p>
<p>elective office are miners, ; iave been
</p>
<p>miners, or are in strong sympathy with
</p>
<p>union labor whose strength is such that,
</p>
<p>without question, it is its vote that elects
</p>
<p>or defeats any candidate for. local or
</p>
<p>county office.
</p>
<p>The most outstanding local figure in the
</p>
<p>events leading up to the massacre, is
</p>
<p>Sheriff Melvin Thaxton, who persistently
</p>
<p>refused to swear his deputies or to call
</p>
<p>for the Illinois National Guard, as he
</p>
<p>was urged to do repeatedly by Col. S.N.
</p>
<p>Hunter, representing Adjutant General
</p>
<p>Carlo Black of Illinois, for three days be-
</p>
<p>fore the surrender and butchery of the
</p>
<p>strip miners. Col. Hunter had arrived
</p>
<p>in Marion on June 18 to keep an eye on
</p>
<p>the situation. The Sheriff is an ex-
</p>
<p>miner, and was elected by the mining
</p>
<p>vote, and is now a candidate for county
</p>
<p>treasurer.
</p>
<p>There is ample testimony that Sheriff
</p>
<p>Thaxton is physically not a coward. In
</p>
<p>times past he has been cool, courageous
</p>
<p>and vigilant in supporting the law. Single-
</p>
<p>handed he stopped thirteen prisoners in a
</p>
<p>jail-breaking attempt two years ago. He
</p>
<p>has to his credit successful intervention
</p>
<p>m a number of attempted lynchings. .
</p>
<p>The Judge and the Mob
</p>
<p>County Judge Hartwell draws a picture
</p>
<p>of the mob which shows its caliber when
</p>
<p>met by a determined spirit. A crowd
</p>
<p>went to the Judge's home. They de-

</p>
<p>manded that he deliver over to them his
</p>
<p>collection of firearms. He dared the
</p>
<p>young fellows to come and get them, at
</p>
<p>the same time directing his wife to load
</p>
<p>as he fired. The mob faded away.
</p>
<p>Prominent also in the three days pre-
</p>
<p>ceding the attack on the mine was State
</p>
<p>Senator William J. Sneed, president of
</p>
<p>6
</p>
<p>\
</p>
<p>the Sub-District of the United Mine
</p>
<p>Workers of America  a resident of Her-
</p>
<p>. rin. He appears to be the leading poli-
</p>
<p>tician of the County, insofar as the labor
</p>
<p>vote is concerned. The labor vote, which
</p>
<p>in a previous election had been led by
</p>
<p>Sneed in the interests of another political
</p>
<p>faction, was reversed under Sneed 's con-
</p>
<p>trol and support thrown to Len Small,
</p>
<p>successful candidate for Governor.
</p>
<p>The State's Attorney of Williamson
</p>
<p>County is Delos L. Duty, whose family
</p>
<p>has been slightly identified with union
</p>
<p>miner interests. Duty, who was elected
</p>
<p>by miners' votes, is on record as express-
</p>
<p>ing very serious doubt of his ability to
</p>
<p>convict mob conspirators, leaders and
</p>
<p>members of the mob. "To get a jury
</p>
<p>I not imbued with the ideas of the labor
</p>
<p>unions will be impossible, I believe," he
</p>
<p>said, and added, "the killing was un-
</p>
<p>human beyond words."
</p>
<p>Brundage Infers Conspiracy
</p>
<p>Edward J. Brundage, Attorney Gen-
</p>
<p>eral of Illinois, views the Herrin massacre
</p>
<p>as "murder in cold blood after the strip
</p>
<p>miners had surrendered." That the At-
</p>
<p>torney General believes a conspiracy ex-
</p>
<p>isted is the inference to be drawn from his
</p>
<p>statement that "the riot was not spon-
</p>
<p>taneous; the mob gathered from several
</p>
<p>counties at a central spot."
</p>
<p>William M. McCown of Marion, the
</p>
<p>Coroner of Williamson County, was a

</p>
<p>union miner and is admittedly a union
</p>
<p>sympathizer.
</p>
<p>The principal business of Williamson
</p>
<p>County is digging coal from deep mines,
</p>
<p>of which there are thirty- two. There are
</p>
<p>also four strip mines where huge shovels
</p>
<p>scrape the earth from thick veins of coal
</p>
<p>which run near the surface. Other
</p>
<p>shovels then lift this coal into cars. It
</p>
<p>I
</p>
<p>was against the strip mine, owned by the
</p>
<p>Southern Illinois Coal Company, of which
</p>
<p>William J. Lester is president, that mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the United Mine Workers of
</p>
<p>America directed an attack. As an op-
</p>
<p>erator Mr. Lester played a lone hand,
</p>
<p>and was not a member of any coal oper-
</p>
<p>ators' association.
</p>
<p>Strip Shovels Continue Work
</p>
<p>When the deep mines were closed by
</p>
<p>the U. M. W. of A. strike April 1, last,
</p>
<p>the stripping shovel at the Lester mine
</p>
<p>did not cease operations. The stripping
</p>
<p>shovel was kept at work, meantime, and
</p>
<p>no objection was made by the strikers as
</p>
<p>long as no attempt to mine coal was made.
</p>
<p>Men manning this shovel, or rather the
</p>
<p>crews operating it, were members of the
</p>
<p>Steam Shovel Men's Union, an organiza-
</p>
<p>tion not affiliated with the American
</p>
<p>Federation of Labor.
</p>
<p>About June 10 Lester made preparation
</p>
<p>actually to dig and load coal and addi-
</p>
<p>tional men, some of whom were rated as
</p>
<p>track layers and others as guards, were
</p>
<p>put on the property. This development
</p>
<p>was instantly resented by the union
</p>
<p>miners, and the question arose as to the
</p>
<p>status of the men employed at the strip
</p>
<p>mine. There was also the openly voiced
</p>
<p>feeling of resentment that armed guards
</p>
<p>were on duty at these strip mines.
</p>
<p>As early as June 13, it became mani-
</p>
<p>fest that a plot against the mine was

</p>
<p>brewing. Robert Tracy, of Chicago, a
</p>
<p>locomotive engineer, reported to the mine
</p>
<p>for duty, and in examining the engine
</p>
<p>firebox found ten sticks of dynamite and
</p>
<p>two cans of powder therein. Two days
</p>
<p>later, says Tracy, picketing of the mine
</p>
<p>began.
</p>
<p>The Sheriff and State's Attorney and
</p>
<p>U. M. W. of A. officials protested to Mr.
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>Lester and his superintendent, C. K.
</p>
<p>McDowell, against the employment of
</p>
<p>these armed guards; said that they were
</p>
<p>trespassing on public property and hold-
</p>
<p>ing up traffic. The strip mine people
</p>
<p>were told that they were courting destruc-
</p>
<p>tion, if they continued to dig coal. There
</p>
<p>is on record the statement that McDowell
</p>
<p>declared that if any guards were outside
</p>
<p>the mine boundary they were disobeying
</p>
<p>his instructions. It was also said by some
</p>
<p>who conferred with him that he promised
</p>
<p>to disarm the guards, but this is not veri-
</p>
<p>fied.
</p>
<p>There was talk of boycotting stores
</p>
<p>which were supplying the men with pro-
</p>
<p>visions, and the union miners also were
</p>
<p>sent to watch railroad stations where addi-
</p>
<p>tional workmen for the strip mine might
</p>
<p>arrive. Col. Hunter notes that two of
</p>
<p>these workers, detraining at Marion, were
</p>
<p>intercepted by union miners and ordered
</p>
<p>away, and did leave.
</p>
<p>The Telegram from Lewis
</p>
<p>There was discussion among the strikers
</p>
<p>as to the status of the strip mine workers.
</p>
<p>On June 18, Senator Sneed wired John
</p>
<p>L. Lewis, International President of the
</p>
<p>U. M. W. of A., asking for an official rul-
</p>
<p>ing on the status of the strip mine work-
</p>
<p>ers. Sneed received the following reply:
</p>
<p>Indianapolis, Ind.

<p>at numerous strip pits in Ohio. This or-

<p>tives, officially taken this question up
</p>
<p>with the officers of the Steam Shovel

<p>Men's Union and have failed tosecureany

<p>satisfaction . Representatives of our organi-

<p>zation are justified in treating this crowd
</p>
<p>as an outlaw organization and in view-

<p>ing its members in the same light as they
</p>
<p>do any other common strike breakers.

<p>discuss a program of action against the
</p>
<p>strip mine workers, it is related by Col.
</p>
<p>Hunter, was held early Tuesday after-
</p>
<p>noon, June 20. He was informed that the
</p>
<p>miners were in session at the Sunnyside
</p>
<p>Mine. Col. Hunter avers that he went
</p>
<p>to the office of State Senator Sneed and
</p>
<p>10
</p>
<p>told the latter of the meeting, whereupon
</p>
<p>. Sneed replied:
</p>
<p>"I know about it. There is no cause
</p>
<p>for alarm."
</p>
<p>Col. Hunter says that a little later he
</p>
<p>told Sheriff Thaxton of this miners' mass
</p>
<p>meeting and asked the Sheriff to send a
</p>
<p>deputy, who resided in Herrin, to the
</p>
<p>meeting and ascertain what was going on.
</p>
<p>The Sheriff promised to do this, Col.
</p>
<p>Hunter says. There seems to exist a
</p>
<p>strong probability that some definite ac-
</p>
<p>tion against operations at the strip mine
</p>
<p>was agreed upon at this Tuesday mass
</p>
<p>meeting.
</p>
<p>The next day another meeting took
</p>
<p>place. Of what was done at this meeting
</p>
<p>i and of the effect actually had on the minds
</p>
<p>of the miners and their friends, the
</p>
<p>Marion Daily Republican of June 22,
</p>
<p>said:
</p>
<p>Meeting in Cemetery
</p>
<p>"An indignation meeting was held in
</p>
<p>< the cemetery in Herrin on Wednesday
</p>
<p>morning, June 21, at which time the
</p>
<p>feeling was running high, and the tele-
</p>
<p>gram of John L. Lewis calling these
</p>
<p>shovel men common strike breakers, was
</p>
<p>read. Soon afterwards a mob raided three
</p>
<p>hardware stores in Herrin, obtaining a
</p>
<p>few guns and rifles and 5,000 rounds of
</p>
<p>ammunition of all kinds."

<p>in his publication:
</p>
<p>"The trouble (the massacre) followed
</p>
<p>after an indignation meeting was held just
</p>
<p>outside of Herrin on a road to the mine
</p>
<p>Wednesday morning following the publi-
</p>
<p>cation of a telegram from John L. Lewis,
</p>
<p>president of the United Mine Work-
</p>
<p>ers, which stated that the workmen at
</p>
<p>the strip mine who are members of the
</p>
<p>11
</p>
<p>Shovel Men's Union were 'common strike
</p>
<p>breakers.' "
</p>
<p>Writing from Ilerrin, Thoreau Cron; n
</p>
<p>said in the New York Herald of July 12:
</p>
<p>"A veteran of Williamson County to
</p>
<p>whom the correspondent showed the copy
</p>
<p>of this (Lewis') telegram, pushed his
</p>
<p>spectacles up on his forehead after reading
</p>
<p>it and said:
</p>
<p>" * Everybody down here knows how the
</p>
<p>union miners felt about this and how cer-
</p>
<p>tain words inflame them. I should not
</p>
<p>say that the word outlaw riled them so
</p>
<p>much, but when Lewis officially told
</p>
<p>them that those fellows out at the Lester
</p>
<p>mine were to be treated like any other
</p>
<p>strike breakers, I should say that it was
</p>
<p>about the same thing as saying: 'Hike
</p>
<p>out there to the mine and clean 'em
</p>
<p>out.' "
</p>
<p>Prominent business men of Marion and
</p>
<p>Herrin say that when they heard the men
</p>
<p>on the streets and in business places talk-
</p>
<p>ing excitedly about the message from
</p>
<p>Lewis that they felt certain a violent out-
</p>
<p>break was but hours distant.
</p>
<p>Out of these meetings meantime the
</p>
<p>conspiracy to stop the operation of the
</p>
<p>mine had been developed. The initial
</p>
<p>move to invest the strip mine has all the
</p>
<p>ear-marks of an organized effort and it re-
</p>
<p>sulted in the first open act of hostility.
</p>
<p>The First Hostile Act

<p>eight o'clock, say the union miners en-

<p>trusted with keeping any more men from
</p>
<p>reaching the strip mine, additional work-
</p>
<p>men were unloaded from the Chicago
</p>
<p>train at Carbondale, Illinois, about four-
</p>
<p>teen miles from the mine. These men
</p>
<p>were put into a mine truck which was fol-
</p>
<p>lowed by a mine automobile. There were
</p>
<p>eleven men in the two machines. At a
</p>
<p>12
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>tjoint three miles east of Carbondale, men
</p>
<p>in a strange automobile preceding the
</p>
<p>truck fired shots into the air, as if by pre-
</p>
<p>arranged signal. Immediately, shot gun
</p>
<p>firing was directed from underbrush along
</p>
<p>the roadside.
</p>
<p>Some of the eleven strip mine workers
</p>
<p>were wounded seriously and others fled,
</p>
<p>followed by volleys of shot gun firing.
</p>
<p>"Mark" Delaney, who was in charge of
</p>
<p>the strip mine party, made his way back
</p>
<p>to Carbondale and telephoned to Supt.
</p>
<p>McDowell at the mine, relating how these
</p>
<p>two automobile loads of men had been
</p>
<p>fired on and stating that some of them
</p>
<p>had been wounded and taken to the Car-
</p>
<p>bondale hospital.
</p>
<p>Events Known to Officials
</p>
<p>All these events had not escaped the
</p>
<p>ears and eyes of state, city and county
</p>
<p>officials. Col. Hunter, after visiting the
</p>
<p>mine, talking to the Sheriff, State's Attor-
</p>
<p>ney, and other city and county officials in
</p>
<p>Marion and Herrin had concluded as early
</p>
<p>as Monday, June 19th: that "the local
</p>
<p>officers were in sympathy with the bellig-
</p>
<p>erent miners, but had agreed to maintain
</p>
<p>order. ' ' He stated further, ho we ver , that he
</p>
<p>had no confidence in the Sheriff's avowed
</p>
<p>intention or his ability to cope with the sit-
</p>
<p>uation and protect the men . He made this
</p>
<p>report by telephone shortly before noon
</p>
<p>on Monday to the Adjutant-General.
</p>
<p>Hunter told the Adjutant-General that
</p>
<p>the Sheriff had promised to protect prop-

</p>
<p>erty and life at the mines. The Colonel
</p>
<p>advised the Adjutant-General to have
</p>
<p>two companies of the Illinois National
</p>
<p>Guard, one at Salem and one at Cairo,
</p>
<p>notified to be in readiness to entrain for
</p>
<p>Marion on an hour's notice. These two
</p>
<p>companies could have been in Marion
</p>
<p>within four hours.
</p>
<p>13
</p>
<p>The Sheriff's Inaction
</p>
<p>The Adjutant-General told Col. Hunter
</p>
<p>at this time to "lay down" (bear down) on
</p>
<p>the Sheriff and have him do his full duty
</p>
<p>in the way of securing an extra force of
</p>
<p>deputies. That afternoon the Colonel
</p>
<p>asked the Sheriff what he was doing to get
</p>
<p>more deputies and also informed him that
</p>
<p>the two companies of troops were ready
</p>
<p>to respond to any request the Sheriff
</p>
<p>would make. The Sheriff said that he
</p>
<p>felt his regular force of deputies was suffi-
</p>
<p>cient for the present, and that for Col.
</p>
<p>Hunter to tell the Adjutant-General,
</p>
<p>"Troops would not be needed to put down
</p>
<p>trouble at the mines."
</p>
<p>Later in the evening Col. Hunter re-
</p>
<p>ported to the Adjutant-General that the
</p>
<p>Sheriff had not sworn in more deputies
</p>
<p>and did not anticipate the use of troops.
</p>
<p>Col. Hunter got after the Sheriff again on
</p>
<p>Tuesday morning in regard to securing
</p>
<p>additional deputies. The Sheriff replied
</p>
<p>that the wild talk was dying down, and
</p>
<p>Col. Hunter asked him if this was not a
</p>
<p>result of the wide-spread rumor that two
</p>
<p>regiments of troops were headed for
</p>
<p>Marion. The Colonel declared that this
</p>
<p>report was out and did have a noticeably
</p>
<p>quieting effect on the streets until night-
</p>
<p>fall when there was a resurge of excite-
</p>
<p>ment, and anger attained new heights.
</p>
<p>The Colonel talked to miners on the
</p>
<p>street, found they were at the breaking
</p>
<p>point and went again to consult with the

<p>Sheriff. He reports that he "demanded
</p>
<p>of the Sheriff that he swear in a large
</p>
<p>force of deputies, including business men"
</p>
<p>and was informed by the Sheriff that he
</p>
<p>"had the situation well in hand," to which
</p>
<p>Col. Hunter replied:
</p>
<p>"Swear in deputies or ask for troops."
</p>
<p>Wednesday morning, the day before the
</p>
<p>massacre, found events moving swiftly
</p>
<p>14
</p>
<p>toward inevitable disaster. State Senator
</p>
<p>Sneed, who had gone to Springfield on
</p>
<p>official business on Tuesday evening, was
</p>
<p>not available to advise with the Sheriff
</p>
<p>the next morning. When Col. Hunter
</p>
<p>stepped out on the street early on June 21
</p>
<p>and found the whole countryside was liter-
</p>
<p>ally boiling with excitement he imme-
</p>
<p>diately went to the Sheriff's office to see if
</p>
<p>that official had not finally been stirred
</p>
<p>into action, since it was absolutely clear
</p>
<p>that a mob of unprecedented size was be-
</p>
<p>ing gathered to wreak vengeance.
</p>
<p>Calling of Troops Urged
</p>
<p>Col. Hunter found the Sheriff quite
</p>
<p>placid, with no new deputies and uttering
</p>
<p>his stereotyped expression: "I have the
</p>
<p>situation well in hand." Col. Hunter
</p>
<p>grew emphatic in urging the Sheriff to
</p>
<p>make a request for troops . This was done
</p>
<p>in the presence of State's Attorney Duty.
</p>
<p>The Sheriff said that he had no idea of
</p>
<p>calling for troops and Duty offered the
</p>
<p>Sheriff the advice that, ""If I were a Sheriff
</p>
<p>I would not call for troops under any
</p>
<p>circumstances." To Col. Hunter, Duty
</p>
<p>said that he had full confidence in Sheriff
</p>
<p>Thaxton. Col. Hunter hurried away
</p>
<p>from the Sheriff's office, resolved to lay his
</p>
<p>case before the business men of Marion.
</p>
<p>He got C. R. Edrington, secretary of the
</p>
<p>Greater Marion Association, and informed
</p>
<p>the latter that the Sheriff had absolutely
</p>
<p>balked at swearing in deputies or making
</p>
<p>a request for troops.

</p>
<p>The Colonel and Edrington agreed that
</p>
<p>something ought to be done immediately.
</p>
<p>They decided that the best move would
</p>
<p>be to get a committee of reputable busi-
</p>
<p>ness men, mine owners and union miners
</p>
<p>to visit the strip mine and ask the men
</p>
<p>there to suspend operations. By tele-
</p>
<p>phone they summoned A. B. McLaren, a
</p>
<p>15
</p>
<p>wealthy and influential business man of
</p>
<p>Marion; Ralph Mitchell, General Super-
</p>
<p>intendent of the Earnest Coal Company
</p>
<p>and W. II . Rix, a union mine worker offi-
</p>
<p>cial. This conference had hardly assem-
</p>
<p>bled before the news was flashed about the
</p>
<p>attack on the strip mine truck near Car-
</p>
<p>bondale. The five men at the conference
</p>
<p>decided to do all they could to have a
</p>
<p>larger meeting of business men in the
</p>
<p>evening.
</p>
<p>Edrington continued for some hours to
</p>
<p>telephone to responsible people asking
</p>
<p>them to attend the contemplated evening
</p>
<p>conference. Between messages he re-
</p>
<p>ceived reports that armed men were com-
</p>
<p>ing into the Herrin district from far away
</p>
<p>points. The business men in touch with
</p>
<p>Edrington told him that they had this same
</p>
<p>information. Edrington and Hunter again
</p>
<p>tried to locate Sheriff Thaxton to apprise
</p>
<p>him of what the business men's committee
</p>
<p>was attempting to accomplish, and to tell
</p>
<p>him that a concerted assault on the strip
</p>
<p>mine was in prospect, but the Sheriff had
</p>
<p>gone, it was said, to investigate the shoot-
</p>
<p>ing at Carbondale.
</p>
<p>Raids on Stores Begun
</p>
<p>Beginning about one o'clock and con-
</p>
<p>tinuing for a couple of hours telephone
</p>
<p>messages were received at the offices of
</p>
<p>the Greater Marion Association relating
</p>
<p>how hardware stores had been raided in
</p>
<p>Herrin for guns and ammunition.
</p>
<p>Alarm was immediately spread in

<p>Marion advising merchants dealing in fire-
</p>
<p>arms to conceal their stock . Two places in
</p>
<p>Marion did not get this warning and were
</p>
<p>raided. One small band of would-be
</p>
<p>looters, called upon Edrington as head
</p>
<p>of the local American Legion Post, to
</p>
<p>deliver to them several rifles belonging
</p>
<p>to members of the Post. Edrington re-
</p>
<p>16
</p>
<p>fused, explaining that there was no am-
</p>
<p>munition available for the guns.
</p>
<p>The Afternoon Battle
</p>
<p>On Wednesday at 1:37 p. m. Col. Hun-
</p>
<p>ter telephoned to Adjutant-General Black
</p>
<p>reporting the attack on the truck and the
</p>
<p>looting of three stores in Herrin. Col.
</p>
<p>Hunter also told the Sheriff's office about
</p>
<p>the stores being looted and was informed
</p>
<p>by a deputy sheriff that this was the
</p>
<p>office's first word of the occurrence.
</p>
<p>In the meantime the organized armed
</p>
<p>force of union miners, following the
</p>
<p>meeting in the cemetery near Herrin,
</p>
<p>had moved a couple of miles east and
</p>
<p>was ready to launch the attack on
</p>
<p>the strip mine. Attackers deployed over
</p>
<p>a front several hundred yards long and
</p>
<p>put the mine under heavy fire at about
</p>
<p>3:00 o'clock. At 3:15 Supt. McDowell
</p>
<p>called the Greater Marion Association's
</p>
<p>office and informed Col. Hunter that a
</p>
<p>battle was on in full swing and that five
</p>
<p>hundred shots had been fired by both
</p>
<p>sides. McDowell said that the miners had
</p>
<p>marched up close to the mine and had
</p>
<p>gone under cover. McDowell requested
</p>
<p>.Col. Hunter to inform the Sheriff of the
</p>
<p>battle. At the Sheriff's office Deputy
</p>
<p>Storm reported the Sheriff still absent.
</p>
<p>"I instructed Storm to call on all avail-
</p>
<p>able deputies and proceed to the mine to
</p>
<p>disperse the mob and to remain there un-
</p>
<p>til the Sheriff returned," says Col. Hun-
</p>
<p>ter, who added that he asked Storm to

</p>
<p>get the Sheriff by telephone and tell him
</p>
<p>that he ought by all means to put in a
</p>
<p>request for troops. Storm's reply was
</p>
<p>that they "could handle the situation."
</p>
<p>Adjutant-General Black was told of the
</p>
<p>latest situation by telephone and his ad-
</p>
<p>vice to Hunter was to "see that the
</p>
<p>Sheriff gets on the job." Hunter got the
</p>
<p>17
</p>
<p>Sheriff's office on the wire again and was
</p>
<p>informed by whoever answered the tele-
</p>
<p>phone that Deputy Storm was enroute
</p>
<p>with deputies to the mine. That Storm
</p>
<p>or deputies went to the mine is unverified.
</p>
<p>A few minutes later Supt. McDowell
</p>
<p>called from the mine to tell Col. Hunter
</p>
<p>that the mob had gotten bigger and to
</p>
<p>inquire if Sheriff Thaxton had been lo-
</p>
<p>cated. Hunter told McDowell that he
</p>
<p>had been informed by the Sheriff's office
</p>
<p>that the deputies were on the way to the
</p>
<p>mine.
</p>
<p>A Survivor's Story
</p>
<p>Engineman Tracy, in his account of
</p>
<p>how he saw the Wednesday afternoon
</p>
<p>battle start, gives his opinion that the
</p>
<p>shots fired at his locomotive, at that time
</p>
<p>quite a distance from the mine, were the
</p>
<p>opening ones of the attack. Hardly had
</p>
<p>he reached camp before bullets began to
</p>
<p>rain in from a house and from nearby
</p>
<p>clumps of trees and embankments.
</p>
<p>McDowell grabbed a gun and gave Tracy
</p>
<p>one. He mounted a ridge and began
</p>
<p>shooting.
</p>
<p>Under oath, Bernard Jones, a mine
</p>
<p>guard, says he saw union scouts in the
</p>
<p>woods June 20th, and that the following
</p>
<p>afternoon bullets began to whip up the
</p>
<p>earth near him. He and three compan-
</p>
<p>ions mounted an elevation and made the
</p>
<p>attackers retreat to a white farm house
</p>
<p>five hundred yards distant.

<p>tendent John E. Shoemaker, brother-in-
</p>
<p>law to W. J. Lester, telephoned that fire
</p>
<p>from the defenders had struck down at
</p>
<p>least two union miners in the attacking
</p>
<p>party. McDowell took the telephone
</p>
<p>again and inquired if the Sheriff had been
</p>
<p>found and had made a request for troops.
</p>
<p>All Hunter could tell McDowell was that
</p>
<p>he was still trying to locate the Sheriff.
</p>
<p>18
</p>
<p>' At 4:14 p. m., when Col. Hunter got
</p>
<p>McDowell on the wire and found the
</p>
<p>battle was still raging and no sheriff
</p>
<p>and no deputies could be found to inter-
</p>
<p>vene, McDowell put his case in Hunter's
</p>
<p>hands and asked for advice. Imme-
</p>
<p>diately Col. Hunter suggested that a truce
</p>
<p>be effected and outlined terms . McDowell
</p>
<p>agreed and Hunter told him that he would
</p>
<p>act at once.
</p>
<p>The Truce
</p>
<p>While Col. Hunter was trying to locate
</p>
<p>union mine workers' officials relative to
</p>
<p>the truce, he got word from Mr. McLaren
</p>
<p>and C. F. Hamilton, business partner of
</p>
<p>Lester, that they had told Lester that the
</p>
<p>mine was under heavy fire and he said he
</p>
<p>would close it, and that he would try to
</p>
<p>get a telephone message through to
</p>
<p>McDowell to this effect. McDowell's
</p>
<p>agreement to accept a truce was put before
</p>
<p>Fox Hughes, Sub-District Vice-President
</p>
<p>and ranking U. M. W. of A. official on
</p>
<p>the spot. Hunter asked Hughes if he
</p>
<p>thought he could get the attacking party
</p>
<p>to agree to a truce on the terms as out-
</p>
<p>lined to McDowell and Hughes replied
</p>
<p>that he thought this arrangement would
</p>
<p>be agreeable to the union miners who were
</p>
<p>attacking.
</p>
<p>"I told Hughes I would instruct
</p>
<p>McDowell to put up a white flag of truce
</p>
<p>when he saw the union miner officials
</p>
<p>approaching under their white flag of
</p>
<p>truce," Col. Hunters says. The Colonel

</p>
<p>then asserts that Hughes told him
</p>
<p>that he (Hughes) and Hugh Willis and
</p>
<p>William G. Davis (the latter secretary
</p>
<p>and treasurer of the miners' union) 
</p>
<p>these are three of the best known and most
</p>
<p>prominent U. M. W. of A. officials in
</p>
<p>Williamson County  would go to the
</p>
<p>mine under their white flag of truce.
</p>
<p>Hunter immediately advised McDowell
</p>
<p>19
</p>
<p>that the U. M. W. of A. officials ha*'
</p>
<p>agreed to the truce and were headed fci
</p>
<p>the mine. He then got Hughes on the
</p>
<p>wire again and told the latter of what he
</p>
<p>had just telephoned to McDowell. Hugh
</p>
<p>"Willis and Davis soon thereafter appeared
</p>
<p>at the mine under their flag of truce and
</p>
<p>the firing stopped, they later reported to
</p>
<p>Hunter. McDowell telephoned to Hun-
</p>
<p>ter that the flags of truce were flying and
</p>
<p>that gun-fire had ceased.
</p>
<p>A short time later, Hughes and Willis
</p>
<p>reached the office of State's Attorney
</p>
<p>Duty at Marion, and called Hunter
</p>
<p>and his Aide, Major R. W. Davis, to
</p>
<p>Duty's office. Sheriff Thaxton was there.
</p>
<p>"Hughes and Willis announced to the
</p>
<p>meeting that both sides at the mines had
</p>
<p>flags up and there was no firing," says
</p>
<p>Colonel Hunter.
</p>
<p>The White Flag
</p>
<p>Engineman Tracy's version of how the
</p>
<p>truce was established and firing brought
</p>
<p>to an end late Wednesday afternoon is
</p>
<p>substantially as follows: he stayed on the
</p>
<p>elevated point using his rifle until Superin-
</p>
<p>tendent McDowell went up to him and
</p>
<p>said to him, "The Union President is
</p>
<p>there and I am going to have a conference
</p>
<p>to stop the firing." Tracy did cease
</p>
<p>shooting and says that "A. P. Finley,
</p>
<p>the time keeper, got out a white sheet and
</p>
<p>sent it by a man named Jones to Tracy,
</p>
<p>who hung it up on the wires." Tracy esti-
</p>
<p>mates he was shot at about fifty times

</p>
<p>while he was hanging the sheet up, but
</p>
<p>that this firing died away and he crawled
</p>
<p>down and out of danger.
</p>
<p>Tracy makes this peculiar comment,
</p>
<p>"then it developed the miners' president
</p>
<p>had not appeared after all," and he adds
</p>
<p>that there was sniping all through the
</p>
<p>night. He said he could hear the attack-
</p>
<p>20
</p>
<p>ers drilling in the field surrounding the
</p>
<p>mine and that the commands "squads
</p>
<p>right" and "squads left" came clearly to
</p>
<p>his ears.
</p>
<p>The Terms
</p>
<p>At the Wednesday evening meeting in
</p>
<p>State's Attorney Duty's office, where Col.
</p>
<p>Hunter and Maj. Davis went in response
</p>
<p>to a telephone call from Fox Hughes and
</p>
<p>Hugh AVillis, Sheriff Thaxton also being
</p>
<p>present, Col. Hunter says he repeated the
</p>
<p>statement that responsible business men
</p>
<p>of Marion who had talked over long dis-
</p>
<p>tance telephone to the owner of the strip
</p>
<p>mine, had given him (Col. Hunter) posi-
</p>
<p>tive and reliable assurance that the mine
</p>
<p>would be abandoned and closed so long as
</p>
<p>the U. M. W. of A. strike lasted. The
</p>
<p>Colonel asserts that there was a clear
</p>
<p>understanding of all the terms of the
</p>
<p>truce, which both sides had accepted.
</p>
<p>The Colonel says these terms were under-
</p>
<p>stood by everybody at this meeting to be
</p>
<p>as follows:
</p>
<p>(1) Both sides to hoist flags of truce
</p>
<p>and cease firing.
</p>
<p>(2) The men in the strip mine to be
</p>
<p>afforded protection in getting out of the
</p>
<p>County and that the mine property be
</p>
<p>not damaged.
</p>
<p>(3) The mine to be closed ior the
</p>
<p>duration of the U. M. W. of A. strike.
</p>
<p>Hughes and Willis left the conference.
</p>
<p>Turning to Sheriff Thaxton, Col. Hunter
</p>
<p>asked him point blank if he felt sure

</p>
<p>he could hold up his end of the truce
</p>
<p>agreement and the Sheriff then stated that
</p>
<p>he had "deputies at the mine who could
</p>
<p>handle the situation, and that he felt cer-
</p>
<p>tain the truce would be observed and the
</p>
<p>trouble ended."
</p>
<p>21
</p>
<p>Refuse to Call Troops
</p>
<p>Despite this assurance given by the
</p>
<p>Sheriff, Col. Hunter was uneasy during
</p>
<p>the evening. He found that the tele-
</p>
<p>phone wires at the mine had been cut
</p>
<p>and dynamite blasts were heard from
</p>
<p>the direction of the mine. He urged the
</p>
<p>Sheriff, as a matter of protecting the pris-
</p>
<p>oners on march from the mine in the morn-
</p>
<p>ing, to make an official request for troops.
</p>
<p>The Sheriff refused. Col. Hunter then
</p>
<p>asked the Sheriff to go to the mine with
</p>
<p>him and personally see to it that the truce
</p>
<p>was lived up to. The Sheriff also declined
</p>
<p>to do this, saying he was tired and was
</p>
<p>going home and to bed. This was near-
</p>
<p>ing 11:00 o'clock.
</p>
<p>During the conference, when the U. M.
</p>
<p>W. of A. officials were present, an agree-
</p>
<p>ment was reached that all of those then
</p>
<p>in the room should go to the mine in the
</p>
<p>morning. Col . Hunter suggested that the
</p>
<p>hour of departure be at 5 or 6 o'clock.
</p>
<p>Sheriff Thaxton, however, set 8 a. m. as
</p>
<p>the hour for leaving.
</p>
<p>At 6:00 o'clock the next morning and
</p>
<p>again at 8:00 a. m., Col. Hunter and
</p>
<p>Major Davis were at the door of the Sher-
</p>
<p>iff's office and found it locked. It' was
</p>
<p>8:30 o'clock before they encountered the
</p>
<p>Sheriff leisurely walking on the public
</p>
<p>square. Hughes and Willis, the U. M.
</p>
<p>W. of A. officials who had promised to be
</p>
<p>members of the Sheriff's party, were not
</p>
<p>to be found. Col. Hunter, Major Davis,

</p>
<p>the Sheriff and one of the deputies, Shef-
</p>
<p>fer, started by automobile for the mine.
</p>
<p>They arrived there at about the hour
</p>
<p>when the massacre was taking place in
</p>
<p>the woods two miles distant . They found
</p>
<p>the mine swarming with men engaged in
</p>
<p>pillage and arson and who continued the
</p>
<p>destruction of property under the very eyes
</p>
<p>of the officers and defied interruption.
</p>
<p>22
</p>
<p>The Surrender
</p>
<p>It had been Col. Hunter's original
</p>
<p>thought that if a truce could be effected
</p>
<p>quickly enough, that the men in the mine
</p>
<p>should vacate before night fall, but it was
</p>
<p>around 6:30 o'clock before the flags were
</p>
<p>hoisted and the firing ceased. No arrange-
</p>
<p>ment, however, were made to afford safe
</p>
<p>escort to the men that evening.
</p>
<p>Some of the prisoners who survived
</p>
<p>the next day's massacre, say that there
</p>
<p>was sporadic shooting during hours of
</p>
<p>darkness when the attacking miners
</p>
<p>swarmed into the big gulches dug by the
</p>
<p>steam shovels and drew a tight circle
</p>
<p>around the bunk cars and coal cars where
</p>
<p>the strip mine workers spent the night.
</p>
<p>At least five big charges of dynamite
</p>
<p>were exploded against mine machinery
</p>
<p>and property. One blast was set off
</p>
<p>within thirty feet of the bunk cars where
</p>
<p>the strip miners were housed.
</p>
<p>Tracy's description of the surrender
</p>
<p>Thursday morning is one of the most con-
</p>
<p>nected that has been given. He relates
</p>
<p>that instructions were given to the men
</p>
<p>in the mine not to fire any more but that
</p>
<p>some one should be sent out from the strip
</p>
<p>mine party with a truce flag. Tracy over-
</p>
<p>heard McDowell tell his assistant, John
</p>
<p>E. Shoemaker, a civil engineer, son of the
</p>
<p>Mayor of Charleston, Illinois, that there
</p>
<p>should be no shooting and the truce flag
</p>
<p>should be carried out.
</p>
<p>A big fellow, known as "Mac," had not

</p>
<p>stepped out over 20 yards from the cars
</p>
<p>when he was fired on and he ran back,
</p>
<p>says Tracy, who continues:
</p>
<p>"Either Mac or Jones then marched
</p>
<p>out with a cook's apron tied to a broom.
</p>
<p>I heard several of the attackers then say
</p>
<p>that if we would march out and lay down
</p>
<p>our arms they would not harm us. They
</p>
<p>23
</p>
<p>shouted they would take us on a train
</p>
<p>and let us go back home."
</p>
<p>Prisoners Throw Up Hands
</p>
<p>Tracy says that all rifles were laid down
</p>
<p>and shells put between cars and that all
</p>
<p>the prisoners put their hands over their
</p>
<p>heads and walked out into the open.
</p>
<p>This was in accordance with instructions
</p>
<p>given by the attacking miners and repeat-
</p>
<p>ed by McDowell and Shoemaker, as an
</p>
<p>order to the strip miners, Tracy avers.
</p>
<p>The attackers came hurrying up from all
</p>
<p>directions, some of them firing their guns.
</p>
<p>They yelled in exultation.
</p>
<p>"A man who acted like a leader shouted
</p>
<p>at them to quit firing at us," Tracy goes
</p>
<p>on. "He was a little heavy set fellow
</p>
<p>about forty or forty -five years old , weighed
</p>
<p>about 170 pounds, dark complected
</p>
<p>and dressed in a dark suit. He waved a
</p>
<p>big automatic pistol and yelled 'Now you
</p>
<p>ought to use judgment, there is no use
</p>
<p>getting excited or starting any trouble
</p>
<p>whatever. I am a leader of this bunch.
</p>
<p>Listen to me and we will take them down
</p>
<p>the road.'
</p>
<p>"A mob yelled him down and some of
</p>
<p>them told him if he didn't shut up they
</p>
<p>would shoot him. They said they were
</p>
<p>going to kill the whole bunch."
</p>
<p>The march smacked very much of mili-
</p>
<p>tary discipline, and although there were at
</p>
<p>least 3,000 men mostly armed in the crowd
</p>
<p>around the prisoners, those in charge
</p>
<p>were able to secure obedience to their

<p>orders.
</p>
<p>Tracy describes how ill treatment of the
</p>
<p>prisoners was kept up as they marched
</p>
<p>along but the violence was not desperate
</p>
<p>except in the case of McDowell. He was
</p>
<p>made an immediate target for blows
</p>
<p>which were not long in bringing about
</p>
<p>his death.
</p>
<p>24
</p>
<p>Jones's Story
</p>
<p>Another account of the surrender and
</p>
<p>start of the march from the mine is given
</p>
<p>under oath by Bernard Jones, the mine
</p>
<p>guard who was quoted above . Jones says
</p>
<p>of the Thursday morning events:
</p>
<p>"The white sheet (the flag of truce on
</p>
<p>the wires) was taken down because the
</p>
<p>mob yelled 'Take that damned flag down.'
</p>
<p>We knew there would be a battle."
</p>
<p>The prisoners felt they were in a trap
</p>
<p>and some of them were panic stricken,
</p>
<p>Jones asserts. McDowell said "Some-
</p>
<p>body ought to go talk to the attackers."
</p>
<p>Jones says that he went out with an apron
</p>
<p>tied to a broom and told the victors that
</p>
<p>the strip mine workers were ready to sur-
</p>
<p>render provided they were given the assur-
</p>
<p>ance of being allowed to walk out unmo-
</p>
<p>lested. Jones says he called out, "I want
</p>
<p>to talk to you" and that a leader answered.
</p>
<p>Jones describes this leader as being 24 or
</p>
<p>25 years old, weight 160, 5 feet 9, with
</p>
<p>sharp, freckled face, light haired and tot-
</p>
<p>ing a rifle. This leader, Jones asserts,
</p>
<p>agreed to the proposition of letting them
</p>
<p>out unmolested provided "you come out
</p>
<p>unarmed, with your hands up in the air."
</p>
<p>McDowell overheard this promise, says
</p>
<p>Jones, with the result that "we were all
</p>
<p>formed in line, hands up, and walked west
</p>
<p>on the railroad tracks 150 yards to where
</p>
<p>the union men were congregated. The
</p>
<p>prisoners were covered with rifles and
</p>
<p>pistols by their captors who rushed up

</p>
<p>close and searched them for weapons."
</p>
<p>Jones estimated that there were 3,000
</p>
<p>armed men in the crowd to which they sur-
</p>
<p>rendered. He said the victors began slap-
</p>
<p>ping the prisoners who were marched two
</p>
<p>abreast down the railway tracks. About
</p>
<p>200 yards had been covered when the
</p>
<p>prisoners were told to take their hands
</p>
<p>down and their hats off. McDowell was
</p>
<p>25
</p>
<p>struck and kicked. When the prisoners
</p>
<p>were forced to go on a trot McDowell
</p>
<p>was unable to keep up because of his peg
</p>
<p>leg and he fell two or three times. The
</p>
<p>treatment of McDowell soon became so
</p>
<p>brutal that he could go no further.
</p>
<p>The Murder of McDowell
</p>
<p>Tracy describes the killing of McDowell
</p>
<p>in more detail. The procession had got-
</p>
<p>ten to a place called Crenshaw Crossing
</p>
<p>and the prisoners were being beaten pretty-
</p>
<p>generally when a new leader appeared,
</p>
<p>and was hailed as "Tom" or "Bill."
</p>
<p>Tracy describes him thus: "A big fellow,
</p>
<p>50, stout, weight 190, 5 feet 10, with a
</p>
<p>week's growth of beard, rawboned, dress-
</p>
<p>ed roughly, wearing blue overalls and felt
</p>
<p>hat." This leader singled out McDowell
</p>
<p>and said to the latter that he had put
</p>
<p>Howat in jail in Kansas but would never
</p>
<p>put anybody else in jail.
</p>
<p>This leader began beating McDowell
</p>
<p>over the head with a .45 caliber automatic
</p>
<p>pistol and kept it up for about 200 yards
</p>
<p>when he took McDowell out of line and
</p>
<p>knocked him down with a heavy blow on
</p>
<p>the side of the head. Tracy said he saw
</p>
<p>some six or eight women, some of them
</p>
<p>carrying babies in their arms, kick
</p>
<p>McDowell. Tracy did not see this par-
</p>
<p>ticular leader any more. The captives
</p>
<p>were nearing the place where the ghastly
</p>
<p>job was to be done and the leaders, se-
</p>
<p>lected for this work, began to spread their
</p>
<p>instructions to the armed strikers, as the

</p>
<p>following versions of survivors show :
</p>
<p>Halt to the march was .called, says
</p>
<p>Jones, by "a gray haired man, weight 190
</p>
<p>to 195, aged 45 or 50, so gray he was
</p>
<p>white, stubby mustache, in overalls, wav-
</p>
<p>ing a .45 caliber Colt who shouted: T
</p>
<p>want to shoot all the * * * ' "
</p>
<p>Jones says the reply made to this gray
</p>
<p>26
</p>
<p>'
</p>
<p>haired man was "We will take care of
</p>
<p>them when we get to Herrin." The
</p>
<p>march was continued about a quarter of
</p>
<p>a mile further up the road when another
</p>
<p>fellow stepped in and made a speech,
</p>
<p>Jones says, about what should be done
</p>
<p>"to us on account of his beloved union
</p>
<p>brothers being bumped off the day before
</p>
<p>or being killed." Under oath Jones de-
</p>
<p>clares: "The speaker said 'Boys I will
</p>
<p>show you what to do with them.' "
</p>
<p>This speaker is described by Jones as
</p>
<p>5 feet 9 or 10 inches, weight 190, dark
</p>
<p>hair, dark complexion, dressed in dark
</p>
<p>clothes and carrying a revolver. One
</p>
<p>young fellow in the crowd shouted to
</p>
<p>the speaker "Listen, buddy, don't rush
</p>
<p>things, don't go too fast."
</p>
<p>To this the new leader replied: "To
</p>
<p>Hell . You don't know nothing , you have
</p>
<p>been here only a day or so, I have been here
</p>
<p>for years, I have lost my sleep 4 or 5
</p>
<p>nights watching those scabs and I am go-
</p>
<p>ing to see them taken care of."
</p>
<p>But the march was continued until the
</p>
<p>procession drew very close to the power
</p>
<p>plant where a halt again was called. Jones
</p>
<p>describes how, at this point there came
</p>
<p>up from the rear a "heavy built man, dark
</p>
<p>complexion, dark haired, wearing a Fe-
</p>
<p>dora hat," who talked to the miners at
</p>
<p>the head of the line and asked who had
</p>
<p>operated the machine gun. This ques-
</p>
<p>tion was put to the prisoners, who said

</p>
<p>they didn't know.
</p>
<p>Tracy remarks that it was at this point
</p>
<p>a man "who all the strip miners said was
</p>
<p>an officer of the Miners' Local appeared
</p>
<p>in an automobile, drew the mob leader
</p>
<p>aside and after talking to him pointed to
</p>
<p>the woods."
</p>
<p>The Massacre
</p>
<p>Tracy says this man in the automobile
</p>
<p>then drove away while the leader led the
</p>
<p>27
</p>
<p>column into the woods and commanded
</p>
<p>that "every fellow that has got a rifle
</p>
<p>come forward; you fellows that ain't got
</p>
<p>no rifles stay back." Tracy estimated
</p>
<p>that about 500 men, carrying pistols,
</p>
<p>rifles, shot guns, and all kinds of weapons
</p>
<p>followed the prisoners into the woods.
</p>
<p>The leader lined the strip miners up at a
</p>
<p>barbed wire fence and shouted "when I
</p>
<p>give the command every fellow fire."
</p>
<p>At this order there was a rush among
</p>
<p>the armed men to get close up in front.
</p>
<p>Tracy says he could "hear the guns cock
</p>
<p>as they pulled up." Then came the order
</p>
<p>to run. Tracy ducked under the fence
</p>
<p>and fled at top speed, turning only to look
</p>
<p>back and see men fall while their pursuers
</p>
<p>reloaded and shot into them again.
</p>
<p>Jones remembers someone saying, just
</p>
<p>before the massacre took place :
</p>
<p>"Listen men, I want to talk to you.
</p>
<p>We can't take these men to Herrin but it
</p>
<p>will be all right to take them out into the
</p>
<p>woods and field and start them on the
</p>
<p>run and then all of you can get a shot at
</p>
<p>them."
</p>
<p>This plan prevailed. After a while,
</p>
<p>Jones says, the order to fire came froni the
</p>
<p>"leader and the rest of them, all of them."
</p>
<p>Jones heard them shout "come on you and
</p>
<p>start to run for that fence and field."
</p>
<p>It is Jones' opinion that several shots
</p>
<p>were fired before anybody started to run.

<p>seated in an automobile pulled up at
</p>
<p>the edge of a road, saw the cavalcade pass.
</p>
<p>They wrote as follows: "The advanced
</p>
<p>guard rattling by in scores of flivvers had
</p>
<p>screeched the news 'We got 'em. They're
</p>
<p>28
</p>
<p>ii
</p>
<p>coming.* And they came, the limping
</p>
<p>mine superintendent blinking and trying
</p>
<p>to ward off further blows." Others were
</p>
<p>about as much battered.
</p>
<p>A semi-official account of what hap-
</p>
<p>pened after the prisoners had passed a
</p>
<p>point where the two newspaper men saw
</p>
<p>them is as follows:
</p>
<p>The Slaughter at the Fence
</p>
<p>The first desperate violence to the prison-
</p>
<p>ers came after fresh bands of men from
</p>
<p>Zeigler and other points had joined the
</p>
<p>mob marching the prisoners toward Her-
</p>
<p>rin.
</p>
<p>Approaching the power plant, a young
</p>
<p>chap, about five feet seven tall, to whom
</p>
<p>recognition was given as leader, halted the
</p>
<p>prisoners and their escorts. He gave
</p>
<p>orders for the column to move to the right
</p>
<p>which would take the prisoners off the
</p>
<p>road and put them into the woods back
</p>
<p>of the power house.
</p>
<p>At a point immediately in the rear of
</p>
<p>the power house and not more than 250
</p>
<p>feet distant from it, the prisoners were
</p>
<p>halted about twenty feet from a four-
</p>
<p>strand barbed wire fence . The prisoners,
</p>
<p>46 or 47 of them , were lined up as targets.
</p>
<p>The 500 armed men were arranged in
</p>
<p>two squads, forming a shallow "V or
</p>
<p>semi-circle. This boxed the prisoners in
</p>
<p>and gave them no opportunity to get
</p>
<p>away from the gun-fire except through the
</p>
<p>barbed wire. The command was given,

</p>
<p>and the dead and wounded began to drop
</p>
<p>and a "rabbit" hunt with men as the
</p>
<p>game ensued. Many who got through
</p>
<p>the wire were killed and others wounded.
</p>
<p>Some of the wounded were mutilated after
</p>
<p>29
</p>
<p>they had been brought down to earth by
</p>
<p>bullets.
</p>
<p>Reporter Sees Mutilated Victims
</p>
<p>The first newspaper man to arrive on
</p>
<p>the scene, in the woods, J. E. Hendricks,
</p>
<p>of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch had been
</p>
<p>held up an hour in Herrin by a crowd
</p>
<p>which had told him that what was going
</p>
<p>on was the town's own business and was
</p>
<p>nothing for the newspapers. Finally he
</p>
<p>got free enough to follow a crowd stream-
</p>
<p>ing from Herrin to a woods on the edge of
</p>
<p>town. Arriving at the scene of the
</p>
<p>massacre, he saw several of the prisoners
</p>
<p>with throats cut and one man hanging
</p>
<p>to a tree. At another point where it ap-
</p>
<p>peared at least six men had been taken
</p>
<p>into a cemetery, and three killed and three
</p>
<p>wounded, their clothing showed they had
</p>
<p>been dragged over the ground, after hav-
</p>
<p>ing been tied with rope. In the far dis-
</p>
<p>tance men could be seen running, pursued
</p>
<p>by little groups of other men, much as
</p>
<p>rabbits running from hounds.
</p>
<p>Another account, given by a man who
</p>
<p>went unarmed with the mob, says:
</p>
<p>"I saw one man shot with a shot gun
</p>
<p>which tore a hole in him where you could
</p>
<p>see his heart and it was shot half in two.
</p>
<p>One fellow begged me to help him. I
</p>
<p>told him if I saw anyone looking for him
</p>
<p>I wouldn't show them where he was, but
</p>
<p>that was all I could do for him. He just
</p>
<p>begged me not to shoot him. He said
</p>
<p>the other man told five of them that they

</p>
<p>would turn them loose if they could run
</p>
<p>through fire and they said they would.
</p>
<p>The other four were killed and he was
</p>
<p>shot twice, but not bad."

<p>Stories of Slaughter
</p>
<p>The Associated Press correspondent
</p>
<p>whose accounts of the massacre atrocities
</p>
<p>made the nation shudder with horror and
</p>
<p>caused Congressman Dennison to attempt
</p>
<p>denial on the floor of the House, under-
</p>
<p>went gun-fire and more than once risked
</p>
<p>his life to witness the concluding phases
</p>
<p>of the massacre. This man is a veteran
</p>
<p>reporter from the Chicago office of the
</p>
<p>Associated Press.
</p>
<p>Arriving in Marion at 8 o'clock on the
</p>
<p>morning of the butchery he was rushed by
</p>
<p>automobile to the mine where he saw Col.
</p>
<p>Hunter and others making futile effort to
</p>
<p>check the work of the firebugs and looters.
</p>
<p>He was told that the strip miners had
</p>
<p>surrendered and hearing gunfire coming
</p>
<p>from the direction they had taken, he
</p>
<p>jumped back in his auto and went in pur-
</p>
<p>suit of the marchers. This was just about
</p>
<p>the moment when the shooting at the
</p>
<p>barbed wire was taking place.
</p>
<p>Some ten minutes drive from the mine,
</p>
<p>the hired chauffeur refused to go further
</p>
<p>because a crowd of armed men could be
</p>
<p>seen on a knoll near the road. The
</p>
<p>A. P. man proceeded on foot. He found
</p>
<p>several jeering six of the victims, three
</p>
<p>of whom yet exhibited signs of life. All
</p>
<p>had ropes around their necks. He heard
</p>
<p>one of the wounded men beg piteously for
</p>
<p>a drink of water. At this, he hurried to
</p>
<p>a house 100 yards distant, picked up a
</p>
<p>small pail partly filled with water and

</p>
<p>ran back toward the spot.
</p>
<p>He was stopped by a large man of the
</p>
<p>mountaineer type who pulled a pistol
</p>
<p>from his holster and commanded "keep
</p>
<p>back there, don't come around these fel-
</p>
<p>lows." Others in the crowd drew pistols
</p>
<p>and menaced him. The leader was of
</p>
<p>distinctive appearance, weight about 200,
</p>
<p>I age about 45, height six feet two, raw-
</p>
<p>31
</p>
<p>H
</p>
<p>boned, much sunburned, light hair, a
</p>
<p>clearly American type. He wore faded
</p>
<p>blue overalls and shirt and spoke slowly,
</p>
<p>but without a Southern drawl. The brim
</p>
<p>of his black slouch hat was covered with
</p>
<p>dust, as though he had been with the
</p>
<p>marchers from the start.
</p>
<p>Two of the three wounded men con-
</p>
<p>tinued to plead for water. "Give me a
</p>
<p>drink before I die," said one of them.
</p>
<p>At this a comely woman of 24 years ap-
</p>
<p>parelled neatly in a light flowered cloth
</p>
<p>dress and carrying an infant of a year in
</p>
<p>her arms, put her foot on the body of the
</p>
<p>suppliant and exclaimed: "I'll see you in
</p>
<p>hell before you get any water."
</p>
<p>The Man Hunt
</p>
<p>The Associated Press correspondent
</p>
<p>was then ordered to "move along." As
</p>
<p>he neared the woodland massacre scene
</p>
<p>he saw three men jump from hiding places
</p>
<p>about 100 yards distant and run for their
</p>
<p>lives. Some 200 yards from the running
</p>
<p>men there appeared a group of pursuers
</p>
<p>who fired as they leaped forward. Ten
</p>
<p>seconds later another band began shoot-
</p>
<p>ing at the fleeing prisoners. The Asso-
</p>
<p>ciated Press man was caught in a cross
</p>
<p>fire with bullets whizzing past him from
</p>
<p>two points. As he raced for safety he
</p>
<p>turned to see one of the three prisoners
</p>
<p>fall . "What happened further to the fallen
</p>
<p>man or his companions the Associated
</p>
<p>Press man could not see.
</p>

</p>
<p>butchery had reached its height, the
</p>
<p>'Associated Press correspondent came up-
</p>
<p>on a man strung up to the stub of a broken
</p>
<p>tree limb. Lying on the ground a few
</p>
<p>feet distant were two other men, each
</p>
<p>with a rope around his neck. It did not
</p>
<p>appear they had been hanged but both
</p>
<p>were dead of bullet wounds.
</p>
<p>32
</p>
<p>\
</p>
<p>The woods were swarming with men
</p>
<p>armed with pistols and shot guns. Two
</p>
<p>men carried sawed off riot guns. The
</p>
<p>Associated Press correspondent, at a
</p>
<p>point about 100 yards distant from the
</p>
<p>hanged man, stopped beside a wounded
</p>
<p>man who was writhing in agony and ask-
</p>
<p>ing for a drink: "I wish I was dead" he
</p>
<p>muttered. A half dozen times he said
</p>
<p>this.
</p>
<p>Pleas for Mercy Bring Kicks
</p>
<p>Instead of exciting pity, the man's dy-
</p>
<p>ing words seemed to make the men stand-
</p>
<p>ing around him angrier than before. They
</p>
<p>cursed and kicked him. Apparently irri-
</p>
<p>tated beyond control, a man of foreign
</p>
<p>type, stockily built, about five feet seven
</p>
<p>in height, with high cheek bones, a long
</p>
<p>flowing mustache and chin that came to a
</p>
<p>sharp point opened a pocket knife and
</p>
<p>with the exclamation, "I'll make you
</p>
<p>dead" plunged the blade into the helpless
</p>
<p>prisoner's throat.
</p>
<p>Although it was thought for a time that
</p>
<p>six of the prisoners had been cut out of
</p>
<p>line and tied together and then shot down
</p>
<p>before the procession reached the power
</p>
<p>house woods, the best account of this
</p>
<p>incident now has it that the six were
</p>
<p>stragglers who had gotten through the
</p>
<p>barb wire and were rounded up, roped
</p>
<p>together and marched through the Herrin
</p>
<p>Cemetery, then marched back out of
</p>
<p>Herrin and told to run. Gun fire brought

</p>
<p>one of them down, and he pulled the
</p>
<p>others off their feet. Their pursuers then
</p>
<p>rushed up close and fired into them at a
</p>
<p>distance of four or five feet.
</p>
<p>One of these men, Howard Hoffman, of
</p>
<p>Huntington, Indiana, lived long enough
</p>
<p>to reach the hospital where he is credited
</p>
<p>with telling Doctor Black and the nurse
</p>
<p>that his throat was cut and men jumped on
</p>
<p>him after he was down. Another one of
</p>
<p>33
</p>
<p>these men told the doctor or nurse at the
</p>
<p>Herrin Hospital how, after he had fallen,
</p>
<p>one of the men stretched his head back as
</p>
<p>far as possible so that another might easily-
</p>
<p>cut his throat. This man died without
</p>
<p>his name being learned and he was buried
</p>
<p>with the other unidentified dead in the
</p>
<p>Potters Field at Herrin.
</p>
<p>At the Morgue
</p>
<p>On the street in front of the morgue in
</p>
<p>Herrin, the following day, the Associated
</p>
<p>Press man, encountered the mountaineer-
</p>
<p>like man who had held him back from giv-
</p>
<p>ing a drink to the wounded man on the
</p>
<p>knoll. Asked when the inquest would be
</p>
<p>held, the big man replied: "There don't
</p>
<p>need to be any inquest, everybody knows
</p>
<p>they're dead." The dead were first piled
</p>
<p>in a heap in a corner in the morgue.
</p>
<p>Later the clothing was removed from all
</p>
<p>the bodies and they were laid in a row
</p>
<p>and thus exposed wholly to view. Lines
</p>
<p>of men, women, boys and girls filed
</p>
<p>through the morgue and joked at the
</p>
<p>sight. Later some portions of the bodies
</p>
<p>were covered. Here and there was a
</p>
<p>body so filled with small shot that scarce
</p>
<p>a half inch square surface of the skin had
</p>
<p>escaped.
</p>
<p>The visitors did not hesitate to gloat
</p>
<p>over the "fine" work the mob had done.
</p>
<p>One woman leading a little boy, exclaimed
</p>
<p>as she directed his attention to the lifeless
</p>
<p>bodies: "Take a look at what your papa
</p>
<p>did, kid."

<p>Edward Miller, 1545 North Clark St.,
</p>
<p>Chicago, told a St. Louis Post-Dispatch
</p>
<p>reporter that he and another of the strip
</p>
<p>mine men escaped wounded into a barn
</p>
<p>where they were located by man hunters
</p>
<p>who fired bullets into both of them, kill-
</p>
<p>ing Miller's companion.
</p>
<p>Robert McLennon, Jr., of 5%5 N. La
</p>
<p>34
</p>
<p>q
</p>
<p>Salle St., Chicago, told the same reporter
</p>
<p>that the cool-headed miners who were
</p>
<p>escorting the prisoners were outnumbered
</p>
<p>from the start by miners who wanted to
</p>
<p>kill. The leaders counseled against vio-
</p>
<p>lence until the woods were reached, said
</p>
<p>McLennon .
</p>
<p>Fred Bernard of Chicago, escaped by-
</p>
<p>turning left when, as he says, the leader
</p>
<p>of the mob gave the command to "turn
</p>
<p>right." He was fired upon and fell un-
</p>
<p>hurt. Pursuers ran up to him. He told
</p>
<p>them he had a union card in his pocket.
</p>
<p>He finally proved he was an Elk and was
</p>
<p>given assistance in escaping.
</p>
<p>Sherman Holman, one of the wounded
</p>
<p>survivors, declares he fell wounded along
</p>
<p>side Assistant Superintendent John E.
</p>
<p>Shoemaker and describes how pursuers
</p>
<p>came up and remarked "the * * * is
</p>
<p>still breathing, anybody got a shell?"
</p>
<p>and that Shoemaker was then shot
</p>
<p>through the head.
</p>
<p>The Coroner's Jury
</p>
<p>At the inquest held by Coroner McCown
</p>
<p>in Herrin on Sunday, June 25th, over the
</p>
<p>bodies of 21 victims of the massacre, no
</p>
<p>effort was made to establish the identity
</p>
<p>of any of the men who killed the unarmed
</p>
<p>prisoners. "Parties unknown" did the
</p>
<p>killing according to the verdict.
</p>
<p>The Verdict
</p>
<p>About twenty -five witnesses were exam-
</p>
<p>ined by the jury and the following verdict

</p>
<p>was returned:
</p>
<p>"In the matter of inquisition over the
</p>
<p>bodies of deceased held at Herrin, Illi-
</p>
<p>nois, on the 25th day of June A. D.
</p>
<p>1922, we, the undersigned jurors, find
</p>
<p>that they came to their deaths by gun
</p>
<p>shot wounds by the hands of parties
</p>
<p>35
</p>
<p>unknown on the 22nd day of June A. D.
</p>
<p>1922.
</p>
<p>"We, the undersigned jurors, find from
</p>
<p>the evidence that the deaths of decedents
</p>
<p>were due to the act, direct and indirect,
</p>
<p>of the officials of the Southern Illinois
</p>
<p>Coal Company. AVe recommend that an
</p>
<p>investigation be conducted for the
</p>
<p>purpose of fixing the blame personally
</p>
<p>on the individuals responsible."
</p>
<p>The record also says that one man was
</p>
<p>burned with a hot iron; that a hot iron
</p>
<p>was used to mutilate the dead. It was
</p>
<p>also stated this was true by Editor Dro-
</p>
<p>beck who described how the word "scab"
</p>
<p>was branded on Supt. McDowell's body.
</p>
<p>Proof of a Plot
</p>
<p>That the massacre was the result of an
</p>
<p>organized movement is the conclusion
</p>
<p>drawn from the following statements:
</p>
<p>It was a seemingly well organized,
</p>
<p>remarkably sober, determined, resolute
</p>
<p>aggregation of men and boys fighting, as
</p>
<p>they put it in their own words "to pre-
</p>
<p>serve the unions,"

</p>
<p>At daybreak the 3,000 armed citizens
</p>
<p>(surrounding the mine) realizing that the

<p>seen in the vicinity, worked their way
</p>
<p>into the stronghold of the outlaws and
</p>
<p>captured those that remained alive.
</p>
<p>36
</p>
<p>Several of those that were taken from the
</p>
<p>pit alive were taken to the woods near
</p>
<p>Herrin , where later they were found dead
</p>
<p>and dying. There were no riots, merely
</p>
<p>the citizens of the county acting in the
</p>
<p>only way left them for the safety of their
</p>
<p>homes. The faces of the men who were
</p>
<p>killed in the disturbance are horrible
</p>
<p>sights. Uncouth, as all crooks must be
</p>
<p>at the beginning, they were doubly un-
</p>
<p>attractive as seen after justice had
</p>
<p>triumphed and the county had again re-
</p>
<p>sumed its normal peace-time behavior.
</p>
<p>Editor Sims in the Christopher Progress
</p>
<p>says:
</p>
<p>The whole of Williamson and Franklin
</p>
<p>counties was in turmoil until late Thurs-
</p>
<p>day and on Wednesday afternoon the
</p>
<p>miners in Zeigler and West Frankfort
</p>
<p>were canvassing the business districts
</p>
<p>and homes for arms and ammunition,
</p>
<p>and we doubt whether there was much of
</p>
<p>either one left in their towns after the
</p>
<p>cars had left for the scene on Wednesday
</p>
<p>evening.
</p>
<p>We have talked to several who were
</p>
<p>near the scene of rioting and many have
</p>
<p>reported to us that no city in the com-
</p>
<p>munity showed their colors so much as
</p>
<p>the city of Zeigler which is located in
</p>
<p>Franklin County. At least three hundred
</p>
<p>strong men journeyed in cars from
</p>
<p>Zeigler on Wednesday evening and al-
</p>
<p>most every car was loaded with men,'
</p>

<p>More than a month after the massacre
</p>
<p>scarcely a visible effort has been made to
</p>
<p>discover or punish perpetrators of the
</p>
<p>crime. The press of the country united
</p>
<p>in condemning the ghastly outrage and
</p>
<p>demanded action but none has been taken.
</p>
<p>37
</p>
<p>State and local officials have taken the
</p>
<p>position that it would be impossible to fix
</p>
<p>the responsibility because Unionism con-
</p>
<p>trolled Williamson County. In the mean-
</p>
<p>time the bodies of the unidentified dead
</p>
<p>have been buried in Potters Field.
</p>
<p>Shall the assassins of innocent American
</p>
<p>citizens go unpunished?
</p>
<p>It cannot be possible that Illinois will
</p>
<p>not take further official cognizance of these
</p>
<p>infamous acts, as the first and last tribunal
</p>
<p>of the country, our American citizenship,
</p>
<p>will demand that lawlessness, murder and
</p>
<p>massacre are not and never shall be per-
</p>
<p>mitted to undermine the security of not
</p>
<p>only the nation's industries, but the very
</p>
<p>lives and homes of our people.
