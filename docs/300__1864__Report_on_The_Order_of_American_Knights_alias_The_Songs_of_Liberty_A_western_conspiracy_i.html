<p>Major Genbrai. MEAoa  " Dismissing, as
</p>
<p>aow useless to discuss, all questions as to the
</p>
<p>origin ef this war, we have daily and hoarly
</p>
<p>evidences that it exists, and that it can oTdy be
</p>
<p>terminated by hard fighting, and bj datermined
</p>
<p>efforts to overcome the armed enemies of the
</p>
<p>Government."
</p>
<p>Major GiiffERAL Buessidb: "Would it not
</p>
<p>be cowardly for us to say that this rebellion
</p>
<p>cannot be crushed, and the authority of the Go-
</p>
<p>vernment sustained? There is, in my mind,
</p>
<p>no question of it. There can be no such thing
</p>
<p>as laying down of arms or cessation of hostili-
</p>
<p>ties, until the entire authority of the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment is acknowledged by every citizen of our
</p>
<p>couaitry."
</p>
<p>Major Geneeai, Logan i "The greatest vic-
</p>
<p>tory of the rebels, greater than fltty Manas-
</p>
<p>eases, and the only one that can give them a
</p>
<p>particle of hope, will be to defeat the war party
</p>
<p>at the incoming campaign."
</p>
<p>Major General Wool : "Nothing, for aught
</p>
<p>that I can discover, will save the Union and its
</p>
<p>Government but the Buecesses of Grant, Sher-
</p>
<p>man, Farragut, and Sheridan."
</p>
<p>Major General Sherman : "To stop the war
</p>
<p>we must defeat the rebel armies that Ere ar-
</p>
<p>rayed against the laws and Constitution, which
</p>
<p>all must respect and obey."
</p>
<p>Major General Dix: " It has been my con-
</p>
<p>viction from the beginning that we can have
</p>
<p>BO honorable peace until the insurgent armies
</p>
<p>are dispersed and the leaders of the rebellioa
</p>
<p>expelled from the country. I believe that a

</p>
<p>cessation of hostilities would lead inevitably
</p>
<p>and directly to a recognition of the insurgent
</p>
<p>States; and when I say this I need hardly add
</p>
<p>that I can have no part in any political move-
</p>
<p>ment of which the Chicago platform is the
</p>
<p>basis. No, fellow-citizens, the only hope of
</p>
<p>securing an honorable peace  a peace which
</p>
<p>shall restore the Union and the Constilution 
</p>
<p>lies in a steady, persistent, end unremitting
</p>
<p>prosecution of the war."
</p>
<p>HMajor General Sickles: "I yield to no
</p>
<p>ciiizen or soldier in my eolicitude for the hono-
</p>
<p>cable termination of the war. The war was
</p>
<p>delibsrately began by the rebels, and is persis-
</p>
<p>tently waged bylhemto.divide and conquer the
</p>
<p>Union. It is not so strange that our enemies
</p>
<p>could find allies among uropeaa antagonists
</p>
<p>of free institutions, but it will never raaat
</p>
<p>be a matter of humiliation and wonder that our
</p>
<p>own people should be seriously divided upon
</p>
<p>the question of submission or resistance. Let
</p>
<p>who will be for submission, I am for resistance
</p>
<p>as long as we have a battalion and a battle-field
</p>
<p>left. Until the Constitution and laws are vin-
</p>
<p>dicated in their supremacy throughout the land,
</p>
<p>the Government should be confided to no hands
</p>
<p>that will hesitate to employ all the power of
</p>
<p>ihe nation to put down the rebellion."
</p>
<p>Major General Butler, in a letter to Hon.
</p>
<p>Simon Cameron, says: "It seems to me the
</p>
<p>plain duty of every loyal man to support the
</p>
<p>election of Lincoln'and Johnson.
</p>
<p>"Can it be that any true man, especially any
</p>
<p>Andrew Jackson Democrat, can desire this 60-

<p>pafsoaa, I have now the honor to etibmit ae
</p>
<p>COMOWS :
</p>
<p>Baring more than a year past, it has been
</p>
<p>{^nerally known to oar military authorities
</p>
<p>'Chat a secret treasonable organization, affiliated
</p>
<p><fth the Southern rebellion and chiefly military
</p>
<p>in tts character, has been rapidly extending
</p>
<p>Ktaelf throughout the West. A variety of agca-
</p>
<p>i^es, which will be speciied herein, have been
</p>
<p>employetl, and successfully, to ascertain its ca-
</p>
<p>tore and extent, as well as its aims and its re-
</p>
<p>mits ; and, as this investigation has led to the
</p>
<p>MTest iu several States of a number of its promi-
</p>
<p>nent members as dangerous enemies to their
</p>
<p>tiountry, it, has been deemed proper to set forth
</p>
<p>in full the acts and purposes of this organixa-
</p>
<p>tJtOQ, and thus to make known to the cosntry
</p>
<p>'Ct large its intensely treasonable and revo-
</p>
<p>'r5vJonary spirit.

</p>
<p>I. ITS ORIGIN, HISTORT, NAMES, &0.
</p>
<p>This secret association first developed itse.lf
</p>
<p>.; th3 West in the year 1863, about the period
</p>
<p>j: the first conscription of troops, which it
</p>
<p>aimed to obstruct and resist. Originally known
</p>
<p>Lb certain localities as the " Mutual Protection
</p>
<p>Society," the " Circle of Honor," or the " Oir-
</p>
<p>als" or '-Knights of the Mighty Host," but
</p>
<p>more widely as the "Knights of the Golden
</p>
<p>Circle," it was simply an inspiratioa of the rd-
</p>
<p>c.eUion, being little other than an extension
</p>
<p>tiEioag the dietloval and disaffected at the North
</p>
<p><9f the association of the l.ttter name, which
</p>
<p>iitd existed for some years at the Southland
</p>
<p>:om which it derived all the chief features of
</p>
<p>c organieatioQ.
</p>
<p>During the summer and fall of 1663, the
</p>
<p>Jr-der, both at the North and youth, underwent
</p>
<p>.:om3 modidcations as well as a change of
</p>
<p>ruime. in ccnseqaence of a partial exposnre
</p>
<p>wkich had been mide of the signs and secret
</p>
<p>forms of the " Knights of the Golden Circle,"
</p>
<p>g^orling Price had instituted as its successor in
</p>
<p>Miscouri a secret political association, which be
</p>
<p>cfisUcd the " Corps de Belgique," or ' Sonthem
</p>
<p>lt<eagae i" bia principal coadjutor oeing Chacies
</p>
<p>L. Hunt, of 8^. Louis, then Belgian Consul afc
</p>
<p>tht city, but whoso 6Xfl5Ti<w was eubeequentiy
</p>
<p>revoked by the President on account of Lis dis-
</p>
<p>loyal practices. The special object of tfa
</p>
<p>Corps de Belgique appears to have been to unite
</p>
<p>York, and other parts of the North, the secret
</p>
<p>political asBOciatiOQ known as ihe "'' McCUllafi
</p>
<p>Mniiie Guard " would seem to be a branch of
</p>
<p>the O. A. K., having snbstantially the same ob-
</p>
<p>jects, to be accomplished, however, by means
</p>
<p>expressly snited to the localities in which it is
</p>
<p>established. For, as the Chief Secretary of this
</p>
<p>association, Dr. K. F. Stevens, stated in Jane
</p>
<p>last to a reliable witness whose testimony has
</p>
<p>been furnished, "those who represent the Me-
</p>
<p>Clellan interest are compelled to preach a vigo-
</p>
<p>rous prosecution of the war, in order to secure
</p>
<p>tibe popular sentiment and allure voters."
</p>
<p>B.  ITS ORGAOTZATION AND OFFICERS.
</p>
<p>From printed copies, heretofore seized by the
</p>
<p>Government, of the constitutions of the Supreme
</p>
<p>eouncil. Grand CoxmcU, and County Parent
</p>
<p>Temples, respectively, of the Order of Sons of
</p>
<p>Mberty, in connection with other and abundant
</p>
<p>testimony, the organization of the order, in its
</p>
<p>latest form, is ascertained to be as follows:
</p>
<p>1. The government of the order throughout
</p>
<p>the "United States is vested in a supreme coun-
</p>
<p>cil, of which the oflScers are a supreme com-
</p>
<p>mander, secretary of state, and treasurer. These
</p>
<p>officers are elected for one year, at the annual
</p>
<p>meeting of the supreme council, which is made
</p>
<p>sp of the grand commanders of the several
</p>
<p>States, ex o^lcio, and two delegates elected from
</p>
<p>each State in which the order is established.
</p>
<p>3. The government of the order in a State is
</p>
<p>vested in a Grand Council, the officers of which
</p>
<p>are a Grand Commander, Deputy Grand Com-
</p>
<p>mander, Grand Secretary, Grand Treasurer, and
</p>
<p>a certain number of Major Generals, or one for

</p>
<p>each Military District. These officers also are
</p>
<p>elected annually by "representatives" &*om the
</p>
<p>County Temples, each Temple being entitled to
</p>
<p>two representatives, and one additional for each
</p>
<p>thousand members. This body of representa-
</p>
<p>tives is also invested with certain legislative
</p>
<p>fonctions.
</p>
<p>3. The Parent Temple is the organization of
</p>
<p>the order for a county, each temple being
</p>
<p>formally instituted by authority of the Supreme
</p>
<p>Council, or of the Grand CouncU or Grand
</p>
<p>Commander of the State. By the same au-
</p>
<p>thority, or by that of the officers of the Parent
</p>
<p>Temple, branch or subordinate temples may be
</p>
<p>established for townships in the county.
</p>
<p>But the strength and significance of this or-
</p>
<p>ganization lie in its military character. The
</p>
<p>secret constitution of the Supreme CouncU pro-
</p>
<p>vides that the Supreme Commander " s^^K &e
</p>
<p>commander-in- chief of all military Jorces belong-
</p>
<p>ing io the order in tJis various States when called
</p>
<p>into actual service;^' and further, that the Grand
</p>
<p>Commanders '^ shall be commande-rs-in-chiej of
</p>
<p>tlie military forces of their respective fitates. 8ul>-
</p>
<p>ordinate to the Grand Commander in the State
</p>
<p>are the " Major Oeit^rcds,'* each of whom com-
</p>
<p>mands his separate district and army. In In-
</p>
<p>diana the Major Generals are four in number.
</p>
<p>In Illinois, where the orgaaization of the Order
</p>
<p>ia considered most perfectjthe members in each
</p>
<p>Congressional District corapoea a ''brigade,'"
</p>
<p>whid is commanded i.y a ''Brigaditv General."
</p>
<p>The members of each county consiitute a ''^regi-
</p>
<p>raeM," with a '^oolonel" iii command, and
</p>
<p>t^sa of each township form a -' company.^' A
</p>
<p>5
</p>
<p>howover frequently the concplratorB may cliange
</p>
<p>its name, forms, passwords, snd signals., its true
</p>
<p>pocpoB^e and opcrDtionc cannot longer be con-
</p>
<p>cealed from the military authorities.
</p>
<p>It is to be remarked that the Supreme Coun
</p>
<p>Gil of the order, which annually meets on Feb-
</p>
<p>roacy23, convened this year at Now York city,
</p>
<p>aud a special meeting was then appointed to be
</p>
<p>held at Chicago, on July 1, or just prior to the
</p>
<p>day then fixed for the convention of the Demo
</p>
<p>cratic party. This convention having been
</p>
<p>3>BtpoBed to August 29, the special meeting of
</p>
<p>tfao Supreme Council was also postponed to
</p>
<p>. August 27, at the same place, and was duly
</p>
<p>convened accordingly. It will be remembered
</p>
<p>that a leading member of the convention, in
</p>
<p>the course of a speech made before that body,
</p>
<p>-aliaded approvingly to the session of the Sons
</p>
<p>f Liberty at Chicago at the same time, as that
</p>
<p>of an organ.zation in harmony with the senti-
</p>
<p>aient and projects of the convention.
</p>
<p>It may be observed, in conclusion, that one
</p>
<p>n.ot fully acquainted with the true character and
</p>
<p>intention of the order might well suppose that,
</p>
<p>la designating its officers by high military titles,
</p>
<p>-and in imitating in its organization that esta-
</p>
<p>WiBhed in our armies, it was designed merely to
</p>
<p>tender itself more popular and attractive with
</p>
<p>the masses, and to invest its chiefs with a cer^
</p>
<p>taia sham dignity; but when it is understood
</p>
<p>that the order comprises within itself a large
</p>
<p>army of well-armed men, constantly drilled
</p>
<p>and CKercised as soldiers, and that this army is
</p>
<p>held ready at any time for such forcible resist-

</p>
<p>ance to our military authorities, and euch active
</p>
<p>cooperation with the public enemy as it may be
</p>
<p>called upon to engage in by its commanders, it
</p>
<p>will be perceived that the titles of the latter are
</p>
<p>not aesamed for a mere purpose of display, but
</p>
<p>tbat they are the chiefs of an actual and formi-
</p>
<p>nJ able force of conspirators against the life of
</p>
<p>tike Government, and that their military system

</p>
<p>taent fr its army operations."
</p>
<p>lit.  ITS BXTBNT AND NUMBERS.
</p>
<p>The "Temples" or "Lodges" of the order
</p>
<p>are numerously scattered through the States of
</p>
<p>Ijadiana, Illinois, Ohio, Missouri, and Ken-
</p>
<p>tuoky. They are also officially reported as
</p>
<p>established, to a less extent, in Michigan
</p>
<p>arxd the other Western States, as well
</p>
<p>as in New York, and also in Pennsylvania,
</p>
<p>New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connebticut,
</p>
<p>!New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, and Tennes-
</p>
<p>see. ^Sodd, the Grand Commander of Indiana,
</p>
<p>in ao^address to the members in that State of
</p>
<p>February last, claims that at the next annual
</p>
<p>meeting of the Supreme Council Hn February,
</p>
<p>1665), every State in the Union will be repre-
</p>
<p>sented, and adds, "this is the first and only
</p>
<p>true national organization the Democratic and
</p>
<p>Conservative men of the country have ever at-
</p>
<p>tempted-" A provision made in the constitu-
</p>
<p>tion of the Council for a representation from the
</p>
<p>Territories shows, indeed, that the widest ex-
</p>
<p>tension of the order is contemplated.
</p>
<p>In the States first mentioned the order is most
</p>
<p>strongly centred at the following places, where
</p>
<p>6
</p>
<p>vided with weapoBS, and ia some localities it
</p>
<p>^s been abeolutely required that each member
</p>
<p>fihonld keep at his residence, at all times, cer-
</p>
<p>tain arms and a specified quantity of ammiinj-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>In March last, the entire armed force of the
</p>
<p>order, eapable of being mobilized for effective
</p>
<p>service, was represented to be SiO.OOO men.
</p>
<p>The details, however, upon which this state-
</p>
<p>ment was based are imperfectly set forth in
</p>
<p>the testimony, and it is not known how far this
</p>
<p>number may be exaggerated. It is abundantly
</p>
<p>shown, however, that th order, by means of a
</p>
<p>*ax levied xjpon its members, has accumulated
</p>
<p>considerable lunds for the purchase of arms
</p>
<p>and ammunition, and that these have been
</p>
<p>procured in large quantities for its use. The
</p>
<p>witness Clayton, on the trial of Dodd, esti-
</p>
<p>mated that two-thirds of the order are furnished
</p>
<p>with arms.

<p>in Missouri, states in his confession of July
</p>
<p>last: "I know that arms, mostly revolvers, and
</p>
<p>ammunition have been purchased by members
</p>
<p>in St. Louis to send to members in the country
</p>
<p>where they could not be had;" and he subse-
</p>
<p>quently adds that he himself alone clandes-
</p>
<p>tinely purchased and forwarded, between April
</p>
<p>15th and 19th last, about 20 revolvers, with
</p>
<p>5,600 percussion caps and ether ammunition.
</p>
<p>A muster roll of one of the country lodges of
</p>
<p>that State is exhibited, in which, opposite the
</p>
<p>name of each member, are noted certain num-
</p>
<p>bers, under the heads of "Missouri Republi-

<p>and "Reports;" titles which, when interpre-
</p>
<p>t.ed, severally signify single-barrelled guns, dou-
</p>
<p>T)l0-bar relied guns, revolvers, private ainmunitieny
</p>
<p>private lead, company powder, company had;
</p>
<p>iheroU thus actually setting forth the amount
</p>
<p>of arms and ammunition in the possession Ol
</p>
<p>the lodge and its members.
</p>
<p>In the States of Ohio and Illinois, tbe order
</p>
<p>is claimed by its members to be unusually well
</p>
<p>armed with revolvers, carbines, &c. ; but it is in
</p>
<p>regard to the arming of the order iu Indiana
</p>
<p>that the principal statistics have been presented,
</p>
<p>and these may serve to illustrate the sys-
</p>
<p>tem which has probably been pursued in most
</p>
<p>of the States. One intelligent witness, who has
</p>
<p>been a member of the order, estimates that ia
</p>
<p>March last there were in possession f the
</p>
<p>order in that State 6,00 muskets and 60,000 re-
</p>
<p>volvers, besides private arms. Another member
</p>
<p>testifies that at a single lodge meeting of two
</p>
<p>hundred and fifty- two persons, which he attend-
</p>
<p>ed early in the present year, the sum of $4,000
</p>
<p>was subscribed for arms. Other members pre-
</p>
<p>sent statements iu regard to the number oi:
</p>
<p>arms iu their respective counties, and all agree
</p>
<p>in representing that these have been constantly
</p>
<p>forwarded from Indianapolis into the interior.
</p>
<p>Beck & Brothers is designated as the firm in
</p>
<p>that city to which most of the arms were con-
</p>
<p>signed. These were shipped principally from
</p>
<p>the East; pome packages, however, were sent
</p>
<p>from Cincinnati, and some from Kentucky, and
</p>
<p>the boxes were generally marked "pick-axes,"
</p>
<p>of as msny Governmeat arms and equipments
</p>
<p>as poseMe, for the future use of the order.
</p>
<p>Again it was proposed that all the members
</p>
<p>shotfld enroll themselves in the militia, instead
</p>
<p>of paying commulation, in this way obtaining
</p>
<p>possession of United States arms, and having
</p>
<p>the advantage of the drill and military instruc-
</p>
<p>tion. In the council^ of the order in Kentucky
</p>
<p>in June last, a scheme was devised for disarm-
</p>
<p>faig all the negro troops, v?hich it was thought
</p>
<p>cot^d be done withoui. much difiiculty, and ap-
</p>
<p>pi'opriating their arms for the purposes of the
</p>
<p><5 Order.
</p>
<p>The despicable treachery of these proposed
</p>
<p>plans, as evincing the ayiimus of the conspi-
</p>
<p>racy, need not be commented upon.
</p>
<p>It is to be observed that the order in the
</p>
<p>State of Missouri has counted greatly upon
</p>
<p>support from the enrolled militia, in case of an
</p>
<p>invasion by Price, as containing many mem-
</p>
<p>bers and friends of the O. A. K.; and that the
</p>
<p>"Paw-Paw militia," a military organization of
</p>
<p>Buohanan county, as well as the militia of
</p>
<p>Platte and Clay counties, known as "Flat
</p>
<p>Foots," have been relied upon, almost to a
</p>
<p>man, to join the revolutionary movement.
</p>
<p>V. ITS RITUAL, OATHS, AND INTERIOIl TORMS.
</p>
<p>The ritual of the order, as well as its secret
</p>
<p>signs, passwords, &c., has been fully made
</p>
<p>known lo the military authorities. In August
</p>
<p>last, one hundred and twelve copies of the
</p>
<p>ritual of the O. A. K. were seized in the office of
</p>
<p>Hon. D. W. Voorhees, JI. C, at Terre Haute,
</p>
<p>and a large number of rituals of the O. 8.
</p>
<p>L., together with copies of the constitutions of

</p>
<p>the councils, &c., already referred to, were
</p>
<p>found in the building at Indianapolis, occu-
</p>
<p>pied by Dodd, the Grand Commander oflndi-
</p>
<p>anna, as iiad been indicated by the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment wit^gs and detective, Stidger. Copies
</p>
<p>were also discovered at Louisville, at the resi-
</p>
<p>dence of Dr. Kalfus, concealed within the
</p>
<p>mattress of his bed, where, also, Stidger had
</p>
<p>ascertained that they were kept.
</p>
<p>The ritual of the O. A. K. has also been fur-
</p>
<p>nished by the authorities at St. Louis. From
</p>
<p>tihis ritual, that of the O. S. L. does not mate-
</p>
<p>rially differ. Both are termed "progressive,"
</p>
<p>in^lhat they provide for ^ye separate degrees of
</p>
<p>membership, and contemplate the admission of
</p>
<p>a member of a lower degree into a higher one
</p>
<p>only upon certain vouchers and proofs of fit-
</p>
<p>ness, which, with each ascending degree, are re-
</p>
<p><iuired lo be stronger and more imposing.
</p>
<p>Each degree has its commander or head ; the
</p>
<p>Fourth or "Grand" is the highest in a State; the
</p>
<p>Fjifth or " Supreme," the highest in the United
</p>
<p>States ; but to the first or lower degree only do
</p>
<p>ttie great majority of members attain. A large
</p>
<p>proportion of these enter the order, supposing
</p>
<p>it to be a " Democratic " and political associa-
</p>
<p>tion merely ; and the history of the order
</p>
<p>furnishes a most striking illustration of the
</p>
<p>gnss and criminal deception which may be
</p>
<p>practised upon the ignorant masses by un-
</p>
<p>acnpnlous and unprincipled leaders. The mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the lower degree are often for a con-
</p>
<p>siderable period kept quite unaware of the true
</p>
<p>purposes of their chiefs. Bat to the latter they
</p>
<p>are bound by their obligation" to yield prompt
</p>
<p>Beside the oaths and other forms and cere-
</p>
<p>mo..ies which have been alluded to, the ritual
</p>
<p>c<!>Jitains what are termed " Declarations of
</p>
<p>Fi'iiieiipiee." These declaretionB, which are
</p>
<p>most important as exhibiting the creed and
</p>
<p>bliaracteir of the order, as inspired by the prin-
</p>
<p>ciples of the rebellion, will be liilly presented
</p>
<p>tmder the next branch of the subject.
</p>
<p>The signs, signals, passwords, Ac, of the order
</p>
<p>st'e set forth at length in the testimony, but
</p>
<p>jneed only be briefly alluded to- It is a most
</p>
<p>significant fact, as showing the intimate rela-
</p>
<p>tions between the northern and southern sections
</p>
<p>of the secret conspiracy, that a member from a
</p>
<p>Northern Stg.te is enabled to pass without risk
</p>
<p>through the South by the use of the signs of re-
</p>
<p>cognition which have been established through-
</p>
<p>out the order, and by means of which members
</p>
<p>fcomdistantpoints,thoughmeeting as strangers,
</p>
<p>are at once made known to each others as "bro-
</p>
<p>thers." Mary Ann Pitman expressly states In
</p>
<p>h/6T testinaony that whenever important de-
</p>
<p>spatches are required to be sent by rebel gene-
</p>
<p>rais beyond their lines, members of the order
</p>
<p>are always selected to convey them. Certain
</p>
<p>passwords are also used in common in both sec-
</p>
<p>tions, and of these, none appears to be more
</p>
<p>familiar than the word "Nu-oh-lac," or the
</p>
<p>ttame " Calhoun" spelt backward, and which is
</p>
<p>employed upon entering a temple of the first
</p>
<p>degree of the O. A. K.  certainly a fitting pass-
</p>
<p>word to such dens of treason.
</p>
<p>Beside the signs of recognition, there are
</p>
<p>i~]ns oj warning and danger, for use at nigbt as
</p>
<p>well as by day; as, for instance, signs to

</p>
<p>warn members of the approach of United
</p>
<p>States officials seeking to make arrests.
</p>
<p>IJhe order has also established "what are
</p>
<p>called baiUe-signals, by means of "which, as
</p>
<p>is, ia asserted, a member serving in the army
</p>
<p>may communicate with the enemy in the field,
</p>
<p>ajad thus escape personal harm in case of attack
</p>
<p>or capture. The most recent of these signals
</p>
<p>represented lo have |been adopted by the order
</p>
<p>iii a hve-pointed copper star, worn under the
</p>
<p>iMit, which is to be disclosed upon meeting an
</p>
<p>eiaeji V, who will thus recognize in the wearer
</p>
<p>a sympathizer and an ally. A similar star of
</p>
<p><jrrman silver, hung in a frame, is said to be
</p>
<p>aumerously displayed by members or their fa-
</p>
<p>milies in private houses in Indiana, for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose oi insuring protection to their property in
</p>
<p>case of a raid or other attack ; and it is stated
</p>
<p>that in many dwellings in that State, a portrait
</p>
<p>of John Morgan is exhibited for a similar pui"-
</p>
<p>pose.
</p>
<p>Other signs are used by members, and espe-
</p>
<p>cially the officers of the order, in their corre-
</p>
<p>spondence. Their letters, when of an official
</p>
<p>chaiacter, are generally conveyed by special
</p>
<p>messengers, but when transmitted through the
</p>
<p>mail, are usually in cipher. When written in
</p>
<p>the ordinary manner, a character at the foot of
</p>
<p>the latter, consisting of a circle with a line
</p>
<p><'urawn across the centre, signities to the mem-
</p>
<p>ber who receives it that the statements as writ-
</p>
<p>ten are to be understood in a eense direoliy the
</p>
<p>opposite to that which would ordinarily be con<-
</p>
<p>veyed.
</p>
<p>it is to be added that the meetings of the or-
</p>
<p>cordtiuco with the principles upon which is
</p>
<p>tOTindcd the Ameruran. theory, Government can
</p>
<p>aierciBC only delegated power ; hence, if those
</p>
<p>wlio bhall hBV3 been chosen to administer the
</p>
<p>(jroverament shall assume to exercise poweBS
</p>
<p>not delegated, they should be regarded and
</p>
<p>treated as usurpers. The reference to ' inherent
</p>
<p>power,' 'war power,' or 'military necessity.'
</p>
<p>on the part of the functionary for the sanction
</p>
<p>of an arbitrary exercise of power by him, we will
</p>
<p>not accept in palliation or excuse."
</p>
<p>To this is added, as a corollary, " it is in-
</p>
<p>compatible with the history and nature of our
</p>
<p>system of government that Federal authority
</p>
<p>should cotrce by arms a sovereign State."
</p>
<p>The declaration of principles, however, doee
</p>
<p>not stop here, but proceeds one step farther, as
</p>
<p>loUows :
</p>
<p>" Whenever the chosen officers or delegates
</p>
<p>shall fail or refuse to administer the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment in strict accordance with the letter of the
</p>
<p>accepted Constitution, it is the inherent right
</p>
<p>and the solemn and imperative duty of the peo-
</p>
<p>ple to resist the functionaries, and, if need be,
</p>
<p>to erpei them byjorce of arms ! Such resistance
</p>
<p>is not revolution, but is solely the assertion of
</p>
<p>right  the exercise of all the noble attributes
</p>
<p>which impart honor and dignity to manhood, "
</p>
<p>To the same effect, though in a milder tone.
</p>
<p>Is the platform of the order in Indiana, put
</p>
<p>forth by the Grand Council at their meeting in
</p>
<p>February last, which declares that " the right
</p>
<p>to alter or abolish their government, whenever
</p>
<p>it fails to secure the blessings of liberty, is one
</p>
<p>of the inalienable rights of the people that can

</p>
<p>aever be surrendered."
</p>
<p>Such then are the principles which the new
</p>
<p>member swears to observe and abide by in his
</p>
<p>obligation, set forth In the ritual, where he
</p>
<p>says: "I do solemnly promise that I will ever
</p>
<p>cherish in my heart of hearts the sublime creed
</p>
<p>oC the E. K. (Excellent Ejiights), and will, so
</p>
<p>far as in me lies, illustrate the same in my in-
</p>
<p>tercourse with men, and wiU defend the principles
</p>
<p>thereof, if need be, with my life, whensoever as-
</p>
<p>sailed, in my own country first of all. I do fur-
</p>
<p>liber solemnly declare that I will never take np
</p>
<p>arms in behalf of any government which does not
</p>
<p>acknowledge the sole authority or power to be
</p>
<p>the will of the governed."
</p>
<p>In the same connection may be quoted the
</p>
<p>following extracts from the ritual, as illustrat-
</p>
<p>ing the principle of the right of revolution
</p>
<p>aoii resistance to constituted authority in-
</p>
<p>sisted upon by the order:
</p>
<p>"Out swords shall be unsheathed whenever
</p>
<p>the great principles which we aim to inculcate
</p>
<p>and have sworn to maintain and defend are
</p>
<p>assaUed."
</p>
<p>Again. "I do solemenly promise, that when
</p>
<p>soever the principles which our order inenlcateb
</p>
<p>shall be assailed in my own State or country, 1
</p>
<p>willd*!fend these principles with my sword and
</p>
<p>my life, in whatsoever capacity may be assigned
</p>
<p>me by the competent authority of our order."
</p>
<p>And further: "I do promise that I will, at
</p>
<p>all times, if needs be, take up arms in thecause
</p>
<p>of the oppressed  in my own country first ot
</p>
<p>all  against any power or government usurped,
</p>
<p>which may be found in arms and waging war
</p>
<p>10
</p>
<p>si'der, 1 understood that its object was to aid
</p>
<p>and assist the Confederate Government, and
</p>
<p>endeavor to restore the Union as it was prior to
</p>
<p>this rebellion." He adds: "The order is hos-
</p>
<p>tile in every'respect to the General Government,
</p>
<p>and friendly" to the so-called Confederate tO-
</p>
<p>Temment. It is exclnsively made np of dis-
</p>
<p>loyal persons  of all Democrats who are desi-
</p>
<p>Toas of securing the independence of the Con-
</p>
<p>federate States, with a view of restorjas; the
</p>
<p>Union as it was."
</p>
<p>it would be idle to comment on such gib-
</p>
<p>berish as the statement that "the independence
</p>
<p>of the Confederate States" was t& be used as
</p>
<p>tke means of restoring "the Union as it was;"
</p>
<p>and jet, under the manipulations of these
</p>
<p>trattorous jugglers, doubtless the brains of
</p>
<p>many have been so far muddled as to accept
</p>
<p>tbis shameless declaration as true.
</p>
<p>But to proceed to the specific purposes of the
</p>
<p>rder, which its leaders have had in view froiD
</p>
<p>the beginning, and which, as will be seen, it
</p>
<p>has been able, in many cases, t& carry oiit with
</p>
<p>very considerable success, the following are
</p>
<p>found to be most pointedly presented by the
</p>
<p>iestimony.
</p>
<p>1. Aidmg Soldiersto Desert, a'/id Sarhoring and
</p>
<p>Protecting Deserters. ^arly in its history the
</p>
<p>Brder essayed to undermine such portions of
</p>
<p>the army as were exposed to its insidious ap-
</p>
<p>proaches. Agents were sent by the K. G. C. into
</p>
<p>Ihe camps to introduce the order among the
</p>
<p>5ldiers, and those who became members were
</p>
<p>Instructed to induce as many of their compa-

</p>
<p>nions as possible to desert, and for this pur-
</p>
<p>pose the latter were furnished by the order with
</p>
<p>oroBey and citizens' clothing. Soldiers who
</p>
<p>hesitated at desertion, but desired to leave the
</p>
<p>army, were introduced to lawyers who engaged
</p>
<p>to furnish them some q^iasi legal pretest for so
</p>
<p>doing, and a certain attorney of Indianapolis,
</p>
<p>named Walpole, who was particularly con-
</p>
<p>spicuous in furnishing facflities of this cha-
</p>
<p>racter to soldiers who applied to him, has
</p>
<p>boasted that he has thus aided five hundred en-
</p>
<p>listed men to escape from their contracts.
</p>
<p>Through the schemes of the order in Indiana,
</p>
<p>whole companies were broken up; a large de-
</p>
<p>iachment. of a battery company, for instance,
</p>
<p>deserting on one occasion to the enemy, with
</p>
<p>two of its guns, and the camps were imbued
</p>
<p>with a spirit of discontent and dissatisfaction
</p>
<p>with the service. Some estimate of the num-
</p>
<p>lier of deserters at this time may t)e derived
</p>
<p>fc-om a report of the Adjutant General of In-
</p>
<p>diana, of January, in 18G3, setting forth that
</p>
<p>the number of deserters and absentees returned
</p>
<p>to the army through the post of Indisnapolis
</p>
<p>alone, daring the month of December, 1862,
</p>
<p>was nearly two thousand six hundred.
</p>
<p>As soon as arrests of these deserters began to
</p>
<p>be generally made, writs of habeas corpyis were
</p>
<p>issued in tneir cases by disloyal judges, and a
</p>
<p>considerable number were discharged thereon.
</p>
<p>In one instance m Indiana, where an oiBficer in
</p>
<p>charge of a deserter properly refused to obey thf
</p>
<p>writ, alter it had been suspended in STieh casets
</p>
<p>by the Presid-ent, his attachment for con-
</p>
<p>tempt was ordered by the chief justice
</p>
<p>11
</p>
<p>ao doubt, in most caseB, i.icittd by the order,
</p>
<p>and engaged in by its members. In Indiann
</p>
<p>nearly 209 porsoDS were indicted for conspiracy
</p>
<p>against the Government, resisting the draft,
</p>
<p>&C.. and about sixty of these were convicted.
</p>
<p>Where members of the order were forced int i
</p>
<p>tfae army by the draft, they were instructed, iu
</p>
<p>case they were pre\'tnted from presently es-
</p>
<p>caping, and were obliged to go to the Held, to
</p>
<p>nse their arms in battle against their fellow-
</p>
<p>EOtdiers, rather than the enemy, or, if possible,
</p>
<p>to desert to tJie enemy, by whom, through the
</p>
<p>signs of the order, they would be recognized
</p>
<p>Hid received as friends. It is to be added that
</p>
<p>whenever a member volunteered in the army, he
</p>
<p>was at OBce expelled from the order.
</p>
<p>S. Oircuiatlon of Disloyal cmd Treasonable Pvbli-
</p>
<p>JMPions,  The order, especially in Missouri, has
</p>
<p>secretly circulated throughout the country s
</p>
<p>great quantity of treasonable publications, as a
</p>
<p>means of extending its own power and influence,
</p>
<p>as well as ofgiving encouragement to the disloya!
</p>
<p>and inciting them to treason. Of these, some
</p>
<p>of the principal are the following: "Pollard's
</p>
<p>Southern History of the War," " Official Re-
</p>
<p>ports of the Confederate Government," "Life
</p>
<p>of Stonewall Jackson," pamphlets containing

<p>White House," "The Lincoln Catechism, or a
</p>
<p>Giid to the Presidential election of 1864,"

</p>
<p>have been carefully protected by this order ever
</p>
<p>since I have been a member." It is shown in
</p>
<p>the testimony to be customary in the rebel ser-
</p>
<p>vice to employ members of the order as spies,
</p>
<p>under the guise of soldiers furnished with fur-
</p>
<p>loughs to visit their homes within our lines.
</p>
<p>On coming within the territory occupied by our
</p>
<p>forces, they are harbored and supplied with in-
</p>
<p>formation by the order. Another class of spies
</p>
<p>claim to be deserters from the enemy, and at
</p>
<p>once seek an opportunity to lake the oath of al-
</p>
<p>legiance, which, however, though voluntarily
</p>
<p>taken, they claim to be administered while they
</p>
<p>are under a species of duress, and, therefore,
</p>
<p>not to be binding. Upon swearing; allegiance
</p>
<p>to the Government, the pretended deserter en-
</p>
<p>iBjages, with tbe assistance of the order, in col-
</p>
<p>lecting contraband goods or procuring intellj-
</p>

</p>
<p>other treasonable enterprise. In his official re-

</p>
<p>money, &c., men desiriag lo join the Southern
</p>
<p>service; and, in tlie lodges of the order in St.
</p>
<p>Louis and Northern Missouri, money has often
</p>
<p>been raised to purchase horses, arms, and equip-
</p>
<p>ments for soldiers about to b*! forwarded to
</p>
<p>the Southern army. In the latter State, par-
</p>
<p>ties empowered by Price, or by Grand Com-
</p>
<p>mander Hunt as his representative, to recruit
</p>
<p>for the rebel service, were nominally authorized
</p>
<p>to "locate lands,'' as it was expressed, and in
</p>
<p>their reports, which were formally made, the
</p>
<p>aumber of acres, &c. , located represented the
</p>
<p>aamber ef men recruited. At Louisville, those
</p>
<p>'desiring to join the Southern forces were kept
</p>
<p>Mdden, and supplied with food and lodging un-
</p>
<p>tU. a convenient occasion was presented for their
</p>
<p>transportation South. They were then collected,
</p>
<p>and conducted at night to a safe rendezvous of
</p>
<p>the order, whence they were forwarded to their
</p>
<p>destination, in some cases, stealing horses
</p>
<p>from the United States corrals on their way .
</p>
<p>Whila awaiting an occasion to be sent South,
</p>
<p>the men, to avoid the suspicion which
</p>
<p>might be excited by their being seen to-
</p>
<p>-gether in any considerable number, were often
</p>
<p>employed on farms in the vicinity of Louis-
</p>
<p>viile, and the farm of one Moore, in that neigh-
</p>
<p>'faorhood (at whose house also meetings of the
</p>
<p>order were held), is indicated in the testimony
</p>
<p>as one of the localities where such recruits
</p>
<p>were so rendezvoused and employed.
</p>
<p>The same facilities which were afforded to
</p>
<p>recruits for the Southern army were also

<p>furnished by the order to persons desiring to

</p>
<p>pose. By these Lonisville was generally pre-
</p>
<p>ferred as a point of departure, and, on the Mis-
</p>
<p>sissippi river, a particular steamer, the.Graham,
</p>
<p>was selected as the safest convenience.

</p>
<p>jjujn, &c.  In this, too, ;the order, and espe-
</p>
<p>cially its female members and allies, has been
</p>
<p>sedulously engaged. The rebel women of Lou-
</p>
<p>i-swlle and Kentucky are represented as having
</p>
<p>rendered the most valuable aid to the Southern
</p>
<p>army, by transporting very large quantities of
</p>
<p>percussion caps, powder, &c., concealed upon
</p>
<p>their persons, to some convenient locality near
</p>
<p>the lines, whence they could be readily con-
</p>
<p>veyed to those for whom they were intended,
</p>
<p>Lt is estimated that at Louisville, up to May 1
</p>
<p>last, the sum of $17,000 had been invested by
</p>
<p>the order in ammunition and arms .to be for-
</p>
<p>warded principally iu this manner to the rebels.
</p>
<p>In St. Louis several firms, who are well known
</p>
<p>to the Government, the principal of which is
</p>
<p>Beauvais & Co., have been engaged in supply-
</p>
<p>ing arms and ammunition to members of the
</p>
<p>order, to be conveyed to their Southern allies.
</p>
<p>Mary Ann Pitman, a reliable witness, and a
</p>
<p>member of the O. A. K,, who will herealter be
</p>
<p>specially alluded to, states in her testimony
</p>
<p>that she visited Beauvais & Co. three times, and
</p>
<p>procured from them on each occasion about
</p>
<p>$89 worth of caps, besides a number of pistols
</p>
<p>and cartridges, which she cawied in person to
</p>
<p>Forrest's command, beside a much larger
</p>
<p>quantity of similar articles which she caused to
</p>
<p>be forwarded by other agents. The guerillas in
</p>

</p>
<p>said, to bo tke signal for tiie rising ; but
</p>
<p>tbe postponement of the convention, as well
</p>
<p>as the failure of the rebel armies t engage in
</p>
<p>tbe anticipated movement, again operated to
</p>
<p>disturb the schemes of the order. IJoring the
</p>
<p>summer, however, the grand plan of action
</p>
<p>above set forth has been more than ever dis-
</p>
<p>tissed throughout the order, and its snccess
</p>
<p>Host confidently predicted, while at the same
</p>
<p>time an extensive organization and preparation
</p>
<p>for carrying their conspiracy into effect have been
</p>
<p>actively going on. But, up t* this time, not-
</p>
<p>withstanding the late raids of the enemy in
</p>
<p>Kentucky, and the invasion of Missouri by
</p>
<p>Price, no s^ch general action on the part of the
</p>
<p>order as was contemplated has taken place  a
</p>
<p>result, in great part, owing to the activity of our
</p>
<p>military authorities in strengtl\ening the detach-
</p>
<p>ments at the prisons, arsenals, &c., and in
</p>
<p>caasing the arrest of the leading conspirators
</p>
<p>in the several States, and especially in the seiz
</p>
<p>ure of Urge quantities of arms which had been
</p>
<p>shipped for the nsoof the order in their intended
</p>
<p>outbreak. It was, doubt loss, on account of these
</p>
<p>precautions that the day last appointed for tLe
</p>
<p>rising of the order in Indiana and Kentucky
</p>
<p>(Aflgiiot 16) passed by with but slight disordei.
</p>
<p>* It is, however, the inability of the public
</p>
<p>enemy, in the now declining days of the rebel-
</p>
<p>UoEo to initiate the desired movements which
</p>
<p>has prevented the order from engaging in open
</p>
<p>warfare; and it has lately been seriously con-
</p>
<p>sidered in their councils, whether they shou'd
</p>
<p>not proceed with their revolt, relying alone upon

<p>the guerilla hands of Sypheri, Jesse, and otherE ,
</p>
<p>lor support and assistance.
</p>
<p>With these guerillas the orderhas always most
</p>
<p>readily acted along the border. The latter, xn
</p>
<p>cases of the caoture by the Union forces of
</p>
<p>Northern xiiembers of the order engaged in co-
</p>
<p>operating with them, have frequently retaliated
</p>
<p>by seizing prominent Union citizens, and holding
</p>
<p>them as hostages for the release of their allies.
</p>
<p>At other times our Government has been offi-
</p>
<p>cially notitied by the rebel authorities that if
</p>
<p>the members of the order captured were no:
</p>
<p>treated by us as ordinary prisoners of war, re-
</p>
<p>taliation would be resorted to.
</p>
<p>An atrocious plan of concert between mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the order in Indiane and certain gnerilla
</p>
<p>bands of Kentucky, agreed upon last spring,
</p>
<p>may be remarked upon in this connection,
</p>
<p>dome 3,500 or 3^0Q0 guerillas were to be thrown
</p>
<p>into the border counties, and were to assume
</p>
<p>the character of refugees seeking employment.
</p>
<p>Being armed, they were secretly to destroy Go-
</p>
<p>vernment property wherever practicable, to con-
</p>
<p>trol tbe elections by force, prevent enlistments,
</p>
<p>aid deserters, and stir up strife between tbe
</p>
<p>civil and military authorities.
</p>
<p>A singular feature of tae raids of the enemy
</p>
<p>remains only to be adverted to, viz : that the
</p>
<p>ofiicers conducting these roids are furnished by
</p>
<p>the rebel Govern uieat wiih quantities of United
</p>
<p>States Treasury notes for iise within our lines,
</p>
<p>and til at these are probably most frequently
</p>
<p>procured through the atrency of memhere of

<p>or June last, itwas peoposed to form a secret
</p>
<p>police of members of the order for the purpose
</p>
<p>of patrolling the streets of that city at night
</p>
<p>sad killing every detective and soldier ttiat
</p>
<p>ceuld be readily disposed of; that thie proposi-
</p>
<p>tion was coolly considered, and finally rejected,
</p>
<p>aot because of its fiendish character  no voice
</p>
<p>betog raised against its criminality  but because
</p>
<p>only it was deemed premature. At Louisville,
</p>
<p>in June last, a similar scheme was discussed
</p>
<p>among the order forthe waylaying and butcher-
</p>
<p>iag of negro soldiers in the streets at night;
</p>
<p>and in the same month a party of its members
</p>
<p>ia that city was actually organized for the pnr-
</p>
<p>)o6e of throwing off the tf'ack cf the Nashville
</p>
<p>railroad a train of colored troops and seizing
</p>
<p>Cfae opportunity to take the lives of as many as
</p>
<p>possible. Again, in July^ the assassination of
</p>
<p>an obnoxious provost marshal, by betraying
</p>
<p> bim into the hands of guerillas, was designed
</p>
<p>by members in the interior of Kentucky. Far
</p>
<p>Aher, at a meeting of the Grand CouacU of In
</p>
<p>'iSiana at Indianapolis on June 14th last, the
</p>
<p>murder of ne CofB.H, a Goveru'Tnent detective,
</p>
<p>Avbo, as it was supposed, had betrayed the
</p>
<p>OTder, was deliberately difcussed and fully
</p>
<p>determined upon. This fact is stated by Stidger
</p>
<p>'.in his report to General Carringtoii o iJunelTth
</p>
<p>last, and is more fully set forth in his testimony
</p>
<p>mpon the trial of Dodd. He deposes that a
</p>
<p>the meeting in question, Dodd himself volun-
</p>
<p>'fieered to go to namifton, Ohio, where Coffin
</p>
<p>was espected to ha fotrnd, and there "dispose

</p>
<p>Jlaouisville, to Bowles and Dodd, at Indianapolis
</p>
<p>special instructions to have Coffin "put out o
</p>
<p>the way"  "murdered"  "at all hazards."
</p>
<p>The opinion is expressed by Colonel Sander-
</p>
<p>flon, under date of June 12 last, that "there-
</p>
<p>cent numerous cold-blooded assassinations of
</p>
<p>oiilitary officers and unconditional Union men
</p>
<p>throughout the military district of North Mis-
</p>
<p>souri, especially along the western border," is
</p>
<p>-to be ascribed to the agency of the order. The
</p>
<p>witness, Pitman, represents that it is "a part of
</p>
<p>:the obligation or understanding of the order" to
</p>
<p>Mil officers and eoldiers "ts.^sn5r ii can.be don^

<p>Among these, also, are soldiers at our prisoE

<p>4. Citizen prisoners, to whom, while in con-

<p>finement, disclosures were made relative to the
</p>
<p><;xistence, extent, and character of the order by
</p>
<p>fellow- prisoners who were leading members.
</p>
<p>and who, in some instances, upon becoming;
</p>
<p>intimate with the witness, initiated him into
</p>
<p>one of the degrees.
</p>
<p>5. Members of the order, who, upon a full
</p>
<p>acquaintance with its principles, have been
</p>
<p>appalled by its iafamous designs, and have
</p>
<p>voluntarily abandoned ii, freely making known
</p>
<p>their experience to our military authorities. In
</p>
<p>this cliss maybe placed the female witness,
</p>
<p>Mary Ann Pitman, who, though in arrest at
</p>
<p>the period of her disclosures, wai yet indacea

<p>to make them for the reason that, as she says,
</p>
<p>" at the last meeUng which I attended they
</p>
<p>passed an order which I consider as utterly
</p>
<p>atrocious and barbarous ; so I told them ]
</p>

</p>
<p>In the presence of the rebellion and of this se-
</p>
<p>cret order  -which is but its echo and faithful ally
</p>
<p> we cannot but be amazed at the ntter and wide-
</p>
<p>spread profligacy, personal and political, which
</p>
<p>tiese movements against the Govemmeat dis-
</p>
<p>elose. The guilty men engaged in them, after
</p>
<p>oaBting aside their allegiance, seem to have
</p>
<p>trodden ander foot every sentiment of honor
</p>
<p>and every restraint of law, human and divine.
</p>
<p>Jndea produced but one Judas Iscariot, and
</p>
<p>Rome, from the sints of her demoralizjtioTi,
</p>
<p>produced but one Cataline, and yet, as events
</p>
<p>prove, there has arisen together in our land an
</p>
<p>entire brood of such traitors, all animated by
</p>
<p>the same parricidal spirit, and all struggling
</p>
<p>with the same relentless maligaity for the

<p>dismerDberment of oor Unioit. Oi this
</p>
<p>extraordinary phenomenon  not paralleled, it
</p>
<p>is believed, in the world's history  there can
</p>
<p>be but one explanation, and all these blackened
</p>
<p>and fetid streams of crime may well be traced
</p>
<p>to the same common fountain. So fiercely
</p>
<p>intolerant and imperious was the temper en-
</p>
<p>j^endered by slavery, that when the Southern
</p>
<p>people, after having controlled the national
</p>
<p>CGUucils for half a. century, were beaten at an
</p>
<p>alecticn, their leadeiig turned upon the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment with the insolent fury with which they
</p>
<p>would have drawn their revolvers on a rebel-
</p>
<p>lious slave in one of their negro qu?trteTe; and

<p>they have continued since to prose cut their
</p>
<p>warfare, amid all the barbarisms and atroci-

<p>ties naturally and necessarily ic spired by the

<p>infernal institution in whose interests they are

<p>sacrificing alike themselves and their country.
</p>
<p>Many of these conspirators, as is well known,
</p>
<p>were fed, clothed, and educated at.the espenee

<p>of the nation, and were loaded with its honors

<p>the horrible criminality of a son stabbing tihe
</p>
<p>bosom of his own mother while impressing
</p>
<p>kisses on his cheeks. The leaders of the tsai-

<p>tors in the loyal States, who so completely fra-
</p>
<p>ternize with these conspirators, an.d whose ma-
</p>
<p>chinations are now unmasked, it is as clearly
</p>
<p>the duty of the Administration to proseente
</p>
<p>and punish, as it is its duty to subjagate the
</p>
<p>rebels who are openly in arms against the
</p>
<p>Government. In the performance of this diri,y,
</p>
<p>it is entitled to expect, and will doubtless re-

<p>ceive, the zealous cooperation of true men

<p>everywhere, who, ia crushing the truculeDt
