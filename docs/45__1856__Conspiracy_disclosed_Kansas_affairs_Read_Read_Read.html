<p>CONSPIRACY DISCLOSED!!
</p>
<p>KANSAS AFFAIRS.
</p>
<p>READ! READ!! READ!!!
</p>
<p>Read the following proof from the speech of
</p>
<p>Mr. Letcher, of the 2d of August, 1856, in the
</p>
<p>House of Representatives, that a conspiracy was
</p>
<p>entered into " immediately after the passage of
</p>
<p>Ihe Kansas-Nebraska act" by the Black Repub-
</p>
<p>lican members of Congress, to drive out pro-
</p>
<p>slavery settlers from Kansas, which has resulted
</p>
<p>in the recent scenes of violence and bloodshed
</p>
<p>there. Let it be borne in mind that this proof
</p>
<p>is extracted from the testimony of one of the
</p>
<p>conspirators themselves, (Mr. Mace, of Indiana.)
</p>
<p>It is proven, too, by the proceedings of the Emi-
</p>
<p>grant Aid Societies' Convention, held at Buffalo,
</p>
<p>lOth and 11th of July last, an account of which
</p>
<p>may be found in an article from the New York
</p>
<p>Journal of Commerce, on page 3, and in several
</p>
<p>other articles which follow it, all tending to prove
</p>
<p>this and other base purposes of the co'nspirators.
</p>
<p>The proceedings r<;.ferred to show very clearly
</p>
<p>that those misguided men actually contemplated
</p>
<p>civil tear in Kansas. Otherwise what did they
</p>
<p>want with "a hundred thousand dollars a
</p>
<p>MONTH," which one of their resolutions calls for?
</p>
<p>Gerrit Smith, who took part in the proceedings,
</p>
<p>was frank enough to express in words what the
</p>
<p>resolution left to be understood, and, therefore,
</p>
<p>subscribed "fifteen hundred dollars a month,
</p>
<p>DURING THE WAR." Morc rcccnt developments
</p>
<p>explain the mystery of the.se words. General
</p>
<p>Lane's army was soon after collected at Chicago,
</p>
<p>and marched into Kansas, through Iowa and
</p>
<p>Nebraska Territory. And scarcely had they

</p>
<p>reached their destination, than we-find them, and
</p>
<p>others, attacking and capturing the village of
</p>
<p>Franklin, breaking up a pro-slavery settlement
</p>
<p>n Washington creek, dispersing a colony of
</p>
<p>Georgians on the Ossawattomie, attacking and
</p>
<p>capturing Colonel Titus's house, near Lecomp-
</p>
<p>ton, and doing various other things in viola-
</p>
<p>tion of the Constitution. In short, they went
</p>
<p>to work as if determined to provoke somebody
</p>
<p>to fight them, and they have, at length, suc-
</p>
<p>ceeded. One of their " reverend" aiders and
</p>
<p>abettors. Rev. Mr. Nute, of Lawrence, Kansas,
</p>
<p>says, in a letter to the Springfield (Massachu-
</p>
<p>setts) Republican, dated August 23, 1856:
</p>
<p>" VVe are having war in earnest four fights within the
</p>
<p>last hve days, mail of ii'hich the free Stale men were tlie
</p>
<p>assailants and tlieviclors."
</p>
<p>If it be asked What was the object of getting
</p>
<p>up a war in Kansas .> it is answered, to help
</p>
<p>elect Fremont. For, the greater the disturbance
</p>
<p>in Kansas, the more clear would be the apparent
</p>
<p>"villainy" of repealing the Missouri compro-
</p>
<p>mise. This seems to have been the theory of
</p>
<p>the Black Republicans from the first; and, there-
</p>
<p>fore, they early began to show the cloven foot.
</p>
<p>Here is what Mr. Letcher says:
</p>
<p>When the Kansas territorial bill was under
</p>
<p>consideration here, the editorial leader of the
</p>
<p>present revolutionary party who wields the power
</p>
<p>in this House none other than Mr. Greeley, of
</p>
<p>the New York Tribune proclaimed that he would
</p>
<p>rather see this Capitol '< blaze by the tdrch of the
</p>
<p>incendiary," than that the Kansas bill should
</p>
<p>become a law.
</p>
<p>The following is an extract from one of hirf
</p>
<p>he could spare for such things, and felt that he
</p>
<p>was now called upon to contribute means to arm
</p>
<p>men and send them out to fight. He continued
</p>
<p>to urge at length the necessity for bold action.
</p>
<p>He quoted from speeches of Mr. Atchison, and
</p>
<p>Mr. Rives of Virginia, to prove that the South
</p>
<p>had declared they would never give up Kansas
</p>
<p>until they were forced to give up slavery. He
</p>
<p>had also better authority for this, and one which
</p>
<p>none in this convention would dispute. He had
</p>
<p>a letter from their own candidate for the Presi-
</p>
<p>dency, Colonel Fremont, who declared the same
</p>
<p>thing. Mr. Smith continued to speak of the ag-
</p>
<p>gressions of the South, and said he only hoped to
</p>
<p>hear of a collhlon al Topeka ; that he only desired
</p>
<p>to hear of a collision with the Federal troops, and
</p>
<p>that northern men had fallen, and then he icould hear
</p>
<p>of northern States arraying themselves against the
</p>
<p>Federal Government; and would that be the end?
</p>
<p>Jfo ! Mssowi ivould be the next battle-field, and
</p>
<p>then slavery would be driven to the wall. Her
</p>
<p>strength is only apparent; it consists half in
</p>
<p>northern cowards and doughfaces. It has been
</p>
<p>brave and rampant only because the North has
</p>
<p>Hed before it. It will run when the North faces
</p>
<p>it. He believed the time had come to use physical
</p>
<p>force. If the convention thought, with Governor
</p>
<p>Reeder, that such was not the fact, with all re-
</p>
<p>spect, he could have no sympathy with it.
</p>
<p>Governor Reeder replied* that he was not in
</p>
<p>favor of waiting because they had not received
</p>
<p>wrongs enough, but thought it right to wait until
</p>
<p>they could strike an effective blow. If it remained
</p>
<p>with him to use the power of the Government, he
</p>
<p>would not have waited thus long, but the oppress-

</p>
<p>ors, before this, tvould have been converted into
</p>
<p>heaps of dead men on the fields of Missouri; but lie
</p>
<p>was willing to wait till to-morrow, or two to-
</p>
<p>morrows. Whenon the trail of the enemy, against
</p>
<p>whom he had a deadly hate, he would follow him
</p>
<p>with cat-like tread, and would not strike until he
</p>
<p>could strike him dead. He was, therefore, will-
</p>
<p>ing to wait until they had the power he^would
</p>
<p>thus have used. He did not wish *to give the
</p>
<p>South notice of their intentions by marching
</p>
<p>armed men into the Territory. The dragoons
</p>
<p>couldgo in as voters, or to cultivate the soil, and strike
</p>
<p>when the right time arrived. When the right time
</p>
<p>came to strike, he wanted the South to have the
</p>
<p>first notice of the blow in the blow itself. The
</p>
<p>free-State party take the ground that they will
</p>
<p>exhaust all peaceful remedies; and that done,
</p>
<p>they will resist to the death, and pile the soil the
</p>
<p>Constitution no longer protects with heaps of
</p>
<p>their oppressors.
</p>
<p>Gerrit Smith thoughtif this chain of reasoning
</p>
<p>were correct, then the convention should sit with
</p>
<p>closed doors and not pass resolutions to raise one
</p>
<p>hundred thousand dollars a month. The South
</p>
<p>would be'silly if they did not know this money
</p>
<p>was to be raised for the purpose of doing some-
</p>
<p>thing with it.
</p>
<p>Near the close of the proceedings a collection
</p>
<p>was taken up.
</p>
<p>Gerrit Smith contributed FIFTEEN HUN-
</p>
<p>DRED DOLLARS A MONTH DURING
</p>
<p>THE WAR filling up a check on the State
</p>
<p>bank of Albany for the first installment.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whitman, of Kansas Territory, moved
</p>
<p>that a fund of :j<i25,000 be raised, to be loaned in
</p>
<p>strid Mr. Phillips fired from his house and killed two pro-
</p>
<p>slavery men. Forty sufferers arrived here to-day entirely
</p>
<p>destitute. Fuller particulars to-morrow."
</p>
<p>The same dispatch appeared in the New York
</p>
<p>Tribune of Saturday, which paper of that day-
</p>
<p>says in its editorial columns:
</p>
<p>" Our correspondent at St. Louis appears to he under the
</p>
<p>impression that the Mr. Phillips who, with his brother, has
</p>
<p>been shot, is the special Kansas correspondent of the Trib-
</p>
<p>une, whose death has long been an avowed object anion"
</p>
<p>the Missouri ruffians. This, however, is a mistake. Our
</p>
<p>Mr. Phillips recently left the Territory for a brief visit to
</p>
<p>the States, and on the day of the battle he was in this city.
</p>
<p>He is now returning, and will soon be at his post a^ain in
</p>
<p>Kansas." ,
</p>
<p>He was in this city on Friday, and came into
</p>
<p>Qur office, mistaking it for one of the Black Re-
</p>
<p>publican newspaper offices. He introduced him-
</p>
<p>self as the Kansas correspondent of the New
</p>
<p>York Tribune, on his return to the Territory.
</p>
<p>Without dispelling his illusion, we asked him
</p>
<p>" if U was probable such a row could be got up
</p>
<p>in Kansas as would subserve the Republican
</p>
<p>cause, and aid the election of Fremont.'" He
</p>
<p>said, " Yes, that is the intention, and I think we
</p>
<p>shall succeed; our plans are well laid, and can
</p>
<p>scarcely fail. We are determined that the icar
</p>
<p>shall last until JsTovember, of whatever cost. I shall
</p>
<p>be in Kansas in ten days, and I have instructions
</p>
<p>in my pocket for Colonel Lane." We asked him
</p>
<p>some other questions, which he answered with
</p>
<p>singular frankness, disclosing a conspiracy of the
</p>
<p>Black Republican leaders regarding Kansas more
</p>
<p>heinous and villainous, we verily believe, than
</p>
<p>any conspiracy ever before hatched. When we

</p>
<p>informed him that he had entered the wrong pew
</p>
<p>that he was in the office of a Democratic, and
</p>
<p>not of a Black Republican paper that he had
</p>
<p>been addressing a Buchanan, and not a Fremont
</p>
<p>man he was struck dumb with amazement, from
</p>
<p>which he did not instantly recover. When he
</p>
<p>did recover, he muttered something inaudibly,
</p>
<p>and incontinently fled.
</p>
<p>The information thus obtained assures us pos-
</p>
<p>itively of things we have not at any time doubted.
</p>
<p>It assures us that there have been but few diffi-
</p>
<p>culties in Kansas that were not the result of plans
</p>
<p>deliberately laid by Black Republican confeder-
</p>
<p>ates, and deliberately executed by the agents of
</p>
<p>these confederates; and it assures us tlfat pro-
</p>
<p>vision has been made of men and money by which
</p>
<p>Kansas will, if it be possible, be kept in the most
</p>
<p>terrible state of turmoil during this month and
</p>
<p>the next, for the sole purpose of exasperating the
</p>
<p>northern mind and affecting the presidential elec-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>We have no language to express abhorrence of
</p>
<p>the plotrevealed. Isitnotabominable, atrocious,
</p>
<p>hellish.' Could pirates be guilty of anything
</p>
<p>worse? Could devils concoct a more damnable
</p>
<p>scheme .' Civil war is instigated, innocent blood
</p>
<p>IS shed all in pursuance ot' caucus arrangement
</p>
<p>to influence the pending political contest! and
</p>
<p>such creatures as this Phillips are employed by
</p>
<p>the New York Tribune to chronicle the deeds of
</p>
<p>death actually committed, and to manufiicture
</p>
<p>"outrages "having no foundation in point of fact !
</p>
<p>When will the people see this Kansas business
</p>
<p>in Its true light.'

</p>
<p>there from the North and the South unless the incendia-
</p>
<p>ry's torch can light up their villages, and the murderer's
</p>
<p>rifle can proclaim its work to tlie inhabitants of the prai-

<p>ries  unless cut-throats can stalk unmolested, and iiioffens-

</p>
<p>which they have themselves created can be gratified v> the

</p>
<p>be spread over the country one arirr, at least, of the iia-
</p>
<p>lional defense shall be stricjsen down !"
</p>
<p>After giving an account of the Ivansas wing
</p>
<p>of the party of disunionists, the same paper
</p>
<p>says:
</p>
<p>"Take the facts here narrated in connection with the
</p>
<p>action of the House of Representatives, and is it not plain
</p>
<p>that the purpose of the Kepublicans is to involve the
</p>
<p>WHOLE fOUNTRV IN CIVIL WAR, AKTER TVISG THE HANDS
</p>
<p>OP THE Federal Government .'"
</p>
<p>The Dayton Empire says:
</p>
<p>" The Bloody Work of AuoiiTioNisM and Disunion-
</p>
<p>ism Commenced. From the telegraphic dispatches in our
</p>
<p>paper to-day, ourreaders will learn that the work of murder
</p>
<p>:uid outrage, of civil war and treason, has been commenced
</p>
<p>by Lane and his Abolition mercenaries and hirelings in
</p>
<p>Kansas. They are making war against the United States,
</p>
<p>rescuing prisoners from the hands of the United States au-
</p>
<p>thorities, burning the dwellings of peaceable citizens, and
</p>
<p>butchering those who lift a voice or a finger to stay them in
</p>
<p>their treasonable, incendiarj', and bloody work.
</p>
<p>" But the stain of outrage, and the blood of murdered
</p>
<p>citizens, does not rest alone upon the villain Lane and the
</p>
<p>wretches he commands ; it is upon the men who, Iw their
</p>
<p>money, have collected and sent his force into Kansas, and
</p>
<p>upon the men wTlo, by their sympathies and advice, have

</p>
<p>sustained his treason and rebellion."
</p>
<p>Speaking of the Kansas news, the Springfield
</p>
<p>Argus says:
</p>
<p>" And from the generality and e.ttent of the organization
</p>
<p>ot' the Black Republican forces, it seems clear that they
</p>
<p>have been organized on the assurance of their friends in
</p>
<p>Congress that the Army bill should be defeated, and that
</p>
<p>The signal for them to begin hostilities w.ls the adjournment
</p>
<p>of Congress, after having tied the hands of the Ext-culive
</p>
<p>so as to render liiin powerless to suppress insurreption ami
</p>
<p>prevent bloodsiied. It is, thcrefoie, clear as day that the
</p>
<p>Kepublicans meant to inaugurate civil war, and that the
</p>
<p>attack on the opposite party was concerted at Washinston,
</p>
<p>ijy the Black Republican majority in Congress. The defeat
</p>
<p>of the Army bill was necessary to the success of their plans
</p>
<p>of insurrection. The Black Republican House! did its i)art
</p>
<p>by defeating the bill, and immediately its partisans in Kan-
</p>
<p>sas lighted the flame of war. That their ultimate design is
</p>
<p>:o involve the whole Union in a bloody fratricidal conflict
</p>
<p>seems to be the only conclusion which can be drawn from
</p>
<p>llieiracts." ******
</p>
<p>"Thus the traitors have already unmasked their desper-
</p>
<p>ate designs. After this iris idle to deny that their aim is
</p>
<p>to bring about a forcible disruption of the Union. The
</p>
<p>nation is in danger from their fratricidal hands ! Let every
</p>
<p>patriot come to the rescue !"
</p>
<p>The Ohio Statesman, after reviewing the posi-
</p>
<p>tion of the disunionists, says:
</p>
<p>' A factious and treasonable, though accidental majority
</p>
<p>in the House of Jlepresentatives, seem resolved to continue
</p>
<p>the civil war in Kansas, and to strike down tlie Army, that
</p>
<p>tlie President shall not hav(! power to suppress that violence.
</p>
<p>Rather than sufTer political <lefeat, they would spread the
</p>
<p>devastation of civil war all over the northern and southern
</p>
<p>States. If the leaders of Black Republicanism could rally
</p>
<p>of obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assist-
</p>
<p>ance of counsel for his defense. Xixc privilege of habeas
</p>
<p><:rirpus shall not be suspended unless wlien, in case of re-
</p>
<p>bellion or invasion, the public safety may require it. In
</p>
<p>suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall
</p>
<p>exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be
</p>
<p>preserved, and no fact tried by jury shall be otherwise re-
</p>
<p>examined in any court of the United Slates than according
</p>
<p>to the rules of comiiion law. Excessive bail shall not be
</p>
<p>required,noroxcessivc fines imposed, norcruel and unusual
</p>
<p>punishments inflicted. No lawsliail be made or have force
</p>
<p>or elTect in said Territory which shall require a test oath or
</p>
<p>oaths to support any act of Congress or other legislative
</p>
<p>act as a qualification for any civil office or public trust, or
</p>
<p>for any employment or profession, or to serve as a juror, or
</p>
<p>vote at any election, or which shall impose any tax upon,

<p>or condition to, the ffxereise of the riglit of suffrage by any

</p>
<p>discussion of any law or subject of legislation in the said
</p>
<p>Territory, or tlie free expression of opiaion thereon by the
</p>
<p>people of said Territory."
</p>
<p>But this is only one among many of their acts
</p>
<p>of hypocrisy and deception. Not only did they
</p>
<p>refuse to take up this bill, with this clause re-
</p>
<p>pealing the " Draconian code," thus giving their
</p>
<p>official sanction to that code, but the false-hearted
</p>
<p>hypocrites actually voted to establish slavery

<p>IN THE Territory of Kansas  actually voted
</p>
<p>FOR the fugitive SLAVE LAW, wliich they have
</p>
<p>been abusing and denouncing, to the exhaustion

<p>of their Billingsgate terms, which are by no

<p>We beg our readers to contrast the two pro-
</p>
<p>visions. Read the one against which the Black
</p>
<p>Republicans voted alongside of the one for which
</p>
<p>they voted, which they voted through the House
</p>
<p>aeer the heads of every national Democrat in that body;
</p>
<p>then say who are the advocates of peace in Kan-
</p>
<p>sas  who the advocates of the *' Draconian laws. "
</p>
<p>But Mr. Leiter did not vote for the bill; and
</p>
<p>why did he bolt from his whole party ? He has
</p>
<p>answered that question for himself, and we give
</p>
<p>him the benefit of his reply. It is as follows:
</p>
<p>" We passed Dunn's bill for Kansas yesterday in a very
</p>
<p>ctojectionablo manner. It has many good provisions, biit
</p>
<p>extends the fui^itive slave law over Kuiisas and Nebraska, and
</p>
<p>perpetuates slavery there until 18.')8, and mahes all children
</p>
<p>horn therein up to that lime of slave iiiotlicrs slaves. This
</p>
<p>was too much for me.  I have always said, and now repeat
</p>
<p>my pledges, that I will never vote to rocoijnize slavery ; I
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>one single man whose rights or privileges, as
</p>
<p>a man and citizen, are disturbed, or threatened, or
</p>
<p>interfered with in any particular whatever, or
</p>
<p>in the remotest possible degree Wliatever. This
</p>
<p>is a truth  a fact  a demonstrable, unmistakable
</p>
<p>fact  a fact which cannot be gainsayed or dis-
</p>
<p>proved, or doubted; which no amount of Aboli-
</p>
<p>tion falsehood or imposture can distort or dis-
</p>
<p>guise a moment, when it is boldly and directly
</p>
<p>thrust down their lying throats. What, then, is
</p>
<p>the cause or pretense of the trouble in Kansas,
</p>
<p>where no man's rights are outraged, where, as
</p>
<p>an American citizen and freeman, he enjoys all
</p>
<p>the rights of citizenship, all the Constitution
</p>
<p>secures to him, all, in fact that nature and the
</p>
<p>Almighty himself have given him? What, we
</p>
<p>repeat, is the excuse or pretense for civil war in
</p>
<p>Kansas? What impels men to shed the blood of
</p>
<p>their brethren, or to risk their own lives  to raise
</p>
<p>their parricidal hands against their country  to
</p>
<p>disgrace their own Government, when not one
</p>
<p>single right or privilege of citizenship is threat-
</p>
<p>ened or interfered with in the remotest manner?
</p>
<p>Well, there is a cause of pretense after all, and
</p>
<p>though reason and common sense would never
</p>
<p>even dream of such a thing  though patriotism
</p>
<p>and the spirit of democracy would instantaneously
</p>
<p>shrink from such a pretense  though nature and
</p>
<p>the instincts of manhood should revolt with irre-
</p>
<p>pressible and overwhelming disgust from such a
</p>
<p>cause or excuse  nevertheless it exists, and it is
</p>
<p>" nigger freedom !"

<p>and with it the destruction of democratic institu-
</p>
<p>tions, long since turned their attention to, and
</p>
<p>li^ed their hopes on, the negro element in our
</p>
<p>midst. Their writers were set to work to prop-
</p>
<p>agate the notion that the negro was a man like
</p>
<p>ourselves, except in his color, and consequently j
</p>
<p>that the social subordination of the negro was
</p>
<p>slavery, immoral and monstrous; and British
</p>
<p>statesmen brought the vast power of their Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment  indeed, the whole- combined power of
</p>
<p>European monarchism  to carry out the theories
</p>
<p>of their writers, and force the whites, Indians,
</p>
<p>and negroes of this continent to a common level.
</p>
<p>Except Cuba, they have destroyed, neccssarilti
</p>
<p>destroyed, the civilization of the whole of tropical
</p>
<p>Arnerica, which their policy contemplates as the
</p>
<p>future of avast negro barbarism, to be wielded
</p>
<p>when the time comes for the fuin of south<;rn
</p>
<p> society, and the consequent destruction of Amer-
</p>
<p>ican democracy; all, however, disguised under
</p>
<p>the pretense of " philanthropy," and termed the
</p>
<p>*' abdlition of slavery." But while devoting so
</p>
<p>much time and money to this devil's work in the
</p>
<p>tropics, they did not neglect other means essen-
</p>
<p>tial to final success, and British agents and tools
</p>
<p>have been at work for twenty years in forming a
</p>
<p>party in our midst that would cooperate with
</p>
<p>them in their infamous designs against the Amer-
</p>
<p>ican Union, or, as their dupes and tools say, that
</p>
<p>would assist them in the "abolition of slavery."
</p>
<p>Wc do not mean to charge Colonel Fremont,
</p>
<p>or the great body of his supporters, with unfaith-
</p>
<p>fulness to our institutions. JIc has given the best
</p>
<p>possible evidence of patriotism and love of coun-

<p>try that a man can give; and no one has a right

<p>9
</p>
<p>aroused to a consciousness of the danger which
</p>
<p>is almost upon us; yet there are many who meet
</p>
<p>aJl apfieals to their patriotism, all exhortations to
</p>
<p>their vigilance, with the constant cry of Peace!
</p>
<p>Peace! when each day and hour brings new
</p>
<p>proof that there is no peace; that unless the peo-
</p>
<p>ple rise up in their might and majesty to drive
</p>
<p>back the tide of fanaucism and disunion  to
</p>
<p>scourge it from out tlrc borders of our land there
</p>
<p>can never more be peace.
</p>
<p>Let it not be a reason and a reliance that, be-
</p>
<p>cause we have escaped more than once, when
</p>
<p>Uie wisest of our statesmen and the sternest of
</p>
<p>our patriots believed we were on the verge of a
</p>
<p>dissolution, that we shall escape now. Those
</p>
<p>who would thus delude themselves should remem-
</p>
<p>ber that we were saved then only by the might- '
</p>
<p>iest efforts of those great and good men. They '
</p>
<p>should likewise remember that one by one these '
</p>
<p>giant patriots have paid the great debt of nature, |
</p>
<p>until scarce one is left to raise a protecting arm !
</p>
<p>ai-ound the Constitution; and, more than all, they '
</p>
<p>should remember that the few who remain of that !
</p>
<p>venerable band, with sad foreboding and earnest
</p>
<p>supplications, are warning their countrymen of
</p>
<p>the fate which must inevitably come upon our
</p>
<p>Union, unless the people arouse themselves to its
</p>
<p>defense.
</p>
<p>Let 'our old men turn back their recollections to
</p>
<p>early times, when a dissolution of the Union was
</p>
<p>first agitated, and when it was considered trea-
</p>
<p>son. The danger and the crime were so revolt-
</p>
<p>ing that the instigators spoke of it in whispers,
</p>
<p>juid scarcely dared to trust their own thoughts.

</p>
<p>Let them look back to the war of 1812, when
</p>
<p>political and sectional intolerance essayed its dis-
</p>
<p>loyalty to the Union, and how sternly it was
</p>
<p>rebuked by the insulted majesty of the people.
</p>
<p>Let them remember when the subject of disunion
</p>
<p>first invaded the Halls of Congress as a debatable i
</p>
<p>idea, and how like treason it was treated. Let'
</p>
<p>them trace how insidiously it gained a foothold !
</p>
<p>as a political element, and emboldened partisans
</p>
<p>to repudiute the idea that crime attached to it. '
</p>
<p>Let tliem see how far we have departed from the
</p>
<p>virtue and patriotism of our fathers, by turnino-
</p>
<p>away from their pure example like procligal sons^.
</p>
<p>Let them see how rank the growth of treason is
</p>
<p>throughout the land, and the boldness with which
</p>
<p>that name is blotted out, and its principles claimed
</p>
<p>and practiced as virtues. Let not the people shut
</p>
<p>Uieir eyes to the fact that a great sectional party is
</p>
<p>struggling for the Presidency, and using every
</p>
<p>measure that can provoke sectional prejudices,
</p>
<p>aad endanger the integrity of the Union. Let
</p>
<p>them not blink the fact, that this party avows
</p>
<p>that it IS better that the " Union should slide "
</p>
<p>than that their distinctive principles should not
</p>
<p>triumph. Let them not forget that it has struck
</p>
<p>from our national banner fifteen of its glorious
</p>
<p>and consecrated stars. Let them look to the rev-
</p>
<p>olutionary and disorganizing course of this party
</p>
<p>during the last regular session of Congress, and
</p>
<p>the called session. Let them mark how perse-
</p>
<p>veringly they nrovoko civil war, and make it a I
</p>
<p>stalking-horse 'over fields of blood, in pursuit of i
</p>
<p>party power.
</p>
<p>When we contemplate all these overt acts or
</p>
<p>disloyalty to the Union, how can any unpreju- i

</p>
<p>and to proclaim its early dissolution. To add to
</p>
<p>t'iis, their favorite young leader, Mr. Banks,
</p>
<p>be^an the campaign with a very significant an-
</p>
<p>nouAcement in the imperative mood  " Let the
</p>
<p>Union slide." He now holds the highest office
</p>
<p>which, since that time, has been within their gift.
</p>
<p>His power with them, from that hour, has never
</p>
<p>lessened, bat has been increased, and at this
</p>
<p>moment he iv' the iriaster spirit of their combi,-
</p>
<p>nation.
</p>
<p>Between him and the other young and ardent
</p>
<p>Catilines of their secret councils, and between '
</p>
<p>them and an old ad arch-lraitor from the Dem- ;
</p>
<p>ocratic ranks, who once edited its organ, the
</p>
<p>project was conceived of planning & sectional
</p>
<p>party which should not be offended by the intro-
</p>
<p>duction of a single national element. By being
</p>
<p>made exclusive, it was believed that it would be
</p>
<p>of easier control, and would be susceptible of a
</p>
<p>more intense excitement and concentration. The
</p>
<p>plot once matured, tliey looked out for some wild, I
</p>
<p>reckless, and daring adventurer, around whom I
</p>
<p>there might be just mystery enough to inflame |
</p>
<p>curiosity, and a notoriety sufficient to have made
</p>
<p>his name familiar. It was r.ot material to them
</p>
<p>whether he should be the equal of iNIungo Park,
</p>
<p>or that he should have the profound philosophy !
</p>
<p>of Humboldt. It would be enou^'h that they !
</p>
<p>could swear him to be the rival of both, and I
</p>
<p>as having some graces for speculation, cither in
</p>
<p>politics, religion, morals, or finance, of which
</p>
<p>ihey could not clann an equal knowledge and as
</p>
<p>high a reputation. But in him must be found at j
</p>
<p>least one single feature, which should be like and '

<p>peculiar to their sworn affiliation. The machia-
</p>
<p>vselian teacher in politics, who deserted the Dem- 1
</p>
<p>ocrats because they would no longer patronize him, |
</p>
<p>and whose experience and dexterity fitted him for I
</p>
<p>the task of a prime coutiselor, might supply the j
</p>
<p>ways and means for that. The pupil was, there- [
</p>
<p>fore, early advised of the importance of being put
</p>
<p>into communication with the rebellious and dis-
</p>
<p>organizing spirits of Kansas; and beUeving him- 1
</p>
<p>self to be a hopeful aspirant for becoming a Chief j
</p>
<p>^Magistrate, he soon found occasion to express
</p>
<p>in a formal letter to the bogus Governor Robin- 1
</p>
<p>son, of Kansas, his deep sympathies for the work ;
</p>
<p>of abolition and disunion, which was then pro-
</p>
<p>gressing in that ill-fated Territory, under the
</p>
<p>Christian and generous auspices of the Emigrant
</p>
<p>Aid Society of Massachusetts. Such was the
</p>
<p>process of preparation, and John C. Fremont
</p>
<p>becaiTie a fit candidate for the Black Republican
</p>
<p>nomination. In sketching this brief notice of the
</p>
<p>preparation which that party was making to
</p>
<p>wiold, if possible, successfully, the knife against
</p>
<p>a brother, and for using the torch to destroy a
</p>
<p>neighbor, we must not forget the episode which
</p>
<p>was enacted in the progress of the scene. The
</p>
<p>name of John McLean, a justice of the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court of the United States, was brought forward
</p>
<p>by some personal friends for the favor and con-
</p>
<p>jidcnce of the Black Republicans. But, unhap-
</p>
<p>pily, the letter which he wrote scaled his fate, in
</p>
<p>that he expressed his devotion to the Union, and
</p>
<p>intimated something which seemed to be intended
</p>
<p>tq moan that a just administration of the affairs
</p>
<p>of the Government should be carefully guarded.
</p>
<p>His doom was fixed. His name, if not actually
</p>
<p>11
</p>
<p>surrounded; and, knowing it, we feel it our duty
</p>
<p>to declare it, to warn our countrymen, to appeal
</p>
<p>to ttiem as men, as brothers, and as patriots; and
</p>
<p>if our brethren of the North are true to their own
</p>
<p>interests, to the affections of their hearts, to the
</p>
<p>ties which bind them to country and to kindred,
</p>
<p>with one great effort they will hurl to the dust
</p>
<p>the conspirators who now, with their ambitious
</p>
<p>projects, threaten the dissolution of this Union.

</p>
<p>The Democratic Position.
</p>
<p>There never was a Presidential canvass where
</p>
<p>the Democratic position was so distinct and pos-
</p>
<p>\trve as at the present time, and yet, strange
</p>
<p>enough, there never has been a canvass where
</p>
<p>the real issue involved was so misrepresented and
</p>
<p>so misunderstood. The position is non-inteiTen-
</p>
<p>tion  that Congress shall not intervene or meddle
</p>
<p>with so-called sla%'ery. That is all exactly all
</p>
<p> the whole question, and it would seem so plain,
</p>
<p>and so reasonable, and so just to " North" and
</p>
<p>" South," and all classes and conditions of our
</p>
<p>people, that not one single citizen should be or
</p>
<p>would be opposed to it.
</p>
<p>The Democratic idea necessarily leads to this
</p>
<p>position. Democracy is equality  not a forced
</p>
<p>or factitious equality, or an equality brought
</p>
<p>about by legal enactments, or that assumes to
</p>
<p>compel the wise and foolish, the moral and im-
</p>
<p>moral, the good and the bad, to stand together on
</p>
<p>a common level, but that leaves all men perfectly
</p>
<p>free to ascend or to descend in the social scale
</p>
<p>just as they please, or just as their industry, cul-
</p>
<p>tivation, moral worth, or usefulness to their fel-

<p>lows merit. It assumes that all men are naturally
</p>
<p>equal, and therefore entitled to equal rights as
</p>
<p>well as equally responsible for the due perform-
</p>
<p>ance of common duties; and with unbounded
</p>
<p>confidence in the intelligence and virtue of the
</p>
<p>people, the Democratic party holds tkat govern-
</p>
<p>ment the best which governs the least. Or, in other
</p>
<p>words, it trusts to the individual man rather than
</p>
<p>the machine called the Government, and always
</p>
<p>labors to enlarge the sphere of action to the
</p>
<p>former, and to circumscribe it in the case of the
</p>
<p>latter. Thus, from the beginning of the national
</p>
<p>existence, or from the day of its organization,
</p>
<p>the Democracy have labored to reform and sim-
</p>
<p>plify the machinery of government in the 'States,
</p>
<p>and in respect to national politics, have strictly
</p>
<p>eonstrued the Federal Constitution and confined
</p>
<p>the Federal power to the few objects designed by
</p>
<p>its founders. That the Federal Government has
</p>
<p>no right whatever to legislate on the subject of
</p>
<p>so-called slavery in the national Territories, ex-
</p>
<p>cept to protect the rights of property that may
</p>
<p>attach or be involved in that subject, would seem
</p>
<p>to be so self-evident and unmistakable, that no
</p>
<p>one would have the folly or the audacity to dis-
</p>
<p>pute it, nor indeed would any one assume such
</p>
<p>an absurd position, if it were not for the wide-
</p>
<p>spread ignorance and misconception which pre-
</p>
<p>vail.
</p>
<p>The Constitution defines, with perfect exact-
</p>
<p>ness, the extent of the Federal power in respect
</p>
<p>to " slavery." It provides for the indirect rep-
</p>
<p>resentation of the negro, or ' slave" population,
</p>
<p>and the restoration of " fugacious" or abscond-
</p>
<p>ing "slaves." That is all; and in everything
</p>
<p>12
</p>
<p>erel Government within its well-defined limits 
</p>
<p>to keep it from interfering with the subject of
</p>
<p>" slavery"  in short, to prevent those who op-
</p>
<p>posed the acquisition of the Territories from
</p>
<p>excluding any portion of the people who may
</p>
<p>desire to settle in tliem. That is the position of
</p>
<p>the Democratic party  a position of simple non-
</p>
<p>intervention  and it would seem so plain and un-
</p>
<p>mistakable, that no one would have the hardihood
</p>
<p>to deny it, or the folly to try to controvert it.
</p>
<p>But back of all this is another question, or
</p>
<p>rather another difficulty. It is admitted at the
</p>
<p>North that so-called " slavery," or the social re-
</p>
<p>lations of southern society, is wrong, immoral,
</p>
<p>unnatural  in short, slavery; and thus the whole
</p>
<p>question is given up at the start, and the vile
</p>
<p>creatures who, consciously or unconsciously, are
</p>
<p>doing the work of British aristocrats and Euro-
</p>
<p>pean monarchists, the Giddings, Sumners, Hales,
</p>
<p>&c., and assume to exclude the " South" frorTi
</p>
<p>Kansas, appear to the northern people honest and
</p>
<p>patriotic citizens, who desire to save the Terri-
</p>
<p>tories from an admitted evil. If the vail that now
</p>
<p>blinds the North were lifted, and the people could
</p>
<p>see this thing as it really is, or if means were
</p>
<p>taken to enlighten the northern mind on the sub-
</p>
<p>ject of " slavery >" the Burlingames and Greeleys
</p>
<p>would be lyncned by the very crowds that now
</p>
<p>so clamorously cheer them as patriots and
</p>
<p>" friends of freedom." And whatever the imme-
</p>
<p>diate resultof the present misconception and de-
</p>
<p>lusion of the North, the time will come when not
</p>
<p>one single man within its broad limits will ac-
</p>
<p>knowledge himself such a fool, or such a knave,

<p>democracy, as to assume to exclude any portion

<p>Black Republican Convention.
</p>
<p>The following are some of the sentiments of
</p>
<p>tlte members of the Black Republican Abolition
</p>
<p>Convention that nominated Fremont:
</p>
<p>JOHN p. HALE
</p>
<p>was there, the Abolition carfdidate for President
</p>
<p>against Scott and Pierce, in 1852. What is his
</p>
<p>record? On the 7th of February, 1850, he pre-
</p>
<p>sented, insisted upon, and, along with Chase
</p>
<p>and Seward alone, voted to receive, refer, and
</p>
<p>consider a petition demanding of Congress " an
</p>
<p>immediate dissolution of the Union," because a
</p>
<p>union with slaveholders is violative of divine law
</p>
<p>and human rights. On the 23d of March, 1848,
</p>
<p>he presented a batch of eighty petitions at once,
</p>
<p>demanding the same thing.
</p>
<p>SALMO>f p. CHASE.
</p>
<p>vras there by letter, and originally a candidate 
</p>
<p>afterwards a zealous supporter of Fremont for
</p>
<p>nomination. For his record, let the columns of
</p>
<p>tlie Dayton Journal, last fall, answer. He is an
</p>
<p>original old-line Abolitionist, in favor of negro suf-
</p>
<p>frage and negro equality; opposed to constitutional
</p>
<p>provisions for the rendition of fugitive slaves; in
</p>
<p>' favor of excluding ail slaveholders from office;
</p>
<p>believes that slavery in the Stales would not con-

<p>The old Abolitionists, who, twenty-five years
</p>
<p>ago, were unable to utter their disunion senti-
</p>
<p>ments, even in Boston, without endangering
</p>
<p>theirnecks, as did Garrison when he was dragged
</p>
<p>from Faneuil Hall, with his neck haltered, are
</p>
<p>liie sub-soil or back-bone of this party which
</p>
<p>supports Fremont. But they manage to keep a
</p>
<p>little ahead, and avow their purposes rather more
</p>
<p>boldly than do the political demagogues and the
</p>
<p>masses they lead, and whom their treasonable
</p>
<p>and fanatical sentiments have aroused to their
</p>
<p>present alarming position. Hear what Wendell
</p>
<p>Phillips, one of their number, said in his remarks
</p>
<p>on the 4th of July, 1856:
</p>
<p>" No man, Mr. Chairman, has a right to be
</p>
<p>surprised at the present state of things. It is
</p>
<p>just what we have attempted to bring about; my
</p>
<p>friend Swasy was telling us this morning what
</p>
<p>slavery has done. She has stolen Texas, crushed
</p>
<p>Kansas, usurped the Government, left the presi-
</p>
<p>dential chair empty. What has she done .' She
</p>
<p>has done just exactly what ire have been tempting her
</p>
<p>to do  that is, she has developed herself. The
</p>
<p>.slave power had always the same power, and the
</p>
<p>same wish; it is the anti-slavcnj enterprise that has
</p>
<p>developed that xvish into an act. It is just ichat we
</p>
<p>expected, exactly. The forces, at last, are ranged
</p>
<p>face to face. Our friends have not turned to the
</p>
<p>bright side of the matter to-day; but there is merit

</p>
<p>and that northern men have fallen; and then will
</p>
<p>soon follow the gratifying intelligence that the

<p>northern States have arrayed themselves against
</p>
<p>the Federal Government in Kansas. And will

<p>ABOLITION PREDICTIONS.
</p>
<p>"Among the many predictions which they
</p>
<p>have uttered, or rather the many statements they
</p>
<p>have made, as to what must come to pass, the
</p>
<p>one which five or six years ago seemed the wild- 1
</p>
<p>est, was the necessary division of the nation '
</p>
<p>into two parts the northern and the southern I
</p>
<p>of which the principles should be slavery and
</p>
<p>anti-slavery. Five years ago, what seemed more
</p>
<p>unlikely than that the nation should be divided I
</p>
<p>into strictly sectional parties as it is now .? But i
</p>
<p>the lines are now drawn and the hosts are en-
</p>
<p>camped over against each other. The attempt
</p>
<p>to keep up a delusive alliance with natural ene-
</p>
<p>mies has been abandoned. The Abolitionists have
</p>
<p>been telling these things in the ears of the peo-
</p>
<p>ple for a quarter of a century. They have had
</p>
<p>a double part in what has come to pass, both by
</p>
<p>preparing the minds of the people of the, North,
</p>
<p>and by compelling the people of the South to the
</p>
<p>very atrocities which have startled the North into

<p>fall, on the part of the slaveholders, could have
</p>
<p>roused the sluggish North from its comfortable
</p>
<p>dreams of wealth, and made it put itself into a
</p>
<p>position of resistance. The North is in a state
</p>

</p>
<p>the time, and the widening lines of division be-
</p>
<p>tween the North and the South are growing deep
</p>
<p>and distinct. It is long since this paper took the
</p>
<p>ground that the first thing, though by no means
</p>
<p>tlie only thing needful, was the formation of sec- \
</p>
<p>tional parties of parties distinctly northern and
</p>
<p>southern, and, of necessity, slavery and anti-sla-
</p>
<p>very. We rejoice that our eyes behold the day
</p>
<p>of that beginning of the end. The position is
</p>
<p>everything. It is the attitude that is expressive
</p>
<p>and encouraging. It is the entire separation of
</p>
<p>the party from all southern alliance, and from all
</p>
<p>possibility of slaveholding help, that gives' it its
</p>
<p>encouraging aspect, and makes it, with all its

<p>Is Uie Black RepubUcan Party Sectional?
</p>
<p>Extract of a speech of Hon. George W. Julian,
</p>
<p>of Indiana, at a Fremont meeting at Greenville,
</p>
<p>Darke county, Ohio, Wednesday evening, Sep-
</p>
<p>tember 10, 1856:
</p>
<p>" It is no use to deny it any longer, our Republican party
</p>
<p>is a sectional party, because the South has forced us into
</p>
<p>it. Tlie stampers of this old-line, horse-stealing Democ-
</p>
<p>racy, not having the fear of God before their eyes, charge
</p>
<p>as with being sectional. / tell you we are a sectional party.
</p>
<p>It is not alone a tiglit between the North and the South, h
</p>
<p>is a fight between freedom and slavery between Goj and
</p>
<p>the Devil between heaven and hell." [Loud applause.]
</p>
<p>The Hon. George W. Julian, who made the
</p>
<p>above frank admission, is one of the most distin-
</p>
<p>guished and prominent Black Republicans in the
</p>
<p>United States. He was the candidate of the Abo-
</p>
<p>litionists for Vice President, with John P. Hale
</p>
<p>for President, in 1852, and is now the principal
</p>
<p>Fremont orator in Indiana. His testimony, there-
</p>
<p>fore, is not likely to be gainsayed or repudiated by
</p>
<p>his own partisans, some of whom have hitherto
</p>
<p>denied, in the face of the most overwhelming and
</p>
<p>patent proof of its truth, that the Fremont Abo-
</p>
<p>lition organization was sectional. Yes, they have
</p>
<p>denied it, although their party has no existence
</p>
<p>south of a geogttophical line; although in their
</p>
<p>noRiinating convention only one (the northern) i
</p>
<p>section of the Confederacy was represented; and
</p>
<p>although their platform tenders a sectional issue
</p>
<p>upon sectional grounds. They have denied it,
</p>
<p>although their political appeals are all made to
</p>
<p>the North, and are filled with the most bitter and
</p>
<p>scurrilous attacks upon, the South, to awaken a
</p>
<p>prejudice against which their principal element i
</p>
<p>16
</p>
<p>is the while man''s equal and entitled to the same political
</p>
<p>and social privileges."
</p>
<p>It will be seen by this that the Black Republi-
</p>
<p>cans advocate not' only the political equality of
</p>
<p>the negro with the white man, but also the social
</p>
<p>equality !
</p>
<p>Tlie (Question of Superiority Settled.
</p>
<p>It would appear, by the following paragraph
</p>
<p>from the Martinsville Monitor, that the Black
</p>
<p>Republicans of Indiana have settled in their minds
</p>
<p>the question as to the relative superiority of the
</p>
<p>black and white races, which, after long study,
</p>
<p>Mr. Union-sliding Banks was unable to decide
</p>
<p>upon. The incident related occurred at a Fre-
</p>
<p>mont barbecue in Morgan county:
</p>
<p>" The most chanictfristic part of the whole aftair oc-
</p>
<p>(nirred at the table. A mechanic, who had hitherto heen a
</p>
<p>Btrong Fr^mcint man, was on the ground with his wife and
</p>
<p>child. At a given word, he attempted to cross the rope to !
</p>
<p>the tal)le, hut was met by one of the marshals, and told to
</p>
<p>stand back and give room for the ladies. He stepped back, '
</p>
<p>as he was told, when seven or eight women, ' as black as
</p>
<p>THE ACE OF spades,' advanced before him to the table, and '
</p>
<p>ate with the rest of the Fremont ladies and gentlemen.
</p>
<p>This was too much for him. lie tore the Fremont badge j
</p>
<p>from his breast, and swore that although he was a poor j
</p>
<p>mechanic, he was yet a little better than a negro. He said t
</p>
<p>that if he and his wife were to bo thrust back from a Fre-
</p>
<p>mont barbecue, to give place to negroes, he no longer was I
</p>
<p>a Fremont man, and immediately stamped the Fremont j
</p>
<p>badge-under his feet, and declared his intention to vote for !
</p>
<p>Buchanan. We are informed that four or five others did j
</p>
<p>likewise. It is said that not less than twenty negroes ate i
</p>
<p>at tiic first table." I

<p>Coal-Black Republicans.
</p>
<p>The " colored Republicans" held a mass meet-
</p>
<p>ing in Warren county, Ohio, on the 19th ultimo,
</p>
<p>and in 'the procession formed on the occasion i
</p>
<p>there were three hundred negroes !

</p>
<p>The I'olitical Fritsts!
</p>
<p>Every city, and almost every large town, in
</p>
<p>New England , has its political priests. They are
</p>
<p>men who love distinction, and who cannot obtain
</p>
<p>it by preaching the Gospel. So they join hands
</p>
<p>with infidels and spiritualists, and feed their flocks
</p>
<p>with denunciations of Democracy, and abuse of
</p>
<p>the Government, to which they are indebted,
</p>
<p>more than to their own good behavior, for pro-
</p>
<p>tection. With remarkable unanimity they are
</p>
<p>fighting men. They want to see civil war, and
</p>
<p>are therafore loud in their praises of Sharpe's
</p>
<p>rifles and bowie-knives. We will give specimens
</p>
<p>of the religion of this class of them.
</p>
<p>In the Pittsburg convention, afew months ago,
</p>
<p>the Rev. Mr. Brewster said:
</p>
<p>" He, for one, was in favor of using fire-arms, and fighting
</p>
<p>for freedom in Kansas."
</p>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Chandler said:
</p>
<p>" He believed that Sharpe's rifles were the best peace-
</p>
<p>makers ; there was no danger too many of them would be
</p>
<p>introduced into Kansas."
</p>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Lovejoy said:
</p>
<p><' He was willing to go cilhrr as a captain or private. He
</p>
<p>would use yiuirpo's rifles, awAfire with good aim."
</p>
<p>In the North Church, soon after, the Rev.
</p>
<p>Henry Ward Beecher said:
</p>
<p>" I hold it to he an everlasting disgrace to shoot at a man
</p>
<p>and not hit Rim .'"'
</p>
<p>17
</p>
<p>This will show that political preaching is noth- '
</p>
<p>ing new. And we may add, that it is nothing to ,
</p>
<p>be" frightened at. The American Union and the I
</p>
<p>Democratic party have survived it, and will sur- !
</p>
<p>vive it, while there is a spark of patriotism in tiie ^
</p>
<p>breasts of the American people. But of political \
</p>
<p>E reaching and political preachers, how can we j
</p>
<p>etter speak than in the language of that greatest
</p>
<p>of English statesmen and modern philosophers, j
</p>
<p>Edmund Burke } The following are his words: 
</p>
<p>" Politics and tlie pulpit are terms that have little agree- j
</p>
<p>meat. No sound ought to he heard in the churcli but the
</p>
<p>voice of healini; charity. The cause of civil liberty and [
</p>
<p>civil government gains as little as that of religion by the l
</p>
<p>. confusion of duties. Those wluxiuit their proper character |
</p>
<p>to assume what does not belong to them, are, for the greater j
</p>
<p>part, ignorant both of the character they leave and the :
</p>
<p>character they assume.. AVholly unacquainted with the [
</p>
<p>world, in which they are so fond of meddling, and inexperi-
</p>
<p>enced in all its alfairs, on which they pronounce with so
</p>
<p>much contidence, tliey know nothing of polities but the
</p>
<p>passion they excite. Surely the church is a place where
</p>
<p>one day's truce ought to be allowed to the dissensions and
</p>
<p>animosities of mankind."

<p>following is the copy of a circular sent by the

<p>to get up special collections for the purpose of
</p>
<p>prosecuting the sectional crusade now going on
</p>
<p>against our beleaguered Constitution. This is
</p>
<p>a pretty business, truly, for the "American Mis-

</p>
<p>pretty business for the churches of the land to
</p>
<p>be engaged in. How ifiournfuliy shameful, that
</p>
<p>everything hallowed, sacred, and of good report,
</p>
<p>in Church and State, should thus be prostituted
</p>
<p>and dragged through the dung-heap of sectional
</p>
<p>Abolitionism, and all to elevate a set of men,
</p>
<p>and inaugurate a set of principles that milst end

<p>in the destruction of a righteous Church and a

<p>well-ordered and prosperous State!

</p>
<p>Einely until they hear the cry, " The Philistines

<p>e upon thee !" It will then be too late. They
</p>
<p>must be met before their plans are matured. It
</p>
<p>will readily occur to the mind of the reader, that
</p>
<p>a very large sum could be, and doul)tless has
</p>
<p>been, rau^-d to carry on this fearful crusacfe.
</p>
<p>Nothiing can be more plain than the fact that this
</p>
<p>money is collected through the agency of the
</p>
<p>Missionary Society to swell the Fremont Re-|

</p>
<p>earnestly, steadfastly, and successfully opposed I
</p>
<p>the efforts of bigots and proscriptionists toestab- !
</p>
<p>lish tests wholly foreign to the spirit of our peo- 1

<p>question the right of Colonel Fremont to place ',

<p>himself in communion with either the Catholic I

<p>"Mr. B. F. Cook made some interesting and

<p>important statements respecting an interview he '

<p>had with Colonel Fremont on the subject of his
</p>
<p>alleged Romanism. It was in substance this:
</p>
<p>Some friends having desired to enlist the speaker
</p>
<p>in the cause of so-called republicanism, he ex- ,
</p>
<p>pressed a desire to have all doubts removedon i
</p>
<p>this mooted question, hut said that nothing short \

</p>
<p>would satisfy him. An interview was arranged
</p>
<p>for. The object of the' visit being understood by
</p>
<p>the Colonel, he avowed himself ready to answer
</p>
<p>any question proposed. Mr. Cook proposed the
</p>
<p>following, and received to each the answer an-
</p>
<p>nexed: 'Were you married by a Roman Cath-
</p>
<p>olic priest?' ' I toas'  the Colonel's lip quiver- 1
</p>
<p>ingas he spoke. Did you at the time believe
</p>
<p>in, or profess to believe in, the Roman Cath-
</p>
<p>olic religion 'f' ' I did not. ' * Have you before or
</p>
<p>since, or at any time, pi-ofessed the Catholic reli-
</p>
<p>gion?' 'I have not.' Here Mr. Cook bowed to
</p>
<p>signify that he had no more questions to ask. i
</p>
<p>Colonel Fremont then volunteered some remarks
</p>
<p>to the following eflect: That while in California
</p>
<p>he attended no church; and that he occupied his
</p>
<p>Sundays in reading and writing, and in attending
</p>
<p>to such matters of business as he thought of im-
</p>
<p>porlance. Mr. Fremont further said: "' I am fre-
</p>
<p>quently interrogated by all parties on this sub- '
</p>
<p>ject. I presume the delegation now waiting for
</p>
<p>me up stairs wish to interrogate me on this point.
</p>
<p>When they do, I shall put the most favorable
</p>
<p>construction on the matter that I can. I wish to
</p>
<p>offertd none, but to secure the votes of all. Only
</p>
<p>this very morning, I have a letter from Maine,
</p>
<p>Baying that unless I make a personal denial of
</p>
<p>Romanism , and that if I am or have been a Roman
</p>
<p>Catholic, that State will be lost to the Republic-
</p>
<p>ans; and another letter from Indiana, telling jne
</p>
<p>that if I will authorize my friends there to say
</p>
<p>I am a Roman Catholic, they can secure me a
</p>
<p>large German and Irish vote. I have to frame'
</p>
<p>my replies so as to secure the votes of all. There
</p>
<p>is now a deiiulation waiting for me, whose errand
</p>
<p>19
</p>
<p>another line of defense. It attempts to discredit
</p>
<p>Mr. Cook's statement by the unsupported con-
</p>
<p>tradiction of unnamed witnesses, and boldly de-
</p>
<p>dares that, unless the statement takes the form
</p>
<p>of an affidavit, it will excite no other feeling in
</p>
<p>the public mind than that of contempt and dis- ;
</p>
<p>belief. 1
</p>
<p>Contrary to the expectations, and certainly
</p>
<p>contrary to the wishes of the Courier, J\Ir. Cook
</p>
<p>has made the callcd-f or affidavit. It is plain, ex-
</p>
<p>plicit, and is apparently free from that spirit of j
</p>
<p>eixaggeration which is apt to influence too many j
</p>
<p>who assume the office jnd responsibilities of a ;
</p>
<p>narrator. |
</p>
<p>The affidavit starts out with the substance of
</p>
<p>a conversation which took place between Mr. ;
</p>
<p>Cook and a Mr. Potter a few weeks ago. Mr.
</p>
<p>Cook likes Mr. Fremont very well in the main,
</p>
<p>and would vote for him if he was satisfied that
</p>
<p>he was not a Catholic. His friend Potter as- 1
</p>
<p>Bures him that Fremont is not a Catholic, and to \
</p>
<p>convince him of the con-ectness of his assurance,
</p>
<p>agrees to take him (Cook) to Fremont's house,
</p>
<p>where he can be satisfied byword of mouth, and
</p>
<p>without the intervention of a second party. The !
</p>
<p>two start for the residence of Mr. Fremont, and j
</p>
<p>not the least interesting part of the affidavit is the i
</p>
<p>detailed account of the trials and disappointments
</p>
<p>to which both were subjected before they were i
</p>
<p>finally admitted to an audience with the Black
</p>
<p>Republican candidate for the Presidency. For :
</p>
<p>the benefit of those who contemplate a pilgrim-

<p>the affidavit  that the "second Washington"
</p>
<p>has given orders to his servants to assure all
</p>
<p>common visitors that " he is out of town, and
</p>
<p>will not return for three weeks," although he
</p>
<p>has been for some time, and is now, in the com-
</p>
<p>fortable occupancy of his elegantly-furnished
</p>
<p>mansion in the street and city already desig-
</p>
<p>nated.
</p>
<p>We pass over Mr. Cook's amusing adventures
</p>
<p>in search of Fremont and the truth, and come to
</p>
<p>the pith of the affidavit. Mr. Cook puts the
</p>
<p>question plainly and directly to Mr. Fremont in
</p>
<p>regard to his religious belief. Mr. Fremont's re-
</p>
<p>ply, as sworn to by Mr. Cook, was as follows:
</p>
<p>" In reference to my marriage, all that I can say
</p>
<p>is, that 1 have taken little interest in the tenets of
</p>
<p>that Church, and know but little about them. But
</p>
<p>myself and wife were married by a Catholic; and
</p>
<p>I believe that there are many instances where
</p>
<p>Protestants have been married by Catholic cler-
</p>
<p>gymen."
</p>
<p>" [He here mentioned a case, but I do not
</p>
<p>remember the names.]
</p>
<p>" Jn regard to my being a Catholic while in
</p>
<p>Ciifornia, I can say that, while there, I. labored
</p>
<p>excessively hard, and when Sunday came I was
</p>
<p>very much fatigued, and did not feel like going
</p>
<p>to church, although my wife did, when it was
</p>
<p>convenient. But I generally stayed at home, and
</p>
<p>spent my time in reading, writing, and attending
</p>
<p>to such matters of business as I considered of
</p>
<p>importance; and to my knowledge I was never
</p>
<p>i'nside of any church while in Cahfornia.
</p>
<p>'* He then said: ' I am often asked about my
</p>
<p>being a Catholic by all parties, and even by Cath-
</p>
<p>20
</p>
<p>added: "Colonel Fremont won't deny that he
</p>
<p>was a Catholic; everybody there so underwood
</p>
<p>it, and he made no secret of it."
</p>
<p> Further conversation occurred between us on
</p>
<p>the subject, but this is the sum and substance of
</p>
<p>it. I asked him if I might refer to this conversa-
</p>
<p>tion, and use his name. He replied " certainly,
</p>
<p>you are at liberty to do so." But he again said,
</p>
<p>" Colonel Fremont will not deny that he was a
</p>
<p>Catholic."
</p>
<p>Colonel Russell, you may not be aware, was
</p>
<p>Colonel Fremont's principal witndfes on his trial
</p>
<p>before the court-martial.*^ Should Colonel Fre-
</p>
<p>mont deny, over his own signature, that he was
</p>
<p>a Catholic when in California, I presume Colonel
</p>
<p>Russell will then speak for himself.
</p>
<p>Colonel Russell is an old, ardent, personal , friend
</p>
<p>of Henry Clay, with whose family his own is
</p>
<p>connected, his daughter having married Mr.
</p>
<p>Clay's grandson. |

<p>Political partisans occasionally prefer charges

<p>rence between Messrs Brooks and Sumner to
</p>
<p>political account, on the untenable ground that
</p>
<p>the Democratic party is responsible for the acts
</p>
<p>of one who goes with them politically. If such
</p>
<p>a position were maint^nable, all poliiical parties
</p>
<p>might be crushed on account of the unjustifiable
</p>
<p>acts of individuals in their respective ranks. On
</p>
<p>the other hand, parties are justly and properly
</p>
<p>held responsible for their selection of candidates
</p>
<p>for high political positions for whom they solicit
</p>
<p>votes. Let us apply these principles: Mr. Sum-
</p>
<p>ner, in a speech delivered in the Senate, applied
</p>
<p>epithets of disparagement and severity to the
</p>
<p>State of South Carolina and Senator Butler, when
</p>
<p>he was absent. Mr. Brooks, of the House, a
</p>
<p>relative of the absent Senator, took offense at
</p>
<p>these remarks concerning his State and relative,
</p>
<p>sought out Mr. Sumner, and inflicted severe blows
</p>
<p>upon him. In a court of justice, Mr. Brooks
</p>
<p>admitted the illegality of his act, and made the
</p>
<p>reparation required by the minister of justice, as
</p>
<p>an atonement for the offense. All this was purely
</p>
<p>a personal matter between the parties. Mr. Sum-
</p>
<p>ner spoke upon his personal responsibility, and
</p>
<p>Mr. Brooks resented it in his individual capacity.
</p>
<p>Neither acted for, or represented, a political party.
</p>
<p>If Mr. Sumner untruly described South Carolina,
</p>
<p>her motives and acts, or the character, qualifica-
</p>
<p>tions, and intentions of her Senator, it would be
</p>
<p>unjust to hold Colonel Fremont responsible. If
</p>
<p>Mr. Brooks acted illegally, violated the .sanctity
</p>
<p>of the Senate Chamber, or sought wrongfully to
</p>
<p>control the freedom of debate, it is equally unjust
</p>
<p>to hold Mr. Buchanan, or the Democratic party,
</p>
<p>accountable. On both sides they are personal

<p>friend, Major P. B. Reading, who will hand you
</p>
<p>this note, that you apologize for the injurious

<p>Colonel Mason replied as follows:

<p>" Angeles, .^pril I4, 1847.
</p>
<p>" Sir: I have just received your note of this
</p>
<p>evening, and can only repeat in writing what I

<p>stated to you verbally when we parted, viz: ' I
</p>
<p>thought you intended to be so. You best know
</p>
<p>whether you did or not.' Your not disavowing
</p>
<p>it left me to infer that I was not mistaken ; with

<p>that impression upon my mind, I can say noth-

</p>
<p>"ColonelR. B.Mason."
</p>
<p>It will be observed that Colonel Mason thought
</p>
<p>Fremont intended to be insolent to him, and that
</p>
<p>he, neither orally or otherwise, denied that he so
</p>
<p>intended. It is clear that if he had disavowed
</p>
<p>the intention to be insolent and insult Colonel
</p>
<p>Mason, the latter would have withdrawn his
</p>
<p>remarks. Colonel Mason then wrote him as
</p>
<p>follows:
</p>
<p>" Angeles, ^pHl 15, 1847.
</p>
<p>" Sir: With a view to the adjustment of my
</p>
<p>private affairs, it is necessary that I return to
</p>
<p>Monterey before I afford you the meeting you
</p>
<p>desire. We shall probably meet there within a
</p>
<p>few days of each ether. I will then, as soon as
</p>
<p>circumstances will permit, arrange the necessary
</p>
<p>preliminaries for a meeting.

<p>date, and, in reply, have the honor to state that
</p>
<p>1 will hold myself in readiness for a meeting at

<p>Monterey, at'such time as you may designate.

<p>" A day or two after these notes Colonel Mason
</p>
<p>went to Monterey; after Mason arrived there,
</p>
<p>22
</p>
<p>*" But this instance of Fremont's imperious, ex-
</p>
<p>acting, and unrestrained jjas.sions is not a solitary
</p>
<p>one. In 1850 his views of tlie freedom of sena-
</p>
<p>torial debate were conspicuously and strikingly
</p>
<p>exemplified. When the California land bill \vi\3
</p>
<p>before the Senate, Mr. Fopte, a Senatorfrom Mis-
</p>
<p>sissippi, made remarks which Fremont deemed
</p>
<p>derogatory to him, and he pronounced them false.
</p>
<p>The following account of the transaction was
</p>
<p>given in a prominent newspaper at the time:
</p>
<p>" Afterwards tliey met in the ante-chamber,
</p>
<p>when Fremont struck Foote and brought blood.
</p>
<p>They were immediately separated by Senator
</p>
<p>Clarke. Subsequently Fremont addressed a note
</p>
<p>to Foote, demanding a retraction of the language
</p>
<p>used by him in debate, to be signed in the pres-
</p>
<p>ence of witnesses, and a challenge note was left
</p>
<p>if he refused. Mr. Foote declined to sign the
</p>
<p>paper, but addressed a note in reply to Fremont,
</p>
<p>disclaiming any intention of giving any personal
</p>
<p>offense in the language used by him in debate."
</p>
<p>The friends of the parties deemed Mr. Foote 's
</p>
<p>note satisfoctory, ancl a card was published de-
</p>
<p>claring the matter adjusted. It will be seen that
</p>
<p>Fremont required an apology in writing, which,
</p>
<p>if not given, a challenge, which was left, was to
</p>
<p>become effective. It thus appears that Fremont
</p>
<p>proposed, if the words used were not retracted,
</p>
<p>to call a Senator to the field, with the view of
</p>
<p>taking his life, or losing his own. Let this be
</p>
<p>contrasted witll the case of blows given for a like
</p>
<p>cause. If obedience to his demands was not
</p>
<p>yielded, his intention was to sacrifice human life,
</p>
<p>under circumstances which would render it mur-

<p>der  and that, too, for words spoken in debate,
</p>
<p>and not intended to be personal. Ought not this
</p>
<p>act of Fremont to close the mouths of his sup-
</p>
<p>porters in relation to the Brooks and Sumner
</p>
<p>affair ? If they denounce the former, must they
</p>
<p>not also denounce and condemn Fremont? Did
</p>
<p>not Fremont, in the cases of Mason and Foote,
</p>
<p>seek to commit the far greater crime, and in the
</p>
<p>restraint of the liberty of speech and the freedom
</p>
<p>of debate ?
</p>
<p>But if the cases were parallel, it should be re-
</p>
<p>membered that the one is merely a supporter of
</p>
<p>tJie Democratic party, while the other has been
</p>
<p>cliosen by the " Republicans" as the represent-
</p>
<p>ative of their principles, with the hope of making
</p>
<p>him the Chief Magistrate of the Confederacy.
</p>
<p>Do his supporters approve his practice in these
</p>
<p>cases, and do they expect to follow his prece-
</p>
<p>dcjits? Do they wish them to prevail in our
</p>
<p>community? If elected, would Fremont carry
</p>
<p>OMt his own precedents in relation to the freedom
</p>
<p>of speech and debate? Do he and his supporters
</p>
<p>approve the pistol or rifle remedy for whatever
</p>
<p>gives them offense? Are not our laws ample for
</p>
<p>Die protection of character as well as property?
</p>
<p>Do they desire men whose passions are aroused
</p>
<p>to take the law into their own hands, and control
</p>
<p>their fellow-men with deadly weapons ? Do they
</p>
<p>wish to commit the destinies of our country to
</p>
<p>one whose instincts or passions impel him to
</p>
<p>seek the lives of those who speak otherwise than
</p>
<p>respectfully of him ?

<p>HE WOULD NOT OBEY HIS ORDERS,

<p>evidence on Colonel Fremont's trial, Senate Doc-
</p>
<p>aments 1847- '8, vol. 5, pp. 38, 39.)
</p>
<p>Commodore Stockton did, by a commission ]
</p>
<p>dated the day previous, (January 16, 1847,) ap-
</p>
<p>point him Governor and commander-in-chief of
</p>
<p>the conquered Territory, and he obeyed his or- ;
</p>
<p>ders, and continued to refuse obedience to those |
</p>
<p>of General Kearny. He was charged before the l
</p>
<p>court-martial with " mutiny," " disobedience of
</p>
<p>llie lawful command of his superior officer," and
</p>
<p>" conduct to the prejudice of good order and mil-
</p>
<p>itary discipline," and convicted upon each charge,
</p>
<p>and sentenced to be " dismissed from the ser-
</p>
<p>vice." President Polk disapproved the finding
</p>
<p>(Ml the first charge, but approved of the last two.
</p>
<p>The evidence of General Kearny, which is
</p>
<p>wholly uncontl-adicted, clearly shows that the
</p>
<p>sole question with Colonel Fremont was his'ap-
</p>
<p>ix)intment to the office of Governor, which, after
</p>
<p>having his eye upon his Mariposa purchase, and
</p>
<p>other transactions in California, became an im-
</p>
<p>portant matter to him personally. He expressly
</p>
<p>declared that he would not obey Commodore
</p>
<p>Stockton, ' ' unless he would appoint him Govern-
</p>
<p>ov at once. " The inference is indisputable, that
</p>
<p>if the Commodore did not do so, then he would
</p>
<p>obey General Kearny, who had expressed awill-
</p>
<p>ino-ness to appoint him at a future day, and as
</p>
<p>soon as things became quiet, and before his depart-
</p>
<p>ure for home. Had Commodore Stockton been

</p>
<p>impelled the latter, he doubtless would have re-
</p>
<p>fused him both the appointment and his confi-

<p>dence. No one doubts that the Commodore
</p>
<p>tliought himself right in what he insisted on, and
</p>
<p>Lis high-toned and gallant spirit would have

<p>slirunk from according anything to such selfish,

<p>and naval service do not show another instance |
</p>
<p>of an officer's obedience being made dependent j
</p>
<p>upon his appointment to a high office. Is there !

<p>a high-minded, honest man who can approve the j

<p>wince in advance at these astounding develop-
</p>
<p>ments. We have not space to-day for any com-
</p>
<p>ment, and we give a general outline of the facts
</p>
<p>Slated, so far as we have received them. We
</p>
<p>premise by saying, that the documents show that
</p>
<p>the board of claims only allowed >^1 40,000 of the
</p>
<p>claims set up by Fremont, or one stvenlh of the
</p>
<p>whole amount, leaving some EIGHT HUN-
</p>
<p>DRED THOUSAND DOLLARS STILL UN-
</p>
<p>PAID, and which will never be paid until Fre-
</p>
<p>mont is elected President.
</p>
<p>Look at some of the items: The first item is a
</p>
<p>daim for $24,750 for cattle said to have been taken
</p>
<p>24
</p>
<p>points of resemblance between the first Wash-
</p>
<p>ington and the "second," are thus set forth by
</p>
<p>the Rochester Union:
</p>
<p>" Washington never dogged a man fifom place
</p>
<p>to place and endeavored to badger him into a
</p>
<p>duel.
</p>
<p>" Washington never challenged a man to mor-
</p>
<p>tal combat.
</p>
<p>" Washington never speculated in beef, to the
</p>
<p>prejudice of his country.
</p>
<p>" Washington never certified ' on honor' to the
</p>
<p>correctness of a charge, and then had it cut down
</p>
<p>by the auditing officer from ten thousand to fifty
</p>
<p>dollars.
</p>
<p>" Washington never accepted a nomination
</p>
<p>from a party which proscribed foreigners and
</p>
<p>Catholics as unworthy the name of American.
</p>
<p>" Washington never encouraged the formation
</p>
<p>of sectional parties."
</p>
<p>Danii-l Webster
</p>
<p>Said, in a speech delivered in 1850, in alluding to
</p>
<p>the alienation of the North from the South:
</p>
<p>' "' This prejudice has been produced by the in-
</p>
<p>cessant attrition of abolition doctrines, by abo-
</p>
<p>lition presses, and by abolition lectures upon the
</p>
<p>common mind. No drum-head, in the longest
</p>
<p>day's march, was ever more incessantly beaten
</p>
<p>than the feelings in certain parts of the North.
</p>
<p>They have been beaten incessantly, every month,
</p>
<p>and every day, and every hour, by the din and
</p>
<p>roll and rub-a-dub of the abolition presses and
</p>
<p>the abolition lectures, and that it is which has
</p>
<p>created these prejudices."
</p>

<p>A Word to the People.
</p>
<p>In view of the angry and dangerous contro-
</p>
<p>versy that is now agitating the country, we
</p>
<p>would ask a thoughtful attention to the mosA re-
</p>
<p>markable contrast between the character of the
</p>
<p>men who framed our Government, and brought
</p>
<p>it into successful operation, and those who are
</p>
<p>now prosecuting every means of desperation to
</p>
<p>sectionalize or subvert the Government. For
</p>
<p>wisdom, virtue, and patiotism  for all the great
</p>
<p>and glorious elements of character that dignify
</p>
<p>and adorn human nature in its highest and purest
</p>
<p>range  Washington and his compatriots hold
</p>
<p>unequaled eminence. Through every trial of
</p>
<p>Jong-suflering, danger, and discouragement, they
</p>
<p>weift tl) rough a war of more than seven years,
</p>
<p>and sealed with their blood the mighty triumph
</p>
<p>of our independence.
</p>
<p>This was the first step; the next was to form a
</p>
<p>Government to carry out the great principles for
</p>
<p>which they fought.
</p>
<p>The same men sheathed the sword and took
</p>
<p>up the pen in peaceful, solemn council, to frame
</p>
<p>a Government for the people by the people. It
</p>
<p>was a great task imposed upon wisdom and vir-
</p>
<p>tue to conquer the conflicting interests and opin-
</p>
<p>ions that were inseparable from the work. These
</p>
<p>were to be reconciled and harmonized as neces-
</p>
<p>sary to the consummation of the great end and
</p>
<p>object.
</p>
<p>They accomplished it, to their everlasting honor,
</p>
<p>by cherishing a holy brotherhood, by subordin-
</p>
<p>ating cverytiiing to the one great purpdse, and
</p>
<p>by laying covenant, concessions, and coippro-
</p>
<p>mises on the alter of their infant country.
