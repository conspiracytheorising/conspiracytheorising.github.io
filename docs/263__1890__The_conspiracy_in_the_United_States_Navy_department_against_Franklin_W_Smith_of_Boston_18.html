</p>
<p>Dear Sir :
</p>
<p>I have received the two pamphlets which you are good
</p>
<p>enough to send me, and which I have read with great interest
</p>
<p>and satisfaction. I do not think it was necessary to publish
</p>
<p>this Naval pamphlet in order to vindicate your reputation, but
</p>
<p>since you have published it, I am sorry that you have not
</p>
<p>mentioned the name of the official who caused you so much
</p>
<p>annoyance and loss.
</p>
<p>1 have also read the account of the Pompeian House at
</p>
<p>Saratoga with considerable surprise. I should very much like
</p>
<p>to see the museum, for such it must be; and if I should visit
</p>
<p>Saratoga, I will make a point of doing so. Mrs. Hewitt is also
</p>
<p>equally interested in the account, and we both thank you for
</p>
<p>having sent it to us and for your public spirit in reproducing so
</p>
<p>successfully a reminder of past ages.
</p>
<p>.-...^ Yours sincerely,

</p>
<p>My Dear Sir :
</p>
<p>You are quite at liberty to use any letter of mine in any
</p>
<p>publication you may see fit to make. No one at this late day
</p>
<p>attributes any unfair motives or action to you. In numerous
</p>
<p>transactions which my firm had with you prior to the war and
</p>
<p>during its continuance, your integrity was never doubted, and
</p>
<p>every obligation was rigidly fulfilled. I really cannot under-
</p>
<p>stand why you should any longer feel sensitive on the subject,
</p>
<p>although you suffered a very great injustice, and I suppose it
</p>
<p>can never be repaired.
</p>
<p>With kind regards,

</p>
<p>Extract from an Editorial in the " New York
</p>
<p>Journal of Commerce," January 2oth, 1866.
</p>
<p>" Mr. Franklin W. Smith is a well-known merchant of the city
</p>
<p>of Boston. Boston is the principal city of Massachusetts. Massa-
</p>
<p>chusetts is the principal State of New England. New England
</p>
<p>governs the United States for the present. The United States
</p>
<p>compose a country distinguished as the patron of justice, and the
</p>
<p>paradise of free principles. This is the 19th century.
</p>
<p>"All these facts must be carefully borne in mind, lest any one
</p>
<p>should imagine that it is a romance which forms the subject of
</p>
<p>this article.
</p>
<p>"We have before us a pamphlet of sixty-one pages, being the
</p>
<p>report of a special committee of the Boston Board of Trade, which
</p>
<p>vouches for the truth of the story it contains. The statements in
</p>
<p>the pamphlet are signed by the following names : W. B. Spooner,
</p>
<p>Charles G. Nazro, Charles O. Whitmore, Otis Norcross, James
</p>
<p>C. Converse, Joseph M. Wightman, Lorenzo Sabine. These will
</p>
<p>be recognized by many as the names of highly respectable mer-
</p>
<p>chants in the said city of Boston, State of Massachusetts afore-
</p>
<p>said. They are men of truth and veracity."
</p>
<p>#****
</p>
<p>" Mr. Sumner and the Board of Trade make it clear enough
</p>
<p>that Mr. Smith was the victim of persecution on the part of the
</p>
<p>government officials."
</p>
<p>" Let us find a lesson in all this. The Boston Board of Trade
</p>
<p>has done well to print such a pamphlet."
</p>
<p>*****
</p>
<p>" Reparation can never be made for these wrongs. The
</p>
<p>national debt doubled would not suffice to make due return.
</p>
<p>Money can never do it."
</p>
<p>** This is indeed a strange history to be enacted in this loyal com-
</p>
<p>monwealth, where the courts of justice are in peaceful operation
</p>
<p>and the laws obeyed with cheerful alacrity; but it is one only of
</p>
<p>the many illustrations, with which history is full, with what facility

<p>Letter prom Hon. H. L. Dawes, U. S. Senator from
</p>
<p>Massachusetts, to Franklin W. Smith.
</p>
<p>PiTTSFiELD, Mass., August 20, 1889.
</p>
<p>My Dear Sir  I am in receipt of your communica-
</p>
<p>tion in reference to the court-martial proceedings insti-
</p>
<p>tuted against you during the war. I am reminded by
</p>
<p>it of a long delayed duty. Of those to whom your
</p>
<p>long and honorable career as a business man is known ;
</p>
<p>who were familiar at the time with that transaction,
</p>
<p>and had occasion and opportunity to know its animus,
</p>
<p>few are now living. I was in Congress at the time,
</p>
<p>a,nd with my then colleagues, was called upon to
</p>
<p>make myself familiar with all its details, and with
</p>
<p>the result most honorable to you. I have wondered that
</p>
<p>you have not published to the world the entire record,
</p>
<p>with Mr. Lincoln's endorsement upon it, in his own
</p>
<p>hand-writing, of his estimate of your integrity and his
</p>
<p>trenchant words dismissing the case.
</p>
<p>I write this because, those who instituted the pro-
</p>
<p>ceeding, and the great President who condemned it,
</p>
<p>and those of my colleagues, who with me specially
</p>
<p>examined it, are all dead. I think I ought to leave on

</p>
<p>record the opinion which I then formed, after an ex-
</p>
<p>11
</p>
<p>haustive examination, and in which I know the entire
</p>
<p>Massachusetts delegation in Congress at the time shared,
</p>
<p>of the outrageous and unjust character of the whole
</p>
<p>proceeding. This examination was made by Mr. Sum-
</p>
<p>ner and the late Hon. B. F. Thomas and myself for the
</p>
<p>delegation.
</p>
<p>It is true that in the exciting times of the war, when
</p>
<p>large transactions were often from necessity carried on
</p>
<p>in a hurried and careless manner, and when bad passions
</p>
<p>were rife and ugly purposes were engendered, a prose-
</p>
<p>cution by court-martial was instituted against you ; at
</p>
<p>the time a large contractor for supplies for the navy.
</p>
<p>Courts-martial were then so frequent and resorted to
</p>
<p>so often for sinister ends that it came to be a saying
</p>
<p>that "Courts-martial are organized to convict." This
</p>
<p>one conducted the trial in a manner and with a relentless
</p>
<p>pursuit which, looked at from the standpoint of these
</p>
<p>calm times, would be pronounced brutal by all fair
</p>
<p>minded men.
</p>
<p>It not only seized the accused by military force but
</p>
<p>entered his private dwelling and carried off all his
</p>
<p>private as well as business papers, even breaking locks
</p>
<p>and possessing itself of the letters that had passed
</p>
<p>between him and his wife. It examined, as with a
</p>
<p>microscope, every item of a business with the govern-
</p>
<p>ment, covering several years and twelve hundred thou-
</p>
<p>sand dollars, searching for fraud as a hunter pursues his
</p>
<p>game, and after months of such a trial of such varied
</p>
<p>and complicated transactions, they could only find, and
</p>
<p>that on technical grounds, that the government had been
</p>
<p>defrauded in the sum of one hundred dollars. When
</p>
<p>this record came up to Mr. Lincoln for approval, he set
</p>
<p>it all aside in words endorsed on its back, which carry

</p>
<p>with them the highest testimonial to your integrity.
</p>
<p>Ill
</p>
<p>The result made it clear to every judicial mind which
</p>
<p>examined it, that the prosecution was instigated and
</p>
<p>pressed, because your straightforward ways interfered
</p>
<p>with questionable methods of transacting business, and
</p>
<p>their success rendered your removal necessary. I have
</p>
<p>good reason to know that Secretary Welles himself
</p>
<p>became convinced of thi, and deeply regretted that he
</p>
<p>had unwittingly been made the instrument of such
</p>
<p>injustice.
</p>
<p>I am glad of tfee opportunity to furnish you with this
</p>
<p>statement, and remain as ever,
</p>
<p>Truly, yours,
</p>
<p>H. L. DAWES.
</p>
<p>It is with pleasure that I respond to the suggestion
</p>
<p>of Senator Dawes, by this publication of a personal
</p>
<p>experience during the War of the Rebellion  the full
</p>
<p>history of which was prepared more than twenty years
</p>
<p>ago to be issued in the event of my decease. Inasmuch
</p>
<p>as I have been mercifully spared to see the maturity of
</p>
<p>a new generation, (while almost all of those who sought
</p>
<p>my destruction have been called to their final account,)
</p>
<p>this recital becomes a duty, since few now living are
</p>
<p>cognizant of that case. It is therefore revived, in order
</p>
<p>that partial or erroneous statements relating thereto may
</p>
<p>be avoided; as well as the grave responsibility attending
</p>
<p>the utterance of such statements.*
</p>
<p>In abnegation of personal feeling toward my perse-
</p>
<p>cutors ; burying bitter memories of them in their graves,
</p>
<p>I suppress their names ; and tell the story from official
</p>
<p>and public documents. These are indisputable, impar-
</p>
<p>tial and final.
</p>
<p>* I am advised by eminent counsel that anj^ distorted or injurious men-

</p>
<p>tion of this history exposes the author to severe legal retribution.
</p>
<p>IV
</p>
<p>The Report of the Boston Board of Trade in review
</p>
<p>of the case, and the paper of Senator Sumner to Presi-
</p>
<p>dent Lincoln, quote a threatening letter from the chief
</p>
<p>of a Naval Bureau. It is known as " the-dead-cock-
</p>
<p>in-the-pit" letter. Vide p. 51 and Addenda III.
</p>
<p>The writer of the Report submitted to me whether
</p>
<p>the name of the author of the letter might be suppressed.
</p>
<p>I assented to the erasure  but with keen remembrance
</p>
<p>that he had aimed a deadly assault upon my own.
</p>
<p>The following statement is a slight compensation for
</p>
<p>the injustice recited; for, while many may be conscious
</p>
<p>of integrity, there is no instance of its vindication
</p>
<p>against the war-power and treasury of the National
</p>
<p>Government, wielded with like desperation and malign-
</p>
<p>ity. Personal satisfaction at the defeat of this onslaught
</p>
<p>is of slight importance compared to its public relations :
</p>
<p>First. Toward protection of witnesses summoned by
</p>
<p>Congress, against the revenge of officials implicated by
</p>
<p>their testimony.
</p>
<p>Second. As a warning against the surrender of civil-
</p>
<p>ians to military power.
</p>
<p>The seriousness of the above considerations was recog-
</p>
<p>nized in consequent repeal by Congress of the law which
</p>
<p>permitted the outrage ; and it has given to the case of
</p>
<p>the U. S. Navy Department m. Franklin W. Smith the
</p>
<p>historical status of a cause celehre.
</p>
<p>The Act of Congress of July 17, 1862, provides that
</p>
<p>" any person who shall contract to furnish supplies of
</p>
<p>any kind or description for the army or the navy, he
</p>
<p>shall be deemed and taken as a part of the land or naval
</p>
<p>forces of the United States, for which he shall contract
</p>
<p>to furnish said supplies, and be subject to the rules and
</p>
<p>regulations for the government of the land and naval

</p>
<p>forces of the United States."
</p>
<p>The Report of the Boston Board of Trade upon the
</p>
<p>case of Franklin W. Smith comments upon this legisla-
</p>
<p>tion, as follows :
</p>
<p>"The committee quote the act of Congress and say,
</p>
<p>that upon the construction which has been given to it
</p>
<p>they do not see why every person who contracts to fur-
</p>
<p>nish a lump of chalk, for the use of the army or navy,
</p>
<p>is not liable  on offence to some official personage 
</p>
<p>to a trial by court-martial. Hi ^ ^
</p>
<p>This is unconditionally monstrous. No trial by jury!"
</p>
<p>%**%*
</p>
<p>" ' I will maintain as long as I live,' said Dupin, the
</p>
<p>great French advocate, ' that the condemnation of Mar-
</p>
<p>shal Ney was not just, for his defence was not free.'
</p>
<p>Can there ever be Sifree defence for a civilian arraigned
</p>
<p>under the act of July 17, 1862 ?
</p>
<p>"We have read that Niceron, a merchant, and the
</p>
<p>agent of commercial companies in Paris, was committed
</p>
<p>to the Bastile simply for remonstrating against a pro-
</p>
<p>jected monopoly in the article of whale oil ; so, too, we
</p>
<p>have read that the Star Chamber imposed a fine of
</p>
<p>2,000, sterling money of the realm, on .Chambers, a
</p>
<p>merchant of London, for refusing to pay poundage and
</p>
<p>tonnage, and for saying that ' merchants were more
</p>
<p>screwed up and wronged in England than in Turkey.
</p>
<p>" The sixteenth section of the act of Congress of July
</p>
<p>17, 1862, as relates to a class of citizens in civil life, re-
</p>
<p>vives the Bastile and the Star Chamber. Nay, more ;
</p>
<p>overleaping eighteen centuries of Christian civilization
</p>
<p>at a single bound, it goes back to heathen Rome and re-
</p>
<p>vives maxims of Caesar, that ' arms and laws do not
</p>
<p>flourish together; ' that ' war will not bear much liberty
</p>
<p>of speech.'

<p>reputation, this Report, if accepted, will become the

</p>
<p>judgment of this Board, and a part of the commercial
</p>
<p>history of Boston. We measure our words. Seldom in
</p>
<p>legislation has there been a more terrible, a more appall-
</p>
<p>ing mistake, and the very member of Congress who re-
</p>
<p>ported it in bill to the House, magnanimously owns it
</p>
<p>now, and, on the second day of March, 1865, stood up in
</p>
<p>his place and confessed his error.
</p>
<p>In the U. S. Senate, February, 1865, in debate upon

<p>men ; it is enough for me to deal with my own ; but,

<p>standing here under all the responsibilities which attach

<p>longs to me  careful of my word, I think, as most men

<p>I aver before the Senate, before the country and before

<p>God, that I have not a shadow of doubt that the sole

<p>offense for which Mr. Smith was arrested was the evi-

<p>dence that he gave upon the occasion."

<p>In a subsequent debate, March, 1865, Hon. H. L.

<p>Dawes, of Massachusetts, upon the same subject, said :
</p>
<p>" I do not say why this unjustifiable course was pur-

<p>immediately after they had testified before an investi-

<p>"In carrying out what I was endeavoring to do, I, in

<p>co-operation with others, reported to the House a Bill

</p>
<p>that it was an extreme measure. In putting into the
</p>
<p>hands of the officers of the Government this extreme
</p>
<p>power, I had confidence that they would exercise it with
</p>
<p>moderation and reason. But, Mr. Chairman, I am sorry
</p>
<p>to say, that my observation of the administration of that

<p>law, of which I take to myself some part of the responsi-
</p>
<p>bility, has been such during the past year or two as to
</p>
<p>compel me to support this amendment. Sir, we seem to

<p>EXTRACTS FROM PUBLIC DOCUMENTS,
</p>
<p>1 862" 1 865,
</p>
<p>In Relation to the Case of
</p>
<p>THE U. S. NAVY DEPARTMENT
</p>
<p>against
</p>
<p>FRANKLIN W. SMITH.
</p>
<p>PART FIRST.
</p>
<p>Reform of the old Contract System through the
</p>
<p>Effort of F. W. Smith.
</p>
<p>Upon the election of Abraham Lincoln to the presi-
</p>
<p>dency of the United States the hardware house of Smith
</p>
<p>Brothers & Co. made their first tenders for supplies to
</p>
<p>the Navy Department.
</p>
<p>On the 24th of February, 1862, and before the fulfil-
</p>
<p>ment of his first contract, Mr. Franklin W. Smith
</p>
<p>addressed a printed paper to the Chief of the Bureau
</p>
<p>of Yards and Docks, in argument that the contract
</p>
<p>system as then existing, opened facilities for gross
</p>
<p>wrong upon the government. This paper, with others
</p>
<p>hereinafter mentioned, may be found in the Report of
</p>
<p>the Select Committee on Naval Supplies of the United
</p>
<p>States Senate of July 4, 1864.
</p>
<p>The following extracts will indicate its tenor :
</p>
<p>" Having decided to attempt some government con-
</p>
<p>tracts we analyzed the published reports of the department
</p>
<p>in previous years to discover the modus operandi. We
</p>
<p>were astonished that a system that left such records of
</p>
<p>bargaining could have been so long maintained.

</p>
<p>On the 10th February, 1863, he addressed a printed
</p>
<p>paper to the Secretary of the Navy and Mr. Sedgwick,
</p>
<p>Chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs, proposing
</p>
<p>a remedy for the discreditable system hitherto existing
</p>
<p>by law ; extracts from which are as follows :
</p>
<p>PAPER TO THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY AND
</p>
<p>HON. CHARLES B. SEDGWICK.
</p>
<p>Washington, February 10, 1863.
</p>
<p>The bill before the House proposes to remedy evils in
</p>
<p>the contract system of the Navy Department that have
</p>
<p>existed for many years. The disadvantages that have
</p>
<p>followed to the government have been inherent in the
</p>
<p>system itself. In two bureaus of the department a sys-
</p>
<p>tem of proposals by advertisement has been maintained,
</p>
<p>that in result was a mere matter of chance to the re-
</p>
<p>spective parties. Thus in the Bureau of Yards and
</p>
<p>Docks it hag been customary to advertise for a great
</p>
<p>variety of articles which were only to be called for if
</p>
<p>wanted. The chance, therefore, for the bidder to calcu-
</p>
<p>late upon is, what articles will he wanted .^
</p>
<p>% :fc % * *
</p>
<p>If the contracts of the department, as published for
</p>
<p>years past, be analyzed, it will be found that a system
</p>
<p>of bidding has been maintained by which the merchan-
</p>
<p>dise advertised has been offered to the government at very
</p>
<p>much less than its value in the market ; the bidders hav-
</p>
<p>ing calculated according to their estimate of the real wants
</p>
<p>of government. The law has required that the lowest

</p>
<p>bid, in aggregate upon the whole, should be accepted.
</p>
<p>12
</p>
<p>The merchant, therefore, who would approach the
</p>
<p>government with his offer, must follow these old prece-
</p>
<p>dents or be entirely distanced by his competitors.
</p>
<p>Honorable mercantile houses have desired and urged
</p>
<p>a reform in the system that would place the transactions
</p>
<p>of the department upon a more legitimate basis to all
</p>
<p>parties concerned.
</p>
<p>H: Hi Hi H: Ht
</p>
<p>THE REMEDY.
</p>
<p>The bill reported by the committee is an advance
</p>
<p>towards remedying the evils of the system. In two of
</p>
<p>its provisions, however, in my judgment, it is defective :
</p>
<p>First. By providing that there may be an increase of
</p>
<p>yiftp per centum or a decrease of twenty -five per centum
</p>
<p>upon the quantities advertised, the game of chance is
</p>
<p>still open.
</p>
<p>Let the Navy Department, as the War Department,
</p>
<p>advertise for precisely what is to be received ; no more,
</p>
<p>no less. There can then be no " nominal prices." They
</p>
<p>will disappear; for the merchant will know that the
</p>
<p>merchandise described is to be furnished. If the War
</p>
<p>Department wants 100 ambulances and 200 wagons,
</p>
<p>they contract for and demand like quantities as adver-
</p>
<p>tised. There is no chance to estimate that there may
</p>
<p>be delivered, under the contract, 50 ambulances and 500
</p>
<p>wagons. The War Department, therefore, receives no
</p>
<p>bids at '' nominal prices."
</p>
<p>If the Navy Department is uncertain as to its want
</p>
<p>of some articles, let them be bought when the demand
</p>
<p>shall arise. It can buy in open market, or it can direct
</p>
<p>its agents to advertise, at .any time, for one day, or
</p>
<p>one month, for any additional articles that may be

</p>
<p>demanded.
</p>
<p>13
</p>
<p>If the schedules, as contracted for, are being rapidly-
</p>
<p>exhausted, the department can, before the contracts
</p>
<p>expire, advertise for more merchandise, by the provision
</p>
<p>of the bill of the committee.
</p>
<p>Second. Having thus effectually removed all occasion
</p>
<p>or opportunity for nominal prices, the clause allowing
</p>
<p>the rejection of bids for nominal prices can be omitted.
</p>
<p>It gives an opportunity for unfairness by an arbitrary
</p>
<p>decision, as to what is a nominal price. One merchant,
</p>
<p>perhaps, by unusual facilities possessed, may afford to
</p>
<p>supply articles less than any other parties. The govern-
</p>
<p>ment would suffer, and the merchant be wronged, if the
</p>
<p>bid were to be rejected because the price appeared too
</p>
<p>cheap.
</p>
<p>The amendments to the resolution suggested by the
</p>
<p>above are 
</p>
<p>Fwst. The omission of the clause allowing variations
</p>
<p>from the quantities advertised.
</p>
<p>Second, The omission of the clause allowing the
</p>
<p>rejection of bids for nominal prices : because, if the
</p>
<p>quantities are fixed as above mentioned, there can he no
</p>
<p>nominal prices.
</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted.

<p>Letter to Hon. D. W. Gooch, M. C, from Massachu-
</p>
<p>setts. Printed in U. S. Senate Report :
</p>
<p>New York, February 12, 1863.
</p>
<p>My Dear Sir : I am glad to notice by the papers that
</p>
<p>the resolution concerning contracts was recommitted
</p>
<p>after debate, as I feared my suggestions were quite too
</p>
<p>late.
</p>
<p>We have really no pecuniary interest in the amend-
</p>
<p>ments suggested ; for it is impossible to estimate whether
</p>
<p>the bill with or without them will be most favorable
</p>
<p>to our profit, if we make further contracts. My motive
</p>
<p>in the effort made was, sincerely: firsts for the good
</p>
<p>of the government; second, that it might appear that
</p>
<p>all merchants who became contractors were not inevi-
</p>
<p>tably, because in business connexions with the govern-
</p>
<p>ment,  selfish sharpers.
</p>
<p>The record we have made to date is a clear one; we
</p>
<p>are content to be judged by it. I regard it as most for-
</p>
<p>tunate that, without knowledge that any such legisla-
</p>
<p>tion was pending, it happened in my way to place our
</p>
<p>record with the Naval Committee.
</p>
<p>If in the course of the debate sweeping animadversion
</p>
<p>may be made upon contractors under the system hitherto,
</p>
<p>your sentiments of fairness, regard for the fame of Bos-
</p>
<p>ton merchants, and (may I presume!) your confidence in
</p>
<p>the undersigned, may prompt you to speak in reply.
</p>
<p>With reference to " nominal prices," upon which so
</p>
<p>much is said, this is our reply : We were compelled to
</p>
<p>use an old system, provided by law, as it long had been
</p>
<p>used and accepted by the department, or retire from the

<p>competition.
</p>
<p>15
</p>
<p>If all houses who would be honorable dealers with the
</p>
<p>government thus retired from the held, the government,
</p>
<p>with a bad system, would be entirely in bad hands.
</p>
<p>We did our part, as soon as we comprehended the evils
</p>
<p>of the system, in recording our regret that they existed,
</p>
<p>and our desire for their remedy.
</p>
<p>With a renewal of thanks for your courtesy,
</p>
<p>I am yours, respectfully and truly,
</p>
<p>FRANKLIN W. SMITH.
</p>
<p>Hon. D. W. GrOOCH, Washington, D. C.
</p>
<p>Through the concurrent effort of Hon. Messrs. Gooch
</p>
<p>and Sedgwick, and in accordance with the recommenda-
</p>
<p>tions of Smith Brothers & Co., the joint resolution
</p>
<p>approved March 3, 1863, which was in place of that re-
</p>
<p>committed in February, provided that " every contract
</p>
<p>shall require the delivery of a specified quantity."
</p>
<p>This requirement of the law, that the Navy Depart-
</p>
<p>ment should contract for fixed quantities, caused nominal-
</p>
<p>prices to disappear at once from the bids upon the next
</p>
<p>proposals for supplies.

<p>Thus, as was remarked to Mr. Sedgwick, " paradoxi-

<p>Franklin W. Smith, Esq. :
</p>
<p>Sir  In a communication, under date of the 17th
</p>
<p>ultimo, Hon. Charles B. Sedgwick, Commissioner of the
</p>
<p>Naval Code, expresses a desire to obtain from " gentle-
</p>
<p>men practically acquainted with the subject," informa-
</p>
<p>tion as to "the best and most economical mode of pur-
</p>
<p>chase of supplies for the navy, and the one most likely
</p>
<p>to protect the government from fraud."
</p>
<p>Among others, he submits the following questions :
</p>
<p>FirsL " Whether the present contract system might
</p>
<p>be modified and changed so as to avoid objection and
</p>
<p>prevent fraud."
</p>
<p>Second, " Whether any more thorough and strict
</p>
<p>system of inspection and accounting for supplies and
</p>
<p>material purchased ought to be adopted to secure the

<p>department against imposition."
</p>
<p>I should be glad to have you state your judgment
</p>
<p>upon these questions, to be inclosed to the Commissioner,
</p>
<p>as suggested by your observation and experience during

<p>the period of your business relations with the depart-

<p>17
</p>
<p>Boston, December 11, 1863.
</p>
<p>Hon. E. L. Norton :
</p>
<p>Sir  I respond with pleasure to your request for the
</p>
<p>statement of my judgment upon inquiries submitted by
</p>
<p>the Commissioner of the Naval Code, viz. :
</p>
<p>First. "Whether the present contract system might
</p>
<p>be modified and changed, so as to avoid objection and
</p>
<p>prevent fraud."
</p>
<p>Second. " Whether any more thorough and strict
</p>
<p>system of inspection and accounting for supplies and
</p>
<p>materials purchased ought to be adopted to secure the
</p>
<p>department against imposition."
</p>
<p>" The joint resolution regulating contracts with the
</p>
<p>Navy Department," approved March 3, 1863, provided
</p>
<p>" that every contract shall require the delivery of a spe-
</p>
<p>cific quantity." This was a decided reformation of the
</p>
<p>old system for unlimited supplies, upon the lowest
</p>
<p>aggregate bid upon a quantity ; which left upon the
</p>
<p>published report of the department, for several years,
</p>
<p>such absurd records of government bargains.
</p>
<p>In a communication addressed by me to the chairman
</p>
<p>of the Committee on Naval Affairs, in February, 1863,
</p>
<p>the prediction was made that if the Navy Department
</p>
<p>would advertise for " no more and no less " than the
</p>
<p>quantity to be received under the contract, fictitious
</p>
<p>and excessive prices, which had been an evil and a
</p>
<p>reproach, would disappear. Existing contracts for spe-
</p>
<p>cific quantities, executed under the present law, dem-
</p>
<p>onstrate the truth of the assertion. By this reform,
</p>
<p>therefore, the most prominent evils of past years have
</p>
<p>been removed.
</p>
<p>Yet additional safeguards of law, scrupulously ap-

<p>dence of the community can be commanded, and before
</p>
<p>18
</p>
<p>there can be certainty tliat the obligations of contract-
</p>
<p>ors are faithfully fuJlilled.
</p>
<p>These safeguards are required as to the following
</p>
<p>questions :
</p>
<p>First. Is there assurance to the public of absolute
</p>
<p>fairness in the reception of bids and award of contracts ?
</p>
<p>Second. Are the schedules of merchandise for which
</p>
<p>bids are invited sufficiently explicit in the description
</p>
<p>of merchandise to be furnished ?
</p>
<p>Third. Is the system for the receipt of merchandise
</p>
<p>so systematically protected that government cannot be
</p>
<p>defrauded in quantity or quality ?
</p>
<p>For satisfaction to the mercantile community upon the
</p>
<p>first inquiry above suggested, it must be known that
</p>
<p>all preliminary arrangements for the award of contracts
</p>
<p>are scrupulously guarded against collusion of clerks
</p>
<p>with favored parties, and against inaccuracy in compu-
</p>
<p>tations or irregularity in the form of bids.
</p>
<p>The advertisement for proposals should state that the
</p>
<p>opening of bids (no longer, as formerly, in secret with
</p>
<p>chiefs and clerks of bureaus) is by law provided to be
</p>
<p>in the presence of bidders.
</p>
<p>Bids should be received in closed safes prepared for
</p>
<p>the purpose, secured against all inspection until the hour
</p>
<p>of opening named in the advertisement. Then, in pres-
</p>
<p>sence of the competing parties or their agents, they
</p>
<p>should be withdrawn, sorted and stamped with a seal
</p>
<p>privately retained by chiefs of bureaus for the purpose..
</p>
<p>No bids should be received after the hour of opening.
</p>
<p>Bids should not be indorsed with the numbers of th&
</p>
<p>classes named within them.
</p>
<p>{From such indorsements it may he learned hy clerks that
</p>
<p>there are no bids for certain classes ; and through collusion,

</p>
<p>exorbitant prices may he named for said classes. It is believed
</p>
<p>19
</p>
<p>that in the case of certain contracts where enon'mous prices
</p>
<p>were obtained, such wrongful advantage must haw been em-
</p>
<p>ployed.)
</p>
<p>All bids containing erroneous computations, omissions
</p>
<p>of prices for any articles, figures or writing in pencil, or
</p>
<p>having other suspicious appearances or informalities,
</p>
<p>should be rejected.
</p>
<p>{Bids haw been received containing several arithmetical
</p>
<p>errors, but all against the government; wherein, while prices
</p>
<p>have been exorbitant, the extensions have been minus, and
</p>
<p>the aggregate the lowest. It is a discreditable fact that such
</p>
<p>bids have been actually executed in contract. Ordinary
</p>
<p>mathematical calculations, in private life made sure with the
</p>
<p>grocer and baker, have passed the inspection and notice of
</p>
<p>government offices, grossly erroneous; the result of these
</p>
<p>errors being in such loss to government and such gain to the
</p>
<p>contractor as to suggest that they could not have been in all
</p>
<p>intents Mis-calculations.)
</p>
<p>The opening of bids should be at a continuous sitting
</p>
<p>if practicable.
</p>
<p>If adjournment be necessary, unopened bids should
</p>
<p>be secured from inspection of all parties in the interim.
</p>
<p>Examination of computations and forms should be
</p>
<p>made only in the offices of the department ; and for no
</p>
<p>purpose whatever should bids be removed therefrom
</p>
<p>until contracts have been executed.
</p>
<p>(Instances have been remarked where bids for different
</p>
<p>"yards have been taken by clerks to their homes for examination.)
</p>
<p>These details are by no means over-cautious in trans-
</p>
<p>actions which involve not only large expenditure of
</p>
<p>money, but the good faith of government toward the
</p>
<p>people. Officers who have in charge such important
</p>
<p>business interests should not be satisfied merely with their

<p>Thirdly. Is the system for the receipt of merchandise
</p>
<p>so systematically protected that government cannot be
</p>
<p>defrauded in quantity or quality ?
</p>
<p>Thii is a question vital to the interests of the government
</p>
<p>under any system of purchase. No fairness of price, no
</p>
<p>high standard of quality, can compete against the
</p>
<p>fraudulent collusion of dishonest traders with weigh-
</p>
<p>masters and receiving clerks.
</p>
<p>Suspicions have long existed as to the prevalence of
</p>
<p>this style of robbery in navy yards. Indeed, it is fre-
</p>
<p>quently remarked, as an irremediable evil, that govern-
</p>
<p>ment must be robbed to some extent in the delivery of
</p>
<p>merchandise ; because it is inevitable that there will be
</p>
<p>some dishonest men. Yet because of this extraordinary
</p>
<p>exposure to wrong, extraordinary protective and detective
</p>
<p>measures, are demanded at the hands of executive officers
</p>
<p>in the departments. A system should be devised so
</p>
<p>thorough in its checks and counterchecks, that rogues
</p>
<p>cannot disarrange its machinery without being caught
</p>
<p>in its traps.
</p>
<p>I do not hesitate to state as my belief, based upon
</p>
<p>unusual facilities for judgment, that there is not at pres-
</p>
<p>ent a system in navy yards sufficiently protective against
</p>
<p>short weights and measures.
</p>
<p>Doors are open which should be closed and doubly locked.
</p>
<p>There are means for the perpetration of this wrong,
</p>
<p>without and beyond the knowledge of the naval store-
</p>
<p>keeper, who may be honest meanwhile in the exercise
</p>
<p>of his functions. I am aware this is an important state-
</p>
<p>ment. It is made in full conviction of its importance

</p>
<p>and its truth.
</p>
<p>21
</p>
<p>It must be entirely practicable to remedy all exposure
</p>
<p>to this evil, and, through enterprise and ingenuity, not
</p>
<p>only to devise an effective system of protection against
</p>
<p>fraud in the delivery of merchandise, but to insure its
</p>
<p>faithful execution.

<p>Hi % H: Hi Hi
</p>
<p>The Bank of England, in its internal admiidstration,
</p>
<p>is like an apartment walled with mirrors ; each action
</p>
<p>therein is reflected in various directions to the observa-
</p>
<p>tion of others, as honest or dishonest.
</p>
<p>When the Navy Department is developed upon so vast
</p>
<p>a scale as to require an appropriation of $140,000,000,
</p>
<p>like precision in system will be required to afford pro-
</p>
<p>tection to government. As additional security to the
</p>
<p>present system, I venture the suggestion that there should
</p>
<p>be in every navy yard a naval store receiver, as well as naval
</p>
<p>storekeeper.
</p>
<p>Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi
</p>
<p>When such reforms as these, above detailed, are ap-
</p>
<p>plied in the administration of the bureaus and at the
</p>
<p>yards, it will be difficult to show objections to a contract
</p>
<p>system, or opportunities for fraud in purchases by either
</p>
<p>contract or open purchase.
</p>
<p>It is possible that the suggestions herein submitted
</p>
<p>may be regarded as intrusive by some to whose official
</p>
<p>functions they have special relation.
</p>
<p>Yet it may without presumption be assumed that the
</p>
<p>business transactions with the department of the house
</p>
<p>of which the writer is a member, amounting to more
</p>
<p>than a million of dollars, and demanding of him during
</p>
<p>two years almost daily visitation of the workshops and
</p>
<p>offices of the navy yard, involving the supply of a great
</p>
<p>variety of articles entering into consumption and use

<p>board, ought to have furnished to a merchant facilities
</p>
<p>22
</p>
<p>for judgment as to the system in practice entitled to
</p>
<p>some consideration.
</p>
<p>Faithful officers of the government who would vigi-
</p>
<p>lantly guard its interests and exact its claims will invite
</p>
<p>the thorough scrutiny and welcome the respectful sug-
</p>
<p>gestion of citizens, as zealous as themselves for the wel-
</p>
<p>fare of government, and contributing, perhaps, as much
</p>
<p>to its support.
</p>
<p>An ex-President of the United States has said: "It is
</p>
<p>a condition for the enjoyment of liberty that our rulers
</p>
<p>be narrowly watched. It can never be long preserved
</p>
<p>without popular jealousy. It is a maxim of despots
</p>
<p>that the people should never inquire into the concerns
</p>
<p>of government."
</p>
<p>Transactions with government have been subject to
</p>
<p>such general suspicion that merchants sensitive to their
</p>
<p>good name are reluctant to engage in them, exposing
</p>
<p>themselves to disparagement and scandal. Yet shall
</p>
<p>those of the mercantile community who would maintain
</p>
<p>their own integrity abandon the competition ? Or shall
</p>
<p>they enter the lists, to strive against temptation to
</p>
<p>themselves and for its removal from others ?
</p>
<p>The case seems to be this : rogues, as may be expected,
</p>
<p>approach government for business. Executive officers
</p>
<p>are not sufficiently expert for their detection; therefore,
</p>
<p>all who solicit government patronage are under distrust
</p>
<p>and suspicion.
</p>
<p>Again : it is not through the dereliction of citizen con-
</p>
<p>tractors alone that government may be defrauded.
</p>
<p>Evidence is on record that government employes, either by
</p>
<p>mal-intent or through inadvertence, have been as greatly
</p>
<p>in fault. Results may be known outside of government
</p>
<p>offices which are individual secrets within them.

<p>While, in compliance with your request, and under

<p>impression of the importance of the subject, I have
</p>
<p>frankly advocated amendment in details of administra-

<p>tion, it has been without the least impulse of disrespect

<p>for oflB.cers of the government or the disparagement of

<p>their services ; but for a record against evils from which,

<p>the business world believes our government to receive
</p>
<p>material injury.
</p>
<p>We improved the earliest opportunity after appre-
</p>
<p>hending the evils of the contract system (in 1861) to
</p>
<p>expose them to the department, remarking, "We shall

</p>
<p>Committees on Naval Affairs of the Senate and House of Repre-
</p>
<p>sentatives.]
</p>
<p>Boston, January 29, 1864.
</p>
<p>To the Hon. the Secretary of the Navy:
</p>
<p>Sir : In the communication to the commissioner of the
</p>
<p>naval code, copy of which I had the honor to address to
</p>
<p>you on the 29th ultimo, reference was made to tho
</p>
<p>erroneous computations and enormous prices of certain
</p>
<p>contracts by which it was believed that the goverment
</p>
<p>had suffered loss.
</p>
<p>At that time the statement was fully warranted upon
</p>
<p>the personal knowledge of the writer. The suggestion
</p>
<p>of the existence of such wrong to the department was
</p>
<p>supposed by him to be the entire fulfilment of his duty.
</p>
<p>Facts which have subsequently been made public com-
</p>
<p>pel him now, in faithfulness to the country and to himself,,
</p>
<p>to place before you a more distinct statement of the
</p>
<p>case.
</p>
<p>The Boston Journal recently published a copy of one
</p>
<p>of these suspicious contracts  that, wherein $150 per

<p>dozen. The writer of that article proceeds to explain
</p>
<p>25
</p>
<p>the transaction, "in justice to the Navy Department,"
</p>
<p>as attributable to the system (formerly existing under
</p>
<p>law of 1885) of bidding at high prices and low prices,
</p>
<p>according to the quantities likely to be required. This
</p>
<p>theory was probably accepted from the speech of Senator
</p>
<p>Grimes (Cong. Globe, Jan. 9) but is altogether erroneous ;
</p>
<p>since all the prices were exorbitant, and the quantities
</p>
<p>limited under the act of March, 1863.
</p>
<p>It was also asserted that the bid was a fair specimen
</p>
<p>of the bids for every contract ; when, in fact, the con-
</p>
<p>tract mentioned (and others on record as bad) is ex-
</p>
<p>ceptional, extraordinary, and must have had a peculiar
</p>
<p>history.
</p>
<p>ih iii Hi Hi Hi
</p>
<p>Some contracts have appeared in the reports of the
</p>
<p>Ibureaus of an unprecedented character. The only ex-
</p>
<p>planation for them yet made to the public is incorrect ;
</p>
<p>in fact, their peculiar history is as yet a secret. In the
</p>
<p>absence of authentic statements, false and exaggerated
</p>
<p>theories are applied; scandal becomes excessive and
</p>
<p>Avide-spread. Suppressio veri, suggestio falsi.
</p>
<p>It is especially unjust that merchants who have had
</p>
<p>no part in wrongful acts should be defamed in mass with
</p>
<p>those who have committed them. If obloquy is to be
</p>
<p>scattered broadcast over all concerned with government,
</p>
<p>because of the dishonor of individuals ; if integrity is
</p>
<p>not to be recognized when found, and vindicated from
</p>
<p>undeserved suspicion and reproach, the business of the
</p>
<p>nation will be yielded entirely to those who care not for
</p>
<p>reputation, having none to defend.
</p>
<p>We are not willing to share with others, in the least
</p>
<p>degree, the imputations of wrong in our relations to
</p>
<p>government, but will rather make an effort to place the

<p>26
</p>
<p>Upon our first movement for navy business, in 1861,
</p>
<p>we were repelled by records of the absurd bargains pub-
</p>
<p>lished in the reports of previous years. We were obliged
</p>
<p>to follow precedents established under the law, or retire
</p>
<p>from the competition. The evils existing could only be
</p>
<p>apprehended by tracking them over forbidding ground.
</p>
<p>We vigorously joined in the raid upon them, by which
</p>
<p>the most prominent of those evils were remedied.
</p>
<p>During the period when contracts could only be ob-
</p>
<p>tained by calculation as to quantities instead of values of
</p>
<p>merchandise, and consequently by bids of anomalous
</p>
<p>prices, we improved an opportunity to demonstrate by
</p>
<p>figures to the Bureau of Yards and Docks that the aver-
</p>
<p>age per cent, of profit to us did not exceed or equal a
</p>
<p>fair mercantile rate. We invite, and will aid in like
</p>
<p>manner, the utmost scrutiny of all our transactions with
</p>
<p>the department.
</p>
<p>The files of the bureaus, and the testimony of members
</p>
<p>of Congress from Massachusetts, will witness that we
</p>
<p>have advocated the remedy of abuses at once upon their
</p>
<p>discovery. The following pages will discover an onerous
</p>
<p>task assumed in this service.

<p>With this letter, Mr. Smith's pamphlet was presented

<p>to the Secretary of the Navy, in person, and in company
</p>
<p>with Hon. A. H. Rice, of Massachusetts. It was subse-
</p>
<p>quently printed in full in the Report of the Select Com-
</p>
<p>mittee on Naval Supplies of the U. S. Senate, July 4,
</p>
<p>1864, and quoted by Hon. John P. Hale in his speech in
</p>
<p>the Senate, in defence of the Report.
</p>
<p>The pamphlet was a mathematical analysis of certain

<p>contracts, covering thirty-eight pages, and with the an-

<p>loss to government, all apply to the aw^ards under ad-

</p>
<p>Awards in June.
</p>
<p>On the morning of the 24th of June, 1863, the Secre-
</p>
<p>tary of the Navy, acting upon special warning from
</p>
<p>Senator Sumner,* took measures for the protection of an
</p>
<p>opening of bids to be made that day. Several mercan-
</p>
<p>tile houses of Boston were by mutual arrangement rep-
</p>
<p>resented on the occasion. The opening was, according
</p>
<p>to their request, prosecuted through a continuous sitting.

</p>
<p>" 3. This inquiry into this subject of naval contracts
</p>
<p>mainly arose upon an exposition of them by Franklin
</p>
<p>W. Smith, a merchant of Boston, and the evidence and
</p>
<p>papers herewith reported will show the thoroughness
</p>
<p>and ability with which his examination was made, and
</p>
<p>the particular replies on the different points given thereto
</p>
<p>on behalf of the department. The recriminations against
</p>
<p>him appear in the replies and in the testimony taken
</p>
<p>before the committee. There can be no question of his
</p>
<p>intelligence and capacity, nor would it be unreasonable
</p>
<p>to assert that the public are indebted to him for much
</p>
<p>of valuable information upon the subjects covered by
</p>
<p>this investigation. Since his examination before the
</p>
<p>committee, he has been arrested at Boston, it is believed
</p>
<p>at the instance of the Navy Department, upon some
</p>
<p>accusation or allegation of over-charge or imposition in
</p>
<p>furnishing naval supplies. It is to be hoped, for the
</p>
<p>credit of the government, that this arrest, following close
</p>
<p>upon his examination before the committee, will be fully
</p>
<p>justified upon due investigation and fair trial, and that

<p>the proceeding will be relieved from all appearance of
</p>
<p>persecution or vengeance."

</p>
<p>A Preliminary Assault op the Navy Department^
</p>
<p>IN THE U. S. Senate.
</p>
<p>On the 23rd of May, 1864, the Senator from Iowa
</p>
<p>spoke at length in reply to an adverse report by the Com-
</p>
<p>mittee on Naval Supplies, upon a proposition from the
</p>
<p>Navy Department, that purchases should be made by
</p>
<p>regular officers of the Navy, instead of Navy agents who
</p>
<p>were civilians.
</p>
<p>Extract from Correspondence of the Boston Daily
</p>
<p>Advertiser, June 8, 1864.
</p>
<p>" Our readers will observe that the Senator singled
</p>
<p>" out Mr." Franklin W. Smith of Smith Brothers & Co.,
</p>
<p>" for his severest denunciation. In doing this the Sena-
</p>
<p>" tor did great injustice to the house in question. As to
</p>
<p>" the injustice, we will call attention to the letter by Mr.
</p>
<p>" Franklin W. Smith, embodied in Mr. Hale's reply,
</p>
<p>" which, we believe, supplies a complete answer to the
</p>
<p>" substance of the charges made by Mr. Grimes.
</p>
<p>" It is proper to add that, at the close of the debate,
</p>
<p>" Mr. Sumner rose to express his confidence in the en-
</p>
<p>" tire good faith with which the Messrs. Smith had dealt
</p>
<p>" with the government.
</p>
<p>" Nearly the whole Massachusetts' delegation in both
</p>
<p>" Houses, we believe, would have joined in this expres-
</p>
<p>" sion ; and one member, himself a merchant of high
</p>
<p>" standing in this city, who knows their course thor-
</p>
<p>" oughly, has said that not only have their transactions
</p>
<p>" been honorable and executed faithfully, but that they
</p>
<p>" have labored diligently to break up that system of
</p>
<p>" awarding contracts which has been the source of so much
</p>
<p>" fraudulent dealing with the government. It is, indeed

</p>
<p>" the fact, we believe, that Mr. Franklin W. Smith has
</p>
<p>35
</p>
<p>** acted as a zealous reformer in this matter, and is now
</p>
<p>" meeting the reformer's customary reward, after having
</p>
<p>" been largely instrumental in overturning the old sys-
</p>
<p>^' tem of fictitious bidding."
</p>
<p>In proof of the vindictive character of this attack, the
</p>
<p>following fact is stated. Having heard that it was in-
</p>
<p>tended, Mr. F. W. Smith, with his brother, and partner
</p>
<p>Mr. Benjamin Gr. Smith, met the Senator from Iowa in
</p>
<p>the Senate ante-chamber and placed with him copies of
</p>
<p>the printed correspondence of F.W. Smith with the Secre-
</p>
<p>tary of the Navy and Chiefs of Bureaus, herein above
</p>
<p>cited, in advocacy of the reform which he finally accom-
</p>
<p>plished, calling the Senator's attention to their date as
</p>
<p>early as February, 1862, and before the completion of
</p>
<p>their first contract. Yet with this correspondence in his
</p>
<p>hands, the Senator insinuated to the contrary, by an in-
</p>
<p>terrogation in his speech : " Did they ever address the
</p>
<p>Department on the subject ? "
</p>
<p>Hon. John P. Hale replied at once in support of the
</p>
<p>Keport of the Naval Committee, and in vindication of
</p>
<p>Mr. Smith.
</p>
<p>Extracts from Speech of Hon. John P. Hale, of New
</p>
<p>Hampshire, in the United States Senate, May
</p>
<p>23, 1864 (as follows) :

<p>*'A great portion of the labor of this effort of the Sena-
</p>
<p>tor is made upon Mr. Smith, of the firm of Smith Brothers
</p>

</p>
<p>him ; he is a merchant of the highest character ; of un-
</p>
<p>impeachable integrity, and unblemished reputation with
</p>
<p>all who know him. There is not a mercantile house in
</p>
<p>Boston, and that is a place, I think, where the standard

</p>
<p>of mercantile integrity is as high as it is in any city of
</p>
<p>36
</p>
<p>this Union  there is not a mercantile house nor a mer-
</p>
<p>cantile man in Boston whose reputation, excels that of
</p>
<p>Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith is not only a man eminent in the
</p>
<p>walks of mercantile and private life, of unspotted integ-
</p>
<p>rity, and of unsuspected fairness, but, beside all that,
</p>
<p>he is an able man ; he is a keen man as well as an honest
</p>
<p>man ; and do you want to know the secret of this hostility
</p>
<p>to Mr. Smith ?* I have it in my hand here now (holding
</p>
<p>up the pamphlets of Mr. Franklin W. Smith)."
</p>
<p>"When the report of the Secretary of the Navy commu-
</p>
<p>nicated to the two Houses of Congress, on the 7th of De-
</p>
<p>cember last, w^as published, Mr. Smith saw, as every
</p>
<p>man can see that will look at it, evidence of the grossest
</p>
<p>and most outrageous frauds under the published evi-
</p>
<p>dence of the Secretary of the Navy  not one of them
</p>
<p>perpetrated through the agency of the Navy agents. As
</p>
<p>became a man of integrity and of keen intellect, he, in a
</p>
<p>little pamphlet which I hold in my hand, exposed some
</p>
<p>of these frauds perpetrated, not through Navy agents,
</p>
<p>but through officials here at Washington. He exposed
</p>
<p>them in his pamphlet. Let me call your attention to
</p>
<p>one or two of them."
</p>
<p>(The contracts cited and the details of wrong and loss
</p>
<p>exposed can be found in the official report of the debate.)
</p>
<p>* ^ i^ ifc if:
</p>
<p>" Mr. Smith brought these facts to light and published
</p>
<p>them, and for it he is entitled to the thanks of every man
</p>
<p>who desires purity in the administration of the govern-
</p>
<p>ment. Instead of it he has received and secured to him-
</p>
<p>self, and probably to his children after him, the undying
</p>
<p>hatred of the men whose conduct is thus implicated."
</p>
<p>* Quotation of these personal allusions to the defendant -will be
</p>
<p>pardoned in view of the malig-nant disparagement which they

<p>would counteract. The g-entle proprieties of ordinary life are

</p>
<p>Mr. Smith's Vindication.
</p>
<p>*'Again, Mr. Smith has not only exposed these wrongs,
</p>
<p>but he has been guilty of another gross offense in the
</p>
<p>view of the heads of these bureaus. When his attention
</p>
<p>was first called to this subject of fictitious bidding, he
</p>
<p>looked back to years ago when it went on quietly year
</p>
<p>after year; and not a word was said against it ; but the
</p>
<p>very first year Mr. Smith's attention was called to it he
</p>
<p>did what the Senator said he ought to have done ; he noti-
</p>
<p>fied the heads of bureaus and the Secretary of the Navy
</p>
<p>of these frauds by correspondence. He had correspond-
</p>
<p>ence, too, with the gentleman appointed to prepare a
</p>
<p>naval code, and made a suggestion of the very frauds
</p>
<p>that had been practiced, and the mode in which they
</p>
<p>might be practiced ; and for that, too, he has committed,
</p>
<p>in the eyes of this gentleman, an unpardonable sin."
</p>
<p>" I have said that Mr. Smith is not only an honest man,
</p>
<p>but he is a keen man. I do not know that I shall be
</p>
<p>doing any injustice to the Senator from Iowa  I certainly
</p>
<p>do not mean to do any  if I say to the Senator from Iowa
</p>
<p>that he is quite as keen a man as he is, and I think he
</p>
<p>is a little keener in one respect. The Senator from
</p>
<p>Iowa  I do not mean to say anything unkind or disre-
</p>
<p>spectful to him  is charged and surcharged with the
</p>
<p>concentrated venom of all the men that Mr. Smith has
</p>
<p>disturbed by writing this pamphlet, and he has been so
</p>
<p>highly charged that he let some of it off before he
</p>
<p>made his speech here, as I think the Senator will see
</p>
<p>when I read, as I propose to read, Mr. Smith's answer
</p>
<p>to the speech of the gentleman, made before the speech
</p>
<p>was delivered. I will read it."

</p>
<p>38
</p>
<p>from Iowa, which is on record in the report of the de-
</p>
<p>bate. It closed as follows :
</p>
<p>" We hope that our efforts in behalf of reform, our
</p>
<p>fearless assertion of our rights as merchants in corres-
</p>
<p>pondence with heads of bureaus, and our exposure of
</p>
<p>collusion and fraud, have not stimulated an eager search
</p>
<p>for wrong on our part which has no existence in fact,
</p>
<p>and thus called down upon us an unfriendly criticism.

</p>
<p>" Hon. John P. Hale,
</p>
<p>" Chairman of Senate Committee on Naval Affairs ^
</p>
<p>Mr. Hale continued :
</p>
<p>" Mr. President, I have read tKis long communication
</p>
<p>to the Senate because I thought it due to a gentleman
</p>
<p>whose character was thus assailed, and, I think, as it
</p>
<p>will be published side by side with the statements of
</p>
<p>the Senator from Iowa, that the injurious imputations
</p>
<p>thrown upon the character of Mr. Smith will carry with
</p>
<p>them their own antidote. I believe there is no higher
</p>
<p>duty that a Senator or the Senate owes to the country,
</p>

<p>Smith Brothers were followed in vain.
</p>

</p>
<p>But at these inimical and despotic appliances F. W.
</p>
<p>Smith was alarmed. He wrote to Messrs. A. H. Rice
</p>
<p>and D. "W. Gooch, Representatives from Massachusetts,.
</p>
<p>and to Senator Wilson, in terms as follows

<p>Boston, April 6, 1864.

<p>Dear Sir  While I was in Washington a Col. Olcott

<p>step shall be taken to our injury, until I have seen the-
</p>
<p>statements that may be gathered against us, and had

</p>
<p>^ * Hi H: H:
</p>
<p>" Dear Sir  Smith Brothers invite the utmost scru-
</p>
<p>tiny, fairly conducted.
</p>
<p>" Yet they have incurred the dislike of certain bu-
</p>
<p>reaus. The reasons will be found in the accompanying
</p>
<p>pamphlets. ^ ^ My present purpose is to
</p>
<p>elicit a perusal of the enclosed papers, that you may
</p>
<p>read our record, and to bespeak your decided effort

<p>against any such injustice as the use of ex-parte, secret
</p>
<p>evidence gathered against us before we have had any
</p>
<p>opportunity for a hearing."
</p>
<p>To the remonstrances of these gentlemen Secretary
</p>
<p>Wells gave assurance of due fairness. But the inquisi-
</p>
<p>tion continued. After the Secretary was informed that
</p>
<p>Mr. Smith had not been summoned, which he had
</p>
<p>claimed as a right ; a notice was sent to him to appear.
</p>
<p>Thirty minutes onlyAvere allowed him in answer to gen-
</p>
<p>eral inquiries, when he w^as dismissed. Merchants,
</p>
<p>friends of Messrs. Smith, who testified to their integrity,
</p>
<p>were, like himself, never asked to complete or sign their
</p>
<p>testimony ; while threats and false entries were employed
</p>
<p>with workmen in the Navy Yard, and others, to work up
</p>
<p>affidavits against them.*
</p>
<p>The raid upon Smith Brothers continued ; and in in-
</p>
<p>creased alarm, F.W. Smith went to Washington. In com-
</p>
<p>pany with Hon. A. H. Rice, he received assurance from
</p>
<p>Secretary Wells, " that no measures should he taken against
</p>
<p>the firm until opportunity had been given for explanation''
</p>
<p>Upon this pledge of the honor of the Secretary, Mr.

<p>Smith rested in confidence until its ruthless and abso-
</p>
<p>lute violation.

</p>
<p>42
</p>
<p>On the 17th of June, 1864 (anniversary of the battle
</p>
<p>of Bunker Hill, when the business centers were de-
</p>
<p>serted) ; three months after the coming of the inquisition
</p>
<p>to Boston, Smith Brothers were arrested upon a military-
</p>
<p>order from General Dix at New York, upon the demand
</p>
<p>of Gideon Welles, and were sent to Fort Warren.
</p>
<p>Then a detachment of marines took possession of their
</p>
<p>warehouse. Their safe was forced, and all books and
</p>
<p>papers seized. Soldiers invaded the home of Franklin
</p>
<p>W. Smith, broke locks, and purloined all papers, even
</p>
<p>correspondence of deceased relatives.
</p>
<p>These proceedings aroused indignation in Boston and
</p>
<p>Washington.
</p>
<p>From the Boston Journal.
</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch ]
</p>
<p>" There is intense feeling in Washington among Mas-
</p>
<p>sachusetts men respecting the arrest of Smith Brothers,
</p>
<p>of Boston. , The Congressional State delegation had a
</p>
<p>meeting on the subject. They waited upon Secretary
</p>
<p>Welles ; but got few promises  none, in lact.

</p>
<p>Editorial from the Boston Post, June 18th.
</p>
<p>" For some time past a Select Committee, appointed
</p>
<p>by authorities at Washington, have been investigating
</p>
<p>matters connected with navy contracts at this port, and
</p>
<p>as a result of their investigations, two members of the

</p>
<p>to Fort Warren.
</p>
<p>43
</p>
<p>" Mr. Franklin W. Smith, the senior member of the
</p>
<p>firm, has been in business in this city for many years,
</p>
<p>and no firm stands higher than his, in the confidence of
</p>
<p>the community. The transactions of Mr. Smith with the
</p>
<p>government commenced some three years ago, since
</p>
<p>which time his firm has been almost exclusively engaged
</p>
<p>in furnishing Naval Supplies under contracts. We are
</p>
<p>informed that the prices paid for supplies which they
</p>
<p>have furnished, as appears by official reports, have been
</p>
<p>more favorable to the government than those paid at
</p>
<p>any other yard. There would seem to be no chance,
</p>
<p>therefore, for any swindle."
</p>
<p>" Some two years ago, Mr. Franklin "W. Smith, the
</p>
<p>senior member of the firm, in a series of letters to the
</p>
<p>Navy Department, exposed the manner in which the
</p>
<p>government had been grossly swindled under Navy con-
</p>
<p>tracts, and recommended a change in the system of
</p>
<p>making these contracts. The reform was made by Con-
</p>
<p>gress, upon his suggestion. By his fearless exposure of
</p>
<p>these abuses, he gained the enmity of swindling con-
</p>
<p>tractors and of parties in the Bureau of the Navy De-
</p>
<p>partment, whose collusion with these contractors was
</p>
<p>more than suspected. The impression among the friends
</p>
<p>of Mr. Smith who know these facts is, that the proceed-
</p>
<p>ings against him are 'purely malicious r
</p>
<p>To paralyze public sympathy by indications of serious
</p>
<p>allegations against the Smiths when no charges what-
</p>
<p>ever had been presented, as required by law ; bail to
</p>
<p>the amount of $500,000 was demanded. Immediately
</p>
<p>it was telegraphed that $1,000,000 would be offered;
</p>
<p>and within twenty-four hours that amount was tendered
</p>
<p>by indignant citizens of Boston. When it was seen

</p>
<p>that the ruse to carry public condemnation by storm
</p>
<p>44
</p>
<p>had miscarried and recoiled, it was wired from the
</p>
<p>Navy Department that a bond of $20,000 would suffice.
</p>
<p>Upon this. Smith Brothers returned at once to Boston,
</p>
<p>after most courteous and hospitable treatment in the
</p>
<p>fort by Col. Dimock, the commandant. He said that
</p>
<p>he had no precedent for detention of merchants in a
</p>
<p>fortress, and therefore installed them in quarters adjoin-
</p>
<p>ing his own; shared with them his table, and gave
</p>
<p>them the range of the fortification and island.
</p>
<p>But while they were quickly released through the en-
</p>
<p>ergy of Massachusetts Congressmen and their fellow-
</p>
<p>citizens, their books and papers were sent to Philadel-
</p>
<p>phia, where, as was proved, charges were manufactured
</p>
<p>therefrom to make grounds for an arrest which had
</p>
<p>been made without shadow of reason, and in utter viola-
</p>
<p>tion of the *' Rules and Regulations" provided for mili-
</p>
<p>tary arrests, above quoted.
</p>
<p>It was not until the 11th of August, 1864, two months
</p>
<p>later, that '' charges and specifications" were addressed
</p>
<p>to F. W. Smith at the department.
</p>
<p>These charges did not involve a loss of above $500
</p>
<p>in the aggregate on four different specifications. Sub-
</p>
<p>sequently another allegation of $2,000 damage upon
</p>
<p>a sale of pig iron (on which the government made a sav-
</p>
<p>ing of $30,000 in value before delivery) was added ; but
</p>
<p>this count was at once abandoned by the court.
</p>
<p>In the Report of the committee of the Boston Board
</p>
<p>of Trade in review of the case occurs the following sum-
</p>
<p>mary of these charges :
</p>
<p>" In a word, your committee do not hesitate to express
</p>
<p>the opinion that an importer of the different kinds of tin,
</p>
<p>a dealer in foreign and domestic iron, and an importer of
</p>
<p>hardware, acting as refeo-ees, for a trifling fee, would have

</p>
<p>heard the case in ten or twelve hours, and haw made an
</p>
<p>45
</p>
<p>award satisfactory to the most respectable commercial houses
</p>
<p>in the United States and in Europe.
</p>
<p>" The transactions of Smith Brothers & Co. with the
</p>
<p>Navy Department amounted to about a million and a
</p>
<p>quarter of dollars ; and so numerous were the articles
</p>
<p>delivered that the entries of sales cover twelve hundred
</p>
<p>and five pages. We give a single instance of details.
</p>
<p>In a contract for the precise sum of $19,902.13, a witness
</p>
<p>for the prosecution estimated thus :
</p>
<p>251 articles upon different lines.
</p>
<p>12,564 single articles.
</p>
<p>171 barrels.
</p>
<p>53,509 pounds of articles asst'd.
</p>
<p>12,000 tallies.
</p>
<p>25d gross assorted.
</p>
<p>80,000 tacks and brads.
</p>
<p>6 sets of carpenters' tools.
</p>
<p>600 feet of chain.
</p>
<p>52 reams of paper.
</p>
<p>10 boxes of tin.
</p>
<p>64 iron girders.
</p>
<p>" Of these, alleged to be of inferior quality at the trial,
</p>
<p>were, 1 mason's hammer, 1 ratchet drill, 1 pair dividers,
</p>
<p>1 spirit level, 2 pickaxes, 1 drawing knife, 1 drill stock,
</p>
<p>1 dozen chisels, 1 sheet sand paper, 1 sickle, 1 hoe, 2
</p>
<p>shovels, 1 axe, 1 handsaw, 1 hammer, 5 manure forks, 1
</p>
<p>spade, 6 scythes, and 6 rakes.
</p>
<p>"In view of such facts, the charge of 'fraud,' or of
</p>
<p>fraudulent intention, is utterly frivolous. The wonder,
</p>
<p>indeed, is that, in so large a business, and in the condi-
</p>
<p>tion of the market since the beginning of the w^ar, the
</p>
<p>number of articles below the standard quality should be
</p>
<p>so very limited. Of the general good quality of the
</p>
<p>goods and wares sold and delivered, there can be no

</p>
<p>doubt. No less than ninety merchants and manufacturers,
</p>
<p>who sold goods to Smith Brothers & Co. to the amount nearly
</p>
<p>of one million of dollars, declare, in a paper which was trans-
</p>
<p>mitted to the late deeply lamented President of the United
</p>
<p>States, that having furnished that firm ^with merchandise at
</p>
<p>various times within the past three years, destined for the use
</p>
<p>46
</p>
<p>of the United States Navy Department, we hereby certify
</p>
<p>that we have in all cases sold and delivered to them such qual-
</p>
<p>ities as we believed would be entirely satisfactory to and fitted
</p>
<p>for the use of the Department, and such as we should have
</p>
<p>supplied had the order been made upon us directly by the
</p>
<p>Gfovernment.''
</p>
<p>" Frauds, cheatings, should show great gains. But
</p>
<p>your committee are satisfied, that this large, compli-
</p>
<p>cated and vexatious business was transacted for a very-
</p>
<p>moderate compensation. In the course of the trial, ' Mr.
</p>
<p>B. G. Smith testified that, upon as an exact approxima-
</p>
<p>tion as he had been able to make, the net profits left to
</p>
<p>Smith Brothers & Co., on the first of February, 1864,
</p>
<p>were about five per cent upon the amount of sales.'
</p>
<p>" Few merchants of reputation, as we venture to sug-
</p>
<p>gest, will be anxious hereafter to become ' contractors,'
</p>
<p>for twice or thrice five per cent profit, when, besides the
</p>
<p>notorious delays in payment, fines and Bastiles are in
</p>
<p>the prospective, for alleged default in the quality of a
</p>
<p>saw or of a hammer ; or because, owing to the operation
</p>
<p>of the tariff on importations from Europe of articles pro-
</p>
<p>duced east of the Cape of Good Hope, there is a differ-
</p>
<p>ence of two cents the pound in tins of about the same
</p>
<p>purity, and of the same intrinsic value ; ay, because
</p>
<p>Banca, not Revely, is ' nominated in the bond." '
</p>
<p>Accompanying the charges and specifications was an
</p>
<p>order to appear before a court-martial at Philadelphia.
</p>
<p>Then a delegation went to President Lincoln in remon-
</p>
<p>trance.
</p>
<p>This delegation comprised Senator Wilson of Massa-
</p>
<p>chusetts, Judge Thomas, and the late Hon. Wm. B.
</p>
<p>Spooner, one of the most eminent and philanthropic cit-

</p>
<p>izens of Boston. When Senator Wilson opened the case
</p>
<p>47
</p>
<p>President Lincoln replied : " I know all about it, Wilson;
</p>
<p>it is a fight between a department and a citizen, and
</p>
<p>the citizen has no fair show. I propose to quash the
</p>
<p>whole thing." "No," said the Senator, "we hope you
</p>
<p>will do no such thing. Smith Brothers wish ifc never to
</p>
<p>be said that this charge was fixed up through influence.
</p>
<p>They challenge the tight, but want protection against
</p>
<p>conspiracy and a court chosen by their enemies."
</p>
<p>" You are right," said the President, " go tell the
</p>
<p>Smiths I'd has leave be tried by the devil on a court-
</p>
<p>martial, as anybody else, if it can be looked up after-
</p>
<p>wards. Let them run their machine, and I will take it
</p>
<p>up when they are done."
</p>
<p>Despite the countermand, a second order was issued
</p>
<p>for the defendants to go to the court in Philadelphia.
</p>
<p>The delegation returned to the President, who sent for
</p>
<p>Secretary Welles and asked the reason. " We have no
</p>
<p>money," said he, " to pay expenses of sending the court
</p>
<p>to Boston." " I guess you can find some," said the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent. " Order the court to Boston.'" The trial subse-
</p>
<p>quently cost Smith Brothers twenty thousand dollars,
</p>
<p>and much more to the government.
</p>
<p>At length, in September, 1864, the Naval Court con-
</p>
<p>vened in the Navy Yard at Boston. It was composed
</p>
<p>of seven naval officers, retired for old age or incompe-
</p>
<p>tency on "half pay"; some of whom were noted on
</p>
<p>the Naval Register as "not recommended for promo-
</p>
<p>tion." These absolute judges of both law and fact
</p>
<p>were chosen by the accusers ; one of whom had been
</p>
<p>heard to say, "TTe constitute courts to convict.'"^ So long
</p>
<p>as their decisions suited the appointing power these
</p>
<p>superannuated officers received " full pay." If not satis-
</p>
<p>factory, they could be " relieved."

<p>Each page of testimony recorded in mammoth pen-
</p>
<p>manship paid the Judge Advocate a fee. It was piled
</p>
<p>up to an aggregate of 2,500 pages. Two judges advo-
</p>
<p>cate appeared before the close of the case. Four months
</p>
<p>were spent before the conclusion of the case by the
</p>
<p>court. On the 26th January, 1865, the President or-
</p>
<p>dered the record to be sent to him for examination after
</p>
<p>revision by counsel for the department, by whom all
</p>
<p>charges had been abandoned but that of $100, for a

<p>difference between Banca and Revely tin.

<p>REVIEW OP THE CASE.
</p>
<p>This paper with explanatory notes^ was prepared by
</p>
<p>Mr. Sumner for the ninth volumes of his " Works," the
</p>
<p>month before his death. He preceded it by the "Appeal
</p>
<p>of the Massachusetts Delegation in Congress to the
</p>
<p>President of the United States," written by himself.

<p>"The more I have examined this case, the more I have
</p>
<p>been surprised by the preliminary proceedings, the con-
</p>
<p>tinued prosecution, and the findings of the court. I can
</p>
<p>well understand how they were used in the House of
</p>
<p>Representatives as an argument for the total repeal of
</p>
<p>the Act of Congress authorizing the trial of civilians by
</p>
<p>courts-martial. Such a case must make us fear, that,
</p>
<p>under this Act, justice may be sacrificed. It might
</p>
<p>make honest merchants hesitate to enter into business
</p>
<p>relations with the Government."
</p>
<p>"On careful examination, it seems that the whole prose-
</p>
<p>cution, so far as proof is seriously pretended, is reduced
</p>
<p>to one single specification,  to wit, the sale and delivery
</p>
<p>of five thousand pounds of a tin called Revely, instead
</p>
<p>of a tin called Banca, by which, at most, the Government
</p>
<p>lost one hundred dollars."

<p>characteristic of his life.
</p>

</p>
<p>*'Look at this carefully, and the wonder increases that
</p>
<p>these proceedings were ever instituted."
</p>
<p>"1. The first remark to make is, that, even according
</p>
<p>to the finding of the Court, the Government has suffered
</p>
<p>only to the amount of one hundred dollars,  being the
</p>
<p>difference in price between the two kinds of tin at the
</p>
<p>date of delivery. The pettiness of this loss is still more
</p>
<p>apparent, when it is considered that the transactions of
</p>
<p>the respondents with the Government reached the sum
</p>
<p>of more than twelve hundred thousand dollars, having
</p>
<p>such infinite details that they covered twelve hundred
</p>
<p>and five pages of sales. Surely, on every principle of
</p>
<p>reason or evidence, the insignificance of this loss, in
</p>
<p>transactions on so large a scale, and extending over three
</p>
<p>years of time, constitutes an unanswerable presumption
</p>
<p>in favor of the respondents, excluding, as it does, any
</p>
<p>adequate motive for the perpetration of fraud. * *
</p>
<p>If a mountain in labor ever brought forth a mouse, it is this
</p>
<p>mountainous prosecution, whose only offspring yet crawling
</p>
<p>on earth is an allegation of loss to the United States of one
</p>
<p>hundred dollars ! But, if we look further at this transac-
</p>
<p>tion, it will he seen that it is absolutely unimpeachable.^
</p>
<p>" It appears that, according to extensive and long con-
</p>
<p>tinued usage, Revely is included under Banca ; that,
</p>
<p>according to usage at the Navy Yard, it was treated as
</p>
<p>Banca; that the whole transaction and the delivery
</p>
<p>were open and without any concealment ; that Revely
</p>
<p>was actually accepted by the officers of the government
</p>
<p>in performance of the contract; that the respondents
</p>
<p>never expected to supply other than Revely ; and lastly,
</p>
<p>that the prices paid shows that Revely was intended.
</p>
<p>Surely this is enough. I forbear to go into the evidence
</p>
<p>of founders and plumbers, derived from experience ; of

</p>
<p>51
</p>
<p>tins in question ; and also of business men as to their
</p>
<p>comparative value, for all this is superfluous. To charge
</p>
<p>fraud against the respondents under such circumstances is
</p>
<p>cruel, irrational, preposterous. Their conduct cannot he
</p>
<p>tortured or twisted into fraud. As well undertake to extract
</p>
<p>sunbeams out of cucumbers, or oil out of Massachusetts
</p>
<p>granite.
</p>
<p>" It is difficult to imagine the origin of these unfor-
</p>
<p>tunate proceedings, which, beginning in unexampled
</p>
<p>harshness, threaten to end in unexampled injustice, un-
</p>
<p>less arrested by the President. But there are certain
</p>
<p>facts which may shed light upon some of the hidden
</p>
<p>springs."

<p>"It appears that Franklin W. Smith, one of the re-
</p>
<p>spondents, published a pamphlet, in which he exposed
</p>
<p>abuses in the contract system in the Navy Department,
</p>
<p>and it is understood that sundry officials felt aggrieved
</p>
<p>by these disclosures. The spirit of these officials appears
</p>
<p>sufficiently in the following extract from a letter of one
</p>
<p>of the witnesses of the government, holding an impor-
</p>
<p>tant position in the Navy Department, addressed to an-
</p>
<p>other witness, himself an official also :
</p>
<p>" I HAVE BEEN SUMMONED BEFORE THE SeLECT COMMIT-
</p>
<p>TEE OF THE Senate for investigating frauds in naval

</p>
<p>plained that I have interfered with his business ;
</p>
<p>HE AND HIS FRIEND SmITH ARE DEAD COCKS IN THE

<p>" The writer of this letter, after appearing before the
</p>
<p>52
</p>
<p>Senate Committee at a later day, came on from Wash-
</p>
<p>ington to appear before the court-martial at Charles-
</p>
<p>town as a witness against the respondent, where he
</p>
<p>underwent a cross-examination on which I forbear to
</p>
<p>comment, if the prosecution did not originate in the
</p>
<p>spirit which fills his letter, it is evident that this spirit
</p>
<p>entered into it. ' IF THE WOOL DON'T FLY IT WON'T
</p>
<p>BE MY FAULT.' 'DEAD COCKS IN THE PIT.' *A SURE
</p>
<p>THING IN THE TIN BUSINESS.' Such are the counter-
</p>
<p>signs adopted by the agent of this dark proceeding,
</p>
<p>showing clearly two things : first, the foregone conclu-
</p>
<p>sion that these respondents were to be sacrificed ; and
</p>
<p>secondly, that the case turned on the * tin business.'
</p>
<p>" It is hard that citizens enjoying a good name, who
</p>
<p>had the misfortune to come into business relations with
</p>
<p>the government should be exposed to such a spirit;
</p>
<p>ii: Hi Hi Hi Hi
</p>
<p>that they should be obliged to undergo a protracted
</p>
<p>trial by court-martial, damaging their good name, de-
</p>
<p>stroying their peace, breaking up their business and
</p>
<p>subjecting them to untold expense, when at the slightest
</p>
<p>touch the whole case vanishes into thin air, leaving behind
</p>
<p>nothing but the incomprehensible spirit in which it had its
</p>
<p>origin.
</p>
<p>" Of course the finding and sentence of the. court
</p>
<p>ought, without delay, to be set aside. But this is only
</p>
<p>the beginning of justice. Some positive reparation
</p>
<p>should be made to citizens who have been so deeply
</p>
<p>injured.

</p>
<p>Interesting incidents of President Lincoln's Action
</p>
<p>APPENDED to THE OPINION BY Mr. 8uMNER FOR HIS
</p>
<p>Works.
</p>
<p>" The President promptly overruled the judgment and
</p>
<p>sentence. The result was received with manifestations
</p>
<p>of joy. The defendants, whose cruel prosecution had
</p>
<p>been protracted for six months, had an ovation in the
</p>
<p>congratulation of their friends and fellow-citizens.^
</p>
<p>Strangers at a distance, feeling that public liberty had
</p>
<p>suffered through them, sent their sympathy. The press
</p>
<p>gave expression to the prevailing sentiment. Nor was
</p>
<p>Mr. Sumner forgotten. The defendants made haste by
</p>
<p>telegraph to say : "Accept the lasting gratitude of Smith
</p>
<p>Brothers, their families, and their many friends." Others
</p>
<p>wrote in the same spirit  as, for instance, J. C. Hoadley,
</p>
<p>of New Bedford, who, though not knowing the sufferers,
</p>
<p>said: " I thank you, in the name of all fair dealing, for
</p>
<p>your opinion upon the case of Franklin W. Smith." From
</p>
<p>these expressions it appears that the effort of Mr. Sum-
</p>
<p>ner was regarded as not only a defence of the individual
</p>
<p>citizen, but a contribution to good government."
</p>
<p>" Independent of its character, this case has an inci-
</p>
<p>dental interest. It was one of the last, if not the last,
</p>
<p>having a personal relation, that ever occupied the mind
</p>
<p>of President Lincoln. His indorsement, overruling the
</p>
<p>judgment and sentence, bears date March 18th. This
</p>
<p>was Saturday. Meanwhile the Rebellion was about to
</p>
<p>fall, and the President left Washington, by boat, Thurs-
</p>
<p>day, March 23d, for City Point, the headquarters of the
</p>
<p>Army of Virginia, where he remained till after the sur-
</p>
<p>render of Richmond, returning to Washington Sunday
</p>
<p>evening, April 9th, and being assassinated Friday even-
</p>
<p>ing, April 14th."

<p>*V. Addenda VIII.
</p>
<p>54
</p>
<p>" Some circumstances associated with this case help
</p>
<p>exhibit the character of the President. They will be
</p>
<p>stated briefly. As soon as Mr. Sumner had prepared
</p>
<p>his Opinion, he hurried to the President. It was late in
</p>
<p>the afternoon, and the latter was about entering his car-
</p>
<p>riage for a drive, when Mr. Sumner arrived with the
</p>
<p>papers in his hand. He at once mentioned the result he
</p>
<p>had reached, and added that it was a case for instant
</p>
<p>action. The President proposed that he should return
</p>
<p>the next day, when he would consider it with him. Mr.
</p>
<p>Sumner rejoined, that, in his o'pinion, the President
</p>
<p>ought not to sleep on the case  that he should interfere
</p>
<p>promptly for the relief of innocent fellow-citizens  and
</p>
<p>urged that, if Abraham Lincoln had suffered unjust im-
</p>
<p>prisonment, an immense bill of expense, a trial by court-
</p>
<p>martial, and an unjust condemnation, he would cry out
</p>
<p>against any postponement of justice for a single day.
</p>
<p>The President, apparently impressed by Mr. Sumner's
</p>
<p>earnestness and his personal appeal, appointed eleven
</p>
<p>o'clock that evening, when he would go over the case,
</p>
<p>and hear Mr. Sumner's Opinion."
</p>
<p>" Accordingly, at eleven o'clock that evening, in the
</p>
<p>midst of a thunder-storm, filling the streets with- water,
</p>
<p>and threatening chimneys, Mr. Sumner made his way
</p>
<p>to the Presidential mansion. At the very hour named
</p>
<p>he was received, and at the request of the President pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to read his Opinion. The latter listened atten
</p>
<p>tively, with occasional comments, and at the close showed
</p>
<p>his sympathy with the respondents. It was now twenty
</p>
<p>minutes after midnight, when the President said that he
</p>
<p>would write his conclusion at once, and that Mr. Sumner
</p>
<p>must come and hear it the next morning  "when I open
</p>
<p>shop," said he. "And when do you open shop ? " Mr.

</p>
<p>Sumner inquired. "At nine o'clock," was the reply. At
</p>
<p>55
</p>
<p>that hour Mr. Sumner was in the office he had left after
</p>
<p>midnight, when the President came running in, and read
</p>
<p>at once the indorsement in his own handwriting, as
</p>
<p>follows :
</p>
<p>THE VINDICATION BY PRESIDENT LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>" I AM UNWILLING FOR THE SENTENCE TO STAND AND BE
</p>
<p>EXECUTED, TO ANY EXTENT, IN THIS CASE. In THE AB-
</p>
<p>SENCE OF A MORE ADEQUATE MOTIVE THAN THE EVIDENCE
</p>
<p>DISCLOSES, I AM WHOLLY UNABLE TO BELIEVE IN THE
</p>
<p>EXISTENCE OF CRIMINAL OR FRAUDULENT INTENT ON THE
</p>
<p>PART OF ONE OF SUCH W^ELL-ESTABLISHED GOOD CHARACTER.
</p>
<p>AS IS THE ACCUSED. If THE EVIDENCE WENT AS FAR
</p>
<p>TOWARD ESTABLISHING A GUILTY PROFIT OF ONE OR TWQ
</p>
<p>HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS, AS IT DOES OF ONE OR TWO
</p>
<p>HUNDRED DOLLARS, THE CASE WOULD, ON THE QUESTION OF
</p>
<p>GUILT, BEAR A FAR DIFFERENT ASPECT. ThAT ON THIS-
</p>
<p>CONTRACT, INVOLVING FROM ONE MILLION TO TWELVE HUN-
</p>
<p>DRED THOUSAND DOLLARS, THE CONTRACTORS SHOULD AT-
</p>
<p>TEMPT A FRAUD WHICH AT THE MOST COULD PROFIT THEM
</p>
<p>ONLY ONE OR TWO HUNDRED, OR EVEN ONE THOUSAND
</p>
<p>DOLLARS, IS TO MY MIND BEYOND THE POWER OF RATIONAL
</p>
<p>BELIEF. That they did not, in such a case, strike
</p>
<p>FOR GREATER GAINS PROVES THAT THEY DID NOT, WITH
</p>
<p>guilty OR FRAUDULENT INTENT, STRIKE AT ALL. ThE
</p>
<p>JUDGMENT AND SENTENCE ARE DISAPPROVED AND DE-
</p>
<p>CLARED NULL, AND THE ACCUSED ORDERED TO BE DIS-
</p>
<p>CHARGED.

<p>EXTRACTS FROM PUBLIC DOCUMENTS AND THE
</p>
<p>PRESS, 1864-1865.
</p>
<p>From the Speech op Hon. John P. Hale in the
</p>
<p>United States Senate, February, 1865.
</p>
<p>" There was a committee appointed by the Senate at the
</p>
<p>last session to investigate matters connected with naval
</p>
<p>supplies. The committee attended to that duty very
</p>
<p>laboriously ; and they laid some results before the Sen-
</p>
<p>ate and before the country which, I think, were most
</p>
<p>conclusive as to the existence of gross fraud. Well, sir,
</p>
<p>do you know what the result of that was ? One of the
</p>
<p>material witnesses in that case  one of the most respect-
</p>
<p>able men of Boston, who testified, and testified very
</p>
<p>fully, before that committee  pretty soon after he went
</p>
<p>home, was seized, his store seized, his papers seized,,
</p>
<p>his wife's papers seized ; and he was sent to a military
</p>
<p>fort, and ordered not to be released under a bail of
</p>
<p>$500,000, and was ordered to Philadelphia for trial.
</p>
<p>That was a little too strong even for the city of Boston,
</p>
<p>considering that, to render the thing more notorious, the
</p>
<p>arrest was made on the 17th of June."

<p>In reply to the question of Senator Davis, who asked,
</p>
<p>*' if the offence for which that gentleman was seized and
</p>
<p>imprisoned was merely that of giving in his testimony
</p>
<p>and his exposure of those frauds," Mr. Hale declared."
</p>
<p>"That is my opinion; but it was not the assigned
</p>
<p>cause. They ordered him, as I have said, to be con-
</p>
<p>fined in Fort Warren, and not to be released under
</p>
<p>$500,000 bail ; and he was ordered to Philadelphia for
</p>
<p>trial. This was a little too much for the loyal city of
</p>
<p>Boston ; and it created such indignation there that a
</p>
<p>delegation of citizens of Massachusetts  I think the
</p>
<p>honorable Senator on my left (Mr. Sumner) was one of
</p>
<p>them  represented this thing to the President; and
</p>
<p>the President countermanded the order for carrying a
</p>
<p>citizen of Massachusetts from Boston to Philadelphia
</p>
<p>for trial."
</p>
<p>H: H: H: ^ H:
</p>
<p>Speaking of courts-martial, Mr. Hale said, in the
</p>
<p>Senate : " And in that connection, I have a remarkable
</p>
<p>statement to make in regard to these tribunals. The
</p>
<p>man who ordered this outrageous arrest  the man who
</p>
<p>perpetrated this outrage in Boston  compared to which
</p>
<p>the proceedings of Turkey are civilized, and the Inqui-
</p>
<p>sition is a tender mercy  being remonstrated with, on
</p>
<p>another occasion, against sending these cases to naval
</p>
<p>and military courts-martial, and being asked why he
</p>
<p>did not take the ordinary courts, made this remarkable
</p>
<p>avowal: ^^ Tour civil courts are organized to acquit; we
</p>
<p>organize courts to convict!'' If there Avas some friend
</p>
<p>of the individual referred to here to deny it, without
</p>
<p>stirring out of my tracks, I would prove, by evidence
</p>
<p>that would flash conviction on every mind that heard it,
</p>
<p>that it is true as Holy Writ that this declaration was

</p>
<p>Speech of Hon. H. L. Dawes, March 2, 1865.
</p>
<p>" I understand from high authority in the Navy De-
</p>
<p>partment, that courts-martial are not organized, like
</p>
<p>courts of law, to guard the rights of the accused and
</p>
<p>secure justice, but are organized to convict."

</p>
<p>Still again, and referring to this very case : "I have
</p>
<p>in the last fortnight had the painful duty devolved upon
</p>
<p>me to read the proceedings of a court-martial under the
</p>
<p>law which I reported to the House some two years ago.
</p>
<p>It is one which, I venture to say, has hardly a parallel
</p>
<p>for the bitter malignity which seems to run through the
</p>
<p>whole proceedings, and for wider departure from old
</p>
<p>and established rules of law, of which the accused were

<p>the victims, and by which they were hunted, since the
</p>
<p>days of Jeffreys. It is the case of Smith Brothers of

</p>
<p>Editorial from the Boston Journal, February 14, 1865.
</p>
<p>" The case of the Smith Brothers, which has been on
</p>
<p>trial before a court-martial for several months past, is
</p>
<p>one which will now demand the attention and examina-
</p>
<p>tion of the public, and probably of the President and
</p>
<p>Congress. We doubt whether in the course of the war,
</p>
<p>individuals  citizens whose loyalty is unimpeached 
</p>
<p>have been more harshly dealt with, or more persistently
</p>
<p>and cruelly persecuted. All the constitutional and legal
</p>
<p>safe-guards which, under our Republican government,
</p>
<p>have been thrown around individual liberty, have in
</p>
<p>their case been broken down, and under no despotic
</p>
<p>government have those who have fallen under the ban
</p>
<p>of the ruling powers been more summarily dealt with,
</p>
<p>or held in a grasp of more relentless severity."
</p>
<p>:^ ifc ^ % :fr
</p>
<p>"The public will naturally inquire how and in what
</p>
<p>quarter this persecution originated? Two years ago
</p>
<p>Franklin W. Smith exposed and broke up an existing
</p>
<p>contract system which opened a wide door for frauds.
</p>
<p>In his illustrations of the working of the system it was
</p>
<p>shown that some of those employed in the bureaus of
</p>
<p>the Navy Department must have been in collusion with
</p>
<p>swindling contractors. From that time the persecution
</p>

<p>Editorial from Boston Daily Advertiser, March 21,
</p>
<p>1865.
</p>
<p>" The result of the great case of the Smith Brothers,
</p>
<p>naval contractors, charged with fraud, is at last before
</p>
<p>the public. After preliminary proceedings, which had
</p>
<p>seemed to point to disclosures of astounding magnitude,
</p>
<p>and after a thorough investigation of the business of
</p>
<p>the defendants, whose books and private papers were
</p>
<p>searched by experts for the materials for a prosecution,
</p>
<p>the charges brought against them finally settled down
</p>
<p>to an amount not much exceeding $2,000, while the
</p>
<p>charges relied upon against them scarcely reached the
</p>
<p>sum of $500." ^ Hi ^i The President has reviewed
</p>
<p>the case and has annulled the judgment, thus setting
</p>
<p>his condemnation not only upon this extraordinary sen-
</p>
<p>tence, but upon the judgment itself, by which, after their
</p>
<p>case had so shrunk from its original supposed dimen-
</p>
<p>sions, the accused were convicted at all. The upshot of
</p>
<p>the matter is, that after all the immense parade and
</p>
<p>excitement with which this case began, it turns out that
</p>
<p>there is nothing in it. The accused stand to-day not only
</p>
<p>free from all charges, but with evidence that after a
</p>
<p>searching examination of their course of business, no
</p>
<p>sound basis for charges could be found. They had, at
</p>
<p>the beginning, the confidence of the mercantile com-
</p>
<p>munity in which their lives have been passed ; they now
</p>
<p>have its indignant sympathy also."

<p>" The arrest of the Smith Brothers was made in June,
</p>
<p>1864. It was marked by every circumstance that could
</p>
<p>suggest the blackest criminality on their part. Had
</p>
<p>they been guilty of treason, the proceeding would have
</p>
<p>been deemed severe ; it would have been thought un-

</p>
<p>reasonable and even outrageous, had the charge been
</p>
<p>61
</p>
<p>murder." * * "And all this, as now only too certainly
</p>
<p>appears, was done upon a venture. Those instigating
</p>
<p>and responsible for the ]3roceedings, may have thought
</p>
<p>it likely that something of importance might thus be dis-
</p>
<p>covered, but they plainly had nothing of consequence to
</p>
<p>base their action upon. Every constitutional safeguard
</p>
<p>of personal rights  freedom from unreasonable searches
</p>
<p>and seizures and from excessive bail  was disregarded,
</p>
<p>not from any necessity, but to see what might come of
</p>
<p>it, and what disclosures might result from a blow thus
</p>
<p>struck at random. The whole unlimited authority with
</p>
<p>which the people have temxDorarily intrusted their gov-
</p>
<p>ernment to meet the terrible exigencies of civil war was
</p>
<p>put forth, and all, not only without necessity, but as it
</p>
<p>appears upon grounds which would not justify detention
</p>
<p>over night.
</p>
<p>" Upon these proceedings followed a tedious and costly
</p>
<p>trial, the amount involved in which would not pay for
</p>
<p>the printing necessarily done by the accused ; ten times
</p>
<p>the amount would not reimburse either government or
</p>
<p>accused for their expenses. And now upon a review of
</p>
<p>the case by a senator, whose pains-taking and love of
</p>
<p>justice displayed in this case do him the highest honor,
</p>
<p>and by the President, who will see the rebellion crashed
</p>
<p>but not innocent citizens, the case has been upset, and
</p>
<p>the accused have escaped from the tremendous blow,
</p>
<p>which was aimed at them. With less individual tenacity
</p>
<p>of purpose, less ample means at command and fewer
</p>
<p>friends, they could not have escaped, the whole power
</p>
<p>and authority of the United States being used against
</p>
<p>them  and what would then have been the record ? Two
</p>
<p>citizens destroyed, in fame and property, and  as the
</p>
<p>President has now decided  without just cause !

<p>Senator Sumner's Review of the Case of the

<p>Smith Brothers.
</p>
<p>We publish in the Supplement of this morning the
</p>
<p>able review, by Senator Sumner, of the case of Franklin
</p>
<p>W. Smith, which should be read by all who are interested
</p>
<p>in this extraordinary case. It will be seen by this paper
</p>
<p>that the case, when it left the Navy Department and
</p>
<p>was submitted to the President, had little left but the
</p>
<p>tin charge. The Court swept away some of the charges,
</p>
<p>and the Solicitor of the Navy Department, Mr. Eames,
</p>
<p>conceded that there was little or no basis for the others,
</p>
<p>except the tin charge. On that the prosecution fell back,

<p>any of the forms of civil law, their business broken up

<p>and a large portion of their property swept away
</p>
<p>involves the petty sum of |100 ! But even this charge
</p>
<p>is completely riddled by Mr. Sumner in his review, as
</p>
<p>it was effectually answered on the trial even by the
</p>
<p>testimony for the Government, a part of which Mr.
</p>
<p>Sumner quotes. As Mr. Sumner pointedly remarks, " at

<p>the slightest touch the whole case vanishes into thin air,

<p>leaving nothing behind but the incomprehensible spirit

<p>in which it had its origin."

</p>
<p>firm, became some years since, contractors for the supply

<p>of numerous classes of articles at the Charlestown Navy

<p>Yard, and had delivered merchandise to the amount of
</p>
<p>upwards of one million two hundred and fifty thousand
</p>
<p>dollars, when Col. Olcott stopped all transactions in the

<p>most summary manner. A detective inquisition was

<p>established that called before it more than one hundred

<p>Franklin W. Smith as a "Boston merchant," and to re-

<p>commend his retention or expulsion as a member of the

<p>able. And these nineteen hundred and thirteen pages

<p>have been perused with care, indeed more ; for we have

<p>in our possession upwards of eight hundred printed

<p>material facts or statements studied and mused upon,
</p>
<p>with single reference to forming a righteous "judgment"
</p>
<p>in the premises. Mention of the titles of this mass of

<p>that the "Charges and Specification of Charges pre-

<p>"Whoever reflects upon the record of the proceedings

<p>of the court-martial in the case before us  which, as we
</p>
<p>have once said, fill (1,913) one thousand nine hundred
</p>
<p>and thirteen manuscript pages  may wonder, possibly,
</p>
<p>that our Associate did not lose his understanding and

<p>well '  he for whom these rooms are draped in * suits of
</p>
<p>67
</p>
<p>solemn black ' ; he, the Chief Magistrate of the nation,
</p>
<p>interposed, and the convicted but innocent merchant
</p>
<p>became free  ^free !
</p>
<p>'' Bandaged eyes and even scales are the emblems of
</p>
<p>justice. Before a civil tribunal, State or Federal, our
</p>
<p>Associate would have been tried on a suit of contract by
</p>
<p>a judge of high legal attainments, who would have
</p>
<p>confined the evidence to the case ; and who would have de-
</p>
<p>cided to admit or reject testimony after arguments of counsel,
</p>
<p><xnd in the presence of hath parties to the issue. And, non-
</p>
<p>performance proved, the jury would have returned a
</p>
<p>Yerdict of damages in dollars and cents ; and (no ap-
</p>
<p>peal) here the matter would have terminated. Justice
</p>
<p>is even-handed between individuals, and should be so
</p>
<p>between governments and citizens. For the first time,
</p>
<p><and upon this point, we quote from Mr. Smith's * Re-
</p>
<p>view of the argument of the Judge Advocate,' thus :
</p>
<p>"The loss of interests to Smith Brothers & Co. has
</p>
<p>not been less than two per cent, upon their sales,
</p>
<p>through the delinquency of government payment ; or
</p>
<p>$25,000 on $1,250,000; although the early contracts
</p>
<p>stipulated that payments ' will he paid, by the Navy Agent
</p>
<p>within thirty days after bills, duly authenticated, shall
</p>
<p>have been presented to him.' "
</p>
<p>Again :
</p>
<p>" It required energy and caution to prevent these con-
</p>
<p>tracts from being disastrous. Many were abandoned
</p>
<p>by other parties on account of losses involved, and re-
</p>
<p>lief bills were passed by Congress for contractors ; but
</p>
<p>Smith Brothers & Co. strove to fulfill their contracts with
</p>
<p>the government (as with all men) up to the time of the
</p>
<p>violent proceedings against them  contracts on which the
</p>
<p><jdvance realized to the government was certainly not less than

<p>$200,000."
</p>
<p>68
</p>
<p>"The 'advance' was for the benefit of the country;
</p>
<p>but, on the other hand, the country should, as ' between
</p>
<p>man and man,' make good the ' loss,' whether much or
</p>
<p>little ; because the country is not entitled (in popular
</p>
<p>phrase) to ' both sides of the bargain.' The result, then,
</p>
<p>on this branch of our inquiry is, that on a question of
</p>
<p>contract, FRANKLIN W. SMITH, and not the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment, IS THE PARTY ENTITLED TO A VERDICT FOR
</p>
<p>DAMAGES.
</p>
<p>^ ^ i^ * *
</p>
<p>The report concludes as follows :
</p>
<p>" And now we append the ' Memorial of Senators and
</p>

<p>^'The celebrated case of Franklin W. Smith and
</p>
<p>brother was one of those which most largely helped to
</p>
<p>bring military tribunals into public contempt. Those
</p>
<p>two gentlemen were arrested and kept in confinement,
</p>
<p>their papers seized, their business destroyed, their repu-
</p>
<p>tation damaged, and a naval court-martial, ' organized
</p>
<p>to convict,' pursued them unrelentingly till a wiser and
</p>
<p>juster hand arrested the malice of their persecutors. It
</p>
<p>is known that President Lincoln, after full investigation
</p>
<p>of the case, annulled the whole proceedings, but it is
</p>
<p>remarkable that until this week the actual record of his
</p>
<p>decision could never be obtained from the Navy Depart-
</p>
<p>ment. An exact copy is still withheld, but the following
</p>
<p>was presented on Wednesday to the Boston Board of
</p>
<p>Trade as being very nearly the words of the late President:
</p>
<p>" Whereas, Franklin W. Smith had transactions with

</p>
<p>the Navy Department to the amount of one million and
</p>
<p>70
</p>
<p>a quarter of a million of dollars ; and, whereas, he had
</p>
<p>the chance to steal a quarter of a million, and was only-
</p>
<p>charged with stealing twenty-two hundred dollars  and
</p>
<p>the question now is about his stealing a hundred  I don't
</p>
<p>believe he stole anything at all. Therefore, the record
</p>
<p>and findings are disapproved  declared null and void,
</p>
<p>and the defendants are fully discharged." *
</p>
<p>"It would be difficult to sum up the rights and wrongs
</p>
<p>of the business more briefly than that, or to find a
</p>
<p>paragraph more characteristically and unmistakably
</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln's. The effect of the President's decision
</p>
<p>was not to pardon the Messrs. Smith  it was to make

<p>MEMORIAL OF SENATORS AND REPRESENTA-
</p>
<p>TIVES IN CONGRESS FROM MASS. TO THE
</p>
<p>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, CON-
</p>
<p>CERNING SMITH BROTHERS AND CO.; PRE-
</p>
<p>PARED BY HON. CHARLES SUMNER.
</p>
<p>TO THE PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES:
</p>
<p>The undersigned, Senators and Representatives in
</p>
<p>Congress from Massacliusetts, ask leave to call your
</p>
<p>serious attention to the proceedings initiated by the
</p>
<p>Navy Department against Benjamin G. Smith and
</p>
<p>Franklin W. Smith, of Boston, of the "firm of Smith
</p>
<p>Brothers & Co., a much respected firm, which has
</p>
<p>hitherto enjoyed the confidence, personal and mercan-
</p>
<p>tile, of the community where they reside. Among their
</p>
<p>neighbors and friends, these proceedings have already
</p>
<p>attracted much attention, and awakened corresponding
</p>
<p>feeling.
</p>
<p>The proceedings have seemed to be harsh, vindictive^

</p>
<p>and unnecessary :
</p>
<p>72
</p>
<p>(1.) In the character of the arrest of Messrs. Smithy
</p>
<p>which was attended by circumstances of severity utterljr
</p>
<p>unjustifiable.
</p>
<p>(2.) In requiring bonds to so large an amount as half
</p>
<p>a million of dollars. The fact that the parties in ques-
</p>
<p>tion easily obtained bonds for a much larger amount
</p>
<p>does not render this exaction of " excessive bail " less
</p>
<p>obnoxious to the requirements of the Constitution and
</p>
<p>of justice, or less indicative of the spirit in which these
</p>
<p>proceedings have been conducted.
</p>
<p>(3.) In the seizure of their books and papers, which
</p>
<p>are still detained, although regarded by their eminent-
</p>
<p>counsel as important to their defence.
</p>
<p>(4.) In turning into a military offence what is more^
</p>
<p>proper for a civil tribunal, and dragging these defend-
</p>
<p>ants before a court-martial.
</p>
<p>(5.) In transferring the proceedings from Boston,
</p>
<p>where the parties reside, and the transactions in question
</p>
<p>occurred, to Philadelphia ; thus increasing greatly the
</p>
<p>difficulties and the expense of the defence. This will be^
</p>
<p>appreciated when it is understood that the witnesses are
</p>
<p>very numerous, and chiefly engaged in mercantile busi-
</p>
<p>ness, so that they cannot leave Boston without the neglect,
</p>
<p>of their private interests.
</p>
<p>The undersigned, on reviewing these circumstances,
</p>
<p>which are so inconsistent with the administration of
</p>
<p>justice in its ordinary forms, have been at a loss to
</p>
<p>account for the spirit which has been manifested in the
</p>
<p>prosecution. If they look at the trivial character of most
</p>
<p>of the specifications against the defendants, they are still
</p>
<p>more at a loss. It is difficult to account for such elab-
</p>
<p>orate and persistent harshness, without yielding to the
</p>
<p>prevailing belief that other motives than the vindication

</p>
<p>of justice have entered into this case.
</p>
<p>73
</p>
<p>The undersigned are not strangers to the fact, that
</p>
<p>one of these defendants, in the discharge of what he be-
</p>
<p>lieved to be his duty as a good citizen, has, by corres-
</p>
<p>pondence and testimony before committees of Congress,
</p>
<p>been brought into collision with officers of the Navy De-
</p>
<p>partment ; and there is too much reason to believe, that
</p>
<p>some of these officers have allowed themselves to be gov-
</p>
<p>erned by personal feelings throughout these strange
</p>
<p>proceedings.
</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the undersigned most res-
</p>
<p>pectfully ask your assistance in securing justice to these
</p>
<p>defendants, according to the common course of proceed-
</p>
<p>ings at law. They are acquainted with the statute
</p>
<p>which provides court-martial for contractors in certain
</p>
<p>cases, and they are unwilling to make any suggestion
</p>
<p>which shall interfere with its efficiency ; but they have
</p>
<p>no hesitation in saying, that such a statute, which was
</p>
<p>intended for extreme cases, should not be applied to a
</p>
<p>case like the present, where, with a single exception, the
</p>
<p>questions are simply whether the defendants complied
</p>
<p>with their contract, and therefore, from their nature, can
</p>
<p>be better considered by the ordinary tribunals, accus-
</p>
<p>tomed to such questions, than by a naval tribunal com-
</p>
<p>posed of officers who have no familiarity with them.
</p>
<p>If the pending proceedings against the Messrs. Smith
</p>
<p>should be continued, there are two courses with regard
</p>
<p>to them which may be recommended :
</p>
<p>First, That they should be transferred at once to the
</p>
<p>United States Court in Massachusetts, and be placed
</p>
<p>under the direction of the learned Attorney of the United
</p>
<p>States for that district.
</p>
<p>Secondly, If the foregoing order is not deemed expe-
</p>
<p>dient, on the existing evidence, then a commission or

<p>commissioner might be appointed by the President to
</p>
<p>74
</p>
<p>inquire into the circumstances attending the arrest of
</p>
<p>the defendants, and also into the nature of the charges
</p>
<p>against them, in order to ascertain and report if there is
</p>
<p>any sufficient reason for the singular harshness to which
</p>
<p>they have been already subjected, and also for the ex-
</p>
<p>ceptional proceedings which have been instituted against
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>But for the sake of justice, and to relieve the G-overn-
</p>
<p>ment from all suspicion of undue harshness, the under-
</p>
<p>signed protest against the spirit in which these proceed-
</p>
<p>ings have been conducted, and appeal to you for such
</p>
<p>remedy as shall seem best ; to the end that the public
</p>
<p>interests may be adequately protected without any sacri-
</p>
<p>fice of the rights of the citizen, and without needless
</p>
<p>interference with the order of business.

<p>lieving that they have committed no offence of a criminal
</p>
<p>75
</p>
<p>or fraudulent character ; and that the proceedings which
</p>
<p>have been instituted against them are not only need-
</p>
<p>lessly severe, but they are especially objectionable, on
</p>
<p>the ground that they inflict upon them irreparable in-
</p>
<p>jury, before they have been found guilty of any crime.
</p>
<p>Measures so extraordinary and severe naturally give
</p>
<p>the impression that the Government esteems them guilty
</p>
<p>of extraordinary crimes; or else that the Government
</p>
<p>is using its authority and power, not for the protection,
</p>
<p>but for the destruction of private, individual immunities.

</p>
<p>FARTHER EVIDENCE OF THE "ORIGIN OF THESE
</p>
<p>UNFORTUNATE PROCEEDINGS" - IN THE MOR-
</p>
<p>TIFICATION AND REVENGE OF THE CHIEF OF
</p>
<p>THE BUREAU OF ORDNANCE OF THE U. S. NAVY
</p>
<p>DEPARTMENT.
</p>
<p>The hostility of this official had already been indi-
</p>
<p>cated, resulting from the overruling of his decision by
</p>
<p>the umpire in a matter of boiler iron. That settle-
</p>
<p>ment was effected on the 6th of February, 1864.
</p>
<p>. On the 25th of February, F. W. Smith was informed
</p>
<p>that this Chief of Bureau had asserted in his office in
</p>
<p>Washington that Smith Brothers had delivered Revely
</p>
<p>tin for Banca, and had offered to refund money; a
</p>
<p>charge which the firm immediately denied. The Chief
</p>
<p>replied, reiterating the charge and enclosing a voucher
</p>
<p>for 504| pounds Banca tin at 56 cents, alleging that it
</p>
<p>was Revely, and demanding a refund of money.
</p>
<p>Smith Brothers replied :
</p>
<p>"We claim this was Banca, as described. You offer
</p>
<p>"no proof, but merely assume to the contrary. Any
</p>
<p>"further claim for restitution by us must be accompa-

<p>" nied hy proof ihdii the articles were not as described.
</p>
<p>79
</p>
<p>Hi * "We called upon you to comply courteously
</p>
<p>" with your request for a copy of our paper upon * pur-
</p>
<p>" chases of naval supplies.' Conversation ensued, in-
</p>
<p>**itiated spiritedly by yourself, concerning the delivery
</p>
<p>"of Revely tin for Banc a, though you disclaimed any
</p>
<p>" insinuation upon Smith Brothers.
</p>
<p>"Yet a scandalous perversion of this conversation
</p>
<p>"quickly followed us upon our return. This experience
</p>
<p>" will forbid further communication in future with the
</p>
<p>" bureau, except by writing.
</p>
<p>"Is is appropriate to remark, under these circum-
</p>
<p>" stances, that the important relations of government
</p>
<p>" officers should keep them free from defamatory gossip ;
</p>
<p>" especially when it is known that it has been traced
</p>
<p>"from thence directly to the public press.
</p>
<p>" We remain your obedient servants,
</p>
<p>"SMITH BROTHERS & CO."
</p>
<p>Despite the offer of proof to the contrary, the Chief
</p>
<p>maintained his charge as to the tin, and wrote Hon.
</p>
<p>John P. Hale, chairman of the Senate Committee, to that
</p>
<p>effect on the 21st of May, 1864.
</p>
<p>On the same date, he attempted to ^^make the wool
</p>
<p>fly " by testimony as follows :
</p>
<p>Question. In your answer to the twelfth interrogatory
</p>
<p>you state that there was $100,000 worth of tin called
</p>
<p>Straits tin furnished for Banca tin ajid charged as Banca
</p>
<p>tin. Do you know of your knowledge whether Smith
</p>
<p>Brothers & Company ever delivered any tin for Banca
</p>
<p>tin that was not ?
</p>
<p>Answer. I have every reason to believe that they
</p>
<p>never delivered one single pound of Banca tin, although
</p>
<p>in one bill they charged Banca tin and delivered Straits
</p>
<p>tin.

</p>
<p>Subsequently the witness was asked :
</p>
<p>80
</p>
<p>Question. Were these interrogatories submitted to
</p>
<p>you some time ago by the Navy Department ?
</p>
<p>Answer. They were not submitted to me by the Navy
</p>
<p>Department.
</p>
<p>Question. You have seen them ?
</p>
<p>Answer. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Question. Where did you see them ?
</p>
<p>Answer. I prepared them myself, because I was told
</p>
<p>by the Navy Department that I should be sworn.
</p>
<p>Question. Did you prepare your answers to them in
</p>
<p>writing before you came here ?
</p>
<p>Answer. Yes, after having full knowledge of the
</p>
<p>facts, and after going over the whole business.
</p>
<p>The falsity of this testimony was finally established by the
</p>
<p>testimony of the naval officer, Inspector of Ordnance at the
</p>
<p>Navy Yard, and the personal friend of the Chief as admit-
</p>
<p>ted in evidence, by testimony as follows, from the record :
</p>
<p>" In my examination to-day I have found a requisi-
</p>
<p>" tion that was supplied by Smith Brothers, of Banca
</p>
<p>*' tin, May 16, 1863. Banca tin was furnished by Smith
</p>
<p>*' Brothers on that occasion. I know it to be Banca tin.
</p>
<p>*' There were 504| pounds at 56 cents, Banca tin."
</p>
<p>This swift witness was the author of the "dead-cock-
</p>
<p>in-the-pit " letter ; of whom Senator Sumner wrote :
</p>
<p>" The writer of this letter, after appearing before the
</p>

</p>
<p>Answer. He did, sir.
</p>
<p>Interrogatory 28. And did you not sign it ?
</p>
<p>Answer. Yes, sir ; / told him there were a great many
</p>
<p>things in that paper that were not right, and he said it
</p>
<p>was not anything very particular. I wanted to get it
</p>
<p>right. He wanted me to go down stairs and sign it, and
</p>
<p>I told a man down there I did not want to sign it.

</p>
<p>Answer. I did not think it was right  anywhere near.
</p>
<p>He did not ask me any questions. I did not think that
</p>
<p>was right at the time.
</p>
<p>Interrogatory 38. Wherein Avas it not right ?
</p>
<p>Answer. Because he sat down and read it over, and
</p>
<p>wrote what he had a mind to, and I told him about a
</p>
<p>great many things, and he said it did not amount to
</p>
<p>anything. There were things there stated that there
</p>
<p>was nothing of truth in.

</p>
<p>82
</p>
<p>off all his stuff, and if I said anything about it, he said
</p>
<p>that would not make any difference, and he read off what
</p>
<p>he wanted. He called another man to write, and I told
</p>
<p>him it was not right.
</p>
<p>Cross-Interrogatory 15. Then this was it : one man
</p>
<p>dictated to another man what to write ; told him what to
</p>
<p>write; the other man wrote down what the other directed
</p>
<p>to write ; and thereupon you were required to sign it.
</p>
<p>Is that so ?
</p>
<p>Answer. That was so.
</p>
<p>Interrogatory. Did you receive a message from this
</p>
<p>man, that if you did not produce your books they would
</p>
<p>come and take them by force ?

</p>
<p>his own lips. When I was up there he said it.

<p>FALSIFICATIONS AND PERVERSIONS OF TESTI-

<p>MONY, BY JUDGES-ADVOCATE.
</p>
<p>In a Review of the Argument op the Judge Advo-
</p>
<p>cate, BY F. W. Smith.
</p>
<p>The Prefatory Note was as follows :
</p>
<p>The errors and perversions of testimony in the argu-
</p>
<p>ment of the Judge- Advocate, were so many and so gross,
</p>
<p>that it was thought expedient to notice a few of them.
</p>
<p>They might mislead those who had no opportunity to
</p>
<p>consult the record of the evidence.
</p>
<p>The engagements of my counsel being such that they
</p>
<p>could not give to the matter early attention, I have, with
</p>
<p>their concurrence, attempted the task myself.
</p>
<p>T T ^ ^ ^
</p>
<p>I submit the result of this farther effort to inform the
</p>
<p>public of the facts in the case, to the candid judgment
</p>
<p>of those who may be interested to examine it.

</p>
<p>Sixty-eight citations from the argument of the Judge-
</p>
<p>Advocate were compared with the stenographic record
</p>
<p>of the court, to iUustrate the reckless falsification and
</p>
<p>perversion of the testimony. This Review was mailed
</p>
<p>to all members of Congress and to the revising counsel
</p>
<p>of the Navy Department ; after its receipt, he abandoned
</p>
<p>all charges save the one hundred dollars on tin.
</p>
<p>The introduction to the document (144 pages octavo),
</p>
<p>is as follows :
</p>
<p>On the 11th day of January, 1865, the one hundred
</p>
<p>thirteenth dap from the commencement of the hearing.
</p>
<p>Judge Advocate Smith concluded his reply to the argu-
</p>
<p>ment of counsel for the defence. The most sacred inter-
</p>
<p>ests of the respondent'were now to be adjudicated, not
</p>
<p>by the unanimous decision of twelve of his fellow-citi-
</p>
<p>zens, but by the vote of four among seven naval officers,
</p>
<p>from distant sections of the country, appointed by the
</p>
<p>accusing party, and sworn to secrecy as to their respect-
</p>
<p>ive judgments ; the Judges- Advocate remaining with the
</p>
<p>court.
</p>
<p>This is a feature of courts-martial peculiarly abhor-
</p>
<p>rent to our sense of justice, that when they have had the
</p>
<p>last W(yrd in argument, however unjust in spirit or untrue in
</p>
<p>statement, the Judges-Advocate are present at the private
</p>
<p>deliberations of those acting as judge and jury, deciding
</p>
<p>upon both law and fact.

<p>From among more than five thousand business and pri-
</p>
<p>vate letters and copies of letters, forcibly seized from
</p>
<p>Smith Brothers & Co., and subject to the scrutiny of
</p>
<p>detectives for months, there were but two which could
</p>
<p>be perverted to their apparent injury, except that, upon

</p>
<p>It is, therefore, necessary to refute these insinuations ;
</p>
<p>and to show that said letters, like every writing or act
</p>
<p>of Smith Brothers & Co. upon the record of the hearing,
</p>
<p>so far from tarnishing, do vindicate their reputation for
</p>
<p>integrity.
</p>
<p>The final recapitulation of arguments in defence from
</p>
<p>the Review was prefaced as follows :
</p>
<p>The defendant asks for an impartial judgment upon
</p>
<p>the record of his defence ; the record being viewed in
</p>
<p>the light of all surrounding circumstances.
</p>
<p>A BUSINESS OF $1,250,000, covering an almost infinite
</p>
<p>variety of detail, prosecuted at a period of unprecedented
</p>
<p>excitement in the business world; of scarcity of mer-
</p>
<p>chandise, of financial panic and uncertainty ; a business
</p>
<p>involving inevitably the " work of other men's hands,"
</p>
<p>and reliance upon other men's faithfulness  this business
</p>
<p>hunted, pried into, from March until September, by a
</p>
<p>secret detective inquisition that called before it more than
</p>
<p>one hundred different parties to be probed and cate-
</p>
<p>chized; an inquisition that in June, under military
</p>
<p>authority, seized all the business and private books,
</p>
<p>papers and correspondence of the firm from warehouse
</p>
<p>and dwellings, that had then all original letters, invoices,
</p>
<p>and entries under its hand, by which it could trace every
</p>
<p>transaction from its inception to its conclusion, its profit,
</p>
<p>its payment ; that called to its aid accountant experts to
</p>
<p>fathom the ledgers and cash books ; this business, thus
</p>
<p>BISSECTED AND ANALYZED WITH HOSTILE INTENT AS NEVER
</p>
<p>BEFORE WAS A LIKE BUSINESS SCRUTINIZED IN NeW ENG-
</p>
<p>LAND, REVEALED FIVE SUCH CHARGES OF FRAUD, AS HAVE
</p>

<p>amount of the business. Such were the developments
</p>
<p>86
</p>
<p>of an inquisition upon, as the Judge-Advocate asserts,
</p>
<p>"an extensive system of frauds." Such, the charges,
</p>
<p>upon which, in addition to the severities and indignities
</p>
<p>above mentioned, the respondent was prosecuted, bail
</p>
<p>demanded of five hundred thousand dollars, and he was
</p>
<p>subjected to a military trial of four months' duration,
</p>
<p>nearly ruinous to his health, destructive to his business,
</p>
<p>and costing him in legal and other expenses attending
</p>
<p>the trial, more than $20,000, and in losses resulting to
</p>
<p>his business of an equal amount.
</p>
<p>The terse, incisive verdict of President Lincoln upon
</p>
<p>this history, it has been seen, was based upon the self-
</p>
<p>evident absurdity of the allegations.

</p>
<p>The military seizure of the warehouse of Smith Bro-
</p>
<p>thers & Co. was at the precise period of advertisement
</p>
<p>for annual supplies. Although the inquisition had been
</p>
<p>in session three months in Boston, no charges were pre-
</p>
<p>ferred until a month after the pillage of their premises
</p>
<p>and the paralysis of their business, at a great loss.
</p>
<p>Many papers have never been recovered.
</p>
<p>Thus, when it had been found that official opposition
</p>
<p>and annoyance would not drive them from the field, the
</p>
<p>war power was invoked, their business wrested from
</p>
<p>them, and all their resources of mental endurance and
</p>
<p>pecuniary strength demanded in defense from utter
</p>
<p>ruin. Then, upon the award of new contracts, men

<p>who had solicited them to participate in bribery, and
</p>
<p>87
</p>
<p>had been repelled, succeeded to government patronage^
</p>
<p>So great was the shock to the business community by
</p>
<p>the violence toward Smith Brothers (as had been pre-
</p>
<p>dicted by the delegation from Massachusetts, in their
</p>
<p>paper to the President,) that respectable mercantile
</p>
<p>houses dared not enter the competition.
</p>
<p>Therefore while Franklin W. Smith was being
</p>
<p>hounded on a pretense of one hundred dollars differ-
</p>
<p>ence in value between Baiica and Revely tin (where no
</p>
<p>difference was proven to exist), the government entered
</p>
<p>into contract to such astounding damage as the follow-
</p>
<p>ing contracts reveal :
</p>
<p>These were the " spoils " to private parties from the
</p>
<p>government treasury, following the "raid" of the Navy
</p>
<p>Department on Smith Brothers for an alleged wrong of

<p>$100 ; a raid that cost the government not less than

<p>Exhibit of the Profits of Smith Brothers & Co. on
</p>
<p>grovernment business.
</p>
<p>During the cross-examination of Mr. B. Q. Smith, the
</p>
<p>Judge Advocate produced from the papers of Smith
</p>
<p>Brothers & Co. an elaborate exhibit of the profit and
</p>
<p>loss upon air their government business, from its com-
</p>
<p>mencement in 1861 to February 1, 1862.
</p>
<p>Mr. Smith testified that it was a private paper, pre-
</p>
<p>pared by his brother for his own satisfaction, and that
</p>
<p>it was among those forcibly abstracted from his brother's
</p>
<p>dwelling-house. It was the only statement of the kind
</p>
<p>which had been made, and was most opportune evi-
</p>
<p>dence in support of his account of the profits from the
</p>
<p>business of the firm.
</p>
<p>Mr. B. Gr. Smith further stated that he had never be-
</p>
<p>fore seen the paper, except at the time it was prepared,
</p>
<p>and that he then observed only the results, not spend-
</p>
<p>ing over ten minutes in its examination.

</p>
<p>SUPPRESSION OF THE DECISION OF PRESIDENT
</p>
<p>LINCOLN, BY SECRETARY WELLES, FOR FOUR
</p>
<p>YEARS, DURING THE JOHNSON ADMINISTRA-
</p>
<p>TION  REVISION OF THE VERDICT OF THE
</p>
<p>COURT BY COUNSEL OF THE NAVY DEPART-
</p>
<p>MENT.
</p>
<p>Upon the annulment of the case by President Lincoln,
</p>
<p>there was great public interest to know the precise terms
</p>
<p>of his decision. His assassination followed immediately ;
</p>
<p>and it was supposed that the promulgation of his disap-
</p>
<p>proval was simply overlooked in the direful excitement
</p>
<p>of that tragedy. Meanwhile it was reported that the
</p>
<p>endorsement of the President was remarkably quaint
</p>
<p>and characteristic ; and a humorous version of it was
</p>
<p>published throughout the country. (V. Ex. N. Y.
</p>
<p>Tribune. )
</p>
<p>At length Senator Sumner, in behalf of Mr. Smith,
</p>
<p>called upon the Secretary of the Navy for an official copy
</p>
<p>of the record. To his astonishment and indignation it
</p>
<p>was refused by the Secretary, on the ground that it was
</p>
<p>his duty to shield the court from further reprehension.
</p>
<p>A lengthy correspondence ensued, Mr. Sumner claiming
</p>
<p>that the record was not only of right the property of Mr.
</p>
<p>Smith, but also of the public. Tired of conflict, the res-
</p>
<p>pondent in the case decided to await Secretary Welles'
</p>
<p>retirement from office.
</p>
<p>Not until 1869 did he have access to the record of the
</p>
<p>court, in the arcl^ves of the Navy Department. It may
</p>
<p>be seen on their shelves, in ten massive volumes /olio ; by
</p>
<p>far the most voluminous and, consequently, most expen-
</p>
<p>sive record of a court-martial since the foundation of the
</p>
<p>government.
</p>
<p>Extraordinary details are revealed in that record, that

</p>
<p>will have yet a more full compilation. This summary
</p>
<p>relates more to a personal vindication than to the great
</p>
<p>91
</p>
<p>public importance of the case ; which was impressively''
</p>
<p>set forth by Judge Parker in his last lecture as Professor
</p>
<p>of the Harvard Law School.
</p>
<p>Following the record of the court is the Opinion of the
</p>
<p>Reviser of the Department. It labors to sustain the war-
</p>
<p>rant for the case, but as President Lincoln said of it to
</p>
<p>Senator Sumner, he is compelled to abandon all allega-
</p>
<p>tions for this intensely fought prosecution, except the
</p>
<p>''^ sure thing on ^Ae ^m," involving less than |100. He
</p>
<p>decided as follows :
</p>
<p>First. The finding of the court on tin was " justified."^
</p>
<p>Second. The finding of the court on emery cloth, less
</p>
<p>clearly made out, and less important.
</p>
<p>Third. " The same observation is, in my judgment,
</p>
<p>" applicable to the third specification under both
</p>
<p>" charges. The delivery of inferior articles is very small
</p>
<p>" in comparison with the whole quantity delivered under
</p>
<p>" the contract, and may well have happened through
</p>
<p>" inadvertence."
</p>
<p>Secretary Welles had good need to protect his court
</p>
<p>not only from farther " public reprehension," but ridi-
</p>
<p>cule, in view of the record to which the seven old naval
</p>
<p>officers attached their verdict of
</p>
<p>a i Pfoven^' as to 24 single articles of hardware in a
</p>
<p>contract for 12,564 single articles ; and ' not proven ' as
</p>
<p>to the others."
</p>
<p>At this point the verdict of the Boston Board of Trade
</p>
<p>is apposite : 
</p>
<p>"In view of such facts, the charge of 'fraud' or of
</p>
<p>" fraudulent intention is utterly frivolous. The wonder
</p>
<p>" indeed is, that in so large a business, and in the con-
</p>
<p>*' dition of the market since the beginning of the war,
</p>

</p>
<p>These were the conclusions by the counsel of the con-
</p>
<p>spirators, from 2,500 pages of testimony, gathered after
</p>
<p>a year of inquisition and court-martial ; at a cost to the
</p>
<p>government of at least $40,000 ; to the respondents, in
</p>
<p>legal expenses, printing, etc., of $20,000 ; and of dam-
</p>
<p>ages in aggregate that $100,000 would not compensate.
</p>
<p>This will be accepted as within the fact, when it is
</p>
<p>realized that the defendant's business, established in
</p>
<p>Boston and New York, after twenty years of enterprise,
</p>
<p>was utterly destroyed by the onslaught ; all books and
</p>
<p>papers being held for the period of nine months from
</p>
<p>their seizure, and the utmost powers of mental and
</p>
<p>physical endurance being demanded in defence of all
</p>
<p>that could make life desirable. Not only were all busi-
</p>
<p>ness facilities collapsed by the blow, but the defendant
</p>
<p>could only recover mental poise and strength to re-enter
</p>
<p>upon the activities of life by absolute retirement to the
</p>
<p>quiet of rural pursuits.
</p>
<p>The sense of outrage at the above revision of the
</p>
<p>counsel of the Navy Department, sent by President
</p>
<p>Lincoln to Senator Sumner for his review, prompted his
</p>
<p>emphatic indignation :
</p>
<p>" If a mountain in labor ever brought forth a mouse,
</p>
<p>" it is this mountainous prosecution, whose only off-
</p>
<p>" spring yet crawling on earth is an allegation of loss to
</p>
<p>*' the United States of one hundred dollars ! But if we
</p>
<p>" look farther at this transaction, it will be seen that it

</p>
<p>THE CAIN TO GOVERNMENT UPON CONTRACTS
</p>
<p>WITH SMITH BROTHERS.
</p>
<p>EXTRACT FROM REPORT OP THE BOSTON BOARD OP TRADE.
</p>
<p>" Bandaged eyes and even scales are the emblems of
</p>
<p>justice. Before a civil tribunal  State or Federal 
</p>
<p>our Associate would have been tried on a suit of contfaGty
</p>
<p>by a judge of high legal attainments who would have
</p>
<p>confined the evidence to the case; and who would have deci-
</p>
<p>ded to admit or reject testimony after arguments of counsel,
</p>
<p>and in the presence of both parties to the issue. And, non-
</p>
<p>performance proved, the jury would have returned a
</p>
<p>verdict of damages in dollars and cents ; and  no ap-
</p>
<p>peal  here the matter would have terminated. Justice
</p>
<p>is even-handed between individuals, and should be so
</p>
<p>between Governments and citizens. For the first time,
</p>
<p>and upon this point, we quote from Mr. Smith's ' Review
</p>
<p>of the Argument of the Judge Advocate,' thus :  "
</p>
<p>" The loss of interest to Smith Brothers & Co. has not
</p>
<p>been less than two per cent upon their sales, through the
</p>
<p>delinquency of Government payment ; or $25,000 on
</p>
<p>$1,250,000; although the early contracts stipulated that
</p>
<p>payments ' will be paid by the Navy Agent within thirty
</p>
<p>days after bills, duly authenticated, shall have been pre-
</p>
<p>sented to him.' "
</p>
<p>Again : 
</p>
<p>*' It required energy and caution to prevent these
</p>
<p>contracts from being disastrous. Many were abandoned
</p>
<p>by other parties on account of losses involved ; and re-
</p>
<p>lief bills were passed by Congress for contractors : but

<p>Smith Brothers & Co. fulfilled their contracts with Gov-
</p>
<p>94
</p>
<p>ernment (as with all men), coniraets on which the advance
</p>
<p>realized to Government was certainly not less than $200,000."
</p>
<p>''The 'advance' was for the benefit of the country;
</p>
<p>but, on the other hand, the country should, as ' between
</p>
<p>man and man,' make good the ' loss,' whether much
</p>
<p>or little ; because the country is not entitled  in popu-
</p>
<p>lar phrase  to ' both sides of the bargain.' The result,
</p>
<p>then, on this branch of our inquiry is, that, on a question
</p>
<p>of contract, Franklin W. Smith, and not the Grovernment^
</p>
<p>is the party entitled to a verdict for damages."
</p>
<p>Smith Brothers contracted for 3000 tons of pig-iron,
</p>
<p>for shot and shell, at an average of about 25 dollars per
</p>
<p>ton. Before the delivery was completed the value ad-
</p>
<p>vanced to 42 dollars per ton ; making a gain to the
</p>
<p>Government of more than 40,000 dollars ; but fully this
</p>
<p>sum was revengefully wasted upon their persecution.
</p>
<p>Merchants will realize the excessive labor, perplexity
</p>
<p>and responsibility involved in outfit of ships of war,
</p>
<p>upon peremptory orders for a multiplicity of articles, at
</p>
<p>brief notice of a fixed hour of sailing, in a time of great
</p>
<p>dearth of merchandise.

<p>" Upon the reception of the sad news of the death of

<p>our beloved President, a meeting was called in Tremont

<p>and the American flag, also draped, was thrown over

<p>the pulpit. A fine portrait of President Lincoln was

<p>also placed in front of the pulpit. Franklin W. Smith,

<p>By three o'clock the people began to assemble on the
