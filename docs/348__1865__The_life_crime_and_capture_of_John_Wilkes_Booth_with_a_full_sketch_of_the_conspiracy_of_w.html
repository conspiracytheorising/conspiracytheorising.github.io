</p>
<p>EXPLANATORY.
</p>
<p>One year ago the writer of the letters which follow, visiled the
</p>
<p>Battle Field of Waterloo. In looking over many relics of the combat
</p>
<p>preserved in the Museum there, he was particularly interested in the files
</p>
<p>of journals contemporary with the action. These contained the Duke of
</p>
<p>Wellington's first despatch announcing the victory, the reports of the sub-
</p>
<p>ordinate commanders, and the current gossip as to the episodes and
</p>
<p>hazards of the day.
</p>
<p>The time will come when remarkable incidents of these our times
</p>
<p>will be a staple of as great curiosity as the issue of Waterloo. It is an
</p>
<p>incident without a precedent on this side of the globe, and never to be
</p>
<p>repeated.
</p>
<p>Assassination has made its last effort to become indigenous here.
</p>
<p>The public sentiment of Loyalist and Rebel has denounced it : the world
</p>
<p>has remarked it with uplifted hands and words of execration. Therefore,
</p>
<p>as long as history shall hold good, the murder of the President will be a
</p>
<p>theme for poesy, romance and tragedy. We who live in this consecrated
</p>
<p>time keep the sacred souvenirs of Mr. Lincoln's death in our possession ;
</p>
<p>and the best of these are the news letters descriptive of his apotheosis,
</p>
<p>and the fate of the conspirators who slew him.
</p>
<p>I represented the World newspaper at Washington during the whole
</p>
<p>of those exciting weeks, and wrote their occurrences fresh from the
</p>
<p>mouths of the actors.

<p>iv Prefatory.
</p>
<p>It has seemed fitting to Messrs. Dick <fe Fitzgerald to repn
</p>
<p>the World letters, as a keepsake for the many who received them kindly 
</p>
<p>The Sketches appended were conscientiously written, and whatever em-
</p>
<p>bellishments they may seem to have grew out of the stirring events,  not
</p>
<p>out of my fancy.
</p>
<p>Subsequent investigation has confirmed the veracity even of their
</p>
<p>speculations. I have arranged them, but have not altered them ; if they
</p>
<p>represent nothing else, they do carry with them the fever and spirit of
</p>
<p>the time. But they do not assume to be literal history : We live too
</p>
<p>close to the events related to decide positively upon them. As a brochure
</p>
<p>of the day,  nothing more,  I give these Sketches of a Correspondent
</p>
<p>to the public.

</p>
<p>THE LIFE, CRIME, AND CAPTURE
</p>
<p>OF
</p>
<p>JOHN WILKES BOOTH.
</p>
<p>LETTER I.
</p>
<p>THE XIJE.DEB.
</p>
<p>Washington, April 17.
</p>
<p>Some very deliberate and extraordinary movements were made by a
</p>
<p>handsome and extremely well-dressed young man in the city of Washing-
</p>
<p>ton last Friday. At about half-past eleven o'clock a. m., this person, whose
</p>
<p>name is J. Wilkes Booth, by profession an actor, and recently engaged in
</p>
<p>oil speculations, sauntered into Ford's Theater, on Tenth, between E and
</p>
<p>F streets, and exchanged greetings with the man at the box-office. In the
</p>
<p>conversation which ensued, the ticket agent informed Booth that a box was
</p>
<p>taken for Mr. Lincoln and General Grant, who were expected to visit the
</p>
<p>theater, and contribute to the benefit of Miss Laura Keene, and satisfy the
</p>
<p>curiosity of a large audience. Mr. Booth went away with a jest, and a
</p>
<p>lightly-spoken " Good afternoon." Strolling down to Pumphreys' stable,
</p>
<p>on C street, in the rear of the National Hotel, he engaged a saddle horse,
</p>
<p>a high-strung, ftist, beautiful bay mare, telling Mr. Pumphreys that he
</p>
<p>should call for her in the middle of the afternoon.
</p>
<p>From here he went to the Kirk wood Hotel, on the corner of Pennsylva-
</p>
<p>nia avenue and Twelfth street, where, calling for a card and a sheet of note-
</p>
<p>paper, he sat down and wrote upon the first as follows :
</p>
<p>For Mr. Andrew Johnson : 
</p>
<p>1 dou't wish to disturb you ; aro you at home ?
</p>
<p>J. W. Booth.
</p>
<p>To this message, which was sent up by the obliging clerk, Mr. Johnson
</p>
<p>responded that he was very busily engaged. Mr. Booth smiled, and turn-
</p>
<p>ino- to his sheet of note-paper, wrote on it. The fact, if fact it is, that he had
</p>
<p>been disappointed in not obtaining an examination of the Vice-President's
</p>
<p>apartment and a knowledge of the Vice-President's probable whereabouts
</p>
<p>the ensuing evening, in no way affected his composure. The note, the con-
</p>
<p>tents of which are unknown, was signed and sealed within a few momenta.
</p>
<p>Booth arose, bowed to an acquaintance, and passed into the street. His
</p>
<p>elegant person was seen on the avenue a few minutes, and was withdrawn

</p>
<p>into the Metropolitan Hotel.
</p>
<p>At 4 p. M., he again appeared at Pumphreys' livery stable, mounted the
</p>
<p>mare he had engaged, rode leisurely up F street, turned into au alley be-
</p>
<p> The Life, Crime, and Capture of John Wi^es Booth.
</p>
<p>tween Ninth and Tenth streets, and thence into an alley releading to the
</p>
<p>rear of Ford's Theater, which fronts on Tenth street, between E and F
</p>
<p>streets. Here he alighted and deposited the mare in a smaLl stable oft' the
</p>
<p>alley, which he had hired some time before for the accommodation of a
</p>
<p>saddle-horse which he had recently sold. Mr. Booth soon afterward retired
</p>
<p>from the stable, and is supposed to have refreshed himself at a neighboring
</p>
<p>bar-room.
</p>
<p>At 8 o'clock the same evening. President Lincoln and Speaker Colfax
</p>
<p>sat together in a private room at the White House, pleasantly conversing.
</p>
<p>General Grant, with whom the President had engaared to attend Ford's
</p>
<p>Theater that evening, had left with his wife for Burlington, New-Jersey, in
</p>
<p>the 6 o'clock train. After this departure Mr. Lincoln rather reluctantly
</p>
<p>determined to keep his part of the engagement, rather than to disappoint
</p>
<p>his friends and the audience. Mrs. Lincoln, entering the room and turn-
</p>
<p>ing to Mr. Colfax, said, in a half laughing", half serious way, " Well, Mr.
</p>
<p>Lincoln, are you going to the theater with me or noti" "I suppose I
</p>
<p>shall have to go, Colfax," said the President, and the Speaker took his leave
</p>
<p>in company with Major Rathbone, of the Provost-Marshal General's office,
</p>
<p>who escorted Miss Harris, daughter of Senator Harris, of New-York. Mr.
</p>
<p>and Mrs. Lincoln reached Ford's Theater at twenty minutes before 9
</p>
<p>o'clock.
</p>
<p>The house was filled in every part with a large and brilliantly attired
</p>
<p>audience. As the presidential party ascended the stairs, and passed behind
</p>
<p>the dress circle to the entrance of the private box reserved for them, the
</p>
<p>whole assemblage, having in mind the recent Union victories, arose, cheer-
</p>
<p>ed, waving hats and handkerchiefs, and manifesting every other accustomed
</p>
<p>sign of enthusiasm. The President, last to enter the box, turned before
</p>

</p>
<p>doing so, and bowed a courteous acknowledgment of his reception. At
</p>
<p>the moment of the President's arrival, Mr. Hawks, one of the actors, per-
</p>
<p>forming the well-known part of Dundreary, had exclaimed : " This re-
</p>
<p>minds me of a story, as Mr. Lincoln says." The audience forced him,
</p>
<p>after the interruption, to tell the story over again. It evidently pleased
</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln, who turned laughingly to his wife and made a remark which
</p>
<p>was not overheard.
</p>
<p>The box in which the President sat consisted of two boxes turned into
</p>
<p>one, the middle partition being removed, as on all occasions when a state
</p>
<p>party visited the theater. The box was on a level with the dress circle;
</p>
<p>about twelve feet above the stage. There were two entrances  the door
</p>
<p>nearest to the wall having been closed and locked ; the door nearest the
</p>
<p>balustrades of the dress circle, and at right angles with it, being open and
</p>
<p>left open after the visitors had entered. The interior was carpeted, lined
</p>
<p>with crimson paper, and furnished with a sofa covered with crimson velvet,
</p>
<p>three arm chairs similarly covered, and six cane-bottomed chairs. Fes-
</p>
<p>toons of flags hung before the front of the box against a background of lace.
</p>
<p>President Lincoln took one of the arm-chairs and seated himself in the
</p>
<p>front of the box, in the angle nearest the audience, where, partially screen-
</p>
<p>ed from observation, he had the best view of what was transpiring on the
</p>
<p>stage. Mrs. Lincoln sat next to him, and Miss Harris in the opposite angle
</p>
<p>nearest the stage. Major Rathbone sat just behind Mrs. Lincoln and Miss
</p>
<p>Harris. These four were the only persons in the box.
</p>
<p>The play proceeded, although " Our American Cousin," without Mr.
</p>
<p>Sothern, has, since that gentleman's departure from this country, been just-
</p>
<p>ly esteemed a very dull affiiir. The audience at Ford's, including Mrs.
</p>
<p>Lincoln, seemed to enjoy it very much. The worthv wife of the President
</p>
<p>leaned forward, her hand upon her husband's knee, watching every scene
</p>
<p>in the drama with amused attention. Even across the President's face at
</p>
<p>intervals swept a smile, robbing it of its habitual sadness.
</p>
<p>About the beginning of the second act, the mare, standing in the stable
</p>
<p>in the rear of the theater, was disturbed in the midst of her meal by the
</p>
<p>entrance of the young man who had quitted her in the afternoon. It is
</p>
<p>presumed that she was saddled and bridled with exquisite care.

</p>
<p>Having completed these preparations, Mr. Booth entered the theater by
</p>
<p>the stage door; summoned one of the scene shifters, Mr. John Spangler,
</p>
<p>emerged through the same door with that individual, leaving the door open,
</p>
<p>and left the mare in his hands to be held until he (Booth) should return.
</p>
<p>Booth who was even more fashionably and richly dressed than usual, walk-
</p>
<p>ed thence around to the front of the theater, and went in. Ascending to
</p>
<p>the dress circle, he stood for a little time gazing around upon the audience
</p>
<p>and occasionally upon the stage in his usual graceful manner. He was
</p>
<p>subsequently observed by Mr. Ford, the proprietor of the theater, to be
</p>
<p>slowly elbowing his way through the crowd that packed the rear of the
</p>
<p>dress circle toward the right side, at the extremity of which was the box
</p>
<p>where Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln and their companions were seated. Mr. Ford
</p>
<p>casually noticed this as a slightly extraordinary symptom of interest on
</p>
<p>the part of an actor so familiar with the routine of the theater and the play.
</p>
<p>The curtain had arisen on the third act, Mrs. Mountchessingtoii and Asa
</p>
<p>Trenchard were exchanging vivacious stupidities, when a young man, so
</p>
<p>precisely resembling the one described as J. Wilkes Booth that he is as-
</p>
<p>serted to be the same, appeared before the open door of the President's
</p>
<p>box, and prepared to enter.
</p>
<p>The servant who attended Mr. Lincoln said politely, "this is the Presi-
</p>
<p>.W
</p>
<p>6
</p>
<p>The Life, Crime and Capture of John Wilkes Booth.
</p>
<p>dent's "box, sir, no one is permitted to enter." " I am a senator," respond,
</p>
<p>ed the person, " Mr. Lincoln has ^nt for me." The attendant gave way,
</p>
<p>and the young man passed into the box.
</p>
<p>As he appeared at the door, taking a quick, comprehensive glance at th6
</p>
<p>interior, Major Rathbone arose. " Are you aware, sir," he said, courteous-
</p>
<p>ly, " upon whom you are intruding? This is the President's box, and no
</p>
<p>one is admitted." The intruder answered not a word. Fastening his eyes
</p>
<p>upon Mr, Lincoln, who had h^f turned his head to ascertain what caused
</p>
<p>the disturbance, he stepped quickly back without the door.
</p>
<p>Without this door there was an eyehole, bored it is presumed on the
</p>
<p>afternoon of the crime, while the theater was deserted by all save a few
</p>
<p>mechanics. Glancing through this orifice, John Wilkes Booth espied in a
</p>
<p>moment the precise position of the President ; he wore upon his wrinkling
</p>
<p>face the pleasant embryo of an honest smile, forgetting in the mimic scene
</p>
<p>the splendid successes of our arms for which he was responsible, and the
</p>
<p>history he had filled so well.
</p>
<p>The cheerful interior was lost to J. Wilkes Booth. He did' not catch
</p>
<p>the spirit of the delighted" audience, of the flaming lamps flinging illumina-
</p>
<p>tion upon the domestic foreground and the gaily set stage. He only cast
</p>
<p>one furtive glance upon the man he was to slay, and thrusting one hand
</p>
<p>in his bosom, another in his skirt pocket, drew forth simultaneously his
</p>
<p>deadly weapons. His right palm grasped a Derringer pistol, his left a dirk.
</p>
<p>Thenj at a stride, he passed the threshold again, levelled his arm at the
</p>
<p>President and bent the trigger.
</p>
<p>A keen quick report and a puflT of white smoke,  a close smell of
</p>
<p>powder and the rush of a dark, imperfectly outlined figure, and the
</p>
<p>President's head dropped upon his shoulders : the ball was in his brain.
</p>
<p>The movements of the assassin were from henceforth quick aa the light

<p>The Theatre and its Surroundings.

<p>full upon the audience, with the knife lifted in his right hand above his

<p>head, he shouted "Sic semper tyrannis  Virginia is avenged !" Another

</p>
<p>person a word of information, rode out through the alley leading into F
</p>
<p>street, and thenos i ipidly away. Ilis horse's hoofs might almost have
</p>
<p>been heard amid the silence that for a few seconds dwelt in the interior of
</p>
<p>the theater.
</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Lincoln screamed, Miss Harris cried for water, and the full
</p>
<p>ghastly truth broke upon all  "The President is murdered ! " The scene
</p>
<p>that ensued was as tumultuous and terrible as one of Dante's pictures of
</p>
<p>hell. Some women fainted, others uttered piercing shrieks, and cries for
</p>
<p>vengeance and unmeaning shouts for help burst from the mouths of men.
</p>
<p>Miss Laura Keene, the actress, proved herself in this awful time as equal
</p>
<p>to sustain a part in real tragedy as to interpret that of the stage. Pausing
</p>
<p>one moment before the footlights to entreat the audience to be calm, she
</p>
<p>ascended the stairs in the rear of Mr. Lincoln's box, entered it, took the
</p>
<p>dying President's head in her lap, bathed it with the water she had brought,
</p>
<p>and endeavoured to force some of the liquid through the insensible lips.
</p>
<p>The locality of the wound was at first supposed to be in the breast. It
</p>
<p>was not until after the neck and shoulders had been bared and no mark
</p>
<p>discovered, that the dress of Miss Keene, stained with blood, revealed where
</p>
<p>the ball had penetrated.
</p>
<p>This moment gave the most impressive episode in the history of the
</p>
<p>Continent.
</p>
<p>The Chief Magistrate of thirty millions of people  beloved, honored,
</p>
<p>revered,  lay in the pent up closet of a pjay-house, dabbling with his sa-
</p>
<p>cred blood the robes of an actress.
</p>
<p>As soon as the confusion and crowd was partially overcome, the form
</p>
<p>of the President was conveyed from the theater to the residence of Mr.
</p>
<p>Peterson, on the opposite side of Tenth street. Here upon a bed, in a
</p>
<p>little hastily prepared chamber, it was laid and attended by Surgeoa-
</p>
<p>General Barnes and other physicians, speedily summoned.
</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the news spread through the capital, as if borne on
</p>
<p>tonfjues of flame. Senator Sumner, hearing at his residence, of the affair
</p>
<p>took a carriage and drove at a gallop to the White House, when he heard
</p>
<p>where it had taken place, to find Robert Lincoln and other members of
</p>
<p>the household still unaware of it. Both drove to Ford's Theater, and

</p>
<p>were soon at the President's bedside. Secretary Stanton and the other
</p>
<p>members of the cabinet were at hand almost as soon. A vast crowd, surg-
</p>
<p>ing up Pennsylvania avenue toward Willard's Hotel, cried, ".The Presi-
</p>
<p>dent is shot !" " President Lincoln is murdered." Another crowd sweep-
</p>
<p>ing down the avenue met the first with the tidings, " Secretary Seward has
</p>
<p>been assassinated in bed." Instantly a wild apprehension of an organized
</p>
<p>conspiracy and of other murders took possession of the people. The shout
</p>
<p>" to arms !" was mingled with the expressions of sorrow and rage that ev-
</p>
<p>erywhere filled the air. " Where is General Grant ?" or " where is Secre-
</p>
<p>tary Stantpn !" " Where are the rest of the cabinet ?" broke from thous-
</p>
<p>ands of lips. A conflagration of fire is not half so terrible as was the
</p>
<p>conflagration of passion that rolled through the streets and houses of
</p>
<p>Washington on that awful night.
</p>
<p>The attempt on the life of Secretary Seward was perhaps as daring, if
</p>
<p>not so dramatic, as the assassination of the President. At 9 :20 o'clock a
</p>
<p>man, tall, athletic, and dressed in light coloured clothes, alighted from a
</p>
<p>horse in front of Mr. Seward's residence in Madison place, where the secr&.
</p>
<p>tary was lying, very feeble from his recent injuries. The house, a solid
</p>
<p>three-story brick building, was formerly the old Washington Club-house.
</p>
<p>Leaving his horse standing, the stranger rang at the door, and informed the
</p>
<p>The Obsequies in Washington.
</p>
<p>11
</p>
<p>servant who admitted him that he desired to see Mr. Sevrard. The servant
</p>
<p>responded that Mr. Seward was very ill, and that no visitors were admitted.
</p>
<p>" But 1 am a messenger from T)y. Verdi, Mr. Seward's physician ; I have
</p>
<p>a prescription which 1 must deliver to him myself." The servant still de-
</p>
<p>murring, the stranger, without further parley, pushed him aside and as-
</p>
<p>cended the stairs. Moving to the right, he proceeded towards Mr. Sew-
</p>
<p>ard's room, and was about to enter it, when Mr. Frederick Seward
</p>
<p>appeared from an opposite doorway and demanded his business. He
</p>
<p>responded in the same manner as to the servant below, but being met with
</p>
<p>a refusal, suddenly closed the controversy^ by striking Mr. Seward a severe
</p>
<p>and perhaps mortal blow across the forehead with the butt of a pistol. As
</p>
<p>the first victim fell, Major Seward, another and younger son of the secretary,
</p>
<p>emerged from his father's room. Without a word the man drew a knife
</p>
<p>and struck the major several blows with it, rushing into the chamber as he
</p>
<p>did so ; then, after dealing the nurse a horrible wound across the bowels,
</p>
<p>he sprang to the bed upon which the secretary lay, stabbing him once in
</p>
<p>the face and neck. Mr. Seward arose convulsively and fell from the bed to
</p>
<p>the floor. Turning and brandishing his knife anew, the assassin fled from
</p>
<p>the room, cleared the prostrate form of Frederick Seward in the hall, de-
</p>
<p>scended the stairs in three leaps, and was out of the door and upon his
</p>
<p>horse in an instant. It is stated by a person who saw him mount that,
</p>
<p>although he leaped upon his horse with most unseemly haste, he trotted
</p>
<p>away around the corner of the block with circumspect deliberation.
</p>
<p>Around both the house on Tenth street and the residence of Secretary
</p>
<p>Seward, as the fact of both tragedies became generally known, crowds soon
</p>
<p>gathered so vast and tumultuous that military guards scarcely sufficed to
</p>
<p>keep them from the doors.
</p>
<p>The room to which the President had been conveyed is on the first floor,
</p>
<p>at the end of the hall. It is only fifteen feet square, with a Brussels car-
</p>
<p>pet, papered with brown, and Jjung with a lithograph of Rosa Bonheur's
</p>
<p>" Horse Fair," an engraved copy of Herring's " Village Blacksmith," and
</p>
<p>two smaller ones of " The Stable" and " The Barn Yard," from the same
</p>
<p>artist. A table and bureau, spread with crotchet work, eight chairs and

</p>
<p>the bed, were all the furniture. Upon this bed, a low walnut four-poster,
</p>
<p>lay the dying President ; the blood oozing from the frightful wound in his
</p>
<p>head and staining the pillow. All that the medical skill of half a dozen
</p>
<p>accomplished surgeons could do had been done to prolong a life evidently
</p>
<p>ebbing from a mortal hurt.
</p>
<p>Secretary Stanton, just arrived from the bedside of Mr. Seward, asked
</p>
<p>Surgeon-General Barnes what was Mr. Lincoln's condition. " I fear, Mr.
</p>
<p>Stanton, that there is no hope." " O, no, general ; no, no ;" and the man,
</p>
<p>of all others, apparently strange to tears, sank down beside the bed, the
</p>
<p>hot, bitter evidences of an awful sorrow trickling through his fingers to the
</p>
<p>floor. Senator Sumner sat on the opposite side of the bed, holding one of
</p>
<p>the President's hands in his own, and sobbing with kindred grief. Secre-
</p>
<p>tary Welles stood at the foot of the bed, his face hidden, his frame shaken
</p>
<p>with emotion. General Halleck, Attorney-General Speed, Postmaster-
</p>
<p>General Dennison, M. B. Field, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, Judge
</p>
<p>Otto, General Meigs, and others, visited the chamber at times, and then
</p>
<p>retir-ed. Mrs. Lincoln  but there is no need to speak of her. Mrs. Sena-
</p>
<p>tor Dixon soon arrived, and remained with her through the night. All
</p>
<p>through the night, while the horror-stricken crowds outside swept and
</p>
<p>gathered along the streets, while the military and police were patrolling
</p>
<p>and weaving a cordon around the city ; while men were arming and ask

<p>ing each other, " What victim next?" while the telegraph was sending the
</p>
<p>news from city to city over the continent, and while the two assassins
</p>
<p>were speeding unharmed upon fleet horses far away  his chosen friends
</p>
<p>watched about the death-bed of the highest of the nation. Occasionally
</p>
<p>Dr. Gurley, pastor of the church where Mr. Lincoln habitually attended,
</p>
<p>knelt down in prayer. Occasionally Mrs. Lincoln and her sons, entered, to
</p>
<p>find no hope and to go back to ceaseless weeping. Members of the cabi-
</p>
<p>net, senat(jrs, representatives, generals, and others, took turns at the bed-
</p>
<p>side. Chief-Justice Chase remained until a late hour, and returned in the
</p>
<p>morning. Secretary McCuUoch remained a constant watcher until 5 a. m.
</p>
<p>Not a gleam of consciousness shone across the visage of the President up
</p>
<p>to his death  a quiet, peaceful death at last  which came at twenty-two
</p>
<p>minutes past seven a. m. Around the bedside at this time were Secreta-
</p>
<p>ries Stanton, Welles, Usher, Attorney-General Speed, Postmaster-General
</p>
<p>Dennison, M. B. Field, Assistant Secratary of the Treasury, Judge Otto,
</p>
<p>Assistant Secretary of the Interior, General Halleck, General Meigs,
</p>
<p>Senator Sumner, F. R. Andrews, of New- York, General Todd, of Dacotah,
</p>
<p>John Hay, private secretary. Governor Oglesby, of Illinois, General
</p>
<p>Farnsworth, Mrs. and Miss Kenny, Miss Harris, Captain Robert Lincoln,
</p>
<p>son of the President, and Drs. E. W. Abbott, R. K. Stone, C. D. Gatch,
</p>
<p>Neal Hall, and Leiberman. Rev, Dr. Gurley, after the event, knelt with
</p>
<p>all around in prayer, and then, entering the adjoining room where v/ere
</p>
<p>gathered Mrs. Lincoln, Captain Robert Lincoln, Mr. John Hay, and others,
</p>
<p>prayed again. Soon after 9 o'clock the remains were placed in a tempora-
</p>
<p>ry coffin and conveyed to the White House under a small escort.
</p>
<p>In Secretary Seward's chamber, a similar although not so solemn a
</p>
<p>soene prevailed; between that chamber and the one occupied by President
</p>
<p>Lincoln, visitors alternated to and fro through the night. It had been
</p>
<p>early ascertained that the wounds of the secretary were not likely to prove
</p>
<p>mortal. A wire instrument, to relieve the* pain which he suffered from
</p>
<p>previous injuries, prevented the knife of the assassin from striking too
</p>
<p>deep. Mr. Frederick Seward's injuries were more serious. His forehead
</p>
<p>was broken in by the blow from the pistol, and up to this hour he has re-
</p>
<p>mained perfectly unconscious. The operation of trepanning the skull has

<p>been performed, but little hope is had of his recovery. Major Seward
</p>
<p>will get well. Mr. Ilansell's condition is somewhat doubtful.
</p>
<p>Secretary Seward, who cannot speak, was not informed of the assassina-
</p>
<p>tion of the President, and the injury of his son, until yesterday. He had
</p>
<p>been worrying as to why Mr. Lincoln did not visit him. " Why does'nt
</p>
<p>the President come to see me ?" he asked with his pencil. " Where is
</p>
<p>Frederick  what is the matter with him ?" Perceiving the nervous ex-
</p>
<p>citement which these doubts occasioned, a consultation was had, at which
</p>
<p>it was finally determined that it would be best to let the secretary know
</p>
<p>the worst. Secretary Stanton was chosen to tell him. Sitting down be-
</p>
<p>side Mr. Seward's bed, yesterday afternoon, he therefore related to him a
</p>
<p>full account of the whole affair. Mr. Seward was so surprised and shocked
</p>
<p>that he raised one hand involuntarily, and groaned. Such is the condition
</p>
<p>of affairs at tnis stage of the terror. The pursuit of the assassins has com-
</p>
<p>menced ; the town is full of wild and baseless rumors ; much that is said
</p>
<p>is stirring , little is reliable. I tell it to you a."* I get it, but filncy is more

</p>
<p>LETTER II.
</p>
<p>THE OBSEaUIES IN WASHINGTON.
</p>
<p>Washington, April 19, (Evening).
</p>
<p>The most significant and most creditable celebration ever held in Wash-
</p>
<p>mgton has just transpired. A good ruler has been followed from his home
</p>
<p>to the Capitol by a grand cortege, worthy of the memory and of the
</p>
<p>nation's power. As description must do injustice to the extent of the dis-
</p>
<p>play, so must criticism fail to sufficiently commend its perfect tastefulness.
</p>
<p>Karely has a Republican assemblage been so orderly. The funeral of Mr.
</p>
<p>Lincoln is something to be remembered for a cycle. It caps all eulogy
</p>
<p>upon his life and services, and was, without exception, the most representa-
</p>
<p>tive, spontaneous, and remarkable testimonial ever rendered to the remains
</p>
<p>of an American citizen.
</p>
<p>The night before the funeral showed the probable character of the cortege.
</p>
<p>At Wiliard's alone four hundred applications by telegraph for beds were
</p>
<p>refused. As many as six thousand persons spent Tuesday night in the
</p>
<p>streets, in depots and in outbuildings. The population of the city this
</p>
<p>morning was not far short of a hundred thousand, and of these as many as
</p>
<p>thirty thousand walked in procession with Mr. .Lincoln's ashes.
</p>
<p>All orders of folks were at hand. The country adjacent sent in hay-
</p>
<p>wagons, donkey-carts, dearborns. All who could slip away from the army
</p>
<p>came to town, and every attainable section of the Union forwarded
</p>
<p>mourners. At no time in his life had Mr. Lincoln so many to throng
</p>
<p>about him as in this hour, when he is powerless to do any one a service.
</p>
<p>For once in history, office-seekers were disinterested, and contractors and
</p>
<p>hangers-on human. These came, for this time only, to the capital of the
</p>
<p>republic without an axe to grind or a curiosity to subserve ; respect and
</p>
<p>grief were all their motive. This day was shown that tKe great public
</p>
<p>heart beats unselfish and reverent, even after a dynasty of plunder and
</p>
<p>war.
</p>
<p>The arrangements for the funeral were made by Mr. Harrington, Assist-
</p>
<p>ant-Secretary of the Treasury, who was beset by applicants for tickets.
</p>
<p>The number of these were reduced to six hundred, the clergy getting sixty
</p>
<p>and the press twenty. I was among the first to pass the White House

</p>
<p>guards and enter the building.
</p>
<p>Its freestone columns were draped in black, and all the windows were
</p>
<p>funereal. The ancient reception-room was half closed, and the famous
</p>
<p>East room, which is approached by a spacious hall, had been reserved for
</p>
<p>the obsequies. There are none present hei-e but a few silent attendants of
</p>
<p>the late owner of the republican palace. Deeply ensconced in the white
</p>
<p>satin stuffing of his coffin, the President lies like one asleep. The broad,
</p>
<p>high, beautiful room is like the varnished interior of a vault. The fres-
</p>
<p>coed ceiling wears the national shield, some pointed vases filled with flowers
</p>
<p>and fruit, and three emblazonings of gilt pendant from which are shroudea
</p>
<p>chandeliers. A purplish gray is the prevailing tint of the ceiling. The
</p>
<p>cornice is silver'white, set off* by a velvet crimson. The wall paper is gold
</p>
<p>and red, broken by eight lofty mirrors, which are chastely margined with
</p>
<p>black and faced with fleece.
</p>
<p>Their imperfect surfaces reflect the lofty catafalque, an open canopy of
</p>
<p>solemn alapaca, lined with tasteful satin of creamish lead, looped at the
</p>
<p>curving roof and dropping t< the four corners in half transparent tapestry.
</p>
<p>Beneath the roof the half light shines upon a stage of fresh and fragrant

</p>
<p>flowers, up-bearing a long, high coffin. White lace of pure silver pendant
</p>
<p>from the border throws a mild shimmer upon the solid silver tracery
</p>
<p>hinges and emblazonings. A cross of lilies stands at the head, an anchor
</p>
<p>of roses at the foot. The lid is drawn back to show the face and bosom,
</p>
<p>and on the coffin top are heather, precious flowers, and sprigs of green.
</p>
<p>This catafalque, or in plain words, this coffin set upon a platform and
</p>
<p>canopied, has around it a sufficient space of Brussels carpet, and on three
</p>
<p>sides of this there are raised steps covered with black, on which the
</p>
<p>honored visitors are to stand.
</p>
<p>The fourth side is bare, save of a single row of chairs some twenty in
</p>
<p>number, on which the reporters are to sit. The odor of the room is fresh
</p>
<p>and healthy; the shade is solemn, without being oppressive. All is rich,
</p>
<p>simple, and spacious, and in such sort as any king might wish to lie.
</p>
<p>Approach and look at the dead man.
</p>
<p>Death has fastened into bis frozen face all the character and idiosyncrasy
</p>
<p>of life. He has not changed one line of his grave, grotesque countenance,
</p>
<p>nor smoothed out a single feature. The hue is rather bloodless and leaden ;
</p>
<p>but he was alway sallow. The dark eyebrows seem abruptly arched ; the
</p>
<p>beard, which will grow no more, is shaved close, save the tuft at the short
</p>
<p>small chin. The mouth is shut, like that of one who had put the foot
</p>
<p>down firm, and so are the eyes, which look as calm as slumber. The collar
</p>
<p>is short and awkward, turned over the stiff elastic cravat, and whatever
</p>
<p>energy or humor or tender gravity marked the living face is hardened into
</p>
<p>its pulseless outline. No corpse in the world is better prepared according
</p>
<p>to appearances. The white'satin around it reflects sufficient light upon the
</p>
<p>face to show us that death is really there ; but there are sweet roses and
</p>
<p>early magnolias, and the balmiest of lilies strewn around, as if the flowers
</p>
<p>had begun to bloom even upon his coffin. Looking on uninterruptedly !
</p>
<p>for there is no pressure, and henceforward the place will be thronged with
</p>
<p>gazers who will take from the sight its suggestiveness and respect. Three
</p>
<p>years ago, when little Willie Lincoln died. Doctors Brown and Alexander,
</p>
<p>the embalmers or injectors, prepared his body so handsomely that the
</p>
<p>President had it twice disinterred to look upon it. The same men, in the
</p>
<p>same way, have made perpetual these beloved lineaments. There is now

</p>
<p>no blood in the body ; it was drained by the jugular vein and sacredly pre-
</p>
<p>served, and through a cutting on the inside of the thigh the empty blood-
</p>
<p>vessels were charged with a chemical preparation which soon hardened to
</p>
<p>the consistence of stone. The long and bony body is now hard and stifle,
</p>
<p>so that beyond its present position it cannot be moved any more than the
</p>
<p>arms or legs of a statue. It has undergone many changes. The scalp hiis
</p>
<p>been removed, the brain taken out, the chest opened and the blood emptied.
</p>
<p>All that we see of Abraham Lincoln, so cunningly contemplated in this
</p>
<p>splendid coffin, is a mere shell, an effigy, a sculpture. He lies ir sleep,
</p>
<p>but it is the sleep of marble. AH that made this flesh vital, sentient, and
</p>
<p>affectionate is gone forever.
</p>
<p>The officers present are Generals Hunter and Dyer and two staflf" cap-
</p>
<p>tains. Hunter, compact and dark and reticent, walks about the empty
</p>
<p>chamber in full uniform, his bright buttons and sash and sword contrasting
</p>
<p>with his dark blue uniform, gauntlets upon his hands, crape on his arm and
</p>
<p>blade, his corded hat in his hands, a paper collar just apparent above his
</p>
<p>velvet tips, and now and then he spealLs to Captain Nesmith or Captain
</p>
<p>Dewes, of General Harding's staff", rather as one who wishes company than
</p>
<p>one who has anything to SF.y. His two silver stars upon his shoulder shine
</p>
<p>Aiasdy in the draped apartmftnt. He was one of the first in the war to
</p>
<p>Tlie Obsequiet at Washington. 15
</p>
<p>urge the measures which Mr. Lincoln afterward adopted. The aids walk
</p>
<p>to and fro, selected without reference to any association with the late Pres-
</p>
<p>ident. Their clothes are rich, their swords wear mourning, they go in
</p>
<p>silence, everything is funereal. In the deeply-draped mirrrors strange
</p>
<p>mirages are seen, as in the coffin scene of " Lucretia Borgia," where all the
</p>
<p>dusky perspectives bear vistas of gloomy palls. The upholsterers make
</p>
<p>timid noises of driving nails and spreading tapestry ; but save ourselven
</p>
<p>and these few watchers and workers, only the dead is here. The White
</p>
<p>House, so ill-appreciated in common times, is seen to be capacious and ele-
</p>
<p>gant  no disgrace to the nation even in the eyes of those foreign folk of
</p>
<p>rank who shall gather here directly.
</p>
<p>As we sit brooding, with the pall straight before us, the funeral guns arc
</p>
<p>heard indistinctly booming from the far forts, with the tap of drums in the
</p>
<p>serried street without, where troops and citizen's are forming for the grand pro-
</p>
<p>cession. We see through the window in the beautiful spring day that the
</p>
<p>grass is brightly green ; and all the trees in blossom, show us through their
</p>
<p>archways the bronze and marble statues breaking the horizon. But there
</p>
<p>is one at an upper window, seeing all this through her tears, to whom tho
</p>
<p>beautiful noon, with its Wealth of zephyrs and sweets, can waft no gratula-
</p>
<p>tion. The father of her children, the confidant of her affection and ambi-
</p>
<p>tion, has passed from life into immortality, and lies below, dumb, cold,
</p>
<p>murdered. The feeling of sympathy for Mrs. Lincoln is as wide-spread as
</p>
<p>the regret for the chief magistrate. Whatever indiscretions she may have
</p>
<p>committed in the abrupt transition from plainness to power are now for-
</p>
<p>given and forgotten. She and her sons are the property of the nation,
</p>
<p>associated with its truest glories and its worst bereavement. By and by
</p>
<p>the guests drop in, hat in hand, wearing upon their sleeves waving crape,
</p>
<p>and some of them slip up to the coffin to carry away a last impression of
</p>
<p>the fadinjj face.
</p>
<p>But the first accession of force is that of the clergy, sixty in number.
</p>
<p>They are devout looking men, darkly attired, and have come from all the
</p>
<p>neighboring cities to represent every denomination. Five years ago these
</p>
<p>were wrangling over slavery as a theological question, and at the beginning
</p>
<p>of the war it was hard, in many of their bodies, to carry loyal resolutions.

</p>
<p>To-day there are here such sincere mourners as Robert Pattison, of the
</p>
<p>Methodist church, who passed much of his life among slaves and masters.
</p>
<p>He and the rest have come to believe that the President was wise and
</p>
<p>right, and follow him to his grave, as the apostles the interred on calvary.
</p>
<p>All these retire to the south end of the room, facing the feet of the
</p>
<p>corpse, and stand there silently to wait for the coming of others. Very
</p>
<p>soon this East room is filled with the representative intelligence of the
</p>
<p>entire nation. The governors of states stand on the dais next to the head
</p>
<p>of the coffin, with the varied features of Curtin, Brough, Fenton, Stone,
</p>
<p>Oglesby and Ingraham. Behind them are the mayors and councilmen of
</p>
<p>many towns paying their last respects to the representative of the source
</p>
<p>of all municipal freedom. To their left are the corporate officers of Wash-
</p>
<p>ington, zealous to make this day's funeral honors atone for the shame of the
</p>
<p>assassination. With these are sprinkled many scarred and worthy soldiers
</p>
<p>yrho have borne the burden of the grand war, and stand before this shape
</p>
<p>they loved in quiet civil reverence.
</p>
<p>Still further down the steps and closer to the catafalque rest the familiar
</p>
<p>faces of many of our greatest generals  the manly features of Augur,
</p>
<p>whose blood I have seen trickling forth upon the field of battle ; the open
</p>
<p>almost bftardlfts5 contour of Haiieek, who has often talked of seiges and
</p>
<p>V\
</p>
<p>16 Tht Life, Crime, and Capture, of John Wilkes Booth.
</p>
<p>campaigns with this homely gentleman who is going to the grave. There
</p>
<p>are many more bright stars twinkling in contiguous shoulder bars, but sit-
</p>
<p>ting in a chair upon the beflowered carpet is Ulysses Grant, who has lived
</p>
<p>a century in the last three weeks and comes to-day to add the luster of his
</p>
<p>iron face to this thrilling and saddened picture. He wears white gloves and
</p>
<p>sash, and is swarthy, nervous, and almost tearful, his feet crossed, his
</p>
<p>square receding head turning now here now there, his treble constellation
</p>
<p>blazing upon the letl shoulder only, but hidden on the right, and I seem to
</p>
<p>read upon his compact features the indurate and obstinate will to fight, on
</p>
<p>the line he has selected, the honor of the country through any peril, as if
</p>
<p>he had sworn it by the slain man's bier  his state-fellow, patron, and
</p>
<p>friend. Here also is General McCallum, who has seamed the rebellious
</p>
<p>South with military roads to send victory along them, and bring back the
</p>
<p>groaning and the scarred. These and the rest are grand historic figures,
</p>
<p>worthy of all artistic depiction. The_y nave looked so often into the mor-
</p>
<p>tar's mouth, that no bravo's blade can make them wince. Do you see the
</p>
<p>thin-haired, conical head of the viking Farragut, close by General Grant,
</p>
<p>with many naval heroes close behind, storm-beaten, and every inch Ameri-
</p>
<p>cans in thought and physiognomy 1
</p>
<p>What think the foreign ambassadors of such men, in the light of their
</p>
<p>own overloaded bodies, where meaningless orders, crosses, and ribboaa
</p>
<p>shine dimly in the funeral light? These legations number, perhaps, a hun-
</p>
<p>dred men, of all civilized races,  the Sardinian envoy, jetty-eyed, towering
</p>
<p>above the rest. But they are still and respectful, gathered thus by a slain 
</p>
<p>ruler, to see how worthy is the republic he has preserved. Whatever
</p>
<p>sympathy these have for our institutions, I think that in such audience they
</p>
<p>must have been impressed with the futility of any thought that either one
</p>
<p>citizen right or one territorial inch can ever be torn from the United StJtes. '
</p>
<p>Not to speak disparagingly of these noble guests, 1 was struck with the
</p>
<p>superior facial energy of our own public servants, who were generally
</p>
<p>larger, and brighter-faced, born of that aristocracy which took its patent
</p>
<p>from Tubal Cain, and Abel the goatherd, and graduated in Abraham Lin-
</p>
<p>coln. The Haytien minister, swarthy and fiery -faced, is conspicuous
</p>
<p>among these.

</p>
<p>But nearer down, and just opposite the catafalque so that it is perpen-
</p>
<p>dicular to the direction of vision, stand the central powers of our govern-
</p>
<p>ment, its President and counsellors. President Johnson is facing the middle
</p>
<p>of the coffin upon the lowest step ; his hands are crossed upon his breast,
</p>
<p>his dark clothing just revealing his plaited shirt, and upon his full, plethoric,
</p>
<p>shaven face, broad and severely compact, two telling gray eyes rest under
</p>
<p>a thoughtful brow, whose turning hair is straight and smooth. Beside him
</p>
<p>are Vice-President Hamlin, whom he succeeded, and ex-Governor King, his
</p>
<p>most intimate friend, who lends to the ruling severity of the place a half
</p>
<p>Falstaftian episode. The cabinet are behind, as if arranged for a daguer-
</p>
<p>reotypist, Stanton, short and quicksilvery, in long goatee and glasses, in
</p>
<p>stunted contrast to the tall and snow-tipped shape of Mr. Welles with the
</p>
<p>rest, practiciil and attentive, and at their side is Secretary Chase, high, dig-
</p>
<p>nified, and handsome, with folded arms, listening, but undemonstrative, a
</p>
<p>half foot higher than any spectator, and dividing with Charles Sumner, who
</p>
<p>is near by, the preference for manly beauty in age. With Mr. Chase are
</p>
<p>other justices of the Supreme Court, and to their left, near the feet of the
</p>
<p>corpse, are the reverend senators, representing the oldest and the newest
</p>
<p>states  splendid faces, a little worn with early and later toils, backed up
</p>
<p>by the high, classical features of Colonel Forney, their secretary. Beyond
</p>
<p>The Obsequies at Washington. 17
</p>
<p>are the representatives and leading officials of the various departments,
</p>
<p>with a few odd folks like George Prancis Train, exquisite as ever, and, for
</p>
<p>this time only, with nothing to say.
</p>
<p>Close by the corpse sit the relatives of the deceased, plain, -honest,
</p>
<p>hardy people, rypical as much of the simplicity of our institutions as of
</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln's self-made eminence. No blood relatives of Mr. Lincoln
</p>
<p>were to be found. It is a singular evidence of the poverty of his origin,
</p>
<p>and therefore of his exceeding good report, that, excepting his immediate
</p>
<p>family, none answering to his name could be discovered. Mrs. Lincoln's
</p>
<p>relatives were pi-esent, however, in some force. Dr. Lyman Beecher Todd,
</p>
<p>General John B. S. Todd, C. M. Smith, Esq., and Mr. N. \V. Edwards,
</p>
<p>the late President's brother-in-law, plain, self-made people were here and
</p>
<p>were sincerely atfected. Captain Robert Lincoln sat during the services
</p>
<p>with his face in his handkerchief weeping quietly, and litt|.e Tad his face
</p>
<p>red and heated, cried as if his heart would break. Mrs. Lincoln, weak,
</p>
<p>worn, and nervous, did not enter the East room nor follow the remains.
</p>
<p>She was the chief magistrate's lady yesterday ; to-day a widow bearing
</p>
<p>only an immortal name. Among the neighbors of the late President, who
</p>
<p>came from afar to pay respect to his remains, was one old gentleman who
</p>
<p>left Richmond on Sunday. I had been upon the boat with him and heard
</p>
<p>him iir hot wrangle with some officers who advised the summary execution
</p>
<p>of all rebel leaders. This the old man opposed, when the feeling against
</p>
<p>Bim became so intense that he was compelled to retire. He counselled
</p>
<p>mercy, good faith, and forgiveness. To-day, the men who had called him a
</p>
<p>traitor, saw him among the family mourners, bent with grief. All these
</p>
<p>are waiting in solemn lines, standing erect, with a space of several feet be-
</p>
<p>tween them and the coffin, and there is no bustle nor unseemly curiosity,
</p>
<p>not a whisper, not a footfall  only the collected nation looking with awed
</p>
<p>hearts upon eminent death.
</p>
<p>This scene is historic. I regret that I must tell you of it ovev a little
</p>
<p>wire, for it admits of all exemplification. In this high, -spacious, elegant
</p>
<p>apartment, yfaughter and levee, social pleasantry and refined badinage, had
</p>
<p>often held their session. Dancing and music had made those mirrors thrill
</p>
<p>which now reflect a pall, and where the most beautiful women of their day

</p>
<p>had mingled here with men of brilliant favor, now only a very few, brave
</p>
<p>enough to look upon deaj;h, were wearing funeral weeds. The pleasant
</p>
<p>face of Mrs. Kate Sprague looks out from these ; but such scenes gain little
</p>
<p>additional power by beauty's presence. And this wonderful relief was
</p>
<p>carved at one blow by John Wilkes Booth.
</p>
<p>The religious services began at noon. They were remarkable not only
</p>
<p>for their association with the national event, but for a tremendous political
</p>
<p>energy Vhich they had. While none of the prayers or speeches exhibited
</p>
<p>great literary carefulness, or will obtain perpetuity on their own merits,
</p>
<p>they were full of feeling and expressed all the intense concern of the
</p>
<p>country.
</p>
<p>The procession surpassed in sentiment, populousness, and sincere good
</p>
<p>feeling, anything of the kind we have had in America. It was several miles
</p>
<p>long, and in all its elements was full and tasteful. The scene on the avenue
</p>
<p>will be alway remembered as the only occasion on which that great thorough-
</p>
<p>fare was a real adornment to the seat of government. In the tree tops, on
</p>
<p>the house tops, at all the windows, the silent and affected crowds clustered
</p>
<p>beneath half mast banners and waving crape, to reverentially uncover as
</p>
<p>the dark vehicle, bearing its rich silver-mounted coffin, swept along ; mot^
</p>
<p>toes of respect ftnd honiage were on many edifices, and singularly some of
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>18 The Life, Crime and Capture of John Wilkes Booth.
</p>
<p>them were taken from the play of Richard III., which was the murderers
</p>
<p>favorite part. The entire width of the avenue was swept, from curb to
</p>
<p>curb, by the deep lines.
</p>
<p>The chief excellence of this procession was its representative nature. All
</p>
<p>classes, localities and trades were out. As the troops in broad, straight
</p>
<p>.-olumns, with reversed muskets, moved to solemn marches, all the guns on*
</p>
<p>the fortifications on the surrounding hills discharged hoarse salutes guns
</p>
<p>which the arbiter of war whom they were to honor could hear no longer.
</p>
<p>Every business place was closed. Sabermen swept the street of footmen
</p>
<p>and horsemen. The carriages drove two abreast.
</p>
<p>Not less than five thousand officers, of every rank, marched abreast with
</p>
<p>the corte<Te. They were noble looking men with intelligent faces, and rep-
</p>
<p>resented 'the sinews of the land, and the music was not the least excellent
</p>
<p>feature of the#nournful display. About thirty bands were in the line, and
</p>
<p>these played all varieties of solemn marches, so that there were continual
</p>
<p>and mingling strains ef funeral music for more than three hours. Artillery,
</p>
<p>consistino- of heavy brass pieces, followed behind. In fact, all the citizen
</p>
<p>virtues a'lid all the military enterprise of the country were evidenced.
</p>
<p>Never attain, until Washington becomes in fact what it is in name, the chief
</p>
<p>city of America, shall we have a scene like this repeated the grandest pro-
</p>
<p>cession ever seen on this continent, spontaneously evoked to celebrate the
</p>
<p>foulest crime on record. If any feeling of gratulation could arise in so cala-
</p>
<p>mitous a time, it would be, that so soon after this appalling calamity the
</p>
<p>nation calmly and collectedly rallied about its succeeding rulers, and showed
</p>
<p>in the same moment its regret for the past and its resolution for the future.
</p>
<p>To me, the scene in the White House, the street, and the capitol to-day,
</p>
<p>Avas the strongest evidence the war afforded of the stability of our mstitu-
</p>
<p>tions, and the worthiness and magnanimous power of our people.
</p>
<p>The cortege passed to the left side of the Capitol, and entering the great
</p>
<p>gates, passed to the grand stairway, opposite the splendid dome, where the
</p>
<p>coffin was disengaged and carried up the ascent. It was posted under the
</p>
<p>bright concave, now streaked with mournful trappings, and left in state,
</p>
<p>watched by guards of officers with drawn swords. This was a wonderful spec-
</p>
<p>tacle, the man most beloved and honored in the ark of the republic. The

<p>storied paintings representing eras in its history were draped in sable,
</p>
<p>through which they seemed to cast reverential glances upon the lamented
</p>
<p>bier. \he thrilling scenes depicted by Trumbull, the commemorative can-
</p>
<p>vase's of Leutze, the wilderness vegetation of Powell, glared from their sep-
</p>
<p>erate pedestals upon the central spot where lay the fallen majesty of the
</p>
<p>countrv. Here the prayers ^nd addresses of the noon were rehearsed and
</p>
<p>the solemn burial service read. At nigjit the jets of gas concealed
</p>
<p>in the spring of the dome were lighted up, so that their bright reflection
</p>
<p>upon the frescoed walls hurled m^isses of 'burning light, like marvelous
</p>
<p>haloes, upon the little box where somach that we love and honor rested on
</p>
<p>its way to the grave. And so through the starry night, in the fane of the
</p>
<p>great Union he had strengthened and recovered, the ashes of Abraham
</p>
<p>Lincoln, zealously guarded, are now reposing. The sage, the citizen, the
</p>
<p>patriot, the man, has reached all the eminence that life can give the worthy
</p>
<p>or the ambitious. The hunted fugitive who struck through our hearts to
</p>
<p>slay him, should stand beside his stately bier to see how powerless are
</p>
<p>bullets and blades to take the real life of any noble man !

<p>The Murderer. 19
</p>
<p>LETTERIII.
</p>
<p>THE MURDERER,.
</p>
<p>Wasi&njoton, April 27tli.
</p>
<p>Justice is satisfied, though blinder vengeance may not be. While the
</p>
<p>illustrious murdered is on the way to the shrine, the stark corpse of his
</p>
<p>murderer lies in the shambles. The one died quietly, like his life; the
</p>
<p>other died tightins:, like his crime. And now that over all of them the
</p>
<p>darkness and the dewliave descended, the populace, which may not be all
</p>
<p>satisfied, may perhaps be calmed. No triumphal mourning can add to the
</p>
<p>President's glory ; no further execration can disturb the assiissin's slum-
</p>
<p>bers. They have gone for what they were into history, into tradition, into
</p>
<p>the hereafter both of men and spirits ; aud what they were may be in part
</p>
<p>concluded. Mr. Lincoln's career passes, in extent, gravity, and eventful
</p>
<p>association, the province of newspaper biography ; but Booth is the hero
</p>
<p>of a single deed, and the delineation of him may begin and be exhausted
</p>
<p>in a single article. I have been at pains, since the day of the President's
</p>
<p>obsequies, to collect all valid information on the subject of his assassin,
</p>
<p>in anticipation of the latter's capture and death. Now that these have
</p>
<p>been consummated, I shall print this biography.
</p>
<p>The elder Booth in every land was a sojourner, as all his fathers were.
</p>
<p>Of Hebrew descent, and by a line of actors, he united in himself that strong
</p>
<p>Jewish physiognomy which, in its nobler phases, makes all that is dark and
</p>
<p>beautiful, and the combined vagrancy of all men of genius and all men of
</p>
<p>the stage. Fitful, powerful, passionate, his life was a succession of vices
</p>
<p>and triumphs. He mastered the intricate characters of dramatic literature
</p>
<p>bv intuition, rather than by study, and produced them with a vigor and
</p>
<p>vividness which almost passed the depicting of real life. The stage on
</p>
<p>which he raved and fought became as historic as the actual decks of battle
</p>
<p>ships, and his small and brawny figure cmes down to us in those parox-
</p>
<p>ysms of delirious art, like that of Harold, or Richard, or Prince Rupert,
</p>
<p>He drank to excess, was profligate but not generous, required but not re-
</p>
<p>liable, and licentious to the bounds of cruelty. He threw off the^^ife of
</p>
<p>his bosom to fly from England with a flower-girl, and, settling in Balti-
</p>
<p>more, dwelt with his younger companion, and brought up many children,

<p>while his first^possessed went down to a drunken and broken-hearted death'.
</p>
<p>He himself, wandering westward, died on the way, errant and feverish,
</p>
<p>even in the closing moments. His widow, too conscious of her predeces-
</p>
<p>sor's wrongs, and often taunted with them, lived apart, frugal and discreet,
</p>
<p>and brought her six children up to honorable maturity. These were
</p>
<p>Junius Brutus, Edwin Forrest (though he drops the Forrest for professional
</p>
<p>considerations), John Wilkes, Joseph, and the girls. All of the boys are
</p>
<p>known to more or less of fame ; none of them in his art has reached the
</p>
<p>renowh of the father; but. one has sent his name as far as that of the great
</p>
<p>plavwright to whom they were pupils ; wherever Shakspeare is quoted,
</p>
<p>John Wilkes Booth will be named, and infamously, like that Hubert in
</p>
<p>" King John," who would have murdered the gentle Prince Arthur.
</p>
<p>It may not be a digression here to ask what has become of the children
</p>
<p>of the weird genius I have sketched above. Mrs. Booth, against whom
</p>
<p>calumnv has had no word to say, now resides with her daughters in Nine-
</p>
<p>teenth street, New-York. John S. Clarke dwells in princely style in Phil
</p>
<p>adelphia, with the daughter whom he married ; he is the business partner
</p>
<p>of Edwin Booth, and they are likely to become as powerful managers as

</p>
<p>they have been successful "stars." Edwhi Booth, who is said to have the
</p>
<p>most perfect physical head in America, and whom the hidies call the beau
</p>
<p>ideal of the inelanchuly Dane, dwells also on Nineteenth street. He has
</p>
<p>acquired a fortune, a(^ is, without doubt, a frankly loyal gentleman. He
</p>
<p>could not well be otherwise from his membership in the Century Club,
</p>
<p>where literature and loyalty, are never dissolved. Correct and pleasing
</p>
<p>without being powerful or brilliant, he has led a plain and appreciated
</p>
<p>career, and latterly, to his honor, has been awakening among dramatic
</p>
<p>authors some emulation by offering handsome compensations for original
</p>
<p>plays. Junius Brutus Booth, the oldest of them all, most resembles in
</p>
<p>feature his wild and wayward father ; he is not as good an actor as was
</p>
<p>Wilkes, and kept in the West, that border civilization of the drama; he
</p>
<p>now lies, on a serious charge of complicity, in Capitol Hill jail. Joseph
</p>
<p>Booth tried the stage as an utility actor and promptly failed. The best part
</p>
<p>he ever had to play Vl-as Orson in the " Iri>n Chest," and his discomfiture
</p>
<p>was signal ; then he studied medicine but grew discouraged, and is no\v'*in
</p>
<p>California in an office of some sort. A son of Booth by his first wife be-
</p>
<p>came a first-class lawyer in Boston. He never recognized the rest of the
</p>
<p>family. Wilkes Booth, the third son, was shot dead on Wednesday for
</p>
<p>attempting to escape from the consequences of murder. Such are the
</p>
<p>people to whom one of the greatest actors of our time gave his. name and
</p>
<p>lineaments. But I have anticipated the story :
</p>
<p>Although her family was large, it was not so hard sailiag with Mrs. Ro-
</p>
<p>salie Booth as may be inferred. Her husband's gains had been variably 
</p>
<p>great, and they owned a farm of some value near Baltimore. The boys
</p>
<p>had plain but not sufficient schooling, though by the time John Wilkes
</p>
<p>grew up Edwin and Junius were making some little money aiid helping
</p>
<p>the family. So Wilkes was sent to a better school than they, where he
</p>
<p>made some eventful acquaintances. One of these won his admiration as
</p>
<p>much in the playground as in subsequent life upon the field of battle ; this
</p>
<p>was Fitzhujjh Lee, son of the great rebel chieftain. 1 have not heard that
</p>
<p>Lee ever had any friendship for young Wilkes, but his port and name

</p>
<p>were enough to excite a less ardent imagination  the son of a soldier al-
</p>
<p>ready great, and a descendant of Washington. Wilkes Booth has often ,
</p>
<p>spoken of the memory of the young man, envied his success, and, perhaps,
</p>
<p>boasted of more intimacy than he ever had. The exemplars of young
</p>
<p>Wilkes, it was soon seen, were anything but literary. He hated school
</p>
<p>and pent-up life, and loved the open air. He used to stroll ofi' to fish,
</p>
<p>though that sort of amusement was too sedentary for his nature, but went
</p>
<p>on fowling jaunts with enthusiasm. In these latter he manifested that fine
</p>
<p>nerve, and certain eye, which was the talk of all his associates ; but his
</p>
<p>greatebi love was the stable. He learned to ride with his first pair of
</p>
<p>boots, fviid hung around the grooms to beg permission to take the nags to
</p>
<p>water. He grew in later life to be both an indurated and a graceful
</p>
<p>horseman. Toward his mother and sisters he was affectionate without
</p>
<p>be;ng obedient. Of all the sons, Wilkes was the most headstrong in-doors,
</p>
<p>and the most contented away from home. He had a fitful gentleness
</p>
<p>which won him forgiveness, and of one of his sisters he was particularly
</p>
<p>fond, but none had influence over him. He was seldom contentious, but
</p>
<p>obstinately bent, and what he willed, he did in silence, seeming to discard
</p>
<p>sympathy or confidence. As a boy he was never bright, except in a boy's
</p>
<p>sense; tiiat is, he could run and leap well, fight when challenged, and gen-
</p>
<p>erally fell in with the sentiment of the crowd. He therefore made :i:any
</p>
<p>,| The Murderer. 21
</p>
<p>ODmpanions, ai.d his early days all passed between Baltimore city and the
</p>
<p>adjacent farm.
</p>
<p>I have heard it said as the only evidence of Booth's ferocity in those
</p>
<p>early times that he was alwa\!> snooting cats, and killed off almost the
</p>
<p>entire breed in his neighbourhood. But on more than one occasion he ran
</p>
<p>away from both school and home, and once made the trip of the Chesa-
</p>
<p>peake to the oyster fisheries without advising anybody of his family.
</p>
<p>Yv'hile yet very young, Wilkes Booth became an habitue at the theater.
</p>
<p>Ilis traditions and tastes were all in that direction. His blood was of the
</p>
<p>stage, like that of the Keans, the Kembles, and the Wallacks. He would
</p>
<p>not commence at the bottom of the ladder and climb from round to round,
</p>
<p>nor take part in more than a few Thespian efforts. One night, howe\er, a
</p>
<p>young actoi', wh was to have a benefit and wished to fill the house, re-
</p>
<p>solved for the better purpose to give Wilkes a chance. He announced
</p>
<p>that a son of the great Booth of tradition, would enact the part of Rich-
</p>
<p>mond, and the announcement was enough. Before a crowded place, Booth
</p>
<p>played so badly that he was hissed. Still holding to his gossamer hopes
</p>
<p>atid high conceit, Wilkes induced John S. Clarke, who was then addressing
</p>
<p>his sister, to obtain him a position in the company of the Arch Street
</p>
<p>Theater at Philadelphia.
</p>
<p>For eight dollars a week, Wilkes Booth, at the agt, rf twenty-two, con-
</p>
<p>tracted with William Wheatley to play in any piece cr part for which he
</p>
<p>might be cast, and to appear every day at rehearsal. He had to play the
</p>
<p>Courier in Sheridan Knowles's " Wife" on his first night, with five op ten
</p>
<p>little speeches to make ; but such was his nervousness that he blundered
</p>
<p>continually, and quite balked the piece. Soon afterward he undertook the
</p>
<p>part of one of th^ Venetian comrades in Hugo's " Lucretia Borgia," and
</p>
<p>was to have said in his turn 
</p>
<p>' Madame, I am Petruchio Pandolfo ;" instead of which he exclaimed:
</p>
<p>" Madame, I am Pondolfio Pet  , Pedolfio Pat  , Pantuchio Ped  ;
</p>
<p>damn it ? what am I ?"
</p>
<p>The audience roared, and Booth, though full of chagrin, was compelled
</p>
<p>to laugh with them.
</p>
<p>The very next night he was to play Dawson, an important part in

</p>
<p>Moore's tragedy of " The Gamester." He had bought a new dress to wear
</p>
<p>on this night, and made abundant preparation to do himself honor. He
</p>
<p>therefore invited a lady whom he knew to visit the theater, and witness his
</p>
<p>triumph. But at the instant of his appearance on the stage, the audience,
</p>
<p>remembering the Petruchio Pandolfo of the previous nig' ., Durst into
</p>
<p>laughter, hisses, and mock applause, so that he was struck dumb, and
</p>
<p>stood rigid, with nothing whatever to say. Mr. John Dolman, to wh-,oe
</p>
<p>Stukely he played, was compelled, therefore, to strike Dawson entirely out
</p>
<p>of the piece.
</p>
<p>These occurrences nettled Booth, who protested that he studied fiiithfully
</p>
<p>but that his want of confidence ruined him. Mr. Fredericks the stage
</p>
<p>manager made constant complaints of Booth, w^ho by the way, did not
</p>
<p>play under his full name, but as Mr. J. Wilkes  and he bore the general
</p>
<p>reputation of having no promise, and being a careless fellow. He asso-
</p>
<p>ciated freely with such of the subordinate actors as he liked ; but being,
</p>
<p>through Clarke, then a rising fiivourite, of better connections, might, had
</p>
<p>he chosen, advanced himself socially, if not artistically. Clarke was to
</p>
<p>have a benefit one evening, and to enact, among other things, a mock
</p>
<p>Richard III., to which he allowed Wilkes Booth to play a real Richmond.
</p>
<p>On this occasion, for the first time, Booth showed some energy, and
</p>

</p>
<p>obtain some applause. But, in general, he was stumbling and worthless.
</p>
<p>I myself remember, on three consecutive nights, hearing him trip up and
</p>
<p>receive suppressed hisses. lie lacked enterprise ; other young actors, in-
</p>
<p>stead of waiting to be given better parts, committed them to memory, in
</p>
<p>the hope that their real interpreter might not come to hand. Amc^ng these
</p>
<p>I recall John McCullough, who afterwards became quite a celebrated
</p>
<p>actor. He was getting, if I correctly remember, only six dollars a week,
</p>
<p>while Booth obtained eight. Yet Wilkes Booth seemed too slow or indif-
</p>
<p>ferent to get on the weather side of such chances. He still held the part
</p>
<p>of third walking gentleman, and the third is always 'the first to be walked
</p>
<p>off in case of strait, as was Wilkes Booth. He did not survive forty
</p>
<p>weeks engagement, nor make above three hundred dollars in all that time.
</p>
<p>The Kellers arrived ; they cut down the company, and they dispensed with
</p>
<p>Wilkes Booth. He is remembered iu Philadelphia by his failure as in the
</p>
<p>world by his crime.
</p>
<p>About this time a manager named Kunkle gave Booth a salary of twenty
</p>
<p>dollars a week to go to the Richmond Theater. There he played a higher
</p>
<p>order of parts, and played them better, winning applauses from the easy
</p>
<p>provincial cities, and taking, as everywhere the ladies by storm. I have
</p>
<p>never wondered why many actors were strongly predisposed toward the
</p>
<p>South. There, their social status is nine times as big as with us. The hos-
</p>
<p>pitable, lounging, buzzing character of the southerner is entirely consonant
</p>
<p>with the cosmopolitanism of the stage, and that easy " hang-up-your-hat-
</p>
<p>ativeness," which is the rule and the demand in Thespianship. We place
</p>
<p>actors outside of society, and execrate them because they are there. The
</p>
<p>South took them into affable fellowship, and was not ruined by it, "but be
</p>
<p>loved by the fraternity. Booth played two seasons in Richmond, and left
</p>
<p>in some esteem.
</p>
<p>When the John Brown raid occured. Booth left the Richmond Theater
</p>
<p>for the scene of strife in a picked company with which he had affiliated for
</p>
<p>some time. From his connection with the militia on this occasion he was
</p>
<p>Wont to trace his fealty to Virginia. He was a non-commissioned officer,
</p>
<p>and remained at Charleston till after the execution, visiting the old pike-
</p>
<p>man in jail, and his company was selected to form guard around the scaf-

<p>fold when John Brown weiit, white-haired, to his account. There may be
</p>
<p>in this a consolation for the canonizers of the first arm-bearer between
</p>
<p>the sections, that one whose unit swelled the host to crush out that brave
</p>
<p>old life, to-^k from the scene inspiration enough to slay a merciful President
</p>
<p>in his unsusp.cting leisure. Booth never referred to John Brown's death
</p>
<p>in bravado ; possibly at that gallows began some such terrible purpose as
</p>
<p>he afterward consummated.
</p>
<p>It was close upon the beginning of the war when Booth resolved to
</p>
<p>transform himself from a stock actor to a " star." As many will read this
</p>
<p>who do not understand such distinctions, let me preface it by explaining
</p>
<p>that a " star" is an actor who belongs to no one theater, but travels from
</p>
<p>each to all, playing a few weeks at a time, and sustained in his chief char-
</p>
<p>acter ])y the regular or stock actors. A stock actor is a good actor, and a
</p>
<p>poor fool. A star is an advertisement in tights, who grows rich and cor
</p>
<p>rupts the public taste. Booth was a star, and being so, had an agent. The
</p>
<p>agent is a trumpeter who goes on before, writing the impartial notices which
</p>
<p>^ you see in the editorial columns of country papers and counting noses at
</p>
<p>the theater doors. Booth's agent was one ^latthew Canning, an exploded
</p>
<p>Philadelphia lawyer, who took to managing by passing the bar, and, J.
</p>
<p>Wilkes no longei, but our country's rising tragedian. J. Wilkes Booth,
</p>
<p>Th Murderer. 23
</p>
<p>0{>enod in Montgomery, Alabama, in his father's consecrated part of Richard
</p>
<p>III. It w;is very ditferent work between receiving eight dollars a week
</p>
<p>and getting half the gross proceeds of every performance. Booth kept
</p>
<p>northward when his engagment was done, playing in many cities such
</p>
<p>parts as Romeo, the Corsican Brothers, and Raphael in the " Marble Heart ;"
</p>
<p>in all of these he gained applause, and his journey eastward, ending in east-
</p>
<p>ern cities like Providence, Portland, and Boston was a long success, in part
</p>
<p>deserved. lu Boston he received especial commendation for his enactment
</p>
<p>of Richard.
</p>
<p>I have looked over this play, his best and favopite one, to see how close-
</p>
<p>ly the career of the crookback he so often delineated resembled his own.
</p>
<p>How like that fearful night of Richard on Bosworth Held must have
</p>
<p>been Booth's sleep in the barn at Port Royal, tortured by ghosts of victims
</p>
<p>all repeating.
</p>
<p>" When I was mortal my anointed body
</p>
<p>By thee was punched full of deadly holes:
</p>
<p>Think ou the Tower and me 1 Despair and die 1"
</p>
<p>Or this, from some of Booth's female victims :
</p>
<p>" Let me sit heavy on thy sonl to-morrow !
</p>
<p>I that was washed to death with fulsome wine ;
</p>
<p>Poor Clarence, by thy guile betrayed to death:
</p>
<p>To-morrow in the battle think on me ; despair and die 1"
</p>
<p>These terrible conjurations must have recalled how aptly the scene so
</p>
<p>often rehearsed by Booth, sword in hand, where, leaping from his bed, he
</p>
<p>cries in horror :
</p>
<p>" Give me another horse ! bind np my wounds 1
</p>
<p>Have mercy, Jesu ! Soft 1 I did but dream.
</p>
<p>Oh ! coward conscience how thou dost, afflict me I
</p>
<p>The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight I ,
</p>
<p>' Cold, nareful drops stand on my trembling flesh,
</p>
<p>"What do I fear? Myself? there is none else by :
</p>
<p>Is there a murderer here ? No I  Ye* !  I am I
</p>
<p>Then fly,  wliat from myself?

</p>
<p>By these starring engagments. Booth made incredible sums. His cash-
</p>
<p>book, for one single season, showed earnings dsposited in bank of twenty-
</p>
<p>two odd thousand dollars. In New York he did not get a hearing, except
</p>
<p>at a benefit or two : where he played parts not of his selection. In Phila-
</p>
<p>delphia his earlier failure predisposed the people to discard him, and they
</p>
<p>did. But he had made enough, and resolved to invest his winnings, The
</p>
<p>oil fever had just begun; he hired an agent, sent him to the western dis-
</p>
<p>tricts and gave him discretionary power ; his investments all turned out
</p>
<p>profitable.
</p>
<p>Booth died, as far as understood without debts. The day before the mur-
</p>
<p>der he paid an old friend a hundred dollars which he had borrowed two days
</p>
<p>previously. He banked at Jay Cook's in Washington, generally ; but
</p>
<p>turned most of his funds into stock and other matters. He gave eighty
</p>
<p>dollars eight month's ago for a part investing with others in a piece of
</p>
<p>S4 Tke Life, Crime, and Capture of John Wilkes Booth.
</p>
<p>western oil land. The certificate for this land he gave to his sister. Just
</p>
<p>before he died his agent informed him that the share was worth fifteen
</p>
<p>thousand dollars. Booth kept his accounts latterly with great regularity,
</p>
<p>and was lavish as ever, but took note of all expenditures, however irregu-
</p>
<p>lar. He was one of those men whom the possession of money seems to
</p>
<p>have energized ; his life, so purposeless long before, grew by good fortune
</p>
<p>to a strict computation with the world. Yet what availed so sudden refor-
</p>
<p>mation, and of what use was the gaining of wealth, to throw one's life so soon
</p>
<p>away, and leap from competence to hunted infamy.
</p>
<p>The beauty of this mii and his easy confidentiality, not familiar, but
</p>
<p>marked by a mild and even dignity, made many women impassioned of
</p>
<p>him. He was licentious as men, and particularly as actors go, but not a se-
</p>
<p>ducer, so far as I can learn. I have traced one case in Philadelphia where
</p>
<p>a young girl who had seen him on the stage became enamored of him.
</p>
<p>She sent him bouquets, notes, photographs and all the accessories of an
</p>
<p>intrigue. Booth, to whom such things were common, yielded to the girl's
</p>
<p>importunities at last and gave her an interview. He was surprised to find
</p>
<p>that so bold a correspondent was so young, so fresh, and so beautiful. He
</p>
<p>told her therefore, in pity, the consequences of pursuing him; that he en-
</p>
<p>tertained no affection for her, though a sufficient desire, and that he was a
</p>
<p>man of the world to whom all women grew fulsome in their turn.
</p>
<p>" Go home," he said, " and beware of actors. They are to be seen, not
</p>
<p>to be known."
</p>
<p>The girl, yet more infatuated, persisted. Booth, who had no real vir-
</p>
<p>tue except by scintillations, became what he had promised, and one more
</p>
<p>soul went to the isles of Cyprus.
</p>
<p>In Montgomery, if I do not mistake. Booth met the woman from whom
</p>
<p>he received a stab which he carried all the rest of his days. She was an
</p>
<p>actress, and he visited her. They assumed a relation creditable only in La
</p>
<p>Boheme, and were as tender as love without esteem can ever be. But, after
</p>
<p>a time, Booth wearied of her and offered to say " good by." She re-
</p>
<p>fused  he treated her coldly ; she pleaded  he passed her by.
</p>
<p>Then, with a jealous woman's frenzy, she drew a knife upon him and
</p>
<p>stabbed him in the neck, with the intent to kill him. Being muscular, he

</p>
<p>quickly disarmed her, though he afterward suffered from the wound poign-
</p>
<p>antly.
</p>
<p>Does it not bring a blush to our faces that a good, great man, like he who
</p>
<p>has died  our President^should have met his fate from one so inured to
</p>
<p>a life of ribaldry ? Yet, only such an one could have been found to mur-
</p>
<p>der Abraham Lincoln.
</p>
<p>The women persecuted Booth more than he followed them. He was
</p>
<p>waylaid by married women in every provincial town or city where he
</p>
<p>played. His face was so youthful, yet so manly, and his movements so
</p>
<p>graceful and excellent, that other than the coarse and errant placed them-
</p>
<p>selves in his way. After his celebrated Boston engagement, women of all
</p>
<p>ages and degrees pressed in crowds before the Tremont House to see him
</p>
<p>depart. Their motives were various, but whether curiosity or worse, ex-
</p>
<p>hibiting plainly the deep influence which Booth had upon the sex. He
</p>
<p>could be anywhere easy and gentlemanly, and it is a matter of wonder that
</p>
<p>with the entry which he had to many well-stock*ed homes, he did not make
</p>
<p>hospitality mcjurn and friendship find in his visit shame and ruin. I have
</p>
<p>not space to go into the millionth catalogue of Booth's intrigues, even if
</p>
<p>this journal permitted further elucidation of so banned a subject. Most

<p>77ie Murderer.
</p>
<p>25
</p>
<p>of his adherents of this class were, like Heine's Polish virgins, and he was
</p>
<p>very popular with those dramatic ladies  few, I hope and know, in their
</p>
<p>profession  to whom divorce courts are superfluous. His last permanent
</p>
<p>acquaintance was one Ella Turner, of Richmond, who loved him with all
</p>
<p>the impetuosity of that love which does not think, and strove to die at the
</p>
<p>tidings of his crime and fight. Happy that even such a woman did not die
</p>
<p>associated with John Wilkes Booth. Such devotion to any other murder-
</p>
<p>er would have earned some poet's tear. But the daisies will not grow a
</p>
<p>whole rod from his grave.
</p>
<p>Of what avail, may we ask, on the impossible supposition that Booth's
</p>
<p>crime could have been considered heroic, was it that such a record should
</p>
<p>have dared to die for fame ? Victory would have been ashamed of its cham-
</p>
<p>pion, as England of Nelson, and Franc* of Mirabeau.
</p>
<p>I may add to this record that he had not been in Philadelphia a year,
</p>
<p>on first setting out in life, before getting inli a transaction of the kind spe-
</p>
<p>cified. For an alWur at his boarding-house he was compelled to pay a con-
</p>
<p>siderable sum of money, and it happily occurred just as he was to quit the
</p>
<p>city. He, had many quarrels and narrow escapes through his license, a
</p>
<p>husband in Syracuse, N. Y., ouce followed hiim all the way to Cleveland to
</p>
<p>avenge a domestic insult.
</p>
<p>Booth's paper " To Whom it ' may Concern" was not his only attempt
</p>
<p>at influential composition. He sometimes persuaded himself that he had
</p>
<p>literary ability ; but his orthography and pronunciation were worse than
</p>
<p>his syntax. The paper deposited with J. S. Clarke was useful as showing
</p>
<p>his power to entertain a deliberate purpose. It has one or two smart pas-
</p>
<p>sages in it  =as this :
</p>
<p>" Our once bright red stripes look like bloody gashes on the face of
</p>
<p>heaven."
</p>
<p>In the passages following there is common sense and lunacy :
</p>
<p>" I know how foolish 1 shall be deemed for undertaking such a step as
</p>
<p>this, where, on the one side, I have many friends and everything to make
</p>
<p>me happy, where my profession alone has gained me an income of more
</p>
<p>than, twenty thousand dollars a year, and where my great personal a7nbition

</p>
<p>in my profession has such a great field for labor. On the other hand, the
</p>
<p>South have ne^er bestowed upon me one kind word ; a place now where I
</p>
<p>have no friends, except beneath the sod ; a place where I must either be-
</p>
<p>come a private soldier or a beggar. To give up all of the former for the
</p>
<p>fe^^er, besides my mother and sisters, whom I love so dearly (although they
</p>
<p>80 widely diifer witli me in opinion) seems insane ; but God is my
</p>
<p>juda;e."
</p>
<p>Now, read the beginning of the manifesto, and see how prophetic were
</p>
<p>his words of his coming infimy. If he expected so much for capturing the
</p>
<p>President merely, what of our execration at slaying him ?
</p>
<p>" Right or wr(jng, God judge me, not man. For be my motive good or
</p>
<p>bad, of one thing 1 am sure, the lasting condemnation of the North.
</p>
<p>" I love peace more than life. Have loved the Union beyond expression.
</p>
<p>For four years have I waited, hoped and prayed for the dark clouds to
</p>
<p>break, and for a restoration of our former sunshine. To wait longer woula
</p>
<p>be a crime.. All hope for peace is dead. My prayers have proved as idle
</p>
<p>as my hopes. God's will be done. / go to see and share the bitter
</p>
<p>end:'
</p>
<p>To wait longer would be a crime. Oh ! what was the crime not to wait !
</p>
<p>Had he only shared the bitter end, then, in the common trench, his mt-m-
</p>
<p>26  The Life, Crime, and Capture of John Wilkes Booth.
</p>
<p>ory might have been hidden. The end had come when he appeared *,o make
</p>
<p>of beuigriuiit victory a quenchless revenge. One more selection I'rom his
</p>
<p>apostrophe will do. It suggests the manner of his death :
</p>
<p>" They say that the South has found that 'last ditch' which the North
</p>
<p>have so long derided. Should I reach her in safety, and find it true, I will "
</p>
<p>proudly beg permission to triumph or die in that same 'ditch' by her side."
</p>
<p>The swamp near which he died may be called, without unseemly pun  a
</p>
<p>truth, not a ban viot  the last ditch of the rebellion.
</p>
<p>None of the printed pictuz-es that I have seen do justice to Booth. Some
</p>
<p>of the cartes de visite get him very nearly. He had one of the finest vital
</p>
<p>heads I have ever seen. In fact, he was one of the l)est exponents of vital
</p>
<p>beauty I have ever met. By this I refer to physical beauty in the Medician
</p>
<p>sense  health, shapeliness, power ii* beautiful poise, and seemingly more
</p>
<p>powerful in repose than in energy. His hands and feet were s'zable, not
</p>
<p>small, and his legs were stoutlllnd muscular, but inclined to bow like his
</p>
<p>father's. From the waist up he was a perfect man ; his chest being full
</p>
<p>and broad, his shoulders gently sloping, and his arms as white as alabaster,
</p>
<p>but hard as marble. Over these, upon a neck which was its proper column,
</p>
<p>rose the cornice of a fine Ikjric face, spare at the jaws and nut anywhere
</p>
<p>over-ripe, but seamed with a nose of Roman model, the only relic of his
</p>
<p>half-Jewish parentage, which gave decision to the thoughtfully stern sweep
</p>
<p>of two direct, dark eyes, meaning to woman snare, and to man a search war^
</p>
<p>rant, while the lolly square forehead and square brows were crowned with
</p>
<p>a weight of curling jetty hair, like a rich Corinthian capital. His profile
</p>
<p>was eagleish, and afar his countenance was haughty. He seemed throat
</p>
<p>full of introspections, ambitious self-examinings, eye-strides into the future,
</p>
<p>as'if it withheld him something to which he had a right. I have since won-
</p>
<p>dered whether this moody demeanor did not come of a guilty spirit, but
</p>
<p>all the Booths look so. 
</p>
<p>Wilkes spoke to me in Washington for the first time three weeks before
</p>
<p>the murder. His address was winning as a girl's, rising in effect not from
</p>
<p>what he said, but from how he said it. It was magnetic, and I can des-
</p>
<p>cribe it therefore by its effects alone. I seemed, when he had spoken, to
</p>
<p>lean toward this man. His attitude spoke to me ; with as easy familiarity

</p>
<p>as I ever observed he drew near and conversed. The talk was on so
</p>
<p>trite things that it did not lie a second in the head, but whi-n 1 left him it
</p>
<p>was with the feeling that a most agreeable fellow had passed by.
</p>
<p>The next time the name of Wilkes Booth recurred to me was like the
</p>
<p>pistol shot he had fired. The right hand I had shaken murdered the father
</p>
<p>of the country.
</p>
<p>Booth was not graceful with his feet, although his ordinai-y walk was
</p>
<p>pleasant enough. But his arms were put to artistic uses ; not the baser
</p>
<p>ones like boxing, but all sorts of fencing, manual practice, and the hand-
</p>
<p>ling of weapons.
</p>
<p>In his dress, he was neat without being particular. Almost any clothes
</p>
<p>could fit him ; but he had nothing of the exquisite about him ; his neck-
</p>
<p>ties and all such matters were good without being gaudy. Nature had
</p>
<p>done much for him. In this beautiful palace an outlaw had builded his
</p>
<p>fire, and slept, and plotted, and dreamed.
</p>
<p>I have heard it said that Booth frequently cut his adversaries upon the
</p>
<p>%tage in shecir wantonness or bloodthirstiness. This is a mistake, and is
</p>
<p>attributable to his father, the elder Booth, who had the madiiess of con-
</p>
<p>founding hirhself with the character. Wilkes was too good a fencer to
</p>
<p>make ugly gashes ; his pride was his skill, not his awkwardness. Once
</p>
<p>The Murderer.
</p>
<p>ftr
</p>
<p>tie was playing with John McCulIoiigh in the last act of "Richard."
</p>
<p>They were fighting desperately. Suddenly the cross-piece on the hilt of
</p>
<p>McCulloiigh'ssw(jrd flew off" and cut the owner deeply in the forehead.
</p>
<p>Blood ran down McCullough's face, though they continued to struggle, and
</p>
<p>while, ostensibly, Booth was imitating a demon, he said in a half whisper :
</p>
<p>" Good God, John, did I hurt you ?"
</p>
<p>And when they went off the stage, Booth was white with fear that he had
</p>
<p>gashed his friend.
</p>
<p>As an actor, Buoth was too energetic to be correct ; his conception of
</p>
<p>Richard was vivid and original, one of the best that we have had, and he
</p>
<p>came nearer his father's rendering of the last act than any body we have
</p>
<p>had. His combat scene was terrific. The statement that his voice had
</p>
<p>failed has no valid foundation ; it was as good when he challenged the
</p>
<p>cavalry-men to combat as in the best of his Thespian successes. In all
</p>
<p>acting that required delicate characterization, refined conception or careful-
</p>
<p>ness, Booth was at sea. But in strong physical parts, requiring fair read-
</p>
<p>ing and an abundance of spring and tension, he was much finer than hearsay
</p>
<p>would have us believe.
</p>
<p>His Romeo was described a short time ago by the Washington Intelli-
</p>
<p>gencer as the most satisfactory of all renderings of that fine character. He
</p>
<p>played the Corsican Brothers three weeks on a run in Boston. He played
</p>
<p>Pescara at Ford's Theater  his last mock part in this world  on to-mor-
</p>
<p>row (Saturday) night, six weeks ago.
</p>
<p>He was fond of learning and reciting fugitive poems. His favorite piece
</p>
<p>was "The Beautiful Snow," comparing it to a lost purity. He has been
</p>
<p>known by gentlemen in this city to recite this poem with fine effect, and
</p>
<p>pry all the while. This was on the principle of " guilty people sitting at a
</p>
<p>play." His pocket-book was generally full of little selections picked up
</p>
<p>at random, and he had considerable delicacy of appreciation.
</p>
<p>On the morning of the murder, Booth breakfasted with Miss Carrie Bean,
</p>
<p>the daughter of a merchant, and a very respectable young lady, at the
</p>
<p>National Hall. He arose from the table at, say eleven o'clock. During
</p>
<p>the breakfast, those who watched him say that he was lively, piquant and

</p>
<p>self-possessed as ever in his life.
</p>
<p>That night the horrible crime thrilled the land. A period of crippled
</p>
<p>flight succeeded. Living in swamps, upon trembling hospitality, upon
</p>
<p>hopes which sank as he leaned upon them. Booth passed the nighcs in
</p>
<p>perilpus route or broken sleep, and in the end went down like a bravo,
</p>
<p>bu^in the eyes of all who read his history, commanding no respect for his
</p>
<p>valor, charity for his motive, or sympathy for his sin.

</p>
<p>THE ASSASSIN'S DEATH.
</p>
<p>Washington, April 28  8 p. m.
</p>
<p>A hard and "rizzly face overiooks me as I write. Its inconsiderable
</p>
<p>forehead is crowned with turning sandy hair, and the deep concave of its
</p>
<p>lon<^ insatiate jaws is almost hidden by a dense red beard, which can
</p>
<p>not'^stili abate the terrible decision of the large mouth, so well sustained
</p>
<p>by searchiiii( eyes of spotted gray, which roll and rivet one. This is the
</p>
<p>face of Lafayette Hakei- colonel and chief of the secret service, lie has
</p>
<p>played the most periious jxirts of the war, and is the capturer of the late
</p>
<p>President's murderer. I'he story that I am to tell you, as he and his
</p>
<p>trusty dependents told it to me, will be aptly commenced here, where the
</p>
<p>net was woven wnich took the dying life of Wilkes Booth.
</p>
<p>When the murder occured. Colonel Baker was absent from Washmg-
</p>
<p>ton. He returned on the third morning, and was at once besought by Sec-
</p>
<p>retary Stanton to j<jin the hue and cry against the escaped Booth. ^ The
</p>
<p>sairacious detective found that nearly ten thousand cavalry, and one-fourth
</p>
<p>as^nany policemen, had been meantime scom-ing, without plan or compass,
</p>
<p>the whole territory of Southern Maryland. They were treading on each
</p>
<p>other's heels, and mixing up the thing so confoundedly, that the best
</p>
<p>place for the culprits to have gone would have been in the very midst of
</p>
<p>their pursuers. Baker at once possessed himself of the little the War
</p>
<p>Department had learned, and started immediately to take the usual detec-
</p>
<p>tive measures, till then neglected, of offering a reward and getting out
</p>
<p>photographs of the suspected ones. He then dispatched a few chosen
</p>
<p>detectives to certain vital points, and awaited results.
</p>
<p>The first of these was the capture of Atzeroth. Others, like the taking
</p>
<p>of Dr. Mudge, simultaneously occured. But the district supected being
</p>
<p>remote froin'the railway routes, and broken by no telegraph station, the
</p>
<p>colonel, to place himself nearer the theater of events, ordered an opera-
</p>
<p>tor, with the necessary instrument, to tap the wire running to Point
</p>
<p>Lookout, near Chappells Point, and send him prompt messsages.
</p>
<p>The same steamer which took down the operator and two detectives
</p>
<p>brou<dit back one of the same detectives and a negro. This negro, taken

</p>
<p>to Colonel Baker's olKce, stated so positively that he had seen Booth and
</p>
<p>another man cross the Potomac in a fishing boat, while he was looking down
</p>
<p>upon them fi-om a bank, that the colonel was at first skeptical ; but Sifhen
</p>
<p>examined the negro answered so readily and intelligently, recognizing the
</p>
<p>men from the photographs, that Baker knew' at last that he had the true scent.
</p>
<p>Straightway he sent to General Hancock for twenty -five men, and while
</p>
<p>tne order was going, drew down his coast survey-maps. With that qui^k
</p>
<p>detective intuition amounting almost to inspiration. Fie cast upon the pro-
</p>
<p>bable route and destination of the refugees, as well as the point where he
</p>
<p>would soonest strike them. Booth, he knew, would not keep along the
</p>
<p>coast, with frequent deep rivers to cross, nor, indeed, in any direction
</p>
<p>east of Richmond, where he was liable at any time to cross our hues of
</p>
<p>occupation ; nor, being lame, could he ride on horseback, so as to place
</p>
<p>himself very far westward of his point of debarkation in Virg nia. But he
</p>
<p>would travel in a direct course from Bluff point, where he crossed to East-
</p>
<p>ern Tennessee, and this would take him through Port Royal on the Rap-
</p>
<p>pahannock river, in time to be intercepted there by the outgoing cavalry-
</p>
<p>men.
</p>
<p>The Assassin^s Death.
</p>
<p>29
</p>
<p>When, therefore, twenty-five men, under one Lieutenant Dougherty, ar-
</p>
<p>rived at his office door, Baker phiced the whole under control of his for-
</p>
<p>mer lieutenant-colonel, E. J. Conger, and of his cousin, Lieutenant L. B.
</p>
<p>Baker  the first of Ohio, the last of New-York  and bade them go with
</p>
<p>all dispatch to Belle Plain on the Lower P^otomac, there to disembark, and
</p>
<p>scour the country faithfully around Port Koyal, but not to return unless
</p>
<p>they captured their men.
</p>
<p>Conger is a short, decided, indomitable, courageous fellow, provincial in
</p>
<p>his manners, but fully understanding his business, and collected as a house-
</p>
<p>wife on Sunday. ,
</p>
<p>Young Baker is large and fine-looking  a soldier, but no policeman 
</p>
<p>and he deferred to Conger, very properly, during most of the events
</p>
<p>succeeding.
</p>
<p>Quitting Washington at 2 o'clock p. m. on Monday, the detectives and
</p>
<p>cavalrymen disembarked at Belle Plain, on the border of Stafford county,
</p>
<p>at 10 o'clock, in the darkness. Belle Plain is simply the nearest landing
</p>
<p>to Fredericksburg, seventy miles from Washington city, and located upon
</p>
<p>Potomac creek. It is a wharf and warehouse merely, and here the steamer
</p>
<p>John S. Ide stopped and made fast, while the party galloped off in the dark-
</p>
<p>ness. . Conger and Baker kept ahead, riding up to farm-houses and question-
</p>
<p>ing the inmates, pretending to be in search of the Maryland gentlemen be-
</p>
<p>longing to the party. But nobody had seen the parties described, and, after
</p>
<p>a futile ride on the Fredericksburg road, they turned shortly to the east,
</p>
<p>;iid kept up their baffled inquiries all the way to Port Coaway, on the Raj>-
</p>
<p>pahannock.
</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning they presented themselves at the Port Royal ferry,
</p>
<p>and inquired i>f the ferry-man, while he was taking them over in squads of
</p>
<p>seven at a time, if he had seen any two such men. Continuing their in
</p>
<p>quiries at Port Royal, they found one Rollins a fisherman, who referred
</p>
<p>them to a negro named Lucas, as having driven two men a short distance
</p>
<p>toward Bowling Green in a wagon. It was found that these men answered
</p>
<p>to the description. Booth having a crutch as previously ascertained.
</p>
<p>The day before Booth and Harold had applied at Port Conway for the

<p>general ferry-boat, hat the ferryman was then fishing and would not desist
</p>
<p>for the inconsiderable fare of only two persons, but to their supposed
</p>
<p>good fortune a lot of confederate cavalrymen just then came along, who
</p>
<p>threatened the ferryman with a shot in the head if he did not instantly
</p>
<p>bring across his craft and ti-ansport the entire party. These cavalrymen
</p>
<p>were of Moseby's disbanded command, returning from Fairfax Court
</p>
<p>House to their homes in Caroline county. Their captain was on his way
</p>
<p>to visit a sweetheart at Bowling Green, and he had so far taken Booth under
</p>
<p>his patronage, that when the latter was haggling with Lucas for a team, he
</p>
<p>offered both Booth and Harold the use of his horse, to ride and walk alter-
</p>
<p>nately.
</p>
<p>Li this way Lucas was providentially done out of the jbb, and Booth
</p>
<p>rode off' toward Bowling Green behind the confederate captain on one and
</p>
<p>the same horse. 
</p>
<p>So much learned, the detectives, with Rollins for a guide, dashed off in
</p>
<p>the bright daylight of Tuesday, moving southwestward thrinigh the level
</p>
<p>plains of Caroline, seldom stopping to ask questions, save at a certain half-
</p>
<p>way house, where a woman told them that the cavalry party of ye.sterday
</p>
<p>had returned minus one man. As this was far from circumstantial, the
</p>
<p>party rode along in the twilight, and reached Bowling Green at eleveu
</p>
<p>o'clock in the night.

</p>
<p>80
</p>
<p>The Life, Crime, and Capture of John Wilkes Booth.
</p>
<p>This is the court-house town of Caroline county  a small and scattered
</p>
<p>ulace, having within it an ancient tavern, no longer used inv other than
</p>
<p>lutl'Mii"- purposes ; but here they hauled from his bed the captain aforesaid,
</p>
<p>and l)ade him dress himself. As soon as he comprehended the matter he
</p>
<p>became pallid and eagerly narrated all the facts in his possession. Booth,
</p>
<p>to his knowledge, was then lying at the house of one Garrett, which they
</p>
<p>had passed, and Harold had departed the existing day with the intention of
</p>
<p>rejoining him.
</p>
<p>Talking this captain along for a guide, the worn out horsemen retraced,
</p>
<p>thorio-h some of the men were so haggard and wasted with travel that they
</p>
<p>had to be kicked into intelligence before they could climb to their saddles.
</p>
<p>The objects of the chase thus at hand, the detectives, full of sanguine pur-
</p>
<p>pose, hurried the cortege so well along that by 2 o'clock early morning, all
</p>
<p>halted at Garrett's gate. In the pale moonlight three hundred yards from
</p>
<p>the main road, to the left, a plain old farmhouse looked grayly through its
</p>
<p>environino' locusts. It was worn and whitewashed, aud two-storied, and its
</p>
<p>half-human windows glowered down upon the silent cavalrymen like watch-
</p>
<p>in<>- owls which stood as sentries over some horrible secret asleep within.
</p>
<p>The front of this house looked up the road toward the Rappahannock, but
</p>
<p>did not face it, and on that side a long Virginia porch protruded, where, in
</p>
<p>the summer, among the honeysuckles, the humming bird flew like a visible
</p>
<p>odor. Nearest the main road, against the pallid gable, a single-storied
</p>
<p>kitchen stood, and there were three other doors, one opening upon the porch,
</p>
<p>one in the kitchen gable, and one in the rear of the farmhouse.
</p>
<p>Dimly seen behind, an old barn, high and weather-beaten, faced the
</p>
<p>roadside gate, for the house itself lay to the left of its own lane ; and
</p>
<p>nestling beneath the barn, a few long corn-cribs lay with a cattle shed at
</p>
<p>hand. There was not a swell of the landscape anywhere in sight. A plain
</p>
<p>dead level contained all the tenements and structures. A worm fence
</p>
<p>stretched along the road broken by two battered gate posts, and between
</p>
<p>Plan of Garrett's House.

<p>the road &nJ the house, the lane was crossed by a second fence and gate.
</p>
<p>The farm-house lane, passing the house front, kept straight on to the barn,
</p>
<p>though a second c;irriage track ran up to the porch.
</p>
<p>It "was a homely and primitive scene enough, pastoral as any farm boy's
</p>
<p>birth-place, and had been the seat of many toils and endearments. Young
</p>
<p>wives had b^en brought to it, and around its hearth the earliest cries of
</p>
<p>infants, gladdening mothers' hearts,*had made the household jubilant till
</p>
<p>the stars catna out, and were its only sentries, save the bright lights at its
</p>
<p>window-panes as of a camp-fire, and the suppressed chorusses of the
</p>
<p>domestic bivouac within, where apple toasting and nut cracking and coun-
</p>
<p>try games shortened the winter shadows. Yet in this house, so peaceful by
</p>
<p>moonlight, murder had washed its spotted hands, and ministered to its
</p>
<p>satiated appetite. History  present in every nook in the broad young
</p>
<p>world  had stopped to make a landmark of Garrett's farm.
</p>
<p>In the dead stillness. Baker dismounted and forced the outer gate ;
</p>
<p>Conger kept close behind him, and the horsemen followed cautiously. They
</p>
<p>made no noise hx the soft clay, nor broke the all-foreboding silence any-
</p>
<p>where, till the second gate swung open gratingly, yet even then rtor hoarse
</p>
<p>nor shrill response came back, save distant croaking, as of frogs or owls,
</p>
<p>or the whizz of some passing night-hawk. So they surrounded the pleas-
</p>
<p>ant old homestead, each horseman, carbine in poise, adjusted under the
</p>
<p>grove of locusts, so as to inclose the dwelling with a circle of fire. After
</p>
<p>a pause. Baker rode to the kitchen door on the side, and dismounting, rap-
</p>
<p>ped and halloed lustily. An old man, in drawers and night-shirt, hastily
</p>
<p>undrew the bolts, and stood on the threshold, peering shiveringly into the
</p>
<p>darkness, ^
</p>
<p>Baker seized him by the throat at once, and held a pistol to his ear.
</p>
<p>"Who  who is it that calls me?" cried the old man, "Where are the
</p>
<p>men who stay with you V challenged Baker, " If you prevaricate you are
</p>
<p>a dead man !" The old fellow, who proved to be the head of the family,
</p>
<p>was so overawed and paralysed that he stammered, and shook, and said
</p>
<p>not a word, " Go light a candle," cried Baker, sternly, " and be quick
</p>
<p>about it," The trembling old man obeyed, and in a moment the imper-

</p>
<p>fect rays flared upon his whitening hairs and bluishly pallid face. Then
</p>
<p>the question was repeated, backed up by the glimmering pistol, " where
</p>
<p>are those men?' The old man held to the wall, and his knees smote each
</p>
<p>other, "They are
</p>
<p>gone.
</p>
<p>he said. " We hav'n't got them in the house.
</p>
<p>I assure you that they are gone." Here there w^ere sounds and whisptir-
</p>
<p>ings in the main building adjoining, and the lieutenant strode to the door.
</p>
<p>A ludicrous instant intervened, the old man's modesty outran his terror.
</p>
<p>** Don't go in there," he said, feebly; '-there are women undressed in
</p>
<p>there." " Damn the women," cried Baker ; " what if they are undressed 1
</p>
<p>We shall go in if they haven't a rag." Leaving the old man in mute
</p>
<p>astonishment. Baker bolted through the door, and stood in an assemblage
</p>
<p>: of bare arms and night robes. His loaded pistol disarmed modesty of its
</p>
<p>delicacy and substituted therefor a seasonable terror. Here he repeated
</p>
<p>his summons, and the half light of the candle gave to his face a more than
</p>
<p>bandit ferocity. They all denied knowledge of the strangers' whereabouts.
</p>
<p>In the interim Conger had also entered, and while the household and its
</p>
<p>invaders were thus in weird tableaux, a young man appeared, as if he had
</p>
<p>risen from the ground. The muzzles of everybody turned upon him in a
</p>
<p>second ; but, while he blanched, he did not lose loquacity. " Father," he
</p>
<p>said, " we had better tell the truth about the matter. Those men whom

<p>you seek, gentlemen, are in the barn, I know. They wont there t'^ sleep."
</p>
<p>Leavino- one soldier to guard the old man  and the soldier was very glad
</p>
<p>of the job, as it relieved him of personal hazard in the approaching combat
</p>
<p> all the rest, with cocked pistols at the young man's head, followed on to
</p>
<p>the barn. It lay a hundred yards from the house, the front barndoor
</p>
<p>facing the west gable, and was an old and spacious structure, with floors
</p>
<p>only a trifle above the ground level.
</p>
<p>The troops dismounted, were stationed at regular intervals around it,
</p>
<p>and ten yards distant at every point, four special guards placed to com-
</p>
<p>mand the door and all with weapons in supple preparation, while Baker
</p>
<p>and Conger went direct to the portal. It had a padlock upon it, and the
</p>
<p>key of this Baker secured at once. In the interval of silence that ensued,
</p>
<p>the rustling of planks and straw was heard inside, as of persons rising
</p>
<p>from sleep.
</p>
<p>At the same moment Baker hailed :
</p>
<p>" To the persons in this barn. I have a proposal to make ; we are about
</p>
<p>to send in to- you tlie son of the man in whose custody you are found.
</p>
<p>Either surrender to him your arms and then give yourselves up, or we'll set
</p>
<p>fir6*to the place. We mean to take you both, or to have a boiifire and a
</p>
<p>shooting match,"
</p>
<p>No answer eume to this of any kind. The lad, John M. Garrett, who
</p>
<p>\as in deadly fear, was here pushed through the door by a sudden opening
</p>
<p>of it, and iinmediately Lieutenant Baker locked the door on the outside.
</p>
<p>The boy was heard to state his appeal in under tone. Booth replied :
</p>
<p>" Damn you. Get out of here. You have betrayed me."
</p>
<p>At the same time he placed his band in his pocket as for a pistol. A
</p>
<p>remonstrance followed, but the boy slipped quickly over tbe reopened por-
</p>
<p>tal, repoiting that his errand had failed, and that he dared nut enter again.
</p>
<p>All this time the candle brought from the house to the barn was burning
</p>
<p>close beside the two detectives, rendering it easy for any one Avithin to
</p>
<p>have shot them dead. This observed, the light was cautiously removed,
</p>
<p>and everybody took care to keep out of its reflection. By this time the
</p>
<p>crisis of the position was at hand, the cavalry exhibited very variable in-
</p>
<p>clinations, some to run away, others to shoot Booth without a summons, but

</p>
<p>all excited and fitfully silent. At the house near by the female folks were
</p>
<p>seen collected in the doorway, and the necessities of the case provoked
</p>
<p>prompt conclusions. The boy was placed at a remote point, and the sum-
</p>
<p>mons repeattd by Baker :
</p>
<p>"You must surrender inside there. Give up your arms and appear.
</p>
<p>There is no chance for escape. We give you five mmutes to make up
</p>
<p>your mind."
</p>
<p>A bold, clarion reply came from within, so strong as to be heard at the
</p>
<p>house door :
</p>
<p>" Who are you, and what do you want with us f
</p>
<p>Baker again urged : " We want you to deliver up your arms and become
</p>
<p>our prisoners."
</p>
<p>"But who are you?" hallooed the same strong voice.
</p>
<p>Baker. " That makes no difference. We know who you are, and we
</p>
<p>want )ou. We have here fifty men, armed with carbines and pistols.
</p>
<p>You cannot escape.''
</p>
<p>There was a long pause, and then Booth said :
</p>
<p>" Captam. this is a hard case, I swear. Perhaps I am being taken by my
</p>
<p>own friends." No reply from the detectives.
</p>
<p>P)OOth  " Well, give us a little time to consider."

</p>
<p>\
</p>
<p>Baker  " Very well. Take time."
</p>
<p>Here ensued a long and eventful pause. What thronging memories it
</p>
<p>brought to Booth, we can only guess. In this little interval he made tha
</p>
<p>resolve to die. But he was cool and steady to the end. Baker, after a
</p>
<p>lapse, hailed for the last time.
</p>
<p>" Well, we have waited long enough ; surrender your arms and come
</p>
<p>out, or we'll fire the barn."
</p>
<p>Booth answered thus : " I am but a cripple, a one-legged man. With-
</p>
<p>draw your forces one hundred yard from the door, and J will come. Give
</p>
<p>me a cbmce for my life, captain. I will never be taken alive."
</p>
<p>Baker  " We did not come here to fight, but to capture you. I say
</p>
<p>again, appear, or the barn shall be fired."
</p>
<p>Then with a long breath, which could be heard outside. Booth cried in
</p>
<p>sudden calmness, still invisible, as were to him his enemies :
</p>
<p>" Well, then, my brave boys, prepare a stretcher for me."
</p>
<p>There was a pause repeated, broken by low discussions within between
</p>
<p>Booth and his associate, the former saying, as if in answer to some I'emon-
</p>
<p>strance or appeal, " Get away from me. You are a damned coward, and
</p>
<p>mean to leave me in my distress ; but go, go. I don't want you to stay.
</p>
<p>I Won't have you stay." Then he shouted aloud :
</p>
<p>"There's a man inside who wants to surrender."
</p>
<p>Baker  " Let him come, if he will bring his arms."
</p>
<p>Here Harold, rattling at the door, said : " Let me out ; open the door ;
</p>
<p>I want to surrender."
</p>
<p>Baker  " Hand out your arms, then."
</p>
<p>Harold  " 1 have not got any."
</p>
<p>Baker  " You are the man that carried the carbine yesterday ; bring It
</p>
<p>out." :
</p>
<p>Harold  " I haven't got any." /
</p>
<p>This was said in a whining tone, and with an almost visible shiver. /
</p>
<p>Booth cried aloud, at this hesitation : " He hasn't got any arms ; they are
</p>
<p>mine, and I have kept them."
</p>
<p>Baker  Well, he carried the carbine, and must bring it out."

<p>Booth  " On the word and honor of a gentleman, he has no arms with
</p>
<p>him. They are mine, and I have got them."
</p>
<p>At this time Harold was quite up to the door, within whispering dis-
</p>
<p>tance of Baker. The latter told him to put out his hands to be handcuffed,
</p>
<p>at the same time drawing open the door a little distance. Harold thrust
</p>
<p>forth his hands, when Baker, seizing him, jerked him into the night, and
</p>
<p>straightway delivered him over to a deputation of cavalrymen. The
</p>
<p>fellow began to talk of his innocence and plead so noisily that Conger
</p>
<p>threatened to gag him unless he ceased. Then Booth made his last appeal,
</p>
<p>in the same clear unbroken voice :
</p>
<p>" Captain, give me a chance. Draw off your men and I will fight them
</p>
<p>singly. I could have killed you six times to-night, but 1 believe you to be
</p>
<p>a brave man, and would not murder you. Give a lame man a show."
</p>
<p>It was too late for parley. All this time Booth's voice had sounded from
</p>
<p>the middle of the barn.
</p>
<p>Ere he ceiised speaking. Colonel Conger, slipping around to the rear,
</p>
<p>drew some loose straws through a crack, and lit a match upon them. They
</p>
<p>were dry and blazed up in an instant, carrying a sheet of smoke and flame
</p>
<p>through the parted planks, and heaving in a twinkling a world of light and
</p>
<p>heat upon the magazine within. The blaze lit up the black recesses of the
</p>
<p>great barn till every wasp's nest and cobweb in the roof was luminous,
</p>
<p>T^-f

<p>36 The Life, Crime and Capture of John Wilkes Booth.
</p>
<p>flinging stroaks of red and violet across the tumbled farm gear in the cor-
</p>
<p>tii'r, pU)Ws, harrows, hoes, rakes, sugar mills, and making every separate
</p>
<p>grain in the high bin adj;icent, gleam like a mote of precious gold. They
</p>
<p>tinged the beams, the upright columns, the barricades, where clover and
</p>
<p>timothy, piled high, held toward the hot incendiary their separate straws
</p>
<p>for the funeral pile. They bathed the murderer's retreat in beautiful illu-
</p>
<p>mination, and while in bold outline his figure stood revealed, they rose like
</p>
<p>an impenetrable wall to guard from sight the hated enemy who lit them.
</p>
<p>Behind the blaze, with his eye to a crack, Conger saw Wilkes Booth stand-
</p>
<p>ing upright upon a crutch. lie likens him at this instant to his brother
</p>
<p>Edwin, whom he says he so much resembled that he half believed, for the
</p>
<p>moment, the whole pursuit to have been a mistake. At the gleam of the
</p>
<p>fire Wilkes dropped his crutch, and, carbine in both hands, crept up to the
</p>
<p>spot to espy the incendiary and shoot him dead. His eyes were lustrous
</p>
<p>like fever, and swelled and rolled in terrible beauty, while his teeth were
</p>
<p>fixed, and he wore the expression of one in the calmness before frenzy. In vain
</p>
<p>he peered with vengeance in his look ; the blaze that made him visible con-
</p>
<p>cealed his enemy. A second he turned glaring at the fire, as if to leap
</p>
<p>upon it and extinguish it, but it had made such headway that this was a
</p>
<p>futile impulse and he dismissed it. As calmly as upon the battle field a
</p>
<p>veteran stands amidst the hail of ball and shell, and plunging iron, Booth
</p>
<p>turned at a man's stride, and pushed for the door, carbine in poise, and the
</p>
<p>last resolve of death, which we name despair, set on his high, bloodless
</p>
<p>forehead.
</p>
<p>As so he dashed, intent to expire not unaccompanied, a disobedient ser-
</p>
<p>geant at an eye-hole drew upon him the fatal bead. The barn was all
</p>
<p>glorious with conflagration and in the beautiful ruin this outlawed man
</p>
<p>strode like all that we know of wicked valor, stern in the fiice of death. A
</p>
<p>shock, a shout, a gathering up of his splendid figure as if to overtip the
</p>
<p>stature God gave him, and John Wilkes Booth fell headlong to the floor,
</p>
<p>lying there in a heap, a little life remaining.
</p>
<p>" He has shot himself!" cried Baker, unaware of the source of the report,
</p>
<p>and rushing in, he grasped his arms to guard against any feint or strategy.
</p>
<p>A moment convinced him that further struggle with the prone flesh was

<p>useless. Booth did not move, nor breathe, nor gasp. Conger and two ser-
</p>
<p>geants now entered, and taking up the body, they bore it in haste from the
</p>
<p>advancing flame, and laid it without upon the grass, all fresh with heavenly-
</p>
<p>dew.
</p>
<p>" Water," cried Conger, " bring water."
</p>
<p>When this was dashed into his face, he revived a moment and stirred his
</p>
<p>lips. Baker put his ear close down, and heard him say :
</p>
<p>" Tell mother  and die  for my country."
</p>
<p>They lifted him again, the fire encroaching in hotness upon them and
</p>
<p>placed him on the porch before the dwelling.
</p>
<p>A mattrass was brought down, on which they placed him and propped
</p>
<p>his head, and gave him water and brandy. The women of the household,
</p>
<p>joined meantime by another son, who had been found in one of the corn
</p>
<p>cribs, watching as he said, to see that Booth and Harold did not steal the
</p>
<p>horses, were nervous, but prompt to do the dying man all kindnesses,
</p>
<p>although waived sternly back by the detectives. They dipped a rag in
</p>
<p>bri.ndy and water, and this being put between Booth's teeth he sucked it
</p>
<p>grredily. When he was able to articulate again, he muttered to Mr. Baker
</p>
<p>the same words, with an addenda. " Tell mother I died for mv country,
</p>
<p>I thought 1 did for the best." Baker repeated this, sayiug at the same time
</p>
<p>The Assass'uCs Death. 37
</p>
<p>** Booth, do I repeat it correctly." Booth nodded his head. By this timo
</p>
<p>the grayness of dawn was approaching ; moving figures inquisitively com-
</p>
<p>ing near were to be seen distinctly, and the cocks began to crow gutturally,
</p>
<p>though the barn was a hulk of blaze and ashes, sendinaj toward the zenith
</p>
<p>a spiral line of dense smoke. The women became importunate that the
</p>
<p>troops might be ordered to extinguish the fire, which was spreading toward
</p>
<p>their precious corn-cribs. Not even death could banish the call of interest.
</p>
<p>Soldiers were sent to put out the fire, and Booth, relieved of the bustle
</p>
<p>around him, drew near to death apace. Twice he was heni-;l to say, " kill
</p>
<p>me, kill me." His lips often moved but could complete no appreciable
</p>
<p>sound. He made once a motion which the quick eye of Conger under-
</p>
<p>stood to mean that his throat pained him. Conger put his finger there,
</p>
<p>when the dying man attempted to cough, but only causi-d the blood at his
</p>
<p>perforated neck to flow more lively. He bled very little, although shot
</p>
<p>quite through, beneath and behind the ears, his collar being severed on both
</p>
<p>sides.
</p>
<p>A soldier had been meanwhile despatched for a doctor, but the route and
</p>
<p>return were quite six miles, and the sinner was sinking fast. Still the
</p>
<p>women made etforts to get to see him, but were always rebutfed, and all
</p>
<p>the brandy they could find was demanded by the assassin, who motioned
</p>
<p>for strong drink every two minutes. He made frequent desires to be turn-
</p>
<p>ed over, not by speech, but by gesture, and was alternately placed upon his
</p>
<p>back, belly and side. His tremendous vitality evidenced itself almost
</p>
<p>miraculously. Now and then his heart would cease to throb, and his pulses
</p>
<p>would be as cold as a dead man's. Directly life would begin anew, the
</p>
<p>face would flush up efl'ulgently, the eyes open and brighten, and soon re-
</p>
<p>lapsing, stillness re-asserted, would again be dispossessed by the same mag-
</p>
<p>nificent triumph of man over mortality. Finally the fussy little doctor
</p>
<p>arrived, in time to be useless. He probed the wound to see if the ball
</p>
<p>were not in it, and shook his head sagely and talked learnedly.
</p>
<p>Just at his coming Booth had asked to have his hands raised and shown
</p>
<p>him. They were so paralyzed that he did not know their location. When
</p>
<p>they were displayed he muttered, with a sad lethargy, ''Useless, useless."
</p>
<p>These were the last words he ever uttered. As he began to die the sun

<p>rose and threw beams into all the tree-tops. It w;i.s of a man's height when
</p>
<p>the struggle of death twitched and fingered in the fading bravo's face. Hia
</p>
<p>jaw drew spasmodically and obliquely downward ; his eyeballs rolled to-
</p>
<p>ward his feet, and began to swell ; lividness, like a horrible shadow, fast-
</p>
<p>ened upon him, aud, with a sort of gurgle and sudden check, he stretched
</p>
<p>his feet and threw his head back and gave up the ghost.
</p>
<p>They sewed him up in a saddle blanket. This was his shroud ; too like
</p>
<p>a soldier's. Harold, meantime, had been tied to a tree, but was now re-
</p>
<p>leased for the march. Colonel Conger pushed on immediately for Wash-
</p>
<p>ington ; the cortege was to follow. Bcjoth's only arms were his carbine,
</p>
<p>knife, and two revolvers. They found about him bills of exchange, Canada
</p>
<p>money, and a diary. A venerable old negro living in th^ vicinity had the
</p>
<p>misfortune to possess a hoi'se. This horse was a relic of former genera-
</p>
<p>tions, and showed by his protruding ribs the general leanness of the land.
</p>
<p>He moved in an eccentric amble, and when put upon his speed was genet
</p>
<p>ally run backward. To this old negro's horse was harnessid a very shaky
</p>
<p>and absurd wagon, which rattled like approaching dissolution, and each park
</p>
<p>of it ran without any connection or correspondence with any other part. It
</p>
<p>had no tail-board, and its shafts were sharp as famine ; and into this mimicry
</p>
<p>of a vehicle the murdex'er was to be seat to the I'otomac river, while tke
</p>
<p>^  
</p>
<p>88 Hie Life, Crime, and Cajiture of John Wilkes Booth.
</p>
<p>man he had murdered was moving in state across the mourning continent.
</p>
<p>The old negro geared up his wagon by means of a set of fossil harness, and
</p>
<p>when it was backed to Garrett's porch, they laid within it the discolored
</p>
<p>corpse. The corpse was tied with ropes around the legs and made fast to
</p>
<p>the wagon sides. Harold's legs were tied to stirrups, and he was placed in
</p>
<p>the centre of four murderous looking cavalrymen. The two sons of Gar-
</p>
<p>rett were also taken along, despite the sobs and petitions of the old folks and
</p>
<p>women, but the rebel captain who had given Booth a lift, got oft amidst the
</p>
<p>night's agitations, and was not rearrested. So moved the cavalcade of re-
</p>
<p>tribution, with death in its midst, along the road to Port Royal. When
</p>
<p>the wagon started. Booth's wound till now scarcely dribbling, began to run
</p>
<p>anew. It fell through the crack of the wagon, dripping upon the axle, and
</p>
<p>spotting the road with terrible wafers. It stained the planks, and soaked
</p>
<p>the blankets; and the old negro, at a stoppage, dabbled his hands in it by
</p>
<p>mistake ; he drew back instantly, with a shudder and stifled expletive,
</p>
<p>" Gor-r-r, dat '11 never come off" in de world ; it's murderer's blood." He
</p>
<p>wrung his hands, and looked imploringly at the officers, and shuddered
</p>
<p>again : " Gor-r-r, I wouldn't have dat on me fur tousand, tousand dollars."
</p>
<p>The progress of the team was slow, with frequent danger of shipwreck
</p>
<p>altogether, but toward noon the cortege filed through Port Royal, where
</p>
<p>the citizens came out to ask the matter, and why a man's body, covered
</p>
<p>with sombre blankets, was going by with so great escort. They were told
</p>
<p>that it was a wounded confederate, and so held their tongues. The little
</p>
<p>ferry, again in requisition, took them over by squads, and they pushed from
</p>
<p>Port Conway to Bell Plain, which they reached in the middle of the after
</p>
<p>noon. All the way the blood dribbled from the corpse in a slow, incessant,
</p>
<p>sanguine exudation. The old negro was niggardly dismissed with two
</p>
<p>paper dollars. The dead man untied and cast upon the vessel's deck, steam
</p>

</p>
<p>wont, beyond the East Branch, and returning, found Booth wounded, who
</p>
<p>begged him to be his companion. Of his crime he knew nothing, so help

<p>courage, and retribution centered in the dead flesh at his feet. At Wash-

<p>It is gone. I will not tell you where. The only man who knows is sworn

<p>to silence. Never till the great trumpeter comes shall the grave of

<p>Booth be discovered." And this is true. Last night, the 27th of April, a

<p>Washikgton, May 2.
</p>
<p>Justice and fame are equally and simultaneously satisfied. The Presi-
</p>
<p>dent is not yet in his sarcophagus, but all the conspirators against his life,
</p>
<p>with a minor exception or two, are in their prison cells waiting for the
</p>
<p>halter.
</p>
<p>The dark and bloody plot against a good ruler's life is now so fully un-
</p>
<p>raveled that I may make it plain to you. There is nothing to be gained
</p>
<p>by further waiting ; the trials are proceeding ; the evidence is mountain
</p>
<p>high. Within a week the national scaffold will have done its work, and
</p>
<p>be laid away forever. This prompt and necessary justice will signal the
</p>
<p>last public assassination in America. Borgia, and Medici, and Brinvilliers,

<p>have left no descendants on this side of the world.

<p>multitude. One man was its head and heart ; its accessories were so m>
</p>
<p>merous that the trouble is not whom to suspect, but whom not accuse.
</p>
<p>Damning as the result must be to the character of our race, it must be
</p>
<p>admitted, in the light of facts, that Americans are as secretive and as
</p>
<p>skillful plotters as any people in the world. The Rye House plot, neve/
</p>
<p>fully understood ; the many schemes of Mazzini, never fiistened upon him
</p>
<p>sufficiently well for implication, yield in extent, darkness and intricacy, to
</p>
<p>the republican plot against the President's life and those of his counselors.

<p>The police operations prove that the late murder (^ as not a spasmodic
</p>
<p>and fitful crime, but long premeditated, and carried to consummation with

<p>as much cohesion and resolution as the murder of Allcssandro de Medici

<p>40 The Life, Crime, and Capture of John Wilkes Booth.
</p>
<p>the atm<sphere of common felons  I still, at every new developement,
</p>
<p>stand t'arther back in surprise and terror at the wonderful resources and
</p>
<p>extraordinary influence of one whom 1 had learned to consider a mere
</p>
<p>Thespian, full of sound, fury, and assertion.
</p>
<p>Strange and anomalous as the facts may seem, John Wilkes Booth
</p>
<p>was the sole projector of the plot against the President which culminated
</p>
<p>in the taking of that good man's life. He had rolled under his tongue
</p>
<p>the sweet paragraphs of Shakspearerefering to Brutus, as had his father so
</p>
<p>well, that the old man named one son Junius Brutus, and the other John
</p>
<p>Wilkes, after the wild English agitator, until it became his ambition, like
</p>
<p>the wicked Lorenzino de Mi-dici, to stake his life upon one stroke for fame,
</p>
<p>the murder of a ruler obnoxious to the South.
</p>
<p>That Wilkes Booth was a southern man from the first may be accounted
</p>
<p>for upon grounds of interest as well as of sympathy. It is insidious to find
</p>
<p>no higher incentive than appreciation, but on the stage this is the first and
</p>
<p>last motive ; and as Edwin Booth made his success in the North and re-
</p>
<p>mained steadfast, Wilkes Booth was most truly applauded in the South,
</p>
<p>and became rebel. A false emotion of gratitude, as well as an impulse
</p>
<p>of mingled waywardness and gratitude, set John Wilkes's face from the
</p>
<p>first toward the North, and he burned to make his name a part
</p>
<p>of history, cried into fame by the applauses of the South.
</p>
<p>He hung to his bloody suggestion with dogged inflexibility, maintaining
</p>
<p>only one axiom above all the rest  that whatever minor parts might be en-
</p>
<p>acted  Casca, Cassius, or what not  he was to be the dramatic Brutus, ex-
</p>
<p>cepting that assassin's negativeness. In other words, the idea was to be his
</p>
<p>own, as well as the crowning blow.
</p>
<p>Booth shrank at first from murder, until another and less dangerous res-
</p>
<p>olution failed. This was no less than the capture of the President's body,
</p>
<p>and its detention or transportation to the South. I do not rely on this as-
</p>
<p>sertion upon his sealed letter, where he avows it; there has been found upon
</p>
<p>a street within the city limits, a house belonging to one Mrs. Greene, mined
</p>
<p>and furnished with underground apartments, manacles and all the accessor-
</p>
<p>ies to private imprisonment. Here the President, and as many as could
</p>
<p>be gagged and conveyed away with him, were to be concealed in the event

</p>
<p>of tailure to run them into the confederacy. Owing to his failure to group
</p>
<p>around him as many men as he desired. Booth abandoned the project of
</p>
<p>kidnapping ; but the house was discovered last week, as represented, ready
</p>
<p>to be blown up at a moment's notice.
</p>
<p>It was at this time that Booth devised his triumphant route through the
</p>
<p>South. The dramatic element seems to have been never lacking in his
</p>
<p>design, and with all his base purposes he never failed to consider some sub-
</p>
<p>8e<:(uent notoriety to be enjoyed. He therefore shipped, before the end of
</p>
<p>1864, his theatrical wardrobe from Canada to Nassau. After the commis-
</p>
<p>sion of his crime he intended to reclaim it, and " star" through the South,
</p>
<p>drawing money as much by his crime as his abilities.
</p>
<p>When Booth began "on his own responsibility," to hunt for accomplices,
</p>
<p>he found his theory at fault. The bold men he had dreamed of refused to
</p>
<p>join him in the rash attempt at kidnapping the President, and were too
</p>
<p>conscientious to meditate murder. All those who presented themselves
</p>
<p>were military men, unwilling to be subordinate to a civilian, and a merp
</p>
<p>play-actor, and the mortified bravo found himself therefore compelled to
</p>
<p>sink to a petty rank in the plot, or to make use of base and despicable
</p>
<p>{Assistants. His vanity found it easier to compound with the second alter
</p>
<p>native than the first.
</p>
<p>A Solution of the Conspiracy. 'il
</p>
<p>Here began the first resolve, which, in its mere animal estate, we may
</p>
<p>name courage. Booth found that a tragedy in real life could no more bo
</p>
<p>enacted without greasy-faced and knock-ivneed supernumeraries than upon
</p>
<p>the mimic stage. Your " First Citizen," who swings a stave for Marc
</p>
<p>Antony, and drinks hard porter behind the flies is very like tlie bravo of
</p>
<p>real life, who murders between his cocktails at the nearest bar. Wilkea
</p>
<p>Booth had passed the ordeal of a garlicky green-room, and did not shrink
</p>
<p>from the broader and ranker green-room of real life. lie assembled
</p>
<p>around him, one by one, the cut-throats at whom his soul would have re-
</p>
<p>volted, except that he had bec(me, by resolve, a cut-throat in himself.
</p>
<p>About this time certain gentlemen in Canada began to be uneuviably
</p>
<p>known. I abstain from giving their names, because unaware of how far
</p>
<p>they seconded this crime, if at all. But they seconded as infamous things,
</p>
<p>such as cowardly raids from neutral territory into the states, bauk robbings,
</p>
<p>lake pirating, city burning, counterfeiting, railway sundering, and the im-
</p>
<p>portation of yellow fever into peaceful and unoffending communities. I
</p>
<p>make no charges against those whom I do not know, but simply say that
</p>
<p>the confederate agents, Jacob Tompson, Larry McDonald, Clement Clay,
</p>
<p>and some others, had already accomplished enough villainy to make Wilkes
</p>
<p>Bat)th, on the first of the present year, believe that he had but to seek an
</p>
<p>interview with them.
</p>
<p>He visited the provinces once certainly, and three times it is believed,
</p>
<p>stopping in Montreal at St. Lawrence Hall, and banking four hundred and
</p>
<p>fifty-five dollars odd at the Ontario bank. This was his own money. I
</p>
<p>have myself seen his bank-book with the single entry of this amount. It
</p>
<p>was found in the room of Atzerott, at Kirkwood's Hotel, From this visit,
</p>
<p>whatever encouragement Booth received, he continued in systematic cor-
</p>
<p>respondence with one or more of those agents down to the commission of
</p>
<p>his crime. I dare not say how far each of these agents was implicated,
</p>
<p>My personal conviction is that they were neither loth to the miirder nor
</p>
<p>astonished when it had been done. They had money with discretion from
</p>
<p>the confederacy, though acting at discretion and outside of responsibility,
</p>
<p>and always, at every wild adventure, they instructed their dupes that each
</p>
<p>man took his life in his hand on every incursion into the north. So Beale

<p>took his, raiding on the great lakes. So Kennedy took his, on a midnight
</p>
<p>bonfire-tramp into the metropolis. So took the St. Albans raiders their
</p>
<p>lives in their palms, dashing into a peaceful town. And if these agents
</p>
<p>entertained Wilkes Booth's suggestion at all they plainly told him that he
</p>
<p>carried his life in his dagger's edge, and could expect from them neither
</p>
<p>aid nor exculpation.
</p>
<p>Some one or all of these agents furnished Booth with a murderer. Tlie
</p>
<p>fellow Wood or Payne, who stabbed Mr. Seward and was caught at Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt's house in Washington. He was one of three Kentucky brothers,
</p>
<p>all outlaws, and had himself, it is believed, accompanied one of his brothers,
</p>
<p>who is known to have been at St. Albans on the day of the bank-delivery.
</p>
<p>This Payne, besides being positively identified as the assassin of the
</p>
<p>Sewards, hiul no friends nor haunts in Washington. He was simply a dis-
</p>
<p>patched murderer, and after the night of the crime, struck northward of
</p>
<p>the frontier, instead of southward in the company of Booth. The proof,
</p>
<p>of this will follow in the course of the article.
</p>
<p>While 1 assert that the Canadian agents knew Booth and patted his back
</p>
<p>calling him, like AIncbeth, the " prince of cutthroats," I am equally cer.
</p>
<p>tain that Booth's project was unknown in Richmond. No word, nor writ-
</p>
<p>ten line, no clue of any sort has been found attaching Booth to thti coufeder
</p>
<p>L.
</p>
<p>42 The Life, Crime, and Capture of John Wilkes Booth.
</p>
<p>ate authorities. The most that can be urged to meet preposterous claims
</p>
<p>of this sort is, that out of the rebellion grew the murder; which is like
</p>
<p>attributing the measles to the creation of man. But McDonald and his
</p>
<p>party had money at discretion, and under their control the vilest fellows
</p>
<p>on the continent. Their personal influence over those errant ones amount-
</p>
<p>ed to omnipotence. Most of the latter were young and sanguine people,
</p>
<p>like Beale and Booth; their plots were made up at St. Catharine's, Toronto,
</p>
<p>and Montreal, and they have maintained since the war began, rebel mail
</p>
<p>routes between Canada and Richmond, leading directly passed Washington,
</p>
<p>If Booth received no positive instructions, he was at any rate adjudged
</p>
<p>a man likely to be of use, and therefore introduced to the rebel agencies
</p>
<p>in and around Washington. Doubtless by direct letter, or verbal instruo
</p>
<p>tion, he received a password to the house of Mrs. Surratt.
</p>
<p>Half applauded, half rebuffed by the rebel agents in Canada, Booth's
</p>
<p>impressions of his visit were just those which would whet him soonest for
</p>
<p>the tragedy. His vanity had been fed by the assurance that success d^
</p>
<p>pended upon himself alone, and th&t as he had the responsibility he would
</p>
<p>absorb the fame ; and the method of correspondence was of that dark and
</p>
<p>mysterious shape which powerfully operated upon his dramatic tempera-
</p>
<p>ment.
</p>
<p>What could please an actor, and the son of an actor, better than to mii>-
</p>
<p>gle as a principal in a real conspiracy, the aims of which were pseudo-
</p>
<p>patriotic, and the end so astounding that at its coming the whole globe
</p>
<p>would reel. Booth reasoned that the ancient world would not feel more
</p>
<p>sensitively the death of Julius Ccesar than the new the sudden taking off
</p>
<p>of Abraham Lincoln.
</p>
<p>And so he grew into the idea of murder. It became his business thought.
</p>
<p>It was his recreation and his study. He had not worked half so hard for
</p>
<p>histrionic success as for his terrible graduation into an assassin. He had
</p>
<p>fought often on the boards, and seen men die in well-imitated horror, with
</p>
<p>flowing blood upon his keen sword's edge, and the strong stride of mimio
</p>
<p>victory with which he flourished his weapon at the closing of the curtain-
</p>
<p>He embraced conspiracy like an old diplomatist, and found in the woman
</p>
<p>and the spot subjects for emulation.

<p>Southeast of Washington stretches a tapering peninsula, composed of
</p>
<p>four fertile counties, which at the remote tip make Point Lookout, and do
</p>
<p>not contain any town within them of more than a few hundred inhabitants.
</p>
<p>Tobacco has ruined the land of these, and slavery has ruined the people.
</p>
<p>Yet in t^e beginning they were of that splendid stock of Calvert and Lord
</p>
<p>Baltimore, but retain to-day only the religioij of the peaceful founder. I
</p>
<p>mention it is an exceptional and remarkable fact, that every conspirator in
</p>
<p>custody is by education a Catholic. These are our most loyal citizens else-
</p>
<p>where, but the western shore of Maryland is a noxious and pestilential place
</p>
<p>/or patriotism. The county immediately outside of the District of Columbia,
</p>
<p>to the south, is named Prince Gorgia's arid the pleasantest village of this
</p>
<p>county, close to Washington, is called Surrattsville. This consists of a
</p>
<p>few cabins at a cross-road, surrounding a fine old hotel, the master whereof^
</p>
<p>giving the settlement his name, left the property to his wife, who for a long
</p>
<p>time carried it on with indifferent success. Having a son and several
</p>
<p>daughters, she moved to Washington soon after the beginning of the war
</p>
<p>and let the tavern to a trusty friend  one John Lloyd. Surrattsville has
</p>
<p>gained nothing in patronage or business from the war, except that it became
</p>
<p>at an early date, a rebel postoffice. The great secret mail from Matthias
</p>
<p>Creek, Virginia, to Port Tobacco, struck Surrattsville, and thence headed
</p>
<p>A Solution of the 2ilystery. 43
</p>
<p>off to the cast to Washingt-on, going meanderingly north. Of this postr
</p>
<p>route Mrs. Surratt was a manageress ; and John Lloyd, when he rented
</p>
<p>her hotel, assumed the responsibility of looking out for the mail, as w^ll
</p>
<p>the duty of making Mrs. Surratt at home when she chose to visit him.
</p>
<p>So Siirrattsville only ten miles from Washington, has been throughout
</p>
<p>the war a sect of conspiracy. It was like a suburb of Richmond, reaching
</p>
<p>quite up to the rival capital ; and though the few Unionists on the peninsula
</p>
<p>knew its reputation well enough, nothing of the sort came out until the
</p>
<p>murder.
</p>
<p>Treason never found a better agent than Mrs. Surratt. She is a large,
</p>
<p>masculine, self-possessed female, mistress of her house, and as lithe a rebel
</p>
<p>as Belle Boyd or Mrs. Greenhough. She has not the flippantry and menace
</p>
<p>of the first, nor the social power of the second ; but the rebellion has found
</p>
<p>no fitter agent.
</p>
<p>At her country tavern and Washington home Booth was made welcome,
</p>
<p>and there began the muttered murder against the nation and mankind.
</p>
<p>The acquaintance of Mrs. Surratt in Lower Maryland undoubtedly sug-
</p>
<p>gested to Booth the route of escape, and made him known to his subse-
</p>
<p>quent accomplices. Last fall he visited the entire region, as far as
</p>
<p>Leonardstown, in St. Mary's county, professing to be in search of land but
</p>
<p>really hunting up confederates upon whom he could depend. At this time
</p>
<p>he bought a map, a fellow to which I have seen among Atzerott's effects,
</p>
<p>published at Buffalo for the rebel government, and marking at hap-hazard
</p>
<p>all the MaTvland villages, but without tracing the highroads at all. The
</p>
<p>absence of these roads, it w^ill be seen hereafter, very nearly misled Booth
</p>
<p>during his crippled flight.
</p>
<p>It could not but have struck Booth that this isolated part of Maryland
</p>
<p>ignorant and rebel to the brim, without telegraph or railways, or direct
</p>
<p>stage routes, belted with swamps and broken by dense timber, afforded
</p>
<p>extraordinary opportunities for shelter and escape. Only the coast survey
</p>
<p>had any adequate map of it ; it was ultima thiile to all intents, and treason
</p>
<p>might subsist in welcome upon it for a thousand years.
</p>
<p>When Booth cast around him for assistance, he naturally selected those
</p>
<p>men whom he could control. The first that recommended himself was one

</p>
<p>was a gunner, and therefore versed in arms ; he had traversed the whole

</p>
<p>Leonardsville, and he was respectably enough connected, so as to make his
</p>
<p>association creditable as well as useful.

<p>Harold, whose picture I have seen, is a dull-faced, shallow boy, smooth-
</p>
<p>haired, and provincial ; he had no money nor employment, except that he
</p>
<p>clerked for a druggist a while, until he knew Wilkes Booth, who looked at
</p>
<p>him only once, and bought his soul for a smile. Harold was infatuated by
</p>
<p>Booth as a woman by a soldier. He copied his gait and tone, adopted his
</p>
<p>opinions, and was unhappy out of his society. Booth gave him money,
</p>
<p>mysteriously obtained, and together they made the acquaintance of young
</p>
<p>John Surratt, son of the conspiratress.
</p>
<p>Young Surratt does not appear to have been a puissant spirit in the
</p>
<p>scheme ; indeed, all design and influence therein was absorbed by Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt and Booth. The latter was the head and heart of the plot ; Mrs.

<p>and that the North was a race of fratricides. Much was said of Brutus,
</p>
<p>and Booth repeated heroic passages to the delight of Harold, who learned
</p>
<p>them also, and wondered if he was not born to greatness.
</p>
<p>In this growing darkness, where all rehearsed cold-hearted murder,
</p>
<p>Wilkes Booth grew great of stature. He had found a purpose consonant
</p>
<p>with his evil nature and bad influence over weak men ; so he grew moodier,
</p>
<p>more vigilant, more plausible. By mien and temperament he was born to
</p>
<p>handle a stiletto. We have no face so markedly Italian ; it would stand
</p>
<p>for Caesar Borgia any day in the year. All the rest were swayed or per-
</p>
<p>suaded by Booth ; his schemes were three in order :
</p>
<p>1st. To kidnap the President and Cabinet, and run them South or blow
</p>
<p>tliem up.
</p>
<p>2d. Kidnapping failed, to murder the President and the rest and seek
</p>
<p>shelter in the confederate capital.
</p>
<p>3d. The rebellion failed, to be its avenger, and throw the country into
</p>
<p>consternation, while he escaped by the unfrequented parts of Maryland.
</p>
<p>When this last resolution had been made, the plot was both contracted
</p>
<p>nd extended. There were made two distinct circles of confidants  those
</p>
<p>aware of the meditated murder, and those who might shrink from murder,
</p>
<p>though willing accessories for a lesser object. Two colleagues for blood
</p>
<p>were at once accepted  Payne and Atzerott.
</p>
<p>The former I have sketched ; he is believed to have visited Washington
</p>
<p>once before, at Booth's citation ; for the murder was at first fixed for the
</p>
<p>day of inauguration. Atzerott was a fellow of German descent, who had
</p>
<p>led a desperate life at Port Tobacco, where he was a house-painter. He
</p>
<p>had been a blockade-runner across the Potomac, and a mail-carrier.

<p>When Booth and Mrs. Surratt broke the design to him, with a suggestion
</p>
<p>that there was wealth in it, he embraced the offer at once, and bought a
</p>
<p>dii"k and pistol. Payne also came from the North to W ashingt(jn, and,
</p>
<p>as fate would have it, the President was announced to appear at Ford's
</p>
<p>theater in public. There the resolve of blood was reduced to a definite
</p>
<p>moment.
</p>
<p>On the night before the crime Booth found on whom he could rely.
</p>
<p>John Surratt Wiis sent northward by his mother on Thursday. Sam
</p>
<p>Arnold and McLaughlin, each of whom was to kill a cabinet officer, grew
</p>
<p>pigeon-livered and ran away. Harold true to his partiality, lingered
</p>
<p>around Booth to the end ; Atzerott went so f;ir as to take his knife and
</p>
<p>pistol to Kirkwood's, where President Johnson was stopping, and hid them
</p>
<p>under the bed. But- either his counige failed, or a trifling accident de-
</p>
<p>ranged his plan. But Payne, a professional murderer, stood "game," and
</p>
<p>fought his way over prostrate figures to his sick victim's bed. There was
</p>
<p>great confusion and terror among the tacit and rash conspirators on Thurs-
</p>
<p>day night. They hiid looked upon the plot as of a melodrama, and found
</p>
<p>to their horror that John W^ilkes Booth meant to do murder.
</p>
<p>Six weeks before the murder, young John Surratt had taken two splen-
</p>
<p>did T^peating carbines to Surrattville and told John Lloyd to secret them.

</p>

</p>
<p>Tiio latter made a hole in the waiuscotting and suspended them fioui
</p>
<p>stiin<.'-s, so that they fell within the plastered wall of the room below. On
</p>
<p>the \Ki\-s afternoon of the murder, Mrs. Surratt was driven to Surrattsville,
</p>
<p>and she told John Lloyd to have the carbines ready because they would
</p>
<p>be called for that night. Harold was made quartermaster, and hired the
</p>
<p>horses. He and Atzerott were mounted between 8 o'clock and the time
</p>
<p>of the murder, and riding about the streets together.
</p>
<p>The whole party was prepared for a long ride, as their spurs and gaunt-
</p>
<p>lets show. It may have been their design to ride in company to the Lower
</p>
<p>Potomac, and by their numbers exact subsistence and transportation ; but
</p>
<p>all edifices of murder lack a corner stone. We only know that Booth ate
</p>
<p>and talked well during the day ; that he never seemed so deeply involved
</p>
<p>in ' oil," and that there is a hiatus between his supper here and his appear-
</p>
<p>ance at Ford's theater.
</p>
<p>Lk)yd, I may interpolate, ordered his wife a few days before the rnurder
</p>
<p>to go on a visit to Allen's Fresh. She says she does not know why she
</p>
<p>was so sent away, but swears that it is so. Harold, three weeks before the
</p>
<p>murder, visited Port Tobacco, and said that the next time the boys heard
</p>
<p>of him he would be in Spain ; he added that with Spain there was no extra-
</p>
<p>dition treaty. He said at Surrattsville that he meant to make a barrel of
</p>
<p>money, or his neck would stretch.
</p>
<p>Atzerott said that if he ever came to Port Tobacco again he would be
</p>
<p>rich enough to buy the whole place.
</p>
<p>Wilkes Booth told a friend to go to Ford's on Friday night and see the
</p>
<p>best acting in the world.
</p>
<p>At Ford's theater, on Friday night, there were many standers in the
</p>
<p>neighborhood of the do-^r, and along the dress circle in the direction of the
</p>
<p>private box where the President sat.
</p>
<p>The play went on pleasantly, though Mr. Wijkes Booth an observer of
</p>
<p>the audience, visited the stage and took note of the positions. His alleged
</p>
<p>associate, the stage carpenter, then received quiet orders to clear the pas-
</p>
<p>sage by the wings from the prompter's post to the stage door. All this
</p>
<p>time, Mr. Lincoln, in his family circle, unconscious of the death that crowd-
</p>
<p>ed fast upon him, watched the pleasantry and smiled and felt heartful of

</p>
<p>gentleness.
</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a murmur near the audience door, as of a man
</p>
<p>speaking above his bound. He said :
</p>
<p>" Nine o'clock and forty -five minutes !"
</p>
<p>These words were reiterated fnjm mouth to mouth until they passed the
</p>
<p>theater door, and were heard upon the sidewalk.
</p>
<p>Directly a voice cried, in the same slightly-raised monotone :
</p>
<p>" Nine o'clock and fifty minutes ! "
</p>
<p>This also passed from man to man, until it touched the street like a
</p>
<p>shudder.
</p>
<p>" Nine o'clock and fifty-five minutes !" said the same relentless voice,
</p>
<p>after the next interval, each of which narrowed to a lesser span the life of
</p>
<p>the good President.
</p>
<p>Ten o'clock here sounded, and conspiring echo said in reverberation :
</p>
<p>" Ten o'clock !"
</p>
<p>So like a creeping thing, from lip to lip, went :
</p>
<p>" Ten o'clock and five minutes."
</p>
<p>(An interval.)
</p>
<p>'' Ten <j' clock and ten minutes !"
</p>
<p>At this instant Wilkes Booth appeared in the door of the theater, and

</p>
<p>the men who had repeated the time so faithfully and so ominously scattered
</p>
<p>at his coming, as at some warning phantom. Fifteen minutes afterwards
</p>
<p>the telegraph wires were cut.
</p>
<p>All this is so dramatic that I fear to excite a laugh when I write it. But
</p>
<p>it is true and proven, and I do not say it but report it.
</p>
<p>All evil deeds go wrong. While the click of the pistol, taking tho
</p>
<p>President's life, went like a pang through the theater, Payne was spilling
</p>
<p>blood in Mr. Seward's house from threshold to sick chamber. But
</p>
<p>Booth's broken leg delayed him or made him lose his general calmness,
</p>
<p>and he and Harold left Payne to his fate.
</p>
<p>I have not adverted to the hole bored with a gimlet in the entry door
</p>
<p>of Mr. Lincoln's box, and cut out with a penknife. The theory that the
</p>
<p>pistol-ball of Booth passed through this hole is exploded. And the stage
</p>
<p>carpenter may have to answer for this little orifice with all his neck. For
</p>
<p>when Booth leaped from the box he strode straight across the stage by
</p>
<p>the footlights, reaching the prompter's post, which is immediately behind
</p>
<p>that private box opposite Mr. Lincoln. From this box to the stage door
</p>
<p>iu the rear, the passage-way leads behind the ends of the scenes, and if
</p>
<p>generally either closed up by one or more withdrawn scenes, or so narrow
</p>
<p>that only by doubling and turning sidewise can one pass along. On thi?
</p>
<p>fearful night, however, the scenes were so adjusted to the murderer's de-
</p>
<p>sign that he had a free aisle from the foot of the stage to the exit door.
</p>
<p>Within fifteen minutes after the murder the wires were severed entirely
</p>
<p>around the city, excepting only a secret wire for government uses, which
</p>
<p>leads to Old Point. I am told that by this wire the government reached
</p>
<p>the fortifications aro\ind Washington, first telegraphing all the way to Old
</p>
<p>Point, and then back to the outlying forts. This information comes to me
</p>
<p>from s) many creditable channels that I must concede it.
</p>
<p>Payne, having, as he thought, made an end of Mr. Seward  which
</p>
<p>would have been the case but for Robinson, the nurse  mounted his
</p>
<p>horse, and attempted to find Booth. But the town was in alarm, and he
</p>
<p>galloped at once for the open country, taking as he imagined, the proper
</p>
<p>)-oad for the East Branch. He rode at a killing pace, and when near
</p>
<p>Fort Lincoln, on the Baltimore pike, his horse threw him headlong. Afoot

</p>
<p>iiud bewildered, he resolved to return to the city, whose lights he could
</p>
<p>plainly see; but before doing so he concealed himself some time, and
</p>
<p>made some almost absurd efforts to disguise himself. Cutting a cross
</p>
<p>section from the woolen undershirt which covered his muscular arm, he
</p>
<p>made a rude c;ip of it, and threw away his bloody coat. This has since
</p>
<p>been found in the woods, and blood has been found also on his bosom and
</p>
<p>sleeves. He also spattered himself plentifully with mud and clay, and,
</p>
<p>taking an abandoned pick from the deserted intrenchments near by, he
</p>
<p>struck at once for Washington.
</p>
<p>By the providence which always attends murder, he reached ISivs. Sur-
</p>
<p>ratt's door just as the officers of the government were arresting her.
</p>
<p>They seized Payne at once, who had an awakward lie to urge in his de-
</p>
<p>fense  that he had come there to dig a trench. That night he dug a trench
</p>
<p>deep and broad enough for both of them to lie in forever. They washed
</p>
<p>his hands, and found them soft and womanish ; his pockets contained
</p>
<p>tooth and nail brushes and a delicate pocket knife. All this apparel con-
</p>
<p>sorted ill with his assumed character. He is, without doubt, Mr. Seward's
</p>
<p>attempted murderer.
</p>
<p>Coarse, and hard, and calm, Mrs. Surratt shut up her house after the
</p>
<p>murder, and waited with her daughters till the officers came. She was im-
</p>
<p>A Solution of the Mystery. 47
</p>
<p>perturbable, and rebuked her girls for weeping, and WQuld have gone to
</p>
<p>jail like a statue, but that in her extremity, Payne knocked at her door.
</p>
<p>He had come, he said, to dig a ditch for Mrs, Surratt, whom he very well
</p>
<p>knew. But Mrs. Surratt protested that she had ever seen the man at all,
</p>
<p>and had no ditch to clean.
</p>
<p>" How fortunate, girls," she said, " that these officers arc here ; this
</p>
<p>man miijht have murdered us all."
</p>
<p>Her effrontery stamps her a-s worthy of companionship with Booth.
</p>
<p>Payne has been identified by a lodger of Mrs. Surratt's, as having twice
</p>
<p>visited the house under the name of Wood. The girls will render valua-
</p>
<p>ble testimony in the trial. If John Surratt were in custody the links would
</p>
<p>be complete.
</p>
<p>Atzerott had a room almost directly over Vice-President Johnson's. He
</p>
<p>had all the materials to do murder, but lost spirit or opportunity. He ran
</p>
<p>away so hastily that all his arms and baggage were discovered ; a tremen-
</p>
<p>dous bowie-knife and a Colt's cavalry revolver were found between the
</p>
<p>mattresses of his bed. Booth's coat was also found there, showing con-
</p>
<p>spired flight in company, and in it three boxes of cartridges, a map of
</p>
<p>Maryland, gauntlets for riding, a spur and a handkerchief marked with the
</p>
<p>name of Booth's mother  a mother's souvenir for a murderer's pocket !
</p>
<p>Atzerott fled alone, and was found at the house of his uncle in Montgo-
</p>
<p>mery county. I do not know that any instrument of murder has ever made
</p>
<p>me thrill as when I drew this terrible bowie-knife from its sheath. Major
</p>
<p>O'Bierne, of New-York, was the instigator of Atzerott's discovery and
</p>
<p>arrest.
</p>
<p>I come now to the ride out of the city by the chief assassin and his dupe.
</p>
<p>Harold met Booth immediately after the crime in the next street, and
</p>
<p>they rode at a gallop past the Patent Office and over Capitol Hill.
</p>
<p>As they crossed the Eastern branch at Uniontown, Booth gave his proper
</p>
<p>name to the officer at the bridge. This, which would seem to have been
</p>
<p>foolish, was, in reality, very shrewd. The officers believed that one of
</p>
<p>Booth's accomplices had given this name in order to put them out of the
</p>
<p>real Booth's track. So they made effijrts elsewhere, and so Booth got a
</p>
<p>start. At midnight, precisely, the two horsemen stopped at Surrattsville,

<p>Booth remaining on his nag while Harold descended and knocked lustily at
</p>
<p>the door. Lloyd, the landlord, came down at once, when Harold pushed
</p>
<p>past him into the bar, and obtained a bottle of whiskey, some of which he
</p>
<p>gave to Booth immediately. While Booth was drinking, Harold went up
</p>
<p>stairs and brought down one of the carbines. Lloyd started to get the
</p>
<p>other, but Harold said :
</p>
<p>" We don't want it ; Booth has broken his leg and can't carry it."
</p>
<p>So the second carbine remained in the hall, where the officers afterward
</p>
<p>found it.
</p>
<p>As the two horsemen started to go off, Booth cried out to Lloyd :
</p>
<p>" Do you want to hear some news 1"
</p>
<p>" I don't care much about it," cried Lloyd, by his own account.
</p>
<p>"We have murdered," said Booth, "the Pres'dent and Secretary of
</p>
<p>State !"
</p>
<p>And with this horrible confession. Booth and Har^^ld dashed away in the
</p>
<p>midnight, across Prince George's county.
</p>
<p>On Saturday, before sunrise. Booth and Harold, who had ridden all night
</p>
<p>without stopping elsewhere, reached the house of Dr. Mudd, three miles
</p>
<p>from Bryantown. They contracted with him for twenty-five dollars in
</p>
<p>greenbacks to set the broken leg. Harold, whi> kue^v \^r. Mudd, iutro-

<p>ducetl Booth under another name, and stated that he had fallen froni his
</p>
<p>horse during the night. The doctor remarked of Booth that he draped the
</p>
<p>lower part of his face while t'he leg was being set; he was silent, and in
</p>
<p>pain. Having no splits in the house, they split up an old-fashioned wooden
</p>
<p>band-box and prepared them. The doctor was assisted, by an Englishman,
</p>
<p>who at the same time began to hew out a pair of crutches. The inferior
</p>
<p>bone of the left leg was brt)ken vertically across, and because vertically it
</p>
<p>did not yield when the crippled man walked upon it.
</p>
<p>The riding boot of Booth had to be cut from his foot : within were thb
</p>
<p>words "J. Wilkes."' The doctor says he did not notice these, but that
</p>
<p>visual defect may-C(jfst him his neck. The two men waited around the house
</p>
<p>all day, but toward evening they 'slipped their horses from the stable and
</p>
<p>rode away in the direction of Allen's Fresh.
</p>
<p>Below Bryantown run certain deep and slimy swamps, along the belt of
</p>
<p>these Booth and Harold picked up a negro named Swan, who volunteered
</p>
<p>to show them the road for two dollars ; they gave him five more to show
</p>
<p>them' the route to Allen's Fresh, but really wished, as their actions in-
</p>
<p>timated, to gain the house of one Sam. Coxe, a notorious rebel, and probably
</p>
<p>well advised of the plot. They reached the house at midnight. It is a
</p>
<p>fine dwelling, one of the best m Maryland. And at\er hallooing for some
</p>
<p>time, Coxe came down to the door himself As soon as he opened it and
</p>
<p>beheld who the strangers were, he instantly blew out a candle he held in his
</p>
<p>hand, and without a word pulled them into the house, the negro remaining
</p>
<p>in the yard. The confederates remained in COxe's house till 4 a. m., during
</p>
<p>which time the negro saw them drink and eat heartily ; but when they re-
</p>
<p>appeared they sjioke in a loud tone, so that Swan could hear them, against
</p>
<p>the hospitality of Coxe. All this was meant to influence the darkey ; but
</p>
<p>their motives were as apparent as their words. He conducted them three
</p>
<p>miles further on, when they told him that now they knew the way, and
</p>
<p>giving him five dollars more  making twelve in all  told him to go back.
</p>
<p>But when the negro, in the dusk of the morning, looked after them as he
</p>
<p>receded, he saw that both horses' heads were turned once more toward
</p>
<p>Coxe's, and it was this man, doubtless, who harbored the fugitives from
</p>
<p>Sunday to Thursday, aided, possibly, by such neighbors as the Wilsons and

<p>At the point where Booth crossed the Potomac the shores are very shal-

<p>low, and one must wade out some distance to where a boat will float. A

<p>THE DETECTIVES' STORIES.
</p>
<p>a
</p>
<p>Washington, Mav 2  e. m.
</p>
<p>The police resources of the country have been fairly tested during the
</p>
<p>past two weeks. Under the circumstances, the shrewdness and energy of
</p>
<p>both municipal and national detectives have been proven good. The latter
</p>
<p>body has had a too partial share of the applause thus far, while the great
</p>
<p>efforts of our New-York and other officers have been overlooked. In the
</p>
<p>crowning success of Doherty, Conger, and Baker on the Virginia side of
</p>
<p>the water we have forgotten the as vigorous and better sustained pursuit
</p>
<p>on the Maryland side.
</p>
<p>Yet the Secretary of War has thanked all concerned, especially referring
</p>
<p>to many excellent leaders in the long hunt through Charles and St. Mary's
</p>
<p>counties. Here the military and civil forces together amounted to quite a
</p>
<p>small army, and constituted by far the largest police organization ever
</p>
<p>known on this side of the Aclantic.
</p>
<p>I think the adventures and expedients of these public servants worthy of
</p>
<p>a column. It would be out of all proportion to pass them by when we
</p>
<p>devote a dozen lines to every petty larceny and shoplifting.
</p>
<p>On the Friday night of the murder the departments were absolutely
</p>
<p>paralyzed. The murderers had three good hours for escape ; they had
</p>
<p>evaded the pursuit of lightning by snapping the telegraph wires, and rumor
</p>
<p>filled the town with so many reports that the first valuable hours, which
</p>
<p>should have been used to follow hard after them, were consumed in feverish
</p>
<p>efforts to know the real extent of the assassination.

</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, however, or on Saturday morning early, the
</p>
<p>provost and special police force got on the scent, and military in squada
</p>
<p>were dispatched close upon their heels.
</p>
<p>Three grand pursuit* were organized : one reaching up the north bank
</p>
<p>of the Potomac toward Chain bridge, to prevent escape by that direction
</p>
<p>into Virginia, where Mosby, it was suspected, waited to hail the murderers;
</p>
<p>A second starting from Richmond, Va., northward, forming a bn.ad
</p>
<p>advancing picket or skirmish line between the Blue Ridge and the br;>ad
</p>
<p>sea-running streams ;
</p>
<p>A third to scour the peninsula towards Point Lookout.
</p>
<p>The latter region became the only one well examined ; the northern x-
</p>
<p>pedition failed until advised from below to capture Atzerott, and faiit-d to
</p>
<p>capture Payne. Yet there were cogent probabilities that the assassin bad
</p>
<p>taken this route; for Mosby would have given them the right hand of
</p>
<p>fellowship.

</p>
<p>When that guerrilla heard of Booth's feat, said Captain Jett, tio ei
</p>
<p>claimed :
</p>
<p>" Now, by ! I could take that man in my arms."
</p>
<p>i Washington, as a precautionary measure, was doubly picketed at once;
</p>
<p>the authorities in all northern towns advised of the personnel of the mur
</p>
<p>derer, and requests made of the detective chiefs in Baltimore, Philadelphia,
</p>
<p>and New-York, to forward to Washington without delay their best decoys.
</p>
<p>A court of inquiry was organized on the moment, and early in the week
</p>
<p>succeeding rewards were offered. An individual, and not the government,
</p>
<p>offered the first rewards.
</p>
<p>There were two men without whom the hunt would have gone astray
</p>
<p>many times.
</p>
<p>John S. Young, chief of the New- York detective force, a powerful and
</p>
<p>resolute man, whose great weight and strength are matched by boundless
</p>
<p>energy, and both subordinate to a head as clear as the keen and searching
</p>
<p>warrant of his eye. This man has been in familiar converse with every
</p>
<p>rebel agent in the Canadas, and is feared by them as they fear the fates of
</p>
<p>Beall and Kennedy. Without being a sensationist, he has probably ren-
</p>
<p>dered the cleverest services of the war to the general government. They
</p>
<p>sent for him immediately afler the tragedy, and he stopped on the way for
</p>
<p>his old police companion. Marshal Murray. The latter's face and figure
</p>
<p>are familiar to all who ^now New-York ; he resembles an admiral on his
</p>
<p>quarter-deck ; he is a detective of fair and excellent repute, and has a some-
</p>
<p>what novel pride in what he calls " the most beautiful gallows in the
</p>
<p>United States."
</p>
<p>These officials were ordered to visit Colonel Ingraham's office and examine
</p>
<p>the little evidence on hand. They and their tried officers formed a junction
</p>
<p>on Sunday afternoon with the large detective force of Provost-Marshal
</p>
<p>Major O'Bierne. The latter commands the District of Columbia civil and
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>The detective force of Young and Murray consisted of Officers Radford,

<p>Baltimore.
</p>
<p>Major O'Bierne's immediate aids were Detectives John Lee, Lloyd,
</p>
<p>Gavigan, Coddingham, and Williams.
</p>
<p>A detachment of the Philadelphia detective police force  Officers Tag-
</p>
<p>gert, George Smith, and Carlin, reporting to Colonel Baker  went in the
</p>
<p>direction of the North Pole; everybody is on the que vive for them.
</p>
<p>To the provost-marshal of Baltimore, MacPhail, who knew the tone and
</p>
<p>bearino- of the ooiintry throughout, was joined the zealous co-operation of
</p>
<p>Officer Lloyd, of Major O'Bierne's staff, Aho had a personal feeling against
</p>
<p>the secessionists of lower Maryland ; they had once driven him away for
</p>
<p>his loyalty, and had reserved their hospitality for assassins.
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Gushing,! am informed, also rendered important
</p>
<p>services to the government in connection with the police operations. Vol-
</p>
<p>unteer detectives, such as Ex-Marshal Lewis and Angelis, were plentiful;
</p>
<p>it is probable that in the ptch of the excitement five hundred detective
</p>
<p>officers were in and around Washington city. At the same time the secret
</p>
<p>police of Richmond abandoned their ordinary business, and devoted thenir
</p>
<p>selves solely to this overshadowing offense.
</p>
<p>No citizen, in these terrible days, knows what eyes were upon him as he
</p>
<p>talked and walked, nor how his stature and guise were keenly scanned by
</p>
<p>The Detectives' Stories. 51
</p>
<p> folks who passed him absent-faced, yet with his mental portrait carefully
</p>
<p>turned over, the while some invisible hand clutched a revolver, and held a
</p>
<p>life or death challenge upon his lips.
</p>
<p>The military forces were commanded by Colonel Welles, of the Twenty-
</p>
<p>sixth Michigan regiment, whose activity and zeal were amply sustained by
</p>
<p>Colonel Clendenning, of the Eighth Dlinois cavalry, probably the finest
</p>
<p>body of horse in the service.
</p>
<p>The first party to take the South Maryland road was dispatched by Ma-
</p>
<p>jor O'Bierne, and commanded by Lieutenant Lovett, of the Veteran Re-
</p>
<p>serves. It consisted of twenty-five cavalry men, with detectives Cotting-
</p>
<p>ham, Lloyd, and Gavigan ; these latter, with the lieutenant, kept well in
</p>
<p>advance. They made inquiries of a soothing and cautious churactpr, but
</p>
<p>saw nothing suspicious until they arrived at Piscataway, where an unknown
</p>
<p>man, some distance ahead, observed them, and took to the woods. This
</p>
<p>was on Sunday night, forty hours after the murder.
</p>
<p>Guided by Officer Lloyd, the little band dashed on, arriving at Bryan-
</p>
<p>town on Tuesday. Here they arrested John Lloyd, of the hotel ut Surratts-
</p>
<p>ville, of whom they had previously inquired for the murderers, and he had
</p>
<p>said positively that he neither knew them nor had seen anybody whatever
</p>
<p>on the night of the crime. He was returning in a wagun, with his wife,
</p>
<p>w^hom he had ordered, the day before, to go on a visit to Allen's Fresh.
</p>
<p>The Monday afterward he started to bring her back. This woman, fright-
</p>
<p>ened at the arrest, acknowledged at once that in her husband's conduct
</p>
<p>there was some inexplicable mystery. lie was taciturn and defiant as be-
</p>
<p>fore, until confronted by some of his old Union neighbors.
</p>
<p>The few Unionists of Prince George's and Charles counties, long perse
</p>
<p>cuted and intimidated, now came forward and gave important testimony.
</p>
<p>Among these was one Roby, a very fat and very zealous old gentleman,
</p>
<p>whose professions were as ample as his perspiration. lie told the officers
</p>
<p>of the secret meetings for conspiracy's sake at Lloyd's Hotel, and although
</p>
<p>a very John Gilpin on horseback, rode here and there to his great loss of
</p>
<p>wind and repose, fastening fire-coals upon the guilty or suspected.
</p>
<p>Lloyd was turned over to Mr. Cottingham, who had established a jail at
</p>
<p>Robytown ; that night his house was searched, and Booth's carbine lound

</p>
<p>hidden in the wall. Three days afterward, Lloyd himself confessed  and
</p>
<p>his neck is quite nervous at this writing.
</p>
<p>This little party, under the untiring Lovett, examined all the farm-houses
</p>
<p>below Washington, resorting to many shrewd expedients, and taking note
</p>
<p>of the great swamps to the east of Port Tobacco ; they reached Newport
</p>
<p>at last and fastened tacit guilt upon many residents.
</p>
<p>Beyond Bryan^own they overhauled the residence of Doctor Mudd and
</p>
<p>found Booth's boot. This was before Lloyd confessed, and was the first
</p>
<p>positive trace the officers had that they were really close upon the assas-
</p>
<p>sins.
</p>
<p>I do not recall anything more wild and startling than this vague and dan-
</p>
<p>gerous exploration of a dimly known, hostile, and ignorant country. To
</p>
<p>these few detectives we owe much of the subsequent successful prosecution
</p>
<p>of the pursuit. They were the Hebrew spies.
</p>
<p>By this time the country was filling up with soldiers, but previously a
</p>
<p>second memorable detective party went out under the personal command
</p>
<p>of Mijor O'Bierne. It consisted, besides that officer, of Lee, D'Angeilis,
</p>
<p>Callahan, Hoey, Bostwick, Hanover, Bevins, and McHenry, and embarked
</p>
<p>at Washington on a steam-tug for Ghappell's Point. Here a military sta-
</p>
<p>tion had long been established for the prevention of blockade and mail-rua

</p>
<p>ning across the Potomac. It was commanded by Lieutenant Laverty,and
</p>
<p>garrisoned by sixty-five men. On Tuesday night, Major O'Bierne's party
</p>
<p>reached this place, and soon afterwards, a telegraph station was established
</p>
<p>here by an invaluable man to the expedition. Captain Beckwitn, General
</p>
<p>Grant's chief cypher operator, who tapped the Point Lookout wire, and
</p>
<p>placed the War Department within a moment's reach of the theater of
</p>
<p>events.
</p>
<p>Major O'Bierne's party started at once over the worst road in the world
</p>
<p>for Port Tobacco.
</p>
<p>If any plrice in the world is utterly given over to depravity, it is Port
</p>
<p>Tobacco. From this town, by a sinuous creek, there is flat bo;it navigation
</p>
<p>to the Potomac, and across that river to Mattox's creek. Before the war
</p>
<p>Port Tobacco was the seat of a tobacco aristocracy and a haunt of negro
</p>
<p>traders. It passed very naturally into a rebel post for blockade-runners
</p>
<p>and a rebel post-office general. "Gambling, corner fighting, and shooting
</p>
<p>matches were its lyceum education. Violence and ignorance had every suf-
</p>
<p>/rage in the town. Its people were smugglers, to all intents, and there was
</p>
<p>nei'ther Bible nor geography to the whole region adjacent. Assassination
</p>
<p>was never very unpopular at Port Tobacco, and when its victim was a north-
</p>
<p>ern president it became quite heroic. A month before the murder a pro-
</p>
<p>vost-marshal near by wa? slain in his bed-ehamber. For such a town and
</p>
<p>district the detective police were the only effective missionaries. The hotel
</p>
<p>here is called the Brawner House ; it has a bar in the nethermost cellar,
</p>
<p>and its patrons, carousing in that imperfect light, look like the denizens of
</p>
<p>some burglar's crib, talking robbery between their cups; its dining-room
</p>
<p>is dark and tumble-down, and the cuisine bears traces of Caffir origin ; a
</p>
<p>barbecue is nothing to a dinner there. The Court House of Port Tobacco
</p>
<p>is the most superflous house in the place, except the church. It stands in
</p>
<p>the center of the town in a square, and the dwellings lie about it closely,
</p>
<p>as if to throttle justice. Five hundred people exist in Port Tobacco ; life
</p>
<p>there reminds me, in connection with the slimy river and the adjacent
</p>
<p>swamps, of the great reptile period of the world, when iguanadons and
</p>
<p>pterodactyls and pleosauri ate each other.

<p>visited Lot. They pretended to be enquiring for friends, or to have busi
</p>
<p>ness designs, and the first people they heard of were Harold and Atzerott.
</p>
<p>The latter had visited Port Tobacco three weeks before the murder, and in-
</p>
<p>timated at that time his design of fleeing the country. But everybody
</p>
<p>denied having seen him subsequent to the crime.
</p>
<p>Atzerott had been in town just prior to the crime. He had been living with
</p>
<p>a widow woman named Mrs. Wheeler, by whom he had several children, and
</p>
<p>she was immediately called upon by Major O'Bierne. He did not tell her
</p>
<p>what Atzerott had done, but vaguely hinted that he had committed some
</p>
<p>terrible crime, and that since he had done her wrong, she could vindicate
</p>
<p>both herself and justice by telling his whereabouts. The woman admitted
</p>
<p>that Atzerott had been her bane, but she loved him, and refused to betray
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>His trunk was found in her garret, and in it the key to his paint shop m

<p>Port Tobacco. The latter was fruitlessly searched, but the probable where-
</p>
<p>abouts of Atzerott in Mongomery county obtained, and Major O'Bierne tele-
</p>
<p>graphing there immediately, the desperate fellow was found and locked up.
</p>
<p>A man named Crangle who had succeeded Atzerott in Mrs. Wheeler's pli-

<p>people were indicated or "spotted" as in no wise angry at the President's
</p>
<p>taking oHj and for all such a provost prison was established.
</p>
<p>A few miles from Port Tobacco dwelt a solitary woman, who, when ques-
</p>
<p>tioned, said that for many nights she had heard, after she had retired to bed,
</p>
<p>a man enter her cellar and lie there all night, departing before dawn. Ma-
</p>
<p>jor O'Bierne and the detectives ordered her to place a lamp in her window
</p>
<p>the next night she heard him enter, and at dark they established a cordon
</p>
<p>of armed officers around the place. At midnight punctually she exhibited
</p>
<p>the light, when the officers broke into the house and thoroughly searched it,
</p>
<p>without result. Yet the woman positively asserted that she had heard the
</p>
<p>man enter.
</p>
<p>It was afterward found that she was of diseased mind.
</p>
<p>By this time the military had come up in considerable numbers, and Ma-
</p>
<p>jor O'Bierne was enabled to confer with Major Wait, of the Eighth Illi-
</p>
<p>nois.
</p>
<p>The major had pushed on Monday night to Leonardstown, and pretty
</p>
<p>well overhauled that locality.
</p>
<p>It was at this time that preparations were made to hunt the swamps
</p>
<p>around Chapmantown, Beantovvn, and Allen's Fresh. Booth had been en-
</p>
<p>tirely lost since his departure from Mudd's house, and it was believed that
</p>
<p>he had either pushed on for the Potomac or taken to the swamps. The
</p>
<p>officers sagaciously determined to follow him to the one and to explore the
</p>
<p>other.
</p>
<p>The swamps tributary to the various branches of the Wicomico river,
</p>
<p>of which the chief feeder is Allen's creek, bear various names, such as Jor-
</p>
<p>dan's swamp, Atchall's swamp, and Scrub swamp. There are dense growths
</p>
<p>pi dogwood, gum, and beech, planted in sluices of water and bog ; and their
</p>
<p>width varies from a half mile to four miles, while their length is upwards
</p>
<p>of sixteen miles. Frequent deep ponds dot this wilderness place, with here
</p>
<p>and there a stretch of dry soil, but no human being inhabits the malarious
</p>
<p>extent ; even a hunted murderer would shrink from hiding there. Serpents
</p>
<p>and slimy lizards are the only denizens ; sometimes the coon takes refuge
</p>
<p>in this desert from the hounds, and in the soft mud a thousand odorous
</p>
<p>muskrats delve, with now and then a tremorous otter. But not even the

</p>
<p>hunted negro dares to fathom the treacherous clay, nor make himself a fel-
</p>
<p>low of the slimy reptiles which reign absolute in this terrible solitude. Here
</p>
<p>the soldiers prepa.'ed to seek for the President's assassin, and no search of
</p>
<p>the kind has ever been so tnorough and patient. The Shawnee, in his strong
</p>
<p>hold of despair in the heart of Okeefeuokee, would scarcely have changed
</p>
<p>homes with Wilkes Booth and David Harold, hiding in this inhuman
</p>
<p>country.
</p>
<p>The military forces deputed to pursue the fugitives were seven hundred
</p>
<p>men of the Eighth Illinois cavalry, six hundred men of the Twenty-second
</p>
<p>Colored troops, and one hundred men of the Sixteenth New York. These
</p>
<p>swept the swamps by detachments, the mass of them dismounted, with
</p>
<p>cavalry at the belts of clearing, interspersed with detectives at frequent in-
</p>
<p>tervals in the rear. They first formed a strong picket cordon entirely
</p>
<p>around the swamps, and then, drawn up in two orders of battle, advanced
</p>
<p>boldly into the bogs by two lines of march. One party swept the swamps
</p>
<p>longitudinally, the other pushed straight across their smallest diameter.
</p>
<p>A similar march has not been made during the war ; the soldiers were
</p>
<p>only a few paces apart, and in steady order they took the ground as it came,
</p>
<p>now plunging to their arm-pits in foul sluices of gangrened water, now
</p>
<p>The Life, Crhne, and Capture of John \Vilke$ Booth.
</p>
<p>hopelessly submerged in slime, now attacked by legions of wood ticks, now
</p>
<p>tempting some unfaithful log or greenishly solid morass, and plunging to
</p>
<p>the tip of the skull in poison stagnation ; the tree boughs rent their uni-
</p>
<p>forms ; they came out upon dry land, many of them vithout a rag of gar-
</p>
<p>ment scratched, and gashed, and spent, repugnant to themselves, and dis-
</p>
<p>gusting to those who saw them ; but not one trace of Booth or Harold was
</p>
<p>any where found. Wherever they might be, the swamps did not contain
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>While all this was going on, a force started from Point Lookout, and
</p>
<p>swept the narrow necks of Saint Mary's quite up to Medley's Neck. To
</p>
<p>complete the search in this part of the country, Colonel Wells and Major
</p>
<p>O'Bierne started with a force of cavalry and infantry for Chappel Point;
</p>
<p>they took the entire peninsula as before, and marched in close skirmish
</p>
<p>line across it, but without finding anything of note. The matter of inclosing
</p>
<p>a house was by cavalry advances, which held all the avenues till mounted
</p>
<p>detectives came up. Many strange and ludicrous adventures occured on
</p>
<p>each of these expeditions. While the forces were going up Cobb's neck,
</p>
<p>there was a counter forde coming down from Allen's Fresh.
</p>
<p>Major O'Bierne started for Leonardstown with his detective force, and
</p>
<p>played off Lave rty as Booth, and Hoey as Harold. These two advanced
</p>
<p>to fiirm-houses and gave their assumed names, asking at the same time for
</p>
<p>assistance and shelter. They were generally avoided, except by one man
</p>
<p>named Claggert, who told them they might hide in the woods behind his
</p>
<p>house. When Claggert was arrested, however he stated that he meant to
</p>
<p>hide them only to give them up. While on this adventure, a man who had
</p>
<p>heard of the reward came very near shooting Laverty. The ruhe now be-
</p>
<p>came hazardous and the detectives resumed their real characters. %
</p>
<p>I have not time to go into the detail of this long and excellent hunt. My
</p>
<p>letter of yesterday described how the detectives of Mr. Young and Marshal
</p>
<p>Murray examined the negro Swan, and traced Booth to the house of Sam
</p>
<p>Coxe, the richest rebel in Charles county. There is a gap in the evidence
</p>
<p>between the arrival of Booth at this place and his crossing the Potomac
</p>
<p>above Swan Point, in a stolen or purposely-provided canoe. But as Coxe's
</p>
<p>house is only ten miles from the river, it is possible that he made the pas-

<p>sage of the intermediate country undiscovered
</p>
<p>One Mills, a rebel mail-carrier, also arrested, saw Booth and Harold
</p>
<p>lurking along the river bank on Friday ; he referred Major O'Bierne to one
</p>
<p>Claggert, a rebel, as having seen them also ; but Claggert held his tongue,
</p>
<p>and went to jail. On Saturday night. Major O'Bierne, thus assured, also
</p>
<p>crossed the Potomac with his detectives to Boon's farm, where the.fugi-
</p>
<p>tives had landed. While collecting information here a gunboat swung up
</p>
<p>the stream, and threatened to fire on the party.
</p>
<p>It was now night, and all the party worn to the ground with long travel
</p>
<p>and want of sleep. Lieutenant Laverty's men went a short distance down
</p>
<p>the country and gave up, but Major O'Bierne, with a single man, pushed all
</p>
<p>night to King George's court-house, and next day, Sumiay, re-em barked for
</p>
<p>Chappell's Point. Hence he telegraphed his information, and asked permis-
</p>
<p>sion to pursue, promising to catch the assassins before they reached Port
</p>
<p>Jioyal.
</p>
<p>rhis the department refused. Colonel Baker's men were delegated tc
</p>
<p>make th',-. pursuit with rhe able Lieutenant Doherty, and O'Bierne, who was
</p>
<p>the most active, and successful spirit in the chase, returned to Washington,
</p>
<p>cheerful and contented.
</p>
<p>The Martyr. 57
</p>
<p>At Mrs. Surratt's Washington house, at the Pennsylvania TTotol, Wash-
</p>
<p>ington, and at Surrattsville, the Booth plot was almost entirely arranged.
</p>
<p>These three places will be relics of conspiracy forever.
</p>
<p>Harold said to Lieutenant Doherty, after the latter had dragged him
</p>
<p>from the barn.
</p>
<p>" Who's that man in there * It can't be Booth ; he told me his name was
</p>
<p>Lovd."
</p>
<p>He further said that he had begged food for Booth from house to house
</p>
<p>while the latter hid in the woods.
</p>
<p>The confederate captain, Willie Jett, who had given Booth a HP behind
</p>
<p>his saddle from Port Royal to Garrett's farm, was then courting a Mias
</p>
<p>Goldmann at Bowling Green ; his traveling companions were Lieutenants
</p>
<p>Ruggles and Burbridge.
</p>
<p>Payne, the assassin of the Sewards, was arrested by Officers, Sampson,
</p>
<p>of the sub-treasury, and Devoe, acting under General Alcott. The latter
</p>
<p>had besides, Officers Marsh and Clancy (a stenographer).
</p>
<p>The reward for the capture of Booth will be distributed between very
</p>
<p>many men. The negro. Swan, will get as much of it as he deserves. It
</p>
<p>amounts to about eiglity thousand dollars, but the War Department may in-
</p>
<p>increase it at discretion. The entire rewards amount to a hundred and
</p>
<p>sixty odd thousand. Major O'Bierne should get a large part of it as well.
</p>
<p>This story which I must close abruptly, deserves to be re-written, with
</p>
<p>all its accessory endeavours. What I have said is in skeleton merely,
</p>
<p>and far from exhaustive.

<p>LETTER VII.
</p>
<p>THE MARTYB.
</p>
<p>Washingtoh, May 14.
</p>
<p>I am sitting in the President's office. He was here very lately, but he
</p>
<p>will not return to dispossess me of this high-backed chair he filled so long,
</p>
<p>nor resume his daily work at the table where I am writing.
</p>
<p>There are here only Major Hay and the friend who accompanies me. A
</p>
<p>bright-faced boy runs in and out, darkly attired, so that his fob-chain of gold
</p>
<p>is the only relief to his mourning garb. This is little Tad., the pet of the
</p>
<p>White House. That great death, with which the world rings, has made

</p>
<p>upon him only the light impression which all things make upon childhood.
</p>
<p>He will live to be a man pointed out everywhere, for his father's sake ; and
</p>
<p>as folks look at him, the tableau of the murder will seem to encircle him.
</p>
<p>The room is long and high, and so thickly hung with maps that the color
</p>
<p>of the wall cannot be discerned. The President's table at which I am seat-
</p>
<p>ed, adjoins a window at the farthest corner ; and to the left of my chair as
</p>
<p>I recline in it, there is a large table before an empty grate, around which
</p>
<p>there are many chairs, where the cabinet used to assemble. The carpet is
</p>
<p>trodden thin, and the brilliance of its dyes is lost. The furniture is of the
</p>
<p>formal cabinet class, stately and semi-comfortable; there are book cass,

</p>
<p>sprinkled with the sparse library of a country lawyer, but lately plethoric,
</p>
<p>like the thin, body which has departed in its coffin. They are taking away
</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln's private effects, to deposit them wheresoever his family may
</p>
<p>abide, and the emptiness of the place, on this sunny Sunday, revives that
</p>
<p>feeline: of desolation from which the land has scarce recovered. I rise
</p>
<p>from my seat and examine the maps; they are from the coast survey and
</p>
<p>engineer departments, and exhibit all the contested grounds of the war ;
</p>
<p>there are pencil lines upon them where some one has traced the route of
</p>
<p>armies, and planned the strategic circumferences of campaigns. Was it
</p>
<p>the dead President who so followed the march of empire, and dotted the
</p>
<p>sites of shock and overthrow 1
</p>
<p>Here is the Manassas country  here the long reach of the wasted Sheii-
</p>
<p>andoah ; here the wavy line of the James and the sinuous peninsula. The
</p>
<p>wide campagna of the gulf country sways in the Potomac breeze that fil-
</p>
<p>ters in at the window, and the Mississippi climbs up the wall, with blotches
</p>
<p>of blue and red to show where blood gushed at the bursting of deadly
</p>
<p>bombs. So, in the half-gloomy, half-grand apartment, roamed the tall and
</p>
<p>wrinkled figure whom the country had summoned from his plain home into
</p>
<p>mighty history, with the geography of the republic drawn into a narrow
</p>
<p>compass so that he might lay his great brown hand upon it everywhere.
</p>
<p>And walking to and fro, to and fro, to measure the destinies of arms, he
</p>
<p>often stopped, with his thoughtful eyes upon the carpet, to ask if his life
</p>
<p>were real and if he were the arbiter of so tremendous issues, or whether
</p>
<p>it was not all a fever-dream, snatched from his sofa in the routine office of
</p>
<p>the Prairie state.
</p>
<p>There is but one picture on the marble mantel over the cold grate  John
</p>
<p>Bright, a photograph.
</p>
<p>1 i an well imagine how the mind of Mr. Lincoln often went afiir to the
</p>
<p>face of Bright, who said so kindly things of him when Europp was mock-
</p>
<p>ing his homely guise and provincial phraseology. To Mr. Luico^^ ^'^hn
</p>
<p>Bright was the standard-bearer of America and democracy in the old
</p>
<p>world. He thrilled over Bright's bold denunciations of peer and " Privv
</p>
<p>lege," and stretched his long arm across the Atlantic to take that daring
</p>
<p>Quaker innovator by the hand.

</p>
<p>I see some books on the table ; perhaps they have lain there undisturbed
</p>
<p>since the reader's dimming eyes grew nerveless. A parliamentary manual,
</p>
<p>a Thesaurus, and two books of humor, " Orpheus C. Kerr," and " Artemus
</p>
<p>Ward." These last were read by Mr. Lincoln in the pauses of his hard
</p>
<p>day's labor. Their tenure here bears out the popular verdict of his par-
</p>
<p>tiality for a good joke ; and, through the window, from the seat of Mr.
</p>
<p>Lincoln, I see across the grassy grounds of the capitol, the broken shaft of
</p>
<p>the Washington Monument, the long bridge and the fort-tipped Heights of
</p>
<p>Arlington, reaching down to the shining river side. These scenes he looked
</p>
<p>at often to catch some freshness of leaf and water, and often raised the sash
</p>
<p>to let the world rush in where only the nation abided, and hence on that
</p>
<p>awful night, he departed early, to forget this room and its close applications
</p>
<p>in the abandon of the theater.
</p>
<p>I wonder if that were the least of Booth's crimes  to slay this public
</p>
<p>servant in the stolen hour of recreation he enjoyed but seldom. We
</p>
<p>worked his life out here, and killed him when he asked a holiday.
</p>
<p>Outside of this room there is an office, where his secretaries sat  a room
</p>
<p>more narrow but as long  and opposite this adjacent office, a second door,
</p>
<p>directly behind Mr. Lincoln's chair leads by a private passage to his family
</p>
<p>quarters. This passage is his only monument in the building; he added
</p>
<p>/
</p>
<p>The Jdartyr. 59
</p>
<p>nor subtracted nothing else ; it tells a long story of duns and loiterers,
</p>
<p>contract-hunters and seekers for commissions, garrulous parents on paltry
</p>
<p>errands, toadies without measure and talkers without conscience. They
</p>
<p>pressed upon him through the great door opposite his window, and hat in
</p>
<p>hand, come courtsying to his chair, with an obsequious "Mr. President!"
</p>
<p>If he dared; though the chief magistrate and commander of the army an '
</p>
<p>navy, to go out of the great door, these vampires leaped upon him with
</p>
<p>their Baliylonian pleas, and barred his walk to his hearthside. He could
</p>
<p>not insult them since it was not in his nature, and perhaps many of them
</p>
<p>had really urgent errands. So he calltnl up the carpenter and ordered a
</p>
<p>strategic route cut from his office to his hearth, and perhaps told of it after
</p>
<p>with much merriment.
</p>
<p>Here should be written the biography of his official life  in the room
</p>
<p>where have concentrated all the wires of action, and where have proceeded
</p>
<p>the resolves which vitalized in historic deeds. But only the great measures,
</p>
<p>however carried out, were conceived in this office. The little ones proceeded
</p>
<p>from other places.
</p>
<p>Here once came Mr, Stanton, saying in his hard and positive way :
</p>
<p>"Mr. Lincoln, I have found it expedient to disgrace and arrest General
</p>
<p>Stone."
</p>
<p>" Stanton," said Mr. Lincoln, with an emotion of pain, " when you con-
</p>
<p>sidered it necessary to imprison General Stone, I am glad you did not
</p>
<p>consult me about it."
</p>
<p>And for lack of such consultation. General Stone, I learn, now lies a
</p>
<p>maniac in the asylum. The groundless pretext, upon which he suffered the
</p>
<p>reputation of treason, issued from the Department of War  not from this
</p>
<p>office.
</p>
<p>But as to his biography, it is to be written by Colonel Nicolay and
</p>
<p>Major Hay. They are to go to Paris together, one as attache of legation,
</p>
<p>the other as consul, and while there, will undertake the labor. They are
</p>
<p>the only men who know his life jvell enough to exhaust it, having followed
</p>
<p>his official tasks as closely as they shared his social hours.
</p>
<p>Major Hay is a gentleman of literary force. Colonel Nicolay has a fine

</p>
<p>judgment of character and public measures. Together they should satisfy
</p>
<p>both curiosity and history.
</p>
<p>As 1 hear from my acquaintances here these episodes of the President's
</p>
<p>life, I recall many reminiscences of his ride from Springfield to Harrisburg,
</p>
<p>over much of which I passed. Then he lefl home and became an inhabi-
</p>
<p>tant of history. His face was solid and healthy, his step young, his speech
</p>
<p>and manner bold and kindly. I saw him at Trenton stand in the Legis-
</p>
<p>lature, and say, in his conversational intonation :
</p>
<p>" We may have to put the foot down firm."
</p>
<p>How should we have hung upon his accents then had we anticipated hia
</p>
<p>virtues and his fate.
</p>
<p>Death is requisite to make opinion grave. We looked upon Mr. Lincoln
</p>
<p>then as an amusing sensation, and there was much guffaw as he was re-
</p>
<p>farded by the populace ; he had not passed out of partisan ownership.
</p>
<p><ittle by little, afterward, he won esteem, and often admiration, until the
</p>
<p>measure of his life was full, and the victories he had achieved made the
</p>
<p>world applaud him. Yet, at this date, the President was sadly changed
</p>
<p>Four years of perplexity and devotion had wrinkled his face, and stooped
</p>
<p>his shoulders, and the failing eyes that glared upon the play closed as hi?
</p>
<p>mission was completed, and the world had been educated enough to com
</p>
<p>prehend him.
</p>
<p>60 The Lifty Crime, and Capture of John Wilkes Booth.
</p>
<p>The White House has been more of a Republican mansion under his con-
</p>
<p>trol than for many administrations. Uncouth guests came to it ol'ten,
</p>
<p>typical of the simple western civilization of which he was a graduate,
</p>
<p>and while no coarse altercation has ever ensued, the portal has swung
</p>
<p>wide for five years.
</p>
<p>A friend, connected with a Washington newspaper, told me that he had
</p>
<p>occasion to see Mr. Lincoln one evening, and found that the latter had
</p>
<p>gone to bed. But he was told to sit down in the ofiice, and directly the
</p>
<p>President entered. He wore only a night shirt, and his long, lank hirsute
</p>
<p>limbs, as he sat down, inclined the guest to laughter. Mr. Lincoln dis-
</p>
<p>posed of his request at once, and manifested a desire to talk. So he
</p>
<p>reached for the cane which my friend carried and conversed in this manner:
</p>
<p>" I always used a cane when I was a boy. It was a freak of mine. My
</p>
<p>favorite one was a knotted beech stick, and I carved the head myself.
</p>
<p>There's a mighty amount of character in sticks. Don't you think so ?
</p>
<p>You have seen these fishing poles that fit into a cane? Well, that was an
</p>
<p>old idea of mine. Dogwood clubs were favorite ones with the boys. I
</p>
<p>'spose they use'em yet. Hickory is too heavy, unless you get it from h
</p>
<p>young sapling. Have you ever noticed how a stick in one's hand will
</p>
<p>change his appearance? Old women and witches would'nt look so without
</p>
<p>sticks. Meg Merrilies understands that."
</p>
<p>Li this way my friend, who is a clerk in a newspaper office, heard the
</p>
<p>President talk for an hour. The undress of the man and the witness of his
</p>
<p>subject would be staples for merriment if we did not reflect that his great-
</p>
<p>ness was of no conventional cast, that the playfulness of his nature and the
</p>
<p>simplicity of his illustration lightened public business but never arrested
</p>
<p>it.
</p>
<p>Another gentleman, whom I know, visited the President in high dudgeon
</p>
<p>one night. He was a newspaper proprietor and one of his editors had been
</p>
<p>arrested.
</p>
<p>" Mr. Lincoln," he said, " 1 have been off electioneering for your re-elec-
</p>
<p>tion, and in my absence you have, had my editor arrested. 1 won't stand
</p>
<p>it, sir. I have fought better administrations than yours."
</p>
<p>"Why, John," said the President, "I don't know much about it. I

</p>
<p>suppose your boys have been too euterprizing. The fact is, 1 don't inter-
</p>
<p>fere with the press much, but I suppose I am responsible."
</p>
<p>" I want you to order the man's release to-night," said the applicant.
</p>
<p>" I shan't leave here till I get it. In fact, 1 am the man who should be
</p>
<p>arrested. Why don't you send me to Capitol Hill ?"
</p>
<p>This idea pleased the President exceedingly. 'He laughed the other into
</p>
<p>good humor.
</p>
<p>" In fact," he said, " I am under restraint here, and glad of any pretext
</p>
<p>to release a journalist."
</p>
<p>So he wrote the order, and the writer got his liberty.
</p>
<p>It must not be inferred from this, however, that the President was a de-
</p>
<p>votee to I'terature. He had no professional enthusiasm for it. The liter-
</p>
<p>ary coterie of the Whiw; House got little flattery but its members were
</p>
<p>treated as agreeable citizens and not as the architects of any body's for-
</p>
<p>tune.
</p>
<p>Willis went there much for awhile, but yielded to his old habit of gos-
</p>
<p>siping about the hall paper and the teapots. Emerson went there once,
</p>
<p>and w:is deferred to us if ho were anything but a phifosopher. Yet he sO'
</p>
<p>fer grasped the character of his host as to indite that noble humanitarian
</p>
<p>eulogy upon him, delivered at Concord, and printed in the Wobld. U
</p>
<p>The Martyr. 61
</p>
<p>will not do to say definitely in this notice how several occasional writers
</p>
<p>visited the White House, heard the President's views and assented to theni,
</p>
<p>and afterward abused him. But these attained no remembrance nor tart
</p>
<p>reproach from that least retaliatory of men. He harbored no malice, and
</p>
<p>is said to have often placed himself on the stand-point of Davis and Lee,
</p>
<p>and accounted for their defection while he could not excuse it.
</p>
<p>He was a good reader, and took all the leading New-York dailies every
</p>
<p>day. His secretaries perused them and selected all the items which would
</p>
<p>interest the President; these were read to him and considered. He bought
</p>
<p>few new books, but seemed ever alive to works of comic value; the vein
</p>
<p>of humor in him was not boisterous in its manifestations, but touched the
</p>
<p>geniality of his nature, and he reproduced all that he absorbed, to elucidate
</p>
<p>Bome new issue, or turn away argument by a laugh.
</p>
<p>As a jester, Mr. Lincoln's tendency was caricatured by the prints, but
</p>
<p>not exaggerated. He probably told as many stories as are attributed to
</p>
<p>him. Nor did he, as is averred, indulge in these jests on solemn occasions.
</p>
<p>No man felt with such personal intensity the extent of the casualities of
</p>
<p>his time, and he often gravely reasoned whether he could be in any way
</p>
<p>responsible for the bloodshed and devastation over which it was his duty
</p>
<p>to preside.
</p>
<p>An acquaintance of mine  a private  once went to him to plead for a
</p>
<p>man's life. He had never seen the man for whom he pleaded, and had no
</p>
<p>acquaintance with the man's family. Mr. Lincoln was touched by his dis-
</p>
<p>interestedness, and said to him :
</p>
<p>" U 1 were anything but the President, I would be constantly working
</p>
<p>as vou have done."
</p>
<p>Whenever a doubt of one's guilt lay on his mind, the man was spared
</p>
<p>by his direct interference.
</p>
<p>There was an entire absence in the President's character of the heroic ele-
</p>
<p>ment. He would do a great deed in deshabille as promptly as in full dress.
</p>
<p>He never aimed to be brilliant, unconsciously understanding that a great
</p>
<p>man's brilliancy is to be measured by the "wholeness" and synthetic cast
</p>
<p>of his career rather than by any fitful ebullitions. For that reason we look
</p>
<p>in vain through his messages for "points." His point was not to turn a sen-

<p>tence or an epigram, but to win an effect, regradless of the route to it.
</p>
<p>He was- coinmonplace in his talk, and Chesterfield would have had no
</p>
<p>patience with him ; his dignity of character lay in his uprightness rather
</p>
<p>than in his formal manner. Members of his government often reviewed
</p>
<p>him plainly in his presence. Yet he divined the true course, while they
</p>
<p>only argued it out.
</p>
<p>His good feeling was not only personal, but national. He had no pre-
</p>
<p>judice against any race or potentate. And his democracy was of a pi-acti-
</p>
<p>cal, rather than of a demonstrative, nature. He was not Marat, but Mo-
</p>
<p>reau  not Paine and Jefferson, but Franklin.
</p>
<p>His domestic life was like a parlor of night-time, lit by the equal grate
</p>
<p>of his genial and uniform kindness. Young Thaddy played with him
</p>
<p>upon the carpet ; Robert came home from the war and talked to his
</p>
<p>father as to a school-mate, he was to Mrs. Lincoln as chivalrous on the
</p>
<p>last day of his life as when he courted her. I have somewhere seen a
</p>
<p>picture of Henry IV. of France, riding his babies on his back : that was
</p>
<p>the President.
</p>
<p>So dwelt the citizen who is gone  a model in character if not in cere
</p>
<p>mony, for good men to come who will take his place in the same White

<p>House, and find their generation comparing them to the man thought

</p>
<p>worthy of assassination. I am glad to sit here in his chair, where he has
</p>
<p>bent so often,  in the atmosphere of the household he purified, in the
</p>
<p>sight of the green grass and the blue river he hallowed by gazing upon, in
</p>
<p>the very centre of the nation he preserved for the people, and close the
</p>
<p>list of bloody deeds, of desperate fights of swift expiations, of renowned
</p>
<p>obsequies of which I have written, by inditing at his table the goodness
</p>
<p>of his life and the eternity of his memory.
</p>
<p>LETTER VIII.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAIi.
</p>
<p>"Washington, May 26.
</p>
<p>The most exciting trial of our times has obtained a very meager com-
</p>
<p>memoration in all but its literal features. The evidence adduced in the
</p>
<p>course of it. has been too faithfully reported, through its far-fetched and
</p>
<p>monotonous irregularities, but nobody realizes the extraordinary scene
</p>
<p>from which so many columns emanate, either by aid of the reporters'
</p>
<p>scanty descriptions, or by the purblind sketches of the artists.
</p>
<p>Now that the evidence is growing vapid, and the obstinacy of the mili-
</p>
<p>tary commission has lost its coarse zest, we may find enough readers to
</p>
<p>warrant a fuller sketch of the conspirators' prison.
</p>
<p>About a mile below Washington, where the high Potomac Blufis meet
</p>
<p>the marshy border of the Eastern branch, stands the United States arsenal,
</p>
<p>a series of long, mathematically uninteresting brick buildings, with a
</p>
<p>broad lawn behind them, open to t-he water, and level military plazas, on
</p>
<p>-which are piled pyramids of shell and ball, among acres of cannon ana
</p>
<p>cannon-carriages, and caissons. A high wall, reaching circularly around
</p>
<p>these buildings, shows above it, as one looks from Washington, the barred
</p>
<p>windows of an older and more gloomy structure than the rest, which
</p>
<p>forms the city front of the group of which it is the principal. This was a
</p>
<p>penitentiary, but, long ago added to the arsenal, it has been re-transform-
</p>
<p>ed to a court-room and jail, and in its third, or uppermost story, the Milita-
</p>
<p>ry Commission is sitting.
</p>
<p>The main road to the arsenal is by a wide and vacant avenue, which
</p>
<p>abuts against a gate where automaton sentries walk, but the same gate can
</p>
<p>best be reached on foot by the shores of the Potomac, in the sight of the

</p>
<p>forts, the shipping, and Alexandria.
</p>
<p>The scene at the arsenal in time of peace is common-place enough, ex-
</p>
<p>cept that across the Eastern Branch the towers of the lunatic asylum,
</p>
<p>perched upon a height, look down baronially ; but this trial of murderers
</p>
<p>has made the spot a fair.
</p>
<p>A whole company of volunteers keeps the gate, through which are pass-
</p>
<p>ing cabs, barouches, officers' ambulances, and a stream of folks on foot;
</p>
<p>while farther along almost a regiment crosses the drive, their huddled shel-
</p>
<p>ter tents extending entirely across the peninsula. These are playing cards
</p>
<p>on the ground, and tossing quoits, and sleeping on their faces, while a gun-
</p>
<p>boat watches the river front, and under a circular wall a line of patrols, ten
</p>
<p>yards apart, go to and fro perpetually.
</p>
<p>It is 10 o'clock, and the court is soon to sit. Its members ride down in
</p>
<p>8perb ambulances and bring their friends along to show them the maje.ty

<p>The Trial. 63
</p>
<p>of justice. A perfect park of carriages stands by the door to the left, and
</p>
<p>from these dismount major-generals' wives, in rustling silks ; daughters of
</p>
<p>congressmen, attired like the lilies of the milliner ; little girls Mho hope to
</p>
<p>be young ladies and have come with " Pa," to look at the assassins ; even
</p>
<p>brides are here, in the fresh blush of their nuptials, and they consider the
</p>
<p>late spectacle of the review as good as lost, if the court-scene be not added
</p>
<p>to it. These tender creatures have a weakness for the ring of manacles,
</p>
<p>the sight of folks to be suspended in the air, the face of a woman confede-
</p>
<p>rate in blood.
</p>
<p>They chat with their polite guides, many of whom are gallant captains,
</p>
<p>and go one after another up the little flight of steps which leads to the
</p>
<p>room of the officer of the day.
</p>
<p>He passes them, if he pleases, up the crooked stairways, and when they
</p>
<p>have climbed three of these, they enter a sort of garret-room, oblong, and
</p>
<p>plastered white, and about as large as an ordinary town-house parlor.
</p>
<p>Four doors open into it  that by which we have entered, two from the
</p>
<p>left, where the witnesses wait, and one at the end, near the left far corner,
</p>
<p>"which is the outlet from the cells.
</p>
<p>A railing, close up to the stairway door, gives a little space in the fore-
</p>
<p>ground for witnesses ; two tables, transverse to this rail, are for the com-
</p>
<p>mission and the press, the first-named being to the right ; between these
</p>
<p>are a raised platform and pivot arm-chair for the witness ; below are the'
</p>
<p>sworn phonographers and the counsel for the accused, and then another
</p>
<p>rail like that seperating the crowd from the court, holds behind it the.
</p>
<p>accused and their guards.
</p>
<p>These are they who are living not by years nor by weeks, but by breaths.
</p>
<p>They are motley enough, for the most part, sitting upon a long bench with
</p>
<p>their backs against the wall,  ill-shaved, haggard, anxious, and the dungeon
</p>
<p>door at their left opens now and then to show behind it a moving bayonet.
</p>
<p>There are women within the court proper, edging upon the reporters, intro-
</p>
<p>duced there by a fussy usher, and through four windows filters the imper-
</p>
<p>fect daylight, making all things distinguishable,' yet shadowy. The coup
</p>
<p>d'ceil of this small and crowded scene is lively as a popular funeral.

<p>ing at Judge Holt. The gilt stars, bars, and orange-colored sashes of the
</p>
<p>commission ; the women's brilliant silks and bonnets ; the crowding spec-
</p>
<p>tators, with their brains in their eyes ; the blue coats of the guards ; the
</p>
<p>working scribes; and last of all the line of culprits, whose suspected guilt
</p>
<p>has made them worthy of all illustration.
</p>
<p>Between the angle of the wall and the studded door, under the heavy bar
</p>
<p>of dressed stone which marks above the thickness of the gaol, sits all alone
</p>
<p>a woman's figure, clothed in solemn black. Her shadowy skirt hides her
</p>
<p>feet, so that we cannot see whether they are riveted; her sleeves of sable
</p>
<p>sweep down to her wrist, and dark gloves cover the plumpness of her hand,
</p>
<p>while a palm-leaf fan nods to and fro to assist the obscurity of her vail of
</p>
<p>crape, descending from her widow's bonnet.
</p>
<p>A solitai-y woman, beginning the line of coarse indicted men, shrinking
</p>
<p>beneath the scornful eyes of her sex, and the as bold survey of men more
</p>
<p>pitiful, may well excite, despite her guilt, a moment of sympathy.
</p>
<p>Let men remember that she is the mother of a son who has fled to save
</p>
<p>his forfeit life by deserting her to shame, and perhaps, to death. Let wo-
</p>
<p>men, who will not mention her in mercy, learn from her end, in all suc-
</p>
<p>ceeding wars, to make patriotism of their household duties and not incite
</p>
<p>to blood.

</p>
<p>64 The Life, Crime, and Capture of John Wilkes Booth.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Surratt is a graduate of that seminary which spits in soldiers' faces,
</p>
<p>denounces brave generals upon the rostrum, and cries out for an intermi-
</p>
<p>nable scaftold when all the bells are ringing peace.
</p>
<p>How far her wicked love influenced her to participation in the murder
</p>
<p>rests in her uwn breast, and up to this time she has not differed from mo-
</p>
<p>thers at large  to twist her own bow-string rather than build his gibbet.
</p>
<p>Beneath her shadowy bonnet, over her fan-tip, we see two large, sad
</p>
<p>eyes, rising and falling, and now and then when the fan sways to and fro,
</p>
<p>the hair just turning gray with trouble, and the round face growing wan
</p>
<p>and seamed with terrible reflection, are seen a moment crouching low, as if
</p>
<p>she would wish to grovel upon the floor and bury her forehead in her
</p>
<p>hands. -"^
</p>
<p>Yet, sometimes, across Mrs. Surratt's face a stealthiness creeps  a sort
</p>
<p>of furtive, feline flashing of the eye, like that of one which means to leap
</p>
<p>sideways. At these times her face seems to grow hard and colorless, as if
</p>
<p>that tiger expression which Pradier caught upon the face of BrinviUiers and
</p>
<p>fastened into a masque, had been repeated here. Not to grow mawkish
</p>
<p>while we must be kind, let us not forget that this woman is an old plotter.
</p>
<p>If she did not devise the assassination, she was privy to it long. She was
</p>
<p>an agent of contraband mails  a bold, crafty, assured rebel  perhaps a spy
</p>
<p> and in the event of her condemnation, let those who would plead for her
</p>
<p>spend half their pity upon that victim whose heart was like a woman's,
</p>
<p>and whose hand was merciful as a mother's.
</p>
<p>Before the door sits an officer, uncovered, who does not seem to labor
</p>
<p>under any particular fear, chiefly because the captives are ironed to immova
</p>
<p>bility, and he stares and smiles alternately, as if he were somewhat amiable
</p>
<p>and extremely bored.
</p>
<p>Next to the officer is a shabby-looking boy, whose seat is by the right
</p>
<p>jamb of the jail door. Of all boys just old enough to feel their oats, this
</p>
<p>boy is the most commonplace His parents would be likely lo have no
</p>
<p>sanguine hopes of his reaching the presidency; for his head indicates latent
</p>
<p>dementia, and a slice ,or two from it would recommend him, without ex
</p>
<p>amination, to the school for the feeble-minded. Better dressed, and washed,
</p>
<p>and shaved, he might make a tolerable adornment to a hotel door, or even

</p>
<p>reach the dignity of a bar-keeper or an usher at a theatre. But that this
</p>
<p>fellow should occupy a leaf in history and be confounded with a tragedy
</p>
<p>entering into the literature of the world, reverses manifest destiny, and
</p>
<p>leaves neither phrenology nor physiognomy a place to stand upon.
</p>
<p>Come up ! Gall, Spurzheim, and Lavater, and remark his sallow face,
</p>
<p>attenuated by base excesses ! Do you know any forehead so broad which
</p>
<p>means so little ? the oyster could teach this man philosophy ! His chin is
</p>
<p>sharp, his eyes are blank blue, his short black hair curls over his ears, and
</p>
<p>his beard is of a prickly black, with a moustache which does not help his
</p>
<p>general contemptibleness. A dirty grayish shirt without a linen coUa'', is
</p>
<p>seen between the lapels of the greasy and dusty cloth coat, sloping at the
</p>
<p>shoulders ; and under his worn brown trowsers, the manacle of iron makes
</p>
<p>an ugly garter to his carpet slipper.
</p>
<p>This is David Harold, who shared the wild night-ride of Booth, and
</p>
<p>barely escaped that outlaw's death in the burning barn.
</p>
<p>He stoops to the rail of the dock, now and then, to chat with his attorney,
</p>
<p>an5 a sort of blank anxiety which he wears, as his head turns here and
</p>
<p>there, sliifts to a frolicking smile. But a woman of unusual attractions
</p>
<p>enters the court, and Harold is much more interested in her than in his
</p>
<p>acquittal.
</p>
<p>The Trial. 66
</p>
<p>Great Caesar's dust, which stopped a knot-hole, has in this play boy an
</p>
<p>inverse parallel. He was at best hostler to a murderer, and tailed in that.
</p>
<p>His chief concern at present is to have somebody to talk to; and he thinks,
</p>
<p>upon the whole, that if an assassination is productive of so little fun, he will
</p>
<p>have nothing to do with another one.
</p>
<p>That Harold has slipped into history gives us as much surprise as that
</p>
<p>he has yet to sutler death gives us almost contempt for the scaffold. But
</p>
<p>if the scaffold must wait for only wise men to get upon it, it must rot.
</p>
<p>Your wise man does no murder in the first place, and if so, in the second,
</p>
<p>he dodges the penalty. In this 'v^rld, Harold, idiotcy is oftener punished
</p>
<p>than guilt.
</p>
<p>That Booth should have used Harold is very naturally accounted for.
</p>
<p>Actors live only to be admired ; vanity rises to its climax in them. Booth
</p>
<p>preferred this sparrow to sing him peans rather than live by an eagle and
</p>
<p>be screamed at now and then.
</p>
<p>At the right hand side of Harold sits a soldier in blue, who is evidently
</p>
<p>thinking about a game of quoits with his comrades in the jail yard ; he won-
</p>
<p>ders why lawyers are so very dry, and is surprised to find a trial for mur-
</p>
<p>der as tedious as a thanksgiving sermon.
</p>
<p>But on the soldier's other hand is a figure which makes the center and
</p>
<p>cynosure of this thrilling scene. Taller by a whole head than either his
</p>
<p>companions or the sentries, Payne, the assassin, sits erect, and flings his
</p>
<p>barbarian eye to and fro, radiating the tremendous energy of his colossal
</p>
<p>physique.
</p>
<p>He is the only man worthy to have murdered Mr. Seward. When
</p>
<p>against the delicate organization, the fine, subtle, nervous mind of the Sec-
</p>
<p>retary of State, this giant, knife in hand, precipitated himself, two forms of
</p>
<p>civilization met as distinctly as when the savage Gauls invaded the Roman
</p>
<p>senate.
</p>
<p>Lawlessness and intelligence, the saVage and the statesman, body and
</p>
<p>mind, fought together upon. Mr. Seward's bed.
</p>
<p>The mystery attending Payne's home and parentage still exists to make
</p>
<p>him more incomprehensible. Out of the vague, dim ultima thule,
</p>
<p>like those Asiatic hordes which came from nowhere and shivered civilization,

</p>
<p>Payne suddenly appeared and fought his way to the sanctum sanctorum of
</p>
<p>law. I think his part in the assassination more remarkable than Booth's.
</p>
<p>The latter's crime was shrewdly plotted, as by one measuring intelligence
</p>
<p>with the whole government. But Payne did not think  he only
</p>
<p>struck !
</p>
<p>With this man's face before me as I write, lam reminded of some Maori
</p>
<p>chief waging war from the lust of blood or the pride of local dominion.
</p>
<p>His complexion is bloodless, yet so healthy that a passing observer would
</p>
<p>afterward speak of it as ruddy. His face is broad, with a character nose,
</p>
<p>sensual lips, and very high cheek bones ; the cranium is full and the brow
</p>
<p>speaking, while the head runs back to an abnormal apex at the tip of the
</p>
<p>cerebellum. His straight, lusterless black hair, duly parted, is at the sum-
</p>
<p>mit so disturbed that tufts of it rise up like Red Jacket's or Tecumseh's ;
</p>
<p>but the head is kept well up, and rests upon a wonderfully broad throst,
</p>
<p>muscular as one's thigh, and without any trace, as he sits, of the protuber-
</p>
<p>ance called Adam's apple. Withal, the eye is thd man Payne's, power. It
</p>
<p>is dark and speechless^ and rolls here and there like that of a beast in a cage
</p>
<p>which strives in vain to understand the language of its captors. . It seems
</p>
<p>to say, if anything, that it has no sympathy with anybody approximate,
</p>
<p>and has submitted, like a lion bound, to the logic of conviction and of cU'tins.

<p>66 The Life, Crime, and Capture of John Wilkes Booth.
</p>
<p>Payne looks at none of his fellow-prisoners : assassins caujjht seldom cares
</p>
<p>to recognise each other ; for while there is faithfulness among thieves, there
</p>
<p>is none among murderers. His great white eyeball never roves to any-
</p>
<p>body's in the dock, nor theirs to his. He has confessed his crime and they
</p>
<p>know it; so they have no mutual hope ; thoy listen tu the evidence because
</p>
<p>it concerns them ; he looks at it only, because it cannot save him. He is
</p>
<p>entirely beardless, yet in his boyish chin more of a man physically than
</p>
<p>the rest, combined.
</p>
<p>While I watch this man I am constantly repeating to myself that stanza
</p>
<p>of Bryant's :
</p>
<p>" Upon the market place he stood, 
</p>
<p>A man of giant frame,
</p>
<p>Amid the gatherine; multitude
</p>
<p>That shrunk to hear his name ;
</p>
<p>All proud of step and firm of limb.
</p>
<p>His dark eye on the ground 
</p>
<p>And silently they gazed on him,
</p>
<p>As on a lion bound."
</p>
<p>His dress, which we scarcely notice in the grander contrast of his pose
</p>
<p>and stature, is an old shirt of woolen blue, with a white nap at the button-
</p>
<p>holes, and upon his knees of black cloth he twirls, as if for relaxation, be-
</p>
<p>bWeen his powerful manacles, a soiled white handkerchief  if from his
</p>
<p>mother, we conjecture, a gift to a bloodhound from his dam. His heavy
</p>
<p>handcuffs make his broad shoulders more narrow. Yet we can see by the
</p>
<p>outline of the sleeves what girth the muscles has, and the hand at the end
</p>
<p>of his long and bony arm is wide and huge, as if it could wield a clay-
</p>
<p>more as well as a dirk. He also wears carpet slippers, but his ankles are
</p>
<p>clogged with so heavy irons that two men must carry them when he enters
</p>
<p>or leaves the dock. For this man there can be no sentiment  no more
</p>
<p>than for a bull. The flesh on his face is hard, as if cast, rather than gener-
</p>
<p>ated, and while we see how he towers above the entire court, we watch
</p>
<p>him in wonder, as if he were some maniac denizen of a zone where men
</p>
<p>without minds grow to the stature and power of fiends.
</p>
<p>The face of Payne is not of the traditional southern peculiarities. He

</p>
<p>resembles rather a Pennsylvania mountaineer than a Kentucky rustic.
</p>
<p>Three weeks ago 1 gave, in an account of the conspiracy which many
</p>
<p>gainsayed, but which the trial has fully confirmed, a sketch of this man, to
</p>
<p>which 1 still adhere. He was furnished to Booth and John Surratt from
</p>
<p>Canada; sent upon special service with his life in his hands ; and he faced
</p>
<p>the murder he was to commit like any prize-fighter. I pity Beall, who died
</p>
<p>intelligently for a wretched essay against civilians, that his biography and
</p>
<p>fate must be matched by this savage's !
</p>
<p>Next to Payne, and crouching under him like a frog under a rock, is an
</p>
<p>inconsiderable soldier, who chews his cud, and would cheerfully hang his
</p>
<p>protege for the sake of being rid of him. My sympathies are entirely en-
</p>
<p>listed for this soldier ; he has neither the joy of being acquitted, nor the
</p>
<p>excitement of being tried. He is quite a sizable man by himself, but
</p>
<p>Payne overhangs him, and the dullness of the trial quite stultifies him.
</p>
<p>The few points of law which are admitted here are not so evident to this
</p>
<p>soldier as the point of his bayonet. I see what ails him.
</p>
<p>He wants to swear.
</p>
<p>A beam running overhead divides the court lengthwise in half, and as tht
</p>
<p>prisoners sit at the end of the court, the German Atzerolt, or Adzeroth,
</p>
<p>has a place just beneath the beam. This is very ominous for Atzerott.
</p>
<p>The Trial. 67
</p>
<p>The filthiness of this man denies him sympathy. He is a disnjusting little
</p>
<p>groveler, of dry, sandy hair, oval head, ears set so dose to the chin that
</p>
<p>one would think his sense of hearing limited to his jaws, and a complexion
</p>
<p>so yellow that the uncropped brownness of his beard does not materially
</p>
<p>darken it. He wears a grayish coat, low grimy shirt, and the usual carpet
</p>
<p>slippers of threadbare red over his shifting and shiftless feet. His bond ia
</p>
<p>bent forward, and seems to be anxiously trying to catch the tenor of the
</p>
<p>trial. Many persons outside of the court, Atzerott, are equally puzzled !
</p>
<p>From as much examination of this man as his insignificance permits, I
</p>
<p>should call him a " gabby" fellow  loud of resolution, ignoble of effort.
</p>
<p>Over his lager no man would be braver. His face is familiar to me from
</p>
<p>a review of those detective cabinets usually called " Rogues' Galleries." As
</p>
<p>a "sneak thief" or "bagman," I should convict him by his face; the same
</p>
<p>indictment would make me acquit him instantly of assassination. In this
</p>
<p>estimate I rely upon evidence as well as upon appearance. Atzerott
</p>
<p>swaggered about Kirkwood's Hotel asking for the Vice-President's room ;
</p>
<p>Payne or Booth would have done the murder silently. Nobody pities a
</p>
<p>dirty man. The same arts of dress and cleanliness which please ladies
</p>
<p>influence juries.
</p>
<p>Next to Atzerott sits a soldier  a very jolly and smooth faced soldier 
</p>
<p>who at one time hears a witness say something laughable. The soldier
</p>
<p>immediately grins to the farthest point of his scalp. But he is chagrined
</p>
<p>to find that the joke is too trivial to admit of a laugh of duration. Very
</p>
<p>few jokes before the present court do so. But this soldier being of long
</p>
<p>charity and excellent patience, awaits the next joke like a veteran under
</p>
<p>orders, and reposes his chin upon the dock as if aware that between jokes
</p>
<p>there was ample time for a nap.
</p>
<p>The next prisoner to the right is O'Laughlin. He is a small man, about
</p>
<p>twenty-eight years of age, attired in a fine, soiled coat, but without white
</p>
<p>linen upon either his bosom or neck, and handcufl^s rest hugely upon his
</p>
<p>mediocrity. His moustache, eye-brows, and hair are regular and very
</p>
<p>black. He does not look unlike Booth, though he seems to have little
</p>
<p>bodily power, and he is very anxious, as if more earnest than any of the
</p>
<p>rest, to have a fair lease upon life. His countenance is not prppossessing,

</p>
<p>though he might be considered passably good looking in a mixed company.
</p>
<p>Between O'Laughlin and the next prisoner, Spangler, sits a soldier in
</p>
<p>ultramarine  a discontented soldier, a moody, dissatisfied, and arbitrary
</p>
<p>soldier. His definition of military justice is like the boy's answer at school
</p>
<p>to the familiar question upon the Constitution of the United States :
</p>
<p>" What rights do accused persons enjoy ?"
</p>
<p>The boy wrote out, very carefully, this answer :
</p>
<p>" Death by hanging."
</p>
<p>The boy would have been correct had the question applied to accused
</p>
<p>persons before a court-martial. ^
</p>
<p>Spangler, the scene-shifter and stage-carpenter, has the face and bearing
</p>
<p>of a day-laborer. His blue woollen shirt does not confuse him, as he is (
</p>
<p>used to it. He has an oldish face, wrinkled by fearful anticipations, and
</p>
<p>his hair is thin. He is awkwardly built, and watches the trial earnestly, as
</p>
<p>if striving to catch between the links of evidence vistas of a life insured.
</p>
<p>This man has a simple and pleading face, and there is something genial in
</p>
<p>his great, incoherent countenance. He is said to have cleared the stage for
</p>
<p>Booth's escape, but this is indifferently testified to. He had often been
</p>
<p>asked bv Booth to take a drink at the nearest bar. Persons who drink
</p>
<p>68 The Life, Crime, and Capture of John Wilkes Booth.
</p>
<p>assure me that the greatest mark of confidence which a great man can show
</p>
<p>a lesser one is to make that tender ; this, therefore, explains Booth's power
</p>
<p>over Spangler.
</p>
<p>Spangler is the first scene-shifter who may become a dramatis personae,
</p>
<p>A soldier sits between Spangler and Doctor Mudd. The soldier would
</p>
<p>like Spangler to get up and go away, so that he could have as much of the
</p>
<p>bench as he might sleep upon. This particular soldier, I may be qualified
</p>
<p>to say, would sleep upon his post.
</p>
<p>Doctor Mudd has a New England and not a Maryland face. He com-
</p>
<p>pares, to those on his left, as Hyperion to a squatter, llis high, oval head
</p>
<p>is bald very far up, but not benevolently so, and it is covered with light
</p>
<p>red hair, so thin as to contrast indifl'erently with the denseness of his beard
</p>
<p>and goatee. His nose would be insignificant but for its sharpness, and at
</p>
<p>the nostrils it is swelling and high-spirited. His eyes impinge upon his
</p>
<p>brows, and they are shining and rather dark, while the brows themselves
</p>
<p>are so scantily  clothed with hair that they seem quite naked. Mudd is
</p>
<p>neatly dressed in a green-grass duster, and white bosom and collar ; if he
</p>
<p>had no other advantages over his associates these last would give it to him.
</p>
<p>He keeps his feet upon the rail before him in true republican style, and
</p>
<p>rolls a morsel of tobacco under his tongue.
</p>
<p>The military commission works as if it were delegated not to try, but
</p>
<p>to convict, and Dr. Mudd, if he be innocent, is in only less danger than if
</p>
<p>he were guilty. He has a sort of home-bred intelligence in his face, and
</p>
<p>socially is as far above his fellows as Goliah of Gath above the rest of the
</p>
<p>Philistines.
</p>
<p>On the right of Doctor Mudd sits a soldier, who is striving to looK
</p>
<p>through his leg's at the iudse-advocate, as if taking a sort of secret aim at
</p>
<p>that person, with the intent to fetch him down, because he makes the trial
</p>
<p>so very dry, and the soldier so very thirsty.
</p>
<p>The last man, who sits on the extreme right of the prisoners, is Mr.
</p>
<p>Sam. Arnold. He is, perhaps, the best looking of the prisoners, and the
</p>
<p>least implicated. He has a solid, pleasant face ; has been a rebel soldier,
</p>
<p>foolishly committed himself to Booth, with perhaps no intention to do a
</p>
<p>crime, recanted in pen and ink, and was made a national character. Had

</p>
<p>he recanted by word of mouth he might have saved himself unpleasant
</p>
<p>dreams. This shows everybody the absurdity of writing what they can so
</p>
<p>easily say. The best thing Arnold ever wrote was his letter to Booth refu-
</p>
<p>sing to engage in murder. Yet this recantation is more la evidence against
</p>
<p>him than his original purpose.
</p>
<p>Arnold looks out of the window, and feels easy.
</p>
<p>The reporters who are present are generally young fellows, practical and
</p>
<p>ardent, like Woods, of Boston ; Colburn, of The World; and Major
</p>
<p>Poore, who has been the chronicler of such scenes for twenty years. Ber.
</p>
<p>Pitman, one of the authors of phonetic writing, is among the official re-
</p>
<p>porters, and the ^furphies, who could report the lightning, if it could talk,
</p>
<p>are slashing down history as it passes in at their ears and runs out at their
</p>
<p>fingers' ends.
</p>
<p>The counsel for the accused strike me as being commonplace lawyers.
</p>
<p>They either have no chance or no pluck to assert the dignity of their pro-
</p>
<p>fession. Reverdy Johnson is not here. The first day disgusted him, as
</p>
<p>he is a practitioner of laio. Yet the best word of the trial has been his .
</p>
<p>" I, gentlemen, am a member of that body of legislators which creates
</p>
<p>courts-martial and major-generals !"
</p>
<p>The Trial. 69
</p>
<p>The commission has collectively an imposing appearance : the face of
</p>
<p>Judge Holt is swarthy ; he questions with slow utterance, holding the
</p>
<p>witness in his cold, measuring eye. Hunter, who sits at the opposite end
</p>
<p>of the table, shuts his eyes now and then, either to sleep or think, or both,
</p>
<p>and the other generals take a note or two, and watch for occasions to dis-
</p>
<p>tinguish themselves.
</p>
<p>Excepting Judge Holt, the court has shown as little ability as could be
</p>
<p>expected from soldiers, placed in unenviable publicity, and upon a duty
</p>
<p>for which they are disqualified, both by education and acumen. Witness
</p>
<p>the lack of dignity in Hunter, who opened the court by a coarse allusion
</p>
<p>to " humbug chivalry;" of Lew. Wallace, whose heat and intolerance were
</p>
<p>appropriately urged in the most exceptional English ; of Howe, whose
</p>
<p>tirade against the rebel General Johnson was feeble as it was ungenerous !
</p>
<p>This court was needed to show us at least the petty tyranny of martial
</p>
<p>law and the pettiness of martial jurists. The counsel for the defense have
</p>
<p>iust enough show to make the unfairness of the trial partake of hypocrisy,
</p>
<p>iind the wideness of the subjects discussed makes one imagine that the
</p>
<p>object of the commission is to write a cyclopedia, and not to hang or ac-
</p>
<p>(j^uit six or eight miserable wretches.

</p>
<p>ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>The peaceful valleys reaching wide,
</p>
<p>The wild war stilled on everj hand ;
</p>
<p>On Pisgah's top our Prophet died,
</p>
<p>In si^ht of Promised Land.
</p>
<p>A cheerful heart he bore alway,
</p>
<p>Though tragio years clashed on the while ;
</p>
<p>Death sat behind him at the play 
</p>
<p>His last look was a smile.
</p>
<p>His single arm crushed wrong and thrall 
</p>
<p>That grand good will we only dreamed.
</p>
<p>Two races weep around his pall.
</p>
<p>One saved and one redeemed.
</p>
<p>No battle pike his march imbrued ;
</p>
<p>Unarmed he went 'midst martial mails.
</p>
<p>The footsore felt their strength renewed
</p>
<p>To hear his homely tales.
</p>
<p>The trampled flag he raised again,
</p>
<p>And healed our eagle's broken wing ;
</p>
<p>The night that scattered armed men
</p>
<p>Saw scorpions rise tp sting.
</p>
<p>Down fell the brand in treason's hand
</p>
<p>Its gashes as he strove to staunch.
</p>
<p>And o'er the waste of ruined land
</p>
<p>To take the Olive Branch.
</p>
<p>The holy crest by murder stained,
</p>
<p>Upon its shattered portal lie ;
</p>
<p>The text this bravo's lips profaned
</p>
<p>Be sanctified for aye !
</p>
<p>In still green field or belfried kirk,
</p>
<p>Where'er high boughs his sleep may lull,
</p>
<p>Here closed his life, where closed his work.
</p>
<p>Beside the Capitol.
</p>
<p>Be his no tomb perturbed and pent,
</p>
<p>With words too weak for grief begilt,

<p>Reasons why " Tlie American Hoyle" mast be tUo Standard Antbiority for
</p>
<p>All Ganics played in tUe United States : Bccanse
</p>
<p>It is an American Book, prepared with great care,
</p>
<p>with the aid an'd Cuunsel of a large number of the
</p>
<p>best players (both amateur and professional) id this
</p>
<p>country.
</p>
<p>The Kules, descriptions, definitions and technical-
</p>
<p>ities are all simplitted and adapted to the several
</p>
<p>games as they are actually pl;iyed here.
</p>
<p>Many of our games are peculiarly American, and
</p>
<p>cannot be intelligibly described except by an Amer-
</p>
<p>ican who understands them, while those of foreign
</p>
<p>origin have become so changed ly American modi-
</p>
<p>fications, as to make the European rules and descrip-
</p>
<p>tions as likely to mislead as to instruct.
</p>
<p>In preparing this work the best or greatest weight
</p>
<p>of authority for each particular game has been taken
</p>
<p>upon disputed points.
</p>
<p>All the pames played in the ITnited States, whether
</p>
<p>ct home or foreign origin, are given as they are
</p>
<p>played by Americans at tlie pi eseiit day.
</p>
<p>No complete woik on the popular games of this
</p>
<p>ountry, exhibiting them as they are actually played
</p>
<p>here, has ever been published, until "The American
</p>
<p>Hoyle" appeared.
</p>
<p>The important games of Chess, Draughts and Back-
</p>
<p>gammon are illustrated with over 130 diagrams of
</p>
<p>games, problems and criticiil positions, all of which

<p>have been carefully played upon the board since the
</p>
<p>work was stereotyped, and nearly 100 errors (which
</p>
<p>appear in English game books and their American
</p>
<p>reprints) have been coirected.
</p>
<p>The game of Kussian Bac kgammon, one of the
</p>
<p>most pleasing fireside games, and which has been
</p>
<p>much sought after, has never been published in any
</p>
<p>book of games, until the editor of "The American
</p>
<p>Hoyle" gave it to the public in tliat work.
</p>
<p>Faro as it is presented in foreign game books,
</p>
<p>and as it really is in the United States, as preented
</p>
<p>in "The American Hoyle," are two entirely distinct
</p>
<p>things, and no one can understand it or play it safely
</p>
<p>unless he has the American authority to refer to.
</p>
<p>Euchre and Bezique are both popular gamss,
</p>
<p>and both occupy the extended space which their
</p>
<p>importance deserves  this is deemed essential to
</p>
<p>the settlement of the many disputed points that
</p>
<p>have from time to time arisen in relation to both
</p>
<p>games.
</p>
<p>The important game of Boston, as played in the
</p>
<p>United States, is now given for the first time in any
</p>
<p>book of games.
</p>
<p>The many disputed points in the games of All-
</p>
<p>Fours, Poker, Pitch, Loo, and Vingt-Un, are all
</p>
<p>enlarged upon, and careful and accurate deciioni
</p>
<p>are given.
</p>
<p>The treatise on Billiards and Pool is by Minhael
</p>
<p>Phelan, who is too well known to need further
</p>
<p>mention here.
</p>
<p>If you study the "Doctrine of Chances," as pre-
</p>
<p>sented in " The American Hoyle," you will be much
</p>
<p>less likely to come out second best in a game than
</p>
<p>if you " go ilk blind."
