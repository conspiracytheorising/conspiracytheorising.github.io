<p>PREFACE
</p>
<p>During the years 1904 and 1905 the
</p>
<p>writer was brought into frequent contact
</p>
<p>with German officials and into professional
</p>
<p>relations with German courts, particularly
</p>
<p>the German consular courts of China.
</p>
<p>It was during this period that the Chi-
</p>
<p>nese government was pressing its demands
</p>
<p>for a relaxation of tjie laws excluding its
</p>
<p>subjects from the United States. Its efforts
</p>
<p>in this direction gathered popular support in
</p>
<p>all parts of the Empire  a strange circum-
</p>
<p>stance in view of the traditional apathy
</p>
<p>toward public policies which the Chinese, un-
</p>
<p>til then, had maintained. But on this ques-
</p>
<p>tion the entire nation became aroused. Be-
</p>
<p>fore long, walls were plastered with posters
</p>
<p>demanding a boycott of American goods,
</p>
<p>and circulars urging this retaliatory meas-
</p>
<p>ure were passed from hand to hand. Goods

</p>
<p>spotted and labelled, and then left to lie un-
</p>
<p>called for in the godowns.
</p>
<p>During a visit to Tsingtau, the capital of
</p>
<p>the German Kiaochow Protectorate, the
</p>
<p>writer had occasion to go through the print-
</p>
<p>ing establishment maintained by the Ger-
</p>
<p>man government for its official publications.
</p>
<p>There, to his astonishment, he found the
</p>
<p>presses busy turning out boycott literature.
</p>
<p>In the meantime German merchants were
</p>
<p>taking advantage of the embarrassment of
</p>
<p>American trade to introduce their substi-
</p>
<p>tutes.
</p>
<p>This incident is characteristic. The tech-
</p>
<p>nique of German propaganda consists in
</p>
<p>seeking out the differences to which race, re-
</p>
<p>ligion, language, industrial or economic con-
</p>
<p>dition may give rise, in inflaming such dif-
</p>
<p>ferences into bitter animosities, and then in
</p>
<p>profiting either from the disintegration pro-
</p>
<p>duced within an opposing nation, or from the
</p>
<p>quarrels among political or commercial com-
</p>
<p>petitors.

<p>who have fought the war for freedom, will
</p>
<p>undoubtedly, in the future, furnish fresh op-
</p>
<p>portunities for German propaganda. Against
</p>
<p>this propaganda, and its resulting disintegra-
</p>
<p>tion and dissension, we must still stand
</p>
<p>guard.

<p>THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION
</p>
<p>A PART OF THE HIGHER STRATEGY
</p>
<p>Again and again during the past year there
</p>
<p>has been presented to the American public sen-
</p>
<p>sational evidence of the conspiracies set on
</p>
<p>foot in the United States by Germany's ac-
</p>
<p>credited diplomatic and consular officials as
</p>
<p>well as by her less conspicuous hirelings. The
</p>
<p>plots having for their object the dynamiting of
</p>
<p>the Welland Canal, the destruction of the Port
</p>
<p>Huron tunnel and of the Vanceboro bridge, the
</p>
<p>blowing up of factories in Detroit and other
</p>
<p>cities, the sinking of ships at sea by time bombs,
</p>
<p>the organisation of armed expeditions against
</p>
<p>Canada and India, the forging of American
</p>
<p>passports, the inciting of revolution in Ireland,

<p>10 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>the fomenting of strikes in American indus-
</p>
<p>tries and the corruption of American public
</p>
<p>opinion  all these have been laid bare in con-
</p>
<p>vincing detail. The history of diplomatic in-
</p>
<p>tercourse offers no parallel to these outrages
</p>
<p>upon our peace and security perpetrated by the
</p>
<p>representatives of a power which, at the time,
</p>
<p>was protesting the friendliest intentions.
</p>
<p>These plots, however, recede into the back-
</p>
<p>ground when viewed in relation to the far more
</p>
<p>dangerous and insidious conspiracy which Ger-
</p>
<p>many, through her agents, sympathisers and
</p>
<p>dupes, has prosecuted against American edu-
</p>
<p>cation. Bridges, canals, factories and ships
</p>
<p>are mere physical properties, easily replaced.
</p>
<p>Our public education, on the other hand, repre-
</p>
<p>sents infinitely higher values. In our schools
</p>
<p>are transmitted the traditions of the past ; there
</p>
<p>the ideals for the future are formulated ; there
</p>
<p>are generated those moral forces which bind
</p>
<p>us together and vitalise us as a nation. They
</p>
<p>are the repositories of our national spirit, and
</p>
<p>national spirit cannot be made to order. It is
</p>
<p>born of the travail of history, of the sacrifices
</p>
<p>of countless thousands in the past, of the work

</p>
<p>of those rare geniuses that flash upon a nation's
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 11
</p>
<p>horizon as infrequently and mysteriously as
</p>
<p>comets from an unknown stellar system. Once
</p>
<p>perverted or destroyed, it cannot be restored.
</p>
<p>With it, there succumbs the nation, and the
</p>
<p>nation's institutions and achievements pass into
</p>
<p>history. The plots engineered by Kaltschmidt,
</p>
<p>Koenig, von Igel, Consul General Bopp, von
</p>
<p>Papen, Boy-Ed, Ambassador Bernstorff and
</p>
<p>their retinue of lesser malefactors have fur-
</p>
<p>nished the press frequent opportunities for sen-
</p>
<p>sational headlines. But the activities of these
</p>
<p>men are insignificant when compared with the
</p>
<p>insidious and far-reaching conspiracy against
</p>
<p>our education.
</p>
<p>In a very practical sense our schools are the
</p>
<p>citadel of our national strength. Napoleon
</p>
<p>declared that in war the moral is to the physical
</p>
<p>as three to one. Neither numbers nor equip-
</p>
<p>ment can take the place of the moral qualities
</p>
<p>of determination and discipline. Prior to the
</p>
<p>French Revolution, the wars of Europe were
</p>
<p>waged by comparatively small armies, made up
</p>
<p>of professional soldiers and hired mercenaries.
</p>
<p>The paltry thousands commanded by Marl-
</p>
<p>borough, Prince Eugene, Wallenstein and

<p>Frederick the Great could be welded into fairly
</p>
<p>12 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>intelligent and effective unity by the will and
</p>
<p>prestige of a great commander. The profes-
</p>
<p>sional soldier was stimulated by the same de-
</p>
<p>sires for reward and success that inspire the
</p>
<p>efforts of men in every other occupation; the
</p>
<p>mercenary was incited by the lust for booty.
</p>
<p>But with the development of the nationalistic
</p>
<p>state, the art of warfare passed into a new
</p>
<p>stage. To-day wars are waged by nations, by
</p>
<p>entire races. The professional soldier and the
</p>
<p>mercenary have disappeared. It is no longer
</p>
<p>the will of a great commander, the prestige of
</p>
<p>a successful general, motives of self-interest
</p>
<p>or of professional pride that furnish the moral
</p>
<p>factors for combat. The civilian who enters
</p>
<p>the ranks leaves behind him his private inter-
</p>
<p>ests, his volition, to a large extent his individ-
</p>
<p>uality. Their places are taken by the collec-
</p>
<p>tive interest and personality of the nation.
</p>
<p>The soldier becomes the embodiment of the
</p>
<p>national soul and through him the state finds
</p>
<p>expression. The morale of the soldier, there-
</p>
<p>fore, depends upon those traditions, views of
</p>
<p>life, and instincts, which he has acquired in
</p>
<p>common with the other members of his nation,

</p>
<p> those things which the state has imparted
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 13
</p>
<p>through collective education. As a recent mil-
</p>
<p>itary text-book expresses it:
</p>
<p>the spirit of good infantry is first of all
</p>
<p>given by the first moral education of the
</p>
<p>man; it may depend on an ideal ; on a fanati-
</p>
<p>cism ; it is a function of the public spirit of
</p>
<p>the mass of the population.
</p>
<p>Collective education given by society is
</p>
<p>the only means which will assure to the army
</p>
<p>the cohesion necessary to march to victory.
</p>
<p>The task must be assumed by the mass of the
</p>
<p>people  in the home, the school, the work-
</p>
<p>shop. The spirit of duty and discipline must
</p>
<p>be cultivated by the mass of the people or it
</p>
<p>will not exist in the depths of their being.
</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the Germans, though the
</p>
<p>latest to experience the effects of the movement
</p>
<p>towards national unity, have been the first to
</p>
<p>put into practice the change which it has neces-
</p>
<p>sitated in the military art.
</p>
<p>Germany's educational system was designed
</p>
<p>to meet the requirements, as she analysed
</p>
<p>them, of national wars and national armies.
</p>
<p>She adapted her schools to the respective roles
</p>
<p>which she intended the different elements of
</p>
<p>her population to play in the national scheme.

<p>The Volksschulen, often cited erroneously as
</p>
<p>U THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>corresponding to our public schools, were pro-
</p>
<p>vided for the great mass of the population.
</p>
<p>Here, between the ages of six and fourteen,
</p>
<p>they had instilled into their minds the precepts r
</p>
<p>of the divine sovereignty of the Kaiser, of the
</p>
<p>beneficence of this rule, and of obedience to au-
</p>
<p>thority. They were impressed with the im-
</p>
<p>mense advantages inherent in their form of
</p>
<p>government and with the superiority of their
</p>
<p>Kultur; they were told again and again that
</p>
<p>their advancement and prosperity had aroused
</p>
<p>the jealousy and hostility of neighbouring na-
</p>
<p>tions, and through constant iteration they were
</p>
<p>accustomed to regarding military preparation
</p>
<p>as necessary and war as inevitable. Day by
</p>
<p>day they were put through a mental goose-
</p>
<p>step until their minds were fashioned to a
</p>
<p>single pattern and they were made into docile
</p>
<p>and efficient subjects.
</p>
<p>These were the privates in Germany's mili-
</p>
<p>taristic organisation.
</p>
<p>For those who were to fill the lower admin-
</p>
<p>istrative ranks there were provided the Mittel-
</p>
<p>schulen. Finally, for those destined for com-
</p>
<p>mand, there were the Gymnasia, taking boys

</p>
<p>between the ages of nine and eighteen, and
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 15
</p>
<p>then the universities. Here Germany trained
</p>
<p>the oligarchy of thinkers and experts which
</p>
<p>prescribed what the rest of the population
</p>
<p>snould know and believe, and what their tasks
</p>
<p>should be. The line between the Volksschulen,
</p>
<p>on the one hand, and the Gymnasia and univer-
</p>
<p>sities on the other, was drawn as rigidly as
</p>
<p>that separating the enlisted personnel from
</p>
<p>the officers in the army.
</p>
<p>In this manner the minds of the nation were
</p>
<p>regimented and the moral forces for Ger-
</p>
<p>many's military machine provided.
</p>
<p>Just as Germany planned her own educa-
</p>
<p>tional system with reference to her military
</p>
<p>power, so she sought, as a part of her higher
</p>
<p>strategy, to enhance her superiority by insinu-
</p>
<p>ating herself into the moral and intellec-
</p>
<p>tual life of foreign countries. German
</p>
<p>schools and churches abroad she set down
</p>
<p>as important outposts of her power. If, in
</p>

<p>we expect to hold our own against the one-

<p>hundred-and-twenty-five millions who already

<p>the preservation and promotion of German-

<p>inspired by the fanatical belief in Germany's

<p>destiny as a world empire, the School Alliance,
</p>
<p>by the ambition to make the German language

<p>the world language and to impose Kultur upon
</p>
<p>every race. One ambition was merely the
</p>
<p>complement of the other; the cultural work of
</p>
<p>the School Alliance was an important means
</p>
<p>for the achievement of the military and polit-
</p>
<p>ical objects of the Pan-Germanists.

<p>The School Alliance established schools and

</p>
<p>libraries in foreign lands, kept in touch with
</p>
<p>those already in existence, and, where neces-
</p>
<p>sary, rendered financial aid. It maintained a

<p>teachers' bureau for the purpose of supplying
</p>
<p>German-trained educators wherever needed.
</p>
<p>A few years ago the Alliance was merged into
</p>
<p>the "Society for Germanism in Foreign Lands"
</p>
<p>(Verein fiir das Deutschthum im Auslande)
</p>
<p>and its activities were widened and pursued
</p>
<p>with increasing energy. The German govern-

<p>ment assisted with an annual subvention of a
</p>
<p>million marks. The society now undertook to
</p>
<p>segregate the German immigrant populations
</p>
<p>from the native populations in foreign lands,
</p>
<p>to give them solidarity socially and econom-
</p>
<p>ically, and to organise them into political units
</p>
<p>which would influence the policies of the gov-
</p>
<p>ernments under which they lived in favour of
</p>
<p>German schemes. To facilitate the creation
</p>
<p>of a state within the state, the society pro-
</p>
<p>cured the enactment of the notorious Delbriick

<p>Law. A German could now, even after natu-

<p>with the rights it afforded, to the purposes of

</p>
<p>Not content with its own people, the society
</p>
<p>carried its propaganda into the native popula-
</p>
<p>tions of foreign countries. "German schools
</p>
<p>abroad/' so it declared, "should not only pre-
</p>
<p>serve German nationality among the children
</p>
<p>of German immigrants, but should impart Ger-
</p>
<p>man Kultur to the youth of the countries where
</p>
<p>they operate." In these terms German schol-
</p>
<p>ars and technicians, who were called to educa-
</p>
<p>tional positions abroad, conceived their mis-
</p>
<p>sion.
</p>
<p>Nowhere did the Verein operate so actively
</p>
<p>or so successfully as in the United States. For
</p>
<p>years it maintained its secret agents in our
</p>
<p>midst, working in favour of German language
</p>
<p>schools and pulling wires for a German polit-
</p>
<p>ical party. German teachers laboured inces-
</p>
<p>santly to convert the so-called "Anglo-Saxon"
</p>
<p>section of the population into janizaries of
</p>
<p>Kultur. "The spirit of German Kultur,"  so

<p>"Not only North America, but the whole of

<p>America must become the bulwark of German-

</p>
<p>man as far back as 1906. "It should be the
</p>
<p>task of Germans in America not to rest until
</p>
<p>'Americanising' means the same thing as 'Ger-
</p>
<p>manising/ " echoed the self -constituted leaders
</p>
<p>of the German element in the United States.
</p>
<p>Reviewing in 1909 its work in America, the
</p>
<p>Society for Germanism in Foreign Lands was
</p>
<p>able to set down that "had this annual meeting
</p>
<p>brought nothing more to the Verein than the

<p>inspiring report of Germanism in North Amer-

<p>the promises for future co-operation, those

<p>things alone would have been of immense sig-

</p>
<p>Conditions in America have, from the be-
</p>
<p>ginning, been exceptionally favourable to Ger-
</p>
<p>many's plans.
</p>
<p>In 19 10 there were in our population no less
</p>
<p>than twenty-five millions of people who were
</p>
<p>either wholly or partly of German descent.
</p>
<p>Included in this number were three millions
</p>
<p>who were natives of Germany. Among the lat-
</p>
<p>ter were over half a million reservists  men,
</p>
<p>that is to say, who had received at least one
</p>
<p>year of training in the German army and with
</p>
<p>whom the German government, through her
</p>
<p>consular officials, kept in constant touch in an-
</p>
<p>ticipation of the occasion that would require

<p>22 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>from the British Isles, Has contributed the larg-
</p>
<p>est number to our population. The varying
</p>
<p>character of this immigration has reflected
</p>
<p>pretty accurately the conditions in the home-
</p>
<p>land. Beginning in 1683, and during a large
</p>
<p>part of the eighteenth century, there came
</p>
<p>the sectaries seeking religious liberty. They
</p>
<p>brought with them religious enthusiasm and
</p>
<p>sentimental attachment for the language and
</p>
<p>customs of their old home, but they were en-
</p>
<p>tirely devoid of pride of country and of na-
</p>
<p>tional consciousness. It was community of
</p>
<p>religious beliefs, rather than race or origin,
</p>
<p>that led them to establish themselves in Penn-
</p>
<p>sylvania, New York, and North and South
</p>
<p>Carolina in self-sufficient, compact communi-
</p>
<p>ties.
</p>
<p>In the first half of the nineteenth century
</p>
<p>there followed the political idealists, the prod-
</p>
<p>ucts of the political upheavals of 1820 and 1832
</p>
<p>and of the revolution of 1848. They sought
</p>
<p>America as a refuge where they might work
</p>
<p>out the national aspirations thwarted by the
</p>
<p>narrow particularism of their petty princes.

<p>man universities, brought with them an intense
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 23
</p>
<p>pride of nationality and at the same time a bit-
</p>
<p>ter hostility for the political and social condi-
</p>
<p>tions which they had left behind. There was
</p>
<p>nothing in the institutions of the Germany of
</p>
<p>their day to command their allegiance. What
</p>
<p>they hoped for was an ideal Germany in Amer-
</p>
<p>ica. Under the influence of their intense na-
</p>
<p>tionalism, their fellow-countrymen in the
</p>
<p>United States began to organise themselves
</p>
<p>into societies on racial lines, preserving
</p>
<p>thereby those things which, to their minds,
</p>
<p>made up the Germany of their dreams. In
</p>
<p>1849, there was organised the "National Sang-
</p>
<p>erbund." The Turners formed a national or-
</p>
<p>ganisation in 1850; and so it was with many
</p>
<p>other associations in which intellectual gym-
</p>
<p>nastics and national poetry and literature were
</p>
<p>cultivated.
</p>
<p>But the great waves of immigration, which,
</p>
<p>gathering volume in the 70's, finally reached
</p>
<p>their flood in the 8o's, came from entirely dif-
</p>
<p>ferent impulses. What these millions sought
</p>
<p>was neither religious freedom nor political lib-
</p>
<p>erty, but economic opportunity. No longer as
</p>
<p>outcasts or as refugees did they enter our

<p>gates, but as representatives of an empire of
</p>
<p>24 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>whose achievements they were proud and of
</p>
<p>whose future they vaguely hoped to remain a
</p>
<p>part. They combined attachment for their
</p>
<p>language and traditions with intense national
</p>
<p>consciousness and pride of country. As Ger-
</p>
<p>man power and prestige in Europe increased,
</p>
<p>so every year arriving immigrants manifested
</p>
<p>an increasing racial solidarity which tended to
</p>
<p>make the processes of assimilation increasingly
</p>
<p>difficult. They clung more and more tena-
</p>
<p>ciously to their language and customs; they
</p>
<p>drew together into their own societies,
</p>
<p>churches, and groups in which the German
</p>
<p>language was used and in which the intellectual
</p>
<p>outlook was obtained through a German lan-
</p>
<p>guage press.
</p>
<p>The new spirit was strikingly manifested in
</p>
<p>Wisconsin some twenty-five years ago. In
</p>
<p>1888 William Dempster Hoard was elected
</p>
<p>governor. He discovered that forty-seven
</p>
<p>thousand children, constituting fourteen per
</p>
<p>centum of the total school population of the
</p>
<p>state, were not attending school at all ; further,

<p>Lutheran schools the pupils were receiving no
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 25
</p>
<p>instruction whatever in English, the language
</p>
<p>of their country.
</p>
<p>This led to the enactment in 1889 of the so-
</p>
<p>called Bennett School Law. It required the
</p>
<p>attendance of all children between the ages of
</p>
<p>seven and fourteen years upon some public or
</p>
<p>private day school. The law further provided
</p>
<p>that no educational institution should be re-
</p>
<p>garded as a school within the intent of the act
</p>
<p>unless there were taught therein reading, writ-
</p>
<p>ing, arithmetic, and United States history
</p>
<p>through the medium of the English language.
</p>
<p>The law immediately became the object of
</p>
<p>the most bitter attacks, and a political move-
</p>
<p>ment was inaugurated looking to its repeal.

<p>Churches having parochial schools organised

<p>to defeat Governor Hoard at the polls. Their

<p>opposition accomplished what nothing else had

<p>succeeded in doing since the days of Luther

<p>it united the German Lutherans and German
</p>
<p>Catholics in one political party for one pur-
</p>
<p>pose. Governor Hoard was defeated and the

</p>
<p>From the beginning, America has been hos-
</p>
<p>pitable to foreign customs and ideas. The ties
</p>
<p>of tradition which bound the colonies to Eng-
</p>
<p>land were severed, for the most part, by the
</p>
<p>Revolutionary War. The process was com-
</p>
<p>pleted by the War of 1812. Later on, the diplo-
</p>
<p>matic difficulties of the Civil War  the rec-
</p>
<p>ognition of the Southern States, the 'Trent
</p>
<p>Affair" and the "Alabama Claims"  served to
</p>
<p>accentuate in American life a surviving preju-
</p>
<p>dice against the country from which we inher-
</p>
<p>ited the institutions we prize most highly. For
</p>
<p>fifty years the sport of "twisting the lion's
</p>
<p>tail" continued to be the favourite device of
</p>
<p>every demagogue and cheap politician who
</p>
<p>wished to attract attention. The further the
</p>
<p>new immigrants pushed into the wilderness
</p>
<p>and out onto the prairies, the less was there of
</p>
<p>local tradition in their way, and the conditions
</p>
<p>for the preservation of their language and for
</p>
<p>maintaining their national traditions became
</p>
<p>the more favourable. In this way Wisconsin,

<p>population which fostered, without opposition

<p>or unfavourable influences, the German lan-

</p>
<p>The severance of English traditions had a
</p>
<p>marked influence upon the educators and lead-
</p>
<p>ers of thought in America. There was no
</p>
<p>longer any attraction of sentiment or tradition
</p>
<p>to draw them to Oxford or Cambridge.
</p>
<p>Young and ambitious scholars felt free to roam
</p>
<p>where their tastes and their enthusiasms at-
</p>
<p>tracted them. Following the lead of George
</p>
<p>Ticknor, Edward Everett, and George Ban-
</p>
<p>croft, American scholars began to visit the
</p>
<p>Universities of Gottingen, Berlin, Leipsic and
</p>
<p>Halle. Previous to 1850 about one hundred
</p>
<p>Americans had enjoyed the advantages of
</p>
<p>these institutions. During the latter half of
</p>
<p>the century the number increased rapidly every
</p>
<p>year until it was asserted recently that there
</p>
<p>was not an instructor or a professor in any
</p>
<p>college or university in America who had not
</p>
<p>either studied in Germany or had not come
</p>
<p>under the influence of some one who had drunk

<p>Kaiser in Potsdam in June, 19 13, and concludes

<p>with the statement that "whoever is responsible

<p>for bringing about the war or letting it come

</p>
<p>a heavy indictment. . . . But whoever it was

<p>30 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>speeches, mighty salamanders and telegrams of
</p>
<p>congratulation to the Kaiser, their Kommilito
</p>
<p>of Bonn University, the "Union of Old German
</p>
<p>Students" (Vereinignng alter deutscher Stu-
</p>
<p>dent en in Amerika), came into being. From
</p>
<p>that time on its annual banquets and Kommers
</p>
<p>served to strengthen and keep alive the impres-
</p>
<p>sions of student days. "These Americans who
</p>
<p>have attended German universities are perma-
</p>
<p>nently inoculated with the German virus," ex-
</p>
<p>claimed Carl Beck, the first president of the
</p>
<p>Union. "They have only good things to tell
</p>
<p>of Germany. Even for German immoralities
</p>
<p>they have words of extenuation  yes, they go
</p>
<p>so far in their courtesies as even to imitate our
</p>
<p>faults!"
</p>
<p>Then came the exchange professorships. In
</p>
<p>1904 Harvard entered into an arrangement
</p>
<p>with the Prussian Ministry of Education
</p>
<p>whereby one of its professors and one from
</p>
<p>Berlin University should, every year, enter for
</p>
<p>three months the teaching staff of the other
</p>
<p>institution. Soon thereafter the Kaiser of-
</p>
<p>fered to extend the scope of the agreement to
</p>
<p>other universities in America and Germany.

</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 31
</p>
<p>James Speyer endowed still another exchange
</p>
<p>professorship at the University of Berlin. In
</p>
<p>1912 Jacob H. Schifl presented the German
</p>
<p>Department of Cornell University with one
</p>
<p>hundred thousand dollars as a foundation for
</p>
<p>the promotion of German Kultur in America.
</p>
<p>In 191 1 Wisconsin citizens of German descent
</p>
<p>raised a fund of thirty thousand dollars and
</p>
<p>gave it in trust to the regents of the state uni-
</p>
<p>versity "for the maintenance of a professor's
</p>
<p>chair, to be known as the Carl Schurz Memo-
</p>
<p>rial Professorship, which is to be filled from

<p>time to time and for such lengths of time as
</p>
<p>will be found advisable by visiting professors
</p>
<p>of recognised character and standing from the
</p>
<p>universities of Germany." The University of
</p>
<p>Chicago also instituted an informal exchange
</p>
<p>of lecturers.
</p>
<p>It is more than doubtful that the exchange
</p>
<p>professorships contributed in any way to schol-
</p>
<p>arship. Even in Germany they were regarded
</p>
<p>as a sort of court hobby, a good publicity enter-

</p>
<p>said, they proved absolute failures. But they
</p>
<p>did aid German purposes. Such men as Eu-

</p>
<p>from their purely academic duties to spread the
</p>
<p>tenets of Pan-Germanism among their coun-
</p>
<p>trymen in America. The American professors,
</p>
<p>falling victims to the attention they received in
</p>
<p>Germany, became infected with the virus of
</p>
<p>modern Germanism and upon their return
</p>
<p>spread the infection among their colleagues.
</p>
<p>How else can one account for the strange men-
</p>
<p>tal twist that caused such a profound student
</p>
<p>of constitutional history as John W. Burgess
</p>
<p>to tell his countrymen that " there is no longer

<p>a British constitution according to American

<p>ideas of constitutional government. ... In

<p>this only true sense of constitutional govern-

<p>ism. . . . The Russian economic and political

<p>systems have more points of likeness with the

<p>British than is usually conceded" ? How other-
</p>
<p>wise could he have been brought to tell Ameri-
</p>
<p>cans that "down to August i, 1914, German

<p>diplomacy, backed by German militarism, had

</p>
<p>eventful day British diplomacy triumphed over
</p>
<p>German diplomacy and sealed the union by
</p>
<p>British determination to destroy the naval and
</p>
<p>commercial power of Germany"?
</p>
<p>Among the men who had been appointed to
</p>
<p>lectureships in her universities Germany found
</p>
<p>her most effective apologists. Their testimony
</p>
<p>was given again and again through the subsi-
</p>
<p>dised pages of the Fatherland, on the lecture
</p>
<p>platform, and through the publications of the
</p>
<p>"German University League." Their names
</p>
<p>were used repeatedly in the movements engi-
</p>
<p>neered by German agents for Germany's ad-
</p>
<p>vantage. They appeared on the roster of such
</p>
<p>camouflaged organisations as the "Friends of
</p>
<p>Peace," the "American Independence Union,"
</p>
<p>the "American Embargo Conference" and the
</p>
<p>"Printers and Publishers Association."
</p>
<p>Members of the German departments in our
</p>
<p>universities, as time went by, confined them-
</p>
<p>selves less and less to the teaching of German
</p>
<p>language and of German literature. As Pro-
</p>
<p>fessor H. C. G. von Jagemann expressed it,

<p>"They conceived their true function to be not
</p>
<p>merely to teach the German language, or even

<p>German literature, however important these

<p>34 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>might be, but to give their students a true con-
</p>
<p>ception of what Germany stands for in modern
</p>
<p>civilisation, what her ideals have been and
</p>
<p>what she has contributed to the world's best
</p>
<p>intellectual possessions."
</p>
<p>Carrying out this conception, learned socie-
</p>
<p>ties were founded, such as the "Germanistic
</p>
<p>Society of America/' with headquarters in
</p>
<p>New York, and the "Germanistic Society of
</p>
<p>Chicago," both having for their expressed ob-
</p>
<p>jects the "promotion of the knowledge of Ger-
</p>
<p>man civilisation in America and of American
</p>
<p>civilisation in Germany"  and both ignoring
</p>
<p>the latter object and devoting all their efforts
</p>
<p>to spreading German ideas. So marked did
</p>
<p>this tendency become that Professor John F.
</p>
<p>Coar refused election to the board of directors
</p>
<p>of the New York Society unless some attention
</p>
<p>was given to familiarising men in Germany
</p>
<p>with things American.
</p>
<p>To more adequately foster the German
</p>
<p>spirit, "German houses" were established at
</p>
<p>Wisconsin, Columbia, and other institutions;
</p>
<p>German clubs were founded, like that at Cor-

<p>tional consciousness of the Germans in the

<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 35
</p>
<p>United States." At Cornell, the club dis-
</p>
<p>tributed war literature, conducted discussions
</p>
<p>of war topics, and corrected misapprehensions
</p>
<p>as to "the righteous German cause/' All these
</p>
<p>societies were finally amalgamated into the "In-
</p>
<p>tercollegiate League of German Clubs/' The
</p>
<p>league came completely under German influ-
</p>
<p>ence when, at its 191 5 convention, it reduced
</p>
<p>its advisory board from twelve to three mem-
</p>
<p>bers and appointed as these three an exchange
</p>
<p>professor of violent pro-German tendencies,
</p>
<p>now under indictment for treason, an-
</p>
<p>other professor from New York University,
</p>
<p>also violently pro-German, and a member of
</p>
<p>Germany's subsidised and official propaganda
</p>
<p>board.
</p>
<p>It was an easy step from the attitude ex-
</p>
<p>pressed by Professor von Jagemann to active
</p>
<p>propaganda for German policies which came
</p>
<p>to characterise the class rooms of many Ger-
</p>

<p>teract this growing obsession of Germanism.
</p>
<p>36 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>For years the elective plan  a plan which per-
</p>
<p>mitted a student to choose his college course
</p>
<p>pretty much according to his inclinations and
</p>
<p>his private advantage  had been running riot.
</p>
<p>The State was thus neglecting a most potent
</p>
<p>resource of its own life. To secure the con-
</p>
<p>tinuity of that life, to protect it against hostile
</p>
<p>machinations, and to insure its development by
</p>
<p>evolution rather than by revolution, the State
</p>
<p>should, in justice to itself, demand that every
</p>
<p>one who profits by the education which it af-
</p>
<p>fords study the history and nature of its own
</p>
<p>being. It has been well said that "the roots
</p>
<p>of the present lie deep in the past, and nothing
</p>
<p>in the past is dead to the man who would learn
</p>
<p>how the present came to be what it is." A
</p>
<p>student who has made this study appreciates
</p>
<p>the painful processes by which humanity has
</p>
<p>advanced; he realises how history records no
</p>
<p>short cuts and no magic formulae for improv-
</p>
<p>ing the condition of men; he understands how,
</p>
<p>in our institutions to-day, imperfect though
</p>
<p>they may be, there are nevertheless embodied
</p>
<p>the fervent hopes, the sacrifices, and the lives
</p>
<p>of thousands in the past. With such a his-

<p>torical background he is less inclined to barter
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 37
</p>
<p>his birthright for any chance mess of pottage
</p>
<p>brewed by a political or an economic quack, or
</p>
<p>by a foreign propagandist, however savoury it
</p>
<p>may be. Without such a retrospect our young
</p>
<p>men fall easy victims to any plausible vagary
</p>
<p>that ignores history and whose only postulate
</p>
<p>is a pious wish.
</p>
<p>To a business man who has been permitted
</p>
<p>to view our universities from the outside, it
</p>
<p>would seem that the inherent weakness of the
</p>
<p>elective system has been largely responsible
</p>
<p>for the marked obsession for all things German
</p>
<p>which has characterised our universities in the
</p>
<p>past. It was responsible also for another ten-
</p>
<p>dency, a tendency towards a shallow, supercili-
</p>
<p>ous cosmopolitanism. The man who knows
</p>
<p>least about his own country, and who, for that
</p>
<p>very reason, knows nothing about any other,
</p>
<p>is always prone to advertise his utter useless-
</p>
<p>ness as a citizen in any community by loudly
</p>
<p>proclaiming himself a citizen of all. So we
</p>
<p>had the cosmopolitan movement in our univer-
</p>
<p>sities beginning with the founding of a cos-
</p>
<p>mopolitan club at the university of Wisconsin
</p>
<p>in 1902. A year later a similar club was es-

<p>tablished at Cornell. The idea spread to other
</p>
<p>38 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>universities and in 1907 an association of cos-
</p>
<p>mopolitan clubs was formed at Madison. In
</p>
<p>19 1 3 an international congress was called at
</p>
<p>Ithaca, New York, for the purpose of "bring-
</p>
<p>ing together the representatives from all the
</p>
<p>students of the world in order that the spirit
</p>
<p>of international brotherhood and humanity
</p>
<p>may be fostered among them and in order that
</p>
<p>the students of the world might be united into
</p>
<p>an all-embracing world organisation"  thus

<p>Louis P. Lochner.
</p>
<p>In this environment of unhistorical thinking
</p>
<p>and shallow cosmopolitanism, pacifism readily
</p>
<p>took root. Pacifist societies, such as the "Colle-
</p>
<p>giate anti-Militarism League," flourished. Such
</p>
<p>men as President David Starr Jordan, Pro-
</p>
<p>fessor H. W. L. Dana, Dr. John H. Holmes,
</p>
<p>and Scott Nearing posed as the leaders. They
</p>
<p>drew unto them an assortment of callow youth
</p>
<p>intent on advertising their mental aberrations
</p>
<p>on the soap box, on the platform and in the
</p>
<p>prisoner's dock, just as certain fakirs in the

<p>their deformities to an adoring entourage. It

<p>nium of universal peace." He attributed the
</p>
<p>peace movement in America principally to
</p>
<p>avarice and self-interest, the anxiety of Ameri-
</p>
<p>cans to escape the burdens of taxation and
</p>
<p>personal service involved in preparedness for
</p>
<p>war, and also to a "certain effeminate senti-

<p>mentalism which prevails among the educated

<p>classes  a feeling which is aided by the circum-

<p>stance that the education of the youth in the

<p>tirely in the hands of women/'
</p>
<p>At the same time the peace sentiment, to-

<p>gether with its morbid manifestations, were
</p>
<p>exploited to the utmost for Germany's advan-

<p>In spite of the favourable conditions in

<p>exceedingly able men who, in ever increasing

<p>numbers, came from Germany to occupy

<p>in industry, banking, and in the editorial offices
</p>
<p>of German language newspapers, and to fill the

<p>pulpits of German churches. These men had

<p>drunk deep of modern German philosophy and
</p>
<p>were completely obsessed by Pan-German am-
</p>
<p>bitions and by Germany's manifest destiny of

<p>world power. The great mass of the popula-

</p>
<p>few years have become assimilated in our popu-

<p>lation. The second generation invariably be-
</p>
<p>came most eager and whole-hearted in their
</p>
<p>Americanism. Even the opposition to the
</p>
<p>Bennett Law, in Wisconsin, had little immedi-

<p>ate political significance. It was rather expres-
</p>
<p>sive of the attachment of a population, largely
</p>
<p>of German birth, for the language of their
</p>
<p>fatherland. The German names which have

<p>appeared in every casualty list of our armies

<p>are convincing testimonials of the genuine pa-

<p>triotism of the great majority of our citizens

<p>of German descent.

<p>propaganda for the German language in parts
</p>
<p>of Austria and Hungary, could see no reason
</p>
<p>for such a movement in the United States, and
</p>
<p>the school alliance disintegrated.
</p>
<p>Those responsible for the German movement
</p>
<p>were not the laymen, but the intellectuals, pri-
</p>
<p>marily the scholars occupying positions in
</p>
<p>American universities. As far back as 1886
</p>
<p>an instructor in Johns Hopkins University had
</p>
<p>urged a union of all Germans in the United
</p>
<p>States for the maintenance of Germanism and
</p>
<p>the preservation of the German language.
</p>
<p>The idea was discussed and kept alive in aca-
</p>
<p>demic circles, but it was not until some time
</p>
<p>after the Spanish- American War that the oc-
</p>
<p>casion seemed opportune for its realisation.
</p>
<p>The action of the German Admiral Dieder-
</p>
<p>ichs in dogging Admiral Dewey's movements
</p>
<p>in Manila Bay naturally aroused intense re-
</p>
<p>sentment in the United States. This was in-
</p>
<p>tensified when it became known that early in
</p>
<p>1898, when war with Spain seemed inevitable,
</p>
<p>the German ambassador in Washington had

<p>ise from the United States not to violate the
</p>
<p>integrity of the Spanish colonial empire.
</p>
<p>In contrast with the popular resentment to-
</p>
<p>wards Germany was the rapidly developing
</p>
<p>entente with Great Britain. The administra-
</p>
<p>tion of distant colonial possessions, inhabited
</p>
<p>by foreign races, placed the United States in a
</p>
<p>situation analogous to that occupied by Great
</p>
<p>Britain, and an increasing sympathy between
</p>
<p>the English speaking nations became manifest.
</p>
<p>We, too, were taking up the white man's bur-
</p>
<p>den. Anglo-Saxon brotherhood was celebrated
</p>
<p>in prose and verse; Anglo-Saxon leadership
</p>
<p>and prestige were acclaimed. Cecil Rhodes
</p>
<p>realised the spirit of the times in providing Ox-
</p>
<p>ford scholarships for the best, all-'round prod-
</p>
<p>ucts of American universities; thus the bonds
</p>
<p>between the two great nations would be drawn
</p>
<p>closer year by year.
</p>
<p>A most serious threat was presented to Ger-
</p>
<p>many's plans. With an Anglo-Saxon entente
</p>
<p>making its power and influence felt in every
</p>
<p>part of the globe, the opportunity for world
</p>
<p>power would be forever lost,  the only alterna-
</p>
<p>tive was downfall.

<p>The intellectuals among the German element
</p>
<p>46 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>in the United States affected to see in the
</p>
<p>Anglo-Saxon entente a reflection upon their
</p>
<p>Teutonic character ; in this light they presented
</p>
<p>it to their countrymen through the press and
</p>
<p>from the platform. It was the policy of "im-
</p>
<p>perialism" that had brought the two branches
</p>
<p>of the Anglo-Saxon race together, and against
</p>
<p>"imperialism," not as a policy, but in its racial
</p>
<p>aspect, they directed their attack. They joined
</p>
<p>forces, but from different motives, with those
</p>
<p>who opposed imperialism on constitutional and
</p>
<p>humanitarian grounds.
</p>
<p>This was the beginning of the Lrerman move-
</p>
<p>ment in America. "In this manner," says
</p>
<p>Professor Julius Goebel, "the feeling of unity
</p>
<p>among German-Americans was made to blaze
</p>
<p>out brilliantly, and the way was prepared for
</p>
<p>the organisation of the 'National German-
</p>
<p>American Alliance/ "
</p>
<p>Organisations of every kind have always
</p>
<p>been a feature of German life in America.
</p>
<p>The National Sangerbund, the National Turn-
</p>
<p>er Alliance, the German-American Teachers'

<p>Alliance, organized in 1870, have already been

</p>
<p>many mutual aid and benefit societies, societies
</p>
<p>of Swabians, Bavarians, and those coming
</p>
<p>from other states, and innumerable other or-
</p>
<p>ganisations.
</p>
<p>In 1899, most of the Pennsylvania organisa-
</p>
<p>tions became federated in an alliance. This
</p>
<p>suggested a national organisation and, in 1900,
</p>
<p>delegates from German societies in Ohio,
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania, Maryland and Minnesota as-
</p>
<p>sembled in Philadelphia and formed a tem-
</p>
<p>porary association. On October 6, 190 1, a
</p>
<p>permanent organisation was perfected, known
</p>
<p>as the "National German-American Alliance,"
</p>
<p>and this achievement prominent Germans, both
</p>
<p>in the United States and in the Fatherland,
</p>
<p>have proclaimed as of the utmost consequence
</p>
<p>for the future of Germanism in America.
</p>
<p>The organisation immediately entered into
</p>
<p>friendly relations with the Pan-German
</p>
<p>League (Alldeutscher Verband) and with the
</p>
<p>General School Alliance (Allgemeinerdeutscher
</p>
<p>Schulverein zur Erhaltung des Deutschthums

<p>Pan-German ideas in America. The Propa-

<p>boasted of the superiority of their Kultur, de-
</p>
<p>48 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>nounced the Latin races as suffering in the last
</p>
<p>stages of decadence, described the British as
</p>
<p>hopelessly addicted to sport and besotted
</p>
<p>through wealth and luxury ; the Germans were
</p>
<p>the one race singled out by Providence to res-
</p>
<p>cue civilisation. In the same way the leaders
</p>
<p>of the National German-American Alliance
</p>
<p>extolled the superiority of the German ele-
</p>
<p>ment, painted in lurid colours the lust for
</p>
<p>money, the hypocrisy, the contempt for law
</p>
<p>and constituted authority, the cowardly sub-
</p>
<p>mission to public opinion, and the superfi-
</p>
<p>ciality of American life; it was their patriotic
</p>
<p>mission to impress their characteristics upon
</p>
<p>the decadent American, or Anglo-American,
</p>
<p>section of the population and save the country.
</p>
<p>In Germany they preached that decadent civili-
</p>
<p>sations, in the divine order of things, must
</p>
<p>give way to Kultur; in America, that moribund
</p>
<p>Anglo-Saxonism must be replaced by the Ger-
</p>
<p>man spirit. As Professor Voss of the Univer-
</p>
<p>sity of Wisconsin expressed it, "It is the beau-

<p>tiful and profitable task of German-Americans
</p>
<p>to prepare the way in this country for the Ger-
</p>
<p>man spirit and the German conception of life/'

<p>In Germany they taught their people that they
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 49
</p>
<p>were surrounded by enemies: Great Britain
</p>
<p>was stimulated by commercial jealousy and
</p>
<p>France by the revanche; in America, that the
</p>
<p>Anglo-American section of the population was
</p>
<p>envious of their success and of their sterling
</p>
<p>qualities and that they must band together in
</p>
<p>order to resist the encroachments and the en-
</p>
<p>mity of the so-called "nativists." Germany at-
</p>
<p>tempted to bring about an entente with Ireland ;
</p>
<p>she sent her agents to the Emerald Isle, and
</p>
<p>Irish school children were taught to declaim
</p>
<p>against the tyrant of the seas and to acclaim the
</p>
<p>day when that tyranny would be broken by a
</p>
<p>rising naval power, and Ireland would be given
</p>
<p>her freedom ; in America the leaders industri-
</p>
<p>ously cultivated the Irish element and flattered
</p>
<p>their anti-English prejudices. In 1907, the Na-
</p>
<p>tional German-American Alliance formed a
</p>
<p>working agreement for common action with
</p>
<p>the Ancient Order of Hibernians and, in con-
</p>
<p>junction with this organisation, opposed and
</p>
<p>defeated the arbitration treaties with Great
</p>
<p>Britain negotiated under the direction of Presi-
</p>
<p>dent Taft. Every effort of Germany to bring

<p>acted in renewed efforts for closer co-operation
</p>
<p>50 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>on the part of leaders of the German movement
</p>
<p>in America with those of Irish descent. In
</p>
<p>Germany, England was proclaimed as a com-
</p>
<p>mon enemy; in America, the Anglo-Saxons.
</p>
<p>The organisers of the alliance went into
</p>
<p>every state and community of the land. They
</p>
<p>went to all the singing societies, gymnastic or-
</p>
<p>ganisations, social clubs and church brother-
</p>
<p>hoods of every denomination. Distinctions of
</p>
<p>religion were of no moment  the supreme
</p>
<p>unity was their common Germanism. Local
</p>
<p>organisations they banded together into city
</p>
<p>alliances, the various city alliances they feder-
</p>
<p>ated into state alliances, and the state alliances
</p>
<p>they bound together as constituent members
</p>
<p>of the National German-American Alliance.
</p>
<p>The work received a tremendous impetus from
</p>
<p>the visit of Prince Henry and from the numer-
</p>
<p>ous banquets, celebrations and speeches of
</p>
<p>which it was the occasion. The Germanic
</p>
<p>Museum at Harvard added its impetus. Was
</p>
<p>not this collection of casts and sculptures rep-
</p>
<p>resentative of the glories and achievements of
</p>
<p>their race, and did it not call upon every man

<p>of German blood to claim his part in his racial
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 51
</p>
<p>heritage and to preserve to the utmost his
</p>
<p>racial individuality?
</p>
<p>The work was pushed until a state organi-
</p>
<p>sation had been completed for every state and
</p>
<p>also for the territory of Hawaii. In 191 6, the
</p>
<p>alliance claimed a membership of two and a
</p>
<p>half million and the control of over two and
</p>
<p>a half million votes. In 1907, posing as an
</p>
<p>"educational and patriotic organisation, ,, it
</p>
<p>hoodwinked Congress into giving it a special
</p>
<p>charter of incorporation. From that time on
</p>
<p>the legend "Incorporated by Act of Congress"
</p>
<p>appeared on all the literature of the organisa-
</p>
<p>tion. In this way the government of the
</p>
<p>United States was to become a party to its own
</p>
<p>undoing.
</p>
<p>With this organisation, and assisted by am-
</p>
<p>ple funds provided by the brewers and liquor
</p>
<p>dealers of the United States, the leaders aimed
</p>
<p>to consolidate all those of German descent into
</p>
<p>one racial, political, and economic bloc. "The
</p>
<p>National German-American Alliance aims to
</p>
<p>bring about this unity of feeling in the popu-
</p>

<p>only approximates its aim, namely the cen-

<p>52 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>tralisation of the German-American element,
</p>
<p>it will nevertheless have accomplished as great
</p>
<p>a work as was performed in 1871 by the Iron
</p>
<p>Chancellor/' They aimed to perfect, as they
</p>
<p>said, in their new home a secure support for
</p>
<p>German Kiiltur, thereby to enhance the glory
</p>
<p>of their race  "and the sooner the Germans in
</p>
<p>foreign lands come together for defence and
</p>
<p>offence, the more easily and the more purely
</p>
<p>will Germanism be preserved." They urged
</p>
<p>the German immigrant to become naturalised
</p>
<p>and to acquire the right to vote at the earliest
</p>
<p>opportunity, but at the same time, they im-
</p>
<p>pressed him with the thought that he should
</p>
<p>become American only in a political and geo-
</p>
<p>graphical sense and that in all other things 
</p>
<p>in feeling, in sentiment, and in language  he
</p>
<p>should remain German. The idea is well ex-
</p>
<p>pressed in a speech delivered by Professor
</p>
<p>Goebel of the University of Illinois, to the
</p>
<p>"United German Societies of New York," on
</p>
<p>May 27th, 19 1 2. This speech later appeared
</p>
<p>in a volume of Professor Goebers speeches and
</p>
<p>essays, published in Germany in 1914. He

<p>says;
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 53
</p>
<p>A few years ago there appeared, under the
</p>
<p>title "The Melting Pot/' a drama in which
</p>
<p>the author, a well-known Zionist, Israel
</p>
<p>Zangwill, announced as the final conclusion
</p>
<p>of all wisdom, that America was the great
</p>
<p>Melting Pot in which the different races and
</p>
<p>Nationalities, with everything that distin-
</p>
<p>guished them  their languages, their inheri-
</p>
<p>tances, their views, and their customs 
</p>
<p>would be thrown in order that in that Melt-
</p>
<p>ing Pot they should be transformed into
</p>
<p>"Americans." For us German-Americans
</p>
<p>this preachment of this play denotes a mix-
</p>
<p>ture of empty phrase and unhistorical think-
</p>
<p>ing. It represents the very opposite of what
</p>
<p>we are striving for, and this ideal of the
</p>
<p>Melting Pot must be opposed and defeated
</p>
<p>by us the more decisively the more enthusi-
</p>
<p>astically it is taken up by the thoughtless
</p>
<p>rabble. . . . We do not need to permit our-
</p>
<p>selves to be remoulded and transformed in-
</p>
<p>to "Americans/' but we are Americans in a
</p>
<p>political sense, and in that sense alone, when
</p>
<p>we take our oath of allegiance and unite
</p>
<p>ourselves to the great body of our German-
</p>
<p>American racial kin. . . .

<p>Thanks to German resistance, the Roman
</p>

<p>54 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>ent races in order to subject them to the yoke
</p>
<p>of a common language as of a common state
</p>
<p>and political organisation. The open or
</p>
<p>concealed attempt to submerge our German
</p>
<p>racial individuality  that is, our speech, our
</p>
<p>customs, and conceptions  in the slop
</p>
<p>kitchen of a national Melting Pot has its ori-
</p>
<p>gin in the same hallucination and will also,
</p>
<p>though it may be in a different manner, be
</p>
<p>bitterly avenged.
</p>
<p>In this way was the spirit of the Delbriick
</p>
<p>Law implanted in America by a man holding a
</p>
<p>chair in an American university and supported
</p>
<p>by American taxpayers !
</p>
<p>How was this solidarity of the German ele-
</p>
<p>ment to be achieved? Primarily by conserv-
</p>
<p>ing the German language, for, as Fichte said,
</p>
<p>"What the root is to the tree, that the German
</p>
<p>language is to Germans/' "Racial individual-
</p>
<p>ity and speech are inseparately related," de-
</p>
<p>clared the Alliance. "If we wish to preserve
</p>
<p>the former for ourselves and our descendants,
</p>
<p>then we must cultivate and guard the latter as
</p>
<p>a priceless possession."

</p>
<p>this could be effected by fostering the German
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 55
</p>
<p>language press, German churches, and the Ger-
</p>
<p>man stage. But in view of the fact that Ger-
</p>
<p>man immigration practically ceased in the year
</p>
<p>1900, it became necessary to do something
</p>
<p>more in order to preserve the Germanism of
</p>
<p>America from extinction. With the cessation
</p>
<p>of the stream of immigration, it became neces-
</p>
<p>sary to make sure of the second generation,
</p>
<p>and also to win adherents among the other ele-
</p>
<p>ments of the population. "We must assure
</p>
<p>ourselves of the youth of the land," declared
</p>
<p>the president of the National Alliance to a
</p>
<p>convention of the Pennsylvania branch  "not
</p>
<p>only the German Americans, but the entire
</p>
<p>youth."
</p>
<p>The rising generation was thus marked for
</p>
<p>German propaganda and the means of reach-
</p>
<p>ing the youth was obviously through the
</p>
<p>schools, both private and denominational, and
</p>
<p>the public schools of the land. "For the
</p>
<p>preservation of Germanism in the United
</p>
<p>States nothing is more necessary than the
</p>
<p>preservation and creation of German schools,"
</p>
<p>declared the Alliance at its convention in 1903.

<p>America is not fulfilled by far, it is only be-

</p>
<p>gun." What was ultimately hoped for these
</p>
<p>schools was expressed in an article in the offi-
</p>
<p>cial organ of the Alliance, the "German- Amer-
</p>
<p>ican Annals," edited by professors of the lead-
</p>
<p>ing universities of the country :
</p>
<p>Only through the preservation of the Ger-
</p>
<p>man language can our race in this land be
</p>
<p>preserved from entire disappearance. The
</p>
<p>principal aim should be the founding of in-
</p>
<p>dependent parochial schools in which the
</p>
<p>language of instruction would be German,
</p>
<p>with English as the foreign language . . .
</p>
<p>and when these schools have once shown that
</p>
<p>they can offer as much as the public schools
</p>
<p>and that they are under the direction of
</p>
<p>trained, thorough teachers, then activity
</p>
<p>could be taken in the direction of securing
</p>
<p>for them financial support from the state,
</p>
<p>as in the case of public schools.
</p>
<p>But the leaders of the German movement
</p>
<p>did not await the slow process of establishing
</p>
<p>the prestige of German schools and securing
</p>
<p>for them state aid. They undertook to operate
</p>
<p>directly upon the public school system. "Strict

<p>declared, and early in the career of the Alii-
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 57
</p>
<p>ance, the following programme was laid down :
</p>
<p>i. The teaching of the German language in
</p>
<p>all elementary schools, beginning, preferably,
</p>
<p>with the first grade; such teaching, moreover,
</p>
<p>to be given in such a manner "as to produce
</p>
<p>familiarity with Germany and with the Ger-
</p>
<p>man race in America";
</p>
<p>2. "A dignified place in the curriculum for
</p>
<p>German history";
</p>
<p>3. "The rewriting of American history so
</p>
<p>that not only descendants of the Anglo-Saxon
</p>
<p>race, but those also of the German and of other
</p>
<p>races who have contributed to the civilisation
</p>
<p>of the United States may come into their
</p>
<p>rights, and so that contemptuous expressions,
</p>
<p>such for instance as those applied to the Hes-

<p>school text books" ;

<p>58 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>state alliances and the city branches organised
</p>
<p>in a similar manner, usually with an educator
</p>
<p>from the state university or from some local
</p>
<p>school in charge.
</p>
<p>In addition to this, every city alliance was
</p>
<p>ordered to get into touch and to co-operate
</p>
<p>with the German- American Teachers' Alliance
</p>
<p>(deutsch-amerikanischer Lehrerbund). This
</p>
<p>organisation was national in its scope, had
</p>
<p>branches in all the larger cities, and included
</p>
<p>most of the teachers of the German language.
</p>
<p>Every year it held a convention, widely known,
</p>
<p>both here and in Germany, as the "German-
</p>
<p>American Teachers' Day" (deutsch-amerikan-
</p>
<p>ischer Lehrertag), attended by instructors
</p>
<p>from all parts of the country. The 19 12 con-
</p>
<p>vention was held in the city of Berlin. Spe-
</p>
<p>cial arrangements and inducements were of-
</p>
<p>fered by the Hamburg-Amerika and Nord-
</p>
<p>deutscher Lloyd steamship companies; the
</p>
<p>delegates were given every attention, and sent
</p>
<p>home feeling that they were part of the Greater
</p>
<p>Germany which would some day dominate the
</p>
<p>world, not only in thought and speech, but in
</p>
<p>politics. They had become valuable agents in

<p>the dissemination of Germanism. The Pan-
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 59
</p>
<p>German League regarded them as part of its
</p>
<p>world embracing plan.
</p>
<p>Local branches of the National German-
</p>
<p>American Alliance were now ordered to sup-
</p>
<p>port the Teachers' Alliance in every way  to
</p>
<p>aid them in organising new branches, in secur-
</p>
<p>ing better teaching conditions, in boosting the
</p>
<p>attendance in German classes, in introducing
</p>
<p>instruction in the German language and in
</p>
<p>widening its scope wherever possible. In this
</p>
<p>respect the two organisations worked conven-
</p>
<p>iently hand in hand.
</p>
<p>In those communities where the introduction
</p>
<p>of German was left to the local school board,
</p>
<p>the procedure was to send questionnaires to can-
</p>
<p>didates for the board, ascertain their attitudes,
</p>
<p>and then to actively campaign for those who
</p>
<p>gave satisfactory answers. This was done in
</p>
<p>Chicago in 19 16; the result was a board almost
</p>
<p>unanimously in favour of the German lan-
</p>
<p>guage, and a special supervisor of German in-
</p>
<p>struction was engaged. In Detroit, even after
</p>
<p>the break in diplomatic relations, the city alli-
</p>
<p>ance interrogated candidates and prepared to
</p>
<p>enter the local campaign. In Indianapolis

</p>
<p>they succeeded in electing one of their own offi-
</p>
<p>60 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>cers, the first vice-president of the national or-
</p>
<p>ganisation, to the school board, and he 'later
</p>
<p>became its president. This worthy was at the
</p>
<p>same time the paid propagandist and organ-
</p>
<p>iser of the brewers and liquor dealers of Amer-
</p>
<p>ica. His activities in promoting Kultur, in
</p>
<p>furthering the free and unrestricted consump-
</p>
<p>tion of beer and whiskey and in advancing the
</p>
<p>education of the youth of Indianapolis seemed
</p>
<p>to dovetail together very conveniently. In
</p>
<p>Milwaukee, another vice-president of the na-
</p>
<p>tional alliance was made assistant superin-
</p>
<p>tendent of schools. His attitude was expressed
</p>
<p>in his report to the Wisconsin Alliance : 
</p>
<p>The Alliance should exert its utmost in-
</p>
<p>fluence in regard to educational matters; it
</p>
<p>is the duty of every branch to work for the
</p>
<p>introduction of German study in our public
</p>
<p>schools.
</p>
<p>In fact, in Milwaukee, Germanism had
</p>
<p>pretty much its own way about everything 
</p>
<p>the teaching of German was a regular part of
</p>
<p>all school work beginning with the first grade ;
</p>
<p>no child was excused except on special request

<p>from his parents. In Cincinnati, according to
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 61
</p>
<p>its records, the local alliance had the situation
</p>
<p>well in hand :
</p>
<p>In the session of the German-American
</p>
<p>City Alliance of Cincinnati the matter of
</p>
<p>German instruction came up for thorough
</p>
<p>discussion. It was asserted that in many
</p>
<p>schools only one hour of German instruction
</p>
<p>is given a day, whereas formerly there was a
</p>
<p>full half-day of instruction in German. This
</p>
<p>condition could be used by those who are
</p>
<p>not in favour of German teaching as an ar-
</p>
<p>gument for abolishing it altogether, on the
</p>
<p>ground that it is too expensive to keep spe-
</p>
<p>cial instructors just for one hour of instruc-
</p>
<p>tion a day.
</p>
<p>It was asserted in this connection that
</p>
<p>after the war there would undoubtedly come
</p>
<p>a strong movement for the abolition of Ger-
</p>
<p>man instruction throughout the land, since
</p>
<p>the Anglo-American population has learned
</p>
<p>from the things that have taken place in this
</p>
<p>country with reference to the European
</p>
<p>war, that the preservation of the mother
</p>
<p>tongue on the part of the immigrant is pre-
</p>
<p>cisely the thing which is the strongest fac-
</p>
<p>tor in preserving old country individuality
</p>
<p>and opinions.
</p>
<p>It was said that for that very reason even

</p>
<p>now we should be devising means for meet-
</p>
<p>62 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>ing this movement against German instruc-
</p>
<p>tion when the time comes. More especially
</p>
<p>should every German see to it that in his
</p>
<p>family German is spoken and German books
</p>
<p>and newspapers are read.
</p>
<p>A warning was given against making any
</p>
<p>concession whatever to the enemies of Ger-
</p>
<p>man teaching, since in that event it would
</p>
<p>slowly, though certainly, perish; nor could
</p>
<p>the prohibition movement have made the
</p>
<p>progress that it has, had not the liberal ele-
</p>
<p>ment continually made concessions to it.
</p>
<p>The Superintendent of Schools was highly
</p>
<p>praised in the discussion of the subject. It
</p>
<p>was said that he was a thorough-going
</p>
<p>friend of German teaching and that he fa-
</p>
<p>voured it at every opportunity, so that in
</p>
<p>Cincinnati at least there seemed to be as yet
</p>
<p>no danger to it.
</p>
<p>This probably accounts for the fact that a
</p>
<p>full year after the United States had entered
</p>
<p>the war this same superintendent, at a meeting
</p>
<p>of the Americanisation committee appointed
</p>
<p>by the governor of the state, found himself un-
</p>
<p>prepared to vote either in the affirmative or in
</p>
<p>the negative, on the question of the elimination
</p>
<p>of German instruction from the public schools.,

</p>
<p>Even greater vigilance was exercised in
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 63
</p>
<p>other localities where officials of the alliance
</p>
<p>regularly inspected the German classes. One
</p>
<p>of these men, shortly before the United States
</p>
<p>entered the war, visited the schools of Omaha
</p>
<p>and reported that he was more than pleased
</p>
<p>with what he found  the children were acquir-
</p>
<p>ing a typical Berlin accent, sang a number of
</p>
<p>songs to his entire approval and finally ended
</p>
<p>in rendering "Die Wacht am Rhein" with an
</p>
<p>enthusiasm and vigour which would have done
</p>
<p>credit to the children of the Fatherland, even
</p>
<p>a number of negro boys joining in the song
</p>
<p>with all their might and main ! To encourage
</p>
<p>pupils, medals were provided and in cities hav-
</p>
<p>ing German theatres local organisations were
</p>
<p>called upon to furnish free seats for students
</p>
<p>of German.
</p>
<p>Where state legislation was necessary to fa-
</p>
<p>cilitate the introduction of German, the alliance
</p>
<p>was equally active. Questionnaires on the pro-
</p>
<p>posed measures were sent to all candidates.
</p>
<p>This was done in Ohio in the election of 19 12.
</p>
<p>In this manner the state alliance of Nebraska
</p>
<p>secured the passage of the Mockett Law, re-
</p>
<p>quiring the teaching of a foreign language, be-

<p>language intended being, of course, German 
</p>
<p>whenever the parents of fifty children in at-
</p>
<p>tendance upon the school requested it. Imme-
</p>
<p>diately after the passage of the law, members
</p>
<p>of the alliance in Nebraska City circulated pe-
</p>
<p>titions requesting German instruction. The
</p>
<p>petitions were presented to the school authori-
</p>
<p>ties, but they hesitated to comply for the reason
</p>
<p>that it was found that less than one-third of
</p>
<p>the signers of the petitions intended to have
</p>
<p>their children take advantage of the instruc-
</p>
<p>tion, and that, as a consequence, the expense
</p>
<p>entailed would be out of proportion to the num-
</p>
<p>ber receiving the benefit. The members there-
</p>
<p>upon obtained a writ of mandamus compelling
</p>
<p>the school board to introduce the subject, the
</p>
<p>case was carried to the Supreme Court, and the
</p>
<p>constitutionality of the law and the issuance of
</p>
<p>the writ were upheld.
</p>
<p>In fact, nowhere did the educational pro-
</p>
<p>gramme of the National Alliance make such
</p>
<p>progress as in Nebraska. In 1910, an effort had
</p>
<p>been made to have the legislature enact a law

<p>requiring every child to attend the public
</p>
<p>schools at least three months in the year, and

</p>
<p>under the supervision of county school super-
</p>
<p>intendents. Lutheran and German Catholic
</p>
<p>clergymen joined with the state alliance in op-
</p>
<p>posing what was regarded as an attack upon
</p>
<p>Germanism, and the bill was killed in com-
</p>
<p>mittee, only one legislator out of nine having
</p>
<p>the courage to stand for Americanism!
</p>
<p>Parochial schools continued to grow until
</p>
<p>recently it was found that in nineteen school
</p>
<p>districts they had crowded out the public
</p>
<p>schools entirely.
</p>
<p>The German language newspapers, some six
</p>
<p>hundred in number, gave the propaganda un-
</p>
<p>divided support. Ever since the early 90's
</p>
<p>their steadily dwindling circle of German read-
</p>
<p>ers warned them that their circulation must be
</p>
<p>replenished from the rising generation  and
</p>
<p>Herman Ridder was frank enough to confess
</p>
<p>that his interest in German language instruc-
</p>
<p>tion arose out of his interest in the circulation
</p>
<p>of the Staats-Zeitung.
</p>
<p>Of course the propaganda never revealed its
</p>
<p>real purpose when presented to state legislators
</p>
<p>or to school boards. It always came before
</p>
<p>them in plausible pedagogical disguises. It

<p>68 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>member the time when the great aim in the
</p>
<p>study of English was to commit to memory
</p>
<p>the thirty-two rules of Smith's English
</p>
<p>Grammar, while it seemed not to occur even
</p>
<p>to the teacher that these rules were intended
</p>
<p>to be put into practice in speaking and writ-
</p>
<p>ing the language. The result was that the
</p>
<p>pupils left the English class with the same
</p>
<p>slipshod habit of incorrect speaking with
</p>
<p>which they entered,
</p>
<p>and his conclusion is that the remedy is the
</p>
<p>study of German  a remedy which one might
</p>
<p>be inclined to commend to the author himself
</p>
<p>in view of his samples of mixed metaphor and
</p>
<p>confused syntax. Another pamphlet, pub-
</p>
<p>lished in English under the name of the super-
</p>
<p>visor of German in the public schools of Cin-
</p>
<p>cinnati, contains the following:
</p>
<p>So, then, numerous authorities  many of
</p>
<p>them Americans  testify that the instruc-
</p>
<p>tion in German is not only in nowise a hin-
</p>
<p>drance to the progress of the scholars, but in
</p>
<p>striking wise a furtherance.
</p>
<p>And after speaking of the success attending
</p>
<p>instruction in German in Cincinnati, the author

</p>
<p>says:
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 69
</p>
<p>Such successes can be achieved, of course,
</p>
<p>only on condition that the instruction be ade-
</p>
<p>quate; that is to say, that the instructors be
</p>
<p>equal to their task, and that there be such
</p>
<p>a thing as aimful supervision. And even
</p>
<p>this kind of instruction is, alas, gauged only
</p>
<p>too often by ignorance and prejudice, if not
</p>
<p>the sheer lust of cavilling and undermining.
</p>
<p>Another educator from the Central High
</p>
<p>School, Philadelphia, exclaims :
</p>
<p>I, for my part, acknowledge that I should
</p>
<p>not exactly relish being charged with the
</p>
<p>task of manning or womaning (venia sit
</p>
<p>verbo) all our many public schools with
</p>
<p>thoroughly competent language-teachers. I
</p>
<p>fear I could not do it even with the help of
</p>
<p>Diogenic lanterns. Am I wrong, or are we
</p>
<p>placed between the Scylla of maintaining an
</p>
<p>undesirable status quo and the Charybdis
</p>
<p>of a possibly forthcoming halfness?
</p>
<p>Happily, America is about through with the
</p>
<p>"forthcoming halfness" produced in elemen-
</p>
<p>tary schools by the forcible introduction of the
</p>
<p>German language. These examples should
</p>
<p>serve as warnings of the huddled deformities

<p>of style which the continued study of German
</p>
<p>70 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>would have eventually introduced into the lan-
</p>
<p>guage of the country.
</p>
<p>The leaders of the German movement in
</p>
<p>America have always contended that history
</p>
<p>text-books used in the public schools were re-
</p>
<p>plete with falsifications ; that they showed most
</p>
<p>astounding omissions; that they purposely
</p>
<p>slighted heroes of German descent and over-
</p>
<p>looked the part the German element had played
</p>
<p>in the development of the country. They criti-
</p>
<p>cised, too, the omission of German history from
</p>
<p>the school curriculum. "Only with a back-
</p>
<p>ground of German political history, and above
</p>
<p>all of the history of German Kultur, can a
</p>
<p>proper understanding of American history be
</p>
<p>attained; only through the knowledge of the
</p>
<p>history of Germany can there be awakened in
</p>
<p>the German-American youth the well justified
</p>
<p>pride in their descent," so the Alliance declared
</p>
<p>at one of its conventions. Year by year, as ra-
</p>
<p>cial consciousness was intensified, they took
</p>
<p>deeper umbrage at these supposed affronts to
</p>
<p>their worth and insisted that the entire in-
</p>
<p>struction in history called loudly for thorough-
</p>
<p>going reform.

</p>
<p>This feeling gave rise to the formation
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 71
</p>
<p>throughout the country of German historical
</p>
<p>societies  a definitely related phase of the Ger-
</p>
<p>man movement. The "German- American His-
</p>
<p>torical Society," a national organisation, was
</p>
<p>incorporated in 1901, and began to affiliate
</p>
<p>with itself existing societies. Its purpose
</p>
<p>was the investigation, collection, and publica-
</p>
<p>tion of material relating to the history and
</p>
<p>culture of Germans in America, and to provide
</p>
<p>that due recognition be given to their efforts
</p>
<p>and achievements. The National Alliance en-
</p>

</p>
<p>72 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>League, urged that an outline treatise of Ger-
</p>
<p>man-American history be prepared, and its in-
</p>
<p>troduction in the public schools undertaken.
</p>
<p>To effect the desired reforms a delegation
</p>
<p>from the Alliance appeared before a commit-
</p>
<p>tee of the American Historical Association in
</p>
<p>1909  it was felt that this committee had an
</p>
<p>important influence on the text-books used and
</p>
<p>the courses of instruction. But the represen-
</p>
<p>tations of the Alliance were unavailing.
</p>
<p>Other plans for meeting the situation had
</p>
<p>therefore to be devised. In those districts
</p>
<p>where Germans were in the majority, the text-
</p>
<p>books could be controlled through the election
</p>
<p>of the members of the school board. But this
</p>
<p>would not accomplish the result principally de-
</p>
<p>sired  the enlightenment of Americans in
</p>
<p>those districts where the Americans were
</p>
<p>numerically stronger.
</p>
<p>The school committee therefore hit upon an
</p>
<p>original plan. "To reach an American one
</p>
<p>must get at his pocket book, ,, the chairman re-
</p>
<p>ported. The Alliance could best accomplish
</p>
<p>its purposes by allying itself with some ener-
</p>
<p>getic publishing house that had put out a book

</p>
<p>most nearly approaching the German point of
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 73
</p>
<p>view. The alliance could endorse such a book,
</p>
<p>and through its numerous branches advertise
</p>
<p>it, bring it to the attention of school boards,
</p>
<p>and secure its adoption. Requests for the in-
</p>
<p>sertion of other desirable matter could then
</p>
<p>be made of the publishers from time to time.
</p>
<p>Such a course was actually pursued in the case
</p>
<p>of Bourne and Benton's "School History of
</p>
<p>the United States," induced, no doubt, by these
</p>
<p>gratifying paragraphs : 
</p>
<p>They (the Germans) came in such num-
</p>
<p>bers that they almost succeeded in making
</p>
<p>Wisconsin a German state. Some parts of
</p>
<p>the West became a New Germany, just as
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania had been in the eighteenth cen-
</p>
<p>tury. To-day a large majority of the people
</p>
<p>of Wisconsin are German immigrants or
</p>
<p>their descendants.
</p>
<p>Some Special Debts to the Germans. 
</p>
<p>The Germans were better taught than most
</p>
<p>of the native Americans, because a new sys-
</p>
<p>tem of schools had been established in Ger-
</p>
<p>many. The skilled workingmen and the
</p>
<p>farmers were well trained. As citizens they
</p>
<p>helped to make better schools in the United
</p>
<p>States. Furthermore, American students
</p>
<p>began to go to Germany for higher educa-

</p>
<p>tion. In still other ways they deeply influ-
</p>
<p>74 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>enced American life. They had a taste and
</p>
<p>love for music and painting and sculpture
</p>
<p>that few Americans had at that time. Wher-
</p>
<p>ever they went they became the teachers of
</p>
<p>these arts. In a multitude of ways  by sing-
</p>
<p>ing societies, gymnastic organisations, open-
</p>
<p>air celebrations, fairs and frolics and festi-
</p>
<p>vals  they added to the wholesome pleasures
</p>
<p>of life.
</p>
<p>The book was endorsed by a number of state
</p>
<p>alliances and an active propaganda was un-
</p>
<p>dertaken in its behalf.
</p>
<p>At the same time a covert threat was exer-
</p>
<p>cised upon all publishers of text books through
</p>
<p>the request that they submit copies of their
</p>
<p>publications. They were made to appreciate
</p>
<p>the financial loss they would incur if they
</p>
<p>ignored Germanism in their presentation of
</p>
<p>history. Professor Samuel B. Harding, of the
</p>
<p>University of Indiana, relates an interesting
</p>
<p>incident in this connection. Early in 191 5, he
</p>
<p>prepared a chapter on the present war for use
</p>
<p>in a text book. He read it before the histori-
</p>
<p>cal society of the University. Within two
</p>
<p>weeks there were forwarded to him by his pub-

</p>
<p>lishers letters which they had received demand-
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 75
</p>
<p>ing that the chapter be omitted from the book,
</p>
<p>and practically threatening a boycott, not
</p>
<p>only of that particular book, but also of the
</p>
<p>firm as well. A letter from the educational
</p>
<p>committee of one of the state alliances threat-
</p>
<p>ened to bring the matter before the annual con-
</p>
<p>vention of the National German-American
</p>
<p>Alliance at its session in August, 191 5.
</p>
<p>The most insidious of all forms of German
</p>
<p>propaganda was that conducted through text-
</p>
<p>books used in the public schools and the fact
</p>
<p>that much of this propaganda was produced
</p>
<p>unconsciously and innocently by American-
</p>
<p>born scholars is convincing evidence of our
</p>
<p>shortcomings in not insisting upon education
</p>
<p>in political and institutional history. A na-
</p>
<p>tive American teacher in a Chicago high school
</p>
<p>produced a reading book for beginners in Ger-
</p>
<p>man. In it he contrasts the spirit of modern
</p>
<p>Germany with that of America in this wise:
</p>
<p>In our country where every youth in his
</p>
<p>first year in school learns that he may be
</p>
<p>president some day  where parents permit

<p>their children to look down upon their modest

<p>overcrowded, manual labour despised, the

<p>76 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>farms deserted, we often find in the serving
</p>
<p>class a weak, discontented lot of people.
</p>
<p>In sharp contrast to them were the people
</p>
<p>who served us in Germany. They knew
</p>
<p>what they had to do and did it without feel-
</p>
<p>ing that it injured their dignity.
</p>
<p>The author then goes on to tell of the punc-
</p>
<p>tilious attention given by the hotel porter, the
</p>
<p>chambermaid and baggage-hustler at the sta-
</p>
<p>tion  and all for a few pfennigs! The service
</p>
<p>of the chambermaid especially appealed to him.
</p>
<p>One could throw one's soiled linen on the bed
</p>
<p>or on the floor, ring the bell, and she would at-
</p>
<p>tend to it all. In twenty-four hours it would
</p>
<p>be back, and no distinction would be made be-
</p>
<p>tween Sundays and week days ! How the au-
</p>
<p>thor longed to kidnap one of these neat Ger-
</p>
<p>man girls and take her to America ! At night
</p>
<p>one would find the bed curtains drawn, the
</p>
<p>covers laid down and the nightgown ready.
</p>
<p>But as conditions in his own country flash upon
</p>
<p>his mind, the author's conscience smites him:
</p>
<p>In my heart I thought how foolish she
</p>
<p>would be if she came to America. How

</p>
<p>much she would lose! And what would be
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 77
</p>
<p>the gain? More money  and of what use
</p>
<p>would that be to her ?
</p>
<p>"This system suits me," exclaims the writer
</p>
<p>finally in ecstasy, after recounting the comforts
</p>
<p>of life in Germany. "And the prices! Com-
</p>
<p>pare them with what would be demanded in
</p>
<p>New York. A bum wanted a dollar for carry-
</p>
<p>ing three small handbags three blocks for us
</p>
<p>to the station !"
</p>
<p>And he recounts how they refused his prof-
</p>
<p>fer, and when a little nearer to the station
</p>
<p>another individual offered to perform the serv-
</p>
<p>ice for fifty cents. This also was refused, and
</p>
<p>then, when within a block and a half of their
</p>
<p>destination, another man offered to carry the
</p>
<p>baggage for twenty-five cents. He carried it
</p>
<p>a short distance and then turned it over to a
</p>
<p>boy to whom he gave a nickel for completing
</p>
<p>the task, keeping twenty cents for himself.
</p>
<p>And this incident the author gives as typical
</p>
<p>of America  a country where those who per-
</p>
<p>form the actual labour are not the ones to re-
</p>
<p>ceive the compensation.

</p>
<p>Note this specimen of adulation:
</p>
<p>Such was his first thought when the trum-

</p>
<p>Many rulers have shown themselves to be
</p>
<p>great in misfortune, but only a few of them,

<p>like Emperer Wilhelm, great while lucky.
</p>
<p>True to his convictions, he could pray to the

<p>Highest War Lord, who leads the army of

<p>stars, because He had manifested Himself
</p>
<p>to him through many expressions and to-
</p>
<p>kens. And as a Christian and a hero paying

<p>heed to these tokens, the Emperor had ac-

<p>quired a keen ear for God's words, a keen

<p>ear for hints which always made him follow

<p>80 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>are idealised. This selection, which the stu-
</p>
<p>dent is expected to translate into German, con-
</p>
<p>cludes :
</p>
<p>Although the German Emperor is a sol-
</p>
<p>dier through and through, it would be a mis-
</p>
<p>take to consider him a monarch anxious for
</p>
<p>war. On the contrary, he seeks with all his
</p>
<p>might to preserve the German people from
</p>
<p>the horror of war. The best proof of his
</p>
<p>peaceful disposition is the fact that Ger-
</p>
<p>many has had no war for forty years.
</p>
<p>The universities are treated in the following
</p>
<p>manner :
</p>
<p>The development of the German univer-
</p>
<p>sities during the nineteenth century since
</p>
<p>the founding of the University of Berlin in
</p>
<p>October, 1810, just a hundred years ago,
</p>
<p>presents a splendid picture. The universi-
</p>
<p>ties have had an inestimable influence on
</p>
<p>the German civilisation and even upon the
</p>
<p>political history and the economic progress
</p>
<p>of the country. Their representation is in-
</p>
<p>ternational and they occupy the first place
</p>
<p>among the scientific institutions of the world.
</p>

</p>
<p>bring the methods and ideals of the German
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 81
</p>
<p>university back with them to their own lands.
</p>
<p>The instruction at the American universities
</p>
<p>is based largely on German investigation and
</p>
<p>a large part of the professors at many of our
</p>
<p>colleges have spent at least one semester at
</p>
<p>a German university.
</p>
<p>Another exercise is an apology for German
</p>
<p>militarism:
</p>
<p>On three sides Germany has open bound-
</p>
<p>aries over which strong armies could easily
</p>
<p>march, if it were not ready for war at any
</p>
<p>time. No other great power of Europe is in
</p>
<p>such a dangerous position. A strong army
</p>
<p>is a necessity and now a powerful fleet seems
</p>
<p>to be just as necessary if Germany is to
</p>
<p>maintain its place among the great powers.
</p>
<p>Germany, however, desires quiet and peace
</p>
<p>and would not begin a war without reason.
</p>
<p>Indeed, the world has to thank Germany that
</p>
<p>peace has reigned so long in Europe. . . .
</p>
<p>As we have seen, Germany is forced by
</p>
<p>its position in the middle of the powerful
</p>
<p>European states to have a great army. . . .
</p>
<p>In order to maintain its position, Germany
</p>
<p>dare not give up this army, and it stands now
</p>
<p>at the beginning of the twentieth century as
</p>
<p>the first military power of Europe, and as
</p>
<p>we have already seen, the third sea power.

<p>At the beginning of the twentieth cen-
</p>
<p>82 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>tury, Germany still maintains its leading
</p>
<p>place in the field of art and science. Its
</p>
<p>laboratories and hospitals serve the other na-
</p>
<p>tions as models, its universities and conserv-
</p>
<p>atories are world-famed and are attended by
</p>
<p>students from all parts of the world. But
</p>
<p>now we may no longer think of Germany as
</p>
<p>a land merely of thinkers and dreamers, a
</p>
<p>land of poets, composers and scholars. Ger-
</p>
<p>many is no longer one-sided. It has now be-
</p>
<p>come an industrial and political power and
</p>
<p>we may confidently expect in the future
</p>
<p>progress in all fields of human activity.
</p>
<p>The German arguments for colonial expan-
</p>
<p>sion are put forth as follows : 
</p>
<p>The great problem of Germany in the
</p>
<p>twentieth century is the founding of new
</p>
<p>colonies and the development of its trade
</p>
<p>with its new colonies and with foreign lands.
</p>
<p>The German territory has now become too
</p>
<p>small for the German people. The sixty-
</p>
<p>eight million Germans need more land than
</p>
<p>they now possess in Europe. Therefore the
</p>
<p>present colonial policy of Germany is not
</p>
<p>merely a game; it is a necessity.
</p>
<p>And finally the author throws a sop to

<p>American sensibilities by proclaiming that "the
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 83
</p>
<p>German Constitution is in many respects simi-
</p>
<p>lar to the Constitution of the United States."
</p>
<p>Why, we may ask, the lugging of all this for-
</p>
<p>eign matter into a text-book on German com-
</p>
<p>position? It has no appropriate place in such
</p>
<p>a work. Can it be said that in view of the
</p>
<p>attitude taken by the National German- Ameri-
</p>
<p>can Alliance on school text-books, and in def-
</p>
<p>erence to their plans for endorsing and se-
</p>
<p>curing the adoption of such books as met with
</p>
<p>their approval, it behooved a writer to insert
</p>
<p>such material, and a publisher to give it promi-
</p>
<p>nence? Of one thing, however, we may be cer-
</p>
<p>tain  after a student has laboured over these
</p>
<p>exercises, translated them into German and
</p>
<p>discussed them in class, his mind is so thor-
</p>
<p>oughly saturated with ideas favourable to Ger-
</p>
<p>many that it is ready to react to the crudest
</p>
<p>form of propaganda.
</p>
<p>The propaganda found its way even into an
</p>
<p>English speller. It is seldom, indeed, that space
</p>
<p>is found in such a work for pieces of com-
</p>
<p>position. Nevertheless the books used in the

<p>84 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY

</p>
<p>THE KAISER IN THE MAKING
</p>
<p>In the gymnasium at Cassel the German
</p>
<p>Kaiser spent three years of his boyhood, a
</p>
<p>diligent but not a brilliant pupil, ranking
</p>
<p>tenth among seventeen candidates for the
</p>
<p>university.
</p>
<p>Many tales are told of this period of his
</p>
<p>life, and one of them, at least, is illuminat-
</p>
<p>ing.
</p>
<p>A professor, it is said, wishing to curry
</p>
<p>favour with his royal pupil, informed him
</p>
<p>overnight of the chapter in Greek that was
</p>
<p>to be made the subject of the next day's les-
</p>
<p>son.
</p>
<p>The young prince did what many boys
</p>
<p>would not have done. As soon as the class-
</p>
<p>room was opened on the following morning,
</p>
<p>he entered and wrote conspicuously on the
</p>
<p>blackboard the information that had been
</p>
<p>given him.
</p>
<p>One may say unhesitatingly that a boy
</p>
<p>capable of such an action has the root of a
</p>
<p>fine character in him, possesses that chival-
</p>
<p>rous sense of fair play which is the nearest

<p>One may well imagine the indignation that

<p>They went to Anglo-American schools

<p>and colleges, and they succumbed; not

<p>to find that many unknown thousands of
</p>
<p>German descendants, and particularly those
</p>
<p>that had enjoyed greater privileges, have
</p>
<p>been estranged from the German cause; yes,
</p>
<p>there are many Germans that are not only

<p>indifferent but opposed to the German spirit

<p>of to-day, that do not understand and

</p>
<p>class citizenship to a first-class one, perhaps
</p>
<p>the first-class citizenship of this great coun-
</p>
<p>try.
</p>
<p>But not enough, a university will never
</p>
<p>accomplish that alone; what is needed as

<p>much, if not first, is an educational system

<p>from bottom up  German schools, genuine

</p>
<p>all of them genuinely German, with German

<p>as the principal language all the way

</p>
<p>ought to be unless it is fed by correspond-

<p>turn out German scientists without German

<p>Professor Julius Goebel is more modest in

<p>his suggestions :

<p>German Kultur from which light and
</p>
<p>warmth would radiate. For the accomplish-
</p>
<p>ment of this high aim, I see in my mind an
</p>
<p>institute for German Kultur, fashioned
</p>
<p>somewhat after the model of the Berlin
</p>
<p>Academy of Sciences. This could be the

</p>
<p>the exchange of the cultural possessions of
</p>
<p>both peoples could take place in a fructify-
</p>
<p>ing manner. Here there should be culti-
</p>
<p>vated in addition to German-American his-
</p>
<p>tory, the past cultural relations between
</p>
<p>Germany and America  German language
</p>
<p>and literature, German history, German eth-
</p>
<p>nology, German history of art and German
</p>
<p>philosophy. From this place the results of
</p>
<p>the investigation would be spread by letter
</p>
<p>and by word of mouth to the most distant
</p>
<p>circles of the nation. For, although it would
</p>
<p>be the principal task of such an academy to
</p>
<p>bring on behalf of Kultur new life to our
</p>
<p>German- American race, still it would have
</p>
<p>to impart no less vigorously German Kultur
</p>
<p>to the Anglo-American portion of the popu-
</p>
<p>lation. In this manner only could the sound
</p>
<p>thought at the basis of the exchange profes-
</p>
<p>sorships be made fruitful and be made to
</p>
<p>materialise.
</p>
<p>The project for a university modelled along
</p>
<p>the lines of those in Germany, in which the
</p>
<p>German language, literature and culture
</p>
<p>would be given prominence, was brought for-
</p>
<p>ward at several conventions of the National

<p>ably discussed, the time did not seem ripe for
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 89
</p>
<p>the undertaking, and the Alliance therefore de-
</p>
<p>voted itself to influencing existing institutions.
</p>
<p>The first step, of course, was to secure greater
</p>
<p>recognition for the German language. As an
</p>
<p>entrance requirement it should be placed on
</p>
<p>the same footing as Latin. This reform was
</p>
<p>actually brought about in 19 13 in the Univer-
</p>
<p>sity of Nebraska. Latin came to be required
</p>
<p>only of medical students. "The teaching of
</p>
<p>German," so the school committee of the Na-
</p>
<p>tional German- American Alliance reported, "is
</p>
<p>therefore making great headway in the high
</p>
<p>schools of the state at the expense of Latin."
</p>
<p>In 1913, at its St. Louis convention, the
</p>
<p>National German- American Alliance organised
</p>
<p>a committee for the "establishment of rela-
</p>
<p>tions with American universities for the pro-
</p>
<p>motion of German Kultur," and appointed on
</p>
<p>the committee members of the faculties of
</p>
<p>Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan. Question-
</p>
<p>naires were sent to five hundred and forty-six
</p>
<p>colleges and universities in the United States
</p>
<p>for the purpose of ascertaining the number of
</p>
<p>students taking courses in German, the num-
</p>
<p>ber of these that were of German descent, and

<p>Never had the campus witnessed so imposing

<p>a demonstration in honour of any hero, for-

<p>92 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>IV
</p>
<p>GERMAN PROPAGANDA THROUGH
</p>
<p>AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES
</p>
<p>Immediately upon the outbreak of the
</p>
<p>world war the forces of Kultur in America be-
</p>
<p>gan their mobilisation. In the bewilderment
</p>
<p>of those first August days before war had even
</p>
<p>been declared between Great Britain and Ger-
</p>
<p>many,  while Americans were anxiously in-
</p>
<p>quiring the meaning of it all, the issues in-
</p>
<p>volved, who and what was responsible for the
</p>
<p>world catastrophe  was it Serbia, or Russia, or
</p>
<p>the Czar or could it be the Kaiser or the junker
</p>
<p>party in Germany, or was it British commercial
</p>
<p>jealousies  the National German-American
</p>
<p>Alliance came forth as the one body fortified
</p>
<p>for the emergency and fully decided as to the
</p>
<p>course it should pursue. The president of the
</p>
<p>Alliance at once sent an appeal to "all those
</p>
<p>who had studied in German universities" to in-
</p>

</p>
<p>augurate a propaganda "on behalf of the Ger-
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 93
</p>
<p>man cause." He closed the appeal with the sig-
</p>
<p>nificant words :
</p>
<p>I have learned from a responsible source
</p>
<p>that in the event that England is defeated an
</p>
<p>attempt will be made to draw the United
</p>
<p>States into an alliance with England. There-
</p>
<p>fore, it is important at the very outset to
</p>
<p>show what a colossal power the citizens of
</p>
<p>German descent are able to wield.
</p>
<p>A flood of light would certainly be shed upon
</p>
<p>the subsequent propaganda in the United
</p>
<p>States if the "responsible source" indicated by
</p>
<p>the head of the Alliance were disclosed.
</p>
<p>The time had come to use the educational
</p>
<p>prestige which Germany had been cultivating
</p>
<p>for so many years. In September "the Univer-
</p>
<p>sities of the German Empire" sent their ap-
</p>
<p>peal to the "Universities of Foreign Lands"
</p>
<p>in protest against the reports of German bar-
</p>
<p>barities. Then came the "Appeal to the Civi-
</p>
<p>lised World" signed by the professors of Ger-
</p>
<p>many, with the reiterated "it is not true."
</p>
<p>"It is not true," the appeal read, "that Ger-
</p>
<p>many brought on the war. ... It is not true
</p>
<p>that we ruthlessly violated the neutrality of

<p>Belgium. ... It is not true that either the life
</p>
<p>94 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>or the property of a single Belgian civilian has
</p>
<p>been touched by our soldiers except out of most
</p>
<p>bitter necessity. ... It is not true that our
</p>
<p>troops were guilty of brutalities in Louvain.
</p>
<p>. . . It is not true that our warfare is violating
</p>
<p>the rules of international law. ... It is not
</p>
<p>true that the war against so-called militarism
</p>
<p>is not a war against our Kultur, as our enemies
</p>
<p>hypocritically assert. . . . Believe us! Be-
</p>
<p>lieve that we will fight this war to its conclu-
</p>
<p>sion as a civilised people, a people to whom the
</p>
<p>heritage of a Goethe, of a Beethoven, and of
</p>
<p>a Kant is just as sacred as its hearth and lin-
</p>
<p>tel!"
</p>
<p>The Jena professors, Haeckel and Eucken,
</p>
<p>sent an open letter to their colleagues and ad-
</p>
<p>mirers denouncing Great Britain for fighting
</p>
<p>on the side of Russia, declaring that Russia
</p>
<p>was responsible for beginning the war in that
</p>
<p>she refused prompt and adequate punishment
</p>
<p>for a miserable assassination, imputing to
</p>
<p>Great Britain envy as her motive and ridiculing
</p>
<p>as a hypocritical pharisaism the British claim
</p>
<p>that the violation of Belgian neutrality had
</p>
<p>brought them into the war.

</p>
<p>Finally, the gymnasium instructors issued
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 95
</p>
<p>their manifesto: "It fills us with indignation
</p>
<p>that the enemies of Germany, with England at
</p>
<p>their head, ostensibly in our favour, make a
</p>
<p>distinction between the spirit of German
</p>
<p>science and the spirit of what they call Prus-
</p>
<p>sian militarism. In the German army there is
</p>
<p>no different spirit from that which prevails in
</p>
<p>the German people, for both are the same, and
</p>
<p>we also belong thereto. . . . Our belief is that
</p>
<p>the entire culture of Europe depends for its
</p>
<p>welfare on the victory which German militar-
</p>
<p>ism will win through the valour and faithful-
</p>
<p>ness of our men and through the sacrifice of
</p>
<p>the free and united German people." The only
</p>
<p>trouble with all these declarations was that
</p>
<p>they proved too much  the identification of
</p>
<p>German science and Kultur with Prussian mili-
</p>
<p>tarism has proved to be only too accurate 
</p>
<p>German education, German science and Kultur
</p>
<p>were long since made part of the military ma-
</p>
<p>chine, and submission to one meant, ultimately,
</p>
<p>complete and hopeless submission to the other.
</p>
<p>However, ubiquitous German agents in the
</p>
<p>United States quickly herded German sym-
</p>
<p>pathisers and the dupes of Kultur into organ-

<p>isations with high sounding names.
</p>
<p>96 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>It has been found that whenever a move-
</p>
<p>ment offered possibilities of usefulness to Ger-
</p>
<p>many, a German agent has been on hand to
</p>
<p>offer gratuitous service, advice, guidance, and
</p>
<p>even financial assistance. This was true of the
</p>
<p>organisation known as "Labour's National
</p>
<p>Peace Council" and its connection with the no-
</p>
<p>torious international crook and spy von Rin-
</p>
<p>telen; of the "Friends of Peace" and their or-
</p>
<p>ganiser, Albert Sander, who turned out to be
</p>
<p>a German spy; of the San Francisco organisa-
</p>
<p>tion known as the "Friends of Peace and Neu-
</p>
<p>trality" and their secretary who happened to
</p>
<p>be in the pay of the German government; of
</p>
<p>the "American Embargo Conference"; of the
</p>
<p>"Women's League for Strict Neutrality" 
</p>
<p>and many others. And this was true of the
</p>
<p>organisation of university men now formed.
</p>
<p>In November there was held in New York a
</p>
<p>gathering of old German students for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of devising ways and means of assisting
</p>
<p>their colleagues in the war. It was the general
</p>
<p>opinion that something more must be done than
</p>
<p>merely to raise funds for the relief of suffer-
</p>
<p>ing  the righteousness of Germany's cause

</p>
<p>must be presented to the American people.
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 97
</p>
<p>So there came to be formed the German
</p>
<p>University League with professors from Co-
</p>
<p>lumbia, Chicago, Princeton, Vanderbilt, Brown
</p>
<p>and many other institutions on its board of
</p>
<p>trustees and in its list of sponsors. The aca-
</p>
<p>demic world of America was to be the field of
</p>
<p>its propaganda. In Germany it related itself
</p>
<p>to "The League of German Scholars and Ar-
</p>
<p>tists"  in America it affiliated itself with the
</p>
<p>Inter-Collegiate League of German Clubs. No
</p>
<p>sooner was the organisation perfected than a
</p>
<p>German agent was on hand offering his serv-
</p>
<p>ices as secretary free of all expense  and the
</p>
<p>man continued as the executive head of the
</p>
<p>League until his arrest and internment in De-
</p>
<p>cember, 19 1 7.
</p>
<p>Through pamphlets, lectures and corre-
</p>
<p>spondence, the League aimed to enlist the sym-
</p>
<p>pathies of university and college instructors.
</p>
<p>But it went further than this. Like other pro-
</p>
<p>German organisations, it sought to create the
</p>
<p>impression that it represented, more truly than
</p>
<p>the administration, the American people, and
</p>
<p>thus to turn the sharp edge of our diplomacy.

</p>
<p>mising terms of which the English language is
</p>
<p>capable, the torpedoing of the Sussex and Ger-
</p>
<p>many's entire submarine warfare, the League
</p>
<p>took upon itself to neutralise the effect of the
</p>
<p>note by sending a wireless message to Rec-
</p>
<p>tor Dr. Ulrich von Wilamowitz Moellendorf,
</p>
<p>of Friedrich Wilhelm University, Berlin. This
</p>
<p>is what these self-constituted spokesmen for
</p>
<p>the American people said :
</p>
<p>We, citizens of the United States, Trus-
</p>
<p>tees of the German University League of
</p>
<p>America, wish to express to your magnifi-
</p>
<p>cence our strong desire to see peace pre-
</p>
<p>served between the United States and Ger-
</p>
<p>many. Knowing both countries well, we
</p>
<p>fear that Germany may interpret the mes-
</p>
<p>sage of our President as a provocation, some-
</p>
<p>thing surely not intended. On the contrary,
</p>
<p>we are convinced that the majority of the
</p>
<p>American people wish to have the relations
</p>
<p>of amity maintained, which have always ex-

<p>take a firm stand for fear of an insurrection
</p>
<p>of its German and pro-German elements.
</p>
<p>Early in the war the Germanistic societies
</p>
<p>were summoned to do their share. The so-
</p>
<p>ciety of Chicago issued several pamphlets fa-
</p>
<p>vouring the German cause, and its work was
</p>
<p>duly acknowledged in the Fatherland. The
</p>
<p>New York society, however, failed to respond,
</p>
<p>and the pro-German members were urged to
</p>
<p>oust the delinquent officers and turn the or-
</p>
<p>ganisation to some account. American ex-
</p>
<p>change professors were called upon to uphold
</p>
<p>Germany's cause, and several of them toured
</p>
<p>the country in that behalf, speaking under the
</p>
<p>auspices of historical societies, neutrality

<p>Wisconsin, and Eugene Kuehnemann, who had
</p>
<p>100 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>held the same professorships, devoted them-
</p>
<p>selves unremittingly to propaganda work.
</p>
<p>Professors of German birth in American
</p>
<p>universities made no secret of their partisan-
</p>
<p>ship and many used their class rooms for prop-
</p>
<p>aganda purposes. They even carried their par-
</p>
<p>tisanship into their social relations. A former
</p>
<p>student visiting his Alma Mater called upon
</p>
<p>one of these gentlemen under whom he had
</p>
<p>studied in his college days. He was met by
</p>
<p>his former instructor with the typically Prus-
</p>
<p>sian rebuff that "he was not in the practice of
</p>
<p>receiving people whose sympathies were
</p>
<p>against Germany. ,, These professors were in
</p>
<p>certain cases used also by the German govern-
</p>
<p>ment to report the attitude of their colleagues.
</p>
<p>A professor at an eastern university happened
</p>
<p>to write to a former colleague in Germany ex-
</p>
<p>pressing his disapproval of German policies
</p>
<p>and of Germany's conduct of the war. Several
</p>
<p>months later his letter, having passed through
</p>
<p>the Berlin foreign office and through the Ger-
</p>
<p>man embassy in Washington, was presented
</p>
<p>to the President of the University by a mem-
</p>
<p>ber of the German department and the demand

</p>
<p>was made that the offending colleague be dis-
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 101
</p>
<p>ciplined. With shame be it recorded that the
</p>
<p>president of the University summoned the pro-
</p>
<p>fessor in question and warned him against giv-
</p>
<p>ing expression to "unneutral" sentiments.
</p>
<p>But the common sense of our people proved
</p>
<p>more trustworthy in its judgment than the
</p>
<p>brains of our intellectuals. The rape of Bel-
</p>
<p>gium and the crime of the Lusitania could not
</p>
<p>be excused or condoned by any sophistry. As
</p>
<p>time went on public sentiment swung more and
</p>
<p>more strongly to the side of the Allies. Any
</p>
<p>hope of a benevolent neutrality on the part of
</p>
<p>America vanished. "Is it for this," the Kaiser
</p>
<p>is reported to have exclaimed, "that I permit-
</p>
<p>ted myself to be bored by the lectures of those
</p>
<p>tiresome American professors !"
</p>
<p>The disappointment in academic circles was
</p>
<p>keen. "Right here," declared Eduard Meyer,
</p>
<p>"we thought we had won firm ground, both by
</p>
<p>the efforts of the Kaiser and of German diplo-
</p>
<p>mats, and by the ever increasing and more in-
</p>
<p>timate personal relationships which were per-
</p>
<p>mitted by our government in every possible
</p>
<p>means through the exchange of professors,

<p>scholars, orators and artists, through the
</p>
<p>102 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>friendly reception accorded to the thousands
</p>
<p>of Americans who visited Germany every year,
</p>
<p>as students in the universities and schools of
</p>
<p>music, as merchants and tourists. It seemed
</p>
<p>that the ground was prepared for such a rap-
</p>
<p>prochement through the opposition between
</p>
<p>England and America dating from the days of
</p>
<p>the Revolutionary War." And his conclusion
</p>
<p>is that: "We can compel the Americans to
</p>
<p>respect us through our successes, but more we
</p>
<p>cannot do and we must not try to do it, if we
</p>
<p>respect ourselves and if we do not wish to

<p>injure again our prestige in the world, as we
</p>
<p>did in the last decade through our efforts for
</p>
<p>the favour of America and of other foreign
</p>
<p>nations in altogether too great a measure. For
</p>
<p>this reason also the exchange professorships
</p>
<p>which were introduced by the government
</p>
<p>against the desire of the universities over a
</p>
<p>decade ago at Harvard and at Columbia should
</p>
<p>be discontinued, since these universities have
</p>
<p>made their unfriendly attitude so plain; and if

<p>no German scholar will lower himself to the

<p>Herman Oncken, some time professor at the

<p>V
</p>
<p>NEW IDEALS IN AMERICAN
</p>
<p>EDUCATION
</p>
<p>For the present, America has shaken off the
</p>
<p>toils of the German conspiracy. In the light
</p>
<p>of our awakening, text books have been ex-
</p>
<p>amined and condemned: Chicago tore from
</p>
<p>her speller the offending allusion to the Kaiser
</p>
<p>whose perjured adulation so long disgraced
</p>
<p>her school rooms. New York placed most of
</p>
<p>the text books of German instruction upon the
</p>
<p>index. From the universities there has been
</p>
<p>a steady exodus of those whose efforts were
</p>
<p>in the interest of the German cause rather than
</p>
<p>in the interest of education.
</p>
<p>But let us not delude ourselves into thinking
</p>
<p>that German propaganda has been extirpated.
</p>
<p>Before the hot blast of public indignation it
</p>
<p>went under cover, merely to await its oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity. That opportunity has now come.

</p>
<p>With the signing of the Armistice the strain
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 105
</p>
<p>of war has been relaxed, and public opinion,
</p>
<p>until recently concentrated upon attaining an
</p>
<p>overwhelming victory, is again disintegrating.
</p>
<p>The nation followed unquestioningly the lead-
</p>
<p>ership of the President in the prosecution of
</p>
<p>the war against Germany  now that hostili-
</p>
<p>ties have been suspended, the terms of peace
</p>
<p>are slipping into the arena of public debate
</p>
<p>and into the field of practical politics. The
</p>
<p>pro-German agitator, the German agent, the
</p>
<p>spy, the radical socialist, the Bolshevist and
</p>
<p>others who use camouflaged theories only to
</p>
<p>mask their true purposes, are again lifting
</p>
<p>their heads. Again politicians are cautiously
</p>
<p>placating the "German vote" for private gain.
</p>
<p>Unless the nation maintains its vigilance and
</p>
<p>is as single-minded in its peace aims as in the
</p>
<p>prosecution of the war, the sacrifices of the
</p>
<p>last four years may prove to be merely the in-
</p>
<p>troduction to an even greater tragedy in the
</p>
<p>future.
</p>
<p>Every college campus in the country has
</p>
<p>been turned into a drill field. But the citizen

<p>soldier must be trained in mind and morale
</p>
<p>as well as in physique, and our education must

<p>take account of this, its largest responsibility.
</p>
<p>106 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>We must insist that every boy and every girl
</p>
<p>be brought up with a knowledge of the origins
</p>
<p>and nature of our society. This has been our
</p>
<p>obvious failure in the past. Over the princi-
</p>
<p>pal gateway of the nation's capital are in-
</p>
<p>scribed the words : "He that would bring home
</p>
<p>the wealth of the Indies must carry the wealth
</p>
<p>of the Indies with him; so it is with travelling.
</p>
<p>A man must carry knowledge with him if he
</p>
<p>would bring home knowledge/' Had the thou-
</p>
<p>sands of young men who during the past forty
</p>
<p>years have entered German universities heeded
</p>
<p>this counsel, they would have realised that the
</p>
<p>threat against democracy did not begin on
</p>
<p>April 2, 191 7, that it did not begin with the
</p>
<p>assassination of the Lusitania, nor with the
</p>
<p>rape of Belgium ; they would have divined the
</p>
<p>truth from all that they saw in Germany that
</p>
<p>the threat of autocracy began with the suppres-
</p>
<p>sion of the liberal movement in 1848, and that
</p>
<p>from that date the threat became more men-
</p>
<p>acing year by year. Instead, they fell into tKe
</p>
<p>goose-step of Kultur, without realising whither
</p>
<p>the march was directed. They brought back

<p>valuable knowledge of the methods of minute
</p>
<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 107
</p>
<p>research but their capacity for broader vision
</p>
<p>was hopelessly atrophied.
</p>
<p>Instruction in the German language may be
</p>
<p>appropriate for the technician and the scientist,
</p>
<p>but it should never again be permitted in the
</p>
<p>elementary or high schools. We may well take
</p>
<p>a leaf from the science of philology as de-
</p>
<p>veloped in Germany; a nation's life, so German
</p>
<p>scientists have taught, is embodied in its speech.
</p>
<p>Applying this conclusion we find that the ideas
</p>
<p>which are fundamental in our institutions can-
</p>
<p>not be translated into modern German. Let
</p>
<p>any one who doubts this statement attempt to
</p>
<p>render into the Kaiser's language the second
</p>
<p>paragraph of the Declaration of Independence;
</p>
<p>he will find no equivalents for such expressions
</p>
<p>as 'liberty," "pursuit of happiness," "the con-
</p>
<p>sent of the governed." Nor can he find in the
</p>
<p>German language a means for adequately ex-
</p>
<p>pressing the concluding sentence in which the
</p>
<p>authors pledge to each other "their lives, their
</p>
<p>fortunes and their sacred honour." When
</p>
<p>Professor Gneist wrote his work on "Self-Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment" he searched for a German equivalent
</p>
<p>for that concept. He could find none, and

<p>treatise with the English expression, and
</p>
<p>wherever the idea comes up in the discussion,
</p>
<p>the English words are used without any at-
</p>
<p>tempt at translation. And to-day, when em-
</p>
<p>perors, kings and princes are fleeing before the
</p>
<p>wrath of their subjects, the Marseillaise is
</p>
<p>being sung in Berlin and in Vienna ! The ideas
</p>
<p>of individual liberty developed through the his-
</p>
<p>tory of England, France and America have so
</p>
<p>long encountered a blank spot in the German
</p>
<p>brain that there is in the language no medium
</p>
<p>for their expression. No man of German de-
</p>
<p>scent can become thoroughly American while
</p>
<p>retaining allegiance to the German language;
</p>
<p>no man of any race can become an American
</p>
<p>at heart until he seeks to make the English
</p>
<p>language not merely the language of his busi-
</p>
<p>ness, but also of his fireside.
</p>
<p>All this is said with a due appreciation for

<p>the treasures of German literature. But the

<p>associations of the German language with the

<p>atrocities of the war are such that the world
</p>
<p>can never again enjoy the German classics until

<p>of the tragedies for which the instigators of

<p>IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 109
</p>
<p>the war must answer ! When finally we have
</p>
<p>placed the German language on the road to ex-
</p>
<p>tinction as a political and commercial medium,
</p>
<p>then we will return and bring our tribute to
</p>
<p>Schiller, Goethe and Lessing, well knowing
</p>
<p>that those great spirits, if present with us to-
</p>
<p>day, would require that we do that very thing.
</p>
<p>And here we come upon the question of the
</p>
<p>foreign language press. Even with the best of
</p>
<p>intentions on the part of editors of individual
</p>
<p>newspapers, still the interests of this press as
</p>
<p>a whole are opposed to the progress of Ameri-
</p>
<p>canisation. It is urged that foreign language
</p>
<p>publications perform a valuable function in
</p>
<p>mediating between the immigrant and his new
</p>
<p>environment and in preparing him for citizen-
</p>
<p>ship. Let this be granted. But if the immi-
</p>
<p>grant makes any progress whatever in Ameri-
</p>
<p>canisation, if he acquires a knowledge of the
</p>
<p>English language, then he prefers the broader
</p>
<p>outlook afforded by the American press. The
</p>
<p>foreign language newspaper loses his patron-
</p>
<p>age. For this very reason the foreign lan-
</p>
<p>guage press is constantly insisting that the im-
</p>

<p>opposed every measure which would require a

<p>knowledge of English as a requisite for nat-
</p>
<p>uralisation or for the exercise of the franchise.
</p>
<p>In this respect the German language news-
</p>
<p>papers have been the most rabid offenders.
</p>
<p>The position of the foreign language news-
</p>
<p>papers is precarious at best. It is only by the
</p>
<p>utmost exertions that they can maintain their
</p>
<p>circulations. They are constantly faced with
</p>
<p>financial difficulties. This condition renders
</p>
<p>them particularly susceptible to temptation and
</p>
<p>they fall an easy prey to politicians, propagan-
</p>
<p>dists or other interests that can offer a bonus
</p>
<p>for whatever influence they may possess. Wit-
</p>
<p>ness the eagerness with which four hundred
</p>
<p>foreign language editors in April, 1915, sub-
</p>
<p>scribed and published Dr. Albert's plea for an
</p>
<p>embargo on munitions, all at exceedingly lib-
</p>
<p>eral advertising rates! Witness their con-

<p>stant diatribes against prohibition "on moral

<p>grounds," and at the same time their itching
</p>
<p>importunity for a share in the brewers' slush

</p>
<p>ers of the German movement in America have
</p>
<p>always insisted, but that he become American

<p>in language, thought and spirit. One of the
</p>
<p>conditions for the settlement of Europe's tur-

<p>moil is to be the self-determination of nation-

<p>alities. While we are demanding self-determi-

<p>nation for Jugo-Slavs, Poles, Lithuanians,
</p>
<p>Czecho-Slovaks and Finns we have at least the
</p>
<p>right to demand self-determination for Amer-

<p>ica. And it is only through Americanisation
</p>
<p>that we can create the unity of spirit and the
</p>
<p>morale which will be needed to weather the tur-
</p>
<p>moil of the coming years when Central Eu-
</p>
<p>rope, breaking from the past, will become the
</p>
<p>whirlpool of Bolshevism and of every other
</p>
<p>frenzy which refuses to recognise organic de-

<p>velopment. Already the waves have broken

<p>over our borders ; they will rise higher and lash

<p>make it so. We have too long proceeded upon
</p>
<p>112 THE GERMAN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>the erroneous assumption that our history be-
</p>
<p>gan with the Declaration of Independence, or
</p>
<p>with the landing of the Pilgrim Fathers, or
</p>
<p>even with the discovery of our continent. We
</p>
<p>have wilfully separated ourselves from the tap-
</p>
<p>root of our existence, which reaches far back
</p>
<p>into the fertile soil of English literature and
</p>
<p>English history. Many of our German-trained
</p>
<p>educators have felt the need of a deeper nour-
</p>
<p>ishment, and mesmerised by the prestidigita-
</p>
<p>tions of Kultur, have attempted the violent
</p>
<p>process of grafting us upon a German stock.
</p>
<p>We know now that we could not have survived
</p>
<p>such a process. It would have resulted in chok-
</p>
<p>ing out everything that is American and in pro-
</p>
<p>ducing a ranker and a more noxious growth of
</p>
<p>Kultur. We must go back to the sources of
</p>
<p>our history; we are the descendants of those
</p>
<p>who landed on the Isle of Thanet; King Alfred
</p>
<p>and the Barons of Runnymede belong to us ; we
</p>
<p>claim our share in the glories of English dis-
</p>
<p>covery and in the defeat of the Armada;
