</p>
<p>NOT ^ BY TH  IM BLISHERS.
</p>
<p>Events of the past few years have demonstrated the existence of an organized
</p>
<p>effort to make important changes in the Government of the United States ; not in
</p>
<p>the legitimate manner provided by the Constitution, but insidiously, stealthily at
</p>
<p>first, growing bolder by degrees, and at length when circumstances seemed to
</p>
<p>warrant immunity from personal danger, unblushingly avowed, by the less cautious
</p>
<p>aiders and abettors of the treasonable .work.
</p>
<p>In the accompanying pages, the author, in a clear, logical, and eloquent manner,
</p>
<p>has grouped numerous startling proofs, and from these argued the case with un-
</p>
<p>usual abihty and fairness, and shown that the charge of "conspiracy" is justly
</p>
<p>applied. But while clear proof is given of a cherished purpose, long entertained,
</p>
<p>to subvert the Constitution by perverting and destroying its plainest provisions,
</p>
<p>it does not appear that the design has ever been openly announced with a view of
</p>
<p>bringing it distinctly and boldly to the notice of the public. On the contrary,
</p>
<p>when charged with aiming at the subversion of the Government, the answer has
</p>
<p>been that their purpose was not to destroy, but to save it.
</p>
<p>Meantime, a large portion of the people, not understanding the questions at issue,
</p>
<p>have been unable to discriminate between the real friends of liberty and law, and
</p>
<p>the secret enemies of both. The crime planned and attempted, has been greater
</p>
<p>in magnitude and in its contemplated result, than they were prepared to believe
</p>
<p>possible. Hence, when the charge has been made and repeated, many have re-
</p>
<p>garded it as one of those extravagant accusations which frequently arise from
</p>
<p>partisan asperity. But the people are becoming hourly more enlightened upon
</p>
<p>those subjects which enable them to appreciate the contemplated wrong, and they
</p>
<p>have resolved to know the whole truth of the matter. A severe inquisition will
</p>
<p>probe this question to the lieart. The real conspirators will be known, and will
</p>
<p>receive the merited rewards of their deeds.
</p>
<p>Most respectfully, but earnestly, we urge upon every champion of the Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion, every friend of civil liberty, to lend his indivdiual influence zealously in the
</p>
<p>circulation of this most valuable document. Nothing to be compared with it for
</p>
<p>immediate and imjwrtant effect has yet appeared. One hundred thousand
</p>
<p>copies, at least, should be in the hands of the people before the Sth of Novem-
</p>
<p>ber. Contributions to this object may bo sent to the publishers, and all funds
</p>
<p>furnished for this purpose, will be immediately used in the gratuitous distribution
</p>
<p>of the pamphlet J. W. & CO.

<p>New Yobk, October, 10, 1864.
</p>
<p>"TO ALL WHOM IT MAY CONCERN."
</p>
<p>At no other period' since the morninj? of liberty (hiwned upon this
</p>
<p>favored land, has it been so manifestly the duty of the people to discard par-
</p>
<p>tisan bias, and all those potent influences which distract and mislead the
</p>
<p>judgment ; in order that calmness, soberness, solemnity, and earnestness,
</p>
<p>may characterize reflection, discussion, and action ; for by theSe influ-
</p>
<p>ences alone can our country be saved from certain, speedy, and irretriev-
</p>
<p>able ruin. In the halcyon days of the Republic, those good old days of
</p>
<p>" Virtue, Liberty, and Independence," the political questions which
</p>
<p>engaged the attention of the people were multifarious. Questions of
</p>
<p>revenue, of finance, the improvement of harbors and rivers ; the distribu-
</p>
<p>tion of the proceeds of public lands among the States, and the occupa-
</p>
<p>tion of those lands by the sturdy pioneer.
</p>
<p>My fellow-countrymen, these questions, and many others of like import,
</p>
<p>were once regarded as possessing vital inrferest for the people of our
</p>
<p>common country. Alas ! They no longer possess an interest for you.
</p>
<p>As when a great calamity casts its gloomy shadow over our individual
</p>
<p>household, all minor evils are forgotten in the anxiety occasioned by the
</p>
<p>one overwhelming affliction, so this unspeakable calamity which has
</p>
<p>visited our national household has driven from our minds all thought of
</p>
<p>those legitimate governmental questions, whose very discussion was the
</p>
<p>best indication of peace, contentment, happiness, and prosperity, such as
</p>
<p>no other people under the broad canopy of heaven were ever permitted to
</p>
<p>enjoy. No, my countrymen  no ! one question alone is worthy of your
</p>
<p>deliberation now. It is a question that freemen are asking one of an-
</p>
<p>other with kindling eye and throbbing heart, What CAN BE DONE TO
</p>
<p>RESCUE FROM THE GRASP OF DESPOTIC POWER THE PRICELESS JEWEL
</p>
<p>OF CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTY ? This is the vital question, that towers in
</p>
<p>colossal proportions above all others. You, citizens of America, upon
</p>
<p>the solemn responsibility which you owe, not alone to yourselves, but to
</p>
<p>latest posterity, must answer on the eighth of November next. Let me
</p>
<p>adjure you to remember that upon the response which you shall make, is
</p>
<p>involved all that can make life desirable to an American citizen.
</p>
<p>Let us, then, Freemen of America, resolve by all the inspiring memories
</p>
<p>of the past, by all the imperilled interests of the present, by all our anxious

<p>hopes in the future, that the Constitution, the laws, and the Union of
</p>
<p>these States shall be maintained and defended against treason, in every
</p>
<p>form, whether it be arrayed under the flaunting banner of Southern
</p>
<p>secession, or under the atrocious and contemptible, because insidi-
</p>
<p>ous and cowardly black flag of Northern Abolitionism.
</p>
<p>4 " TO ALL WHOM IT MAY CONCERN."
</p>
<p>Is it not amazing that so many of the honest yeomanry of the country
</p>
<p>can be so blinded by party prejudice, so trammelled by party discipline as
</p>
<p>still to array themselves under a banner that for thirty years has had em-
</p>
<p>blazoned upon its folds, in characters so plain that none need misunder-
</p>
<p>stand, those very doctrines of disunion and discord, which ai*e now so
</p>
<p>falsely charged upon the Democracy of the country ? Yet, so it is,  a
</p>
<p>lamentable fact. Although the rank and file of all political organizations
</p>
<p>are honest and well meaning, they are liable to be cajoled and misled by
</p>
<p>wily, selfish, and unscrupulous demagogues, made willing victims of their
</p>
<p>own destruction.
</p>
<p>While history records some examples of voluntary surrender of liberty
</p>
<p>by the people, under the baleful teachings of artful, ambitious men, its
</p>
<p>pages will be searched in vain for a parallel to that self-stultification,
</p>
<p>moral blindness, prejudice, fanaticism, or by whatsoever name it may be
</p>
<p>called, through whose maddening influence a large portion of the free
</p>
<p>citizens of this enlightened and most favored land, are, at this very mo-
</p>
<p>ment, deliberately riveting the manacles of despotism upon their own free
</p>
<p>limbs.
</p>
<p>I most respectfully entreat every fair-minded and reasonable Eepub-
</p>
<p>lican to suspend for a brief season those partisan prejudices which blind-
</p>
<p>fold him to the light of reason, and render him deaf to the voice of fair
</p>
<p>discussion. I care not to appeal to the passions of men. I prefer to ad-
</p>
<p>dress myself to their honest, sober reflections. Unless, indeed, it may
</p>
<p>be said,
</p>
<p>"O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts.
</p>
<p>And men have lost their reason I"
</p>
<p>Words of wisdom seem to be lost amid the shrieking whirlwind of pas-
</p>
<p>sion, the tread of marshalled hosts, the clash of glittering steel, the dis-
</p>
<p>cordant bellowing of ponderous artillery, and the crackling embers of
</p>
<p>conflagrated cities ; and when at length " some dreary pause between,"
</p>
<p>and sympathizing Night has cast her dusky mantle over the horror of
</p>
<p>these scenes, hark ! another sound, more terrible than the din of battle,
</p>
<p>breaks upon the stillness of the midnight hour. Alas ! for that wail of
</p>
<p>anguish whose woful cadence, rising from fields of carnage, is floated to

</p>
<p>every cottage and mountain-home throughout the broad area of this once
</p>
<p>bright and peerless, now bleeding and disti-acted land.
</p>
<p>Let us then, in the first place, endeavor to brush away the cobwebs
</p>
<p>which the spider, Abolition, has woven about the eyelids of so many con-
</p>
<p>servative and well-meaning men, in order that they may be enlightened
</p>
<p>in regard to some, at least, of the numerous heresies of the Republican
</p>
<p>creed : prominent among which, and perhaps the most mischievous, is
</p>
<p>that of confounding the Administration of the Government with the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment itst'lf. This is a cardinal error, and betrays a misapprehension
</p>
<p>of the true theory of our governmental structure. A little reflection, un-
</p>
<p>biased by party zeal, would reveal the nakedness of this fallacy.
</p>
<p>Republicans clamor for an unconditional support of the Government,
</p>
<p>meaning the Administration. Democrats contend for an unconditional
</p>
<p>support of the Government, meaning the Constitution and the laws.
</p>
<p>"to all whom it may concern. 5
</p>
<p>Republicans arguo that the Adiiunistratioii, for tlui time Ix'iiif^, in the
</p>
<p>Goveniincnt. Di'iiiocrats tleuy the correctness of this proposition.
</p>
<p>I hohl as an axiom, that the Constitution of tiie United States, einlx. dy-
</p>
<p>ing in its provisions tlie will of the soveurion I'koI'LK is, ^^er tte. the
</p>
<p>Oovernment of tlie United States. That Constitution i)r(>vides for its own
</p>
<p>administration in the election by the people of agents, with power to
</p>
<p>those agents to appoint subordinates. The official titles of said principal
</p>
<p>agents, their terms of office, their duties and their salaries, being fixed
</p>
<p>and designated hy the people in their Constitution. And whenever, and
</p>
<p>by whomsoever, addition to or subtraction from that fundamental law is
</p>
<p>attempted, in ever so minute a degree  save in the* manner written and
</p>
<p>provided therein ; or whenever or by whomsoever another law is attempt-
</p>
<p>ed to be substituted for this supreme law, the person or persons so oft'end-
</p>
<p>ing are guilty of, at least, moral treason to the Govennnent of the United
</p>
<p>States.
</p>
<p>How natural that the author of the "Higher Law" doctrine, should
</p>
<p>also be the author of the following words, addressed to Lord Lyons in
</p>
<p>November, 1861 :
</p>
<p>" My Lord, I can touch a bell on my right hand, and order the arrest
</p>
<p>of a citizen of Ohio; I can touch the bell again, and order the irnprison-
</p>
<p>ment of a citizen of New York; and no power on earth, except that of
</p>
<p>the President, can release them. Can the Queen of England do so
</p>
<p>much .'"
</p>
<p>I wonder if it did not occur to Lord Lyons, when these precious words
</p>
<p>were uttered, that it might have been better for those '^citizens of Ohio
</p>
<p>and New York," had their forefathers been content to remain subjects of
</p>
<p>King George the Third. The Queen of England certainly cannot "do
</p>
<p>so much." There are but few Despots in the world who would dare " do
</p>
<p>so much." Perhaps the Empires of Japan and China, the dominions of
</p>
<p>the Sultan of Turkey, the King of Dahomey, and the United Stales of
</p>
<p>America ! are the only Governments within whose realms there can be
</p>
<p>done " so much." What higher claim has any De.spot ever advanced
</p>
<p>than the unconditional support of his subjects ? The difference between
</p>
<p>a Despotism and a Kepublic is in this : that while a Despot claims uncon-

</p>
<p>ditional obedience from the peojile to his will ; in a Uepublic like ours,
</p>
<p>the sovereign people demand unconditional obedience from tlu^ir agent to
</p>
<p>their (the people's) will, as expressed in their written Constitution.
</p>
<p>To admit that unconditional allegiance is due from the people to the
</p>
<p>Administration, of their own creation, is to admit that the people resign
</p>
<p>their sovereignty to the Administration ; and inasmuch as there has been
</p>
<p>no interregnum between the expiration of one Administration and the
</p>
<p>commencement of another, it follows, as a logical deduction (according
</p>
<p>to the theory of the Republicans) that ever since the election of General
</p>
<p>Washington, we have been merely the subjects of a long line of sove-
</p>
<p>reign Administrations! Our familiar vaunt, "tlie sovereign people," has
</p>
<p>been a shallow pretence  a delusion.
</p>
<p>If the Republican theory be correct, then I admit I have no right, save
</p>
<p>by permission of my sovereign, to write this address, or, persisting in so
</p>
<p>6 ''TO ALL ^Y^OM IT MAY CONCERN."
</p>
<p>doing, I shall have no right to complain if the iron gripe which Despots
</p>
<p>usually fasten on the throats of those who defy their authority, should
</p>
<p>clutch at mine.
</p>
<p>This is certainly an important consideration, and worthy of the most seri-
</p>
<p>ous reflection of every citizen, whether Republican or Democrat, who here-
</p>
<p>tofore lias indulged the belief that he was one of the SOVEREIGN people.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, let us turn over a few pages of familiar history. Seventy-
</p>
<p>seven years ago, on the 17th of September, that matchless work of wis-
</p>
<p>dom, the Federal Constitution, perfect in all its proportions, came forth
</p>
<p>from the hands of its creatoi'S. Go with me, in memory, to the city of
</p>
<p>Philadelphia, on the 14th of May, 1787. On that day, there assembled
</p>
<p>in the now venerable Hall of Independence, a Convention, composed of
</p>
<p>men whose names are written in characters of flame on the scroll of im-
</p>
<p>mortality ; whose glorious deeds deserve to be recorded on the tablet of
</p>
<p>every freeman's heart. From the 14th of May to the 17th of September,
</p>
<p>those sages were engaged in earnest, prayerful deliberation ; and what
</p>
<p>was the burden of their anxiety during all those months ?
</p>
<p>You, my countrymen, each individual of you  your happiness and
</p>
<p>mine  your liberties and mine ! The great problem to be solved was the
</p>
<p>construction of a coufederative system of Governmeiit, while yet pre-
</p>
<p>serving, in perfect distinctness aiid vigor, the sovereignty of each indi-
</p>
<p>vidual State ; in order thereby .to perpetuate to their latest posterity those
</p>
<p>inestimable political blessings, which, after seven long years of toil, of
</p>
<p>blood, of poverty, destitution, and horror, they had wrung from the tyrant
</p>
<p>of Britain. This was the grand problem, which, during that period, from
</p>
<p>May until September, claimed the God-like intellect, wisdom, and devo-
</p>
<p>tion of men clothed in the vesture of nature's nobility  heroes, patri-
</p>
<p>ots, sires  our fathers,  a race of men whom God will vouchsafe to the
</p>
<p>world but once.

<p>The peerless example for the study of mankind, created, as it were, to

</p>
<p>Yes, my fi-llow-countryincn, at tli<i portals <if tlic tonili of Wasliini^ton
</p>
<p>sits the genius of Liberty, State Sovereignty, and Union; and while thn
</p>
<p>echo of fratricidal artillery disturbs the silence of that halhtwed spot, let
</p>
<p>us invoke the lofty spirit of the Father of his country, to exorcise the
</p>
<p>demon of discord from the land he loved so well ; that hate, and passion,
</p>
<p>and wild fury, and fanaticism may flee the American heart, while love, and
</p>
<p>reason, and generous counsel, may animate to the great work of rescuing
</p>
<p>from everlasting ruin, the priceless legacy which he bequeathed to us.
</p>
<p>In transmitting to Congress a copy of the Constitution, and the resolu-
</p>
<p>tions of the Convention, recommending its submission to the States for
</p>
<p>ratification, George Washington, who performed that duty, thus wrote :
</p>
<p>"The Constitution which xve now present, is the result of a spirit of
</p>
<p>amity, and of that mutual deference and concession, which, the pecu-
</p>
<p>liarity of our political situation rendered indispensable. That it is liable
</p>
<p>to as few exceptions as could reasonably be expected, we hope and believe ;
</p>
<p>that it may promote the lasting welfare of that country so dear to us all,
</p>
<p>and secure her freedom and happiness is our most ardent wish,"
</p>
<p>In his immortal Farewell Address, he writes : V Hence, likewise, they
</p>
<p>will avoid the necessity of those overgrown military establinhments,
</p>
<p>which, under any form of government, are inauspicious to liberty, and
</p>
<p>which are to be regarded as particularly hostile to republican liberty.^'
</p>
<p>Again he writes in the same Address : " The bases of our political sys-
</p>
<p>tems, is the right of the people to make and alter their constitutions of
</p>
<p>government; but the Constitution, which at any time exists, till changed,
</p>
<p>by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people, is sacredly olfliga-
</p>
<p>tory upon all. The very idea of the power and the right of the people to
</p>
<p>establish government, presupposes the duty of every individual to obey
</p>
<p>the established government^
</p>
<p>Mark the language that Washington uses. It has been said that
</p>
<p>'''words are things;" General Washington does not use the singular
</p>
<p>noun base of our political system, but he employs the plural nouns bases,
</p>
<p>systems, and constitutions of Government. I repeat the sentence : " The
</p>
<p>bases of our political systems, is the right of the people to make and alter
</p>
<p>their constitutions of government," &u.

</p>
<p>Now, if Washington had written ten folio volumes, upon whose every
</p>
<p>page he had declared that the Federal government was the creature of the
</p>
<p>so ereign Stntes. and not that the States are creatures of the Federal
</p>
<p>government (which is the theory of the present Ilepublican party), he
</p>
<p>could not have more clearly and emphatically announced his opinion.
</p>
<p>Let it be observed, also, that he uses the words " constitution" and
</p>
<p>"government" synonymously, proving that he regarded the Constitution
</p>
<p>as the Government. Again he writes :
</p>
<p>"The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by
</p>
<p>the spirit of revenge, natural to pai'ty dissension, which, in ditlVrent ages
</p>
<p>and countries, has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a
</p>
<p>frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and per-
</p>
<p>manent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result, gradually
</p>
<p>incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power
</p>
<p>of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction,
</p>
<p>b "TO ALL WHOM IT MAY CONCERN.
</p>
<p>more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to
</p>
<p>the purposes of his own elevation on the iiuiNS OF public liberty. "
</p>
<p>*' It is important, likewise, that the hahits of thinking, in a free country,
</p>
<p>should inspire caution in those intrustid with its administration, to con-
</p>
<p>fine themstdves within tlieir respective constiiutioual spheres; avoiding,
</p>
<p>in the exercise of the powers of one department, to encroach upon another.
</p>
<p>The s[iirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the de-
</p>
<p>partments in one. and thus to create,  whateverthe form of government, 
</p>
<p>a real despotism. A just estimate of that love of power, and proneness
</p>
<p>to abuse it, which predominates in the human heart, is sufficient to satisfy
</p>
<p>us of the truth of this position." "If in the opinion of the people, the
</p>
<p>distribution or modification of the powers be in any particular wrong, let
</p>
<p>it be corrected by an amendment, in the way which the Constitution desig-
</p>
<p>nates. But let there be no change by usurpation, for though
</p>
<p>this, in one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary
</p>
<p>weapon, by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent must
</p>
<p>always greatly overbalance, in permanent evil, any partial or transient
</p>
<p>benefit which the use can, at any time, yield."
</p>
<p>In these extracts, you have Washington's opinion of the Constitution.
</p>
<p>Says James Madison, in his first inaugural address, delivered in 1809 :
</p>
<p>" Prefer in all cases, amicable discussion, and reasonable accommoda-
</p>
<p>tions of differences, to a decision of them by an appeal to arms ; to hold
</p>
<p>the Union of the States as the basis of their peace and happiness ; to sup-
</p>
<p>port the Constitution, which is the cement of the Union, as well in its
</p>
<p>limitations as in its authorities ; to respect the rights and authorities
</p>
<p>reserved to the States, and to the people, as equally incorporated with, and
</p>
<p>essential to the success of the general system ;" " to preserve in their full
</p>
<p>energy, the other salutary provisions, in behalf of private and personal
</p>
<p>rights, and of the freedom of the press." "Always remembering that an
</p>
<p>armed and trained MILITIA is the firmest bulwark of republics  that with-
</p>
<p>out standing ti/'mies, their liberty can never be in danger, NOR with large
</p>
<p>ones safe!"
</p>
<p>Said Thomas Jefi"erson, in his first inaugural, in 1801 :
</p>
<p>"All, too, will bear in mind this sacred principle, that though the will

</p>
<p>of the nmjority is, in all cases, to prevail, that will, to be rightful, must
</p>
<p>be reasonable ; that the minority possess their equal rights, which equal
</p>
<p>laws 7nmt protect, and to violate, would, be oppression." " And let us
</p>
<p>reflect, that, having banished from our land that religious intolerance un-
</p>
<p>der wliich mankind so long bled and suffered, we have yet gained little,
</p>
<p> if we countenance a political intolm-ance as despotic, as wicked, and
</p>
<p>capable of as bitter and bloody persecutions."
</p>
<p>Again, Mr. Jefferson writes :
</p>
<p>" The support of the State governments in all their rights, as the most
</p>
<p>competent administrations for our domestic concerns, and the surest bul-
</p>
<p>jwarks against anti-republican tendencies;'" "A JEALOUS care of the
</p>
<p>RIGHT of electidn bv THE PEOPLE. The supremacy of the civil over

<p>thu military authority, (economy in the public expense, that labor may
</p>
<p>be lightly burdened. Freedom of religion, freedom of the press, and
</p>
<p>freedom of person, under the protection of the habeas corpus, and trials
</p>
<p>by juri<-s impartially selected. These principles form the bright constel-
</p>
<p>lation which has gone Ijefore us, and guided our steps through an age of
</p>
<p>revoluli.Mi and reformation. The wisdom of our sages, and blood of our
</p>
<p>heine-, have been devoted U> their attainment; they should be the creed
</p>
<p>of our [x.litical faith, the text of civic instruction', the touchstone, by

</p>
<p>them in moments of error or ularin. let us liasteii to retrace our steps, uud
</p>
<p>to regain the road which alone leads to peace, liberty, and safety."
</p>
<p>Says Chief-Justice Story, a name universally esteemed, referring^ to
</p>
<p>the high responsibilities of the people, to prt-servc their Constituiiou from
</p>
<p>usurping power :
</p>
<p>" It must perish, if there be not that vital spirit in the people, which
</p>
<p>alone can nourish, sustain, and direct all its movements. It is in vain
</p>
<p>that Statesmen shall form plans of government, in whicli tlie hcautv and
</p>
<p>harmony of a republic shall be emb<idied in visibU- order, shall 1)^ built up
</p>
<p>on solid substructions, and adorned by every useful urnauu-nt, if the inliab-
</p>
<p>tauts suffer the silent power of time to dilapidate its walls, or crumble its
</p>
<p>massy supporters into dust; if the assaults from without are never re-
</p>
<p>sisted, and the rottenness and mining from within are never guarded
</p>
<p>against, who can preserve the riglits and lil)erties of the people, when
</p>
<p>they shall be abandoned by themselves? Who shall keep watch in the
</p>
<p>Temple, when the watchmen sleep at their posts? Who shall call on the
</p>
<p>people to redeem their possessions, and revive the republic, when their
</p>
<p>hands have deliberately and corruptly surrendered them to the oppressor,
</p>
<p>and have built the prisons, or dug the graves of their own friends ? Thia
</p>
<p>dark picture, it is to be hoped, will never be applicable to the Kepublic
</p>
<p>of America ; and yet it affords a warning, which, like all the lessons of
</p>
<p>past experience, we are not permitted to disregard ; America, free, happy,
</p>
<p>and enlightened as she is, must rest the preservation of her rights and
</p>
<p>liberties upon the virtue, independence, justice, and sagacity of the
</p>
<p>people. If either fail, the Republic is gone. Its shadow may remain
</p>
<p>with all the pomp, and circumstance, and trickery of government, but
</p>
<p>its vital power will have departed. In America, the dem^igogue may rise
</p>
<p>as well as elsewhere. He is the natural, though spurious growth of
</p>
<p>Republics; and, like the courtier, he may, by his blandishments, delude
</p>
<p>the ears and blind the eyes of the people, to their own destruction. If
</p>
<p>ever th(?* day shall arrive, in which the best talents and the best virtues
</p>
<p>shall be driven from office by intrigue or corruption, by the ostracism of the
</p>
<p>press, or the still more unrelenting persecution of party legislation, the

<p>GOVERNMENT will cease to be national. It will be wise by accident, and
</p>
<p>bad by sytem."
</p>
<p>Montesquieu declares that \
</p>
<p>'' The political liberty of the citizen is a tranquillity of mind, arising from
</p>
<p>the opinion each person has of his safety. The enjoyment of liberty, and
</p>
<p>even its support and preservation, consists in every man being allowed to
</p>
<p>speak his thoughts and lay open his sentiments."
</p>
<p>In a letter from that great statesman, Silas Wright, dated April 9,
</p>
<p>1847, he writes :
</p>
<p>*'No one familiar with the affairs of our Government can have failed to
</p>
<p>notice how largje a proportion of our statesmen appear never to have read
</p>
<p>the Constitution of the United States, with a careful reference to it>^ pre-
</p>
<p>cise language and exact procisions, but rather, as occasion presents, seem
</p>
<p>to exercise their ingenuity, unfortunately too often powerful and power-
</p>
<p>fully exerted to slretcn both to the line of what they at the moment con-
</p>
<p>sider EXPEDIENT."
</p>
<p>Said that enlightened statesman and scholar, John McPherson Berrien,
</p>
<p>of Georgia :
</p>
<p>10 " TO ALL WHOM IT MAY CONCERN."
</p>
<p>" A kiiowledi^e of tho Constitution, wliichis for the most part plain and
</p>
<p>simple in its provisions, would often enable the citizen to spurn indig-
</p>
<p>nantly the eftorts of demagogues to mislead him, and awaken hiui to a
</p>
<p>deeper sense of gratitude for the privileges which he is permitted to
</p>
<p>enjoy."
</p>
<p>On the 13th of February, 1847, George M. Dallas wrote these words :
</p>
<p>" It [the Constitution] should form the rudimental basis of American
</p>
<p>thought, by being made a perpetually recurring object of memory."
</p>
<p>I will conclude these quotations with one from the great expounder
</p>
<p>himself, though they might be continued almost indefinitely : on the 11th
</p>
<p>of December, 1850, Daniel \Vebster,_theu near the close of his useful life,
</p>
<p>thus wrote ;
</p>
<p>" The Constitution of the United States is a written instrument, a
</p>
<p>recoriied fundamental law ; it is the bond and the only bond of the Union
</p>
<p>of these States ; it is all that gives us a national character. Almost every
</p>
<p>man in the country is capable of reading it, and that which so deeply
</p>
<p>concerns all, should be made easily accessible to all."
</p>
<p>These are some of the recorded opinions of sages, statesmen, and phi-
</p>
<p>losophers, in relation to the Constitution of the United States  most of
</p>
<p>them Democrats. Now, let us look at the published opinions of the lead-
</p>
<p>ers of the abolitionized Republican party. Contrast is at least an artistic
</p>
<p>arrangement.
</p>
<p>Bear in mind, if ^ou please, that the Constitution must be accepted or
</p>
<p>rejected as a whole. It was so adopted, and not one line or syllable can
</p>
<p>be rejected without endangering the whole system of government, of
</p>
<p>which it is the life.
</p>
<p>The fourth article just as clearly recognizes the I'ight to hold pi'operty
</p>
<p>in slaves as the fifth article recognizes the right to alter and amend the
</p>
<p>instrument itself. One article is just as obligatory upon the people as
</p>
<p>another, and any person or persons who would endeavor to escape that
</p>
<p>obligation by setting up ** a higher law," a law of sentiment to be obeyed
</p>
<p>in preference to the Constitution, whenever its provisions conflict with
</p>
<p>their tender consciences, pi-ove themselves traitors to the Government of
</p>
<p>the United States. And this is the kind of treason that has produced

<p>this civil war, and deluged the land in fratricidal blood.
</p>
<p>I now deliberately charge the leaders of the so-called Republican, but
</p>
<p>really Ab<jlition party, with a premeditated conspiracy to destroy the
</p>
<p>Constitution of the United States, and per consequence, the American
</p>
<p>Union. Mark, I say, leaders of this party, for, as I have already
</p>
<p>remarked, the rank and file of one party are just as honest as those of
</p>
<p>the other, but deceived and betrayed. *
</p>
<p>Now, to the proof of this serious charge. In cases of capital crime cir-
</p>
<p>ouuihtantial evidence, where tho chain is unbroken, has been regarded by
</p>
<p>writers on criminal law as the safest kind of proof upon which to find a
</p>
<p>riglittious verdict. We have both circumstantial and positive evidence
</p>
<p>upon which to rest our case.
</p>
<p>Tlie nomination of Abraham Lincoln, at Chicago, was only one scene
</p>
<p>"to all whom it may oonckkx." 11
</p>
<p>in one act of this wicked iuul blondy dnima. Mniiv scciics ii;ivc Ihtii
</p>
<p>enacted since, hut like the phiy within tlie i>hiy, in the third net of Ham-
</p>
<p>let, there will, I apprehend, arise such an infernal coinniDtion anionf^ tlie
</p>
<p>audience that the conspirators will be driven in diseonifiture from the
</p>
<p>stage, appalled at the picture of their own diabolical murder. Said one
</p>
<p>of the high priests of their party, one who has received distinguished
</p>
<p>courtesies at the hands of the President while in Washington, and who
</p>
<p>was invited by a majority of the Senate to a seat on the floor of the Sen-
</p>
<p>ate Chamber; an honor rarely accorded, and only to those who have
</p>
<p>distinguished themselves in the service of their country, and to foreign
</p>
<p>Ambassadors  said Wendell Phillips :
</p>
<p>" The Constitution of our fathers was a mistake. Tear it to piecrs, and
</p>
<p>make a better- one. Don't say the machine is out of order ; it is in order;
</p>
<p>it does what its framers intended  pi-otect slavery. Our claim is Dis-
</p>
<p>union, breaking up of (he States! I have shown you that our work can-
</p>
<p>not be done under our institutions."
</p>
<p>''This Union is a lie ! The American Union is an imposture, a covenant
</p>
<p>with death, and an agreement with hell. * * * lam for its overthrow."^
</p>
<p>Said Lloyd Garrison :
</p>
<p>" Up with the flag of Disunion, that we may have a free and glorious
</p>
<p>Republic of our own ; and when the hour shall come, the hour will have
</p>
<p>arrived that shall witness the overthrow of slavery."
</p>
<p>Here is what Phillips said of the Republican party, when it was organ-
</p>
<p>ized as a sectional party, and it will be noticed how well and how truly
</p>
<p>he pictured it :
</p>
<p>" No man has a right to be surprised at this state of things. It is just
</p>
<p>what we [Abolitionists and Disuuionists] have attempted to bring about.
</p>
<p>It is the first sectional party ever organized in this country. It does not
</p>
<p>know its own face, and calls itself national  it is sectional. The Repub-
</p>
<p>lican party is a party of the North, pledged against the South."
</p>
<p>Gai-rison, in his Liberator, said still more explicitly :
</p>
<p>" The Republican party is moulding public sentiment in the right di-
</p>
<p>rection for the specific work the Aboliticmists are striving to accomplish,
</p>
<p>viz. : 7V;e dissolution of the Union, and the abolition of Slaver!/ throughout

</p>
<p>the land."
</p>
<p>All the while that the Abolitionists were talking thus boldly, the Repub-
</p>
<p>lican leaders pretended to the people that Garrison nnd Piiiilips did not
</p>
<p>represent their sentiments ; but let it be remembered tliat tiny expressed
</p>
<p>most substantially the same sentiments, yet in more vague ami uncertain
</p>
<p>language. Said Abraham Lincoln in his famous controversy with Judge
</p>
<p>Douglas :
</p>
<p>" / believe this Government cannot endure permanently half slave and
</p>
<p>half free."
</p>
<p>That is, that it cannot endure as Washington formed it, and as it ex-
</p>
<p>isted for seventy years. Mr. Garrison was of exactly the same opinion ;
</p>
<p>and, though Mr. Lincoln does not say all that Mr. Garrison doei, yet the
</p>
<p>person must be stupid who cannot see what Mr. Lincoln's real meaning
</p>
<p>is. And if any proof were needed of the identity of their principles, it
</p>
<p>12 "to all whom it may concekn."
</p>
<p>is to be found in the fact that ]Mr. Lincoln has at last openly come to
</p>

</p>
<p>William H. Seward, in his celebrated Ohio speech, said :
</p>
<p>" It [slavery] can and must be abolished, and you and I must do it. * *
</p>
<p>Correct your own error, that slavenj has Conililutional guarantees which
</p>
<p>may not be released, and ought not to be relinquished. * * * You will
</p>
<p>soon bring the parties of the country into an effective aggression upon
</p>
<p>slavery."
</p>
<p>Mark tlie words, ^^ aggression upon slavery!'''' and also the denial of the
</p>
<p>plain Constitutional provision guaranteeing the right to hold slaves.
</p>
<p>N. P. Banks, now one of Mr. Lincoln's Major-Generals, said in a speech
</p>
<p>delivered in Maine, in 1855, and while Governor of Massachusetts :
</p>
<p>" Although I am not one of that class of men who cry for the preser-
</p>
<p>vation of the Union ; though I am willing, in a certain stale of circumstances,
</p>
<p>TO LKT IT SLIDE, I have uo fear for its perpetuation. But, let me
</p>
<p>say, if the chief object of the people of this country be to maintain and
</p>
<p>propagate chattel property in man  in other words, human slavery  this
</p>
<p>Union cannot and ought not to stand."
</p>
<p>Now, I would ask, in all candor, suppose a prominent Democrat had
</p>
<p>uttered those sentiments, would he not have been scouted by his party as
</p>
<p>one infected with political leprosy ? Did the Republican party so treat
</p>
<p>Governor Banks ? No, indeed ; but the very next session of Congress 
</p>
<p>the session of 1856  they elected him Speaker of the national House of
</p>
<p>Eepresentatives !
</p>
<p>Still later in 1858  in a speech in Massachusetts, we find Mr. Banks
</p>
<p>turning prophet, and predicting a ^'' military dictatorial Govermnenf^ in
</p>
<p>this country. lie had no faith in the stability of "j'Vee institutions.'^
</p>
<p>He said:
</p>
<p>"1 can conceive of a time when this Constitution shall not be in exist-
</p>
<p>ence ; wlien we sliall have an absolute military dictatorial Govermnent,
</p>
<p>transmitted from age to age, with men at its head who ai-e made rulers by
</p>
<p>military commission, or who claim an hereditary right to govern those
</p>
<p>over whom they are placed."
</p>
<p>Senator Wade, of Ohio, at a mass meeting in Maine, the same at which

</p>
<p>Mr. Banks spoke, gave utterance to the following treasonable sentiments :
</p>
<p>" Tlie only salvation of the Union, is to be found in divesting it of all
</p>
<p>taint of human slavery. Or, let us sweep away this remnant which we
</p>
<p>call a Union. I go for a Union where all men are equal, or for NO Union
</p>
<p>at all ; and I go for right."
</p>
<p>And, as if to mark their approval of such doctrines, the Republicans
</p>
<p>of Ohio, the very next year, re-elected this disunionist to the Senate of
</p>
<p>the United States. His brother, Hon. Edwin Wade, has, for a number
</p>
<p>of years, occupied a seat in the House of Representatives, and we find
</p>
<p>him, in a speech delivered in the House, August 2, 1856, indorsing the
</p>
<p>treasonable doctrine of his Senatorial brother. We quote :
</p>
<p>" Sir, if the Constitution and the Union are to be used as instruments
</p>
<p>for propagating hunum bondage, tlu^y cannot be preserved  neither is it
</p>
<p>desirable that they should. The spirit which has taken possession of the
</p>
<p>"TO ALL WHOM IT MA.Y CONUKRN." 13
</p>
<p>slaveholders and their base tools, the Democracy of the free Staten, in
</p>
<p>the unclean thing of slavery propagandisrn ; and just as sure as animal
</p>
<p>life perishes in mephitic gases, so sure is it tliat the Constitution and
</p>
<p>Union must perish when smothered in the fond embraces of tlu'sv allies
</p>
<p>of human slavery."
</p>
<p>"Allies of human slavery !"  Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Jackson,
</p>
<p>Polk, &c.
</p>
<p>The Hon. Sidney Dean, of Connecticut, is in favor of dissolving the
</p>
<p>Union, unless freedom  that is, the freedom of the black ract  sliall bo
</p>
<p>inaugurated in this country. We quote from a sjjeech of his delivered in
</p>
<p>the House of Representatives, July 23, 18.56 :
</p>
<p>"The issue of all, the reason of all, the basis of all this lies in the sim-
</p>
<p>ple question, shall freedom or slavery be tlio ruling, pri'dominant feature
</p>
<p>of the model Republic of the world ? That question can be answered in
</p>
<p>one way. Freedom, human, personal freedom, the fulfilment of the great
</p>
<p>sentiment, 'that all men are created free and equal.' "
</p>
<p>Mark the lying interpolation. The words of the Declaration of Inde-
</p>
<p>pendence are, " all men are created equal." The word free docs not
</p>
<p>occur, and yet it is constantly quoted by abolition speakers and writers,
</p>
<p>as the Honorable Mr. Dean has quoted it. This is one of the methods
</p>
<p>by which the people are cheated. He proceeds,
</p>
<p>" This will be the national ruling of this country for future centuries, or
</p>
<p>the sun of its past glory will set in drapery crimsoned in its own blood
</p>
<p>ere it reaches a century of its existence."
</p>
<p>Judge Rufus P. Spaulding, a delegate to the Republican Convention.
</p>
<p>in 1856, and also to the Convention that nominated Mr. Lincoln, said in a
</p>
<p>speech made in the former Convention :
</p>
<p>" In case of the alternatives being presented, of the continuance of
</p>
<p>slavery or a dissolution of the Union, I am for dissolution, and I care
</p>
<p>NOT HOW QUICK IT COMES."
</p>
<p>There is no begging the question with Judge Spaulding ; he speaks
</p>
<p>the sentiments of his party in plain Saxon.
</p>
<p>Said the Hon. Horace Mann, of Massachusetts, in a speech delivered
</p>
<p>on the floor of the national House of Representatives:

</p>
<p>" I have only to add, under a full sense of my responsibility to my
</p>
<p>country and my God, I deliberately say, better disunion, better a
</p>
<p>SERVILE war, better any thing that God in His providence shall send,
</p>
<p>than an extension of the bonds of slavery."
</p>
<p>Charles Sumner, the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations
</p>
<p>in the United States Senate, while advocating the ab,)litii)n of slavery iu
</p>
<p>a speech delivered in Faneuil Hall, Boston, November 2d, 1855, said :
</p>
<p>"God forbid, that for the sake of the Union, we should sacrifice the very
</p>
<p>thing for which the Union was made."
</p>
<p>Still later, on the 19th and 20th of May, 18.55, in a speech delivered in
</p>
<p>the Senate, Mr. Sumner held this revolutionary language :
</p>
<p>" Already has the muster begun. The strife is no longer local, but
</p>
<p>national. Even now while I speak portents hang on all the arches of the
</p>
<p>li " TO ALL WnOM IT MAY CONCERN.'
</p>
<p>horizon, threatening to darken the broad hand, which already yawns with-
</p>
<p>the mutterings q/" CIVIL war."
</p>
<p>Mr. Sumner, perfectly understanding the dark secrets of his party,
</p>
<p>heard, even in 1855, " the mutterings of our present deph)rable civil war !"
</p>
<p>William H. Seward, in his speech in the Senate, April 9, 1856, said :
</p>
<p>"He who found a river in his path, and sat down to wait for the flood
</p>
<p>to pass away, was not more unwise than he who expects the agitatiop of
</p>
<p>slavery to cease while the love of freedom animates the bosoms of man-
</p>
<p>kind."
</p>
<p>And then, after showing that this agitation will lead to war between
</p>
<p>the North and the South, Mr. Seward suggests to the Pacific States that
</p>
<p>then would be their time to withdraw from the Union. He continues :
</p>
<p>" Then the free States and the slave States of the Atlantic, divided and
</p>
<p>warring with each other, would disgust the free States of the Pacific, and
</p>
<p>they would have abundant cause and justification for withdrawing from
</p>
<p>A Uxiox productive no longer of peace, safety, and liberty to themselves,
</p>
<p>and no longer holding up the cherished hopes of mankind."
</p>
<p>This is South Carolina doctrine.
</p>
<p>Again, in his speech at Albany, October 12, 1855, Mr. Seward said :
</p>
<p>" Slavery is not, and never can be, perpetual. It will be overthrown
</p>
<p>either peacefully and lawfully under this Constitution, or it will work the
</p>
<p>subversion of the Constitution, together with its own overthrow. Then
</p>
<p>the SLAVEHOLDERS WOULD PERISH IN THE STRUGGLE."
</p>
<p>Again, in his speech in the Senate, March 11, 1850, Mr. Seward threat-
</p>
<p>ens the South with "civil war" unless they emancipate their slaves. He
</p>
<p>says :
</p>
<p>"When this answer shall be given it will appear that the question of
</p>
<p>dissolving the Union is a complex question that embraces the fearful
</p>
<p>issue whether the Union shall stand and slavery under the steady, peace-
</p>
<p>ful action of moral, social, and political causes, bo removed by gi-adual
</p>
<p>voluntary effort, and with compensation, or whether the UNION shall be
</p>
<p>Di.ssf>LVED, civil war ensue, bringing on violent but conqylete and imme-
</p>
<p>diate emancipation. We are now arrived at that stage when that crisis
</p>
<p>can be foreseen  when we must foresee it. It is directly before us. Its

</p>
<p>shadow is upon us."
</p>
<p>In plain words, Mr. Seward says to the South : You can have union
</p>
<p>and the gradual emancipation of slavery, or you shall have disunion, civil
</p>
<p>war, and inuiunliate emancipation ! This, in plain P'nglish, was his
</p>
<p>proposition.
</p>
<p>The Hon. Francis E. Spinner, Register of the Treasury Department
</p>
<p>under Mr. Chase, said, in a speech delivered in 1856, alluding to the
</p>
<p>possilde failui-e of the Republicans in the effort to elect Fremont :
</p>
<p>" Tlie free North would be left to the choice of peaceful DISSOLUTION
</p>
<p>OP THE Union, a civil war, which would end in the same, or an uncon-
</p>
<p>ditional surrender of every principh* held dear by freemen."
</p>
<p>That most charitable, meek, and liberal-minded apostle of Abolitionism,
</p>
<p>Henry Ward IJeecher, said in 1856, in a speech at New Haven, Ct., whore
</p>
<p>he proclaimed that "a Sharp's rifle waa a truly moral agency:"
</p>
<p>"to all whom it may concern." 15
</p>
<p>"If this poacoful remedy [the biiHot-hox] shoiikl fail to he apjilicd thin
</p>
<p>year, then the people will count the cost wisely, and decide for them-
</p>
<p>selves, boldly and firmly, which is the better way, to RISE IN ARMS ANJ>
</p>
<p>THROW OFF A GOVERNMENT worsc than tlidl. of old King George, or en-
</p>
<p>dure it another four years, and then vote again."
</p>
<p>In the same speech, Mr. Beechor thus denounced the Constitution of
</p>
<p>the United States :
</p>
<p>" The Constitution is the cause of every divisicm which this vexed nues-
</p>
<p>tion of slavei-y has ever occasioned in this country. It has been the foun-
</p>
<p>tain and father of our troubles, by attempting to hold together, as recon-
</p>
<p>ciled, two opposing principles, which will not harmonize nor agree. The
</p>
<p>only hope of the slave is, over the ruins of the Govemmenl and of the
</p>
<p>American Church. The dissolution of the Union is the abolition of slavery."
</p>
<p>James Watsnn Webb, Mr. Lincoln's minister to Brazil, was a delegate
</p>
<p>to the Convention that nominated Mr. Lincoln, and also the Convention
</p>
<p>that nominated Fremont. In his speech, in that Convention, he gave
</p>
<p>utterance to the following words, which were received with tumultuous
</p>
<p>cheering and cries of " good :"
</p>
<p>" They [the slaveholders] tell you they are willing to abide by the ballot-
</p>
<p>box, and are willing to make that last appeal. If we fail there, what tlieii ?
</p>
<p>We will drive it back, sword in hand ; and, so help me God, believing
</p>
<p>that to be right, I am with them. [Loud cheers and cries of "Good!"]
</p>
<p>Northern gentleman, on your action depends the result. You may, with
</p>
<p>God's blessing, present to this country a name, rallying around it all the
</p>
<p>elements of the Opposition, and thus we will become so strong that,
</p>
<p>through the ballot-box, we will save the country. But if a name be pre-
</p>
<p>sented on which we may not rally, and the consequence is civil war 
</p>
<p>nothing more, nothing less, but civil war  I ask, then, what is our iirst
</p>
<p>duty?"
</p>
<p>In the same Convention, the Hon. Erastus Hopkins used these words;
</p>
<p>" If peaceful means fail us, and we are driven to the last extremity,
</p>
<p>when ballots are useless, then we will make bullets effective."
</p>
<p>The Hon. John P. Hale, United States Senator from New Hampshire,
</p>
<p>was also a delegate to the Convention, and addresscid it at length. He

</p>
<p>congratulated the Convention upon the spirit of unanimity with which
</p>
<p>it had done its work. He said :
</p>
<p>" I believe that this is not so much a Convention to change the Admin-
</p>
<p>istration of the Government, as to say whether there shall be any Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment to be administered.  You have assembled not to say whether
</p>
<p>this Union shall be preserved, but to say whether it shall be a blessing
</p>
<p>or a scorn and hissing among nations."
</p>
<p>On the 31st of May, 1848, he said: " Let the consequences be what
</p>
<p>they may, 1 am willing to place myself upon the principle of human right;
</p>
<p>to stand where the word of God and my own con.science concur in placing
</p>
<p>me, and there bid defiance to all consequences. And in the end, if this
</p>
<p>Union, bound as it is to associations, has no other principle of cement
</p>
<p>than the blood of human slavery, let it sunder.''''
</p>
<p>Again, on the 12th of July, he said :
</p>
<p>" All the horrors of dissolution I can look steadfastly in the face, before
</p>
<p>I could look to that moral ruin which must fall upon us when we have so
</p>
<p>16 " TO ALL WHOM IT MAY CONCERN."
</p>
<p>far prostituted ourselves as to become the pioneers of slavery in the Ter-
</p>
<p>ritories."
</p>
<p>In the Senate on the 2Gth February, 1856. he said: " I thank Ood that
</p>
<p>the indications of the pi-csent day seem to promise that the North have at
</p>
<p>la.st got to the wall, and will go no farther. I hope so. The Senator says
</p>
<p>there may be a power that shall say ' Thus far shalt thou go. and no far-
</p>
<p>ther.' [Good! good !] Sir. I hope it will come, and if it comes to blood,
</p>
<p>let blood come. No, sir, if that issue must come, let it come, and it can-
</p>
<p>not come too soon. Sir, Puritan blood has not always shrunk from even
</p>
<p>those encounters ; and when the war has been pi'oclaimed with the knife,
</p>
<p>and the knife to the hilt, the steel has sometimes glistened in their hands;
</p>
<p>and when the battle was over, they were not always second best."
</p>
<p>Carl Schurz, appointed by Mr. Lincoln minister to Spain, was a dele-
</p>
<p>gate to the Chicago Convention, and took a very active part in securing
</p>
<p>the nomination of Mr. Lincoln. Hear him, in 1860, in a speech at St.
</p>
<p>Louis :
</p>
<p>"May the God in human nature be aroused and pierce the very soul of
</p>
<p>our nation with an energy that shall sweep as with the besom of "destruc-
</p>
<p>tion this abomination from the land. You call this revolution. It is. In
</p>
<p>this we need revolution ; we will have it ! Let it come!"
</p>
<p>Horace Greeley, to whom Mr. Lincoln is indebted for his nomination at
</p>
<p>Chicago, has always boldly advocated disunion :
</p>
<p>" If the Cotton States shall become satisfied that they can do better out
</p>
<p>of the Union than in it, we insist on letting them go in peace. The right
</p>
<p>to secede may be a revolutionary one, but it exists, nevertheless. * * *
</p>
<p>"We mu.st ever resist the right of any State to remain in the Union and
</p>
<p>nullify or destroy the laws thereof. To withdraw from the Union is quite
</p>
<p>anotlier matter. Whenever a considerable section of our Union shall
</p>
<p>deliberately resolve to go out, we shall resist all coercive measures de-
</p>
<p>signed to keep it in. We hope never to live in a republic whereof one
</p>
<p>section is pinned to another by bayonets."  Tribune of November 9,
</p>
<p>1860.
</p>
<p>' If the Cotton States unitedly and earnestly wish to withdraw peace-
</p>
<p>fully from the Union, we think they should be allowed to do so. Any

<p>attempt to compel them by force to remain, would be contrary to the
</p>
<p>principles enunciated in the immortal Declaration of Independence, con-
</p>
<p>trary to the fundamental ideas on which human liberty is based."  Tri-
</p>
<p>bune, November 26. 1860.
</p>
<p>"If it [the Declaration of Independence] justifies the secession from
</p>
<p>the IJritish empire of three millions of colonists in 1776, we do not see why
</p>
<p>it would not justify the secession of five millions of Southerners from the
</p>
<p>Union in 1861."  Tribune, December 17, 1860.
</p>
<p>" Whenever it shall be clear that the great body of the Southern people
</p>
<p>have become conclusively alienated from the Union, and anxious to escape
</p>
<p>from it, we will do our best to forward their views."  Tribune, February
</p>
<p>23, 1862.
</p>
<p>Tliaddeus Stevens, the Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means
</p>
<p>in the last Congress, and the acknowledged leader of the Republican
</p>
<p>party, said recently, in a si)eech at Lancaster :
</p>
<p>" If I believed that the object of this war was to restore the Union as
</p>
<p>it was, including slavery, I would be against the war."
</p>
<p>Mr. M. E. Conway, a Republican member of Congress from Kansas,
</p>
<p>"to all whom it may conckrn." 17
</p>
<p>in a fit of disgust at the "fast and loose" game of (Jerrit Smitli and others,
</p>
<p>concludes a letter to Mr. Greeley in these wttrds :
</p>
<p>'As to the Union, I would not give a cent for it. unh-ss it stood as a
</p>
<p>guarantee for freedom to every man, woman, and child within its entire
</p>
<p>jurisdiction. I consider the idea that every thing must he sacrificed to
</p>
<p>the Union utterly preposterous. Wliat was the Union mad(^ for ? Tiiat
</p>
<p>we should sacrifice ourselves to it ? I, for one, would beg to hi^ excused.
</p>
<p>As things stand I would sacrifice the Union to Freedom any morning he-
</p>
<p>fore breakfast."
</p>
<p>Ex-Governor Johnston is in favor of " trampling upon the Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion" if it stands in the way of "preserving!"  (Heaven save the mark !)
</p>
<p> " the nation !"
</p>
<p>These remarks of Governor Johnston were applauded at the Chestnut
</p>
<p>street League in Philadelphia.
</p>
<p>The atrocious Alfred N. Gilbert, addressing the Philadelphia Union
</p>
<p>League, said he "would see every woman and child in the South perish,"
</p>
<p>rather than that the Abolition party should fail in itsobjects.
</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln, when a member of Congress, in a speech delivered
</p>
<p>on the floor of the House, January 12th, 184S, boldly and emphatically
</p>
<p>advocated the doctrine of secession. He said:
</p>
<p>" Any people, anywhere, being inclined and having the power have a
</p>
<p>right to rise up and, shake off the existing government, and form a new
</p>
<p>one that suits them better. This is a most valuable, a most sacred right,
</p>
<p>a right which we hope and believe is to liberate the world. Nor is this
</p>
<p>right confined to cases in which the whole people of an existing gov-
</p>
<p>ernment may choose to exercise it. ^wy portion of such people that
</p>
<p>can may revolutionize and make their own of so much of the territory as.
</p>
<p>they inhabit. More than this, a majority of any portion of such people
</p>
<p>may revolutionize, putting down a minority, intermingled with or near
</p>
<p>about them, who may oppose their movements. It is a quality of revo-
</p>
<p>lution not to go by old lines or old laws, but to break up both and to make
</p>
<p>new ones."
</p>
<p>This speech will be found recorded in the Congressional rtiports of that
</p>
<p>session.

<p>So much for a portion only of what has been said and written. These
</p>
<p>quotations might be continued almost without limit. Now, what has been
</p>
<p>done ?
</p>
<p>And here it is proper to observe that the Republican party was t)rgan-
</p>
<p>ized, not as a national, but as a sectional or geographical party. The
</p>
<p>first meeting called for the purpose of its organization, was held on
</p>
<p>the 26th of September, 1854, at Auburn, New York, the home of William
</p>
<p>H. Seward. The object, as stated, was to "organize a Republican party,
</p>
<p>which should represent the friends of freedom." On that occasion Gen-
</p>
<p>eral Bruce said : " They would raise a thunder that would shake Southern
</p>
<p>Slavery to its very centre.'" In proof that its organization was purely
</p>
<p>sectional, the following resolution, oflfered by General Granger, was
</p>
<p>adopted :
</p>
<p>" Resolved, That we recommend that a Convention of delegates from
</p>
<p>the Free States, equal in number to their representatives in Congress, re-
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>18 "to all whom it may concern."
</p>
<p>spoctivoly, be lielil at the citj^ of Syracuse, on tlie 4th of July, 1856, to
</p>
<p>nominate candidates for the Presidency and Vice-Presidency of the
</p>
<p>United States, for the next Presidential election."
</p>
<p>The resolution was adopted with " treinendous cheering." Dr. Snod-
</p>
<p>grass moved to call this the Republican party. The Convention then
</p>
<p>adjourned sine die. The place of meeting of the proposed Convention
</p>
<p>was afterwards changed from Syracuse to Philadel^jhia, where, in pursu-
</p>
<p>ance of the foregoing resolution, they met and nominated Fremont.
</p>
<p>In 1800, the delegates met at Chicago, and nominated Lincoln. During
</p>
<p>the proceedings of that Convention, Judge Jessup rose and said :
</p>
<p>That he desired to amend a verbal mistake in the name of the party,
</p>
<p>It was printed in the resolutions " National Republican party." He
</p>
<p>wished to strike out the word National, as that was not the name by
</p>
<p>which the party was properly known.
</p>
<p>The correction was made. Thus originated the sectional party now in
</p>
<p>power, against which the NATIONAL Democratic party is contending.
</p>
<p>The limits of this address will not suffice to notice one-tenth part of the
</p>
<p>acts of these conspirators against our national Constitution, which, if all
</p>
<p>grouped together, would form a picture of political and moral depravity
</p>
<p>appalling in its hideousness.
</p>
<p>I must be content to select some of the more prominent and glaring.
</p>
<p>I pass over the infamous " personal liberty laws," adopted by Repub-
</p>
<p>lican Legislatures, designed to render nugatory the fourth clause of the
</p>
<p>second section of the fourth article of the Constitution.
</p>
<p>I pass by the " Emigrant Aid Societies," the " John Brown raid," and
</p>
<p>the circiihition of the atrocious " Helper book," with its indorsement by
</p>
<p>sixty-eight Republican Senators and members. And here let it be observed,
</p>
<p>that it is perfectly consistent with the philosophy of the human mind,
</p>
<p>that it may be gradually moulded and prepared by plausible arts and skill,
</p>
<p>playing upon the passions and prejudices, and even upon the purest and
</p>
<p>nobUsst impulses of the heart, until a species of moral insanity seizes
</p>
<p>upon and drags its victim down to irretrievable ruin.
</p>
<p>And tliis is the unfortuu'ite condition to which a large portion of the
</p>
<p>honest yeomanry of our country have been reduced by the infernal sorcery

<p>of the liouds of Abolitionism. With phiusible sophistry they have
</p>
<p>poisoned the delicate, sensitive, and impressionable mind of a large por-
</p>
<p>tion of the mothers and daughters, and through their influence, the male
</p>
<p>youtli of our land ; holding up to distempered fancy, highly colored pic-
</p>
<p>tures of a false philanthropy, until at length the glorious institutions of
</p>
<p>our Fathers have become subordinate to the dangerous sentimentalism of
</p>
<p>a" high. M- law" doctrine, promulgated as a political dogma by him who
</p>
<p>sits as prime minister at the right hand of Abraham the First. No free
</p>
<p>people ever lost their liberties by sudden assault.
</p>
<p>The citadel of American liberty, especially, could not have been
</p>
<p>Btormed without overwhelming discomfiture to the assailants. The
</p>
<p>attempt has been made to take it by siege, by gradual approaches, by
</p>
<p>" parallcl.s," to use a now familiar military term. Declarations and proc-
</p>
<p>lainaliwiis are issued, and acts performed to-day that could not have been
</p>
<p>"to all whom it MAV CONCKRX." 19
</p>
<p>declared or performed six inoiitlis aj^o. Tilings were said and done six
</p>
<p>months ago that could not have l)een said or done six inontlis i)revionsIy,
</p>
<p>and so on to the beginning of the chapter, wlien Mr. Ijincoln delivered
</p>
<p>his inaugural, declaring that he had " no constitutional right" to molest
</p>
<p>or interfere with any of the local institutions of th(^ rebellious States, and
</p>
<p>when, in December, 1861, Mr. Seward addressed his famous circular let-
</p>
<p>ter to our ambassadors at the several courts of Europe, explicitly and
</p>
<p>emphatically declaring the same cardinal truth.
</p>
<p>The worst passions of the human heart, disguised under the iiiantlcs of
</p>
<p>charity, philanthropes and expediency, have been employi'd witii (i,iabol-
</p>
<p>ical skill and success, to steal away th(> precious birthright of AuuTican
</p>
<p>liberty.
</p>
<p>If Satan were only permitted to wage his warfare against our fallen race
</p>
<p>in all the hideousuess, whci-ein he is represented to appear in the regions
</p>
<p>of Pandemonium, there would be no need of warning the people against
</p>
<p>him ; all men would flee in terror at his approach ; but, for some inscruta-
</p>
<p>ble purpose, he is permitted to assume many bright and alluring forms.
</p>
<p>Perhaps there is no garment in all his extensive sulphurous, wardrobe,
</p>
<p>which he wears with greater success in his infernal mission, than tlie drab
</p>
<p>cloak of canting hypocritical philanthi-opy.
</p>
<p>The horrible condition of our country to-day, is thi> result, or luitural
</p>
<p>sequence, of the Puritanical meddlesomeness and selfishness of the witch-
</p>
<p>burning semi-infidel portion of the New England population. There are,
</p>
<p>it is true,. some large-hearted, noble i>eople in New England; those who,
</p>
<p>to-day, stand up in their manhood, vainly, and almost hopelessly, strug-
</p>
<p>gling against a flood of fanaticism : men, for instance, like the venerable
</p>
<p>Bishop Hopkins, of Vermont, and Winthrop, of Massachusetts, especially
</p>
<p>merit the eulogy and sympathy of every champion of the Constitution.
</p>
<p>New England traded in negroes  in the Convention that framed the
</p>
<p>Constitution, she voted to extend the slave-trade twenty years, viz., until
</p>
<p>1808  brought them in ships from their native Africa, worked them ou
</p>
<p>her land, until its impoverished soil rendered it no longer profitable;
</p>
<p>and then, having made a ' smart" bargain (you may rely upon that), sold
</p>
<p>them to her Southern neighbors, whom she has never ceased to envy, in

</p>
<p>the wealth which the rich Southern soil has enabled them to derive from
</p>
<p>this species of labor.
</p>
<p>By amazing shrewdness and tact in political manoeuvring. New Eng-
</p>
<p>land, by means of her tariff, has always largely profiti'd from the labor of
</p>
<p>the slaves, while free from the expense or trouble of supporting them ;
</p>
<p>but her inordinate avarice and greed of wealth, has always induced a
</p>
<p>covetous hankering for the possession of that fair domain, whose princely
</p>
<p>harvests have supplied nearly four-fifths of the vast exportations of our
</p>
<p>magnificent commerce. And if she could only get possession of those
</p>
<p>rich cotton and rice plantations of Georgia and South Carolina, having
</p>
<p>first confiscatt'd the soil and exterminated the own<u-s; and could fill her
</p>
<p>coffers with pelf, by retaining all the negroes in a condition of bondage,
</p>
<p>it would be found before a great while, that one-half the population of
</p>
<p>Massachusetts, Vermont, and the other New England States, would be
</p>
<p>2U "to all whom it may concern/
</p>
<p>engaged in raising cotton and rico, \>y the use of slave labor (tlie only
</p>
<p>kind of labor, indeed, by which those staples can profitably be raised).
</p>
<p>The only ditfereuce would be, that for every bale of cotton which the
</p>
<p>moderately worked negro now produces, his sweat, yea, and blood, too,
</p>
<p>would be taxed to produce three.
</p>
<p>Heaven help the poor uegro, if he should ever change his present for
</p>
<p>New England masters I Tlieu would he know the bitterness of slavery !
</p>
<p>In this connection, it is worthy of remark, that in those States where
</p>
<p>Abolitionism is most rampant, are found the smallest number of free
</p>
<p>uegroes. .
</p>
<p>1 have shown that the I'resident, wheu a member of Congress, advo-
</p>
<p>cated Secession, or revolutionary doctrine ; that all, or most of the leaders
</p>
<p>of the Kepublicaa party, advocated violent revolutionary doctrines ; that
</p>
<p>Mr. Seward, promulgated as a political dogma, that there was a law-
</p>
<p>higher than the Constitution of the United States, to which the funda-
</p>
<p>mental law of the laud was declared to be subordinate ; that there was an
</p>
<p>'* irrepressible coutiict" between the slave labor of the South and the free
</p>
<p>Iab<-)r of the North, in the face of the fact, that the country had advanced
</p>
<p>from infancy to colossal maturity, under these two systems of labor;
</p>
<p>showing that, so far from there being a conflict, the two systems have
</p>
<p>worked together in beautiful harmony ; the producing slave labor of the
</p>
<p>South, and the manufacturing and conunercial enterprise of the North,
</p>
<p>operating harmoniously ; a system, in which there was no jar, until the dis-
</p>
<p>cordant element of New England fanaticism, got the machinery into disor-
</p>
<p>der. The Abolition Chicago Convention, was only a new act in the drama.
</p>
<p>The most radical abolitionists in the Convention  those who had preached
</p>
<p>the strongest disunion doctrines  were the most urgent advocates of Mr.
</p>
<p>Liiucoln's nomination, overxMr. Seward and all other candidates. Horace
</p>
<p>(ireeley was particularly active in securing his nomination. Seward was
</p>
<p>uot trusted by Greeby, i'hillips, Lovejoy, and the radicals of their com-
</p>
<p>plexion. They apprehended^ that after using the " Amei-icau citizens of
</p>
<p>African descent," until he (Seward) should be safely seated in the Pi'esi-
</p>
<p>titutial chair, he would abandon the uegro and " Tylerize" their party ;
</p>
<p>hence, they would not trust him. The programme had, doubtless, been

<p>arranged: Seward was to be used until the eleventh hour, to preach his
</p>
<p>" iirepressible" philosophy, and then to be thrown overboard. The man
</p>
<p>who hiid declared tliat  me government could not permanently exist half
</p>
<p>slave and half tree," was to be their standard-bearer, and so Abraham
</p>
<p>Lincoln was uominated.
</p>
<p>i pass over the scenes of the Presidential canvass, the deplorable
</p>
<p>division and wasting of the strength of the Democratic party ; pass over
</p>
<p>those days, wheu every Democratic heart was sad at the prospect of
</p>
<p>triumph, for tho first lime in our histoi-y, of a purely sectional party ;
</p>
<p>well remembering the warning voice of Washington in his Farewell Ad-
</p>
<p>dles.-, and the warnings of ail the great Statesmen, as well in the later, as
</p>
<p>in the early periods of tlie Republic, all of whom seemed to believe that
</p>
<p>this was ttie only strain which the Union was not strong enough to bear.
</p>
<p>1 pass over those ribald jests and taunts of tho Republicans, who, when
</p>
<p>"to all whom it may conckrx." 21
</p>
<p>Democratic voices were raised in earnest romonstraiico, supplication, and
</p>
<p>warnino^, against the election of a president committeil to a sectional i)lat-
</p>
<p>forni, called tluMn in derision, "Union-savers," " Union-shrickers," and
</p>
<p>other opprobrious epithets, as now the same men call Democrats, " Cop-
</p>
<p>perheads," and "traitors," in their spite: becauee what was then predict-
</p>
<p>ed, has been verified by the ghastly logic of events, and because the same
</p>
<p>warning voice that was disregarded then, is again raised, in pleading ac-
</p>
<p>cents for the preservation of all that remains of the dearest rights of
</p>
<p>American freemen.
</p>
<p>As the Democracy truly predicted in 1860, so now the same patriotic
</p>
<p>voice is heard, crying aloud, " to all whom it may concern," proclaiming
</p>
<p>to their misguided countrymen, that, dreadful as are the present evils,
</p>
<p>they are small in comparison with the calamities that are in store for the
</p>
<p>people, if the present Administration, with its ruinous policy of c nduct-
</p>
<p>ing the war for conquest, subjugation, confiscation, and emancipation,
</p>
<p>instead of for the preservation of the Union under the Constitution of
</p>
<p>our fathers, shall be cojitinued during the ensuing four years.
</p>
<p>Passing all these scenes, I beg leave to remind you of the condition of
</p>
<p>the country between the period of Mr. Lincoln's election and his inau-
</p>
<p>guration ; State after State, deliberately holding conventions and pass-
</p>
<p>ing ordinances of secession  assigning as a reason therefor, that the
</p>
<p>incoming Administration was committed to an invasion of their Constitu-
</p>
<p>tional rights ; the people everywhere throughout the Northei-n and
</p>
<p>Border States in a condition of wild excitement and alarm ; while there,
</p>
<p>at Springfield, sat the President elect, one line of assurance from whose
</p>
<p>pen at that juncture might have been potential in averting the horrors that
</p>
<p>have ensued ; and although he was adjured to write but a single line, and
</p>
<p>innumerable letters were addressed to him from every quarter, imploring
</p>
<p>him to speak or write but a word, his ear remained deaf to every ai>peal.
</p>
<p>His voice was silent, while the gallant ship, freighted with the dearest
</p>
<p>earthly hopes of humanity, was struggling in the trough ot" a tempestuous
</p>
<p>sea of passion. He who had been clothed with a moral power for good
</p>
<p>or for evil, such as but few in history have ever possessed, chose the evil,
</p>
<p>and refused to utter one syllable of assurance, by which tlie frenzied pas-

</p>
<p>sions of the hour might have been calmed, and the awful burden of grief
</p>
<p>and anxiety lifted from the oppressed and bleeding heart of the Nation.
</p>
<p>No, fellow-countrymen, this was not in the programme ! Will it be said,
</p>
<p>in explanation of this inexplicable silence, that to have spoken or written
</p>
<p>would have done no good ? I ask, could it by any possibility have done
</p>
<p>harm ? When men are honestly anxious to avert a calamity, do they not
</p>
<p>speak and act ? When your child is sick, does not your anxiety to have
</p>
<p>his malady cured induce you to act promptly  to try every remedy which
</p>
<p>is placed within reach ? or do you sit down idly, and crack unseemly
</p>
<p>jokes? He who would thus act, even in the case of an individual, would
</p>
<p>be justly execrated as a monster of depravity. What then must be
</p>
<p>thought of one who would so conduct himself when the national life was
</p>
<p>threatened  his country trembling and writhing in the throes of dis-
</p>
<p>solution !
</p>
<p>32 "to ALT, WHOM IT MAY CONCERN."
</p>
<p>History records that Nero, the monster of antiquity, fiddled while IJoin.
</p>
<p>was burning. The President will be fortunate if the impartial pen of
</p>
<p>history shall fail to record that Lincoln jested while his country was
</p>
<p>dijing !
</p>
<p>At length the President leaves Springfield, to travel towards the Capi-
</p>
<p>tal. In his journey thence, did he manifest that gravity of deportment
</p>
<p>wiiich might reasonably have been expected, under the circumstances,
</p>
<p>would have marked the conduct of him who had been chosen to occupy
</p>
<p>the chair of Washington ? No; he talked flippantly about an "artificial
</p>
<p>crisis;" he talked about "his whiskers;" he indulged in humorous jests
</p>
<p>about " nobody being hurt;" and finally, capped the climax of folly in
</p>
<p>the memorable night journey from Harrisburg to the national Capital,
</p>
<p>disguised in the costume of a tartan cap, and enveloped in the ample
</p>
<p>folds of a long military cloak.
</p>
<p>Having reached the Capital in safety, we find, in the character of the
</p>
<p>inaugural ceremonies, the natural fruit of those revolutionary doctrines
</p>
<p>which himself and his wily associates had taught for so many years.
</p>
<p>The cup of American humiliation was filled when a President of the
</p>
<p>tJnited States was inaugurated under the protection of drawn sabres and
</p>
<p>glistening bayonets.
</p>
<p>"Oh, what a fall was there, my countrymen ! Then you and I, and all
</p>
<p>of us fell down, while bloody treason flourished over us."
</p>
<p>And still I might continue, in the language of the immortal bard (only
</p>
<p>pai-aphrasing a Httle) :
</p>
<p>" Ah, now you weep, and I perceive you feel the dint of pity  good
</p>
<p>friends  kind friends  let me not stir your hearts and minds to any sud-
</p>
<p>den flood of mutiny; they that have done this deed are honorable. What
</p>
<p>private griefs they have, alas, 1 know not. that made them do it ! They
</p>
<p>are wise and honorable, and will, no doubt, with reason answer you. I
</p>
<p>come not, friends, to steal away your hearts I I am no orator, as Everett
</p>
<p>is. But as you know nu> all, a plain, blunt man, that love my country  
</p>
<p>and that they know full well that gave me public leave to speak of it!
</p>
<p>For I have neither wit. nor words, nor uorth ; action, nor utterance, nor
</p>
<p>power of speech, to stir men's blood  I only speak right on. I tell you that

<p>which you yourselves do know; show you my country's wounds, poor,
</p>
<p>poor dumb mouths, and bid them spi ak for me. But, were I Kverctt,
</p>
<p>and Everett I, there were one would ruffle up your spirits, and put a
</p>
<p>tongue in every wound of my country, that should move the stones of
</p>
<p>America to rise and mutiny."
</p>
<p>The inaugural ceremonies over, the inaugural oath subscribed before
</p>
<p>high Heaven and the sovereign people, that he, Abraham Lincoln, would
</p>
<p>'^' preserve, protect, and defend''' the Constitution of the United States,
</p>
<p>what followed ?
</p>
<p>'i'wo long months of time  each hour pregnant with the interests of
</p>
<p>Centuries  wasted and frittered away in a degrading scramble for those
</p>
<p>places of profit, for which, many had then, and have since, bartered their
</p>
<p>inestimable birthright.
</p>
<p>During the period intervening between the election and the inaugura-
</p>
<p>tion of Mr. Lincoln, James Buchanan, who, from long experience in the

<p>"to all whom it may concern." 2 3
</p>
<p>councils of the country, having a perfect uiidorstaiiding of tlio tlu-ory a"<l
</p>
<p>character of our federative structure of Government; and knowing full
</p>
<p>well that civil war, once, commenced, would result in consequences too
</p>
<p>deplorable to be contemplated, endeavored by every means within hi;*
</p>
<p>power to avert the dreadful catastrophe of armed collision.
</p>
<p>And here I desire to record, that while all my political life  as is wM
</p>
<p>known  I openly opposed Mr. Buchanan's presidential aspirations (being
</p>
<p>favorable to another) ; opposed him at Baltimore, in the contest with
</p>
<p>General Cass; went to Cincinnati, and opposed his nomination there i
</p>
<p>yes, opposed him in the days of his power and influence, when many who
</p>
<p>now, with base ingratitude, when the sceptre of political power has de-
</p>
<p>parted, misrepresent and revile him, crooked the prc^gnant hinges of the
</p>
<p>knee, that thrift might follow fawning ; now, when the silver crown of ac-
</p>
<p>cumulated years admonishes him of the hour when the Judge of all the
</p>
<p>earth shall pronounce whether he kept his oath to ^* preserve, protect, and
</p>
<p>defend" the Constitution of his country, or broke it on the i)lea of expe-
</p>
<p>diency ; now, when hypoci'ites, and knaves, and thoughtless men,
</p>
<p>blinded by partisan prejudice, vpvile, and slander, and would crucify
</p>
<p>him if they could, I take pleasure in thus publicly repelling these
</p>
<p>baseless accusations ; and, pointing to his message to Congress, of
</p>
<p>December, 1860, and then pointing to a desolate, broken, and dis-
</p>
<p>tracted country, declare that history will vindicate the principles asserted
</p>
<p>in that message, to wit: that the Government of the United .States de-
</p>
<p>pends for its perpetuity upon the virtue of the people, and the perfect
</p>
<p>good faith of the separate States, in maintaining, with scrupulous fidelity.
</p>
<p>in letter and spirit, the Federal Constitution ; that war between the States
</p>
<p>would be disunion, and perhaps centralization and despotism.
</p>
<p>During that winter, the Democratic Senators and members struggled
</p>
<p>hard against the tide of Abolition fanaticism. Various projects of com-
</p>
<p>promise were introduced, and rejected by the Republicans, one of which,
</p>
<p>that suggested by Senator Bigler, I always regarded as, more than any
</p>
<p>other, consistent with our Republican form of Government, viz. : To refer
</p>
<p>the whole question to a vote of the sovereign people. This, like the
</p>
<p>others, was rejected. Finally, the famous compromise resolutions of the

<p>patriot Crittenden  the life-lo,ng friend of Henry Clay  were intro-
</p>
<p>duced. The Southern members agreed to accept Mr. Critteudi'n's propo-
</p>
<p>sition as a settlement of the difficulty, provided the resolutions were pre-
</p>
<p>sented or indorsed by the Republican members. They (the Southera
</p>
<p>members) said, that the excitement and alarm existing in the Southern
</p>
<p>States, was created by the belief tiiat the Republican party had resolved
</p>
<p>on an aggressive warfare against their Constitutional guarantees ; and in
</p>
<p>justification of this apprehension, they pointed to the incontrovertible
</p>
<p>fact, that a war hud been semi-officially inaugurated by sixty-eight Repub-
</p>
<p>lican Senators and members, endorsing and circulating, under the privilege
</p>
<p>of their frank, the notorious " Helper Book." They pointed to the John
</p>
<p>Brown raid into Virginia, at Harper's Ferry, and to the fact that that old
</p>
<p>cut-throat and horse-thief had been canonized as a hero and martyr, un-
</p>
<p>rebuked by any portion of the Republican party. Tbey pointed to the
</p>
<p>24 " TO ALL WHOM IT MAY CONCERN."
</p>
<p>"personal liberty bills," which disgraced the statutes of every State
</p>
<p>where the Republican pai-ty was di)minant. They pointed to the incen-
</p>
<p>diary sentiments uttered by the leaders of that party, both in and out of
</p>
<p>Congress. All this, and more, they cited, to show that the alarm in the
</p>
<p>Southern States was not unreasonable, but perfectly natural. Now, said
</p>
<p>they, you Republican gentlemen can disabuse the minds of our constitu-
</p>
<p>ents, if they are unreasonably alarmed, by voting for these resolutions of
</p>
<p>Mr. Crittenden, and this whole difficulty may be amicably adjusted ; but
</p>
<p>if these measures are simply voted for by Democrats, (a two-third vote
</p>
<p>was necessary to pass the resolutions), the question will not have been
</p>
<p>changed, but remain precisely as before the vote, and no good will have
</p>
<p>been effected.
</p>
<p>Now, here was the question of peace or war suspended, as it were, by a
</p>
<p>thread  the dearest interests of mankind dependent on a ballot. On one
</p>
<p>side, peace, prosperity, national power, and constitutional liberty  as
</p>
<p>Washington and our fathers interpreted the name of liberty  on the
</p>
<p>Other side, war! civil war ! with all its accumulating horrors ; " States
</p>
<p>dissevei-ed, di<ci>rdant, belligerent," demoniac hate, bi'others slain by
</p>
<p>brothers, desolated fields and burning cities, the widow's anguish, the
</p>
<p>orphan's plaintive wail, the hissing scorn of freedom's votaries in every
</p>
<p>land, the imprecations coming up from generations of America yet in the
</p>

<p>offended God, who, when He had taken upon Himself the nature of man,
</p>
<p>said : " Blessed are the peace makers, for they shall be called the chil-

<p>dren of God." In view of this choice between the good and the evil, be-
</p>
<p>tween blessings and curses, how did the Republican members of Congress

<p>vote on these resolutions of the Kentucky Statesman ? Against them to a

<p>Merciful Heaven ! was hell un^iarred and the demons of perdition per-

<p>mitted at that critical moment to visit our earth, to conjure with devilish

<p>incantation those men in the Senate-house clothed with power and re-

<p>How else shall we account for this "most foul and unnatural" conduct?

<p>factorily for the rejection by the Republicans in Congress of those peace
</p>
<p>resolutions? We cannot. It was not in the programme ! Other efforts
</p>
<p>were made by the Democrats. The Peace Congress was convened, and
</p>
<p>adjourned with the same result. So fearful were the Abolitionists that
</p>
<p>measures might be adopted in that Convention wliioli would destroy their
</p>
<p>infernal plot, that letters were written by Senators and members to
</p>
<p>the Republican Governors of the vai-ious States, urging the appointment
</p>
<p>of men as delegates to the Conventicm who could be relied upon to oppose
</p>
<p>all compromise. Here is a specimen of these prcK-ious epistles, written
</p>
<p>by United States Senator Chandler, of Michigan, to the Governor of that
</p>
<p>State :
</p>
<p>' To His Exrellency, Justin Blair:
</p>
<p>* Governor Hingham and myself telegraphed you on Saturday, at the
</p>
<p>request of Massachusetts and New York, to send di^legates to the Peace

<p>"TO ALL WHOM IT MAY OONCKRN. 2o

<p>or Comproiniso Congress. Tlioy admit tliat wp wcro right and that they

<p>wero wrong, that no Ropuhlican Stato should have sent didi-gatcs. hut
</p>
<p>they are here and cannot get away. Oliio, In<liiiMa. and Khode Island
</p>
<p>are caving in, and there is danger of Illinois, and now tliey heg us fur
</p>
<p>God's sake to come to their rescue, and sav(^ the Repuhlican ])arty from
</p>
<p>rupture. I hope you will send stiff-backed men or none. The whole
</p>
<p>thing was gotten up against my judgment and advice and will end in
</p>
<p>thin smoke. Still I hope as a matter of courtesy to some of our erring
</p>
<p>brethren that you will send the delegates.
</p>
<p>*' Truly, your friend,
</p>
<p>"Z. CHAXDLEU.
</p>
<p>"P. S.  Some of the manufacturing States think that a fiijiit would ho
</p>
<p>awful. Without a little blood-letting this Union will not, in my estima-
</p>
<p>tion, be worth a rush.
</p>
<p>"Washington, February 11, 1861."
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania's most exemphiry Executive (?) Andrew G. Curtin, sent to
</p>
<p>that Peace Congress delegates who he well knew would vote against all
</p>
<p>compromise. Why did he select David Wilmot as a delegate to that
</p>
<p>convention ? Did he, like Senator Chandler, feel greater solicitude
</p>
<p>to save the "Republican party" than to save the Union? Did
</p>
<p>he also think that a little " blood-letting" would be good for the
</p>
<p>country ? I charge upon Governor Curtin, that by sending Judge
</p>
<p>Wilmot to that convention, he made himself quite as responsible for
</p>
<p>his share in pi-eventing the adoption of all propositions of compromise
</p>
<p>and peace wiiich were there persistently voted down, as if he had been
</p>
<p>present, and had spoken and voted as Judge Wilmot spoke and voted.
</p>
<p>It is impossible to crowd into the limits necessary to be observed
</p>
<p>all the evidence of this most atrocious plot that, like the spectres
</p>
<p>in King Richard's slumber, pass in rapid review before the mental vision.
</p>
<p>Referring again to the period after Mr. Lincoln's inauguration, while
</p>
<p>the patriots were all engaged in saving as much of the country as would
</p>
<p>hold the spoils they were industriously appoi-tioning. Commissioners from
</p>
<p>South Carolina arrived in Washington, and while these men were being
</p>
<p>hoodwinked by Mr. Seward promising them that the status at Fort Sum-

</p>
<p>ter should not be disturbed, and the Commissioners, on their part, prom-
</p>
<p>ising that the gallant Major Anderson and his little band of heroes in
</p>
<p>Foi-t Sumter should have every thing in the way of provisions supplied
</p>
<p>them, until some satisfactory arrangement could, perhaps, be agreed
</p>
<p>upon, the Administration were engaged in secretly fitting out an expe-
</p>
<p>dition in the harbor of New York to provision and garrison the fort, know-
</p>
<p>ing full well that, under the circumstances, these vessels, or the fort
</p>
<p>itself, would be fired upon. They calculated rightly. An overt act of
</p>
<p>war was perpetrated; our glorious Star-spangled Banner desecrated, the
</p>
<p>heart of the Northern masses fired, "the Republican party saved," and
</p>
<p>the Union, it may be, lost!
</p>
<p>The events of that culminating period will form a dark chapter in
</p>
<p>the history of this bloody drama. It will be recollected that in the lat-
</p>
<p>ter part of May or first of June, 1861, the telegraph offices in the princi-
</p>
<p>pal cities were taken possession of by the Governraeat authorities, and
</p>
<p>2G " TO ALL WHOM IT MAY C0NCI:RN."
</p>
<p>among tlio copies of telegrams seized were those of a certain James E.
</p>
<p>Hurve}', who had been appointed minister to Portugal. These telegrams
</p>
<p>revealed the fact that Mr. Harvey had been in correspondence with the
</p>
<p>Rebels at (Charleston, South Carolina, and had communicated to them the
</p>
<p>fact that a fleet of vessels was fitting out in the harbor of New York, de-
</p>
<p>signed to provision the garrison at Fort Sumter. This information caused
</p>
<p>the Kebel authorities to determine to fire upon Fort Sumter, when the
</p>
<p>said fleet should appear off the Charleston bar. On the 7th of June, the
</p>
<p>New York Tribune, and the Press generally, violently assailed Mr. Harvey
</p>
<p>for having betrayed the secrets of the Administration in giving this infor-
</p>
<p>mation to the Rebels. When thes-e newspaper articles reached Mr. Har-
</p>
<p>vey at Lisbon, he wrote a "Card," dated Lisbon, July 7, 1861, which was
</p>
<p>published in the Philadelphia " North American,'' on the 27th of that
</p>
<p>month, wherein he exonerates himself by declaring that all of the aforesaid
</p>
<p>correspondence was by authority of the President and Cabinet, In his
</p>
<p>card he says :
</p>
<p>"While holding an official position I am precluded from making decla-
</p>
<p>rations which would at once give a satisfactory answer to these slanders."
</p>
<p>" I do not choose to utter a word at this time, which would in any manner
</p>
<p>impair the action of the Government, or subject others to harsh and un-
</p>
<p>just comment, when I know that their motives, like my own, were the
</p>
<p>purest and best."
</p>
<p>'' The fact is, the Government was in possession of every tittle of the
</p>
<p>evidence which had accumulated in Washington long before the public
</p>
<p>seizure was ordered ; several weeks before 1 left there, and before 1 had
</p>
<p>received or accepted any commission. If there was any thing to know it
</p>
<p>was known fully and entirely, as Avill be shown whenever necessary. I
</p>
<p>assert th'^ fact distinctly, without condition or reservation. I submitted
</p>
<p>to their inspection every line received b}^ telegraph, and never held any
</p>
<p>other correspondence but that, direct or indirect."
</p>
<p>Did Mr. Harvey state the case truly ? If he did not, why has he been
</p>
<p>retained in his important mission from that day till this ?
</p>
<p>]f he did, what object had the Administration in revealing the fact
</p>
<p>of this preparation to provision the fort ? Was it that an overt act of

<p>rebellion might be committed, " the Northern heart fired," and, in the
</p>
<p>language of Senator Chandler, in his letter to Governor Blair, " the Re-
</p>
<p>publican party saved from rupture ?" or did Mr. Seward believe it to be
</p>
<p>his duty, as he subsequently avowed, to take care " that the war should be
</p>
<p>begun by the enemies of the Union ?"
</p>
<p>Well, Sumter was fired upon, the Northern heart 'was fired, and then
</p>
<p>came the call for seventy-five thousand troops, and then came from the
</p>
<p>mountains and the valleys, from the rostrum and the anvil, from the mer-
</p>
<p>chant's desk and the laborer's ditch, from the gilded saloons of luxury
</p>
<p>and the rugged cot of penury, from Democrats and Republicans  one
</p>
<p>grand, spontaneous shout, " The Union ! it must and shall be preserved!"
</p>
<p>Then came " Bull Run ;" then the resolutions by Congress, declar-
</p>
<p>ing the war to be " for the preservation of the Constitution and the resto-
</p>
<p>ration of the Union, with all the rights and dignity of the several States
</p>
<p>unimpaired," and that when " these objects" should be " attained the war
</p>
<p>"to all whom it may conceun." 27
</p>
<p>ouj^lil io cease," passed unanimously except tw(t votes, one a Xnrtlicru
</p>
<p>Abolilionists, the other a Southern Secessionist. In the extremity of
</p>
<p>alarmcaused by the Bull Run rout, the Republicans voted with the De-
</p>
<p>mocrats for these resolutions.
</p>
<p>Under the belief that this was the real purpose of the Administration, a
</p>
<p>vast army of volunteers was obtained, and when the Administration found
</p>
<p>itself secure behind an impregnable wall of bayonets, the prosecution of
</p>
<p>the programme was resumed.
</p>
<p>This naiTative having been thus extended, it is out of the question to
</p>
<p>follow step Ijy step the insidious approaches upon the citadel of liberty,
</p>
<p>over a violated Constitution, under the hypocritical mask of pretending
</p>
<p>to defend it. Under the plausible cant, "the Union," "the flag," "the
</p>
<p>Constitution," and "the unconditional support of the Government,"
</p>
<p>appeals so potent as to reach every patriotic heart; the masses of the
</p>
<p>people were for a long time deceived, and many still remain under the
</p>
<p>fatal delusion ; notwithstanding that every promise for the restoration
</p>
<p>of the Union has been broken, and that blessed consummation put more
</p>
<p>than ever remote by an insane policy, which looks to the sudden emanci-
</p>
<p>pation of four millions of negroes, and their elevation to the condition of
</p>
<p>white men. Feeble man warring in blind fanatical fury, against the im-
</p>
<p>mutable laws of God. whose wisdom is made manifest in an inequality
</p>
<p>in creation " spreading through all life, extending through all extent,"
</p>
<p>observable alike in the vegetable, the mineral, and the animal kingdoms,
</p>
<p>one seed producing a delicious fruit, another the deadly upas, the beauti-
</p>
<p>ful pearl taken from its ocean bed of innumerable and to tlie superficial
</p>
<p>mind, worthless, yet in the wise economy of nature, equally valuable peb-
</p>
<p>bles ; while in the higher order of creation we have a Milton and the
</p>
<p>babbling idiot, a Caligula, and a Howard, a Washington, and a Lincoln '
</p>
<p>Nearly every vestige of the Constitutional guarantees to the citizen
</p>
<p>has been ignored, or crushed beneath the heel of tyrannical usurpatii>n.
</p>
<p>While the flag of our country is held aloft, as the symbol of the Union
</p>
<p>of the States, glittering in the splendor of its thirty-four stars, we have
</p>
<p>it semi-officially announced, by a high functionary of the administration,
</p>
<p>no less a personage than the Solicitor of the War De[)artment. that the

<p>light of ten at least of those stars, is to be extinguished. State lines,
</p>
<p>says Mr. Whiting, enforcing Charles Sumner's pet scheme, must be
</p>
<p>obliterated ; the domain reduced to a territorial condition ; its inhabitants
</p>
<p>made vassals, with no rights save those which the conqueror chooses to
</p>
<p>accord to them. Virginia! the Old Dominion! the "mother of States,"
</p>
<p>the State whose very atmosphere is sacred as having first inflated the
</p>
<p>kings that gave pulsation to the great heart of Washington ; that caught
</p>
<p>his last expiring breath, and floated his pure spirit up to the eternal
</p>
<p>throne of heaven ; the State, wliose " sacred soil'.'  yes ! sacred, indeed, not-
</p>
<p>withstanding the derision in which the word has been profaned by Aboli-
</p>
<p>tion traitors, who hate the memory of the ddve- holder Washington 
</p>
<p>above whose name Wendell Phillips, of Massachusetts, in a public lecture,
</p>
<p>has placed " on the scroll of fame," the name of Toussainl Louverture,
</p>
<p>the black demon of St. Domingo  whose sacred soil, I say, received
</p>
<p>28 "to all whom it may concern."
</p>
<p>Wasliinffton's precious mortal remains ! the State of Patrick Henry !
</p>
<p>and where his immortal words were hurled against British tyranny  " As
</p>
<p>FOR ME, GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE MR DEATH !"  the State of Jeflerson,
</p>
<p>Madison, Monroe, and a host of patriots and martyrs to civil liberty !  the
</p>
<p>State that gave to the Union  a free and princely gift  all that Northwest
</p>
<p>Territory, from which have risen some of the grandest commonwealths in
</p>
<p>the coufi'deracy !  the State, whose influence, statesmanship, and warriors,
</p>
<p>more than all others, contributed to achieve for us, and bequeathed to us,
</p>
<p>the priceless blessings of constitutional freedi>in I  this is the State, to
</p>
<p>say nothing of all the others, that Mr. Solicitor William Waiting  gorged
</p>
<p>with the swill of official patronige, puffed as a toad in his own conceit,
</p>
<p>redol(>nt of perfume from his darling Africans, with the heart of a spider,
</p>
<p>and the wisdom of a donkey  declares in five solid columns of type, must
</p>
<p>be reduced to a territorial condition ! Fellow-citizens of America, this
</p>
<p>is what is called, "unconditional" unionism !
</p>
<p>The next step was to abolitionize the army, by getting rid, under vari-
</p>
<p>ous pretexts, of as much as possible of the Democratic element among the
</p>
<p>field officers. Those who were known to be Democrats, incorruptible and
</p>
<p>true to the legitimate objects of the war, were, from time to time, removed,
</p>
<p>and their places filled with officers who sympathized with the Abolition
</p>
<p>projects of emancipation, confiscation, negro troops, and subjugation.
</p>
<p>Thus we find that McClellan, the idol of the army, who thrice saved
</p>
<p>the Capital from capture ; whose brilliant campaign in Western Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia caused him to be hailed by the public voice as the man for the occa-
</p>
<p>sion after the first Bull Run ; whose thorough military science first
</p>
<p>organized and then disciplined a splendid army, and compelled the enemy
</p>
<p>to abandon his strong position at Manassas; who, to splendid engineer-
</p>
<p>ing qualities, adds a thorough comprehension of the theory of war,
</p>
<p>understanding perfectly when caution or strategy is desirable, and when
</p>
<p>dashing impetuosity is necessary, with a temperament peculiarly adapted
</p>
<p>to eitlur; whose much-derided pick and spade enabled him to cap-
</p>
<p>ture the powerful fortifications at Yorktown with scarcely the loss of a
</p>
<p>battalion, and which .said pick and .spade have since been adopted by every
</p>
<p>general who has been succes.sful ; whose rapid movements forced the

</p>
<p>fited ; who, after driving the enemy into his capital, approached to within
</p>
<p>sight of its steeples, and who pledged his military reputation, that, if fur-
</p>
<p>nished with McDowell's Corps of forty thousand men, which had been
</p>
<p>promised him, and which was lying idly at Fredericksburg, he would march
</p>
<p>into the enemy's ca[iital in less than twelve hours after the word forward
</p>
<p>should be given ; who repelled the desperate as.sault on his left wing at Fair
</p>
<p>Oaks, although, to do so, a lack of sufficient troops required him to endan-
</p>
<p>ger his right and centre; whose brilliant achievement at Hanover Court

</p>
<p>ious, though vain hope, that the Admini.stration would give him the troops,
</p>
<p>in expectation of receiving which his military plans had been adopted; who,

<p>learn that lesson, behind the fortifications which ilcClellan's pick and

<p>spade had prepared for him around Washington  was called with trem-
</p>
<p>ulous accents, through pallid and quivering lips to save, as twice be-
</p>
<p>fore he had saved, the Capital from capture, gathered up with ama-
</p>
<p>zing rapidity the scattered, disheartened, and demoralized forces of a
</p>
<p>routed army, marched against the victorious and exultant foe, drove
</p>
<p>him from his well selected position at South Mountain, followed him rap-
</p>
<p>idly and again attacked and routed him at Antietam, thus saving Pennsyl-
</p>
<p>vania and Maryland from the devastation of invasion and the Capital
</p>
<p>from capture ; then, giving his weary soldiers a brief and ai)S()lutely
</p>
<p>necessary respite for recuperation, and to obtain shoes for their naked
</p>
<p>feet, crossed the Potomac in pursuit, took possession of the numerous

<p>Washington was an ice-bolt driven against every soldier's and civilian's
</p>
<p>heart, who still fondly clung to the hope of a restored Union under the
</p>
<p>Constitution of our Fathers, and desired to see the war conducted accord-
</p>
<p>ing to the principles of humanity and civilization.
</p>
<p>And so might fame sound her trumijet in eulogizing strains of Buell,
</p>
<p>and Fitz John Porter, and Naglee, and Andi-ew Porter, and Burns (not
</p>
<p>Burnside who distinguished himself only in capturing what was onco
</p>
<p>regarded as an impregnable fortress, to wit, the DOMICILE OF AN
</p>
<p>American citizen, and taking prisoner its garrison in the person of
</p>
<p>Clement L. Vallandigham). but a braver soldier and a better man, a
</p>
<p>gentleman as well as a soldier, who knows tlie value and loves with true
</p>
<p>devotion the institutions of his country ; and a host of others who have
</p>
<p>been suspended under various shallow pretexts.
</p>
<p>The places of these officers have been filled with some honorable excep
</p>
<p>30 "to all whom it may concern."

<p>tioii^, Imt \vlicrcv(r it \v;is practioahlc, u'ith inon wlio have provod snbsor-
</p>
<p>vicut tools and parasitcH at tlu^ footstool of power. A majority of the
</p>
<p>field officers in the higher ranks are of the stripe of Butler, Iligginson,
</p>
<p>Hunter, Shurz. Hooker, whose campaign against McClellan before the
</p>
<p>War Investigating Committee at Washington, was about as successful as
</p>
<p>his campaign against Kichniond via Chancellorsville ; and McNeill and
</p>
<p>Rousseau, who in a public speech in Pennsylvania, in the fall of 1863,
</p>
<p>spoke of the " Copperheads and traitors who go about cheering for Mc-
</p>
<p>Clellan."
</p>
<p>Having got the army iirmly in hand by means of this system among
</p>
<p>the officers, tlie Administration proceeded gradually to bolder and more
</p>
<p>shameful invtisions of the rights of the people. It would be merely su-
</p>
<p>pererogator}' to recapitulate. Not a man or woman, and scarcely a child,
</p>
<p>who is not familiar with these constantly recurring and most atrocious
</p>
<p>assaults upon the liberty of the citizen. When I use the term liberty, I
</p>
<p>do not mean licentiousness. I speak of undoubted, indefeasible rights,
</p>
<p>which Webster said belonged to the people as undoubtedly and "as natu-
</p>
<p>rally as the right to breathe, and the right to eat."
</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln boldly assumes, in his letter to tlie Ohio committee, of
</p>
<p>which Mr. Pendleton was chairman, that, in time of war, he becomes the
</p>
<p>embodiment of all three of the co-oi-dinate branches of Government  the
</p>
<p>law maker, the law interpreter, and the law executor ! He goes even a
</p>
<p>step further, and makes laws unknown to our system of jurisprudence 
</p>
<p>the law of banishment, for instance  and he executes this self-established
</p>
<p>edict daily, upon all classes of citizens, through his minions sometimes,
</p>
<p>and occasionally  as in the case of Mr. Vallandingham  by a direct order
</p>
<p>from himself. Yet Mr. Lincoln has taken a solemn oath to "preserve,
</p>
<p>protect, and defend" a Constitution whose eighth Amendment reads thus :
</p>
<p>"Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessivt; fines imposed, nor
</p>
<p>cruel and unusual punishments inHicted."
</p>

<p>from scenes of hostilities, of this solemnly declared right.
</p>
<p>The Constitution declan^s that,
</p>
<p>"la all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a
</p>
<p>speedy and pul)lic trial, by an impartial jury of the 8tate and district
</p>
<p>wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have
</p>
<p>been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and
</p>
<p>cause of the accusation ; to l)e confronted with the witnesses against
</p>
<p>him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor,
</p>
<p>and to have the assistance of counsel for his defence."
</p>
<p>Yet Mr. Lincoln has violated every one of these provisions in thou-
</p>
<p>sands of iu^laiiccs.
</p>
<p>The Con.-tliution declares that,
</p>
<p>"No person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous
</p>
<p>crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in
</p>
<p>"to aij. witom it may cokckkx." 31
</p>
<p>cases arising in tho land or naval forces, or in the mililia, when in uclual
</p>
<p>service in time of war or public danger."
</p>
<p>Yet Mr. Lincoln has violated this l>ene(ic( iit provision.
</p>
<p>' The Constitution declares (Art. 4, Amcii(liiuiit<) tluit,
</p>
<p>' The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,
</p>
<p>and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be vio-
</p>
<p>lated ; and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, sup|)orted
</p>
<p>by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched
</p>
<p>and the persons or things to be seized."
</p>
<p>Yet Mr. Lincoln has violated, in numerous instances, this wise pro-
</p>
<p>vision. The Constitution declares, in the third Amendment, that,
</p>
<p>" No soldier shall in time of peace be quartered in any house, without
</p>
<p>the consent of the owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to In- pre-
</p>
<p>scribed by law."
</p>
<p>Yet Mr. -Lincoln, through his subordinates, violated this sacred pro-
</p>
<p>visions in numerous instances.
</p>
<p>The Constitution declares, in the first Amendment, that,
</p>
<p>" Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion
</p>
<p>or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
</p>
<p>speech, or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble,
</p>
<p>and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
</p>
<p>Yet Mr. Lincoln is constantly incarcerating some, and I)ani.>liing
</p>
<p>others, whose manhood will not succumb to tyrannical usurpation, pre-
</p>
<p>ferring death itself to a craven surrender of liberty.
</p>
<p>The Constitution provides that, Congress alone shall have power to
</p>
<p>suspend the writ of habeas corpus  that great bulwark against oppres-
</p>
<p>sion. And this is manifest, from the fact that the allusion to its suspen-
</p>
<p>sion is found among the negative Congressional provisions. Tlie words
</p>
<p>are in the fourth clause of the ninth Section of Article 1, and read
</p>
<p>thus :
</p>
<p>" Th^ privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended,
</p>
<p>unless when in cases of reliellion or invasion, the pul)lic safety may re-,
</p>
<p>quire it."
</p>
<p>That is. Congress shall not have power to suspend it except in desig-

</p>
<p>nated cases, and for a specific time ; but where is the shadow of authority
</p>
<p>giving to Congress a right to delegate this stupendous power of a sweeping
</p>
<p>suspension to a co-ordinate branch of the Government, exti'nding a
</p>
<p>power, in fact, which it does not itself possess ? Monstrous perversion of
</p>
<p>the evident meaning of tlie clause ! Besides, the design evidently was,
</p>
<p>that the writ might be temporarily suspended only in districts where
</p>
<p>actual hostilities .should exist; where, in fact, ju<lieial authority migiit
</p>
<p>become too feeble, because of violent commotion in any particular dis-
</p>
<p>trict, to afford protection to the citizens.
</p>
<p>Is there any such commotion in tlie States of New York, New Jersey,
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania, or Ohio, as to render it necessary to the public safety, that
</p>
<p>every citizen of these conunonwealths shall be made liable to arrest by a
</p>
<p>deputy provost-marshal ;  perhaps, by mistake, and, perhaps, from the
</p>
<p>32 "to all whom it m\y conukrx."
</p>
<p>malice of some informant, who may seek a conveniont method of wreaking
</p>
<p>a petty vengeance ;  and the innocent victim hurried off, ignorant even
</p>
<p>of the nsiture of the accusation  thrown into a fortress, and his case, it
</p>
<p>may be, forgotten by the tyrants, through whose infamous despotism he
</p>
<p>may languish even unto death ?
</p>
<p>Hence, in his proclamation suspending the writ of habeas corpus, Mr.
</p>
<p>Lincoln has violated another provision of the Constitution.
</p>
<p>Sections, Art. 1, of the Constitution, provides " for organizing and dis-
</p>
<p>ciplining the militia, and for governing such part of tliem as may be em-
</p>
<p>ployed in the service of the United States, re^ervinsrio the States, respect-
</p>
<p>ively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the
</p>
<p>militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress."
</p>
<p>Now, no legal sophistry, or hair-splitting, can so impose upon common
</p>
<p>sense, as to induce the belief that Mr. Lincoln has not violated this pro-
</p>
<p>vision of the Constitution, by sanctioning a conscription which creates a
</p>
<p>huge consolidated army, in whose ranks, all the States ma.y be repre-
</p>
<p>sented in each company of each regiment. Thus the New York and
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania soldier, and the Vermont and Massachusetts, and Oliio and
</p>
<p>Michigan and Wisconsin men, may be mixed up in every company ; de-
</p>
<p>stroying that State identity, that State pride, that State sympathy, and,
</p>
<p>not least, that State protection, which the framers of the Constitution
</p>
<p>designed both for the efficiency of the army, in fostering State emulation,
</p>
<p>and to guard against that consolidation, which might lead to centraliza-
</p>
<p>tion aud usui-patiou of the legitimate sovereignty of the States.
</p>
<p>The Constitution requires (Section 3, Article 2d) that the President
</p>
<p>shall " take care that the laws he faithfully executed.'^
</p>
<p>May it not be asserted, truthfully, that Mr. Lincoln haw "taken care" "
</p>
<p>that the laws shall not be faithfully executed ?
</p>
<p>Witness the arrest and incarceration of that eminent jurist and fearless
</p>
<p>patriot, the venerable Judge Carmichael, for " faithfully" maintaining the
</p>
<p>law, under the responsibility imposed by his judicial oath.
</p>
<p>The Constitution declares (Section 1, Article 3) : That "the judicial
</p>
<p>power of. the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and
</p>
<p>in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and
</p>

</p>
<p>establish." And (in Section 2, of the same Article) : " The judicial power
</p>
<p>shall extend to all cases in law or equity."
</p>
<p>Yet Mr. Lincoln has violated this provision by assuming judicial powers.
</p>
<p>The Constitution (in Section 2, Article 3, 3d clause), declares that
</p>
<p>''The trial of all crimes, except in cas(\s of impeaclunent, shull be by
</p>
<p>jury, and such trial shall be held in the State, where the said crimes shall
</p>
<p>have been committed."
</p>
<p>Yet Mr. Lincoln arrests men in one State for alleged crime, and sends
</p>
<p>them to a fortress in another State, without a trial in either place ; and,
</p>
<p>furthermore, banishes men into " the enemies' country," thereby recog-
</p>
<p>nizing the Southern Confederacy, while maintaining that the States com-
</p>
<p>posing it are still within the Union, and subject to the laws of Congress,
</p>
<p>such as emancipation, confiscation, &c., &c.
</p>
<p>The Constitution declares (in Section 3, Article 3), that " no person shall
</p>
<p>" TO ALL WHOM IT MAY COXCKKN." o3
</p>
<p>be convicted of treason, unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the
</p>
<p>same overt act, or on confession in open court." Of course, the clause
</p>
<p>means, tliat if tlio conviction shall be bj'- witnesses, they shall bo examined
</p>
<p>m open court. T have heard the puerile argument advanced, that while
</p>
<p>the "confession" of an accused must be in " open court," vet if convict-
</p>
<p>ed by "witnesses," it may be before a court-martial, or a provost-mar-
</p>
<p>shal's board. To such wretchc^d shifts are tliey driven to i>alliate their
</p>
<p>iniquity, torturing and perverting the plainest language ever written.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln has clearly violated this important protection to those
</p>
<p>accused, but guiltless of the high crime of treason.
</p>
<p>The Constitution declares (in Section 3, Article 3, second clause), that
</p>
<p>"No attainder of treason shall wm-k corruption of blood, or forfeiture,
</p>
<p>except during the life of the person attainted."
</p>
<p>Yet Mr. Lincoln, by signing the Confiscation Bill of the last Congress,
</p>
<p>has violated this provision, not only in the natural and practical effect of
</p>
<p>the law, but according to the interpretation now claimed for it, by his
</p>
<p>warmest political adherents and admirers.
</p>
<p>The Constitution declares (Section 3, Article 4), that
</p>
<p>" No new State shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any
</p>
<p>other State."
</p>
<p>Yet the State of Virginia has been split in twain, so far as the abolition
</p>
<p>majority in Congress and Mr. Lincoln has been able to do it.
</p>
<p>The Constitution declares (in the second clause of Section 3, Article 4),
</p>
<p>that
</p>
<p>"Nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice
</p>
<p>any claims of the United States, or of any particular State.''^
</p>
<p>Has not the partition of Virginia "prejudiced" the claims of that "par-
</p>
<p>ticular State ?" And inasmuch as Mr. Lincoln and his followers pretend
</p>
<p>that the war is waged to restore the States, including Virginia, to the
</p>
<p>Union, what becomes of this express and emphatic declaratory clause ?
</p>
<p>In signing that bill, Mr. Lincoln violated this clause of the Constitution.
</p>
<p>Article 9 of the Amendments declares,
</p>
<p>" The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights, shall not be
</p>
<p>construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."

</p>
<p>Yet, Mr. Lincoln, either wilfully or iguorantly, has " construed"
</p>
<p>numerous important provisions according as "military necessity" or
</p>
<p>expediency, rendered it convenient, and against the interpretation of plain
</p>
<p>common sense. Witness the attempt to have the electoral vote of several
</p>
<p>States, controlled by one-tenth of the population.
</p>
<p>Article 10 of the Amendments declares that :
</p>
<p>" The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution,
</p>
<p>nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively,
</p>
<p>or to the people."
</p>
<p>Yet, the sovereign rights of the States are violated every day by Mr.
</p>
<p>Lincoln, under the plea of necessity, expediency, and by gross perversion
</p>
<p>of the language of the instrument.
</p>
<p>The Constitution provides (in Section 2, Article 4, 3d clause, ) that,
</p>
<p>3
</p>
<p>34 "to all whom it may coxceun,'"
</p>
<p>" No person hold to service or labor in one State, under the laws there-
</p>
<p>of, escaping- into another, shall, in consequence of any law or rej^ulation
</p>
<p>therein, be discliarged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered
</p>
<p>up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due."
</p>
<p>Xow, Mr. Lincoln is bound by his oath to see that this provision is just
</p>
<p>as faithfully observed in times of commotion and civil war, so far as it
</p>
<p>extends to citizens not ill rebellion against the United States, as in time
</p>
<p>of peace, yet the clause has become obsolete. In fact, the emancipation
</p>
<p>proclamation virtually wipes it out as with a sponge. Hence, Mr. Lin-
</p>
<p>coln has violated this provision.
</p>
<p>Finally, the Constitution declares (in the 2d cluuse of the 6th Article)
</p>
<p>that,
</p>
<p>" This Constitution and the laws which shall bo made in pursuance
</p>
<p>thereof," "shall In' the SUPREME law of the land; and the judges in every
</p>
<p>State shall be bound thereby, any thing in the Constitution or laws of
</p>
<p>any State to the contrary notwithstanding."
</p>
<p>And yet Mr. Lincoln has audaciously assumed that his will shall be the
</p>
<p>sovereign and supreme law. And judges in the several States who have
</p>
<p>acted in conformity with their oaths to support this provision of the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution, have been, by hirelings and parasites, denounced as traitors to
</p>
<p>their Government, and even the judicial ermine desecrated in the inflic-
</p>
<p>tion upon them of personal violence. In permitting this, Mr. Lincoln
</p>
<p>has violated the sixth Article of the Constitution.
</p>
<p>Now, my fellow-countrymen, if any of you will take a copy of the
</p>
<p>Constitution of the United States and read it carefully, you will find that
</p>
<p>there is scarcely a fragment of it left. The President and his partj^ in
</p>
<p>Congress have torn it into ribbons. Will it be said that these innova-
</p>
<p>tions are warrantable on account of the civil strife in which we are
</p>
<p>engaged. How utterly fallacious is this excuse ! These are the very
</p>
<p>times when the sacred provisions of the Constitution should be most jeal-
</p>
<p>ously guarded ; when all should cling to it as " the mariner clings to
</p>
<p>the last plank, when night and the tempest surround him." What would
</p>
<p>be thought of the commander of a vessel who, when the hurricane was
</p>
<p>raging, and his tempest-tossed bark straggling in the trough of the sea,

</p>
<p>and knowing that he was in the vicinity of dangerous reefs, should throw
</p>
<p>overboard his chart and his compass ?
</p>
<p>Time and space admonish me that I must bring this narrative to a
</p>
<p>close. A folio voIuuk; would not contain all the usurpations of this most
</p>
<p>extraordinary Administration. The servants of the people have assumed
</p>
<p>to be their masters, and have so conducted themselves during the last
</p>
<p>three years.
</p>
<p>The Hercules of American liberty is now writhing in the toils of the
</p>
<p>anaconda of despotism. Bravely the young gi;int struggles for mastery.
</p>
<p>While the slimj- coils twine round his lithe and graceful limbs, millions
</p>
<p>beh<dd the desperate encounter, and the hearts of freemen throb with al-
</p>
<p>ternate hope and fear, as their prayers ascend to Almighty God, that
</p>
<p>vititory may perch on the brow of liberty's champion, and the monster
</p>
<p>be crushed within his grasp.
</p>
<p>"to all whom ri' may conckkn." 35
</p>
<p>Mon are as nothinjj^ iu this ^vvnt crisis. Whole generations of men
</p>
<p>pass, in their ngiihir order, into tiio sepulchri- of oblivion. But few in-
</p>
<p>dividuals live, oven in memory, beyond a suee.eeding generation. Yet, in
</p>
<p>the progress of time, there are epoch.s wliich live for ages; to bo re-
</p>
<p>ferred to by posterity with eilher blessings or curses. Wo are passing
</p>
<p>tlirougli one of those periods now ! The cause of American liberty is a
</p>
<p>sacred trust, which each generation of Americans is bound by every
</p>
<p>principle of honor to transmit unimpaired to its successor. This prin-
</p>
<p>ciple must not be surrendered now. If it should, upon this generation
</p>
<p>will rest the merited execration of those that are yet in the womb of
</p>
<p>time.
</p>
<p>It is gratifying to reflect that the virtue and good sense of the Democ-
</p>
<p>racy have been so signally manifested, in the selection of those in whose
</p>
<p>persons these great principles are, as we tru-st, to be vindicated.
</p>
<p>Why should I particularly allude to those candidates, my fellow-
</p>
<p>countrymen ? You would not have me pronounce a eulogy upon George
</p>
<p>B. McClellan ! There are some things whose attractions are not en-
</p>
<p>hanced by eulogium : they speak for themselves. To say that the dia-
</p>
<p>mond is pure, and clear, and sparkling ; that no base material can corrode
</p>
<p>its fair surface, or cloud its lustre, would not enhance the ju.st admiration
</p>
<p>entertained for the jewel. Then why write words of commendation of
</p>
<p>one whose bravery and skill while iu servicis and whose modest deport-
</p>
<p>ment and good taste while in retirement, have commended themselves to
</p>
<p>every unprejudiced mind ? There he stands, clothed in the mail of a
</p>
<p>spotless reputation, from youth to vigorous manhood  invulnerable !
</p>
<p>Let the shafts of Abolition malice be hurled with all the force which im-
</p>
<p>potent rage may lend to desperation. Blunted and broken against his
</p>
<p>impenetrable armor, they fall harmless at his feet ; save only those which,
</p>
<p>glancing, inflict ghastly wounds upon his more vulnerable adversaries.
</p>
<p>As much might justly be said of George H. Pendleton : the profound
</p>
<p>lawyer  the able and fearless statesman  the C'liristian gentleman. "Who
</p>
<p>dare assail him ? Even Malice is dumb, and the tongue of Slander pal-
</p>
<p>sied in the effort !

<p>gave us candidates like these at this important crisis.
</p>
<p>The responsibility now rests with the people. See to it that every
</p>
<p>RIGHTFUL VOTE IS DEPOSITED IN THE BALLoT-iiOX. Let every man
</p>
<p>constitute himself a vigilance committee. Tlie loss of a ballot must not
</p>
<p>be thought of. The jewels that sparkle in kingly diad'ms will not com-
</p>
<p>pare in value with the American freeman's ballot on the eighth of No-
</p>
<p>vember next.
</p>
<p>Do but your duty faitlifully, my suffering fellow-countrymen, and when
</p>
<p>the morning of the ninth of November shall dav/n upon our beloved land,
</p>
<p>the shouts of exultant joy, resounding through beautiful valleys, echoing
</p>
<p>and re-echoing amidst mountain crags, reverberating through the corri-
</p>
<p>dors of the Capitol and within the chambers of the Wliite mansion,
</p>
<p>shall remind usurpers that the American people are still the sovereign
</p>
<p>people, and the only Sovereign that can be pei'mitted to reign on the
</p>
<p>sacred soil of America.
