</p>
<p>fully you may perceive by the Letters an-
</p>
<p>nexed to the 'Difcourfe. But her hate to
</p>
<p>her Husband was fo exafperated, that both
</p>
<p>her and BothwelV malice and wits, made
</p>
<p>his deflruttion their chief aim. Her carri-,
</p>
<p>age to him grew daily more and more flrange,
</p>
<p>foe augmented her neglect, in fo much that
</p>
<p>at the chriflening of that Son, who was
</p>
<p>after a 'Plague to this Nation, he was not
</p>
<p>fuffered to receive the leafl Honours or Ad-
</p>
<p>dreffes.

<p>She being again at liberty then thought

<p>a day or two before remov'd*

<p>Now was Jhe at liberty for Bothwel, but

<p>there WAS one obflacle, he had a Wife al-
</p>
<p>ready, but Jhe poor woman muft be forced
</p>
<p>to fiie out a divorce, which was procured
</p>
<p>in eight days. So that now the way was

<p>fmoothy and an Ambaffadour with fine penned

<p>inftruffions fent to the King of France, to
</p>
<p>give an account of her new Marriage " But

<p>all this could not ft ill the cries of the *Peo~

<p>pie, whofe impatience, grief, and rage at
</p>
<p>that time (particulars whereof I have feen

<p>in an^ authzntick Scotch diurnal of that

</p>
<p>in lefs than a year and an half's fpace, (no
</p>
<p>longer was att this in tranf acting] there
</p>
<p>were three known Favourites, Rize, Dar-
</p>
<p>ley, tfWBothwel ; and which of thefe might
</p>
<p>have hit luckieft may be well doubted, if-
</p>
<p>(as I have heard fbme Scots lowdly aver)
</p>
<p>the Child itfelf were not fuppoftitious.
</p>
<p>This is as much as I can fay will give
</p>
<p>light to the Book that follows. \Twas writ-
</p>
<p>ten by the mofl excellent Ten of that Age*
</p>
<p>a man as Sir Philip Sidney juftly calls him,
</p>
<p>of a fiercing wit , confummate learning ,
</p>
<p>and careful ebfervation of things, which
</p>
<p>made him known to the great eft Trinces of
</p>
<p>his time, and dear to his own. This made him
</p>
<p>School-majler to his King , wl &> im^loy d
</p>
<p>him in the weightieft Tranfaffions at home
</p>
<p>and abroad, made him Keeper, of the Prrc-y
</p>
<p>Seal of Scotland (though he never fought
</p>
<p>himfelf, nor could withdraw frcm the an-
</p>
<p>cient farfimony and frugality , he dying ve-
</p>
<p>ry poor. ) So that it is not to be flippofed
</p>
<p>that a ""Perfon 'ft well qualified for know-
</p>
<p>ledge in thefe things, and of a Reputation
</p>
<p>fo untouched, would have adventured to di-
</p>
<p>vulge matters of this nature in a place,
</p>
<p>where mofl men might have called him Lyar.
</p>
<p>But certainly both in his Hiftory, which he de-
</p>
<p>dicated to the Son, and in this 'Piece, which
</p>
<p>he penned in the name of the Lords, if
</p>
<p>there were any fault, it was too broad. And

<p>overtook her, in purpofc and hoping there

<p>to be in her company, [and to enjoy the mu-

<p>lovingly he was received of her, both all they

<p>ABOUT the 5th day of November, be-
</p>
<p>ing removed from Jedworth to a town
</p>
<p>called Calco, there fhe received letters from
</p>
<p>the King : Which when fhe had read in pre-
</p>

<p>and the Secretary, fhe caft a pitious look,

<p>and miferably tormented herfelf, as if fhe

<p>and exprefly protefted, that unlefs fhe might,
</p>
<p>by fome means or other, be difpatched of

<p>the King, me fhould never have one good
</p>
<p>day : And if by no other way fhe could at-

<p>tain it, rather than fhe would abide to live

<p>in fuch forrow, fhe would flay herfelf.
</p>
<p>WITHIN few days after, while in her

<p>return through Marchland fhe lay at Colding-
</p>
<p>ham, Dame Rerefe paffed through the watch,
</p>
<p>and was known, and let go. What company
</p>
<p>fhe had, and whither fhe went at mat time of
</p>
<p>the night, it was not unknown to the Queen.
</p>
<p>From thence, about the end of November,
</p>
<p>fhe came to Cragmiller, a caftle about two
</p>
<p>miles from Edinburgh, there, in prefence of

<p>from the Duke of Savoy. This the Queen
</p>
<p>took for a convenient colour to fend for her
</p>
<p>brother : But the true caufe of her fending
</p>
<p>for him was, that fhe had a defire to throw the
</p>
<p>fufpition of the King's murder upon him,
</p>
<p>and upon the Earl Moreton, and therewithal
</p>
<p>alfo at once to procure the deftruftion of thofe

<p>two, being men acceptable to the peril, and

<p>tended to fet up a tyrannical Government .*

<p>But Gods good clemency that had oft before
</p>
<p>delivered the Earl of Murray from many
</p>
<p>treafons of his enemies, did then alfo mani-
</p>
<p>feftly fuccour him: For upon the Sunday,
</p>
<p>which was the ninth day of February, when
</p>
<p>he was going to Church, to hear a Sermon,
</p>
<p>a Letter was brought him, that his Wife was
</p>
<p>delivered before her time, and in very fmall
</p>
<p>hope of life. When he, being difmayed at
</p>
<p>this fudden news, defired leave of the Queen
</p>
<p>to depart $ fhe anfwered, That if the caufe
</p>
<p>were fo, it were a fuperfluous journey for
</p>
<p>him to go to her, being not able to do her any
</p>
<p>good inherficknefs. But he being ftillthe more

<p>importunate, fhe prayed him, That he would

<p>yet tarry but that one night, and take his jour-
</p>
<p>ney the next day to his wife. But the mer-

<p>ipread in England, that the Earls of Murray

<p>derftanding of the matter whereof your fclf

</p>
<p>and alhcs with your eyes, you drank up the
</p>
<p>joy thereof in your heart, and the favor of

<p>-the gun-powder you in a manner muffed up
</p>
<p>at your nofe. Perhaps you meant to fend

<p>out fome to receive them that fled ; but you
</p>
<p>faw no man flee. And therefore the lights

<p>lucky aiding of the thing that you looked

<p>one of the lower room, where they had un-

<p>dermined the wall, and filled the holes with

</p>
<p>there was none of the miniftcrs that were
</p>
<p>privy to her leci;et counfels left behind, but
</p>
<p>only Alexander.'^ He, when he faw that
</p>
<p>night, no lefs doleful than fhameful, to ap-
</p>
<p>proach, prepareth, as himfelf thought, a fine
</p>
<p>fubtle excufe to be abfent, ib as rather chance
</p>
<p>might feem to have driven him out, then he
</p>
<p>himfelf willing to have forfaken his Mailer.
</p>
<p>He putteth fire in his own bed-draw, and
</p>
<p>when the flame fpread further, he made an
</p>
<p>out-cry, and threw his bedding, half finged,
</p>
<p>out of the King's chamber. But the next
</p>
<p>day, when that excufe ferved not fo handibm-
</p>
<p>ly as he deftred, for that in die Queen's hear-
</p>
<p>ing, the King very fweetly entreated him not
</p>
<p>to leave him alone that night, and alfo dc-
</p>
<p>fired him to lie with himfelf, as he had often
</p>
<p>ufcd to do, for the King entirely loved him
</p>
<p>above all the reft j Alexander in perplexity,
</p>
<p>wanting what to anfwcr, added to his firft
</p>
<p>excufe, fear of ficknefs, and pretended, that
</p>
<p>for commodious taking of Phyfick for his
</p>
<p>health, he would lie in the town. When
</p>
<p>this would not yet fervehim, the Queen added
</p>
<p>authority, and told the King, That he did
</p>
<p>not well to keep the young man with him
</p>
<p>againft the order of his health, and there-
</p>
<p>withal me turned to Alexander , and bade
</p>
<p>him go where was beft for him : And forth-

<p>And though all other things wanted, thcfe

<p>things that followed the murder do plainly

<p>others, but no man dccivcth all men, nor is
</p>
<p>deceived by all. This teftimony of the peo-
</p>
<p>ple is this. When at the Queens going abroad
</p>
<p>among the people, the greateft part of the
</p>
<p>commons were wont to make acclamations,
</p>
<p>wifhing her well and happily, with fuch
</p>
<p>fpecches as either love enforceth, or flattery
</p>
<p>fnventeth : Now at her going after the King's
</p>
<p>{laughter to the caftle, through the chief and
</p>
<p>moft populous ftreet of the town, there was
</p>
<p>all the way a fad glooming filcnce. And
</p>
<p>when any woman alone of the multitude had
</p>
<p>cryed, God fave the Queen y another by and
</p>
<p>by fo cryed out, as all men might hear her j
</p>
<p>So be it to every one as they have deftr-ved.
</p>
<p>ALBEIT thefe things were thus done as
</p>
<p>I have declared, yet there are fbmc that flick not
</p>
<p>to fay that the Queen was not only hardly, but
</p>
<p>aifo cruelly dealt with, that after fo deteftable
</p>
<p>a fad, (he was removed from her regency ; and
</p>
<p>when they could not deny the fad they com-
</p>
<p>plained of the punifhment. I do not think
</p>
<p>there will be any man fo fhamelefs to think that
</p>
<p>fo horrible a fad ought to have no punifhment
</p>
<p>at all. But if they complain of the grievoufneis
</p>
<p>of the penalty, I fear leaft, to all good men, we
</p>
<p>may feem not to have done fo gently and tem-
</p>
<p>perately, as looily and negligently, that have

<p>laid fo light a penalty upon an offence fo hei-

<p>io6 A Detection of
</p>
<p>caufc of his abfence this day, and with his
</p>
<p>power as the fame bears. The caufe of his
</p>
<p>abfence is the fhortnefs of time 5 and that he
</p>
<p>is denied of his friends and fervants, who
</p>
<p>fhould have accompanied him to his honour
</p>
<p>and fecurity of his life, in refpedt of the
</p>
<p>greatncfs of his party, and he having alfiftance
</p>
<p>of no friends but only himfelf. And there-
</p>
<p>fore his L. commanded me to defirc a fuffi-
</p>
<p>cient day , according to the weight of the
</p>
<p>caufe, therefore he may keep the fame. And
</p>
<p>if your L. will proceed at this prefent, I pro-
</p>
<p>teft that I may without any difpleafurp of any
</p>
<p>man, ufe thefe things committed to my charge
</p>
<p>by my Lord my M after. Whereof I take a
</p>
<p>document.

<p>Item, I proteft, that if the perfons who
</p>
<p>palTes upon afllze and inqueft of thefe perfons
</p>
<p>that (hall enter on pannel this day, clear the
</p>
<p>laid perfons of the murder of the King, thdP j;
</p>
<p>it fhall be willful error and not ignorance, by
</p>
<p>reafon that it is notorioufly known thofe per-
</p>
<p>fons to be the murtherers of the King, as my
</p>
<p>Lord my M after alledges, upon the which pro-

<p>I inquired of the inquifttion of Highgate, he

<p>denied the fame while I (hewed him the very-

<p>Item, I N the conclusion he confefled, he

<p>was one of the principal doers of the death,

<p>will call me a prevaricator, or prevaricating

<p>Becaufc I have (fay they) fophiflicated the ge-

<p>quite alienated the litteral, fenfc in other places

<p>by a too paraphraftical exposition. To the

<p>teen very (paring in adding ought of my

</p>
<p>who have the leaft (mattering of common

<p>fenfe, but know well enough, that it is
</p>
<p>morally impoffible for an Interpreter to make

<p>good language of any Latin piece, if he

<p>ihall always verbum verbo redere ; I mean,
</p>
<p>if he adhere fp clofe to the very rigour of
</p>
<p>original, as to think it illicite to ufe any

<p>paraphrafe, although the fuccinclneis and

<p>near as I could.

<p>THE fecond challenge is of ignorance., and

<p>that becaufe I have paflcd by fome Latin

<p>with the iniquity of the times, as that I feem

<p>to have done fomewhat : then certainly they

<p>who are born in a more happy age, and who

<p>have maturity of years, wealth and pregnan-
</p>
<p>cy of fpirit, ought not to be deterred by pair>s

<p>from noble defigns, nor can fuch deipair be-

<p>therefore go on with vigour to illuftrate learn-

<p>their nation to the memory of after ages,

<p>and poilcrity, yea if they would but beftir

<p>come to pafs, that they would eradicate out of

<p>had converfcd in France, concerning our af-

</p>
<p>velty of affairs (as is ufual) would give oc-
</p>
<p>cafion and matter of difcourfc thereof to all.
</p>
<p>Why ( faith he ) do you defire that of me >
</p>
<p>For feeing you are well acquainted with the
</p>
<p>courfe of affairs, and is not ignorant what
</p>
<p>the moft part of men do {peak, and what
</p>
<p>they think, you may cafdy guefs in your own

<p>opinion of all.
</p>
<p>B. BUT .the farther that foreign nations arc
</p>
<p>at a diftanc'e, they have the lefs cauics of
</p>
<p>wrath, hatred, love and other perturbations,
</p>
<p>which may ' divert the mind from truth, and
</p>
<p>for the moft part they fo much the more

<p>judge of things fincerely, and freely (peak

<p>out what they think : That very freedom of

<p>fp caking and conferring the thoughts of the

<p>difcovers intricacies, confirm doubts, and may

<p>by my own conftant pradice, or the moral
</p>
<p>precepts of the moft learned, yet when I
</p>
<p>came to fall upon the prefent cafe, I know not
</p>
<p>how I could conceal my pufillanimity. For
</p>
<p>when that horrid villany not long fince here
</p>
<p>perpetrate, all with one voice did abominate
</p>
<p>it, the author hereof not being known 5
</p>
<p>the multitude which is more afted by preci-
</p>
<p>pitancy, than ruled by deliberation, did charge
</p>
<p>the fault of fome few upon all ; and the com-
</p>
<p>mon hatred of a particular did redound to the
</p>
<p>whole nation, fo that even (iich as were moft
</p>
<p>remote from any fufpicion, were inflamed
</p>
<p>with the infamy of men's crimes. When there-
</p>
<p>fore this ftonn of calumny was calmed, I be-
</p>
<p>took my {elf very willingly in this port,
</p>
<p>wherein notwithstanding I am afraid, I may
</p>
<p>dafh upon a rock.
</p>
<p>B. WHY, I pray you ?

<p>M. BECAUSE the atrocioufnefs of that late

<p>crime doth feem fo much to inflame the

<p>minds of all already exaiperate, that now no

<p>place of apology is left. For, how mall I

<p>neither the weaknefs of fex, not innocency
</p>
<p>of age will reftrain ? equity, cuftom, laws,

<p>the refped to Sovereignty, reverence of law-

<p>when the power of fuprcam authority is ex-

<p>pofed tp the ludibry of the bafeft of the peo-
</p>
<p>ple, the difference of equity and iniqui-
</p>
<p>ty, of honefty and diflionefty being once
</p>
<p>taken away, almoft by a publick confcnt,
</p>
<p>there is a degeneracy into cruel barbarity. I

<p>or fatisfadion.

<p>fear, and our nation from that falle crime. For,

<p>if they do fo much dcteft the atrocioufncfs

<p>of the firft crime, how can they rationally re-

<p>take it ill, that the Queen is taken order with,
</p>
<p>they muft needs approve the firft deed ;

<p>choofe you then, which of the two would
</p>
<p>you have to feem cruel. For neither they

<p>170 The due Privilege of
</p>
<p>of that guilt, and that it is charged upon the
</p>
<p>wickednefs of iomc few. But this laft fact
</p>
<p>I can neither allow nor difallow, for it
</p>
<p>feems to me a famous and memorable deed,
</p>
<p>that by counfcl and diligence they have fearch-
</p>
<p>ed out that villany, which fmce the memory
</p>
<p>of man is the moft heinous, and do purltie
</p>
<p>the perpetrators in a hoftile manner. But in
</p>
<p>that they have taken order with the chief
</p>
<p>Majcftratc, and put contempt upon Sove-
</p>
<p>reignty, which amongft all nations hath been
</p>
<p>always accounted great and facred. I know
</p>
<p>not how all the nations of Europe will relifh
</p>
<p>it, especially fuch as live under kingly Go-
</p>
<p>vernment 5 furely the greatnefs and novelty
</p>
<p>of the fact doth put me to a demur, albeit I

<p>might come to pafs, as in many other cafes ?

<p>M. I F all would confefs that Tyrants arc

<p>made open to us for the reft, but I find fome

<p>men, and thefe not of imall authority, who

<p>while they make Kings liable to the penalties

</p>
<p>pofterous judgment, if I be not miftaken, yet
</p>
<p>-they are ready to maintain their Goverment,
</p>
<p>albeit immoderate and intolerable, as if they
</p>
<p>Avere to fight for things both facred and

<p>B. I have alfo met with feveral Perfons of-

</p>
<p>and common utility did allure them ?
</p>
<p>M. FORSOOTH I believe that ; feeing it
</p>
<p>is confonant to the courfc and order of na-
</p>
<p>ture, and is tcftified by all the Hiftorics of all na-
</p>
<p>tions almoft, for Homer doth defcribe the re-
</p>
<p>prefentation of fnch a wild and barbarous kind
</p>
<p>of life in Sicily > even in the time of the Tro-
</p>
<p>jans. Their Courts (faith he) do neither abound
</p>
<p>with Councils nor Judges, they dwell only
</p>
<p>in darkfome caves, and every one of them in
</p>
<p>high mountains ruleth his own houfe, wife
</p>
<p>and children, nor is any of them at leifure
</p>
<p>to communicate his domeftick affairs to any
</p>
<p>other. About the fame time alfo Italy is faid
</p>
<p>to be no better civilifed, as we may eafily con-
</p>
<p>jedure from the moft fertile regions almoft
</p>
<p>of the whole world, how great the folitude

<p>and waftnefs there was in places on this fide
</p>
<p>of Italy.
</p>
<p>B. B u T whether do you think the vagrant

<p>and folitary life, or the alfociations of men

<p>civilly incorporate, moft agreeable to nature ?

</p>
<p>M. WHY not, feeing I have heard from
</p>
<p>the learned, that men are born for men ?
</p>
<p>B. UTILITY indeed in fome fcems ve-
</p>
<p>ry efficacious, both in beginning and conferv-
</p>
<p>ing the publick fociety of mankind 5 but if I
</p>
<p>miflakc not, there is a far more venerable, or
</p>
<p>ancient caufe of mens aflbciating, and a more
</p>
<p>antecedaneous and facrcd bond of their civil
</p>
<p>community, otherwile, if every one would
</p>
<p>have a regard to his own private advantage,
</p>
<p>then furely that very utility would rather difc
</p>
<p>folve than unite human fociety together.
</p>
<p>M. PERHAPS that may be true, there-
</p>
<p>fore I defire to know what other caufe you
</p>
<p>will aflign.
</p>
<p>B. A certain inftinct of nature, not only
</p>
<p>in man, but alfo in the more tamed fort of
</p>
<p>beafts, that although thefe allurements of uti-
</p>
<p>lity be not in them, yet do they of their own
</p>
<p>accord flock together with other beafts of
</p>
<p>their own kind : but of thefc others we have
</p>
<p>no ground of debate 3 furely we fee this in-
</p>
<p>ftind by nature fo deeply rooted in man,
</p>
<p>that if any one had the affluence of all things,
</p>
<p>which contribute either for maintaining health,
</p>
<p>or pleafure and delight of mind, yet he will
</p>
<p>think his life unpleafant without human con-
</p>

<p>remit the fame, could they live in folimde,

<p>their very fecret ftudies, and as they had la-
</p>
<p>boured for the publick good, they did com-
</p>
<p>municate to all the fruit of their labour. But:
</p>
<p>if there be any man who doth wholly take
</p>
<p>delight in folitude, and flee from converfe
</p>
<p>with men, and fhun it, I judge it doth ra-
</p>
<p>ther proceed from a diftemper of the mind,
</p>
<p>than from any inftind of nature, fuch as we
</p>
<p>have heard of Timon the Athenian, and Bel-
</p>
<p>lerophon the Corinthian, who (as the Poet
</p>
<p>faith) was a wandering wretch on the E-
</p>
<p>lean coalr, eating his own heart, and fleeing
</p>
<p>the very footfteps of men.
</p>
<p>M. I do not in this much diflent from

<p>you, but there is one word nature here fet

<p>out of cuftom, than that I underftand it, and

<p>apply it.

<p>no other thing to be understood thereby, than

<p>that LIGHT infufedby God into our minds \

<p>another. Moreover, God hath given us ail

</p>
<p>M. I am not very anxious about his name,

<p>for by what name foever he be called, I think

<p>a fun&ion in it felf very great and excellent.

<p>by that name. For we have no other more

<p>of a Phyfician is, I am of the opinion, we fhall

<p>not much miftake the duty of a King.

<p>which is extenuate and tenderly chcrifhing it,

</p>
<p>dy politick as well as the natural hath its own

<p>proper temperament, which I think very right-

<p>ly we may call Juftice. For it is that which
</p>
<p>doth regard every member, and cureth it fo
</p>
<p>as to be kept in its function. This fomc-
</p>
<p>times is done by letting of blood, fometimes

<p>by the expelling of hurtful things, as by e-

</p>
<p>feem to claim thcfc parts.
</p>
<p>B. I think it is no great matter on which
</p>
<p>of them you confer this honour. For fee-
</p>
<p>ing all vertues, whereof the ftrength is beft
</p>
<p>perceived in a&ion, are placed in a certain

<p>mediocrity and equability, fo are they in feme

<p>meafure connc&ed amongft themfelves, and
</p>
<p>cohere, fo as it feerns to be but one office
</p>
<p>in all, that i$, the moderation of lufts. Now
</p>
<p>iji whatfoever kind this moderation is, it is
</p>
<p>no great matter how it be denominate ; al-
</p>
<p>beit that moderation, which is placed in pub-
</p>
<p>lick matters, and mens mutual commerces,
</p>
<p>doth fecm mofi fitly to be unc|erftood by the

<p>name of Juflice.

<p>M. HEREIN I very willingly afTcnt to

<p>you.
</p>
<p>B. I N the creation of a King, I think the
</p>
<p>ancients have followed this way, that if any
</p>
<p>among the citizens were of any fingular ex-
</p>
<p>cellency, and fcemed to exceed all others in
</p>
<p>equity and prudence, as is reported to be done
</p>
<p>in beehives, they willingly conferred, the go-

<p>think that he is a lawful King >
</p>
<p>M. MOST lawful, for the people have
</p>
<p>power to confer the Government on whom
</p>
<p>they pleafe.
</p>
<p>B. WHAT if we fhall admit Ibme acute
</p>
<p>man, yet not endowed with notable skill,

<p>for curing difeafes ? (hall we prefently account
</p>
<p>him a Phyfician, as foon as he is chofen by
</p>
<p>all?
</p>
<p>M. NOT at all , for by learning and the
</p>
<p>experience of many arts, and not by fufFrages
</p>
<p>is a man made a Phyfician.

<p>B. CAN you give me a reafon why you

<p>think fo ?

<p>M. I think I can, namely that fame which

<p>is ufually given in other Arts.

<p>B. WHAT is that?

<p>M. You do not then think that a King

<p>fhould have an arbitrary power over aU

<p>things ?
</p>
<p>B. NOT at all: For I remember, that he
</p>
<p>is not only a King, but alfo a man, erring
</p>
<p>in many things by ignorance, often failing
</p>
<p>willingly, doing many things by constraint >
</p>
<p>yea a creature eafily changeable at the blaft of
</p>
<p>every favour or frown, which natural vice a

</p>
<p>I chiefly find that of the Comedy made true,
</p>
<p>AIL by licence become worfe. Wherefore the
</p>
<p>moft prudent have thought it expedient to
</p>
<p>adjoyn to him a law, which may either fliew
</p>
<p>him the way, if he be ignorant, or bring

<p>him back again into the way, if he wander

<p>out of it : By thefe, I fuppofe, you under-

<p>be the duty of a true King.

<p>there is one thing which in all your difcourfe

<p>and the City of Venice.
</p>
<p>B. You did not rightly herein judge of
</p>
<p>me : For I do not fo much look to the diffe-
</p>
<p>rent form of civil Government (fuch as was
</p>
<p>amongft the Romans, Maffilians, Venetians,
</p>
<p>and others, amongft whom the authority of
</p>
<p>laws were more powerful, than that of men)
</p>
<p>as to the equity of the form of Government ?
</p>
<p>nor do I think it matters much, whether
</p>
<p>King, Duke, Emperour, or Conful, be the
</p>
<p>jiame of him who is the chiefeft in authori-
</p>
<p>ty, provided this be granted, that he is placed
</p>
<p>In the magiftracy for the maintenance of
</p>
<p>equity ; for if the government be lawful, we
</p>
<p>muft not contend for the name thereof: For
</p>
<p>he whom we call the Duke of Venice is
</p>
<p>is nothing elfe but a lawful King ; and the
</p>
<p>firft Corifuls did not only retain the honours
</p>
<p>of Kings, but alfo their empire and authority j
</p>
<p>This only was the difference, that riot one, ;
</p>
<p>but two of them did reign (which alfo yoii
</p>
<p>know was ufual in all the Lacedemonian
</p>
<p>Kings) who were created or chofen, not con-
</p>
<p>ftantly to continue in the government, but
</p>
<p>for one year. We muft therefore always
</p>
<p>ftand to what we fpoke at firft, that Kings
</p>
<p>at firft were inflituted for maintaining equity.
</p>
<p>If they could have holden that fovereignty
</p>
<p>in the cafe they had received it, they might
</p>
<p>have holden and kept it perpetually 5 but this

<p>humane things) the ftate of affairs tending
</p>
<p>to worfe, the fovereign authority which was
</p>
<p>ordained fop publick utility degenerated into
</p>
<p>a proud domination. For when the luft of
</p>
<p>Kings flood in ftead of laws, and men being
</p>
<p>veftcd with an infinite and immoderate pow-
</p>
<p>er, did not contain themfelves within bound,
</p>
<p>but connived at many things out of favour,
</p>
<p>hatred, or felf-intcreft, the infolency of
</p>
<p>Kings made laws to be deflred. For this
</p>
<p>caufc, therefore, laws were made by the peo-
</p>
<p>ple, and Kings conftrained to make ufe, not
</p>
<p>of their own licentious wills in judgment*
</p>
<p>but of that right or privilege which the peo-
</p>
<p>ple had conferred upon them : For they were
</p>
<p>taught by many experiences, that it was bet-
</p>
<p>ter that their liberty fhould be concredited to
</p>
<p>laws, than to Kings ; whereas the one might
</p>
<p>decline many ways from the truth, but the
</p>
<p>other being deaf both to intreaties and threats,
</p>
<p>might ftill keep one and the fame tenor.
</p>
<p>This one way of government is to Kings
</p>
<p>prefcribcd, otherwise free, that they fhould
</p>
<p>conform their adions and fpeech to the pre-
</p>
<p>fcripts of laws, and by the fandions thereof
</p>
<p>divide rewards and punifhments, the greateft

<p>bonds of holding faft together humane fo-

<p>which is the moft glorious both with God

<p>and man, into its own fplendor, either of

<p>your own accord, or at my defire, in the

<p>feries of your difcourfe, which being fpoiled
</p>
<p>of all ornaments, you have brought it into

<p>fubjedion ; and that authority, which through

<p>all the world is the chiefeft, you having
</p>
<p>hedged in round about and made it almoft
</p>
<p>fo contemptible, as not to be defired by
</p>
<p>any man in his right wits : For what man

<p>in his right wits would not rather live as a

<p>B. CONSIDER, I pray you, in how
</p>
<p>great an errour you are, who docs think
</p>
<p>that Kings were created by people and na-
</p>
<p>tions, not for juftice, but for pleafure, and
</p>
<p>does think there can be no honour, where
</p>
<p>wealth and pleafures abound not; wherein
</p>
<p>confider how much you dirhihiih their gran-
</p>
<p>deur. Now that you may the more eafily
</p>
<p>underftand it, compare any one King of thofe
</p>
<p>you have feen apparalled like a child's puppet,
</p>
<p>brought forth with a great deal of pride, and a
</p>
<p>great many attendants, meerly for vain oftenta-
</p>
<p>tion, the reprefentation whereof you mifs in
</p>
<p>that King whom we defcribe : Compare, .1
</p>
<p>fay, fome one of thofe, who were famous
</p>
<p>of old, whofe memory doth even yet live,
</p>
<p>flourifheth, and is renowned to all pofterity.
</p>
<p>Indeed they were fuch as I have now been

<p>defcribing. Have you never heard what ail

<p>find none of them comparable to thofe, ei-

<p>ther for prudence, fortitude, or activity -, few
</p>
<p>equal to them for largenefs of dominions,
</p>
<p>If I fhould enumerate Agefilaus, Leonidat^
</p>
<p>and the reft of the Lacedemonian Kings (O
</p>
<p>how great men were they !) I fhall feem
</p>
<p>to utter but obfolete examples : Yet one fay-
</p>
<p>ing of a Lacedemonian maid I cannot pals
</p>
<p>over with itlence ; her name was Gorgo, the
</p>
<p>daughter of Cleomedes : She feeing a lervant
</p>
<p>pulling off the {lockings of an Afian Gueft,
</p>
<p>and running to her father, cried out, fa-
</p>
<p>ther ', the Gueji hath no hands* From which
</p>
<p>fpeech of that maid you may eafily judge
</p>
<p>of the Lacedemonian difcipline,. and dome-

<p>ftick cuftom of their Kings. Now thofe
</p>
<p>who proceeded out of this ruftrck, but cou-

<p>For I defire to fhew you with the firft

<p>what I promifed, namely, that this form of

<p>government hath not been contrived by nie^
</p>
<p>but feems to have been the fame to the mbft
</p>
<p>famous men in all ages, and I mail briefly
</p>
<p>fhew you the fpring from whence I have

</p>
<p>inoft praife- worthy j in the Second Betok
</p>
<p>thereof thefe words are let down verbatim:
</p>
<p>tc It feems (as Herodotus faith) that of ol^
</p>
<p>" well-bred Kings were cheated, not amefngft'
</p>
<p>" the Medes only, but alfo smongft our

<p>* ancestors, for executing t>f juftice ; for'

<p>*' the loweft, by equal laws to botk And

<p>" the reafon of making laws, was the fame

<p>" as of the creation of Kings 5 for it is fe-

<p>03 B. FIRST

<p>I p8 The due Privilege of
</p>
<p>B. FIRST of all then we agree, that men
</p>
<p>by nature are made to live in fociety togCr
</p>
<p>flier, and for a communion of life.
</p>
<p>M. THAT is agreed upon.
</p>
<p>B. THAT a King alfp chofen to maintain
</p>
<p>that fociety is a man eminent in vertue.
</p>
<p>M. I T is i o.
</p>
<p>B. AND as the difcords of men amongft
</p>
<p>themfelves brought in the neceility of crea-
</p>
<p>ting a King, fo the injuries of King's done a-
</p>
<p>gainft their Subjects were the caufe of defiring
</p>
<p>Jlaws.
</p>
<p>M. I acknowledge that.
</p>
<p>B. WE held Laws to be a proof of the
</p>
<p>Art of Government, even as the precepts of
</p>
<p>Phyfick are of the medicinal art.

<p>M. If is foj

<p>B, B U T itTeems to be more fafe ( becaufe
</p>
<p>in neither of the two have we fet down any .

<p>fmguiar and exact: skill of their feveral Arts )
</p>
<p>that both do, as fpeedily as may be, heal by
</p>
<p>thcfe prefcripts of Ait.
</p>
<p>M. IT is indeed fafeft.
</p>
<p>B. N p \v the precepts of the medicinal

<p>Art are not pf one kind.
</p>
<p>M. How?
</p>
<p>B. FOR lame of them are for prefervati-
</p>
<p>pn o'f health, others for reftoration thereof.

</p>
<p>B. NEXT then it feems, that we confi-
</p>
<p>der it. Do you think that Phyficians can Ib
</p>
<p>exactly have skill of all difeafes, and of their
</p>
<p>remedies, as nothing more can be required
</p>
<p>for their cure ?
</p>
<p>M. NOT at all, for many new kinds of
</p>
<p>difeafes arife almoft in every age, and new
</p>
<p>remedies for each of them, almoft every
</p>
<p>year are by men's induury found out, or
</p>
<p>brought from far countries.
</p>
<p>B. W H A T think you of the Laws of com-
</p>
<p>monwealths.
</p>
<p>M. S URELY their cafe feems to be the
</p>
<p>fame.
</p>
<p>B. THEREFORE neither Phyficians,
</p>
<p>nor Kings can evite or cure all difeafes of
</p>
<p>commonwealth, by the precepts of their
</p>
<p>Aits, which are delivered to them in writ.
</p>
<p>M. I think indeed they cannot.
</p>
<p>$. WHAT if we fhall farther try of what
</p>
<p>things Laws may be eftablifhed in common-
</p>
<p>wealths, and what cannot be comprehended
</p>
<p>within Laws.
</p>
<p>M. THAT will be worth our pains.
</p>
<p>B. THERE feems to be very many and
</p>
<p>weighty things, which cannot be contained
</p>
<p>within the Laws. Firft, All fuch things as

<p>fall into the deliberation of the time to come.

<p>200 The due Privilege of
</p>
<p>- M. YES, indeed.
</p>
<p>B IN unfolding than thefc qucftions what
</p>
<p>ihall the King do ?
</p>
<p>M. I fee here there is no need of a long
</p>
<p>difcourfe, feeing Kings do not fo arrogate the
</p>
<p>fupream power in thofe things which arc infti-
</p>
<p>tute with refpecl: to the time to come, that
</p>
<p>of their own accord they call to council
</p>
<p>fome of the moft prudent.
</p>
<p>B. WHAT fay you of thofe things which
</p>
<p>by conjedures are found out, and made out
</p>
<p>by witneffes, fuch as are the crimes of mur-
</p>
<p>ther, adultery and witchcraft.
</p>
<p>M. THESE are examined by the skill of
</p>
<p>Lawyers, difcoyered by diligence,, and thefe I
</p>
<p>find to be for the moft part left to the judg-
</p>
<p>ment of [udges.
</p>
<p>B. A N D perhaps very right ; for if a King
</p>
<p>would needs be at the private caufes of each
</p>
<p>Subject, when fhall he have time to think
</p>
<p>upon peace and war, and thofe affairs which
</p>
<p>maintain and preferve the fafety of the com-
</p>
<p>monwealth ? And laftly,when fhall he get leave
</p>
<p>to reft?
</p>
<p>^/.NEITHER would I have the cogni-
</p>
<p>tion of every thing to be brought unto a
</p>
<p>King, neither can one man be fumcient for
</p>
<p>all the caufes of all men, if they be brought
</p>
<p>unto him ; that counfel no lefs wife than ne-

<p>caufes, whereof I fhall not fpeak much, fee-
</p>
<p>ing the hiftory is known to all.

<p>.5. BUT I think, thcfc Judges muft judge
</p>
<p>according to law.
</p>
<p>M. T HE Y muft indeed do fo. But as I
</p>
<p>conceive, there be but few things, which by
</p>
<p>Laws may be provided againft, in refped: of
</p>
<p>thofe which cannot be provided againft.
</p>
<p>B. THERE is another thing of no lels
</p>
<p>difficulty, becaufe all thefe things which call
</p>
<p>for Laws, cannot be comprehended by cer-
</p>
<p>tain prefer! ptions.
</p>
<p>M How fo?
</p>
<p>B. LAWYERS, who attribute very much
</p>
<p>to their own Art, and who would be account-
</p>
<p>ed the Priefts of Juftice, do confefs that there
</p>
<p>is fo great a multitude of affairs, that it may
</p>
<p>feem almoft infinite, and fay that daily arife
</p>
<p>new crimes in Cities, as it were feveral kinds
</p>
<p>of ulcers, what fhall a Lawgiver do herein,,
</p>
<p>who doth accommodate Laws both to things
</p>
<p>prefent and preterit ?
</p>
<p>M. NOT much, unlefs he be fome di-
</p>
<p>vine-like perfon.
</p>
<p>B. AN other difficulty doth alfo occur, and
</p>
<p>that not a fmall one, that in fo great an in-
</p>
<p>conftancy of humane frailty, no art can al-
</p>
<p>moft prefcribe any things altogether ftable and
</p>
<p>firm.
</p>
<p>M. THERE is nothing more true than
</p>
<p>that.

<p>B. I T feemeth then moft fafe to truft a
</p>
<p>skilful Phyfician in the health of the patient,
</p>
<p>and alfo the Rings in the ftate of the com-
</p>
<p>monwealth. For a Phyfician without the
</p>
<p>rule of art will oftentimes cure a weak pa-
</p>
<p>tient either confenting thereto, or againft his
</p>
<p>will 5 and a King doth either perfwade a new

<p>law yet ufeful to his Subjects, or elfe may im-
</p>
<p>pofe it againft tlieir will.
</p>
<p>M. I do not fee what may hinder him
</p>
<p>therein.
</p>
<p>B. Now feeing both the one and the o-
</p>
<p>ther do thefe things, do you think that beitdes
</p>
<p>the Law, either of them makes his own
</p>
<p>Law?
</p>
<p>M. IT feems that both doth it by Art.
</p>
<p>For we have before concluded not that to be
</p>
<p>Art which confifts of precepts, but vertue
</p>
<p>contained in the mind, which the artift ufual-
</p>
<p>ly makes ufe of in handling the matter which

<p>is fubject to arts. Now I am glad ( feeing

<p>you fpeak ingenuoufly ) that you being con-
</p>
<p>ftrained, as it were, by an interdiction of the
</p>
<p>very truth, do fo far reftore th King from
</p>
<p>whence he was by force dejected.
</p>
<p>B. STAY, you have not yet heard all.
</p>
<p>There is another inconvenient in the autho-
</p>
<p>rity of Laws, For the law being as it were a
</p>
<p>pertinacious, and a certain rude exactor of

<p>The law is deaf, cruel and inexorable, A

<p>the law to thefe excufes ? Go officer or ferje-

<p>for confirming their memory, and putting o-

<p>let us rant that a King is at liberty and fol-

<p>ved from the laws, Hull we grant him the

<p>power to command laws ? For no man will

<p>willingly lay bonds and fetters upon himfelf.
</p>
<p>And I know not whether it be better to leave

<p>a man without bonds, or to fetter him with

<p>flight bonds, becaufe he may rid himfelf there-

<p>of when he pleafes.

<p>King's duty will be to advert that the Law
</p>
<p>may reach that rule I fpoke of, but you in

<p>behalf of Kings feems to require more, than
</p>
<p>the moft imperious of them alTume. For you

<p>know that this kind of queftions is ufually de-

<p>moft grievous contentions of advocates arife

<p>But in this cafe no lefs wrong feems to be

<p>better to end that debate prefently from the

<p>B. T H A T all things arc to be fo freely
</p>
<p>granted to an excellent King, as we have de-
</p>
<p>fcribed him, that there might be no need of
</p>
<p>any Laws. But whilft this honour is confer-
</p>
<p>cd to one of the people, who is not much
</p>
<p>more excellent than others, or even inferi-
</p>
<p>our to fome, that free and loofe licence from
</p>
<p>laws is dangerous.,,
</p>
<p>M. B u T what ill doth that to the inter-
</p>
<p>pretation of law.
</p>
<p>B. VERY much. Perhaps you do not
</p>
<p>confider, that in other words we reftore to
</p>
<p>him that infinite and immoderate power,
</p>
<p>which formerly we denied to a King, name-
</p>
<p>ly that according to J^is own heart's lufl he
</p>
<p>may turn all things upfide down.
</p>
<p>M. IF I do that, then certainly I do it im-
</p>
<p>prudently.
</p>
<p>B. I fhall tell you more plainly, that you
</p>
<p>may underftand it. When you grant the in-
</p>
<p>terpretation of laws to a King, you grant him
</p>
<p>fuch a' licence, as the law doth not tell what
</p>
<p>the Lawgiver mean eth, or what is good and
</p>
<p>equal for all in general but what may make
</p>
<p>for the interpreter's benefit, fo that he may
</p>
<p>bend it to all adions for his own benefit
</p>
<p>or advantage, as the Lesbian rule. Af. Clau-

</p>
<p>berty you give a Prince by one caft, namely
</p>
<p>that what he pleafcth the law doth fay, what
</p>
<p>pleafcth him not, it doth not fay. If we mail
</p>
<p>once admit this, it will be to no purpofe to
</p>
<p>make good laws for teaching a good prince
</p>
<p>his duty 5 and him in an ill King. Yea, let
</p>
<p>me tell you more plainly, it would be better
</p>
<p>to have no laws at all, than that freedom to
</p>
<p>fleal fhould be tolerate, and alfo honoured
</p>
<p>under pretext of law.
</p>
<p>M. D o you think that any King will be
</p>
<p>fo imprudent, that he will not at all have any
</p>
<p>regard of the fame and opinion that all men
</p>
<p>have of him ? or that he will be fo forgetful
</p>
<p>of his fubjeds, that lie will degenerate into

<p>their praviry, whom he hath restrained by ig-

<p>and in a word with very grievous punifriments?

<p>2 1 4. The due Privilege of
</p>
<p>know that no Icfs can be feared by unwary
</p>
<p>perfons. At firft, laws were propofed to us,
</p>
<p>not only drawn out of the innermoft fecrets of
</p>
<p>nature, but given by God himfelf, explained
</p>
<p>by the prophets from the holy Spirit, at laft
</p>
<p>by the Son of God, and by the fame God con-
</p>
<p>firmed, committed to the writings of thofe
</p>
<p>praife worthy men, exprefled in their life,
</p>
<p>and fealed with their blood. Neither is there
</p>
<p>in the whole law any other place more care-
</p>
<p>fully, commendably, or more clearly deli-
</p>
<p>vered, than that of the office of Bifhops.
</p>
<p>Now feeing it is lawful to no man to add any
</p>
<p>thing to thefe laws, to abrogate or derogate
</p>
<p>ought therefrom, or to change any thing
</p>
<p>therein, there did remain but one interpre-
</p>
<p>tation, and whiJft the Pope did arrogate it,
</p>
<p>he not only did opprefs the reft of the
</p>
<p>Churches, but claimed a tyranny the moft
</p>
<p>cruel of all that ever were, daring to com-
</p>
<p>mand not only men but Angels alfo, plainly
</p>
<p>reducing Chrift into order, if this be not to
</p>
<p>reduce him into order, that what thou wilt
</p>
<p>have done in heaven, in earth and amongft
</p>
<p>the damned in hell, be ratified ; what Chrift
</p>
<p>hath commanded, let it be ratified, if thou wilt

</p>
<p>M. I have heard thefe things often before,
</p>
<p>but I defire to hear more plainly iomcwhat
</p>
<p>of that interpretation of laws.
</p>
<p>B. I fhall offer you one example, from
</p>
<p>which you may eafily underftand, how mucli
</p>
<p>this whole kind is able to do. The law is, A
</p>
<p>Bifhop muft be the husband of one wife, than
</p>
<p>which law what is more clear, and what may
</p>
<p>be faid more plain ? one wife, ( faith the Law )
</p>
<p>one Church, (faith the Pope) fuch is his
</p>
<p>interpretation. As if that law were made not
</p>
<p>to reprcfs the luft of Bifhops but their ava-
</p>
<p>rice. Now this explanation, albeit it faith no-
</p>
<p>thing to the purpofe, yet doth contain a judg-
</p>
<p>ment honeft and pious, if he had not vitiated
</p>
<p>that law again by another interpretation. What
</p>
<p>doth therefore the Pope devife for excufe ? It
</p>
<p>varieth ( faith he ) in regard of perfons, ca-
</p>
<p>fes, places and times. Some are of that emi-
</p>
<p>nent difpofition, that no number of Churches
</p>
<p>can fatisfie their pride. Some Churches a-
</p>
<p>gain are fo poor, that they cannot maintain
</p>
<p>him who was lately a begging Monk, if he
</p>
<p>now have a mitre, if he would maintain the
</p>
<p>name of a Bifhop. There is a rcafon in-

<p>vented from that crafty interpretation of the
</p>
<p>law, that they may be called Bifhops of one
</p>
<p>Church, or other Churches given them in
</p>
<p>Commendam, and all may be robbed. Time
</p>
<p>would fail me, if I Ihould reckon up the
</p>
<p>cheats, which arc daily excogitat againft one
</p>
<p>law. But albeit thefc things be moft unbc-
</p>
<p>fecming as well the name of a Pope, as of a
</p>
<p>Chriilian, yet their tyranny refts not here :
</p>
<p>For fuch is the nature of all things, that
</p>
<p>when they once begin to fall, they never
</p>
<p>ftay until they fall headlong into deftrudion.
</p>
<p>Will you have me to fhpw you this by a
</p>
<p>famous example ? Do you not remember up-
</p>
<p>on any of the Roman Emperours blood,
</p>
<p>who was more cruel and wicked than C,

<p>for preheminence of impiety.

<p>thcmfelvcs, if they had been plcafed to ex-
</p>
<p>ercife that office, or could have done it by
</p>
<p>realbn of greater affairs.
</p>
<p>B. As forthofc Roman Empcrours, whom ^
</p>
<p>the Soldiers did chufe indelibcratcly., and ,
</p>
<p>without any regard to the common good
</p>
<p>of all, thefe fall not under this notion of
</p>
<p>Kings which we have defcribed fo that by
</p>
<p>thofe that were mod wicked were they cho-
</p>
<p>ien who for the moft part were moil wic-
</p>
<p>ked, or elfe laid hold upon the Government
</p>
<p>by violence. Now I do not reprehend them
</p>
<p>for granting power to lawyers to interpret
</p>
<p>the law. And albeit that power be very
</p>
<p>great, as I have faid before, it is notwith-
</p>
<p>ftanding more fafely concrcdited to them to
</p>
<p>whom it cannot be an inurument of tyran-
</p>
<p>ny. Moreover it was concreditcd to many
</p>
<p>whom mutual reverence did hold within the
</p>
<p>bounds of duty, that if one decline from
</p>
<p>equity, he might be refuted by another. And
</p>
<p>if they Ihould have all agreed together into

<p>fraud 5 the help of the judge was above
</p>
<p>them, who was not obliged to hold for law
</p>
<p>whatever was given by Lawyers for an
</p>
<p>anfwer. And over all was the Emperour,
</p>
<p>who might punilh the breach of laws. They
</p>
<p>being aftrided by fo many bonds were hem-

<p>what unwillingly I feem to have confented,

<p>being enforced by the ftrcngth of truth.

<p>taken from a King the power of command-

<p>ing laws, but alfo of interpreting them, e-
</p>
<p>ven whilft I as an advocate ftrongly pro-

<p>tefled againft it. Wherein I am afraid, if

<p>the matter come to publick hearing, left I

<p>M. I do remember we did ib indeed. And
</p>
<p>when you was doing that, wot you what
</p>
<p>came into my mind ?
</p>
<p>B. How can I, unlcfs you tell me ?
</p>
<p>M. METHOUHGT you made Kings in a
</p>
<p>manner like ftone feals, which for the moft
</p>
<p>part fo feem to lean on the tops of pillars, as
</p>
<p>if they did fuftain the whole fabrick : where-
</p>
<p>as in effed they bear no more burden, than
</p>
<p>any other ftone.
</p>
<p>B. WHAT? good advocate of Kings, do
</p>
<p>you complain that I lay on them a little bur-
</p>
<p>den, teeing both day and night they do no-
</p>
<p>thing elfe, than fcek out others to bear bur-
</p>
<p>den with them, or upon whom they may
</p>
<p>altogether lay the burden, and fo disburden

<p>themfelvcs. And in the mean time you fcem
</p>
<p>to take it in ill part that I afford them help

<p>labouring under their burden.

<p>but not command, fuch as may fhew the way,

<p>but not lead in the way, or more truly draw,

<p>or rufh them forward as fomc warlike en-

<p>to afifent to them. Therefore I prefently ex-

<p>pect, that having ended our diicourfc con-

<p>B. Y o u feared, as you pretend, the crime
</p>
<p>of prevarication ; but I am afraid, left in ca-
</p>
<p>lumniating you wrong the King, whom you
</p>
<p>endeavour to defend. Firft, I would not have

<p>him to be idle, unlels you would appoint

<p>idle mafter- builders : Secondly, you deprive
</p>
<p>him of good minifters and friends, whom I
</p>
<p>have adjoyned unto him, not as keepers, but
</p>
<p>would have them called by him to bear a

<p>part of his labour; and thefe being driven
</p>
<p>away, you furround him with a band of

<p>knaves, who make him to be feared by his

<p>formidable, unlefs we allow him a great

<p>power of doing wrong. I would have him

<p>to be by his fubjccls beloved 5 not to be guard-

<p>ed by the terrour, but good-will of his fub-
</p>
<p>jeds, which arms alone do make Kings in-

<p>fhall fhortly prove it : For I fhall lead him

<p>by one law ihall give him fo much autho-

<p>222 The due Privilege of
</p>
<p>B. I fhall then fall upon that matter, that
</p>
<p>I may fatisfy your defire as foon as I can.
</p>
<p>A little before we have confdTcd, that no
</p>
<p>law can be fo accurately cautioned concern-
</p>
<p>ing any affair, but that malicious fubtilty
</p>
<p>may invent fbme fraud. This, perhaps, will
</p>
<p>be the better underftood by the example al-
</p>
<p>ready propofed. By the law it is ordained,
</p>
<p>that no parents tranfmit their benefices to
</p>
<p>their baftards. Here, in etfeft, the law feems
</p>
<p>clear, yet a cheat is found out ; that the fa-
</p>
<p>ther fubftitute fome other man, and that he
</p>
<p>may deliver that fame benefice to the baftard
</p>
<p>of the former pofleflbr. Thereafter, when
</p>
<p>as it was carefully ordained by law, that the
</p>
<p>fon fhould by no means enjoy that benefice
</p>
<p>which his father had poflefled before ; yet
</p>
<p>by this caution it was never a whit the bet-
</p>
<p>ter : For againft that law a paftion was found
</p>
<p>out amongft priefts, that each of them fhould
</p>
<p>fubftitute the fon of the other in his office.
</p>
<p>And when that was alfo forbidden, the law
</p>
<p>was alfo eluded by another kind of cheat :
</p>
<p>A pretender was let up againft the father,
</p>
<p>who might pretend he had a right to that
</p>
<p>benefice. Whilft the father feemingly is a
</p>
<p>contending with this fuppofed fycophant,
</p>
<p>the fon doth petition the Pope for the be-
</p>
<p>nefice, if fo be that the right unto that be-
</p>
<p>nefice belong not to either of the parties
</p>
<p>contending for it; and fo the fon, by his

<p>father's prevarication, doth enjoy his father's

<p>who willingly and freely yield up their plea.
</p>
<p>Thus you ice how many kinds of cheats are

<p>invented againft one law.
</p>
<p>M. 1 fee it.

<p>B. D o not lawgivers feem to do altoge-
</p>
<p>ther the fame herein which phyficians do,
</p>
<p>who whilft they endeavour by applying a
</p>
<p>plaifter to compefce the eruptions of flegm,
</p>
<p>or of fomc other hurtful humour, the hu-
</p>
<p>mour reflrained in one^ place feeks iflue in

<p>many places at once ; and, as a certain Hy-

<p>dra, having one head cut off, many heads
</p>
<p>-ftart up in place of one.

<p>M. NOTHING more like.

<p>there would be need of few laws.

<p>more for the publick good who can apply

<p>wickedly and arrogantly, but by intreaty en-
</p>
<p>deavour to obtain, hath a far greater force,

<p>furfers nothing to lie hid in obfcurity, and

<p>they had laid wafte, whofe cities they had

<p>burnt, and their children and kinfmen they
</p>
<p>had carried away into bondage. Now if iri

<p>to a true King, that is to the lively image of

<p>ons of life, with what great care and folicitude
</p>
<p>fhould men forefee, that the tender minds of
</p>
<p>Kings be rightly principled, even from their
</p>
<p>very infancy. For feeing many are the bene-
</p>
<p>fits of good Kings towards their Sub-
</p>
<p>jeds, and contrary- wife, many calamities
</p>
<p>proceed from wicked Princes, than nothing
</p>
<p>doth feem to have a greater influence upon
</p>
<p>every rank of men, than the carriage and con-
</p>
<p>verfation of Kings and others, who jointly
</p>
<p>rule publick affairs. For what is done well

<p>or ill by private perfons, is for the mofl part

<p>hid from the multitude ; or by reafon of iuch

<p>mens obfcure condition their example belong-

<p>thofe, who hold the helm of publick af-

</p>
<p>it were in a publick monument, as Horace

<p>by very kindly allurements of utility. And

<p>whither focver the inclinations of Kings do

<p>^for her likenefs, that it was the end of a moft

<p>V/ ifr/rants cmbracin g tna t falfe reprefentation of a
</p>
<p>/(j? ^Kingdom, when they have once obtained it
</p>
<p>by right or wrong, cannot lofe it without de-

<p>ftrudion. Now if any do admonifh them,
</p>
<p>that the true Helena for whom they imagine

<p>to fight, is elfewhere concealed, they would

<p>call him mad.

<p>caufe they dcfpifed her. TAnd therefore fee-
</p>
<p>ing we are fallen in to make mention of Ty-
</p>
<p>rants, may it pleafe you, that {freight way we
</p>
<p>proceed to fpeak of them ? j
</p>
<p>M* YES, unlefs you think fome other
</p>
<p>thing fhould be firft fpoken.
</p>
<p>B. I fuppofe we (hall not deviate, if we
</p>
<p>proceed in the fame footftcps for finding out a
</p>
<p>Tyrant, wherein we did infill in feeking out
</p>
<p>a King.
</p>
<p>M. I think fo. For by that means we (hall
</p>
<p>very cafily underftand what difference there is
</p>
<p>betwixt them, if fct one againft another they
</p>
<p>be duly confidered.
</p>
<p>B. AND firft of all that we may begin at
</p>
<p>a Tyrant's name, of what language, it is un-
</p>
<p>certain. I therefore think it now necefiary
</p>
<p>for us to feek therein the Greek or Latin
</p>
<p>Etymology. Now what the ancients did call
</p>
<p>Tyj^Qny- I think is not unknown to any
</p>
<p>who are well verfed in human literature. Foe
</p>
<p>Tyrants were called both by the Greeks and
</p>
<p>Latincs, who had the full power of all things
</p>
<p>in their hands, which power was not aftrid-
</p>
<p>ed by any bonds of Laws, nor obnoxious to
</p>
<p>the cognition of Judges. Therefore in both

<p>languages, as you know, not only the noble

<p>heroes, and moft famous men, but the chief-
</p>
<p>eft of the Gods, and fo Jupiter alfo is called

<p>think and fpeak honourably of the Gods.

<p>M. i
</p>
<p>234 The due Privilege of
</p>
<p>M. I know indeed that well enough 5 and
</p>
<p>the rather I much admire, whence it is come
</p>
<p>to pafs, that that name now for fo many ages
</p>
<p>is accounted odious, and alfo amongft the
</p>
<p>moft grievous reproaches.
</p>
<p>B. I T fcems certainly to have fallen out in
</p>
<p>this word, which happeneth to be in many
</p>
<p>others $ for if you confider the nature of
</p>
<p>words, it hath no evil in it. And albeit fome
</p>
<p>words have a more pleafant found in the ears
</p>
<p>of hearers, and others a more unpleafant, yet
</p>
<p>of themielves they have no fuch thing, fo as
</p>
<p>to ftir up the mind to wrath x hatred, or hi-
</p>
<p>larity, or otherwiie to create pleafure or pain
</p>
<p>and trouble. If any fuch thing befall us, that
</p>
<p>happens to fall out ufually, not from the
</p>
<p>-word, but from the confuetude of men, and
</p>
<p>image thereof conceived by the hearers.
</p>
<p>Therefore a word which amongft fome men
</p>
<p>is honeft, amongft others cannot be heard
</p>
<p>without fome preface of, with reverence.
</p>
<p>M. I remember that the like is befallen the
</p>
<p>names of Nero and Judas, whereof the one
</p>
<p>amongft the Romans, and the other amongft
</p>
<p>the Jews was accounted by great men very
</p>
<p>famous and honourable. But thereafter by
</p>
<p>no fault of thefe names, but of thefe two men,
</p>
<p>it hath come to pafs, that even the moft fla-
</p>
<p>gitious men will not have thefe names to be
</p>

<p>the Scots Government.
</p>
<p>B. T H E fame alfo is perfpicaous to have
</p>
<p>befallen the word Tyrant, for it is credible*
</p>
<p>that the firft Magiftrates, who were thus cal-
</p>
<p>led, were good men : or from hence, that
</p>
<p>this name was ibmetime fo honourable, that
</p>
<p>it was attribute to the Gods. But thofe that
</p>
<p>came afterward made it fo infamous by their
</p>
<p>wicked deeds, that all men abhorred it as
</p>
<p>.contagious and peftilentious, and thought it a
</p>
<p>more light reproach to be called an hang- man
</p>
<p>than a Tyrant.
</p>
<p>M. PERHAPS it was the fame as befell
</p>
<p>the Kings in Rome after the Tarquinii were
</p>
<p>depofed in the name Ttiffor after, M. An-
</p>
<p>toniu* and f P. T)olabeUa were Confute.
</p>
<p>B. JUST fo. And on the contrary, bafc
</p>
<p>and vulgar names have been made famous by
</p>
<p>the vertue of men called thereby. As amongft
</p>
<p>the Romans, Camillas ', Meteltus, Scrofha :
</p>
<p>and amongft the Germans, Henry, Genferick,
</p>
<p>Charles, This you ihall the better under-
</p>
<p>ftand, if taking away the name of Tyrant,
</p>
<p>you confidcr the thing, notwithftanding that
</p>
<p>this kind of government hath continued in
</p>
<p>its former honour and relped amongft many
</p>
<p>famous nations, as the ^/Efymnette amongft
</p>
<p>the Grecians, and the T) iff at or s amongft the
</p>
<p>Romans; for both were lawful Tyrants.
</p>
<p>Now Tyrants they were, being more power-
</p>
<p>ful than the laws ; but lawful they were, as
</p>
<p>being chofen by confent of the people.

<p>M, WHAT

<p>2 36 The due Privilege of
</p>
<p>M. WHAT am I hearing ? Tyrants and
</p>
<p>yet lawful ? Indeed I did expect a far other
</p>
<p>thing from you ; l?ut now you feejn to con-
</p>
<p>found the differences of all Kings and Ty-
</p>
<p>rants.
</p>
<p>B. INDEED both Kings and Tyrants a-
</p>
<p>mongft the ancients feem to have been alto-
</p>
<p>gether one and the fame 5 but I fuppofc in di-
</p>
<p>vcrie ages 5 for I think the. name of Tyrants
</p>
<p>were more ancient ; thereafter when they be-
</p>
<p>came weary of the name, in their place fuc-
</p>
<p>cceded Kings by a more plaufiblc name, and
</p>
<p>more gentle government, and when they al-
</p>
<p>ib began to degenerate , the moderation of
</p>
<p>laws were adhibited, which might fct limits
</p>
<p>to the boundlefs lufts of their government.
</p>
<p>Now men according to the exigence of times,
</p>
<p>and their ufual way, fecking out new reme-
</p>
<p>dies became weary of the old way of govern-
</p>
<p>ment, and fought out new ways. Now our
</p>
<p>prefent purpofe is to handle both kinds of go-
</p>
<p>vernment, namely that wherein as well the
</p>
<p>the government of Kings as of laws is die
</p>
<p>moil powerful 5 and the worft kind of Ty-
</p>
<p>ranny, wherein all things are contrary to a
</p>
<p>Kingdom, and have undertaken to compare
</p>
<p>them one with another.
</p>
<p>M. I T is fo. And I eariieftly expect you
</p>
<p>would fall upon that.
</p>
<p>B. AT firlr. then we had agreed, that a
</p>
<p>King \vas created for maintaining human Co-
</p>
<p>cicty, and we determined his office and duty,

<p>the Scots Government. 237
</p>
<p>that by the prefcript of laws he fhould allow
</p>
<p>every man his own.
</p>
<p>M. I do remember that.
</p>
<p>B. FIRST then, he that doth not re-
</p>
<p>ceive a government by the will of the peo-
</p>
<p>ple, but by force invadeth it, or intcrcept-
</p>
<p>cth it by fraud, how fhall we call him >
</p>
<p>M. I fuppofe, a Tyrant.
</p>
<p>B. THERE be alfo many other differences,
</p>
<p>which 1 mall briefly run through, becaufe any
</p>
<p>man may cafilly colled them from Ariftfft'l'e ;
</p>
<p>for the government of Kings is according to
</p>
<p>nature, but that of Tyrants is not A King
</p>
<p>doth rule his fubjeds, and reign over them
</p>
<p>by their own confent. Tyrants reign over;
</p>
<p>them nill they, will they. A Kingdom is a
</p>
<p>principality of a free man among free men :
</p>
<p>Tyranny is a principality of a M after over
</p>
<p>his (laves. For defence of a Kings fafcty the
</p>
<p>fubjects watch and ward, for a Tyrant for-
</p>
<p>rainers do watch to opprefs the fubjects. The
</p>
<p>one beareth rule for the fubjecls welfare, the
</p>
<p>other for himiclf.
</p>
<p>M. WHAT do you fay of thofe who have
</p>
<p>gotten into their hand th fupream authority
</p>
<p>by force and without the people's confent, and
</p>
<p>yet for many years did 16 rule, that the peo-
</p>
<p>ple were not weary of their government ?
</p>
<p>for what could be wanting in Htera the Syra-
</p>
<p>cufan King, or in Cofmo de Me dices the Flo-
</p>
<p>rentine Duke to make them jufl Kings, ex-
</p>
<p>cept the people's fuff rages ?

<p>238 The due Privilege of

<p>B. I N D E E D we cannot excme them out;
</p>
<p>of the number of Tyrants. For it was nobly
</p>
<p>fpoken by a notable Hiftorian, albeit you may
</p>
<p>indeed rule your country arid friends by via-
</p>
<p>Jence and force, and corred their faults, yet
</p>
<p>it is unfcalbnablc. Then again, fuch do iccm-
</p>
<p>to do juft like robbers, who cunningly .di-
</p>
<p>viding their ill gotten goods, do fcek the praifc
</p>
<p>of juftice by injury, and of liberality by rob-
</p>
<p>bery, yet do not obtain what they hunt for $
</p>
<p>by the odioufnefs of one ill deed they lofe all
</p>
<p>the thanks of their (tentative bounty, and fo
</p>
<p>much the lefs afiiirance of their civil diipofi-
</p>
<p>tion do they give their fubjeds, and that be--
</p>
<p>caufe they do not that for their fubjeds good,
</p>
<p>but for their own government, namely, that
</p>
<p>they the more fecurcly may enjoy their own
</p>
<p>lufts and pleafures, and eflablifh a fovercignty
</p>
<p>over the pofterity to come, having Ibmcwhat
</p>
<p>mitigated the people's hatred. Which when
</p>
<p>they have once done, they turn back again
</p>
<p>to their old manners. For the fruit which is
</p>
<p>to follow may eafily be known by the fowetf
</p>
<p>thereof. For he hath the fame ftrength and
</p>
<p>power to revoke all things at his pleafure, and
</p>
<p>to transfer unto himfelf the ftrength of all laws.
</p>
<p>F vcn as if he wou'd abrogate all laws. But this
</p>
<p>kind of Tyrants had been perhaps tolerable, if
</p>
<p>without the common deftrudion of all it could
</p>
<p>have been taken away, even as we do endure
</p>
<p>fome bodily difeafes rather than throw our life

<p>Who bear rule, not for their country's good, but

<p>for their own felf interefts, have no regard to the
</p>
<p>publick utility, but to their own pleafure and

<p>luft, they place the (lability of their authority in

<p>the people's weakness, and think that a King-
</p>
<p>dom is not a procuration coneredited to them'

<p>by God, but rather a prey put into their

<p>hands. Such are not joined to us by any
</p>
<p>civil bond, or bond of humanity, but fhould
</p>
<p>be accounted the greatefl enemies of God and
</p>
<p>of all men. For all the actions of Kings
</p>
<p>fnould aim at the publick fafety of their fub-
</p>
<p>jeds, and not at their own wealth. By how
</p>
<p>much Kings are raifed above other men, fo
</p>
<p>much mould they imitate the ccleftial bodies,
</p>
<p>which having no good offices of ours given
</p>
<p>to them, yet do infufe on human affairs a
</p>
<p>vital and bountiful vertue of heat and light.
</p>
<p>Yea the very titles wherewith we have ho-
</p>
<p>noured Kings ( if you remember ) might put
</p>
<p>them in mind of their munificence.

<p>M. ME THINKS I remember, namely, that

<p>they fhould ufe a paternal indulgence towards

<p>in by your preceeding difcourfe you feemed

<p>tranfgrefied the limits of human fociety.
</p>
<p>B. WHAT fay you of thofe, who would

<p>never once enter within thefe hedges ?

<p>to thofc who have killed wolves or bears,

<p>monfter fhould be born, and ipeak with a

<p>man's voice, and have the face of a man,
</p>
<p>and likenefs of other parts, I would have no

<p>of humanity fhould degenerate into fuch

<p>fhould be called a man no more than Satyres,

<p>Apes, or Bears, albeit they fhould refemble

<p>by the poets is fpoken of the furies, and by

<p>our divines of the nature of evil fpirits,

<p>namely that thefe fpirits are enemies of man-

<p>kind, who whilft they are in perpetual tor-

</p>
<p>This is indeed the true Idea of Tyranny. But

<p>indeed is that life which Tyrants embrace as

<p>tortures of confcience, but alfo is awaked out

<p>of his fleep by terrifying fights both of the

<p>living and dead, and agitate by the fire-brands

<p>things very acutely, but I know not if truly

<p>to be no lefs hereditary, that their will and

<p>veral great authors, with whom I am not a-
</p>
<p>ihamed to be miftaken, ( if at all I be in any

<p>neck for all the people of Rome. Now in
</p>
<p>that Emperor there was nothing of a man,
</p>
<p>far lefs of a King, befide his fhape, you are
</p>
<p>not then ignorant how much authority may
</p>
<p>be due to him. But as for the royal law,
</p>
<p>what it is, when, by whom, and in what
</p>
<p>words it was made, the very Lawyers make no
</p>
<p>mention. For that power was never in any
</p>
<p>of the Roman Emperors, feeing from them
</p>
<p>appeals were made to the people. But that
</p>
<p>ordinance, whereby L. Flaccus 1 having op-
</p>
<p>prefled the liberty of the people of Rome,
</p>
<p>eftablifhed by the filence of other laws j the
</p>
<p>Tyranny of L. Sylla, no man did ever hold
</p>
<p>for a law. For of that ordinance fuch was
</p>
<p>the ftrength, that whatever L. Sylla had done,
</p>
<p>fhould be ratified, which law never any free
</p>
<p>people was Ib infatuate, as willingly to per-

<p>were, he were indeed worthy to ferve perpe-

<p>M. INDEED you admonifh well. But
</p>
<p>that admonition helongeth to them in whofe
</p>
<p>power it is to create fuch Kings as moft pleafc
</p>
<p>them, but to us it doth not at all belong, who
</p>
<p>do not by fufFrages cleft the beft Kings, but
</p>
<p>accept of thofe that by chance are given us.
</p>
<p>That alfo of a certain Lawyer feems proper-
</p>
<p>ly to quadrate with us, who have given to
</p>
<p>our King's Anceftors that right and authority
</p>
<p>over us and our pofterity, that they and their

<p>pofterity fhould perpetually hold their Empire

<p>admonifhed them ( I mean our Anceftors )
</p>
<p>who once had it in their own power entirely

<p>to admit fuch Kings as they pleafed. But now
</p>
<p>that counfel of yours too late ferves only for

<p>this, not to amend the faults that are not in

<p>and acknowledge the mifery of our conditi-

</p>
<p>becaufe it was approved by Juftinian a very
</p>
<p>juft Prince. With whom fo plain flattery
</p>
<p>would not have had place. For with a fooliih
</p>
<p>Prince, of the Poet would prevail that whom
</p>
<p>dothfalfe honour help, or lying infamy terrtfie,
</p>
<p>but a lewd man and a lyar ?
</p>
<p>B. INDEED Juftinian, as hiftory reports,
</p>
<p>was a great mighty man albeit fome do re-
</p>
<p>port him to have been cruelly ingrate to Bel-
</p>
<p>le far ins. But let him be fuch as you judge
</p>
<p>he was, yet you may remember, that it is
</p>
<p>recorded by fome almoft of that fame age
</p>
<p>with him, that Tribonitts, a chief man amongft
</p>
<p>the compilers of thefe laws, was a very wick-
</p>
<p>ed man, and fo might eafily be induced to
</p>
<p>gratifie alfo a very bad Prince. But even
</p>
<p>good Princes do not hate this kind of flat-
</p>
<p>tery. For even thofe who will not kill any
</p>
<p>man^ do yet defire to have it in their power ',
</p>
<p>and there is nothing which he dare not believe
</p>
<p>of himfelfy feeing his power equal to that
</p>
<p>of the Gods is commended. But let us return
</p>
<p>to our own Princes ; to whom you fay the

<p>Kingdom doth come by inheritance and not

<p>by furfrages. Now of our own only I ipeak,

<p>firft principles. This is fufficiently agreed

<p>upon, that our Princes were chofen for their

<p>virtue, who would govern others.
</p>
<p>M. S o do the writers of our affairs re-
</p>
<p>cord.
</p>
<p>B. NOR is this lefs known, that many
</p>
<p>who have reigned cruelly and wickedly have
</p>
<p>been called to account by their fubje&s 5
</p>
<p>fome adjudged to perpetual imprifonment,
</p>
<p>others punifhed partly by exile, and partly by
</p>
<p>death, againft whofc killers no inquifition
</p>
<p>was ever made, even when their fons or
</p>
<p>kinfmen were affiimed into their ftead. But
</p>
<p>who ever had killed good Kings, were moft
</p>
<p>feverely punifhed, fo as no where elfe was
</p>
<p>murthcr more feverely revenged. And be-
</p>
<p>caufc it would be tedious to rehearfe every
</p>
<p>one, I fhall produce fbme Few of thefe laft
</p>
<p>Kings, whofe memory is moft recent. The
</p>
<p>nobility did fo grievoufly punifhthe murther
</p>
<p>of James the firft, ( having left as heir his fon
</p>
<p>of fix years of age ) that by a new and exqui-
</p>
<p>iite kind of punifhment they put to death fe-
</p>
<p>veral perfons of very eminent families, and
</p>
<p>peers of the land, both for wealth and vafla-
</p>
<p>lage eminent : On the contrary, who did

<p>flagitious and cruel ? far lefs revenge it ? But

<p>clined

</p>
<p>clined towards good Kings, but alfo gentle
</p>
<p>and merciful towards wicked Kings. For
</p>
<p>when one of King Cuteris enemies had kil-
</p>
<p>led him in his journey, whilft he is coming
</p>
<p>to give an account of his adminiftration, he
</p>
<p>was fevercly puniflied by a fentence of the
</p>
<p>Eftates of Parliament. And likewife was
</p>
<p>puniflied as an enemy he who had killed
</p>
<p>E*venus in prifon, who had been adjudged
</p>
<p>to perpetual bonds. And the violent death
</p>
<p>or parricide of him they puniflied, whofe
</p>
<p>wicked and vicious life all men had hated.
</p>
<p>M. I do not fo much enquire at prefent
</p>
<p>what fome time hath been done, as by what
</p>
<p>right Kings reign amongft us.
</p>
<p>B. THAT we may therefore return there-
</p>
<p>unto, as in our firft Kings until Kenneth the
</p>
<p>third, who firft fetled the kingdom in his
</p>
<p>own family, it is very clear what was the
</p>
<p>peoples power in creating their Kings, and
</p>
<p>taking order with them, even fo it is necef-
</p>
<p>fary we know, that he either did that againft

<p>the peoples will, or by perlwafiorT obtained
</p>
<p>it.
</p>
<p>M> THAT cannot be denied.

</p>
<p>the people to obey him, then how foon the

<p>people began to have confidence in their own

<p>was once agreed they were to be in ?

</p>
<p>greement, what excute there is for undoing
</p>
<p>the fame. I fhall on the other hand lay
</p>
<p>down fome reafons why padions and agree-

<p>that it fhould be kept for pupils, and fuch

<p>floweth far abroad into all the members of

<p>B. I T is alfo credible, that fo great a
</p>
<p>matter was not obtained without ibme great
</p>
<p>caufe.
</p>
<p>M. I do eafily afient thereto.
</p>
<p>E. WHAT do you think was the chief
</p>
<p>caufe thereof?
</p>
<p>M. WHAT other, except that which is
</p>
<p>recorded? Wearifomnefs of ambition, tu-
</p>
<p>mults, murthers, intcftine wars, often with
</p>
<p>the utter deftruction of the one party, and
</p>
<p>always with very great damage of both :
</p>
<p>For fuch as did obtain the Government,
</p>
<p>endeavoured to cut off their brethren, and
</p>
<p>almoft all their near kinfmen, that they
</p>
<p>might leave the Government the more peace-
</p>
<p>able to their children, even as we hear is
</p>
<p>done amongft the Turks, and as we fee a-
</p>
<p>mongft the chief of Clans in our Hlands,

<p>and in Ireland.

<p>family. M. THAT
</p>
<p>252 The due Privilege of
</p>
<p>M. THAT is very probable.
</p>
<p>B. Now that they might obtain that
</p>
<p>which did fo much concern the perpetual
</p>
<p>dignity, wealth and fafety of their family,
</p>
<p>it is probable, that they did difpenfe or re-
</p>
<p>mit to one another fomewhat of their right :
</p>
<p>and that they might the more eafily obtain
</p>
<p>the peoples good will, liking and confent,'
</p>
<p>they on their part gave them fome cafe.
</p>
<p>M. I believe that.
</p>
<p>B. Y o u will certainly confefs it incredi-
</p>
<p>ble, that for fo great a benefit beftowed on
</p>
<p>their Kings, they fhould endure to be in a
</p>
<p>worfc cafe than formerly they were in.
</p>
<p>M. I T is altogether incredible.
</p>
<p>B. N E i T H E k would Kings have defired
</p>
<p>it with fo great ambition, if they had known
</p>
<p>it would prove hurtful to their children, and
</p>
<p>unprofitable to the people.
</p>
<p>M. -N o T at all.
</p>
<p>B. IMAGINE then that fome one in
</p>
<p>parliament of the free people did freely ask
</p>
<p>the King, What if to any King fhould fuc-
</p>
<p>ceed a fon that is a fool, or mad ? Will
</p>
<p>you fet fuch over us to rule us, who cannot
</p>
<p>rule or govern themfelves ?
</p>
<p>M. I think there was no need to make
</p>
<p>ufe of that pxception, feeing by the laws it
</p>
<p>is provided againft fuch a cafe.
</p>
<p>B. WELL faid, indeed. Let us then
</p>
<p>fee, if Kings had obtained from the people
</p>
<p>a free power over the laws, whether that

</p>
<p>had been unprofitable, efpecially to thofc
</p>
<p>who defired to forefee the good of their
</p>
<p>own family in time coming.
</p>
<p>M. W H Y (hall we think that that power
</p>
<p>would be unprofitable?
</p>
<p>B. BECAUSE nothing doth fo much
</p>
<p>contribute for the continuance of a Govern-
</p>
<p>ment, as that temperament of Government,
</p>
<p>feeing it is both honourable for Kings, and
</p>
<p>moderate and fafe for the people. The mind
</p>
<p>of man hath fomewhat fublime and generous
</p>
<p>imbred therein by nature, that it will obey
</p>
<p>none, unlefs he govern profitably : Nor is
</p>
<p>there any thing more prevalent for maintain-
</p>
<p>ing human fociety, than the mutual exchange
</p>
<p>of benefits, and therefore Theopompus feems _^-
</p>
<p>to have wifely anfwered his wife upbraiding
</p>
<p>him, that by adding the Efhory he had di-
</p>
<p>minimed the power of his authority, and
</p>
<p>had left the Kingdom to his fons lefs than he
</p>
<p>had gotten it. It is, faith he, fo much the
</p>
<p>more frm and fur e.
</p>
<p>M. WHAT you relate of continuance, I
</p>
<p>perceive is moft true. For I think the King-
</p>
<p>doms of the Scots and T>anes are the moft
</p>
<p>ancient of all that are in Europe, nor do
</p>
<p>they feem by any other means to have attain-
</p>
<p>ed that antiquity, than by the moderation of
</p>
<p>the fupreme authority, whilft in the mean

</p>
<p>of one family into another. But I do not know
</p>
<p>if our Kings have been fo wife as Theopompus.
</p>
<p>B. A s they have not been fo prudent, do
</p>
<p>you imagine that the people were fo foolifh,
</p>
<p>as to negled an occafion fo opportune put
</p>
<p>into their hand ? Or that they were fo ftruck
</p>
<p>with fear, or feduced by flatteries, as to give
</p>
<p>themfelves over into flavery willingly ?
</p>
<p>M. PERHAPS it was not. But if the
</p>
<p>people (which indeed might be) were fo
</p>
<p>blind, that they did not fee what might con-
</p>
<p>cern their own good, or being carelefs would
</p>
<p>not fee what might be for their benefit, fo
</p>
<p>as to contemn it, fhould they not then be
</p>
<p>juftly puniihed for their folly ?
</p>
<p>B. I T is not probable, that any fuch thing
</p>
<p>was done, feeing we may fee the contrary
</p>
<p>to be obferved even to our days. For befides
</p>
<p>that wicked Kings, as often as they intended
</p>
<p>tyranny over their fubjects, were always re-
</p>
<p>ftrained, fome veftiges of the ancient cuftoms
</p>
<p>do yet continue in fome ancient families.
</p>
<p>For the old Scots even to our very days do
</p>
<p>chufe their heads of Clans, and having cho-
</p>
<p>fen them, do give them a Council of Elders,
</p>
<p>to which Council whofoever gives not obe-
</p>
<p>dience, is deprived of all honour and dignity.
</p>
<p>What therefore is with very great care ob-
</p>
<p>ferved in the parts, would they be negligent
</p>
<p>of for the fecurity and fafety of all ? And

<p>would they freely give over their liberty ac-
</p>
<p>quired by rertue, defended by arms, not in-
</p>
<p>terrupted for fo many ages, to one not ex-
</p>
<p>pecting it, without force, without war ? For
</p>
<p>the calamity of John Baliol doth fhew that
</p>
<p>that power was never granted to our Kings,
</p>
<p>befides the punifhments fo often taken for
</p>
<p>their male-adminiftration. Who about two
</p>
<p>hundred and fixty years ago was by the nobility
</p>
<p>rejected, becaufe he had fubjeded himfelf and
</p>
<p>his Kingdom to the authority of Edward
</p>
<p>King of England, and Robert the fi*ft was
</p>
<p>fubftitute in his ftead. The fame doth alfb
</p>
<p>fhew that perpetual cuftom continued from
</p>
<p>the beginning of our Government.
</p>
<p>M. WHAT cuftom do you fpeak of?
</p>
<p>B. WHEN our Kings are publickly in-
</p>
<p>augurat, they folemnly promife to all the
</p>
<p>people, that they will obferve the laws, rites,
</p>
<p>and old ftatutes of their predecefibrs, and ufe
</p>
<p>the fame power which they have received
</p>
<p>from them, that whole order of ceremonies
</p>
<p>doth fhew, and the firft entry of our Kings
</p>
<p>into every City, from all which it may be
</p>
<p>eafily underftood, what kind of power they
</p>
<p>did receive from our predeceflbrs, to wit,
</p>
<p>none other than that they fwear to maintain
</p>
<p>the laws being chofen by fuffrages. This
</p>
<p>condition of reigning did God propofe to
</p>
<p>'David, and his pofterity, and promifeth they
</p>

<p>Jaws he had given them, thofe things indeed
</p>
<p>they do, as is probable that our Kings re-
</p>
<p>ceived from our anceftors a power not im-
</p>
<p>menfe, but within certain limits bounded
</p>
<p>and limited. And further, there was the
</p>
<p>confirmation of a long time, and the ufur-
</p>
<p>pation of a perpetual right by the people,
</p>
<p>never reprehended by a publicjk decree.
</p>
<p>M. Burl fear it cannot be eafily obtain-
</p>
<p>ed of Kings as being perfwaded by that pro-
</p>
<p>bability to condefcend to thefe laws, however
</p>
<p>fworn unto, or ufurped by the people.
</p>
<p>B. I alfo believe, it is no lefs hard to per-
</p>
<p>fwade the people to pafs from the right re-
</p>
<p>ceived from their anceftors, approved by the
</p>
<p>ufe of fo many ages, and pradifed by one
</p>
<p>continual tenour. I do not think it needful
</p>
<p>to proceed by conjectures what the people is
</p>
<p>to do, fince I fee what they have done alrea-
</p>
<p>dy : But if by the obftinate pertinacy of both
</p>
<p>the bufinefs come to arms, he that prevaileth
</p>
<p>will give what law and right he pleafeth to
</p>
<p>the vanquifhed j but this will not longer con-
</p>
<p>tinue than he who is vanquifhed, having a-

<p>gain gathered together his forces, mall take

<p>up arms again. In all which contentions
</p>
<p>men ufually (till fight with very great damage

<p>of the people, but with the utter overthrow

<p>of Kings. For from this Ipring do flow all

<p>the deftrudions of all kingdoms.

<p>nature of fome difeafes,- that better it is to

<p>troubles me more is, I fee that government
</p>
<p>which you call Tyranny confirmed by the

<p>word of God, and what you abhor as the
</p>
<p>utter overthrow of laws, God doth call the
</p>
<p>law of the Kingdom : The authority of that
</p>
<p>paffage of Scripture doth move me more
</p>
<p>than all the arguments of Philofophers. If
</p>
<p>you do not explain this to me, the comments
</p>
<p>of men will not be of fo great account with
</p>
<p>me, but that I may inftantly fall away to the
</p>
<p>adverfaries fide.
</p>
<p>B. You are, as I perceive, in the com-
</p>
<p>mon errouf, and that very grievous, who da
</p>
<p>endeavour to confirm Tyranny by Tyranny :
</p>
<p>For how great the Tyranny of cuftom is ir*
</p>
<p>the minds of men, wherein it hath taken
</p>
<p>deepeft root, and too often we have found

<p>it in this our age, Herodotus, an ancient

</p>
<p>more clear (as we fay) than the very light,
</p>
<p>I need not tarry longer in proving or illu-
</p>
<p>flrating a thing fo perfpicuous. Now as for
</p>
<p>that paflage of Scripture, which from the hi-
</p>
<p>ftory of the Kings you rather fignify than
</p>
<p>explain, beware, I pray you : You think that
</p>
<p>the things which God doth abhor in the life
</p>
<p>of Tyrants, are by him allowed to Kings.
</p>
<p>Now left this be, I bid you firft confider
</p>
<p>what that people fought of the Lord : then
</p>
<p>what caufes of a new petition they had.
</p>
<p>Laftly, what the Lord did anfwer them.
</p>
<p>Firft, they ask a King ; but what a King ? a
</p>
<p>lawful King? Such a one they had. For
</p>
<p>Samu^f was given them by the Lord, whofe
</p>
<p>prerogative it was to fet a King over them. >>
</p>
<p>He had for many years judged them lawful- \
</p>
<p>ly, according to prefcript of God's law ; but
</p>
<p>whilft in his old age his fons did judge, they
</p>
<p>did many things wickedly, and judged con-
</p>
<p>trary to the laws. I fee no reafon why they
</p>
<p>fhould ask the change, or rather amendment
</p>
<p>of the government, or exped the fame from
</p>
<p>the Lord, who not long before had quite
</p>
<p>rooted out the whole family of Helt, almoft
</p>
<p>for the like caufe. What do they then ask?
</p>
<p>A King, fuch as their neighbouring nations
</p>
<p>had, who at home might be a judge to them,
</p>
<p>and abroad a leader of their armies. Now
</p>
<p>in effed fuch were Tyrants : For as the peo-

</p>
<p>There is no mention made, for ought I know,
</p>
<p>by any Hiftorian of any lawful King in Afia.
</p>
<p>Moreover, it doth eafily appear that a Tyrant,
</p>
<p>and not a King, is there defcribed, in regard
</p>
<p>the Lord in Deuteronomy had prefcribcd to
</p>
<p>them a form, not only different from this
</p>
<p>in that place cited by you, but alfo plainly-
</p>
<p>contrary thereto ; according to which form
</p>
<p>Samuel and the other Judges had judged fb
</p>
<p>many years, which whilft they did rejed, the
</p>
<p>Lord complains that he was by them rejeded.
</p>
<p>M. B u T the Lord doth not call him Ty-
</p>
<p>rant, but ever King.
</p>
<p>B. HE calls him indeed King: For it is
</p>
<p>peculiar to the Lord, to ufe the common fpccch
</p>
<p>of the people, as often as he fpcaketh to a
</p>
<p>people. And therefore he maketh ufe of that
</p>
<p>word with the vulgar people ; But left an am-
</p>
<p>biguous ufe thereof might deceive, he doth
</p>
<p>eloquently expound what the ufe of that word
</p>
<p>was amongft neighbouring nations,

</p>
<p>B. THAT you make fo much account of
</p>
<p>the authority in ^Paul, fo as one fentence of
</p>
<p>his hath more weight with you than the wri-
</p>
<p>tings of all Philofophers and Lawyers, I think
</p>
<p>you do well 5 but fee that you consider well
</p>
<p>his judgment, or meaning 5 for you muft riot
</p>
<p>examine the words only, but in what time,
</p>
<p>to whom, and why he wrote. Firft then let
</p>
<p>us fee what *Paul did write. For he writeth
</p>
<p>to Titus, chap. 3. *Put them in mindto.be
</p>
<p>fubjett to principalities and 'power 's, and to be
</p>
<p>ready to every good work. I fuppofe you
</p>
<p>fee what end of obedience and fubjedion
</p>
<p>he appoints. He likewife to Timothy,
</p>
<p>Chap. 2. doth write, that we fhould pray for
</p>
<p>all men, even for Kings, and other Magi-
</p>
<p>Jtrates, that, faith lie, we may live a peace-
</p>
<p>able life in all godlinefs and honefty. And
</p>
<p>here you fee what end of praying he ap-
</p>
<p>points ; namely, not for the King's fafety, but
</p>
<p>the Churches tranquility, from which it will
</p>
<p>be no difficult thing to conceive alfo the form
</p>
<p>of prayer. Now in his Epiftle to the Ro-
</p>
<p>mans, he doth define a King near to a logick

<p>fubtilty ; For, faith he, he is a Minifler to

<p>whom the fword u given by God, for pu-

<p>nifhing the wicked, and for ch Drifting and .

<p>relieving the good. For, faith Chnfofto'm,
</p>
<p>thefc things are not by 'Paul written of a
</p>
<p>Tyrant, but of a true and lawful Magiftratc,

<p>who is the Vice-gercnt of the true God on

</p>
<p>beit we ought to pray for wicked Princes,
</p>
<p>\vc fhould not thence conclude, that their
</p>
<p>vices fhould not be punifhed; nor will it
</p>
<p>more follow that we fhould not punilh the
</p>
<p>rapines of Rob&ers, for whom we are alfo
</p>
<p>commanded to pray. And if we fhould
</p>
<p>obey a good Prince, it will not therefore
</p>
<p>follow that we .Ihould not refift a wicked
</p>
<p>Prince. But if you consider the reafon which
</p>
<p>4id move Taul to write thefe things, look
</p>
<p>that the place or argument make not much a-
</p>
<p>gainft you. For he wrote this to chaftife the
</p>
<p>rafhnefs of fome, who did deny the autho-
</p>
<p>rity to be neceffary for Chrifttans. For fince
</p>
<p>the power of Magiftrates is prdained againfl
</p>
<p>wicked men, that we may all live righte-
</p>
<p>oufly ; and an example of divine Juftice might
</p>
<p>remain amongft men, they affirmed that there
</p>
<p>was no ufe thereof amongft men, who ab-
</p>
<p>hor fo much the contagion of vices, as that
</p>
<p>they are a law to themfelves. *Paul doth
</p>
<p>not therefore fpeak of thofe who bear rule
</p>
<p>as Magiftrates, but of Magiftracy itfelf, that
</p>
<p>is, of the Fundion and office ' of thofe
</p>
<p>who rule $ nor yet of one or other kind
</p>
<p>pf Magiftracy, but of every form of a law-
</p>
<p>ful Magiftracy. Nor doth he debate with
</p>
<p>thofe who think that wicked Magiftrates

<p>fhould be reftrained, but with thofe men who

<p>deny all authority of Magiftrates, who ab-

<p>firm it to be an indignity for thofe that were
</p>
<p>made free by the Son of God, and ruled by
</p>
<p>the Spirit of God, to be under the power of
</p>
<p>any man. That Taul might refute their er-
</p>
<p>ror, he fhewcth, that Magiftracy is a thing
</p>
<p>not only good, but alfo facred, namely an or-
</p>
<p>dinance of God, and for that end inftitute,
</p>
<p>that the afiemblies and incorporations of men
</p>
<p>might be fo continued, that they might ac-
</p>
<p>knowledge God's benefits towards them, and
</p>
<p>might forbear to wrong one another. God
</p>
<p>commanded them to be keepers of his laws
</p>
<p>who were conftitute in dignity. Now if we
</p>
<p>confefs laws to be good ( as indeed they are)
</p>
<p>and the keepers thereof worthy of honour,
</p>
<p>we will be forced to confefs that the office of
</p>
<p>the keepers is a good and profitable thing.
</p>
<p>But Magiftracy is terrible : But to whom ? to

<p>the good, or bad ? To the good it is not a ter-

<p>not fo to you, who are ruled by the Spirit of

<p>treats of the power of Magiftrates, but not

<p>of the wicked Miniftersof that power; nor

<p>will they be at all Magistrates, if you examine
</p>
<p>that kind of Tyrants according to haul's rule.
</p>
<p>But if any will debate that wicked Princes
</p>
<p>arc alfo ordained by God, look that this his
</p>
<p>diicourfe be not captious. For ( as they fay
</p>
<p>in proverb) God may put a hard wedge to

<p>cleave a hard knot, fo doth he fet up a wick-
</p>
<p>ed man for punifhing of wicked men ; but no
</p>
<p>man in his right wits dare affirm, that God is
</p>
<p>therefore the author of cvil,or wick ednefs, even
</p>
<p>as no man is ignorant that he is the author of
</p>
<p>punishing wicked men. A good Magistrate alfo
</p>
<p>for the moft part chufeth a wicked man to be

<p>an hangman for punifhing guilty pcrfons. And
</p>
<p>albeit indeed that a Magistrate doth aSliime fuch

<p>an hangman for that office, yet no impunity is

<p>granted him of all his mifdceds. Nor will

</p>
<p>bafely of the fupream Magiftrate. But how-
</p>
<p>ever they exclaim, certainly this they cannot
</p>
<p>deny, that the hangman's function is a part of
</p>
<p>the publick office, and perhaps of the royal
</p>
<p>office, or at leaft by the teftimony of very
</p>
<p>Kings ; who complain that their Majefty and
</p>
<p>perfon is wronged, as oft as any of their pub-
</p>
<p>lick Miniilers is wronged, or violence done
</p>
<p>to them. Now the punifhment of wicked
</p>
<p>Malefactors, and whatever elfe of that kind,
</p>
<p>doth belong to the King's office. What fay
</p>
<p>you of Majors or Provofts in Towns ? What
</p>
<p>of Generals of Armies? What of Bailies?
</p>
<p>What of Sheriffs ? Doth not ^Paul command

<p>us to be fubjecl: to them ? Doth he hold them

<p>for private perfons ? Now an account ufcth
</p>
<p>to be taken for male-adminiftration of all, not
</p>
<p>only of inferiour Magiftrates, but alfo of fuch
</p>
<p>as are equal to Kings. I would therefore have
</p>
<p>them, who from Paul's words do dream that
</p>
<p>fo great a power is given to Kings, to fhew
</p>
<p>me from him, that Kings only are here to be

<p>underftood by the name of power, and there-

<p>not do this, you muft acknowledge, that what-

<p>ever is enjoined concerning any one perfon

<p>by any fpecial command of God, it doth a-

<p>M. I fhall indeed think upon it. But in

<p>the mean time let us return from whence we

<p>have digreffed. What do you bring from

<p>Scripture, why Tyrants may be be lawfully

</p>
<p>E. F i R s T of all I proffer this, that feeing
</p>
<p>it is exprefly commanded to cut off wicked-
</p>
<p>nefs and wicked men, without any excep-
</p>
<p>tion of rank or degree, and yet in no place

<p>of facred Scripture 'are Tyrants more fpared
</p>
<p>than private perfons. Next, that the defini-
</p>
<p>tion of powers delivered by *Paul doth not
</p>
<p>wholly belong to Tyrants, becaufe they ac-
</p>
<p>commodate not the ftrength of their autho-
</p>
<p>rity for the benefit of the people, but for
</p>
<p>fulfilling their own lufts. Farther, we fhould
</p>
<p>diligently confider how much power 'Paul
</p>
<p>doth grant to Bifhops, whofc fundion he doth
</p>
<p>highly and truly praife, as being fome way
</p>
<p>like unto Kings, as far as the nature of both
</p>
<p>their fun&ions can admit. For Bifhops are
</p>
<p>Phyficians of internal difeafes, as Kings are
</p>
<p>Phyiicians of external diftempers ; and yet he
</p>
<p>would neither of them to be free from, or
</p>
<p>not liable to the jurifdidtion of the other.
</p>
<p>And even as Bifhops are fubjecl: to Kings in
</p>
<p>the exercife of their civil Government, fa

<p>ought Kings to obey the fpiritual admoniti-

<p>doth command wicked men to be cut off 5

<p>punifhment of wicked Kings is approven, I

<p>fhall again ask him, where is the fame re-

<p>of is not taken out of any old example, but

<p>eftabliihed againft new deceits, and that with-

<p>out example. But we have already anfwer-
</p>
<p>ed thole that require examples more than was ,
</p>
<p>needful; now if the Jewijh Kings were not
</p>
<p>punifhed by their Subjects, they make not
</p>
<p>much for our purpofe in hand. For they were
</p>
<p>not at firft created by the people, but were
</p>
<p>by God given them. And therefore very juft-
</p>
<p>ly, he who was the author of that honour,
</p>
<p>was to punifli their mifdeeds. But we de-
</p>
<p>bate, that the people, from whom our Kings
</p>
<p>enjoy what ever privilege they claim, is more
</p>
<p>powerful than their Kings; and that the

<p>whole people have that fame privilege over
</p>
<p>them, which they have over every one in

<p>particular of the whole people. All the

<p>you think here worthy of rcprehcnfion ? Is

<p>it the caufe ? Why is it fought for ? Or is it
</p>
<p>the law itfclf which you reprehended ? for
</p>
<p>the law was fought for rcpreffing the unjuft
</p>
<p>lufts of Kings. Whoever doth condemn
</p>
<p>this, muft likewife condemn all the laws of
</p>
<p>all Nations, for all laws were dcfired for

<p>the very fame caufc. Do you reprehend the
</p>
<p>law itfelf ? Do you think it lawful that Kings
</p>
<p>be exempted of, or not liable to the laws >
</p>
<p>Let us then fee if that be alfo expedient. And
</p>
<p>for proving that it is not expedient for the
</p>
<p>people, there needs not many words. For
</p>
<p>if in the former difcourfc we have rightly

<p>their privilege, and of abrogating it, not for

<p>the fpace of three days, but, according to

<p>our ufual way,, we indift a parliament to

<p>meet within forty days. In the mean time,
</p>
<p>that we may realbn together concern ing the

<p>law, tell me, Doth he feem to reiped the
</p>
<p>good of a madman, who loofeth his bonds ^
</p>
<p>M. NOT at all.
</p>
<p>B. W H A T do you think of him who
</p>
<p>giveth to a man fick of a feaver, fo as he is
</p>
<p>not far from madnels, a drink of cold water,
</p>
<p>though carneftly craving it, do you think he
</p>
<p>defcrveth well of that lick man ?
</p>
<p>M. BUT I fpeak of Kings of a (bund
</p>
<p>mind. I deny that there is any need of me-
</p>
<p>dicine for fuch as are in health, nor of laws
</p>
<p>for Kings of a found mind. But you would
</p>
<p>have all Kings to feem wicked, for you im-
</p>

</p>
<p>B. I do not think that all Kings are wic-
</p>
<p>ked. Nor do I think all the people to be
</p>
<p>wicked, and yet the law in one voice doth
</p>
<p>fpeak to the whole people, Now wicked

<p>men are afraid at that voice ; good people
</p>
<p>do not think it belongs to them. Thus good

<p>Kings have no caufe to be offended at this

<p>284. The due Privilege of

<p>right mind. Even as they who are reftorcd
</p>
<p>to health do render thanks to their Phy/ician,
</p>
<p>whom before they had .hated, becaufe he
</p>
<p>would not grant their defires whilft they were
</p>
<p>fick. But if Kings continue in their mad-
</p>
<p>nefs, whoever doth moft obey them, is to
</p>
<p>be judged their greateft enemy. Of this
</p>
<p>fort are flatterers, who by flatterering their
</p>
<p>vices, do cherifh and increafc" their difeafe,
</p>
<p>and at laft together almoft with Kings are
</p>
<p>utterly ruined.
</p>
<p>M. I cannot indeed deny, but that fuch
</p>
<p>Princes have been and may be rcftrained by
</p>
<p>law-bonds : For there is no monfter more
</p>
<p>violent and more peftifero.us than man, when
</p>
<p>(as it is in the Poets fables) he is once dege-
</p>
<p>nerate into a beaft.
</p>
<p>B. Y o u would much more fay fo, if you
</p>
<p>confidcr how many ways a man becomes a
</p>
<p>beaft, and of how many fevcrai monfters he
</p>
<p>is made. Which thing the old Poets did
</p>
<p>acutely obfcrve and notably cxprefs, when
</p>
<p>they fay that Trometheus in the framing of
</p>
<p>man did give him fbme particle out of every
</p>
<p>living creature. It would be an infinite work
</p>
<p>for me to relate the natures of all one by
</p>
<p>one. But certainly two moft vile monfters
</p>
<p>do evidently appear in man, wrath and luft.
</p>
<p>But what clfc do laws ad or dcftre, but that

<p>And whilft they do not obey reafon, may not

<p>any other from thefe bonds, doth not loofe
</p>
<p>one man; but throws in againft reafon two

<p>monfters exceeding cruel, and armeth them
</p>
<p>for breaking afunder the bars of laws : So
</p>
<p>that Ariflotle feemeth to have rightly and
</p>
<p>truly faid, That he who obeyeth the law,
</p>
<p>doth obey both God and the law ; but he that
</p>
<p>obeyeth the King, doth obey both a man and
</p>
<p>a beaJL
</p>
<p>M. ALBEIT thefe things feem to be faid
</p>
<p>appofitely enough, yet I think we are in a
</p>
<p>miftake two ways. Firft, becaufe the laft
</p>
<p>things we have fpokcn feem not to agree
</p>
<p>well enough with the firft. Next, becaufe,
</p>
<p>as we may well know, we feem not to have
</p>
<p>yet come to the main point of our debate.
</p>
<p>For a little before we were at agreement,
</p>
<p>that the voice of the King and law ought
</p>
<p>to be the fame 5 here again we make him
</p>
<p>fubieft to the laws. Now though we grant
</p>
<p>this to be very true, what have we gained by
</p>
<p>thus conclusion ? For who fhall call to an ac-
</p>
<p>count a King become a Tyrant ? For I fear
</p>
<p>a privilege without ftrength will not be
</p>
<p>powerful enough to renrain a King forgetful
</p>
<p>of his duty, and unwilling to be drawn un-
</p>
<p>to judgment, to anfwer for male-adminiftra-
</p>
<p>tion.

<p>voice of both one and the fame ? I fay of ail

<p>and law. Which of the two hath the au-

<p>thority from the other ? The King from the

<p>law, or the law from the King ?
</p>
<p>M. THE King from the law?
</p>
<p>B. FROM whence colled you that?
</p>
<p>M. BECAUSE the King was not fought

<p>for to rcftrain the law, but the law to re-
</p>
<p>ftrain the King. And from the law he hath
</p>
<p>that, whereby he is a King; for without

<p>the law, he would be a Tyrant.

</p>
<p>ple and the law the fame ?
</p>
<p>M. THE very fame.
</p>
<p>B. WHICH of the two is moft power-
</p>
<p>ful, the people or the law?
</p>
<p>M. I think the whole people.
</p>
<p>B. WHY do you think fo ?
</p>
<p>M. BECAUSE the people is as it were
</p>
<p>the parent of the law, certainly the author
</p>
<p>thereof, they being able to make or abrogate
</p>
<p>it as they pleafe.
</p>
<p>B. SEEING then the law is more pow-
</p>
<p>erful than the King, and the people more
</p>
<p>powerful than the law, we muft lee before
</p>
<p>which we may call. the King to anfwer in
</p>
<p>judgment. Let us alfb difcufs this. Are
</p>
<p>not the things which for fome others fake
</p>
<p>are inftitute, of lefs account than thofe for
</p>
<p>whofe fake they are required or fought ?
</p>
<p>M. I would have that more clearly ex-
</p>
<p>plained.
</p>
<p>B. FOLLOW me thus: Is not a bridle
</p>
<p>made for the horfe's fake?
</p>
<p>M. I T is fo.
</p>
<p>B. A R E not faddlcs, girdings and fpurs,
</p>
<p>made for horfes!
</p>
<p>M. THEY are.
</p>
<p>B. Now if there were no horfe, there
</p>
<p>fhould be no ufe of fuch things.
</p>
<p>M. NONE at all.
</p>
<p>B. A horfe is then better than all thefe.
</p>
<p>M. WHY not?

<p>defired ?
</p>
<p>M. F o R very many ufcs, and firft of all
</p>
<p>for obtaining viftory in war.
</p>
<p>B. WE therefore do eftecm the victory
</p>
<p>to be of more worth than horfcs, arms,
</p>
<p>and other things, which are prepared for
</p>
<p>the ufe of war.
</p>
<p>M. OF more worth indeed it is.
</p>
<p>B. WHAT did men efpecially regard in
</p>
<p>creating a King?
</p>
<p>M. THE peoples good, as I fuppofe.
</p>
<p>B. BUT would there be no need of
</p>
<p>Kings, if there were no focieties of men ?
</p>
<p>M. NONE at all.
</p>
<p>B. THE people then is better than the
</p>
<p>King.
</p>
<p>M. I T muft needs be fo.
</p>
<p>B. I F the people be better, they are alfo
</p>
<p>greater. When a King then is called to
</p>
<p>judgment before a people, the lefler is called
</p>
<p>into judgment before the greater.
</p>
<p>M. BUT when (hall we hope for that
</p>
<p>happinefs, that the whole people agree unto
</p>
<p>that which is right.
</p>
<p>B. THAT indeed is fcarce to be hoped
</p>
<p>for. And to exped it, is certainly needlefs :
</p>
<p>otherwife a law could neither be made, nor
</p>
<p>a Magiftrate created. For neither is almoft
</p>
<p>any law alike to all, nor is there almoft any

</p>
<p>ftrcd, that the law be ufeful for the greateft

<p>if the greateft part of the people may enjoyn

<p>what doth hinder, but that they alib may

<p>Or if the Tribunes of the people of Rome >

<p>and the Lacedemonian Efhori were fought to

<p>modify the power of Magiftracy, fhould it

<p>either upon the like or different account,
</p>
<p>did forclec their own good in fupprcffing

<p>the bitterncfs of Tyranny ?
</p>
<p>M. Now I feem almoft to perceive what
</p>
<p>a people can do : But it is a matter of dif-
</p>
<p>ficulty to judge what they will do, or ap-

<p>point to be done. For the greatcft part al-

<p>moft doth require old and ufual cuftoms,

<p>be admired, feeing there is fo great an in-

<p>conftancy in meat, apparel, buildings, and

<p>in all houfhold 'furniture.

<p>B. Do not think that tHefe things are

<p>fpoken by me, that I would have any new

<p>thing in this kind to be done, but that I

<p>might lhew you it hath been of old, that a

</p>
<p>tended for the Kingdom to have appealed

<p>to Arbiters?
</p>
<p>M. I have indeed heard it to have been

<p>fomctimes done amongft the ^Perjians.
</p>
<p>B. A N D our writers affirm, that the fame

<p>prevail, as if a man fhould fprcad nets in

<p>U 2 the
</p>
<p>292 The due Privilege of
</p>
<p>the avarice of the vulgar is infatiable, as a
</p>
<p>fire is the more vehemently kindled by ad-
</p>
<p>ding fewel thereto : But what is by force ta-
</p>
<p>ken away from many, doth rather increafe
</p>
<p>the hunger of fomc few, than fatiate their
</p>
<p>luft. And further, the fidelity of fuch men
</p>
<p>for the moft part is unftable. As faith the
</p>
<p>Poet, Fidelity doth ft and and fall with for-
</p>
<p>tune. But if they would alfo continue firm
</p>
<p>in their judgment, they fhouid not be ac-
</p>
<p>counted in the number of good fubjeds, for
</p>
<p>they are the violators, or rather betrayers of
</p>
<p>humane fociety : Which vice, if not fuffe-
</p>
<p>rable in a King, is far lefs tolerable in a pri-
</p>
<p>vate perfon. Who then are to be accounted
</p>
<p>the right fubjeds ? They who give obedience
</p>
<p>to the laws, maintain and defend humane
</p>
<p>fociety, who rather undergo all pains and
</p>
<p>labours, and all hazards for common fafety,
</p>
<p>than fpend their time fluggifhly in idlenefs,
</p>
<p>void of all honefly ? Who fet before their

<p>eyes, not their prefent enjoyments, but the

<p>remembrance of eternity. But if there be

<p>any whom fear and felf-intereft recall from

<p>raife up dejeded minds : And thofe who

<p>dare not be authors or leaders, will not de-

<p>cline to become aflbciates. If therefore fub-

</p>
<p>liberty, honefty and fafety. But if the whole
</p>
<p>common people diiTent, this fays nothing to
</p>
<p>our prefent debate 5 for we demand not
</p>
<p>what is to be done, but what may lawfully
</p>
<p>be done. But now let us come to the or-
</p>
<p>dinary judicial fentences.
</p>
<p>M. THAT I juft now look for.
</p>
<p>B. IF any private man contend that his
</p>
<p>inheritance, or fome part of his land is un-
</p>
<p>juftly detained by the King,what do you think
</p>
<p>mould this private man do ? mall he pafs from
</p>
<p>his land, becaufe he cannot fet a judge over
</p>
<p>the King?
</p>
<p>M. NOT at all, but he may command
</p>
<p>not the King, but his proxy to compear in
</p>
<p>judgment.
</p>
<p>B. Now 'fee what ftrength that refuge
</p>
<p>hath whereof you make ufe. For it is all one
</p>
<p>to me, whether the King compear, or his
</p>
<p>proxy, or advocate, for both ways, the litis-
</p>
<p>conteftation will redound to the King's lofs j
</p>
<p>the damage or gain will redound to him, not
</p>
<p>to his advocate, by the event of the fentence.
</p>
<p>In end he is found guilty, that is, he whofe
</p>
<p>caufe is agitate. Now I would have you con-
</p>
<p>fider not only how abfurd it is, but alfo un-
</p>
<p>juft to pafs fentence againft a King for a pet-
</p>
<p>ty inheritance for lights in a houfe, or for eafe
</p>
<p>droppings thereof, and no fentence to be pad
</p>
<p>for parricide, wicthcraft, or treafon. To

<p>294 ^ e ^ ue Privilege of
</p>
<p>punity to be permitted in the greateft crimes.
</p>
<p>So that that old proverb feems plainly true,
</p>
<p>Laws are very like fpiders webs, which hold
</p>
<p>- flies faft, but let bigger beads pafs thro',
</p>
<p>nor is that complaint and indignation of
</p>
<p>fome juft, who fay that it is neither honeft
</p>
<p>npr equitable, that judgment ihould pals a-
</p>
<p>gainft a King, by a man of an inferiour rank,
</p>
<p>feeing they fee it received and admitted in
</p>
<p>debate about money or land ; and the great-
</p>
<p>eft Peers next to the King for the moft part
</p>
<p>compear before the Judges, who arc inferi-
</p>
<p>our to them in riches, nobility, and valour.
</p>
<p>And not much above the vulgar rank i and
</p>
<p>far more below the guilty, than the greateft
</p>
<p>Peers arc below Kings. Nor yet for all this
</p>
<p>do theie noble men, or Peers think it any de-
</p>
<p>rogation, to their dignity. Now if we fhall
</p>
<p>once admit this, that no man can be filled be-
</p>
<p>fore a Judge, unlefs the judge be every way
</p>
<p>fuperiour^tothe pcrfon arreigncd, the inferi-
</p>
<p>our rank muft attend and wait on until the
</p>
<p>King cither pleafe, or be at leifurc, to cog-
</p>
<p>nofce' concerning the guilty Noble man ; but
</p>
<p>what if their complaint be not only unjuft,

<p>but alfo falfe ? For no man coming before a

<p>Judge "doth come before an inferiour perfon,

<p>cfpecially feeing fo great an honour is by

<p>necks of Emperours, being called to anfwcr

<p>Majefty of Popes to be fo far above them, as
</p>
<p>that it doth over-fhadow them all with the top
</p>
<p>of its celfitude, I know not how they think

<p>well bcfeeming the Majefly of a King to

<p>confefs he is a Prince tied to the Laws. And

<p>we declare that it is more to fubmit a principa-

</p>
<p>what we now declare by this oui: cdift, we

<p>will not iuffcr to be infringed. Thcfe things

<p>29 8 The due Privilege of
</p>
<p>laws is ftill the fame, whether the King, a
</p>
<p>Judge, or an Herauld proclaim it.
</p>
<p>M. I T is fo indeed.
</p>
<p>B. THE law then being once eftablifhed,
</p>
<p>is firft the voice of the King, and then of
</p>
<p>others.
</p>
<p>M. IT is fo.
</p>
<p>B. WHILST then the King is condem-
</p>
<p>ned by a judge, he fccms to be condemned
</p>
<p>by the Jaw.
</p>
<p>M. THAT is very clear.
</p>
<p>B. IF by the law, then he is condemned
</p>
<p>by his own voice, as feems, no lefs than if it
</p>
<p>were written with his own hand.
</p>
<p>B. WHY then do we fo much weary our
</p>
<p>icivcs concerning a judge, feeing we have the
</p>
<p>King's own confcflidn, that is to fay, ' the
</p>
<p>law ? Let us alfo'confidcr this, which is but
</p>
<p>prcfcntly come into my mind. When a.
</p>
<p>Kim; in what caufc foever doth fit in judg-
</p>
<p>ment as a judge, fhould he not lay afide the
</p>
<p>pcrfoh of all others, and to have no rcfpeft
</p>
<p>to brother, kiufmaii, friend or foe, but re-
</p>
<p>tain only the pcrfon of a judge ?
</p>
<p>M. -H E ought fo to do.
</p>
<p>B. OUGHT he not to remember that
</p>
<p>pcrfon only, whofe proper act it is he is a-
</p>
<p>bout ?
</p>
<p>M. I would have you tell me that more
</p>
<p>clearly.

<p>B. To others alfo after this manner from

<p>the adions they are about, names may be

<p>rightly given.

<p>M. THEY may.

<p>B. WHEN a King then is to pafs a fcn-

</p>
<p>Seeing God will have no refpecl to be had to

</p>
<p>B. I F then any man, who is a painter, or
</p>
<p>a Grammarian, debate before a judge concern-
</p>
<p>ing the art of painting againft a painter, he is
</p>
<p>not a Grammarian, for the icience of Gram-

<p>if the debate be concerning Grammar;

</p>
<p>B. A judge then in judgment muft acknow-

<p>or guilt, whereof the advcrfary or plaintiff

<p>cide, hath he the name of a King, and what-
</p>
<p>ever doth belong to a judge ?
</p>
<p>M. NOTHING at all, but only of a par-

<p>is fo great force in an honeft deed, that the

<p>but from their own defert towards others.

<p>B. You do then judge that to be true,
</p>
<p>that Tyrants are to be reckoned in the num-
</p>
<p>ber of the moft cruel brute beafts ; and that
</p>
<p>tyrannical violence is more unnatural than

<p>M. INDEED when I do ponder the

<p>defend the doer and author of their liberty

<p>an honeft pretext of peace will veil their

<p>own lazinefs, or rather calumniate the ver-

</p>
<p>courfe with openly lewd and flagitious men.
</p>
<p>If this were obfervcd amongft Chriftians,
</p>
<p>fuch lewd men, unlefs they did repent,
</p>
<p>might pcrifh by hunger, cold and nakcdncfs.
</p>
<p>M. A grievous fentence indeed that is.
</p>
<p>But I do not know if a people, that allow
</p>
<p>fo much liberty every way to their Rulers,
</p>
<p>will believe that Kings fliould be pumfhed
</p>
<p>after this manner.
</p>
<p>B. SURELY the ancient Ecclcfiaftick
</p>
<p>writers without exception did thus understand
</p>
<p>that fentence of Paul. For Ambroft did
</p>
<p>hold out of the Affembly of the Chriftians
</p>
<p>The o do fins the Emperour, and Thtodojms
</p>
<p>obeyed the faid Bifhop : And, for what
</p>
<p>I know, antiquity doth more highly extol
</p>
<p>the deed of no other fo much, nor is
</p>
<p>the modefty of any other Emperour more
</p>
<p>commended. But to our purpofe : What
</p>
<p>difference is there betwixt the exclusion out
</p>
<p>of chriitian fellowfhip, and the interdiction
</p>
<p>from fire and water? This lair is a moft
</p>
<p>grievous fentence impofcd by Rulers againft
</p>
<p>fuch as refufe to obey their commands 5 and
</p>
<p>the former is a fentence of churchmen.
</p>
<p>Now the pnnifhmcnt of the contempt of
</p>
<p>both authorities is death > but the fecular.
</p>
<p>Judge denounccth the death of the body,
</p>
<p>the Ecclefiallick judge denounccth the dc-

<p>ilrtiction of the whole man. Therefore the

<p>Church will not account him worthy of

<p>lowfhip of Chriftians, while he is alive 5 and

<p>of the caufe, I think I have fpoken abun-
</p>
<p>dantly ; if therewith any foreigners be dif-
</p>
<p>pleafed, I deiire they would confider how
</p>
<p>unjuftly they deal with us. For whilft there
</p>
<p>be many Nations both great and wealthy in
</p>
<p>Europe? having all their own peculiar laws,
</p>
<p>they deal arrogantly who would prefcribe to
</p>
<p>all that model and form of Government
</p>
<p>which they themfelves enjoy. The Helve-
</p>
<p>tians Government is a Commonwealth.
</p>
<p>Germany ufeth the name or title of Empire,
</p>
<p>as a lawful Government. Some Cities in
</p>
<p>Germany (as I am informed) are under the
</p>
<p>rule of Princes. The Venetians have a
</p>
<p>Seignory tempered of thefe. Mufcovia hath
</p>
<p>a very Tyranny inftead of Government. We
</p>
<p>have indeed but a little Kingdom, but we
</p>
<p>have enjoy 'd it thefe two thoufand years free
</p>
<p>of the Empire of foreign Nations. We did
</p>
<p>create at firit lawful Kings ; we did impofe
</p>
<p>upon ourfelvcs and them equal and juft laws ;
</p>
<p>the long Continuance of time doth mew
</p>
<p>they were ufeful : For more by the obferva-
</p>
<p>tion thereof, than by force of arms, hath
</p>
<p>this Kingdom ftood intire hitherto. Now 1
</p>
<p>what iniquity is this, that we fhould defire

<p>either to abrogate or ncgleft the laws, the

<p>good whereof we have found by experience

<p>be more ufeful for keeping peace with our

<p>further, what more hurtful can there be to

<p>any Commonwealth, than bad laws amongft

<p>no Nation hath altogether the fame laws

<p>ditious than we. I deny that any Nation
</p>
<p>hath ever been more moderate in (editions

<p>for laws, and right of Government, and ad-

<p>love to our own country, and deftrc to

<p>maintain our laws. How often in our time

<p>have great armies flood in oppoiition to one

<p>withdrawn from one another, not only

<p>without wound, but without any harm, yea

<p>without fo much as a reproach ? How often
