<p>IT is not eafy to difcover the motive
</p>
<p>which could have led to the publication of

<p>the following work ; a work which, when

<p>we confider the fituation of the Author,
</p>
<p>whether with a view to the ambitious prof-
</p>
<p>pefts which he may be fuppofed ftill to
</p>
<p>entertain, or to that regard for character
</p>
<p>which is never wholly abandoned by the
</p>
<p>moft profligate of mankind, muft appear

<p>equally prejudicial to his interefts and to

</p>
<p>lumnies (for fuch they appear to be) alledged
</p>
<p>againft him by the Directorial Reporter,
</p>
<p>Bailleul, the Author has contrived to give
</p>
<p>a general view of his political Character and
</p>
<p>Opinions, and an Apology (or, more pro-
</p>
<p>perly fpeaking, a Juftification, for fuch the
</p>
<p>Author feems to confider it) of his Prin-
</p>
<p>ciples and Conduct during the Revolution.
</p>
<p>And this Apology, including an arrogant
</p>
<p>amimption of merit, from the murder of
</p>
<p>his fovereign, and confining his whole ex-
</p>
<p>culpation of the innumerable murders com-
</p>
<p>mitted in his own name and under his own

<p>authority to a flight afiertion of a difappro-
</p>

<p>logy, devoting its Author to infamy (in the

<p>opinion of all thofe, by whom his conduct
</p>
<p>may be eflimated according to the ancient and
</p>
<p>immutable principles of morality), is at the

<p>Directors, as they are perfonally, and viru-
</p>
<p>lentlyy and (what is ftill more unpardonable)
</p>
<p>juftly denounced to the world as the enemies

<p>of peace and the oppreflors of mankind j

</p>
<p>an artful infmuation of falfehood ; to recol-
</p>
<p>lect and record the tranfaclions of a merito-
</p>
<p>rious and honourable life was in itfelf no
</p>
<p>unpleafmg duty ; and they were confcious
</p>
<p>that the purpofes for which alone they ex-
</p>
<p>jfted would extend themfelves, and be per-
</p>
<p>petuated with the influence of their example.
</p>
<p>But there are other writers of a very diffe-
</p>
<p>rent character, men whofe lives have been
</p>
<p>pernicious or ufelefs to fociety; who have,
</p>
<p>never thelefs, conceived it important that pof-

<p>terity fhould be acquainted with their princi-
</p>
<p>ples, fuch as they were, and with the courfe
</p>
<p>of their tranfaclions and intrigues. This
</p>
<p>rage for perpetuating the portraitures of men-
</p>
<p>tal deformity has been at all times remarka-
</p>
<p>.bly prevalent in France j and the immenfe

</p>
<p>which embitters the exile or feceflion of a

<p>whom ambition has raifed to notice for an

<p>iniiant and then replunged in their ori-

<p>a little farther than was neceffary, or indeed

</p>
<p>The Apology offered by his principal, the

<p>it be a ftifficient apology, or any thing

<p>inexplicable chain of obligation, it had
</p>
<p>[ vii ]
</p>
<p>originally his duty to become a member of
</p>
<p>the Committee of Public Safety ; and that,
</p>
<p>once appointed to that facred trail, he was
</p>
<p>bound to continue his fervices, and to retain
</p>
<p>life at the expence of guilt and infamy.

<p>He certainly would have done better to have

<p>confined himfelf to the fingle thefis which

<p>forms the profeffed fubjecl: of his work,
</p>
<p>namely, to prove that BAILLEUL'S accufation
</p>
<p>of Royalifm, and LEPAUX'S imputations of
</p>
<p>Chriftianity, are unfounded ; and that the
</p>
<p>Author is, in fa6l, as found an Atheifl and
</p>
<p>as good a Regicide as heart could wifh or

<p>AT length I have received a copy of the Report

<p>of Bailleul on the Confpiracy of Fru&idor, and
</p>
<p>have eagerly examined whether any thing it con-
</p>
<p>tained concerned me perfonally. I there found,
</p>
<p>that the committee had honoured me with par-
</p>
<p>ticular attention, and that it had recorded my
</p>
<p>fuppofed delinquencies in about twelve lines of
</p>
<p>text, and forty-five of notes.
</p>
<p>I know not whether, in the remainder of the

<p>I oppofed the removal of Willot until fur-
</p>
<p>ther examinations were made. The other mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the Directory did the fame. This is evi-
</p>
<p>dent ; fince, if they had thought with Barras,
</p>
<p>they would have been a majority, and Willot
</p>
<p>would have been difmifTed. Thefe are th'e
</p>
<p>wretches who accufc me now of having oppofed

<p>Willot's difmiffal!

<p>In the departments of the South was a

<p>of the Direftory. It was agreed to refer the

</p>
<p>bufmefs to him ; he was ordered immediately
</p>
<p>to repair to Marfeilles, and tranfmit an exaft
</p>
<p>and pofitive account of the conduct of Willot.

<p>Cadet wrote that Willot conduced himfelf very

<p>well, that he difplayed much energy and impar-

<p>In the mean while complaints were made

<p>Toulon. The Directory ordered Cadet to pro-
</p>
<p>ceed to Toulon, and fend them an account of

<p>-the conduct of Moynat. Cadet returned for
</p>
<p>anfwer, that Moynat was unfit for the command,

<p>and that he leaned to ariftocracy. I immediate-

<p>ly propofed the removal of Moynat, and taking

<p>was no longer employed, but came to Paris,

<p>he boafted of having been the original propofo

<p>it was I alone that was to bear the blame far

<p>Some, it is true, there were, who were defirous
</p>
<p>of ruining Bonaparte. I allude to the famoui
</p>
<p>triumvirate, who were continually trembling left
</p>
<p>they mould be deprived of their authority and
</p>
<p>power. The afcendency which that General
</p>
<p>had acquired, through his innumerable vi&o-
</p>
<p>ries, began to goad and torment them. While
</p>
<p>they attempted to ruin Bonaparte, I was alfo
</p>
<p>to be involved in the confequences ; and thus the
</p>
<p>triumvirate would get rid of two of their ene-
</p>
<p>mies at once. Then it was evident that I was
</p>
<p>the fecret rival of the Hero of Italy, whofe fall

<p>I had prepared ! My fentence would have been

<p>fpeedily pronounced ; and they would have then

<p>performed the obfequies of Bonaparte* as mag-
</p>
<p>nificently as they did thofe of General Hoche.
</p>
<p>But it will be anfwered, that I ought in my

<p>turn to prove my affertions. This would be per-

<p>fe&ly eafy, if, like Bailleul, I had the official

<p>mediately, he would have attended this meeting,

<p>in order to accelerate its objer. But on the
</p>
<p>contrary, he abfented himfelf, and Reubel flayed
</p>
<p>at home to meditate new expedients and eva-
</p>
<p>fions for the enfuing day. The Treaty, how-
</p>
<p>ever, was drawn up in a fingle evening, and

<p>the next day, notwkhilanding the accuftomed

<p>tion of affairs rendered indifpenfably neceflary,
</p>
<p>was an affront never to be forgiven by that de-

<p>ceitful and vindictive ftatefman.
</p>
<p>Although the collective force of the enemies
</p>
<p>oppofed to Bonaparte was thus confiderably di-

<p>miniflied, and although he had now his flanks
</p>
<p>and his rear free from annoyance, yet he had
</p>
<p>not fufficient forces to procure him any decifive
</p>
<p>advantages over the Emperor. He demanded a

<p>I think, I have difcovered a {lender clue that

<p>leads to it. Here it is.
</p>
<p>I recommended giving to the Duke of Parma
</p>
<p>fome portions of the Papal territories, (notwith-
</p>
<p>Handing my affection for his holinefs), and part
</p>
<p>of thofe of Modena in exchange for Louifiana and
</p>
<p>Florida, which the King of Spain was to have
</p>
<p>ceded to us for the fake of procuring a more con-
</p>
<p>fiderable eftabliftiment for the Infant. In this I
</p>
<p>perceived two advantages; 1ft, The advantage,
</p>
<p>not of creating a new republic in Europe, but,
</p>
<p>on the contrary, of republicanism^ a fine exten->
</p>
<p>Jive' tract of country in America, which would

<p>have given us fo great an influence over the United '

</p>
<p>Add to this, it would have been a farther means
</p>
<p>of fecuring the continuance of peace, and
</p>
<p>of the alliance of the French Republic with
</p>
<p>Spain : for then, Spain would have felt the want

<p>of us to affift her in oppofmg the Emperor in

<p>Italy ; and had (lie been inclined to declare war,

<p>flic would have been expofed to be attacked by

<p>bcft pledge we could receive of a permanent

<p>alliance with Spain. But the penetrating eye of

<p>true object was to revive the kingdom of Lom-

<p>bardyj and the dread of this imaginary kingdom
</p>
<p>prevented them from aggrandizing the Republic

<p>with an immenfe territory now ufelefs and even

<p>prejudicial to Spain, and from holding out their

<p>firous, however, that he Ihould explicitly 'declare

<p>fancied they had only fent for Augereau merely
</p>

</p>
<p>told me at the time of the firft journey of that-
</p>
<p>General, when he had brought fixty ftandards
</p>
<p>that were taken from the enemy by the Army
</p>
<p>of Italy, ** He has muck the appearance of a
</p>
<p>violent partisan" Said Reubel : " What a fero-

<p>cious mifcreant ! " To the firft part of his re-

<p>mark I readily aflented, for his external appear-
</p>
<p>ance was that of a Marius, and his oftentation
</p>
<p>was hardly to be reconciled with republican
</p>
<p>{implicity or undeviating probity. But it may
</p>
<p>be prcfumed that he rather acled as an ambaf-
</p>
<p>fador with the Directory, than as one of the
</p>
<p>Generals of the Army of Italy.
</p>
<p>The parade he employed on this occafion would
</p>
<p>not have appeared blame-worthy, had he not, on
</p>
<p>the one hand, carried it to ridiculous lengths,
</p>
<p>and on the other, had not his ambitious views
</p>
<p>been too flagrantly apparent. The gold and the

<p>diamonds with which he was covered refembled

<p>the fpoils of the vanquiihed, and the rings that

<p>would have been far better without the fmalleft

<p>was ftipulated for that of Venice, and Venice
</p>
<p>is furely a place of more importance than

<p>Mantua. Bonaparte had written, that Man-

<p>the fecurity of the Cifalpine Republic, by

<p>Pizzighitone, and that the latter had feveral

</p>
<p>might adopt, to give up Venice in its Head !
</p>
<p>and, to that effect, I had even prepared a letter
</p>
<p>to Bonaparte ; but they cried out, that it would
</p>
<p>be better to give up Mantua than Venice.
</p>
<p>Here they were right, and I had only propofed
</p>
<p>to give up the latter becaufe I perceived they
</p>
<p>Were obftinately refolved to keep the former 5
</p>
<p>yet it was Venice they ultimately gave up.

<p>The letter I had written was thrown into the

</p>
<p>had formed the fame idea with myfelf, and the

<p>next day or the day after we received difpatches

<p>from him propofmg to fubftitute Venice for
</p>
<p>Mantua in the Preliminaries of Leoben, adding,
</p>
<p>that with this condition peace would be

<p>fpeedily concluded. They had rejected this pro-
</p>
<p>pofal when it came from me, and they equally
</p>
<p>rejected it from Bonaparte. In a word, their

<p>wifli was to keep both Mantua and Venice,

<p>in this point, to refume their arms immediately ;

<p>I had had the good fortune at the committee,
</p>
<p>to contribute to the extrication of the Republic
</p>
<p>from its danger by repelling its enemies ; and
</p>
<p>the only recompence I obtained was a horrid
</p>
<p>perfecution. When in the Directory, I con-
</p>
<p>tributed to extricate it from new dangers,
</p>
<p>wherein thefe fame villains, then acting as
</p>
<p>factious reactionaries, had plunged it ; and the
</p>
<p>recompence was my Fructidorian profoription.
</p>
<p>I well knew that Republics were ungrateful,
</p>
<p>but I did not yet know that the individuals
</p>
<p>who call themfelves republicans were guilty
</p>
<p>of fuch bafe ingratitude as I have fmce ex-
</p>
<p>perienced.

<p>If any one deferved to be exiled for having

<p>given rife to reaction, certainly that reward is

<p>Reubel very often exprellly declared this pro-

<p>tive to almoft every member of the legislative

<p>ing them, no matter from what quarter, which

<p>he carefully laid by and arranged in the pigeon-

<p>whereas, on the contrary, it was I who (though

<p>much as poflible, by a letter which I wrote m

<p>the name of the Directory, expreffive of their

<p>regret at lofing an officer of fuch diftinguUhed

</p>
<p>not have fuffered this letter to be fent to him,

<p>had they read it j but they figned it conjidjen-

<p>tially. In fhort, with regard to every man of

<p>ever, I never heard any language fo conform-

</p>
<p>yet no man is in general fo well able to com-

<p>fpends twenty-five louis a-day at the Mount

<p>the truth quite uncertain, that he might be able

<p>afterwards to affert or deny it as might bed

<p>fuit his purpofe. The fafct is, that neither he,
</p>
<p>Reubel, nor Reveillere, made their appearance.
</p>
<p>Afterwards, however, they purfued this affair
</p>
<p>with much more warmth than I, who have al-
</p>
<p>ways been of opinion that no influence ought

<p>to be exercifed over the tribunals, when taking

<p>adopt, of letting other men al in all cafes of

<p>danger, aud then attributing the fuccefs to
</p>
<p>themfelves, or throwing the blame on others.
</p>
<p>When feveral perfons came, #n the following
</p>
<p>day, to give us an account of what they had
</p>
<p>witneffed of them, one told us that Tallien, and
</p>
<p>feveral others of the Orleans fa6tion, had been
</p>
<p>waiting on the banks of the river to fee the re-
</p>
<p>mit of the attack of the Camp of Crenelle, and
</p>
<p>that as foon as they learnt that it had failed,
</p>
<p>they difperfed and took flight. Barras, who
</p>
<p>lived in habits of intimacy with Tallien, thought
</p>
<p>it might be better for him to feparate their ap-
</p>
<p>parent interefts, and therefore began to abufe

<p>and calumniate his friend. He faid, " that if

<p>there were five hundred conspiracies, Tallien

<p>would be concerned in them all.'

<p>the prominent feature of his duties. . And of

<p>what materials muft that man be compofed, the

<p>not be filled by receiving fuch a high and im-

<p>of that man's guilt, who receives this truft

</p>
<p>Neverthelefs, the triumvirs, inftead of preferving

<p>the people from abfolute power, have clothed

<p>themfelves with it. They have difcovered that

<p>the office of dictator is fuperipr to that of di-

<p>threats of the law. In ihort, it has ever been
</p>
<p>[ 197 ]
</p>
<p>my opinion, that prejudice fliould be fuffered to
</p>
<p>difperfe infenfibly before the light of reafon, rather
</p>
<p>than be extirpated by the violence of power.
</p>
<p>I have certainly committed many errors in pur-
</p>
<p>fuing a career to which I had not been originally
</p>
<p>deftined ; but I never deferted the principles
</p>
<p>which formed a compafs to guide me through
</p>
<p>the revolutionary tempefts. If I availed myfelf
</p>
<p>of an univerfal enthufiafm to pufh on the war
</p>
<p>with an unexampled vigour, it was rather to put an
</p>
<p>end to the critical ftate in which that enthufiafm
</p>
<p>had placed the nation. I had conceived the
</p>
<p>defign of writing the hiftory of this hallowed war,
</p>
<p>which has fixed the bafis of the great Republic
</p>
<p>on its own immortal trophies j and to coniign,
</p>
<p>in its annals, the innumerable ats of its heroes,
</p>
<p>for the glory and inftrution of their pofterity.
</p>
<p>With this view I eftabliflied the office, called the
</p>
<p>Typographical and Hiftorical Cabinet, where I
</p>
<p>had caufed a very large quantity of materials to
</p>
<p>be colle&ed ; and which others may be better

<p>clean hands and a pure heart,
