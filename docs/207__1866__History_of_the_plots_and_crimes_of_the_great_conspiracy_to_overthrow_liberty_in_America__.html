</p>
<p>It is the object of the author to give, in a small compass, a
</p>
<p>complete history of tbe political crimes originating with African
</p>
<p>Slavery, and perpetrated by its friends, during the last century, in
</p>
<p>America. We think it necessary, for the good of future generations, to
</p>
<p>show bow these men resorted to the most atrocious means to
</p>
<p>defeat the nation's will, and control the Government; and all
</p>
<p>these failing, how they rose in open rebellion, determined to
</p>
<p>destroy the power they could no longer control. We deem it
</p>
<p>useless to speak here of the assassination of three of our most
</p>
<p>illustrious Presidents, all of whom were swept aside like cobwebs
</p>
<p>when they stood in the way of tbe conspirator's unholy designs.
</p>
<p>Thus all the chief magistrates elected, since the foundation of
</p>
<p>the Government, in opposition to the slave interests, in some form
</p>
<p>or other, became victims of assassination.
</p>
<p>We have given the history of these foul deeds in detail ;
</p>
<p>and the evidence furnished will enable the reader to judge under-
</p>
<p>standingly, and correctly. We have thought proper to throw
</p>
<p>out a few hints about State Sovereignty under the head of Origin
</p>
<p>and History of the American Union, and Historical Sketches

</p>
<p>IV PREFACE^
</p>
<p>all important events and battles from the outbreak of the rebel
</p>
<p>lion to its overthrow, showing that the sword, and the sword alone,
</p>
<p>conquered peace. Slavery, the cause of our strife, must be wiped
</p>
<p>out ; as the object'; of the rebellion was to extend and perpetuate
</p>
<p>it; and retain the black man in hopeless bondage. The rebellion
</p>
<p>failed ; and all its hopes and expectations must perish with its fall.
</p>
<p>The slaves, by the logic of events, should now become as free
</p>
<p>as their masters. But as the latter sought to destroy the Federal
</p>
<p>Government when they ceased to control it, so they now seek by
</p>
<p>various devices to bring about a condition of things calculated to
</p>
<p>produce a war of races. They want the civilized world to justify
</p>
<p>them in their mischievous designs in defying the General Gov
</p>
<p>ernment behind their old fortification,' the rights of the States,
</p>
<p>where they are now enacting unequal laws, determined to retain
</p>
<p>all the substance, while they acknowledge that the form of slavery
</p>
<p>has become extinct.
</p>
<p>They design to use the black as an instrument to curtail the
</p>
<p>liberty of the white. But they will learn that there is no safety
</p>
<p>for their own freedom, except through justice and equal laws to
</p>
<p>the former.

<p>Wilmington Its Capture 248
</p>
<p>MR. LINCOLN'S FAVORITE POEM;
</p>
<p>This was written by William Knox, a young Scotchman, a contemporary of
</p>
<p>Walter Scott, who died quite young, leaving this production as a monument to his
</p>
<p>youthful and gifted mind. His remarks on the Declaration of Independence, and
</p>
<p>fondness for this poem, display the goodness of Mr. Lincoln's heart.
</p>
<p>Oh ! why should the spirit of mortal be proud 1 
</p>
<p>Like a swift-fleeting meteor, a fast-flying cloud,
</p>
<p>A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,
</p>
<p>He passeth from life to his rest in the grave.
</p>
<p>The leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade,
</p>
<p>Be scattered around, and together be laid ;
</p>
<p>And the young and the old, and the low and the high,
</p>
<p>Shall moulder to dust, and together shall lie.
</p>
<p>The infant a mother attended and loved ;
</p>
<p>The mother, that infant's affection who proved
</p>
<p>The husband, that mother and infant who blest,
</p>
<p>Each, all, are away to their dwelling of rest.
</p>
<p>[The maid on whose cheek, on whose brow, in whose eye,
</p>
<p>Shone beauty and pleasure  her triumphs are by ;
</p>
<p>And the memory of those who loved her and praised,
</p>
<p>Are alike from the minds of the living erased."]
</p>
<p>The hand of the king, that the sceptre hath borne,
</p>
<p>The brow of the priest, that the mitre hath worn,
</p>
<p>The eye of the sage, and the heart of the brave,
</p>
<p>Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave.
</p>
<p>The peasant, whose lot was to sow and to reap,
</p>
<p>The herdsman, who climbed with his goats up the steep,
</p>
<p>The beggar, who wandered in search of his bread,
</p>
<p>Have faded away like the grass that we tread.
</p>
<p>[The saint, who enjoyed the communion of heaven,
</p>
<p>The sinner, who dared to remain unforgiven,
</p>
<p>The wise and the foolish, the guilty and just,
</p>
<p>Have quietly mingled their bones in the dust.]
</p>
<p>So the multitude goes  like the flower or the weed,
</p>
<p>That withers away to let others succeed ;
</p>
<p>So the multitudes come  even those we behold,

<p>To repeat every tale that has often been told :
</p>
<p>For we are the same our fathers have been ;
</p>
<p>We see the same sights our fathers have seen ;
</p>
<p>We drink the same stream, we view the same sun,
</p>
<p>And run the same course our fathers have run.
</p>
<p>The thoughts we are thinking, our fathers would think ;
</p>
<p>From the death we are shrinking, our fathers would shrink I
</p>
<p>To the life we are clinging, they also would cling 
</p>
<p>But it speeds from us all like a bird on the wing.
</p>
<p>They loved  but the story we can not unfold ;
</p>
<p>They scorned  but the heart of the haughty is cold ;
</p>
<p>They grieved  but no wail from their slumber will come ;
</p>
<p>They joyed  but the tongue of their gladness is dumb.
</p>
<p>They died  ay, they died  we things that are now,
</p>
<p>That walk on the turf that lies over their brow,
</p>
<p>And make in their dwelling a transient abode.
</p>
<p>Meet the things that they met on their pilgrimage road.
</p>
<p>Tea! hope and despondency, pleasure and pain
</p>
<p>Are mingled together in sunshine and rain ;
</p>
<p>And the smile and the tear, the song and the dirge,
</p>
<p>Still follow each other, like surge upon surge.
</p>
<p>Tis the wink of an eye,  'tis the draught of a breath ;
</p>
<p>From the blossom of health to the paleness of death,
</p>
<p>From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud :

<p>Oh! why should the spirit of mortal be proud?
</p>
<p>THE FATHEES
</p>
<p>THE EEVOLUTION.
</p>
<p>THEIR DEVOTION TO FREEDOM.
</p>
<p> On the fifteenth day of May, 1776, the birds had returned
</p>
<p>with the season, and were making forest and grove resound
</p>
<p>with their songs. The beautiful spring flowers had matured
</p>
<p>in all their loveliness, and climbing on their tiny leaves the
</p>
<p>Honey Bee sweetly sung out that winter was gone.
</p>
<p>Although nature was smiling, the Colonies were sad. The
</p>
<p>tyranny of England had kindled a feeling of revenge in their
</p>
<p>minds, which soon cast the political elements back into chaos.
</p>
<p>It was on the above mentioned dajr, that John Adams, as Chair
</p>
<p>man of a Committee, presented a resolution in Congress, which
</p>
<p>was adopted, recommending to the respected assemblage and
</p>
<p>convention of the United Colonies, the establishment of a gov
</p>
<p>ernment suited to the exigency of the times. This resolu
</p>
<p>tion gained favor with the public, and on the seventeenth day
</p>
<p>of June following, Richard Henry Lee moved, and John Ad
</p>
<p>ams seconded the resolution, declaring that "these United Col
</p>
<p>onies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States ;
</p>
<p>and that all political connection between them and Great
</p>
<p>Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved." After daily de
</p>
<p>liberations on these resolutions for over a month, on the sec
</p>
<p>ond of July they were unanimously adopted by Congress ;
</p>
<p>and on the same day it appointed Thomas Jefferson, John

</p>
<p>4 THE FATHERS OF
</p>
<p>Adams, Benjamin Feanklin, Roger Sherman and Robert R.
</p>
<p>Livingston a Committee to draft "a Declaration of Inde
</p>
<p>pendence." Although Mr. Adams was rocked in the cradle of liberty,
</p>
<p>Mr. Jefferson was unanimously known is, her champion ; and
</p>
<p>on him was the honor conferred of drafting the Declaration.
</p>
<p>He did it; and, after some amendments, it was solemnly adopted
</p>
<p>in the city of Philadelphia, on the glorious and ever memora
</p>
<p>ble Fourth of July, 1776. After being read, the great bell
</p>
<p>on the hall began, as if by magic, to ring, reverberating the
</p>
<p>great and immortal, truths just promulgated. Its loud notes
</p>
<p>thundered dismay to the minds of tyrants, but kindled hope
</p>
<p>in the breasts of the people. *
</p>
<p>The enemy having a large naval force in our harbors, sava
</p>
<p>ges on our frontiers, treason in our camps, spies in our cities,
</p>
<p>gold in their coffers, and gibbets in their eye  the fawning
</p>
<p>sycophant, the man who wanted peace in his day, the go-
</p>
<p>between threatening and promising ; and last, the cowardly
</p>
<p>sympathizer with the hated foe  all these to other men would
</p>
<p>have appeared unsurmountable obstacles. But in the face
</p>
<p>of all  God bless them they boldly stepped forward, deter
</p>
<p>mined to be free, leaving themselves no alternative but " lib
</p>
<p>erty or death."
</p>
<p>They had the sagacity to determine the right, and the cour
</p>
<p>age to maintain it. While others were wavering, they were
</p>
<p>firm ; they could neither be courted, intimidated nor bribed ;
</p>
<p>the wealth of the Indies would have been to them as dust.
</p>
<p>No royal standard could have induced them to forsake the
</p>
<p>standard of liberty. In the darkest hour a halo bf glory
</p>
<p>surrounded them  a secret self-sustaining influence, which
</p>
<p>dispelled all gloom. They gathered from the never changing
</p>
<p>laws of human nature, that mankind, without regard to race,
</p>
<p>condition, country, clime or color, desired and deserved every
</p>
<p>where to be free.
</p>
<p>Thus, " life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness " are enun
</p>
<p>ciated in the Declaration of Independence as the inherent

</p>
<p>rights of man ; " and to secure these rights governments are
</p>
<p>THE REVOLUTION. 5
</p>
<p>instituted among men, deriving their just power from the
</p>
<p>consent of the governed."
</p>
<p>Here Mr. Jefferson not only sets forth and enumerated the
</p>
<p>rights, but he positively asserts that to secure them is the
</p>
<p>chief object of governments. He discards the idea of gov
</p>
<p>erning by '' divine, right," and shows that governments should
</p>
<p>be created, not against, but by the will and consent of the
</p>
<p>governed. The power to rule is. always lodged with the peo
</p>
<p>ple, and put in motion by. the will of the majority.
</p>
<p>This was the, foundation laid down in the Bill of Rights ;
</p>
<p>and wherever it has been steadily adhered to, liberty has been
</p>
<p>protected, life has been secure, property well guarded, and
</p>
<p>unbounded prosperity has everywhere been the reward, to
</p>
<p>such a degree, that it has no parallel in the history of man
</p>
<p>kind. God, in his infinite wisdom, decreed that the man who
</p>
<p>wrote the Declaration, and the man who advocated it, were
</p>
<p>the last living witnesses of its adoption by the American
</p>
<p>Congress, and the latest, survivors of those who subscribed it
</p>
<p>on the Fourth of July. Charles Carroll, being absent on a
</p>
<p>secret mission on the fourth, subscribed it afterwards.
</p>
<p>On the anniversary of the fiftieth year from the day the
</p>
<p>Declaration of Independence was adopted, they both departed
</p>
<p>this life. When the sun of the glorious Jubilee shone in un
</p>
<p>clouded and meridian splendor, during the very hour on which,
</p>
<p>fifty years before, the Declaration was read by him and
</p>
<p>adopted by Congress, Thomas Jefferson died, exulting that
</p>
<p>that was the day and the hour. Just as the sun was saluting
</p>
<p>with his parting rays the same glorious day, and during the
</p>
<p>very hour on which, fifty years before, the Declaration of In
</p>
<p>dependence was read from the State House to the citizens of
</p>
<p>Philadelphia, John Adams expired, exclaiming, " It is a great
</p>
<p>and glorious day ;" and while giving utterance to the last
</p>
<p>word he departed.
</p>
<p>These great men always understood the design and end of
</p>

</p>
<p>They had no model in Grecian or Roman history to build
</p>
<p>from ; but took as their guide the desire of all men to be
</p>
<p>free. Liberty was the chief corner-stone ; they claimed it as
</p>
<p>a gift from the Almighty, coupled with humanity, equality
</p>
<p>and justice." With such a natural, stable, and solid founda
</p>
<p>tion, it shadowed forth the noblest effort of human wisdom.
</p>
<p>It was under the foregoing principles that the war of the
</p>
<p>Revolution was commenced, and 60 triumphantly brought to
</p>
<p>its close. It was the departure from those principles, when
</p>
<p>the organic law of the general government was formed, that
</p>
<p>induced the great and good Lafayette to remark, " That he
</p>
<p>would never have drawn his sword in the cause of America
</p>
<p>if he had thought that thereby he was founding a land of
</p>
<p>slavery." Among the enemies of slavery could be counted Washing
</p>
<p>ton, Jefferson, Adams, Franklin, Sherman, Livingston, Patrick
</p>
<p>Henry, Madison, Hancock, Morris, St. Clair, the Randolphs 
</p>
<p>John and Thomas. Add to the. above the rest of the signers
</p>
<p>of the Declaration, backed up by the great document itself.
</p>
<p>We defy and challenge the world to show one single patriot
</p>
<p>of the Revolution who was in favor of Slavery, or advocated
</p>
<p>its extension. Some desired its gradual extinction, but not
</p>
<p>one can be named who spoke in favor of its remaining as a
</p>
<p>permanent Institution. Well may the poet exclaim :
</p>
<p>" The tender ties of parent, husband, frierjd,
</p>
<p>All bonds of nature, all in slavery end.
</p>
<p>All other sorrows virtue may endure,
</p>
<p>And find submission more than half a cure,
</p>
<p>But slavery, virtue dreads it as her grave.
</p>
<p>Patience is meanness in a slave.

<p>Now is the dawning of a better day.

<p>THE REVOLUTION.
</p>
<p>WHAT SLAVERY DID FOR THE CONSTITUTION.
</p>
<p>The War of the Revolution having been brought to a suc
</p>
<p>cessful termination, the Colonies began to feel the need of " a
</p>
<p>more perfect union." Surrounded as they were by savage
</p>
<p>tribes, self-defence and the general welfare demanded some
</p>
<p>thing more for their protection. Thus, in 1787, a Convention as
</p>
<p>sembled in Philadelphia and laid the foundations of our Na
</p>
<p>tional Government. Notwithstanding the Revolution had
</p>
<p>been fought and won on the doctrine of equal rights, yet,
</p>
<p>when the colonies formed a national compact, they set aside
</p>
<p>the principles on which their liberties had been gained.
</p>
<p>The 3d clause of Section 2d, article 1st, relating to repre
</p>
<p>sentatives and taxes. Capital in general is subject to taxa
</p>
<p>tion ; but capital invested in slaves is, in addition, allowed rep
</p>
<p>resentation. " The number of representatives shall not exceed
</p>
<p>one for every thirty thousand." This excludes Indians not
</p>
<p>taxed, but negro slaves are counted as three to five. The
</p>
<p>practical operation of this clause in the Constitution is, that
</p>
<p>ten white men owning 50,000 slaves would be allowed one
</p>
<p>Representative in the lower branch of Congress ; while ten
</p>
<p>who had invested a similar amount of capital, or ten times the
</p>
<p>amount in lands or merchandise would have nothing to say ex
</p>
<p>cept one vote each. They would just lack 29,990 more white
</p>
<p>persons to be entitled to a representative. Their capital in
</p>
<p>vested in real estate and merchandise might be taxed, but to
</p>
<p>be represented also, they would have to invest it in negro
</p>
<p>slaves. '
</p>
<p>In a speech delivered in the Tremont Temple, Boston, Mass.,
</p>
<p>by Robert Toombs of Georgia, Jan. 24th, 1856, he said of the
</p>
<p>above clause : " This provision strengthens slavery by giving
</p>
<p>the existing slave holding states many more representatives
</p>
<p>in Congress than they would have if slaves were considered
</p>
<p>only as property. Twenty Representatives in Congress hold
</p>
<p>their seats to-day by virtue of this clause."

<p>eight hundred and eight, but a tax or duty may. be imposed
</p>
<p>on such importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each
</p>
<p>person," This section recognized the slave trade for a period of twenty
</p>
<p>years, or until 1808. Mr. Martin, of Maryland, one of the dele
</p>
<p>gates, proposed to amend that clause, so as to prohibit the slave
</p>
<p>trade. For, said he, it is inconsistent-with the principles of the
</p>
<p>Revolution.. But Mr. Rutledge, of South Carolina, immediately
</p>
<p>jumped to his feet and remarked,, that the true question was,
</p>
<p>whether the Southern States shall or shall not be parties to
</p>
<p>the. Union. Pinkney, of the same State, remarked that South
</p>
<p>Carolina would never accept the Constitution if it prohibited
</p>
<p>the slave-trade. After which Mr. Rutledge remarked, if the
</p>
<p>convention think that North Carolina, South Carolina and
</p>
<p>Georgia will ever agree to be parties, unless their right to im
</p>
<p>port slaves be untouched, the expectation is vain.
</p>
<p>The article, was. so altered as to allow the importation of
</p>
<p>slaves until 1800, but this was too short a time. Pinkney, of
</p>
<p>South Carolina, moved to strike out 1800 and insert 1808, and
</p>
<p>the motion was carried.
</p>
<p>In the original draft of the Declaration of Independence,
</p>
<p>the slave trade, is denounced as piratical warfare. These
</p>
<p>denunciations were struck out of the Declaration of Independ
</p>
<p>ence in compliance to South Carolina and Georgia, who had
</p>
<p>never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves, and
</p>
<p>who, on the contrary, wished to continue it.  Writings of

</p>
<p>In the Sputh Carolina Convention, Judge Pendleton ob

<p>North Carolina, allowed the importation of negroes. Their
</p>
<p>reason for so doing was that during the last war they lost vast
</p>
<p>numbers of them, which loss they wished to supply.

<p>the prejudices and interests of a portion of the Southern
</p>
<p>States. Zd Story Com. Con. 1828, 1829.
</p>
<p>Mr. Morris, of Pennsylvania, thought it would avoid am
</p>
<p>biguity by making the clause read thus : " The importation of
</p>
<p>slaves into North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia shall
</p>
<p>not be prohibited." He wished it to be known that that part of
</p>
<p>the Constitution toas a compact with those States.
</p>
<p>The 2d section of article IV. of the Constitution reads
</p>
<p>thus : " No person held to service or labor in one State under
</p>
<p>the laws thereof escaping into another shall, in consequence
</p>
<p>of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such ser
</p>
<p>vice or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party
</p>
<p>to whom such service or labor may be due." This was inserted
</p>
<p>in the Constitution by the same influence. Butler and Pink
</p>
<p>ney, of South Carolina, moved to require fugitive slaves and
</p>
<p>servants to be delivered up like criminals.
</p>
<p>Why the word slave was left out of the Constitution. The
</p>
<p>Northern delegates, owing to their peculiar scruples on the
</p>
<p>subject of slavery, did not choose to have the word slave men
</p>
<p>tioned. 4 Ell, Deb. 175.
</p>
<p>Story says that it was agreed that slaves should be repre
</p>
<p>sented under the milder appellation of " other persons," not as
</p>
<p>free persons, but only in proportion of three-fifths. The clause
</p>
<p>was in substance borrowed from that passed by the Continen
</p>
<p>tal Congress on the 18th of April, 1783.  2d Story Com. 641.
</p>
<p>The 15th clause of the 8th section of the 1st article of the
</p>
<p>Constitution, provides for calling forth the militia to execute
</p>
<p>the laws of the Union, sxtvpr ess. insurrections, and repel inva
</p>
<p>sions. Gov. Livingston of N.J. , from the General Committee,
</p>
<p>reported this clause as it stands in the Constitution.
</p>
<p>Madison, Randolph, and other patriots kept the words ser
</p>
<p>vant and slave from being inserted in that instrument, and

<p>substituted in their stead service and person.

<p>10 THE FATHERS OF

<p>itance from Great Britain, long before the Revolution. For
</p>
<p>over one hundred and fifty years slaves had been held by the
</p>
<p>Colonists, and if the Constitution had set a limit to the traffic
</p>
<p>on land, as it did on the sea, we should not have had the pres

<p>ent rebellion.
</p>
<p>Thus the Union, through the Constitution, was bound up
</p>
<p>with the sinews and cemented with the blood of the African
</p>
<p>slave. The anti-democratic feature of the Federal Constitution
</p>
<p>was always viewed by the patriots of the Revolution with a
</p>
<p>jealous eye. James Madison, in a letter to Edmund Randolph,
</p>
<p>dated New York, April 8th, 1787, remarks : " It is also already
</p>
<p>seen by many, and must by degrees be seen by all, that unless
</p>
<p>the Union be organized efficiently on republican principles,
</p>
<p>innovations of a much more objectionable form may be ob

<p>character, opinions and designs of the managers and actors in

<p>the war of Independence. We now purpose to admit what

<p>In governments they denied and repudiated the dogma of

<p>shave been continued only for the benefit of the craft. They

<p>the United States, took place in 1789. His re-election in
</p>
<p>1793. He gathered around him as his chief advisers, such
</p>
<p>men as Thomas Jefferson and Edmund Randolph for Cabinet
</p>
<p>officers, men who were and are well known to have been dia
</p>
<p>metrically opposed to slavery in every form.
</p>
<p>John Adams, who was elected in 1797, called to his Cabinet
</p>
<p>Timothy Pickering, Oliver Wolcott, James McHenry, Joseph
</p>
<p>Habersham and Charles Lee. All had previously been mem

<p>bers of Washington's Cabinet.
</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson, elected Nov. 1801, and re-elected in 1805,

</p>
<p>Adams Secretary of State. During these several Adminis-
</p>
<p>THE REVOLUTION. 13
</p>
<p>trations, Congress passed no less than four slave trade acts.
</p>
<p>The first is the act of 1807. The second is the act of 1818.
</p>
<p>The third is the act of 1819.
</p>
<p>Its first section of the last authorizes the President to employ
</p>
<p>armed vessels of the United States to enforce the acts of Con
</p>
<p>gress prohibiting the slave trade.
</p>
<p>The fourth is the act of 1820, making the slave trade piracy.
</p>
<p>The great blow given to slavery by the Declaration of In
</p>
<p>dependence, caused Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, in 1780,
</p>
<p>to pass acts for its abolition. New York followed in 1799, by
</p>
<p>gradual emancipation, to be completed in 1827. New Jersey
</p>
<p>passed an act in 1784 to gradually emancipate, to be completed
</p>
<p>in 1820. Rhode Island, in 1784. Connecticutin 1797. New
</p>
<p>Hampshire abolished slavery in her constitution. "Vermont
</p>
<p>jdid the same, and was admitted into the Union March 4th,
</p>
<p>1791. The North West Territory was made free under the
</p>
<p>Ordinance of 1787. Maine came into the Union with a free
</p>
<p>Constitution March 3d, 1820.
</p>
<p>Thus for a period of 28 years the General Government was
</p>
<p>managed by men opposed to slavery. In fact nearly all civil
</p>
<p>ized nations, at that time, were arrayed against it. An act in
</p>
<p>Great Britain, in 1807, made the slave trade unlawful. Den
</p>
<p>mark refused to admit African slaves in her Colonies after
</p>
<p>1804. The Congress of Vienna, in 1815, pronounced for the
</p>
<p>abolition of the trade. France abolished it in 1817. So did
</p>
<p>Spain ; the acts to take effect after 1820. Portugal abolished
</p>
<p>it in 1818. HEAR THEIR OPINIONS OF SLAVERY :
</p>
<p>In a letter to Robert Morris, dated Mount Vernon, April

<p>a man living who wishes more sincerely than I do, to see a

<p>plan adopted for the abolition of it. But there is only one

<p>proper and effectual mode by which it can be accomplished ;

<p>and that is by legislative authority, and this, as far as my suf

</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson, in a letter to a friend, dated July 31,

<p>1814, remarks : " What an incomprehensible machine is man,
</p>
<p>who can endure toil, famine, stripes, imprisonment, and death
</p>
<p>itself, in vindication of his own liberty, and the next moment
</p>
<p>be deaf to all those motives whose power supported him
</p>
<p>through his trial, and inflict on his fellow-man a bondage, one
</p>
<p>hour of which is fraught with more misery than ages of that
</p>
<p>which he rose in rebellion to oppose."
</p>
<p>" We must wait with patience the workings of an overruling

<p>Providence, and hope that a way is preparing for the deliver

<p>shall be full. When their groans shall have involved heaven

<p>itself in darkness, doubtless a God of Justice will awaken to
</p>
<p>their distress. Nothing is more certainly written in the book of
</p>
<p>fate, than that this people shaU be free."
</p>
<p>James Madison, in speaking against the slave trade, said :
</p>
<p>" It is to be hoped that by expressing a national disapproba
</p>
<p>tion of the trade we may destroy it, and save our country
</p>
<p>from reproaches, and our posterity from the imbecility ever
</p>
<p>attendant on a country filled with slaves." Furthermore, he
</p>
<p>said, " It is wrong to admit in the Constitution the idea that
</p>
<p>there can be property in man."
</p>
<p>James Monroe, in a speech in the Virginia Convention,
</p>
<p>said : "We have found that this evil has preyed upon the very

<p>THE REVOLUTION. 15
</p>
<p>Our entire volume might be filled up with extracts from
</p>
<p>these great men's writings and speeches. From 1789 until
</p>
<p>1817, a period of twenty-eight years, so distasteful were the
</p>
<p>slave sentiments of South Carolina statesmen, that through
</p>
<p>eight successive presidential terms not one of its leading men
</p>
<p>ever held a seat in the Gabinet of any of the Presidents, save
</p>
<p>and except Paul Hamilton, Secretary of the Navy under Mad
</p>
<p>ison, in 1809 ; and we have the best of evidence that he was
</p>
<p>a man of liberal views, or he would not have been chosen for
</p>
<p>one of the Cabinet officers.
</p>
<p>SATAN ENTERED PARADISE.
</p>
<p>It was on the 8th day of October, 1817, that the Devil en
</p>
<p>tered Paradise. John C. Calhoun, then young, with princi
</p>
<p>ples little understood, was chosen by James Monroe as his
</p>
<p>Secretary of War. Up to this time no question had arisen in
</p>
<p>the councils of the General Government that threatened any
</p>
<p>serious disturbance. In 1819 and 1820 Missouri, formed out
</p>
<p>of the Louisiana purchase, organized with a slave Constitution,
</p>
<p>and knocked at the door of the Union for admission. This
</p>
<p>was the first time since the adoption of the Federal Consti
</p>
<p>tution that slavery presented itself in a political aspect.
</p>
<p>There was a peculiar clause in the Missouri Constitution, not
</p>
<p>only establishing slavery, but also forbidding any legislative
</p>
<p>interference with it. This was something uncommon in State
</p>
<p>constitutions, and the doctrine of placing any State institu
</p>
<p>tions above and beyond the reach of legislative authority was
</p>
<p>received by many as dangerous. Many other objections were
</p>
<p>made, but finally the controversy settled down on the single
</p>
<p>question of slavery : Has a State a right to have slavery if she
</p>
<p>chooses ?
</p>
<p>In this controversy the excitement ran very high ; sharp
</p>
<p>words were used by both disputants ; and a division of the
</p>
<p>Union was threatened on the line of slavery. Finally the ex
</p>
<p>citing controversy was brought to a close by a Compromise,
</p>
<p>which generally leaves both disputants dissatisfied.

</p>
<p>As a sample of how little use a compromise is to either
</p>
<p>16 THE FATHERS OF
</p>
<p>party, I will relate the following of our worthy President :
</p>
<p>When the Pacific Railroad question was up before Congress,
</p>
<p>friends of the New York and Erie Railroad called npon Pres
</p>
<p>ident Lincoln and desired him to use his influence to have
</p>
<p>Congressadopt the broad guage, so that the Erie Railroad could
</p>
<p>run their cars through to California. Mr. Lincoln remarked
</p>
<p>that friends of the Pennsylvania Central Railroad had called
</p>
<p>on him the week before, requesting his influence in favor of a
</p>
<p>narrow guage. Says he, "If I was to grant your request they
</p>
<p>would be dissatisfied, so, gentlemen, I think the best thing I
</p>
<p>can do is to compromise, making it a little wider than the
</p>
<p>track of the Central, and not quite so wide as the Erie."
</p>
<p>Missouri, with slavery in her Constitution, was admitted ;
</p>
<p>but the opponents of slavery secured, as an offset, the aboli
</p>
<p>tion of slavery in all the remaining province of Louisiana
</p>
<p>north and west of the State of Missouri, and north of the
</p>
<p>parallel of 36 degrees 30 minutes.
</p>
<p>Our treaty, wherein Spain ceded us Florida, and the Gen
</p>
<p>eral Government ceded Texas to Spain, (this territorial trade
</p>
<p>having taken place in 1819, and taking the two treaties to
</p>
<p>gether,) very nearly extinguished slave territory in the
</p>
<p>United States. Except the diagram marked out for Arkansas,
</p>
<p>and a few Indian reserves, it cut off all below 36 deg. 30 min.,
</p>
<p>the Missouri Compromise cutting off all that vast expanse of
</p>
<p>Louisiana north of 36 deg. 30 min. This Treaty gave, first to
</p>
<p>Spain, second to Mexico, all the slave territory south of the
</p>
<p>aforesaid line. Coming into the possession of Mexico, it be
</p>
<p>came free. Now add the Ordinance of 1787, ceding the
</p>
<p>Northwest Territory to the General Government, in all of
</p>
<p>which slavery and involuntary servitude, except for crime,
</p>
<p>was forever excluded. By this all the country east of the
</p>
<p>Mississippi, above the Ohio, and out to the Great Lakes, was
</p>
<p>made free. And the Missouri Compromise extinguished it
</p>
<p>north and west of the State of Missouri, and north of the
</p>
<p>parallel of 36 deg. 30 min., except, as before stated, the dia

<p>gram of Arkansas and a few Indian reserves.
</p>
<p>Thus the reader can see that in 1820 Arkansas and Florida
</p>
<p>THE REVOLUTION. 17
</p>
<p>was the only slave territory belonging to the General Govern
</p>
<p>ment. The increase of slave States was stopped. And all the
</p>
<p>vast expanse from the Mississippi river, Lake Michigan,
</p>
<p>Rocky Mountains, and Oregon, by action of the General Gov
</p>
<p>ernment, was all made free territory, and with the consent
</p>
<p>and support of Southern men then in Congress, and approved
</p>
<p>by their constituents at home, who were, almost to a man,
</p>
<p>then opposed to the further extension of slavery.
</p>
<p>The excitement ereated by the discussion of the Missouri
</p>
<p>Compromise had been allayed, and all was calm again. Mr.
</p>
<p>Monroe's term of office was about expiring. Andrew Jack
</p>
<p>son for President, and John C. Calhoun for Vice President,
</p>
<p>both slave holders. In opposition to them was Adams for
</p>
<p>President, and4 Clay for Vice President. Yet nothing was
</p>
<p>said in the campaign to arouse the feelings of either section
</p>
<p>concerning slavery. Jackson, Adams, Clay and Crawford, were
</p>
<p>all candidates for the Presidency in this campaign of 1825.
</p>
<p>Jackson received 99 electoral votes ; Adams 84 ; Crawford
</p>
<p>41 ; and Clay 37. Neither of the persons voted for having
</p>
<p>received a majority of the votes, it devolved Upon the House
</p>
<p>of Representatives to choose from the three highest on the
</p>
<p>list of those voted for by the electors for President ; which
</p>
<p>three were Andrew Jackson, John Q. Adams, and Wm. Craw
</p>
<p>ford. The votes of thirteen States were given for Adams ; the
</p>
<p>votes of seven States for Jackson ; and the votes of four States
</p>
<p>for Crawford. John Quincey Adams having received a ma
</p>
<p>jority of the votes of all the States of the Union was duly
</p>
<p>elected President of the United States, commencing the 4th
</p>
<p>of March, 1825. John C. Calhoun, who had run on the ticket
</p>
<p>with Jackson, received 182 electoral votes, which elected him
</p>
<p>Vice President.
</p>
<p>Mr. Adams was a candidate for re-election in 1829, with
</p>
<p>Richard Rush, of Pennsylvania, for Vice President, both
</p>
<p>from the free States. Jackson and Calhoun, both slave hold
</p>
<p>ers, were the opposition ; yet nothing to arouse the feelings

</p>
<p>concerning slavery was said by either party. The only ques
</p>
<p>tion of importance before the voters, was the right of the peo-
</p>
<p>18 THE FATHERS OF
</p>
<p>pie to govern themselves. This issue was brought forward on
</p>
<p>account of the previous election going to the House, and it
</p>
<p>was openly charged that intrigue and corruption were the
</p>
<p>leading features of it. Jackson received 178 electoral votes,
</p>
<p>Adams only 83. Calhoun did not receive as many as Jackson.
</p>
<p>The falling off was in Georgia, where Mr. Crawford charged
</p>
<p>home on him his connection with the Aaron Burr Plot.
</p>
<p>In the second year of his Vice Presidency, Calhoun and his
</p>
<p>South Carolina friends, seeing that the action of the Federal
</p>
<p>Government had been almost unanimous in favor of freedom ;
</p>
<p>the vast territories, even those that had been acquired from
</p>
<p>France and Spain, being nearly all made free, they perceived
</p>
<p>that slavery was hemmed in, and without an outlet it would
</p>
<p>soon become a burden rather than a profit.
</p>
<p>At this time Calhoun's friends started a paper in Washing
</p>
<p>ton City, called the United States Telegraph. In this paper
</p>
<p>he commenced to advocate the State Rights' doctrine. He
</p>
<p>was very violent for the scheme which he and his slave-holding
</p>
<p>friends had set on foot, for nothing less than a dissolution of
</p>
<p>the Union. This was to be accomplished through the doctrine
</p>
<p>of State Rights. Getting that poison well infused into the
</p>
<p>Democratic party, backed up by so formidable an element, the
</p>
<p>State of South Carolina could quietly retire from the Union.
</p>
<p>To give his ideas more force, Calhoun called a meeting on the
</p>
<p>evening, of the 13th of April. This was Jefferson's birth day.
</p>
<p>His object was to use that great man's name as god-father
</p>
<p>for his new political heresy, Jefferson having died on the 4th
</p>
<p>of July, 1826, and this meeting was in 1830. It was Calhoun's
</p>
<p>design to put words into Jefferson's mouth that he never ut
</p>
<p>tered. But the news got spread about, and a large gathering
</p>
<p>was present ; among the rest, President Jackson, who had
</p>
<p>got an inkling of what was to be. Jackson was called upon to
</p>
<p>act as President of the meeting. After the 24 regular toasts
</p>
<p>were delivered, eulogizing the great Jefferson, some one in
</p>
<p>the assembly called for a volunteer toast from the President.

</p>
<p>This toast not only proved Jackson's far-seeing statesman-
</p>
<p>| ship, but also his devoted patriotism. He rose fromhis seat,
</p>
<p>THE REVOLUTION. 19
</p>
<p>all eyes upon him. In an instant the excitement and bustle of
</p>
<p>the crowd was hushed into the stillness of death. Without
</p>
<p>pencil or paper, he did not read anything before prepared, but
</p>
<p>spoke directly from his heart : " Our Federal Union. It must
</p>
<p>be preserved." What a storm of applause followed ! Jackson
</p>
<p>did not say it ought, or it should, but " It must be preserved."
</p>
<p>These were words spoken in the right place and at the right
</p>
<p>time, and the American citizen does not live, without his mind
</p>
<p>is rotten with treason, but will say Amen to the senti
</p>
<p>ment, and tell it to his children and their children's children,
</p>
<p>to be repeated in all coming time. The general joy and good
</p>
<p>feeling that had been kindled by the President's happy hit,
</p>
<p>was interrupted by some friend of Calhoun's, who got on a
</p>
<p>seat and loudly called for a toast from him. After quiet was
</p>
<p>restored, Calhoun read the following :
</p>
<p>" The Union next to our liberties the most dear. May we
</p>
<p>all remember that it can only be preserved by respecting the
</p>
<p>rights of the States, and distributing equally the benefits and
</p>
<p>burdens of the Union."
</p>
<p>The snake now came stealthily from the grass. The Union
</p>
<p>was put second to our liberties, when it was the only thing
</p>
<p>that gave us liberty. The rights of the States was then lug
</p>
<p>ged inand placed paramount to the Union, when any man
</p>
<p>of judgment knows that if the Union was dissolved all the
</p>
<p>rights remaining to the States would be the right of force, to
</p>
<p>fight and use each other up  always preparing for war, en
</p>
<p>gaged in war, or suing for peace. This would be the legacy
</p>
<p>left to the States if the Union was gone.
</p>
<p>As we before remarked. Jefferson was to- be made god
</p>
<p>father to this State Rights heresy. This doctrine of state
</p>
<p>rights was, and is yet, that a State has a right to annul an act of
</p>
<p>Congress, and resist by force, if need be, its execution. The
</p>
<p>Virginia Resolutions of '98-99 were so warped and miscon
</p>
<p>strued by Calhoun, as to favor the above heresy. Mr. Madi
</p>
<p>son, their author, still lived on his farm ; and inletters to Mr.

</p>
<p>Maguire and Everett, and in his daily intercourse with his fel
</p>
<p>low citizens, denounced the use that was being made of his
</p>
<p>20 THE FATHERS OF
</p>
<p>resolutions. Mr. Madison's interpretation of their meaning,
</p>
<p>was that they sustained and advised only constitutional means
</p>
<p>of redress, while those of Calhoun counseled violence and
</p>
<p>revolution. Instead, says Madison, of Virginia counseling nul
</p>
<p>lification doctrine, the occasion was viewed as a proper one
</p>
<p>for exemplifying its devotion to public order, and acqui
</p>
<p>escence in laws which it deemed unconstitutional, while those
</p>
<p>laws were not repealed  meaning the alien and sedition laws.
</p>
<p>Calhoun had also dragged the Kentucky Resolutions of '99 into
</p>
<p>the support of his heresy, claiming Thos. Jefferson as their
</p>
<p>author. Thus the celebration of his birth-day although Jef
</p>
<p>ferson was not the author. The resolutions were passed at
</p>
<p>the same time as those of Virginia, and contemplating the
</p>
<p>same grievance ; yet all the remedies they proposed were
</p>
<p>pointed out in the Federal Constitution. Both sets of resolu
</p>
<p>tions contemplated only Constitutional remedies. But " nulli
</p>
<p>fication," says Madison, " inserts deadly poison in the institu
</p>
<p>tion we had labored to construct." Mr. Madison also under
</p>
<p>stood Mr. Jefferson's views, which were likewise being mis
</p>
<p>represented. December, 18, 1831, Madison, in answer to a letter from Mr.
</p>
<p>Townsend, of South Carolina, remarks : " You ask whether Mr.
</p>
<p>Jefferson was really the author of the Kentucky resolutions,
</p>
<p>wherein the word ' nullify ' is used, (though not in the sense of
</p>
<p>South Carolina nullification.) The inference is that he was
</p>
<p>not. That Mr. Jefferson ever asserted a right of a single State
</p>
<p>to resist the execution of an act of Congress, is counteracted
</p>
<p>by nothing known to be said or done by him."
</p>
<p>We have now proved that the Virginia Resolutions contem
</p>
<p>plated only Constitutional means of redress ; also, that those
</p>
<p>of Kentucky were harmless, being similar to those of Virgin
</p>
<p>ia. That James Madison while living repudiated the State
</p>
<p>Rights heresy, and vindicated the views of Thomas Jefferson,
</p>
<p>who was then dead, by proving that he held the doctrine that
</p>
<p>it was not necessary to find a right to coerce in the Federal
</p>
<p>articles, that being inherent in the very nature of a compact.

<p>Having proved by their own testimony that Madison and Jef-
</p>
<p>THE REVOLUTION. 21
</p>
<p>ferson were both opposed to the heresy of State Bights, and
</p>
<p>that they both claimed for the General Government the right
</p>
<p>to exercise its authority and power to overcome resistance;
</p>
<p>Therefore this heresy did not originate with either the author
</p>
<p>of the Declaration of Independence, or the author of the Consti
</p>
<p>tution of the United States ; but with the champion of the
</p>
<p>slave power, in the person of John C. Calhoun of South Car-
</p>
<p>olinia. We have now arrived at the point to show the real designs
</p>
<p>of the nullifiers. Men seldom act without motives, either in
</p>
<p>an individual capacity or collectively. When the motives are
</p>
<p>evil, and not likely to be seconded by the public, an ardent de
</p>
<p>sire for success compels the manager or managers to substi
</p>
<p>tute other reasons more in harmony with the feelings of the
</p>
<p>people whom they aim to deceive.
</p>
<p>Although slavery yet lingered, (would to God it had died)
</p>
<p>no one was bold enough to pray for its recovery, and nearly
</p>
<p>all would have rejoiced over its death. Southern men had by
</p>
<p>their votes in Congress shut it out of all the Territories of the
</p>
<p>United States. Many of the organized states had, and were
</p>
<p>abolishing it. The General Government was counted as its
</p>
<p>enemy. The moral and political sentiment of the entire na
</p>
<p>tion was set against it. Against such a heavy sea of pub
</p>
<p>lic and Legislative opinion, few men in any age would have
</p>
<p>stepped forward as its champion.
</p>
<p>South Carolina, the only State in the Union, except Mississippi,
</p>
<p>that has more slaves within its borders than free white cit
</p>
<p>izens, furnished the man. He would have come from Missis
</p>
<p>sippi, but for the reason that it had only a surplus of 14,160
</p>
<p>slaves, while South Carolina could boast of 110,421 surplus
</p>
<p>above her white population. Thus the demon, with all the
</p>
<p>venom of eternal hate, came right from the very throne of
</p>
<p>the slave power. John C. Calhoun was his name.
</p>
<p>After surveying the situation, he began to mature the plan
</p>
<p>of attack. The will of the people was known, to be against
</p>
<p>the wishes of him and his friends. Nothing was left for him

<p>but to throw himself back on the rights of the States. This
</p>
<p>22 THE FATHERS OF
</p>
<p>was admirable, but the object was first to unite the people
</p>
<p>of South Carolina second, that being done, all the slave
</p>
<p>States, like ripe fruit, would fall into the lap of Nullification.
</p>
<p>Presuming that a State had an inherent right to secede, the
</p>
<p>nextiihing was to convince the people of the South that it
</p>
<p>was their interest to do so. And for this purpose he used the
</p>
<p>Tariff. The South, being an agricultural region, was easily
</p>
<p>convinced that a high tariff on foreign imports was injurious
</p>
<p>to them. He next undertook to explain to the South that these
</p>
<p>high duties were placed on specific articles, and was done, as
</p>
<p>special favor, to protect local interests. Thus he said to the
</p>
<p>people of the South, You are being taxed to support Northern
</p>
<p>manufacturers. And it was on this popular issue he planted
</p>
<p>his nullification flag, and gathered around it his friends and
</p>
<p>dupes. The throne of the slave power, located in South Car
</p>
<p>olina, was his backer, and the slaveholders throughout the
</p>
<p>South, who loved slavery better than they did the Union, were
</p>
<p>his friends, and his dupes were such of the Democrats from
</p>
<p>the free States as had become alarmed for the safety of the
</p>
<p>party, and made a close alliance, by agreeing to drop the good
</p>
<p>old democratic doctrine of the rights of man, founded in human
</p>
<p>naturej and advocated by the apostle of democracy, Thomas
</p>
<p>Jefferson. These men threw all such rights to the wind, and
</p>
<p>greedily seized the great instrument of the slave power, State
</p>
<p>Bights. This new bastard democracy meant the right to de
</p>
<p>stroy, peaceably or by force, (when ready,) the Federal Union.
</p>
<p>It was thought necessary, in, order to get this matter fairly
</p>
<p>before the nation, to call a Convention. So the 24th day of
</p>
<p>November, 1832, was set as the time, and Columbia, South
</p>
<p>Carolina, as the place of meeting.
</p>
<p>This was the first open renouncement that had ever been
</p>
<p>made in any State against the General Government. And
</p>
<p>here it is proper to give Calhoun's Vision, or dream, as he some
</p>
<p>times called it, and the origin qf the spot cm the back qf his hand :
</p>
<p>It was on the Sabbath, late in the month of October, 1832,

<p>Calhoun, after a chat with his friends, retired to his room, re
</p>
<p>solved to pen the article, or forge the wedge, that was to
</p>
<p>THE REVOLUTION. 23
</p>
<p>divide the Union of the States. With treason in his heart,
</p>
<p>and treachery in his soul, all alone he sat down at his table
</p>
<p>and commenced to write the Ordinance of Nullification, or ar
</p>
<p>ticle cf dissolution. THE VISION.
</p>
<p>"While sitting at the table," says Calhoun, "having taken the
</p>
<p>precaution to lock my door, to prevent the possibility of being
</p>
<p>annoyed, I thought I heard it softly open. I was then en
</p>
<p>gaged in writing the ordinance to be read at the meeting to
</p>
<p>be held at Columbia, South Carolina, the next month. My
</p>
<p>back was towards the door, and being engaged in deep
</p>
<p>thought, I did not turn round again. A noise struck my ear
</p>
<p>like the agitation of flowing robes. I looked around, and be*
</p>
<p>hold a tall figure stood erect. A death-like fluttering seized
</p>
<p>my heart ; my nerves gave way ; my sinews became weak
</p>
<p>and soft like flesh ; my entire frame became unstrung, and
</p>
<p>trembled, as by instinct, for its own preservation.
</p>
<p>" When these awful sensations had passed over me, I rallied
</p>
<p>as though frightened from the effects of a dream. On open
</p>
<p>ing my eyes, behold an officer, wearing the uniform of the
</p>

</p>
<p>eyes fixed upon my manuscript. He gradually raised his
</p>
<p>eyes from the paper, and looked earnestly into mine. I re
</p>
<p>turned the gaze as well as I could. We remained motionless
</p>
<p>for thirty seconds, when all at once I felt a chilly sensation of
</p>
<p>awe pass through me. I spoke, without effort, these words,
</p>
<p>and I never shall forget them : It is the features qf the im
</p>
<p>mortal Washington; thou hast come from the realms cf the dead.
</p>
<p>For what hast thou come, 0, hero of the Revolution ?

<p>desist. South Carolina produced one of the greatest martyrs
</p>
<p>to liberty, in the person of Hayne, and let it not be written
</p>
<p>on her history that she also gave birth to the blackest traitor

<p>there will be prosperity ; in union there will be happiness ;
</p>
<p>24 THE FATHERS OF

<p>in union there will be liberty. Dissolution is political anni
</p>
<p>hilation ; it would be death.'
</p>
<p>"Finishing these remarks, he caught .hold of my right hand,
</p>
<p>and pressed his thumb hard on its back, and remarking,
</p>
<p>'Across the articles of dissolution, stretched the skeleton of
</p>
<p>Hayne, and on the back of your hand will a black spot be
</p>
<p>visible through the remainder of your life.' "
</p>
<p>Calhoun has told this to several of his friends, and always
</p>
<p>remarking he could not tell whether it was a vision or a
</p>
<p>dream. In after years, when he would become worked up to
</p>
<p>great mental excitement in his debates on the right of seces
</p>
<p>sion or nullification, he invariably fell to rubbing the black
</p>
<p>spot on his hand, as though it annoyed him.
</p>
<p>If the black spot had appeared on Calhoun's head, instead
</p>
<p>of his hand, it could easily be accounted for on the ground
</p>
<p>that he was the first victim to that awful Southern scourge,
</p>
<p>" nigger on the brain." But we are rather inclined to think that
</p>
<p>his was only a severe case of a previous malady known as
</p>
<p>" plantation grip."
</p>
<p>Calhoun sent down his ordinance to South Carolina ; and on
</p>
<p>the appointed day, in November, the nullifiers assembled at
</p>
<p>Columbia, and raised the banner of Secession. The chief griev
</p>
<p>ance set forth was the Tariff, which they alleged was passed
</p>
<p>to protect manufacturers of the North at the expense of the
</p>
<p>South. The most remarkable thing they stated in the or
</p>
<p>dinance was, that they intended to maintain their resolve to
</p>
<p>withdraw from the Union at airy hazard, even to the force of
</p>
<p>arms. This ordinance was signed by over one hundred of the
</p>
<p>wealthiest slaveholders in the State of South Carolina, and
</p>
<p>returned to Calhoun. The Tariff was, as we before stated,
</p>
<p>only adopted as a means to raise the popular outcry. The
</p>
<p>Tariff could easily have been changed by changing Congress ;
</p>
<p>therefore there was no cause for secession on that ground.
</p>
<p>But we will now prove by incontestable evidence where
</p>
<p>the real trouble was. About this time Calhoun delivered a

</p>
<p>speech in the Senate. It was after his Vice Presidency had
</p>
<p>expired, some time in 1833. He remarked : " The contest
</p>
<p>THE REVOLUTION. 25
</p>
<p>will in fact be a contest between power and liberty, and
</p>
<p>such he considered the present contest between South Caro
</p>
<p>lina and the General Government a contest in which the *
</p>
<p>weaker section, with peculiar labor, productions and situation,
</p>
<p>has at stake all that is dear to freemen."
</p>
<p>One man in the Senate and one in the House had sagacity
</p>
<p>enough to see the black pmn in tlve, fence.
</p>
<p>Daniel Webster, in answer to Calhoun, said : " Sir, the
</p>
<p>world will scarcely believe that this whole controversy, and
</p>
<p>all the desperate means which its support requires, has no
</p>
<p>other foundation than a difference of opinion between a ma
</p>
<p>jority of the people of South Carolina on the one side, and a
</p>
<p>vast majority of the people of the United States on the
</p>
<p>other. The world will not credit the fact. We who hear and
</p>
<p>see it can ourselves hardly yet believe it."
</p>
<p>John Q. Adams was the member in the House. He said :
</p>
<p>" In opposion to the compromise of Mr. Clay, no victim is
</p>
<p>necessary, and yet you propose to bind us hand and foot,
</p>
<p>to pour out our blood upon the altar, to appease the unnatural
</p>
<p>discontent of the South  a discontent having deeper root than
</p>
<p>the Tariff, and will continue when that is forgotten."
</p>
<p>If Mr. Adams had put on the mantle of Jeremiah, or
</p>
<p>Isaiah, he could not have surpassed in prophetic accuracy, or
</p>
<p>wise discrimination, the above last paragraph.
</p>
<p>Mr. Benton says, in his Thirty Years, that the remarks
</p>
<p>of Calhoun had the appearance of laying an anchor to the
</p>
<p>windward for a new agitation on a new subject after the Tariff
</p>
<p>was dead.
</p>
<p>President Jackson, in his message to Congress, in 1 832-33,
</p>
<p>puts the hollow cheat of State Rights to rest : " The right of
</p>
<p>a people of a single State to absolve themselves at will, and
</p>
<p>without the consent of the other States, from their most sol
</p>
<p>emn obligations, and hazard the liberties and happiness of
</p>
<p>millions comprising this nation, cannot be acknowledged.
</p>
<p>Such authority is believe^ to be wholly repugnant, both to

<p>tuted, and the objects which it is expressly formed to obtain."
</p>
<p>26 DESPERATE SCHEMES OF
</p>
<p>This was a bomb into the camp of the nullifiers, and gave
</p>
<p>them to understand what they must expect if they still per
</p>
<p>sisted in their treasonable designs. Jackson held to the Union
</p>
<p>without any ifs or buts. A favorite remark of his, in conver
</p>
<p>sation with friends, was , that no sectionalinterest or sectional
</p>
<p>discontent shouldever be allowed to weaken the bonds or break
</p>
<p>up the Federal Union.
</p>
<p>When Calhoun saw these unconditional Union sentiments
</p>
<p>in Jackson's.message, he knew it was a salvo from the peace
</p>
<p>maker, shot only across the bow, as a warning to heave to.
</p>
<p>He knew well that the next discharge would be a broadside
</p>
<p>that would shiver his piratical craft to atoms. So Captain
</p>
<p>Calhoun, with his brig South Carolina, and ordinance, rounded
</p>
<p>to, and continued under the guns of the frigate Constitution,
</p>
<p>Commodore Andrew Jackson, commander, until Mr. Clay,
</p>
<p>under the instruction of one of the Commodore's aids, Mr.
</p>
<p>Clayton, prepared articles of capitulation, which the piratical
</p>
<p>captain of the South Carolina readily signed, acknowledging
</p>
<p>the power of the Constitution and nationality of her flag.
</p>
<p>As we before mentioned that Calhoun had control of a
</p>
<p>newspaper published in Washington, here is an extract from
</p>
<p>a speech delivered by the Hon. Isaac Hill, of New Hamp
</p>
<p>shire, as to its character : " For the last five years it has been
</p>
<p>laboring to produce a Northern and Southern party, to fan
</p>
<p>the flame of national prejudice, to open wider the breach,
</p>
<p>drive harder in the wedge which shall divide the North from
</p>
<p>the South."
</p>
<p>Thus the reader can see that the slave power used every
</p>
<p>effort to create sectional hate and divide the Union years be
</p>
<p>fore either Thompson, Tappan or Garrison came into the field.
</p>
<p>Thus the storm originated in the most densely slave pop
</p>
<p>ulated region of the South. When it reached the Ship of
</p>
<p>State, the political elements became agitated, darkness cov
</p>
<p>ered the southern horizon, while black darkness hovered

</p>
<p>the vortex of contending elements. The storm and the sea
</p>
<p>appeared in desperate conflict which should secure the

</p>
<p>mighty prize, freighted as it was with the accumulated treas
</p>
<p>ure and precious lives of twenty millions of people, whose
</p>
<p>hopes of happiness were all concentrated there. Old masters
</p>
<p>with different hopes, looked on from afar  some hoping that
</p>
<p>she might sink and be lost in the storm  others shedding
</p>
<p>tears at her distress, and praying that she might survive,
</p>
<p>when all at once the elements became calm, the mist dis
</p>
<p>appeared, and revealed to the wondering millions the great
</p>
<p>ship in all her majestic pride.
</p>
<p>Commodore Jacksfcn had subdued the storm, brought order
</p>
<p>out of confusion, and kindled hopes in the hearts of his coun
</p>
<p>trymen. Would to God we had them now.
</p>
<p>Thus ended the first effort of the slave power to destroy
</p>
<p>the Union. It failed, but did not abandon the enterprise ;
</p>
<p>the darker the prospect, the more desperate grew its friends.
</p>
<p>AN ATTEMPT TO ASSASSINATE PRESIDENT JACKSON  NEW THREATS
</p>
<p>OF DISSOLUTION OF THE UNION.
</p>
<p>The slave power having been defeated in its first attempt
</p>
<p>to destroy the Federal Union by the sagacity and courage of
</p>
<p>Andrew Jackson, withdrew to its den of infamy to devise new
</p>
<p>and desperate schemes for the future. It feared as well as
</p>
<p>hated the man who defeated nullification. Calhoun himself
</p>
<p>became more embittered by reflection, and was frequently
</p>
<p>heard to say that Jackson was a tyrant and despot, and better
</p>
<p>men than he had been hung. In fact, it was no uncommon
</p>
<p>thing at that time to hear threats against the President's life.
</p>
<p>The corrupting influence of the moneyed power of the United
</p>
<p>States Bank joined hands with the slave power, although from
</p>
<p>very different motives. Both would have been delighted to
</p>
<p>have heard of Jackson's assassination. But the plot to over
</p>
<p>throw republican institutions was far more attrocious. In the
</p>
<p>presence of a crime of such magnitude all other crimes grow
</p>
<p>pale. Thus Calhoun had a soul ever ready to betray human
</p>
<p>nature, with a heart as black as night.

<p>South Carolina, who had just died at Washington, and the fu
</p>
<p>neral ceremonies were being conducted in the Hall of Repre
</p>
<p>sentatives, where all had congregated, when the ceremonies
</p>
<p>were over, and the procession had just reached the foot of the
</p>
<p>steps at the eastern portico, President Jackson, accompanied
</p>
<p>by Mr. Woodbury, Secretary of the Treasury, and Mr. Dicker-
</p>
<p>son, Secretary of the Navy, on coming out of the door, at that
</p>
<p>moment a man stepped from the . crowd into the open space
</p>
<p>in front of the President, and at a distance of about eight
</p>
<p>paces, drew a pistol from beneath his cloak  aiming at the
</p>
<p>heart of the President, attempted to fire. The cap exploded
</p>
<p>without igniting the powder in the barrel. He immediately
</p>
<p>drew from beneath his cloak another, which he had held
</p>
<p>ready cocked in his left hand, and pointing as before, this cap
</p>
<p>also exploded without firing the powder in the barrel. At
</p>
<p>this moment the President rushed at him with uplifted cane ;
</p>
<p>-the traitor shrunk back, and Lieutenant Gedney, of the navy,
</p>
<p>knocked him down. He was secured by the bystanders and
</p>
<p>taken before Justice Cranch, who committed him in default of
</p>
<p>bail. His name proved to be Richard Lawrence, an English
</p>
<p>man by birth, and a house-painter by trade. The pistols were
</p>
<p>examined and found loaded. Caps were put on them, and
</p>
<p>both fired without fail, the balls going through inch boards
</p>
<p>thirty feet distant.
</p>
<p>The friends of the President felt it to be a grateful interpo
</p>
<p>sition of the Almighty. All looked upon his escape as miracu
</p>
<p>lous, having its origin in the all-wise providence of God.
</p>
<p>The conduct of the assassin excited and surprised every one.
</p>
<p>The boldness of the undertaking in broad daylight, and in
</p>
<p>a public gathering, was all weighed and turned over. The
</p>
<p>great precaution of the assassin in providing two pistols, fear
</p>
<p>ing one might fail, was argued as evidence of a deep laid
</p>
<p>plot. Various were the surmises, and finally some one sug

<p>shal of the District of Columbia called a council of physicians
</p>
<p>to examine and report. Drs. Caussin and Sewell were the
</p>
<p>TRAITORS IN CONGRESS. 29
</p>
<p>men selected. They made the examination, and concluded not
</p>
<p>to give any official opinion, but to make their report on ques
</p>
<p>tions as they put them, and the answers as he gave them. We
</p>
<p>give a few of the questions and answers to show the leading
</p>
<p>features of his mind.
</p>
<p>Q. Did any one advise you to shoot General Jackson ?
</p>
<p>A. I don't like to say.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you ever been in Congress, and heard the mem
</p>
<p>bers making speeches ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes.
</p>
<p>Q. How did you like the speeches of Calhoun, Clay and
</p>
<p>Webster ?
</p>
<p>A. I liked them well.
</p>
<p>Q. Who would you like to see President ?
</p>
<p>A. Either Calhoun, Clay or Webster.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you friendly to General Jackson ?
</p>
<p>A. No.
</p>
<p>Q. Why not?
</p>
<p>A. Because he is a tyrant.
</p>
<p>We have given enough of this report to show that this
</p>
<p>man, whether deranged or not, had strong prejudices against
</p>
<p>Jackson, and a high opinion of his most bitter enemies ; using
</p>
<p>the word tyrant, a phrase Calhoun was always applying to
</p>
<p>Jackson. His admiration for Calhoun was supposed by many
</p>
<p>to be caused by an affinity of interest, or an accidental union
</p>
<p>of feelings of revenge against a common foe.
</p>
<p>Whether this man was induced to attempt to murder the
</p>
<p>President by listening to his defamer making speeches in
</p>
<p>the Senate, the greatest of which was Calhoun, or whether he
</p>
<p>was secretly hired to assassinate him, God alone can deter
</p>
<p>mine. There is no doubt but the death of Jackson would have
</p>
<p>been received by Calhoun as the tocsin of victory. Add to
</p>
<p>this his deep and long seated revenge, and you have two very
</p>
<p>strong motives in a bad man's heart to commit crime. Either
</p>
<p>Lawrence's intellect was weak, and the storm created by the

<p>slave power drove him to attempt the crime, or he was se-

</p>
<p>the guilt direct or remote on the President's defamers, the
</p>
<p>principal of which was John C. Calhoun.
</p>
<p>We can not dismiss the history of those thrilling events,
</p>
<p>without giving an extract from Jackson's Farewell Address.
</p>
<p>As putting down the attempted disolution of the Union was
</p>
<p>one of the greatest achievements of his Administration, he
</p>
<p>still saw that a new effort would be made. He says : " What
</p>
<p>have you to gain by division and dissolution ? Delude not your
</p>
<p>selves with the belief that a breach once made may be after
</p>
<p>wards repaired. If the Union is once severed, the line of sep
</p>
<p>aration will grow wider, and the controversies that are now
</p>
<p>debated and settled in the halls of legislation, will be tried on
</p>
<p>fields of battle, and determined by the sword. Neither should
</p>
<p>you deceive yourselves with the hope that the line of separa
</p>
<p>tion would be the permanent one, and that nothing but har
</p>
<p>mony and concord would be found in the new associations
</p>
<p>formed on the disolution of the Union."
</p>
<p>These solemn warnings Jackson left to the nation, just be
</p>
<p>fore quitting office and returning to his home to die.
</p>
<p>The storm created by the slave power during Jackson's Ad
</p>
<p>ministration, had become lulled to a calm. Arkansas and
</p>
<p>Michigan had both been admitted into the Union during his
</p>
<p>term of office. No slave territory now remained to be formed
</p>
<p>into slave states except Florida.
</p>
<p>Martin Van Buren was inaugurated President on the 4th
</p>
<p>df March, 1837, and during his term of office nothing very ex
</p>
<p>citing took place concerning slavery. Its friends were evi
</p>
<p>dently recruiting from the Waterloo defeat given them by
</p>
<p>Jackson, but had not yet determined on the mode of another
</p>
<p>attack. In 1839, the Hon. Wm. Slade of Vermont, a member of the
</p>
<p>Lower House of Congress, presented petitions from his con
</p>
<p>stituents, praying for the abolition of slavery in the District
</p>
<p>of Columbia. This brought down the ire of several Southern
</p>
<p>members. Among them, Wise of Virginia, endeavored to

</p>
<p>TRAITORS IN CONGRESS. 31
</p>
<p>alleging that he was out of order. Finally, after repeated ef
</p>
<p>forts, a vote was carried to adjourn, sixty-three members vot
</p>
<p>ing against it. Here, Mr. Campbell of South Carolina, jumped
</p>
<p>on a chair, and requested all members from slave holding
</p>
<p>states to go at once into the District Committee Room, where
</p>
<p>a meeting was being organized.
</p>
<p>Rhett of South Carolina, wrote to the Charleston Mercury,
</p>
<p>declaring that the Constitution had failed to protect the South
</p>
<p>in her rights, and advised a dissolution of the Union, and pro
</p>
<p>posed that two persons from each slave state should meet and
</p>
<p>report on the best means peaceably to dissolve the Union.
</p>
<p>Although six years had Hardly passed away since the nullifi
</p>
<p>cation defeat, another attempt was now made on a larger scale.
</p>
<p>Mr. Patter of Virginia, became the pacifier in this contro
</p>
<p>versy, and the ire of South Carolina simmered down.
</p>
<p>The threatened dissolution of the Union on the line of
</p>
<p>slavery, made so soon after the defeat of the effort of South
</p>
<p>Carolina, convinced the thinking men of all parties at the
</p>
<p>North that nullification was not dead, but sleepeth.
</p>
<p>About this time, 1838-9, Mr. Clay made a speech in the
</p>
<p>Senate against agitating the slavery question. His very
</p>
<p>speech was agitation, for he could not help but know that any
</p>
<p>kind of agitation was death to slavery. To speak in its favor
</p>
<p>is an insult to a savage, and much more to a civilized man,
</p>
<p>who weighs the actions of men and governments in the scale
</p>
<p>of justice. To speak against it, drags the hideous outlaw and
</p>
<p>criminal from his dark abode into tbe light,twho, to be hated,
</p>
<p>needs only to be seen. It was in that speech Clay made his
</p>
<p>famous attack on Daniel O'Connell, the Irish liberator. The
</p>
<p>latter had made some remarks against slavery in the British
</p>
<p>House of Commons. Mr. Clay, referring to that, remarked :
</p>
<p>" that he regarded his speech as the ravings of a plunderer of
</p>
<p>his own country, and the vilifier of a foreign and kindred
</p>
<p>people." Tne political horizon about this time looked rather hazy,
</p>
<p>although there was no appearance of an immediate storm.

<p>The politicians were now beginning to urge the claims of party
</p>
<p>32 DESPERATE SCHEMES OF
</p>
<p>favorites whom they wish to become presidential candidates.
</p>
<p>Two financial crises had occurred  one at the commence
</p>
<p>ment, the other at the close of Mr. Van Buren's administra
</p>
<p>tion. The banks in the different States had become so crip
</p>
<p>pled by the crisis, that they joined the friends of the United
</p>
<p>States Bank, and both charged Mr. Van Buren and the Demo
</p>
<p>cratic party, with being the authors of all the financial distress.
</p>
<p>The Democrats re-nominated Martin Van Buren, with Rich
</p>
<p>ard Mv Johnston as Vice President, for a second term ; while
</p>
<p>the Whigs re-nominated their old candidates who ran in 1836,
</p>
<p>William Henry Harrison, of Ohio, and John Tyler, of Vir
</p>
<p>ginia, for Vice President. Thus trie presidential aspirants
</p>
<p>for the election of 1840 were brought into the field.
</p>
<p>The banks, as before stated, made common cause with the
</p>
<p>Whig party, and gave their undivided support to secure the
</p>
<p>election of Harrison and Tyler. Financial ruin was every
</p>
<p>where evident ; the political element was charged with na
</p>
<p>tional discontent ; the people themselves had resolved upon
</p>
<p>a change. Add to this state of things, the millions of money
</p>
<p>thrown into the canvass by the discontented banks  it made this
</p>
<p>the most exciting election ever witnessed. When the campaign

<p>advancing to battle ; add to this their hideous yell, accompanied
</p>
<p>with the ring of the anvil and sound of the flail, the sweet

</p>
<p>joining in the loud chorus 
</p>
<p>" We'll just take a cup of hard cider,
</p>
<p>And drink to old Tippecanoe."
</p>
<p>Never was there such a popular uprising of the people. At
</p>
<p>Dayton, Ohio, a convention was held one month before the
</p>
<p>presidential election. The old hero of Tippecanoe was there.
</p>
<p>The crowd, measured by the acre, by competent engineers,
</p>
<p>showed one hundred thousand people. A flag-pole and flag
</p>
<p>on top of a house was the sign for free lunch within. Eight
</p>
<p>hundred poles of that kind were counted. Men. of all ages
</p>
<p>and conditions in life mingled together as brethren in a com
</p>
<p>mon cause. Old grandmothers, with tottering steps, sup
</p>
<p>ported by buckeye canes ; women with children in their arms ;
</p>
<p>young misses and boys jostling about as the great crowd
</p>
<p>swayed to and fro.
</p>
<p>The election over, Harrison got two hundred and thirty-
</p>
<p>four electoral votes. Van Buren only sixty.
</p>
<p>Thus ended one of the greatest political excitements, termi
</p>
<p>nating peacefully, that ever occurred in any country. The
</p>
<p>people had triumphed in electiug a man of their choice.
</p>
<p>The day of political intrigue was now inaugurated. In
</p>
<p>1838, during Van Buren's administration, Mr. Preston, of
</p>
<p>South Carolina, had proposed the annexation of Texas. In
</p>
<p>his speech on that occasion he remarked : " The treaty, Mr.
</p>
<p>President, of 1319 was a great oversight on the part of the
</p>
<p>Southern States. We went into it blindly. I must say the
</p>
<p>great importance of Florida, to which the public mind was

<p>strongly awakened at that time, by peculiar circumstances,
</p>
<p>34 DESPERATE SCHEMES OF
</p>
<p>led us precipitately into a measure by which we threw away
</p>
<p>a gem that would have bought ten Floridas."
</p>
<p>Another remark in Mr. Preston's speech is worthy of no
</p>
<p>tice. Speaking of the boundary of 1819, he said, " It places
</p>
<p>a foreign nation on the rear of our Mississippi settlements,
</p>
<p>and brings it within a stone's throw of the great outlet which
</p>
<p>discharges the commerce of the Union."
</p>
<p>Although Mr. Van Buren and the slave power had made
</p>
<p>' friends, and South Carolina gave him the first electoral vote
</p>
<p>she had given to any President for twelve years, although
</p>
<p>there was strong evidence of an understanding, neither Mr.
</p>
<p>Preston's speech, nor the strong arm of Executive will, could
</p>
<p>convince the Senate that while Texas was at war with Mex
</p>
<p>ico the proper time for annexation had come. By annexing,
</p>
<p>Texas, we annexed war. And a motion to lay the proposition
</p>
<p>on the table prevailed by a vote of 24 to 14.
</p>
<p>The annexation of Texas now became the great scheme of
</p>
<p>the slave power. Originating as it did in South Carolina, it
</p>
<p>came into the national councils with the smell of treason. Be
</p>
<p>tween 1820 and 1830 nearly three hundred families from
</p>
<p>the various slave States, mostly from Louisiana, had received
</p>
<p>permission from Spain, while Spanish authority was still
</p>
<p>maintained in Mexico, to settle in that fertile region, under
</p>
<p>the express condition that they shpuld submit to the laws of
</p>
<p>the country. In the meantime Mexico separated from Spain,
</p>
<p>and immediately passed laws abolishing slavery in her domin
</p>
<p>ions, and also prohibiting it in all future time. This the new
</p>
<p>settlers in Texas did not relish. Backed up by the slave
</p>
<p>power of the Southern States, a great number of lawless
</p>
<p>adventurers from the border slave States went over into
</p>
<p>Texas, hatched a conspiracy, and organized rebellion against
</p>
<p>Mexico, and, with a population of less than twenty thousand,
</p>
<p>declared themselves free. Thus war between Texas and
</p>
<p>Mexico was commenced.

</p>
<p>power demanded more room. The General Government had
</p>
<p>no territory except that in which slavery was prohibited by
</p>
<p>positive enactment. By surveying the situation, the slave
</p>
<p>holders and nullifiers of South Carolina discovered Texas.
</p>
<p>Thus Mr. Preston's effort, under Van Buren's Administration,
</p>
<p>to annex ; also, his remarks about a foreign nation being placed
</p>
<p>in the rear of our Mississippi settlement, had a double mean
</p>
<p>ing : first, they were foreign because it belonged to Mexico ;
</p>
<p>second, it was foreign to the Mississippi settlement because
</p>
<p>they were slave, and Mexico had declared Texas free.
</p>
<p>Thus the greedy slave power, with an appetite not to be ap
</p>
<p>peased, stood watching its chosen victim with the one absorb
</p>
<p>ing thought  how can I secure it. It was at this interesting
</p>
<p>moment that General Harrison came to Washington to assume
</p>
<p>his duties as Chief Magistrate of the nation. Although born
</p>
<p>in a slave state, still, like Jefferson, he was opposed to slavery.
</p>
<p>As soon as he got cleverly warm in his seat, he was visited
</p>
<p>by J. C. Calhoun of South Carolina, Messrs. Gilmore and Up
</p>
<p>shur of Virginia, and two others, whose names we have forgot
</p>
<p>ten. These five men had the interest of slavery committed to
</p>
<p>their care, and the object of their visit to the President was
</p>
<p>to ascertain his views about annexing Texas. This interview
</p>
<p>took place in the President's reception room. After passing
</p>
<p>the usual compliments of the day, Calhoun became the spokes
</p>
<p>man. He said :
</p>
<p>" General, the subject of annexation, I believe, like a mo
</p>
<p>tion to adjourn, is always in order. The object of our visit
</p>
<p>is to ascertain your views concerning the annexation of Texas."
</p>
<p>To which General Harrison made the following reply : that
</p>
<p>he had not given the subject that attention it deserved ; there
</p>
<p>fore he could not speak positively as to what policy he would
</p>
<p>pursue. But he could say this much  if Texas had her in
</p>
<p>dependence acknowledgd by Mexico, then, under certain con
</p>
<p>ditions, he would favor annexation.
</p>
<p>This was about all that passed on that subject at that in

<p>terview, and the Southern gentlemen retired. They did not
</p>
<p>even ask the General what these conditions were. He had
</p>
<p>36 DESPERATE SCHEMES OF
</p>
<p>said sufficient to satisfy them that he was not the man to carry
</p>
<p>out their plot, with such men as Webster and Ewing in his
</p>
<p>Cabinet. Their success was next to impossible. Then for
</p>
<p>the next best thing; They had staked all their hopes on get
</p>
<p>ting back Texas. The South was perishing for the want of
</p>
<p>more slave territory, and the defeat of Van Buren by Harri
</p>
<p>son was now about to prevent their success. They immediately
</p>
<p>went to see John Tyler at his own home in Virginia, and
</p>
<p>after explaining every thing to him, he agreed to the great
</p>
<p>necessity of securing Texas at once, and at all hazards ; but
</p>
<p>I am powerless, says Tyler. I will leave the management of the
</p>
<p>matter with3rou. If I should ever become President I would
</p>
<p>exert the entire influence of that office to accomplish the object.
</p>
<p>This wasjoyful news. They had found the right man, and
</p>
<p>only one thing was wanting' to get him in the right place.
</p>
<p>President Harrison was near seventy years old, and a little
</p>
<p>would suffice to put him aside. He had already lived to a
</p>
<p>good old age, and received many honors. " He can not, in the
</p>
<p>course of nature, live but a short time longer. He is sur
</p>
<p>rounded by a bad set of men who will do all they can to de
</p>
<p>feat our darling annexation scheme. We can not get rid of
</p>
<p>them without we first get rid of the old man himself. They
</p>
<p>determined rather than be defeated to murder the President."
</p>
<p>On the 17th of March the Chief Magistrate issued a Proc
</p>
<p>lamation convening Congress in extraordinary session for the
</p>
<p>31st of May ensuing. He was enjoying his usual good health.
</p>
<p>" Thus," says Mr. Benton, " President Harrison did not live to
</p>
<p>meet the Congress which he had thus convoked. Short as the
</p>
<p>time was that he had fixed for its meeting, his own time on
</p>
<p>earth was still shorter. In the last days of March he was
</p>
<p>taken ill. On the 4th day of April he was dead. There was
</p>
<p>no failure of health or strength to indicate such an event, or to
</p>
<p>excite apprehensions that he icould not go through his term with
</p>
<p>the vigor lie had commenced it. His attack was sudden and evi

<p>dently fatal from the commencement."  Benton's Thirty Years,

<p>Vol. II, 210.
</p>
<p>Mr. Benton evidently intended the above remarks to con-
</p>
<p>TRAITORS IN CONGRESS. 37
</p>
<p>vey to posterity that General Harrison did not die of natural
</p>
<p>disease  no failure of health or strength existed  but some
</p>
<p>thing sudden and fatal. He did not die of Apoplexy ; that
</p>
<p>is a disease. But arsenic would produce a sudden effect, and
</p>
<p>it would also be fatal from the commencement. This is the
</p>
<p>chief weapon of the medical assassin. Oxalic acid, prucic
</p>
<p>acid, or salts of strychnine, would be almost instant death, and
</p>
<p>would give but little advantage for escape to the murderer.
</p>
<p>Therefore his was not a case of acute poisoning, when death
</p>
<p>takes place almost instantaneously, but of chronic, where the
</p>
<p>patient dies slowly. He lived about six days after he re
</p>
<p>ceived the drug.
</p>
<p>By referring to the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal,
</p>
<p>Vol. XXV, 1841, it will be seen, that his case was at first con
</p>
<p>sidered complicated Pneumonia, but terminated in gastro in
</p>
<p>testinal irritation or inflammation, resulting in death in a little
</p>
<p>over four days from the time of the attack. The circum
</p>
<p>stances which surrounded the illness of President Harrison
</p>
<p>were such as to preclude all apprehensions of his physicians
</p>
<p>of any but natural causes for his sickness ; yet let us con
</p>
<p>sider how similar are the symptoms of certain poisons, and
</p>
<p>the causes of natural disease, or disease from poisons that
</p>
<p>the best physicians maj' commit an error in their diagnosis,
</p>
<p>and not only fail to suspect the existence of poisons, but
</p>
<p>even prescribe and administer the established remedies,
</p>
<p>which only augment the difficulty, and, render the action of
</p>
<p>these poisons certainly fatal, as will be seen by referring to
</p>
<p>Taylor on Poisons, page 107 : " To the practitioner the diag
</p>
<p>nosis of a case of poisoning is of great importance, as by
</p>
<p>mistaking the symptoms produced by a poison for those aris
</p>
<p>ing from natural disease, he "may omit to employ the reme
</p>
<p>dial measures which have been found efficacious in counter
</p>
<p>acting its effects, and thus lead to the certain death of a patient."
</p>
<p>Again, the same author, on the same page, says that if poi
</p>
<p>sons are taken in large doses, and the person is in health,

</p>
<p>" the symptoms appear suddenly."
</p>
<p>Again, on the same page :
</p>
<p>38 DESPERATE SCHEMES OF
</p>
<p>" It is very true that these powerful agents, given at inter
</p>
<p>vals in small doses, do not cause those striking symptoms
</p>
<p>upon which a practitioner commonly relies as evidence of
</p>
<p>poisoning. They may then produce disorder, but of so slight
</p>
<p>a nature as scarcely to excite suspicion. In fact, under these
</p>
<p>circumstances, the symptoms often so closely resemble those
</p>
<p>of disease, that an experienced practitioner may be easily
</p>
<p>mistaken respecting their origin, especially when no circum
</p>
<p>stances exist to create the least suspicion of criminality on
</p>
<p>the part of relatives and others around the patient. Arsenic
</p>
<p>given in small doses, at long intervals, has thus occasioned
</p>
<p>symptoms resembling those which depend on chronic disease
</p>
<p>of the stomach. After repeated attacks and recoveries, sus
</p>
<p>picion may be completely disarmed. Among several cases of
</p>
<p>this kind which have been referred to me for investigation,
</p>
<p>was one in which it was alleged that a farmer, in one of the
</p>
<p>midland counties, had been poisoned two years before by his
</p>
<p>housekeeper, who was a respectable person, and most atten
</p>
<p>tive to him as a nurse during his illness. He had been at
</p>
<p>tacked at intervals with vomiting and other signs of disorder
</p>
<p>of the stomach about three months before his death, but re
</p>
<p>covered under medical treatment. About eight days before
</p>
<p>his death the symptoms recurred with greater violence than
</p>
<p>ever, and he sank under them. They were referred to ulcer
</p>
<p>ation of the stomach, so closely did they resemble those of
</p>
<p>disease. As there was no suspicion of poison, the body was
</p>
<p>not examined ; and nothing would have been known respect
</p>
<p>ing the real cause of death, but for a statement made two
</p>
<p>years afterwards, by the housekeeper, that she had on two
</p>
<p>occasions administered to her master small doses of arsenic,
</p>
<p>and the last, probably from its being larger than the first,
</p>
<p>had occasioned death. In the case of Reg. v. Wooler (Dur
</p>
<p>ham Winter Assizes, 1855), it was proved that the deceased
</p>
<p>had been laboring under symptoms of poisoning by arsenic,
</p>
<p>for a period of about six weeks before her death. The symp

</p>
<p>disease. It was, however, their continuance and their occa
</p>
<p>sional violent recurrence in spite of treatment, that induced a
</p>
<p>suspicion of poisoning, which was confirmed by a chemical
</p>
<p>examination of the urine, and subsequently of the body."
</p>
<p>From the foregoing quotations it will be seen how natural
</p>
<p>it was for any .physician to have been mistaken in the case ;
</p>
<p>and supposing this to be true, it is very evident that the rem
</p>
<p>edies used in the case, being what Dr. Taylor calls irritants,
</p>
<p>such as mercury and antimony, and capable of augmenting
</p>
<p>the difficulty and adding to a condition already established,
</p>
<p>the cause of which not being suspected could only be followed
</p>
<p>by the fatal -result. On page 109, the same author says :
</p>
<p>" A diseased state of the body may render a person compar
</p>
<p>atively unsusceptible of the actions of some poisons, while in
</p>
<p>other instances it may increase their action and render them
</p>
<p>fatal in small doses." Again, on the same page, he says : " In
</p>
<p>certain diseased states of the system, there is an increased
</p>
<p>susceptibility to the action of poison, or what is termed intol
</p>
<p>erance of certain drugs. Ordinary medicinal doses may in
</p>
<p>such cases exert a poisonous action. Thus, in persons who-
</p>
<p>have a tendency to apoplexy, a small dose of opium may act
</p>
<p>more quickly and prove fatal. In one laboring under inflam
</p>
<p>mation of the stomach or bowels, there would be an increased!
</p>
<p>susceptibility of the action of arsenic, or other irritants."
</p>
<p>Supposing the fatal agent used to have been arsenic,. the
</p>
<p>use of mercury and antimony in his case certainly wouldicome-
</p>
<p>under the last considerations, " irritants," and cause* au ihr-
</p>
<p>crease of the difficulty, and transfer the disease to the stomach
</p>
<p>and bowels. The whole class of symptoms of active diseases
</p>
<p>of the stomach and bowels, are closely allied to diseases pro
</p>
<p>duced by poisons of this class ; and in almost every instance
</p>
<p>may be mistaken, as quoted above, for natural diseases. Such
</p>
<p>was the fact in the case of General Harrison ; and under
</p>
<p>circumstances that would entirely exempt his physicians
</p>
<p>from blame or censure for any failure in diagnosis, or the

</p>
<p>40 DESPERATE SCHEMES OF
</p>
<p>while they are never recommended when poisons of the same
</p>
<p>kind are already in the system. As this case changed so much
</p>
<p>from the beginning, it is almost certain that the irritants used
</p>
<p>in the case fully developed the effect of the arsenic which
</p>
<p>he had taken, and resulted as above stated.
</p>
<p>Dr. Taylor, on page 123, says : " The diseases, the symp
</p>
<p>toms of which resemble those produced by irritant poisons,
</p>
<p>are cholera, gastritis, enteritis, gastro-enteritis, peritonitis,
</p>
<p>perforation of the stomach or intestines, strangulated hernia,
</p>
<p>colic, and hsematemesis." He further adds, page 125 : " Gas
</p>
<p>tritis, Enteritis, Gastro-enteritis, Peritonitis.  These diseases
</p>
<p>do not commonly occur without some, obvious cause ; in
</p>
<p>deed, the two first, in the acute form, must be regarded as
</p>
<p>the direct results of irritant poisoning. Thus arsenic and other
</p>
<p>irritants, when they prove fatal, commonly give rise to inflam
</p>
<p>mation of the stomach and bowels. In all cases in which these
</p>
<p>diseases present themselves, the object of a practitioner is, there
</p>
<p>fore, to determine the cause of the inflammation, whether it be
</p>
<p>due to natural disease, or the action of an irritant poison."
</p>
<p>With these facts, and the quoted authority, can any one
</p>
<p>doubt that General Harrison was poisoned, and also that his
</p>
<p>physicians overlooked the true nature of the malady. The
</p>
<p>attending physicians, Drs. May and Miller, supposed he
</p>
<p>died of billious pleurisy. His death occurred at half past
</p>
<p>12 o'clock at night, Saturday, April 3d, 1841. About noon it
</p>
<p>was supposed he was getting better, but at 3 o'clock the symp
</p>
<p>toms became more violent, and at sundown his entire Cabinet
</p>
<p>Officers were informed that the symptoms were such that it
</p>
<p>was evident he must die.
</p>
<p>All this time John Tyler was absent, at home on his farm in
</p>
<p>Virginia. Fletcher Webster, Chief Clerk in the State De
</p>
<p>partment, was immediately dispatched to Virginia, to inform
</p>
<p>Tyler of the event ; and on th 4th, the following official an

<p>April, A. D., 1841, at thirty minutes before 1 o'clock in the
</p>
<p>morning. The people of the United States, overwhelmed,
</p>
<p>like ourselves, by an event so unexpected, and so melancholy,
</p>
<p>will derive consolation from knowing that bis death was calm
</p>
<p>and resigned, as his life has been patriotic, useful, and dis
</p>
<p>tinguished ; and that the last utterance of his lips expressed
</p>
<p>a fervent desire for the. perpetuity of the Constitution and
</p>
<p>the preservation of its true principles. In death, as well as in
</p>
<p>life, the happiness of his country was uppermost in his thoughts.

</p>
<p>On the 9th of April, Tyler issued an address to the people.
</p>
<p>Among other things, he said : " That for the first time in our
</p>
<p>history, the person elected to the Vice Presidency of the
</p>
<p>United States, by the happening of a contingency provided in
</p>
<p>the Constitution, has had devolved upon him the Presidential
</p>
<p>pffice." (He must have felt keenly the sense of guilt that he
</p>
<p>deserved, and would receive the reproach of his countrymen
</p>
<p>when he penned the following sentence.) The spirit of faction,
</p>
<p>which is directly opposed to the spirit of lofty patriotism, may
</p>
<p>find it the occasion for assaults upon, my Administration."
</p>
<p>Thomas Benton remarks : " Little did he think when he
</p>
<p>wrote the above sentence, that within three short months,
</p>
<p>within less time than a Commercial Bill of Exchange has to
</p>
<p>run, the great party which had elected him, and the Cabinet
</p>
<p>Officers should be united in that assault, and should lead the

<p>van of public outcry against him."
</p>
<p>42 DESPERATE SCHEMES OF
</p>
<p>Betraying and deceiving friends, formed the leading traits
</p>
<p>of his character. By this course he became extremely unpopu
</p>
<p>lar. The number of Cabinent Officers appointed by Presi
</p>
<p>dents holding only one term, run thus : John Adams, 12 ;
</p>
<p>John Quincey Adams 7 ; Van Buren 10 ; Polk 9 ; Fillmore
</p>
<p>11 ; Pierce 7 : Buchanan 8 ; John Tyler 21. This outnum
</p>
<p>bered any of the two-term Presidents. Jackson, during the
</p>
<p>stormy times of both his Administrations, only had 19. If Ty
</p>
<p>ler had served two terms at the same ratio, he would have
</p>
<p>had 42.
</p>
<p>Thus ends the account of the campaign and election ; also
</p>
<p>of the mysterious and sudden death of President Harrison.
</p>
<p>We now propose to show more fully the motives that induced
</p>
<p>his murder, by following up the assassins in the future devel
</p>
<p>opment of their plot.
</p>
<p>We mentioned in the preceding pages that five Southern
</p>
<p>men had visited the President shortly after he took his seat.
</p>
<p>We gave the names of three  Calhoun, Gilmore and Upshur
</p>
<p> the latter two from Virginia. There were two others in
</p>
<p>company, but their names have slipped our memory. These
</p>
<p>gentlemen, after having the conversation with President Har
</p>
<p>rison, went directly to Richmond, Va., and from there to the
</p>
<p>Vice President John Tyler's house. They there addressed
</p>
<p>him, as a Southern man, and wanted to get his views on the
</p>
<p>annexation of Texas. We do not pretend to give the precise
</p>
<p>words of their two days' entertainment ; only to demonstrate
</p>
<p>to the world that political intrigue and secret assassination
</p>
<p>were unanimously agreed upon, and afterwards successfully
</p>
<p>carried out.
</p>
<p>Harrison was to be secretly put out of the way, so that John
</p>
<p>Tyler would become the Constitutional President. To reward
</p>
<p>those who dyed their hands in his innocent blood, Tyler sol
</p>
<p>emnly agreed to betray the party that elected him, and for
</p>
<p>ever turn his back on its men and its measures ; and call, as
</p>
<p>his Cabinet advisers, the identical men who, by foul murder,

</p>
<p>had placed him in the Presidential Chair. It was not the
</p>
<p>traitors in congress. 43
</p>
<p>Democratic Party that Tyler had made an alliance with, but
</p>
<p>it was with the milliners and secessionists ; men who, in the
</p>
<p>interests of slavery, had secretly sworn to devote their whole
</p>
<p>lives to accomplish the destruction of the Federal Union.
</p>
<p>The Whig Party very soon discovered that Tyler had turned
</p>
<p>his back on its policy; and on the 11th day of September,
</p>
<p>1841, Senator Dixon of Rhode Island, and Jeremiah Morrow
</p>
<p>of Ohio, both venerable with age, were appointed Presidents
</p>
<p>of a meeting held by the Whig Members of Congress. They
</p>
<p>issued what they termed a manifesto, renouncing said John
</p>
<p>Tyler. We copy the following :
</p>
<p>" That he might be able to divert the policy of his Admin
</p>
<p>istration into a channel which should lead to new political
</p>
<p>combinations, and accomplish results which must overthrow
</p>
<p>the present division of parties in the country, and finally pro
</p>
<p>duce a state of things which those who elected him, at least,
</p>
<p>never contemplated."  Again : "He has violently separated him
</p>
<p>self from those by whose exertions and suffrages he was elected
</p>
<p>to that office, through which he reached his present exalted
</p>
<p>situation. The existence of this unnatural relation is as extra
</p>
<p>ordinary as the announcement of it is painful and mortifying."
</p>
<p>On the same day of the manifesto, his Cabinet officers, all
</p>
<p>except Webster, resigned. He waited a short time to en
</p>
<p>deavor to effect a union of the Whig Party, by which he said
</p>
<p>he meant the Whig President, Whig Congress, and whig Peo
</p>
<p>ple. But Mr. Webster's stay was short.
</p>
<p>This was what Tyler had been wishing for weeks  we
</p>
<p>mean the breaking up of the Cabinet. It gave him a chance
</p>
<p>to form a new one. He feels his way carefully, and only at
</p>
<p>the first selection brings in two of the secret cabal, as Henry
</p>
<p>Clay termed it  Alexander P. Upshur and Thomas W. Gil-
</p>
<p>more, Virginians. Both of these men had visited him at his
</p>
<p>house in Virginia, before General Harrison was poisoned.
</p>
<p>Thus Tyler was fulfilling his part of the contract with fidelity.

<p>retary of State, had to be removed. Abruptness would have
</p>
<p>carried suspicion. Therefore, says Mr. Benton, a middle
</p>
<p>44 DESPERATE SCHEMES OF
</p>
<p>course was adopted, the same which had been practiced
</p>
<p>with others in 1841  that of compelling a resignation. Mr.
</p>
<p>Tyler became reserved and indifferent to him. Mr. Gilmore
</p>
<p>and Mr. Upshur, with whom he had few affinities, took but little
</p>
<p>pains to conceal their distaste for him. It was evident to him,
</p>
<p>when the Cabinet met, that he was one too many. Reserve
</p>
<p>and distrust were visible both in the President and the Vir
</p>
<p>ginia part of his Cabinet. Mr. Webster felt it, and mentioned
</p>
<p>it to some of his friends. They advised him to resign. He
</p>
<p>did so, and the resignation was accepted with alacrity, which
</p>
<p>showed it was waited for. Mr. Upshur took his place, and
</p>
<p>quickly the Texas negotiation became official, though still
</p>
<p>private ; and in the appointment and immediate opening of
</p>
<p>Texas negotiation stood confessed the true reason for getting
</p>
<p>rid of Mr. Webster.  2d vol. Benton, 30 yrs. pp. 562.
</p>
<p>As we before stated, the object of the conspiracy, which
</p>
<p>terminated in the murder of President Harrison, was to se
</p>
<p>cure the annexation of Texas as an outlet for slavery. The
</p>
<p>crime they had committed was so horrible, that the revenge
</p>
<p>of Almighty God soon overtook them. Oh the 28th of Feb
</p>
<p>ruary, 1844, a very large gun on board of the Princeton was
</p>
<p>to be fired as an experiment. Many persons went on board to
</p>
<p>witness it, among whom were the two Cabinet officers, Mr. Gil-
</p>
<p>more and Mr. Upshur. The vessel had proceeded down the
</p>
<p>Potomac below the Tomb of Washington, and at 4 o'clock
</p>
<p>in the evening, when returning, it was determined to fire the
</p>
<p>gun once more. Lieutenant Hunt having charge, the guests
</p>
<p>were feasting at the table, when the word came that the gun
</p>
<p>was to be fired again. They all rushed out to see. President
</p>
<p>Tyler also being on board, was called back by some one, while
</p>
<p>his Cabinet favorites walked, as it were, right into the jaws
</p>
<p>of death. The great gun exploded, killing only five persons
</p>
<p>out of the great number. Among the five were Gilmore and
</p>
<p>Upshur. Tyler was saved from the same fate by being called
</p>
<p>back to the other end of the vessel. Kennon, Marcey, and

</p>
<p>Sufficient of God's displeasure, one would suppose, had been
</p>
<p>witnessed to induce this bad man to stop. But no ; the very
</p>
<p>prince of NuUifiers, the deadly foe of the National Govern
</p>
<p>ment and peace of the country  the sworn enemy of Free
</p>
<p>dom, and champion of Slavery  the secret mover of the at
</p>
<p>tempted assassination of President Jackson, and poisoning of
</p>
<p>President Harrison  John C. Calhoun, was chosen Secretary
</p>
<p>of State, and John Y. Mason of Virginia, Secretary of the Navy !
</p>
<p>Tyler's Cabinet was now gathered entirely from the slave
</p>
<p>States, except William Wilkins of Pennsylvania. He had
</p>
<p>what the South called a reliable Cabinet ; one that would go
</p>
<p>all lengths, and stop at nothing, to execute swiftly the will of
</p>
<p>the slave power.
</p>
<p>The ultimate object of the plot, of which the poisoning of
</p>
<p>General Harrison only served as a means to carry out, re
</p>
<p>mained yet to be accomplished. The scheme was hatched
</p>
<p>in South Carolina during Van Buren's term of office ; and was
</p>
<p>the idea of getting more slave territory, through the annexa
</p>
<p>tion of Texas. These bad men now pursued that object with
</p>
<p>a step as sure as time. A meeting was called in May, 1844,
</p>
<p>at Ashby, Barnwell district, South Carolina. The following
</p>
<p>is a part of the fourth resolution passed at that meeting :
</p>
<p>" That the alternative be presented to the free States, either
</p>
<p>to admit Texas into the Union, or to peaceably and calmly ar
</p>
<p>range the terms of a dissolution of the Union.".
</p>
<p>At another meeting, at Beaufort, same State, and about the
</p>
<p>same time, one of the resolutions was as follows : " If Texas
</p>
<p>is not annexed, we solemnly announce to the world, that we
</p>
<p>will dissolve this Union sooner than abandon Texas.
</p>
<p>In the Williamsburg district, same State, another meeting
</p>
<p>was held. One resolution says : " We hold it to be better,
</p>
<p>and more to the interest of the South and southern portion of
</p>
<p>this Confederacy, to be out of the Union with Texas, than in
</p>
<p>it without her."

<p>sition of the slaveholders of South Carolina. " Texas, or dis
</p>
<p>union I" was the cry. The slave power had, by the foul deed
</p>
<p>46 DESPERATE SCHEMES OF
</p>
<p>of murder, got control of the National Government ; a slave-
</p>
<p>holding President ; a slaveholding Cabinet, except one. It
</p>
<p>only remained for South Carolina, by threats of disunion, to
</p>
<p>control Congress. Thus the bill to annex Texas to the Union,
</p>
<p>while she was still at war with Mexico, was forced upon Con
</p>
<p>gress by the slave power. The bill passed the House by 23
</p>
<p>majority, but would have been defeated in the Senate if it
</p>
<p>had not been for the treachery of Calhoun and John Tyler.
</p>
<p>Five votes were secured by fraud.
</p>
<p>Thus speaks Mr. Benton, (who was himself in favor of an
</p>
<p>nexation, but not by fraud :) " He, the then Secretary of State,
</p>
<p>the present Senator from South Carolina, to whom I address
</p>
<p>myself, did it on Sunday, the second day of March ; that day
</p>
<p>which preceded the last day of his authority ; and on that day,
</p>
<p>sacred to peace, the Council sat that acted on the resolution ;
</p>
<p>and in the darkness of a night howling with storm and bat
</p>
<p>tling with the elements, as if heaven frowned on the audacious
</p>
<p>act, the fatal messenger was sent off who carried the selected
</p>
<p>resolutions to Texas. The exit of the Secretary from office,
</p>
<p>and the start of the messenger from Washington should be
</p>
<p>remembered together."
</p>
<p>Texas was admitted, and all the consequences of admission
</p>
<p>were incurred : war  the state of war  was established. With
</p>
<p>force did Benton remark, " As Helen was the cause of the
</p>
<p>Trojan, a.nd Antony the cause of the Roman civil war, and
</p>
<p>Lord North made the war of the Revolution, just so certainly
</p>
<p>is John C. Calhoun the author of the present war between
</p>
<p>the United States and Mexico."
</p>
<p>What could be expected of an Administration that secured
</p>
<p>its power by foul treachery and secret murder. Tyler betrays
</p>
<p>the party who elected him. Having dyed his hands in inno
</p>
<p>cent blood, he could not bear the company of the dead man's
</p>
<p>friends ; even the principles that his victim had labored so
</p>
<p>many long years to carry out, he threw aside and tram
</p>
<p>pled with disdain under his unholy and blood-stained feet.

<p>The annals of the world might be searched in vain for such a-
</p>
<p>villain. The man on whose popularity he had been exalted

<p>TRAITORS IN CONGRESS. 47
</p>
<p>to high position, he reached up to, and stabbed. Well might
</p>
<p>Henry Clay say, speaking of Tyler : " That he contemplated
</p>
<p>the death of General Harrison with mingled emotions of grief,
</p>
<p>of patriotism, and gratitude  above all, of gratitude !"
</p>
<p>He betrayed his party and country, and at last human na
</p>
<p>ture  by practising a cheat on a mighty nation, bringing on a
</p>
<p>useless and bloody war, for the sole and only purpose of ex
</p>
<p>tending human slavery.
</p>
<p>War existed between the United States and Mexico,
</p>
<p>brought about by the foul administration of- John Tyler, in an
</p>
<p>nexing Texas. Hensy Clay and Theodore Frelinghuysen,"
</p>
<p>in favor of a protective Tariff, were the Whig candidates ;
</p>
<p>and James K. Polk and George M. Dallas were the Demo
</p>
<p>cratic, and successful candidates. They went in favor of the
</p>
<p>annexation of Texas, and recei.ved 170 electoral votes, while
</p>
<p>Mr. Clay got 105. Eight slave States gave their electoral .
</p>
<p>votes to Polk, and five in favor of Mr. Clay.
</p>
<p>James K. Polk, the newly elected President, came to Wash
</p>
<p>ington and took his seat on the 4th of March, 1845. The
</p>
<p>chief business of his administration was to recognize the war,
</p>
<p>and prosecute it with vigor to a successful termination. Al
</p>
<p>though originating and existing in the preceding administra
</p>
<p>tion, it was not declared by act of Congress until the 13th of
</p>
<p>May, 1846. And it was not until the beginning of February,
</p>
<p>1848, that it was brought to a close.
</p>
<p>The terms of the treaty of peace, as made by Mr. Trist,
</p>
<p>the plenipotentiary of the United States, with the Mexican
</p>
<p>Government, included New Mexico and Upper California,
</p>
<p>with the Lower Rio Grande, from its mouth to El Paso, taken
</p>
<p>as the boundary of Texas. These were the acquisitions, for
</p>
<p>which the United States agreed to pay to Mexico fifteen mil
</p>
<p>lions of dollars, in five instalments, annually after the first.
</p>
<p>The claims of American citizens against Mexico were to be
</p>
<p>assumed by the United States, limited to three and a quarter
</p>
<p>millions of dollars.* Thus terminated the war with Mexico,

<p>* The use of this money laid the foundation of the once vast fortune of Cor

<p>48 DESPERATE SCHEMES OF
</p>
<p>the great outlay of treasure by the General Government, with
</p>
<p>the immense loss of life, including many of its best citizens.
</p>
<p>Eighteen millions and a quarter was no small sum. Jeffer
</p>
<p>son only paid fifteen millions for Louisiana ; and all the fore
</p>
<p>going territory could have been acquired from Mexico in
</p>
<p>treating her respectfully for boundaries for even less than
</p>
<p>fifteen millions. Add to that the expense of a two year's war,
</p>
<p>and altogether it amounts to over $200,000,000.
</p>
<p>Thus ended the annexation scheme. As it was hatched
</p>
<p>to get more slave territory, commenced by individual assas
</p>
<p>sination, and ending in war, it was pursued from the begin
</p>
<p>ning with a villainy which crime alone can excite.
</p>
<p>We must now take a view of the situation of parties. The
</p>
<p>slave and free States were now equal in number, and it was
</p>
<p>impossible to get one lone State admitted, as that would give
</p>
<p>a majority to one or other of the parties ; but by coupling
</p>
<p>two together, which had previously been done with Arkansas
</p>
<p>and Michigan, when one was slave and the other free,
</p>
<p>they went in with a " rush." This worked so well before,
</p>
<p>that it was thought that, like bears in couples agree, Florida
</p>
<p>and Iowa would make a good pair, since they represented the
</p>
<p>two great principles of state. If they had been both black,
</p>
<p>or unfortunately both white, all would have been in vain.
</p>
<p>But when these was one of each color, they were admitted
</p>
<p>out of kindness, as lovers together. By this double process
</p>
<p>it kept the slave and free States always equal in number :
</p>
<p>but the annexation of Texas had brought in a large amount
</p>
<p>of new territory. The slave power now began to get uneasy,
</p>
<p>fearing, legislatively, that it would not be able to run slavery
</p>
<p>into it. It was power that was needed. Like the bachelor
</p>
<p>who married a widow who had already buried five husbands,
</p>
<p>when they were about to retire to bed the first night, Mr.
</p>
<p>Shuttlecock (for that was his name) remarked, " My dear, I
</p>
<p>have always made it a rule in life, just before retiring to
</p>
<p>bed, to return thanks to the Giver of all good." " Oh ! how

</p>
<p>mind of my first love ; Mr. Rogers, my first husband, always
</p>
<p>did thi3." Both kneeling by the bedside, Mr. Shuttlecock
</p>
<p>commenced, " 0, Lord, I adore thee to-night in a new capac
</p>
<p>ity ; I need now thine assistance more than ever before ; please
</p>
<p>guide and direct  " " Stop, stop 1 my dear," cries his ex
</p>
<p>perienced bride, tapping him on the shoulder, " I can do that ;
</p>
<p>pray for strength ; strength is what you need most." It was
</p>
<p>strength, although of a different kind, that the slave power
</p>
<p>wanted. The question with Calhoun was, where to get power to put
</p>
<p>slavery into the new territories.. It was claimed that they
</p>
<p>were free under Mexico, and came into the Federal Govern
</p>
<p>ment free. But Calhoun, needing strength, claimed that the
</p>
<p>American Constitution overrode and annulled all laws of
</p>
<p>Mexico inconsistent with it. " Grant that," said his oppo
</p>
<p>nents, " but where is the authority in the Federal Constitu
</p>
<p>tion to carry slavery anywhere ?"
</p>
<p>Mr. Wilmot, of Pennsylvania, now stepped in and intro
</p>
<p>duced what has since gone by the name of the Wilmot Pro
</p>
<p>viso : " That no part cf tlie territory to be acquired should be
</p>
<p>open to the introduction qf slavery."
</p>
<p>Thus commenced the agitation, on the power of Congress
</p>
<p>to legisla,te about slaver}7. It was claimed that slavery had
</p>
<p>rights above Congress, and above the Federal Constitution
</p>
<p>also. The excitement on this vexed question began to spread,
</p>
<p>and the slave power again began to rally its forces. The term
</p>
<p>of President Polk was about drawing to a close, and it was
</p>
<p>doubtful whether slavery could be carried into New Mexico
</p>
<p>or California. The Southern members began to hold nightly
</p>
<p>meetings in Washington, the result of which was a kind of
</p>
<p>Southern declaration of independence, setting forth that
</p>
<p>" Their grievances were greater against the United States
</p>
<p>Government than our ancestors' were against Great Britain."
</p>
<p>It was not only claimed, in this new declaration of independ
</p>
<p>ence, that slavery was to be prohibited in part of the newly
</p>

</p>
<p>The presidential election now began to take up the attention
</p>
<p>of all. The Democratic party had nominated, at Baltimore,
</p>
<p>Lewis Cass, of Michigan, for President, and Wm. 0. Butler,

<p>of Kentucky, as Vice President. This was in. May, 1848.

<p>TRAITORS IN CONGRESS. 51
</p>
<p>President Polk's administration, ended with a new threat to
</p>
<p>dissolve the Union, the old Bug-a-boo of the slave power. Af
</p>
<p>ter getting Texas, they now wished to dissolve Polk, like
</p>
<p>Jackson, loved the Union, and never countenanced anything
</p>
<p>in his administration that threatened its overthrow. He was
</p>
<p>exemplary in private life, and in public, only aimed at the good
</p>
<p>of his country.
</p>
<p>At every Presidential election the contest with the slave
</p>
<p>power became more bitter. Like the miser, its greed in
</p>
<p>creased with its gain ; getting much, it demanded more.
</p>
<p>Eight years before, it had dyed its hands in the blood of the
</p>
<p>lamented Harrison, and saturated its garments on the gory
</p>
<p>fields of Buena Vista, Palo Alto and Monterey. Besting yet
</p>
<p>restless through President Polk's administration, it now re
</p>
<p>appears with all its accumulated pomp, and like the Roman
</p>
<p>oxen, ribboned and garlanded for the sacrifice.
</p>
<p>President Taylor surveyed the situation, and suggested
</p>
<p>proper remedies to defeat the blood-thirsty foe of the Federal
</p>
<p>Union. About his first official act was to suppress the Cuban
</p>
<p>invasion, a darling scheme of the slaveholders to secure that
</p>
<p>Island at the hazard of a war with Spain. After President
</p>
<p>Taylor had written his first and only annual message, Calhoun,
</p>
<p>mortified at the defeat of the Cuban expedition, made a visit
</p>
<p>to the Department of State, and requested the President to
</p>
<p>say nothing in his forthcoming message about the. Union.
</p>
<p>But this bad man had little influence over old " Rough and
</p>
<p>Ready," for after his visit the following remarkable passage was
</p>
<p>added : " But attachment to the Union of the States should
</p>
<p>be habitually fostered in every American heart. For more than
</p>
<p>half a century, during* which kingdoms and empires have
</p>
<p>fallen, this Union has stood unshaken. The patriots who
</p>
<p>formed it have long since descended to the grave, yet still it
</p>
<p>remains, the proudest monument of their memory, and the
</p>
<p>object of affection and admiration of every one worthy to
</p>
<p>bear the American name. In my judgment its dissolution

</p>
<p>would be the greatest of calamities ; and to avert that should
</p>
<p>be the steady aim of every American. Upon its preserva-

<p>tion must depend our own happiness, and that of countless
</p>
<p>generations to come. Whatever dangers may threaten it, 2"
</p>
<p>\ shall stand by it, and maintain it in its integrity to the full'ex-
</p>
<p>' tent of the obligations imposed, and power conferred, upon
</p>
<p>me by the Constitution."
</p>
<p>The slave power had now determined to prevent the ad
</p>
<p>mission of California into the Union as a State. It had the
</p>
<p>requisite population, and had formed a Constitution forbidding
</p>
<p>slavery ; and President Taylor, in his message, recommended
</p>
<p>that it be admitted. Utah andNjew Mexico he recommended,
</p>
<p>without mixing the slavery question with their territorial
</p>
<p>governments, to be left to ripen into States, and then settle
</p>
<p>that question for themselves in their State Constitutions.
</p>
<p>The slave power had put a scheme on foot in Texas, by which
</p>
<p>that State claimed half of New Mexico, a province settled
</p>
<p>two hundred years before Texan independence. It wanted
</p>
<p>to settle this boundary by force of arms from Texas. But here
</p>
<p>the President was determined that the political and judicial
</p>
<p>authority of the United States should settle the boundary.
</p>
<p>The wrath of the slave holders now increased against him.
</p>
<p>Having before defeated their fillibustering scheme against Cu
</p>
<p>ba, recommending the admission of California with a Constitu
</p>
<p>tion prohibiting slavery, and advising the dropping of the slave
</p>
<p>ry question concerning New Mexico and Utah, and refusing to
</p>
<p>recognize the forged claims of the Texan slave holders to half
</p>
<p>of New Mexico ; and to the foregoing his pitting himself
</p>
<p>against Calhoun, in adding to his Message the above ex
</p>
<p>tract, after the arch-traitor had requested that all mention of
</p>
<p>the Union should be excluded from it, the slave power had
</p>
<p>now sufficient reason to count him as an enemy, and his histo
</p>
<p>ry gave them to understand that he never surrendered. Those
</p>
<p>having slavery politically committed to their care, had long,
</p>
<p>before sworn that no person should ever occupy the Presiden
</p>
<p>tial Chair that opposed their schemes in the interest of slave
</p>
<p>ry. They resolved to take his life.

<p>To show the bitterness of the slave power, we make an ex

</p>
<p>dent Taylor, and after the Annual Message of the latter ap
</p>
<p>peared : " It (the Union) can not then be saved by eulogies on
</p>
<p>it. However splendid or numerous the cry of Union, Union, the
</p>
<p>glorious Union, it can no more prevent disunion than the cry of
</p>
<p>Health, health, glorious health, on the part of the physician,
</p>
<p>can save a patient from dying, who is lying dangerously ill."
</p>
<p>It was generally understood at Washington that the free
</p>
<p>soil wing of the Whig Party had the ear of President Tay
</p>
<p>lor, and that Millard Fillmore had but little voice or influence.
</p>
<p> See Ormsby's History of the Whig Party, pp. 312.
</p>
<p>This the slave power understood, and they determined to
</p>
<p>serve him as they had previously served General Harrison ;
</p>
<p>and only awaited a favorable opportunity to carry out their
</p>
<p>hellish intent. The celebration of the 4th of July was near
</p>
<p>at hand ; and it was resolved to take advantage of that day,
</p>
<p>and give him the fatal drug. Being well planned, he received
</p>
<p>it at the right time, and with the same medical accurcy as did
</p>
<p>Gen. Harrison.
</p>
<p>The political magazine was purposely charged with the rest
</p>
<p>less element of slavery. This was done to prepare a way for
</p>
<p>the President's death, that it might pass unnoticed in the
</p>
<p>m'd<t of the general explosion. Notwithstanding the threat
</p>
<p>ening of the slave power, the correspondent of the New York
</p>
<p>Even ng Post telegraphed from Washington, July 3d, 1850,
</p>
<p>I hit "the President remains firmly determined to defend
</p>
<p>the possession of the United States Government to that ter
</p>
<p>ritory at all hazards." But the last charge was placed in
</p>
<p>the m igazine when Ex-Governor Quitman, of Mississippi, tel
</p>
<p>egraphed to Washington, on the same day, (3d) that he was
</p>
<p>rtady, at the head of 10,000 men, to march on Santa Fe, New
</p>
<p>Mexico." This was all done to force President Taylor to sub
</p>
<p>mit to demands of the slave power. It failed; but it placed
</p>
<p>the torch to the fuse, and amid the excitement of the 4th of
</p>
<p>July, the explosion took place. It accomplished the object
</p>
<p> victory and revenge through the death of tlie President.

<p>The New York Post of the 10th, says : " In the contention
</p>
<p>which has raged at the seat of Government, the stroke of
</p>
<p>54 DESPERATE SCHEMES OF
</p>
<p>death has fallen upon one to whom his station assigned no
</p>
<p>small part of the controversy  the Chief Magistrate of the
</p>
<p>country, Gen. Taylor." He would undoubtedly have checked,
</p>
<p>by the most effectual means, any effort on the part of Texas
</p>
<p>to engage in a civil war with the people of New Mexico. The
</p>
<p>Post further says : " It strikes us that it is by no means a for
</p>
<p>tunate circumstance for the cause of freedom."
</p>
<p>In the enjoyment of the most perfect health, the 4th being
</p>
<p>on Friday, he was taken sick in the afternoon about 5 o'clock,
</p>
<p>and on Monday evening at 35 minutes past 10 o'clock, he was
</p>
<p>dead. He died from the effects of the same kind of drug as
</p>
<p>was given to president Harrison. The symptoms in both case3
</p>
<p>were the same  an inward heat and thirst, accompanied by fe
</p>
<p>ver. They were both well and hearty at the time the drug wa3
</p>
<p>given, and both died within a few days after taking it. Mr.
</p>
<p>Benton, speaking of the occurrence, says that "he sat out all
</p>
<p>the speeches, and omitted no attention which he believed the
</p>
<p>decorum of his station required. The ceremony took place on
</p>
<p>Friday, and on Tuesday following he was a corpse. The violent
</p>
<p>attack commenced soon after his return to tlie Presidential Man
</p>
<p>sion." Page 763, Vol. II.
</p>
<p>Gen. Taylor's case being considered by his physicians, (a
</p>
<p>portion of them having likewise attended General Harrison,)
</p>
<p>called it "billions cholera," in other words, gastro-enteritis.
</p>
<p>No doubt produced, as Dr. Taylor on poisons, page 123, says,
</p>
<p>by " instant poisons." The whole of the circumstances in this
</p>
<p>case prove conclusively that he had been poisoned. He lived,
</p>
<p>as before stated, about the same length of time from the date
</p>
<p>of receiving the fatal drug which caused his death, as did
</p>
<p>General Harrison. The authority I have quoted in Gen. Har
</p>
<p>rison's case, is applicable in that of Gen. Taylor's. Well may
</p>
<p>it be supposed that the assassin who had so managed the
</p>
<p>poison in General Harrison's case, knew well how to apply
</p>
<p>it to Gen. Taylor with equal success. See Grant's Letter.

</p>
<p>month after taking his seat, it was not considered prudent to
</p>
<p>immediately dispatch President Taylor. Therefore, for the
</p>
<p>TRAITORS IN CONGRESS. 55
</p>
<p>sake of policy, he was borne with for one year and four
</p>
<p>months. He was in favor of the good old Union, and was in
</p>
<p>a position to protect it if assailed. They knew he was a sol
</p>
<p>dier that never surrendered. Patriotic, almost to devotion,
</p>
<p>and too much of a statesman to see his country divided by in
</p>
<p>trigue, although himself owning slaves, still like Washington
</p>
<p>he was opposed to slavery extension, and would have rejoiced
</p>
<p>to have seen some plan devised by which it could be abol
</p>
<p>ished. They slew him on Independence Day, while pouring
</p>
<p>out his soul in devotion to his country.
</p>
<p>"With increased lustre on the march of time,
</p>
<p>Forever may his star of glory shine."
</p>
<p>Millard Fillmore now became President. This individual
</p>
<p>has always been in favor of granting everything to slavery.
</p>
<p>Taylor, Avhile alive, discerning his truckling disposition, gave
</p>
<p>him the cold shoulder. Thus, when Fillmore came into power,
</p>
<p>he discharged every Cabinet Officer that had served under
</p>
<p>President Taylor, and gathered around him new associates 
</p>
<p>men principally of the hush-up policy, who wanted peace in their
</p>
<p>day. It was left for Fillmore to sign the act admitting California,
</p>
<p>President Taylor having been assassinated before the bill
</p>
<p>passed Congress. After it had passed, ten Southern Sen
</p>
<p>ators offered a protest. Of course their protest amounted
</p>
<p>to a burlesque. The yeas in the Senate was 34 ; nays, only 18.
</p>
<p>William M. Guyn, and John C. Fremont, were now ad
</p>
<p>mitted as Senators from the new State, and thus ended the
</p>
<p>struggle with the slave power for the admission of California.
</p>
<p>Calhoun's last speech was devoted chiefly to that subject.
</p>
<p>It was read by James M. Mason of Virginia, on the 4th of
</p>
<p>March, 1850. Calhoun was then sick and unable even to read
</p>
<p>it. This speech surpassed all that he had before delivered in
</p>
<p>bitterness against the Union. After asserting that all the
</p>
<p>principal cords that bound it together had been snapped asun
</p>
<p>der, and nothing now remained to hold it together except

<p>force.
</p>
<p>56 DESPERATE SCHEMES OF
</p>
<p>The next move to appease the slave power was the passage
</p>
<p>of the Fugitive Slave Law. The records and acts of the General
</p>
<p>Government, from its ' earliest organization, were scrutinized
</p>
<p>for authority to fall back on as a basis. This was one of the
</p>
<p>measures of Mr. Clay's Compromise, which had to have a
</p>
<p>separate hearing, as he was unable to get all included in one
</p>
<p>bill. The vote on its passage in the Senate was, yeas 27, nays
</p>
<p>12. About twenty Senators did not vote either way, and
</p>
<p>were mostly against its passage. Butler, of South Carolina,
</p>
<p>was the father of the Fugitive Slave Bill, and Mason, of Vir
</p>
<p>ginia, was its step daddy.
</p>
<p>President Fillmore signed the Fugitive Slave Bill, and has re
</p>
<p>ceived the censure of a great portion of the Northern people for so
</p>
<p>doing. Whether he received sufficient intimation, after signing the
</p>
<p>bill admitting California, to intimidate him, we are not prepared to
</p>
<p>say. He is yet living, and perhaps can give an answer. One thing
</p>
<p>is certain, it has served as his political grave. It is not probable
</p>
<p>that twenty negroes were ever reclaimed under the action of the
</p>
<p>law. It was got up solely as a gag to the free States. " That, or
</p>
<p>break up the Union /" was the cry.
</p>
<p>The time of another presidential election was approaching, and
</p>
<p>the flames of revolt were bursting out all over tbe South. In every
</p>
<p>quarter disunion meetings were being held, and treasonable toasts
</p>
<p>being drunk. Many and very violent speeches were made in the
</p>
<p>South Carolina Legislature.
</p>
<p>One remarked : " We must secede .... If we can get but
</p>
<p>one State to unite with us, we must act. Once being inde
</p>
<p>pendent, we would have a strong ally in England ; but we
</p>
<p>must prepare for secession."
</p>
<p>Another said, " He hated and detested the Union, and was
</p>
<p>in favor of cutting the connection." He avowed himself a
</p>
<p>disunionist  a disunionist per se. If he had the power he
</p>
<p>would crush the Union to-morrow.
</p>
<p>In the Nashville Convention, one member remarked : " Se
</p>
<p>cession, united secession of the slaveholding States, or a large

</p>
<p>number of them ; nothing else will be wise, nothing else will
</p>
<p>be practicable. The Rubicon is passed ; the Union is already
</p>
<p>dissolved." Further : " Should we be wise enough to unite,
</p>
<p>TRAITORS IN CONGRESS. 57
</p>
<p>all California, with her exhaustless treasures, would be ours ;
</p>
<p>all New Mexico also."
</p>
<p>The following was given as a Fourth of July toast : " The
</p>
<p>American Eagle :  in the event of a dissolution of the Union,
</p>
<p>the South claims as her portion the heart of the noble bird ;
</p>
<p>to the Yankees we leave the feathers and carcass."
</p>
<p>One toast given at a meeting in Charleston, South Carolina,
</p>
<p>reads : " The Union, founded by ignorance, and continued only
</p>
<p>by knavery."
</p>
<p>Another Fourth of July toast was : " The Union,  a splen
</p>
<p>did failure of the first modern attempt by people of different in
</p>
<p>stitutions to live under the same Government."
</p>
<p>The administration of Millard Fillmore had become very
</p>
<p>unpopular with those who placed him in power. If Taylor
</p>
<p>had been permitted to live, and go through his term with the
</p>
<p>same determination as he commenced, the Whig party would
</p>
<p>have become strong and popular in the free States. But Fill
</p>
<p>more's course resulted in the entire annihilation of the party
</p>
<p>which elected him.
</p>
<p>During the term for which Zachary Taylor was elected,
</p>
<p>and Millard Fillmore served, three Senators of high influence
</p>
<p>in their party went to their final account. John C. Calhoun
</p>
<p>died on the last day of March, 1850. Henry Clay died in
</p>
<p>June of 1852. Daniel Webster, who was Secretary of State
</p>
<p>to Fillmore, died in October, 1852. Neither of the above
</p>
<p>lived to witness another Presidential election. Calhoun lived
</p>
<p>to hear the efforts of his two powerful opponents, Webster
</p>
<p>and Clay, in reply to his, read by Mason, on the 4th of March.
</p>
<p>The campaign of 1852, wherein Wiufield Scott, as Presi
</p>
<p>dent, and Wm. A. Graham, as Vice President, were the can
</p>
<p>didates, was peculiar. Fillmore, by his conservatism, which
</p>
<p>amounted to submission, had completely disgusted the Free-
</p>
<p>soil element. It was generally understood that Scott and
</p>
<p>Graham were under the control of the views of this party.
</p>
<p>The compromise measures brought about by Mr. Clay in the

<p>latter part of his life, were approved by both the Whig and
</p>
<p>Democratic platforms. Many of Scott's friends said they ac-
</p>
<p>58 DESPERATE SCHEMES
</p>
<p>cepted his nomination, but " spit upon the platform." The
</p>
<p>conservative or submission wing of the party were opposed to
</p>
<p>what they regarded as sectional issues.
</p>
<p>Franklin Pierce for President, and Wm. R. King for Vice
</p>
<p>President, were the Democratic nominees.
</p>
<p>. The platforms of the two parties were nearly the same, and
</p>
<p>the conservative or submissive wing . of the Whig party left
</p>
<p>Scott and Graham to be supported by the Free-soil element,
</p>
<p>and went over in mass to the support of Pierce and King,
</p>
<p>the Democratic nominees.
</p>
<p>The reasons for nominating Scott were his alledged availa
</p>
<p>bility and reliability. The platform represented all, and yet it
</p>
<p>poorly represented any of the party ; it embraced too much
</p>
<p>for some, and too little for others. With the Democrats, their
</p>
<p>platform was everything the candidates nothing. Pierce was

<p>unknown and untried ; like John Tyler he might betray the

<p>electoral votes, carrying twenty-seven States, while Scott got

<p>only 42 electoral votes, securing only four States.
</p>
<p>The anti-slavery party first appeared with James G. Birney
</p>
<p>as its presidential candidate in 1840. It polled at this elec

<p>tion 7,000 votes. In 1844, under ,the same leader, it polled
</p>
<p>62,140 votes. The abolition of slavery in the District of Co
</p>
<p>lumbia and Territories, was the demand of the party in both
</p>
<p>the above canvasses. In the contest of 1848 the vote of Van
</p>
<p>Buren and Gerrit Smith together was 296,232, and that of

<p>John P. Hale, in 1852, was 157,296. This party did not carry

<p>a single""State at any of the four presidential elections. Their

<p>Whig parties with diverting the National Government from

<p>the path originally designed by its founders into by-ways and

<p>of slavery, after the year 1800, in all the Territories of the

<p>United States, Southern and Northern ; and they also referred

</p>
<p>gates voted for that proviso, while only three States and
</p>
<p>SLAVERY OUTRAGES IN KANSAS. 59
</p>
<p>seven delegates voted against it. These charges concerning
</p>
<p>the Whig and Democratic party were only partially histori
</p>
<p>cally correct, but were prophecies of a coming time, true as
</p>
<p>any ever uttered by Isaiah or Jeremiah, and were exactly and

<p>literally fulfilled by the Man of Sin, Franklin Pierce, and his
</p>
<p>unfortunate administration.
</p>
<p>USURPING EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OF THE FEDERAL TERRITORY, AND
</p>
<p>FORCING SLAVERY INTO KANSAS.
</p>
<p>The South have always claimed that the Federal Con
</p>
<p>stitution recognized 'slavery ; and that the slaveholders had
</p>
<p>the undisputed right to remove with their slaves into any
</p>
<p>of the Territories belonging to the General Government,
</p>
<p>and it was bound to protect them. The passage of the Mis
</p>
<p>souri Compromise Act, which excluded slavery north of 36
</p>
<p>deg- 30 min., they viewed as a concession (unconstitution
</p>
<p>al) on their part to preserve the peace of the country. Mr.
</p>
<p>Douglas placed his authority for disturbing that Compro
</p>
<p>mise, on its being superseded by the Compromise of Mr. Clay,
</p>
<p>in 1850, which reads :
</p>
<p>" Resolved, That as slavery does not exist by raw, and is not
</p>
<p>likely to be introduced into any territory acquired by the
</p>
<p>United States from Mexico, it is inexpedient for Congress to
</p>
<p>provide by law either for its introduction or exclusion from
</p>
<p>any part of said territory ;* and that appropriate territorial
</p>
<p>governments ought to be established by Congress
</p>
<p>without the adoption of any restriction or condition on the
</p>
<p>subject of slavery."
</p>
<p>The following is the clause in the. Nebraska and Kansas
</p>
<p>bill, introduced by Mr. Douglas, which repealed the Missouri
</p>
<p>Compromise : " Which being inconsistent with the principle
</p>
<p>of non-intervention by Congress with slavery in the States
</p>
<p>and Territories, as recognized by the legislation of 1850, com
</p>
<p>monly called the Compromise Measures, is hereby declared
</p>
<p>inoperative and void ; it being the true intent and meaning
</p>
<p>of this act not to legislate slavery into any territory or State,

</p>
<p>perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions
</p>
<p>in their own way, subject only to the Constitution of the
</p>
<p>United States."
</p>
<p>Many Senators spoke against it. On the 3d of March a
</p>
<p>long debate ensued ; Mr. Douglas speaking in favor of the bill
</p>
<p>until half past three in the morning. Samuel Houston, of
</p>
<p>Texas, the only Southern Senator who opposed it3 passage,
</p>
<p>continued speaking until near five o'clock in the morning of
</p>
<p>the 4th March, 1854, when the bill was pressed to a' vote in
</p>
<p>the Senate and passed  yeas 37, nays 14.
</p>
<p>The bill amended, passed the House of Representatives
</p>
<p>May 22d, 1854  yeas 113, nays 100 ; only six members from
</p>
<p>slave States voting against it  Benton, of Missouri, Brigg,
</p>
<p>Collom, Etheridge and' Nathaniel G. Taylor, all of Tennes
</p>
<p>see, and Millson of Va. The vote on the final passage of the
</p>
<p>Senate bill, as amended by the House, was  yeas 35, nays 13.
</p>
<p>The repeal of the Missouri Compromise was a great tri
</p>
<p>umph of the slave power. It was a virtual denial that Con
</p>
<p>gress had any power over slavery in the Territories, either to
</p>
<p>legislate it into, or prohibit it from entering therein.
</p>
<p>In a speech in the Senate of the United States, in 1853,
</p>
<p>Atchison, of Missouri, remarked : " I have always been of the
</p>
<p>opinion that the first great error committed in the political
</p>
<p>history of this country -was the Ordinance of 1787, rendering
</p>
<p>the Northwestern Territories free territory ; the next great
</p>
<p>error was the adoption of the Missouri Compromise."
</p>
<p>Now the Ordinance of 1787 passed Congress July 13, 1787,
</p>
<p>just two months and four days before the adoption of the
</p>
<p>Federal Constitution. It was ceding the Territories belonging
</p>
<p>to several of the States to the General Government. It com
</p>
<p>mences as follows :
</p>
<p>" It is hereby ordained and declared by authority (of Con
</p>
<p>gress) that the following articles shall be considered as ar
</p>
<p>ticles of compact between the original States and the people
</p>
<p>and States in said territory, and forever remain unaltered,

<p>unless by common consent.
</p>
<p>" Article VI.  There shall be neither slavery nor involun-
</p>
<p>SLAVERY OUTRAGES IN KANSAS. 61
</p>
<p>tary servitude in said territory otherwise than in the punish
</p>
<p>ment of crimes, whereof the party shall have been duly con
</p>
<p>victed, provided always, that any person escaping into the
</p>
<p>same, from whom labor or service is lawfully claimed in any
</p>
<p>one of the original States, such fugitive may be lawfully re
</p>
<p>claimed and conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor
</p>
<p>or service as aforesaid."
</p>
<p>The last part of the above article was dictated by the same
</p>
<p>interest and influence that two months afterwards engrafted
</p>
<p>into the Constitution of the United States the last clause of
</p>
<p>Section 2d, Article 4th.
</p>
<p>While this act made free the Northwest Territory, it also
</p>
<p>established the basis for the Fugitive Slave Act.
</p>
<p>Congress then had exercised the power to legislate con
</p>
<p>cerning slavery in the territories ; first, the Ordinance of
</p>
<p>1787 ; second, the Missouri Compromise, of 1820.
</p>
<p>The slave interest never acquiesced in either of these
</p>
<p>measures. They claimed that slavery was above compromise,
</p>
<p>Congress, and the Constitution ; no compromise could restrict
</p>
<p>it ; no Congress could prohibit it from extending into the
</p>
<p>Territories ; and the Constitution guarded and recognized
</p>
<p>it, while the Supreme Court, as property, protected it. This
</p>
<p>was the sentiment of the slavery propagandists ; while those
</p>
<p>wishing to restrict its extension in later years pointed to
</p>
<p>1787 and 1820, as precedents which sustained their position.
</p>
<p>If Congress could make free the Northwest Territory, and
</p>
<p>prohibit slavery above 36 deg. 30 min., why could it not pro
</p>
<p>hibit it from entering any Federal Territory ?
</p>
<p>The controversy on this question was always exciting Con
</p>
<p>gress, and through Congress the country. Mr. Clay designed
</p>
<p>his Compromise of 1850 to quiet the agitation. Mr Douglas,
</p>
<p>in the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, thought, by re
</p>
<p>moving the question from Congress, the people in the terri
</p>
<p>tories might peaceably settle it at their own time and in their
</p>
<p>own way. But in this (though meaning well) they both were

<p>mistaken. The old Harlequin, fresh from his conflicts against
</p>
<p>the Union in Congress, with mischief in his head, honey on his
</p>
<p>62 SLAVERY OUTRAGES IN KANSAS.
</p>
<p>tongue, treason in his heart, and lust in his eye, seeks out Kan
</p>
<p>sas, which had been kept pure by the Missouri Compromise
</p>
<p>for forty years. After being kicked out of Congress on the
</p>
<p>22d of May, 1854, notwithstanding that entire country was
</p>
<p>north of 36 deg. 30 min., in defiance of his sacred obligations
</p>
<p>with the Federal Government in 1820, he now enters that
</p>
<p>peaceful Territory, with all his accustomed pomp and show of
</p>
<p>authority, and commits a political rape on its virgin soil.
</p>
<p>The slaveholders not only in Missouri, but in other slave
</p>
<p>States, took Mr. Clay's and Mr. Douglas's view of the subject,
</p>
<p>and as early as 1851 commenced to emigrate to that region.
</p>
<p>In 1854, the excitement in Missouri was intense, determined
</p>
<p>to make Kansas a slave State.
</p>
<p>John Scott's affidavit, page 898, Kansas Committee Report,
</p>
<p>shows that secret societies were then in existence, to force
</p>
<p>slavery into Kansas. This was a year before any person en
</p>
<p>tered the Territory through the influence of the New England
</p>
<p>Aid Society. See the affidavit of Matthew R. Walker, page
</p>
<p>898 ; also, that of H. Rolinson, page 900, which prove that
</p>
<p>no persons were sent out through that association, until the
</p>
<p>last of March, 1855.
</p>
<p>Governor Andrew H. Reeder of Easton, Pa., and other of
</p>
<p>ficers appointed by President Jefferson Davis Pierce on the 1st
</p>
<p>of July, arrived in that Territory on the 7th Hay of October,
</p>
<p>1854. Yet, long before this arrival, the slaveholders had
</p>
<p>everything ready. Secret Societies were every where Organ
</p>
<p>ized in Missouri and Kansas, under the names of " Social Bond,"
</p>
<p>" Blue Lodge," " Friends Society," and " Friends of the South."
</p>
<p>These societies were all got up to drive Free State Men out
</p>
<p>of the Territory, and to make Kansas a slave State. So com
</p>
<p>pletely were the pro-slavery agitators organized, that in
</p>
<p>the month following the Governor's arrival, November 29,
</p>
<p>1854, Samuel Woodson, a lawyer of Independence, Missouri,
</p>
<p>appeared at the territorial polls at Douglas, for the election
</p>
<p>of a delegate to Congress, with 200 Missourians to vote. Out

</p>
<p>Jackson Counties, numbering 140 men, camped out all night ;

<p>they said they came to vote to make Kansas a slave State.
</p>
<p>Out of 161 votes, only 30 were legal.

<p>by. the Santa F6 road, and out of 82 votes cast, only 20 were

<p>given by residents of Kansas. They also said they came to
</p>
<p>vote Kansas a slave State.

<p>6th District.  Out of 105 votes cast, 80 were from Missouri.

</p>
<p>exceed 40, only 20 of whom voted ; yet 604 votes were polled,
</p>
<p>584 of which were from Missouri. Here the Missourians
</p>
<p>voted for absent friends, whom they said instructed them to

<p>vote for them, as they could not attend.
</p>
<p>11th District. Polled 255, of which 238 were illegal.
</p>
<p>15th District.  Polled 312 votes. The Missourians from
</p>
<p>Clay, Ray, and Piatt Counties, came, they said, to make Kan
</p>
<p>sas a slave State. One hundred and sixty illegal votes were
</p>
<p>cast in this district. At this election, Nov. 29, 1854, 1,729 il
</p>
<p>legal votes were cast, to make Kansas a slave State.
</p>
<p>The residents of the Territory were completely overawed,
</p>
<p>and took very little interest in the election. In fact, not more
</p>
<p>than one-half of them went to the polls. Gen. Whitfield, the
</p>
<p>candidate of the pro-slavery mob, was elected. He received
</p>
<p>2,298 votes. Wakefield received 248, and Flenniken 305.
</p>
<p>Thus Whitfield secured his election as a delegate to Congress,
</p>
<p>for the Territory of Kansas.
</p>
<p>All this rascality was practised before the New England
</p>
<p>Aid Society was in existence, it being organized only the 21st
</p>
<p>of February, 1855.
</p>
<p>In January and February Gov. Reeder authorized the enu

<p>meration of the entire population to be taken ; it showed
</p>
<p>5,128 males, 3,383 females, 2,905 voters^ 3,469 minors, 7,161
</p>
<p>natives of the United States, 408 foreign birth, 151 free ne

<p>The Governor now issued a proclamation for an election
</p>
<p>for members of the Legislative Assembly of the Territory,
</p>
<p>64 SLAVERY OUTRAGES IN KANSAS.
</p>
<p>to be held on the 30th of March, 1855. Thirteen Members of
</p>
<p>the Council and twenty-six Representatives were to be
</p>
<p>elected. The high-handed rascality previously practised was
</p>
<p>known to have been sanctioned at Washington, which gave
</p>
<p>additional license for its repetition at this election on a large'
</p>
<p>scale. From Andrew County, in the north, to Jasper county,
</p>
<p>in the south, and as far east as Cole County, Missouri, men
</p>
<p>were organized into parties, and sent into every council dis
</p>
<p>trict in the Territory, and into every representative district
</p>
<p>but one, to vote  4,908 thus went to vote at this March elec
</p>
<p>tion ; they went armed and equipped. S. Young and C. F.
</p>
<p>Jackson had command of a portion ; they had guns, rifles,
</p>
<p>pistols, bowie knives, and two pieces of artillery loaded with
</p>
<p>musket balls. This party camped near Lawrence, about one
</p>
<p>thousand strong. In the evening preceding the election these
</p>
<p>ruffians held a meeting at the camp, and sent about two hun
</p>
<p>dred of their party into adjoining districts to vote. Those
</p>
<p>remaining to vote at Lawrence had white ribbons in their
</p>
<p>coats to distinguish them from the settlers  1,034 votes were
</p>
<p>cast, over 800 of which were illegal. In the eighteen districts
</p>
<p>the number of votes east at this (30th of March, 1855) elec
</p>
<p>tion was 6,307 ; total legal vote cast, 1,410 ; illegal vote,
</p>
<p>4,908. The free State vote was 791. Hundreds of free State
</p>
<p>men were driven from the polls, yet the free State party had a
</p>
<p>majority of 172 above all the legal votes cast in the Territory.
</p>
<p>The members thus elected held caucus meetings, during
</p>
<p>the coming in of the returns, at Westpprt and Shawnee Mis
</p>
<p>sion, and many of them secretly and openly declared that if
</p>
<p>Governor Reeder did not publicly acknowledge the legality
</p>
<p>of their election they would take his life.
</p>
<p>The Governor says : " I made arrangements to assemble a
</p>
<p>small number of friends for defence, and on the morning of
</p>
<p>the 6th of April I proceeded to announce my decision upon
</p>
<p>the returns. Upon One side of( the room were arrayed the

<p>members elect, nearly, if rfot quite, all armed ; and on the

</p>
<p>The bogus Missouri Legislature, that this same force had
</p>
<p>indirectly brought into existence, met at Pawnee, July 2d,
</p>
<p>1855. The Council was composed of 18 members, 15 of whom
</p>
<p>were from the slave States, 1 from Ohio, 1 from Indiana, and
</p>
<p>1 from New York.
</p>
<p>The House of Representatives had 35 members, 29 of whom
</p>
<p>were natives of slave States, 1 of Kansas Territory, 2 of
</p>
<p>Ohio, 2 of Pennsylvania, 1 of New York, cursing negro-steal-
</p>
<p>ers, and swearing that slavery shall be upheld, and that the
</p>
<p>virgin soil of Kansas shall never be polluted with the foul
</p>
<p>stain of Free-soil-ism ; the Union only when it protects sla
</p>
<p>very. Every member of the House was pro-slavery except
</p>
<p>S. D. Hunter, a native of Ohio, and he resigned. Against this
</p>
<p>worse than rascality, the free States turned'their backs.
</p>
<p>The house in which they met had neither doors nor win
</p>
<p>dows, and bui a temporary floor. While engaged in this high
</p>
<p>handed atrocity, that dreadful scourge, the Asiatic cholera,
</p>
<p>broke out amongst them. To avoid the wrath which high
</p>
<p>Heaven was pouring on their guilty heads, they fled to Shaw
</p>
<p>nee Mission. Here the Governor refused to recognize them,
</p>
<p>except by vetoing the tyrannical acts they were passing.
</p>
<p>Mortified at such proceedings, he came out against them, and
</p>
<p>was the author of a set of resolutions passed at Big Springs,
</p>
<p>the first of which was :
</p>
<p>"Resolved, That we owe no allegiance or obedience to the
</p>
<p>tyrannical enactments of the spurious Legislature ; that their
</p>
<p>laws have no validity or binding force upon the people of
</p>
<p>Kansas." Gov. Reeder arrived in Washington in the beginning of
</p>
<p>May, 1855. He had previously written several confidential
</p>
<p>letters to the President, giving a detailed history of events.
</p>
<p>Pierce expressed himself, at the first interview, as highly
</p>
<p>pleased and satisfied with the Governor's course, and, says
</p>
<p>Reeder, " in the most unequivocal language approved and en
</p>
<p>dorsed all I had done."
</p>
<p>But Jeff. Davis demanded Reeder's removal. This placed

</p>
<p>the President in a new position, and he therefore immediately
</p>
<p>66 SLAVERY OUTRAGES IN KANSAS.
</p>
<p>went to work to induce Reeder to resign. "At the next in
</p>
<p>terview he expressed great fear," says Reeder, " for my per
</p>
<p>sonal safety if I returned to the Territory, and offered to ap
</p>
<p>point me Minister to China, alleging that McLane, then Min
</p>
<p>ister, was about to return home." To this new proposition
</p>
<p>the Governor remarked, that if he could be satisfied that the
</p>
<p>people of Kansas would be as fully cared for as if he re
</p>
<p>mained in office, and a successor was appointed who would
</p>
<p>resist the aggressive invasion from Missouri, he was willing
</p>
<p>to coincide.
</p>
<p>Pierce assured him that he would appoint some honorable,
</p>
<p>upright, Northern man, who was above intimidation and cor
</p>
<p>ruption, and one that would faithfully perform his duty. At
</p>
<p>this interview he'requested Pierce to issue a proclamation re
</p>
<p>citing what had been done in Kansas, and strongly disap
</p>
<p>proving it, and pledging his administration against foreign
</p>
<p>interference with Kansas affairs. Pierce now began to talk
</p>
<p>about Kansas Emigrant Aid Societies, and Reeder began to
</p>
<p>suspect. At the next interview the Governor said to the
</p>
<p>President : " It is evident that you are about to make conces
</p>
<p>sions in the wrong direction. I have had a great opportunity
</p>
<p>to ascertain the facts, and I consider this a clear case of ag
</p>
<p>gression on Northern rights, and whatever of concession or
</p>
<p>compensation is to be made should be to the North, and not
</p>
<p>to the South ; the interests (continued the Governor) of the
</p>
<p>Democratic party and the principles of truth and justice
</p>
<p>loudly require it."
</p>
<p>Pierce, fearing to dismiss Reeder, offers a bribe. " If (says
</p>
<p>the incorruptible Jefferson Davis Pierce) the vacation of j'our
</p>
<p>office could be satisfactorily adjusted, all matters could he ar
</p>
<p>ranged in such a way as to promote your personal interests."
</p>
<p>The Governor considered himself insulted, and refused to
</p>
<p>reply, and also refused to resign, and left the room. Pierce
</p>
<p>waited until the last of July and then removed him. Reeder
</p>
<p>received his notice to quit on the 15th of August, 1855. Thus

<p>of slavery. He said himself that he was always in favor of

<p>granting the compromises which had satisfied the South, and
</p>
<p>secured their rights against the clamors of anti-slavery men.

<p>The animal in Kansas he was unable to tame,

<p>Although concession to slavery was his political game.
</p>
<p>The abolition clamor he had always despised,
</p>
<p>But his experience as Governor wide opened his eyes.
</p>
<p>Wilson Shannon now received the appointment from the
</p>
<p>President to take the place of Gov. Reeder. Mr. Shannon
</p>
<p>went out from the bosom of the pro-slavery administration at
</p>
<p>Washington with decisive instructions. He proceeded to Shaw
</p>
<p>nee Mission, and in a loyal epistle to the President, dated Nov.
</p>
<p>28, 1855, calls the pro-slavery agitators the " Law and order
</p>
<p>party." The Free State Men, he termed violent " Abolition
</p>
<p>ists." Notwithstanding the Governor well knew that in April
</p>
<p>of that year Malcomb Clark, a rigid pro-slavery man had
</p>
<p>commenced a deadly assault on Cole McCrea, at a meeting at
</p>
<p>Leavenworth . And it was also known to him how Mr. Phillips,
</p>
<p>a lawyer of the same place, had been violently seized and taken
</p>
<p>across the river into Missouri, tarred and feathered, and rode
</p>
<p>on a rail, and his head shaved on one side ; after which they
</p>
<p>went through the mockery of selling him at auction, com
</p>
<p>pelling a negro to act as auctioneer. He also knew that R.
</p>
<p>R. Rees, and other members of the bogus Kansas Legisla
</p>
<p>ture, publicly encouraged and justified these lawless outrages.
</p>
<p>He also knew that officers holding high position, such as Judge
</p>
<p>Lecompt, Associate Judge, S. G. Cato, and J. M". Burnell,
</p>
<p>Judge Wood, of the Police Court of Douglas County, and S.
</p>
<p>J. Jones, Sheriff of the same County, with Marshal Donald
</p>
<p>son, had organized themselves and friends, to the number of
</p>
<p>30, into a Vigilance Committee. He knew that in their offi
</p>
<p>cial capacity they winked at gambling, for it was a favorite
</p>
<p>amusement to join Sheriff Jones in a game of poker at 10
</p>
<p>cent ante.

<p>About this time, 1855, John Brown, of Harper's Ferry no-
</p>
<p>68 SLAVERY OUTRAGES IN KANSAS.
</p>
<p>toriety, emigrated to Kansas, and settled in Osage County.
</p>
<p>He was an Abolitionist, and soon became the object of the
</p>
<p>I most violent assaults from the Missourians. One of his sons,
</p>
<p>Frederick* was met by a party of these invading ruffians,
</p>
<p>alone in the road, and murdered in cold blood. His body
</p>
<p>was stripped of its raiment, and his privates cut off and stuck
</p>
<p>in Ms mouth. John, another son, for being an Abolitionist,
</p>
<p>was caught, loaded with chains, and driven on foot before
</p>
<p>the horses of his captors, from Ossawatomie to Tecumseh.
</p>
<p>The cruelty was such that his reason was destroyed. The
</p>
<p>house of the old man, as well as that of his son, was set on
</p>
<p>fire and destroyed. The female portion of his family were
</p>
<p>grossly insulted, and attempts made to ravish them. Brown
</p>
<p>was now ordered to leave the Territory in three days, or sub
</p>
<p>mit to be hung. The five men who thus warned him, did not
</p>
<p>survive many hours. The only reply Brown made, was, "you
</p>
<p>will not find me here then, gentlemen ! " Before the next sun
</p>
<p>rose, they were in eternity. If he had not killed them, they
</p>
<p>certainly would have hung him.
</p>
<p>Brown's fame as a warrior now began to spread ; and H.
</p>
<p>Clay Pate, with a party of thirty -three, started from Westport,
</p>
<p>Missouri, to capture the old man. Brown heard of his com
</p>
<p>ing, and with a party of sixteen men met Pate at Black Jack,
</p>
<p>near the Santa Fe road. After a short fight, a few being
</p>
<p>killed, the gallant Pate surrendered. Coleman, the murderer
</p>
<p>of Dow, was with Pate, but he was well mounted, and, with a
</p>
<p>Wyandot Indian named Long, made his escape.
</p>
<p>At another time Whitfield raised in Jackson county, Mis
</p>
<p>souri, two hundred and twenty men to capture Brown. The
</p>
<p>old man heard of the move, and gathered up one hundred
</p>
<p>and sixty men, and took up a position on the Santa Fe" road,
</p>
<p>where he knew Whitfield would have to pass. Fifty of his
</p>
<p>men had Sharp's rifles, which would kill at half a mile. The
</p>
<p>" rest of his party he had concealed in the timber to make the

<p>attack on the flank. " Colonel Sumner, of Fort Leavenworth,
</p>
<p>heard of the expected battle, and came with a squad of dra
</p>
<p>goons, and dispersed both parties. Sumner remarked that it
</p>
<p>was fortunate for the Missourians that he had arrived, for
</p>
<p>Brown was. so fixed that he would have killed and captured
</p>
<p>the entire party.
</p>
<p>In 1856 John Reid, a lawyer of Jackson county, and mem
</p>
<p>ber of the Missouri Legislature, raised three hundred men,
</p>
<p>and two pieces of artillery, and marched on Ossawatomie.
</p>
<p>Brown this time was taken by surprise ; he gathered his
</p>
<p>forces, and had barely time to get into the timber which lines
</p>
<p>the Osage river with only thirty men and a limited supply of
</p>
<p>amunition. The enemy soon came in full view. Brown, al
</p>
<p>though they were ten to_ one against him, commenced the
</p>
<p>fight. Reid, not knowing his numbers, and fearing an ambus
</p>
<p>cade, would not venture into the woods, and his artillery did
</p>
<p>but little harm, as Brown's men lay flat on their faces, their
</p>
<p>guns loading at the breech. Sixty-seven of Reid's men were
</p>
<p>soon killed and wounded; only two of Brown's men were
</p>
<p>killed. He retired up the river through the timber and
</p>
<p>crossed the ford.
</p>
<p>Gambling, theft, burglary, forgery, rape and murder, were
</p>
<p>all encouraged when committed on or against Free State Men
</p>
<p>or Abolitionists. Speaking of these times, Committee Re
</p>
<p>port, page 65, says : " All the restraints which American cit
</p>
<p>izens are accustomed to pay even to the appearance of law,
</p>
<p>were thrown off. Homicides became frequent. All the pro
</p>
<p>visions of the Constitution of the United States, securing per
</p>
<p>sons and property, were wholly disregarded. The officers of
</p>
<p>the law, instead of protecting the people, were engaged in
</p>
<p>these outrages, and in no instance did we learn that any man
</p>
<p>was arrested, indicted, or punished for any of these crimes."
</p>
<p>Such were the men who represented the Administration of
</p>
<p>Pierce in Kansas. Reeder having repudiated them, Wilson

<p>adviser. He assured these bad men that the administration
</p>
<p>would use, if necessary, all the Federal forces stationed in the
</p>
<p>70 SLAVERY OUTRAGES IN KANSAS.
</p>
<p>districts to make Kansas a slave State. Franklin M. Coleman,
</p>
<p>a resident of Hickory Point, and native of Brook Co., Vir
</p>
<p>ginia, had been to the Shawnee Mission to receive the ap
</p>
<p>pointment of Justice of the Peace. Enlivened and encour
</p>
<p>aged by the remarks of the Governor, he returned to his
</p>
<p>home, feeling strong in the pro-slavery cause, and on the 27th
</p>
<p>of November, 1855, shot and killed a peaceable and inoffen
</p>
<p>sive citizen by the name of Dow, a Free State Man, native of
</p>
<p>Ohio. Coleman went immediately to the Shawnee Mission, right
</p>
<p>into the arms of Gov. Shannon, for protection. Not finding
</p>
<p>Shannon at home, he sought out Sheriff Jones, of Douglas
</p>
<p>county, who was at or near the Mission at the time. Jones
</p>
<p>was the Sheriff of the county where the crime was com
</p>
<p>mitted. The Sheriff and' Coleman went to Lecompton, where,
</p>
<p>without form of law, without issuing a writ, entered $500 straw
</p>
<p>bail, and Coleman continued free. As the murder was viewed
</p>
<p>as political, the free State men threatened vengeance on those
</p>
<p>who had been instrumental in committing, or justifying the
</p>
<p>fatal crime. Instead of being punished, Coleman found the
</p>
<p>officers of the law his justifiers and protectors. This course
</p>
<p>greatly enraged the free State party. Jacob Branson, a free
</p>
<p>State resident of Hickory Point, and intimate friend of the
</p>
<p>murdered man, had, with others, been freely expressing his
</p>
<p>feelings about this high-handed outrage. One Harrison Buck
</p>
<p>ley, and Josiah Hargis, both of these men were implicated
</p>
<p>with Coleman in the murder of Dow.
</p>
<p>On the 26th of November a large meeting was held on the
</p>
<p>identical spot where Dow was killed. At this meeting reso
</p>
<p>lutions were passed, one of which reads :
</p>
<p>" Whereas, Charles W. Dow, a citizen of this place, was mur
</p>
<p>dered on Wednesday afternoon last ; and whereas evidence,
</p>
<p>by admission and otherwise, fastens the guilt of saicl murder
</p>
<p>on one F. M. Coleman ; and whereas facts indicate that other
</p>
<p>parties, namely, Buckley, Hargis, Wagner, Reynolds and Moo
</p>
<p>dy, and others were implicated in said murder ; and whereas

</p>
<p>facts further indicate that said individuals and parties are
</p>
<p>SLAVERY OUTRAGES IN KANSAS. 71
</p>
<p>combining for the purpose of harassing and murdering un
</p>
<p>offending citizens; and whereas we are now destitute of law,
</p>
<p>even for the punishment of crime, in this Territory :
</p>
<p>" Resolved, That a Vigilance Committee of twenty-five be
</p>
<p>appointed, whose duty it shall be to bring the above-named
</p>
<p>individuals, as well as those connected with them in this
</p>
<p>affair, to justice."
</p>
<p>It was at this time, when the public pulse had been greatly
</p>
<p>excited by the murder and outrage, on the very same eve
</p>
<p>ning of the meeting, that pro-slavery Sheriff Jones, with a
</p>
<p>posse of twenty-five ruffians, armed with a peace warrant,
</p>
<p>which had been procured for the purpose from a pro-slavery
</p>
<p>Justice, by Harrison Buckley, entered said Branson's house,
</p>
<p>breaking in the door, at the dead of night, and with deadly
</p>
<p>weapons in their hands presented and aimed at his head,
</p>
<p>commanded him to put on his clothes, or they would blow
</p>
<p>out his brains. Branson being a highly respectable citizen,
</p>
<p>with whom Mr. Dow, the murdered man, before his death
</p>
<p>had boarded, his friends met the Sheriff and his party at
</p>
<p>Bolton's Bridge. Jones, in the meantime, had told Branson
</p>
<p>that he heard there were one hundred men at his house, but
</p>
<p>was sorry when he found it untrue, for it cheated him out of
</p>
<p>his expected sport. Just when this conversation was going
</p>
<p>on, a party of about forty formed in a line across the road.
</p>
<p>Jones and his party halted and cried out, " What's up ?"
</p>
<p>" That's just what we want to know ; what's up ?" was the
</p>
<p>reply. Branson said they had got him a prisoner. Some one
</p>
<p>in the rescuing party told him to come over to their side ; he
</p>
<p>did so, dismounted the mule, and drove it back to Jones.
</p>
<p>Jones and his party were then permitted to go about their
</p>
<p>business. Two of the men who were implicated in Daw's
</p>
<p>murder were with Jones as aids, and it was believed that
</p>
<p>Coleman was with him also. This was the alleged cause for
</p>
<p>Gov. Shannon's Wakarusa war.
</p>
<p>Sheriff Jones, immediately on his return, sent Hargis with

<p>a note to Governor Shannon, informing him of what had oc
</p>
<p>curred, winding up with this : " You may consider an open
</p>
<p>72 SLAVERY OUTRAGES IN KANSAS.
</p>
<p>rebellion as having already commenced, and I call upon you
</p>
<p>for three thousand men to carry out the laws."
</p>
<p>[Signed] * SAMUEL J. JONES,
</p>
<p>Sheriff of Douglus County.
</p>
<p>To His Excellency
</p>
<p>Wilson Shannon,
</p>
<p>Governor qf Kansas Territory.
</p>
<p>Nov. 27, 1855.
</p>
<p>Shannon immediately authorized Major General Wm. P.
</p>
<p>Richardson, of Doniphan County, to collect as large a force as
</p>
<p>he could in his division, and bring them with all speed to Le
</p>
<p>compton. Six days after this request was made, Richardson
</p>
<p>was at Lecompton with about 2,000 men. Word was also sent
</p>
<p>to Gen. Strickler, at Tecumseh, (distant about 12 miles from
</p>
<p>Lecompton,) to gather immediately as many men as possible,
</p>
<p>and come in all haste to Lecompton. Strickler brought about
</p>
<p>75 men. Official orders were sent to both of these Generals,
</p>
<p>dated on the same day of Jones' demand, (27th of November.)
</p>
<p>Copies of these official orders of the Governor were taken by
</p>
<p>Jones' force, and circulated in that part of Missouri bordering
</p>
<p>on Kansas. This part of the State has about 50,000 slaves.
</p>
<p>The story, as told, was that the Territorial law had been set
</p>
<p>at defiance, and Jones, the Sheriff of Douglas county, a Vir
</p>
<p>ginian, and a strong pro-slavery man, had been threatened
</p>
<p>with death, and no doubt ere this had been murdered -by an
</p>
<p>abolition mob.
</p>
<p>The long wished-for opportunity had now arrived (that was
</p>
<p>an excuse) to enter Kansas and, at the point of the bayonet,
</p>
<p>drive the hated free State men out of the Territory. Old
</p>
<p>age and youth began to assemble at the camp at Wakarusa.
</p>
<p>Shannon said these men came there to fight ; they did not
</p>
<p>want peace ; it was war to the knife ; they would come, and
</p>
<p>it was impossible to prevent them. They came to serve under
</p>
<p>Sheriff Jones, and he readily enrolled them in his posse.
</p>
<p>Generals Richardson and Strickler had under their com

</p>
<p>mand about 275 men. The forces thus assembled to com
</p>
<p>mence the anticipated sport of murdering free State men and
</p>
<p>SLAVERY OUTRAGES IN KANSAS. 73
</p>
<p>abolitionists, on the 2d of December, 1855, numbered about
</p>
<p>1,500 men, 925 of which were from Missouri. Shannon now
</p>
<p>began to understand and dread the consequences of calling
</p>
<p>together the pro-slavery mob.
</p>
<p>General Eastin, commander of the Northern brigade, Kan
</p>
<p>sas militia, had written to the Governor, dated Leavenworth,
</p>
<p>Nov. 30, 1855, that the free State men, one thousand strong,
</p>
<p>were well fortified at Lawrence, with cannon and Sharp's
</p>
<p>rifles. Eastin suggested in this letter that the Governor call
</p>
<p>out the United States troops stationed at Leavenworth.
</p>
<p>The Governor telegraphed (Dec. 1st) from Kansas City to
</p>
<p>President Pierce, and at the same time sent a message to Col.
</p>
<p>Sumner, commander of 1st cavalry, U. S. A., at Fort Leaven
</p>
<p>worth, informing him of what he had done and requesting
</p>
<p>the Colonel's co-operation. Sumner replied, (Dec. 1st, 1855,)
</p>
<p>" I do not feel that it would be right in me to act in this im
</p>
<p>portant matter -until orders are received from the Govern
</p>
<p>ment." Shannon now sent a letter to Gen. Richardson, commanding
</p>
<p>the Territorial militia, informing him that he had also sent
</p>
<p>Sheriff Jones a letter stating that he was endeavoring to
</p>
<p>procure the aid of the Federal forces, and requesting that
</p>
<p>they use every effort to preserve law and order ; also warn
</p>
<p>ing Jones that the forces under him were poorly armed, and
</p>
<p>would be ill prepared to come in contact with the free State
</p>
<p>party, who were well supplied with Sharp's rifles. Jones in
</p>
<p>forms the Governor by letter, on Dec. 4th, that he has suffi
</p>
<p>cient force to protect him in serving the writ, and thinks he
</p>
<p>had better not wait for the aid of the Federal forces, but to
</p>
<p>" pitch in on his own hook." He tells the Governor that the
</p>
<p>strength of the free State men has been greatly exaggerated ;
</p>
<p>he has now in his hands warrants for sixteen persons who
</p>
<p>were with the party that rescued Branson. On this very day,
</p>
<p>a mob headed by Judge Tompsonand Capt. Price, broke open
</p>
<p>the United States Arsenal at Liberty, Mo., and took three
</p>
<p>6-pounders, swords, pistols, rifles and amunition.

</p>
<p>Gen. Richardson writes to Gov. Shannon, dated Dec. 3,
</p>
<p>74 SLAVERY OUTRAGES IN KANSAS.
</p>
<p>*
</p>
<p>that it is essential to the peace of the Territory that the free
</p>
<p>State men should surrender their Sharp's rifles, and requests
</p>
<p>the Governor to give him authority to make the demand.
</p>
<p>About this time the Governor had received a reply from
</p>
<p>the President, stating that he would use all the power at his
</p>
<p>command to preserve order in the Territory, and to enforce
</p>
<p>execution of the laws. He immediately sent a letter to Col.
</p>
<p>Sumner ; also the telegraph dispatch he had received from
</p>
<p>President Pierce ; on the strength of which Sumner imme
</p>
<p>diately started with his regiment (Dec. 5th) to meet the Gov
</p>
<p>ernor at the Delaware crossing of the Kansas that evening.
</p>
<p>But the Governor did not receive Col. Sumner's dispatch
</p>
<p>until the morning of the 6th.
</p>
<p>Messrs. Lawrence and Babcock,*citizens of Lawrence, and
</p>
<p>representatives of the free State men, now waited on the Gov
</p>
<p>ernor and informed him that an armed mob was surrounding
</p>
<p>the town, and requested him to use his authority to preserve
</p>
<p>the peace, and protect the place. The Governor calculated
</p>
<p>for the Government troops under Sumner to march into the
</p>
<p>town of Lawrence, and thus protect the place from assault
</p>
<p>by the pro-slavery mob of fifteen hundred men under Jones,
</p>
<p>Richardson and Strickler.
</p>
<p>In the afternoon of Dec. 5th the Governor left Shawnee
</p>
<p>Mission. He went by the way of Westport, Missouri, to pro
</p>
<p>cure the aid of Col. Boone, a grandson of Daniel Boone. His
</p>
<p>object was to procure his influence over the pro-slavery men.
</p>
<p>They started for Lawrence ; on the way they were met by a
</p>
<p>dispatch from Col. Sumner stating that on mature reflection
</p>
<p>he had concluded not to move until he had received direct
</p>
<p>orders from the Government. Boone and the Governor hur
</p>
<p>ried onto the pro-slavery camp at Wukarusa, (within six
</p>
<p>miles of Lawrence.) This was under the command of Gen.
</p>
<p>Strickler. Gen. Richardson, who commanded anothei force
</p>
<p>of the same character at Lecompton, about 18 miles distant.

</p>
<p>had been requested by the Governor, with other leading pro-
</p>
<p>slavery men at that place, to meet him at Wakarusa. They
</p>
<p>arrived, and the Governor appointed 8 o'clock in the eve-
</p>
<p>SLAVERY OUTRAGES IN KANSAS. 75
</p>
<p>ning at his quarters for an interview. About forty of the
</p>
<p>leading pro-slavery men were there. They were all, except
</p>
<p>one, determined on the destruction of Lawrence, to which
</p>
<p>course the Governor was opposed. The conference broke
</p>
<p>up about midnight, having accomplished nothing. The Gov
</p>
<p>ernor informed them that he intended on the 7th (to-morrow)
</p>
<p>to go to Lawrence, and ascertain to what terms the free State
</p>
<p>party would accede.
</p>
<p>The Governor immediately sent an express to Col. Sumner,
</p>
<p>informing him that " it is hard to restrain the pro-slavery
</p>
<p>men from making an attack upon Lawrence ; they are beyond
</p>
<p>my power  at hast soon will be." Col. Sumner refused, without
</p>
<p>direct orders from Washington, to participate. The pro-
</p>
<p>slavery mob did not want the United States troops to inter
</p>
<p>fere, as they'felt all-powerful without them. They now be
</p>
<p>came clamorous, and refused to wait longer for diplomacy,
</p>
<p>threatened to take matters into their awn hands and raise the
</p>
<p>black flag.
</p>
<p>The Governor, on the 7th, entered Lawrence, and had an
</p>

<p>that he misunderstood its people and the territory, and that they

<p>were innocent, and had violated no law. Not one of the per

<p>sons against whom Jones had writs, were in Lawrence, and

<p>the Governor could not persuade the citizens of Lawrence

<p>to deliver up their arms to a mob. He gave orders to Gen.

</p>
<p>The Governor, now issued orders, December 8th, to Gen.
</p>
<p>Richardson and Strickler, and Sheriff Jones, to disband their
</p>
<p>forces, as matters had been arranged to the satisfaction of all
</p>
<p>parties. But the Governor was fearful of a refusal so to do,
</p>
<p>and on the 9th, next day, put the following authority into the
</p>
<p>hands of the Free State Men :
</p>
<p>" To C. Robinson and J. H. Lane, Commanders of the enrolled
</p>
<p>Citizens qf Lawrence :  You are hereby authorized and directed
</p>
<p>to take such measures, and use the enrolled forces under your
</p>
<p>command in such manner, for the promotion of the peace and
</p>
<p>the protection of the people of Lawrence and its vicinity, as
</p>
<p>in your judgment will best secure that end.

<p>Mr. Thomas W. Barber and his brother, and brother-in-law,
</p>
<p>were peaceably going from Lawrence to their home, about
</p>
<p>nine miles distant, when about half way, they were met

<p>by a party of fifteen pro-slavery ruffians. Burns and Clark

<p>were with them, and they trotted off in advance of the crowd,

<p>and overtook Mr. Barber and his party, and commenced

<p>firing on them with their revolvers. T. W. Barber was

</p>
<p>preme Court, Judge Wood of the Police Court of Douglas
</p>
<p>County, and others, to see Gov. Shannon at Wakarusa, all
</p>
<p>armed to the teeth.
</p>
<p>Under such high-handed outrages, is it any wonder that
</p>
<p>Gov. Shannon had become disgusted with the pro-slavery
</p>
<p>mob, and, like Reeder, determined, if possible, to shake them off?
</p>
<p>Thus the effort of Jefferson Davis Pierce to drive out the Free
</p>
<p>State settlers in Kansas, by calling in the pro-slavery border
</p>
<p>ruffians of Missouri, under the name of Kansas Militia, re
</p>
<p>sulted in failure. Pierce intended Col. Sumner to use the
</p>
<p>Federal forces against the Free State Men, and in favor of
</p>
<p>slavery, and expected him to act on telegraphic authority
</p>
<p>sent to Shannon ; but this wise man refused to do so without
</p>
<p>direct instructions from the War Department, which did not
</p>
<p>arrive in time.
</p>
<p>Pierce's message of the 4th of March, 1850, endorsing all
</p>
<p>the pro-slavery Kansas outrages, was the most untruthful pub
</p>
<p>lic document ever issued. Simultaneous with its issue at
</p>
<p>Washington, the Free State Legislature of Kansas assembled
</p>
<p>at Topeka. Robinson, as Governor, issued a message review
</p>
<p>ing past troubles. Notwithstanding they expected to be ar
</p>
<p>rested for treason, 22 Representatives and 11 Senators were
</p>
<p>present. Although the free State men at this time controlled
</p>
<p>four-fifths of the entire population, and the Organic Act pro
</p>
<p>vided that the Legislature shall be chosen from the residents qf
</p>
<p>the Territory, and that those who vote for them shall be actual
</p>
<p>citizens of the same.
</p>
<p>The people of the Territory had nothing to do with mak
</p>
<p>ing the laws that Gov. Shannon and the corrupt administration
</p>
<p>at Washington were endeavoring to force on them. Shannon
</p>
<p>and Pierce were compelling submission to the tyrannical acts
</p>
<p>of the pro-slavery legislature, elected by fraudulent votes from
</p>
<p>Missouri, by threatening to arrest the Governor and members
</p>
<p>of the Legislature chosen by the bona fide settlers according
</p>
<p>to the requirement qf the Organic Act of the Territory.

<p>The legislature of Kansas assembled at Topeka on the 8th
</p>
<p>of March, 1859, and elected A. H. Reeder and James H. Lane
</p>
<p>78 SLAVERY OUTRAGES IN KANSAS.
</p>
<p>United States Senators. All of these individuals expected to
</p>
<p>be arrested for treason, but were determined to make no re-
</p>
<p>sistence to the Federal officers.
</p>
<p>Gov. Shannon at this time was boarding with Clark, the
</p>
<p>Indian agent, who had murdered Barber, the free State man,
</p>
<p>on the 6th of December, 1855.
</p>
<p>' Under Shannon's instructions, United States Marshal Don
</p>
<p>aldson and Sheriff Jones, with a very large force of border
</p>
<p>ruffians, accompanied by artillery, made an assault on the
</p>
<p>town of Lawrence. The United States forces were not per
</p>
<p>mitted to move from their quarters, or take any part in the
</p>
<p>contest. Marshal Donaldson first entered the place with a
</p>
<p>posse, and arrested a number of persons for treason, and
</p>
<p>seized all the arms he could find. The inhabitants made no
</p>
<p>resistance to the United States officers. He then went through
</p>
<p>the mockery of disbanding his forces ; after which they were
</p>
<p>immediately led on by Sheriff Jones ; artillery was hauled
</p>
<p>up, and they opened with cannon on the Free State Hotel.
</p>
<p>This building was burned ; also the printing office of the
</p>
<p>Herald of Freedom, and other dwellings, were* entirely de
</p>
<p>stroyed by the torch and cannon in the hands of the pro-
</p>
<p>slavery mob. The loss of life by the indiscriminate firing of
</p>
<p>cannon in a populous city must have been frightful. Many
</p>
<p>of the members of the free State Legislature were arrested ;
</p>
<p>and Gov. Robinson was arrested at Lexington, Missouri, May
</p>
<p>21, 1856.
</p>
<p>The pro-slavery men now began to distrust Governor Shan
</p>
<p>non, and a new plan of continuing the strife .was resorted to 
</p>
<p>that of making raids from Missouri, by bands of from 100 to
</p>
<p>300 men, under different leaders, for the purpose of murder
</p>
<p>ing and driving out the Free State Men. This was not done
</p>
<p>as before, under cover, but in defiance of all law. Shannon
</p>
<p>became unable to control the pro-slavery element, and in the
</p>
<p>latter part of the summer of 1856 he resigned in disgust. A
</p>

<p>Kansas. When Shannon resigned, Daniel Woodson, a Virginian, whom '
</p>
<p>SLAVERY OUTRAGES IN KANSAS. 79
</p>
<p>Pierce had appointed Secretary of Kansas, officiated as Gov
</p>
<p>ernor until the arrival of Geary. The presidential election
</p>
<p>was near at hand ; and, at the solicitation of Buchanan, not
</p>
<p>only a new Governor, but a change of tactics in Kansas was
</p>
<p>deemed necessary to assist in the impending presidential
</p>
<p>struggle. Gen. Sumner, who was supposed to have sympathy
</p>
<p>for the free State men on account of his northern birth, was
</p>
<p>dismissed from command by Jeff. Davis, and Persifer F.
</p>
<p>Smith, a Louisiana slaveholder, appointed to take charge of
</p>
<p>the department of the West. In Davis's instructions to his
</p>
<p>new General, he remarks that "patriotism and humanity alike
</p>
<p>require that the rebellion shall be promptly crushed." Shortly
</p>
<p>after his arrival in the Territory, Geary, on the 12th of Sep
</p>
<p>tember, 1856, issued a proclamation, which was read aloud at
</p>
<p>Leavenworth to the assembled crowd by Mr. Adams. This
</p>
<p>proclamation demanded that all military organizations in the
</p>
<p>Territory (except the Federal forces) should disband. The
</p>
<p>change that had bee"n suggested by Buchanan was to sustain
</p>
<p>the pro-slavery party by acknowledging the validity of the
</p>
<p>laws passed by the bogus legislature, and sustain the pro-
</p>
<p>slavery judicials in their crusade against freedom by arrest
</p>
<p>ing free State men. To make the matter appear fair, all mil
</p>
<p>itary organizations had to be disbanded  border ruffians, as
</p>
<p>well as free State men. This was the scheme hit on by Bu
</p>
<p>chanan  to disarm the free State men, and render them power
</p>
<p>less for defence.
</p>
<p>Atchison, Reid and Titus had a border ruffian force then in
</p>
<p>'Kansas of 2,400 men, with four pieces of artillery. The Mis
</p>
<p>souri Platte Avgus at the time said : "Geary agreed to carry
</p>
<p>out wlvat the border ruffians wanted, if they would disband, and
</p>
<p>with that understanding they mar died out of the Territory.
</p>
<p>The record they left behind can only partially be given.
</p>
<p>They murdered Maj. Hoyt, of Lawrence, by breaking in his
</p>
<p>skull, and otherwise mutilating the body so as to render rec
</p>
<p>ognition almost impossible. One hundred of them ravished a

<p>mother and daughter during the absence of the husband
</p>
<p>and father at Kansas City. About the same time Mr. Hopp,
</p>
<p>80 SLAVERY OUTRAGES IN KANSAS.
</p>
<p>formerly of Rock Island, 111., while about three miles on hi9
</p>
<p>way from Lawrence to Leavenworth, was shot and scalped,
</p>
<p>and left dead in the road. They broke up the Quaker Mission
</p>
<p>at the Shawnee Reserve, where the Friends had a school
</p>
<p>educating a few Indians, plundering the place, and driving off
</p>
<p>the horses, while the Quakers were forced to flee for their
</p>
<p>lives. On Washington Creek, about seven miles from Law
</p>
<p>rence, they visited the house of Henry Hj'att, a native of
</p>
<p>Indiana. A young widow, a friend of the family, had accom
</p>
<p>panied them to their new home ; and in the evening of August
</p>
<p>20th, while she was passing from an out-house into the dwell
</p>
<p>ing, she was seized by a band of ruffians, who, before she
</p>
<p>could scream for aid, choked her tongue out of her mouth
</p>
<p>and tied it with a string behind her and round her neck, tell
</p>
<p>ing her if she made the least noise she would instantly be shot.
</p>
<p>They then tied her hands behind her back, and removed her
</p>
<p>to a patch of prairie grass, about 400 yards from the house,
</p>
<p>and after ravishing her in turn kicked her in the sides and
</p>
<p>abdomen, and left her (as they supposed) to die. On their
</p>
<p>way out of the Territory these pro-slavery ruffians, in passing
</p>
<p>the house of Mr. Buffum, who was just then harnessing up his
</p>
<p>horse, they demanded it. He explained to them that he had
</p>
<p>an aged father and mother, and a sister and brother that were
</p>
<p>blind and dumb, all depending on him for support. " You
</p>
<p>see," said he, "I also am myself a cripple." They immediately
</p>
<p>ripped out an oath that he was a "damned abolitionist," and
</p>
<p>shot him through the bowels. They then took his horse, leav
</p>
<p>ing him in such a condition that he died in about one hour.
</p>
<p>They sacked the town of Franklin, and scalped a man while
</p>
<p>alive, and exhibited his skinless head to his outraged friends.
</p>
<p>On the Missouri, above Leavenworth, the settlers at Kick-
</p>
<p>apoo, Atchison and Doniphan, irrespective of party, were
</p>
<p>plundered of all they possessed ; even the under garments of
</p>
<p>women and the children's clothes, were stripped from their
</p>
<p>bodies and carried off by the pro-slavery border-ruffian mob.

<p>Lecompton and Tecumseh, both strongholds of pro-slavery in
</p>
<p>Kansas, came in for a share of their lawless depredations.
</p>
<p>SLAVERY OUTRAGES IN KANSAS. 81
</p>
<p>In the meantime a force was collected at Lexington, on the
</p>
<p>Missouri river. This is a town in the State of Missouri where
</p>
<p>emigrants going to Kansas by water have to pass. All steam
</p>
<p>boats were compelled to stop here and submit to a search.
</p>
<p>If any free State persons were aboard, they were sent back ;
</p>
<p>if they had arms, they were taken from them. Thus no more
</p>
<p>free State emigrants were permitted to enter Kansas by the
</p>
<p>water route. Colonel Richardson, a Missourian, was also
</p>
<p>dispatched to the Nebraska line, with a force of 400 border
</p>
<p>ruffians to block up the land road, and prevent any free State
</p>
<p>settlers entering Kansas by that route. With all these ad
</p>
<p>vantages in favor of the pro-slavery party, success appeared
</p>
<p>inevitable. This was the situation on the 29th of September, 1856,
</p>
<p>when Governor Geary brought the Federal dragoons into the
</p>
<p>field. Clark, the murderer of Barber, (whom Ex-Governor
</p>
<p>Shannon had boarded with,) Col. Titus, Reid and Atchison
</p>
<p>were retained by Geary as his aids. Lane, the free State
</p>
<p>General, made his escape with a small force, with their arms,
</p>
<p>into Nebraska. Up to October 14, 1856, not one pro-slavery
</p>
<p>man had been arrested by Geary. All kinds of charges were
</p>
<p>made and indictments found against free State men, who were
</p>
<p>arrested by U. S. Marshal Donaldson, (although they never
</p>
<p>resisted Federal authority.) supported by the Federal army.
</p>
<p>Every hope of the free State party appeared, to the outside
</p>
<p>world, as crushed by the slave power wielding the Federal
</p>
<p>Government. Geary's rule was such that it compelled free
</p>
<p>State men to flee from the Territory for their lives. The
</p>
<p>slave State of Texas had voted $50,000 to assist the border
</p>
<p>ruffians to make Kansas a slave State, and large sums were
</p>
<p>sent from other slave States to the leaders of the pro slavery
</p>
<p>bands to encourage them to persevere in aiding the Federal
</p>
<p>Government to murder and drive out of the common terri
</p>
<p>tories all the settlers from the free States.
</p>
<p>The pro-slavery agitators in Congress were now anxious
</p>
<p>to lend their aid to the Federal Executive, in the shape of

</p>
<p>attaching to the army bill, authority to use the Federal army
</p>
<p>82 SLAVERY OUTRAGES IN KANSAS.
</p>
<p>to put down insurrection in Kansas ; which meant, to use it to
</p>
<p>butcher its free State settlers if they did not give their con
</p>
<p>sent that slavery should be supreme in the Federal territories.
</p>
<p>The army bill passed the House with the above clause at
</p>
<p>tached ; 80 Southern Representatives voted for it, and 21
</p>
<p>members from the free States  making 101 votes. The Sen
</p>
<p>ate refused to' pass it with that clause, by a vote of 25 to 7.
</p>
<p>It was struck out, and sent back to the House, and the bill
</p>
<p>was then passed with no proviso as to the employing of the
</p>
<p>army in Kansas.
</p>
<p>Some time in October, 1856, a train of emigrants under Mr.
</p>
<p>Eldridge, 250 in all, were met by Deputy Marshal Preston,
</p>
<p>with 700 troops and six pieces of artillery. He ordered the
</p>
<p>emigrants under arrest, and searched their baggage. They
</p>
<p>were mostly from New York, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wiscon
</p>
<p>sin and Iowa. They were all discharged by Gov. Geary on
</p>
<p>their arrival in Kansas, and their arms and baggage restored
</p>
<p>to them.
</p>
<p>Gov. Geary had arrived in time to witness Mr. Buffum die.
</p>
<p>He pledged him that he would bring his murderer to justice.
</p>
<p>A warrant was placed in the hands of Marshal Donaldson for
</p>
<p>the arrest of Hays, the murderer. He was arrested and
</p>
<p>brought before Judge Lecompte, who released him on bail,
</p>
<p>Sheriff Jones becoming his surety. This aggravated Gov.
</p>
<p>Geary, and he immediately offered a large reward for his re
</p>
<p>arrest. Donaldson refused to act, and swore he would resign.
</p>
<p>The Governor induced Col. Titus, who was one of his aids,
</p>
<p>to make the arrest. Titus, the most rabid of all, and the
</p>
<p>leader of the band of Southern thieves, was about to leave,
</p>
<p>with his two companies, to join Walker, in Nicaragua, and,
</p>
<p>for a large consideration from the Governor, he and his men,
</p>
<p>who had been kept as a kind of body-guard when all other
</p>
<p>militia was disbanded, made the arrest. Hays was this time
</p>
<p>brought before Judge Cato, who refused a writ of habeas
</p>
<p>corpus, and the criminal was sent to jail. This occurred on

<p>the 29th of November, and Titus left, with his two compa-
</p>
<p>7 nies, on the 1st of December. This act of simple justice on
</p>
<p>SLAVERY OUTRAGES IN KANSAS. 83
</p>
<p>the part of the Governor completely turned the pro-slavery
</p>
<p>officials of Kansas against him. They sent letters to the
</p>
<p>heads of department requesting his removal, and a perfect
</p>
<p>feud was got up between him and Judge Lecompte. This
</p>
<p>unprincipled judicial knave had just committed twenty free
</p>
<p>State men for manslaughter, and sent them to prison for five
</p>
<p>years. Such an act of judicial outrage was never before per
</p>
<p>petrated in the whole history of the country. Gov. Geary
</p>
<p>saw and felt it ; his better nature revolted against it, and
</p>
<p>they joined issue. He removed the Lecompte trials and or
</p>
<p>dered them before Judge Cato.
</p>
<p>On the 6th of January, 1857, several members of the free
</p>
<p>State Legislature met at Topeka. Sheriff Jones swore out,
</p>
<p>and Judge Cato issued the warrants, and the new Marshal,
</p>
<p>who was appointed to fill Donaldson's place, (Pardee,) made the
</p>
<p>arrests. The bogus pro-slavery Legislature met at Lecompton on
</p>
<p>January 15, 1857. Gov. Geary advised the Legislature to re
</p>
<p>peal some of the obnoxious laws, and let slavery alone until a
</p>
<p>Constitution was adopted. Not a single officer in the Terri
</p>
<p>tory was amenable to the people or to the Governor ; they all
</p>
<p>held their offices by appointment of the bogus Legislature.
</p>
<p>On the 17th of February, 1857, a bill was framed and passed
</p>
<p>by this infamous Legislature to assist Hays, and other pro-
</p>
<p>slavery murderers to give bail and escape justice. The Gov
</p>
<p>ernor vetoed it ; but the Legislature passed it over his head
</p>
<p>by only one dissenting vote. After it was passed, Clark,
</p>
<p>(whom Gov. Shannon, and Sheriff Jones had boarded with,)
</p>
<p>the murderer of Barber, gave himself up, and entered bail to
</p>
<p>appear. The Governor had also vetoed the bill providing for
</p>
<p>a Constitutional Convention, because it did not provide that
</p>
<p>the Constitution should be submitted to the people. The
</p>
<p>bogus Legislature passed it over his head. Geary had en
</p>
<p>tirely lost his influence over the Legislature, and the Conven
</p>
<p>tion that assembled to form a pro-slavery Constitution looked
</p>
<p>on him with distrust. i

<p>Judge Lecompte wrote a letter to Attorney General Cush-
</p>
<p>84 SLAVERY OUTRAGES IN KANSAS.
</p>
<p>ing, dated Jan. 9th, 1857, stating that he regarded Geary's
</p>
<p>advent into Kansas as " a woful curse to the Territory." Also
</p>
<p>a large party of South Carolinians, who had gone to help
</p>
<p>make Kansas a slave State, left for home ; passing through
</p>
<p>Washington about the first of the month, they remarked that
</p>
<p>they were " completely disgusted with Geary and Kansas."

<p>The Legislature appointed one Sherrard to fill the place of
</p>
<p>Sheriff Jones, resigned. He being an outlaw and a drunkard,
</p>
<p>the Governor refused to commission him. He secretly way
</p>
<p>laid the Governor, and in order to get him into combat, so as
</p>
<p>to have an excuse to assassinate him, spit in Geary's face.
</p>
<p>The Governor exerted himself to get up an indignation meet
</p>
<p>ing at Lecompton. Sherrard attended the meeting, pistol in
</p>
<p>hand, and after wounding three persons was himself shot
</p>
<p>dead by a young man attached to the Governor's suit. Geary,
</p>
<p>hearing that there was a plot to assassinate him, ordered
</p>
<p>out a regiment of United States infantry stationed in the
</p>
<p>town, and sent to Tecumseh for the dragoons who were em
</p>
<p>ployed there to guard the prisoners, but it was found that
</p>
<p>all the ferry boats had been set adrift, and there was no way
</p>
<p>of passing over the troops. He then called out a number of
</p>
<p>citizens for his defence. The bogus Legislature had justified
</p>
<p>the act of spitting in his face. The Governor becoming sat
</p>
<p>isfied that his life would be taken if he remained in the Ter
</p>
<p>ritory, resigned about the middle of March, 1857.
</p>
<p>The officers of the United States army under Gen. Smith,
</p>
<p>when that Louisiana slaveholder found the Governor would
</p>
<p>not go all lengths to sustain slavery, also turned against him.
</p>
<p>In his farewell address, the Governor says : " I have been
</p>
<p>refused a detachment of two companies, with the taunting
</p>
<p>reply that ' The United States army is not here to protect
</p>
<p>you? A band of fifty men have been organized, ever since I
</p>

</p>
<p>Thus ended the administration of Gov. Geary in Kansas.

</p>
<p>He was selected by Pierce, at Buchanan's solicitation, to go
</p>
<p>into Kansas to quiet the excitement, in order to assist in
</p>
<p>the presidential canvass of the fall of that year, 1856. The
</p>
<p>fraudulent voting, the arming of the border ruffian militia
</p>
<p>under the form of law, and the raids, in defiance of all law,
</p>
<p>of from 100 to 300 Missourians into Kansas to murder the
</p>
<p>free State men, all having failed, Geary went out to disband
</p>
<p>all the above auxiliaries, and bring the Federal forces into
</p>
<p>the field, to make a show of a peaceful settlement of the diffi
</p>
<p>culties, in order that Buchanan might not be defeated. The
</p>
<p>election was carried by the pro-slavery party, under the ban
</p>
<p>ner of State Rights, and slavery in the Territories to be re
</p>
<p>jected or established by the residents themselves without any
</p>
<p>outside interference. Stripped of all mask, this doctrine is,
</p>
<p>that a State has power above the General Government ; and
</p>
<p>slavery is above the control of any act that Congress might
</p>
<p>pass. In this election the democratic party became entirely
</p>
<p>sectional, and their ticket was elected on a platform that
</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson would have spurned, and Andrew Jackson
</p>
<p>spit upon.
</p>
<p>A resolution was passed in the Buchanan Cincinnati Con
</p>
<p>vention, endorsing the Administration of Pierce. This was
</p>
<p>for the Southern pro-slavery eye. It was excluded from the
</p>
<p>platform, and few of the Northern Democratic journals ever
</p>
<p>published it, and no one of them ever endorsed it. So much
</p>
<p>for the fork-tongued, cheating convention, that nominated
</p>
<p>Jim Buchanan, a worse traitor than Benedict Arnold. By
</p>
<p>this double dealing they secured for him 1,800,000 votes. Fre
</p>
<p>mont, his opponent, received 1,275,000. In the free .States
</p>
<p>alone, Fremont exceeded him 130,000. Add Fillmore's, the
</p>
<p>Know Nothing candidate's vote, 890,000, to Fremont's, and it
</p>
<p>leaves the old traitor 325,000 votes in the minority.
</p>
<p>What Raynor Kenneth, of North Carolina, a Fillmore Na

<p>a speech delivered in Philadelphia, Nov. 1st. 1856. He re

</p>
<p>agreed to present as their candidate. If he be elected, at the
</p>
<p>end of four years more, they will spring upon you another
</p>
<p>question of slavery agitation."
</p>
<p>Pierce's sectional pro-slavery administration had made more
</p>
<p>anti-slavery men than the lecturers and newspapers of that
</p>
<p>party had done for twenty-five years. Buchanan, as was ex
</p>
<p>pected, carried all the slave States ; add to them New Jersey,
</p>
<p>Indiana, Illinois, and his own State, Pennsylvania, which to
</p>
<p>gether gave him 174 electoralvotes. There being uo separate
</p>
<p>anti-slavery candidate, as heretofore, Fremont carried the
</p>
<p>great States of New York and Ohio, and nine other free
</p>
<p>States, making 113 electoral votes in all. Unlucky Fillmore,
</p>
<p>or the Native American Candidate, carried only Maryland.
</p>
<p>The anti-slavery converts made by Pierce's administration in
</p>
<p>creased from 152,296 in 1852 to 1,275,000 in 1856. The trai
</p>
<p>tor was about sixty -five years old when elected.
</p>
<p>Not only did the South claim that the Territories belonging
</p>
<p>to the Federal Government were all open to the introduction
</p>
<p>of slavery, but they desired the annexation of Cuba ; and
</p>
<p>Pierce, in all haste, set about to procure it, and solicited the
</p>
<p>aid of James Buchanan, then Minister to England, and J. Y.
</p>
<p>Mason, then Minister to France, to assist our Spanish Minis
</p>
<p>ter, Pierre Soule, to negotiate at Madrid. In a letter to Mr.
</p>
<p>Soule headed, " Department of State, Washington, August
</p>
<p>16th, 1854," Secretary Marcy says : " Sir, I am directed by
</p>
<p>the President to request that you call a meeting of three
</p>
<p>ministers, to meet at Paris, to consult on the best measures to
</p>
<p>adopt in your negotiations at Madrid."
</p>
<p>This meeting was held, but not at the place suggested by
</p>
<p>Pierce, but in Belgium and Prussia. We make a few extracts
</p>
<p>from the letter of reply, dated at

</p>
<p>After enumerating the immense advantage that would ac

<p>" Indeed, the Union can never enjoy repose or possess reliable

<p>PIERRE SOULE,"
</p>
<p>That part of Pierce's administration, to procure more slave
</p>
<p>territory at the hazard of a war with Spain, was only rendered
</p>
<p>more odious by its being notoriously known that the admin
</p>
<p>istration was secretly encouraging the getting up of hostile
</p>
<p>expeditions to invade Cuba, and, to blind the public, on the
</p>
<p>8th of December, 1855, issued a proclamation to prevent it.
</p>
<p>Gen. Wm. Walker, of Scottish descent, but a native of Ten
</p>
<p>nessee, was now struggling to become master of Central
</p>
<p>America. He had already fought the battles of Rivas, Souci,
</p>
<p>Virgin Bay, and Granada, but was compelled to fight a second
</p>
<p>battle at Rivas on the 11th of April, 1856. In this fight he
</p>
<p>was victorious, but with severe loss. Don Patricio Rivas was
</p>
<p>Walker's President of Nicaragua. His proclamation, pre
</p>
<p>viously issued, had been received with some favor by Guate
</p>
<p>mala, Honduras, and San Salvador. The object of Walker's
</p>
<p>first expedition to Sonora, according to his own statement,
</p>
<p>was to develope the resources of Lower California, and to
</p>
<p>effect a perfect social organization therein ; and to this he said
</p>
<p>it was necessary to make it independent. In his brief hour

<p>of presidential authority, after declaring independence of
</p>
<p>88 SLAVERY OUTRAGES IN KANSAS.
</p>
<p>Mexico, his second decree was, extending the laws of the
</p>
<p>slave State of Louisiana- over the Republic of Sonora. This
</p>
<p>was his record that induced the administration of Pierce to
</p>
<p>recognize and encourage him in his new field of operations.
</p>
<p>After Walker's Minister had been recognized at Washington,
</p>
<p>the administration authorized a meeting to be held, on the
</p>
<p>23d of May, 1856, in the city of New York. Lewis Cass
</p>
<p>wrote a letter to be read at this meeting ; he says : " My feel
</p>
<p>ings and sympathies are with you in the demonstration of
</p>
<p>public satisfaction at the wise and just measure of the admin
</p>
<p>istration, by which the existing Government of Nicaragua is
</p>
<p>recognized, and will be encouraged to go on in its good
</p>
<p>work." Add to this Marcy's threatening letter about the
</p>
<p>same time to Louis. Molina, Charge d' Affaires of Costa Rica.
</p>
<p>That Government was hostile to Walker and his adventurers,
</p>
<p>and Secretary Marcy gives its Minister to understand that
</p>
<p>such hostility was viewed as indirectly against the, United
</p>
<p>States Government.
</p>
<p>The Washington Daily Union, from the 27th of December
</p>
<p>to the 14th of March, had accounts of six different expedi
</p>
<p>tions on their way to join Walker. Meetings were held in
</p>
<p>New Orleans, Mobile, Charleston, Nashville, and almost every
</p>
<p>other Southern town of note, endorsing the action of the ad
</p>
<p>ministration, and encouraging it and Walker to persevere in
</p>
<p>the good work in which they were jointly engaged. Colonel
</p>
<p>Titus, who, with two companies, had been sent by Florida to
</p>
<p>assist in driving the free State men out of Kansas, was in
</p>
<p>duced by the administration to start with his force to the as
</p>
<p>sistance of Walker, in Nicaragua. He left Kansas on the 1st of
</p>
<p>December, 1856, at tbe secret solicitation of the administra
</p>
<p>tion to assist the South, under Walker, in acquiring more
</p>
<p>slave territory in Central America.
</p>
<p>This sectional administration of the Man of Sin was now
</p>
<p>coming to a close. In the brief time of four years itjiad ful
</p>
<p>filled every prediction of the anti-slavery men of the North,

<p>and completely corrupted the fountains of the democratic
</p>
<p>element, and used the prestige of that great party to over-
</p>
<p>SLAVERY OUTRAGES IN KANSAS. 89
</p>
<p>throw its long cherished principles established by Jefferson,
</p>
<p>Jackson and Polk. His administration was managed exclu
</p>
<p>sively by the disciples of Calhoun ; they annulled the doc
</p>
<p>trine that Congress had power over slavery in the Territories
</p>
<p>by repealing the Missouri Compromise of 1820, by which
</p>
<p>they opened all the Federal territory to the. introduction of
</p>
<p>slavery. They sent armed assassins from the slave States
</p>
<p>into Kansas to force slavery into that Territory, against the
</p>
<p>expressed will of a great majority of its actual settlers, a de
</p>
<p>tailed account of which we have already given. They were
</p>
<p>plotting to acquire the island of Cuba, at the hazard of a war
</p>
<p>with Spain. They allied themselves with and encouraged
</p>
<p>Walker in his disreputable and subsequent disastrous fail
</p>
<p>ure to extend slavery into Central America. They perverted
</p>
<p>justice, by influencing the Supreme Court to join in their un
</p>
<p>holy pro-slavery crusade, and compelled Judge Taney to keep
</p>
<p>secret his unrighteous decision in the Dred Scott case until
</p>
<p>after the presidential election  he holding it in his pocket
</p>
<p>over six months  that their new candidate (Buchanan) might
</p>
<p>not be defeated by its promulgation. After the desirable ob
</p>
<p>ject had been accomplished it was made public, March.6th,
</p>
<p>1857, two days after Buchanan's inauguration.
</p>
<p>To provide against Buchanan's defeat by Fremont, the ad
</p>
<p>ministration had arranged, according to a previously required
</p>
<p>pledge, to betray the United States Government into the
</p>
<p>hands of the ultra pro-slavery men of the Southern States.
</p>
<p>The proof of this can be found in the Washington corres
</p>
<p>pondence of the New Orleans Delta, dated Sep\ 10th, 1856,
</p>
<p>which says : " If Fremont is elected, Virginia, Georgia and
</p>
<p>South Carolina will immediately withdraw from the Union,
</p>
<p>before Fremont can get hold of the army and navy or purse-
</p>
<p>strings of the Government. Wise, of Virginia, is actively at
</p>
<p>work, and the South can rely on President Pierce in the emer
</p>
<p>gency contemplated."
</p>
<p>Buchanan now began to arrange for the presidential term

<p>for which he had been elected. The ultra pro-slavery men of
</p>
<p>the South determined to control or kill him. They expected

<p>90 POISONING OP PRESIDENT BUCHANAN.
</p>
<p>he would be the last President that the pro-slavery party
</p>
<p>could ever eleGt, and they were determined to have four years
</p>
<p>exolusive control, so as to disarm the Federal Government.
</p>
<p>Pierce stood ready, if Fremont had been elected, in 1856, to
</p>
<p>betray his country. Buchanan might be sure, but Breckin
</p>
<p>ridge they knew to be safe. Like Butler, Gordon and Leslie,
</p>
<p>of Wallenstein memory, they resolved to take the life of their
</p>
<p>leader. Who acted the part of Capt. Devereux, in attempt
</p>
<p>ing to assassinate Buchanan, we know not.
</p>
<p>THE ATTEMPT TO MURDER PRESIDENT BUCHANAN.
</p>
<p>Presidents Harrison and Taylor had been singly assassin
</p>
<p>ated. The first had been dispatched with such perfect suc
</p>
<p>cess, and a period of ten years having nearly elapsed, and no
</p>
<p>arrests having been made, it was thought safe to apply the
</p>
<p>same means to destroy President Taylor. Although the first
</p>
<p>had twice succeeded without detection, still a repetition for
</p>
<p>a third time of poisoning a President during the early part of
</p>
<p>his term of office, and amid high political excitement, it was
</p>
<p>thought would be surrounded with evidence of foul play, and
</p>
<p>thus lead to detection.
</p>
<p>Therefore, to prevent suspicion and investigation, a change
</p>
<p>of tactics was determined upon. Instead of the President
</p>
<p>(as heretofore) being the only victim, it was so arranged that
</p>
<p>from twenty to fifty persons were to lose their lives, and
</p>
<p>among them President Buchanan. It would thus appear as an
</p>
<p>accidental occurrence.
</p>
<p>Every effort had in each case been made to use the Chief
</p>
<p>Magistrate exclusively for the slave interest, and only when
</p>
<p>these efforts had failed was murder used to secure victory.
</p>
<p>The slave interest was led to believe, by Buchanan's political
</p>
<p>life, and by intimations from the old public functionary him
</p>
<p>self, that his administration would be rigidly pro-slavery. The
</p>
<p>Kansas troubles were at their height. Through the repeal
</p>
<p>of the Missouri Compromise, slavery had a chance in that
</p>
<p>territory, and Jefferson Davis, and Hunter, of Virginia, and

<p>Toombs, of Georgia, with other disciples of Calhoun, were

<p>POISONING OP PRESIDENT BUCHANAN. 91
</p>
<p>determined to rule and direct the incoming administration.
</p>
<p>Every effort was resorted to for the purpose of compelling
</p>
<p>Buchanan to make up his Cabinet from the pro-slavery, dis
</p>
<p>union Southern element. The old gentleman became very stiff
</p>
<p>in the back after his election, and began to think he was
</p>
<p>his own master; the country appeared to him to have a
</p>
<p>Northern as well as a Southern interest, and he refused to
</p>
<p>be controlled.
</p>
<p>He visited Washington in the latter part of February, and
</p>
<p>put up, as usual, at the National Hotel. On Sunday, the 22d
</p>
<p>day of February, it became generally known that he had set
</p>
<p>his face strongly against the Jeff. Davis, pro-slavery rule or
</p>
<p>ruin party. It was given out that Lewis Cass, of Michigan,
</p>
<p>and Howell Cobb, of Georgia, were to have the leading po
</p>
<p>sitions in his Cabinet.
</p>
<p>" He had also promised to settle the question of the freedom
</p>
<p>of the territories to the satisfaction of the people of the free
</p>
<p>States."  New York Eve. Post.
</p>
<p>" The appointment of Cass and Cobb to the two command
</p>
<p>ing positions in the Cabinet strikes the secessionists between
</p>
<p>wind and water, and is equivalent to a practical and absolute
</p>
<p>repudiation of the border-ruffian, Kansas, negro-agitation,
</p>
<p>disunion policy of Pierce."  New- York Herald, Feb. 22, 1857.
</p>
<p>The Herald of the 26th says : " The appointments, by the
</p>
<p>Jefferson Davis faction, will doubtless be accepted and treated
</p>
<p>as a declaration qf war, and as a war qf extermination on one
</p>
<p>side or the other." ' \
</p>
<p>On the 22d, Buchanan's determination became known ; and
</p>
<p>on the 23d of February, 1857, (next day,) he was poisoned. The
</p>
<p>plot was deep, and planned with skill. Mr. Buchanan, as is
</p>
<p>customary with men in his station, had a table, or chairs, re
</p>
<p>served for him and his friends. The President was known to
</p>
<p>be an inveterate tea-drinker ; in fact, Northern people rarely
</p>
<p>drink anything else in the evening. Southern men mostly
</p>
<p>prefer coffee. Thus, to make sure of Buchanan, and cause as

<p>in the sugar bowls containing the tea or lump sugar, and set <

</p>
<p>on the table where he was to sit. The pulverized sugar used
</p>
<p>for coffee setting on the table was kept free from the poison
</p>
<p>ous drug by deep-laid strategy ; thus, not a single Southern
</p>
<p>man was affected. Fifty or sixty persons dined at different
</p>
<p>intervals at that table that evening ; and as near as we can
</p>
<p>ascertain about thirty-eight died from the effects of the poison.
</p>
<p>Mr. Buchanan was poisoned, and with great difficulty pre
</p>
<p>served his life. Hisphysician treated him under standingly, from
</p>
<p>instructions given by himself as to the cause of his disease, for he
</p>
<p>understood well what was the matter. We make the above state

<p>ment from the higliest authority, and as to the material facts we
</p>
<p>feel confident that the Ex-President, although not our author, wiU
</p>
<p>not contradict them.
</p>
<p>Shortly after the occurrence, the Cincinnati Commercial
</p>
<p>had an article headed as follows :
</p>
<p>"Poisoning the President.  Mr. Buchanan, it is well known,

<p>from a private letter : ' As I was passing a gas light I saw a

<p>POISONING OF PRESIDENT BUCHANAN. 93
</p>
<p>" Since the appearance of the epidemic the tables of the
</p>
<p>National Hotel have been almost empty. But more remark
</p>
<p>able than the appearance of the mysterious epidemic itself, is
</p>
<p>the supineness of the Washington authorities in regard to it.
</p>
<p>Have the proprietors of the hotel, or clerks or servants suf
</p>
<p>fered from this disease ? If not, in what respect has their
</p>
<p>diet and accommodations differed from those of the guests.
</p>
<p>There is more in this calamity than meets the eye. It is not
</p>
<p>a matter to be trifled with."  New York Post, March 18, 1857.
</p>
<p>Those having a hand in the foul crime, in order to delude
</p>
<p>investigation, said the disease resulted from the water in the
</p>
<p>cistern, into which a number of rats that had been poisoned
</p>
<p>with arsenic had plunged. The Board of Health met on the
</p>
<p>evening of March 16th. The sewerage of the establishment
</p>
<p>was pointed to and observed. All the drains, it appears, were
</p>
<p>south, and southern winds were supposed to have an effect.
</p>
<p>But how, it may be asked, did a cause which existed for so
</p>
<p>long a time only .begin to produce a fatal effect immediately
</p>
<p>on the arrival of President Buchanan in Washington ? The
</p>
<p>South Side Democrat, Petersburg, Va.. says: "Is boasted
</p>
<p>modern science so completely in the dark that it cannot de
</p>
<p>tect the difference of effect between mephitic air and arsenic?"
</p>
<p>Symptoms of the attack, and Names of some of the Murdered
</p>
<p>Diad.  A persistent diarrhea, in some cases accompanied with
</p>
<p>violent vomiting, and always with a most depressing loss of
</p>
<p>strength and spirits in the person. Sometimes for one day
</p>
<p>the patients would be filled with hopes of recovery, then re
</p>
<p>lapse back again into loss of spirits and illness.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lenox, of Ohio, died on his way home from Washing
</p>
<p>ton. He was a guest at the National at the time of the oc
</p>
<p>currence. Mrs. J. L. Adams, of New York city, also died from the
</p>
<p>effects of this disease. " A post-mortem examination of Mrs.
</p>
<p>Adams revealed the fact that the stomach had been partly
</p>
<p>eaten away by arsenic."  See New York Post, March 14, 1857.

</p>
<p>had been at the National Hotel at the time. Mr. Johnston
</p>
<p>and the daughter were also severely afflicted, but recovered.
</p>
<p> Newark Advertiser, April 16th, 1857.
</p>
<p>Elliott Eskridge, Mr. Buchanan's nephew, was believed to
</p>
<p>have died from the same cause.
</p>
<p>The following individuals were also poisoned at the time,
</p>
<p>"but recovered : Hon. Robert B. Hall, member of Congress
</p>
<p>from Massachusetts ; Hon. 0. B. Matteson, of New York
</p>
<p>State ; Benj. F. Butler, (now Brigadier General,) of Mass. ;
</p>
<p>John Appleton, editor of the Union, Washington, D. C. ; J.
</p>
<p>Glancy Jones, of Pennsylvania ; Samuel Medary, of Colum
</p>
<p>bus, Ohio ; Wilson G. Hunt, G. Gifford, and Marshal Hillyer,
</p>
<p>all of the city of New York. The latter gentleman's physi
</p>
<p>cians detected arsenic in the contents of his stomach.
</p>
<p>Intimidated by the attempted assassination, Buchanan be
</p>
<p>came more than ever the tool of the slave power. He now,
</p>
<p>in conversation with Southern ultras, boastingly remarked.
</p>
<p>that, " in tlve repeal of the Missouri Compromise the South, for
</p>
<p>the first time in the history of our Government, had obtained its
</p>
<p>rights." So wrote the correspondent of the Huntsville (Ala.)
</p>
<p>Democrat. Gov. Geary explained fully to the President the true con
</p>
<p>dition of Kansas, and offered to return, if he would furnish him
</p>
<p>the military required to protect him against the border ruf
</p>
<p>fians. Clark, Calhoun and Whitfield were now in Washington,
</p>
<p>demanding Geary's removal. It now became known that Mc
</p>
<p>Lane, chief clerk of the surveyors office in Kansas, had in
</p>
<p>tercepted, read and destroyed two bushels of letters going
</p>
<p>from and directed to Gov. Geary. The contents of some of
</p>
<p>the intercepted letters were communicated to the leaders
</p>
<p>of the pro-slavery party, and as many of these epistles bitr
</p>
<p>terly denounced them, it was a miracle that he ever came
</p>
<p>out of the Territory alive.
</p>
<p>Buchanan commenced his administration in Kansas affairs
</p>
<p>as though the entire territories of the United States belonged
</p>
<p>exclusively to the slave drivers. Lecompte was retained as f

<p>Judge, and Whitfield, Emery, Woodson and Anson were also

</p>
<p>kept in office. Thus the judiciary, land officers, public sur
</p>
<p>veyors and marshals were all of the same stripe. Robert J.
</p>
<p>Walker, formerly of Mississippi, was appointed Governor,
</p>
<p>and another desperate effort made to force slavery into Kan
</p>
<p>sas. All the power asked for by Geary was readily promised
</p>
<p>to Walker. Buchanan, through his Secretary, Fred. P. Stan
</p>
<p>ton, of Kentuck}-, in an address published in the Lecompton
</p>
<p>Union, the latter part of April, 1857, says that the " adminis
</p>
<p>tration has recognized tlve authority of the territorial Legisla
</p>
<p>ture, and the validity of the territorial laws, (one law of which
</p>
<p>was that rebellion against territorial law was punishable with
</p>
<p>death,) and has especially recognized the act providing for a Con
</p>
<p>stitutional Convention." "
</p>
<p>Gov. Walker arrived in the Territory the last of May. On
</p>
<p>the 3d* of June, in his inaugural, he remarks that " the terri
</p>
<p>torial enactments must be obeyed, and he wishes all parties
</p>
<p>to take part in the elections, and hopes that the Constitution
</p>
<p>will be submitted to the people." He was willing to sustain
</p>
<p>the pro-slavery party in enforcing obedience to the laws
</p>
<p>passed by the bogus territorial Legislature of 1855. He pro
</p>
<p>claimed that he would use the United States troops to pre
</p>
<p>vent illegal voting at the polls ; but when told that Missou
</p>
<p>rians were coming over to vote, he refused to send troops to
</p>
<p>the exposed border. He had also procured writs against forty
</p>
<p>or fifty persons who had been voted for to serve under the
</p>
<p>charter of the city of Lawrence. Old Ex-Governor Shannon
</p>
<p>laughed at this, but he did not understand that it was a poor
</p>
<p>political bone that Walker deemed necessary to throw to the
</p>
<p>hungry slave power.
</p>
<p>The Governor took the stump, and everywhere in the Ter
</p>
<p>ritory urged on the pro-slavery party the importance of grant
</p>
<p>ing to the actual settlers of Kansas a fair chance to vote, and
</p>
<p>also strongly recommended that the Constitution should be
</p>
<p>submitted to a* direct vote of the people. Although exter
</p>
<p>nally appearing to act for the interest of slavery, his policy

<p>concerning the election, and his well known liberal views
</p>
<p>about submitting the Constitution, when drafted by the Con-
</p>
<p>96 SLAVERY OUTRAGES IN KANSAS.
</p>
<p>vention, to the approval of the people, divided the pro-slavery
</p>
<p>party. A great number of the rank and file sided with the
</p>
<p>Governor, while the leaders of the party combined against
</p>
<p>him. Mr. Perrin, Walker's private Secretary, in a letter to
</p>
<p>the New York Times, dated Lecompton, June 3d, 1857, says :
</p>
<p>" A middle party has sprung up, who will vote with the free
</p>
<p>State party, and there is no doubt but with this party the
</p>
<p>settlement of the Kansas question must eventually rest."
</p>
<p>Senator Wilson, of Mass., was in Kansas in the latter part
</p>
<p>of May and fore part of June, 1857. He and Walker some
</p>
<p>times spoke, one after the other, from the same platform.
</p>
<p>The Lecompton Constitutional Convention, elected under
</p>
<p>Gov. Walker, Sept. 12, 1867, refused to admit the free State
</p>
<p>delegates. Gov. Robinson (free State) had been tried for
</p>
<p>treason, August 21, by Judge Cato, who charged the jury
</p>
<p>strongly against him, but they brought in a verdict of Not
</p>
<p>Guilty. Nearly every officer appointed by Buchanan, except
</p>
<p>Walker and Stanton, had committed, aided and encouraged
</p>
<p>murder in Kansas.
</p>
<p>Although Walker refused to send troops to protect the
</p>
<p>polls on the Kansas border, the free State men were delighted
</p>
<p>when he threw out the fraudulent returns sent in from Johns
</p>
<p>ton and Magee counties. This act of justice, so faithfully done
</p>
<p>by him, was bitterly censured and condemned in a letter to
</p>
<p>him from Buchanan. The administration was now bearing hard
</p>
<p>down on Walker. The Neiv York Day Book, a pro-slavery
</p>
<p>sheet, demanded his removal, because he had forfeited the
</p>
<p>good opinion of the Democracy of the Territory. Buchanan,
</p>
<p>in his message of December 8th, 1857, came out against him.
</p>
<p>Senator Stephen A. Douglas, the Chicago Times, and Philadel
</p>
<p>phia Press were among his defenders. Walker became dis
</p>
<p>gusted, and resigned. His resignation was accepted by Gen.
</p>
<p>Cass, December 18th, 1857.
</p>
<p>On the day previous the bogus Legislature had agreed to
</p>
<p>submit the- Lecompton Constitution to a vote of the people.

</p>
<p>Although this pro-slavery document had been in existence
</p>
<p>since September, no one (not even Gov. Walker) had been
</p>
<p>permitted to see it.
</p>
<p>SLAVERY OUTRAGES IN KANSAS. 97
</p>
<p>The Kansas Legislature was composed of 13 free State men
</p>
<p>and 6 democrats in the Senate, and 29 free State men and 15
</p>
<p>Democrats in the House.
</p>
<p>Gov. Denver was next appointed to fill Walker's place. The
</p>
<p>free State element had now become so powerful that Gen.
</p>
<p>Lane was making numerous arrests for illegal voting. The
</p>
<p>Lecompton Constitution was repudiated by several thousands
</p>
<p>of. the popular vote. This news of defeat set hard on the
</p>
<p>pro-slavery party. In Congress, Keitt, of South Carolina,
</p>
<p>grabbed Mr. Grow, member of the House from Pennsylvania,
</p>
<p>by the throat. The latter knocked him down, remarking at
</p>
<p>the same time, that " no negro-driver should crack his slave
</p>
<p>whip over him." This occurred, Feb. 6th, 1858, and produced
</p>
<p>a general row in the House, which was difficult to quell.
</p>
<p>Buchanan, chagrined at Walker's failure in Kansas, re
</p>
<p>marked, after he' had sent his Kansas message into Congress,
</p>
<p>Feb. 2d, 1858, that "he would carry Lecompton through in
</p>
<p>sixty days or die."
</p>
<p>The free State men were not only getting strong, but bold.
</p>
<p>Gov. Denver issued a proclamation against arming the militia ;
</p>
<p>yet Gen. Lane kept on arming, and stigmatized Denver as a
</p>
<p>perjurer, calumniator and tyrant. This was in March, 1858.
</p>
<p>The object of arming the militia was, if the Lecompton Con
</p>
<p>stitution passed Congress, to make it impossible to organize
</p>
<p>any Government under it. On the 27th of March, 1858, per
</p>
<p>sons pretending to be officers of the United States army, in
</p>
<p>search of deserters, went in the dead of night to the house of
</p>
<p>Isaac Denton, on the Osage river. Mr. Denton rose from his
</p>
<p>bed and let the pro-slavery ruffians in, when he was imme
</p>
<p>diately shot dead. Mr. Hedric and Mr. Davis, his neighbors,
</p>
<p>were also on the same night murdered in the same manner.
</p>
<p>On the SOth of the same month a Constitutional Conven
</p>
<p>tion was sitting at Leavenworth. The Convention drew up a
</p>
<p>remonstrance addressed to the President, Congress, and the
</p>
<p>Legislatures of the different States. This instrument set

<p>the people of Kansas ; 2d, that it had been condemned by

</p>
<p>them. It was signed by Winchell, Thacher, Emery, Walden
</p>
<p>and Foster. Ex-Gov. Walker, after reading this remonstrance,
</p>
<p>in a letter to S. S. Cox, said, "If the Lecompton bill now
</p>
<p>pending in Congress pass, the odious Lecompton Constitution,
</p>
<p>born in fraud, and baptized in forgery and perjury, will be
</p>
<p>defeated by an overwhelming vote by the people of Kansas."
</p>
<p>Secretary Stanton, in a letter about the same date, said : "The
</p>
<p>Constitution has once been rejected by the people of Kansas,
</p>
<p>and why does Congress wish to send it back again to be re
</p>
<p>pudiated." Persifer F. Smith, the pro-slavery commander sent out by ,
</p>
<p>Jeff. Davis, under Pierce's administration, to supersede Gen. '
</p>
<p>Sumner, died at Leavenworth, May 16, 1858. Only three days
</p>
<p>after, as though hell had been reinforced, Capt. Hamilton, a Mis-
</p>
<p>sourian, with 25 armed ruffians, 17 of whom were from Mis
</p>
<p>souri and 8 from Kansas, captured 11 free State men in the
</p>
<p>southern part of Kansas, and at a ravine near Fort Hamilton,
</p>
<p>placed them in a row standing, when he ordered his men to
</p>
<p>take aim and fire. They all fell at tbe first discharge ; five were
</p>
<p>instantly killed, and five severely wounded. The murderers
</p>
<p>then went up and began to rifle their pockets. Finding one
</p>
<p>still unhurt, the Captain placed his pistol to his ear and put
</p>
<p>the ball through his head. One of the men, who had been
</p>
<p>slightly wounded, was overlooked in their great haste to
</p>
<p>escape ; he worked his way back to the post and told the sad
</p>
<p>news. Many of these ruffians were personally acquainted
</p>
<p>with their victims, and murdered them because they were
</p>
<p>free State men. Campbell, Colpetzer, Ross, Stilman and Rob
</p>
<p>inson, were some of the dead. Reed, a baptist preacher, Hall
</p>
<p>and Hargraves, (father and son,) were among the severely
</p>
<p>wounded. The names of the others we could not procure.
</p>
<p>To prevent the repetition of these outrages, the free State
</p>
<p>party encouraged Capt. Montgomery to organize a sufficient
</p>
<p>force, with which he afterwards frequently made excursions
</p>
<p>into Missouri. In a little speech, this free State Captain said,
</p>
<p>" he made no war on peaceable citizens, be they pro-slavery or

</p>
<p>murdering peaceful citizens ; neither did he allow any of his
</p>
<p>men to insult a woman."
</p>
<p>Gov. Denver accomplished very little during his term of
</p>
<p>office. He made a treaty of peace similar to that of Shannon,
</p>
<p>but the pro-slavery party broke it by commencing indiscrim
</p>
<p>inately to murder the people of Fort Scott. He resigned Sept.
</p>
<p>21,1858. Buchanan-, determined to make Kansas a slave State, al
</p>
<p>though so often defeated, was resolved to make one more
</p>
<p>effort. On the 12th of November, 1858, he appointed Samuel
</p>
<p>Medary, formerly Editor of the Ohio Statesman, and more
</p>
<p>recently Ex-Governor of Minnesota Territory. His instruc
</p>
<p>tions were to prevent Kansas from sending a Constitution
</p>
<p>into Congress that winter, if possible.
</p>
<p>A few persons said, and a great many believed, that the
</p>
<p>pro-slavery murderer, Capt. Hamilton, was instructed from
</p>
<p>Washington to commit his depredations in order that a plau
</p>
<p>sible excuse could be had for making another military effort
</p>
<p>to subdue the free State men. One thing is certain, Medary
</p>
<p>had scarcely got warm in his seat when Hamilton charged
</p>
<p>the people of southern Kansas with stealing negroes. Mr.
</p>
<p>Bailey, and several other free State men, were murdered in
</p>
<p>December, and Medary made a requisition on the President
</p>
<p>for military aid.
</p>
<p>Medary endeavored to do away with the expressive names
</p>
<p>of pro-slavery and free State men, and introduce the good old
</p>
<p>titles of Democrats and Republicans. He thought the name
</p>
<p>of Democrat would cover a multitude of sins, and perhaps it
</p>
<p>might change him from being the tool of a corrupt adminis
</p>
<p>tration to being the choice of the people of Kansas. He be
</p>
<p>came a candidate for Governor, in opposition to Charles Rob
</p>
<p>inson, at the election of December 6, 1859. Hon. Abraham
</p>
<p>Lincoln was in Kansas during the canvass. It was an ani
</p>
<p>mated one. Medary was backed up by the administration.
</p>
<p>He had as his supporters Russell's and Waddell's teamsters,
</p>
<p>the Indian agents, and hangers on generally. Every effort

</p>
<p>inson was elected Governor by about 3,000 majority, and the
</p>
<p>entire Republican ticket by about the same vote. The Gov
</p>
<p>ernor and members of Congress were the same that were
</p>
<p>elected under the Topeka Constitution of 1855 ; and Topeka,
</p>
<p>as then, now became the State Capital.
</p>
<p>Thus bribery, forgery, perjury, arson and murder, under
</p>
<p>various pretenses, with the assistance of two corrupt admin
</p>
<p>istrations of the Federal Government, backed up by the slave
</p>
<p>power, seducing the weak and striking down the. strong, leav
</p>
<p>ing no effort untried, even unto fire and blood, to force sla
</p>
<p>very into Kansas, failed. The God of battles saw these mur
</p>
<p>ders and secret assassinations ; the groans of the victims
</p>
<p>ascended like incense from liberty's altar, and he swore by
</p>
<p>himself that Kansas should be free.
</p>
<p>Although Medary was overwhelmingly defeated by the
</p>
<p>people of Kansas in the December election, still, by instruc
</p>
<p>tions from Buchanan, he continued to stay in the Territory.
</p>
<p>The people of Kansas had chosen a Governor ; but Medary
</p>
<p>was left by Buchanan to keep up the strife, and guard and
</p>
<p>protect, with the fidelity of a watch-dog, the institution of
</p>
<p>slavery. In February, 1860, the Kansas Legislature passed a
</p>
<p>bill prohibiting slavery in Kansas. Medary vetoed it, and on
</p>
<p>the 29th of the same month the same Legislature passed it
</p>
<p>over his veto. He had previously, by the aid of the military,
</p>
<p>cleaned out all the settlers on the Indian national lands south
</p>
<p>of Fort Scott. This was done at the commencement of winter,
</p>
<p>and hundreds of them perished from hunger and cold. Be
</p>
<p>tween the action of the Federal Government and its ally,
</p>
<p>Capt. Hamilton, the deaths from cold, hunger and assassina
</p>
<p>tion, in this part of Kansas, were frightful to contemplate.
</p>
<p>Capt. Montgomery, as we have before stated, organized a
</p>
<p>company for the defence of the free State settlers in south
</p>
<p>western Kansas. Frequent charges had previously been made
</p>
<p>against him, and in 1859 he gave himself up to Gov. Medary
</p>
<p>to be tried, but no grand jury could be found in Kansas that

<p>holders and border ruffians of southwestern Missouri. In

<p>SLAVERY OUTRAGES IN KANSAS. 101
</p>
<p>November, 1860, placards were extensively posted and circu
</p>
<p>lated in that region setting forth that Capt. Montgomery,
</p>
<p>with a band of abolitionists, were setting free and running off
</p>
<p>all the slaves in the border counties. This was untrue ; but
</p>
<p>it was the last desperate effort of a corrupt administration to
</p>
<p>revive and rally the pro-slavery element for another struggle
</p>
<p>to force slavery into Kansas.
</p>
<p>At this time the entire slave interest in Missouri, from Gov.
</p>
<p>Stewart down, became alarmed. Stewart called out a large
</p>
<p>force of militia, and sent them to the border. The admin
</p>
<p>istration at Washington sent out Gen. Harney to assist Gov.
</p>
<p>Medary. Harney wanted to take the matter out of the Gov
</p>
<p>ernor's hands, by declaring martial law ; but Medary insisted
</p>
<p>that the Government troops should only be used to assist the
</p>
<p>U. S. Marshal to make arrests. Harney's object in declaring
</p>
<p>martial law was, that he could then immediately court-martial
</p>
<p>and shoot Montgomery and his party when they were cap
</p>
<p>tured. It was now rumored that Montgomery was at Mound City
</p>
<p>with three hundred well armed men. Harney, fearing to

<p>make an attack on the city alone, requested the aid of Gen.
</p>
<p>Frost. With their united strength they advanced ; but when
</p>
<p>they arrived they failed to find Montgomery. From this time
</p>
<p>forward all kinds of exaggerated stories and pro-slavery lies
</p>
<p>were freely circulated : Montgomery was here to-day com
</p>
<p>mitting depredations ; to morrow he was somewhere else
</p>
<p>slaughtering the masters and stealing their slaves.
</p>
<p>John Brown, who had suffered so much from the pro-slavery
</p>
<p>border ruffians of Missouri, understanding well the nature of
</p>
<p>the Kansas contest, concluded about this time to make a flank
</p>
<p>movement, and change his base from the Osage country of
</p>
<p>that Territory to Harper's Ferry, Virginia. As a great num
</p>
<p>ber of Virginians, including the son of Ex-Gov. Johnston, had
</p>
<p>come to Kansas to fight him and his cause, he thought it
</p>
<p>courtesy to return the compliment. Arrangements having
</p>
<p>been made to Brown's satisfaction, he and his company en

</p>
<p>their quarters in Washington county, at a house previously
</p>
<p>rented, about five miles from Harper's Ferry. The party
</p>
<p>comprised only 20 men besides Brown, the commander-in-
</p>
<p>chief; five of them were negroes. On the night of the 16th
</p>
<p>of October, 1859, these men forcibly seized the U. S. arsenal
</p>
<p>at Harper's Ferry, and held it from half past ten o'clock on
</p>
<p>Sunday night until about ten o'clock on Tuesday morning.
</p>
<p>The assault to re-capture the arsenal was made by the United
</p>
<p>States Marines, led on by Col. Harris, Lieut. Green, and Maj.
</p>
<p>Russell. Fifteen of Brown's men were killed, three wounded,
</p>
<p>and five taken prisoners. Six citizens were killed.
</p>
<p>This was not a slave insurrection, but a continuation of the
</p>
<p>Kansas struggle. It was the first blow that the free State
</p>
<p>men struck at their old enemy outside of that Territory.
</p>
<p>Brown understood well the nature of the hideous monster,
</p>
<p>and thought he was doing God's service to beard him in his
</p>
<p>den. Physically, the magnitude of the undertaking was too
</p>
<p>great for the small means under Brown's command ; but its
</p>
<p>tragical termination, and the bravery of his death, gave to lib
</p>
<p>erty another martyr, and to freedom a new impulse. Although
</p>
<p>his body lies mouldering in the ground, his soul is in the
</p>
<p>Union army triumphantly marching on.
</p>
<p>Through two presidential terms the slave power kept up
</p>
<p>the Kansas slavery agitation. Through the repeal of the Mis
</p>
<p>souri Compromise, it was opened by Pierce's administration,
</p>
<p>and continued with an energy worthy of a better cause until
</p>
<p>his term of office expired. It was then passed over to Bu
</p>
<p>chanan, as the life and soul of the Democratic party, and he
</p>
<p>revived, extended, and encouraged the agitation for two years
</p>
<p>in Congress under the names of Lecompton, and anti-Le-
</p>
<p>compton Democrats, then Crittenden Compromise, Mont
</p>
<p>gomery-Crittenden Compromise, and then again the English
</p>
<p>bill. Thus, under the guidance of the slave power, and the
</p>
<p>treason of Pierce and Buchanan, the Democratic party be
</p>
<p>came corrupted, demoralized, divided and ruined.

<p>quiesce in the settlement of the Kansas question. He pros-

<p>SLAVERY OUTRAGES IN KANSAS. 103
</p>
<p>tituted the Federal Government by rewarding with office those who
</p>
<p>supported his slave policy by voting for the Lecompton Constitution.
</p>
<p>Joseph Miller, of Ohio, a weak and wavering Democrat, was reward
</p>
<p>ed for his vote in favor of Lecompton with a judgeship in Nebraska ;
</p>
<p>a half dozen more were similarly rewarded. But Douglas, Broderic,*
</p>
<p>Walker, Stanton and Forney, whom he could not bribe, were de
</p>
<p>nounced as traitors to the Democratic party. Gov. Medary; now
</p>
<p>discovering that Buchanan was determined not to permit the Kan
</p>
<p>sas question to be settled during his administration, resigned, De
</p>
<p>cember 20, 1860. As soon as the Southern States began to withdraw
</p>
<p>from the Union, Buchanan signed the bill, admitting Kansas.
</p>
<p>It was determined that this question should be the final
</p>
<p>excuse for separation and disunion. The war had commenced
</p>
<p>in Kansas, and was five years in full blast before John Brown
</p>
<p>made his raid on HaTper's Ferry, and was in its seventh year
</p>
<p>before President Lincoln took his seat. The faithful historian,
</p>
<p>who seeks truth, will find slavery to have been the cause,
</p>
<p>the repeal of the Missouri Compromise an accessory before
</p>
<p>the fact, and driving freedom out of Kansas at the point of
</p>
<p>the bayonet, the exact time when the rebellion commenced.
</p>
<p>* Baeked up and encouraged by the administration at Washington, a combi
</p>
<p>nation of pro-slavery Democrats was formed in California to take the life of
</p>
<p>Senator Broderic. He boldly denounced the Lecompton fraud, and Senator
</p>
<p>Gwin, unable to cope with him in argument, gave Broderic to understand that
</p>
<p>he was anxious to fight him a duel. Broderic refused to fight until after the
</p>
<p>election. Another pro-slavery dog, by the name of Perley, also challenged
</p>
<p>him to fight. Broderic refused. Justice Terry, a Lecompton Democrat, an
</p>
<p>experienced duelist and an excellent shot, then challenged him. Broderic had
</p>
<p>previously taken this man out of the hand3 of the Vigilence Committee, and
</p>
<p>thus saved his life. He now saw there was a price set upon his head, and
</p>
<p>again declined ; but Terry pressed the matter so hard that Broderic at last,
</p>
<p>fearing private assassination, accepted the challenge. The duel was fought
</p>
<p>September 13, 1859. Broderic fell at the first fire, pierced through the lungs,
</p>
<p>and died on the ICth. Calhoun Banner and Tom Hays were Terry's Beconds,
</p>
<p>and J. H. McKibbon seconded Senator Broderie. Buchanan dreaded this

<p>powerful opponent, and the slave holders also dreaded him, and were deter
</p>
<p>mined to have his life. Brought up in the city of New York, and unaccostomed
</p>
<p>to the use of fire armg, he had no chance with the individual who had been
</p>
<p>pitched upon to take his life. His death was a public, political murder, for the
</p>
<p>benefit of pro-slavery principles and pro-slavery men.

<p>Jeff. Davis, as Secretary of War under Pierce, ordered Gen.
</p>
<p>Smith to bring the Federal forces into the field to drive free
</p>
<p>dom out of Kansas. This was in 1856 ; and on the 9th of
</p>
<p>February, 1861, he is appointed commander-in-chief of the
</p>
<p>slaveholder's rebellion at Montgomery, Alabama. Ceasing to
</p>
<p>control, he determines to destroy the Federal Government.

<p>THE SLAVEHOLDERS BECOME SAVAGES, AND COMMENCE WAR
</p>
<p>AGAINST CIVILIZATION.
</p>
<p>South Carolina, on the 20th of December, 1860, takes the
</p>
<p>lead. The rebel chiefs, decorated in all the panoply of war,
</p>
<p>now assembled at Charleston, and joined in a war dance,
</p>
<p>stamping, yelling, and brandishing their scalping-knives and
</p>
<p>tomahawks, threatening death and universal slaughter against
</p>
<p>the tribes of the North. These demonstrations were looked
</p>
<p>upon by the South Carolina tribe as immense, and full of
</p>
<p>promise for the future. Great care was taken to send
</p>
<p>hourly reports, of the most exciting nature, from Camp
</p>
<p>Charleston, to all the other slaveholding tribes. Thus, in
</p>
<p>one of these reports, Chief Ruffian was represented as hav
</p>
<p>ing made a great speech, in which he said : " The inde
</p>
<p>pendence of the Southern tribes can only be secured by the
</p>
<p>tribe qf South Carolina taking the lead." This speech, which
</p>
<p>was made at Columbia, was represented as causing a furore of
</p>
<p>excitement among the braves.
</p>
<p>Another Bull.  " Virginia and other slaveholding States may
</p>
<p>as well at once understand their position with the South Car
</p>
<p>olina tribe."
</p>
<p>Still Another.  " The South Carolina tribe is decidedly in
</p>
<p>earnest. There is but one voice among them, and that is for
</p>
<p>war. They have done counseling  now they act."
</p>
<p>These fire-brands of revolution were swiftly carried in
</p>
<p>every direction by the savages, and served to excite the dif
</p>
<p>ferent tribes to join in the foul plot. As was intended, the
</p>
<p>excitement by this means soon reached the neighboring
</p>
<p>tribes. Mississippi was the first to show sympathy ; and on

<p>the 9th day of January, 1861, they agreed to send warriors to

</p>
<p>Charleston. South Carolina has 703,708 souls, including 402,406
</p>
<p>slaves. Mississippi has 791,305 souls, including 436,631 slaves.
</p>
<p>Onthe 11th of the same month the tribe of Florida, nuoa- '
</p>
<p>bering 140,425 souls, holding 61,745 slaves; also on the 11th,
</p>
<p>the tribe of Alabama, numbering 964,201 souls, including
</p>
<p>435,080 slaves, both of these tribes sent warriors to the camp
</p>
<p>at Charleston. And on the 20 th of January the great and
</p>
<p>powerful tribe of Georgia, numbering 1,057,286 souls, including
</p>
<p>462,198 slaves, also joined the war party, and sent warriors to
</p>
<p>the great camp at Charleston. On the 26th of January the
</p>
<p>tribe of Louisiana, numbering 708,002 souls, including 331,726
</p>
<p>slaves, joined the others by sending warriors to Camp Charles
</p>
<p>ton. On the 1st day of February, the tribe from the Rio
</p>
<p>Grande, Texas, numbering 604,215 souls, including 182,566
</p>
<p>slaves, sent warriors, and joined the other tribes in the fortunes
</p>
<p>of war.
</p>
<p>Seven tribes had now banded together, and had a great
</p>
<p>number of warriors congregated at Camp Charleston. The
</p>
<p>other tribes appeared to be holding off.
</p>
<p>Itwas not until after the seven tribes had united, that a
</p>
<p>chief was selected. On the 9th of February, 1861, Davis
</p>
<p>was, by the consent of the other chiefs at Montgomery, Ala
</p>
<p>bama, declared to be the great chief, around whom were to
</p>
<p>be gathered all the slaveholding tribes. (Capital moved to
</p>
<p>Richmond, Va., May 20th, 1861.)
</p>
<p>Thus, South Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama, Florida,
</p>
<p>Louisiana and Texas, make seven tribes. Combined they
</p>
<p>number 4,968,994 souls, and hold 2,312,028 slaves.
</p>
<p>It was their determination so to arrange matters, that when
</p>
<p>hostilities commenced other tribes would be brought in by
</p>
<p>the excitement. And for the purpose of getting up the war
</p>
<p>fever, Wise started for the James River, and from there he
</p>
<p>went to the Blue Ridge Country, every where urging the
</p>
<p>great men of the tribe to prepare for war. In this way all

</p>
<p>by day, and the red lights by night, could everywhere be seen ; while
</p>
<p>Wise went from camp to camp, counseling the braves and training
</p>
<p>them for the conflict.
</p>
<p>Among the tribes living east of the Blue Ridge, all peaceful pursuits
</p>
<p>were abandoned by day, and the horrors of night were increased by
</p>
<p>the howl .of the wolf, the scream of the panther, and the yell of
</p>
<p>the savage  all equally ravenous and thirsting for blood.
</p>
<p>Thus Wise, with his eloquence, had made all things ready, and only
</p>
<p>one thing, was needed, and that was some one to lead. Chief Ruffian,
</p>
<p>a very old man, was of the Virginia tribe, and upon his head fell the
</p>
<p>honors of commencing the work of death. And on the morning of
</p>
<p>the 12th of April, 1861, at precisely A\ o'clock, standing near the grave
</p>
<p>of Ocepla, in Fort Moultrie, he fired the first gun at Sumter. (This
</p>
<p>man, Edmond Ruffian, aged over 74 years, on the 17th of June,
</p>
<p>1865, committed suicide, at the residence of his son, 27 miles from
</p>
<p>Danville Va., by placing a loaded musket to his mouth, and blowing
</p>
<p>off the top of his head.) This fort, although strong, contained only
</p>
<p>a force of one hundred and nine men ; while the attacking party
</p>
<p>numbered above ten thousand. Thirty-three hours the little gar
</p>
<p>rison held out against overwhelming numbers, when they were com
</p>
<p>pelled, the fort being on fire, to surrender, and haul down the starry
</p>
<p>flag. After which was run up the Palmetto flag of South Carolina.
</p>
<p>Now the management in putting forward Ruffian was in ac
</p>
<p>cordance with the programme laid down. Only five days af
</p>
<p>ter he commenced the attack on Fort Sumter, on the 17th of
</p>
<p>April,/ the tribe of Virginia joined the ignominious seven.
</p>
<p>This was a great acquisition, a very powerful tribe, numbering
</p>
<p>1,596,079 souls, and holding 490,887 slaves ; and located near
</p>
<p>and joining lands with some of the great Northern tribes, its
</p>
<p>acquisition was heralded with delight by the chiefs.
</p>
<p>On the 6th of may, the tribe known as Arkansas, numbering
</p>
<p>435.427 souls, including 111,104 slaves; and also on the 6th
</p>
<p>of the same month, the tribe from the Cumberland, known as
</p>
<p>Tennessee, numbering 1,109,847 souls, including 275,784 slaves ;
</p>
<p>and on the 20th of May, the tribe from Pamlico Sound, known

</p>
<p>as North Carolina, numbering 992,667 souls, including 331,081
</p>
<p>slaves, joined the others.
</p>
<p>This made eleven tribes that had embarked in the war,
</p>
<p>DYING DAYS OF DEMOCRATIC RULE. 107
</p>
<p>numbering in all, men, women and children, 9,103,014 souls.
</p>
<p>The slaves held by these eleven tribes number 3,521,884.
</p>
<p>There remains four tribes, holding slaves, that have refrained,
</p>
<p>in a legislative capacity, from joining the war party. Although
</p>
<p>thousands and thousands of their braves, and manjr of their
</p>
<p>chiefs have gone on their own account, and are now fighting in
</p>
<p>the army of the South, yet the tribes themselves, although
</p>
<p>many of their members sympathize, have never yet joined the
</p>
<p>rebellion in force. Their names are Maryland, numbering
</p>
<p>687,034 souls, and holding only 87,188 slaves. Missouri, num
</p>
<p>bering 1,182,317 souls, and holding only 114,935 slaves. Ken
</p>
<p>tucky, numbering 1,155,713 souls, and holding 225,490 slaves.
</p>
<p>The little tribe of Delaware, numbering 112,218 souls, and
</p>
<p>hplding[ only 1,798 slaves.
</p>
<p>Thus, these four tribes are not in actual hostility against
</p>
<p>the North ; yet the great majority of their leading men
</p>
<p>have very decided sympathies with the South. The four
</p>
<p>tribes number 3,137,282 souls, including 429,441 slaves.
</p>
<p>The condition of the country, long before President Lincoln
</p>
<p>came to Washington, was deplorable. Not only had seven
</p>
<p>States passed the ordinance of secession, and organized a Con
</p>
<p>federacy, but also many, or nearly all the forts in the slave
</p>
<p>States, had been seized on the 2d of January, 1861. Forts Pu
</p>
<p>laski and Jackson, in Savannah Harbor, Georgia, were taken
</p>
<p>possession of by the tribe in that State ; the former mounting
</p>
<p>150 guns, and cost the General Government $923,000 ; the
</p>
<p>latter mounting 14 guns, and cost $80,000. Also the Mount
</p>
<p>Vernon Arsenal in Alabama, with 20,000 stand of arms.
</p>
<p>On January 4th, the next day, Fort Morgan in Mobile har
</p>
<p>bor, was seized by the Alabama tribe. It cost the General
</p>
<p>Government $1,212,000, and mounts 132 guns ; also the Arse
</p>
<p>nal at Mobile, containing 800 stand of arms, and 1,500 barrels
</p>
<p>of powder, 300,000 rounds of cartridges.

</p>
<p>the Mississippi, and Fort Pike, on Lake Ponchartrain, and the
</p>
<p>United States Arsenal at Baton Rougue, were all taken by the
</p>
<p>Louisiana tribe.
</p>
<p>On January 13th, Fort Barrancas, and the United States
</p>
<p>Navy Yard at Pensacola, were seized by the Florida tribe ;
</p>
<p>and the United States Arsenal at Augusta, Geo., was seized
</p>
<p>by the tribe of Georgia on the 24th of January ; and on the
</p>
<p>31st of the same month, the Mint belonging to the United
</p>
<p>States, at New Orleans, was seized, with $389,000 of Govern
</p>
<p>ment money, and $122,000 in the Sub Treasury.
</p>
<p>The Peace Convention now commenced its sittings at
</p>
<p>Washington. How humiliating it is to read how the South
</p>
<p>spurned every offer to prevent the effusion of blood.
</p>
<p>The Illinois and Kentucky Legislatures had previously
</p>
<p>recommended Congress to call a Convention to change the
</p>
<p>Constitution of the United States,! so as to give additional
</p>
<p>guarantees to slavery. In the excitement that was raging,
</p>
<p>Virginia sent invitations to all the States, inviting them to
</p>
<p>send delegates to a Convention, to be held in Washington,
</p>
<p>D. C, on the 4th of February, 1861. Only twenty States re
</p>
<p>sponded ; seven slave  Delaware, Virginia, Kentucky, Mary
</p>
<p>land, Missouri, North Carolina and Tennessee ; thirteen free
</p>
<p> New York, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Massachusetts,
</p>
<p>Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maine, Vermont, Pennsylvania,
</p>
<p>Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Iowa.
</p>
<p>This Convention (wholly unknown to the Constitution) as
</p>
<p>sembled about one month after the traitors at Charleston
</p>
<p>had fired on the ship Star of the West, which was taking pro

<p>vision to the starving garrison at Fort Sumter. It was

<p>without legal form, and got up by traitors to gain time, and

<p>men of the free States went to see what additional conces

<p>bended knees, and implored the traitors to desist. They

</p>
<p>even went so far as to elect Ex-President John Tyler, the
</p>
<p>accessory to President Harrison's assassination, President of
</p>
<p>the Convention.
</p>
<p>The Committee on Propositions brought in, and were ready
</p>
<p>to give their consent to add a new article to the Federal Con
</p>
<p>stitution, to be composed of seven sections, to be called Ar
</p>
<p>ticle 13th.
</p>
<p>The first section provided for a division of all the existing
</p>
<p>territory by the line of 36 deg. 30 min.
</p>
<p>The second section was a pledge never to acquire any more,
</p>
<p>except with the concurrence of a majority of all the Senators
</p>
<p>of the slave States and all the Senators of the free States.
</p>
<p>The third section prohibited Congress' from interfering
</p>
<p>with slavery within any State, or in the District of Columbia,
</p>
<p>without the eonsent of Maryland ; and the slaveholders there
</p>
<p>in also prohibited any interference with slavery in the Terri
</p>
<p>tories, and the slave trade between the slave States.
</p>
<p>The fourth section guaranteed that the Fugitive Slave Act
</p>
<p>should everywhere be respected.
</p>
<p>Fifth  The interests of Virginia required that the foreign
</p>
<p>slave trade should be prohibited. This section prohibited it.
</p>
<p>The sixth section bound the United States to pay for all
</p>
<p>fugitive slaves rescued by violence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Chase made an able speech  before the Convention.
</p>
<p>He said : " Mr. President, let us not rush headlong into that
</p>

<p>On February 8th, the United States Arsenal at Little Rock,
</p>
<p>with 9,000 stand of Arms and 40 cannon, including Bragg's
</p>
<p>Battery, was seized by the Arkansas tribe.
</p>
<p>February 16 th, the Southern traitor, General Twiggs,
</p>
<p>having command of our main army on the frontiers of Texas,
</p>
<p>surrendered his entire force, his men being made prisoners of
</p>
<p>war, and all their arms, munitions and supplies were turned
</p>
<p>over to the enemy.
</p>
<p>All this was done while Buchanan and his Cabinet we're do
</p>
<p>ing all they could to destroy and disablq the Federal Gov
</p>
<p>ernment. Tousey, his Secretary of the Navy, under different
</p>
<p>pretentions, had dispersed the fleet, sending some to cruise
</p>
<p>around the coasts of China and Japan ; some to the Medi
</p>
<p>terranean, and some to the West Indies, so they might rot
</p>
<p>bythe action of the elements in the tropical seas. Others
</p>
<p>were sent to the coast of Africa, under the pretense of cap
</p>
<p>turing slaves, until scarcely a United States war vessel could
</p>
<p>be seen in the Federal'waters.
</p>
<p>Floyd, his Secretary of War, was equally industrious, transferring
</p>
<p>from the free States all the available war material to the arsenals and
</p>
<p>forts located in the slave States. 1 15 ,000 improved muskets and rifles
</p>
<p>were removed from the Springfield and Waterville arsenals to the
</p>
<p>South. He also removed that portion of the Federal army located on
</p>
<p>and near the seaboard (where it was easy of access) far away  some to
</p>
<p>Texas, New Mexico, Arizona. Oregon, California, and other frontier
</p>
<p>stations, from which it would require a year to bring them back.
</p>
<p>Even on the 15th of November Fortress Monroe in Virginia, was only

<p>garrisoned by eight companies of artillery ; the valuable arsenal at

<p>cola, by one company ; the richly stored arsenal at Baton
</p>
<p>Rouge, Louisiana, by one company ; while the New Orleans
</p>
<p>Mint, and the valuable Custom-houses in New Orleans,
</p>
<p>Charleston, Mobile and Savannah, were totally without guard.
</p>
<p>Norfolk Navy-yard, and Pensacola Navy-yard, both having
</p>
<p>millions of property, were only guarded by one hundred and
</p>
<p>twenty marines.
</p>
<p>The first demand made of the President by the rebels, after
</p>
<p>the plot was developed, was, that no reinforcements should
</p>
<p>be sent to Southern fortresses. General Scott plead with
</p>
<p>Buchanan to throw a strong force into Fort Moultrie, as had
</p>
<p>been done in 1832 ; but Buchanan, instead of doing so, as
</p>
<p>sured the rebels that none would be sent.
</p>
<p>Thus the Government, betrayed, stood with both arms par
</p>
<p>alyzed ; and while in thi3 condition seven States, headed by
</p>
<p>South parolina, one by one tore themselves away, taking
</p>
<p>seven forts, four arsenals, one Navy-yard, and the Mint be
</p>
<p>longing to the United States at New Orleans, with five hun
</p>
<p>dred and eleven thousand dollars. The value of the property
</p>
<p>stolen, up to this time,-is set down at twenty-seven millions of
</p>
<p>dollars ; add to this the eight millions of Indian Trust Bonds
</p>
<p>stolen by Floyd, and it makes thirty-five millions of dollars.
</p>
<p>Thus, before President Lincoln was within a thousand miles
</p>
<p>of the Capital, we find a Democratic President and Vice
</p>
<p>President, and leading Cabinet officers, all rotten with treason
</p>
<p>and besmeared with crime, a Government betrayed, robbed,
</p>
<p>bound hand and foot, bleeding and festering and festering
</p>
<p>and bleeding at every wound ; with a bastard institution
</p>
<p>holding its councils and head-quarters at Montgomery, Ala
</p>
<p>bama, with Davis as leader, martialing its thousands of armed
</p>
<p>foes, all eager and bent on destroying the beneficent Govern
</p>
<p>ment they had so foully betrayed.
</p>
<p>From there we again look back to Washington, only for a
</p>
<p>change. There we see Buchanan, the Chief Magistrate, an
</p>
<p>imbecile traitor, tottering away in disgrace, with scarcely

</p>
<p>producing. Nearly all his cabinet officers had fled, to escape
</p>
<p>the punishment due their crimes. But Buchanan remained
</p>
<p>longest, and on the last days of his power pleasingly con
</p>
<p>templated, with a grim-like smile which grew to a laugh, the
</p>
<p>agonizing sufferings of a wrecked and ruined country : re
</p>
<p>marking as he retired, " As George Washington was the first,
</p>
<p>James Buchanan will be the last President of the United
</p>
<p>States." The presidential election of 1860 found the political ele
</p>
<p>ments in a very unsettled condition. Buchanan had given a
</p>
<p>secret pledge to the South before he received his nomination
</p>
<p>at Cincinnati (and he kept it) that the Kansas war should not
</p>
<p>be settled during his administration. The Democrats party
</p>
<p>had become demoralized. From tbe exalted position of de
</p>
<p>fending human freedom and popular government, it became
</p>
<p>the reviler of liberty and deadly enemy of free institutions.
</p>
<p>It 'set aside the rights of man to make room for Calhoun's
</p>
<p>rights of the States. The popular will was to be controlled,
</p>
<p>by bribery and fraud, and was only to be tolerated when it
</p>
<p>served slavery and placed Democrats in office. Pro-slavery,
</p>
<p>disunion, anti-abolition, and a death grip on the spoils, were the
</p>
<p>substitutes offered by Pierce and Buchanan for the Democrat
</p>
<p>ic principles established by Jefferson and Jackson. t
</p>
<p>At Chicago, in Ma)7, 1860, Lincoln and Hamlin received the
</p>
<p>nomination of the Republican party for the offices of Presi
</p>
<p>dent and Vice President of the United States for the ensuing
</p>
<p>four years. The 3d article in the platform adopted, contains
</p>
<p>the following : " We hold in abhorrence all schemes for dis
</p>
<p>union, come from whatever source they may." Another ar
</p>
<p>ticle stipulated that Kansas should of right be immediately
</p>
<p>admitted as a State under the Constitution, recently formed
</p>
<p>and adopted by her people, and accepted by the House of
</p>
<p>Representatives. At Baltimore, June 22, 1860, Stephen A. Douglas and Her-
</p>
<p>schell V. Johnston were nominated for the offices of Presi
</p>
<p>dent and Vice President by the Democratic party. On the

<p>positions. This wing of the party proclaimed slavery na

<p>tional, and freedom only sectional.
</p>
<p>In May, 1860, John Bell and Edward Everett were nomi

<p>nated for President and Vice President by the tail of the old

<p>and create joy in the hearts of millions yet unborn.
</p>
<p>THE PLOT TO ASSASSINATE PRESIDENT LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>Twenty men had been hired in Baltimore to assassinate the
</p>
<p>President elect on his way to Washington. The leader of
</p>
<p>this band was an Italian refugee, a barber well known in Bal
</p>
<p>timore. Their plan was as follows : When Mr. Lincoln ar
</p>
<p>rived in that city, the assassins were to mix with the crowd,
</p>
<p>and get as near his person as possible, and shoot at him with
</p>
<p>their pistols. If he was in a carriage, hand grenades had
</p>
<p>been prepared, filled with detonating powder, such as Orsini
</p>
<p>used in attempting to assassinate Louis Napoleon. These
</p>
<p>wefe to be thrown into the carriage, and to make the work of
</p>
<p>death doubly sure, pistols were to be discharged into the ve
</p>
<p>hicle at the same moment. The assassins had a vessel lying
</p>
<p>ready to receive them in the harbour. From thence they
</p>
<p>were to be carried to Mobile, in the seceded State of Alabama.
</p>
<p>. Gen. Scott heard of the plot, and advised with Senator
</p>
<p>Seward ; and they sent Frederick W. Seward, the son of the
</p>
<p>Senator, to meet Mr'. Lincoln in Philadelphia, and urge him
</p>
<p>to come to Washington in a private manner. It was late on
</p>
<p>Thursday night, February 21st, that Mr. Seward arrived in
</p>
<p>Philadelphia. He immediately went to the Continental Ho

</p>
<p>tel, and communicated the facts to Mr. Lincoln. His reply
</p>
<p>was that he would fulfill his engagements in Philadelphia and
</p>
<p>Harrisburg if he should lose his life.
</p>
<p>On the next day, 22d, (Washington's birthday,) according
</p>
<p>to promise, Mr. Lincoln raised the American flag on Inde
</p>
<p>pendence Hall, Philadelphia. He had also accepted an invi
</p>
<p>tation of the Pennsylvania Legislature to meet them that
</p>
<p>afternoon. He did so ; and remained at Harrisburg until

</p>
<p>20 minutes before 6 o'clock, that evening, when he embarked,
</p>
<p>in company with Col. Lamon, for Philadelphia, at which place
</p>
<p>he arrived at 11| o'clock, and took the through night train
</p>
<p>(which was a little behind time) to Washington. The party
</p>
<p>entered the sleeping car at Philadelphia, and passed through
</p>
<p>Baltimore without any one there knowing he was aboard the
</p>
<p>train. They arrived in Washington at 6^ o'clock on Saturday
</p>
<p>morning, the 23d of February. The President wore no dis
</p>
<p>guise whatever, but journeyed in his ordinary traveling dress.
</p>
<p>His enemies had sworn that he should never be inaugurated ;
</p>
<p>therefore it was necessary to keep a close watch on the move
</p>
<p>ments of the conspirators. This was done by the aid of de
</p>
<p>tectives until after his inauguration. The nanfes of the con
</p>
<p>spirators are in the possession of responsible parties, including
</p>
<p>the President, but for wise purposes are withheld for the
</p>
<p>present. Mr. Lincoln was inaugurated President on the 4th of March,
</p>
<p>1861. After being introduced to the assembled crowd by
</p>
<p>Senator Baker, of Oregon, he read his inaugural address, and
</p>
<p>was then sworn in by Chief Justice Taney.
</p>
<p>While President Lincoln and his Cabinet were engaged in sifting out
</p>
<p>-and sending adrift the official traitors that surrounded Buchanan, the
</p>
<p>South was mostly occupied in getting control of all the property belong
</p>
<p>ing to the General Government and arranging matters so as to be
</p>
<p>come absolute masters of all the slaveholding States. The Golden Cir
</p>
<p>cle, and other secret military organizations, gave them great advan
</p>
<p>tage in getting an organized army early into the field. They had long
</p>
<p>been drilling for the conflict whioh they had brought about, and which
</p>
<p>they long since had determined to settle only by the sword ; their minds
</p>
<p>were made up; not wavering, but settled and determined and impatient
</p>
<p>for the strife. The free States did not dream that the plot was so exten
</p>
<p>sive, or that treason was so deeply rooted and universal in the slave
</p>
<p>States. From the President down the people of the North were sur
</p>
<p>prised and confounded, and for a time were unable to determine what
</p>
<p>course to pursue. While we were wavering and inclining to compro
</p>
<p>mise, the South was firm and resolved to accept none. Unconditional

</p>
<p>independence was their ultimatum. Mr. Lincoln did not understand mat
</p>
<p>ters when, on the 15th of April, he called for only 75,000 volunteers,
</p>
<p>and commanded the rebels to return to peace in twenty days. To this
</p>
<p>small demand Gov. Magoffin, of Kentucky, Gov. Letcher, of Virginia,
</p>
<p>Gov. Harris, of Tennessee, and Gov. Jackson of Missouri, (all slave
</p>
<p>States) refused to furnish their quotas. This was an eye-opener ; and
</p>
<p>/ Mr. Lincoln now for the' first time began to realize his condition and the
</p>
<p>slaveholder's rebellion. 115
</p>
<p>condition of the country. The free States began to vote money and or
</p>
<p>ganize armies to support the Federal cause.
</p>
<p>While the treasonable Confederate commissioners were in Washington
</p>
<p>threatening and demanding, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and New York
</p>
<p>were organizing and sending forward regiments. On the 18th of April
</p>
<p>the Pennsylvania volunteers reached Washington. On the same day the
</p>
<p>Massachusetts 6th regiment passed through New York on its way,
</p>
<p>and next day, while passing through Baltimore, was attacked by a pro-
</p>
<p>slavery mob. Two of its men wsre killed, and ten wounded. They fired
</p>
<p>into the mob, killing eleven, and wounding about thirty. The same day
</p>
<p>the New York 7th regiment left for Washington. The Governor of Ma
</p>
<p>ryland and Mayor of Baltimore informed the President that Baltimore
</p>
<p>was in the hantrs of a mob, and troops going that way to the capital
</p>
<p>would have to fight their way through. On the 3d of May Mr. Lincoln
</p>
<p>called for 42,000 three years' men. He was still loth to believe that the
</p>
<p>entire slave States were rotten with treason. The South had called for
</p>
<p>no particular number of troops, but on the 9th of May the Rebel Con
</p>
<p>gress authorized Davis to accept all that offered.
</p>
<p>The object of the war was wholly misunderstood by a great majority
</p>
<p>at the North, and is hardly yet understood by all. The South went into
</p>
<p>the contest united in relation to the cause, object, and policy of the war.
</p>
<p>The free States embarked in it, divided both as to its cause, policy to
</p>
<p>be pursued, and object to be attained. Some Generals supposed that in
</p>
<p>protecting slave property the Union could be cemented, by convincing
</p>
<p>the South that the free States did not wish to molest, but on the con
</p>
<p>trary would fight for the sacred institution. Others thought that it was
</p>
<p>not the business of the Union army to concern itself about slavery,
</p>
<p>either to protect or destroy it. Still another very powerful and intelli
</p>
<p>gent class, seeing a httle further, discovered slavery to be the heart of
</p>
<p>the rebellion, and that the quickest way to destroy it was to strike it
</p>
<p>where it lived. The first class loved slavery for its own sake ; the sec
</p>
<p>ond neither admired nor hated it, but thought it impolitic to meddle with
</p>
<p>it ; the third despised and detested it, and saw in its downfall a fruitful
</p>
<p>victory, and a restored and happy Union, extending from the Lakes to
</p>
<p>the Gulf, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific, with a justified present

</p>
<p>and a glorious future. The first party despised the abolitionists more
</p>
<p>than they did the rebels ; the second class blamed them for bringing
</p>
<p>about the war ; the third, having a foundation like the rock of Gibraltar,
</p>
<p>remained firm amidst the changing storms and waves of the political sea.
</p>
<p>Some men's judgments lie buried so deep that experience, although a
</p>
<p>great teacher, is unable to reach them. This class, with eyes wide open
</p>
<p>at noonday, will swear it is night. They invariably despise Mr. Lin
</p>
<p>coln, and admire Davis and Lee. Indeed, some of those who voted for

<p>116 DYING STRUGGLE OF THE REBELLION.
</p>
<p>Lincoln, and are supposed to be high in his confidence, have even at
</p>
<p>this late day failed to discover that slavery has anything to do with
</p>
<p>the war.
</p>
<p>\ Despised by the South, hated by the Democratic place-men and their
</p>
<p>dupes, counciled and suspicioned bythe conservatives, and deceived by
</p>
<p>traitors in disguise, Mr. Lincoln must have been directed by divine wis
</p>
<p>dom and strengthened by its power to have grown so fast and so strong
</p>
<p>amidst such adverse surroundings.
</p>
<p>On the 21st of July Gen. McDowell, with an organized force of 18,000
</p>
<p>inexperienced troops, attacked Gen. Beauregard, with 27,000 rebels, at
</p>
<p>Bull Run. For ten hours the ground was hotly contested, when, without any
</p>
<p>seeming cause, a panic seized the Union army, and the entire force fled
</p>
<p>in disorder back towards the Capital. Our loss was about 500 killed and
</p>
<p>1,000 wounded, and Beauregard had taken 1,500 prisoners. This was
</p>
<p>the first effort the disarmed and paralyzed Federal Government made to
</p>
<p>strike back at the traitors. It was a weak and unsuccessful stroke, and
</p>
<p>served to inspire them to new and more desperate deeds.
</p>
<p>On the 10th of August, Gen. Lyon, with 5,200 men, at Wilson's Creek,
</p>
<p>Missouri, made an attack on McCulloch, Rains, Price and Jackson, with
</p>
<p>a combined force of 24,000 rebels. The rebel loss was greater at this
</p>
<p>battle than Beauregard had sustained at Bull Run, being 421 killed and
</p>
<p>1 ,300 wounded ; the Union loss was 263 killed and 721 wounded. The
</p>
<p>odds were tremendous and the contest desperate. The brave and heroic
</p>
<p>Lyon was killed while heading a charge on the enemy's lines. His
</p>
<p>troops retreated in good order to Rolla.
</p>
<p>John C. Breckenridge had remained in Kentucky until Sept. 21. His
</p>
<p>object in so doing was to use his influence to unite that State with Jeff.
</p>
<p>Davis. On the 20th of June Gen. McClellan first took command of the
</p>
<p>troops in Western Virginia, and on the 22d of July he was placed in
</p>
<p>command of the army of the Potomac. On the 1st of November he was
</p>
<p>appointed Commander-in-chief, which office, on account of age, General
</p>
<p>Scott had resigned. On the 13th of May he commenced his advance
</p>
<p>into Virginia, and on the 17th drove the rebels across the Chickahominy.
</p>
<p>On the 23d his own army crosses the same stream, and on the 26th he
</p>
<p>takes possession of Hanover Court House, and on the 31st fights the

<p>menced his Seven Days' battles before Richmond  battles of Gaines'
</p>
<p>Hill, Golding's Farm, Chickahominy, Savage Station, White Oak Swamps,
</p>
<p>and ending at Malvern Hills, July 1st. None of these battles were con
</p>
<p>sidered a success for the cause of the Union ; yet the rebels were severely
</p>
<p>punished in many of these terrible but undecisive .contests.
</p>
<p>President Lincoln, after witnessing the disasters that had befallen
</p>
<p>McClellan, issued a call for 300,000 volunteers. On the 11th of July he

<p>appointed Gen. Halleck Commander-in-chief. He visited the shattered

<p>army of the Potomac, and had a talk with McClellan. On the 6th, Gen.

<p>Hooker, with part of the army of the Potomac, abandoned Malvern Hill.
</p>
<p>On the 16th McClellan evacuated Harrison's Landing, and on the 17th

<p>feated, and his entire army made its retreat in the night. After 41
</p>
<p>days of continued disaster, Pope was relieved of his command.
</p>
<p>The rebels, taking advantage of their success against McClellan and
</p>
<p>Pope, were now threatening Washmgton. On Sept 2d Gen. McClellan was
</p>
<p>assigned to take command of the army for the defence of the Capital.
</p>
<p>Burnside had the day before evacuated Fredericksburg, and on the 5th
</p>
<p>Gen. Lee commenced, at the Point of Rocks, the invasion of Mary
</p>
<p>land. On the 17th the battle of Antietam was fought, after which Lee
</p>
<p>retired across the Potomac. On the 22d Presid't Lincoln issued his proviso
</p>
<p>emancipation proclamation, and on the 1st of October visited McClellan,
</p>
<p>and urged him to cross the Potomac in pursuit of Lee. On the 26th
</p>
<p>McClellan' s army again began to advance, and on the 6th of November
</p>
<p>it occupied Warrenton, Va. On the 7th, after being unsuccessful, except
</p>
<p>in defence, for 470 daj-s, and his inactive policy having cost about
</p>
<p>$1,000,000,0000, he was removed from command, and Gen. Burnside
</p>
<p>appointed to supersede him. The battle of Fredericksburg was fought
</p>
<p>by Burnside on the 13th, and on the 16th he retreated across the Rap
</p>
<p>pahannock after severe loss. Bragg, who had been intrenched at Shel-
</p>
<p>byville and Tullahoma, in Tennessee, was about this time dislodged and
</p>
<p>out-generaled by Rosecrans, who, by a master stroke of policy, be
</p>
<p>came possessor ofHhe military key of the South, Chattanooga.
</p>
<p>Except the few bright spots in the south and southwest, such as Mill
</p>
<p>Springs, Ky., Fort Henry, on the Tennessee, Fort Donaldson, on the
</p>
<p>Cumberland, Farragut at New Orleans, and the evacuations of Nashville,
</p>
<p>Corinth, and Memphis, the year 1862 was full of disaster to the Union
</p>
<p>cause. The mere mention of Virginia or Richmond was enough to
</p>
<p>to make a Union man sick.

<p>The year 1863 commenced with Mr. Lincoln's emancipation proclama
</p>
<p>tion, which declared free the slaves in all States, or parts of States or
</p>
<p>Territories then in rebellion against the General Government. This
</p>
<p>righteous, just, necessary and popular measure^ and the getting rid of
</p>
<p>McClellan, was the turning point in the war. Heaven then looked down
</p>
<p>and smiled upon the cause of theUnion, and the very next day, under Gen.
</p>
<p>Rosecrans, gave us a great victory at Stono River, with trifling loss. Gen.
</p>
<p>Bragg, who commanded the rebels, lost 14,560 men, the greater portion
</p>
<p>118 DYING STRUGGLE OF THE REBELLION.
</p>
<p>of which were killed: On the 8th a great victory was obtained at Spring
</p>
<p>field, Mo., and on the 9th Col. Ludlow succeeded in exchanging about
</p>
<p>20,000 rebel prisoners for the same amount of our men. On the 11th
</p>
<p>we captured Fort Arkansas and Fort McClernard ; our loss was only
</p>
<p>1,000, while that of the rebels was over 5,000,with all their arms and
</p>
<p>supplies. On the 25th the first colored regiment was organized at Port
</p>
<p>Royal, South Carolina.
</p>
<p>On the 26th Gen. Hooker succeeded Burnside in command of the army
</p>
<p>of the Potomac ; and on the 29th Gen. Banks promulgated the emanci
</p>
<p>pation proclamation in New Orleans. On the 26th of February the In
</p>
<p>dian Cherokee National Council repeals the secession ordinance, and
</p>
<p>forever abolishes slavery in their tribe. On the 10th of March the 1st
</p>
<p>South Carolina colored regiment captured Jacksonville, Florida, and on
</p>
<p>the 14th the mighty Farragut moved his Mississippi fleet past Port Hud-
</p>
<p>Bon, on the way to Vicksburg. On the 1st of April he passed the Grand
</p>
<p>Gulf batteries with small loss. On the 16th Admiral Porter's fleet passed
</p>
<p>the Vicksburg batteries, losing only one transport and no men. On the
</p>
<p>28th of April, Gen. Hooker, with the army of the Potomac, crossed the
</p>
<p>Rappahannock, and on the 30th of April Gen. Grant's army landed near
</p>
<p>Port Gibson, Mississippi, and on the 1st of May fought the battle of Port
</p>
<p>Gibson, and commenced marching on Vicksburg. On the 2d Hooker
</p>
<p>fought the battle of Chancellorville, a hotly contested fight. Stonewall
</p>
<p>Jackson, one of the most successful rebel Generals, was wounded, and
</p>
<p>died on the 10th inst. On the 6th Hooker retreated across the Rappa
</p>
<p>hannock, but Lee was unable to pursue. On the 3d the colored South
</p>
<p>Carolina regiment returned from the Cambahee river raid, bringing with
</p>
<p>them 800 slaves and destroying over $2,000,000 worth of rebel property.
</p>
<p>On May 13th Yazoo City, Mississippi, was captured by our gun-boats,
</p>
<p>and rebel property destroyed amounting to over $2,000,000.
</p>
<p>On the 15th Gen. Grant defeated Pemberton at Edward's Ferry, and
</p>
<p>on the 16th drives him to Big Black river. On the 17th Pemberton re
</p>
<p>treated towards Vicksburg with great loss. On the 18th Gen. Grant
</p>
<p>invests Vicksburg. On the 21st the rebels offer to surrender Vicksburg
</p>
<p>if they are permitted to march out. Gen. Grant gives no conditions.

</p>
<p>bravery was displayed by the colored troops under his command. On
</p>
<p>the 28th Boston sent out the first colored regiment that went from the
</p>
<p>North. June 6th the negro troops defeated the rebels at Miliken's Bend.
</p>
<p>On the 15th Lee marches into Maryland with 100,000 troops. On the
</p>
<p>28th Gen. Hooker was superseded by Gen. Meade. On the 30th the
</p>
<p>rebel outworks were breached at Vicksburg. On July 1st the battle of
</p>
<p>Gettysburg commenced, and continued with varied success until the 3d,
</p>
<p>when a great victory was won by Gen. Meade. Twenty- three thousand
</p>
<p>DYING STRUGGLE OF THE REBELLION. 119
</p>
<p>of the rebels, killed and wounded, were left on the field, and 6,000 pris
</p>
<p>oners fell into our hands. Lee retreated at night towards the Potomac.
</p>
<p>On the 4th Gen. Grant obtained his immortal victory at Vicksburg,
</p>
<p>capturing the entire rebel army, 31,720 men, with all their arms and
</p>
<p>equipments, and 234 guns. Aboutthe same time Port Hudson surrendered
</p>
<p>to Gen. Banks 7,000 prisoners and 40 pieces of artillery. An under
</p>
<p>standing was had, that if Lee was successful in Maryland his friends
</p>
<p>were to rise in the city of New York. Chagrined at his defeat, and also
</p>
<p>mortified at Gen. Grant's great triumph at Vicksburg, a pro-slavery riot
</p>
<p>broke out on the 13th, killing negroes, burning the colored Orphan Asy
</p>
<p>lum, and killing peaceable citizens. They were finally subdued on
</p>
<p>the 16th, after many of them had been killed. On the 26th John Mor
</p>
<p>gan, with his entire command, was captured near New Lisbon, Ohio,
</p>
<p>while making a daring rebel raid, (Morgan has since been killed in Ken
</p>
<p>tucky.) John B. Floyd died at Abingdon, Va., Aug. 27th. October
</p>
<p>17th President Lincoln calls for 300,000 more volunteers. Nov. 24th,
</p>
<p>capture of Lookout Mountain, in Tennessee, Gen. Hooker fighting above
</p>
<p>the clouds.
</p>
<p>God waited until the nation resolved to be just before he gave it suc
</p>
<p>cess. You may search history in vain to find such a series of victories
</p>
<p>as those that followed the commencement of 1863. Battles which in
</p>
<p>their magnitude would have appalled all Europe were fought, and vic
</p>
<p>tories made fruitful for the Union cause, not only in the positions gained,
</p>
<p>but in the numbers of the enemy slain ; which numbered, in less than
</p>
<p>125 days, over 50,000, while those taken prisoners in the same length of
</p>
<p>time amounted to over 100,000 more. Since (he commencement of Mr.
</p>
<p>Lincoln's presidential term, Russia has emancipated her slaves, and at a
</p>
<p>great meeting held July 9, 1864, at Geneva, Switzerland, patriotic reso
</p>
<p>lutions were passed, applauding his emancipation policy. The good
</p>
<p>and wise of all countries, from the confines of Russia to half-civilized
</p>
<p>Japan, endorse and sustain it.
</p>
<p>Since Gen. Grant, as Lieutenant General, has taken command of all the
</p>
<p>armies, and especially assumed command of the army of the Potomac,
</p>
<p>there has been a series of successful strategic movements, in which
</p>
<p>Lee has been out-generaled, surprised, and forced to come out from

<p>behind breastworks and fight or abandon his fortifications. Grant holds
</p>
<p>the rebellion by the throat ; and Gen. Sherman in his great campaign
</p>
<p>through the center of the Confederacy, has slain about 50,000 traitors,
</p>
<p>and captured over 150 guns, and has at last taken the heart out of the
</p>
<p>monster in the capture of Atlanta. Farragut who, in 1862, illuminated
</p>
<p>the Mexican Gulf, and lit up the Mississippi with the flame of his guns,
</p>
<p>has gone with his illuminators into the dark bay of Mobile. The forts
</p>
<p>for the defence of the city are already captured, and the fall of the city
</p>
<p>itself is only a question of a few days time.
</p>
<p>120 DYING STRUGGLE OF THE REBELLION.
</p>
<p>Since the President issued his emancipation proclamation, we have,
</p>
<p>with few exceptions, had almost uninterrupted success. Slavery
</p>
<p>is abolished in the District of Columbia. Maryland has become oivil,
</p>
<p>and has also abolished slavery. Delaware has done the same. Mis
</p>
<p>souri, that was overrun with treason, has also passed an act of eman
</p>
<p>cipation. Louisiana has been reclaimed from the hand of the usurper, and
</p>
<p>has done likewise. Western Virginia has done the 6ame. Tennessee
</p>
<p>has bid good-bye to the rebels, and, with Arkansas, is determined
</p>
<p>to come into the Union free. Georgia is now beginning to look
</p>
<p>up ; the storm is passing over her, and in a few more weeks she will be
</p>
<p>out of danger. In North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Texas, Mis
</p>
<p>sissippi, Alabama, and Virginia, large portions of each and all of these
</p>
<p>States are wrested from the grasp of the spoiler. Since Jan. 1st, 1863,
</p>
<p>sufficient territory has been retaken from the rebels to form a country
</p>
<p>larger than the British Empire.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln was unanimously re-nominated by the Union Convention
</p>
<p>that assembled at Baltimore on the 7th of June, for a second term of
</p>
<p>office. No Convention ever yet assembled in-the United States, that so
</p>
<p>completely represented the will and wants of the American people. We
</p>
<p>predict that he will carry almost every State, entitled to an electoral vote
</p>
<p>for President, in November, 1864. To change the policy of the Gen
</p>
<p>eral Government, every man of reflection sees disaster, disgrace, and
</p>
<p>ruin to the cause of the Union. With the reelection of Abraham Lin
</p>
<p>coln of Illinois, and Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, the Union will vir
</p>
<p>tually be restored. These are the only Union candidates, and they will
</p>
<p>receive the undivided support of every Union man.
</p>
<p>The embarrassing circumstances which surrounded Mr. Lincoln during
</p>
<p>the commencement of his present term, the energy by which he overcame
</p>
<p>all obstacles, and his undying devotion to the cause of his country, en
</p>
<p>titles him, like our first Presidents, to a second term. With this
</p>
<p>will come a restoration of our glorious Union, and an honorable and last
</p>
<p>ing peace. Having finished the great work so ably commenced by the
</p>
<p>early Fathers, his well earned fame will enter immortality in company
</p>
<p>with Washington.

</p>
<p>FOOD FOR REFLECTION FOR EVERY MAN WHO VOTES FOR
</p>
<p>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN NO
</p>
<p>VEMBER, 1864.
</p>
<p>The South, finding that separation and independence could not be won
</p>
<p>by the sword, have, by the advice of the stave power, resorted to
</p>
<p>the old game. For this purpose agents were sent to Canada, to dictate
</p>
<p>DETESTING THE UNION. 121
</p>
<p>a platform, and secure a candidate for Vice President at the Chicago
</p>
<p>Democratic Convention, of August the 30th. This was all they expected ;
</p>
<p>it was all they desired. The peace platform was to be held up to then-
</p>
<p>weakened and disheartened Southern brethren as a gleam of hope. By
</p>
<p>this means they expect to be able to hold out until after the presidential
</p>
<p>election, although their already desperate efforts have, in the language
</p>
<p>of Gen. Grant, " robbed both the cradle and the grave," and in their
</p>
<p>own language, started the blood with the sweat. In this des
</p>
<p>perate condition they needed a new and powerful stimulas to keep up
</p>
<p>their courage for a short time longer. This they got in the platform
</p>
<p>adopted at Chicago  it promised that hostilities should immediately
</p>
<p>cease. The slave power also claimed the candidate for Vice Presi
</p>
<p>dent ; and in this they demanded a reliable man, one that would be equiva
</p>
<p>lent to Jeff. Davis himself. This they secured in the nomination of Pen
</p>
<p>dleton of Ohio. With the platform to induce the South to hold out a lit
</p>
<p>tle longer, and Pendleton to occupy a similar position as did John Tyler
</p>
<p>in 1840  with this hellish plot secretly arranged, they hold out to the
</p>
<p>war Democrats the treacherous, blood-stained hand of the expiring slave
</p>
<p>power. The leaders, blinded by a love for office, fail to discover the
</p>
<p>deep-laid scheme, grasp with joy the hand of the monster, which in his
</p>
<p>exhausted condition is already palsied with weakness and growing cold
</p>
<p>with death ; and, in order that this demon may survive, agree to make a
</p>
<p>second Harrison of Gen. McClellan. Who can fail to see that if he should
</p>
<p>be so unfortunate as to be elected, the slave power would, by his as
</p>
<p>sassination, secure disunion and eternal separation. Is any man so fool
</p>
<p>ish as to suppose that in such a position his life would be worth a straw ?
</p>
<p>WHY DO THE SLAVEHOLDERS DETEST THE UNION ?
</p>
<p>Claiming the right of secession and revolution is the only
</p>
<p>means to secure a separation from the free States.
</p>
<p>But why wish to separate ? Let the Northern people cease
</p>
<p>to sympathize, and open their eyes, ears and understandings to
</p>
<p>a realization of what the South demands, and why it de
</p>
<p>mands it.
</p>
<p>They, the rebels, demand an entire separation of the slave
</p>
<p>States from the free States on the line of slavery ; and the

</p>
<p>numerous bloody battles already fought show boldness a'hd
</p>
<p>determination on their part to secure it. But what peculiar
</p>
<p>interest in the South demands the separation ? What portion of
</p>
<p>the Southern people, and what are their occupations in life,
</p>
<p>who for years have been crying, " D  n the Union ?"
</p>
<p>It is not the mercantile interest. The merchants of the
</p>
<p>Sou*h, as a class, have everything to lose, and nothing to gain,
</p>
<p>122 DETESTING THE UNION.
</p>
<p>by a destruction of the Union. Neither is it the mechanical
</p>
<p>interest ; the mechanics of the Sou'h have never manifested
</p>
<p>any dissatisfaction towards the Union. Neither have the
</p>
<p>boating or railroad interests anything to expect by its de
</p>
<p>struction, except complications in the carrying trade by in
</p>
<p>sults and delays from custom-house officers, and increased
</p>
<p>taxation ; they are not opposed to the Union. Eeligion of
</p>
<p>every kind and creed, without a single favorite, are all re
</p>
<p>spected and protected alike, each and all enjoying the glori
</p>
<p>ous privilege of worshipping God at their own time and
</p>
<p>place, and in their own way. It is not the four millions of
</p>
<p>poor, disfranchised, oppressed and degraded slaves that are
</p>
<p>scattered over the South who are rising up against, and de
</p>
<p>termined to destroy the Union ; no, no, it is not these.
</p>
<p>Who, then, is engaged in this foul plot? It was commenced,
</p>
<p>and is continued, by those wicked traffickers in human flesh,
</p>
<p>the slaveholders, who, failing to control, have determined
</p>
<p>TO DESTROY THE UNION.
</p>
<p>Now for the slaveholder's testimony as to why they are in
</p>
<p>arms :
</p>
<p>The. Richmond Enquirer vindicates the war on the ground
</p>
<p>that, " the experiment of universal liberty has failed. The
</p>
<p>evils of free society are insufferable and impracticable in the
</p>
<p>long run. It is everywhere starving, demoralized and insur
</p>
<p>rectionary. Policy and humanity alike forbid the extension
</p>
<p>of its evils to new peoples and coming generations. Thus
</p>
<p>free society must fall and give way to slave society, a
</p>
<p>social system old as the world, and universal as man."
</p>
<p>Another ivitness  Dr. Palmer, the moral mouth-piece of the
</p>
<p>slaveholders, preaching at New Orleans, said : " The provi
</p>
<p>dential trust of the South is to perpetuate the institution of
</p>
<p>domestic slavery as now exis'ing, wi h freest scope for its
</p>
<p>natural development." We must, says the Doctor, " lift our
</p>
<p>selves to the highest moral ground, and proclaim to all the
</p>
<p>world that we hold this trust from God, and in its occupancy

</p>
<p>are prepared to stind or fall."
</p>
<p>Another witness  Alexander Stephens, the Vice President
</p>
<p>of 'the slaveholder's government, in a speech at Savannah,
</p>
<p>Georgia, March 12th, 1861, said: " That African slavery was the
</p>
<p>immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution.
</p>
<p>Jefferson, in his forecast, had anticipated this as the rock on
</p>
<p>which the old Union would split. The prevailing opinion
</p>
<p>entertained by him, and most of the leading statesmen at the
</p>
<p>time of the formation of the old Constitution, was, that the
</p>
<p>detesting the union. 123
</p>
<p>enslavement of the African was in violation of the law of na
</p>
<p>ture  that it was wrong in principle, social, moral and potitical.
</p>
<p>Our new Government is founded on directly the opposite idea,
</p>
<p>and is the first in the history of the world based on the great
</p>
<p>truth that the negro is not equal to the white man ; that
</p>
<p>slavery is his natural and normal condition. Thus the stone
</p>
<p>rejected by the first builders is become the chief stone in the
</p>
<p>corner of our new edifice. Negro slavery is but in its in
</p>
<p>fancy ; we must increase and expand it. Central America
</p>
<p>and Mexico are all open to us."
</p>
<p>At a public meeting held in Charleston, Sonth Carolina, on
</p>
<p>the 17th of December, 1861, one of the speakers remarked :
</p>
<p>" The knell of this Union has been sounded, and it must go
</p>
<p>down, if it has to go down, in a stream of blood, and in a mul
</p>
<p>titude of human sufferings. Three thousand millions of prop
</p>
<p>erty (meaning slaves) is involved in this question. That
</p>
<p>Union of which so many speak in terms of laudation, its vir
</p>
<p>tues, its spirit has forever fled. It is now a dead carcass,
</p>
<p>stinking in the nostrils of the South."
</p>
<p>Howell Cobb, of Georgia, says : " There is, perhaps, no solu
</p>
<p>tion of the great problem of reconciling the interests of labor
</p>
<p>and capital, so as to protect each from the encroachments and
</p>
<p>oppressions of the other, so simple as slavery. By making
</p>
<p>the laborer himself capital, the conflict ceases and the interests be
</p>
<p>come identical."
</p>
<p>A Curious and Explanatory Relic On Barnwell's Island,
</p>
<p>South Carolina, at the house of Mr. Prescott, were found his
</p>
<p>private papers. Rebels often run at the approach of the
</p>
<p>Union army. This traitor fled in such haste that even his
</p>
<p>private correspondence was left" behind. Years after he wrote
</p>
<p>the communication calling out this letter, he was a good Dem
</p>
<p>ocrat. In fact James Buchanan thought him so worthy as to
</p>
<p>have him as Assistant Secretary of State. The letter was
</p>
<p>written by one Garnet, then a member of the Virginia Con
</p>
<p>vention, sitting to revise its Constitution, and dated May 3d,

<p>1851. Garnet says : "In case of South Carolina seceding, I think
</p>
<p>the Federal Government would use force, commencing with a
</p>
<p>blockade of Charleston. If you could only force the block
</p>
<p>ade, and bring the Government to direct force, the feeling in
</p>
<p>Virginia would be very great. Eastern Virginia is strongly
</p>
<p>in tbe right to secede, and is with Carolina, but the West has
</p>
<p>only 60,000 slaves to 491,000 whites ; there is the rub. Members
</p>
<p>from this portion of the State talk strange, and I have been
</p>
<p>124 DETESTING the union.
</p>
<p>pained to hear them. In this body I have apprehensions, as
</p>
<p>well as hopes. You will object to the term Democrat. De
</p>
<p>mocracy, in its original philosophical sense, is indeed incompat
</p>
<p>ible with slavery and the whole system of Southern society.
</p>
<p>If the General Government should succeed, Southern civili
</p>
<p>zation (slavery) is gone."
</p>
<p>One more witness, and, as Lawyers say, we rest.
</p>
<p>The Southern Literary Messenger, Richmond, Va., says :
</p>
<p>" Any man who does not love slavery for its own sake, as a
</p>
<p>divine institution, who does not worship it as the corner-stone
</p>
<p>of civil liberty, who does not adore it as the only possible
</p>
<p>condition on which a republican form of Government can be
</p>
<p>erected, and who does not in his inmost soul wish to see it
</p>
<p>extended over the whole earth as a means of reformation,
</p>
<p>second in dignity, importance and sacredness only to the
</p>
<p>Christian religion  he who does not love slavery with this
</p>
<p>love, is an abolitionist."
</p>
<p>The first witness, the Richmond Enquirer, sets forth the
</p>
<p>objects of the war made by the slaveholders to be the total
</p>
<p>destruction of liberty, alleging that it is a monstrous evil that
</p>
<p>should not go down to future generations. 
</p>
<p>Then we are told by the second witness, Dr. Palmer, " that
</p>
<p>slavery is a Providential trust, and he calls on slaveholders
</p>
<p>everywhere to proclaim to all the world that they hold this
</p>
<p>trust from God." Did ever man hear such blasphemy ? Claim
</p>
<p>ing that God has empowered them to establish markets and
</p>
<p>make merchandise of immortal souls, wallowing in the sweat
</p>
<p>and drinking the blood of those for whom Christ died.
</p>
<p>Then Stephens, high in authority, the third witness, says :
</p>
<p>" the war was commenced by and in the interest of slavery.
</p>
<p>He also admits that all the leading statesmen who lived at
</p>
<p>the time, and helped to frame the old Constitution, believed
</p>
<p>slavery to be wrong ; they rejected it as being unworthy to
</p>
<p>be inserted. But, says Stephens, " the stone that the build
</p>
<p>ers rejected has become the chief one in the corner of our

<p>The fourth, Cobb, says the only way to subdue the irrepress

<p>ible conflict going on between capital and labor, is to make
</p>
<p>slaves of aU laborers everywhere ; then, he says, the conflict
</p>
<p>will cease. Seward only proclaimed that there was a conflict
</p>
<p>going on between free and slave labor, but Cobb goes deeper
</p>
<p>and places it between capital and labor. How would some of
</p>
<p>these free laborers of the North like to have some Democratic
</p>
<p>Southerner buy them and hold them as slaves ? Is that De-

<p>mocracy ? De Bow's Review, published at New Orleans, Vol.
</p>
<p>XXV, for December, 1858, page 663, advocates the enslaving of
</p>
<p>the white race. He says : " To say the white race is not the
</p>
<p>true and best slave race is to contradict all history. Too much
</p>
<p>liberty is the great evil of our age, and the vindication of

<p>slavery the best corrective."
</p>
<p>Reader, if you refuse to swallow and believe all these un-
</p>
<p>"hatural, treasonable sentiments, you are then branded with
</p>
<p>the horrible name of abolitionist.
</p>
<p>We are often surprised that slavery should so hate its own
</p>
<p>offspring. Abolitionists did not create slavery ; but who has
</p>
<p>the hardihood to deny that slavery has made every Abo
</p>
<p>litionist now in America? However obnoxious the child
</p>
<p>may be to the parent, it is a legitimate offspring, and not the
</p>
<p>unwilling production of a rape. And as it required slavery
</p>
<p>to produce abolitionists, so it required slavery to excite hatred
</p>
<p>to free society and free government, which has terminated in
</p>
<p>dreadful civil war. In the language of Calhoun, " It is the
</p>
<p>only question of sufficient magnitude to bring about the de
</p>

<p>By looking into the ancient histories of those countries
</p>
<p>that held slaves, we find that their mode of maintaining slavery

</p>
<p>was by tortures and death. But as America is the land of in
</p>
<p>vention, perhaps some inventive genius has convinced the
</p>
<p>Almighty that a better mode is by doing violence to the hu
</p>
<p>man mind. Thus by Act of Assembly of Louisiana, passed
</p>
<p>in March, 1830, " all persons who shall teach or cause to be
</p>
<p>taught any slave in this State, to read or write, shall, on con
</p>
<p>viction thereof, be imprisoned not less than one or more than
</p>
<p>twelve months."
</p>
<p>In Georgia, in 1829, it was enacted, "if any slave, negro, or
</p>
<p>126 DETESTING THE UNION.
</p>
<p>free person of color, or any white, shall teach any other slave
</p>
<p>or negro, or free person of color to read or write, either writen
</p>
<p>or printed characters, the said free person of color, or slave,
</p>
<p>shall be punished by fine and whipping, or fine or whipping,
</p>
<p>at the discretion of the Court ; and if a white person so of
</p>
<p>fending, he, she, or they, shall be fined not more than $500,
</p>
<p>and a term in the County Jail, at the discretion of the Court"
</p>
<p>Virginia, according to the Code of 1846 : " Every assem
</p>
<p>bly of negroes for the purpose of instruction in reading or
</p>
<p>writing, shall be an unlawful assembly. Any Justice may is
</p>
<p>sue his warrant to any officer or other person, requiring him to
</p>
<p>enter any place where such assembly may be, and seize any
</p>
<p>negro therein ; and he or any other Justice may order such
</p>
<p>negro to be punished with stripes. If a white person assem
</p>
<p>ble with negroes for the purpose of instructing them to read
</p>
<p>or write, he shall be imprisoned in jail, not exceeding six
</p>
<p>months, and fined not exceeding $100."
</p>
<p>In 1834, South Carolina passed an act as follows : " If any
</p>
<p>person shall hereafter teach any slave to read or write, or shall
</p>
<p>aid in assisting any slave to read or write, or cause or procure
</p>
<p>any slave to be taught to read and write, such person, if a
</p>
<p>free white person, shall be fined $100, and imprisoned not more
</p>
<p>than six- months. Slaves and free persons of color, shall re
</p>
<p>ceive not exceeding fifty lashes, and fined not exceeding $50."
</p>
<p>In Alabama , " any person who shall attempt to teach any free
</p>
<p>person of color, or slave, to spell, read or write, shall, upon
</p>
<p>conviction, be fined not less than $200, and not to exceed $500."
</p>
<p>Other slave States have similar enactments, but the forego
</p>
<p>ing are deemed sufficient to show to what lengths this bar
</p>
<p>barous rascality has been carried. The ancients never got
</p>
<p>so low in crime ; they never dreamed of fettering the mind.
</p>
<p>" The slave youths of promising genius," says Gibbon, the
</p>
<p>Roman historian, " were instructed in the arts and sciences,
</p>
<p>and almost every liberal profession and industrial pursuit
</p>
<p>suited to the necessities of Roman society." Thus the educa

</p>
<p>tion of slaves was not prohibited by the Roman Government.
</p>
<p>The same is true of society in the middle Ages. Education
</p>
<p>elevated the slave in his social condition, and opened a way to
</p>
<p>emancipation. Congreve's Politics of Aristotle, page 496, says : " The
</p>
<p>only true analysis to the slavery of Greece and Rome, is to be
</p>
<p>found in that which is still prevalent in Asia, where the evils
</p>
<p>of West India or American slavery are wholly unknown, and
</p>
<p>the relation of master and slave are accepted by both in Ar-
</p>
<p>DETESTING THE UNION. 127
</p>
<p>istotle's words, ' at once light, and for the common interests.'
</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we seek for an analogy in ancient times
</p>
<p>to modern slavery, we may find one in the Catifiendia of the
</p>
<p>Roman nobles, or what may be termed the Corn Plantations of
</p>
<p>Sicily. The population there was slave, and there was no
</p>
<p>check to the misuse of their power by the agents or mas
</p>
<p>ters who superintended them, and there was no intercourse, no
</p>
<p>sense of connection to soften the inherent hardships of their
</p>
<p>condition. They rebelled once and again ; and there was dan
</p>
<p>ger lest their revolt should spread  lest throughout the Roman
</p>
<p>world the slave population should feel that it had a common
</p>
<p>cause." Aristotle's opinion, was, " that there ought be held out to the
</p>
<p>slave the hope of libert}r as the reward of his service. Thus
</p>
<p>by a gradual infiltration, the slave population might pass into
</p>
<p>the free." It did so at Rome through the intermediate stage
</p>
<p>of freedom, and the position of freedmen at Rome in the later
</p>
<p>Republic, and even more under the Empire, was such that the
</p>
<p>prospect of reaching it must have been a great inducement to
</p>
<p>the slaves to acquiesce in their present lot.
</p>
<p>De Tocqueville says : " The slave among the ancients be
</p>
<p>longed to the same race as his master ; and he was often the
</p>
<p>superior of the two in education and instruction." Thus
</p>
<p>hardly any similarity existed between ancient and modern
</p>
<p>slavery. The former were educated, at least many of them,
</p>
<p>and had no peculiar dress to distinguish them from their
</p>
<p>masters ; and many of them, naturally and by acquisition,
</p>
<p>were fffs superiors. But American slavery is very different.
</p>
<p>First, the slaves are of a different race. Second-, they are
</p>
<p>a different color. The tradition of slavery dishonors the
</p>
<p>race, and the peculiarities of the race perpetuate the tra
</p>
<p>dition of slavery. Third, American slavery not only con
</p>
<p>trols the body, but aims to obliterate the mind of the slave.
</p>
<p>And taking advantage of all these peculiarities, the South
</p>
<p>has stepped beyond everything heretofore known on earth
</p>
<p>or in hell, to secure the degradation of an entire race.

</p>
<p>What attribute of Almighty God would allow him to take
</p>
<p>the side of the oppressor ? We ask only, and the answer set
</p>
<p>tles the argument as to which side will succeed. Sunk far be

</p>

<p>The sweet, sweet love of daughter, of sister, and of wife.

<p>The kiss in which he half forgets even such a yoke as yours ;

</p>
<p>Still let the bridegroom's arms enfold an unpolluted bride.
</p>

</p>
<p>That turns his human heart to steel, the white man's blood to flame.
</p>
<p>Lest when his latest hope is fled, you taste of his despair,
</p>
<p>And learn by proof, in some wild hour, how much the wretched dare.

<p>We have, in the body of this work, established the fact
</p>
<p>that the Southern slaveholders and their Nothern abettors
</p>
<p>were the sole originators of the terrible war now raging. We

<p>HISTORICAL SKETCH

<p>OP TH M
</p>
<p>GREAT PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST
</p>
<p>Of 1864.
</p>
<p>Although Pierce and Buchanan had wrecked the Demo
</p>
<p>cratic party, its leaders, with what assistance they secured
</p>
<p>from the South, made an attempt to bind up the fragments
</p>
<p>floating about in the free States, in conjuction with Jeff Davis,
</p>
<p>to make a last dying effort to check the rising progress of civ
</p>
<p>ilization. For this purpose they gathered at Chicago on the
</p>
<p>29th of August, and presented the names of George B. McClel
</p>
<p>lan for President, and George H. Pendleton for Vice-President,
</p>
<p>agreed on and adopted the following
</p>
<p>PLATFORM.
</p>
<p>Resolved, That in the future, as in the past, we will adhere
</p>
<p>with unswerving fidelity to the Union under the Constitution,
</p>
<p>as the only solid foundation of our strength, security, and hap
</p>
<p>piness as a people, and as a frame-work of government equally
</p>
<p>conducive to the welfare and prosperity of all the States, both
</p>
<p>Northern and Southern.
</p>
<p>Resolved, That this Convention does explicitly declare, as
</p>
<p>the sense of the American People, that, after four years of
</p>
<p>failure to restore the Union by the experiment of war, during
</p>
<p>which, under the pretense of a military necessity of a war
</p>
<p>power higher than the Constitution, the Constitution itself
</p>
<p>has been disregarded in every part, and public liberty and
</p>
<p>private right alike trodden down, and the material prosperity
</p>
<p>of the country essentially impaired, justice, humanity, liberty,
</p>
<p>and the public welfare, demand that immediate efforts be

</p>
<p>made for a cessation of hostilities, with a view to an ultimate
</p>
<p>Convention of all the States, or other peaceable means, to the
</p>
<p>end that at the earliest practical moment peace maybe restored
</p>
<p>on the basis of the Federal Union of the States.
</p>
<p>Resolved, That the direct interference of the military au
</p>
<p>thority of. the United States in the recent elections held in
</p>
<p>Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri and Delaware, was a shameful
</p>
<p>violation of the Constitution, and the repetition of such acts
</p>
<p>in the approaching election will be held as revolutionary, and
</p>
<p>resisted with all the means and power under our control.
</p>
<p>Resolved, That the aim and object of the Democratic party
</p>
<p>is to preserve the Federal Union, and the rights of the States
</p>
<p>unimpaired ; and they hereby declare that they consider the
</p>
<p>Administrative usurpation of extraordinary and dangerous
</p>
<p>powers not granted by the Constitution, the subversion of the
</p>
<p>civil by military law in States not in insurrection, the arbi
</p>
<p>trary military arrest, imprisonment, trial and sentence of
</p>
<p>American citizens in States where civil law exists in full force,
</p>
<p>the suppression of freedom of speech and of the press, the de
</p>
<p>nial of the right of asylum, the open and avowed disregard of
</p>
<p>State rights, the employment of unusual test-oaths, and the
</p>
<p>interference with and denial of the right of the people to bear
</p>
<p>arms, as calculated to prevent a restoration of the Union and
</p>
<p>the perpetuation of a government deriving its just powers
</p>
<p>from the consent of the governed.
</p>
<p>Resolved, That the shameful disregard of the Administra
</p>
<p>tion to its duty in respect to our fellow citizens who now and
</p>
<p>Song have been prisoners of war in a suffering condition, de
</p>
<p>serves the severest reprobation, on the score alike of public
</p>
<p>interest and common humanity.
</p>
<p>Resolved, That the sympathy of the Democratic party is
</p>
<p>heartily and earnestly extended to the soldiery of our army
</p>
<p>who are and have been in the field under the flag of our
</p>
<p>country.; and, in the event of our attaining power, they will

<p>receive all the care and protection, regard and kindness, that

<p>the brave soldiers of the Republic have so nobly earned.
</p>
<p>The platform was a compromise between the two frag
</p>
<p>ments, one was represented by such men as Vallandigham
</p>
<p>and Pendleton. The former was made a Knight of the Golden
</p>
<p>Circle while exiled in the town of Windsor, C. W., by one
</p>
<p>Amos Green, Grand Master of the order for Illinois. The
</p>
<p>latter, Pendleton, had perhaps been a member of long stand-
</p>
<p>great presidential contest op 1864. 131
</p>
<p>ing ; this pair of political adventurers and their dupes went
</p>
<p>into the Chicago Convention, stripped to the waist, to battle
</p>
<p>for the South.
</p>
<p>They held that any State, at its option, can pull the key
</p>
<p>stone from the Federal arch, even if the destruction of the
</p>
<p>entire fabric should be the result ; slavery they held to be a
</p>
<p>beneficent institution, and, like the leaders of the rebellion, be
</p>
<p>lieved it to be of divine origin ; rather than admit, the right of
</p>
<p>the National Government to strike back, or admit slavery to
</p>
<p>be wrong, they justified the rebellion, and, with one accord,
</p>
<p>shouted, " Let the South go !"
</p>
<p>They justified secession as constitutional, and slavery they-
</p>
<p>held to be the law of God. With such opinions, cowardice
</p>
<p>was all that prevented them from shedding patriotic blood.
</p>
<p>These are the identical sentiments of Jeff. Davis, who sent
</p>
<p>Sanders, Thompson and Clay from Richmond, as commission
</p>
<p>ers to meet Vallandigham and other friends in Canada, there
</p>
<p>to engineer the assembling- Democratic Convention. They
</p>
<p>ran up the white flag and cried "peace;" with them, peace
</p>
<p>and disunion meant the same ; disunion, they claimed, had
</p>
<p>already taken place, and if peace could be obtained while the
</p>
<p>rebel government was in full blast, its authority thereby
</p>
<p>would be acknowledged, and separation become eternal. Be
</p>
<p>lieving the nation disheartened, they thought to take advan
</p>
<p>tage of the hour, and even had sufficient influence to get the
</p>
<p>insertion of that traitorous and cowardly clause, in the second
</p>
<p>resolution of the platform, which declares that " after four
</p>
<p>years of failure to restore the Union, by the experiment of
</p>
<p>war, &c." This clause in the resolution was inserted to dis
</p>
<p>hearten the nation, to induce it to abandon the contest as
</p>
<p>hopeless ; it was also a thrust at the incapacity and inefficiency
</p>
<p>of the Federal army to cope with the rebels ; it conveyed the
</p>
<p>idea that no progress had been made, and insinuated that the
</p>
<p>rebellion was already a success. This assertion was not only
</p>
<p>a lie, but a slander, as the' following facts plainly show. In

</p>
<p>1861, when the rebellion became general, the territory under
</p>
<p>the control of the rebels amounted to a 1,653,852 square mile's,
</p>
<p>132 historical sketch of the
</p>
<p>and the population numbered 12,121,294. The Federal army
</p>
<p>had already won back by the sword 1,311,184 square miles of
</p>
<p>territory, and brought back a population of 7,638,062, leaving,
</p>
<p>at the time of the assembling of the Chicago Convention,
</p>
<p>only 342,668 square miles of territory under rebel rule, with
</p>
<p>the reduced population pf only 4,458.232 souls. Yet, in the
</p>
<p>face of all these facts, this traitorous clique compelled the
</p>
<p>Convention to gratify the rebels by declaring the war for the
</p>
<p>Union a failure.. This was a great triumph for Jeff Davis.
</p>
<p>Their hand was next seen in the nomination of one of their
</p>
<p>clan for Vice-President ; the reasons for this are given more
</p>
<p>fully on pages 120 and 121. Their numerical strength was
</p>
<p>not so great as the McClellan party, but they were unscru
</p>
<p>pulous, energetic and desperate. The friends of McClellan
</p>
<p>did not dream of the plot. They thought very little of plat
</p>
<p>forms, and thought very little of resolutions ; they had un
</p>
<p>bounded confidence in him but the Knights had every thing
</p>
<p>ready. He would, if elected, have been brushed away like a
</p>
<p>cobweb, and the treason of the Vice-President, through official
</p>
<p>position, would have sealed the doom of the republic.
</p>
<p>McClellan's theory was to restore the Union by concessions
</p>
<p>and compromises with the South ; he held that the Constitu
</p>
<p>tion itself was the creature of compromise. As a means of
</p>
<p>conciliation he was pledged to defend slavery by placing
</p>

<p>GREAT PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST OP 1864. 133
</p>
<p>Every honest man, who wanted to do unto the rest of the
</p>
<p>human race as he would have them do unto him, was to be
</p>
<p>hunted like a wild beast  all to appease the unnatural discon
</p>
<p>tent of slavery. This feeling showed itself very prominently
</p>
<p>at Democratic meetings. ' " Hang Abe Lincoln," " hang Sew
</p>
<p>ard," " hang Sumner," " hang Wilson," " hang Garrison,"
</p>
<p>" hang Beecher," " hang Chefever," "hang every d  d Aboli
</p>
<p>tionist son of a b  h." Such was the then proposed Demo
</p>
<p>cratic way of stopping the war.
</p>
<p>The Republican party they declared to be the cause of the
</p>
<p>war. Lincoln had no right to defend the national life. The
</p>
<p>war on his part was 'unconstitutional, wicked and malicious,
</p>
<p>and carried on by the fiendish spirit of abolitionism ; that he
</p>
<p>was not conducting the war to restore the Union, but continu
</p>
<p>ing it for the benefit of adventurers and shoddy contractors ;
</p>
<p>that the South would make peace to-day if their constitutional
</p>
<p>rights were guaranteed. The enormous debt of England,
</p>
<p>about 4,000,000,000, was declared to be as nothing in compar
</p>
<p>ison to the burden Lincoln was heaping on us ; greenbacks
</p>
<p>and national bank money were denounced as valueless ; the
</p>
<p>old banking institutions of the States were appealed to to act in
</p>
<p>self-defense by discrediting the Government currency ; the
</p>
<p>shipping interest was drawn into the contest, and declared to
</p>
<p>have been neglected and ruined ; the tax-gatherer was pointed
</p>
<p>at as little better than a highwayman ; the President was
</p>
<p>charged with being a usurper and destroyer of civil liberty.
</p>
<p>If the orators and press of the Democratic party agreed in
</p>
<p>any one thing, it was in hating " Lincoln "  they hated his ad
</p>
<p>ministration  they hated all he did and said  they hated the
</p>
<p>national government because he had control of it  they hated
</p>
<p>the war because he was conducting it  they hated the Union
</p>
<p>because he loved and was trying to save it  they despised
</p>
<p>liberty because he proclaimed it to be the natural inheritance
</p>
<p>of all men, black as well as white.
</p>
<p>So infuriated were some of these madmen that they would

<p>negro competition  (shame)  they feared he might rival them
</p>
<p>in energy and ability. This class wanted the slave kept in
</p>
<p>slavery, for self-protection. Every low and selfish interest
</p>
<p>was roused up in opposition to Mr. Lincoln. Resistance to
</p>
<p>the draft was counselled and advised. Democrats were told
</p>
<p>that they could get no office. McClellan, they said, had been
</p>
<p>removed from command of the army, because he was a good
</p>
<p>Democrat. The rebels in front of Petersburg, Va., Septem

</p>
<p>at Chicago. The foreign population were told that their
</p>
<p>friends in the army were put in front, with Democratic regi
</p>
<p>ments, to do all the hard fighting. If an honest, straight for
</p>
<p>ward man refused to act with the party, he was pointed at as
</p>
<p>one who had sold his birthright for greenbacks. Hopelessly
</p>
<p>demoralized themselves, they failed to destroy confidence in

</p>
<p>THE CAMPAIGN
</p>
<p>AS CONnUCTED BY
</p>
<p>THE UNION PARTY,
</p>
<p>TERMINATING IN THE RE-ELECTION OP MR. LINCOLN
</p>
<p>FOR A SECOND TERM.
</p>
<p>The party fiat bore in its bosom the patriotic heart of the
</p>
<p>nation, conscious of its strength, and confiding in the justice
</p>
<p>of its cause, made its nomination early. The demoralized De
</p>
<p>mocracy hung back to see if anything would turn up ; and it
</p>
<p>was not until the 29th day of August that they entered the
</p>
<p>canvass. Lincoln had done many things during the term he
</p>
<p>had served, to enrage the traitors in the South, and vex their
</p>
<p>friends in the North. Suspension of the writ of Habeas Cor
</p>
<p>pus, and the Proclamation of Freedom, were declared by them
</p>
<p>to be treason. Before either of these measures had been
</p>
<p>adopted, they plotted to take his life. He had to wade through
</p>
<p>treason to reach the chair of State.
</p>
<p>It was a dark day in our country's history when an armed
</p>
<p>guard had to surround the hotel (Willard's) where the Chief
</p>
<p>Magistrate had taken temporary lodgings, to prevent his as
</p>
<p>sassination. And on the day (4th March, '61,) of his Inaugura
</p>
<p>tion, he was escorted up Pennsylvania Avenue in a hollow
</p>
<p>square of cavalry, and the utmost vigilance was exercised by
</p>
<p>Gen. Scott to prevent his being publicly assassinated on the
</p>
<p>way to the Capitol, to deliver his Inaugural Address from the
</p>
<p>east portico. These were terrible times ; and, to add to his

</p>
<p>embarrassment, though unintentionally, Gen. Scott wrote a
</p>
<p>136 THE UNION CAMPAIGN.
</p>
<p>letter the day before the inauguration, (March 3d,) directed to
</p>
<p>Wm. H. Seward, in which he pictures out a dark and gloomy
</p>
<p>future. " If the Government resorted to force, two or three
</p>
<p>years of war would leave devastated provinces without future
</p>
<p>hope of reconciling the Southern people to their conquerors."
</p>
<p>Viewing the future from this stand-point, Gen. Scott advised
</p>
<p>the incoming administration to say to the Southern States
</p>
<p>" Wayward sisters, depart in peace."  Second vol., page 628,
</p>
<p>Scott's Life.
</p>
<p>Such counsel, from so experienced a soldier and' brave a man
</p>
<p>as Scott, would have staggered most men ; but Mr. Lincoln pit
</p>
<p>ted himself against all such weakness, and accepted war. The
</p>
<p>ideas of '76, and the accomplishments pf ;87, were too sacred to
</p>
<p>be abandoned without a struggle. Through his patriotism and
</p>
<p>invincible courage, he rallied the nation to its own defence.
</p>
<p>After twenty months of wavering and doubtful conflict, the
</p>
<p>star of success growing dim, in one of those moments when
</p>
<p>hope gives way to despair, and death is sought as a refuge, he
</p>
<p>grasped and threw into the struggle the ideas of '76. Though
</p>
<p>morally weakened by being used only as a war measure, yet,
</p>
<p>thus feebly touched, it electrified the nation. When the people
</p>
<p>heard above the din of battle the loud roar of the artillery of
</p>
<p>the colonial revolution, their patriotic enthusiasm commenced
</p>
<p>kindling to the skies. The evil political spirits of the present,
</p>
<p>and the apparitions of their kindred of the past, had to this
</p>
<p>time hung like an incubus around the President ; but when he
</p>
<p>wrote "Fieedom" across the front of his administration, they
</p>
<p>vanished before the brightness of the hour. In this elevated
</p>
<p>position, Moses-like, he learned the will of Heaven, and thus,
</p>
<p>through the following proclamation, gave it to the nation :
</p>
<p>THE EMAN CIPATION . PROCLAMATION.

<p>Proclamation was issued by the President of the United

<p>one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, all persons held

<p>as slaves within any State, or designated part of a State, the

<p>people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United

<p>maintain the freedom of such persons, and will do no act or

<p>acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts

<p>they may make for their actual freedom.
</p>
<p>" That the Executive will, onthe first day of January afore

<p>said, by proclamation, designate the States and parts of States,

<p>if any. in which the people thereof respectively shall then be

<p>in rebellion against the United States, and the fact that any

<p>State, or the people thereof, shall on that day be in good faith
</p>
<p>represented in the Congress of the United States by members

<p>chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of the qualified

<p>voters of such State shall have participated, shall, in tile ab

<p>sence of strong countervailing testimony, be deemed conclu

<p>sive evidence that such State and the people thereof are not

<p>then in rebellion against the United States."

<p>Now, therefore, I, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President of the

<p>United States, by virtue of the power in me vested as Com

<p>mander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States
</p>
<p>in time of actual armed Rebellion against the authority and

<p>government of the United States, and as a fit and necessary

<p>so to do, publicly proclaim for the full period of one hundred

<p>the present, left precisely as if this Proclamation were not

<p>And I hereby enjoin upon the people so declared to be free,

<p>to abstain from all violence, unless in necessary self-defence,

<p>and I recommend to them that in all cases, when allowed,

<p>they labor faithfully for reasonable wages.

<p>of suitable condition will be received into the armed service

<p>of the United States to garrison forts, positions, stations, and

<p>And upon this act, sincerely believed to be an act of justice,

<p>voke the considerate judgment of mankind, and the gracious

<p>history as the grandest achievement of his administration. So
</p>
<p>completely had it grown in favor with the people that, in a
</p>
<p>little over six months after it was issued, a Convention was
</p>
<p>called, in order that some marks of approval might be made
</p>
<p>manifest. With patriotic gratitude the people endorsed it,

</p>
<p>not only as a War Measure, but as an act of justice, and renom
</p>
<p>inated its great and beloved author for a second term without
</p>
<p>a dissenting voice.
</p>
<p>The National Convention assembled at Baltimore on the 7th
</p>
<p>of June, 1864, and there nominated Abraham Lincoln for re
</p>
<p>election as President, with Andrew Johnson as Vice President,
</p>
<p>and adopted and presented to the American people the follow
</p>
<p>ing Platform :
</p>
<p>Resolved, That it is the highest duty of every American
</p>
<p>citizen to maintain against all their enemies the integrity of
</p>
<p>the Union, and the paramount authority of the Constitution
</p>
<p>and laws of the United States ; and that, laying aside all dif
</p>
<p>ferences of political opinion, we pledge ourselves as Union
</p>
<p>men, animated by a common sentiment, and aiming at a com
</p>
<p>mon object, to do everything in our power to aid the Govern
</p>
<p>ment in quelling by force of arms the rebellion now raging
</p>
<p>against its authority, and in bringing to the punishment due
</p>
<p>to their crimes the rebels and traitors arrayed against it.
</p>
<p>Resolved, That we approve the determination of the Gov
</p>
<p>ernment of the United States not to compromise with rebels,
</p>
<p>nor to offer any terms of peace, except such as may be based
</p>
<p>upon an "unconditional surrender" of their hostility, and
</p>
<p>a return to their just allegiance to the Constitution and
</p>
<p>laws of the United States ; and that we call upon the Govern
</p>
<p>ment to maintain this position, and to prosecute the war with
</p>
<p>the utmost possible vigor to the complete suppression of the
</p>
<p>rebellion, in full reliance upon the self-sacrifice, the patriotism,
</p>
<p>the heroic valor, and the undying devotion of the American
</p>
<p>people to their country and its free instituions.
</p>
<p>Resolved That, as Slavery was the cause, and now constitutes
</p>
<p>the strength of this rebellion, and as it must be always and
</p>
<p>everywhere hostile to the principles of Republican govern
</p>
<p>ment, justice and the national safety demand its utter and
</p>
<p>complete extirpation from the soil of the Republic ; and that
</p>
<p>we uphold and maintain the acts and proclamations by which

<p>the government in its own defense, has aimed a death-blow at
</p>
<p>this gigantic evil. We are iii favor furthermore, of such an
</p>
<p>amendment to the Constitution, to be made by the people in
</p>
<p>conformity with its provisions, as shall terminate and forever
</p>
<p>prohibit, the existence of Slavery within the limits of the
</p>
<p>jurisdiction of the United States.
</p>
<p>Resolved, That the thanks of the American People are due
</p>
<p>140 THE UNION CAMPAION.
</p>
<p>to the soldiers and sailors of the Army and Navy, who have
</p>
<p>periled their lives in defense of their country, and in vindica
</p>
<p>tion of the honor of the flag ; that the nation owes to them
</p>
<p>some permanent recognition of their patriorism and valor, and
</p>
<p>ample and permanent provision for those of their survivors
</p>
<p>who have received disabling and honorable wounds in the
</p>
<p>service of the country ; and that the memories of those who
</p>
<p>have fallen in its defense shall be held in grateful and ever
</p>
<p>lasting remembrance.
</p>
<p>Resolved, That we approve and applaud the practical wis
</p>
<p>dom, the unselfish patriotism and unswerving fidelity to the
</p>
<p>Constitution and the principles of American liberty, with
</p>
<p>which Abraham Lincoln has discharged, under circumstances
</p>
<p>of unparalleled difficulty, the great duties a,hd responsibilities
</p>
<p>of the presidential office ; that we approve and endorse, as
</p>
<p>demanded by the emergency, and essential to the preservation
</p>
<p>of the nation ; and as within the Constitution, the measures
</p>
<p>and acts which he has adopted to defend the nation against
</p>
<p>its open and secret foes ; that we approve especially the Proc
</p>
<p>lamation of Emancipation, and the employment as Union
</p>
<p>soldiers of men heretofore held in Slavery ; and that we have
</p>
<p>full confidence in his determination to carry these and all
</p>
<p>other constitutional measures essential to the salvation of the
</p>
<p>country into full and complete effect.
</p>
<p>Besolved, That we deem it essential to the general welfare
</p>
<p>that harmony should prevail in the National councils, and we
</p>
<p>regard as worthy of public confidence and official trust those
</p>
<p>only who cordially endorse the principles proclaimed in these
</p>
<p>resolutions, and which should characterize the administration
</p>
<p>of the Government.
</p>
<p>Resolved, That the Government owes to all men employed
</p>
<p>in its armies, without regard to distinction of color, the full
</p>
<p>protection of the laws of war ; and that any violation of these
</p>
<p>laws, or of the usages of civilized nations in the time of war
</p>
<p>by the Rebels now in arms, should be made the subject of full

<p>and prompt redress.
</p>
<p>Resolved, That the foreign immigration, which in the past
</p>
<p>has added so much to the wealth and development of resources
</p>
<p>and increase of power to this nation, the Asylum of the
</p>
<p>oppressed of all nations, should be fostered and encouraged
</p>
<p>by a liberal and just policy.
</p>
<p>Resolved, That we are in favor of the speedy construction
</p>
<p>of a railroad to the Pacific.
</p>
<p>THE UNION CAMPAIGN. 141
</p>
<p>Resolved, That the National faith, pledged for the redemp
</p>
<p>tion of the Public Debt, must be kept inviolate ; and that for
</p>
<p>this purpose we recommend economy and rigid responsibility
</p>
<p>in the public expenditures, and a vigorous aud just system of
</p>
<p>taxation  that it is the duty of every loyal State to sustain
</p>
<p>the credit and promote the use of the National Currency.
</p>
<p>Resolved, That we approve the position taken by the Gov
</p>
<p>ernment that the people of the United States never regarded
</p>
<p>with indifference the attempt of any European power to over
</p>
<p>throw by force, or to supplant by fraud, the institutions of any
</p>
<p>Republican government on the western continent, and that
</p>
<p>they view with extreme jealousy, as menacing to the peace
</p>
<p>and independence of this our conntry, the efforts of any such
</p>
<p>power to obtain new footholds for monarchical governments,
</p>
<p>sustained by a foreign military force, in near proximity to the
</p>
<p>United States.
</p>
<p>The platform adopted at Philadelphia, June 18, 1856, with
</p>
<p>Fremont as candidate, set forth in the first resolution the
</p>
<p>principles of '76, and at Chicago, in May, 1860, the same prin
</p>
<p>ciples were reiterated in the second resolution of the Repub
</p>
<p>lican Platform ; and at Baltimore in 1864, in the third resolution
</p>
<p>Slavery is declared to be hostile to republican government,
</p>
<p>whilst the platforms of 1856 and I860 declared against slavery
</p>
<p>extension, they did not propose to legally disturb it in the
</p>
<p>slaveholding States, but the Baltimore Convention was con
</p>
<p>sistent. The statutes had become fundamentally changed by
</p>
<p>the action of the slave States themselves in rebelling. The
</p>
<p>third resolution declare?, as so do the rebels, that Slavery was
</p>
<p>the cause of the Rebellion. The Proclamation is endorsed in
</p>
<p>the resolution, not only as a ivar measure, but as an act of
</p>
<p>justice, and the extirpation of slavery from the soil of the
</p>
<p>Republic is demanded.

<p>In adopting this measure, Mr Lincoln showed great ability

<p>142 THE UNION CAMPAIGN.
</p>
<p>as the record of the 100,000 blacks now soldiers in the army
</p>
<p>of the Republic abundantly proves. Even the rebel General
</p>
<p>Lee, the ablest man engaged in the rebellion, in a letter, dated,
</p>
<p>C. S. Armies, Feb. 18th, 1865, to E. Barksdale, advocates the
</p>
<p>policy of arming the blacks, not only as necessary but expe
</p>
<p>dient ; but the slaveholders of the Gulf States at first opposed
</p>
<p>him and refused the demands of the rebel chief. Slavery,
</p>
<p>the cause of the rebellion, had already become chronic in the
</p>
<p>Southern Confederacy. The Richmond Enquirer of February
</p>
<p>23d, 1865, claims that " Virginia did not commence the rebel
</p>
<p>lion ; neither did Tennessee, Missouri or Kentucky .; but the
</p>
<p>Gulf States swore the oath of success or universal destruction.
</p>
<p>This oath has been broken and they by whom the first blow
</p>
<p>was struck are the first to desert." The above remarks were
</p>
<p>made on the defeat, by senators from the Gulf States, of the
</p>
<p>bill to arm the blacks, previously passed by the rebel house
</p>
<p>of representatives. The Enquirer continues : " Monday, the
</p>
<p>compact of mutual support was broken; the bill to appropriate
</p>
<p>the slaves so as to secure honorable existence, was defeated
</p>
<p>in the senate principally by senators from the Gulf States.
</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be well for the Gulf States to reconsider
</p>
<p>the vote. Virginia, Tennessee, Missouri and Kentucky will yet
</p>
<p>see that their people are not slaves in order that the incon
</p>
<p>veniences of war may not be felt on the Congaree and the
</p>
<p>Tombigbee." The Richmond Sentinel-, February 3d, 1865, Davis' organ,
</p>
<p>says: " The soldiers from Texas, Mississippi, Kentucky, Georgia
</p>
<p>and Virginia have spoken in favor of arming the slaves. Gen.
</p>
<p>Lee has also requested that it should be done, the rebel house
</p>
<p>of representatives has taken affirmative action, but the senate
</p>
<p>is disappointing and delaying  are we to add, defeating."
</p>
<p>Gov. Brown of Georgia about the same date discourses thus:

<p>" In a measure, whatever may be our opinion of their normal
</p>
<p>condition of interests, we cannot expect them to perform deeds

<p>it of them. Whenever we establish the fact that they are a
</p>
<p>military people we destroy our theory that they are unfit to
</p>
<p>be free. When we arm the slaves we abolish slavery."
</p>
<p>On March 8, 1865, the rebel senate was forced to pass the
</p>
<p>following bill :
</p>
<p>The bill was then passed by yeas and nays as follows :
</p>
<p>Yeas  Messrs. Brown, Burnett, Caperton, Henry, Hunter,
</p>
<p>Oldham, Semmes of Louisiana, Sims of Kentucky, Watson  9.
</p>
<p>Nats  Messrs. Barnwell, Graham, Johnson of Georgia,
</p>
<p>Johnson of Missouri, Maxwell, Orr, West, Wigfall  8.
</p>
<p>On motion of Mr. Graham, the Senate resolved itself into
</p>
<p>executive session.
</p>
<p>The following is the bill to place negroes in the army, as it
</p>
<p>passed the Senate :
</p>
<p>A bill to Increase the Military Force of the Confederate States.
</p>
<p>The Congress of the Confederate States of America do enact :
</p>
<p>That in order to provide additional forces to repel invasion, main
</p>
<p>tain the right to possession of the Confederate States, secure their
</p>
<p>independence and preserve their institutions, the President be and
</p>
<p>he is hereby authorized to ask for and accept from the owners of
</p>
<p>slaves the service of such number of able-bodied men as he may
</p>
<p>deem expedient, for and during the war, to perform military ser
</p>
<p>vice in whatever capacity he may direct.
</p>
<p>Sec 2. That the General-in-Chief be authorized to organize the
</p>
<p>said slaves into companies, battalions, regiments and brigades,
</p>
<p>under such rules and regulations as the Secretary of War may
</p>
<p>prescribe, and to be commanded by such officers as the President
</p>
<p>may appoint.
</p>
<p>Sec 3. That while employed in the service, the said troops shall
</p>
<p>receive the same rations, clothing and compensation as are allowed
</p>
<p>to other troops in the same branch of the service.
</p>
<p>Sec 4. That if, under the previous sections of this act, the Pres
</p>
<p>ident shall not be able to raise a sufficient number of troops to
</p>
<p>prosecute the war successfully, and maintain the sovereignty of the
</p>
<p>States and the independence of the Confederate States, then he is

</p>
<p>pedient, for her quota of three hundred thousand troops, in addi
</p>
<p>tion to those subject to military service under existing laws, or as
</p>
<p>many thereof as the President may deem necessary to be raised
</p>
<p>from such classes of the population, irrespective of color, in each
</p>
<p>State, as the proper authorities thereof may determine ; Provided,
</p>
<p>144 THE UNION CAMPAIGN.
</p>
<p>that no more than 25 per Cent, of the male slaves between the
</p>
<p>ages of 18 and 45 in any State shall be called for under the pro
</p>
<p>visions of this act. ._
</p>
<p>Sec. 5. That nothing in this act shall be construed to authorize
</p>
<p>a change in the relation which the said slaves shall bear towards
</p>
<p>their owners, except by the consent of the owners and of the
</p>
<p>States in which they may reside, and in pursuance of the laws
</p>
<p>thereof. The same cause that produced the rupture in the Union, is
</p>
<p>now a source of strife between the slave-breeding and the
</p>
<p>slave-buying States. The border States having already lost'
</p>
<p>all for the sake of slavery, now discover that the Gulf States
</p>
<p>are unwilling to make the same sacrifice. Independence, if it
</p>
<p>has to be acquired by abolition, is not wanted by the Gulf
</p>
<p>States. Mr. Hunter of Virginia, remarked in discussing the
</p>
<p>passage of the negro soldier bill in the rebel Congress :
</p>
<p>" When we left the old government, I thought we had got
</p>
<p>rid forever of the slavery agitation, that we were ' entering a
</p>
<p>new confederacy of homogeneous States upon the agitation of
</p>
<p>the slavery question, which had become intolerable under the
</p>
<p>old Union, was to have no place; but to my surprise I find that
</p>
<p>this government assumes the power to arm the slaves, which
</p>
<p>involves also the power of emancipation, to the agitation of
</p>
<p>this question; the assumption of this power, I date the origin
</p>
<p>of this gloom which overspreads our people. * * * It is
</p>
<p>a clear claim of the central government to emancipate the
</p>
<p>slaves  if we are right in passing this measure we were wrong
</p>
<p>in denying to the old government the right to interfere with
</p>
<p>the institution of slavery, and to emancipate slaves ; besides if
</p>
<p>we offer slaves their freedom as a boon, we confess that we
</p>
<p>were insincere, were hypocritical in asserting that slavery
</p>
<p>was the best state for the negroes themselves. * * * *
</p>
<p>I consider the adoption of the measure as almost a virtual aban.
</p>
<p>donment of the principles of the contest."
</p>
<p>Thus the reader can see the importance of Mr. Lincoln's
</p>
<p>course  first freeing, then arming the slaves. Politically these

<p>measures have ground the Confederacy to powder.
</p>
<p>The Union party had followed Mr. Lincoln to an elevated
</p>
<p>THE UNION CAMPAIGN. 145
</p>
<p>position : they had every advantage, in a moral sense, over their
</p>
<p>opponents, and could look down upon them revelling in their
</p>
<p>filthy vacillating political attire.
</p>
<p>The Union party fought the political battle fair and square.
</p>
<p>It had no secrets to hide, but trusted all to the intelligence
</p>
<p>and virtue of jibe American people ; its press and orators
</p>
<p>exposed the rottenness of their opponents ; that the entire
</p>
<p>party was without one redeeming trait, and clearly demon
</p>
<p>strated it to be only the northern and cowardly wing of the Re
</p>
<p>bellion. All the beat qualities of human nature were appealed
</p>
<p>to. As to authority, they held to our Government from the
</p>
<p>Lakes to the Gulf, and that Government to guarantee and pro
</p>
<p>tect within its jurisdiction, without distinction of race or color
</p>
<p>the liberty of man. One emblem, to represent it, and that the
</p>
<p>good old flag of our fathers, ." the star-spangled banner," Men
</p>
<p>were constantly appealed to, to respect the rights of man, to
</p>
<p>act politically towards others as you would have others act
</p>
<p>towards you, to vindicate the national authority and honor,
</p>
<p>respect for the Constitution, and respect for even-handed jus
</p>
<p>tice, a sacerdotal reverence fox the illustrious dead who fell
</p>
<p>in defense of the Government and, flag  with a high appre
</p>
<p>ciation of the valiant services of the gallant officers and brave
</p>
<p>men who had been and were yet in their country's service.
</p>
<p>Everything that was elevating to an American citizen, every
</p>
<p>thing that was calculated to swell the manly heart, and light
</p>
<p>up ;the human soul, with a perfect disregard of self, men acted
</p>
<p>reckless of present consequences  they acted for posterity
</p>
<p>This question had to be met some time, and they resolved to
</p>
<p>meet it then. Among the soldiers and sailors, all appeared to
</p>
<p>be animated with the spirit of patriotism and success ; they all
</p>
<p>knew that on them depended the salvation of their country 
</p>
<p>they achieved victory, and thank God the nation still lives.
</p>
<p>It has passed through a crisis more beset with peril than ever
</p>
<p>experienced before. Independence is the child of Washington
</p>
<p> but Lincoln is the father of Freedom.

<p>man has struggled with tyranny. Defeated one day, he re

<p>news the conflict the next, until the struggle continues from
</p>
<p>father to son, from generation to generation. The tyranny of

<p>man is the bane of civilization -, its demands, no matter how

<p>unjust, like the yawning grave, can never be satisfied. The
</p>
<p>tyrant who wades through blood and slaughter to a throne, in

</p>
<p>harmonize with nature and the divine will, and are the bul

<p>warks of civilization. Without them popular government
</p>
<p>would be only anarchy. They are the sentinels on the watch-
</p>
<p>towers of Freedom, the richest jewels of Republican civili
</p>
<p>zation. A government sparkling all over with these Chris
</p>
<p>tian diadems would be as fixed and lasting as the firmament,
</p>
<p>while its dazzling splendor would sparkle throughout all time.
</p>
<p>Providence had reserved its richest earthly inheritance as a
</p>
<p>place of refuge from the tyranny of kings.
</p>
<p>Here in America, was to be developed the Christian doc
</p>
<p>trine of the brotherhood of man. The Anglo Saxon in 1620,
</p>
<p>with his ideas of liberty, landed at Plymouth Rock ; while
</p>
<p>the Norman, with his Feudalism, in 1607, had settled on the
</p>
<p>James. The Dutch, in 1609, with their peculiar ideas of lib
</p>
<p>erty for the white man, settled on the Hudson. When these
</p>
<p>different colonies began to increase and spread over an ex
</p>
<p>tended surface, necessity in government, as in everything
</p>
<p>else, became the mother of invention. In order more effect
</p>
<p>ually to protect the Colonies against depredations from the
</p>
<p>Indian tribes, the Anglo Saxon descendants of the Pilgrims,
</p>
<p>inhabiting Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut and New Ha
</p>
<p>ven, while owing allegiance to the British Crown, in 1643,
</p>
<p>formed themselves into a League, styled the United Colonies of
</p>
<p>New England. The object of this association was self-protec
</p>
<p>tion. It lasted upwards of forty years, and was the first idea
</p>
<p>of Union that our history gives any account of. This League
</p>
<p>was dissolved by King James in lo86.
</p>
<p>The next account we have of an effort to renew the League,
</p>
<p>was a Convention at Albany in 1722 ; then, again, on a more
</p>
<p>extended scale at the same place, in 1754. The dread by the
</p>
<p>mother country of a war with France, was what brought this
</p>
<p>Convention together. It was to devise means to protect Amer
</p>
<p>ica, by making treaties with the Indian tribes to prevent
</p>
<p>them, if possible, from enlisting under the banner of the

<p>French. This Union was to embrace all the Colonies, from

<p>Franklin, in 1761, remarked that only some grievous tyranny
</p>
<p>could force a Union.  Kent's Historical Lectures, 1795.
</p>
<p>The Stamp Act of the British Government ordained that no
</p>
<p>sale, bond, note of hand, or other instrument of writing, shall
</p>
<p>be Valid unless executed on paper bearing the stamp pre
</p>
<p>scribed by the home government. This received the royal
</p>
<p>assent, March 23, 1765, and on the 7th October, same year,
</p>
<p>twenty-seven delegates met in New York to implore relief.
</p>
<p>This assemblage is known in history as the Congress of 1765.
</p>
<p>The assembly claimed that the right to tax the Colonies re
</p>
<p>sided in the colonial ' Legislatures. "The eloquence of Wm.
</p>
<p>Pitt and Lord Camden brought about the repeal of the Stamp
</p>
<p>Act in the British Parliament. But a new Ministry in 1767,
</p>
<p>succeeded in getting through the House of Commons a bill to
</p>
<p>tax the tea imported into the American Colonies, which re-
</p>
<p>' ceived the royal assent.
</p>
<p>At this last imposition the feelings of the Colonies began
</p>
<p>to grow hot. Lord North was now at the head of affairs,
</p>
<p>and he determined to show them no leniency. Enthusiastic
</p>
<p>meetings were held in Boston, Mass., in the latter part of the
</p>
<p>year 1769, which foreshadowed the coming struggle.
</p>
<p>In 1620 slavery had been ' introduced into Virginia by the
</p>
<p>Dutch, and, like the small-pox, it soon spread throughout the

<p>Colonies. One hundred and thirty years after, the Boston

<p>Twenty years after the foregoing advertisement appeared,

<p>AMERICAN UNION. 149
</p>
<p>the fires of the Revolution began to burn. British troops
</p>
<p>were being concentrated in Boston, to extinguish the flame
</p>
<p>with patriotic blood. On the 5th of March, 1770, Captain
</p>
<p>Preston, with a body of red coats, tried to preserve order.
</p>
<p>At Doek Square and the Custom House, large crowds were to
</p>
<p>be seen throughout the day, eager to take part in the coming
</p>
<p>contest. The sun had sunk below the horizon, and the shad
</p>
<p>ows of the night, so big with fate, had already approached.
</p>
<p>The lamps in Dock Square were lit, and threw their light in
</p>
<p>the angry faces of the discontented crowd, who only waited
</p>
<p>to be led against the British troops. A part of Captain Pres
</p>
<p>ton's company, while making their way from the Custom House,
</p>
<p>were met by the crowd from Dock Square, headed by the
</p>
<p>black man, the slave, Crispus Attacks, who, with a shout of
</p>
<p>defiance, cried : "Let us drive these rebels away ; they have
</p>
<p>no business here." The crowd followed their enthusiastic
</p>
<p>leader, when the soldiers under Preston appeared to give
</p>
<p>way. Attacks, seeing this, became more daring, urging his
</p>
<p>followers not to be afraid, but to come on, " They dare not
</p>
<p>shoot; we'll drive them out of Boston." These were the last -
</p>
<p>words heard from his lips. Two balls, from British muskets,
</p>
<p>pierced his sable breast. The sharp crack of the musket
</p>
<p>drowned his patriotic voice, and Crispus Attucks, the runaway
</p>
<p>slave, became the first martyr to American liberty. Thus
</p>
<p>was inaugurated the Revolution, which took the brightest
</p>
<p>jewel from the British Crown. There was force in the re
</p>
<p>mark of the Earl of Shelburne, when, in his reply to the Duke
</p>
<p>of Richmond, he said : " The sun qf Great Britain will set

<p>whenever she geknou>ledges tlw Independence qf America,
</p>
<p>The flames of discontent began to increase after the mas

<p>150 ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE
</p>
<p>The colonies had not yet chosen a Commander-in-chief, and
</p>
<p>it was while in session in Philadelphia, on June 15th, 1775, 
</p>
<p>that George Washington was nominated, by Thomas Johnson,
</p>
<p>of Maryland, and was unanimously chosen. Washington
</p>
<p>owed his appointment to the New England delegation, headed
</p>
<p>by John Adams.  Statesman's Manual, vol. I, page 55.
</p>
<p>Four days after his appointment Washington received his
</p>
<p>Commission, and on the 20th of June he left Philadelphia to
</p>
<p>join the Continental army, at Cambridge, near Boston, Mass.
</p>
<p>The battle of Bunker's Hill, June 17th, 1775, was fought be
</p>
<p>fore Washington arrived in Massachusetts. Prescott was the
</p>
<p>American commander ; his loss was 453. British commanded
</p>
<p>by Howe, loss 1054. On July 2d, Washington arrived at Cam
</p>
<p>bridge, and took command of the army. All the foregoing
</p>
<p>engagements were fought before his arrival. General Mont
</p>
<p>gomery was master of Montreal, and Col. Arnold was organ
</p>
<p>izing, at Newburyport, a company of one thousand men to
</p>
<p>march on Quebec. Among his band of patriots were many
</p>
<p>bold and daring men, one of the most conspicuous of whom
</p>
<p>was Aaron Burr, a lad of great promise, not yet twenty years
</p>
<p>of age. He came from Litchfield, Connecticut, where he had
</p>
<p>for a short time been reading law, with Mr. Tappin Reeve.
</p>
<p>On the 20th of September, 1775, Col. Arnold, with eleven

<p>on its way to Quebec. For thirty-two days they saw no
</p>
<p>trace of a human being. Starvation came, and they were

<p>forced to live upon dogs, reptiles, and even devoured the

</p>
<p>young Catholic Priest. In this manner, with his knowledge
</p>
<p>of Latin, he was enabled to deceive priests and people. He
</p>
<p>was conducted by his guide from one religious family to an
</p>
<p>other. At Three Rivers suspicion became aroused, and the
</p>
<p>guide, fearing the consequences, refused to proceed. Burr
</p>
<p>was concealed for three days in a convent at Three Rivers, at
</p>
<p>the end of which time the guide, without further trouble,
</p>
<p>conducted him to Montreal. The gallant Irishman, Mont
</p>
<p>gomery, was so delighted with Burr that he placed him on his
</p>
<p>staff, as general's aid-de-camp, with the rank of captain. It
</p>
<p>was now the month of November, and the ground was cov
</p>
<p>ered with snow; yet Montgomery set out with 300 men, him
</p>
<p>self at their head, and reached Arnold's camp, before Quebec,
</p>
<p>in the early part of December.
</p>
<p>On the 20th of the month all was ready, and on the 31st,
</p>
<p>amid the chilling ice and northeasterly snow storm, which
</p>
<p>served to drive even animals created for these climes
</p>
<p>to their accustomed retreats, leaving the patriotic band
</p>
<p>unprotected in the dead of night, to brave the dreadful
</p>
<p>weather. Just before the day dawned Montgomery, with
</p>
<p>Burr at his side, moved to the attack. As the column began
</p>
<p>to move Montgomery cried, " Push on, brave boys, Quebec is
</p>
<p>ours!" The column advanced up to within forty paces of the
</p>
<p>block house. At first, the British troops, mostly composed of
</p>
<p>sailors and militia, fled in terror from the guns. The Ameri
</p>
<p>can army, not understanding how matters stood, was slow to
</p>
<p>move, when a sailor, to discover the reason, ventured back.
</p>
<p>He saw through the port holes of the block house the ad
</p>
<p>vancing party, and turned to run. Before leaving, his dusky
</p>
<p>form stood trembling, as if chained by demons to the spot to
</p>
<p>wait till fate came up. He fired the grape-charged 12-pound
</p>
<p>cannon, and the great Montgomery fell, who, with two of his
</p>
<p>aids and an orderly sergeant, never again saw the light of the
</p>
<p>sun. The column, aware of the loss, halted and wavered.
</p>
<p>Burr made an effort to rally the men, but the enemy opened

<p>seized and shouldered up his glorious load, and, ainid snow

<p>pursuit. The weight was too great, and little Burr was com

<p>pelled to drop his' priceless treasure in the snow.
</p>
<p>The American force remained in Canada, annoying the gar

<p>rison at Q'uebec till the spring of 1776, when they had to
</p>
<p>retire before the new army under Burgoyne. In the mean
</p>
<p>time, on the 17th of March, the British evacuated Boston.
</p>
<p>General Washington had gathered about 20,000 men, and on
</p>
<p>the 2d of March commenced a heavy cannonading on the
</p>
<p>British lines. General Howe had made arrangements in Feb
</p>
<p>ruary to evacuate. His army was about 10,000 strong, with
</p>
<p>about 1,000 Tories. In seventy-eight' ships and transports
</p>
<p>they sailed for Halifax. General Washington, fearing Howe
</p>
<p>had sailed for New York, immediately directed the army to
</p>
<p>march. The Legislature of Massachusetts, and the Continen
</p>
<p>tal Congress, both congratulated Washington on the glorious
</p>
<p>termination of the siege of Boston.
</p>
<p>The military operations thus far had been in favor of the

<p>ruin ; but she stuck to him through every adversity, and

<p>shared with him the fate of his treason and disgrace. At West

</p>
<p>The definite Treaty was signed September 30tb, 1783 ; after

<p>which it was officially proclaimed by Congress, and announced
</p>
<p>by Washington to the army, October 18, 1783, wherein was

<p>declared the Independence of the United States. It was first

<p>acknowledged by France ; then by Holland, on the 19th of

</p>
<p>The entire population of the thirteen Colonies, in 1790, was
</p>
<p>3,043,000. During the .trying times of the Revolution, and in
</p>
<p>order to assist in achieving American Independence, Articles
</p>
<p>of Confederation were adopted at Philadelphia in 1778. This
</p>
<p>League adopted United States of America as the style of the
</p>
<p>Confederacy. It was simply a Union for defence ; as the 2d
</p>
<p>Article asserts that each State retains its sovereignty : not a
</p>
<p>new government, but an agreement between old ones for gen
</p>
<p>eral protection against foreign powers. They took the model
</p>
<p>from the Batavian and Helvetic Confederacies. It lasted only
</p>
<p>ten years, and served as a temporary preservation of society ;
</p>
<p>but the wise saw that it could not be durable. Witnout suffi

<p>cient power for self-protection, foreign powers looiced upon it
</p>
<p>with contempt. The disputes of the States, and bitter wrang
</p>

<p>with the Crown Lands, caused them' to view the League with

<p>a jealous eye. Maryland refused to sign the Articles of Con

</p>
<p>after Congress had declared their adoption was essential to

<p>claiming disunion, and threatening insurrection. From 1643
</p>
<p>to 1778 all efforts of the Colonies to continue united, after the
</p>
<p>dangers calling them together had passed, were ineffectual ;
</p>
<p>and this last effort at harmonizing rival sovereignties, under
</p>
<p>the Articles of Confederation, after less than ten years of pre
</p>
<p>carious existence, sickened and died of the same malady.
</p>
<p>Hamilton, Madison, and Jay saw the defects. Washington
</p>
<p>himself was pained to see that .after the sacrifices he and his
</p>
<p>gallant army had made on the many bloody battle-fields,
</p>
<p>through a seven years' war, to gain independence, his country,
</p>
<p>which had emblazoned on its victorious banner the sacred
</p>
<p>rights of human nature, was now engaged in quarreling over
</p>
<p>supposed rights of petty sovereignties, and refusing to do justice
</p>
<p>to the surviving patriots of the Revolution. The Revolution
</p>
<p>ary period, which should date from the 5th of November,
</p>
<p>1770, lasted to the first of the same month, 1781. The League,
</p>
<p>which terminated March 4, 1789, was now to be followed by
</p>
<p>the formation of a National Government. The Union itself was
</p>
<p>in the agonies of death.
</p>
<p>To remedy the evils that were every day accumulating, a
</p>
<p>Convention was called to meet at Annapolis, Md., in Septem
</p>
<p>ber, 1786. Five States only sent delegates. They adjourned
</p>
<p>to meet delegates from all the States, in Philadelphia, on the
</p>
<p>second Monday of May, 1787.
</p>
<p>State sovereignty had already denied and shoved aside the
</p>
<p>truths of the Declaration of Independence, and broken the
</p>
<p>bond of Union established in 1778. The corpse was there,
</p>
<p>but its spirit had fled. The address adopted by the Annapolis
</p>
<p>Convention, and addressed to the Legislatures of the different
</p>
<p>States, represented in the Convention, spoke of the dangers
</p>
<p>which threatened them, as follows : " They are, however, of a
</p>
<p>nature so serious, as, in the view of your Commissioners, renders
</p>
<p>the situation of the United States delicate and critical, calling
</p>
<p>for an exertion of the united virtue and wisdom of all the
</p>
<p>members of the Confederacy."

<p>The Convention assembling at Philadelphia was itself
</p>
<p>the creation of State sovereignty, appointed by the Legis-
</p>
<p>156 ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE
</p>
<p>latures of the different States. They did not emanate from
</p>
<p>the people, but from the same source as did the members that
</p>
<p>formed the League of 1778 ; and many of the members wanted
</p>
<p>to substitute for the Constitution the old Articles of Confed
</p>
<p>eration, with additional power to Congress.
</p>
<p>Some of the delegates were determined that the new gov
</p>
<p>ernment should, like the Declaration of Independence, emanate
</p>
<p>directly from the people, and that State sovereignty, that had
</p>
<p>proved the death of all previous Unions, should not form the
</p>
<p>basis of this now about to be established. Washington was
</p>
<p>chosen president, and the Convention continued in session
</p>
<p>about four months.
</p>
<p>Thus the Federalists, to get rid of State sovereignty, and
</p>
<p>establish a strong government, set forth in the preamble to
</p>
<p>tbe Constitution, that " We, the people qf the United States, in
</p>
<p>order to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, insure do
</p>
<p>mestic tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the
</p>
<p>general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves
</p>
<p>and posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the
</p>
<p>United States qf America.
</p>
<p>The Anti-Federalists and States' Rights party contended
</p>
<p>that the preamble should read : " We, the States of New Jer
</p>
<p>sey, Virgima, South Ca-rolma, &c, in order to form a more per
</p>
<p>fect Union," &c.
</p>
<p>Judicial Constructions.  " The Constitution of the United
</p>
<p>States was ordained and established, not by the United States
</p>
<p>in their sovereign capacity, but, as the preamble declares, by
</p>
<p>the people of the United States."  History and Analysis of the
</p>
<p>Constitution, by Towle, page 39.
</p>
<p>The Federalists gained a great point in announcing that the
</p>
<p>instrument had been made by the people for the States. Their
</p>
<p>opponents wanted it understood that it was made by the
</p>
<p>States for the people.

<p>But, notwithstanding the important position gained by the

<p>Burr, whatever faults he had, was clear ^headed. :" It lasted

<p>just twenty-four years longer than he first predicted. It

</p>
<p>While the Federal party, headed by Washington, Hamilton,

</p>
<p>and the United States, formed a leading element of discord,
</p>
<p>and helped to bring about the wretched condition of the
</p>
<p>country. This question, that had done so much to make disaffection
</p>
<p>under the League, was happily settled by ceding all the Ter
</p>
<p>ritories belonging to the several States to the General Gov
</p>
<p>ernment, and is known as the Ordinance of 1787. It was
</p>
<p>passed two months and four days before the adoption of the
</p>
<p>Constitution. Thirteen sovereignties, with an organized militia, and all
</p>
<p>the paraphernalia of independent authority, like jealous

<p>to give capital thus invested in human flesh and blood a repre

<p>sentation in Congress, while that invested in lands, tenements,
</p>
<p>and merchandize, was denied the same advantage, proved to
</p>
<p>be the deadly weapon which our fathers left in the temple.
</p>
<p>It has long been in dispute ; and at last was seized by the

<p>mighty fabric, the American Union.

<p>Thomas Jefferson was ambassador to France from 1785 to

</p>
<p>for President, and John Adams as a candidate for Vice Presi

<p>in the Presidential election. New York, North Carolina, and

<p>for President in 1789. Seven candidates ran, but received but

<p>President of the United States. This harmless declaration
</p>
<p>AMERICAN UNION. 159
</p>
<p>was caught up by the Anti-Federalists, and construed to inti
</p>
<p>mate a desire on the part of the Federalists to make Washing
</p>
<p>ton King.
</p>
<p>During his first term the Constitution, that had been so
</p>
<p>lately opposed, was growing in favor, and the Anti-Federal
</p>
<p>party becoming unpopular. They had become odious as Anti-
</p>
<p>Federalists, and, at the election of 1793, called themselves Re
</p>
<p>publicans. They had strong affinities towards the French
</p>
<p>Revolutionists, as the change in their name indicated.
</p>
<p>Hamilton, who was an able man and a strong Federalist,
</p>
<p>was represented to have a high opinion of the British system,
</p>
<p>or what Burke called the British Constitution. This supposed
</p>
<p>affinity of leading Federalists with British institutions told
</p>
<p>hard against the party, and Washington's second term was a
</p>
<p>stormy one. Old opponents of the Federal party, by denounc
</p>
<p>ing it as the party of monarchy, had acquired considerable
</p>
<p>strength under their new name. Washington issued two
</p>
<p>proclamations in August and September, 1794, to warn the
</p>
<p>whisky insurrectionists of Western Pennsylvania (Washington
</p>
<p>and Allegheny counties.) This arrayed against him the whisky
</p>
<p>boys generally, aud it was with difficulty that many of the
</p>
<p>most important measures of the administration were carried.
</p>
<p>The average annual expense of his administration was
</p>
<p>$1,986,588. The seat of government was now in Philar
</p>
<p>delphia. Adams, the Federalist, was elected as Washington's suc
</p>
<p>cessor in 1797, but with only three majority over Jefferson,
</p>
<p>the Republican, who became the Vice President. Mr. Adams,
</p>
<p>though absent when the Constitution was made, and first see
</p>
<p>ing it in a foreign country, said : " It was not then, nor has it
</p>
<p>been since, any objection, in my mind, that the Executive and Sen
</p>
<p>ate were not more permanent."  Inaugural Address, March 4,
</p>
<p>1797. During his administration there were precautionary
</p>
<p>measures taken to meet a French war. The alien and sedition
</p>
<p>laws were passed by Congress in the summer of 1798. The
</p>
<p>alien law empowered the President to order aliens who were

<p>supposed to be in conspiracy against the United States to de-
</p>
<p>160 ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE
</p>
<p>part from its territories. The sedition law, it was claimed,
</p>
<p>restricted the liberty of speech and the press. With these
</p>
<p>unpopular measures, and disaffection among his Cabinet offi
</p>
<p>cers, Hamilton came out against him, and threw his influence
</p>
<p>in favor of Pinckney. This, with other unfortunate combina
</p>
<p>tions, secured his defeat for a second term.
</p>
<p>Bradford's History remarks : " By the prudent and pacific,
</p>
<p>yet firm , and decided measures of the Federal Government
</p>
<p>for twelve years, the character of the: United, States had he-
</p>
<p>come highly respectable among the greatest statesmen of s Eu
</p>
<p>rope. Its policy exhibited a .happy union of energy and .mag
</p>
<p>nanimity, and it was respected alike for its wisdom, and power.
</p>
<p>The nation was placed in a commanding attitude of defence,
</p>
<p>while liberty, peace, and improvement were everywhere wit
</p>
<p>nessed within its jurisdiction. Public credit had been fully
</p>
<p>established, and able and faithful men had been selected for
</p>
<p>public ; agents  men whose patriotism had been proved by
</p>
<p>eight years service devoted to their country's welfare."
</p>
<p>The Republican party, which had so dreaded centralization
</p>
<p>and monarchy, became tired of the old system of State Legis
</p>
<p>latures indicating Presidential candidates. They snatched this
</p>
<p>small perquisite, and introduced, in Philadelphia, in 1800, the
</p>
<p>aristocratic system of -nominating Presidential candidates by
</p>
<p>Congressional caucus. 37 Representatives and 9 Senators thus
</p>
<p>met and nominated Jefferson for President and Aaron Burr
</p>
<p>for Vice President. Thus the party that so much dreaded
</p>
<p>Federal power and centralization was the first to use it to dic
</p>
<p>tate to the States Presidential candidates. The election re
</p>
<p>sulted in favor of the caucus nomination. Jefferson and Burr
</p>
<p>had each 73 electoral votes. Adams, the Federalist candidate,
</p>
<p>had only 65, and was beaten. The House of Representatives
</p>
<p>continued to ballot from February 11th to the 17th (six days)
</p>
<p>to determine whether Jefferson or Burr should be President.
</p>
<p>This bold attempt by a party in the House of Representatives
</p>
<p>to counteract and resist the clearly expressed will of the peo

<p>ple led to the adoption, of this amendment : " The time for the
</p>
<p>meeting of the electors is the first Wednesday in December,
</p>
<p>AMERICAN UNION. 161
</p>
<p>and the time for counting the votes is the second Wednesday
</p>
<p>in February." 1 Stat 239.
</p>
<p>Many of the Federalists went over to the support of Burr,
</p>
<p>believing that more might be expected in that direction than
</p>
<p>from Jefferson. Burr would have secured the election with
</p>
<p>out any effort on his part, if it had not been for Hamilton op
</p>
<p>posing him. He might have secured it, even against Hamil
</p>
<p>ton's influence, if he had went into the contest himself, but he
</p>
<p>remained at Albany all the time during the balloting, and
</p>
<p>there does not remain any evidence that he ever solicited a
</p>
<p>single vote. He was charged with intriguing to secure the
</p>
<p>votes of New Jersey, Vermont, and Rhode Island. Matthew
</p>
<p>Lyon declared that John Brown, of Rhode Island, Urged him
</p>
<p>to vote for Colonel Burr, using these words : " What is it you
</p>
<p>want, Colonel Lyon ? Is it office ? Is it money ? Say what
</p>
<p>you want, and you shall have it." But Judge Cooper, in a let?
</p>
<p>ter to Mr. Morris, February 12, declares s " Had Burr done
</p>
<p>anything for himself, he would long ere this have been Presi-.
</p>
<p>dent." Parton's Life qf Burr, p. 289. i
</p>
<p>Colonel Burr, on the 16th of December, 1800, addressed a
</p>
<p>letter to Gen. S. Smith, of Baltimore, then a member of the
</p>
<p>House of Representatives, in which he disclaimed all compe
</p>
<p>tition with Jefferson : " As to my friends," he says, " they
</p>
<p>would dishonor my views and insult my feelings by a suspicion
</p>
<p>that I would submit to be instrumental in counteracting the
</p>
<p>rules and expectations of the United States."  Statesman's
</p>
<p>Manual, page 313.
</p>
<p>It was Jefferson's enemies, and not Aaron Burr that tried
</p>
<p>to defeat the will of the nation.
</p>
<p>The National Government had now been moved from Phil
</p>
<p>adelphia to Washington. In 1796 there had sprung up in the
</p>
<p>West and South-west a party which favored separation of that
</p>
<p>Territory from the Union. Among the most prominent mem
</p>
<p>bers was Gen. Wilkinson, the Commander-in-chief of the

</p>
<p>162 ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE
</p>
<p>contended in the courts. When Jefferson came into office he
</p>
<p>was in the 58th year of his age. His election had been se
</p>
<p>cured by bitter party strife. There were, at this period, pub
</p>
<p>lished in the United States, about 180 newspapers, controlled
</p>
<p>mostly by aliens. The reaction in the tone of the press against
</p>
<p>Mr. Adams, on account of the alien and sedition laws, was
</p>
<p>like an avalanche.
</p>
<p>Most of the officers of the General Government had received
</p>
<p>their appointment from Washington. Mr. Adams removed
</p>
<p>scarcely any during his term of office. Mr. Jefferson began
</p>
<p>his administration under these peculiar circumstances, and
</p>
<p>commenced to turn out Federalists and put Republicans in
</p>
<p>their places. This soon had the effect of making speedy con
</p>
<p>versions of Federal office-holders, who suddenly became Re
</p>
<p>publicans for the sake of office.
</p>
<p>In 1795, Spain had granted the right to the United States
</p>
<p>of making New Orleans a place of deposit for three years,
</p>
<p>with an agreement to renew in 1802. The Spanish Intendant
</p>
<p>declared, by proclamation, that the right no longer existed.
</p>
<p>This caused a furore of excitement in the Western States,
</p>
<p>and along the valley of the Mississippi and its tributaries.
</p>
<p>Congress was beset with petitions of grievances. The ex
</p>
<p>citement was brought to its full height in December, 1802,
</p>
<p>when Jefferson, in his annual message, first communicated to
</p>
<p>Congress that Spain had ceded Louisiana to France. A pecu
</p>
<p>liar combination of circumstances surrounded this Louisiana
</p>
<p>question. Few of the statesmen at that time thought it politic
</p>
<p>to enlarge the area of the national domain. It was the need
</p>
<p>of a free outlet to our commerce that influenced the adminis
</p>
<p>tration. Livingston, our Minister at Paris, advised the seizure
</p>
<p>of New Orleans by force, as he thought it could never be ac
</p>
<p>quired by treaty.
</p>
<p>Napoleon Bonaparte was then Consul of France, and his
</p>
<p>country was about embarking in a war with England. It was
</p>
<p>made known to him that if this arrangement of ceding New

<p>Orleans was not carried out, the United States would be
</p>
<p>forced to make an alliance with Great Britain. When this
</p>
<p>AMERICAN UNION. 163
</p>
<p>was understood, Napoleon ordered the Marquis de Marbois
</p>
<p>to negotiate with the American Minister. They, who were
</p>
<p>only negotiating for New Orleans and its surroundings, and
</p>
<p>the right to navigate the river, were surprised when the Mar
</p>
<p>quis de Marbois told them he was ready to treat for Louisiana.
</p>
<p>The Treaty was concluded April 30, 1803, and signed by the
</p>
<p>Ministers, Mr. Livingston and Mr. Monroe, on the part of the
</p>
<p>United States, and the Marquis de Marbois on the part of
</p>
<p>France, four days afterwards. The price paid by the Ameri
</p>
<p>can Government was $15,000,000.
</p>
<p>Napoleon remarked : " This accession of territory strengthens
</p>
<p>forever tlve power of the United States, and I have just given to
</p>
<p>England a maritime rival that will sooner or later humble her
</p>
<p>pride." The area of the country ceded was estimated to ex
</p>
<p>ceed a million square miles. The inhabitants were mostly In
</p>
<p>dians, except about 90,000 French and their descendants,
</p>
<p>Spanish, English, Germans, and Americans, owning about 40,-
</p>
<p>000 slaves. Hostilities between England and France com
</p>
<p>menced on the 22d of May, 1803. On that very day Bonaparte,
</p>
<p>without waiting for the United States, ratified the Louisiana
</p>
<p>Treaty. Captains Lewis and Clarke were sent on an expedition to
</p>
<p>the new Territories. On the 14th of May, 1804, they left the
</p>
<p>banks of the Mississippi. The party consisted of about thirty
</p>
<p>persons, and were absent two years and three months.
</p>
<p>The excitement attending Jefferson's first election was
</p>
<p>sought as a pretext to amend the Constitution, so as to desig
</p>
<p>nate which person was voted for as President, and which as
</p>
<p>Vice President. The Federal party opposed it, alleging that
</p>
<p>the Constitution contemplated that two persons equally qual
</p>
<p>ified for the office of Chief Magistrate should be voted for.
</p>
<p>But the amendment was agreed to by the votes of two-thirds
</p>
<p>of the members of Congress, and was ratified by the Legis
</p>
<p>latures of three-fourths of the States. Massachusetts, Dela
</p>
<p>ware and Connecticut disapproved of the change. It forms

<p>Aaron Burr, Vice President, who had produced so much ex.
</p>
<p>164 ORIGIN AND HISTORY OP THE
</p>
<p>citement at the outset of Jefferson's administration, had been
</p>
<p>goaded into a quarrel by Alexander Hamilton. Burr was not
</p>
<p>a vicious man, but his antagonist was unscrupulous in the
</p>
<p>means he used to defeat an adversary. Burr sent a challenge
</p>
<p>to Hamilton. It was accepted ; and the duel was fought July
</p>
<p>11, 1804, on the heights of Weehawken, New Jersey. Ham
</p>
<p>ilton fell at the first fire. From this day forward, vituperation
</p>
<p>and calumny followed the name of Aaron Burr.
</p>
<p>Jefferson's first term being very popular with the people,
</p>
<p>he was re-nominated for a second term. Vice President Burr,
</p>
<p>having lost the confidence of the Republican leaders, was
</p>
<p>shoved aside, and George Clinton, of New York, was placed
</p>
<p>on the ticket. Pinckney, of South Carolina, for President,
</p>
<p>and Rufus King, of New York, for Vice President, were the
</p>
<p>Federal candidates. The people sustained Jefferson's admin
</p>
<p>istration, and he was triumphantly re-elected. The caucus
</p>
<p>system, that had been introduced by the Republican leaders
</p>
<p>for nominating candidates for President and Vice President,
</p>
<p>was now used by them to control Congress. The most
</p>
<p>important measures had previously been agreed upon by the
</p>
<p>Republican members in private caucus, before they came be
</p>
<p>fore that body. An effort was made by Jefferson, in the
</p>
<p>latter part of his first term, and the commencement of his
</p>
<p>second, in 1805, to purchase Florida from Spain, but it did
</p>
<p>not succeed. Efforts were renewed in 1817, and finally car
</p>
<p>ried to a successful termination on February 19, 1821.
</p>
<p>It was in the latter half of the year 1805, that Aaron Burr,
</p>
<p>chagrined at the bad treatment he had received at the hands
</p>
<p>of Federal and Republican politicians, which had now been
</p>
<p>renewed with great effect on account of his duel with Hamil
</p>
<p>ton, charged the monopolizing of all the Federal offices by
</p>
<p>the politicians of Virginia and New England. His enemies
</p>
<p>charged him with creating sectional feeling, and said this was
</p>
<p>seized on by Burr and his associates as a pretext for forming
</p>
<p>a great- Southwestern confederacy or kingdom.

</p>
<p>Burr arrived jto New Orleans on the 25th of June, 1805,
</p>
<p>sixty-seven days from the time he left Philadelphia. General
</p>

</p>
<p>Wilkinson had given him a letter to Mr. Clark, who had al
</p>
<p>ready made a voyage to Vera Cruz, Mexico, to spy out the
</p>
<p>land. Burr remained in New Orleans about three weeks, ar
</p>
<p>ranging with Mr. Clark. He left there in July, and on the
</p>
<p>6th of August reached Nashville, Tennessee, and domiciled
</p>
<p>one week with Andrew Jackson.
</p>
<p>The feeling against the Spanish was very great, and adven
</p>
<p>turers from Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, Georgia, and the Car-
</p>
<p>olinas, were all to be enriched by the plunder of Spanish
</p>
<p>countries west of the Mississippi river This glittering bribe,
</p>
<p>his enemies said, was held out as an inducement for the West
</p>
<p>ern States to separate from the Union. New Orleans, they
</p>
<p>said, was to be the seat of government or empire.
</p>
<p>Burr purchased 400,000 acres of land on the banks of the
</p>
<p>Washita river, a branch of the Red river, for $40,000, although
</p>
<p>he never paid but $5,000. This was to furnish a place of re-
</p>
<p>dezvous for all the chosen spirits engaged in the enterprise
</p>
<p>to assemble and fortify. Another rendezvous was at Blenner-
</p>
<p>hasset's Island, on the Ohio, a few miles below Marietta. This
</p>
<p>island was named after its occupant, an Irish gentleman, who,
</p>
<p>with a good-natured wife, had made a home in this romantic
</p>
<p>spot. About 500, in all, knew of Burr's plans, and this island
</p>
<p>became a rendezvous for many of the adventurers, until they
</p>
<p>eat Blennerhasset out of house and home. Burr's plans were
</p>
<p>for Blennerhasset to get what men he could together, and
</p>
<p>float down the Ohio in boats building for the purpose at Ma
</p>
<p>rietta, while he and his Tennessee friends would descend the
</p>
<p>Cumberland. But as the time approached Burr was not sus
</p>
<p>tained (perhaps betrayed is the better word) by his leading
</p>
<p>associates. Wilkinson forsook him, and sent Lieutenant Smith
</p>
<p>with a message to President Jefferson. He left camp, at New
</p>
<p>Orleans, October 21, 1806, and delivered the despatches to
</p>
<p>the President, in Washington, on the 25th of November, and
</p>
<p>on the 27th Jefferson issued his proclamation, which created
</p>
<p>intense excitement. Burr's name was not mentioned in the

<p>proclamation. It merely announced that an unlawful enter
</p>
<p>prise was on foot in the Western States, and warned all per
</p>
<p>sons to withdraw from it immediately.
</p>
<p>166 ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE
</p>
<p>Burr's cypher letter to Gen. Wilkinson, and General Eaton's
</p>
<p>testimony, is what convinced the people of the United States
</p>
<p>that Aaron Burr was a traitor. After his arrest, in Mississippi
</p>
<p>Territory, the Grand Jury acquitted him, remarking that
</p>
<p>Aaron Burr had not been guilty of any crime. He was re
</p>
<p>arrested in Alabama, and brought to Richmond, Virginia, in
</p>
<p>May, 1807, when he was again put on trial, which lasted sev
</p>
<p>eral days. Jefferson, always believing that Burr attempted to
</p>
<p>cheat him out of the election of 1800, was anxious to have
</p>
<p>him convicted, but Burr, with his able counsel, so managed
</p>
<p>his case that Judge Marshall charged the Jury in such a way
</p>
<p>that they rendered their verdict : " We, of the Jury, say Aaron
</p>
<p>Burr is not proved to be guilty, under tire indictment, by any evi
</p>
<p>dence submitted to us. We therefore find him not guilty."
</p>
<p>Although Burr was not convicted, he suffered the odium of
</p>
<p>a traitor even until the day of his death. He had fought with
</p>
<p>great bravery to achieve American Independence, and, in his
</p>
<p>early days, was the most promising statesman of his time.
</p>
<p>His great abilities were dreaded by the leaders of both par
</p>
<p>ties, and the unfortunate circumstances oceurring in the bal
</p>
<p>loting for President organized the entire Republican party,
</p>
<p>headed by tbe administration, against him. The fatal duel
</p>
<p>with Hamilton (although the practice was not then unpopular)
</p>
<p>united the Federalists to complete his political ruin. Disap
</p>
<p>pointed and defeated, he became disgusted with what he con
</p>
<p>sidered ingratitude on the part of his country. He conceived
</p>
<p>the idea of revolutionizing Spanish America, and establishing
</p>
<p>a new government over Mexico. His enemies (and they were
</p>
<p>legion) said monarchy was to be the form ; while his intimate
</p>
<p>friends (they were few but ardent) declared he contemplated
</p>
<p>conquest and ultimate union of Mexico with the United States.
</p>
<p>Burr saw that annexation was only a question of time, and
</p>
<p>his calculations, then so novel and startling, have, through the
</p>
<p>annexation of Louisiana, Florida, Texas, New Mexico and Cal
</p>
<p>ifornia, now passed into history. Who of us, in 1865, are so

</p>
<p>Aaron Burr was a statesman. He wanted sea-room. He
</p>
<p>did not believe in the idea df the United States embracing
</p>
<p>only a small strip of land in the centre of the American con
</p>
<p>tinent. He did not, like some others, dread the growth of the
</p>
<p>country, but was ever ready to enlarge its boundaries. His
</p>
<p>effort, in 1775, in company with the gallant Irishman Mont
</p>
<p>gomery, to advance towards the north pole, though defeated
</p>
<p>at Quebec, gives an idea of his intentions when he turned to
</p>
<p>wards the tropics.
</p>
<p>" There is no evidence that Burr meant to sever the West
</p>
<p>ern States from the Union, or desired to do so, nor that he in
</p>
<p>tended to seize New Orleans or any property in it. His pre
</p>
<p>liminary object was Texas ; his ultimate object was the throne
</p>
<p>of Mexico."  Parton's Life qf Burr, page 354.
</p>
<p>The best and strongest evidence of Burr's innocence is the.
</p>
<p>fact that Andrew Jackson was his intimate friend. He went
</p>
<p>all the way to Richmond during Burr's trial, and, in the pub

<p>lic streets, made speeches before thousands, vindicating him

</p>
<p>These remarks have been continued at some length to give'
</p>
<p>the reader the true outlines of the history of the Burr expe
</p>
<p>dition. He was a man that had ideas in advance of his time,
</p>
<p>(he also had faults.) But if he lived at the present day he
</p>
<p>would see most of the country he sought to acquire now be
</p>
<p>longing to the Federal Union. He would also have the pleas
</p>
<p>ure of witnessing Canada, which he and the gallant Mont
</p>
<p>gomery endeavored to rescue from Great Britain, forming a
</p>
<p>Confederacy on its hook and taking the management of its
</p>
<p>affairs into its own hands, which is a preliminary step in the
</p>
<p>right direction. He would have seen the great civil strife,
</p>
<p>which grew out of the imperfections of the Constitution,
</p>
<p>which he predicted would not la*st much beyond fifty j'ears.
</p>
<p>But he would also have seen, what he did not foresee nor pre
</p>
<p>dict  the triumphant vindication of the Union.
</p>
<p>The embargo act was a favorite measure of Jefferson's ad
</p>
<p>ministration. It caused great distress in the country, and
</p>
<p>greatly weakened the Republican party. It was in the period
</p>
<p>of greatest distress that the Presidential election came on.
</p>
<p>Virginia was in the field with two candidates, Madison and
</p>
<p>Monroe. The Congressional caucus decided in Madison's favor
</p>
<p>by 80 majority. Clinton, who had been Vice President in
</p>
<p>Jefferson's last term, was chosen by the caucus for tho same
</p>
<p>position under Madison. It is needless to say this ticket was
</p>
<p>elected. The theory of States' Rights, which had been so
</p>
<p>much talked of before the Republicans got control of the Fed-
</p>
<p>.eral Government, was almost forgotten. They occupied the
</p>
<p>Federal forts, and there was no party left to man the States'

</p>
<p>that contemplated war against the authority of the Federal
</p>
<p>Government. State Rights was the prelude to raise the hue and cry
</p>
<p>against every measure adopted by the Government for de
</p>
<p>fence. First against the whisky tax, by Pennsylvania ; then
</p>
<p>against the Embargo Act and the war of 1812, by the Hartford
</p>
<p>Conventionists ; then against the tariff, by South Carolina ;
</p>
<p>then against the fugitive slave law, by many of the Northern
</p>
<p>States ; and then against freedom by the slave States com
</p>
<p>bined ; and finally it was given in great triumph by the assas
</p>
<p>sin, as justifying the murder of Mr. Lincoln  sic semper ty-
</p>
<p>rannis, the motto of the State of Virginia. He was a stickler
</p>
<p>for State Rights. By it he claimed the right, and, for slavery's
</p>
<p>sake, assassinated the President.
</p>
<p>Madison was not in favor of State Rights, as the extracts
</p>
<p>given from his letters, in another part of this book, abund
</p>
<p>antly prove. He was put forward as the strongest man Vir
</p>
<p>ginia had, as the politicians of that State had an understanding.
</p>
<p>There was no excitement about State Rights during his first
</p>
<p>election. Our foreign relations was the all-absorbing ques
</p>
<p>tion. The result of Jefferson's foreign policy was ruining the
</p>
<p>country. On the 1st of March, 1809, Congress passed the
</p>
<p>Non-Intercourse Act, and on the 15th of the same month re
</p>
<p>pealed the Embargo Act as to all nations except England and
</p>
<p>France, between whom and the United States no trade was
</p>
<p>permitted. The Massachusetts Legislature, in January, 1809, in a report
</p>
<p>on the state of the country at the end of Jefferson's adminis
</p>
<p>tration, says : "Our agriculture is discouraged ; the fisheries
</p>
<p>abandoned ; navigation forbidden ; our commerce at home re
</p>
<p>strained, if not annihilated ; our commerce abroad cut off ; our
</p>
<p>navy sold, dismantled, or degraded to the service of cutters or
</p>
<p>gun-boats ; the revenue extinguished ; the course of justice
</p>
<p>interrupted ; and the nation weakened by internal animosities
</p>
<p>and divisions, at the moment when it is unnecessarily and im-

</p>
<p>170 ORIGIN AND HISTORY OP THE
</p>
<p>The foregoing is a true picture of the condition of the coun
</p>
<p>try and the administration of the first State Rights President.
</p>
<p>Russell, in his researches of the Life of Jefferson, remarks :
</p>
<p>" Let us suppose that Mr. Jefferson had been chosen to carry
</p>
<p>into practice the first experiment of the Federal Government
</p>
<p>instead of Washington, and that he had applied his system of.
</p>
<p>State Rights and popular interference to the new machine
</p>
<p>which the Federal Convention had just placed in the hands
</p>
<p>of the Executive. Is it not self-evident that, for want of vigor
</p>
<p>and energy, the Constitution would have crumbled to pieces
</p>
<p>in his hands, and left him in possession only of the fragments
</p>
<p>of the .old Confederacy."
</p>
<p>Madison was a Federalist, and advocated the adoption of
</p>
<p>the Constitution ; and his great ability carried it through the
</p>
<p>Virginia Convention by 11 majority  for its adoption, 89 ;
</p>
<p>against it, 78.
</p>
<p>It soon became evident that our foreign relations were in a
</p>
<p>condition to demand immediate attention. Jefferson had re
</p>
<p>duced the army and navy, and almost left the nation power
</p>
<p>less for defence. The administration of Madison increased
</p>
<p>the army from 3,000 to 20,000 men, and Congress also passed'
</p>
<p>an act authorizing the President to receive the service of
</p>
<p>50,000 volunteers. Madison was not desirous of having a war
</p>
<p>during his administration, but was actually forced into it.
</p>
<p>He thought a declaration of war at a time when the Govern
</p>
<p>ment had been stripped of all its armor, was impolitic. Mr.
</p>
<p>Monroe was the only one of his Cabinet officers with a mili
</p>
<p>tary turn of mind.
</p>
<p>One John Henry, a native of Ireland, had been employed
</p>
<p>by Sir Jonas H. Craig, Governor of Canada, to visit Boston
</p>
<p>and arrange for a dissolution of the Union with some of the
</p>
<p>Federalists of New England. He could find no one that sym
</p>
<p>pathized with his mission, and returned to Canada in 1811.
</p>
<p>In February, 1812, he disclosed the secret to Madison, and re
</p>
<p>ceived a reward of $50,000.

<p>The declaration of war against Great Britain was approved
</p>
<p>by Mr. Madison, June 18th, 1812. Members of Congress. from
</p>
<p>AMERICAN UNION. 171
</p>
<p>the South and West carried the war measure against the will
</p>
<p>and consent of the Northern States. Of 79 members of the
</p>
<p>House who voted for war, 46 resided south, and 33 north of
</p>
<p>the Delaware. Of the 19 Senators who voted for war, 14
</p>
<p>resided south, and 5 north of the Delaware.
</p>
<p>On the 18th of May, 1812, Madison was renominated by the
</p>
<p>vote of 82 members of Congress. Money matters were now
</p>
<p>stringent, and all the banks had suspended except a few in
</p>
<p>New England. War was unpopular, and taxation was dreaded.
</p>
<p>The invasion of Canada commenced in 1812, and the last im
</p>
<p>portant action of the war was fought Jan. 8, 1815  Gen. Jack
</p>
<p>son's victory over the British Gen. Packenham, at New Or
</p>
<p>leans. This battle was fought after peace was signed at
</p>
<p>Ghent, December 24, 1814. Very little was accomplished by
</p>
<p>the war, except a marked respect since shown by the British
</p>
<p>Government to the rights of our seamen.
</p>
<p>The Hartford Convention assembled in Hartford, Connecti
</p>
<p>cut, Dec. 15, 1814, and sat twenty days. This Convention met
</p>
<p>to express the sentiments of the anti-war party of New Eng
</p>
<p>land. The following is part of the report made by them at
</p>
<p>the time : " In cases of deliberate, dangerous, and palpable
</p>
<p>impositions of the Constitution, affecting the sovereignty of a
</p>
<p>State and the liberties of the people, it is not only the right but
</p>
<p>tlie duty of each State to interpose its authority for their protec
</p>
<p>tion in the manner best calculated to secure that end.. When emer
</p>
<p>gencies occur which are either beyond the reach of judicial
</p>
<p>tribunals or too pressing to admit of delay incident to their
</p>
<p>forms, States which have no common umpire must be their own
</p>
<p>judges and execute their own decisions."
</p>
<p>The true cause of grievance against the administration was,
</p>
<p>that it had withheld all supplies for the maintenance of the
</p>
<p>militia for the year 1814, both in Massachusetts and Connecti
</p>
<p>cut, and thus forced upon these States the burden of support

</p>
<p>sion and their towns from being sacked. The number of del

<p>egates at this Convention was 26. The Legislatures of Mas
</p>
<p>sachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island sent delegates. In
</p>
<p>172 ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE
</p>
<p>Vermont and New Hampshire the delegates received their
</p>
<p>appointments from local conventions. No one of the members
</p>
<p>of this Convention would ever admit that a dissolution of the
</p>
<p>Union was contemplated, but contended that it was simply to
</p>
<p>bring about a remedy for burdens too grievous to be borne.
</p>
<p>That the entire section had much to endure during the war
</p>
<p>of 1812, no one acquainted with the history of those times
</p>
<p>will deny ; but they counseled resistance to Federal authority
</p>
<p>under the plea of State Rights. Although itwas not in the
</p>
<p>form of an article of dissolution or ordinance of secession, yet
</p>
<p>all must admit that it had the smell of treason.
</p>
<p>Under the names of Republican and Democrat this party
</p>
<p>stigmatized the Hartford Conventionists as traitors, and now
</p>
<p>come round and say they were right.
</p>
<p>Pollard, in his 1st volume, page 59, Southern History of the
</p>
<p>War, speaking of this Convention, says : " This is the doc
</p>
<p>trine which the South had always held from the beginning,
</p>
<p>and for which she is now pouring out her blood and treasure."
</p>
<p>By hitching the slave interest on to the State Rights heresy,
</p>
<p>they inaugurated war against the General Government. The
</p>
<p>Federal, afterwards the Whig, then the Republican, and lastly"
</p>
<p>the Union party, have ever kept in view the idea that "we,
</p>
<p>the people of the United States," made the Federal Govern
</p>
<p>ment, and are bound to sustain it against State Rights, slavery
</p>
<p>and rebellion.
</p>
<p>The loss of life resulting from the war of 1812 may be set
</p>
<p>down at about 30,000 men ; and the total expenditure of the
</p>
<p>United States during the contest was about $100,000,000. It
</p>
<p>lasted about three years. The Americans, on the ocean and
</p>
<p>lakes, had captured about 56 British ships of war, mounting.
</p>
<p>886 cannon, and 2,360 merchant vessels, mounting 8,000 guns,
</p>
<p>of which 345 were ships, 610 brigs, 520 schooners, 135 sloops,
</p>
<p>and 750 vessels of various classes taken by the Americans
</p>
<p>and retaken by the British ; making altogether 2,416 vessels,
</p>
<p>with their specie and cargoes, and about 30,000 prisoners of

</p>
<p>AMERICAN UNION. 173
</p>
<p>Near the latter end of the war, on the 24th of August, 1814,
</p>
<p>Washington City was captured by the British and the Capitol
</p>
<p>burned. This war was brewing during Jefferson's last term.
</p>
<p>It commenced during Madison's first, and was brought to an
</p>
<p>end towards the close of his second term.
</p>
<p>Mr. Monroe was nominated by the Virginia influence. The
</p>
<p>Congressional caucus was held March 16, 1816. Monroe got
</p>
<p>65 votes in the caucus, and Wm. H. Crawford, of Georgia, 54.
</p>
<p>Daniel D. Tompkins, of New York, got 85 votes for Vice
</p>
<p>President on the same ticket.
</p>
<p>Madison was Federal in his views as regards the power con
</p>
<p>ferred on the National Government. When the discussion
</p>
<p>arose about the power of the General Government to annul
</p>
<p>State laws wherein Congress deemed them improper, Madison
</p>
<p>remarked, "that he could not but regard an indefinite power
</p>
<p>to negative legislative acts of the States as absolutely neces
</p>
<p>sary' to a perfect system."  Analysis qf Constitution, page 134.
</p>
<p>Monroe was an Anti-Federalist, and opposed the adoption
</p>
<p>of the Federal Constitution, in 1787, in the Virginia Legisla
</p>
<p>ture, while Madison, Marshall, Randolph, and Pendleton, de
</p>
<p>fended and voted for it. Madison's administration terminated
</p>
<p>on the 3d of March, 1817, and Monroe was inaugurated the
</p>
<p>following day. About the first thing he did, after selecting
</p>
<p>his Cabinet officers, was to take a tour round the Atlantic
</p>
<p>coast to inspect the forts, and arrange for perfecting proper
</p>
<p>means of defence from invasion. The result of the war of
</p>
<p>1812 had fully established the importance of this movement.
</p>
<p>He left Washington the 31st of May, 1817, and was gone about
</p>
<p>three months.
</p>
<p>Although Mr. Monroe was understood to be a Republican,
</p>
<p>yet, strange to say, he called as his Cabinet officers men of
</p>
<p>the Federal stamp. John Q. Adams, Crawford, Crownin
</p>
<p>shield, and Wirt, were all of the same views as Alexander
</p>
<p>Hamilton in regard to the powers of the National Government.
</p>
<p>In his first term an act was passed, at the recommendation of

<p>the President, granting a pension to revolutionary soldiers, of
</p>
<p>whom about 13,000 were yet living; also an act respecting
</p>
<p>174 ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE
</p>
<p>the flag of the United States, fixing the number of stripes,
</p>
<p>alternate red and white, at thirteen, and directed that the
</p>
<p>Union be represented by stars equal to the number of
</p>
<p>States, white in a blue field. The Florida war commenced in
</p>
<p>his first term, and was only brought to a close August 14,
</p>
<p>1843. It originated on account of a desire on the part of the
</p>
<p>slaveholders to drive out the Seminole Indians, who, they de
</p>
<p>clared, were harboring runaway slaves, and means were re
</p>
<p>sorted to and excuses framed to bring about a collision.
</p>
<p>Everything appeared to work well with his administration
</p>
<p>until Feb. 28, 1820, when Missouri asked admission into the
</p>
<p>Union with its peculiar slave Constitution. This question was
</p>
<p>continued until the 28th of February, 1821, and the act ad
</p>
<p>mitting it was passed and signed by Monroe on the 2d of
</p>
<p>March, same year. The workings of the Federal Government
</p>
<p>up to this time had embraced almost all political questions.
</p>
<p>But when the slavery question began to agitate Congress, the
</p>
<p>doctrine of State Rights was now claimed to be of prominent
</p>
<p>importance. It was evident to every statesman that when
</p>
<p>these two questions became linked together, presenting an
</p>
<p>undivided front, they would destroy the peace of the country.
</p>
<p>Having been renominated by the caucus, Monroe was re
</p>
<p>elected, in 1820, almost unanimously. He was a half-and-half
</p>
<p>party man ; he opposed in a great measure the policy marked
</p>
<p>out by Jefferson, and could not, after his election, be claimed
</p>
<p>as the embodiment of Republican ideas. The power is granted
</p>
<p>to Congress by the Constitution " to make all laws which shall
</p>
<p>be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the fore
</p>
<p>going powers." This clause has been a source of contention
</p>
<p>ever since the formation of the Government. Monroe, in his
</p>
<p>Internal Improvement message, May 4, 1822, treats the sub
</p>
<p>ject at great length, and aims at the conclusion that the object
</p>
<p>of granting these powers was to leave nothing to implication.
</p>
<p>He also held that these powers were inherent in the very na
</p>
<p>ture of the compact, and would have existed substantially if

<p>the grant had not been made. Most of his Cabinet officers j
</p>
<p>were Federal, and when he became President, although previ-
</p>
<p>AMERICAN UNION. 175
</p>
<p>ously a strong Republican, he inclined so much towards the
</p>
<p>Federalists' views of the Constitution that his old political
</p>
<p>associates called him a no-party man.
</p>
<p>In his seventh annual message, Dec. 2, 1823, he remarks :
</p>
<p>" But, in regard to these continents, circumstances are eminent
</p>
<p>ly and conspicuously different. It is impossible that the Allied
</p>
<p>Powers should extend their political system to any portion qf
</p>
<p>either continent without endangering our peace and happiness."
</p>
<p>This idea was first promulgated by him, and has since been
</p>
<p>known as the Monroe Doctrine.
</p>
<p>The efforts of Aaron Burr's friends to secure for him the
</p>
<p>office of President, when they well knew that the people had
</p>
<p>chosen Jefferson for that exalted position, put a quietus on
</p>
<p>electing the Vice President as the successor. Before that,
</p>
<p>Adams, the Vice President under Washington, was chosen to
</p>
<p>succeed him, and Jefferson, Vice President under Adams, fol
</p>
<p>lowed. The Vice Presidency, up to this time, was looked upon
</p>
<p>as a kind of school to fit a man for the higher station of Chief
</p>
<p>Magistrate. But the excitement attending the election of
</p>
<p>1800 prevented the election of any Vies President to the
</p>
<p>Presidency for the period of 36 years, when Martin Van Bu
</p>
<p>ren, who had been Vice President under Jackson, was chosen
</p>
<p>to succeed him. John Tyler and Millard Fillmore became
</p>
<p>Presidents after the assassinations of Harrison and Taylor ;
</p>
<p>and our present Chief Magistrate, Andrew Johnson, holds his
</p>
<p>position in consequence of the assassination of President
</p>
<p>. Lincoln. The election of 1825 going to the House produced a reaction
</p>
<p>in favor of Jackson, who entirely broke up the Congressional
</p>
<p>caucus system of nominating Presidential candidates. He was
</p>
<p>placed in the field early by his own State in 1829. This com
</p>
<p>pletely destroyed the caucus system. He was again nominated
</p>
<p>by the Legislatures of Pennsylvania and New York, and was
</p>
<p>re-elected. Tlie Convention system was first introduced at Baltimore, in

</p>
<p>Masonry. He suddenly disappeared, and. his supposed death
</p>
<p>was charged against the Masonic Order, but no evidence has
</p>
<p>ever been adduced to establish the truth of the charge. Even
</p>
<p>if the Lodge of which he was a member had made way with
</p>
<p>him (of which there is no evidence) it could not be charged
</p>
<p>on the Order.
</p>
<p>Mr. Clay was then the opponent of Jackson. The Conven
</p>
<p>tion would have liked to have had him as their candidate, but
</p>
<p>Clay being a Mason, his nomination was out of the question.
</p>
<p>After adopting a platform, the Convention nominated Wm.
</p>
<p>Wirt, of Maryland, as a candidate for President, and Amos
</p>
<p>Ellmaker, of Pennsylvania, as Vice President. At this Presi
</p>
<p>dential election, the party names underwent a change. Re
</p>
<p>publicans changed to Democrat and Federalists to Whig.
</p>
<p>The party that had nominated Wirt called - themselves the
</p>
<p>National Republican party, and carried the State of Vermont.
</p>
<p>The Whigs met in December, of the same year, (1831,) at the
</p>
<p>same place, and nominated Clay for President, and John Ser
</p>
<p>geant, of Pennsylvania, for VicePresident. These two parties,
</p>
<p>with their candidates, led the opposition, and the most they
</p>
<p>expected was again to throw the election into the House.
</p>
<p>The State of New Hampshire sent out a call for a National
</p>
<p>Convention to nominate a candidate for Vice President. Cal
</p>
<p>houn had a quarrel'with Jackson, and the Democracy assem
</p>
<p>bled in force May 21, 1832, in Baltimore. Martin Van Buren
</p>
<p>was chosen by 203 out of 283 members present.
</p>
<p>The Convention system has been kept up by both parties
</p>
<p>ever since, the Democratic party adopting the two-thirds rule
</p>
<p>in nominating, which has been the means of slaughtering
</p>
<p>nearly all its best statesmen for twenty years. The Native
</p>
<p>American and Abolition parties also both resorted to the Con
</p>
<p>vention system to bring their candidates into the field. The

<p>slavery controversy having now become the all-absorbing ques

<p>HISTOE Y
</p>
<p>OF
</p>
<p>GREAT CIVIL WARS.
</p>
<p>HOW THEY ENDED.
</p>
<p>The Peloponnesian war which began four hundred and
</p>
<p>thirty-two years B. C, lasted twenty-seven years. This
</p>
<p>war was brought on by the rivalry of the Grecian states 
</p>
<p>state sovereignty or autonomy. Pericles wanted union, but
</p>
<p>his efforts to form a great nation from rival sovereignties
</p>
<p>proved a failure.
</p>
<p>Sparta and Athens held slaves. The latter over 400,000, to
</p>
<p>60,000 persons. The former Sparta was the South Carolina
</p>
<p>of Greece during the progress of the war; she, fearing insur
</p>
<p>rection among the slaves, offered liberty to all that would join
</p>
<p>the army. 2,000 came up to accept the boon, and the oli
</p>
<p>garchs had them secretly led away and massacred. By.
</p>
<p>this fiendish treachery they were enabled to get rid of an ele
</p>
<p>ment that might produce discord at home.
</p>
<p>It is curious to contrast the numbers engaged in our war
</p>
<p>with those engaged in the great wars of the past :
</p>
<p>" We select two decisive battles. One of these was fought
</p>
<p>in the harbor of Syracuse. In an expedition against Sicily,
</p>
<p>Athens had strained every nerve and equipped a magnificent
</p>
<p>fleet and army. They sailed out of the Piraeus with sound of
</p>
<p>trumpets, pasans, and libations of wine from gold and silver
</p>
<p>cups. This great army consisted of five thousand heavy
</p>
<p>armed infantry. It was reinforced by another of about the
</p>
<p>same number. When gathered at Syracuse they numbered
</p>
<p>in all  heavy armed infantry, natives of the island, and slaves

</p>
<p>twent}' thousand men. This, in the language of Thucydides,
</p>
<p>made her power appear' stupendous,' and her resources ' be
</p>
<p>yond calculation.'
</p>
<p>" The final and decisive battle was that of Aigospotami,
</p>
<p>when Athens lost her fleet, and nearly her whole army was
</p>
<p>surprised and taken prisoners. The numbers engaged in bit-
</p>
<p>tie are, not told ; but the number of prisoners, who were native
</p>
<p>Athenians, is recorded as three thousand, which seems to have
</p>
<p>made up the bulk of her army in the last decisive engage
</p>
<p>ment." NOW AND THEN.
</p>
<p>As to the numbers engaged, the little state of Massachusetts
</p>
<p>has furnished more men in our present struggle than fought
</p>
<p>on both sides in the great English rebellion. It has sent more
</p>
<p>men into the field than Julius Csesar commanded to gain the
</p>
<p>empire of the world ; more than all the troops of Hellas put
</p>
<p>together in the long struggle that rent her in pieces, when
</p>
<p>her sun went down in blood. The state of New York has
</p>
<p>equipped more soldiers than all the troops of Cassar and Pom
</p>
<p>pey put together, though drawn from every province, from the
</p>
<p>Euphrates to the pillars of Hercules. The whole army of
</p>
<p>Cromwell would only serve as skirmishers, or as a detail for a
</p>
<p>" raid" from the army of Grant or Sherman. His great military
</p>
<p>fame was gained by managing twenty-five thousand men ; and
</p>
<p>its marches and evolutions were within an area less extensive
</p>
<p>than the state of Virginia." THE ENGLISH REBELLION.
</p>
<p>"The great civil war of England, known as ' the Great Re
</p>
<p>bellion,' was also a conflict between the oligarchs and the com
</p>
<p>mons ; called the Cavaliers and the Roundheads ; more appro
</p>
<p>priately, the King and his Parliament. It divided England
</p>
<p>horizontally the king and the lords and the bishops on one
</p>
<p>ride, the commons on the other ; and it decided the question
</p>
<p>forever, whether constitutional government was a possible
</p>
<p>boon to the English race.

<p>" The war opened in 1642, and continued seven years. It
</p>
<p>HISTORY OF GREAT CIVIL WARS. 183
</p>
<p>would probably have been finished in half that time, but for
</p>
<p>the hesitancy and half measures of Essex, the first parlia
</p>
<p>mentary general. The first conflict of Edgehill has its exact
</p>
<p>parallel in Antietam. Itwas a drawn battle: both parties
</p>
<p>laying all night on their arms ; but, in the morning, Hampden
</p>
<p>came up with four thousand fresh men. Julius Caesar would
</p>
<p>have followed up quickly the former day's work, and, with
</p>
<p>blow upon blow, finished the royalists and the war. Instead
</p>
<p>of this, the armies ' looked at each other,' dreaded to renew
</p>
<p>the fight, and drew off, each by itself, much to the chagrin
</p>
<p>and disgust of Hampden. Five thousand were left slain upon
</p>
<p>the field  slain to no purpose, as nothing was decided. So
</p>
<p>things went on, till Oliver Cromwell came with his ' ironside
</p>
<p>regiment,' and, at the decisive battle of Naseby, dashed upon
</p>
<p>the king's forces, and shivered them in pieces.
</p>
<p>" We may smile, on reading over these great battles, at the
</p>
<p>numbers engaged. They varied from twenty to twenty-five
</p>
<p>thousand men on each side, never exceeding the latter num
</p>
<p>ber. The battle of Marston Moor was the most obstinately
</p>
<p>contested, between ' the most numerous armies that were
</p>
<p>engaged during the course of these wars ;' and in that battle,
</p>
<p>as Hume laments, fifty thousand British troops were led to
</p>
<p>mutual slaughter. Such was the price paid ; the end achieved
</p>
<p>was free government for the English race everywhere."
</p>
<p>Wars unskillfully waged are the bloodiest of all. Cassar,
</p>
<p>in a three years' war between the Cassareans and Pompeians,
</p>
<p>lost fewer men than McClellan did in a single campaign on
</p>
<p>the Peninsula. Indeed, it is said, more lives have been lost in
</p>
<p>our present war than the great civil wars of Greece, Rome
</p>
<p>and England put together ; and this might have been avoided
</p>
<p>had the North been a military people.
</p>
<p>THE EFFECT OF INTERVENTION.
</p>
<p>" It is well to look into the gulf of ruin from which our
</p>
<p>present civil war has saved us. Resolving the Union into
</p>
<p>thirty-six state sovereignties would place us exactly where the

<p>Greek Autonomies were placed in their struggle of twenty-

</p>
<p>seven years. It means mutual slaughter and final collapse,
</p>
<p>until some stronger third power comes in and adjusts the
</p>
<p>bleeding fragments. Persia finally 'intervened' in favor of
</p>
<p>Sparta : and her hateful despotism was pressed down upon all
</p>
<p>the States of Hellas and her lovely islands. Thebes finally
</p>
<p>rebelled against it, led on by the great EpamiDondas ; and a
</p>
<p>second series of civil wars brought on a more complete ex
</p>
<p>haustion, and a more deadly collapse. Philip of Macedon next
</p>
<p>' intervened,' and crushed them still lower into the dust, amid the
</p>
<p>dying thunders of Demosthenes, and the fading glories of the
</p>
<p>Grecian name. Next Rome ' intervened' and conquered Mace
</p>
<p>donia ; and both Macedonia and Hellas went down together
</p>
<p>under her iron heel. Next the Turk ' intervened ;' and Rome,
</p>
<p>in all her Eastern empire, involving Greece with her ancient
</p>
<p>states and beautiful isles, was eclipsed in a more baleful despo
</p>
<p>tism and in heathen night. Such are the last results of auto
</p>
<p>nomy  dismemberment, mutual hate and slaughter, national
</p>
<p>extinction and death. So the lovliest form of ancient civiliza
</p>
<p>tion, in a democracy just rising to the glories of empire, was
</p>
<p>sacrificed to the insane notion of petty ' state sovereignty ;'
</p>
<p>and when we now ask, Where is Hellas ? we are only answered
</p>
<p>by poets, who sing her elegy :
</p>
<p>"Ask the Paynim slave,
</p>
<p>Who treads all tearless on her hallowed graves ;
</p>
<p>Invoke tho spirits of the past, and shed
</p>
<p>The voice of your strong bidding on the dead !
</p>
<p>Lo, from a thousand crumbling tombs they rise
</p>
<p>The great of old, the powerful and the wise !

</p>
<p>DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS TO BRING ABOUT PEACE BEFORE AND DURING
</p>
<p>THE FIGHT.  MR. LINCOLN AT RICHMOND.
</p>
<p>Ever since war was determined on by the South efforts
</p>
<p>have been made by individuals on both sides to bring about
</p>
<p>peace by diplomacy. Before Buchanan's administration ex
</p>
<p>pired South Carolina sent delegates to Washington to arrange
</p>
<p>for a peaceable dissolution pf the Union. On the 5th of
</p>
<p>March, 1861, John Forsythe, Martin J. Crawford, and A. B.
</p>
<p>Roman, were sent by the Confederate authorities. They
</p>
<p>proposed a peaceable dissolution of the Union, and a division
</p>
<p>of its effects. Then came, in after times, Sanders, Thompson,
</p>
<p>Tucker and Clay, of Canada plotting assassination fame.
</p>
<p>From the North, by permission, went Col. Jaques, and his
</p>
<p>colleague, and had a talk with the rebel chiefs in Richmond.
</p>
<p>Then Horace Greeley met Clay, Thompson, and Sanders, at
</p>
<p>Niagara Falls. The above seekers were unable to find peace,
</p>
<p>but Mr. Greeley thought it not so difficult to attain as was
</p>
<p>generally thought. In January, 1865, Francis P. Blair, of
</p>
<p>Washington, and Gen. Singleton, of Illinois, by permission,
</p>
<p>made a visit to Richmond, and induced Jeff Davis to renew
</p>
<p>his efforts for peace through diplomacy. Vice President A.
</p>
<p>H. Stephens, Judge Campbell, and R. M. T. Hunter, were
</p>
<p>chosen by him, and sent to confer with President Lincoln.
</p>
<p>The meeting was arranged, and took place on board the Uni
</p>
<p>ted States transport River Queen, in Hampton Roads, Va.,
</p>
<p>February 3, 1865. The rebel- Commissioners demanded an
</p>
<p>armistice, as a preliminary measure. This President Lincoln
</p>
<p>refused to grant.
</p>
<p>Secretary Seward, who was at the conference with Presi
</p>
<p>dent Lincoln, in a letter to Mr. Adams, our British Minister,
</p>
<p>dated Feb. 9, 1865, remarks : " The Richmond party were
</p>
<p>then informed that Congress had, on the 21st ult., adopted by
</p>
<p>a constitutional majority a joint resolution submitting to the
</p>
<p>several States the proposition to abolish slavery throughout
</p>
<p>the Union, and that there is every reason to believe that it

</p>
<p>will be accepted by three-fourths of the States, so as to be-

<p>186 PEACE BY DIPLOMACY.
</p>
<p>come a part of the national organic law. The conference came
</p>
<p>to an end by mutual acquiescence, without producing an agree
</p>
<p>ment of views upon the several matters discussed, or any of
</p>
<p>them. Nevertheless, it is perhaps of some importance that
</p>
<p>we have been able to submit our opinions and views directly
</p>
<p>to prominent insurgents, and to hear them in answer in a cour
</p>
<p>teous and not unfriendly manner.
</p>
<p>* The following is1 the rebel version, as given by A. H. Ste
</p>
<p>phens :
</p>
<p>Davis sent for his Vice President, and informed him of.tiie
</p>
<p>purport of Blair's mission. Stephens advised that Davis him
</p>
<p>self should go to meet President Lincoln, and Generals Grant
</p>
<p>and Lee should be the only persons even to know of the meet
</p>
<p>ing or be present at the interview. Davis refused to adopt
</p>
<p>this plan, and appointed three Commissioners to go in his
</p>
<p>place. He instructed them not to enter into any agreement
</p>
<p>whatever without his rank as President was first recognized.
</p>
<p>During the conference, while this point was being discussed,
</p>
<p>Hunter received a settler from Mr. Lincoln.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hunter made a long reply, insisting that the recogni
</p>
<p>tion of Davis's power to make a treaty was the first and in
</p>
<p>dispensable step to peace, and referring to the correspondence
</p>
<p>between King Charles the First aud his Parliament, as a relia
</p>
<p>ble precedent of a constitutional ruler treating with rebels.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln's face then wore that indescribable expression
</p>
<p>which generally preceded his hardest hits, and he remarked .
</p>
<p>4 Upon questions of history I must refer you to Mr. Seward,
</p>
<p>for he is posted in such things, and I don't propose to be
</p>
<p>bright. My only distinct recollection of the matter is, that,'
</p>
<p>Charles lost his head." That settled Mr. Hunter for a while.
</p>
<p>After this Mr.. Lincoln's manner became earnest, and he
</p>
<p>gave the Commissioners to understand that nothing short of
</p>
<p>unconditional restoration of the Union could for a moment be
</p>
<p>entertained, and said the time might come when they (the
</p>
<p>rebels) would not be considered as an erring people invited

<p>PEACE BY DIPLOMACY. 187
</p>
<p>A. H. Stephens (so says the Augusta Chronicle, June 7,
</p>
<p>1865) states that President Lincoln, at the conference, offered
</p>
<p>to pay to the South, for the loss of her slaves, $400,000,000 in
</p>
<p>gold. He says this offer was suppressed in making the report,
</p>
<p>but was reported to Davis confidentially, as the Commission
</p>
<p>ers believed it would damage Mr. Lincoln, and perhaps prevent
</p>
<p>him in future from renewing the same liberal offer.
</p>
<p>Judge Campbell, in his report, says he was satisfied with
</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln's ultimatum, and was ready to acquiesce. Several
</p>
<p>day^ after their return to Richmond, he says Hunter became
</p>
<p>convinced of the hopelessness of looking or fighting for any
</p>
<p>thing better, and sided with him. Stephens at first thought a
</p>
<p>longer delay might result more favorable to the South, but
</p>
<p>on the eve of his departure for Georgia (which took place the
</p>
<p>day before the meeting at the African Church) he also acqui
</p>
<p>esced with the other Commissioners.
</p>
<p>After the capture of Richmond Judge Campbell remained
</p>
<p>in the place, and expressed a desire to Generals Weitzel and
</p>
<p>Shepley to see President Lincoln, whom he had learned was
</p>
<p>coming to the city. When Mr. Lincoln arrived the Generals
</p>
<p>communicated this to him, and he immediately sent for Camp
</p>
<p>bell, who met him at Weitzel's headquarters in the old Jeff.
</p>
<p>Davis mansion. Campbell expressed a great desire for peace,
</p>
<p>and insisted that Virginia should be taken back into the Un-
</p>
<p>ion, which would serve as a stepping stone for the other
</p>
<p>Southern States. He argued that if the Virginia Legislature
</p>
<p>was called together they would vote the State back at once.
</p>
<p>He submitted many plans to Mr. Lincoln  among others, that
</p>
<p>Of assembling the leading men of Virginia at Richmond. Mr.
</p>
<p>Lincoln then stated to Campbell that it had been his inten
</p>
<p>tion to return back to City Point immediately, but at his re
</p>
<p>quest he would stay until the next day. In the meantime
</p>
<p>Campbell went in search of some leading men, but could only
</p>
<p>succeed in finding a Mr. Gustavus A. Meyers, a former mer
</p>
<p>chant of the city. The next day the interview was held in

<p>the cabin of the Malvern, on board of which the President
</p>
<p>had retained his quarters.
</p>
<p>188 PEACE BY DIPLOMACY.
</p>
<p>The New York Herald, of July 9, 1865, gives tbe following
</p>
<p>account of the proceedings, upon the arrival of Campbell and
</p>
<p>Meyers, in the presence of Gen. Weitzel :
</p>
<p>" After the ordinary greetings, Mr. Lincoln drew from the
</p>
<p>breast-pocket of his coat a folded document in his own hand
</p>
<p>writing, covering parts of two pages of foolscap paper, with
</p>
<p>out date or signature. He said that that paper contained his
</p>
<p>finality to the South. If the South desired peace, they could
</p>
<p>have it on the terms therein set forth, but on no other. He
</p>
<p>then proceeded to read the document, of which the following
</p>
<p>is an abstract :
</p>
<p>Three things are essential to peace :
</p>
<p>First. The restoration of the national authority throughout
</p>
<p>all the States.
</p>
<p>Second. No receding by the Executive of the United States
</p>
<p>on the slavery question from the position assumed thereon in
</p>
<p>the late annual message to Congress and in preceding docu
</p>
<p>ments. Third. No cessation of hostilities short of an end of the
</p>
<p>war and the disbanding of all forces hostile to the Govern
</p>
<p>ment All propositions coming from those in hostility to the Gov
</p>
<p>ernment, and not inconsistent with the foregoing, will be re
</p>
<p>spectfully considered and passed upon in a spirit of sincere
</p>
<p>liberality. Beyond the indispensable terms any reasonable
</p>
<p>conditions will be entertained.
</p>
<p>The remission of confiscations was left within the- power of
</p>
<p>the Executive. Confiscations will be enforced if tho war is
</p>
<p>continued, but will be remitted to the people of any State
</p>
<p>which shall now promptly and in good faith withdraw its
</p>
<p>troops and other support from further resistance to the Gov
</p>
<p>ernment. This has no reference to rights of property in slaves.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln then re-read the paper, commenting at length
</p>
<p>on each paragraph and sentence, in order to make his meaning
</p>
<p>clear and distinct. The paper was then handed to the South

</p>
<p>THE VIRGINIA LEGISLATURE. 189
</p>
<p>THE QUESTION OF PARDONS.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln remarked that the question of pardons was not
</p>
<p>mentioned in the paper. The pardoning power, he said, was
</p>
<p>vested wholly and unreservedly with himself. He could not
</p>
<p>force pardons upon anybody. Jeff. Davis had said that he
</p>
<p>would not accept a pardon from him (Mr. Lincoln). What was
</p>
<p>not worth asking for was not worth receiving. " But most any
</p>
<p>body can have most anything they choose to ask for."
</p>
<p>mr. Lincoln's plan for reassembling the Virginia
</p>
<p>legislature.
</p>
<p>After some general conversation, Mr. Lincoln, doubtless re
</p>
<p>ferring to the proposition of the previous evening, said :
</p>
<p>"I have been considering apian for reassembling the Vir
</p>
<p>ginia Legislature. I deem it of the greatest importance that the
</p>
<p>same organization which has been casting the influence and
</p>
<p>support of the State to the rebels should bring the State back
</p>
<p>into the Union. If I can work it out in my mind I will let you
</p>
<p>know."
</p>
<p>In justice to General Weitzel, whom'the public has charged
</p>
<p>with transcending his authority in permittiug the call for the
</p>
<p>assembling of the Virginia Legislature to be made, this point
</p>
<p>is important. The proposition that had been made to Mr.
</p>
<p>Lincoln was to convene the public and leading statesmen of
</p>
<p>Virginia^ without reference to their official station, and to settle
</p>
<p>with them the terms and mode of reorganization, and to obtain
</p>
<p>their aid in composing and tranquilizing the people. On the
</p>
<p>following day the President addressed a note to General Weit
</p>
<p>zel from City Point authorizing him to permit the convening
</p>
<p>of the Legislature, and directing that the note be shown to
</p>
<p>Judge Campbell. On that authority the call for the recon
</p>
<p>vening of the Legislature was prepared and submitted to Gen
</p>
<p>eral Shepley for approval. General Shepley made some alter

</p>
<p>ations in its wording and then permitted it to be printed.
</p>
<p>190 THE VIRGINIA LEGISLATURE.
</p>
<p>THE REVOCATION OF THE ORDER.
</p>
<p>In the meantime the late President returned to Washington,
</p>
<p>where, it would seem, the action had was made the topic of
</p>
<p>discussion in the Cabinet, by the advice of which body, and
</p>
<p>because of revelations hereinafter detailed, the President was
</p>
<p>led to revoke the action. He thereupon addressed a note to
</p>
<p>General Weitzel directing that the permission for the reasem-
</p>
<p>bling of the Virginia Legislature be revoked and all the papers
</p>
<p>that had passed in the premises be withdrawn. This note en
</p>
<p>tered somewhat at length into the reasons .that induced the
</p>
<p>Executive to adopt this course. Simultaneously with the re
</p>
<p>ception of this note by General Weitzel, Major General. E- 0.
</p>
<p>C. Ord, Commander of the Department of Virginia, arrived at
</p>
<p>Richmond, having previously been absent with one of his corps,
</p>
<p>co-operating with the Army of the Potomac in pursuit of Lee.
</p>
<p>His arrival here operated to relieve General Weitzel of the,
</p>
<p>supreme command he had then been exercising, and the latter
</p>
<p>was sent to Petersburg with his corps. Because of the coin
</p>
<p>cidence of these events it was generally stated in the Northern
</p>
<p>papers that General Weitzel was relieved because of having
</p>
<p>transcended his authority, in permitting the call to issue for
</p>
<p>the assembling of tne Legislature. From the above it will be
</p>
<p>seen how unjust was this imputation. It is unfortunate that.
</p>
<p>considerations of national policy forbid the publication in full,
</p>
<p>of the late President's final note to General. Weitzel on this,
</p>
<p>subject, which fully exonerates that officer from all blame or
</p>
<p>censure in the matter.
</p>
<p>It is however most probable, as stated on eminent authority,
</p>
<p>that Mr. Lincoln, in the honesty of his intentions and the frank
</p>
<p>ness of, his heart, permitted himself to be entrapped where he
</p>
<p>considered everything to be fairandhonorable. It will.be rem
</p>
<p>embered that the proposition had been made to him to assemble.
</p>
<p>" the public and leading statesmen of Virginia, without; refer
</p>
<p>ence to their official station." This proposition, was intended
</p>
<p>and understood to mean the assembling qfthe people compos-,

</p>
<p>ing the State Legislature, though not as an official body. Mr.
</p>
<p>THE VIRGINIA LEGISLATURE. 191
</p>
<p>Lincoln, in referring to it, spoke of the " Virginia Legislature,''
</p>
<p>doubtless meaning thereby the unofficial body that had been
</p>
<p>spoken of to him ; and when he sanctioned the reassembling of
</p>
<p>that body, he did not intend that the old rebel Legislature
</p>
<p>should be called together as a recognized political orginaization,
</p>
<p>which wasattempted under the sanction gathered from his note.
</p>
<p>When he saw the literal interpretation that had been put upon
</p>
<p>his language by Campbell and others, he made haste to revoke
</p>
<p>the whole proceedings and recall all papers that had passed.
</p>
<p>It will be readily apprehended how deep was the plot thus
</p>
<p>working against the late President. Had " Extra" Billy Smith
</p>
<p>and his Legislature been permitted to come back and exer
</p>
<p>cise their functions as executive and legislative authorities of
</p>
<p>the State, it would have amounted to a recognition of those
</p>
<p>authorities, by which recognition would also have been impli
</p>
<p>ed not only the disavowal and repudiation of Governor Pier-
</p>
<p>point and his government, hut also the government of West
</p>
<p>Virginia, and, indeed, the whole State organization of West Vir
</p>
<p>ginia ; for the old Richmond Virginia State government has
</p>
<p>never recognized the division of tbe State, and was composed
</p>
<p>of delegates from the counties now included in the State of
</p>
<p>West Virginia, as well as the other counties of Virginia proper.
</p>
<p>If Mr. Lincoln's ideas may be deduced from the arguments
</p>
<p>that had been presented tc him, and upon which his action
</p>
<p>was based, his design was to permit Extra Billy Smith's Legis.
</p>
<p>latere to assemble in Richmond as a body of citizens, which,
</p>
<p>being looked upon in the South as the ligitimate government of
</p>
<p>the State, would have influence with the citizens of the State
</p>
<p>who were absent, and probably exert some influence over the
</p>
<p>other States. It was distinctly understood that if permitted
</p>
<p>to assemble this body would pass a bill declaring null and void
</p>
<p>all acts previously passed in hostility to the United States,
</p>
<p>and also recalling all troops of the State absent with the South
</p>
<p>ern armies. Under the popular Southern theory of State rights
</p>
<p>such action would have compelled respect and obedience, and

</p>
<p>would at least have withdrawn the State from the insurrection.
</p>
<p>It was also understood that immediately on taking this action
</p>
<p>192 THE VIRGINIA LEGISLATURE.
</p>
<p>the Legislature would dissolve, its members resign, and the
</p>
<p>whole government give way to such other legal organization
</p>
<p>as might be substituted. It will be remembered that all this
</p>
<p>occured previous to Lee's surrender, and when it was of great
</p>
<p>importance that the Virginia troops should be withdrawn from
</p>
<p>the rebel armies. Undoubtedly the desire to thus seriously
</p>
<p>weaken the rebel cause had great weight in determining the
</p>
<p>course pursued by Mr. Lincoln, while the seeming sincerity and
</p>
<p>honesty of the advocates of the course wholly shut from his
</p>
<p>view the tricky scheme involved.
</p>
<p>But the first step of the intriguers in misconstruing the mean
</p>
<p>ing of the President and presuming upon a sanction to call to
</p>
<p>gether the Legislature of the State defeated all their projects.
</p>
<p>While an honest man is inclined to believe everybody else
</p>
<p>honest, a single deviation from integrity will arouse his fullest
</p>
<p>indignation and operate to forever destroy all confidence. So
</p>
<p>in this instance, Mr. Lincoln, when he saw the trick, quickly
</p>
<p>applied the remedy, by revoking the sanction given and with
</p>
<p>drawing every scrap of writing that had passed. He could
</p>
<p>have no further conferences with such men.
</p>
<p>Such was the final effort of the lamented President to restore
</p>
<p>peace to the country. Fortunately the valor of our noble
</p>
<p>troops rendered other efforts unnecessary, and the war was
</p>
<p>terminated, not by negotiation or compromise, but by the stern

<p>decision of that arbitrament  the sword  to which the South

</p>
<p>AND HIS
</p>
<p>GREAT OAiMPAiaiSrS,
</p>
<p>INCLUDING HIS HOLIDAY MARCHES . THROUGH GEORGIA
</p>
<p>AND THE CAROLINAS.
</p>
<p>Wm. Tecumseh Sherman is of English descent ; his ancestors, Puritans,
</p>
<p>left Dedham, England, in 1634. Arriving in America, the family settled
</p>
<p>in Connecticut. Roger Sherman, one of the signers of the Declaration of
</p>
<p>Independence, who died in 1783, was of that family. Taylor Sherman,
</p>
<p>for many years judge ia Connecticut, died iu 1815-, leaving a widow and
</p>
<p>three children, Charles R., Daniel, and Betsy. Charles R. married Mary
</p>
<p>Hoyt in 1810, and settled at Lancaster, now the county seat of Fairfield
</p>
<p>county, Ohio. Here he commenced the practice of law, and was finally
</p>
<p>elected Judge of the Superior Court in 1823. After serving in that capa
</p>
<p>city for near six years, he was suddenly attacked with cholera while on
</p>
<p>the bench in the discharge of his ofiicial duties. He died in June, 1829,
</p>
<p>leaving a widow with eleven children.
</p>
<p>Wm. Tecumseh was born February 8th, 1820, and was named by his
</p>
<p>father, Tecumseh, in honor of the Indian chief of that name, who was
</p>
<p>killed, October 5th, 1813, at the battle of the Thames. At the age of
</p>
<p>nine years his mother gave him in charge of Thomas Ewing, a lawyer re
</p>
<p>siding in Lancaster. Mr. Ewing was for many years a Whig politician
</p>
<p>of the Henry Clay school. After the Presidential election of 1840, he was
</p>
<p>chosen by Harrison, March 5th, 1841, Secretary of the Treasury. When
</p>
<p>young Sherman was about 16 years of age, Mr. Ewing having at his dis
</p>
<p>posal the appointment of a military cadet for West Point, seeing the boy
</p>
<p>was developing talent for that kind of life, conferred it upon him. He,
</p>
<p>graduated fifth in his class at that institution in June 1840, and was cre
</p>

</p>
<p>that region until August 14th, 1843, 'yet he was . made 1st Lieu
</p>
<p>tenant in November, 1841, and sent to Fort Moultrie on Sullivan's
</p>
<p>Island in Charleston Harbor. After remaining there some time he was
</p>
<p>sent to California in 1846 as a Frontier Guard, and continued there until the
</p>
<p>close of the Mexican war ; here he was promoted to a Captaincy. He now
</p>
<p>became Captain Sherman, and in 1850, after his return from California,
</p>
<p>married Miss Ellen B. Ewing, daughter of his benefactor. He was after
</p>
<p>this connected with the Commissary Department of the Army, but in 1853
</p>
<p>he resigned his commission, and retired to private life. ,
</p>
<p>Mr. Lucas, of St. Louis, Mo. was now about to establish a banking-
</p>
<p>house in San Francisco under the name of Lucas, Turner & Co. He gave
</p>
<p>the management of this house to Captain Sherman, in the capacity of bank
</p>
<p>er, miner, and lawyer. He made and lost a large fortune in California.
</p>
<p>He returned from the Pacific coast and purchased a 160 acre farm near
</p>
<p>Topeka, Kansas, in 1857. While there he went into partnership with
</p>
<p>Hugh Ewing, Thomas Ewing, jr., and Daniel McCook, his two brother-
</p>
<p>in-laws, and McCook. Their law office was at Leavenworth, and the
</p>
<p>style of the firm was Ewing, Sherman & McCook. Having little taste for
</p>
<p>the legal profession, he was in 1860 offered, and accepted, at a yearly sal
</p>
<p>ary of $5000 the Presidency of the Military School of Louisiana, situated
</p>
<p>at Alexandria, a town on. Red River, about 350 miles above New Orleans.
</p>
<p>When he ascertained Louisiana was preparing to secede from the Union
</p>
<p>to join the rebellion, he sent the following patriotic letter to its governor :
</p>
<p>January 18th, 1861.
</p>
<p>Gov. Thomas 0. Mooke, Baton Rouge, La :
</p>
<p>Sir, As I occupy a quasi military position under this State, I deem it
</p>
<p>proper to acquaint you that I accepted such position when Louisiana was
</p>
<p>a State in the Union, and when the motto of the seminary was inserted in
</p>
<p>marble over the main door, By the liberality of the general Government qf
</p>
<p>the United States. The Union Esto Perpetua. Recent events foreshadow a
</p>
<p>great change, and it becomes all men to choose. If Louisiana withdraws
</p>
<p>from the Federal Union I prefer to maintain my allegiance to the old Con
</p>
<p>stitution as long as a fragment of it survives ; and my longer stay here
</p>
<p>would be wrong in every sense of the word. In that event I beg you
</p>
<p>will send or appoint some authorized agent to take charge of the arms

</p>
<p>position should be made of them.
</p>
<p>And, furthermore, as President of the Board of Supervisors, I beg you
</p>
<p>to take immediate steps to relieve me, as Superintendent, the moment
</p>
<p>the State determines to secede, for on no earthly account will I do any
</p>
<p>act or think any thought hostile to or in defiance of the old Government
</p>
<p>of the United States. With great respect,
</p>
<p>I (Signed) W. T. Sherman.
</p>
<p>HIS GREAT CAMPAIGNS. 195
</p>
<p>This letter was written only eight days before the State passed the
</p>
<p>ordinance of secession. His resignation was accepted, and his patriotic
</p>
<p>devotion left him without employment. He went immediately to St. Louis,
</p>
<p>Mo., where he was engaged by Mr. Lucas, his old banking friend, at a
</p>
<p>yearly salary of $2000 to act as superintendent of a city railroad. Duty
</p>
<p>to his Government had caused him to make the pecuniary sacrifice of
</p>
<p>$3000 a year before engaging in anything hostile against it.
</p>
<p>Patriotism afterwards induced him to offer his services and life, if need
</p>
<p>be, to put dowji its enemies. He repaired to Washington and offered
</p>
<p>his services to aid in putting down treason and traitors. General McDowell
</p>
<p>gave him a Colonelcy of the 13th Regular U. S. Infantry, dated May 14th,
</p>
<p>1861. He was on the 3d of August same year promoted to Brigadier
</p>
<p>General of Volunteers, and sent into Kentucky to assist Anderson, of
</p>
<p>Sumter fame, who then had command of that Department. In Novem
</p>
<p>ber, 1862, with too many troops to be sacrificed, and too few to com
</p>
<p>mence offensive operations, he requested Secretary Cameron who was then
</p>
<p>on a visit to his headquarters to send him more men. Cameron enquired of
</p>
<p>him how many troops he thought it would take to commence the offen
</p>
<p>sive. Sherman then explained to him the difficulty of marching into
</p>
<p>Tennessee by divergent Unes  one to Nashville and the other to East
</p>
<p>Tennessee  with forces largely outnumbered by the Rebel armies con
</p>
<p>fronting him. On one of these lines he had 4,300 men to meet an oppos
</p>
<p>ing force of 18,000.
</p>
<p>When asked by Secretary Cameron how many men were needed for the
</p>
<p>present campaign, he (Sherman) replied, " Sixty thousand ; and before
</p>
<p>you can reduce the South to subjugation you must have 200,000."
</p>
<p>To this then apparently exorbitant demand the Secretary refused to
</p>
<p>comply ; and Sherman asked to be relieved, which Cameron did, and sent
</p>
<p>General Buell to take charge,
</p>
<p>Sherman now went to Benton Barracks near St, Louis, Mo, Here,
</p>
<p>sitting in the old Planter's House with Culluni, the plan of the first cam
</p>
<p>paign of Tennessee -was canvassed and decided on. Sherman, in a
</p>
<p>speech to the people of St. Louis, says :
</p>
<p>' ' General Halleck is the author of that first beginning, and I give him
</p>
<p>credit for it with pleasure, [Cheers.] Laying down his pencil upon the

<p>map, he said, ' There is the line and we must take it.' The capture of
</p>
<p>the forts on the Tennessee river by the troops led by Grant followed.
</p>
<p>[Cheers.] These were the grand strategetic features of that first move
</p>
<p>ment, and it succeeded perfectly."
</p>
<p>" General Halleck' s plan went further  not to stop at his first hne, which
</p>
<p>ran through Columbus, Bowling Green, crossing the river at Henry and
</p>
<p>Donelson, but to push on to the second line, which ran through Mem
</p>
<p>phis and Charleston ; but troubles intervened at Nashville, and delays
</p>
<p>196 GENERAL SHERMAN AND
</p>
<p>followed ; opposition to the last movement was made, and I myself was
</p>
<p>brought an actor on the scene."
</p>
<p>General Grant was now preparing to move on Fort Donelson, and Sher
</p>
<p>man was entrusted with superintending the forwarding of reinforcements
</p>
<p>and supplies, being stationed at Paducah, Kentucky.
</p>
<p>After the capture of Fort Donelson, he was put in command of the 5th
</p>
<p>Division of Grant's army. And under the lead of General C. F. Smith he
</p>
<p>ascended the Tennessee; river to Pittsburg Landing. Here and At Shiloh,
</p>
<p>the 6th and 7th of April, 1862, his coolness and bravery on the field has
</p>
<p>seldom been surpassed, having, had four horses shot under him. Ho
</p>
<p>could be seen everywhere in the thickest of the fight with face black
</p>
<p>ened with powder and besmeared with blood. Wounded himself, his
</p>
<p>daring in these battles will compare with Saladin, or equal Arabia's mad
</p>
<p>prophet through the bloody conflicts of Eastern war. With eyes full
</p>
<p>pf smoldering fire, when every one around him was excited, he was calm
</p>
<p>and collected. He looked the perfection of everything human. The in
</p>
<p>carnation ideal of the God of War.
</p>
<p>"In person, " says Major Nicholson, his aide-de-camp, " he is nearly
</p>
<p>six feet in height, with a wiry, muscular, and not ungraceful frame. His
</p>
<p>age is only forty-seven years, but his face is furrowed with deep linos,
</p>
<p>indicating care and profound thought. With surprising rapidity, how
</p>
<p>ever, these strong lines disappear when he talks with children and women.
</p>
<p>His eyes are of a dark brown color, and sharp and quick in expression.
</p>
<p>His forehead is broad and fair, sloping gently at the top of the head,
</p>
<p>which is covered with thick and light brown hair, closely trimmed. His
</p>
<p>beard and moustache, of a sandy hue, are also closely cut. Hi3 consti
</p>
<p>tution is iron. Exposure to cold, rain, or burning heat seems to produce
</p>
<p>no effect upon his powers of endurance and strength. Under the most
</p>
<p>harassing conditions I have never seen him exhibit symptoms of fatigue.
</p>
<p>In the field he retires early, but at midnight he may be found pacing in
</p>
<p>front of his tent. He falls asleep as easily and quickly as a little child 
</p>
<p>by the roadside, upon the wet ground, on the hard floor, or when a battle
</p>
<p>rages near him. No circumstance of time or place seems to affect him.
</p>
<p>His mien is never clumsy or common place ; and when mounted upon re

</p>
<p>view he appears in every way the great Soldier that he is."
</p>
<p>General Halleck in his dispatch to the War Department says : " It is the
</p>
<p>unanimous opinion here that Sherman saved the fate of the day on the 6th,
</p>
<p>and contributed largely to the glorious victory of the 7th." The Union
</p>
<p>forces engaged in these battles numbered 38,000 men. Sherman says :
</p>
<p>" Grant was there, and others of us, all young at that time, and unknown
</p>
<p>men, but our enemy was old, and Sidney Johnston, whom all the officers
</p>
<p>remembered as a power among the old officers, high above Grant, myself,
</p>
<p>or anybody else, led the enemy on that battle-field, and I almost wonder
</p>
<p>his great Campaigns. 197
</p>
<p>how we conquered. But as I remarked, it was a contest for manhood 
</p>
<p>man to man  soldier to soldier. We fought, and we held our ground,
</p>
<p>and therefore accounted ourselves victorious."
</p>
<p>At General Halleck's suggestion Sherman was again promoted to the
</p>
<p>rank of Major General of Volunteers, dated May 1st, 1862.
</p>
<p>Corinth, the junction of the Mobile, Ohio, Charleston and Memphis
</p>
<p>railroads, was a very important position, and the rebel authorities sent
</p>
<p>Beauregard to defend it.
</p>
<p>Although Sherman was yet in subordinate command, his division was
</p>
<p>in the advance ; and on the 17th, 21st, and 27th of May met the rebels on
</p>
<p>the road near Corinth and fought some desperate battles. His command
</p>
<p>was first inside the rebel intrenchments at Corinth on May 28th, and on
</p>
<p>the morning of the 29th the rebels evacuated and fired the town.
</p>
<p>Sherman was ordered to advance on Holly Springs, Miss., to take pos
</p>
<p>session and destroy the railroad running1 from Jackson, Tennessee, to
</p>
<p>New Orleans. After burning long stretches of trestle-work on the Missis
</p>
<p>sippi Central Railroad, he entered and took possession of Holly Springs
</p>
<p>June 20th.
</p>
<p>July 11th, 1862, General Halleck was ordered to Washington to the
</p>
<p>high position of Generalissimo. He re-organized the army, and placed
</p>
<p>General Grant in command of the department of West Tennessee. Mem
</p>
<p>phis had surrendered June 6th ; but the region was much infested with
</p>
<p>guerillas and contraband traders. General Grant sent Sherman to take
</p>
<p>command of this important position. He was here placed in com
</p>
<p>mand of the 15th army eorps ; and eventually ordered to sail for Friars
</p>
<p>Point, eighteen miles below Helena, Arkansas, to be in position to coop
</p>
<p>erate with the main body of the troops against Vicksburg under General
</p>
<p>Grant, who wer3 in the vicinity of the Tallahatchie River. In his order
</p>
<p>issued for the march, Sherman showed no mercy to speculators. The
</p>
<p>fleet consisted of one hundred arid twenty-seven steamers, besides gun
</p>
<p>boats. The General's headquarters with his staff was on board the Forest
</p>
<p>Queen. On the 24th of December, 1862, the fleet was at Milhken's Bend.
</p>
<p>On Christmas day the advance moved up the Vazoo River, about three
</p>
<p>miles above that portion of the stream called Old River. This was the

</p>
<p>position of the right. The left extended to within three miles of Haine'a
</p>
<p>Bluff. Sherman says: "After the Tallahatchie hne was carried,Vicksburg
</p>
<p>was the next point. I went with a small and hastily collected force, and
</p>
<p>repeatedly endeavored to make a lodgment on the bluff between Vicks
</p>
<p>burg and Haine's Bluffs, while General Grant moved with his main army
</p>
<p>so as to place himself on the high plateau behind Vicksburg." The hank
</p>
<p>of the Tazoo is about thirty feet high at the above place, covered with
</p>
<p>an undergrowth of willows, briers, thorns, vines, and live oaks twined
</p>
<p>together. It was a difficult place to land troops, and it was dark before
</p>
<p>198 GENERAL SHERMAN AND
</p>
<p>all the troops got ashore. Advancing from this position the right wing
</p>
<p>of the army of the Tennessee reached Vicksburg on Saturday morning,
</p>
<p>December 27th. Colonel Murphy, whom General Grant had commanded
</p>
<p>to hold Holly Springs, to prevent a raid on his rear, had cowardly sur
</p>
<p>rendered the post and prevented Grant from meeting Sherman at the ap
</p>
<p>pointed time and place. The line of battle was formed and Sherman or
</p>
<p>dered a charge to be made on the enemy's works which could be seen on
</p>
<p>the hillside. In the first charge these hardy Western boys had driven
</p>
<p>the rebels over a mile from their original position. The surrender of
</p>
<p>Holly Springs was yet unknown to General Sherman, and he was expect
</p>
<p>ing to hear the roar of General Grant's artillery every moment. Sher
</p>
<p>man remarks : " On the very day I had agreed to be there I was there.
</p>
<p>I waited anxiously for a co-operating force inland and below us, but they
</p>
<p>did not come ; and after I had made the assault I learned that the depot
</p>
<p>at Holly Springs had been broken up, and that General Grant had sent
</p>
<p>me word not to attempt it. But it was too late. Nevertheless, although
</p>
<p>we were unable to carry it at first, there were other things to be done."
</p>
<p>The attack was renewed again on Monday, but without success. The
</p>
<p>strong natural position of the enemy, with their well-chosen and strongly
</p>
<p>built fortifications, and his immense force, were obstacles that could not
</p>
<p>be overcome. If Sherman's men gained any advantage the tide was im
</p>
<p>mediately turned against them by overwhelming numbers. General's
</p>
<p>Morgan, Steel, Thayer and Blair's divisions, with Hoffman's and Griffin's
</p>
<p>batteries drove the rebels from their rifle-pits, but it was found impos
</p>
<p>sible to hold them in the charge up the hill. The Union army lost heavily ;
</p>
<p>General Blair had 1,825 men in his brigade ; his loss was 642 killed,
</p>
<p>wounded, and captured.
</p>
<p>The dead were buried under a Bag of truce, and General Sherman or
</p>
<p>dered his troops to re-embark. Aboutthis time General McClernand ar
</p>
<p>rived at the scene of action. He ranked General Sherman about one
</p>
<p>month in the date of his commission. He immediately ordered the with
</p>
<p>drawal of the vessels from the Yazoo back again into the Mississippi
</p>
<p>river, and changed the title of the Army of Tennessee to Army of the
</p>
<p>Mississippi. General Sherman announces the change in command in an

<p>order on hoard of the Forest Queen, dated at Milliken's Bend, January
</p>
<p>4th, 1863. He says : " Ours was but part of a combined movement in
</p>
<p>which others were to assist. We were on time ; unforeseen contingencies
</p>
<p>must have delayed the others. A new commander is now here to lead
</p>
<p>you. He is chosen by the President of the United States, who is charged
</p>
<p>by the Constitution to maintain and defend it, and he has the undoubted
</p>
<p>right to select his own agents. I know that all good officers and sol
</p>
<p>diers will give him the same hearty support and. cheerful obedience they
</p>
<p>have heretofore given me."
</p>
<p>HIS GREAT CAMPAIGNS. 199
</p>
<p>On the morning of the 9th, the fleet with all on board, moved up the
</p>
<p>Mississippi. The White Cloud and City of Memphis carried the wounded
</p>
<p>and sick. Arkansas Post, lying nearly north of Vicksburg, was the object
</p>
<p>of the expedition. On January 11th, 1863, by the combined forces of
</p>
<p>General McClernand and Admiral Porter, the works were stormed, and
</p>
<p>the place captured at one o'clock. Over 7,000 prisoners with all their
</p>
<p>stores, animals, and munitions of war were taken.
</p>
<p>General McClernand in changing the name of the army divided it into
</p>
<p>two eorps. One commanded by General G. W. Morgan, and the other
</p>
<p>by General Sherman. The latter, although superseded, and somewhat
</p>
<p>chagrined at his previous unsuccess, contributed largely with his corps
</p>
<p>to secure the capture of the Post.
</p>
<p>Sherman having command of the 15th corps, was sent with it by Gen
</p>
<p>eral Grant to make a feigned attack on Haine's Bluff on the Yazoo River.
</p>
<p>Grant remarks : " Sherman, I want you to move upon Haines' Bluff to
</p>
<p>enable me to pass to the next fort below  Grand Gulf. ' ' This move was
</p>
<p>made to prevent the rebel commander at Vicksburg from sending troops
</p>
<p>to the assistance of Grand Gulf. With ten steamers, Sherman again moved
</p>
<p>his men, April 29th, from Milliken's Bend up the Yazoo to Chickasaw
</p>
<p>Bayou, and from there with Admiral Porter and his gun-boats the next
</p>
<p>day the entire force pushed forward to the port. Porter opened the bom
</p>
<p>bardment and continued it four hours. He then retired, and Sherman in
</p>
<p>full view of the rebels commenced landing his troops. After all had got
</p>
<p>ashore, the naval force again advanced and renewed the bombardment.
</p>
<p>The rebels now rallied all their available strength to resist an assault
</p>
<p>which they momentarily expected. The Ruse was a success. Sherman
</p>
<p>says : " I did make the feint on Haines's Bluff, and by that means Grant
</p>
<p>ran the blockade easily to Grand Gulf, and made a lodgment down there,
</p>
<p>and got his army up on the high plateau in the rear of Vicksburgif while
</p>
<p>the people north were beguiled into the belief that Sherman was again
</p>
<p>repulsed. But we did not repose confidence in everybody. Then fol
</p>
<p>lowed the movement on Jackson, and the 4th of July placed us in posses
</p>
<p>sion of that great stronghold, Vicksburg ; and then, as Mr. Lincoln said,
</p>
<p>' the Mississippi went unvexed to the sea.' " General Sherman with his

</p>
<p>force went from here to Young's Point, and then to Hard Times on the
</p>
<p>Mississippi, distance about four miles from Grand Gulf. His column
</p>
<p>reached Hard Times on the morning of May 6th, and on the same even
</p>
<p>ing commenced crossing the ferry to join General Grant.
</p>
<p>On the 12th of May, Sherman and McClernand's forces fought the reb-
</p>
<p>els at Fourteen Mile Creek, while General McPherson defeated a strong
</p>
<p>force at Raymond. From these points all three commanders advanGod
</p>
<p>on and drove the rebel General Johnston out of Jackson, Mississippi.
</p>
<p>McPherson and McClernand turned their troops and marched on Bolton,
</p>
<p>200 GENERAL SHERMAN AND
</p>
<p>leaving Sherman at Jackson from which point, by order of General Grant
</p>
<p>May 16th, he was instructed to make a forced march of twenty miles
</p>
<p>and join the main force at Dalton. Sherman continued his march to
</p>
<p>Bridgeport, and reached there by noon the' next day.
</p>
<p>From this point, May 18th, before dawn, he commenced his advance
</p>
<p>on Vicksburg. General Grant says of Sherman's late movement : "His
</p>
<p>demonstration at Haine's Bluff in April to hold the enemy about Vicks
</p>
<p>burg while the army was securing a foothold east of the Mississippi ;
</p>
<p>his rapid marches to join the army afterwards ; his management at Jack
</p>
<p>son, Mississippi, in the first attack ; his almost unequaled march from Jack
</p>
<p>son to Bridgeport, and the passage of the Black River ; his securing
</p>
<p>Walnut Hills on the 18th of May, attests, his great merit as a soldier."
</p>
<p>The position gained by Sherman on the 11th, was of great value in
</p>
<p>making the attack on Vicksburg. The place being too strong to be car
</p>
<p>ried by assault, that mode was abandoned, and the place had to he ap
</p>
<p>proached by a protracted siege, resulting in its capture July 4th, 1863.
</p>
<p>All this time General Johnston, with a large rebel force, had been
</p>
<p>threatening General Grant's rear. He immediately sent a message to
</p>
<p>Sherman that he must whip Johnston fifteen miles from here. Johnston
</p>
<p>fell back upou Jackson. Sherman was now, put in command of all the
</p>
<p>troops that was designated to look after Johnston, and the day fixed by
</p>
<p>General Grant to commence the grand assault on Vicksburg was July the
</p>
<p>6th. Pemberton having surrendered on the 4th, left Sherman free to
</p>
<p>move on the 6th against Johnston, who was preparing to make a stand
</p>
<p>at Jackson.
</p>
<p>On the 11th of July, Sherman's soldiers discovered secreted in an old
</p>
<p>building, Jeff. Davis's library and private correspondence. Among the
</p>
<p>latter were found letters of sympathy, encouragement and justification
</p>
<p>from many Northern traitors. A gold-headed cane bearing the inscrip
</p>
<p>tion : To Jefferson Davis, from Franklin Pierce. These trophies were
</p>
<p>found by a foraging party in the country a few miles from Jackson, where
</p>
<p>Jeff, had stored them away for safety.
</p>
<p>On the 13th, midst a heavy fog, Johnston made an attack on Sherman's
</p>
<p>defences, but was repulsed. On the morning of the 16th, the rebel

<p>bands were discoursing rebel airs on their works in face of our troops.
</p>
<p>On the next morning it was discovered that Johnston had sneaked out,
</p>
<p>leaving the town of Jackson in ruins. The 15th army corps now occu
</p>
<p>pied, about twenty miles along the Big Black River, for the purpose of
</p>
<p>preventing raids from the enemy. Many of the Union soldiers died while
</p>
<p>in this unhealthy region, amidst the sultry air and poisonous vapors.
</p>
<p>While encamped here Mrs. Sherman and family came from their Western
</p>
<p>home to enjoy for a short time the society of their protector. In this
</p>
<p>sxkly region ihs child that bore hia father's name contracted a fever and

<p>died in Memphis on their return home. He was a promising boy, born in
</p>
<p>San Francisco, California, June 8th, 1854, and died in Memphis, Tennes
</p>
<p>see, October 3d, 1863. A monument was erected by the 13th Regimei.t
</p>
<p>of Regular United States Infantry, over his remains.
</p>
<p>This was the regiment that General McDowell gave Sherman command
</p>
<p>of in the capacity of Colonel, in 1861.
</p>
<p>General Rosecrans, who had command of the Army of the Cumberland,
</p>
<p>was struggling to hold the region between Vicksburg and Charleston and
</p>
<p>at the battle of Chickamauga, 19th and 20th September, had been unsuc
</p>
<p>cessful in his encounter with Bragg, and retreated to Chattanooga.
</p>
<p>From Memphis to Chattanooga the distance is about 309 miles, and the
</p>
<p>Memphis and Charleston railroad connect them. Between the two places
</p>
<p>the Tennessee and Elk rivers cross the country, many of whose bridges
</p>
<p>were destroyed by the rebels.
</p>
<p>General Grant had been put in command of the departments of the Ohio ,
</p>
<p>of the Cumberland, and of the Tennessee. General Thomas had succeeded
</p>
<p>Rosecrans in the Department of the Cumberland. General Grant arrived
</p>
<p>at Chattanooga October 23d, 1863. Although the rebels had assembled
</p>
<p>at Salem and Tuscumbia to prevent Sherman making a juncture with Rose
</p>
<p>crans. At Colliersville and Cane Creek battles were fought, after which
</p>
<p>General Sherman organized atluka his new command, and on the its of-
</p>
<p>November, with his army, crossed the Tennessee and passed on towards
</p>
<p>Elk river, here he was forced to take a circuitous route along the stream
</p>
<p>byway of Fayetteville, marking out the route for the different divisions
</p>
<p>of his army, he hastened on to Bridgeport, and telegraphed General Grant
</p>
<p>the position of his force, and on the loth day of November leaving his
</p>
<p>army at Bridgeport, he arrived at Chattanooga at the headquarters of
</p>
<p>General Grant.
</p>
<p>On the 23d, three divisions unobservedly had obtained a position be
</p>
<p>hind the hills opposite the mouth of the Chickamauga. The next morn
</p>
<p>ing was darkened by a drizzling rain and fog. Before day the pontoon
</p>
<p>bridge 300 feet long was commenced, and before three o'clock P.M.
</p>
<p>8000 troops were on the other side at the foot of Missionary Ridge. From
</p>
<p>this position they began to ascend the hill, completely surprising the en

<p>emy. The entire hills were studded with rebel works, towering to the
</p>
<p>very clouds. So perfectly secure did Bragg feel, that he sent Long-
</p>
<p>street's entire corps to engage Burnsids at Knoxville. On the 24th, says
</p>
<p>Grant, the whole northern extremity of Missionary Ridge to near the Tun
</p>
<p>nel was in Sherman's possession. On the morning of the 25th he was
</p>
<p>again in the saddle. General Coarse was to have the advance, and just
</p>
<p>about sunrise his bugle sounded, forward. Sherman's force was left on
</p>
<p>the outer spur of Missionary Ridge, with his right abreast of the Tunnel.
</p>
<p>His position served to draw the enemy's fire from the assaulting parties
</p>
<p>202 GENERAL SHERMAN AND
</p>
<p>on the hill. At 10 A.M. the fight raged furiously. General Coarse was
</p>
<p>severely wounded. Two brigades of reinforcements were sent up, but
</p>
<p>they became so crowded that they were compelled to fall away to the
</p>
<p>west of the hill. A heavy force of the enemy now emerged from under
</p>
<p>cover of the thick undergrowth on the right and rear of the supporting
</p>
<p>columns, which forced them to fall back in some confusion to the lower
</p>
<p>edge of the field, where they formed in good order. General Coarse, Col
</p>
<p>onel Loomis, and General M. L. Smith still held the attacking column
</p>
<p>proper up at the crest. General Grant says they held their position, al
</p>
<p>though advanced to the very rifle-pits, without wavering, when the two
</p>
<p>reserved brigades fell back. Sherman says, the enemy made a show of
</p>
<p>pursuit, but was caught in the flank by a well-directed fire of one brig
</p>
<p>ade, and forced to seek cover behind the hill. Sherman was attacking
</p>
<p>the mostnorthern and vital point of the enemy's position. His stores were
</p>
<p>at Chickamauga, directly in Sherman's rear, which kept them uneasy for
</p>
<p>their safety. On this account the enemy moved a large force to dislodge
</p>
<p>him. Sherman says column after column was streaming towards me.
</p>
<p>Grant kept his eye fixed on this key-point and sent a division to aid, but
</p>
<p>Sherman sent back word he could hold with his present force. Hooker
</p>
<p>had swept gallantly round the enemy's left. When Grant saw the main
</p>
<p> effort of the enemy was directed against Sherman's centre, or Missionary
</p>
<p>Ridge, he ordered General Thomas to strike their left flank. He broke
</p>
<p>in the centre of the long line. They turned, but too late ; while Thomas
</p>
<p>swept everything before him, from ridge to ridge. Bragg was over
</p>
<p>whelmingly defeated, and his routed demoralized force driven down into
</p>
<p>the vallies of Georgia. This was on the 25th of November. The victory
</p>
<p>of Chattanooga was made complete.
</p>
<p>General Sherman at four o'clock, on the morning of the 26th, with part
</p>
<p>of General Howard's eleventh corps was in pursuit. They came up to
</p>
<p>the enemy's rear, and a fight was commenced which lasted till darkness
</p>
<p>closed in. On 27th, all the armies of Hooker and Thomas sharing in the
</p>
<p>pursuit, marching and fighting. Sherman now sent Howard to destroy
</p>
<p>the railroad between Dalton and Cleveland. This cut the communication
</p>
<p>between Bragg and Longstreet, and turned the flank of the enemy who

</p>
<p>were now engaging Hooker at Ringgold. The enemy had now been
</p>
<p>driven from this part of Tennessee. Sherman entered Ringgold and met
</p>
<p>Genera] Grant, who ordered him to leisurely return with his army back
</p>
<p>to Chattanooga. The next day Sherman tore up the railroad between
</p>
<p>Graysville and Ringgold to the Georgia State-line ; and General Grant
</p>
<p>consented that Sherman might make a circuitous route north, as far as
</p>
<p>theHiawassee. This was in the latter part of November. Burnside, who
</p>
<p>was at Knoxville, sent Grant an urgent appeal for relief, stating that he
</p>
<p>could only hold out until December 3d. Grant had aheady ordered
</p>
<p>HIS GREAT CAMPAIGNS. 203
</p>
<p>Granger to push on to the relief of Burnside, but the emergency was such
</p>
<p>that a more energetic commander was needed to save Knoxville from be
</p>
<p>ing captured by Longstreet. Grant gave this expedition in charge of
</p>
<p>Sherman, including the troops under Granger's command. Burnside had
</p>
<p>about 12000 men in the mountain town of Knoxville, which was about 84
</p>
<p>miles distant, and relief must come to them in three days. At daylight
</p>
<p>the army passed the Hiawassee and marched to Athens, fifteen miles on
</p>
<p>the 2d day of December. They reached London, 26 miles distant. Here
</p>
<p>they had a fight with the rebel General Vaughn, who they found strongly
</p>
<p>posted, building earthworks, with artillery. When Howard's infantry
</p>
<p>arrived, it was night, and before morning Vaughn had run three locomo
</p>
<p>tives and forty-eight cars into the Tennessee river, and evacuated the
</p>
<p>position, leaving four guns and a large quantity of provisions. Sherman
</p>
<p>now sent word to Colonel Long, cavalry commander, that Burnside must
</p>
<p>know in 24 hours of his approach. It was yet a distance of 40 miles to
</p>
<p>Knoxville. At daylight the cavahy was off; and the 15th corps was
</p>
<p>turned from Philadelphia to Morgentown ; but here the Tennessee was too
</p>
<p>deep to ford, and General Wilson constructed a bridge made partly from
</p>
<p>the houses of the late village of Morgentown, and by dark, December
</p>
<p>4th, the bridge was down, and the troops crossing. Long's cavalry had
</p>
<p>reached Knoxville on the night of the 3d, and on the morning of the 5th
</p>
<p>Sherman received word from Burnside that all was well. On the same
</p>
<p>evening a staff officer from Burnside rode up to announce that Longstreet
</p>
<p>had raised the siege.
</p>
<p>Itwas in the early part of 1864 General Sherman planned a new and im
</p>
<p>portant expedition, the object was nothing less than the capture of Mo
</p>
<p>bile, Alabama. In maturing his plans he discovered, by verging a little
</p>
<p>from a direct line his army would pass through the richest corn and cotton
</p>
<p>fields of the .South, which were known to be swarming with slaves. By
</p>
<p>taking this course he would not only give the enemy a severe blow at one
</p>
<p>of his important points of subsistence, but he would be enabled to get
</p>
<p>between Johnston's army and Mobile, so as to assist Commodore Farra-
</p>
<p>gut in its capture, by hurling his legions against it from the land side.
</p>

<p>my corps, commanded respectfully by Hurlburt and the gallant McPher
</p>
<p>son, left Vicksburg February 3d. General W. S. Smith who was also to
</p>
<p>take part, was to leave Memphis, Tennessee; with 8000 cavahy two days
</p>
<p>before and was commanded to join Sherman about 150 miles from Vicks
</p>
<p>burg, at Meridian. After crossing the Big Black River and moving along
</p>
<p>by Champion Hills and Clinton, Sherman was met at Jackson by Hurlburt
</p>
<p>and McPherson, who had taken different roules. Parts of his army were
</p>
<p>here united. And some resistance was offered by the rebels, at Line Creek ;
</p>
<p>skirmishing took place, but the enemy fell back, while Sherman pushed

</p>
<p>on, taking the towns of Quitman and Enterprise, reaching the Big Chunky
</p>
<p>River and Meridian, February 13th.
</p>
<p>It was at this place and time General Smith from Memphis, with 8000
</p>
<p>cavalry, was commanded to join General Sherman, but instead of doing
</p>
<p>so he had only left Memphis that day, February 13th, and instead of get
</p>
<p>ting 8000, he only had procured 3000 cavalry. With this small force" he
</p>
<p>was 13 days behind time, and 200 miles distant away. This failure com
</p>
<p>pelled Sherman to abandon further prosecution of the Mobile part of the
</p>
<p>enterprise ; and after tearing up the Mississippi Central Railroad from
</p>
<p>Jackson to Meridian, and destroying the rebel machine shop, then in full
</p>
<p>blast at the latter place, and dispersing the rebel force stationed there, he
</p>
<p>thought it hazardous to go further Without cavalry and returned. Although
</p>
<p>all was not accomplished anticipated at the outset, on account of General
</p>
<p>Smith's failure, yet glorious results were achieved in liberating about
</p>
<p>8000 slaves, who followed the army on its return, like the Exodus of
</p>
<p>the Israelites from Egypt, taking with them the costly vehicles and luxu
</p>
<p>ries of their terror-stricken masters, who fled at Sherman's approach.
</p>
<p>Four thousand rebel prisoners, thousands of horses, mules, and cattle
</p>
<p>were brought away, and over $2,000,000 worth of rebel property de
</p>
<p>stroyed. The expedition returned to Vicksburg with trifling loss ; (while
</p>
<p>Sherman went to New Orleans on the gunboat Diana) having been
</p>
<p>absent about a month. While at Meridian, February 13th, Sherman con
</p>
<p>gratulated his troops in these words :
</p>
<p>" The General commanding conveys his congratulations and thanks to
</p>
<p>the officers and men composing this command for the most successful ac
</p>
<p>complishment of one of the great problems of the War. Meridian the great
</p>
<p>railway centre- of the southwest is now in our possession, and by industry
</p>
<p>and hard work can be rendered useless to the enemy, and deprive him of
</p>
<p>the chief source of supply to his armies. Secrecy in plan and rapidity
</p>
<p>of execution accomplish the best results of war ; and the General com
</p>
<p>manding assures all that by followig their leaders fearlessly and with
</p>
<p>confidence, they will in time reap the reward so dear to us all  a peace

<p>that will never again be disturbed in our country by a discontented mi

</p>
<p>206 GENERAL SHERMAN AND
</p>
<p>the failure of General Smith to cooperate, now that he was invested with
</p>
<p>supreme command, at first contemplated an advance on Richmond by
</p>
<p>way of Lynchburg, Virginia, making Knoxville, in East Tennessee, his
</p>
<p>base. Every military man could see that Lynchburg was the key to the
</p>
<p>rebel position of the East. But Sherman saw that with 100,000 men it
</p>
<p>would be impossible to protect his long line of supplies, most of which
</p>
<p>came from LouisyiUe, Kentucky, and at the same time protect Middle
</p>
<p>Tennessee from invasion. Longstreet, the rebel commander, who had
</p>
<p>been wintering his army in East Tennessee, hearing General Schofield was
</p>
<p>making preparations to move on Knoxville, and believing it only the ad
</p>
<p>vance of Sherman's entire force, withdrew from East Tennessee before
</p>
<p>the campaigning season commenced. Sherman, therefore, gave up the
</p>
<p>contemplated Richmond enterprise ; and as this left Johnston in command
</p>
<p>of the only large rebel army in the southwest, he resolved to pursue him
</p>
<p>into Georgia.
</p>
<p>The grand advance in pursuit of Johnston commenced about the 7th of
</p>
<p>May. He was strongly fortified at Buzzard Roost, with his outpost
</p>
<p>extending to Tunnel Hill. General Thomas drove the rebels from this
</p>
<p>place on the 7th, and on the 11th, under the entire rebel fire, occupied
</p>
<p>Buzzard Roost. The former is a narrow gorge or pass in the Chatoogato
</p>
<p>Mountains, flanked on one side by Rocky Faced Ridge (not unlike the
</p>
<p>Palisades of the Hudson River) , and on the other by the greater but less
</p>
<p>percipitous elevation called John's Mountain. This gorge was com
</p>
<p>manded on the Dalton side by an ampitheater of hiUs, which, as well as
</p>
<p>Rocfcy Face and John's Mountain, was crowned with batteries, lined with
</p>
<p>infantry, and terraced by sharp shooters.
</p>
<p>The only pass through the mountain was the railroad and wagon road,
</p>
<p>and Johnston had dammed a neighboring mountain stream and conveyed
</p>
<p>it into the gorge so that the water over the wagon and railroad track
</p>
<p>was from eight to ten feet deep. In addition, piles were driven down filling
</p>
<p>the defile, which made an additional barrier. It was so strong a position,
</p>
<p>that the rebels felt perfectly secure, as they believed it unassailable.
</p>
<p>Fighting had commenced at Tunnel Hill, and after two days reconnoissance
</p>
<p>and sharp skirmishing, proved to General Sherman that an attack in front

</p>
<p>would be attended with too great a waste of life, he resolved that the pass
</p>
<p>must be turned, in looking about how to do it, he discovered a pass
</p>
<p>about fifteen miles to the southwest called Snake Creek Gap. Rising on
</p>
<p>one side is Rocky Face, with its flint sides, on the other, Oak Knob.
</p>
<p>The deep dark forests concealed the movements of the troops under
</p>
<p>General Morgan, and others kept the rebels in constant dread of an
</p>
<p>assault. A corporal of Company I, sixteenth Illinois, broke from the line (so J
</p>
<p>says General Morgan,) and under cover of projecting ledges, got up
</p>
<p>HIS GREAT CAMPAIGNS. 207
</p>
<p>i
</p>
<p>within twenty eet of a squad of rebels on the summit. Taking shelter
</p>
<p>from the sharpshooters, he called out :
</p>
<p>" I say rebs, don't you want to hear Old Abe's Amnesty Proclamation
</p>
<p>read?" Yes, was the unanimous cry, give us the ape's Proclamation.
</p>
<p>" Attention!" commanded the corporal, and in a loud clear voice he
</p>
<p>read it; when he arrived at that part where the negro was referred to,
</p>
<p>the rebs cried out, none of your d  d abolitionism, look out for rocks.
</p>
<p>which they began to shower down over his hiding place. Do you want
</p>
<p>to hear it again cried the corporal ; not to-day you bloody yank, now
</p>
<p>crawl down, and we wont shoot, was the response.
</p>
<p>General Howard, in an elevated position on Rocky Face Ridge, seeing a
</p>
<p>squad of rebels upon a projecting ledge below. In the absence of hand
</p>
<p>grenades, the General, tired of gazing at them, lit the fuses of a few
</p>
<p>shells and dropped them down into the center of the group.
</p>
<p>The flank movement had now commenced in earnest, led on by Gene
</p>
<p>ral McPherson with the 15th and 16th corps, and Garrard's division of
</p>
<p>cavalry, supported by General Thomas with the 14th and 20th corps,
</p>
<p>whUe General Howard and Schofield, with the 4th and 23d corps, and
</p>
<p>Stoneman's division of cavahy amused the enemy in front. Suddenly
</p>
<p>General Johnston discovering that his strong position had been flanked,
</p>
<p>and his means of communication in danger of being cut off, abandoned
</p>
<p>this Gibraltar of the South, and fell back upon Ressaca. This town is
</p>
<p>situated in GordonT!ounty, Georgia, on the north bank of the Coosawattee
</p>
<p>River which flows southwest, changing its name to the Oostalantee, and
</p>
<p>joins Etowah at Rome, the two forming the Coosa, whieh joins the
</p>
<p>Tallapoosa, forms the Alabama, and flows into the Gulf of Mobile.
</p>
<p>Ressaca is due south, about fifty-six miles by railroad from Chattanooga,
</p>
<p>and eighty-two miles by rail from Atlanta.
</p>
<p>The pursuit continued, and for three days the sound of battle could be
</p>
<p>heard among the hiUs, until Sherman on the 15th and 16th of May defeat
</p>
<p>ed the rebels, capturing six trains going south for supplies ; 1200 prison
</p>
<p>ers and eight guns, and a large quantity of stores. The rebels in their
</p>
<p>retreat from Ressaca destroyed the railroad bridge on the Western and

</p>
<p>From this position Johnston again fell back, directly pursued by Gene-
</p>
<p>_ral Thomas, while McPherson and Schofield took different routes. The
</p>
<p>conflict raging both by night and by day, the darkest hours of midnight
</p>
<p>frequently lit up by the flame of the guns. Over mountain and stream
</p>
<p>the brave Union army bore down on the retreating rebels. When near

<p>ment, when aU at once the bands of brigade after brigade struck in and
</p>
<p>made the hills resound with the music ; when they ceased to reverber
</p>
<p>ate, five thousand voices were raised in praise of God from whom all bless
</p>
<p>ings flow. After breakfast the soldiers of many hard fought battles
</p>
<p>broke camp and fell into line. General Thomas' troops, with the fearless
</p>
<p>Hooker in advance, was sweeping towards Dallas, when the enemy
</p>
<p>crossed their path. The action of New Hope Church came off here.
</p>
<p>General Stoneman captured from the Third Texas Cavalry a black flag

<p>uith a skelelon figured upon il, together with death's head and cross bones. This
</p>
<p>Texas company is said to have carried this flag from the first. Our boys
</p>
<p>after this took no prisoners from the Third Texas cavalry.
</p>
<p>General McPherson's corps did the principal part of the fighting at
</p>
<p>DaUas. The loss of the rebels amounted to about 5,500 kUled, wounded
</p>
<p>and prisoners. The month of May had closed1 with the battle at Dallas.
</p>
<p>The troops had been pressing hard down on the rebel force, fighting and
</p>
<p>marching from Chattanooga, now about one hundred miles. Itwas a her
</p>
<p>culean task ; but the glorious army of the Union kept unbroken ranks. A
</p>
<p>battle was fought on the 21st of June. It is not our province to give aU
</p>
<p>tho skirmishes in the running fight, but only such as appeared directly
</p>
<p>fruitful of results. The battle of the 21st revealed the outposts of John
</p>
<p>ston's new and strong position at Lost Mountain, Pine HiU, and Kenesaw
</p>
<p>Mountain. Here he was found intrenched on these bold p;aks connected
</p>
<p>together by a line of ridges and his lines closely circumscribed by ours.
</p>
<p>No place were they more than a musket shot apart. This strong posi*

<p>on Kenesaw Mountain, on the railroad, four miles north of Marietta ; his

<p>left on Lost Mountain, some six miles west of Kenesaw. Between these
</p>
<p>two formidable ridges his forces had been graduaUy forced back from

<p>seems, after two days' skirmishing, we developed the enemy's position.
</p>
<p>A country robbed of its substance by its self-styled defenders, unable
</p>
<p>to, even feed its non-combatants who depended upon the Union army for
</p>
<p>food which had to be carried through a hostile country over a distance,
</p>
<p>of two hundred miles, on a single-track railroad. This was the situation
</p>
<p>when the mighty task of dislodging Johnston's rebel army from its last
</p>
<p>strong position was undertaken. An officer writing from the spot re
</p>
<p>marks : " The ridge in front of Kenesaw commences about Wallace's
</p>
<p>House on the Burnt Hickory and Marietta road, and extends thence across
</p>
<p>HIS GREAT CAMPAIGNS. 209
</p>
<p>the railroad behind Noonday Creek about two miles in an east-by-north
</p>
<p>direction. Lost Mountain and Kenesaw are about eleven hundred feet
</p>
<p>high ; Pine HiU and Brushy Hill about four hundred feet high, and the
</p>
<p>ridges everywhere about one hundred and fifty to two hundred feet, or
</p>
<p>about the same as, and, in fact, not very dissimilar to Missionary Ridge
</p>
<p>at Chattanooga. The enemy was strongly intrenched behind log barri
</p>
<p>cades, protected by earth thrown against them, with a ditch, formidable
</p>
<p>abatis, and in many places a, chevaux-de -frise of sharpened fence-rails
</p>
<p>besides. Their intrenchments were well protected by thick traverses,
</p>
<p>and at frequent intervals arranged with emplacements and embrasures
</p>
<p>for field-guns. The thickness of this parapet was generally six to eight
</p>
<p>feet at top on the infantry Une, and from twelve to fifteen feet thick at
</p>
<p>the top, where field-guns were posted, or where fire from our artillery
</p>
<p>was anticipated. . The amount of digging and intrenching that Johnston's
</p>
<p>army had done is almost incredible. General Sherman's tactics resulted
</p>
<p>in wresting Lost Mountain, Pine Hill, the ridge in front of Kenesaw, and
</p>
<p>Brushy Hill from the enemy, and forcing back his two wings, Kenesaw
</p>
<p>Mountain operating as a sort of hinge, until his left was behind Olley's
</p>
<p>Creek, and his right behind the stream which flows between the houses
</p>
<p>named on the map as McAffe and Wiley Roberts. Kenesaw Mountain
</p>
<p>then became the projecting fortress of the defensive Une, the wings be
</p>
<p>ing turned backward from it. It is a rocky eminence, rather precipi
</p>
<p>tous, thickly wooded, and crowned with batteries.
</p>
<p>" Our respective Unes were about eight or nine miles in length, from
</p>
<p>six hundred to seven hundred yards distant from each other, and strong
</p>
<p>ly intrenched. Skirmishing went on incessantly, and artillery duels oc
</p>
<p>curred two or three times daily. The enemy at different times made
</p>
<p>some dozen or more assaults, sometimes getting within fifty. yards of our
</p>
<p>intrenchments, but were always repulsed, and generaUy with heavy loss
</p>
<p>to them. To gain certain positions, we opened a heavy artiUery fire
</p>
<p>upon their whole line, pressed their two flanks heavily, and made as
</p>
<p>saults in two places upon their centre. The assaults were unsuccessful ;
</p>
<p>but the Twenty- third Corps, upon their extreme right, gained important
</p>
<p>advantages of position."

<p>The truly loyal do not demand any such explanations as these, for with

<p>late the Copperhead press, not content with misrepresenting and belit

<p>at General Sherman's generalship, and insinuate already, in the face of

<p>that from this eminence were transmitted, in those mysterious signals,

<p>Military Institute standing out prominently in the picture. Gazing down

<p>culiar impression photographed upon my mind by the swelling of this
</p>
<p>historical anthem of Freedom's first battle, as it grandly sailed over Pine
</p>
<p>Mountain. My reverie was soon disturbed by the sudden roar of many
</p>
<p>batteries belching out their savage peals with fearful rapidity from both

<p>sides, and for several minutes quite an artillery duel was indulged in,
</p>
<p>interspersed with short rolls of musketry. It was curious to watch the

</p>
<p>HIS GREAT CAMPAIGNS. 211
</p>
<p>" Among tho incidents of this part of the great campaign was a dress
</p>
<p>parade of the rebels on the top of Kenesaw Mountain. Our lines were
</p>
<p>so near, that the display was distinctly visible and audible. Below the
</p>
<p>regiment, whose bayonets gleamed in the rays of the setting sun, were
</p>
<p>the bristling rifle-pits. A courier suddenly dashed up to the adjutant,
</p>
<p>and handed him a despatch from General Johnston, announcing that
</p>
<p>General Sherman had brought his army so far south, that his line of
</p>
<p>supphes was longer than he could hold ; that he was too far from his
</p>
<p>base  just where their commanding general wished to get him ; that a
</p>
<p>part of their army would hold the railroad, thirty miles north of the
</p>
<p>Etowah ; and that the great railroad bridge at AUatoona had been com
</p>
<p>pletely destroyed ; that in a few days Sherman would be out of suppUes,
</p>
<p>because he could bring no more trains through by the railroad. They
</p>
<p>were urged to maintain a bold front, and in a few days the Yankees
</p>
<p>would be forced to retreat. Breathless silence evinces the attention
</p>
<p>which every word of the order receives, as the adjutant reads. Cheers
</p>
<p>are about to be given, when, hark ! loud whistles from Sherman's cars,
</p>
<p>at Big Shanty, interrupt them. The number of whistles increase. AUa
</p>
<p>toona, Ackworth, and Big Shanty depots resound with them. Supplies
</p>
<p>have arrived. The effect can easily be imagined. The illustration was
</p>
<p>so apt, the commentary so appropriate, that it was appreciated, at the
</p>
<p>jnstant. ' BuUy for the base of supplies ! ' ' Bully for the long line ! '
</p>
<p>' Three cheers for the big bridge ! ' ' Here's your Yankee cars ! ' ' There's
</p>
<p>Sherman's rations !' Bedlam was loose along their line for a short time.
</p>
<p>' ' There was a tree in front of General Herron's division of the Fifteenth
</p>
<p>Army Corps, to which was given the name of fatal tree. Seven soldiers
</p>
<p>in succession, who hid behind it to shoot, were killed. Then a board
</p>
<p>was put onthe tree, on which was chalked 'dangerous.' The rebels
</p>
<p>soon shot this sign to pieces, when a sergeant took his position there,
</p>
<p>and in less than two minutes two Minnie balls pierced his body, making
</p>
<p>the eighth victim of rebel bullets  a tragical item in war's dread work.

<p>gallant Thomas and Schofield immediately advanced, and soon found the
</p>
<p>foe strongly intrenched along a ridge of rocky hills, running from Kene
</p>
<p>saw to Lost Mountain. General McPherson crowded the rebel lines on
</p>
<p>the left, and on the 17th, just as General Sherman was about to order a
</p>
<p>212 GENERAL SHERMAN AND
</p>
<p>charge the enemy deserted his breastworks that connected Lost with
</p>
<p>Kenesaw Mountain. < Onwaid the victorious troops pursued until among
</p>
<p>the Kenesaw peaks they discovered the front lines of the enemy, the
</p>
<p>outer lines having fallen back to cover Marietta and the railroad to the
</p>
<p>Chattahoochie. General Hooker led the charge against this rebel strong
</p>
<p>hold. New York and Illinois regiments, here together, freely shed their
</p>
<p>patriotic blood on this mountain top. The 27th Illinois regiment suffered
</p>
<p>severely. Michael Delariey, its color-bearer, in advance of his regiment,
</p>
<p>after being wounded, leaped on the enemy's breastworks, holding aloft
</p>
<p>the starry banner of his country. While thus standing on the enemy's
</p>
<p>works, two rebels approached him on each side and thrust their bayo
</p>
<p>nets into his already wounded body. While thus mortaUy wounded, he
</p>
<p>clasped the flag to his breast and bore it back in safety to his comrades,
</p>
<p>where he soon after bled to death. On the night of July 2d, General
</p>
<p>McPherson threw his army in a position to threaten Nickajack Creek and
</p>
<p>Turner's Ferry across Chattahoochie. On the morning of the 3d, Kene
</p>
<p>saw was abandoned : our skirmishers could be seen on the mountain top.
</p>
<p>General Thomas' whole line was then moved forward to the railroad and
</p>
<p>turned south in pursuit of the retreating enemy. Marietta was entered
</p>
<p>at half past eight, A. M., just as the enemy's cavalry evacuated the
</p>
<p>place. Johnston had thrown up intrenchments across the road at
</p>
<p>Smyrna, camp-meeting ground, five miles from Marietta, but from this
</p>
<p>strong position again falls back.
</p>
<p>On the 4th of July the entire line of the enemy's pits were captured.
</p>
<p>The next morning he had abandoned Nickajack Creek and Turner's Ferry.
</p>
<p>General Sherman now moved his army to the Chattahoochie, General
</p>
<p>Thomas's left flank resting on it, near Price's'Ferry ; General McPherson's
</p>
<p>right at the mouth of Nickajack ; and General Schofield in the reserve,
</p>
<p>while the enemy lay behind a line of unusual strength, covering the rail
</p>
<p>road and pontoon bridges, and beyond the Chattahoochie. From the
</p>
<p>heights on the banks of this stream could be seen the forests that surround
</p>
<p>Atlanta ; the spires of the churches and public buildings that adorned the
</p>
<p>great city are distinctly visible. On the 4th, the curiosity was so great
</p>
<p>to see Atlanta, many of the soldiers straggled from their regiments and

</p>
<p>climbed the hill-sides to get a glimpse at the promised place.
</p>
<p>On the 10th, Sherman held possession of the country north and west of
</p>
<p>the river. The rebel army was intrenched on the heights overlooking
</p>
<p>the valley of Peach Tree Creek, his right beyond the Augusta road to
</p>
<p>the east, and his left well toward Turner's Ferry on the Chattahoochie ;
</p>
<p>general distance from Atlanta about four miles. The Richmond authori

</p>
<p>Hood to take command. Johnston's poUcy had been to intrench and
</p>
<p>await attack; but Hood now determined to inaugurate different tactics,
</p>
<p>that of attack, which he boldly commenced on Sherman's left wing,
</p>
<p>but every effort of the new general proved unavailing, as Sherman
</p>
<p>continued not only to advance, but to close in upon Atlanta ; his line, on
</p>
<p>July 22d, formed a. general circle of about two miles radius. Hood who
</p>
<p>had found that Sherman could not be driven back, began to occupy a
</p>
<p>line of finished redoubts which had been prepared for more than a year,
</p>
<p>covering all the roads leading into Atlanta. Sherman remarks: " We
</p>
<p>found him also busy in connecting these redoubts with curtains strength
</p>
<p>ened by rifle trenches, abatis, and chevaux-de-frise."
</p>
<p>' ' General McPherson, who had advanced from Decatur, continued to
</p>
<p>follow substantiaUy the railroad, with the Fifteenth Corps, General Lo
</p>
<p>gan; the Seventeenth, General Blair, on its left; and the Sixteenth,
</p>
<p>General Dodge, on its right ; but as the general advance of all the armies
</p>
<p>contracted the circle, the Sixteenth Corps, General Dodge, was thrown
</p>
<p>out of line by the Fifteenth connecting on the right with General Scho
</p>
<p>field near the Howard House. General McPherson, the night before,
</p>
<p>had gained a hill to the south and east of the railroad, where the Seven
</p>
<p>teenth Corps had, after a severe fight, driven the enemy, and it gave
</p>
<p>him a most commanding position, within easy view of the very heart of
</p>
<p>the city. He had thrown out working parties to it, and was making
</p>
<p>preparations to occupy it in strength with batteries. The Sixteenth
</p>
<p>Corps, General Dodge, was ordered from right to left to occupy this
</p>
<p>position and make it a strong general left flank. General Dodge was
</p>
<p>moving by a diagonal path, or wagon track, leading from the Decatur
</p>
<p>road in the direction of General Blair's left flank. General McPherson
</p>
<p>remained with me until near noon, when some reports reaching us that
</p>
<p>indicated a movement of the enemy on that flank, he mounted and rode
</p>
<p>away with his staff. I must here also state that the day before I had
</p>
<p>detached General Garrard's cavahy to go to Covington, on the Augusta
</p>
<p>road, forty-two miles east of Atlanta, and from that point to send detach
</p>
<p>ments to break the two important bridges across the YeUow and Ulco-
</p>
<p>fauhatchee Rivers, tributaries of Ocmulgee, and General McPherson had

</p>
<p>also left his wagon train at Decatur under a guard of three regime-ts,
</p>
<p>commanded by Colonel, now General Sprague. Soon after General Mc
</p>
<p>Pherson left me at the Howard House, as before described, I heard the
</p>
<p>sounds of musketry to our left rear  at first mere pattering shots, but
</p>
<p>soon they grew in volume, accompanied with artiUery, and about the
</p>
<p>same time the sound of guns was heard in the direction of Decatur. No
</p>
<p>doubt could long be entertained of the enemy's plan of action, which
</p>
<p>was to throw a superior force on our left flank, while he held us with
</p>
<p>his forts in front, the only question being as to the amount of force he
</p>
<p>214 GENERAL SHERMAN AND
</p>
<p>could employ at that point. I hastily transmitted orders to all points of
</p>
<p>our centre and right to press forward, and to give full employment to
</p>
<p>all the enemy in his lines, and for General Schofield to hold as large a
</p>
<p>force in reserve as possible, awaiting developments. Not more than
</p>
<p>half an hour after General McPherson had left me, viz., about 12) p. m.
</p>
<p>of the 22d, his adjutant-general, Lieutenant-Colonel Clark, rode up and
</p>
<p>reported that General McPherson was either dead, or a prisoner ; that he
</p>
<p>had ridden from me to General Dodge's column, moving as heretofore de
</p>
<p>scribed, and had sent off nearly all his staff and oderlies on various er
</p>
<p>rands, and himself had passed into a narrow path or road that led to the left
</p>
<p>and rear of General Giles A. Smith's division, which was General Blair's
</p>
<p>extreme left ; that a few minutes after he had entered the woods a sharp
</p>
<p>voUey was heard in that direction, and his horse had come out riderless,
</p>
<p>having two wounds. The suddenness of this terrible calamity would
</p>
<p>have overwhelmed me with grief, but the living demanded my whole
</p>
<p>thoughts. I instantly despatched a staff officer to General John A. Lo
</p>
<p>gan, commanding the Fifteenth Corps, to tell him what had happened ;
</p>
<p>that he must assume command of the Army of the Tennessee, and
</p>
<p>hold stubbornly the ground already chosen.
</p>
<p>" But among the dead was Major-General McPherson, whose body was
</p>
<p>recovered and brought to me in the heat of battle, and I had it sent, in
</p>
<p>charge of his personal staff, back to Marietta, on its way to his northern
</p>
<p>home. He was a noble youth, of striking personal appearance, of the
</p>
<p>highest professional capacity, and with a heart abounding in kindness,
</p>
<p>that drew to him the affections of all men. His sudden death devolved
</p>
<p>the command of the Army of the Tennessee on the no less brave and
</p>
<p>gaUant General Logan, who nobly sustained his reputation and that of his
</p>
<p>veteran army, and avenged the death of his comrade and commander."

<p>General Sherman in a letter (dated ih the field near Atlanta, July 30th,
</p>
<p>1864) to a Massachusetts State Agent, who had written him from
</p>
<p>Chattanooga, enquiring where in the rebel states would be the best to
</p>
<p>organize colored troops ? Sherman sarcastically advises him that it
</p>
<p>would be a waste of time and money to open rendezvous in Northern
</p>
<p>Georgia, as he has not seen an able bodied man white or black, that was

<p>depots at Macon, Georgia, and Columbus Miss. ; Salem, Montgomery, and

<p>Mobile, Alabama ; and Columbus, MilledgeviUe, and Savannah Georgia ;

<p>the above places were, at the date of Sherman writing, all under rebel

<p>" You speak of the impression going abroad that I am opposed to the
</p>
<p>organization of colored regiments. My opinions are usually very posi
</p>
<p>tive, and there is no reason why you should not know them. Though
</p>
<p>entertaining profound reverence for our Congress, I do doubt their wis
</p>
<p>dom in the passage of this law :
</p>
<p>HIS GREAT CAMPAIGNS. 215
</p>
<p>" 1st. Because civiUan agents about an army are a nuisance.
</p>
<p>" 2d. The duty of citizens to fight for their country is too sacred a one
</p>
<p>to be peddled off by buying 'up the refuse of other States.
</p>
<p>" 3d. It is unjust to the brave soldiers and volunteers who are fighting,
</p>
<p>as those who compose this army do, to place them on a par with the
</p>
<p>class of recruits you are after.
</p>
<p>" 4th. The negro is in a transition state, and is not the equal of the
</p>
<p>white man.
</p>
<p>" 5th. He is liberated from his bondage by the act of war ; and the
</p>
<p>armies in the field are entitled to all his assistance and labor and fighting
</p>
<p>in addition to the proper quotas of the States.
</p>
<p>" 6th. This bidding and bantering for recruits, white and black, has
</p>
<p>delayed the reenforcement of our armies at the times when such reen
</p>
<p>forcements would have enabled us to make our successes permanent.
</p>
<p>" 7th. The law is an experiment which, pending war, is unwise and
</p>
<p>unsafe, and has delayed the universal draft, which I firmly beheve wiU
</p>
<p>become necessary to overcome the wide-spread resistance offered us ;
</p>
<p>and I also beheve the universal draft will be wise and beneficial ; for
</p>
<p>under the providence of God it wiU separate the sheep from the goats,
</p>
<p>and demonstrate what citizens wiU fight for their country, and whatwiU
</p>
<p>only talk.
</p>
<p>" No one will infer from this that I am not a friend to the negro, as
</p>
<p>weU as the white race. I contend that the treason and rebellion of the
</p>
<p>master freed the slave, and the armies I have commanded have con
</p>
<p>ducted to safe points more negroes than those of any general officer in
</p>
<p>the army ; but I prefer negroes for pioneers, teamsters, cooks, and
</p>
<p>servants ; others gradually to experiment in the art of the soldier, begin
</p>
<p>ning with the duties of local garrisons, such as we had at Memphis,
</p>
<p>Vicksburg, Natchez, NashvUle, and Chattanooga ; but I would not draw
</p>
<p>on the poor race for too large a proportion of its active, athletic young
</p>
<p>men, for some must remain to seek new homes and provide for the old
</p>
<p>and young, the feeble and helpless. These are some of my peculiar
</p>
<p>notions, but I assure you they are shared by a large proportion of our
</p>
<p>fighting men. ' '

<p>Headley remarks : " The honesty, directness, and philanthrophy of
</p>
<p>these views, wiU command respect from those who opposed them, and

</p>
<p>General Sherman having ordered from Chattanooga four rifled-cannon,
</p>
<p>whose calibre was 4^ inches, on August 10th the work of destruction
</p>
<p>commenced. Night and day these new messengers of peace continued
</p>
<p>to throw their globes of fire into the very heart of Atlanta, kindling con-
</p>
<p>216 GENERAL SHERMAN AND
</p>
<p>flagration on every side. This was the strongest position that could bo
</p>
<p>found: tb impede and check Sherman's, march to the sea. Johnston was
</p>
<p>considered unequal to the task of its defence. Thus Hood, being fool
</p>
<p>hardy, and reckless of human life, was chosen to command.
</p>
<p>General Stoneman, having gone on a cavalry raid to tear up the Macon
</p>
<p>railroad, being suddenly captured, the rebel General Wheeler appeared
</p>
<p>before Dalton. Approaching the town which was being, held by a garri
</p>
<p>son of 400 men under Colonel Seibold, Wheeler demanded its surrender,
</p>
<p>which was refused : Seibold alleging he was placed there to hold, and
</p>
<p>not to surrer.der the place. General Steadman arrived with sufficient
</p>
<p>force from Chattanooga in time to prevent the little garrison from being
</p>
<p>captured, and the rebels were forced to retreat.
</p>
<p>Sherman now gave orders that the sick and all surplus- wagons and en
</p>
<p>cumbrances of every kind should be sent back to the intrenched position
</p>
<p>near the river Bridge. This reduced the number of wagons to 3000, and
</p>
<p>ambulances to 1000 ; and on the night of August 25th the army of the
</p>
<p>Tennessee moved to the West Point railroad with orders to spend one day
</p>
<p>in destroying it. General Howard moved on to the right towards ,Jones-
</p>
<p>boro. General Thomas had the centre, whose goal was Conch's, on the
</p>
<p>Decator and Fayettville road. General Schofield had the extreme left.
</p>
<p>General Hood observing Sherman sending his long wagon train to the
</p>
<p>rear, thought it an indication of a retreat, and began to grow merry. By
</p>
<p>this strategy Sherman divided the rebel forces at Jonesboro and Atlanta,
</p>
<p>placing the Union army like a wedge between them.
</p>
<p>" During the night of the 28th, the rest of the army being well under
</p>
<p>way, the Twenty-Third Corps withdrew and followed the general move
</p>
<p>ment toward the Macon road ; General Schofield timing his movements.
</p>
<p>with the corps further on the left, which had the longer arc of the circle to
</p>
<p>traverse. The general line of march for the Twenty-Third corps was
</p>
<p>toward the junction of the two railroads at East Point, the Third division,
</p>
<p>under General Cox, holding the advance, and with the Second Division,
</p>
<p>' under General HascaU, occasionaUy erecting temporary works to guard
</p>
<p>against threatened attacks from the enemy, who were on the alert against
</p>
<p>this demonstration. On the 31st, these two divisions effected a junction

<p>HIS GREAT CAMPAIGNS. 217
</p>
<p>September, Newton's and KimbaU's divisions were marching along the
</p>
<p>line of the railroad the length of a brigade front, and at a given signal
</p>
<p>the ties and rails were lifted from their bed, piled up and burnt. Thus
</p>
<p>a mUe and a half was turned up and destroyed in half an hour. An ad
</p>
<p>vance of another mUe and a half was then made down the road, and the
</p>
<p>operation repeated. Thus alternately marching and destroying the road,
</p>
<p>the two divisions marched a distance of ten miles, to within two miles of
</p>
<p>Jonesboro', where they formed a junction with the Fourteenth Corps.
</p>
<p>Soon after the Twenty- third corps, which followed the Fom-th, came into
</p>
<p>position on its left. Further to the left was the army of Tennessee.
</p>
<p>" Previous to this the enemy had discovered the direction of General
</p>
<p>Sherman's march, and two corps under Hardee had been sent to confront
</p>
<p>him at Jonesboro', Hood meanwhile remaining for the defence of Atlanta.
</p>
<p>During the night of August 30th the march of a rebel column was heard
</p>
<p>on our left and centre, and in the morning two corps were found massed
</p>
<p>on our right. At daybreak, the Second brigade of Hazen's division of
</p>
<p>the Fifteenth Corps advanced, and drove the enemy from a hill, which
</p>
<p>.gave our artiUery command at Jonesboro', and the railroad less than one
</p>
<p>half mile distant This success was immediately foUowed up by the re
</p>
<p>enforcement of the brigade holding thehiU, by a brigade from Osterhaus'
</p>
<p>division. Toward three P.M. the enemy appeared in front of Hazen's
</p>
<p>position, Lee's corps advancing to the assault through a field of corn,
</p>
<p>whUe Hardee's Corps attempted.a flanking movement on the right, which
</p>
<p>was checked by Harrow's division. Both divisions were soon engaged in
</p>
<p>checking the desperate and determined assault with which the enemy
</p>
<p>sought to overwhelm them. The rebels were driven back, only to rally
</p>
<p>again and again for the assault, until after two hours of desperate fighting
</p>
<p>they were finally repulsed. They had fortunately struck a position which
</p>
<p>we held too strongly to be easily dislodged. A reenforcement of two regi
</p>
<p>ments was sent during the attack, by General Howard to General Wood,
</p>
<p>and a brigade of the Seventeenth corps, Colonel Bryant's, to General
</p>
<p>Hazen. Failing in this assault, Cleburne's rebel division marched to our
</p>
<p>extreme right, and assaulted Kilpatrick, who held the bridge on Flint
</p>
<p>River. General Kilpatrick succeeded, however, in holding his position

<p>until reheved by General GUes B. Smith's division.
</p>
<p>" During the night Hardee despatched Lee's corps to look after the
</p>
<p>safety of Atlanta, so that but a single rebel corps was found opposed to
</p>
<p>our army on the morning of September 1st. This corps lay in position
</p>
<p>in front of Jonesboro', with their right resting on the railroad. Having
</p>
<p>failed in the assault with which they hoped to drive back our army, they
</p>
<p>were prepared to resist its further advance in the best position they
</p>
<p>could secure. They had a large number of guns in position, which did
</p>
<p>effective service during the day. Late in the afternoon General Davis
</p>
<p>218 GENERAL SHERMAN AND
</p>
<p>formed his troops for a charge upon the enemy's position ; Brigadier
</p>
<p>General Carlin's division on the left, and Brigadier General Morgan, join
</p>
<p>ing Fifteenth Corps on the right, General Baird beiDg in reserve. The
</p>
<p>Une was formed in the arc of a circle on the edge of the woods, the two
</p>
<p>flanks thrown forward overlapping the enemy, who held a position on
</p>
<p>some commanding ridges in front, covering Jonesboro'. In the face of
</p>
<p>a deadly fire of musketry, shell, and canister, the gallant Fourteenth
</p>
<p>Corps charged the rebel position, driving them from their breastworks
</p>
<p>and capturing many prisoners, including Brigadier General Govan, sev
</p>
<p>eral colonels and other commissioned officers. Eight guns were also
</p>
<p>taken, among them part of Loomis's battery captured at Chickamauga.
</p>
<p>The troops captured belonged to tha fighting division of Cleburne. The
</p>
<p>approach of night prevented pursuit of the broken columns of the rebels,
</p>
<p>who escaped under cover of the darkness. t
</p>
<p>" At daybreak on the 2d, the Fourth and Twenty-third Corps advanced
</p>
<p>in pursuit of the retreating rebels, who came to bay near Lovejoy's Sta
</p>
<p>tion, six miles beyond Jonesboro', toward Macon, taking position on a
</p>
<p>wooded ridge behind a swamp bordering a creek. Some skirmishing
</p>
<p>was had with the enemy's first line until night  which was spent by our
</p>
<p>troops in intrenching. The enemy being found in strong position, and
</p>
<p>his retreat being assured, no further advance was attempted.
</p>
<p>" Meatime Atlanta was alive with excitement. Despair had succeeded
</p>
<p>confidence as it became known that Hardee had been driven from Jones
</p>
<p>boro' south, while Hood was left in Atlanta with his communications
</p>
<p>severed, and our army threatening both from the north and the south.
</p>
<p>Early on Thursday, September 1st, the removal of supplies and ammuni
</p>
<p>tion commenced, and was continued through the day. Large quantities
</p>
<p>of provisions that could not be removed were distributed to the citizens;
</p>
<p>the storehouses at the same time being thrown open to the troops as
</p>
<p>they passed through the city. The rolling stock of the railroad, consist
</p>
<p>ing of about one hundred cars, and six engines, was gathered together
</p>
<p>and destroyed. The cars were laden with the surplus ammunition taken
</p>
<p>out on the Augusta Railroad, and set on fire and blown up, making the
</p>
<p>earth tremble with the explosion. Over one thousand bales of cotton

</p>
<p>were also given to the torch. The scene of confusion and excitement
</p>
<p>among the town people when it became evident that the city was to be
</p>
<p>evacuated, is beyond description. Every possible and impossible vehi
</p>
<p>cle was brought into requisition to carry away the effects of the inhabi
</p>
<p>tants, who, in sorrowful procession, took up their line of march toward
</p>
<p>the South. For the third time the peripatetic Memphis Appeal was on
</p>
<p>the wing, its editor reporting himself at this time ' thoroughly demor
</p>
<p>alized. ' From the shanties and cellars of the city swarmed out the lower
</p>
<p>classes of the population to seize what they could fr jm the general wreck.
</p>
<p>HIS GREAT CAMPAIGNS. 219
</p>
<p>The explosion of ammunition was heard by General Slocum, of the Twen
</p>
<p>tieth Corps, seven miles distant. Suspecting the cause, he sent out a
</p>
<p>heavy column to reconnoitre at daybreak on the morning of the 2d in
</p>
<p>stant. They met with no opposition, and pushed forward on the roads
</p>
<p>leading into Atlanta from the north and northwest. Arriving near the
</p>
<p>city, they were met by the mayor, Mr. Calhoun, who formally surren
</p>
<p>dered the city. The formalities disposed of, our troops entered Atlanta
</p>
<p>with banners flying and music playing, the inhabitants looking on in si
</p>
<p>lence. General Slocum established his headquarters at the Trout House,
</p>
<p>the principal hotel of the city. Eleven heavy guns, mostly sixty-six
</p>
<p>pounders, were found in the forts of the city, and others were subse
</p>
<p>quently discovered buried in fictitious graves. About three thousand
</p>
<p>muskets, in good order, and three locomotives were also secured, besides
</p>
<p>large quantities of manufactured tobacco. About two hundred rebel
</p>
<p>stragglers were gathered up by the Second Massachusetts, which was
</p>
<p>detailed for provost duty, its colonel, Coggswell, being appointed pro
</p>
<p>vost marshal. But a small proportion of the inhabitants remained in the
</p>
<p>city, and these principaUy of the lower classes, and tradesmen who pro
</p>
<p>posed to make an honest penny out of the army. Their hopes were
</p>
<p>speedily cut short by a peremptory order from General Sherman ordering
</p>
<p>all civilians from the city. ' '
</p>
<p>In looking back upon this campaign, a very remarkable feature of it
</p>
<p>was the protection of his line of communication : " It was not a little pre
</p>
<p>carious, and more than once aroused the anxiety of the nation. It might
</p>
<p>well occasion solicitude. His base was, in one sense, not at Chattanooga,
</p>
<p>but at Nashville ; with the former point as a secondary base. Accord.
</p>
<p>ingly, the enemy bent his efforts not only to breaking the railroad between
</p>
<p>Atlanta and Ringgold, striking it at Dalton and Calhoun, but also to raiding
</p>
<p>on the road from Chattanooga back to Nashville. From Atlanta to Chat-
</p>

</p>
<p>Chattanooga to Nashville only a little less. With this line of two hun

<p>" On the 1st of May our armies were lying in garrison, seemingly quiet
</p>
<p>from Knoxville to Huntsville, and our enemy lay behind his rocky- faced
</p>
<p>barrier at Dalton, proud, defiant, and exulting. He had had time since
</p>
<p>Christmas to recover from his discomfiture on the Mission Ridge, with
</p>
<p>his ranks filled, and a new commander-in-chief, second to none of the

<p>Confederacy in reputation for skill, sagacity, and extreme popularity.
</p>
<p>AU at once our armies assumed life and action, and appeared before Dal
</p>
<p>ton ; threatening Rockey Face we threw ourselves upon Resaca, and the
</p>
<p>rebel army only escaped by the rapidity of its retreat, aided by the nu
</p>
<p>merous roads with which he was familiar, and which were strange to us.
</p>
<p>Again he took position in Allatooha, but we gave him no rest, and by a
</p>
<p>circuit toward Dallas and subsequent movement to Ackworth, we gained
</p>
<p>the AUatoona Pass. Then followed the eventful battles about Kenesaw,
</p>
<p>and the escape of the enemy across Chattahoochie River.
</p>
<p>" The crossing of the Chattahoochie and breaking of the Augusta road
</p>
<p>was most handsomely executed by us, and wiU be studied as anexample
</p>
<p>in the art of war. At this stage of our game our enemies became dissat
</p>
<p>isfied with their old and skilful commander, and selected one more bold
</p>
<p>and rash. New tactics were adopted. Hood first boldly and rapidly, onthe
</p>
<p>20th of July, fell on our right at Peach Tree Creek, and lost. Again, on
</p>
<p>the 22d, he struck our extreme left, and was severely punished ; and fi
</p>
<p>nally, again on the 28th he repeated the attempt on our right, and that
</p>
<p>time must have been satisfied ; for since that date he has remained on
</p>
<p>the defensive. We slowly and graduaUy' drew our lines about Atlanta,
</p>
<p>feeling for the railroads which suppUed the rebel army, and made Atlanta
</p>
<p>a place of importance. We must, concede to our enemy that he met
</p>
<p>these efforts patiently and skilfully, but at last he made the mistake we
</p>
<p>had waited for so long, and sent his cavalry to our rear, far beyond the
</p>
<p>reach of recall. Instantly our cavalry was on his only remaining road,
</p>
<p>and we followed quickly with our principal army, and Atlanta fell into
</p>
<p>our possession as the fruit of well-concerted measures, backed by a brave
</p>
<p>and confident army. This completed the grand task which had been as

<p>signed us by our Government, and your general again repeats his per

<p>sonal and official thanks to aU the officers and men composing this army,
</p>
<p>for the indomitable courage and perseverance which alone could give

<p>success. " We have beaten our enemy on every ground he has chosen, and have

<p>wrested from him his own Gate City, where were located his foun

<p>is already greeting you from the Government and people, in view of the

<p>" My first intimate acquaintance with you datea from the 28th of July.
</p>
<p>I never beheld fiercer assaults than the enemy then made, and I never

<p>saw troops more steady and self-possessed in action than your divisions

<p>" Official: Samuel L. Taggart, A.-A.-G." t
</p>
<p>Necessity, as Sherman paced the piazza of that house in Atlanta, utterly
</p>
<p>abstracted 'in thought, brought out the genius of the man. To him be
</p>
<p>longs the credit, not only of the execution, but the conception of his great
</p>
<p>and triumphal journey to the coast. He gave a synopsis of his plans to
</p>
<p>Lieutenant-General Grant and the War department, and they sanctioned
</p>
<p>the enterprise. Being largely reinforced by the draft he sent the
</p>
<p>4th and 23d corps to General Thomas, in whose hands he had entrusted
</p>
<p>the Chattanooga and Nashville line, as a nucleus of a new army ; his ob
</p>
<p>ject was to leave a sufficient force under an able commander to take
</p>
<p>charge of Hood, who had for months been hovering around Atlanta with
</p>
<p>a view of cutting off Sherman's supplies, and was now preparing to
</p>
<p>advance on Nashville. Of this last movement General Sherman was
</p>
<p>accurately informed. From Dalton, Hood with his army moved to Gaines
</p>
<p>ville, thence to Gadsden, from which point his advance on NashviUe
</p>
<p>commenced. At length the great time for action came. Sherman divided
</p>
<p>his army into two wings. The right wing, 15th and 17th corps, under
</p>
<p>the command of Major General 0. 0. Howard : the left wing, l'4th and
</p>
<p>20th corps, under Major General H. W. Slocum, while Brigadier General
</p>
<p>Kilpatrick, commander of the cavalry, was to receive special orders from
</p>
<p>the Commander and chief.
</p>
<p>On the 9th of November, 1864, General Sherman, at his head-quarters
</p>
<p>in Kingston, Georgia, issued his orders for the march through that
</p>
<p>State to the sea. At Centerville he severed his connection with the

<p>North ; his last communication over the wires, to General Thomas,
</p>
<p>November 13, was, All is weU. The rebels supposing Atlanta evac
</p>
<p>uated on the 11th, rushed up to take possession, and over nine hundred
</p>
<p>of them were captured. On the ever-memorable night of the 15th of
</p>
<p>November, 1864, the remaining part of the city of Atlanta was fired  and
</p>
<p>during the conflagration the whole heavens were illuminated, the sight

<p>being grand beyond description. A brigade of Massachustett's sol

<p>224 GENERAL SHERMAN AND
</p>
<p>playing, John Brown's soul goes marching on. On the morning of the
</p>
<p>16th, General Sherman with his brave army, with only sixteen days
</p>
<p>rations, started for Savannah. Hood supposing the way was now clear,
</p>
<p>started for Nashville. Just fourteen days after Sherman left Atlanta a
</p>
<p>battle took place at Franklin, Tennessee, between Thomas and Hood.
</p>
<p>The latter lost 6,000 killed and wounded, and 1,000 prisoners, and thirty
</p>
<p>stand of colors. Manoeuvering and skirmishing was kept up until the
</p>
<p>15th of December, when General Thomas secured a better position,
</p>
<p>his left resting on Murfreesboro, and his main body a few miles from
</p>
<p>Nashville. While in this position the fight commenced and lasted about nine hours,
</p>
<p>resulting in a great Union victory. Hood's army abandoned artiUery,
</p>
<p>woundei men, and the road was strewn for miles with trophies of war
</p>
<p>thrown away by the panic-stricken rebels in their flight. This great de
</p>
<p>feat completely destroyed Hood's army ; his loss being over 12,000
</p>
<p>men, and fifty pieces of artillery, and its commander was never again
</p>
<p>able to rally his forces to any advantage. The Union loss in the engage
</p>
<p>ment was about 3,000 men.
</p>
<p>Sherman's army was stretched out over a swath of country about sixty
</p>
<p>miles wide, destroying the Atlanta and Augusta railroad ; also the road
</p>
<p>" to Macon. Railways, cotton mills, machine shops and founderies were
</p>
<p>everywhere destroyed ; every means "of making or repairing railroads
</p>
<p>south of Virginia and the Carolines were destroyed. Lee could not de
</p>
<p>pend on the South for supplies ; they had not even the means left to
</p>
<p>build up what Sherman was tearing down and destroying. The Georgia
</p>
<p>,militia who had been sent to aid General Hood was recalled by Governor
</p>
<p>Brown, and a show of resistance now began to appear. Some of these
</p>
<p>troops had been recalled from Alabama, after a march of near five
</p>
<p>hundred miles.
</p>
<p>But the army moved on without hindrance, through Covington, Decatur,
</p>
<p>Madison, Jackson, and Eatonton. Approaching Milledgeville, in a swamp
</p>
<p>was found Howell Cobb's celebrated pacing mare, which cost him $25,000.
</p>
<p>This animal was found by private Walter Burns, Company E, Twenty-
</p>
<p>first Ohio, who a few days afterwards was captured and murdered
</p>
<p>while riding her. He was acting as orderly, and when his companions

<p>dug up his grave they found his throat cut after he had been shot
</p>
<p>through the head. At twelve o'clock*, noon, November 22, the army
</p>
<p>entered Milledgeville. The national colors were hoisted over the state
</p>
<p>house by the 104th New York Regiment. Governor Brown and the rebel
</p>
<p>Legislature were in session the day before, but fled to Augusta, guarded
</p>
<p>by about one thousand rebel cavalry. The Union boys had quite a frolic,
</p>
<p>holding a mock rebel legislature in the state house. After it was organ
</p>
<p>ized the question of reconstructing the state was discussed by the yankee

</p>
<p>members from the different counties with all the gravity conceivable.
</p>
<p>A few miles from this, at Griswoldsville, a fight took place ; the enemy
</p>
<p>about 5,000 strong, composed chiefly of militia, was sent out to prevent
</p>
<p>a raid on Macon ; the result was a loss to the rebels of 2,500 in killed,
</p>
<p>wounded and prisoners ; Union loss, about 40 killed and wounded.
</p>
<p>Over ten thousand contrabands were now foUowing the Union army, and
</p>
<p>its own safety and convenience required that the great exodus should be
</p>
<p>checked. At Ogeechee River for this purpose a guard was placed at the
</p>
<p>pontoon bridge which kept the blacks from passing until the troops got
</p>
<p>over, when the bridge was removed and the caravan left on the other side.
</p>
<p>The negroes would notbe checked, but built a foot bridge next day when
</p>
<p>they aU passed over and followed the army. At Ebenezer Creek the same
</p>
<p>means were resorted to, to prevent the blacks encumbering the army,
</p>
<p>which did not know what moment it might be attacked. Wheeler came
</p>
<p>up in the rear with his rebel cavalry, and finding this great army of con
</p>
<p>trabands trying to cross the stream, charged on the defenceless beings,
</p>
<p>drove them into the stream amidst shrieks of despair. Mothers clasped
</p>
<p>their infants and sank down in their watery grave. Thousands of these
</p>
<p>poor creatures perished in the stream into which they had been driven
</p>
<p>by the hellish monster, while he and his cut-throat cavalry companions
</p>
<p>sat on their horses on the river bank, shouting and laughing at the pain
</p>
<p>ful sight This was about forty miles from the coast. Kilpatrick and
</p>
<p>Davis had until now, been a shield to the real movements of the army ;
</p>
<p>it was impossible for the rebel commander Beauregard to determine
</p>
<p>whether it was at Millen, Augusta, Charleston or Savannah, that
</p>
<p>Sherman was about to strike.
</p>
<p>On the 11th and 12th of December, General Sherman began to draw
</p>
<p>the Unes around Savannah. On the 12th, Slocum's left rested three mUes
</p>
<p>from the city to beyond the Gulf railway, when Howard's right rested
</p>
<p>eleven miles from the city. His corps had just completed the destruc
</p>
<p>tion of the last link of railway centering in the city. In the meantime
</p>
<p>Kilpatrick moved down to St. Catharine Sound to open communication
</p>
<p>with the fleet. He wanted to storm Fort McAllister with the cavalry ;,
</p>
<p>but the General-in-Chief thought it might be hazardous, and would not

<p>consent. It was afterwards carried by Hazen. General Sherman viewed
</p>
<p>the conflict from the roof of Dr. Cheroe's rice mill on the Ogeechee,
</p>
<p>opposite the Fort. Standing on this elevated position he looked through
</p>
<p>his glass out on the horizon, seaward. Discovering smoke, he remarked
</p>
<p>to General Howard, " There is a gunboat." Half an hour passed, ancl
</p>
<p>the guns of the Fort now opened, which indicated that Hazen had sent.
</p>
<p>bis skirmishers forward. Hazen now signalled that he had invested the=
</p>
<p>fort and would assault immediately. 15 ]
</p>
<p>226 GENERAL SHERMAN AND
</p>
<p>The gunboats now approaching, threw up signals informing Sherman
</p>
<p>that Foster and Dahlgren were close by.
</p>
<p>The distance of Sherman from the fort was about three miles. SteadUy
</p>
<p>through his glass did he watch every movement, " There they go grad-
</p>
<p>uaUy ; not a waver." Half a moment more he exclaims : " How steadily
</p>
<p>it moves ; not a man falters. There they go, stiU. See the roU of mus
</p>
<p>ketry. Grand! Grand!"
</p>
<p>Still using his glass, he remarks, " That flag still goes forward. There
</p>
<p>is no flinching there."
</p>
<p>Steadily gazing, ' ' look, ' ' he says, ' ' It has halted ! They waver  np, it's
</p>
<p>the parapet. There they go again  Now they scale it  Some are over.
</p>
<p>Look ! there's the flag on the works. Another !  another ! Its ours ! 
</p>
<p>the Fort is ours I"
</p>
<p>He dropped his glass by his side. His joy was complete. The vic
</p>
<p>tory won !  remarking, " Dis chile don't sleep dis night."
</p>
<p>At sunset, December 13th, the dark waters of the Ogeechee, bearing
</p>
<p>witness, will ever be remembered as the time General Sherman changed
</p>
<p>his base from Atlanta to the sea. By his triumph he fulfilled the covenant
</p>
<p>made with his heroes at Atlanta twenty days before. He had carried
</p>
<p>through the enterprise ! . His achievement was complete. Only 23 were
</p>
<p>killed, and 82 wounded in capturing the fort. The rebels had 14 killed
</p>
<p>and 21 wounded. Well might Sherman, Howard, and Hazen be proud of
</p>
<p>the old Second Division. Under Logan, in the past, it had won unfading
</p>
<p>laurels, and under Hazen it capped the climax of its glory. From Atlanta
</p>
<p>the army passed over 42 of the finest grain growing counties in Georgia ;
</p>
<p>captured over 200 towns and villages ; brought out about 15,000 slaves :
</p>
<p>mearly the same number of horses and mules ; destroyed 240 miles of
</p>
<p>a-ailroad ; burned aU the bridges and cotton-gins ; all public buildings of
</p>
<p>seryice to the enemy ; burned or bonded over $40,000,000 worth of cot
</p>
<p>ton ; any amount of rebel scrip and money ; some gold and silver ; 30
</p>
<p>pieces of cannon, stores, and railroad trains, sufficient cattle to supply
</p>
<p>the army with fresh meat, and 4000 prisoners. Distance about 300 miles.

<p>had here an interview with Secretary Stanton, who, after an entire
</p>
<p>night's conversation, remarked, they understood the question as well as
</p>
<p>any of the Cabinet.
</p>
<p>When I think of the universal testimony of the escaped soldiers who
</p>
<p>daily entered the Union lines, stating that in hundreds of miles which
</p>
<p>they traversed on their way, they never asked the poor slave in vain for
</p>
<p>help ; that the poorest negroes hid, sheltered, and shared their last

<p>crumb with them.
</p>
<p>How ungrateful would it be for the country to turn its back on such
</p>
<p>devoted friends !
</p>
<p>Sherman's march into, and through south Carolina.
</p>
<p>After his capture of Savannah, the last few days of December, and the
</p>
<p>first part of January, 1865, was spent by Sherman in recruiting his army
</p>
<p>from its long march through Georgia. The army was not only rested, but
</p>
<p>reenforced, having a greater number of effective men than when it started
</p>
<p>from Atlanta in November last. The organization was the same : Major
</p>
<p>General 0. 0. Howard led the right wing, and Major General H. W. Slo
</p>
<p>cum led the left wing, Major General Kilpatrick under, and reporting only
</p>
<p>to General Sherman himself.
</p>
<p>On January 16th, he moved the 17th and two divisions of the 15th
</p>
<p>Corps by water to Beaufort, and on the 20th the left wing, marching on
</p>
<p>either side of the Savannah river towards Augusta.
</p>
<p>On the 23d Sherman transferred his headquarters from Savannah to Beau
</p>
<p>fort. The left wing was delayed by rains in camp, seven miles from Sa
</p>
<p>vannah, until the 25th ; it reached Springfield the day after, and Sister's
</p>
<p>Ferry on the 27th. The right wing moved from Pocotaligo towards the
</p>
<p>Cambahee river on the 29th. The left wing was unable to leave Sister's
</p>
<p>Ferry on account of the high water.
</p>
<p>On the 30th the right wing moved along the Savannah and Charleston
</p>
<p>railroad, encountering rebel cavalry, until the 31st, when it arrived at
</p>
<p>McPhersonville, leaving the left still at Sister's Ferry, This was the
</p>
<p>situation of the army on thtHast day of January,
</p>
<p>On the 1st day of February, the right moved from McPhersonville to

<p>came impatient at the slow advance of the left wing, which was now over
</p>
<p>20 miles behind.
</p>
<p>On the 3d, the right wing moved from Brighton's Bridge across the
</p>
<p>Salkahatchie ; the enemy's cavahy made some resistance to the crossing,
</p>
<p>by burning the bridge, and skirmishing with the advance, but was driven
</p>
<p>away, and on the 4th, the entire right crossed the stream. On the same
</p>
<p>day the left, which had been water-bound at Sister's Ferry since the 27th
</p>
<p>of January, was enabled to cross the S ivannah river.
</p>
<p>228 GENERAL SHERMAN AND
</p>
<p>On the 5th, the right crossed Whippy Swamp, while the left came
</p>
<p>up to Brighton. The'next day the right wing, encountered and fought
</p>
<p>the rebel cavalry under Wheeler at Orange Court House, on the Little
</p>
<p>Salkahatchie, while on the 7th, it reached Bamburg and Medway, on the
</p>
<p>Charleston and Augusta railroad. The same day the left wing moved to
</p>
<p>Lawtonville, which place was burned by the 20th corps.
</p>
<p>On the 8th, the right crossed the South Edisto, and reached Grahams-
</p>
<p>ville on the 9th. On the same day the left wing reached Allendale.
</p>
<p>On the 10th the right wing crossed the North Edisto river, and the left
</p>
<p>reached Fiddle Pond near Barnwell. The right wing captured Orange
</p>
<p>burg on the 11th, and the left marched through Barnwell on the same
</p>
<p>day, leaving the town in ashes, and encamped three mUes from White
</p>
<p>Pond Station.
</p>
<p>On the 12th, the right wing left Orangeburg and made for the Congaree
</p>
<p>and Columbia, while the left tore up ten miles of the Charleston and Au
</p>
<p>gusta railroad. Orangeburg was set on fire by a Jew who had lost
</p>
<p>50 bales of cotton by a body of rebels  he did it out of revenge. The
</p>
<p>soldiers tried to extinguish the flames, but could not on account of the
</p>
<p>high wind prevailing at the time.
</p>
<p>On the 13th, the left crossed the South Edisto, and the day foUowing
</p>
<p>passed the North Edisto river.
</p>
<p>On the 15th, the right wing effected the passage of the Congaree, and
</p>
<p>began sheUing Columbia, the Capital of South Carolina. General Carlin,
</p>
<p>who was in advance of the left wing, had a skirmish with the rebels near
</p>
<p>Lexington, capturing and burning the town. While the right wing con
</p>
<p>fronted Columbia, the left marched to Hart's Ferry on the Seluda river.
</p>
<p>three miles above the city. Beauregard, the rebel general, to whose skill
</p>
<p>and bravery the defence of the city had been entrusted, had placed troops
</p>
<p>in the woods beyond the river to prevent the Union army from crossing,
</p>
<p>but they were driven out by the left wing.
</p>
<p>On the 17th, Generals Sherman and Howard at the head of the right
</p>
<p>wing were the first to cross the bridge and enter Columbia. This was
</p>
<p>to have been the next rebel Capital after Lee evacuated Richmond.

</p>
<p>We will welcome to our numbers the boys all true and brave,
</p>
<p>Shouting the battle-cry of Freedom !
</p>
<p>And although he may be poor, he shall never be a slave,
</p>
<p>Shouting the battle-cry of Freedom !
</p>
<p>Chorus  The Union for ever ! <fcc.
</p>
<p>So we're springing to the call from the East and from the West,
</p>
<p>Shouting the battle-cry of Freedom !
</p>
<p>And we'll hurl the rebel crew from the land we love the best,
</p>
<p>Shouting the battle-cry of Freedom !
</p>
<p>Chorus  The Union for everl &c
</p>
<p>The white male part of the inhabitants were mostly indifferent ; but
</p>
<p>the blacks^men, women, and children, all shouted and danced with joy.
</p>
<p>" ' Thank de Lord, Mr. Sherman hab come at last. We prayed, and de
</p>
<p>Lord Jesus answered our prayers."
</p>
<p>One fat old woman said to him, while shaking him by the hand, which
</p>
<p>he always gladly gave to these poor people, " I prayed dis long time for
</p>
<p>yer, and de blessing ob de Lord is on yer. But yesterday afternoon,
</p>
<p>when yer stopped trowing de sheUs into de town, and de soldiers run

</p>
<p>Here could be seen slavery in its worst form. The Union army aU bore
</p>
<p>witness that a studied effort has long been made by the heartless masters
</p>
<p>residing around this treasonable place, to reduce the negro to the level of
</p>
<p>the brute. And the vengeance of Almighty God was kept in store for
</p>
<p>this shameless crime. Old Glory (as the Union soldiers call the flag) was

<p>army. Columbia was a beautiful place before the war. The new capitol build
</p>
<p>ing is as fine as any in the States. Brown, the sculptor, at great personal
</p>
<p>expense, partially completed groups of statuary for which he has received
</p>
<p>no pay, and they remain stowed away in the surrounding buddings. By
</p>
<p>order of Wade Hampton the rebels had placed thousands of bales of
</p>
<p>cotton in the main streets of the city, and when evacuating the place set
</p>
<p>it on fire. Before any of the public buildings had been fired by Sherman's
</p>
<p>men, a high wind arose, and the smouldering embers from tho burning
</p>
<p>cotton was carried into all parts of the city, and on the night of the 17th th
</p>
<p>230 GENERAL SHERMAN AND
</p>
<p>whole town was illuminated by its destruction. The arsenal, railroad
</p>
<p>depots, storehouses, magazines, public property, private residences of
</p>
<p>the aristocracy, together with the business part of the city, and twenty
</p>
<p>thousand bales of cotton were destroyed. The new State house was not
</p>
<p>burned, but the old one was. Not a rail upon any of the roads within
</p>
<p>twenty miles of Columbia but what was twisted into corkscrews, while
</p>
<p>on two of them the good work was continued to their terminus. Forty-
</p>
<p>five pieces of artillery were captured, fifteen locomotives, and an immense
</p>
<p>amount of cotton and government stores.
</p>
<p>FLOGGING A MAN-HUNTEE.
</p>
<p>Some of the men, escorted by negroes and escaped prisoner*, paid a
</p>
<p>visit to a noted ruffian, a second Legree, who kept a pack of bloodhounds
</p>
<p>for the purpose of hunting down niggers and escaped Union prisoners.
</p>
<p>The boys disposed of his dogs as they have done with all the bloodhounds
</p>
<p>they came across, burned down his house and place, then tied him to
</p>
<p>a tree and got some strapping niggers to flog him, which they did with
</p>
<p>a wiU, repaying in the lex talionis style.
</p>
<p>These blackhearted traitors, who for forty years have been taunting the
</p>
<p>North and defying the federal government, never dreamed that vengeance
</p>
<p>would penetrate their treasonable dens. But how mortifying it must have
</p>
<p>been for this slave oligarchy to witness, the feet of one hundred thousand
</p>
<p>abohtionists, hated and despised, press heavily on their soil. Thou
</p>
<p>sands of the best blood of the State were off in the rebel army, and those
</p>
<p>that remained were left withouthomes. The Hamptons, Barnwells, Simses,
</p>
<p>Rhetts, Singletons, Prestons, and the rest had no resting-places. The
</p>
<p>ancient homesteads, the heritages of many generations, where were
</p>
<p>gathered the family ties and sacred associations of over two hundred
</p>
<p>years, were for ever gone. When they became traitors their honor fled ;
</p>
<p>now they have no local habitations, and in the glorious future of this
</p>
<p>great country they wiU have a traitor's name.
</p>
<p>The right wing camped at Columbia, while the left was in camp on
</p>
<p>Broad river. On the 19th, it crossed the river, destroyed GreenviUe, and
</p>
<p>Columbia railroad, stopping at Alston. On the 20th, the right wing left

<p>the left crossed the Little river. The whole army was concentrated at
</p>
<p>Winnsboro on the 21st. This led the rebel general Johnston to suppose
</p>
<p>that Sherman intended to push on Charlotte. On the 22d, the right wing
</p>
<p>crossed the Wateree river at Pay's Ferry, while the left tore up the railroad
</p>
<p>above Winnsboro, and moved to Youngsville. On 23d, the right wing rested
</p>
<p>on Lynch Creek, while the left rested at Rocky Mount, Catawba river. On
</p>
<p>the 23d it crossed the river, while on the 25th, the right wing captured Cam-

</p>
<p>den. On the 27th, while General Carlin was endeavoring to cross the Ca
</p>
<p>tawba, the rebel general, Wheeler, with his cavalry disputed the passage.
</p>
<p>The right wing now on the 28th moved from Camden towards Cheraw, and
</p>
<p>for three days encamped on Lynch Creek, waiting for the left wing to thrash
</p>
<p>Wheeler, and cross over the Catawba river and come up.
</p>
<p>GENERAL DESCRIPTION AND APPEARANCE OF OAEOLINA.
</p>
<p>The Sea islands of South Carolina extend along the coast from Winyaw
</p>
<p>bay to the Savannah river, and are composed of a rich vegetable loam of
</p>
<p>great fertility, producing sea island cotton, corn and rice. The orange tree
</p>
<p>and palmetto flourish among these islands. The tide flows a considerable
</p>
<p>way inland along the rivers, irrigating the immense extent of marsh land
</p>
<p>that borders them. These lands, though unhealthy, are very valuable as
</p>
<p>rice plantations.
</p>
<p>The region between the tide swamps, and the sand hills of the middle
</p>
<p>country extends for nearly one hundred miles.
</p>
<p>The river swamps here, too, are immense, extending in some places six
</p>
<p>miles in width, and are unfit for cultivation, but afford a safe resort for water
</p>
<p>fowls, reptiles, and alligators. Across these dismal swamps our armies had
</p>
<p>?o force their passage. Beyond these the sand-hill region extends for some
</p>
<p>thirty miles towards Columbia, and includes the extremes of sterility and
</p>
<p>fertility. The high, poor lands are covered with pitch pine, black jacks or
</p>
<p>dwarf oaks, while the lowlands bordering the rivers produce corn, cotton,
</p>
<p>and rice in abundance.
</p>
<p>The country extending from the sand-hill region to the mountains  some
</p>
<p>ninety miles possesses a pTetty uniform character. The surface is clay,
</p>
<p>covered for the most part with a rich soil, mixed with sand or granite. The
</p>
<p>rolling nature of this tract of countiy gives it rather a picturesque appear
</p>
<p>ance. This tract extends along the Broad river, in York and Spartansburg
</p>
<p>districts. The mountainous country is confined to Pendleton and Greenville
</p>
<p>districts, and though the soil is rather sterUe, the country is pleasant and
</p>
<p>taealtiry. On March 1st, the left wing moved on to Hanging Rock, and the next day
</p>
<p>marched to Horton's Ferry, and on the 3d the entire army crossed Lynch
</p>
<p>Creek. On the 4th, the right wing captured Cheraw, Here were found many
</p>
<p>guns and a large quantity of ammunition which had been brought from

<p>Charleston when it was evacuated. General Mower fired them in honor
</p>
<p>of Mr. Lincoln's inauguration for the second time. These were all
</p>
<p>destroyed. While the left crossed Thompson's Creek on the 5th, the
</p>
<p>right, and part of the left wing crossed the Great Pardee river ; Davig'a
</p>
<p>corps moving up to Sneadsboro. On the 6th, Davis crossed the Great
</p>
<p>232 GENERAL SHERMAN AND
</p>
<p>Pardee, and the whole army was then out of South Carolina, having en
</p>
<p>tered the old North State on the 5th of March at a point about 53 miles
</p>
<p>from Fayetteville. On the 7th, the left wing moved to Downing river.
</p>
<p>On the 8th, the right wing to Laurel Hill. On the 9th, the entire army
</p>
<p>marched by several roads to within twenty miles of Fayetteville. On
</p>
<p>the 10th, the entire force advanced ten miles, expecting an engage
</p>
<p>ment with General Hardee. Kilpatrick feU on his rear, while retreating,
</p>
<p>and engaged Hampton's cavalry. The fight lasted some hours and
</p>
<p>was hotly contested ; but the rebels were driven from the field. On
</p>
<p>the 12th, Sherman's whole command entered Fayetteville. Here the
</p>
<p>machinery of the Harper's Ferry arsenal was found, and with every spe
</p>
<p>cies of property useful to the enemy entirely destroyed and thrown into
</p>
<p>the river. The campaign from Savannah lasted about fifty-four days,
</p>
<p>some forty of which had been spent in South Carolina, cutting a swath
</p>
<p>about forty miles wide, and leaving only ashes and embers in its track.
</p>
<p>The distance marched was near four hundred and forty- three miles.
</p>
<p>It is marvelous that Johnston, Hardee, Bragg, Hampton, Cheatham,
</p>
<p>S. D. Lee, Wheeler, and Butler, with a force of over 40,000 rebels scat
</p>
<p>tered over North and South Carolina, were unable even to delay the ad
</p>
<p>vance of Sherman. Twenty days constant rains made bad roads flooding
</p>
<p>the rivers and streams. But that was overcome and the great chief
</p>
<p>tain went through the Carolinas as he previously had through Georgia
</p>
<p>and Tennessee. From victory to victory he continued his holiday-march.
</p>
<p>Fourteen cities, hundreds of miles of railroads, and thousands of bales
</p>
<p>of cotton were burned. Eighty-five cannon, four thousand prisoners, and
</p>
<p>twenty-five thousand animals were captured ; and about fifteen thousand
</p>
<p>slaves released from bondage. Sherman had sent from Laurel HiU two
</p>
<p>of his best scouts to give General Terry at Wilmington an account of his
</p>
<p>position and general plans. They reached him on the 12th of March.
</p>
<p>The army tug Davidson was dispatched to Fayetteville the same morn
</p>
<p>ing, giving Sherman all needful information. The tug returned the same
</p>
<p>day and reported to General Terry at Wilmington, and General Scho
</p>
<p>field at Newburn, that Sherman was prepared to move on Goldsboro on
</p>

<p>retreating from Fayetteville halted in a swamp between the Cape Fear
</p>
<p>and South rivers, expecting to hold Sherman in check until Johnston
</p>
<p>would have time to concentrate his scattered forces either at Raleigh,
</p>
<p>Smithfield, or Goldsboro. It was necessary to dislodge Hardee in order
</p>
<p>to get'possession of the Goldsboro road. General Slocum was ordered
</p>
<p>to press, and carry the position. On the 16th, the battle of Averosboro
</p>
<p>was fought by Slocum. Ward's division of infantry foUowed up and
</p>
<p>through the town, developing that Hardee had retreated, not on Raleigh,
</p>
<p>but Smithfield. Ward's division kept up a show of pursuit, while Slo-

</p>
<p>cum's column wheeled to the right, built a bridge across the South river,
</p>
<p>(then very high) and took the road to Goldsboro. He encamped on the
</p>
<p>night of the 18th, twenty-seven miles from Goldsboro. Howard was at
</p>
<p>Lee's store, two miles south ; both had pickets three miles in advance,
</p>
<p>where the two roads met -and led to Goldsboro.
</p>
<p>Howard was ordered to advance by way of the FalUng Creek church,
</p>
<p>from which General Sherman opened communication with General Terry
</p>
<p>coming from Wilmington, and General Schofield advancing from Newburn.
</p>
<p>The former was near Faison's Depot ; the latter at Kingston. The left
</p>
<p>wing under General Slocum now came up with the rebel army ; and finding
</p>
<p>that Johnston with the entire confederate forces in this section was
</p>
<p>massed for battle before him, he commenced to throw up breastworks.
</p>
<p>Kilpatrick hearing the sound of the arOlery hastened up and formed on
</p>
<p>the left. The enemy under Hoke, Hardee, and Cheatham, commanded
</p>
<p>by Johnston himself, made six distinct charges but were repulsed at
</p>
<p>every effort.
</p>
<p>Johnston had come from Smithfield during the night, expecting to
</p>
<p>overwhelm Sherman's left wing. On the 19th, General Slocum received
</p>
<p>reinforcements which made his position impregnable. The right wing
</p>
<p>coming up about three miles east of the battle field of the day before,
</p>
<p>near BentonviUe, met with rebel cavalry. Johnston intended to fight
</p>
<p>and whip the left and right wings of Sherman's army in detail, but in
</p>
<p>stead of doing that, was out-manoeuvred by Sherman, and thrown entirely
</p>
<p>on the defence. On the 20th, he was confronted with Sherman's entire
</p>
<p>army with MU1 Creek and a single bridge at his rear. This was the con
</p>
<p>dition of things at BentonviUe on the 21st of March ; on the same day
</p>
<p>Schofield entered Goldsboro. General Terry had possession of the
</p>
<p>Neuse river at Cox's bridge, about ten miles above the city, with pon
</p>
<p>toons laid, and one brigade across the river.
</p>
<p>The 21st was a wet day, raining continually ; but General Sherman or
</p>
<p>dered General Mower's division of the 17th corps, on the enemy's ex
</p>
<p>treme right, while an attack was made on right and left by skirmishers.
</p>
<p>This was done to prevent Johnston falling on Mower's division and over
</p>
<p>powering it. On the night of the 21st, Johnston with his entire force re

</p>
<p>treated to Smithfield ; at day-break he was pursued about two miles be
</p>
<p>yond Mill Creek, when General Sherman called back those in pursuit.
</p>
<p>Sherman's loss at BentonviUe of the left wing was 9 officers and 145
</p>
<p>men killed ; 51 officers and 816 wounded ; and 3 officers and 223 missing
</p>
<p>taken prisoners by the enemy. Total loss, 1,247. The right wing lost
</p>
<p>2 officers, and 35 men kiUed ; 12 officers, and 239 men wounded ; and
</p>
<p>one officer and 60 men missing. Total 399. The Union loss at Benton
</p>
<p>viUe was about 1,646. 267 dead rebels were left on the field, and buried
</p>
<p>by Sherman's troops, and 1625 taken prisoners. General Sherman met
</p>
<p>234 GENERAL 'SHERMAN AND
</p>
<p>General Terry for the first time at Cox's bridge on the 22d, and on the
</p>
<p>following day went into Goldsboro, where he met General Schofield with
</p>
<p>his army who had possession of the place. The left wing entered that
</p>
<p>evening and the next morning, while the right wing came in on the 24th.
</p>
<p>General Sherman having now united his forces with General Terry and
</p>
<p>General Schofield, and on the previous day having whipped the entire
</p>
<p>rebel army in North Carolina under Johnston, he immediately started
</p>
<p>for City Point, Virginia, to consult with General Grant, leaving General
</p>
<p>Schofield in command of all the union forces around Goldsboro. He
</p>
<p>reached Grant's head-quarters on the evening of March 27th, and met
</p>
<p>General Grant, President Lincoln, Generals Meade, Ord, and other offi
</p>
<p>cers of the army of the Potomac. These chieftains had a consultation,
</p>
<p>and Sherman returned on the navy steamer Bat, via Hatteras Inlet and
</p>
<p>Newburn, reaching his camp at Goldsboro on the night of the 30th of
</p>
<p>March. His great object had been accomplished  forming a junction
</p>
<p>with Schofield and Terry. He was now in communication with General
</p>
<p>Grant, and ready to cooperate in the spring campaign of 1865. Within
</p>
<p>striking distance of the rear of the great rebel Capital, the doom of
</p>
<p>Richmond was sealed.
</p>
<p>General Sherman intended to move rapidly north by way of Burkes-
</p>
<p>ville, threatening Raleigh, and thus get between the two rebel armies,
</p>
<p>commanded by Lee, and Johnston. But the brilliant achievements of
</p>
<p>General Grant's army on the first, second, and third of April at Peters
</p>
<p>burg and Richmond, showed that the armies of the Potomac and James
</p>
<p>under Lieutenant General Grant were abundantly able to take care of the
</p>
<p>rebel army under Lee. The status undergoing a change, it became
</p>
<p>General Sherman's duty to capture or destroy the army of Johnston.
</p>
<p>On the 6th of April he estimated Johnston's force around Smithfield to
</p>
<p>be, infantry and artiUery, 35,000 ; his cavalry to number from 6,000 to
</p>
<p>10,000. Their cavalry force out-numbered Sherman's, and for that reason
</p>
<p>he held General Kilpatrick in reserve at Mount Olive with orders to re
</p>
<p>cruit his horses, and to be ready to march on the 10th of April. Sher
</p>
<p>man in his report, dated City Point, Virginia, May 9th, 1865, says :

<p>motion straight against the enemy. Major General H. W. Slocum taking
</p>
<p>the two direct roads for Smithfield ; Major General O. O. Howard making a
</p>
<p>circuit by the right, and feigning up the Weldon road to disconcert the ene

<p>my's cavalry. Generals Terry and Kilpatrick moving on the west side of
</p>
<p>the Neuse River, and to reach the rear of the enemy between Smithfield
</p>
<p>and Raleigh. General Schofield followed General Slocum in support : all
</p>
<p>the columns met within Six miles of Goldsboro, more or less cavalry with the
</p>
<p>usual rail-bairicades, which were swept before us as chaif, and by 10 a. m.-
</p>
<p>of the 11th, the Fourteenth corps entered Smithfield, the Twentieth corps

</p>
<p>close at hand. Johnston had rapidly retreated across the Neuse river, and
</p>
<p>having his raihoad to lighten up his trains, could retreat faster than we
</p>
<p>could pursue. The rains had also set in, making the resort to corduroy ab
</p>
<p>solutely necessary to pass even ambulances. The enemy had burned the
</p>
<p>bridge at Smithfield, and as soon as possible Major General Slocum got his
</p>
<p>pontoons and crossed over a division of the Fourteenth corps.
</p>
<p>" We then heard of the surrender of Lee's army at Appomattox Court-house,
</p>
<p>Virginia, which was announced to the armies in orders, and created univer
</p>
<p>sal joy. Not one officer or soldier of my army but expressed a pride and
</p>
<p>satisfaction that it fell to the lot of the armies of the Potomac and James so
</p>
<p>gloriously to overwhelm and capture the entire army that had held them in
</p>
<p>check so long, and their success gave new impulse to finish up our task.
</p>
<p>"Without a moment's hesitation we dropped our trains, re-marched rapid
</p>
<p>ly in pursuit tor and through Raleigh, reaching that place at 7 : 30 a. m. on
</p>
<p>the 13th, in a heavy rain. The next day the cavalry pushed on through
</p>
<p>the rain to Durham's Station, the Fifteenth corps foUowing as far as Morris-
</p>
<p>viUe Station, and the Seventeenth corps to John's Station. On the supposi
</p>
<p>tion that Johnston was tied to his raihoad, as a line of retreat by Hillsboro,
</p>
<p>Greenboro, Salisbury, and Charlotte, etc, I had turned the other columns
</p>
<p>across the bend in that road towards Ashborough, (See Special Field Order
</p>
<p>No. 55.) The cavalry, Brevet Major General J. Kilpatrick commanding,
</p>
<p>was ordered to keep up a show of pursuit towards the ' Company Shops,'
</p>
<p>in Alamancer county ; Major General O. O. Howard to turn the left by
</p>
<p>Hackney's Cross-roads, Pittsburgh, St. Lawrence and Ashborough; Major
</p>
<p>General H. W. Slocum to cross Cape Fear river at Avon's Ferry and move
</p>
<p>rapidly by Carthage, Caladonia, and Cox's Mills. Major General J. M.
</p>
<p>Schofield was to hold Raleigh, and the road back, with spare force to follow
</p>
<p>by an intermediate route."
</p>
<p>On the 14th of April, Johnston sent a communication to General Sherman
</p>
<p>enquiring if he had power to arrange for the suspension of hostilifies ; to

<p>which Sherman sent the foUowing reply :

<p>thermore, to obtain from General Grant an order to suspend the movements
</p>
<p>of any troops from the direction of Virginia. General Stoneman is under
</p>
<p>my command, and my orders will suspend any devastation or destruction
</p>
<p>contemplated by him. I wUl add that I really desire to save the people of
</p>
<p>North Carolina the damage they would sustain by the march of this army

<p>through the central or western parts of the State.
</p>
<p>I am, with respect, your obedient servant,

<p>W. T. SHERMAN, Major General.

<p>"By the 15th, though the rains were incessant, and roads almost impracti

</p>
<p>laid across Cape Fear river at Avon's Ferry ; with the Twentieth corps, Ma

</p>
<p>had the Fifteenth and Seventeenth corps stretched out on the roads toward
</p>
<p>Pittsborough, while General KUpatrick held Durham's Station and Capitol

<p>Hill University. Johnston's army was retreating rapidly on the roads from
</p>
<p>Hillsborough to Greensborough, he himself at Greensborough."
</p>
<p>An agreement was made to meet Johnston at noon on the 17th, provided
</p>
<p>the position of the troops remained statu quo. The railroad to Raleigh,
</p>
<p>twelve miles long, had to be completed by Colonel Wright, together with
</p>
<p>two bridges, and Sherman considered that advantage would be on his side
</p>
<p>by delay. The meeting took place as appointed, and the following agree
</p>
<p>ment was entered into : It will be seen that Sherman refused to recognize
</p>
<p>any such authority as the Confederate States. Treating with Johnston and

<p>Breckinridge as insurgent generals, at the same time the conditions agreed

<p>About one hour after Sherman and his staff left Raleigh, to meet John

<p>ceived the news of the President's death while in conference with Johnston,

</p>
<p>and before the above agreement was signed.
</p>
<p>Of the cowardly assassination of Mr. Lincoln, he says : " The news of
</p>
<p>President Lincoln's assassination, on the 14th of April (wrongly reported to
</p>
<p>me by telegraph as having occurred on the 11th), reached me on the 17th,
</p>
<p>and was announced to my command on the same day, in Field Orders No.
</p>
<p>56. I was duly informed with its horrible atrocity and probable effects ou
</p>
<p>the country. But when the property and interests of millions stUl Uving
</p>
<p>238 GENERAL SHERMAN AND
</p>
<p>were involved, I saw no good reason why to change my course, but thought
</p>
<p>rather to manifest real respect for his memory by following, after his death,
</p>
<p>that policy which, if living, I felt certain he would have approved, or at
</p>
<p>least not rejected with disdain."
</p>
<p>The bitter feeling created by the assassination of President Lincoln,
</p>
<p>with other very weighty objections, were such as tocause the new Presi
</p>
<p>dent and his advisers to refuse to ratify the Memoranda or negotiations
</p>
<p>with Johnston.
</p>
<p>General .Sherman's idea was, that Johnston had itinhis power to escape
</p>
<p>with his army through Charlotte, North CaroUna, and thus indefinitely
</p>
<p>prolong the war. He says : " Up to that hour I had never received one
</p>
<p>word of instruction, advice, or counsel, as to the plan or policy of the
</p>
<p>Government, looking to a restoration of peace on the part of the Rebel
</p>
<p>States of the South. Whenever asked for an opinion on the points in
</p>
<p>volved, I had always avoided the subject." He first offered the same
</p>
<p>terms to Johnston that Lee received from General Grant. But when he
</p>
<p>met Johnston again, Sherman says : " He satisfied me then of his power
</p>
<p>to disband the rebel armies in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and
</p>
<p>Texas, as weU as those in his immediate command, viz. : North Carolina,
</p>
<p>Georgia and Florida. The points on which he expressed espeoial solici
</p>
<p>tude were, lest their States were to be dismembered and denied repre
</p>
<p>sentation in Congress, or any separate political existence whatever ; and
</p>
<p>the absolute disarming his men would leave the South powerless and ex
</p>
<p>posed to depredation by wicked bands of assassins and robbers. The
</p>
<p>President's (Lincoln) Message of 1864 ; his Amnesty Proclamation ;
</p>
<p>General Grant's terms to General Lee, substantially extending the bene
</p>
<p>fit of that Proclamation to all ofiicers below the rank of colonel; the
</p>
<p>invitation to the Virginia Legislature to re-assemble in Richmond, by
</p>
<p>General Weitzel, with the supposed approval of Mr. Lincoln and General
</p>
<p>Grant, then on the spot ; a firm behef that I had been fighting to reestab
</p>
<p>lish the Constitution of the United States ; and last, but not least, the
</p>
<p>general and universal desire to close a war any longer without organized
</p>
<p>resistance, were the leading facts that induced me to pen the ' memoran
</p>
<p>dum' of April 18, signed by myself and General Johnston."

</p>
<p>On the receipt at the war office of the memorandum of negotiations
</p>
<p>entered into between Generals Sherman and Johnston, the articles were
</p>
<p>submitted to a Cabinet Meeting on the same evening, April 21st, and
</p>
<p>disapproved ; and General Grant dispatched immediately to the field of
</p>
<p>action. He arrived at Sherman's head-quarters on the 24th; and imme
</p>
<p>diately informed General Sherman that his memorandum had been re
</p>
<p>jected, and ordered that he should give Johnston forty-eight hours notice,
</p>
<p>and resume hostilities at the end of that time. Sherman says in his .1
</p>
<p>report: " General Grant had orders from the President to direct military
</p>
<p>HIS GREAT CAMPAIGNS. 239
</p>
<p>movements, and I explained to him the exact position of the troops, and
</p>
<p>he approved of it mott emphatically ; but he did not reUeve me, or ex
</p>
<p>press a wish to assume command.
</p>
<p>' ' All things were in readiness, when, on the evening of the 25th, I
</p>
<p>received another letter from General Johnston asking another interview
</p>
<p>to renew negotiations. General Grant not only approved, but urged me
</p>
<p>to accept, and I appointed a meeting at our former place at noon of the
</p>
<p>26th, Jhe very hour fixed for the renewal of hostilities. General John
</p>
<p>ston was delayed by an accident to his train, but at two p. m. arrived.
</p>
<p>" We then consulted, concluded and signed the final terms of capitula
</p>
<p>tion. These were taken by me back to Raleigh, submitted to General
</p>
<p>Grant, and met his immediate approval and signature. General Johnston
</p>
<p>was not even aware of the presence of General Grant at Raleigh at the
</p>
<p>time. There was surrendered to us the second great army of the so-
</p>
<p>called Confederacy ; and though undue importance has been given to the
</p>
<p>so-caUed negotiations which preceded it, and a rebuke and public dis
</p>
<p>favor cast on me whoUy unwarranted by the facts, I rejoice in saying,
</p>
<p>that it was accomplished without further ruin and devastation to the
</p>
<p>country ; without the loss of a single Ufe to those gallant men who had
</p>
<p>foUowed me from the Mississippi to the Atlantic ; and without subject
</p>
<p>ing brave men to the ungracious task of pursuing a fleeing foe that did
</p>
<p>not want to fight. As for myself, I know my motives, and chaUenge the
</p>
<p>instance during the last four years, when an armed and defiant foe stood
</p>
<p>before me, that I did not go in for a fight, and I would blush for shame
</p>
<p>if I had ever insulted or struck a fallen foe.
</p>
<p>' ' The instant the terms of surrender were approved by General Grant,
</p>
<p>I made my orders, No. 65, assigning to each of my subordinate command
</p>
<p>ers his share of the work, and, with General Grant's approval, made
</p>
<p>Special Orders No. 66, putting in motion my old army, no longer required
</p>
<p>in Carolina, northward for Richmond. General Grant left Raleigh at 9
</p>
<p>a. m. of the 27th ; and I glory in the fact that during his three days stay
</p>
<p>with me, I did not detect in his language or manner one particle pf abate
</p>
<p>ment in the confidence, respect and affection that have existed between
</p>
<p>us throughout all the various events of the past war ; and though we have

</p>
<p>honestly differed in other cases as well as this, stiU we respect each
</p>
<p>other's honest convictions. I still adhere to my then opinions, that by a
</p>
<p>few general concessions, 'glittering generalities,' all of which in the end
</p>
<p>must and wUl be conceded to the organized States of the South, this day
</p>
<p>there would not be an armed battalion opposed to us within the broad area
</p>
<p>of the dominions of the United States. Robbers and assassins must, in any
</p>
<p>event, result from the disbandment of large armies ; but even these should
</p>
<p>be, and can be, taken care of by" the local civil authorities, without being
</p>
<p>made a charge on the National Treasury.
</p>
<p>240 GENERAL SHERMAN AND
</p>
<p>"On the evening of the 28th, having concluded all business requiring my
</p>
<p>personal attention at Raleigh, and having conferred with every army com
</p>
<p>mander, and delegated to him the authority necessary for his future action',
</p>
<p>I dispatched my head-quarters wagons by land, along with the seventeenth
</p>
<p>corps, the officer in charge of General Webster, to Alexandria, Va., and in
</p>
<p>person, accompanied only by my personal staff, hastened to Savannah to
</p>
<p>direct matters in the interior of South Carolina and Georgia."
</p>
<p>Johnston's army was divided into three grand corps commanded by Gene
</p>
<p>ral's Hardee, Stewart, and Stephen D. Lee. The great body at the time of
</p>
<p>its surrender was about eighty miles from Raleigh, near Greensborough, the
</p>
<p>camps extended along the railroad above and below the town, forming a
</p>
<p>line of about fifteen miles in extent, and in all numbered about twenty
</p>
<p>thousand men. The details of the capitulation were left to be carried out
</p>
<p>by Major General Schofield, who appointed Major General Hartsuff in
</p>
<p>spector-general of the twenty-third corps, who, with Majors Lord, Walcott,
</p>
<p>Letcher, and Captain Lyons proceeded to the front. They were received at
</p>
<p>the head-quarters of the rebel general with marked courtesy. One hundred
</p>
<p>and fifty pieces of artillery, with caissons complete, together with horses and
</p>
<p>harness, and thousands of small arms, were surrendered. At Raleigh speech-
</p>
<p>makings and torch light processions were indulged in by the victorious
</p>
<p>army. The Tenth Iowa Regiment, preceded by a fine band of music, visited
</p>
<p>General Howard's headquarters and gave cheers for him and the prospect
</p>
<p>of peace.
</p>
<p>The final terms granted to Johnston, and which he was forced to accept,
</p>
<p>were liberal in the extreme, and are an additional proof of tho magnanimity
</p>
<p>of the loyal people of tho Union. The vanquished forces of Johnston were
</p>
<p>allowed to retain all their horses excepting alone the artillery horses, all
</p>
<p>their wagons, and five per cent, of their small arms. The commissioned
</p>
<p>officers were allowed to retain their side arms, horses and baggage. Five
</p>
<p>per cent, of the small arms were distributed among the enlisted men to
</p>
<p>protect them on their way home.
</p>
<p>The settling of the details of the capitulation, required several days. On
</p>
<p>the 1st of May all was finished. On the 2d, General Schofield, accompanied
</p>
<p>by Colonels Wherry and Twining of his staff, took a special train for

<p>Greensborough ; they arrived there at noon. General Schofield visited Gener
</p>
<p>al Johnston and spent the afternoon with him.
</p>
<p>Among the general officers surrendered by Johnston are the following :
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Generals W. J. Hardee, Stewart, and Stephen D. Lee ; Major
</p>
<p>Generals D. H. Hill, and Wm. Bate ; Brigadier Generals J. H. Sharp, Hen

<p>HIS GREAT CAMPAIGNS. 241
</p>
<p>where Sherman and Johnston met to arrange the terms of surrender, suffered
</p>
<p>at the hands of relic gatherers. The table on which the memoranda were

<p>written has been cut to fragments, and is in the hands of soldiers. The

<p>General Howard's army left for the North on the morning of May 3d, and
</p>
<p>Slocum's left the next day for Richmond, Va. General Paine's division of
</p>
<p>colored troops were sent back to Goldsboro, North Carolina. Howard's
</p>
<p>corps went by way of Louisburgh, Warrenton, Laurenceville, and Peters-

<p>Headquarters Military Division ot the Mississippi, |
</p>
<p>In the Field, Raleigh, April 17, 1865. j
</p>
<p>Special Field Obdee, No. 56. The General commanding announces,
</p>
<p>with pain and sorrow, that on the evening of the 11th inst., at the Theatre
</p>
<p>in Washington City, his Excellency the President of the United States, Mr.
</p>
<p>Lincoln, was assassinated by one who uttered the State motto of Virginia.
</p>
<p>At the same time the Secretary of State, Mr. Seward, while suffering from a
</p>
<p>broken arm, was also stabbed by another murderer in his own house,, but
</p>
<p>stiU survives, and his son was wounded, supposed fatally.
</p>
<p>It is beUeved by persons capable of judging that other high officers were
</p>
<p>designed to share the same fate. Thus it seems that our enemy, despairing
</p>
<p>of meeting us in manly warfare, begins to resort to the assassin's tools.
</p>
<p>Your General does not wish you to infer that this is universal ; for he knows
</p>
<p>that the great mass of the Confederate Army would scorn to sanction such
</p>
<p>acts, but he believes it the legitimate consequence of rebellion against right
</p>
<p>ful authority. We have met every phase which this war has assumed, and
</p>
<p>must now be prepared for it in its last and worst shape, that of assassins
</p>
<p>and guerrillas ; but woe unto the people who seek to expend.their wild pas
</p>
<p>sions in such a manner, for there is but one dread result.

<p>spectators. This was a glorious day for the nation ! a proud day for the

</p>
<p>Headquarters, Middle Division of the Mississippi, in the Field, )
</p>
<p>Washington, D. C, May 30th, 1865. j
</p>
<p>The General Commanding announces to the Armies of the Tennessee
</p>
<p>and Georgia, that the time has come for us to .part. Our work is done,
</p>
<p>and armed enemies no longer defy us. Some of you will be retained in
</p>
<p>service until further orders. And now that we are about to separate, to
</p>
<p>mingle with the civil world, it becomes a pleasing duty to recaU to mind
</p>
<p>the situation 'of national affairs when, but little more than a year ago, we
</p>
<p>were gathered about the twining cliffs of Lookout Mountain, and all the
</p>
<p>future was wrapped in doubt and uncertainty. Three armies had come
</p>
<p>together from distant fields, with separate histories, yet bound by one
</p>
<p>common cause  the union of our country and the perpetuation of the gov
</p>
<p>ernment of our inheritance. There is no need to recaU to your memories
</p>
<p>Tunnell Hill, with its Rocky Face Mountain, andBuzzard Roost Gap ,with the
</p>
<p>ugly forts of Dalton behind. We were in earnest, and paused not for danger
</p>
<p>and difficulty, but dashed through Snake Creek Gap, and feU on Ressacca,
</p>
<p>then on to Etowah, to Dallas, Kenesaw ; and the heats of summer found
</p>
<p>us on the banks of the Chattahoochee, far from home and dependent on a
</p>
<p>single road for supplies. Again we were not to be held back by any
</p>
<p>obstacle, and crossed over and fought four heavy battles for the possession
</p>
<p>of the citadel of Atlanta. That was the crisis of our history. A doubt
</p>
<p>still clouded our future ; but we solved ihe problem, and, destroying
</p>
<p>Atlanta, struck boldly across the State of Georgia, secured all the main
</p>
<p>arteries of life to our enemy, and Christmas found us at Savannah. Wait
</p>
<p>ing there only long enough to fill our wagons, we again began a march,
</p>
<p>which for peril, labor and results, will compare with any ever made by
</p>
<p>an organized army. The pods of the Savannah, the swamps of the Com-
</p>
<p>bahee and Edisto, the high hills and rocks of the Santee, the flat quag
</p>
<p>mires of the Pedee and Cape Fear Rivers, were all passed in midwinter,
</p>
<p>with its floods and rains, in the face of an accumulating enemy ; and after
</p>
<p>the battles of Averysboro and Bentensville, we once more came out of
</p>
<p>the wilderness to meetonr friends at Goldsboro. Even then we paused

<p>only long enough to get new clothing, and to reload our wagons, and
</p>
<p>again pushed on to Raleigh, and beyond, until we met our enemy, sueing
</p>
<p>for peace instead of war, and offering to submit to the injured laws of his
</p>
<p>.and our country. As long as that enemy was defiant, nor mountains nor

<p>rivers, nor swamps nor hunger, nor cold had checked us ; but when he

<p>the army have contributed to the overthrow of the confederacy, of the
</p>
<p>peace which dawns on us, must be judged by others, and not by us. But
</p>
<p>that you have done aU that men could do, has been admitted by those in
</p>
<p>authority ; and we have a right to join in the universal joy that fills our
</p>
<p>land because the war is over, and our government stands vindicated be
</p>
<p>fore the world by the joint action of the volunteer armies of the United
</p>
<p>States. To such as remain in the military service, your General need only re
</p>
<p>mind you that the successes of the past are due to hard work and disci
</p>
<p>pline, and that the same work and discipline are equally important in the
</p>
<p>future. To such as go home, he will only say, that our favored country
</p>
<p>is so grand, so extensive, so diversified in climate, soil and productions,
</p>
<p>that every man may surely find a home and occupation suited to his tastes ;
</p>
<p>and none should yield to the natural impotence sure to result from
</p>
<p>our past life of excitement and adventure. Tou will be invited to seek
</p>
<p>new adventure abroad ; but do not yield to the temptation, for it wiU
</p>
<p>lead only to death and disappointment.
</p>
<p>Tour General now bids you all fareweU, with the full belief that, as in

<p>THE FALL OF CHARLESTON, S. C.
</p>
<p>The bold advance of Sherman's great army into the heari of South
</p>
<p>Carolina compelled the rebel General Hardee to evacuate -Charleston- As
</p>
<p>soon as the rebel general learned that Sherman had destroyed two of the
</p>
<p>principal railroads, and was preparing to tare up the Florence, the last
</p>
<p>one leading into the city, whUe thus meditating on 'his position, the
</p>
<p>lightning conveyed the intelligence to hhn of the capture of Columbia !
</p>
<p>Hardee now became panic-stricken, and the evacuation of this treasona
</p>
<p>ble den commenced. Although the army of Sherman was over one hun
</p>
<p>dred and twenty-five miles off, yet Charleston was flanked, and no
</p>
<p>longer tenable in a military point of view. Admiral Dahlgreen, and
</p>
<p>General Gilmore, who had been long watching their opportunity now
</p>
<p>began to discover the effects of a fire on the flank. Pleasanton was dis
</p>
<p>covered to be secretly withdrawing, and retreating over the road by
</p>
<p>Christ's Church. The garrison on James Island, and the rebel troopB in
</p>
<p>the city, began to retreat by the North Eastern Rail Road. Witnessing
</p>
<p>this, Colonel Bennett commanding the 21st U. S. colored troops on Mor
</p>
<p>is Island, dispatched Major Hennessey of the 52d Pennsylvania Volun
</p>
<p>teers, with a few men in a small boat, to ascertain if Fort Sumter was evac
</p>
<p>uated. Hardly had this gallant officer with his brave men time to reach
</p>
<p>and enter its battlements, when to the astonishment of thousands the
</p>
<p>Star Spangled Banner was unfurled, and floated in triumph over its
</p>
<p>battered walls. The sight of the flag was sufficient to create demonstra
</p>
<p>tions of joy, and it was hailed by all on ship, and shore. Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Colonel Bennett, Major Hennessey, and Lieutenant Bar of the 52d Pennsyl
</p>
<p>vania started with a few colored troops for the city, leaving orders for
</p>
<p>others to follow.
</p>
<p>The approach of a Yankee boat was a strange sight at the Charleston
</p>
<p>wharf. Thousands of blacks, and a great number of whites were standing
</p>
<p>on the shore when it came up. Colonel Bennett was the first to land,
</p>
<p>and was immediately followed by the others in the boat. To their as
</p>
<p>tonishment the blacks seized their hands and kissed them with delight,
</p>
<p>crying " Glory Hallelujah 1 dis is de army ob de Lord ! we watched for
</p>
<p>you dis four long year, we's happy now I" The officers and men were
</p>
<p>surprised to see many whites in this den of traitors who appeared to

</p>
<p>cavalry yet lingered around the suburbs to prevent the firemen and de
</p>
<p>serters (who were secreted in houses) from extinguishing the flames.
</p>
<p>They soon fled, when the Union troops began to march up Murry street.
</p>
<p>Here as at the landing, the blacks were wUd with deUght, every where
</p>
<p>hailing the Union officers and men as their deliverers ; and when the
</p>
<p>soldiers struck up the John Brown song, it filled the eyes of the blacks.
</p>
<p>with tears, and their hearts with joy to hear the boys sing :
</p>
<p>John Brown's body lies a mouldering in the grave,
</p>
<p>While weep the sons of bondage whom he ventured all to save,
</p>
<p>But though he lost his life, in struggling for the slave,
</p>

<p>Chorus  Glory, Glory, Hallelujah !
</p>
<p>Glory, Glory, Hallelujah !
</p>
<p>Glory, Glory, Hallelujah !
</p>
<p>His soul is marching on.
</p>
<p>John Brown was a hero undaunted, true and brave,
</p>
<p>And Kansas knew his valor when he foughther rights to save ;
</p>
<p>And now, though the grass grows green above his grave,
</p>
<p>His soul is marching on. Glory, &c
</p>
<p>He captured Harper's Ferry with his nineteen men so true,
</p>
<p>And he frightened old Virgihny till she trembled through and through ;

<p>They hung him for a traitor, themselves a traitor ere w,

</p>
<p>It is important that posterity should know something of the history of
</p>
<p>this family; as one of them, Barnwell Rhett, owned and published the
</p>
<p>Charleston Mercury, and had the unenviable distinction of hoisting in
</p>
<p>Broad street, over the office of that infamous sheet, the first rebel bastard
</p>
<p>flag ever seen in the United States.
</p>
<p>The sire of this treacherous family's original name was Smith, He was
</p>
<p>a native of the north of Ireland, and in religion, a catholic. Arriving in
</p>
<p>America, he immediately changed his name to Rhett, and in order more
</p>
<p>effectually to disguise himself, denied his religion and became a prot
</p>
<p>estant. From him sprang all the people of the name of Rhett, now living
</p>
<p>in South Carolina. Some say he changed his name to elude pursuit ;
</p>
<p>others that it was done to inherit property by fraud ; one thing is sure, 
</p>
<p>it was done, and it is right that it should be known everywhere.

<p>sketch of the city.
</p>
<p>The city of Charleston, the oldest in rebellion (having entered upon its in
</p>
<p>glorious career of treason on the 20th of December, 1860, with the seces
</p>
<p>sion of the State, and inaugurated the war by firing on Fort Sumter April
</p>
<p>12, 1861), is also one of the oldest in the United States, having been found
</p>
<p>ed in 1672. Its population was recruited some years afterwards by Hugue
</p>
<p>not refugees who emigrated from France, and settled in pretty considerable
</p>
<p>numbers in South Carolina. It was not till 1783 that it was incorporated
</p>
<p>as a city. Fifty-two years previously, in 1731, it contained six hundred
</p>
<p>houses and five churches, #nd a thriving business was done in its port. Du
</p>
<p>ring the Revolutionary war the possession of the harbor of Charleston was
</p>
<p>the object of more than one British expedition. A garrison of four hundred
</p>
<p>on Sullivan's Island, under the command of Colonel Moultrie, achieved
</p>
<p>great distinction by the repulse, on June 28, 1776, of a British squadron of
</p>
<p>nine ships-of- war. Onthe 12th of May, 1780, the city was surrendered to
</p>
<p>Sir Henry Clinton by General Lincoln, the corporation and principal citizens
</p>
<p>refusing to co-operate in its defence, and offering to acknowledge the sovreign-
</p>
<p>ty of Great Britain. The British held it till May, 1782.
</p>
<p>It is also the largest city in the State. It is built on a peninsula, or tongue
</p>
<p>of land, between the Ashley and Cooper rivers, which unite below the town,
</p>
<p>and form a spacious harbor, communicating with the ocean at Sullivan's Is
</p>
<p>land, seven miles distant. Both harbor and city somewhat resemble New
</p>
<p>York and its bay, in miniature. There is, however, this striking difference :
</p>
<p>that the portion of Charleston called the Battery, and corresponding to our
</p>
<p>Battery and to State Street, is the most fashionable part of the city. The
</p>
<p>city is regularly built, and extends nearly two mUes in length, and a mjila
</p>
<p>and a half in breadth. Some of the streets are from sixty to seventy feet
</p>
<p>broad, and some are narrow-^for instance, King street, the Broadway of
</p>
<p>Charleston. The streets run mostly parallel to each other, running across

<p>The'city has, of course, suffered much in appearance from the ravages of

<p>them ancient landmarks  where large assemblages were wont to bow at
</p>
<p>holy altars, and spacious halls that once blazed with light and rung with
</p>
<p>festal songs,  are all deserted, sombre and cheerless ; and this is enhanced by
</p>
<p>the forbidding aspect1 of that vast district of the city which was laid in ashes
</p>
<p>three years ago, and which remaines in unmolested ruins as the monument
</p>
<p>of Charleston's long and dreary pause in the grand march' of improvement.

<p>CAPTURE OF THE CITY OF WILMINGTON, N. C.
</p>
<p>The fall of Columbia the Capital of South Carolina, and Charleston the

</p>
<p>which had become the chief port of entry and rendezvous for Enghsh

</p>
<p>had been so successful in several engagements in Tennesse, had com

<p>and Admiral Porter had on the 24th and 25th of December Made an effort

<p>to capture Fort Fisher, commanding the entrance to the harbor ; but

<p>from some strange misunderstanding about time, failed. Two months had

<p>been spent in preparing for this important movement, but- General Scho*

<p>On the night of the 20th of February, the rebels drew ont into the stream

</p>
<p>when on the 21st theUhidn forces, under General Cox, came in sight of
</p>
<p>the city. The same night the Union troops took possession of the raU-
</p>
<p>way leading to Charleston, and General Casement pushed his pickets
</p>
<p>down the river bank directly opposite the city. Cox's troops approach
</p>
<p>ed through a swamp; and finally crossed the Brunswick River in flat-
</p>
<p>boats, found at, or near the crossing. General Terry on the left flank
</p>
<p>was steadily advancing. The rebels, though entrenched, fled before

<p>Ames's and Payne's divisions. Fort St. Phillip- was evacuated on the
</p>
<p>night of the 21st, and the rebel General Bragg, who was entrusted with

<p>of the 22d, Washington's birthday, while flags were everywhere to be
</p>
<p>seen floating onthe buildings in token of surrender, at precisely nine
</p>
<p>o'clock General Terry, with his command, entered the city, and received

<p>its surrender from John Dawson. Major Clement's, and Cox's divisions
</p>
<p>soon followed. The negroes were eveiywhere jubilant. Their friendship
</p>
<p>here as weU as at all other points, showed them constant and true, will
</p>
<p>with delight when first meeting, and weeping when parting with the

</p>
<p>were captured with the city.

<p>oners in the Rebel hospitals had been vacinated with venereal matter,

<p>and that this accounted for the frightful sores of the bodies of so many of

<p>them. North Carolina furnished one hundred and ten thousand men for the

<p>rebel army. Not more than ten thousand of this vast number held slaves
</p>
<p>or had any interest in the dying institution. The rebel leaders always
</p>
<p>distrusted their fidelity to the cause of treason. They had an idea that
</p>
<p>the non-slaveholding whites of the old North State were instinctively
</p>
<p>loyal to the Federal union for being thus suspected. Regiments from the

<p>LIEUTENANT-GENERAL ULYSSES SIMPSON GRANT. U. 8. A.

</p>
<p>LIEUTENANT GENERAL GRANT.
</p>
<p>HIS EARLY HISTORY.
</p>
<p>SERVICES ZEST MEXICO
</p>
<p>AND
</p>
<p>HIS MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENTS IN OVERTHROWING
</p>
<p>THE GREAT SLAVEHOLDERS' REBELLION
</p>
<p>AGAINST THE AMERICAN UNION.
</p>
<p>In the early part of the sixteenth century two brothers emigrated from
</p>
<p>Scotland to America.  one settled in Connecticut, and the other in New Jer
</p>
<p>sey. From the one who had chosen Connecticut as his home, sprang the
</p>
<p>family of which Gen. Ulysses Simpson Grant is a descendant. It appears
</p>
<p>that some of the descendants of this Connecticut brother wandered off into
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania. Jesse R. Grant, the father of the illustrious chief, was born
</p>
<p>in Westmorland county, of that State. In 1794, Jesse R. Grant moved from
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania into Ohio, and was engaged in carrying on a tannery. John
</p>
<p>Simpson, heretofore residing in Montgomery county, Pennsylvania, in 1818,
</p>
<p>with his family, moved to Clearmont county, Ohio. Miss Hannah, daughter
</p>
<p>of Mr. John Simpson, having for some months received the attention of the
</p>
<p>tanner, in June 1821, consented to become Mrs. Jesse R. Grant.
</p>
<p>While thus newly married, they settled at Point Pleasant, about twenty-
</p>
<p>five nules above Cincinnati, Ohio. Here, on the seventh day of April, 1822,
</p>
<p>U. S. Grant was born.
</p>
<p>From here, Mr. Grant, with his family, moved to Georgetown, the capital
</p>
<p>of Brown county, Ohio, and it was in this place that young Ulysses began
</p>
<p>to receive the rudiments of his early education. His intellect, like most great
</p>
<p>minds, was slow to develop ; he was remarkable for his perseverance, but
</p>
<p>otherwise he was not considered bright.
</p>
<p>On one occasion his teacher had given him a task to perform, in mas
</p>
<p>tering which he experienced more than usual difficulty. A schoolmate,
</p>
<p>noticing his trouble, remarked : "You can't master that task." The per
</p>
<p>severing lad replied that he did not know the meaning of the word " can't,"

</p>
<p>ing it in the book he referred the matter to the teacher, who explained the
</p>
<p>origin of the word, and was so much pleased with the pupil's action in the
</p>
<p>case, that he related the anecdote to the entire school, and impressed upon
</p>
<p>them the importance of accomplishing whatever they might undertake, and
</p>
<p>always to remember that there/is no such woti! as can't.
</p>
<p>The boy, even at that early age; had a great reverence for Washington.
</p>
<p>While at school at Georgetown, a cousin of his, whose parents had settled
</p>
<p>in Canada, and entertained strong distaste for everything American  even
</p>
<p>Washmgton was the butt of ridicule. John, for that was his cousin's name,
</p>
<p>was in Ohio going to the same school, having imbibed these Anti- American
</p>
<p>notions from his parents, began to speak. disrespectfuUy of Washington.
</p>
<p>Ulysses finally got tired of listening to that kind of slang, and gave John a
</p>
<p>severe thrashing. His mother, being a Christian woman, was about to chastise
</p>
<p>her son for whipping his cousin,, but his father took a very different view of
</p>
<p>the matter, remarking, " A boy that will fight for the honor and integrity of
</p>
<p>the name of Washington, will, in the future, make a brave and useful man,"
</p>
<p>and prevented the chastisement.
</p>
<p>This little incident created a patriotic pride and hope in the father's heart.
</p>
<p>Although unseen and unappreciated by the outside world, yet to him the
</p>
<p>bow of promise and distinction seemed encirchhg his youthful head.
</p>
<p>From this time forward the hopeful parent was determined to procure a
</p>
<p>West Point military education for his son. For this purpose he applied to
</p>
<p>Senator Morris ; but this senator had parted with his right to recommend a
</p>
<p>cadet. Representative Thomas L. Hamer was then applied to, and through
</p>
<p>his influence U. S. Grant, then hv his seventeenth year, entered the West
</p>
<p>Point school July 1st, 1839. While in the fourth class he became the sub
</p>
<p>ject of jest and sport to those who had passed the same ordeal. These
</p>
<p>youths, who had been poking thefr fun at him, were in a higher class. While
</p>
<p>on parade one day, the thing ran so high that young Grant had a set-to
</p>
<p>with the captaihj whipping him. He then turned to the Lieutenant, and
</p>
<p>enquired if he wanted to continue the sport.
</p>
<p>"Yes," says the lieutenant, " I am ready."
</p>
<p>It took young Grant, who then had his hand in at that kind of work, but
</p>
<p>a short time to drub the lieutenant. After he had finished the good work,

</p>
<p>Grant stepped out in front of the company and said: "I ask peace, and, if
</p>
<p>necessary, will fight the company, one by one, to gain it."
</p>
<p>From being the subject of sport, he from thistime on became the object of
</p>
<p>admiration ; being always known afterwards as " Company Grant." In 1840
</p>
<p>he advanced into the third class,; ranking as corporal in the cadet battalion.
</p>
<p>In 1841 he entered the second class, ranking as sergeant, and in 1842 he en
</p>
<p>tered the first; becoming a commissioned officer of the academy. On the
</p>
<p>13th of June, 1843, he graduated number twenty-one in a class of thirty-
</p>
<p>nine. In July, 1843, he entered the United States Army as a brevet second
</p>
<p>SERVICED IN MEXICO. 253
</p>
<p>lieutenant of infantry. He now became a member of the fourth regiment of
</p>
<p>regular infantry, stationed at Jefferson barracks, Missouri.
</p>
<p>He was ordered, in the summer of 1844, to repair to Nachitoches, Louis
</p>
<p>iana, to form part of the command then orgiinizing under Gen. Taylor, in
</p>
<p>anticipation of trouble with Mexico. In 1845 he was ordered to Corpus
</p>
<p>Christi, Mexico, and on September 30th, was made second lieutenant of the
</p>
<p>seventh infanty. His old comrades joined him in a request to the War De
</p>
<p>partment, that he should be permitted to remain with his old friends of the
</p>
<p>fourth. The request was granted by the war department, and he received a
</p>
<p>second lieutenant's commission in the fourth regiment regular infantry.
</p>
<p>In the Mexican war, in the battles of Palo Alto, and Resaca de la Palma,
</p>
<p>he behaved with great bravery. At Monterey and Vera Cruz he also dis
</p>
<p>tinguished himself for gaUant conduct. At the battle of Molino del Rey he
</p>
<p>was promoted to first lieutenant. At Chepultepec, Major Francis Lee, com
</p>
<p>manding the fourth infantry, remarks, "Lieutenant Grant behaved with dis
</p>
<p>tinguished gallantry on the 13th and 14th." Col. John Garland, command
</p>
<p>ing the first brigade, in his report of the battle of Chepultepec, speaks in the
</p>
<p>highest terms : " Lieutenant Grant of the fourth infantry acquitted himself
</p>
<p>most nobly upon several occasions under my own observation."
</p>
<p>General Worth also in his report of September 16th, 1847, bears the
</p>
<p>same testimony. Lieutenant Grant was again promoted for gal
</p>
<p>lantry ; his commission, brevet of captain, dated September 13th, 1847,
</p>
<p>the same day the battle of Chepultepec was fought. Soon after his re
</p>
<p>turn from Mexico he married Miss Julia Dent, a daughter of Frederick
</p>
<p>Dent, and a lady of refinement. Mr. Dent resided atGravois, near St.
</p>
<p>Louis, Missouri. In 1852 the fourth was ordered to the Pacific ; their
</p>
<p>headquarters to be at Fort Dallas, Oregon Territory. In August 1853, he
</p>
<p>was promoted to the rank of captain, being then in the interior of Cali-
</p>
<p>fornia, about 400 miles from the coast.
</p>
<p>July 31st, 1854, he resigned his commission in the service, and took up
</p>
<p>his residence with his father-in-law near St. Louis ; a portion of his time
</p>
<p>was here employed as a coUector and real estate agent, and dealer in
</p>
<p>wood. A writer says of him :
</p>
<p>" General Grant occupied a little farm to the southwest of St. Louis,
</p>
<p>whence he was in the habit of cutting the wood and drawing it to Caron-

</p>
<p>delet, and selling it in the market there. Many of his wood purchasers
</p>
<p>are now caUing to mind that they had a cord of wood delivered in person
</p>
<p>by the great General Grant. When he came into the wood market, he
</p>
<p>was usually dressed in an old felt hat, with a blouse coat, and his pant3
</p>
<p>tucked in the tops of his boots. In truth, he bore the appearance of a
</p>
<p>sturdy, honest woodsman. This was his winter's work. In the summer
</p>
<p>he turned a collector of debts ; but for this he was not qualified. He had
</p>
<p>a noble and truthful soul ; so when he was told that the debtor had no
</p>
<p>254 LIEUTENANT GENERAL GRANT.
</p>
<p>money, he believed him, and would not trouble the debtor again. One
</p>
<p>of the leading merchants of St. Louis mentioned this circumstance to me.
</p>
<p>From aU I can learn of his history here, he was honest, truthful, inde
</p>
<p>fatigable  always at work at something ; but he did not possess the
</p>
<p>knack of making money. He was honorable, for he always repaid bor
</p>
<p>rowed money. His habits of life were hardy, inexpensive, and simple."
</p>
<p>He now, in 1859, removed to Galena, Illinois, where his father, Jesse R.
</p>
<p>Grant, then a man of sixty-five years of ago, was engaged in the leather
</p>
<p>trade. Ulysses became partner in the business with his father. It was
</p>
<p>here in Galena, thus occupied in the peaceful pursuits of civil life, that
</p>
<p>Ulysses Simpson Grant in 1861 resided, when the storm of the rebeUion
</p>
<p>burst with all ita fury.
</p>
<p>When Sumter had been fired upon, Grant believing the Government
</p>
<p>required his services, raised a company in Galena, and proceeded at once
</p>
<p>with it to Springfield, Illinois. Governor Yates was commencing to organ
</p>
<p>ize troops for the aid of the General Government, and he was ready to
</p>
<p>procure the assistance of a West-pointer, giving him a position as aid on
</p>
<p>his staff. After several months of arduous duty in this position, Grant
</p>
<p>requested the Governor to give him an appointment in one of the three
</p>
<p>years regiments then being organized. In the middle of June he resigned
</p>
<p>his position as mustering officer, and was appointed Colonel of the 21st
</p>
<p>Regiment of Illinois Volunteers, organized at Mattoon in that state. From
</p>
<p>here he removed his camp to Caseyville, and after drilling his regiment
</p>
<p>about four weeks, he was ordered to Missouri to guard the Hanibal and
</p>
<p>Hudson railroad in the north part of the state. He was here made acting
</p>
<p>brigadier general, and placed in command of all the troops in the district
</p>
<p>known as North Missouri. In August, his regiment was ordered to
</p>
<p>Pilot Knob, then to Feonton, then to Marble Creek. It was while Grant
</p>
<p>was shifting from position to position with his regiment, that the Gov
</p>
<p>ernment made the hapy hit of appointing him brigadier general of volun
</p>
<p>teers, rank and commission dating from 17th of May, 1861 . About thirty-
</p>
<p>one distinguished military men received appointments to similar posi
</p>
<p>tions at the same time. Among those appointed at that time were Will
</p>
<p>iam T. Sherman, and Cox of Ohio, Hooker of California, McClearnand of
</p>
<p>Rlinois, Franz Siegel of Missouri, S. R. Curtis of Iowa, Heintzleman and

<p>Franklin of Pennsylvania, John W. Phelps of Vermont, and over twenty
</p>
<p>other illustrious names. Some have fallen in battle nobly leading on
</p>
<p>their divisions, while many of them yet hold positions high in the confi
</p>
<p>dence of the Government. Soon after General Grant was appointed, he
</p>
<p>was placed in command of the district composed of Southeast Missouri,
</p>
<p>and Southern Illinois, headquarters at Cairo, located at the junction of
</p>
<p>the Ohio and the Mississippi rivers. i
</p>
<p>From this position, with only two Illinois regiments, four pieces of
</p>
<p>BATTLES OF FREDERICKTOWN AND BELMONT. 255
</p>
<p>artillery, and two gunboats, by a strategic movement on the 6th of Sep
</p>
<p>tember 1861, he advanced up to the mouth of the Tennessee river, and
</p>
<p>occupied Paducah ; he sent on the same day the gunboat Conestoga up
</p>
<p>the Tennessee river, capturing three rebel steamers ; and on the 25th of
</p>
<p>the same month, by the same sagacity and foresight, Smithland, at the
</p>
<p>mouth of the Cumberland was captured, and both rivers blockaded. This
</p>
<p>was the first development of military abUity, coupled with success, made
</p>
<p> in the West.
</p>
<p>From Cairo General Grant sent out expeditions in different directions.
</p>
<p>About the middle of October 1861, Colonel Plummer, commanding the
</p>
<p>11th Missouri Volunteers, went towards Cape Girardeau in pursuit of
</p>
<p>Jeff. Thompson, who was reported to be at Fredricktown ; here a little
</p>
<p>beyond the town, the rebels were found drawn up inline of battle. With
</p>
<p>the assistance of Colonel Carlins; Plummer fought the battle of Frederick-
</p>
<p>town, defeating the rebels, capturing one piece of artillery, and a num
</p>
<p>ber of prisoners.
</p>
<p>Cairo now became an important position. The expedition against Bel
</p>
<p>mont and Columbus was followed up early in November 1861. At the
</p>
<p>battle of Belmont, General Grant had his horse shot under him ; he
</p>
<p>was amid all the scenes of danger, riding from point to point, cheering
</p>
<p>on his men. The bravery displayed by aU on that occasion, wiU be seen
</p>
<p>by the foUowing, read to the troops on their return to Cairo :
</p>
<p>"Head-quarters, District S. E. Mo.
</p>
<p>" Cairo, November 8th, 1861.
</p>
<p>' ' The General commanding this military district returns his thanks to
</p>
<p>the troops under his command at the battle of Belmont on yesterday.
</p>
<p>' ' It has been his fortune to have been in all the battles fought in Mexi
</p>
<p>co by Generals Scott and Taylor, save Buena Vista, and he never saw one
</p>
<p>more hotly contested or where troops behaved with more gallantry.
</p>
<p>" Such courage wiU insure victory wherever our flag may be borne and
</p>
<p>protected by such a class of men.
</p>
<p>" To the brave who feU, the sympathy of the country is due, and will
</p>
<p>be manifested in a manner unmistakable. "U. S.Grant,

<p>to retire behind the batteries at Columbus, about eight miles below Cairo.
</p>
<p>Generals Paine,, and C. F. Smith were_also on the march to. ascertain ex
</p>
<p>actly the enemy's position and numbers. After a week's absence each
</p>
<p>commander returned. to bisi former post. ,
</p>
<p>The time had now come for an advance into iiome of the strongholds
</p>
<p>of the enemy. Fort Henry on :the Tennessee river, near the boundary
</p>
<p>Une between that state and -Kentucky, the expedition arriving near the
</p>
<p>mouth, on the 5th of February, 1862, General Grant issued his order
</p>
<p>directing his. mode- of attack.
</p>
<p>Towards noon of the 6th, the troops commenced, according to instruc
</p>
<p>tions, their, advance upon the works. After a little aver an haul's engage
</p>
<p>ment the enemy lowered his colors aad surrendered to Flag Officer Foote,
</p>
<p>who soon after passed the captured fortifications, including General
</p>
<p>Lloyd Tilghman, and its guns, to General Grant.
</p>
<p>Fort Donaldson, a very strong rebel position on the Cumberland river,
</p>
<p>was General Grant's next move ; and on the 11th of February, he issued
</p>
<p>an- order, having sent back. to Cairo for some reinforcements. On the
</p>
<p>12th, General McClernand, C. F.Smith, and Lew Wallace, with their
</p>
<p>troops commenced the advance. At noon on that day the enemy's pick
</p>
<p>ets were driven in. The next day, the 13th, was occupied principally by
</p>
<p>getting into -position and waiting for the gunboats to arrive from Cairo
</p>
<p>with reinforcements. The gunboats had an important part to play in
</p>
<p>making the assault; at two o'clock on the afternoon of the 14th, the
</p>
<p>gunboats and reinforcements having arrived, the Carondelet had been
</p>
<p>attacking the Fort for about two hours on the 13th, but was compeUed
</p>
<p>to withdraw for repairs. Six of the, arrived vessels now moved up the
</p>
<p>river, receiving the fire of the lower batteries of the enemy. At
</p>
<p>seven minutes to three on the 14th, the St. Louis opened lire, and kept it
</p>
<p>up with great spirit until about half past four o'clock. The irondads

<p>-ofthe Union line near the river below .the Fort was furiously attacked by

<p>,the rebels. The Eighth and Forty-first lUinois Regiments were the most

</p>
<p>overpowered by numbers, the Union forces were forced to fallback.
</p>
<p>The eneihy grew bold at his seeming success. The Union regiments
</p>
<p>under Colonel Cruft, and Colonel Wallace's brigade came up, but the en
</p>
<p>emy was so elated with his expeeted victory, that he made a deff-
</p>
<p>perate charge which caused the Union troops to give way for the mo
</p>
<p>ment, although at another point of attack the enemy Were being di-iven
</p>
<p>in. General Grant saw the position here, and hastened to meet it. Gen
</p>
<p>eral Smith was ordered to assault the left of the line, and carry the posi
</p>
<p>tion at aU hazards, while vigorous preparations were made to renew the
</p>
<p>contest oh the right, and recover the ground lost in the morning. Gener
</p>
<p>al Smith ordered tiie Third brigade bf his division, embracing the 7th,
</p>
<p>50th, and 42d Illinois ^ the 12th Iowa, and 13th Missouri, to move against
</p>
<p>one portion of the enemy's Unes, while with the Fourth brigade, embra
</p>
<p>cing the -2d, 7th, and 14th Iowa, and 25th Indiana Regiments, led on by
</p>
<p>him in person against another part of the works. The 2d Iowa led, fol
</p>
<p>lowed by the 52d Indiana, while the sharpshooters Were deployed on
</p>
<p>either flank as skirmishers. In this position the column moved on with
</p>
<p>out firing a gun, carrying the position at the point of the bayonet. This
</p>
<p>great Union sueeess gave the troops new eourag'e along the entire lines.
</p>
<p>Soon after the Fifth brigade, the 8th Missouri, and 11th Indiana, were
</p>
<p>thrown by Colonel Smith against the enemy's position oh the extreme
</p>
<p>right of the line from where the Union troops had been driven in the
</p>
<p>morning. Colonel Cruft was moved to his support ; the assault was made
</p>
<p>in two columns, and the hill was carried by storm. This was the
</p>
<p>position on the evening 'of the 15th. On the morning of the l'6th,
</p>
<p>the enemy displayed a white Hag, proposing to surrender the Fort  but
</p>
<p>the rebel S. B. Buckher requested an armistice of twelve hours to agree
</p>
<p>on the terms of capitulation. General Grant's reply was: "No terms
</p>
<p>other than an unconditional and immediate surrender can be accepted.
</p>
<p>I propose to move immediately upon your works. ' ' U. &. Grant.
</p>
<p>Buckner acceeded to the terms, and the capture of Fort Donaldson was
</p>
<p>made complete. Union loss in the engagement was 446 kiUed, 1735 wound
</p>
<p>ed, and 150 prisoners. Rebel loss 231 kiUed, 1700 wounded, and nearly
</p>
<p>14,000 prisoners, including Buckner, 48 cannon, and 17 heavy guns ;
</p>
<p>20,000stand of arms, 3000 horses, and any quantity of commissary stores.

<p>258 LIEUTENANT GENERAL GRANT.
</p>
<p>General HaUeck at this time issuedan order creating the new district
</p>
<p>of West Tennessee, embracing the country between the Tennessee and
</p>
<p>Mississippi' rivers to the Mississippi State line and Cairo. ' On the 17th
</p>
<p>February, 1862, General Grant issued his order taking command. After
</p>
<p>the occupation of Nashville by General Nelson on February 24th, General
</p>
<p>Grant moved his headquarters to Fort Henry where he spent some days
</p>
<p>in fitting out another expedition. Although great and important events
</p>
<p>had just taken place on the Tennes&ee and Cumberland, yet a mightier was
</p>
<p>at'hand. The capture of the two strong outposts, Henry and Donaldson, on
</p>
<p>the border, served to rouse and call the more desperate and confident
</p>
<p>foe from his hiding-place in the interior. General Beauregard had as
</p>
<p>sembled a strong rebel force at Corinth, 92 miles east of Memphis at the
</p>
<p>junction of the Mobile and Ohio, and Memphis and Charleston railroads.
</p>
<p>General Johnston who was at Murfreesboro, immediately started for Cor*-
</p>
<p>inth and joined Beauregard. On April the 1st, here was assembled the
</p>
<p>strongest foroe; the South had yet gathered on any battle-field. The
</p>
<p>South dreaded an invasion from the Union army victorious, and then
</p>
<p>resting in West Tennessee, and to prevent it, gathered an army of near
</p>
<p>60,000 men, under the command of Albert Sidney Johnston. Johnston
</p>
<p>drew to his assistance such men as Beauregard, Polk, Bragg, Hardee,
</p>
<p>Crittenden, and Breckenridge. With such an array of rebel comman
</p>
<p>ders, urged on by the desperate emergency of the occasion, being
</p>
<p>sent there to prevent the invasion of the cotton States and to meet this
</p>
<p>great array of ability and strength, Major General Grant had about 38,000
</p>
<p>anen, with McClearnand, W. H. S. WaUace, Lewis Wallace, Hurlburt,
</p>
<p>W. T. Sherman, as division commanders, and the gunboats Tyler, Cap
</p>
<p>tain Gwin, and Lexington, Captain Shirk commanding. This was the
</p>
<p>.status on the third of April. Johnston had postponed the attack until the
</p>
<p>fith, waiting till the arrival of additional reinforcements.
</p>
<p>General Buell's forces had been ordered from Nashville to assist the
</p>
<p>Union army, and were hastening up, but before they arrived, Johnston at
</p>
<p>six o'clock on the morning of the 6th of April, pushed his advanced guard
</p>
<p>up to the 25th Missouri regiment, under Prentiss. They supposing the
</p>
<p>advance to be the enemy's pickets, commenced to drive them back. The
</p>
<p>rebels being ready, soon advanced in great force against the left wing,

<p>pouring the grape and cannister and sheU into the Union camp. The boys
</p>
<p>soon organized and commenced to return the compliment, when the
</p>
<p>rebel force beoame directed against the left centre, Sherman's division
</p>
<p>driving the men back from their camps. The rebels now with a fresh
</p>
<p>force opened fire on the left wing, under General McClearnand. The
</p>
<p>fire was returned with great bravery and deadly effect by both artillery
</p>
<p>and infantry along the whole line  a distance of about four miles.
</p>
<p>| General Hurlburt's division was thrown forward to support the centre,
</p>
<p>BATTLE OF CORINTH. 259
</p>
<p>when a desperate conflict ensued. The rebels were driven back with
</p>
<p>terrible slaughter, when they ralhed and in turn drove our men back.
</p>
<p>The contest raged fearfully, the rebel commanders hurling their forces at
</p>
<p>one time against the extreme left, then against the right, and then with
</p>
<p>renewed ferocity against the centre. Major Taylor's Chicago artillery
</p>
<p>raked the rebels down by scores, but the smoke no sooner cleared
</p>
<p>away than the breach would be again fiUed. Late in the afternoon
</p>
<p>the rebels saw General Buell approaching with 18,000 fresh troops.
</p>
<p>He was yet on the opposite side of the Tennessee river, and they knew
</p>
<p>their chances of success were extremely doubtful if his troops effected a
</p>
<p>crossing. General Wallace was only about six miles down the river at
</p>
<p>Camp Landing ; although the boats were sent to bring him and his com
</p>
<p>mand up, yet he had not arrived at five o'clock. The rebel commanders
</p>
<p>comprehending the position, made a furious attack on the left wing,
</p>
<p>driving it back so as to occupy over two-thirds of its camp, and were
</p>
<p>fighting with a dreadful degree of confidence in driving the Union army 
</p>
<p>back into the river. At the same time they were heavily engaging our
</p>
<p>right. In the meantime General Buell's forces were on the opposite bank
</p>
<p>of the river anxious to take part in the struggle ; but the principal part
</p>
<p>of the transport boats having been sent to Savannah there was no means
</p>
<p>at his command by which he could cross the river during that day's en
</p>
<p>gagement. General Grant, with his staff who had been recklessly riding along the
</p>
<p>lines during the entire day amid the unceasing storm of buUets, grape,
</p>
<p>and sheU, now late in the evening rode from right to left urging the men
</p>
<p>to stand firm until reinforcement could be got across the river. Just be
</p>
<p>fore night closed in, a general cannonading was opened upon the enemy
</p>
<p>upon our whole hne. Such a roar of artillery had then never been heard
</p>
<p>on this continent. As the evening grew dark the reply of the rebels be
</p>
<p>came less frequent. The gunboats Lexington and Tyler had been raining
</p>
<p>shell on the rebel hordes. This last effort was too much, for them
</p>
<p>to stand, and about dark their firing had nearly ceased. Thus ended the
</p>
<p>conflict on the evening of the 6th. The rebels had spent their fury in
</p>
<p>order to destroy Grant's army before the reinforcements under Generals
</p>
<p>BueU and WaUace which they knew were coming and already now ad
</p>
<p>vancing, could arrive. But they failed to accomplish it.

<p>ful work of death and carnage:
</p>
<p>The Union forces rested bh th'eif arms in the position they held when
</p>
<p>darkness set in. During Sunday night the reinforcements of BueU and

<p>venge deepened from disappointment ; with this feeling they urged their

</p>
<p>on the right, when they were making a last desperate effort tO flank the

</p>
<p>he again commenced to drive the enemy. About, three o'clock in the
</p>
<p>afternoon General Grant rode to the left, where he had ordered fresh regi
</p>
<p>ments, finding the rebels wavering, sent a portion of his bodyguard to
</p>
<p>the head of each of five regiments, then ordered a charge across the field,
</p>
<p>himself leading and far in the advance brandishing his sword, waved, them on
</p>
<p>to the crowning victory, the cannon balls falling like hail around him.
</p>
<p>His men followed with a shout that rose above the roar and din of
</p>
<p>artillery, the rebels fleeing in dismay as from a destroying avalanche,
</p>
<p>and never made another stand. By five o'clock the entire rebel army
</p>
<p>was in full retreat to Corinth, with our army in hot pursuit.
</p>
<p>Some have supposed that Grant's battle-ground was not well chosen,
</p>
<p>with the Tennessee river in his rear. General BueU said to him, " Sup
</p>
<p>pose you had been whipped, you had transports only sufficient to cross
</p>
<p>over about 10,000 men." " Well," says the great chieftain, " if I had
</p>
<p>been whipped, that would have been, abundant for all that would have
</p>
<p>been left of us." *
</p>
<p>From the 8th to the 13th of April, the army under command of General
</p>
<p>Halleck, continued to pursue the enemy to Monterey, Pea Ridge, Putdy,
</p>
<p>arriving within a few miles of Corinth where Beauregard had retreated
</p>
<p>and concentrated his forces to make another stand. The Union army
</p>
<p>was now reorganizing, and General Grant placed second in command.
</p>
<p>The army of the Tennessee (right) under General Grant ; the army of the
</p>
<p>Mississippi (left) under General Pope ; and the army of the Ohio (centre)
</p>
<p>under General BueU. Abput this time an effort was made by rival mili
</p>
<p>tary aspirants, and their satellites, to bring General Grant info disrepute
</p>
<p>by criticizing his military capacity and charging him with dissipation ;
</p>
<p>but a timely exposure of their malicious designs, by the Hon. E. B-Wash-
</p>
<p>burne, of Illinois, in an able speech delivered in the United States House
</p>
<p>of Representatives May 2d, 1862, checkmated their game. On the 27th
</p>
<p>Sherman, Thomas, BueU, and Pope, under the special direction of Gen

<p>eral Grant made a reconnoisance within gunshot of the rebel works at

<p>Corinth. While General Grant was preparing for a siege, Beauregard on

<p>the 30th evacuated the place, retreating by way of Baldwin and Tupelo.

<p>of a naval engagement in front of the place on the 6th day of June. New

<p>sion of the Federal forces.
</p>
<p>On the 17th of July, 1862, General Halleck took leave of his army pre
</p>
<p>paratory to assuming a more exalted position. The department was now
</p>
<p>subdivided, and under the command of different generals. The depart

<p>ment of West Tennessee was assigned to General Grant, with Corinth as

<p>his headquarters. Very little was done in a mihtary way except a f<e,w

<p>skirmishes, which always resulted favorable to the Union troops, until
</p>
<p>the middle of September, when the rebel generals were organizing at
</p>
<p>Iuka and other points to break through the Union lines and retake the
</p>
<p>conquered territory. Van sDorn was to remain to defend Vicksburg.
</p>
<p>Breckenridge was to make his way into Kentucky, and Price to go to
</p>
<p>Tennessee. THE BATTLE OF IUKA.
</p>
<p>General Grant says : " On the 16th of September we commenced to
</p>
<p>collect our strength to move upon Price, atfiluka, in two columns ; the
</p>
<p>one to the right of the railroad commanded by Brigadier General (now
</p>
<p>Major-General) W. S. Rosecrans ; the one to the left commanded by
</p>
<p>Major General E. 0. C. Ord. On the night of the 18th, the latter was in
</p>
<p>position to bring on an engagement in one hour',8 march. The former,
</p>
<p>from having a greater distance to march, and, through the fault of a
</p>
<p>guide, was twenty miles back. On the 19th, by making a rapid march,
</p>
<p>hardy, well-disciplined, and tried troops arrived within two miles of tho
</p>
<p>place to be attacked. Unexpectedly the enemy took the initiative and
</p>
<p>became the attacking party. The ground chosen was such that a large
</p>
<p>force on our side could not be brought into action ; but the bravery and
</p>
<p>endurance of those brought in was such that, with the skill and presence
</p>
<p>of mind of the officer commanding, they were able to hold their ground
</p>
<p>till night closed the conflict. During the night the enemy fled, leaving
</p>
<p>our troops in possession of the field,with their dead to bury and wounded
</p>
<p>to care for. If it was the object of the enemy to make their way into
</p>
<p>Kentucky : they were .defeated in that ; if to hold their position until Van
</p>
<p>Dorn could come up on the southwest of Corinth, and make a simulta
</p>
<p>neous attack, they were defeated in that. Our only defeat was in not
</p>
<p>capturing the entire army, or ih destroying it, as I had hoped to do.
</p>
<p>"' It was a part of General Hamilton's command that did the fighting,
</p>
<p>directed entirely by that cool and deserving officer. I commend him to
</p>
<p>the President for acknowledgment of his services."
</p>
<p>This battle of Iuka was a part of the battle of Corinth. The rebel Gen.
</p>
<p>Price suppose* that Gen. Grant would have been compelled to with
</p>
<p>draw his forces from Corinth on the 19th of September, to assist those
</p>
<p>who were collecting at Iuka. The rebel Gen. Van Dorn was waiting for
</p>
<p>the move, but*Gen. Grant understood their game, and sent Gen. Ord to

</p>
<p>that point.
</p>
<p>The rebel armies of Van Dorn and Price, under Gen. Van Dorn, formed
</p>
<p>a juncture at Ripley, and commenced to march on Corinth. October

<p>phis and Charleston railroad, thus moving from the west on Corinth.
</p>
<p>BATTLE OF CORINTH. 263
</p>
<p>Gen. Grant, awaTe of the enemy's movements on the morning of Friday,
</p>
<p>October 3d , had sent a large force some miles in front of his intrenched
</p>
<p>works, to meet him. At 7 o'clock, A. M., the rebel Gen. Lovell's divis
</p>
<p>ion, with Gen. ViUipigue's artiUery, opened fire. It was not Gen.
</p>
<p>Grant's plan to continue the struggle so far from his fortifications, there
</p>
<p>fore the Union forces fell back to within one mile of their entrenched
</p>
<p>works, when, at half-past nine o'clock, a severe engagement took place.
</p>
<p>The Union forces were now ordered to fall back into the fortifications,
</p>
<p>which they did handsomely, and brought up several heavy field guns
</p>
<p>and opened a galhng and destructive fire on the enemy's advance.
</p>
<p>This retiring behind the entrenchments caused the rebel Gen. Van
</p>
<p>Dorn, (who little understood their strength,) to dispatch on Friday night
</p>
<p>to Richmond news that he had won a great victory.
</p>
<p>On the morning of the 4th, Van Dorn continued in supreme command.
</p>
<p>Geru Price commanded the left wing, and Gen. Lovell the right wing,
</p>
<p>which was stationed west of Corinth, and just south of the Memphis and
</p>
<p>Charleston railroad. The battle was commenced by Gen. Price half an
</p>
<p>hour before daylight, within a few hundred yards of the Union breast
</p>
<p>works. Heavy skirmishing was kept up along the line until 10, A. M.
</p>
<p>About this time one portion of the rebel lines broke, running pell-mell
</p>
<p>into Corinth, losing all semblance of order, infantry and cavahy being
</p>
<p>crowded together in one dense mass, wild with excitement.
</p>
<p>But the batteries, under the orders of the Union general, had been
</p>
<p>so placed as to command the vUIage, as well as the approaches to it.
</p>
<p>AU the Union guns now opened on this disorganized rebel mob, who
</p>
<p>were cut down by thousands, almost swept from the face of the earth.
</p>
<p>Van Dorn here began to understand that his supposed victory would re
</p>
<p>sult in disastrous and disgraceful defeat. A lodgment in the village was
</p>
<p>out of the question, therefore he moved in single columns, eight deep, and
</p>
<p>moved in silenee to assault the battery on CoUege Hill, which was his
</p>
<p>forlorn hope. After being several times repulsed by the brave Union
</p>
<p>troops, at last additional guns were brought to bear, and a murderous
</p>
<p>fire opened on the rebels which nothing human could stand ; the few
</p>
<p>that were left alive became confused, and fled in wild dismay from the
</p>
<p>vortex of death. At 3 P. M. , the rebel army had fallen back in great

<p>confusion. The rebel loss, in killed, wounded and prisoners, was over
</p>
<p>10,000 men, 4000 stand of arms, and two pieces of artillery.
</p>
<p>Gen. Grant says : " Head-Quarters, Department op West Tenn.,
</p>
<p>" Jackson, Tenn., October 1th, 1862.

<p>"It is with heartful gratitude the General Commanding congratulates

<p>4th, and 5th instants, over the comhined armies of Van Darn, Pricey
</p>
<p>and IfOyell.
</p>
<p>" The enemy chose his, own time and plan of attack, and knowing the
</p>
<p>troops of the West as. he does, and with great facilities for knnwing, their/
</p>
<p>numbers, never would have made the attempt except with a superior force
</p>
<p>numerically. But for the undaunted bravery of officers and soldiers.^
</p>
<p>who have yet to learn defeat, the efforts of the enemy must have proves
</p>
<p>successful. " Whilst one division of the army, under Major-General Rospcrans,
</p>
<p>was resisting and repelling the onslaught of the rebel hos,ts at Corinth,
</p>
<p>another from Bolivar, under Majr-Ceneral Hurlbut, was marching upon
</p>
<p>the enemy's rear, deriving in their pickets and cavalry, and attracting
</p>
<p>the attention of a large force of infantry and artillery. On the following
</p>
<p>day, under Major-General Ord, these forces advanced with unsurpassed
</p>
<p>gallantry, driving the enetny back across the Hatchie, over ground
</p>
<p>where it is almost incredible that a superior force should be driven by
</p>
<p>an inferior, capturing two of the batteries (eight guns), many hundred
</p>
<p>small arms, and several hundred prisoners.
</p>
<p>" To those two divisions of the army all praise is due, and wiU be,
</p>
<p>awarded by a grateful country."
</p>
<p>The rebel army retreated, crossing the Hatchie River, and halting q$
</p>
<p>a point a little north of Ripley. On the 16th pf October, 1862, General
</p>
<p>Grant's department was extended so as, to, embrace the State of Missis-
</p>
<p>sipi as far north as Vicksburg, and he issued an order to that efi'ept dated
</p>
<p>Jackson, Tenn., October 25th, 1662. Galveston, Texas, ha 1 been cap^
</p>
<p>tured by the naval force on the 9th of October ; these, with defeate in

<p>Tennessee, began to tell on the nervous rebel leaders when they saw
</p>
<p>388 vessels of war, mounting 3072, nearly nine to the vessel, and among

<p>these, thirty iron clads, mounting ninety of the heayest guns in the.
</p>
<p>world, each weighing 42,240 pounds, and throwing a spJid shot" fifteen
</p>
<p>inches in diameter, weighing 480, pounds. All eyes were now turned on

<p>East Tennessee and Vicksburg, as. the next important positions. T,he

<p>rebel government had entrusted Vicksburg to Gen. Pembprton, and, in-,

<p>structed Van Brn and Price, to render him, all assistance possible. Gen.

<p>tha^ President Lincoln issued his famous Emancipation Proclamation.
</p>
<p>'On the 29th of January, 1863, Grant moved his headquarters to. Milliken's
</p>
<p>Bend ; from this position he intended to flank the works upon the south
</p>
<p>side of the city ; an effort was also made to re-open the canal across the
</p>
<p>\ peninsula, on the Louisiana side of the river, first commenced by Gen.
</p>
<p>Williams, a gaUant officer, who. was subsequently killed at Beaton Rouge.

<p>Charles R. Ellet, ran past the batteries at; Vicksburg, and after proceed
</p>
<p>ing up Red River and capturing a large amount of valuable stores, and
</p>
<p>one steamer, coming in contact with three rebel armed steamers, the pir .
</p>
<p>lot of the Queen ran her aground ha easy range of their guns, and Col.
</p>
<p>EUet was forced^ tp abandon her. The gunboat Indianola had also ran
</p>
<p>past the batteries, but on the night of the 24th was met and captured by
</p>
<p>the rebel fleet, but she sank before her captors could get possession of her.
</p>
<p>On the 21st ef March, 1863, Admiral Farragut's flag-ship, the Hartford,
</p>
<p>which with the Albatrose (two out of the six that started ,) had succeeded
</p>
<p>in running past the batteries at Port Hudson,  this port is situated about
</p>
<p>sixteen miles above Baton Rouge, and 300 belpw Vicksburg,  arrived
</p>
<p>below Vicksburg, and the Admiral communicated with Gen. Grant.
</p>
<p>Four days later the Union rams Lancaster and Switzerland attempted to
</p>
<p>pass the Vicksburg batteries, but the former was sunk, and the latter
</p>
<p>disabled by the rebel guns. Qn the 29th of March part of the Union
</p>
<p>army captured, after twp hours' fighting, the town of Richmond, La.
</p>
<p>Admiral Porter, with a number of gunbpats and other vessels, began
</p>
<p>transporting the army across the Mississippi. On the night of the 16th of
</p>
<p>April the vessels succeeded in running the gauntjet, and one week after
</p>
<p>wards the transports, loaded with troops, also made the perilous trip.
</p>
<p>Colonel (now General) B. H. Grierson, of the first cavalry brigade, was
</p>
<p>detailed by Grant to cut all the enemy's communications with Vicksburg.
</p>
<p>Col. Grierson having destroyed bridges, railroads, locomotives, and
</p>
<p>every communication, and having routed the enemy wherever encoun-
</p>
<p>ered, arrived at Baton Rouge on the 1st of May.
</p>
<p>It was Gen. Grant's intention to circumvent the defences pf Vicksburg.
</p>
<p>First, by the canal across the isthmus opposite the city ; second, by the
</p>
<p>effort to get through the Vazoo Pass ; third, the Lake Providence canal
</p>
<p>project. It was his aim to get in the rear or below Vicksburg, but the
</p>
<p>natural difficulties were too great to be successfully overcome. The
</p>
<p>rebel fortifications at Snyder's Bluff, on the Yazoo, or his batteries in
</p>
<p>front of the city, were about the only points susceptible pf assault.
</p>
<p>On the nights of the 16th and 22d of April, 1863, two fleets of gun-
</p>
<p>bpats and transpprts ran past the rebel batteries at Vicksburg without
</p>
<p>receiving material damage. From the 22d of December, 1862, the cap

<p>ture of Vicksburg became a necessity, and from that day until the 4th of
</p>
<p>July, 1863, its entrenchment? and garrison had little rpst ; its besieger
</p>
<p>knowing no such word as fail, applied every means to overcome the dif
</p>
<p>ficulties that nature and art had thrown in the way of its capture.
</p>
<p>Through all these long, dreary months Gen. Grant continued, with hig
</p>
<p>brave army, to persevere, and every obstacle was finally overequip. Up
</p>
<p>to the 22d of May all the combinations were so arranged as to carry the
</p>
<p>place by assault, but the developments of that day's fighting cenyinced

</p>
<p>the commanding General that that mode of capture would be attended
</p>
<p>with too great a waste of life. From that day Gen. Grant determined to
</p>
<p>capture the place by a regular siege. He brought on more troops, which
</p>
<p>enabled him to make, the investment more complete, and give him a
</p>
<p>chance to keep a large reserve to watch the movements of the rebel Gen.
</p>
<p>Johnston, who was then gathering a force in Grant's rear, threatening to
</p>
<p>compel him to raise the siege.
</p>
<p>" On the afternoon of the third of July a letter was received from Lieu-
</p>
<p>tenant-General Pemberton, commanding the confederate forces at Vicks
</p>
<p>burg, proposing an armistice, and the appointment of commissioners to
</p>
<p>arrange terms for the capitulation of the place. The correspondence,
</p>
<p>copies of which are herewith transmitted, resulted in the surrender of
</p>
<p>the city and garrison of Vicksburg at ten o'clock a. m. , July fourth, 1863,
</p>
<p>on the following terms ; ' The entire garrison, officers and men, were to
</p>
<p>be paroled, not to take up arms against the United States until exchanged
</p>
<p>by the proper authorities ; officers and men each to be furnished with a
</p>
<p>parole, signed by himself; officers to be allowed their side-arms and
</p>
<p>private baggage, and the field, staff, and cavalry officers one horse each ;
</p>
<p>the rank and file to be allowed all their clothing, but no other property ;
</p>
<p>rations from their own stores sufficient to last them beyond our lines ; the
</p>
<p>necessary cooking utensils for preparing their#food ; and thirty wagons to
</p>
<p>transport such articles as could not well be carried. These terms I re
</p>
<p>garded more favorable to the Government than an unccnditiPnal surren
</p>
<p>der. It saved us the transportation of them North, which at time would
</p>
<p>have been very difficult, owing to the limited amount of river transportation
</p>
<p>on hand, and the expense of subsisting them. It left our army free to
</p>
<p>to operate against Johnston, who threatened us from the direction of
</p>
<p>Jackson ; and our river transportation to be used for the movement of
</p>
<p>troops to any point the exigency of the service might require.
</p>
<p>" I deem it proper to state here, in Order that the correspondence may
</p>
<p>be fully understood, that after my answer to General Pemberton's letter
</p>
<p>of the morning of the third, we had a personal interview on the subject

<p>The following account of the interview between the generals com

<p>manding the opposite armies, is given by an eye-witness :

</p>
<p>" At three o'clock precisely, one gun, the pre-arranged signal, was
</p>
<p>fired, and immediately replied to by the enemy. General Pemberton
</p>
<p>then made his appearance on the works in Mc Pherson's front, under a
</p>
<p>white flag, considerably on the left of what is known as Fort Hill. Gen
</p>
<p>eral Grant rode through our trenches until he came to an outlet, leading
</p>
<p>to a small green space, which had not been trod by either army.
</p>
<p>Here he dismounted, and advanced to meet General Pemberton, with
</p>
<p>whom he shook hands, and greeted famdiarly.
</p>
<p>" It was beneath the outspreading branches of a gigantic cak that the
</p>
<p>conference bf the generals took place. Here presented the only space
</p>
<p>which had not been used for some purpose or other by the contending
</p>
<p>armies. The ground was covered with a fresh luxuriant verdure ; here
</p>
<p>and there a shrub or clump of bushes could be seen standing out from
</p>
<p>the green growth on the surface, while several oaks filled up the scene,
</p>
<p>and gave it character. Some of the trees in their tops exhibited the
</p>
<p>effects of flying projectiles, by the loss of Umbs or torn foliage, and in
</p>
<p>their trunks the indentations of smaller missiles plainly marked- the oc
</p>
<p>currences to which they had been sUent witnesses.
</p>
<p>" The party made up to take part in the conference was composed as
</p>
<p>follows : "United States Officers.
</p>
<p>" Major-General U. S. Grant.
</p>
<p>" Major-General James B. McPherson.
</p>
<p>" Brigadier -General A. J. Smith.
</p>
<p>LIEUTENANT GENERAL GRANT.
</p>
<p>"Rebel Offers.
</p>
<p>"Lieutenant-General Jphn C. Pemberton.
</p>
<p>" Major-General Bpwen.
</p>
<p>", Colonel Montgomery, A- A.-G. to General Pemberton.
</p>
<p>" When Generals Grant and Pemberton met they shook hands, Colonel
</p>
<p>Mpntgomery introducing the party. A short silence ensued, at the ex
</p>
<p>piration of which General Pemberton remarked :
</p>
<p>?' ' General Grant, I meet ypu in order to arrange terms for the capit
</p>
<p>ulation of the city of Vicksburg and its garrison. What terms do you
</p>
<p>demand?' 
</p>
<p>" ' Unconditional surrender,' replied General Grant.
</p>
<p>" ' Unconditional surrender!' said Pemberton. ' Never, so long as I
</p>
<p>have a man left me ! I will fight rather.'
</p>
<p>" ' Then sir you can continue the defence/ cooly said General Grant.
</p>
<p>My army has never been in a better condition for the prosecution of a
</p>
<p>siege." " During the passing of these few preliminaries, General Pemberton
</p>
<p>was greatly agitated, quaking from head to foot, while General Grant
</p>
<p>experienced all his natural self-possesaion, and evinced not the least sign
</p>
<p>of embarrassment.
</p>
<p>" After a short conversation standing, by a kind of mutual tendency
</p>
<p>the two general's wandered off from the rest of the party and seated
</p>
<p>themselves on the grass, in a cluster of bushes, where alone they talked
</p>
<p>over the important events then pending. General Grant could be seen,
</p>
<p>even at that distance, talking cooly, occasionally giving a few puffs at his
</p>
<p>favorite companion  his black cigar. General Mc Pherson, General A. J.
</p>
<p>Smith, General Boweu, and Colonel Montgomery, imitating the example
</p>
<p>of the commanding generals, seated themselves at some distance off, while
</p>
<p>the respective staffs of the generals formed another and larger group in
</p>
<p>the rear.
</p>
<p>" After a lengthy conversation the generals separated. General Pem
</p>
<p>berton did not come to any conclusion on the matter, but stated his in
</p>
<p>tention to submit the matter to a council of general officers of his com
</p>
<p>mand; and, in the event of their assent, the surrender of the city should
</p>
<p>be made in the morning. Until morning was given him to consider, to
</p>
<p>determine upon the matter, and send in his final reply. The generals now

</p>
<p>rode to their respective quarters."
</p>
<p>The same correspondent, under date of July 4th, 1863, writes as fol
</p>
<p>lows :
</p>
<p>"Having a few hours leisure this morning, prior to the arrival pf the
</p>
<p>despatch from General Pemberton, stating he was ready to surrender, I
</p>
<p>took occasion to visit General Grant, and found everybody about his
</p>
<p>battle Of Vicksburg. 269
</p>
<p>head-quarters in a state of the liveliest satisfaction. It was evident the
</p>
<p>glorious events Pf the day Were duly appreciated.
</p>
<p>" The General I found in conversation more animated than I have ever
</p>
<p>known him. He is evidently contented with the manner in which he has
</p>
<p>acquitted himself of the responsible task which has for more than five
</p>
<p>months engrossed his mind and liis army. The consummation is one of
</p>
<p>which he may well be preud. Frpm Bruinshurg to Vicksburg, nineteen
</p>
<p>days, presents one Pf the most active records of marches, actions, and
</p>
<p>victories of the war. All the combined operations of our armies, for a
</p>
<p>similiar length of time, can not equal it. It is unparalleled, the only
</p>
<p>campaign of the war which has involved celerity of movement, attack,
</p>
<p>victory, pursuit, and the annihilation of the enemy."
</p>
<p>On the 8th of July, Port Hudson was surrendered to General Banks
</p>
<p>with 51 pieces of artillery, 5,000 stand of arms, a large quantity of am
</p>
<p>munition and -stores, and nearly 6 000 men and offieei-s, including two
</p>
<p>Generals. The capture of Vicksburg was a victory fruitful of great re
</p>
<p>sults ; it opened the Mississippi river, and its navigation has contimied un
</p>
<p>interrupted (except by a few guerillas) along the b itire course of that
</p>
<p>stream from St. Lonis to its mouth until the present time.
</p>
<p>General Grant, for his great services, was how October 16, 1B63, ap
</p>
<p>pointed Major General in the regular army, his commission to date July
</p>
<p>4th, 1863. The officers under his command also presented him with a
</p>
<p>magnificent sword. At Memphis, New Orleans, and Indianapolis, he re
</p>
<p>ceived the congratulations cf his countrymen. The departments of the
</p>
<p>Ohio, of the Cumberland, and of the Tennessee, were constituted by
</p>
<p>order of President Lincoln into one military division, to be called " The
</p>
<p>Military Division of the Mississippi, and Major General Grant appointed
</p>
<p>to take command of the same. This hew command embraced the states
</p>
<p>of Michigan, IUinois, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee; Mississippi,
</p>
<p>Northern Alabama, and North-Western Georgia. This gave the com

</p>
<p>dous  tropps frpm all parts pf the rebellious States, where their absence
</p>
<p>from other fields was not detrimental to their infamous cause, having
</p>
<p>been gathered there by General Bragg to thwart the plans of the Union
</p>
<p>commander, and to hold Kentucky and Middle Tennessee. They freely
</p>
<p>acknowledged it was better to " give up the seacoast  better to give up
</p>
<p>the Southwest  better to give up Richmond without a struggle, than
</p>
<p>lose the golden fields whose grain and wool were their sole hope."
</p>
<p>On the 23d of October, 1863, General Grant reached Chattanooga and
</p>
<p>assumed command of the army of the Mississippi. Reinforcements now
</p>
<p>began to arrive, and preparations made for the new campaign.
</p>
<p>Bragg had already commenced the siege, but the tactics of Grant in
</p>
<p>opening river communication with the base of supplies, soon convinced
</p>
<p>Bragg that the garrison could not be starved out ; he also became satis
</p>
<p>fied that Chattanooga could not be captured.
</p>
<p>Thus Bragg was forced to undertake the capture of Knoxville. Burn
</p>
<p>side was holding a line on the Teneessee river, extending from Loudon
</p>
<p>to Kingston, possessing great natural advantages. He informed Grant
</p>
<p>of Longstreet's approach, and also stated that he could prevent him from
</p>
<p>crossing the Tennessee river, but Grant instructed Burnside to make no
</p>
<p>defence of the line but to fall back on Knoxville and stand a siege, prom
</p>
<p>ising to relieve him in a few days. This strategy told Longstreet on
</p>
<p>beyond the reach of supporting Bragg. This divided the rebel army in
</p>
<p>two. Bragg hearing of the approach of General Sherman to Grant's.aid,
</p>
<p>attempted on November 22d, 1863, to abandon his strong position before
</p>
<p>Chattanooga and retire for safety beyond the mountains. Grant was not
</p>
<p>willing to let Bragg off so cheaply, and made a move to detain him, and
</p>
<p>by commencing his operations one day sooner than he intended, compelled
</p>
<p>the rebel leader to remain in his rifle pits and accept battle. This was no
</p>
<p>blind uncertain striking that won the Alma, and Magenta. Grant had de
</p>
<p>termined upon it six days before it was executed, and spent two entire
</p>
<p>days in watching from the very point of the line for the moment at which
</p>
<p>to attempt it. Grant was not only in command of his own army, but the
</p>
<p>enemy's , movements were forced upon him. Every movement of the
</p>
<p>rebel commander may be said to be ordered by Grant. Bragg in the
</p>
<p>command of the rebel army was merely his mouth-piece. Grant's plan

<p>of battle contemplated the breaking of the enemy's center, but it being
</p>
<p>strongly posted on a mountain ridge almost inaccessible, it rendered
</p>
<p>success only possible. Two days labor attacking the flanks weakened
</p>
<p>Bragg's center ; this was what Grant worked for, and when the golden
</p>
<p>moment came, Grant instantly ordered the assault of tho center, which
</p>
<p>resulted in the victory, capturing several thousand prisoners, and sixty
</p>
<p>pieces of artillery. Burnside about the same time defeated Longstreet at

<p>GENERAL MEIGS 's REVIEW OP THE BATTLES.
</p>
<p>Add to this report the one sent to the Secretary of War by Quarter
</p>
<p>master-General Meigs, and we have an accurate and interesting account
</p>
<p>of the great battles.
</p>
<p>General Meigs wrote as foUows :
</p>
<p>" Head-Quarters, Chattanooga, Nov. 26th, 1863.
</p>
<p>" Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War :
</p>
<p>" Sin : On the twenty-third instant, at half-past eleven, a. m., General
</p>
<p>Grant ordered a demonstration against Missionary Ridge, to develop the
</p>
<p>force holding it. The troops marched out, formed in order, and advanced
</p>
<p>in Une of battle as if on parade.
</p>
<p>" The rebels watched the formation and movement from their picket
</p>
<p>Unes and rifle-pits, and from the summits of Missionary Ridge, five hun
</p>
<p>dred feet above us, and thought it was a review and drill, so openly and
</p>
<p>deliberately, so regular was it all done.
</p>
<p>" The line advanced, preceded by skirmishers, and at two o'clock,
</p>
<p>p. m., reached our picket lines, and opened a rattling volley upon the
</p>
<p>the rebel pickets, who replied and ran into their advanced line of rifle-
</p>
<p>pits. After them went our skirmishers and into them, along the centre
</p>
<p>of the line of twenty-five thousand troops which General Thomas had so
</p>
<p>quickly displayed, until we opened fire. Prisoners assert that they
</p>
<p>thought the whole movement was a review and general drill, and that it
</p>
<p>was too late to send to their camps for reinforcements, and that they
</p>
<p>were overwhelmed by force of numbers. It was a surprise in open day-
</p>
<p>Ught. " At three, p. m. , the important advanced position of Orchard Knob
</p>
<p>and the lines right and left were in our possession, and arrangements
</p>
<p>were ordered for holding them during the night.
</p>
<p>' ' The next day at daylight, General Sherman had five thousand men
</p>
<p>across the Tennessee, and established on its south bank, and commenced
</p>
<p>the construction of a pontoon bridge about six miles above Chattanooga.
</p>
<p>The rebel steamer Dunbar was repaired at the right moment, and render

<p>upon the mountain-side showed that picket-skirmishing was going on:
</p>
<p>Then it ceased. A brigade sent from Chattanooga, crossed the Chatta

</p>
<p>and chased them into their intrenchments ; and at the foot of Missionary
</p>
<p>Ridge, Sherman made an assault against Bragg's right, intrenched on a
</p>
<p>high knob next to that on which Sherman himself lay fortified. The
</p>
<p>assault was gallantly made.
</p>
<p>" Sherman reached the edge, of the crest, and held his ground for (it
</p>
<p>seemed to me) an hour, but was bloodily repulsed by reserves.
</p>
<p>" A general advance was ordered, and a strong line of skirmishers fol
</p>
<p>lowed by a deployed line of battle some two miles in length. At the
</p>
<p>signal of leaden shots from head-quarters on Orchard Knob, the Une
</p>
<p>moved rapidly and orderly forward. The rebel pickets discharged their
</p>
<p>muskets and ran into their rifle-pits. Our skirmishers followed on their
</p>
<p>heels. "The line of battle was not far behind, and we saw the gray rebels
</p>
<p>swarm out of the ledge line of rifle-pits and over the base of the hill in
</p>
<p>numbers which surprised us. A few turned and fired their piecos ; but
</p>
<p>the greater number collected into the many roads which cross obliquely
</p>
<p>up its steep face, and went on to the top.
</p>
<p>" Some regiments pressed on and swarmed up the steep sides of the
</p>
<p>Ridge, and here and there a color was advanced beyond the lines. The
</p>
<p>attempt appeared most dangerous ; but the advance was supported, and
</p>
<p>the whole line was ordered to storm the heights, upon which not less
</p>
<p>than forty pieces of artillery, and no one knows how many muskets, stood
</p>
<p>ready to slaughter the assailants. With cheers answering to cheers, the
</p>
<p>men swarmed upward. They gathered to the points least difficult of ac
</p>
<p>cess, and the line was broken. Color after color was planted on the
</p>
<p>summit, while musket and cannon vomited their thunder upon them.
</p>
<p>" A well-directed shot from Orchard Knob exploded a rebel caisson on
</p>
<p>the summit and the gun was seen being speedily taken to the right, its
</p>
<p>driver lashing his horses. A pariy of our soldiers intercepted them, and
</p>
<p>the gun was captured, with cheers.

<p>Thomas and Sherman, a mile or two of the ridge was still occupied by

<p>the rebels.

<p>' ' Some of the captured artillery was put into position. ArtiUerists
</p>
<p>were sent for to work the guns, and caissons were searched for ammu-

</p>
<p>" The other assault to the right of our centre gained the summit, and
</p>
<p>the rebels threw down their arms and fled.
</p>
<p>" Hooker, coming into favorable position, swept the right of the ridge
</p>
<p>and captured many prisoners.
</p>
<p>" Bragg ' s remaining troops left early in the night, and , the battle of
</p>
<p>Chattanooga, after days of manoeuvering and fighting, was won. The
</p>
<p>strength of the rebellion in the centre is broken. Burnside is relieved
</p>
<p>from danger, in East Tennessee. Kentucky and Tennessee are rescued.
</p>
<p>Georgia and the Southeast are threatened in the rear, and another vic
</p>
<p>tory is added to the chapter of ' Unconditional Surrender Grant. '
</p>
<p>" To-night the estimate of captures is several thousand prisoners and
</p>
<p>thirty pieces of artillery.
</p>
<p>" Our loss for so great a victory is not severe.
</p>
<p>"Bragg is firing the raihoad as he retreats towards Dalton. Sherman
</p>
<p>is in hot pursuit.
</p>
<p>" To-day I viewed the battle field, which extends for six miles along
</p>
<p>Missionary Ridge and for several miles on Lookout Mountain.
</p>
<p>"Probably not so well-directed, so well ordered a battle has taken
</p>
<p>place during the war. But one assault was repulsed; but that assault,
</p>
<p>by calling to that point the rebel reserves, prevented them repulsing any
</p>
<p>of the others.
</p>
<p>" A few days since General Bragg sent to General Grant a flag of truce,
</p>
<p>advising him that it would be prudent to remove any non-combatants
</p>
<p>who might be still in Chattanooga. No reply has been returned ; but
</p>
<p>the combatants having removed from this vicinity, it is probable that
</p>
<p>non-combatants can remain without imprudence.

</p>
<p>Thus was the great victory of Chattanooga won. The star of General
</p>
<p>Grant's military fame now rose far above the horizon. He had cap

<p>tured Forts Henry and Donaldson, and opened up the Tennessee and Cum

</p>
<p>balance of the rebel troops to his works at Corinth. On the 29th of
</p>
<p>May, General Grant forced him to evacuate that stronghold. At Iuka,

<p>he again met and defeated the enemy ; Price and Van Dorn, with a large

<p>capture the Union army, as he had before defeated Buckner, Johnston,
</p>
<p>and Beauregard. He now almost annihilates the new combination under
</p>
<p>Van Dorn.* Thus far he had baffled and defeated all the plans of the
</p>
<p>rebel commanders. Pemberton, by holding Vicksburg, blockaded the
</p>
<p>Mississippi river. This great river had to be opened down to the sea,
</p>
<p>and in order to do it, Vicksburg had to be taken. All the rebel troops
</p>
<p>that could be spared were sent to Pemberton to assist in holding the
</p>
<p>place. But after a few months of incessant toil, hard fighting, and dis
</p>
<p>play of generalship the world had never seen, this great stronghold
</p>
<p>was captured^ Port Hudson feU as a consequence, and the great Father
</p>
<p>of Waters now became open, and Uncle Sam's war-dogs of the flood (the
</p>
<p>gunboats) everywhere patroled it, defiantly stopping to show their teeth
</p>
<p>to angry- whipped gueriUas that lurked on its shores ; then came food
</p>
<p>by vessels, and very soon it became the highway for commerce as of
</p>
<p>old, frpm St Lpuis to the Gulf of Mexico.
</p>
<p>Then the great battle of Chattanooga, of which General Halleck re
</p>
<p>marks : " Considering the strength of the rebel position and the difficul
</p>
<p>ty of storming his entrenchments, the battle of Chattanooga must be con
</p>
<p>sidered the most remarkable in history. For General Grant's great ser

<p>vices he received a vote of thanks by the Congress of the United States,
</p>
<p>with appropriations for a gold medal ; and President Lincoln approved
</p>
<p>the resolution, December 17th, 1863.
</p>
<p>This medal on one side presents a profile of the General, surrounded by

<p>which all official communications will be sent, except those from the
</p>
<p>Army where the headquarters are at the date of their address.
</p>
<p>U. S. Grant, Lieutenant-General.1'
</p>
<p>On the 23 of March, 1864, General Grant again arrived at Washington,
</p>
<p>accompanied by his wife and son. Brig. Gen. Rawlings, Col Duff, Maj.
</p>
<p>Rawley, and Capt. Bedeau, of the General's staff, were with him. In a
</p>
<p>few days he had established his headquarters in the Army of the Potomac,
</p>
<p>at Culpepper Court House.
</p>
<p>On the 24th of March, 1864, a re-organization of the Army of the Po
</p>
<p>tomac was effected. The number of army corps were reduced to three ;
</p>
<p>the Second, under cemmand of Major-General Winfield S. Hancock ; the
</p>
<p>Fifth, under command of Major-General G. W. Warren ; and the Sixth,
</p>
<p>under command of General Sedgwick. On the fourth of April, 1864,
</p>
<p>Major-General Sheridan was placed in command of the cavalry corps.
</p>
<p>Division officers were also re-assigned.
</p>
<p>The plan suggested by General Scott, and adopted by McClellan, and
</p>
<p>submitted by him to President Lincoln in his memorandum of August
</p>
<p>4th, 1861, just before his appointment as General in Chief, was the crush
</p>
<p>ing of the seceding states by a system known as the anaconda strategy.
</p>
<p>This plan had proved a grievous failure, besides the Young Napoleon
</p>
<p>was without the requisite ability to discover the key-point of the enemy's
</p>
<p>position. Like the Athenian General Nicias, before Syracuse, he was
</p>
<p>feeble and vacillating, and looked for civilians to sympathize with his
</p>
<p>imbecility. He had long endeavored to cover his own inefficiency by
</p>
<p>creating needless difficulties in his superior's way ; and after a weak and
</p>
<p>sickly existence of four hundred and seventy days, his frail and feeble
</p>
<p>military life, so expensive to the nation, was brought to a close. Dis
</p>
<p>affected towards his superiors, and dissatisfied with himself, he

<p>joined the Copperhead faction, and entered the political arena and bo-

<p>came the leader of all the sympathizers with the rebel cause in the
</p>
<p>free states, and engaged in organizing them politicaUy to make a
</p>
<p>cowardly charge against the Administration, hoping to prove successful,
</p>
<p>and thereby retrieve his reputation lost in the field. The failure of his
</p>
<p>successors, Pope, Burnside, and Hooker, to become more successful,

</p>
<p>the soldiers' minds whether it had been dictated by wisdom ; from a
</p>
<p>murmur they were passing into discontent. In fact, if it had not been for
</p>
<p>General Meade's great victory at Gettysburg, which convinced the Po
</p>
<p>tomac army that others could lead them to victory, serious consequences
</p>
<p>might have resulted from the change, although three years' of bitter
</p>
<p>warfare had accomplished Uttle for the Union cause in Virgina ;
</p>
<p>yet Grant, with his troops had driven the rebel forces back from
</p>
<p>the Ohio, the Tennessee, and opened up the great Mississippi. The
</p>
<p>rebels themselves were compeUed to acknowledge the western troops,
</p>
<p>equal to their own, and now Pickett's, Wilson's, and Pettigrew's rebel
</p>
<p>divisions, who made the charge on Meade's centre (McPherson's heights) ,
</p>
<p>on Friday, July 3d, 1863, were satisfied that no braver men ever lived
</p>
<p>than those comprising the gallant but badly managed army of the Poto
</p>
<p>mac. Pickett's division lost every brigadier officer, and out of twenty-
</p>
<p>four regimental officers, ouly two remained unhurt ; the other two divis
</p>
<p>ions suffered nearly as much. This great victory convinced the army of
</p>
<p>the Potomac that Lee could be conquered. Inspired by hew hope, Mc
</p>
<p>Clellan and defeat passed from their minds together, and watching they
</p>
<p>patiently waited for the coming man. While this victory gave confidence
</p>
<p>to the army and friends of the government, the news of Lee's defeat and
</p>
<p>the fall of Aricksburg reached the rebel capital on the same day ; and like
</p>
<p>the previous faU of Fort Donallson and New Orleans, cast a dark shadow
</p>
<p>over the rebel cause, while McClellan was passing into oblivion. The
</p>
<p>sword that Grant wielded over Vicksburg had gained him the position
</p>
<p>of the first soldier of the Union. He had not only triumphed over great
</p>
<p>natural difficulties and elaborate defences, but his strategic march on the
</p>
<p>enemy's rear, and his after patient watching, placed in the military horizon
</p>
<p>another brilliant star ; and then the surprise and ford of the river near
</p>
<p>Bragg's centre by Smith, and the manoeuvring by which the confederate
</p>
<p>lines were forced by Grant, a month later, at the battle of Chattanooga, are,
</p>
<p>as tactical achievements, far fitter to be classed with the best feats of
</p>
<p>Napoleon aud Wellington, than any advantage won by any European Gen
</p>
<p>eral since the days of those giants in war.

</p>
<p>eye the progress of the battle, and like Miltiades, on the plain of
</p>
<p>Marathon, or the great Macedonian at Arbela, is prepared to strike
</p>
<p>the decisive blow at the right time. Although Grant heretofore had
</p>
<p>been everywhere successful in the Southwest, yet he had never meas

<p>ured arms with Lee, who was acknowledged the best general in the con
</p>
<p>federate service, and his troops were the flower of the rebel army. Mc
</p>
<p>Clellan, Pope, Burnside, and Hooker, had never been able to conquer him,
</p>
<p>278 LIEUTENANT GENERAL GRANT.
</p>
<p>and the country was held in breathless suspense dreading that their hope*
</p>
<p>and expectation in Grant's success might never be realized. One of the
</p>
<p>grandest campaigns on record, surpassing any thing reeorded in Persian,
</p>
<p>Macedonian, or Roman history, and all under the command of the Lieu-
</p>
<p>nant-General was now about to commence ; Sherman to pursue Johnston
</p>
<p>m Georgia, Gen. Banks on Red River, and General Steele in Arkansas,
</p>
<p>with Butler on the right bank of the James, threatening the rebel Capital.
</p>
<p>The combinations were of a magnitude hitherto unknown in war.
</p>
<p>They extended over a vast territory from the Chesapeake Bay, on the At
</p>
<p>lantic, to the Gulf of Mexico, thence northward through the great Indian
</p>
<p>Territory to the upper country of Missouri, and striking eastward includ
</p>
<p>ed Tennessee and all the states in Rebellion. Having forwared his ord
</p>
<p>ers to his Lientenants in the different portions of the vast field over
</p>
<p>which he was master, the Lieutenant-General, accompanied by several
</p>
<p>of his staff officers, made a tour of survey of all the Union forces in
</p>
<p>Virginia. By orders of Gen. Grant, active measures were taken to get into the
</p>
<p>field all recruits, new organizations and troops that could be spared.
</p>
<p>Reinforcements were constantly pouring into the army of the Potomac.
</p>
<p>The notes of military preparation all over the country indicated the near
</p>
<p>approach of a vigorous campaign. Now the Lieutenat-General is
</p>
<p>on a tour of Snspectien, then he is closeted with the authoritiesat Wash
</p>
<p>ington, until the close of April, 1864, when all the preliminaries seemed
</p>
<p>to have been settled. Civilians and sutlers are ordered out of the lines,
</p>
<p>and no more passes are granted to applicants for admission. Meantime
</p>
<p>Lee was not idle. He busied himself in the erection of additional fortifi
</p>
<p>cations along the south bank of the Rapidan, in anticipation of the com
</p>
<p>ing contest. But Grant was not disposed to wait on the development of
</p>
<p>Lee's plans.
</p>
<p>He had weU-digested plans of his own, which he prepared to put in
</p>
<p>execution, and until the early part of May, 1864, he labored incessantly,
</p>
<p>concentrating his valiant troops preliminary to the grand onward move
</p>
<p>ment. THE GRAND ADVANCE.
</p>
<p>On the 3d of May, 1864, General Grant advanced from Culpepper Court

<p>House to the Rapidan, part of his army crossing at Ely'B Ford, and part
</p>
<p>at Germania Ford. Lee was now in a position selected by himself, and

<p>battle ground occupied by him was a broken table land, irregular
</p>
<p>in its conformation, and densely covered with dwarf timber and under

<p>growth. The rebels had taken their position near its edge, leaving au

<p>open country at the back of Grant's army. It was well known to Lea

<p>account of the knolly character of the ground, in conjunction with this

<p>timber, to prevent him from using it.
</p>
<p>After some delay with the corps, the standard of the army of the Poto

<p>mac, was struck in the earth near the old Wilderness Tavern, and on
</p>
<p>Thursday the generals began to gather around it. The brave and calcu

<p>lating Meade, the hero of Gettysburg, was there with his gray beard,
</p>
<p>Hancock, Warren, Sedgwick, and many other generals, examining maps
</p>
<p>and consulting about the coming fight. At last Warren gallopped off at the

<p>head of his column, a little to the left of the Wilderness Tavern, and in a
</p>
<p>short time his army was in Une of battle, passing in the direction of Orange
</p>
<p>Court House, showing Griffin's division in line of battle far to the front. The
</p>
<p>contest soon grew from picket-firing to skirmishing, and from sldrmishing
</p>
<p>to battle, and by twelve o'clock, meridian, the action had fairly commenced.
</p>
<p>From Warren's lines the battle spread to Sedgwick's early in the afternoon ;
</p>
<p>thisheoric officer fought the ground over, pressing the rebels back, inch by
</p>
<p>inch, until they long before night became sick of the sport, and the action
</p>
<p>dwindled into a skirmish. On the left, Hancock gave Longstreet a lesson
</p>
<p>in the art of war : here the conflict was terrific. As the evening came on
</p>
<p>the contest along the entire lines ceased, only au occasional shot being fired
</p>
<p>to show that the enemy was yet in his well chosen position. Grant was on
</p>
<p>the field during the day, and expressed himself well satisfied with the pro
</p>
<p>gress that had been made. In the evening he perfected his plans for renew
</p>
<p>ing the battle the next morning.
</p>
<p>Early Friday morning the contest was renewed along the entire line, but
</p>
<p>fiercest before Hancock's division. Lee had determined to force his lines,
</p>
<p>and sent Longstreet, backed with heavy reinforcements, to accomplish the
</p>
<p>object. Twice Hancock was driven back to his breastworks, and once the
</p>
<p>rebels had so far succeeded as to plant their colors on his field works, but
</p>
<p>the stay was short. The conflict was now terrific. Such fighting as
</p>
<p>Hancock did that day, for bravery, could never have been surpassed. Back
</p>
<p>and fortli  first charged and then charging  untU hundreds of the dead
</p>
<p>bodies of Union and rebel soldiers lay side by side in their last sleep.
</p>
<p>At last, Burnside with the ninth corps, came to his relief, when he was
</p>
<p>allowed a breathing spell. Later in the day, Sedgwick's hour of trial came.
</p>
<p>In the forenoon they made a desperate effort to turn Grant's left, and

<p>now, in the afternoon, they revived the effort on the extreme right.
</p>
<p>A P. Hill was commanding the enemy, and two of the Union brigades, on
</p>
<p>the extreme right, commanded by Seymour and Staler, were swallowed up
</p>
<p>by the impetuous charge of the yelling rebels. They almost caused a route
</p>
<p>in this part of the army, but Sedgwick, bold and ever brave, took ad
</p>
<p>vantage of the reflux, which always follows the first impetus of a charge, and
</p>
<p>formed the corps and drove the enemy beyond his breastworks and plucked
</p>
<p>safety, if not victory, out of danger.
</p>
<p>280 LIEUTENANT GENERAL GRANT.
</p>
<p>The teamsters and straggling soldiers who had been watching this
</p>
<p>fearful conflict from a safe distance, just as night set in commenced a
</p>
<p>stampede. This wild scene lasted about one hour and a half, when it
</p>
<p>was checked by the iron hand of military law. The rebels still impetuous
</p>
<p>made a night attack on Warren's line ; this was a desperate resort of Lee.
</p>
<p>How differently he acted from Alexander the Great, when his veteran
</p>
<p>general, Parmenio, came and proposed a night attack on the Persians.
</p>
<p>" I scorn to filch a victory ; Alexander must conquer openly and fairly,"
</p>
<p>was the reply of the great Macedonian.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the 5th corps was thrown into confusion and driven
</p>
<p>back by the night assault, the rebel skirmishers came close up to Meade
</p>
<p>and Grant's headquarters. While this was going on every officer and
</p>
<p>private could see only defeat. But the great chieftain was commencing
</p>
<p>a flank movement. There was no Boeotian brigade as at Syracuse, to
</p>
<p>defeat and repel the night attack made by Demosthenes ; although Grant
</p>
<p>did not succeed like Gylippus, the Spartan general, in defeating and
</p>
<p>capturing the enemy, yet his flanking movement almost turned a defeat
</p>
<p>into a victory. His right had been turned and Germania Ford was in
</p>
<p>the hands of the enemy, and his loss in the battle could not have
</p>
<p>been less than 15,000 ; yet by daylight nearly all the trains had passed
</p>
<p>to the left of the right center, but no one could even guess the purport
</p>
<p>of the movement.
</p>
<p>On Saturday Grant had possession of the road to within twp and a half
</p>
<p>miles of Spottsylvania Court House, and a little after midnight the same
</p>
<p>day, his headquarters were at Todd's Tavern. Some skirmishing had
</p>
<p>gone on during this movement and another desperate confhci came
</p>
<p>off on Sabbath evening, General Wright's division taking the lead.
</p>
<p>Mill's brigade and the Jersey troops were once more in the thickest of
</p>
<p>the fight. Tet Spottsylvania Court House still remained that night in
</p>
<p>the hands of the rebels. Oh Monday General Sedgwick was inspecting
</p>
<p>the pickets in front, attended by two of his staff, when a ball from a
</p>
<p>rebel sharp-shooter struck him below the eye passing upwardly through
</p>
<p>the brain, killing him instantly.
</p>
<p>On the same day a train of ambulances containing some thirteen thou
</p>
<p>sand wounded, were attacked and turned back at Ely's Ford. They fi

<p>nally proceeded to Fredericksburg where every house was converted into
</p>
<p>a hospital. Hancock changed his position during Monday night, so as
</p>
<p>to be in line of battle one mile and a half in advance, driving the enemy
</p>
<p>before him. At ten o'clock Cutter's division of the Fifth corps advanced
</p>
<p>and formed in line of battle to the right and rear of Hancock's left. This
</p>
<p>division was within musket range of a piece of woods filled with rebels
</p>
<p>and maintained their position nearly the entire day, subject to terrible
</p>
<p>artillery and musketry fire of the enemy, which they returned with great
</p>
<p>BATTLE OF THE WILDERNESS. 281
</p>
<p>effect. A portion of Griffin's division were sent to drive the rebels out
</p>
<p>of the woods held by them on the right of the Fifth corps. They en
</p>
<p>tered the woods by brigades which were relieved alternately, and for
</p>
<p>hours the deadly and determined fight continued. Batteries D and H of
</p>
<p>the First New York Artillery did fine execution from their position on
</p>
<p>the left of these woods. Cooper's First Pennsylvania Battery was held
</p>
<p>in reserve on the brow of a hill ready to cover any reverse our men
</p>
<p>who were fighting so desperately in the woPds in frpnt might sustain.
</p>
<p>At twelve o'clock General Rice, who was gallantly leading the Fourth di
</p>
<p>vision of the Fifth corps into action, was struck in the knee with a rebel
</p>
<p>musket ball was carried to the rear and died that afternoon. His divi
</p>
<p>sion was constantly engaged during the day and for three hours without
</p>
<p>intermission, was subject to a murderous and galling fire from different
</p>
<p>directions of the enemy. From ten o'clock in the morning until
</p>
<p>night set in, the battle raged with fury. Division after division went
</p>
<p>into the woods and pressed steadily forward. No column returned ex
</p>
<p>cept to take a rest at the edge of the woods while being relieved by
</p>
<p>others. The roar of artillery, the sharp rolling of musketry, and burst
</p>
<p>ing of shells, was absolutely fearful. Two divisions of Hancock's corps
</p>
<p>changed positions early in the afternoon, and after a little rest went into
</p>
<p>the woods with great spirit engaging the enemy. Wright's corps during
</p>
<p>the morning was engaged in sheUing the woods to the right which were
</p>
<p>filled with rebels. Early in the afternoon the rebels retired to a safer
</p>
<p>position. About dark the general headquarters was removed a mile
</p>
<p>nearer the front, affording General Grant and Meade a fine view of the
</p>
<p>operations of the enemy. About, this time a line of rebel intrenchments
</p>
<p>was assaulted and carried, our men actually crawling over them on their
</p>
<p>hands and knees and precipitating themselves on the other side. Upton's
</p>
<p>brigade of the Sixth corps was attacked by a large body of confederates,
</p>
<p>some of whom got in their rear, but before this engagement was over
</p>
<p>two thousand of the rebels and several pieces of artiUery were cap
</p>
<p>tured. During this days engagement Lee moved a large body of troops
</p>
<p>in front of Grant's center, for the purpose of breaking his lines and as a
</p>
<p>ruse sent two brigades of infantry to make a demonstration on the right.
</p>
<p>Grant was the last to be deceived and commenced to make his center

<p>doubly strong. When Lee began to assault the center he soon dis
</p>
<p>covered that his feint on Grant's right did not have the desired effect.
</p>
<p>His new adversary had concentrated a superior force in the right place
</p>
<p>and at the right time. The only result of this movement of Lee, was to
</p>
<p>mass troops on both sides and when he made the assault, to his great
</p>
<p>surprise, he found Grant ready.
</p>
<p>The fighting of this day was of an extraordinary character ; many thou
</p>
<p>sands of men were kiUed and a large number of officers. The old veter-
</p>
<p>282 LIEUTENANT GENERAL GRANT.
</p>
<p>ans of the Potomac army said it surpassed all engagements they had yet
</p>
<p>seen on the Peninsula. On Wednesday morning, May 11th, the battle
</p>
<p>was renewed at Spottsylvania, Grant's lines being somewhat advanced.
</p>
<p>At eleven o'clock A. M. Lee sent a flag asking a forty-eight hour truce
</p>
<p>that he might have time to bury his dead. Grant's reply was : " I have
</p>
<p>no time to bury my own dead but propose an immediate advance."
</p>
<p>With this reply he pushed forward, his advanced lines sheUing the
</p>
<p>woods, but no response was met from where the enemy's center had
</p>
<p>been a few hours before. The rebel prisoners captured on Tuesday and
</p>
<p>Wednesday, numbered four thousand, and the dead and wounded covered
</p>
<p>almost every foot of the ground, when the Union troops surged forward
</p>
<p>and the rebels gave way. The slaughter on both sides was appalling
</p>
<p>but the rebels suffered the most. General Grant sent the foUowing tele
</p>
<p>graph to Secretary Stanton :
</p>
<p>Headquarters in the Field, May 11, 1864, 8 A. M.
</p>
<p>" We have now ended the sixth day of very heavy fighting. The re
</p>
<p>sult, to this time, is much in our favor.
</p>
<p>' ' Our losses have been heavy as well as those of the enemy. I think
</p>
<p>the loss of the enemy must be greater.
</p>
<p>" We have taken over five thousand prisoners by battle, while he has
</p>
<p>taken from us but few, except stragglers.
</p>
<p>" I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer."
</p>
<p>U. S. Grant.
</p>
<p>" Lieut. -General, Commanding the Armies qfthe United States."
</p>
<p>General Grant must have felt certain that victory was within his grasp
</p>
<p>when he sent the above dispatch. He had now reached the key of the
</p>
<p>rebel position, for the same evening he ordered General Hancock to
</p>
<p>move during the night close up to the intrenchments, held by the rebel
</p>
<p>general Ewell's corps. Slowly and surely Hancock's men crept forward,
</p>
<p>and at dawn they were close upon the sleeping and unsuspecting enemy.
</p>
<p>At the proper moment the order to charge was given, and with a loud
</p>
<p>yell Hancock's men leaped over the rebel intrenchments and with the
</p>
<p>butts, of their muskets (the quarters were too close to fire) commenced to
</p>
<p>slay the enemy right and left. They were surrounded, cornered,and dumb

<p>their arms and became prisoners of war. Even the artillery had not
</p>
<p>time to limber up, get away, or fire one single voUey. The general E.
</p>
<p>Johnston, whose headquarters was somewhat to the rear, had no time to
</p>
<p>escape. The result of this great movement was the capture of the
</p>
<p>commanding general with nearly his entire division as prisoners of war,
</p>
<p>and nearly twenty pieces of artillery. Hancock's entire corps had ad-

<p>COLD HARBOR AND GAINE'S MILLS. 283
</p>
<p>vanced during the morning, the rebels contesting every point with great
</p>
<p>determination, yet the gaUant corps continued to advance, and before
</p>
<p>noon the entire Une was engaged in a fierce and bloody strife. After
</p>
<p>seven days severe fighting, amid drenching rain, volleys of musketry,
</p>
<p>and roar of artillery, wearied but not disheartened, the gallant heroes
</p>
<p>pressed on driving the remaining part of the enemy back nearly four
</p>
<p>miles. Lee was thus forced to abandon his strong position on the Rap
</p>
<p>idan and fall back. He endeavored to stop the advance of the Union
</p>
<p>army, but he had now been forced to abandon his last entrenched posi
</p>
<p>tion with a loss of eighteen guns, twenty colors, and eight thousand
</p>
<p>prisoners, including two general officers. Thus, the enemy sullenly and
</p>
<p>reluctantly was driven from the Rapidan. During the eight days and
</p>
<p>nights that the engagement lasted, many thousands went to their long
</p>
<p>home. The victory, though dearly bought, was gained, and Lee
</p>
<p>through this terrible conflict was made to realize the coming fate of the
</p>
<p>Southern Confederacy. During this eventful time General Sherman was
</p>
<p>making his famous flank movement which compeUed Johnston to evacu
</p>
<p>ate Dalton, Georgia, and General Butler was defeating the rebels on the
</p>
<p>south side of the James. Sheridan with his cavalry was destroying the
</p>
<p>raUroad bridge over the Chickahominy river, fighting a battle at YeUow
</p>
<p>Tavern with the rebel general Stewart, and charging down the Brock
</p>
<p>Road actually capturing the first line of the enemy's works on that side
</p>
<p>of Richmond.
</p>
<p>On the 13th of May, Burnside with the ninth corps lay across the pike
</p>
<p>leading from Spottsylvania Court House to Fredericksburg, about two
</p>
<p>miles from the former place ; here he had a severe engagement with A.
</p>
<p>P. HiU. Although Burnside moved early to the attack, he found the
</p>
<p>rebels over a mile in front of their breastworks waiting his coming ; the
</p>
<p>fight commenced and the rebels were soon pushed back into their first
</p>
<p>Une of fortifications, and then forced to take refuge in their main line of
</p>
<p>entrenchments. Burnside renewed the attack in the afternoon, but a
</p>
<p>flanking brigade of rebels captured a portion of the Fifty-First Pennsylva
</p>
<p>nia, One Hundred and Ninth New York, and the Seventeenth Michigan
</p>
<p>regiments. Burnside gained a better position than he had at the com

<p>were very bad, and itwas difficult to move, and little was done until Lee
</p>
<p>weary and disheartened showed signs of attempting a retreat. On the
</p>
<p>18th Grant renewed the attack; the assault was commenced ' early,
</p>
<p>but the rebels were not again to be found napping ; by this move Grant
</p>
<p>soon discovered the enemy strongly posted behind breastworks. On
</p>
<p>the 19th EweU's corps made an attempt to turn Grant's right, but was
</p>
<p>severe'y punished by Birney and Tyler's divisions. Grant had now re

<p>ceived about 25,000 splendid fresh troops forwarded to him to make up
</p>
<p>284 LIEUTENANT GENERAL GRANT.
</p>
<p>his losses during the terrific battles on the Rapidan. Onthe 20th of May
</p>
<p>he by the flanking process compelled Lee to abandon his strong works at
</p>
<p>Spottsylvania Court House, the rebels retreating towards Richmond ;
</p>
<p>Grant's army in pursuit. FaUing behind the North Anna river, Lee took
</p>
<p>up another strong position by marching the fifth and sixth corps by way
</p>
<p>of Harris's Store to Jerrico Ford ; the sixth corps crossing, Lee was again
</p>
<p>flanked, and compelled to abandon his strong position on the North
</p>
<p>Anna, and fell back to the South Anna river. Here Lee's position was
</p>
<p>discovered to be one of great strength, and Grant deeming it only a waste
</p>
<p>of life to make an assault, recrossed the North Anna river, moving
</p>
<p>his army in the direction of Hanover Junction. Thus out generaling and
</p>
<p>flanking Lee's position on the South Anna, he fprced him again to abandon
</p>
<p>his elaborately constructed fortifications. By these master strategic
</p>
<p>movements, it became evident to all the corps and division commanders
</p>
<p>in Grant's army that he had outmanbeuvered Lee, and drove him from all
</p>
<p>his positions, using him merely as his mouthpiece, as he had previously
</p>
<p>used Bragg at Chattanooga. It could be seen by all that it was Grant and
</p>
<p>not Lee that was commanding the rebel army. General Sheridan with
</p>
<p>his cavalry had taken possession of the Hanover Ferry and all points
</p>
<p>designated for bringing the army over the Pamunkey river, and by the
</p>
<p>29th Grant's entire force was across and encamped in a fertile country
</p>
<p>only fifteen miles from Richmond. By this great move he turned aU
</p>
<p>Lee's works on the Little river and the South Anna, avoiding the
</p>
<p>hazard of crossing these strongly defended streams ; by this strategy he
</p>
<p>became master of the situation with regard to his new base of supplies,
</p>
<p>and he was now left to choose his own rout to the rebel capital, and all
</p>
<p>this had been accomplished in twenty-four days from the day he struck
</p>
<p>tents at Culpepper Court House, withoutleaving, as previous commanders
</p>
<p>did, one fourth of his army behind for the defence of the capital,  he was
</p>
<p>now master of the peninsula without having uncovered Washington for a
</p>
<p>single hour.
</p>
<p>It was the same strategy that made the march from Bruinsburg to
</p>
<p>Vicksburg one unbroken series of victories. Iu the march Grant cut
</p>
<p>himself loose from his base, but he always fixed a point to open a new
</p>
<p>one. Raymond was his first, Warrenton just below Vicksburg his second,

</p>
<p>and the Yazoo river just above the city was his final and last, until Vicks
</p>
<p>burg fell ; this last, tho Yazoo was hit upon by his far seeing vision at
</p>
<p>the commencement. Raymond and Warrenton were only calculated as
</p>
<p>auxiliaries to secure it. Just so he moved in his present campaign
</p>
<p>against Richmond. In his new base he could open communication with
</p>
<p>General Butler, and with the two armies, when occasion required ; and
</p>
<p>he could now supp'.y his troops from the Pamunkey or the James at his
</p>
<p>option.
</p>
<p>CROSSING THE JAMES. 285
</p>
<p>Such mighty achievements can only be done by a master in the art of
</p>
<p>war, and as he made the month of May 1863, ever memorable by his stiategy
</p>
<p>in his campaign of the Soulhwest ; so his illustrious achievements in May
</p>
<p>1864 on the Peninslua will be cherished and remembered as long as re
</p>
<p>turning spring continues to deck the banks of the Rapidan, the Anna,
</p>
<p>the Pamunkey, and James with its fragrant flowers. The month of June
</p>
<p>opened with another fight with the rebels at Cold Harbor, on Friday
</p>
<p>about seven P.M. June 3d, the rebels made an attack on Smith's bri
</p>
<p>gade of Gibson's division. Fighting around Cold Harbor continued for
</p>
<p>about three days. At last Grant commenced gradually drawing the
</p>
<p>Unes around them, they fought desperately as usual; our entire loss
</p>
<p>killed wounded and missing during the three days engagements was
</p>
<p>7,500 men.  Grant was extending his lines to the Chickahominy, and
</p>
<p>the White House was now the base of supplies for his army. On the
</p>
<p>12th of June he commenced his great flank movement from Lee's front
</p>
<p>at Cold Harbor and Game's Mills. Such a movement is the most dangerous
</p>
<p>in the art of war. McClellan in changing his base in 1862, was harrassed
</p>
<p>at every step, his army had occupied both sides of the Chicahominy,
</p>
<p>by doing this he made a weak and dangerous extension of his lines, the
</p>
<p>part on the north side of that river was driven on the 26th of June
</p>
<p>across to the south side of the stream. McClellan now commenced his
</p>
<p>retreat to Harrison's Landing, his army fighting by day and letreating
</p>
<p>by night, so when the army on the seventh day reached Harrison's Land
</p>
<p>ing, fifteen thousand men who had been with him on the Chickahominy,
</p>
<p>were no longer in the ranks ; the greater part were lying mangled and
</p>
<p>bleeding onthe line of retreat, or sleeping their last sleep. But how dif-
</p>
<p>ferentthe ability displayed by Grant, who withdrew his entire army to the
</p>
<p>banks of the James, coming out at Wilcox's Warf, and crossing at Paw-
</p>
<p>hatan Point ; leaving Cold Harbor Sunday night, the troops were in posi
</p>
<p>tion for crossing the James river in thirty hours, and in six hours more
</p>
<p>the entire army with scarcely the loss of a man was landed on the south
</p>
<p>side of the James river. On Wednesday General Smith commenced an
</p>
<p>attack on Petersburg ; several efforts were made to carry the place by as-
</p>
<p>sault,but Grant was convincedthat the Cockade City could only be captured
</p>
<p>by a protracted siege. General Wilson with six thousand picked troops

<p>was struck at Reams Station, and the later at Ford's Station, and some

<p>sixty miles of track, together with bridges, cars, and locomotives were

<p>destroyed. General Wright with the 6th corps cooperated with Wilson
</p>
<p>by meving on the Weldon road below Petersburg, and destroying about
</p>
<p>five miles of track. Lee becoming worried and disheartened, thought to
</p>
<p>divert Grant from his well settled purpese, sent Brcckenridge on a raid

<p>against Washington ; but Grant could not he induced to withdraw his

<p>army from the James. Breckenridge went and made the feint, and was
</p>
<p>defeated, leaving 500 of his men kUled and wounded under the guns of
</p>
<p>Fort Stephen.
</p>
<p>The explosion of Burnside's mine under one of the largest rebel forts
</p>
<p>at Petersburg, blew up a South Carolina regiment, and wrecked the
</p>
<p>interior of the work. General Burnside in the assaulting of the works
</p>
<p>after the explosion, lost over two thousand men, killed, wounded, and
</p>
<p>missing. The rebel loss was about 1,200; this was aU the impor

<p>summer of 1864. But the mighty chieftain was not idle, he had so dis

<p>tributed his army that his Ueutenants were hammering away at the sea
</p>
<p>ports of the rebellion at every point of the compass, having forced Lee
</p>
<p>from the Rapidan, and compeUed him to coop himself up behind his
</p>
<p>Richmond defences. Sherman was also showing himself to be master of
</p>
<p>the rebel armies of the Southwest by the capture of Atlanta, September 2d.
</p>
<p>GEN. SHERIDAN'S GREAT VICTORY.
</p>
<p>BATTLE of oedab CREEK, VA., OCTOBER 19, 1864.
</p>
<p>This able commander was sent to the Shenandoah Valley, to take com
</p>
<p>mand of the forces, in the latter part of September, and prevent the advance
</p>
<p>of the rebels into Pennsylvania and Maryland.
</p>
<p>The Richmond authorities, fearing that Grant had sent him for the pur
</p>
<p>pose of advancing on Richmond from that direction, sent a command to the
</p>
<p>rebel Gen. Early to drive Sheridan and his army out of the Valley.
</p>
<p>The Union general had been at Washington, in consultation with the Sec
</p>
<p>retary of War ; and, with other commanders, stopped on his way back to
</p>
<p>his camp at Winchester. Early took advantage of the fog and absence of
</p>
<p>Sheridan, to make a desperate attack on the Union army. On the 19th of Oc
</p>
<p>tober, just before daylight the pickets were driven in, and the rebels, in
</p>
<p>hot pursuit, entered the Union camp at the same time. Such a large body
</p>
<p>of rebel infantry soon threw the left wing of Sheridan's army into confusion.
</p>
<p>The Fourteenth Pennsylvania, and a portion of the regular battery, fell into
</p>
<p>the hands of the rebels. The confusion almost reached a panic. Cook's
</p>
<p>corps was scarcely allowed time to form, but finally succeeded, and was
</p>
<p>soon joined by part of Thornburn's division. During all this time the rebels
</p>
<p>were pouring an incessant fire from both infantry and artillery. All this

</p>
<p>was done before daylight, and following up their success, they made a
</p>
<p>charge on the 19th corps, Emery's command, taking one or two guns of
</p>
<p>the First Maine battery and some of Chase's. The rebels had got the
</p>
<p>range and were using their artillery with great effect.
</p>
<p>The gray dawn of an October morning was the first to reveal the desper
</p>
<p>ate situation of the left wing of the Union army. When the rebels discov-
</p>
<p>BATTLE OF CEDAR CREEK. 287
</p>
<p>ered their advantage, they began to bring their artiUery across Cedar Creek,
</p>
<p>and press hard up. The entire Union army was concentrating and slowly
</p>
<p>falling back. Gen. Sheridan, as we before stated, was at Winchester
</p>
<p>hearing the booming of cannon, while it was yet dark, in the direction of
</p>
<p>his army. He started at half-past seven o'clock, A. M. , and in two hours
</p>
<p>arrived at the scene of action. On his way he met a great number of teams ,
</p>
<p>stragglers, and wounded men, going to the rear. Such a sight would have
</p>
<p>discouraged most men, but nothing daunted he pushed on only to witness
</p>
<p>a worse condition of affairs than he had expected. The army was in
</p>
<p>confusion. It had no confidence in itself. But his presence inspired all
</p>
<p>with new hope. The change was like magic. He immediately reorgan
</p>
<p>ized his forces that he had just met on retreat, putting the cavalry on
</p>
<p>the right, the Nineteenth Corps next to it, the Eighth Corps in the cen
</p>
<p>tre, and the Sixth Corps with PoweU's division on the left. Thus organ
</p>
<p>ized, a furious attack was made on the rebel army about one o'clock,
</p>
<p>P. M. For two hours the fight was desperate, but at three o'clock the
</p>
<p>rebels gave way. Sheridan was everywhere to be seen urging his men
</p>
<p>to press on after the retreating foe, which had become a rout. The
</p>
<p>rebels being chased through the streets of Middletown, and on to Mount
</p>
<p>Jackson, over 2,000 broke and ran down the mountain, throwing away
</p>
<p>arms, knapsacks and blankets, to aid in securing safety. The rebel loss
</p>
<p>was about 3,000 killed, 7,000 prisoners, many of them wounded, 55 can
</p>
<p>non, a great number of small arms, ten battle flags, and over 300 wagons
</p>
<p>and ambulances. The Union officers suffered severely, in one of General
</p>
<p>Grover's brigades, every field officer being killed or disabled; in another
</p>
<p>only three were left. The Union loss in killed, wounded, and missing,
</p>
<p>was 4086. For this great victory, President Lincoln sent Gen. Sheridan
</p>
<p>the following letter : "Executive Mansion, Washington, Oct. 22, 1864.
</p>
<p>" Major-General Sheridan  With great pleasure I tender to you and
</p>
<p>your brave army the thanks of the nation, and my own personal admira
</p>
<p>tion and gratitude for the month's operations in the Shenandoah VaUey,
</p>
<p>and especially for the splendid work of October 19.
</p>
<p>Your obedient servant, "Abraham Lincoln."

<p>could be penetrated almost as easy, agreed and arranged with General
</p>
<p>Sherman to make his great expedition through the heart of the confed
</p>
<p>eracy, which has crowned that great soldier's name with immortality.
</p>
<p>Grant had now got Lee in a position that he could spare no troops

</p>
<p>from Virginia. It was even doubtful, whether he could long, protect the
</p>
<p>rebel capital,  Sherman at Savannah, Hood's army captured, and Gen.
</p>
<p>Price driven out of Missouri, Early used up by Sheridan in the Shenan
</p>
<p>doah, Breckinridge checkmated in EastTennessee, Canby operating effec
</p>
<p>tually iu Louisiana, and preparing to capture Mobile, and Grant at Rich
</p>
<p>mond holding Lee in a vice from which there was no escape,  these were
</p>
<p>the darkest days the rebellion had yet seen. It was v ell understood the
</p>
<p>flower of its youth and the days of its manhood were passed. Its greatest
</p>
<p>efforts, all its heroic achievements were forever gone, unanimated and
</p>
<p>dying, its huge form lay stretched from the Potomac to the Rio Grande,
</p>
<p>unable to give one more cheer, or do another defiant deed.
</p>
<p>The year 1865 opened with cheering prospects for the Union cause.
</p>
<p>Sherman, with his invincible army, had left Georgia on his northward
</p>
<p>march. The principal nests of treason, Columbia and Charleston, were
</p>
<p>captured, and all the rebel strongholds embraced in the mighty combi
</p>
<p>nations on the seaboard and interior of Georgia, South Carolina, including
</p>
<p>Fort Fisher and Wilmington, in North Carolina, (the latter had long been
</p>
<p>the rebel inlet to British pirates, British arms, British amunition, Brit
</p>
<p>ish goods, and British treachery,) all these had been captured and were
</p>
<p>now being held by the grand divisions of the Union army. The Great
</p>
<p>Campaign commenced in March. Canby aided by the fleet, was batter
</p>
<p>ing away at Mobile ; Gen. Wilson, with ten thousand picked cavahy,
</p>
<p>started from Eastport on an expedition through Alabama ; Sherman and
</p>
<p>Scofield, with their victorious hosts, approaching the Virginia Slate line.
</p>
<p>Johnston, whom the rebel press had boasted, was sent to annihilate the
</p>
<p>insolent foe, failed to impede or check their victorious march there.
</p>
<p>The rebel chief at Richmond saw all this, but he was apaUed, and
</p>
<p>helpless and could only watch and wait. The rebel affairs every day be
</p>
<p>came more critical. The rebel commander yet had an army of 50,000 tried
</p>
<p>men filling, and being protected by, the strong and numerous fortifications
</p>
<p>surrounding the doomed capital. Strategy was now beyond Lee's reach,
</p>
<p>and his last hope was that Grant would attempt an assault upon these
</p>
<p>works. But as he had never before done what Lee desired or expected,
</p>
<p>he had little ground to expect it now.
</p>
<p>Grant had time to watch, but Lee could not afford to wait ; his only

</p>
<p>hope was in prompt and immediate action. Thus at half-past four, A. M.,
</p>
<p>March 25th, 1865, Lee sent Gordon, at the head of three rebel divisions,
</p>
<p>to attack Fort Steadman, on the right of Grant's line. He soon over
</p>
<p>powered the garrison and seized the fort, but the success was but tem
</p>
<p>porary, for at the dawn of day Gen. Hartranft charged and re-captured it,
</p>
<p>killing and wounding over 3,000 rebels, and taking 2,700 prisoners. The
</p>
<p>reason of the great slaughter and our trifling loss, was our guns at the
</p>
<p>different forts were trained on the ground over which the rebels had to
</p>
<p>PREPARING FOR THE CONFLICT. 289
</p>
<p>pass to re-gain their own line ; when they all opened fire, the slaughter
</p>
<p>was terrific. The capture of Gordon's men gave Grant a full key to the
</p>
<p>mystery, and he ordered an immediate advance upon the extreme left of
</p>
<p>Hatcher's run, which ppmt Lee had weakened by the withdrawal of Gor
</p>
<p>don's forces. Several strong positions were taken by the advance, and
</p>
<p>Grant's lines were extended to near the South Side railroad. The Union
</p>
<p>loss was 690 ; the rebel loss, killed, wounded and captured were about
</p>
<p>1600. The Second Corps also pushed forward and captured Fort Fisher
</p>
<p>and the entrenched picket line on the 29th. The Second Corps left their
</p>
<p>entrenchments near Hatcher's Run, and advanced out along the Vaughn
</p>
<p>Road. The Fifth Corps, which had been stationed in the rear of the Sec
</p>
<p>ond, at three and a half o'clock, A. M., started, going over by-roads
</p>
<p>across the country, so as to reach the Vaughn Road at a point beyond
</p>
<p>where the Second Corps was to march. Up to this time, Gen. Ayer's
</p>
<p>division taking the lead, one brigade under Gen. Gwin was posted at
</p>
<p>Scott's House to cover the Vaughn Road, while the remainder of the di
</p>
<p>vision was held in reserve. Griffin's division was then placed in advance.
</p>
<p>The column now left the Vaughn Road, at a point distant about four
</p>
<p>miles from Dinwiddie Court House, and advanced up the Quaker Road
</p>
<p>in the direction of Boydton Plank Road, some three miles distant. A
</p>
<p>short distance from here the trepps found a line of abandoned rebel
</p>
<p>breastworks, from which their pickets had just retired. Skirmishers
</p>
<p>were now thrown forward, and sharp firing commenced ; the skirmish
</p>
<p>ers crossing an open plateau, the further side of which Bushrod John
</p>
<p>son's rebel divisions were posted. The first brigade of Griffin's division
</p>
<p>was now ordered forward to support the skirmishers, and when within
</p>
<p>rifle-shot of the woods, a tremendous volley of musketry greeted their
</p>
<p>advance, causing them to waver and fall back. The second brigade now
</p>
<p>came up to the support of the first, which caused the latter to rally and
</p>
<p>stand firm. In the meantime, battery B, of the First United States, was
</p>
<p>got into position and commenced firing with effect. While the fight was
</p>
<p>in progress, Gen. Warren was engaged in forming his line of battle on
</p>
<p>the right and left of the Quaker Road. The enemy seeing that a large
</p>
<p>force was being moved against them, retired to a point further back.
</p>
<p>Sheridan was on the extreme left at Dinwiddie Court House ; Meade's

</p>
<p>headquarters were on the Vaughn Road, three miles beyond Hatcher's
</p>
<p>Run, and Gen. Grant's about a mile further out.
</p>
<p>March 31: t, in the morning, the rebels commenced an attack on Grant's
</p>
<p>left, near Dabney's House, and pressed it back towards Boydton
</p>
<p>Plank Road ; here their advance was checked, and the Union troops re
</p>
<p>covering the lost ground, and driving the enemy, took possession of the
</p>
<p>White Oak Road, capturing four battle flags.
</p>
<p>April 1st, Gen. Sheridan fought the battle of Five Forks, doubling up

</p>
<p>290 LIEUTENANT GENERAL GRANT.
</p>
<p>the right wing of the rebel army on the centre, and cutting a portion of
</p>
<p>it off. His triumph over Early, in the Shenandoah, was great ; and his
</p>
<p>victory secured over Longstreet this day, was both great and glorious ;
</p>
<p>with Carter, Devons, and Davis of the cavalry corps, and Griffin, Ayers,
</p>
<p>Crawford and Bartlett of the Fifth Corps, he succeeded in dividing the
</p>
<p>rebel army under Lee, and capturing 5700 prisoners, and three batteries of
</p>
<p>rebel artillery. Longstreet, after his inglorious defeat, fled first north,
</p>
<p>then westward, hoping to effect a junction with Johnston in North Caro
</p>
<p>lina. Lee's line extended from Burgess' MiU to the Appomattox.
</p>
<p>Grant believed it weak everywhere thus extended, but if massed at any
</p>
<p>one point might yet be formidable. Cannenading was kept up during
</p>
<p>all Saturday night, and he had determined to assault the line that had re
</p>
<p>mained defiant so long. It was known that Longstreet was not even
</p>
<p>making an effort to return to Petersburg. Grant's ever powerful stra-
</p>
<p>getic mind conceived the plan of making an assault with the Ninth Corps
</p>
<p>immediately in front of Petersburg, in order to induce Lee to mass his
</p>
<p>force at that important point for defence. He had already placed the
</p>
<p>Sixth, Twenty-fourth, and Second Corps, secretly in front of Lee's right.
</p>
<p>Some thought that he intended a raid on to BurksviUe, others to the South
</p>
<p>Side road, but no person except Meade and the corps commanders ever
</p>
<p>dreamed that he had matured all his plans to cut in two and annihilate
</p>
<p>the rebel army, and capture Petersburg and Richmond. Yet it was all
</p>
<p>true, and a few hours only were needed to bring it to pass. The
</p>
<p>star of American glory was about to be unveiled ; a mightier achieve
</p>
<p>ment was than history had yet recorded about to take place. The hearts
</p>
<p>of millions of the human race, unconscious of the coming hour, were
</p>
<p>to beat with gladness ; the strife would soon be over ; our last great
</p>
<p>victory soon be won. SUNDAY MORNING, APRIL 2d.
</p>
<p>Holy day, commemorative of the Resurrection  momentous time ! It

<p>the treason of one of his followers. The mighty Ruler of events has, in

<p>his own wisdom, coupled the treachery of Judas with our slave-holders'

</p>
<p>remember them together.
</p>
<p>Sunday, April 2d, at four o'clock, A. M., the time for action had now
</p>
<p>come. General Parke, in front of Petersburg, was pressing close up to
</p>
<p>the town. His divisions were, Wilcox on the right resting on the Ap
</p>
<p>pomattox ; Hartranft in the centre ; Potter, with the second division, was
</p>
<p>CAPTURE OF PETERSBURG. 291
</p>
<p>on the left, joining Wheaten of the Sixth Corps. The plan was for Wil
</p>
<p>cox to make a feint upon the rebel front on the Appomattox. It was
</p>
<p>promptly and vigorously made, the men creeping up to within a few feet
</p>
<p>of the rebel fort. At the word of command, the gallant First division
</p>
<p>sprang to its feet, and, with a yell, rushed on the work. At a quarter
</p>
<p>past four o'clock they were in the fort, having captured the garrison of
</p>
<p>fifty men and four guns. This was the feint of Wilcox. Hartranft and
</p>
<p>Potter advanced about the same time, and in the same manner, stealing
</p>
<p>up under caver of darkness, they, without firing a gun, sprang forward,
</p>
<p>capturing four forts, twenty-seven guns, and hundreds of prisoners.
</p>
<p>Thus at daylight Parke, without loss, had gained possession of the rebel
</p>
<p>line in his front. The Sixth Corps had simultaneously begun their work.
</p>
<p>Wheaton on the right, Seymour in the centre, and Getty on the left,
</p>
<p>joining at Fort Sampson the new line of the Twenty-fourth Corps, with
</p>
<p>Foster's Division on the right. Wright's Corps had to sustain a voUey
</p>
<p>in their advance, but they carried the rebel line, and not five minutes
</p>
<p>elapsed from the time Wright gave the signal to storm, before Gens.
</p>
<p>Seymour, Wheaton, and Getty were over the line and in possession of
</p>
<p>all the rebel guns. AU the regiments did their duty. In the first charge
</p>
<p>Wheaton took twelve pieces of artiUery, and nearly the entire Mississippi
</p>
<p>Brigade of Heth's Division ; thus, by five o'clock, the rebels were driven
</p>
<p>from all their outer works on the south and west of Petersburg. At
</p>
<p>seven o'clock, the Second and Twenty-fourth Corps began the work as
</p>
<p>signed them. Turner and Foster, of the Twenty-fourth Corps, made the
</p>
<p>assault and carried the rifle lines with little loss, while the Second Corps
</p>
<p>advanced immediately on the opposite side of Hatcher's Run. The ad
</p>
<p>vance of these corps was a gradual ascent all the way. Colonel Olmstead
</p>
<p>and Colonel Mclvor, of the first and second brigades, rushed into the
</p>
<p>two forts before them, capturing five guns and a large number of pris
</p>
<p>oners, with the loss of only ten men. The Nineteenth Massachusetts
</p>
<p>and the Seventh Michigan, the far East and far West, join hands this
</p>
<p>Sunday morning in the " last ditch" of the rebellion. Other forts were
</p>
<p>taken by New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey troops. Thus by
</p>
<p>eight o'clock the entire rebel line, from the Appomattox to Burgess' MiU,
</p>
<p>had everywhere been broken, and the Sixth Corps had swung round

</p>
<p>and was facing Petersburg from the west. The Twenty-fourth Cprps
</p>
<p>was marching frcm Hatcher's Run east inside the rebel line, and the Sec
</p>
<p>ond Corps in the same direction on the Boydton Road. Every soldier
</p>
<p>looked as if he understood the mighty events taking place. The smile of
</p>
<p>triumph was on every lip, the sparkle of joy in every eye.'
</p>
<p>General Grant having left his headquarters at Dabney Mills to over
</p>
<p>look the work yet to he done, came riding along the lines on a trot, cheer
</p>
<p>upon cheer everywhere saluted him, and nothing ever equaled the
</p>
<p>292 LIEUTENANT GENERAL GRANT.
</p>
<p>enthusiasm. The mUitary genius of Napoleon, in his Italian campaigns,
</p>
<p>was now growing dim. Few things in the annals of war can compete
</p>
<p>with the manifestations of military genius that were this day taking place.
</p>
<p>The three outer lines of fortifications, which consisted of isolated forts,
</p>
<p>had all been carried ; but the fourth, and last, was one of great strength,
</p>
<p>and looked frowningly down from the slight range of hills upon which it
</p>
<p>was located. At nine o'clock, Wheaton still onthe right, Seymour having
</p>
<p>swung to the left, tearing up the South Side railroad, Getty in the cen
</p>
<p>tre, each hour was eclipsing the other in scenes of indescribable gran
</p>
<p>deur. The corps were all forming in short range of the rebel works as
</p>
<p>leisurely as if on dress parade. The Sixth Corps advanced at double-
</p>
<p>quick, never stopping to fire, with a wild yell of delight, over they
</p>
<p>went, turning the heavy guns and sending the iron hail after the flying
</p>
<p>foe. Victory was now traveling with the Second Corps, for Miles, Mott,
</p>
<p>Smyth and Humphrey were there. The Sixth Corps was also at work. A
</p>
<p>large number of houses were now in flames, the columns of smoke rising
</p>
<p>from them inheavy clouds, shrouding the scenes for the moment, but soon
</p>
<p>lifted by the wind, with it floated off to the northeast.
</p>
<p>Grant had now laid out a programme. Meade, Wright, and Gibbons'
</p>
<p>commands were appointed to execute it. The forts selected, at the
</p>
<p>sound of the bugle, were soon taken, the rebels making but a feeble re
</p>
<p>sistance. The star spangled banner could now be seen floating above
</p>
<p>nearly all the heretofore strong rebel works. The Union army began to
</p>
<p>be assured of the magnitude of its triumphs ; deeds of daring, and hero
</p>
<p>ism, were everywhere being displayed ; to mention the names of some
</p>
<p>would be doing injustice to aU  it was an army of heroes.
</p>
<p>The Second and Fifth Corps were sent to a point to intercept the antici
</p>
<p>pated retreat of Lee ; this somewhat weakened our force and the rebels
</p>
<p>made a more vigorous stand against the Ninth Corps. Lee was thero
</p>
<p>superintending, and for a time advantage seemed on the rebel side. Our
</p>
<p>lihe stood firm, fighting like heroes, and finally, after superhuman effort,
</p>
<p>the rebels were driven back. We lost one fort. Reinforcements of 5000
</p>
<p>men had been ordered from City Point to supply, as far as possible, the
</p>
<p>deficiency created by the withdrawal of the Second and Fifth Corps, which
</p>
<p>had been sent to a point to cut off Lee's retreat. At 11 o'clock Meade,

</p>
<p>Wright, and Gibbon were still at work. The Sixth Corps was now
</p>
<p>shifting to the right in plain view and easy range of Lee's interior line.
</p>
<p>At this hour all was still, not a gun or a shout was heard, not a horse
</p>
<p>neighed, not a drum or bugle sounded ; the field was still as death.
</p>
<p>Suddenlya gun on one of the rebel forts to the left belched forth a
</p>
<p>duU report, then another and another ; the rebel chief struggling like a
</p>
<p>child in the hand of a giant. At twelve o'clock it was discovered that
</p>
<p>Lee was retreating acress the Appomattox on three separate pontoons.
</p>
<p>THE FALL OF RICHMOND. 293
</p>
<p>Jnst above the city huge fires were already raging in the town ; the reb
</p>
<p>els had applied the torch to accelerate their own ruin. At two o'clock,
</p>
<p>the Sixth and Twenty-fourth Corps, at the sound pf the bugle, cemmenced
</p>
<p>to assault some of the remaining forts still making a show pf resistance
</p>
<p>in that part ef the field. They were som carried, and the starry flag
</p>
<p>hoisted over them ; at the same time the rebel fort that had been taken
</p>
<p>from us was again recaptured. Gen. Collins, from City Point, headed the
</p>
<p>charge ; the rebels poured in a terrible fire, but after a severe struggle
</p>
<p>the fort was captured, and at half past three o'clock the " last ditch" of
</p>
<p>the rebelUon was reached. Our prisoners were now like the sands on
</p>
<p>the sea shore, and the marines and sailors from Porter's fleet were
</p>
<p>brought to guard them.
</p>
<p>The rebel rams, Virginia and Rappahannock, which were lying on the
</p>
<p>James, some distance from Howlett House, were blown up about mid
</p>
<p>night on the second, shaking the earth like a volcano. The grandest
</p>
<p>scenes of history were now taking place on the works around Rich
</p>
<p>mond. The rebels were engaged in making a great show through the
</p>
<p>day, and all their engineering was brought into play to continue the de
</p>
<p>ception up to twelve o'clock at night. Gen. Weitzel suspected the ob
</p>
<p>ject of the grand display, and when he saw the lurid light hanging over
</p>
<p>the rebel Capital it told him that the hour had almost come.
</p>
<p>Gen. Weitzel immediately started, and entered Richmond at 8:15, on the
</p>
<p>morning of the 3d of April, 1865 , Thus the great Capital of treason and
</p>
<p>rebellion, which had defied the Union army for four years, fell. Rich
</p>
<p>mond and Petersburg were now captured, hundreds of guns and thous
</p>
<p>ands of prisoners taken, Lee's army demoralized, shattered, broken, and
</p>
<p>driven to the four winds. This is the history of the day. How can it
</p>
<p>be told ? what pen can write it ? or who comprehend the magnitude of
</p>
<p>tho issues decided by this mighty event ? Two hundred and forty-five
</p>
<p>years ago, on this very spot, our traffic in human flesh began. During
</p>
<p>this long period the earnest prayers and agonizing groans of an outraged
</p>
<p>people had been ascending to the throne of God. They have not been
</p>
<p>in vain. Let it forever be rembered that Washington gave us a country,
</p>
<p>but this day's victory made it free.

<p>termined that he should not have an opportunity again to recruit his
</p>
<p>shattered army. Lee's retreat exhibited every sign of a rout, the path
</p>
<p>strewn with wagons, ambulances, dead and wounded horses and mules,
</p>
<p>caissons, boxes of ammunition thrown out to lighten the load, mess uten
</p>
<p>sils, arms, accoutrements, blankets, clothing, loose cartridges, and simi

<p>then on to Mamozine Church, then across the Appomattox on to Amelia

<p>Court House, forty-seven miles southwest of Richmond. Gen. Grant was

<p>and Deatonsville, and Sheridan's cavalry now at Plainville intercepting

<p>him on his way to Lynchburg, left nothing for Lee but surrender.
</p>

<p>SURRENDER OF LEE. 295
</p>
<p>LEE S ENTIRE LOSS.
</p>
<p>In the battles around Petersburg and in the pursuit, Lee lost over ten
</p>
<p>thousand men killed and wounded, and twenty thousand men in prisoners
</p>
<p>and deserters, including those taken in battle, and those picked up in
</p>
<p>pursuit; embracing aUarms of the service  teamsters, hospital force, and
</p>
<p>everything  from sixteen to eighteen thousand men were surrendered by
</p>
<p>Lee. As only fifteen thousand muskets and about thirty pieces of artil
</p>
<p>lery were surrendered, the available fighting force could hardly have
</p>
<p>exceeded fifteen or twenty thousand men. Our total captures of artiUery
</p>
<p>during the battles and pursuit, and at the surrender, amounted to
</p>
<p>about one hundred and seventy guns. Three or four hundred wagons
</p>
<p>were handed over.
</p>
<p>In the terms of surrender, the officers gave their own paroles, and
</p>
<p>each officer gave his parole for the men within his command. The fol
</p>
<p>lowing is the form of the personal parole of officers, copied from the orig
</p>
<p>inal document given by Lee and a portion of his staff:
</p>
<p>" We, the undersigned prisoners of war belonging to the army of
</p>
<p>Northern Virginia, having been this day surrendered by General R. E.

</p>
<p>they reside. " Geore H. Sharps, General Assist, Provost-Marshal.' '
</p>
<p>296 LIEUTENANT GENERAL GRANT.
</p>
<p>The obligation of officers for the subdivisions under their command is
</p>
<p>in form as follows :
</p>
<p>" I, the undersigned, commanding officer of , do, for the within-
</p>
<p>named prisoners of war, belonging to the army of Northern Virginia,
</p>
<p>who have been this day surrendered by General Robert E. Lee, Confed
</p>
<p>erate States Army, commanding said army, to Lieutenant-General Grant,
</p>
<p>commanding the armies of the United States, hereby give my solemn pa

<p>role of honor that the within-named shall not hereafter serve in the
</p>
<p>armies of the Confederate States of America, or in mihtary or any ca

<p>pacity whatever against the United States of America, or render aid to

<p>"The within-named will not be disturbed by the United States authori
</p>
<p>ties so long as they observe their parele and the laws in force where they

</p>
<p>The surrender of Lee was followed by the voluntary surrender of most
</p>
<p>of the regular troops of the enemy in the Shenandoah.
</p>
<p>THE REBEL FORCES IN ALABAMA, MISSISSIPPI, AND EAST LOUISIANA, SURRENDER
</p>
<p>TO GENERAL CANBY.
</p>
<p>- On the 4th of May, 1865, General Richard Taylor, commanding the
</p>
<p>rebel forces in Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana, surrendered to
</p>
<p>Major-General Canby, and this closed up our account with the rebels east
</p>
<p>of the Mississippi river.
</p>
<p>GENERAL SHERIDAN GOES TO NEW ORLEANS.  SURRENDER OF KIRBY SMITH.
</p>
<p>Beyond the Mississippi, Kirby Smith showed a determination to hold
</p>
<p>out and prolong the war. General Grant resolved to use efficient meas
</p>
<p>ures to bring him also to terms, and a powerful expedition was fitted out
</p>
<p>at Fortress Monroe, and Major-General Philip Sheridan was assigned
</p>
<p>to its command. The General proceeded forthwith by way of the
</p>
<p>Mississippi river to New Orleans ;  before reaching that point, Smith had
</p>
<p>heard of the surrender of Lee, Johnston, and Taylor, and he too accepted
</p>
<p>the terms granted to Lee, and surrendered the forces under his command.
</p>
<p>Thus all the armies of the rebellion were captured, conquered and
</p>
<p>subdued, and the arch traitor Davis captured while endeavoring to
</p>
<p>escape. All honor to General Grant, the galant officers and brave men

</p>
<p>ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>HIS ANCESTORS, HIS BIRTH, HIS LIFE, AND
</p>
<p>ASSASSINATION.
</p>
<p>The ancestors of Abraham Lincoln, like those of General Sherman,
</p>
<p>came from England. Many of the Israelites think his name Abraham
</p>
<p>peculiarly significant of a distant Jewish origin, while our friends, the
</p>
<p>Quakers, claim they have strong evidence that they emigrated to this
</p>
<p>country with the founder of Pennsylvania and entertained a similar reli
</p>
<p>gious beUef. Raymond, in his Life of Lincoln remarks, " It is difficult
</p>
<p>to trace them farther back than to their place of residence in Berks coun
</p>
<p>ty, Pennsylvania. As the territory had previously been settled only by
</p>
<p>the Swedes and Finns, there is a strong probability that Lincoln's'ances-
</p>
<p>tors came to this country with the colony of Friends sent out by William
</p>
<p>Penn at the close of the year 1681. This we know to1 be tradition and
</p>
<p>have no doubt of its truth. In 1750 a part of the family (it had then
</p>
<p>been Uving and multiplying in that region for near seventy years) re
</p>
<p>moved to what is now known as Rockingham County, Virginia, where old
</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln was born. We have been unable to learn his father's
</p>
<p>name. Abraham here married a Virginia woman. About three years after
</p>
<p>they were married, and when their son, Thomas Lincoln, was two years
</p>
<p>old, they concluded to change their location and go a little further west.
</p>
<p>Thus in 1780, the grandfather of our late President left Virginia, and
</p>
<p>with his famUy settled on Floyd's Creek, in the region now known as
</p>
<p>Bullitt County, Kentucky. Erecting a log cabin to protect his little
</p>
<p>family from the wet and cold, he soon began to gather around him the
</p>
<p>rude and indispensable necessities of frontier Ufe. He was perfectly
</p>
<p>satisfied and his Wife contented in this their new and distant home. But
</p>
<p>in 1784 he was engaged in clearing a piece of land about four miles dis
</p>
<p>tant from his house, procuring subsistence for his family, consisting now
</p>
<p>of his wife and five children, three sons and two daughters.
</p>
<p>While thus engaged in honest toil the strife with the Indians began,
</p>
<p>and he was destined to be a victim. He Was murdered by an Indian

</p>
<p>while at work in the clearing above mentioned, and his scalped remains
</p>
<p>298 ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>found the next morning near where he had been working. His widow
</p>
<p>was now left with a large family in a lonely wUderness and with but
</p>
<p>scanty means to support them. Poverty soon made it necessary that the
</p>
<p>little group should part. AH except the second son, found homes in
</p>
<p>other sections of Kentucky ; he secured a place in Indiana. Thomas,
</p>
<p>who was the oldest, being a little over six years, remained with his
</p>
<p>mother until he was twelve ; he then left for a short time, but soon after
</p>
<p>wards returned and continued to live with and support her until he was
</p>
<p>twenty-eight years of age. This carries us to the year 1806, when
</p>
<p>Thomas Lincoln concluded to take to himself a wife. Like his father, he
</p>
<p>chose a Virgin'a woman for a companion. He was married to Miss Nancy
</p>
<p>Hanks in the latter part of the winter of 1806, and their first child was
</p>
<p>born (a girl) in the month of March, 1807. They were a plain, and un
</p>
<p>assuming couple. He had received no education, and she could read but
</p>
<p>could not write. They were persons of strong natural abilities, exem
</p>
<p>plary in their private life, both being members of the Baptist Church.
</p>
<p>Soon after they were married they removed and settled near Elizabeth-
</p>
<p>town, Hardin county, Kentucky, and there, February 12th, 1809, Abraham
</p>
<p>Lincoln, the illustrious personage and subject of this narrative was born.
</p>
<p>Two years afterwards another son was born, but he died in infancy.
</p>
<p>The daughter, the oldest of the family lived to years of womanhood,
</p>
<p>married, but subsequently died without issue. This, we believe, is all
</p>
<p>that is yet authentically known about the ancestors of this illustrious man.
</p>
<p>The Hon. Robert Dale Owen, we understand, is engaged in getting to
</p>
<p>gether a very complete and elaborate history of Mr. Lincoln. Perhaps
</p>
<p>he may be able to throw some Ught on the period between 1681 and
</p>
<p>1750. We ourselves shall wait with great anxiety to receive what new light
</p>
<p>his extensive research and eloquent pen can give on this important and in
</p>
<p>teresting subject. At seven years old, " Little Abe" (as he was famil
</p>
<p>iarly called) was sent to school. His father determined as far as possi
</p>
<p>ble to give him an education. A Mr. Hazel who kept a school, and Zach-
</p>
<p>ariah Riney, a Roman Catholic, were the persons that first gave him the
</p>
<p>rudiments of instruction. Riney was some way connected with a Catholic
</p>
<p>Institute that the Trappists had founded on Pottinger's Creek. Be
</p>
<p>coming annoyed at the obstructions slavery was placing in the way of

</p>
<p>industry and enterprise, Thomas Lincoln concluded to leave Kentucky,
</p>
<p>and settle in free territory. Thus, in 1817, he traded his home in Hardin
</p>
<p>county for about three hundred dollars worth of merchandize, and built a
</p>
<p>flat-boat on the Rolling Fork River, placed all his earthly valuables on
</p>
<p>board, including his family, and floated out iDto the Ohio and made for
</p>
<p>Thompson's Ferry, opposite Spencer county, Indiana, the county and re
</p>
<p>gion ho had previously selected for his new and future home. He had
</p>
<p>ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 299
</p>
<p>with him three horses and pne ccw, and it tppk him seven days to get
</p>
<p>their scanty household goods eighteen miles back from the river bank,
</p>
<p>having to cut his way through the woods, some days only advancing
</p>
<p>three mues. When they arrived at the spot, with the kind assistance of
</p>
<p>a few neighbors, Thomas Lincoln soon erected a nice log house eighteen
</p>
<p>feet square, with some slabs laid across the logs overhead, forming an up
</p>
<p>stairs which was got to by a rough ladder in the corner. The loft was
</p>
<p>Abe's bedroom and there for years he contentedly slept with one coarse
</p>
<p>blanket for his mattress and another for his covering. What a future
</p>
<p>was before this innocent youth as he sweetly slept in his rude but happy
</p>
<p>home. If he had been told he could not have comprehended it, and the
</p>
<p>unbeheving would not have believed it. Dressed in a suit of buckskin
</p>
<p>and a cap made from a raccoon skin he , became the favorite with the set
</p>
<p>tlers, and his parents were devotedly fond of him. He had now when
</p>
<p>nine years old become remarkably fond of books, reading a few chapters
</p>
<p>in the Bible daily for the edification of his mother, but she could not
</p>
<p>have imagined in her wildest dreams the future eminence of her beloved
</p>
<p>son. But while engaged in moulding the future character of her little
</p>
<p>boy, the faithful mother died. This sad bereavement occurred when
</p>
<p>Abe was about ten years old. Ministers of the gospel were seldom to
</p>
<p>be met in this wild region, and it was not until twelve months after her
</p>
<p>death that Parson Elkins was induced by a kind and touching letter from
</p>
<p>her Uttle son to come and preach her funeral sermon. In his sermon
</p>
<p>the Parson frequently alluded to the touching eloquence of the letter he
</p>
<p>received, which afterwards served to bring Abraham's pen into frequent
</p>
<p>employment in writing letters for the neighbors. Two years after Mrs.
</p>
<p>Lincoln's death, Mr. Lincoln married Mrs. Sally Johnston, a widow with
</p>
<p>three chUdren, who resided at Elizabethtown, Kentucky. Fortunately
</p>
<p>she was admirably adapted to fiUthe vacancy in Mr. Lincoln's family,
</p>
<p>and a superior woman between whom and Abe a most devoted attach
</p>
<p>ment sprung up, and continued during the twelve years that Thomas
</p>
<p>Lincoln resided in Indiana. He continued to send Abraham to school.
</p>
<p>A Mr. Dorsey, who a few months ago, was still living in Schuyler Coun
</p>
<p>ty, Illinois, and a Mr. Crawford were the teadhers. Ramsay and Weem's
</p>
<p>Life of Washington were among the first, then came Life of Henry Clay,

</p>
<p>jEsop's Fables, and Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress ; aU these he eagerly
</p>
<p>perused, and we have no doubt the latter work served to perfect him in
</p>
<p>a great measure, in that style which was in after years so peculiar to his
</p>
<p>pen. After he left school, until he was eighteen years old, he labored in the
</p>
<p>woods cutting down trees, clearing the ground, and splitting rails.
</p>
<p>Abraham had now lived to be nineteen years old. A New Orleans trader
</p>
<p>resided near by, and his son in the spring of 1828 was about to make a
</p>
<p>trip on a flatboat with a valuable cargo down the Mississippi to the Cres-
</p>
<p>300 ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>eent City. Abraham hired for the trip at ten dollars a month. On their
</p>
<p>way down, a band of robbers, great numbers of whom infested that
</p>
<p>stream in those early times, attempted to seize the boat with aU its valu
</p>
<p>able cargo, but after a spirited contest with the boat's crew, were re
</p>
<p>pulsed and driven back. The Trader and Abraham returned from their
</p>
<p>trip to New Orleans in the summer. His father, Thomas Lincoln, had
</p>
<p>inherited that peculiar distaste that aU frontiersmen have against the ad
</p>
<p>vancing tide of civilization, and he concluded to seek a new home ; with
</p>
<p>him, like all other backwoodsmen, The heaven of eternal earthly rest, i
</p>
<p>Is always found a Httle farther west.
</p>
<p>In March, 1830, Thomas Lincoln moved his family to Illinois. After
</p>
<p>fifteen days travel with oxen, (Abraham driving one team) he came to
</p>
<p>a site of (ten acres) on the north side of the Sangamon river, ten miles
</p>
<p>west of Decatur, Macon county. The father and Abraham soon erected
</p>
<p>a log cabin, and the latter split sufficient rails to fence their new farm.
</p>
<p>The father soon became tired of his home in Macon county, and resolved
</p>
<p>to move to Coles county, about seventy miles distant away. Abraham
</p>
<p>objected to his father again moving, and in the spring signified his in
</p>
<p>tention of leaving home and seeking his fortune among strangers. The
</p>
<p>tidings were received by his parents and friends with the most profound
</p>
<p>sorrow. But he went westward to Menard county and worked on a farm
</p>
<p>for Mr. Armstrong in the vicinity of Petersburg, during the ensuing
</p>
<p>summer and winter. This prevented his father from moving to Coles
</p>
<p>county and he settled down on the upper waters of the Kaskaskia and
</p>
<p>Embarras, where he died in his seventy-third year, January 17th, 1851.
</p>
<p>In 1831, Abraham again made a trip to New Orleans in the capacity of a
</p>
<p>flatboatman, returning that summer. His employer was so pleased with
</p>
<p>him he gave him a clerkship in his mill and store at New Salem, about
</p>
<p>twenty miles from Springfield. He was a most dutiful son, devoting the
</p>
<p>principal part of his earnings to keep his father's family, who were then
</p>
<p>very poor. In 1832, Black Hawk was concentrating a large Indian force
</p>
<p>on the Illinois river. Major StiUman, with his fampus two hundred and
</p>
<p>seventy men, had previously been defeated by him, en the 14th of
</p>
<p>-May at Sangamon Creek, Black Hawk at the time having only forty
</p>
<p>warriors engaged in the fight. The Governor of Uhnois was now calling

<p>for -troops to punish the Indians, and a recruiting office -being opened at
</p>
<p>New Salem, Abraham Lincoln was the first to put down his name. The
</p>
<p>company was soon organized, and the men unanimously chose him for
</p>
<p>their captain. They marched to Beardsfown, and from there to the seat
</p>
<p><of war. The term of enlistment being out, without hesitation he re-enlisted
</p>
<p>in another company as a private, where he continued until its term of
</p>
<p>ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 301
</p>
<p>enlistment had also expired. Like most Kentuckians he was an admirer
</p>
<p>and supporter of Henry Clay, and after his return from the war was cho
</p>
<p>sen by the Whig party, in New Salem, as a candidate for the legislature
</p>
<p>of Illinois. He was defeated ; but out of the 284 votes cast in the town
</p>
<p>of New Salem, he received 177. This was the first and last time he wa3
</p>
<p>ever beaten before the people. This contest over (although not elected,
</p>
<p>his opponent only led him a few votes) he purchased a store and stock
</p>
<p>of goods on credit, and was appointed Postmaster at New Salem ; but
</p>
<p>store-keeping was to him unprofitable, and he sold out, and for a year
</p>
<p>was engaged in surveying. John Calhoun, afterwards president of the
</p>
<p>former Lecompton Constitutional Convention of Kansas, being his tutor,
</p>
<p>he still continued to act as postmaster of the town. Reverses came upon
</p>
<p>him, and his surveying implements were seized for debt and sold by the
</p>
<p>sheriff of the county. In 1834 he was again nominated foT the legislature
</p>
<p>and was elected by a very large majerity. Ia 1835, 1838. and 1840, was
</p>
<p>re-elected to the same effice. During his first term in the legislature he
</p>
<p>cenceived the idea cf studying law, and through the aid o" Hon. John
</p>
<p>T. Stuart, who placed in his possession the necessary books ; and he was
</p>
<p>admitted to the bar in 1836 ; and on April 15th, 1837, he settled perma
</p>
<p>nently in Springfield, Sangamon county, where he entered into partner
</p>
<p>ship with John T. Stuart. Many thrilling incidents occurred with him
</p>
<p>during his legal profession. The Mr. Armstrong whom he had worked
</p>
<p>for in Menard county, after he first lef; his father's house, had died, and
</p>
<p>his oldest son had been arrested for murder and was confined in the jail
</p>
<p>of that county awaiting trial. As soon as Mr. Lincol i heard of this
</p>
<p>sad occurrence, he sent a letter to Mrs. Armstrong, offering to return
</p>
<p>her kindness to him during the time he lived in her family, by volun
</p>
<p>teering his services gratuitously for her son's defence. They were glad
</p>
<p>ly accepted, and by a discrepancy in the testimony of the main witness
</p>
<p>against the boy, whp swore that the deed was committed at precisely
</p>
<p>half past nine o'clock, and that he saw it plain, for the moon was shining
</p>
<p>clearly. Mr. Lincoln showed, after reviewing all the other evidence,
</p>
<p>that the moon did not rise until an hour later than the time stated by the
</p>
<p>witness, therefore the whole testimony was a base fabrication ; the jury
</p>
<p>so viewed it, and returned a verdict of not guilty. At this moment the

<p>widow dropped into the arms of her son who hftedher up, and told her
</p>
<p>to look on him as before, free and innoeent. Then with the words,
</p>
<p>" Where is Mr. Lincoln?" he rushed across the room and grasped him
</p>
<p>by the hand, while his heart was too full for utterance. Lincoln turned
</p>
<p>his eyes to the west where the sun still lingered in view, and then, turn.
</p>
<p>ing to the youth, said, " It is not yet sundown and you are free." Mr.
</p>
<p>Lincoln loved his feUowmen with all the strength of his good nature, and
</p>
<p>his voice touching, and always cheerful made his presence a source of
</p>
<p>joy to the cempany.
</p>
<p>302 ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>In March, 1837, on account pf a series of resolutions being offered by
</p>
<p>some one sustaining the ultra southern view of slavery in the Illinois
</p>
<p>Legislature, Mr. Lincoln offered a protest against slavery, signed by
</p>
<p>Daniel Stone and himself, Representatives of Sangamon county, Illinois.
</p>
<p>For many years Mr. Lincoln lived a bachelor in the family of Hon. Wil
</p>
<p>liam Butler in Springfield. On November 4th, 1842, he married Miss Mary
</p>
<p>Todd, daughter of Hon. Robert S. Todd of Lexington, Kentucky. In
</p>
<p>every campaign from 1836 to 1852, Mr. Lincoln was a Whig candidate for
</p>
<p>Presidential Elector, and in 1844 stumped the state of Illinois for Henry
</p>
<p>Clay. In 1846, he was elected to Congress from the central district of
</p>
<p>IUinois. That state sent seven representatives that year, and all were
</p>
<p>Democrats except Mr. Lincoln. On the question of the Mexican War he
</p>
<p>never could be induced to give his vote in Congress that the war had
</p>
<p>been righteously begun, but he voted for every act brought forward to
</p>
<p>procure money to pay, or give land warrants to the soldiers. His votes
</p>
<p>in Congress were uniformly given against the institution of slavery, and
</p>
<p>he voted more than forty different times in favor of the Wilmot Proviso.
</p>
<p>In 1849 Mr. Lincoln was a candidate before the Legislature of Illinois
</p>
<p>for U. S. Senator ; but his political opponents being in the majority, Gen
</p>
<p>eral Shields was chosen. He was subsequently offered the nomination
</p>
<p>for Governor of Illinois, but declined it in favor of Mr. Bissell. In June,
</p>
<p>1858, the Republican Convention assembled at Springfield, and nomin
</p>
<p>ated him as their candidate for the United States Senate.
</p>
<p>The contest that followed was the most remarkable ever witnessed in
</p>
<p>the country. Mr. Douglas, his opponent, had few, if any, superiors as
</p>
<p>a political debater. From county to county they both traveled, often in
</p>
<p>the same car, and face to face. These great champions argued the im
</p>
<p>portant points before thousands of their fellow citizens.
</p>
<p>During the campaign, Mr. Lincoln paid the following tribute to the Dec
</p>
<p>laration of Independence :
</p>
<p>" These communities, (the thirteen colonies,) by their representatives
</p>
<p>in old Independence Hall, said to the world of men, ' We hold these
</p>
<p>truths to be self-evident, that all men are born equal ; that they are en
</p>
<p>dowed by their Creator with inalienable rights ; that among these are
</p>
<p>life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. ' This was their majestic in

</p>
<p>terpretation of the economy of the universe. This was their lofty, and
</p>
<p>wise, and noble understanding of the justice of the Creator to his crea
</p>
<p>tures. Yes, gentlemen, to all his creatures, to the whole great family of
</p>
<p>man. In their enlightened belief, nothing stamped with the Divine im
</p>
<p>age and likeness was sent into the world to be trodden on, and degraded,
</p>
<p>and imbruted by its fellows. They grasped not only the race of men
</p>
<p>then living, but they reached forward and seized upon the furthest pos
</p>
<p>terity. They created a beacon to guide their children and their chil-
</p>
<p>ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 303
</p>
<p>dren's children, and the countless myriads who should inhabit the earth
</p>
<p>in other ages. Wise statesmen as they were, they knew the tendency of
</p>
<p>prosperity to breed tyrants, and so they established these great self-evi
</p>
<p>dent truths that when, in the distant future, some man, some faction,
</p>
<p>some interest, should set up the doctrine that none but rich men, or none
</p>
<p>but white men, or none but Anglo-Saxon white men, were entitled to life,
</p>
<p>Uberty, and the pursuit of happiness, their posterity might look up again
</p>
<p>to the Declaration of Independence, and take courage to renew the battle
</p>
<p>which their fathers began, so that truth, and justice, and mercy, and all
</p>
<p>the humane and Christian virtues might not be extinguished from the
</p>
<p>land ; so that no man would hereafter dare to limit and circumscribe the
</p>
<p>great principles on which the temple of liberty was being built.
</p>
<p>" Now, my countrymen, if you have been taught doctrines conflicting
</p>
<p>with the great landmarks of the Declaration of Independence ; if you have
</p>
<p>listened to suggestions which would take away from its grandeur, and
</p>
<p>mutilate the fair symmetry of its proportions ; if you have been inclined
</p>
<p>to believe that all men are not created equal in those inalienable rights
</p>
<p>enumerated by our chart of liberty, let me entreat you to come back 
</p>
<p>return to the fountain whose waters spring close by the blepd of the Rev
</p>
<p>olution. Think nothing of me, take no thought for the political fate of
</p>
<p>any man whomsoever, but come back to the truths that are in the Decla
</p>
<p>ration of Independence.
</p>
<p>" Vou may do anything with me you choose, if you will but heed these
</p>
<p>sacred principles. Vou may not only defeat me for the Senate, but you
</p>
<p>may take me and put me to death. While pretending no indifference to
</p>
<p>earthly honors, I do claim to be actuated in this contest by something
</p>
<p>higher than an anxiety for office. I charge you to drop every paltry and
</p>
<p>insignificant thought for any man's success. It is nothing ; I am nothing ;
</p>
<p>Judge Douglas is nothing. But do not destroy that immortal emblem of
</p>
<p>humanity  the Declaration of American Independence."
</p>
<p>The result of this animated campaign was a vote of 126,084 for the Re
</p>
<p>publican candidates, 121,940 for the Douglas Democrats, and 5,091 for
</p>
<p>Lecompton candidates, but Mr. Douglas was elected United States Sena
</p>
<p>tor by the Legislature in which his supporters had a majority of eight on
</p>
<p>joint ballot. But Mr. Lincoln's friends were no way disheartened, and

<p>determined to make him their next Presidential candidate ; and at the
</p>
<p>Republican Convention, held at Chicago, in May, 1860, Abraham Lincoln
</p>
<p>for President, and Hannibal Hamlin for Vice President, became the nom
</p>
<p>inees ; suffice it to say, this ticket was elected. The trials and troubles
</p>
<p>of his first term we have given in another part of this book.
</p>
<p>You can not fail to have noticed the solemn and sometimes almost
</p>
<p>mournful strain that pervades manypf his addresses. When he left
</p>
<p>304 ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>Springfield in 1861 to assume the Presidency, his farewell words were as
</p>
<p>follows :
</p>
<p>" My Friends : No one not in my position can appreciate the sad
</p>
<p>ness I feel at this parting. To this people I owe all that I am. Here I
</p>
<p>have lived more than a quarter of a century ; here my children were
</p>
<p>born, and here one of them lies buried. I know not how soon I shall
</p>
<p>see you again. A duty devolves upon me whioh is, perhaps, greater
</p>
<p>than that which has devolved upon any other man since the days of
</p>
<p>Washington. He never would have succeeded except for the aid of Di
</p>
<p>vine Providence, upon which he at all times relied. I feel that I can not
</p>
<p>succeed without the same Divine aid which sustained him, and on the
</p>
<p>same Almighty B:ing I place my reliance for support ; and I hope you,
</p>
<p>my friends, will all pray that I may receive that Divine assistance, with
</p>
<p>out which I can not succeed, but with which success is certain. Again,
</p>
<p>I bid yo"ti all an affectionate farewell."
</p>
<p>He was re-nominated by the same party June 7th, at Baltimore, Mary
</p>
<p>land, for a second term, with Andrew Johnson for Vice President. A
</p>
<p>complete account of the campaign of 1864, and Mr. Lincoln's triumphant
</p>
<p>re-election, can be found in another part of this book.
</p>
<p>ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>Sadly and sorrowfully do we commence this melancholy story. We
</p>
<p>had published a full and complete account of the Assassination of Presi
</p>
<p>dents Harrison and Taylor, with facts about the National Hotel poison
</p>
<p>ing, wherein the South endeavored to get rid of Buchanan so as to have
</p>
<p>Breckenridge for President, and we warned Mr. Lincoln personally be
</p>
<p>fore his reelection by placing the first 128 pages of this book in his
</p>
<p>hands ; but his patriotic devotion to his country led him to disregard aU
</p>
<p>intimations of personal danger. The exalted and holy purpose of de
</p>
<p>stroying slavery, and preventing his country's ruin were everywhere
</p>
<p>uppermost in his mind ; above all barbarity himself, it was not easy to
</p>
<p>convince him of its existence in others. But while we kept sounding the
</p>
<p>alarm like a fire-bell in the night, fawning sycophants who sought him
</p>
<p>only for place, refused to aid us; but rather threw cold water on all
</p>
<p>the incontrovertible facts we produced or warnings we gave.

<p>The press of the whole country with the exception of the New York
</p>
<p>Evening Post, The Independent, The Brooklyn Union, and a few others re
</p>
<p>fused even to say one word about the Assassination of Presidents Harri
</p>
<p>son and Taylor. In fact, the nation was lulled into fancied security by
</p>
<p>those holding the positions of sentinels on guard. * The democratic lead
</p>
<p>ers did not care to have it known, that slavery had murdered both, and
</p>
<p>the only Presidents the opositionhad placed in power. The other party
</p>
<p>ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 305
</p>
<p>leaders believed it all, but theught it policy tp hpld it back ; deeming it
</p>
<p>inexpedient to give to the world an account of these monstrous political
</p>
<p>crimes. Some of the ministers of the gospel barely hinted that the
</p>
<p>deaths of Harrison and Taylor were mysterious ; but it was not until after
</p>
<p>President Lincoln's Assassination that any one of them came forward
</p>
<p>and boldly announced it to be an established fact. Reverend Henry
</p>
<p>Ward Beecher in an article written for The New York Ledger of the 20th
</p>
<p>of May 1865, says :
</p>
<p>"There is, also, the gravest reasons to believe that all moral restrictions
</p>
<p>were yielded, and thatcrimes the most infamous were deliberately em
</p>
<p>ployed as the means of promoting the bad ends of these conspirators.
</p>
<p>Those who know most of the interior of affairs, scarc61y doubt that Harri
</p>
<p>son was poisoned that Tyler might fulfill Southern plans of war with
</p>
<p>Mexico. With even stronger conviction is it affirmed that Taylor was
</p>
<p>poisoned, that a less stern successor might give a suppler instrument to
</p>
<p>Southern managers. Who doubts, now, that it was attempted to poison
</p>
<p>Buchanan at the National Hotel, and leave Breckenridge in his room ? It
</p>
<p>is a matter of verified history that efforts were made to take off Mr. Lin
</p>
<p>coln before he should be inaugurated. And now, the whole world is
</p>
<p>astounded by the hideous crime by which he has been removed from
</p>
<p>life. " This perspective is needed to reveal the characters of the chief men
</p>
<p>in this superlative infamy of secession. We do not believe that the
</p>
<p>Southern people were privy to such crimes, or that all who became con-
</p>
<p> spicuous in the Southern councils and armies knew of such things, but
</p>
<p>that the real leaders were men steeped in crime, and capable of the ut
</p>
<p>most infamy, we have not a doubt. ' '
</p>
<p>Professor Robert Grant of Baltimore, Md., in his able and interesting
</p>
<p>letter written to the author prior to the Assassination of President Lin
</p>
<p>coln, and before his reelection, should be carefully read by every one.
</p>
<p>Then let him or her turn to the 120th page of the book commencing at
</p>
<p>the bottom, and they can see the country directed to the very spot where
</p>
<p>the scheme was being planned, and that was over six months before the
</p>
<p>plans were put into execution. We do not attain to the spirit or power
</p>
<p>of prophesy ; but we do believe we gave information which, if it had been

</p>
<p>properly heeded at the time, might have prevented the foul murder of
</p>
<p>President Lincoln. But fate had otherwise decreed, and all that is now
</p>
<p>left for us to do is to give a faithful and truthful history of the foul
</p>
<p>crime. After the battle of Gettysburg was fought, the leaders of the rebel-
</p>
<p>Uon for the first time discovered that all their previous calculations
</p>
<p>concerning the eastern troops were erroneous ; they then saw that the
</p>
<p>army of the Potomac, when properly handled, was more than a match for
</p>
<p>20
</p>
<p>306 ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>any similar number of troops they could bring into the field. They had
</p>
<p>not calculated on such bravery as was exhibited on McPherson' s Heights,
</p>
<p>and all over the battle ground. They now for the first time, contrary
</p>
<p>to their preconceived opinions, discovered that Americans are Ameri
</p>
<p>cans, whether born on the Penobscot, the Hudson, the Susquehanna, the
</p>
<p>Rio Grand, the Mississippi, or the James. All hope of gaining indepen
</p>
<p>dence by the valor of their arms was now gone. It was then determined
</p>
<p>at Richmond to assist the peace faction in the Free States to gain the
</p>
<p>presidential election coming on in the faU. But this move could not be
</p>
<p>expected to succeed without they had a war man to head the ticket. The
</p>
<p>plan was that a true and tried friend should occupy the second position,
</p>
<p>and by the popularity of the first, both were to be put into power.
</p>
<p>This accomplished, the next thing was to get rid of McClellan. He might
</p>
<p>quietly be sliped aside by poison, or if need be, publicly assassinated ;
</p>
<p>by this means they intended to get hold of the purse strings and sword
</p>
<p>of the Government. The right to secede would then be reassured, and
</p>
<p>by that means they would achieve their independence. But the first
</p>
<p>plan did not succeed ; yet over one million of dollars was taken from the
</p>
<p>rebel secret service fund and spent by the Richmond government in this
</p>
<p>enterprise. Lincoln being reellected, new tactics had to be resorted to.
</p>
<p>Their first plan had not succeeded, but they had another yet back as a
</p>
<p>substitute, and that was to papture if possible, and if that could not be
</p>
<p>done, then to assassinate the Chief Magistrate, Vice President, the best
</p>
<p>generals, and leading cabinet officers. It was thought that such an
</p>
<p>appalling catastrophe would be caclulated to intimidate the country to
</p>
<p>such a degree, those coming into place would readily consent to, and
</p>
<p>acknowledge their independence. Immediately after the result of the
</p>
<p>Presidential Election of 1864 was known (their first plot having failed) ,
</p>
<p>the follpwing advertisement appeared, first in the Dispatch, published at
</p>
<p>Salem Alabama, and afterwards in abeut all the rebel press of the South :
</p>
<p>"December!, 1864.
</p>
<p>" One Million Dollars wanted, to have Peace by the First of March.

</p>
<p>For to carry out his hellish plot, whieh never had an equal, some skiU-
</p>
<p>fuU bold and daring leader was required. He soon appeared. John W.
</p>
<p>Booth, a play actor by profession ; he was the idol of the play going
</p>
<p>people of aU the Southern Cities, where most of his professional life had
</p>
<p>been spent. The leaders of the rebellion well knew his impulsive na
</p>
<p>ture, they also knew he was a great admirer of " Brutus the Aassassin
</p>
<p>of Cassar," " Charlotte Corday the Assassin of Marat," " Joan of Arc"
</p>
<p>and that class of historical characters ; he was strongly in sympathy with
</p>
<p>the rebellion, and could rival Northern Copperhead newspapers or
</p>
<p>orators in vilifying President Lincoln. Booth was easily approached and
</p>
<p>they approached him. There is little doubt but Lewis Payne and John
</p>
<p>H. Surratt, also had access tc, and conferred with either Jeff Davis in
</p>
<p>person, or his agents in Canada. Beverley Tucker, George N. Sanders,
</p>
<p>C. C Clay, Jacob Thompson, W. N. Geary, and others.
</p>
<p>Mary E. Surratt, mother of John H. Surratt, whose house was made
</p>
<p>the rendezvous of all the assassins, was also active and energetic.
</p>
<p>George A. Atzeroth and David E. Harold also went into the conspiracy
</p>
<p>with spirit ; the former was to have assassinated Vice President John
</p>
<p>son, and had taken a room directly over his at the Kirkwood House
</p>
<p>where the Vice President boarded. Booth, Payne, John H. Surratt,

<p>Atzeroth, and Harold, were expected to do the work ; John H. Surratt
</p>
<p>was to have assassinated Lieutenant General Grant while at the theatre
</p>
<p>at the same time Booth did President Lincotn, but Grant's absence pre
</p>
<p>vented it. Booth performed his part ; Payne who had been assigned to
</p>
<p>assassinate Secretary Seward, made a bold and murderous attempt,
</p>
<p>severely wounding him, also his two sons, in the desperate onslaught.
</p>
<p>From some yet unknown cause, Atzeroth and Harold did not succeed,
</p>
<p>although the necessary preparation all had been made. Booth wanted
</p>
<p>the latter to kill the Vice President, although it had been previously
</p>
<p>agreed that Atzeroth should do it, but Booth feared he lacked courage.
</p>
<p>Harold was to have taken the life of Secretary Stanton ; but in his
</p>
<p>efforts to screw Atzeroth' s courage up to kiU the Vice President he failed
</p>
<p>to be on time to meet the Secretary of War, he having gone to see
</p>
<p>Mr. Seward, and had only left his bedside about twenty minutes be

<p>fore the assassin Payne made the murderous assault. Samuel Arnold,
</p>
<p>Michael O'Loughlin, and Samuel A. Mudd. The evidence against these
</p>
<p>persons was not sufficiently strong to cause their executicn, yet they were
</p>
<p>eneugh implicated to induce the court to sentence them to a life long im
</p>
<p>prisonment. Edward Spangler was sentenced for the term of six years.
</p>
<p>Immediately after the capture of Richmond and Lee's army by General
</p>
<p>Grant, the conspiracy was brought to a head. Therefore the first oppor
</p>
<p>tunity to put it into execution was to be embraced. The reader will re
</p>
<p>member it was on the 14th pf April, 1861, that the natienal flag was tow-
</p>
<p>308 ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>ered from the ramparts pf Fprt Sumter. On the 14th of April, just four
</p>
<p>years afterwards, the same banner, vindicated by a thousand bloody bat
</p>
<p>tles, was again thrown to the breeze by the same hand, and over the same
</p>
<p>spot whence it disappeared in 1861 . Richmond had been taken and Lee's
</p>
<p>army captured. Johnston was within the firm grasp of Sherman, and the
</p>
<p>14th of April 1865 was a day of rejoicing throughout the natien.
</p>
<p>Frpm East to West the flags were flying in honor of the great events.
</p>
<p>Monday night, April 17th, was designed as a night of illumination. But
</p>
<p>the foul assassins were urged to strike quick, or all would be lost. Mr.
</p>
<p>Lincoln was unusually cheerful at the prospect pf returning peace ; he
</p>
<p>had agreed to visit Ford's Theatre, and it was announced in the papers
</p>
<p>that he and General Grant would be at the theatre that evening. Mr.
</p>
<p>Lincoln in, company with his lady, Miss Harris, daughter of Senator Harris
</p>
<p>of New York, and Major Rathburn of the U. S. A., reached the theatre
</p>
<p>about twenty minutes before nine o'clock P.M. On entering the box
</p>
<p>the audience (which was immense, on account of the announcement in
</p>
<p>the papers that he and General Grant would attend the theatre that
</p>
<p>night) rose to their feet cheering and waving handkerchiefs and hats
</p>
<p>tumultuously. Mr. Lincoln's face was radiant with pleasure, indicating
</p>
<p>the gratitude that filled his heart, gracefully bowed in acknowledgement
</p>
<p>of the compliments that were being shown towards him. When a few
</p>
<p>minutes before, ten o'clpok in the evening, while the play, "Our Ameri
</p>
<p>can Ceusin" was prpgressing, Booth and two of his hired assassins ap
</p>
<p>peared in front of the theatre ; he had his horse secreted in an alley-way,
</p>
<p>and had made all things ready ; during the day he had the entrance to
</p>
<p>the box where the President was to sit so arranged it would be easy of
</p>
<p>access. It was about half past niae when Sergeant Joseph M. Dye (son
</p>
<p>of the author), Battery C. Pennsylvania Independent Artillery was stand
</p>
<p>ing in front of the entrance, he and Sergeant Cooper of the same battery
</p>
<p>saw Booth come out of the passage and join in conversation with two
</p>
<p>other persons. The President's carriage was standing near the curb
</p>
<p>stone on the street ; they observed an unusual excitement among them,
</p>
<p>and frequent references to the vehicle. At last, Booth went into the
</p>
<p>passage way that leads from the s age to the street. Ho soon re

<p>turned, and one of them called out the time, after some conversa
</p>
<p>tion, one stepped up the street, returning called out the time louder
</p>
<p>than before, "ten minutes past ten;" he that announced the time,
</p>
<p>now started up the street, and Booth went stra'ght into the theatre ;
</p>
<p>in a few moments after, persons ran out of the theatre, and an
</p>
<p>nounced the President was shot. Although nothing had taken place to
</p>
<p>cause the sergeant to know the business or intentions of the three men,
</p>
<p>yet his suspicions were aroused, but not sufficiently to warrant inter
</p>
<p>ference, or ask for an explanation. Knewing Bopth as an actor, it
</p>
<p>ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 309
</p>
<p>served to qu'.et, rather than to cause his excitabiUty concerning their
</p>
<p>intentions. But perhaps he was the only man living, out side of those
</p>
<p>engaged in the plot, that came near discovering, before the deed was done,
</p>
<p>Booth's intention to do it. But fate had otherwise decreed, and we
</p>
<p>must be content.
</p>
<p>Bppth passed- along the passage behind the spectators of the dress
</p>
<p>circle, showed a card to the President's messenger, and stood for a few
</p>
<p>moments looking down upon the stage and orchestra below. He then
</p>
<p>entered the vestibule of the President's box, closing the door behind
</p>
<p>him, fastening it by bracing a short plank against it from the wall so no
</p>
<p>one could open it from the outside, and drawing with hiB right hand
</p>
<p>a small silver mounted Derringer pistol from his inside coat pocket, held
</p>
<p>in his left hand a long double edged dagger. The President and all in
</p>
<p>the box were intent on looking at the play, Mr. Lincoln holding aside
</p>
<p>the curtain of the box with his left hand, leaning forward and lpoking
</p>
<p>with his head slightly turned towards the audience. Booth stepped into
</p>
<p>the inner door into the box directly behind the President, and holding
</p>
<p>his pistol just over the back of the chair in which he 6at, shot him
</p>
<p>through the back of the head. The President's head feU slightly for
</p>
<p>ward, his eyes closed, but otherwise his attitude every way remained the
</p>
<p>same. The report of the pistol startled those seated in the box. Major Rath-
</p>
<p>burn turning his eyes from the stage saw through the smoke which filled
</p>
<p>the box a man standing between him and the President. He instantly
</p>
<p>sprang forward to seize him ; Booth wrested himself from his grasp,
</p>
<p>dropped the pistol, striking at Rathburn with his dagger, stabbing him
</p>
<p>in the left arm near the shoulder. Booth then rushed to the front of the
</p>
<p>box, shouted, Sic Semper Tyrannis, placed his hand on the railing in
</p>
<p>front of the box and leaped over it down upon the stage. While
</p>
<p>jumping the spur on his heel caught in the flag that draped the front,
</p>
<p>causing him to fall, but recovering himself, rose, facing the audience in
</p>
<p>a theatrical attitude, brandishing the dagger, shouted, The South is
</p>
<p>Avenged ; rushing across the stage he made for the passage that led to
</p>
<p>the stage door in the rear of the theatre.
</p>
<p>An actor, named Hawk, was the only person on the stage when he

</p>
<p>leaped upon it ; seeing the dagger in Booth's hand he ran for his life off
</p>
<p>the stage and up a flight of stairs. Booth now made for the door that
</p>
<p>opened into the passage where his horse was standing ; closing the door
</p>
<p>behind him, mounted his horse that he had previously brought there,
</p>
<p>which was being held in readiness for him by a boy, rode off and over
</p>
<p>the east branch of the Potomac, crossing the Anacosta Bridge, giving
</p>
<p>his real name to the guard who challenged him, rode off among the rebel
</p>
<p>sympathizers in Lower Maryland and they secreted him for a time until he

</p>
<p>was shot in a barn in being captured, he refusing to surrender. Harold
</p>
<p>was with him at the time, but surrendered and was taken prisoner. Thus
</p>
<p>the life of the illustrious Chief Magistrate was taken, and in order that

<p>the reader may have a fuU and complete account of aU the facts in this
</p>
<p>terrible tragedy, and also to satisfy him of the complicity of leading
</p>
<p>rebels with the assassination of President Lincoln, we give the summing
</p>
<p>up of the facts and the evidence by John A. Bingham, special Judge Ad
</p>
<p>vocate, although lengthy, the reader if he ccmmences will finish.
</p>
<p>JUDGE-ADVOCATE BINGHAM'S GREAT PLEA.
</p>
<p>What is the evidence, direct and circumstantial ? That the accused, or either of
</p>
<p>them, together with John H. Surratt, John Wilkes Booth, Jefferson Davis, George
</p>
<p>N. Sanders, Beverly Tucker, Jacob Thompson, William C. Cleary, Clement C.
</p>
<p>Clay, George Harper and George YouDg, did combine, confederate and conspire in
</p>
<p>aid of the existing rebellion, as charged, to kill and murder, within the military
</p>
<p>department of Washington, and within the fortified and intrenched lines thereof
</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln, late, and at the time of the said combining, confederating and
</p>
<p>conspiring, President of the United States of America, and Commander-in-Chief
</p>
<p>of the army and navy thereof; Andrew Johnson, Vice-President of the United
</p>
<p>States ; WiUiam H. beward, Secretary of State of the United States, and Ulys
</p>
<p>ses S. Grant, Lieutenant-General of the armies thereof, and then in command,
</p>
<p>under the direction of the President.
</p>
<p>The time, as said in the charge and specification, when this conspiracy was en
</p>
<p>tered into, is immaterial, so that it appears by the evidence that the criminal com
</p>
<p>bination and agreement were formed before the commission of the acts alleged.
</p>
<p>That Jefferson Davis, one of the conspirators named, was the acknowledged chief
</p>
<p>and leader of the existing rebellion against the government of the United States, and
</p>
<p>that Jacob Thompson, George N. Sanders, Clement C. Clay, Beverly Tucker, and
</p>
<p>others named in the specification, were his duly accredited and authorized agents
</p>
<p>to act in the interests of said rebellion, are facts established by the testimony in
</p>
<p>this case beyond all question. That Davis, as the leader of said rebellion, gave to
</p>
<p>those agents, then in Canada, commissions in blank, bearing the official signature
</p>
<p>of the war minister, James A. Seddon, to be by them filled up and delivered to
</p>
<p>such agents as they might employ to act iu the interests of the rebellion within the
</p>
<p>United States, and intended to be a cover and protection for any ciinies they

</p>
<p>might therein commit in the service of the rebellion, are also facts established
</p>
<p>here, and which no man can gainsay. Who doubts that Kennedy, whose confes
</p>
<p>sion, made in view of immediate death as proved here, was commissioned by those
</p>
<p>accredited agents of Davis to burn the city of New York ? that he was to have at
</p>
<p>tempted it on the night of the Presidential election, and that he did, in combina
</p>
<p>tion with his confederates, set fire to four hotels in the city of New York on the
</p>
<p>night of the 25th of November last ? Who doubts that, in like manner in the in
</p>
<p>terests of the rebellion and by the authority of Davis, these his agents also com
</p>
<p>missioned Bennett H. Young to commit arson, robbery, and the murder of unarmed
</p>
<p>citizens in St. Albans, Vermont? Who doubts, upon the testimony shown, that
</p>
<p>Davis, by his agents, deliberately adopted the systam of starvation for the murder
</p>
<p>of our captive soldiers in his hands, or that, as shown by the testimony, he sanc
</p>
<p>tioned the burning of hospitals and steamboats, the property of private persons, and
</p>
<p>paid therefor from his stolen treasure the sum of thirty-five thousand dollars in
</p>
<p>gold? By the evidence of Joseph Hyams it is proved that Thompson  the agent of
</p>
<p>Jefforson Davis  paid him money for the service he rendered in the infamous and
</p>
<p>fiendish project of importing pestilence into our camps and cities to destroy the
</p>
<p>TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS. 311
</p>
<p>lives of citizens and soldiers alike, and into the house of the President, for the pur
</p>
<p>pose of destroying his life. It may bo said, and doubtless will be said, by tbe pen
</p>
<p>sioned advocates of this rebellion, that Hyams, being infamous is not to be believed.
</p>
<p>It is admitted that he is infamous, as it must be conceded that any man is infa
</p>
<p>mous who either participates in such a crime or attempts in any way to extenuate
</p>
<p>it. But it will be observed that Hyams is supported by the testimony of Mr. San
</p>
<p>ford Conover, who heard Blackburn and the other rebel agents in Canada speak of
</p>
<p>this infernal project, and by the testimony of Mr. Wall, the well-known auctioneer
</p>
<p>of this city, whose character is unquestioned, that he received this importation of
</p>
<p>pestilence (of course without any knowledge of the purposei, and that Hyams con
</p>
<p>signed the goods to him in the name of J. W. Harris  a fact in itself an acknow
</p>
<p>ledgment of guilt; and that he received afterwards a letter from Harris, dated To
</p>
<p>ronto, Canada West, December 1, 1864, wherein Harris stated that he had not
</p>
<p>been able to come to the States since his return to Canada, and asked for an ac
</p>
<p>count of the sale He identifies the Joseph Godfrey Hyams who testified in Court
</p>
<p>as the J. W. Harris who imported the pestilence. The very transaction shows
</p>
<p>that Hyams' statement is truthful. He gives the names of the parties connected
</p>
<p>with this infamy (Clement C. Clay, Dr. Blackburn, Rev. Dr. Stuart Robinson, J.
</p>
<p>C. Holcomb  all refugees from the Confederacy in Canada), and states that he
</p>
<p>gave Thompson a receipt for the fifty dollars paid to him, and that he was by oc
</p>
<p>cupation a shoemaker ; in none of which facts is there an attempt to discredit him.
</p>
<p>It is not probable that a man in his position in life would be able to buy five trunks
</p>
<p>of clothing, ship them all the way from Halifax to Washington, and then order
</p>
<p>them to be sold at auction, without regard to price, solely upon his own account. It
</p>
<p>is a matter of notoriety, that a part of his statement is verified by the results at
</p>
<p>Newborn, North Carolina, to which point, he says, a portion of the infected goods
</p>
<p>were shipped, through a sutler ,- tho result of which was, that nearly two thousand
</p>
<p>citizens and soldiers died there about that time with the yellow fever.
</p>
<p>That the rebel chief, Jefferson Davis, sanctioned these crimes, committed and
</p>
<p>attempted, through the instrumentality of his accredited agents in Canada, Thomp
</p>
<p>son, Clay, Tucker, Sanders, Cleary, &c, upon the persons aud property of the
</p>
<p>people of the North, there is positive proof on your record. The letter brought
</p>
<p>from Richmond, aud taken from the archives of lus late pretended government
</p>
<p>there, dated February II, 1865, and addressed to him by a late rebel senator from

<p>Texas, W. S. Oldham, contains the following significant words: "When Senator
</p>
<p>Johnson, of Missouri, and myself waited on you a few days since, in relation to the
</p>
<p>project of annoying and harrassing the enemy by means of burning their shipping,
</p>
<p>towns, &e , &c, there were several remarks made by you upon the subject, which 1
</p>
<p>was not fully prepared to answer, but which, upon subsequent conference with par
</p>
<p>ties proposing the enterprise, I find can not apply as objections to the scheme.
</p>
<p>First, the combustible materials consist of several preparations, and not one alone,
</p>
<p>and can be used without exposing the party using them to the least danger of detec
</p>
<p>tion whatever. .. . . . . . . . *.".'
</p>
<p>" Second, there is no necessity for sending persons in the military service into
</p>
<p>the enemy's country, but the work may be done by agents. ... I have seen
</p>
<p>enough of the effects that can be produced to satisfy me that in most cases, without
</p>
<p>any danger to the parties engaged, and in others but very slight, we can, first, burn
</p>
<p>every vessel that leaves a foreign port for the United States ; second, we can burn every
</p>
<p>transport that leaves the harbor of New York, or other Northern port, with supphes
</p>
<p>for the armies of the enemies in the South ; third, burn every transport and gun
</p>
<p>boat on the Mississippi river, as well as devastate the country of the enemy, and
</p>
<p>fill his people with terror and consternation. . . . For the purpose of satisfying
</p>
<p>your mind upon the subject, I respectfully but earnestly request that you will give
</p>
<p>an inta-view with General Harris, formerly a member of Congress from Missouri,
</p>
<p>who, I think, is able, from conclusive proofs, to convince you that what I have
</p>
<p>suggested is perfectly feasible and practicable."
</p>
<p>No one can doubt, from the tenor of this letter, that the rebel Davis only wanted
</p>
<p>to be satisfied that this system of arson and murder could be carried on by his
</p>
<p>312 TRIAL OF THE ASSASSINS.
</p>
<p>agents in the North successfully and without detection. With Mm it was not 8
</p>
<p>crime to do these acts, but only a crime to be detected in them. But Davis, by
</p>
<p>his endorsement on this letter, dated the 20th of February, 1865, bears witness to
</p>
<p>his own complicity and his own infamy in this proposed work of destruction and
</p>
<p>crime for the future, as well as to his complicity in what had before been attempted
</p>
<p>without complete success. Kennedy, with his confederates, had failed to burn the
</p>
<p>city of New York. " The combustibles " which Kennedy had employed were, it
</p>
<p>seems, defective. This was "a difficulty to be overcome." Neither had he been
</p>
<p>able to consummate tho dreadful work without subjecting himself to detection.
</p>
<p>This was another ' ' difficulty to be overcome. " Davis, on the 20th of February,
</p>
<p>1865, indorsed upon this letter these words : " Secretary of State, at his conven
</p>
<p>ience, see General Harris and learn what plan he has for ouercmning the difficulties
</p>
<p>heretofore experienced. J. D."
</p>
<p>This indorsement is unquestionably proved to bo the handwriting of Jefferson
</p>
<p>Davis, and it bears witness on its face that the monstrous proposition met his ap
</p>
<p>proval, and that he desired his rebel Secretary of State, Benjamin, to see General
</p>
<p>Harris, and learn how to overcome the difficulty heretofore experienced, to wit : the
</p>
<p>inefficiency of " the combustible materials " that had been employed, and the lia
</p>
<p>bility of his agents to detection. After this, who will doubt that he had endeav
</p>
<p>ored, by the hand of incendaries, to destroy by fire the property and lives of the
</p>
<p>people of the North, and thereby "fill them with terror and consternation ;" that
</p>
<p>he knew his agents had been unsuccessful ; that he knew his agents had been de
</p>
<p>tected in their villiany and punished for their crime ; that he desired through a
</p>
<p>more perfect ' ' chemical preparation, " by the science and skill of Professor McCul-
</p>
<p>loeh, to accomplish successfully what had been unsuccessfully attempted ?
</p>
<p>The intercepted letter of his agent,- Clement C. Clay, dated St. Catherine's, Can
</p>
<p>ada West, November 1, 1864, is an acknowledgment and confession of what they had
</p>
<p>attempted, and a suggestion made through J. P. Benjamin, rebel Secretary of
</p>
<p>State, of what remained to be done, in order to make the "chemical preparation "
</p>
<p>efficient. Speaking of this Bennett H. Young, he says : " You have doubtless
</p>
<p>learned through the press of tho United States of the raid on St. Albans by about
</p>
<p>twenty-five Confederate Soldiers, led by Lieutenant Bennett H. Young, of their
</p>
<p>attempt and failure to burn the town ; of their robbery of three banks there of the
</p>
<p>aggregate amount of about two hundred thousand dollars ; of their arrest in Can

</p>
<p>ada by the United States forces cf their commitment and the pending preliminary
</p>
<p>trial. "
</p>
<p>He makes application, in aid of Young and his associates, for additional docu
</p>
<p>ments, showing that they acted upon the authority of the Confederate States gov
</p>
<p>ernment, taking care to say, however, that he held such authority at the time, but
</p>
<p>that it ought to be more explicit, so far as regards the particular facts complained
</p>
<p>of. He states that he met Young at Halifax, in May, 1864, who developed his
</p>
<p>plans for retaliation on the enemy; that he, Clay, recommended him to the rebel
</p>
<p>Secretary of War ; that . after this, ' ' Young was sent back by the Secretary of
</p>
<p>War with a commission as Second Lieutenant, to execute his plans and purposes,
</p>
<p>but to report to lion. and myself." Young afterwards "proposed passing
</p>
<p>through New liugland, burning some towns and robbing them of whatever he
</p>
<p>could convert to the use of the confederate government. This I approved as
</p>
<p>justifiable retaliation. He attempted to burn the town of St. Albans, Vermont,
</p>
<p>and would have succeeded but for the failure of the chemical preparation, with
</p>
<p>Which he was armed. He then robbed the banks of funds amounting to over-
</p>
<p>two hundred thousand dollars. That he was not prompted by selfish or merce
</p>
<p>nary motives I am as well satisfied as I am that he is an honest man. He as
</p>
<p>sured me before going that his effort would be to destroy towns and farm-hpuses,
</p>
<p>hut not to plunder or rob ; but he said if, after firing' a town, he saw he could
</p>
<p>takej;ids from a bank or any house, and thereby might inflict injury upon the
</p>
<p>enemy and benefit his own government, he would do so. He added most em
</p>
<p>phatically that whatever he took should be turned over to the government, or
</p>
<p>ita representatives in foreign lands. My instructions to him were to destroy
</p>
<p>TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS. 313
</p>
<p>whatever was valuable, not to stop to rob : but if, after firing a town, he eould
</p>
<p>seize and carry off money, or treasury or bank notes, he miglit do so upon con
</p>
<p>dition that they were trblivered to the proper authorities of the confederate
</p>
<p>States," that is, to Clay himself.
</p>
<p>When he wrote this letter, it seems that this accredited agent of Jefferson Da
</p>
<p>vis was as slroilgly impressed with the usurpation and despotism of Mr. Lin
</p>
<p>coln's Administration as some of the advocates of his aiders and abettors seem
</p>
<p>to be at this day ; and he indulges in the following statement :  " All that a large
</p>
<p>portion of the Northern people, especially in the Northwest, want to resist the
</p>
<p>oppressions of the despotism at Washington is a leader. They are ripe for re
</p>
<p>sistance, and it may come soon after the Presidential election. At all events,
</p>
<p>it must come, if our armies are not overcome, or destroyed, or dispersed. No
</p>
<p>people of the Anglo-Saxon blood can long endure the usurpations and tyran
</p>
<p>nies of Lincoln." Clay does not sign the despatch, but indorses the hearer of
</p>
<p>it as a person who can identify him and give his name. The bearer of that let
</p>
<p>ter was the witness, Richard Montgomery, who saw Clay write a portion of the
</p>
<p>letter, and received it from his hand*, and subsequently delivered to the Assist
</p>
<p>ant Secretary of War of the United States, Mr. Daua. That the letter is in
</p>
<p>Clay's handwriting is clearly proved by those familiar with it. Mr. Montgom
</p>
<p>ery testifies that he was instructed by Clay to deliver this letter to BeDJamin,
</p>
<p>the rebel Secretary of State, if he could get through to Richmond, and to tell
</p>
<p>him what names to put in the blanks.
</p>
<p>This letter leaves no doubt, if any before existed, in the mind of any one who
</p>
<p>had read the letter of Oldham, and Davis' indorsement thereon, that the ' chem
</p>
<p>ical preparations" and " combustible miterials" had been tried and had failed,
</p>
<p>and it became a matter of great moment and concern that they should be so
</p>
<p>prepared as, in the words of Davis, "to overcome the difficulties heretofore ex
</p>
<p>perienced ;" that is to say, complete the work of destruction, and secure the
</p>
<p>perpetrators against personal injury or detection in the performance of it.
</p>
<p>It only remains to he seen whether Davis, the procurer of arson and of the
</p>
<p>indiscriminate murdar of the innocent and unoffending neee33irily resultant
</p>
<p>therefrom, wa.3 capable also of endeavoring to procure, and in fact did procure,
</p>
<p>the murder, by direct assassination, of the President of the United States, and
</p>
<p>others charged with the duty of maintaining the government of the United

<p>States, and of suppressing the rebellion in which this arch-traitor and conspira
</p>
<p>tor was engaged.
</p>
<p>The official papers of Davis, captured under the guns of our victorious army
</p>
<p>in his rebel capital, identified beyond question or shadow of doubt, and placed
</p>
<p>upon your record, together with tbe declarations and acts of his co-conspirators
</p>
<p>and agents, proclaim to all the world that he was capable of attempting to ac
</p>
<p>complish his treasonable procuration of the murder of the late President, and
</p>
<p>other chief officers of the United States, by the hands of hired assassins.
</p>
<p>In the fall of 1864, Lieutenant W. Alston addressed to " his Excellency" a
</p>
<p>letter now before the court, which contains the following words :
</p>
<p>" I now offer you my services, and if you will favor me in my designs, I will
</p>
<p>proceed, as soon as my health will permit, to rid my country of some of her
</p>
<p>deadliest enemie3, by striking at the very heart's blood of those who seek to
</p>
<p>enchain herin slavery. I consider nothing dishonorable having such a tenden
</p>
<p>cy. All I ask of you is, to fivor me by granting me the necessary papers, &c,
</p>
<p>to travel on I am perfectly familiar with the North, and feel confi
</p>
<p>dant that I can execute anything I undertake. I was in the raid last June in
</p>
<p>Kentucky, under General John H. Morgan : . . . was taken prisoner. . .
</p>
<p>. escaped from them by dressing myself in the garb of a citizen. ... I
</p>
<p>went through to the Canadas, from whence, by tbe assistance of Colonel J. P.
</p>
<p>Holcomb, I succeeded in working my way around and through the blockade. .
</p>
<p>. . I should like to have a personal interview with you in order to perfect
</p>
<p>the arrangements before starting,"
</p>
<p>Is there any room to doubt that this was a proposition to assassinate, by the
</p>
<p>hand of this man and his associates, such persons in the North as he deemed the
</p>
<p>314 TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS.
</p>
<p>"deadliest enemies" of the rebellion? The weakness of the man who, for a
</p>
<p>moment, can doubt that such was the proposition of .the writer of this letter, is
</p>
<p>certainly an object of commiseration. What had Jefferson Davis to say to this
</p>
<p>proposed assassination of the " deadliest enemies" in the North of his great
</p>
<p>treason 1 Did the atrocious suggestion kindle in him indignation agaiust the
</p>
<p>vUlain who offered, with his own hand, to strike the blow 1 Not at all. On the
</p>
<p>contrary, he ordered his private secretary, on the 29th of November. 1864, to
</p>
<p>indorse upon the letter these words :  "Lieutenant A. W. Alston, accompanied
</p>
<p>raid into Kentucky, and was captured ; hut escaped into Canada, from whence
</p>
<p>he found his way back. Now offers his services to rid the country of some of
</p>
<p>its deadliest enemies ; asks for papers, &c. Respectfully referred, by direction
</p>
<p>of the President, to the honorable Secretary of War." It is also indorsed, for
</p>
<p>attention, " By order." Signed " J. A. CampbeU, Assistant Secretary of War."
</p>
<p>Note the fact, in this connection, that Jefferson Davis himself, as well as his
</p>
<p>subordinate's, had, before the date of this indorsement, concluded that Abraham
</p>
<p>Lincoln was the " deadliest enemy" of the rebellion. You hear it in the rebel
</p>
<p>camp in Virginia, in 1863 ; declared by Booth, then and there present, and as
</p>
<p>sented to by rebel officers, that " Abraham Lincoln must be killed." You
</p>
<p>hear it in that slaughter-pen in Georgia, Andersonville, proclaimed among rebel
</p>
<p>officers, who, by the slow torture of starvation, inflicted cruel and untimely
</p>
<p>death on ten thousand of your defenders, captive3 in their hands whispering,
</p>
<p>like demons, their horrid purpose, " Abraham Lincoln must be killed." And in
</p>
<p>Canada, the accredited agents of Jefferson Davis, as early as October, 1864. and
</p>
<p>afterward, declared that " Abraham Lincoln must he killed," if his re-election
</p>
<p>could not be prevented. These agents in Canada, on the 13th of October, 1864,
</p>
<p>delivered, in cipher, to be transmitted to Richmond by Richard Montgomery,
</p>
<p>the witness whose reputation i-i unchallenged, the following communication :
</p>
<p>" October 13, 1864.  We again urge the immense necessity of our gaining
</p>
<p>immediate advantages. Strain every nerve for victory. We now look upon
</p>
<p>the rs-electien of Lincoln in November as almost certain, and we need to whip
</p>
<p>these hirelings to prevent it. Be3ides, with Lincoln re-elected, and his armies
</p>
<p>victorious, we need not hope even for recognition, much less the help mention
</p>
<p>ed in our last. Holcomh will explain this. Those figures of the Yankee army
</p>
<p>are correct to a unit. Our friends shall be immediately set to work as you

<p>direct." To which an official reply, in cipher, was delivered to Montgomery by an
</p>
<p>agent of the State Department in Richmond, dated October 19, 1834, as fol
</p>
<p>lows : 
</p>
<p>" Your letter of the 13th inst. is at hand. There is yet time enough to oolo-
</p>
<p>nize many voters before November. A blow will shortly be stricken here It
</p>
<p>is not quita time. General Longstreet is to attack Sheridan without delay, and
</p>
<p>then move North as far a3 practicable toward unprotected points. This will
</p>
<p>bo made instead of the movement before mentioned. He will endeavor to as
</p>
<p>sist tho Republicans in collecting their ballots. Be watchful and assist him."
</p>
<p>Ou the very day of the date of this Richmond despatch, Sheridan was at
</p>
<p>tacked and with what success history will declare. The court will not fail to
</p>
<p>notice that the re-election of Mr. Lincoln is to be prevented, if possible, by any
</p>
<p>and every moans. Nor will they fail to notice that Holcomb is to " explain
</p>
<p>this"  the same person who, in Canada, was the friend and adviser of Alston,
</p>
<p>who proposed to Davis the assassination of the " deadliest enemies" of the re
</p>
<p>bellion. In the despatch of the 13th of October, which was borne by Montgomery, and
</p>
<p>transmitted to Richmond in October last, you will find these words :  " Our
</p>
<p>friends shall be immediately set to work as you direct," Mr. Lincoln is tbe
</p>
<p>subject of that despatch. Davis is therein notified that his agents in Canada
</p>
<p>look upon the re-election of Mr. Lincoln in November as almost certain. In
</p>
<p>this connection he is assured by those agents that the friends of their cause are
</p>
<p>to be set to work as Davis had directed.
</p>
<p>The conversations which are proved by witnesses, whose character stands un-
</p>
<p>TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS. 315
</p>
<p>impeached, disclose what '-'work" the "friends" were to do under the direction
</p>
<p>of Davis himself. Who were these " friends, "and what was ' ' the work " which
</p>
<p>his agents, Thompson, Clay, Tucker, and Saunders, had been directed to set
</p>
<p>them at? Let Thompson answer for himself. In a conversation with Richard
</p>
<p>Montgomery, in the summer of 1864, Thompson said " he had his friends, con
</p>
<p>federates, all over the Northern States, who were ready and willing to go any
</p>
<p>length for the good of the cause of the South, and he could at any time have
</p>
<p>the tyrant Lincoln, or any other of his advisers that he chose, put out of bis
</p>
<p>way ; that they would not consider it a crime when done for the cause of the
</p>
<p>confederacy." This conversation was repeated by the witness in the summer
</p>
<p>of 1864 to Clement C. Clay, who immediately stated : " That is so ; we are all
</p>
<p>devoted to our cause, and ready to go any length  to do anything under the
</p>
<p>sun." At and about the time that these declarations of Clay and Thompson were
</p>
<p>made, Alston, who made the proposition, as we have seen, to Davis, to be fur
</p>
<p>nished with papers, to go North and rid the confederacy of some of it3 ' deadli
</p>
<p>est enemies/' was in Canada. He was, doubtless, one of the " friends" referred
</p>
<p>to. As appears from the testimony of Montgomery, Payne, the prisoner at
</p>
<p>your bar, was about that time in Canada, and was seen standing by Thompson's
</p>
<p>door, engaged in a conversation with Clay, between whom and the witness some
</p>
<p>words were interchanged, when Clay stated he (Payne) was one of their friends,
</p>
<p>" we trust him." It is proved beyond a shadow of doubt, that in October last,
</p>
<p>John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of the President, was also in Canada and upon
</p>
<p>intimate term3 with Thompson, Clay, Sanders, and other rebel agents. Who
</p>
<p>can doubt, in the light of the events which have since transpired, that he wa3
</p>
<p>one of the "friends" to be "set to work" as Davis had already directed ; not,
</p>
<p>perhaps, as yet to asassinate the President, but to do that other work which is
</p>
<p>suggested in the letter of Oldham, indorsed by Davis in his own hr.nd, aud
</p>
<p>spread upon your record, the work of the secret incendiary, which was to " fill
</p>
<p>the people of the North with terror and consternation."
</p>
<p>The other " work" spoken of by Thompson, putting the tyrant Lincoln and any
</p>
<p>of his advisers out of the way, was work doubtless to be commenced only after the
</p>
<p>re-election of Mr. Lincoln, which they had already declared in their despatch
</p>
<p>to their employer, Davis, was with them a foregone conclusion. At all events,
</p>
<p>it was not until after the Presidential election in November that Alston pro

</p>
<p>posed to Davis to go North on the work of assassination ; nor was it until after
</p>
<p>that election that Booth was found in possession of the letter which is m evi
</p>
<p>dence, and which discloses the purpose to assassinate the President. Being as
</p>
<p>sured, however, when Booth was with them in Canada, as tney had already de
</p>
<p>clared, in their despatch, that the re-election of Mr. Lincoln was certain, in
</p>
<p>which event there would be no hope for the confederacy, they doubtless en
</p>
<p>tered into the arrangement with Booth as one of their "friends." that as soon as
</p>
<p>that fact was determined he should go "to work," and as soon as might be
</p>
<p>' rid the confederacy of the tyrant Lincoln and of his advisers."
</p>
<p>That these persons named upon your record, Thompson, Sanders, Clay,
</p>
<p>Cleary and Tucker, were the agents of Jefferson Davis, is another fact estab
</p>
<p>lished in this case beyond a doubt. They made affidavit of it themselves, of
</p>
<p>record here, upon the examination of their " friends." charged with the raid
</p>
<p>upon St. Albans, before Judge Smith, in Canada. It is in evidence also by the
</p>
<p>letter of Clay, before referred to.
</p>
<p>The testimony, to which I have thus briefly referred, shows, by the letter of
</p>
<p>his agents, of the 13th of October, that Davis had before directed those agents
</p>
<p>to set his friends at work. By the letter of Clay, it seems that his direction h?d
</p>
<p>been obeyed, and his friends bad been set to work, in the burning and robb ry
</p>
<p>and murder at St Alban?, in the attempt to burn the city of New York, and in the
</p>
<p>attempt to introduce pestilence into this Capital and into frhe house of the Presi
</p>
<p>dent. It having appeared, by the letter of Alston, and the indorsement there
</p>
<p>on, that Davis bad in November entertained the proposition of sending agents,
</p>
<p>that is to say, "friends," to the North, to not only "spread terror and conster-

</p>
<p>nation among the people," by means of his " chemical preparations," bnt also,
</p>
<p>in the words of that letter, "to strike," bythehand9 ot assassins, '' at the heart's
</p>
<p>blood" of the deadliest enemies in the North tp the confederacy of traitors ; it
</p>
<p>has also appeared by the testimony of many respectable witnesses, among oth
</p>
<p>ers the attorneys who represented the people of the United States and the State
</p>
<p>of Vermont, in the preliminary trial of the raiders in Canada, that Clay, Thomp
</p>
<p>son, Tucker, Sanders, and Gleary, declared themselves the agent3 of the con
</p>
<p>federacy. It also clearly appears by the correspondence referred to and the
</p>
<p>letter of Clay, that they were holding and at any time able to command blank
</p>
<p>commissions from Jefferson Davis to authorize their friends to do whatever work
</p>
<p>they appointed them to do, in the interest of the rebellion, by the destruction
</p>
<p>of life and property in the North.
</p>
<p>If a prima facie case justifies, as we have seen by the law of evidence it does,
</p>
<p>the introduction of all declarations and acts of any of the parties to a conspira
</p>
<p>cy, uttered and done in the prosecution of the common design, as evidence
</p>
<p>against all the rest, it results, that whatever was said or done in furtherance of
</p>
<p>the common design, after this month of October, 1864, by either of these agents
</p>
<p>in Canada, is evidence not only against themselves, but against Davis as well,
</p>
<p>of his complicity with them in the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Mr. Montgomery testifies that he met Jacob Thompson in January, at Mon
</p>
<p>treal, when he said that " a proposition had been made to him to rid the world
</p>
<p>of the tyrants, Lincoln, Stanton, Grant, and some others : tbat he knew the men
</p>
<p>who had made the proposition were bold, daring men, able to execute what
</p>
<p>they undertook ; that he himself was in favor of the proposition, but had deter
</p>
<p>mined to defer his answer until he had consulted his government at Richmond ;
</p>
<p>that he was then only awaiting their approval." This was about the middle of
</p>
<p>January, and, consequently, more tiian a month after Alston had made his
</p>
<p>proposition direct to Davis, in writing, to go North and rid their confederacy
</p>
<p>of some of its " deadliest enemies." It was at the time of this conversation that
</p>
<p>Payne, the prisoner, was seen by the witness standing at Thompson's door in
</p>
<p>conversatioii wiih Clay. This witness also shows the intimacy between Thomp
</p>
<p>son, Clay, Cleary, Tucker, and Sanders.
</p>
<p>A few days after the assassination of the President, Beverly Tucker said to this
</p>
<p>witness ' ' that President Lincoln deserved his death long ago ; that it was a pity he

</p>
<p>di'ln't have it long ago; and it was too bad that the boys had not been allowed to
</p>
<p>act when they wanted to. "
</p>
<p>This remark undoubtedly had reference to the propositions made in the fall to
</p>
<p>Thompson, and also to Davis, to rid the South of its deadliest enemies by their as
</p>
<p>sassination. Cleary, who was accredited by Thompson as his confidential agent,
</p>
<p>also stated to this witness that Booth was one of the party to whom Thompson had
</p>
<p>referred in the conversation in January, in which he said he knew the men who
</p>
<p>were ready to rid the world of the tyrant Lincoln, and of Stanton and Grant.
</p>
<p>Cleary also said, speaking of the assassination, "that it was a pity that, the whole
</p>
<p>work had not been done," and added, "they had better look out, we are not done
</p>
<p>yet ;" manifestly referring to the statement made by his employer, Thompson, be
</p>
<p>fore in the summer, that not only the tyrant Lincoln, but Stanton and Grant, and
</p>
<p>others of his advisers, should he put out of the way. Cleary also stated to this
</p>
<p>witness that Booth had visited Thompson twice in tbe winter, the last time in De
</p>
<p>cember, and had also been there in the summer.
</p>
<p>Sanford Conover testified that he had been for some time a clerk iu the
</p>
<p>War Department, in Richmond, that in Canada ho knew Thompson, Sanders,
</p>
<p>Cleary Tucker, Clay and other rebel agents; that he knew John H. Surratt
</p>
<p>and John Wilkes Booth ; that he saw Booth there upon one occasion, and Surratt
</p>
<p>upon several successive days; that he saw Surratt (whom he describes) in April
</p>
<p>last, in Thompson's room, and also in company with Sanders ; that about the
</p>
<p>Cth or 7th of April last Surratt delivered to Jacob Thompson a despatch brought
</p>
<p>by him from Benjamin, at Richmond, inclosing one in cipher from Davis. Thomp
</p>
<p>son had before this proposed to Conover to engage in a plot to assassinate Presi-
</p>
<p>TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS. 317
</p>
<p>dent Lincoln and his Cabinet, and on this occasion he laid his hand upon these des
</p>
<p>patches and said, "This makes the thing all right," referring to the assent of the
</p>
<p>rebel authorities, and stated that the rebel authorities had consented to the plot to
</p>
<p>assassinate Lincoln, Johnston, tho Secretary of War, Secretary of State, Judge Chase
</p>
<p>and General Grant, Thompson remarked further that the assassination of these
</p>
<p>parties would leave the government of tbe United States entirely without a head ;
</p>
<p>that there was no provision in the Constitution of the United States by which they
</p>
<p>could elect another President, if these men were put out of the way.
</p>
<p>In speaking of this assassination of the President and others, Thompson said that
</p>
<p>it was only removing them from office ; that the killing of a tyrant was no murder.
</p>
<p>It seems that he had learned precisely the same lesson that Alston had learned in
</p>
<p>November, when he communicated with Davis, and said, speaking of the President's
</p>
<p>assassination, "ho did not think anything dishonorable that would serve their
</p>
<p>cause.'' Thompson stated at" the same time that he had conferred a commission
</p>
<p>on Booth, and that everybody engaged in the enterprise would be commissioned,
</p>
<p>and if it succeeded, or failed, and they escaped into Canada, they could not be re
</p>
<p>claimed under the extradition treaty. The fact that Thompson and other rebel
</p>
<p>agents held blank commissions, as I have said, has been proved, and a copy of one
</p>
<p>of them is on record here.
</p>
<p>This witness also testifies to a conversation with William C. Cleary, shortly af
</p>
<p>ter the surrender of Lee's army, and on the day before the President's assassina
</p>
<p>tion, at the St. Lawrence Hotel, Aiontreal, when speaking of the rejoicing in the
</p>
<p>States over the capture of Richmond, Cleary said, "they would put the laugh on
</p>
<p>the other side of their mouth in a day or two." These parties knew that Conover
</p>
<p>was in the secret of the assassination, and talked with him about it as freely as
</p>
<p>they would speak of the weather. Before the assassination he had a conversation
</p>
<p>also with Sanders, who asked him if he knew Booth well, and expressed some ap
</p>
<p>prehension that Booth would "make a failure of it; that he was desperate and
</p>
<p>reckless, and he was afraid the whole thing would prove a failure."
</p>
<p>Dr. James D. Merritt testifies that George Young, one of the parties named in
</p>
<p>the record, declared in his presence, in Canada, last fall, that Lincoln should
</p>
<p>never be inaugurated ; that they had friends in Washington, who, I suppose, were
</p>
<p>some of the same friends referred to in the despatch of October 14, and which Da
</p>
<p>vis had directed them "to set to work." George N. Sanders also said to him

</p>
<p>" that Lincoln would keep himself mighty close if he did servo another term ; '
</p>
<p>while Steele and other confederates declared that the tyrant never should servo an
</p>
<p>other term. He heard the assassination discussed at a meeting of these rebel
</p>
<p>agents in Montreal in February last. "Sanders said they had plenty of money to
</p>
<p>accomplish the assassination, and named a number of persons who wore ready and
</p>
<p>willing to engage in undertaking to remove the President, Vice President, the
</p>
<p>Cabinet, and some of the leading Generals. At this meeting he read a letter
</p>
<p>which he had received from Davis, which justified him in making any arrange
</p>
<p>ments that he could to accomplish the object. This letter the witness heard read,
</p>
<p>and it, in substance declared that if the people in Canada and the Southerners in
</p>
<p>the States were willing to submit to be governed by such a, tyrant as Lincoln, he
</p>
<p>did not wish to recognize them as friends. The letter was read openly ; it was
</p>
<p>also handed to Colonel Steele, George Young, Hill and Scott to read. This was
</p>
<p>about the middle of February last. At this meeting Sanders named over the per
</p>
<p>sons who were willing to accomplish the assassination, and among the persons
</p>
<p>thus named was Booth, whom the witness had seen in Canada in October, also
</p>
<p>George Harper, One of the conspirators named on the record, Caldwell, Randall,
</p>
<p>Harrison and Surratt.
</p>
<p>The witness understood, from the reading of the letter, that if the President,
</p>
<p>Vice-President, and Cabinet could be disposed of, it would satisfy the people of the
</p>
<p>North that the Southerners had friends in the North ; that a peace could be ob
</p>
<p>tained on better terms ; that the rebels had endeavored to bring about a war be
</p>
<p>tween the United States and England, and that Mr. Seward, through his energy
</p>
<p>and sagacity, had thwarted all then efforts ; that was given as a reason for remov-
</p>
<p>318 TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS.
</p>
<p>ing him. On the 5th or 6th of April last, this witness, met George Harper, Cald
</p>
<p>well, Randall, and others, who are spoken of in this meeting at Montreal as en
</p>
<p>gaged to assassinate the President and Cabinet, when Harper said they were going
</p>
<p>to the States to make a row such as had never been heard bf, and added that "if
</p>
<p>I (the witness) did not hear of the death of Old Abe, of the Vice-President, and of
</p>
<p>Gen. Dix, in less than ten days, I might put him down as a fool. That was on
</p>
<p>the 6th of April. lie mentioned that Booth was in Washington at that time. He
</p>
<p>said they had plenty of friends in Washington, and that some fi.teen or twenty
</p>
<p>were going."
</p>
<p>This witness ascertained on the 8th of April that Harper and others had left for
</p>
<p>the States. The proof is that these parties could come through to Washington from
</p>
<p>Montreal or Toronto in thirty-six hours. They did come, and within the ten days
</p>
<p>named by Harper the President was murdered. Sonie attempts have been made
</p>
<p>to discredit this witness (Dr. Mott), not by the examination of witnesses in conrt,
</p>
<p>not by any apparent want of truth in the testimony, but by the ex parte statements
</p>
<p>of these rebel agents in Canada and their hired advocates in the United States.
</p>
<p>There is a statement upon record, verified by an official communication from the
</p>
<p>War Department, which shows the truthfulness ot this witness, and that is, that
</p>
<p>before the assassination, learning that Harper and his associates had started for the
</p>
<p>States, informed as he was of their purpose to assassinate the President, Cabinet and
</p>
<p>leading Generals, Merritt deemed it his duty to call, and did call, on the 10th
</p>
<p>of April, upon a justice of the peace in Canada, named Davidson, and gave him
</p>
<p>the information that he might take steps to stop these proceedings. The corres
</p>
<p>pondence on this subject with Davidson has been brought into court. Dr. Merritt
</p>
<p>testifies, farther, that after this meeting in Montreal he had a conversation with
</p>
<p>Clement C. Clay, in Toronto, about the letter from Jefferson Davis, which San
</p>
<p>ders had exhibited, in which conversation Clay gave the witness to understand that
</p>
<p>he knew the nature of the letter perfectly, and remarked that he thought tho end
</p>
<p>would justify the means." The witness also testifies to the preseuee of Booth with
</p>
<p>Sanders in Montreal last fall, and of Surratt in Toronto in February last.
</p>
<p>The court must be satisfied, by the manner of this and other witnesses to tie
</p>
<p>transactions in Canada, as well as by the fact that they are wholly uncontra licted
</p>
<p>in any material matter that they state, that they speak the truth, and that the sev
</p>
<p>eral parties named on your record  Davis, Thompson, Cleary, Tucker, Clay,

<p>Young, Harper, Booth and John H. Surratt  did combine and conspire together
</p>
<p>in Canada to kill and murder Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, William H.
</p>
<p>Seward and Ulysses S. Grant. That this agreement was substantially entered into
</p>
<p>by Booth and the agents of Davis in Canada as early as October, there can not be
</p>
<p>any doubt. The language of Thompson at that time and before was that he was in
</p>
<p>favor of the assassination. His further language was, that he knew the men who
</p>
<p>were ready to do it, and Booth, it is shown, was there at that time, and, as Thomp
</p>
<p>son's Secretary says, was one of the men referred to by Thompson.
</p>
<p>Tho fact that others, besides the parties named on the record, were, by the
</p>
<p>terms of the conspiracy, to be assassinated, in nowise affects the case now on trial.
</p>
<p>If it is true that these parties did conspire to murder other parties as well as those
</p>
<p>named upon the record, the substance of the charge is proved.
</p>
<p>It is also true that if, in pursuance of that conspiracy, Booth, confederated with
</p>
<p>Surratt and the accused, killed and murdered Abraham Lincoln, the charge and
</p>
<p>specification is proved literally as stated on your record, although their conspiracy
</p>
<p>embraced other persons. In law the case stands, though it may appear that the
</p>
<p>conspiracy was to kill and murder the parties named in the record, and others not
</p>
<p>named in the record. If the proof is that the accused, with Booth, Surratt, Davis,
</p>
<p>&c., conspired to kill and murder one or moro of the persons named, the charge of
</p>
<p>conspiracy is proved.
</p>
<p>The declaration of Sanders, as proved, that there was plenty of money to carry
</p>
<p>out this assassination, is very strongly corroborated by tho testimony of Mr. Camp
</p>
<p>bell, cashier of the Ontario Bank, who stated that Thompson, during the current
</p>
<p>year preceding the assassination, had upon deposit in the Montieal branch of the
</p>
<p>TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS. 319
</p>
<p>Ontario Bank, six hundred and forty-nine thousand dollars, besides large sums to
</p>
<p>his credit in other banks in the Province.
</p>
<p>There is a further corroboration of the testimony of Conover as to the meeting of
</p>
<p>Thompson and Surratt in Montreal, and the delivery of the despatches from Rich
</p>
<p>mond, on the 6th or 7th of April, first, in the fact which is shown, by the testi
</p>
<p>mony of Chester, that in the winter or spring Booth said he himself or some
</p>
<p>other party must go to Richmond ; and, second by the letter of Arnold, dated 27th
</p>
<p>March last, that he preferred Booth's first quety, that he would first go to Rich
</p>
<p>mond and see how they would take it, manifestly alluding to the proposed assassin
</p>
<p>ation of the President.
</p>
<p>It does not follow because Davis had written a letter in February which, in sub
</p>
<p>stance, approved the general object that the parties were fully satisfied with it, be
</p>
<p>cause it is clear there was to be some arrangement made about the funds, and it is
</p>
<p>also clear that Davis had not before as distinctly approved and sanctioned this act
</p>
<p>as his agents either in Canada or here desired. Booth said to Chester, " We
</p>
<p>must have money, there is money in this business, and if you will enter into it 1
</p>
<p>will place three thousand dollars at the disposal of your family, but I have no
</p>
<p>money myself, and must go to Richmond, " or one of the parties must go, ' ' to get
</p>
<p>money to carry out the enterprise." This was one of the arrangements that was
</p>
<p>to be "made right in Canada." The funds at Thompson's disposal, as the
</p>
<p>banker testifies, were exclusively raised by drafts of the Secretary of the Treasury
</p>
<p>of the confederate States upon London, deposited in their bank to the credit of
</p>
<p>Thompson. Accordingly, about the 27th of March, Surratt did go to Richmond. On the 3d
</p>
<p>of April he returned to Washington, and the same day left for Canada. Before
</p>
<p>leaving he stated to Weichman that when in Richmond he had a conversation
</p>
<p>with Davis and with Benjamin. The fact in this connection is not to be over
</p>
<p>looked, that on or about tho day Surratt arrived in Montreal, April 6, Jacob Thomp
</p>
<p>son, as the cashier of the Ontario Bank states, drew of these Confederate funds
</p>
<p>the sum of one hundred and eighty thousand dollars in the form of certificates,
</p>
<p>which as the bank officer testifies, "might be used anywhere."
</p>
<p>What more is wanting ? Surely no word further need be spoken to show that
</p>
<p>John Wilkes Booth was in this conspiracy ; that John H. Surratt was in this con
</p>
<p>spiracy ; and that Jefferson Davis and his several agents named in Canada, were
</p>
<p>in this conspiracy. If any additional evidence is wanting to show the complicity

<p>of Davis in it, let the paper found in tho possession of his hired assassin Booth
</p>
<p>come to bear witness against him. That paper contained the secret cipher which
</p>
<p>Davis used in his State Department in Richmond, which he employed iu commun
</p>
<p>icating with his agents in Canada, and which they employed in the letter of Octo
</p>
<p>ber 13, notifying him that "their friends would be set to work as he had directed."
</p>
<p>The letter in cipher found in Booth's possession is translated here by. the use of
</p>
<p>the cipher machine now in court, which, as the testimony of Mr. Dana shows, he
</p>
<p>brought from the rooms of Davis' State Department in Richmond. Who gave
</p>
<p>Booth this secret cipher ? Of what use was it to him if he was not in confedera
</p>
<p>tion with Davis ?
</p>
<p>But there is one other item of testimony that ought, among honest and intelli
</p>
<p>gent people at all conversant with this evidence, to end all further inquiry as to
</p>
<p>whether Jefferson Davis was one of the parties with Booth, as charged upon this
</p>
<p>record, in the conspiracy to assassinate the President and others. That is, that on
</p>
<p>the fifth day after the assassination, in the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, a
</p>
<p>telegraphic despatch was received by him, at the house of Mr. Bates, from John
</p>
<p>C. Breckinridge, his rebel Secretary of War, which dispatch 'is produced here,
</p>
<p>identified by the telegraph agent, and placed Upon your record in the words fol
</p>
<p>lowing :
</p>
<p>" Greensboro', April 19, 1865. His Excellency President Davis :  President
</p>
<p>Lincoln was assassinated in the theatre at Washington on the night of tho 14th
</p>
<p>inst. beward's house was entered on the same night, and he was repeatedly
</p>
<p>stabbed, and is probabl) mortally wounded. John C. Breciunridge."
</p>
<p>320 TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS.
</p>
<p>At the time this despatch was handed to him, Davis was addressing a meeting
</p>
<p>from the steps of Mr. Bates' house, and after reading the despatch to the people,
</p>
<p>he said :  "If it were to be done, it were better it were well done." Shortly af
</p>
<p>terward, in the house of tho witness, in the same city, Breckinridge, having come
</p>
<p>to see Davis, stated his regret that the occurrence had happened, because he deem
</p>
<p>ed it unfortunate tor the people of the South at that time. Davis replied, referring
</p>
<p>to the assassination, ' ' Well, General, I don't know ; if it were to be done at all,
</p>
<p>it vvere belter that it were well done ; and if the same had been done to Andy
</p>
<p>Johnson, tho beast, and Secretary Stanton, the job would then be complete."
</p>
<p>Accomplished as this man was in all the arts of a conspirator, he was not equal
</p>
<p>to the task  as, happily in the good providence of God, no mortal man is  of con
</p>
<p>cealing, by any form of words, any great crime which he may have meditated or
</p>
<p>perpetrated either against his government or his tellow-man. It was doubtless
</p>
<p>furthest' from Jefferson Davis' purpose to make confession, and yet he did make
</p>
<p>confession. His guilt demanded utterance; that demand he could not resist:
</p>
<p>therefore his words proclaimed his guilt, in spite of his purpose to conceal it. He
</p>
<p>said, " if it were to be done, it were better it were well done." Would any man
</p>
<p>ignorant of the conspiracy bo able to devise and fashion such a form of speech as
</p>
<p>that ? Had not the President been murdered ? Had he not reason to believe that
</p>
<p>tho Secretary of State had been mortally wounded ! Yet he was not satisfied but
</p>
<p>was compelled to say, " it were better it were well done;" that is to say, all that
</p>
<p>had been agreed to be done had not been done.
</p>
<p>Two clays afterwards, in his conversation with Breckinridge, he not only repeats
</p>
<p>the same form of expression, " If it wore to be done it were better it were well
</p>
<p>done," but adds these words :  " And if the same had been dons to Andy John
</p>
<p>son, the beast, and to Secretary Stanton, the job would then be complete." He
</p>
<p>would accept the assassination of' the President, the Vice President, of the Secretary
</p>
<p>of State, and the Secretary of War as a complete execution of the "job, " which he
</p>
<p>had given out upon contract, and which he had "made all right," so far as the pay
</p>
<p>was concerned, by the despatches he had sent to Thompson by Surratt, ous of his
</p>
<p>hired assassins.
</p>
<p>Whatever may be the convictions of others, my own conviction is that Jefferson
</p>
<p>Davis is as clearly proven guilty of this conspiracy as is John Wilke3 Booth, by
</p>
<p>whose hand Jefferson Davis infiicted the mortal wound upon Abraham Lincoln.

<p>His words of intense hate, and rage, and disappointment are not to bo overlooked
</p>
<p> that the assassins had not done their work weU; that they had not succeeded in
</p>
<p>robbing the people altogether of their constitutional Executive and his advisers,
</p>
<p>and hence he exclaims, "if they had killed Andy Johnson the beast!" Neither
</p>
<p>can he conceal his chagrin and disappointment that the war minister of the repub
</p>
<p>lic, whose energy, incorruptible integrity, sleepless vigilence, and executive ability
</p>
<p>had organized day by day, month by month, and year by year, victory for our
</p>
<p>arms, had escaped the knife of the hired assassins. The job, says this pro
</p>
<p>curer of assassination, was not well done ; it had been better if it had been well
</p>
<p>done! Because Abraham Lincoln had been clear in his great office, and had saved
</p>
<p>the nation's life by enforcing the nation's laws this traitor declares he must be mur
</p>
<p>dered; because Mr. Seward, as the foreign Secretary of the country, had thwarted
</p>
<p>the purposes of treason to plunge his country into war with England, he must be
</p>
<p>murdered ; bocause, upon tho murder of Mr. Lincoln, Andrew Johnson would
</p>
<p>succeed the Presidency, and bocause he had been true to the Constitution and
</p>
<p>Government, faithful found among tho faithless of his own State, clinging to tho
</p>
<p>falling pillars of the Republic when others had fled, ho must bs murdered ; and be
</p>
<p>cause the Secretary of War had taken care, by the faithful discharge of his duties,
</p>
<p>that tho Republic should live and not die, he must be murdered. Inasmuch as
</p>
<p>these two faithful offijers were not also assassinated, assuming that tho Secretary of
</p>
<p>State was mortally wounded, Davis could not conceal his disappointment and cha
</p>
<p>grin that the work was not "well done ; " that " the job was not complete."
</p>
<p>Thus it appears by the testimony, that tho proposition mads to Davis was to
</p>
<p>kill and murder the deadliest enemies of the Confederacy  not to kidnap them, as
</p>
<p>TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS. 321
</p>
<p>is now pretended here : that by the declaration of Sanders, Tucker, Thompson,
</p>
<p>Clay, Cleary, Harper and Young, tho conspirators in Canada, the agreement and
</p>
<p>combination among them was to kill and murder Abraham Lincoln, Wm. H.
</p>
<p>Seward, Andrew Johnson, Ulysses s. Grant, Edwin M. Stanton, and others of his
</p>
<p>advisers, and not to kidnap them ; it appears from every utterance of John Wilkes
</p>
<p>Booth, as well as from the Charles Selby letter, of which mention will presently be
</p>
<p>made, that, as early as November, the proposition with him was to kill and mur
</p>
<p>der, not to kidnap.
</p>
<p>Since the first examination of Conover, who testified, as the court will remem
</p>
<p>ber, to many important facts against thess conspirators and agents of Davis in Can
</p>
<p>ada, among others, tho terrible and fiendish plot disclosed by Thompson, Pallen
</p>
<p>and others, that they had ascertained the volume of water in the reservoir supply
</p>
<p>ing New York city, estimated tho quantity of poison required to render it deadly,
</p>
<p>and intended thus to poison a whole city. Conover returned to Canada, by direc
</p>
<p>tion of this court, for the purpose of obtaining certain documentary evidence.
</p>
<p>There, about tho 9 th of Juno, ho met Beverly Tucker, Sanders and other conspir
</p>
<p>ators, and conversed with them. Tucker declared that ..-ecretary Stanton, whom
</p>
<p>ho denounced as " a scoundrel," and Judge Holt, whom he called "a bloodthirsty
</p>
<p>villain, " "could protect themselves as long as they remained in office by a guard,
</p>
<p>but that would not always be tho case, and, by the Eternal, ho had a large account
</p>
<p>to settle with them. "
</p>
<p>After this, the evidence of Conover hero having been published, these parties
</p>
<p>called upon him and asked him whether he had been to Washington, and had tes
</p>
<p>tified before this court. Conover denied it; they insisted, and took him to a room,
</p>
<p>where, with drawn pistols, they compelled him to consent to make an affidavit
</p>
<p>that he had been falsely personated here by another, and that he would make that
</p>
<p>affidavit before a Mr. Kerr, who would witness it. They then called in Mr. Ken-
</p>
<p>to certify to the public that Conover had made such a denial. They also compell
</p>
<p>ed this witness to furnish for publication an advertisement offering a reward of five
</p>
<p>hundred dollars for the arrest of tho "infamous and perjured scoundrel" who had
</p>
<p>recently personated James W. Wallace under the name of Sandford Conover, and
</p>
<p>testified to a tissue of falsehoods before the Military Commission at Washington,
</p>
<p>which advertisement was published in the papers.
</p>
<p>To the3e facts Mr. Conover now testifies, arid a'so discloses the fact that these

</p>
<p>fact made, and which was publishfd in a newspaper at that time, produced
</p>
<p>here, is bs'c out substantially upon your record, and agree3 with the testimony
</p>
<p>upon tho same point given by him in this Court.
</p>
<p>To suppose that Conover ever made such an affidavit voluntarily as the one
</p>
<p>wrung from him as stated is impossible. Would he advertise for his own ar
</p>
<p>rest, and charge himself with falsely impersonating himself ? But the fact can
</p>
<p>not evade ob3orvation that, when these guilty conspirators saw Conover's testi
</p>
<p>mony before this Court in the public prints, revealing to the world the atro
</p>
<p>cious plots of these felon conspirators, consoiou3 of the truthfulness of his state
</p>
<p>ments, they cast about at once for some defence before the public, and devised the
</p>
<p>foolish and stupid invention of compelling him to make an affidavit that he was
</p>
<p>not Sandford Conover, was not in this Court, never gave tbi3 testimony, but
</p>
<p>was a practicing lawsr at Montreal. This infamous proceeding, coupled with
</p>
<p>the evidence-before detailed, stamp3 these ruffian plotters with the guilt of this
</p>
<p>conspiracy. John Wilkes Booth having entered into this conspiracy in Canada, as has
</p>
<p>boen shown, as early as October, lie is next found in the city of New York, on
</p>
<p>the 11th day, as I claim of November, in disguise, in conversation with another,
</p>
<p>tho conversation disclosing to the witness, Mrs. Hudspeth, that they had some
</p>
<p>m.itter of personal interest between them ; that upon one of them the lot had
</p>
<p>fallen to go to Washington ; upon the other to go to Newbern. This witness
</p>
<p>upon being shown the photograph of Booth swears " that the face is the same"

<p>322 TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS.
</p>
<p>as that of one of those men, who she says.was a man of education and culture,
</p>
<p>as appeared by his conversation, and who had a scar like a bite near the jaw
</p>
<p>bone. It is a fact proved here by the Surgeon-General, that Booth had a sear
</p>
<p>on the side of his neck.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hudspeth heard him say he would leave for Washington the day after
</p>
<p>to-morrow. Hi3 companion appeared angry because it had not fallen on him
</p>
<p>to go to Washington. This took place after the Presidential election in Novem
</p>
<p>ber. She can not fix the precise date, but says she was told General Butler
</p>
<p>left New York on that day. The testimony discloses that General Butler's
</p>
<p>army was on the 11th of INovember leaving New York. The register of the
</p>
<p>National Hotel shows that Booth left Washington on the early morning train,
</p>
<p>November 11, and that he returned to this city on the 14th. Chester testifies
</p>
<p>positively to Booth's presence in New York early in November.
</p>
<p>This testimony shows most conclusively that Booth was in New York on the
</p>
<p>11th of November. The early morning train on which he left Washington
</p>
<p>would reach New York early in the afternoon of that day. Chester saw him
</p>
<p>there 'early in November, and Mrs. Hudspeth not only identifies his picture,
</p>
<p>hut describes his person. The scar upon his neck near his jaw was peculiar,
</p>
<p>and is well described by the witness as like a bite. On that day Booth had a
</p>
<p>letter, in his possession which he accidently dropped in the street car in the
</p>
<p>presence of Mrs. Hudspeth, the witness, who delivered it to Major-General Dix
</p>
<p>the same day, and by whom, as his letter on file before this Court shows, the
</p>
<p>same was transmitted to the War Department November 17, 1864. That letter
</p>
<p>contains these words :
</p>
<p>"Deak Louis :  The time has at last come that we have, all so wished for,
</p>
<p>and upon you every thing depends. As it was decided before you left, we
</p>
<p>were to cast lots. We accordingly did so, and you are to be the Charlotte Cor-

</p>
<p>that was taken by us, you will feel there is no drawback. Abe must die, and
</p>
<p>now. You can choose your wepaons  the cup, the knife, the bullet. The cup
</p>
<p>failed us once, and might again. Johnson, who will give this, has been like
</p>
<p>an enraged demon since the meeting, because it has not fallen on him to rid
</p>
<p>the world of a monster. * * You know where to find yoj.r friends. Your

<p>telegraphic despatch would catch you. The English gentleman, Harcourt, must
</p>
<p>not act hastily. Remember, he has ten days. Strike for your home, strike for
</p>
<p>your country ; bide your time, but strike sure. Get introduced ; congratulate
</p>
<p>him ; listen to his stories ; (not many more will the brute tell to earthly friends ;)
</p>
<p>do anything but fail, and meet us at the appointed place within the fortnight.
</p>
<p>You will probably hear from me in Washington. Sanders is doing us no good in
</p>
<p>Canada. "Chas. Selbv."
</p>
<p>The learned gentleman, (Mr. Cox), in his very able and carefully considered
</p>
<p>argument in defense of O'Laughlin and Arnold, attached importance to this letter,
</p>
<p>and doubtless very clearly saw its bearing upon the case, and, therefore, under
</p>
<p>took to show that the witness, Mrs. Hudspeth, must be mistaken as to the person
</p>
<p>of Booth. The gentleman assumes that the letter of General Dix, of the 17th of
</p>
<p>November last, transmitting this lotter to the War Department, reads that the
</p>
<p>party who dropped the letter was heard to say that he would start to Washington
</p>
<p>on Friday night next, although the word " next" is not in the letter, neither is it
</p>
<p>in the quotation which the gentleman makes, for he quotes it fairly ; yet he con
</p>
<p>cludes that this would bs the 18th of November.
</p>
<p>Now the fact is, the 11th of November last was Friday, and the register of the
</p>
<p>National Hotel bears witness that Mrs. Hudspeth is not mistaken ; because her
</p>
<p>language is, that Booth said he would leave for Washington day after to-morrow,
</p>
<p>which would be Sunday, the 13th, and if in the evening, would bring him to Wash
</p>
<p>ington on Monday, the 14th of November, the day on which the register shows he
</p>
<p>did return to the National Hotel. As to the improbability which the gentleman
</p>
<p>, raises, on the conversation happening in a street ear, crowded with people, there
</p>
<p>was nothing that transpired, although the conversation was earnest, which enabled
</p>
<p>TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS. 323
</p>
<p>the witness, or corild have enabled any one, in the absence of this letter, or of the
</p>
<p>subsequent conduct of Booth to form the least idea of the subject-matter of their
</p>
<p>conversation. The gentleman does not deal altogether fairly in his remarks touching the letter
</p>
<p>of General Dix ; because, upon a careful examination of the letter, it will be found
</p>
<p>that he did not form any such judgment as that it was a hoax for the Sunday Mer

<p>cury, but he took care to forward it to the Department, and asked attention to it ;
</p>
<p>when, as appears by the testimony of the Assistant Secretary of War, Mr. Dana,
</p>
<p>the letter was delivered to Mr. Lincoln, who considered it important enough to
</p>
<p>endorse it with the word " Assassination, " and file it in his office, where it was
</p>
<p>found after the commission of this crime, and brought into this court to bear wit
</p>
<p>ness against his assassins.
</p>
<p>Although this letter would imply that the assassination spoken of was to take
</p>
<p>place speedily, yet the party was to bide his time. Though he had entered into
</p>
<p>the preliminary arrangements in Canada, although conspirators had doubtless
</p>
<p>agreed to co-operate with him in the commission of the crime, and lots had been
</p>
<p>cast for tho chief part in the bloody drama, yet it remained for him as the leader
</p>
<p>and principal of the hired assassins, by whose hand their employers were to strike
</p>
<p>the murderous blow, to collect about him and bring to Washington such persons
</p>
<p>as would be willing to lend themselves, for a price, to the horrid crime, and likely
</p>
<p>to give the necessary aid and support in its consummation. The letter declares
</p>
<p>that Abrabt.m Lincoln must die, and now, meaning as soon as the agents can be
</p>
<p>employed and the work done. To that end you will bide your time.
</p>
<p>But, says the gentleman, it could not have been the same conspiracy charged
</p>
<p>here to which this letter refers. Why not? It is charged here that Booth, with
</p>
<p>the accused and others, conspired to kill and murder Abraham Lincoln ; that is
</p>
<p>precisely tho conspiracy disclosed in the letter. Granted that the parties on trial
</p>
<p>had not then entered into the combination ; if they at any time afterward entered
</p>
<p>into it they became parties to it, and the conspiracy was still the same. But, says
</p>
<p>the gentleman, the words of the letter imply that the conspiracy was to be execut
</p>
<p>ed within the fortnight. Booth is directed, by the name of Louis, to meet the
</p>
<p>writer within a fortnight. It by no means follows that he was to strike within the
</p>
<p>fortnight because he was to meet his co-conspirator within that time, and any such
</p>
<p>conclusion is excluded by the words, "Bide your time."
</p>
<p>Even if the conspiracy was to be executed within the fortnight, and was not so

</p>
<p>executed, and the same party, Booth, afterwards, by concert and agreemen t with
</p>
<p>the accused and others, did execute it by " striking sure" and killing the President,
</p>
<p>that act, whenever done, would be but the execution of this same conspiracy. The
</p>
<p>letter is conclusive evidence of so much of this conspiracy as relates to the murder
</p>
<p>of President Lincoln. As Booth was to do anything but fail, he immediately there
</p>
<p>after sought out the agents to enable him to strike sure, and execute all that he had
</p>
<p>agreed with Davis and his co-confederates in Canada to do  to murder the Presi
</p>
<p>dent, the Secretary of State, the Vice-President, General Grant and Secretary
</p>
<p>Stanton. Even Booth's co-conspirator, Payne, now on his trial, by his -defence admits all
</p>
<p>this, and says Booth had just been to Canada, "was filled with a mighty scheme,
</p>
<p>and was lying in wait for agents. " Booth asked the co-operation of the prisoner
</p>
<p>Payne, and said:  "I will give you as much money as you want ; but first you
</p>
<p>must swear to stick by me. It is in the oil business. This you are told by the ac
</p>
<p>cused was early in March last. Thus guilt bears witness against itself.
</p>
<p>We find Booth in New York in November, December and January, urging
</p>
<p>Chester to enter into this combination, assuring him that there was money in it ;
</p>
<p>that they had "friends on the other side," that if he would only participate in it,
</p>
<p>he would never want for money while he lived, and all that was asked of him was
</p>
<p>to stand at and open the back door of Ford's Theatre. Booth, in his interview
</p>
<p>with Chester, confesses that he is without money himself, and allows Chester to
</p>
<p>reimburse him the fifty dollars which he (Booth I had transmitted to him in a let
</p>
<p>ter for the purpose of paying his expenses to Washington as one of the parties to
</p>
<p>324 TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS.
</p>
<p>this conspiracy. Booth told him, although he himself was penniless, "there is
</p>
<p>money in this, we have friends on the other side, '.' and if you will but engage, I
</p>
<p>will have three thousand dollars deposited nt once for the use of your family.
</p>
<p>Failing to secure the services of Chester, because his soul recoiled with abhor-
</p>
<p>| rence from the foul work of assassination and murder, he found more willing in
</p>
<p>struments in others whom he gathered about him. Men to commit the assassina
</p>
<p>tions, horses to secure speedy and certain escape were to be provided, and to this
</p>
<p>end Booth, with an energy worthy of a better cause, applies himself. For this lat
</p>
<p>ter purpose he told Chester he had already expended $5,000. In the latter part of
</p>
<p>November, 1864, he visits Charles county, Maryland, and is in company with one
</p>
<p>of the prisoners, Dri Samuel A. Mudd, with whom he lodged over night, and
</p>
<p>through whom he procures of Gardener one of the several horses which were at his
</p>
<p>disposal, and used by him and his co-conspirators in Washington on the night of
</p>
<p>the assassination.
</p>
<p>Some time in January last, it is in testimony, that the prisoner Mudd intro
</p>
<p>duced Booth to John H. Surratt and the witness Weichman ; that Booth invited
</p>
<p>them to the National Hotel ; that when there, in the room which Booth took
</p>
<p>them, Mudd went out into the passage, called Booth out and had a private con
</p>
<p>versation with him, leaving the witness and Surratt in the room. Upon their
</p>
<p>return to the room Booth went out with Surratt, and upon their coming ih, all
</p>
<p>three, Booth, Surratt, and Samuel A. Mudd, went out together, and had a con
</p>
<p>versation in the passage, leaving the witne3S alone. Up to the time of this in
</p>
<p>terview it seems that neither the witness nor Surratt had any knowledge of
</p>
<p>Booth, as they were then introduced to him by Dr. Mudd. Whether Surratt
</p>
<p>had in fact previously known Booth it is not important to inquire. Mudd deem
</p>
<p>ed it necessary, perhaps, a wise precaution, to introduce Surratt to Booth ; he
</p>
<p>also deemed it necessary to have a private conversation with Booth shortly af
</p>
<p>terwards, aud directly upon that to have a conversation together, with Booth
</p>
<p>and Surratt alone.
</p>
<p>Had this conversation, no part of which was heard by the witness, been perfectly
</p>
<p>innocent, it is not to he presumed that Dr. Mudd, who was an entire stranger to
</p>
<p>Weichman, would have deemed it necessary to hold the conversation secretly, nor
</p>
<p>to have volunteered to tell the witness, or rather pretend to tell him, what the con
</p>
<p>versation was ; yet he did say to the witness, upon their return to the room, by way

</p>
<p>of apology, I suppose, for the privacy of the conversation, that Booth had some
</p>
<p>private business with him, and wished to purchase his farm. This silly device, as
</p>
<p>is often the case in attempts at deception, failed in tho execution ; for it remains to
</p>
<p>be shown how the fact that Mudd had private business with Booth, and that Booth
</p>
<p>wished to purchase his farm, made it at all necessary or even proper that they should
</p>
<p>both volunteer to call out Surratt, who up to that moment was a stranger to Booth.
</p>
<p>What had Surratt to do with Booth's purchase of Mudd's farm? And, if itwas
</p>
<p>necessary to withdraw and talk by themselves secretly about the sale of the farm,
</p>
<p>why should they disclose the fact to the very man from whom they had concealed it ?
</p>
<p>Upon the return of these three parties to the room, they seated themselves at a
</p>
<p>table, and upon the back of an envelope Booth traced lines with a pencil, indicat
</p>
<p>ing, as the witness states, the direction of roads. Why was this done? As Booth
</p>
<p>hail been previously in that section of country, as the prisoner in his defence
</p>
<p>has taken great pains to show, it was certainly not necessary to anything connected
</p>
<p>with the purchase of Mudd's farm that at that time he should be indicating the di
</p>
<p>rection of roads to or from it ; nor is it made to appear by anything in this testimo
</p>
<p>ny, how it comes that Surratt, as the witness testifies, ssemed to he .as much inter
</p>
<p>ested in tho marking out of these roads as Mudd or Booth. It does not appear
</p>
<p>that Surratt was in any wise connected with, or interested in the sale of Sudd's
</p>
<p>farm. Fiom all that has transpired since this meeting at the hotel, it would seem
</p>
<p>that this plotting the roads, was intended, not so much to show the road Jo Mudd's
</p>
<p>farm, as to point out the shortest aud safest route for flight from the Capital, by the
</p>
<p>houses of all the parties in this conspiracy, to their "friends on the other side."
</p>
<p>But, says the learned gentleman (Mr. Ewing), in his very able argument in de-
</p>
<p>TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS. 325
</p>
<p>fence of this prisoner, why should Booth determine that his flight should be
</p>
<p>through Charles county ? The answer must be obvious, upon a moment's reflec
</p>
<p>tion, to eveiy man, and could not possibly have escaped the notice of the counsel
</p>
<p>himself, but for the reason that his zeal for his client constrained him to overlook
</p>
<p>it. ft was absolutely essential that this murderer should have his co-conspirators
</p>
<p>at convenient points along his route, and it does not appear in evidence that by the
</p>
<p>route to his friends, who had then fled from Richmond, which the gentleman (Mr.
</p>
<p>Ewing) indicates as the more direct, but of which there is not the slightest evi
</p>
<p>dence whatever, Booth had co-conspirators at an equal distance from Washington.
</p>
<p>The testimony discloses further, that on the route selected by him foii his flight,
</p>
<p>there is a largo population that would be most likely to favor and aid him in the
</p>
<p>execution of his wicked purpose, and in making his escape. But it is a sufficient
</p>
<p>answer to the gentleman's question, that Booth's co-conspirator, Mudd, lived in
</p>
<p>Charles county.
</p>
<p>To return to the meeting at the hotel. In the light of other facts in this case, it
</p>
<p>must become clear to the Court that this secret meeting between Booth, Surratt
</p>
<p>and Mudd was a conference looking to the execution of this conspiracy. It so im
</p>
<p>pressed the prisoner, it so impressed his counsel, that they deemed it necessary
</p>
<p>and absolutely essential to their defence to attempt to destroy the credibility of the
</p>
<p>witness Weichman.
</p>
<p>I may say here, in passing, that they have not attempted to impeach his general
</p>
<p>reputation tor truth by the testimony of a single witness, nor have they impeached
</p>
<p>his testimony by calling a single witness to discredit one material fact to which he
</p>
<p>has testified in this issue. Failing Tb find abreath of suspicion against Weichman's
</p>
<p>character, or to contradict a single fact to which he testified, the accused had to fly
</p>
<p>to the last resort, an alibi, and very earnestly did the learned counsel devote him
</p>
<p>self to the task.
</p>
<p>It is not material whether this meeting in the hotel took place on the 23d of De
</p>
<p>cember or iu January. But, says the counsel, it was after the commencement or
</p>
<p>close of the Congressional holiday. That is not material ; but the concurrent reso
</p>
<p>lution of Congress shows that the holiday commenced on the 22d December, the
</p>
<p>day before the accused spent the evening in Washington. The witness is not cer
</p>
<p>tain about the date of this meeting. The material fact is, did this meeting take
</p>
<p>place either on tho 23d of December or in January last? Were the private in

</p>
<p>terviews there held, and was the apology made, as detailed, by Mudd and Booth
</p>
<p>after the secret conference to the witness ? That the meeting did take place, and
</p>
<p>that Mudd did explain that these secret interviews, with Booth first, and with
</p>
<p>Booth and Surratt directly afterward, had relation to the sale of his farm, is con
</p>
<p>fessedly admitted by the endsavor of the prisoner, through his counsel, to show that
</p>
<p>negotiations had been going on between Booth and Mudd for the sale of Mudd's
</p>
<p>farm. If no such meeting was held, if no such explanation was made by Mudd to
</p>
<p>Weichman can any man for a moment believe that a witness would have been
</p>
<p>called here to give any testimony about Booth having negotiated for Mudd's farm?
</p>
<p>What conceivable connection has it with this case, except to show that Mudd's
</p>
<p>explanation to Weichman for his extraordinary conduct was in exact accordance
</p>
<p>with the fact ? Or was this testimony about the nsgotiations for Mudd's farm in
</p>
<p>tended to show so close an intimacy and intercourse with Booth that Mudd could
</p>
<p>not fail to recognize him when he came flying for aid to his house from the work of
</p>
<p>assassination ? It would be injustice to the able counsel to suppose that.
</p>
<p>I have said that it was wholly immaterial whether this conversation took place
</p>
<p>on the 23d of December or in January ; it is in evidence that in both those months
</p>
<p>Booth was at the National Hotel ; that he occupied a room there ; that he arrived
</p>
<p>there on the 22d and was there on the 23d of December last, and also on the 12th
</p>
<p>day of January.' The testimony of the witness is, that Booth said he had just
</p>
<p>come in. Suppose this conversation took place in December, on the evening of the
</p>
<p>23d the time when it is proved by J. T. Mudd, the witness for the accused, that
</p>
<p>he, in company with Samuel A Mudd, spent the night in Washington city. Is
</p>
<p>326 TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS.
</p>
<p>there anything in the testimony of that or any other witness to Bhow that the ac
</p>
<p>cused did not have and could not have had an interview with Booth on that even
</p>
<p>ing? J. T. Mudd testifies that he separated from the prisoner, Samuel A. Mudd, at
</p>
<p>the National Hotel, early in the evening of that day, and did not meet him again
</p>
<p>until the accused came in for the night at the Pennsylvania House, where he
</p>
<p>stopped. Where was Dr. Samuel A. Mudd during this interval? What does his
</p>
<p>witness know about him during that time ? How can he say that Dr. Mudd did
</p>
<p>not go up on Seventh street in company with Booth, .then at tho National ; that he
</p>
<p>did not, on Seventh street, meet Surratt and Weichman ; that he did not return to
</p>
<p>the National Hotel ; that he did not have this interview, and afterwards meet him,
</p>
<p>the witness, as he testifies, at the Pennsylvania House ? Who knows that the
</p>
<p>Congressional holiday had not, in fact, commenced on that day? What witness
</p>
<p>has been called to prove that Booth did not on either of those occasions occupy the
</p>
<p>room that had formerly been occupied by a member of Congress, who had tempo
</p>
<p>rarily vacated it, leaving his books there ?
</p>
<p>Weichman, I repeat, is not positive as to the date, he is only positive as to
</p>
<p>the fact ; and he disclosed voluntarily, to this Court, that the date could probably
</p>
<p>be fixed by a refereneo to the register of the Pennsylvania House. That reg
</p>
<p>ister can not, of course, be conclusive of whether Mudd was there in January or
</p>
<p>not, for the very good reason that the proprietor admits that he did not kuow
</p>
<p>Samuel A. Mudd ; therefore, Mudd might have registered by any other name.
</p>
<p>Weichman does not pretend to know that Mudd had registered 'at all. If Mudd
</p>
<p>was here in January, as a party to this conspiracy, it is not at all unlikely that,
</p>
<p>if he did register at that time in the presence of a man to whom he was wholly
</p>
<p>unacquainted, his kinsman not then, being with him, he would register by a
</p>
<p>false name.
</p>
<p>But if the interview took place in December, the testimony of Weichmani
</p>
<p>bears as strongly against the accused as if it had happened in January. Weich
</p>
<p>man says he does not know what time was occupied in this interview at the
</p>
<p>National Hotel ; that it probably lasted twenty minutes ; that after the private
</p>
<p>interviews between Mudd, and Surratt, and Booth, which were not of very long
</p>
<p>duration, had terminated, the parties went to the Pennsylvania House, where
</p>
<p>Dr. Mudd had rooms, and after sitting together in the common sitting-room of
</p>
<p>the hotel, they left Dr. Mudd there about ten o'clock P.M., who remainedduring

</p>
<p>the night. Weiehman's testimony leaves no doubt that this meeting on Seventh
</p>
<p>street and interview at the National took place after dark, and terminated be
</p>
<p>fore or about ten o'clock P. M. His own witneS3, J. T. Mudd, after statiug that
</p>
<p>he separated from the accused at the National Hotel, says after he had got
</p>
<p>through a conversation with a gentleman of his acquaintance, he walked down
</p>
<p>the Avenue, went to several clothing stores, and " after a while" walked rounl
</p>
<p>to the Pennsylvania House, and " very soon after" he got there Dr. Mudd came
</p>
<p>in, and they went to bed shortly afterwards.
</p>
<p>What time he spent in his " walk alone" on the Avenue, looking at clothing ;
</p>
<p>what period he embraces in the terms " after a while," when he returned to
</p>
<p>the Pennsylvania House, and "soon after" which Dr. Mudd got there, the wit
</p>
<p>ness does not disclose. Neither does he intimate, much less testify, that he saw
</p>
<p>Dr. Mudd when he first entered the Pennsylvania House on that night after their
</p>
<p>separation. How does he know that Booth and Surratt and Weichman did not
</p>
<p>accompany Samuel A. Mudd to that house that evening 2 How does he know
</p>
<p>that the prisoner and those persons did not converse together some time in the
</p>
<p>sitting-room of the Pennsylvania House ? Jeremiah Mudd has not testified that
</p>
<p>he met Mr. Mudd in that room, or that he was in it himself.
</p>
<p>He has, however, sworn to the fact, which is disproved by no one, that the
</p>
<p>prisoner was separated from him long enough that evening to have had the
</p>
<p>meeting with Booth, Surratt and Weichman, and the interviews in the National
</p>
<p>Hotel, and at the Pennsylvania House, to which Weichman has testified. Who
</p>
<p>is there to disprove it? Of what importance is it whether it wason tha 23d of
</p>
<p>December or in January? Hpw does that affect the credibility of Weich-
</p>
<p>TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS. 327
</p>
<p>man? He is a man, as I have before said, against whose reputation for truth
</p>
<p>and good conduct they have not been able to bring one witness. If this meet
</p>
<p>ing did by possibility take place that night, is there anything to render it im
</p>
<p>probable that Booth, and Mudd, and Surratt did have the conversation at the
</p>
<p>National Hotel to which Weichman testifies ? Of what avail, therefore, is the
</p>
<p>attempt to prove that Dr. Mudd was not here during January, if it was clear
</p>
<p>that he was here on the 23d of December, 1864, and had this conversation with
</p>
<p>Booth ? That this attempt to prove an alibi during January has failed, is quite
</p>
<p>as clear as the proof of the fact that the prisoner was here on the evening of
</p>
<p>the 23d of December, and present in the National Hotel, where Booth stopped.
</p>
<p>The fact that the prisoner, Samuel A. Mudd. went with J. T. Mudd on that even
</p>
<p>ing to the National Hotel, and there separated from him, is proved by his own
</p>
<p>witness, J. T. Mudd ; and that he did not rejoin him until they retired to bed in the
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania House, is proved by the same witness, and contradicted by no
</p>
<p>body. Does any one suppose there would have been such a-siduous care to
</p>
<p>prove that the prisoner was with his kinsman all the time on the 23d of Decem
</p>
<p>ber in Washington, if they had not known that Booth was then at the National
</p>
<p>Hotel, and that a meeting of the prisoner with Booth, Snrattand Weichman on
</p>
<p>that day would corroborate and confirm Weichmaa's testimony in every material
</p>
<p>statement he made concerning that meeting ?
</p>
<p>The accused having signally failed to account for his absence after he sepa
</p>
<p>rated from his witness, J. T. Mudd, early in the evening of the 23d of December,
</p>
<p>at the National Hotel, until they had again met at the Pennsylvania House, when
</p>
<p>they retired to rest, he now attempts to prove an alibi as to the month of January.
</p>
<p>In this he has failed, as he failed in the attempt to show that he could not have
</p>
<p>met Booth, Surratt and Weichman on th# 23d of December.
</p>
<p>For this purpose the accused calls Betty Washington. She had been at Mudd's
</p>
<p>house every night since the Monday after Christmas last, except when here at
</p>
<p>Court, and says that the prisoner, Mudd, has only been away from home three
</p>
<p>nights during that time. This witness forgets that Mudd has not been at home
</p>
<p>any night or day since this court assemble'l. Neither does she aceount for the
</p>
<p>. three nights in which she sweare to his absence from home. First, she says he
</p>
<p>went to Gardner's party, second, he went to Giesboro, theu to Washington. She
</p>
<p>does not know in what month he was away, the second time, all night. She only

</p>
<p>knows where he went from what he and his wife said, which is not evidence; but
</p>
<p>she does testify that when he left home and was absent over night, the second time,
</p>
<p>it was about two or three weeks after she came to his house, which would, if it
</p>
<p>were three weeks, make it just about the 1 5th of January, 1865, because she swears
</p>
<p>shecame to his hoase on the first Monday after Christmas last, which was the
</p>
<p>26th day of December; so that the 15th of January would be three weeks, less
</p>
<p>one day from that time; and it might have been a week earlier, according to her
</p>
<p>testimony.; as, also, it might have been a week earlier, or more, by Weichman's
</p>
<p>testimony, for he is not positive as to the time.
</p>
<p>What I have said of the register of the Pennsylvania House, the head-quarters
</p>
<p>of Mudd and Atzeroth, I need not here repeat. That record proves nothing, save
</p>
<p>that Dr. Mudd was there on the 23d of December, which, as we have seen, is a
</p>
<p>faet, along with others, to show that the meeting at the National then took place.
</p>
<p>I have also called the attention of the Court to the fact, that if Mudd was at the
</p>
<p>house again in January, and did not register his name, the fact proves nothing ; or,
</p>
<p>if he did, the register only proves that he registered falsely; either of which facts
</p>
<p>might have happened without the knowledge of the witness called by the accused
</p>
<p>from that house, who does not know Samuel A, Mudd personally.
</p>
<p>The testimony of Henry L. Mudd, his brother, in support of this alibi, is that
</p>
<p>the prisoner was in Washington on the 23d of March, and on the 10th of April,
</p>
<p>four days before the murder! But he does not account for the absent night in
</p>
<p>January, about which Betty Washington testifies, Thomas Davis was called for
</p>
<p>the same purpose, but stated that he was himself absent one night in January, af
</p>

</p>
<p>night or not. He does testify to Mudd's absence over night three times, and fixes.

<p>328 TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS.
</p>
<p>one occasion on the night of the 26th of January ; this witness can not account for
</p>
<p>the absence of Mudd on the night referred to by Betty Washington.
</p>
<p>This matter is entitled to no further attention. It can satisfy no one, and the
</p>
<p>"burden of proof is upon the prisoner to prove that he was not in Washington in
</p>
<p>January last. How can such testimony convince any rational man that Mudd was
</p>
<p>not here in January, against the evidence of an unimpeached .witness, who swears
</p>
<p>that Samuel A. Mudd was in Washington in the month of January? Who, that
</p>
<p>has been examined here as a witness, knows that he was not ?
</p>
<p>The Eev. Mr. Evans swears that he saw him in Washington last winter, and
</p>
<p>that at tho same time ha saw Jarboe, the one coming out of, and the other going
</p>
<p>into, a house on H street, which he was informed, on inquiry, was the house of
</p>
<p>Mrs. Surratt. Jarboe is the only witness called to contradict Mr. Evans,- and he
</p>
<p>leaves it in extreme doubt whether he does not' corroborate him, as he swear that
</p>
<p>he was here himself last winter or fall, but can not state exactly the time. Jar-
</p>
<p>boe's silence on questions touching his own credibility leaves no room for any one
</p>
<p>to say that his testimony could impeach Mr. Evans, whatever he might swear.
</p>
<p>Miss Anna H. Surratt is also called for the purpose of impeaching Mr. Evans.
</p>
<p>It is sufficient to say of her testimony on that point that she swears negatiyely only,
</p>
<p>that she did not see either of the persons named at her mother's house. This tes
</p>
<p>timony neither disproves, nor does it even tend to disprove the facf put in issue by
</p>
<p>Mr. Evans. No one will pretend, whatever the form of her expression in giving
</p>
<p>her testimony, that she could say more than that she did not know the fact, as it
</p>
<p>was impossible that she could know who was, or who was not, at her mother's
</p>
<p>house, casually, at a period so remote. ' It is not my purpose, neither is it needful
</p>
<p>here, to question in any way the integrity of this young woman.
</p>
<p>It is further in testimony that Samue'k A. Mudd was here on the 3d of March
</p>
<p>last, the day preceding the inauguration, when Booth was to strike the traitorous
</p>
<p>blow, and it was, doubtless, only by the interposition of that God who stands within
</p>
<p>tho shadow and keeps watch above his, own, that tbe victim of this conspiracy was
</p>
<p>spared that day from the assassin's hand, tbat he might complete his work and see
</p>
<p>the salvation of his country in tho fall of Richmond and the surrender of its great
</p>
<p>army. Dr. Mudd was here on that day (the 3d of M arch\ to abet, to encourage, "
</p>
<p>to nerve his co-conspirator for the commission of this great crime. He was car
</p>
<p>ried away by the awful purpose which possessed him, and rushed into the room of

</p>
<p>Mr. Norton, at the National Hotel, in search of Booth, exclaiming excitedly,
</p>
<p>"I'm mistaken; I thought this was Mr. Booth's room." He is told Mr. Booth is
</p>
<p>above, on the next floor. He is followed by Mr. Norton, because of his rude and
</p>
<p>excited behaviour, and, being followed, conscious of his guilty errand, he turns
</p>
<p>away, afraid of himself and afraid to be found in concert with his fellow confeder
</p>
<p>ate. Mr. Norton identifies the prisoner, and has no doubt that Samuel A. Mudd
</p>
<p>is the man.
</p>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Evans also swears that, after the 1st. and before the 4th day of
</p>
<p>March last, he is certain that within that time, and on the 2d or 3d of March, he
</p>
<p>saw Dr. Mudd drive into Washington City. The endeavor is made by the ac
</p>
<p>cused, in order to break down this witness, by proving another alibi. Tho sister of
</p>
<p>the accused, Miss Fanny Mudd, is called. She testifies that she saw the prisoner
</p>
<p>at breakfast in her father's house on the 2d of March, about five o'clock in the
</p>
<p>morning, and not again until the 3d of March at noon. Mrs. Emily Mudd swears
</p>
<p>substantially to the same statement. Betty Washington, called for the accused,
</p>
<p>swears that he was at home all day at work with her on the 2d of March, and. took
</p>
<p>breakf ist at home. Frank Washington swears that Mudd was at home all day j
</p>
<p>that he saw him when he first came out in the morning, about sunrise, from his
</p>
<p>own house, and knows that he was there all day with them. Which is correct,
</p>
<p>the testimony of his sisters or the testimony of servants ? The sisters say that he
</p>
<p>was at their father's house for breakfast on the morning of the 2d-of March ; the
</p>
<p>servants say he was at home for breakfast with them on that day. If this testimo
</p>
<p>ny is followed, it proves one alibi too much. It is impossible, in the nature of
</p>
<p>things, tha( 'he testimony of all these four witnesses can be true.
</p>
<p>TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS. 329
</p>
<p>Seeing this weakness in the testimony brought to prove this second alibi, the en
</p>
<p>deavor is next made to discredit Mr. Norton for truth ; and two witnesses, not
</p>
<p>more, are called, who testify that his reputation for truth has suffered by contested
</p>
<p>litigation between one of the impeaching witnesses and others. Four witnesses are
</p>
<p>called, who testify that Mr. Norton's reputation for truth is very good ; that he is
</p>
<p>a man for high character for truth, and entitled to be believed whether he speaks
</p>
<p>under the obligation of an oath or not. The late Postmaster-General, Hon. Hora
</p>
<p>tio King, not only sustains Mr. Norton as a man of good reputation for truth, but
</p>
<p>expressly con-oborates his testimony, by stating that in March last, about the 4th of
</p>
<p>March, Mr. Norton told him the same fact to which he swears here  that a man
</p>
<p>came into his room under excitement, alarmed his sister, was followed out by him
</p>
<p>self, and went down stairs instead of going up ; and that Mr. Norton told him this
</p>
<p>before tbe assassination, and about the time of the inauguration.
</p>
<p>What motive had Mr. Norton at that time to fabricate this statement ? It de
</p>
<p>tracts nothing from his testimony that he did not at that time mention the name
</p>
<p>of this man to his friend, Mr. King ; because it appears from his testimony, and
</p>
<p>there is none to question the truthfulness of his statement, that at that time he did
</p>
<p>not know his name. Neither does it take from the force of this testimony that Mr.
</p>
<p>Norton did not, in communicating this matter to Mr. King, make mention of
</p>
<p>Booth's name ; because there was nothing in the transaction at the time, he being
</p>
<p>ignorant of the name of Mudd, and equally ignorant of the conspiracy between
</p>
<p>Mudd and Booth, to give the least occasion for any mention of Booth or of the
</p>
<p>transaction further than he detailed it. With such corroboration, who can doubt
</p>
<p>the factthat Mudd did enter the room of Mr. Norton, and was followed by him, onthe
</p>
<p>3d of March last ? Can he be mistaken in the man ? Who ever looks at the pris
</p>
<p>oner carefully once will be sure to recognute him again.
</p>
<p>For the present I pass from the consideration of the testimony showing Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd's connection with Booth in thi3 conspiracy, with the remark that it is in
</p>
<p>evidence, and I think established, both by the testimony adduced by the pros
</p>
<p>ecution and that by the prisoner, that since the commencement of this rebel
</p>
<p>lion, John H. Surratt visited tbe prisoner's house ; that he concealed Surratt
</p>
<p>and other rebels and traitors in the wood3 near his hou3e, where for several
</p>
<p>days he furnished them with food and bsdding ; that the shelter of the woods
</p>
<p>by night and by day was the only shelter that the prisoner dare furnish those

<p>friends of his ; that in November Booth visited him and remained over night ;
</p>
<p>that he accompanied Booth at that time to Gardner's, from whom he purchased
</p>
<p>one of the horses used on the night of the assassination to aid the escape of one
</p>
<p>of his confederates ; that the prisoner had secret interviews with Booth and
</p>
<p>Surratt, as sworn to by the witness, Weichman, in the National Hotel, whether
</p>
<p>on the 23d of December or in January, is a matter of entire indifference ; that
</p>
<p>he rushed into Mr. Norton's room on the 3d of March in search of Booth, and

<p>that he was here again on the 10th of April, four days before the murder of the

</p>
<p>of all this ; his conspiring with Booth, and his sheltering, concealing, and aid

<p>ing the flight of his co-conspirator, this felon assassin, I shall speak hereafter,
</p>
<p>leaving htm for the present with the remark that the attempt to prove his char
</p>
<p>acter has resulted in showing him in sympathy with the rebellion, so cruel that
</p>
<p>he shot one of his slave3, and declared his purpose to send several of them to
</p>
<p>work ou the rebel batteries in Richmond.
</p>
<p>What others, besides Samuel A. Mudd and John H. Surratt and Lewis Payne,
</p>
<p>did Booth, after his return from Canada, induce to join him in this conspiracy
</p>
<p>to murder the President, the Vice-President, and Secretary of State, and the
</p>
<p>Lieutenant-General, with the intent thereby to aid the rebellion and overthrow
</p>
<p>the government and laws of the United States ?
</p>
<p>On the 10th of February the prisoners Arnold and O'Laughlin came to Wash
</p>
<p>ington and took rooms in the house of Mrs. Vantync ; were armed ; were there
</p>
<p>visited frequently by John Wilkes Booth, and alone ; were occasionally absent
</p>
<p>when Booth called, who seemed anxious, for their return ; would sometimes
</p>
<p>330 TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS.
</p>
<p>leave notes for them, and sometimes a request that when they came in they
</p>
<p>should be told to come to the stable.
</p>
<p>On the 18th of March last, when Booth played in The Apostate, the witness,
</p>
<p>Mrs. Vantyne, received from O'Laughlin complimentary tickets. These persons
</p>
<p>remained there until the 20th of March. They were visited, so far as the wit
</p>
<p>ness knows, during their stay at her house only by Booth, save that on a single
</p>
<p>occasion an unknown man came to see them, and remained with them over
</p>
<p>night. They told the witness they were in the " oil business." With Mudd,
</p>
<p>the guilty purpose was sought to be concealed by declaring that he was in the
</p>
<p>" land business ;" with O'Laughlin and Arnold it was attempted to be conceal
</p>
<p>ed by pretense that they were in the " oil business." Booth, it is proved, had
</p>
<p>closed up all connection with the oil business last September. There is not a
</p>
<p>word of testimony to show that the accused, O'Laughlin and Arnold, ever in
</p>
<p>vested or sought to invest, in any way or to any amount, in the oil business :
</p>
<p>their silly words betray them ; they forget when they uttered that false state
</p>
<p>ment that the truth is strong, next to the Almighty, and that their crime must
</p>
<p>find them out was the irrevocable and irresistible law of nature and of nature's
</p>
<p>God. One of their co-conspirators, known as yet only to the guilty parties to this
</p>
<p>damnable plot and to the Infinite, who will unmask and avenge all blood-
</p>
<p>guiltiness, comes to bear witness, unwittingly, against them. This unknown
</p>
<p>conspirator, who dates his letter at South Branch Bridge, April 6, 1865, mailed
</p>
<p>and postmarked Cumberland, Maryland, and addressed to John Wilkes Booth,
</p>
<p>by his initials, " J. W. B., National Hotel, Washington, D. O," was also in the
</p>
<p>' oil speculation." In that letter he says : 
</p>
<p>" Friend Wilkes : I received yoursof March 12, and reply as soon as practi
</p>
<p>cable. I saw French, Brady, and others about the oil speculation. The sub
</p>
<p>scription to the stock amounts to eight thousand dollars, and I add one thou
</p>
<p>sand myself, which is about all I can stand.' Now, when you sink your well,
</p>
<p>go deep enough ; don'f fail ; everything depends upon you and your helpers.
</p>
<p>If you can not get through on your trip, after you strike oil, strike through
</p>
<p>Thornton Gap and across by Capon, Romney, and down, the Branch. lean
</p>
<p>keep you safe from all hardships for a year. I am clear of all surveillance now
</p>
<p>that infernal Purdy is beat.
</p>
<p>" I send this by Tom, and, if he don't get drunk, you will get it on the 9th.

<p>At all events, it can not be understood if lost

<p>' No more, only Jake will be at Green's with the funds. LON.
</p>
<p>That this letter is not a fabrication is made apparent by the testimony of
</p>
<p>Purdy, whose name occurs in the letter. He testified that he had been a detec
</p>
<p>tive in the government service, and that he had been falsely accused, as the
</p>
<p>letter recites, and put under arrest ; that there was a noted rebel by the name
</p>
<p>of Green, living at Thornton Georgia ; that there was a servant, who drank.
</p>
<p>known as " Tom," in the neighborhood of South Branch Bridge ; that there is
</p>
<p>an obscure route through the Gap, and as described in the letter ; and that a
</p>
<p>man commonly called " ton" lives at South Branch Bridge. If the Court are
</p>
<p>satisfied, and it is for them to judge, that this letter was written before the as
</p>
<p>sassination, as it purports to have been, and on the day of its date, there can be
</p>
<p>no question with any one who reads it that the writer was in the conspiracy,
</p>
<p>and knew that the time of its execution drew nigh. If a conspirator, every
</p>
<p>word of its contents is evidence against every other party to this conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Who can fail to understand this letter? His words " go deep enough," " don't
</p>
<p>fail," " everything depends on you and your helpers," " if you can't get through
</p>
<p>on your trip after you strike oil, strike through Thornton Gap," &e., and " I
</p>
<p>can keep you safe from all hardships for a year," necessarily imply that when
</p>
<p>he " strikes oil" there will be an occasion for a flight ; that a trip, or route, has
</p>
<p>already been determined upon ; tbat he may not be able to go through by that
</p>
<p>route ; in which event he is to strike for Thornton Gap, and across by Capon
</p>
<p>and Romney, and down the Branch, for the shelter which his co-conspirator
</p>
<p>TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS. 331
</p>
<p>offers him. "I am clear, of all surveillance now." Does any one doubt that
</p>
<p>the man who wrote those words wished to assure Booth that he was no longer
</p>
<p>watched, and that Booth could safely hide with him from his pursuers? Does
</p>
<p>any one donbt, from the further expression in this letter, " Jake will he at
</p>
<p>Green's with the funds," that this was a part of the price of blood, or that the
</p>
<p>eight thousand dollars subscribed by others, and the one thousand additional,
</p>
<p>subscribed by the writer, were also a part of the price- to be paid ?
</p>
<p>"The oil business" which was the declared business of O'Laughlin and Ar
</p>
<p>nold, was the declared business of"the infamous writer of this letter ; was the
</p>
<p>declared business of John H. Surratt ; was the declared business of Booth him
</p>
<p>self, as explained to Chester and Hess and Payne ; was " the business" referred
</p>
<p>to in his telegrams to O'Laughlin, and meant the murder of the President, of his
</p>
<p>Cabinet, and of General Grant. The first of these telegrams is dated Washing
</p>
<p>ton, 13th of March, and is addressed to M. 0. Laughlin, No 57 North Exeter
</p>
<p>street, Baltimore, Maryland, and is as follows : ' Don,t you fear to neglect your
</p>
<p>business ; you had better come on at once. J. Booth." The telegraph operator,
</p>
<p>Hoffman, who sent this despatch from Washington, swears that John Wilke3
</p>
<p>Booth delivered it to him in person on the day of its date ; and the handwriting
</p>
<p>of the original telegram is established beyond question to be that of Booth.
</p>
<p>The other telegram is dated Washington, March 27, addressed " M. 0. Laughlin
</p>
<p>Esq., 57 North Exeter street, Baltimore, Maryland," and is as follows :  " Get
</p>
<p>word to Sam. Come on with or without him on Wednesday morning. We sell
</p>
<p>that day sure ; don't fail. J. Wilkes Booth."
</p>
<p>The original of this telegram is also proved to be in the handwriting of Booth.
</p>
<p>The same referred to in this last telegram was doubtless the murder of the Presi
</p>
<p>dent and others, the "oil speculation, "in. which the writer of the letter from South
</p>
<p>Branch Bridge, dated April 6, had taken a thousand dollars, and in which Booth
</p>
<p>said there was money, and Sanders said there was money, and Atzeroth said there
</p>
<p>was money. The words of this telegram, "get word to Sam," meaning Samuel
</p>
<p>Arnold, his co-conspirator ; who had been with him during all his stay at Wash
</p>
<p>ington, at Mrs. Vantyne's. These parties to this conspiracy, after they had gone
</p>
<p>to Baltimore, had additional correspondence with Booth, which the Court must in
</p>
<p>fer had relation to carrying out the purposes of their confederation and agreement.
</p>
<p>The colored witness, Williams, testifies that John Wilkes Booth handed him a

<p>letter for Michael O'Laughlin, and another for Samuel Arnold, in Baltimore, some
</p>
<p>time in March last ; one of which he delivered to O'Laughlin at tbe theatre in Bal
</p>
<p>timore, and the other to a lady at the door where Arnold boarded in Baltimore.
</p>
<p>Their agreement and co-operation in the common object having been thus es
</p>
<p>tablished, the letter written to Booth by the prisoner Arnold, dated March 27,
</p>
<p>1865, the handwriting of which is proved before the Court and which was found
</p>
<p>in Booth's possession after the assassination, becomes testimony against O'Laugh
</p>
<p>lin, as well as against the writer, Arnold, because it is an act done in furtherance
</p>
<p>of their combination. That letter is as follows :
</p>
<p>" Dear John :  Was business so important that you could not remain in Balti
</p>
<p>more till I saw you ? I came in as soon as I could, but found you had gone to
</p>
<p>Washington. I called also to see Mike, but learned from his mother that he had
</p>
<p>gone out with you and had not returned. I concluded, therefore, he had gone
</p>
<p>with you. How inconsiderate you have been ! When I left you, you stated that we
</p>
<p>would not meet in a month or so, and therefore I made application for employment,
</p>
<p>an answer to which I shall receive during the week. I told my parents I had
</p>
<p>ceased with you. Can I, then, under existing circumstances, act as you request ?
</p>
<p>You know full well that the Government suspicions something is going on there,
</p>
<p>therefore the undertaking is becoming more complicated. Why not, for the pres
</p>
<p>ent desist ? For various reasons, which, if you look into, you can readily see
</p>
<p>without my making mention, thereof, you, nor any one, can censure me for my
</p>
<p>present course. You have been its cause, for how can I now come after telling
</p>
<p>them I had left you ? Suspicion rests upon me now from my whole family and
</p>
<p>even parties in the country. 
</p>
<p>" I will be compelled to leave home any how, and how soon I care not. None,
</p>
<p>332 TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS.
</p>
<p>no not one, were more in favor of the enterprise than myself, and to-day would he
</p>
<p>there, had you not done as1 you have. By this, I mean manner of proceeding. I
</p>
<p>am, as you well know, in need. I am, you may say, in rags, whereas, to-day, I
</p>
<p>ought to be well clothed. I do not feel right stalking about with means, and more
</p>
<p>from appearances a beggar. I feel my dependence. But, even all this would
</p>
<p>have been, and was, forgotten, for I was one with you. Time more propitious will
</p>
<p>arrive yet. Do not act rashly or in haste. I would prefer your first query, ' Go
</p>
<p>and see how it will be taken in Richmond,' and ere lon'g, I shall be better prepared
</p>
<p>to again be with you. I dislike writing. Would sooner verbally make known my
</p>
<p>views. Yet your now waiting causes me thus to proceed. Do not in anger peruse
</p>
<p>this. Weigh all I have said, and as a rational man and a friend, you can not cen
</p>
<p>sure or upbraid my conduct. I sincerely trust this, nor aught else that shall or
</p>
<p>may occur, will ever be an obstacle to obliterate our former friendship and attach
</p>
<p>ment. Write me to Baltimore, as I expect to be in about Wednesday or Thurs
</p>
<p>day ; or, if you can possibly come on, I will Tuesday meet you at Baltimore at B.
</p>
<p>"Ever, I subscribe myself, your friend, "Sam."
</p>
<p>Here is the confession of the prisoner Arnold, that he was one with Booth in this
</p>
<p>conspiracy; the further confession that they are suspected by tho Government of
</p>
<p>their country, and the acknowledgment that, since they parted, Booth had com
</p>
<p>municated among other things, a suggestion which leads to the remark in this
</p>
<p>letter, " I would prefer'your first query, 'Go see how it will be taken at Rich
</p>
<p>mond,' and ere long I shall be better prepared to again be with you." This is a
</p>
<p>declaration that affects Arnold, Booth and O'Laughlin alike, if tho Court are satis
</p>
<p>fied, and it is difficult to see how they can have doubt on the subject, that the
</p>
<p>matter to be referred to Richmond is the matter of the assassination of the Presi
</p>
<p>dent and others, to effect which these parties had previously agreed and conspired
</p>
<p>together. It is a matter in testimony, by the declaration of John H. Surratt, who
</p>
<p>is as clearly proved to have been in this conspiracy . and murder as Booth himself,
</p>
<p>that about the very dato of this letter, the 27th of March, upon the suggestion of
</p>
<p>Booth, and with his knowledge and consent, he wont to Richmond, not only to see
</p>
<p>"how it would be taken there, " but to get funds with which to carry out the enter
</p>
<p>prise, as Booth had already declared to Chester, in one ofhis last interviews, when
</p>
<p>he said that he or " some one of the party " would be constrained to go to Rich
</p>
<p>mond for funds to cany out the conspiracy. Surratt returned from Richmond,

<p>bringing with him some part of the money for which he went, and was then going
</p>
<p>to Canada, and, as the testimony discloses, bringing with him the despatches from
</p>
<p>Jefferson Davis to his chief agents in Canada, which, as Thompson declared to
</p>
<p>Conover, made the proposed assassination "all right." Surratt, after seeing the
</p>
<p>parties here, left immediately for Canada, and delivered his despatches to Jacob
</p>
<p>Thompson, the agent of Jefferson Davis. This was done by Surratt upon the
</p>
<p>suggestion, or in exact accordance with the suggestion of Arnold, made on the

<p>27th of A.'arch, in his letter to Booth, just read, and yet you are giavely told that

<p>four weeks before the 27th of March Arnold had abandoned the conspiracy.

<p>Surratt reached Canada with these despatches, as we have seen, about the 6th

<p>or 7th of April last, when the witness, Conover, saw them delivered to Jacob
</p>
<p>Thompson, and heard their contents stated by Thompson, and the declaration from
</p>
<p>him that these despatches made it "all right." That Surratt was at that time in
</p>
<p>Canada, is not only established by the testimony of Conover, but it is also in evi
</p>
<p>dence that he told Weichman, on the 3d of April, that he was going to Canada,
</p>
<p>and on that day left for Canada, and afterwards, two letters addressed by Surratt,
</p>
<p>over the fictitious signature of John Harrison, to his mother, and to Miss Ward,
</p>
<p>dated at Montreal, were received by them on the 14th of April, as testified by
</p>
<p>Weichman and by Miss Ward, a witness called lor the defence. Thus it appears
</p>
<p>that tho condition named by Arnold in his letter had been complied with. Booth
</p>
<p>had "gone to Richmond " in the person of Surratt, "to see how it would bo tak
</p>
<p>en." Tho rebel authorities at Richmond had approved it, the agent had returned ;
</p>
<p>and Arnold was, in his own words, thereby the better prepared to join Booth in the
</p>
<p>prosecution of this conspiracy.
</p>
<p>TRIAL OF THE ASSASSINS. 333
</p>
<p>To this end Arnold went to Fortress Monroe. As his letter expressly declares,
</p>
<p>Booth said when they parted, "we would not meet in a month or so, and therefore
</p>
<p>I made application for employment  an answer to which I shall receive during the
</p>
<p>week." He did receive the answer that week from Fortress Monroe, and went
</p>
<p>there to await the " more propitious time, " bearing with him the weapon of death
</p>
<p>which Booth had provided, and ready to obey his call, as the act had been ap
</p>
<p>proved at Richmond, and been made "all right." Acting upon the same fact that
</p>
<p>the conspiracy had been approved in Richmond, and the funds provided, O'Laugh-
</p>
<p> lin came to Washington to identify General Grant, the person who was to become
</p>
<p>the victim of his violence in the final consummation of this crime  General Grant
</p>
<p>whom, as is averred in the specification, it had become the part of O'Laughlin by
</p>
<p>his agreement in this conspiracy, to kill and murder.
</p>
<p>On the evening preceding the assassination, the 13th of April, by the testimony
</p>
<p>of three reputable witnesses, against whose truthfulness not one word is uttered
</p>
<p>here or elsewhere, O'Laughlin went into the house of the Secretary of War, where
</p>
<p>General Grant then was, and placed himself in position in the hall where he could
</p>
<p>see him, having declared before he reached that point to one of these witnesses that
</p>
<p>he wished to see General Grant. The house was brilliantly illuminated at the
</p>
<p>time ; two, at least, of the witnesses conversed with the accused, and the other
</p>
<p>stood very near to him, took special notice of his conduct, called attention to it,
</p>
<p>and suggested that he be put out of the house and he was accordingly put out by
</p>
<p>one of the witnesses. These witnesses are confident and have no doubt, and so
</p>
<p>swear upon their oaths, that Michael O'Laughlin is the man who was present on
</p>
<p>that occasion.
</p>
<p>There is no denial on the part of the accused that he was in Washington during
</p>
<p>tho day and during the night of April 13th, and also during the day aud during
</p>
<p>the night of the 14th ; and yet, to get rid of this testimony, recouiso is had to
</p>
<p>that common device  an alibi: a device never, I may say, moro frequently re
</p>
<p>sorted to than in this trial. But what an alibi ! Nobody is called to prove it,
</p>
<p>save some men who, by their own testimony, were engaged in a drunken debauch
</p>
<p>through the evening. A reasonable man who reads their evidence can hardly be
</p>
<p>expected to allow it to outweigh the united testimony of three unimpeached
</p>
<p>and unimpeachable witnesses, who were clear in their statements, who entertain no
</p>
<p>doubt of the truth of what they say, whose opportunities to know were full and

</p>
<p>complete, and who were constrained to take special notice of the prisoner by reason
</p>
<p>of his extraordinary conduct.
</p>
<p>These witnesses describe accurately the appearance, stature and complexion of
</p>
<p>the accused, but, because they describe his clothiug as dark or black, it is urged
</p>
<p>that as part of his clothing, although dark, was not black, the witnesses are mis
</p>
<p>taken. O'Laughlin and his drunken companions (one of whom swears ho drank
</p>
<p>ton times that evening) were strolling in the streets and in the direction of the
</p>
<p>house of the Secretary of War up the avenue ; but you are asked to believe that
</p>
<p>these witnesses could not be mistaken in saying they were not off the avenue, above
</p>
<p>Seventh street, or on K street. I venture to say that no man who read i their tes
</p>
<p>timony can determine satisfactorily, all the places that were visited by O'Laughlin
</p>
<p>and his drunken associates that evening from seven to eleven P. M. All this time,
</p>
<p>from seven to eleven P. M., must be accounted for satisfactorily before an alibi cm
</p>
<p>be established. Laughlin does not account for all the time, for ho left O'Laughlin
</p>
<p>after seven o'clock, and rejoined him, as ho says, " 1 suppose about eight o'clock."
</p>
<p>Grillet did not meet him until half-past ten, and then only casually saw him in
</p>
<p>passing the hotel. May not Grillet have been mistaken as to the fact, although
</p>
<p>he did meet O'Laughlin after eleven o'clock, the same evening as he swears?
</p>
<p>Purdv swears to seeing him in the bar with Grillet about half-past ten, but, as
</p>
<p>we have seen by Grillet's testimony it must have been after eleven o'clock. Mur
</p>
<p>phy contradicts, as to time, both Grillet and Purdy, for be says it was half-past
</p>
<p>eleven or twelve o'clock when he and O'Laughlin returned to Ruilman's from
</p>
<p>l'lalz's; and Early swears the accused went from Ruilman's to Second street to a
</p>
<p>dance, about a quarter past eleven o'clock, when O'Laughlin took tho lead in the
</p>
<p>334 TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS.
</p>
<p>dance, and stayed about one hour. I follow these witnesses no further. They con
</p>
<p>tradict each other, and do not account for O'Laughlin all the time from seven to
</p>
<p>eleven o'clock. I repeat that no man can read their testimony without finding con
</p>
<p>tradictions most material as to time, and coming to the conviction that they utterly
</p>
<p>fail to account for O'Laughlin's whereabouts on that evening. To establish an
</p>
<p>alibi the witnesses must know the fact and testify to it. O'Laughlin, Grillet, Pur
</p>
<p>dy, Murphy and Earley utterly failed to prove it, and only succeed in showing
</p>
<p>that they did not know where O'Laughlin was all this time, and that some of them
</p>
<p>were grossly mistaken in what they testified, both as to time and place.
</p>
<p>The testimony of James B. Henderson is equally unsatisfactory. He is con
</p>
<p>tradicted by other testimony of the accused as to place. He says O'Laughlin went
</p>
<p>up the avenue above Seventh street, but that he did not go to Ninth street. The
</p>
<p>other witnesses swear he went to Ninth street. He swears he went to the Canterbury
</p>
<p>about 9 o'clock, after going back from Seventh street to Ruilman's. Laughlin swears
</p>
<p>that O 'Laughlin was with him at the corner of the avenue and Ninth street at 9 o'clock
</p>
<p>and went from thereto Canterbury, while Early swears that O'Laughlin went up
</p>
<p>as far as Eleventh street, and returned and took supper with him at Welcker's
</p>
<p>about 8 o'clock. If these witnesses prove an alibi, it is really against each other.
</p>
<p>It is folly to pretend that they prove facts which make it impossible that O'Laugh
</p>
<p>lin could have been at the house of Secretary Stanton, as three witnesses swear
</p>
<p>he was, on the evening of the 13th of April, looking for General Grant.
</p>
<p>Has it not, by the testimony, thus reviewed, been established prima facie that in
</p>
<p>the months of February, March and April O'Laughlin had combined, confederated
</p>
<p>and agreed with John Wilkes Booth and Samuel Arnold to kill and murder Abra
</p>
<p>ham Lincoln, William H. Seward, Andrew Johnson and Ulysses S. Grant ? Is
</p>
<p>it not established, beyond a shadow of doubt, that Booth had so conspired with
</p>
<p>the Rebel agents in Canada as early as October last ; that he was in search of
</p>
<p>agents to do the work on pay, in the interests of the Rebellion, and that in this
</p>
<p>speculation Arnold and O'Laughlin had joined as early as February, and then, and
</p>
<p>after, with Booth and Surratt, they were in the ' ' oil business, " which was the
</p>
<p>business of assassination by contract as a speculation? If this conspiracy on the
</p>
<p>part of O'Laughlin with Arnold is established even prima facie, the declarations
</p>
<p>and acts of Arnold and Booth, the other conspirators, in furtherance of the com
</p>
<p>mon design, is evidence against O'Laughlin as well as against Arnold himself or

<p>the other parties. The rule of law is that the act or declaration of one conspirator,
</p>
<p>done in pursuance or furtherance of the common design, is the act or declaration of
</p>
<p>all the conspirators. (1 Wharton ; 706 .
</p>
<p>The letter, therefore, of his co-conspirator, Arnold, is evidence against O'Laugh
</p>
<p>lin, because it is an act in the prosecution of the common conspiracy, suggesting
</p>
<p>what should be done in order to make it effective, and which suggestion, as has
</p>
<p>been stated, was followed out. The defence has attempted to avoid the force of
</p>
<p>this letter by reciting the statement of Arnold, made to Horner at the time he was
</p>
<p>arrested, in which he declared, among other things, that the purpose was to abduct
</p>
<p>President Lincoln and take him South ; that it was to be done at the theatre by
</p>
<p>throwing tho President out of the box upon the floor of the stage, when the ac
</p>
<p>cused was to catch him. The very announcement of this testimony excited deri
</p>
<p>sion that such a tragedy meant only to take the President and carry him gently
</p>
<p>away! This pigmy to catch tho giant as the assassins hurled him to the floor from
</p>
<p>an elevation of twelve feet !
</p>
<p>The Court has viewed the theatre, and must be satisfied that Booth, in leaping
</p>
<p>from the President's box, broke his limb. The Court can not fail toconclude that
</p>
<p>this statement of Arnold was but another silly device, like that of "the oil busi
</p>
<p>ness" which, for tho time being, he employed to hide from the knowledge of his
</p>
<p>captor the fact that tho purpose was to murder the President. No man can, for a
</p>
<p>moment, believe that any one of these conspirators hoped or desired, by such a pro
</p>
<p>ceeding as that stated by this prisoner, to take the President alive, in the presence
</p>
<p>of thousands assembled in the theatre, after he had been thus thrown upon the

<p>fljor of the stage, much less to carry him through the city, through the line3 of

</p>
<p>your army, and deliver him into the hands of the rebels. No such purpose was
</p>
<p>expressed or hinted at by the conspirators in Canada, who commissioned Booth
</p>
<p>to let these assassinations on contract. I shall waste not a moment more in
</p>
<p>combatting such an absurdity.
</p>
<p>Arnold does confess that he was a conspirator with Booth in this purposed
</p>
<p>murder ; that Booth had a letter of introduction to Dr. Mudd ; that Booth,
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin, Atzeroth, Surratt, a man with an alias, " Mosby," and another
</p>
<p>whom he does not know, and himself were parties to this conspiracy, and that
</p>
<p>Booth had furnished them all with arms. He concludes this remarkable state
</p>
<p>ment to Horner with the declaration that at that time, to wit : the first week of
</p>
<p>March, or four weeks before he went to Fortress Monroe, he left the conspiracy,
</p>
<p>and that Booth told him to sell his arms if he chose. This is sufficiently answer
</p>
<p>ed by the fact that four weeks afterwards, he wrote his letter to Booth, which
</p>
<p>was found in Booth's possession after the assassination, suggesting to him what
</p>
<p>to do in order to make the conspiracy a succe3S, and by the further fact that
</p>
<p>at the very moment he uttered these declarations, part of his arms were found
</p>
<p>upon his person, and the rest not disposed of, but at his father's house.
</p>
<p>A party to a treasonable and murderous conspiracy against the Government
</p>
<p>of his country can not be held to have abandoned it because he makes such a
</p>
<p>declaration as this, when he is in the hands of the officer of the law ; arrested for
</p>
<p>his crime, and especially when his declaration is in conflict with and expressly
</p>
<p>contradicted by his written acts, and unsupported by any conduct of his which
</p>
<p>becomes a citizen aud a man.
</p>
<p>If he abandoned the conspiracy, why did he not make known the fact to
</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln and his constitutional advisers that these men, armed with
</p>
<p>the weapons of assassination, were daily lying in wait for their lives? To pre
</p>
<p>tend that a man who thus conducts himself for weeks after the pretended aban
</p>
<p>donment, volunteering advice for the successful prosecution of the conspiracy,
</p>
<p>the evidence of which is in writing, and about which there can be no mistake,
</p>
<p>has, in fact, abandoned it, is to insult the common understanding of men.
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin having conspired with Arnold to do this murder, is, therefore, as
</p>
<p>much concluded by the letter of Arnold of the 27th of March as is Arnold him
</p>
<p>self. The further testimony touching O'Laughlin, that of Street, establishes the
</p>
<p>fact that about the 1st of April he saw him in confidential conversation with J.

</p>
<p>Wilkes Booth, in this city, on the Avenue. Another man, whom the witness
</p>
<p>does not know, was in conversation. O'Laughlin called Street to one side, and
</p>
<p>told him Booth was busily engaged with his friend, was talking privately to his
</p>
<p>friend. This remark of O'Laughlin's is attempted to be accounted for, but the
</p>
<p>attempt failed ; his counsel taking the pains to ask what induced O'Laughlin to
</p>
<p>make the remark, received the fit reply "I did not see the interior of Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin's mind ; I can not tell." It is the province of this Court to infer
</p>
<p>why that remark was made, and what it signified.
</p>
<p>That John H. Surratt, George A. Atzeroth, Mary E. Surratt, David E. Harold,
</p>
<p>and Lewis Payne, entered into this conspiracy with Booth, is so very clear upon
</p>
<p>this testimony, that little time need be occupied in bringing again before the
</p>
<p>Court the evidence which establishes it. By the testimony of Weichman we
</p>
<p>find Atzeroth in February at the house of the prisoner, Mrs. Surratt He en
</p>
<p>quired for her or for John when he came, and-remained over night. After
</p>
<p>this, and before the assassination, he visited there frequently, and at that house
</p>
<p>bore the name of " Port Tobacco," the name by which he was known in Cana
</p>
<p>da among the conspirators there. The same witne33 te3tifies that he m;t him
</p>
<p>on the street, when he said he was going to visit Payne at the Herndon House,
</p>
<p>and also accompanied him, along with Harold and John H. Surratt to the thea
</p>
<p>ter in Mareh, to see Booth play in the Apostate.
</p>
<p>At the Pennsylvania House, one or two weeks previous to the assassination,
</p>
<p>Atzeroth made the statement to Lieutenant Keim, when asking for his knife which
</p>
<p>he had left in his room, a knife corresponding in size with the one exhibited in
</p>
<p>Court, "I want that; if one fails I want the other," wearing at the same time his
</p>
<p>336 TRIAL OF THE ASSASSINS.
</p>
<p>revolver at his belt. He also stated to Greenawalt, of the Pennsylvania House, in
</p>
<p>March, that he was nearly broke, but had friends enough to give him as much
</p>
<p>money as would see him through, adding, " I am going away eome of thess days,
</p>
<p>but will return with as much gold as will keep me all my life-time." Mr. Greena
</p>
<p>walt also says that Booth had frequent interviews with Atzeroth, sometimes in the
</p>
<p>room, and at other times Booth would walk in and immediately go out, Atzeroth
</p>
<p>following. John M. Floyd testifies that some six weeks before the assassination, Harold,
</p>
<p>Aizeroth and John H. Surratt came to his house at Surrattsville, bringing with them
</p>
<p>two Spencer carbines, with ammunition, also a rope and wrench. Surratt asked
</p>
<p>the witness tct take care of them and to conceal the carbines. Surratt took him
</p>
<p>into a room in the house, it being his mother's house, and showed the witness
</p>
<p>where to put the carbines, between tho joists on the second floor. The carbines
</p>
<p>were put there according to his directions and concealed. Marcus P. Norton saw
</p>
<p>Atzeroth in conversation with Booth at the National Hotel about the 2d or 3d of
</p>
<p>March ; the conversation was confidential, and the witness accidentally heard them
</p>
<p>talking in regard to President Johnson, and say that " the class of witnesses would
</p>
<p>be of that character that there could bo Httle proven by them." This conversation
</p>
<p>may throw some light on the fact that Atzeroth was found in possession of. Booth s
</p>
<p>bank book !
</p>
<p>Colonel Nevens testifies that on the 12th of April last he saw Atzeroth at the
</p>
<p>Kirkwood House ; that Atzeroth there asked him, a stranger, if he knew where
</p>
<p>Vice President Johnson was, and where Johnson's room was. Colonel Nevens
</p>
<p>showed him where the room of the Vice President was, and told him that the Vice
</p>
<p>President was then at dinner. Atzeroth then looked into the dining-room, where
</p>
<p>Vice President Johnson was dining alone. Robert R. Jones, the clerk at the Kirk
</p>
<p>wood House, states that on the 14th, the day of the murder, two days after this,
</p>
<p>Atzeroth registered his name at the hotel, G. A. Atzeroth, and took No. 126, re
</p>
<p>taining the room that day, and carrying away the key. in this room, after the
</p>
<p>assassination, were found the knife and revolver, with which he intended to mur
</p>
<p>der the Vice President.
</p>
<p>The testimony of all these witnesses leaves no doubt that the prisoner, George
</p>
<p>A. Atzeroth, entered into this conspiracy with Booth ; that he expected to receive
</p>
<p>a large compensation for the services that ho would render in its execution ; that
</p>
<p>he had undertaken the assassination of the Vice President for a price ; that he,

</p>
<p>with Surratt and Harold', rendered the important service of depositing the arms
</p>
<p>and ammunition to be used by Booth and his confederates as a protection to their
</p>
<p>flight after the conspiracy had been executed, and that he was careful to have his
</p>
<p>intended victim pointed out to him, and the room he occupied in tho hotel, so that,
</p>
<p>when he came to perform his horrid work, he would know precisely where, to go
</p>
<p>and whom to strike.
</p>
<p>I take no further notice now of the preparation which this prisoner made for the
</p>
<p>successful execution of this part of the traitorous and murderous design. Tho ques
</p>
<p>tion is, did he enter into this conspirary ? His language, overheard by Mr Norton,
</p>
<p>excludes every other conclusion. Vice President Johnson's name was mentioned in
</p>
<p>that secret conversation with Booth, and the very suggestive expression was made
</p>
<p>between them that "little could be proved by the witnesses." His confession in
</p>
<p>his defence is conclusive of his guilt.
</p>
<p>That Payne was in this conspiracy is confessed in the defence made by his coun
</p>
<p>sel, and is also evident from tho facts proved, that when the conspiracy was being
</p>
<p>organized in Canada, by Thompson, Sanders, Tucker, Cleary, and Clay, this man
</p>
<p>Payne stood at the door of Thompson : was recommended and endorsed by Clay
</p>
<p>with the words. " We trust him ;" that after coming hither he first reported him
</p>
<p>self at tho house of Mrs. Mary E. Surratt, inquired for her and for John H. Sur
</p>
<p>ratt, remained there for four days, having conversation with both of them ; having
</p>
<p>provided himself wi'h means of disguise, was also supplied with pistols and a knife,
</p>
<p>such as he afterwards used, and spurs, preparatory to his flight ; was seen with John

</p>
<p>tion, and now before the Court ; was afterwards provided with lodging at the Hern-
</p>
<p>don House, at the instance of Surratt ; was visited there by Atzeroth, attended
</p>
<p>Booth and Snrratt to Ford's Theatre, occupying with those parties the box, as I
</p>
<p>believe, and which we may readily infer, in which the President was afterwards
</p>
<p>murdered. If further testimony be wanting that he had entered into the conspiracy, it may
</p>
<p>be found in the fact sworn to by Weichman, whose testimony no candid man will
</p>
<p>discredit, that about the 20th of March Mrs. Surratt, in great excitement, and
</p>
<p>weeping, said that her son John had gone away not to return, when about three
</p>
<p>hours subsequently, in the afternoon of the same day, John H. Surratt reappeared,
</p>
<p>came rushing in a state of frenzy into the room, in his mother's house, armed, de
</p>
<p>claring he would shoot whoever came into the room, and proclaiming that his pros
</p>
<p>pects were blasted and his hopes gone ; that soon Payne came into the same room,
</p>
<p>also armed and under great excitement, and was immediately followed by Booth,
</p>
<p>with his riding whip in his hand, who walked rapidly across the floor from side to
</p>
<p>side, so much excited that for some time he did not notice the presence of the wit
</p>
<p>ness. Observing Weichman, the parties then withdrew, upon a suggestion from
</p>
<p>Booth, to an upper room, and there had a private interview. From all that trans
</p>
<p>pired on that occasion it is apparent that when these parties left the house that day
</p>
<p>it was with the full purpose of completing some act essential to the final execution
</p>
<p>of the work of assassination, in conformity with their previous confederation and
</p>
<p>agreement. They returned foiled, from what cause is unknown, dejected, angry
</p>
<p>and covered with confusion.
</p>
<p>It is almost imposing upon the patience of the Court to consume time in demon
</p>
<p>strating tho fact, which none conversant with the testimony of this case can for a
</p>
<p>moment doubt, that John H. Surratt and Mary E. Surratt were as surely in the
</p>
<p>conspiracy to murder the President as John Wilkes Booth himself. You have the
</p>
<p>frequent interviews between John H. Surratt and Booth; -his intimate relations
</p>
<p>with Payne ; his visits from Atzeroth and Harold ; his doposit of the arms to cover
</p>
<p>their flight after the conspiracy should have been executed ; his own declared visit
</p>
<p>to Richmond to do what Booth himself said to Chester must be done, to wit:
</p>
<p>That he or some of the party must go to Riehmond in order to get funds to carry
</p>
<p>out the conspiracy; that he brought back with him gold, the prico of blood, con
</p>
<p>fessing himself that he was there ; that he immediately went to Canada, delivered

<p>One other fact, if any other fact be needed, and I have done with the evidence
</p>
<p>which proves that John H. Surratt entered into this combination ; tbat is, that it
</p>
<p>appears by the testimony of the witness, the cashier of the Ontario Bank, Montreal,
</p>
<p>that Jacob Thompson, about the day these despatches were delivered, and while
</p>
<p>Snrratt was then present in Canada, drew from that Bank of the Rebel funds there
</p>
<p>on deposit, the sum of one hundred and eighty thousand dollars. This being done,
</p>
<p>Surratt finding it safer, doubtless, to go to Canada for the great bulk of funds,
</p>
<p>which were to be distributed among these hired assassins than to attempt to carry
</p>
<p>it through our lines direct from ltichmond, immediately returned to Washington,
</p>
<p>and was present in this city, as is proven by tho testimony of Mr. Keid, on the after
</p>
<p>noon of the 14th of April, the day of the assassination, booted and spurred, ready
</p>
<p>for the flight whenever the fatal blow should have been struck.
</p>
<p>If he was not a conspirator and u party to this great crime, how comes it that
</p>
<p>from that hour to this no man has seen him in the Capital, nor has he been report
</p>
<p>ed anywhere outside of Canada, having arrived at Montreal, as the testimony shows,
</p>
<p>on the 18th of April, four days after the murder. Nothing but his conscious cow
</p>
<p>ardly guilt could possibly induce him to absent iiimself from his mother, as he does,
</p>
<p>upon her trial. Being one of these conspirators, as charged, every act of his in tho
</p>
<p>prosecution of this crime is evidence against the other parties to the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>That Mary E. Surratt; is as guilty as her son of having thus conspired, combined
</p>
<p>22
</p>
<p>338 TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS.
</p>
<p>and confederated to dp this murder,' in aid of this Rebellion, is' clear. First,' her
</p>
<p>house was the head-quarters of Booth, John H. Surratt, Atzeroth, Payne and
</p>
<p>Harold. She is inquired for by Atzeroth ; she is inquired for by Payne, and she
</p>
<p>is visited by Booth, and holds private conversations with him. His picture, to
</p>
<p>gether with that of the chief conspirator, Jefferson Davis, is found in her house.
</p>
<p>She sends to Booth for a carriage to take her, on the 11th of April, to Surrattsville,
</p>
<p>for the purpose of perfecting the arrangement deemed necessary to the successful
</p>
<p>execution of the conspiracy, and especially to facilitate and protect the conspirators
</p>
<p>in their escape from justice. On that occasion Booth, having disposed of his car
</p>
<p>riage, gives to the agent she employed ten dollars with which to hire a conveyance
</p>
<p>for that purpose.
</p>
<p>And yet the pretence is made that Mrs. Surratt went on the 11th to Surrattsville
</p>
<p>. exclusively upon her own private and lawful business. Can any one tell, if that be
</p>
<p>so, how it comes that she should apply to Booth for a conveyance, and how it comes
</p>
<p>that he, of his own accord, having no conveyance to furnish her, should send her
</p>
<p>ten dollars with which to procure it? There is not the slightest indication that
</p>
<p>Booth was under any obligation to her, or that she had any claim upon him, either
</p>
<p>for a conveyance or for the means with which to procure one, except that he was
</p>
<p>bound to contribute, being the agent of the conspirators in Canada and Richmond,
</p>
<p>whenever money might be necessary to the consummation of this infernal plot.
</p>
<p>On that day, the 11th of April, John H. Surratt had not returned from Canada
</p>
<p>with the funds furnished by Thompson.
</p>
<p>Upon that journey of the 11th, the accused, Mary E. Surratt, met the witnesss,
</p>
<p>John M. Floyd, at Uniontown, She called him, he got out of his carriage and
</p>
<p>came to her, and she whispered to him in so low a tone that her attendant could
</p>
<p>not hear the words, though Floyd, to whom they were spoken, did distinctly hear
</p>
<p>them, and testifies that she told him he should have those ' ' shooting irons" ready,
</p>
<p>meaning the carbines which her son and Harold and Atzeroth had deposited with
</p>
<p>him, and added the reason, "for they would soon be called for." On the day ot
</p>
<p>the assassination she again sent for Booth, had an interview with him in her own
</p>
<p>house, and immediately went again to Surrattsville, and then, at about 6 o'clock
</p>
<p>in the afternoon, she delivered to Floyd a field-glass, and told him to "have two
</p>
<p>bottles of whisky and the carbines ready, as they would be called for that night."
</p>
<p>Having thus perfected the arrangement, she returned to Washington to her own

<p>house, at about half-past eight o'clock in the evening to await the final result. How
</p>
<p>could this woman anticipate on Friday afternoon, at six o'clock) that these arms
</p>
<p>would be called for and would be needed tbat night, unless she was in the conspira
</p>
<p>cy and knew that the blow was to be struck, and the flight of the assassins at
</p>
<p>tempted, and by that route? Was not the private conversation which Booth held
</p>
<p>with her in her parlor on the afternoon of the 14th of April, just before she left on
</p>
<p>.this business, in relation to the orders she should give to have the arms readv?
</p>
<p>An endeavor is made to impeach Floyd. But the Court will observe that no
</p>
<p>witness has been called who contradicts Floyd's statement in any material manner
</p>
<p>neither has his general character for truth been assailed. How then is he impeach
</p>
<p>ed? Is it claimed that his testimony shows that he was a party to the conspiracy?
</p>
<p>Then it is conceded by those who set up any such pretence that there was a con
</p>
<p>spiracy. A conspiracy between whom ? There can bo no conspiracy without the
</p>
<p>*o-operation or agreement of two or more persons. Who were the other parties to
</p>
<p>it? Was it Mary E. Surratt? Was it John H. Surratt, George A. Atzeroth,
</p>
<p>David E. Harold ? These are the only persons, so far as his own testimony or the
</p>
<p>.testimony of any other witness discloses, with whom he had any communication
</p>
<p>whatever on any subject immediately or remotely touching this conspiracy before
</p>
<p>.the assassination. His receipt and concealment of the arms are, unexplained, evi-
</p>
<p>.dence that he was in the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>The explanation is, that he was dependent upon Mary E. Surratt ; was her tenant 
</p>
<p>and his declaration given in evidence by the accused himself, is, that "she had
</p>
<p>ruined him, and brought this trouble upon him. " But because he was weak enough,
</p>
<p>( or wicked enough, to become the guilty depositary of these arms, and to deliver
</p>
<p>TRIAL OF THE ASSASSINS. 339
</p>
<p>them on the order of Mary E. Surratt to the assassins, it does not follow that he is
</p>
<p>not to be believed on oath. It is said that he concealed the facts that the arms had
</p>
<p>been left and called for. He so testifies himself, but he gives the reason that he
</p>
<p>did it only from apprehension of danger to his life. If he were in the conspiracy,
</p>
<p>his general credit being unchallenged, his testimony being uncontradicted in any
</p>
<p>material manner, he is to be believed, and can not be disbelieved, if his testimony
</p>
<p>is substantially corroborated by other reliable witnesses. Is he not corroborated
</p>
<p>touching the deposit of arms by the fact that the arms are produced in Court ? one
</p>
<p>of which was found upon the person of Booth at the time he was overtaken and
</p>
<p>slain, and which is identified as the same which had been left with Floyd by Harold,
</p>
<p>Surratt and Atzeroth ? Is he not corroborated in the fact of the first interview
</p>
<p>with Mrs. Surratt by the joint testimony of Mrs. Offut and Lewis J. Weichman,
</p>
<p>each of whom testified, and they are contradicted by no one, that on Tuesday, the
</p>
<p>11th day of April, at Uniontown, Mrs. Surratt called Floyd to come to her, which
</p>
<p>he did, and she held a secret conversation wi.h him ? Is he not corroborated as to
</p>
<p>she last conversation, on the 14th of April, by the testimony of Mrs. Offut, who
</p>
<p>jwears, that upon the evening of the 1 kh of April she saw the prisoner, Mary E.
</p>
<p>Surratt, at Floyd's house, approach and hold conversation with him? Is he not
</p>
<p>corroborated in the fact to which he swears, that Mrs. Surratt delivered to him
</p>
<p>at that time the field-glass wrapped in paper, by the sworn statement of Weich
</p>
<p>man, that Mrs. Surratt took with her on that occasion two packages, both of
</p>
<p>which were wrapped in paper, and one of which he describes as a small pack
</p>
<p>age, about six inches in diameter? The attempt was made, by calling Mrs. Offut
</p>
<p>to prove that no such package was delivered, but it failed ; she merely states,
</p>
<p>that Mrs. Surratt delivered a package wrapped in paper to her after her arri
</p>
<p>val there, and before Floyd came in, which was laid down in the room. But
</p>
<p>v whether it was the package about which Floyd testifies, or the other package
</p>
<p>of the two about which Weichman testifies, as having been carried there that
</p>
<p>day by Mrs. Surratt, does not appear. Neither does this witness pretend to say
</p>
<p>tbat Mrs. Surratt, after she had delivered it to her, and the witness had laid it
</p>
<p>down in the room, did not again take it up. if it were the same, and put it in the
</p>
<p>hands of Floyd. She only knows that she did not see that done ; but she did
</p>
<p>see Floyd with a package like the one she received in the room before Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt left. How it came into his possession she is not able to state ; nor

</p>
<p>But there is one other fact in this case that puts forever at rest the question of
</p>
<p>the guilty participation of the prisoner, Mrs. Surratt, in the conspiracy and mur

<p>der ; and that is that Payne, Who had lodged four days in her house ; who during
</p>
<p>all that time had sat at her table, and who had often conversed with her ; when
</p>
<p>the guilt of his great crime was upon him, and he' knew not where else he could so
</p>
<p>safely go to find a co-conspirator, and he could trust none that was not like him
</p>
<p>self, guilty, with even the knowledge of his presence ; under cover of darkness,
</p>
<p>after wandering for three days and nights, skulking before the pursuing officers of
</p>
<p>justice, at the hour of midnight, found his way to the door of Mrs. Surratt, rang
</p>
<p>the bell, was admitted, and upon being asked, " whom do you want to see?" re
</p>
<p>plied, " Mrs. Surratt." He Avas then asked by the officer, Morgan, what he came
</p>
<p>at that time of night for ? to which he replied, " to dig a gutter in the morning ;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Surratt had sent for him." ' Afterwards he said, " Mrs. Surratt knew he was
</p>
<p>a poor man, and came to him "
</p>
<p>Being asked where he worked, he replied, " sometimes on I street;" and where
</p>
<p>he boarded, he replied, "he had no boarding-house, and was a poor man who got
</p>
<p>his living with the pick, " which he bore upon his shoulder, having stolen it from
</p>
<p>the intrenchments of the capital. Upon being pressed again why he came there
</p>
<p>at that time of night to go to work, he answered that he simply called to see what
</p>
<p>time he should go to work in the morning. Upon being told by the officer, who
</p>
<p>fortunately had preceded him to this house, that he would have to go to the Pro

</p>
<p>asked to Step into the hall and state whether she knew this man. Raising her
</p>
<p>right hand she exclaimed, "Before God, sir, I have not seen that man before; I
</p>
<p>have not hired him ; I do not know anything about him." The hall was brilliantly
</p>
<p>lighted. If not one word had been said, the mere act of Payne in flying to her house for
</p>
<p>shelter would have borne witness against her strong as proofs from Holy Writ. But
</p>
<p>when she denies, after hearing his declaratrons that she had sent for him, or that
</p>
<p>she had gone to him and hired him, and calls her God to witness that she had
</p>
<p>never seen him, and knew nothing of Kim, when, in point of fact, -she had seen
</p>
<p>him for four successive days in her own house, in the same clothing which he then
</p>
<p>wore, Who can resist for a moment the conclusion that these parties were alike
</p>
<p>guilty ? ,
</p>
<p>The testimony of Spangler's complicity is conclusive and brief. It was impossi
</p>
<p>ble to hope for escape after assassinating the President, and such others as might
</p>
<p>attend him in'Ford's Theatre, without arrangements being first made to aid the
</p>
<p>flight of the assassin, and to some extent prevent the immediate pursuit.
</p>
<p>A stable was to be provided close to Ford's Theatre, in which the horses could
</p>
<p>be concealed and kept ready for the assassin's nse whenever the murderous blow
</p>
<p>was struck. Accordingly, Booth secretly, through Maddox, hired a stable in rear
</p>
<p>of the theatre and connecting with it by an alley, as early as the 1st of January
</p>
<p>last; showing that at that time he had concluded, notwithstanding all that has
</p>
<p>been said to the contrary, to murder the President in Ford's Theatre and provide
</p>
<p>the means for immediate and successful flight. Conscious of his guilt he paid the
</p>
<p>rent for this stable, through Maddox, month by month, giving him the money. He
</p>
<p>employed Spangler, doubtless for the reason that he could trust him with the se
</p>
<p>cret, as a carpenter to fit up this shed, so that it would furnish room for two horses
</p>
<p>and provided the door with lock and key. Spangler did this work for him. Thou
</p>
<p>it was necessary that a carpenter, having access to the theatre, should be employed
</p>
<p>by the assassin to provide a bar for the outer door of the passage leading to the
</p>
<p>President's box, so that When he entered upon his work Of assassination, ha would
</p>
<p>be secure from interruption from the rear.
</p>
<p>By the evidence, it is shown that Spangler was in the box, in which the Presi
</p>
<p>dent was murdered, on the afternoon of the 14th of April, and when there damned
</p>
<p>the President and General Grant, and said the President ought to be cursed, he had
</p>
<p>got so many good mon killed ; showing not only his hostility to the President, bat

</p>
<p>the cause of it, that he had been faithful to his oath and had resisted that great
</p>
<p>rebellion in the interest of which his life was about to be sacrificed by his co-con
</p>
<p>spirators. In performing the work which had doubtless been intrusted to him by-
</p>
<p>Booth, a mortice was cut in tho wall. A wooden bar was prepared, onp end of
</p>
<p>which could be readily inserted in the mortice and the other pressed against the
</p>
<p>edge of the door on the inside so as to prevent its being opened. Spangler had
</p>
<p>the skill and opportunity to do that work and all the additional work that was tobs
</p>
<p>done. It is in evidence that the screws in "tho keepers " to the locks on each of the
</p>
<p>inner doors of the the box occupied by the President were drawn. Thp attempt
</p>
<p>has been made, on behalf of the prisoner, to show that this was done some .time
</p>
<p>before, accidentally, and with no had design, and had not been repaired by reason
</p>
<p>of inadvertence; but the attempt has utterly failed, because the testimony adduced
</p>
<p>for that purpose relates exclusively to but ono of the two inner doors, while tho
</p>
<p>fact is, that the screws were drawn in both, and the additional precaution taken to
</p>
<p>cut* small hole through one of these doors through whioh the party approaching
</p>
<p>and while in the private passage would be enabled tp look into the box and exam
</p>
<p>ine the exact posture of the President before entering. It was also deemed essen
</p>
<p>tial, in the execution of this plot, that some one should watch at the outer door, in
</p>
<p>the rear of the theatre, by which alono the assassin could hope for escape. It was
</p>
<p>for this wprk Booth sought to employ Chester in January, offering $3,000 down
</p>
<p>of the inpney of his employers, and the assurance that he should never want.
</p>
<p>What Chester refused, Spangler undertook and promised to do. When Booth
</p>
<p>TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS. 341
</p>
<p>brought his horse to the rear door of the theatre, on the evening of the murder, he
</p>
<p>called for Spangler, who went to him, when Booth- was heard to say to him, " Ned,,
</p>
<p>you'll help me all you can, won't you." To which Spangler replied, " Oh, yes."
</p>
<p>when Booth made his escape, it is testified by Col; Stewart, who pursued him
</p>
<p>across the stage and out through the same door, that as he approached it some one
</p>
<p>slammed it shut. Ritterspaugh, who was standing behind the scenes when Booth
</p>
<p>fired the pistol and fled, saw Booth run down the passage toward the back door,
</p>
<p>and pursued him ; but Booth drew his knife npon him and passed out, slamming
</p>
<p>the door after him. Ritterspaugh opened it and went through, leaving it open
</p>
<p>behind him, leaving. Spangler inside, and a position from which he readily could
</p>
<p>have reached the door. Ritterspaugh also States, that very quickly after he had
</p>
<p>passed through this door he was followed by a large man, the first who followed
</p>
<p>him, and who was, doubtless, Colonel Stewart. Stewart is- very positive that he
</p>
<p>saw this door slammed; that he himself was constrained to open it, and had some
</p>
<p>difficulty in opening it.
</p>
<p>He also testifies that as he approached the door a man stood near enough to have
</p>
<p>thrown it to with his hand, and this man, the witness bolieves; was the prisoner
</p>
<p>Spangler. Ritterspaugh has sworn that ho left the door open behind him when ha
</p>
<p>went out, and that he was followed by the large man, Colonel Stewart. Who
</p>
<p>slammed that door behind Ritterspaugh ? It was not Ritterspaugh ; it could not
</p>
<p>have been Booth, for Ritterspaugh swears that Booth was mounting his horse at
</p>
<p>the time, and Stewart swears that Booth was upon his horse when he came out.
</p>
<p>That it was .-pangler who slammed the door after Ritterspaugh m ty not only bo
</p>
<p>inferred from Stewart's testimony, but it is made very clear by his own conduct af
</p>
<p>terward upon the return of Ritterspaugh to tho stage. The; door being then open,
</p>
<p>and Ritterspaugh being asked which way Booth went, had answered. Ritterspaugh
</p>
<p>says: "Then I came back on the stage, where I had left Edward Spangler: he
</p>
<p>hit me on the face with his hand, and said, 'Don't say which way he went.' I
</p>
<p>asked him what he meant by slapping me in the mouth ? He said, ' For God's sake,
</p>
<p>shut up.' "
</p>
<p>The testimony of Withers is adroitly handled to throw doubt upon these facts.
</p>
<p>It can not avail, for Withers says he was knocked' in the scene by Booth, and when
</p>
<p>he " come to " he got a side view of him. A man knocked down and senseless, on
</p>
<p>"coming to" might mistake anybody by a side view, for Booth.

<p>An attempt has been made by the defense to discredit this testimony of Rit-
</p>
<p>terepiugh, by shjwiag his contradictory statements to Gifford, Carlan, and Lamb,
</p>
<p>neither of whom do in fact contradict him, but substantially sustain him. None
</p>
<p>but a guilty man would have met the witness with a blow for stating which way
</p>
<p>the assassin had gone. A like confe33ion of guilt was made by Spangler when
</p>
<p>the Wituess; Miles, the same evening, and directly after the assassination, came
</p>
<p>to the back door, where Spangler was standing with- others, and asked Spaug--
</p>
<p>ler who it was that held the horse, to which Spangler replied :  " Hush ; don't
</p>
<p>say anything about it." He confessed his guilt again whan he denied to Mary
</p>
<p>Anderson the faet, proved here beyond alt question, that Booth had called him
</p>
<p>when he came to that door with his horse, using the emphatic words, " No, he
</p>
<p>did not ; he did not call me."
</p>
<p>The rope come3 tp bear witness agaiust him, as did the rope which Atzeroth
</p>
<p>and Harold and John H. Surratt had carried to Surrattsville and deposited there
</p>
<p>with the carbines.
</p>
<p>It is only surprising that the ingenious counsel did not attempt to explain the
</p>
<p>deposit of the rope at Surrattsville by the same method that he adopted: in ex

<p>planation of the deposit of this rope, some sixty feet long, found iii the carpet-

<p>sack of Spangler. unaccounted for, save by some evidence which tends to show-
</p>
<p>that he may hive carriei it away from the theater.
</p>
<p>It is not needful to take time in the recapitulation of the evidence; which
</p>
<p>shows conclusively that David E. Harold was one of these conspirators. His
</p>
<p>continued association with Booth, with Atzeroth, his visits to Mrc. Surratfs,.his
</p>
<p>attendance at the theater with Payne, Surratt, and Atzeroth, his connection with

<p>342 TRIAL OF THE ASSASSINS.
</p>
<p>rection of and near to the theater at the hour appointed for the work of assas
</p>
<p>sination, and his final flight and arrest, show that he, in common with all tho
</p>
<p>other parties on trial, and all the parties named upon yonr record not npon
</p>
<p>trial, had combined and confederated to kill and murder in the interests of the
</p>
<p>rebellion, as charged and specified against them.
</p>
<p>That this conspiracy wa3 entered into by all these parties, both present and
</p>
<p>absent, is thus proved by the acts, meeetiugs, declarations, and correspondence
</p>
<p>of all the parties, beyond any doubt whatever. True, it is circumstantial evi
</p>
<p>dence, but the Court will remember the rule before recited that circumstances
</p>
<p>can not lie ; that they are held sufficient in every court where justice is judi
</p>
<p>ciously administered to establish the fact of a conspiracy.
</p>
<p>I shall take no further notice of the remark made by the learned counsel who
</p>
<p>opened for the defense, and which has been followed by several of his associ
</p>
<p>ates, that, under the Constitution, it requires two witnesses to prove tr <) overt
</p>
<p>act of high treason, than to say, this is not a charge of high treason, f ut of a
</p>
<p>treasonable conspiracy, in aid of a rebellion, with intent to kill and murder the
</p>
<p>Executive officer of the United States, and commander of its armies, aud of the
</p>
<p>murder of the President in pursuance of that conspiracy, and with the intent
</p>
<p>laid, &o. Neither by the Constitution, nor by the rules of the common law, is
</p>
<p>any fact connected with this allegation required to be established by the testi
</p>
<p>mony of more than one witness. I might say, however, tbat every substantive
</p>
<p>averment against each of the parties named upon this record has been estab
</p>
<p>lished by the testimony of more than one witness.
</p>
<p>That the several accused did enter into this conspiracy with John Wilkes
</p>
<p>Booth and John H. Surratt to murder the officers of this Government, named
</p>
<p>upon the record, in pursuance of the wishes of their employers and instigators
</p>
<p>in Richmond and Canada, and with intent thereby to aid tho existing rebellion,
</p>
<p>and subvert the Constitution and laws of the United States, as alleged, is no
</p>
<p>longer an open question.
</p>
<p>The intent as said, was expressly declared by Sanders in the meeting of the
</p>

</p>
<p>The learned gentleman (Mr. Johnson) says the Government has .'urvived the
</p>
<p>assassination of the President, and thereby would have you infer thfitthis con
</p>
<p>spiracy was not entered into and attempted to be executed with the intent laid
</p>
<p>With as much show of reason it might be said that because the Government of
</p>
<p>the United States has survived this unmatched rebellion, it therefore results
</p>
<p>that the rebel conspirators waged war upon the Government vith no purpose
</p>
<p>or intent thereby to subvert it. By the law we have seen that without any di
</p>
<p>rect evidence of_ previous combination and agreement between these parties,
</p>
<p>the conspiracy might be established by evidence of the acts of the prisoners, or
</p>
<p>of any others with whom they co-operated, concurring in the execution of the
</p>
<p>common design. (Roscoe, 416.)
</p>
<p>Was there eo-operation between the several accused in the execution of this
</p>
<p>conspiracy ? That there was is as clearly established by the testimony as is
</p>
<p>the fact that Abraham Lincoln was killed and murdered by John Wilke3 Booth.
</p>
<p>The evidence shows that all of the accused, save Mudd and Arnold, were in
</p>
<p>Washington on the 14th of April, the day of the assassination, together with
</p>
<p>John Wilkes Booth and John H. Surratt ; that on that day Booth had a secret
</p>
<p>interview with the prisoner, Mary E. Surratt ; that immediately thereafter she
</p>
<p>went to Surrattsville to perform her part of the preparation necessary to the
</p>
<p>successful execution of the conspiracy, and did make that preparation ; that
</p>
<p>John H. Surratt had arrived here from Canada, notifying the parties that the
</p>
<p>price to be paid for this great crime had been provided for, at least in part, by
</p>
<p>the deposit receipts of April 6, for $180,000, procured by Thompson, of the

</p>
<p>strike a blow, and ready for the contemplated flight ; that Atzeroth on the after
</p>
<p>noon of that day, was seeking to obtain a horse, the better to secure his own
</p>
<p>safety by flight after he should have performed the task whioh he had volun
</p>
<p>tarily undertaken by contract, in the conspiracy  the murder of Andrew John
</p>
<p>son, then Vice-President of th3 United States ; that he did procure a horse for
</p>
<p>that purpese at Naylor's, and was seen, about nine o'clock in the evening, to
</p>
<p>ride to the Kirkwood House where the Vice-President then was, dismount and
</p>
<p>enter. At a previous hour Booth was in the Kirkwood House ; and left his card, now
</p>
<p>in evidence, doubtless intended to be sent to the room of the Vice-President,
</p>
<p>and was in these words : " Don't wish to disturb you. Are you at home ? J.
</p>
<p>Wilkes Booth." Atzeroth, when he made application at Brooks' in the after
</p>
<p>noon for the horse, said to Weichman, who was there, he was going to ride in
</p>
<p>the country, and that ' he was going to get a horse and send for Payne." He
</p>
<p>did get a horse for Payne, as well as for himself ; for it is proven that on the
</p>
<p>12th he was seen in Washington, riding the horse which had been procured by
</p>
<p>Booth, in company with Mudd, last November, from Gardner. A similar horse
</p>
<p>was tied before the door of Mr. Seward on the night of the murder, was cap
</p>
<p>tured after the flight of Payne, who was seeu to ride away, and which horse is
</p>
<p>now identified as the Gardner horse. Booth also procured a horse on the same
</p>
<p>day, took it to his stable in the rear of the theater, where he had an interview
</p>
<p>with Spangler, and where he concealed it. Harold, too, obtained a horse in
</p>
<p>the afternoon, and was seen between nine and ten o'clock, riding with Atze
</p>
<p>roth down the Avenue from the Treasury, then up Fourteenth and down F
</p>
<p>street, passing close by Ford's Theater.
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin had come to Washington the day before, had sought out his vic
</p>
<p>tim (General Grant) at the house of the Secretary of War, that he might be able
</p>
<p>with certainty to identify him, and at the very hour when these preparations
</p>
<p>were going on. was lying in wait at Ruilman's, on the Avenue, keeping watch,
</p>
<p>and declaring, as he did at about ten o'clock P. M., when told that the fatal
</p>
<p>blow had been struck by Booth, " I don't believe Booth did it." During the
</p>
<p>day, and the night before, he had been visiting Booth, and doubtless encourag
</p>
<p>ing him, and at that very hour was in position, at a convenient distance, " to
</p>
<p>aid and protect him in his flight, as well as to execute his own part of the con
</p>

<p>theater, nor in the city, having left the city that day. Who doubts that Booth,
</p>
<p>having ascertained in the course of the day that General Grant could not be
</p>
<p>present at the theater. O'Laughlin, who was to murder General Grant, instead
</p>
<p>of entering the box with Booth, was detailed to lie in wait, and watch and sup
</p>
<p>port him.
</p>
<p>His declarations of his reasons for changing his lodgings here and in Balti
</p>
<p>more, after the murder, so ably, and so ingeniously presented in the argument
</p>
<p>of his learned counsel (Mr. Cox), avail nothing before the blasting fact, that he
</p>
<p>did change his lodgings, and declared "he knew nothing of the affair whatever."
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin, who lurked here, conspiring daily with Booth and Arnold for six
</p>
<p>weeks to do this murder, declares " he knew nothing of the affair." O'Laughlin,
</p>
<p>who says he was " in the oil business," which Booth, and Surratt, and Payne,
</p>
<p>and Arnold, have all declared meant this conspiracy, says " he knew nothing of
</p>
<p>the affair." O'Laughlin, to whom Booth sent the despatches of the 13th and
</p>
<p>27th of March ; O'Laughlin, who is named in Arnold's letter as one of the con
</p>
<p>spirators, and who searched for General Grant on Thursday night, laid in wait
</p>
<p>for him on Friday, was defeated by that Providence " which shapes our ends,"
</p>
<p>and laid in wait to aid Booth and Payne, declares " he knew nothing of the mat
</p>
<p>ter." Such a denial is as false and inexcusable as Peter's denial of our Lord.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Surratt had arrived at home from the completion of her part of the plot,
</p>
<p>about half-past eight o'clock in the evening. A few moments afterwards she
</p>
<p>was called to the parlor, and there had a private interview with some one un
</p>
<p>seen but whose retreating footsteps were beard by the witness Weichman. This
</p>
<p>was doubtless the secret and last visit of John H. Surratt to his mother, who 
</p>
<p>844: TRIAL OF THE ASSASSINS.
</p>
<p>had instigated and encouraged him to Btrike this traitorous and jnnrderonB
</p>
<p>blow against his country.
</p>
<p>While these preparations were going on, Dr. Mudd was awaiting, the execu
</p>
<p>tion of the plot; ready faithfully to perform bis part in securing tbe safe escape
</p>
<p>of the murderer. Arnold was at his post at Fortress Monroe, awaiting the
</p>
<p>meeting referred to in his letter of March 27th, wherein he says they were not
</p>
<p>to; " meet for a month or so," which month had more than expired on the day
</p>
<p>of the murder, for the letter and the testimony disclose that this month of sus
</p>
<p>pension began to run from about the first week in March.
</p>
<p>He stood ready with the arms which Booth had furnished him to aid the es
</p>
<p>cape of the murderers by tbat route, and secure their communication with tffeir
</p>
<p>employers. He had given the assurance in that letter to Booth, that, although
</p>
<p>the Government " suspicioned them" and the undertaking was " becoming
</p>
<p>complicated," yet " a time more propitious would arrive" for the consumma
</p>
<p>tion of this conspiracy, in which he " was one" with Booth, and then he would
</p>
<p>" be better prepared to again be with him."
</p>
<p>Such were the preparations. The horses were in readiness for the flight ; the
</p>
<p>ropes were procured, doubtless for the purpose of tying the horses at whatever
</p>
<p>point they might be constrained to delay and secure their boats to their moor
</p>
<p>ings in making their way across the Potomac. The five murderous camp-
</p>
<p>knives, the two carbines, the eight revolvers, the Derringer, in Court, and iden
</p>
<p>tified, all were ready for the work of death. The part that each had played
</p>
<p>has already been in part stated in this argument, and needs no repetition.
</p>
<p>Booth proceeded to the theater about nine o'clock in the evening, at the same
</p>
<p>time that Atzeroth, and Payne, and Harold were riding the streets, while Sur
</p>
<p>ratt, having parted with his mother at the brief interview in her parlor, from
</p>
<p>which his retreating steps were heard, was walking the Avenue, booted and
</p>
<p>spurred, and doubtless consulting with O'Laughlin. When Booth reached the
</p>
<p>rear of the theatre, he called Spangler to him (whose denial of that fact, when
</p>
<p>charged with it, as proven by three witnesses, is very significant), and received
</p>
<p>from Spangler his pledge to help him all he could, when with Booth he entered
</p>
<p>the theater by the stage door, doubtless to see that the way was clear from the
</p>
<p>box to the rear door of the theater, and look upon their victim, whose exact
</p>
<p>position they could study from the stage. After this view Booth passes to the

<p>street, in front of the theater, where on the pavement, with other conspirators
</p>
<p>yet unknown*  among them one described as a low-browed villain  he awaits
</p>
<p>the appointed moment. Booth himself, impatient, enters the vestibule of the
</p>
<p>theater from the front, and asks the time. He is referred to the clock, and re
</p>
<p>turns. Presently, as the hour of ten o'clock approached, one of his guilty asso
</p>
<p>ciates called the time ; they wait ; again, as the moments elapsed, this conspira
</p>
<p>tor on watch called the time ; again, as the appointed hour draws nigh, he calls
</p>
<p>the time ; and finally, when the fatal moment arrives, he repeats in a louder
</p>
<p>tone, "Ten minutes past ten o'clock." Ten minutes past ten o'clock! The
</p>
<p>hour has come when the red right hand of these murderous conspirators should
</p>
<p>Btrike, and the dreadful deed of assassination be done.
</p>
<p>Booth, at the appointed moment, entered the theater,' ascended to the dress-
</p>
<p>circle, passed to the right, paused a moment, looking down, doubtless to see if
</p>
<p>Spangler was at his post, and approached the outer door of the close passage
</p>
<p>leading to the box occupied by the President ; pressed it open, passed in, and
</p>
<p>closed the passage door behind him. Spangler's bar was in its place, and was
</p>
<p>readily adjusted by Booth in the mortice, and pressed against the inner side of
</p>
<p>the door, so that he was secure from interruption from without. He passes on
</p>
<p>to the next door, immediately behind the President, and there stopping, looks
</p>
<p>through the aperture in the door into the President's box, and deliberately ob
</p>
<p>serves the precise position of his victim, seated in the chair which had been pre
</p>
<p>pared by the conspirators as the altar for the sacrifice, looking calmly and qui
</p>
<p>etly down upon the glad and grateful people, whom, by his fidelity, he had
</p>
<p>saved from peril which had threatened the destruction of their Government, and
</p>
<p>all they held dear this side of the grave, and whom he had come upon invitation

</p>
<p>to greet with his presence, with the words still lingering, upon bis lips which he
</p>
<p>had uttered with uncovered head and uplifted hand before God and his coun
</p>
<p>try, wben on the 4th oflast March, he took again the oath to preserve, protect,
</p>
<p>and defend the Constitution, declaring that he entered upon the duties of his
</p>
<p>great office, " with malice toward none, with charity for all." In a moment
</p>
<p>more, strengthened by the knowledge that his co-conspirators were all at their
</p>
<p>posts, seven at least of them present in the citv, two of them, Mudd and Ar
</p>
<p>nold, at their appointed places, watching for his coming, this hired assassin

</p>
<p>Treason has done his worst ; nor steel, nor poison,

</p>
<p>At the same hour, when these accused and their co-conspirators in Richmond

<p>which deprived the Republic of its defender, and filled this land from ocean to

<p>Atzeroth, near midnight, returns to the stable of Naylor the horse which he had
</p>
<p>procured for this work of murder, having been interrupted in the execution of the
</p>
<p>part assigned him at the Kirkwood House by the timely coming of citizens to the
</p>
<p>defence of the Vice-President, and creeps into the Pensylvania House at 2 o'clock
</p>
<p>in the morning with another of the conspirators, yet unknown. There he re
</p>
<p>mained until & o'clock, when he left, found his way to Georgetown, pawned one
</p>
<p>of his revolvers, now in Court, and fled northward into Maryland.
</p>
<p>He is traced to Montgomery county, to the house of Mr. Metz, on the Sunday
</p>
<p>succeeding the murder, where, as is proved by the testimony of three witnesses, he
</p>
<p>said that if the man that was to follow General Grant had followed him, it was
</p>
<p>likely that Grant was shot. To one of these witnesses (Mr. Laynian) he said he
</p>
<p>did not think Grant had been killed ; or if he had been killed hewas killed by a
</p>
<p>man who got on the cars at the same time that Grant did ; thus disclosing most
</p>
<p>clearly that one of his co-conspirators was assigned the task of killing and murder
</p>
<p>ing General Grant; and that Atzeroth knew that General Grant had left the city
</p>
<p>of Washington, a fact which is not disputed, onthe Eriday evening of the murder,-.
</p>
<p>by the evening train. Thus this intended victim of the conspiracy escaped* for
</p>
<p>that night, thp knives and revolvers of Atzerothj and O'Laughlin, and Payne, and:
</p>
<p>Harold, and Booth, and John H. Surratt, and, perchance, Harper and Caldwell,
</p>
<p>and twenty others who were then here lying in wait for his life.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, Booth and Harold, taking the route before agreed upon, make
</p>
<p>directly after the assassination for the Anaoostia bridge. Booth crosses first, gives
</p>
<p>his name, passesthe guard, and is speedily followed by Haroldr They make their
</p>
<p>way directly to Surrattsville, where Harold calls to Lloyd, "Bring out those
</p>
<p>346 TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS.
</p>
<p>things," showing that there had been communication between them and Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt after her return. Both the carbines being in readiness, according to Mary
</p>
<p>E. Surratt's directions, both were brought out. They took but one ; Booth de
</p>
<p>clined to carry the other, saying, that his limb was broken. They then declared
</p>
<p>that they had murdered the President and the Secretary of State. They then
</p>
<p>made their way directly to the house of the prisoner Mudd, assured of safety and
</p>
<p>security. They arrived early in the morning before day, and no man knows "at
</p>
<p>what hour they left. Harold rode towards' Bryantown with Mudd about three
</p>
<p>o'clock that afternoon, in the vicinity of which place he parted with him, remain
</p>
<p>ing in the swamp, and was afterward seen returning the same afternoon in the di
</p>
<p>rection of Mudd's house ; about which time, a Uttle before sundown, Mudd re- '
</p>
<p>turned from Bryantown towards his home.
</p>
<p>This village at the time Mudd was in it was thronged with soldiers in pursuit of
</p>
<p>the murderers of the President, and although jreat care has been taken by the de
</p>
<p>fence to deny that any one said in the presence of Dr. Mudd, either there or else
</p>
<p>where on that day, who had committed the crime, yet it is in evidence by two
</p>
<p>witnesses whose truthfulness no man questions, that upon Mudd's return to his
</p>
<p>own house, that afternoon, he stated that Booth was the murderer of the Presi
</p>
<p>dent, and Boyle the murderer of Secretary Seward, but took care to make the
</p>
<p>further remark, that Booth had brothers, and he did not know which of them had
</p>
<p>done the act. When did Dr. Mudd learn that Booth had brothers ? And what
</p>
<p>is still more pertinent to this inquiry, from whom did he learn that either John
</p>
<p>Wilkes Booth or any of his brothers had murdered the President? It is clear that
</p>
<p>Booth remained in his house until some time in the afternoon of Saturday ; that
</p>
<p>Harold left the house alone, as one of the witnesses states, being seen to pass the
</p>
<p>window ; that he alone of these two assassins was in the company of Dr. Mudd on
</p>
<p>his way to Bryantown. It does not appear when Harold returned to Mudd's
</p>
<p>house. It is a confession of Dr. Mudd himself, proven by one of the witnesses,
</p>
<p>that Booth left his house on crutches, and went in the direction of the swamp.
</p>
<p>How long he remained there, and what became of the horses which Booth and
</p>
<p>Harold rode to his house, and which were put into his stable, are facts nowhere
</p>
<p>disclosed by the evidence. The owners testify that they have never seen the horses
</p>
<p>since. The accused give no explanation of the matter, and when Harold and
</p>
<p>Booth were captured they had not these horses in their possession. How comes it

</p>
<p>that on Mudd's return from Bryantown, on the evening of Saturday, in his conver
</p>
<p>sation with Mr. Hardy and Mr. Farrell, the witnesses before referred to, he gave
</p>
<p>the name of Booth as the murderer of the President and that of Boyle as the mur
</p>
<p>derer of Secretary Seward and his son, and carefully avoided intimating to either
</p>
<p>that Booth had come to his house early that day and had remained there until the
</p>
<p>afternoon; that he left him in his house and had furnished, him with a razor with
</p>
<p>which Booth attempted to disguise himself by shaving off his moustache ? How
</p>
<p>comes it, also, that, upon being asked by those two witnesses whether the Booth
</p>
<p>who killed the President was the one who had been there last fall, he answered
</p>
<p>that he did not know whether it was that man or one of his brothers, but he under
</p>
<p>stood he had some brothers, and added, that if it was the Booth who was there
</p>
<p>last fall, he knew that one, but concealed the fact that this man had been at his
</p>
<p>house on that day and was then at his house, and had attempted, in his presence,
</p>
<p>to disguise his person ?
</p>
<p>He was sorry, very sorry, that the thing had occurred, but not so sorry as to be
</p>
<p>willing to give any edvidence to these two neighbors, who were manifestly honest
</p>
<p>and upright men, that the murderer had been harbored in his house all day, and
</p>
<p>was probably at that moment, as his own subsequent confession shows, lying con
</p>
<p>cealed in his house or near by, subject to his call. This is the man who undertakes
</p>
<p>to show by his own declaration, offered in evidence against my protest, of what he
</p>
<p>said afterward, on Sunday afternoon, the 16th, to his kinsman, Dr. George D. Mudd
</p>
<p>to whom he then stated that the assassination of the President was a most damn
</p>
<p>able act, a conclusion in which most men will agree with him, and to establish
</p>
<p>which his testimony was not needed. But it is to be remarked that this accused
</p>
<p>TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS. 347
</p>
<p>did not intimate that the man whom he knew the evening before was the mur
</p>
<p>derer had found refuge in his house, had disguised his person, and sought conceal
</p>
<p>ment in the swamp upon the crutches which he had provided for him.
</p>
<p>Why did he conceal this fact from his kinsman ? After the church sen-ices were
</p>
<p>over, however, in another conversation on their way home, he did tell Dr. George
</p>
<p>Mudd that two suspicious persons had been at his house, who had come there a
</p>
<p>Uttle before daybreak on Saturday morning ; that one of them had a broken leg,
</p>
<p>which he bandaged ; that they seemed to be laboring under more excitement than
</p>
<p>probably would result from the injury; that they got something to eat at his
</p>
<p>house ; that they said they came from Bryantown, and inquired the way to Parson
</p>
<p>Wilmer's ; that while at his house one of them called for a razor and shaved
</p>
<p>himself. The witness says : " I do not remember whether he said that this party
</p>
<p>shaved off his whiskers or moustache, hut he altered somewhat or probably materi
</p>
<p>ally his features. " Finally, the prisoner, Dr. Mudd, told this witness that he, in
</p>
<p>company with the younger of the two men went down the road toward Bryantown
</p>
<p>in search of a vehicle to take the wounded man away from his house.
</p>
<p>How comes it that he concealed in his conversation the fact proved that he went
</p>
<p>with Harold towards Bryantown, and left Harold outside of the town ? How
</p>
<p>comes it that in this second conversation, on Sunday, insisted upon here with such
</p>
<p>pertinacity as evidence for the defence, but which had never been called for by the
</p>
<p>prosecution, he concealed from his kinsman the fact which he had disclosed the
</p>
<p>day before to Hardy and Farrcll, that it was Booth who assassinated the President,
</p>
<p>and the fact which is now disclosed by his other confessions given in evidence for
</p>
<p>the prosecution, that it was Booth whom he had sheltered, concealed in his house,
</p>

</p>
<p>further statement, however, to this witness, that on Sunday evening ho requested
</p>
<p>the witness to state to the military authorities that two suspicious persons had been
</p>
<p>at his house, and see if anything could be made of it. He did not tell the witness
</p>
<p>what became of Harold and where he parted with him on the way to Bryantown.
</p>
<p>How comes it that when he was in Bryantown, on the Saturday evening before,
</p>
<p>when he knew that Booth was then at his house, and that Booth was the murderei
</p>
<p>of the President, he did not himself state it to the military authorities then in that
</p>
<p>village, as he well knew ? It is difficult to see what kindled his suspicions on Sun
</p>
<p>day, if none were in his mind on Saturday, when he was in possession of the fact

<p>that Booth had murdered the President, and was then secreting and disguising
</p>
<p>himself in the prisoner's own house.
</p>
<p>His conversation with Gardner on the same Sunday at the church is also intro
</p>
<p>duced here, to relieve him from the overwhelming evidences of his guilt. He
</p>
<p>communicates nothing to Gardner of the fact that Booth had been in his house ;
</p>
<p>nothing of the fact that he knew the day before that Booth had murdered the
</p>
<p>President ; nothing of the fact that Booth had disguised or attempted to disguise
</p>
<p>himself; nothing of the fact that he had gone with Booth's associate, Harold, in
</p>
<p>search of a vehicle, the more speedUy to expedite their flight ; nothing of the fact that
</p>
<p>Booth had found concealment in the woods and swamp near his house, upon the
</p>
<p>crutches which he had furnished him. He contents himself with merely stating
</p>
<p>"that we ought to raise immediately a home guard to hunt up all suspicious per
</p>
<p>sons passing through our section of country, and arrest them, for there were two
</p>
<p>suspicious persons at my house yesterday morning."
</p>
<p>It would have looked more like aiding justice and arresting felons if he had put
</p>
<p>in execution his project of a home guard on Saturday, and made it effective by
</p>
<p>the arrest of the man then in his house who had lodged with him last fall ; with
</p>
<p>whom he had gone to purchase one of the very horses employed in his flight af
</p>
<p>ter the assassination ; whom he had visited last winter in Washington, and to
</p>
<p>whom he had pointed out the very route by which he had escaped by way of his
</p>
<p>house ; whom he had again visited on the 3d of last March, preparatory to the
</p>
<p>commission of this great crime ; and who he knew, when he sheltered and con
</p>
<p>cealed him in the woods on Saturday, was not merely a suspicious person, but was,
</p>
<p>in fact, the murderer and assassin of Abraham Lincoln. While I deem it my duty
</p>
<p>3$8r TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS.
</p>
<p>to say here, as I said before, when these declarations, uttered by the accused on
</p>
<p>Sunday, the 16th,: to Gardner and George D. Mudd, were attempted to be; offered
</p>
<p>on the part of the accused, that' they are in no sense evidence, and by the law
</p>
<p>were wholly inadmissible, yet I state it as my conviction, that, being upon the re
</p>
<p>cord upon motion of the accused : himself, so far as these declarations to Gardner
</p>
<p>and George D. Mudd go, they are additional indications of the guilt of the accused,
</p>
<p>in this, that they are manifestly suppressions of truth and suggestions of falsehood
</p>
<p>and deception ; they are but tho utterances and confessions of guilt.
</p>
<p>To Lieutenant Lovett, Joshua Lloyd and Simon Gavican, who, in the pursuit of
</p>
<p>the murderer, visited his house on the 18th of April; the Tuesday after the mur
</p>
<p>der, he denied positively, upon inquiry, that two men had passed his house, or find
</p>
<p>come to his house on the morning after the assassination. Two of these witnesses
</p>
<p>swear positively to his having made the denial and the other says he hesitated to
</p>
<p>answer the question he put to him ; all of them agree that heafterwards admitted
</p>
<p>that two men had been there; one of whom had a broken limb, which he had set ;
</p>
<p>and when asked by this witness who that man was, he said he did not know ; that
</p>
<p>the man was a stranger to him, and that the two had been there but a short time.
</p>
<p>Lloyd asked him if he had ever seen any of the parties, Booth, . Harold and Sur
</p>
<p>ratt; he said that he had never seen them, while it is positively proved that he was
</p>
<p>acquainted with John H. Surratt; who had been in his house ; that he knew Booth,
</p>
<p>and had introduced Booth to Sutfratt last winter. Afterwards, on Friday, the 21st,
</p>
<p>he admitted to Lloyd that he had been introduced to Booth last fall, and that this
</p>
<p>man who came to his house on Saturday, the 15th, remained there from about four
</p>
<p>o'clock in the morning until about four in the afternoon ; that one of them left his
</p>
<p>house on horseback, and the other walking. In the first conversation he denied
</p>
<p>ever having seen these men.
</p>
<p>Colonel Wells also testifies that, in his conversation with Dr. Mudd on Friday,
</p>
<p>the 21st, the prisoner said that he had gone to Bryantown, or near Bryantown, to
</p>
<p>6ee some friends on Saturday, and that as he came back to his own house he saw
</p>
<p>the person he afterwards supposed- to be Harold passing to the left of his house to
</p>
<p>wards the barn, but that he did not see the other person at all after he left him in
</p>
<p>his own house, about one o'clock. If this statement bo true; how did Dr. Mudd
</p>
<p>see the same person leave his house on crutches ? He further stated to this wit
</p>
<p>ness that he returned to his own house about four o'clock in the afternoon ; that he

</p>
<p>did not know this wounded man ; said he could not recognize him from the pho
</p>
<p>tograph which is of record here, but admitted that he had met Booth some time
</p>
<p>in November, when he had some conversation with him about lands and horses;
</p>
<p>that Booth had remained with him that night in November, and on tho next day
</p>
<p>had purchased a horse. He said he had not again seen Booth from tho tiino of the
</p>
<p>introduction in November up to his arrival at his house on the Saturday morning
</p>
<p>after the assassination. Is not this aconfession that he did see- John Wilkes Booth
</p>
<p>on that morning at his house, and knew it was Booth? If he did not know him,
</p>
<p>how came he to make this statement to the witness " that he had not seen Booth
</p>
<p>after November prior to his arrival there on the Saturday morning ?"
</p>
<p>He had said before to the same witness he did not know the wounded man. He
</p>
<p>said further to Colonel Wells, that when he went up stairs after their arrival, he
</p>
<p>noticed that the person he supposed to be Booth, had shaved off his moustache.
</p>
<p>It is not inferrable from this declaration that he then supposed him to be Booth ?
</p>
<p>Yet he declared the same afternoon, and while Booth was in his own house, that
</p>
<p>Booth was the murderer of the President. One of the most remarkable statements
</p>
<p>made to this witness by the prisoner was that he heard for the first time on Sunday
</p>
<p>morning, or late, in the evening of Saturday, that the President had been murder-
</p>
<p>ed. From whom did he hear it? The witness (Colonel Wells) volunteered his
</p>
<p>" impression " that Dr. iMudd had said he had heard it after the person had left his
</p>
<p>house. If the " impression " of the witness thus volunteered is to be taken as evi
</p>
<p>dence, and the counsel for the accused, judging! from their manner, seem to think
</p>
<p>it ought to be, let this question be answered, how could Dr. Mudd have made that
</p>
<p>impression upon any body truthfully, when it is proved by Farrell and Hardy that
</p>
<p>TRIAL OP THE ASSASSINS. 349
</p>
<p>on his return from Bryantown, on Saturday afternoon, he not only stated that the
</p>
<p>President, Mr. Seward and his son had been assassinated, but that Boyle had as
</p>
<p>sassinated Mr. Seward, and Booth had assassinated the President ? Add to this
</p>
<p>the fact that he said to this witness that ho left his own house at one o'clock, and
</p>
<p>when he returned the men were gone ; yet it is in evidence, by his own declara
</p>
<p>tions, that Booth left his house at four o'clock on crutches, and he must have been
</p>
<p>there to have seen it, or he could not have known the fact.
</p>
<p>Mr. Williams testified that he was at Mudd's house on Tuesday, the 18th of
</p>
<p>April, when he said that strangers had not been that way, and also declared that he
</p>
<p>heard, for the first time, of the assassination of the President on Sunday morning,
</p>
<p>at church ; afterwards, on Friday, the 21st, Mr. Williams asked him concerning
</p>
<p>the men who had been at his house, one of whom had a broken limb, and he con
</p>
<p>fessed they had been there. Upon being asked if they were Booth and Harold, he
</p>
<p>said they were not; that he knew Booth. I think it is fair to conclude that he did
</p>
<p>know Booth, when we consider the testimony of Weichman, of Norton, of Evans,
</p>
<p>and all the testimony jnst referred to, wherein he declares, himself, that he not
</p>
<p>only knew him, but that he had lodged with him, and that he had himself gone%
</p>
<p>with him when he purchased his horse from Gardener last fall, for the very pur
</p>
<p>pose of aiding the flight of himself or, some of his confederates.
</p>
<p>All these circumstances taken together, which, as we have seen upon high au
</p>
<p>thority, are stronger as evidence of guilt than even- direct testimony, leave no
</p>
<p>further room for argument, and no rational doubt that Doctor Samuel A. Mudd
</p>
<p>was as certainly in this conspiracy as were Booth and Harold, whom be sheltered
</p>
<p>and entertained ; receiving them under cover of darkness on the morning after the
</p>
<p>assassination, concealin them throughout that day from the hand of offrnded justice
</p>
<p>and aiding them by every endeavor, to pursue their way successfully to their co-con
</p>
<p>spirator, Arnold, at Fortress Monroe, and in which direction he fled until over
</p>
<p>taken and slain.
</p>
<p>We next find Harold and his confederate, Booth, after their departure from
</p>
<p>the house of Mudd, across the Potomac, in the neighborhood of Port Conway, on
</p>
<p>Monday the 24th of April, conveyed in a wagon. There Harold, in order to ob
</p>
<p>tain the aid of Capt. Jett, Buggies and Bainbridge, of the confederate army, said
</p>
<p>to Jett, "We are the assassinators of the President ; " that this was his brother
</p>
<p>with him, who, with himself, belonged to A. P. Hill's Corps ; that his brother had

</p>
<p>been wounded at Petersburg ; that their names were Boyd. He requested Jett
</p>
<p>and his rebel companions to take them out of the lines. After this, Booth joined
</p>
<p>these parties, was placed on Ruggles' horse, and crossed the Rappahannock river.
</p>
<p>They then proceeded to- the house of Garrett, in the neighborhood of Port Roy
</p>
<p>al, and nearly midway between Washington City and Fortress Monroe, where
</p>
<p>they were to have joined Arnold. Before these 'Rebel guides and guards parted
</p>
<p>with them, Harold confessed that they were traveling under assumed names ; that
</p>
<p>his own name was Harold, and that the name of the wounded man was John
</p>
<p>Wilkes Booth, "who had killed the President." The Rebels left Booth at Gar
</p>
<p>rett's where Harold revisited him from time to time, until they were -captured. At
</p>
<p>two o'clock on Wednesday morning, the 26th, a party of United States officers and
</p>
<p>soldiers surrounded Garrett's barn, -Where Booth and Harold lay concealed, and de
</p>
<p>manded their surrender. Booth cursed Harold, caRijng him a coward, and hade
</p>
<p>him go, when Harold came out and surrendered himself, was taken into custody,
</p>
<p>and is now brought into Court. The barn -was then set on fire, when Booth
</p>
<p>sprang to his feet, amid the flames that were kindling about him, carbine in hand,
</p>
<p>and approached the door, seeking, by the flashing light of the fire, to find some
</p>
<p>new victim for his murderous hand, when he was shot^ as he deserved to be, by
</p>
<p>Sergeant Corbett^ in order tcsave his comrades from -wounds or death by the haiids
</p>
<p>of this desperate assassin. Upon his person was found the following bill of ex-

</p>
<p>Thus fell, by the hands of one of the defenders of the Republic, this hired assas
</p>
<p>sin, who, for a price, murdered Abraham Lincoln, bearing upon his person, as this
</p>
<p>hill of exchange testifies, additional evidence of the fact that he had undertaken,
</p>
<p>in aid of rebellion, this work of assination by the hands of himself and his confede
</p>
<p>rates, for such sum as the accredited agents of Jefferson Davis might pay him or
</p>
<p>them, out of the funds of the Confederacy, which, as in evidence, they had in
</p>
<p>"any amount" in Canada for the purpose of rewarding conspirators, spies, poison
</p>
<p>ers and assassins, who might take service under their false commissions, and do
</p>
<p>the work of the incendiary and the murderer upon the lawful representatives of the
</p>
<p>American people, to whom had been entrusted the care of the Repubhc, the main
</p>
<p>tenance of the Constitution and the execution of the laws.
</p>
<p>The Court will remember that it is in the testimony of Merritt, and Montgome
</p>
<p>ry, and Conover, that Thompson, and Sanders, and Clay, and Cleary, made their
</p>
<p>boasts that they had money in Canada for this very purpose. Nor is it to be over
</p>
<p>looked or forgotten that the officers of the Ontario Bank at Montreal testify that
</p>
<p>" during the current year of this conspiracy and assassination Jacob Thompson had
</p>
<p>on deposit in that bank the sum of six hundred and forty-nine thousand dollars,
</p>
<p>and that these deposits to the credit of Jacob Thompson, accrued from the nego
</p>
<p>tiations of bills of exchange drawn by the Secretary ot the Treasury of the so-called
</p>
<p>Confederate States on Fraser, Trenholm & Co. , of Liverpool, who were known to
</p>
<p>be the financial agents of the Confederate States. With an undrawn deposit in
</p>
<p>this bank of four hundred and fifty-five dollars, which has remained to his credit
</p>
<p>since October last, and with an unpaid bill of exchange drawn by the same bank
</p>
<p>upon London, in his possession and found upon his person, Booth ends his guilty
</p>
<p>career in this work of conspiracy and blood in April, 1865, as he began it in Octo
</p>
<p>ber, 1864, in combination with Jefferson Davis, Jacob Thompson, George N. San
</p>
<p>ders, Clement C. Clay, William C. Cleary, Beverly Tucker and other co-conspira
</p>
<p>tors, making use of the money of the Rebel Confederation to aid in the execution
</p>
<p>and in the flight, bearing at tho moment of his death upon his person their money,
</p>
<p>part of the price which they paid for his great crime, to aid him in its consumma
</p>
<p>tion, and secure him afterwards from arrest and the just penalty which by the law
</p>
<p>of God and the law of man is denounced against treasonable conspiracy and murder.

<p>By all the testimony in the case, it is, in my judgment, made as clear as any
</p>
<p>transaction can be shown by human testimony, that John Wilkes Booth and
</p>
<p>John H. Surratt, and the several accused, David E. Harold, George A. Atzeroth,
</p>
<p>Lewis Payne, Michael O'Loughlin, Edward Spangler, Samuel Arnold, Mary E.
</p>
<p>Surratt, and Samuel A. Mudd, did, with the intent to aid the existing rebellion
</p>
<p>and to subvert the Constitution and laws of the United States, in the month of
</p>
<p>October last, and thereafter, combine, confederate and conspire with Jefferson
</p>
<p>Davis, George N. Sanders, Beverly Tucker, Jacob Thompson, William C. Cleary,
</p>
<p>Clement C. Clay, George Harper, George Young, and others unknown, to kill
</p>
<p>and murder, within the military department of Washington, and within the in
</p>
<p>trenched fortifications and military lines thereof, Abraham Lincoln, then Presi
</p>
<p>dent of the United States, and Commander-in-Chief of the army and navy there
</p>
<p>of ; Andrew Johnson, Vice-President of the United States, William H. Seward,
</p>
<p>Secretary of State, and Ulysses S. Grant, Lieutenant-General in command of
</p>
<p>the armies of the United States ; and that Jefferson Davis, the chief of this rebel
</p>
<p>lion, was the instigator and procurer, through his accredited agents ih Canada,
</p>
<p>of the treasonable conspiracy.
</p>
<p>It is also submitted to the Court that it is clearly established by the testimo
</p>
<p>ny that John Wilkes Booth in pursuance of this conspiracy, so entered into by
</p>
<p>him and the accused, did, on the night of the 14th of April, 1865, within the
</p>
<p>military department of Washington, and the intrenched fortifications and mili
</p>
<p>tary lines thereof, and with the intent laid, inflict a mortal wound upon Abra-<
</p>
<p>ham Lincoln, then President and Commander-in-Chief of the army and navy of
</p>
<p>the United States, whereof he died j that in pursuance of the same conspiracy
</p>
<p>TRIAL OF THE ASSASSINS. 351
</p>
<p>and within the said department and intrenched lines, Lewis Payne assaulted,
</p>
<p>with intent to kill and murder, William H. Seward, then Secretary of State of
</p>
<p>the United States ; that Gearge A. Atzeroth , in pursuance of the Same conspir
</p>
<p>acy, and within the said department, laid in wait, with intent to kill and mur
</p>
<p>der Andrew Johnson, then Vice-President of the United States ; that Michael
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin, within said department, and in pursuance of said conspiracy, laid
</p>
<p>in wait to kill and murder Ulysses S. Grant, then in command of the armies of
</p>
<p>the United States ; and that Mary E. Surratt, David E. Harold, Samuel Arnold,
</p>
<p>Samuel A. Mudd, and Edward Spangler, did encourage, aid and abet the com
</p>
<p>mission of said several acts in the prosecution of said conspiracy.
</p>
<p>If this treasonable conspiracy has not been wholly executed ; if the several
</p>
<p>executive officers of the United States and the commander of its armies, to kill
</p>
<p>and murder whom the said several accused thus confederated and conspired,
</p>
<p>have not each and all fallen by the hands of these conspirators, thereby leaving
</p>
<p>the people of the United States without a President, or Vice-President ; without
</p>
<p>a Secretary of State, who alone is clothed with authority by the law to call an
</p>
<p>election to fill the vacancy, should any arise, in the offices of President and
</p>
<p>Vice-President, and without a lawful commander of the armies of the Republic,
</p>
<p>it is only because the conspirators were deterred by the vigilance and fidelity
</p>
<p>of the executive officers, whose lives were mercifully protected on that night of
</p>
<p>murder by the care of the Infinite Being, who has thus far saved the Republic
</p>
<p>and crowned its arms with victory.
</p>
<p>' If this conspiracy was thus entered into by the accused ; if John Wilkes Booth
</p>
<p>dhjkill and murder Abraham Lincoln in pursuance thereof; if Lewis Payne did
</p>
<p>in pursuance of said conspiracy, assault with intent to kill and murder William
</p>
<p>H. Seward, as stated : and if the several parties accused did commit the several
</p>
<p>acts alleged against them in the prosecution of said conspiracy, then it is the
</p>
<p>law that all the parties to that conspiracy, whether present at the time of its ex

<p>ecution or not, whether on trial before this Court or not, are alike guilty of the
</p>
<p>several acts done by each in the execution of the common design. What these
</p>
<p>conspirators did in the execution of this conspiracy by the hand of one of their
</p>
<p>co-conspirators, they did themselves ; his act, done in the prosecution of the

<p>agreement. As we have seen, this is the rule, whether all the conspirators are indicted
</p>
<p>or not ; whether they are all on trial or not. " It is not material what the na
</p>
<p>ture of the indictment is, provided the offence involve a conspiracy. Upon in
</p>
<p>dictment for murder, for instance, if it appears that others, together with the
</p>
<p>prisoner, conspired to perpetrate the crime, the act of one done in pursuance of
</p>
<p>that intention, would be evidence against the rest." (I Whar., 70B.) To the
</p>
<p>same effect are the words of Chief Justice Marshall^ before cited, that whoever
</p>
<p>leagued iu a general conspiracy, performed any part, however minute, or how
</p>
<p>ever remote from the scene of action, are guilty as principals. In this treason
</p>
<p>able conspiracy, to aid the existing armed rebellion, by murdering the execu
</p>
<p>tive officers of the United States and the commander of its armies, all the par
</p>
<p>ties to it must be held as principals, and the act of one, in prosecution of the
</p>
<p>common design, the act of all.
</p>
<p>I leave the decision of this dread issue with the Court, to which alone it be
</p>
<p>longs. It is for you to say, upon your oaths, whether the accused are guilty.
</p>
<p>I am not conscious that in this argumentlhave made any erroneous statement

<p>of the evidence, or drawn any erroneous conclusions ; yetl pray the Court, out
</p>
<p>of tender regard and jealous care for the right of the accused, to see that no

<p>error of mine, if any there be, shall work them harm. The past services of the
</p>
<p>members of this honorable Court give assurance that, without fear, favor, or

<p>affection, they will discharge with fidelity the duty enjoined upon them by
</p>
<p>their oaths. Whatever else may befall, I trust in God that in this, as in every

<p>Thus ended the career of one of the noblest of earth. His name in all

<p>furnish a bulwark behind which the friends of freedom can forever dwell
</p>
<p>secure. Endeared to the American people by his patriotic devotion to

<p>his country while living, he has, by the hand of the cowardly assassin,
</p>
<p>become doubly sanctified by his untimely death. No one in the long list
</p>
<p>of names in the world's great history, except Jesus, will ever eclipse him.
</p>
<p>Darius, Alexander, Caesar, and Napoleon, were great ; but their greatness
</p>
<p>was not the result of goodness, and will never compare with the mighty

<p>achievements of a Washington, who, by seven long years of gigantic

<p>strife, wrested a continent from the grasp of despots ; or a Lincoln, who

<p>and in justice to mankind has made it forever free.

<p>Anxious as men are to win power, how few of those who win it, do
</p>
<p>not afterwards exclaim with the English king  ' ' uneasy lies the head
</p>
<p>that wears a crown." How few monarchs, and mighty men of the earth
</p>
<p>have slept as sound after their elevation, as they did before ! The solu

<p>ception. Greatness in public life, whether achieved or inherited, i3 a
</p>
<p>dangerous thing.
</p>
<p>To give even a faint idea to the unlettered man of the host of distin
</p>
<p>guished persons who have been murdered while sitting in seats of power ,
</p>
<p>would be difficult  but to convince the mass of mankind, not only of the
</p>
<p>number of such victims, but of the endless plots, conspiracies, and ma
</p>
<p>chinery by which this vast army of the illustrious have been hurried to
</p>
<p>their tombs, would be an utter impossibility. The best historians even,
</p>
<p>do not know, and never have, of but a small part of the number of the
</p>
<p>men and women in high stations who have been foully killed, by slow or
</p>
<p>quick poison, the dagger, the bullet, drowning, starvation, suffocation,
</p>
<p>long imprisonment, confinement in private mad-houses, buried alive, the
</p>
<p>rope, the cord, the bowstring, hurled from precipices, frightened to
</p>
<p>death  and God knows how many hundred other modes by which the
</p>
<p>souls of men have by assassination been forced out of this world with all
</p>
<p>its light, and love, and beauty, into the dark, and drear unknown !
</p>
<p>Among public assassinations, perhaps the two most illustrious are
</p>
<p>Casar and Lincoln, performed by individuals as instruments of deep con.
</p>
<p>spiracies. Among public assassinations performed by State governments  and
</p>
<p>their name is legion  we find Jesus of Nazareth and half a million of his
</p>
<p>disciples the most sacred of all, stretching through the ages, like a vast
</p>
<p>, serpent line, black with all crime, and fringed with murder blood.
</p>
<p>There wag Anne Boleyn, and Lady Jane Gray, and Mary Queen of
</p>
<p>Scots, and Maria Antoinette. There was John of Prague, and Huss, and
</p>
<p>Wickliffe,  Charles the II.  Louis XVI.  and all that line. But tlie great
</p>
<p>roll would consist in secret assassinations. Most of the chief Rulers of
</p>
<p>great empires have been dispatched in secret. Nearly all the emperors
</p>
<p>of the old dynasties of Egypt and Asia and Rome died by the hands of
</p>
<p>assassins. So of Russia and other great states.
</p>
<p>It is a curious fact, however, that so large a number of the victims of
</p>
<p>assassin conspiracy have been good men. Attempts to kill tyrants have
</p>
<p>generally failed they have been safe ; for bad men like tyrants because
</p>
<p>tyrants are their friends, and bad men do not kill them. Tyrants are
</p>
<p>not exposed to murder from good men, because good men are not assas

<p>If anything like a, full record of the annals of assassination should be

<p>written, it would fill a library. We select only a few striking cases, and

<p>they are all political murders.  murders for empire  for power.
</p>
<p>Napoleon Bonaparte had no child by Josephine, his first wife, and for
</p>
<p>this reason he discarded her and married Maria Louisa, an Austrian

</p>
<p>Bourbon Princess  the greatest mistake of his life. By this union,
</p>
<p>a son was born who was proclaimed "king of Rome." "Napo
</p>
<p>leon II". On the fall of his father, and his banishment to St. He
</p>
<p>lena, Austria claimed the custody of this boy ; and he was transferred
</p>
<p>to Vienna, where he was kept as an instrument of State, to be used for
</p>
<p>' political purposes. He was the first legitimate heir to the throne of
</p>
<p>Napoleon if the Bonapartes were again to rule Prance :  and having the
</p>
<p>royal blood of the Austrian House in his veins, he also shared in that
</p>
<p>imperial inheritance ; so he could be kept a tenant at the will of Austria ;
</p>
<p>and he was. He could live as long as needed  he could die in a second
</p>
<p>when necessary  or he could live a lingering death by being made an
</p>
<p>imbecile. The latter was his fate. When Europe sunk back to its re
</p>
<p>pose, and the " Holy Alliance" had settled the map of empires, kingdoms,
</p>
<p>and principalities, and all the ships of state were sailing in clear water,
</p>
<p>the time came to get rid of this heir to the throne of Napoleon, for he
</p>
<p>was no longer needed.
</p>
<p>It then became a question only of how to dispatch him. Austria could
</p>
<p>perpetrate any crime :  but in the case of this young man, who had en-
</p>
<p>. deared himself to all the court, and all his attendants, violence was not
</p>
<p>resorted to ; it was not necessary.
</p>
<p>But he must be got rid of. How 1 They could kill him with luxury 
</p>
<p>murder him with perfumes, as Sultans and other Oriental lovers get rid of
</p>
<p>rejected mistresses. They could not make him drink himself to death,
</p>
<p>and so they invoked other fascinations. Fanny Essler had just enchant
</p>
<p>ed the European world. She was sent for. The king of Rome's doom
</p>
<p>was sealed. He died the death of an Oriental satrap. His bier was a
</p>
<p>toed of roses  a fate worthy of Sardinipalus.
</p>
<p>Thus came this imperial son of the great Napoleon to his doom. But
</p>
<p>his cousin Louis Napoleon avenged his death on the field of Solferino 
</p>
<p>and Austria will yet pay still dearer for her crime. The Napoleon dy
</p>
<p>nasty still lives the Bourbons are dj'ing. The first belong to the present
</p>
<p>at least  the latter to the past.

<p>It is hardly necessary to give any recital of the murder of the young

<p>Assassination prevailed to a dreadful extent during the Middle Ages,

</p>
<p>and even in Rome itself, the capital of Christendom, was lower than it

<p>page. Pope Alexander VI., the father of the infamous Csesar Borgia, re
</p>
<p>sorted to assassination whenever it suited his ambitious purposes ; and
</p>
<p>the record of no barbarian Prince is more horrible and revolting than the
</p>
<p>history of this ambitious and heartless Pontiff.
</p>
<p>But the crimes of his son exceeded, if possible, those of his father in
</p>
<p>then- atrocity, enormity and extent. This chiefest villain of all the ages,
</p>
<p>being the son of a Pope who was supreme lord and sovereign of Rome
</p>
<p>and vicegerant of God Almighty, was clothed with great authority, made
</p>
<p>rich by robbery, and could perpetrate any crime with impunity. He
</p>
<p>was made a cardinal ; the Duchy of Valentino was stolen from its right
</p>
<p>ful owner and given to Borgia who had already inaugurated a series of
</p>
<p>the most frightful crimes ever written in the history of a single indi
</p>
<p>vidual. His ambition was to become king of Italy, which at that time
</p>
<p>would, with the all powerful alliance and sanction of the Church of Rome,
</p>
<p>render the king of Italy the most powerful sovereign of Europe.
</p>
<p>With his eye fixed on such a throne Borgia hesitated at no crime. He
</p>
<p>first plotted and secured the death of several of the richest cardinals and
</p>
<p>noblemen of Rome and thus enriched himself. He then made open war
</p>
<p>upon neighboring princes  defeating their armies in the field, and im
</p>
<p>prisoning and murdering their masters. When he could not get them into
</p>
<p>his hands, he employed their confidential friends and attendants to mur- .
</p>
<p>der them in their castles. But as this could not always be done, he re
</p>
<p>sorted to a final plot by which he could get rid of them ail at once. He
</p>
<p>proposed a convention for agreeing on the terms of a general and perma
</p>
<p>nent pe^ce. The rival princes all met Csesar Borgia at one ofljis cas
</p>
<p>tles at the appointed time, when they were foully assassinated in a few
</p>
<p>moments. His assassinations were endless. His means and instruments
</p>
<p>exceeded in number, forms, and subtleties, all knowledge or comprehen
</p>
<p>sion. He had only to will the death of any person in Italy, or any part of
</p>
<p>Europe, and that man, or woman, or child, died. Poison in wines, in all
</p>
<p>kinds of food, in clothing, in flowers and perfumes, in letters, in pres

<p>358 CONCLUSION'.
</p>
<p>The Difficuly to Southern Members of Congress.  In July, 1863, a
</p>
<p>law was passed by Congress requiring the following oath of " every per
</p>
<p>son elected or appointed to any office of honor or emolument, civil, mili
</p>
<p>tary or naval, or any other department of the public service, except the
</p>
<p>President of the United States," to wit:
</p>
<p>I solemnly swear that I have never voluntarily borne arms against the United
</p>
<p>f tates since I have been a citizen thereof, that I have voluntarily given no aid,
</p>
<p>countenance, counsel or encouragement to persons engaged in armed hostility
</p>
<p>thereto ; that I have neither sought or accepted, nor attempted to exercise the func
</p>
<p>tions of any office whatever under any authority or pretended authority in hostility
</p>
<p>to the United States ; that I have not yielded a voluntary support to any pretended
</p>
<p>government, authority, power or constitution within the United States hostile or
</p>
<p>inimical thereto ; and I do further swear that, to the best of my knowledge and
</p>
<p>ability, I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States, &c.
</p>
<p>This is the oath demanded from the members of the last Congress, and
</p>
<p>which the members of the new Congress will likely be compelled to take.
</p>
<p>In matters concerning ourselves, pur kindred, our dear friends and our.
</p>
<p>neighbors, it is consoling, it is sweet to feel we have in all things done
</p>
<p>right. But how much more the responsibility when milhons of the human
</p>
<p>family have confided in the judgment, and placed in the hands of one
</p>
<p>man the sacred trust of preserving their live's, their liberties and their
</p>
<p>earthly all. Every President has this great boon in his keeping ; it is a
</p>
<p>responsible position, a holy trust ; he, who through wisdom and pure
</p>
<p>motives acts justly to all, will receive the heartfelt gratitude of the pres
</p>
<p>ent and coming generations, and when the evening of life gathers softly
</p>
<p>round his dying bed, how happy to know and feel that he has done all
</p>
<p>things well "Only actions of the just
</p>
<p>Smell sweet in life,
</p>
<p>And blossom in the dust."
</p>
<p>President Johnson has the most difficult task to perform of any Presi
</p>
<p>dent since the origin of the government. He can only succeed by the
</p>
<p>aid of divine providence. The war is over, to be sure, but the discord
</p>
<p>ant political elements remain to be harmonized. In this condition justice
</p>
<p>only will secure harmony. Every side of the reconstruction question ap
</p>
<p>pears to be surrounded with difficulty. On the one side you are met by

</p>
<p>downright injustice, backed by ignorance, and supported by prejudice
</p>
<p>against color. .The treacherous ex-slaveholder could never permit the
</p>
<p>freedman to exercise the right of suffrage. He has not only got this
</p>
<p>feeling himself, but he has imparted it in a great measure to his poor
</p>
<p>white neighbor, whom slavery has degraded and impoverished. This
</p>
<p>then shows the feelings of nearly all the white race living in the'South
</p>
<p>concerning the negroes.
</p>
<p>CONCLUSION. 359
</p>
<p>When the white masters owned them, interest prompted kindness and
</p>
<p>care ; but now, when the negro has his freedom, he is looked upon as
</p>
<p>taking a step iu the direction of rivaling the master in his right to vote.
</p>
<p>The poor white man who is ignorant of nearly everything, except hatred
</p>
<p>to the negro, now sees in him a new rival in political rights.
</p>
<p>Some of these unreasonable and unjust prejudices will have to be
</p>
<p>thrown aside, or new troubles will rise in the future that will prove dis
</p>
<p>astrous to the peace and well being of the South, and the Country. The
</p>
<p>northern people have been votiDg against the negro for over eighty years ;
</p>
<p>of course the slaves were not allowed to vote directly, but indirectly.
</p>
<p>The South, under the three-fifth clause of the Constitution, according to
</p>
<p>the last census, would be entitled to a slave representation of about
</p>
<p>2,400,000 persons, that is, 4,000,000 of blacks have the same legal rep
</p>
<p>resentative strength as if 2,400,000 white citizens were added to its pop
</p>
<p>ulation, the South being entitled to eighty-four representatives, ; eigh
</p>
<p>teen of their number hold their office by virtue of the negro population,
</p>
<p>guaranteed by the three-fifth clause in the Constitution. As we before
</p>
<p>said, the negroes did not vote direclly, but for President and members of
</p>
<p>the lower house of Congress, eighty white votes in the slave States being
</p>
<p>equivalent to one hundred in the free States. Suppose there were no
</p>
<p>blacks in the Southern States, who would agree to a system of political
</p>
<p>juggling that would strip the people of the free States of their manhood
</p>
<p>by counting every eighty southern votes as equivalent to every one
</p>
<p>hundred in the Northern States.
</p>
<p>This is the political coat of mail the Constitution furnished to the slave
</p>
<p>oligarchy for over three-quarters of a century. Feehng more than secure
</p>
<p>in the aforesaid political attitude, they became arrogant and domineering,
</p>
<p>and in the attempt to rid themselves of their connection with free insti
</p>
<p>tutions, lost the twenty per cent, advantage given them by the injustice
</p>
<p>of the Constitution. And now, after four years of devastating war,
</p>
<p>inaugurated by their own ignorance and folly, they come out of the
</p>
<p>bloody contest minus their political superfluities.
</p>
<p>Every citizen of the free States should recollect this, and demaod that

<p>under no pretext will this unjust advantage ever again be acquiesced in,

</p>
<p>into every just and humane principle which, in reaping the fruits of vic

<p>tory, the wise and good adopt as a means to cement the Union and se

<p>cure its perpetuity. The man who pays tax, be he black or white, must
</p>
<p>be allowed the right of suffrage, or his excuse for rebelling against in
</p>
<p>justice is the same as our revolutionary fathers had against Great Britain.
</p>
<p>If the rebel States are left to themselves to reorganize, the leaders of
</p>
<p>the late rebellion will become masters of the field. It is safe to count
</p>
<p>them as eighty in every hundred of the white population. They hate
</p>
<p>every white man that holds Union sentiments, and every negro because
</p>
<p>the Union made him free.
</p>
<p>The reader can now observe some of the difficulties that lie in the way
</p>
<p>of harmonizing the new relations created by the war in the South. The
</p>
<p>disappointed, defeated and disgraced rebels will do all in their power
</p>
<p>to prevent a good feeling between the loyal whites and freedmen of the
</p>
<p>South. There is one way to arrange this troublesome question. Let loyalists,
</p>
<p>black and white, who fought and saved the country by pouring out their
</p>
<p>blood, now act together and keep down treason and crush out the vin
</p>
<p>dictive injustice that takes the place of slavery.
</p>
<p>It is safe to say that one half the vuting population of the South have
</p>
<p>fallen in battle, gone to Mexico or Europe, or become disqualified to vote
</p>
<p>by the proclamation of the President. From what is left take twenty per
</p>
<p>cent, as Loyal, add to them the loyal freedman's vote and you have suffi
</p>
<p>cient to overcome by constitutional means the votes. of the disloyal ene
</p>
<p>mies of the Federal Government. Those at the helm of state must make
</p>
<p>sure' that its friends, not enemies, get control of the reconstructing rebel
</p>
<p>States. Here is one trouble that will arise from not allowing the freed
</p>
<p>men to vote, . The Constitution of the United States bases representation
</p>
<p>on the whole number of free population ; this is as it should be, it is repub
</p>
<p>lican. Suppose the 4,000,000 slaves now made free in the Southern States
</p>
<p>are denied the right to vote for the Government, they poured out their
</p>
<p>blood to save. Then the whites of the South would be allowed by the
</p>
<p>Constitution to use these 4,000,000 of freedmen as a representative basis
</p>
<p>and vote on the strength of their numbers for President and representa

</p>
<p>The slaves being now free, if they are not allowed to vote, either a

<p>few loyal or purjured disloyal whites, or both combined, have the Con

</p>
<p>suffer this after-birth of slavery to be dragged into the new order, to per

</p>
<p>state of things the new order would increase, instead of diminish the po-

<p>CONCLUSION. 361
</p>
<p>litical power of the white population. Under the slave system they sent
</p>
<p>eighteen members to Congress by virtue of the three-fifth clause. Now
</p>
<p>that all the slaves must soon become free, 1,600,000 over the three-fifths
</p>
<p>will have to be added to the basis of federal representation ; instead of
</p>
<p>eighteen white men holding seats in Congress as representatives of the
</p>
<p>slave population we have to add ten more by virtue of the slaves all becom
</p>
<p>ing free ; then twenty-eight members of Congress would be entitled to
</p>
<p>seats in the House of Representatives by virtue of the freedmen. If
</p>
<p>they are not allowed to vote, the strength of their numbers is added to
</p>
<p>the white population ; and the new order of things where the South had
</p>
<p>only eighty-four representatives, now gives them ninety-four. If the
</p>
<p>freedmen of the South are allowed to vote, then the Constitution has ful
</p>
<p>filled its promise ; that is to see that the form of government in each
</p>
<p>State is republican ; each vote given in the South will have the same
</p>
<p>power as each vote cast in the North.
</p>
<p>If this course is not adopted, all the political power kept from the negro
</p>
<p>on account qf his color is gained by the Southern white. An unjust law
</p>
<p>may deny the freedmen a right to vote ; but Southern politicians can not do
</p>
<p>without counting them as a basis of representation, they will be eager to
</p>
<p>transfer into the new condition, the dregs of the old, in order to hold
</p>
<p>an increased political power by virtue of the new status of the negro.
</p>
<p>Either the negro must be allowed to vote, or the white man must be de
</p>
<p>nied the right to vote for him ; to do the latter, the Constitution will have
</p>
<p>to be changed, and the principle of basing representation on the whole
</p>
<p>number of free persons discarded.
</p>
<p>To abandon this, we remove the very foundation of free government.
</p>
<p>Are the people of the United States prepared for this, because it is distasteful
</p>
<p>to the ex-slaveholders and a few political demagogues to allow the negro the
</p>
<p>right of suffrage ? The South itself would loose political power if this
</p>
<p>was carried out : instead of ninety-four representatives she is enti
</p>
<p>tled to by counting the negro population, she would if they were left
</p>
<p>out, be entitled to only sixty-six. Thus we see, however distasteful
</p>
<p>negro voting may be, self interest will compel them to grant their
</p>
<p>just political rights. The people of this great country will never

<p>362 CONCLUSION.
</p>
<p>would use the ingratitude of the Federal Government as an argument with
</p>
<p>the negro , and by promising him his political rights, under different circum
</p>
<p>stances, might at some future day, with his assistance make another effort
</p>
<p>to achieve their independence. The Southern States are not allowed to
</p>
<p>go on under their old constitutions, but are compelled to make new ones ;
</p>
<p>they must be republican in form, recognizing the abolition of slavery.
</p>
<p>But we ask how can a constitution be republican in the true seDse and
</p>
<p>meaning of the term if it denies- the right to vote to a majority of its citi
</p>
<p>zens. Such are the constitutions of South Carolina and Mississippi, where
</p>
<p>the freedmen outnumber the white population ; would this be republican
</p>
<p>in form ? we think not. But counting freedmen as a basis of representa
</p>
<p>tion, you give to the South Carolina and Mississippi rebels more political
</p>
<p>power than they had when slavery was in full blast. But if you reduce
</p>
<p>the voting population to the loyal whites, the whole thing becomes a
</p>
<p>farce. The political power exercised by the very few loyal whites, would
</p>
<p>excel any thing before known. Such a preponderous and unjust grant of
</p>
<p>pohtical power in voting, and reconstructing the organic laws of the rebel
</p>
<p>States can not be allowed  the people of the North will not permit it to be
</p>
<p>done. If the freedmen of the South are to be counted as a basis of rep
</p>
<p>resentation, where is the political knave in the North that will go before
</p>
<p>the country and advocate the right of rebels to vote for them ; no, the
</p>
<p>freedmen must be counted out, or allowed to do their own voting. That
</p>
<p>they can not be counted out without destroying the fundamental princi
</p>
<p>ples of the Federal Government we have before shown. This question
</p>
<p>now comes' before the nation in the same form as emancipation. By it
</p>
<p>the. Government secured the aid of the slave, and the sympathetic prayers
</p>
<p>of all Christian countries rose in our behalf like incense to the throne oi
</p>
<p>God, and in his own good time Jehovah smiled, and our success was
</p>
<p>complete. The power of the Federal Government is now so imposing that it can,
</p>
<p>without-fear, afford to be just. As to the question what to do with the
</p>
<p>negro, we can say the Saviour of men answered this question over 1800
</p>
<p>years ago  " Do even unto them as you would wish them in all things
</p>
<p>to do unto you." The peace and future safety of our country can only

<p>be preserved by directing our political course more in harmony with

</p>
<p>Hon. Michael Hahn:
</p>
<p>My Dear Sir : I congratulate you on having fixed your name in histo
</p>
<p>ry as the first free-State Governor of Louisiana. Now you are about to
</p>
<p>have a convention, which, among other things, will probably define the
</p>
<p>elective franchise. I barely suggest, for your private consideration,
</p>
<p>whether some of the colored people may not be let in, as, for instance,
</p>
<p>the very intelligent, and especially those who have fought gallantly in
</p>
<p>our ranks. They would probably help, in some trying time to come, to
</p>
<p>keep the jewel of liberty in the family of freedom. But this is only a
</p>
<p>suggestion, not to the public, but to you alone.
</p>
<p>Truly yours, A. LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>ANOTHER IMPORTANT LETTER.
</p>
<p>The following extract is from the late President Lincoln's letter to Gen.
</p>
<p>Wadsworth, who fell in the battle of the Wilderness.
</p>
<p>It shows that Mr. Lincoln desired the bestowal of the elective franchise
</p>
<p>upon the blacks, and was, also, at an early day, in favor of granting uni
</p>
<p>versal amnesty to the South.
</p>
<p>His wishes, in this particular, the American people can not afford to
</p>
<p>disregard. Congress should exact the right of suffrage for the blacks,
</p>
<p>then universal amnesty should be extended to the rebels. This certainly
</p>
<p>was Mr. Lincoln's plan, and whose intentions all parties should observe.
</p>
<p>The following is the extract referred to, in which Mr. Lincoln says :
</p>
<p>" You desire to know, in the event of complete success in the field 
</p>
<p>the same being followed by a loyal and cheerful submission on the part
</p>
<p>of the South  if universal amnesty should not be accompanied with uni
</p>
<p>versal suffrage.
</p>
<p>" Now, since you know my private inclinations as to what terms should
</p>
<p>be granted to the South, in the contingency mentioned, I will here add,
</p>
<p>that if our success should thus be realized, followed- by suGh desired re
</p>
<p>sults, I can not see, if universal amnesty is granted, how, under the cir
</p>
<p>cumstances, I can avoid exacting in return universal suffrage, or, suf
</p>
<p>frage on the basis of intelligence and military service.

<p>" How to better the condition of the colored race has long been a study

<p>which has attracted my serious and careful attention ; hence I think I am

<p>clear and decided as to what course I shall pursue in the premises, regard

<p>flag they have so fearlessly defended."
</p>
<p>President Johnson is determined to make the passage of the constitu
</p>
<p>tional amendment abolishing slavery, and the repudiation of all debts
</p>
<p>contracted in aid or by authority of the rebellion prominent features
</p>
<p>in his administration. Although slavery received its death wound by the
</p>
<p>Proclamation of Freedom, yet it requires the amendment to complete its
</p>
<p>legal extinction on American soil.
</p>
<p>We know not what may be in store for the black race in America ;
</p>
<p>but let the people so act that hereafter it can never be said that their
</p>
<p>personal freedom, or a fair competition in the race for life, were denied
</p>
<p>them. Give them fair play; they and their friends ask no more, and
</p>
<p>will accept no less.
</p>
<p>Then, whatever may be their future history, America will have done
</p>
<p>her duty;
</p>
<p>Washington gave us Independance ; Lincoln will ever stand in his
</p>
<p>tory as the liberator of the American slave. The extension of the right
</p>
<p>of suffrage to the Freedmen will form another important epoch in our
</p>
<p>country's history. By securing this right, President Johnson becomes
</p>
<p>the founder of equal and impartial justice to all American citizens.
</p>
<p>This wise measure will give full scope to his honest and patriotic
</p>
<p>heart, and forever fix his name in history as the worthy successor of the
</p>
<p>lamented Lincoln.
</p>
<p>We have thus passed over the road which the nation has traveled from
</p>
<p>its birth beginning with the adoption of the Federal Constitution, where
</p>
<p>we find the origin not only of all our prosperity, but of all our domestic
</p>
<p>troubles. We have traced the growth of the slave power, which under
</p>
<p>the shield of that Constitution, ruled the republic exclusively for slavery
</p>
<p>until slavery was overthrown ; and we have shown how imperative it was
</p>
<p>that slavery and the slave power should die, in order that liberty and
</p>
<p>the republic might live. We have developed the secret plots and con
</p>
<p>spiracies of the champions of human bondage, who, like despots every
</p>
<p>where, to achieve success, resorted to the foulest crimes. And we have,

<p>LETTER FROM PROFESSOR ROBERT GRANT,
</p>
<p>Who accompanied Comodore Perry's Squadron at the close of the Mexican war.
</p>
<p>and at his direction made a Scientific investigation of the Climate, Soil, and Pro
</p>
<p>ducts of Central America. Baltimore, Oct. 23d, 1865.
</p>
<p>Dear Sm,
</p>
<p>I congratulate you upon the success of your work, entitled History qf the Plots
</p>
<p>and Grimes qfthe Great Conspiracy to Overthrow Liberty in America, showing the
</p>
<p>barbaric animus which actuated those Southern conspirators, who inaugurated the
</p>
<p>great American rebellion in favor of Monarchy, based upon the indiscriminate sla
</p>
<p>very of the labor of the country.
</p>
<p>My purpose in writing to you, at this time, is, to offer my positive evidence, in
</p>
<p>corroboration of the facts you have established in your work, showing that Presi
</p>
<p>dents Harrison and Taylor were poisoned by those demons in human form, who
</p>
<p>inoculated and " fired the southern heart," with their traitorous teachings.
</p>
<p>It so occurred, in the conducting of my business, as a mechanical engineer, that
</p>
<p>I became a temporary resident in Washington, at the time of President Harrison's
</p>
<p>death, and also at the moment of President Taylors death. At the time of Presi
</p>
<p>dent Harrison's death, I was consulted in reference to the use of galvanism, in the
</p>
<p>last stages of his disease, inasmuch as I had made some improvements in electro-
</p>
<p>magneto machines adapted to medical uses, and as it had been suggested by some
</p>
<p>medical gentlemen, that electro-chemical baths, would be serviceable in eliminating
</p>
<p>poisons from the human system in extreme cases.
</p>
<p>The baths were not used, as far as I know, by the medical gentlemen having the
</p>
<p>immediate case of the President, but I do know that the symptoms were ad
</p>
<p>mitted by several medical attendants on that occasion at the White House, to re
</p>
<p>quire the most energetic treatment for poison. I recollect perfectly well that a
</p>
<p>diagnosis of the case was advanced, referring the symptoms to the presence of lead,
</p>
<p>in some form, either as an oxide or an acetate, as accounting for the peculiar
</p>
<p>character of the disease which resulted in the death of President Harrison.
</p>
<p>The subsequent poisoning of President Taylor, and the attempt to poison Presi
</p>
<p>dent Buchanan fatally, has satisfied me that lead, either in the whole or mingled
</p>
<p>with arsenic, was the immediate means of these cold blooded assassinations.
</p>
<p>Referring to the suggestions of medical .gentlemen in Washington in making a
</p>
<p>diagnosis of the case of President Harrison, and referring the symptoms to the
</p>
<p>presence of poison, I feel it to be necessary to state, that these explanations were
</p>
<p>advanced with extreme caution. Honorable gentlemen were adverse to counte

<p>nance an expression of public conviction, which would degrade our national char
</p>
<p>acter, and stigmatize us as a race of poisoners, more atrocious and cruel than the
</p>
<p>political banditti who hovered like a fiendish incubus over the darkest night of
</p>
<p>crushed Italy. The hydra body of slavery had not, at that time, fully developed
</p>
<p>its gnashing jaws, and philanthropists were only intent on nipping off, and rubbing
</p>
<p>down with gentle etnolients the crop of hissing heads, which were budding out all
</p>
<p>over its hideous carcass. Therefore it was, that peace-loving men hushed with
</p>
<p>trembling fear, any public expression of this horrid conviction.
</p>
<p>The poisoning of President Taylor, the particulars of which I am personally con
</p>
<p>versant with, so far as an immediate investigation of the symptoms are concerned,
</p>
<p>was doubtless effected by " the same kind of drug as was given to President Harri
</p>
<p>son" as you correctly state in your work. The principal physicians who attended
</p>
<p>President Harrison, were those who attended President Taylor. The result was

<p>PROP. ROBERT GRANT'S LETTER.
</p>
<p>On the 4th of July 1850, President Taylor attended the inauguration of the
</p>
<p>Washington Monument, and after sitting out the speeches and ceremonies of the
</p>
<p>occasion, returned to the White House between 4 and 5 o'clock, p. m. One of the
</p>
<p>attendants of the White House stated to me at that time, " that immediately after
</p>
<p>arriving home, President Taylor partook of a dish of cold boiled cabbage, of which
</p>
<p>he was very fond. Soon after he was taken with severe vomiting, which continued
</p>
<p>until his death." The matter thrown from President Taylor's stomach, as did that in
</p>
<p>the case of President Harrison, showed every appearance of poison, according to the
</p>
<p>best concurring evidence which I could obtain on the spot at the time of his death.
</p>
<p>Was a secret assassin near the person of President Taylor during, these terrible

<p>four days, manipulating him according to the southern programme, so successfully

<p>As the priests of the Indian Thuggs have their sworn assassins ; as the Italian

<p>from the vivid sense and knowledge I possess, that these men have committed
</p>
<p>crimes so satanically wicked that no language, but that constructed to represent the
</p>
<p>syampathies of hell, can give tongue to the terrible reality!
</p>
<p>I do not desire to elaborate this subject, and I can not explain systematically a
</p>
<p>tithe of what I know, affirming the correctness of your book, without dilating upon
</p>
<p>the question to the exclusion of more pressing business. One incident, however, I
</p>
<p>shall go so far as to describe, which may, perhaps, throw some light upon the
</p>
<p>machinations of one of the principal characters in this drama, and which has not
</p>
<p>hitherto been made public.
</p>
<p>In the spring of 1848, I was in Washington on official business, having but re
</p>
<p>cently returned from the Gulf of Mexico, where I had been attached to Commo
</p>
<p>dore Perry's squadron, during the latter part of the Mexican war. While under
</p>
<p>Commodore Perry's command, I had, by his direction, made a scries of scientific
</p>
<p>explorations, in various parts of the peninsula of Yucatan, and through the Usuma-
</p>
<p>centi river, in Central America. The results of my labors were recorded in the
</p>
<p>form of a report, accompanied with illustrative maps, drawings, and various speci
</p>
<p>mens, both animal and mineral, representing the productions of the country.
</p>
<p>When I arrived in Washington, I was given to understand that this report had
</p>
<p>been ordered in accordance with the desire of- Hon. John C. Calhoun, and I was
</p>
<p>directed to attend at his house with it in F Street. I paid my respects to Mr. Cal
</p>
<p>houn, and at his request deposited a copy of my report with Mr. Burt, Mr. Cal
</p>
<p>houn's son-in-law, for perusal. This incident occurred on or about the 15th of
</p>
<p>June 1818. In a few days after Hon. Mr. Burt called upon me and invited me
</p>
<p>PROF. ROBERT GRANT'S LETTER.
</p>
<p>to take tea with Mr. Calhoun at his house. On my arrival I soon discovered that
</p>
<p>this social family " tea" was most emphatically a -'plant," or in other words, through
</p>
<p>the magic influence of this aristocratic southern family teaparty I wa3 expected lo
</p>
<p>be impressed with the propriety of altering my report, or of allowing Hon. John C.
</p>
<p>Calhoun to alter it so as to convert its purely scientific record into arguments advo
</p>
<p>cating the introduction of slavery into the valley of the Usumacenti river and Cen
</p>
<p>tral America. 
</p>
<p>I did not beheve in slavery ; I never could endorse it in any shape ; ana I frankly
</p>
<p>told Mr. Calhoun so; although I at the same time admitted that I believed, as I do
</p>
<p>now, most emphatically, that the negro race are not of the genus homo with the
</p>
<p>white man, and that, as a race, in a state of slavery, he is the worst enemy the
</p>
<p>white man has to encounter on earth, as he invariably barbarizes the white man
</p>
<p>when associated with him in this condition, by a process indosmos and ezosmos of
</p>
<p>mentalities, and physically by the nursing of the .vhite man's child by the negro
</p>
<p>" mama's" as practiced at the South  the negro nutrition controling the natural
</p>
<p>idiocyncracies of the white child  the normal condition of the negro being barbaric '
</p>
<p>and wild, to which condition he will immediately revert, when freed from the in
</p>
<p>fluence of the white man, and that every attempt to associate the dark races with
</p>
<p>the white races, since the earliest dawn of monumental history, has hitherto re
</p>
<p>sulted and inevitably will result in the debasement of both races  and that no white
</p>
<p>race has fallen or gone down in the scale of civilization, except through the futile
</p>
<p>attempt to engraft some dark race upon its progressive life  and that the great
</p>
<p>error of the South was the attempt to innoculate its civilized progress with the negro
</p>
<p>element, as a permanent basis of enslaved labor  and that, if this course was con
</p>
<p>tinued, it would result in the ruin of the South, or the destruction of the negro.
</p>
<p>This idea I had also elaborated in my report, which had been previously examined
</p>
<p>by Mr. Calhoun.
</p>
<p>All that I said on that occasion appeared to have no effect upon Mr. Calhoun ;
</p>
<p>he listened for the moment and incidentally remarked that my antecedent record was
</p>
<p>a sufficient guarantee for my final action in this matter ; and went on to propose
</p>
<p>that I should omit that portion of my report, showing the incompatibility of the
</p>
<p>negro with civilization, and that the whole should be made to show the vast ad
</p>
<p>vantage which would result from the immediate introduction of negro slavery into
</p>
<p>those fertile valleys which drain the eastern water-shed of the mountains in Central
</p>
<p>America. The result of our conversation was, that I gleaned from Mr. Calhoun

</p>
<p>the substance of his intentions, to finally press slavery into all the grain-growing
</p>
<p>States and Territories of the North, for the purpose of affording breeding grounds,
</p>
<p>or a kind of Africa, producing slaves for the more fertile cotton and sugar planting
</p>
<p>regions south, until the pressure, north and south, should have absorbed the entire
</p>
<p>continents of North and South America in^an immense slaveholding nation.
</p>
<p>Mr. Calhoun unreservedly presented this vision to me because I had, as he re
</p>
<p>marked, referring to my antecedents two years previously, with his knowledge and
</p>
<p>approbation, given a series of public lectures in New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore
</p>
<p>and Washington, showing the marked distinction between the dark and white
</p>
<p>races, and proving the incompatibility of the dark races of mankind with a high
</p>
<p>state of human progress, in common with the wild Fauna and Flora of the inferior
</p>
<p>types; and which lectures, the events of this war have crowned almost with the
</p>
<p>fight of history. Mr. Calhoun doubtless was impressed with the belief, as I find
</p>
<p>most persons now are, on the first presentation of my theory, "that the transition
</p>
<p>from this doctrine to a coincidence with slavery, was but a step. True, it is but a
</p>
<p>step  but that step is from the sublime to the ridiculous ! ! The simple fact is,
</p>
<p>that whatever the negro may be, God made him so, for his own good purpose, and
</p>
<p>no man has a right to make a slave of him ! If he does so, the negro carries his
</p>
<p>own vengeance with him into that slavery, which, by association, eventually bar
</p>
<p>barizes the white man.
</p>
<p>In view of such inducements, as the final carrying out of this great slave nation
</p>
<p>ality might offer, Mr. Calhoun gave me to understand, as a present consideration,
</p>
<p>if I would lend my report to the interest of slavery, that the whole should be pub-
</p>
<p>lished as a Congressional Document, that I should be paid the extraordinary ex
</p>
<p>penses which I had been subjected to, in making explorations and collecting speci
</p>
<p>mens, and in compiling my report. That I should be continued in my position in
</p>
<p>the navy, at an increased salary, that I should he detailed to make scientific ex
</p>
<p>plorations among the wild races of Africa, which I then anxiously desired to ac
</p>
<p>complish. At the same time, Mr. Calhoun gave me to understand, that "if I did
</p>
<p>not so prostitute my report to the interest of slavery, that I should not be paid a
</p>
<p>cent for my trouble in getting it up. That I would lose my situation in the navy,
</p>
<p>with all the flattering inducements held out to me, and that I should be debarred
</p>
<p>hereafter from all Government countenance and support in my efforts to introduce
</p>
<p>the Calcium light for light-house purposes.
</p>
<p>This was the substance of Mr. Calhoun's conference with me. It was not direct
</p>
<p>ly, or plainly stated by him in the aggregate, but he left me te draw inferences as
</p>
<p>to the result of my action, in reference to the report; still I could not mistake his
</p>
<p>meaning. He was very gen lemanly in his manner, and his conversational and
</p>
<p>persuasive powers were of the highest order; at the same time there was a lordly,
</p>
<p>dogmatic air, which he used, seeming to desire to compel me to accept the fiat of
</p>
<p>his will. With all this, my pride was finally roused. My Scotch nature would
</p>
<p>not submit to be made the tool of an imperious aristocrat. The insult, of being re
</p>
<p>quested to sell my highest convictions, for a mess of pottage, was more than I had
</p>
<p>bargained for; and without deigning further explanation, i flatly refused his offer,
</p>
<p>and taking up my manuscript, remarked, that it ' ' was already paid for ; that it
</p>
<p>was worth to me all that it cost, and that I intended to keep it until such times, as
</p>
<p>with God's blessing mankind should come to their senses, which event, I hoped and
</p>
<p>believed, would occur in my day, if not in his. " (Now, thank God ! in my day
</p>
<p>mankind are coming to their senses.) I then retired from the presence of the
</p>
<p>great autocrat, and I have never seen him since ; but I have felt him. Shortly after
</p>
<p>I was informed that my services were no longer required in the navy. I was re
</p>
<p>fused all compensation for my report, and during Mr. Calhoun's life I could do
</p>
<p>nothing witli my light-house improvements ; and even after his death the shadow
</p>
<p>of that unrelen:ing old man stood in my path in a hundred different forms, until
</p>
<p>the breaking out of the rebellion. I have now, however, reason to believe that his
</p>
<p>ghost is laid, and forever, with his great prototype, the Satanic spirit of slavery !
</p>
<p>I am glad, my dear sir, that you have unmasked the fiendish origin, and mon
</p>
<p>archical tendencies of human bondage.
