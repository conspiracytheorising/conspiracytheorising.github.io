</p>
<p>descriptions of a condition of country and of Indian life now passed awa}"^ nre

<p>OPINIONS
</p>
<p>OF
</p>
<p>PROMINENT PAPERS AND CRITICS ON PARKMAN'S WRITINGS.
</p>
<p>Mr. Parkman's descriptions of Indian life are unsurpassed by anything of the kind.
</p>
<p>Boston Advertiser.
</p>
<p>His place is alongside of (he greatest historians whose works are English classics.
</p>
<p>London Athenmtm.
</p>
<p>In vigor and pointedness of description, Mr. Parkman may be counted superior to Irving.
</p>
<p>New York Tribune.
</p>
<p>What magic hides itself in the brain and pen of Mr. Parkman, that lie makes this rugged
</p>
<p>and ragged growth of the French occupancy of Canada so pregnant with life and interest to
</p>
<p>the reader? It ('Count Fiontenac and ISew France under Louis XIV.") reads like
</p>
<p>romance, hut romance of a high order.  Providence Press.
</p>
<p>There is not a single voliwie that does not read like a novel, and every one of the histories
</p>
<p>is the highest autiiority on the subject of which it treats.  The Nation.
</p>
<p>3Ir. Parkman's deep sympathy with his subject is the secret of his success as a narrator.
</p>
<p>Each actor in the scene is his friend or foe ; he has taken musty records, skeletons of facts,
</p>
<p>dry bones of barest history, and breathed on them that they might live.  The Spectator.
</p>
<p>A subject which Mr. Parkman has made as much his own as Motley the Dutch Republic,
</p>
<p>or Macaulay the English Revolution. It is to the pages of Mr. Parkman that we must go
</p>
<p>for the American Indian.  -George William Curtis.
</p>
<p>In interest this work (" Pioneers of France ") exceeds any aovet which has been published
</p>
<p>during the year,  Boston Transcript.
</p>
<p>Js fascinating as any of Scott^s novels.  Boston Pilot.
</p>
<p>Mr. Parkman's sketches of lake and forest scenery, in the glory of summer or in the
</p>
<p>gloom of winter, are of exquisite beauty.  J. Baring Gould.
</p>
<p>The events of the final struggle of France and England for the control of North America
</p>
<p>could not have found an historian more fitted for his task,  Saturday Revieic.
</p>
<p>Easily the first of living American liistorians. More interesting pages we have never read.
</p>
<p>Christian Advocate.
</p>
<p>It is only now that we find ourselves in possession of an authentic, full, sustained, and
</p>
<p>worthy narrative (" Montcalm and Wolfe ") of these momentous events and extraordinary
</p>
<p>men.  Macmillan^s Magazine.
</p>
<p>Mr. Francis Parkman excels, in the qualities of an historian, all Americans who have writ-
</p>
<p>ten history, and all authors tvho have written American history.  New York Methodist.

<p>"The Conspiracy of Pontiac," one of the most brilliant and fascinating books that has ever
</p>
<p>been tcritten by any historian since the days of Herodotus.  Prof. John Fiske.
</p>
<p>We follow the casualties of battle with the intense interest of one who has friends or
</p>
<p>acquaintances there. Mr. Parkman^s familiarity also with the scenery of his narratives is so
</p>
<p>intimate, his memory of the eye is so vivid, as almost to persuade us that ourselves hare seen
</p>
<p>what he describes. . . '. One of the convincing tests of genius is the choice of a theme, and
</p>
<p>no greater felicitv can befall it than to find one both familiar and fresh. ... In the in-
</p>
<p>stinct that led him straight to subjects that seemed waiting for him so long, Mr. Parkman
</p>
<p>gave no nr.certain proof' of his fitness for an adequate treatment of them.  James liussell
</p>
<p>Lowell (November " Century "). The last piece of writiny prepared by him for publication.
</p>
<p>Editor of the " Century."
</p>
<p>It is possible that the historian of the last quarter of the nineteenth century in America
</p>
<p>tf(7/ find few events more notable than the completion of the work of Mr. Francis Parkman,
</p>
<p>tiiat series of historical narratives, now at last grown to one whole, in which the romantic
</p>
<p>storv of tlie rise, the marvellous expansion, and the ill-fated ending of the French power in
</p>
<p>North America is for tlie first time adequately told. . . . Mr. Parkman belongs distinctly
</p>
<p>to the class of learned historical scholars who are also skilful and charming tcriters. His
</p>
<p>books, to borrow a phrase from Augustin Thierrj^ are important additions to historical
</p>
<p>science, and at the same time works of literary art.  Note on the Completion of Mr. Park-
</p>
<p>man's Work, Edward Eggleston, in November Century.

<p>(iONSPIEACY OF PONTIAC,

<p>CHAP1TR XVIII.

<p>1763.
</p>
<p>FRONTIER FORTS AND SETTLEMENTS.
</p>
<p>We have followed the war to its farthest confines,
</p>
<p>and watched it in its remotest operations ; not
</p>
<p>because there is any thing especially worthy to be
</p>
<p>chronicled in the capture of a backwoods fort, and
</p>
<p>the slaughter of a few soldiers, but because these
</p>
<p>acts exhibit some of the characteristic traits of the
</p>
<p>actors. It was along the line of the British fron-
</p>
<p>tier that the war raged with its most destructive
</p>
<p>violence. To destroy the garrisons, and then turn
</p>
<p>upon the settlements, had been the original plan of
</p>
<p>the Indians ; and while Pontiac was pushing the
</p>
<p>siege of Detroit, and the smaller interior posts
</p>
<p>were treacherously assailed, the tempest was gath-
</p>
<p>ering which was soon to burst along the whole
</p>
<p>frontier.
</p>
<p>In 1763, the British settlements did not extend
</p>
<p>beyond the Alleghanies. In the province of New
</p>
<p>York, they reached no farther than the German

<p>Flats, on the Mohawk. In Pennsylvania, the town
</p>
<p>2 FROIJTIER FORTS A2sD SETTLEMENTS. |176b
</p>
<p>of Bedford might be regarded as the extreme verge
</p>
<p>of the frontier, while the settlements of Virginia
</p>
<p>extended to a corresponding distance. Through
</p>
<p>the adjacent wilderness ran various lines of mili-
</p>
<p>tary posts, to make good the communication from
</p>
<p>point to point. One of the most important among
</p>
<p>these passed through the country of the Six Nations,
</p>
<p>and guarded the route between the northern col-
</p>
<p>onies and Lake Ontario. This communication was
</p>
<p>formed by the Hudson, the Mohawk, Wood Creek,
</p>
<p>the Oneida Lake, and the Eiver Oswego. It was
</p>
<p>defended by Forts Stanwix, Brewerton, Oswego,
</p>
<p>and two or three smaller posts. Near the western
</p>
<p>extremity of Lake Ontario stood Fort Niagara, at
</p>
<p>the mouth of the river whence it derived its name.
</p>
<p>It was a strong and extensive work, guarding the
</p>
<p>access to the whole interior country, both by way
</p>
<p>of the Oswego communication just mentioned, and
</p>
<p>by that of Canada and the St. Lawrence. From
</p>
<p>Fort Niagara the route lay by a portage beside
</p>
<p>the great falls to Presqu' Isle, on Lake Erie, where
</p>
<p>the town of Erie now stands. Thence the traveller
</p>
<p>could pass, by a short overland passage, to Fort Le
</p>
<p>Boeuf, on a branch of the Alleghany ; thence, by
</p>
<p>water, to Venango ; and thence, down the Alle-
</p>
<p>ghany, to Fort Pitt. This last- mentioned post etood
</p>
<p>on the present site of Pittsburg  the point of land
</p>
<p>formed by the confluence of the Alleghany and
</p>
<p>the Monongahela. Its position was as captivating
</p>
<p>to the eye of an artist as it w^as commanding in a
</p>
<p>milita-y point of view. On the left, the Monon

<p>gular beauty ; on the right, flowed the Alleghany^
</p>
<p>beneath steep and lofty banks ; and both united, in
</p>
<p>front, to form the broad Ohio, which, flanked by
</p>
<p>picturesque hills and declivities, began at this point
</p>
<p>its progress towards the Mississippi. The place
</p>
<p>already had its historic associations, though, as yet,
</p>
<p>their roughness was unmellowed by the lapse of
</p>
<p>time. It was here that the French had erected
</p>
<p>Fort du Quesne. Within a few miles, Braddock
</p>
<p>encountered his disastrous overthrow ; and on the
</p>
<p>hill behind the fort. Grant's Highlanders and
</p>
<p>Lewis's Virginians had been surrounded and cap-
</p>
<p>tured, though not without a stout resistance on the
</p>
<p>part of the latter.
</p>
<p>Fort Pitt was built by General Stanwdx, in the
</p>
<p>year 1759, upon the ruins of Fort du Quesne,
</p>
<p>destroyed by General Forbes. It was a strong
</p>
<p>fortification, with ramparts of earth, faced with
</p>
<p>brick on the side looking down the Ohio. Its
</p>
<p>walls have long since been levelled to the ground,
</p>
<p>and over their ruins have risen warehouses, and
</p>
<p>forges with countless chimneys, rolling up their
</p>
<p>black volumes of smoke. Where once the bark
</p>
<p>canoe lay on the strand, a throng of steamers now
</p>
<p>lie moored along the crowded levee.
</p>
<p>Fort Pitt stood far aloof in the forest, and one
</p>
<p>might journey eastward full two hundred miles,
</p>
<p>before the English settlements began to thicken.
</p>
<p>Behind it lay a broken and Avoody tract; then
</p>
<p>succeeded the great barrier of the Alleghanies,
</p>
<p>traversing the country in successive ridges ; and

<p>beyond these lay vast woods, extending "-q *he

<p>Susquehanna. Eastward of this river, cabins of
</p>
<p>settlers became more numerous, until, in the neigh-
</p>
<p>borhood of Lancaster, the country assumed an
</p>
<p>appearance of prosperity and cultivation. Two
</p>
<p>roads led from Fort Pitt to the settlements, one of
</p>
<p>which was cut by General Braddock in his disas-
</p>
<p>trous march across the mountains, from Cumber
</p>
<p>land, in the year 1755. The other, which was the
</p>
<p>more frequented, passed by Carlisle and Bedford,
</p>
<p>and was made by General Forbes, in 1758. Leav-
</p>
<p>ing the fort by this latter route, the traveller would
</p>
<p>find himself, after a journey of fifty-six miles, at the
</p>
<p>little post of Ligonier, whence he would soon reach
</p>
<p>Fort Bedford, about a hundred miles from Fort Pitt-
</p>
<p>It was nestled among mountains, and surrounded
</p>
<p>by clearings and log cabins. Passing several small
</p>
<p>posts and settlements, he would arrive at Carlisle,
</p>
<p>nearly a hundred miles farther east, a place resem-
</p>
<p>bling Bedford in its general aspect, although of
</p>
<p>greater extent. After leaving Fort Bedford, nu
</p>
<p>merous houses of settlers were scattered here and
</p>
<p>there among the valleys, on each side of the road
</p>
<p>from Fort Pitt, so that the number of families
</p>
<p>beyond the Susquehanna amounted to several hun-
</p>
<p>dreds, thinly distributed over a great space. ^ From
</p>
<p>Carlisle to Harris's Ferry, now Harrisburg, on the
</p>
<p>Susquehanna, was but a short distance ; and from
</p>
<p>thence, the road led directly into the heart of the
</p>
<p>settlements. The frontiers of Virginia bore a
</p>
<p>general resemblance to those of PeniisylvMuia. It

</p>
<p>the position of their scattered settlements, and the
</p>
<p>small posts intended to protect them.' xllong
</p>
<p>these borders all had remained quiet, and nothing
</p>
<p>occurred to excite alarm or uneasiness. Captain
</p>
<p>Simeon Ecuyer, a brave Swiss officer, who com-
</p>
<p>manded at Fort Pitt, had indeed received warnings
</p>
<p>of danger. On the fourth of May, he wrote to
</p>
<p>Colonel Bouquet at Philadelphia : " Major Glad-
</p>
<p>wyn writes to tell me that I am surrounded by ras
</p>
<p>cals. He complains a great deal of the Delawares
</p>
<p>and Shawanoes. It is this canaille who stir up the
</p>
<p>rest to mischief." At length, on the twenty-seventh,
</p>
<p>at about dusk in the evening, a party of Indians
</p>
<p>was seen descending the banks of the Alleghany,
</p>
<p>with laden pack-horses. They built fires, and
</p>
<p>encamped on the shore till daybreak, when they all
</p>
<p>crossed over to the fort, bringing with them a great
</p>
<p>quantity of valuable furs. These they sold to the
</p>
<p>traders, demanding, in exchange, bullets, hatchets,
</p>
<p>and gunpowder ; but their conduct was so peculiar as
</p>
<p>to excite the just suspicion that they came either as
</p>
<p>spies or with some other insidious design.^ Hardly
</p>
<p>were they gone, when tidings came in that Colonel
</p>
<p>Clapham, with several persons, both men and
</p>
<p>women, had been murdered and scalped near
</p>
<p>the fort ; and it was soon after discovered that the

</p>
<p>bent on some plan of mischief. On the next day,
</p>
<p>two soldiers were shot within a mile of the fort.
</p>
<p>An express was hastily sent to Venango, to warn
</p>
<p>the little garrison of danger ; but he returned
</p>
<p>almost immediately, having been twice iired at, and
</p>
<p>severely wounded.^ A trader named Calhoun now
</p>
<p>came in from the Indian village of Tuscaroras, with
</p>
<p>intelligence of a yet more startling kind. x\t eleven
</p>
<p>o'clock on the night of the twenty-seventh, a chief
</p>
<p>named Shingas, with several of the principal war-
</p>
<p>riors in the place, had come to Calhoun's cabin, and
</p>
<p>earnestly begged him to depart, declaring that they
</p>
<p>did not wish to see him killed before their eyes.

<p>all tlie forts of the interior. The Delawares and
</p>
<p>Shavvanoes of the Ohio were following their exam-
</p>
<p>ple^ and were murdering all the traders among
</p>
<p>them. Calhoun and the thirteen men in his em-
</p>
<p>ploy lost no time in taking their departure. The
</p>
<p>Indians forced them to leave their guns behind,
</p>
<p>promising that they would give them three war-
</p>
<p>riors to guide them in safety to Fort Pitt ; but
</p>
<p>the whole proved a piece of characteristic dissimu-
</p>
<p>lation and treachery. The three guides led them
</p>
<p>into an ambuscade at the mouth of Beaver Creek.
</p>
<p>A volley of balls showered upon them ; eleven
</p>
<p>were killed on the spot, and Calhoun and two
</p>
<p>others alone made their escape.* " I see," writes
</p>
<p>Ecuyer to his colonel, " that the affair is general.
</p>
<p>I tremble for our outposts. I believe, from what I
</p>
<p>hear, that I am surrounded by Indians. I neglect
</p>
<p>nothing to give them a good reception ; and 1

<p>expect to be attacked to-morrow morning. Please

<p>God I may be. I am passably well prepared.

<p>Everybody is at work, and I do not sleep ; but I

<p>tremble lest my messenger should be cut off."
</p>
<p>The intelligence concerning the fate of the
</p>
<p>traders in the Indian villages proved but too
</p>
<p>true. They were slaughtered everywhere, without
</p>
<p>mercy, and often under circumstances of the foulest
</p>
<p>barbarity. A boy named M'CuUough, captured
</p>
<p>during the French war, and at this time a prisoner

<p>among the Indians, relates, in his published narra-

<p>the body of a trader, which lay by the side of the
</p>
<p>path, mangled with tomahawks, and stuck full ol
</p>
<p>arrows.^ It was stated in the journals of the day,
</p>
<p>that more than a hundred traders fell victims, and
</p>
<p>that the property taken from them, or seized at
</p>
<p>the capture of the interior posts, amounted to an
</p>
<p>incredible sum.^
</p>
<p>1 M'Cullough gives the following account of the murder of another of
</p>
<p>the traders named Green : 
</p>
<p>"About sunrise, Mussoughwhese (an Indian, my adopted brother'f
</p>
<p>nephew, known by the name of Ben Dickson, among the white people),
</p>
<p>came to our house ; he had a pistol and a large scalping-knife, concealed
</p>
<p>under his blanket, belted round his body. He informed Kett johhalend (for
</p>
<p>that was my adopted brother's name), that he came to kill Tom Green;
</p>
<p>but Kettoohhalend endeavoured to persuade him off it. They walked out
</p>
<p>together, and Green followed them, endeavouring, as I suppose, to dis-
</p>
<p>cover the cause of the alarm the night before; in a short time they
</p>
<p>returned to the house, and immediately went out again. Green asked
</p>
<p>me to bring him his horse, as we heard the bell a short distance off; he
</p>
<p>then went after the Indians again, and I went for the horse. As I was
</p>
<p>returning, I observed them coming out of a house about two hundred
</p>
<p>yards from ours ; Kettoohhalend was foremost, Green in the middle ; I
</p>
<p>took but slight notice of them, until I heard the report of a pistol ; I cast
</p>
<p>my eyes towards them, and observed the smoke, and saw Green standing
</p>
<p>on the side of the path, with his hands across his breast ; I thought it had
</p>
<p>been him that shot ; he stood a few minutes, then fell on his face across
</p>
<p>the path. I instantly got off the horse, and held him by the bridle,
</p>
<p>Kettoohhalend sunk his pipe tomahawk into his skull ; Mussourjhwhese
</p>
<p>stabbed him under the armpit with his scalping-knife ; he had shot him
</p>
<p>between the shoulders with his pistol. The squaws gathered about him
</p>
<p>and stiipped him naked, trailed him down the bank, and plunged him
</p>
<p>into the creek ; there was a freshet in the creek at the time, which carried
</p>
<p>liim off. Mussour/hwhese then came to me (where I was holding the horse,
</p>
<p>AS I had not moved from the spot where I was when Green was shot),

<p>with the bloody knife in his hand ; he told me that lie was coming to kill
</p>
<p>me next ; he reached out his hand and took hold of the bridle, telling me
</p>
<p>that that was his horse ; I was glad to parley with him on the terms, and
</p>
<p>delivered the horse to him. All the Indians in the town immediately
</p>
<p>collected together, and started off to the Salt Licks, where the rest of the
</p>

<p>1768, May] A CURIOUS INCIDENT. 9
</p>
<p>The Moravian Loskiel relates that in the villages
</p>
<p>of the Hurons or Wyandots, meaning probably
</p>
<p>those of Sandusky, the traders were so numerous
</p>
<p>that the Indians were afraid to attack them openly,
</p>
<p>and had recourse to the following stratagem : They
</p>
<p>told their unsuspecting victims that the surrounding
</p>
<p>tribes had risen in arms,- and were soon coming that
</p>
<p>way, bent on killing every Englishman they could
</p>
<p>find. The Wyandots averred that they would
</p>
<p>gladly protect their friends, the white men ; but
</p>
<p>that it would be impossible to do so, unless the
</p>
<p>latter would consent, for the sake of appearances,
</p>
<p>to become their prisoners. In this case, they said,
</p>
<p>the hostile Indians would refrain from injuring
</p>
<p>them, and they should be set at liberty as soon
</p>
<p>as the danger was past. The traders fell into the
</p>
<p>snare. They gave up their arms, and, the better
</p>
<p>to carry out the deception, even consented to be
</p>
<p>bound ; but no sooner was this accomplished, than
</p>
<p>their treacherous counsellors murdered them all in
</p>
<p>nold blood.^
</p>
<p>A curious incident, relating to this period, is
</p>
<p>given by the missionary Heckewelder. Strange
</p>
<p>as the story may appear, it is in strict accordance
</p>
<p>with Indian character and usage, and perhaps need
</p>
<p>not be rejected as wholly void of truth. The name
</p>
<p>of the person, to whom it relates, several times
</p>
<p>occurs in the manuscript journals and correspond-
</p>
<p>ence of officers in the Indian country. A trader
</p>
<p>named Chapman was made prisoner by the Indiana
</p>
<p>near Detroit. For some time, he was rotected by

<p>the humane interference of a Frenchman ; but at
</p>
<p>length his captors resolved to burn him alive. He
</p>
<p>was tied to the stake, and the fire was kindled. As
</p>
<p>the heat grew intolerable, one of the Indians
</p>
<p>handed to him a bowl filled with brotli*. The
</p>
<p>wretched man, scorching with fiery thirst, eagerly
</p>
<p>snatched the vessel, and applied it to his lips ; but
</p>
<p>the liquid was purposely made scalding hot. With
</p>
<p>a sudden burst of rage, he flung back the bowl and
</p>
<p>its contents into the face of the Indian. '' He is
</p>
<p>mad ! he is mad ! " shouted the crowd ; and though,
</p>
<p>the moment before, they had been keenly antici-
</p>
<p>pating the delight of seeing him burn, they hastily
</p>
<p>put out the fire, released him from the stake,
</p>
<p>and set him at hberty.^ Such is the superstitious
</p>
<p>respect which the Indians entertain for every form
</p>
<p>of insanity.
</p>
<p>While the alarming incidents just mentioned
</p>
<p>were occurring at Fort Pitt, the garrison of Fort
</p>
<p>Ligonier received yet more unequivocal tokens of
</p>
<p>hostdity ; for one morning a volley of bullets was
</p>
<p>sent among them, with no other effect, however,
</p>
<p>than killing a few horses. In the vicinity of Fort
</p>
<p>Bedford, several men were killed ; on which the
</p>
<p>inhabitants were mustered and organized, and the
</p>
<p>garrison kept constantly on the alert. A few of
</p>
<p>the best woodsmen were formed into a company,
</p>
<p>dressed and painted like Indians. A party of tne
</p>
<p>enemy suddenly appeared, whooping and brandisn-
</p>
<p>ing their tomahawks, at the skirts of the forest;

</p>
<p>At Fort Pitt every pre23aration was made for an
</p>
<p>attack. The houses and cabins outside the rampart
</p>
<p>were levelled to the ground, and every morning, at
</p>
<p>an hour before dawn, the drum beat, and the troops
</p>
<p>were ordered to their alarm posts.^ The garrison
</p>
<p>consisted of three hundred and thirty soldiers,
</p>
<p>traders, and backwoodsmen ; and there were also
</p>
<p>in the fort about one hundred women, and a still
</p>
<p>greater number of children, most of them belong-
</p>
<p>ing to the families of settlers who were preparing
</p>
<p>to build their cabins in the neighborhood.^ " We
</p>
<p>are so crowded in the fort," writes Ecuyer to Colonel
</p>
<p>Bouquet, " that I fear disease ; for, in spite of every
</p>
<p>care, I cannot keep the place as clean as I should
</p>
<p>like. Besides, the small-pox is among us ; and I

<p>have therefore caused a hospital to be built under

<p>and never expose them witho\it necessity. This, ]
</p>
<p>think, is what you require of me." ^ The desultory
</p>
<p>outrages with which the war began, and which
</p>
<p>only served to put the garrison on their guard,
</p>
<p>prove that among the neighboring Indians there
</p>
<p>was no chief of sufficient power to curb their w^ay-
</p>
<p>ward temper, and force them to conform to any
</p>
<p>preconcerted plan. The authors of the mischief
</p>
<p>were unruly young warriors, fevered with eagerness
</p>
<p>to wdn the first scalp, and setting at defiance the
</p>
<p>authority of their elders. These petty annoyances,
</p>
<p>far from abating, continued for many successive
</p>
<p>days, and kept the garrison in a state of restless
</p>
<p>alarm. It was dangerous to venture outside the
</p>
<p>walls, and a few who attempted it were shot and
</p>
<p>scalped by lurking Indians. " They have the im-
</p>
<p>pudence," writes an officer, " to fire all night at
</p>
<p>our sentinels ; " nor were these attacks confined to
</p>
<p>the night, for even during the day no man willingly
</p>
<p>exposed his head above the rampart. The sur-
</p>
<p>rounding w^oods were known to be full of prowling
</p>
<p>Indians, whose number seemed daily increasing,
</p>
<p>though as yet they had made no attempt at a gen-
</p>
<p>eral attack. At length, on the afternoon of the
</p>
<p>twenty* second of June, a party of them appeared
</p>
<p>at the farthest extremity of the cleared lands be-
</p>
<p>hind the fort, driving off the horses which were
</p>
<p>grazing there, and killing the cattle. No sooner
</p>
<p>w^as this accomplished than a general ffi*e was
</p>
<p>opened upon the fort from every side at once,
</p>
<p>though at so great a distance that only two men

<p>were killed. Tlie garrison replied by a discharge
</p>
<p>of howitzers, the shells of which, bursting in the
</p>
<p>midst of the Indians, greatly amazed and discon-
</p>
<p>certed them. As it grew dark, their fire slackened,
</p>
<p>though, throughout the night, the flash of guns
</p>
<p>was seen at frequent intervals, followed by the
</p>
<p>whooping of the invisible assailants.
</p>
<p>At nine o'clock on the following morning, several
</p>
<p>Indians approached the fort with the utmost con-
</p>
<p>fidence, and took their stand at the outer edge of
</p>
<p>the ditch, where one of them, a Delaware, named
</p>
<p>the Turtle's Heart, addressed the garrison as fol-
</p>
<p>lows : 
</p>
<p>" My Brothers, we that stand here are your
</p>
<p>friends ; but we have bad news to tell you. Six
</p>
<p>great nations of Indians have taken up the hatchet,
</p>
<p>and cut off all the English garrisons, excepting
</p>
<p>yours. They are now on their way to destroy you
</p>
<p>also.
</p>
<p>" My Brothers, we are your friends, and we wish
</p>
<p>to save your lives. What we desire you to do is
</p>
<p>this : You must leave this fort, with all your women
</p>
<p>and children, and go down to the English settle-
</p>
<p>ments, where you will be safe. There are many
</p>
<p>bad Indians already here ; but we will protect you
</p>
<p>from them. You must go at once, because if you
</p>
<p>wait till the six great nations arrive here, you will
</p>
<p>all be killed, and we can do nothing to protect
</p>
<p>you."

</p>
<p>gain a safe and easy possession of the fort, Captain

<p>humor perceptible in it may serve to indicate that
</p>
<p>he was nnder no great apprehension for the safety
</p>
<p>of his garrison : 
</p>
<p>" My Brothers, we are very grateful for your
</p>
<p>kindness, though we are convinced that you must
</p>
<p>be mistaken in what you have told us about the
</p>
<p>forts being captured. As for ourselves, we have
</p>
<p>plenty of provisions, and are able to keep the fort
</p>
<p>against all the nations of Indians that may dare to
</p>
<p>attack it. We are very well off in this place, and
</p>
<p>we mean to stay here.
</p>
<p>" My Brothers, as you have shown yourselves
</p>
<p>such true friends, we feel bound in gratitude to
</p>
<p>inform you that an army of six thousand English
</p>
<p>will shortly arrive here, and that another army ot
</p>
<p>three thousand is gone up the lakes, to punish the
</p>
<p>Ottawas and Ojibwas. A third has gone to the
</p>
<p>frontiers of Virginia, where they will be joined by
</p>
<p>your enemies, the Cherokees and Catawbas, who are
</p>
<p>coming here to destroy you. Therefore take pity
</p>
<p>on your women and children, and get out of the
</p>
<p>way as soon as possible. We have told you this
</p>
<p>in confidence, out of oui great solicitude lest any
</p>
<p>of you should be hurt ; and we hope that you will
</p>
<p>not tell the other Indians, lest they should escape
</p>
<p>from our vengeance." *
</p>
<p>This politic invention of the three armies had
</p>
<p>an excellent effect, and so startled the Indians, that,
</p>
<p>on the next day, most of them withdrew from the

<p>neighborhood, and went to meet a great body of

</p>
<p>warriors, who were advancing from the westward
</p>
<p>to attack the fort. On the afternoon of the twen-
</p>
<p>ty-sixth, a soldier named Gray, helonging to the
</p>
<p>garrison of Presqu' Isle, came in with the report
</p>
<p>that, more than a week before, that little post had
</p>
<p>been fnriously attacked by upwards of two hundred
</p>
<p>Indians from Detroit, that they had assailed it for
</p>
<p>three days, repeatedly setting it on fire, and had
</p>
<p>at length undermined it so completely, that the
</p>
<p>garrison was forced to capitulate, on condition of
</p>
<p>being allowed to retire in safety to Fort Pitt. No
</p>
<p>sooner, however, had they left their shelter, than
</p>
<p>the Indians fell upon them, and, as Gray declared,
</p>
<p>butchered them all, except himself and one other
</p>
<p>man, who darted into the woods, and escaped amid
</p>
<p>the confusion, hearing behind them, as they fled,
</p>
<p>the screams of their murdered comrades. This
</p>
<p>account proved erroneous, as the garrison w^ere
</p>
<p>carried by their captors in safety to Detroit. Some
</p>
<p>time after this event, Captain Dalzell's detachment,
</p>
<p>on their way to Detroit, stopped at the place, and
</p>
<p>found, close to the ruined fort, the hair of several
</p>
<p>of the men, which had been shorn off, as a prelim-
</p>
<p>inary step in the process of painting and bedecking
</p>
<p>them like Indian warriors. From this it appears
</p>
<p>that some of the unfortunate soldiers were adopted
</p>
<p>on the spot into the tribes of their conquerors. In
</p>
<p>a previous chapter, a . detailed account has been
</p>
<p>given of the defence of Presqu' Isle, and its cap-
</p>
<p>ture.

<p>before the attack on the garrison, tbey had seen a

</p>
<p>schooner on the lake, approaching from the west-
</p>
<p>ward. She had sent a boat to shore with the tid-
</p>
<p>ings that Detroit had been beleaguered, for more
</p>
<p>tlian six weeks, by many hundred Indians, and that
</p>
<p>a detachment of ninety-six men had been attacked
</p>
<p>near that place, of whom only about thirty had
</p>
<p>escaped, the rest being either killed on the spot
</p>
<p>or put to death by slow torture. The panic-stricken
</p>
<p>soldier, in his flight from Presqu' Isle, had passed
</p>
<p>the spots where lately had stood the little forts of
</p>
<p>Le Bceuf and Venango. Both were burnt to the
</p>
<p>ground, and he surmised that the whole of their
</p>
<p>wretched garrisons had fallen victims.^ The dis-
</p>
<p>aster proved less fatal than his fears led him to
</p>
<p>suspect ; for, on the same day on which he arrived,
</p>
<p>Ensign Price, the officer commanding at Le Boeuf,
</p>
<p>was seen approaching along the bank of the Alle-
</p>
<p>ghany, followed by seven haggard and half-fam-
</p>
<p>ished soldiers.^ He and his men told the following

<p>story :

<p>" This Morning, Ensign Price, of the Royal Americans, with Part of
</p>
<p>his Garrison, arrived liere, being separated from tlie '-est in the night. 
</p>
<p>The Enemy attacked his Post, and set it on Fire, and while they watched
</p>
<p>the Door of the House, he got out on the other side, and the Indians
</p>
<p>continued firmg a long Time afterwards, imagining that the Garrisor
</p>
<p>was in it, and that they were consumed with the House.  He touched at

</p>
<p>The available defences of Fort Le Bceuf con-
</p>
<p>sisted, at the time, of a single ill-constructed block-
</p>
<p>house, occupied by the ensign, with two corporals
</p>
<p>ar i eleven privates. They had only about twenty
</p>
<p>rcands of ammunition each ; and the powder, more
</p>
<p>over, Avas in a damaged condition. At nine or ten
</p>
<p>o'clock, on the morning of the eighteenth of June,
</p>
<p>a soldier told Price that he saw Indians approach-
</p>
<p>ing from the direction of Presqu' Isle. Price ran
</p>
<p>to the door, and, looking out, saw one of his men,
</p>
<p>apparently much frightened, shaking hands with
</p>
<p>five Indians. He held open the door till the man
</p>
<p>had entered, the ^ve Indians following close, after
</p>
<p>having, in obedience to a sign from Price, left their
</p>
<p>weapons behind. They declared that they were
</p>
<p>going to fight the Cherokees, and begged for pow-
</p>
<p>der and ball. This being refused, they asked leave
</p>
<p>to sleep on the ground before the blockhouse.
</p>
<p>Price assented, on which one of them went off, but
</p>
<p>very soon returned with thirty more, who crowded
</p>
<p>before the window of the blockhouse, and begged
</p>
<p>for a kettle to cook their food. Price tried to give
</p>
<p>them one through the window, but the aperture
</p>
<p>proved too narrow, and they grew clamorous that
</p>
<p>he should open the door again. This he refused.
</p>
<p>Soldier also says, he suspected they intended to put them all to Death ;
</p>
<p>and that on hearing a Woman scream out, he supposed they were raur
</p>
<p>dering her; upon which he and another Soldier came immediately off,
</p>
<p>but knows not>^ing of the rest : That the Vessel from Niagara was in
</p>
<p>Sight, but believes she had no Provisions, as the Indians told them they
</p>
<p>had cut off Little Niagara, and destroyed 800 Barrels : And that he thinks,
</p>
<p>by what he saw, Venango had capitulated."

<p>They then went to a neighboring storehouse, pulled
</p>
<p>out some of the foundation stones, and got into the
</p>
<p>cellar ; whence, by knocking away one or two planks
</p>
<p>immediately above the sill of the building, they
</p>
<p>could fire on the garrison in perfect safety, being
</p>
<p>below the range of shot from the loopholes of llif
</p>
<p>blockhouse, which was not ten yards distant. Here
</p>
<p>they remained some hours, making their prepara-
</p>
<p>tions, while the garrison waited in suspense, cooped
</p>
<p>up in their wooden citadel. Towards evening, they
</p>
<p>opened fire, and shot such a number of burning
</p>
<p>arrows against the side and roof of the blockhouse,
</p>
<p>that three several times it was in flames. But the
</p>
<p>men worked desperately, and each time the fire was
</p>
<p>extinguished. A fourth time the alarm was given ;
</p>
<p>and now the men on the roof came down in de-
</p>
<p>spair, crying out that they could not extinguish it,
</p>
<p>and calling on their ofiicer for God's sake to let
</p>
<p>them leave the building, or they should all be burnt
</p>
<p>alive. Price behaved with great spirit. " We
</p>
<p>must fight as long as we can, and then die to-
</p>
<p>gether," was his answer to the entreaties of his
</p>
<p>disheartened men.^ But he could not revive their
</p>
<p>iirooping courage, and meanwhile the fire spread
</p>
<p>beyond all hope of mastering it. They implored
</p>
<p>him to let them go, and at length the brave young

</p>
<p>darkness,  for night had closed in,  escaped to
</p>
<p>the neighboring pine-swamp, while the Indians, to
</p>
<p>make assurance doubly sure, were still showering
</p>
<p>fire-arrows against the front of the blazing build-
</p>
<p>ing. As the fugitives groped their way, in pitchy
</p>
<p>darkness, through the tangled intricacies of the
</p>
<p>swamp, they saw the sky behind them lurid with
</p>
<p>flames, and heard the reports of the Indians' guns,
</p>
<p>as these painted demons were leaping and yelling
</p>
<p>in front of the flaming blockhouse, firing into
</p>
<p>the loopholes, and exulting in the thought that
</p>
<p>their enemies were suffering the agonies of death
</p>
<p>within.
</p>
<p>Presqu Isle was but fifteen miles distant ; but,
</p>
<p>from the direction in Avhich his assailants had come,
</p>
<p>Price rightly judged that it had been captured, and
</p>
<p>therefore resolved to make his way, if possible,
</p>
<p>to Venango, and reinforce Lieutenant Gordon, who
</p>
<p>commanded there. A soldier named John Dortin-
</p>
<p>ger, who had been sixteen months at Le Bceuf,
</p>
<p>thought that he could guide the party, but lost the
</p>
<p>way in the darkness ; so that, after struggling all
</p>
<p>night through swamps and forests, they found them-
</p>
<p>selves at daybreak only two miles from their point
</p>
<p>of departure. Just before dawn, several of the
</p>
<p>men became separated from the rest. Price and
</p>
<p>those with him waited for some time, whistling,
</p>
<p>coughing, and making such other signals as they
</p>
<p>dared, to attract their attention, but without suc-
</p>
<p>cess, and they were forced to proceed without them

<p>This done, they burned the place to the ground,

<p>and departed.^
</p>
<p>While Le Boeuf and Venango were thus assailed,
</p>
<p>Fort Ligonier was also attacked by a large body of
</p>
<p>Indians, who fired upon it with great fury and per
</p>
<p>tinacity, but were beaten off after a hard day's
</p>
<p>fighting. Fort Augusta, on the Susquehanna, was
</p>
<p>at the same time menaced ; but the garrison being
</p>
<p>strengthened by a timely re-enforcement, the Indi
</p>
<p>ans abandoned their purpose. Carlisle, Bedford,

<p>and the small intermediate posts, all experienced
</p>

<p>and sufferings endured, which defy all attempt at
</p>
<p>description.
</p>
<p>At Fort Pitt, every preparation was made to repel
</p>
<p>the attack which was hourly expected. A part of
</p>
<p>the rampart, undermined by the spring floods, had
</p>
<p>(Allien into the ditch ; but, by dint of great labor,
</p>
<p>this injury was repaired. A line of palisades Avas
</p>
<p>erected along the ramparts ; the barracks were ^.ade
</p>
<p>shot-proof, to protect the women and children ; and,
</p>
<p>as the interior buildings were all of wood, a rude
</p>
<p>fire-engine was constructed, to extinguish any flames
</p>
<p>which might be kindled by the burning arrows of
</p>
<p>the Indians. Several weeks, however, elapsed
</p>
<p>without any determined attack from the enemy,
</p>
<p>who were engaged in their bloody work among the
</p>
<p>settlements and smaller posts. From the beginning
</p>
<p>of July until towards its close, nothing occurred
</p>
<p>except a series of petty and futile attacks, by which
</p>
<p>the Indians abundantly exhibited their malicious
</p>
<p>intentions, without doing harm to the garrison.
</p>
<p>During the whole of this time, the communication
</p>
<p>with the settlements was completely cut off, so that
</p>
<p>no letters were written from the fort, or, at all
</p>
<p>events, none reached their destination ; and we are
</p>
<p>therefore left to depend upon a few meagre official
</p>
<p>reports, as our only sources of information.
</p>
<p>On the twenty-sixth of July, a small p^irty of
</p>
<p>Indians was seen approaching the gate, displa}hig
</p>
<p>a flag, which one of them had some time before
</p>
<p>received as a present from the EngHsh commander

<p>On the strength of this token, they were admitted,

<p>whom were Shingas, Turtle's Heart, and others,
</p>
<p>who had hitherto niaintamed an appearance of
</p>
<p>friendship. Being admitted to a council, one of
</p>
<p>th^m addressed Captain Ecuyer and his officers
</p>
<p>to the following effect : 
</p>
<p>" Brothers, wdiat we are about to say comes from
</p>
<p>our hearts, and not from our lips.
</p>
<p>" Brothers, we wish to hold fast the chain ot
</p>
<p>friendship  that ancient chain which our fore-
</p>
<p>fathers held with their brethren the English. You
</p>
<p>have let your end of the chain fall to the ground,
</p>
<p>but ours is still fast within our hands. Why do
</p>
<p>you complain that our young men have fired at
</p>
<p>your soldiers, and killed your cattle and your
</p>
<p>horses ? You yourselves are the cause of this.
</p>
<p>You marched your armies into our country, and
</p>
<p>built forts here, though we told you, again and
</p>
<p>again, that w^e wished you to remove. My Broth-
</p>
<p>ers, this land is ours, and not yours.
</p>
<p>" My Brothers, two days ago we received a great
</p>
<p>belt of w^ampum from the Ottawas of Detroit, and
</p>
<p>the message they sent us was in these words : 
</p>
<p>" ' Grandfathers the Delawares, by this belt we
</p>
<p>inform you that in a short time we intend to pass,
</p>
<p>in a ver) great body, through your country, on oui
</p>
<p>way to strike the English at the forks of the Ohio.
</p>
<p>Grandfathers, you know us to be a headstrong
</p>
<p>people. We are determined to stop at nothing ;
</p>
<p>and as ^ye expect to be very hungry, we will seize
</p>
<p>and eat up every diing that comes in our way.' ^

</p>
<p>go home to your wives and children, no harm will
</p>
<p>come of it ; but if you stay, you must blame your-
</p>
<p>selves alone for what may happen. Therefore wc
</p>
<p>desire you to remove."
</p>
<p>Tc the not wholly unreasonable statement ol
</p>
<p>wrciigs contained in this speech. Captain Ecuyer
</p>
<p>replied, by urging the shallow pretence that the
</p>
<p>forts were built foi the purpose of supplying the
</p>
<p>Indians with clothes and ammunition. He then
</p>
<p>absolutely refused to leave the place. " I have,"
</p>
<p>he said, " warriors, provisions, and ammunition, t&.
</p>
<p>defend it three years against all the Indians in the
</p>
<p>woods ; and we shall never abandon it as long as
</p>
<p>a white man lives in America. I despise the Otta-
</p>
<p>was, and am very much surprised at our brothers
</p>
<p>the Delawares, for proposing to us to leave this
</p>
<p>place and go home. This is our home. You have
</p>
<p>attacked us without reason or provocation ; you
</p>
<p>have murdered and plundered our warriors and
</p>
<p>traders ; you have taken our horses and cattle ;
</p>
<p>and at the same time you tell us your hearts are
</p>
<p>good towards your brethren the English. How
</p>
<p>can I have faith in you'? Therefore, now, Broth-
</p>
<p>ers, I will advise you to go home to your to>vns,
</p>
<p>and take care of your wives and children. More-
</p>
<p>over, I tell you that if any of you appear again
</p>
<p>about this fort, I will throw bombshells, which will
</p>
<p>burst and blow you to atoms, and fire cannon
</p>
<p>among you, loaded with a whole bag full of bul-
</p>
<p>lets. Therefore take care, for I don't want to
</p>
<p>hurt you." ^

<p> MS. Beport of Conference with the Indians at Fort Pitt, July 26. ITGa.
</p>
<p>1763. JnLY.] ATTACK OF FOIIT PITT. 25
</p>
<p>The chiefs departed, much displeased with tneir
</p>
<p>reception. Though nobody in his senses could
</p>
<p>blame the course pursued by Captain Ecuyer, and
</p>
<p>though the building of forts in the Indian country
</p>
<p>could not be charged as a crime, except by the
</p>
<p>most overstrained casuistry, yet we cannot refrain
</p>
<p>from sympathizing with the intolerable hardship
</p>
<p>to which the progress of civilization subjected the
</p>
<p>unfortunate tenants of the wilderness, and which
</p>
<p>goes far to extenuate the perfidy and cruelty that
</p>
<p>marked their conduct throughout the whole course
</p>
<p>of the war.
</p>
<p>Disappointed of gaining a bloodless possession
</p>
<p>of the fort, the Indians now, for the first time,
</p>
<p>began a general attack. On the night succeeding
</p>
<p>the conference, they approached in great numbers,
</p>
<p>under cover of the darkness, and completely sur
</p>
<p>rounded it ; many of them crawling under the
</p>
<p>banks of the two rivers, and, with incredible per-
</p>
<p>severance, digging, with their knives, holes in
</p>
<p>which they were completely sheltered from the fire
</p>
<p>of the fort. On one side, the whole bank was
</p>
<p>lined with these burrows, from each of which a
</p>
<p>bullet or an arrow was shot out whenever a soldier
</p>
<p>chanced to expose his head. At daybreak, a
</p>
<p>general fire was opened from every side, and con-
</p>
<p>tinued without intermission until night, and through
</p>
<p>several succeeding days. No great harm was done,
</p>
<p>however. The soldiers lay close behind their para-
</p>
<p>pet of logs, w^atching the movements of their subtle
</p>
<p>enemies, and paying back their shot with interest.
</p>
<p>The red uniforms of the Hoyal Americans mingled

<p>the fringed hunting-frocks of old Indian fighters,
</p>
<p>warv and adroit as the red-skinned warriors them
</p>
<p>selves. They liked the sport, and were eager to
</p>
<p>sally from behind their defences, and bring their
</p>
<p>assailants to close quarters ; but Ecuyer was too
</p>
<p>wi?e to consent. He was among them, as well
</p>
<p>pleased as they, directing, encouraging, and ap-
</p>
<p>plauding them in his broken English. An arrow
</p>
<p>flew over the rampart and wounded him in the leg ;
</p>
<p>but, it seems, with no other result than to extort a
</p>
<p>passing execration. The Indians shot fire-arrows,
</p>
<p>too, from their burrows, but not one of them took
</p>
<p>effect. The yelling at times was terrific, and the
</p>
<p>women and children in the crowded barracks clung
</p>
<p>to each other in terror ; but there was more noise
</p>
<p>than execution, and the assailants suffered more
</p>
<p>than the assailed. Three or four days after,
</p>
<p>Ecuyer wrote in French to his colonel, " They were
</p>
<p>all v^eW under cover, and so were we. They did
</p>
<p>us no harm : nobody killed ; seven wounded, and 1
</p>

<p>five nights. We are certain of having killed and
</p>
<p>wounded twenty of them, without reckoning those
</p>
<p>we could not see. I let nobody fire till he had
</p>
<p>marked his man ; and not an Indian could show his
</p>
<p>nose without being pricked with a bullet, for I have
</p>
<p>some good shots here. . . . Our men are doing
</p>
<p>admirably, regulars and the rest. All that they

<p>ask is to go out and fight. I am fortunate to have

<p>17&3.
</p>
<p>THE WAR ON THE BORDERS.
</p>
<p>Along the western frontiers of Pennsylvania
</p>
<p>Maryland, and Virginia, terror reigned supreme
</p>
<p>The Indian scalping-parties were ranging every
</p>
<p>where, laying waste the settlements, destroying the
</p>
<p>harvests, and butchering men, women, and children,
</p>
<p>with ruthless fury. Many hundreds of wretched
</p>
<p>fugitives flocked for refuge to Carlisle and the
</p>
<p>other towns of the border, bringing tales of incon-
</p>
<p>ceivable horror. Strong parties of armed men, who
</p>
<p>went out to reconnoitre the country, found every
</p>
<p>habitation reduced to cinders, and the half-burned
</p>
<p>bodies of the inmates lying among the smouldering
</p>
<p>ruins ; while here and there was seen some miser-
</p>
<p>able wretch, scalped and tomahawked, but still
</p>
<p>alive and conscious. One writing from the midst
</p>
<p>of these scenes declares that, in his opinion, a
</p>
<p>thousand families were driven from their homes ;
</p>
<p>that, on both sides of the Susquehanna, the woods
</p>

</p>
<p>be totally deserted, and Lancaster become the fron

<p>tier town.^
</p>
<p>While tliese scenes were enacted on the borders
</p>
<p>of Pennsyl\;inia and the more southern provinces,
</p>
<p>the settlers in the valley of the Mohawk, and even
</p>
<p>along the Hudson, were menaced with destruction.
</p>
<p>Had not the Six Nations been kept tranquil by the
</p>
<p>exertions of Sir William Johnson, the most disas
</p>
<p>trous results must have ensued. The Senecas and
</p>
<p>a few of the Cayugas were the only members of the
</p>
<p>confederacy who took part in the war. Venango,
</p>
<p>as we have seen, was destroyed by a party of
</p>
<p>Senecas, who soon after made a feeble attack upon
</p>
<p>Niagara. They blockaded it for a few days, with
</p>
<p>no other effect than that of confining the garrison
</p>
<p>within the walls, and, soon despairing of success,
</p>
<p>abandoned the attempt.
</p>
<p>In the mean time. Sir Jeffrey Amherst, the Com
</p>
<p>mander-in- chief, was in a position far from envi-
</p>
<p>able. He had reaped laurels ; but if he hoped to
</p>
<p>enjoy them in peace, he was doomed to disappoint-
</p>
<p>ment. A miserable war was suddenly thrown on
</p>
<p>his hands, barren of honors and fruitful of troubles ;
</p>
<p>and this, too, at a time when he was almost bereft
</p>
<p>of resources. The armies which had conquered
</p>
<p>Canada were, as we have seen, disbanded or sent
</p>
<p>home, and nothing remained but a few fragments
</p>
<p>and skeletons of regiments lately arrived from the
</p>
<p>West Indies, enfeebled by disease and hard ser-
</p>

<p>cers who commanded under his orders in Pennsyl-
</p>
<p>vania, Virginia, and Maryhmd. Colonel Henry
</p>
<p>Bouquet was a Swiss, of the Canton of Berne, who
</p>
<p>had followed the trade of war from boyhood. He
</p>
<p>had served first the King of Sardinia, and after-
</p>
<p>wards the republic of Holland ; and when the
</p>
<p>French war began in 1755, he accepted the com-
</p>
<p>mission of lieutenant-colonel, in a regiment newly
</p>
<p>organized, under the direction of the Duke of Cum-
</p>
<p>berland, expressly for American service. The
</p>
<p>commissions were to be given to foreigners as well
</p>
<p>as to Englishmen and provincials ; and the ranks
</p>
<p>were to be filled chiefly from the German emi-
</p>
<p>grants in Pennsylvania and other provinces.^ The
</p>
<p>men and oflicers of this regiment, known as the
</p>
<p>' Royal American," had now, for more than six
</p>
<p>1 " The next object of the imnieokte att^sntion of Parliament in this
</p>
<p>session was the raising of a new regiment cf foot in North America, for
</p>
<p>which purpose the sum of 81,178 16s. was voted. This regiment, which
</p>
<p>was to consist of four battaUons of 1000 men each, was mtended to be
</p>
<p>raised chiefly out of the Germans and Swiss, who, for many years past,
</p>
<p>had annually transported themselves in great numbers to British plan-
</p>
<p>tations in America, where waste lands had been assigned them upon tho
</p>
<p>h"ontiers of the provinces ; but, very injudiciously, no care had been
</p>
<p>taken to intermix them with the English inhabitants of the place, so that
</p>
<p>very few of them, even of those who have been born there, have yet
</p>
<p>learned to speak or understand the English tongue. However, as they
</p>
<p>were all zealous Protestants, and in general strong, hardy men, accus-
</p>
<p>tomed to the climate, it was judged that a regiment of good and faitlituJ
</p>
<p>soldiers might be raised out of them, particularly proper to oppose ilie
</p>
<p>French ; but to this end it was necessary to appoint some officers, esi)e-
</p>
<p>cially subalterns, who understood military discipline and could speak the
</p>
<p>German language ; and as a sufficient number of such could not be found
</p>
<p>among the English officers, it was necessary to bring over and grant com-

<p>missions to several German and Swiss officers and engineers. But aa
</p>
<p>this step, by the Act of Settlement, could not be taken without the au-
</p>
<p>thority of Parliament, an act was now passed for enabhng his Majesty to
</p>
<p>grant commissions to a certain number of foreign Protestants, who had
</p>
<p>1763, JuNE.j COLONEL BOUQUET *6\
</p>
<p>years, been engaged in the rough and lonely
</p>
<p>service of the frontiers and forests ; and when the
</p>
<p>Indian war broke out, it was chiefly they, who, like
</p>
<p>military hermits, held the detached outposts of the
</p>
<p>West. Bouquet, however, who was at this time
</p>
<p>colonel of the first battalion, had his headquarters
</p>
<p>at Philadelphia, where he was held in great esteem,
</p>
<p>His person was fine, and his bearing composed and
</p>
<p>dignified ; perhaps somewhat austere, for he is said
</p>
<p>to have been more respected than loved by his
</p>
<p>officers. Nevertheless, their letters to him are
</p>
<p>very far from indicating any want of cordial
</p>
<p>relations. He was fond of the society of men of
</p>
<p>science, and wrote English better than most British
</p>
<p>officers of the time. Here and there, however, a
</p>
<p>passage in his letters suggests the inference, that
</p>
<p>the character of the gallant mercenary was toned
</p>
<p>to his profession, and to the unideal epoch in which
</p>
<p>he lived. Yet he was not the less an excellent
</p>
<p>soldier ; indefatigable, faithful, full of resource, and
</p>
<p>without those arrogant prejudices which had im>
</p>
<p>paired the efficiency of many good British officers,
</p>
<p>in the recent war, and of which Sir Jeffrey
</p>
<p>Amherst was a conspicuous example. He had
</p>
<p>acquired a practical knowledge of Indian war-
</p>
<p>fare ; and it is said that, in the course of the
</p>
<p>hazardous partisan service in which he was often
</p>
<p>engaged, when it was necessary to penetrate dark
</p>

<p>defiles and narrow passes, he was sometimes known
</p>
<p>to advance before his men, armed with a rifle, and
</p>
<p>acting the part of a scout. ^
</p>
<p>Sir Jeffrey had long and persistently flattered
</p>
<p>himself that the Indian uprising was but a tempo-
</p>
<p>rary ebullition, which would soon subside. Bou-
</p>
<p>quet sent him, on the fourth of June, a copy of a
</p>
<p>letter from Captain Ecuyer,^ at Fort Pitt, reporting
</p>
<p>the disturbances in that quarter. On the next day
</p>
<p>Bouquet wrote again, in a graver strain ; and Am-
</p>
<p>herst replied, from New York, on the sixth : " I
</p>
<p>gave immediate orders for completing the light
</p>
<p>infantry companies of the 17th, 42d, and 77th reg-
</p>
<p>iments. They are to assemble without loss of time,
</p>
<p>and to encamp on Staten Island, under Major
</p>
<p>Campbell, of the 42d. . . . Although I have
</p>
<p>thought proper to assemble this force, which I
</p>
<p>judge more than sufficient to quell any disturbances
</p>
<p>the whole Indian strength could raise, yet I am
</p>
<p>persuaded the alarm will end in nothing more than
</p>
<p>a rash attempt of what the Senecas have been
</p>
<p>threatening, and which we have heard of for some
</p>
<p>time past. As to their cutting off defenceless fam-
</p>
<p>ilies, or even some of the small posts, it is certainly
</p>
<p>at all times in their power to effect such enter-
</p>
<p>prises. . . . The post of Fort Pitt, or any of the
</p>
<p>others commanded by officers, can certainly never
</p>
<p>be in danger from such a wretched enemy. . . .

</p>
<p>1 am only sorry that when such outrages are com-
</p>
<p>mitted, the guilty should escape ; for I am fully
</p>
<p>convinced the only true method of treating the
</p>
<p>savages is to keep them in proper subjection, and
</p>
<p>punish, Av^ithout exception, the transgressors. . . .
</p>
<p>As I have no sort of dependence on the Assembly
</p>
<p>of Pennsylvania, I have taken such measures as
</p>
<p>will fully enable me to chastise any nation or tribe
</p>
<p>of Indians that dare to commit hostilities on his
</p>
<p>Majesty's subjects. I only wait to hear from you
</p>
<p>what farther steps the savages have taken ; for I
</p>
<p>still think it cannot be any thing general, but the
</p>
<p>rash attempt of that turbulent tribe, the Senecas,
</p>
<p>who richly deserve a severe chastisement from our
</p>
<p>hands, for their treacherous behavior on many
</p>
<p>occasions."
</p>
<p>On receiving this letter. Bouquet immediately
</p>
<p>wrote to Ecuyer at Fort Pitt : " The General has
</p>
<p>taken the necessary measures to " chastise those in-
</p>
<p>famous villains, and defers only to make them feel
</p>
<p>the weight of his resentment till he is better
</p>
<p>informed of their intentions." And having thus
</p>
<p>briefly despatched the business in hand, he pro
</p>
<p>ceeds to touch on the news of the day : "I give
</p>
<p>you joy of the success of our troops at the Manilla,
</p>
<p>\vhere Captain George Ourry hath acquired the two
</p>
<p>best things in this world, glory and money. We
</p>
<p>hear of a great change in the ministry," "etc.
</p>
<p>..." P. S. I have lent three pounds to the ex-
</p>
<p>press. Please to stop it for me. The General

<p>expects that Mr. Croghan will proceed directly to

<p>of this sudden rupture and the intentions of those
</p>
<p>rascals."
</p>
<p>Scarcely had Bouquet sent off the express-rider
</p>
<p>with this letter, when another came from Ecuyer
</p>
<p>with worse reports from the west He forwarded it
</p>
<p>to Amherst, who wrote on receiving it: "I find by
</p>
<p>the intelligence enclosed in your letter that the
</p>
<p>affair of the Indians appears to be more general
</p>
<p>than I had apprehended, although I believe noth-
</p>
<p>ing of what is mentioned regarding the garrison cf
</p>
<p>the Detroit being cut off. It is extremely incon-
</p>
<p>venient at this time ; . . . but I cannot defer send-
</p>
<p>ing you a reinforcement for the communication."
</p>
<p>Accordingly he ordered two companies of the 42d
</p>
<p>and 77th regiments to join Bouquet at Philadelphia.
</p>
<p>" If you think it necessary," he adds, " you will
</p>
<p>yourself proceed to Fort Pitt, that you may be the
</p>
<p>better enabled to put in execution the requisite
</p>
<p>orders for securing the communication and reduc
</p>
<p>ing the Indians to reason."
</p>
<p>Amherst now bestirred himself to put such troops
</p>
<p>as he had into fighting order. The 80th regiment,
</p>
<p>Hopkins's company of Hangers, and a portion of
</p>
<p>the Boyal Americans, were disbanded, and the
</p>
<p>men drafted to complete other broken corps. His
</p>
<p>plan was to push forward as many troops as pos-
</p>
<p>sible to Niagara by way of Oswego, and to Presqu'
</p>
<p>Isle by Avay of Fort Pitt, and thence to send them
</p>
<p>up the lakes to take vengeance on the offending

</p>
<p>proposed to abandon them, and concentrate at Fort
</p>
<p>Pitt and Presqu' Isle ; a movement which, conld it
</p>
<p>have been executed in time, would have saved both
</p>
<p>blood and trouble. But Amherst would not consent.
</p>
<p>" I cannot think," he writes, " of giving them up
</p>
<p>at this time, if w^e can keep them, as such a step
</p>
<p>would give the Indians room to think themselves
</p>
<p>more formidable than they really are ; and it w^ould
</p>
<p>be much better we never attempted to take posts
</p>
<p>in what they call their country, if, upon every alarm,
</p>
<p>we abandon them. ... It remains at present for
</p>
<p>us to take every precaution we can, by which we
</p>
<p>may put a stop, as soon as possible, to their com
</p>
<p>mitting any farther mischief, and to bring them to
</p>
<p>a proper subjection ; for, without that^ I never do
</p>
<p>expect that they will be quiet and orderly, as every
</p>
<p>act of kindness and generosity to those barbarians
</p>
<p>is looked upon as proceeding from our fears."
</p>
<p>Bouquet next writes to report that, with the
</p>
<p>help of the two companies sent him, he has tak(jn
</p>
<p>steps which he hopes will secure the communica
</p>
<p>tion to Fort Pitt and allay the fears of the country
</p>
<p>people, who are deserting their homes in a panic,
</p>
<p>though the enemy has not yet appeared east of the
</p>
<p>mountains. A few days later, on the twenty- third
</p>
<p>of June, Amherst writes, boiling with indignation.
</p>
<p>He had heard from Gladwyn of the investment of
</p>
<p>Detroit, and the murder of Sir Robert Davers
</p>
<p>and Lieutenant Robertson. " The villains after
</p>
<p>this," he says, " had the assurance to come with a

<p>^ipe of Peace ^ desiring admittance into the fort."

<p>who have in so treacherous a way committed any

<p>barbarities on our people, a quick retaliation may

<p>be made without the least exception or hesitation.

<p>I am determined," he continues, " to take every

<p>Two days after, the twenty-fifth of June, he

<p>Three days later the express-rider deliveied the
</p>
<p>truculent letter, from which the above is taken, to
</p>
<p>Amherst at New York. He replied : " Last night I
</p>
<p>received your letter of the twenty- fifth, the contents

<p>of which please me very much,  your sentiments

</p>
<p>Bouquet was now busy on the frontier in prep

<p>arations for pushing forward to Fort Pitt with
</p>
<p>the troops sent him. After reaching the fort,
</p>
<p>w^ith his wagon-trains of ammunition and sup

<p>to Presqu' Isle to wait Amherst's orders for the des-

<p>patch of his troops westward to Detroit, Michilli-

</p>
<p>of which was still unknown. He was encamped

<p>near Carlisle when, on the third of July, he heard

<p>what he styles the " fatal account of the loss of our

</p>
<p>He at once sent the news to Amherst ; who
</p>
<p>thougli he persisted in his original plan of opera-
</p>
<p>tions, became at length coQvinced of the formidable
</p>
<p>nature of the Indian outbreak, and felt bitterly the
</p>
<p>slenf^erness of his own resources. His correspond-
</p>
<p>ence nevertheless, breathes a certain thick-headed,
</p>
<p>blustering arrogance, worthy of the successor of
</p>
<p>Braddock.^ In his contempt for the Indians, he
</p>
<p>finds fault with Captain Ecuyer at Fort Pitt for
</p>
<p>condescending to fire cannon at them, and with
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Blane at Fort Ligonier for burning
</p>
<p>some outhouses, under cover of which " so despic-
</p>
<p>able an enemy " were firing at his garrison. This
</p>
<p>despicable enemy had, however, pushed him to such
</p>
<p>straits that he made, in a postscript to Bouquet, the
</p>
<p>following detestable suggestion : 
</p>
<p>" Could it not be contrived to send the Small
</p>
<p>Fox among those disaffected tribes of Indians'?
</p>
<p>We must on this occasion use every stratagem in
</p>
<p>our power to reduce them."

<p>i The following is a characteristic example. He is w/iting to John-
</p>
<p>son, 27 Aug. 1768 : " I shall only say that it Behoves the Whole Race of
</p>
<p>Indians to Beware (for I Fear the best of them have in some Measure

<p>much farther against the English, or Daring to form Conspiracys ; as the
</p>

<p>the End, will put a most Effectual Stop to their Very Being,"
</p>
<p>The following is his view of the Indians, in a letter to Bouquet,

<p>would have favored the execution of the plan. We hear nothing more of

</p>
<p>There is no direct evidence that Bouquet car-
</p>
<p>ried into effect the shameful plan of infecting the
</p>
<p>Indians though, a few months after, the small-
</p>
<p>pox was known to have made havoc among the
</p>
<p>tribes of the Ohio. Certain it is, that he was
</p>
<p>perfectly capable of dealing with them by other
</p>
<p>means, worthy of a man and a soldier ; and it is
</p>
<p>equally certain, that in relations with civiUzed men
</p>
<p>he was in a high degree honorable, humane, and
</p>
<p>kind.
</p>
<p>with Bouquet. Just before he wrote, he received a letter from one Joim
</p>
<p>Huglies, dated Lancaster, July 11, in which an elaborate plan is laid down
</p>
<p>for conquering the Indians with the help of canine allies.
</p>
<p>The following is the substance of tlie proposal, which is set forth under
</p>
<p>eight distinct heads : 1st, Each soldier to have a dog, which he is to lead
</p>
<p>on the march by a strap three feet long. 2d, All the dogs to be held fast
</p>
<p>by the straps, except one or two on each flank and as many in advance,
</p>
<p>to discover the enemy in ambush. 3d, When you are fired upon, let
</p>
<p>loose all the dogs, which will rush at the concealed Indians, and force
</p>
<p>them in self-defence to expose themselves and fire at their assailants, with
</p>
<p>80 little cliance of hitting them, that, in the words of the letter, " if 1000
</p>
<p>Indians fired on 300 dogs, there would be at least 200 dogs left, besides
</p>
<p>all the soldiers' fires, which must put the Indians to flight very soon.'
</p>
<p>4th, If you come to a swamp, thicket, or the like, " only turn loose 3 or 4
</p>
<p>dogs extraordinary, and you are immediately convinced what you have to
</p>
<p>fear." Oth, " No Indian can well conceal himself in a swamp oi thickei
</p>
<p>as a spy, for y^ dogs will discover him, and may soon be learnt to destroy
</p>
<p>him too." 6th, " The leading the dogs makes them more fierce, and
</p>
<p>keeps them from being tired in running after wild boasts or fighting one
</p>
<p>another." 7tli, Expatiates on the advantages of having the leading-straps
</p>
<p>short. 8th, " The greater the number of dogs, the more fierce they wiU be
</p>
<p>by a great deal, and the more terrible to the Indians ; and if, when you
</p>
<p>get to Bedford, a few scouting parties were sent out with dogs, and one or
</p>
<p>two Indians killed and the dogs put at them to tear them to pieces, you

<p>would soon see the good effects of it ; and I could almost venture my life
</p>
<p>that 500 men with 500 dogs would be much more dreadful to 2000 Indiana

<p>42 THE WAR ON THE BORDERS. [1763, Juli
</p>
<p>The scenes which daily met his eye might welJ
</p>
<p>have moved him to pity as well as indignation
</p>
<p>When he reached Carlisle, at the end of June, he
</p>
<p>found every huilding in the fort, every house,
</p>
<p>barn, and hovel, in the little town, crowded with
</p>
<p>the families of settlers, driven from their homes by
</p>
<p>the terror of the tomahawk. Wives made widows,
</p>
<p>children made orphans, wailed and moaned in
</p>
<p>anguish and despair. On the thirteenth of July
</p>
<p>he wrote to Amherst : " The list of the people
</p>
<p>known to be killed increases very fast every hour.
</p>
<p>The desolation of so many families, reduced to the
</p>
<p>last extremity of w^ant and misery ; the despair of
</p>
<p>those who have lost their parents, relations, and
</p>
<p>friends, with the cries of distracted w^omen and
</p>
<p>children, who fill the streets,  form a scene painful
</p>
<p>to humanity, and impossible to describe." ^ Rage
</p>
<p>alternated with grief. A Mohican and a Cayuga
</p>
<p>Indian, both well known as friendly and peaceable,
</p>
<p>came wdth their squaws and children to claim pro-
</p>
<p>tection from the soldiers. " It was w^ith the utmost
</p>
<p>difficulty," pursues Bouquet, " that I could prevail
</p>
<p>with the enraged multitude not to massacre them.
</p>
<p>I don't think them very safe in the gaol. They
</p>
<p>ought to be removed to Philadelphia."
</p>
<p>Bouquet, on his part, was full of anxieties. On
</p>
<p>the road from Carlisle to Fort Pitt was a chain of
</p>
<p>four or five small forts, of which the most advanced
</p>
<p>find the most exposed were Fort Bedford and Fort
</p>

</p>
<p>Ligonier ; the former commanded by Captain Lewis
</p>
<p>Ourry, and the latter by Lieutenant Archibald
</p>
<p>Blane. These officers kept up a precarious cor-
</p>
<p>respondence with him and each other, by means
</p>
<p>of express-rid jrs, a service dangerous to the last
</p>
<p>degree and soon to become impracticable. It was
</p>
<p>of the utmost importance to hold these posts, which
</p>
<p>contained stores and munitions, the capture of
</p>
<p>which by the Indians would have led to the worst
</p>
<p>consequences. Ourry had no garrison worth the
</p>
<p>name ; but at every Indian alarm the scared inhab-
</p>
<p>itants would desert their farms, and gather for
</p>
<p>shelter around his fort, to disperse again when the
</p>
<p>alarm was over.
</p>
<p>On the third of June, he writes to Bouquet :
</p>
<p>" No less than ninety-three families are now come
</p>
<p>in here for refuge, and more hourly arriving. I
</p>
<p>expect ten more before night." He adds that he
</p>
<p>had formed the men into two militia companies.
</p>
<p>" My returns," he pursues, " amount already to
</p>
<p>a hundred and fifty-five men. My regulars aie
</p>
<p>increased by expresses, etc., to three corporals and
</p>
<p>nnie privates ; no despicable garrison ! "
</p>
<p>On the seventh, he sent another letter. . . . '' As
</p>
<p>to myself, I find I can bear a good deal. Since the
</p>
<p>alarm I never lie down till about twelve, and am
</p>
<p>w^alking about the fort between two and three in
</p>
<p>the morning, turning out the guards and sending
</p>
<p>out patrols, before I suffer the gates to remain
</p>
<p>open. . . . My greatest difficulty is to keep my

<p>militia from straggling by twos and threes to their

</p>
<p>be scalped, and weakening my garrison by such
</p>
<p>numbers absenting themselves. They are still in
</p>
<p>good spirits, but they don't know all the bad news.
</p>
<p>I shall use all means to prevail on them to stay till
</p>
<p>some troops come up. I long to see my Indian
</p>
<p>scouts come in with intelligence; but I long moie
</p>
<p>to hear the Grenadiers' March, and see some more
</p>
<p>red-coats."
</p>
<p>Ten days later, the face of affairs had changed.
</p>
<p>" I am now, as I foresaw, entirely deserted by the
</p>
<p>country people. No accident having happened
</p>
<p>here, they have gradually left me to return to their
</p>
<p>plantations ; so that my whole force is reduced to
</p>
<p>twelve Royal Americans to guard the fort, and seven
</p>
<p>Indian prisoners. I should be very glad to see
</p>
<p>some troops come to my assistance. A fort with
</p>
<p>five bastions cannot be guarded, much less defended,
</p>
<p>by a dozen men ; but I hope God will protect us."
</p>
<p>On the next day, he writes again : " This
</p>
<p>moment I return from the parade. Some scalps
</p>
<p>taken up Dening's Creek yesterday, and to-day some
</p>
<p>families murdered and houses burnt, have restored
</p>
<p>me my militia. . . . Two or three other families
</p>
<p>are missing, and the houses are seen in flames.
</p>
<p>The people are all flocking in again."
</p>
<p>Two days afterwards, he says that, while the
</p>
<p>co(mtrymen were at drill on the parade, three
</p>
<p>Indians attempted to seize two little girls, close to
</p>
<p>the fort, but were driven off by a volley. " This,"
</p>
<p>he pursues, " has added greatly to the panic of the
</p>
<p>people. With difficulty I can restrain them from

</p>
<p>eludes  " I can't help thinking that the enemy will
</p>
<p>collect, after cutting off the little posts one after
</p>
<p>another, leaving Fort Pitt as too tough a morsel,
</p>
<p>and bend their whole force upon the frontiers."
</p>
<p>On the second of July, he describes an attack
</p>
<p>by about twenty Indians on a party of mowers,
</p>
<p>several of whom were killed. " This accident,"
</p>
<p>he says, " has thrown the people into a great con-
</p>
<p>sternation, but such is their stupidity that they will
</p>
<p>do nothing right for their own preservation."
</p>
<p>It was on the next day that he sent a mounted
</p>
<p>soldier to Bouquet with news of the loss of Presqu'
</p>
<p>Isle and its sister posts, which Blane, who had
</p>
<p>received it from Fort Pitt, had contrived to send
</p>
<p>him ; though he himself, in his feeble little fort of
</p>
<p>Ligonier, buried in a sea of forests, hardly dared
</p>
<p>hope to maintain himself. Bouquet was greatly
</p>
<p>moved at the tidings, and his vexation betrayed
</p>
<p>him into injustice towards the defender of Presqu'
</p>
<p>Isle. " Humanity makes me hope that Christie is
</p>
<p>dead, as his scandalous capitulation, for a post of
</p>
<p>that consequence and so impregnable to savages,
</p>
<p>deserves the most severe punishment." ^ He is
</p>
<p>equally vehement in regard to Blane, who appears
</p>
<p>to have intimated, in writing to Ourry, that he had
</p>
<p>himself had thoughts of capitulating, like Christie.

<p>been the reward he would expect, instead of the
</p>
<p>honor he has obtamed by his prudence, courage,
</p>
<p>and resolution. . . . This is a most trying time.
</p>
<p>. . . You may be sure that all the expedition
</p>
<p>possible will be used for the relief of the few
</p>
<p>temaining posts." ^
</p>
<p>As for Blane, the following extracts from his let-
</p>
<p>ters will show his position ; though, when his affairs
</p>
<p>were at the worst, nothing was heard from him, as
</p>
<p>all his messengers were killed. On the fourth of
</p>
<p>June, he writes : " Thursday last my garrison was
</p>
<p>attacked by a body of Indians, about five in the
</p>
<p>morning ; but as they only fired upon us from the
</p>
<p>skirts of the woods, I contented myself with giving
</p>
<p>them three cheers, without spending a single shot
</p>
<p>'<?pon them. But as they still continued their
</p>
<p>v?opping upon the side next the town, I sent the
</p>
<p>'-.ergeant of the Tloyal Americans, with a proper
</p>
<p>detachment, to fire the houses, which effectually
</p>
<p>disappointed them in their plan."
</p>
<p>On the seventeenth, he writes to Bouquet: "I
</p>
<p>hope soon to see yourself, and live in daily hopes
</p>
<p>of a reinforcement. . . . Sunday last, a man strag
</p>
<p>gling out was killed by the Indians ; and Monday

<p>right three of them got under the n house, but

<p>were discovered. The darkness secured them their

</p>
<p>though two expresses have gone from Bedfcrd by
</p>
<p>this post."
</p>
<p>On the twenty-eighth, he explains that he has
</p>
<p>not been able to report for some time, the road
</p>
<p>having been completely closed by the enemy. " On
</p>
<p>the twenty-first," he continues, " the Indians made
</p>
<p>a second attemj)t in a very serious manner, for near
</p>
<p>two liours, but with the like success as the first.
</p>
<p>Tliey began with attempting to cut off the retreat
</p>
<p>of a small party of fifteen men, who, from their
</p>
<p>impatience to come at four Indians who showed
</p>
<p>themselves, in a great measure forced me to let
</p>
<p>them out. In the evening, I think above a hun
</p>
<p>dred lay in ambush by the side of the creek, about
</p>
<p>four hundred yards from the fort; and, just as the
</p>
<p>party was returning pretty near Avhere they lay,
</p>
<p>they rushed out, when they undoubtedly must have
</p>
<p>succeeded, had it not been for a deep morass which
</p>
<p>intervened. Immediately after, they began their
</p>
<p>attack ; and I dare say they fired upwards of one
</p>
<p>thousand shot. Nobody received any damage. So
</p>
<p>far, my good fortune in dangers still attends me."
</p>
<p>And here one cannot but give a moment's thought
</p>
<p>to those whose desperate duty it was to be the bear-
</p>
<p>ers of this correspondence of the officers of the forest
</p>
<p>ntposts with their coiumander. They were usually
</p>
<p>soldiers, sometimes backwoodsmen, and occasionally
</p>
<p>a friendly Indian, who, disguising his attachment to
</p>
<p>the whites, could pass when others would infallibly

<p>have perished. If white men, they were always

<p>excited fancy roamed in nightmare visions of a
</p>
<p>horror but too real and imminent,  such was
</p>
<p>the experience of many an unfortunate who never
</p>
<p>lived to tell it. If the messenger was an Indian,
</p>
<p>his greatest danger was from those who should
</p>
<p>have been his friends. Friendly Indians were told,
</p>
<p>whenever they approached a fort, to make them-
</p>
<p>selves known by carrying green branches thrust
</p>
<p>into the muzzles of their guns ; and an order was
</p>
<p>issued that the token should be respe ted. This
</p>
<p>gave them tolerable security as regarded soldiers,
</p>
<p>but not as regarded the enraged backwoodsmen,

<p>who would shoot without distinction at any thing

<p>Carlisle, urging on his preparations, but met by
</p>
<p>obstacles at every step. Wagons and horses had
</p>
<p>been promised, but promises were broken, and
</p>
<p>all was vexation and delay. The province ot
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania, from causes to be shown hereafter,
</p>
<p>would do nothing to aid the troops who were

<p>defending it ; and even the people of the frontier,

</p>
<p>partly, it seems, from dislike and jealousy of the
</p>
<p>regulars, were backward and sluggish in co-oper-
</p>
<p>ating with them. " I hope," writes Bouquet to Sir
</p>
<p>Jeffrey Amherst, " that we shall be able to save
</p>
<p>that infatuated people from destruction, notwith
</p>
<p>standing all their endeavors to defeat your vigorous
</p>
<p>measures. I meet everywhere with the same back-
</p>
<p>wardness, even among the most exposed of the
</p>
<p>inhabitants, which makes every thing move on
</p>
<p>heavily, and is disgusting to the last degree."
</p>
<p>And again : " I find myself utterly abandoned by
</p>
<p>the very people I am ordered to protect. ... I
</p>
<p>have borne very patiently the ill-usage of this
</p>
<p>province, having still hopes that they will do
</p>
<p>something for us ; and therefore have avoided to
</p>
<p>quarrel with them."
</p>
<p>While, vexed and exasperated. Bouquet labored
</p>
<p>at his thankless task, remonstrated with provincial
</p>
<p>officials, or appealed to refractory farmers, the
</p>
<p>terror of the country people increased every day.
</p>
<p>When on Sunday, the third of July, Ourry's express
</p>
<p>rode into Carlisle with the disastrous news from
</p>
<p>T*resqu' Isle and the other outposts, he stopped
</p>
<p>for a moment in the village street to water his
</p>
<p>horse. A crowd of countrymen were instantly
</p>
<p>about him, besieging him with questions. He told
</p>
<p>his ill-omened story ; and added as, remounting, he
</p>
<p>rode towards Bouquet's tent, " The Indians will
</p>
<p>be here soon." All was now excitement and con
</p>
<p>sternation. Messengers hastened out to spiead tne
</p>
<p>tidings ; and every road and pathway leading into
</p>
<p>Carlisle was beset with the flying settlers, flocking

<p>thither for refuge. Soon rumors were heard that
</p>
<p>the Indians were come. Some of the fugitives had
</p>
<p>seen the smoke of burning houses rising from
</p>
<p>the valleys ; and these reports were fearfully con 
</p>
<p>firmed by the appearance of miserable wretches,
</p>
<p>who, half frantic with grief and dismay, had fled
</p>
<p>from blazing dwellings and slaughtered familiee.
</p>
<p>A party of the inhabitants armed themselves and
</p>
<p>went out, to warn the living and bury the dead.
</p>
<p>Keaching Shearman's Valley, they found fields
</p>
<p>laid waste, stacked wheat on fire, and the houses
</p>
<p>yet in flames ; and they grew sick with horror
</p>
<p>at seeing a group of hogs tearing and devouring
</p>
<p>the bodies of the dead.^ As they advanced up
</p>
<p>the valley, every thing betokened the recent pres-
</p>
<p>ence of the enemy, while columns of smoke, rising
</p>
<p>among the surrounding mountains, showed how
</p>
<p>general was tlie work of destruction.
</p>
<p>On the preceding day, six men, assembled for
</p>
<p>reaping the harvest, had been seated at dinner at
</p>
<p>the house of Campbell, a settler on the Juniata
</p>
<p>Four or five Indians suddenly burst the door, fired
</p>
<p>among them, and then beat down the survivors with
</p>
<p>the butts of their rifles. One young man l(;aped
</p>
<p>from his seat, snatched a gun which stood in a cor-
</p>
<p>ner, discharged it into the breast of the warrior who
</p>
<p>was rushing upon him, and, leaping through an
</p>
<p>open window, made his escape. He fled through
</p>
<p>the forest to a settlement at some distance, where
</p>
<p>he related his story. Upon this, twelve young men
</p>
<p>volunteered to cross the mountain, and warn the

</p>
<p>inhabitants of the neighboring Tuscarora valley.
</p>
<p>On entering it, they found that the enemy had
</p>
<p>been there before them. Some of the houses were
</p>
<p>on tire, while others were still standing, with no
</p>
<p>tenants but the dead. Under the shed of a farmer,
</p>
<p>the Tndians had been feasting on the flesh of the
</p>
<p>cattle tliey had killed, and the meat had not yet
</p>
<p>grown cold. Pursuing their course, the white
</p>
<p>men found the spot where several detached parties
</p>
<p>of the enemy had united almost immediately before ;
</p>
<p>and they boldly resolved to follow, in order to
</p>
<p>ascertain what direction the marauders had taken.
</p>
<p>The trail led them up a deep and woody pass of
</p>
<p>the Tuscarora. Here the yell of the war-whoop
</p>
<p>and the din of fire-arms suddenly greeted them,
</p>
<p>and five of their number were shot down. Thirty
</p>
<p>warriors rose from their ambuscade, and rushed
</p>
<p>upon them. They gave one discharge, scattered,
</p>
<p>and ran for their lives. One of them, a boy named
</p>
<p>Charles Eliot, as he fled, plunging through the
</p>
<p>thickets, heard an Indian tearing the boughs be-
</p>
<p>hind him, in furious pursuit. He seized his pow-
</p>
<p>der-horn, poured the contents at random down the
</p>
<p>muzzle of his gun, threw in a bullet after them,
</p>
<p>vrithout using the ramrod, and, wheeling about,
</p>
<p>disiharged the piece into the breast of his pursuer.
</p>
<p>He saw the Indian shrink back and roll over into
</p>
<p>the bushes. He continued his flight; bat a mo-
</p>
<p>ment after, a voice called his name. Turning to
</p>
<p>the spot, he saw one of his comrades stretched
</p>
<p>helpless upon the ground. This man had been

<p>few rods from the scene of blood, before his strength
</p>
<p>gave out. Eliot approached him. " Take my
</p>
<p>gun," said the dying frontiersman. " Whenever
</p>
<p>you see an Indian, kill him with it, and then I
</p>
<p>shall be satisfied." ^ Eliot, with several others of
</p>
<p>, the party, escaped, and finally reached Carlisle,
</p>
<p>where his story excited a spirit of uncontrollable
</p>
<p>wrath and ven^^eance amonsr the fierce backwoods-
</p>
<p>men. Several parties went out ; and one of them,
</p>
<p>commanded by the sheriff of the place, encountered
</p>
<p>' a band of Indians, routed them after a sharp fight,
</p>
<p>and brought in several scalps.^
</p>
<p>The surrounding country was by this time com-
</p>
<p>pletely abandoned by the settlers, many of whom,
</p>
<p>not content with seeking refuge at Carlisle, con-
</p>
<p>tinued their flight to the eastward, and, headed by
</p>
<p>the clergyman of that place, pushed on to Lancas-
</p>
<p>/ ter, and even to Philadelphia.^ Carlisle presented
</p>
<p>1 Robison, Narrative. Robison was one of the party, and his brother
</p>
<p>was mortally wounded at the first fire.

</p>
<p>THE BATTLE OF BUSHY RUN.
</p>
<p>The miserable multitude were soon threatened
</p>
<p>with famine, and gathered in crowds around the
</p>
<p>tents of Bouquet, begging relief, which he had not
</p>
<p>the heart to refuse. After a delay of eighteen
</p>
<p>days, the chief obstacles were overcome. Wagons
</p>
<p>and draught animals had, little by little, been col-
</p>
<p>lected, and provisions gathered among the settle-
</p>
<p>ments to the eastward. At length all was ready, and
</p>
<p>Bouquet broke up his camp, and began his march.
</p>
<p>The force under his command did not exceed five
</p>
<p>hundred men, of whom the most effective were the
</p>
<p>Highlanders of the 42d regiment. The remnant
</p>
<p>of the 77th, w^hich was also with him, was so
</p>
<p>enfeebled by West Indian exposures, that Amherst
</p>
<p>had at first pronounced it fit only for garrison duty,
</p>
<p>and nothing but necessity had induced him to
</p>
<p>employ it on this arduous service. As the ljet{\'y
</p>
<p>wagons of the convoy lumbered along the street of
</p>
<p>Carlisle, guarded by the bare-legged Highlanders,
</p>
<p>in kilts and plaids, the crowd gazed in anxious
</p>
<p>silence ; for they knew that their all was at stake

<p>v\as little to reassure them in the thin frames and
</p>
<p>haggard look of the worn-out veterans ; still less in
</p>
<p>the sight of sixty invalid soldiers, who, unable to
</p>
<p>walk, were carried in wagons, to furnish a feeble
</p>
<p>reinforcement to the small garrisons along the
</p>
<p>routed The desponding rustics watched the last
</p>
<p>gleam of the bayonets, the last flutter of the tar-
</p>
<p>tans, as the rear files vanished in the woods ; then
</p>
<p>returned to their hovels, prepared for tidings of de-
</p>
<p>feat, and ready, Avhen they heard them, to abandon
</p>
<p>the country, and fly beyond the Susquehanna.
</p>
<p>In truth, the adventure was no boy's play. In
</p>
<p>that gloomy wilderness lay the bones of Braddock
</p>
<p>and the hundreds that perished with him. The
</p>
<p>number of the slain on that bloody day exceeded
</p>
<p>Bouquet's whole force ; w^iile the strength of the
</p>
<p>assailants was inferior to that of the swarms who
</p>
<p>now infested the forests. Bouquet's troops were,
</p>
<p>for the most part, as little accustomed to the back
</p>
<p>woods as those of Braddock ; but their commander
</p>
<p>had served seven years in America, and perfectly
</p>
<p>understood his work. lie had attempted to engage
</p>
<p>a body of frontiersmen to join him on the march ;
</p>
<p>but they preferred to remain for the defence of
</p>
<p>their families. He was therefore forced to employ
</p>
<p>the Highlanders as flankers, to protect his line of
</p>
<p>march and prevent surprise ; but, singularly enough,
</p>
<p>these mountaineers were sure to lose themselves in
</p>
<p>the woods, and therefore proved useless.^ For a

<p>few days, however, his progress would be tolerably

<p>Becure, at least from serious attack. His anxieties
</p>
<p>centred on Fort Ligonier, and he resolved to
</p>
<p>hazard the attempt to throw a reinforcement into
</p>
<p>it. Thirty of the best Highlanders were chosen,
</p>
<p>furnished with guides, and ordered to push forward
</p>
<p>with the utmost speed, avoiding the road, travelling
</p>
<p>by night on unfrequented paths, and lying close
</p>
<p>by day. The attempt succeeded. After resting
</p>
<p>several days at Bedford, where Ourry was expecting
</p>
<p>an attack, they again set out, found Fort Ligonier
</p>
<p>beset by Indians, and received a volley as they
</p>
<p>made for the gate ; but entered safely, to the
</p>
<p>uns})eakable relief of Bh\ne and his beleaguered
</p>
<p>men.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bouquet's little army crept on its slow
</p>
<p>way along the Cumberland valley. Passing here
</p>
<p>and there a few scattered cabins, deserted or burnt
</p>
<p>to the ground, they reached the hamlet of Ship-
</p>
<p>pensburg. somewhat more than twenty miles from
</p>
<p>their point of departure. Here, as at Carlisle, was
</p>
<p>gathered a starving multitude, who had fled from
</p>
<p>the knife and the tomahawk.^ Beyond lay a soli-
</p>
<p>tude whence every settler had tied. They reached

<p>Far on their right stretched the green ridges of
</p>
<p>the Tuscarora ; and, in front, mountain beyond
</p>
<p>mountain was piled against the sky. Over rocky
</p>
<p>heights and through deep valleys, they reached at
</p>
<p>length Fort Littleton, a provincial post, m which,
</p>
<p>with incredible perversity, the government of Penn-
</p>
<p>sylvania had refused to place a garrison.^ Not far
</p>
<p>distant was the feeble little post of the Juniata,
</p>
<p>empty like the other ; for the two or three men
</p>
<p>who held it had been withdrawn by Ourry.^ On the
</p>
<p>twenty-fifth of July, they reached Bedford, hemmed
</p>
<p>in by encircling mountains. It was the frontier
</p>
<p>village and the centre of a scattered border popu-
</p>
<p>lation, the whole of which was now clustered in
</p>
<p>terror in and around the fort ; for the neighbor
</p>
<p>ing woods were full of prowling savages. Ourry
</p>
<p>reported that for several weeks nothing had been
</p>
<p>heard from the westward, every messenger having
</p>
<p>been killed and the communication completely cut
</p>
<p>off. By the last intelligence Fort Pitt had been
</p>
<p>surrounded by Indians, and daily threatened with
</p>
<p>a general attack.
</p>
<p>At Bedford, Bouquet had the good fortune to
</p>
<p>engage thirty backwoodsmen to accompany him.'

</p>
<p>He lay encamped three days to rest men and
</p>
<p>animals, and then, leaving his invalids to garrison
</p>
<p>the fort, put out again into the sea of savage
</p>
<p>verdure that stretched beyond. The troops and
</p>
<p>convoy defiled along the road made by General
</p>
<p>Forbes in 1758, if the name of road can be given
</p>
<p>to a rugged track, hewn out by axemen through
</p>
<p>forests and swamps and up the steep acclivities of
</p>
<p>rugged mountains ; shut in between impervious
</p>
<p>walls of trunks, boughs, and matted thickets, and
</p>
<p>overarched by a canopy of restless leaves. With
</p>
<p>difficulty and toil, the wagons dragged slowly on,
</p>
<p>by hill and hollow, through brook and quagmire,
</p>
<p>over roots, rocks, and stumps. Nature had formed
</p>
<p>the country for a war of ambuscades and surprises,
</p>
<p>and no pains were spared to guard against them.
</p>
<p>A band of backwoodsmen led the way, followed
</p>
<p>closely by the pioneers ; the wagons and the cattle
</p>
<p>were in the centre, guarded by the regulars ; and a
</p>
<p>rear guard of backwoodsmen closed the line of
</p>
<p>march. Frontier riflemen scoured the woods far in
</p>
<p>front and on either flank, and made surprise impos
</p>
<p>sible. Thus they toiled heavily on till the main
</p>
<p>ridge of the Alleghanies, a mighty wall of green,
</p>
<p>rose up before them ; and they began their zigzag
</p>
<p>progress up the woody heights amid the sweltering
</p>
<p>heats of July. The tongues of the panting oxen
</p>
<p>hung lolling from their jaws ; v^hile the pine-trees,
</p>
<p>scorching in the hot sun, diffused their resinous
</p>
<p>the road, and cannot on that account be employed as Flankers, I have
</p>
<p>commissioned a person here to procure me about thirty woodsmen to
</p>
<p>march with us. . . . This is very irt-egular, but the circumstances rendei

<p>odors throiigli the snltrv air. At length from the
</p>
<p>windy summit the Highhand soldiers could gaze
</p>
<p>around upon a boundless panorama of forest-cov-
</p>
<p>ered mountains, wilder than their own native hills.
</p>
<p>Descending from the Alleghanies, they entered
</p>
<p>upon a country less rugged and formidable in ilself,
</p>
<p>but beset with constantly increasing dangers. On
</p>
<p>the second of August, they reached Fort Ligonier,
</p>
<p>about fifty miles from Bedford, and a hundred and
</p>
<p>fifty from Carlisle. The Indians who were about
</p>
<p>the place vanished at their approach ; but the gar-
</p>
<p>rison could furnish no intelligence of the motions
</p>
<p>and designs of the enemy, having been completely
</p>
<p>blockaded for weeks. In this uncertainty, Bouquet
</p>
<p>resolved co leave behind the oxen and wagons,
</p>
<p>which formed the most cumbrous part of the con-
</p>
<p>voy, in order to advance with greater celerity, and
</p>
<p>oppose a better resistance in case of attack. Thus
</p>
<p>relieved, the army resumed its march on the fourth,
</p>
<p>taking with them three hundred and fifty  pack
</p>
<p>horses and a few cattle, and at nightfall encamped
</p>
<p>at no great distance from Ligonier. Within less
</p>
<p>than a day's march in advance lay the dangerous
</p>
<p>defiles of Turtle Creek, a stream flowing at the
</p>
<p>bottom of a deep hollow, flanked by steep declivi
</p>
<p>ties, along the foot of which the road at that time
</p>
<p>ran for some distance. Fearing that the enemy
</p>
<p>would lay an ambuscade at this place, Bouquet
</p>
<p>resolved to march on the following day as far as a
</p>
<p>small stream called Bushy Run ; to rest here until
</p>
<p>night, and then, by a forced march, to cross Turtle

</p>
<p>1768, Auo.] UNEXECTED ATTACK. 61
</p>
<p>On tbe morning of the fifth, the tents were struck
</p>
<p>at an early hour, and the troops began their march
</p>
<p>through a country broken with hills and deep hol-
</p>
<p>lows, covered with the tall, dense forest, which
</p>
<p>spread for countless leagues around. By one
</p>
<p>o'clock, they had advanced seventeen miles ; and
</p>
<p>the guides assured them that they were within half
</p>
<p>a mile of Bushy Eun, their proposed resting-place.
</p>
<p>The tired soldiers were pressing forward with
</p>
<p>renewed alacrity, when suddenly the report of
</p>
<p>rifles from the front sent a thrill along the ranks ;
</p>
<p>and, as they listened, the firing thickened into a
</p>
<p>fierce, sharp rattle ; while shouts and whoops, dead
</p>
<p>ened by the intervening forest, showed that the
</p>
<p>advance guard was hotly engaged. The two fore
</p>
<p>most companies were at once ordered forward to
</p>
<p>support it ; but, far from abating, the fii*e grew so
</p>
<p>rapid and furious as to argue the presence of an
</p>
<p>enemy at once numerous and resolute. At this,
</p>
<p>the convoy was halted, the troops formed into line,
</p>
<p>and a general charge ordered. Bearing down
</p>
<p>through the forest with fixed bayonets, they drove
</p>
<p>the yelping assailants before them, and swept the
</p>
<p>ground clear. But at the very moment of suc-
</p>
<p>cess, a fresh burst of whoops and firing was heard
</p>
<p>from either flank ; while a confused noise from the
</p>
<p>rear showed that the convoy was attacked. It was
</p>
<p>necessary instantly to fall back for its support.
</p>
<p>Driving ofi" the assailants, the troops formed in a
</p>
<p>circle around the crowded and terrified horses.

<p>yelling resounded on every side, were concealed by
</p>
<p>the thick forest, yet no man lost his composure ;
</p>
<p>and all displayed a steadiness which nothing but
</p>
<p>implicit confidence in their commander could have
</p>
<p>inspired. And now ensued a combat of a nature
</p>
<p>most harassing and discouraging. Again and
</p>
<p>again, now on this side and now on that, a crowd
</p>
<p>of Indians rushed up, pouring in a heavy fire, and
</p>
<p>striving, with furious outcries, to break into the
</p>
<p>circle. A well-directed volley met them, followed
</p>
<p>by a steady charge of the bayonet. They never
</p>
<p>waited an instant to receive the attack, but, leaping
</p>
<p>backw^ards from tree to tree, soon vanished from
</p>
<p>sight, only to renew their attack with unabated
</p>
<p>ferocity in another quarter. Such was their activity,
</p>
<p>that very few of them were hurt ; Avhile the British,
</p>
<p>less expert in bush-fighting, suffered severely.
</p>
<p>Thus the fight went on, without intermission, for
</p>
<p>seven hours, until the forest grew dark with
</p>
<p>approaching night. Upon this, the Indians grad
</p>
<p>ually slackened their fire, and the exhausted sol-
</p>
<p>diers found time to rest.
</p>
<p>It was impossible to change their ground in the
</p>
<p>enemy's presence, and the troops were obliged to
</p>
<p>encamp upon the hill where the combat had taken
</p>
<p>place, though not a drop of water was to be found
</p>
<p>ihere. Fearing a night attack. Bouquet stationed
</p>
<p>numerous sentinels and outposts to guard against

<p>^76^, ArG.j DISTRESS OF THE TKOOPS. 63
</p>
<p>of the morrow, wrote to Sir Jeffrey Amlierst, in a
</p>
<p>few clear, concise words, an account of the clay's
</p>
<p>events. His letter concludes as follows : " What-
</p>
<p>ever our fate may be, I thought it necessary to give
</p>
<p>your Excellency this early information, that you
</p>
<p>may, at all events, take such measures as you wiU
</p>
<p>think proper with the provinces, for their owi:
</p>
<p>Fafety, and the eifectual relief of Fort Pitt ; as, in
</p>
<p>case of another engagement, I fear insurmountable
</p>
<p>difficulties in protecting and transporting our pro-
</p>
<p>visions, being already so much weakened by the
</p>
<p>losses of this day, in men and horses, besides the
</p>
<p>additional necessity of carrying the wounded, whose
</p>
<p>situation is truly deplorable."
</p>
<p>The condition of these unhappy men might well
</p>
<p>awaken sympathy. About sixty soldiers, besides
</p>
<p>several officers, had been killed or disabled. A
</p>
<p>space in the centre of the camp was prepared for
</p>
<p>the reception of the wounded, and surrounded by
</p>
<p>a wall of flour-bags from the convoy, affording some
</p>
<p>protection against the bullets which flew from all
</p>
<p>sides during the fight. Here they lay upon the
</p>
<p>ground, enduring agonies of thirst, and waiting,
</p>
<p>passive and helpless, the issue of the battle. De-
</p>
<p>prived of the animating thought that their ives
</p>
<p>and safety depended on their own exertions ; sur-
</p>
<p>lounded by a wilderness, and by scenes to the
</p>
<p>horror of which no degree of familiarity could
</p>
<p>render the imagination callous, they must have
</p>
<p>endured mental sufferings, compared to which the
</p>
<p>pain of their wounds was slight. In the prob-

</p>
<p>awaited them ; while even victory would not ensure
</p>
<p>their safety, since any great increase in their num-
</p>
<p>bers would render it impossible for their comrades
</p>
<p>to transport them. Nor was the condition of those
</p>
<p>who had hitherto escaped an enviable one. Though
</p>
<p>they were about equal in number to their assailants,
</p>
<p>yet the dexterity and alertness of the Indians,
</p>
<p>joined to the nature of the country, gave all the
</p>
<p>advantages of a greatly superior force. The enemy
</p>
<p>were, moreover, exulting in the fullest confidence
</p>
<p>of success ; for it was in these very forests that,
</p>
<p>eight years before, they had nearly destroyed twice
</p>
<p>their number of the best British troops. Through-
</p>
<p>out the earlier part of the night, they kept up a
</p>
<p>dropping fire upon the camp ; while, at short inter-
</p>
<p>vals, a wild w^hoop from the thick surrounding
</p>
<p>gloom told with what fierce eagerness they w^aited
</p>
<p>to glut their vengeance on the morrow. The camp
</p>
<p>remained in darkness, for it would have been dan-
</p>
<p>gerous to build fires within its precincts, to direct
</p>
<p>the aim of the lurking marksmen. Surrounded by
</p>
<p>such terrors, the men snatched a disturbed and
</p>
<p>broken sleep, recruiting their exhausted strength
</p>
<p>"or the renewed struggle of the morning.
</p>
<p>With the earliest daAvn of day, and while the
</p>
<p>(lamp, cool forest was still involved in twilight,
</p>
<p>there rose around the camp a general burst of those
</p>
<p>horrible cries which form the ordinary prelude of
</p>
<p>an Indian battle. Instantly, from every side at
</p>
<p>once, the enemy opened their fire, approaching
</p>
<p>under cover of the trees and bushes, and levelling

</p>
<p>with a close and deadly aim. Often, as on the pre-
</p>
<p>1763, Aug. I SECOND DAY'S CONFLICT. 6h
</p>
<p>vious day, they would rush up with furious impet-
</p>
<p>uosity, striving to break into the ring of troops.
</p>
<p>They were repulsed at every point ; but the British,
</p>
<p>though constantly victorious, were beset with undi
</p>
<p>minished perils, while the violence of the enemy
</p>
<p>seemed every moment on the increase. True to
</p>
<p>their favorite tactics, they would never stand their
</p>
<p>ground when attacked, but vanish at the first gleam
</p>
<p>of the levelled bayonet, only to appear again the
</p>
<p>moment the danger was past. The troops, fatigued
</p>
<p>by the long march and equally long battle of the
</p>
<p>previous day, were maddened by the torments of
</p>
<p>thirst, " more intolerable," says their commander,
</p>
<p>" than the enemy's fire." They were fully con-
</p>
<p>scious of the peril in which they stood, of wasting
</p>
<p>away by slow degrees beneath the shot of assailants
</p>
<p>at once so daring, so cautious, and so active, and
</p>
<p>upon whom it was impossible to inflict any decisive
</p>
<p>injury. The Indians saw their distress, and pressed
</p>
<p>them closer and closer, redoubling their yells and
</p>
<p>bowlings ; while some of them, sheltered behind
</p>
<p>trees, assailed the troops, in bad English, with
</p>
<p>abuse and derision.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the interior of the camp was a scene
</p>
<p>of confusion. The horses, secured in a crowd near
</p>
<p>the wall of flour-bags which covered the wounded,
</p>
<p>were often struck by the bullets, and wrought to
</p>
<p>the height of terror by the mingled din of whoops,
</p>
<p>shrieks, and firing. They would break away by
</p>
<p>half scores at a time, burst through the ring of
</p>
<p>troops and the outer circle of assailants, and scour
</p>
<p>madly up and down the hill-sides ; while many of

</p>
<p>the drivers, overcome by the terrors of a scene in
</p>
<p>which they could bear no active part, hid them-
</p>
<p>selves among the bushes, and could neither hear
</p>
<p>nor obey orders.
</p>
<p>It was now about ten o'clock. Oppressed with
</p>
<p>lieat, fatigue, and thirst, the distressed troops still
</p>
<p>maintained a weary and wavering defence, encir
</p>
<p>cling the convoy in a yet unbroken ring. They
</p>
<p>were fast falling in their ranks, and the strength
</p>
<p>and spirits of the survivors had begun to flag. If
</p>
<p>the fortunes of the day were to be retrieved, the
</p>
<p>effort must be made at once ; and happily the mind
</p>
<p>of the commander was equal to the emergency.
</p>
<p>In the midst of the confusion he conceived a mas-
</p>
<p>terly stratagem. Could the Indians be brought
</p>
<p>together in a body, and made to stand their ground
</p>
<p>w^hen attacked, there could be little doubt of the
</p>
<p>result ; and, to effect this object. Bouquet determined
</p>
<p>to increase their confidence, which had already
</p>
<p>mounted to an audacious pitch. Two companies
</p>
<p>of infantry, forming a part of the ring which had
</p>
<p>been exposed to the hottest fire, w^ere ordered to
</p>
<p>fall back into the interior of the camp ; while the
</p>
<p>troops on either hand joined their files across the
</p>
<p>vacant space, as if to cover the retreat of their
</p>
<p>comrades. These orders, given at a favorable mo*
</p>
<p>ment, were executed with great promptness. The
</p>
<p>thin line of troops who took possession of the
</p>
<p>deserted part of the circle were, from their small
</p>
<p>numbers, brought closer in towards the centre.
</p>
<p>The Indians mistook these movements for a retreat.

<p>Confident that their time was come, they leaped up

</p>
<p>on all sides, from behind the trees and bushes, and
</p>
<p>with infernal screeches, rushed headlong to^vards
</p>
<p>the spot, pouring in a heavy and galling fire. The
</p>
<p>shock was too violent to be long endured. The
</p>
<p>men struggled to maintain their posts ; but the
</p>
<p>Indians seemed on the point of breaking into the
</p>
<p>heart of the camp, when the aspect of affairs was
</p>
<p>suddenly reversed. The two companies, who had
</p>
<p>apparently abandoned their position, were in fact
</p>
<p>destined to begin the attack ; and they now sallied
</p>
<p>out from the circle at a point where a depression
</p>
<p>in the ground, joined to the thick growth of trees,
</p>
<p>concealed them from the eves of the Indians. Mak-
</p>
<p>ing a short detour through the woods, they came
</p>
<p>round upon the flank of the furious assailants, and
</p>
<p>fired a close volley into the midst of the crowd.
</p>
<p>Numbers were seen to fall ; yet though completely
</p>
<p>surprised, and utterly at a loss to understand the
</p>
<p>nature of the attack, the Indians faced about w^ith
</p>
<p>the greatest intrepidity, and returned the fire. But
</p>
<p>the Highlanders, with yells as wild as their own,
</p>
<p>fell on tliiem with the bayonet. The shock was
</p>
<p>irresistible, and they fled before the charging ranks
</p>
<p>in a tumuUuous throng. Orders had been given
</p>
<p>to two other companies, occupying a contiguous
</p>
<p>part of the circle, to support the attack whenever
</p>
<p>a favorable moment should occur ; and they had
</p>
<p>therefore advanced a little from their position, and
</p>
<p>lay close crouched in ambush. The fugitives,
</p>
<p>pressed by the Highland bayonets, passed directly
</p>
<p>across their front ; upon which they rose, and poured

<p>among them a second volley, no less destructive

</p>
<p>than the first. This completed the rout. The
</p>
<p>four companies, uniting, drove the flying savages
</p>
<p>through the woods, giving them no time to rally
</p>
<p>or reload their empty rifles, killing many, and
</p>
<p>scattering the rest in hopeless confusion.
</p>
<p>While this took place at one part of the circle,
</p>
<p>the troops and the savages had still maintained their
</p>
<p>respective positions at the other ; but when the
</p>
<p>latter perceived the total rout of their comrades,
</p>
<p>and saw the troops advancing to assail them, they
</p>
<p>also lost heart, and fled. The discordant outcries
</p>
<p>which had so long deafened the ears of the English
</p>
<p>soon ceased altogether, and not a living Indian
</p>
<p>remained near the spot. About sixty corpses lay
</p>
<p>scattered over the ground. Among them were
</p>
<p>found those of several prominent chiefs, while the
</p>
<p>blood which stained the leaves of the bushes showed
</p>
<p>that numbers had fled wounded from the field.
</p>
<p>The soldiers took but one prisoner, whom they shot
</p>
<p>to death like a captive wolf. The loss of the Brit
</p>
<p>ish in the two battles surpassed that of the enemy,
</p>
<p>amounting to eight officers and one hundred and

<p>fifteen men.^

<p>" As you will probably have the Accounts of these Engagements from
</p>
<p>the Gentlemen that were in them, I shall say no more than this, that it
</p>
<p>is the general Opinion, the Troops behaved with the utmost Intrepidity,
</p>
<p>and the Indians were never known to behave so fiercely. You may be
</p>
<p>sure the Sight of the Troops was very agreeable to our poor Garrison,
</p>
<p>being penned up in the Fort from the 27th of May to the 9th Instant, and

<p>and the Indians had displayed throughout a fieice-
</p>
<p>ness and intrepidity matched only by the steady
</p>
<p>valor with which they were met. In the provinces,
</p>
<p>the victory excited equal joy and admiration, espe-
</p>
<p>cially among those who knew the incalculable
</p>
<p>diihculties of an Indian campaign. The Assembly
</p>
<p>of Pennsylvania passed a vote expressing their sense
</p>
<p>of the merits of Bouquet, and of the service he
</p>
<p>had rendered to the province. He soon after

<p>received the additional honor of the formal thanks

<p>of the King.^
</p>
<p>In many an Indian village, the women cut away
</p>
<p>their hair, gashed their limbs with knives, and
</p>
<p>uttered their dismal bowlings of lamentation for
</p>
<p>the fallen. Yet, though surprised and dispirited,
</p>
<p>the rage of the Indians was too deep to be quenched,
</p>
<p>even by so signal a reverse ; and their outrages upon
</p>
<p>the frontier were resumed with unabated ferocity.
</p>
<p>Fort Pitt, however, was effectually relieved ; while
</p>
<p>the moral effect of the victory enabled the frontier
</p>
<p>settlers to encounter the enemy with a spirit which

</p>
<p>While Bouquet was fighting the battle of Bushy
</p>
<p>Run, and Dalzell making his fatal sortie against
</p>
<p>Hie camp of Pontiac, Sir William Johnson was
</p>
<p>engaged in the more pacific yet more important
</p>
<p>task of securing the friendship and alliance of the
</p>
<p>Six Nations. After several preliminary confer-
</p>
<p>ences, he sent runners throughout the whole con-
</p>
<p>federacy to invite deputies of the several tribes to
</p>
<p>meet him in council at Johnson Hall. The request
</p>
<p>was not declined. From the banks of the Mohawk ;
</p>
<p>from the Oneida, Cayuga, and Tuscarora villages ;
</p>
<p>from the valley of Onondaga, where, from imme-
</p>
<p>morial time, had burned the great council-fire of
</p>
<p>the confederacy,  came chiefs and warriors, gath-
</p>
<p>ering to the place of meeting. The Senecas alone,
</p>
<p>the warlike tenants of the Genesee valley, refused
</p>
<p>to attend ; for they were already in arms against the
</p>
<p>English. Besides the Iroquois, deputies came from
</p>
<p>the tribes dwelling along the St. Lawrence, and
</p>
<p>within the settled parts of Canada.
</p>
<p>The council opened on the seventh of Septem-
</p>
<p>ber. Despite their fair words, their attachment
</p>
<p>was doubtful ; but Sir William Johnson, by a dex-

</p>
<p>allayed their discontent, and banished the thoughts
</p>
<p>of war. They winced, however, when he informed
</p>
<p>them that, during the next season, an English army
</p>
<p>must pass through their country, on its way to
</p>
<p>punish the refractory tribes of the West. '' Your
</p>
<p>foot is broad and heavy," said the speaker from
</p>
<p>Onondaga ; " take care that you do not tread on
</p>
<p>us." Seeing the improved temper of his auditory,
</p>
<p>Johnson was led to hope for some farther advan-
</p>
<p>tage than that of mere neutrality. He accordingly
</p>
<p>urged the Iroquois to take up arms against the
</p>
<p>hostile tribes, and concluded his final harangue
</p>
<p>with the following figurative words : " I now
</p>
<p>deliver you a good English axe, which I desire
</p>
<p>you will give to the warriors of all your nations,
</p>
<p>with directions to use it against these covenant-
</p>
<p>breakers, by cutting off the bad links which have
</p>
<p>sullied the chain of friendship."
</p>
<p>These words were confirmed by the presentation
</p>
<p>of a black war-belt of wamjDum, and the offer of a
</p>
<p>hatchet, which the Iroquois did not refuse to accept.
</p>
<p>That they would take any very active and strenuous
</p>
<p>part in the war, could not be expected ; yet their
</p>
<p>bearing arms at all would prove of great advan-
</p>
<p>tage, by discouraging the hostile Indians who had
</p>
<p>looked upon the Iroquois as friends and abettors.
</p>
<p>Some months after the council, several small par-
</p>
<p>ties actually took the field ; and, being stimulated
</p>
<p>by the prospect of reward, brought in a consider
</p>
<p>able number of scalps and prisoners.^

<p>Hall, Sept 1763. Letters of Sir Wiiliam Johnson.
</p>
<p>14: THE IROQUOIS. |1763, Sbpt
</p>
<p>/ Upon the persuasion of Sir William Johnson,
</p>
<p>the tribes of Canada were induced to send a mes-
</p>
<p>sage to the western Indians, exhorting them to
</p>
<p>bury the hatchet, while the Iroquois despatched an
</p>
<p>embassy of similar import to the Delawares on the
</p>
<p>Susquehanna. " Cousins the Delawares, "  thus
</p>
<p>ran the message,  " we have heard that many wild
</p>
<p>Indians in the West, who have tails like bears, have
</p>
<p>let fall the chain of friendship, and taken up the
</p>
<p>hatchet against our brethren the English. We
</p>
<p>desire you to hold fast the chain, and shut your
</p>
<p>ears against their words." ^
</p>
<p>In spite of the friendly disposition to which the
</p>
<p>Iroquois had been brought, the province of New
</p>
<p>York suffered not a little from the attacks of the
</p>
<p>hostile tribes who ravaged the borders of Ulster,
</p>
<p>Orange, and Albany counties, and threatened to
</p>
<p>destroy the upper settlements of the Mohawk.^
</p>
<p>Sir AVilliam Johnson was the object of their espe-
</p>
<p>cial enmity, and he several times received intimations
</p>
<p>that he was about to be attacked. He armed his
</p>
<p>tenantry, surrounded his seat of Johnson Hall with

</p>
<p>a stockade, and garrisoned it with a party of sol-
</p>
<p>diers, which Su' Jeffrey Amherst had ordered
</p>
<p>thither for his protection.
</p>
<p>About this time, a singular incident occurred
</p>
<p>near the town of Goshen. Four or five men went
</p>
<p>out among the hills to shoot partridges, and, chanc-
</p>
<p>ing to raise a large covey, they all fired their gung
</p>
<p>at nearly the same moment. The timorous inhabi-
</p>
<p>tants, hearing the reports, supposed that they came
</p>
<p>from an Indian war-party, and instantly fled in
</p>
<p>dismay, spreading the alarm as they went. The
</p>
<p>neighboring country was soon in a panic. The
</p>
<p>farmers cut the harness of their horses, and, leaving
</p>
<p>their carts and ploughs behind, galloped for their
</p>
<p>lives. Others, snatching up their children and
</p>
<p>their most valuable property, made with all speed
</p>
<p>for New England, not daring to pause until they
</p>
<p>had crossed the Hudson. For several days the
</p>
<p>neighborhood was abandoned, five hundred families
</p>
<p>having left their habitations and fled.^ Not long
</p>
<p>after this absurd affair, an event occurred of a widely
</p>
<p>different character. Allusion has before been made
</p>
<p>to the carrying-place of Niagara, which formed an
</p>
<p>essential link in the chain of communication be-
</p>
<p>tween the province of New York and the interior
</p>
<p>country. Men and military stores were conveyed
</p>
<p>in boats up the River Niagara, as far as the present
</p>
<p>site of Lewiston. Thence a portage road, several
</p>
<p>miles in length, passed along the banks of the
</p>
<p>stream, and terminated at Fort Schlosser, above the
</p>
<p>cataract. This road traversed a region whose sub-

</p>
<p>lime features have gained for it a world-wide renown.
</p>
<p>The River Niagara, a short distance helow the cat-
</p>
<p>aract, assumes an aspect scarcely less remarkable
</p>
<p>than that stupendous scene itself. Its channel is
</p>
<p>formed by a vast ravine, whose sides, now bare and
</p>
<p>weather-stained, now shaggy with forest-trees, rise
</p>
<p>in cliffs of appalling height and steepness. Along
</p>
<p>this cliasm pour all the waters of the lakes, heaving
</p>
<p>their furious surges with the power of an ocean
</p>
<p>and the rage of a mountain torrent. About three
</p>
<p>miles below the cataract, the precipices which
</p>
<p>form the eastern wall of the ravine are broken
</p>
<p>by an abyss of awful depth and blackness, bearing
</p>
<p>at the present day the name of the Devil's Hole.
</p>
<p>In its shallowest part, the precipice sinks sheer
</p>
<p>down to the depth of eighty feet, where it meets a
</p>
<p>chaotic mass of rocks, descending with an abrupt
</p>
<p>declivity to unseen depths below. Within the cold
</p>
<p>and damp recesses of the gulf, a host of forest-
</p>
<p>trees have rooted themselves ; and, standing on the
</p>
<p>perilous brink, one may look down upon the min-
</p>
<p>gled foliage of ash, poplar, and maple, while, above
</p>
<p>them all, the spruce and hr shoot their sharp and
</p>
<p>rigid spires upward into sunlight. The roar of the
</p>
<p>convulsed river swells heavily on the ear ; and, far
</p>
<p>beloWj its headlong waters, careering in foam, may
</p>
<p>be discerned through the openings of the matted
</p>
<p>foliage.
</p>

</p>
<p>train of wagons and pack-horses proceeded from

</p>
<p>an escort of twenty-four soldiers. They pursued
</p>
<p>their slow progress until they reached a point
</p>
<p>where the road passed along the brink of the
</p>
<p>Devil's Hole. The gulf yawned on their left,
</p>
<p>while on their right the road w^as skirted by low
</p>
<p>densely wooded hills. Suddenly they were greeted
</p>
<p>by the blaze and clatter of a hundred rifles. Then
</p>
<p>followed the startled cries of men, and the bound-
</p>
<p>ing of maddened horses. At the next instant, a
</p>
<p>host of Indians broke screeching from the woods,
</p>
<p>and rifle-butt and tomahawk flnished the bloody
</p>
<p>work. All was over in a moment. Horses leaped
</p>
<p>the precipice ; men were driven shrieking into the
</p>
<p>abyss ; teams and wagons went over, crashing to
</p>
<p>atoms among the rocks below^ Tradition relates
</p>
<p>that the drummer-boy of the detachment wag
</p>
<p>caught, in his fall, among the branches of a tree,
</p>
<p>where he hung suspended by his drum-strap.
</p>
<p>Being but slightly injured, he disengaged himself,
</p>
<p>and, hiding in the recesses of the gulf, finally
</p>
<p>escaped. One of the teamsters also, who was
</p>
<p>wounded at the first fire, contrived to crawl into
</p>
<p>the woods, where he lay concealed till the Indians
</p>
<p>had left the place. Besides these two, the only sur-
</p>
<p>vivor was Stedman, the conductor of the convoy ;
</p>
<p>who, being well mounted, and seeing the whole
</p>
<p>j)arty forced helpless towards the precipice, wheeled
</p>
<p>his horse, and resolutely spurred through the crowd
</p>
<p>of Indians. One of them, it is said, seized his

<p>bridle ; but he freed himself by a dexterous use of

<p>by the bullets which whistled about his head. Fly
</p>
<p>ing at fall speed through the forest, he reached
</p>
<p>Fort Schlosser in safety.
</p>
<p>The distant sound of the Indian rifles had been
</p>
<p>heard by a party of soldiers, who occupied a smali
</p>
<p>fortified camp near the lower landing. Forming in
</p>
<p>haste, they advanced eagerly to the rescue. In an-
</p>
<p>ticipation of this movement, the Indians, who were
</p>
<p>nearly five hundred in number, had separated into
</p>
<p>two parties, one of which had stationed itself at
</p>
<p>the Devil's Hole, to waylay the convoy, while the
</p>
<p>other formed an ambuscade upon the road, a mile
</p>
<p>nearer the landing-place. The soldiers, marching
</p>
<p>precipitately, and huddled in a close body, were sud-
</p>
<p>denly assailed by a volley of rifles, which stretched
</p>
<p>half their number dead upon the road. Then,
</p>
<p>rushing from the forest, the Indians cut down the
</p>
<p>survivors with merciless ferocity. A small remnant
</p>
<p>only escaped the massacre, and fled to Fort Niag-
</p>
<p>ara with the tidings. Major Wilkins, who com-
</p>
<p>manded at this post, lost no time in marching to
</p>
<p>the spot, with nearly the whole strength of his
</p>
<p>garrison. Not an Indian was to be found. At the
</p>
<p>two places of ambuscade, about seventy dead bodies
</p>
<p>were counted, naked, scalpless, and so horribly
</p>
<p>mangled that many of them could not be recog-
</p>
<p>nized. All the wagons had been broken to pieces,
</p>
<p>and such of the horses as were not driven over the

<p>precipice had been carried ofl", laden, doubtless,

<p>The Seneca warriors, aided probably by some of

<p>and three Subalterns, marched with about 80 Men, mostly of Gage's Light

<p>briskly upon them, but was instantly surrounded, and the Captain who

<p>commanded mortally wounded the first Fire ; the 3 Subalterns also were

<p>soon after killed, on which a general Confusion ensued. The Indians

<p>rushed in on all Sides and cut about 60 or 70 Men in Pieces, including the

<p>CHAPTER XXII.
</p>
<p>1763.
</p>
<p>DESOLATION OF THE FRONTIERS.
</p>
<p>The advancing frontiers of American civilization
</p>
<p>have always nurtured a class of men of striking
</p>
<p>and peculiar character. The best examples of this
</p>
<p>character have, perhaps, been found among the
</p>
<p>settlers of Western Virginia, and the hardy prog
</p>
<p>eny who have sprung from that generous stock.
</p>
<p>The Virginian frontiersman was, as occasion called,
</p>
<p>a farmer, a hunter, and a warrior, by turns. The
</p>
<p>well-beloved rifle was seldom out of his hand ; and
</p>
<p>he never deigned to lay aside the fringed frock,
</p>
<p>moccasons, and Indian leggins, which formed the
</p>
<p>appropriate costume of the; forest ranger. Con-
</p>
<p>cerning the business*, pleasures, and refinements
</p>
<p>of cultivated life, he knew little, and cared nothing ;
</p>
<p>and his manners were usually rough and obtrusive
</p>
<p>to the last degree. Aloof from mankind, he lived
</p>
<p>in a world of his own, which, in his view, contained
</p>
<p>all that was deserving of admiration and praise.
</p>
<p>He looked upon himself and his compeers as
</p>
<p>models of prowess and manhood, nay, of all that is
</p>
<p>elegant and polite ; and the forest gallant-regarded

<p>with peculiar complacency his own half-savage
</p>
<p>dress, his swaggering gait, and his backwoods
</p>
<p>jargon. He was wilful, headstrong, and quarrel
</p>
<p>some ; frank, straightforward, and generous ; bra^e
</p>
<p>as the bravest, and utterly intolerant of arbitrary
</p>
<p>control. His self-confidence mounted to audacity.
</p>
<p>Eminently capable of heroism, both in action and
</p>
<p>endurance, he viewed every species of effeminacy
</p>
<p>with supreme contempt ; and, accustomed as he
</p>
<p>was to entire self-reliance, the mutual dependence
</p>
<p>of conventional life excited his especial scorn.
</p>
<p>With all his ignorance, he had a mind by nature
</p>
<p>quick, vigorous, and penetrating ; and his mode of
</p>
<p>life, while it developed the daring energy of his
</p>
<p>character, wrought some of his faculties to a high
</p>
<p>degree of acuteness. Many of his traits have been
</p>
<p>reproduced in his offspring. From him have
</p>
<p>sprung those hardy men whose struggles and suf-
</p>
<p>ferings on the bloody ground of Kentucky will
</p>
<p>always form a striking page in American history ;
</p>
<p>and that band of adventurers before whose head-
</p>
<p>long charge, in the valley of Chihuahua, neither
</p>
<p>breastworks, nor batteries, nor fivefold odds could
</p>
<p>avail for a moment.
</p>
<p>At the period of Pontiac's war, the settlements
</p>
<p>of Virginia had extended as far as the Alloghanies,
</p>
<p>and several small towns had already sprung up
</p>
<p>beyond the Blue Ridge. The population of these
</p>
<p>beautiful valleys was, for the most part, thin and
</p>
<p>scattered ; and the progress of settlement had been
</p>
<p>greatly retarded by Indian hostilities, which, during

<p>the early years of the French war, had thrown

</p>
<p>these borders into total confusion. They had con-
</p>
<p>tributed, however, to enhance the martial temper
</p>
<p>of the people, and give a warlike aspect to the
</p>
<p>whole frontier. At intervals, small stockade forts,
</p>
<p>containing houses and cabins, had been erected by
</p>
<p>ihe joint labor of the inhabitants ; and hither, on
</p>
<p>occasion of alarm, the settlers of the neighborhood
</p>
<p>congregated for refuge, remaining in tolerable
</p>
<p>security till the danger was past. Many of the
</p>
<p>inhabitants were engaged for a great part of the
</p>
<p>year in hunting ; an occupation upon which they
</p>
<p>entered with the keenest relish.^ Well versed in
</p>
<p>woodcraft, unsurpassed as marksmen, and prac-
</p>
<p>tised in all the wiles of Indian war, they would
</p>
<p>have formed, under a more stringent organization,
</p>
<p>the best possible defence against a savage enemy ;
</p>
<p>but each man came and went at his own sovereign
</p>
<p>will, and discipline and obedience were repugnant
</p>
<p>to all his habits.
</p>
<p>The frontiers of Maryland and Virginia closely
</p>
<p>resembled each other ; but those of Pennsylvania
</p>
<p>had peculiarities of their own. The population
</p>
<p>of this province was of a most motley complexion,
</p>
<p>being made up of members of various nations, and
</p>
<p>1 " I have often seen them get up early in the morning at this season,
</p>
<p>lealk hastily out, and look anxiously to the woods, and snufFthe autumnal
</p>
<p>winds with the highest rapture ; then return into the house, and cast a
</p>
<p>quick and attentive look at the rifle, which was always suspended to a
</p>
<p>Joist by a couple of buck's horns, or little forks. His hunting dog, under-
</p>
<p>standing the intentions of his master, would wag his tail, and, by eveiy
</p>
<p>blandishment in his power, express his readiness to accompany him to

<p>the woods."  Doddridge, Notes on Western Va. and Pa., 124.

<p>Quakers, to whose peaceful temper the rough fron-

<p>ern parts of the province. Cumberland County j
</p>
<p>which lies west of the Susquehanna, and may be
</p>
<p>said to have formed the frontier, was then almost
</p>
<p>exclusively occupied by the Irish and their descend-
</p>
<p>ants ; who, however, were neither of the Homan
</p>
<p>faith nor of Celtic origin, being emigrants from
</p>
<p>the colony of Scotch which forms a numerous and
</p>
<p>thrifty population in the north of Ireland. In
</p>
<p>religious faith, they were stanch and zealous Pres
</p>
<p>byterians. Long residence in the province had
</p>
<p>modified their national character, and imparted
</p>
<p>many of the peculiar traits of the American back
</p>
<p>woodsman ; yet the nature of their religious tenets
</p>
<p>produced a certain rigidity of temper and demeanor,
</p>
<p>from which the Virginian was wholly free. They
</p>
<p>were, nevertheless, hot-headed and turbulent, often
</p>
<p>setting law and authority at defiance. The coun-
</p>
<p>ties east of the Susquehanna supported a mixed
</p>
<p>population, among which was conspicuous a swarm
</p>
<p>of German peasants ; who had been inundating

<p>the country for many years past, and who for the

<p>Extract from a MS. Letter, signature erased  Staunton, July 26 :

<p>" Since the reduction of the Regiment, I have lived in the country,
</p>
<p>which enables me to en form yr Ho"^' of some particulars, I think it is a
</p>
<p>duty incumbent on me to do. I can assert that in eight years' service, I
</p>
<p>never knew such a general consternation as the late irruption of Indiana
</p>
<p>has occasioned. Should they make a second attempt, I am assured the
</p>
<p>86 DESOLATION OF THE FRONTiERf^ [176a
</p>
<p>country was filled with the wildest dismay. The
</p>
<p>people of ^"irginia betook theaiselves to their
</p>
<p>torts for refuge. Those of Pennsylvania, ill sup
</p>
<p>plied with such asylums, fled by thousands, and
</p>
<p>crowded in upon the older settlements. The rang

<p>(sights of unspeakable horror; and discovered, in
</p>
<p>the depths of the forest, the half-consumed bodies
</p>
<p>of men and women, still bound fast to the trees,
</p>
<p>where they had perished in the fiery torture.^
</p>
<p>Among the numerous war-parties which were
</p>
<p>now ravaging the borders, none was more destruc-
</p>
<p>tive than a band, about sixty in number, which
</p>
<p>v.)Ountry will be laid desolate, which I attribute to the following reasons
</p>
<p>The sudden, great, and unexpected slaughter of the people ; their being
</p>
<p>destitute of ai-ras and ammunition ; the country Lieut, being at a distance
</p>
<p>and not exerting himself, his orders are neglected ; the most of the militia
</p>
<p>officers being unfit persons, or unwilling, not to say afraid to meet an
</p>
<p>Enemy ; too busy with their liarvest to run a risk in the field. The
</p>
<p>Inhabitants left without protection, without a person to stead them, have
</p>
<p>notliing to do but fly, as the Indians are saving and caressing all tlie

<p>course among the settlements about the sources of

<p>tha'. river. They passed valley after valley, some-
</p>
<p>times attacking the inhabitants by surprise, and
</p>
<p>sometimes murdering them under the mask of
</p>
<p>friendship, until they came to the little settlement
</p>
<p>of Greenbrier, where nearly a hundred of the
</p>
<p>people ^vere assembled at the fortified house of
</p>
<p>Archibald Glendenning. Seeing two or three In-
</p>
<p>dians approach, whom they recognized as former
</p>
<p>acquaintances, they suffered them to enter without
</p>
<p>distrust ; but the new-comers were soon joined by
</p>
<p>others, until the entire party were gathered in and
</p>
<p>around the buildings. Some suspicion was now
</p>
<p>awakened ; and, in order to propitiate the danger
</p>
<p>ous guests, they were presented with the carcass of
</p>
<p>an elk lately brought in by the hunters. They
</p>
<p>immediately cut it up, and began to feast upon
</p>
<p>it. The backwoodsmen, with their families, were
</p>
<p>assembled in one large room ; and finding them-
</p>
<p>selves mingled among the Indians, and embarrassed
</p>
<p>by the presence of the women and children, they
</p>
<p>remained indecisive and irresolute. Meanwhile, an
</p>
<p>old woman, who sat in a corner of the room, and who
</p>
<p>had lately received some slight accidental injury,
</p>
<p>asked one of the warriors if he could cure the
</p>
<p>wound. He replied that he thought he could, and,
</p>
<p>to make good his words, killed her with his toma-
</p>
<p>hawk. This was the signal for a scene of general
</p>
<p>butchery. A few persons made their escape ;
</p>
<p>the rest were killed or captured. Glendenning

<p>the house, but was shot dead as he leaped the
</p>
<p>fence. A negro woman gained a place of conceal
</p>
<p>ment, whither she was followed by her screaming
</p>
<p>child; and, fearing lest the cries of the boy should
</p>
<p>betray her, she turned and killed him at a blow.
</p>
<p>Among the prisoners was the wife of Glendenningj
</p>
<p>a woman of a most masculine spirit, who, far from
</p>
<p>being overpowered by what she had seen, was
</p>
<p>excited to the extremity of rage, charged her cap-
</p>
<p>tors with treachery, cowardice, and ingratitude, and
</p>
<p>assailed them with a tempest of abuse. Neither
</p>
<p>the tomahawk, which they brandished over her
</p>
<p>head, nor the scalp of her murdered husband, with
</p>
<p>which they struck her in the face, could silence
</p>
<p>the undaunted virago. When the party began
</p>
<p>their retreat, bearing with them a great quantity
</p>
<p>of plunder packed on the horses they had stolen,
</p>
<p>Glendenning's wdfe, with her infant child, was
</p>
<p>placed among a long train of captives guarded
</p>
<p>before and behind by the Indians. As they defiled
</p>
<p>along a narrow path which led through a gap in the
</p>
<p>mountains, she handed the child to the woman
</p>
<p>behind her, and, leaving it to its fate,^ slipped into
</p>
<p>the bushes and escaped. Being well acquainted
</p>
<p>with the woods, she succeeded, before nightfall, in
</p>
<p>reaching the spot where the ruins of her dwelling
</p>

</p>
<p>task was complete, and when night closed around
</p>
<p>her, the bold spirit which had hitherto borne her
</p>
<p>up suddenly gave way. The recollection of the
</p>
<p>horrors she had witnessed, the presence of the dead,
</p>
<p>the darkness, the solitude, and the gloom of the
</p>
<p>surrounding forest, wrought upon her till her
</p>
<p>terror rose to ecstasy ; and she remained until
</p>
<p>daybreak, crouched among the bushes, haunted
</p>
<p>by the threatening apparition of an armed man,
</p>
<p>who, to her heated imagination, seemed constantly
</p>
<p>approaching to murder her.^
</p>
<p>Some time after the butchery at Glendenning's
</p>
<p>house, an outrage was perpetrated, unmatched, in
</p>
<p>its fiend-like atrocity, through all the annals of the
</p>
<p>war. In a solitary place, deep within the settled
</p>
<p>limits of Pennsylvania, stood a small school-house,
</p>
<p>one of those rude structures of logs which, to this
</p>
<p>day, may be seen in some of the remote northern
</p>
<p>districts of New England. A man chancing to
</p>
<p>pass by was struck by the unwonted silence ; and,
</p>
<p>pushing open the door, he looked in. In the
</p>
<p>centre lay the master, scalped and lifeless, with a
</p>
<p>Bible clasped in his hand ; while around the room
</p>
<p>were strewn the bodies of his pupils, nine in num-
</p>
<p>ber, miserably mangled, though one of them still
</p>
<p>retained a spark of life. It was afterwards known
</p>
<p>that the deed was committed by three or four war-

<p>and the fate of one may stand for the fate of ail.

<p>Tn many a woody valley of the xilleghanies, the

<p>axe and fire-brand of the settlers had laid a wide

<p>by enclosures and cornfields ; while, farther out

<p>repent their success, lost in a trackless wilderness,
</p>
<p>and perishing miserably from hunger and expos-
</p>
<p>ure. Such attempts could seldom be made in the
</p>
<p>neighborhood of the settlements. It was onlj
</p>
<p>when the party had penetrated deep into the forest
</p>
<p>that their vigilance began to relax, and their cap-
</p>
<p>tives were bound and guarded with less rigorous
</p>
<p>severity. Then, perhaps, when encamped by the
</p>
<p>side of some mountain brook, and when the war-
</p>
<p>riors lay lost in sleep around their fire, the prisoner
</p>
<p>would cut or burn asunder the cords that bound
</p>
<p>his wrists and ankles, and glide stealthily into the
</p>
<p>woods. With noiseless celerity he pursues his
</p>
<p>flight over the fallen trunks, through the dense
</p>
<p>undergrowth, and the thousand pitfalls and imped-
</p>
<p>iments of the forest ; now striking the rough, hard
</p>
<p>trunk of a tree, now tripping among the insidious
</p>
<p>network of vines and brambles. All is darkness
</p>
<p>around him, and through the black masses of
</p>
<p>foliage above he can catch but dubious and uncer-
</p>
<p>tain glimpses of the dull sky. At length, he can
</p>
<p>hear the gurgle of a neighboring brook ; and, turn-
</p>
<p>ing towards it, he wades along its pebbly channel,
</p>
<p>fearing lest the soft mould and rotten wood of
</p>
<p>the forest might retain traces enough to direct the
</p>
<p>bloodhound instinct of his pursuers. With the
</p>
<p>dawn of the misty and cloudy morning, he is still
</p>
<p>pushing on his way, when his attention is caught
</p>
<p>by the spectral figure of an ancient birch-tree,
</p>
<p>which, with its white bark hanging about it in
</p>
<p>tatters, seems wofuUy familiar to his eye. Among

</p>
<p>recognizes the very fire from which he had fled a
</p>
<p>few hours before, and the piles of spruce boughs
</p>
<p>upon which the warriors had slept. They have
</p>
<p>gone, however, and are ranging the forest, in keen
</p>
<p>pursuit of the fugitive, who, in his blind flight
</p>
<p>amid the darkness, had circled round to the very
</p>
<p>point whence he set out ; a mistake not uncommon
</p>
<p>with careless or inexperienced travellers in the
</p>
<p>woods. Almost in despair, he leaves the ill-omened
</p>
<p>spot, and directs his course eastward with greater
</p>
<p>care ; the bark of the trees, rougher and thicker on
</p>
<p>the northern side, furnishing a precarious clew for
</p>
<p>his guidance. Around and above him nothing can
</p>
<p>be seen but the same endless monotony of brown
</p>
<p>trunks and green leaves, closing him in with an
</p>
<p>impervious screen. He reaches the foot of a moun
</p>
<p>tain, and toils upwards against the rugged declivity ;
</p>
<p>but when he stands on the summit, the view is still
</p>
<p>shut out by impenetrable thickets. High above
</p>
<p>them all shoots up the tall, gaunt stem of a blasted
</p>
<p>pine-tree ; and, in his eager longing for a view of
</p>
<p>the surrounding objects, he strains every muscle to
</p>
<p>ascend. Dark, wild, and lonely, the wilderness
</p>
<p>stretches around him, half hidden in clouds, half
</p>
<p>open to the sight, mountain and valley, crag and
</p>
<p>glistening stream ; but nowhere can he discern the
</p>
<p>trace of human hand or any hope of rest and har-
</p>
<p>borage. Before he can look for relief, league upon

<p>league must be passed, without food to sustain or

</p>
<p>storm of sleet and rain descends upon the waste.
</p>
<p>Through such scenes, and under such exposures,
</p>
<p>he presses onward, sustaining life with the aid of
</p>
<p>roots and berries or the flesh of reptiles. Perhaps,
</p>
<p>iu the last extremity, some party of Rangers find
</p>
<p>him, and bring him to a place of refuge ; perhaps,
</p>
<p>by his own efforts, he reaches some frontier post,
</p>
<p>where rough lodging and rough fare seem to him
</p>
<p>unheard-of luxury ; or perhaps, spent with fatigue
</p>
<p>and famine, he perishes in despair, a meagre ban-

<p>quet for the wolves.
</p>
<p>Within two or three wrecks after the war had
</p>
<p>broken out, the older towns and settlements of
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania were crowded w^ith refugees from the
</p>
<p>deserted frontier, reduced, in many cases, to the
</p>
<p>extremity of destitution.^ Sermons were preached
</p>
<p>in their behalf at Philadelphia ; the religious soci-
</p>
<p>eties united for their relief, and liberal contributions
</p>
<p>were added by individuals. While private aid was

<p>thus generously bestowed upon the sufferers, the

<p>government showed no such promptness in arrest-

<p>ing the public calamity. Early in July, Governor
</p>
<p>Hamilton had convoked the Assembly, and, repre-
</p>
<p>senting the distress of the borders, had urged them
</p>
<p>to take measures of defence.^ But the provincial
</p>
<p>government of Pennsylvania was more conducive
</p>
<p>to prosperity in time of peace than to efficienc} in
</p>
<p>time of war. The Quakers, who held a majority
</p>
<p>in the Assembly, were from principle and practice
</p>
<p>the reverse of warlike, and, regarding the Indians
</p>
<p>with a blind y)artiality, were reluctant to take meas-
</p>
<p>ures against them. Proud, and with some reason,
</p>
<p>of the justice and humanity which had marked
</p>
<p>their conduct towards the Indian race, they had
</p>
<p>learned to regard themselves as its advocates and
</p>
<p>patrons, and their zeal was greatly sharpened by
</p>
<p>opposition and political prejudice. They now pre-
</p>
<p>tended that the accounts from the frontier were 
</p>
<p>grossly exaggerated.; and, finding this ground X.
</p>
<p>untenable, they alleged,. with better show of reason,
</p>
<p>that the Indians were driven into hostility by the
</p>
<p>ill-treatment of the proprietaries and their parti
</p>
<p>sans. They recognized, however, the necessity of
</p>
<p>defensive measures, and accordingly passed a bill
</p>
<p>for raising and equipping a force of seven hundred
</p>
<p>men, to be composed of frontier farmers, and to be
</p>
<p>kept in pay only during the time of harvest. They
</p>
<p>were not to leave tiie settled parts of the province
</p>
<p>to engage in offensive operations of any kind, nor
</p>
<p>even to perform garrison duty ; their sole object
</p>
<p>being to enable the people to gather in their crops
</p>
<p>unmolested.

<p>This force was divided into numerous small
</p>
<p>detached parties, who were stationed here and
</p>
<p>there at farm-houses and hamlets on both sides of
</p>
<p>the Susquehanna, with orders to range the woods
</p>
<p>daily from post to post, thus forming a feeble chain
</p>
<p>of defence across the whole frontier. The two com-
</p>
<p>panies assigned to Lancaster County were placed
</p>
<p>under the command of a clergyman, John Elder,
</p>
<p>'/pastor of the Presbyterian Church of Paxton ; a

<p>i man of worth and education, and held in great

<p>respect upon the borders. He discharged his mill

<p>a cordon of troops across the front of the county,
</p>
<p>and preserving the inhabitants free from attack for
</p>
<p>a considerable time.^
</p>
<p>The feeble measures adopted by the Pennsyl-

<p>Jeffrey Amherst, and he did not hesitate to give his

<p>feelings an emphatic expression. " The conduct

<p>but the colony of Virginia, I hope, will have the
</p>
<p>honor of not only driving the enemy from its own
</p>
<p>settlements, but that of protecting those of its
</p>
<p>neighbors who have not spirit to defend them-
</p>
<p>selves."
</p>
<p>Virginia did, in truth, exhibit a vigor and activity
</p>
<p>not unworthy of praise. Unlike Pennsylvania, she
</p>
<p>had the advantage of an existing militia law ; and
</p>
<p>the House of Burgesses was neither embarrassed
</p>
<p>by scruples against the shedding of blood, nor by
</p>
<p>any peculiar tenderness towards the Indian race.
</p>
<p>The House, however, was not immediately sum-
</p>
<p>moned together ; and the governor and council,
</p>
<p>without waiting to consult the Burgesses, called
</p>
<p>out a thousand of the militia, five hundred of
</p>
<p>whom were assigned to the command of Colonel
</p>
<p>Stephen, and an equal number to that of Major
</p>
<p>Lewis. ^ The presence of these men, most of whom
</p>
<p>were woodsmen and hunters, restored order and
</p>
<p>confidence to the distracted borders ; and the inhabi
</p>
<p>tants, before pent up in their forts, or flying before
</p>
<p>the enemy, now took the field, in conjunction with
</p>
<p>the militia. Many severe actions were fought, but
</p>
<p>it, seldom happened that the Indians could stand
</p>
<p>their ground against the border riflemen. The
</p>
<p>latter were uniformly victorious until the end of
</p>
<p>the summer ; when Captains Mofl'at and Phillips,
</p>
<p>with sixty men, were lured into an ambuscade, and

</p>
<p>warriors were encamped near Jackson's Hiver
</p>
<p>preparing to attack the settlements, tliey advanced
</p>
<p>secretly to the spot, and set upon them with such
</p>
<p>fury that the whole party broke away and fled ;
</p>
<p>leaving weapons, provisions, articles of dress, and
</p>
<p>implements of magic, in the hands of the victor.?.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the frontier people of Pennsylvania,
</p>
<p>finding that they could hope for little aid from
</p>
<p>government, bestirred themselves with admirable
</p>
<p>spirit in their own defence. The march of Bou-
</p>
<p>quet, and the victory of Bushy Run, caused a
</p>
<p>temporary lull in the storm, thus enabling some of
</p>
<p>the bolder inhabitants, who had fled to Shippens-
</p>
<p>burg, Carlisle, and other places of refuge, to return
</p>
<p>to their farms, where they determined, if possible
</p>
<p>to remain. With this resolution, the people of the
</p>
<p>Great Cove, and the adjacent valleys beyond Ship-
</p>

</p>
<p>various skirmishes with the enemy, and discharged
</p>
<p>their difficult task with such success that the inhabi-
</p>
<p>tants of the neighborhood were not again driven
</p>
<p>from their homes.
</p>
<p>The attacks on the Pennsylvania frontier were
</p>
<p>known to proceed, in great measure, from several
</p>
<p>Indian villages, situated high up the west branch
</p>
<p>of the Susquehanna, and inhabited by a debauched
</p>
<p>rabble composed of various tribes, of whom the
</p>
<p>most conspicuous were Delawares. To root out
</p>
<p>this nest of banditti would be the most effectual
</p>
<p>means of protecting the settlements, and a hundred
</p>
<p>and ten men offered themselves for the enterprise.
</p>
<p>They marched about the end of August ; but on
</p>
<p>their way along the banks of the Susquehanna,
</p>
<p>they encountered fifty warriors, advancing against
</p>
<p>the borders. The Indians had the first fire, and
</p>
<p>drove in the van-guard of the white men. A hot
</p>
<p>fight ensued. The warriors fought naked, painted
</p>
<p>black from head to foot ; so that, as they leaped
</p>
<p>among the trees, they seemed to their opponents
</p>
<p>like demons of the forest. They were driven
</p>
<p>back with heavy loss ; and the volunteers returned
</p>
<p>in triumph, though Avithout accomplishing the
</p>
<p>and his adventures during several succeeding years. In the war of the
</p>
<p>Revolution, he acted the part of a zealous patriot. He lived until the yeai
</p>
<p>1812, about which time, the western Indians having broken out into hos-
</p>
<p>tility, he gave his country the benefit of his ample exx)erience, by pub-
</p>
<p>lishing a treatise on the Indian mode of warfare. In Kentucky, where h
</p>
<p>spent the latter part of his life, he was much respected, and several timet
</p>
<p>elected to the legislature. This narrative may be found in Drake's Trtigt

<p>object of the expedition ; for which, indeed, their
</p>
<p>numbers were scarcely adequate.^
</p>
<p>Within a few weeks after their return, Colonel
</p>
<p>Armstrong, a veteran partisan of the French war,
</p>
<p>raised three hundred men, the best in Cumberland
</p>
<p>County, with a view to the eiFectual destruction of
</p>
<p>the Susquehanna villages. - Leaving their rendez-
</p>
<p>vous at the crossings of the Juniata, about the first
</p>
<p>of October, they arrived on the sixth at the Great
</p>
<p>Island, high up the west branch. On or near this
</p>
<p>island were situated the principal villages of the
</p>
<p>enemy. But the Indians had vanished, abandon
</p>
<p>ing their houses, their cornfields, their stolen horses
</p>
<p>and cattle, and the accumulated spoil of the settle-
</p>
<p>ments. Leaving a detachment to burn the towns
</p>
<p>and lay waste the fields, Armstrong, with the main
</p>
<p>body of his men, followed close on the trail of the
</p>
<p>fugitives ; and, pursuing them through a rugged and
</p>
<p>difficult country, soon arrived at another village,
</p>
<p>thirty miles above the former. His scouts informed
</p>
<p>him that the place was full of Indians ; and his men,
</p>
<p>forming a circle around it, rushed in upon the cabins
</p>
<p>at a given signal. The Indians were gone, hav-
</p>
<p>ing stolen away in such haste that the hominy
</p>
<p>and bear's meit, prepared for their meal, were
</p>
<p>found smoking upon their dishes of birch-bark.
</p>
<p>Having burned the place to the ground, the
</p>
<p>party returned to the Great Island ; and, rejoining
</p>
<p>their companions, descended the Susquehanna,
</p>
<p>reaching Fort Augusta in a wretched condition,

<p>themselves.^
</p>
<p>Scarcely were they returned, when another expe-
</p>
<p>dition was set on foot, in which a portion of them
</p>
<p>were persuaded to take part. During the previous
</p>
<p>year, a body of settlers from Connecticut had pos
</p>
<p>sossed themselves of the valley of Wyoming, on
</p>
<p>the east branch of the Susquehanna, in defiance of
</p>
<p>tlie government of Pennsylvania, and to the great
</p>
<p>displeasure of the Indians. The object of the
</p>
<p>expedition was to remove these settlers, and destroy
</p>
<p>their corn and provisions, which might otherwise
</p>
<p>fall into the hands of the enemy. The party, com
</p>
<p>posed chiefly of volunteers from Lancaster County,
</p>
<p>set out from Harris's Ferry, under the command of
</p>
<p>Major Clayton, and reached Wyoming on the seven-
</p>
<p>teenth of October. They were too late. Two days
</p>
<p>before their arrival, a massacre had been perpe-
</p>
<p>trated, the fitting precursor of that subsequent
</p>
<p>scene of blood which, embalmed in the poetic
</p>
<p>romance of Campbell, has made the name of Wy-
</p>
<p>oming a household word. The settlement was a
</p>
<p>pile of ashes and cinders, and the bodies of its
</p>
<p>miserable inhabitants offered frightful proof of the
</p>
<p>cruelties inflicted upon them.^ A large war-party
</p>
<p>had fallen upon the place, killed and carried off
</p>
<p>more than twenty of the people, and driven the rest,

</p>
<p>tains. Gaining a point which commanded the
</p>
<p>whole expanse of the valley below, the fugitives
</p>
<p>looked back, and saw the smoke rolling up in
</p>
<p>volumes from their burning homes ; while the
</p>
<p>Indians could be discerned roaming about in
</p>
<p>quest of plunder, or feasting in groups upon the
</p>
<p>slaughtered cattle. One of the principal settlers, a
</p>
<p>man named Hopkins, was separated from the rest,
</p>
<p>and driven into the woods. Finding himself closely
</p>
<p>pursued, he crept into the hollow trunk of a fallen
</p>
<p>ti'ee, while the Indians passed without observing him.
</p>
<p>They soon returned to the spot, and ranged the sur-
</p>
<p>rounding woods like hounds at fault ; two of them
</p>
<p>approaching so near, that, as Hopkins declared, he
</p>
<p>could hear the bullets rattle in their pouches. The
</p>
<p>search was unavailing ; but the fugitive did not ven-
</p>
<p>ture from his place of concealment until extreme
</p>
<p>hunger forced him to return to the ruined settle-
</p>
<p>ment in search of food. The Indians had aban-
</p>
<p>doned it some time before ; and, having found means
</p>
<p>to restore his exhausted strength, he directed his
</p>
<p>course towards the settlements of the Delaware,
</p>
<p>which he reached after many days of wandering.*
</p>
<p>Having buried the dead bodies of those who had
</p>
<p>fallen in the massacre, Clayton and his party
</p>
<p>returned to the settlements. The Quakers, who
</p>
<p>seemed resolved that they would neither defend

<p>the people of the frontier nor allow them to defend

<p>themselves, vehemently inveighed against the several

<p>expeditions up the Susquehanna, and denounced
</p>
<p>them as seditious and murderous. Urged by their
</p>
<p>blind prejudice in favor of the Indians, they
</p>
<p>insisted that the bands of the Upper Susquehanna
</p>
<p>were friendly to the English ; whereas, with the sin-
</p>
<p>gle exception of a few Moravian converts near Wy-
</p>
<p>oming, who had not been molested by the whites,
</p>
<p>there could be no rational doubt that these savages
</p>
<p>nourished a rancorous and malignant hatred against
</p>
<p>the province. But the Quakers, removed by their
</p>
<p>situation from all fear of the tomahawk, securely
</p>
<p>vented their spite against the borderers, and dog-
</p>
<p>gedly closed their ears to the truth. ^ Meanwhile,
</p>
<p>the people of the frontier besieged the Assembly
</p>
<p>with petitions for relief ; but little heed was given
</p>
<p>to their complaints.
</p>
<p>Sir Jeffrey Amherst had recently resigned his
</p>
<p>office of commander-in-chief; and General Gage, a
</p>
<p>man of less efficiency than his predecessor, was
</p>
<p>appointed to succeed him. Immediately before his
</p>
<p>departure for England, Amherst had reluctantly
</p>
<p>condescended to ask the several provinces foi
</p>
<p>troops to march against the Indians early in the
</p>
<p>spring, and the first act of Gage was to confirm
</p>
<p>this requisition. New York was called upon to
</p>
<p>furnish fourteen hundred men, and New Jersey six
</p>
<p>It has already been stated that the Quakers were confined to tho I
</p>
<p>eastern parts of the province. That their security was owing to their J
</p>
<p>local situation, rather than to the kind feeling of the Indians towards I
</p>
<p>them, is sliown by the fact, that, of the very few of their number who \
</p>
<p>lived in exposed positions, several were killed. One of them in particular, )
</p>
<p>John Fincher, seeing his house about to be attacked, went out to meet '
</p>

<p>Pennsylvania had been required to furnish a

<p>the proprietors, which for years past had clogged

<p>insisted on certain pretended rights, which the

<p>bound by imperative instructions to assert tliese

<p>These events may be ascribed, in some degree^

<p>to the renewed activity of the enemy; who, during

<p>a great part of the autumn, had left the borders

<p>their attacks became more frequent ; and districts,

<p>made desolate. Again the valleys were illumined

</p>
<p>while the fires behind them shed a ruddy glow

<p>the forest, stripped naked, and frozen to marble

<p>THE INDIANS RAISE THE SIEGE OF DETROIT.
</p>
<p>I RETURN to the long-forgotten garrison of Detroit,
</p>
<p>which was left still beleaguered by an increasing
</p>
<p>multitude of savages, and disheartened by the de-
</p>
<p>feat of Captain DalzelFs detachment. The schoon-
</p>
<p>er, so boldly defended by her crew against a force
</p>
<p>of more than twenty times their number, brought
</p>
<p>to the fort a much-needed supply of provisions.
</p>
<p>It was not, however, adequate to the wants of the
</p>
<p>garrison ; and the whole were put upon the shortest
</p>
<p>possible allowance.
</p>
<p>It was now the end of September. The Indians,
</p>
<p>with unexampled pertinacity, had pressed the siege
</p>
<p>since the beginning of May ; but at length their
</p>
<p>constancy began to fail. The tidings had reached

<p>them that Major Wilkins, with a strong force, was

<p>on his way to Detroit. They feared the consequen-

<p>ces of an attack, especially as their ammunition was

<p>almost exhausted ; and, by this time, most of them

<p>were inclined to sue for peace, as the easiest mode

<p>of gaining safety for themselves, and at the same

<p>time lulling the English into security.* Thej

</p>
<p>Accordingly, on the twelfth of October, Wapo-
</p>
<p>comoguth, great chief of the Mississaugas, a branch
</p>
<p>of the Ojibwas, living within the present limits of
</p>
<p>Upper Canada, came to the fort with a pipe of
</p>
<p>peace. He began his speech to Major Gladwyn,
</p>
<p>with the glaring falsehood that he and his people
</p>
<p>had always been friends of the English. They
</p>
<p>were now, he added, anxious to conclude a formal
</p>
<p>treaty of lasting peace and amity. He next de--
</p>
<p>clared that he had been sent as deputy by the
</p>
<p>Pottawattamies, Ojibwas, and Wyandots, who had
</p>
<p>instructed him to say that they sincerely repented
</p>
<p>of their bad conduct, asked forgiveness, and
</p>
<p>humbly beg2:ed for peace. Gladwyn perfectly
</p>
<p>understood the hollowness of these professions, but
</p>
<p>the circumstances in which he was placed made it
</p>
<p>expedient to listen to their overtures. His garrison
</p>
<p>was threatened with famine, and it was impossible
</p>
<p>to procure provisions while completely surrounded
</p>
<p>by hostile Indians. He therefore replied, that,
</p>
<p>though he was not empowered to grant peace, he
</p>
<p>would still consent to a truce. The Mississauga
</p>
<p>deputy left the fort with this reply, and Gladwyn
</p>
<p>immediately took advantage of this lull in the
</p>
<p>Btorm to collect provisions among the Canadians ;
</p>
<p>an attempt in which he succeeded so well that the

<p>108 THE SIEGE OF DETROIT RAISED. 1 1763, Oct
</p>
<p>The Ottawas alone, animated by Pontiac, had re-
</p>
<p>fused to ask for peace, and still persisted in a course
</p>
<p>of petty hostilities. They fii'ed at intervals on the
</p>
<p>English foraging parties, until, on the thh'ty-first
</p>
<p>of October, an unexpected blow was given to the
</p>
<p>hopes of their great chief. French messengers
</p>
<p>came to Detroit with a letter from M. Neyon, com
</p>
<p>niandant of Fort Chartres, the principal post in
</p>
<p>the Illinois country. This letter was one of those
</p>
<p>which, on demand of General Amherst, Neyon,
</p>
<p>with a very bad grace, had sent to the different
</p>
<p>Indian tribes. It assured Pontiac that he could
</p>
<p>expect no assistance from the French ; that they
</p>
<p>and the English were now at peace, and regarded
</p>
<p>each other as brothers ; and that the Indians had
</p>
<p>better abandon hostilities which could lead to no
</p>
<p>good result.^ The emotions of Pontiac at receiving
</p>
<p>this message may be conceived. His long-cherished
</p>
<p>hopes of assistance from the French were swept
</p>
<p>away at once, and he saw himself and his people
</p>
<p>thrown back upon their own slender resources.
</p>
<p>His cause was lost. At least, there was no present
</p>
<p>hope for him but in dissimulation. True to his
</p>
<p>Indian nature, he would put on a mask of peace,
</p>
<p>and bide his time. On the day after the arrival
</p>
<p>of the message from Neyon, Gladwyn wrote as
</p>
<p>follows to Amherst : " This moment I received a
</p>
<p>message from Pondiac, telling me that he should

<p>Having soothed the English commander with
</p>
<p>these hollow overtures, Pontiac withdrew with
</p>
<p>some of his chiefs to the Maumee, to stir up the
</p>
<p>Indians in that quarter, and renew the war in
</p>
<p>the spring.
</p>
<p>About the middle of November, not many days
</p>
<p>after Pontiac's departure, two friendly Wyandot
</p>
<p>Indians from the ancient settlement at Lorette, near
</p>
<p>Quebec, crossed the river, and asked admittance
</p>
<p>into the fort. One of them then unslung his pow-
</p>
<p>der-horn, and, taking out a false bottom, disclosed
</p>
<p>a closely folded letter, which he gave to Major
</p>
<p>Gladwyn. The letter was from Major Wilkins,
</p>
<p>1 The following is Pontiac's message to Gladwyn, written for him by
</p>
<p>a Canadian : " Mon Fr^re,  La Parole que mon Pere m'a envoyee, pour
</p>
<p>faire la paix, je I'ai acceptde, tous nos jeunes gens ont enterre leurs Casse-
</p>

</p>
<p>comme moi, tu me feras reponse. Je te souhaite le bonjour.
</p>
<p>(Signe) "PoNDiAC.
</p>
<p>Gladwyn's answer is also in French. He says that he will commu-
</p>
<p>nicate the message to the General ; and doubts not that if he, Pontiac, ia
</p>
<p>true to his words, all will be well.
</p>
<p>The following is from the letter in which Gladwyn announces th
</p>
<p>overtures of peace to Amherst (Detroit, Nov. 1): "Yesterday M. De-
</p>

<p>ment under his command had been overtaken by
</p>
<p>a storm, that many of the boats had been wrecked,
</p>
<p>that seventy men had perished, that all the stores
</p>
<p>and ammunition had been destroyed, and the
</p>
<p>detachment forced to return to Niagara. This
</p>
<p>intelUgence had an effect upon the garrison which
</p>
<p>rendered the prospect of the cold and cheerless
</p>
<p>winter yet more dreary and forlorn.
</p>
<p>The summer had long since drawn to a close,
</p>
<p>and the verdant landscape around Detroit had
</p>
<p>undergone an ominous transformation. Touched
</p>
<p>by the first October frosts, the forest glowed like a
</p>
<p>bed of tulips ; and, all along the river bank, thu
</p>
<p>painted foliage, brightened by the autumnal sun,
</p>
<p>reflected its mingled colors upon the dark water
</p>
<p>below. The western wind was fraught with life
</p>
<p>and exhilaration ; and in the clear, sharp air, the
</p>
<p>form of the fish-hawk, sailing over the distant
</p>
<p>headland, seemed almost within range of the
</p>
<p>sportsman's gun.
</p>
<p>A week or two elapsed, and then succeeded that
</p>
<p>gentler season which bears among us the name of
</p>
<p>the Indian summer ; when a light haze rests upon
</p>
<p>the morning landscape, and the many-colored woods
</p>
<p>seem wrapped in the thin drapery of a veil ; when
</p>
<p>the air is mild and calm as that of early June, and
</p>
<p>at evening the sun goes down amid a warm, volup-
</p>
<p>tuous beauty, that may well outrival the softest
</p>
<p>tints of Italy. But through all the still and breath-

</p>
<p>that the last melancholy change is at hand. And,
</p>
<p>in truth, on the morrow the sky is overspread with
</p>
<p>cold and stormy clouds ; and a raw, piercing wind
</p>
<p>blows angrily from the north-east. The shivering
</p>
<p>sentinel quickens his step along the rampart, and
</p>
<p>the half-naked Indian folds his tattered blanket
</p>
<p>close around him. The shrivelled leaves are blown
</p>
<p>from the trees, and soon the gusts are whistling and
</p>
<p>howling amid gray, naked twigs and mossy branches.
</p>
<p>Here and there, indeed, the beech tree, as the wind
</p>
<p>sweeps among its rigid boughs, shakes its pale
</p>
<p>assemblage of crisp and rustling leaves. The pines
</p>
<p>and firs, with their rough tops of dark evergreen,
</p>
<p>bend and moan in the wind ; and the crow caws
</p>
<p>sullenly, as, struggling against the gusts, he flaps
</p>
<p>his black wings above the denuded woods.
</p>
<p>The vicinity of Detroit was now almost aban-
</p>
<p>doned by its besiegers, who had scattered among
</p>
<p>the forests to seek sustenance through the winter
</p>
<p>for themselves and their families. Unlike the
</p>
<p>buffalo-hunting tribes of the western plains, they
</p>
<p>could not at this season remain together in large
</p>
<p>bodies. The comparative scarcity of game forced
</p>
<p>them to separate into small bands, or even into
</p>
<p>single families. Some steered their canoes far
</p>
<p>northward, across Lake Huron ; while others turned
</p>
<p>westward, and struck into the great wilderness cf
</p>
<p>Michigan. Wandering among forests, bleak, cheer
</p>

</p>
<p>backs of the squaws, were their only shelter
</p>
<p>Encamped at intervals by the margin of some
</p>
<p>frozen lake, surrounded by all that is most stern
</p>
<p>and dreary in the aspects of nature, they were sub-
</p>
<p>jected to every hardship, and endured all with
</p>
<p>stubborn stoicism. Sometimes, during the frosty
</p>
<p>night, they were gathered in groups about the
</p>
<p>flickering lodge-fire, listening to traditions of theii
</p>
<p>forefathers, and wild tales of magic and incanta-
</p>
<p>tion. Perhaps, before the season was past, some
</p>
<p>bloody feud broke out among them ; perhaps they
</p>
<p>were assailed by their ancient enemies the Dahco-
</p>
<p>tah ; or perhaps some sinister omen or evil dream
</p>
<p>spread more terror through the camp than the
</p>
<p>presence of an actual danger would have awakened.
</p>
<p>With the return of spring, the scattered parties
</p>
<p>once more united, and moved towards Detroit, to
</p>
<p>indulge their unforgotten hatred against the Eng-
</p>
<p>lish.
</p>
<p>Detroit had been the central point of the Indian
</p>
<p>operations ; its capture had been their favorite pro-
</p>
<p>ject; around it they had concentrated their greatest
</p>
<p>force, and the failure of the attempt proved disas-
</p>
<p>trous to their cause. Upon the Six Nations, more
</p>
<p>especially, it produced a marked effect. The
</p>
<p>friendly tribes of this confederacy were confii'med
</p>
<p>in their friendship, while the hostile Senecas began
</p>
<p>to lose heart. Availing himself of this state of
</p>
<p>things, Sir William Johnson, about the middle

<p>of the winter, persuaded a number of Six Nation

<p>offering rewards of fifty dollars for the heads of the
</p>
<p>two principal Delaware chiefs.^ Two hundred of
</p>
<p>them, accompanied by a few provincials, left the
</p>
<p>Oneida country during the month of February, and
</p>
<p>directed their course southward. They had been
</p>
<p>out but a few days, when they found an encamp-
</p>
<p>ment of forty Delawares, commanded by a formid
</p>
<p>able chief, known as Captain Bull, who, with his
</p>
<p>warriors, was on his way to attack the settlements.
</p>
<p>They surrounded the camp undiscovered, during
</p>
<p>the night, and at dawn of day raised the war-whoop
</p>
<p>and rushed in. The astonished Delawares had no
</p>
<p>time to snatch their arms. They were all made

</p>
<p>to New York, where they were conducted, under

<p>a strong guard, to the common jail ; the mob

<p>reverses would have done, if encountered at the
</p>
<p>hands of the English alone. ^
</p>
<p>The calamities which overwhelmed the borders
</p>
<p>of the middle provinces were not unfelt at the
</p>
<p>south. It was happy for the people of the Caro-
</p>
<p>linas that the Cherokees, who had broken out
</p>
<p>against them three years before, had at that time
</p>
<p>received a chastisement which they could never
</p>
<p>forget, and from which they had not yet begun to
</p>
<p>recover. They were thus compelled to remain
</p>
<p>comparatively quiet ; while the ancient feud be-
</p>
<p>tween them and the northern tribes would, under
</p>
<p>any circumstances, have prevented their uniting
</p>
<p>with the latter. The contagion of the war reached
</p>
<p>them, however, and they perpetrated numerous
</p>
<p>murders ; while the neighboring nation of the
</p>
<p>Creeks rose in open hostility, and committed
</p>
<p>formidable ravages. Towards the north, the In-
</p>
<p>dian tribes were compelled, by their position, to
</p>
<p>remain tranquil, yet they showed many signs of
</p>
<p>uneasiness ; and those of ]N^ova Scotia caused great
</p>
<p>alarm, by mustering in large bodies in the neigh-
</p>
<p>borhood of Halifax. The excitement among them
</p>
<p>was temporary, and they dispersed without attempt-

<p>ing mischief.

<p>an equal number of families driven from their

<p>trained under all the influences of the warlike
</p>
<p>frontier. They fiercely .complained that they were
</p>
<p>interposed as a barrier between the rest of the
</p>
<p>province and a ferocious enemy ; and that they were
</p>
<p>sacrificed to the safety of men who looked with
</p>
<p>indifi"erence on their miseries, and lost no oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity to extenuate and smooth away the crueltiea
</p>
<p>of their destroyers.^ They declared that the
</p>
<p>Quakers would go farther to befriend a murder-
</p>
<p>ing Delaware than to succor a fellow-countryman ;
</p>
<p>that they loved red blood better than white, and a
</p>
<p>pagan better than a Presbyterian. The Pennsyl
</p>
<p>vania borderers were, as we have seen, chiefly
</p>
<p>the descendants of Presbyterian emigrants from the
</p>
<p>north of Ireland. They had inherited some por-
</p>
<p>tion of their forefathers' sectarian zeal, which,
</p>
<p>while it did nothing to soften the barbarity of their
</p>
<p>manners, served to inflame their animosity against
</p>
<p>the Quakers, and added bitterness to their just
</p>
<p>complaints. It supplied, moreover, a convenient
</p>
<p>sanction for the indulgence of their hatred and
</p>
<p>vengeance ; for, in the general turmoil of their pas-
</p>
<p>sions, fanaticism too was awakened, and they inter
</p>
<p>preted the command that Joshua should destroy

<p>exterminate the Indians.
</p>
<p>The prevaiUng excitement was not confined to
</p>
<p>the vulgar. Even the clergy and the chief magis-
</p>
<p>ti'ates shared it ; and while they lamented the excess
</p>
<p>of the popular resentment, they maintained that
</p>
<p>the general complaints were founded in justice.
</p>
<p>Viewing all the circumstances, it is not greatly to
</p>
<p>be wondered at that some of the more violent class
</p>
<p>were inflamed to the commission of atrocities which
</p>
<p>bear no very favorable comparison with those of
</p>
<p>the Indians themselves.
</p>
<p>It is not easy for those living in the tranquillity
</p>
<p>of polished life fully to conceive the depth and
</p>
<p>force of that unquenchable, indiscriminate hate,
</p>
<p>which Indian outrages can awaken in those who
</p>
<p>have suffered them. The chronicles of the Amer-
</p>
<p>ican borders are filled with the deeds of men, who,
</p>
<p>having lost all by the merciless tomahawk, have
</p>
<p>lived for vengeance alone ; and such men will never
</p>
<p>cease to exist so long as a hostile tribe remains
</p>
<p>within striking distance of an American settlement^
</p>
<p>Never was this hatred more deep or more general
</p>
<p>than on the Pennsylvania frontier at this period ;
</p>
<p>and never, perhaps, did so many collateral causes
</p>
<p>unite to inflame it to madness. It was not long

<p>in finding a vent.

<p>118 THE PAXTON MEN. [176 A
</p>
<p>from the town of Lancaster, was a spot known as
</p>
<p>the Manor of Conestoga ; where a small band of
</p>
<p>Indians, speaking the Iroquois tongue, had been
</p>
<p>sealed since the first settlement of the province.
</p>
<p>William Penn had visited and made a treaty with
</p>
<p>them, which had been confirmed by several suc-
</p>
<p>ceeding governors, so that the band had always
</p>
<p>remained on terms of friendship with the English.
</p>
<p>Yet, like other Indian communities in the neighbor-
</p>
<p>hood of the whites, they had dwindled in numbers
</p>
<p>and prosperity, until they were reduced to twenty
</p>
<p>persons ; who inhabited a cluster of squalid cabins^
</p>
<p>and lived by beggary and the sale of brooms,
</p>
<p>baskets, and wooden ladles, made by the women.
</p>
<p>The men spent a small part of their time in hunt-
</p>
<p>ing, and lounged away the rest in idleness. In
</p>
<p>the immediate neighborhood, they were commonly
</p>
<p>regarded as harmless vagabonds ; but elsewhere a
</p>
<p>more unfavorable opinion was entertained, and they
</p>
<p>were looked upon as secretly abetting the enemy,
</p>
<p>acting as spies, giving shelter to scalping-parties,
</p>
<p>and even aiding them in their depredations. That
</p>
<p>these suspicions were not wholly unfounded is
</p>
<p>shown by a conclusive mass of evidence, though it
</p>
<p>is probable that the treachery was confiried to one
</p>
<p>or two individuals.^ The exasperated frontiersmen
</p>
<p>were not in a mood to discriminate, and the inno-
</p>
<p>cent were destined to share the fate of the guilty.*

<p>is extremely probable, as sliown by Mr. Shea, that they were the rem

<p>Iroquois, but were deadly enemies of the Iroquois proper, or Five Nations,

</p>
<p>enhanced by the sense of their ow^n more recent
</p>
<p>sufferings. Mention has before been made of John
</p>
<p>Elder, the Presbyterian minister of this place ; a
</p>
<p>man whose worth, good sense, and superior educa
</p>
<p>tion gave him the character of counsellor and
</p>
<p>director throughout the neighborhood, and caused
</p>
<p>him to be known and esteemed even in Philadel-
</p>
<p>phia. His position was a peculiar one. From the
</p>
<p>rough pulpit of his little church, he had often
</p>
<p>preached to an assembly of armed men, while
</p>
<p>scouts and sentinels were stationed without, to give
</p>
<p>warning of the enemy's approach.^ The men of
</p>
<p>Paxton, under the auspices of their pastor, formed
</p>
<p>themselves into a body of rangers, who became
</p>
<p>noted for their zeal and efficiency in defending the
</p>
<p>borders. One of their principal leaders was Mat-

</p>
<p>including the preacher, had a rifle at his side ; upon which the enemy
</p>
<p>withdrew, and satisfied themselves with burning a few houses in the
</p>
<p>neighborhood. The papers of Mr. Elder were submitted to the writer'

<p>larity among his associates, and was not without
</p>
<p>pretensions to education ; while he shared a full
</p>
<p>proportion of the general hatred against Indians,
</p>
<p>and suspicion against the band of Conestoga.
</p>
<p>Towards the middle of December, a scout came
</p>
<p>to the house of Smith, and reported that an In
</p>
<p>dian, known to have committed depredations in
</p>
<p>the neighborhood, had been traced to Conestoga.
</p>
<p>Smith's resolution was taken at once. He called
</p>
<p>five of his companions ; and, having armed and
</p>
<p>mounted, they set out for the Indian settlement.
</p>
<p>They reached it early in the night ; and Smith,
</p>
<p>leaving his horse in charge of the others, crawled
</p>
<p>forward, rifle in hand, to reconnoitre ; when he saw,
</p>
<p>or fancied he saw, a number of armed warriors in
</p>
<p>the cabins. Upon this discovery he withdrew,
</p>
<p>and rejoined his associates. Believing themselves
</p>
<p>too weak for an attack, the party returned to Pax-
</p>
<p>ton. Their blood was up, and they determined to
</p>
<p>extirpate the Conestogas. Messengers went abroad
</p>
<p>trough the neighborhood ; and, on the following
</p>
<p>day, about fifty armed and mounted men, chiefly
</p>
<p>from the towns of Paxton and Donegal, assembled
</p>
<p>at the place agreed upon. Led by Matthew Smith,
</p>
<p>they took the road to Conestoga, where they ar-
</p>
<p>iiv(^d a little before daybreak, on the morning of
</p>
<p>the fourteenth. As they drew near, they discerned
</p>
<p>the light of a fire in one of the cabins, gleaming
</p>
<p>across the snow. Leaving their horses in the for-
</p>
<p>est, they separated into small parties, and advanced
</p>
<p>on several sides at once. Though they moved with

<p>voices caught the ear of an Indian ; and they saw
</p>
<p>him issue from one of the cabins, and walk for
</p>
<p>ward in the direction of the noise. He came so
</p>
<p>near that one of the men fancied that he recognized
</p>
<p>iiim. " He is the one that killed my mother," he
</p>
<p>exclaimed with an oath ; and, firing his rifle,
</p>
<p>brought the Indian down. With a general shout
</p>
<p>the furious ruffians burst into the cabins, and shot,
</p>
<p>stabbed, and hacked to death all whom they found
</p>
<p>there.. It happened that only six Indians were in
</p>
<p>the place ; the rest, in accordance with their vagrant
</p>
<p>habits, being scattered about the neighborhood.
</p>
<p>Thus baulked of their complete vengeance, the
</p>
<p>murderers seized upon what little booty they could
</p>
<p>find, set the cabins on fire, and departed at dawn
</p>
<p>of day.^
</p>
<p>The morning was cold and murky. Snow was
</p>
<p>falling, and already lay deep upon the ground ;
</p>
<p>and, as they urged their horses through the drifts,
</p>
<p>they were met by one Thomas Wright, who, struck
</p>
<p>by tlieir appearance, stopped to converse with them.
</p>
<p>They freely told him what they had done ; and, on

<p>for whose information it had been written. The account is partially con
</p>
<p>firmed by incidental allusions, in a letter written by another of the Faxton
</p>
<p>men, and also published by Mr. Conyngham. This gentleman employed
</p>
<p>himself with most unwearied diligence in collecting a voluminous mass of

<p>Scripture did not command that the heathen should
</p>
<p>be destroyed.
</p>
<p>They soon after separated, dispersing among the
</p>
<p>farm-houses, to procure food for themselves and
</p>
<p>their horses. Several rode to the house of llobeit
</p>
<p>Barber, a prominent settler in the neighborhood ;
</p>
<p>who, seeing the strangers stam])ing their feet and
</p>
<p>shaking the snow from their blanket coats, invited
</p>
<p>them to enter, and offered them refreshment. Hav-
</p>
<p>ing remained for a short time seated before his
</p>
<p>fire, they remounted and rode off through the snow-
</p>
<p>storm. A boy of the family, who had gone to
</p>
<p>look at the horses of the visitors, came in and
</p>
<p>declared that he had seen a tomahawk, covered
</p>
<p>with blood, hanging from each man's saddle ; and
</p>
<p>that a small gun, belonging to one of the Indian
</p>
<p>children, had been leaning against the fence. ^
</p>
<p>Barber at once guessed the truth, and, with several
</p>
<p>of his neighbors, proceeded to the Indian settle-
</p>
<p>ment, where they found the solid log cabins still
</p>
<p>on fire. They buried the remains of the victims,
</p>
<p>which Barber compared in appearance to half-
</p>
<p>burnt logs. While they were thus engaged, the
</p>
<p>sheriff of Lancaster, with a party of men, arrived
</p>
<p>on the spot ; and the first care of the officer was to
</p>
<p>send through the neighborhood to collect the In-
</p>
<p>dians, fourteen in number, who had escaped the

<p>massacre. This was soon accomplished. The un

<p>lives, and earnestly begged protection. They were
</p>
<p>conducted to Lancaster, where, amid great excite
</p>
<p>ment, they were lodged in the county jail, a strong
</p>
<p>stone building, which it was thought would afford
</p>
<p>the surest refuge.
</p>
<p>An express was despatched to Philadelphia with
</p>
<p>news of the massacre ; on hearing which, the gov-
</p>
<p>ernor issued a proclamation denouncing the act.
</p>
<p>and offering a reward for the discovery of the
</p>
<p>perpetrators. Undaunted by this measure, and en-
</p>
<p>raged that any of their victims should have escaped,
</p>
<p>the Paxton men determined to continue the work
</p>
<p>they had begun. In this resolution they were con-
</p>
<p>firmed by the prevailing impression, that an Indian
</p>
<p>known to have murdered the relatives of one of
</p>
<p>their number was among those who had received
</p>
<p>the protection of the magistrates at Lancaster.
</p>
<p>They sent forward a spy to gain intelligence, and,
</p>
<p>on his return, once more met at their rendezvous.
</p>
<p>On this occasion, their nominal leader was Lazarus
</p>
<p>Stewart, who was esteemed upon the borders as a
</p>
<p>brave and active young man ; and who, there is
</p>
<p>strong reason to believe, entertained no worse
</p>
<p>design than that of seizing the obnoxious Indian,
</p>
<p>carrying him to Carlisle, and there putting him to
</p>
<p>death, in case he should be identified as the mux
</p>
<p>derer.^ Most of his followers, however, hardened
</p>
<p>amidst war and bloodshed, were bent on indiscrim-
</p>
<p>inate slaughter ; a purpose which they concealed
</p>
<p>from their more moderate associates.

<p>party, about fifty in number, left Paxton on their
</p>
<p>desperate errand. Elder had used all his influence
</p>
<p>to divert them from their design ; and now, seeing
</p>
<p>them depart, he mounted his horse, overtook them,
</p>
<p>and addressed them with the most earnest remon
</p>
<p>strance. Finding his words unheeded, he drew up
</p>
<p>his horse across the narrow road in front, and
</p>
<p>charged them, on his authority as their pastor, to
</p>
<p>return. Upon this, Matthew Smith rode forward,
</p>
<p>and, pointing his rifle at the breast of Elder's horse,
</p>
<p>threatened to fire unless he drew him aside, and
</p>
<p>gave room to pass. The clergyman was forced to
</p>
<p>comply, and the party proceeded.^
</p>
<p>At about three o'clock in the afternoon, the riot-
</p>
<p>ers, armed with rifle, knife, and tomahawk, rode at
</p>
<p>a gallop into Lancaster ; turned their horses into
</p>
<p>the yard of the public house, ran to the jail, burst
</p>
<p>open the door, and rushed tumultuously in. The
</p>
<p>fourteen Indians were in a small yard adjacent to
</p>
<p>the building, surrounded by high stone walls.
</p>
<p>Hearing the shouts of the mob, and startled by the
</p>
<p>apparition of armed men in the doorway, two or
</p>
<p>three of them snatched up billets of wood in self
</p>
<p>defence. Whatever may have been the purpose
</p>
<p>of the Paxton men, this show of resistance ban-
</p>
<p>ished every thought of forbearance ; and the
</p>
<p>foremost, rushing forward, fired their rifles among
</p>
<p>the crowd of Indians. In a moment more, the
</p>
<p>yard was filled with ruflians, shouting, cursing,
</p>
<p>and firing upon the cowering wretches ; holding

<p>the muzzles of their pieces, in some instances, so
</p>
<p>near their victims' heads that the brains were scat-
</p>
<p>tered by the explosion. The work was soon
</p>
<p>finished. The bodies of men, women, and chil-
</p>
<p>dren, mangled with outrageous brutality, lay scat-
</p>
<p>tered about the yard ; and the murderers were

<p>gone.^

<p>When the first alarm was given, the magistrate?
</p>
<p>were in the church, attending the Christmas ser

<p>vice, which had been postponed on the twenty-

<p>fifth. The door was fiung open, and the voice of a
</p>
<p>man half breathless was heard in broken exclama-
</p>
<p>tions, "Murder  the jail  the Paxton Boys 
</p>
<p>the Indians."

<p>scene of riot; but, before he could reach it, all

<p>Soon after the massacre, Franklin published an account of it at Phila-

<p>delphia, which, being intended to strengthen the hands of government by
</p>
<p>exciting a popular sentiment against the rioters, is more rhetorical than
</p>
<p>accurate. The following is Ms account of the consummation of t' a

<p>" When the poor wretches saw they had no protection nigh, nor
</p>
<p>could possibly escape, they divided into their little families, the children
</p>
<p>slinging to the parents ; they fell on their knees, protested their inno-
</p>
<p>3ence, declared their love to the English, and that, in their whole lives,
</p>
<p>they had never done them injury ; and in this posture they all received
</p>
<p>the hatchet!"
</p>
<p>This is a pure embellishment of the fancy. The only persons pres-
</p>
<p>ent were the jailer and the rioters themselves, who unite in testifying

<p>that the Indians died with the stoicism which their race usually ex-

<p>was finished, and the murderers were galloping in
</p>
<p>a body from the town.^ The sherifi' and the

</p>
<p>abetting them, as their enemies affirm, but, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to then' own statement, vainly risking their
</p>
<p>lives to restore order.^ A company of Highland
</p>
<p>soldiers, on their way from Fort Pitt to Philadel-
</p>
<p>phia, were encamped near the town. Their com-
</p>
<p>mander, Captain E-obertson, afterwards declared
</p>
<p>that he put himself in the way of the magistrates,
</p>
<p>expecting that they would call upon him to aid the
</p>

</p>
<p>the inhabitants testify, that, when they urged him
</p>
<p>to interfere, he replied with an oath that his men
</p>
<p>had suffered enough from Indians already, and
</p>
<p>should not stir hand or foot to save them. Be this

<p>as it may, it seems certain that neither soldiers nor

<p>magistrates, with their best exertions, could have
</p>
<p>availed to prevent the massacre ; for so well was
</p>
<p>the plan concerted, that, within ten or twelve
</p>
<p>minutes after the alarm, the Indians were dead,
</p>
<p>and the murderers mounted to depart.
</p>
<p>The people crowded into the jail-yard to gaze
</p>
<p>upon the miserable spectacle ; and. when their
</p>
<p>curiosity was sated, the bodies were gathered
</p>
<p>together, and buried not far from the town, where
</p>
<p>they reposed three quarters of a century ; until, at
</p>
<p>length, the bones were disinterred in preparing the
</p>
<p>foundation for a railroad.
</p>
<p>The tidings of this massacre threw the country
</p>
<p>into a ferment. Various opinions were expressed ;
</p>
<p>but, in the border counties, even the most sober
</p>
<p>and moderate regarded it, not as a wilful and delib-
</p>
<p>erate crime, but as the mistaken act of rash men,
</p>
<p>fevered to desperation by wrongs and sufferings.^
</p>
<p>When the news reached Philadelphia, a clamor-
</p>
<p>ous outcry rose from the Quakers, who could find no

<p>md his friends talk of leaving  if they do, the province veill lose some

<p>words to express their horror and detesta^^ion. They
</p>
<p>assailed not the rioters only, but the whole Pres-
</p>
<p>byterian sect, with a tempest of abuse, not the less
</p>
<p>virulent for being vented in the name of philan-
</p>
<p>thropy and religion. The governor again issued
</p>
<p>a proclamation, offering rewards for the detection
</p>
<p>and arrest of the murderers; but the latter, far
</p>
<p>from shrinking into concealment, proclaimed their
</p>
<p>deed in the face of day, boasted the achievement,
</p>
<p>and defended it by reason and Scripture. So great
</p>
<p>was the excitement in the frontier counties, and so
</p>
<p>deep the synlpathy with the rioters, that to arrest
</p>
<p>them would have required the employment of a
</p>
<p>strong military force, an experiment far too danger-
</p>
<p>ous to be tried. Nothing of the kind was attempted
</p>
<p>until nearly eight years afterwards, when Lazarus
</p>
<p>Stewart was apprehended on the charge of mur-
</p>
<p>dering the Indians of Conestoga. Learning that
</p>
<p>his trial was to take place, not in the county where
</p>
<p>the act was committed, but in Philadelphia, and
</p>
<p>thence judging that his condemnation was certain,
</p>
<p>he broke jail and escaped. Having written a dec-
</p>
<p>laration to justify his conduct, he called his old
</p>
<p>associates around him, set the provincial gov-
</p>
<p>ernment of Pennsylvania at defiance, and withdrew
</p>
<p>to Wyoming with his band. Here he joined the
</p>
<p>settlers recently arrived from Connecticut, and
</p>
<p>thenceforth played a conspicuous part in the
</p>
<p>eventful history of that remarkable spot.^

<p>1768 1 THE MORAVIAN CONVERTS. 129
</p>
<p>After the massacre at Conestoga, the excitement
</p>
<p>in the frontier counties, far from subsiding, in-
</p>
<p>creased in violence daily; and various circumstances
</p>
<p>conspired to inflame it. The principal of these
</p>
<p>was the course pursued by the provincial govern-
</p>
<p>ment towards the Christian Indians attached to the
</p>
<p>Moravian missions. Many years had elapsed since
</p>
<p>the Moravians began the task of converting the
</p>
<p>Indians of Pennsylvania, and their steadfast energy
</p>
<p>and regulated zeal had been crowned with sue
</p>
<p>cess. Several thriving settlements of their con-
</p>
<p>verts had sprung up in the valley of the Lehigh,
</p>
<p>when the opening of the French war, in 1755,
</p>
<p>involved them in unlooked-for calamities. These
</p>
<p>unhappy neutrals, between the French and Indians
</p>
<p>on the one side, and the English on the other,
</p>
<p>excited the enmity of both ; and while from the
</p>
<p>west they were threatened by the hatchets of their
</p>
<p>own countrymen, they were menaced on the east
</p>
<p>by the no less formidable vengeance of the white
</p>
<p>settlers, who, in their distress and terror, never
</p>
<p>doubted that the Moravian converts were in league
</p>
<p>with the enemy. The popular rage against them
</p>
<p>at length grew so furious, that their destruction
</p>
<p>was resolved upon. The settlers assembled and
</p>
<p>advanced against the Moravian community of
</p>
<p>Gnadenhutten ; but the French and Indians gained
</p>
<p>for vengeance. As a Ranger, I sought the post of danger, and now you
</p>
<p>ask my life. Let me be tried where prejudice has not prejudged my case.
</p>
<p>Let my brave Rangers, who have stemmed the blast nobly, and never
</p>
<p>flinched ; lot them have an equitable trial ; they were my friends in tlie
</p>
<p>hour of danger  to desert them now were cowaidice ! What remains it
</p>
<p>U> leave our cause with our God, and our guns."

<p><the first blow, and, descending upon the doomed
</p>
<p>settlement, utterly destroyed it. This disaster,
</p>
<p>deplorable as it was in itself, proved the safety of
</p>
<p>the other Moravian settlements, by making it fully
</p>
<p>apparent that their inhabitants were not in league
</p>
<p>with the enemy. They were suffered to remain
</p>
<p>unmolested for several years ; but with the mur-
</p>
<p>ders that ushered in Pontiac's war, in 1763, the
</p>
<p>former suspicion revived, and the expediency of
</p>
<p>destroying the Moravian Indians was openly
</p>
<p>debated. Towards the end of the summer, sev-
</p>
<p>eral outrages were committed upon the settlers in
</p>
<p>the neighborhood, and the Moravian Indians were
</p>
<p>loudly accused of taking part in them. These
</p>
<p>charges were never fully confuted ; and, taking
</p>
<p>into view the harsh treatment which the converts
</p>
<p>had always experienced from the whites, it is
</p>
<p>highly probable that some of them were disposed
</p>
<p>to sympathize with their heathen countrymen,
</p>
<p>who are known to have courted their alliance.
</p>
<p>The Moravians had, however, excited in their con-
</p>
<p>verts a high degree of religious enthusiasm ; which,
</p>
<p>directed as it was by the teachings of the mission-
</p>
<p>aries, went farther than any thing else could have
</p>
<p>done to soften their national prejudices, and wean
</p>
<p>them from their warlike habits.
</p>
<p>About three months before the massacre at Con-
</p>
<p>estoga, a party of drunken Rangers, fired by the
</p>
<p>general resentment against the Moravian Indians
</p>
<p>murdered several of them, both men and women
</p>
<p>whom they found sleeping in a barn. Not long

</p>
<p>surprised and killed, some peaceful settlers of the
</p>
<p>neighborhood sharing their fate. This act was at
</p>
<p>once ascribed, justly or unjustly, to the vengeance
</p>
<p>of the converted Indians, relatives of the murdered ;
</p>
<p>and the frontier people, who, like the Paxton
</p>
<p>men, w^ere chiefly Scotch and Irish Presbyterians,
</p>
<p>resolved that the objects of their suspicion should
</p>
<p>live no longer. At this time, the Moravian con-
</p>
<p>verts consisted of two communities, those of Nain
</p>
<p>and Wecquetank, near the Lehigh ; and to these
</p>
<p>may be added a third, at Wyalusing, near Wyo-
</p>
<p>ming. The latter, from its distant situation, was,
</p>
<p>for the present, safe ; but the two former were in
</p>
<p>imminent peril, and the inhabitants, in mortal ter-
</p>
<p>ror for their lives, stood day and night on the
</p>
<p>watch.
</p>
<p>At length, about the tenth of October, a gang
</p>
<p>of armed men approached Wecquetank, and en-
</p>
<p>camped in the woods, at no great distance. They
</p>
<p>intended to make their attack under favor of the
</p>
<p>darkness ; but before evening a storm, which to
</p>
<p>the missionaries seemed providential, descended
</p>
<p>with such violence, that the fires of the hostile
</p>
<p>camp were extinguished in a moment, the ammuni-
</p>
<p>tion of the men wet, and the plan defeated.^
</p>
<p>After so narrow an escape, it was apparent that
</p>
<p>flight was the only resource. The terrified congre-
</p>
<p>gation of Wecquetank broke up on the following
</p>
<p>day ; and, under the charge of their missionary,
</p>
<p>Bernard Grube, removed to the Moravian town of

<p>Nazareth, where it was hoped they might remain
</p>
<p>in safety.^
</p>
<p>In the mean time, the charges against the Mora
</p>
<p>vian converts had been laid before the provincial
</p>
<p>Assembly ; and, to secure the safety of the frontier
</p>
<p>people, it was judged expedient to disarm the sus
</p>
<p>pected Indians, and remove them to a part of the
</p>
<p>province where it would be beyond their power
</p>
<p>to do mischief.^ The motion was passed in the
</p>
<p>Assembly with little dissent ; the Quakers support-
</p>
<p>ing it from regard to the safety of the Indians, and
</p>
<p>their opponents from regard to the safety of the
</p>
<p>whites. The order for removal reached its destina-
</p>
<p>tion on the sixth of November ; and the Indians,
</p>
<p>reluctantly yielding up their arms, prepared for de-
</p>
<p>parture. When a sermon had been preached before
</p>
<p>the united congregations, and a hymn sung in which
</p>
<p>all took part, the unfortunate exiles set out on their
</p>
<p>forlorn pilgrimage ; the aged, the young, the sick,
</p>
<p>and the blind, borne in wagons, while the rest
</p>
<p>journeyed on foot.^ Their total number, including
</p>
<p>the band from Wyalusing, which joined them after
</p>
<p>they reached Philadelphia, was about a hundred
</p>
<p>and forty. At every village and hamlet which
</p>
<p>they passed on their way, they were greeted with
</p>
<p>threats and curses ; nor did the temper of the
</p>
<p>people improve as they advanced, for, when they
</p>
<p>came to Germantown, the mob could scarcely be
</p>
<p>restrained from attacking them. On reaching Phil-

</p>
<p>liootings of the rabble, to the barracks, which had
</p>
<p>been intended to receive them ; but the soldiers,
</p>
<p>who outdid the mob in their hatred of Indians,
</p>
<p>refused to admit them, and set the orders of the
</p>
<p>govenior at defiance. From ten o'clock in the
</p>
<p>morning until three in the afternoon, the persecuted
</p>
<p>exiles remained drawn up in the square before the
</p>
<p>barracks, surrounded by a multitude who never
</p>
<p>ceased to abuse and threaten them ; but wherever
</p>
<p>the broad hat of a Quaker was seen in the crowd,
</p>
<p>there they felt the assurance of a friend,  a friend,
</p>
<p>who, both out of love for them, and aversion to
</p>
<p>their enemies, would spare no efforts in their
</p>
<p>behalf. The soldiers continued refractory, and the
</p>
<p>Indians were at length ordered to proceed. As
</p>
<p>they moved down the street, shrinking together in
</p>
<p>their terror, the mob about them grew so angry
</p>
<p>and clamorous, that to their missionaries they
</p>
<p>seemed like a flock of sheep in the midst of howl-
</p>
<p>ing wolves.^ A body-guard of Quakers gathered
</p>
<p>around, protecting them from the crowd, and speak-
</p>
<p>ing words of sympathy and encouragement. Thus
</p>
<p>they proceeded to Province Island, below the city,
</p>
<p>where they were lodged in waste buildings, pre-
</p>
<p>pared in haste for their reception, and where the
</p>
<p>Quakers still attended them, with every office 0/
</p>
<p>kindaess and friendship.

</p>
<p>THE RIOTERS MARCH ON PHILADELPHIA.
</p>
<p>The Conestoga murders did not take place until
</p>
<p>some weeks after the removal of the Moravian
</p>
<p>converts to Philadelphia ; and the rioters, as they
</p>
<p>rode, flushed with success, out of Lancaster, after
</p>
<p>the achievement of their exploit, were heard to
</p>
<p>boast that they would soon visit the city and finish
</p>
<p>their work, by killing the Indians whom it had
</p>
<p>taken under its protection. It was soon but too
</p>
<p>apparent that this design was seriously entertained
</p>
<p>by the people of the frontier. They had tasted
</p>
<p>blood, and they craved more. It seemed to them
</p>
<p>intolerable, that, while their sufferings were un
</p>
<p>heeded, and their wounded and destitute friends
</p>
<p>uncared for, they should be taxed to support those
</p>
<p>whom they regarded as authors of their calamities,
</p>
<p>or, in their own angry words, " to maintain them
</p>
<p>through the winter, that they may scalp and butcher
</p>
<p>us in the spring." ^ In their blind rage, they would

<p>not see that the Moravian Indians had been re
</p>
<p>moved to Philadelphia, in part, at least, with a
</p>
<p>view to the safety of the borders. To their enmity
</p>
<p>against Indians was added a resentment, scarcely
</p>
<p>less vehement, against the Quakers, whoso secta
</p>
<p>rian principles they hated and despised. They
</p>
<p>complained, too, of political grievances, all(3ging
</p>
<p>that the five frontier counties were inadequately
</p>
<p>represented in the Assembly, and that from thence^
</p>
<p>arose the undue influence of the Quakers in th(
</p>
<p>councils of the province.
</p>
<p>The excited people soon began to assemble at
</p>
<p>taverns and other places of resort, recounting their
</p>
<p>grievances, real or imaginary ; relating frightful
</p>
<p>stories of Indian atrocities, and launching fierce
</p>
<p>invectives against the Quakers.^ Political agita-
</p>
<p>destitute of the necessaries of life, and are neglected by the public, is
</p>
<p>sufficient to make us mad with rage, and tempt us to do what nothing but

<p>tors harangued them on their violated rights ; self-
</p>
<p>constituted preachers urged the duty of destroying
</p>
<p>the heathen, forgetting that the Moravian Indians
</p>
<p>were Christians, and their exasperated hearers were
</p>
<p>soon ripe for any rash attempt. They resolved
</p>
<p>to assemble and march in arms to Philadelpliia.
</p>
<p>On a former occasion, they had sent thither a
</p>
<p>wagon laden with the mangled corpses of their
</p>
<p>friends and relatives, who had fallen by Indian
</p>
<p>butchery ; but the hideous spectacle had failed of
</p>
<p>the intended effect, and the Assembly had still
</p>
<p>turned a deaf ear to their entreaties for more
</p>
<p>effective aid.^ Appeals to sympathy had been
</p>
<p>thrown away, and they now^ resolved to try the
</p>
<p>efficacy of their rifles.
</p>
<p>They mustered under their popular leaders,
</p>
<p>prominent among whom was Matthew Smith, who
</p>
<p>had led the murderers at Conestoga ; and, towards
</p>
<p>the end of January, took the road to Philadelphia,
</p>
<p>* in force variously estimated at from five hundred
</p>
<p>to fifteen hundred men. Their avowed purpose
</p>
<p>was to kill the Moravian Indians ; but what vague
</p>
<p>designs they may have entertained to change the
</p>
<p>government, and eject the Quakers from a share
</p>
<p>in it, must remain a matter of uncertainty. Feeble

</p>
<p>there in December, with intent to animate the people to unite in prepa-

<p>rations for w ar on the Indians. They were carried along the streets 
</p>
<p>many people following cursing the Indians, and also the Quakers,

<p>because they would not jom m war for their destruction. The sight of

</p>
<p>as they were in numbers, their enterprise was .noi
</p>
<p>so hopeless as might at first appear, for they counted
</p>
<p>on aid from the mob of the city, while a numerous
</p>
<p>party, comprising the members of the Presbyterian
</p>
<p>sect, were expected to give them secret support,
</p>
<p>or at least to stand neutral in the quarrel. The
</p>
<p>Quakers, who were their most determined enemies,
</p>
<p>couia not take arms against them without glaring
</p>
<p>violation of the principles which they had so often
</p>
<p>and loudly professed ; and even should they thus
</p>
<p>fly in the face of conscience, the warlike borderers
</p>
<p>would stand in little fear of such unpractised war-
</p>
<p>riors. They pursued their march in high confi-
</p>
<p>dence, applauded by the inhabitants, and hourly
</p>
<p>increasing in numbers.
</p>
<p>Startling rumors of the danger soon reached
</p>
<p>Philadelphia, spreading alarm among the citizens.
</p>
<p>The Quakers, especially, had reason to fear, both
</p>
<p>for themselves and for the Indians, of whom it was
</p>
<p>their pride to be esteemed the champions. These
</p>
<p>pacific sectaries found themselves in a new and
</p>
<p>embarrassing position, for hitherto they had been
</p>
<p>able to assert their principles at no great risk to
</p>
<p>person or property. The appalling tempest, which,
</p>
<p>during the French war, had desolated the rest of
</p>
<p>the province, had been unfelt near Philadelphia;
</p>
<p>and while the inhabitants to the westward had been
</p>
<p>slaughtered by hundreds, scarcely a Quaker had
</p>
<p>been hurt. Under these circumstances, the aver-
</p>
<p>sion of the sect to warlike measures had been a
</p>
<p>fruitful source of difiiculty. It is true that, on

</p>
<p>such a testimony of inconsistency, they had grantee]
</p>
<p>the money, not for the avowed purpose of raising

<p>nd arming soldiers, but under the title of a gift to
</p>
<p>the crown.^ They were now to be deprived of
</p>
<p>even this poor subterfuge, and subjected to the
</p>
<p>dilemma of suffering their friends to be slain and
</p>
<p>themselves to be plundered, or openly appealing
</p>
<p>to arms.
</p>
<p>Their embarrassment was increased by the exag-
</p>
<p>gerated ideas which prevailed among the ignorant
</p>
<p>and timorous respecting the size and strength of
</p>
<p>the borderers, their ferocity of temper, and their
</p>
<p>wonderful skill as marksmen. Quiet citizens,
</p>
<p>whose knowledge was confined to the narrow

<p>limits of their firesides and shops, listened hor

</p>
<p>as the place was defenceless, no other expedient

<p>suggested itself than the pitiful one of removing

<p>the objects of popular resentment beyond reach of

<p>all haste downi the river ; but, the rumor proving
</p>
<p>groundless, a messenger was despatched to recall
</p>
<p>the fugitives.^ The assurance that, for a time at
</p>
<p>least, the city was safe, restored some measure of
</p>
<p>tranquillity ; but, as intelligence of an alarming
</p>
<p>kind came in daily from the country, Governoi

<p>and, in the interval, means to avert the threatened

<p>before the Assembly to embark the Indians and
</p>
<p>send them to England : ^ but the scheme ^vas
</p>
<p>judged inexpedient, and another, of equal w(;ak

<p>mournful procession, thinly clad and shivering
</p>
<p>with cold, through the silent" streets. The Mora-
</p>
<p>vian Brethren supplied them with food ; and Fox,
</p>
<p>the commissary, with great humanity, distributed
</p>
<p>blankets among them. Before they could resume
</p>
<p>their progress, the city was astir ; and as they
</p>
<p>passed the suburbs, they were pelted and hooted
</p>
<p>at by the mob. Captain Robertson's Highlanders,
</p>
<p>who had just arrived from Lancaster, were ordered
</p>
<p>to escort them. These soldiers, who had their
</p>
<p>own reasons for hating Indians, treated them at
</p>
<p>first with no less insolence and rudeness than the
</p>
<p>populace ; but at length, overcome by the meek
</p>
<p>ness and patience of the sufferers, they changed
</p>
<p>their conduct, and assumed a tone of sympathy and
</p>
<p>kindness.^
</p>
<p>Thus escorted, the refugees pursued their dreary
</p>
<p>progress through the country, greeted on all sides
</p>
<p>by the threats and curses of the people. When
</p>
<p>they reached Trenton, they were received by Apty,
</p>
<p>the commissary at that place, under whose charge
</p>
<p>they continued their journey towards Amboy, where
</p>
<p>several small vessels had been provided to carry
</p>
<p>them to New York. Arriving at Amboy, however,
</p>
<p>Apty, to his great surprise, received a letter from
</p>
<p>Governor Golden of New York, forbidding him to
</p>
<p>bring the Indians within the limits of that province.
</p>
<p>A second letter, from General Gage to Captaiu

<p>bring the Indians to the city.^ The charges of
</p>
<p>treadiery against the Moravian Indians, the burden
</p>
<p>their presence would occasion, and the danger of
</p>
<p>popular disturbance, were the chief causes which
</p>
<p>induced the government of New York to adopt this
</p>
<p>course ; a course that might have been foreseen
</p>
<p>from the beginning.^
</p>
<p>Thus disappointed in their hopes of escape, the
</p>
<p>hapless Indians remained several days lodged in
</p>
<p>the barracks at Amboy, where they passed much
</p>
<p>of their time in religious services. A message,
</p>
<p>however, soon came from the Governor of New
</p>
<p>Jersey, requiring them to leave that province ; and
</p>
<p>they were compelled reluctantly to retrace their
</p>
<p>steps to Philadelphia. A detachment of a hun-
</p>
<p>dred and seventy soldiers had arrived, sent by
</p>
<p>General Gage in compliance with the request of
</p>
<p>Governor Penn ; and under the protection of these
</p>
<p>troops, the exiles began their backward journey.
</p>
<p>On the twenty-fourth of January, they reached

<p>racks within the city; the soldiers, forgetful of
</p>
<p>former prejudice, no longer refusing them entrance.
</p>
<p>The return of the Indians, banishing the hope
</p>
<p>of repose with which the citizens had flattered
</p>
<p>themselves, and the tidings of danger coming in
</p>
<p>quick succession from the country, made it appar-
</p>
<p>ent that no time must be lost ; and the Assembly,
</p>
<p>laying aside their scruples, unanimously passed a
</p>
<p>bill providing means for the public defence. The
</p>
<p>pacific city displayed a scene of unwonted bustle.
</p>
<p>All who held property, or regarded the public
</p>
<p>order, might, it should seem, have felt a deep
</p>
<p>interest in the issue ; yet a numerous and highly
</p>
<p>respectable class stood idle spectators, or showed
</p>
<p>at best but a lukewarm zeal. These were the Pres-
</p>
<p>byterians, who had naturally felt a strong sympathy
</p>
<p>with their suffering brethren of the frontier. To
</p>
<p>this they added a deep bitterness against the Quak-
</p>
<p>ers, greatly increased by a charge, most uncharitably
</p>
<p>JtTrought by the latter against the whole Presbyterian
</p>
<p>\ sect, of conniving at and abetting the murders at
</p>
<p>NConestoga and Lancaster. They regarded the
</p>
<p>mxton men as victims of Quaker neglect and
</p>
<p>injustice, and showed a strong disposition to pal-
</p>
<p>liate, or excuse altogether, the violence of which
</p>
<p>they had been guilty. Many of them, indeed, were
</p>
<p>secretly inclined to favor the designs of the advan-
</p>
<p>cing rioters ; hoping that by their means the public
</p>
<p>grievances would be redressed, the Quaker faction
</p>
<p>j)ut down, and the social and political balance of
</p>
<p>the state restored.^

</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the sentiments of the
</p>
<p>Presbyterians and of the city mob, the rest of the
</p>
<p>inhabitants bestirred themselves for defence with
</p>
<p>all the alacrity of fright. The Quakers were espe-
</p>
<p>cially conspicuous for their zeal. Nothing more
</p>
<p>was heard of tlie duty of non-resistance. The city
</p>
<p>was ransacked for arms, and the Assembly passei!
</p>
<p>a vote, extending the English riot act to the prov-
</p>
<p>ince, the Quaker members heartily concurring in
</p>
<p>the measure. Franklin, whose energy and practi-
</p>
<p>cal talents made his services invaluable, was the
</p>
<p>moving spirit of the day ; and under his auspices
</p>
<p>the citizens were formed into military companies,
</p>
<p>six of which were of infantry, one of artillery, and
</p>
<p>two of horse. Besides this force, several thousands
</p>
<p>of the inhabitants, including many Quakers, held
</p>
<p>themselves ready to appear in arms at a moment's
</p>
<p>notice.^
</p>
<p>These preparations were yet incomplete, when,
</p>
<p>on the fourth of February, cormers came in with
</p>
<p>the announcement that the Paxton men, horse and
</p>
<p>foot, were already within a short distance of the
</p>
<p>city. Proclamation was made through the streets,
</p>
<p>and the people were called to arms. A mob of
</p>
<p>citizen soldiers repaired in great excitement to the
</p>
<p>barracks, where the Indians were lodged, under pro-
</p>
<p>tection of the handrtd of regulars. Here the crowd
</p>
<p>remained all night, drenched with the rain, and in
</p>
<p>a dismal condition.^

<p>thrown up across the great square enclosed by the
</p>
<p>barracks ; and eight cannon, to which four more
</p>
<p>were afterwards added, were planted to sweep the
</p>
<p>adjacent streets. These pieces were discharged,
</p>
<p>to convey to the rioters an idea of the reception
</p>
<p>prepared for them ; but whatever effect the explo-
</p>
<p>sion may have produced on the ears for which it
</p>
<p>was intended, the new and appalling sounds struck
</p>
<p>the Indians in the barracks with speechless terror.*
</p>
<p>While the city assumed this martial attitude, its
</p>
<p>rulers thought proper to adopt the safer though
</p>
<p>less glorious course of conciliation ; and a deputa-
</p>
<p>tion of clergymen was sent out to meet the rioters,
</p>
<p>and pacify them by reason and Scripture. Towards
</p>
<p>night, as all remained quiet and nothing was heard
</p>
<p>from the enemy, the turmoil began to subside, the
</p>
<p>citizen soldiers dispersed, the regulars withdrew
</p>
<p>into quarters, and the city recovered something of
</p>
<p>the ordinary repose of a Sabbath evening.
</p>
<p>Through the early part of the night, the quiet
</p>
<p>was undisturbed ; but at about two o'clock in the
</p>
<p>morning, the clang of bells and the rolling of drums
</p>
<p>startled the people from their slumbers, and count-
</p>
<p>less voices from the street echoed the alarm. Im-
</p>
<p>mediately, in obedience to the previous day's orders,
</p>
<p>lighted candles were placed in every window, till
</p>
<p>the streets seemed illuminated for a festival. The
</p>
<p>citizen soldiers, with more zeal than order, mustered
</p>
<p>under their officers. The governor, dreading an
</p>
<p>irruption of the mob, repaired to the house of
</p>
<p>Franklin ; and the city was filled with the jangling

<p>of bells, and the no less vehement clamor of
</p>
<p>tongues. A great multitude gathered before the
</p>
<p>barracks, where it was supposed the attack would
</p>
<p>be made ; and among them was seen many a Quak-
</p>
<p>er, with musket in hand. Some of the more con-
</p>
<p>sistent of the sect, unwilling to take arms with
</p>
<p>their less scrupulous brethren, went into the bar-
</p>
<p>racks to console and reassure the Indians ; who,
</p>
<p>however, showed much more composure than their
</p>
<p>comforters, and sat waiting the result with invin-
</p>
<p>cible calmness. Several hours of suspense and
</p>
<p>excitement passed, when it was recollected, that,
</p>
<p>though the other ferries of the Schuylkill had been
</p>
<p>secured, a crossing place, known as the Swedes'
</p>
<p>Ford, had been left open ; and a party at once set
</p>
<p>out to correct this unlucky oversight.^ Scarcely
</p>
<p>were they gone, when a cry rose among the crowd
</p>
<p>before the barracks, and a general exclamation was
</p>
<p>heard that the Paxton Boys were coming. In fact,
</p>
<p>a band of horsemen was seen advancing up Second
</p>
<p>Street. The people crowded to get out of the way ;
</p>
<p>the troops fell into such order as they could ; a
</p>
<p>cannon was pointed full at the horsemen, and the
</p>
<p>gunner was about to apply the match, when a man
</p>
<p>ran out from the crowd, and covered the touchhole
</p>
<p>with his hat. The cry of a false alarm was heard,
</p>
<p>and it was soon apparent to all that the supposed
</p>
<p>Paxton Boys were a troop of German butchers and
</p>
<p>carters, who had come to aid in defence of the city,
</p>
<p>and had nearly paid dear for their patriotic zeal.*

<p>146 RIOTERS MARCH ON PHILADELPHIA. [1764, Feb
</p>
<p>The tumult of this alarm was hardly over, when
</p>
<p>a fresh commotion was raised by the return of the
</p>
<p>men who had gone to secure the Swedes' Ford,
</p>
<p>and who reported that they had been too late ;
</p>
<p>that the rioters had crossed the river, and were
</p>
<p>already at Germantown. Those who had crossed
</p>
<p>proved to be the van of the Paxton men two
</p>
<p>hundred in number, and commanded by Matlhe^^
</p>
<p>Smith ; who, learning what welcome was prepared
</p>
<p>for them, thought it prudent to remain quietly at
</p>
<p>Geiimantown, instead of marching forward to cer-
</p>
<p>tain destruction. In the afternoon, many of the
</p>
<p>inhabitants gathered courage, and went out to visit
</p>
<p>them. They found nothing very extraordinary in
</p>
<p>the aspect of the rioters, who, in the words of a
</p>
<p>writer of the day, were " a set of fellows in blanket
</p>
<p>coats and moccasons, like our Indian traders or
</p>
<p>back country wagoners, all armed with rifles and
</p>
<p>tomahawks, and some with pistols stuck in their
</p>
<p>belts." ^ They received their visitors with a cour-
</p>
<p>tesy which might doubtless be ascribed, in great
</p>
<p>measure, to their knowledge of the warlike prepa-
</p>

</p>
<p>The best remaining account of tliese riots will be found under the
</p>
<p>first authority cited above. It consists of a long letter, written in a very
</p>
<p>animated strain, by a Quaker to his friend, containing a detailed account
</p>
<p>of what passed in the city from the first alarm of the rioters to the con-
</p>
<p>clusion of the affair. The writer, though a Quaker, is free from the
</p>
<p>prejudices of his sect, nor does he hesitate to notice the inconsistency of
</p>
<p>his brethren appearing in arms. See Appendix, E.
</p>
<p>The scene before the barracks, and the narrow escape of the German

<p>butchers, was made the subject of several poems and farces, written by

</p>
<p>rations within the city ; and the report made by the
</p>
<p>adventurers, on their return, greatly tended to allay
</p>
<p>the general excitement.
</p>
<p>The alarm, however, was again raised on the
</p>
<p>following day ; and the cry to arms once more
</p>
<p>resounded through the city of peace. The citizen
</p>
<p>soldiers mustered with exemplary despatch ; but
</p>
<p>their ardor was quenched by a storm of rain, which
</p>
<p>drove them all under shelter. A neighboring
</p>
<p>Quaker meeting-house happened to be open, and a
</p>
<p>company of the volunteers betook themselves in
</p>
<p>haste to this convenient asylum. Forthwith, the
</p>
<p>place was bristling with bayonets ; and the walls,
</p>
<p>which had listened so often to angry denunciations
</p>
<p>against war, now echoed the clang of weapons, 
</p>
<p>an unspeakable scandal to the elders of the sect,
</p>
<p>and an occasion of pitiless satire to the Presbyte-
</p>
<p>rians.^
</p>
<p>This alarm proving groundless, like all the others,
</p>
<p>the governor and council proceeded to the execu-
</p>
<p>tion of a design which they had formed the day
</p>
<p>before. They had resolved, in pursuance of their
</p>
<p>timid policy, to open negotiations with the rioterj,
</p>
<p>and persuade them, if possible, to depart peacefull}.
</p>
<p>Many of the citizens protested against the plan,
</p>
<p>and the soldiers volunteered to attack the Paxton
</p>
<p>men; but none were so vehement as the Quakers
</p>
<p>who held that fire and steel were the only w^el-
</p>
<p>come that should be accorded to such violators of

<p>society of Friends.^ The plan was nevertheless
</p>
<p>sustamed ; and Franklin, with three other citizens
</p>
<p>of character and influence, set out for German-
</p>
<p>town. The rioters received them with marks of
</p>
<p>respect ; and, after a long conference, the leaders
</p>
<p>of the mob were so far wrought upon as to give
</p>
<p>over their hostile designs, the futility of which
</p>
<p>was now sufficiently apparent.^ An assurance was
</p>
<p>given, on the part of the government, that their
</p>
<p>complaints should have a hearing ; and safety was
</p>
<p>guarantied to those of their number who should
</p>
<p>enter the city as their representatives and advo-
</p>
<p>cates. For this purpose, Matthew Smith and
</p>
<p>James Gibson were appointed by the general
</p>
<p>voice; and two papers, a "Declaration" and a
</p>
<p>" Remonstrance," were drawn up, addressed to the
</p>
<p>governor and Assembly. With this assurance that
</p>
<p>their cause should be represented, the rioters sig-
</p>
<p>nified their willingness to return home, glad to
</p>
<p>escape so easily from an affair which had begun to
</p>
<p>threaten worse consequences.
</p>
<p>^ Towards evening, the commissioners, returning
</p>
<p>to the city, reported the success of their negotia-
</p>
<p>tions. Upon this, the citizen soldiers were convened
</p>
<p>in front of the court house, and addressed by a
</p>
<p>member of the council. He thanked them for
</p>
<p>their zeal, and assured them there was no farther

<p>design than that of gaining relief to their suffer-

</p>
<p>The people, ill satisfied with what they heard,

<p>returned in no placid temper to their homes. ^ On

<p>the morrow, the good effect of the treaty was appar-

<p>Paxton Boys had broken the treaty and were enter
</p>
<p>ing the town, startled the indignant citizens. The
</p>
<p>streets were filled in an instant wdth a rabble of
</p>
<p>armed merchants and shopmen, who for once were
</p>
<p>fully bent on slaughter, and resolved to put an
</p>
<p>end to the long-protracted evil. Quiet was again
</p>
<p>restored ; when it was found that the alarm was
</p>
<p>caused by about thirty of the frontiersmen, who,
</p>
<p>with singular audacity, were riding into the city
</p>
<p>on a visit of curiosity. As their deportment was
</p>
<p>moffensive, it was thought unwise to molest them.
</p>
<p>Several of these visitors had openly boasted of the
</p>
<p>part they had taken in the Conestoga murders,
</p>
<p>and a large reward had been offered for their
</p>
<p>apprehension ; yet such was the state of factions

<p>in the city, and such the dread of the frontiersmen,

<p>that no man dared lay hand on the criminals. The

<p>party proceeded to the barracks, where they re-
</p>
<p>quested to see the Indians, declarmg that they could
</p>
<p>f)omt out several who had been m the battle against
</p>
<p>Colonel Bouquet, or engaged in other acts of open
</p>
<p>hostility. The request was granted, but no discov
</p>
<p>ery made. Upon this, it was rumored abroad thai
</p>
<p>the Quakers had removed the guilty individuals to
</p>
<p>screen them from just punishment ; an accusation
</p>
<p>which, for a time, excited much ill blood ])etween
</p>
<p>the rival factions.
</p>
<p>The thirty frontiersmen withdrew from the city,
</p>
<p>and soon followed the example of their compan-
</p>
<p>ions, who had begun to move homeward, leaving
</p>
<p>their leaders, Smith and Gibson, to adjust their
</p>
<p>differences with the government. Their departure
</p>
<p>gave great relief to the people of the neighborhood,
</p>
<p>to whom they had, at times, conducted themselves
</p>
<p>after a fashion somewhat uncivil and barbarous 
</p>
<p>uttering hideous outcries, in imitation of the war
</p>
<p>whoop ; knocking down peaceable citizens, and
</p>
<p>pretending to scalp them ; thrusting their guns in
</p>
<p>at windows, and committing unheard-of ravages
</p>
<p>among hen-roosts and hog-pens.^
</p>
<p>Though the city was now safe from all external
</p>
<p>danger, contentions sprang up within its precincts,
</p>
<p>which, though by no means as perilous, were not
</p>
<p>less clamorous and angry than those menaced from
</p>
<p>an uTuption of the rioters.^ The rival factions

<p>turned savagely upon each other ; while the more
</p>
<p>philosophic citizens stood laughing by, and ridi-
</p>
<p>culed them both. The Presbyterians grew furious
</p>
<p>the Quakers dogged and spiteful. Pamphlets,
</p>
<p>farces, dialogues, and poems came forth in quick
</p>
<p>succession. These sometimes exhibited a few
</p>
<p>traces of wit, and even of reasoning ; but abuse

<p>was the favorite weapon, and it is difficult to say
</p>

<p>with the Quakers, I was entirely on the side of humanity and public duty,
</p>
<p>(or in this do I beg the question?) and perfectly recollect my indignation
</p>
<p>at the sentiments of one of the ushers who was on the opposite side. His
</p>
<p>name was Davis, and he was really a kind, good-natured man ; yet from
</p>
<p>the dominion of his religious or political prejudices, he had been led to
</p>
<p>apologize for, if not to approve of an outrage, which was a disgrace to a
</p>
<p>civiUzed people. He had been among the riflemen on their coming into
</p>
<p>the city, and, talking with them upon the subject of the Lancaster mas-
</p>
<p>sacre, and particularly t)f the killing of Will Sock, the most distinguished
</p>
<p>of the victims, related with an air of approbation, this rodomontade of the
</p>
<p>real or pretended murderer. ' I,' said he, ' am the man who killed Will

<p>accused the Presbyterians of conniving at the act
</p>
<p>of murderers, of perverting Scripture for their
</p>
<p>defence, and of aiding the rioters with counsel and
</p>
<p>money in their audacious attempt against the pub-
</p>
<p>lic peace. The Presbyterians, on their part, with
</p>
<p>about equal justice, charged the Quakers with
</p>
<p>leaguing themselves with the common enemy and
</p>
<p>exciting them to war. They held up to scorn those
</p>
<p>accommodating principles which denied the aid of
</p>
<p>arms to sulfering fellow-countrymen, but justified
</p>
<p>their use at the first call of self-interest. The
</p>
<p>Quaker warrior, in his sober garb of ostentatious
</p>
<p>simplicity, his prim person adorned with military
</p>
<p>trappings, and his hands grasping a musket which
</p>
<p>threatened more peril to himself than to his enemy,
</p>
<p>was a subject of ridicule too tempting to be over-
</p>
<p>looked.
</p>
<p>While this paper warfare was raging in the city,
</p>
<p>the representatives of the frontiersmen, Smith and
</p>
<p>Gibson, had laid before the Assembly the memorial,
</p>
<p>entitled the Remonstrance ; and to this a second
</p>
<p>paper, styled a Declaration, was soon afterwards
</p>
<p>added.^ Various grievances were specified, for
</p>
<p>which redress was demanded. It was urged that
</p>
<p>the Title tlierefore is a deception, and the contents manifestly false : m
</p>
<p>short, I have carefully examined it, and find in it no less than 17 Positive
</p>
<p>Lies, and 10 false Insinuations contained in 15 pages, Monstrous, and from

<p>those counties where the Quaker interest prevailed

<p>sent to the Assembly more than their due share of
</p>
<p>representatives. The memorialists bitterly com-
</p>
<p>plained of a law, then before the Assembly, by
</p>
<p>which those charged with murdering Indians were
</p>
<p>to be brought to trial, not in the district where the
</p>
<p>act was committed, but in one of the three eastorii
</p>
<p>counties. They represented the Moravian converts
</p>
<p>as enemies in disguise, and denounced the policy <L
</p>
<p>which yielded them protection and support while
</p>
<p>the sick and wounded of the frontiers were cruelly
</p>
<p>abandoned to their misery. They begged that a
</p>
<p>suitable reward might be offered for scalps, since
</p>
<p>the want of such encouragpment had " dampe
</p>
<p>the spirits of many brave men." Angry invectives
</p>
<p>against the Quakers succeeded. To the " villany,
</p>
<p>infatuation, and influence of a certain faction, that
</p>
<p>have got the political reins in their hands, and
</p>
<p>tamely tyrannize over the other good subjects of
</p>
<p>the province," were to be ascribed, urged the
</p>
<p>memorialists, the intolerable evils which afflicted
</p>
<p>the people. The Quakers, they insisted, had held
</p>
<p>private treaties with the Indians, encouraged them
</p>
<p>to hostile acts, and excused their cruelties on the
</p>
<p>charitable plea that this was their method of mak-
</p>
<p>ing war.
</p>
<p>The memorials were laid before a committee,
</p>
<p>who recommended that a public conference should
</p>
<p>be held with Smith and Gibson, to consider the
</p>
<p>grounds of complaint. To this the governor, in

</p>
<p>had he made it when the rioters were in arms
</p>
<p>before the city, at which time he had shown an
</p>
<p>abundant alacrity to negotiate. It was intimated
</p>
<p>to Smith and Gibson that they might leave Phila-
</p>
<p>delphia ; and the Assembly soon after became
</p>
<p>involved in its inevitable quarrels with the gov-
</p>
<p>ernor, relative to the granting of supplies for the
</p>
<p>service of the ensuing campaign. The supply bill
</p>
<p>passed, as mentioned in a former chapter ; and the
</p>
<p>consequent military preparations, together with a
</p>
<p>threatened renewal of the war on the part of the
</p>
<p>enemy, engrossed the minds of the frontier people,
</p>
<p>and caused the excitements of the winter to be
</p>
<p>forgotten. No action on the two memorials was
</p>
<p>ever taken by the Assembly ; and the memorable
</p>
<p>Paxton riots had no other definite result than that
</p>
<p>of exposing the weakness and distraction of the

<p>provincial government, and demonstrating the folly

<p>BRADSTREET'S ARMY ON THE LAKES.
</p>
<p>The campaign of 1763, a year of disaster to the
</p>
<p>English colonies, was throughout of a defensive
</p>
<p>nature, and no important blow had been struck
</p>
<p>against the enemy. With the opening of the fol
</p>
<p>lowing spring, preparations were made to renew
</p>
<p>the war on a more decisive plan. Before the com
</p>
<p>mencement of hostilities, Sir William Johnson and
</p>
<p>his deputy, George Croghan, severally addressed to
</p>
<p>the lords of trade memorials, setting forth the char-
</p>
<p>acter, temper, and resources of the Indian tribes, and
</p>
<p>suggesting the course of conduct which they judged
</p>
<p>it expedient to pursue. They represented that,
</p>
<p>before the conquest of Canada, all the tribes, jeal
</p>
<p>ous of French encroachment, had looked to the
</p>
<p>English to befriend and protect them ; but that
</p>
<p>now one general feeling of distrust and luitred
</p>
<p>filled them all. They added that the neglect and
</p>
<p>injustice of tlie British government, the outrages
</p>
<p>of ruffian borderers and debauched traders, and
</p>
<p>the insolence of English soldiers, had aggravated

</p>
<p>machinations of the defeated French; \^ho, to
</p>
<p>revenge themselves on their conquerors, were con-
</p>
<p>stantly stirring up the Indians to war. A race so
</p>
<p>brave and tenacious of liberty, so wild and erratic
</p>
<p>in their habits, dwelling in a country so savage and
</p>
<p>inaccessible, could not be exterminated or reduced
</p>
<p>to subjection without an immoderate expenditure
</p>
<p>of men, money, and time. The true policy of the
</p>
<p>British government was therefore to conciliate ; to
</p>
<p>soothe their jealous pride, galled by injuries and
</p>
<p>insults ; to gratify them by presents, and treat
</p>
<p>them with a respect and attention to which their
</p>
<p>haughty spirit would not fail to respond. We
</p>
<p>ought, they said, to make the Indians our friends ;
</p>
<p>and, by a just, consistent, and straightforward
</p>
<p>course, seek to gain their esteem, and wean them
</p>
<p>from their partiality to the French. To remove the
</p>
<p>constant irritation which arose from the intrusion
</p>
<p>of the white inhabitants on their territory, Croghan
</p>
<p>urged the expediency of purchasing a large tract
</p>
<p>of land to the westward of the English settlements ;
</p>
<p>thus confining the tribes to remoter hunting-grounds.
</p>
<p>For a moderate sum the Indians would part with as
</p>
<p>much land as might be required. A little more,
</p>
<p>laid out in annual presents, would keep them in
</p>
<p>good temper ; and by judicious management all
</p>
<p>hostile collision might be prevented, till, by the
</p>
<p>extension of the settlements, it should become
</p>
<p>expedient to make yet another purchase.^
</p>
<p>This plan was afterwards carried into execution
</p>
<p>by the British government. Founded as it is upon

<p>the supposition that the Indian tribes must gradually
</p>
<p>dwindle and waste away, it might well have awak
</p>
<p>ened the utmost fears of that unhappy people.
</p>
<p>Yet none but an enthusiast or fanatic could con-
</p>
<p>demn it as iniquitous. To reclaim the Indians
</p>
<p>from their savage state has again and again been
</p>
<p>attempted, and each attempt has failed. Theii
</p>
<p>intractable, unchanging character leaves no other
</p>
<p>alternative than their gradual extinction, or the
</p>
<p>abandonment of the western world to eternal bar-
</p>
<p>barism ; and of this and other similar plans,
</p>
<p>whether the offspring of British or American
</p>
<p>legislation, it may alike be said that sentimental
</p>
<p>philanthropy will find it easier to cavil at than to
</p>
<p>amend them.
</p>
<p>Now, turning from the Indians, let us observe
</p>
<p>the temper of those whose present business it was
</p>
<p>to cudgel them into good behavior ; that is to say,
</p>
<p>the J^ritish officers, of high and low degree. They
</p>
<p>seem to have been in a mood of universal discon
</p>
<p>tent, not in the least surprising when one consid-
</p>
<p>ers that they were forced to wage, with crippled
</p>
<p>resources, an arduous, profitless, and inglorious
</p>
<p>war ; w^hile perverse and jealous legislatures added
</p>
<p>gall to their bitterness, and taxed their patience
</p>
<p>to its utmost endurance. The impossible require-
</p>
<p>ments of the commander-in-chief were sometimes
</p>
<p>joined to their other vexations. Sir Jeffrey

<p>unreasonable in his anticipations of a prompt

</p>
<p>no sooner heard of the loss of Michillimackinac,
</p>
<p>Miami, and other western outposts, than he sent
</p>
<p>orders to Gladwyn to re-establish them at once.
</p>
<p>Gladwyn, who had scarcely force enough tr main-
</p>
<p>tain himself at Detroit, thereupon writes to hia
</p>
<p>friend Bouquet: "The last I received from the
</p>
<p>General is of the second July, in which I am
</p>
<p>ordered to establish the outposts immediately. At
</p>
<p>the time I received these orders, I knew it was
</p>
<p>impossible to comply with any part of them : the
</p>
<p>event shows I was right. I am heartily wearied of
</p>
<p>my command, and I have signitied the same to
</p>
<p>Colonel Amherst (Sir Jeffrey's adjutant). I hope
</p>
<p>I shall be relieved soon ; if not, I intend to quit
</p>
<p>the service, for I would not choose to be any longei
</p>
<p>exposed to the villany and treachery of the settle

<p>ment and Indians."

<p>Two or three weeks before the above was written

<p>George Croghan, Sir William Johnson's deputy,

<p>who had long lived on the frontier, and was
</p>

<p>gave my reasons for so doing. Had I continued,
</p>
<p>I could be of no more service than I have
</p>
<p>been these eighteen months past ; which was none
</p>
<p>at all, as no regard was had to any intelligence I
</p>
<p>sent, no more than to my opinion." Croghan, who
</p>
<p>could not be spared, was induced, on Gage's acces-
</p>
<p>sion to the command, to withdraw his resignation
</p>
<p>and retain his post.
</p>
<p>Next, we have a series of complaints from Lieu
</p>
<p>tenant Blane of Fort Ligonier ; who congratulates
</p>
<p>Bouquet on his recent victory at Bushy E,un, and
</p>
<p>adds : " I have now to beg that I may not be left
</p>
<p>any longer in this forlorn way, for I can assure you
</p>
<p>the fatigue I have gone through begins to get the
</p>
<p>oetter of me. I must therefore beg that you will
</p>
<p>appoint me, by the return of the convoy, a proper
</p>
<p>garrison. . . . My present situation is fifty times
</p>
<p>worse than ever." And again, on the seventeenth
</p>
<p>of September : " I must beg leave to recommend to
</p>
<p>your particular attention the sick soldiers here ; as
</p>
<p>there is neither surgeon nor medicine, it would
</p>
<p>really be charity to order them up. 1 must also
</p>
<p>beg leave to ask what you intend to do with the
</p>
<p>poor starved militia, who have neither shirts, shoes,
</p>
<p>nor any thing else. I am sorry you can do nothing
</p>
<p>for the poor inhabitants. ... I really get heartily
</p>
<p>tired of this post." He endured it some two months
</p>
<p>more, and then breaks out again on the twenty-
</p>
<p>fourth of November : " I intend going home by the
</p>
<p>first opportunity, being pretty much tired of a service
</p>
<p>that's so little worth any man's time ; and the more

</p>
<p>Now follow the letters, written in French, of the
</p>
<p>gallant Swiss, Captain Ecuyer, always lively and
</p>
<p>entertaining even in his discontent. He writes to
</p>
<p>l]onquet from Bedford, on the thirteenth of Novem-
</p>
<p>ber. Like other officers on the frontier, he com-
</p>
<p>plains of the settlers, who, notwithstanding theii
</p>
<p>fear of the enemy, always did their best to shelter
</p>
<p>deserters ; and he gives a list of eighteen soldiers
</p>
<p>who had deserted within five days : ^ " I have been
</p>
<p>twenty-two years in service, and I never in my life
</p>
<p>saw any thing equal to it,  a gang of mutineers,
</p>
<p>bandits, cut-throats, especially the grenadiers. I
</p>
<p>have been obliged, after all the patience imagin-
</p>
<p>able, to have two of them whipped on the spot,
</p>
<p>without court-martial. One wanted to kill the ser-
</p>
<p>geant and the other wanted to kill me. . . . For
</p>
<p>God's sake, let me go and raise cabbages. You
</p>
<p>can do it if you will, and I shall thank you eter*
</p>
<p>nally for it. Don't refuse, I beg you. Besides, my
</p>
<p>health is not very good ; and I don't know if I can
</p>
<p>go up again to Fort Pitt with this convoy."
</p>
<p>Bouquet himself was no better satisfied than his
</p>
<p>correspondents. On the twentieth of June, 1764,
</p>
<p>he wrote to Gage, Amherst's successor : " I flatter
</p>
<p>myself that you wall do me the favor to have me
</p>
<p>1 " The three companies of Royal Americans were reduced when I met
</p>
<p>them at Lancaster to 55 men, having lost 38 by desertion in my short
</p>
<p>absence. I look upon Sir Jeffrey Amherst's Orders forbidding me to
</p>
<p>continue to discharge as usual the men whose time of service was expired,
</p>
<p>and keeping us for seven years in the Woods,  as the occasion of this
</p>
<p>unprecedented desertion. The encouragement given everywhere in thia

<p>relieved from this command, the burden and
</p>
<p>fatigues of which I begin ta feel my strength
</p>
<p>very unequal to."
</p>
<p>Gage knew better than to relieve him, and Bou
</p>
<p>quet was forced to resign himself to another year
</p>
<p>of bush-fighting. The plan of the summer's can:-
</p>
<p>[)aign had been settled ; and he was to be the most
</p>
<p>important, if not the most conspicuous, actor in it
</p>
<p>It had been resolved to march two armies from
</p>
<p>difterent points into the heart of the Indian coun-
</p>
<p>try. The first, under Bouquet, was to advance
</p>
<p>from Fort Pitt into the midst of the Delaware and
</p>
<p>Shawanoe settlements of the valley of the Ohio.
</p>
<p>The other, under Colonel Bradstreet, was to pass
</p>
<p>up the lakes, and force the tribes of Detroit, and
</p>
<p>the regions beyond, to unconditional submission.
</p>
<p>The name of Bradstreet was already well known
</p>
<p>in America. At a dark and ill-omened period of
</p>
<p>the French war, he had crossed Lake Ontario with
</p>
<p>a force of three thousand provincials, and captured
</p>
<p>Fort Frontenac, a formidable stronghold of the
</p>
<p>French, commanding the outlet of the lake. He
</p>
<p>had distinguished himself, moreover, by his gallant
</p>
<p>conduct in a skirmish with the French and Indians
</p>
<p>on the River Oswego. These exploits had gainf d
</p>
<p>for him a reputation beyond his merits. He was a
</p>
<p>man of more activity than judgment, self-willed,
</p>
<p>vain, and eager for notoriety ; qualities which
</p>
<p>became sufficiently apparent before the end of
</p>
<p>the campaign.^

<p>1764, June] DEPARTURE OF BRADSTREET. 103
</p>
<p>Several of the northern provinces furnished
</p>
<p>troops for the expedition; but these levies did not
</p>
<p>arrive until after the appointed time ; and, as the
</p>
<p>service promised neither honor nor advantage, they
</p>
<p>were of very indifferent quality, looking, according
</p>
<p>to an officer of the expedition, more like candidates
</p>
<p>for a hospital than like men fit for the arduous duty
</p>
<p>before them. The rendezvous of the troops was
</p>
<p>at Albany, and thence they took their departure
</p>
<p>about the end of June. Adopting the usual mili-
</p>
<p>tary route to the westw^ard, they passed up the
</p>
<p>Mohawk, crossed the Oneida Lake, and descended
</p>
<p>the Onondaga. The boats and bateaux, crowded
</p>
<p>with men, passed between the war-w^orn defences
</p>
<p>of Osw^ego, which guarded the mouth of the river
</p>
<p>on either hand, and, issuing forth upon Lake Onta-
</p>
<p>rio, steered in long procession over its restless
</p>
<p>waters. A storm threw the flotilla into confusion ;
</p>
<p>and several days elapsed before the ramparts of
</p>
<p>Fort Niagara rose in sight, breaking the tedious
</p>
<p>monotony of the forest-covered shores. The troops
</p>
<p>landed beneath its walls. The surrounding plains
</p>
<p>were soon dotted with the white tents of the little

<p>army, whose strength, far inferior to the original

<p>design, did not exceed twelve hundred men.

<p>military character. His remarks, however, have reference solely to the
</p>
<p>capture of Fort Frontenac ; and he seems to have derived his impressions
</p>
<p>*rom the public prints, as he had no personal knowledge of Bradstreet.
</p>
<p>Ihe view expressed above is derived from the letters of Bradstreet him-
</p>
<p>self, from the correspondence of General Gage and Sir William Johnson,
</p>
<p>and from a MS. paper containing numerous details of his conduct during
</p>
<p>the campaign of 1764, and drawn up by the officers who served under
</p>
<p>him.

</p>
<p>A striking spectacle greeted them on their laud-
</p>
<p>ing. Hundreds of Indian cabins were clustered
</p>
<p>along the skirts of the forest, and a countless mul-
</p>
<p>titude of savages, in all the picturesque variety of
</p>
<p>their barbaric costume, were roaming over the
</p>
<p>fields, or lounging about the shores of the lake.
</p>
<p>Towards the close of the previous winter, Sir Wil
</p>
<p>liam Johnson had despatched Indian messengers
</p>
<p>to the tribes far and near, warning them of the
</p>
<p>impending blow ; and urging all who were friendly
</p>
<p>to the English, or disposed to make peace while
</p>
<p>there was yet time, to meet him at Niagara, and
</p>
<p>listen to his words. Throughout the winter, the
</p>
<p>sufferings of the Indians had been great and gen-
</p>
<p>eral. The suspension of the fur-trade ; the con-
</p>
<p>sequent want of ammunition, clothing, and other
</p>
<p>articles of necessity ; the failure of expected aid
</p>
<p>from the French ; and, above all, the knowledge
</p>
<p>that some of their own people had taken up arms
</p>
<p>for the English, combined to quench their thirst
</p>
<p>for war. Johnson's messengers had therefore been
</p>
<p>received with unexpected favor, and many had
</p>
<p>complied with his invitation. Some came to pro-
</p>
<p>test their friendship for the English ; others hoped,
</p>
<p>by an early submission, to atone for past miscon-
</p>
<p>duct. Some came as spies ; while others, again,
</p>
<p>were lured by the hope of receiving presents, and
</p>
<p>especially a draught of English milk, that is to say,
</p>
<p>a dram of whiskey.

<p>Marie, when a canoe, filled with warriors, arrived,
</p>
<p>bringing the message of Sir William Johnson. A
</p>
<p>council was called ; and the principal messenger,
</p>
<p>offering a belt of wampum, spoke as follows : " My
</p>
<p>friends and brothers, I am come with this belt from
</p>
<p>our great father. Sir William Johnson. He desired
</p>
<p>me to come to you, as his ambassador, and tell you
</p>
<p>that he is making a great feast at Fort Niagara ;
</p>
<p>tLa'c his kettles are all ready, and his fires lighted.
</p>
<p>He invites you to partake of the feast, in common
</p>
<p>with your friends, the Six Nations, who have all
</p>
<p>made peace with the English. He advises you to
</p>
<p>seize this opportunity of doing the same, as you
</p>
<p>cannot otherwise fail of being destroyed ; for the
</p>
<p>English 'are on their march with a great army,
</p>
<p>which will be joined by different nations of Indi
</p>
<p>ans. In a word, before the fall of the leaf they
</p>
<p>will be at Michillimackinac, and the Six Nations
</p>
<p>with them."
</p>
<p>The Ojibwas had been debating whether they
</p>
<p>should go to Detroit, to the assistance of Pontiac,
</p>
<p>who had just sent them a message to that effect ;
</p>
<p>but the speech of Johnson's messenger turned the
</p>
<p>current of their thoughts. Most of them were in
</p>
<p>favor of accepting the invitation ; but, distrusting
</p>
<p>mere human wisdom in a crisis so important, they
</p>
<p>resolved, before taking a decisive step, to invoke
</p>
<p>the superior intelligence of the Great Turtle, the
</p>
<p>chief of all the spirits. A huge wigwam waa
</p>
<p>erected, capable of containing the whole popula-
</p>
<p>tion of the little village. In the centre, a sort of

<p>tabernacle was constructed by driving posts into
</p>
<p>166 BRADSTREET'S ARMY ON THE LAKES [1704
</p>
<p>the ground, and closely covering them with hides/
</p>
<p>With the arrival of night, the propitious time for
</p>
<p>consulting their oracle, all the warriors assembled
</p>
<p>in the spacious wigwam, half lighted by the lurid
</p>
<p>glare of fires, and waited, in suspense and awe, the
</p>
<p>issue of the invocation. The medicine man, oi
</p>
<p>magician, stripped almost naked, now entered the
</p>
<p>central tabernacle, which was barely large enough
</p>
<p>to receive him, and carefully closed the aperture.
</p>
<p>At once the whole structure began to shake with a
</p>
<p>violence which threatened its demolition ; and a
</p>
<p>confusion of horrible sounds, shrieks, howls, yells,
</p>
<p>and moans of anguish, mingled with articulate
</p>
<p>words, sounded in hideous discord from within.
</p>
<p>This outrageous clamor, which announced to the
</p>
<p>horror-stricken spectators the presence of a host
</p>
<p>of evil spirits, ceased as suddenly as it had begun.
</p>
<p>A low, feeble sound, like the whine of a young
</p>
<p>puppy, was next heard within the recess ; upon
</p>
<p>which the warriors raised a cry of joy, and hailed
</p>
<p>it as the voice of the Great Turtle  the spirit
</p>
<p>who never lied. The magician soon announced
</p>
<p>that the spirit was ready to answer any question
</p>
<p>which might be proposed. On this, the chief
</p>
<p>warrior stepped forward ; and, having propitiated
</p>
<p>the Great Turtle by a present of tobacco thrust
</p>
<p>through a small hole in the tabernacle, inquired if
</p>
<p>the English were in reality preparing to attack the
</p>
<p>Indians, and if the troops were already come to
</p>
<p>Niagara. Once more the tabernacle was violently
</p>
<p>shaken, a loud yell w^as heard, and it was apparent

<p>to all that the spirit was gone. A pause of anxious
</p>
<p>1764. INDIAN ORACLE. 1G7
</p>
<p>expectation ensued ; when, after the lapse of a
</p>
<p>quarter of an hour, the weak, puppy-like voice of
</p>
<p>the Great Turtle was again heard addressing the
</p>
<p>magician in a language unknown to the auditors.
</p>
<p>When (he spirit ceased speaking, the magician
</p>
<p>interpreted his words. During the short interval
</p>
<p>of his departure, he had crossed Lake Huron,
</p>
<p>visited Niagara, and descended the St. Lawrence to
</p>
<p>Montreal. Few soldiers had as yet reached Niag-
</p>
<p>ara ; but as he flew down the St. Lawrence, he had
</p>
<p>seen the water covered with boats, all filled with
</p>
<p>English warriors, coming to make war on the Indi-
</p>
<p>ans. Having obtained this answer to his first
</p>
<p>question, the chief ventured to propose another;
</p>
<p>and inquired if he and his people, should they
</p>
<p>accept the invitation of Sir William Johnson,
</p>
<p>would be well received at Niagara. The answer
</p>
<p>was most satisfactory. " Sir William Johnson,''
</p>
<p>said the spirit, " will fill your canoes with presents ;
</p>
<p>with blankets, kettles, guns, gunpowder and shot ;
</p>
<p>and large barrels of rum, such as the stoutest
</p>
<p>of the Indians will not be able to lift ; and every
</p>
<p>man will return in safety to his family." This
</p>
<p>grateful response produced a general outburst of
</p>
<p>acclamations ; and, with cries of joy, many voices
</p>
<p>were heard to exclaim, '' I will go too ! I will ^o
</p>
<p>too ! "

<p>The metliod of invoking the spirits, described above, is a favorite specie*

<p>They set out, accordingly, for Niagara ; and
</p>
<p>thither also numerous bands of warriors were tend
</p>
<p>ing, urged by similar messages, and encouraged, it
</p>
<p>may be, by similar responses of their oracles.
</p>
<p>Crossing fresh- water oceans in their birch canoes,
</p>
<p>and threading the devious windings of solitary
</p>
<p>streams, they came flocking to the common centre
</p>
<p>of attraction. Such a concourse of savages has
</p>
<p>seldom been seen in America. Menomonies, Otta-
</p>
<p>was, Ojibwas, Mississaugas, from the north ; Caugh 
</p>
<p>nawagas from Canada, even Wyandots from Detroit,
</p>
<p>together with a host of Iroquois, were congregated
</p>
<p>round Fort Niagara to the number of more than
</p>
<p>two thousand warriors ; many of whom had
</p>
<p>brought with them their women and children.*
</p>
<p>liaving invoked a spirit in tliis manner, treacherously killed him with a
</p>
<p>hatchet ; the mysterious visitant having assumed a visible and tangible
</p>
<p>form, which exposed him to the incidents of mortality. During thesa
</p>
<p>invocations, the lodge or tabernacle was always observed to shake vio-
</p>
<p>lently to and fro, in a manner so remarkable as exceedingly to perplex
</p>
<p>the observers. The variety of discordant sounds, uttered by tiie medicine
</p>
<p>man, need not surprise us more than those accurate imitations of the
</p>
<p>cries of various mimals, to which Indian hunters are accustomed to train
</p>
<p>their strong and flexible voices.

<p>The following extract from Henry's Travels will exhibit the feelings
</p>
<p>with whicli the Indians came to the conference at Niagara, besides illus-
</p>
<p>trating a curious tieature of their superstitions. Many tribes, including
</p>
<p>some widely differing in language and habits, regard the rattlesnake with
</p>
<p>superstitious veneration ; looking upon him either as a manitou, or spirit,
</p>
<p>or as a creature endowed with mystic powers and attributes, giving }:im
</p>
<p>an influence over the fortunes of mankind. Henry accompanied his
</p>
<p>Indian companions to Niagara ; and, on the way, he chanced to discover
</p>
<p>Due of these snakes near their encampment :

<p>"The reptile was coiled, and its head raised considerably al::)ve its
</p>
<p>body. Had I advanced another step before my discovery, 1 must have
</p>
<p>trodden upon it.
</p>
<p>" I no sooner saw the snake, than I hastened to the canoe, in order id
</p>
<p>procure raj gun; but the Indians, observing what J was doing, iQqulre<1

</p>
<p>Even the Sacs, the Foxes, and the Winnebagoes
</p>
<p>had sent theu' deputies ; and the Osages, a tribe
</p>
<p>the occasion, and, being informed, begged me to desist. At the same
</p>
<p>time, they followed me to the spot, with their pipes and tobacco-pouches
</p>
<p>in their hands. On returning, I found tlie snake still coiled.
</p>
<p>" The Indians, on their part, surrounded it, all addressing it by turns,
</p>
<p>and calling it their (frandfaiher, but yet keeping at some distance. During
</p>
<p>this part of the ceremony, they filled their pipes ; and now each blew the
</p>
<p>Bmoke toward the snake, who, as it appeared to me, really received it
</p>
<p>with pleasure. In a word, after remaining coiled, and receiving incense,
</p>
<p>for the space of half an hour, it stretched itself along the ground, in visible
</p>
<p>good humor. Its length was between four and five feet. Having remained
</p>
<p>outstretched for some time, at last it moved slowly away, the Indians fol-
</p>
<p>lowing it, and still addressing it by the title of grandfather, beseeching it
</p>
<p>to take care of their families during their absence, and to be pleased to
</p>
<p>open the heart of Sir William Johnson, so that he might show them charity,
</p>
<p>and fill their canoe with rum.
</p>
<p>" One of the chiefs added a petition, that the snake would take no
</p>
<p>notice of the insult which had been offered him by the Englishman, who
</p>
<p>would even have put him to death, but for the interference of the Indians
</p>
<p>to whom it was hoped he would impute no part of the offence. They fur-
</p>
<p>ther requested, that he would remain, and not return among the English
</p>
<p>that is, go eastward.
</p>
<p>'' After tlie rattlesnake was gone, I learned that this was the first time
</p>
<p>that an individual of the species had been seen so far to the northward
</p>
<p>and westward of the River Des Fran^ais; a circumstance, moreover, from
</p>
<p>which my companions were disposed to infer, that this manito had come,
</p>
<p>or been sent, on purpose to meet them ; that his errand had been no
</p>
<p>other than to stop them on their way ; and that consequently it would be
</p>
<p>most advisable to return to the point of departure. I was so fortunate,
</p>
<p>however, as to prevail with them to embark ; and at six o'clock in the
</p>
<p>evening we again encamped.
</p>
<p>'Early the next morning we proceeded. We had a serene sky and
</p>
<p>very little wind, and the Indians therefore determined on steering across

<p>the lake, to an island (vhich just appeared in the horizon; saving, by this
</p>
<p>course, a distance of thirty miles, which would be lost in keeping the
</p>
<p>shore. At nine o'clock a.m. we had a light breeze, to enjoy the benefit
</p>
<p>of which we hoisted sail. Soon after, the wind increased, and the Indians,
</p>
<p>beginning to be alarmed, frequently called on the rattlesnake to come to
</p>
<p>their assistance. By degrees the waves grew high ; and at eleven o'clock
</p>
<p>it biew a hurricane, and we expected every moment to be swallowed

<p>lip. From prayers, the Indians proceeded now to sacrifices, both alike
</p>
<p>ofiered to the god-rattlesnake, or manito-kimbic. One of the chiefs took a
</p>
<p>dog, and after tying its fore legs together, threw it overboard, at the
</p>
<p>same time calling on the snake to preserve us from being drowed, and

<p>beyond the Mississippi, had their representative in
</p>
<p>this general meeting.
</p>
<p>Thongh the assembled multitude consisted, for
</p>
<p>the most part, of the more pacilic members of the
</p>
<p>tribes represented, yet their friendly disposition
</p>
<p>vras by no means certain. Several straggling
</p>
<p>soldiers were shot at in the neighborhood, and it
</p>
<p>soon became apparent that the utmost precaution
</p>
<p>musl be taken to avert a rupture. The troops were
</p>
<p>kept always on their guard ; while the black muz-
</p>
<p>zles of the cannon, thrust from the bastions of the
</p>
<p>fort, struck a wholesome awe into the savage
</p>
<p>throng below.
</p>
<p>Although so many had attended the meeting,
</p>
<p>there were still numerous tribes, and portions of
</p>
<p>tribes, who maintained a rancorous, unwavering
</p>
<p>hostility. The Dela wares and Shawanoes, how-
</p>
<p>ever, against whom Bouquet, with the army of the
</p>
<p>south, was then in the act of advancing, sent a
</p>
<p>message to the effect, that, though they had no fear
</p>
<p>of the English, and though they regarded them ass

<p>old women, and held them in contempt, yet, out of

</p>
<p>BHake was unpropitious, and the wind increased. Anotlier chief sacrificed
</p>
<p>another dog, with the addition of some tol)acco. In the prayer whicli
</p>
<p>Icccmpanied these gifts, lie besought tlie snake, as before, not to avenge
</p>
<p>upon the Indians the insult which he had received from myself, in the
</p>
<p>conception of a design to put him to death. He assured the snake that 1

<p>observed, that if we were drowned it would be for my fault alone, and

<p>that I ought myself to be sacrificed, to appease the angry manito ; nor

<p>pity for their sufferings, they were willing to treat
</p>
<p>of peace. To this insolent missive Johnson made
</p>
<p>no answer ; and, indeed, those who sent it were, at
</p>
<p>this very time, renewing the bloody work of the
</p>
<p>preceding year along the borders of Pennsylvcinia
</p>
<p>and Virginia. The Senecas, that numerous and
</p>
<p>warlike people, to whose savage enmity were to be
</p>
<p>ascribed the massacre at the Devil's Hole, and
</p>
<p>other disasters of the last summer, had recently
</p>
<p>made a preliminary treaty with Sir William John-
</p>
<p>son, and at the same time pledged themselves to
</p>
<p>appear at Niagara to ratify and complete it. They
</p>
<p>broke their promise ; and it soon became known
</p>
<p>that they had leagued themselves with a large ba-nd
</p>
<p>of hostile Delawares, who had visited their countr)
</p>
<p>Upon this, a messenger was sent to them, threaten
</p>
<p>iug tliat, unless they instantly came to Niagara, the
</p>
<p>English would march upon them and burn their
</p>
<p>villages. The menace had full effect; and a large
</p>
<p>body of these formidable warriors appeared at the
</p>
<p>English camp, bringing fourteen prisoners, besides
</p>
<p>several deserters and runaway slaves. A peace
</p>
<p>was concluded, on condition that they should never
</p>
<p>again attack the English, and that they should cede
</p>
<p>to the British crown a strip of land, between the
</p>
<p>Lakes Erie and Ontario, four miles in width, on
</p>
<p>both sides of the Eiver, or Strait, of Niagara.^ A

</p>
<p>Councils were next held, in turn, with each of
</p>
<p>the various tribes assembled around the fort, some
</p>
<p>of whom craved forgiveness for the hostile acts
</p>
<p>they had committed, and deprecated the vengeance
</p>
<p>of the English ; while others alleged their inno-
</p>
<p>cence, urged their extreme wants and necessities,
</p>
<p>and begged that. English traders might once more
</p>
<p>be allowed to visit them. The council-room in
</p>
<p>the fort was crowded from morning till night ; and
</p>
<p>the wearisome formalities of such occasions, the
</p>
<p>speeches made and replied to, and the final shak-
</p>
<p>ing of hands, smoking of pipes, and serving out
</p>
<p>of whiskey, engrossed the time of the superintend-
</p>
<p>ent for many successive days.
</p>
<p>Among the Indians present were a band of Otta-
</p>
<p>was from Michillimackinac, and remoter settle-
</p>
<p>ments, beyond Lake Michigan, and a band of
</p>
<p>Meno monies from Green Bay. The former, it will
</p>
<p>be remembered, had done good service to the Eng-
</p>
<p>lish ^ by rescuing the survivors of the garrison of
</p>
<p>Michillimackinac from the clutches of the Ojibwas ;
</p>
<p>and the latter had deserved no less at their hands,
</p>
<p>by the protection they had extended to Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Gorell, and the garrison at Green Bay. Conscious
</p>
<p>of their merits, they had come to Niagara in full
</p>
<p>confidence of a favorable reception. Nor were
</p>
<p>they disappointed ; for Jolmson met them with a
</p>
<p>cordial welcome, and greeted them as friends and

<p>brothers. They, on their part, were not wanting

<p>exclaimed, in the figurative language of his people,
</p>
<p>" When our brother came to meet us, the storms
</p>
<p>ceased, the lake became smooth, and the whole
</p>
<p>face of nature was changed."
</p>
<p>They disowned all connection or privity with the
</p>
<p>designs of Pontiac. " Brother," said one of the
</p>
<p>Ottawa chiefs, " you must not imagine 1 am
</p>
<p>acquainted with the cause of the war. I only
</p>
<p>heard a little bird whistle an account of it, and,
</p>
<p>on going to Michillimackinac, I found your people
</p>
<p>killed ; upon which I sent our priest to inquire
</p>
<p>hito the matter. On the priest's return, he brought
</p>
<p>me no favorable account, but a war-hatchet from
</p>
<p>Pontiac, which I scarcely looked on, and immedi-
</p>
<p>ately threw away."
</p>
<p>Another of the Ottawas, a chief of the remoter
</p>
<p>band of Lake Michigan, spoke to a similar effect,
</p>
<p>as follows : " We are not of the same people as
</p>
<p>those residing about Michillimackinac ; we only
</p>
<p>heard at a distance that the enemy were killing
</p>
<p>your soldiers, on which we covered our heads, and
</p>
<p>I resolved not to suffer my people to engage in the
</p>
<p>war. I gathered them together, and made them
</p>
<p>sit still. In the spring, on uncovering my head, I
</p>
<p>perceived that they had again begun a war, and
</p>
<p>that the sky was all cloudy in that quarter."
</p>
<p>The superintendent thanked them for their fidel-
</p>
<p>ity to the English ; reminded them that tlieir true
</p>
<p>interest lay in the preservation of peace, and con-

<p>ble at the fort. " And now, my brother," said a
</p>
<p>warrior, a? the council was about to break up, ' we
</p>
<p>beg that you will tell us where we can find some
</p>
<p>rum to comfort us ; for it is long since w^e have
</p>
<p>tasted any, and we are very thirsty." This honest
</p>
<p>request was not refused. The liquor was dis-
</p>
<p>tributed, and a more copious supply promised for
</p>
<p>the future ; upon which the deputation departed,
</p>
<p>and repaired to their encampment, much pleased
</p>
<p>with their reception.^
</p>
<p>Throughout these conferences, one point of pol-
</p>
<p>i<;y was constantly adhered to. No general council
</p>
<p>/''^was held. Separate treaties were made, in order
</p>
<p>to promote mutual jealousies and rivalries, and dis-
</p>
<p>courage the feeling of union, and of a common
</p>
<p>cause among the widely scattered tribes. Johnson
</p>
<p>at length completed his task, and, on the sixth of
</p>
<p>August, set sail for Oswego. The march of the
</p>
<p>army had hitherto been delayed by rumors of hos-
</p>
<p>tile designs on the part of the Indians, who, it was
</p>
<p>said, had formed a scheme for attacking Fort Niag-
</p>
<p>ara, as soon as the troops should have left the
</p>
<p>ground. Now, however, when the concourse was
</p>
<p>melting away, and the tribes departing for their
</p>
<p>distant homes, it was thought that the danger was
</p>
<p>past, and that the army might safely resume its
</p>
<p>progress. They advanced, accordingly, to Fort
</p>
<p>Schlosser, above the cataract, whither their boats
</p>
<p>and bateaux had been sent before them, craned up

<p>the rocks at Lewiston, and dragged by oxen over
</p>
<p>the rough portage road. The troops had been
</p>
<p>joined by three hundred friendly Indians, and an
</p>
<p>equal number of Canadians. The appearance of
</p>
<p>the latter in arms would, it was thought, have great
</p>
<p>effect on the minds of the enemy, who had always
</p>
<p>looked upon them as friends and supporters. Of
</p>
<p>the Indian allies, the greater part were Iroquois,
</p>
<p>and the remainder, about a hundred in number,
</p>
<p>Ojibwas and Mississaugas ; the former being the
</p>
<p>same who had recently arrived from the Sault Ste.
</p>
<p>Marie, bringing with them their prisoner, Alex-
</p>
<p>ander Henry. Henry was easily persuaded to
</p>
<p>accompany the expedition ; and the command of the
</p>
<p>Ojibwas and Mississaugas was assigned to him 
</p>
<p>" To me," writes the adventurous trader, " whose
</p>
<p>best hope it had lately been to live by their forbear-
</p>
<p>ance." His long-continued sufferings and dangers
</p>
<p>hardly deserved to be rewarded by so great a mis-
</p>
<p>fortune as that of commanding a body of Indian
</p>
<p>warriors ; an evil from which, however, he was
</p>
<p>soon to be relieved. The army had hardly begun
</p>
<p>its march, when nearly all his followers ran off,
</p>
<p>judging it wiser to return home with the arms and
</p>
<p>clothing given them for the expedition, than to make
</p>
<p>war -against their own countrymen and relatives.
</p>
<p>Fourteen warriors still remained ; but on the fol*
</p>
<p>lowing night, when the army lay at Fort Schlosser,
</p>
<p>having contrived by some means to obtain liquor,
</p>
<p>they created such a commotion in the camp, by

</p>
<p>from liim, in consequence, a reproof so harsh and ill
</p>
<p>judged, that most of them went home in disgust;
</p>
<p>and Henry found his Indian battalion suddenly
</p>
<p>dwindled to four or five vagabond hunters.^ A
</p>
<p>large number of Iroquois still followed the army,
</p>
<p>the strength of which, fcirther increased by a re-en-
</p>
<p>forcement of Highlanders, w^ns now very consid
</p>
<p>erable.
</p>
<p>^^ The troops left Fort Schlosser on the eighth.
</p>
<p>Their boats and bateaux pushed out into the Niag-
</p>
<p>ara, whose expanded waters reposed in a serenity
</p>
<p>soon to be exchanged for the wild roar and tumult-
</p>
<p>uous struggle of the rapids and the cataract. They
</p>
<p>coasted along the southern shore of Lake Erie
</p>
<p>until the twelfth, when, in the neighborhood of
</p>
<p>Presqu Isle, they were overtaken by a storm of rain,
</p>
<p>which forced them to drag their boats on shore,
</p>
<p>and pitch their tents in the dripping forest. Before
</p>
<p>the day closed, word w^as brought that strange
</p>
<p>Indians were near the camp. They soon made
</p>
<p>their appearance, proclaiming themselves to be
</p>
<p>chiefs and deputies of the Delawares and Shaw-
</p>
<p>anoes, empowered to beg for peace in the name of
</p>
<p>their respective tribes. Various opinions were
</p>
<p>entertained of the visitors. The Indian allies
</p>
<p>wished to kill them, and many of the officers be-
</p>
<p>lieved them to be spies. There was no proof of
</p>
<p>their pretended character of deputies ; and, for all
</p>
<p>that appeared to the contrary, they might be a
</p>
<p>mere straggling party of warriors. Their profes-

<p>dieted by the fact that they brought with them but
</p>
<p>one small belt of wampum ; a pledge no less indis-
</p>
<p>pensable in a treaty with these tribes than seals
</p>
<p>and signatures in a convention of European sover-
</p>
<p>eigns.^ Bradstreet knew, or ought to have known,
</p>
<p>the character of the treacherous enemy with whom
</p>
<p>he had to deal. He knew that the Shawanoes and
</p>
<p>Delawares had shown, throughout the war, a fero-
</p>
<p>cious and relentless hostility ; that they had sent an
</p>
<p>insolent message to Niagara ; and, finally, that in
</p>
<p>his own instructions he was enjoined to deal sternly
</p>
<p>with them, and not be duped by pretended over-
</p>
<p>tures. Yet, in spite of the suspicious character
</p>
<p>of the self-styled deputies, in spite of the sullen
</p>
<p>wrath of his Indian allies, and the murmured
</p>
<p>dissent of his officers, he listened to their proposals,
</p>
<p>and entered into a preliminary treaty. He pledged
</p>
<p>himself to refrain from attacking the Delawares
</p>
<p>and Shawanoes, on condition that within twenty-five
</p>
<p>days the deputies should again meet him at San-
</p>
<p>dusky, in order to yield up their prisoners, and
</p>
<p>conclude a definite treaty of peace.^ It afterwards

<p>appeared  and this, indeed, might have been
</p>
<p>suspected at the time  that the sole object of
</p>
<p>^ Every article in a treaty must be confirmed by a belt of wampum ;
</p>
<p>otherwise it is void. Mante, the historian of the French war, asserts that
</p>
<p>they brought four belts. But this is contradicted in contemporary letters,
</p>
<p>including several of General Gage and Sir William Johnson. Mante
</p>
<p>accompanied Bradstreet's expedition with the rank of major ; and he is a
</p>
<p>zealous advocate of his commander, whom he seeks to defend, at the
</p>
<p>expense both of Colonel Bouquet and General Gage.

<p>the overtures was to retard the action of the army
</p>
<p>until the season shoukl be too far advanced to
</p>
<p>prosecute the campaign. At this very moment,
</p>
<p>the Delaware and Shawanoe war-parties were
</p>
<p>murdering and scalping along the frontiers ; and
</p>
<p>the work of havoc continued for weeks, until it
</p>
<p>was checked at length by the operations of Colonel
</p>
<p>Bouquet.
</p>
<p>Bradstreet was not satisfied with the promise he
</p>
<p>had made to abandon his own hostile designs. IJe
</p>
<p>consummated his folly and presumption by des-
</p>
<p>patching a messenger to his superior officer, Colonel
</p>
<p>Bouquet, informing him that the Delawares and
</p>
<p>Shawanoes had been reduced to submission without
</p>
<p>his aid, and that he might withdraw his troops, as
</p>
<p>there was no need of his advancing farther. Bou-
</p>
<p>quet, astonished and indignant, paid no attention
</p>
<p>to this communication, but pursued his march as
</p>
<p>before.^
</p>
<p>The course pursued by Bradstreet in this affair 
</p>
<p>a course which can only be ascribed to the vain
</p>
<p>ambition of finishing the war without the aid of
</p>
<p>others  drew upon him the severe censures of the

<p>commander-in-chief, who, on hearing of the treaty,

<p>conclude a definite treaty with the Indians, a power

<p>which was vested in Sir William Johnson alone ;
</p>
<p>but as upon this point his instructions were not

<p>that which had been assigned to Colonel Bouquet,

<p>should make their submission. " To offer peace," writes Gage, "I think
</p>
<p>can never be construed a power to conclude and dictate the articles of peace,
</p>
<p>and you certainly know that no such power could with propriety be lodged

</p>
<p>that, if he would refrain from attacking them, they
</p>
<p>would follow him to Detroit, and there conclude a
</p>
<p>treaty. Bradstreet thought proper to trust this
</p>
<p>slippery promise ; though, with little loss of (imc
</p>
<p>he might have reduced them, on the spot, to a
</p>
<p>much more effectual submission. He now benl
</p>
<p>his course for Detroit, leaving the Indians of San-
</p>
<p>dusky much delighted, and probably no less sur-
</p>
<p>prised, at the success of their embassy. Before
</p>
<p>his departure, however, he despatched Captain
</p>
<p>Morris, with several Canadians and friendly Indi-
</p>
<p>ans, to the Illinois, in order to persuade the savages
</p>
<p>of that region to treat of peace with the English.
</p>
<p>The measure was in a high degree ill advised and
</p>
<p>rash, promising but doubtful advantage, and expos
</p>
<p>ing the life of a valuable officer to imminent risk.
</p>
<p>The sequel of Morris's adventure will soon appear.

<p>The English boats now entered the mouth of the

<p>The inhabitants of the Wyandot village on the

<p>right, who, it will be remembered, had recently
</p>
<p>made a treaty of peace at Niagara, ran down to
</p>
<p>the shore, shouting, whooping, and firing their
</p>
<p>guns,  a greeting more noisy than sincere, 
</p>
<p>while the cannon of the garrison echoed salutation
</p>
<p>from the opposite shore, and cheer on cheer, deep

<p>an Indian could be seen, yet woe to the soldier
</p>
<p>who should wander into the forest in search of
</p>
<p>game, or stroll too fiir beyond range of the cannon.
</p>
<p>Throughout the preceding winter, they had been
</p>
<p>left in comparative quiet ; but with the opening
</p>
<p>spring the Indians liad resumed their pertinacious
</p>
<p>hostilities ; not, however, with the same activity
</p>
<p>and vigor as during the preceding summer. The
</p>
<p>messages of Sir William Johnson, and the tidings
</p>
<p>of Bradstreet's intended expedition, had had great
</p>
<p>eifect upon their minds, and some of them had
</p>
<p>begged abjectly for peace ; but still the garrison
</p>
<p>were harassed by frequent alarms, and days and
</p>
<p>nights of watchfulness w^ere their unvarying lot.
</p>
<p>Cut off for months together from all communica-

<p>onment; ill supplied with provisions, and with

<p>clothing worn threadbare, they hailed with delight

<p>the prospect of a return to the world from which

<p>they had been banished so long. The army had
</p>
<p>no sooner landed than the garrison was relieved,

<p>of the Canadian inhabitants of Detroit, and punish

</p>
<p>had retired, as we have seen, to the banks of the
</p>
<p>Maumee, whence he sent a haughty defiance to the
</p>
<p>Enghsh commander. Tlie Indian villages near
</p>
<p>Detroit were half emptied of their inhabitants,
</p>
<p>many of whom still followed the desperate for
</p>
<p>tunes of their indomitable leader. Those who
</p>
<p>remained were, for the most part, brought by
</p>
<p>famine and misery to a sincere desire for peace,
</p>
<p>and readily obeyed the summons of Bradstreet to
</p>
<p>meet him in council.
</p>
<p>The council was held in the open air, on the
</p>
<p>morning of the seventh of September, with all the
</p>
<p>accompaniments of military display which could
</p>
<p>inspire awe and respect among the assembled
</p>
<p>savages. The tribes, or rather fragments of tribes,
</p>
<p>represented at this meeting, were the Ottawas,
</p>
<p>Ojibwas, Pottawattamies, Miamis, Sacs, and Wyan-
</p>
<p>dots. The Indians of Sandusky kept imperfectly
</p>
<p>the promise they had made, the Wyandots of that
</p>
<p>place alone sending a full deputation ; while
</p>
<p>the other tribes were merely represented by the
</p>
<p>Ojibwa chief Wasson. This man, who was the
</p>
<p>principal chief of his tribe, and the most promi-
</p>
<p>nent orator on the present occasion, rose and
</p>
<p>opened the council.
</p>
<p>" My brother," he said, addressing Bradstreet,

<p>had such fine weather to come to us. It is God's

</p>
<p>Having delivered this exordium, Wasson frankly
</p>
<p>confessed that the tribes which he represented were
</p>
<p>al] justly chargeable with the war, and now deeply
</p>
<p>regretted their delinquency. It is common with
</p>
<p>Indians, when accused of acts of violence, to lay
</p>
<p>the blame upon the unbridled recklessness of their
</p>
<p>young warriors ; and this excuse is often perfectly
</p>
<p>sound and valid ; but since, in the case of a pre-
</p>
<p>meditated and long-continued war, it was glaringly
</p>
<p>inadmissible, they now reversed the usual course,
</p>
<p>and made scapegoats of the old chiefs and warriors,
</p>
<p>who, as they declared, had led the people astray
</p>
<p>by sinister counsel and bad example.^
</p>
<p>Bradstreet would grant peace only on condition
</p>
<p>that they should become subjects of the King of
</p>
<p>England, and acknowdedge that he held over their
</p>
<p>country a sovereignty as ample and complete as
</p>
<p>over any other part of his dominions. Nothing
</p>
<p>could be more impolitic and absurd than this
</p>
<p>demand. The smallest attempt at an invasion
</p>
<p>of their liberties has always been regarded by the
</p>
<p>Indians with extreme jealousy, and a prominent
</p>
<p>cause of the war had been an undue assumption
</p>
<p>of authority on the part of the English. This
</p>
<p>article of the treaty, could its purport have been
</p>
<p>fully understood, might have kindled afresh the
</p>
<p>quarrel which it sought to extinguish ; but happily
</p>
<p>not a savage present was able to comprehend it.
</p>
<p>Subjection and sovereignty are ideas which never

<p>his language has no words to express them. Most
</p>
<p>of the western tribes, it is true, had been accus'
</p>
<p>tomed to call themselves children of the King of
</p>
<p>France ; but the words were a mere compliment,
</p>
<p>conveying no sense of any political relation what-
</p>
<p>ever. Yet it was solely by means of this harmless
</p>
<p>metaphor that the condition in question could be
</p>
<p>explained to the assembled chiefs. Thus inter-
</p>
<p>preted, it met with a ready assent ; since, in their
</p>
<p>eyes, it involved no concession beyond a mere
</p>
<p>unmeaning change of forms and words. They
</p>
<p>promised, in future, to call the English king
</p>
<p>father, instead of brother ; unconscious of any obli-
</p>
<p>gation which so trifling a change could impose, and
</p>
<p>mentally reserving a full right to make war on
</p>
<p>him or his people, whenever it should suit their
</p>
<p>convenience. When Bradstreet returned from his
</p>
<p>expedition, he boasted that he had reduced the
</p>
<p>tribes of Detroit to terms of more complete submis-
</p>
<p>sion than any other Indians had ever before yielded;
</p>
<p>but the truth was soon detected and exposed by
</p>
<p>those conversant with Indian affairs.^
</p>
<p>At this council, Bradstreet was guilty of the baa
</p>
<p>policy and bad taste of speaking through the
</p>
<p>medium of a French interpreter ; so that most of
</p>
<p>his own officers, as well as the Iroquois allies, who
</p>
<p>v^ere strangers to the Algonquin language, remained
</p>
<p>in ignorance of all that passed. The latter were
</p>
<p>highly indignant, and refused to become parties to
</p>
<p>the treaty, or go through the usual ceremony of
</p>
<p>shaking hands with the chiefs of Detroit, insisting

<p>that they had not heard their speeches, and knew
</p>
<p>not whether they were friends or enemies. In
</p>
<p>another particular, also, Bradstreet gave great
</p>
<p>offence. From some unexplained impulse or mo-
</p>
<p>tive, he cut to pieces, with a hatchet, a belt of
</p>
<p>wampum which was about to be used in the coun-
</p>
<p>cil ; and all the Indians present, both friends and
</p>
<p>enemies, were alike incensed at this rude violation
</p>
<p>of the ancient pledge of faith, which, in their eyes,
</p>
<p>was invested with something of a sacred character.*
</p>
<p>Having settled the affairs of Detroit, Bradstreet
</p>
<p>dispatched Captain Howard, with a strong detach-
</p>
<p>ment, to take possession of Michillimackinac, which
</p>
<p>had remained unoccupied since its capture in the
</p>
<p>preceding summer. Howard effected his object
</p>
<p>without resistance, and, at the same time, sent par
</p>
<p>ties of troops to reoccupy the deserted posts of
</p>
<p>Green Bay and Sault Ste. Marie. Thus, after the
</p>
<p>interval of more than a year, the flag of England
</p>
<p>was again displayed among the solitudes of the
</p>
<p>northern wilderness.^
</p>
<p>While Bradstreet's army lay encamped on the
</p>
<p>fields near Detroit, Captain ]M orris, with a few
</p>
<p>Iroquois and Canadian attendants, was pursuing
</p>
<p>his adventurous embassy to the country of the

<p>did not indicate any especial degree of enterprise
</p>
<p>or resolution. He seems, however, to have had
</p>
<p>both; for, on a hint from the General, he had
</p>
<p>offered himself for the adventure, for which he was
</p>
<p>better fitted than most of his brother officers, inas-
</p>
<p>much as he spoke French. He was dining, on the
</p>
<p>eve of his departure, in the tent of Bradstreet, when
</p>
<p>his host suddenly remarked, in the bluff way habit-
</p>
<p>ual to him, tliat he had a French fellow, a prisoner,
</p>
<p>whom he meant to hang ; but that, if Morris would
</p>
<p>like him for an interpreter, he might have him.
</p>
<p>The prisoner in question was the Canadian Gode-
</p>
<p>froy, who was presently led into the tent ; and who,
</p>
<p>conscious of many misdemeanors, thought that his
</p>
<p>hour was come, and fell on his knees to beg his
</p>
<p>life. Bradstreet told him that he should be par-
</p>
<p>doned if he would promise to "go with this
</p>
<p>gentleman, and take good care of him," pointing to
</p>
<p>his guest. Godefroy promised ; and, to the best of
</p>
<p>his power, he kept his word, for he imagined that
</p>
<p>Morris had saved his life.
</p>
<p>Morris set out on the following afternoon with
</p>
<p>Godefroy, another Canadian, two servants, and a
</p>
<p>party of Indians, ascended the Maumee, and soon
</p>
<p>approached the camp of Pontiac ; who, as already
</p>
<p>mentioned, had withdrawn to this river with his
</p>
<p>chosen warriors. The party disembarked from
</p>
<p>their canoes ; and an Ottawa chief, who had joined
</p>
<p>them, lent them three horses. Morris and the
</p>
<p>Canadians mounted, and, preceded by their Indian
</p>
<p>attendants, displaying an English flag, advanced in

<p>state towards the camp, which was two leaguej^ or

</p>
<p>more distant. As they drew near, they were met
</p>
<p>by a rabble of several hundred Indians, called by
</p>
<p>Morris " Pontiac's army." They surrounded him,
</p>
<p>beat his horse, and crowded between him and his fol-
</p>
<p>lowers, apparently trying to separate them. At the
</p>
<p>outskirts of the camp stood Pontiac himself, who
</p>
<p>met the ambassador with a scowling brow, and
</p>
<p>refused to offer his hand. Here, too, stood a man,
</p>
<p>in the uniform of a French officer, holding his gun
</p>
<p>with the butt resting on the ground, and assuming
</p>
<p>an au- of great importance ; while two Pawnee
</p>
<p>slaves stood close behind him. He proved to be a
</p>
<p>French drummer, calling himself St. Vincent, one
</p>
<p>of those renegades of civilization to be found in
</p>
<p>almost every Indian camp. He now took upon
</p>
<p>himself the office of a master of ceremonies ;
</p>
<p>desired Morris to dismount, and seated himself at
</p>
<p>his side on a bearskin. Godefroy took his place
</p>
<p>near them ; and the throng of savages, circle
</p>
<p>within circle, stood crowded around. " Pres-
</p>
<p>ently,' says Morris, " came Pontiac, and squatted
</p>
<p>himself, after his fashion, opposite to me." He
</p>
<p>opened the interview by observing that the English
</p>
<p>were liars, and demanding of the ambassador if he
</p>
<p>had come to lie to them, like the rest. " This
</p>
<p>Indian," pursues Morris, " has a more extensive
</p>
<p>power than ever was known among that people,
</p>
<p>for every chief used to command his own tribe ;
</p>
<p>but eighteen nations, by French intrigue, had been
</p>
<p>brought to unite and choose this man for their
</p>
<p>commander."

</p>
<p>self, and sent from New Orleans, though purporting
</p>
<p>to be written by the King of France. It contained,
</p>
<p>according to Morris, the grossest cahimnies that
</p>
<p>the most ingenious maUce could devise to incense
</p>
<p>the Indians against the English. The old false-
</p>
<p>hood was not forgotten : '' Your French Father,"
</p>
<p>said the writer, '* is neither dead nor asleep ; he is
</p>
<p>already on his way, with sixty great ships, to
</p>
<p>revenge himself on the English, and drive them
</p>
<p>out of America." Much excitement followed the
</p>
<p>readino^ of the letter, and Morris's situation became
</p>
<p>more than unpleasant ; but St. Vincent befriended
</p>
<p>liim, and hurried him off to his wigwam to keep
</p>
<p>him out of harm's way.
</p>
<p>On the next day there was a grand council.
</p>
<p>Morris made a speech, in which he indiscreetly told
</p>
<p>the Indians that the King of France had given all
</p>
<p>the country to the King of England. Luckily, his
</p>
<p>auditors received the announcement with ridicule
</p>
<p>rather than anger. The chiefs, however, wished
</p>
<p>to kill him ; but Pontiac interposed, on the ground
</p>
<p>that the life of an ambassador should be held
</p>
<p>sacred. " He made a speech," says Morris, " which
</p>
<p>does him honor, and shows tliat he was acquainted
</p>
<p>with the law of nations." lie seemed in a mood
</p>
<p>Ziiore pacific than could have been expected, and
</p>
<p>said privately to Godefroy : " I will lead the nations

<p>I have an arrow left." Morris thinks that he said
</p>
<p>1764, Sept.] EMBASSY OF MORRIS. 1<S5
</p>
<p>this in a fit of despair, and that, in fact, he was
</p>
<p>willing to come to terms.
</p>
<p>The day following was an unlucky one. One
</p>
<p>of Morris's Indians, a Mohawk chief, ran off, hav-
</p>
<p>ing first stolen all he could lay hands on, and soUl
</p>
<p>the ambassador's stock of rum, consisting of two
</p>
<p>barrels, to the Ottawas. A scene of frenzy ensued
</p>
<p>A young Indian ran up to Morris, and stabbed at
</p>
<p>him savagely ; but Godefroy caught the assassin's
</p>
<p>hand, and saved his patron's life. Morris escaped
</p>
<p>from the camp, and lay hidden in a corn-field till
</p>
<p>the howling and screeching subsided, and the In
</p>
<p>dians slept themselves sober. When he returned,
</p>
<p>an Indian, called the Little Chief, gave him a vol
</p>
<p>ume of Shakespeare,  the spoil of some slaugh
</p>
<p>tered officer,  and then begged for gunpowder.
</p>
<p>Having first gained Pontiac's consent, Morriu
</p>
<p>now resumed his journey to the Illinois. The river
</p>

<p>handsome white horse, said to have belonged to

<p>without a garrison ; and its only tenants were the

</p>
<p>about the fort were dotted with the lodges of tlie
</p>
<p>Kickapoos, a large band of whom had recently
</p>
<p>arrived ; but the great Miami village was on the
</p>
<p>opposite side of the stream, screened from sight
</p>
<p>by the forest which intervened.
</p>
<p>The party landed a little below the fort; and,
</p>
<p>while his followers were making their way through
</p>
<p>the border of woods that skirted the river, Morris
</p>
<p>remained in the canoe, solacing himself by reading
</p>
<p>Antony and Cleopatra in the volume he had so
</p>
<p>oddly obtained. It was fortunate that he did so ;
</p>
<p>for his attendants had scarcely reached the open
</p>
<p>meadow, which lay behind the woods, when they
</p>
<p>were encountered by a mob of savages, armed
</p>
<p>with spears, hatchets, and bows and arrows, and
</p>
<p>bent on killing the Englishman. Being, for the
</p>
<p>moment, unable to find him, the chiefs had time to
</p>
<p>address the excited rabble, and persuade them to
</p>
<p>postpone their intended vengeance. The ambassa-
</p>
<p>dor, buffeted, threatened, and insulted, was con-
</p>
<p>ducted to the fort, where he was ordered to
</p>
<p>remain ; though, at the same time, the Canadian
</p>
<p>inhabitants were forbidden to admit him into their
</p>
<p>houses. Morris soon discovered that this unex-
</p>
<p>pected rough treatment was owing to the influence
</p>
<p>of a deputation of Delaware and Shawanoe chiefs,
</p>
<p>who had recently arrived, bringing fourteen war
</p>
<p>belts of wampum, and exciting the Miamis to
</p>
<p>renew their hostilities against the common enemy.
</p>
<p>Thiis it was fully apparent that while the Delawares
</p>
<p>and Shawanoes were sending one deputation to

</p>
<p>1764, Sept.] EMBASSY OF MORRIS. 191
</p>
<p>were sending another to rouse the tribes of the
</p>
<p>Illinois to war.^ From Fort Miami, the deputa-
</p>
<p>tion had proceeded westward, spreading the conta
</p>
<p>gion among all the tribes between the Mississippi
</p>
<p>and the Ohio ; declaring that they w^ould never
</p>
<p>make peace with the English, but would fight them
</p>
<p>as long as the sun should shine, and calling on
</p>
<p>their brethren of the Illinois to follow thoir
</p>
<p>example.
</p>
<p>They had been aware of the approach of Morris,
</p>
<p>and had urged the Miamis to put him to death
</p>
<p>when he arrived. Accordingly, he had not been
</p>
<p>long at the fort when two warriors, with tomahawks
</p>
<p>in their hands, entered, seized him by the arms,
</p>
<p>and dragged him towards the river. Godefroy
</p>
<p>stood by, pale and motionless. " Eh Men, vous
</p>
<p>m'ohandonnez done!'' said Morris. '' JVon, mon
</p>
<p>capitaine^' the Canadian answered, "je ne vous
</p>
<p>ah andonnerai jamais ;" and he followed, as the two
</p>
<p>savages dragged their captive into the water. Mor-
</p>
<p>ris thought that they meant to drown and scalp
</p>
<p>him, but soon saw his mistake ; for they led him
</p>
<p>through the stream, which was fordable, and thence
</p>
<p>towards the Miami village. As they drew near,
</p>
<p>they stopped, and began to strip him, but grew
</p>
<p>angry at the difficulty of the task ; till, in rage and
</p>
<p>despair, he tore off his clothes himself. They then
</p>
<p>bound his arms behind him with his own sash,
</p>
<p>1 " About the end of next month," said the deputies to the Miamis,
</p>
<p>"we shall send you the war-hatchet." "Doubtless," remarks Morris,
</p>
<p>" their design was to amuse General Bradstreet with fair language, to cut
</p>
<p>off his army at Sandusky when least expected, and then to send the

</p>
<p>and drove him before tliem to the village, where
</p>
<p>they made hiir. sit on a bench. A whooping,
</p>
<p>screeching mob of savages was instantly about him,
</p>
<p>and a hundred voices clamored together in dispute
</p>
<p>as to what should be done with him. Godefroy
</p>
<p>stood by him with a courageous fidelity that re
</p>
<p>deemed his past rascalities. He urged a nephew
</p>
<p>of Pontiac, who was present, to speak for the
</p>
<p>prisoner. The young Indian made a bold harangue
</p>
<p>to the crowd ; and Godefroy added that, if Morris
</p>
<p>were killed, the English would take revenge on
</p>
<p>those who were in their power at Detroit. A
</p>
<p>Miami chief, called the Swan, now declared for
</p>
<p>the Englishman, untied his arms, and gave him a
</p>
<p>pipe to smoke ; whereupon another chief, called
</p>
<p>che White Cat, snatched it from him, seized him,
</p>
<p>and bound him fast by the neck to a post. Naked,
</p>
<p>lielpless, and despairing, he saw the crowd gather-
</p>
<p>ing around to torture him. "I had not the small-
</p>
<p>est hope of life," he says, " and I remember that I
</p>
<p>conceived myself as if going to plunge into a gulf,
</p>
<p>vast, immeasurable ; and that, a few moments after,
</p>
<p>the thought of torture occasioned a sort of torpor
</p>
<p>and insensibility. I looked at Godefroy, and, seeing
</p>
<p>him exceedingly distressed, I said what I could to
</p>
<p>encourage him ; but he desired me not to speak.
</p>
<p>I supposed it gave offence to the savages, and there-
</p>
<p>fore was silent ; when Pacanne, chief of the Miami
</p>
<p>nation, and just out of his minority, having mounted
</p>
<p>a horse and crossed the river, rode up to me.

</p>
<p>going to strangle me, out of pity ; but he untied
</p>

</p>
<p>' I give that man his life. If you want English
</p>
<p>meat, go to Detroit, or to the hike, and you'll find
</p>
<p>enough. What business have you with this man's
</p>
<p>llesh, who is come to speak with us ? ' I fixed my
</p>
<p>.^yes steadfastly on this young man, and endeavored
</p>
<p>by looks to express my gratitude."
</p>
<p>An Indian now offered him a pipe, and he
</p>
<p>was then pushed with abuse and blows out of the
</p>
<p>village. He succeeded in crossing the river and
</p>
<p>regaining the fort, after receiving a sharp cut of
</p>
<p>a switch from a mounted Indian whom he met
</p>
<p>on the way.
</p>
<p>He found the Canadians in the fort disposed to
</p>
<p>befriend him. Godefroy and the metamori)hosed
</p>
<p>drummer, St. Vincent, were always on tl^e watch
</p>
<p>to warn him of danger ; and one TEsperance gave
</p>
<p>him an asylum in his garret. He seems to have
</p>
<p>found some consolation in the compassion of two
</p>
<p>handsome young squaws, sisters, he was told, of his
</p>
<p>deliverer, Pacanne ; but the two warriors who had
</p>
<p>stripped and bound him were constantly lurking
</p>
<p>about the fort, watching an opportunity to kill him ;
</p>
<p>and the Kickapoos, whose lodges were pitched on
</p>
<p>the meadow, sent him a message to the effect that,
</p>
<p>if the Miamis did not put him to death, they them
</p>
<p>selves would do so, whenever he should pass their
</p>
<p>camp. He was still on the threshold of his jour-
</p>
<p>ney, and his final point of destination was several
</p>
<p>hundred miles distant ; yet, with great resolution,

<p>he determined to persevere, and, if possible, fulfil

<p>194: BRADSTREET'S aKMY ON THE LAKES. [1764, Seft
</p>
<p>his mission. His Indian and Canadian attendants
</p>
<p>used every means to dissuade him, and in the even
</p>
<p>ing held a council with the Miami chiefs, the result
</p>
<p>of which was most discouraging. Morris received
</p>
<p>message after message, threatening his life, shouhi
</p>
<p>he persist in his design ; and word was brought
</p>
<p>him that several of the Shawanoe deputies w?:t
</p>
<p>returning to the fort, expressly to kill him. Undei
</p>
<p>these circumstances, it would have been madness
</p>
<p>to persevere ; and, abandoning his mission, he set
</p>
<p>out for Detroit. The Indian attendants, whom he
</p>
<p>had brought from Sandusky, after behaving with
</p>
<p>the utmost insolence, abandoned him in the woods ;
</p>
<p>their ringleader being a Christian Huron, of the
</p>
<p>Mission of Lorette, whom Morris pronounces the
</p>
<p>greatest rascal he ever knew. With Godefroy and
</p>
<p>two or three othei's who remained with him, he
</p>
<p>reached Detroit on the seventeenth of September,
</p>
<p>half dead with famine and fatigue. He had ex-
</p>
<p>pected to find Bradstreet ; but that agile commander
</p>
<p>had decamped, and returned to Sandusky. Morris,
</p>
<p>too ill and exhausted to follow, sent him his jour-
</p>
<p>nal, together with a letter, in which he denounced
</p>
<p>the Delaware and Shawanoe ambassadors, whom
</p>
<p>he regarded, and no doubt with justice, as the occa-
</p>
<p>sion of his misfortunes. The following is \m
</p>
<p>amiable conclusion : 
</p>
<p>" The villains have nipped our fairest hopes in
</p>
<p>the bud. I tremble for you at Sandusky ; though
</p>
<p>I was greatly pleased to find you have one of the
</p>
<p>vessels with you, and artillery. I wish the chiefs

</p>
<p>pleasure to deceive those who would deceive us." ^
</p>
<p>Bradstreet had retraced his course to Sandnsk),
</p>
<p>to keep his engagement with the Delaware and
</p>
<p>Shawanoe deputies, and await the fulfilment of
</p>
<p>their worthless promise to surrender their pris-
</p>
<p>oners, and conclude a definitive treaty of peace
</p>
<p>His hopes were defeated. The appointed time
</p>
<p>expired, and not a chief was seen ; though, a few-
</p>
<p>days after, several warriors came to the camp,
</p>
<p>with a promise that, if Bradstreet would remain
</p>
<p>quiet, and refrain from attacking their villages,
</p>
<p>they w^ould bring in the prisoners in the course
</p>
<p>of the following week. Bradstreet accepted their
</p>
<p>excuses ; and, having removed his camp to the
</p>
<p>carrying-place of Sandusky, lay waiting in patient
</p>
<p>expectation. It was here that he received, for the
</p>
<p>1 MS. Letter  il/oms to Bradstreet, 18 Sept. 1764.
</p>
<p>The journal sent by Morris to Bradstreet is in the State Paper Office
</p>
<p>of London. This journal, and the record of an examination of Morris's
</p>
<p>Indian and Canadian attendants, made in Bradstreet's presence at San-
</p>
<p>dusky, were the authorities on which the account in the first edition of
</p>
<p>this work was based. Morris afterwards rewrote his journal, with many
</p>
<p>additions. Eeturning to England after the war, he lost his property by
</p>
<p>speculations, and resolved, for tlie sake of his children, to solicit a pen-
</p>
<p>sion, on the score of his embassy to the Illinois. With this view it wag
</p>
<p>that the journal was rewritten ; but failing to find a suitable person to
</p>
<p>lay it before the King, he resolved to print it, together with several
</p>
<p>original poems and a translation of the fourth and fourteenth satires of
</p>
<p>Juvenal. The book appeared in 1791, under the title of Miscellanies in
</p>
<p>Prose and Verse. It is very scarce. I am indebted to the kindness of
</p>
<p>Mr. S. G. Drake for the opportunity of examining it.

<p>first time, a communication from General Gage,
</p>
<p>respecting the preliminary treaty, concluded several
</p>
<p>weeks before. Gage condemned his conduct in
</p>
<p>severe terms, and ordered him to break the engage-
</p>
<p>ments he had made, and advance at once upon the
</p>
<p>enemy, choosing for his first objects of attack the
</p>
<p>Indians living upon the plains of the Scioto. The
</p>
<p>fury of Bradstreet was great on receiving this mes
</p>
<p>sage; and it was not diminished when the jour-
</p>
<p>nal of Captain Morris was placed in his hands,
</p>
<p>fully proving how signally he had been duped.
</p>
<p>He was in no temper to obey the orders of the
</p>
<p>commander-in-chief; and, to justify himself foi
</p>
<p>his inaction, he alleged the impossibility of reach-
</p>
<p>ing the Scioto plains at that advanced season. Two
</p>
<p>routes thither were open to his choice, one by
</p>
<p>the Eiver Sandusky, and the other by Cayahoga
</p>
<p>Creek. The water in the Sandusky was sunk low
</p>
<p>with the drought, and the carrying-place at the
</p>
<p>head of Cayahoga Creek was a few miles longer
</p>
<p>than had been represented ; yet the army were
</p>
<p>ready for the attempt, and these difficulties could
</p>
<p>not have deterred a vigorous commander. Under
</p>
<p>cover of such excuses, Bradstreet remained idle at
</p>
<p>Sandusky for several days, while sickness and dis
</p>
<p>content were rife in his camp. The soldiers com-
</p>
<p>plained of his capricious, peremptory temper, his
</p>
<p>harshness to his troops, and the unaccountable
</p>
<p>tenderness with which he treated the Sandusky
</p>
<p>Indians, some of whom had not yet made their
</p>
<p>submission ; while he enraged his Iroquois allies by

</p>
<p>At length, declaring that provisions were failing
</p>
<p>and the season growing late, he resolved to return
</p>
<p>home ; and broke up his camp with such precipi
</p>
<p>tancy that two soldiers, who had gone out in the
</p>
<p>morning to catch fish for his table, were inhumanly
</p>
<p>left behind ; ^ the colonel remarking that they might

<p>he saw fit to encamp one evening on an open,
</p>
<p>exposed beach, on the south shore of Lake Erie,
</p>
<p>though there was in the neighborhood a large
</p>
<p>river, " wherein," say his critics, " a thousand boats
</p>
<p>could lie with safety." A storm came on : half
</p>
<p>his boats were dashed to pieces ; and six pieces
</p>
<p>of cannon, with ammunition, provisions, arms, and
</p>
<p>baggage, were lost or abandoned. For three days

<p>the tempest raged unceasingly ; and, when the

<p>found that the remaining boats were insufficient to

<p>and fifty in all, were therefore ordered to make
</p>
<p>their way to Niagara along the pathless borders of
</p>
<p>tlie lake. They accordingly set ont, and, after
</p>
<p>many days of hardship, reached their destination ;
</p>
<p>thoLigh snch had been their sufferings, from taii^ue^
</p>
<p>cold, and hunger ; from wa(Ung swamps, SAvimming
</p>
<p>creeks and rivers, and pushing their way through
</p>
<p>tangled thickets, tliat many of the provincials
</p>
<p>perished miserably in the woods. On the fourth
</p>
<p>of November, seventeen days after their departure
</p>
<p>from Sandusky, the main l)ody of the little army
</p>
<p>aixived in safety at Niagara ; and the whole, re-em-
</p>
<p>barking on Lake Ontario, proceeded towards
</p>
<p>Oswego.^ Fortune still seemed adverse ; for a
</p>
<p>second tempest arose, and one of the schooners,
</p>
<p>crowded with troops, foundered in sight of Oswego,
</p>
<p>though most of the men were saved. The route
</p>
<p>to the settlements was now a short and easy one.
</p>
<p>On their arrival, the regulars went into quarters ;
</p>
<p>while the troops levied for the campaign were
</p>
<p>sent home to their respective provinces.
</p>
<p>This expedition, ill conducted as it was, pro-
</p>
<p>duced some beneficial results. The Indians al

<p>present, at least, would probably remain tranquil ;
</p>
<p>while the re-establishment of the posts on the
</p>
<p>upper lakes must necessarily have great effect
</p>
<p>upon the natives of that region. At Sandusky,

<p>which promised an abundant harvest of future

<p>while they were roused to contempt by the imbe-
</p>
<p>cility of his conduct towards the enemy ; and
</p>
<p>thus the efforts of Sir William Johnson to secure
</p>
<p>the attachment of these powerful tribes were in no
</p>
<p>small degree counteracted and neutralized.^
</p>
<p>While Bradstreet's troops were advancing upon
</p>
<p>the lakes, or lying idle in their camp at Sandusky,
</p>
<p>another expedition was in progress at the south-
</p>
<p>ward, with abler conduct and a more auspicious
</p>
<p>result.

</p>
<p>2 The provincial officers, to wliom the command of the Indian allies
</p>
<p>was assigned, drew up a paper containing complaints against Bradstreet,
</p>
<p>and particulars of his misconduct during the expedition. This curious
</p>
<p>document, from which a few extracts have been given, was found among
</p>
<p>the private papers of Sir William Johnson.
</p>
<p>A curious discovery, in probable connection with Bradstreet's expedi-
</p>
<p>tion, has lately been made public. At McMahon's Beach, on Lake Erie,
</p>
<p>eight or ten milos west of Cleveland, a considerable number of bayonets,
</p>
<p>bullets, musket-barrels, and fragments of boats, have from time to time
</p>
<p>been washed by storms from the sands, or dug up on the adjacent shore,
</p>
<p>as well as an English silver-hilted sword, several silver spoons, and a fevT
</p>
<p>old French and English coins. A mound full of bones and skulls, appar-
</p>
<p>ently of Europeans hastily buried, has also been found at the same place
</p>
<p>The probability is strong that these are the remains of Bradstreet'a
</p>
<p>dieaeter. See a paper by D.'. J P Kirtland, in Wliittlesey's HUiory of

<p>BOUQUET FORCES THE DELA WARES AND SRAWANOBS
</p>
<p>TO SUE FOR PEACE.
</p>
<p>The work of ravage had begun afresh upon the
</p>
<p>borders. The Indians had taken the precaution to
</p>
<p>remove all their settlements to the western side of
</p>
<p>the River Muskingum, trusting that the impervious
</p>
<p>forests, with their unnumbered streams, would
</p>
<p>prove a sufficient barrier against invasion. Having
</p>
<p>thus, as they thought, placed their women and
</p>
<p>children in safety, they had flung themselves upon
</p>
<p>the settlements with all the rage and ferocity of the
</p>
<p>previous season. So fierce and active were the
</p>
<p>war-parties on the borders, that the English gov-
</p>
<p>ernor of Pennsylvania had recourse to a measure
</p>
<p>which the frontier inhabitants had long demanded,
</p>
<p>and issued a proclamation, ofl'ering a high bounty
</p>
<p>for Indian scalps, whether of men or women ; a
</p>
<p>baibarous expedient, fruitful of butcheries and
</p>
<p>murders, but incapable of producing any decisive
</p>
<p>tesult.^

<p>1764. j DAVID OWENS. 20 1
</p>
<p>Early in the season, a soldier named David
</p>
<p>Owens, who, several years before, had deserted and
</p>
<p>joined the Indians, came to one of the outposts,
</p>
<p>accompanied by a young provincial recently taken
</p>
<p>prisoner on the Delaware, and bringing five scalps.
</p>
<p>While living among the Indians, Owens had formed
</p>
<p>a connection with one of their women, who had
</p>
<p>borne him several children. Growing tired, at
</p>
<p>length, of the forest life, he had become anxious
</p>
<p>to return to the settlements, but feared to do so
</p>
<p>without first having made some atonement for
</p>
<p>his former desertion. One night, he had been
</p>
<p>encamped on the Susquehanna, with four Shawanoe
</p>
<p>persons not in the pay of tliis province, the following several and respec
</p>
<p>tive premiums and bounties for the prisoners and scalps of the enemy
</p>
<p>Indians that shall be taken or killed within the bounds of this province, aa
</p>
<p>limited by the royal charter, or in pursuit from within the said bounds ;
</p>
<p>that is to say, for every male Indian enemy above ten years old, who
</p>
<p>shall be taken prisoner, and delivered at any forts garrisoned hy the troops
</p>
<p>in the pay of this province, or at any of the county towns, to the keeper
</p>
<p>of the common jails there, the sum of one hundred and fifty Spanish
</p>
<p>dollars, or pieces of eiglit. For every female Indian enemy, taken pris-
</p>
<p>oner and brought in as aforesaid, and for every male Indian enemy of ten
</p>
<p>years old or under, taken prisoner and delivered as aforesaid, the sum of
</p>
<p>one hundred and thirty pieces of eight. For the scalp of every male Indian
</p>
<p>enemy above the age of ten years, produced as evidence of their being
</p>
<p>killed, the sum of one hundred and thirty-four pieces of eight. And for
</p>
<p>the scalp of every female Indian enemy above tiie age of ten years, pro-
</p>
<p>duced as evidence of their being killed, the sum of filty pieces of eight."
</p>
<p>The action of such measures has recently been illustrated in the
</p>
<p>instance of }iew Mexico before its conquest by the Americans. The
</p>
<p>inhabitants of that country, too timorous to defend themselves against
</p>
<p>the Apaches and other tribes, who descended upon them in frequent
</p>
<p>forays from the neighboring mountains, took into pay a band of foreigners,

</p>
<p>chiefly American trappers, for whom the Apache lances had no such
</p>
<p>terrors, and, to stimulate their exertions, proclaimed a bounty on scalps.
</p>
<p>The success of the measure was judged admirable, until it was found that
</p>
<p>the unscrupulous confederates were in the habit of shooting down any
</p>
<p>jJndian, whether friend or enemy, who came within range of their rifles,
</p>
<p>and that the government had been paying rewards for the scalps of its
</p>
<p>own allies and dependants.

<p>warriors, a boy of the same tribe, his own wife and
</p>
<p>tv/o children, and another Indian w^oman. The
</p>
<p>young provincial, who came with him to the set-
</p>
<p>tlements, was also of the party. In the middle of
</p>
<p>the night, Owens arose, and looking about him
</p>
<p>saw, by the dull glow of the camp-fire, that all
</p>
<p>were buried in deep sleep. Cautiously awakening
</p>
<p>the young provincial, he told him to leave the
</p>
<p>place, and lie quiet at a Httle distance, until he
</p>
<p>should call him. He next stealthily removed the
</p>
<p>weapons from beside the sleeping savages, and
</p>
<p>concealed them in the woods, reserving to himself
</p>
<p>two loaded rifles. Returning to the camp, he knelt
</p>
<p>on the ground between two of the yet unconscious
</p>
<p>warriors, and, pointing a rifle at the head of each,
</p>
<p>touched the triggers, and shot both dead at once.
</p>
<p>Startled by the reports, the survivors sprang to
</p>
<p>their feet in bewildered terror. The two remaining
</p>
<p>warriors bounded into the woods ; but the women
</p>
<p>and children, benumbed with fright, had no power
</p>
<p>to escape, and one and all died shrieking under the
</p>
<p>hatchet of the miscreant. His devilish work com-
</p>
<p>plete, the wretch sat watching until daylight among
</p>
<p>the dead bodies of his children and comrades, un-
</p>
<p>daunted by the awful gloom and solitude of the
</p>
<p>darkened forest. In the morning, he scalped his
</p>
<p>victims, with the exception of the two children,
</p>
<p>and, followed by the young white man, directed
</p>
<p>his steps towards the settlements, with the bloody
</p>
<p>trophies of his atrocity. His desertion was par-
</p>
<p>doned ; he was employed as an interpreter, and

</p>

</p>
<p>Bouquet was now urging on liis preparations for
</p>
<p>his march into tlie valley of the Ohio. V^e have
</p>
<p>seen how, in the preceding summer, he had been
</p>
<p>embarrassed by what he calls " the unnatural obsti-
</p>
<p>nacy of the government of Pennsylvania." " It
</p>
<p>disables us," he had written to the equally indig-
</p>
<p>nant Amherst, " from crushing the savages on this
</p>
<p>side of the lakes, and may draw us into a lingering
</p>
<p>war, which might have been terminated by another

<p>blow. ... I see that tlie whole burden of this war

<p>"David Owens was a Corporal in Capt. McCiean's Conipy., and lay

<p>Amongst them.

<p>told me by several Indians. That he went out a hunting wiih his Indian

<p>Wife and several of her relations, most of wliom, with his Wife, he killed
</p>
<p>and scalped as they slept. As he was always much attached to Indians,
</p>
<p>I fancy he began to fear he was unsafe amongst them, & killed them

<p>rather to make his jieace witii tlie Knglish, than from any ilislike either

<p>had, equally in vain, sent Colonel James Robertson
</p>
<p>as a special messenger to the provincial commis-
</p>
<p>sioners. " I found all my pleading vain," the dis-
</p>
<p>appointed envoy had written, " and believe Cicero's
</p>
<p>would have been so. I never saw any men so
</p>
<p>determined in the right as these people are in this
</p>
<p>absurdly wrong resolve." ^ The resolve in question
</p>
<p>related to the seven hundred men whom the As-
</p>
<p>sembly had voted to raise for protecting the gather-
</p>
<p>ing of the harvest, and whom the commissioners
</p>
<p>stiffly refused to place at the disposition of the
</p>
<p>military authorities.
</p>
<p>It is apparent in all this that, at an early period
</p>
<p>of the war, a change had come over the spirit of
</p>
<p>the commander-in-chief, whose prejudices and pride
</p>
<p>had revolted, at the outset, against the asking of
</p>
<p>provincial aid to " chastise the savages," but who
</p>
<p>had soon been brought to reason by his own help-
</p>
<p>lessness and the exigencies of the situation. In
</p>
<p>like manner, a change, though at the eleventh
</p>
<p>hour, had now come over the spirit of the Penn
</p>
<p>sylvania Assembly. The invasion of the Paxton
</p>
<p>borderers, during the past winter, had scared the
</p>
<p>Quaker faction into their senses. Their old quar-
</p>
<p>with, can have no effect in opening the hearts of your Assembly to exert
</p>
<p>themselves like men, I am sure no arguments I could urge will be
</p>
<p>regarded,"  Amherst to Governor Hamilton, 7 July, 1763.
</p>
<p>"The situation of this country is deplorable, and the infatuation cf
</p>
<p>their government in taking the most dilatory and ineffectual measures for
</p>
<p>their protection, highly blamable. They have not paid the least regard
</p>
<p>to the plan I proposed to them on my arrival here, and will lose this and
</p>
<p>York counties if the savages push their attacks."  Ihitgmt to Amherst,

</p>
<p>scruples about war, and their affection for Indians,
</p>
<p>were all postponed to the necessity of the hour.
</p>
<p>The Assembly voted to raise three hundred men
</p>
<p>to guard the frontiers, and a thousand to join Bou-

</p>
<p>promised to send to England for fifty couples of
</p>
<p>bloodhounds, to hunt Indian scalping-parties.^
</p>
<p>In the preceding summer, half as many men
</p>
<p>would have sufficed ; for, after the battle of Bushy
</p>
<p>Run, Bouquet wrote to Amherst from Fort Pitt,
</p>
<p>that, with a reinforcement of three hundred provin
</p>
<p>cial rangers, he could destroy all the ]3elaware
</p>
<p>towns, *' and clear the country of that vermin
</p>
<p>between this fort and Lake Erie ; " ^ but he added,
</p>
<p>with some bitterness, that the provinces would not
</p>
<p>even furnish escorts to convoys, so that his hands
</p>
<p>were completely tied.'
</p>
<p>It was past midsummer before the thousand

<p>Pennsylvanians were ready to move ; so that the

<p>season for navigating the Ohio and its branches
</p>
<p>was lost. As for Virginia and Maryland, the^
</p>
<p>would do absolutely nothing. On the fifth of
</p>
<p>\ugust, Bouquet was at Carlisle, with his new
</p>
<p>levies and such regulars as he had, chiefly the
</p>
<p>veterans of Bushy Eun. Before the tenth, two
</p>
<p>hundred of the Pennsylvanians had deserted, shel
</p>
<p>tered, as usual, by the country people. His force,
</p>
<p>even with full ranks, was too small ; and he now
</p>
<p>took the responsibility of writing to Colonel Lewis,
</p>
<p>of the Virginia militia, to send him two hundred
</p>
<p>volunteers, to take the place of the deserters.^ A
</p>
<p>body of Virginians accordingly joined him at Fort
</p>
<p>Pitt, to his great satisfaction, for he set a high
</p>
<p>value on these backwoods riflemen ; but the respon-
</p>
<p>sibility he had assumed proved afterwards a source
</p>
<p>of extreme annoyance to him.
</p>
<p>The little army soon reached Fort Loudon, then
</p>
<p>in a decayed and ruinous condition, like all the
</p>
<p>wooden forts built during the French war. Here
</p>
<p>Bouquet received the strange communication from
</p>
<p>Bradstreet, informing him that he might return home
</p>
<p>with his troops, as a treaty had been concluded with
</p>
<p>the Delawares and Shawanoes. Bouquet's disgust
</p>
<p>found vent in a letter to the commander-in-chief*

<p>" I received this moment advice from Colonel Brad-
</p>

</p>
<p>After waiting for more than a week for his wrath
</p>
<p>to cool, he wrote to Bradstreet in terms which,
</p>
<p>though restrained and temperate, plainly showed
</p>
<p>his indignation.^ He had now reached Fort Bed-

<p>2 April, 1764. A small boy, captured with his motlicr the summer before,
</p>
<p>escaped to the fort about this time, and reported that the Indians meant to
</p>
<p>plant their corn and provide for their families, after which they would
</p>
<p>come to the fort and burn it. The youthful informant also declared that
</p>
<p>none of them had more than a pound of powder left. Soon after, a man
</p>
<p>named Hicks appeared, professing to have escaped from the Indians,
</p>
<p>though he was strongly suspected of being a renegade and a spy, and was
</p>
<p>therefore cross-questioned severely. He confirmed what the boy ha(?
</p>
<p>8aid as to the want of ammunition among the Indians, and added that
</p>
<p>they had sent for a supply to the French at the Illinois, but that the
</p>
<p>reception they received from the commandant had not satisfied them

<p>General Gage sent the following not very judicial instructions with regard
</p>
<p>to Hicks : " He is a great villain. I am glad he is secured. I must
</p>
<p>desire you will have him tried by a general Court-Martial for a Spy. Let
</p>
<p>the proceedings of the Court prove him a Spy as strong as thej' can, and
</p>
<p>if he does turn out a spy, he must be hanged."  Gage to Bouquet, 14 May,
</p>
<p>1764. The court, however, could find no proof.

<p>i76f. Sepp.] his message TO THE DELA WAKES 20^
</p>
<p>to confer with the English commander. Three of
</p>
<p>them, after much hesitation, came over to the fort,
</p>
<p>where, being closely questioned, and found unable
</p>
<p>to give any good account of their mission, they
</p>
<p>were detained as spies ; while their companions,
</p>
<p>greatly disconcerted, fled back to their villages.
</p>
<p>Bouquet, on his arrival, released one of the three
</p>
<p>captives, and sent him home with the following
</p>
<p>message to his people : 
</p>
<p>" I have received an account, from Colonel Brad-
</p>
<p>street, that your nations had begged for peace,
</p>
<p>which he had consented to grant, upon assurance
</p>
<p>that you had recalled all your warriors from our fron
</p>
<p>tiers ; and, in consequence of this, I would not have
</p>
<p>proceeded against your towns, if I had not heard
</p>
<p>that, in open violation of your engagements, you
</p>
<p>have since murdered several of our people.
</p>
<p>" I was therefore determined to have attacked
</p>
<p>you, as a people whose promises can no more be
</p>
<p>relied on. But I will put it once more in your
</p>
<p>power to save yourselves and youi families from
</p>
<p>total destruction, by giving us satisfaction for the
</p>
<p>hostilities committed against us. And, first, you
</p>
<p>are to leave the path open for my expresses from
</p>
<p>hence to Detroit ; and as I am now to send two
</p>
<p>men with despatches to Colonel Bradstreet, who
</p>
<p>commands on the lakes, I desire to know whether
</p>
<p>you will send two of your people to bring them
</p>
<p>safe back with an answer. And if they receive
</p>
<p>any injury either in going or coming, or if the let-
</p>
<p>ters are taken from them, I will immediately put
</p>
<p>the Indians now in my power to death, and will

</p>
<p>show no mercy, for the future, to any of your
</p>
<p>nations that shall fall into my hands. I allow you
</p>
<p>ten days to have my letters delivered at Detroitj
</p>
<p>and ten days to bring me back an answer." ^
</p>
<p>The liberated spy faithfully discharged his mis-
</p>
<p>sion ; and the firm, decisive tone of the message had
</p>
<p>a profound effect upon the hostile warriors ; clearly
</p>
<p>indicating, as it did, with what manner of man they
</p>
<p>had to deal. Many, who were before clamorous
</p>
<p>for battle, were now ready to sue for peace, as the
</p>
<p>only means to avert their ruin.
</p>
<p>Before the army was ready to march, two Iro
</p>
<p>quois warriors came to the fort, pretending friend-
</p>
<p>ship, but anxious, in reality, to retard the expedition
</p>
<p>until the approaching winter should make it impos
</p>
<p>sible to proceed. They represented the numbers
</p>
<p>of the eneniy, and the extreme difficulty of pene-
</p>
<p>trating so rough a country ; and afhvmed that, if the
</p>
<p>troops remained quiet, the hostile tribes, who were
</p>
<p>already collecting their prisoners, would soon arrive
</p>
<p>to make their submission. Bouquet turned a deaf
</p>
<p>ear to their advice, and sent them to inform the
</p>
<p>Delawares and Shawanoes that he was on his way
</p>
<p>to chastise them for their perfidy and cruelty,
</p>
<p>unless they should save themselves by an ample
</p>
<p>and speedy atonement.
</p>
<p>Early in October, the troops left Fort Pitt, and
</p>
<p>began their westward march into a wilderness which
</p>
<p>no army had ever before sought to penetrate. En-
</p>
<p>cumbered with their camp equipage, with droves
</p>
<p>of cattle and sheep for subsistence, and a long train

</p>
<p>of pack-horses laden with provisions, their prog-
</p>
<p>ress was tedious and difficult, and seven or eight
</p>
<p>miles were the ordinary measure of a day's march.
</p>
<p>The woodsmen of Virginia, veteran hunters and
</p>
<p>Indian-fighters, yveve thrown far out in front and
</p>
<p>on either flank, scouring the forest to detect any
</p>
<p>sign of a lurking ambuscade. The pioneers toiled
</p>
<p>in tlie van, hewing their Avay through woods and
</p>
<p>thickets ; while the army dragged its weary length
</p>
<p>behind them through the- forest, like a serpent
</p>
<p>creeping through tall grass. The surrounding
</p>
<p>country, whenever a casual opening in the matted
</p>
<p>foliage gave a glimpse of its features, disclosed
</p>
<p>scenery of wild, primeval beauty. Sometimes the
</p>
<p>army defiled along the margin of the Ohio, by
</p>
<p>its broad eddying current and the bright landscape
</p>
<p>of its shores. Sometimes they descended into the
</p>
<p>thickest gloom of the woods, damp, still, and cool
</p>
<p>as the recesses of a cavern, where the black soil
</p>
<p>oozed beneath the tread, where the rough coluinns
</p>
<p>of the forest seemed to exude a clammy sweat,
</p>
<p>and the slimy mosses were trickling with moisture ;
</p>
<p>while the carcasses of prostrate trees, green with
</p>
<p>the decay of a century, sank into pulp at the light-
</p>
<p>est pressure of the foot. More frequently, the
</p>
<p>forest was of a fresher growth ; and the restless
</p>
<p>leaves of young maples and basswood shook down
</p>
<p>spots of sunlight on the marching columns. Some-
</p>
<p>times they waded the clear current of a stream,
</p>
<p>with its vistas of arching foliage and sparkling
</p>
<p>water. There were intervals, but these were rare,

</p>
<p>of woods, they emerged into the light of an open
</p>
<p>meadow, rich with herbage, and girdled by a zone
</p>
<p>of forest ; gladdened by the notes of birds, and
</p>
<p>enlivened, it may be, by grazing herds of deer.
</p>
<p>These spots, welcome to the forest traveller as an
</p>
<p>oasis to a wanderer in the desert, form the precur-
</p>
<p>sors of the prairies ; which, growing wider and more
</p>
<p>frequent as one advances westward, expand at last
</p>
<p>into the boundless plains beyond the Mississippi.
</p>
<p>On the tenth day after leaving Fort Pitt, the army
</p>
<p>reached the Hiver Muskingum, and approached the
</p>
<p>objects of their march, the haunts of the barbarian
</p>
<p>warriors, who had turned whole districts into deso-
</p>
<p>lation. Their progress had met no interruption. A
</p>
<p>few skulking Indians had hovered about them,
</p>
<p>but, alarmed by their numbers, feared to venture
</p>
<p>an attack. The Indian cabins which they passed
</p>
<p>on their way were deserted by their tenants, who
</p>
<p>had joined their western brethren. When the
</p>
<p>troops crossed the Muskingum, they saw, a little
</p>
<p>beloAV the fording-place, the abandoned wigwams
</p>
<p>of the village of Tuscaroras, recently the abode of
</p>
<p>more than a hundred families, who had fled in
</p>
<p>terror at the approach of the invaders.
</p>
<p>Bouquet was in the heart of the enemy's country.
</p>
<p>Their villages, except some remoter settlements of
</p>
<p>the Shawanoes, all lay within a few days' march ;
</p>
<p>and no other choice was left them than to sue for
</p>
<p>peace, or risk the desperate chances of battle
</p>
<p>against a commander who, a year before, with a
</p>
<p>third of his present force, had routed them at the

</p>
<p>umong them might, it is true, escape by flight ; but,
</p>
<p>in doing so, they must abandon to the victors theii
</p>
<p>dwellings, and their secret hordes of corn. They
</p>
<p>were confounded at the multitude of the invaders,
</p>
<p>exaggerated, doubtless, in the reports which reached
</p>
<p>their villages, and amazed that an army should
</p>
<p>force its way so deep into the forest fastnesses,
</p>
<p>which they had thought impregnable. They knew,
</p>
<p>on the otlier hand, that Colonel Bradstreet was still
</p>
<p>at Sandusky, in a position to assail them in the
</p>
<p>rear. Thus pressed on both sides, they saw that
</p>
<p>they must submit, and bend their stubborn pride
</p>
<p>to beg for peace ; not alone with words, which cost
</p>
<p>nothing, and would have been worth nothing, but
</p>
<p>by the delivery of prisoners, and the surrender of
</p>
<p>chiefs and warriors as pledges of good faith. Bou-
</p>
<p>quet had sent two soldiers from Fort Pitt with
</p>
<p>letters to Colonel Bradstreet ; but these men had
</p>
<p>been detained, under specious pretexts, by the Del-
</p>
<p>awares. They now appeared at his camp, sent
</p>
<p>back by their captors, with a message to the effect
</p>
<p>that, within a few days, the chiefs would arrive and
</p>
<p>hold a conference with him.
</p>
<p>Bouquet continued his march down the valley of
</p>
<p>tlie Muskingum, until he reached a spot where the
</p>
<p>broad meadows, which bordered the river, would
</p>
<p>supply abundant grazing for the cattle and horses ;
</p>
<p>while the terraces above, shaded by forest-trees,
</p>
<p>offered a convenient site for an encampment. Here
</p>
<p>he began to erect a small palisade work, as a depot
</p>
<p>for stores and baggage. Before the task was com-

<p>plete, a deputation of chiefs arrived, bringing word
</p>
<p>214 BOUQUET IN THE INDIAN COUNTRY. [1764, Oct
</p>
<p>that their warriors were encamped, in great num-
</p>
<p>bers, about eight miles from the spot, and desiring
</p>
<p>Bouquet to appoint the time and place for a coun-
</p>
<p>cil. He ordered them to meet him, on the next
</p>
<p>day, at a point near the margin of the river, a little
</p>
<p>below the camp ; and thither a party of men was
</p>
<p>at once despatched, to erect a sort of rustic arbor
</p>
<p>of saplings and the boughs of trees, large enough
</p>
<p>to shelter the English officers and the Indian chiefs.
</p>
<p>With a host of warriors in the neighborhood, who
</p>
<p>would gladly break in upon them, could they hope
</p>
<p>that the attack would succeed, it behooved the Eng-
</p>
<p>lish to use every precaution. A double guard was
</p>
<p>placed, and a stringent discipline enforced.
</p>
<p>In the morning, the little army moved in battle
</p>
<p>order to the place of council. Here the principal
</p>
<p>officers assumed their seats under the canopy of
</p>
<p>branches, while the glittering array of the troopa
</p>
<p>was drawn out on the meadow in front, in such a
</p>
<p>manner as to produce the most imposing effect on
</p>
<p>the minds of the Indians, in whose eyes the sight
</p>
<p>of fifteen hundred men under arms was a spectacle
</p>
<p>equally new and astounding. The perfect ordBr
</p>
<p>and silence of the far-extended lines ; the ridges
</p>
<p>of bayonets flashing in the sun ; the fluttering tar-
</p>
<p>tans of the Highland regulars ; the bright red
</p>
<p>uniform of the Koyal Americans ; the darker garb
</p>
<p>and duller trappings of the Pennsylvania troops,
</p>
<p>and the bands of Virginia backwoodsmen, who, in
</p>
<p>fringed hunting-frocks and Indian moccasons, stood
</p>
<p>leaning carelessly on their rifles,  all these com-
</p>
<p>bined to form a scene of military pomp and power

</p>
<p>i<64, Oct] SPEECH OF THE DELAWARE ORATOR. 215
</p>
<p>At the appointed hour, the deputation appeared.
</p>
<p>The most prominent among them were Kiashuta,
</p>
<p>chief of the band of Senecas who had deserted
</p>
<p>their ancient homes to form a colony on the Ohio ;
</p>
<p>Custaloga, chief of the Dehiwares; and the head
</p>
<p>chief of the Shawanoes, whose name sets ortho-
</p>
<p>graphy at defiance. As they approached, painted
</p>
<p>and plumed in all their savage pomp, they looked
</p>
<p>neither to the right hand nor to the left, not deigning, '
</p>
<p>under the eyes of their enemy, to cast even a glance
</p>
<p>at the military display around them. They seated
</p>
<p>themselves, with stern, impassive looks, and an air
</p>
<p>of sullen dignity ; while their sombre brows betrayed
</p>
<p>the hatred still rankling in their hearts. After a
</p>
<p>few minutes had been consumed in the indispen
</p>
<p>sable ceremony of smoking. Turtle Heart, a chief
</p>
<p>of the Delawares, and orator of the deputation,
</p>
<p>rose, bearing in his hand a bag containing the belts
</p>
<p>of wampum. Addressing himself to the English
</p>
<p>commander, he spoke as follows, delivering a belt
</p>
<p>for every clause of his speech : 
</p>
<p>" Brother, I speak in behalf of the three nations
</p>
<p>whose chiefs are here present. With this belt i
</p>
<p>open your ears and your hearts, that you may listen
</p>
<p>to my words.
</p>
<p>" Brother, this war was neither your fault nor .
</p>
<p>ours. It was the work of the nations who live to
</p>
<p>the westward, and of our wild young men, who
</p>
<p>would have killed us if we had resisted them. We I
</p>
<p>now put away all evil from our hearts ; and we 1

</p>
<p>" Brother, it is the will of the Great Spirit thai
</p>
<p>there should be peace between u We, on our
</p>
<p>side, now take fast hold of the chain of friendship ;
</p>
<p>but, as we cannot hold it alone, we desire that you
</p>
<p>will take hold also, and we must look up to the
</p>
<p>Great Spirit, that he may make us strong, and not
</p>
<p>permit this chain to fall from our hands.
</p>
<p>" Brother, these words come from our hearts,
</p>
<p>and not from our lips. You desire that we should
</p>
<p>deliver up your flesh and blood now captive among
</p>
<p>us ; and, to show you that we are sincere, we now
</p>
<p>return you as many of them as we have at pres-
</p>
<p>ent been able to bring. [Here he delivered eigh
</p>
<p>teen white prisoners, who had been brought by the
</p>
<p>deputation to the council.] You shall receive the
</p>
<p>rest as soon as we have time to collect them." ^
</p>
<p>In such figurative terms, not devoid of dignity,
</p>
<p>did the Indian orator sue for peace to his detested
</p>
<p>enemies. When he had concluded, the chiefs of
</p>
<p>every tribe rose in succession, to express concur-
</p>
<p>rence in what he had said, each delivering a belt
</p>
<p>of wampum and a bundle of small sticks ; the latter
</p>
<p>designed to indicate the number of English prison
</p>
<p>ers whom his followers retained, and whom he
</p>
<p>pledged himself to surrender. In an Indian coun

</p>
<p>matter of weight and urgency, the other party
</p>
<p>defers his reply to the following day, that due time
</p>
<p>may be allowed for deliberation. Accordingly, in
</p>
<p>the present instance, the council adjourned to the
</p>
<p>next morning, each party retiring to its respective
</p>
<p>camp. But, when day dawned, the weather had
</p>
<p>changed. The valley of the Muskingum was filled
</p>
<p>with driving mist and rain, and the meeting was in
</p>
<p>consequence postponed. On the third day, the
</p>
<p>landscape brightened afresh, the troops marched
</p>
<p>once more to the place of council, and the Indian
</p>
<p>chiefs convened to hear the reply of their trium-
</p>
<p>phant foe. It was not of a kind to please them.
</p>
<p>The opening words gave an earnest of what was to
</p>
<p>come ; for Bouquet discarded the usual address of
</p>
<p>an Indian harangue : fathers, brothers, or chil-
</p>
<p>dren,  terms which imply a relation of friendship,
</p>
<p>or a desire to conciliate,  and adopted a sterner f

</p>
<p>young men, it was your duty to punish them, if
</p>
<p>they did amiss. You have drawn down our just
</p>
<p>resentment by your violence and perfidy. Last
</p>
<p>summer, in cold blood, and in a time of profound
</p>
<p>peace, you robbed and murdered the traders, who
</p>
<p>had come among you at your own express desire.
</p>
<p>You attacked Fort Pitt, which was built by your
</p>
<p>consent ; and you destroyed our outposts and garri-
</p>
<p>sons, whenever treachery could place them in your
</p>
<p>power. You assailed our troops  the same who
</p>
<p>now stand before you  in the woods at Bushy

<p>you sent your scalping-parties to the frontier, and

<p>that you would never lay down the hatchet. After-
</p>
<p>wards, when Colonel Bradstreet came up Lake
</p>
<p>Erie, you sent a deputation of your chiefs, and
</p>
<p>concluded a treaty with him ; but your engage-
</p>
<p>ments were no sooner made than broken ; and,
</p>
<p>from that day to this, you have scalped and butch
</p>
<p>ered us without ceasing. Nay, I am informed that,
</p>
<p>when )0U heard that this army was penetrating
</p>
<p>the woods, you mustered your warriors to attack
</p>
<p>us, and w^ere only deterred from doing so when
</p>
<p>you found how greatly we outnumbered you.

<p>This is not the only instance of your bad faith ;

</p>
<p>for, since the beginning of the last war, you have
</p>
<p>made repeated treaties with us, and promised to
</p>
<p>give up your prisoners ; but you have never kept
</p>
<p>these engagements, nor any others. We shall
</p>
<p>endure this no longer; and I am now come
</p>
<p>among you to force you to make atonement for the
</p>
<p>injuries you have done us. I have brought with
</p>
<p>me the relatives of those }ou have murdered.
</p>
<p>They are eager for vengeance, and nothing re-
</p>
<p>strains them from taking it but my assurance that
</p>
<p>this army shall not leave your country until you
</p>
<p>have given them an ample satisfaction.
</p>
<p>" Your allies, the Ottawas, Ojibwas, and Wyan
</p>
<p>dots, have begged for peace ; the Six Nations hav(^
</p>
<p>leagued themselves with us ; the great lakes and
</p>
<p>rivers around you are all in our possession, and
</p>
<p>your friends the French are in subjection to us,
</p>
<p>and can do no more to aid you. You are all in
</p>
<p>our power, and, if we choose, we can exterminate
</p>
<p>you from the earth ; but the English are a merciful
</p>
<p>and generous people, averse to shed the blood even
</p>
<p>of their greatest enemies ; and if it were possible
</p>
<p>that you could convince us that you sincerely
</p>
<p>repent of your past perfidy, and that we could
</p>
<p>depend on your good behavior for the future, you
</p>
<p>might yet hope for mercy and peace. If I find
</p>
<p>that you faithfully execute the conditions which I
</p>
<p>shall prescribe, I will not treat you with the sever-
</p>
<p>ity you deserve.

<p>women, and children ; whether adopted hi to your
</p>
<p>tribes, married, or living among you under any
</p>
<p>denomination or pretence whatsoever. And you
</p>
<p>are to furnish these prisoners with clothing, pro-
</p>
<p>visions, and horses, to carry them to Fort Pitt.
</p>
<p>When you have fully complied with these condi-
</p>
<p>tions, you shall then know on what terms you ma)-
</p>
<p>obtain the peace you sue for."
</p>
<p>This speech, with the stern voice and counte
</p>
<p>nance of the speaker, told with chilling effect
</p>
<p>upon the awe-stricken hearers. It quelled their
</p>
<p>native haughtiness, and sunk them to the depths
</p>
<p>of humiliation. Their speeches in reply were dull
</p>
<p>\ and insipid, void of that savage eloquence, which,
</p>
<p>springing from a wild spirit of independence, has
</p>
<p>so often distinguished the forest orators. Judging
</p>
<p>the temper of their enemies by their own insatiable
</p>
<p>thirst for vengeance, they hastened, with all the
</p>
<p>alacrity of terror, to fulfil the prescribed conditions,
</p>
<p>and avert the threatened ruin. They dispersed to
</p>
<p>their different villages, to collect and bring in the
</p>
<p>prisoners ; while Bouquet, on his part, knowing
</p>
<p>that his best security for their good faith was to
</p>
<p>keep up the alarm which his decisive measures
</p>
<p>had created, determined to march yet nearer to
</p>
<p>their settlements. Still following the course of
</p>
<p>the Muskingum, he descended to a spot near its
</p>
<p>confluence witli its main branch, which might be
</p>
<p>regarded as a central point witli respect to the sur-
</p>
<p>rounding Indian villages. Here, with the exception
</p>
<p>of the distant Shawanoe settlenunts, they were all

<p>within reach of his Jiand, and he could readily
</p>
<p>1704, Oc'.j MILITARY ENCAMPMENT. J2l
</p>
<p>chastise the first attempt at deceit or evasion. The
</p>
<p>principal chiefs of each tribe had been forced to
</p>
<p>accompany him as hostages.^
</p>
<p>For the space of a day, hundreds of axes were
</p>
<p>busy at their work. The trees were felled, tlie
</p>
<p>ground cleared, and, with marvellous rapidity, a
</p>
<p>town sprang up in the heart of the wilderness,
</p>
<p>martial in aspect and rigorous in discipline ; with
</p>
<p>storehouses, hospitals, and works of defence, rude
</p>
<p>sylvan cabins mingled with white tents, and the
</p>
<p>forest rearing its sombre rampart around the whole.
</p>
<p>On one side of this singular encampment was a
</p>
<p>range of buildings, designed to receive the expected
</p>
<p>prisoners ; and matrons, brought for this ])urpose
</p>
<p>with the army, were appointed to take charge of
</p>
<p>the women and children among them. At the
</p>
<p>opposite side, a canopy of branches, sustained on
</p>
<p>the upright trunks of young trees, formed a rude
</p>
<p>council-hall, in keeping with the savage assembly
</p>
<p>for whose reception it was designed.
</p>
<p>And now, issuing from the forest, came warriors
</p>
<p>1 The following is from a letter of Bouquet dated Camp near Tusca
</p>
<p>rawas, 96 miles west of Fort Pitt, 21st Oct. 1764 : " They came accor
</p>
<p>dingly on the 15'** and met me here, to where I had moved the camp.
</p>
<p>Time does not permit me to send you all the messages which have passed
</p>
<p>since, and the conferences I have had with them, as we are going to
</p>

</p>
<p>the utmost submission, and have agreed to deliver into my hands all their
</p>
<p>prisoners, who appear to be very numerous, on the 1** of November , and.
</p>
<p>as I will not leave any thing undone, they have not only consented that
</p>
<p>I should march to their towns, but have given me four of their men to

</p>
<p>conducting troops of prisoners, or leading captive
</p>
<p>children,  wild young barbarians, born perhaps
</p>
<p>among themselves, and scarcely to be distinguished
</p>
<p>from their own. Yet, seeing the sullen reluctance
</p>
<p>which the Indians soon betrayed in this ungrateful
</p>
<p>task. Bouquet thought it expedient to stimulate
</p>
<p>their efforts by sending detachments of soldiers to
</p>
<p>each of the villages, still retaining the, chiefs in
</p>
<p>pledge for their safety. About this time, a Cana-
</p>
<p>dian officer, named Hcrtel, with a party of Caugh-
</p>
<p>nawaga Indians, arrived with a letter from Colonel
</p>
<p>Bradstrect, dated at Sandusky. The writer declared
</p>
<p>that he Avas unable to remain longer in the Indian
</p>
<p>country, and was on the point of retiring down
</p>
<p>Lake Erie with his army ; a movement which, at
</p>
<p>the least, was of doubtful necessity, and which
</p>
<p>miaht have involved the most disastrous conse-
</p>
<p>quences. Had the tidings been received but a few
</p>
<p>days sooner, the whole effect of Bouquet's meas-
</p>
<p>ures would probably have been destroyed, the
</p>
<p>Indians encouraged to resistance, and the war
</p>
<p>brought to the arbitration of a battle, which must
</p>
<p>needs have been a fierce and bloody one. But,
</p>
<p>happily for both parties. Bouquet now had his
</p>
<p>enemies firmly in his grasp, and the boldest warrior
</p>
<p>dared not violate the truce.
</p>
<p>The messengers who brought the letter of Brad-
</p>
<p>street brought also the tidings that peace was made
</p>
<p>with the northern Indians ; but stated, at the same
</p>
<p>time, that these tribes had murdered many of their
</p>
<p>captives, and given up but few of the remainder,

<p>60 that no small number were still within their

</p>
<p>power. The conduct of Bradstreet in this matter
</p>
<p>was the more disgraceful, since he had been
</p>
<p>encamped for weeks almost within gunsliot of
</p>
<p>the Wyandot villages at Sandusky, where most
</p>
<p>of the prisoners were detained. Bouquet, on his
</p>
<p>part, though separated from this place by a journey
</p>
<p>of many days, resolved to take upon himself tlia
</p>
<p>duty ^vhich his brother officer liad strangely neg-
</p>
<p>lected. He sent an embassy to Sandusky, demand
</p>
<p>ing that, the prisoners should be surrendered. This
</p>
<p>measure was in a great degree successful. He
</p>
<p>despatched messengers soon after to the principal
</p>
<p>Shawanoe village, on the Scioto, distant about
</p>
<p>eighty miles from his camp, to rouse the inhabi-
</p>
<p>tants to a greater activity than they seemed
</p>
<p>inclined to display. This was a fortunate step ;
</p>
<p>for the Shawanoes of the Scioto, who had been
</p>
<p>guilty of atrocious cruelties during the war, had
</p>
<p>conceived the idea that they were excluded from
</p>
<p>the general amnesty, and marked out for destruc-
</p>
<p>tion. This notion had been propagated, and per-
</p>
<p>haps suggested, by the French traders in their
</p>
<p>villages ; and so thorough was the conviction of
</p>
<p>the Shaw^anoes, that they came to the desperate
</p>
<p>purpose of murdering their prisoners, and march-
</p>
<p>ing, with all the warriors they could muster, to
</p>
<p>attack the English. This plan was no sooner
</p>
<p>formed than the French traders opened their stores
</p>
<p>of bullets and gunpowder, and dealt them out
</p>
<p>freely to the Indians. Bouquet's messengers came
</p>
<p>in time to prevent the catastrophe, and relieve the

<p>terrors of the Shawanoes, by the assurance that
</p>
<p>224 BOUQUET IN THE INDIAN COUNTRY, i i<b4, Nov
</p>
<p>peace would be granted to them on the same
</p>
<p>conditions as to the rest. Thus encouraged, they
</p>
<p>abandoned their design, and set ouc with hghter
</p>
<p>hearts for the English camp, bringing with them a
</p>
<p>portion of their prisoners. When about half-way
</p>
<p>on their journey, they were met by an Indian run-
</p>
<p>ner, who told them that a soldier had been killed
</p>
<p>in the ^voods, and their tribe charged with the
</p>
<p>crime. On hearing this, their fear revived, and
</p>
<p>with it their former purpose. Having collected
</p>
<p>their prisoners in a meadow, they surrounded the
</p>
<p>miserable wretches, armed with guns, war clubs,
</p>
<p>and bow^s and arrows, and prepared to put them to
</p>
<p>death. But another runner arrived before the
</p>
<p>butchery began, and, assuring them that what they
</p>
<p>had heard was false, prevailed on them once more
</p>
<p>to proceed. They pursued their journey without far-
</p>
<p>ther interruption, and, coming in safety to the camp,
</p>
<p>delivered the prisoners whom they had brought.
</p>
<p>These by no means included all of their cap-
</p>
<p>tives, for nearly a hundred were left behind,
</p>
<p>because they belonged to warriors who had gone
</p>
<p>to the Illinois to procure arms and ammunition
</p>
<p>from the French ; and there is no authority in an
</p>
<p>Indian community powerful enough to deprive the
</p>
<p>meanest warrior of his property, even in circum-
</p>
<p>stances of the greatest public exigency. This was
</p>
<p>clearly understood by the English commander, and
</p>
<p>he therefore received the submission of the Shaw-
</p>
<p>anoes, at the same time compelling them to deliver
</p>
<p>hostages for the future surrender of the remaining

</p>
<p>nti, Nov.] SPEECH OF THE INDIAN ORATOR. 225
</p>
<p>Band after band of captives had been daily arriv-
</p>
<p>ing, until upwards of two hundred were now
</p>
<p>collected in the camp ; including, as far as could
</p>
<p>be ascertained, all who had been in the hands of
</p>
<p>the Indians, excepting those belonging to the
</p>
<p>absent warriors of tlie Shawanoes. Up to this
</p>
<p>time, Bouquet had maintained a stern and rigorous
</p>
<p>demeanor ; repressing his natural clemency and
</p>
<p>humanity, refusing all friendly intercourse with
</p>
<p>the Indians, and telling them that he should treat
</p>
<p>them as enemies until they had fully complied with
</p>
<p>all the required conditions. In this, he displayed
</p>
<p>his knowledge of their character ; for, like all war-
</p>
<p>like savages, they are extremely prone to interpret
</p>
<p>lenity and moderation into timidity and indecision ;
</p>
<p>and he who, from good-nature or mistaken phi-
</p>
<p>lanthropy, is betrayed into yielding a point wliich
</p>
<p>he has before insisted on, may have deep cause to
</p>
<p>rue it. As their own dealings with their enemies
</p>
<p>are not leavened with such humanizing ingredients,
</p>
<p>they can seldom comprehend them ; and to win
</p>
<p>over an Indian foe by kindness should only be
</p>
<p>attempted by one who has already proved clearly
</p>
<p>that he is able and ready to subdue him by force.
</p>
<p>But now, when every condition Avas satisfied,
</p>
<p>?uch inexorable rigor was no longer demanded ;
</p>
<p>and, having convoked the chiefs in the sylvan coun
</p>
<p>cil-house, Bouquet signified his willingness to re-
</p>
<p>ceive their offers of peace.

</p>
<p>peace may once more descend to warm and gladden
</p>
<p>us. I wipe the tears from your eyes, and condole
</p>
<p>with you on the loss of your brethren who have
</p>
<p>perished in this war. I gather their bone;:
</p>
<p>together, and cover them deep in the earth, that
</p>
<p>the sight of them may no longer bring sorrow tc
</p>
<p>your hearts ; and I scatter dry leaves over the sf >ot
</p>
<p>that it may depart for ever from memory.
</p>
<p>" The path of peace, which once ran between
</p>
<p>your dwellings and mine, has of late been choked
</p>
<p>with thorns and briers, so that no one could pass
</p>
<p>that way ; and we have both almost forgotten that
</p>
<p>such a path had ever been. I now clear away all
</p>
<p>such obstructions, and make a broad, smooth road,
</p>
<p>so that you and I may freely visit each other, as
</p>
<p>our fathers used to do. I kindle a great council
</p>
<p>fire, whose smoke shall rise to heaven, in view of
</p>
<p>all the nations ; while you and I sit together and
</p>
<p>smoke the peace-pipe at its blaze." ^
</p>
<p>1 An Indian council, on solemn occasions, is always opened with pre-
</p>
<p>liminary forms, sufficiently wearisome and tedious, but made indispen-
</p>
<p>sable by immemorial custom ; for this people are as much bound by th( ir
</p>
<p>conventional usages as the most artificial children of civilization. The
</p>
<p>forms are varied to some extent, according to the imagination and taste of
</p>
<p>the speaker ; but in all essential respects they are closely similar, through
</p>
<p>out the tribes of Algonquin and Iroquois lineage. They run somewhat as
</p>
<p>follows, each sentence being pronounced with great solemnity, and con.
</p>
<p>firmed by the delivery of a wampum belt: Brothers, with this belt 1
</p>
<p>open your ears that you may hear  I remove grief and sorrow from your
</p>
<p>hearts  I draw from your feet the thorns which have pierced them as
</p>
<p>you journeyed thither  I clean the seats of the council-house, that you

<p>since we last met  I wipe out any blood which may have been spilt
</p>
<p>between us. This ceremony, which, by the delivery of so many belts of
</p>
<p>wampum, entailed no small expense, was never used except on the mosi
</p>
<p>Important occasions ; and at the councils with Colonel Bouquet the angry
</p>
<p>warriors seem wholly to have dispensed with it.
</p>
<p>w64, Nov.] REPLY OF BOUQUET. 221
</p>
<p>In this strain, the orator of each tribe, in turn,
</p>
<p>expressed the purpose of his people to lay down
</p>
<p>their arms, and live for the future in friendship
</p>
<p>with the English. Every deputation received a
</p>
<p>separate audience, and the successive conferences
</p>
<p>were thus extended through several days. To
</p>
<p>each and all. Bouquet made a similar reply, in
</p>
<p>i\ ords to the following effect : 
</p>
<p>" By your full compliance with the conditions
</p>
<p>which I imposed, you have satisfied me of your
</p>
<p>sincerity, and I now receive you once more as
</p>
<p>brethren. The King, my master, has commissioned
</p>
<p>me, not to make treaties for him, but to fight his
</p>
<p>battles ; and though I now offer you peace, it is
</p>
<p>not in my power to settle its precise terms and con-
</p>
<p>ditions. For this, I refer you to Sir William
</p>
<p>Johnson, his Majesty's agent and superintendent
</p>
<p>An Indian orator is provided with a stock of metaphors, which he
</p>
<p>always makes use of for the expression of certain ideas. Thus, to make
</p>
<p>war is to raise the hatchet ; to make peace is to take hold of the chain of
</p>
<p>friendship ; to dehberate is to kindle tlie council-fire ; to cover the bones
</p>
<p>of the dead is to make reparation and gain forgiveness for the act of kill-
</p>
<p>ing.thera. A state of war and disaster is typified by a black cloud ; a
</p>
<p>state of peace, by bright sunshine, or by an open path between the two
</p>
<p>nations.
</p>
<p>Tlie orator seldom speaks without careful premeditation of what he is
</p>
<p>about to say ; and his memory is refreshed by the belts of wampum,
</p>
<p>which he delivers after every clause in his harangue, as a pledge of the
</p>
<p>sincerity and truth of his words. These belts are carefully preserved by
</p>
<p>the hearers, as a substitute for written records ; a use for which they are
</p>
<p>the better adapted, as they are often worked with hieroglyphics express-
</p>
<p>ing the meaning they are designed to preserve. Thus, at a treaty of
</p>
<p>peace, the principal belt often bears the figures of an Indian and a whit

<p>man holding a chain between them.

<p>For the nature and uses of wampum, see note, ante, p. 186, note.
</p>
<p>Though a good memory is an essential qualification of an Indian or
</p>
<p>tor, it would be unjust not to observe that striking outbursts of soon
</p>
<p>taneoiis eloquence have sometimes proceeded from their lips.

</p>
<p>for Indian affairs, who will settle with you the arti
</p>
<p>cles of peace, and determine every thing in relation
</p>
<p>to trade. Two things, however, I shall insist on.
</p>
<p>And, first, you are to give hostages, as security
</p>
<p>that you will preserve good faith, and send, with
</p>
<p>out delay, a deputation of your chiefs to Sir Wil
</p>
<p>Ham Johnson. In the next place, these chiefs aie
</p>
<p>to be fully empowered to treat in behalf of your
</p>
<p>nation ; and you will bind yourselves to adhere
</p>
<p>strictly to every thing they shall agree upon in your
</p>
<p>behalf."
</p>
<p>These demands were readily complied with.
</p>
<p>Hostages were given, and chiefs appointed for
</p>
<p>the embassy ; and now, for the first time, Bou

<p>you. We, who are also warriors, will take hold as

<p>you do ; and we will think no more of war, in pity

</p>
<p>On this occasion, the Shawanoe chiefs, express-
</p>
<p>ing a hope for a renewal of the friendship which
</p>
<p>in former years had subsisted between their people
</p>
<p>and the English, displayed the dilapidated parch-
</p>
<p>ments of several treaties made between their
</p>
<p>ancestors and the descendants of William Penn, 
</p>
<p>documents, some of which had been preserved
</p>
<p>among them for more than half a century, with the
</p>
<p>scrupulous respect they are prone to exhibit for
</p>
<p>such ancestral records. They were told that, since
</p>
<p>they had not delivered all their prisoners, they
</p>
<p>could scarcely expect to meet the same indulgence
</p>
<p>which had been extended to their brethren ; but
</p>
<p>that, nevertheless, in full belief of their sincerity,

<p>the English would grant them peace, on condition

<p>of their promising to surrender the remaining cap-
</p>
<p>1 The Shawanoe speaker, in expressing his intention of disarming his
</p>
<p>enemy by laying aside his own designs of war, makes use of an unusual
</p>
<p>metaphor. To bury the hatchet is the figure in common use on sucli occa-
</p>
<p>sions, but he adopts a form of speech which he regards as more significant
</p>
<p>an 1 emphatic,  that of throwing it up to tlie Great Spirit. UnwilUng to
</p>
<p>confess that he yields through fear of the enemy, he professes to wish for
</p>
<p>peace merely for the sake of his women and children.

<p>At the great council at Lancaster, in 1762, a chief of the Oneidas,
</p>
<p>anxious to express, in the strongest terms, the firmness of the peace

<p>which had been concluded, had recourse to the following singular figure :
</p>
<p>" In the country of the Oneidas there is a great pine-tree, so huge and old

</p>
<p>six of their chiefs as hostages. These conditions
</p>
<p>were agreed to ; and it may be added that, at the
</p>
<p>appointed time, all the prisoners who had been
</p>
<p>left in their hands, to the number of a hundred)
</p>
<p>were brought in to Fort Pitt, and delivered up to

<p>the commanding officer.'
</p>
<p>From the hard formalities and rigid self-control
</p>
<p>of an Indian council-house, where the struggles of
</p>
<p>fear, rage, and hatred were deep buried beneath
</p>
<p>a surface of iron immobility, we turn to scenes of
</p>
<p>a widely different nature ; an exhibition of mingled
</p>
<p>and contrasted passions, more worthy the pen of
</p>
<p>the dramatist than that of the historian ; who,
</p>
<p>restricted to the meagre outline of recorded author-
</p>
<p>ity, can reflect but a feeble image of the truth. In
</p>
<p>the ranks of the Pennsylvania troops, and among
</p>
<p>the Virginia riflemen, were the fathers, brothers,
</p>
<p>and husbands of those whose rescue from captivity
</p>
<p>was a chief object of the march. Ignorant what
</p>
<p>had befallen them, and doubtful whether they were
</p>
<p>yet among the living, these men had joined the

<p>1 A party of the Virginia volunteers had been allowed by Bouquet to
</p>
<p>go to the remoter Shawanoe towns, in the hope of rescuing captive rela-
</p>
<p>tives. They returned to Fort Pitt at midwinter, bringing nine prisoners,
</p>
<p>ill cliildren or old women. The whole party was frost-bitten, and had
</p>
<p>endured the extremity of suffering on the way. They must have per-
</p>
<p>ished but for a Sliawanoe chief, named Benewisica, to whose care Bouquet

<p>hiid confided them, and who remained with them both going and return

</p>
<p>to home and civihzation. Perhaps those w^hom
</p>
<p>they sought had perished by the slow torments of
</p>
<p>the stake ; perhaps by the more merciful hatchet ;
</p>
<p>or perhaps they still dragged out a wretched life
</p>
<p>in the midst of a savage horde. There were in-
</p>
<p>stances in which whole families had been carried
</p>
<p>off at once. The old, the sick, or the despaking,
</p>
<p>had been tomahawked, as useless encumbrances ;
</p>
<p>while the rest, pitilessly forced asunder, w^ere scat-
</p>
<p>tered through every quarter of the wilderness. It
</p>
<p>was a strange and moving sight, when troop after
</p>
<p>troop of prisoners arriyed in succession - the
</p>
<p>meeting of husbands with wives, and fathers with
</p>
<p>children, the reunion of broken families, long sepa-

<p>moved. The roughest soldiers felt the contagious
</p>
<p>sympathy, and softened into unwonted tenderness.
</p>
<p>Among the children brought in for surrender,
</p>
<p>there were some, who, captured several years be-
</p>
<p>fore, as early, perhaps, as the French war, had lost
</p>
<p>every recollection of friends and home. Terrified
</p>
<p>by the novel sights around them, the flash and
</p>
<p>glitter of arms, and the strange complexion of the
</p>
<p>pale-faced warriors, they screamed and struggled
</p>
<p>lustily when consigned to the hands of their rela-
</p>
<p>tives. There were young women, too, who had
</p>
<p>become the partners of Indian husbands ; and who
</p>
<p>now, with all their hybrid off'spring, were led reluct-
</p>
<p>antly into the presence of fathers or brothers whose
</p>
<p>images were almost blotted from their memory.
</p>
<p>They stood agitated and bewildered ; the revival
</p>
<p>of old affections, and the rush of dormant memories,
</p>
<p>painfully contending with more recent attachments,
</p>
<p>and the shame of their real or fancied disgrace ;
</p>
<p>while their Indian lords looked on, scarcely less
</p>
<p>moved than they, yet hardening themselves with
</p>
<p>savage stoicism, and standing in the midst of their
</p>
<p>enemies, imperturbable as statues of bronze
</p>
<p>These women w^ere compelled to return with theii
</p>
<p>children to the settlements ; yet they all did so
</p>
<p>with reluctance, and several afterwards made their

</p>
<p>Day after day brought renewals of these scenes,
</p>
<p>deepening in interest as they drew towards theii
</p>
<p>close. A few individual incidents have been
</p>
<p>recorded. A young Virginian, robbed of his wife
</p>
<p>but a few months before, had volunteered in the
</p>
<p>expedition with the faint hope of recovering her ;
</p>
<p>and, after long suspense, had recognized her
</p>
<p>among a troop of prisoners, bearing in her arms
</p>
<p>a child born during her captivity. But the joy of
</p>
<p>the meeting was bitterly alloyed by the loss of a
</p>
<p>former child, not two years old, captured with the
</p>
<p>mother, but soon taken from her, and carried, she
</p>
<p>could not tell whither. Days passed on ; they
</p>
<p>could learn no tidings of its fate, and the mother,
</p>
<p>harrowed with terrible imaginations, was almost
</p>
<p>driven to despair; when, at length, she discovered
</p>
<p>her child in the arms of an Indian warrior, and
</p>
<p>unatched it with an irrepressible cry of transport.
</p>
<p>When the army, on its homeward march, reached
</p>
<p>the town of Carlisle, those who had been unable
</p>
<p>to follow the expedition came thither in numbers,
</p>
<p>to inquire for the friends they had lost. Among
</p>
<p>the rest was an old woman, whose daughter had
</p>
<p>been carried off nine years before. In the crowd
</p>
<p>of female captives, she discovered one in whose
</p>
<p>wild and swarthy features she discerned the altered
</p>
<p>lished in tlie Incidents of Border Warfare, and other similar collections.
</p>
<p>The autobiography of Mary Jemison, a woman captured by the Senecaa
</p>
<p>during the French war, and twice married among them, contains an
</p>
<p>instance of attachment to Indian life similar to those mentioned above.
</p>
<p>After the conclusion of hostilities, learning that she was to be given up to
</p>
<p>the whites in accordance with a treaty, she escaped into the woods with
</p>
<p>her half-breed children, and remained hidden, in great dismay and agita

<p>lineaments of her child ; but the girl, who had
</p>
<p>almost forgotten her native tongue, returned no
</p>
<p>sign of recognition to her eager words, and the old
</p>
<p>woman bitterly complained that the daughter,
</p>
<p>whom she had so often sung to sleep on her knee,
</p>
<p>had forgotten her in her old age. Bouquet sug-
</p>
<p>gested an expedient which proves him a man of
</p>
<p>feeling and perception. " Sing the song that you
</p>
<p>used to sing to her when a child." The old
</p>
<p>woman obeyed ; and a sudden start, a look of
</p>
<p>bewilderment, and a passionate flood of tears,
</p>
<p>removed every doubt, and restored the long-lost
</p>
<p>daughter to her mother's arms.^
</p>
<p>The tender affections by no means form a salient
</p>
<p>feature in the Indian character. They hold them
</p>
<p>in contempt, and scorn every manifestation of them ,
</p>
<p>yet, on this occasion, they would not be repressed,
</p>
<p>and the human heart betrayed itself, though throb-
</p>
<p>bing under a breastplate of ice. None of the
</p>
<p>ordinary signs of emotion, neither tears, w^ords,
</p>
<p>nor looks, declared how greatly they were moved.
</p>
<p>It was by their kindness and soUcitude, by their
</p>
<p>attention to the wants of the captives, by their
</p>
<p>offers of furs, garments, the choicest articles of
</p>
<p>food, and every thing which in their eyes seemed
</p>
<p>luxury, that they displayed their sorrow at parting
</p>
<p>from their adopted relatives and friends.^ Some

<p>among them went much farther, and asked permis-
</p>
<p>sion to follow the army on its homeward march ^
</p>
<p>that they might hunt for the captives, and supply
</p>
<p>them with better food than the military stores could
</p>
<p>furnish. A young Seneca warrior had become
</p>
<p>deeply enamoured of a Virginian girl. At great
</p>
<p>risk of his life, he accompanied the troops far
</p>
<p>within the limits of the settlements ; and, at every
</p>
<p>night's encampment, approaching the quarters of
</p>
<p>the captives as closely as the sentinels would per-
</p>
<p>mit, he sat watching, with patient vigilance, to
</p>
<p>catch a glimpse of his lost mistress.
</p>
<p>The Indian women, whom no idea of honor com
</p>
<p>pels to wear an iron mask, were far from emulating
</p>
<p>the frigid demeanor of their lords. All day they
</p>
<p>ran wailing through the camp ; and, when night
</p>
<p>came, the hills and woods resounded with t^eir
</p>
<p>dreary lamentations.^
</p>
<p>The word prisoner^ as applied to captives taken

<p>by the Indians, is a misnomer, and conveys a wholly

<p>false impression of their situation and treatment.

<p>two hundred voices joining in a discord as wild and dismal as the shriek

</p>
<p>survive their wrath with moderation and humanity ;
</p>
<p>often adopting them to supply the place of lost
</p>
<p>brothers, husbands, or children, whose names are
</p>
<p>given to the successors thus substituted in their
</p>
<p>place. 13y a formal ceremony, the white blood is
</p>
<p>washed from their veins ; and they are regarded
</p>
<p>thenceforth as members of the tribe, faring equally
</p>
<p>with the rest in prosperity or adversity, in famine
</p>
<p>or abundance. When children are adopted in this
</p>
<p>manner by Indian women, they nurture them with
</p>
<p>the same tenderness and indulgence which they
</p>
<p>extend, in a remarkable degree, to their own off-
</p>
<p>spring ; and such young women as will not marry
</p>
<p>an Indian husband are treated with a singular for-
</p>
<p>bearance, in which superstition, natural tempera-
</p>
<p>ment, and a sense of right and justice may all claim
</p>
<p>a share. ^ The captive, unless he excites suspicion

<p>by his conduct, or exhibits peculiar contumacy, is

<p>left with no other restraint than his own free will.
</p>
<p>The warrior who captured him, or to whom he was
</p>
<p>assigned in the division of the spoil, sometimes
</p>
<p>claims, it is true, a certain right of property in him.

<p>to the exclusion of others ; but this claim is soon

</p>
<p>desire to eifc.t it ; but, strange as it may appear,

<p>others, who, amid the general tumult of joy and
</p>
<p>sorrow, sat sullen and scowling, angry that they
</p>
<p>were forced to abandon the wild license of the
</p>
<p>forest for the irksome restraints of society.^ Thus
</p>
<p>to look back with a fond longing to inhospitable
</p>
<p>deserts, where men, beasts, and Nature herself,
</p>
<p>seem arrayed in arms, and where ease, security,
</p>
<p>and all that civilization reckons among the goods
</p>
<p>of life, are alike cut off, may appear to argue some
</p>
<p>strange perversity or moral malformation. Yet
</p>
<p>such has been the experience of many a sound
</p>
<p>and healthful mind. To him who has once tasted"
</p>
<p>the reckless independence, the haughty self-reliance,
</p>
<p>the sense of irresponsible freedom, which the forest"
</p>
<p>life engenders, civilization thenceforth seems flat
</p>
<p>and stale. Its pleasures are insipid, its pursuits
</p>
<p>wearisome, its conventionalities, duties, and mutual
</p>
<p>dependence alike tedious and disgusting. The
</p>
<p>entrapped wanderer grows fierce and restless, and
</p>
<p>pants for breathing-room. His path, it is true,
</p>
<p>mony of adoption. Hence it was that the warriors, in their desperation,
</p>
<p>formed tlie design of putting them to death, fearing that, in the attacK
</p>
<p>which they meditated, the captives would naturally take part with theiJ

</p>
<p>gladdening his heart with exulting self-confidence,
</p>
<p>and sending the blood through his veins with a

<p>livelier current. The wilderness, rough, harsh, and
</p>
<p>inexorable, has charms more potent in their seduc-
</p>
<p>tive influence than all the lures of luxury and
</p>
<p>sloth. And often he on whom it has cast its
</p>
<p>magic finds no heart to dissolve the spell, and
</p>
<p>remains a wanderer and an Ishmaelite to the hour
</p>
<p>of his death. ^

<p>1 Golden, after describing the Indian wars of 1699, 1700, concludes in
</p>
<p>the following words : 
</p>
<p>" I shall finish this Part by observing that notwithstanding the French
</p>
<p>Commissioners took all the Pains possible to carry Home the French
</p>
<p>that were Prisoners with the Five Nations, and they had full Liberty
</p>
<p>from the Indians, few of them could be persuaded to return. It may be
</p>
<p>thouglit that this was occasioned from the Hardships they had endured ic
</p>
<p>their own Country, under a tyrannical Government and a barren Soil.
</p>
<p>But this certainly was not the Keason, for the English had as much
</p>
<p>Difficulty to persuade tlie People that had been taken Prisoners by the
</p>
<p>French Indians to leave the Indian Manner of living, thougli no People
</p>
<p>enjoy more Liberty, and live in greater Plenty than tlie common Inhabi-
</p>
<p>lants of New York do. No Arguments, no Intreaties, nor Tears of their
</p>
<p>Friends and Pelations, could persuade many of them to leave their new
</p>
<p>Indian Friends and Acquaintance. Several of them that were by the
</p>
<p>Caressings of their Relations persuaded to come Home, in a little Time
</p>
<p>grew tired of our Manner of living, and ran away to the Indians, and
</p>
<p>ended their Days with them. On the other Hand, Indian Children have

<p>of another sort, strongest with minds of the finest

<p>over those who neither acknowledge nor suspect
</p>

<p>waves of verdure. To the sick, the weaned, or
</p>
<p>the sated spirit, nature opens a theatre of boundless
</p>
<p>life, and liolds forth a cup brimming with redundant
</p>
<p>pleasure. In the other joys of existence, fear is
</p>
<p>balanced against hope, and satiety against delight ;
</p>
<p>but here one may fearlessly drink, gaining, with
</p>
<p>every draught, new vigor and a heightened zest,
</p>
<p>and finding no dregs of bitterness at the bottom.
</p>
<p>Having accomplished its work, the army left
</p>
<p>the Muskingum, and, retracing its former course,
</p>
<p>arrived at Fort Pitt on the twenty-eighth of No-
</p>
<p>vember. The recovered captives were sent to their
</p>
<p>respective homes in Pennsylvania or Virginia ; and
</p>
<p>the provincial troops disbanded, not without w^arm
</p>
<p>praises for the hardihood and steadiness with which
</p>
<p>they had met the difficulties of the campaign. The
</p>
<p>happy issue of the expedition spread joy through-
</p>
<p>out the country. At the next session of the Penn-
</p>
<p>sylvania Assembly, one of its first acts was to pass
</p>
<p>a vote of thanks to Colonel Bouquet, expressing in
</p>
<p>earnest terms its sense of his services and per-
</p>
<p>sonal merits, and conveying its acknowledgments
</p>
<p>for the regard which he had constantly shown to
</p>
<p>the civil rights of the inhabitants.^ The Assembly
</p>
<p>of Virginia passed a similar vote ; and both houses
</p>
<p>concurred in recommending Bouquet to the King
</p>
<p>^ for promotion.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, his position was far from being an
</p>
<p>easy or a pleasant one. It may be remembered
</p>
<p>that the desertion of his newly levied soldiers had
</p>
<p>forced him to ask Colonel Lewis to raise for him

<p>one or two companies of Virginian yolunteers
</p>
<p>Virginia, which had profited by the campaign,
</p>
<p>though contributing nothing to it, refused to pay
</p>
<p>these troops ; and its agents tried to throw the
</p>
<p>burden upon Bouquet in person. The Assembly
</p>
<p>of Pennsylvania, with a justice and a generosity
</p>
<p>which went far to redeem the past, came to bis
</p>
<p>relief and assumed the debt, though not till he
</p>
<p>had suffered the most serious annoyance. Certain
</p>
<p>recent military regulations contributed at the same
</p>
<p>time to increase his vexation and his difficulties.
</p>
<p>He had asked in vain, the year before, to be re
</p>
<p>lieved from his command. He now asked again,
</p>
<p>and the request was granted ; on which he wrote to
</p>
<p>Gage : '' The disgust I have conceived from the ilU
</p>
<p>nature and ingratitude of those individuals {the
</p>
<p>Virginian officials) makes me accept with great sati
</p>
<p>isfaction your obliging offer to discharge me of thii
</p>
<p>department, in which I never desire to serve again^
</p>
<p>nor, indeed, to be commanding officer in any other,
</p>
<p>since the new regulations you were pleased to com-
</p>
<p>municate to me ; being sensible of my inability to
</p>
<p>carry on the service upon the terms prescribed." ^
</p>
<p>He was preparing to return to Europe, when he
</p>
<p>received the announcement of his promotion to the
</p>
<p>rank of Brigadier General. He was taken com-
</p>
<p>pletely by surprise ; for he had supposed that the
</p>
<p>rigid prescriptions of the service had closed the
</p>
<p>path of advancement against him, as a foreigner,
</p>
<p>" I had, to-day," he wrote to Gage, " the honor of

</p>
<p>The unexpected honor, whicli his Majesty has
</p>
<p>condescended to confer upon me, fills my heart with
</p>
<p>the utmost gratitude. Permit me, sir, to express my
</p>
<p>sincere acknowledgments of my great obligation
</p>
<p>to you. . . . The flattering prospect of preferment,
</p>
<p>open to the other foreign officers by the removal
</p>
<p>of that dreadful barrier, gives me the highest satis-
</p>
<p>faction, being convinced that his Majesty has no
</p>
<p>subjects more devoted to his service.'' ^
</p>
<p>Among the letters of congratulation which he
</p>
<p>received from officers serving under him is the
</p>
<p>following, from Captain George Etherington, of
</p>
<p>the first battalion of the Royal American regiment,

<p>who commanded at Michillimackinac when it was

<p>*' Sir :
</p>
<p>Though I almost despair of this reaching you
</p>
<p>before you sail for Europe, yet I cannot deny myself
</p>
<p>the pleasure of giving you joy on your promotion,
</p>
<p>and can with truth tell you that it gives great joy

<p>to all the gentlemen of the battalion, for two rea-
</p>
<p>sons : first, on your account ; and, secondly, on our
</p>
<p>own, as by that means we may hope for the pleas-
</p>
<p>ure of continuing under your command.

<p>" You can hardly imagine how this place rings
</p>
<p>with the news of your promotion, for tlie towns-
</p>
<p>men and boors (i.e., German farmers) stop us in

<p>are told it is true, they march off with great joy ;

<p>SO you see the old proverb wrong for once, which
</p>
<p>says, he that prospers is, envied; for sure I am
</p>
<p>that all the people here are more pleased with the
</p>
<p>news of your promotion than they would be if the

</p>
<p>''Brigadier Genkral Henry Bouqxjet."
</p>
<p>" And," concludes Dr. William Smith, the chron-
</p>
<p>icler of the campaign, '' as he is rendered as dear
</p>
<p>by his private virtues to those who have the honor
</p>
<p>of his more intimate acquaintance, as he is by his
</p>
<p>military services to the public, it is hoped he may
</p>
<p>long continue among us, where his experienced
</p>
<p>abilities will enable him, and his love of the Eng
</p>
<p>lish constitution entitle him, to fill any future trust
</p>
<p>to which his Majesty may be pleased to call him."
</p>
<p>This hope was not destined to fulfilment. Bouquet
</p>
<p>was assigned to the command of the southern mil -
</p>
<p>itary department; and, within three years after his
</p>
<p>return from the Muskingum, he was attacked with
</p>
<p>a fever at Pensacola, which closed the career of a

<p>gallant soldier and a generous man.

<p>The Delawares and Shawanoes, mindful of their

<p>engagement and of the hostages which they had

<p>given to keep it, sent their deputies, within the

<p>appointed time, to Sir William Johnson, who con

<p>CHAPTER XXVin.
</p>
<p>1764.
</p>
<p>THE ILLINOIS.
</p>
<p>We turn to a region of which, as yet, we have
</p>
<p>caught but transient glimpses ; a region which to
</p>
<p>our forefathers seemed remote and strange, as to
</p>
<p>us the mountain strongholds of the Apaches, or the
</p>
<p>wastes of farthest Oregon. The country of the Illi-
</p>
<p>nois was chiefly embraced within the boundaries
</p>
<p>of the state which now retains the name. Thither-
</p>
<p>ward, from the east, the west, and the north, three
</p>
<p>mighty rivers rolled their tiibutary waters ; while
</p>
<p>countless smaller streams  small only in compar-
</p>
<p>ison  traversed the land with a watery network,
</p>
<p>impregnating the warm soil with exuberant fecun-
</p>
<p>dit}\ From the eastward, the Ohio  La Belle
</p>
<p>Riviere  pursued its windings for more than a
</p>
<p>thousand miles. The Mississippi descended from
</p>
<p>the distant north ; while from its fountains in the
</p>
<p>westj three thousand miles away, the Missouri
</p>
<p>poured its torrent towards the same common cen-
</p>
<p>tre. Born among mountains, trackless even now,

</p>
<p>cries of savages, never silent in that wilderness, 
</p>
<p>it holds its angry course through sun-scorched
</p>
<p>deserts, among towers and palaces, the architecture
</p>
<p>of no human hand, among lodges of barbarian
</p>
<p>hordes, and herds of bison blackening the prairie
</p>
<p>to the horizon. Fierce, reckless, headstrong, ex-
</p>
<p>ulting in its tumultuous force, it plays a thousand
</p>
<p>freaks of wanton power ; bearing away forests
</p>
<p>from its shores, and planting them, wdth roots up-
</p>
<p>permost, in its quicksands ; sweeping off islands,
</p>
<p>and rebuilding them ; frothing and raging in foam
</p>
<p>and Avhirlpool, and, again, gliding with dwindled
</p>
<p>current along its sandy channel. At length, dark
</p>
<p>with uncurbed fury, it pours its muddy tide into
</p>
<p>the reluctant Mississippi. That majestic river,
</p>
<p>drawing life from the pure fountains of the north,
</p>
<p>wandering among emerald' prairies and wood-
</p>
<p>crowned bluffs, loses all its earlier charm with
</p>
<p>this unhallowed union. At first, it shrinks as
</p>
<p>with repugnance ; and along the same channel
</p>
<p>the two streams flow side by side, with unmingled
</p>
<p>waters. But the disturbing power prevails at
</p>
<p>length ; and the united torrent bears onward in its
</p>
<p>might, boiling up from the bottom, whirling in
</p>
<p>many a vortex, flooding its shores with a malign
</p>
<p>deluge fraught with pestilence and fever, and
</p>
<p>burying forests in its depths, to insnare the heed
</p>
<p>less voyager. Mightiest among rivers, it is the
</p>
<p>connecting link of adverse climates and contrasted
</p>
<p>races ; and, while at its northern source the fur-

<p>along its banks, and the panting negro cools his
</p>
<p>limbs in its refreshing waters.
</p>
<p>To these great rivers and their tributary streams
</p>
<p>the country of the Illinois owed its wealth, its
</p>
<p>grassy prairies, and the stately woods that flour-
</p>
<p>ished on its deep, rich soil. This prolific land
</p>
<p>teemed with life. It was a hunter's paradise
</p>
<p>Deer grazed on its meadows. The elk trooped in
</p>
<p>herds, like squadrons of cavalry. In the still
</p>
<p>morning, one might hear the clatter of their ant-
</p>
<p>lers for half a mile over the dewy prairie. Count-
</p>
<p>less bison roamed the plains, filing in grave
</p>
<p>procession to drink at the rivers, plunging and
</p>
<p>snorting among the rapids and quicksands, rolling
</p>
<p>their huge bulk on the grass, rushing upon eaci:
</p>
<p>other in hot encounter, like champions under shield
</p>
<p>The wildcat glared from the thicket; the racooL
</p>
<p>thrust his furry countenance from the hollow tree,
</p>
<p>and the opossum swung, head downwards, from the
</p>
<p>overhanging bough.
</p>
<p>With the opening spring, when the forests are
</p>
<p>budding into leaf, and the prairies gemmed with
</p>
<p>flowers ; when a warm, faint haze rests upon the
</p>
<p>landscape,  then heart and senses are inthralled
</p>
<p>witli luxurious beauty. The shrubs and wild fruit-
</p>
<p>trees, flushed with pale red blossoms, and the small
</p>
<p>clustering flowers of grape-vines, which choke the
</p>
<p>gigantic trees with Laocoon wnthings, fill the
</p>
<p>forest with their rich perfume. A few days later,
</p>
<p>and a cloud of verdure overshadows the land ; while
</p>
<p>birds innumerable sing beneath its canopy, and

<p>248 THE ILLINOIS. [1764
</p>
<p>Yefc this western paradise is not free from the
</p>
<p>primal curse. The beneficent sun, which kindles
</p>
<p>hito life so many forms of loveliness and beauty,
</p>
<p>fails not to engender venom and death from the
</p>
<p>rank slime of pestilential swamp and marsh. In
</p>
<p>some stagnant pool, buried in the jungle- like
</p>
<p>depths of the forest, where the hot and lifeless
</p>
<p>water reeks with exhalations, the water- snake
</p>
<p>basks by the margin, or winds his checkered
</p>
<p>length of loathsome beauty across the sleepy sur-
</p>
<p>face. From beneath the rotten carcass of some
</p>
<p>fallen tree, the moccason thrusts out his broad flat
</p>
<p>head, ready to dart on the intruder. On the dry,
</p>
<p>sun-scorched prairie, the rattlesnake, a more gen-
</p>
<p>erous enemy, reposes in his spiral coil. He scorns
</p>
<p>to shun the eye of day, as if conscious of the
</p>
<p>honor accorded to his name by the warlike race,
</p>
<p>who, jointly with him, claim lordship over the
</p>
<p>land.* But some intrusive footstep awakes him
</p>
<p>I The superstitious veneration which the Indians entertain for the
</p>
<p>rattlesnake has been before alluded to. The Cherokees christened him
</p>
<p>by a name which, being interpreted, signifies the bright old inhabitantn, a
</p>
<p>title of affectionate admiration of which his less partial acquaintance
</p>
<p>would hardly judge him worthy.
</p>
<p>" Between the heads of the northern branch of the Lower Cheerake
</p>
<p>River, and the heads of that of Tuckaschchee, winding round in a long
</p>
<p>course by the late Fort Loudon, and afterwards into the Mississippi, there
</p>
<p>is, both in the nature and circumstances, a great phenomenon. Between
</p>
<p>tTTO high mountains, nearly covered with old mossy rocks, lofty cedars
</p>
<p>and pines, in the valleys of which the beams of the sun reflect a powerful
</p>
<p>heat, there are, as the natives affirm, some bright old inhabitants, or
</p>
<p>rattlesnakes, of a more enormous size than is mentioned in history.
</p>

</p>
<p>crown, here toiled and suffered, with a self-sacrific-

<p>ing devotion which extorts a tribute of admiration
</p>
<p>even from sectarian bigotry. While the colder

<p>apostles of Protestantism labored upon the out-

<p>their own transient and futile labors. Morning and

</p>
<p>Virgin, and knelt in supplication before the shrine
</p>
<p>of St. Joseph.^
</p>
<p>Soldiers and fur-traders followed where these
</p>
<p>pioneers of the church had led the way. Forts

<p>were built here and there throughout the country,
</p>
<p>and the cabins of settlers clustered about the mis-

<p>sion houses. The new colonists, emigrants from

<p>Canada or disbanded soldiers of French regiments,
</p>
<p>bore a close resemblance to the settlers of Detroit,

<p>or the primitive people of Acadia ; whose simple

<p>the injunction to increase and multiply ; and the

<p>colony languished in spite of the fertile soil. The

<p>people labored long enough to gain a bare subsist-
</p>
<p>ence for each passing day, and spent the rest of
</p>
<p>their time in dancing and merry-making, smoking,

<p>gossiping, and hunting. Their native gayety was
</p>
<p>irrepressible, and they found means to stimulate it
</p>
<p>with wine made from the fruit of the wild grape-

<p>vines. Thus they passed their days, at peace with

<p>right of appeal. Yet his power was exercised in

<p>a patriarchal spirit, and he usually commanded the

<p>respect and confidence of the people. Many years
</p>
<p>later, when, after the War of the E^evolution, the

<p>Illinois came under the jurisdiction of the United

<p>intolerable burden of self-government, and to be

<p>once more subjected to a military commandant.^

<p>The Creole is as unchanging in his nature and

<p>were about eighty houses at Kaskaskia, forty or

<p>fifty at Cahokia, a few at Vincennes and Fori

<p>Chartres, and a few more scattered in small clus-

<p>them, marked with many weaknesses, and many
</p>
<p>amiable virtues; but their morals were not im-
</p>

</p>
<p>reckless, harebrained adventurers, who, happily for

<p>the peace of their relatives, were absent on their

</p>
<p>would have proved an intolerable annoyance. But
</p>
<p>the easy-tempered Creoles made friends and com-
</p>
<p>rades of them ; ate, drank, smoked, and often
</p>
<p>married witli them. They were a debauched and
</p>
<p>drunken rabble, the remnants of tliat branch of
</p>
<p>the Algonquin stock known among the French as
</p>
<p>the Ilhnois, a people once numerous and powerful,
</p>
<p>but now miserably enfeebled, and corrupted by
</p>
<p>foi'eign wars, domestic dissensions, and their own
</p>
<p>licentious manners. They comprised the broken
</p>
<p>fragments of five tribes,  the Kaskaskias, Caho-
</p>
<p>kins, Peorias, Mitchigamias, and Tamaronas. Some
</p>
<p>of their villages were in the close vicinity of the
</p>
<p>CiMjole settlements. On a hot summer morning,
</p>
<p>they might be seen lounging about the trading-
</p>
<p>house, basking in the sun, begging for a dram of
</p>
<p>eriej ; any one wlio lias had any dealings with them must plainly see
</p>
<p>that they are for the most part transported Convicts, or people who have
</p>
<p>fled for some crimes ; tliose who have not done it themselves are the
</p>
<p>oflspdng of such as those I just mentioned, inheriting their Forefathers
</p>
<p>vices.. They are cruel and treacherous to each other, and consequently
</p>
<p>so to Strangers ; they are dishonest in every kind of business and lay
</p>
<p>themselves out to overreach Strangers, which they often do by a lew
</p>
<p>cunmng, peculiar to themselves; and their artful flatteries, with extrava-

<p>Of the traders, he says, " They are in general most unconscious

<p>{unconscionable) Kascals, whose interest it was to debauch from us such
</p>
<p>Indians as they found well disposed towards us, and to foment and increace
</p>
<p>the animosity of such as they found otherwise. To this we should alone

<p>impute our late war with the Indians."

<p>PONTIAC RALLIES THE WESTERN TRIBES.
</p>
<p>When, by the treaty of Paris, in 1763, France
</p>
<p>ceded to England her territories east of the
</p>
<p>Mississippi, the IlHnois was of conrse included
</p>
<p>in the cession. Scarcely were the articles signed,
</p>
<p>when France, as if eager to rob herself, at one
</p>
<p>stroke, of all her western domam, threw away
</p>
<p>upon Spain the vast and indefinite regions beyond
</p>
<p>the Mississippi, destined at a later day to return to
</p>
<p>her hands, and finally to swell the growing empire
</p>
<p>of the United States. This transfer to Spain was
</p>
<p>for some time kept secret ; but orders were im-
</p>
<p>mediately sent to the officers commanding at the
</p>
<p>French posts within the territory ceded to England,
</p>
<p>to evacuate the country whenever British troops
</p>
<p>should appear to occupy it. These orders reached
</p>
<p>the Illinois towards the close of 1763. Some time,
</p>
<p>however, must necessarily elapse before the English
</p>
<p>could take possession ; for the Indian war was then

<p>at its height, and the country was protected from

</p>
<p>The colonists, hating the English with a more
</p>
<p>than national hatred, deeply imbittered by years of
</p>
<p>disastrous war, received the news of the treaty wdth
</p>
<p>disgust and execration. Many of them left the
</p>
<p>country, loath to dwell under the shadow of the
</p>
<p>British flag. Of these, some crossed the Missis
</p>
<p>Bippi to the little hamlet of St. Genevieve, on the
</p>
<p>western bank ; others followed the commandant,
</p>
<p>Neyon de Villiers, to New Orleans ; while others,
</p>
<p>taking wdth them all their possessions, even to the
</p>
<p>frames and clapboarding of their houses, passed
</p>
<p>the river a little above Cahokia, and established
</p>
<p>themselves at a beautiful spot on the opposite
</p>
<p>shore, where a settlement was just then on the
</p>
<p>point of commencement. Here a line of richly
</p>
<p>wooded bluffs rose with easy ascent from the mar-
</p>
<p>gin of the water ; while from their summits extended
</p>
<p>a wide plateau of fertile prairie, bordered by a
</p>
<p>framework of forest. In the shadow of the trees,
</p>
<p>which fringed the edge of the declivity, stood a
</p>
<p>newly built storehouse, with a few slight cabins
</p>
<p>and w^orks of defence, belonging to a company
</p>
<p>of fur-traders. At their head was Pierre Laclede,
</p>
<p>who had left New Orleans w^ith his followers in
</p>
<p>August, 1763 ; and, after toiling for three months
</p>
<p>against the impetuous stream of the Mississippi,
</p>
<p>had reached the Illinois in November, and selected
</p>
<p>the spot alluded to as the site of his first establish-
</p>
<p>ment. To this he gave the name of St. Louis. ^

</p>
<p>endowed with a vigor and elasticity of frame which
</p>
<p>could resist heat or cold, fatigue, hunger, or the

<p>could outmatch the waking realities which were in

<p>rise upon the vision of Pierre Chouteau. Wheie

<p>in his youth, he had climbed the woody bluff, and
</p>
<p>looked abroad on prairies dotted with bison, he saw,
</p>
<p>with the dim eye of his old age, the land darkened
</p>
<p>for many a furlong with the clustered roofs of the ,
</p>
<p>western metropolis. For the silence of the wilder-
</p>
<p>ness, he heard the clang and turmoil of human
</p>
<p>labor, the din of congregated thousands ; and
</p>
<p>where the great river rolled down through the
</p>
<p>forest, in lonely grandeur, he saw the waters
</p>
<p>lashed into foam beneath the prows of panting
</p>
<p>steamboats, flocking to the broad levee. ^

</p>
<p>grand fur-trading enterprise to a conclusion ; but his young assistant lived

<p>trapper, and voyageur, from the frontier of the United States to the Rocky
</p>
<p>Mountains, and from the British Possessions to the borders of New

<p>Mexico, the nanie of Pierre Chouteau is familiar as his own. I visited
</p>
<p>this venerable man in the spring of 1846, at his country seat, in a rural

<p>spot surrounded by woods, within a few miles of St. Louis. The build'

<p>tlie Mississippi Valley, with its broad eaves and light verandas, and the
</p>
<p>surrounding negro houses filled with gay and contented inmates, was in
</p>
<p>singular harmony with the character of the patriarchal owner, who prided
</p>
<p>himself on his fidelity to the old French usages. Though in extreme
</p>

<p>tioned. St. Ange de Bellerive remained behind to
</p>
<p>succeed him. St. Ange was a veteran Canadian
</p>
<p>officer, the same who, more than forty years before,
</p>
<p>had escorted Father Charlevoix through the coun
</p>
<p>tiy, and who is spoken of with high commendation
</p>
<p>by the Jesuit traveller and historian. He took
</p>
<p>command of about forty men, the remnant of the
</p>
<p>garrison of Fort Chartres ; which, remote as it was,
</p>
<p>was then esteemed one of the best constructed mil-
</p>
<p>itary works in America. Its ramparts of stone,
</p>
<p>garnished with twenty cannon, scowled across the
</p>
<p>encroaching Mississippi, destined, before many
</p>
<p>years, to ingulf curtain and bastion in its ravenous
</p>
<p>abyss.
</p>
<p>St. Ange's position was by no means an enviable
</p>
<p>one. He had a critical part to play. On the one
</p>
<p>hand, he had been advised of the cession to the
</p>
<p>English, and ordered to yield up the country when-
</p>
<p>ever they should arrive to claim it. On the other,
</p>
<p>he was beset by embassies from Pontiac, from the
</p>
<p>Shawanoes, and from the Miamis, and plagued day
</p>
<p>and night by an importunate mob of Illinois Indians,
</p>
<p>demanding arms, ammunition, and assistance against
</p>
<p>the common enemy. Perhaps, in his secret heart,
</p>
<p>St. xAnge would have rejoiced to see the scalps of
</p>
<p>all the Englishmen in the backwoods fluttering in
</p>
<p>the wind over the Illinois wigwams ; but his situa-

</p>
<p>his intrusive petitioners, and it is to be hoped thai
</p>
<p>some sense of honor and humanity enforced the dic-
</p>
<p>tates of prudence. Accordingly, he cajoled them
</p>
<p>with flatteries and promises, and from time to time
</p>
<p>distributed a few presents to stay their importunity,
</p>
<p>Btill praying daily that the English might appear
</p>
<p>and relieve him from his uneasy dilemma.*
</p>
<p>While Laclede was founding St. Louis, while the
</p>
<p>discontented settlers of the Illinois were deserting
</p>
<p>their homes, and while St. Ange was laboring to
</p>
<p>pacify his Indian neighbors, all the tribes from the
</p>
<p>Maumee to the Mississippi were in a turmoil of
</p>
<p>excitement. Pontiac was among them, furious as
</p>
<p>a wild beast at bay. By the double campaign of
</p>
<p>1764, his best hopes had been crushed to the earth ;
</p>
<p>but he stood unshaken amidst the ruin, and stil!
</p>
<p>struggled with desperate energy to retrieve his
</p>
<p>broken cause. On the side of the northern lakes,
</p>
<p>the movements of Bradstreet had put down the
</p>
<p>insurrection of the tribes, and wrested back the
</p>
<p>military posts which cunning and treachery had
</p>
<p>placed within their grasp. In the south. Bouquet
</p>
<p>had forced to abject submission the warlike Dela-
</p>
<p>wares and Shawanoes, the warriors on whose cour-
</p>
<p>age and obstinacy Pontiac had grounded his strongest
</p>
<p>confidence. On every hand defeat and disaster were
</p>
<p>closing around him. One sanctuary alone remained,
</p>
<p>the country of the Illinois. Here the flag of France
</p>
<p>still floated on the banks of the Mississippi, and

<p>here no English foot had dared to penetrate. He

<p>1 By the following extract from an official paper, signed by Captain

<p>Grant, and forwarded from Detroit, it appears that Pontiac still retained,
</p>
<p>or professed to retain, his original designs against the garrison of Detroit.
</p>
<p>The paper has no date, but was apparently written in the autumn of
</p>
<p>1764. By a note appended to it, we are told that the Baptiste Carnpau
</p>
<p>referred to was one of those who had acted as Pontiac's secretaries during
</p>
<p>the summer of 1763 : 
</p>
<p>"On Tuesday last Mr. Jadeau told me, in the presence of Col. Gladwin

<p>tlement of Detroit), & signed by Pontiac, from the Illinois, setting forth
</p>
<p>that there were five hundred English coming to the Illinois, & that they,
</p>
<p>the Ottawas, must have patience ; that he, Pontiac, was not to return until
</p>
<p>he had defeated the English, and then he would come with an army from
</p>
<p>the Illinois to take Detroit, which he desired they might publish to all
</p>
<p>the nations about. That powder & ball was in as great plenty as water.

<p>The Diary of the Siege of Detroit, under date May 17, 1765, says that
</p>
<p>Pontiac's nephew came that day from the Illinois, with news that Pontiac
</p>
<p>had caused six Englishmen and several disaffected Indians to be burned;
</p>
<p>and that he had seven large war-belts to raise the western tribes for
</p>
<p>another attack on Detroit, to be made 11 June of that year, withoul
</p>
<p>French assistance.

</p>
<p>Now that the insuiTection in the east was quelled,
</p>
<p>and the Delawares and Shawanoes were beaten into
</p>
<p>submission, it was thought that the English would
</p>
<p>lose no time in taking full possession of the country,
</p>
<p>which, by the peace of 1763, had been transferred
</p>
<p>into their hands. Two principal routes would give
</p>
<p>access to the Illinois. Troops might advance from
</p>
<p>the south up the great natural highway of the
</p>
<p>Mississippi, or they might descend from the east
</p>
<p>by way of Fort Pitt and the Ohio. In either case,
</p>
<p>to meet and repel them was the determined purpose
</p>
<p>of Pontiac.
</p>
<p>In the spring, or early summer, he had come to
</p>
<p>the Illinois and visited the commandant, Neyon,
</p>
<p>who was then still at his post. Neyon's greeting
</p>
<p>was inauspicious. He told his visitor that he
</p>
<p>hoped he had returned at last to his senses. Pon-
</p>
<p>tiac laid before him a large belt of wampum.
</p>
<p>"My Father," he said, "I come to invite you and
</p>
<p>all your allies to go .with me to war against the
</p>
<p>English." Neyon asked if he had not received his
</p>
<p>message of the last autumn, in which he told him
</p>
<p>that the French and English were thenceforth one
</p>
<p>people ; but Pontiac persisted, and still urged him
</p>
<p>tc take up the hatchet. Neyon at length grew
</p>
<p>angry, kicked away the wampum-belt, and de-
</p>
<p>manded if he could not hear what was said to him.
</p>
<p>Thus repulsed, Pontiac asked for a keg of rum.
</p>
<p>Which being given him, he caused to be carried
</p>
<p>to a neighboring Illinois village ; and, with the help
</p>
<p>of this potent auxiliary, made the assembled war
</p>
<p>riors join him in the war-song.*

</p>
<p>It does not appear that, on this occasion, he had
</p>
<p>any farther success in firing the hearts of the Illi-
</p>
<p>nois. He presently returned to his camp on the
</p>
<p>Maumee, where, by a succession of ill-tidings, be
</p>
<p>learned the humihation of his allies, and the tri
</p>
<p>uniph of his enemies. Towards the close of
</p>
<p>nutumn, he again left the Maumee ; and, followed
</p>
<p>by four hundred warriors, journeyed westward, to
</p>
<p>visit in succession the different tribes, and gain their
</p>
<p>co-operation in his plans of final defence. Cross-
</p>
<p>ing over to the Wabash, he passed from village to
</p>
<p>village, among the Kickapoos, the Piankishaws,
</p>
<p>and the three tribes of the Miamis, rousing them
</p>
<p>by his imperious eloquence, and breathing into
</p>
<p>them his own fierce spirit of resistance. Thence,
</p>
<p>by rapid marches through forests and over prairies,
</p>
<p>he reached the banks of the Mississippi, and sum-
</p>
<p>moned the four tribes of the Illinois to a genera)
</p>
<p>meeting. But these degenerate savages, beaten by
</p>
<p>the surrounding tribes for many a generation past,
</p>
<p>had lost their warlike spirit ; and, th^mgh abun-
</p>
<p>dantly noisy and boastful, showed no zeal for fight,
</p>
<p>and entered with no zest into the schemes of the
</p>
<p>Ottawa war-chief Pontiac had his own way of
</p>
<p>dealing with such spirits. " If you hesitate," he
</p>
<p>exclaimed, frowning on the cowering .assembly, " I
</p>
<p>will consume your tribes as the fire ronsumes the
</p>
<p>dry grass on the prairie." The doubts of the Illi-
</p>
<p>nois vanished like the mist, and with marvellous
</p>
<p>alacrity they declared their concurrence in the
</p>
<p>views of the orator. Having secured these allies,
</p>
<p>such as they were, Pontiac departed, and hastened

<p>1764.J HE VISITS ST. ANGE 265
</p>
<p>with embassy after embassy, and mob after mob,
</p>
<p>thought that the crowning evil was come at last,
</p>
<p>when he saw the arch-demon Pontiac enter at the
</p>
<p>gate, with four hundred warriors at his back,
</p>
<p>xlrrived at the council-house, Pontiac addressed the
</p>
<p>commandant in a tone of great courtesy : " Father,
</p>
<p>we have long wished to see you, to shake hands
</p>
<p>with you, and, whilst smoking the calumet of
</p>
<p>peace, to recall the battles in which we fought
</p>
<p>together against the misguided Indians and the
</p>
<p>English dogs. I love the French, and I have come
</p>
<p>hither with my warriors to avenge their wrongs." '
</p>
<p>Then followed a demand for arms, ammunition, and
</p>
<p>troops, to act in concert with the Indian warriors.
</p>
<p>St. Ange was forced to decline rendering the
</p>
<p>expected aid; but he sweetened his denial with
</p>
<p>soothing compliments, and added a few gifts, to
</p>
<p>remove any lingering bitterness. Pontiac would
</p>
<p>not be appeased. He angrily complained of such
</p>
<p>lukewarm friendship, where he had looked for
</p>
<p>ready sympathy and support. His warriors pitched
</p>
<p>their lodges about the fort, and threatening symp-
</p>
<p>toms of an approaching rupture began to alarm
</p>
<p>the French.
</p>
<p>In the mean time, Pontiac had caused his squaws

<p>to construct a belt of wampum of extraordinary
</p>
<p>size, six feet in length, and four inches wide. It

<p>ber, still leagued together in his alliance.^ He
</p>
<p>consigned it to an embassy of chosen warriors,
</p>
<p>directing them to carry it down the Mississippi,
</p>
<p>displaying it, in turn, at every Indian village along
</p>
<p>its banks; and exhorting the mhabitants, in his
</p>
<p>name, to watch the movements of the English, and
</p>
<p>repel any attempt they might make to ascend the
</p>
<p>river. This done, they were to repair to New
</p>
<p>Orleans, and demand from the governor, M. D'x\b-
</p>
<p>badie, the aid which St. Ange had refused. The
</p>
<p>bark canoes of the embassy put out from the shore,
</p>
<p>and whirled down the current like floating leave?
</p>
<p>in autumn.
</p>
<p>Soon after their departure, tidings came to Fort
</p>
<p>Chartres, which caused a joyous excitement among
</p>
<p>the Indians, and relieved the French garrison from
</p>
<p>any danger of an immediate rupture. In our own
</p>
<p>day, the vast distance between the great city of
</p>
<p>New Orleans and the populous state of Illinois has
</p>
<p>dwindled into insignificance beneath the magic of
</p>
<p>science ; but at the date of this history, three or
</p>
<p>four months were often consumed in the upward
</p>
<p>passage, and the settlers of the lonely forest colony
</p>
<p>were sometimes cut off from all communication
</p>
<p>v^dth the world for half a year together. The above-
</p>
<p>mentioned tidings, interesting as they were, had
</p>
<p>occupied no less time in their passage. Theii

<p>import was as follows :

</p>
<p>to ascend the Mississippi, to take possession of
</p>
<p>Fort Chartres and its dependent posts. His troops
</p>
<p>were embarked in large and heavy boats. Their
</p>
<p>progress was slow ; and they had reached a point
</p>
<p>not more than eighty leagues above New Orleans,
</p>
<p>when, one morning, their ears were greeted with
</p>
<p>the crack of rifles from the thickets of the western
</p>
<p>shore ; and a soldier in the foremost boat fell, with
</p>
<p>a mortal wound. The troops, in dismay, sheered
</p>
<p>over towards the eastern shore ; but, when fairly
</p>
<p>within gunshot, a score of rifles obscured the forest
</p>
<p>edge with smoke, and, filled the nearest boat with
</p>
<p>dead and wounded men. On this, they steered for
</p>
<p>the middle of the river, where they remained for
</p>
<p>a time, exposed to a dropping fire from either bank,
</p>
<p>too distant to take efi'ect.
</p>
<p>The river was high, and the shores so flooded,
</p>
<p>that nothing but an Indian could hope to find
</p>
<p>foothold in the miry labyrinth. Loftus was terri-
</p>
<p>fied ; the troops were discouraged, and a council
</p>
<p>of ofiicers determined that to advance was impos-
</p>
<p>sible. Accordingly, with their best despatch, they
</p>
<p>steered back for New Orleans, where they arrived
</p>
<p>without farther accident ; and where the French,
</p>
<p>in great glee at their discomfiture, spared no ridi-
</p>
<p>cule at their expense. They alleged, and with
</p>
<p>much appearance of truth, that the English had
</p>
<p>been repulsed by no more than thirty warriors.
</p>
<p>Loftus charged D'Abbadie with having occasioned
</p>
<p>his disaster by stirring up the Indians to attack
</p>
<p>him. The governor called Heaven to witness his

</p>
<p>reason to believe him guilty of such villany.* Lof-
</p>
<p>tus, who had not yet recovered from his fears,
</p>
<p>conceived an idea that the Indians below New
</p>
<p>Orleans were preparing an ambuscade to attack
</p>
<p>him on his way back to his station at Pensacola ;
</p>
<p>and he petitioned D'iVbbadie to interfere in his
</p>
<p>behalf. The latter, with an ill-dissembled sneer,
</p>
<p>offered to give him and his troops an escort of
</p>
<p>French soldiers to protect them. Loftus rejected
</p>
<p>the humiliating proposal, and declared that he
</p>
<p>only wished for a French interpreter, to confer with
</p>
<p>any Indians whom he might meet by the way.
</p>
<p>The interpreter was furnished ; and Loftus returned
</p>
<p>in safety to Pensacola, his detachment not a little
</p>
<p>reduced by the few whom the Indians had shot,
</p>
<p>and by numbers who, disgusted by his overbearing
</p>
<p>treatment, had deserted to the French.^
</p>
<p>The futile attempt of Loftus to ascend the Mis
</p>
<p>sissippi was followed, a few months after, by another
</p>
<p>equally abortive. Captain Pittman came to New
</p>
<p>Orleans with the design of proceeding to the Illi-
</p>
<p>nois, but was deterred by the reports which reached
</p>
<p>1 D'Abbadie's correspondence with St. Ange goes far to exonerate
</p>
<p>him ; and there is a letter addressed to him from General Gage, in which
</p>
<p>the latter thanks him very cordially for the efforts he had made in
</p>
<p>behalf of Major Loftus, aiding him to procure boats and guides, and make
</p>
<p>other preparations for ascending the river.
</p>
<p>The correspondence alluded to forms part of a collection of pa[>cr8
</p>
<p>preserved in the archives of the Department of the Marine and Colonies
</p>
<p>at Paris. These papers include the reports of various councils with the
</p>
<p>Indian tribes of the Illinois, and the whole official correspondence of the
</p>
<p>French officers in that region during the years 1763-5. They form the
</p>

</p>
<p>latter, elated beyond measure by their success
</p>
<p>against Loftus, and excited, moreover, by the mes-
</p>
<p>sages and war-belt of Pontiac, were in a state of
</p>
<p>angry commotion, which made the passage too
</p>
<p>hazardous to be attempted. Pittman bethought
</p>
<p>himself of assuming the disguise of a Frenchman,
</p>
<p>joining a party of Creole traders, and thus reach-
</p>
<p>ing his destination by stealth ; but, weighing the
</p>
<p>risk of detection, he abandoned this design also,
</p>
<p>and returned to Mobile.^ Between the Illinois
</p>
<p>and the settlements around New Orleans, the Mis-
</p>
<p>sissippi extended its enormous length through
</p>
<p>solitudes of marsh and forest, broken here and
</p>
<p>there by a squalid Indian village ; or, at vast inter-
</p>
<p>vals, by one or two military posts, erected by the
</p>
<p>French, and forming the resting-places of the voy-
</p>
<p>ager. After the failure of Pittman, more than a
</p>
<p>year elapsed before an English detachment could
</p>
<p>succeed in passing this great thoroughfare of the
</p>
<p>wilderness, and running the gauntlet of the savage
</p>
<p>tribes who guarded its shores. It was not till the

</p>
<p>the head of a strong body of troops, arrived, after

<p>in the autumn of 1764, faithfully acquitted them-
</p>
<p>selves of their trust. They visited the Indian vil-
</p>
<p>lages along the river banks, kindling the thirst for
</p>
<p>blood and massacre in the breasts of the inmates.
</p>
<p>They pushed their sanguinary mission even to the
</p>
<p>farthest tribes of Southern Louisiana, to whom the
</p>
<p>great name of Pontiac had long been known, and
</p>
<p>of late made famiUar by repeated messages and
</p>
<p>embassies.^ This portion of their task accom
</p>
<p>plished, they repaired to New Orleans, and demanded
</p>
<p>an audience of the governor.
</p>
<p>New Orleans was then a town of about seven
</p>
<p>thousand white inhabitants, guarded from the river
</p>
<p>floods by a levee extending for fifty miles along
</p>
<p>the banks. The small brick houses, one story in
</p>
<p>height, were arranged with geometrical symmetry,
</p>
<p>like the squares of a chess-board. Each house
</p>
<p>had its yard and garden, and the town was enliv-
</p>
<p>ened with the verdure of trees and grass. In front,
</p>
<p>a public square, or parade ground, opened upon
</p>
<p>the river, enclosed on three sides by the dilapi-
</p>
<p>dated church of St. Louis, a prison, a convent,
</p>
<p>government buildings, and a range of barracks
</p>
<p>The place was surrounded by a defence of pali-
</p>
<p>sades strong enough to repel an attack of Indians,
</p>
<p>or insurgent slaves.^
</p>
<p>By the correspondence between the French officers of Upper and
</p>
<p>Lower Louisiana, it appears that Pontiac's messengers, in several instances,
</p>
<p>had arrived in the vicinity of New Orleans, whither they had come, partly
</p>
<p>to beg for aid from the French, and partly to urge the Indians of the
</p>
<p>adjacent country to bar the mouth of the Mississippi against the English.

</p>
<p>When Pontiac's ambassadors entered New Or-
</p>
<p>leans, they found the town in a state of confu-
</p>
<p>sion It had long been known that the regions
</p>
<p>east of the Mississippi had been surrendered to
</p>
<p>England ; a cession from which, however, New
</p>
<p>Orleans and its suburbs had been excepted by a
</p>
<p>special provision. But it was only within a few
</p>
<p>weeks that the dismayed inhabitants had learned
</p>
<p>that their mother country had transferred her
</p>
<p>remaining American possessions to the crown of
</p>
<p>Spain, whose government and people they cordially
</p>
<p>detested. With every day they might expect the
</p>
<p>arrival of a Spanish governor and garrison. The
</p>
<p>French officials, whose hour was drawing to its
</p>
<p>close, were making the best of their short-lived
</p>
<p>authority by every species of corruption and
</p>
<p>peculation ; and the inhabitants were awaiting, in
</p>
<p>anger and repugnance, the approaching change,
</p>
<p>which w^as to place over their heads masters whom
</p>
<p>they hated. The governor, D'Abbadie, an ardent
</p>
<p>soldier and a zealous patriot, was so deeply cha-
</p>
<p>grined at what he conceived to be the disgrace of
</p>
<p>his country, that his feeble health gave way, and
</p>
<p>he betrayed all the symptoms of a rapid decline.
</p>
<p>Haggard with illness, and bowed down with
</p>
<p>shame, the dying cjovernor received the Indiar
</p>
<p>envoys in the council-hall of the province, where
</p>
<p>he was never again to assume his seat of office.
</p>
<p>Besides the French officials in attendance, several

<p>English officers, who chanced to be in the town,

<p>A Shawanoe chief, the orator of the embassy, dis
</p>
<p>played the great war-belt, and opened the council.
</p>
<p>" These red dogs," he said, alluding to the color of
</p>
<p>the British uniform, " have crowded upon us more
</p>
<p>and more ; and when we ask them by what right
</p>
<p>they come, they tell us that you, our French
</p>
<p>fathers, have given them our lands. We know
</p>
<p>that they lie. These lands are neither yours nor
</p>
<p>theirs, and no man shall give or sell them without
</p>
<p>our consent. Fathers, we have always been your
</p>
<p>faithful children ; and we now have come to ask
</p>
<p>that you will give us guns, powder, and lead, to
</p>
<p>aid us in this war."
</p>
<p>D'Abbadie replied in a feeble voice, endeavoring
</p>
<p>to allay their vindictive jealousy of the English,
</p>
<p>and promising to give them all that should be nee
</p>
<p>essary to supply their immediate wants. The coun-
</p>
<p>cil then adjourned until the following day ; but, in
</p>
<p>the mean time, the wasted strength of the gover-
</p>
<p>nor gave way beneath a renewed attack of his
</p>
<p>disorder ; and, before the appointed hour arrived,
</p>
<p>he had breathed his last, hurried to a premature
</p>
<p>death by the anguish of mortified pride and
</p>
<p>patriotism. M. Aubry, his successor, presided
</p>
<p>in his place, and received the savage embassy.
</p>
<p>The orator, after the solemn custom of his people,
</p>
<p>addressed him in a speech of condolence, express

<p>ing his deep regret for D'Abbadie's untimely fate.^
</p>
<p>I At all friendly meetings with Indians, it was customary for the
</p>
<p>latter, when the other party had sustained any signal loss, to commence
</p>
<p>by a formal speech of condolence, offering, at the same time, a black belt
</p>
<p>of "^ampum, in token of mourning. This practice may be particularly

</p>
<p>A chief of the Miamis then rose to speak, with a

<p>scowling brow, and words of bitterness and re
</p>
<p>proach. " Since we last sat on these seats, our
</p>
<p>ears have heard strange words. When the Eng-
</p>
<p>lish told us that they had conquered you, we
</p>
<p>always thought that they lied ; but now we have
</p>
<p>learned that they spoke the truth. We have
</p>
<p>learned that you, whom we have loved and served
</p>
<p>so well, have given the lands that we dwell upon
</p>
<p>to your enemies and ^ours. We have learned that
</p>
<p>the English have forbidden you to send traders to
</p>
<p>our villages to supply our wants ; and that you,
</p>
<p>whom we thought so great and brave, have obeyed
</p>
<p>their commands like women, leaving us to starve
</p>
<p>and die in misery. We now tell you, once for all,
</p>
<p>that our lands are our own ; and we tell you, more-
</p>
<p>Dver, that we can live without your aid, and hunt,
</p>
<p>and fish, and fight, as our fathers did before us.
</p>
<p>All that we ask of you is this : that you give us
</p>
<p>back the guns, the powder, the hatchets, and the
</p>
<p>knives which we have worn out in fighting your
</p>
<p>battles. As for you," he exclaimed, turning to the
</p>
<p>English officers, who were present as on the pre-
</p>
<p>ceding day,  " as for you, our hearts burn with
</p>
<p>rage when we think of the ruin you have brought
</p>
<p>on us." Aubry returned but a weak answer to the
</p>
<p>cutting attack of the Indian speaker. He assured
</p>
<p>the ambassadors that the French still retained their
</p>
<p>former love for the Indians, that the English meant
</p>
<p>them no harm, and that, as all the world were now

</p>
<p>RUIN OF THE INDIAN CAUSE.
</p>
<p>The repulse of Tioftus, and rumors of the fierce
</p>
<p>temper of the Indians who guarded the Mississippi,
</p>
<p>convinced the commander-in-chief that to reach the
</p>
<p>Illinois by the southern route was an enterprise of
</p>
<p>no easy accomplishment. Yet, at the same time,
</p>
<p>he felt the strong necessity of a speedy military
</p>
<p>occupation of the country ; since, while the jieur
</p>
<p>de lis floated over a single garrison in the ceded
</p>
<p>territory, it would be impossible to disabuse the
</p>
<p>Indians of the phantom hope of French assistance,
</p>
<p>to which they clung with infatuated tenacity. The
</p>
<p>embers of the Indian war would never be quenched
</p>
<p>until England had enforced all her claims over her
</p>
<p>defeated rival. Gage determined to despatch a
</p>
<p>force from the eastward, by way of Fort Pitt and
</p>
<p>the Ohio ; a route now laid open by the late suc-
</p>
<p>cess of Bouquet, and the submission of the Dela-
</p>
<p>wares and Shawanoes.
</p>
<p>To prepare a way for the passage of the troops,
</p>
<p>Sir William Johnson's deputy, George Croghan,

<p>was ordered to proceed in advance, to reason with

</p>
<p>the Indians as far as they were capable of reason
</p>
<p>ing ; to soften then* antipathy to the English, to
</p>
<p>expose the falsehoods of the French, and to distrib-
</p>
<p>ute presents among the tribes by way of propitia-
</p>
<p>tion.^ The mission was a critical one ; but, so far
</p>
<p>as regarded the Indians, Croghan was well fitted to
</p>
<p>discharge it. He had been for years a tradei
</p>
<p>among the western tribes, over whom he had
</p>
<p>gained much influence by a certain vigor of char
</p>
<p>acter, joined to a wary and sagacious policy, con
</p>
<p>cealed beneath a bkifl" demeanor. Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Fraser, a young officer of education and intelli-
</p>
<p>gence, was associated with him. He spoke French,
</p>
<p>and, in other respects also, supplied qualifications
</p>
<p>in which his rugged colleague was wanting. They
</p>
<p>set out for Fort Pitt in February, 1765 ; and after
</p>
<p>traversing inhospitable mountains, and valleys
</p>
<p>clogged with snow, reached their destination at
</p>
<p>about the same time that Pontiac's ambassadors
</p>
<p>were entering New Orleans, to hold their council
</p>
<p>with the French.
</p>
<p>A few days later, an incident occurred, which
</p>
<p>afterwards, through the carousals of many a winter
</p>
<p>evening, supplied an absorbing topic of anecdote
</p>
<p>and boast to the braggadocio heroes of the border.
</p>
<p>A train of pack-horses, bearing the gifts which
</p>
<p>Croghan was to bestow upon the Indians, followed
</p>
<p>him towards Fort Pitt, a few days' journey in the
</p>
<p>rear of his party. Under the same escort came
</p>
<p>several companies of traders, who, believing that
</p>
<p>the long suspended commerce with the Indians was

<p>about to be reopened, were bastening to Fort Pitt
</p>
<p>witb a great quantity of goods, eager to tbrow tbem
</p>
<p>into the market the moment the prohibition should
</p>
<p>be removed. There is reason to believe that Cro-
</p>
<p>ghan had an interest in these goods, and that,
</p>
<p>under pretence of giving presents, he meant to
</p>
<p>open a clandestine trade. ^ The Paxton men, and
</p>
<p>their kindred spirits of the border, saw the proceed-
</p>
<p>ing with sinister eyes. In their view, the traders
</p>
<p>were about to make a barter of the blood of the
</p>
<p>people ; to place in the hands of murdering sav-
</p>
<p>ages the means of renewing the devastation to
</p>
<p>which the reeking frontier bore frightful witness.
</p>
<p>Once possessed with this idea, they troubled them-
</p>
<p>selves with no more inquiries ; and, having tried
</p>
<p>remonstrances in vain, they adopted a summary
</p>
<p>mode of doing themselves justice. At the head of
</p>
<p>the enterprise was a man whose name had been
</p>
<p>connected with more praiseworthy exploits, James
</p>
<p>Smith, already mentioned as leading a party of
</p>
<p>independent riflemen, for the defence of the bor-
</p>
<p>ders, during the bloody autumn of 1763. He now
</p>
<p>mustered his old associates, made them resume
</p>
<p>their Indian disguise, and led them to their work
</p>
<p>with characteristic energy and address.
</p>
<p>The government agents and traders were in the
</p>
<p>act of passing the verge of the frontiers. Their
</p>
<p>united trains amounted to seventy pack-horses,

</p>
<p>leave to ask whether Croghan had such extensive orders."  Bouquet o

</p>
<p>eleven thousand, were waiting transportation at
</p>
<p>Fort Loudon. Advancing deeper among the moun-
</p>
<p>tains, they hegan to descend the valley at the foot
</p>
<p>of Sidling Hill. The laden horses plodded knee-
</p>
<p>deep in snow. The mountains towered above the
</p>
<p>wayfarers in gray desolation ; and the leafless for-
</p>
<p>est, a mighty ^^olian harp, howled dreary music to
</p>
<p>the wind of March. Suddenly, from behind snow-

<p>beplastered trunks and shaggy bushes of evergreen,
</p>
<p>uncouth apparitions started into view. Wild vis-
</p>
<p>ages protruded, grotesquely horrible with vermilion
</p>
<p>and ochre, white lead and soot; stalwart limbs
</p>
<p>appeared, encased in buckskin ; and rusty rifles
</p>
<p>thrust out their long muzzles. In front, and flank,
</p>
<p>and all around them, white puffs of smoke and
</p>
<p>sharp reports assailed the bewildered senses of the
</p>
<p>travellers, who were yet more confounded by the
</p>
<p>hum of bullets shot by unerring fingers within an
</p>
<p>inch of their ears. " Gentlemen," demanded the
</p>
<p>traders, in deprecating accents, " what would you
</p>

</p>
<p>voice from the woods, " pile your goods in the road,

<p>and be off." The traders knew those with whom
</p>
<p>they had to deal. Hastening to obey the mandate,
</p>
<p>they departed with their utmost speed, happy that
</p>
<p>their scalps were not numbered with the booty.

</p>
<p>the cause of justice, despatched a party of soldiers,
</p>
<p>seized several innocent persons, and lodged them
</p>
<p>in the guard-house.^ In high dudgeon at such an
</p>
<p>infraction of their liberties, the borderers sent mes-
</p>
<p>sengers through the country, calling upon all good
</p>
<p>men to rise in arms. Three hundred obeyed the
</p>
<p>summons, and pitched their camp on a hill oppo-

<p>site Fort Loudon ; a rare muster of desperadoes,
</p>
<p>yet observing a certain moderation in their wildest
</p>
<p>acts, and never at a loss for a plausible reason to
</p>
<p>justify any pranks which it might please them to
</p>
<p>exhibit. By some means, they contrived to waylay

<p>and capture a considerable number of the garrison,
</p>
<p>on which the commandant condescended to send
</p>
<p>them a flag of truce, and offer an exchange of pris-
</p>
<p>oners. Their object thus accomplished, and their
</p>
<p>imprisoned comrades restored to them, the border-
</p>
<p>ers dispersed for the present to their homes. Soon

<p>after, however, upon the occurrence of some fresh

<p>difficulty, the commandant, afraid or unable to
</p>
<p>apprehend the misdoers, endeavored to deprive
</p>
<p>them of the power of mischief by sending soldiers

<p>to their houses and carrying off their rifles. His

<p>triumph was short ; for, as he rode out one after-

<p>280 RUIN OF THE INDIAN CAUSE. [1765
</p>
<p>Portable captivity until the rifles were restored
</p>
<p>From this time forward, ruptures were repeatedly
</p>
<p>occurring between the troops and the frontiersmen ;
</p>
<p>and the Pennsylvania border retained its turbulent
</p>
<p>character until the outbreak of the Revolutionary
</p>
<p>War.*
</p>
<p>* The account of the seizure of the Indian goods is derived chiefly
</p>
<p>from the narrative of the ringleader, Smith, pubhshed in Drake's Trage-
</p>
<p>dies of the Wilderness, and elsewhere. The correspondence of Gage and
</p>
<p>Johnson is filled with allusions to this affair, and the subsequent proceed-
</p>
<p>ings of the freebooters. Gage spares no invectives against vfhat he calU
</p>
<p>the lici ntious conduct of the frontier people. In the narrative is inserted
</p>
<p>a ballad, or lyrical effusion, written by some partisan of the frontier fac-
</p>
<p>tion, and evidently regarded by Smith as a signal triumph of the poetic
</p>
<p>art. He is careful to inform the reader that the author received his
</p>
<p>education in the great city of Dublin. The following melodious stanzas
</p>
<p>*mbody the chief action of the piece : 
</p>
<p>"Astonished at the wild design,
</p>
<p>Frontier inhabitants combin'd
</p>
<p>AVith brave so ids to stop their career;
</p>
<p>Although some men apostatiz'd,
</p>
<p>Who first the grand attempt ad%as'd,
</p>
<p>The bold fi'oiitiers they bravely stood,
</p>
<p>To act for their king and their country's good.
</p>
<p>In joint league, and strangers to fear.
</p>
<p>*' On March the fifth, in sixty-five,
</p>
<p>The Indian presents did arrive,
</p>
<p>In long pomp and cavalcade,
</p>
<p>Near Sidelong Hill, where in disguise
</p>
<p>Some patriots did their train surprise,
</p>
<p>And quick as lightning tumbled their loads,
</p>
<p>And kindled them bonfires in the woods.
</p>
<p>And mostly burnt their whole brigade."

<p>The following is an extract from Johnson's letter to the Board of
</p>
<p>Trade, dated July 10, 1765 : 
</p>
<p>"I have great cause to think that Mr. Croghan will succeed in hia
</p>
<p>enterprise, unless circumvented by tlie artificet^ of the French, or through
</p>
<p>the late licentious conduct of our own people. Although His Excellency
</p>
<p>General Gage has written tc the Ministry on that subject, yet I think I
</p>
<p>should not be silent thereupon, as it may be productive of very serioui
</p>
<p>consequences.
</p>
<p>I766.I CKOGHAN AT FORT PITT 281
</p>
<p>Whatever may have been Croghan's real attitude
</p>
<p>11 this affair, the border robbers had wrought great
</p>
<p>hijury to his mission ; since the agency most potent
</p>
<p>to gain the affections of an Indian had been com
</p>
<p>pletely paralyzed in the destruction of the presents.
</p>
<p>Croghan found means, however, partially to repair
</p>
<p>his loss from the storehouse of Fort Pitt, where
</p>
<p>tlie rigor of the season and the great depth of the
</p>
<p>snow forced him to remain several weeks. This
</p>
<p>cause alone would have served to detain him ; but
</p>
<p>he was yet farther retarded by the necessity of
</p>
<p>holding a meeting with the Delawares and Shaw-
</p>
<p>anoes, along whose southern borders he would be
</p>
<p>compelled to pass. An important object of the
</p>
<p>proposed meeting was to urge these tribes to fulfil
</p>
<p>the promise they had made, during the previous
</p>
<p>" The frontier inhabitants of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia,
</p>
<p>after having attacked and destroyed the goods which were going to Port
</p>
<p>Pitt (as in my last), did form themselves into parties, threatening to
</p>
<p>destroy all Indians they met, or all white people who dealt with them.
</p>
<p>They likewise marched to Fort Augusta, and from thence over the West
</p>
<p>branch of the Susquehanna, beyond tlie Bounds of the last purchase made
</p>
<p>by the Proprietaries, where they declare they will form a settlement, in
</p>
<p>defiance of Whites or Indians. They afterwards attacked a small party
</p>
<p>of Kis INIajesty's troops upon the Road, but were happily obliged to retire
</p>
<p>with the loss of one or two men. However, from their conduct and
</p>
<p>threats since, there is reason to think they will not stop here. Neither ii
</p>
<p>their licentiousness confined to the Provinces I have mentioned, the peo-
</p>
<p>ple of Carolina having cut otF a party, coming down under a pass from
</p>
<p>Col. Lewis, of the particulars of which your Lordships have been doubtlesi
</p>
<p>Informed.

<p>autumn, to Colonel Bouquet, to yield up their
</p>
<p>remaining prisoners, and send deputies to treat of
</p>
<p>peace with Sir William Johnson ; engagements
</p>
<p>which, when Croghan arrived at the fort, were as
</p>
<p>yet unfulfilled, though, as already mentioned, tlipy
</p>
<p>were soon after complied with.
</p>
<p>Immediately on his arrival, he had despatched
</p>
<p>messengers inviting the chiefs to a council ; a sum*
</p>
<p>mens which they obeyed with their usual reluctance
</p>
<p>and delay, dropping in, band after band, with such
</p>
<p>tardiness that a month was consumed before a suffi-
</p>
<p>cient number were assembled. Croghan then ad-
</p>
<p>dressed them, showing the advantages of peace, and
</p>
<p>the peril which they would bring on their own heads
</p>
<p>by a renewal of the w^ar ; and urging them to stand
</p>
<p>true to their engagements, and send their deputies
</p>
<p>to Johnson as soon as the melting of the snows
</p>
<p>should leave the forest pathways open. Several
</p>
<p>replies J all of a pacific nature, were made by the
</p>
<p>principal chiefs ; but the most remarkable person-
</p>
<p>age who appeared at the council was the Delaware
</p>
<p>prophet mentioned in an early portion of the nar-
</p>
<p>rative, as having been strongly instrumental in
</p>
<p>urging the tribes to war by means of pretended or
</p>
<p>imaginary revelations from the Great Spirit.^ He
</p>
<p>now delivered a speech by no means remarkable
</p>
<p>for elo(j[uence, yet of most beneficial consequence ;
</p>
<p>fiu' he intimated that the Great Spirit had not only
</p>
<p>revoked his sanguinary mandates, but had com-
</p>
<p>manded the Indians to lay down the hatchet, and

<p>smoke the pipe of peace.^ In spite of this auspi-
</p>
<p>cious declaration, and in spite of the chastisement
</p>
<p>and humiliation of the previous autumn, Croghan
</p>
<p>was privately informed that a large party among the
</p>
<p>Indians still remained balanced between their anger
</p>
<p>and their fears ; eager to take up the hatchet, yet
</p>
<p>dreading the consequences which the act might
</p>
<p>bring. Under this cloudy aspect of affairs, he was
</p>
<p>doubly gratified when a party of Sha^^ anoe warriors
</p>
<p>arrived, bringing with them the prisoners whom
</p>
<p>they had promised Colonel Bouquet to surrender ;
</p>
<p>and this faithful adherence to their word, contrary
</p>
<p>alike to Croghan's expectations, and to the proph-
</p>
<p>ecies of those best versed in Indian character, made
</p>
<p>it apparent that, whatever might be the sentiments
</p>
<p>of the turbulent among them, the more infiuentia]
</p>
<p>portion were determined on a pacific attitude.
</p>
<p>These councils, and the j^revious dela}s, con
</p>
<p>sumed so much time, that Croghan became fearful
</p>
<p>that the tribes of the Illinois might, meanwhile,
</p>
<p>commit themselves by some rash outbreak, which
</p>
<p>would increase the difficulty of reconciliation. In
</p>
<p>view of this danger, his colleague. Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Eraser, volunteered to proceed in advance, leaving
</p>
<p>Croghan to follow when he had settled affairs
</p>
<p>at Fort Pitt. Fraser departed, accordingly, with
</p>
<p>a few attendants. The rigor of the season had

<p>now begun to relent, and the ice-locked Ohio was

<p>canoe, and aided by the current, Fraser floated
</p>
<p>prosperously downwards for a thousand miles, and
</p>
<p>landed safely in the country of the Illinois. Here
</p>
<p>he found the Indians in great destitution, and hi a
</p>
<p>frame of mind which would have inclined them to
</p>
<p>peace but for the secret encouragement they received
</p>
<p>from the French. A change, however, soon took
</p>
<p>place. Boats arrived from New Orleans, loaded
</p>
<p>with a great quantity of goods, which the French,
</p>
<p>at that place, being about to abandon it, had sent
</p>
<p>in haste to the Illinois. The traders' shops at
</p>
<p>Kaskaskia were suddenly filled again. The Indi-
</p>
<p>ans were delighted ; and the French, with a view
</p>
<p>to a prompt market for their guns, hatchets, and
</p>
<p>gunpowder, redoubled their incitements to war.
</p>
<p>Fraser found himself in a hornet's nest. His life
</p>
<p>was in great danger ; but Pontiac, who was then
</p>
<p>at Kaskaskia, several times interposed to save him.
</p>
<p>The French traders picked a quarrel with him, and
</p>
<p>instigated the Indians to kill him ; for it was their
</p>
<p>interest that the war should go on. A party of
</p>
<p>them invited Pontiac to dinner ; plied him with
</p>
<p>whiskey ; and, having made him drunk, incited
</p>
<p>him to have Fraser and his servant seized. They
</p>
<p>were brought to the house where the debauch was
</p>
<p>going on ; and here, among a crowd of drunken
</p>
<p>Indians, their lives hung by a hair. Fraser writes,
</p>
<p>" He (Pontiac) and his men fought all night about
</p>
<p>us. They said we would get off next day if they
</p>
<p>should not prevent our flight by killing us. This
</p>
<p>Pontiac would not do. All night they did nothing

</p>
<p>I, with the help of an Indian who was sober,
</p>
<p>defended ourselves till morning, when they thought
</p>
<p>proper to let us escape. When Pontiac was sober,
</p>
<p>he made me an apology for his behavior ; and told
</p>
<p>me it was owing to bad counsel he had got that he
</p>
<p>had taken me ; but that I need not fear being
</p>
<p>taken in that manner for the future." ^
</p>
<p>Fraser's situation was presently somewhat im
</p>
<p>proved by a rumor that an English detachment
</p>
<p>was about to descend the Ohio. The French
</p>
<p>traders, before so busy with their falsehoods and
</p>
<p>calumnies, now held their peace, dreading the
</p>
<p>impending chastisement. They no longer gave
</p>
<p>arms and ammunition to the Indians ; and when
</p>
<p>the latter questioned them concerning the fabrica-
</p>
<p>tion of a French army advancing to the rescue,
</p>
<p>they treated the story as unfounded, or sought to
</p>
<p>evade the subject. St. Ange, too, and the other
</p>
<p>officers of the crown, confiding in the arrival of
</p>
<p>the English, assumed a more decisive tone ; refus-
</p>
<p>ing to give the Indians presents, telling them that
</p>
<p>thenceforward they must trust to the English for
</p>
<p>supplies, reproving them for their designs against
</p>
<p>the latter, and advising them to remain at peace.^
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Fraser's position was neither safe
</p>
<p>nor pleasant. He could hear nothing of Cioghan,
</p>
<p>and he was almost alone, having sent away all his
</p>
<p>men, except his servant, to save them from being
</p>
<p>abused and beaten by the Indians. He had dis-

<p>cretionary orders to go down to Mobile and report
</p>
<p>to the English commandant there ; and of these
</p>
<p>he was but too glad to avail himself. He descended
</p>
<p>the Mississippi in disguise, and safely reached New
</p>
<p>Orleans.*
</p>
<p>Apparently, it was about this time that an inci
</p>
<p>dent took place, mentioned, with evident satisfac-
</p>
<p>tion, in a letter of the French commandant, Aubry.
</p>
<p>The English officers in the south, unable to send
</p>
<p>troops up the Mississippi, had employed a French-
</p>
<p>man, whom they had secured in their interest, to
</p>
<p>ascend the river with a boat-load of goods, which
</p>
<p>h(. was directed to distribute among the Indians,
</p>
<p>to remove their prejudice against the English and
</p>
<p>pave the way to reconciliation. Intelligence of
</p>
<p>this movement reached the ears of Pontiac, who,
</p>
<p>though much pleased with the approaching sup-
</p>
<p>plies, had no mind that they should be devoted to
</p>
<p>1 MS. Letter  Auhrij to the Minister, July, 1765. Aubry makes him-
</p>
<p>self merry with the fears of Fraser ; who, however, had the best grounds
</p>
<p>for his appreliensions, as is sufficiently clear from the above as well as from
</p>
<p>the minutes of a council held by him witli Pontiac and other Indians at
</p>
<p>the Illinois, during the month of April. The minutes referred to are
</p>
<p>among the Paris Documents.
</p>
<p>Pontiac's first reception of Fraser was not auspicious, as appears from
</p>
<p>the following. Extract from a Letter  For/ Pitt, July 24 {Pa. Gaz. Nos.
</p>
<p>1912, 1913) : 
</p>
<p>" Pondiac immediately collected all the Indians under his influence to
</p>
<p>the Illinois, and ordered the French commanding officer there to deliver
</p>
<p>up these Englishmen [Fraser and his party] to him, as he liad prepared a
</p>
<p>largo kettle in which he was determined to boil them and all other Eng-
</p>
<p>lishmen that came that way. . . . Pondiac told the French that he had
</p>
<p>been informed of Mr. Croghan's coming that way to treat with the Indians,

</p>
<p>and that he would keep his kettle boiling over a large fire to receive him
</p>
<p>likewise."
</p>
<p>Pontiac soon after relented as we have seen. Another letter, dalod NeH
</p>
<p>Orleans, June 19, adds : " He [Fraser] says Pondiac is a very clever fello"^
</p>
<p>iind had it not been for him he would never ha* a got away alive."

</p>
<p>serve the interests of his enemies. He descended
</p>
<p>to the river bank with a body of his warriors ; and
</p>
<p>as La Garantais, the Frenchman, landed, he seized
</p>
<p>him and his men, flogged them severely, robbed
</p>
<p>them of their cargo, and distributed the goods
</p>
<p>with exemplary impartiality among his delighted
</p>
<p>followers.^
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this good fortune, Pontiac daily
</p>
<p>saw his followers dropping off from their allegi-
</p>
<p>ance ; for even the boldest had lost heart. Had
</p>
<p>any thing been wanting to convince him of the
</p>
<p>hopelessness of his cause, the report of his am-
</p>
<p>t)assadors returning from New Orleans would have
</p>
<p>banished every doubt. No record of his interview
</p>
<p>with them remains ; but it is easy to conceive with
</p>
<p>what chagrin he must have learned that the officer
</p>
<p>of France first in rank in all America had refused
</p>
<p>to aid him, and urged the timid counsels of peace.
</p>
<p>The vanity of those expectations, which had been
</p>
<p>the mainspring of his enterprise, now rose clear
</p>
<p>and palpable before him ; and, with rage and bit-
</p>
<p>terness, he saw the rotten foundation of his hopes
</p>
<p>sinking into dust, and the whole structure of his
</p>
<p>plot crumbling in ruins about him.
</p>
<p>All was lost. His allies were falling off, his fol
</p>
<p>lowers deserting him. To hold out longer would
</p>
<p>be destruction, and to fly was scarcely an easier
</p>
<p>task. In the south lay the Cherokees, hereditary
</p>
<p>enemies of his people. In the west were the
</p>
<p>Osages and Missouries, treacherous and uncertain
</p>
<p>friends, and the fierce and jealous Dahcotah. Id

</p>
<p>lish traders, and beset with English troops ; while
</p>
<p>in the north his own village of Detroit lay beneath
</p>
<p>the guns of the victorious garrison. He might,
</p>
<p>indeed, have found a partial refuge in the remoter

</p>
<p>left that place on the fifteenth of May, and em-

</p>
<p>shot dead on the spot ; most of the remainder
</p>
<p>were wounded ; and on the next instant the sur-
</p>
<p>vivors found themselves prisoners in the hands of
</p>
<p>eighty yelHng Kickapoos, who plundered them of
</p>
<p>all they had. No sooner, however, was their prey
</p>
<p>fairly within their clutches, than the cowardly
</p>
<p>assailants began to apologize for what they had
</p>
<p>done, saying it was all a mistake, and that the
</p>
<p>French had set them on by telling them that the
</p>
<p>Indians who accompanied Croghan were Chero-
</p>
<p>kees, their mortal enemies ; excuses utterly without

<p>their misconduct by such falsehoods as might sug-
</p>
<p>gest themselves to their invention.
</p>
<p>Still apologizing for what they had done, but by
</p>
<p>110 means suffering thei^ prisoners to escape, they
</p>
<p>proceeded up the Wabash, to the little French fort
</p>
<p>and settlement of Vincennes, where, to his great
</p>
<p>joy, Croghan found among the assembled Indians
</p>
<p>some of his former friends and acquaintance.
</p>
<p>They received him kindly, and sharply rebuked
</p>
<p>the Kickapoos, who, on their part, seemed much
</p>
<p>ashamed and crestfallen. From Vincennes the
</p>
<p>English were conducted, in a sort of honorable
</p>
<p>captivity, up the river to Ouatanon, where they
</p>
<p>arrived on the twenty-third, fifteen days after the
</p>
<p>attack, and where Croghan was fortunate enough
</p>
<p>to find a great number of his former Indian friends,
</p>
<p>who received him, to appearance at least, with
</p>
<p>much cordiality. He took up his quarters in the
</p>
<p>fort, where there was at this time no garrison, a
</p>
<p>mob of French traders and Indians being the only
</p>
<p>tenants of the place. For several days, his time
</p>
<p>was engrossed with receiving deputation after dep-
</p>
<p>utation from the various tribes and sub-tribes of the
</p>
<p>neighborhood, smoking pipes of peace, makirg and
</p>
<p>hearing speeches, and shaking hands with greasy
</p>
<p>warriors, who, one and all, were strong in their
</p>
<p>professions of good- will, promising not only to
</p>
<p>regard the English as their friends, but to aid them,
</p>
<p>if necessary, in taking possession of the Illinois.
</p>
<p>While these amicable conferences were in prog-
</p>
<p>ress, a miscreant Frenchman came from the Mis-

<p>sissippi with a message from a chief of that region,

</p>
<p>urging the Indians of Ouatanon to bum the Eng-
</p>
<p>lishman alive. Of this proposal the Indians signi-
</p>
<p>fied their strong disapprobation, and assured the
</p>
<p>startled envoy that they would stand his friends, 
</p>
<p>professions the sincerity of which, happily for him,
</p>
<p>was confirmed by the strong guaranty of their fears.
</p>
<p>The next arrival was that of Maisonville, a mes-
</p>
<p>senger from St. Ange, requesting Croghan to come
</p>
<p>to Fort Chartres, to adjust affairs in that quarter.
</p>
<p>The invitation was in accordance with Croghan's
</p>
<p>designs ; and he left the fort on the following day,
</p>
<p>attended by Maisonville, and a concourse of the
</p>
<p>Ouatanon Indians, who, far from regarding him as
</p>
<p>their prisoner, were now studious to show him
</p>
<p>every mark of respect. He had advanced but a
</p>
<p>short distance into the forest when he met Pontiac
</p>
<p>himself, who was on his way to Ouatanon, followed
</p>
<p>by a numerous train of chiefs and warriors. He
</p>
<p>gave his hand to the English envoy, and both par-
</p>
<p>ties returned together to the fort. Its narrow pre-
</p>
<p>cincts were now crowded with Indians, a perilous
</p>
<p>multitude, dark, malignant, inscrutable ; and it
</p>
<p>behooved the Englishman to be wary, in his dealings
</p>
<p>with them, since a breath might kindle afresh thp
</p>
<p>wildfire in their hearts.
</p>
<p>At a meeting of the chiefs and warriors, Pontiac
</p>
<p>offered the calumet and belt of peace, and professed
</p>
<p>his concurrence with the chiefs of Ouatanon in the
</p>
<p>friendly sentiments which they expressed towards
</p>
<p>the English. The French, he added, had deceived
</p>
<p>him, telling him and his people that the English

<p>meant to enslave the Indians of the Illinois, and

</p>
<p>turn loose upon them their enemies the Cherokees.
</p>
<p>It was this which drove him to arms : and now
</p>
<p>tliat he knew the story to be false, he would no
</p>
<p>longer stand in the path of the English. Yet they
</p>
<p>must not imagine that, in taking possession of the
</p>
<p>French forts, they gained any right to the country ;
</p>
<p>for the French had never bought the land, and lived
</p>
<p>upon it by sufferance only.
</p>
<p>As this meeting with Pontiac and the Illinois
</p>
<p>chiefs made it needless for Croghan to advance
</p>
<p>farther on his western journey, he now bent his
</p>
<p>footsteps towards Detroit, and, followed by Pontiac
</p>
<p>and many of the principal chiefs, crossed over to
</p>
<p>Fort Miami, and thence descended the Maumee,
</p>
<p>holding conferences at the several villages which
</p>
<p>he passed on his way. On the seventeenth of
</p>
<p>August, he reached Detroit, where he found a
</p>
<p>great gathering of Indians, Ottawas, Pottawatta-
</p>
<p>mies, and Ojibwas ; some encamped about the fort,
</p>
<p>and others along the banks of the River llouge.
</p>
<p>They obeyed his summons to a meeting with alac-
</p>
<p>rity, partly from a desire to win the good graces of
</p>
<p>a victorious enemy, and partly from the importu-
</p>
<p>nate craving for liquor and presents, which never
</p>
<p>slumbers in an Indian breast. Numerous meetings
</p>
<p>were held ; and the old council-hall where Pontiac
</p>
<p>had essayed his scheme of abortive treachery was
</p>
<p>now crowded with repentant warriors, anxious, by
</p>
<p>every form of submission, to appease the conqueror.
</p>
<p>Their ill success, their fears of chastisement, and
</p>
<p>the miseries they had endured from the long sus-

</p>
<p>minds every thought of hostility. They were glad,
</p>
<p>they said, that the dark clouds were now dispersing,
</p>
<p>and the sunshine of peace once more returning ;
</p>
<p>and since all the nations to the sunrising had taken
</p>
<p>their great father the King of England by the hand,
</p>
<p>they also wished to do the same. They now saw
</p>
<p>dearly that the French were indeed conquered ;
</p>
<p>and thenceforth they would listen no more to the
</p>
<p>whistling of evil birds, but lay down the war
</p>
<p>hatchet, and sit quiet on their mats. Among those
</p>
<p>who appeared to make or renew their submission
</p>
<p>was the Grand Sauteur, who had led the massacre
</p>
<p>at Michillimackinac, and who, a few years after
</p>
<p>expiated his evil deeds by a bloody death. He
</p>
<p>now pretended great regret for what he had done.
</p>
<p>" We red people," he said, " are a very jealous and
</p>
<p>foolish people ; but, father, there are some among
</p>
<p>the white men worse than we are, and they have
</p>
<p>told us lies, and deceived us. Therefore we hope
</p>
<p>you will take pity on our women and children, and
</p>
<p>grant us peace." A band of Pottawattamies from
</p>
<p>St. Joseph's were also present, and, after excusing
</p>
<p>themselves for their past conduct by the stale plea
</p>
<p>of tlie uncontrollable temper of their young men,
</p>
<p>their orator proceeded as follows : 
</p>
<p>" We are no more than wild creatures to you,
</p>
<p>fathers, in understanding ; therefore we request you
</p>
<p>to forgive the past follies of our young people, and
</p>
<p>receive us for your children. Since you have thrown
</p>
<p>down our former father on his back, we have been
</p>
<p>wandering in the dark, like blind people. Now

</p>
<p>over the heads of the several tribes, and have
</p>
<p>accepted them for your children, we hope you will
</p>
<p>let us partake with them the light, that our women
</p>
<p>and children may enjoy peace. We beg you to for-
</p>
<p>get all that is past. By this belt we remove all evil
</p>
<p>thoughts from your hearts.
</p>
<p>" Fathers, when we formerly came to visit our
</p>
<p>fathers the French, they always sent us home joy
</p>
<p>ful ; and we hope you, fathers, will have pity on
</p>
<p>our women and young men, who are in great want
</p>
<p>of necessaries, and not let us go home to our towns
</p>
<p>ashamed."
</p>
<p>On the twenty-seventh of August, Croghan held
</p>
<p>a meeting with the Ottawas, and the other tribes
</p>
<p>of Detroit and Sandusky ; when, adopting their
</p>
<p>own figurative language, he addressed them in the
</p>
<p>following speech, in which, as often happened
</p>
<p>when white men borrowed the tongue of the forest
</p>
<p>orator, he lavished a more unsparing profusion of
</p>
<p>imagery than the Indians themselves : 
</p>
<p>" Children, we are very glad to see so many of
</p>
<p>you here present at your ancient council-fire, which
</p>
<p>has been neglected for some time past ; since then,
</p>
<p>high winds have blown, and raised heavy clouds
</p>
<p>over your country. I now, by this belt, rekindle
</p>
<p>your ancient fire, and throw dry wood upon it, that
</p>
<p>the blaze may ascend to heaven, so that all nations
</p>
<p>may see it, and know that you live in peace and
</p>
<p>tranquillity with your fathers the English.
</p>
<p>" By this belt I disperse all the black clouds

<p>from over your heads, that the sun may shine clear

<p>and you, and all your younger brethren to the sun-

</p>
<p>" Children, by this belt I gather up all the bones
</p>
<p>of your deceased friends, and bury them deep in
</p>
<p>the ground, that the buds and sweet flowers of the
</p>
<p>earth may grow over them, that we may not see
</p>
<p>them any more.
</p>
<p>" Children, with this belt I take the hatchet out
</p>
<p>of your hands, and pluck up a large tree, and bury
</p>
<p>it deep, so that it may never be found any more;
</p>
<p>and I plant the tree of peace, which all our chil-

<p>dren may sit under, and smoke in peace with their

<p>preserve that road good and pleasant to travc.d

<p>upon, that we may all share the blessings of this
</p>
<p>happy union."
</p>
<p>On the following day, Pontiac spoke in behalf
</p>
<p>of the several nations assembled at the council.
</p>
<p>" Father, we have all smoked out of this pipe of
</p>
<p>peace. It is your children's pipe ; and as the wai

</p>
<p>all the nations now assembled ; and whenever any
</p>
<p>of those nations go to visit him, they may smoke
</p>
<p>out of it with him in peace. Fathers, we are
</p>
<p>obliged to you for lighting up our old council-fire

<p>for us, and desiring us to return to it ; but we are

<p>now settled on the Miami E-iver, not far from
</p>
<p>hence : whenever you want us, you will find us

<p>there." ^
</p>
<p>" Our people," he added, " love liquor, and if
</p>
<p>we dwelt near you in our old village of Detroit,
</p>
<p>dur warriors would be always drunk, and quarrels
</p>
<p>would arise between us and you." Drunkenness
</p>
<p>was, in truth, the bane of the whole unhappy race ;
</p>
<p>but Pontiac, too thoroughly an Indian in his virtues
</p>
<p>and his vices to be free from its destructive taint,

</p>
<p>journal has been twice published  in the appendix to Butler's History of
</p>
<p>Kentucky, and in the Pioneer History of Dr. Hildreth. A manuscript copy
</p>
<p>also may be found in the office of the secretary of state at Albany. Dr.
</p>
<p>Hildreth omits the speech of Croghan to the Indians, which is given above
</p>
<p>as affording a better example of the forms of speech appropriate to an
</p>
<p>Indian peace harangue, than the genuine productions of the Indians them-
</p>
<p>selves, who are less apt to indulge in such a redundancy of metaphor.
</p>
<p>A language extremely deficient in words of general and abstract signi-
</p>
<p>fication renders the use of figures indispensable ; and it is from this cause,
</p>
<p>above all others, that the flowers of Indian rhetoric derive their origin.
</p>
<p>In the work of Heckewelder will be found a list of numerous figurative
</p>
<p>expressions appropriate to the various occasions of public and private
</p>
<p>intercourse,  forms which are seldom departed from, and which are often
</p>
<p>found identical among tribes speaking languages radically distinct. Thus,
</p>
<p>among both Iroquois and Algonquins, the " whistling of evil birds " is
</p>
<p>the invariable expression to denote evil tidings or bad advice.
</p>
<p>The Indians are much pleased when white men whom they respecl
</p>
<p>adipt their peculiar symbolical language,  a circumstance of which the

<p>Jesuit missionaries did not fail to avail themselves. " These people,"
</p>
<p>Bays Father Le Jeune, " being great orators, and often using allegories
</p>
<p>and metaphors, our fatliers, in order to attract them to God, adapt them-
</p>
<p>Belves to their custom of speaking, which delights them very mu':h, see
</p>
<p>iiig we succeed as well as they."
</p>
<p>17G6.) CKOGHAN'S EFFORTS SUCCESSFUL- 297
</p>
<p>concluded his speech with the common termination
</p>
<p>of an Indian harangue, and desired that the rum
</p>
<p>barrel might be opened, and his thirsty warriors
</p>
<p>allowed to drink.
</p>
<p>At the end of September, having brought these
</p>
<p>protracted conferences to a close, Croghan left
</p>
<p>Detroit, and departed for Niagara, whence, after
</p>
<p>a short delay, he passed eastward, to report the
</p>
<p>results of his mission to the commander-in-chief.
</p>
<p>But before leaving the Indian country, he exacted
</p>
<p>from Pontiac a promise that in the spring he would
</p>
<p>descend to Oswego, and, in behalf of the tribes
</p>
<p>lately banded in his league, conclude a treaty of
</p>
<p>peace and amity with Sir William Johnson.^
</p>
<p>Croghan's efforts had been attended with signal
</p>
<p>success. The tribes of the west, of late bristling
</p>
<p>in defiance, and hot for fight, had craved forgive-
</p>
<p>ness, and proffered the calumet. The war was
</p>
<p>over ; the last flickerings of that wide conflagration
</p>
<p>had died away ; but the embers still glowed beneath
</p>
<p>the ashes, and fuel and a breath alone were want-
</p>
<p>ing to rekindle those desolating fires.
</p>
<p>In the mean time, a hundred Highlanders of the
</p>
<p>4 2d Regiment, those veterans whose battle-cry had
</p>
<p>echoed over the bloodiest fields of America, had

<p>as his journal, Croghan gives his impression of Pontiac in the following
</p>
<p>words : 
</p>
<p>" Pondiac is a shrewd, sensible Indian, of few words, and commands
</p>
<p>more respect among his own nation than any Indian I ever saw could do
</p>
<p>among liis own tribe. He, and all the principal men of those nations,
</p>
<p>seem at present to be convinced that the French had a view of interest in
</p>
<p>stirring up the late differences between liis Majesty's subjects and them,

<p>1766-1769.
</p>
<p>DEATH OF PONTIAC.
</p>
<p>The winter passed quietly away. Already the
</p>
<p>Indians began to feel the blessings of returning
</p>
<p>peace in the partial reopening of the fur-trade ;
</p>
<p>and the famine and nakedness, the misery and
</p>
<p>death, which through the previous season had
</p>
<p>been rife in their encampments, were exchanged
</p>
<p>for comparative comfort and abundance. With
</p>
<p>many precautions, and in meagre allowances, the
</p>
<p>traders had been permitted to throw their goods
</p>
<p>into the Indian markets ; and the starving hunters
</p>
<p>were no longer left, as many of them had been, to
</p>
<p>gain precarious sustenance by the bow, the arrow,
</p>
<p>and the lance  the half- forgotten weapons of their
</p>
<p>fathers. Some troubles arose along the frontiers
</p>
<p>of Pennsylvania and Virginia. The reckless bor-
</p>
<p>derers, in contempt of common humanity and pru-
</p>
<p>dence, murdered several straggling Indians, and
</p>
<p>enraged others by abuse and insult; but these
</p>
<p>outrages could not obliterate the remembrance of
</p>
<p>recent chastisement, and, for the present at least,
</p>
<p>the injured warriors forbore to draw down the

</p>
<p>Spring returned, and Pontiac remembered the
</p>
<p>promise he had made to visit Sir William Johnson
</p>
<p>at Oswego. He left his encampment on the Mau-
</p>
<p>niee, accompanied by his chiefs, and by an English
</p>
<p>man named Crawford, a man of vigor and resolution,
</p>
<p>who had been appointed, by the superintendent,
</p>
<p>to the troublesome office of attending the Indian
</p>
<p>deputation, and supplying their wants. ^
</p>
<p>We may well imagine with what bitterness of

<p>mood the defeated war-chief urged his canoe along
</p>
<p>the margin of Lake Erie, and gazed upon the hori-
</p>
<p>zon-bounded waters, and the lofty shores, green
</p>
<p>with primeval verdure. Little could he have
</p>
<p>dreamed, and little could the wisest of that day
</p>
<p>have imagined, that, within the space of a single
</p>
<p>human life, that lonely lake would be studded with
</p>
<p>the sails of commerce ; that cities and villages
</p>
<p>would rise upon the ruins of the forest ; and that
</p>
<p>the poor mementoes of his lost race  the wampum
</p>
<p>beads, the rusty tomahawk, and the arrowhead of
</p>
<p>stone, turned up by the ploughshare  would
</p>
<p>become the wonder of school-boys, and the prized
</p>
<p>relics of the antiquary's cabinet. Yet it needed
</p>
<p>no prophetic eye to foresee that, sooner or later,
</p>
<p>the doom must come. The star of his people's
</p>
<p>destiny was fading from the sky ; and, to a mind

<p>like his, the black and withering future must have
</p>
<p>stood revealed in all its desolation.

<p>1766.] PONTLVC AT OSWEGO. ^01
</p>
<p>The chiefs passed the portage, and, once more
</p>
<p>embarking, pushed out upon Lake Ontario. Soon
</p>
<p>their goal was reached, and the cannon boomed
</p>
<p>hollow salutation from the batteries of Oswego.
</p>
<p>Here they found Sir William Johnson waiting to
</p>
<p>receive them, attended by the chief sachems of the
</p>
<p>Iroquois, whom he had invited to the spot, that
</p>
<p>their presence might give additional weight and
</p>
<p>solemnity to the meeting. As there was no build-
</p>
<p>ing large enough to receive so numerous a con
</p>
<p>course, a canopy of green boughs was erected to
</p>
<p>shade the assembly from the sun ; and thither, on
</p>
<p>the twenty-third of July, repaired the chiefs and
</p>
<p>warriors of the several nations. Here stood the
</p>
<p>tall figure of Sir William Johnson, surrounded by
</p>
<p>civil and military officers, clerks, and interpreters ;
</p>
<p>while before him reclined the painted sachems of
</p>
<p>the Iroquois, and the great Ottawa war-chief, w^ith
</p>
<p>his dejected followers.
</p>
<p>Johnson opened the meeting with the usual f{ i
</p>
<p>malities, presenting his auditors with a belt of wam-
</p>
<p>pum to wipe the tears from their eyes, with another
</p>
<p>to cover the bones of their relatives, another to open
</p>
<p>their ears that they might hear, and another to
</p>
<p>clear their throats that they might speak with ease.
</p>
<p>Then, amid solemn silence, Pontiac's great peace-
</p>
<p>pipe was lighted and passed round the assembly,
</p>
<p>each man present inhaling a whiff of the sacred
</p>
<p>smoke. These tedious forms, together with a few
</p>
<p>speeches of compliment, consumed the whole
</p>
<p>morning ; for this savage people, on whose sup-

<p>outmatch their bigoted adherence to usage and

<p>ceremonial.
</p>
<p>On the following day, the council began in
</p>
<p>earnest, and Sir Willian; Johnson addressed Pon-
</p>
<p>tiac and his attendant chiefs.
</p>
<p>'^ Children, I bid you heartily welcome to this
</p>
<p>place and I trust that the Great Spirit will permit
</p>
<p>us often to meet together in friendship, for I have
</p>
<p>now opened the door and cleared the road, that all
</p>
<p>nations may come hither from the sunsetting. This
</p>
<p>belt of wampum confirms my words.
</p>
<p>" Children, it gave me much pleasure to find
</p>
<p>that you who are present behaved so well last year,
</p>
<p>and treated in so friendly a manner Mr. Croghan,
</p>
<p>one of my deputies ; and that you expressed such
</p>
<p>concern for the bad behavior of those, who, in
</p>
<p>order to obstruct the good work of peace, assaulted
</p>
<p>and wounded him, and killed some of his party,
</p>
<p>both whites and Indians ; a thing before unknown,
</p>
<p>and contrary to the laws and customs of all nations.
</p>
<p>This would have drawn down our strongest resent-
</p>
<p>ment upon those who were guilty of so heinous a
</p>
<p>crime, were it not for the great lenity and kindness
</p>
<p>of your English father, who does not delight in
</p>
<p>punishing those who repent sincerely of their faults.
</p>
<p>" Children, I have now, with the approbation of
</p>
<p>General Gage (your father s chief warrior in this
</p>
<p>country), invited you here in order to confirm and
</p>
<p>strengthen your proceedings with Mr. Croghan last
</p>
<p>year. I hope that you will remember all that then

</p>
<p>to your young people, and keep it fresh in your
</p>
<p>minds.
</p>
<p>" Children, you begin already to see the fruits of
</p>
<p>peace, from the number of traders and plenty of
</p>
<p>goods at all the garrisoned posts ; and our enjoying
</p>
<p>the peaceable possession of the Illinois will be
</p>
<p>found of great advantage to the Indians in that
</p>
<p>country. You likewise see that proper officers,
</p>
<p>men of honor and probity, are appointed to reside
</p>
<p>at the posts, to prevent abuses in trade, to hear
</p>
<p>your complaints, and to lay before me such of them
</p>
<p>as they cannot redress.^ Interpreters are likewise
</p>
<p>sent for the assistance of each of them ; and smiths
</p>
<p>are sent to the posts to repair your arms and imple-
</p>
<p>ments. All this, which is attended with a great
</p>
<p>expense, is now done by the great King, your
</p>
<p>father, as a proof of his regard ; so that, casting
</p>
<p>from you all jealousy and apprehension, you should
</p>
<p>now strive with each other who should show the
</p>
<p>most gratitude to this best of princes. I do now,
</p>
<p>therefore, confirm the assurances which I give you
</p>
<p>of his Majesty's good will, and do insist on your
</p>
<p>casting away all evil thoughts, and shutting your
</p>
<p>ears against all flying idle reports of bad people."
</p>
<p>The rest of Johnson's speech was occupied in
</p>
<p>explaining to his hearers the new arrangements for
</p>
<p>the regulation of the fur-trade ; in exhorting thera
</p>
<p>' The Lords of Trade had recently adopted a new plan for the man-
</p>
<p>Hgement of Indian affairs, the principal feature of which was the confine-
</p>
<p>ment of the traders to the mihtary posts, where they would conduct their
</p>
<p>traffic under tlie eye of proper officers, instead of ranging at will, without
</p>
<p>Buperyision or control, among the Indian villages. It was found extremely

</p>
<p>to forbear from retaliating the injuries tbey might
</p>
<p>receive from reckless white men, who would meet
</p>
<p>with due punishment from their own countrymen ;
</p>
<p>and in urging them to deliver up to justice those
</p>
<p>of their people w4io might be guilty of crimes
</p>
<p>against the English. '' Children," he concluded,
</p>
<p>" I now, by this belt, turn your eyes to the sunris-
</p>
<p>ing, where you will always find me your sincere
</p>
<p>friend. From me you will always hear what is
</p>
<p>true and good ; and I charge you never more to
</p>
<p>listen to those evil birds, who come, with lying
</p>
<p>tongues, to lead you astray, and to make you break
</p>
<p>the solemn engagements which you have entered
</p>
<p>into, in presence of the Great Spirit, with the King
</p>
<p>your father and the English people. Be strong,
</p>
<p>then, and keep fast hold of the chain of friendship,
</p>
<p>that your children, following your example, may
</p>
<p>live happy and prosperous lives."
</p>
<p>Pontiac made a brief reply, and promised to
</p>
<p>return on the morrow an answer in full. The
</p>
<p>meeting then broke up.
</p>
<p>The council of the next day was opened by the
</p>
<p>Wyandot chief, Teata, in a short and formal
</p>
<p>address ; at the conclusion of which Pontiac him-
</p>
<p>self arose, and addressed the superintendent in
</p>
<p>-words, of w^hich the following is a translation :
</p>
<p>" Father, we thank the Great Spirit for giving us
</p>
<p>so "fine a day to meet upon such great affairs. I
</p>
<p>speak in the name of all the nations to the west-
</p>
<p>ward, of w^hom I am the master. It is the will of
</p>
<p>the Great Spirit that we should meet here to-day ;

<p>and before him I now take you by the hand. I
</p>
<p>1766.J po:ntiac's reply to JOHNSON. ;305
</p>
<p>call him to witness that I speak from my heart ;
</p>
<p>for since I took Colonel Croghan by the hand last
</p>
<p>year, I have never let go my hold, for I see that
</p>
<p>the Great Spirit will have ns friends.
</p>
<p>*' Fatlier, when our great father of France was
</p>
<p>in this country, I held him fast by the hand. Now
</p>
<p>that he is gone, I take you, my English father, by
</p>
<p>the hand, in the name of all the nations, and prom-
</p>
<p>ise to keep this covenant as long as I shall live."
</p>
<p>Here he delivered a large belt of wampum.
</p>
<p>" Father, when you address me, it is the same as
</p>
<p>if you addressed all the nations of the west. Father,
</p>
<p>this belt is to cover and strengthen our chain of
</p>
<p>friendship, and to show you that, if any nation shall
</p>
<p>lift the hatchet against our English brethren, we
</p>
<p>shall be the first to feel it and resent it."
</p>
<p>Pontiac next took up in succession the various
</p>
<p>points touched upon in the speech of the superin-
</p>
<p>tendent, expressing in all things a full compliance
</p>
<p>with his wishes. The succeeding days of the con-
</p>
<p>ference were occupied with matters of detail relat-
</p>
<p>ing chiefly to the fur- trade, all of w^hich were
</p>
<p>adjusted to the apparent satisfaction of the Indians,
</p>
<p>who, on their part, made reiterated professions of
</p>
<p>friendship. Pontiac promised to recall the war-
</p>
<p>belts which had been sent to the north and west,
</p>
<p>though, as he alleged, many of them had proceeded
</p>
<p>from the Senecas,' and not from him ; adding tliat,
</p>
<p>when all were gathered together, they would be
</p>
<p>more than a man could carry. The Iroquois sach-
</p>
<p>ems then addressed the western nations, exhorting
</p>
<p>them to stand true to their engagements, and hold

<p>fast the chain of friendship ; and the councils
</p>
<p>closed on the thirty-first, with a bountiful distribu-
</p>
<p>tion of presents to Pontiac and his followers.^
</p>
<p>Thus ended this memorable meeting, in T\hich
</p>
<p>Pontiac sealed his submission to the English, and
</p>
<p>renounced for ever the bold design by which he had
</p>
<p>trusted to avert or retard the ruin of his race. Hig
</p>
<p>hope of seeing the empire of France restored in
</p>
<p>America was scattered to the winds, and with it
</p>
<p>vanished every rational scheme of resistance to
</p>
<p>English encroachment. Nothing now remained
</p>
<p>but to stand an idle spectator, while, in the north
</p>
<p>and in the south, the tide of British power rolled
</p>
<p>westward in resistless might ; while the fragments
</p>
<p>of the rival empire, which he would fain have set
</p>
<p>up as a barrier against the flood, lay scattered a
</p>
<p>miserable wreck ; and while the remnant of his
</p>
<p>people melted away or fled for refuge to remoter
</p>
<p>deseits. For them the prospects of the future
</p>
<p>were as clear as they were calamitous. Destruc-
</p>
<p>tion or civilization  between these lay their choice ;
</p>
<p>and few who knew them could doubt which alter
</p>
<p>native they would embrace.
</p>
<p>Pontiac, his canoe laden with the gifts of his
</p>
<p>enemy, steered homeward for the Maumee ; and in
</p>
<p>this vicinity he spent the following winter, pitching
</p>
<p>his lodge in the forest with his wives and children,

</p>
<p>and hunting like an ordinary warrior. Witli the
</p>
<p>succeeding spring, 1767, fresh murmurings of dis
</p>
<p>content arose among the Indian tribes, from the
</p>
<p>lakes to the Potomac, the first precursors of tlie
</p>
<p>disorders which, a few years later, ripened into a
</p>
<p>brief but bloody war along the borders of Virginia.
</p>
<p>These threatening symptoms might easily be trace 1
</p>
<p>to their source. The incorrigible frontiersmen had
</p>
<p>again let loose their murdering propensities ; and a
</p>
<p>multitude of squatters had built their cabins on
</p>
<p>Indian lands beyond the limits of Pennsylvania,
</p>
<p>adding insult to aggression, and sparing neither
</p>
<p>oaths, curses, nor any form of abuse and maltreat-
</p>
<p>ment against the rightful owners of the soil.' The
</p>
<p>new regulations of the fur-trade could not prevent
</p>
<p>disorders among the reckless men engaged in it.
</p>
<p>This Avas particularly the case in the region of the
</p>
<p>Illinois, where the evil was aggravated by the
</p>
<p>renewed intrigues of the French, and especially of
</p>
<p>those who had fled from the English side of the
</p>
<p>Mississippi, and made their abode around the new
</p>
<p>settlement of St. Louis.^ It is difficult to say how
</p>
<p>far Pontiac was involved in this agitation. It is
</p>
<p>certain that some of the English traders regarded
</p>
<p>him with jealousy and fear, as prime mover of the
</p>
<p>whole, and eagerly watched an opportunity to
</p>
<p>destroy him.
</p>
<p>The discontent among the tribes did not diminish
</p>
<p>1 " It seems/' writes Sir William Johnson to the lords of trade, " as
</p>
<p>if the people were determined to bring on a new war, though their own
</p>
<p>niin may be the consequence."

</p>
<p>with the lapse of time ; yet for many months we
</p>
<p>can discern no trace of Pontiac. Records and tra-
</p>
<p>ditions are silent concerning him. It is not until
</p>
<p>April, 1769, that he appears once more distinctly
</p>
<p>on the scene. ^ At about that time he came to the
</p>
<p>Illinois, with what design does not appear, though
</p>
<p>his movements excited much uneasiness among the
</p>
<p>few English in that quarter. Soon after his arrival,
</p>
<p>he repaired to St. Louis, to visit his former acquaint-
</p>
<p>ance, St. Ange, who was then in command at that
</p>
<p>post, having offered his services to the Spaniards
</p>
<p>after the cession of Louisiana. After leaving the
</p>
<p>fort, Pontiac proceeded to the house of which
</p>
<p>young Pierre Chouteau was an inmate ; and to the
</p>
<p>last days of his protracted life, the latter could viv-
</p>
<p>idly recall the circumstances of the interview. The
</p>
<p>savage chief was arrayed in the full uniform of a
</p>
<p>French officer, which had been presented to him as
</p>
<p>a special mark of respect and favor by the Marquis
</p>
<p>of Montcalm, towards the close of the French war,
</p>
<p>and which Pontiac never had the bad taste to wear,
</p>
<p>except on occasions when he wished to appear with
</p>
<p>unusual dignity. St. Ange, Chouteau, and the
</p>
<p>other principal inhabitants of the infant settlement,
</p>
<p>whom he visited in turn, all received him cordially,
</p>
<p>and did their best to entertain him and his attend-
</p>
<p>i Carver says that Pontiac was killed in 1767. This may possibly
</p>
<p>be a mere printer's error. In the Maryland Gazette, and also in the Penn-
</p>
<p>sylvania Gazette, were published during tlie month of August, 1769, several
</p>
<p>letters from the Indian country, in which Pontiac is mentioned as having
</p>
<p>been killed during the preceding April. M. Chouteau states that, to the
</p>
<p>best of his recollection, the chief was killed in 1768 ; but oral testimony
</p>

<p>ant chiefs. He remained at St. Louis for two or
</p>
<p>three days, when, hearing that a large number of
</p>
<p>Indians were assembled at Cahokia, on the opposite
</p>
<p>side of the river, and that some drinking bout or
</p>
<p>other social gathering was in progress, he told St
</p>
<p>A.nge that he would cross over to see what was
</p>
<p>going forward. St. Ange tried to dissuade him,
</p>
<p>and urged the risk to which he would expose him
</p>
<p>self ; but Pontiac persisted, boasting that he was a
</p>
<p>match for the English, and had no fear for his life.
</p>
<p>He entered a canoe with some of his followers, and
</p>
<p>Chouteau never saw him again.

<p>He who, at the present day, crosses from the city
</p>

<p>tooned with grape-vines, and fragrant with the

</p>
<p>woods which form the background of the picture,
</p>
<p>seem like the remnants of an earlier and simpler
</p>
<p>world. Strange changes have passed around that
</p>
<p>spot. Forests have fallen, cities have sprung up,
</p>
<p>and the lonely wilderness is thronged with human
</p>
<p>life. Nature herself has taken part in the general
</p>
<p>transformation ; and the Mississippi has made a
</p>
<p>fearful inroad, robbing from the luckless Creoles a
</p>
<p>mile of rich meadow and woodland. Yet, in the

</p>
<p>has preserved its essential features through the
</p>
<p>310 DEATH OF PONTIAC. [1769.
</p>
<p>lapse of a century, and offers at this day an aspect
</p>
<p>not widely different from that which met the eye
</p>
<p>of Pontiac, when he and his chiefs landed on its
</p>
<p>shore.
</p>
<p>The place was full of Illinois Indians ; such a
</p>
<p>scene as in our own time may often be met with in
</p>
<p>some squalid settlement of the border, where the
</p>
<p>vagabond guests, bedizened with dirty fmery, tie
</p>
<p>their small horses in rows along the fences, and
</p>
<p>stroll idly among the houses, or lounge about the
</p>
<p>dramshops. A chief so renowned as Pontiac could
</p>
<p>not remain long among the friendly Creoles of
</p>
<p>Cahokia without being summoned to a feast ; and
</p>
<p>at snch primitive entertainment the whiskey-bottle
</p>
<p>would not fail to play its part. This was in truth
</p>
<p>the case. Pontiac drank deeply, and, when the
</p>
<p>carousal was over, strode down the village street to
</p>
<p>the adjacent woods, where he was heard to sing
</p>
<p>the medicine songs, in whose magic power he
</p>
<p>trusted as the warrant of success in all his under-
</p>
<p>takings.
</p>
<p>An English trader, named Williamson, was then
</p>
<p>in the village. He had looked on the movements
</p>
<p>of Pontiac with a jealousy probably not diminished
</p>
<p>by the visit of the chief to the French at St. Louis ;
</p>
<p>and he now resolved not to lose so favorable an
</p>
<p>opportunity to despatch him. With this view, he
</p>
<p>gained the ear of a strolling Indian, belonging to
</p>
<p>the Kaskaskia tribe of the Illinois, bribed him with
</p>
<p>a barrel of liquor, and promised him a farther
</p>
<p>reward if he would kill the chief. The bargain

</p>
<p>was quickly made. When Pontiac entered the
</p>
<p>1769.] DEATH OF PONTIAC. *6l\
</p>
<p>forest, the assassin stole close upon bis track ; and,
</p>
<p>watching his moment, glided behind him, and
</p>
<p>buried a tomahawk in his brain.
</p>
<p>The df ad body was soon discovered, and startled
</p>
<p>cries and wild bowlings announcd the event. The
</p>
<p>wori was caught up from mouth to mouth, and the
</p>
<p>place resounded with infernal yells. The warriors
</p>
<p>snatched their weapons. The Illinois took part
</p>
<p>with their guilty countryman ; and the few follow
</p>
<p>ers of Pontiac, driven from the village, fled to
</p>
<p>spread the tidings and call the nations to revenge.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the murdered chief lay on the spot
</p>
<p>where he had fallen, until St. Ange, mindful of
</p>
<p>former friendship, sent to claim the body, and
</p>
<p>buried it with warlike honors, near his fort of St.
</p>
<p>Louis. ^
</p>
<p>1 Carver, Travels, 166, says that Pontiac was stabbed at a public
</p>
<p>council in the Illinois, by " a faithful Indian who was either commissioned
</p>
<p>by one of the English governors, or instigated by the love he bore the
</p>
<p>English nation." This account is without sufficient confirmation. Car-
</p>
<p>rer, who did not visit the Illinois, must have drawn his information from
</p>
<p>hearsay. The open manner of dealing with his victim, which he ascribes
</p>
<p>to the assassin, is wholly repugnant to Indian character and principles ;
</p>
<p>while the gross charge, thrown out at random against an English governor,
</p>
<p>might of itself cast discredit on the story.
</p>
<p>I have followed the account which I received from M. Pierre Chouteau,
</p>
<p>and from M. P. L. Cerre, another old inhabitant of the Illinois, whose
</p>
<p>fatlier was well acquainted with Pontiac. The same account may be
</p>
<p>found, concisely stated, in Nicollet, p. 81. M. Nicollet states that he
</p>
<p>derived his information both from M. Chouteau and from the no les
</p>
<p>respectable autuDrity of the aged Pierre Menard of Kaskaskia. The
</p>
<p>notices of Pontiac's death in the provincial journals of the day, to a cer-
</p>
<p>tain extent, confirm this story. We gather from them, that he was killed
</p>
<p>at the Illinois, by one or more Kaskaskia Indians, during a drunken frolic,

<p>and in consequence of his hostility to the English. One letter, however,
</p>
<p>states on hearsay that he was killed near Fort Chartres ; and Qouin's tra-
</p>
<p>ditional account seems to support the statement. On this point, I have
</p>
<p>followed the distinct and circumstantial narrative of Chouteau, supported
</p>
<p>as it is by Cerre. An Ottawa tradition declares that Pontiac tnok a E[a

</p>
<p>Thus basely perished this champion of a ruined
</p>
<p>race. But could his shade have revisited the scene
</p>
<p>of nuirder, his savage spirit would have exulted in
</p>
<p>the vengeance which overwhelmed the abettors
</p>
<p>of the crime. Whole tribes were rooted out to
</p>
<p>expiate it. Chiefs and sachems, whose veins had
</p>
<p>thrilled with his eloquence ; young warriors, whose
</p>
<p>aspiring hearts had caught the inspiration of his
</p>
<p>greatness, mustered to revenge his fate ; and, from
</p>
<p>the north and the east, their united bands descended
</p>
<p>on the villages of the Illinois. Tradition has but
</p>
<p>faintly preserved the memory of the event ; and its
</p>
<p>only annalists, men who held the intestine feuds of
</p>
<p>the savage tribes in no more account than the
</p>
<p>quarrels of panthers or wildcats, have left but a
</p>
<p>meagre record. Yet enough remains to tell us
</p>
<p>that over the grave of Pontiac more blood was
</p>
<p>poured out in atonement, than flowed from the
</p>
<p>veins of the slaughtered heroes on the corpse of
</p>
<p>Patroclus ; and the remnant of the Illinois who

<p>valuable assistance in my inquiries in relation to Pontiac's death.

<p>Neither mound nor tablet marked the burial-
</p>
<p>place of Pontiac. For a mausoleum, a city has
</p>
<p>risen above the forest hero ; and the race whom
</p>
<p>he hated with such burning rancor trample with
</p>
<p>unceasing footsteps over his forgotten grave.
</p>
<p>similar mistakes, may easily have arisen from the fact that he was ace us
</p>
<p>tomed to assume authority over the warriors of any tribe with whom he
</p>
<p>chanced to be in contact.
</p>
<p>Morse says, in his Report, 1822 : " In the war kindled against these
</p>
<p>tribes, [Peorias, Kaskaskias, and Cahokias,] by the Sauks and Foxes, in
</p>
<p>revenge for the death of their chief, Pontiac, these 3 tribes were nearly
</p>
<p>exterminated. Few of them now remain. About one hundred of the
</p>
<p>Peorias are settled on Current River, W. of the Mississippi ; of the Kas
</p>
<p>kaskias 36 only remain in Illinois."  Morse, 368.
</p>
<p>General Gage, in his letter to Sir William Johnson, dated July 10,
</p>
<p>176-, says : " The death of Pontiac, committed by an Indian of the Illi
</p>
<p>nois, beheved to have been excited by the English to that action, had
</p>
<p>drawn many of the Ottawas and other northern nations towards their
</p>
<p>country to revenge his death."
</p>
<p>" From Miami, Pontiac went to Fort Chartres on the Illinois. In a
</p>
<p>few years^ the English, who had possession of the fort, procured an Indian
</p>
<p>of the Peoria [Kaskaskia] nation to kill him. The news spread like
</p>
<p>lightning through the country. The Indians assembled in great numbers,
</p>
<p>attacked and destroyed all the Peorias, except about thirty families, which
</p>
<p>were received into the fort. These soon began to increase. They
</p>
<p>removed to the Wabash, and were about to settle, when the Indians col-
</p>
<p>lected in the winter, surrounded their village, and killed the whole, except-
</p>
<p>ing a few children, who were saved as prisoners. Old Mr. Gouin was
</p>
<p>there at the time. He was a trader; and, when the attack commenced,
</p>
<p>was ordered by the Indians to shut his house and not suffer a Peoria to
</p>
<p>enter."  Gouin's Account, MS.
</p>
<p>Pontiac left several children. A speech of his son Shegenaba, in
</p>
<p>1775, is preserved in Force's American Archives, Uh Series, III. 1542.
</p>
<p>There was another son, named Otussa, whose grave is on the Maumee.

<p>November 13, 1768: 
</p>
<p>My Lords :
</p>
<p>In obedience to your Lordships' commands of the 5th of August last,
</p>
<p>I am now to lay before you the claims of the Nations mentioned in the
</p>
<p>State of the Confederacies. The Five Nations have in the last century
</p>
<p>subdued the Shawanese, Delawares, Twighties, and Western Indians, so
</p>
<p>far as Lakes Micliigan and Superior, received them into an alliance,
</p>
<p>allowed them the possession of the lands they occupied, and have ever
</p>
<p>since been in peace with the greatest part of them ; and such was the
</p>
<p>prowess of the Five Nations' Confederacy, that had they been properly
</p>
<p>supported by us, they would have long since put a period to the Colony
</p>
<p>of Canada, which alone they were near effecting in the year 1688. Since
</p>
<p>that rime, they have admitted the Tuscaroras from the Southward,
</p>
<p>be\()iil Uneida, and they have ever since formed a part of that Con-
</p>
<p>federacy.
</p>
<p>As original proprietors, this Confederacy claim the country of their
</p>
<p>residence, south of Lake Ontario to the great Ridge of the Blue Moun-
</p>
<p>tains, with all the Western Part of the Province of New York towards
</p>
<p>Hudson River, west of the Catskill, thence to Lake Champlain, and from
</p>
<p>Regioghne, a Rock at the East side of said Lake, to Oswegatche or La
</p>
<p>Gallette, on the River St. Lawrence, (having long since ceded their claim
</p>
<p>north of said Une in favor of the Canada Indians, as Hunting-ground,)

</p>
<p>In right of cooiuest, they claim all the country (comprehending the

<p>Ohio) along the great Ridge of Blue INIountains at the back of Virginia,
</p>
<p>thence to the head of Kentucky River, and down the same to the Ohio
</p>
<p>above the Rifts, thence Northerly to the South end of Lake Michigan,

<p>then along the Eastern shore of said lake to Michillimackinac, thence
</p>
<p>Easterly across the North end of Lake Huron to the great Ottawa River,
</p>
<p>(including the Chippewa or Mississagey County,) and down the said

<p>being possessed by many powerful nations, the Inhabitants liave long

<p>begun to render themselves independent, by the assistance of the French,
</p>
<p>and the great decrease of the Six Nations ; but tlieir claim to tlie Ohio
</p>
<p>and thence to the Lakes, is not in the least disputed by the Shawaneso,
</p>
<p>Delawares, &c., who never transacted any sales of land or other matters

</p>
<p>Extract from a Letter  Sir W. Johnson to the Board of Trade,
</p>
<p>May 24, 1765: 
</p>
<p>The Indians of the Six Nations, after the arrival of the English, hav-
</p>
<p>ing conceived a desire for many articles they introduced among them,
</p>
<p>and thereby finding them of use to their necessities, or rather superflui-
</p>
<p>ties, cultivated an acquaintance with them, and lived in tolerable
</p>
<p>friendship with their Province for some time, to which they were rather
</p>
<p>inclined, for they were strangers to bribery, and at enmity with the
</p>
<p>French, who had espoused the cause of their enemies, supplied them
</p>
<p>with arms, and openly acted against them. This enmity increased in
</p>
<p>proportion as the desire of the French for subduing those people, who
</p>
<p>were a bar to their first projected schemes. However, we find the In-
</p>
<p>dians, as fe.r back as the very confused manuscript records in my posses-
</p>
<p>sion, repeatedly upbraiding this provmce for their negUgence, their avarice,
</p>
<p>and their want of assisting them at a time when it was certainly in their
</p>
<p>power to destroy the infant colony of Canada, although supported bv many
</p>
<p>nations ; and this is likewise confessed by the writings of the managers

<p>of these times. The French, after repeated losses discovering that the
</p>
<p>Six Nations were not to be subdued, but that they could without much
</p>
<p>difficulty effect their purpose (which I have good authority to sliow were
</p>
<p>.... standing) by favors and kindness, on a sudden, changed their con
</p>
<p>duct in tlie reign of Queen Anne, having first brouglit over many of their
</p>
<p>people to settle in Canada ; and ever since, by the most endearing kind-
</p>
<p>nesses and by a vast profusion of favors, have secured them to theil
</p>
<p>Interest; and, whilst they aggravated our frauds and designs, they cov-
</p>
<p>ered those committed by themselves under a load of gifts, which oblit
</p>
<p>APPENDIX A. 311
</p>
<p>crated the malpracti(;es of ... . among them, and enaMed them to
</p>
<p>establish themselves wherever they pleased, without fomenting the
</p>
<p>Indians' jealousy. The able agents were made use of, and their unani-
</p>
<p>mous indefatigable zeal for securing the Indian interest, were so much
</p>
<p>superior to any thing we had ever attempted, and to the futile transactions
</p>
<p>of the ... and trading Commissioners of Albany, that the latter
</p>
<p>became universally despised by the Indians, who daily withdrew from
</p>
<p>our interest, and conceived the most disadvantageous sentiments cf oui
</p>
<p>integrity and abilities. In this state of Indian affairs I was called to
</p>
<p>the management of these people, as my situation and opinion that it might
</p>
<p>become one day of service to the public, had induced me to cultivate a
</p>
<p>particular intimacy with these people, to accommodate myself to their
</p>
<p>manners, and even to their dress on many occasions. How I discharged
</p>
<p>this trust will best appear from the transactions of the war commenced in
</p>
<p>1744, in which I was busily concerned. The steps I had then taken
</p>
<p>alarmed the jealousy of the French ; rewards were offered for me, and I
</p>
<p>narrowly escaped assassination on more than one occasion. The French
</p>
<p>increased their munificence to the Indians, whose example not being at
</p>
<p>all followed at New York, I resigned the management of affairs on the
</p>
<p>ensuing peace, as I did not choose to continue in the name of an office
</p>
<p>which I was not empowered to discharge as its nature required. The
</p>
<p>Albany Commissioners (the men concerned in the clandestine trade to
</p>
<p>Canada, and frequently upbraided for it by the Indians) did then reassume
</p>
<p>their seats at that Board, and by their conduct so exasperated the Indians
</p>
<p>that several chiefs went to New York, 1753, when, after a severe speech
</p>
<p>to the Governor, Council, and Assembly, they broke the covenant chain
</p>
<p>)f friendship, and withdrew in a rage. The consequences of which were
</p>
<p>then so much dreaded, that I was, by Governor, Council, and House of
</p>
<p>Assembly, the two latter then my enemies, earnestly entreated to effect a
</p>
<p>reconciliation with the Indians, as the only person equal to that task, as
</p>
<p>will appear by the Minutes of Council and resolves of the House. A
</p>
<p>commission being made out for me, I proceeded to Onondaga, and brought
</p>
<p>about the much wished for reconciliation, but declined having any fur-
</p>
<p>ther to say of Indian affairs, although the Indians afterwards refused to

<p>meet the Governor and Commissioners till I was sent for. At the arrival
</p>
<p>of General Braddock, I received his Commission with reluctance, at the
</p>
<p>same time assuring him that affairs had been so ill conducted, and the
</p>
<p>Indians so estranged from our interest, that I could not take upon me to
</p>
<p>hope for success. However, indefatigable labor, and (I hope I may say
</p>
<p>without vanity) personal interest, enabled me to exceed my own expecta-
</p>
<p>tions ; and my conduct since, if fully and truly known, would, I believe,
</p>
<p>testify that I have not been an unprofitable servant. 'Twas then that
</p>
<p>the Indians began to give public sign of their avaricious dispositions.
</p>
<p>The French had long taught them it ; and the desire of some persons to
</p>
<p>carry a greater number of Indians into the field in 1755 than those who
</p>
<p>accompanied me, induced them to employ any agent at a high salary,
</p>
<p>who had tlie least interest with the Indians ; and to grant the latter Cap

<p>me,) with sterhng pay, to induce them to desert me, but to httle purpose,
</p>
<p>for tho' many of them received the Commissions, accompanied with large
</p>
<p>sums of monej', they did not comply with the end proposed, but served with
</p>
<p>me ; and this had not only served them witli severe complaints against
</p>
<p>the English, as they were not afterwards all paid what had been promised,
</p>
<p>but has established a spirit of pride and avarice, which I have found it
</p>
<p>ever since impossible to subdue ; whilst our extensive connections since the
</p>
<p>reduction of Canada, with so many powerful nations so long accustomed to
</p>
<p>partake largely of French bounty, has of course increased the expense,
</p>
<p>and rendered it in no small degree necessary for the preservation of our
</p>
<p>frontiers, outposts, and trade. . . .
</p>
<p>Extract from a Letter  Cadwallader Colden to the Earl of Halitax,
</p>
<p>December 22, 1763 : 
</p>
<p>Before I proceed further, I think it proper to inform your Lordship of
</p>
<p>the different state of the Policy of the Five Nations in different periods
</p>
<p>of time. Before the peace of Utrecht, the Five Nations were at war
</p>
<p>with the French in Canada, and with all the Indian Nations who were in
</p>
<p>friendship with the French. This put the Five Nations under a necessity
</p>
<p>of depending on this province for a supply of every thing by which they
</p>
<p>could carry on the war or defend themselves, and their behavior towards
</p>
<p>us was accordingly.
</p>
<p>After the peace of Utrecht, the French changed their measures.
</p>
<p>They took every method in their power to gain the friendship of the
</p>
<p>Five Nations, and succeeded so far with the Senecas, who are by far the
</p>
<p>most numerous, and at the ereatest distance from us, that they were
</p>
<p>entirely brought over to the French interest. The French obtained the
</p>
<p>consent of the Senecas to the building of the Fort at Niagara, situated in
</p>
<p>their country.
</p>
<p>When tho French had too evidently, before the last war, got the
</p>
<p>ascendant arron^ all the Indian Nations, we endeavored to make the
</p>
<p>Indians jea'o^js of the French power, that they were thereby in danger

<p>of becominjj nUyes to th French, unless they were protected by the

<p>. . . The French, in order to reconcile them [the Indians] to their
</p>
<p>encroachments, loaded them with favors, and employed the most intelli-
</p>
<p>gent Agents of good influence, as well as artful Jesuits among the several
</p>
<p>Western and other Nations, who, by degrees, prevailed on them to admit
</p>
<p>of Forts, under the Notion of Trading houses, in their Country ; and
</p>
<p>knowing that these posts could never be maintained contrary to the incli-
</p>
<p>nations of the Indians, they supplied them thereat witii ammunition and
</p>
<p>other necessaries in abundance, as also called them to frequent congresses,
</p>
<p>and dismissed them with handsome presents, by which they enjoyed an
</p>
<p>extensive commerce, obtained the assistance of these Indians, and pos-
</p>
<p>sessed their frontiers in safety ; and as without these measures the Indiana
</p>
<p>would never have suffered them in their Country, so they expect that
</p>
<p>whatever European power possesses the same, they shall in some meaa-
</p>
<p>ure reap the like advantages. Now, as these advantages ceased on tha

<p>Posts being" possessed by the English, and especially as it was not thought
</p>
<p>prudent to indulge them with ammunition, they immediately concluded
</p>
<p>that we had designs against their liberties, which opinion had been first

<p>instilled into them by the French, and since promoted by Traders of that

<p>nation and others who retired among them on the surrender of Canada

<p>and are still there, as well as by Belts of Wampum and other exhortations,
</p>

<p>munieation of Fort Pitt, in the years 1759 and 1761, were easily induced
</p>
<p>to join with the Western Nations, and the Senecas, dissatisfied at many
</p>
<p>of our posts, jealous of our designs, and displeased at our neglect and
</p>
<p>contempt of them, soon followed their example.
</p>
<p>These are the causes the Indians themselves assign, and which cer-
</p>
<p>tainly occasioned the rupture between us, the consequence of which, in
</p>
<p>my opinion, will he that the Indians (who do not regard the distance) will
</p>
<p>be supplied with necessaries by the Wabache and several Rivers, which
</p>
<p>empty into the Mississippi, which it is by no means in our power to pre-
</p>
<p>vent, and in return the French will di-aw the^ valuable furs down that
</p>
<p>river to the advantage of their Colony and the destruction of our Trade ;
</p>
<p>this will always induce the French to foment ditferences between us and
</p>
<p>the Indians, and the prospects many of them entertain, that they may
</p>
<p>hereafter become possessed of Canada, will incline them still more to
</p>
<p>cultivate a good understanding with the Indians, which, if ever attempted
</p>
<p>by the French, would, I am very apprehensive, be attended with a gen-
</p>
<p>eral defection of them from our interest, unless we are at great pains and
</p>
<p>expense to regain their friendship, and thereby satisfy them that we have
</p>
<p>no designs to their prejudice. . . .
</p>
<p>The grand matter of concern to all the Six Nations (Mohawks
</p>
<p>excepted) is the occupying a chain of small Posts on the communication
</p>
<p>thro' their country to Lake Ontario, not to mention Fort Stanwix,
</p>
<p>exclusive of which there were erected in 1759 Fort Schuyler on the Mo-
</p>
<p>hawk River, and the Royal Blockhouse at the East end of Oneida Lake,
</p>
<p>in the Country of the Oneidas Fort Brewerton and a Post at Oswego
</p>
<p>Falls in the Onondagas Country ; in order to obtain permission for erect
</p>
<p>ing these posts, they were promised they should be demolished at the
</p>
<p>end of the war. General Shirley also made them a like promise for the
</p>
<p>posts he erected ; and as about these posts are their fishing and hunting
</p>
<p>places, where they complain, that they are often obstructed by the troops
</p>
<p>and insulted, they request that they may not be kept up, the war with
</p>
<p>the French being now over.
</p>
<p>In 1760, Sir Jeffrey Amherst sent a speech to the Indians in writing,
</p>
<p>which was to be communicated to the Nations about Fort Pitt, &c., by

<p>General Monkton, then commanding there, signifying his intentions to
</p>
<p>satisfy and content all Indians for the ground occupied by the posts, as
</p>
<p>also for any land about them, which might be found necessary for the use
</p>
<p>of the garrisons ; but the same has not been performed, neither are the
</p>
<p>Indians in the several countries at all pleased at our occupying them,
</p>
<p>which they look upon as the first steps to enslave them and invade their
</p>
<p>properties.
</p>
<p>And I beg leave to represent to your Lordships, that one very material
</p>
<p>advantage resulting from a continuance of good treatment and some
</p>
<p>favors to the Indians, will be the security and toleration thereby given to
</p>
<p>the Troops for cultivating lands about the garrisons, which the reduction

<p>PoNTBACH : OB THE Savages OP AMERICA. A Tragedy. London.
</p>
<p>Printed for the Author ; and Sold by J. Millan, opposite the Admi-
</p>
<p>ralty, WhitehaU. MDCCLXVI.
</p>
<p>The author of this tragedy was evidently a person well acquainted
</p>
<p>with Indian affairs and Indian character. Various allusions contained in
</p>
<p>it, as well as several peculiar forms of expression, indicate that Major
</p>
<p>Rogers had a share in its composition. The first act exhibits in detail the
</p>
<p>causes which led to the Indian war. The rest of the play is of a differ-
</p>
<p>ent character. The plot is sufficiently extravagant, and has little or no
</p>
<p>historical foundation. Chekitan, the son of Ponteach, is in love with
</p>
<p>Monelia, the daughter of Hendrick, Emperor of the Mohawks. MoneJia
</p>
<p>is murdered by Chekitan's brother Philip, partly out of revenge and jeal-
</p>
<p>ousy, and partly in furtherance of a scheme of policy. Chekitan kill*
</p>
<p>Philip, and then dies by his own hand ; and Ponteach, whose warriors
</p>
<p>meanwhile have been defeated by the English, overwhelmed by this
</p>
<p>accumulation of public and private calamities, retires to the forests of
</p>
<p>the west to escape the memory of his griefs. The style of the drama is
</p>
<p>superior to the plot, and the writer displays at times no small insight into
</p>
<p>the workings of human nature.
</p>
<p>The account of Indian wrongs and sufferings given in the first act
</p>
<p>accords so nearly with that conveyed in contemporary letters and docu-
</p>
<p>ments, that two scenes from this part of the play are here given, with a
</p>
<p>bw omissions, which good taste demands.

<p>"Which, faith, I find it hard enough to do ;

<p>Times are so dull, and Traders are so plenty,
</p>
<p>That Gains are small, and Profits come but slow.

<p>And how to make it lucrative and safe ?

</p>
<p>That drives at random, and must surely sink.

<p>And gladly would I learn the arts from you,

<p>Who're old, and practis'd in them many Yeara.

</p>
<p>A thousand Fools attempt to live tliis Way,
</p>
<p>Who might as well turn Ministers of State.
</p>
<p>But, as you are a Friend, I will inform you
</p>
<p>Of all the secret Arts by which we thrive,
</p>
<p>Which if all practis'd, we might all grow rich,
</p>
<p>Nor circumvent each other in our Gains.
</p>
<p>What have you got to part with to the Indians ?
</p>
<p>Murphey. I've Rum and Blankets, Wampum, Powder, Belkf
</p>
<p>And such like Trifles as they're wont to prize.
</p>
<p>M'Dole. 'Tis very well : your Articles are good :
</p>
<p>But now the Thing's to make a Profit from them,
</p>
<p>Worth all your Toil and Pains of coming hither.
</p>
<p>-Our fundamental Maxim then is this,
</p>
<p>That it's no Crime to cheat and gull an Indian.
</p>
<p>Murphey. How ! Not a Sin to cheat an Indian, say you '
</p>
<p>Are they not Men ? hav'nt they a Right to Justice
</p>
<p>As well as we, though savage in their Manners ?
</p>
<p>M'Dole. Ah ! If you boggle here, I say no more ;
</p>
<p>This is the very Quintessence of Trade,
</p>
<p>And ev'ry Hope of Gain depends upon it ;
</p>
<p>None who neglect it ever did grow rich.
</p>
<p>Or ever will, or can by Indian Commerce.
</p>
<p>By this old Ogden built his stately House,
</p>
<p>Purchased Estates, and grew a little King.
</p>
<p>He, like an honest Man, bought all by weight,
</p>
<p>And made the ign'rant Savages believe
</p>
<p>That his Right Foot exactly weighed a Pound.
</p>
<p>By this for many years he bought their Furs,
</p>
<p>And died in Quiet like an honest Dealer.
</p>
<p>Murphey. Well, I'll not stick at what is necesssry ;
</p>
<p>But his Devise is now grown old and stale.
</p>
<p>Nor could I manage such a barefac'd Fraud.

<p>DETROIT AND MICHILLIMACKINAC.
</p>
<p>1. The Siege op Detroit. (Chap. IX.-XV.;
</p>
<p>The authorities consulted respecting the siege of Detroit consist oi
</p>
<p>numerous manuscript letters of officers in the fort, including the official
</p>
<p>correspondence of the commanding officer ; of several journals and frag-
</p>
<p>ments of journals ; of extracts from contemporary newspapers ; and of
</p>
<p>traditions and recollections received from Indians or aged Canadian!
</p>
<p>of Detroit.
</p>
<p>The Pontiac Manuscript.
</p>
<p>This curious diary was preserved in a Canadian family at Detroit^
</p>
<p>and afterwards deposited with the Historical Society of Michigan. It is
</p>
<p>conjectured to have been the work of a French priest. The original is
</p>
<p>written in bad French, and several important parts are defaced or torn
</p>
<p>away. As a literary composition, it is quite worthless, being very diffuse
</p>
<p>and encumbered with dull and trivial details ; yet this very minuteness
</p>
<p>affords strong internal evidence of its authenticity. Its general exactness
</p>
<p>with respect to facts is fully proved by comparing it with contemporary
</p>
<p>documents. I am indebted to General Cass for the copy in my posses-
</p>
<p>sion, as well as for other papers respecting the war in the neighborhood
</p>
<p>of Detroit.
</p>
<p>The manuscript appears to have been elaborately written out from 
</p>
<p>rough journal kept during the progress of the events which it describes
</p>
<p>It commences somewhat ambitiously, as follows : 
</p>
<p>" Pondiac, great chief of all the Ottawas, Chippewas, and Pottawatta
</p>
<p>mies, and of all the nations of the lakes and rivers of the North, a man

</p>
<p>iieult which he thought he had received from Maj. Gladwin, Commandei
</p>
<p>)f the Fort, conceived that, being great chief of all the Northern nations,
</p>
<p>mly himself and those of his nations were entitled to inhabit this portion
</p>
<p>)f the earth, where for sixty and odd years the French had doraicihated
</p>
<p>for the purpose of trading, and where the English had governed during
</p>
<p>three years by right of the conquest of Canada. The Chief and all hia
</p>
<p>nation, whose bravery consists in treachery, resolved witliin himself the
</p>
<p>entire destruction of the English nation, and perhaps the Canadians. Iri
</p>
<p>order to succeed in his undertaking, which he had not mentioned to any
</p>
<p>of his nation the Ottawas, he engaged their aid by a speech, and they,
</p>
<p>naturally inclined to evil, did not hesitate to obey him. But, as they
</p>
<p>found themselves too weak to undertake the enterprise alone, their
</p>
<p>chief endeavored to draw to his party the Chippewa nation by means
</p>
<p>of a council. This nation was governed by a chief named Ninevois.
</p>
<p>This man, who acknowledged Pondiac as his chief, whose mind was weak,
</p>
<p>and whose disposition cruel, listened to his advances, and joined him with
</p>
<p>ill his band. These two nations consisted together of about four hun-
</p>
<p>dred men. This number did not appear to him suflBcient. It became
</p>
<p>necessary to bring into their interests the Hurons. This nation, divided
</p>
<p>into two bands, was governed by two different chiefs of dissimilar charac-
</p>
<p>ter, and nevertheless both led by their spiritual father, a Jesuit. The
</p>
<p>two chiefs of this last nation were named, one Takee, of a temper similar
</p>
<p>to Pondiac's, and the other Teata, a man of cautious disposition and of
</p>
<p>perfect prudence. This last was not easily won, and having no disposition
</p>
<p>to do evil, he refused to listen to the deputies sent by Pondiac, and sent
</p>
<p>them back. They therefore addressed themselves to the first-mentioned
</p>
<p>of this nation, by whom they were listened to, and from whom they
</p>
<p>received the war-belt, with promise to join themselves to Pondiac and
</p>
<p>Ninevois, the Ottawas and Chippewas chiefs. It was settled by means
</p>
<p>of wampum belts, (a manner of making themselves understood amongst
</p>
<p>distant savages,) that they should hold a council on the 27th of April,
</p>
<p>when should be decided the day and hour of the attack, and the precau-
</p>
<p>tions necessary to take in order that their perfidy should not be discovered.
</p>
<p>The manner of counting used by the Indians is by the moon ; and it was

<p>resolved in the way I have mentioned, that this council should be held on
</p>
<p>the 15th day of the moon, whicli corresponded with Wednesday the 27th
</p>
<p>of the month of April."
</p>
<p>The writer next describes the council at the River Ecorces, and recounts
</p>
<p>At full lengtl the story of the Delaware Indian who visited the Great
</p>
<p>Spirit. " The Chiefs," he says, " listened to Pondiac as to an oracle, and
</p>
<p>told him they were ready to do any thing he should require."
</p>
<p>He relates with great minuteness how Pontiac, with his chosen war-
</p>
<p>riors, came to the fort on the 1st of May, to dance the calumet dance,
</p>
<p>and observe the strength and disposition of the garrison, and describes
</p>
<p>the council subsequently held at the Pottawattamie village, in order to
</p>
<p>adjust the plan of attack.
</p>
<p>"The da} fished upon having arrived, all the Ottawas, Pondiac at

</p>
<p>their head, and the bad band of the Hurons, Takee at their head, met a1
</p>
<p>the Pottawattamie village, where the premeditated council was to be held
</p>
<p>Care was taken to send all the women out of the village, that they might
</p>
<p>not discover wliat was decided upon. Pondiac then ordered sentinels to
</p>
<p>be placed around the village, to prevent any interruption to their council.
</p>
<p>These precautions taken, each seated himself in the circle, according to
</p>
<p>hJ8 rank, and Pondiac, as great chief of the league, thus addressed them : 
</p>
<p>" It is important, my brothers, that we should exterminate from our
</p>
<p>land this nation, whose only object is our death. You must be all sensi-
</p>
<p>ble, as well as myself, that we can no longer supply our wants in the way
</p>
<p>we were accustomed to do with our Fathers the French. They sell us
</p>
<p>their goods at double the price that the French made us pay, and yet
</p>
<p>their merchandise is good for nothing ; for no sooner have we bought a
</p>
<p>blanket or other thing to cover us than it is necessary to procure others
</p>
<p>against the time of departing for our wintering ground. Neither will
</p>
<p>they let us have them on credit, as our brothers the French used to do.
</p>
<p>When I visit the English chief, and inform liim of the death of any ol
</p>
<p>our comrades, instead of lamenting, as our brothers the French used to
</p>
<p>do, they make game of us. If I ask him for any thing for our sick, he
</p>
<p>refuses, and tells us he does not want us, from which it is apparent he
</p>
<p>seeks our death. We must therefore, in return, destroy them without
</p>
<p>delay ; there is nothing to prevent us : there are but few of them, and
</p>
<p>we shall easily overcome them,  why should we not attack them ? Are
</p>
<p>we not men 1 Have I not shown you the belts I received from our
</p>
<p>Great Father the King of France ? He tells us to strike,  why shoulf"
</p>
<p>we not listen to his words 1 What do you fear ? The time has arrived
</p>
<p>Do you fear that our brothers the French, who are now among us, will
</p>
<p>hinder us ? They are not acquainted with our designs, and if they did
</p>
<p>know them, could they prevent them ? You know, as well as myself,
</p>
<p>that when the English came upon our lands, to drive from them our
</p>
<p>fether Bellestre, they took from the French all the guns that they have,
</p>
<p>so that they have now no guns to defend themselves with. Therefore
</p>
<p>now is the time : let us strike. Should there be any French to take their
</p>
<p>part, let us strike them as we do the Enghsh. Kemember what the Giver

<p>of Life desired our brother the Delaware to do : this regards us as much
</p>
<p>as it does them. I have sent belts and speeches to our friends the Chip-
</p>
<p>peways of Saginaw, and our brothers the Ottawas of Michillimacinac,
</p>
<p>and to those of the Riviere A la Tranche, (Thames River,) inviting them
</p>
<p>to join us, and they will not delay. In the mean time, let us strike.
</p>
<p>There is no longer any time to lose, and when the Enghsh shall bo
</p>
<p>defeated, we wiU stop the way, so that no more shall return upon our

</p>
<p>" This discourse, which Pondiac delivered in a tone of much energy,
</p>
<p>had upDn the whole council all the effect which he could have expected,
</p>
<p>and they all, with common accord, swore the entire destruction of the
</p>
<p>Enghsh nation.
</p>
<p>" At the breaking up of the council, it was decided that Pondiac, with
</p>
<p>i\PPENDIX C. e>31
</p>
<p>iixty chosen men, should go to the Fort to ask for a grrancl council froni
</p>
<p>the English commander, and that they should have arms concealed under
</p>
<p>their blajikets. That the remainder of tlie village sliould follow them
</p>
<p>armed with tomaliawks, daggers, and knives, concealed under their
</p>
<p>blankets, and should enter the Fort, and walk about in such a manner as
</p>
<p>not to excite suspicion, whilst tlie others held council with the Com-
</p>
<p>mander. The Ottawa women were also to be furnished with short guns and
</p>
<p>other oflfensive weapons concealed under tlieir blankets. They were to
</p>
<p>go into the back streets in the Fort. They were then to wait for the
</p>
<p>signal agreed upon, which was the cry of death, which the Grand Chief
</p>
<p>was to give, on which they should altogether strike upon the English,
</p>
<p>taking care not to hurt any of the Frencli inhabiting the Fort."
</p>
<p>The author of the diary, unlike other contemporary writers, states
</p>
<p>lliat tlie plot was disclosed to Gladwyn by a man of the Ottawa tribe, and
</p>
<p>not by an Ojibwa girl. He says, however, that on the day after the fail
</p>
<p>ore of the design Pontiac sent to the Pottawattamie village in order to
</p>
<p>seize an Ojibwa girl whom he suspected of having betrayed liim.
</p>
<p>"Pondiac ordered four Indians to take her and bring her before him ;
</p>
<p>these men, naturally inclined to disorder, were not long in obeying their
</p>
<p>chief; they crossed the river immediately in front of their village, and
</p>
<p>passed into the Fort naked, having nothing but their breech-clouts on and
</p>
<p>their knives in their hands, and crying all the way that their plan had
</p>
<p>been defeated, which induced the French people of the Fort, who knew
</p>
<p>nothing of the designs of the Indians, to susi)ect that some bad design
</p>
<p>was going forward, either against themselves or the English. They
</p>
<p>arrived at the Pottawattamie village, and in fact found the woman, who
</p>
<p>was far from thinking of them ; nevertheless they seized her, and obhged
</p>
<p>her to march before them, uttering cries of joy in the manner they do
</p>
<p>when they hold a victim in tlieir clutches on whom they are going to
</p>
<p>exercise their cruelty : they made her enter the Fort, and took her before
</p>
<p>the Commandant, as if to confront her with him, and asked him if it was
</p>
<p>not from her he had learnt their design ; but they were no better satisfied
</p>
<p>than if they had kept themselves quiet. They obtained from that Officer
</p>
<p>bread and beer for themselves, and for her. They then led her to their

<p>chief in the village."
</p>
<p>The diary leaves us in the dark as to the treatment which the girl
</p>
<p>received ; but there is a tradition among the Canadians that Pontiac, wim
</p>
<p>his own hand, gave her a severe beating with a species of racket, such as
</p>
<p>the Indians use in their ball-play. An old Indian told Henry Conner, for-
</p>
<p>merly United States interpreter at Detroit, that she survived her punish-
</p>
<p>ment, and lived for many years ; but at length, contracting intemperate
</p>
<p>habits, she fell, when intoxicated, into a kettle of boiling maple sap, and
</p>
<p>was so severely scalded that she died in consequence.
</p>
<p>The outbreak of hostilities, the attack on the fort, and the detention
</p>
<p>of Campbell and JNlcDougal are related at great length, and with all the
</p>
<p>minuteness of an eye-witness. The substance of the narrative is incor-

</p>
<p>Here it breaks off abruptly in the middle of a sentence, the remaining pan
</p>
<p>having been lost or torn away. The following extracts, taken at random
</p>
<p>will serve to indicate the general style and character of the journal : 
</p>
<p>" Saturday, June 4th. About 4 P. M. cries of death were heard fron
</p>
<p>the Indians. The cause was not known, but it was supposed they had
</p>
<p>obtained some prize on the Lake.
</p>
<p>" Sunday, June 5tli. The Indians fired a few shots upon the Fort to-
</p>
<p>day. About 2 P. M. cries of death were again heard on the opposite aids
</p>
<p>of the River. A number of Indians were descried, part on foot and pait
</p>
<p>mounted. Others were taking up two trading boats, which they had
</p>
<p>taken on the lake. The vessel fired several shots at them, hoping
</p>
<p>they would abandon their prey, but they reached Pondiac's camp
</p>
<p>uninjured. . . .
</p>
<p>"About 7 P. M news came that a number of Indians had gone down
</p>
<p>as far as Turkey Island, opposite the small vessel which was anchored
</p>
<p>there, but that, on seeing them, she had dropped down into the open Lake
</p>
<p>to wait for a fair wind to come up the river.
</p>
<p>"Monday, June 20th. The Indians fired some shots upon the fort.
</p>
<p>About 4 P. M. news was brought that Presquisle and Beef River Forts,
</p>
<p>which had been established by the Frencli, and were now occupied by the
</p>
<p>English, had been destroyed by the Indians. . . .
</p>
<p>*' Wednesday, June 22d. The Indians, whose wliole attention was
</p>
<p>directed to the vessel, did not trouble the Fort. In the course of the day,
</p>
<p>the news of the taking of Presquisle was confirmed, as a great number
</p>
<p>of the Indians were seen coming along the shore with prisoners. The
</p>
<p>Commandant w^as among the number, and with him one woman : both
</p>
<p>were presented to the Hurons. In the afternoon, the Commandant
</p>
<p>received news of the lading of the vessel, and the number of men on
</p>
<p>board. The Indians again visited the French for provisions.
</p>
<p>" Thursday, June 23d. Very early in the morning, a great 'number
</p>
<p>of Indians were seen passing behind the Fort : they joined those below,
</p>
<p>and all repaired to Turkey Island. The river at this place is very nar-
</p>
<p>row. The Indians commenced making intrenchments of trees, &,c., on

</p>
<p>the beach, where the vessel was to pass, whose arrival they awaited.
</p>
<p>About ten of the preceding night, the wind coming aft, the vessel weighed
</p>
<p>anchor, and came uj) the river. When opposite the Island the wind fell,
</p>
<p>and they were oblige! to throw the anchor; as they knew they could not
</p>
<p>reach the Fort without being attacked by the Indians, they kept a strict
</p>
<p>watch. In order to deceive the Indians, the captain had hid in the hold
</p>
<p>sixty of liis men, suspecting that the Indians, seeing only about a dozen
</p>
<p>men on deck, would try to take the vessel, which occurred as he expected.
</p>
<p>About 9 at night they got in their canoes, and made for the vessel, intending
</p>
<p>to board her. They were seen far off by one of the sentinels. The cap-
</p>
<p>tain immediately ordered up all his men in the greatest silence, and placed
</p>
<p>them along the sides of the vessel, with their guns in their hands, loaded,
</p>
<p>with orders to wait the signal for firing, which wa* the rap of a . hammei

</p>
<p>on the mast. The Indians were allowed to approach within less than
</p>
<p>gunshot when the signal was given, and a discharge of cannon and small
</p>
<p>arms made upon them. They retreated to their intrenchment with the
</p>
<p>loss of fourteen killed and fourteen wounded ; from which they fired dur
</p>
<p>ing the night, and wounded two men. In the morning the vessel dropped
</p>
<p>down to the Lake for a more favorable wind.
</p>
<p>" Friday, June 24th. The Indians were occupied with the vessoL
</p>
<p>Two Indians back of the Fort were pursued by twenty men, and escaped,
</p>
<p>" Saturday, June 25th. Nothing occurred this day.
</p>
<p>" Sunday, June 26th. Nothing of consequence.
</p>
<p>" Monday, June 27th. Mr. Gamelin, who was in the practice of visit-
</p>
<p>ing Messrs. Campbell and McDougall, brought a letter to the Commandant
</p>
<p>from Mr. Cami)bell, dictated by Pondiac, in which he requested the Com-
</p>
<p>mandant to surrender the Fort, as in a few days he expected Kee-no-cha-
</p>
<p>meck, great chief of the Cliippewas, with eight hundred men of his
</p>
<p>nation ; that he (Pondiac) would not then be able to command them, and
</p>
<p>as soon as they arrived, they would scalp all the English in the Fort. The
</p>
<p>Commandant only answered that he cared as little for him as he did for
</p>
<p>them. . . .
</p>
<p>" This evening, the Commandant was informed that the Ottawas and
</p>
<p>Chippewas had undertaken another raft, which might be more worthy oi
</p>
<p>attention than the former ones : it was reported to be of pine boards, and
</p>
<p>intended to be long enougli to go across the river. By setting fire to every
</p>
<p>part of it, it could not help, by its length, coming in contact with the
</p>
<p>vessel, which by this means they expected would certainly take fire
</p>
<p>Some firing took place between the vessel and Indians, but without eflTect
</p>
<p>" Tuesday, July 19th. The Indians attempted to fire on the Fort,
</p>
<p>but being discovered, they were soon made to retreat by a few shot.
</p>
<p>" Wednesday, July 20th. Confirmation came to the Fort of the report
</p>
<p>of the 18th, and that the Indians had been four days at work at their
</p>
<p>raft, and that it w^ould take eight more to finish it. The Commandant
</p>
<p>ordered that two boats should be lined or clapboarded with oak plank,
</p>
<p>two inches thick, and the same defence to be raised above the gunnels of
</p>
<p>the boats of two feet high. A swivel was put on each of them, and placed

</p>
<p>in such a way that they could be pointed in three diflTerent directions.
</p>
<p>" Thursday, July 21st. The Indians were too busily occupied to pay
</p>
<p>any attention to the Fort ; so earnest were they in the work of the raft
</p>
<p>tnat they hardly allowed themselves time to eat. The Commandant
</p>
<p>farther availed himself of the titne allowed him before the premeditated
</p>
<p>attack to put every thing in proper order to repulse it. He ordered that
</p>
<p>two strong graplins should be provided for each of the barges, a strong
</p>
<p>iron chain of fifteen feet was to be attached to the boat, and conducting a
</p>
<p>strong cable under water, fastened to the graplins, and the boats were
</p>
<p>intended to be so disposed as to cover the vessel, by mooring them, by the
</p>
<p>help of the above preparations, above her. The inhabitants of the S. W.
</p>
<p>ridge, or hill, again got a false alarm. It was said the Indians intended
</p>
<p>attacking them during the night : they kept on their guard till morning.
</p>

</p>
<p>" Friday, July 22d. An Abenakee Indian arrived this day, saying
</p>
<p>that he came direct from Montreal, and gave out that a lartre fleet of
</p>
<p>French was on its way to Canada, full of troops, to dispossess the Enghsh
</p>
<p>of the country. However fallacious such a story might ap{)ear, it had the
</p>
<p>effect of rousing Pondiac from his inaction, and the Indians set about
</p>
<p>their raft with more energy than ever. They had left off working at it
</p>
<p>since yesterday." . . .
</p>
<p>It is needless to continue these extracts farther. Those already given
</p>
<p>will cjonvey a sufficient idea of the character of the diary.
</p>
<p>REMINISCENCES OF AGED CANADIANS.
</p>
<p>About the year 1824, General Cass, with the design of writing a nar
</p>
<p>native of the siege of Detroit by Pontiac, caused inquiry to be made
</p>
<p>among the aged Canadian inhabitants, many of whom could distinctly
</p>
<p>remember the events of 1763. The accounts received from them were
</p>
<p>committed to paper, and were placed by General Cass, with great liber-
</p>
<p>ality, in the writer's hands. They affbrd an interesting mass of evidence,
</p>
<p>as worthy of confidence as evidence of the kind can be. With but one
</p>
<p>exception,  the account of Maxwell,  they do not clash with the testi-
</p>
<p>mony of contemporary documents. Much caution has, however, been
</p>
<p>observed in their use ; and no essential statement has been made on their
</p>
<p>unsupported authority. The most prominent of these accounts are those
</p>
<p>of Peltier, St. Aubin, Gouin, Meloche, Parent, and Maxwell
</p>
<p>Peltier's Account.
</p>
<p>M. Peltier was seventeen years old at tlie time of Pontiac's war. Hi
</p>
<p>narrative, though one of the longest of the collection, is imperfect, since,
</p>
<p>during a great part of the siege, he was absent from Detroit in search cf

<p>runaway horses, belonging to his father. His recollection of the earlier

<p>part of the affair is, however, clear and minute. He relates, with apparer t

<p>creduHty, the story of the hand of the murdered Fisher protruding from
</p>
<p>the earth, as if in supplication for the neglected rites of burial. He re-

<p>members that, soon after the failure of Pontiac's attempt to surprise tlie

<p>garrison, he punished, by a severe flogging, a woman named Catharine,

<p>accused of having betrayed the plot. He was at Detroit during the

<p>St. Aubin's Account.
</p>
<p>1st. Aubin was fifteen years old at the time of the siege. It was hii
</p>
<p>mother who crossed over to Pontiac's village shortly before the attempt
</p>
<p>AITENDIX ^. 335
</p>
<p>on the garrison, and discoA-^ered the Indians in the act of sawing off the
</p>
<p>muzzles of their uuiis, as related in the narrative. He remembers Pon-
</p>
<p>tiac at his headquarters, at the house of Meloche; where his commis.
</p>
<p>Baries served out provision to the Indians. He himself was among those
</p>
<p>who conveyed cattle across the river to the English, at a time when they
</p>
<p>were threateiK-d with starvation. One of his most vivid recollections la
</p>
<p>that of seeing the head of Captain Dalzell stuck on the picket of a garden
</p>
<p>fence, on the day after the battle of Bloody Bridge. His narrative is on
</p>
<p>of the most copious and authentic of the series
</p>
<p>GouiN*s Account.
</p>
<p>M. Gouin was but eleven years old at the time of the war. His father
</p>
<p>was a prominent trader, and had great influence over the Indians. On
</p>
<p>several occasions, he acted as medi.i.or between them and the English;
</p>
<p>and when Major Campbell was bent on visiting the camp of Pontiac, the
</p>
<p>elder Gouin strenuously endeavored to prevent the attempt. Pontiac
</p>
<p>often came to him for advice. His son bears emphatic testimony to the
</p>
<p>extraordinary control which the chief exercised over his followers, and to
</p>
<p>the address which he displayed in the management of his commissary
</p>
<p>department. This account contains many particulars not elsewhere men-
</p>
<p>tioned, though bearing all the appearance of truth. It appears to have
</p>
<p>been composed partly from the recollections of the younger Gouin, and
</p>
<p>partly from information derived from his father.
</p>
<p>Meloche's Account.
</p>
<p>Mad. Meloche lived, when a child, on the borders of the Detroit, be
</p>
<p>tween the river and the camp of Pontiac. On one occasion, when the
</p>
<p>English were cannonading the camp from their armed schooner in the
</p>
<p>river, a shot struck her father's house, throwing down a part of the walla.
</p>
<p>After the death of Major Campbell, she picked up a pocket-book belong-
</p>
<p>ing to him, which the Indians had left on the ground. It was fiill of
</p>
<p>papers, and she carried it to the English in the fort.
</p>
<p>Parent's Account.
</p>
<p>M. Parent was twenty-two years old when the war broke out. ITit
</p>
<p>recollections of the siege are, however, less exact than those of some
</p>
<p>of the former witnesses, though his narrative preserves several Inter-

</p>
<p>Maxwell's Account.
</p>
<p>Maxwell was an English provincial, and pretended to have been a
</p>
<p>aoldier under Gladwyn. His story belies the statement. It has all the /
</p>
<p>air of a narrative made up from hearsay, and largely embellished from /
</p>
<p>imag-ination. It has been made use of only in a few instances, where it l

</p>
<p>336 APPENDIX C.
</p>
<p>Rmply supported by less questionable evidence. This account seems to
</p>
<p>have been committed to paper by Maxwell himself, as the style is very
</p>
<p>rude and illiterate.
</p>
<p>The remaining manuscripts consulted with reference to the siege of
</p>
<p>Detroit have been obtained from the State Paper Office of London, and
</p>
<p>from a few private autograph collections. Some additional information
</p>
<p>has been derived from the columns of the New York Mercurj^ and the
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Gazette for 1763, where various letters written by officers
</p>
<p>at Detroit are published.
</p>
<p>2. The Massacre of Michillimackinac. (Chap. XVII.)
</p>
<p>The following letter may be regarded with interest, as having been
</p>
<p>written by the commander of the unfortunate garrison a few days after
</p>
<p>the massacre. A copy of the original was procured from the State
</p>
<p>Paper Office of London.
</p>
<p>MicMllimackinac, 12 June, 1763.
</p>
<p>Sir:
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding that I wrote you in my last, that all the savages were
</p>
<p>arrived, and that every thing seemed in perfect tranquiUity, yet, on the
</p>
<p>2d instant, the Chippewas, who live in a plain near this fort, assembled
</p>
<p>to play ball, as they had done almost every day since their arrival. They
</p>
<p>played from morning till noon ; then throwing their ball close to the gate,
</p>
<p>and observing Lieut. Lesley and me a few paces out of it, they came
</p>
<p>behind us, seized and carried us into the woods.
</p>
<p>In the mean time the rest rushed into the Fort, where they found
</p>
<p>their squaws, whom they had previously planted there, with their hatchets
</p>
<p>hid under their blankets, which they took, and in an instant killed Lieut.
</p>
<p>Jamet and fifteen rank and file, and a trader named Tracy. They
</p>
<p>wounded two, and took the rest of the garrison prisoners, five [seven,
</p>
<p>Henry] of whom they have since killed.
</p>
<p>They made prisoners all the English Traders, and robbed them of
</p>
<p>every thing they had ; but they ofiered no violence to the persons or
</p>
<p>property of any of the Frenchmen.
</p>
<p>When that massacre was over, Messrs. Langlade and Farli, the Inter-
</p>
<p>preter, came down to the place where Lieut. Lesley and me were

</p>
<p>prisoners ; and on their giving themselves as security to return us when
</p>
<p>demanded, they obtained leave for us to go to the Fort, under a guard of
</p>
<p>savages, which gave time, by the assistance of the gentlemen above-men-
</p>
<p>tioned, to send for the Outaways, who came down on the first notice, and
</p>
<p>were very much displeased at what the Chippeways had done.
</p>
<p>Since the arrival of the Outaways they have done every thing in their
</p>
<p>power to serve us, and with what prisoners the Chippeways had given
</p>
<p>them, and what they have bought, I have now with me Lieut. Lesley
</p>
<p>and eleven privates ; and the other four of the Garrison, who are yet
</p>
<p>living, remain in the hands of the Chippeways.
</p>
<p>APPENDIX C. 337
</p>
<p>The Chippeways, who are superior in number to the Ottaways, have
</p>
<p>declared in Council to them that if they do not remove us out of the Fort,
</p>
<p>they will cut oti' all communication to this Post, by which means all the
</p>
<p>Convoys of Merchants from Montreal, La Baye, St. Joseph, and the
</p>
<p>upper posts, would perish. But if the news of your posts being attacked
</p>
<p>(which they say was the reason why they took up the hatchet) be false, and
</p>
<p>you can send up a strong reinforcement, with provisions, &c., accompanied
</p>
<p>by some of your savages, I believe the post might be re-established
</p>
<p>again.
</p>
<p>Since this affair happened, two canoes arrived from Montreal, which
</p>
<p>put in my power to make a present to the Ottaway nation, who very well
</p>
<p>deserve any thing that can be done for them.
</p>
<p>I have been very much obliged to Messrs. Langlade and Parli, the
</p>
<p>Interpreter, as likewise to the Jesuit, for the many good offices they
</p>
<p>have done us on this occasion. The Priest seems inclinable to go down
</p>
<p>to your post for a day or two, which I am very glad of, as he is a
</p>
<p>very good man, and had a great deal to say with the savages, hereabout,
</p>
<p>who will believe every thing he tells them on his return, which I hope
</p>
<p>will be soon. The Cutaways say they will take Lieut. Lesley, me,
</p>
<p>and the Eleven men which I mentioned before were in their hands, up
</p>
<p>to their village, and there keep us, till they hear what is doing at your
</p>
<p>Post. They have sent this canot for that purpose.
</p>
<p>I refer you to the Priest for the particulars of this mel&ncholy affair
</p>
<p>and am, Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,
</p>
<p>[Signed] Geo. Etherinoton
</p>
<p>To Major Gladwtn.
</p>
<p>P. S. The Indians that are to carry the Priest to Detroit will not under-
</p>
<p>take to land him at the Fort, but at some of the Indian villages near
</p>
<p>it; so you must not take it amiss that he does not pay you the first
</p>
<p>visit. And once more I beg that nothing may stop your sending of him
</p>
<p>back, the next day after his arrival, if possible, as we shall be at a great
</p>
<p>loss for the want of him, and I make no doubt that you will do all in your
</p>
<p>power to make peace, as you see the situation we are in, and send up

<p>THE WAR ON THE BORDEKS.
</p>
<p>The Battle of Bushy Run. (Chap. XX.)
</p>
<p>The despatches written by Colonel Bouquet, immediately after th
</p>
<p>two battles near Bushy Run, contain so full and clear an account of those
</p>
<p>engagements, that the collateral authorities consulted have served rather
</p>
<p>to decorate and enliven the narrative than to add to it any important facts.
</p>
<p>The first of these letters was written by Bouquet under the apprehension
</p>
<p>tliat he should not survive the expected conflict of the next day. Both
</p>
<p>were forwarded to the commander-in-cliief by the same express, within a
</p>
<p>few days after the victory. The letters as here given were copied from
</p>
<p>the originals in the London offices.
</p>
<p>Camp at Edge Hill, 26 Miles from )
</p>
<p>Fort Pitt, 5th August, 1763. )
</p>
<p>Sir:
</p>
<p>The Second Instant the Troops and Convoy Arrived at Ligonier,
</p>
<p>whence I could obtain no Intelligence of the Enemy ; The Expresses
</p>
<p>Sent since the beginning of July, having been Either killed, or Obliged
</p>
<p>to Return, all the Passes being Occupied by the Enemy : In this uncer-
</p>
<p>tainty I Determined to Leave all the Waggons with the Powder, and a
</p>
<p>Quantity of Stores and Provisions, at Ligonier ; And on the 4th pro
</p>
<p>ceeded with the Troops, and about 350 Horses Loaded with Flour.
</p>
<p>I Intended to have Halted to Day at Bushy Run, (a Mile beyond this
</p>
<p>Camp,) and after having Refreshed the Men and Horses, to have Marched
</p>
<p>in the Night over Turtle Creek, a very Dangerous Defde of Sevtral
</p>
<p>Miles, Commanded by High and Craggy Hills : But at one o'clock this
</p>
<p>Afternoon, after a march of 17 JNIiles, the Savages suddenly Attacked our
</p>
<p>Advanced Guard, wliicli was immediately Supported by the two Light
</p>
<p>Infantry Companies of the 42d Regiment, Who Drove the Enemy from
</p>
<p>their Ambuscade, and pursued them a good Way. The Savages Returned
</p>
<p>to the Attack, and the Fire being Obstinate on our Front, and Extending
</p>
<p>along our Flanks, We made a General Charge, with the whole Line, to
</p>
<p>Dislodge the Savages from the Heights, in which attempt We succeeded

</p>
<p>without Obtaining by it any Decisive Advantage ; for as soon as they
</p>
<p>APPENDIX D. 339
</p>
<p>ere driven from One Post, they Appeared on Another, 'till, by continual
</p>
<p>Reinforcements, they were at last able to Surround Us, and attacked the
</p>
<p>Convoy left in our Rear ; This Obliged us to March Back to protect it ;
</p>
<p>The Action then became General, and though we were attacked on Every
</p>
<p>Side, and the Savages Exerted themselves with Uncommon Kesolution,
</p>
<p>they were constantly Kepulsed with Loss.  We also Suflered Consider-
</p>
<p>ably : Capt. Lieut. Graham, and Lieut. James Mcintosh of the 42d,
</p>
<p>are Rilled, and Capt. Graham Wounded.
</p>
<p>Of the Royal Amer'n Regt., Lieut. Dow, who acted as A. D. Q. M
</p>
<p>G. is shot througli the Body.
</p>
<p>Of the 77th, Lieut. Donald Campbell, and Mr. Peebles, a Volunteei
</p>
<p>are Wounded.
</p>
<p>Our Loss in INIen, Including Rangers, and Drivers, Exceeds Sixty,
</p>
<p>Killed or Wounded.
</p>
<p>The Action lias Lasted from One O'Clock 'till Night, And We Expect
</p>
<p>to Begin again at Day Break. Whatever Our Fate may be, I thought it
</p>
<p>necessary to Give Your Excellency this Early Information, that Ycu
</p>
<p>may, at all Events, take such Measures as You will think proper with the
</p>
<p>Provinces, for their own Safety, and the Effectua! Relief of Fort Pitt, as
</p>
<p>in Case of Another Engagement I Fear Insurmountable Difficulties in
</p>
<p>protecting and Transporting our Provisions, being already so much
</p>
<p>Weakened by the Losses of this Day, in Men and Horses ; besides the
</p>
<p>Additional Necessity of Carrying the Wounded, Whose Situation is truly
</p>
<p>Deplorable.
</p>
<p>I Cannot Sufficiently Acknowledge the Constant Assistance I have
</p>
<p>Received from Major Campbell, during this long Action ; Nor Express
</p>
<p>my Admiration of the Cool and Steady Behavior of the Troops, Who
</p>
<p>Did not Fire a Shot, without Orders, and Drove the Enemy from their
</p>
<p>Posts with Fixed Bayonets.  The Conduct of the Officers is much abova
</p>
<p>my Praises.

<p>I Have the

<p>Honor to be, with great Respect,

</p>
<p>Camp at Bushy Run, 6th August, 17G3.
</p>
<p>Sir
</p>
<p>I Had the Honor to Inform Your Excellency in my letter of Yesterday
</p>
<p>of our first Engagement with the Savages.
</p>
<p>We Took Post last Night on the Hill, where Our Convoy Halted,
</p>
<p>when the Front was Attacked, (a commodious piece of Ground, and Just
</p>
<p>Spacious Enough for our Purpose.) There We Encircled the Whole, and
</p>
<p>Covered our Wounded with the Flour Bags.
</p>
<p>In the Morning the Savages Surrounded our Camp, at the Distance
</p>
<p>of about 500 Yards, and by Shouting and Yelping, quite Round that Ex
</p>
<p>tensive Circumference, thought to have Terrified Us, with their Numbers
</p>
<p>MO APPENDIX D.
</p>
<p>They Attacked Us Early, and, under Favour of an Incessant Fire, made
</p>
<p>Several Bold Efforts to Penetrate our Camp ; And tho' they Failed in the
</p>
<p>Attempt, our Situation was not the Less Perplexing, having Experienced
</p>
<p>that Brisk Attacks had Little Effect upon an Enemy, who always gave
</p>
<p>Way when Pressed, & Appeared again Immediately ; Our Troops were
</p>
<p>besides Extreme)}' Fatigued with the Long March, and as long Action of .
</p>
<p>the Preceding Day, and Distressed to the Last Degree, by a Total Want
</p>
<p>of Water, much more Intolerable than the Enemy's Fire.
</p>
<p>Tied to our Convoy We could not Lose Sight of it, without Exposing
</p>
<p>it, and our Wounded, to Fall a prey to the Savages, who Pressed upon
</p>
<p>Us on Every Side ; and to Move it was Impracticable, having lost many
</p>
<p>horses, and most of the Drivers, Stnpified by Fear, hid themselves in the
</p>
<p>Bushes, or were Incapable of Hearing or Obeying Orders.
</p>
<p>The Savages growing Every Moment more Audacious, it was thought
</p>
<p>proper still to increase their Confidence ; by that means, if possible, to
</p>
<p>Entice them to Come Close upon Us, or to Stand their Ground when
</p>
<p>Attacked. With this View two Companies of Light Infantry were
</p>
<p>Ordered within the Circle, and the Troops on their Right and Left opened
</p>
<p>their Files, and Filled up the Space that it might seem they were intended
</p>
<p>to Cover the Retreat; The Third Light Infantry Company, and the
</p>
<p>Grenadiers of the 42d, were Ordered to Support the two First Companys.
</p>
<p>This Manoeuvre Succeeded to Our Wish, for the Few Troops who Took
</p>
<p>possession of the Ground lately Occupied by the two Light Infantry Com
</p>
<p>panys being Brought in Nearer to the Centre of the Circle, the Barbarians,
</p>
<p>mistaking these Motions for a Retreat, Hurried Headlong on, and Advanc
</p>
<p>ing upon Us, with the most Daring Intrepidity, Galled us Excessively
</p>
<p>with their Heavy Fire ; But at the very moment that, Certain of Success,
</p>
<p>they thought themselves Masters of the Camp, Major Campbell, at the
</p>
<p>Head of the two First Companys, Sallied out from a part of the Hill they
</p>
<p>Could not Observe, and Fell upon their Right Flank ; They Resolutely
</p>
<p>Returned the Fire, but could not Stand the Irresistible Shock of our Men,
</p>
<p>Who, Rushing in among them, Killed many of them, and Put the Rest
</p>
<p>to Flight. The Orders sent to the Other Two Companys were Delivered
</p>
<p>BO timely by Captain Basset, and Executed with such Celerity and Spirit,

<p>that the Routed Savages, who happened to Run that Moment before their
</p>
<p>Front, Received their Full Fire, when Uncovered by the Trees : The
</p>
<p>Four Companys Did not give them time to Load a Second time, nor
</p>
<p>Kven to Look behind them, but Pursued them 'till they were Totally
</p>
<p>Dispersed. The Left of the Savages, which had not been Attacked,
</p>
<p>were kept in Awe by the Remains of our Troops, Posted on the Brow of
</p>
<p>the Hill, for that Purpose ; Nor Durst they Attempt to Support, or Assist
</p>
<p>their Right, but being Witness to their Defeat, followed their Example
</p>
<p>and Fled. Our Brave Men Disdained so much to Touch the Dead Body
</p>
<p>of a Vanquislied Enemy, that Scarce a Scalp was taken, Except by
</p>
<p>the Rangers, and Pack Horse Drivers.
</p>
<p>The Woods being now Cleared and the Pursuit over, the Four Com-
</p>
<p>panys took possession of a Hill in our Front ; and as soon as Litters could
</p>
<p>APPENDIX D. 311
</p>
<p>be made for the Wounded, and the Flour and Every thing Destroyed,
</p>
<p>wliich, for want of Horses, could not be Carried, We Marclied without
</p>
<p>Molestation to this Camp. After the Severe Correction We had given
</p>
<p>the Savages a few hours before, it was Natural to Suppose We sliould
</p>
<p>Enjoy some Rest ; but We had hardly Fixed our Camp, when they fired
</p>
<p>upon Us again : This was very Provoking ! llowever, the Light Infantry
</p>
<p>Dispersed them, before they could Receive Orders for that purpose.  I
</p>
<p>Hope We shall be no more Disturbed, for, if We have another Action,
</p>
<p>We shall hardly be able to Carry our Wounded.
</p>
<p>The Behavior of the Troops, on this Occasion, Speaks for itself so
</p>
<p>Strongly, that for me to Attempt their Eulogium, would but Detract from
</p>
<p>their merit.
</p>
<p>I Have the Honor to be, most Respectfully,
</p>
<p>Sir,
</p>
<p>&ca.
</p>
<p>Henry Bouquet.
</p>
<p>P, S. I Have the Honor to Enclose the Return of the Killed, Woimded,
</p>
<p>and Missing in the two Engagements.

<p>1. ETiDENCB AGAINST THE INDIANS OF CONESTOGA. (Chap. XXIVj
</p>
<p>Abraham Newcomer, a Mennonist, by trade a Gunsmith, upon hia
</p>
<p>aflirmation, declared that several times, within these few years, Bill Soc
</p>
<p>and Indian John, two of the Conestogue Indians, threatened to scalp him
</p>
<p>sbr refusing to mend their tomahawks, and swore they would as soon scalp
</p>
<p>nim as they would a dog. A few days before Bill Soc was killed, he
</p>
<p>brought a tomaliawk to be steeled. Bill said, " K you will not, I'll have
</p>
<p>it mended to your sorrow," from which expression I apprehended danger.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Thompson, of the borough of Lancaster, personally appeared
</p>
<p>before the Chief Burgess, and upon her solemn oath, on the Holy Evan-
</p>
<p>gelists, said that in the summer of 1761, Bill Soc came to her apartment,
</p>
<p>and tlu-eatened her life, saying, " I kill you, all Lancaster can't catch me,"
</p>
<p>which filled me with terror ; and this lady further said. Bill Soc added,
</p>
<p>" Lancaster is mine, and I will have it yet."
</p>
<p>Colonel John Hambright, gentleman, an eminent Brewer of the Borough
</p>
<p>of Lancaster, personally appeared before Kobert Thompson, Esq., a jus-
</p>
<p>tice for the county of Lancaster, and made oath on the Holy Evangelists,
</p>
<p>that, in August, 1757, he, an officer, was sent for provision from Fort
</p>
<p>Augusta to Eort Hunter, that on his way he rested at M'Kee's old place ,
</p>
<p>a Sentinel was stationed behind a tree, to prevent surprise. The Sentry

<p>gave notice Indians were near ; the deponent crawled up the bank and

<p>discovered two Indians ; one was Bill Soc, lately killed at Lancaster. He

<p>called Bill Soc to come to him, but the Indians ran oflf. When the depo-
</p>
<p>nent came to Fort Hunter, he learnt that an old man had been killed the
</p>
<p>Jay before ; Bill Soc and his companion were believed to be the perpe-
</p>
<p>trators of the murder. He, the deponent, had frequently seen Bill Soc
</p>
<p>and some of the Conestogue Indians at Fort Augusta, trading with the
</p>
<p>Indians, but, after the murder of the old man. Bill Soc did not appear at

<p>told him that the Conestogue Indians had killed Jegrea, an Indian, because

<p>Deposition of Felix Donolly, keeper of Lancaster Jail.

<p>This deposition is imperfect, a part of the manuscript having been
</p>
<p>defaced or torn away. The original, in the handwriting of Edward Ship-
</p>
<p>pen, the chief magistrate of Lancaster, was a few years since in the pes*
</p>
<p>session of Redmond Conyngham, Esq.
</p>
<p>The breaking open the door alarmed me ; armed men broke in ; they
</p>
<p>demanded the strange Indian to be given up ; they ran by me ; the Indiana

</p>
<p>guessed their intention ; they seized billets of wood from the pile ; but
</p>
<p>the three most active were shot ; others came to their assistance ; I wa?
</p>
<p>stupefied; before I could shake off my surprise, the Indiana were killed
</p>
<p>and their murderers away.
</p>
<p>Q. You say, " Indians armed themselves with wood ; " did those Indians
</p>
<p>attack the rioters 1
</p>
<p>A. They did. If they had not been shot, they would liave killed the
</p>
<p>men who entered, for they were the strongest.
</p>
<p>Q. Could the murder have been prevented by you ?
</p>
<p>iy .4. No : I nor no person here could have prevented it
</p>
<p>Q. "What number were the rioters ?
</p>
<p>A. I should say fifty.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you know any of them ?
</p>
<p>J. No ; they were strangers.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you now know who was in command 1
</p>
<p>A. I have been told, Lazarus Stewart of Donegal.
</p>
<p>Q. If the Indians had not attempted resistance, would the men have
</p>
<p>fled? (fired?)
</p>
<p>A. I couldn't tell ; I do not know.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think or believe that the rioters came with the intent to
</p>
<p>murder ?
</p>
<p>_ A. 1 heard them say, when they broke in, they wanted a strange Indian.
</p>
<p>y' Q. Was their object to murder him ?
</p>
<p>A. From what I have heard since, I think they meant to carry him off,
</p>
<p>that is my belief.
</p>
<p>Q. What was their purpose ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know.
</p>
<p>Q. Were the Indians killed all friends of this province 1
</p>
<p>A. I have been told they were not. I cannot tell of myself; I do not
</p>
<p>know.

</p>
<p>Honoured Sir :
</p>
<p>I furnish you with a full detail of all the particulars that could be gath-
</p>
<p>ered of the unhappy transactions of the fourteenth and twenty-seventh ol
</p>
<p>December last, as painful for you to read as me to write. The Deposi-
</p>
<p>tions can only state the fact that the Indians were killed. Be assured the
</p>
<p>Borough Authorities, when they placed the Indians in the Workhouse,
</p>
<p>thought it a place of security. I am sorry the Indians were not removed
</p>
<p>to Philadelphia, as recommended by us. It is too late to remedy. It is
</p>
<p>much to be regretted that there are evil-minded persons among us, who
</p>
<p>are trying to corrupt the mind? of the people by idle tales and horrible
</p>
<p>APPENDIX E. e5 1 5
</p>
<p>butcheries  are injuring the character of many of our most respectable
</p>
<p>people. That printers should have lent their aid astonishes me when they
</p>
<p>are employed by the Assembly to print their laws. I can see no good in
</p>
<p>meeting their falsehoods by counter statements.
</p>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Elder and Mr. Harris are determined to rely upon the
</p>
<p>reputation they have so well established.
</p>
<p>For myself, I can only say that, possessing your confidence, and thai
</p>
<p>of the Proprietaries, with a quiet conscience, I regard not the mahgnanl
</p>
<p>pens of secret assailants  men who had not the courage to affix their
</p>
<p>names. Is it not strange that a too ready belief was at first given to the
</p>
<p>slanderous epistles 1 Resting on the favor I have enjoyed of the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment ; on the confidence reposed in me, by you and the Proprietaries ;
</p>
<p>by the esteem of my fellow-men in Lancaster, I silently remain passive.

</p>
<p>cember 27, 1763.
</p>
<p>The storm which had been so long gathering, has at length exploded.
</p>
<p>Had Government removed the Indians from Conestoga, which had fre-
</p>
<p>quently been urged, without success, this painful catastrophe might have
</p>
<p>been avoided. What could I do with men heated to madness 1 All that
</p>
<p>I could do, was done; I expostulated ; but life and reason were set at
</p>
<p>defiance. And yet the men, in private life, are virtuous and respectable ;
</p>
<p>not cruel, but mild and merciful.
</p>
<p>The time will arrive when each palliating circumstance will be calmlj^
</p>
<p>weighed. This deed, magnified into the blackest of crimes, shall be con-
</p>
<p>sidered one of those youthful ebullitions of wrath caused by momentary
</p>
<p>excitement, to which human infirmity is subjected.

<p>The following letter from Rev. John Elder to Colonel Shipptm will
</p>
<p>serve to exhibit the state of feeling among the frontier inhabitants.
</p>
<p>Paxton, Feb. 1, 1764.
</p>
<p>Dear Sir :
</p>
<p>Since I sealed the Governor's Letter, which you'll please to deliver to
</p>
<p>him, I suspect, from the frequent meetings I hear the people have had in
</p>
<p>divers parts of the Frontier Counties, that an Expedition is immediately
</p>
<p>designed against the Indians at Philadelphia. It's well known that I
</p>
<p>have always used my utmost endeavors to discourage these proceedings ;
</p>
<p>but to little purpose : the minds of the Inhabitants are so exasperated
</p>
<p>against a particular set of men, deeply con'terned in the government, for
</p>
<p>the singular regards they have always shown to savages, and the heavy
</p>
<p>burden by their means laid on the province in maintaining an expensive
</p>
<p>Trade and holding Treaties from time to time with the savages, without
</p>
<p>any prospect of advantage either to his Majesty or to the province, how
</p>
<p>benefit ial soever it may have been to individuals, that it's in vain, nay
</p>
<p>even unsafe for any one to oppose their measures ; for were Col. Shippen
</p>
<p>here, tho' a gentleman highly esteemed by the Frontier inhabitants, he
</p>
<p>would soon find it useless, if not dangerous, to act in opposition to an

<p>enraged multitude. At first there were but, as I think, few concerned in
</p>
<p>tliese riots, & nothing intended by some but to ease the province of part
</p>
<p>of its burden, and by others, who had suffered greatly in the late war
</p>
<p>the gratifying a spirit of Revenge, yet the manner of the Quakers
</p>
<p>resenting these things has been, I think, very injurious and impoUtick.
</p>
<p>The Presbytenans, who are the most numerous, I imagine, of any denom-
</p>
<p>ination in the province, are enraged at their being charged in bulk with
</p>
<p>these facts, under the name of Scotch-Irish, and other ill-natured titles,
</p>
<p>and that the kilhng the Conestogoe Indians is compared to the Irish
</p>
<p>Massacres, and reckoned the most barbarous of either, so that things are
</p>
<p>grown to that pitch now that the country seems determined that no Indian
</p>
<p>Treaties shall be held, or savages maintained at the expense of th
</p>
<p>348 APPENDIX E.
</p>
<p>province, unless his Majesty's pleasure on these heads is well known ,
</p>
<p>for I understood to my great satisfaction that amid our great confusions,
</p>
<p>there are none, even of the most warm and furious tempers, but "vhat
</p>
<p>are warmly attached to his Majesty, and would cheerfully risk their lives
</p>
<p>to promote his service. What the numbers are of those going on the
</p>
<p>above-mentioned Expedition, I can't possibly learn, as I'm informed they
</p>
<p>are collecting in all parts of the province ; however, this much may be
</p>
<p>depended on, that they have the good wishes of the country in general,
</p>
<p>and that there are few but what are now either one way or other em-
</p>
<p>barked in the affair, tho' some particular persons, I'm informed, are
</p>
<p>grossly misrepresented in Philadelphia ; even my neighbor, Mr. Harris,
</p>
<p>it's said, is looked on there as the chief promoter of these riots, yet it's
</p>
<p>entirely false ; he had aided as much in opposition to these measures as
</p>
<p>he could with any safety in his situation. Reports, however groundless,
</p>
<p>are spread by designing men on purpose to inflame matters, and enrage
</p>
<p>the parties against each other, and various methods used to accomplish
</p>
<p>their pernicious ends. As I am deeply concerned for the welfare of my
</p>
<p>country, I would do every thing in my power to promote its interests
</p>
<p>I thought proper to give you these few hints , you'll please to make
</p>
<p>what use you think proper of them. 1 would heartily wish that some
</p>
<p>effectual measures might be taken to heal these growing evils, and thia
</p>
<p>I judge may be yet done, and Col. Armstrong, who is now in town, may
</p>
<p>be usefully employed for this purpose.

<p>iSxtracts from a Quaker letter on the Paxton riots.
</p>
<p>This letter is written with so much fidelity, and in so impartial a
</p>
<p>bpirit, that it must always remain one of the best authorities in reference
</p>
<p>to these singular events. Although in general very accurate, its testimony
</p>
<p>has in a few instances been set aside in favor of the more direct evidence
</p>
<p>of eye-witnesses. It was pubHshed by Hazard in the twelfth volume

<p>given fbrm but a small part of the entire letter.
</p>
<p>Before I proceed further it may not be amiss to inform thee that a great
</p>
<p>number of the inhabitants here approved of killing the Indians, and
</p>
<p>declared that tliey would not offer to oppose the Paxtoneers, unless they
</p>
<p>attacked the citizens, that is to say, themselves  for, if any judgment
</p>
<p>was to be formed from countenances and behavior, tho.se who depended
</p>
<p>upon them for defence and protection, would have found their confidence
</p>
<p>shockingly misplaced.
</p>
<p>The number of persons in arms that morning was about olx hundred,
</p>
<p>and as it was expected the insurgents would attempt to cross at the middle
</p>
<p>or upper ferry, orders wv^re sent to bring the boats to this sideband to take
</p>
<p>APPENDIX E. 349
</p>
<p>away the ropes. Couriers were now seen continually coming in, tlieii
</p>
<p>horses all of a foam, and people running with the greatest eagerness to asi
</p>
<p>them where the enemy were, and what were their numbers. The answer.*
</p>
<p>to these questions were various : sometimes they were at a distance, then
</p>
<p>near at hand  sometimes they were a thousand strong, tlien five hundred,
</p>
<p>then fifteen hundred ; in sliort, all was doubt and uncertainty.
</p>
<p>About eleven o'clock it was recollected tlie boat at the Sweed's ford waa
</p>
<p>not secured, which, in the present case, was of the utmost consequence,
</p>
<p>for, as there was a considerable freshet in the Schuylkill, the securing that
</p>
<p>boat would oblige them to march some distance up the river, and thereby
</p>
<p>retard the execution of their scheme at least a day or two longer. Sev
</p>
<p>eral persons therefore set off immediately to get it performed ; but they
</p>
<p>had not been gone long, before there was a general uproar  They are
</p>
<p>coming ! they are coming ! Where ? where ? Down Second street !
</p>
<p>down Second street ! Such of the company as had grounded their fire-
</p>
<p>locks, flew to arms, and began to prime ; the artillery-men threw them-
</p>
<p>selves into order, and the people ran to get out of the way, for a troop of
</p>
<p>armed men, on horseback, appeared in reality coming down the istreet
</p>
<p>and one of the artillery-men was just going to apply the fatal match, when
</p>
<p>a person, perceiving the mistake, clapped his hat upon the touch-hole of
</p>
<p>the piece he was going to fire. Dreadful would have been the conse-
</p>
<p>quence, had the cannon discharged; for the men that appeared proved
</p>
<p>to be a company of German butchers and porters, under the command
</p>
<p>of Captain Hoffman. They had just collected themselves, and being
</p>
<p>unsuspicious of danger, had neglected to give notice of their coming ;
</p>
<p> a false alarm was now called out, and all became quiet again in a few
</p>
<p>minutes. . . .
</p>
<p>The weather being now very wet, Capt. Francis, Capt. Wood, and Capt.
</p>
<p>Mifflin, drew up their men under the market-house, which, not affording
</p>
<p>shelter for any more, they occupied Friends' meeting-house, and Capt.

<p>ing room, as I have been told  the rest were stationed below. It hap-

<p>was one of those who had been marked out as victims by these devout
</p>
<p>conquerors, and word was sent to him from Lancaster to make his peace
</p>
<p>with Heaven, for tliat he had but about ten days to live.
</p>
<p>In the evening our Negotiators came in from Germantown. They had
</p>
<p>conferred with the Chiefs of this illustrious  , and have prevailed with
</p>
<p>them to suspend all hostility till such time as they should receive an
</p>
<p>answer to their petition or manifesto, which had been sent down the day
</p>
<p>before. . . .

</p>
<p>The weather now clearing, the City forces drew up near the Court
</p>
<p>House where a speech was made to them, informing them that matters
</p>
<p>had been misrepresented,  that the Paxtoneers were a set of very worthy
</p>
<p>men (or s^metlnng to that purpose) who labored under great distress, 
</p>
<p>rtiat Messrs Smith, &c., were come (by their own authority) as represen-
</p>
<p>tatives, from several counties, to lay their complaints before the Legisla-
</p>
<p>ture, and that the reason for their arming themselves was for fear of being
</p>
<p>molested or abused. By whom? Why, by the peaceable citizens" -of
</p>
<p>Fhiladelphia ! Ha! ha! ha! Who can help laugliing ? The harangue
</p>
<p>tfoncruded with thanks for the trouble and expense they had been at
</p>
<p>(about notfiiug), and each retired to their several homes. The next day,
</p>
<p>ivhen all was quiet, and nobody dreamed of any further disturbance, we
</p>
<p>were alarmed again. The report now was, that the Paxtoneers had broke
</p>
<p>ihe Treaty, and were just entering the city. It is incredible to think with
</p>
<p>what alacrity the people flew to arms ; in one quarter of an hour near a
</p>
<p>thousand ot them were assembled, with a determination to bring the aflair
</p>
<p>to a conclusion immediately, and not to suffer themselves to be harassed
</p>
<p>as they had been several days past. If the whole body of the enemy had
</p>
<p>come in, as was expected, the engagement would have been a bloody one,
</p>
<p>fbr the citizens were exasperated almost to madness ; but happily those
</p>
<p>that appeared did not exceed thirty, (the rest having gone homewards),
</p>
<p>and as they behaved with decency, they were suffered to pass without
</p>
<p>opposition. Thus the storm blew over, and the Inhabitants dispersed
</p>
<p>themselves. ...
</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Gazette, usually a faithful chronicler of the events
</p>
<p>of the day, preserves a discreet silence on the subject of the Paxton riots
</p>
<p>and contains no other notice of them than the following condensed
</p>
<p>statement : 
</p>
<p>On Saturday last, the City was alarmed with the News of Great Num
</p>
<p>bers of armed Men, from the Frontiers, being on the several Roads, and
</p>
<p>moving towarils Philadelphia. As their designs were unknown, and there
</p>
<p>were various T^eports concerning them, it was thought prudent to put the
</p>
<p>City in some Posture of Defence against any Outrages that might possibly
</p>
<p>be intended. The Inhabitants being accordingly called upon by the Gov

<p>ernor, great numbers of tliem entered into an Association, and took Arma
</p>
<p>for the Support of Government, and Maintenance of good Order.
</p>
<p>Six Companies of Foot, one of Artillery, and two Troops of Horse,
</p>
<p>were formed, and paraded, to which, it is said, some Thousands, who did
</p>
<p>not appear, were prepared to join themselves, in case any attempt should
</p>
<p>be made against tlie Town. The Barracks also, where the Indians are
</p>
<p>lodged, under Protection of the regular Troops, were put into a good
</p>
<p>Posture of Defence ; several Works being thrown up about them, and
</p>
<p>eight Pieces of Cannon planted there.
</p>
<p>The Insurgents, it seems, intended to rendezvous at Germantown ; but
</p>
<p>the Precautions taken at tlie several Ferries over Schuylkill impeded
</p>
<p>their Junction ; and tliose who assembled there, being made acquainted

<p>to Attack the Town. Immediately, on Beat of Dram, a much greater

</p>
<p>As to public affairs, our Province is greatly involved in intestine feuds,
</p>
<p>at a time, when we should rather unite, one and all, to manage the affairs
</p>
<p>of our several Governments, with prudence and discretion. A few
</p>
<p>designing men, having engrossed too much power into their hands, are
</p>
<p>pushing matters beyond all bounds. There are twenty-two Quakers in
</p>
<p>our Assembly, at present, who, although they won't absolutely refuse to
</p>
<p>grant money for the King's use, yet never fail to contrive matters in such
</p>
<p>a manner as to afford little or no assistance to the poor, distressed Fron-
</p>
<p>tiers ; while our public money is lavishly squandered away in supporting
</p>
<p>a number of savages, who have been murdering and scalping us for many
</p>
<p>years past. This has so enraged some desperate young men, who had
</p>
<p>lost their nearest relations, by these very Indians, to cut off about twenty
</p>
<p>Indians that lived near Lancaster, who had, during the war, carried on a con-
</p>
<p>stant intercourse with our other enemies ; and they came down to German-
</p>
<p>town to inquire why Indians, known to be enemies, were supported, even

<p>in luxury, with the best that our markets afforded, at the public expense,
</p>
<p>while they were left in the utmost distress on the Frontiers, in want of
</p>
<p>the necessaries of life. Ample promises were made to them that their
</p>
<p>grievances should be redressed, upon which they immediately dispersed
</p>
<p>and went home. These persons have been unjustly represented as endeav
</p>
<p>oring to overturn Government, when nothing was more distant from their
</p>
<p>minds. However this matter may be looked upon in Britain, where you
</p>
<p>know very little of the matter, you may be assured that ninety -nine in an
</p>
<p>hundred of the Province are firmly persuaded, that they are maintaining
</p>
<p>our enemies, while our friends back are suffering the greatest extremities,
</p>
<p>neglected ; and that few, but Quakers, think that the Lancaster Indiana
</p>
<p>have suffered any thing but their just deserts. 'Tis not a little surprising

</p>
<p>to us here, that orders should he sent from the Crown, to apprehend and
</p>
<p>bring to justice those persons wlio liave cut off that nest of enemies that
</p>
<p>lived near Lancaster. Tliey never were subjects to his Majesty; were a
</p>
<p>free, independent state, retaining all tlie powers of a free state ; sat in all
</p>
<p>our Treaties with the Indians, as one of the tribes belonging to the Six
</p>
<p>Xations, in alliance with us; they entertained the French and Indian
</p>
<p>spies  gave intelligence to them of the defenceless state of our Province
</p>
<p> furnished them with Gazette every wet^k, or fortniglit  gave tliem
</p>
<p>intelligence of all the dispositions of the Province army against them 
</p>
<p>were frequently with the French and Indians at their forts and towns -
</p>
<p>supplied them with warlike stores  joined with the strange Indians in
</p>
<p>their war-dances, and in the parties that made incursions on our Frontiers
</p>
<p> were ready to take up the hatchet against the English openly, when
</p>
<p>the French requested it  actually murdered and scalped some of the
</p>
<p>Frontier inhabitants  insolently boasted of the murders they had com-
</p>
<p>mitted, when they saw our blood was cooled, after the last Treaty at Lan-"
</p>
<p>caster  confessed that they had been at war with us, and would soon be
</p>
<p>at war with us again (which accordingly happened), and even went so far
</p>
<p>as to put one of their own warriors, Jegarie, to death, because he refused
</p>
<p>to go to war with them against the English. All these things were known
</p>
<p>througli the Frontier inhabitants, and are since proved upon oath. This
</p>
<p>occasioned them to be cut off by about forty or fifty persons, collected
</p>
<p>from all the Frontier counties, though they are called by the name of the
</p>
<p>little Township of Paxton, where, possibly, the smallest part of them
</p>
<p>resided. And what surprises us more than all the accounts we have from
</p>
<p>England, is, that our Assembly, in a petition they have drawn up, to the
</p>
<p>King, for a change of Government, should represent this Province in a
</p>
<p>state of uproar and riot, and when not a man in it has once resisted a
</p>
<p>single officer of the Government, nor a single act of violence committed,
</p>
<p>unles you call the Lancaster affair such, although it was no more than
</p>
<p>going to war with that tribe, as they had done before with others, without
</p>
<p>a formal proclamation of war by the Government. I have not time, as
</p>
<p>you may guess by this scrawl, to write more at this time, but only that I
</p>
<p>am yours, &c.

</p>
<p>3. Memorials of the Paxton Men. (Chap. XXV.)
</p>
<p>5. To the Honorable John Penn, Esq., Governor of the Province of
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania, and of the Counties of New-Castle, Kent, and Sussex, upon
</p>
<p>Delaware ; and to the Pepresentatives of the Freemen of the said
</p>
<p>Province, in General Assembly met.
</p>
<p>We, Matthew Smith and James Gibson, in Behalf of ourselves and his
</p>
<p>Majesty's faithful and loyal Subjects, the Inhabitants of the Frontier
</p>
<p>Counties of Lancaster, York, Cumberland, Berks, and Northampton,
</p>
<p>humbly beg Leave to remonstrate and lay before you the following
</p>
<p>(irievances, which we submit to vour Wisdom for Redress
</p>
<p>APPENDIX E. 35s
</p>
<p>First. "We apprehend that, as Freemen and English Subjects, we
</p>
<p>have an indisputable Title to the same Privileges and Immunities with
</p>
<p>his Majesty's other Subjects, who reside in the interior Counties of Phila
</p>
<p>delphia, Chester, and Bucks and tlierefore ought not to be excluded from
</p>
<p>an equal Share with them in the very important Privilege of Legisla-
</p>
<p>tion ;  nevertheless, contrary to the Proprietor's Charter, and the
</p>
<p>%( knowledged Principles of common Justice and Equity, our live Coun-
</p>
<p>ties are restrained from electing more than ten Representatives, viz., four
</p>
<p>for Lancaster, two for York, two tor Cumberland, one for Berks, and one
</p>
<p>for Northampton, while the three Counties and City of Philadelphia,
</p>
<p>Chester, and Bucks elect Twenty-six. This we humbly conceive is
</p>
<p>oppressive, unequal and unjust, the Cause of many of our Grievances,
</p>
<p>and an Infringement of our natural Privileges of Freedom and Equality;
</p>
<p>wherefore we humbly pray that we may be no longer deprived of an
</p>
<p>equal Number with the three aforesaid Counties to represent us in
</p>
<p>\ssembly.
</p>
<p>Secondly. We understand that a Bill is now before the House of As-
</p>
<p>sembly, wherein it is provided, that such Persons as shall be charged with
</p>
<p>killing any Indians in Lancaster County, shall not be tried in the County
</p>
<p>where the Fact was committed, but in the Counties of Philadelphia,
</p>
<p>Chester, or Bucks. This is manifestly to deprive British Subjects of
</p>
<p>their known Privileges, to cast an eternal Reproach upon whole Counties,
</p>
<p>as if they were unfit to serve their Country in the Quality of Jury-men,
</p>
<p>and to contradict the well known Laws of the British Nation, in a Point
</p>
<p>whereon Life, Liberty, and Security essentially depend ; namely, that of
</p>
<p>being tried by their Equals, in the Neighbourhood where their own, their
</p>
<p>Accusers, and the Witnesses Character and Credit, with the Circum-
</p>
<p>stances of the Fact, are best known, and instead thereof putting their
</p>
<p>Lives in tlie Hands of Strangers, who may as justly be suspected of
</p>
<p>Partiahty to, as the Frontier Counties can be of Prejudices against, In-
</p>
<p>Jians ; and this too, in favour of Indians only, against his Majesty's
</p>
<p>faithful and loyal Subjects : Besides, it is well known, that the Design of
</p>
<p>it is to comprehend a Fact committed before such a Law was thought of.
</p>
<p>And if such Practices were tolerated, no Man could be secure in his most

</p>
<p>invaluable Interest.  We are also informed, to our great Surprise, that
</p>
<p>this Bill has actually received the Assent of a Majority of the House ;
</p>
<p>which we are persuaded could not have been the Case, had our Frontier
</p>
<p>Counties been equally represented in Assembly.  However, we hope
</p>
<p>that the Legislature of this Province will never enact a Law of so danger
</p>
<p>ovw a Tendency, or take away from his Majesty's good Subjects a Privi
</p>
<p>lege so long esteemed sacred by Englishmen.
</p>
<p>Thirdly. During the late and present Indian War, the Frontiers of this
</p>
<p>Province have been repeatedly attacked and ravaged by skulking Parties
</p>
<p>i>v" the Indians, who have, with the most Savage Cruelty, murdered Men,
</p>
<p>Women, and Children, without Distinction, and have reduced near a Thou-
</p>
<p>sa.id Families to the most extreme Distress.  It grieves us to the very Heart
</p>
<p>to see such of our Frontier Inhabitants as have escaped Savage Fury,
</p>
<p>VOL. II. 23
</p>
<p>354 APPENDIX E.
</p>
<p>witli the Loss of their Parents, their Children, their Wives or Relatives,
</p>
<p>left Destitute by the PubUc, and exposed to the most cruel Poverty and
</p>
<p>Wretchedness, while upwards of an Hundred and Twenty of these
</p>
<p>Savages, who are, with great Reason, suspected of being guilty of these
</p>
<p>horrid Barbarities, under the Mask of Friendship, have procured them-
</p>
<p>selves to be taken under the Protection of the Government, with a View
</p>
<p>to elude the Fury of the brave Relatives of the Murdered, and are now
</p>
<p>maintained at the public Expense.  Some of these Indians, now in the
</p>
<p>Barracks of Philadelphia, are confessedly a Part of the Wyalusing In
</p>
<p>iians, which Tribe is now at War with us ; and the others are the Mora-
</p>
<p>vian Indians, who, living with us, under the Cloak of Friendship, carried
</p>
<p>on a Correspondence with our known Enemies on the Great Island. 
</p>
<p>We cannot but observe, with Sorrow and Indignation, that some Persons
</p>
<p>in this Province are at Pains to extenuate the barbarous Cruelties prac-
</p>
<p>tised by these Savages on our murdered Brethren and Relatives, which
</p>
<p>are shocking to human Nature, and must pierce every Heart, but that of
</p>
<p>the hardened Perpetrators or their Abettors. Nor is it less distressing to
</p>
<p>hear Others pleading, that although the Wyalusing Tribe is at War with
</p>
<p>us, yet that Part of it which is under the Protection of the Government, may
</p>
<p>be friendly to the English, and innocent:  In what Nation under the
</p>
<p>Sun was it ever the Custom, that when a neighbouring Nation took up
</p>
<p>Arms, not an Individual should be touched, but only the Persons that
</p>
<p>offered Hostilities ?  Who ever proclaimed War with a Part of a Nation
</p>
<p>and not with the whole 1  Had these Indians disapproved of the Perfidy
</p>
<p>of their Tribe, and been willing to cultivate and preserve Friendship w^ith
</p>
<p>us, why did they not give Notice of the War before it happened, as it
</p>
<p>is known to be the Result of long Deliberations, and a preconcerted
</p>
<p>Combination among them 1  AVhy did they not leave their Tribe imme-
</p>
<p>diately, and come among us, before there was Ground to suspect them,
</p>
<p>Dr War was actually waged with their Tribe 1  No, they stayed amongst
</p>
<p>them, were privy to their Murders and Ravages, until we had destroyed
</p>
<p>their Provisions, and when they could no longer subsist at Home, they
</p>
<p>come not as Deserters, but as Friends, to be maintained through the
</p>
<p>Winter, that they may be able to scalp and butcher us in the Spring.

</p>
<p>And as to the Moravian Indians, there are strong Grounds at least to
</p>
<p>suspect their Friendship, as it is known that they carried on a Correspond-
</p>
<p>ence with our Enemies on the Great Island.  We killed three Indians
</p>
<p>going from Bethlehem to the Great Island with Blankets, Ammunition,
</p>
<p>and Provisions, which is an undeniable Proof that the Moravian Indiana
</p>
<p>were in Confederacy with our open Enemies. And we cannot but be
</p>
<p>filled with Indignation to hear this Action of ours painted in the most
</p>
<p>odious and detestable Colours, as if we had inhumanly murdered our
</p>
<p>Guides, who preserved us from perishing in the Woods ; when we only
</p>
<p>killed three of our known Enemies, who attempted to shoot us when we
</p>
<p>surprised them.  And, besides all this, we understand that one of these
</p>
<p>very Indians is proved, by the Oath of Stinton's Widow, to be the very
</p>
<p>Person that murdered her Husband.  How then comes it to pass, thai
</p>
<p>Ali5NDIX E. 355
</p>
<p>he alone, of all the Moravian Indians, should join the Enemy to murder
</p>
<p>that family "?  Or can it be supposed that any Enemy Indians, contrary
</p>
<p>to their known Custom of making War, should penetrate into the Heart
</p>
<p>of a settled Country, to burn, plunder, and murder the Inhabitants, and
</p>
<p>not molest any Houses in their Return, or ever be seen or h*^ard of? 
</p>
<p>Or how can we account for it, that no Ravages have been committed in
</p>
<p>Northampton County since the Removal of tlie Moravian Indians, when
</p>
<p>the Great Cove has been struck since 1  These Things put it beyond
</p>
<p>Doubt with us that the Indians now at Philadelphia are his Majesty's
</p>
<p>perfidious Enemies, and therefore, to protect and maintain them at the
</p>
<p>public Expence, while our suffering Brethren on the Frontiers are almost
</p>
<p>df.'stitute of the Necessaries of Life, and are neglected by the Public, is
</p>
<p>sufficient to make us mad with Rage, and tempt us to do what nothing
</p>
<p>but the most violent Necessity can vindicate.  We humbly and earnestly
</p>
<p>pray therefore, that those Enemies of his Majesty may be removed as
</p>
<p>soon as possible out of the Province.
</p>
<p>Fourthly. We humbly conceive that it is contrary to the Maxims of
</p>
<p>good Policy and extremely dangerous to our Prontiers, to suffer any
</p>
<p>Indians, of what Tribe soever, to live within the inhabited Parts of this
</p>
<p>Province, while we are engaged in an Indian War, as Experience has
</p>
<p>taught us that they are all perfidious, and their Claim to Ereedom and
</p>
<p>Independency, puts it in their Power to act as Spies, to entertain and
</p>
<p>give Intelligence to our Enemies, and to furnish them with Provisions
</p>
<p>and warlike Stores.  To this fatal Intercourse between our pretended
</p>
<p>Friends and open Enemies, we must ascribe the greatest Part of the
</p>
<p>Ravages and Murders that have been committed in the Course of this
</p>
<p>and the last Indian War.  We therefore pray that this Grievance be
</p>
<p>taken under Consideration, and remedied.
</p>
<p>Fifthly. We cannot help lamenting that no Provision has been hitherto
</p>
<p>made, that such of our Frontier Inhabitants as have been wounded in
</p>
<p>Defence of the Province, their Lives and Liberties may be taken Care of,
</p>
<p>and cured of their Wounds, at the public Expence. We therefore pray
</p>
<p>that this Grievance may be redressed.
</p>
<p>Sixthly. In the late Indian War this Province, with others of his
</p>

</p>
<p>Majjesty's Colonies, gave Rewards for Indian Scalps, to encourage the
</p>
<p>seeking them in their own Country, as the most likely Means of destroy-
</p>
<p>ing or reducing them to Reason ; but no such Encouragement has been
</p>
<p>given in this War, which has damped the Spirits of many brave Men, who
</p>
<p>are willing to venture their Lives in Parties against the Enemy.  We
</p>
<p>therefore pray that public Rewards may be proposed for Indian Scalps,
</p>
<p>which may be adequate to the Dangers attending Enterprises of this
</p>
<p>Nature.
</p>
<p>Seventhly. We daily lament that Numbers of our nearest and dearest
</p>
<p>Relatives are still in Captivity among the savage Heathen, to be trained
</p>
<p>up in all their Ignorance and Barbarity, or to be tortured to Death with all
</p>
<p>the Contrivances of Indian Cruelty, for attempting to make their Escape
</p>
<p>from Bondage. We see they pay no Regard to the many solemn Promises
</p>
<p>356 APPENDIX E.
</p>
<p>jfhicli they hare made to restore our Friends who are in Bondage amonget
</p>
<p>them.  We therefore earnestly pray that no Trade may hereafter be
</p>
<p>permitted to he carried on with them until our Brethren and Kelatiyes
</p>
<p>are brought Home to us.
</p>
<p>Eighthly. We complain that a certain Society of People in this
</p>
<p>Province in the late Indian War, and at several Treaties held by the
</p>
<p>King's Representatives, openly loaded the Indians with Presents; and
</p>
<p>that F. P., a Leader of the said Society, in Defiance of all Government,
</p>
<p>not only abetted our Indian Enemies, but kept up a private Intelligence
</p>
<p>with them, and pubhckly received from them a Belt of Wampum, as if
</p>
<p>he had been our Governor, or authorized by the King to treat with big
</p>
<p>Enemies.  By this means the Indians have been taught to despise us as
</p>
<p>a weak and disunited People, and from this Iktal Source have arose many
</p>
<p>of our Calamities under which we groan.  We humbly pray, therefore,
</p>
<p>that this Grievance may be redressed, and that no private Subject be
</p>
<p>hereafter permitted to treat with, or carry on a Correspondence with our
</p>
<p>Enemies.
</p>
<p>Ninthly. We cannot but observe with Sorrow, that Fort Augusta,
</p>
<p>which has been very expensive to this Province, has afforded us but little
</p>
<p>Assistance during this or the last War. The Men that were stationed at
</p>
<p>that Place neither helped our distressed Inhabitants to save their Crops,
</p>
<p>nor did they attack our Enemies in their Towns, or patrol on our
</p>
<p>Frontiers.  We humbly request that proper Measures may be taken to
</p>
<p>make that Garrison more serviceable to us in our Distress, if it can be
</p>
<p>done.
</p>
<p>N. B. We are far from intending any Reflection against the Com-
</p>
<p>manding Officer stationed at Augusta, as we presume his Conduct wai
</p>
<p>always directed by those from whom he received his Orders.

</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the Killing those Indians at Conestogoe Manor and Lan-
</p>
<p>caster has been, and may be, the Subject of much Conversation, and by
</p>
<p>invidious Representations of it, which some, we doubt not, will industri
</p>
<p>ously si)read, many, unacquainted with the true State of Affairs, may be
</p>
<p>led to pass a severe Censure on the Authors of those Facts, and any
</p>
<p>others of the like Nature which may hereafter happen, than we are per-
</p>
<p>suaded they would, if Matters were duly understood and deliberated;
</p>
<p>we think it therefore proper thus openly to declare ourselves, and render
</p>
<p>some brief Hints of the Reasons of our Conduct, which we must, and
</p>
<p>frankly do, confess nothing but Necessity itself could induce us to, or
</p>
<p>APPENDIX E. 35 T
</p>
<p>justify us in, as it bears an Appearance of flying in the Face of Author
</p>
<p>ity, and is attended with much Labour, Fatigue and Expence.
</p>
<p>Ourselves then, to a Man, we profess to be loyal Subjects to the best
</p>
<p>of Kings, our rightful Sovereign George tlie Third, firmly attached to his
</p>
<p>Royal Person, Interest and Government, and of Consequence equally
</p>
<p>opposite to the Enemies of his Throne and Dignity, whether openly
</p>
<p>avowed, or more dangerously concealed under a Mask of falsely pretended
</p>
<p>Friendship, and chearfully wilhng to offer our Substance and Lives in
</p>
<p>his Cause.
</p>
<p>These Indians, known to be firmly connected in Friendship with our
</p>
<p>openly avowed embittered Enemies, and some of whom have, by several
</p>
<p>Oaths, been proved to be Murderers, and who, by their better Acquaintr
</p>
<p>ance with the Situation and State of our Frontier, were more capable of
</p>
<p>doing us Mischief, we saw, with Indignation, cherished and caressed aa
</p>
<p>dearest Friends ;  But this, alas ! is but a Part, a small Part, of that
</p>
<p>excessive Regard manifested to Indians, beyond his Majesty's loyal
</p>
<p>Subjects, whereof we com])lain, and which, together with various other
</p>
<p>Grievances, have not only inflamed with Resentment the Breasts of a
</p>
<p>Number, and urged them to the disagreeable Evidence of it, they have
</p>
<p>been constrained to give, but have heavily displeased, by far, the greatest
</p>
<p>Part of the good Inhabitants of this Province.
</p>
<p>Should we here reflect to former Treaties, the exorbitant Presents,
</p>
<p>and great Servility therein paid to Indians, have long been oppressive
</p>
<p>Grievances we have groaned under ; and when at the last Lidian Treaty
</p>
<p>held at Lancaster, not only was the Blood of our many murdered Breth-
</p>
<p>ren tamely covered, but our poor unhappy captivated Friends abandoned
</p>
<p>to Slavery among the Savages, by concluding a Friendship with the
</p>
<p>Indians, and allowing them a plenteous trade of all kinds of Commodities,
</p>
<p>without those being restored, or any properly spirited Requisition made of
</p>
<p>them :  How general Dissatisfaction those Measures gave, the Murmurs
</p>
<p>of all good people (loud as they dare to utter them) to this Day declare.
</p>
<p>And had here infatuated Steps of Conduct, and a manifest Partiality in
</p>
<p>Favour of Indians, made a final Pause, happy had it been :  We per-
</p>
<p>haps had grieved in Silence for our abandoned enslaved Brethren among

<p>tho Heathen, but Matters of a later Date are still more flagrant Reasons
</p>
<p>of Complaint.  When last Summer his Majesty's Forces, under the
</p>
<p>Command of Colonel Bouquet, marched through this Province, and a
</p>
<p>Demand was made by his Excellency, General Amherst, of Assistance,
</p>
<p>to escort Provisions, &c., to relieve that important Post, Fort Pitt, yet not
</p>
<p>one Man was granted, although never any Thing appeared more reason
</p>
<p>able or necessary, as the Interest of the Province lay so much at StaJte,
</p>
<p>and the Standing of the Frontier Settlements, in any Manner, evidently
</p>
<p>depended, under God, on the almost despaired of Success of his Majesty's
</p>
<p>little Army, whose Valour the whole Frontiers with Gratitude acknowl-
</p>
<p>edge, as the happy Means of having saved from Ruin great Part of the
</p>
<p>Province :  But when a Number of Indians, falsely pretended Frieiids
</p>
<p>wid having among them some proved on Oath to have been guilty of
</p>
<p>358 APPENDIX B.
</p>
<p>Murder since this War begun ; when they, together with others, known
</p>
<p>to be his Majesty's Enemies, and who had been in the Battle against
</p>
<p>Colonel Bouquet, reduced to Distress by the Destruction of their Corn at
</p>
<p>the Great Island, and up the East Branch of Susquehanna, pretend them-
</p>
<p>selves Eriends, and desire a Subsistence, they are openly caressed, and
</p>
<p>the Public, that could not be indulged the Liberty of contributing to liis
</p>
<p>Majesty's Assistance, obliged, as Tributaries to Savages, to Support
</p>
<p>these Villains, these Enemies to our King and our Country ; nor only so,
</p>
<p>but the Hands that were closely shut, nor would grant liis Majesty's
</p>
<p>General a single Fartliing against a savage Foe, have been Uberally
</p>
<p>opened, and tlie public Money basely prostituted, to hire, at an exorbi-
</p>
<p>tant Kate, a mercenary Guard to protect his Majesty's worst of Enemies,
</p>
<p>those falsely pretended Indian Eriends, while, at the same Time, Hundreds
</p>
<p>of poor, distressed Famihes of his Majesty's Subjects, obliged to abandon
</p>
<p>their Possessions, and fly for their Lives at least, are left, except a small
</p>
<p>Relief at first, in the most distressing Circumstances to starve neglected,
</p>
<p>save what the friendly Hand of private Donations has contributed to
</p>
<p>their Support, wherein they who are most profuse towards Savages have
</p>
<p>careMly avoided having any Part.  When last Summer the Troops
</p>
<p>raised for Defence of the Province were limited to certain Bounds, nor
</p>
<p>Buffered to attempt annoying our Enemies in their Habitations, and a
</p>
<p>Number of brave Volunteers, equipped at their own Expence, marched
</p>
<p>in September up the Susquehanna, met and defeated their Enemy, with
</p>
<p>the Loss of some of their Number, and having others dangerously
</p>
<p>wounded, not the least Thanks or Acknowledgment was made them from
</p>
<p>the Legislature for the confessed Service they had done, nor any the least
</p>
<p>Notice or Care taken of their Wounded ; whereas, when a Seneca Inchan,
</p>
<p>who, by the Information of many, as well as by his own Confession, had
</p>
<p>been, through the last War, our inveterate Enemy, had got a Cut in his
</p>
<p>Head last Summer in a Quarrel he had with Ms own Cousin, and it was
</p>
<p>reported in Philadelphia that his Wound was dangerous, a Doctor was
</p>
<p>immediately employed, and sent to Fort Augusta to take Care of him,
</p>
<p>and cure him, if possible.  To these may be added, that though it was
</p>
<p>impossible to obtam through the Summer, or even yet, any Premium for

<p>Indian Scalps, or Encouragement to excite Volunteers to go forth against
</p>
<p>them, yet when a few of them, known to be the Fast Friends of our
</p>
<p>Enemies, and some of them Murderers themselves, when these have been
</p>
<p>Btruck by a distressed, bereft, injured Frontier, a Hberal Reward is offered
</p>
<p>for apprehending the Perpetrators of that horrible Crime of kilUng his

<p>Majesty's cloaked Enemies, and their Conduct pamted in the most atro-
</p>
<p>cious Colors ; while the horrid Ravages, cruel Murders, and most shock-
</p>
<p>ing Barbarities, committed by Indians on his Majesty's Subjects, are
</p>
<p>covered over, and excused, under the charitable Term of this being their
</p>
<p>Method of making War.
</p>
<p>But to recount the many repeated Grievances whereof we might justly

<p>complain, and Instances of a most violent Attachment to Indians, were tedi-

<p>ous beyond the Patience of a Job to endure ; nor can better be expected

</p>
<p>uor need we be surprised at Indians Insolence and Villainy, when it is
</p>
<p>considered, and which can be proved from the public Records of a certain
</p>
<p>Countj, that some Time before Conrad Weiser died, some Indians belong-
</p>
<p>ing to the Great Island or Wyalousing, assured him that Israel Pember-
</p>
<p>ton, (an ancient Leader of that Faction which, for so long a Time, have
</p>
<p>found Means to enslave thi Prorj^ee to Indians,) together with others of
</p>
<p>the Friends, had given them a Roi to scourge the white People that were
</p>
<p>settled on the purchased Lands ; for that Oaas had cheated them out of
</p>
<p>ft great Deal of Land, or had not given near sufUcient Price for wliat ho
</p>
<p>had bought ; and that the Traders ought also to be scourged, for that
</p>
<p>they defrauded the Indians, by selling Goods to them at too dear a Rate ;
</p>
<p>and that this Relation is Matter of Fact, can easily be proved in the
</p>
<p>County of Berks.  Such is our unhappy Situation, under the Villainy,
</p>
<p>Infatuation and Influence of a certain Faction, that have got the political
</p>
<p>Reins in their Hands, and tamely tyrannize over the other good Subjects
</p>
<p>of the Province !  And can it be thought strange, that a Scene of such
</p>
<p>Treatment as this, and the now adding, in this critical Juncture, to all
</p>
<p>our former Distresses, that disagreeable Burden of supporting, in the very
</p>
<p>Heart of the Province, at so great an Expence, between One and Two
</p>
<p>hundred Indians, to the great Disquietude of the Majority of the good
</p>
<p>Inhabitants of this Province, should awaken the Resentment of a People
</p>
<p>grossly abused, unrighteously burdened, and made Dupes and Slaves to
</p>
<p>Indians ?  And must not all well-disposed People entertain a charitable
</p>
<p>Sentiment of those who, at their own great Expence and Trouble, havo

<p>attempted, or shall attempt, rescuing a laboring Land tVom a Weight so

<p>oppressive, unreasonable, and unjust 1  It is this we design, it is this

<p>CAMPAIGN OF 1764.
</p>
<p>1. Bouquet's Expedition.
</p>
<p>Jitter General Gage to Lord Halifax, December 13. 1764. (Chap
</p>
<p>ITXVII.)
</p>
<p>The Perfidy of the Shawanese and Delawares, and their having
</p>
<p>broken the ties, which even the Savage Nations hold sacred amongst each
</p>
<p>other, required vigorous measures to reduce them. We had experienced
</p>
<p>their treachery so often, that I determined to make no jjeace with tliem,
</p>
<p>but in the Heart of their Country, and upon such terms as should make
</p>
<p>it as secure as it was possible. This conduct has produced all the good
</p>
<p>effects which could be wished or expected from it. Those Indians have
</p>
<p>been humbled and reduced to accept of Peace upon the terms prescribed
</p>
<p>to them, in such a manner as will give reputation to His Majesty's Arms
</p>
<p>amongst the several Nations. The Regular and Provincial Troops under
</p>
<p>Colonel Bouquet, having been joined by a good body of Volunteers
</p>
<p>from Virginia, and others from Maryland and Pennsylvania, marched
</p>
<p>from Fort Pitt the Begmning of October, and got to Tuscaroras about
</p>
<p>the fifteenth. The March of the Troops into their Country threw the
</p>
<p>Savages into the greatest Consternation, as they had hoped their Woods
</p>
<p>would protect them, and had boasted of the Security of their Situation
</p>
<p>from our Attacks. The Indians hovered round the Troops during their
</p>
<p>March, but despairing of success in an Action, had recourse to Negotia
</p>
<p>tions. They were told that they might have Peace, but every Prisoner
</p>
<p>in their possession must first be delivered up. They brought in near
</p>
<p>twenty, and promised to deliver the Rest; but as their promises were
</p>
<p>not regarded, they engaged to dehver the whole on the 1st of November,
</p>
<p>at the Forks of the Muskingham, about one hundred and fifty miles from
</p>
<p>Fort Pitt, the Centre of the Delaware Towns, and near to the most con
</p>
<p>Biderable settlement of the Shawanese. Colonel Bouquet kept them in
</p>
<p>Bight, and moved his Camp to that Place. He soon obliged the Dela-

</p>
<p>}^awa and some broken tribes of Mohikons, Wiaudots, and Mingoes, to
</p>
<p>APPENDIX F. 361
</p>
<p>bring in all their Prisoners, even to the Children bom of White Women,
</p>
<p>and to tie those who were grown as Savage as themselves and unwUling
</p>
<p>to leave them, and bring them bound to the Camp. They were then
</p>
<p>told that they must appoint deputies to go to Sir WiUiam Johnson to
</p>
<p>receive such terms as should be imposed upon them, which the Nations
</p>
<p>should agree to ratify ; and, for the security of their performance of tliis,
</p>
<p>and that no farther Hostilities should be committed, a number of their
</p>
<p>Chiefs must remain in our hands. The above Nations subscribed to
</p>
<p>these terms ; but the Shawanese were more obstinate, and were particu-
</p>
<p>larly averse to the giving of Hostages. But finding their obstinacy had
</p>
<p>no effect, and would only tend to their destruction, tlie Troops harmg
</p>
<p>penetrated into the Heart of their Country, they at length became sensi-
</p>
<p>ble that there was no safety but in Submission, and were obUged to
</p>
<p>stoop to the same Conditions as the other nations. They immediately
</p>
<p>gave up forty Prisoners, and promised the Rest should be sent to Fort
</p>
<p>Pitt in the Spring. This last not being admitted, the immediate Eestitu
</p>
<p>tion of all the Prisoners being the sine qua non of peace, it was agreed,
</p>
<p>that parties should be sent from the Army into their towns, to collect the
</p>
<p>Prisoners, and conduct them to Fort Pitt. They delivered six of their
</p>
<p>principal Cliiefs as hostages into our Hands, and appointed their deputies
</p>
<p>to go to Sir WiUiam Johnson, in the same manner as the Rest. The
</p>
<p>Number of Prisoners already delivered exceeds two hundred, and it was
</p>
<p>expected that our Parties would bring in near one hundred more from
</p>
<p>the Shawanese Towns. These Conditions seem sufficient Proofs of the
</p>
<p>Sincerity and Humiliation of those Nations, and in justice to Colonel
</p>
<p>Bouquet, I must testify the Obligations I have to liim, and that nothing
</p>
<p>but the firm and steady conduct, wliich he observed in all liia Transac-
</p>
<p>tions with those treacherous savages, would ever have brought them to
</p>
<p>a serious Peace.
</p>
<p>I must flatter myself, that the Country is restored to its former Tran-
</p>
<p>quillity, and that a general, and, it is hoped, lasting Peace is concluded
</p>
<p>with all the Indian Nations who have taken up Arms against his Majesty.

<p>I remain,

</p>
<p>Extract from a letter of Sir William Johnson to the Board of Trade,
</p>
<p>1764, December 26: 
</p>
<p>Your Lordships will please to observe that for many months before the
</p>
<p>march of Colonel Bradstreet's army, several of the Western Nations had
</p>
<p>expressed a desire for peace, and had ceased to commit hostilities, that
</p>
<p>even Pontiac inclined that way, but did not choose to venture liis person
</p>
<p>by coming into any of the posts. This was the state of affairs when I
</p>
<p>treated with the Indians at Niagara, in which number were fifteen hun-
</p>
<p>dred of the Western Nations, a number infinitely more considerable than
</p>
<p>those who were twice treated with at Detroit, many of whom are the
</p>
<p>same people, particularly the Hurons and Cliippewas. In the mean time
</p>
<p>it now appears, from the very best authorities, and can be proved by the

<p>oath of several respectable persons, prisoners at the Illinois and amongst
</p>
<p>the Indians, as also from the accounts of the Indians themselves, that not
</p>
<p>only -many French traders, but also French officers came amongst the
</p>
<p>Indians, as they said, fully authorized to assure them that the French
</p>
<p>King was determined to support them to the utmost, and not only
</p>
<p>invited them to the Illinois, where they were plentifully supplied with
</p>
<p>ammunition and otlier necessaries, but also sent several canoes at differ-
</p>
<p>ent times up the Illinois river, to the Miamis, and otliers, as well as up the
</p>
<p>Ohio to the Shawanese and Delawares, as by Major Smallman's account^

</p>
<p>and sereral others, (then prisoners), transmitted me by Colonel Bouquet,
</p>
<p>and one of vaj officers who accompanied him, will appear. That in an
</p>
<p>especial manner the French promoted the interest of Pontiao, whose influ-
</p>
<p>ence is now become so considerable, as General Gage observes in a late
</p>
<p>letter to me, that it extends even to the Mouth of the Mississippi, and has
</p>
<p>been the principal occasion of our not as yet gaining the Illinois, wliich
</p>
<p>the French as well as Indians are interested in preventing. This Pontiac
</p>
<p>is not included in the late Treaty at Detroit, and is at the head of a great
</p>
<p>number of Indians privately supported by the French, an officer of whom
</p>
<p>was about three months ago at the Miamis Castle, at the Scioto Plains,
</p>
<p>Muskingum, and several other places. The Western Indians, who it
</p>
<p>seems ridicule tlie whole expedition, will be influenced to such a pitch,
</p>
<p>by the interested French on tlie one side, and the influence of Pontiac on
</p>
<p>the other, that we have great reason to apprehend a renewal of hostilities,
</p>
<p>or at least that they and the Twightees (Miamis) will strenuously oppose
</p>
<p>our possessing the Ilhnois, which can never be accomplished without their
</p>
<p>consent. And indeed it is not to be wondered that they should be con-
</p>
<p>cerned at our occupying that country, when we consider that the French
</p>
<p>(be their motive what it will) loaded them with favors, and continue to
</p>
<p>do so, accompanied with all outward marks of esteem, and an address
</p>
<p>pecuharly adapted to their manners, which infallibly gains upon aU
</p>
<p>Indians, who judge by extremes only, and with all their acquaintance
</p>
<p>with us upon the frontiers, have never found any thing like it, but on the
</p>
<p>contrary, harsh treatment, angry words, and in short any tiling which can
</p>
<p>be thought of to inspire them with a dislike to our manners and a jeal-
</p>
<p>ousy of our views. I have seen so much of these matters, and I am sc
</p>
<p>well convmced of the utter aversion that our people have for them in
</p>
<p>general, and of the imprudence with which they constantly express it,
</p>
<p>that I absolutely despair of our seeing tranquillity established, until youi
</p>
<p>Lordsliips* plan is fully settled, so as I may have proper persons to reside
</p>
<p>at the Posts, whose business it shall be to remove their prejudices, and
</p>
<p>whose interest it becomes to obtain their esteem and friendship.

<p>which our enemies have been and will always be supphed, is a matter I
</p>
<p>have very much at heart, and what I think may be eflTected this wmter
</p>
<p>by land by Mr. Croghan, in case matters can be so far settled with the
</p>
<p>Twightees, Shawanoes, and Pontiac, as to engage the latter, with some
</p>
<p>chiefs of the before-mentioned nations, to accompany him with a garrison.
</p>
<p>The expense attending this will be large, but the end to be obtained is
</p>
<p>too considerable to be neglected. I have accordingly recommended it to
</p>
<p>the consideration of General Gage, and shall, on the arrival of the Shaw-
</p>
<p>anoes, Delawares, &c., here, do all in my power to pave the way for
</p>
<p>efi*ecting it. I shall also make such a peace with them, as will be most
</p>
<p>for the credit and advantage of the crown, and the security of the trade
</p>
<p>and frontiers, and tie them down to such conditions as Indians will mof t
</p>
<p>probablv observe
