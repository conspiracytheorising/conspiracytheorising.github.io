</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>Under James I, the English Protestants were of three classes, the Con-
</p>
<p>formists, or High Ritualists ; the Nonconformists, or Puritans ; the Separatists,
</p>
<p>generally called " Brownists." The Conformists adopted all the rites and pag-
</p>
<p>eantry then retained by the Church of England, and asked for more rather
</p>
<p>than less. The Puritans, while refusing conformity to some of these ceremonies
</p>
<p>which they thought superstitious, adhered firmly to the same body, claiming it
</p>
<p>as the only true church, and defending its creed, polity, and discipline with
</p>
<p>a zeal quite equal to that of the dominant Conformists. The thorough-going
</p>
<p>Separatists denied that the state church was a Christian body, or that its
</p>
<p>ministrations and ordinances were of any validity. They claimed their own
</p>
<p>little congregations to be the only really Christian churches; and these bodies,
</p>
<p>absolutely independent even of one another, they held to owe no ecclesiastical
</p>
<p>obedience to any person, council, or other authority, between the majority of
</p>
<p>the members and the Divine Head.
</p>
<p>The Conformists included the King and the authorities i^f -^ church, who
</p>
<p>exercised lawless and tyrannical powers with remorseless vigor. The Puritans
</p>
<p>had control of the House of Commons, and were strong in literary and mer-
</p>
<p>cantile circles, as well as with the gentry and the middle classes generally.
</p>
<p>They hoped to finally gain control of the Church of England; and they were
</p>
<p>therefore the more zealous that its revenues, powers, and unity should be unim-
</p>
<p>paired. They counted among their leaders, Henry, Prince of Wales; and but
</p>
<p>for his* early death (1612), it is believed that, in 1625, the Church of England
</p>
<p>would have become a Puritan body, much in sentiment like rigid Low-Church-
</p>
<p>men of to-day. With a Puritan Henry IX, it is not probable that there would
</p>
<p>have been a Commonwealth, a Revolution, or a Brunswick succession; and it
</p>
<p>is certain that the effect on New England colonization would have been most
</p>
<p>unfavorable.
</p>
<p>The Conformist oligarchy fitfully persecuted the Puritans, but with steady
</p>
<p>cruelty pursued the " Brownists." The Puritans joined in harassing the latter
</p>
<p>(whom their House of Commons had previously voted to banish under penalty

</p>
<p>their foreign refuges, tl>c Sciiaratisi exiles received none of the sympathy and
</p>
<p>assistance so readily bestowed on fugitive Puritans. Very few Puritans, and
</p>
<p>those the more aggressive preachers, were driven from their country. The great
</p>
<p>body remained at home, hopeful of a change, and full of animosity against the
</p>
<p>" Brownists " as enemies of the true church.
</p>
<p>The Pilgrim Fathers, while in England, had been of the Separatist class,
</p>
<p>but in Holland they had followed John Robinson into Independency, so that
</p>
<p>they have been called Semi-separatists. They came to regard the Church of
</p>
<p>England, and the Presbyterian, Lutheran, Dutch Calvinist, and Huguenot bodies,
</p>
<p>all as branches of the church of Christ, to welcome godly members of them
</p>
<p>to their sacramental table, and to hold baptism by any of these orders as valid
</p>
<p>and sufficient. In short, the rigid Separatists declared for or against a man
</p>
<p>according to his church; and the Independents judged him, not by his name
</p>
<p>and affiliation, but by his individual piety.
</p>
<p>In 1620, Thomas Weston, of London, as a business venture, formed a stock
</p>
<p>company of some seventy Adventurers, for the purpose of planting the Pilgrims
</p>
<p>in America, and for seven years sharing the profits of the plantation. These
</p>
<p>Adventurers, like nearly all the mercantile people of England, were of Puritan
</p>
<p>proclivities ; * and they seem, on gathering from Weston that the Pilgrims were
</p>
<p>not of the despised "Brownists," to have hastily inferred that they were in
</p>
<p>some degree inclined to Episcopal ways.t During the colony's first year, the
</p>
<p>Adventurers apparently found that, unlike themselves, the Pilgrims were not
</p>
<p>Puritans, and thereupon they took measures to prevent the emigration of Pastor
</p>
<p>Robinson or his leading associates.
</p>
<p>The spi^s of the malcontent Puritan Adventurers soon notified them that
</p>
<p>a great many t'-ie people of Plymouth were not members of the Pilgrim
</p>
<p>church, and were ready for a different order of things. Some of the Puritan
</p>
<p>clergy (" namly, ye forward preachers") t who had a great " hank " over the
</p>
<p>Adventurers, began to think that the new colony would "grow into an eligible
</p>
<p>place for themselves. This feeling, joined to the religious zeal of the other
</p>
<p>members, induced an effort to overthrow the Independent (or Congregational)
</p>
<p>rule already established at Plymouth Rock, and to substitute some measure
</p>
<p>of the Church of England practices. This great Puritan Conspiracy of 1624,
</p>
<p>is the subject of the following pages.

</p>
<p>THE PURITAN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>In 1623, there came in the Anne, to Plymouth, Master John Oldham
</p>
<p>with his wife and eight other persons, not to unite with the colonists,
</p>
<p>but for security to live as near as might be permitted, while managing
</p>
<p>their affairs in their own way. The colonists were " generals " ; these
</p>
<p>people were "particulars." The Pilgrims, however, kindly gave the
</p>
<p>new-comers an invitation to live in their village, and share equally in
</p>
<p>its advantages, which was accepted. Oldham was an uneducated man
</p>
<p>and a blusterer, but he had native ability, and the social position
</p>
<p>indicated by the title of " Master." It is probable that the malcontent
</p>
<p>Adventurers had sent him to aid in organizing against the Congrega-
</p>
<p>tional (or Independent) rule, the elements of disaffection which Robert
</p>
<p>Hicks and others had secretly reported to exist in strength.
</p>
<p>During the ensuing winter, some slight show of discontent was
</p>
<p>caused by Oldham's counsels, but it was at once ended by Bradford's
</p>
<p>offer to change any one who wished, from a " general " to a " particular."
</p>
<p>This ended the trouble, for the petitioners had small desire for a change
</p>
<p>if they were free to make it. Still, a small faction was kept together
</p>
<p>by Oldham's assurance that a strong section of the Adventurers would
</p>
<p>see that no more supplies reached the colony, and would soon place
</p>
<p>the "particulars" in full power. It was therefore with much surprise
</p>
<p>that, in March (1624), they saw the ship Charity arrive, bringing
</p>
<p>Winslow home with ample supplies, a stock of neat cattle (of which
</p>
<p>there had before been none), a shipwright, and a salt-maker. She also
</p>
<p>brought a series of complaints, made by some returned " particulars,"
</p>
<p>and Bradford was called upon to answer them. They were briefly as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>There was much religious controversy in the colony ; family exercises
</p>
<p>on Sunday were neglected ; both sacraments were disused ; children
</p>
<p>were not catechised, or even taught to read ; the water was not whole-
</p>
<p>some ; the ground was barren, and would not bear grass ; the climate

<p>Vvas such that salt would not preserve fish, and there was hardly a fish

</p>
<p>or wild fowl to be found; thieves abounded, and so did wolves and
</p>
<p>foxes ; the Dutch were intruding on the trade ; and, finally, the people
</p>
<p>were much troubled with mosquitoes !
</p>
<p>When the ship returned^ some months later, Bradford sent his reply,
</p>
<p>which was a mixture of gravity and satire : 
</p>
<p>From the beginning, down, there had been known no controversy,
</p>
<p>public or private, on religious matters ; any neglect of family duties
</p>
<p>on the Lord's day would be rebuked, if known ; that they were de-
</p>
<p>prived of their pastor and his ministration of the sacraments, w'as
</p>
<p>grievous, for when with him, they had the communion every Sunday ;
</p>
<p>the children generally were taught in private families, and the colony
</p>
<p>desired at once to begin a "common school," for which a teacher and
</p>
<p>due support had been heretofore lacking ; the water was " as good as
</p>
<p>any in the world," though not like the beer and wine of London which
</p>
<p>the grumblers " so dearly love " ; in England was no such grass, and
</p>
<p>the cattle were already " fatt as need be," and would there were one
</p>
<p>animal for each hundred the grass would keep ; the matter of fish was
</p>
<p>too absurd, in view of the great fishing-fleet which visited the coast
</p>
<p>every year ; sundry thieves who had come in there, had " smarted well
</p>
<p>for it," but if London had reared no thieves, none of them would have
</p>
<p>got over to trouble this colony ; foxes and wolves were in many good
</p>
<p>countries, but poison and traps would thin them ; if the Dutch with
</p>
<p>commendable energy were getting a strong hold now, they would get
</p>
<p>Plymouth too, if the plantation should be broken up ; and, finally, men
</p>
<p>who could not endure the biting of a mosquito, were too delicate for
</p>
<p>founding colonies ; but this pest was really no greater than in every
</p>
<p>new place, and in time would scarcely exist.
</p>
<p>Soon after this arrival, Master Oldham went to the authorities with
</p>
<p>the confession that he had " done them wrong both by word and deed,
</p>
<p>and by writing into England." He had been assured that no further
</p>
<p>succor would be sent to the colony, but the large supplies by the
</p>
<p>Charity showed the "eminent hand of God" to be with them; his
</p>
<p>heart smote him, and those in England should no longer use him for
</p>
<p>their purposes ; he begged that the past be forgotten, and himself

</p>
<p>regarded as one of them in all things. So generous was Oldham's
</p>
<p>forgiveness, that he was even invited to meet regularly with the gov-
</p>
<p>ernor's council of five. He was probably sincere at the time, and his
</p>
<p>co-operation restored universal harmony.
</p>
<p>The Charity had also brought Master John Lyford, a Church-of-
</p>
<p>England preacher of the Puritan section, and also his wife and some
</p>
<p>four children. The plotting Adventurers had selected him as their
</p>
<p>agent. Winslow and Cushman, who knew nothing of him, had op-
</p>
<p>posed his going, but finally yielded for the sake of peace, writing
</p>
<p>home that they thought him "an honest,.plain man, though none of
</p>
<p>THE PLOT SUSPECTED. g
</p>
<p>the most eminent and rare." They had, however, arranged that he
</p>
<p>should have no pastoral position until the church should see fit to
</p>
<p>choose him to one. Of course, neither they nor their comrades ever
</p>
<p>dreamed of the conspiracy already on foot. So Lyford came at the
</p>
<p>colony's charge, and was not only housed, given an over-proportion of
</p>
<p>provisions, and provided with a servant, but, like Oldham and Elder
</p>
<p>Brewster, was invited to sit with the council. Lyford at once made
</p>
<p>his hosts ashamed 
</p>
<p>" he so bowed and cringed unto them, and would have kissed their
</p>
<p>hands if they would have suffered him ; yea, he wept and shed many
</p>
<p>tears, blessing God that had brought him to see their faces, and
</p>
<p>admiring the things they had done in their wants."
</p>
<p>Soon he professed a conversion to Congregationalism, and making
</p>
<p>" a large confession of faith," he obtained membership in their church.
</p>
<p>He offered to altogether renounce his Episcopal ordination, and
</p>
<p>declared that he should consider himself no minister unless his new
</p>
<p>church should re-ordainhim ; but Elder Brewster caused him to stop
</p>
<p>forthwith, assuring him that the Pilgrim flock required no such thing
</p>
<p>of its members as that they separate from the Church of England, but
</p>
<p>only that they separate from the world, and leave church names to
</p>
<p>care for themselves.* Still, though Lyford was not permitted to re-
</p>
<p>pudiate his Episcopal calling, he continued to bewail the alleged cor-
</p>
<p>ruptions with which he said it had entangled him, and which burdened
</p>
<p>his conscience ; and he blessed God that he had now freedom to
</p>
<p>enjoy His ordinances in their purity among His people. Although
</p>
<p>not chosen pastor, he preached in turn with Elder Brewster, and all
</p>
<p>went very smoothly.
</p>
<p>After some weeks, it was noticed that Lyford and Oldham were
</p>
<p>having much privacy with many of those not considered in sympathy
</p>
<p>with the church, and especially with the profane and less reputable
</p>
<p>attaches of the plantation, like John Billington ; and that a faction
</p>
<p>was forming under their direction. As the Charity was about to go
</p>
<p>home, it was noticed that Lyford was writing a great number of let-
</p>
<p>ters, and in that connection was often whispering to his coarse, low

</p>
<p>With the disaffection already among the Adventurers, there would be

<p>year before it could be known at Plymouth, and refuted in the ordi-
</p>
<p>nary course of things. The case required the exercise of a power
</p>
<p>which in like danger has been, and still is, exercised by all govern-
</p>
<p>ments ; and the council decided that these mysterious letters must be
</p>
<p>examined. Capt. William Peirce, of the Charity, was an earnest friend
</p>
<p>to the colony and ready to co-operate.*
</p>
<p>When the ship sailed, Bradford went in her, towing a boat for his
</p>
<p>return. Edward Winslow was on board, on his way to England as the
</p>
<p>colony's agent. Peirce having produced the letters, there were found
</p>
<p>to be more than twenty from Lyford, filled with malicious falsehood,
</p>
<p>in furtherance of a plan for the " ruin and utter subversion " of the
</p>
<p>colony. Oldham was a poor writer and had sent little ; but some third
</p>
<p>person had notified a friend that Mr. Lyford and Mr. Oldham in-
</p>
<p>tended a reformation in church and commonwealth, and that so soon
</p>
<p>as the ship had gone, they would begin by forming a new congrega-
</p>
<p>tion. Of most of these letters copies were taken, and the originals
</p>
<p>sent forward ; but to prevent Lyford's denying the genuineness of the
</p>
<p>correspondence, some of the worst originals 'were retained, and true
</p>
<p>copies sent.
</p>
<p>After Lyford and his family had embarked at Gravesend for Amer-
</p>
<p>ica, Winslow had left in the cabin a letter from himself to Pastor
</p>
<p>Robinson, and one from an English friend to Elder Brewster. Ly-
</p>
<p>ford, already at work as a spy, had purloined these letters, copied
</p>
<p>them, and resealing them, had restored them to their place without
</p>
<p>discovery. The copies with "scurrilous and flouting annotations," he
</p>
<p>was now sending to his friend, John Pemberton, a Puritan minister,
</p>
<p>and the colony's " adversary." These papers were also taken for
</p>
<p>evidence. Having transacted this business, and left Winslow and
</p>
<p>Peirce to look after the case in England, Bradford returned in his
</p>
<p>boat. His errand had been suspected, and the conspirators expected
</p>
<p>to be called to account ; but when weeks went by with no sign, they
</p>
<p>concluded that the governor had only made a parting call on his
</p>
<p>friend Peirce, and was still not only without any evidence of their
</p>
<p>conspiracy, but without any suspicion of it.

<p>As they supposed their faction able to sway a majority of votes in
</p>
<p>town-meeting, they began in a skirmishing way to pick quarrels with
</p>
<p>the officers, and to show "great malignancy." Thus, Oldham, when
</p>
<p>civilly called to take his turn to watch, refused obedience to the cap-
</p>
<p>tain, upon whom he drew a knife, calling him a "rascal," a "beggarly

</p>
<p>and rebels, and other such foul language/' says Bradford, " as I am
</p>
<p>ashamed to remember." But Oldham yielded when " clapt up " for a
</p>
<p>little while. He seems to have expected a popular demonstration in
</p>
<p>his favorj and to have found not one voice raised in his behalf. Next,
</p>
<p>the original plan was tried. On a Sunday, Lyford, ignoring the pub-
</p>
<p>lic worship, assembled his followers, and held a meeting under that
</p>
<p>ordination which he had so recently disclaimed and denounced in
</p>
<p>the public assembly. Pains seem to have been taken to make the
</p>
<p>schism especially offensive, with "insolent carriages," which are not
</p>
<p>described.
</p>
<p>The sedition had broken out in the very way foretold in one of the
</p>
<p>letters, and it behooved the government to act for self-preservation,
</p>
<p>before the entering wedge should be followed by a second. A "court"
</p>
<p>of the whole company, or a town-meeting, was called. It probably
</p>
<p>was held in the fort-church on the hill, and little imagination is needed
</p>
<p>to picture the assembly : Bradford presides, with his council sitting by
</p>
<p>him on the platform ; Standish acts as marshal, and as is done at the
</p>
<p>Sunday gatherings in that place, a quarter of the men come in military
</p>
<p>order, fully armed ; a sentinel is kept day and night on the roof of the
</p>
<p>church, where the artillery is ranged behind a rampart, and his tread
</p>
<p>is heard in the intervals of business ; some 80 men of the colony are
</p>
<p>present, with several full-grown lads and a few visiting strangers, of
</p>
<p>whom nothing is known to us ; many of those present are full of won-
</p>
<p>der as to the object of the meeting, and some who know of it, like
</p>
<p>good Deacon Fuller, the surgeon, feel sure that Brother Lyford will
</p>
<p>set himself right ; the governor is fearful as to the extent of the defec-
</p>
<p>tion among the many voters outside the colony's church ; and the
</p>
<p>arch-conspirators, counting on a majority, confident that there is no
</p>
<p>positive evidence of their plot, are bold and hopeful ; throughout the
</p>
<p>meeting generally, there is a pent-up excitement, with a feverish"
</p>
<p>anxiety as to the mysterious something about to take place.
</p>
<p>In opening, Bradford in general terms charged Lyford and Oldham

</p>
<p>with plotting to destroy the government. They both made a square
</p>
<p>denial, and indignantly demanded his proof. They were referred to
</p>
<p>what had been publicly seen of their actions. Oldham was reminded
</p>
<p>that he had come, not as a colonist, but on his private account ; yet
</p>
<p>he and his had been taken into the village, which they had not
</p>
<p>expected ; and in trying to bring ruin on those who in his days of
</p>
<p>weakness had so kindly received him to their homes and councils, he
</p>
<p>was guilty of ingratitude as well as treachery. Lyford, with a large
</p>
<p>12 THE PURITAN CONSPIRACV.
</p>
<p>family, had been brought over and maintained at the i)ublic expense,
</p>
<p>and by his own seeking he was in church-membership witli them ; for
</p>
<p>him to plot their ruin, was most perfidious.
</p>
<p>The culprits supposing that Bradford had put in his whole case,
</p>
<p>were probably surprised that he had discovered nothing definite.
</p>
<p>Lyford then proceeded to renew his denial, declaring that he knew
</p>
<p>nothing of the colony's English enemies, or their plans, nor had he
</p>
<p>any relations whatever with them ; and that he should be suspected
</p>
<p>of any collusion with them, filled him with astonishment. Then, for
</p>
<p>the first time, his letters were produced ; and some having been read
</p>
<p>before the men who had so often heard in that place his prayers and
</p>
<p>sermons, he stood convicted of treachery, knavery, hypocrisy, and
</p>
<p>persistent lying. The sudden exposure overwhelmed him, and he
</p>
<p>became speechless. But Oldham's courage rose with the emergency,
</p>
<p>and he determined to try immediate conclusions with the government.
</p>
<p>Denouncing the opening of his letters and threatening revenge, he
</p>
<p>sought to rally his friends by imperiously shouting, " My masters,
</p>
<p>where are your hearts ? Now show your courage ! You have often
</p>
<p>complained to me, thus and so ! Now is the time ! If }ou will do
</p>
<p>anything, I will stand by you ! " Many restless but not ill-meaning
</p>
<p>spirits had been flattered by the confidential manners of Oldham and
</p>
<p>Lyford ; but now that the plot was unmasked, they recoiled. Others
</p>
<p>who would not have been unfavorable to a successful rebellion, had
</p>
<p>no inclination to a losing side. So when Oldham, at the close of his
</p>
<p>vehement call, stood before the assembly and glared at his recent
</p>
<p>associates, not one voice was raised in his favor. A dead silence was
</p>
<p>the effectual answer.
</p>
<p>Bradford then demanded Lyford's opinion as to the propriety of
</p>
<p>opening the suspected letters. The culprit knew that the two copies
</p>
<p>he had surreptitiously made of Winslow's letters, must be in Bradford's
</p>
<p>package, and would condemn him if he should censure Bradford's
</p>
<p>act ; so he remained silent. The governor then explained to the
</p>
<p>people the necessity of this seizure of correspondence,  that he might
</p>
<p>ward ofi the "mischief and ruin" which the "conspiracy" sought to

</p>
<p>bring on " this poor colony." He then caused one of his associates
</p>
<p>to read all the letters, and exhibit those in Lyford's handj and also to
</p>
<p>show the manner in which Lyford had opened the letters of others.
</p>
<p>The public astonishment now increased.
</p>
<p>These letters, in much detail, charged official wastefulness, negli-
</p>
<p>gence, caprice, and general mismanagement of the joint-stock inter-
</p>
<p>ests. One accusation drew from Bradford a very interesting declara-
</p>
<p>tion, and one doubly important from the publicity with which it was
</p>
<p>LYFORD CALLS FOR RECRUITS. 1 3
</p>
<p>now made. Lyford had written that the church would have none
</p>
<p>remain in Plymouth but Separatists. Bradford denounced this asser-
</p>
<p>tion as "a false calumniation"; he called attention to the fact, that
</p>
<p>there were then present many citizens that were not Separatists and
</p>
<p>who were highly esteemed, the colony being "glad of their company"
</p>
<p>and desirous of receiving any like them. This statement, joined to
</p>
<p>Lyford's claim that the non-Separatists were in the majority, will give
</p>
<p>many readers a new idea of Pilgrim toleration. It is a curious fact,
</p>
<p>that Lyford charged the Plymouth authorities with discouraging the
</p>
<p>non-churchmembers from attending worship, even on Sunday, and
</p>
<p>with resenting his endeavor to get the people generally to attend the
</p>
<p>preaching. Bradford actually felt called upon to refute this, and to
</p>
<p>show that church-going was compulsory. The unfriends of the Pil-
</p>
<p>grim Fathers, in those days, generally inveighed against them as being
</p>
<p>lax themselves, and as shamefully neglecting to enforce religious
</p>
<p>observances and instruction on their associates and subordinates. It
</p>
<p>was little thought that two hundred and sixty years later, the self-same
</p>
<p>Pilgrims would be the subject of halting, shame-faced apology from
</p>
<p>their own descendants, as having exceeded their generation in rigidity
</p>
<p>of doctrine and severity of practice !
</p>
<p>Lyfoid also urged his English principals to hurry over all the
</p>
<p>settlers they could ; even servants should be made shareholders, at
</p>
<p>least in form ; but Robinson and his people must be kept back, and
</p>
<p>for fear of their private embarkation, neither Winslow nor Peirce
</p>
<p>should longer go in the ship. Thus could he gain colonists enough
</p>
<p>to vote down and suppress the Congregational element. If a captain
</p>
<p>whom they had spoken of, should come over "as a general,"  /. e.
</p>
<p>one of the general colonists,  he would be chosen commander;
</p>
<p>"for," said Lyford, "this Captain Standish looks like a silly boy, and
</p>
<p>is in utter contempt." (This passage may have caused a smile, but
</p>
<p>probably not on the face of the choleric little captain.) If these rein-
</p>
<p>forcements did not come, Lyford and his friends must move to a
</p>
<p>place across the harbor, or fuse with the original settlers  vce ?iobis !
</p>
<p>Lyford was then urged to produce any evidence, however slight, to

</p>
<p>sustain even the least of his charges ; and he and his friends were
</p>
<p>offered every opportunity to do this, or to present any other complaint
</p>
<p>or grievance. They were reminded that all the men of the colony
</p>
<p>were present, and therefore any witnesses they could name, would at
</p>
<p>once appear. The governor desired that he and his associates should
</p>
<p>not be spared in any respect, if any one had anything to say against
</p>
<p>their conduct. The opportunity was full and free, and there were
</p>
<p>impartial strangers present to listen. But no one responded, until

</p>
<p>TIIK PURITAN' CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>Lyford, in a liiinible tone, began to say that certain rf)niplainants
</p>
<p>had ahuscil his confidence and led him to misuse his real friends ;
</p>
<p>and he accused liillington and others of decei\ ing him. These men
</p>
<p>earnestly denied his statements, and protested that he was wronging
</p>
<p>them ; they had indeed been drawn into some of his meetings, but
</p>
<p>had refused their consent to his conspiracies. Probably Lyford was
</p>
<p>then beginning to tell the truth ; l)ut those whom he had taught to be
</p>
<p>false to their own brethren, were not the men to stand by him in his
</p>
<p>disgrace.
</p>
<p>It was a fearful humiliation to the university-trained divine, when
</p>
<p>publicly denounced as a traitor and a liar by a vulgar brawler like
</p>
<p>Billington, to know that such men as Bradford and Brewster, Fuller
</p>
<p>and Warren, Standish, Rowland, Alden, and Prence, all believed his
</p>
<p>low-lived accuser, whom they despised much less than they did him-
</p>
<p>self. Bradford then summed up Lyford's knavery and hypocrisy,
</p>
<p>especially in religious matters, and fully set forth what had been
</p>
<p>proved in the case. Oldham had some conscience, but no shame.
</p>
<p>Lyford, technically a gentleman, though conscienceless, had a class
</p>
<p>pride ; and as he stood, the focus of all eyes, so thoroughly convicted
</p>
<p>that not a voice uttered a word in his favor, the ignominy over-
</p>
<p>whelmed him. One may imagine the disgust of the stalwart Oldham,
</p>
<p>when his fellow-conspirator burst into tears, and began to bewail and
</p>
<p>confess to the meeting that his letters were " false and naught both
</p>
<p>for matter and manner'' ; that he feared he was a reprobate ; that his
</p>
<p>sins were so great as to make him doubt of God's pardon ; and that
</p>
<p>he was " unsavory salt."
</p>
<p>The meeting quickly rendered its verdict, but it is not known
</p>
<p>whether there were any dissenting votes.* The sentence was, that
</p>
<p>Oldham be banished forthwith ; but that his family might remain till
</p>
<p>he had a comfortable home for them. Lyford was to go at the end of
</p>
<p>six months; but it was really intended to pardon him, if his repentance
</p>
<p>should seem genuine. He promptly took occasion, before the church,
</p>
<p>to more fully confess his wrong-doing, shedding abundant tears, and

<p>charging himself with envy and malice towards his brethren ; he said
</p>
<p>he had counted on the great body of the people to help him carry his
</p>
<p>points with violence, and God might justly charge him with shedding
</p>
<p>innocent blood, for he knew not what might have come, had not his
</p>
<p>writings been stayed, and he blessed God that they were stopped ;
</p>
<p>God might justly make him a vagabond, like Cain. His effusive con-

</p>
<p>trition produced such a sentiment in his favor that he was permitted
</p>
<p>to resume preaching ; and warm-hearted Deacon Fuller, and others,
</p>
<p>declared a readiness to sue on their knees for his pardon. The
</p>
<p>stormy sky became once more serene ; but in a few weeks, from that
</p>
<p>clear sky there dropped a thunderbolt.
</p>
<p>About September ist, when that calamitous craft, the Little James,
</p>
<p>was ready to return to London, one of her company brought to the
</p>
<p>governor a letter which Lyford was seeking to forward by him. Self-
</p>
<p>preservation required an examination of this missive ; and forthwith
</p>
<p>was revealed an astonishing depth of depravity. Lyford was now,
</p>
<p>with many professions of pious concern, assuring the malcontent Ad-
</p>
<p>venturers that his forgiving hosts at Plymouth were full of " indirect
</p>
<p>courses " and '^ injurious dealing " towards them, and were audacious
</p>
<p>to "darken ye truth " with "great pretenses " and equivocation in many
</p>
<p>things. " Ye church (as they call themselves)," though " ye smallest
</p>
<p>number in the colon}-," deprived the majority of the means of salva-
</p>
<p>tion, and held to no ministry for the conversion of the people gener-
</p>
<p>ally, and poor souls were complaining of it with tears to him, and he
</p>
<p>was under censure for preaching" to all comers. As to his former let-
</p>
<p>ters, which he had so often and so tearfully recanted and denounced
</p>
<p>before his congregation, he now said : 
</p>
<p>" I suppose my letters, or at least the copies of them, are come to
</p>
<p>your hands, for so they here report ; which if it be so, I pray you take
</p>
<p>notice of this, that I have written nothing but what is certainly true/"
</p>
<p>Once more, the governor wrote a long defense of the colony, and
</p>
<p>sent it with the letter, as well as a full exposure of Lyford's acts.
</p>
<p>This last letter, of course, ended all thought of pardon ; but another
</p>
<p>result of it was startling. Mrs. Lyford, a worthy matron, was so mor-
</p>
<p>bidly affected, that in her distraction she went to one of the deacons
</p>
<p>and made frightful revelations as to her husband's licentiousness,
</p>
<p>before and after marriage. While he was a suitor, she had a hint
</p>
<p>that he had contracted parental responsibilities, but he satisfied her
</p>
<p>scruples by taking an oath that he was not guilty ; yet after marriage,
</p>
<p>the story not only proved true, but the child was brought to their

</p>
<p>home for support. And afterwards, her constant vigilance over her
</p>
<p>maid-servants had been required on his account, and had not always
</p>
<p>been effectual. She confirmed her statements before some other per-
</p>
<p>sons, and was overcome by the fear that a judgment was pursuing her
</p>
<p>on her husband's account. Lyford remained at Plymouth during the
</p>
<p>winter, probably living still from the public stores ; he then joined
</p>
<p>Oldham, who was domiciled at Nantasket (Hull), where were some

</p>
<p>straggling settlers. Strange to say, some of their former friends
</p>
<p>remained steadfast, and voluntarily removed with them. Among
</p>
<p>these was Roger Conant, who became the brave and worthy founder
</p>
<p>of Salem, and who seems, at this time, to have been so rigid against
</p>
<p>Separatists, that he could in preference condone Lyford's wickedness
</p>
<p>and accept his ministrations.
</p>
<p>In March, 1625, Oldham, in defiance of his sentence, sailed into
</p>
<p>Plymouth with some strangers, and soon began to assail the people
</p>
<p>with such abusive language, that even his comrades rebuked him ; but
</p>
<p>all reproofs were as " oyle to ye fire," and he went on in " his mad
</p>
<p>fury " denouncing the settlers as " a hundred rebels and traitors."
</p>
<p>The madman was committed until his senses had returned. Then
</p>
<p>he was led to his boat between two rows of musketeers, each as he
</p>
<p>]xassed expediting him by an ignominious " thump " with a gun ; and
</p>
<p>at his embarkation they bade him "goe and mende his maners."
</p>
<p>So thoroughly did Oldham absorb public attention, that no one
</p>
<p>noticed the arrival from England of the ship Jacob ; and when Old-
</p>
<p>ham was about running the gauntlet, Winslow landed with Master
</p>
<p>William Peirce, entirely unobserved until they appeared in the crowd.
</p>
<p>They soon made an addition to the excitement. On reaching Lon-
</p>
<p>don, the last summer, with their report of Lyford's acts, they had
</p>
<p>been violently assailed by his friends, who declared it a great scandal
</p>
<p>that " a minister, a man so godly," should be so aspersed ; and a suit
</p>
<p>for slander was threatened. At length, a hearing was had before a
</p>
<p>meeting of the Adventurers, at which two moderators jointly presided,
</p>
<p> Lyford's friends choosing Mr. White, a lawyer, and his opponents
</p>
<p>selecting Mr. Hooker, a preacher, both eminent men. The case
</p>
<p>attracted a crowd of outside partisans.
</p>
<p>In the course of the meeting, Winslow, in some warmth, said that
</p>
<p>Lyford had " dealt knavishly." Upon that, Lyford's friends broke
</p>
<p>out, demanding that those present witness that Winslow had '' cald a
</p>
<p>minister of ye gospell knave'' and they would " prosecute law upon
</p>
<p>it." When the tumult had abated, Winslow called to the stand two
</p>
<p>strangers, who had been made known to him. They were from

<p>Lyford's Puritan parish in the t:nglish pale of Ireland. He was there
</p>
<p>guilty of an especially flagrant act, involving the betrayal of a young
</p>
<p>parishioner who was intending marriage with another of his flock, and
</p>
<p>his then promoting the union. The victim being driven by remorse
</p>
<p>to confession, Lyford fled in fear of retribution, and reached England
</p>
<p>in time to be picked up and sent to Plymouth by the Adventurers,
</p>
<p>who of course knew nothing of this transaction. These two "godly
</p>
<p>and grave" gentlemen having very modestly but clearly given the par-
</p>
<p>EPISCOPAL SALEM.
</p>
<p>17
</p>
<p>ticulars, Lyford's friends became mute with shame. The moderators
</p>
<p>then joined in deciding that Lyford's conduct at Plymouth had fully
</p>
<p>justified his condemnation there ; but what had now come to light,
</p>
<p>proved his unfitness for the ministry forever after, no matter what
</p>
<p>repentance he might express. The subject was then dismissed ; but
</p>
<p>the ill-feeling not only survived, but caused the Adventurers to fall
</p>
<p>apart, so that the great majority wholly abandoned the colony's
</p>
<p>interests.
</p>
<p>Not many months after Lyford's withdrawal to Nantasket, that
</p>
<p>worthy Puritan divine. White, at the English Dorchester, heard thai
</p>
<p>the exiles had left Plymouth through some distaste of Separation.
</p>
<p>To Puritan prejudice, this seemed a quite sufficient recommendation.
</p>
<p>In 1623, White (through the Dorchester company) had caused four-
</p>
<p>teen of the fishermen to winter at Cape Ann (Gloucester)  the next
</p>
<p>year (1624), he gave the place the character of a settlement ; in 1625,
</p>
<p>he provided it with twelve neat cattle, and he invited Lyford to go
</p>
<p>there as pastor, Roger Conant as superintendent, and Oldham as
</p>
<p>overseer of trade. The first two went, but Oldham preferred trading
</p>
<p>on his own account. At the end of 1625, this plantation, which had
</p>
<p>sunk ^^3420, was abandoned. Conant, taking a few of the men and the
</p>
<p>outfit, then founded what is now Salem, Lyford going as their minister
</p>
<p>and serving as such until 1629. Some readers may be surprised to
</p>
<p>learn that for the first three years of its existence, that ancient town
</p>
<p>worshipped exclusively in the form of the Church of England, as also
</p>
<p>at that time did all the scattered settlers around Boston Bay.
</p>
<p>Thus ended the great Puritan conspiracy against the church which
</p>
<p>the Pilgrims had planted with such heroic sacrifices, and watered with
</p>
<p>such sacred tears ; and against that government which they had
</p>
<p>planted on the principle then novel among rulers,  the equality of
</p>
<p>all men before the law. Plymouth lost something by the withdrawal
</p>
<p>of a few men like Roger Conant, and by the enmity of the Adven-
</p>
<p>turers; bat she gained much more by the increased zeal of those who
</p>
<p>remained ; for many who had hitherto stood aloof from her religious

<p>organization, felt called upon to rally to its defense and join in its
</p>
<p>membership ; and all felt a new respect for their government, gen-
</p>
<p>erally so mild, but which had proved so vigorous in the time of peril
</p>
<p>Thus came it, that this momentous year of 1624, closed on a scene of
</p>
<p>harmony which was long to continue.
</p>
<p>\\'hat might have been, had Lyford's place been filled by some
</p>
<p>liberal, worthy churchman ? It is hardly probable that Plymouth's

<p>ceremonials  her formal informality  had become very firmly fixed.

<p>It is certain that in Holland the Pilgrims had invited to their com-

<p>Robinson in his farewell remarks had suggested the employment of
</p>
<p>some Nonconformist minister by his people during his absence, and
</p>
<p>had advised them to seek union with the gotily part of the English
</p>
<p>churchmen,  advice in which he was consistent, for it is recorded that
</p>
<p>he honored the godly ministers of the Church of England " above all
</p>
<p>other the professors of religion," for " his spirit cleaved unto them,"
</p>
<p>and he urged "sweet communion" with them.* Already in Plymouth
</p>
<p>were many " not of the Separation," and, as Bradford records, the
</p>
<p>Pilgrims "were glad of their company." Might not such a congrega-
</p>
<p>tion have slowly yielded in externals to a ministry of united wisdom,
</p>
<p>strength, love, and devotion? But unfortunately^ those ordinances

<p>acknowledgment of all the wrongs which
</p>
<p>he had done, or meant to do, to the
</p>
<p>people of Plymouth ; as he had sought
</p>
<p>their ruin, he said, God had now met
</p>
<p>with him and might destroy him ; yea,
</p>
<p>he feared they all were faring the worse
</p>
<p>for his sake ; and he solemnly vowed to
</p>
<p>make amends, if God would forgive him.
</p>
<p>The vessel was saved, though turned
</p>
<p>back, and Oldham, strange to say, re-
</p>
<p>membered his pledge, lie treated the
</p>
<p>riymouth people with "an honorable
</p>
<p>respect," and once more declared the
</p>
<p>hand of God to bo with them. He re.
</p>
<p>ceived full permission to conic and go,
</p>
<p>and when, in 1628, the colony sent a
</p>
<p>state-prisoner to England, they entrust-
</p>
<p>ed him and the evidence against him, to
</p>
<p>their friend 01dham,who then went over.
</p>
<p>Oldham became a man of some note
</p>
<p>in the colony of Massachusetts Bay, and
</p>
<p>a member of its church, which, while
</p>
<p>"separating," vehemently disclaimed
</p>
<p>" Separation." He was a member of the
</p>
<p>first general court of magistrates and
</p>
<p>representatives which met at Boston, he
</p>
<p>being a " deputy " from Watertown. His
</p>
<p>chief employment was trading with the
</p>
<p>Narragansets, in connection with which
</p>
<p>he bought in their bay, of Canonicus, the
</p>
<p>beautiful island of one thousand acres,
</p>
<p>now called Prudence. Thereabouts, in
</p>
<p>1634, Master William Peirce went with
</p>
<p>the Rebecca, to bring away five hundred
</p>
<p>bushels of corn which Oldham had ac-

<p>and methods which, in an unnatural alliance with the cruelty and

<p>rapacity of bailiffs, had only been known to the seniors in the long-
</p>

</p>
<p>vices, and sacrilege.
</p>
<p>There are those of us, yielding to none in loyalty to our ancestors,

<p>and feeling that, if we had been with them, we should have been of

<p>them, who regret the perversion of this opportunity to win them to
</p>
<p>perhaps some partial use of "that form of sound words,'"  a form
</p>
<p>Separatists were taught to regard as one of "stinted prayers" and
</p>
<p>" dumb reading," but which three centuries of churchmen have' found
</p>
<p>so ample for devotion, so increasingly rich in associations, and so
</p>
<p>grateful in all the conditions of humanity. Yet our fathers' ways

<p>were sanctified to them. Judge them by their works, through which,

<p>two young sons and a hired man. His
</p>
<p>lire-arms were two guns and two pis-
</p>
<p>tols, and for these he had only duck-
</p>
<p>shot. As he bore down, the savages
</p>
<p>stood ready to repel him with their sto-
</p>
<p>len weapons, but his shot so galled them,
</p>
<p>that they all ran below. Then, arm-

<p>ing his bow with his anchor, Gallop
</p>
<p>came on with all speed, and " rammed "

<p>leaped into the sea and were drowned ;

<p>Then, ranging alongside, Gallop grap-

<p>in his own hold. Next was taken the

</p>
<p>quickly released each other), he con-
</p>
<p>sulted safety by casting him into the
</p>
<p>sea.
</p>
<p>The two surviving pirates remaining
</p>
<p>concealed in Oldham's hold, Gallop ven-
</p>
<p>tured on board, for he had seen a man's
</p>
<p>body in the stern-sheets, hidden under a
</p>
<p>seine. While his crew covered him with
</p>
<p>their fire-arms, he examined the body,
</p>
<p>which was still warm, though the head
</p>
<p>was cleft, and the hands and feet had
</p>
<p>been in process of ami)utation when the
</p>
<p>attack began. The head was too bloody
</p>
<p>for recognition, and Gallop proceeded
</p>
<p>to wash it. Soon he exclaimed, "Ah,
</p>
<p>Brother Oldham ! Is it thou ? I am re-
</p>
<p>solved to avenge thy blood ! "
</p>
<p>Oldham, while peacefully trading, had
</p>
<p>been surprised and assassinated for the
</p>
<p>sake of plunder. His two Indian em-
</p>
<p>ployes had betrayed him ; and two boys,
</p>
<p>his kinsmen, who were with him, had
</p>
<p>been sent on shore as prisoners, but
</p>
<p>were eventually recovered through
</p>
<p>Roger Williams.
</p>
<p>Oldham's body was buried in the sea,
</p>
<p>which had just swallowed eleven of his
</p>
<p>murderers. The waves becoming too
</p>
<p>high for towing the pinnace home, ev-
</p>
<p>erything accessible was removed for the
</p>
<p>benefit of Oldham's family, and then she
</p>
<p>was set adrift. She reached the land in

</p>
<p>"THE PILGRIM REPUBLIC,
</p>
<p>A// Historical Review of the Colony of Neiv Plymojith,''
</p>
<p>By Hon. John A. Goodwin, Trustee of Pilgrim Society of Plymouth, President
</p>
<p>of Lowell Shakspere Club, ex-Speaker of Massachusetts House of Represen-
</p>
<p>tatives, etc. ; also. Editor of Vox Popiili, Lowell, Mass.
</p>
<p>Recent discoveries have so completely changed the known history of the
</p>
<p>Pilgrim Fathers, that no book on the subject, issued so long as thirty-five
</p>
<p>years ago, is of much value. Until the researches in Europe of Hunter and
</p>
<p>Dexter, and the discovery of Bradford's History in 1855, many of the leading
</p>
<p>facts were unknown, and many more misunderstood. Within the time men-
</p>
<p>tioned, a degree of study and investigation has been brought to bear, which
</p>
<p>is loudly calling for a reconstruction of the Pilgrim narrative, in a form for
</p>
<p>the general reader.
</p>
<p>Mr. Goodwin has long been an enthusiastic student of this subject, and also
</p>
<p>a persistent explorer of the Old Colony, by sea and by land, endeavoring to
</p>
<p>verify by observation every topographical point. He is better known as a
</p>
<p>public speaker, a parliamentarian, and a journalist, than as the mariner and
</p>
<p>traveller that he was in early life ; but this prior experience has been of
</p>
<p>no small aid in his historical pursuits.
</p>
<p>While he modestly terms his work " An Historical Review," it is in fact
</p>
<p>a very complete history, in popular form, of the Pilgrims in their English
</p>
<p>homes, their Dutch halting-place, and their development at Plymouth into a
</p>
<p>permanent community. The subsequent affairs of the colony are also sketched
</p>
<p>with fullness, down to its dissolution in 1692.
</p>
<p>This work does not interfere with that just issued by Mr Davis; forwhile
</p>
<p>the latter deals with the local matters of the town of Plymouth, and espe-
</p>
<p>cially its genealogies, " The Pilgrim Republic " treats of the whole colony, its
</p>
<p>European origin, and its New England relations. In fact, one happily sup-
</p>
<p>plements the other. Of Mr. Goodwin's work. Rev. Dr. Dexter expresses the
</p>
<p>opinion that "it will meet, extremely well, a popular need"; and it is strongly
</p>
<p>commended by Judge Russell, President of the Pilgrim Society, and Hon. Amos
</p>
<p>Perry, Secretary of the Rhode Island Historical Society.
</p>
<p>The volume will be a large octavo, of about 500 pages, neatly Ijound, and
</p>
<p>printed on heavy tinted paper, in old-style type. Price $3.00 a copy. Orders
