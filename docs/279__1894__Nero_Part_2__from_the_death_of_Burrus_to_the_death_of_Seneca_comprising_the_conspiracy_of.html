<p>SCENE I.

<p>(As prologue.]
</p>
<p>ThrasecCs house.
</p>
<p>Priscus.
</p>
<p>Thrasca and
</p>
<p>THRASEA.
</p>
<p>HAT is it, Priscus, that hath led thee now
</p>
<p>To pledge my ear to closer secrecy
</p>
<p>Than what thy loving trust always com-
</p>
<p>mands ?
</p>
<p>PR. I fear to tell.
</p>
<p>THR. Suppose then I tell thee.
</p>
<p>I know thy sickness, and I hold the cure.
</p>
<p>PR. Nay, sir : I rank among the incurables.
</p>
<p>THR. Bravo ! that is well said. I have watched
</p>
<p>thee, Priscus,
</p>
<p>All the six years I have known thee  'tis six years :
</p>
<p>I have seen thine eye grow steadier, and thy smile
</p>
<p>Softer and kinder, and thy speech, which once
</p>
<p>Crackled in flame and smoke, liath stilled to a fire
</p>
<p>That comforts my old age. Even as thy body
</p>
<p>Hath filled to firmness, and its gait grown stately,
</p>
<p>So is thy mind, which ripened manners clothe
</p>
<p>In rich reserve. . .
</p>
<p>PR. What wilt thou say?
</p>
<p>THR. Hearken! 'tis some days since
</p>
<p>I have noted thy disturbance and rejoiced.
</p>
<p>'Tis ill with them, who quake not at the touch
</p>
<p>Of the world's Creator. Thou hast come to tell me
</p>
<p>Thou lov'st my daughter.
</p>
<p>PR. Ah, sir !
</p>
<p>THR. Is'tnotso?
</p>
<p>truth.

<p>PR. Her name is the oath whereby I seal all
</p>
<p>THR. And well : thou'rt worthy of her ; ]in saying
</p>
<p>which
</p>
<p>I mean thy praise, for she is worthy of thee.
</p>
<p>Nay, while she lives I go not from the world ;
</p>
<p>Death sucks me not, though on his iron ladder - 5
</p>
<p>My years descend : she will be Thiasea still
</p>
<p>Without his struggles. Let me acquaint thee, son,
</p>
<p>With one condition which I have thought to make,
</p>
<p>Ere I commit her to thy trust.
</p>
<p>PR. Good Thrasea,
</p>
<p>I know not how to thank thee ; but, forgive me,
</p>
<p>My secret was not this.
</p>
<p>THR. Not this ?
</p>
<p>PR. Nay, sir.
</p>
<p>Of late I have passed my life half in a dungeon,
</p>
<p>Half in the garden, where thou bidst me forth
</p>
<p>To bask in my love's joy : which in my duty
</p>
<p>I had spoken of to thee openly, but all
</p>
<p>Hath come so quickly : now, a happier way,
</p>
<p>I meet thy favour unsolicited.
</p>
<p>Let nothing vex this hour ; I long to hear
</p>
<p>Thy one requirement, which my full consent
</p>
<p>Leaps to embrace unheard, that thou mayst join
</p>
<p>Fannia and me.
</p>
<p>THR. 'Tis but a form. I ask
</p>
<p>A promise of thee, Priscus, that thou wilt not
</p>
<p>For ten years join any conspiracy
</p>
<p>Against the Emperor.
</p>
<p>PR. Why?
</p>
<p>THR. For Fannia's sake,
</p>
<p>Lest Nero kill thee : and for thy sake too.
</p>
<p>PR. And why ten years ?
</p>
<p>THR. Ten years is a fair term.

<p>The Second Part of Nero.
</p>
<p>Act I. i, i.
</p>
<p>PR. Seneca.
</p>
<p>THR. Seine;,'. Seneca! Hath he consented?
</p>
<p>J'R. We at* such, sir, as can win him.
</p>
<p>77/ A'. Why, I know you ;
</p>
<p>The senatorial patriots. Ther'll he Lucan,
</p>
<p>Cassius and Lateranus, Fsenius Ruins,
</p>
<p>Flavus, perhaps Vestinus . . .
</p>
<p>PR. Who they he
</p>
<p>Will presently be seen.
</p>
<p>THR. (), I am in time
</p>
<p>To stay you yet. This plot is merely mischief,
</p>
<p>Seneca's death.
</p>
<p>PR. Not if 'tis Nero's death.
</p>
<p>THR. Think man ! If first ye go to" Seneca,
</p>
<p>Ere ye slay Nero, he will not consent :
</p>
<p>Never, be sure. And if ye first slay Nero,
</p>
<p>Seneca's nowhere. Others will spring up,
</p>
<p>Piso, and all the Augustan family,
</p>
<p>Plautus, Silanus . . .
</p>
<p>PR. But if Seneca
</p>
<p>Consent . . .
</p>
<p>THR. What ! to that crime ?
</p>
<p>PR. He hath consented
</p>
<p>To like before.
</p>
<p>I'll R. Well, but the wrongs he hath done
</p>
<p>His pride alloys, or in pretensed retirement
</p>
<p>Repudiates ; and, could he feel his guilt, 10 "
</p>
<p>That were remorse, whose sick and painful palsy
</p>
<p>Cannot raise hand to strike. Think you that he,
</p>
<p>Who laughed at Claudius' death ; who let be slain
</p>
<p>His old friend and protectress Agrippina ;
</p>
<p>Who glozed the murder of Biitannicus ;

<p>Who hid his protest when Octavia fell ;
</p>
<p>That he will turn about and say, ' Such things
</p>
<p>' I did for Nero, and the good of Rome :
</p>
<p>' Now, since he sings at Naples on the stage,
</p>
<p>' I do repent me, and will kill my pupil ;
</p>
<p>' Will take myself the power I made for him,
</p>
<p>' And show how I intended he should rule ! '
</p>
<p>This were a Roman but not Seneca.
</p>
<p>PR. We look not for it of him.
</p>
<p>THR. 'Tis all one.
</p>
<p>Seneca ! the millionaire !
</p>
<p>PR. If he consent,
</p>
<p>We restore the republic.
</p>
<p>THR. The Republic !
</p>
<p>The Decii and Camilli will you bring us ?
</p>
<p>That kingly yeoman, frugal Curius?
</p>
<p>Can you restore the brave considerate Gracchi,
</p>
<p>And Cato's stern unconquerable soul ? . .
</p>
<p>O nay : but Seneca the imperialist !
</p>
<p>Priscus, if Seneca refuse, thou'lt make
</p>
<p>A promise for ten years ?
</p>
<p>PR. With that reserve,
</p>
<p>And wilt thou not say five years?
</p>
<p>THR. I'll say five,
</p>
<p>If thou wilt promise.
</p>
<p>PR. Then, if Seneca 125
</p>
<p>Refuse, I pledge myself to take no part
</p>
<p>In any plot against the emperor
</p>
<p>For five years.

</p>
<p>his head, and ei ! ei ! (Screams. All laugh loudly.)
</p>
<p>PRO. Hell and thunder ! Silence there !
</p>
<p>Mar. (to themselves). Why, if we mayn't laugh
</p>
<p>in the theater, nor out of it !
</p>
<p>PRO. {to officers). Here's a gentleman, who would
</p>
<p>go to sea to escape being shaken. Shall we take
</p>
<p>him a cruise ?
</p>
<p>1st Off. Frightened by the earthquake, sir ? I do
</p>
<p>not blame you.
</p>
<p>SEo. When the gods shake your city, as a
</p>
<p>terrier does a rat.
</p>
<p>15/ Off. But how should the sea cure you ? 'Tis
</p>
<p>their common plaything.
</p>
<p>PRO. Indeed, sir, you would learn what hearings
</p>
<p>be. These land movements are nought. What
</p>
<p>would you say to thirty feet up and down three times
</p>
<p>a minute? with now your bows in the air and now
</p>
<p>your stern : pitched now forward now backward, now
</p>
<p>rolled from side to side ; thrust up to heaven till
</p>
<p>your brains are full of air, then sunk down till your
</p>
<p>belly squirms, inside out, outside in ! - <n
</p>
<p>SE- Maybe, sir : but the roof will not fall on
</p>
<p>your head : the waves do not crack your walls. Your
</p>
<p>ships being constructed mainly of wood . . .
</p>
<p>PRO. But the rocks, sir, are mainly constructed
</p>
<p>of stone, upon which if a wooden-constructed ship be
</p>
<p>driven, there's no man that would not pay his fortune
</p>
<p>down to set one foot on the most quakeful or boggy
</p>
<p>ground 'twixt Ganges and Gades. And there be
</p>
<p>monsters, too, which, though I have never seen them,

<p>you do your wine.

<p>1st Off. Steady, my men, steady !
</p>
<p>Mar. Ay, ay, sir.
</p>
<p>1st Off. Order ! To your seats !
</p>
<p>EP. Sit and drink, gentlemen. Wine shall be
</p>
<p>cheap to-day. The life in the earth will crack my jars.
</p>
<p>A few more rumbles like that will drain the cellars.
</p>
<p>15/ Off. (to t/ieu). We're safe here as anywhere,
</p>
<p>lads; if you keep an eye to the mainwalls. It's all
</p>
<p>plasterwork aloft.
</p>
<p>Enter CLITUS.
</p>
<p>CLI. Epicharis ! Art thou here, Epicharis ? ~ 5
</p>
<p>PRO. (to Epicharis). Who is this scared fellow ?
</p>
<p>CLI. Epicharis, 'tis come : the day is come !
</p>
<p>Fly from this place !
</p>
<p>EP. (to Proc. ). 'Tis my poor brother, sir : heed him
</p>
<p>not, he is simple.
</p>
<p>CLI. (come to Epi.). Seest thou not, 'tis the end,
</p>
<p>the day of wrath ?
</p>
<p>The earth shakes and the dead rise from their tombs.
</p>
<p>PRO. (to 1st Off). By Pluto, if he be not one of
</p>
<p>them !
</p>
<p>EP. (to Clit.). Sit down quietly, Clitus, for a
</p>
<p>minute : I can speak with you presently.
</p>
<p>CLI. O Madness ! Come from this hell : fly while
</p>
<p>thou mayst !
</p>
<p>Mar. Ay, sit, mate, sit ! be not afeard ! sit with us!
</p>
<p>CLI. Woe to you, slaves of Babylon ! woe cometh

<p>To the queen that sits upon the seven hills.

<p>Would make no part of Burrus. Why ! I am grieved

</p>
<p>Faithful, unblenched and certain of his path.

<p>All that philosophy has ever taught me
</p>
<p>He knew by instinct, and would hit the mark
</p>
<p>With careless action, where my reason fumbled
</p>
<p>And groped in the dusk. I say, if all the books
</p>
<p>I have ever read or writ, could make one man

<p>Like Burrus, with so natural a touch,

<p>And such godlike directness, none would doubt

<p>and the vote of the majority. I would not split the

<p>'Twas only Thrasea's opinion that overweighted him.

<p>I'll ask Scevinus first to state his plan.

<p>And stab him as he hurried to and fro.

<p>Half-burned, and what remains of it is prospectively
</p>
<p>Piso's.  Now, Subrius Flavus, what's your scheme?

<p>In face of all the people, a sacrifice

<p>SE- Why fix the time or place? Let all here

<p>swear
</p>
<p>That the first one of us who can approach him

<p>LUC. You bid us sacrifice our lives, but I
</p>
<p>Would gaze, like Cassius, on my glorious deed.
</p>
<p>PET. Then, Lucan, have you a plan?
</p>
<p>LUC. I should propose
</p>
<p>To leave the deed to Rufus : he commands
</p>
<p>The needful force.
</p>
<p>PET. Well, Rufus?
</p>
<p>RUF. 'Tis not easy,

<p>As Lucan thinks : and if he escape our swords,
</p>
<p>'Tis death to us all. There is but one way free
</p>
<p>Of personal risk.  If Piso would invite him
</p>
<p>To an entertainment at his house at Naples,
</p>
<p>We might be sure of him.

<p>Take you me for a Jew ? An entertainment !

<p>PIS. . Rufus, and all my friends,
</p>
<p>Hear me. While Nero lives, my life's in danger :

<p>Yet will I never move to take him off.

<p>If you shall choose to do it, or if he die,

<p>I'll be your Caesar : there's no more to say.

<p>SE- Lucan perhaps may know.

<p>And mentioned with my uncle, the physician.

<p>PIS. Who, now, is guilty of this?
</p>
<p>I have other evidence too that your secret
</p>
<p>Has been ill-kept, gentlemen. When I sent

<p>A messenger to Seneca this morning,

<p>He was refused admission.  Seneca knows.

<p>NOTES.
</p>
<p>NOTE I. ON ENCLITICS, ETC.
</p>
<p>In the fifth chapter of the Life of Johnson, the following story is given by B o swell : ' His schoolfellow and
</p>
<p>friend, Ur. Taylor, told me a pleasant anecdote of Johnson's triumphing over his pupil, David Garrick. When
</p>
<p>that great actor had played some little time at Goodman's Fields, Johnson and Taylor went to see him
</p>
<p>perform, and afterwards passed the evening at a tavern with him and old Giffard. Johnson, who was ever
</p>
<p>depreciating stage-players, after censuring some mistakes in emphasis, which Garrick had committed in the
</p>
<p>course of that night's acting, said, "The players, Sir, have got a kind of rant, with which they run on,
</p>
<p>without any regard either to accent or emphasis." Both Garrick and Giffard were offended at this sarcasm,
</p>
<p>and endeavoured to refute it ; upon which Johnson rejoined, " Well now, I'll give you something to speak,
</p>
<p>with which you are little acquainted, and then we shall see how just my observation is. That shall be the
</p>
<p>criterion. Let me hear you repeat the ninth commandment." Thou shall not bear false witness against thy
</p>
<p>neighbour. Both tried at it, said Dr. Taylor, and both mistook the emphasis, which should be upon not
</p>
<p>and false witness. Johnson put them right, and enjoyed his victory with glee.' Johnson was of course wrong,
</p>
<p>and Garrick right, at least if he accented the shalt in the usual way.
</p>
<p>A friend of mine once told me that when he was a boy at St. Paul's school it fell to his lot to recite the passage
</p>
<p>in Shakespeare's "Julius Czesar," xvhere Brutus and Cassius quarrel ; and in the following lines
</p>
<p>CASS. I am a soldier, I, ,
</p>
<p>Older in practice, abler than yourself
</p>
<p>To make conditions.
</p>
<p>BRU. Go to ; you are not, Casnius.
</p>
<p>CASS. I am.
</p>
<p>BRU. I say you are not.
</p>
<p>when he stressed them correctly, as here shown, he was censured and told to say Go to ; you are not, Cassius.
</p>
<p>Hmvever on the day of performance he lost his presence of mind, and did it right.
</p>
<p>These two illustrations of pedantry refusing to conform to idiom will explain the occasion of many of the
</p>
<p>accents, with which I have thought it necessary to disfigure my text ; for a good number of them will be found
</p>
<p>to be common enclitics. The rest are all put as guides to the dramatic rhythm, and many of them to ensure the
</p>
<p>usual pronunciation of words in verses the rhythm of which depends on it, but which I found some readers
</p>
<p>stumble at, so that they would rather mispronounce the word than accept the intended rhythm.
</p>
<p>To pass to another subject, there is a story told of a lady fallen into poor circumstances, who determined to
</p>
<p>support herself by the making and selling of mttffins : but when she got out into the streets with her basket, her
</p>
<p>heroism forsook her, so that she had not the courage to cry her wares. "Muffins, muffins," she said in an
</p>
<p>inaudible voice, and "I hope to heaven no one will hear me !" Now I have some hope that my readers will

</p>
<p>never credit me with such fiitility, but I have thought it belter that the advertisement of my books, which has
</p>
<p>hitherto always appeared on the wrapper of my plays, should be printed this time on a leaf of the book itself, so
</p>
<p>that it may be bound up with it, and serve me, with this statement, for an abiding evidence agaitist the writers
</p>
<p>for the press, who repeatedly assert that my published -works are witheld from the market. I feel that my
</p>
<p>recent mention of the ninth commandment is altogether unfortunate in their regard : but the collusion of my
</p>
<p>remarks was unforeseen.
</p>
<p>NOTE II. ON PALICIO.
</p>
<p>Since the publication of PALICIO, unexpected light has been thrown on the married history of Palicio and
</p>
<p>Margaret. It would seem that they had a son, who was probably named after his maternal uncle, the chief
</p>
<p>fusticiary: for in March 1891 a halfwitted Sicilian, named Manuel I'alizzi, or Palicio, was among the Italians
</p>
<p>who ivere executed by the mob in New Orleans, for being concerned in Ike murder of the head of the police.
</p>
<p>Though the mental condition of this unfortunate felhnv was such as to make his responsibility questionable, yet
</p>
<p>his connection with the Mafia society, and with their motives and crimes, points, as unmistakeably as his name,
</p>
<p>to his ancestor in my play, terribly degraded though he was in body as in mind. It is possible that some of our
</p>
<p>264 The fSecoJid Part of Nero.
</p>
<p>fanatical anarchists may be similarly the prey of a depraved atavism, and be impelled by a fermentation of the
</p>
<p>sour dregs of an old puritanic heroism. I hope that the family is now extinct. The late Professor Freeman in
</p>
<p>the introduction to his History of Sicily, contributed to the literature of my play, by giving a careful and full
</p>
<p>account of what I assumed to be the origin of the family name.
