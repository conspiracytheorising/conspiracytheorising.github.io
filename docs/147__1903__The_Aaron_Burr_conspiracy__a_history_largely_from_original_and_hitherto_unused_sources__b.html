<p>Preface
</p>
<p>FOR a century the conspiracy of Aaron Burr has
</p>
<p>been a puzzling theme. Apart from the distin
</p>
<p>guished figures that move across its stage, the
</p>
<p>nature of the enterprise from its very extravagance
</p>
<p>must always engage the attention of those who care
</p>
<p>to know something of the United States in its Heroic
</p>
<p>Age.
</p>
<p>The conspiracy was of much wider and deeper origin
</p>
<p>than has been usually supposed, and the conditions
</p>
<p>which gave rise to it, as well as the events with which
</p>
<p>it was vitally connected, have received scant treatment
</p>
<p>from historians. Social and political upheavals are not
</p>
<p>growths of a night, but are the results of the workings
</p>
<p>of real and definite causes which are traceable in every
</p>
<p>case and susceptible of some degree of analysis. Burr s
</p>
<p>project is no exception to this general law. And hap
</p>
<p>pily we are now far enough removed from his time to
</p>
<p>see more clearly the perspective of events, and to
</p>
<p>measure with more certainty the motives and conduct
</p>
<p>of men.
</p>
<p>In the discussion of the subject writers have in nearly
</p>
<p>every case failed to distinguish between the conspiracy
</p>
<p>and Aaron Burr in other words, they have attempted

<p>vii
</p>
<p>viii PREFACE
</p>
<p>to explain it through the character of Burr himself,
</p>
<p>a procedure which is fundamentally erroneous. Burr s
</p>
<p>character was apparently never more seriously involved,
</p>
<p>and never reflected more disastrously upon the con
</p>
<p>spiracy, than in the correspondence of Merry and Yrujo
</p>
<p>the ministers respectively of Great Britain and Spain
</p>
<p>to whom he ostensibly disclosed his designs. If the
</p>
<p>revelations of the ministers could be accepted at their
</p>
<p>face value, treason was in Burr s mind, and the separa
</p>
<p>tion of the West from the Union was his plot, open
</p>
<p>and avowed. However, viewing the correspondence
</p>
<p>as a whole, in conjunction with other facts which
</p>
<p>cannot here be discussed, it appears certain that Burr s
</p>
<p>intrigue with Merry and Yrujo was but a consummate
</p>
<p>piece of imposture. In order to secure funds for the
</p>
<p>carrying out of his expedition against Mexico, Burr
</p>
<p>resorted to the expedient of playing on the hatred of the
</p>
<p>European powers for the American Republic. Could
</p>
<p>they be brought to contribute moneys to aid in the
</p>
<p>sundering of the States? Burr thought so, and to
</p>
<p>secure the sum he conceived to be necessary for his
</p>
<p>purposes he never scrupled at discoursing of treasons,
</p>
<p>although at the moment every step he was taking
</p>
<p>looked toward an invasion of the Spanish territories.
</p>
<p>No weight can be placed upon Merry s and Yrujo s
</p>
<p>letters as concerns the nature of the conspiracy, except
</p>
<p>indeed in a negative sense ; and I say this with all defer
</p>
<p>ence to Mr. Henry Adams and those who have laid so

</p>
<p>much stress on these manuscripts, maintaining that they
</p>
<p>PREFACE ix
</p>
<p>lay bare the heart of the conspiracy. The heart of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy, however, was far removed from any com
</p>
<p>munication of Burr s. The conspiracy was an affection
</p>
<p>of society Burr was but a member of that society, an
</p>
<p>agent. It follows that if the nature of the conspiracy
</p>
<p>is to be disclosed, it can only be through an examination
</p>
<p>into the state of that society whose social, political, and
</p>
<p>traditional affiliations gave rise to it. This is basic.
</p>
<p>That the ideas of Burr, whatever they may have been,
</p>
<p>necessarily betray the secret of the movement, cannot
</p>
<p>be successfully maintained. But that the prevailing
</p>
<p>impression of Burr s character lent weight to the impu
</p>
<p>tation of treason cannot be doubted; nor more can it
</p>
<p>be doubted that the isolation of the West, together with
</p>
<p>the ignorance of the East concerning the pioneers
</p>
<p>who built their log cabins in the wilderness beyond the
</p>
<p>Alleghany Mountains, tended to distort extraordinarily
</p>
<p>the affair in the public mind. What were the ideas,
</p>
<p>then, prevailing in the Western country? Was there
</p>
<p>a contingent that plotted disunion ? Was there a party
</p>
<p>that clamored loudly for war against whatever power
</p>
<p>insulted the Republic? Of the first there is no trace
</p>
<p>worth considering; of the latter there is evidence in
</p>
<p>abundance. The spirit of the Westerners is proclaimed
</p>
<p>in no uncertain voice, and if its tone could have been
</p>
<p>mistaken in 1806, there was no doubting its meaning in
</p>
<p>1812, when, in spite of the opposition of New England,
</p>
<p>the Second War with Great Britain was forced.

</p>
<p>And yet this was done by the very men upon whom
</p>
<p>PREFACE
</p>
<p>Burr had counted, and the greatest leaders in that
</p>
<p>struggle had been his associates. If we look more
</p>
<p>closely we shall see, what has been but too timidly sug
</p>
<p>gested, that it was the West and South that took up the
</p>
<p>burden of the Republic when it had well nigh wearied
</p>
<p>of the load.
</p>
<p>As for the conspiracy, patriotism was but one of its
</p>
<p>elements. For him who reads the secret of the Anglo-
</p>
<p>Saxon character, there is epitomized in the movement
</p>
<p>the whole course of the race that threw down the bul
</p>
<p>warks of Rome, that terrorized Europe in a Viking s
</p>
<p>fleet, that conquered the Western World, and that looks
</p>
<p>confidently forward to the time when the struggle for
</p>
<p>universal supremacy shall test its powers. Expansion
</p>
<p>conquest was the keynote of the conspiracy ; it is
</p>
<p>the keynote of the history of the race.
</p>
<p>This narrative of the conspiracy of Aaron Burr has
</p>
<p>been in large part written from original and hitherto
</p>
<p>unused sources of information. It must not be thought,
</p>
<p>however, that the work of scholars in this field has
</p>
<p>been ignored ; on the contrary, I have made much use
</p>
<p>of it, but never intentionally without due credit
</p>
<p>either in text or notes. I have not found it expedient,
</p>
<p>however, to point out even the most glaring anachro
</p>
<p>nisms in many of the secondary narratives which treat
</p>
<p>of the conspiracy ; much less have I attempted to indi
</p>
<p>cate divergences of opinion and there are divergences
</p>
<p>as wide as misdemeanor is from treason.

</p>
<p>In the endeavor to make this study exhaustive much
</p>
<p>PREFACE xi
</p>
<p>time has been expended in searching for new data.
</p>
<p>Brief mention must therefore be made of the various
</p>
<p>sources which have been consulted, and of the materials
</p>
<p>exploited.
</p>
<p>In 1896 documents relating to the conspiracy were
</p>
<p>discovered in the Bexar Archives at San Antonio, the
</p>
<p>Spanish capital of the Province of Texas. From
</p>
<p>early in the eighteenth century, much of the correspond
</p>
<p>ence of the provincial Governors with the Captains-
</p>
<p>General and Viceroys of Mexico found lodgment in the
</p>
<p>musty files of the archives of the province. It is need
</p>
<p>less to say that they contain many manuscripts which
</p>
<p>are concerned with the westward growth of the
</p>
<p>United States and with the uninterrupted conflict which
</p>
<p>was waged with the retreating civilization of Spain. The
</p>
<p>views of the officers of Carlos IV. in that quarter as
</p>
<p>to the nature of the conspiracy are illuminating. They
</p>
<p>rightly classed it as a manifestation of the restless,
</p>
<p>encroaching activity of the nation which fate had
</p>
<p>placed on their borders.
</p>
<p>The archives of the State of Texas contain materials
</p>
<p>dating from the Spanish regime and are of value on
</p>
<p>more than one doubtful point.
</p>
<p>The Viceroyalty of Mexico on account of the promi
</p>
<p>nent position it held among the Spanish colonies became
</p>
<p>the great center for the accumulation of official corre
</p>
<p>spondence; and the treasure of manuscripts now con
</p>
<p>tained in the Archivo General de Mexico, Mexico City,

<p>is of inestimable value to the history of the New
</p>
<p>xii PREFACE
</p>
<p>World, and in an almost equal measure to that of
</p>
<p>Europe. Although we have ignored as far as possible
</p>
<p>the presence of the Spanish civilization in the affairs of
</p>
<p>America, and have remained blind to the tremendous
</p>
<p>formative and directive influence which it has exerted
</p>
<p>on the course of our national growth, it is from this
</p>
<p>collection that our own history is to be enriched and
</p>
<p>brought nearer to truth. The Departments of Marine,
</p>
<p>War, and the Provinces, together with the correspond
</p>
<p>ence which passed between the Viceroys of New Spain
</p>
<p>and the home Government deserve special mention. In
</p>
<p>the latter collection are letters from Viceroy Jose de
</p>
<p>Iturrigaray to Don Pedro Cevallos, then Minister of
</p>
<p>State, which go a long way toward explaining the con
</p>
<p>duct of General James Wilkinson at the crisis on the
</p>
<p>Sabine in November, 1806. The cloudy transactions
</p>
<p>which resulted in the lamentable Neutral Ground
</p>
<p>Treaty and in the over- vaunted defeat of Burr are
</p>
<p>somewhat cleared of the mist which has enshrouded
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>The Mississippi Valley also proved a fruitful field
</p>
<p>for research. New Orleans was the focus for the vari
</p>
<p>ous lines of forces which mingled in the conspiracy:
</p>
<p>it was the home of the Creoles who are supposed to
</p>
<p>have been at the heart of the plot; it was the place, if
</p>
<p>we follow generally accepted conclusions, specially de
</p>
<p>signed by the adventurers for plunder; and it had the
</p>
<p>unenviable distinction to be subjected for two months

<p>PREFACE ziii
</p>
<p>are files of the Moniteur de la Louisiane and of the
</p>
<p>Orleans Gazette, both of which newspapers were pub
</p>
<p>lished contemporaneously with the conspiracy. The
</p>
<p>former was the organ of the Creole population, the
</p>
<p>latter represented the Americans proper, while both
</p>
<p>contain, apart from valuable documentary evidence, a
</p>
<p>trustworthy reflection of the public mind of the time.
</p>
<p>It is needless to say that much new light is shed on
</p>
<p>that dark chapter in the history of the conspiracy which
</p>
<p>is concerned with the attitude of the native Louisianians
</p>
<p>toward Burr, and with Wilkinson s reign of terror in
</p>
<p>the capital of Orleans. The official manuscript Journal
</p>
<p>of W. C. C. Claiborne, the first Governor of the Terri
</p>
<p>tory, preserved in the old Tulane Law Library, is of
</p>
<p>exceeding interest, containing as it does much of his
</p>
<p>correspondence with the National Government, Wilkin
</p>
<p>son, and others.

<p>Colonel R. T. Durrett of Louisville has in his splen

</p>
<p>newspaper published at Frankfort, Kentucky, and
</p>
<p>edited by William Hunter. In it are voiced the early
</p>
<p>controversies that rent Kentucky society, which has
</p>
<p>always been regarded as rife with disaffection. Most
</p>
<p>of the sensational articles concerning Burr, Wilkinson,
</p>
<p>and the Spanish Association, which appeared in the
</p>
<p>Western World, an incendiary newspaper established
</p>
<p>at Frankfort in July, 1806, were reprinted in the

<p>xiv PREFACE
</p>
<p>portant source is the Lexington Gazette a file of which
</p>
<p>is preserved in the Lexington Public Library one of
</p>
<p>the most influential journals of the early West. Its
</p>
<p>columns, like those of the Palladium, were devoted to
</p>
<p>combating the inflammatory reports which appeared
</p>
<p>weekly in the Western World, and to asserting the
</p>
<p>patriotism of the frontiersmen.
</p>
<p>The letters cited from the Andrew Jackson MSS. are
</p>
<p>of moment, for the relations which subsisted between
</p>
<p>Jackson and Burr have been so distorted and amplified
</p>
<p>that any approximation to the truth is to be welcomed.
</p>
<p>I am obliged to Messrs. Woodbury and Gist Blair for
</p>
<p>transcripts of the original documents.
</p>
<p>The Henry Clay MSS. and the Breckenridge Letters
</p>
<p>were opened to my inspection, and it is a pleasure to
</p>
<p>express my gratitude to Thomas Clay, Esq., and to
</p>
<p>Colonel W. C. P. Breckenridge for their respective
</p>
<p>services in this connection.
</p>
<p>The Jefferson and Madison MSS. have been ex

<p>amined with profit. Moreover, the Department of
</p>
<p>State at Washington, contains a notable volume entitled
</p>
<p>&quot;Letters in Relation to Burr s Conspiracy/ the con
</p>
<p>tents of which, so far as I can ascertain, have never been
</p>
<p>made public. The letters are from various sources, and
</p>
<p>many of them are extremely significant, serving to
</p>
<p>make clearer the whole view of the conspiracy, espe
</p>
<p>cially the latter phase of it centering in the trial at
</p>
<p>Richmond.

<p>That Burr was himself a mapmaker is known, but
</p>
<p>PREFACE
</p>
<p>xv
</p>
<p>that maps exhibiting the geography of his Western
</p>
<p>enterprise were in existence had hardly been suspected.
</p>
<p>There are, however, three such maps in the possession
</p>
<p>of Mrs. Thomas C. Wordin. They were inherited from
</p>
<p>her grandfather, Dr. John Cummins, who lived on the
</p>
<p>Bayou Pierre in Mississippi Territory where Burr s
</p>
<p>expedition collapsed. Dr. Cummins indorsed for Burr
</p>
<p>to a considerable extent, which proved his attachment ;
</p>
<p>and no doubt when the conspirator was under trial
</p>
<p>in the Territory these tell-tale documents were turned
</p>
<p>over to one who could be trusted to secrete them. The
</p>
<p>maps are of preeminent significance, illustrating;, as
</p>
<p>they undoubtedly do, the outlines of Burr s project. To
</p>
<p>distinguish, Map No. i (measuring thirty-nine inches
</p>
<p>by thirty-two) shows the lower region of the Missis
</p>
<p>sippi River with Natchez, New Orleans, and the
</p>
<p>Washita lands, also New Mexico and Mexico .down to
</p>
<p>Yucatan. Map No. 2 is an admiralty chart ( twenty- three
</p>
<p>inches by nineteen) and gives with astonishing minute
</p>

<p>obtained only from Spanish sources; and this opinion
</p>
<p>is reenforced by the fact that the longitude in one case
</p>
<p>is reckoned from Cadiz. On the whole, these docu
</p>
<p>ments, the authenticity of which is indubitable, form a
</p>
<p>strong link in the chain of evidence.
</p>
<p>The correspondence of Anthony Merry, mentioned
</p>
<p>above, with whom Burr, while yet Vice-President,
</p>
<p>opened his intrigue, has been carefully examined. I had
</p>
<p>hoped also to find in the British Archives traces of
</p>
<p>Merry s correspondence with Burr in 1808, but my
</p>
<p>endeavors and the efforts of Mr. Hubert Hall of the
</p>
<p>Public Record Office were without result. Transcripts
</p>
<p>of Yrujo s correspondence with his home Government
</p>
<p>concerning Burr s disclosures to him have been de
</p>
<p>posited by Mr. Adams in the State Department
</p>
<p>Archives at Washington, and students ought to appre
</p>
<p>ciate such a display of good will and scholarly spirit.
</p>
<p>The reports of Merry and Yrujo reveal an astonish
</p>
<p>ing audacity of design on the part of the conspirators.
</p>
<p>While they failed in their main purpose of obtaining
</p>
<p>needed moneys from King George and Don Carlos,
</p>
<p>they succeeded in hoodwinking both Merry and Yrujo.
</p>
<p>Here, as indicated above, there arises between Mr.
</p>
<p>Adams and myself a diversity of opinion which only
</p>
<p>serves to illustrate what different conclusions may be
</p>
<p>drawn from the same materials, taken in conjunction
</p>
<p>with additional facts. In this connection it is a pleasure
</p>
<p>to say that, while I have often had cause to disagree

<p>The Aaron Burr
</p>
<p>Conspiracy
</p>
<p>CHAPTER I.
</p>
<p>A Brief Survey of the Period
</p>
<p>THE Conspiracy of Aaron Burr was preemi
</p>
<p>nently a revolutionary product, receiving its
</p>
<p>inspiration from that unprecedented period of
</p>
<p>upheaval which began with the Revolution of 1776, its
</p>
<p>impelling force from the character of the American
</p>
<p>pioneer, its license from the disturbed condition of
</p>
<p>affairs existing in the New World. It is therefore nec
</p>
<p>essary, in order correctly to view the movement, to
</p>
<p>devote a few words to a general survey of contempo
</p>
<p>raneous history, with especial regard to the West and
</p>
<p>the Spanish- American colonies.,
</p>
<p>America was in the Eighteenth Century, as now,
</p>
<p>inseparably bound up with Europe, the thought and
</p>
<p>feeling of the one instantly finding response in the
</p>
<p>other; so the flame of war for larger liberty, kindled
</p>
<p>first on the shores of America, was destined to lose
</p>
<p>itself in the vastness of the general conflagration. The
</p>
<p>doctrines set forth in the Declaration of Independence
</p>
<p>struck at the root of existing European institutions

</p>
<p>among which were privileged orders and denied the
</p>
<p>divine right of kings. The phrase that all men are
</p>
<p>created equal lent overwhelming impetus to the on
</p>
<p>coming French Revolution, and made possible the free
</p>
<p>dom of the wretched colonies of Spain in the Western
</p>
<p>World. The news of the rising in Europe thrilled the
</p>
<p>Thirteen Colonies which had been recently at war for
</p>
<p>their rights. The tricolor and the cockade became
</p>
<p>almost national emblems, while the mass of the people,
</p>
<p>whom the Constitution had sought in a measure to ex
</p>
<p>clude from power, came to feel their weight in the affairs
</p>
<p>of the nation. In the Spanish- American provinces, be
</p>
<p>cause of the strenuous measures resorted to by the au
</p>
<p>thorities, the force of the Revolution was much abated ;
</p>
<p>but in spite of the Holy Inquisition the seditious doc
</p>
<p>trines of the French enthusiasts were disseminated
</p>
<p>among the natives. 1 Presently there were some who,
</p>
<p>brooding over the condition of their country, began to
</p>
<p>direct stirring pamphlets against the iniquities of the
</p>
<p>Spanish Government, and to plot for its disruption. 2
</p>
<p>Summary and bloody were the proceedings of the au
</p>
<p>thorities against the conspirators, but nothing could
</p>
<p>stay the spread of the maxims of liberty and equality
</p>
<p>set in motion by the great Revolution, although at the
</p>
<p>moment its crimes appalled the world.
</p>
<p>If we examine into the internal conditions of the
</p>
<p>colonial establishments of Spain we shall see that
</p>
<p>everything was ripe for disunion and rebellion. A

<p>A BRIEF SURVEY OF THE PERIOD 3
</p>
<p>writer in Bell s Messenger, an influential journal of the
</p>
<p>day, said that the Spanish Colonies supported the
</p>
<p>parent as Anchises of old was supported by his chil-.
</p>
<p>dren; but that they had become tired of the weight
</p>
<p>and cared not how soon the burden was shuffled off.
</p>
<p>The condition of affairs in many parts was indeed
</p>
<p>deplorable, for the system of government which Spain
</p>
<p>bound upon her colonies was antiquated and ill ad-
</p>
<p>justgd^to the progress and necessities of the time.
</p>
<p>Everywhere absolutism, in Church and State, pressed
</p>
<p>the superstitious natives from one stage of degrada
</p>
<p>tion to a lower. Almost three centuries of Span
</p>
<p>ish rule in the Americas passed before the gross
</p>
<p>injustices in the prevailing order of things appealed to
</p>
<p>men with a force not to be repressed. Once more the
</p>
<p>masses were arrayed against privileged classes, and the
</p>
<p>fury of the Mexicans with their pikes at Guanajuato
</p>
<p>was not unlike that of the &quot;sans-culottes&quot; which over
</p>
<p>turned the Bastille and inspired the Terror.
</p>
<p>The United States, through social and commercial
</p>
<p>relations, knew of the insurrections in the Spanish
</p>
<p>Americas and watched the political situation with keen
</p>
<p>and lively interest. This was but natural, for senti-
</p>
<p>mentalism and revolutionary intoxication completely
</p>
<p>possessed the American mind. It was a radical regime
</p>
<p>that bore Thomas Jefferson in triumph. Aristocracy
</p>
<p>was spurned ; the oligarchy of our early national period
</p>
<p>was rudely cast off, while in its place was installed
</p>
<p>virile, confident democracy. The sympathy of the
</p>
<p>young Republic for the French people in their struggle

</p>
<p>against the tyranny of Europe was unquestioned; in-
</p>
<p>4 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>deed, tyranny in any quarter excited them to reprobate
</p>
<p>the existence of kings.
</p>
<p>It was in the West that this madness reached its
</p>
<p>height. The course of political events had told mightily
</p>
<p>in molding the character of the Westerners. Their
</p>
<p>nearest neighbors were the Spaniards in Louisiana, and
</p>
<p>these, through repressive laws and encroachments, had
</p>
<p>lost no opportunity to make life in the Mississippi
</p>
<p>Valley unendurable. The States lying to the east of
</p>
<p>the Alleghanies, the original Union, contributed much
</p>
<p>in a negative way to estrange the Western settlements
</p>
<p>by neglecting and ignoring their interests. When Spain
</p>
<p>confiscated property on the Mississippi the Westerners
</p>
<p>blazed with indignation; and yet Congress seriously
</p>
<p>considered a treaty which would have closed the Mis
</p>
<p>sissippi to their commerce for twenty-five years. Thus
</p>
<p>outraged, the pioneers expressed their feelings through
</p>
<p>outspoken petitions to the Assembly of Virginia and to
</p>
<p>Congress. Their rights, they declared, were considered
</p>
<p>but subsidies to be traded for commercial concessions
</p>
<p>to the East; they had no market for their corn and
</p>
<p>pork ; their goods were appropriated ; the Indians were
</p>
<p>sent against them: they would end the tyranny by
</p>
<p>expelling the enemy from Louisiana !
</p>
<p>There followed from 1787 a decade full of confu
</p>
<p>sion and intrigues. The most conspicuous movement
</p>
<p>was known as the Spanish Association, or Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>whose vital principle comprehended the incorporation
</p>
<p>of the West with the possessions of Spain. This, how
</p>
<p>ever, played an insignificant part in the course of

<p>events, for the people instinctively recoiled at the
</p>
<p>A BRIEF SURVEY OF THE PERIOD 5
</p>
<p>thought of becoming subject to a nation and a civiliza
</p>
<p>tion they loathed. In reality it has never been shown
</p>
<p>that the movement embraced more than a few politi
</p>
<p>cians and pensioners of Spain, of whom James Wilkin
</p>
<p>son was the chief, not only in point of service, but in
</p>
<p>talents. The Spanish movement can not have had,
</p>
<p>from the nature of things, roots that went deep in
</p>
<p>society the Westerners were bound to the States by
</p>
<p>unseverable ties of blood and tradition.
</p>
<p>When France rose against England and Spain,
</p>
<p>she had the sympathies of the Americans, who were
</p>
<p>even ready to take up arms in her behalf. Indeed,
</p>
<p>so tremendous was the force brought to bear on the
</p>
<p>Government that President Washington hardly with
</p>
<p>stood it ; even the devotion of the people to him seemed
</p>
<p>for a time irretrievably lost. At such a moment
</p>
<p>(1793) Genet, the French Minister, landed in America.
</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the tide of feeling he equipped
</p>
<p>privateers, harassed the Government and launched a
</p>
<p>project for the invasion of the Spanish Possessions
</p>
<p>from our Western States. Louisiana and the Floridas
</p>
<p>were to be taken and, perhaps, Mexico. 1 During the
</p>
<p>summer Genet pushed his Louisiana expedition, which
</p>
<p>was forming in the West under the leadership of
</p>
<p>George Rogers Clark. Upon receiving notice to the
</p>
<p>effect that two hundred and fifty men were actually
</p>
<p>collected in that quarter, Thomas Jefferson, then Secre
</p>
<p>tary of State, appealed to Governor Shelby of Ken
</p>
<p>tucky for information. The Governor admitted the

<p>presence of French revolutionists, and that Clark had
</p>
<p>received a commission to equip an army which had for
</p>
<p>its object the clearing of the Mississippi of the Span
</p>
<p>iards; but he said that he was powerless to interfere,
</p>
<p>inasmuch as every citizen had a right to leave the
</p>
<p>State, if he pleased, and to take with him arms and
</p>
<p>ammunition.
</p>
<p>This survey of events is necessary to us if we
</p>
<p>are rightly to interpret the Aaron Burr Conspiracy. It
</p>
<p>is only by studying the character of the people, the
</p>
<p>conditions under which -they lived, and the nature of
</p>
<p>their environment that we can comprehend their feel
</p>
<p>ings and their actions. But why should the West have
</p>
<p>been eager to wage a war against a neighboring power?
</p>
<p>Ostensibly it was a movement concerted with France
</p>
<p>against the enemies of humanity and liberty. There was
</p>
<p>still alive in the wilds of the New World something of
</p>
<p>the sentimentalism which had animated the best period
</p>
<p>of the great Revolution; and some of it, indeed, was
</p>
<p>destined to remain in the American breast to find its
</p>
<p>fruition in a struggle for the freedom of Cuba, which
</p>
<p>had felt for four centuries the leaden weight of medie
</p>
<p>valism. But sympathy for the oppressed is too often
</p>
<p>associated with indeed, too often conceals an in
</p>
<p>stinct which rises anew with every generation of
</p>
<p>Anglo-Saxons. In the mind of the Westerners, close-
</p>
<p>linked with their hatred of Spain for her insolence on
</p>
<p>the one hand and her oppression on the other, came
</p>
<p>the longing for her fabulous riches, which they meant
</p>
<p>sooner or later to take for themselves.

</p>
<p>When the patience of the trans-Alleghany settlers
</p>
<p>A BRIEF SURVEY OF THE PERIOD 7
</p>
<p>had been well-nigh outworn, Jay s Treaty, coupled
</p>
<p>with the victories of &quot;Mad Anthony&quot; Wayne over the
</p>
<p>Indians, brought relief to the Northwest, while the
</p>
<p>treaty which Pinckney negotiated at Madrid (1795)
</p>
<p>pacified the South and West. Spain at last recognized
</p>
<p>the claim of the United States to the free navigation of
</p>
<p>the Mississippi and granted under certain conditions
</p>
<p>the right of depositing goods in New Orleans. This
</p>
<p>dropping of the bars to commercial expansion proved
</p>
<p>a great stimulus to emigration; and by the end
</p>
<p>of the century the Westerners, numbering 400,000
</p>
<p>souls, were scattered along the Great Lakes, were
</p>
<p>gazing across the Mississippi, and were crowding the
</p>
<p>boundary lines of the Floridas. Indeed, no longer were
</p>
<p>boundaries sufficient to stay their progress many
</p>
<p>pushed into Missouri and Louisiana ; but for the present
</p>
<p>the goal toward which all eyes were turned was the
</p>
<p>possession of New Orleans and the Mississippi.
</p>
<p>&quot;At the beginning of the nineteenth century,&quot; says
</p>
<p>Roosevelt, 1 &quot;the settlers on the Western waters recognized
</p>
<p>in Spain their natural enemy, because she was the power
</p>
<p>which held the South and the west bank of the Missis
</p>
<p>sippi. They would have transferred their hostility to
</p>
<p>any other power which fell heir to her possessions, for
</p>
<p>these possessions they were bound one day to make
</p>
<p>their own.&quot;
</p>
<p>Such an opinion was shared in Europe. The French
</p>
<p>Ambassador, writing to his home Government from
</p>
<p>Madrid, said: 2

</p>
<p>8 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>&quot;The Cabinet of Madrid thinks it has the greatest in
</p>
<p>terests not to open the Mississippi to the Americans, and
</p>
<p>to disgust them from making establishments on that river,
</p>
<p>as they would not delay to possess themselves of the
</p>
<p>commerce of New Orleans and Mexico, whatever impedi
</p>
<p>ments should be opposed to their progress, and that they
</p>
<p>would become neighbors the more dangerous to Spain
</p>
<p>as, even in their present weakness, they conceive vast
</p>
<p>projects for the conquest of the western shore of the
</p>
<p>Mississippi.&quot;
</p>
<p>With the opening of the Nineteenth Century the
</p>
<p>grievances against Spain took a new form. Although
</p>
<p>the Mississippi had been thrown open to the commerce
</p>
<p>of the Americans they were forbidden to enter the
</p>
<p>Spanish domain on pain of arrest and imprisonment,
</p>
<p>or even death. The traders among the Indians were
</p>
<p>apprehended, their goods confiscated, and border
</p>
<p>troubles for example the Kemper brothers episode in
</p>
<p>West Florida assumed in several cases serious com
</p>
<p>plications. But the mine was laid on October 16, 1802,
</p>
<p>when Juan Ventura Morales, the Spanish Intendant of
</p>
<p>Louisiana, proclaimed that the right of depositing
</p>
<p>^oods in New Orleans had been forfeited by the Ameri
</p>
<p>cans. The whole country was aroused ; war for the vin
</p>
<p>dication of rights was everywhere proclaimed ; and it is
</p>
<p>not surprising that strong measures were contemplated
</p>

<p>commotion and, .at the nod of the Government, would
</p>
<p>have fallen on Baton Rouge and New Orleans, and
</p>
<p>punished the treachery of the perfidious Government.&quot; x
</p>
<p>In many quarters it was openly advocated that the
</p>
<p>West should appeal to arms. &quot;Coriolanus&quot; said in the
</p>
<p>Morning Chronicle, December 27, 1802 : &quot;Kentucky
</p>
<p>has the advantage of invasion; and she no doubt will
</p>
<p>use it, if unsupported by the Union; she moves alone
</p>
<p>to the combat; she is situated on the waters rapidly
</p>
<p>descending to the point of attack ; she will overwhelm
</p>
<p>Orleans and West Florida with promptitude and
</p>
<p>ease.&quot; 2
</p>
<p>Amidst this general clamor came the startling
</p>
<p>report of the transfer of Louisiana to Napoleon. The
</p>
<p>South joined the West in declaring that France should
</p>
<p>not be allowed to establish herself in her old possession.
</p>
<p>Nor was Jefferson so deaf as to mistake the ring of
</p>
<p>earnestness in the voice of his constituency his strong
</p>
<p>hold was in the South and West. He wrote in his
</p>
<p>message to Congress, October 17, 1803 : &quot;Previously,

</p>
<p>the danger to which our peace would be perpetually
</p>
<p>exposed, whilst so important a key to the command of
</p>
<p>the western country remained under foreign power.&quot;
</p>
<p>At the crisis, he said that if France persisted in her
</p>
<p>course to reoccupy Louisiana the United States would,
</p>
<p>of necessity, be forced to marry the army and navy of

<p>was unavoidable if Louisiana was not secured to the
</p>
<p>Union, so he sought to purchase the coveted land.
</p>
<p>In 1762 France ceded to Spain a region of unknown
</p>
<p>extent lying in the main to the west of the Mississippi ;
</p>
<p>this territory was known as Louisiana, having been
</p>
<p>named in honor of the great Louis. But now that
</p>
<p>France again led the nations and was dominated by
</p>
<p>such a man as Bonaparte the retrocession was sought,
</p>
<p>and on October i, 1800, with the secret treaty of San
</p>
<p>Ildefonso the act was concluded. Without entering into
</p>
<p>details, it is enough to state that the rupture of the
</p>
<p>Peace of Amiens, with its immediate consequences,
</p>
<p>caused Napoleon to meet the United States half way
</p>
<p>and Louisiana was sold.
</p>
<p>Hardly had the report of its acquisition become
</p>
<p>public when the question as to limits arose. Indeed,
</p>
<p>the United States commissioners, Monroe and Living
</p>
<p>ston, were engaged over this before the papers were
</p>
<p>signed. France held that the United States was en
</p>
<p>titled only to the land known as Louisiana, which was
</p>
<p>transferred to Spain in 1762 and which was retroceded to
</p>
<p>France by Spain in the Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1800.
</p>
<p>The United States was entitle*! to so much, but what
</p>
<p>were the boundaries? How far did Louisiana extend to
</p>
<p>the east? To the Iberville or to the Perdido? And
</p>
<p>was the western limit marked by the Arroyo Hondo,
</p>
<p>the Sabine, or the Rio Grande?
</p>
<p>The question of limits, however, did not at first
</p>
<p>disturb the, minds of the Westerners. The cession
</p>
<p>created great rejoicing throughout the region directly

<p>while governors thought it of enough importance to
</p>
<p>mention in their messages. Governor Greenup told in
</p>
<p>grandiloquent words what it meant for Kentucky and
</p>
<p>for the West, closing his remarks with a peroration on
</p>
<p>America as the home of freedom. 1 Quite different was
</p>
<p>the attitude of New England, where the purchase was
</p>
<p>held up to the grossest ridicule. To the men who
</p>
<p>opened the way for the march of empire it meant
</p>
<p>everything. No longer would their flatboats be levied
</p>
<p>upon by Spain for floating on the Father of Waters ; no
</p>
<p>longer would they be barred from the markets because
</p>
<p>of excessive duties; no longer would their material
</p>
<p>growth be hampered by a foreign power ; there were
</p>
<p>new regions to occupy, richer lands to develop and un
</p>
<p>bounded freedom of action! Now indeed the West
</p>
<p>erners rejoiced in the strong arm of the Government.
</p>
<p>They had more than they had dared to expect, and their
</p>
<p>enthusiasm for Jefferson and the national Government,
</p>
<p>to whom all was attributed, was unlimited.
</p>
<p>The acquisition of Louisiana settled finally the
</p>
<p>question of the navigation of the Mississippi; but the

<p>boundary dispute, complicated by the &quot;French Spolia

<p>dations on American commerce, promised no solution
</p>
<p>short of the sword. In the West, in truth, the sword
</p>
<p>was ready at any moment to leap from the scabbard.
</p>
<p>If the backwoodsman desired to move into new lands in

<p>search of game or to barter with the natives, he resented

<p>view to strike a blow at Spain. The primary purpose
</p>
<p>of any expedition was to corrupt his Majesty s allies, the
</p>
<p>Indians, or to study the geography for military pur
</p>
<p>poses. NemecioSalcedo, Captain-General of the Internal
</p>
<p>Provinces of Mexico, went to such an extreme that he
</p>
<p>complained to the Viceroy, in October, 1805, of the
</p>
<p>Lewis and Clark Expedition, saying that it went osten
</p>
<p>sibly to discover the source of the Missouri, but really
</p>
<p>I to estrange the Indians. 2 The Viceroy of Mexico sent
</p>
<p>reinforcements to the Sabine River to protect the fron
</p>
<p>tier, and agents among the natives of Texas. Presents
</p>
<p>were distributed among them, for, as the Spaniards
</p>
<p>wrote, Dr. Sibley, the Indian agent of the Americans,
</p>
<p>had tried to seduce them from their allegiance. Jeffer
</p>
<p>son, also in expectation of war, instructed Sibley to
</p>
<p>spare no means to convince the Red Men &quot;of the justice
</p>
<p>and liberality we are determined to use towards them,
</p>
<p>and to attach them to us indissolubly.&quot;
</p>
<p>Beside the bitter hatred of Spain there had sprung
</p>
<p>into vigorous life in the West a national consciousness,
</p>
<p>a national mind, which resented the insults of the
</p>
<p>powers and which was destined to preserve the Union
</p>
<p>in the second war with Great Britain. Indeed, in a
</p>
<p>sense, love for the Constitution meant detestation of

<p>Spain. The conflict with the wilderness and its inhabi

<p>Spanish institutions, civil and religious, and were filled
</p>
<p>with &quot;painful solicitude for the unfortunate millions

<p>^ added the sense of injustice done us in the Napo

<p>of Spain in America during^ the Nineteenth Century
</p>
<p>tended, in their view, to disprove the correctness of the

<p>belief. One of the reasons which brought Spain to

<p>hope that it would be made a buffer between the Ameri

<p>and restrained the United States from going to war

<p>Burr s Tour of the West
</p>
<p>*
</p>
<p>A THE time when he embarked in his conspir
</p>
<p>acy Aaron Burr was forty-nine years of age. He
</p>
<p>owned a distinguished ancestry; Jonathan
</p>
<p>Edwards, the foremost theologian of America, was
</p>
<p>his grandfather on his mother s side, while the Burrs
</p>
<p>were of noble German blood, Aaron s father being a
</p>
<p>noted divine and president of Princeton College. The
</p>
<p>misfortunes of Burr began early; his parents died,
</p>
<p>leaving him and an only sister at a tender age to the
</p>
<p>care of relatives. He was carefully prepared for col
</p>
<p>lege and at sixteen was graduated with distinction
</p>
<p>from Princeton. He was destined for the ministry, but
</p>
<p>a few months study of theology under Dr. Bellamy
</p>
<p>seems to have confirmed him in skepticism. He deter
</p>
<p>mined to take up the law,- and began its study under
</p>
<p>i Tappan Reeve, his brother-in-law. But the news of
</p>
<p>the battle of Lexington startled him from this for the
</p>
<p>time being. Hurrying to Boston Burr took his place
</p>
<p>in the ranks, and later joined Arnold s expedition to
</p>
<p>Quebec, nothing deterred by the perils of snow and ice
</p>
<p>and the pleadings of his relatives. He won distinction
</p>
<p>in the campaign and had the melancholy honor of bear
</p>
<p>ing away the dead body of General Montgomery from
</p>
<p>before the snowbound blockhouse whence recoiled the
</p>
<p>last serious assault on the capital of Canada. Burr s

</p>
<p>withal his knowledge of military science recommended
</p>
<p>him to his superiors. From an aide-de-camp to General
</p>
<p>Putnam he was soon elevated to the command of a
</p>
<p>regiment, acquitting himself notably while in charge of
</p>
<p>the Westchester lines above New York City.
</p>
<p>After four years of unremitting service, Burr re
</p>
<p>signed from the army and at once bent his energies
</p>
<p>to the law, and within a short space was admitted to
</p>
<p>practice. He opened an office in Albany and was soon
</p>
<p>after married to Theodosia Prevost, an attractive and
</p>
<p>intellectual widow. To them was born a daughter,
</p>
<p>Theodosia, who was to play a brilliant and tragic role.
</p>
<p>Burr resided at Albany until the British were with
</p>
<p>drawn from New York, when he moved thither and
</p>
<p>began the practice of his profession in earnest, mount
</p>
<p>ing rapidly in the esteem of the public and dividing
</p>
<p>honors with Alexander Hamilton.
</p>
<p>Burr s entry into politics seems to have been more
</p>
<p>by accident than design. In the beginning he steered
</p>
<p>clear of an alliance with either of the three great fami
</p>
<p>lies the Clintons, Livingstons, and Schuylers creat
</p>
<p>ing for himself an independent party, the nucleus of
</p>
<p>which was a group of enthusiastic young men whom
</p>
<p>Hamilton denominated Burr s myrmidons. As yet
</p>
<p>things went smoothly for Burr who was, in 1789, after
</p>
<p>having opposed the reelection of George Clinton to the
</p>
<p>governorship, appointed by him Attorney-General of
</p>
<p>the State. In this capacity he won recognition both as
</p>
<p>an orator and as an administrator, j Two years later, to

</p>
<p>Schuyler, Hamilton s father-in-law. This was the
</p>
<p>; beginning of the feud which closed with the dark,
</p>
<p>lamentable tragedy of Weehawken the duel in which
</p>
<p>Hamilton was slain.
</p>
<p>The career of Burr in the Senate, where he espoused
</p>
<p>the Republican cause, was eminently honorable. He at
</p>
<p>once strode toward the leadership of the party, and in
</p>
<p>the Presidential election of 1796 received thirty elec
</p>
<p>toral votes. At the end of his term of office, retired as
</p>
<p>Senator, he entered upon the maelstrom of New York
</p>
<p>politics. New York was in the election of 1800, as it
</p>
<p>has been so often since, the pivotal State, the determin
</p>
<p>ing factor in the national election. Through Burr s
</p>
<p>agency the Clintons and Livingstons were united, the
</p>
<p>schisms in the ranks of the opposition were widened,
</p>
<p>and the commonwealth was swept by the Republican
</p>
<p>electors. Burr was rightly credited with the victory,
</p>
<p>and was obviously the logical candidate for the Vice-
</p>
<p>Presidency, for which place he was nominated by the
</p>
<p>Congressional caucus which named Jefferson for the
</p>
<p>highest honor .v
</p>
<p>When the votes of the Electoral College were polled
</p>
<p>it was found that Jefferson and Burr had each seventy-
</p>
<p>three; John Adams sixty-five; Pinckney sixty- four;
</p>
<p>Jay one. There being a tie, the election was accord
</p>
<p>ingly thrown into the House of Representatives, where
</p>
<p>it resolved itself into a struggle between the Federal
</p>
<p>ists and the Republicans. After weary days of ballot
</p>
<p>ing and much bitterness Jefferson was made President,
</p>
<p>Burr becoming Vice-President. Now indeed storms

</p>
<p>began to gather. He came to be regarded by the Gin-

</p>
<p>tons and Livingstons as an interloper. The party once j
</p>
<p>victorious, he was discovered to be in the path of several
</p>
<p>aspiring gentlemen, who left no means untouched for
</p>
<p>his undoing. Attacked viciously by Cheetham, the
</p>
<p>scurrilous editor of the American Citizen, the organ of
</p>
<p>De Witt Clinton, he became also an object of suspicion
</p>
<p>and envy in the eyes of Jefferson and the Virginia
</p>
<p>political clique. Some of his assailants were only too
</p>
<p>glad to drag from the cesspool of political scandals any
</p>
<p>fragment which might be available in besmirching his
</p>
<p>character. He was accused of this and that, through all
</p>
<p>of which he maintained a resolute silence. It was a
</p>
<p>characteristic of his never to refute charges against his
</p>
<p>name. Losing caste with Jefferson and the leaders of
</p>
<p>his party, he stood for the governorship of New York;
</p>
<p>but he was doomed, and defeat led further to anni
</p>
<p>hilation of his hopes for political preferment.
</p>
<p>Alexander Hamilton, who had pursued him with
</p>
<p>relentless language and bitter, damaging charges, was
</p>
<p>challenged to a duel and slain as a direct outcome of the
</p>
<p>part he had played in the election. If anything was now

</p>
<p>successes. Driven from power in the States, he turned
</p>
<p>with enthusiasm to a plan he had early formed of revo
</p>
<p>lutionizing the Spanish colonies. 1 Indeed, before his
</p>
<p>term of office had expired, he was busy evolving ways
</p>
<p>and means which were to contribute to its success. As
</p>
<p>early as August 6, 1804, he had begun through an
</p>
<p>intermediary his intrigue with Anthony Merry, British
</p>
<p>Minister to the United States. 2
</p>
<p>A few days after the oath of office had been admin

<p>istered to his successor, George Clinton, Burr, still ani
</p>
<p>mated with the applause his last words in the Senate
</p>
<p>had occasioned, left Washington on a tour of the West
</p>
<p>a preliminary to the inauguration of his project. He
</p>
<p>reached Philadelphia March 21, 1805, where he planned
</p>
<p>to spend ten days before continuing his journey. There
</p>
<p>he met Merry, to whom he now laid open his deceptive
</p>
<p>project, which he hoped would wring from the British
</p>
<p>treasury a sum of money commensurate with his needs.
</p>
<p>Mr. Merry, in a cipher letter of March 29th, gave Lord

<p>BURR S TOUR OF THE WEST 21
</p>
<p>mentioned to me that the inhabitants of Louisiana seeml
</p>
<p>determined to render themselves independent of the
</p>
<p>United States and that the execution of their design is
</p>
<p>only delayed by the difficulty of obtaining previously an
</p>
<p>assurance of protection and assistance from some foreign
</p>
<p>power and of concerting and connecting their independ
</p>
<p>ence with that of the inhabitants of the Western parts
</p>
<p>of the United States, who must always have a command
</p>
<p>over them by the rivers which communicate with the
</p>
<p>Mississippi. It is clear that Mr. Burr (although he has
</p>
<p>not as yet confided to me the exact nature and extent of
</p>
<p>his plan) means to endeavor to be the instrument for
</p>
<p>effecting such a connection. He has told me that the
</p>
<p>inhabitants of Louisiana, notwithstanding that they are
</p>
<p>almost all of French or Spanish origin, as well as those
</p>
<p>of the Western part of the United States, would, for
</p>
<p>many obvious reasons, prefer having the protection and
</p>
<p>assistance of Great Britain to the support of France ; but
</p>
<p>that if his Majesty s government should not think proper
</p>
<p>to listen to his overture, application will be made to that
</p>
<p>of France, who will, he had reason to know, be eager to
</p>
<p>attend to it in the most effectual manner, observing that
</p>
<p>peace in Europe would accelerate me event in question
</p>
<p>by affording to the French more easy means of com
</p>
<p>munication with the continent of America, though, even
</p>
<p>while at war with England, they might always find those
</p>
<p>of sending the small force that would be required for
</p>
<p>the purpose in question. He pointed out the great com
</p>
<p>mercial advantage which his Majesty s dominions in
</p>
<p>general would derive from furnishing almost exclusively
</p>
<p>(as they might through Canada and New Orleans) the
</p>
<p>inhabitants of so extensive a territory.&quot;
</p>
<p>A masterly argument and impressively put. It was

</p>
<p>a luring bait, and Merry took it at once for what it
</p>
<p>seemed forwarding it to his Government with as
</p>
<p>much approbation as he dared and with as much expedi
</p>
<p>tion as he could command. If the commercial classes
</p>
<p>of England were determined to annihilate American
</p>
<p>22 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>trade, if King George was set upon insulting the
</p>
<p>young nation as part of his daily routine, the idea of
</p>
<p>dividing the house against itself seemed to Merry not
</p>
<p>only inviting, but most wise and diplomatic. And
</p>
<p>furthermore, should England reject the offer, France
</p>
<p>might seize the occasion to deal the commercial and
</p>
<p>political interests of her enemy a telling blow. The
</p>
<p>proposition was inviting. Thus far the ex-Vice-Presi-
</p>
<p>dent had dealt only in generalities he had discussed
</p>
<p>what was the common talk of the day concerning the
</p>
<p>infidelity of Louisiana and its determination to revolt.
</p>
<p>When pressed for something more tangible, Burr
</p>
<p>simply made excuses, giving out only as much as he
</p>
<p>. deemed necessary to secure &quot;the protection and assur
</p>
<p>ance required to accomplish the object.&quot; Merry con
</p>
<p>tinued :
</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Burr observed that it would be too dangerous
</p>
<p>and even premature to disclose to me at present the full
</p>
<p>extent and detail of the plan he had formed ; but that he
</p>
<p>was at the same time aware of the necessity of making
</p>
<p>the most ample and unreserved communication to his
</p>
<p>Majesty s government, in order that they might be fully
</p>
<p>satisfied, as well of the good faith with which he means
</p>
<p>to act, as of the practicability and utility to them of the
</p>
<p>undertaking which he had in view and that he would
</p>
<p>therefore send a confidential person to England to make
</p>
<p>those communications as soon as he should have received
</p>
<p>through me, the necessary assurance of their being
</p>
<p>disposed to grant the protection and assurance required
</p>
<p>to accomplish the object.&quot;

</p>
<p>to Merry which he knew had not the slightest chance
</p>
<p>of realization, did not appear at the moment, but could
</p>
<p>not have been more boldly proclaimed than in his
</p>
<p>statement of the &quot;protection and assurance required&quot; :
</p>
<p>&quot;In regard to the military aid, he said, two or three
</p>
<p>frigates and the same number of smaller vessels, to be
</p>
<p>stationed at the mouth of the Mississippi to prevent its
</p>
<p>being blockaded by such force as the United States
</p>
<p>could send, and to keep open the communications with
</p>
<p>the sea would be the whole that would be wanted; and
</p>
<p>in respect to money the loan of about one hundred thou
</p>
<p>sand pounds would, he conceived, be sufficient for the
</p>
<p>immediate purposes of the enterprise, although it was
</p>
<p>impossible for him to speak at present with accuracy as
</p>
<p>to this matter. On the latter allegation he observed that
</p>
<p>any suspicion of his Majesty s government being con
</p>
<p>cerned in the transaction, till after their independence
</p>
<p>should have been declared, which would arise if remit
</p>
<p>tances were made to this country or if bills were drawn
</p>
<p>from hence, might be avoided by the appropriation to this
</p>
<p>object of a proportion of the two hundred thousand
</p>
<p>pounds which the United States have to pay to his Maj
</p>
<p>esty next July, and part of which sum he would devise
</p>
<p>the means to get into his possession without its destina
</p>
<p>tion being either known or suspected.&quot;
</p>
<p>Already the matter of money was worrying Burr
</p>
<p>and his chief associates. This most necessary article
</p>
<p>in the inauguration of any project was their first con
</p>
<p>sideration, and, that it might be obtained, no device
</p>
<p>however questionable or nefarious was to be ignored
</p>
<p>if success were promised the end would justify the
</p>
<p>means. The matter of the two or three frigates at the
</p>
<p>mouth of the Mississippi was as nothing in the scales

<p>with a hundred thousand pounds, which were conceived
</p>
<p>24 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>to be sufficient for the &quot;immediate purposes of the
</p>
<p>enterprise.&quot;
</p>
<p>After the interview with Merry, Burr quickly made
</p>
<p>his preparations for his journey over the mountains to
</p>
<p>Pittsburg. He advised his daughter to address him for
</p>
<p>the time being at Cincinnati, in care of John Smith,
</p>
<p>Senator from Ohio, adding that the object of his
</p>
<p>journey, &quot;not mere curiosity or pour passer le temps,&quot;
</p>
<p>might take him to New Orleans and perhaps farther. It
</p>
<p>is quite probable that Burr planned a continuation of
</p>
<p>his voyage of discovery to Mexico. Certain it is that
</p>
<p>he alarmed Casa Yrujo the Spanish Minister who was
</p>
<p>proving such a plague to Jefferson before leaving
</p>
<p>Washington by sending twice to him for a passport to
</p>
<p>Mexico, &quot;under the pretext that the death of General
</p>
<p>Hamilton (whom he killed out of spite) would not
</p>
<p>permit his remaining in the United States.&quot; Yrujo
</p>
<p>knew of Burr s interviews with Merry, and therefore
</p>
<p>thought the object of Burr s visit most suspicious in
</p>
<p>a word, he believed him the spy of England. He
</p>
<p>reported that Burr had taken with him mathematical
</p>
<p>instruments for the purpose of making plans, and that
</p>
<p>the officials of the Floridas had been warned against
</p>
<p>his manoeuvres. 1 But Yrujo had not penetrated Burr s
</p>
<p>designs; little dreamed that his purpose was to place
</p>
<p>himself in touch with the revolutionists of Mexico, who
</p>
<p>were so shortly to smite the power of Spain.
</p>
<p>On April 29, 1805, Burr reached Pittsburg on the
</p>
<p>Ohio, where General James Wilkinson, who had just
</p>
<p>been appointed Governor of the newly organized Terri-

</p>
<p>tory of Louisiana, was to have joined him. But Wilkin
</p>
<p>son had been delayed ; so, leaving a letter for him, Burr
</p>
<p>embarked upon the Ohio in an ark which he had had
</p>
<p>specially prepared for him. In due time he reached
</p>
<p>Marietta, a hamlet of eighty houses, where he parted
</p>
<p>company with Mathew Lyon, member of Congress
</p>
<p>from Tennessee, whom he had overtaken en route and
</p>
<p>with whom it seems the matter of Burr s return to Con
</p>
<p>gress from that State was discussed. Putting off the
</p>
<p>next day he passed Parkersburg, and two miles below
</p>
<p>arrived at Blennerhassett s Island, which has become
</p>
<p>famous through its connection with the conspiracy. Its
</p>
<p>three hundred acres have been much reduced by the
</p>
<p>encroachment of the river, but the narrowing shores,
</p>
<p>where Harman Blennerhassett, an Irish gentleman,
</p>
<p>had planted fields of hemp and had erected palatial
</p>
<p>buildings, are still haunted with the memory of a
</p>
<p>tragedy. The master was absent, but Mrs. Blenner
</p>
<p>hassett invited the ex-Vice-President to dinner and
</p>
<p>this was the beginning of a connection which was to
</p>
<p>link forever the names of Burr and Blennerhassett.
</p>
<p>On the eleventh of May Burr reached Cincinnati,
</p>
<p>then a town of fifteen hundred inhabitants, where
</p>
<p>he became the guest of Senator John Smith, who was
</p>
<p>also a storekeeper and army contractor. There he
</p>
<p>met Jonathan Dayton, a friend from Revolutionary
</p>
<p>times, whose term as Senator from New Jersey had
</p>
<p>just expired. Burr spent a day in the company of
</p>
<p>Smith and Dayton, who were allied with him in the
</p>
<p>formulation of plans for the project. Hurrying down

<p>26 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>horse to Frankfort, which place was reached May 2Oth.
</p>
<p>Passing through Lexington, the 2Qth found him at
</p>
<p>Nashville, where he was four days the guest of Andrew
</p>
<p>Jackson and the recipient of unusual attentions. He
</p>
<p>was no longer the despised murderer of Hamilton, but
</p>
<p>the triumphant duelist; no longer the insidious, un
</p>
<p>scrupulous intriguer, but the general who had led the
</p>
<p>cohorts of Democracy to victory; and, finally, he was
</p>
<p>accepted as the predestined leader who was to scourge
</p>
<p>the Spaniards from America. This was, after all, the
</p>
<p>mission of his life. Such was Burr s announcement,
</p>
<p>and the news spread as fast as such welcome tidings
</p>
<p>might travel. To the Tennesseeans and the frontiers
</p>
<p>men in general it was a battle-call they were only too
</p>
<p>eager to answer; and among the first to respond was
</p>
<p>Andrew Jackson, major-general of the Tennessee
</p>
<p>militia.
</p>
<p>On June 3d Burr was provided by his host with an
</p>
<p>open boat, in which he floated to the mouth of the
</p>
<p>Cumberland River, a distance of two hundred and
</p>
<p>thirty miles, where his ark, which had come down the
</p>
<p>Ohio, was in waiting. The next stop was made sixteen
</p>
<p>miles down the Ohio at Fort Massac a prominent
</p>
<p>frontier post on the north bank of the river not many
</p>
<p>miles from its juncture with the Mississippi where
</p>
<p>General Wilkinson had arrived, having descended the
</p>
<p>river from Pittsburg in the wake of Burr. The General
</p>
<p>had halted also in Cincinnati, keeping company with
</p>
<p>Smith and Dayton, who were represented as busy with
</p>
<p>a scheme to dig a canal around the falls of the Ohio.

</p>
<p>He found time, however, to write to John Adair, an
</p>
<p>BURR S TOUR OF THE WEST 27
</p>
<p>influential Kentuckian soon to succeed John Brecken-
</p>
<p>ridge in the Senate: &quot;I was to have introduced my ,
</p>
<p>friend Burr to you ; but in this I failed by accident.
</p>
<p>He understands your merits, and reckons on you. Pre
</p>
<p>pare to visit me, and I will tell you all. We must have
</p>
<p>a peep at the unknown world beyond me.&quot; This letter
</p>
<p>perhaps affords a clue to the topic discussed by the
</p>
<p>General and his friends during the four days spent at
</p>
<p>Massac. No doubt the whole situation was canvassed :
</p>
<p>the probability of war with Spain ; the ease with which
</p>
<p>the Floridas might be overrun ; the matter of the equip
</p>
<p>ping of an army which should sail for Vera Cruz to
</p>
<p>light the torch of insurrection in Mexico. Wilkinson
</p>
<p>afterward averred that the subjects of their conferences
</p>
<p>were legitimate. Whatever they were, the two old
</p>
<p>army friends, who had stood side by side under the
</p>
<p>walls of Quebec, parted with high hopes, Wilkinson
</p>
<p>making his way slowly to St. Louis, while Burr set out
</p>
<p>in a barge fitted up by the general with sails and colors,
</p>
<p>and manned by ten soldiers and a sergeant. In his
</p>
<p>pocket was a letter to Daniel Clark, a prominent mer
</p>
<p>chant and influential citizen of New Orleans :
</p>
<p>&quot;This will be delivered to you by Colonel Burr,&quot;
</p>
<p>began the general s introductory note, 1 &quot;whose worth you
</p>
<p>know well how to estimate. If the persecutions of a
</p>
<p>great and honorable man, can give title to generous atten
</p>
<p>tions, he has claims to all your civilities, and all your
</p>
<p>services. You cannot oblige me more than by such con
</p>
<p>duct; and I pledge my life to you, it will not be misap
</p>
<p>plied. To him I refer you for many things improper to
</p>
<p>letter, and which he will not say to any other.&quot;

</p>
<p>28 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>While Burr, thus equipped, passed on toward New
</p>
<p>Orleans, Wilkinson approached Majors Bruff and Hunt
</p>
<p>of the garrison of St. Louis, Timothy Kibby, John
</p>
<p>McKee, and others with propositions varying from the
</p>
<p>conquest of Mexico to the establishment of a military
</p>
<p>empire in Louisiana as a consequence of anarchy in the
</p>
<p>Eastern States, growing out of the rule of Democracy.
</p>
<p>Wilkinson had already begun sowing the seeds which
</p>
<p>\\vere to prove the destruction of Burr. On June 24th
</p>
<p>instructions were written for Lieutenant Pike,, who
</p>
<p>went, according to Kibby and Adair, to explore the
</p>
<p>way to Santa Fe and the mines of Mexico.
</p>
<p>On June 25, 1805, Burr landed at New Orleans. The
</p>
<p>Orleans Gazette chronicled at the time : &quot;Colonel Aaron
</p>
<p>Burr, late Vice-President of the United States, arrived
</p>
<p>here on Wednesday last in a boat displaying the Ameri
</p>
<p>can ensign, and rowed by a detachment of soldiers.
</p>
<p>We understand he purposes returning to Kentucky in
</p>
<p>ten or twelve days.&quot; Burr was much pleased with the
</p>
<p>city, and wrote Theodosia that he should certainly
</p>
<p>settle there were it not for herself and her boy, who
</p>
<p>controlled his fate. New Orleans was a place of no
</p>
<p>mean importance; during the course of a year three
</p>
<p>hundred sea-going vessels and six thousand river flat-
</p>
<p>boats arrived at its levees, and nine thousand people
</p>
<p>busied themselves within its limits. The letter to Clark
</p>
<p>was presented, and at an early date he gave a dinner
</p>
<p>in Burr s honor, which was attended by the best element
</p>
<p>in the city. Other fetes followed, and Burr was every

</p>
<p>where received with the utmost cordiality.
</p>
<p>BURR S TOUR OF THE WEST 29
</p>
<p>The society most frequented by Burr has been, and
</p>
<p>in all probability will remain, a source of dispute. 1
</p>
<p>There is no conclusive evidence to show that Burr re
</p>
<p>stricted his confidences while in New Orleans to any
</p>
<p>individual or group of individuals. It appears from
</p>
<p>the light we have that Burr s purpose was to observe
</p>
<p>the drift of public opinion; to engage the warlike and
</p>
<p>the adventurous in his filibustering enterprise against i
</p>
<p>the Spanish possessions. In this he was most success
</p>
<p>ful; the Mexican Association, formed for the avowed
</p>
<p>purpose of collectingf &quot;Mexican data which would be
</p>
<p>useful for the United States in case of war with
</p>
<p>Spain, was enlisted in his cause. Two of the most
</p>
<p>influential members of the Association were John Wat-
</p>
<p>kins, Mayor of New Orleans, and James Workman,
</p>
<p>judge of the county court. The former related to
</p>
<p>W. C. C. Claiborne, Governor of the Territory of
</p>
<p>J Henry Adams says that Burr was &quot;entertained by the
</p>
<p>enemies of Governor Claiborne and of the Spaniards&quot; (History
</p>
<p>of the United States, iii., 223) ; that Wilkinson told the story, on
</p>
<p>the evidence of Lieutenant Spence, that &quot;Burr on his arrival in
</p>
<p>Louisiana became acquainted with the so-called Mexican Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation a body of some three hundred men, leagued together j
</p>
<p>for the emancipation of Mexico from the Spanish rule, . . .
</p>
<p>and under his influence the scheme of disunion was made a part
</p>
<p>of the Mexican plan.&quot; A moment later we are assured by the
</p>
<p>same eminent authority that Burr did not conceal his secrets
</p>
<p>from his &quot;principal allies the Creoles of New Orleans &quot; (iii.,
</p>
<p>227). In other words, Mr. Adams contends for the Mexican
</p>
<p>Association was composed of Americans that practically the
</p>
<p>whole city, rent with factions, was in the secret which embraced
</p>

<p>should be devoted to the overthrowing of the Spanish

</p>
<p>Clark probably knew as much as any one of what
</p>
<p>was in contemplation, and his attitude of friendliness
</p>
<p>toward Burr at a later period, when he had every
</p>
<p>motive to pursue a different course, with his outspoken
</p>
<p>condemnation of Wilkinson in his Proofs* shows
</p>
<p>that one of his attributes was love of justice. Gayarre
</p>
<p>more than established the correctness of the Proofs,
</p>
<p>which exposed Wilkinson s corrupt dealings with the
</p>
<p>Spaniards ; and if Clark never fully divulged his knowl
</p>
<p>edge of Burr s project, he betrayed the secret of it when
</p>
<p>he declared on the floor of Congress, at the moment
</p>
<p>when expectation was at its highest tension, that if
</p>
<p>treason were contemplated no Louisianian would be
</p>
<p>found concerned in it ! Clark himself entertained revo
</p>
<p>lutionary ideas, but they did not involve the sundering
</p>
<p>of the States. John Graham, Secretary of the Territory
</p>
<p>of Orleans, said that Clark had given him some papers
</p>
<p>which told, among other things, of the strength of the
</p>
<p>Mexican forces and garrisoned towns between Vera
</p>
<p>Cruz and the City of Mexico, and of the naval strength
</p>
<p>of Vera Cruz. It was Clark s opinion that Mexico
</p>
<p>could be easily invaded, but he would have nothing to
</p>
<p>do with such an undertaking if headed by the Govern
</p>
<p>ment. Permission was all that was wanted an empire i.

<p>could then be established. 2 This information had been

<p>acquired while on trading voyages to the chief seaport
</p>
<p>of Mexico. Of these voyages there are frequent ac
</p>
<p>counts in the Spanish official reports, 1 for Clark was
</p>
<p>wont to recite to Government the news of Europe and
</p>
<p>America. But an end came to this when the Spaniards
</p>
<p>learned that he had been chosen a Delegate to Congress. 2
</p>
<p>Burr no doubt profited by what Clark had learned of the
</p>
<p>conditions of society in Mexico, and the merchant was
</p>
<p>^observer enough to note that a revolution was imminent.
</p>
<p>That he agreed to join with Burr there is little doubt ;
</p>
<p>but he, like many others, wished to see the movement
</p>
<p>triumphant before sharing its fortunes. Certain it is
</p>
<p>Clark never set out to play a heavy part in the plot,
</p>
<p>which, as he understood it, was wholly against Mexico.
</p>
<p>It was a matter for jest with him when he heard on
</p>
<p>the streets of New Orleans the extravagant designs
</p>
<p>attributed to his new acquaintance, whose address even
</p>
<p>was unknown to him. September 7th, a few weeks
</p>
<p>after the departure of Burr from New Orleans and
</p>
<p>almost at the hour of his arrival in St. Louis on his
</p>
<p>visit to Wilkinson, Clark wrote to the General : s
</p>
<p>&quot;Many absurd and wild reports are circulated here,
</p>
<p>and have reached the ears of the officers of the late

<p>them that he is much their friend. . . . What in the
</p>
<p>name of Heaven could give rise to these extravagances?
</p>
<p>Were I sufficiently intimate with Mr. Burr, and knew
</p>
<p>where to direct a line to him, I should take the liberty of
</p>
<p>writing to him. . . . The tale is a horrid one, if well
</p>
<p>told. Kentucky, Tennessee, the State of Ohio, with part
</p>
<p>of Georgia and part of Carolina, are to be bribed with
</p>
<p>the plunder of the Spanish countries west of us to sepa
</p>
<p>rate from the Union; this is but a part of the business.
</p>
<p>Heaven, what wonderful doings there will be in those
</p>
<p>days ! . . . Amuse Mr. Burr with an account of it.&quot;
</p>
<p>Burr was pleased with the aspect of affairs in
</p>
<p>Louisiana and wrote his daughter that he had promised
</p>
<p>to return the next fall. Having spent a fortnight in
</p>
<p>New Orleans, where he had attached to his interests the
</p>
<p>Mexican Association, the adventurers, and the revolu-
</p>
<p>tiofcary element, Burr, mounted on horses provided by
</p>
<p>Clark, set out on his return overland. His first stop
</p>
<p>was at Natchez, where a week was spent among those
</p>
<p>who were eager to engage in a war with Spain,
</p>
<p>to punish the so-called invaders of the country. From
</p>
<p>Natchez he proceeded to Nashville, hazarding four
</p>
<p>hundred and fifty miles of wilderness. On August 6th
</p>
<p>he was again domiciled with Jackson, who was, as
</p>
<p>Burr described him at the time, a man of intelligence
</p>
<p>and a prompt, frank, ardent soul. A public dinner
</p>
<p>was now spread in Burr s honor at the capital, where
</p>
<p>toasts were drunk of a nature to leave no doubt as
</p>
<p>to the sympathies of the audience. Then he passed
</p>
<p>to Lexington, where he was the recipient of hospi
</p>
<p>talities such as only Southerners of that day knew
</p>
<p>how to dispense. The last day of August Burr was

</p>
<p>fort, where he was once more quartered with John
</p>
<p>Brown, a distinguished citizen who had for years been
</p>
<p>a prominent figure in Kentucky politics. On September
</p>
<p>2d Burr was in Louisville; ten days later he reached
</p>
<p>St. Louis on a visit to General Wilkinson, who had
</p>
<p>already assumed the reins as governor. Burr now
</p>
<p>learned that Pike was exploring the best route to Santa
</p>
<p>Fe; and Wilkinson heard what was not news to him,
</p>
<p>that the West and South were eager for a fight with
</p>
<p>Spain, that an army could be raised in a few days for
</p>
<p>the conquest of Mexico. To all appearances there was
</p>
<p>, no break in their friendship, nor any abatement of
</p>
<p>- enthusiasm. In truth it could have been no object of
</p>
<p>minor importance which called Burr at that season so
</p>
<p>far out of his way. Wilkinson attempted to depreciate
</p>
<p>this visit by repeating under oath at the trial at Rich
</p>
<p>mond the following conversation: 1
</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Burr speaking of the imbecility of the Govern
</p>
<p>ment said it would molder to pieces, die a natural death,
</p>
<p>or words to that effect, adding that the people of the
</p>
<p>Western country were ready to revolt. To this I recollect
</p>
<p>replying that, if he had not profited more by his journey
</p>
<p>in other respects, he had better have remained at Wash
</p>
<p>ington or Philadelphia; for surely, said I, my friend, no
</p>
<p>person was ever more mistaken ! The Western people
</p>
<p>disaffected to the Government! They are bigoted to
</p>
<p>Jefferson and democracy.&quot;
</p>
<p>What was equally to the point, the General claimed
</p>
<p>to have written, upon the departure of the ex-Vice-
</p>
<p>President, a letter denouncing him to the Secretary of
</p>
<p>the Navy ; Wilkinson thought its text about as follows :

</p>
<p>&quot;Burr is about something, but whether internal or ex-
</p>
<p>ternal I cannot discover. I think you should keep an
</p>
<p>eye on him.&quot;
</p>
<p>In spite of the paucity of the testimony, ffildre-th- 1
</p>
<p>and others have tacitly credited Wilkinson with having,
</p>
<p>at so early a date, given notice of the approaching dan
</p>
<p>ger. There are, however, no available data to show that
</p>
<p>his interest in the career of Burr had flagged, for we
</p>
<p>find him carefully fostering the deception that Burr
</p>
<p>sought to be returned to Congress. When Burr left
</p>
<p>St. Louis for Vincennes, capital of Indiana Territory,
</p>
<p>which place he reached September 23d, he carried with
</p>
<p>him this letter from Wilkinson to Governor William
</p>
<p>Henry Harrison :
</p>
<p>&quot;I will demand from your friendship a boon in its /
</p>
<p>influence co-extensive with the Union; a boon, perhaps,
</p>
<p>on which the Union may much depend ; a boon which
</p>
<p>may serve me, may serve you, and disserve neither. . . .
</p>
<p>-If you ask, What is this important boon which I so
</p>
<p>earnestly crave? I will say to you, return the bearer to
</p>
<p>the councils of our country, where his talents and abilities
</p>
<p>are all-important at the present moment.&quot;
</p>
<p>From Vincennes, at the time he set out for Wash
</p>
<p>ington, Burr wrote Wilkinson that the matter of which
</p>
<p>he had written had not been mentioned in his conversa
</p>
<p>tion. But whether the General had or had not discoun
</p>
<p>tenanced Burr s projects, there were not wanting those -j
</p>
<p>who looked askance at his Western meanderings. Be

</p>
<p>papers attributed to him as many plots as the ingenuity
</p>
<p>of the sensation-monger could conjure up.
</p>
<p>&quot;We have been frequently asked,&quot; explained the editor
</p>
<p>of the Lexington Gazette, &quot;why we have paid such atten
</p>
<p>tion to the movements of Mr. Burr since his arrival in
</p>
<p>the Western country. The latter part of his political
</p>
<p>\ career, fraught, perhaps, with a degree of duplicity which
</p>
<p>&quot;* . ! can never be satisfactorily defended, has made him an
</p>
<p>object of attention wherever he has traveled. His talents
</p>
<p>for intrigue are considered as unrivalled in America, and
</p>
<p>his disposition doubted by few. The subsequent queries
</p>
<p>have lately appeared in the Gazette of the United States.
</p>
<p>Whether any circumstances have come to the knowledge
</p>
<p>of the writer which would justify such a publication, we
</p>
<p>are uninformed. Without giving an opinion as to his
</p>
<p>views in this country, we publish the queries, ... at
</p>
<p>the same time believing that if he calculated on with
</p>
<p>drawing the affections of the people of the Western
</p>
<p>States from their Government, he will find himself
</p>
<p>deceived, if he has not already made the discovery.&quot; *
</p>
<p>Here are the queries alluded to :
</p>
<p>&quot;How long will it be before we shall hear of Colonel
</p>
<p>Burr being at the head of a revolutionary party on the
</p>
<p>Western waters? Is it a fact that Colonel Burr has
</p>
<p>formed a plan to engage the adventurous and enterprising
</p>
<p>young men from the Atlantic States to Louisiana ? Is it
</p>
<p>one of the inducements that an immediate convention
</p>
<p>will be called from the States bordering on the Ohio and
</p>
<p>Mississippi to form a separate government ? Is it another
</p>
<p>that all the public lands are to be seized and partitioned
</p>
<p>among these States, except what is reserved for the war
</p>
<p>like friends and followers of Burr in the revolution? Is
</p>
<p>it part of the plan for the new States to grant the new

</p>
<p>the military posts at New Orleans and on the Mississippi
</p>
<p>be in the hands of Colonel Burr s revolutionary party?
</p>
<p>How soon will Colonel Burr engage in the reduction of
</p>
<p>Mexico by granting liberty to its inhabitants, and seizing
</p>
<p>on its treasures, aided by British ships and forces ? What
</p>
<p>difficulty can there be in completing a revolution in one
</p>
<p>summer, among the Western States , when they will gain
</p>
<p>the Congress lands, will throw off the public debt, will
</p>
<p>seize their own revenues, and enjoy the plunder of
</p>
<p>Spain?&quot;
</p>
<p>To say the least, this was a remarkable set of inter
</p>
<p>rogations; and what was equally remarkable was the
</p>
<p>avidity with which it was seized on by the press and
</p>
<p>circulated with added comment from border to border
</p>
<p>of the country. It was a sensational story, and whether
</p>
<p>it were the product of some quill-driver of a partisan
</p>
<p>sheet, or the naked fact, the readers of the &quot;yellow&quot;
</p>
<p>journals of that day had no means of ascertaining.
</p>
<p>They rarely questioned ; in the absence of the telegraph
</p>
<p>it was no easy task to verify a report, and such writers
</p>
<p>as John Wood and Duane, Cheetham and Callender
</p>
<p>never pothered over uncertainties. In the West at this
</p>
<p>time the papers were a unit in denouncing the unfair
</p>
<p>and altogether slanderous insinuations that the fron
</p>
<p>tiersmen were eager for lawless measures. But in spite
</p>
<p>of expressions of affection for the Constitution and
</p>
<p>for the Union, the impression spread abroad that the *f
</p>
<p>West was once more on the verge of slipping under
</p>
<p>the Spanish yoke; or, indeed, of enlisting under the
</p>
<p>banner of an adventurer. In this way the country was
</p>
<p>gradually prepared for the events of the ensuing year.
</p>
<p>Nor were these whispers of suspicion to be stayed by

</p>
<p>July a month before Clark reported the rumors from
</p>
<p>New Orleans, weeks before the newspapers took up the
</p>
<p>alarm the news had reached our warlike neighbors
</p>
<p>in Texas that Aaron Burr, ex-Vice-President, had come
</p>
<p>to New Orleans under military escort, and that it was
</p>
<p>reported he meditated some extraordinary enterprise,
</p>
<p>the exact nature of which was still in doubt. 1 Like
</p>
<p>wise the stirring news spread eastward. On August 4th,
</p>
<p>while Burr was emerging from the wilderness to the
</p>
<p>south of Nashville, Merry hastened to communicate to
</p>
<p>Lord Mulgrave that the scheme had been betrayed or
</p>
<p>had been ruined through publicity :
</p>
<p>&quot;Notwithstanding that the confidential person, whom,
</p>
<p>as I had the honor to mention to your lordship in my
</p>
<p>despatch No. 22 [March 29th] Mr. Burr had said that
</p>
<p>he intended to send to me, has not as yet appeared, I learn
</p>
<p>that that gentleman has commenced his plan in the West
</p>
<p>ern country, and apparently with much success, although
</p>
<p>it would seem, that he or some of his agents have either
</p>
<p>been indiscreet in their communications, or have been
</p>
<p>betrayed by some person, in whom they considered that
</p>
<p>they had reason to confide, for the object of his journey
</p>
<p>has now begun to be noticed in the public prints, where
</p>
<p>it is said that a convention is to be called immediately
</p>
<p>from the States bordering on the Ohio and Mississippi
</p>
<p>for the purpose of forming a separate government. It
</p>
<p>is, however, possible that the business may be so far
</p>
<p>advanced as, from the nature of it, to render any further
</p>
<p>secrecy impossible. The best accounts of Mr. Burr were
</p>
<p>from St. Louis, from whence he had proceeded to New
</p>
<p>Orleans, and it is observed that he had been received
</p>
<p>everywhere with the most marked attention.&quot; ;

</p>
<p>report to the Foreign Office of Burr s project ; months
</p>
<p>had passed since the notable letter of March 2Qth had
</p>
<p>been dispatched and yet the home Government was
</p>
<p>silent. The Minister should have taken the hint. But -
</p>
<p>far from that, his enthusiasm was unbounded when he
</p>
<p>learned through current rumor that the undertaking
</p>
<p>was actually begun. Here was a triumph to boast of,
</p>
<p>for had he not rendered an early account of it to the
</p>
<p>Foreign Office? This time, however, his information
</p>
<p>had come through the medium of the press, and Yrujo
</p>
<p>read the same paragraphs and inclosed them to
</p>
<p>Cevallos, the Spanish Minister of State, with a letter
</p>
<p>dated August 5th, one day after Merry had penned
</p>
<p>his account. Referring to Burr s secret interviews
</p>
<p>with the English Minister, his demand for a passport
</p>
<p>to Mexico, the draughting instruments, he registered r
</p>
<p>again his suspicions, adding, however, that the West
</p>
<p>at the moment was unripe for Burr s designs, and
</p>
<p>scoffing at the idea of an attack on Mexico. In con
</p>
<p>clusion, Yrujo showed in a paragraph that he had al
</p>
<p>most fathomed the business of Burr :
</p>
<p>&quot;The supposed expedition against Mexico is ridic
</p>
<p>ulous and chimerical in the present state of things ; but I
</p>
<p>am not unaware that Burr, in order to get moneys from
</p>
<p>the English Minister or from England, has made to him

</p>
<p>*
</p>
<p>WHEN Aaron Burr had returned to Washing
</p>
<p>ton from his summer in the West, he was
</p>
<p>fully satisfied that his project could fail only
</p>
<p>for want of the &quot;sinews of war.&quot; Everywhere through
</p>
<p>the Western country he had been applauded as the
</p>
<p>leader who was to march an army to the heart of the
</p>
<p>Kingdom of Mexico, giving freedom to her enslaved
</p>
<p>millions, and, incidentally, fortunes to his followers.
</p>
<p>The Westerners excitable, sympathetic, liberty-lov
</p>
<p>ing, and patriotic longed for an opportunity to reta
</p>
<p>liate against Spain for insults of long standing, and
</p>
<p>they were ready to accept the smallest provocation as
</p>
<p>excuse for an assault on her decaying empire. Burr
</p>
<p>gave them to understand that a war with their old
</p>
<p>oppressor was only a matter of time ; that the Govern
</p>
<p>ment would not interfere with his plans ; while to some
</p>
<p>he said that an expedition for the invasion of the Span
</p>
<p>ish territories would be formed regardless of cause or
</p>
<p>consequence. It was against this emergency that he
</p>
<p>needed half a million dollars; and in the pursuit of
</p>
<p>which he invoked all his powers of dissimulation con

</p>
<p>light thrown upon the movement to distort and con

<p>42 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>Burr s first interview with Merry upon returning to
</p>
<p>Washington from the West was a masterpiece of in
</p>
<p>trigue. Merry scrupulously reported the whole of
</p>
<p>Burr s story to Lord Mulgrave. 1 Burr opened with the
</p>
<p>remark that he thought the English Government dis
</p>
<p>posed
</p>
<p>&quot;to afford him their assistance, but he observed that the
</p>
<p>information which had reached him on this head was
</p>
<p>not sufficiently explicit to authorize him to send a con
</p>
<p>fidential person to London to make to them the necessary
</p>
<p>communication as he had promised and intended. He
</p>
<p>was therefore now obliged to try the effect of those which
</p>
<p>I might be able to convey. . . . These disappoint
</p>
<p>ments gave him, he said, the deepest concern, because his
</p>
<p>journey through the Western country and Louisiana as
</p>
<p>far as New Orleans, as well as through a part of West
</p>
<p>Florida, had been attended with so much more success
</p>
<p>than he had even looked for, that everything was in fact
</p>
<p>completely prepared in every quarter for the execution
</p>
<p>of his plan ; and because he had therefore been induced
</p>
<p>to enter into an engagement with his associates and
</p>
<p>friends to return to them in the month of March next,
</p>
<p>in order to commence the operations.&quot;
</p>
<p>That Merry who had more than three months
</p>
<p>earlier reported to Lord Mulgrave the successful com
</p>
<p>mencement of the Western enterprise ; who had seen in
</p>
<p>the newspapers at least a dozen projects attributed to
</p>
<p>the ex-Vice-President should have asked no questions,
</p>
<p>but have put in an official dispatch with his indorsement
</p>
<p>the whole of Burr s story, is more a compliment to
</p>
<p>his industry and ambition than to his sagacity or intelli
</p>
<p>gence. Burr s fear of delay in receiving the pecuniary

</p>
<p>assistance led him to say to Merry that the inaugura-
</p>
<p>tion of his plan was set for March, while in reality so -,
</p>
<p>early a date was never contemplated. Because of the
</p>
<p>shortness of the time and the winter season it was
</p>
<p>wholly out of the question. It was announced in the
</p>
<p>West for the ensuing fall ; and the correspondence and
</p>
<p>every step taken by the conspirators show that to have
</p>
<p>been the earliest time considered. Burr s next point *^
</p>
<p>of deception was that he had received encouraging
</p>
<p>communications which gave him &quot;room to hope and
</p>
<p>expect that his Majesty s government were disposed to
</p>
<p>afford him their assistance.&quot; But the truth was that
</p>
<p>neither Colonel Williamson nor any other agent of
</p>
<p>Burr had appeared or seems likely ever to have ap
</p>
<p>peared before the English Cabinet. The fact that
</p>
<p>Merry never received a line on the subject of the nego
</p>
<p>tiation from the Foreign Office is proof conclusive that
</p>
<p>the Government never gave an outsider encouragement.
</p>
<p>To have Merry believe the contrary, however, was but
</p>
<p>a skillful device used by Burr to secure his approba
</p>
<p>tion of the plan; for clearly it would have been dis
</p>
<p>astrous for an arrangement to be made through any
</p>
<p>other medium than himself.
</p>
<p>&quot;He [Burr] was sensible that no complete understand
</p>
<p>ing on the subject could well take place without verbal
</p>
<p>communication; but he flattered himself that enough
</p>
<p>might be explained in this way to give a commencement
</p>
<p>to the business, and that any ulterior arrangements might
</p>
<p>safely be left till the personal interviews he should have
</p>
<p>with the persons properly authorized for the purpose,
</p>
<p>whom he recommended to be sent with the ships of war,
</p>
<p>which it was necessary should cruise off the mouth of

</p>
<p>and to continue there until the commanding officers
</p>
<p>should receive information from him or from Mr. Daniel
</p>
<p>Clark of the country having declared itself independent.&quot;
</p>
<p>This splendid secret of the West declaring itself
</p>
<p>independent was not new to Merry, for the public
</p>
<p>prints, as Burr well knew, had only recently declared
</p>
<p>that a convention was soon to be called for just such a
</p>
<p>purpose. But in reality if such a proposition was ever
</p>
<p>. mooted save by industrious editors there is no trace
</p>
<p>of it.
</p>
<p>Ostensibly to secure the success of his undertaking
</p>
<p>Burr now requested that to his former^ estimate .of
</p>
<p>naval strength should be added~a number of
</p>
<p>&quot;smaller vessels ; because the overture which had been
</p>
<p>made to him at New Orleans from a person of the greatest
</p>
<p>influence in East and West Florida and the information
</p>
<p>he had otherwise acquired respecting the state of those
</p>
<p>countries, having convinced him that they are equally
</p>
<p>disposed to render themselves independent ; and while he
</p>
<p>had good reason to believe that the same spirit prevails
</p>
<p>in many other parts of the Spanish dominions on this
</p>
<p>continent, such force with that which he should be able
</p>
<p>to provide would be required to defend the entrance of
</p>
<p>the river and the coasts of Florida and to keep up a
</p>
<p>free communication with the sea and those places where
</p>
<p>it might be found expedient to act.&quot;
</p>
<p>Here was indeed another lever, which, so far as
</p>
<p>Burr could see, promised to be effective; but which in
</p>
<p>reality worked greatly to the injury of his cause
</p>
<p>if there had ever been a chance for it. So long as an

<p>attack on the integrity of the Union was in contempla

</p>
<p>&quot;other places where it might be found expedient to act&quot;
</p>
<p>within the scope of action was to close all avenues
</p>
<p>securely. True, England was at war with Spain, and
</p>
<p>an attack on the enemy, to all appearances, would be
</p>
<p>welcomed; but Burr was not aware that the British
</p>
<p>Ministry, while aiding Miranda, the South American
</p>
<p>patriot, in a minor way, were already considering
</p>
<p>plans for the absorption of the Spanish colonies, and
</p>
<p>would therefore look upon his enlarged scheme with
</p>
<p>disapprobation. In this connection Burr spoke of
</p>
<p>Miranda :
</p>
<p>&quot;At the last meeting I had with Mr. Burr,&quot; said
</p>
<p>Merry, &quot;he told me that he had just received notice from
</p>
<p>New York of the arrival there from England of General
</p>
<p>Miranda who appeared by his information to have been
</p>
<p>sent to this country by his Majesty s government, t* co
</p>
<p>operate with him in the plan of operations against South
</p>
<p>America.&quot;
</p>
<p>\ So there was a &quot;plan of operations against South
</p>
<p>America.&quot; Burr, however, disparaged Miranda s char
</p>
<p>acter, declaring that he possessed neither discretion nor
</p>
<p>talents. But if either Miranda or Burr thought Eng
</p>
<p>land disposed to carry on an unselfish war for the
</p>
<p>independence of Spanish America they were un
</p>
<p>acquainted with the history of the Tories. The dispo

<p>sition of the Spanish colonies &quot;to render themselves
</p>
<p>independent&quot; was the controlling fear of the Ministry.

<p>46 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>&quot;The great and ruling consideration which has so
</p>
<p>long restrained his Majesty from invading this part of
</p>
<p>the enemies territories [Spanish America], has been the
</p>
<p>fear of exciting in those countries, from their known
</p>
<p>impatience of their forms of government, a spirit of insur
</p>
<p>rection and revolt leading to consequences the most fatal
</p>
<p>and which except by the presence of a very superior force,
</p>
<p>his Majesty might not have the means of controlling.&quot;
</p>
<p>Burr never mentioned names, nor spoke in precise
</p>
<p>terms of his plans ; the results of his Western tour were
</p>
<p>exhibited to Merry only in broad outlines :
</p>
<p>&quot;Throughout the Western country,&quot; said he, &quot;persons
</p>
<p>of the greatest property and influence had engaged them
</p>
<p>selves to contribute very largely towards the expense of
</p>
<p>the enterprise ; at New Orleans he represented the inhabi
</p>
<p>tants to be so firmly resolved upon separating themselves
</p>
<p>from their union with the United States, and every
</p>
<p>way to be so completely prepared, that he was sure the
</p>
<p>revolution there would be accomplished without a drop
</p>
<p>of blood being shed, the American force in that country
</p>
<p>(should it not, as he had good reason to believe, enlist
</p>
<p>with him) not being sufficiently strong to make any
</p>
<p>opposition. It was accordingly there that the revolution
</p>
<p>would commence at the end of [March?] May 1 or the
</p>
<p>beginning of April, provided his Majesty s government
</p>
<p>should consent to lend their assistance toward it, and the
</p>
<p>answer, together- with the pecuniary aid which would be
</p>
<p>wanted, arrive in time to enable him to set out the begin
</p>
<p>ning of March.&quot;
</p>
<p>Burr frequently recurred to the urgency of an early
</p>
<p>reply to his propositions, especially emphasizing the
</p>
<p>necessity of an early remittance of funds, for upon the
</p>
<p>arrival of the latter depended the march of his enter

</p>
<p>secretly into his hands, as he indicated in his first over
</p>
<p>tures; and suggested that he would himself devise a
</p>
<p>way to get into his possession, without its becoming
</p>
<p>known or suspected, a part of the two hundred thou
</p>
<p>sand pounds which the United States were soon to pay
</p>
<p>to his Majesty s Government. In the end, failing in the
</p>
<p>first plan, proviso was made that one hundred and ten
</p>
<p>thousand pounds, which he now asked of Pitt, should
</p>
<p>be credited in the names of John Barclay of Philadel
</p>
<p>phia and Daniel Clark of New Orleans. Burr endeav
</p>
<p>ored to impress the Minister with the revolutionary
</p>
<p>state of affairs in Louisiana, bringing up again the ab
</p>
<p>surd notion that the inhabitants, though descendants of
</p>
<p>French and Spanish parents, were anxious to cast off
</p>
<p>their traditional hostility to England and to embrace
</p>
<p>her in the new cause.
</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Burr stated to me what I have reason to
</p>
<p>believe to be true from the information I have received
</p>
<p>from other quarters that when he reached Louisiana he
</p>
<p>found the inhabitants so impatient under the American
</p>
<p>government that they had actually prepared a representa
</p>
<p>tion of their grievances, and that it was in agitation to
</p>
<p>send deputies with it to Paris. The hope, however, of
</p>
<p>becoming completely independent, and of forming a much
</p>
<p>more beneficial connection with Great Britain, having
</p>
<p>been pointed out to them, and this having already pre
</p>
<p>vailed among many of the principal people who are
</p>
<p>become his associates, they have found means to obtain
</p>
<p>a suspension of the plan of having recourse to France;
</p>
<p>but he observed that if the execution of that which he
</p>
<p>had in view should be delayed beyond the time he had
</p>
<p>mentioned the opportunity would be lost; and France
</p>
<p>would, as he knew it positively to be her wish, regain

<p>that country and annex the Floridas to it.&quot;
</p>
<p>A more convincing presentation of the case could
</p>
<p>48 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>not have been made ; but the English Cabinet had cause
</p>
<p>to know that it was groundless France was not then
</p>
<p>playing for such stakes. Burr, however, was ignorant
</p>
<p>of the situation of affairs in Europe and continued to
</p>
<p>press the argument, which had always been so potent,
</p>
<p>of the danger from French interference. Merry be
</p>
<p>lieved the whole of the story, even to Burr s forecast
</p>
<p>of the dissolution of the Republic.
</p>
<p>&quot;He observed, what I readily conceive may happen,
</p>
<p>that when once Louisiana and the Western country
</p>
<p>became independent, the Eastern States will separate
</p>
<p>themselves immediately from the Southern ; and that thus
</p>
<p>the immense power which is now risen up with so much
</p>
<p>rapidity in the western hemisphere will, by such a
</p>
<p>division, be rendered at once informidable ; and that no
</p>
<p>moment could be so proper for the undertaking in ques
</p>
<p>tion and particularly for Great Britain to take part in it
</p>
<p>as the present, when she has the command of the ocean
</p>
<p>and France is prevented from showing that interference
</p>
<p>in the business which she would otherwise certainly
</p>
<p>exercise.&quot;
</p>
<p>Merry, while recommending the &quot;practicability and
</p>
<p>great utility&quot; of the project, thought that &quot;his Majesty
</p>
<p>may have already been disposed to take part in the
</p>
<p>affair.&quot; Thus completely had the Minister been
</p>
<p>blinded. Burr, however, realized that the winning over
</p>
<p>of the British Cabinet was quite another matter.
</p>
<p>Indeed it appeared from the unbroken silence almost
</p>
<p>hopeless. So he turned to other quarters, still with a
</p>
<p>view to obtaining the moneys he calculated necessary
</p>
<p>for his purposes. While in Washington he was cor-
</p>
<p>&quot; dially received at the White House. Yrujo said that

</p>

</p>
<p>replied :
</p>
<p>&quot;I hope, sir, you will not regard it indelicate in me
</p>
<p>to observe to you how highly I should be honored in
</p>
<p>being associated with you, in any contemplated enterprise
</p>
<p>you would permit me to participate in. ... Viewing

<p>event of an engagement against, or subjugation of, any

<p>of the Spanish territories, I am disposed, in the confiden

<p>tial spirit of this letter, to offer you my friends and my
</p>
<p>own services to cooperate in any contemplated measures
</p>
<p>in which you may embark.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>To this flattering note Burr sent in reply an explicit
</p>
<p>definition of the nature of his undertaking: 2
</p>
<p>&quot;I had projected, and still meditate, a speculation
</p>
<p>precisely of the character you have described. . . . The

<p>business, however, depends, in some degree, on contin

<p>the continent can interfere with that which I propose.

</p>
<p>Burr s revelations to Blennerhassett left no doubt
</p>
<p>as to the object in view. The contingencies upon which

<p>the conquest of Spanish regions, fired young and old

<p>alike; it was therefore not surprising to find characters

<p>Wilkinson and General Presley Neville anxious to par

<p>of the Government in its attempt to stem the flood of

<p>severely criticized for its tardiness in taking up the

<p>other nations.&quot; 1 From one end of the Republic to the
</p>
<p>other the Government was decried for its attitude,
</p>
<p>whether it endeavored to conceal evidences of Spanish
</p>
<p>meanness, or tried to steer clear of the breakers of
</p>
<p>war. The President sought to ease matters by purchas
</p>
<p>ing the Floridas. Though we claimed West Florida
</p>
<p>under the treaty for the sale of Louisiana, and had even
</p>
<p>passed a law regulating the collection of customs at
</p>
<p>Mobile, Jefferson thought the easiest way out of the
</p>
<p>embroglio was to pay out. But his plan encountered
</p>
<p>opposition in Congress. John Randolph, the one tow
</p>
<p>ering figure in the House, strenuously opposed it ; and
</p>
<p>sharply arraigned the President for having a &quot;double
</p>
<p>set of opinions and principles the one ostensible, the
</p>
<p>other real.&quot; In the first case he appeared in his Mes
</p>
<p>sage of December 3, 1805, to favor vigorous measures
</p>
<p>against Spain; in the second, three days later, he
</p>
<p>secretly appealed to Congress to appropriate moneys
</p>
<p>for the purchase of lands, a part of which he had pro
</p>
<p>fessed to believe already ours. In the midst of the dis
</p>
<p>cussion, January 3d, Randolph laid before the Repre
</p>
<p>sentatives a spirited, warlike report based on the Mes
</p>
<p>sage of December 3d. The closing resolution read that
</p>
<p>the Southern frontier was to be protected &quot;from Span
</p>
<p>ish inroad and insult.&quot; Indeed it went further : meas
</p>
<p>ures were to be resorted to which meant, beyond perad-
</p>
<p>venture, conflict with Spain. By plying the party lash

<p>Jefferson succeeded in having Randolph s Resolution

<p>carried his point, but the report of such a bill provoked
</p>
<p>more than partisan rebuke throughout the Union.
</p>
<p>&quot;There was a happy moment,&quot; ran a paragraph in the
</p>
<p>Orleans Gazette, 1 &quot;when the government of the United
</p>
<p>States, with every plea of justice and necessity on its
</p>
<p>side, might, at a blow, have expelled the Spaniards from
</p>
<p>our shores. It required nothing but the sanction of
</p>
<p>authority, and the generous spirit of the nation, which
</p>
<p>had left far behind the nerveless soul of the Government,
</p>
<p>would have performed the business even without a
</p>
<p>reward. ... If the wise counsels of Federal men had
</p>
<p>been listened to, we should in the twinkling of an eye,
</p>
<p>as it were, have the rightful possession of those terri
</p>
<p>tories, which form a natural and very important append
</p>
<p>age of our own.&quot;
</p>
<p>Editor Bradford of the Orleans Gazette was an un
</p>
<p>disguised revolutionist, and had admitted to his col
</p>
<p>umns, at the time of Burr s first visit to the West, an
</p>
<p>article which might have been copied in part from the
</p>
<p>annals of the French Revolution : 2
</p>
<p>&quot;By a war she [Spain] would have everything to lose,
</p>
<p>and nothing to win. ... To the east the Floridas
</p>
<p>would fall into our hands without opposition, and to the
</p>
<p>southwest, New Mexico, with all its wealth, opposes no
</p>
<p>obstacle to invasion. . . . This conquest would give us
</p>
<p>the key to the southern continent; and the soldiers of
</p>
<p>Liberty, animated by the spirit of 76 and the genius of
</p>
<p>their Washington, would go to the field, not with a hope
</p>
<p>of plunder, but to avenge the cause of their country, and
</p>
<p>to give freedom to a new world. The innocent blood of

</p>
<p>Bradford did not stand alone there were many
</p>
<p>others in the States who saw the matter as he ; for the
</p>
<p>maxims of the French Revolution were still living
</p>
<p>forces. The morbid sentiment indulged over the con
</p>
<p>dition of the inhabitants of the Spanish colonies is one
</p>
<p>more proof that nations are ofttimes blind to their own
</p>
<p>shortcomings. For why should charity not have begun
</p>
<p>at home in granting freedom to the negro slaves? By
</p>
<p>this it is not meant to question the sincerity of the
</p>
<p>enthusiasm of the American mind for the emancipation
</p>
<p>of the colonies of Don Carlos. On the contrary, there
</p>
<p>is every reason to believe in the honesty of the desire ;
</p>
<p>but it was so intermingled with the lust for revenge
</p>
<p>against a sovereign whose territories were coveted,
</p>
<p>that the measure of its intensity is lost.
</p>
<p>Favorable, even flattering, the situation appeared

<p>to the leaders of the conspiracy. There were few who

<p>dreamed of the difficulties to be overcome; of the need

<p>and distempers to be combated, which were to prove

<p>fatal in the end. Perhaps only Dayton and Wilkinson
</p>
<p>were in the innermost secret, and aided in devising

<p>ways and means. Wilkinson drew from his own expe-

<p>flect his handiwork, while he has left us convincing

</p>
<p>54 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>&quot;No doubt remains with me that he [Burr] has duped
</p>
<p>both the British and Spanish legations and converted
</p>
<p>them to his use, by the promise of the subversion of our
</p>
<p>Government on the one hand, and the revolutionizing of
</p>
<p>Mexico on the other.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>The knowledge of the stratagem which was to be
</p>
<p>used with the Ministers was well employed by Wilkin
</p>
<p>son when once he had begun his denunciations, for he
</p>
<p>was also aware that the country at large was con
</p>
<p>founded by the mingling of the two sets of arguments.
</p>
<p>Although Dayton and Burr were unpractised in the
</p>
<p>art of extracting specie from foreign coffers, they
</p>
<p>learned their lesson with so much facility that it was
</p>
<p>clear James Wilkinson had been their instructor. De
</p>
<p>cember ist, after his interviews with Merry, Burr
</p>
<p>reached Philadelphia whither Dayton had preceded
</p>
<p>him. There, December 5th, the Marquis of Caso Yrujo
</p>
<p>was secretly visited by Dayton, who was primed with
</p>
<p>an excellently prepared story which it was thought
</p>
<p>would bring Yrujo to the financial aid of the scheme.
</p>
<p>Dayton began by saying that he thought thirty or forty
</p>
<p>thousand dollars would not be an excessive sum to pay
</p>
<p>for certain events which were transpiring at London
</p>
<p>upon whose outcome hung the fate of the most precious
</p>
<p>possessions of the Spanish monarchy. Yrujo assured
</p>
<p>him that his master was liberal and would reward ser
</p>
<p>vices. Thus encouraged the ex-Senator began by say

<p>ing that he was one of three persons in this country

<p>norant of it, but not lss concerned than Spain. Then
</p>
<p>he continued: 1 ^
</p>
<p>&quot;Toward the close of the last session and the end of
</p>
<p>March, Colonel Burr had various secret conferences with
</p>
<p>the English minister, to whom he proposed a plan not
</p>
<p>only for taking the Floridas, but also for effecting the
</p>
<p>separation and independence of the States of the West,
</p>
<p>a part of this plan being that the Floridas shall be associ
</p>
<p>ated in this new federative republic; England to receive
</p>
<p>as a reward for her services a decisive preference in
</p>
<p>matters of commerce and navigation, these advantages
</p>
<p>to be secured by means of a treaty which will be made
</p>
<p>upon the recognition by England of this new republic.
</p>
<p>This plan met the approbation of the English minister,
</p>
<p>who recommended it to his court. In the meantime
</p>
<p>Colonel Burr has been in New Orleans, in the Mississippi
</p>
<p>Territory, the States of Tennessee, Kentucky, and Ohio,
</p>
<p>to sound and prepare their minds for this revolution. In
</p>
<p>all these States he found their dispositions most favorable
</p>
<p>not only for their emancipation which they evidently
</p>
<p>desire, but also for leading an expedition against the
</p>
<p>Kingdom of Mexico. This is an idea that occurred to
</p>
<p>us after sending the first plan to London; and having
</p>
<p>given greater extension to the project, Colonel Burr sent
</p>
<p>to London a dispatch with his new ideas to Colonel Wil
</p>
<p>liamson, an English officer who has been for a long time
</p>
<p>in this country, and whose return is expected within a
</p>
<p>month or six weeks. The first project was well received
</p>
<p>by the English Cabinet; more particularly by Mr,
</p>
<p>Dundas, or Lord Melville, who was charged with the
</p>
<p>correspondence; but as he had reason to fear dismission
</p>
<p>from office for causes well known through the debates of
</p>
<p>Parliament, the plan hasjjeen retarded ; but Mr. Pitt has

<p>again turned his attention to it. In order to effect the
</p>
<p>conquest of the Floridas and the emancipation of the
</p>
<p>Western States half a million dollars has been appropri

<p>ated j the expedition on the part of England will be com

</p>
<p>armed vessels which will bring arms, ammunition and
</p>
<p>artillery, but few men, as men were not needed.&quot;
</p>
<p>The conspirators never turned out a more palpably
</p>
<p>fictitious fabric. Yet with the strength of it Dayton
</p>
<p>and Burr hoped to bind Yrujo to the project; and
</p>
<p>somehow to terrify Don Carlos into paying the ex
</p>
<p>penses of an enterprise against his own possessions.
</p>
<p>The irony of it is fascinating. Yrujo was in a more
</p>
<p>treacherous situation than Merry. As for the latter,
</p>
<p>Burr employed his wiles to make him a catspaw to
</p>
<p>draw from the British treasury half a million dollars;
</p>
<p>while the former was to contribute funds for a secret
</p>
<p>which had been contrived to entrap him, to disguise the
</p>
<p>real object of the association, and which would have
</p>
<p>been revealed to him in any case. If an assault was
</p>
<p>really to be made on the Spanish provinces, it was but
</p>
<p>plain foresight to disarm Yrujo, or better still to leave
</p>
<p>him nursing the idea that his Sovereign was aiding in
</p>
<p>the dispersion of the Power in the Western World
</p>
<p>which menaced the integrity of his Empire.
</p>
<p>The Marquis was assured that the Western States
</p>
<p>would declare themselves independent the moment the
</p>
<p>English squadron appeared off the coast of Florida in
</p>
<p>February or March ; that in order to make the revolu
</p>
<p>tion more popular after having taken the Floridas the
</p>
<p>expedition against Mexico would be attempted; that
</p>
<p>Miranda had just been sent to this country by the Eng
</p>
<p>lish Government to act in concert with Burr; that no

<p>opposition from the feeble Federal Government was an

<p>in the West, and that Colonel Burr had caused them to
</p>
<p>BURR S INTRIGUES 57
</p>
<p>be sounded in regard to the expedition against Mexico ;
</p>
<p>that they were all ready to follow him and that there
</p>
<p>was no doubt they were also ready to support the rights
</p>
<p>of the Westerners against the impotent forces of the
</p>
<p>Federal Government. In the operations against Mex
</p>
<p>ico, England would cooperate by sea ; a landing would
</p>
<p>probably be made at Panuco. Dayton avowed that
</p>
<p>Burr had emissaries in the interior of the province of
</p>
<p>Texas, and that he had sent some also to Vera Cruz
</p>
<p>and other points on the coast with the moneys which he
</p>
<p>had already received from England; that he meant to
</p>
<p>convert into a republic or republics the Spanish prov
</p>
<p>inces which should be conquered or revolutionized.
</p>
<p>Yrujo observed to Cevallos that the acquisition of
</p>
<p>Louisiana had rendered inevitable the separation of the
</p>
<p>West from the Union within the space of two years,
</p>
<p>and that the Floridas would succumb to the revolution.
</p>
<p>He was confident, however, that the Administration
</p>
<p>would not be deceived by the wiles of Burr. Yrujo s
</p>
<p>distrust of Dayton, whom he recognized as Burr s
</p>
<p>spokesman, was great. He saw at once that England
</p>
<p>had not encouraged the affair to the extent of a hundred
</p>
<p>thousand pounds, for, had she done so, Dayton would
</p>
<p>not have come to him, as he said to Cevallos, the alert
</p>
<p>Minister of State, to play the part of the &quot;faithful
</p>
<p>thief, relating a secret, which, for many reasons, he
</p>
<p>was interested in concealing from him.&quot; Thus the
</p>
<p>main end sought had been accomplished Yrujo no
</p>
<p>longer credited the prevailing rumors that Mexico was
</p>
<p>the objective point, for, had it been so, the conspirators

<p>would not have been guilty of the folly of making a

<p>58 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>clean breast of it. However, partially successful though
</p>
<p>they had been, Burr and the ex-Senator feared they
</p>
<p>had gone too far ; so, when the latter returned to Phila
</p>
<p>delphia from a fortnight in Washington he was pre
</p>
<p>pared to unfold another story fantastic and absurd in
</p>
<p>the highest degree. But this time, singularly enough,
</p>
<p>Yrujo was completely taken in.
</p>
<p>After referring to Burr s resolve to have nothing to
</p>
<p>do with Miranda, whom he thought wanting in many
</p>
<p>qualities necessary to lead a great enterprise, Dayton
</p>
<p>made bold to say that the English end of the intrigue
</p>
<p>had met with reverses, hinting that negotiations in that
</p>
<p>quarter were abandoned; whereas we know the hopes
</p>
<p>of the conspirators in British aid were still high. Burr
</p>
<p>had been on the eve of dispatching to London an inti
</p>
<p>mate by the name of Wharton, continued Dayton, to
</p>
<p>renew the negotiations, when another plan had sug
</p>
<p>gested itself :*-
</p>
<p>&quot;This project, excepting the attack on the Floridas, he
</p>
<p>[Burr] thinks, as well as his chief friends, may be put
</p>
<p>in execution without foreign aid. For one who does not
</p>
<p>know the country, its Constitution, and, above all certain
</p>
<p>localities, this plan would appear insane; but I confess,
</p>
<p>for my part, that in view of all the circumstances it seems
</p>
<p>easy of execution, although it would irritate the Atlantic
</p>
<p>States, especially those called central namely, Virginia,
</p>
<p>Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and
</p>
<p>New York. It is indisputable that there is in this country
</p>
<p>an infinite number of adventurers, without property, full
</p>
<p>of ambition, and ready to unite at once under the standard
</p>
<p>of a revolution which promises to better their situation.
</p>
<p>It is almost certain that Burr and his friends, without dis

<p>men and inspired them with the greatest confidence in
</p>
<p>favor of Burr, whose intrigues during the past year were
</p>
<p>devoted to the fanning of the flames of discord against
</p>
<p>the existing government in Louisiana and the Western
</p>
<p>States which he visited.&quot;
</p>
<p>Burr s &quot;new idea, which Yrujo thought would
</p>
<p>&quot;probably be carried into effect,&quot; was to introduce by
</p>
<p>degrees into the Federal city and its environs a certain
</p>
<p>number of his desperate followers, well armed, who, at
</p>
<p>a signal, with Burr at their head would surprise at the
</p>
<p>same instant the President, the Vice-President, and the
</p>
<p>President of the Senate, Burr would then dissolve the
</p>
<p>existing government, possess himself of the public
</p>
<p>money deposited in the Washington and Georgetown
</p>
<p>banks and seize the arsenal on the Eastern Branch.
</p>
<p>Profiting by the consternation such a blow would pro
</p>
<p>duce, the conspirators would try to make favorable
</p>
<p>terms with the States ; but should they fail to maintain
</p>
<p>themselves at Washington, which seemed probable, they
</p>
<p>would burn the national vessels at the Navy Yards, ex

<p>cept two or three frigater which were ready for sea,
</p>
<p>and embarking on these with the treasure, they would

<p>sail for New Orleans, where upon their arrival they
</p>
<p>. would proclaim the independence of Louisiana and the

<p>West. 1
</p>
<p>It would be as easy to believe in the truthfulness of

<p>one of Baron Miinchausen s tales as that Burr seri

<p>ously contemplated so utterly harebrained an enterprise

<p>60 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>deceived for a double purpose, it would be legitimate
</p>
<p>to inquire into Burr s sanity. That such a high-handed,
</p>
<p>buccaneering plot had the shadow of a chance to reach
</p>
<p>maturity could not have been believed by any one
</p>
<p>acquainted with American character, or the actual situ
</p>
<p>ation of affairs. And yet Yrujo thought it certain of
</p>
<p>success, observing to Cevallos that &quot;Spain would view
</p>
<p>with extreme satisfaction the dismemberment of the
</p>
<p>i
</p>
<p>colossal power which was growing up at the very gates
</p>
<p>of her most precious and important colonies.&quot; The
</p>
<p>great difficulty to be surmounted in the execution of
</p>
<p>this momentous project was &quot;the acquisition of half a
</p>
<p>million or a million dollars which the principals calcu
</p>
<p>lated would be necessary to expend for provisions,
</p>
<p>arms, pay for men,&quot; et cetera. The solution was easy
</p>
<p>Burr had offered to sell his services to Spain, and
</p>
<p>Yrujo intimated that the King ought to come to his aid,
</p>
<p>for the following reasons :
</p>
<p>&quot;At a second conference with this subject [Dayton]
</p>
<p>he told me that Burr had authorized him to say that
</p>
<p>in this second project, which was the one determined
</p>
<p>upon, Spain had nothing to fear for her possessions ;
</p>
<p>that on the contrary he counted on her friendship because
</p>
<p>of her obvious interest in the success of the enterprise ;
</p>
<p>that the matter of the Louisiana boundary would be
</p>

<p>which would enable him to purchase ships, arms, and
</p>
<p>necessaries for the equipment of &quot;his expedition. So
</p>
<p>much was he encouraged with the situation that he
</p>
<p>wrote to Wilkinson, December I2th:
</p>
<p>**&amp;lt;
</p>
<p>&quot;About the last of October our cabinet was seriously
</p>
<p>disposed for war with the Spaniards; but more recent
</p>
<p>accounts of the increasing and alarming aggressions and
</p>
<p>annoyance of the British, and some courteous words from
</p>
<p>the French, have banished every such intention. In case
</p>
<p>of such warfare, Lee would have been commander-in-
</p>
<p>chief : truth I assure you : he must you know come from
</p>
<p>Virginia. . . . On the subject of a certain speculation,
</p>
<p>it is not deemed material to write till the whole can be
</p>
<p>communicated. The circumstance referred to in a letter
</p>
<p>from Ohio remains in suspense: the auspices, however, .
</p>
<p>are favorable, and it is believed that Wilkinson will give If
</p>
<p>audience to a delegation composed of Adair~and Dayton
</p>
<p>in February. Can 25 be had in your vicinity to
</p>
<p>move at some few hours notification?&quot; 1
</p>
<p>Burr regretted the peaceful course of Government
</p>
<p>the non-materialization of the Spanish War ; and his
</p>
<p>characterization of the political status was eminently
</p>
<p>correct. Concerning a certain speculation doubtless
</p>
<p>the intrigues with the Spanish and British ministers
</p>
<p>he could only give Wilkinson hope. The reference to
</p>
<p>Adair and Dayton and the question as to the number of
</p>
<p>men which could be had were intelligible only to the
</p>
<p>General.
</p>
<p>While waiting for replies to the representations

<p>which had been made by Merry and Yrujo to their re

<p>1806 he approached Commodore Truxton with the
</p>
<p>, proposition that he should command the naval arm of
</p>
<p>an expedition against Mexico; and to William Eaton,
</p>
<p>who was engaged in pressing before Congress a very
</p>
<p>doubtful claim to certain pecuniary restitutions, he laid
</p>
<p>bare not only the first plan, but also that which had so
</p>
<p>taken Yrujo : &quot;He would turn Congress neck and heels
</p>
<p>out of doors, assassinate the President (or what
</p>
<p>amounted to that),and declare himself the protector of
</p>
<p>an energetic Government.&quot; Believing in these hor
</p>
<p>ribly criminal designs of the ex-Vice-President, some
</p>
<p>time in March Eaton called on the President and sug
</p>
<p>gested that &quot;Colonel Burr ought to be removed from
</p>
<p>the country&quot; because he was dangerous in it. Either
</p>
<p>the post at Madrid or London was considered by Eaton
</p>
<p>a secure place for the exile of Mr. Burr. If anything
</p>
<p>could give rise to a suspicion of this informant s in
</p>
<p>tegrity, it is this conversation with Jefferson. It was
</p>
<p>in March, too, that Burr applied in person to the Presi
</p>
<p>dent for an appointment, which fact Jefferson notes in
</p>
<p>his &quot;Anas under date of April I5th. This coincident
</p>
<p>provokes the suspicion that Burr had bribed Eaton to
</p>
<p>prepare the ground for his personal application for a
</p>
<p>foreign appointment. Why were Madrid and London
</p>
<p>specified? Could Burr have planned to undertake at
</p>
<p>shorter range the intrigues which were then progress
</p>
<p>ing with those courts ? It was either that or a ruse, for
</p>
<p>Burr must have known in advance what Jefferson s

<p>reply would be. He had lost the confidence of the

<p>dent s words.
</p>
<p>BURR S INTRIGUES 63
</p>
<p>In the middle of April, Burr wrote Blennerhassett
</p>
<p>that the business, which depended on contingencies
</p>
<p>beyond his control, would not begin until December or
</p>
<p>January, if ever. 1 To Wilkinson he said :
</p>
<p>&quot;The execution of our project is postponed till Decem
</p>
<p>ber : want of water in Ohio, rendered movement imprac
</p>
<p>ticable : other reasons rendered delay expedient. The
</p>
<p>association is enlarged, and comprises all that Wilkinson
</p>
<p>could wish. Confidence limited to a few. . . . Burr
</p>
<p>wrote you a long letter last December, replying to a short
</p>
<p>one deemed very silly. Nothing has been heard from
</p>
<p>Brigadier since October. Is Cusion et Fortes right?
</p>
<p>Address Burr at Washington.&quot; 2
</p>
<p>&quot;Cusion and Fortes&quot; were officers on the frontier,
</p>
<p>Wilkinson the &quot;Brigadier&quot; confessed ; but Burr s ebjeet
</p>
<p>was not so much to find out whether they were &quot;right&quot;
</p>
<p>as to impress the general with the fact that the associa
</p>
<p>tion was enlarged and comprised all that he could wish.
</p>
<p>&quot;Want of water in Ohio&quot; was a clever way of saying
</p>
<p>that thus far he had failed in his purpose with Merry
</p>
<p>and Yrujo.
</p>
<p>While these things were occurring in the East the
</p>
<p>news of warlike preparations in Kentucky was making
</p>
<p>its way across Texas and the deserts of North Mexico
</p>
<p>to Captain-General Salcedo at Chihuahua. Early in
</p>
<p>1806 Antonio Cordero, Governor of the Province of
</p>
<p>Texas, had received notice that an expedition was
</p>
<p>being prepared in Kentucky which was to overrun the
</p>
<p>provinces of Mexico. This news had reached the Gov
</p>
<p>ernor, not through the instrumentality of Yrujo, but

<p>directly from the Spanish agents in Louisiana. The
</p>
<p>report was alarming.
</p>
<p>&quot;It is a very grave matter,&quot; responded Salcedo, April
</p>
<p>9th, 1 &quot;the information which your excellency has received
</p>
<p>and transmitted to me that some ten thousand men,
</p>
<p>subjects of the United States, are being prepared in Ken
</p>
<p>tucky (Quintoq), with the object of overpowering the
</p>
<p>uninhabited provinces of this kingdom and our Indian
</p>
<p>allies, with no respect for the boundaries of Louisiana.
</p>
<p>You will therefore take extraordinary precautions
</p>
<p>toward putting the country in a good state of defense
</p>
<p>by bringing up all the auxiliaries.&quot;
</p>
<p>The obnoxious Intendant Morales who had aroused
</p>
<p>hot indignation in the United States by closing the
</p>
<p>port of New Orleans, wrote from Pensacola to Viceroy
</p>
<p>Iturrigaray, &quot;There exists in New Orleans a strong
</p>
<p>party whose object it is to revolutionize the Kingdom
</p>
<p>of Mexico, and the conditions on the frontier are en-
</p>
<p>tirely favorable to such a design.&quot;/ He stated also
</p>
<p>that he had been reliably informed that the revolution
</p>
<p>was to be materially abetted by means of emissaries and
</p>
<p>papers which were to be circulated throughout the
</p>
<p>country. Many ecclesiastics were in the plot, and many
</p>
<p>subjects were already won over. 2
</p>
<p>Again from the frontier came the note of alarm.
</p>
<p>Francisco Viana, Inspector-General of the troops in

</p>
<p>neophytes, and vassal Indians are to fall into their hands.
</p>
<p>And I have neither munitions, arms, provisions, nor
</p>
<p>soldiers wherewith to uphold our authority. I have
</p>
<p>despatched a corporal, a trader, and four soldiers to the
</p>
<p>Tejas Indians, asking that they arm as many as possible
</p>
<p>and come to my assistance.&quot;
</p>
<p>The truth was, New Spain was in a wretched con
</p>
<p>dition, and Morales was clear-headed when he avowed
</p>
<p>that the situation was all the Americans could desire.
</p>
<p>But the most startling note in this correspondence was
</p>
<p>the unconscious revelation of the vital purpose of the
</p>
<p>enterprise.
</p>
<p>The disingenuous disclosures of Dayton had thus
</p>
<p>far produced only in part the desired effect. True, ,
</p>
<p>Yrujo had been thrown off his guard, but Cevallos had
</p>
<p>not been constrained to make the expected advances.
</p>
<p>New tactics were therefore devised, and Burr himself
</p>
<p>visited the Marquis in the final hope of obtaining funds
</p>
<p>and of leaving the minister in a helpless state of in
</p>
<p>certitude.
</p>
<p>&quot;The principal has opened himself to me,&quot; wrote

<p>Yrujo to Cevallos, May 14, 18O6; 1 &quot;and his communica

<p>tions have confirmed me in the idea not only of the possi

<p>bility, but of the facility of the execution of the project
</p>
<p>under certain circumstances to effect which pecuniary
</p>
<p>aid on our part and on that of France is wanted. I have

<p>been very circumspect in my answers and have not com

<p>promised myself in any way ; and when I return to Spain

<p>next spring I shall be the bearer of all the plan with the

<p>both from Louisiana and from Kentucky and Tennessee,
</p>
<p>with the same object. They all consider the interests of
</p>
<p>those countries united and in conformity with those of
</p>
<p>Spain and France; but the principal, or more correctly
</p>
<p>the principals, here do not wish to open themselves to the
</p>
<p>Emperor Napoleon s minister [Turreau], as they have no
</p>
<p>confidence in him. Consequently, it will be proper either
</p>
<p>not to communicate the matter at all to that Government,
</p>
<p>or to do it with the request that its representative here
</p>
<p>remain uninformed ; for I repeat, they have no confidence
</p>
<p>in him, and this has been a condition imposed on me in
</p>
<p>the communications I have received.&quot;
</p>
<p>If Bollman s report to Madison and Jefferson con
</p>
<p>cerning Burr s designs can be credited, Burr had di-
</p>
<p>Ivined Napoleon s project of absorbing not only Spain
</p>
<p>but also her American possessions, and hoped to gain
</p>
<p>for himself a slice of the crumbling empire. 1 It was
</p>
<p>therefore but a part v of wisdom to leave Napoleon, who
</p>
<p>was rising toward the zenith of his career, ignorant
</p>
<p>of any revolutionary scheme which threatened even re
</p>
<p>motely to cross his own astounding plans. The pre
</p>
<p>caution had been taken to ignore Turreau, but he knew
</p>
<p>nevertheless, through the press, which never ceased its
</p>
<p>speculations, of Burr s supposed enterprise for the sepa

<p>ration of the States, and wrote his home Government

<p>concerning it. Mentioning Miranda s departure, he

<p>&quot;The project of effecting a separation between the

<p>Western and Atlantic States marches abreast with this

<p>sion of the confederated States appears to me inevitable,
</p>
<p>and perhaps less remote than is commonly supposed ; but
</p>
<p>would this event, which England seems to favor, be really
</p>
<p>contrary to the interests of France?&quot;
</p>
<p>Turreau thought the Government ignorant of
</p>
<p>Burr s intentions ; and yet Yrujo in a letter of the same
</p>
<p>date, February I3th, remarked, &quot;It seems that the Gov
</p>
<p>ernment have penetrated the project of Colonel Burr,
</p>
<p>and in reality I am apprehensive lest the French minis
</p>
<p>ter fearing it prejudicial to his country has informed
</p>
<p>them.&quot; 1 It is amazing that such a perplexing con
</p>
<p>fusion in political affairs could have existed.
</p>
<p>Having failed in his personal effort to draw
</p>
<p>from the Spanish minister a pecuniary response, Burr
</p>
<p>tried a last resort he threatened Yrujo with abandon
</p>
<p>ing his favorable attitude toward Spain and with taking
</p>
<p>up again the web of his English intrigue, whose en

<p>tangling meshes involved the Floridas and Mexico.
</p>
<p>June Qth, Yrujo in some uneasiness wrote Cevallos on
</p>
<p>the subject. Burr had suddenly ceased to visit him,
</p>
<p>and Dayton explained that this was due to the fact that
</p>
<p>the new Government in England was anxious to under
</p>
<p>take the matter, and that Burr believed it would be
</p>
<p>more liberal with money advances as well as offer better
</p>
<p>means of protection. Dayton said that Burr was draw

<p>ing up supplementary instructions for Williamson, and

<p>that Bollman would sail within ten days for London
</p>
<p>to lay new propositions before the Ministry, and to in

<p>68 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>still the &quot;faithful thief,&quot; informed Yrujo that he had
</p>
<p>protested to Burr against his unprincipled ambition,
</p>
<p>and would oppose the attack on the Spanish possessions,
</p>
<p>which he deemed unjust and impolitic, in the Cabinet
</p>
<p>council which certain chiefs were to hold in New
</p>
<p>Orleans in the month of December, proximo. The ex-
</p>
<p>Senator suggested that the best way to banish such
</p>
<p>ideas from the heads of the leaders was to reenforce
</p>
<p>Pensacola and Mobile.
</p>
<p>While Yrujo believed to the last that the main de
</p>
<p>sign of the associates was the division of the Union,
</p>
<p>he had warned the officials in the Spanish provinces to
</p>
<p>be on the alert against surprise. He had, moreover,
</p>
<p>given Dayton encouragement in the substantial form of
</p>
<p>fifteen hundred dollars, and in soliciting for him from
</p>
<p>the King one thousand more along with a pension of
</p>
<p>fifteen hundred a year. 1 The pension was denied, but
</p>
<p>the Minister was licensed to pay Dayton, who had in
</p>
<p>deed demanded much larger sums, another thousand
</p>
<p>dollars. That was as far as Cevallos was disposed to
</p>
<p>go. He saw instantly that England had not espoused
</p>
<p>the cause of Burr, for at the moment Napoleon was
</p>
<p>free from Continental dangers and England was mak
</p>
<p>ing preparations for the defense of her own shores.
</p>
<p>Cevallos further hinted that Dayton had a greater in
</p>
<p>terest in &quot;selling&quot; the secret than in keeping it, 2 but in
</p>
<p>a later communication intimated to Yrujo that if the
</p>
<p>United States were determined to war with Spain
</p>
<p>some use might be made of the malcontents. The

<p>minister, however, was warned against committing
</p>
<p>himself or contributing money/ and finally in July a
</p>
<p>few positive lines declared that his Majesty did not
</p>
<p>wish to protect the designs of Burr. 2 Interested as
</p>
<p>Cevallos and Godoy were by Yrujo s dispatches, they
</p>
<p>scented danger in the obviously deceitful intrigue. The
</p>
<p>truth was, Spain had her hands already full, and it
</p>
<p>would have been fatuous for her to have become in
</p>
<p>volved in an adventure in the wilds of America which
</p>
<p>might have led to further reprisals.
</p>
<p>On the side of Great Britain a worse outcome at
</p>
<p>tended the endeavors of the conspirators. For almost
</p>
<p>two years Burr had maintained relations with Merry,
</p>
<p>but at the end he had only his good wishes not one of
</p>
<p>the cabinets had even so much as deigned to reply to

<p>consummate intrigue, Merry was recalled by Charles

<p>James Fox, Chief in the &quot;Ministry of all the Talents/
</p>
<p>who sent out in his place David Montague Erskine.

</p>
<p>very reluctantly, be under the necessity of addressing
</p>
<p>themselves to the French and Spanish governments. He
</p>
<p>added, however, that the disposition of the inhabitants of
</p>
<p>the Western country, and particularly Louisiana, to sepa
</p>
<p>rate themselves from the American Union was so strong
</p>
<p>that the attempt might be made with every prospect of
</p>
<p>success without any foreign assistance whatever; and
</p>
<p>his last words to me were that, with or without such
</p>
<p>support, it certainly would be made very shortly. From
</p>
<p>these and other circumstances I have little or no doubt of
</p>
<p>this enterprise being upon the point of execution. From
</p>
<p>a circumstantial statement of the letter to which I have
</p>
<p>alluded in my other dispatch, of a large sum of money
</p>
<p>having arrived in the Western country from New
</p>
<p>Orleans, it may be inferred, that offers have been made
</p>
<p>to France and Spain, and that they are lending their
</p>
<p>assistance to the undertaking. There seems also reason
</p>
<p>to suspect that the arrival of so large a body of Spanish
</p>
<p>troops and the force which is expected added to the
</p>
<p>present state of inactivity may well be connected with
</p>
<p>the object.&quot;
</p>
<p>Merry marveled that the Government should have
</p>
<p>remained &quot;so long in ignorance of the intended design.&quot;
</p>
<p>It was equally marvelous that after his long acquaint
</p>
<p>ance with Burr he should have thought him acting in
</p>
<p>concert with France and Spain. The truth was that
</p>
<p>Merry with all his information was more ignorant of
</p>
<p>what was actually brewing than Jefferson; and it
</p>
<p>would have been far more ingenuous to have confessed
</p>
<p>that he was now satisfied that Burr, from his conflict
</p>
<p>ing stories, was untrustworthy, and that his object was

<p>CHAPTER IV.
</p>
<p>Plans and Preparations
</p>
<p>*
</p>
<p>WHEN the summer of 1806 was well under
</p>
<p>way it was plain to Burr that his hope of
</p>
<p>deluding England into advancing money for
</p>
<p>his project must be abandoned; likewise the failure
</p>
<p>of the imposture tried on Yrujo no longer admitted of
</p>
<p>doubt. The only ray of consolation came from the
</p>
<p>far West where the Spaniards were reported to be
</p>
<p>encroaching on American soil. The cry of war again
</p>
<p>rang through the country ; and it soon became known
</p>
<p>that specific orders had been sent to General Wilkinson
</p>
<p>to drive the enemy beyond the Sabine at any cost and
</p>
<p>that meant the beginning of the long-delayed struggle !
</p>
<p>The match for igniting the conflict was in the hands
</p>
<p>of General Wilkinson would he apply it ? Both Day
</p>
<p>ton and Burr were doubtful. Whether he would con
</p>
<p>tinue his part or desert it depended wholly on circum
</p>
<p>stances. They knew he would act for what appeared
</p>
<p>to be his own advantage, regardless of affiliations or
</p>
<p>oaths, regardless of traditions or friendships. They
</p>
<p>had from their intimate association with him learned
</p>
<p>his weaknesses, and it was only by pandering to them
</p>
<p>that they hoped to retain his allegiance. He had writ
</p>
<p>ten rarely, had raised objections, and had made condi
</p>
<p>tions which were seemingly hard to overcome. He had
</p>
<p>sent a letter to Burr in October, 1805, which was
</p>
<p>&quot;deemed very silly&quot; ; and finally another dated May

</p>
<p>1 3th which Burr alleged that he destroyed at Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son s request. The General was at the moment dis
</p>
<p>patching troops to the Sabine frontier and expecting to
</p>
<p>be ordered thither himself. That he would there pre
</p>
<p>cipitate legitimately or otherwise the conflict was
</p>
<p>the anxious hope of the leading conspirators, who now
</p>
<p>proceeded to alarm him for his office, which the Presi
</p>
<p>dent was on the verge of assigning to another, and to
</p>
<p>beguile him with fictions as to the means and assistance
</p>
<p>which were expected. All the false batteries of Burr
</p>
<p>and Dayton were trained on Wilkinson s position.
</p>
<p>Flagrant as the procedure was, they had gone too far
</p>
<p>to retreat. To the General Dayton wrote briefly, and
</p>
<p>his nephew, Peter V. Ogden, was intrusted with the
</p>
<p>letter, which was dated July 24th :
</p>
<p>&quot;It is now well ascertained that you are to be dis
</p>
<p>placed in next session. Jefferson will affect to yield
</p>
<p>reluctantly to the public sentiment, but yield he will.
</p>
<p>Prepare yourself, therefore, for it. You know the rest.
</p>
<p>You are not a man to despair, or even despond, especially
</p>
<p>when such prospects offer in another quarter. Are you
</p>
<p>ready? Are your numerous associates ready? Wealth
</p>
<p>and glory ! Louisiana and Mexico ! I shall have time
</p>
<p>to receive a letter from you before I set out for Ohio
</p>
<p>OHIO/
</p>
<p>With Ogden went Samuel Swartwout, the younger
</p>
<p>brother of Robert, marshal of New York, who bore a
</p>
<p>letter from Burr to Wilkinson, which is celebrated as
</p>
<p>being the key to^ the conspiracy. Its date was July
</p>
<p>29th. The original version of it will never be known,
</p>
<p>as it was altered and deciphered in various ways by
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, who, four months after its receipt, auda

</p>
<p>render [it] to my satisfaction.&quot; 1 Such an admission
</p>
<p>was rendered more astonishing by his subsequent false
</p>
<p>swearing concerning it at Richmond. The famous
</p>
<p>document, as it is generally accepted, reads as fol
</p>
<p>lows :
</p>
<p>&quot;Your letter, postmarked thirteenth May, is received.
</p>
<p>At length I have obtained funds, and have actually com

<p>and under different pretences, will rendezvous on the

<p>Ohio first of November. Everything internal and ex
</p>
<p>ternal favors our views. Naval protection of England
</p>
<p>is secured. TnpUon is going to Jamaica to arrange with
</p>
<p>the admiral on that station. It will meet us at the Missis
</p>
<p>sippi. England, a navy of the United States, are ready
</p>
<p>to join, and final orders are given to my friends and fol
</p>
<p>lowers. It will be a host of choice spirits. Wilkinson
</p>
<p>shall be second to Burr only ; Wilkinson shall dictate the

<p>rank and promotion of his officers. Burr will proceed
</p>
<p>westward first August, never to return. With him goes
</p>
<p>his daughter ; her husband will follow in October, with a
</p>
<p>corps of worthies. Send forthwith an intelligent and
</p>
<p>confidential friend with whom Burr may confer ; he shall

<p>return immediately with further interesting details ; this

<p>is essential to concert and harmony of movement. Send

</p>
<p>then under proper injunctions. Our object, my dear
</p>
<p>friend, is brought to a point so long desired. Burr guar
</p>
<p>antees the result with his life and honor, with the lives
</p>
<p>and honor and the fortunes of hundreds, the best blood
</p>
<p>of our country. Burr s plan of operation is to move down

<p>rapidly from the Falls, on the fifteenth of November, with
</p>
<p>the first five hundred or a thousand men, in light boats
</p>
<p>now constructing for that purpose ; to be at Natchez
</p>
<p>between the fifth and fifteenth of December, there to meet
</p>
<p>you; there to determine whether it will be expedient in
</p>
<p>the first instance to seize on or pass by Baton Rouge. On
</p>
<p>receipt of this send Burr an answer. Draw on Burr for
</p>
<p>all expenses, etc. The people of the country to which we
</p>
<p>are going are prepared to receive us ; their agents, now
</p>
<p>with Burr, say that if we will protect their religion, and
</p>
<p>will not subject them to a foreign Power, that in three &quot;
</p>
<p>weeks all will be settled. The gods invite us to glory and
</p>
<p>fortune ; it remains to be seen whether we deserve the
</p>
<p>boon. The bearer of this goes express to you. He is a
</p>
<p>man of inviolable honor and perfect discretion, formed
</p>
<p>to execute rather than project, capable of relating facts
</p>
<p>with fidelity, and incapable of relating them otherwise;
</p>
<p>he is thoroughly informed of the plans and intentions of
</p>
<p>Burr, and will disclose to you as far as you require, and
</p>
<p>no further. He has imbibed a reverence for your char
</p>
<p>acter, and may be embarrassed in your presence ; put him
</p>
<p>at ease, and he will satisfy you.&quot;
</p>
<p>This letter has been grossly misinterpreted. With
</p>
<p>all Burr s misrepresentations there is not the faintest
</p>
<p>hint that New Orleans was to be sacrificed ; no allusion
</p>
<p>to a convention which was to be called for the purpose
</p>
<p>of declaring the independence of the Western States
</p>
<p>a point which had borne great weight in the Spanish
</p>
<p>and English intrigues ; but we are told plainly that an
</p>
<p>attack was to be made on the Spanish possessions, pos
</p>
<p>sibly beginning with West Florida at Baton Rouge.
</p>
<p>If policy dictated, which Wilkinson was to decide, that
</p>
<p>Baton Rouge should remain unmolested, they would

<p>pared to receive us; their agents, now with Burr, say

</p>
<p>that if we will protect their religion, and will not sub
</p>
<p>ject them to a foreign power, that in three weeks all
</p>
<p>will be settled.&quot; There had been Spanish agents with
</p>
<p>**f- iBurr, and one Fernandez had contracted in Philadel
</p>
<p>phia for a quantity of type destined for Mexico and cast
</p>
<p>for the Spanish language. 1 And we shall see that ther.e
</p>
<p>were other Mexicans interested in the cause. It was
</p>
<p>only in the matter of his resources that Burr attempted
</p>
<p>deception.
</p>
<p>Toward the end of July, Ogden and Swartwout
</p>
<p>started on their journey. A little later Bollman sailed
</p>
<p>for New Orleans bearing a duplicate of Burr s letter
</p>
<p>to Wilkinson, which the General received in due season.
</p>
<p>The first week in August, Burr accompanied by his
</p>
<p>daughter, a Colonel De Pestre, who had suffered in the
</p>
<p>French Revolution, and who now lived in New Jersey,
</p>
<p>and a few friends and servants followed Ogden and
</p>
<p>Swartwout over the Alleghanies. While stopping in
</p>
<p>Pittsburg, August 22d, Burr and De Pestre visited
</p>
<p>Colonel George Morgan, who resided near Cannons-
</p>
<p>burg, fifteen miles distant; there, during the progress
</p>
<p>of the dinner, Burr talked volubly. The Morgans
</p>
<p>afterwards testified that he observed that with two
</p>
<p>hundred men the President and Congress could be
</p>
<p>driven into the Potomac; that with five hundred New
</p>
<p>York City might be taken; and also, they admitted,
</p>
<p>averred in a jocular way that a &quot;separation of the
</p>
<p>I States must ensue as a natural consequence in four or
</p>
<p>five years.&quot; 2

<p>PLANS AND PREPARATIONS 77
</p>
<p>Apart from the utter nonsense of the first two
</p>
<p>propositions which no sane man could have seriously
</p>
<p>uttered a natural separation of the States in the
</p>
<p>course of time was not in harmony with Burr s precipi
</p>
<p>tate measures. When Burr had gone, Colonel Morgan
</p>
<p>invited the Chief-Justice of Pennsylvania, Presley
</p>
<p>Neville, and Samuel Roberts to hear his account of the
</p>
<p>meeting with the ex-Vice-President. The two latter
</p>
<p>wrote conjointly to Madison that &quot;To give a correct
</p>
<p>written statement of these conversations would perhaps
</p>
<p>be as unnecessary as it would be difficult. . . . Indeed,
</p>
<p>according to our informants, much more was to be cal
</p>
<p>culated from the manner in which things were said,
</p>
<p>and hints given, than from the words used.&quot; While
</p>
<p>predicting the separation of the States in the course of
</p>
<p>four or five years, Burr also spoke of a wide field about
</p>
<p>to be opened for talented and military men. 1 The Mor
</p>
<p>gans forgot to relate this fact at Richmond. 2 More
</p>
<p>over, George Morgan, in a letter to the President in
</p>
<p>January, 1807, after referring to the incident of the
</p>
<p>above meeting in which &quot;I and my sons had opened to
</p>
<p>them [Neville and Roberts] our opinions of Colonel
</p>
<p>Seville and Roberts to Madison, October 7, 1806; Letters
</p>
<p>in Relation.
</p>
<p>2 The Morgans went out of their way to show the President
</p>
<p>that they were his humble servants. When the trial was over at
</p>
<p>Richmond they returned through Washington and left a note at
</p>
<p>the White House : &quot;The three Morgans of Morganza have, from
</p>
<p>respect for Mr. Jefferson, called at his residence although know
</p>
<p>ing him to be from the city.&quot; It may be interesting to note that
</p>
<p>this family had once attempted to found a colony at New Madrid,
</p>
<p>a site opposite the mouth of the Ohio, under the aegis of the
</p>
<p>Spanish Crown; and had been vainly pressing before Congress

<p>since 1784 a claim to lands in Indiana, said to have been bought
</p>
<p>of the Indians. (Journal of Congress, iv., 341.) Was it possible
</p>
<p>they had seized this opportunity to curry favor with Jefferson?
</p>
<p>78 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>Burr s views/ 1 questioned the patriotism of Neville,
</p>
<p>soldier of the Revolution and leader of the forces sent
</p>
<p>by President Washington to quell the Pennsylvania
</p>
<p>riots. Neville had established a rendezvous for the
</p>
<p>&quot;genteelly disaffected.&quot; Morgan likewise noted that it
</p>
<p>was said a former aide of his was frequently there ; and
</p>
<p>that
</p>
<p>&quot;a Mr. Spence or Spencer, of the American navy, has
</p>
<p>lately been with him [Neville], and declared the disaffec
</p>
<p>tion of every officer in it. Being too far advanced in life
</p>
<p>to take an active part in these inquiries, I leave them to
</p>
<p>my sons ; who, I am happy to say, have imbibed the prin
</p>
<p>ciples of their father and of Thomas Jefferson from the
</p>
<p>commencement of our revolutionary war to the present
</p>
<p>day.&quot;
</p>
<p>Leaving Pittsburg, Burr and party continued to
</p>
<p>Belpre, and at the appointed time set foot on the island
</p>
<p>in the Ohio, where a most enthusiastic reception was
</p>
<p>tendered them. Blennerhassett, who had devoted his
</p>
<p>life to science and music, had been at last called into
</p>
<p>action by his failing fortune and maturing family. He
</p>
<p>had, apart from his island property, about thirty thou
</p>
<p>sand dollars invested ; but from this he derived so little
</p>
<p>income that he was always pressed for money. He
</p>
<p>was eager to reestablish himself by some bold stroke of
</p>
<p>speculation. Such an opportunity Burr at once pre
</p>
<p>sented in the purchase of the Washita lands, a Spanish
</p>
<p>grant to Baron Bastrop, in the heart of Louisiana-
</p>
<p>areas in time to be worth their millions. Moreover, be
</p>
<p>yond this positive investment was another and greater
</p>
<p>possibility. In the contingency of a war with Spain,

</p>
<p>which was deemed inevitable, from the position they
</p>
<p>should occupy on the frontier, the route was open to
</p>
<p>the wealth and empire of Mexico. Blennerhassett was
</p>
<p>captivated, borne away with the promise of things.
</p>
<p>Preparations were begun without delay; the last days
</p>
<p>of August found Burr and his associate in Marietta,
</p>
<p>where they purchased, through the firm of Dudley
</p>
<p>Woodbridge & Company, one hundred barrels of pork
</p>
<p>and let the contract to Colonel Barker whose estab
</p>
<p>lishment was seven miles above the town on the Mus-
</p>
<p>kingum for fifteen boats to be delivered the ninth of
</p>
<p>December. This fact alone explodes the oft-repeated
</p>
<p>statement that Burr planned to move down the Ohio
</p>
<p>by November 15th. 1
</p>
<p>During one of these visits to Marietta, early in
</p>
<p>September, Blennerhassett showed Woodbridge a map
</p>
<p>of Mexico, &quot;stating its advantages, wealth, fertility,
</p>
<p>and healthiness,&quot; and asked him to join the expedi
</p>
<p>tion. Woodbridge inferred from this, he said at the
</p>
<p>trial, 2 that the enterprise was aimed at Mexico. Blen
</p>
<p>nerhassett in his prison at Richmond, when told of
</p>
<p>this evidence, set down in his Journal, &quot;He has not yet
</p>
<p>told all the truth having suppressed my communica
</p>
<p>tion to him of our designs being unequivocally against
</p>
<p>Mexico.&quot;
</p>
<p>The island became forthwith the center of multi
</p>
<p>farious activities. A kiln was erected for drying corn,
</p>
<p>which was ground into meal and made ready for

<p>of the expedition which was to make them all rich ;
</p>
<p>and shortly there were many as enthusiastic as Blenner

<p>hassett himself.
</p>
<p>&quot;A number of young men,&quot; said a correspondent of
</p>
<p>Pittsburg, &quot;inhabitants of this town, amounting to seven,
</p>
<p>have set out with an intention to join Colonel Burr in
</p>
<p>his expedition against Mexico, among whom is Morgan
</p>
<p>Neville, son of General Presley Neville, and it is said,
</p>
<p>with the knowledge and consent of his father. . . .
</p>
<p>Also Thomas Butler, son of the late Colonel Butler ; Mr.
</p>
<p>Forward, printer and editor of the Tree of Liberty, and
</p>
<p>publisher of the United States laws by authority, after
</p>
<p>having made preparations was prevented from going by
</p>
<p>sickness. . . . General Neville has used his influence
</p>
<p>to promote it. Wilkins and his sons warmly advocated
</p>
<p>it.&quot; l
</p>
<p>To this paragraph the editor of the National Intel
</p>
<p>ligencer appended the following comment :
</p>
<p>&quot;From the above letter it would seem that some of
</p>
<p>the first characters in Pittsburg are implicated in the Burr
</p>
<p>conspiracy. But we cannot believe that they would ever j
</p>
<p>engage in a treasonable plot against their country. Colonel I
</p>
<p>Neville was a conspicuous character in our Revolutionary
</p>
<p>War he was an aide to the Marquis de La Fayette and
</p>
<p>in every situation in which he was placed has discharged
</p>
<p>his trust with fidelity to his country and honor to himself.
</p>
<p>. . . Yet the sons of those men are said to be concerned,
</p>
<p>and that too with the knowledge of their fathers. If
</p>
<p>this be the case, we cannot believe any treason is con
</p>
<p>templated. Men of tried worth and known patriotism \

</p>
<p>risk their all in an enterprise in which they have nothing
</p>
<p>to gain, and where their lives would be jeopardized.&quot;
</p>
<p>Apart from the enlistment of recruits and manifold
</p>
<p>duties, Blennerhassett is credited with having contrib
</p>
<p>uted a series of articles to the Ohio Gazette setting
</p>
<p>forth the expediency of a separation of the Western
</p>
<p>from the Eastern States. By whomever written, the
</p>
<p>articles could hardly have been issued in the interest of
</p>
<p>the conspiracy. For what service was a cold, cogent
</p>
<p>piece of argumentation whose conclusion was that in
</p>
<p>the course of years natural causes would sever the West
</p>
<p>from the rest of the Union expected to render the
</p>
<p>project of Burr, which, from all indications, was not to
</p>
<p>undergo a period of incubation ?
</p>
<p>Meantime Burr had traveled many miles. Septem
</p>
<p>ber 4, 1806, he entered Cincinnati, and became the
</p>

</p>
<p>He stated that the menacing attitude of the Spanish
</p>
<p>forces &quot;already encamped within the limits of our Gov
</p>
<p>ernment&quot; required that the militia should be ready for
</p>
<p>instant duty. He recited that the enemy had captured
</p>
<p>several citizens of the United States; had cut down our
</p>
<p>flag in the Caddo nation ; had compelled a party in the
</p>
<p>employ of the Government to return from exploring
</p>
<p>the Red River; &quot;and had taken up an unjustifiable and
</p>
<p>insulting position east of the river Sabine, in the Terri
</p>
<p>tory of Orleans.&quot; War was regarded as all but begun.
</p>
<p>. Jackson communicated to the President his willingness
</p>
<p>; to serve the country, and those who have followed his
</p>
<p>career know what that willingness meant. Jefferson
</p>
<p>replied December 3d to this first volunteer for the
</p>
<p>Spanish war: 1
</p>
<p>&quot;Always a friend to peace, and believing it to pro
</p>
<p>mote eminently the happiness and prosperity of mankind,
</p>
<p>I am ever unwilling that it should be disturbed as long
</p>
<p>as the rights and interests of the nation can be preserved.
</p>
<p>But whenever hostile aggressions on these require a
</p>
<p>resort to war, we must meet our duty, and convince the
</p>
<p>world that we are just friends and brave enemies.&quot;
</p>
<p>Jefferson chose still to philosophize, to remain non
</p>
<p>committal; but to have been frank he ought to have
</p>
<p>said to Jackson that for the present all idea of war
</p>
<p>with Spain had been abandoned ; that orders had gone
</p>
<p>forward to Wilkinson on the Sabine to remain abso
</p>
<p>lutely on the defensive, and that he believed a truce
</p>
<p>had already been agreed upon by the contending
</p>
<p>armies.

<p>PLANS AND PREPARATIONS 83
</p>
<p>The first week in October Burr met at Lexington
</p>
<p>Blennerhassett, Theodosia Alston and her husband.
</p>
<p>They had come away from the island, leaving it in the
</p>
<p>care of Mrs. Blennerhassett. Henceforth Lexington
</p>
<p>was to be the rendezvous, and there the organization
</p>
<p>was to be perfected. The purchase of the Bastrop
</p>
<p>lands was now effected.
</p>
<p>While Louisiana was under the Spanish flag, Baron
</p>
<p>de Bastrop had secured the grant of a tract of land,
</p>
<p>comprising about one million acres, situated in what is
</p>
<p>now North Louisiana on the Washita (Ouachita)
</p>
<p>River. Three-fifths of this had been obtained by
</p>
<p>Colonel Charles Lynch of Kentucky; but there were
</p>
<p>still some outstanding debts against the grant which he
</p>
<p>could not meet. At this juncture Burr contracted to
</p>
<p>take the whole under the following stipulations:
</p>
<p>&quot;Colonel Burr was to pay Edward Livingston,&quot; testi
</p>
<p>fied Lynch, 1 &quot;the amount of my purchase ; he also paid
</p>
<p>me four or five thousand dollars in money, and was to
</p>
<p>take up certain paper which I valued at thirty thousand
</p>
<p>dollars more.&quot; The deeds were recorded in Lexington,
</p>
<p>and now in truth a long step forward in the programme
</p>
<p>had been made.
</p>
<p>The possession of the Washita lands was a matter
</p>
<p>of secondary importance, and to be made use of only
</p>
<p>in case of emergency. Should the Government suspect
</p>
<p>them in their designs on Mexico, they would draw the
</p>
<p>cloak of settler about themselves ; should the Spaniards
</p>
<p>drive them back, they were citizens of a Republic capa
</p>
<p>ble of defending them. It was above all something tan-

</p>
<p>Recruits were now daily added to the list, and all
</p>
<p>attempts to disguise the purpose of the associates aban

<p>doned. &quot;The impression/ says Putnam, 1 &quot;to some ex
</p>
<p>tent prevailed that Burr s movement and purposes had
</p>
<p>some sanction of the general Government, and that in
</p>
<p>so far as they were directed against the crafty enemies
</p>
<p>of the Western settlements they deserved to meet with
</p>
<p>cooperation.&quot; According to Jefferson, Burr would ap
</p>
<p>proach men, propose his scheme, and, if they did not
</p>
<p>care to engage unless the Government approved, he
</p>
<p>would show a forged letter purporting to be from Dear
</p>
<p>born, which countenanced the expedition, and add that
</p>
<p>because of the President s absence he had not sanc
</p>
<p>tioned it. 2 In a letter of January 3, 1807, to Wilkinson
</p>
<p>Jefferson said that persons had been enlisted with the
</p>
<p>&quot;express assurance that the projected enterprise was
</p>
<p>against Mexico, and secretly authorized by this Gov
</p>
<p>ernment. Many expressly enlisted in the name of the
</p>
<p>United States.&quot; 3 That statement approximated the
</p>
<p>truth, if indeed it were not wholly true. Calculating
</p>
<p>on war, Burr knew the expedition would be counten
</p>
<p>anced; or, if peace ensued, Government might over-

<p>look the preparations as in the case of Miranda. Says
</p>
<p>Perkins in his Annals of the West, &quot;It appears that he
</p>
<p>[Burr] meant to invade Mexico, whether war or peace
</p>
<p>ensued between Spain and the United States.&quot; Gra
</p>
<p>ham, the Government s agent, who followed Burr
</p>
<p>southward, also bore witness to this purpose in the
</p>
<p>people, the following interview with Burr taking place
</p>
<p>at Natchez :*
</p>
<p>&quot;I mentioned to Colonel Burr that I had heard in the
</p>
<p>Western country of a considerable number of men, per
</p>
<p>haps two thousand, being collected for the purpose of
</p>
<p>invading Mexico. His reply was that he supposed that
</p>
<p>event was in the case of war with Spain. I told him
</p>
<p>no, that I had not understood it as depending on that
</p>
<p>condition/
</p>
<p>Had Burr at that moment been confronted with his
</p>
<p>three maps, 2 left in the possession of Dr. Cummins, he
</p>
<p>would have been put to some confusion to explain upon
</p>
<p>what contingency he had calculated to lead his expedi
</p>
<p>tion to Mexico. There is no hushing such clamorous
</p>
<p>witnesses, and Burr must have confessed that he had
</p>
<p>counted primarily on Wilkinson and war, and finally
</p>
<p>on the silent acquiescence of the authorities. The
</p>
<p>secret of these maps in broad outline is this : that noth
</p>
<p>ing less than the Empire of Spain in North America
</p>
<p>was at stake. One map shows that Empire stretch
</p>
<p>ing away to the Californias and to the Isthmus; the
</p>
<p>second is an admiralty chart of the Gulf coast of that
</p>
<p>country, indicating inlets, islands, and depths, which
</p>
<p>could have been of service only to a sea expedition;

</p>
<p>the third (here reproduced) tells its tale in the de
</p>
<p>tailed topographical description of the region between
</p>
<p>Vera Cruz and Mexico City! Wilkinson, Adair,
</p>
<p>Truxton, and others confessed that Vera Cruz was
</p>
<p>the objective point of the sea expedition the maps
</p>
<p>reinforce them. Had Burr s project gone forward, the
</p>
<p>world might have been treated to a spectacle in some of
</p>
<p>its aspects recalling the story of Cortez. For was not
</p>
<p>Burr to profit by internal dissensions to conquer the
</p>
<p>land where for three centuries the Spaniards had ruled
</p>
<p>as tyrants? And were not the men he hoped to lead
</p>
<p>of that rare breed known as adelantados and conquis-
</p>
<p>tadores adventurers and filibusters?
</p>
<p>The absorbing plan of invading the Spanish posses-
</p>
<p>sions was to be determined by force and opportunity.
</p>
<p>The idea of penetrating the neighboring territories,
</p>
<p>of making conquests of them, was in the air of the
</p>
<p>time, and not due in the remotest sense to the influ
</p>
<p>ence of Burr. He strove merely for its embodiment.
</p>
<p>Though he failed, history emphatically shows that his
</p>
<p>plans were opportune, and that their wreck was due
</p>
<p>to influences he had failed properly to estimate, and
</p>
<p>chiefly to the conduct of James Wilkinson. The Span
</p>
<p>iards believed the conspiracy to have had a continuous
</p>
<p>existence, crediting it with the revolutionizing of West
</p>
<p>Florida in 1810, and a little later with having served as
</p>
<p>the inspiration for the Gutierrez-Magee Expedition, 1
</p>
<p>which wrought such irremediable destruction in the

<p>high hopes of cooperating in the revolution which
</p>
<p>raged beyond the Rio Grande. It was in the opening

<p>year of our second war with Great Britain that de

<p>warlike characters adventurers and revolutionists to

<p>the number of five hundred gathered along the Louisi

<p>ana frontier and in the Neutral Ground, marched
</p>
<p>across Texas, annihilated three royalist armies, and
</p>
<p>held the province until dissensions prepared them for
</p>
<p>destruction. That Burr planned, in case of necessity, to
</p>
<p>make a &quot;neutral ground&quot; of his Bastrop lands scarcely
</p>
<p>Admits of doubt; many of the followers of Magee had
</p>
<p>been his loyal partisans; and those who joined in the
</p>
<p>filibustering enterprises which swept westward for the
</p>
<p>next half century were his disciples.
</p>
<p>Pursuing his tactics Burr wrote to Governor Harri

<p>had Jackson, to issue a proclamation to th e militia. To

<p>for Burr. Every day brought more warlike tidings

</p>
<p>the foe, and greater prospect of a violent clash between
</p>
<p>the American and Spanish armies which now stood
</p>
<p>facing each other across the Arroyo Hondo. It is plain
</p>
<p>from his letter to Governor Harrison that Burr mo
</p>
<p>mentarily expected Wilkinson to redeem his pledge
</p>
<p>that a war could and would be brought about. Upon
</p>
<p>the receipt of such news Burr s banner would be raised,

<p>His absence, however, did not deter the boisterous

<p>militiamen from threatening a reprisal upon the island.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Blennerhassett became uneasy and sent her gar
</p>
<p>dener, Peter Taylor, in search of her husband. Octo
</p>
<p>ber 2Oth he set out. On his way he stopped in Cincin

<p>nati to inquire of Senator John Smith the whereabouts
</p>
<p>of Blennerhassett. Smith, having become alarmed at
</p>
<p>the malignant rumors in circulation, seized the op
</p>
<p>portunity to send a note to Burr demanding an ex
</p>
<p>planation.
</p>
<p>&quot;I was greatly surprised and really hurt by the un
</p>
<p>usual tenor of your letter of the 23d,&quot; Burr vouchsafed
</p>
<p>in answer to the Senator, 1 &quot;and I hasten to reply to it,
</p>
<p>as well for your satisfaction as my own. If there exists
</p>
<p>any design to separate the Western from the Eastern
</p>
<p>States, I am totally ignorant of it. I never harbored or
</p>
<p>expressed any such intention to any one, nor did any
</p>
<p>person ever intimate such design to me.&quot;

<p>according to his own story, he saw Burr for the first

<p>&quot;If you come up our way, the people will shoot you.&quot;
</p>
<p>Taylor s account of this meeting is sufficient to dis-\

<p>his evidence that Blennerhassett had told him what

<p>was reserved for those in the innermost circle of the

<p>a Burr to Smith, October 26, 1806; Senate Reports, p. 33.
</p>
<p>90 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>Colonel Burr had made fortunes for many in his time,
</p>
<p>but none for himself; but now he was going to make
</p>
<p>something for himself. He said that he had a great many
</p>
<p>friends in the Spanish territory ; no less than 2,000
</p>
<p>Roman Catholic priests were engaged, and that all their
</p>
<p>friends too would join, if once he could get to them ; that
</p>
<p>the Spaniards, like the French, had got dissatisfied with
</p>
<p>their government, and wanted to swap it.&quot;
</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the Spanish colonies were indeed
</p>
<p>tired of their Government. This was so manifestly the
</p>
<p>case in West Florida that even the faint-hearted Clai-
</p>
<p>borne thought there would be no difficulty in acquiring
</p>
<p>the territory. &quot;A great majority of the people of the
</p>
<p>Baton Rouge settlement,&quot; he said, March 3, 1806, to
</p>
<p>Jefferson, &quot;are well affected to the United States, and
</p>
<p>anxious for a change of government.&quot; 1 The history of
</p>
<p>the subversion of the Spanish rule in Mexico adds most
</p>
<p>effective weight to this testimony. The priests were
</p>
<p>the agitators and the leaders in the terrible revolt which
</p>
<p>began in September, 1810, and which was to end with
</p>
<p>Mexican freedom. Had Burr been able to unite the ele
</p>
<p>ments in opposition to the foreigner in Mexico, then
</p>
<p>indeed might he have been king ; and Wilkinson s taunt
</p>
<p>in a letter to Jefferson concerning Burr s overrunning
</p>
<p>of Mexico that it would receive a new master in the
</p>
<p>place of promised liberty would have been full of
</p>
<p>significance.
</p>
<p>The news reported by Mrs. Blennerhassett was of
</p>
<p>sufficient gravity to call her husband away from the
</p>
<p>little group of revolutionists already diminished by
</p>
<p>the return of the Alston family to South Carolina

</p>
<p>and the rest to bear reports to those who remained in

<p>izing of the States was progressing rapidly, and to
</p>
<p>assure the Marquis that the report that Mexico was to
</p>
<p>be invaded had been circulated to hide the main design.

<p>But before De Pestre had reached his destination the

</p>
<p>&quot;It is indubitable that Colonel Burr and his subordi

<p>of their intentions instead of deterring has only confirmed

<p>them in the revolution, whose success alone can save
</p>
<p>them. Some of his associates at this place and at New

<p>to me to be his intention to profit by the hostile appear

<p>rupture with Spain. I am confirmed in this opinion by

<p>a proclamation from the hand of one General Jackson of

<p>militia to chastise the insulting Spaniards.&quot;
</p>
<p>So ignorant was Yrujo of the real posture of af

<p>fairs in the West, he could not conceive that such a
</p>
<p>proclamation truly betokened patriotism ; it was to him
</p>
<p>a mere subterfuge, for he had been accustomed, and the
</p>
<p>conspirators had fostered his predilection, to think

<p>of the Westerners as openly hostile to the Union. It

<p>92 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>marshaled for the conquest of his Sovereign s terri
</p>
<p>tories, might take things by surprise.
</p>
<p>Burr s force was to consist of five hundred men,
</p>
<p>chiefly from New York, who were to rendezvous at
</p>
<p>Marietta. Then, continued Yrujo :
</p>
<p>&quot;Colonel Burr will go down with them under the pre
</p>
<p>text of establishing them on a great land purchase he is
</p>
<p>supposed to have made. In passing Cincinnati they
</p>
<p>expect to seize five thousand stand of arms which the Gov
</p>
<p>ernment deposited there at the time of its difference with
</p>
<p>us about the navigation of the Mississippi. After thus
</p>
<p>dropping the mask, this armed troop will follow down
</p>
<p>the course of the Mississippi. Colonel Burr will remain
</p>
<p>at Natchez till the Assembly of New Orleans has met,
</p>
<p>which will happen at once; and in this meeting (junta)
</p>
<p>they will declare the independence of the Western States,
</p>
<p>and will invite Burr to place himself at the head of their
</p>
<p>Government. He will accept the offer, will descend to
</p>
<p>New Orleans, and will set to work, clothed in a character
</p>
<p>which the people will have given him. I understand that
</p>
<p>Colonel Burr has already written the declaration of inde
</p>
<p>pendence, and that it is couched in the same terms that
</p>
<p>the States adopted in theirs against Great Britain. This
</p>
<p>circumstance is the more notable inasmuch as the actual
</p>
<p>President was the person who drew it up in 1776. When
</p>
<p>Burr made the project of acting in agreement with Eng
</p>
<p>land and seizing the Floridas, he expected to master them
</p>
<p>with troops that should accompany him from Baton
</p>
<p>Rouge. Although I am assured that this project is aban
</p>
<p>doned, and that, on the contrary, he wishes to live on
</p>
<p>good terms with Spain, I have written to Governor Folch
</p>
<p>of West Florida to be on his guard ; and although I am
</p>
<p>persuaded that, by means of Governor Folch s connection

<p>with General Wilkinson, he must be perfectly informed
</p>
<p>of the state of things and of Burr s intentions, I shall
</p>
<p>write to-day or to-morrow another letter to the Governor
</p>
<p>of Baton Rouge to be on the alert.&quot;
</p>
<p>It is puzzling that Yrujo should not have known
</p>
<p>PLANS AND PREPARATIONS 93
</p>
<p>that Wilkinson s term of pensioner had expired. Had
</p>
<p>he been aware of this fact his anxiety for the safety of
</p>
<p>the southern provinces might justly have increased,
</p>
<p>although he believed the governors in that quarter to
</p>
<p>be well informed of the course of events through the
</p>
<p>press of New Orleans and Natchez. His perplexity
</p>
<p>was indeed augmented through a letter from Burr
</p>
<p>which De Pestre delivered about November 27, 1806,
</p>
<p>preparatory to his report: 1
</p>
<p>&quot;About eight days ago,&quot; said Yrujo to Cevallos,
</p>
<p>December 4th, &quot;a former French officer, one of Burr s par
</p>
<p>tisans, presented himself here; he is just from Kentucky
</p>
<p>in search of various things needful to the enterprise. . . .
</p>
<p>This officer brought me a letter of recommendation from
</p>
<p>Burr, in which he said simply that the bearer, who had
</p>
<p>recently been in the Western States, could give me in
</p>
<p>formation about them to satisfy my curiosity. The date
</p>
<p>of this letter was Lexington, October 25th.&quot;
</p>
<p>Yrujo was assured that all was going well with
</p>
<p>Burr s affairs, and that by December 5th the adven
</p>
<p>turers from all parts would concentrate at Marietta.
</p>
<p>The body of the message ran as follows :
</p>
<p>&quot;He also told me, on the part of the Colonel, that 1
</p>
<p>should soon hear that it was his intention to attack
</p>
<p>Mexico, but that I was not to believe such rumors ; that
</p>
<p>on the contrary his plans were limited to the emancipa
</p>
<p>tion of the Western States, and that it was necessary to
</p>
<p>circulate this rumor in order to hide the true design of
</p>
<p>his armaments and of the assemblages of men which
</p>
<p>could no longer be concealed; that Upper and Lower
</p>
<p>Louisiana, the States of Tennessee and Ohio, stood ready
</p>
<p>and ripe for his plans, but that the State of Kentucky was

<p>94 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>much divided ; and as this is the most important in
</p>
<p>numbers and population, an armed force must be pro
</p>
<p>cured strong enough to overawe the opposition. He
</p>
<p>added, on Burr s part, that as soon as the revolution
</p>
<p>should be complete, he would treat with Spain in regard
</p>
<p>to boundaries, and would conclude this affair to her entire
</p>
<p>satisfaction ; meanwhile he wished me to write to the
</p>
<p>Governor of West Florida to diminish the burdens of
</p>
<p>Americans who navigated the Mobile River, and ask him,
</p>
<p>when the explosion should take place, to stop the courier
</p>
<p>or couriers which the friends of Government might dis
</p>
<p>patch, since it was desirable to delay the report of the
</p>
<p>happenings in the West.&quot;
</p>
<p>However successful Burr had been in the earlier
</p>
<p>phase of his intrigue with Yrujo, nothing could have
</p>
<p>been plainer to the Minister than that the conspirators,
</p>
<p>who had now nothing to gain from his cooperation,
</p>
<p>were lulling him into drowsy security. Yrujo would
</p>
<p>have been blind indeed had he not discovered that the
</p>
<p>Westerners were massing, not to overawe Kentucky,
</p>
<p>but to take for themselves certain properties which
</p>
<p>were destined to belong a little longer to Carlos IV.
</p>
<p>Yrujo confessed that Burr in sending him this officer
</p>
<p>had &quot;inspired him with the liveliest apprehensions.&quot;
</p>
<p>And he renewed his warnings to the officers in Florida,
</p>
<p>Texas, and Mexico.
</p>
<p>After his interview with Yrujo, De Pestre went to
</p>
<p>New York, where he met that contingent which was to
</p>
<p>have gone round by sea to New Orleans. But every
</p>
<p>thing was now in confusion because of the President s
</p>
<p>denunciation of the enterprise through his Proclama
</p>
<p>tion of November 27th. 1 Still, hope of ultimate suc-

</p>
<p>cess was not abandoned, and De Pestre returned in a
</p>
<p>fortnight to Philadelphia, and once more called upon
</p>
<p>Yrujo, to whom he related that Swartwout, Dr. Erwin,
</p>
<p>Colonel Smith, and Captain Lewis of the merchant-
</p>
<p>ship Emperor would soon set off for New Orleans. De
</p>
<p>Pestre further stated r 1
</p>
<p>&quot;that the youths enlisted to serve as officers should set
</p>
<p>out as soon as possible for their posts. These, my in
</p>
<p>formant told me, are different. Some two or three of
</p>
<p>them, the quickest and keenest, go to Washington to
</p>
<p>observe the movements of Government, to keep their
</p>
<p>friends in good disposition, and to dispatch expresses
</p>
<p>with news of any important disposition or occurrence.
</p>
<p>Three go to Norfolk to make some dispatch of provisions.
</p>
<p>A good number of them will go direct to Charleston to
</p>
<p>take command as officers, and see to the embarkation of
</p>
<p>the numerous recruits whom Colonel Burr s son-in-law
</p>
<p>has raised in South Carolina. He himself will then have
</p>
<p>returned there from Kentucky, and will embark with
</p>
<p>them for New Orleans. The rest will embark directly
</p>
<p>for that city from New York.&quot;
</p>
<p>This time the Marquis plied De Pestre with such
</p>
<p>questions as, Why, if the separation of the States is the
</p>
<p>object, was it necessary to prepare such quantities of
</p>
<p>provisions? and Why the State of Kentucky had be
</p>
<p>come obstinate ? It appears from Yrujo s account that
</p>
<p>De Pestre was almost driven from his ground. Indeed,
</p>
<p>he was taunted for his dissembling. Blennerhassett
</p>
<p>gave it on the authority of the Frenchman who re
</p>
<p>lated the whole of the circumstances to him while at
</p>
<p>Richmond that Yrujo &quot;pierced the cobweb tissue of
</p>
<p>Burr s intrigues with him at a single glance.&quot;

</p>
<p>96 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>&quot;He assured De Pestre,&quot; the Journal records, 1 &quot;that
</p>
<p>had Burr opened his designs with frankness, and really
</p>
<p>projected a severance of the Union, and nothing hostile
</p>
<p>to the Spanish provinces, he, Burr, might have had an
</p>
<p>easy resort to the Spanish treasury and its arsenals. But
</p>
<p>Yrujo laughed at the awkwardness with which Burr
</p>
<p>endeavored to mask his designs on Mexico.&quot;
</p>
<p>Such a moment of satisfaction Yrujo could not
</p>
<p>have enjoyed. It was not until De Pestre came on the
</p>
<p>stage that the Marquis realized how thoroughly he had
</p>
<p>been entrapped. He was now convinced that Burr
</p>
<p>planned a descent upon Mexico, and realized that the
</p>
<p>only barrier which stood between the adventurer and
</p>
<p>his goal was Wilkinson. So he wrote with the deepest
</p>
<p>complacency some weeks later that Spain had saved
</p>
<p>herself and the United States by pensioning Wilkinson,
</p>
<p>who had entered into Burr s design for the division of
</p>
<p>the Union, but rebelled at his plan for the conquest of
</p>
<p>Mexico. *
</p>
<p>While Yrujo was enjoying this special confidence
</p>
<p>of the associates, the stories of the conspiracy which
</p>
<p>were already rife in the States spread naturally into
</p>
<p>the very provinces the Spanish Minister was most ex
</p>
<p>ercised about. Some project had been ascribed to Burr
</p>
<p>as early as July, 1805, an&amp;lt; 3 since that date the Spanish
</p>
<p>governors had not been lacking information from
</p>
<p>Yrujo, from the press of the States, and from local
</p>
<p>connections. Although Yrujo knew Burr to be at
</p>
<p>the head of the project, with the ostensible design of

</p>
<p>disrupting the Union, the administrators in the prov
</p>
<p>inces of Don Carlos thought the movement directed by
</p>
<p>the Government of the United States, whose object was
</p>
<p>solely the extension of boundaries. Grand Pre, sta
</p>
<p>tioned at Baton Rouge, had become alarmed, and wrote
</p>
<p>Claiborne as early as April i, 1806, that he understood
</p>
<p>hostile preparations against his province were making
</p>
<p>in Mississippi. Claiborne replied, &quot;Your Excellency s
</p>
<p>letter of the first instant, has been received, and to quiet
</p>
<p>your apprehensions as far as is in my power, I hasten to
</p>
<p>assure you that I have never before heard of the hostile
</p>
<p>preparations which you seem to think are on foot in the V
</p>
<p>Mississippi Territory.&quot; 1 But Claiborne had forgotten
</p>
<p>that he had said in a dispatch to Washington that West
</p>
<p>Florida was ready to revolt, and that hostile arma
</p>
<p>ments were organizing. Kemper one of the filibust
</p>
<p>ering brothers of that name in Mississippi bore wit
</p>
<p>ness to that when he said that Burr s corps, which were
</p>
<p>forming in that Territory, meant to attack Baton
</p>
<p>Rouge; and Wilkinson likewise testified to the open
</p>
<p>hostility of the Territory under Meade, the latter hav
</p>
<p>ing expressed the wish that the Spanish cavalry would
</p>
<p>intercept the General on his ride to the frontier in Sep
</p>
<p>tember, &quot;because if this did not happen we should have
</p>
<p>no war. The same man,&quot; said Wilkinson, &quot;before I
</p>
<p>reached Natchez actually talked of attacking Baton
</p>
<p>Rouge.&quot; 2 Early in the fall Vicente Folch, Governor
</p>
<p>of West Florida, was advised of the scheme and of

</p>
<p>diately hurried information to Mexico. Again, on
</p>
<p>October I st, he sent a message to the Viceroy :
</p>
<p>&quot;You have already been informed of the project to
</p>
<p>revolutionize Mexico. This enterprise has not been lost
</p>
<p>sight of, and seems to be stronger than ever. According
</p>
<p>to the plan, if the weather permits, in February or March
</p>
<p>ten thousand Kentuckians, three thousand regular troops,
</p>
<p>eight or ten thousand militia from Louisiana, who will
</p>
<p>be forced to go, will march for Mexico. They will raise
</p>
<p>a corps of five thousand blacks, who will be taken from
</p>
<p>the plantations and declared free. This will make an
</p>
<p>army of from twenty-eight to thirty thousand men; five
</p>
<p>thousand will be reserved for the city of New Orleans.
</p>
<p>Baton Rouge and Pensacola will probably be the first
</p>
<p>taken. . . . After that, Natchitoches will be the point
</p>
<p>for the reunion. Part of the army will be embarked to
</p>
<p>land at the Rio Grande. The pretext for this expedition
</p>
<p>is afforded by the presence of the Spanish troops at
</p>
<p>Adayes. Congress will act only on the defensive, but if
</p>
<p>onCe these troops are united they will march toward
</p>
<p>Mexico with great proclamations.&quot;
</p>
<p>Without doubt Folch had grains of truth with his
</p>
<p>chaff; but here again Burr s project was swallowed up
</p>
<p>in the larger purpose attributed to the nation. That
</p>
<p>! the movement was directed wholly against Spain was
</p>
<p>i indubitable. There was not a hint nor even a suspicion
</p>
<p>that the West, according to Yrujo s advices, was first
</p>
<p>to be revolutionized. To those viewing the situation
</p>
<p>at short range his disclosures appeared but idle proph
</p>
<p>ecy; of national aggressiveness, on the other hand,
</p>
<p>there were unmistakable signs, and its direction was
</p>
<p>undoubted.

<p>PLANS AND PREPARATIONS 99
</p>
<p>Amid all these eddying reports and rumors, the
</p>
<p>Government at Washington, harassed by Pitt, teased
</p>
<p>by Napoleon, and defied by Godoy, labored heedless of
</p>
<p>the gathering storm on a near horizon. It was toward
</p>
<p>the end of October before the Administration thought
</p>
<p>the matter of the conspiracy worth its attention. Vari
</p>
<p>ous letters and the notice of the organization of the
</p>
<p>Wood County militia had been received, but there was
</p>
<p>nothing tangible in any of the communications. Octo
</p>
<p>ber 1 3th one James Taylor wrote to Madison from
</p>
<p>Kentucky that the scheme in question was to seize the
</p>
<p>Congress lands and to separate the States; that Blen-
</p>
<p>nerhassett, who had fled to this country, was reported
</p>
<p>to have written the articles signed &quot;Querist&quot;; 1 that
</p>
<p>Woodbridge & Company of Marietta were building ten
</p>
<p>gunboats, or strong vessels resembling them, at a navy
</p>
<p>yard seven miles up the Muskingum. 2 Long before
</p>
<p>this, however, Jefferson had been warned that a con
</p>
<p>spiracy was on foot in the West and that Burr was its
</p>
<p>master-spirit. As early as January 10, 1806, Joseph
</p>
<p>H. Daviess, prosecut ing-attorney for the Federal Dis
</p>
<p>trict of Kentucky, wrote the President a private letter
</p>
<p>denouncing the Spanish pensioners, and declaring that
</p>
<p>Burr s object was to effect &quot;a separation of the Union
</p>
<p>in favor of Spain.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;This plot is laid wider than you imagine,&quot; he asserted
</p>
<p>by way of a general warning. &quot; Mention the subject to no
</p>
<p>one from the Western country, however high in office he
</p>
<p>may be. Some of them are deeply tainted with this

<p>treason. I hate duplicity of expression ; but on this

</p>
<p>Daviess knew nothing &quot;explicit,&quot; nor was he in
</p>
<p>better position eleven months later when he swore out
</p>
<p>a process against Burr. Notwithstanding, from the
</p>
<p>date of his first note until Burr was afloat upon the
</p>
<p>Mississippi, he kept up a constant stream of denuncia
</p>
<p>tions. In a second letter, one month from the first, he
</p>
<p>recited the itinerary of Burr during his trip through
</p>
<p>the West in 1805 &amp;gt; named the men with whom he asso
</p>
<p>ciated, dwelling particularly on his connection with
</p>
<p>Wilkinson and the Senator from Ohio. On March 5th
</p>
<p>he declared that he would raise money and pursue the
</p>
<p>plot at his own expense. The President had already
</p>
<p>written him asking for more information. In pursuit
</p>
<p>of this, May 7th found the district-attorney at St.
</p>
<p>Louis, where he remained several days scrutinizing
</p>
<p>Wilkinson s conduct with a view to fathoming the con
</p>
<p>spiracy. 4 Once the General took up a map and, tapping
</p>
<p>the region about New Mexico, said, &quot;Had Burr been
</p>
<p>President we should have had all this country before
</p>
<p>now.&quot; To Madison Daviess confided at this stage that
</p>
<p>a war with Spain was the first step in the programme,
</p>
<p>and that this was considered inevitable. &quot;The Mexican
</p>
<p>provinces, the American possessions on the Mississippi,
</p>
<p>and the Floridas are in view.&quot; Later he saw four

<p>Orleans and the Western States; one for adventurers,
</p>
<p>in the conquest of Mexico; another for the multitude,
</p>
<p>in the Washita lands ; and lastly one for Burr himself,

<p>aggrandizement. 1 But the Government was not driven
</p>
<p>by Daviess s wholesale charges to an investigation of
</p>
<p>the plot; nor were his communications even mentioned
</p>
<p>among the sources of information in the Cabinet Mem
</p>
<p>oranda of October 22d, which Jefferson recorded in his
</p>
<p>own hand.
</p>
<p>&quot;During the last session of Congress, Colonel Burr
</p>
<p>who was here, finding no hope of being employed in any
</p>
<p>department of the government, opened himself confiden
</p>
<p>tially to some persons on whom he thought he could rely,
</p>
<p>on a scheme of separating the Western from the Atlantic
</p>
<p>States, and erecting the former into an independent con
</p>
<p>federacy. He had before made a tour of those States,
</p>
<p>which had excited suspicions, as every motion does of
</p>
<p>such a Catalinarian character. Of his having made this
</p>
<p>proposition here we have information from General
</p>
<p>Eaton through Mr. Ely and Mr. Granger. He went off
</p>
<p>this spring to the western country. Of his movements
</p>
<p>on his way, information has come to the Secretary of
</p>
<p>State and myself from John Nicholson and Mr. Williams
</p>
<p>of the state of New York, respecting a Mr. Tyler;
</p>
<p>Colonel Morgan, Neville, and Roberts, near Pittsburg;
</p>
<p>and to other citizens through other channels and the
</p>

<p>also to order some of the gunboats up to Fort Adams to

<p>general, a question is proposed what is proper to be done
</p>
<p>as to him on this account, as well as for his disobedience
</p>
<p>of orders received by him June 1 1 at St. Louis to descend
</p>
<p>with all practical despatch to New Orleans to mark out
</p>
<p>the site of certain defensive works there, and then repair
</p>
<p>to take command at Natchitoches, on which business he

<p>did not leave St. Louis till September. Consideration

<p>adjourned.
</p>
<p>&quot;October 24. It is agreed unanimously to call for
</p>
<p>Captains Preble and Decatur to repair to New Orleans,
</p>
<p>by land or by sea as they please, there to take command
</p>
<p>of the force on the water, and that the Argus and two

<p>gunboats from New York, three from Norfolk, and two
</p>
<p>from Charleston shall be ordered there, if on consulta
</p>
<p>tion between Mr. Gallatin and Mr. Smith the appropria

<p>tions shall be found to enable us; that Preble shall, on

</p>
<p>&quot;October 25. A mail arrived yesterday from the
</p>
<p>westward, and not one word is heard from that quarter
</p>
<p>of any movements of Colonel Burr. This total silence
</p>
<p>of the officers of the government, of the members of
</p>
<p>Congress, of the newspapers, proves he is committing no
</p>
<p>PLANS AND PREPARATIONS 103
</p>
<p>overt act against the law. We therefore rescind
</p>
<p>the determination to send Preble, Decatur, the Argus, or
</p>
<p>the gunboats, and instead of them to send off the marines
</p>
<p>which are here to reinforce, or take place of, the gar-
</p>
<p>^ rison at New Orleans, with a view to Spanish operations ;
</p>
<p>Ir and instead of writing to the governors, etc., we send
</p>
<p>Graham on that route, with confidential authority to
</p>
<p>inquire into Burr s movements, put the Governors, etc.,
</p>
<p>on their guard, to provide for his arrest if necessary,
</p>
<p>and to take on himself the government of [Upper]
</p>
<p>Louisiana. Letters are still to be written to Claiborne,
</p>
<p>Freeman, and the Governor of Mississippi to be on their
</p>
<p>guard.&quot;
</p>
<p>The resolutions of the first two days indicate that
</p>
<p>the Cabinet saw possible danger in Burr s project; but
</p>
<p>the action of the third proves that they were loath, with
</p>
<p>their meagre information, to take any decisive steps.
</p>
<p>The fact that Wilkinson s derelictions were quietly
</p>
<p>passed over is only another illustration of the painful
</p>
<p>indecision which ruled at this time both President and
</p>
<p>advisers in every matter of importance. Burr s plot
</p>
<p>was subordinated to the threatening foreign complica
</p>
<p>tions; therefore one need express no astonishment at
</p>
<p>the rescinding of all vigorous measures against a con
</p>
<p>spiracy which, as yet, had taken no definite form, and
</p>
<p>which had been denounced only in the vaguest terms.
</p>
<p>It seemed quite sufficient to send John Graham, Secre
</p>
<p>tary of the Orleans Territory, on Burr s path to inquire
</p>
<p>into his behavior, and to write letters of warning to
</p>
<p>the officials of the West.

</p>
<p>The Crisis on the Frontier
</p>
<p>*
</p>
<p>WHEN James Monroe, Minister Plenipoten
</p>
<p>tiary to England and Envoy Extraordinary
</p>
<p>to Spain, quitted Madrid for London, May
</p>
<p>26, 1805, war with Spain appeared inevitable. The at
</p>
<p>tempt to reach a settlement of the disputes between the
</p>
<p>two countries had utterly failed. With the United
</p>
<p>States now threatening to fall upon that part of the
</p>
<p>Empire which might otherwise escape the greed of the
</p>
<p>Dictator of Europe and the English merchants, the
</p>
<p>circle of Spain s enemies was complete; it was a situa
</p>
<p>tion from which there was no escape, and Manuel de
</p>
<p>Godoy, the Prince of Peace, looked resignedly ahead to
</p>
<p>wars and embroilments in the Hope of finding relief.
</p>
<p>The very day on which Monroe had his audience of
</p>
<p>leave with Carlos IV., May 22, 1805, Don Pedro
</p>
<p>Cevallos, Minister of State, discussed with Soler, Min
</p>
<p>ister of Hacienda, the course the negotiations had
</p>
<p>taken. After canvassing each point which had been

<p>raised in the conferences with Monroe admitting the

</p>
<p>negotiations.&quot; 1 The matter was more pointedly put
</p>
<p>by Francisco Gil to the Viceroy of Mexico, Jose de
</p>
<p>Iturrigaray : 2
</p>
<p>&quot;The political situation with regard to the United
</p>
<p>States of America is darkly^ uncertain, because the nego
</p>
<p>tiations which were undertaken with Mr. Monroe have
</p>
<p>been broken off on account of the fact that the claims
</p>
<p>he advanced were as ambitious and exorbitant as they
</p>
<p>were prejudicial to the rights of the Crown. The defenses
</p>
<p>of our possessions will, therefore, be looked to with the
</p>
<p>utmost care.&quot;
</p>
<p>A plan for the protection of Texas was speedily de
</p>
<p>vised, and early in October, 1805, tne posts of Bayou
</p>
<p>Pierre and Nana, to the east of the Sabine recon
</p>
<p>noitring stations mustering respectively forces of
</p>
<p>twenty and ten men were occupied. 3 Behind these
</p>
<p>were Nacogdoches, Orcoquisac, and Trinidad, where
</p>
<p>the real struggle for the defense of the province would
</p>
<p>be made, while further in the interior were La Bahia,
</p>
<p>San Marcos, Refugio, and San Antonio de Bexar. 4
</p>
<p>While these preparations show that a struggle was ex
</p>
<p>pected, half invited, the Americans were taking steps
</p>
<p>which promised no disappointment.
</p>
<p>January 24, 1806, Major Porter, commanding Fort
</p>
<p>Claiborne at Natchitoches, received an order from the
</p>
<p>War Department which required that the officer in
</p>
<p>command at Nacogdoches should give assurance that
</p>
<p>no further inroads would be made to the east of the

<p>Sabine, to which stream the Americans were to extend
</p>
<p>their patrols. Lieutenant Piatt with these instructions
</p>
<p>was sent to Nacogdoches. Rodriguez, the commander,
</p>
<p>replied that no aggression had been intended, but that
</p>
<p>he could not give the assurance demanded. 1 Piatt re
</p>
<p>turned with this answer, and on the first of February
</p>
<p>Captain Turner with his command, which numbered
</p>
<p>sixty, was ordered to proceed to the neighborhood of
</p>
<p>Adayes, where he would fall in with a &quot;stationary party
</p>
<p>of armed Spaniards&quot; which was to be commanded to
</p>
<p>withdraw beyond the Sabine. They might go in peace
</p>
<p>if they would, but evacuate they must, even at the cost
</p>
<p>of blood. So ran the orders. 2
</p>
<p>On the fifth Turner arrived before the camp at
</p>
<p>Bayou Pierre near Adayes, where a mission had stood
</p>
<p>in the past century. Gonzales, the commanding officer,
</p>
<p>protested at the unwarranted invasion of his Sover
</p>
<p>eign s territory, but signed a written agreement to the
</p>
<p>effect that the troops of his Catholic Majesty which he
</p>
<p>commanded would be transported to the other side of
</p>
<p>the Sabine as soon as the horses were in condition to
</p>
<p>travel ; or at furthest in six days. 3
</p>
<p>Now indeed the fear of invasion seized both sides.
</p>
<p>The Americans trembled for Louisiana; the air was
</p>
<p>rife with tales of Spanish intrigues, and there were
</p>
<p>evidences of deceit and treachery. Major Porter had
</p>
<p>but two hundred effective men to meet whatever emer
</p>
<p>gency arose, while the enemy were said to number four

</p>
<p>iards were only fifty-one. But the permanent abandon
</p>
<p>ment of the region in dispute was far from the purpose^
</p>
<p>of Salcedo, Captain -General of the Internal Provinces
</p>
<p>of Mexico, who at once ordered to the front six hun
</p>
<p>dred militia under Lieutenant-Colonel Herrera. 2 A
</p>
<p>little later he declared that the United States by sending
</p>
<p>troops across the Arroyo Hondo had been guilty of
</p>
<p>breaking the harmony existing between the two powers.
</p>
<p>&quot;Ever since France sold Louisiana to -the United
</p>
<p>States,&quot; he went on petulantly to Cordero, 3 nothing has
</p>
<p>been left undone to extend the limits into the Spanish
</p>
<p>possessions of the Missouri (Misuri) and Arkansas
</p>
<p>(Napertle), and to .secure the twenty-two leagues of
</p>
<p>land lying between the Arroyo Hondo and the Sabine,
</p>
<p>the former of which marks the boundary of Louisiana,
</p>
<p>as the Americans well know. They are also massing
</p>
<p>troops without question of expense to hold by force their
</p>
<p>spoils. They are also intriguing with the Indians, have
</p>
<p>built a storehouse at Natchitoches and have filled it with
</p>
<p>gifts for them. It has not been possible for us to oppose
</p>
<p>them in force, but in order to counteract their influence
</p>
<p>among the Indians I have dispatched expeditions to the
</p>
<p>various tribes, our dependencies some to the far North
</p>
<p>west.&quot;
</p>
<p>In addition to the threatening situation in Texas,
</p>
<p>rumors of a graver nature reached the Captain-General
</p>
<p>of the Internal Provinces at Chihuahua. They were
</p>
<p>nothing less than premonitory warnings of the coming
</p>
<p>of Burr; and it is indeed astonishing to discover that
</p>
<p>thus early the officials of Mexico had received ac-

<p>counts of the nature of his plot. Burr s designs were
</p>
<p>complicated with the attitude assumed by the United
</p>
<p>States Government in the matter of the extension of
</p>
<p>boundaries, and the complication confounded contem
</p>
<p>poraries, most of all the Spaniards. They saw the con
</p>
<p>spiracy only as an aggressive movement against their
</p>
<p>territories, organized as it were under the wing of the
</p>
<p>Government and with the plea of vindication of rights.
</p>
<p>But the Spaniards also thought they had rights, and
</p>
<p>prepared to defend them. April 2ist Governor Cordero
</p>
<p>commanded that the various chiefs of Indian tribes
</p>
<p>of Texas should be notified of the menace of the United
</p>
<p>States, so that they might be vigilant. 1 By this, too,
</p>
<p>the Viceroy, who was at first inclined to ignore the
</p>
<p>movement, began to look seriously upon the crisis, and
</p>
<p>sent forward all the available troops. 2
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Spanish soldiers who had lingered
</p>
<p>in New Orleans months beyond their allotted time for
</p>
<p>no other purpose, some thought, than to create disaffec
</p>
<p>tion, or to be on the ground to seize the city by a coup
</p>
<p>de main were ordered away. Among those who left
</p>
<p>sullen and defeated was the dictatorial intendant, Juan
</p>
<p>Ventura Morales, famous as the author of the closure
</p>
<p>of the entrepot at New Orleans. February I5th, three
</p>
<p>days after Morales had departed, Marquis Casa Calvo,
</p>
<p>also under compulsion and bitterly protesting, set out
</p>
<p>for Pensacola. He had just returned to New Orleans

<p>from a four months trip to Texas, where, to credit

<p>tilities in the belief that Louisiana would espouse the
</p>
<p>cause of Spain. 1 Cordero and Salcedo thought him
</p>
<p>busy with carrying into effect his commission as terri
</p>
<p>torial adjudicator, while Claiborne heard that he was
</p>
<p>tampering with the allegiance of the Indians ; that he
</p>
<p>was spreading discontent, or indeed, that he had gone
</p>
<p>to command the Mexican army. 2 The nervous Gov
</p>
<p>ernor of Louisiana rejoiced therefore at the President s
</p>
<p>determination to hasten the withdrawal of the Span
</p>
<p>iards. Their expulsion, however, stirred up their
</p>
<p>brethren in West Florida. Governor Folch refused
</p>
<p>to permit the transmission of the United States mails
</p>
<p>through his territory, the fortifications of Mobile were
</p>
<p>strengthened, and emissaries were sent among the
</p>
<p>Choctaws. Claiborne became uneasy, and wrote the
</p>
<p>President that a respectable force was essential to the
</p>
<p>safety of New Orleans. As the summer wore on
</p>
<p>affairs calmed somewhat on the frontier, but there
</p>
<p>were too many provocations for the thought of peace.
</p>
<p>Spain had cast the die and was as determined to
</p>
<p>do nothing her European position had materially
</p>
<p>changed for the worse as when Monroe demanded

<p>his passports of Carlos IV. in May, 1805.
</p>
<p>&quot;On the fourth of July [1806],&quot; says ParloiU
</p>
<p>&quot;there were not a thousand persons in the United

</p>
<p>that this feeling reached its climax, and the sentiments
</p>
<p>pervading the celebrations of the Fourth of July may
</p>
<p>well be taken as indicative of their attitude. To know
</p>
<p>their attitude to\yard the Union, a war with Spain, the
</p>
<p>invasion of Mexico is to hold the key to the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>From the nature of things, a conspiracy with form and
</p>
<p>life .must reflect the character of its adherents. Was
</p>
<p>there then in the West an element unfriendly to the
</p>
<p>Union ? Was there one animated by revolutionary im
</p>
<p>pulses which longed to expel the arrogant foreigner
</p>
<p>from the shores of America? The Westerners made
</p>
<p>reply in unequivocal language.
</p>
<p>At a banquet in Cincinnati the following appro
</p>
<p>priate toast was drunk : &quot;May party spirit be banished
</p>
<p>from this land, and freedom and a union of sentiment
</p>
<p>predominate; a determination to support our liberty
</p>
<p>and Constitution inviolate.&quot; * Among other toasts
</p>
<p>offered at Georgetown, Kentucky, were: &quot;The people
</p>
<p>of the United States : may their union be lasting as
</p>
<p>time&quot;; and, &quot;Western America: one in principle and
</p>
<p>interest with the rest of the Union.&quot; 2 In a neighbor
</p>
<p>ing city: &quot;The Mississippi and its waters our high
</p>
<p>way to market : may its trade be free and uninterrupted
</p>
<p>as its current.&quot; Then drinking to Louisiana, our recent
</p>
<p>acquisition: &quot;May the tree of liberty flourish on the
</p>
<p>ruins of despotism&quot;; and, &quot;May the Western country
</p>
<p>flourish, and the golden chain of the Union never
</p>
<p>break.&quot; 3 At Lexington they praised &quot;l\e patriots who
</p>
<p>suffered in 76&quot; ; and, &quot;Thomas Jefferson, President of

<p>sions of faith and confidence in the Constitution and

<p>the Republic. At a celebration given October 25th in
</p>
<p>honor of Lewis and Clark, the returning explorers of
</p>
<p>the far Northwest, these toasts were proposed: &quot;The

<p>Territory of Louisiana freedom without bloodshed :
</p>
<p>may her actions duly appreciate the blessing.&quot; Then,
</p>
<p>with three cheers : &quot;The Federal Constitution : may

<p>the eagle of America convey it to the remotest parts
</p>
<p>of the globe ; and whilst they read they can but admire.&quot;
</p>
<p>A third : &quot;The memory of the illustrious Washington,

<p>father of America : may his guardian spirit still watch

<p>In New Orleans they toasted the following sentiment :

<p>destruction of the power which had fettered it. Also
</p>
<p>the Mexican Association, or, more accurately, the
</p>
<p>Mexican Society, of New Orleans was enthusiastic
</p>
<p>in the agitation for war. &quot;It had for its object,&quot; said
</p>
<p>Dr. Watkins, Mayor of New Orleans, &quot;collecting in
</p>
<p>formation relative to the population and force of the
</p>
<p>interior provinces of New Spain which, in the event
</p>
<p>of war, might be useful to the United States.&quot; He
</p>
<p>further averred that the invasion of Mexico had always
</p>
<p>been counted upon in a war with the Dons.
</p>
<p>The West, as it loved the Union hated Spain, and
</p>
<p>that hatred appeared to be of a nature which only war
</p>
<p>could appease. The war might be legitimate or other
</p>
<p>wise there were those who did not mean to ask ques

<p>tions. Perhaps this element and its most extravagant
</p>
<p>plan is represented in the communication published in
</p>
<p>several Western newspapers in the fall of 1805, over
</p>
<p>the signature of &quot;A Kentucky Man&quot; :

<p>&quot;As to the Spaniards, we can pay ourselves. There
</p>
<p>are gentlemen now in this city from the westward, who
</p>
<p>will make contracts whenever Congress authorizes it to
</p>
<p>pay every just claim of our citizens upon them, and will
</p>
<p>engage to do it, free of any expense to the United States,
</p>
<p>and also, not to injure any private property in Mexico.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>Evidently nothing less was meditated than the
</p>
<p>overrunning of Mexico, whose public domains or con

<p>fiscated public properties would be seized for debts

<p>long overdue! The proposition was not so visionary

</p>
<p>ii4 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>in casting up the sum total of ideas which were eddy
</p>
<p>ing in the West.
</p>
<p>In the midst of the war excitement, in the winter
</p>
<p>of 1805, Francisco de Miranda, a native of Caracas,
</p>
<p>landed in New York. As early as 1793 he had tried
</p>
<p>to draw the United States and Great Britain into a
</p>
<p>war for the liberation of his native country. Failing
</p>
<p>then, he went to the Continent, where he became a
</p>
<p>distinguished wanderer, taking high rank in the armies
</p>
<p>of both France and Russia. It was truly an auspicious
</p>
<p>time for him to revive his scheme of rebellion in Vene
</p>
<p>zuela, for war between Spain and the United States
</p>
<p>appeared to be only a matter of days. Finding gener
</p>
<p>ous friends in New York, he soon had the Leander
</p>
<p>fitted out with arms and provisions, and February 2,
</p>
<p>1806, sailed on his ill-fated voyage.
</p>
<p>The part played by the Government in this affair
</p>
<p>is, to say the least, not above suspicion, for both Jeffer
</p>
<p>son and Madison knew something of what was going
</p>
<p>on ; but for us what is of most value in this connection
</p>
<p>is to know that the expedition was watched with the
</p>
<p>greatest interest throughout the Union, especially in
</p>
<p>the West. The newspapers of the time were full of
</p>
<p>Miranda, and the tone of the comment was most con
</p>
<p>vincing. A single paragraph from the Charleston
</p>
<p>Courier, quoted in the Orleans Gazette, will suffice i 1
</p>
<p>&quot;The expedition under General Miranda, from a va
</p>
<p>riety of circumstances, promises to be attended with suc
</p>
<p>cess. The dissatisfaction of the people generally with the
</p>
<p>Spanish Government, and particularly the priests, who,

<p>THE CRISIS ON THE FRONTIER 115
</p>
<p>by a late decree of the court of Madrid, are deprived of
</p>
<p>the principal parts of the revenues of the church, will
</p>
<p>induce them to seek a change of masters ; to rid them
</p>
<p>selves at once of the most abject state of slavery and ig
</p>
<p>norance and from the fiend-like influence of the Prince
</p>
<p>of Peace. . . . What has the Spanish Government to
</p>
<p>oppose him [Miranda] ? Nothing. The provinces are
</p>
<p>without troops, or at least they are not sufficient to drive
</p>
<p>the revolters from their purposes. The mother country
</p>
<p>cannot assist them she has soldiers but no ships and
</p>
<p>if the means of transportation were found, the British
</p>
<p>fleet would intercept them. . . . The success of Mi
</p>
<p>randa will open to the Americans a new field of enter
</p>
<p>prise ; from the United States they must receive their sup
</p>
<p>plies of goods and military stores, and the products which
</p>
<p>can be obtained in return will yield a good profit. . . .
</p>
<p>But, we hope, remembering our own emancipation, we
</p>
<p>shall give our aid to those who feel their rights, and
</p>
<p>have courage enough to assert them. . . . May the
</p>
<p>most brilliant success attend the standards of those who
</p>
<p>fight for the cause of rational liberty, and for the dignity
</p>
<p>of the human species.&quot;
</p>
<p>Such paragraphs need no discussion, but the fact
</p>
<p>that they were printed and reprinted in every journal
</p>
<p>of the West is worth remarking. Having been thus
</p>
<p>informed of Miranda s enterprise, the Westerners were /
</p>
<p>on the alert for any news from Venezuela. All through T
</p>
<p>the summer and fall that Burr and his associates were
</p>
<p>struggling to make headway with their expedition the
</p>
<p>newspapers were telling of Miranda s victories, and
</p>
<p>finally of the rumors of his defeat. When the report
</p>
<p>came that he had been beaten off, the West was loath
</p>
<p>to give credence to it, and the disappointment was keen

</p>
<p>when it came positively to be known that he had failed.
</p>
<p>There was not in all the West a word of disaffection.
</p>
<p>n6 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>In their toasts and toasts were of far greater signifi
</p>
<p>cance in that day than this two ideas appear predomi
</p>
<p>nant: reverence for the Union and hatred for the
</p>
<p>symbols of despotism. Their sympathies, too, for
</p>
<p>Miranda betrayed unconsciously a love for the Con
</p>
<p>stitution and a growing National spirit which was in
</p>
<p>six short years to force, in spite of the East and New
</p>
<p>England, the second war with Great Britain ! And
</p>
<p>yet this was the region advertised as openly rebellious
</p>
<p>the region Yrujo and Merry expected shortly to
</p>
<p>declare its independence. Could ignorance of condi
</p>
<p>tions have been more dense?
</p>
<p>By the end of June, 1806, there were in the province
</p>
<p>of Texas one thousand and seven soldiers. 1 The force
</p>
<p>on the frontier, however, never exceeded six hundred
</p>
<p>and ninety-seven men, 2 which was considered strong
</p>
<p>enough to sustain the King s pretensions in that quar
</p>
<p>ter. Accordingly, in July, a body of troops under
</p>
<p>Viana once more hoisted the flag of Spain at Bayou
</p>
<p>Pierre. August 4th Viana wrote urgently to the com
</p>
<p>mander of Nacogdoches for provisions, complaining
</p>
<p>that they had been four days without rations. 3 The
</p>
<p>straits of the quartermaster were much intensified
</p>
<p>by the arrival of Herrera with several companies of
</p>
<p>cavalry; while sickness spread through the camp, con
</p>
<p>verting it into a wretched hospital. But the Ameri
</p>
<p>cans held exaggerated ideas of the efficiency of the
</p>
<p>corps under Cordero and Herrera.

<p>THE CRISIS ON THE FRONTIER 117
</p>
<p>The news of the recrossing of the Sabine by the
</p>
<p>Spaniards spread rapidly through the country, rousing
</p>
<p>the inhabitants to arms for the hated enemy appeared
</p>
<p>once more as invaders. The Governor of Louisiana
</p>
<p>was at Concordia, near Natchez having been granted
</p>
<p>a leave of absence to visit his home in Tennessee when
</p>
<p>the intelligence reached him. August I7th he met
</p>
<p>Cowles Meade, the Acting-Governor of Mississippi
</p>
<p>Territory, at Natchez, and a joint proclamation was
</p>
<p>issued. The people were called upon to aid the regular
</p>
<p>troops in expelling the Spaniards from Bayou Pierre,
</p>
<p>if the orders of the War Department had not been
</p>
<p>revoked; they were to be put on a campaign footing,
</p>
<p>the militia of the Mississippi Territory being ready to
</p>
<p>march to the frontier or to defend New Orleans, as the
</p>
<p>circumstances might require. The continued absence
</p>
<p>of Wilkinson was remarked and regretted. 1 But Clai-
</p>
<p>borne felt he had no time to lose. &quot;Having heard that
</p>
<p>a considerable force of Spaniards [is] in the vicinity of
</p>
<p>Natchitoches,&quot; he wrote the same day to Dr. John
</p>
<p>Watkins, 2 &quot;I propose setting out to-morrow for the
</p>
<p>counties of Rapides and Natchitoches, for the purpose
</p>
<p>of putting the militia in the best possible state.&quot;
</p>
<p>Before Claiborne had started, a Pinckneyville cor
</p>
<p>respondent of the Orleans Gazette reported that Lieu
</p>
<p>tenant Smith had arrived from Natchitoches with
</p>
<p>orders for Colonel Kingsbury to march forward with
</p>
<p>all the troops at Fort Adams. Nine hundred men
</p>
<p>under the Governor of Texas, so the report ran, had

</p>
<p>advanced to within twelve miles of Natchitoches, where
</p>
<p>they were met by a flag from Major Porter, demanding
</p>
<p>an explanation of this new encroachment; to which
</p>
<p>they answered that they meant to reoccupy their for
</p>
<p>mer positions. An engagement had therefore probably
</p>
<p>taken place, if the Spaniards persisted in their under
</p>
<p>taking. 1 The reporter was not aware, however, that
</p>
<p>: the commander at Natchitoches was bound by supple
</p>
<p>mentary instructions from the head of the army, which
</p>
<p>forbade the enforcement of the orders from the Secre
</p>
<p>tary of War. Wilkinson was already disposing of
</p>
<p>things to suit himself.
</p>
<p>Claiborne entered at once into a sharp controversy
</p>
<p>with Herrera. On the twenty-sixth he complained of
</p>
<p>several acts of unfriendliness the setting at liberty of
</p>
<p>runaway slaves, the capture of three Americans (Irwin,
</p>
<p>Shaw, and Brewster), and the invasion of the territory
</p>
<p>of the United States. Herrera did not deny the first
</p>
<p>two charges, but returned his demurrer to the third.
</p>
<p>At this juncture he fell ill, and Claiborne courteously
</p>
<p>sent Dr. Hayward to attend him. The Governor, how
</p>
<p>ever, did not mean to suspend operations he urged
</p>
<p>the fulfillment of the instructions from Washington,
</p>
<p>which commanded that all foreign troops should be
</p>
<p>driven to the west of the Sabine. Colonel Cushing
</p>
<p>explained that this would be contrary to the mandate
</p>
<p>of Wilkinson ; and thereupon the Governor gave vent
</p>
<p>to his suspicions in a letter to Meade : &quot;My present
</p>
<p>impression is that all is not right/ I know not whom
</p>
<p>to censure, but it seems to me that there is wrong

</p>
<p>have been published) ought not to have been issued,
</p>
<p>or they should have been adhered to and supported.&quot; *
</p>
<p>It was, indeed, hard for a layman to understand how
</p>
<p>even a general could set in abeyance the commands
</p>
<p>of his superior ; there was wrong somewhere, but this
</p>
<p>was as near as the good-natured, honest Governor ever
</p>
<p>came to its discovery. The day he wrote Meade he
</p>
<p>addressed two letters quite free from suspicions to the
</p>
<p>War Department:
</p>
<p>&quot;The Spanish troops have made a retrograde move
</p>
<p>ment,&quot; he reported August 28th; 2 &quot;they have advanced
</p>
<p>their main body to within seventeen miles of Natchi-
</p>
<p>toches, and their patrols as far as the Bayou Funda [Ar
</p>
<p>royo Hondo], to which place it is contended the province
</p>
<p>of Texas extends (this bayou is about seven miles from
</p>
<p>Natchitoches) ; but within these few days past they have
</p>
<p>fallen back to the settlement of Bayou Pierre, about fifty
</p>
<p>or sixty miles distant from Natchitoches. Their num
</p>
<p>bers are conjectured to be 1,000, the greater part cavalry,
</p>
<p>and reinforcements are daily expected. They are amply
</p>
<p>supplied with beef cattle, but it is said a scarcity of bread
</p>
<p>is experienced. ... I have found the Americans, who
</p>
<p>are settled in the frontier counties, devoted to their
</p>
<p>country, and solicitous to be called into service.&quot;
</p>
<p>The second letter, a week later, recounted as current
</p>
<p>report that the Spaniards at Bayou Pierre numbered
</p>
<p>1200; that the Governor of Texas was approaching
</p>
<p>with three hundred regulars ; that two regiments from

<p>of Spain having no part in it. It was mentioned that
</p>
<p>Colonel Cushing was restrained from acting on the
</p>
<p>offensive by Wilkinson s commands; that the Colonel
</p>
<p>in the meantime was making arrangements to take the
</p>
<p>field, while he (Claiborne) was preparing the militia. 1
</p>
<p>After his experiences in the administration of the
</p>
<p>municipality of New Orleans, where he found only
</p>
<p>antagonisms and imbittered factions, political and
</p>
<p>social, it gave him extreme pleasure, as he wrote Cush
</p>
<p>ing, to note the enthusiasm of the people. 2 The una
</p>
<p>nimity with which they responded to the defense of the
</p>
<p>country was certainly gratifying to him and to those
</p>
<p>in the high places of the Government, who were in daily
</p>
<p>expectation of the herald of war.
</p>
<p>The Cabinet early resigned itself to the situation.
</p>
<p>When the news of the expulsion of Gonzales reached
</p>
<p>Washington a meeting was held, the result of which
</p>
<p>the President reported to Dearborn, who was absent :
</p>
<p>&quot;Six war vessels are to be kept before New Orleans,&quot;
</p>
<p>ran the note ; &quot;three in Lake Pontchartrain. Blockhouses
</p>
<p>and other defenses are to be erected at suitable places on
</p>
<p>the defiles of New Orleans. The troops are to remain
</p>
<p>off the island on account of their health, but they are to
</p>
<p>be ready to march at notice. The militia of New Orleans,
</p>
<p>Tombigbee, and Natchez are to be put in the best pos
</p>
<p>sible condition; those at New Orleans to defend that
</p>
<p>city; those on the Tombigbee to seize Mobile or Pensa-
</p>
<p>cola, or follow if the Spanish troops from either of these
</p>
<p>threaten New Orleans. These orders are to be carried

<p>out with as little noise as possible.&quot; 5

<p>THE CRISIS ON THE FRONTIER 121
</p>
<p>state of mind of the Government is clearly reflected
</p>
<p>therein. If anything was left in doubt, this was shortly
</p>
<p>removed by the Executive. May 6, 1806, when the fol
</p>
<p>lowing orders went forward to General Wilkinson, the
</p>
<p>challenge was accepted, and it was for the administra
</p>
<p>tors of Don Carlos in the New World to say whether
</p>
<p>the Floridas, Louisiana, Texas, and the Spanish
</p>
<p>Americas should become legitimate stakes of war.
</p>
<p>&quot;From recent information received from New Orleans
</p>
<p>and its vicinity,&quot; wrote the Secretary of War to General
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, 1 &quot;the hostile views of the officers of his Cath
</p>
<p>olic Majesty in that quarter have been so evident as to
</p>
<p>require the strictest precaution on the part of the United
</p>
<p>States ; and the immediate exertion of the means we pos
</p>
<p>sess for securing the rightful possession of the territory
</p>
<p>of the United States, and for protecting the citizens and
</p>
<p>their property from the hostile encroachments of our
</p>
<p>neighbours, the Spaniards. You will, therefore, with as
</p>
<p>little delay as practicable, repair to the Territory of Or-
</p>
<p>1 ans or its vicinity, and take upon yourself the command
</p>
<p>of the troops in that quarter, together with such militia or
</p>
<p>volunteers as may turn out for the defense of the country.
</p>
<p>And you will, by all the means in your power, repel any
</p>
<p>invasion of the territory of the United States east of the
</p>
<p>River Sabine, or north or west of the bounds of what
</p>
<p>has been called West Florida.&quot;
</p>
<p>There could be no mistaking the meaning of these
</p>
<p>orders; they were explicit and final. Though it was
</p>
<p>true &quot;every day increased our prospects of war,&quot; as the
</p>
<p>General wrote, he was detained in St. Louis for three
</p>
<p>months by &quot;various and unavoidable obstacles.&quot; What
</p>
<p>these distressing impediments were we are left to sur
</p>

<p>himself on the one side and Major Bruff and Colonel
</p>
<p>Hammond on the other offers no explanation. 1 He
</p>
<p>wrote John Smith very soon after the receipt of the
</p>
<p>dispatch of May 6th : &quot;I shall obey the military man
</p>
<p>date, for there I look for fame and honor.&quot; 3 He was
</p>
<p>therefore apparently eager to proceed. Why the delay ?
</p>
<p>Is it not possible that Clark gave us the key when he
</p>
<p>said that the General wrote Burr, &quot;I shall be ready
</p>
<p>before you&quot; ? His procrastination was deliberate, and
</p>
<p>could have been for no other purpose than to await the
</p>
<p>development of the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Wilkinson landed in Natchez the night of Sep
</p>
<p>tember 7th, and the next day outlined his programme
</p>
<p>to Dearborn : &quot;I shall drain the cup of conciliation to
</p>
<p>maintain the peace of our country,&quot; he vaunted ; but in
</p>
<p>the preceding paragraph he had remarked that he hoped
</p>
<p>the Spaniards would remain at Bayou Pierre until he
</p>
<p>arrived, and he had taken occasion to say that both
</p>
<p>Meade and Claiborne favored expelling the enemy alto

<p>up, I shall endeavor to procure about four or five hun
</p>
<p>dred dragoons and mounted militia from the two terri
</p>
<p>tories. ... A blow once struck, it would appear
</p>
<p>expedient that we should make every advantage of it ; and
</p>
<p>if men and means are furnished I will soon plant our
</p>
<p>standards on the left bank of Grand River.&quot;
</p>
<p>The &quot;designs of the Spaniard&quot; must have been
</p>
<p>seen at a glance, for at no moment was the march
</p>
<p>of the militia discouraged. Moreover, to have spoken
</p>
<p>of designs was deliberate and calculated to work on the
</p>
<p>fears of the Government; he had assumed the extraor
</p>
<p>dinary role he was to play to the end. While inditing
</p>
<p>this to Dearborn he was making arrangements with
</p>
<p>Governor Meade for the volunteers of Mississippi Ter
</p>
<p>ritory to join him, and giving orders for the strength
</p>
<p>ening of various posts. Pointe Coupee was to be re-
</p>
<p>enforced with seventy-five men, which number, with a
</p>
<p>detachment of militia, he thought sufficient to capture
</p>
<p>the Spanish Governor, Grand Pre, with his garrison in
</p>
<p>Baton Rouge. Two hundred militia were to be added
</p>
<p>to the force on the Tombigbee, and the commander was
</p>
<p>to be ready to invest Mobile, while another body was
</p>
<p>to make a feint on Pensacola to prevent reinforcements
</p>
<p>being sent to the former. These instructions given,
</p>
<p>Wilkinson started for the front via Rapides on the Red
</p>
<p>River, at which place Claiborne awaited him. On the
</p>
<p>nineteenth the General appeared. He then addressed
</p>
<p>the Governor, discussing the menacing attitude of
</p>
<p>Spain, and advising the issuance of a proclamation
</p>
<p>interdicting intercourse between the contending parties,
</p>
<p>save as regulated under passports. He argued that this

</p>
<p>was warranted because of the vigorous policy pursued
</p>
<p>i2 4 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>by the enemy in permitting no one to pass to Nacog-
</p>
<p>doches unless known to be attached to Spain. Through
</p>
<p>this system of intercourse they were advised of all our
</p>
<p>plans, while we remained ignorant of theirs. Next he
</p>
<p>asked for the troops in New Orleans and every militia
</p>
<p>man to be spared, and he wanted them to assemble at
</p>
<p>Natchitoches early in October. 1 Claiborne replied the
</p>
<p>same day that he could not issue the proclamation for
</p>
<p>fear of retaliatory measures being pursued by West
</p>
<p>Florida ; the same effect, he thought, might be produced
</p>
<p>by prohibiting communications through Natchitoches,
</p>
<p>the only open route. Wilkinson could close this by
</p>
<p>issuing an order to prevent the passage of provisions
</p>
<p>to the Spaniards. As to the militia, the Governor
</p>
<p>promised a force of four hundred ; the rest, because of
</p>
<p>the nature of the country to be defended, were to be
</p>
<p>reserved for emergencies. 2 Claiborne s steps had been
</p>
<p>taken with a view to war, and he urged upon the Gen
</p>
<p>eral that &quot;no time ought to be lost in preparing to vin
</p>
<p>dicate the national rights.&quot;
</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the rural districts thought like
</p>
<p>wise. They came with such alacrity that in one in
</p>
<p>stance a call for one hundred volunteers was answered
</p>
<p>by two hundred and fifteen. October 3d was the day
</p>
<p>appointed for the general rendezvous at Natchitoches,
</p>
<p>the headquarters of the American army, which place
</p>
<p>Wilkinson reached September 22d, two weeks having

<p>chafing under delay and were eager to drive back the
</p>
<p>Dons, the commander of the army was still moving
</p>
<p>leisurely. The day Wilkinson left Rapides the Gov
</p>
<p>ernor started for New Orleans, and the evening of
</p>
<p>October 6th reentered his capital, where things were in
</p>
<p>a stir of excitement. The news that war was im
</p>
<p>pending was hailed with enthusiasm. The Orleans
</p>
<p>Gazette, the leading journal of the city and the mouth
</p>
<p>piece of the Americans, came out in a long article,
</p>
<p>which, after having announced that General Wilkinson
</p>
<p>had gone to the frontier, gave vent to pure revolu
</p>
<p>tionary sentiment :
</p>
<p>&quot;We are happy to learn that the Government has at
</p>
<p>length issued positive orders to repel the aggressions of
</p>
<p>our enemies by force. We have indeed suffered from
</p>
<p>them, almost beyond human endurance. Their intrigues
</p>
<p>to disturb the repose of this country; their maintaining
</p>
<p>possession of our territory between the Mississippi and
</p>
<p>Perdido for upwards of two years ; their outrageous con
</p>
<p>duct towards our citizens on the banks of the Tombig-
</p>
<p>bee ; these and a thousand other injuries and insults de
</p>
<p>mand instant redress. ... If the enemy be forced to re-
</p>
<p>cross the Sabine, he must be driven still farther; for it
</p>
<p>would be idle to suffer him to remain there quietly until he
</p>
<p>received reinforcements from the Southern provinces,
</p>
<p>which could easily be furnished him, inasmuch as the route
</p>
<p>from Natchitoches to Mexico is clear, plain, and open ; and
</p>
<p>the country through which it passes well stored with cattle
</p>
<p>and forage. How it may be proper to pursue the enemy
</p>
<p>is a question of policy for our Government to decide. On
</p>
<p>this we may sincerely rely that our President, who had
</p>
<p>so large a share in accomplishing the independence of the
</p>
<p>United States, will seize with eagerness and exultation

<p>. . . Gallant Louisianians ! now is the time to distin
</p>
<p>guish yourselves. . . . Should the generous efforts
</p>
<p>of our Government to establish a free, independent repub
</p>
<p>lican empire in Mexico be successful, how fortunate, how
</p>
<p>enviable would be the situation in New Orleans! The
</p>
<p>deposit at once of the countless treasures of the South, and
</p>
<p>the inexhaustible fertility of the Western States, we
</p>
<p>would soon rival and outshine the most opulent cities of
</p>
<p>the world.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>This language seems none the less remarkable when
</p>
<p>we know that it came from the pen of Editor Bradford,
</p>
<p>who, a few weeks later, was throttled by Wilkinson on
</p>
<p>a charge of misprision of treason against the United
</p>
<p>States. He was a coadjutor of Burr, to whose enter
</p>
<p>prise he doubtless referred when he wrote that the

<p>President would seize with eagerness and exultation an
</p>
<p>honorable occasion &quot;for conferring on our oppressed
</p>
<p>Spanish brethren in Mexico those inestimable blessings

<p>truly exhibits the underlying motives in all great
</p>
<p>revolutionary movements the vindication of rights,
</p>
<p>the freeing of oppressed peoples, and finally the mate

<p>rial reward. If war with Spain was avoided for almost
</p>
<p>a century, it was not for lack of moral support that it
</p>
<p>failed in 1806; nor does this admission do justice to
</p>
<p>the revolutionary audience that applauded the senti
</p>
<p>ments uttered by the Orleans Gazette, nor to the men
</p>
<p>who hurried to arms at the call of danger.

</p>
<p>marched under Captain Sparks for Natchitoches.
</p>
<p>Major Ferdinand L. Claiborne was expected to pass
</p>
<p>toward the frontier at any hour at the head of the
</p>
<p>Mississippi militia and Captain Farrar s dragoons. 1
</p>
<p>October 8th Claiborne informed the Secretary of War
</p>
<p>that the militia from the frontier counties, more than
</p>
<p>five hundred strong, had reported at Natchitoches, and
</p>
<p>that a detachment of one hundred regulars with mili
</p>
<p>tary stores would set out in a few days from New
</p>
<p>Orleans. 2 Thus the American Army in the West
</p>
<p>rapidly concentrated at the old French trading post.
</p>
<p>The temper of the volunteers was no longer questioned.
</p>
<p>Claiborne wrote Dearborn on the twelfth that he was
</p>
<p>surprised at the readiness with which the ancient Lou-
</p>
<p>isianians took up arms. He conveyed also the intelli
</p>
<p>gence that Wilkinson had written in his last letter
</p>
<p>(dated September 25th) that unless his orders were
</p>
<p>countermanded he &quot;would soon have a meeting with
</p>
<p>the Spaniards.&quot; 3 It looked as though the fate of the
</p>
<p>nation as to peace or war hung on Wilkinson s word.
</p>
<p>This was the war which was to have called Burr s
</p>
<p>expedition into open array. Senator Adair avowed
</p>
<p>that &quot;on this war taking place he [Burr] calculated
</p>
<p>with certainty, as well from the policy of the measure
</p>
<p>at the time, as from the positive assurances of Wilkin
</p>
<p>son, who seemed to have the power to force it in his
</p>
<p>hands.&quot; 4 Wilkinson had gone further in his confidence
</p>
<p>with Adair, and, after the failure of the conspiracy,

</p>
<p>attempted to disparage his character, accusing the Ken-
</p>
<p>tuckian of having gone to New Orleans in the fall of
</p>
<p>1806 in the &quot;dark.&quot; 1 Adair retaliated, quoting from
</p>
<p>the General s letters. In answer to a question in Adair s
</p>
<p>correspondence of January 2/th &quot;Pray how far is it,
</p>
<p>and what kind of way from St. Louis to Santa Fe, and
</p>
<p>from thence to Mexico?&quot; 2 Wilkinson wrote:
</p>
<p>&quot;Do you know that I have reserved these places for
</p>
<p>my own triumphal entry, that I have been reconnoitering
</p>
<p>and exploring the route for sixteen years ; that I not only
</p>
<p>know the way, but all the difficulties and how to surmount
</p>
<p>them? I wish we could get leave, Mexico would soon
</p>
<p>be ours.&quot;
</p>
<p>More significant is his letter of September 28th
</p>
<p>from Natchitoches, in which Adair was assured that
</p>
<p>within six or eight days the sword would be drawn :
</p>
<p>&quot;The time long looked for by many and wished for
</p>
<p>by more, has now arrived for subverting the Spanish
</p>
<p>government in Mexico. Be you ready and join me ; we
</p>
<p>will want little more than light-armed troops with a few
</p>
<p>More will be done by marching than fighting;
</p>
<p>5,000 men will give us to Rio ; 10,000 to ;
</p>
<p>we must here divide our army into three parts and will
</p>
<p>then require 30,000 men to conquer the whole of the prov
</p>
<p>inces of Mexico. We cannot fail of success.&quot; 8

<p>Adair challenged the President to look into Wilkin

<p>THE CRISIS ON THE FRONTIER 129
</p>
<p>seems to think it an unpardonable offense to meditate
</p>
<p>an expedition against the government, or rather the
</p>
<p>tyranny of Spain, by a citizen of the United States
</p>
<p>prior to a declaration of war. Let him then prosecute
</p>
<p>Wilkinson.&quot;
</p>
<p>What character the war was to have assumed it is
</p>
<p>impossible to say; but war in some form was thought
</p>
<p>by Wilkinson to be certain. His letter to Adair had
</p>
<p>been preceded by one written from Rapides, September
</p>
<p>1 8th, to a gentleman in Cincinnati, in which he graph
</p>
<p>ically pointed out the situation i 1
</p>
<p>&quot;My orders and the conduct of the Mexicans are so
</p>
<p>much at variance, and the Spanish commander at the
</p>
<p>head of fifteen or eighteen hundred men, has treated the
</p>
<p>strong remonstrances of Governor Claiborne and Colonel
</p>
<p>Cushing with such slight, after having traversed the ter
</p>
<p>ritory east of the Sabine, where he has taken his nearest
</p>
<p>post, and menaced our establishment at Natchitoches, that
</p>
<p>I foresee an inevitable appeal to arms in the course of
</p>
<p>twelve days, if the Spaniards should not recede or I receive
</p>
<p>counter orders. And as Governor Herrera is an officer
</p>
<p>who has risen by his sword, and is reputed a man of great
</p>
<p>pride and spirit, I think it probable he will adhere to his
</p>
<p>solemn promise to maintain and defend his master s ter
</p>
<p>ritorial pretensions to a point within seven miles of our
</p>
<p>post, and fifty east of the Sabine. Under these circum
</p>
<p>stances, but with a solemn determination to drain the cup
</p>
<p>of conciliation before I draw the sword, I have called for
</p>
<p>about seven hundred militia, which is the sum total I
</p>
<p>am to expect from this Territory and the Mississippi Ter
</p>
<p>ritory, to be assembled at Natchitoches the fifth prox.
</p>
<p>It is not improbable hostilities at this point will be in
</p>
<p>stantly followed by an appeal to arms in West Florida.

<p>ish Governors opposed to me, Herrera and Cordero, of
</p>
<p>whom and their two thousand men, I shall with less than
</p>
<p>twelve hundred give a good account.&quot;
</p>
<p>In spite of exaggerations concerning the strength
</p>
<p>of the enemy, Wilkinson had grasped the essentials of
</p>
<p>the situation. War could be circumvented in two ways
</p>
<p>by the withdrawal of the Spaniards, or by modified
</p>
<p>orders from the Executive. The latter exigency, how
</p>
<p>ever, was not to be anticipated ; but already the possible
</p>
<p>contingency of the former appealed to him. He feared
</p>
<p>for his plans, but took courage, knowing that Herrera,
</p>
<p>a man of &quot;pride and spirit/ had vowed to maintain his
</p>
<p>Majesty s territorial pretensions. Nevertheless, Wil
</p>
<p>kinson was far too cunning to be found at the end
</p>
<p>of his resources. His career of double-dealing in Ken
</p>
<p>tucky where, at the same moment, he had flattered
</p>
<p>Miro with the prospect of drawing the West into the
</p>
<p>Spanish net and indited a pleasant petition to Congress
</p>
<p>was destined to be far eclipsed. And he was not long
</p>
<p>in giving evidence of his disposition. He wrote at
</p>
<p>length to Senator Smith :
</p>
<p>&quot;I have made the last effort at conciliation in a solemn
</p>
<p>appeal to Governor Cordero, at Nacogdoches, who is in
</p>
<p>command on this frontier; Colonel Cushing bore my
</p>
<p>letter and is now with the don. I expect his return in
</p>
<p>four days, and then I believe, my friend, I believe I shall
</p>
<p>be obliged to fight and to flog them, for I shall advance
</p>
<p>into the contested tract the moment I have provided
</p>
<p>horses for four light pieces of artillery, our camp equi
</p>
<p>pages, and a little provision. The orders of the Spaniards
</p>
<p>are, I know, peremptory to maintain the jurisdiction of
</p>
<p>the grounds to the sovereign ; of consequence, they must

</p>
<p>them over the Sabine and out of Nacogdoches as that
</p>
<p>you are alive, although they outnumber me three to one.
</p>
<p>What may follow, I know, for I verily believe that prepa
</p>
<p>rations have been made in the interior of the provinces,
</p>
<p>to bring forward to this frontier as many men as they
</p>
<p>may deem necessary, and commanding as they do a thou
</p>
<p>sand or a million of mules and horses at their will, with
</p>
<p>a country covered with beef cattle, no difficulty can occur
</p>
<p>on the score of provisions. If therefore, this business
</p>
<p>should not be speedily terminated by negociations you
</p>
<p>must speedily send me a force to support our pretensions,
</p>
<p>or we must yield them up, together with the Territory
</p>
<p>of Orleans. Five thousand mounted infantry to operate
</p>
<p>as dragoons, or fight on foot, may suffice to carry us
</p>
<p>forward as far as the Grand River ; % there we shall
</p>
<p>require five thousand more to conduct us to Monterey, the
</p>
<p>capital of the province of Nuevo Reino de Leon ; after
</p>
<p>which, from twenty to thirty thousand will be necessary
</p>
<p>to carry our conquests to California, and the Isthmus of
</p>
<p>Darien. I write in haste, freely and confidentially.&quot;
</p>
<p>Perhaps nowhere does Wilkinson betray more of
</p>
<p>what he hoped the crisis would lead to. The forces that
</p>
<p>Smith was to send him were none other than those
</p>
<p>gathering under the auspices of Burr along the Ohio
</p>
<p>and the Cumberland ; and these were to save the Terri
</p>
<p>tory of Orleans and &quot;carry our conquests to California
</p>
<p>and the Isthmus of Darien.&quot; Wilkinson had not yet
</p>
<p>discovered that Smith was a traitor, and that the men
</p>
<p>he solicited plotted not only the conquest of Spanish
</p>
<p>America to the Isthmus, but also the subjugation of the
</p>
<p>Mississippi Valley!
</p>
<p>If Wilkinson, like many others, believed it possible
</p>
<p>to overrun so much of the soil owning the allegiance of

<p>132 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>were the Spaniards in Mexico, they were disposed to
</p>
<p>sneer. The official organ of the viceroyalty, the Gazeta
</p>
<p>de Mexico commenting on some paragraphs from the
</p>
<p>Moniteur de la Louisiane, the journal of the French
</p>
<p>population of New Orleans, concerning the advance
</p>
<p>of the Americans shows that there were fears of an
</p>
<p>invasion. While nothing serious was anticipated, the
</p>
<p>Americans were roundly abused.
</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody doubts,&quot; penned the arrogant editor of the
</p>
<p>Gazeta ; &quot;that if these forces have determined to enter
</p>
<p>the dominions of the King of Spain (to prevent the shed

<p>will be driven back and the country occupied. But this

</p>
<p>to the unfolding revolution; as insensible of the fact
</p>
<p>that the whole fabric of the Spanish colonial system
</p>
<p>was rotten and to be cast away. If the King expected
</p>
<p>the unhappy Criollos to execute against the Ameri
</p>
<p>cans the dire prediction uttered by the Gazeia, the
</p>
<p>short space of four years brought answer in the Grito
</p>
<p>of Hidalgo at Dolores, and in the slaughtering of the
</p>
<p>Gachitpines in the Alhondiga of Las Granaditas. As
</p>
<p>to the leaders, Cordero was stern with age and a
</p>
<p>thorough-going Spaniard; but Herrera, who had trav
</p>
<p>eled and was familiar with the system of government
</p>
<p>of the United States and the language of its people
</p>
<p>(one of whom he had wed), was the last man to bring,
</p>
<p>if escape were possible, a calamity upon the country
</p>
<p>he served.
</p>
<p>Cordero, the ranking officer, was encamped at
</p>
<p>Nacogdoches. About half the army was under his
</p>
<p>immediate direction, while the rest, some four hundred
</p>
<p>men, under Herrera bivouacked at Bayou Pierre. But
</p>
<p>when Wilkinson reached Natchitoches it was not with
</p>
<p>Herrera, commander of the offending corps, that he
</p>
<p>opened communications. The day following his arrival
</p>
<p>he made his first remonstrance to Cordero. Referring
</p>
<p>briefly to the correspondence which had passed between
</p>
<p>Cordero and Cushing, Herrera and Claiborne, the Gen
</p>
<p>eral plunged into a discussion of the merits of our terri

<p>torial claims, laying special emphasis on the French
</p>
<p>view. In his characteristic language he explained that

<p>and that he meant to do this at any cost. The Spanish
</p>
<p>troops to the east of the Sabine were invaders, as the
</p>
<p>Government had pronounced them on a former occa
</p>
<p>sion, and if they chose not to evacuate, then must they
</p>
<p>be expelled by force. 1
</p>
<p>Cordero s reply, dated September 29th, was curt
</p>
<p>and anything but satisfactory. It was not in his power,
</p>
<p>he said, to act contrary to the orders of his superior,
</p>
<p>and they forbade yielding the point under discussion.
</p>
<p>While he regretted the situation he could do noth
</p>
<p>ing until he heard from Salcedo, to whom he had
</p>
<p>dispatched a special messenger. This situation was
</p>
<p>apparently all that Wilkinson could wish. The\motley
</p>
<p>Mexican militia would not be withdrawn, and the
</p>
<p>&quot;meeting&quot; of which he had written to his friends was
</p>
<p>certain of issue.
</p>
<p>But the best-laid plans are frequently undone. The
</p>
<p>twenty-seventh of September, while Burr sat at a
</p>
<p>banquet in Nashville and the crowd lustily cheered the
</p>
<p>toast of Jackson, &quot;Millions for defense; not one cent

</p>
<p>upon the scene. Herrera had written more than once
</p>
<p>that he meant to preserve inviolate that region to the

<p>hopelessness of holding out against the superior force

<p>of Wilkinson ; that the question of war or peace rested
</p>
<p>with him, and he acted on his own responsibility.
</p>
<p>Could he have foreseen the inevitable disasters involved

<p>in a war with the United States? The enemies of the

<p>General were prone to say that Herrera was bribed, but
</p>
<p>that was far from the truth. Wilkinson played no

</p>
<p>Wilkinson s Duplicity
</p>
<p>*
</p>
<p>WHEN Wilkinson had recovered his equa
</p>
<p>nimity after the retreat of Herrera, he quickly
</p>
<p>devised another schedule of operations. It
</p>
<p>was no less a one than to abandon Burr if indeed he
</p>
<p>had not always intended doing so to strike a com
</p>
<p>promise with the Spaniards, and to drive his own
</p>
<p>criminal ends with an impetuosity and finesse which
</p>
<p>were only too successful. October 4, 1806, he ren
</p>
<p>dered to the Government an account of things on the
</p>
<p>border :
</p>
<p>&quot;The Spaniard,&quot; he wrote Dearborn, 1 &quot;raised his camp
</p>
<p>at Bayou Pierre on the twenty-seventh ultimo, . . .
</p>
<p>and on the thirtieth crossed the Sabine and took post
</p>
<p>on the right bank, where Colonel Gushing left him the
</p>
<p>first instant. ... I shall continue my preparations
</p>
<p>for defense and offense, and tojwipe off the species of
</p>
<p>stigma which cavilers may attach to the Spaniards re
</p>
<p>possession of the ground from whence we had driven
</p>
<p>them ; to give confidence to our friends, to confirm the
</p>
<p>wavering and the disaffected ; and, above all, to assert
</p>
<p>unequivocally the pretensions of the government, I have
</p>
<p>taken post within the limits claimed by the officers of
</p>
<p>Spain, and in a few days shall move forward to the east
</p>
<p>bank of the Sabine, where I shall wait the answer of the
</p>
<p>Captain-General Salcedo.&quot;
</p>
<p>Had the wavering known what was now in his
</p>
<p>mind they would no doubt have been won over, while

</p>
<p>the confidence of his friends would indeed have been
</p>
<p>unbounded. Unhappily neither his friends, his ene
</p>
<p>mies, nor yet the wavering, knew the inner history of
</p>
<p>this campaign. We shall see at once that he did not
</p>
<p>move forward on schedule; that he did not assert
</p>
<p>unequivocally the pretensions of the Government to the
</p>
<p>land in dispute ; and that he did not, as he stated in the
</p>
<p>same paper, dismiss the militia. The day he started the
</p>
<p>above letter to Washington, he wrote cordially to Cor-
</p>
<p>dero in reply to his note of the twenty-ninth ult, which
</p>
<p>had been received at the hand of Gushing :
</p>
<p>I shall despatch my troops to the Sabine, he said
</p>
<p>dispassionately, and I hope you will interpret the motive
</p>
<p>only as signifying the pretensions of the United States
</p>
<p>to the east bank of the river, and not as an act of hostility
</p>
<p>against the Spanish troops. The honor of the United
</p>
<p>States demands the move, and it is justified by the posi
</p>
<p>tion assumed by Governor Herrera next the Sabine,
</p>
<p>twenty leagues from the post of Nacogdoches.
</p>
<p>Nothing is here said of asserting the authority of
</p>
<p>the United States unequivocally it is only pretensions.
</p>
<p>This specific message was clearly intended to open the
</p>
<p>way to an understanding with the inexorable Governor,
</p>
<p>and the utter ignoring of the subject-matter of his cor
</p>
<p>respondence was another step in this direction. From
</p>
<p>this time forward Wilkinson exerted himself to the
</p>
<p>utmost to make friends of the two opposing leaders, but
</p>
<p>with ill success in the case of Cordero, whose response
</p>
<p>was as emphatic as unconciliatory :

<p>138 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>my hopes, you have marched your troops toward the
</p>
<p>Sabine. . . . Your excellency is well acquainted
</p>
<p>with the sacred duties of a soldier : I must in consequence
</p>
<p>declare to your excellency that, though the results which
</p>
<p>your excellency has undertaken ought not, in any manner
</p>
<p>whatever, to be considered as an act of hostility provoked
</p>
<p>by my government, I must oppose myself to it in the dis
</p>
<p>charge of the obligation which I am under, to oppose my
</p>
<p>self to the aggressions of the United States, and to pre
</p>
<p>serve entire, as far as lies in my power, the dominions of
</p>
<p>my sovereign.&quot;
</p>
<p>Cordero s declaration that he meant to oppose the
</p>
<p>march of the Americans was a bit of idle talk, for he
</p>
<p>never so much as left the fort at Nacogdoches in the
</p>
<p>discharge of his obligation to oppose &quot;the aggressions
</p>
<p>of the United States.&quot; And it was well that he did
</p>
<p>not, for the idea of employing force had been aban
</p>
<p>doned by those in authority. Herrera was justified in
</p>
<p>having retreated from the disputed tract by Salcedo,
</p>
<p>in an order dated October 24th, from the Hacienda de
</p>
<p>los Ornos; likewise Cordero. The Captain-General s
</p>
<p>words to the latter were to the effect that under no
</p>
<p>circumstances should an attack be made on the Ameri
</p>
<p>can forces; the territory in dispute should not be
</p>
<p>jeopardized, though it were many times occupied. 1
</p>
<p>October 8th, two weeks after the retreat of Herrera,
</p>
<p>while Wilkinson was still idle in camp, though profess
</p>
<p>ing to be in the utmost haste to follow the retreating
</p>
<p>Spaniards to the Sabine, Samuel Swartwout, after a
</p>
<p>long pursuit of the General, reached Natchitoches with
</p>
<p>Burr s famous letter of July 29th. 2 It was in the even-

<p>ing, and Wilkinson was alone wkh Colonel Cushing of
</p>
<p>the Second Infantry, when Swartwout appeared with a
</p>
<p>note of introduction from ex-Senator Dayton.
</p>
<p>Cushing subsequently deposed that the morning
</p>
<p>after Swartwout s coming the General said to him that
</p>
<p>he had some serious information to communicate. --j
</p>
<p>After asking Cushing whether he had heard of an
</p>
<p>enterprise being under way in the West, he related that
</p>
<p>&quot;a great number of individuals possessing wealth,
</p>
<p>popularity, and talents [were] associated for purposes
</p>
<p>inimical to the Government of the United States.&quot;
</p>
<p>Burr was at their head and Swartwout, who had
</p>
<p>brought the cipher letter containing this treasonable
</p>
<p>information, was his emissary. Burr had funds; the
</p>
<p>navy was with him; and Wilkinson was to be second
</p>
<p>in authority, distributing honors and emoluments to
</p>
<p>the officers under his command. But the General
</p>
<p>avoided saying a word as to the ulterior objects of the
</p>
<p>expedition forming in the West : the matter of attack
</p>
<p>ing Baton Rouge, and of advancing into a land where
</p>
<p>the natives were ready to receive them. Already, how
</p>
<p>ever, the General had devised plans for the crushing of
</p>
<p>the movement ; these he confided to Cushing. He would
</p>
<p>march at once to the Sabine and make terms with the
</p>
<p>Spanish commander, and then take what measures/ he
</p>
<p>thought the safety of the country demanded-. 1 This
</p>
<p>resolution seems to have been reached over night; but
</p>
<p>in reality the arrival of Burr s packet was only the occa
</p>
<p>sion for its enunciation the outlines of his course had
</p>
<p>been fixed, the details were to be determined by events.

<p>i 4 o THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>-* A single night the larger part of which, according to
</p>
<p>the General s own evidence, was spent in deciphering
</p>
<p>Burr s letter is hardly time to mature a deeply in
</p>
<p>volved piece of human action.
</p>
<p>Swartwout remained a week at Natchitoches, dur
</p>
<p>ing which time, according to the General, he opened up
</p>
<p>to him the whole of the infamous business of the crew
</p>
<p>of traitors. Wilkinson made much of these alleged dis
</p>
<p>closures, but no reliance whatever, as we shall see, can
</p>
<p>be placed in his story. At the moment of Swartwout s
</p>
<p>departure for New Orleans Farrar s dragoons rode into
</p>
<p>camp, and in the company was one Walter Burling. He
</p>
<p>was known to the General, and the very day he reached
</p>
<p>the camp the secret of the conspiracy was opened to
</p>
<p>him, his opinion being asked as to measures to be pur
</p>
<p>sued. But before answer could be made he was told
</p>
<p>by the General that he himself had come to a decision i 1
</p>
<p>and strange to say it was the same as that given Gush
</p>
<p>ing the morning after the receipt of Burr s letter. Bur
</p>
<p>ling, who was only a well-to-do farmer living near
</p>
<p>Natchez, was at once taken into the official family of
</p>
<p>the commander-in-chief made an aide-de-camp, and
</p>
<p>thereafter remained his &quot;dear and well-beloved friend.&quot;
</p>
<p>This rapid promotion and display of confidence arouses
</p>
<p>the suspicion that they had stood on common ground at
</p>
<p>some former period; and such a haunting suspicion is
</p>
<p>almost confirmed by their later relations.
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, after the receipt of Burr s famous letter,

<p>which he declared to be treasonable, spent two weeks in

<p>Natchitoches in apparent unconcern. It was not for

</p>
<p>the Sabine ; nor was his silence prompted by patriotism.
</p>
<p>Delay and silence on his part were alike necessary to
</p>
<p>developments in the West, lie knew that if he promptly
</p>
<p>reported his information to the President, or to the
</p>
<p>governors of the Western States, the flotillas preparing
</p>
<p>on the Ohio and Cumberland would be seized on the
</p>
<p>stocks. That, in truth, was not the exit the General
</p>
<p>wished for ; and never during the course of the excite- *&amp;gt;
</p>
<p>ment did he send a word of warning to the authorities
</p>
<p>in the Ohio country.
</p>
<p>The time came when Wilkinson was ready to play
</p>
<p>another card a trump. He knew that the Government
</p>
<p>had heard through the journals the alarming stories
</p>
<p>from the West (he had kept close track of the news
</p>
<p>papers, as we know from his correspondence) and he
</p>
<p>judged, and rightly, that the Administration would be
</p>
<p>uneasy, ready for his denunciations. So, October 2Oth
</p>
<p>he wrote to the President&quot; that, frbm information based&quot;
</p>
<p>on &quot;broad and explicit grounds,&quot; he had discovered
</p>
<p>that a powerful association, extending from New York
</p>
<p>through the Western States, had been formed for
</p>
<p>the purpose of leading an expedition against Vera

<p>Cruz i 1
</p>
<p>&quot;Agents from Mexico, who were in Philadelphia in

<p>the beginning of August, are engaged in this enterprise ;

<p>Had Wilkinson stopped there he would have come

<p>near the truth; but after telling Cushing and others
</p>
<p>that Burr was at the head of this association, at whose
</p>
<p>bottom was treason, he had the audacity to say to the
</p>
<p>President that it was &quot;unknown under what authority&quot;
</p>
<p>the enterprise had been projected; and that the &quot;inten
</p>
<p>tion of its leaders, in relation to the Territory of
</p>
<p>Orleans,&quot; was a matter of doubt. This letter was pur
</p>
<p>posely ambiguous and non-committal the way had to
</p>
<p>be prepared. The day following, in a confidential dis
</p>
<p>patch to Jefferson, he said :
</p>
<p>&quot;Although my information appears too direct and cir
</p>
<p>cumstantial to be fictitious, yet the magnitude of the

<p>my belief and excite doubts of the reality, against the con

<p>great public calamity, and not to mar a salutary design,
</p>
<p>or to injure anyone undeservedly.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>Had Jefferson exercised even ordinary discernment

<p>is expected.&quot;
</p>
<p>The names he forbore in the first paragraph to
</p>
<p>commit, by the next had never been part of his informa
</p>
<p>tion. Extraordinary ! But more extraordinary was the
</p>
<p>masterly way in which he introduced the subject of the
</p>
<p>treasonable side of the conspiracy:
</p>
<p>&quot;Should this association be formed in opposition to
</p>
<p>the laws and in defiance of the Government, then I have
</p>
<p>no doubt the revolt of this territory will be made an
</p>
<p>auxiliary step to the main design of attacking Mexico, to
</p>
<p>give it a new. master in the place of promised liberty.
</p>
<p>Should the fact be ascertained to me, I believe I should
</p>
<p>hazard my discretion, make the best compromise with
</p>
<p>Salcedo in my power, and throw myself with my little
</p>
<p>band into New Orleans to be ready to defend the capital
</p>
<p>against usurpation and violence.&quot;
</p>
<p>After this sentence remarkable not only for its
</p>
<p>cunning dissimulation, but also for its characterization
</p>
<p>of the expedition and the fling at Burr he stated his
</p>
<p>programme, which was indeed a frank divulgence of
</p>
<p>what was in his mind, a foreword of the history of his
</p>
<p>violent usurpation of power in New Orleans. There
</p>
<p>was, moreover, to this letter a foot-note. The defense
</p>
<p>in the trial at Richmond took Wilkinson to task over it ;
</p>
<p>but he attempted to extricate himself by swearing that .
</p>
<p>the &quot;N. B.&quot; in question was a subsequent addition.
</p>
<p>The original MS., however, bluntly contradicts him:

<p>of the associates and by a suitable appeal to their patriot
</p>
<p>ism to engage them in the service of their country? I
</p>
<p>merely offer the suggestion as a possible expedient to pre
</p>
<p>vent the horrors of a civil contest, and I do believe that
</p>
<p>with competent authority I could accomplish the object.&quot;
</p>
<p>Had Wilkinson left no other trace of his desperate
</p>
<p>effort to make out a case of treason against the West
</p>
<p>erners which effort was singularly abetted by circum
</p>
<p>stances and the cumulative energy of a score of years
</p>
<p>of history of Spanish intrigue and discontent in the
</p>
<p>West, and little understood had Wilkinson left no
</p>
<p>other trace of his vicious manoeuvres, of his brazen
</p>
<p>double-dealings, this note would irretrievably condemn
</p>
<p>him. He represented to the President that Burr s
</p>
<p>4 followers were desperate &quot;bandits&quot; ; but to make him
</p>
<p>self secure in any case, he indicated that they might be
</p>
<p>diverted from their purposes of treason and led against
</p>
<p>the Spaniards. Truly a wonderful spectacle, a body
</p>
<p>of traitors metamorphosed into patriots! 1
</p>
<p>While thus engaged in launching his schemes, scat
</p>
<p>tering alarms in every direction, he did not fail to
</p>
<p>provide for his own safety. He knew that already
</p>
<p>the Lexington Gazette and the Western World had
</p>
<p>assailed his character with incontrovertible evidences
</p>
<p>i of guilt &quot;intriguer and pensioner of Spain, now as

<p>sociated with Aaron Burr in reviving the old Spanish

<p>gathering, but with the President to sustain him it

</p>
<p>In a second letter of October 2ist he confidentially

<p>as he did descend to the task of refuting the charges
</p>
<p>and we have his Memoirs, which will ever remain a
</p>
<p>ponderous proof of his infamy. To Jefferson the
</p>
<p>authentic documents were unnecessary ; but Wilkinson,
</p>
<p>trembling lest the thread of his life should be &quot;unsea
</p>
<p>sonably cut,&quot; vowed to the President that they were
</p>
<p>in existence and might be available &quot;to silence the mis
</p>
<p>representations of my enemies and to justify your
</p>
<p>predilection&quot; :
</p>
<p>&quot;Pardon, I beseech you, the honest pride which impels
</p>
<p>me to bare my bosom to you. My ultimate views are
</p>
<p>limited to the acquisition of an honorable fame. I have
</p>
<p>ever contemned the sordid interests of the world, and
</p>
<p>estimate property by its immediate utility only and it is
</p>
<p>the highest ambition of my soul on a proper occasion, to
</p>
<p>spend my last breath in the cause of my country. A
</p>
<p>frail character, but a just one. To you I owe more than
</p>
<p>I will express, lest I should be suspected of adulation,
</p>
<p>which I detest. Suffice it [that?] I shall serve the nation
</p>
<p>with zeal and fidelity, and that your trust can never be
</p>
<p>disgraced.&quot;
</p>
<p>Within two weeks his &quot;ultimate views&quot; were lim
</p>
<p>ited to the acquisition of an &quot;honorable&quot; fortune, and
</p>
<p>Jefferson s trust was already disgraced. Apart from
</p>
<p>the unmasking of his character, the real importance of
</p>
<p>the foregoing letter hangs on the mention of the West
</p>
<p>ern World. It proves that the attack on Aaron Burr
</p>
<p>and his project were not unknown to the man who had

<p>course from the path of honor/ Indeed, early in the
</p>
<p>WILKINSON S DUPLICITY 147
</p>
<p>year the General had been successfully pricked by
</p>
<p>communications appearing in the Lexington Gazette.
</p>
<p>He was there charged with thoughts and deeds which
</p>
<p>caused him so much uneasiness that he essayed a
</p>
<p>sweeping denunciation of the whole catalogue :
</p>
<p>&quot;Several vile, malignant, and groundless fabrications,&quot;
</p>
<p>he wrote to Editor Daniel Bradford of the Lexington Ga
</p>
<p>zette, &quot;having lately issued from your press with design
</p>
<p>to stab my reputation, I should feel myself unworthy the
</p>
<p>confidence with which I am honored, did I suffer them,
</p>
<p>however contemptible, to pass unnoticed. . . . This
</p>
<p>may be considered the last desperate resort of an expiring
</p>
<p>faction. ... I have barely time before the departure
</p>
<p>of the mail to assure [you] that the innuendoes and asser
</p>
<p>tions of this letter writer are substantially false and
</p>
<p>groundless.&quot; *
</p>
<p>Wilkinson saw that Burr was joined with him in
</p>
<p>an enterprise which was declared to embrace the old
</p>
<p>idea of the Spanish Conspiracy with the new one of the
</p>
<p>invasion of Mexico; that the people were wrought up
</p>
<p>to a high pitch of excitement, and, keen-witted as he
</p>
<p>was, he realized that the moment for action had arrived
</p>
<p>the moment when he should redeem his fame and
</p>
<p>fortune! He knew from his own earlier experiences
</p>
<p>that no power could commit the West to the cause of
</p>
<p>treason, even though at the moment that was the talk
</p>
<p>of every countryside. So outspoken were the Western

<p>ers in their professions of loyalty, he hesitated long

</p>
<p>or the crime of plotting the unlawful invasion of a
</p>
<p>neighboring sovereign s domains. Notwithstanding,
</p>
<p>he was assiduously agitating the former view, and did
</p>
<p>more than all other forces to fasten the stigma of
</p>
<p>treason on the followers of Aaron Burr. Even while
</p>
<p>making his reports to the Government, and outlining
</p>
<p>his programme of peace with the Spaniards, he cajoled
</p>
<p>his brother officers with the likelihood of a war, never
</p>
<p>mentioning the crisis rising along the Ohio. Two days
</p>
<p>after his plaintive letter to the President, and the day
</p>
<p>he set out on his march to the Sabine, he wrote to
</p>
<p>Colonel Freeman, commander in New Orleans i 1
</p>
<p>&quot;Under my present views and impressions, I have not
</p>
<p>the least doubt, we shall soon be engaged in hostilities,
</p>
<p>and therefore, every preparation for defence should be
</p>
<p>made, which our humble means may enable. By buy
</p>
<p>ing up all the paper to be had in this country, I have made
</p>
<p>up about thirty-five rounds of musket cartridges for six
</p>
<p>hundred men a handsome stock for a campaign, and
</p>
<p>when it may become immediately necessary, to quadruple
</p>
<p>our force.&quot;
</p>
<p>When Wilkinson wrote this he knew there was no
</p>
<p>probability of an engagement taking place; he set out
</p>
<p>on his march with but one object in view to make
</p>
<p>peace with the Spaniards. On the other hand, he
</p>
<p>brought his letter to a close in a paragraph calculated
</p>
<p>to try the nerves of any man :
</p>
<p>&quot;Your place,&quot; referring to the rehabilitation of the
</p>
<p>old forts about New Orleans, &quot;is to be completed about

<p>secured. Should this operation excite enquiry, you are to
</p>
<p>say the plan of fortification has been varied, and that the
</p>
<p>Secretary of War has ordered the repairs of the old work.
</p>
<p>I cannot explain to you, at this time, the causes which
</p>
<p>prescribe this measure ; but they are of a nature too impe
</p>
<p>rious to be resisted, and too highly confidential to be
</p>
<p>whispered, or even suspected. Your silence, therefore,
</p>
<p>must be profound; and while you pursue the operations
</p>
<p>most industriously, you must show no anxiety, nor offer
</p>
<p>allusion (even conjectural) to any specific object,&quot;
</p>
<p>A month after Herrera had raised his camp, almost
</p>
<p>a month after Wilkinson had written that he would be
</p>
<p>ready to advance, he actually set out with flags flying
</p>
<p>and scouts and skirmishers in order, fearing, as he
</p>
<p>said, an attack. It was an idle march, selfishly begun
</p>
<p>and disgracefully ended. The graphic descriptions
</p>
<p>some writers have left us of how Wilkinson manoeuvred
</p>
<p>the Spaniards out of the land, closed an advantageous
</p>
<p>treaty with them, and rushed in the breach to save the
</p>
<p>Nation from an army of traitors, once more forcibly
</p>
<p>illustrates that history can be woven of fiction, and
</p>
<p>that truth itself may be ofttimes buried under the black
</p>
<p>stain of the false!
</p>
<p>Without meeting with so much as a Spanish patrol,
</p>
<p>the American army halted, October 2Qth, on the east
</p>
<p>bank of the Sabine. Wilkinson had the day before sent
</p>
<p>a dispatch to Cordero by his aide-de-camp, Walter Bur
</p>
<p>ling, which was to the effect that, without yielding a
</p>
<p>pretension or ceding a right, the two powers should
</p>
<p>retire to Nacogdoches and Natchitoches respectively.
</p>
<p>Another condition was that the Spaniards should not
</p>
<p>cross the Sabine, nor the Americans the Arroyo Hondo.

</p>
<p>A copy of these proposals, Burling tells us, was left
</p>
<p>150 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>with Herrera, who commanded on the Sabine. At
</p>
<p>noon, November ist, the aide delivered his note to Cor-
</p>
<p>dero; the third, Burling started back with Cordero s
</p>
<p>answer. The old cavalier, from the fort of Nacog-
</p>
<p>doches which the American filibusters were to occupy
</p>
<p>a few years later, replied, as he had done on another
</p>
<p>occasion, that he could do nothing; that Salcedo held
</p>
<p>the final decision; and that the proposition had been
</p>
<p>sent to him with all haste. The Captain-General, how
</p>
<p>ever, was not destined in the first instance to pass
</p>
<p>upon it there was no time to wait for his judgment.
</p>
<p>When Burling on his return reached the Spanish
</p>
<p>camp on the Sabine, Herrera announced his acceptance
</p>
<p>of the articles. The next day, November 5th, Inspector
</p>
<p>Viana appeared in the American camp, and the pact
</p>
<p>known as the Neutral Ground Treaty was duly con
</p>
<p>cluded. 1 For Wilkinson thi was a great triumph in
</p>
<p>the eyes of the world the greatest he ever won. It was,
</p>
<p>in fact, but a phase in an unsurpassed scheme of impos
</p>
<p>ture and rascality. Such a reconciliation was absolutely
</p>
<p>essential to the success of his own designs.
</p>
<p>The day after the celebration of the pact of peace
</p>
<p>with Herrera, Wilkinson sent the following dispatch to
</p>
<p>Cordero :
</p>
<p>&quot;The conciliatory aspect of your letter which I had
</p>
<p>the honor to receive yesterday by the hand of my aide-

</p>
<p>respondence, have removed from my mind the idea of
</p>
<p>premeditated hostilities on the part of Spain against the
</p>
<p>United States. After I have complied with my orders

<p>WILKINSON S DUPLICITY 151
</p>
<p>it is my desire that the act shall in no wise lessen the
</p>
<p>amicable spirit existing between my government and the
</p>
<p>government you have the honor to serve. I shall in a
</p>
<p>day or two move my troops from this point to Natchito-
</p>
<p>ches, and I trust that the orders to the troops under your
</p>
<p>command will not be varied, and will be strictly observed
</p>
<p>until the conclusion of the negotiations now pending.&quot;
</p>
<p>It was a clever ruse of Wilkinson to pretend that he
</p>
<p>had &quot;proclaimed the jurisdiction of the United States&quot;
</p>
<p>to the Sabine ; only the -initiated knew that over the
</p>
<p>region from the Arroyo Hondo to the Sabine neutrality
</p>
<p>had been declared ; and it was singularly presumptuous
</p>
<p>in Wilkinson to suppose that Cordero could or would
</p>
<p>conform to the stipulations of a treaty to which he, as
</p>
<p>superior officer, had not assented, and which from its
</p>
<p>very irregularity could have no binding force. The
</p>
<p>General, however, was satisfied with the situation,
</p>
<p>which promised at any time to reopen the controversy,
</p>
<p>and turned with eagerness to the more serious part of
</p>
<p>his programme the first act of which was to deceive
</p>
<p>his army. The morning of the fifth of November the
</p>
<p>following general order was read by Burling to the
</p>
<p>army which was mustered for review :
</p>
<p>&quot;His Excellency, Governor Herrera, the military chief,
</p>
<p>immediately opposed to this corps, having agreed to with
</p>
<p>draw his troops to Nacogdoches and to prohibit their
</p>
<p>recrossing the v Sabine River pending the negotiations
</p>
<p>between the United States and Spain, the objects of this
</p>
<p>expedition are accomplished and the camp will, of course,
</p>
<p>be raised to-morrow or the next day, and Colonel Cush-
</p>
<p>ing will lead back the troops to Natchitoches.&quot;

<p>ceeded to praise the army in grandiloquent terms for
</p>
<p>152 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>having served the country so bravely and so patri
</p>
<p>otically, flattering in turn each individual company.
</p>
<p>And thus was announced the Neutral Ground Treaty. 1
</p>
<p>It was highly politic in Wilkinson to conceal the
</p>
<p>real terms of the treaty. The Spaniards were not to
</p>
<p>cross the Sabine, but he said not a word about the
</p>
<p>Arroyo Hondo marking the boundary for the Ameri
</p>
<p>cans. And it was well that the volunteers, who had
</p>
<p>been chafing under enforced idleness and who longed
</p>
<p>for the din of battle, were doubly deceived ; as it was,
</p>
<p>there was great discontent at the retreat, although the
</p>
<p>first tremors of the Aaron Burr alarm had already pene
</p>
<p>trated the camp on the frontier. As late as the trial at
</p>
<p>Richmond the General covered up his treachery by re
</p>
<p>fusing to submit the text of the &quot;Convention,&quot; throwing
</p>
<p>the matter back on the Executive with the words, &quot;I
</p>
<p>do not think myself at liberty to divulge its contents;&quot;
</p>
<p>answering, &quot;I cannot tell&quot; to the query, &quot;Has the
</p>
<p>jurisdiction of the United States ever been exercised as
</p>
<p>far as the Sabine ?&quot; 2 He knew it had not ; so did Jeffer
</p>
<p>son ; both were indisposed to answer the question. The
</p>
<p>fact was that the spoils had been surrendered, and both
</p>
<p>the President and his agent were loath to give out the
</p>
<p>ill news. The impression was abroad that the Span
</p>
<p>iards had acknowledged the rights of the Union to the
</p>
<p>Sabine the ambitions of the Republic were therefore
</p>
<p>prospering and it would have been a shock, dangerous
</p>
<p>at the moment, to have dispelled the illusion. It was
</p>
<p>*It was of course in no legal sense a treaty ; it was merely an
</p>
<p>agreement between unaccredited agents of the two governments.
</p>
<p>It was, however, in a measure, observed until superseded by the
</p>
<p>Treaty of Washington (1819).

</p>
<p>ment to seek a peaceful way out of the Spanish em-
</p>
<p>broglio. November 8th, three days after Wilkinson s
</p>
<p>propositions had been accepted by Herrera, the follow
</p>
<p>ing order to the General emanated from the Cabinet :*
</p>
<p>The great probability of an amicable and early settle
</p>
<p>ment of our differences with Spain at Paris has rendered
</p>
<p>the Executive extremely desirous of avoiding hostilities.
</p>
<p>He has therefore determined to assume the Sabine as tne
</p>
<p>temporary line; and that the Spaniards shall not hold
</p>
<p>any fort save Bayou Pierre beyond the Sabine/
</p>
<p>But hostilities were thought to have begun already.
</p>
<p>In that case Wilkinson was to propose to the Span
</p>
<p>iards :
</p>
<p>i. That hostilities shall be suspended that the
</p>
<p>Sabine shall be accepted as the temporary boundary
</p>
<p>the Americans not passing to the west, the Spaniards to
</p>
<p>the east.
</p>
<p>2. Intercourse shall be restored between the citi
</p>
<p>zens dwelling on either side. Or, as an alternative, that
</p>
<p>intercourse shall not be resumed.
</p>
<p>3. Neither party shall establish military posts, but
</p>
<p>may strengthen those held.
</p>
<p>4. Neither party shall incite the Indians to take up
</p>
<p>arms.
</p>
<p>5. Citizens or subjects, prisoners of either, shall be
</p>
<p>released.
</p>
<p>6. The supreme authority of either nation may re
</p>
<p>voke the treaty, but no action shall be taken without a
</p>
<p>month s notice.
</p>
<p>Notes. If you cannot agree on the Sabine, make
</p>
<p>some other boundary. It is imperatively ordered that if
</p>
<p>hostilities have not begun, Wilkinson must remain on the
</p>
<p>defensive; and in no event cross the Sabine River. If

<p>hostilities have begun, and any Spanish posts east of the
</p>
<p>Mississippi have been taken, they will be surrendered in
</p>
<p>case of agreement to suspend hostilities/

</p>
<p>The anxiety of those in power was manifest. Once
</p>
<p>they had hesitated to move, but the time was now come
</p>
<p>when war was tacitly accepted, if the foreigners chose
</p>
<p>to insist on what they deemed their rights territorial
</p>
<p>rights which were in conflict with the limits of Louisi
</p>
<p>ana as set by the Americans. However, another turn
</p>
<p>of the wheel had changed the combinations, and Jef
</p>
<p>ferson was seized with his chronic malady fear of
</p>
<p>war and of European entanglements. Once more, with
</p>
<p>the same empty result, he pinned his faith on Napoleon,
</p>
<p>who, he believed, meant to settle the dispute creditably.
</p>
<p>For a moment, too, his easy confidence in the loyalty
</p>
<p>of the Westerners wavered on the receipt of the news
</p>
<p>of the formidable preparations of Aaron Burr. Not
</p>
<p>even the hope of the conquest of the Floridas, in his
</p>
<p>mind, warranted the continuance of the war (war was
</p>
<p>supposed to have begun) ; and these precious domin
</p>
<p>ions, much as Jefferson yearned for them, must be re
</p>
<p>turned to the enemy in case they had been taken. Such
</p>
<p>a state of affairs forcibly recalls the time when, through
</p>
<p>our national weakness, we were brought humbly to the
</p>
<p>feet of the powers of the Old World.
</p>
<p>But Jefferson, as well as Wilkinson, was misled in
</p>
<p>believing that the Spaniards had crossed the Sabine
</p>
<p>for the purpose of fighting. The President was doubly
</p>
<p>misled, because he calculated on a speedy and complete
</p>
<p>fulfillment of the orders which had been issued concern
</p>
<p>ing the expulsion of the enemy. Nevertheless, Wilkin
</p>
<p>son s procrastination was unparalleled, and now that
</p>
<p>but one course was open he entered it naturally.

</p>
<p>him, for the Government had discussed it ; but that he
</p>
<p>should have anticipated the wish of Jefferson was a
</p>
<p>strong point in his favor.
</p>
<p>Those who wielded the delegated Bourbon authority
</p>
<p>in New Spain at once appreciated the advantages which
</p>
<p>had accrued to them through the establishment of the
</p>
<p>status quo. The Captain-General of the Internal Prov
</p>
<p>inces left Chihuahua for the frontier as the danger
</p>
<p>seemed to increase. The news of the agreement reached
</p>
<p>him at San Antonio de Bexar, whereupon he wrote, De
</p>
<p>cember 3d, to Viceroy Iturrigaray that &quot;this treaty
</p>
<p>insures the integrity of the Spanish dominions along
</p>
<p>the whole of the great extension of frontier.&quot; Much
</p>
<p>correspondence passed between the Viceroy and the
</p>
<p>home Government concerning not only the establish
</p>
<p>ment of the status quo, but also the dangers which
</p>
<p>might arise from the Anglo-American peril. 2 The
</p>
<p>treaty itself was accepted as a real victory ; and indeed
</p>
<p>such it was. Without warrant of Congress, without
</p>
<p>the consent or advice of the Executive, Wilkinson com
</p>
<p>promised the claim of the United States to what was
</p>
<p>known as the Neutral Ground ; and without the shadow
</p>
<p>of authority rendered ridiculous our pretensions to the
</p>
<p>Rio Grande as the western limit of Louisiana! The
</p>
<p>mere recognition of a neutral ground presupposed two
</p>
<p>adjacent areas whose titles are not in doubt. When

<p>to Louisiana, though we chose to respect the feelings of

<p>Spain by pretending to buy it we were obliged to lay
</p>
<p>the honest debts of our citizens in the scales. Not
</p>
<p>meaning in any sense to justify the contention that we
</p>
<p>were by right entitled to the Rio Grande as our bound-
</p>
<p>dary on the west, it is necessary to view the matter in
</p>
<p>the light of the time. We claimed the province of

<p>Texas, or at least a part of it; had carried on heated
</p>
<p>diplomatic negotiations concerning it, and thus to yield

<p>it 1 without a blow was inexplicable to all save the Gen
</p>
<p>eral who knew the price of peace.
</p>
<p>With quiet restored on the Sabine Wilkinson hur
</p>
<p>ried to Natchitoches, which he reached the seventh of
</p>
<p>November. The same day he sent to Colonel Cushing,
</p>
<p>who was leading the army to New Orleans, and to
</p>
<p>Colonel Freeman, documents of varying degrees of
</p>
<p>intelligibility.

<p>&quot;By letters found here,&quot; he revealed to Cushing, 1 &quot;I

<p>the minutiae to you, I will barely suggest the propriety
</p>
<p>of calling his incessant attention to the repair and preser
</p>
<p>vation of the arms, ammunition, and ordnance deposited
</p>
<p>with him ; and also to every appurtenant of the quarter
</p>
<p>master s department. He must keepi a strict eye on the
</p>
<p>conduct of the Spaniards, on the side of Texhas, and is to
</p>
<p>advise me by express at New Orleans, of every casualty
</p>
<p>which may occur, or any change which may be made by
</p>
<p>them. I have nothing more to add, but to entreat you to
</p>
<p>accelerate your movement by every practicable means. I
</p>
<p>think officers who have families at Fort Adams should be
</p>
<p>advised to leave them there, for if I mistake not, we shall
</p>
<p>have an insurrection of blacks as well as whites to com-
</p>
<p>bat. . . . No consideration, my friend, of family or
</p>
<p>personal inconvenience, must detain the troops a moment
</p>
<p>longer than can be avoided, either by land or by water ;
</p>
<p>they must come, and rapidly. On the fifteenth of this
</p>
<p>month, Burr s declaration is to be made in Tennessee and
</p>
<p>Kentucky ; hurry, hurry after me, and, if necessary, let
</p>
<p>us be buried together in the ruins of the place we shall
</p>
<p>defend.&quot;
</p>
<p>It was at least a variation to tell Cushing that the
</p>
<p>negroes were to revolt ; but he never explained what he
</p>
<p>meant by saying that Burr s declaration was to be made
</p>
<p>in Tennessee and Kentucky November 1 5th ; which day
</p>
<p>the ex-Vice-President spent quietly in Lexington.
</p>
<p>Then the urgent order for the marching of the troops
</p>
<p>was converted into arrant nonsense by the dilatoriness
</p>
<p>of his own movements. To Colonel Freeman in New
</p>
<p>Orleans he said: 1
</p>

<p>descends with a body of artificers, and laboratory men to

<p>rounded by secret agents, yet use every exertion in your
</p>
<p>power. ... I shall be with you by the twentieth
</p>
<p>instant ; in the meantime, be you as silent as the grave.&quot;
</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the matter he wanted kept
</p>
<p>silent as the grave had already become notorious on the
</p>
<p>frontier. A friend of Spain in Natchitoches wrote on
</p>
<p>the eighth instant to Herrera, who had retired to

<p>Nacogdoches i 1
</p>
<p>&quot;Our political crisis is going to produce effects of
</p>
<p>much importance to us and to our neighbors. General
</p>
<p>Wilkinson has received notices which have occasioned the
</p>
<p>hasty movement of all the troops to New Orleans. The
</p>
<p>General said in confidence to a friend that he had news
</p>
<p>which, he could not then make public, but which the
</p>
<p>human heart discovers. He went by Natchez to spend
</p>
<p>one night with his wife, since he had to go forward in
</p>
<p>great haste to the city in order to direct the operations.
</p>
<p>There are three conjectures: first, war with Spain; sec
</p>
<p>ond, a revolution in the States; third, a strong party to
</p>
<p>unite with Miranda. Lieutenant Murray has received let
</p>
<p>ters on the latter subject in which he is offered an impor
</p>
<p>tant position. . . . Orders have been received to
</p>
<p>fortify New Orleans against these bandits, but the small
</p>
<p>force of the United States in that city is not sufficient to
</p>
<p>resist so formidable a body. It is believed that this band
</p>
<p>of adventurers (quadrilla de vagamundos) will destroy
</p>
<p>whatever appears before it, and that the public banks will

<p>be robbed, the ships in the ports will be equipped, and

<p>160 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>Part of this letter sounds as though Wilkinson had
</p>
<p>dictated it. The truth was, no doubt, that while Wil
</p>
<p>kinson professed to wish the matter kept a secret, he
</p>
<p>was carefully scattering it with all its exaggerations.
</p>
<p>In such a method he knew the mischief would be
</p>
<p>greater. A striking statement in the letter is the last
</p>
<p>that Burr had been obliged to fly. As a matter of
</p>
<p>fact it was but three days before Cortez wrote that
</p>
<p>Burr was first accused by Daviess in Frankfort. It
</p>
<p>simply shows that the air was surcharged with rumors
</p>
<p>of every character. Six days later Cortez forwarded
</p>
<p>another dispatch.
</p>
<p>&quot;I sent you a letter some days ago which I hope has
</p>
<p>reached your hands. Yesterday news came here that
</p>
<p>would seem to prejudice the liberty of America as well as
</p>
<p>that of its neighbors, and it is a matter which demands
</p>
<p>our utmost attention. Colonel Burr, ex-Vice-President,
</p>
<p>has placed himself at the head of 20,000 men under the
</p>
<p>pretext of revolutionizing and separating the States of
</p>
<p>the West from the rest of the Union. And it is further
</p>
<p>stated that the members of Congress from Kentucky,
</p>
<p>Tennessee, and Carolina have withdrawn from Congress.
</p>
<p>Various officers here with whom I have talked over the
</p>
<p>matter say that they believe Burr is in conspiracy with
</p>
<p>Miranda, who continues to harass the coast of Caracas.
</p>
<p>Since England is behind him, it is likely they may direct
</p>
<p>an attack against the Mexican coast, and as Burr is in
</p>
<p>communication with them he may march to their assist
</p>
<p>ance with the troops under him and many others which
</p>
<p>he can command.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>When we consider that these letters of Cortez were
</p>
<p>written a month before Blennerhassett fled from his

<p>public mind was agitated. Society was prepared to be
</p>
<p>lieve anything, and waited nervously for some emphatic,
</p>
<p>explicit denunciation. Wilkinson was the first one in
</p>
<p>authority to raise his voice ; and when he spoke through
</p>
<p>the mouth of Jefferson of damnable conspiracy, to the
</p>
<p>rising commotion was added consternation. This,
</p>
<p>however, did not mark its height; Wilkinson had not
</p>
<p>as yet tested his powers.

<p>The General reached Natchez at noon November
</p>
<p>nth and repaired at once to the country seat of Major

<p>Minor a Spanish officer and wealthy planter where
</p>
<p>he found his invalid wife dying. The day following

</p>
<p>but the secret of which he had kept close within his

<p>have produced incalculable disaster :*

</p>
<p>repel the Spaniards, and whom he had a few days
</p>
<p>earlier praised for their sacrifices and patriotic services,
</p>
<p>was to be expected there was still some virtue in con

<p>sistency! But are we to believe he thought New Or

<p>leans seriously endangered? That conspirators to the
</p>
<p>number of seven thousand were actually concentrating
</p>
<p>to descend upon the city in the fashion of mediaeval
</p>
<p>robber-knights ?
</p>
<p>The day he wrote Claiborne he directed a long dis
</p>

<p>senger i 1
</p>
<p>&quot;Many circumstances have intervened since my last,
</p>
<p>confirmatory of the information received, and demonstra
</p>
<p>tive of a deep, dark, and wicked conspiracy. My doubts
</p>
<p>have ceased, and it is my opinion, that naught but an im

<p>may desolate these settlements, inflict a deep wound on

<p>our Republican politics, involve us in a foreign conflict,

<p>and shake the Government to its foundation. . . .
</p>

<p>gasconade not when I tell you that, in such a cause, I

<p>shall glory to give my life to the service of my country ;

<p>for I verily believe such an event is probable; because

</p>
<p>for the New Year were being received at the White
</p>
<p>House, dismounted at its door and delivered his letters
</p>
<p>to Jefferson. When he had opened them he exclaimed :
</p>
<p>&quot;Is Wilkinson sound in this business?&quot; Briggs replied
</p>
<p>that there was &quot;not the slightest doubt of it.&quot; 1 The
</p>
<p>equanimity of the President on the occasion was re
</p>
<p>markable. &quot;Is Wilkinson sound in this business?&quot; was
</p>
<p>in truth a feeble exclamation to utter over so drastic an
</p>
<p>exposure of a conspiracy at once formidable in force
</p>
<p>and execrable in its nature. But Wilkinson s honesty
</p>
<p>was suspected, and in consequence the President s
</p>
<p>course for a time was marked by colorless action. He
</p>
<p>could not yet bring himself to believe that a crisis in
</p>
<p>the affairs of the Union threatening its existence was
</p>
<p>actually arrived.
</p>
<p>At the moment Wilkinson wrote to Freeman in
</p>
<p>New Orleans to hasten the works of defense ; to Cush-
</p>
<p>ing to &quot;hurry, hurry&quot; ; to Claiborne that he was sur
</p>
<p>rounded by dangers of which he did not dream ; and to
</p>
<p>the President that a &quot;deep, dark, and wicked con

<p>shameful an undertaking as our history chronicles.
</p>
<p>When confronted with the fact of this expedition he

<p>replied that it went &quot;on grounds of public duty and pro

<p>fessional enterprise to attempt to penetrate the veil
</p>
<p>which concealed the topographical route to the City of

<p>fied the ruse.&quot; Hardly had Wilkinson finished his
</p>
<p>batch of official dispatches when he wrote on Novem
</p>
<p>ber 1 3th to Burling: 1
</p>
<p>&quot;I have reflected on your proposition respecting a
</p>
<p>purchase of mules ; I can see no impropriety in it ; but
</p>
<p>in turning the subject in my mind another of public im
</p>
<p>portance has struck me; this is to avail yourself of the
</p>
<p>present alarm produced by Colonel Burr s projects to
</p>
<p>effect a visit to the city of Mexico by the interior, and to
</p>
<p>return by water in order to examine both routes, relative
</p>
<p>to their practicability and the means of defense the Span
</p>
<p>iards possess. I have long been in quest of this informa
</p>
<p>tion, but have not succeeded to my satisfaction and deem
</p>
<p>it at the present posture of public affairs highly interest
</p>
<p>ing to our country. If you can combine this object with
</p>
<p>your private views, I will frame instructions for you and
</p>
<p>will give you a formal passport out of our territories, with
</p>
<p>express authority to proceed to Mexico for the purpose
</p>
<p>of advising the viceroy of Burr s meditated designs.&quot;
</p>
<p>It is evident from this that the matter of Burling s
</p>
<p>Mexican trip had been discussed and settled before they
</p>
<p>reached Natchez perhaps long before. The proposi
</p>
<p>tion of buying mules was most ludicrous, and was
</p>
<p>nothing more than a trifling subterfuge. The trans
</p>
<p>parency of the illicit undertaking as well as its maturity
</p>
<p>appears in Burling s reply, which came the ensuing
</p>
<p>day: 2
</p>
<p>&quot;I received your favor late last evening and in reply
</p>
<p>inform you that I am disposed to forward your views by
</p>
<p>my best endeavors, provided I can do so without exposing
</p>
<p>myself to the risk of a dungeon or a Spanish mine. On
</p>
<p>the subject of the mules, I have made my determinations

<p>and shall set out in a few days..&quot;

<p>1 66 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>The levity with which the matter was treated is re
</p>
<p>markable, so cocksure of success were these enterpris
</p>
<p>ing patriots. The General wrote immediately to con
</p>
<p>gratulate Mr. Burling, wishing him a successful jour
</p>
<p>ney, and inclosing the following passport : l
</p>
<p>&quot;To all persons whom it may concern: Whereas,
</p>
<p>Aaron Burr at the head of a powerful combination of
</p>
<p>lawless citizens of the United States, in violation of the
</p>
<p>laws of said states and without the privity of the govern
</p>
<p>ment, is preparing to carry on an expedition into the
</p>
<p>territory of his Catholic Majesty, who is at peace with
</p>
<p>the United States, I have thought proper, agreeably to the
</p>
<p>principles of good faith, and to exonerate my government
</p>
<p>from a suspicion of participating in this design, to author
</p>
<p>ize the bearer hereof, Walter Burling, to pass all guards
</p>
<p>and garrisons of the United States and to proceed to the
</p>
<p>City of Mexico, for the purpose of handing to the viceroy
</p>
<p>a detailed report of said Burr s plans and designs.&quot;
</p>
<p>This passport stands out in sharp contrast with the
</p>
<p>preceding letter to the President. Now the Burr pro
</p>
<p>ject is only &quot;an expedition into the territory of his
</p>
<p>Catholic Majesty.&quot; The two documents varied with
</p>
<p>the necessities of the case.
</p>
<p>Wilkinson s good friend Stephen Minor, who still
</p>
<p>held his Spanish commission, also lent Burling a safe
</p>
<p>guard. His motive for so doing will probably never be
</p>
<p>known. He might have been in the secret, but the
</p>
<p>chances are that he was grossly deceived, that out of
</p>
<p>a desire to serve his country he unwittingly protected
</p>
<p>Burling on his mercenary mission.
</p>
<p>&quot;I, Stephen Minor,&quot; read the passport, dated Natchez,

<p>solicit the commanders and governors of the Internal
</p>
<p>Provinces of the Kingdom of Mexico to pass Walter Bur

<p>ling to the City of Mexico on business of the royal service.
</p>
<p>I beg and supplicate of each that you will supply him
</p>
<p>with the necessary auxiliaries, so that he may arrive early
</p>
<p>at his destination.&quot;
</p>
<p>Thus fortified, and with a long dispatch for the
</p>
<p>Viceroy, Burling set out for the capital of New Spain,
</p>
<p>and before the end of November presented himself at
</p>
<p>the Spanish camp near Nacogdoches. December ist,
</p>
<p>Herrera sent an account of the interview to Governor
</p>
<p>Cordero, who had returned to San Antonio de Bexar i 1
</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday, General Wilkinson s aide-de-camp, Wal
</p>
<p>ter Burling, presented himself at this place with a pass
</p>
<p>port and a letter closed and sealed for the Viceroy of
</p>
<p>these dominions of Spain, written as it expressed, by Don
</p>
<p>Estevan Minor; and Burling further stated that he had
</p>
<p>orders from his General to bear to Mexico to his Excel
</p>
<p>lency, the Viceroy, which were of the utmost importance
</p>
<p>concerning the security of the Kingdom. Upon my giving
</p>
<p>my word of honor to the aide-de-camp, I have learned the
</p>
<p>details of the General s letter to the Viceroy which only
</p>
<p>confirms what I wrote you the i8th, iQth, and 2oth of
</p>
<p>last month relative to the embryo revolution in the United
</p>
<p>States, with its hostile designs toward the Kingdom of
</p>
<p>Mexico. In order to allay suspicions I have made it
</p>
<p>public that they come here to buy mules and horses in
</p>
<p>this province of the kingdom, agreeably to the harmony
</p>
<p>which now exists between us and Wilkinson. In order

<p>that they may go securely, I have dispatched Captain

<p>Kingdom. Burling did not wish to pass through this
</p>
<p>plrice [Nacogdoches], for fear some one would write of
</p>
<p>his mission ; so, I directed him by the road to Bahia del
</p>
<p>Espiritu Santo.&quot;
</p>
<p>From this it is obvious that Burling was given
</p>
<p>every assistance in his long overland trip through the
</p>
<p>provinces of Mexico. That he was on any other busi
</p>
<p>ness than that set forth in his passports seems never
</p>
<p>to have been suspected. The deception of the Spanish
</p>
<p>officers was complete.
</p>
<p>Iturrigaray, the ill-starred Viceroy, knew of the
</p>
<p>approach of Burling and wrote January 20, 1807, to
</p>
<p>Cevallos that General Wilkinson had sent him an aide-
</p>
<p>de-camp. &quot;He brings me messages which I suppose
</p>
<p>must be concerning the designs of the ex-Vice-Presi-
</p>
<p>dent Burr.&quot; 1 A few days later Burling indeed rode
</p>
<p>into the City of Mexico and delivered his dispatches,
</p>
<p>and, before the end of February, 1807, returned to
</p>
<p>the General in New Orleans. March I2th Iturrigaray
</p>
<p>wrote from Xalapa to the Spanish Minister of State,
</p>
<p>dealing with Wilkinson s communications, which ex
</p>
<p>posed the movements and intentions of Burr. The
</p>
<p>Viceroy goes into detail in this extraordinarily impor
</p>
<p>tant message.
</p>
<p>&quot;In my letter of January, 2Oth ult.,&quot; Iturrigaray be
</p>
<p>gan, 2 &quot;I said among other things, that I had notice of
</p>
<p>the approach of an aide-de-camp from the American Gen

</p>
<p>arrived in fact, and delivered to me the General s letter,
</p>
<p>a copy of which I inclose to you. In it you will see that
</p>
<p>he lays great stress on the measures which he has taken
</p>
<p>at the risk of his life, fame, and fortune in order to save,
</p>
<p>or at least to protect this Kingdom from the attacks of the
</p>
<p>insurgents. He calls my attention with extraordinary
</p>
<p>emphasis to Vera Cruz and its coasts as the point of
</p>
<p>attack ; even indicating that the bandits, as he calls them,
</p>
<p>might have reached the City of Mexico. He finally
</p>
<p>comes to what I had anticipated, the question of payment
</p>
<p>for his services. He asks for $85,000 in one sum, and
</p>
<p>$26,000 in another. But, not content with this, he says
</p>
<p>he considers it just and equitable to be reimbursed for
</p>
<p>those sums he has been obliged to spend in order to sus
</p>
<p>tain the cause of good government, order, and humanity.
</p>
<p>Understanding the desires of the General I destroyed his
</p>
<p>letter, after it had been translated, in the presence of his
</p>
<p>aide-de-camp, whose conversation with me did not for
</p>
<p>ward the demands of his General, nor add anything to the
</p>
<p>information I had of the intentions of Colonel Burr. In
</p>
<p>my answer to the General I gave him to understand that
</p>
<p>the revolutionists had not caused me any alarm ; for I had
</p>
<p>been long prepared to repel them by force, even though
</p>
<p>their numbers had been much greater. I informed him
</p>
<p>that I could not pay the sums of money asked without
</p>
<p>definite orders from the King; and that I had arranged
</p>
<p>for the hasty return of his aide. In conclusion I thanked
</p>
<p>him for his martial zeal, and insinuated that I wished him
</p>
<p>happiness in the pursuit of his righteous intentions.
</p>
<p>From here the aide-de-camp went to Vera Cruz, from
</p>
<p>which port he sailed in the American schooner Liberty,
</p>
<p>for New Orleans, February loth, accompanied by his
</p>
<p>interpreter and servants.&quot;

<p>This document speaks for itself. It is the key which
</p>
<p>unlocks the cipher of Wilkinson s conduct in the
</p>
<p>month of November, 1806 the month witnessing the
</p>
<p>establishment of the Neutral Ground Treaty, the accu

<p>sation of Burr, and the appearance of the Proclamation.

<p>170 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>The crisis of the conspiracy came with the culmination
</p>
<p>of the Spanish affair on the Sabine; indeed at this
</p>
<p>point the crises were merged, were as inseparable as
</p>
<p>substance and shadow. If the conspiracy were not the
</p>
<p>shadow, it flourished only in the shadow of the Spanish
</p>
<p>War agitation.
</p>
<p>r We are now in a position better to estimate the
</p>
<p>sincerity and unselfishness of General Wilkinson. From
</p>
<p>the moment Herrera evacuated Bayou Pierre, Septem
</p>
<p>ber 27, 1806, James Wilkinson had nothing in common
</p>
<p>with Dayton, Burr, and the rest. It was no longer in
</p>
<p>his power to compel the war ; Burr and his confederates
</p>
<p>were making ready for their descent of the river; the
</p>
<p>country at large was every day becoming more annoyed
</p>
<p>and alarmed at the preparations for the expedition ; the
</p>
<p>press viciously assailed both himself and Burr, who
</p>
<p>were declared in league for the express purpose of
</p>
<p>establishing a Western empire all of which convinced
</p>
<p>Wilkinson that now was the time to establish that
</p>
<p>&quot;honorable fame,&quot; and to acquire at a stroke that for
</p>
<p>tune which he prized for its &quot;immediate utility only&quot; !
</p>
<p>To a man of his metal and genius it seemed much easier
</p>
<p>to turn the tide of public execration against Burr and
</p>
<p>his base confederates than to prove to the satisfac
</p>
<p>tion of the courts, after Burr s arrival, that they had
</p>
<p>not all of them been guilty of a high misdemeanor. So
</p>
<p>he decided to raise the cry which was to echo for a
</p>
<p>century &quot;Treason in the West.&quot; Viewed in the light
</p>
<p>of his representation of the conspiracy to the Viceroy,
</p>
<p>his alarming letters to the President appear somewhat

<p>CHAPTER VII.
</p>
<p>The Two Arraignment* of Burr in Kentucky
</p>
<p>*
</p>
<p>WHILE the inhabitants of Frankfort, Ken
</p>
<p>tucky, were celebrating the Fourth of July
</p>
<p>(1806) there appeared on the streets of the
</p>
<p>city the first issue of a weekly newspaper entitled the
</p>
<p>Western World. It is never possible to estimate the
</p>
<p>influence of a force in a community ; but the Western
</p>
<p>World played no small part in fixing in the minds of
</p>
<p>the people the idea of treason in the conspiracy. This
</p>
<p>was accomplished by instilling new life into the old
</p>
<p>intrigues and treasons which had played a part in Ken
</p>
<p>tucky politics, especially the Spanish Association which
</p>
<p>had owed everything to Wilkinson. The case made out
</p>
<p>against the Spanish conspirators was too strong to
</p>
<p>be resisted many authentic documents were printed
</p>
<p>which could not be controverted. Judge Sebastian,
</p>
<p>formerly associated with Wilkinson, resigned as judge
</p>
<p>of the Court of Appeals of the State before the commit
</p>
<p>tee appointed by the Legislature to investigate his con
</p>
<p>duct could make a report. The attack on Wilkinson
</p>
<p>led by the Western World was most scathing and vin
</p>
<p>dictive. But the General was beyond reach. He was
</p>
<p>aware, however, that he had been branded a pensioner
</p>
<p>of Spain, and had himself months earlier taken up the
</p>
<p>controversy in the press from his station in St. Louis.
</p>
<p>He had written the President, too, that he feared his
</p>
<p>faith in him might be shaken by those vile calumnies

<p>Here was a vital source of suspicions and misunder

<p>despite their wishes, the truth of the allegations of

<p>Wood figured and lost heavily in the confidence of the

<p>failed to receive the recognition which his ability as a

</p>
<p>but the life of the new publication was Wood, for upon
</p>
<p>his withdrawal, after the second trial of Burr in Ken
</p>
<p>tucky, the World ceased to exist.
</p>
<p>The initial number of the periodical contained the
</p>
<p>first of a series of articles by Marshall on the &quot;Spanish
</p>
<p>Association.&quot; As an apology for the introduction of
</p>
<p>the subject at so late a date, it was asserted that the
</p>
<p>seeds of it were only dormant, and that, if it were suf
</p>
<p>fered to spring up, dire consequences would result. To
</p>
<p>this startling assertion the Palladium, the official organ
</p>
<p>of the Government, took immediate exception. It dis
</p>
<p>countenanced the whole affair, declaring that the time
</p>
<p>had passed when there was cause for fear; the people
</p>
<p>of Kentucky were not to be drawn away by chimerical
</p>
<p>schemes; their devotion to the Union was as ardent
</p>
<p>and sincere as that of any other portion of its citizens. 1
</p>
<p>From the first the task the Western World set for
</p>
<p>itself was of the most sensational character. Three
</p>
<p>topics were designed for discussion: i. The Kentucky
</p>
<p>Spanish Association; 2. Blount s conspiracy; 3. The
</p>
<p>Miranda Expedition. 2 The first article on the Spanish
</p>
<p>Association roused the most heated controversies and
</p>
<p>recriminations. Street, ignoring a challenge from
</p>
<p>George Adams, was posted as, a poltroon, and was
</p>
<p>later openly assaulted. Abuse; however, did not affect
</p>
<p>the sale of the World, and by the middle of August it
</p>
<p>boasted a subscription list of one thousand a large

<p>Hunter, was straightway accused of having been bribed
</p>
<p>by the conspirators. 1 Wood and Marshall in their
</p>
<p>spirited attacks on the Spanish Association, and the
</p>
<p>enterprise of Blount kept Burr s name always in view ;
</p>
<p>he was connected in this way with the men who were
</p>
<p>remembered as having entertained ideas which favored
</p>
<p>the incorporation of the States west of the Alleghany
</p>
<p>Mountains with some foreign power. Before the mid
</p>
<p>dle of September, while Wilkinson was en route for
</p>
<p>Natchitoches to repel the Spaniards, with the President
</p>
<p>outwardly blinking at a war, Wood was revealing the
</p>
<p>secrets of the new project to an over-expectant public :
</p>
<p>&quot;The original design of the Kentucky Spanish Asso
</p>
<p>ciation has been entirely abandoned. The views of the
</p>
<p>conspirators are no longer to unite with Spain, but to
</p>
<p>form Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, the Louisia-
</p>
<p>nas, and the Floridas into one independent government.
</p>
<p>The advocates for this measure differ, however, in one
</p>
<p>point. The majority are for effecting this measure by
</p>
<p>calling a convention of the people and obtaining the con
</p>
<p>sent of Congress; but a considerable number, and par

<p>ticularly those who at present reside in the Western Terri

</p>
<p>This sensational paragraph, as the editors afterward
</p>
<p>confessed under oath, had no other foundation than the
</p>
<p>gossip of the hour. Nevertheless it wrought mischief
</p>
<p>of incalculable degree. That the World, printed at the
</p>
<p>capital of Kentucky, should calmly discourse of treason

<p>was warrant enough for the East, remote and isolated

<p>by barriers of nature, to credit reports verging on mad-

<p>their wills. &quot;The existence of such a conspiracy at the

<p>however politic it may be deemed to pretend so.&quot; The

<p>Lexington Gazette scorned the assertion that the Span

<p>ardently attached to the Union as the inhabitants of any

<p>section of it. We have evidence that the most remote

<p>justly viewing it as the most dreadful evil which could

<p>befall them.&quot; 2 But this was not the view in every

<p>quarter. &quot;In a recent issue of the Philadelphia Ga

<p>the idea of a separation from the Union/ It was

<p>a ridiculous, insulting notion, commented Hunter, and

<p>to see &quot;such stuff&quot; in an Eastern journal occasioned no

<p>surprise, for only recently some of the papers in the

<p>Atlantic States had avowed that five thousand men

<p>attorney for the Federal district of Kentucky, this was
</p>
<p>particularly pleasing, for he had been sending to the
</p>
<p>President letter after letter concerning a conspiracy
</p>
<p>at least of some character.
</p>
<p>Before Graham, the President s agent of inquiry
</p>
<p>into the conduct of Burr, reached the Alleghanies,
</p>
<p>Daviess had accused Burr in the Federal court at
</p>
<p>Frankfort of having violated the laws of the Union in
</p>
<p>setting on foot an unauthorized expedition against
</p>
<p>Mexico. November 5th was the day, a day likewise
</p>
<p>memorable as the date for the establishment of the Neu
</p>
<p>tral Ground Treaty. Whether the prosecution was ani
</p>
<p>mated fay Daviess s Federalist affiliations, or by a de
</p>
<p>sire to profit at the cost of the humiliation of Burr s
</p>
<p>eager followers, who were Republicans and leaders of
</p>
<p>State politics, cannot be determined. &quot;Daviess insti
</p>
<p>tuted the first proceedings against him,&quot; recorded Blen-
</p>
<p>nerhassett in his Journal, 1 &quot;partly from a sense of neg

<p>lect on the part of Burr, and through enmity to the
</p>
<p>President, who he fully believed was concerned with
</p>
<p>Burr, or connived at his operations.&quot; This was written
</p>
<p>on the strength of a confession of John Wood, the
</p>
<p>sometime editor of the Western World, and the confi

<p>dant of Marshall and Daviess; and who, Blennerhas-
</p>
<p>sett wrote, had come to Richmond to lend his assistance
</p>
<p>in righting some of the wrongs he himself had aided
</p>
<p>in inflicting on Burr. Daviess s pamphlet entitled, A

<p>that it was not patriotic zeal which spurred him to
</p>
<p>bring Burr into court.
</p>
<p>A compulsory process was moved before Judge
</p>
<p>Innes of the Federal court against Aaron Burr ; a sec
</p>
<p>ond, for compelling the attendance of witnesses. The
</p>
<p>accused, who was at Lexington when he heard of this
</p>
<p>proceeding, quietly sent a messenger to say that he
</p>
<p>would appear on Saturday ; then, knowing that the news
</p>
<p>would reach Blennerhassett greatly magnified, he wrote
</p>
<p>him that he had been charged with treasonable practice
</p>
<p>of some description; that he did not know how the
</p>
<p>charge was supported; that since the grand jury had
</p>
<p>made no investigation he presumed the motion had
</p>
<p>been made to influence public opinion. He concluded
</p>
<p>by assuring his associate that there was no cause for
</p>
<p>anxiety as to the outcome. 1
</p>
<p>Burr reached Frankfort Friday ; and Saturday ap

<p>ination. After the grand jury was impaneled, court
</p>
<p>adjourned to the next Wednesday to allow time for

<p>the summoning of witnesses. &quot;The event spread
</p>
<p>rapidly throughout the country, generally mingled with

<p>to order, and as the charge was about to be delivered
</p>
<p>to the grand jury Daviess rose and asked for its dis
</p>
<p>charge, saying that he could not proceed since one of
</p>
<p>his witnesses, Davis Floyd of Indiana, was absent. 1
</p>
<p>The investigation was accordingly adjourned.
</p>
<p>The affair was roundly ridiculed by the crowd.
</p>
<p>Daviess had sworn out a compulsory process to bring
</p>
<p>Burr into court; Burr had voluntarily appeared, and,
</p>
<p>to the confusion of the attorney, demanded an exami
</p>
<p>nation which he was not brave enough to attempt. This
</p>
<p>was peculiarly hard for the prosecutor as there was no
</p>
<p>legitimate excuse for adopting such tactics. What is
</p>
<p>more, his knowledge of Burr s project extended over
</p>
<p>months; and one would have thought, recalling his
</p>
<p>letters to the President, that there was no detail that
</p>
<p>had not been considered. The Palladium referred as
</p>
<p>follows to the incident of the trial : 2
</p>
<p>&quot;Colonel Burr has throughout this business conducted
</p>
<p>himself with the calmness, moderation, and firmness
</p>
<p>which have characterized him through life. He evinced
</p>
<p>an earnest desire for a full and speedy investigation free
</p>
<p>from irritation or emotion ; he excited the strongest sen
</p>
<p>sation of respect and friendship in the breast of every
</p>
<p>impartial person present.&quot;
</p>
<p>If Hunter could print such a paragraph, it is the
</p>
<p>more interesting to contrast the account of Street and
</p>
<p>Wood, who, now that Burr was actually accused, hast
</p>
<p>ened to give publicity to the most astounding tales.

<p>180 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>aware that the field of conjecture will be traveled in
</p>
<p>every direction by the curious reader and inquisitive poli
</p>
<p>tician. With ourselves, we confess it has excited neither
</p>
<p>astonishment nor surprise, being, as we before mentioned,
</p>
<p>well informed of the subject eighteen months ago. This
</p>
<p>was the business which we purposed to unfold under the
</p>
<p>head of the Miranda Expedition. The expedition was
</p>
<p>only a very inferior part of the scheme, and Miranda him
</p>
<p>self an inferior agent in the plan. From the steps which
</p>
<p>have been taken by the public attorney, we now think it
</p>
<p>improper to enter into a detail of the conspiracy, being
</p>
<p>assured that he is in possession of all the information of
</p>
<p>which we are; and that he is a much more proper instru
</p>
<p>ment than the editors of a newspaper to prevent its
</p>
<p>accomplishment. The project of Colonel Burr is doubt
</p>
<p>less of the most extensive nature, and if accomplished will
</p>
<p>not only affect the interests of the Western country, but
</p>
<p>of the known world. A revolution in the Spanish prov
</p>
<p>inces of North America will speedily, when aided by Mi
</p>
<p>randa, lead to one in South America, and the whole, along
</p>
<p>with the Western States of the Union organized into one
</p>
<p>empire, headed by a man of the enterprise and talents of
</p>
<p>Colonel Burr, will present a phenomenon in the political
</p>
<p>history of the globe perhaps only equaled by the modern
</p>
<p>Empire of France.&quot;
</p>
<p>A paragraph of more startling political significance,
</p>
<p>so far as the New World is concerned, has perhaps
</p>
<p>never appeared in print. Even earlier than this the
</p>
<p>exaggerated statements of the World had spread over
</p>
<p>the country, becoming ever further from the truth.
</p>
<p>The fact that settlements and States were isolated, and
</p>
<p>that men might be collected and boats constructed and
</p>
<p>such details not become matters of public notoriety,

<p>placed things in a delicate position. And then Street
</p>
<p>and Wood fortified their former declarations with an

<p>actual account of Burr s denunciation by Daviess, infus-

</p>
<p>ing new life into their statements by the declaration
</p>
<p>that they had absolute evidence of Burr s complicity in
</p>
<p>the plot to effect a disruption of the Union; and that
</p>
<p>they would have exposed this scheme, too, had they
</p>
<p>not been anticipated by the fast march of events.
</p>
<p>Not the least of the evil effects resulting from their
</p>
<p>publications was the lamentable impression which
</p>
<p>spread throughout the nation concerning the loyalty
</p>
<p>of the Westerners. So sensational were the charges,
</p>
<p>so prominent were the characters involved and so por
</p>
<p>tentous were the proportions of the projected con
</p>
<p>spiracy, that the articles were copied everywhere and
</p>
<p>perused with morbid eagerness.
</p>
<p>&quot;A Kentucky paper called the Western World,&quot; said
</p>
<p>the editor of the National Intelligencer, &quot;attracts very
</p>
<p>great attention here ; among others Judge Prevost, Ed
</p>
<p>ward Livingston, General Wilkinson, Mr. Burr, Mr. John
</p>
<p>Brown of Kentucky are charged as concerned in a new
</p>
<p>conspiracy against the peace of the whole Union, and
</p>
<p>with meditating a separation of this section from the east

<p>ern parts of the Union. Many people here are acquainted

<p>with the old conspiracy of a similar kind concerted with
</p>
<p>the Spaniards and know the leading characters concerned
</p>
<p>in it, and many wonder how Wilkinson came to be ap
</p>
<p>pointed to the chief command of our forces.&quot;
</p>
<p>With marked demonstrations of approval the West
</p>
<p>celebrated the collapse of the Frankfort inquiry as a
</p>
<p>vindication of Burr, while Daviess, Marshall, and the
</p>
<p>Western World were left to chagrin. The district-

<p>1 82 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>&quot;The genuine Republicans left no efforts unemployed
</p>
<p>to injure me; and every one of these Espanolized Ken-
</p>
<p>tuckians, not one excepted, were Burr s friends and my
</p>
<p>persecutor. The people seemed to vie with each other in
</p>
<p>folly and a zeal to distinguish and caress this persecuted
</p>
<p>patriot. . . . The secretary told me the governor
</p>
<p>laughed at the idea of Mr. Burr s expedition
</p>
<p>You remark in history that there are times in which
</p>
<p>whole nations are blind ; this seemed to me to be one.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>The Frankfort episode in no wise interrupted the
</p>
<p>preparations of the conspirator. Blennerhassett had
</p>
<p>encountered no impediment, and already Andrew Jack
</p>
<p>son had received three thousand dollars in Kentucky
</p>
<p>bank notes with orders for the construction of five
</p>
<p>boats. Jackson was also to purchase supplies, enlist
</p>
<p>recruits, and in every way prepare for the expedition
</p>
<p>which was to float down the Cumberland in December;
</p>
<p>and no time was lost in undertaking the fulfillment of
</p>
<p>his instructions. Burr again appeared in Cincinnati in
</p>
<p>company with John Smith. He was now doubtless
</p>
<p>shown Wilkinson s letter of October from Natchitoches
</p>
<p>in which he appealed to the Senator to come to his as
</p>
<p>sistance, and in which he outlined the needs and the

<p>course to be pursued in the conquest of Mexico. 2 But
</p>
<p>Burr and Smith were not aware that Wilkinson had
</p>
<p>already denounced them to the President ; that the Gov

<p>ernment s agent, Graham, was on the Ohio; and that

<p>the General was leisurely making his way to New Or

<p>the following statement as embodying in substance

<p>Burr s communications to him the language is Burr s
</p>
<p>and it is the most explicit enunciation we have of his
</p>
<p>concerning the nature of the project : x
</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Smith, my object in a few months will be dis
</p>
<p>closed, you will not find it dishonorable or inimical to this
</p>
<p>Government. I feel superior to the mean artifices which
</p>
<p>are ascribed to me. Calumniators I do not notice, for as
</p>
<p>fast as you put one down another will rise up. This
</p>
<p>much I will tell you, if there should be a war between the
</p>
<p>United States and Spain, I shall head a corps of volun
</p>
<p>teers and be the first to march into the Mexican provinces.
</p>
<p>If peace should be proffered, which I do not expect, I shall

<p>settle my Washita lands, and make society as pleasant as
</p>
<p>possible. In this Government I have been persecuted,
</p>
<p>shamefully persecuted ; and I am sorry to say, that in it,
</p>
<p>all private confidence is destroyed.&quot;

</p>
<p>wrote November 27th to Governor Harrison of the

<p>Northwest Territory :*
</p>
<p>&quot;Considering the various and extravagant reports
</p>
<p>which circulate concerning me, it may not be unsatisfac
</p>
<p>tory to you to be informed (and to you there can be no
</p>
<p>better source of information than myself) that I have
</p>
<p>no wish or design to attempt a separation of the Union,
</p>
<p>that I have no connection with any foreign power or
</p>
<p>government, that I never meditated the introduction of
</p>
<p>any foreign power or influence into the United States,
</p>
<p>or any part of its territories, but on the contrary should
</p>
<p>repel with indignation any proposition or measure having
</p>
<p>that tendency; in fine, that I have no project or views
</p>
<p>hostile to the interest, or tranquillity, or union of the
</p>
<p>United States, or prejudicial to its government; and I
</p>
<p>pledge you my honor for the truth of this declaration.
</p>
<p>It is true that I am engaged in an extensive speculation,
</p>
<p>and that with me are associated some of your intimate
</p>
<p>and dearest friends. The objects are such as every man
</p>
<p>of honor and every good citizen must approve. They
</p>
<p>have been communicated to several of the principal offi
</p>
<p>cers of our government, particularly to one high in the
</p>
<p>confidence of the Administration. Indeed, from the
</p>
<p>nature of them it cannot be otherwise.&quot;
</p>
<p>While in Louisville, November 2jth the very day

<p>have the jury summoned for the session of the next

<p>Tuesday. Subpoenas were issued for witnesses, and
</p>
<p>all was made ready for the trial. 1 Burr reached Frank

</p>
<p>concerning his project : 2

<p>promote a dissolution of the Union, or a separation of any

</p>
<p>or with my knowledge. . . . Considering the high

<p>station you now fill in our national councils, I have
</p>
<p>thought these explanations proper, as well to counteract
</p>
<p>the chimerical tales, which malevolent persons have so
</p>
<p>industriously circulated, as to satisfy you that you have

<p>not espoused the cause of a man in any way unfriendly to

<p>1 86 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>&quot;It seems that we have been much mistaken about
</p>
<p>Burr. When I left Kentucky, I believed him both an
</p>
<p>innocent and persecuted man. In the course of my jour
</p>
<p>ney to this place, still entertaining that opinion, I ex
</p>
<p>pressed myself without reserve, and it seems owing to
</p>
<p>the freedom of my sentiments at Chillicothe I have
</p>
<p>exposed myself to the strictures of some anonymous
</p>
<p>writer of that place. They give me no uneasiness, as I
</p>
<p>am sensible that all my friends and acquaintances know
</p>
<p>me incapable of entering into the views of Burr. It
</p>
<p>appears from the President s message to Congress, in
</p>
<p>answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives,
</p>
<p>calling for information, that Burr had formed the no less
</p>
<p>daring projects than to reduce New Orleans, subjugate
</p>
<p>Mexico, and divide the Union/
</p>
<p>Every act of Clay s splendid career protests against
</p>
<p>the statement which we find too often made that he,
</p>
<p>like Smith and Jackson, sought only a cover for his
</p>
<p>credulity. Some have written only too clearly that
</p>
<p>that satisfied he had no scruple against appearing in
</p>
<p>court in order to thwart a process of justice and to
</p>
<p>preserve a traitor.
</p>
<p>December 2d court met pursuant to adjournment.
</p>
<p>Judge Innes read his charge to the grand jury in due
</p>
<p>form and with emphasis as to the necessity for a rigid
</p>
<p>investigation to be made into the conduct of certain
</p>
<p>revolutionary characters. The same day the jury filed
</p>
<p>back into court to say that they had no presentments
</p>
<p>to make, and that the district-attorney had preferred no
</p>
<p>indictments to them. Daviess then moved that the
</p>
<p>grand jury be adjourned until ten o clock on the fol
</p>
<p>lowing day when he would file indictments. He took
</p>
<p>occasion to say that &quot;Burr s presence was not required

</p>
<p>and that it appeared rather ostentatious than useful or
</p>
<p>TWO KENTUCKY ARRAIGNMENTS 187
</p>
<p>proper.&quot; Clay and Allen, acting for the defendant,
</p>
<p>replied that the grand jury after being sworn and
</p>
<p>charged could meet when it pleased, and retorted that
</p>
<p>the presence of their client in court was entirely proper.
</p>
<p>Wednesday, when court had been called, Daviess
</p>
<p>presented a paper to the foreman, saying, &quot;This is an
</p>
<p>indictment against Senator John Adair.&quot; He next in
</p>
<p>sisted before the court that he should have the right to
</p>
<p>go before the grand jury to question the witnesses. This
</p>
<p>contention involved a fundamental principle in the
</p>
<p>practice of the courts and provoked a heated discussion,
</p>
<p>Clay and Allen denying the existence of such a right.
</p>
<p>They argued that if the prosecution were correct, then
</p>
<p>must the defense also have representation ; and that the
</p>
<p>logic of this meant the conversion of the grand jury
</p>
<p>into a trial court. Daviess at once accused Burr of
</p>
<p>wishing to thwart the examination. Burr replied that
</p>
<p>when he had first heard that a charge was about to be
</p>
<p>exhibited against him he had hastened to present him
</p>
<p>self before the court; that now a second time he had
</p>
<p>appeared without compulsory process, and that he had
</p>
<p>even aided the prosecutor in procuring witnesses; he
</p>
<p>desired an investigation and hoped that it would be
</p>
<p>satisfactory, but trusted that it would be conducted
</p>
<p>according to the established rules of law. Judge Innes
</p>
<p>decided that the contention of the prosecution was un
</p>
<p>founded.
</p>
<p>Thursday Daviess remarked that he had prepared
</p>
<p>some special sets of questions which he desired the
</p>
<p>grand jury to use in the examination of certain wit

</p>
<p>nesses. To this request, though somewhat irregular,
</p>
<p>1 88 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>both Burr and Adair readily assented. Then the in
</p>
<p>quiry proceeded, but the suspense was not of long
</p>
<p>duration ; the jury soon reported the indictment against
</p>
<p>John Adair, &quot;Not a true bill.&quot; The substance of the
</p>
<p>indictment read that August i, 1806, John Adair of
</p>
<p>Mercer County did arm and set on foot an unlawful
</p>
<p>expedition against the Spanish Kingdom of Mexico,
</p>
<p>against the peace and dignity of the United States. It
</p>
<p>I is interesting to find that no reference is made to a
</p>
<p>project to revolutionize the States west of the Alle-
</p>
<p>ghanies. When the report of the foreman had been
</p>
<p>registered, Daviess formally preferred an indictment
</p>
<p>against Aaron Burr :
</p>
<p>&quot;United States of America, Kentucky District, to wit :
</p>
<p>The grand jury of the United States in and for the body
</p>
<p>of the said district, do on their oaths present, that a cer
</p>
<p>tain Aaron Burr, late of the city of New York and vice-
</p>
<p>president of the United States, did with force and arms
</p>
<p>at the county of Fayette in said district, on the 25th day
</p>
<p>of November last past wilfully and unlawfully, and from
</p>
<p>evil premeditation, then and there set on foot and prepare
</p>
<p>for a military expedition against the dominions of the
</p>
<p>King of Spain, who is an European friend, at peace with
</p>
<p>the said United States, to wit against the provinces of
</p>
<p>said King, in North America contrary to the laws of the
</p>
<p>United States in such cases provided, and against the
</p>
<p>peace and dignity thereof.&quot;
</p>
<p>Thus ran the first count in the indictment; there
</p>
<p>was another which alleged that on the day in question
</p>
<p>in the county of Jefferson a similar misdemeanor had
</p>
<p>been committed. No mention was made of treason in
</p>
<p>the indictment, though strangely enough Wilkinson
</p>
<p>had already begun his tales of treason in New Orleans,

</p>
<p>while Jefferson at Washington, through the General s
</p>
<p>TWO KENTUCKY ARRAIGNMENTS 189
</p>
<p>confidential communications, had been led to denounce
</p>
<p>in unqualified terms the threatening combinations
</p>
<p>forming on the Ohio. Though Daviess had not ven
</p>
<p>tured to charge Burr with treasonable practice, he had
</p>
<p>taken occasion to assert in court that such was also in
</p>
<p>contemplation. Therefore, Friday brought intense ex
</p>
<p>citement. The town of Frankfort was crowded with
</p>
<p>people who had come to attend the trial and to see the
</p>
<p>celebrities. Everywhere the conspiracy was the all-
</p>
<p>engrossing subject; but there were few who believed
</p>
<p>with Daviess that a terrible calamity was impending.
</p>
<p>Early in the day attention became centred in the action
</p>
<p>of the grand jury. Who were the witnesses? What
</p>
<p>would be the nature of the indictment? Excitement
</p>
<p>rose to a high pitch when witnesses were sent for whose
</p>
<p>names the ardent prosecutor for some reason best
</p>
<p>known to himself had failed to submit, notably Street
</p>
<p>and Wood. For months these editors had stirred the
</p>
<p>country with their versions of the Spanish Association
</p>
<p>and Blount s Enterprise, and had gone so far as to
</p>
<p>issue an address to the people :
</p>
<p>&quot;The editors of this paper are called on by William
</p>
<p>Littell and certain of the amiable youth of Frankfort, to
</p>
<p>produce proofs of what they allege about the conspira

<p>tors. Fellow citizens we will do no such thing. . . .
</p>
<p>If you will sue us for slander, we will plead justification.
</p>
<p>We will go into no paper war about it with William Littell,
</p>
<p>William Hunter, the two constellations of prostitution;
</p>
<p>or any of your hirelings. We will publish your guilt in
</p>
<p>print ; but we will enter into no dispute with any of you
</p>
<p>about it in print. And our Federalist friends have point
</p>
<p>edly advised us by no means to suffer. any of our evidence
</p>
<p>to be made known before it is called for in court.&quot; 1

</p>
<p>190 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>Daviess and Marshall were doubtless the Federalist
</p>
<p>friends and advisers who feared an inopportune ex
</p>
<p>posure of the testimony ; and it is therefore all the more
</p>
<p>inexplicable why the patriotic Daviess chose to let
</p>
<p>another occasion pass without giving the conspiracy a
</p>
<p>thorough airing. Moreover there had recently ap
</p>
<p>peared in the World a statement of the utmost import
</p>
<p>now that Burr was accused and the editors were to
</p>
<p>testify. The people remembered having read a declara
</p>
<p>tion to the effect that the editors were intimately in
</p>
<p>formed of all Colonel Burr s projects, which, at the
</p>
<p>proper time, they would lay before the public i 1
</p>
<p>&quot;No set of men are held in greater abhorrence,&quot; began
</p>
<p>the audacious paragraph, &quot;than the leaders of the Feder
</p>
<p>alist and Burr factions, or any faction whatever. There
</p>
<p>are Burrites, however, in the state of Kentucky, and we
</p>
<p>know them, but happily they are only to be found among
</p>
<p>the conspirators we are now exposing. We were well
</p>
<p>acquainted with the object of Colonel Burr s visit to the
</p>
<p>state of Kentucky before he left the city of Washington.
</p>
<p>We know the proceedings of his agents in this state, at
</p>
<p>Orleans and at St. Louis ; we are perfectly informed
</p>
<p>of the nature of his contract with General Wilkinson, as
</p>
<p>likewise the articles agreed to at Frankfort between him
</p>
<p>and Mr. John Brown. But these will be detailed in the
</p>
<p>concluding part of our narrative.&quot;
</p>
<p>The grand jury deemed this a very proper occasion
</p>
<p>for the disclosure of the &quot;narrative,&quot; and the crowd,
</p>
<p>eager and impatient, awaited its report. No one knew
</p>
<p>what testimony the implacable editors of the turbulent
</p>
<p>sheet might bring into court. Street was first called

<p>that he could give no information relative to the
</p>
<p>charges set forth ; that his knowledge had been derived
</p>
<p>wholly from hearsay ; that he knew no one who could
</p>
<p>testify in the case! The jury had called for a file of
</p>
<p>the Western World, and when John Wood was intro
</p>
<p>duced he was asked questions based upon paragraphs
</p>
<p>he had himself written. According to his own con
</p>
<p>fession in A Full Statement he was obliged to admit
</p>
<p>the falsity of the charges as well as the unfounded
</p>
<p>slanders which had been uttered. 1 Indeed he made
</p>
<p>bold to say that for some time he had been changing
</p>
<p>his mind concerning Burr, finishing with the amazing
</p>
<p>statement that he was persuaded Burr had no inten
</p>
<p>tions which antagonized the laws and interests of the
</p>
<p>United States ! 2 Such an admission was a fitting close
</p>
<p>to the investigations of the grand jury. The two men
</p>
<p>in the Western country who pretended to know all that
</p>
<p>was necessary to establish guilt, had attested on their
</p>
<p>oaths that they knew nothing. The other witnesses
</p>
<p>were in no better plight; so the jury filed in at two
</p>
<p>o clock and returned the indictment &quot;Not a true bill.&quot;
</p>
<p>Their labors were not ended, however; they felt that
</p>
<p>the prevailing excitement warranted their issuing a
</p>
<p>statement :
</p>
<p>&quot;The grand jury is happy to inform the court that no
</p>
<p>violent disturbance of the public tranquillity, or breach of
</p>
<p>laws has come to their knowledge. We have no hesita

</p>
<p>well on the charges against Burr, as those contained in the
</p>
<p>indictment preferred to us against John Adair, that there
</p>
<p>has been no testimony before us which does in the smallest
</p>
<p>degree criminate the conduct of either of those persons ;
</p>
<p>nor can we, from all the inquiries and investigation of the
</p>
<p>subject, discover that anything improper or injurious to
</p>
<p>the interest of the Government of the United States, or
</p>
<p>contrary to the laws thereof, is designed or contemplated
</p>
<p>by either of them.&quot;
</p>
<p>When the foreman, Abraham Kite, had finished the
</p>
<p>reading of the special report, the district-attorney said
</p>
<p>that there was nothing further, and thereupon the jury
</p>
<p>was dismissed. It was an agonizing moment for
</p>
<p>Daviess and his advisers it was a fate too well de
</p>
<p>served. Again Burr had been vindicated; once more
</p>
<p>the people applauded, and to show their apprecia
</p>
<p>tion they gave a grand ball in his honor. Daviess and
</p>
<p>his party attempted a counter fete which was a total
</p>
<p>failure. 1 As the report of the miserable fiasco of
</p>
<p>Daviess s accusation spread abroad the Westerners
</p>
<p>were reassured of the innocence of Burr s designs as
</p>
<p>respected the Union, but in some circles the result was
</p>
<p>accepted as proof of an illicit alliance between the con
</p>
<p>spirator and the people. To Jefferson it appeared that
</p>
<p>Burr owed his liberation to want of discretion and
</p>
<p>L
</p>
<p>details of the second trial have been presented in the
</p>
<p>belief that they were necessary to the rational study of the con
</p>
<p>spiracy. Another reason also appears it affords an opportunity
</p>
<p>for drawing a sharp parallel between contemporary writing and
</p>
<p>generally accepted conclusions. Henry Adams (iii., 282) says
</p>
<p>concerning the second arraignment of Burr, &quot;A second time the

<p>scene of outraged virtue was acted. Once more the witnesses

<p>vanished. Senator Smith saddled his horse and fled; Adair
</p>
<p>would not appear; and the judge lent his weight to the criminal.

<p>talent in Daviess, and the latter was accordingly re
</p>
<p>moved from office. At the moment Burr &quot;for whose
</p>
<p>honor and innocence,&quot; Clay said, &quot;he could pledge his
</p>
<p>own,&quot; felt the full tide of public favor, a tide which
</p>
<p>had already started on its receding course. That Burr
</p>
<p>was guilty of treasonable practices was not believed by
</p>
<p>the people of Kentucky; but that he meditated an en
</p>
<p>terprise against the dominions of a neighboring Prince,
</p>
<p>based on the contingency of a war, was asserted un
</p>
<p>hesitatingly. To prepare for an emergency, which was
</p>
<p>deemed unavoidable was no offense. Indeed, war was
</p>
<p>scarcely thought necessary to give license to the in

</p>
<p>later there were half a thousand Westerners who main

<p>tained so stoutly this belief that the hold of the Latin

<p>race on the great empire of Texas was loosed never to
</p>
<p>be regained. Amid all the rumors and accusations the

<p>people of the West were Burr s steadfast friends,
</p>
<p>never wavering under the charges of the Western

<p>of the Aurora and national political factor, counseled

<p>194 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>him as early as November 4th to take some step to
</p>
<p>counteract the public alarm. Rumors were in circula
</p>
<p>tion, he said, of dangerous disturbances in Kentucky. 1
</p>
<p>&quot;It might be of some importance,&quot; he suggested, &quot;by
</p>
<p>some means to settle the public feeling on the subject.
</p>
<p>The whole country will be with you if there is any actual
</p>
<p>emergency. If there is not, the Administration may de
</p>
<p>rive great advantage from a seasonable counteraction of
</p>
<p>the alarm.&quot;
</p>
<p>With Jefferson the season for allaying the alarm
</p>
<p>was slow in arriving. Yet all the while apart from
</p>
<p>the newspapers he had notices of the brewing storm.
</p>
<p>Five days later than Duane, Caesar A. Rodney, who
</p>
<p>was shortly to become Attorney-General, uttered his
</p>
<p>suspicions :*
</p>
<p>&quot;The aspect of affairs to the westward,&quot; said he to the
</p>
<p>President, &quot;is still unpleasant. The Spaniards give us
</p>
<p>most uneasiness, thQugh rumors on the subject of some
</p>
<p>secret conspiracy increase the public anxiety. I cannot
</p>
<p>give credence to these vague reports, nor can I believe
</p>
<p>there is a desperado in the United States capable of
</p>
<p>attempting the mad project of revolutionizing the West
</p>
<p>ern states.&quot;
</p>
<p>The President s view of the enterprise at that date
</p>
<p>was truly very singular. He simply said in reply
</p>
<p>to Duane, November 24th, the day before Wilkinson s
</p>
<p>special messenger galloped into Washington: &quot;In the
</p>
<p>western quarter great things have been meditated ; but
</p>
<p>they will probably end in an attempt upon the public
</p>
<p>lands, and the question will be whether we have author
</p>
<p>ity legally to oppose them with force.&quot; 3

<p>But Jefferson s opinion was suddenly and utterly
</p>
<p>changed by Wilkinson s revelations, which were de
</p>
<p>livered November 25th at the White House. 1 The
</p>
<p>Cabinet was summoned in haste. The record of its

</p>
<p>unwell. Despatches from General Wilkinson to myself
</p>
<p>of October 21, by a confidential officer (Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Smith) show that overtures have been made to him which
</p>
<p>decide that the present object of the combination is an
</p>
<p>expedition by sea against Vera Cruz ; and by comparing
</p>
<p>the contents of a letter from Cowles Meade to the Secre
</p>
<p>tary of State, with the information from Lieutenant Smith
</p>
<p>that a Mr. Swartwout from New York, brother of the
</p>
<p>late marshal, had been at General Wilkinson s camp, we
</p>
<p>are satisfied that Swartwout has been the agent through
</p>
<p>whom overtures have been made to Wilkinson. We came
</p>
<p>to the following determinations : That a proclamation be
</p>
<p>issued (see it), and that orders go as follows: to Pitts-
</p>
<p>burg, if we have a military officer there, write to him to
</p>
<p>be vigilant in order to discover whether there are any
</p>
<p>preparations making, or boats, or arms, or other military
</p>
<p>stores or means providing by any persons against whom
</p>
<p>there is reasonable ground to suspect that they have in

<p>contemplation a military enterprise against any of the
</p>
<p>territories of Spain (contrary to the statute, June 5, 1794,
</p>
<p>c. 50) ; to stop all bodies of armed men who may be
</p>
<p>assembled to descend the Ohio under circumstances and
</p>
<p>appearances so different from those of common emigrants
</p>
<p>as to induce a reasonable suspicion that they are part of

</p>
<p>and suspected to be destined for this enterprise, and to

<p>call in the aid of the militia. General Dearborne to write
</p>
<p>to Governor Tiffin to furnish a guard of militia, sufficient

<p>for the detention of the boats; and to write to General

<p>Jackson, supposed to be the General of the Brigade on the

<p>Virginia side of the river, to furnish any aid of militia
</p>
<p>which may be necessary from the left bank of the river.
</p>
<p>Louisville, General Dearborne to write to the Governor

<p>of Kentucky of the same tenor as to the officer at Pitts-

<p>Captain Bissell of the same tenor, and particularly to stop

<p>armed vessels suspected on good grounds to be proceed

<p>ing on this enterprise, and for this purpose to have in

<p>readiness any boats he can procure, fitted for enabling

<p>him to arrest their passage ; Chickasaw Bluffs, give

<p>same orders as to Bissell ; Fort Adams, ditto ; New

</p>
<p>conduct had been questioned in Cabinet council and that
</p>
<p>his dispatches were obviously double-faced, the Presi
</p>
<p>dent was ready to grant him the power he was to as
</p>
<p>sume on his own account in the Creole City. The
</p>
<p>TWO KENTUCKY ARRAIGNMENTS 197
</p>
<p>General could say in one letter that the expedition was
</p>
<p>directed against Mexico; in a second, possibly against
</p>
<p>the States; and could ask to be so empowered that he
</p>
<p>might direct the combination, even though traitorous,
</p>
<p>against the Spaniards and still the President with
</p>
<p>stoical blindness failed to penetrate the deception nay,
</p>
<p>contrariwise, read into the communications an hon
</p>
<p>est denunciation ! Forthwith the forces of the Govern
</p>
<p>ment were concentrated in an effort to overcome the
</p>
<p>dastardly conspirators on the strength of a vague ac
</p>
<p>cusation by the chief of the army who at the moment
</p>
<p>was entering New Orleans fresh from his venal Sabine
</p>
<p>campaign.
</p>
<p>The day after the Cabinet session,, orders were sent
</p>
<p>to Marietta to post one hundred and fifty or two hun
</p>
<p>dred militia on the river to prevent the passing out of
</p>
<p>Burr s &quot;gunboats.&quot; On the twenty-seventh Dearborn
</p>
<p>wrote Wilkinson : &quot;You will use every exertion in your

<p>their criminal enterprises; are organizing, officering, and

<p>such cases made and provided : I have therefore thought

<p>proper to issue this, my proclamation, warning and en

<p>due knowledge or consideration to participate in the said

<p>unlawful enterprise to withdraw from the same without

<p>delay.&quot;
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the civil and military officers of the
</p>
<p>United States and the faithful citizens were enjoined
</p>
<p>to be vigilant in suppressing the expedition; to seize
</p>
<p>the boats and arms, to give &quot;information against them

<p>to the proper authorities&quot; ; to bring the guilty to con

<p>tion the President hoped to defeat Burr, be his scheme

<p>what it might; and it seemed from Wilkinson s dis

<p>patches to be both treasonable and filibustering. But

<p>Jefferson had not the spirit to call it treasonable, al

<p>though there lurked in the urgent language an ill-dis

<p>guised reservation which the public at once interpreted

<p>as fraught with sinister meaning. Erskine, the Brit

</p>
<p>not reasonably to be supposed that Mr. Jefferson who
</p>
<p>has always pursued a temporizing line of conduct, in
</p>
<p>domestic politics and indeed toward all foreign nations
</p>
<p>except Great Britain, should have adopted such strong
</p>
<p>measures without having very strong proof of the exist
</p>
<p>ence of such conspiracies and of the importance of sup
</p>
<p>pressing them/ 1
</p>
<p>The world also thought that the President possessed
</p>
<p>&quot;strong proofs&quot; and believed him accordingly.
</p>
<p>&quot;Some weeks ago it was our opinion,&quot; read a most
</p>
<p>significant editorial in the Lexington Gazette for Decem
</p>
<p>ber i Qth, &quot;that Burr s designs were not unfavorable to
</p>
<p>the interests of the Union. This opinion was predicated
</p>
<p>upon the information of persons whom we believed to be
</p>
<p>in his confidence, and from a belief that he hnd too much
</p>
<p>sense to think of withdrawing the attachment of the citi
</p>
<p>zens of the Western country from the government of
</p>
<p>their choice. Our opinion was that he meditated an at
</p>
<p>tack on Mexico by the authority of the government
</p>
<p>9 should a war take place with Spain of which there ap
</p>
<p>peared a strong probability. To this opinion we thought
</p>
<p>it improper to give publicity through the public prints,
</p>
<p>in as much as it might convey notice to the Spaniards of
</p>
<p>the meditated attack, and enable them to prepare to repel
</p>
<p>it ; but we never hesitated to do so in conversation. How
</p>
<p>ever, we now declare that opinion changed by the Presi
</p>
<p>dent s Proclamation and Communication to Congress and
</p>
<p>by the statement of General Eaton.&quot;
</p>
<p>This paragraph written large well expresses the
</p>
<p>revulsion which took place in the Western mind. It is
</p>
<p>equally interesting for the light it casts upon the nature
</p>
<p>of the project. Burr had not been gone ten days from

<p>month and a half after he had had notice from Burr that

<p>menaced.&quot; 1 He was advised to hurry the preparations
</p>
<p>of his vessels and to consult with Wilkinson as to their
</p>
<p>disposition. Three days later the Governor informed
</p>
<p>Dearborn that the General was picketing in the city
</p>
<p>and repairing the forts, and that they were anxiously
</p>
<p>awaiting the troops from the frontier ; they would then
</p>
<p>have a force of eight hundred, exclusive of the Orleans
</p>
<p>volunteers. 2 Twenty-four hours later he sent a second
</p>
<p>letter to Washington :
</p>
<p>&quot;If General- Wilkinson is not greatly mistaken,&quot; he
</p>
<p>confided to Madison, 3 &quot;the safety of this Territory is
</p>
<p>seriously menaced. You may, however, be assured that
</p>
<p>every exertion will be made to repel the advancing foe.
</p>
<p>General Wilkinson tells me that he has heretofore re
</p>
<p>ceived hints of a Mexican expedition, and from the char
</p>
<p>acters who it seems are the leaders of the present plot;
</p>
<p>but had attached no consequence to their conversation,
</p>
<p>under an impression, that unless sanctioned by the gov
</p>
<p>ernment, no men of reputation and talents could seriously
</p>
<p>contemplate an object of the kind. General Wilkinson
</p>
<p>will doubtless become extremely obnoxious to the asso
</p>
<p>ciates ; but his fidelity to his country will be justly appre
</p>
<p>ciated by the good and virtuous.&quot;
</p>
<p>Claiborne also assured the Secretary of State that
</p>
<p>the greater part of the inhabitants of the city could be
</p>
<p>depended upon to render assistance, while many of
</p>
<p>those to the west of the Mississippi would die for their
</p>
<p>country.
</p>
<p>December 5th, the Governor received further proof
</p>
<p>of the danger to which the country was exposed. It

<p>was a communication from Andrew Jackson :

</p>
<p>WILKINSON IN NEW ORLEANS 203
</p>
<p>&quot;Put your town in a state of defense,&quot; said he to
</p>
<p>Claiborne. &quot;Organize your militia, and defend your city
</p>
<p>as well against internal enemies as external. My knowl
</p>
<p>edge does not extend so far as to authorize me to go
</p>
<p>into details, but I fear you will meet with an attack from
</p>
<p>quarters you do not at present expect. Be upon the
</p>
<p>alert keep a watchful eye on our General and beware
</p>
<p>of an attack as well from your own country as from
</p>
<p>Spain. ... I fear there are plans on foot inimical to
</p>
<p>the Union whether they will be attempted to be carried
</p>
<p>into effect or not, 1 cannot say but rest assured they are
</p>
<p>in operation, or I calculate badly beware of the month
</p>
<p>of December. I love my country and government I hate
</p>
<p>the Dons I would delight to see Mexico reduced; but
</p>
<p>I will die in the last ditch before I would yield a foot
</p>
<p>to the Dons or see the Union disunited.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>Claiborne afterwards said that this letter had re-
</p>
<p>enforced in his mind Wilkinson s stories which was
</p>
<p>no doubt true. But it did not raise the slightest ques
</p>
<p>tion as to the honesty of the General, who still advised
</p>
<p>under pain of disaster the closeting of the secret. That
</p>
<p>Claiborne could not keep ; he exposed the whole of it to
</p>
<p>Mayor Watkins, who advised the immediate dispatch
</p>
<p>ing of a courier to the various Governors of the West
</p>
<p>ern States. 2 Evidently Claiborne thought of acting on
</p>

<p>that you will make the necessary exertions to ascertain
</p>
<p>the extent of his lawless combination and to defeat their
</p>
<p>wicked machinations.&quot;
</p>
<p>It is probable that this circular letter never left the
</p>
<p>office of the Governor ; at least no trace of it elsewhere
</p>
<p>has been found. The ensuing day, however, he sent
</p>
<p>J. W. Gurley to Cowles Meade, the Secretary and Act
</p>
<p>ing-Governor of the Mississippi Territory, with a verbal
</p>
<p>story of the apprehended trouble. 1 Meade replied
</p>
<p>calmly that his mind had been prepared for such in
</p>
<p>telligence, but that the people were patriotic and that
</p>
<p>therefore there was nothing to fear. 2 Indeed almost
</p>
<p>a month earlier he had written Claiborne concerning
</p>
<p>the conspiracy, denouncing Wilkinson in the strongest
</p>
<p>terms : 8
</p>
<p>&quot;It is believed here,&quot; said Meade, &quot;that General Wil
</p>
<p>kinson is the soul of the conspiracy, and a requisition late
</p>
<p>made of me for five hundred militia has confirmed the
</p>
<p>suspicion in the minds of many. This militia was re
</p>
<p>quired to defend, or protect New Orleans, and support
</p>
<p>the laws and government of the United States. Is New
</p>
<p>Orleans invaded? Is it threatened? Or is it believed
</p>
<p>that any enemy is nearer than the general himself ? Gen
</p>
<p>eral Wilkinson is concentrating the whole military force
</p>
<p>of the United States at New Orleans. He has ordered
</p>
<p>down the troops from Natchitoches, from Fort Stephens,
</p>
<p>and Fort Adams this last fort is entirely dismantled
</p>
<p>all the ordnance taken away for New Orleans or else
</p>
<p>where. What is all this for? Is it to act for you or
</p>
<p>against you ?&quot;
</p>
<p>Thus before Burr was accused the second time in

</p>
<p>Kentucky, before the Proclamation had been inspired,
</p>
<p>before the General had made his way into the Crescent
</p>
<p>City the people of Mississippi felt that some mysteri
</p>
<p>ous danger was impending, but suspected Wilkinson
</p>
<p>with whom Burr was always associated of being at
</p>
<p>the bottom of it. It is perfectly clear that Meade had
</p>
<p>no confidence in the General, while he expressed his
</p>
<p>utmost faith in the virtue and loyalty of the citizens.
</p>
<p>Because of his distrust in the one case and confidence
</p>
<p>in the other, he was accused of being in sympathy with
</p>
<p>the conspirators by Wilkinson and Governor Williams
</p>
<p>of Mississippi and dismissed from office. Nevertheless,
</p>
<p>he was beyond question the most efficient official in the
</p>
<p>West and therefore could expect no better reward.
</p>
<p>By the sixth of December Wilkinson thought the
</p>
<p>city ready for a step forward. As yet, indeed, the
</p>
<p>inhabitants knew nothing of what was in his mind and
</p>
<p>could only feel that his urgent preparations betokened
</p>
<p>an impending calamity. The city quaked with perturba
</p>
<p>tions and alarms. On the day in point Wilkinson sent
</p>
<p>the Governor the following utterly unconscionable let
</p>
<p>ter, calculated to unnerve him completely: 1
</p>
<p>&quot;The dangers which impend over this city,&quot; said the
</p>
<p>General, &quot;and menace the laws and government of the

<p>the fair fabric of our independence purchased by the best
</p>
<p>blood of our country will be prostrated, and the Goddess

<p>strong arm of military law. Having exposed to you
</p>
<p>without reserve the authentic grounds on which I found
</p>
<p>my apprehensions, you can readily comprehend the high,
</p>
<p>solemn and important considerations by which I am
</p>
<p>moved, when I most earnestly entreat you to proclaim

<p>martial law over the city, its ports and precincts. For,
</p>
<p>unless I am authorized to repress the seditious and arrest
</p>
<p>the disaffected, and to call the resources of the place into
</p>
<p>active operation, the defects of my force may expose me
</p>
<p>to be overwhelmed by numbers, and the cause and place
</p>
<p>will be lost/

<p>He also combated Claiborne s suggestion that the

<p>Territory. &quot;You could not for a moment withstand
</p>
<p>the desperation and superiority of numbers opposed to

<p>you and the brigands, provoked by the opposition,

<p>might resort to the dreadful expedient of exciting a

<p>subject in the present eventful moment, I must entreat

<p>you to act with decision ; I believe I have been betrayed,

<p>and therefore shall abandon the idea of temporizing or

<p>WILKINSON IN NEW ORLEANS 207
</p>
<p>It appears that he deliberately tried to frighten Clai-
</p>
<p>borne into proclaiming martial law : lack of carpenters,
</p>
<p>the presence of enemies, his own betrayal, and the near
</p>
<p>ness of Burr s &quot;rebellious bands.&quot; But the Governor
</p>
<p>discovered that carpenters could be had, and, in the
</p>
<p>event of immediate danger, the militia of Orleans could
</p>
<p>be called out ; while the matter of the General s betrayal
</p>
<p>seems not to have elicited response even from Clai-
</p>
<p>borne. 1 It is apparent that he was not fully in sym
</p>
<p>pathy with the commander-in-chief of the army, for he
</p>
<p>did not feel martial law to be the only salvation.
</p>
<p>&quot;Preparatory to the declaration of martial law/ he
</p>
<p>wrote Meade on the eighth, 2 &quot;the suspension of the writ
</p>
<p>of habeas corpus would be necessary; but this high pre
</p>
<p>rogative can, in my opinion, be alone exercised by the
</p>
<p>territorial legislature, and was that body in session I
</p>
<p>should, under existing circumstances, advise the measure.
</p>
<p>As to martial law, I shall not proclaim it; but as the
</p>
<p>danger increases, such measures will from time to time be
</p>
<p>resorted to, as the general safety may require.&quot;
</p>
<p>The following day the Governor addressed a note
</p>
<p>in French to the commanders of the militia of the city
</p>
<p>saying that various reasons had led him to believe that
</p>
<p>a large and dangerous body of men were to descend the
</p>
<p>Mississippi and imperil the city. He therefore re
</p>
<p>quested that the militia be made ready to march; that
</p>
<p>the slaves be watched, and that guards be mounted. 8
</p>
<p>There were also signs of weakening in his attitude
</p>
<p>toward delivering the city over to the military power.

<p>had agents in the city, but that it was difficult to bring
</p>
<p>them to justice; and in the next breath he took up the
</p>
<p>matter of the habeas corpus i 1
</p>
<p>&quot;I continue to think that the power of suspending the
</p>
<p>privilege of the habeas corpus more properly devolves
</p>
<p>upon the legislature, but if the danger should augment
</p>
<p>and the privilege of the habeas corpus should by impeding
</p>
<p>the arrest of the suspected be found to favor the escape
</p>
<p>of the guilty, it is probable that I shall by proclamation
</p>
<p>direct the suspension thereof, and plead in justification

<p>the necessity of the case.&quot;
</p>
<p>The ninth of December is memorable by reason
</p>
<p>of the seizure of the Muskingum flotilla and the dis
</p>
<p>covery of the secret of the conspiracy to the inhabitants
</p>
<p>of New Orleans. At the request of Wilkinson and the
</p>
<p>Governor the members of the Chamber of Commerce
</p>
<p>met at the Government House. The assembly was
</p>
<p>called to order by Paul Lanusse, Richard Relf acting
</p>
<p>as secretary. Claiborne at once arose and stated that
</p>
<p>they had been convened in order that steps might be
</p>
<p>devised to defeat Burr who was about to attack the city.
</p>
<p>He thought that money ought to be donated for the
</p>
<p>purpose of equipping soldiers and sailors to man the
</p>
<p>guns on land and water. He hoped, he said, that Cap
</p>
<p>tain Shaw would be at once reenforced. When the
</p>
<p>Governor had finished the General took up the theme,
</p>
<p>telling of the plot and how he had discovered it; re
</p>
<p>marking that his knowledge of the premeditated expe

<p>dition had been first communicated to him by a special

<p>messenger of the conspirators on the eighth of October,

<p>Sabine. The object of making him acquainted with
</p>
<p>the plot was the hope of his cooperation with them;
</p>
<p>but without letting the messenger know his determina
</p>
<p>tion he had set out for the Sabine where he settled
</p>
<p>the boundary controversy, and with all the expedition
</p>
<p>in his power had repaired to New Orleans where he
</p>
<p>intended to concentrate his forces in order to defend
</p>
<p>it or perish in its ruins. He added that while he was
</p>
<p>at Natchitoches he had received a message from New
</p>
<p>Orleans on the same subject, and that there were sev
</p>
<p>eral persons in the city whom he knew to be concerned
</p>
<p>in the plot. These he would have arrested long since
</p>
<p>had he had the power. His object in coming to the city
</p>
<p>was to prepare it for defense; but the subsequent
</p>
<p>advices from the invaders led him to believe that their
</p>
<p>forces would be greater than he at first expected, there
</p>
<p>fore he had changed his plans and intended if possible
</p>
<p>to attack them before they reached New Orleans. He
</p>
<p>flattered himself that if they could succeed in manning
</p>
<p>the flotilla and could encounter the foe above Natchez
</p>
<p>they might be forced to land and thus be annihilated.
</p>
<p>To effect this object it was necessary that there should
</p>
<p>be no delay, for by all advices the enemy, at least
</p>
<p>2,000 strong, were to arrive at Natchez on the twentieth
</p>
<p>instant. He observed that the leaders of the plot were
</p>
<p>supported by some of the first characters of the Union ;
</p>
<p>that their primary object was to reduce New Orleans
</p>
<p>so that arms, provisions, and boats might be procured
</p>
<p>for an attack on Mexico, which was to proceed both by
</p>
<p>land and sea. In case good fortune attended the enter

<p>prise the Western States were then to be separated from

</p>
<p>the Union. To give efficiency to the execution of the
</p>
<p>plot, armed but disguised vessels were to come into the
</p>
<p>river to serve as convoy for the expedition which was
</p>
<p>to sail from thence to Vera Cruz. He concluded with
</p>
<p>pledging his life in the defense of the city and his coun
</p>
<p>try. The Governor and General thereupon withdrew
</p>
<p>and the merchants discussed the matters which had
</p>
<p>been laid before them. If the expedition could be de
</p>
<p>feated by manning the war vessels, that should be done.
</p>
<p>They immediately voted an embargo and agreed to re
</p>
<p>lease any sailor of their merchantmen who desired to
</p>
<p>enter the navy. 1 Acting under this agreement, Clai-
</p>
<p>borne at once instructed Captain Shaw to permit no
</p>
<p>vessel to leave port without orders from Wilkinson or
</p>
<p>himself. 2
</p>
<p>Now, indeed, so far as the public was concerned,
</p>
<p>the screen had been thrown aside. The mystery which
</p>
<p>had surrounded the actions of the General had been
</p>
<p>swept away in a gust of confidence. The reason for
</p>
<p>the hasty construction of defenses was made plain ; but
</p>
<p>the excitement lessened, for it is a truism that so long
</p>
<p>as a thing is half concealed it creates the greater inter
</p>
<p>est. One naturally asks why Wilkinson spent two
</p>
<p>weeks in New Orleans before making public his impor
</p>
<p>tant information; or more properly, why he had kept
</p>
<p>the secret for two months from the people whose prop
</p>
<p>erties were to be sacrificed. He pretended to fear that

<p>Jamaica to look after the English dispositions, receiv
</p>
<p>ing a scornful note from the admiral in reply. Notwith
</p>
<p>standing, the only guard stationed at the mouth of the
</p>
<p>river was the custom-house. Wilkinson s own reasons
</p>
<p>for his silence were the following :
</p>
<p>&quot;I represented to him [James Brown] that I had con
</p>
<p>cealed my intentions from the double view of preserving
</p>
<p>my person from assassination, and to keep open the chan
</p>
<p>nels of communication by which I received information
</p>
<p>of their secret designs and movements, and that the con
</p>
<p>duct of the emissaries, I added, had been hitherto so cir
</p>
<p>cumspect, as to put it out of my power to convict them of
</p>
<p>any overt act to justify their commitment without bail.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>His silence then had not been inspired by an ardent
</p>
<p>desire to save the city, which, according to his frequent
</p>
<p>letters, was menaced from within and from without,
</p>
<p>but to save himself from assassination and to make a
</p>
<p>case against those unfortunates who had once plotted
</p>
<p>with him the conquest of Mexico ! If there is anything
</p>
<p>that is disgusting it is Wilkinson s sheepisrT fear of
</p>
<p>death. He spoke of it elsewhere in one of his famous
</p>
<p>letters to Jefferson. But fear of assassination, which
</p>
<p>he knew he probably deserved from having turned
</p>
<p>traitor to his friends, did not interfere with the game
</p>
<p>he was playing for all its worth. The day after he
</p>
<p>had paraded before the merchants he wrote Daniel

</p>
<p>&quot;I refer you to the bearer, Mr. Donaldson, for the in
</p>
<p>teresting scenes which agitate our darling city and poor
</p>
<p>devoted Louisiana. I am here to defend her against
</p>
<p>revolution and pillage by a hand I have loved. Suspicion
</p>
<p>is afloat, and numbers are implicated. ... By the

<p>last advice Burr expected to reach Natchez with 2,000
</p>
<p>men the 2oth instant. If he brings&quot; no more, he will not
</p>
<p>dare to approach this place, where I shall to-morrow have
</p>
<p>1,000 regular troops; and your Creoles will turn out with
</p>
<p>great vivacity. I am pushing an armed flotilla high up
</p>
<p>the river, to drive the revolutionists on shore, and save
</p>
<p>your plantations and prevent the insurrection of your
</p>
<p>negroes.&quot;
</p>
<p>Strange that in the midst of such perilous times
</p>
<p>Wilkinson could write reassuring letters as to his
</p>
<p>strength and the loyalty of the Creoles. There was,
</p>
<p>however, ground for his optimism. Besides, he knew
</p>
<p>the impossibility of such a body of men being trans
</p>
<p>ported in a single expedition down the Mississippi, for
</p>
<p>he had spent weeks arranging for the removal of a
</p>
<p>twentieth part of that number from St. Louis to
</p>
<p>Fort Adams. Yet he pretended that a private individ
</p>
<p>ual in a three-month space could muster and embark
</p>
<p>an army of from two to eight thousand men in a civi
</p>
<p>lized community for the purpose of sacking a city of
</p>
<p>their own country! Also his expression of confidence
</p>
<p>that Burr would not dare to approach New Orleans
</p>
<p>was never whispered to the &quot;darling city and poor de
</p>
<p>voted Louisiana.&quot; On the contrary he poured constant
</p>
<p>alarms into the too willing ears of the Governor, and

<p>deliberately terrified the inhabitants.

</p>
<p>making a change of position with at least five hundred
</p>
<p>of the troops.&quot; 1 He was answered immediately. The
</p>
<p>General was asked to devise some scheme whereby the
</p>
<p>sailors might be procured, and whether he thought
</p>
<p>impressment ought to be resorted to. Claiborne con
</p>
<p>tinued :
</p>
<p>&quot;I am sincerely desirous to cooperate with you in all your
</p>
<p>measures. Many good disposed citizens do not appear
</p>
<p>to think the danger considerable, and there are others who
</p>
<p>(perhaps from wicked intentions) endeavor to turn our
</p>
<p>preparations into ridicule ; but these things have no effect
</p>
<p>on my mind.&quot; 2
</p>
<p>The General s air of blustering seriousness together
</p>
<p>with his preparations became in due time the laughing
</p>
<p>stock of the populace; and he realized that the influence
</p>
<p>of the conservative element was working in Claiborne,
</p>
<p>but he had not yet despaired of winning him over. In
</p>
<p>a note of the fifteenth he upbraided the Governor for
</p>
<p>his colorless action : 3
</p>
<p>&quot;Having put my life and character in opposition to the
</p>
<p>flagitious enterprise of one of the ablest men of our coun

<p>try, supported by a crowd of co-equals, ceremony would

<p>speak from my heart when I declare hat I verily believe
</p>
<p>you are sincerely desirous to cooperate with me in all my

<p>measures; but pardon the honest candor which circum

<p>stances require and my situation demands, when I observe

<p>harass you with their criticisms on subjects which they do
</p>
<p>not understand, and their opposition to measures which
</p>
<p>they do not comprehend, or which, understanding, they are
</p>
<p>desirous to prevent or to defeat. What will our alertness
</p>
<p>import, without force and energy to support it ? And can
</p>
<p>we be prepared without means ? Shall our reverence for
</p>
<p>our civil institutions produce their annihilation, or shall
</p>
<p>we lose the house because we will not break the windows ?&quot;
</p>
<p>The merchants were among the first to ignore Wil
</p>
<p>kinson s alarms. However willing they appeared at
</p>
<p>first to part with their seamen, they spou relented and
</p>
<p>took measures to retain them. This act of confidence
</p>
<p>exasperated Wilkinson, who retaliated by demanding
</p>
<p>of Claiborne the impressment of the sailors for six
</p>
<p>months. The latter urged that two months was time
</p>
<p>enough; later offering to compromise by making the
</p>
<p>term of enlistment expire with the destruction of the
</p>
<p>lawless banditti from the Ohio. But the General replied
</p>
<p>that in his &quot;cool and deliberate judgment&quot; and from
</p>
<p>&quot;his knowledge of Burr s character and desperation&quot;
</p>
<p>and from &quot;the apparent toleration and support which
</p>
<p>he receives in Kentucky and Tennessee,&quot; we have
</p>
<p>reached an extremity in public affairs, which impe
</p>
<p>riously demands &quot;the momentary dispensation of the
</p>
<p>ordinary course of our civil institutions to preserve the
</p>
<p>sanctuary of public liberty.&quot; The seamen should be
</p>
<p>&quot;compelled to serve the country which gave them birth
</p>
<p>and gives them protection.&quot; 1 Wilkinson s purpose
</p>
<p>needs no elucidation. But after the first wave of ex
</p>
<p>citement had spent itself, society at New Orleans as

<p>sumed a stolidity upon which the General s alarms beat

<p>in vain. Only now and again was there a ripple of
</p>
<p>excitement, caused by some startling report or sudden
</p>
<p>usurpation.
</p>
<p>December 14, 1806 Burr and Adair were riding
</p>
<p>into Nashville Wilkinson began that series of rnilitary
</p>
<p>arrests which served as precedents for the worst of
</p>
<p>Reconstruction times, and which, when causes are con
</p>
<p>sidered, are still unparalleled. On his own authority, l*^&amp;gt;t A
</p>
<p>and in violent conflict with the civil government, he
</p>
<p>arrested and detained whomsoever he pleased. He still
</p>
<p>urged, however, with all the vehemence which at
</p>
<p>times approached insolence he could command that
</p>
<p>Claiborne should order the impressment of seamen,
</p>
<p>should suspend the writ of habeas corpus, and declare
</p>
<p>martial law. But Claiborne resolutely refused to act
</p>
<p>in the premises, or to implicate himself in the cases
</p>
<p>arising from the military seizures, leaving their respon
</p>
<p>sibility wholly to their author. 1 &quot;The judiciary of the
</p>
<p>territory,&quot; said Claiborne, plainly condemning the
</p>
<p>usurpation of the functions of the court, &quot;having ex
</p>
<p>clusive cognizance of offenses, is the only tribunal to
</p>
<p>which I can refer you, nor can any acts of mine arrest
</p>
<p>or suspend their powers.&quot;
</p>
<p>Failing to protect himself with the mantle of the
</p>
<p>Governor s proclamation, Wilkinson nevertheless held
</p>
<p>straight on his course. Erick Bollman who had come,
</p>
<p>to New Orleans by sea from New York, and with
</p>
<p>whom the General had had some interviews Ogden,
</p>
<p>and Swartwout were the first to fall under his ban, the/

</p>
<p>Swartwout and Bollman were confined aboard ship and
</p>
<p>within four and twenty hours were flying under full
</p>
<p>sail toward Washington, in the custody of Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Wilson, who had orders to permit the prisoners no
</p>
<p>communications save with commissioned officers. The
</p>
<p>suspects were consigned to the President, and were to
</p>
<p>be held in safekeeping till his wish was known. 1
</p>
<p>These arrests precipitated an embittered but one
</p>
<p>sided contest with the courts. On the afternoon of the
</p>
<p>fifteenth Alexander d Avergne sued out a writ of
</p>
<p>habeas corpus before Judge Sprigg of the Superior
</p>
<p>Court in behalf of Bollman. But the judge would not
</p>
<p>act alone Mathews, his associate, was absent so the
</p>
<p>matter went over to the following day, when a writ was
</p>
<p>obtained. Writs were likewise granted by James
</p>
<p>Workman, judge of the County of Orleans, in favor of
</p>
<p>Ogden and Swartwout. Return was made the next
</p>
<p>day at five o clock by Captain Shaw, who, after a con
</p>
<p>sultation with Claiborne, gave over Ogden the other
</p>
<p>two were not in his keeping. Ogden was brought be
</p>
<p>fore Judge Workman, but no evidence being offered
</p>
<p>against him he was discharged.
</p>
<p>Amid the excitement attending these first seizures,

<p>Claiborne issued, December i6th, a proclamation 2
</p>
<p>against an unlawful combination associated for the
</p>
<p>purpose of overthrowing the Government of the United
</p>

<p>therein warned the citizens of the Territory of Orleans
</p>
<p>to abstain from any connection whatever with the asso
</p>
<p>ciates, pointing out the consequences by quoting the
</p>
<p>Federal statutes which provide severe penalties for
</p>
<p>such infractions of the law.
</p>
<p>Wednesday, the seventeenth of December, Wilkin
</p>
<p>son s aide, appearing before the Superior Court to
</p>
<p>answer the writ for Bollman, read the following order
</p>
<p>over the General s signature :
</p>
<p>&quot;The commander of the army of the United States
</p>
<p>takes on himself all the responsibility which may result
</p>
<p>from the arrest of Erick Bollman, who is accused of being
</p>
<p>guilty of the crime of treason against the government
</p>
<p>and the laws of the United States, and I have taken op
</p>
<p>portune measures to warrant his safe delivery into the
</p>
<p>hands of the President. General Wilkinson adopted this
</p>
<p>precaution only after many conferences with the governor
</p>
<p>and two judges of this territory, desiring alone to secure
</p>
<p>the nation which is menaced to its foundation by a band of
</p>
<p>traitors associated with Aaron Burr whose accomplices
</p>
<p>stretch from New York to this city. . . . Nobody
</p>
<p>holds in higher regard than I, the civil institutions of his
</p>
<p>country, and only to maintain and perpetuate the sacred
</p>
<p>attributes of the Constitution against the hands of daring
</p>
<p>violence have I arrested Bollman, as I shall arrest, with
</p>
<p>out respect to class or station, all those against whom I
</p>
<p>have positive proof of being accomplices in the machina
</p>
<p>tions against the state.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>In support of these statements the General sent to
</p>
<p>the court a paper which he declared to be a copy of
</p>
<p>Burr s cipher letter; 2 also some notes of Dr. Bollman,
</p>
<p>adding that other important discoveries had been made,

<p>but that the time was inopportune for their disclosure.
</p>
<p>Now, too, he chose to send the President a copy of
</p>
<p>Burr s cipher letter, which Jefferson had frequently re
</p>
<p>quested. In the same communication he took up the
</p>
<p>matter of his arrests, the news of which he had already
</p>
<p>reported :*
</p>
<p>&quot;Sir, since my last of the 14 inst, writs of habeas
</p>
<p>corpus have been issued for the bodies of Bollman, Swart-
</p>
<p>wout and Ogden, the two latter by Judge Workman who
</p>
<p>is strongly suspected for being connected with Burr in his
</p>
<p>conspiracy, as I have proof this man declared some time
</p>
<p>since that the republican who possesses power and does
</p>
<p>not employ it to establish a despotism is a fool. His writ
</p>
<p>for Ogden was served on Captain Shaw of the navy who
</p>
<p>had been in charge at my request on board the Etna bomb
</p>
<p>ketch. He delivered him up, and Mr. Workman has dis
</p>
<p>charged him without giving me a word of information,
</p>
<p>although he knew he was confined by my order for a
</p>
<p>treasonable combination with Burr, and Mr. Ogden now
</p>
<p>struts at large. Swartwout, I have sent off and shall so
</p>
<p>report, holding myself ready for the consequences. Boll
</p>
<p>man was required by the Superior Court, but I have got
</p>
<p>rid of that affair also, under the usual liability for dam
</p>
<p>ages, in which case I shall look to our country for pro
</p>
<p>tection.&quot;
</p>
<p>While Wilkinson was thus engaged in hedging,
</p>
<p>Shaw and Claiborne appeared at headquarters to argue
</p>
<p>against his summary military arrests. But he answered
</p>
<p>them that he would do as he thought best. 2 It fol
</p>
<p>lowed that Ogden was not long to strut at large/
</p>
<p>Within twenty-four hours he was again arrested along
</p>
<p>with Mr. Alexander, and the two were escorted over

<p>crees. Livingston, therefore, on the twenty-sixth
</p>
<p>moved for an attachment against him. The General
</p>
<p>simply unmasked his batteries:
</p>
<p>&quot;The undersigned, commanding the armies of the
</p>
<p>United States, has taken upon himself the responsibility
</p>
<p>of arresting Peter V. Ogden, on a charge of misprision of
</p>
<p>treason against the government and laws of the United
</p>
<p>States, and has the honor to inform the Honorable James
</p>
<p>Workman, judge of the county of Orleans, that the body
</p>
<p>of the said Peter V. Ogden is not in his power, possession
</p>
<p>or custody.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>Judge Workman upon the receipt of this ultimatum,
</p>
<p>for the third time appealed to Claiborne to know
</p>
<p>whether he meant to support the civil government
</p>
<p>against the military. He explained the difficulties, set
</p>
<p>ting forth that Wilkinson commanded the army of the
</p>
<p>United States and also a large part of the militia of
</p>
<p>the Territory, a state of things rendering it exceedingly
</p>
<p>delicate as well as dangerous to attempt the enforce
</p>
<p>ment of the attachment by the usual method, the posse
</p>
<p>comitatus. But never a word sent Claiborne in reply.
</p>
<p>He contented himself with appealing to Wilkinson to
</p>
<p>yield to the civil authorities. 2 However, the advice
</p>
<p>was no more heeded than Workman s writs. Jan
</p>
<p>uary 5, 1807, the judge of the County of Orleans sent
</p>
<p>his last unavailing protest to the Governor ; then, wait
</p>
<p>ing a week for a reply, he took the only step left open
</p>
<p>to him:

<p>your excellency not only declines the performance of your
</p>
<p>duties as chief magistrate of this territory, but actually
</p>
<p>supports the lawless measures of its oppressor, I have
</p>
<p>adjourned the court of the County of Orleans sine die.&quot;
</p>
<p>Claiborne never flinched under this stirring reproof
</p>
<p>of his passivity; by his failure to resist the en
</p>
<p>croachments of the military power, to support the
</p>
<p>established machinery of government, he gave his
</p>
<p>assent to the extraordinary regime the General had seen
</p>
<p>fit to inaugurate. The city was in fact delivered over
</p>
<p>to Wilkinson. Judge Workman no longer protested,
</p>
<p>but grimly resigned. 1 In his own justification he wrote
</p>
<p>to the Legislature of the Territory : 2
</p>
<p>&quot;The public journals have announced my resignation
</p>
<p>as judge of your county. I offer the following letters and
</p>
<p>documents to your notice, anxious to prove that I did not

<p>cause than the failure of my efforts to obtain from the

<p>executive the support necessary to the performance of my

<p>duties. Every possible exertion was made by me, but in
</p>
<p>vain, to repress the usurped power that subverted and

<p>insulted the law.&quot;
</p>
<p>Wilkinson early decided to denounce Workman,
</p>
<p>and did so to Jefferson; to Claiborne he averred, &quot;It

<p>pains me to add, but it is my duty to declare, that I

</p>
<p>man and Kerr have been discovered in an intrigue to
</p>
<p>corrupt the army and to plunder the bank.&quot; 1 The truth
</p>
<p>was that Wilkinson had learned months before from
</p>
<p>Burr that Workman was enthusiastic in their cause ; it
</p>
<p>was politic, therefore, to compromise him, and, giving
</p>
<p>out these rumors as his excuse, he sent a patrol to seize
</p>
<p>the judge, likewise Kerr ; and both were held for trial at
</p>
<p>Natchez. Editor Bradford, too, of the Orleans Gazette,
</p>
<p>was arrested; but on second thought the General had
</p>
<p>him released. Nevertheless, the fact of the interference
</p>
<p>had a stifling effect. As the Augusta Herald face
</p>
<p>tiously expressed it, A military government had so en
</p>
<p>tirely superceded the civil authorities, a printer dared
</p>
<p>not publish a political paper because of the expense
</p>
<p>attached to a northegi voyage. 2
</p>
<p>At high noon, January I4th, while Burr and his asso
</p>
<p>ciates were meeting difficulties at Bayou Pierre, John
</p>
<p>Adair of Kentucky rode into New Orleans and estab
</p>
<p>lished himself at Madame Nourage s boarding house.
</p>
<p>A contemporary has left us this account of the next
</p>
<p>act : 3
</p>
<p>&quot;January 14, General Adair arrived in New Orleans.
</p>
<p>This gentleman, it was reported, was to hold a dignified
</p>
<p>position in Burr s army. He made his entry into the city
</p>
<p>about one o clock and alone. He took up his lodging at
</p>
<p>a public boarding house, and being indispose d sent a mes
</p>
<p>sage to the governor to inform him of his arrival and
</p>
<p>requested that information might be sent General Wilkin
</p>
<p>son to the same effect. He mentioned that he left Nash
</p>
<p>ville December 22, and that Burr was then there with
</p>
<p>Clark s Proofs, note 71.

<p>^Orleans Gazette, April 3, 1807.
</p>
<p>WILKINSON IN NEW ORLEANS 223
</p>
<p>only two flatboats destined for this city. He had been in
</p>
<p>New Orleans but once, in 1800, when he remained but a
</p>
<p>few days and could not have had any extensive acquaint
</p>
<p>ance. He had very recently occupied a very high govern
</p>
<p>mental place and was esteemed greatly for his talents and
</p>
<p>bravery. About four o clock on the same day of his
</p>
<p>arrival, while at dinner, a detachment of regular troops,
</p>
<p>150 strong, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Kings-
</p>
<p>bury, posted themselves before the door of the hotel.
</p>
<p>Adair was violently dragged from the table, paraded
</p>
<p>through the streets to the gaze of the people, and though
</p>
<p>sick, was committed to close confinement in cold barracks,
</p>
<p>and denied the writ of habeas corpus/
</p>
<p>Adair, too, was hurried away by sea on the charge
</p>
<p>of being an accomplice of Burr. As late as February
</p>
<p>25th, Lieutenant Spence, who had carried messages to
</p>
<p>Burr in Kentucky, was made a prisoner; but with the
</p>
<p>arrest of Adair came the climax of Wilkinson s high
</p>
<p>handed measures. He had made a number of seizures,
</p>
<p>but in the end not one was justified. Their conviction,
</p>
<p>however, was a matter of secondary importance com
</p>
<p>pared with the attitude Jefferson might assume toward
</p>
<p>him; and that that attitude might be favorable, no
</p>
<p>effort was relaxed to prove that sincerity and un
</p>
<p>selfishness, patriotism and honor were the impelling
</p>
<p>springs of his conduct. As a given set of circumstances,
</p>
<p>properly correlated, produce an event, so Jefferson s
</p>
<p>alliance with the chief of the army was inevitable. It
</p>
<p>was publicly announced in the Proclamation. Hence
</p>
<p>forth accusations against Wilkinson were reflections on
</p>

<p>the Executive not only expressed his approbation of

</p>
<p>&quot;Your belief,&quot; he said, &quot;that Burr would really de

<p>scend with six or seven thousand men was no doubt
</p>
<p>founded on what you knew of the numbers which could

<p>be raised in the Western country for an expedition to
</p>
<p>Mexico, under the authority of the Government; but you
</p>
<p>probably did not calculate that the want of that authority
</p>
<p>; would take from him every honest man, and leave him
</p>
<p>only the desperadoes of his party, which in no part of the
</p>
<p>United States can ever be a numerous body. In approv

<p>ing, therefore, as we do approve of the defensive opera
</p>
<p>tions for New Orleans, we are obliged to estimate them,
</p>
<p>not according to our own view of the danger, but to place

<p>ourselves in your situation, and only with your infor

<p>Jefferson spoke, too, approvingly of the arrest of

<p>Swartwout and Bollman and others, but Wilkinson was
</p>
<p>warned to refrain from making prisoners of those
</p>
<p>against whom there was no proof of guilt. The same

<p>day the President wrote Claiborne, grimly predicting
</p>
<p>the struggle which was to extend beyond the precincts
</p>
<p>of the Capital to the trial at Richmond even further
</p>
<p>still a struggle in which strenuous effort was made
</p>
<p>to strangle Thomas Jefferson with the soiled hands of

<p>New Orleans had been so engrossed with the mili

<p>tary seizures that no notice had been taken of the arm
</p>
<p>ing of the war vessels. The work on the fortifications
</p>
<p>became a purely perfunctory employment for idle sol

<p>diers, while in the midst of the impending dangers the
</p>
<p>General remembered to celebrate the day on which
</p>
<p>Louisiana became a part of the territory of the United
</p>
<p>States. The loyalty of the inhabitants no longer
</p>
<p>admitted of a doubt, for by the end of December there
</p>
<p>were nine hundred men completely armed indepen

</p>
<p>Their reason for this action was that the &quot;existing state

<p>being drawn into a war with some foreign power.&quot; 2
</p>
<p>Just then it must have been singularly displeasing to

<p>Wilkinson to hear Louisianians talk of a foreign war,

<p>for, although he had written Clark that the Creoles

</p>
<p>Bonaparte compromises with Great Britain will be the
</p>
<p>signal for a general rising of French and Spaniards, and
</p>
<p>if the Americans do not join, they will not oppose.
</p>
<p>Wilkinson s political prophecies strikingly recall the
</p>
<p>auguries of Merry and Yrujo; and like them were
</p>
<p>equally barren of probability and common sense. To
</p>
<p>hold to-day the loyalty, to-morrow the disloyalty of a
</p>
<p>city which remains unchanged was a feat of judgment-
</p>
<p>gymnastics which Wilkinson accomplished successfully.
</p>
<p>It was all a part of his programme ; and because of his

<p>successes his conceit knew no bounds. He could now
</p>
<p>indulge in a pleasantry with Clark over an attack made

<p>on him by Livingston which only excited laughter &quot;so

<p>much for the establishment,&quot; he repeated, &quot;of an im

</p>
<p>Although Cowles Meade was not possessed of &quot;an

<p>improved character&quot; of the type Wilkinson could boast,
</p>
<p>he proved not less patriotic ; and, while keeping watch

<p>over the Mississippi, continued to warn Claiborne of

<p>the General : 2
</p>
<p>&quot;Should he [Burr] pass us,&quot; wrote Meade the eve

<p>Burr never passed ; and moreover he had a way of
</p>
<p>procrastinating which was likely to exhaust the
</p>
<p>patience of very patient people. The embargo which
</p>
<p>had been rigidly enforced in Louisiana since December

<p>9th, and which had occasioned extensive losses to those

<p>engaged in commerce at the urgent petition of the

<p>vigilance was relaxed, for already the Aetna and two

</p>
<p>were anchored in the vicinity of Natchez. They were

<p>Burr s only means of transportation lay in his flat-

<p>near the city to lend him for a few days one-tenth of

<p>an unauthorized expedition to Mexico, and that, as a pre

<p>to send him away by force that another governor should

<p>would save the country if any hostile projects were enter

<p>may be considered merely as a salutary precaution, not

<p>that he believes Colonel Burr is at Natchez, or that he
</p>
<p>will ever reach this city, under his own volition and he
</p>
<p>warns the citizens not to respect the rumors in circulation,
</p>
<p>because the general by a letter from Colonel Burr s own
</p>
<p>hand, written to Dr. Bollman, is authorized to say that the
</p>
<p>colonel s utmost calculation of force did not exceed 6,000
</p>
<p>and that he would in person precede the main body with
</p>
<p>2,000 men to Natchez, where he intended to halt. The
</p>
<p>faithful citizens may be assured that with moderate exer

<p>tions only, and the expulsion of traitors, the storm will
</p>
<p>burst over the heads of its authors, and hurl them head
</p>
<p>long to perdition, whilst the inhabitants of this city shall

<p>dwell in security. *
</p>
<p>The art of mingling alarm and confidence had been

<p>conceded that this effort was a pitiable failure. The

</p>
<p>Wilkinson was gradually reaching the limit of his
</p>
<p>artifices, and in attempting to keep up the alarm he only
</p>
<p>rendered himself ridiculous. Indeed, at the moment he
</p>
<p>was instigating the council to pass the above capricious
</p>
<p>order, the editor of the Gazette had the audacity to
</p>
<p>say that, concerning the Burr enterprise, it was
</p>
<p>impossible to discover the real circumstances of the case
</p>
<p>in contradiction to those vague and idle rumors, which
</p>
<p>have served only to agitate and mislead the public mind.
</p>
<p>. . . From the best information we can collect the
</p>
<p>object of Colonel Burr is obviously an attack upon Mex

<p>ico, and not, as has been alleged, the parricidal attempt to
</p>
<p>dismember the Union.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>Later the matter was put in a different light and
</p>
<p>pointedly by &quot;Centurio,&quot; in the Gazette. Speaking of
</p>
<p>Wilkinson s tale of Burr s hosts, he said : 2
</p>
<p>&quot;That such an army was approaching was never be
</p>
<p>lieved or affected to be believed but by those who were
</p>
<p>interested in keeping up the alarm ; by the great men, as
</p>
<p>all their greatness depended on it, and by their little ones,
</p>
<p>because they have among them some snug contracts for
</p>
<p>supplying the government with materials of defense.&quot;
</p>
<p>Then, referring to Wilkinson s interference with
</p>
<p>the right of free speech, he added, &quot;To still the blast
</p>
<p>of popular indignation by silencing the press was
</p>
<p>worthy of the then presiding genius the calm of des

</p>
<p>Slowly the days dragged past November I5th and
</p>
<p>December 2Oth and still no &quot;Declaration&quot; had been
</p>
<p>made in the Western States and no army of 2,000 had
</p>
<p>appeared at Natchez. Moreover, not a word was heard
</p>
<p>of hostile armaments from the sea, which the General
</p>
<p>so feared, but to thwart which not an arm had been
</p>
<p>raised, although he had led Jefferson to believe that
</p>
<p>New Orleans had been selected as the point for defense
</p>
<p>because of such apprehension. Never the Declaration
</p>
<p>of Burr, never a company of traitors, and never an
</p>
<p>act of sedition surely those were to be forgiven who
</p>
<p>questioned the reliability of the General s information
</p>
<p>and the sincerity of his conduct.

</p>
<p>days at Bayou Pierre, the commander-in-chief again
</p>
<p>resolved to try conclusions with the enemy in the upper

<p>country.
</p>
<p>&quot;It is my desire to ascend the river,&quot; he said at length
</p>
<p>to Claiborne, 1 &quot;in order to cooperate with our flotilla
</p>
<p>under command of Captain Shaw, to resist and if possible
</p>
<p>to defeat the lawless armament, daily expected at Natchez,
</p>
<p>under the conduct of Aaron Burr ; to carry this plan into
</p>
<p>effect, I find the co-operation of a portion of the militia of
</p>
<p>the territory absolutely indispensable. . . . Mr. Burr s
</p>
<p>approach to us will depend on the extent of his numbers ;
</p>
<p>if he moves in great force his progress will be dilatory,
</p>
<p>and I trust we shall be able to anticipate him above
</p>
<p>Natchez, drive him or\ shore, destroy his boats and pro
</p>
<p>visions, and disperse his adherents. If he advances with
</p>
<p>2,000 men agreeably to his proposition to Dr. Bollman of
</p>
<p>the 3Oth of October, I will seek him wherever he may be

<p>found, and will arrest his course and protect the country.

<p>this city, who in concert with Mr. Burr, aim to subvert the
</p>
<p>Constitution and the laws under which we live, to pillage
</p>
<p>this city, to seize your shipping and to carry an expedition
</p>
<p>against a country in peace with the United States.&quot;
</p>
<p>It was peculiar irony for the General, fresh from his
</p>
<p>defiance of the courts, to talk of the subversion of the
</p>
<p>&quot;laws under which we live.&quot; And hardly less peculiar
</p>
<p>three months having elapsed since Swartwout
</p>
<p>appeared at Natchitoches that he should think it not
</p>
<p>too late to &quot;protect the country.&quot;
</p>
<p>January 12, 1807, the Legislature of the Territory
</p>
<p>of Orleans met in regular session, and Claiborne s mes
</p>
<p>sage, which dealt mainly with the conspiracy, was at
</p>
<p>once submitted. 1 At the instigation of Wilkinson
</p>
<p>there had been embodied in the document an article
</p>
<p>recommending the suspension of the writ of habeas

<p>corpus. Then continued the message: 2
</p>
<p>&quot;That many well-meaning and honest citizens may
</p>
<p>have been seduced (through various means and artifices)
</p>
<p>into a promise to participate in an unauthorized expedi

<p>tion to Mexico, I can readily believe ; these, however, will
</p>
<p>yield obedience to the call of their country, and leave their
</p>
<p>unprincipled leaders to the disgrace which awaits them ;
</p>
<p>but it was really with difficulty I could bring myself to
</p>
<p>think that an association hostile to the government of the
</p>
<p>United States could have been entered into by our citizens.
</p>

<p>behind closed doors the day Wilkinson repeated the

<p>story of the conspiracy he had told over and over. That

<p>legislators had opinions of their own; and they pro
</p>
<p>ceeded to express them by refusing to suspend the writ
</p>
<p>of habeas corpus on the ground that it would be a
</p>
<p>violation of the Federal Constitution. The signal for

<p>the revolt against the tyranny which the city had
</p>
<p>patiently borne for many weeks was penetrating as a
</p>
<p>bugle call. To Claiborne and Wilkinson it was a chal

<p>lenge they dared not accept. If there could have been

<p>doubt in the language of the reply to the Governor s

<p>have vanished with the note sent by the House to Clai

</p>
<p>this House considers it as a sacred duty which they owe

<p>pride in the consciousness that we have not rendered our
</p>
<p>selves unworthy of the blessing and an indignant grief
</p>
<p>which we are sure your honorable body will participate,
</p>
<p>in the reflection that the noblest plan ever devised for the
</p>
<p>protection of personal liberty the finest theory ever
</p>
<p>imagined for the restraint of arbitrary power should,
</p>
<p>before we have well seen its operation, be rendered abor
</p>
<p>tive that the best gift offered by the United States should
</p>
<p>be violently torn from our grasp, and that, while its con
</p>
<p>stitutional guardians looked tamely on, the holy temple of
</p>
<p>justice should be sacrilegiously rifled of this revered palla
</p>
<p>dium of our rights.&quot;
</p>
<p>This was a drastic arraignment of Claiborne and
</p>
<p>Wilkinson ; and stronger words still were to be used :
</p>
<p>&quot;Though nothing can justify, yet circumstances of ex
</p>
<p>treme danger in the moment of invasion, during the sus
</p>
<p>pension of civil authority, might excuse some of these
</p>
<p>violent measures. But here no foreign enemy or open
</p>
<p>domestic foe was then, or has yet been proved to have
</p>
<p>been within any perilous distance of this city, or that
</p>
<p>treason lurked within our walls. . . . The acts of
</p>
<p>high-handed military power to which we have been ex
</p>
<p>posed [are] acts too notorious to be denied, too illegal to
</p>
<p>be justified, too wanton to be excused.&quot;
</p>
<p>During the course of the debate on the Memorial
</p>
<p>the history of the conspiracy was reviewed by various
</p>
<p>speakers. Of these, Dr. Watkins was the most promi
</p>
<p>nent and forceful. He denounced Claiborne for having
</p>
<p>assented to the perversion of the civil law ; for having
</p>
<p>approved the unlawful military arrests; the illegal
</p>
<p>embargo; for having transferred to Wilkinson the

<p>command of the battalion of Orleans Volunteers with

<p>out their consent and knowledge the same militiamen

</p>
<p>eral had terrorized the city, Watkins declared, &quot;If you
</p>
<p>said Burr could not find in Kentucky a sufficient
</p>
<p>number of men, you were accused of wishing to lull the
</p>
<p>people into a dangerous security, to stifle the vigilance
</p>
<p>of government ; and if you gave confidence to the Gen
</p>
<p>eral s information, that Burr could raise six to ten thou
</p>
<p>sand men, you were in both cases a traitor.&quot; *
</p>
<p>It has often been asserted that Burr counted on
</p>
<p>this very Legislature to declare Louisiana independent
</p>
<p>and to tender him the government that he was to wait
</p>
<p>at Natchez to receive a delegation which was to make
</p>
<p>him the offer. 2 Had Burr been so completely deceived ?
</p>
<p>We are likewise assured that every man of wealth and
</p>
<p>influence in New Orleans knew of Burr s project; but
</p>
<p>that they had probably given it little avowed support
</p>
<p>it was too &quot;wild a scheme.&quot; 3 Daniel Clark is cited as
</p>
<p>a type of this character. However, reasoning upon
</p>
<p>broad grounds, the proposition is untenable. How
</p>
<p>could men of wealth and influence hearken to a con
</p>
<p>spiracy which aimed at the looting of their banks, the
</p>
<p>pillaging of their stores, and at the establishment of a
</p>
<p>reign of anarchy? Men are selfish and very rarely
</p>
<p>embark in enterprises where their fortunes as well as
</p>
<p>lives are at stake. The inhabitants of New Orleans
</p>
<p>were no exception to the rule; and if they had ever
</p>
<p>been allied with Burr it was with the understanding
</p>
<p>that the troubled territories of Spain were to receive

<p>freed from the bonds of medievalism. The Creoles
</p>
<p>had indeed lived under such a regime, and for years
</p>
<p>after coming into the Union were looked upon as mal
</p>
<p>contents. History has written that they were ripe for
</p>
<p>revolt, that they were Burr s adherents, and that it
</p>
<p>was only Wilkinson s severe measures that restrained
</p>
<p>them at the crisis. The General declared that to Jef
</p>
<p>ferson; but singularly enough when calm once more
</p>
<p>fell over the Mississippi Valley he confessed to Clark
</p>
<p>that the Creoles had never been connected with Burr.
</p>
<p>&quot;The animosities,&quot; said he, &quot;which have been excited
</p>
<p>in this city by Burr s friends and well-wishers and his
</p>
<p>enemies and opposers are deep, rancorous, and deadly.
</p>
<p>It would seem that the former composed almost exclu
</p>
<p>sively of our own countrymen and foreigners, embrace
</p>
<p>the men of talents and enterprize ; but the latter comprize
</p>
<p>almost the whole of the ancient inhabitants.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>The mass of Louisianians had indeed, prior to the
</p>
<p>enterprise of Burr, accepted in good faith the govern
</p>
<p>ment of the United States. If there had been discon
</p>
<p>tent and intrigue among the Creoles, no one can say
</p>
<p>with authority that at the crisis and afterwards their
</p>
<p>conduct was other than exemplary. When the agita
</p>
<p>tion for the Spanish war was high, Claiborne sent to
</p>
<p>Dearborn a flattering commendation of their loyalty : 2
</p>
<p>&quot;You have already been informed of the patriotism
</p>
<p>manifested by the militia. I have to-day a new proof to
</p>
<p>render of the disposition of the people to rally at the call

<p>of government. A company of volunteer riflemen have

<p>lately been organized in this city, and have tendered their

<p>services to march at such time and to such place as they
</p>
<p>may be ordered.&quot;
</p>
<p>At the moment of Wilkinson s advent into New
</p>
<p>Orleans, when the storm of the conspiracy was already
</p>
<p>high, Claiborne was writing a dispatch which put the
</p>
<p>final seal on his estimate of the Creoles :
</p>
<p>&quot;My opinion as to the native Louisianians,&quot; he re
</p>
<p>lated to Dearborn, &quot;has always been the same; a majority
</p>
<p>are well disposed, and were it not for the calumnies of
</p>
<p>some Frenchmen who are among us, and the intrigue of a
</p>
<p>few ambitious unprincipled men whose native language
</p>
<p>is English, .1 do believe that the Louisianians would be
</p>
<p>very soon among the most zealous and faithful members
</p>
<p>of our Republic.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>That was Wilkinson s belief, too, when he had
</p>
<p>played his game and won. Indeed, it had always been
</p>
<p>his belief; but his winning depended in part on the
</p>
<p>case he could make out against the Creoles. They had
</p>
<p>in fact given some grounds for suspicions and these
</p>
<p>were made the most of ; but that they had been in league A
</p>
<p>with Burr, whatever his plans were, seems improbable \
</p>
<p>enough. With due respect to the opinions of histo
</p>
<p>rians, there is not a credible piece of evidence to show
</p>
<p>the contrary. Wilkinson strove with all his might
</p>
<p>to accumulate data which might be exaggerated into
</p>
<p>serving his purposes. During his dictatorship he took
</p>
<p>every precaution to secure &quot;papers,&quot; accusing every
</p>
<p>man against whom there was the slightest inference of
</p>
<p>complicity in the unspeakable conspiracy. There was *

<p>mails were rifled of every letter which excited the Gen
</p>
<p>eral s suspicions. Nor was this all. He commissioned
</p>
<p>a body of secret police, whose business it was to
</p>
<p>search for evidence. According to J. P. Reibelt, who
</p>
<p>served in that capacity and who had enjoyed a Govern
</p>
<p>ment appointment in Orleans Territory, they were spe
</p>
<p>cially instructed to gather testimony which would
</p>
<p>prove that Burr meant to overthrow the Union and to
</p>
<p>attack Mexico. Reibelt wrote that the Creoles were
</p>
<p>well disposed and that nothing could be found to crimi

<p>nate them. 1
</p>
<p>In fine, what is the secret of Wilkinson s conduct in
</p>
<p>New Orleans? Did he adopt his rigorous course be
</p>
<p>cause he knew the real intentions of the associates?
</p>
<p>When we consider that he knew of the conspiracy as
</p>
<p>early as October 8th ; that he forwarded only an am

<p>biguous notice to the Executive; that he sent no
</p>
<p>advices to the governors of the infected States ; that he

<p>concluded a corrupt treaty with the Spaniards ; that he

<p>was to be sacrificed when we consider all these facts

<p>in connection with his unprecedented conduct in the

<p>capital of Orleans, it must appear that he was playing
</p>
<p>a master role of imposture, and unparalleled in our

<p>history! In sharp contrast to his studied, noisy pro

<p>CHAPTER IX.
</p>
<p>The Expedition.
</p>
<p>*
</p>
<p>MEANTIME, November 12, 1806, the very
</p>
<p>day Wilkinson was sending from Minor s
</p>
<p>Seat his terrifying messages to the officers
</p>
<p>in New Orleans, to the President and to the Viceroy
</p>
<p>of Mexico, John Graham, from Pittsburg, in the dis
</p>
<p>affected region, was calmly writing to Madison :
</p>
<p>&quot;I have taken every proper occasion to make enquiries
</p>
<p>as to the state of the public mind on this side of the moun
</p>
<p>tains, and it gives me pleasure to say that the accounts I
</p>
<p>receive from all descriptions of people, lead to a belief,
</p>
<p>that no serious impressions have been made unfriendly
</p>
<p>to the Union.&quot;
</p>
<p>From Pittsburg Graham dropped down the river to
</p>
<p>Marietta. Shortly after his arrival Blennerhassett
</p>
<p>called on him. Singularly enough, Graham s account
</p>
<p>at the trial of the conversation on that occasion does
</p>
<p>not accord with his correspondence, nor with the intelli
</p>
<p>gence he gave Governor Tiffin of Ohio. He relates
</p>
<p>that Blennerhassett inquired of him as to the prepara
</p>
<p>tions being made up the river by Tyler and Dean for
</p>
<p>the expedition ; as to the number of &quot;men and settlers
</p>
<p>they had obtained&quot; ; that he &quot;animadverted upon the
</p>
<p>conduct pursued toward Colonel Burr at Frankfort,
</p>
<p>stating, however, his belief that such conduct was not
</p>
<p>authorized by the Government.&quot; He mentioned that
</p>
<p>Burr had bought the Bastrop lands.

</p>
<p>THE EXPEDITION 243
</p>
<p>&quot;He [ &quot;Uennerhassett] stated also,&quot; continued Graham,
</p>
<p>&quot;that he \\ AS to have an interest in his purchase, . . .
</p>
<p>that the obj ^ct of his preparations was the settlement of
</p>
<p>this land; . . . that it was a legal one, and Govern
</p>
<p>ment would htVe no right to interfere, until it was ascer
</p>
<p>tained that the&amp;gt; (meaning Colonel Burr and himself, as I
</p>
<p>understood) had an ulterior object. . . . He ad
</p>
<p>mitted, in the course of conversation, that he was building
</p>
<p>boats for the expedition in which he was engaged with
</p>
<p>Colonel Burr; that he was engaging young men, single
</p>
<p>and without families, to go down armed ; . . . that he
</p>
<p>did not solicit men to go ; that he took such only as pleased
</p>
<p>to go; that he did not expect more than three hundred
</p>
<p>men would go with him. He stated, also, that he was
</p>
<p>engaging provisions for this same expedition.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>All secrecy had been cast aside no effort was made
</p>
<p>to conceal the object for which the boats were being
</p>
<p>built, and for which provisions were being collected.
</p>
<p>They were for an expedition to the Washita lands ; but
</p>
<p>under this was another design, Blennerhassett specially
</p>
<p>mentioning to Graham the possibility of fighting the
</p>
<p>Spaniards, while &quot;an association in New Orleans for the
</p>
<p>invasion of Mexico,&quot; was referred to in a &quot;very impres
</p>
<p>sive manner.&quot; Graham says he told Blennerhassett
</p>
<p>that he thought the expedition meant to attack either
</p>
<p>the territories of the United States or those of Spain,
</p>
<p>and that in either case the Government would have to
</p>
<p>interfere. The agent visited General Neville and was
</p>
<p>told of Burr s interview with the Morgans; he con
</p>
<p>ferred also with the Hendersons, Blennerhassett s ene
</p>
<p>mies ; and the next step was to excite Governor Tiffin,
</p>
<p>who knew little or nothing of Burr and his partisans.
</p>

<p>244 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>mention the matter the next Monday in his message to
</p>
<p>the Legislature.
</p>
<p>November 28th, after his interview ^ith Tiffin in
</p>
<p>Chillicothe, then the capital of Ohio, Graham wrote
</p>
<p>Madison a letter breathing a tranquillity unexpected at
</p>
<p>a season when the Proclamation had been four and
</p>
<p>twenty hours before the world : &quot;At this place they
</p>
<p>seem to know nothing of the plans of Colonel Burr,
</p>
<p>and I am rather induced to think that he has no one
</p>
<p>at work for him here if he has, they have made very
</p>
<p>little progress, for all is quiet.&quot; The reports from Ken
</p>
<p>tucky of Burr s trial, commented Graham, had had a
</p>
<p>very different effect from what was anticipated. Burr s
</p>
<p>voluntary appearance in court had spread belief in his
</p>
<p>innocence. However, should he pursue his designs &quot;he
</p>
<p>will yet find the same real difficulties to encounter, for
</p>
<p>the great body of the people are decidedly adverse to
</p>
<p>any plan which would disturb the peace or break in
</p>
<p>upon the unity of the nation.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>December 2d Burr s case came up before the Frank

<p>foreign power, and force the West to secede. He had
</p>
<p>been informed that two boats loaded with artillery,
</p>
<p>muskets and bayonets had passed down the Ohio and
</p>
<p>that there were men on board who spoke French; but
</p>
<p>for want of legal authority they could not be arrested.
</p>
<p>Then he put the question : Shall the conspirators on the
</p>
<p>Muskingum be allowed to escape? 1
</p>
<p>The Legislature did not immediately respond to
</p>
<p>Tiffin s appeal. Only on the sixth was the requisite
</p>
<p>bill enacted into a law. It was entitled: &quot;An Act to
</p>
<p>Prevent certain Acts hostile to the Peace and Tran
</p>
<p>quillity of the United States within the Jurisdiction of
</p>
<p>the State of Ohio.&quot; The Governor forthwith sent an

<p>express to Judge Meigs and Major-General Buell at
</p>
<p>Marietta with orders to arrest the flotilla and to gather
</p>
<p>proof of the guilt of the parties concerned in the enter

<p>artillery on the bank of the Ohio; to keep patrols along
</p>
<p>the river, and to call out three hundred men to over

</p>
<p>suffered to pass unexamined. Meigs and Buell on the

<p>ninth set about the execution of their orders. They

<p>proceeded up the Muskingum, seized two hundred bar

<p>wise carried out with some degree of energy. After all,
</p>
<p>the seizure of the Muskingum flotilla was a matter of
</p>
<p>small moment to the adventurers. Had the boats es
</p>
<p>caped there were not even crews for them, much less
</p>
<p>companies of determined traitors. Those at a distance,
</p>
<p>however, saw in this capture the destruction of the
</p>
<p>weapons of the conspirators. Jefferson looked upon
</p>
<p>the affair philosophically :
</p>
<p>&quot;That our fellow citizens of the West,&quot; he repeated
</p>
<p>confidently to Tiffin, 1 &quot;would need only to be informed of
</p>
<p>criminal machinations against the public safety, to crush
</p>
<p>them at once, I never entertained a doubt. I have seen
</p>
<p>with the greatest satisfaction that among those who have
</p>
<p>distinguished themselves by their fidelity to their country,
</p>
<p>on the occasion of the enterprise of Mr. Burr, yourself, and
</p>
<p>the legislature of Ohio, have been the most eminent.&quot;
</p>
<p>December yth marked the beginning of Blennerhas-
</p>
<p>sett s misfortunes his boats on the Muskingum, which
</p>
<p>were to have been delivered that day, were seized;
</p>
<p>while from either side of the river he was menaced by
</p>
<p>the militia. Already Comfort Tyler of New York had
</p>
<p>reached the island with four boats and twenty men
</p>
<p>whom he denominated &quot;settlers.&quot; November I4th he
</p>
<p>had written Blennerhassett from Pittsburgh
</p>
<p>&quot;My calculations have at all times been to leave Beaver
</p>
<p>on the first of next month. The only difficulty that I have
</p>
<p>encountered is, the procuring the provisions necessary for
</p>
<p>my settlers, some of whom are behind, and I fear they will
</p>
<p>not arrive in time ; but I shall be off with the few that may
</p>
<p>happen to be with me, and trust to those behind to fol
</p>
<p>low on.&quot;

</p>
<p>THE EXPEDITION 247
</p>
<p>The tenth of December brought matters on the
</p>
<p>island to a crisis. The Virginia militia announced that
</p>
<p>on the morrow would come the fathoming of the island
</p>
<p>secret. Blennerhassett and Tyler were not unadvised
</p>
<p>of these plans, and as their arrangements for departure
</p>
<p>were almost completed, they decided that they should
</p>
<p>start forthwith on their perilous but inviting voyage.
</p>
<p>The early part of the evening was spent in making final
</p>
<p>preparations; by midnight everything was ready, and
</p>
<p>the lanterns which had flashed to and from the shore
</p>
<p>were extinguished and the rapid current of the Ohio
</p>
<p>bore away the adventurers.
</p>
<p>The following day Colonel Phelps with a body of
</p>
<p>militia took possession of the island, only to find it
</p>
<p>deserted! Leaving behind the bulk of his force he set
</p>
<p>out overland for the mouth of the Great Kanawha to
</p>
<p>intercept the flotilla. But while on watch the senti- | j
</p>
<p>nels, &quot;pouring spirits down to keep spirits up/ as one I
</p>
<p>wrote, fell asleep and the boats passed unnoticed.
</p>
<p>Meantime the mob of militia left on the island had cap
</p>
<p>tured a flatboat with fourteen boys aboard, all from
</p>
<p>Pittsburg and intending to join Burr. Besides this
</p>
<p>exploit the men raided the wine cellar, pulled down
</p>
<p>fences to keep the fires going, and destroyed much that
</p>
<p>had made the island a thing of beauty. Then they
</p>
<p>proceeded to try the youthful Burrites before Justices
</p>
<p>Wolf and Kencholoe for alleged crimes against the
</p>
<p>State, but the manner in which the trial was conducted
</p>
<p>made a farce of the law. 1 The prisoners were speedily

<p>family with them, pushed off once more to land a
</p>
<p>month later at Bayou Pierre.
</p>
<p>Already the news of the Proclamation was spread
</p>
<p>ing in an ever-widening circle, sweeping away the last
</p>
<p>doubt in the minds of the uninitiated as to the nature
</p>
<p>of the expedition. Its effect on society at large was
</p>
<p>tremendous it was proof positive of daring, sinister
</p>
<p>conspiracy, just as Wilkinson s letters had been to the
</p>
<p>Occupant of the White House. Jefferson had been
</p>
<p>grossly deceived and had in turn grossly deceived the
</p>
<p>masses. Not the least fatal in that long chain of
</p>
<p>circumstances was the escape of the Ohio flotilla on the
</p>
<p>eve of the appearance of the Proclamation the West
</p>
<p>erners jumped to conclusions they would not otherwise
</p>
<p>have reached, and the cumulative force of the agitations
</p>
<p>could find relief only in panic. Twice the town of Cin
</p>
<p>cinnati was tumultuous with fear. The editor of the
</p>
<p>Liberty Hall, a local newspaper, recounted that the
</p>
<p>report became current late one afternoon that three of
</p>
<p>Burr s armed boats were anchored near the city, which
</p>
<p>was soon to be attacked. At nightfall some sport-
</p>
<p>loving wag fired a bomb and the inhabitants instantly
</p>
<p>concluded that the heralded assault had begun. The
</p>
<p>officials put their wits together; the militia was called
</p>
<p>out ; the citizens organized for defense ; and a neighbor
</p>
<p>ing town was invited to lend assistance in this dire ex
</p>
<p>tremity. At last, late the following day, some one
</p>
<p>ventured near enough the vessels to learn that they
</p>
<p>belonged to a Louisville merchant and were loaded with
</p>
<p>dry goods. The editor naively suggested that they had

</p>
<p>made themselves ridiculous. He ventured the opinion
</p>
<p>THE EXPEDITION 249
</p>
<p>that Burr was playing the part of a land jobber on the
</p>
<p>Washita in conjunction with Judge Lynch, and that
</p>
<p>his project was greatly exaggerated. The Western Spy
</p>
<p>declared that Blennerhassett had passed Cincinnati
</p>
<p>with four keel boats loaded with &quot;military stores&quot; ; that
</p>
<p>many boats were being built; that the Spanish settle
</p>
<p>ments in Mexico were to be attacked ; and that 20,000
</p>
<p>men were engaged in the enterprise. 1 As a further
</p>
<p>illustration of the nervousness of society the following
</p>
<p>paragraph is in point : 2
</p>
<p>&quot;It has been for some time reported and believed at
</p>
<p>Louisville that Colonel Burr was building gunboats and
</p>
<p>ships of war at Marietta and Wheeling ; at those places it
</p>
<p>is understood that he is making great naval equipments
</p>
<p>at Louisville and Limestone; and some have believed
</p>
<p>that vast military preparations were making at all those
</p>
<p>places.&quot;
</p>
<p>Ignorance of the actual state of affairs was there
</p>
<p>fore at the bottom of the increasing excitement. The
</p>
<p>newspapers ran riot, reporting with embellishments
</p>
<p>every story of the hour nothing was too wild or ab
</p>
<p>surd for belief. 3
</p>
<p>Amid this whirl of excitement Graham left Ohio
</p>
<p>for Frankfort on hi errand of inquiry. So slow was
</p>
<p>his progress, however, the holly was displayed and the
</p>
<p>festivities of Christmas were being celebrated when he

<p>from Ohio. Several days the representatives sat behind
</p>
<p>closed doors, emerging with a law entitled, &quot;An Act to
</p>
<p>Prevent Unlawful and Warlike Enterprises.&quot; Orders
</p>
<p>were dispatched to various places on the Ohio to stop
</p>
<p>the passage of all boats, and the militia was sent to
</p>
<p>enforce the decrees of the State. It is worth while
</p>
<p>noting that in the nine clauses of the Act the name of
</p>
<p>Burr does not appear, but the denunciation of unlawful
</p>
<p>expeditions was unqualified. The penalty for the in
</p>
<p>fraction of the statute was a fine of two thousand
</p>
<p>dollars and one year s imprisonment. 1 Three weeks
</p>
<p>earlier, during Burr s second trial at Frankfort, this
</p>
<p>same Legislature had passed a series of resolutions, lest
</p>
<p>the world, a$ they expressed it, should misapprehend
</p>
<p>their attitude towards the Union: 2
</p>
<p>&quot;Be it resolved : That the people of Kentucky feel the
</p>
<p>strongest attachment for the Federal Government, and
</p>
<p>consider a dismemberment of the Union as the greatest
</p>
<p>evil which could befall them. . . . And that the peo
</p>
<p>ple of Kentucky have entire confidence in the present
</p>
<p>Administration of the general Government.&quot;
</p>
<p>From every quarter in the West came simulta
</p>
<p>neously avowals of loyalty to the Government and de
</p>
<p>fiance to traitors. While the lawmakers of Kentucky
</p>
<p>were placing themselves on record, Claiborne was warn
</p>
<p>ing the inhabitants of Louisiana against the treasonable
</p>
<p>expedition of Burr. December i6th, ignorant of the
</p>
<p>happenings along the Ohio and of the Proclamation,
</p>
<p>solely through Wilkinson s influence, Claiborne pro
</p>
<p>mulgated his denunciation against the &quot;traitorous pro-

<p>252 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>but their party is too insignificant to disturb the public
</p>
<p>tranquillity.&quot;
</p>
<p>After Burr s second vindication at Frankfort he
</p>
<p>returned to Lexington where he met General Adair;
</p>
<p>and together they rode to Nashville. December I4th
</p>
<p>they entered the capital of Tennessee, while Blenner-
</p>
<p>hassett was floating down the Ohio, and Wilkinson was
</p>
<p>making his military seizures in New Orleans. At
</p>
<p>Nashville Adair and Burr parted company, the former
</p>
<p>starting overland for New Orleans through the Indian
</p>
<p>I country, the latter going to Andrew Jackson s. 1
</p>
<p>The connection between Burr and Jackson is of
</p>
<p>more than passing interest, not only because of the
</p>
<p>prominence and marked individuality of the two char
</p>
<p>acters, but also for the light it throws on the nature of
</p>
<p>&quot; the conspiracy. Burr spent at this time when Wilkin
</p>
<p>son had been terrorizing New Orleans three weeks,
</p>
<p>while the Proclamation for a similar period had con
</p>
<p>demned the expedition eight days in and near Nash
</p>
<p>ville, chiefly with Jackson. This fact evoked serious
</p>
<p>criticism of the latter s conduct ; one of the most potent
</p>
<p>arguments urged against him in his Presidential can
</p>
<p>vass was that he had given comfort to Burr the traitor.
</p>
<p>In many quarters the episode was reviewed with viru
</p>
<p>lence, the party in power making the most extreme ac
</p>
<p>cusations. One of Jackson s correspondents, I. S. Bar-
</p>
<p>bour, writing from Culpeper, October 4, 1828, related
</p>

</p>
<p>THE EXPEDITION 253
</p>
<p>Burr charge was pressed with greater earnestness and
</p>
<p>malignity.&quot; 1 It was emphasized that Jackson sent No
</p>
<p>vember 12, 1806, a denunciation of Burr to Claj borne,
</p>
<p>and that a month later he was entertaining at his home
</p>
<p>the chief of the conspirators. It is noticeable that those
</p>
<p>writers who have satisfied themselves that this letter in
</p>
<p>criminates Jackson, publishes him to the world as deep
</p>
<p>in the conspiracy, never quote the concluding lines of
</p>
<p>that much distorted communication : &quot;I love my coun
</p>
<p>try and Government I hate the Dons I would de
</p>
<p>light to see Mexico reduced ; but I will die in the last
</p>
<p>ditch before I would yield a foot to the Dons or see
</p>
<p>the Union disunited.&quot; As a common-sense proposition
</p>
<p>how could Jackson have betrayed a plot in which he
</p>
<p>was himself vitally implicated? Jackson averred that
</p>
<p>he merely reported rumor: a certain Captain ,
</p>
<p>passing a day and a night with him, had told of the
</p>
<p>designs of the adventurers, how they plotted to divide\
</p>
<p>the Union by seizing New Orleans, to conquer Mexico, \
</p>
<p>and with the aid of the Federal troops under Wilkinson ]
</p>
<p>to effect the separation of the Western States. His/
</p>
<p>suspicions were aroused, he said, and a few days later
</p>
<p>he warned Governors Smith and Claiborne. 2 The trutjr~] j
</p>
<p>is it was Wilkinson s connection with the affair v
</p>
<p>alarmed the Tennesseean.
</p>
<p>Although Jackson had said to Claiborne in his letter
</p>
<p>of November I2th, &quot;This I write for your own eye,&quot;
</p>
<p>the Governor immediately sent a copy of it to Jefferson.

<p>possession and made, without Claiborne s knowledge, a
</p>
<p>copy of it which he used extensively. Jackson justly
</p>
<p>complained to Claiborne the next year of the publicity
</p>
<p>which had been given his private correspondence, ask
</p>
<p>ing at the same time for a copy of the letter. He did
</p>
<p>not conceal his opinion of Wilkinson s double dealing,
</p>
<p>and expressed the wish that the conspiracy should be
</p>
<p>thoroughly developed. Claiborne, however, was still
</p>
<p>impressed with the righteousness of the General, for
</p>
<p>in his reply dated December 5, 1807, he said, &quot;I am free
</p>
<p>to declare that my impressions are greatly in his [Wil
</p>
<p>kinson s] favor.&quot; His excuse for the publication of
</p>
<p>Jackson s letter read as follows:
</p>
<p>&quot;I am persuaded you will not suppose that I did, either
</p>
<p>unnecessarily or improperly, expose the contents of your
</p>
<p>communication. It reached me at an interesting crisis,
</p>
<p>and was only resorted to with a view to serve our country
</p>
<p>and Government, to which I always believed you to be
</p>
<p>ardently attached.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>Jackson s every act was one of loyalty. Although
</p>
<p>he was engaged in preparing boats for Burr, the per
</p>
<p>sistent rumors concerning the nature of the expedition
</p>
<p>led him early in December to wonder whether he had
</p>
<p>deceived. 2 Burr should at least reassure him.
</p>
<p>/ Says Davis, &quot;General Jackson addressed a letter to
</p>
<p>| Colonel Burr in which he alluded to rumors that were

<p>land to its mouth, where Blennerhassett, Davis Floyd,
</p>
<p>and the rest of the company awaited him. 1 Burr could
</p>
<p>nnow have had no other purpose in view than to begin
</p>
<p>the settlement of his Washita lands there was no
</p>
<p>other alternative. The idea which has prevailed that
</p>
<p>up to the moment of being confronted by the militia
</p>
<p>at Bayou Pierre he calculated on the cooperation of
</p>
<p>Wilkinson in an assault on New Orleans is as absurd
</p>
<p>as it would be to assert that the news of the peace with
</p>
<p>the Spaniards had required more than two months for
</p>
<p>its dissemination in the West. Nor more could he have
</p>
<p>dreamed of advancing his interests by force that he
</p>
<p>could not command, had he been so disposed.
</p>
<p>Blennerhassett, Tyler, and Smith, with their four
</p>
<p>boats, after the escape from Wood County the night
</p>
<p>of December 10-11, had met with no further obstruc
</p>
<p>tions. 2 At the falls of the Ohio, six days removed
</p>
<p>i from the island, they were joined by Davis Floyd of
</p>
<p>Indiana with three boats and thirty men. When Burr
</p>
<p>had come the formidable squadron, laden with horses,
</p>
<p>agricultural implements, provisions, and personal arms,
</p>
<p>was in complete array. There were in all nine bateaux
</p>
<p>and less than sixty men. An inconsiderable fleet :
</p>
<p>nevertheless its strength seems to have been greater
</p>
<p>than Burr anticipated, for he wrote at once to Lynch
</p>
<p>to send an increased supply of corn and additional
</p>
<p>farming implements. 3 Christmas Day he sent a note
</p>
<p>to the commander of Fort Massac, notifying him of his

</p>
<p>ing, as we have been often told, the clutches of the law.
</p>
<p>&quot;I avail myself of the opportunity of Mr. Hopkins,&quot;
</p>
<p>Burr said, &quot;to offer you salutations and the compliments
</p>
<p>of the season. Having proposed to descend the river in a
</p>
<p>few days, I shall have the pleasure of paying my respects
</p>
<p>to you on the way, and of receiving your commands for
</p>
<p>the South.&quot;
</p>
<p>The twenty-eighth of December the fleet moved
</p>
<p>down the Ohio, and the night of the twenty-ninth
</p>
<p>anchored a mile below Massac. Bissell rowed to the
</p>
<p>camp the day after the arrival of the adventurers to re
</p>
<p>turn the greetings of the ex-Vice-President and to in-L
</p>
<p>vite him to dine at the fort. But his civilities were
</p>
<p>declined. It was here, too, that Jacob Dunbaugh, who
</p>
<p>afterwards figured in the trial, joined the expedition.
</p>
<p>Having personally applied for a twenty-day furlough, j
</p>
<p>his wish was granted ; but Dunbaugh in the excitement I
</p>
<p>at the collapse of the association failed to keep his en
</p>
<p>gagement and was advertised as a deserter. He took
</p>
<p>refuge at Baton Rouge, whence Wilkinson coaxed him
</p>
<p>with a pardon to prime him as a leading State witness.
</p>
<p>His writings, leaving out of account his testimony at
</p>
<p>Richmond, show him to have been a despicable char
</p>
<p>acter. The following letter to Captain Bissell settles
</p>
<p>for all time his credibility :*

<p>&quot;With sorrow I take Pen in hand to inform you,&quot; he
</p>
<p>said briefly and bluntly, &quot;that I had to tell the officers that

<p>not know what Burr s mening was to take some men down

<p>the River with him. ... I should be thankful if my
</p>
<p>Captain would send some money if their is any for me
</p>
<p>and my Boots if my detes air paid.&quot;
</p>
<p>Meantime Graham had reached Nashville, having
</p>
<p>,-left Frankfort December 23d. Whether he brought
</p>
<p>the Proclamation with him, or whether it had already
</p>
<p>arrived, cannot be ascertained. Certain it is that it
</p>
<p>came after the departure of Burr ; it was not until
</p>
<p>January ist that Jackson received his special orders
</p>
<p>from the Secretary of War. Dearborn, under the stim
</p>
<p>ulus of popular rumor, hinted to Jackson that, knowing
</p>
<p>the secrets of the conspirators, he could strike a blow
</p>
<p>to good advantage. The Tennesseean was incensed,
</p>
<p>and, although he set about his duty manfully, he took
</p>
<p>occasion to say to Dearborn what came into his mind.
</p>
<p>One phrase is particularly characteristic and forcibly
</p>
<p>expresses Jackson s interpretation of the general tenor
</p>
<p>of the order he was expected to play the part of the
</p>
<p>&quot;smiling assassin.&quot; He deeply resented the insinua
</p>
<p>tion that he was himself a conspirator. Congressman
</p>
<p>Campbell, Jackson s friend, paid several visits to Jeffer
</p>
<p>son and Dearborn in the interest of peace. The latter
</p>
<p>avowed that no offense had been intended in the order ;
</p>
<p>that, on the contrary, because of reliance in him he had
</p>
<p>been given the utmost freedom of action ; and Jefferson,
</p>
<p>to quote Campbell s language to Jackson, declared &quot;his
</p>
<p>unshaken and unlimited confidence in your integrity.&quot;

<p>ist, ordered the mobilization of the militia; and twelve
</p>
<p>companies of volunteers were to march on the fifth
</p>
<p>under the command of Brigadier-General James Win
</p>
<p>chester. Secret messengers were sent to the mouth of
</p>
<p>the Cumberland and to Fort Massac. Jackson wrote
</p>
<p>January 2d to Captain Bissell, that he had heard that a
</p>
<p>number of boats had assembled at the mouth of the
</p>
<p>Cumberland, that they were loaded with arms and am
</p>
<p>munition, and that the expedition was hostile to the
</p>
<p>United States. Bissell was accordingly instructed to
</p>
<p>capture all parties engaged in such an enterprise, and to
</p>
<p>report what information he had concerning the number
</p>
<p>of men, their equipment, and rendezvous.
</p>
<p>January 4th, John Murrell delivered the dispatch
</p>
<p>to Bissell, who replied that he had received neither the
</p>
<p>President s Proclamation, nor the orders from the War
</p>
<p>Department; and then continued: &quot;There has not tor
</p>
<p>my knowledge been any assembling of men or boats J
</p>
<p>at this or any other place unauthorized by law or pre-j
</p>
<p>cedency.&quot; For two weeks he had made it a point to
</p>
<p>examine the cargo of all vessels descending the river,
</p>
<p>but as yet nothing alarming had been seen. He con
</p>
<p>cluded by saying that on or about the thirty-first ultimo
</p>
<p>Colonel Burr, late Vice-President, &quot;passed this way
</p>
<p>with about ten boats of different descriptions, navigated
</p>
<p>with about six men each, having nothing on board j
</p>
<p>that would even suffer a conjecture more than that he
</p>
<p>was a man bound to market. He has descended the

<p>disbanded the militia. &quot;This express returned the
</p>
<p>eighth instant,&quot; he said in an official account, &quot;whose
</p>
<p>report, together with information given by Captain
</p>
<p>Bissell, gave me pleasing news that nothing in that
</p>
<p>quarter was alarming. Under all these circumstances,
</p>
<p>added to the limited point of view in which the orders
</p>
<p>given me must be interpreted, I have deemed proper to
</p>
<p>dismiss the corps under my command.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>Thus the volunteers returned home a few days be
</p>
<p>fore Burr s flotilla pushed into Bayou Pierre. With
</p>
<p>Burr had gone Stokely Hays, Mrs. Jackson s nephew.
</p>
<p>He bore a letter of introduction from Jackson to Clai-
</p>
<p>borne, and was instructed to abandon Burr if he discov
</p>
<p>ered any thing in his conduct threatening to the United
</p>
<p>States. 2 In Jackson s mind, however, there was no
</p>
<p>question as to the aim of the associates. January 15,
</p>
<p>1807, he spoke out plainly in a confidential epistle to
</p>
<p>one of his most intimate friends : 3
</p>
<p>&quot;The late denunciation of Aaron Burr as a traitor has
</p>
<p>excited great surprise and general indignation against
</p>
<p>Burr. Still, from the opinion possessed of the accuser
</p>
<p>(Wilkinson) many there are who wait for the proof be
</p>
<p>fore they will pronounce him guilty of the charge. . . .
</p>
<p>[Then he referred to the rumor that he was on full march
</p>
<p>with Burr.] Should you ever hear that I am embarked
</p>
<p>in a cause inimical to my country, believe it not ; . . .
</p>
<p>or that I would not put any man out of existence that
</p>
<p>would name such a thing to me, without on the ground of
</p>
<p>discovering it to the proper authority, believe them not.

<p>always held out the idea of settling Washita, unless a war
</p>
<p>with Spain; in that event he held out the idea that from j
</p>
<p>his intimacy with the Secretary of War, he would obtain j
</p>
<p>an appointment ; and if he did he would revolutionize ^
</p>
<p>Mexico. . . . If he is a traitor, he is the basest that
</p>
<p>ever did commit treason, and being tore to pieces and
</p>
<p>scattered to the four winds of heaven would be too good
</p>
<p>for him.&quot;
</p>
<p>The vehemence of the language corresponded with
</p>
<p>the ingenuousness and impetuosity of Jackson s nature.
</p>
<p>At the moment he wrote, the end of the expedition
</p>
<p>was unknown; but if he ever hesitated in his judg
</p>
<p>ment of Burr, the verdict was not long in suspense.
</p>
<p>He was summoned to Richmond as a State witness,?
</p>
<p>but the attitude he assumed convinced the prosecution;
</p>
<p>that the less they had of him the better would fare
</p>
<p>their case ; so he was never put on the stand. He wrote
</p>
<p>from Richmond before the trial was well begun, &quot;I
</p>
<p>am more convinced than ever that treason was never i
</p>
<p>intended by Burr ; but if it was, you know my wishes \
</p>
<p>that he may be hung. I am still more convinced that I

<p>whatever may have been the project of Burr, James

<p>Wilkinson has gone hand and hand with him.&quot; 1 Jack-

<p>Iron-handed, inflexible, honest, Andrew Jackson, the

<p>was made at New Madrid, opposite the mouth of the

<p>Ohio ; and three days later they hauled in at Chickasaw
</p>
<p>Bluffs, now called Memphis. Lieutenant Jacob Jackson
</p>
<p>commanded the fort, and was as ignorant as Bissell at
</p>
<p>Massac of the ban which had gone forth against the
</p>
<p>filibusters. The lieutenant was indeed ready to join
</p>
<p>them on the avowal that they were bound for Mexico,
</p>
<p>and accepted money from Burr to enable him to raise
</p>
<p>a company in his service. 1 The sixth of January the
</p>
<p>fleet of flatboats moved on, and four days later they
</p>
<p>halted in Mississippi Territory, where the excitement
</p>
<p>was intense. The proclamations of Claiborne and

<p>Meade had roused the whole country against Burr,
</p>
<p>who, upon landing, issued a public letter asserting the
</p>
<p>innocence of his views : 2

<p>necessary to their satisfaction, presuming that when my

<p>views are understood, they will receive the countenance
</p>
<p>of all good men.&quot;
</p>
<p>Burr also declared to Meade, who wrote January 13,
</p>
<p>1807, to Dearborn, 3 that his designs were in no way
</p>
<p>hostile to the laws or government of the United States ;
</p>
<p>that rumors against his patriotism were false; that he

<p>was bound for the Washita lands, and that his bateaux

<p>264 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>Shortly after my arrival, I learned the plot of the incen
</p>
<p>diaries. . . . After knowing the chief object, I could
</p>
<p>not understand the means for its achievement, without
</p>
<p>which knowledge I could not take my measures to secure
</p>
<p>the possessions of the King. December ist, however, I
</p>
<p>learned that Burr had selected the mouth of the Cumber
</p>
<p>land as the point for the reunion of his forces,
</p>
<p>that Baton Rouge was the first point proposed for attack.
</p>
<p>I therefore withdrew three hundred men from the garri
</p>
<p>sons of Pensacola and Mobile for its defense.&quot;
</p>
<p>It is most significant that as early as October
</p>
<p>ist, while Burr was still busy with preliminaries and
</p>
<p>before Wilkinson, according to his story, knew of the
</p>
<p>plot, this Spaniard should have reported it hostile to
</p>
<p>his country, and that so late as February 15, 1807, he
</p>
<p>had not modified his opinion.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the Coffee House book in New
</p>
<p>Orleans, which contained many entries of note, was
</p>
<p>written January 2 ist: &quot;General Wilkinson received an
</p>
<p>express last night by which he was positively informed
</p>
<p>that Colonel Burr was at Bayou Pierre.&quot; It was also
</p>
<p>rumored that Colonel Claiborne and Captain Scott,
</p>
<p>with three hundred militia, had gone in pursuit of him.
</p>
<p>Reports were conflicting. &quot;Those at the head of affairs
</p>
<p>(we hope from motives of public safety) maintain the
</p>
<p>most profound silence,&quot; l said the Gazette. Claiborne
</p>
<p>and Wilkinson at once addressed a joint letter to the
</p>
<p>governor of Mississippi :*
</p>
<p>&quot;Understanding that Aaron Burr has taken post within
</p>

</p>
<p>so, permit us to suggest for your consideration the ex

<p>pediency of placing him without delay on board one of
</p>
<p>our armed vessels in the river, with an order to the officers

<p>to descend with him to this city. Otherwise, if his fol

<p>lowers are numerous, as they are represented to be, it is
</p>
<p>probable it may not be in your power to bring him to trial.
</p>
<p>We take this occasion to advise you confidentially to keep
</p>
<p>a strict eye upon the Spaniards. Governor Folch is to
</p>
<p>proceed to Baton Rouge with four hundred men.&quot;
</p>
<p>This advice was as unnecessary as it was a palpable
</p>
<p>attempt to keep up a show of uneasiness; Meade had
</p>
<p>already acted with promptitude and energy. December
</p>
<p>2Oth he had prorogued the Legislature; the twenty-third

<p>by men of profound intrigue for the aggrandizement of

</p>
<p>dupe and inveigle.&quot; Christmas Day W. B. Shields,
</p>
<p>aide-de-camp to the Governor, issued a general call for

</p>
<p>quickly responded to the orders of their regimental and

</p>
<p>ery in motion which was at last to put an end to the
</p>
<p>mysterious business.
</p>
<p>Tradition has it that only now Burr learned of his
</p>
<p>betrayal read in a newspaper at Judge Bruin s his
</p>
<p>letter of July 2Qth ! * But tradition is wrong. Burr
</p>
<p>knew that Wilkinson had made an agreement with the
</p>
<p>Spaniards; and knew prior to leaving Tennessee that
</p>
<p>he had occupied New Orleans. Captain Daniel Bissell
</p>
<p>testified that Burr related to him at Fort Massac &quot;that
</p>
<p>General Wilkinson had made a compromise with the
</p>
<p>Spaniards. Burr said he was very sorry for it, and that
</p>
<p>General Wilkinson ought to have fought them.&quot;
</p>
<p>Clearly Burr was unfamiliar with the details of the
</p>
<p>Sabine campaign, but he knew one thing beyond doubt,
</p>
<p>v whatever his relations had been with Wilkinson, that
</p>
<p>no further cooperation was to be expected his silence
</p>
<p>had been too profound. He was of course ignorant of
</p>
<p>the General s denunciations ; of the state of mind of the
</p>
<p>inhabitants in the lower country ; but it is folly to assert
</p>
<p>that he continued his voyage in the belief that Wilkin
</p>
<p>son was only awaiting his coming to precipitate the
</p>
<p>revolution.
</p>
<p>As soon as it was possible, a detachment of militia
</p>
<p>three hundred and seventy-five strong was sent up the
</p>
<p>river from Natchez and posted at the mouth of Cole s
</p>
<p>Creek to prevent the egress of Burr s flotilla. Meade
</p>
<p>and his staff marched up the river by land, and on the
</p>
<p>sixteenth Poindexter, the United States attorney for
</p>
<p>(iii., 325) relates this story, which has become classic.
</p>
<p>He adds: &quot;From the moment Burr saw himself denounced by
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, his only hope was to escape.&quot;

<p>Shields presented a letter from the Governor, in which

<p>he attributed to Burr hostile intentions against the ter

<p>saying that he would have gone to Natchez to see the

<p>Governor had it not been for reports abroad and his
</p>
<p>fear of assassination. He pointed to his boats, and
</p>
<p>asked if there was anything warlike in their appearance.
</p>
<p>When told that the militia of the territory had orders
</p>
<p>to stop him, he replied that he was willing to submit to

<p>the civil authorities. An interview with Governor

<p>268 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>Early next morning Colonel Burr was rowed down
</p>
<p>from his camp. He alighted and was escorted by
</p>
<p>a company of dragoons to Thomas Calvit s place, 1
</p>
<p>whither Meade had come the previous evening. The
</p>
<p>interview was uneventful and resulted
</p>
<p>&quot;in a voluntary submission on the part of Colonel Burr to
</p>
<p>the civil authorities of the Territory, and also in a sur
</p>
<p>render of whatever military apparatus might be found on
</p>
<p>board the boats under his direction ; a committee was im
</p>
<p>mediately appointed to make the necessary examination,
</p>
<p>and report forthwith to the Governor the number and
</p>
<p>description of such military stores as they might discover
</p>
<p>on board said boats.&quot; 2
</p>
<p>The ensuing day, leaving behind his associates, who
</p>
<p>were shortly to move down the river to a point near
</p>
<p>Natchez, Burr rode with Shields and Poindexter to the
</p>
<p>town of Washington, the capital of the Territory,
</p>
<p>where he came before Judge Rodney, who bound him
</p>
<p>over in the sum of $5,000 to await the action of the
</p>
<p>grand jury. Colonel Benijah Osmun and Lyman Hard
</p>
<p>ing acted as sureties. At the same time Colonel Fitz-
</p>
<p>patrick, with three officers and a squad of men, was
</p>
<p>vainly searching the boats for accoutrements, muni
</p>
<p>tions and arms of war. Meade thus summarized the
</p>
<p>situation to the Government:
</p>
<p>&quot;Then, Sir, this mighty alarm, with all its exaggera-
</p>
<p>tions, has eventuated in nine boats and one hundred men,
</p>
<p>and the major part of these are boys, or young men just
</p>
<p>from school. Many of their depositions have been taken

<p>before Judge Rodney, but they bespeak ignorance of the

</p>
<p>ignorant and deluded. I believe that they are really the
</p>
<p>dupes of stratagem, if the asseverations of Generals Eaton
</p>
<p>and Wilkinson are to be accredited.&quot;
</p>
<p>Meade was looking squarely at the question from a
</p>
<p>vantage point not to be gainsaid. Here at the collapse,
</p>
<p>with Burr a civil prisoner, his followers disheartened
</p>
<p>and dispersed, to confess that no man could be found
</p>
<p>to give warrant to their fears was, in very truth, most
</p>
<p>lamentable. In any case could the adventurers have
</p>
<p>been &quot;dupes of stratagem? &quot; Had three score of men
</p>
<p>united with no purpose in view ? If treasonable, when
</p>
<p>pardons and even rewards were freely offered those
</p>
<p>who knew of the plot and who were confessed to have
</p>
<p>held in abhorrence the name of traitor, is it not reason
</p>
<p>able to suppose that some could have been found to fix
</p>
<p>the crime indelibly? Wilkinson plied his energies in
</p>
<p>such a quest, but James Knox, Lindsey, and Dunbaugh
</p>
<p>were the best he could get, while only the last, simple-
</p>
<p>minded and ignorant, advertised as a deserter and fear

<p>ful of the penalties, became a willing tool.

<p>CHAPTER X.
</p>
<p>Burr s Trial in Mississippi.
</p>
<p>*
</p>
<p>FOR a fortnight after his surrender at Bayou
</p>
<p>Pierre, while awaiting trial, Aaron Burr made
</p>
<p>the most of his liberty. He had promised to re
</p>
<p>main in the Territory until everything was cleared up
</p>
<p>to the satisfaction of the most exacting. He would then
</p>
<p>remove to his lands. The excitement which had been
</p>
<p>occasioned by his arrival soon subsided and left the
</p>
<p>people his friends. Moreover, his cause was abetted by
</p>
<p>the accounts rendered by the associates, who unequivo
</p>
<p>cally asserted the innocence of their designs toward the
</p>
<p>United States. Burr also talked eloquently of his
</p>
<p>wrongs, and won the sympathy of the community.
</p>
<p>&quot;He became the guest,&quot; says Claiborne, 1 &quot;of Colonel
</p>
<p>Benijah Osmun, a wealthy planter residing in the vicinity.
</p>
<p>He was a bachelor and had been an officer in the Jersey
</p>
<p>line, and intimate with Burr. He was a Federalist. Near
</p>
<p>by Colonel Osmun resided another military friend of
</p>
<p>similar political opinion, the veteran Major Isaac Guion,
</p>
<p>and with these two, and other influential gentlemen, he
</p>
<p>had daily consultations. No sterner and truer patriots
</p>
<p>lived than these two veteran soldiers, and they reposed
</p>
<p>unshaken faith in the friend whom they had seen so often
</p>
<p>tested in the time that tried men s souls/ &quot;

<p>supreme court of the Mississippi Territory was held in
</p>
<p>the town of Washington, before which Aaron Burr
</p>
<p>was recognized to appear to answer such bill of indict
</p>
<p>ment as might then and there be exhibited against him.
</p>
<p>The accused was present and surrounded by a con
</p>
<p>course of friends. As soon as the grand jury was
</p>
<p>impaneled Mr. Poindexter, the United States attor
</p>
<p>ney, after an examination of the depositions submitted
</p>
<p>by the court, moved its discharge. He argued that he
</p>
<p>found no evidence which brought the offenses charged
</p>
<p>against Colonel Burr within the jurisdiction of the
</p>
<p>courts of Mississippi Territory ; and furthermore, that
</p>
<p>the supreme court of the Territory was a court of appeal
</p>
<p>and not a court of original jurisdiction. It could,
</p>
<p>therefore, take no cognizance of the cause. The motion
</p>
<p>was overruled, however, and the grand jury began its
</p>
<p>work. The next day to the astonishment of the judges
</p>
<p>it filed in and made the following report : l

<p>&quot;The grand jury of the Mississippi Territory, on a due

<p>States or of this Territory, or given any just occasion
</p>
<p>for alarm or inquietude to the good people of this Terri

<p>military expedition unnecessarily as they conceive, fitted

<p>out against the person and property of said Aaron Burr,
</p>
<p>where no resistance has been made to the ordinary civil

<p>authorities. The grand jury also present as highly de

</p>
<p>and if sanctioned by the Executive of our country, must
</p>
<p>sap the vitals of our political existence, and crumble this
</p>
<p>glorious fabric into the dust.&quot;
</p>
<p>Historically considered, this return is a most un
</p>
<p>compromising document. For months the Aaron Burr
</p>
<p>enterprise had been almost the sole topic of conversa
</p>
<p>tion; it had assumed various characters in the public
</p>
<p>mind, but chiefly through the agency of Wilkinson,
</p>
<p>Eaton, and Jefferson it had come to be condemned as
</p>
<p>most dangerous and treasonable. Such, indeed, it had
</p>
<p>been believed to be by the militia of Mississippi when
</p>
<p>they volunteered; and such it had been believed to be
</p>
<p>by the Legislature of the Territory when it declared its
</p>
<p>unfeigned allegiance to the Constitution. Two weeks
</p>
<p>intervened between Burr s surrender and the day set
</p>
<p>for his examination. This ought to have allowed time
</p>
<p>for the collection of all the evidence, and Judge Rod
</p>
<p>ney, according to Meade, had taken many affidavits.
</p>
<p>How, then, account for the report ? Adams attributes it
</p>
<p>to sympathy in Burr s designs, 1 and says that the very
</p>
<p>militia that stopped him was half inclined to join his
</p>
<p>expedition, and that a score of civil and military offi
</p>
<p>cials alone prevented Burr from reaching New Orleans !
</p>
<p>But in truth had they sympathized with him, knowing
</p>
<p>that he planned the extension of an empire over the

<p>West, is it to be supposed that a corporal s guard of

<p>wise, was not their sympathy enlisted because they now

<p>knew him to be armed against the Spaniards? And
</p>
<p>could not the report of the grand jury have been addi

<p>tional proof of their loyalty? The contradiction lies
</p>
<p>not in the conduct of the people, but in the story which
</p>
<p>has been transmitted to us.
</p>
<p>Wednesday afternoon, the fourth of February, the
</p>
<p>grand jury was dismissed, whereupon Burr demanded
</p>
<p>release from his recognizance. This Rodney refused
</p>
<p>to grant, and bound him over to appear from day to
</p>
<p>day, which was an unheard-of proceeding. Burr had
</p>
<p>given bond to await an investigation. No indictment
</p>
<p>had been found ; therefore, from the nature of the case,
</p>
<p>his recognition was null and void. Already the rumor
</p>
<p>had spread that Governor Williams, who had returned
</p>
<p>at this juncture from a visit to North Carolina and had
</p>
<p>superseded Meade, intended to seize Burr the moment
</p>
<p>he was discharged by the judicial authority; 1 and the
</p>
<p>report was current that a military patrol was coming
</p>
<p>up from New Orleans with the same purpose in view.
</p>
<p>It would be an interesting study to follow the de
</p>
<p>vices adopted by Wilkinson in his endeavor to secure
</p>
<p>the chief figure in the closing act of this involved
</p>
<p>drama. Dr. Carmichael, Lieutenant Peter, Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Jones, and Captain Shaw of the navy, Colonel McKee,

<p>and three officers in disguise were sent at various times

</p>
<p>&quot;cut off&quot; the leaders? Clearly Wilkinson hoped for
</p>
<p>one of two things resistance on the part of the asso
</p>
<p>ciates, or the death of Burr. Had his men defied the
</p>
<p>troops, or had Burr been slain while resisting a military
</p>
<p>process, the charge of treason would have been stamped
</p>
<p>in blood and Wilkinson s cause sanctified. Burr was
</p>
<p>not ignorant of the schemes of the tyrant of New Or
</p>
<p>leans; he was convinced, too, that his personal safety
</p>
<p>depended on escaping the power of the General, who, it
</p>
<p>has been well said, might have brought him at once to
</p>
<p>a drum-head court-martial, and who had every motive
</p>
<p>to pursue such a course; who had indeed offered five
</p>
<p>thousand dollars for his life.
</p>
<p>The matter was thoroughly canvassed with Osmun
</p>
<p>and other confidential friends, and under the circum
</p>
<p>stances it was decided that Burr should go into hiding
</p>
<p>for a time to await developments. On the sixth Gov
</p>
<p>ernor Williams proclaimed that Aaron Burr, bound in
</p>
<p>the sum of five thousand dollars to appear before the
</p>
<p>supreme court of the Territory, had forfeited his bond
</p>
<p>and fled ; and offered accordingly for his apprehension
</p>
<p>a reward of two thousand dollars. 2 Meantime Burr

<p>276 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>had Written the Governor saying that because of the
</p>
<p>&quot;vindictive temper and unprincipled conduct of Judge
</p>
<p>Rodney he withdrew for the present from the public,&quot;
</p>
<p>but that he continued ready to submit to the civil law
</p>
<p>when he could be assured the rights of a citizen. On
</p>
<p>the twelfth, replying to the Governor s proclamation
</p>
<p>and offer of reward, Burr wrote from his hiding place
</p>
<p>to Williams that it was unworthy of him to lend his
</p>
<p>name to a falsehood, that the recognition he gave was
</p>
<p>to appear in case an indictment was found not other
</p>
<p>wise.
</p>
<p>&quot;The judicial form,&quot; he continued, 1 &quot;was agreed to by
</p>
<p>Judge Rodney after nearly an hour s discussion between
</p>
<p>Bruin, Harding, and myself; drawn up at his request by
</p>
<p>Mr. Harding, and signed by the judge in our presence
</p>
<p>and that of Colonel Osmun, and will be found in the hand
</p>
<p>writing of Mr. Harding, so signed unless for fraudulent
</p>
<p>purposes the judge should have destroyed it. If he shall
</p>
<p>deny these facts, he must be lost to shame as to principle.
</p>
<p>If he shall admit them or they shall be otherwise estab
</p>
<p>lished to your satisfaction, it is hoped that you will feel it
</p>
<p>to be your duty by a public manifesto to cancel your
</p>
<p>proclamation and to acknowledge the error on which it
</p>
<p>has been founded.&quot;
</p>
<p>Williams replied, &quot;I can only say that from the
</p>
<p>judicial proceedings in this Territory you cannot be
</p>
<p>considered in any other light than as a fugitive from
</p>
<p>the laws of your country.&quot; 2
</p>
<p>Burr now despaired of relief. Judge Rodney s ille
</p>
<p>gal acts were reinforced by the Executive of the Terri-

<p>tory, while the ever-pressing danger at New Orleans
</p>
<p>urged a speedy escape from the country. Once more
</p>
<p>he visited the disheartened men who remained with the
</p>
<p>boats which were anchored a short distance above
</p>
<p>Natchez. In the words of a State witness i 1
</p>
<p>&quot;He said that what property there was the men might
</p>
<p>sell, and make the most they could of; and if there was
</p>
<p>not enough to satisfy them, they might go to the Washita
</p>
<p>lands, and take up what land they wanted, and go to work
</p>
<p>upon it. The boats and provisions were taken to Natchez,
</p>
<p>and part of them sold, and part of the provisions stored
</p>
<p>which would not readily sell, and the money divided
</p>
<p>among the men.&quot;
</p>
<p>It was with a heavy heart that the sometime Vice-
</p>
<p>President of the United States confessed to his fol
</p>
<p>lowers, &quot;that he stood his trial and was acquitted ; but
</p>
<p>that they were going to take him again, and that he was
</p>
<p>going to flee from oppression.&quot; 2 It has been asserted
</p>
<p>over and over again that his flight was a proof of guilt.
</p>
<p>The answer is that Burr never attempted to avoid
</p>
<p>an investigation by the legal authorities. The excesses
</p>
<p>of Wilkinson had reached such appalling extremes, it
</p>
<p>is no wonder that Burr feared the rattle of military
</p>
<p>chains, or even death. His intimate friends, the men of
</p>
<p>wealth and influence of the countryside, were of the
</p>
<p>opinion that safety lay only in flight. So, mounted on
</p>
<p>Colonel Osmun s fleetest horse and accompanied by
</p>
<p>Chester Ashley he set out from his hiding place near
</p>
<p>the home of the Colonel who had so kindly befriended
</p>
<p>him. Tradition has it that he took leave last of Mada-

</p>
<p>his short stay of three weeks in Mississippi he had be
</p>
<p>come enamored of her, whom Claiborne pronounced &quot;a
</p>
<p>miracle of beauty.&quot; Burr s passion was returned, and
</p>
<p>only from Paris did he write releasing her from a
</p>
<p>promise of marriage. Fiction one may say, but it is
</p>
<p>vouched for by the historian of Mississippi and at
</p>
<p>least it may be admitted as an interlude in the desolate
</p>
<p>waste of blighted hopes which spread before him who
</p>
<p>had for four years been Vice-President of the Republic.
</p>
<p>Disguised, Wilkinson tells us, in &quot;an old blanket
</p>
<p>coat begirt with a leathern strap, to which a tin cup
</p>
<p>was suspended on the left and a scalping knife on the
</p>
<p>right,&quot; Burr disappeared. It is generally asserted that
</p>
<p>he meant to seek shelter within the Spanish lines; but
</p>
<p>such a course could have been chosen only in despera
</p>
<p>tion and that point Burr never reached in his long
</p>
<p>life of successes and failures. Wilkinson was of the
</p>
<p>opinion that &quot;Burr s destination was France beyond all
</p>
<p>doubt.&quot; 1 In any case, certain it is he preferred any
</p>
<p>refuge to New Orleans ; he knew that one who could act
</p>
<p>as Wilkinson had not yet exhausted his store of villain
</p>
<p>ies. Whatever Burr s plans were the elements conspired
</p>
<p>to defeat him ; the heavy winter rains had swollen the
</p>
<p>streams so that his course had to be changed. They
</p>
<p>were obliged late at night, the eighteenth day of Febru

</p>
<p>pected that one of . the horsemen was Burr, reported
</p>
<p>the matter to Sheriff Brightwell. The two followed to
</p>
<p>Hinson s where suspicion became so strong that Per
</p>
<p>kins rode to Fort Stoddert to enlist Lieutenant Gaines
</p>
<p>in the pursuit. With four soldiers he joined the informer
</p>
<p>and they rode back the next morning to intercept the
</p>
<p>fugitives. At an early hour, within two or three miles
</p>
<p>of Hinson s they encountered Burr, Ashley and the
</p>
<p>sheriff. Gaines demanded in the name of the Govern
</p>
<p>ment of the United States whether this were Colonel
</p>
<p>Burr. Burr readily admitted his identity, whereupon
</p>
<p>he was &quot;arrested&quot; and taken to Fort Stoddert, 1 where
</p>
<p>preparations were carefully made to convey him to
</p>
<p>Washington.
</p>
<p>The presence of Burr in the fort gave its com
</p>
<p>mander some uneasiness. In a letter to Wilkinson
</p>
<p>Gaines stated that Ashley had not been arrested, and
</p>
<p>that he feared he would return with a force to retake
</p>
<p>Burr.
</p>
<p>&quot;They will assuredly find the inhabitants,&quot; said
</p>
<p>Gaines, 2 &quot;such as they could wish. Ashley has made a
</p>
<p>wonderful effect on many of them the plans of Burr are
</p>
<p>now spoken of in terms of approbation, and Burr in terms
</p>
<p>of sympathy and regard. I am convinced if Burr had
</p>
<p>remained here a week longer the consequences would have
</p>
<p>been of the most serious nature. Burr frequently, when
</p>
<p>on the subject of the Spanish aggressions, observed : And

<p>cised Gaines for the manner in which he arrested Burr.
</p>
<p>The feelings of the community were expressed in a
</p>
<p>memorial to the Government, and the young lieutenant
</p>
<p>thought it advisable to deny to Jefferson that he had ar
</p>
<p>rested Burr &quot;militarily.&quot; He was inclined to shift the
</p>
<p>burden on Perkins, 1 who at that very moment was in
</p>
<p>Washington with $3,331 in his pocket as a reward for
</p>
<p>bringing Burr safely to Richmond.
</p>
<p>At Natchez the Burrites were received with unusual
</p>
<p>kindness they were no longer suspected of being des
</p>
<p>perate characters, ripe for fratricidal strife. Says Clai-
</p>
<p>borne, who was almost an eye witness : 2
</p>
<p>&quot;Most of his followers were young men, innocent of
</p>
<p>any hostile intention against government, innocent of the
</p>
<p>object of their leader, whom they followed for the mere
</p>
<p>love of adventure. They dispersed themselves through
</p>
<p>the territory and supplied it with school masters, singing
</p>
<p>masters, dancing masters, clerks, tavern keepers, and
</p>
<p>doctors.&quot;
</p>
<p>Singularly enough, Graham, after his long pursuit
</p>
<p>of Burr even as far as the town of Washington, was
</p>
<p>compelled to bear strange witness :
</p>
<p>&quot;I am sorry to say,&quot; he wrote February 8th to Madi
</p>
<p>son, 8 &quot;that since my arrival in this Territory I have met
</p>
<p>with many people who either openly or indirectly attack
</p>
<p>the government for not countenancing Colonel Burr in
</p>
<p>the invasion of Mexico, for it is generally considered here
</p>
<p>that that was his object. I am well persuaded that most

<p>of his followers were of this opinion.&quot;

<p>ciates of Burr, the coterie of officers of the govern
</p>
<p>ment continued to harass them. About the time of
</p>
<p>Burr s disappearance probably sixty of his followers
</p>
<p>and friends were made prisoners in Natchez. 1 This
</p>
<p>wholesale arrest was occasioned by the discovery of a
</p>
<p>note alleged to have been taken from the cape worn by
</p>
<p>a negro boy. The note, dated February ist, and said
</p>
<p>to have been addressed to Tyler and Floyd, ran as fol
</p>
<p>lows : 2
</p>
<p>&quot;If you are yet together, keep together, and I will join
</p>
<p>you to-morrow night. In the meantime, put all your arms
</p>
<p>in perfect order. Ask the bearer no questions, but tell
</p>
<p>him all you may think I wish to know. He does not know
</p>
<p>that this is from me, nor where I am.&quot;
</p>
<p>This was a malicious fabrication ; falsity appears on
</p>
<p>its face no explanation, no original, nobody to claim
</p>
<p>the honor of its interception. Moreover, the impostor
</p>
<p>who wrote it was not aware that the trial of Burr at the
</p>
<p>town of Washington had not yet begun ! And this fact,
</p>
<p>too, has been overlooked by some of those who lay great

<p>stress on the import of the above document. In the

<p>whole affair there is not a more despicable piece of testi

<p>mony, unless, indeed, it be that wherein Dunbaugh
</p>
<p>swore that he had witnessed in the dead of night the
</p>
<p>sinking by Burr of his chests of arms in the Mississippi.

</p>
<p>nounced a most loyal judge. Blennerhassett was the
</p>
<p>first examined, and although the judge had said he
</p>
<p>thought the conspirators might be tried in any United
</p>
<p>States court, he bound him over to that of Virginia,
</p>
<p>knowing that his family was with him and that it
</p>
<p>meant great privation and inconvenience for him to
</p>
<p>make his way across the continent. Toulmin s osten
</p>
<p>sible reason for his action was that a prosecution car
</p>
<p>ried on against him in Mississippi &quot;must of necessity
</p>
<p>u terminate in an idle parade.&quot; 1 Floyd and Ralston
</p>
<p>wished to be tried in Indiana, where they lived ; there
</p>
<p>fore the judge assigned them to the courts of Missis
</p>
<p>sippi. Anything for annoyance. Tyler was to have
</p>
<p>been tried February 1 5th, and that day Toulmin wrote,
</p>
<p>&quot;I am strongly inclined to think him entirely innocent.&quot;
</p>
<p>January 23d, Tyler had avowed to Lieutenant Stark
</p>
<p>that he was conscious of the purity of his motives, that
</p>
<p>he respected the laws and government of the United
</p>
<p>States, and that treason had never entered his mind.
</p>
<p>Floyd had been an honored citizen of the Northwest
</p>
<p>Territory, and now that he was accused of being a
</p>
<p>traitor Governor Harrison spoke with unhesitating
</p>
<p>frankness in his favor :
</p>
<p>&quot;I have been intimately acquainted with this gentle
</p>
<p>man for six years,&quot; the Governor wrote to the President,*
</p>
<p>&quot;and I can truly affirm that there is not a man in the ter

</p>
<p>While the unfortunate filibusters were being
</p>
<p>disposed of by Toulmin, Louis Kerr and Judge James
</p>
<p>Workman, two of Wilkinson s suspected traitors, were,
</p>
<p>at the bar of the United States court in Natchez. March
</p>
<p>2d Kerr was arraigned on a charge of having set
</p>
<p>on foot a military expedition against the Spanish pos
</p>
<p>sessions in America. The trial lasted two days the
</p>
<p>verdict was, &quot;Not Guilty.&quot; Judge Workman, who had
</p>
<p>been compelled to resign the judgship of the County
</p>
<p>court of Orleans because of Wilkinson s insults, was
</p>
<p>charged with high misdemeanor in having planned an
</p>
<p>expedition for the conquest of Mexico. Again the ver
</p>
<p>dict was, &quot;Not Guilty.&quot; 1 Strange to say, neither was
</p>
<p>accused of treason. The result could not have been dif

<p>ferent; it was indeed a waste of time to attempt the

<p>conviction of men who were guilty of no other offense

<p>than plotting to overrun certain provinces of New

<p>disposed, as we are even in this day, to overlook any

<p>such movement so long as an enemy is injured.

<p>Measures in Washington.
</p>
<p>FOR SOME time after the receipt of Wilkinson s
</p>
<p>confounding letters and the Proclamation of No
</p>
<p>vember 27th, which they occasioned, the Gov
</p>
<p>ernment manifested no uneasiness concerning the en
</p>
<p>terprise in the West. December ist Congress assem
</p>
<p>bled, and the next day the annual Message was read,
</p>
<p>which devoted but few words to Burr s project. The
</p>
<p>President said his information concerning it was
</p>
<p>&quot;chiefly in the form of letters, often containing such a
</p>
<p>mixture of rumors, conjectures, and suspicions as
</p>
<p>[rendered] it difficult to sift out the real facts.&quot; In
</p>
<p>October when the General sent the letter which called
</p>
<p>out the Proclamation he also inclosed his secret views
</p>
<p>which looked upon the movement as probably double-
</p>
<p>natured. But the President, acting only on the strength
</p>
<p>of the official communication, said in his Message that
</p>
<p>he had &quot;received information that in another part of
</p>
<p>the United States a great number of private individuals
</p>
<p>were combining together, arming and organizing them
</p>
<p>selves contrary to law, to carry on a military expedi
</p>
<p>tion against the territories of Spain.&quot; He had conse
</p>
<p>quently issued his Proclamation as an act of good faith
</p>
<p>toward Spain, and in order that the conspirators might
</p>
<p>not decide the question of peace or war for the country.

<p>marcation which was not true. Wilkinson s decep
</p>
<p>tion had made possible such a misstatement of fact.
</p>
<p>In this connection Jefferson took occasion to praise
</p>
<p>the conduct of the inhabitants of Mississippi and Loui
</p>
<p>siana :
</p>
<p>&quot;I inform you with great pleasure of the promptitude
</p>
<p>with which the inhabitants of those Territories have
</p>
<p>tendered their services in defense of their country. It has
</p>
<p>done honor to themselves, entitled them to the confidence
</p>
<p>of their fellow citizens in every part of the Union, and
</p>
<p>must strengthen the general determination to protect them
</p>
<p>efficaciously under all circumstances which may occur.&quot;
</p>
<p>Every word was deserved. Jefferson s view of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy thus far was entirely correct; he showed
</p>
<p>his political insight in placing it on a par with Mi
</p>
<p>randa s scheme, and in saying that the Westerners
</p>
<p>might be relied on in every instance where patriotism
</p>
<p>and honor were involved.
</p>
<p>&quot;I am confident,&quot; Jefferson said to Rodney, 1 &quot;he
</p>
<p>[Burr] will be completely deserted on the appearance
</p>
<p>of the Proclamation, because his strength was to con
</p>
<p>sist of the people who had been persuaded that the
</p>
<p>Government connived at the enterprise.&quot;
</p>
<p>It was indeed possible that Burr persuaded the
</p>
<p>Westerners to join him under the plea that the Govern
</p>
<p>ment connived at his hostile intentions against the
</p>
<p>Spanish possessions ; but it would be the acme of
</p>
<p>absurdity to maintain that he won them to himself by

<p>even Jefferson was destined to doubt for a day the

<p>unswerving fidelity of the West.
</p>
<p>The month of December wore on at Washington
</p>
<p>bringing little additional news of the expedition. While
</p>
<p>Jefferson fully believed that his Proclamation would
</p>
<p>put an end to the expedition and in this he was not |
</p>
<p>mistaken the constant agitation at last half convinced \
</p>
<p>him that the dangers were greater than he had calcu

<p>lated. December 2Oth Robert Smith, Secretary of the

<p>Navy, sent orders to Captain Shaw, who commanded
</p>
<p>the squadron before New Orleans, to place his boats in
</p>
<p>the best position to effect the destruction of Burr s
</p>
<p>forces. 1 But Smith was not satisfied with this. He
</p>
<p>thought it necessary to write the President at length
</p>
<p>showing the measures he had meant to urge : 2
</p>
<p>&quot;In the course of our various communications in rela
</p>
<p>tion to the movements of Colonel Burr in the Western
</p>
<p>country, I have from time to time expressed the opinions
</p>
<p>which, as they were not at all countenanced by any of the
</p>
<p>other gentlemen, I did not deem it expedient to press upon
</p>
<p>your attention. ... If, as was proposed on the twenty-
</p>
<p>fourth of October, the sloops-of-war and the gunboats
</p>
<p>stationed at Washington, New York, Norfolk, and
</p>
<p>Charleston had been sent to New Orleans under the com
</p>
<p>mand of Commodore Preble, with Captain Decatur second
</p>
<p>in command, we would at this time have nothing to appre
</p>
<p>hend from the military expedition of Colonel Burr. Such
</p>
<p>a naval force joined to the ketches and gunboats now on
</p>
<p>the Mississippi, would beyond a doubt have been sufficient
</p>
<p>to suppress such an enterprise.&quot;

<p>288 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>Jefferson was prompt in his reply, 1 and now for the
</p>
<p>first time developed symptoms of panic.
</p>
<p>&quot;What I had myself in contemplation,&quot; he said, &quot;was
</p>
<p>to wait till we get news from Louisville of December fif
</p>
<p>teenth, the day of Burr s proposed general rendezvous.
</p>
<p>The post comes from thence in twelve days. The mail
</p>
<p>next expected will be of that date. If we then find that
</p>
<p>his force has had no effectual opposition at either Marietta
</p>
<p>or Cincinnati, and will not be stopped at Louisville, then,
</p>
<p>without depending on the opposition at Fort Adams
</p>
<p>(though I have more dependence on that than any other),
</p>
<p>I should propose to lay the whole matter before Congress,
</p>
<p>ask an immediate appropriation for a naval equipment,
</p>
<p>and at the same time order twenty thousand militia, or
</p>
<p>volunteers, from the Western States to proceed down the
</p>
<p>river to retake New Orleans, presuming our naval equip
</p>
<p>ment would be there before them. In the meantime I
</p>
<p>would recommend to you to be getting ready and giving
</p>
<p>orders of preparation to the officers and vessels which we
</p>
<p>can get speedily ready.&quot;
</p>
<p>Jefferson without involving himself in a maze of
</p>
<p>contradictions could not have thought the danger great,
</p>
<p>if he calculated on being able to muster twenty thou
</p>
<p>sand militia in the region which had given birth to the
</p>
<p>conspiracy. The day before, he had written Governor
</p>
<p>Langdon in an unusually confident tone. 2 He outlined
</p>
<p>to him that Burr had planned to seize New Orleans, at
</p>
<p>tack Mexico, and to add to this Louisiana and the
</p>
<p>Western States. This would make up his empire. &quot;I
</p>
<p>do not believe he will attain the crown,&quot; continued the

<p>President, &quot;but neither am I certain that the halter will

<p>get its due.&quot; It was still his opinion that the Western

</p>
<p>January 2d Wilkinson s mendacious letter of No
</p>
<p>vember 1 2th from Minor s Seat reached the White ,
</p>
<p>House. Besides this the messenger gave an oral ac
</p>
<p>count of Burr s cipher letter. Even then Jefferson did
</p>
<p>not lose his equanimity. News reached him, too, that
</p>
<p>a war vessel of twenty-two guns was fitting out in New

<p>York harbor under the command of one Blakely, lieu
</p>
<p>tenant to Miranda, to go to the assistance of Burr.
</p>
<p>January 4th the President reported to Gallatin that he
</p>
<p>had ordered Blakely to be arrested and the authorities
</p>
<p>to search out the ship. 1 He took no other measure, how
</p>
<p>ever, even with Wilkinson s foreboding letters before
</p>
<p>him. He was warranted in this, for the Western mail
</p>
<p>had brought news that most of Burr s boats had been
</p>
<p>seized, that only six had escaped. What had the fleet
</p>
<p>of ketches before New Orleans to fear from a settler s

<p>country seemed to go Burr-mad ; and until Wilkinson s

<p>venal letters and Eaton s corrupt deposition convinced

<p>him that Burr had really been guilty of plotting a sepa

<p>ration of the States. If their story were true, then

<p>Aaron Burr s enterprise was &quot;the most extraordinary

<p>since the days of Don Quixote.&quot;

<p>&quot;It is so extraordinary,&quot; Jefferson wrote January nth

<p>Orleans as the instrument of compulsion for our Western
</p>
<p>States. I think his undertaking effectually crippled by the
</p>
<p>activity of Ohio. Whether Kentucky will give him the
</p>
<p>coup de grace is doubtful ; but if he is able to descend the
</p>
<p>river with any means, we are sufficiently prepared at New
</p>
<p>Orleans. I hope, however, that Kentucky will do its duty
</p>
<p>and finish the matter for the honor of popular govern
</p>
<p>ment, and the discouragement of all arguments for stand
</p>
<p>ing armies.&quot;
</p>
<p>The Palladium would have replied to that exposi
</p>
<p>tion in this wise i 1
</p>
<p>&quot;Believing him [Burr] to be a man of common sense
</p>
<p>at least (and by many his abilities are estimated highly),
</p>
<p>he would surely adapt the means to the end. And can it
</p>
<p>be supposed he has done so, if his object is to attack Mex
</p>
<p>ico, dismember the Union, and erect an independent em
</p>
<p>pire, by building a few boats on the Ohio and by a few
</p>
<p>secret emissaries scattered over the Western country?
</p>
<p>The physical force to do this lies with the people, and to
</p>
<p>command it, public opinion must be with him. Perhaps it
</p>
<p>would not be going too far to say that nine-tenths of the
</p>
<p>Western people would oppose such a project, satisfied as
</p>
<p>they are with the administration of the government of
</p>
<p>the Union, and the present happy situation of public
</p>
<p>affairs.&quot;
</p>
<p>But the force of this argument would have failed
</p>
<p>to penetrate the armor of the President, who, while
</p>
<p>outwardly professing faith in the loyalty of the fron
</p>
<p>tiersmen, regarded the capture of the boats on the Mus-
</p>
<p>kingum as the master-stroke in the crippling of the en
</p>
<p>terprise. One may justly infer from Jefferson s frame
</p>
<p>of mind that the project failed for the want of the ap
</p>
<p>pliances of war not for lack of the spirit of sedition.

</p>
<p>disposed to deride the movement ; the newspapers, how
</p>
<p>ever, teemed with &quot;rumors dangerous to the peace and
</p>
<p>safety of the Union,&quot; and some individuals high in
</p>
<p>office were expressing their apprehensions :
</p>
<p>&quot;I fear that Burr will go down the river,&quot; Samuel
</p>
<p>Smith wrote 1 to W. C. Nicholas, &quot;and give us trouble.
</p>
<p>The proclamation, it seems, in the Western country is
</p>
<p>very little attended to. They, no doubt, seeing no exertion *
</p>
<p>making, consider that it has originated from false infor
</p>
<p>mation. The President has not yet given any kind of
</p>
<p>information to Congress, and gentlemen ( Giles among the
</p>
<p>number) will not believe that there is any kind of danger.
</p>
<p>Burr s letter to Wilkinson is explicit. (This is
</p>
<p>secret.) He had passed the Alleghany never, never to re
</p>
<p>turn ; his object, New Orleans, open and avowed. And
</p>
<p>yet not one step taken, except the proclamation ! &quot;
</p>
<p>Smith, like many others, jumped to conclusions in
</p>
<p>basing treason on Burr s letter to Wilkinson; and he
</p>
<p>was still further away from the truth in asserting that-
</p>
<p>the people paid no attention to the Proclamation. We
</p>
<p>have had cause to notice its effects.
</p>
<p>January i6th, while Burr was negotiating with

<p>Meade, John Randolph started on a new crusade
</p>
<p>against Jefferson by moving a Resolution asking of him
</p>
<p>what was known of the Burr Conspiracy and what
</p>
<p>measures had been taken for its suppression. This
</p>
<p>was an unusual proceeding, but it was Randolph s pur
</p>
<p>pose, now that reconciliation was neither expected, nor

<p>sought, to compromise the President, and to disgrace

<p>him in the eyes of the country. Knowing that Jefferson

<p>was opposed to a Spanish war and that the masses

</p>
<p>292 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>would hail it with acclaim, he struggled with all his
</p>
<p>indomitable energy to bring it about. Randolph con
</p>
<p>nected Burr s movements with the activity of the Span
</p>
<p>iards on the frontier, thereby making Jefferson a tar
</p>
<p>get for abuse because of his failure to use a mailed hand
</p>
<p>in his dealings with the foreigner :
</p>
<p>&quot;Ever since the peace of 1783,&quot; Randolph inveighed,
</p>
<p>&quot;Spain has incessantly labored to detach the Western peo
</p>
<p>ple from the Union. ... It appears, indeed, that she
</p>
<p>has never lost sight of this object ; and I believe she never
</p>
<p>will lose sight of it so long as she shall find materials to
</p>
<p>work upon, or a shadow of hope that she will succeed.
</p>
<p>. . . If the Government, . . . had taken a manly
</p>
<p>and decisive attitude towards Spain, and instead of pen,
</p>
<p>ink, and paper, had given men and arms is there a man
</p>
<p>who believes that not only Spain would have been over
</p>
<p>awed, but that those domestic traitors would have been
</p>
<p>intimidated and overawed, whose plans threaten to be so
</p>
<p>dangerous ?&quot;
</p>
<p>The underlying idea of the old Spanish Association
</p>
<p>here again sprang into vigorous life. In the eyes of
</p>
<p>the statesman from Virginia, Burr s enterprise was
</p>
<p>not an independent one aimed at both the Union and
</p>
<p>the Spanish provinces; it was directed solely toward
</p>
<p>the destruction of the Federation, and Spain not only
</p>
<p>applauded but was really at the bottom of the plot. The
</p>
<p>British Minister reported to Lorcl Howick that &quot;Sur
</p>
<p>mises of various kinds as to the real objects of the
</p>
<p>projects have supplied the place of facts ;&quot; but added
</p>
<p>&quot;The circumstance that has excited the greatest suspicion
</p>
<p>against the persons concerned in the enterprise, has been
</p>
<p>the very large quantity of money that has been collected.

<p>endeavor to effectuate a division of the Western country

<p>from the Union.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>Not only did the country at large believe Spain
</p>
<p>guilty of prosecuting a sinister intention to detach the
</p>
<p>Western States from the Republic, but the Government
</p>
<p>concurred in the opinion. 2 To that end Spain was sup
</p>
<p>posed to have contributed money and encouragement.
</p>
<p>One need go no further to realize how illusory and
</p>
<p>chaotic was the idea of the conspiracy in the public
</p>
<p>mind, for we know that Spain had no part whatever in
</p>
<p>the drama which made so tremendous a sensation. A
</p>
<p>majority of the House of Representatives came to the
</p>
<p>support of Randolph s Resolution, and from the tenor

<p>of the speeches made in favor of it the conclusion is only
</p>
<p>too obvious that it was believed a disclosure of the Pres

<p>ident s information would so implicate Spain that war
</p>
<p>would of necessity result.
</p>
<p>January 22d in response to the Resolution, Jefferson

<p>sent a report of the Aaron Burr affair to Congress.
</p>
<p>He related that in the latter part of September he had,

</p>
<p>from the Morgans; but in each was only mystery and
</p>
<p>indefiniteness there was in very truth nothing to be
</p>
<p>&quot;singled out for pursuit.&quot; However, Jefferson said,
</p>
<p>the receipt of Wilkinson s messages from Natchitoches
</p>
<p>utterly altered the aspect of things. These letters, to
</p>
<p>gether with other information,
</p>
<p>&quot;when brought together developed Burr s designs. .
</p>
<p>He contemplated two distinct objects, which might be
</p>
<p>carried on either jointly or separately. . . . One of
</p>
<p>these was the severance of the Union of these states by
</p>
<p>the Alleghany Mountains ; the other an attack on Mexico.
</p>
<p>A third object was provided, merely ostensible, to wit, the
</p>
<p>settlement of a pretended purchase of a tract of country
</p>
<p>on the Washita claimed by Baron Bastrop.&quot;
</p>
<p>This was but the beginning of the mischief wrought
</p>
<p>by Wilkinson s fabrications. He had &quot;developed&quot; Burr s
</p>
<p>designs and Jefferson was compelled by Congress to
</p>
<p>declare himself; so he credited his General and said
</p>
<p>that Burr s guilt was placed beyond question. Alluding
</p>
<p>to Burr, he continued, &quot;He found at once that the at
</p>
<p>tachment of the Western country to the present Union
</p>
<p>was not to be shaken,&quot; and &quot;took his course then, at
</p>
<p>once determined to seize on New Orleans, plunder the
</p>
<p>bank there, possess himself of the military and naval
</p>
<p>stores, and proceed on his expedition to Mexico.&quot;
</p>
<p>Jefferson s language was positive, but six months later
</p>
<p>it was discovered in spite of the extraordinary exer
</p>
<p>tions which had been made to procure testimony that
</p>
<p>the emphatic utterance rested upon Wilkinson, while
</p>
<p>Wilkinson in turn relied upon the President.

</p>
<p>MEASURES IN WASHINGTON 295
</p>
<p>had produced a popular impression in his favor and a
</p>
<p>general disbelief of his guilt.&quot; Herein the President
</p>
<p>did violence to the facts but no doubt unwittingly
</p>
<p>as he did when he ridiculed the transfer of the Bastrop
</p>
<p>lands as a &quot;pretended purchase.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Great alarm, indeed,&quot; declared the report, &quot;was
</p>
<p>excited at New Orleans by the exaggerated accounts
</p>
<p>of Mr. Burr, disseminated through his emissaries, of
</p>
<p>the armies and navies he^was to assemble there.&quot; Had
</p>
<p>he spoken the truth he would have had to say that gen
</p>
<p>uine alarm coincided with Wilkinson s arrival. There
</p>
<p>is nothing to show that any of the so-called emis
</p>
<p>saries of Burr were guilty of circulating inflammatory
</p>
<p>reports; but there is every reason to believe that the
</p>
<p>General deliberately strove to turn the city into a
</p>
<p>tumultuous camp. It was only another instance of his
</p>
<p>duplicity he scattered terror and gave it out that
</p>
<p>Burr s followers were doing the mischief.

<p>Jefferson s memorable communication recited in

<p>conclusion that &quot;on the whole, the fugitives from the
</p>
<p>Ohio with their associates from the Cumberland or any
</p>
<p>other place in that quarter, cannot threaten serious
</p>
<p>danger to the city of New Orleans.&quot;
</p>
<p>This assurance, however, failed to allay the sudden
</p>
<p>fears of the Senate. The ensuing day under suspension
</p>
<p>of the rules a law was passed suspending for three
</p>
<p>months the writ of habeas corpus. Monday, January

<p>26th, the bill came before the House. It was at once

<p>decided that it should be discussed with open doors
</p>
<p>and this meant its defeat. The rejection of the bill

</p>
<p>Profiting by the confusion occasioned by the report
</p>
<p>of Wilkinson s military seizures, February 7th, Mr.
</p>
<p>Broom, Federalist representative from Delaware, sub
</p>
<p>mitted the following Resolution, &quot;Resolved, that it is

<p>privilege of the writ of habeas corpus to persons in cus

</p>
<p>an animated, embittered debate was precipitated which
</p>
<p>lasted for four days. Randolph joined the Federal

<p>ists in the attack, averring that Jeffersonian Repub
</p>
<p>licanism shielded worse outrages on the Constitution
</p>
<p>than the regime which brought the Alien and Sedition

<p>that Wilkinson was justified in having trodden under

</p>
<p>Finally, driven from their ground, but confident of
</p>
<p>their voting strength, the beaten opponents of the
</p>
<p>Resolution fell back on the proposition that if by
</p>
<p>chance the accused were innocent and Wilkinson had
</p>
<p>exceeded his authority, there was the usual recourse
</p>
<p>to law for damages. This would put the writ of
</p>
<p>habeas corpus &quot;on the footing of a common tres
</p>
<p>pass,&quot; Randolph insisted, while it was &quot;the only writ
</p>
<p>sanctioned by the Constitution.&quot; It should therefore
</p>
<p>be safeguarded. As it was, if the judge violated it
</p>
<p>impeachment might be resorted to, but impeachment
</p>
<p>and Randolph spoke, having in mind his defeat in the
</p>
<p>impeachment trial of Justice Chase was an &quot;uncertain
</p>
<p>punishment&quot; ; likewise, if a military tyrant usurped the
</p>
<p>time-honored right, there was only the ordinary process
</p>
<p>for damages. Then he closed his discourse with the
</p>
<p>ringing appeal that a law should be passed against mur
</p>
<p>der though the dead man &quot;have redress without it !&quot;
</p>
<p>It was a trying moment for Jefferson. The Quids
</p>
<p>and Federalists had made sad havoc in the ranks of his
</p>
<p>supporters, and the sentiment against Wilkinson was
</p>
<p>so overwhelming that it appeared as if the President
</p>
<p>would be overborne in a misguided effort to save the
</p>
<p>chief of his army. While the debate was at its hottest
</p>
<p>the prisoners whom the General had shipped from New
</p>
<p>Orleans were on trial in the Capital, each in his turn
</p>
<p>to be liberated for want of evidence of guilt. It was

<p>that the Resolution was postponed indefinitely. The
</p>
<p>298 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>day had been saved and Wilkinson ; but the cost of it
</p>
<p>was not then to appear.
</p>
<p>On January i8th Burr had just surrendered to
</p>
<p>the civil authorities on the Bayou Pierre Jefferson
</p>
<p>learned of Wilkinson s illegal arrests, and that some
</p>
<p>of the suspected traitors would soon reach Washington.
</p>
<p>He also received for the first time a version of the
</p>
<p>famous cipher letter. In his communication to the
</p>
<p>Senate and House of January 26th he said that he had
</p>
<p>ordered all military prisoners delivered at once to the
</p>
<p>civil authorities, adding that the evidence submitted by
</p>
<p>Wilkinson was also to be laid before the courts.
</p>
<p>Alexander was the first to arrive, reaching Balti
</p>
<p>more January 3ist. He was sent straight to Washing
</p>
<p>ton, and on the sixth of February appeared before
</p>
<p>Judge Ducket, who released him for want of evidence. 1
</p>
<p>Next came Swartwout and Bollman. Upon arriving at
</p>
<p>Washington, the Supreme Court being in session, they
</p>
<p>applied for a writ of habeas corpus. February I3th
</p>
<p>Chief- Justice Marshall granted it. On a motion for
</p>
<p>their discharge the evidence was reviewed and on the
</p>
<p>twenty-eighth the Chief-Justice delivered an exhaus
</p>
<p>tive opinion, deciding that the charge of levying war
</p>
<p>had not been sustained by sufficient evidence to warrant
</p>
<p>the commitment of Swartwout, still less of Bollman.
</p>
<p>Thus three of the chief subordinates in the con
</p>
<p>spiracy, whom Wilkinson had specially consigned to
</p>
<p>the President, had escaped. It is no wonder that the
</p>
<p>General was annoyed at the result, his deposition hav

</p>
<p>Tuesday, February I7th, while the examination of
</p>
<p>Bollman and Swartwout was progressing at Washing
</p>
<p>ton, General Adair and Ogden landed in Baltimore.
</p>
<p>Wednesday the prisoners were brought before Judge

<p>Joseph N. Nicholson in obedience to a writ allowed by
</p>
<p>him that morning. They were immediately released,
</p>
<p>no cause for confinement being shown. 1
</p>
<p>&quot;Very much to my surprise and mortification,&quot; said
</p>
<p>the judge to the President, 2 &quot;there was no proof of any
</p>
<p>nature whatsoever with them, although I administered an

<p>oath to Lieutenant Luckett with a view to acquire the
</p>
<p>necessary information from him. He could give none
</p>
<p>except the common conversation of the day. And I was
</p>
<p>under the necessity of discharging the prisoners.&quot;

<p>Forty-eight hours later the Executive replied in a

<p>whether they should be punished or not belongs to an

<p>subsequent utterances, reveals a grievous weakness in

<p>his character that his great mind could harbor hatreds

<p>malignant enough to poison his love for justice. For

</p>
<p>lacking and that the matter could not be pursued. Soon
</p>
<p>after this Adair brought suit in Natchez against Wil
</p>
<p>kinson for false imprisonment. At the end of eight
</p>
<p>years the case was finally decided in an award of $2,500
</p>
<p>damages, the jury adding that the sum would have
</p>
<p>been greater but for the notorious poverty of the Gen
</p>
<p>eral. The Government, however, paid the debt. 1 Dur

<p>ing this long period Wilkinson had signally failed to

<p>make out a case against the man whom he had violently
</p>
<p>seized as a traitor the man who proved himself a hero
</p>
<p>in the battle of New Orleans, who served his State as

<p>Governor, and who ever held a high place in the esteem

<p>of the people of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.
</p>
<p>January 28th the President sent to the Senate

<p>and House the news he had received from Andrew

<p>Jackson and Captain Bissell to the effect that only a

<p>few boats had passed down the river, and that these

<p>were unwarlikc. Since none others could escape he

<p>having received a letter from Alston inquiring about
</p>
<p>the matter. February 27, 1807, the Cabinet for
</p>
<p>mally recognized by its action that the conspiracy as an
</p>
<p>active force was dead, and that the time for the prose
</p>
<p>cution of the guilty had arrived.
</p>
<p>It was &quot;agreed to discharge all the militia at stations

<p>all boats and provisions seized, except Blennerhassett s,

<p>steps to strengthen his position with the President.

</p>
<p>&quot;You must long before this perusal have heard of the
</p>
<p>salutary decision to which I have been driven in this city,
</p>
<p>and of the persecution and abuse I have suffered and am
</p>
<p>suffering in consequence of it. The late clemency and
</p>
<p>confidence extended to Colonel Burr in the Mississippi
</p>
<p>Territory, the popular standing he has acquired there, and
</p>
<p>his mock trial and acquittal, and his recent flight from
</p>
<p>justice, may, I hope, have the tendency to dissipate the
</p>
<p>delusions spread abroad by his open adherents and nu
</p>
<p>merous secret friends in this quarter ; and at the same
</p>
<p>time serve to illustrate the soundness of those strong-
</p>
<p>handed precautions to which I resorted to destroy the con
</p>
<p>cert and cooperation of the conspirators, to stem the tor
</p>
<p>rent of disaffection, and to save this city from the horrors
</p>
<p>of a civil commotion.&quot;
</p>
<p>A more forceful statement of his case could not

<p>have been written the collapse of the conspiracy left
</p>
<p>him fearful of the consequences. He grasped at every
</p>
<p>incident which would help his cause or palliate his
</p>
<p>illegal acts. Prosecution and disgrace seemed to him
</p>
<p>fast approaching the consciousness of his own
</p>
<p>guilt raised before him nameless terrors which he
</p>
<p>sought to silence by repeating the magical name of
</p>
<p>Jefferson. His method with the President was irre
</p>
<p>sistible. All his fine argument was to lead up to an
</p>
<p>appeal which Jefferson, through his alliance, was com
</p>
<p>pelled to hear and to heed. &quot;But, sir,&quot; said Wilkin

<p>son, &quot;when the tempest has passed away and dangers

<p>to buffet a combination of bar and bench.&quot; In con
</p>
<p>clusion the General hastened to felicitate the President
</p>
<p>on his narrow escape from a terrible calamity and upon
</p>
<p>the discovery in the West of a degree of loyalty beyond
</p>
<p>imagination.
</p>
<p>&quot;I congratulate you, sir, with my whole soul on the

<p>issue which the nefarious project has taken. ... I
</p>
<p>consider the general safety secured, and I view with ex
</p>
<p>ultation the triumph of principle in the patriotic display
</p>
<p>made by the states of the Ohio.&quot;
</p>
<p>For Wilkinson to prate of the &quot;patriotic display
</p>
<p>made by the states of the Ohio,&quot; a region he had repre
</p>
<p>sented as ripe for revolt, was downright knavery recoil
</p>
<p>ing on itself. Moreover, when he confessed that the
</p>
<p>native population of Louisiana, the Creoles, were the
</p>
<p>most loyal of Americans, his hypocrisy was laid bare
</p>
<p>in all its hideousness he admitted that the West
</p>
<p>from the Ohio to the Gulf of Mexico was stanchly
</p>
<p>patriotic, and that he had made his accusations for sel
</p>
<p>fish purposes. Even at such a moment his courage, al

<p>us here in doubts and fears as to the speedy termination

<p>iaries, it is probable he will make some desperate attempt
</p>
<p>against the Spaniards either in West Florida or by Na-
</p>
<p>cogdoches; for, unless he can gild his crimes by some
</p>
<p>extraordinary stroke of fortune, he must seek the grave
</p>
<p>as his only resort. We have many here who would wish
</p>
<p>to see him master of the city, but his followers will not
</p>
<p>support him (generally) in any attempt directly against
</p>
<p>the United States, and besides my little force has become
</p>
<p>too respectable to be approached by any body of irregulars
</p>
<p>without imminent danger/
</p>
<p>The manifest uneasiness that Burr would yet &quot;gild
</p>
<p>his crimes * by attacking some part of the Spanish do
</p>
<p>minions vividly recalls Wilkinson s dispatch to the
</p>
<p>President from Natchitoches in which he indicated that
</p>
<p>with the proper authority he might direct the energies
</p>
<p>of the associates against the enemy. The fear was now
</p>
<p>that they would of their own accord assail some Spanish
</p>
<p>settlement and for the purpose simply, as he chose to
</p>
<p>express it, of saving themselves from traitors graves.
</p>
<p>Were the Mississippians in reality playing a sinister
</p>
<p>part in the drama of disaffection when they volunteered
</p>
<p>against Burr, and when they later declared they had
</p>
<p>been deceived in believing his enterprise hostile to the
</p>
<p>nation of which they were a part ? It was a late hour,
</p>
<p>but a fitting climax for Wilkinson to admit that Burr s
</p>
<p>forces would make no &quot;attempt directly against the
</p>
<p>United States.&quot; The General s case was still hanging
</p>
<p>in the balance. The capture of Baton Rouge by the
</p>
<p>Burrites would have irretrievably overthrown it.

</p>
<p>MEASURES IN WASHINGTON 305
</p>
<p>upon secret combinations. Wilkinson reenforced Gra
</p>
<p>ham s observation as to the predominant purpose in the
</p>
<p>masses to invade the Spanish territories, and while
</p>
<p>busy searching for witnesses and clearing away the
</p>
<p>debris of the conspiracy, he discussed briefly the situa
</p>
<p>tion of affairs with Jefferson. 1 Noting Bonaparte s
</p>
<p>plan for universal dominion, he passed to a subject he
</p>
<p>said he had had some time in mind. With leave he
</p>
<p>could foster a revolution in Mexico. Referring to a
</p>
<p>conversation he had with the President in 1804 con
</p>
<p>cerning Cuba, he advised the capture of the island;
</p>
<p>adding that within six months in conjunction with an
</p>
<p>English squadron the Floridas might be taken and
</p>
<p>Mexico freed.
</p>
<p>&quot;They [the Floridas] are ripe for violent measures.
</p>
<p>. . . If the United States will not protect them they
</p>
<p>will solicit the help of England. The taking of Baton
</p>
<p>Rouge and Pensacola they speak of as matters of trifling
</p>
<p>achievement. They have about four hundred men who
</p>
<p>will follow their standard to any length they please.&quot;
</p>
<p>These expositions to the Executive are supple
</p>
<p>mented by a letter to Clark, which is characteristic and
</p>
<p>shows that the General was eager for the revolution

<p>izing of Mexico, provided he was the leader of the

<p>army.
</p>
<p>&quot;The chiefs of Mexico are ready to declare for inde

<p>its usual guard.&quot;
</p>
<p>Was it only now dawning on the General that the
</p>
<p>Mexicans were ready to declare for independence?
</p>
<p>The news was nothing new. By coincidence, at the
</p>
<p>time Wilkinson wrote, one of Burr s agents, ignorant
</p>
<p>that the end had come at Bayou Pierre, continued his
</p>
<p>operations in San Antonio de Bexar with so much bold
</p>
<p>ness that the Government was soon in pursuit of him.
</p>
<p>Cordero said to Salcedo that one of Burr s associates
</p>
<p>full of &quot;cabalistic&quot; ideas was there engaged in foment
</p>
<p>ing rebellion. 1 Could there have been any connection
</p>
<p>between Wilkinson s idea of &quot;fomenting&quot; a revolution
</p>
<p>in Mexico and the original design of the conspirators ?
</p>
<p>Who will say there is no relation between the expedi

</p>
<p>The sentiment prevailing in New Orleans rang out

<p>clearly at a banquet in May, 1807. Jefferson, the author

<p>of the Declaration of Independence, was toasted for
</p>
<p>having sustained Wilkinson in his military arrests, his

<p>that one of the crimes of a tyrant is that &quot;He has af

<p>Sharp and unrelenting as was the criticism urged
</p>
<p>against the Governor, he had profited in no wise from
</p>
<p>his experience of the past months. He was still as
</p>
<p>unstable, as pliant, and as incapable of grasping a situa
</p>
<p>tion as when he first came into the government of the
</p>
<p>Territory. To show what absurdities he could enter
</p>
<p>tain, what unfounded situations he could conjure up,
</p>
<p>one has but to follow his correspondence.
</p>
<p>&quot;I anticipate very considerable opposition,&quot; he said
</p>
<p>to the President, 2 &quot;in the administration of this govern
</p>
<p>ment ; the intrigue of the associates of Burr will be con
</p>
<p>tinued, and will principally be leveled against me. Gen
</p>
<p>eral Wilkinson having gone, I am perhaps the only officer
</p>
<p>of the general government, now here, who supports the
</p>
<p>late proceedings in this territory; proceedings which
</p>
<p>were influenced by the purest motives, and of the pro
</p>
<p>priety of which, taking them in the aggregate, I have
</p>
<p>now no doubt.&quot;
</p>
<p>He also launched his suspicions at Colonel Freeman
</p>
<p>of the army, and at Brown, collector of the port. He
</p>
<p>condemned Dr. Watkins, saying that &quot;the intriguing
</p>
<p>of designing men had caused him to abandon those
</p>
<p>principles which he once professed and practiced.&quot; A
</p>
<p>few weeks earlier he had said to Madison :
</p>
<p>&quot;With respect to Dr. Watkins, it is due to justice to
</p>
<p>add, that I believe he meditated nothing against the
</p>
<p>American Government and that he sincerely loves his

<p>country. I, however, am of opinion that his zeal for the

<p>dences, and under this impression, although my private
</p>
<p>regard for him is considerable, I have withdrawn my

<p>official patronage.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>Watkins was indeed compelled to resign the mayor
</p>
<p>alty of New Orleans. But Claiborne certainly did not
</p>
<p>consider in what light he placed himself when he ad
</p>
<p>mitted that he was the only official now in the city who
</p>
<p>supported the &quot;late proceedings&quot; in that region. He
</p>
<p>was unable to break the spell which had been cast over
</p>
<p>J him. Believing the General honest, he thought who
</p>
<p>ever antagonized his measures a schemer, a Burrite.
</p>
<p>Such a victim was Watkins. And Claiborne s views
</p>
<p>remained unregenerate to the last, although he came to
</p>
<p>confess what Jefferson was loath to believe and what
</p>
<p>has been denied by historians for a century that the
</p>
<p>Creoles were loyal to the Union !
</p>
<p>&quot;General Adair is still here,&quot; he related to Jefferson,
</p>
<p>&quot;and daily in the receipt of the most pointed attentions
</p>
<p>from a portion of our American society. He abuses our
</p>
<p>government and its officers, and denounces Wilkinson as
</p>
<p>a pensioner of Spain and a traitor to his country. If Burr
</p>
<p>should be acquitted, it is probable we shall see him here
</p>
<p>also in the fall. But I do not think it will be in his power
</p>
<p>to induce the Louisianians to favor his views or plans. It
</p>
<p>is a fact, sir, that the Louisianians, I mean the ancient in
</p>
<p>habitants of the country, are now the best supporters of
</p>
<p>the American government.&quot; 2
</p>
<p>The Governor followed complacently the lead of
</p>
<p>his military superior, who had recently informed the
</p>
<p>President that Adair was &quot;capable of a desperate enter

<p>plot and convinces me it is not abandoned.&quot; * But
</p>
<p>Jefferson was too much engrossed with imperative na
</p>
<p>tional affairs to ask for evidence. He was indeed
</p>
<p>obliged to credit the reports of his officials, and if he
</p>
<p>was deceived he might plead in extenuation the exag
</p>
<p>gerations of distance and the distemper of society at
</p>
<p>large. Nevertheless, with the President s bias and
</p>
<p>preconceived notions of Burr it was all too easy for him
</p>
<p>to believe in his guilt and no surprise that the hue
</p>
<p>of that guilt should be as dark as Wilkinson could
</p>
<p>paint it. By this time, indeed, Jefferson was proof
</p>
<p>against alarms they were out of season to say the
</p>
<p>least, now that Burr and his coterie of associates were
</p>
<p>in the toils of the law. There was, however, little
</p>
<p>cause for jubilation at Washington. The acquittal of
</p>
<p>Bollman, Swartwout, and the other minor characters
</p>
<p>aroused in the Government a determination to secure at
</p>
<p>any cost the conviction of Burr the credit of the
</p>
<p>Administration was at stake; and in the prosecution of
</p>
<p>the case neither time nor money was to be spared.
</p>
<p>Following the resolution of the Cabinet at the end of

<p>February, Rodney soon had printed lists of questions
</p>
<p>with an appeal to honest citizens to send by affidavit
</p>
<p>their knowledge of the affair scattered throughout the

<p>CHAPTER XII.
</p>
<p>The Trial at Richmond.
</p>
<p>MARCH 5, 1807, surrounded by a guard of
</p>
<p>six men under Nicholas Perkins, who had
</p>
<p>been instrumental in his interception, Burr
</p>
<p>set out from Fort Stoddert on the journey of a thou
</p>
<p>sand miles to Washington. Twenty-one days later the
</p>
<p>prisoner was lodged in the Eagle Tavern, Richmond,
</p>
<p>whither he had been directed by order of the Executive.
</p>
<p>The day following he wrote his daughter : &quot;It seems
</p>
<p>that here the business is to be tried and concluded. I
</p>
<p>am to be surrendered to the civil authority to-morrow,
</p>
<p>when the question of bail is to be determined. In the
</p>
<p>meantime I remain at the Eagle Tavern.&quot;
</p>
<p>March 3Oth, in a small room of the Tavern, Burr
</p>
<p>came up for an examination before Chief-Justice
</p>
<p>Marshall, in whose district the alleged crime, or crimes,
</p>
<p>had been committed. George Hay, district-attorney
</p>
<p>for the United States, moved for a commitment on
</p>
<p>charges of misdemeanor and treason. Two days of
</p>
<p>argument followed ; then the Chief- Justice delivered
</p>
<p>his opinion :
</p>
<p>&quot;The fact to be proved in this case is an act of public
</p>
<p>notoriety. It must exist in the view of the world, or it
</p>
<p>cannot exist at all. The assembling of forces to levy war
</p>
<p>is a visible transaction, and numbers must witness it. It
</p>
<p>is, therefore, capable of proof; and when time to collect
</p>
<p>this proof has been given, it ought to be adduced, or sus
</p>
<p>picion becomes ground too weak to stand upon. . . .

</p>
<p>THE TRIAL AT RICHMOND 311
</p>
<p>If in November or December last, a body of troops had
</p>
<p>been assembled on the Ohio, it is impossible to suppose
</p>
<p>that affidavits establishing the fact could not have been
</p>
<p>obtained by the last of March. . . . On the evidence
</p>
<p>furnished by this very transaction of the attachment felt
</p>
<p>by our Western for their Eastern brethren, we justly
</p>
<p>felicitate ourselves. How inconsistent with this fact is
</p>
<p>the idea, that no man could be found who would volun
</p>
<p>tarily depose, that a body of troops had actually assem
</p>
<p>bled, whose object was detested and defeated by the very
</p>
<p>people who could give the requisite information ! I can
</p>
<p>not doubt that means to obtain information have been
</p>
<p>taken on the part of the prosecution ; if it existed, I can
</p>
<p>not doubt the practicability of obtaining it ; and its non-
</p>
<p>production, at this late hour, does not, in my opinion,
</p>
<p>leave me at liberty to give to those suspicions which grow
</p>
<p>out of other circumstances, the weight to which at an
</p>
<p>earlier day they might have been entitled. I shall not,
</p>
<p>therefore, insert in the commitment the charge of high
</p>
<p>treason.&quot;
</p>
<p>Accordingly, the accused was bound in the sum of
</p>
<p>$10,000 to appear at the next term of the Circuit Court
</p>
<p>to convene at Richmond, May 22d, to answer the
</p>
<p>charge of high misdemeanor. Five securities presented
</p>
<p>themselves, and on the afternoon of April ist Burr was
</p>
<p>once more at liberty.
</p>
<p>Jefferson was enraged at this first defeat ; the prose
</p>
<p>cution was nonplussed; and ever since there have
</p>
<p>risen eminent authorities to proclaim that throughout
</p>
<p>the course of the trial Marshall s political bias and
</p>
<p>personal dislike of Jefferson warped his judgment in
</p>
<p>favor of Burr to the shame of the law and the evidence.
</p>
<p>In that they are but consistent. Treating the con

</p>
<p>must offer some explanation for the collapse of the pros-

</p>
<p>ecution ; and it is much easier to show that Burr escaped
</p>
<p>.through the connivance of the judge, or by the aid of
</p>
<p>the Federalists, who &quot;affected to disbelieve in the con
</p>
<p>spiracy,&quot; or through the apathy of the Republicans, who
</p>
<p>&quot;had never been able to persuade themselves that the
</p>
<p>Union was really in danger,&quot; than it is to admit the
</p>
<p>failure of the evidence. The logic of Marshall s posi
</p>
<p>tion was irresistible. If it was censorious and over-
</p>
<p>severe, the fundamental argument presented was not
</p>
<p>then, and has not been to this day, successfully refuted.
</p>
<p>The prosecution read out of it a deliberate expression
</p>
<p>of doubt as to Burr s guilt, while Jefferson whether
</p>
<p>from a sense of culpability (he had not ordered a full
</p>
<p>investigation of the plot till the Cabinet meeting of
</p>
<p>February 27th), or of resentment at Marshall s seem
</p>
<p>ing want of respect for a coordinate branch of the
</p>
<p>Government replied with redoubled energy. He said
</p>
<p>plainly to Senator Giles, who had been foremost in
</p>
<p>the assault on the last stronghold of Federalism the
</p>
<p>Judiciary that the fight against this entrenched
</p>
<p>tyranny would not be relinquished and intimated that,
</p>
<p>if Burr escaped, Marshall should himself make answer
</p>
<p>to the nation.
</p>
<p>&quot;In what terms of decency can we speak of this ? [He
</p>
<p>had already referred to Marshall s &quot;tricks to force trials
</p>
<p>before it is possible to collect the evidence.&quot;] 1 As if an
</p>
<p>express could go to Natchez or the mouth of the Cumber
</p>
<p>land and return in five weeks, to do which has never taken
</p>
<p>less than twelve! . . . But all the principles of law
</p>
<p>are to be perverted which would bear on the favorite of
</p>
<p>fenders who endeavor to overturn this odious republic!

</p>
<p>. . . The nation will judge both the offender and the
</p>
<p>judges for themselves. If a member of the Executive or
</p>
<p>Legislature does wrong, the day is never far distant when
</p>
<p>the people will remove him. They will see then and
</p>
<p>amend the error in our Constitution which makes any
</p>
<p>branch independent of the nation. ... If their pro
</p>
<p>tection of Burr produces this amendment, it will do more
</p>
<p>good than his condemnation would have done; . .
</p>
<p>and if his punishment can be commuted now for a useful
</p>
<p>amendment of the Constitution, I shall rejoice in it.&quot;
</p>
<p>The ultimate consequences might be this or that,
</p>
<p>but the first consideration to Jefferson was to secure the
</p>
<p>conviction of Burr. To that end both he and his
</p>
<p>subordinates toiled. Rodney, operating from Wash
</p>
<p>ington, sent printed circulars to hamlet and country
</p>
<p>side, inciting &quot;every good citizen to step forward, and
</p>
<p>communicate to the government any information he
</p>
<p>may possess which may contribute to the general wel
</p>
<p>fare.&quot; A deputy marshal and special messenger were
</p>
<p>dispatched to Wood County to take depositions and to
</p>
<p>summon all the witnesses at and near Blennerhassett s
</p>
<p>island ; while both Madison and Rodney wrote Andrew
</p>
<p>Jackson in April, hoping to have depositions sent on
</p>
<p>from that quarter which would enable them to commit
</p>
<p>Burr for treason. 1
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Wilkinson, in New Orleans busy as
</p>
<p>late as April suppressing the still surviving conspiracy,
</p>
<p>witness his letter to Jefferson found time to send a
</p>
<p>number of agents into Mississippi and elsewhere to col

<p>able to bring undoubted proof of Burr s guilt. March
</p>
<p>27th he said that he expected to prove that Burr had
</p>
<p>sunk his own ordnance boat the commander of which
</p>
<p>he hoped to capture in the river at Bayou Pierre, and
</p>
<p>that Burr had seduced Sergeant Dunbaugh (whom he
</p>
<p>should soon have in his hands) to desert the service.
</p>
<p>Besides these Wilkinson hoped to secure one Motley
</p>
<p>who had ridden with Burr during September and Octo
</p>
<p>ber, and who knew his correspondence and designs. 1
</p>
<p>Again, April 3d, the General wrote on the subject of his
</p>
<p>search for witnesses: &quot;I shall persevere until I have
</p>
<p>obtained some more important testimony from two or
</p>
<p>three of Burr s confidentials.&quot; 2 This sounds very unlike
</p>
<p>the man Mr. Adams assures us meant &quot;to close his eyes
</p>
<p>against evidence that could compromise any citizen&quot; of
</p>
<p>New Orleans. 3
</p>
<p>The excitement occasioned by the appearance of the
</p>
<p>expedition on the Mississippi had scarcely begun to
</p>
<p>subside when Jefferson s hatred and jealousy of the op
</p>
<p>posing political party became still more extreme. This
</p>
<p>was in part due to the fact that he identified the Federal
</p>
<p>ists with Burr s friends ; and he not only believed them
</p>
<p>to be Burr s sympathizers, but his active partisans as
</p>
<p>well. He had forgotten that the first attack on Burr,
</p>
<p>disorderly and unjustified though it was, had been made
</p>
<p>by the leaders of that faith in Kentucky. &quot;The Federal
</p>
<p>ists have so decidedly made common cause with Burr,&quot;

<p>or a Burrite to the Orleans Territory I consider it the
</p>
<p>same thing.&quot; Writing a few days afterwards to
</p>
<p>George Morgan, of Morganza, the President gave ex
</p>
<p>pression to his distrust of Marshall and his party : x
</p>
<p>&quot;Burr is on his way to Richmond for trial, and if the
</p>
<p>judges do not discharge him before it is possible to collect
</p>
<p>the testimony from Maine to New Orleans, there can be
</p>
<p>no doubt where his history will end. To what degree
</p>
<p>punishment of his adherents shall be extended, will be
</p>
<p>decided when we shall have collected all the evidence, and
</p>
<p>seen who were cordially guilty. The Federalists appear
</p>
<p>to make Burr s cause their own, and spare no efforts to
</p>
<p>screen his adherents. Their great mortification is at the
</p>
<p>failure of his plans.&quot;
</p>
<p>The gleam of satisfaction in the phrase that &quot;there
</p>
<p>can be no doubt where his history will end&quot; was sud
</p>
<p>denly overclouded by the shadow of Federalism. There
</p>
<p>can be no denying the fact that Jefferson thought the
</p>
<p>Federalists capable of shielding traitors; that he be
</p>
<p>lieved, incorruptible as the great body of the party
</p>
<p>might be, disloyalty and disunion were their actuating
</p>
<p>principles. We know this opinion to have been extreme,
</p>
<p>but there was indeed a numerically small but powerful
</p>
<p>contingent which would have applauded the consum
</p>
<p>mation of such a programme as Burr s was declared to
</p>
<p>be. There was probably, too, in Jefferson s madness a
</p>
<p>purpose no less a one than to bring the party of the
</p>
<p>opposition into final disruption by tainting it with
</p>
<p>treason. Such inoculation must have proven fatal.

<p>the political principles he professed; and that could

<p>never be until the defiant opposition was trampled under
</p>
<p>in the pell-mell of universal Democratic triumph.
</p>
<p>Jefferson has left us some curious records concern
</p>
<p>ing his opinion of the conspiracy. In a letter to James
</p>
<p>Bowdoin, then minister to Spain, after discussing our
</p>
<p>relations with that power, he admitted what Randolph
</p>
<p>was avowing in the House that the hand of the Don
</p>
<p>was hidden in the Western intrigue r 1
</p>
<p>&quot;Never did a nation act towards another with more
</p>
<p>perfidy and injustice than Spain has constantly practiced
</p>
<p>against us ; and if we have kept our hands off her till now,
</p>
<p>it has been purely out of respect to France, and from the
</p>
<p>value we set on the friendship of France. We expect,
</p>
<p>therefore, from the friendship of the Emperor that he will
</p>
<p>either compel Spain to do us justice, or abandon her to
</p>
<p>us. We ask but one month to be in possession of the City
</p>
<p>of Mexico. No better proof of the good faith of the

<p>United States could have been given than the vigor with

<p>which we have acted and the expense incurred in suppress

<p>western country, and on that ground received encourage

<p>his government towards us, yet he very early saw that

<p>the fidelity of the western country was not to be shaken

<p>and turned himself wholly toward Mexico, and so popular
</p>
<p>is an enterprise on that country in this, that we had only

<p>to lie still and he would have had followers enough to

<p>have been in the City of Mexico in six weeks.&quot;

</p>
<p>would have had a more difficult task in reconciling his
</p>
<p>own opinion of Burr s talents as an intriguer and the
</p>
<p>unpardonable blunder of failing to discover, till the
</p>
<p>eleventh hour, that the frontiersmen were ardent pa
</p>
<p>triots. &quot;To lie still&quot; and leave Mexico to the mercies
</p>
<p>of the filibusters of the West would have been as easy
</p>
<p>as closing his eyes when the Leander, commanded by
</p>
<p>Miranda and manned by revolutionists, sailed from the;
</p>
<p>port of New York. Had the President planned to lie!
</p>
<p>still ? It seems in truth most probable. It was the cry!
</p>
<p>of treason that roused him. Jefferson never main--
</p>
<p>tained for any great length of time the same view of
</p>
<p>the so-called conspiracy. A few weeks after the above
</p>
<p>dispatch he wrote another equally remarkable.
</p>
<p>&quot;Burr s conspiracy,&quot; he wrote Dupont de Nemours, 1
</p>
<p>&quot;has been one of the most flagitious of which history will
</p>
<p>ever furnish an example. He has combined the objects of
</p>
<p>separating the western states from us, of adding Mexico
</p>
<p>to them, and of placing himself at their head. But he who
</p>
<p>could expect to effect such objects by the aid of American
</p>
<p>citizens, must be perfectly ripe for bedlam. . . . He
</p>
<p>had probably induced near a thousand men to engage with
</p>
<p>him by making them believe the government connived
</p>
<p>at it. ... A proclamation alone, by undeceiving
</p>
<p>them, so completely disarmed him that he had not above
</p>
<p>thirty men left, ready to go all lengths with him. The
</p>
<p>first enterprise was to have been the seizure of New
</p>
<p>Orleans, which he supposed would powerfully bridle the
</p>
<p>country above, and place him at the door of Mexico. It
</p>
<p>has given me infinite satisfaction that not a single native
</p>
<p>Creole of Louisiana, and but one American settled there
</p>
<p>before the delivery of the country to us, were in his inter

<p>est. His partisans there were made up of fugitives from

<p>That a clever impostor might enlist a thousand
</p>
<p>Westerners to aid in the establishment of an empire
</p>
<p>stretching from the Alleghanies to the Sierra Madre
</p>
<p>Mountains by informing them that the Government
</p>
<p>connived at the scheme seemed to Jefferson a feat easy
</p>
<p>of accomplishment, so shorn were they of all affiliations
</p>
<p>social and political. But the Proclamation changed
</p>
<p>everything as at the stroke of a magic wand. There is
</p>
<p>grievous blundering somewhere. Either Burr engaged
</p>
<p>his followers with the specific object of invading
</p>
<p>Mexico, which the Government would not oppose, or
</p>
<p>else he was indeed a fit subject for bedlam along with
</p>
<p>the thousand irresponsibles reclaimed by the Proclama

<p>tion. The statement that none of the Creoles were in
</p>
<p>Burr s interest places him strangely at variance with
</p>
<p>most of those who have written of the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>That Wilkinson and Claiborne should also have come
</p>
<p>in the spring of 1807 to believe the Creoles the most

<p>from Morganza, whom the President credited with
</p>
<p>having given the first notice of the plot, and to whom
</p>
<p>he had said, &quot;You have deserved well of your country.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>Thither came Colonel De Pestre, friend and ally of
</p>
<p>Burr, whose honor the Government attempted to buy;
</p>
<p>Bollman, distinguished for his services to La Fayette;

<p>who had been ready to repudiate his father-in-law when

<p>he was first accused of treason ; and Giles, leader of the

<p>Republicans in the Senate; and John Randolph of

<p>Roanoke, the brilliant, eccentric leader of the Quids in

<p>320 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>At half-past twelve o clock, May 22, 1807, the court
</p>
<p>convened, with Chief-Justice Marshall and Cyrus
</p>
<p>Griffin on the bench. Perhaps the country has never
</p>
<p>seen another such array of learning and legal talent
</p>
<p>as that which gathered within the Virginia House of
</p>
<p>Burgesses. First of all was John Marshall, calm,
</p>
<p>deliberate, and fearless. &quot;The Chief-Justice, in his
</p>
<p>fifty-second year (one year older than the prisoner),&quot;
</p>
<p>to use the language of Parton, &quot;was a tall, slender man,
</p>
<p>with a majestic head, without one gray hair, with eyes
</p>
<p>the finest ever seen, except Burr s, large, black, and
</p>
<p>brilliant beyond description. It was often remarked
</p>
<p>during the trial, that two such pairs of eyes had never
</p>
<p>looked into one another before.&quot;
</p>
<p>The accused was surrounded by the foremost law
</p>
<p>yers of the time: Edmund Randolph, delegate to the
</p>
<p>Philadelphia Constitutional Convention, and Attorney-
</p>
<p>General and Secretary of State in the Cabinet of Presi
</p>
<p>dent Washington; John Wickham, who was regarded
</p>
<p>as the ablest lawyer at the Richmond bar, possessing
</p>
<p>&quot;wit, sarcasm, eloquence, a fine presence and a persuas
</p>
<p>ive manner&quot;; Benjamin Botts, also of Virginia, keen
</p>
<p>witted, aggressive, and hardly inferior in ability to his
</p>
<p>associates; &quot;Jack&quot; Baker, who seems to have been en
</p>
<p>gaged on account of his knowledge of Virginia jury
</p>
<p>men ; Charles Lee, sometime Attorney-General for
</p>
<p>Maryland a man of fine mental gifts: and Luther
</p>
<p>Martin, the &quot;Thersites of the law,&quot; who, in legal learn
</p>
<p>ing, towered head and shoulders above those around
</p>
<p>him, the first lawyer of his time. Jefferson called him

</p>
<p>&quot;Federal bulldog,&quot; and Martin, in his bitterness and
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL AT RICHMOND 321
</p>
<p>enthusiasm, proclaimed the President ruthless and
</p>
<p>tyrannical in having loosed the &quot;hell-hounds of persecu
</p>
<p>tion&quot; against Burr. Once before, in the impeachment
</p>
<p>proceedings against Justice Chase, Martin had met the
</p>
<p>President in open field, and he was resolved that this
</p>
<p>time the victory should be no less complete.
</p>
<p>On the side of the prosecution there appeared no
</p>
<p>such strength. Caesar A. Rodney, who succeeded to
</p>
<p>the-post of Attorney-General a month after the death
</p>
<p>of John Breckenridge of Kentucky, was a lawyer of
</p>
<p>ordinary talents. Realizing the hopelessness of the
</p>
<p>situation, or fearing to measure strength with the
</p>
<p>opposition, he left Richmond after the preliminaries
</p>
<p>and never returned. The brunt of the battle fell upon
</p>
<p>the district-attorney, George Hay, son-in-law to James
</p>
<p>Monroe, who was both willing and competent, and w,ho
</p>
<p>was aided by frequent suggestions from Jefferson in
</p>
<p>the conduct of the case. The President, too, in order
</p>
<p>to strengthen the prosecution, resorted to the expedient
</p>
<p>of bringing other attorneys into the case at the Gov
</p>
<p>ernment s expense. William Wirt, whose name is asso
</p>
<p>ciated with America s foremost orators, was invited to
</p>
<p>assist. The third counsel for the prosecution was Alex
</p>
<p>ander McRae, Lieutenant-Governor of Virginia, who
</p>
<p>was less adroit, less able than his colleagues. Such
</p>
<p>being the list of counsel engaged, it was at once appa
</p>
<p>rent that the defense, not to rate the force of Burr who
</p>
<p>in a large measure directed his own case, far outclassed
</p>
<p>the representatives of the Government, both in point of
</p>
<p>legal learning and strategic skill.

</p>
<p>The depth of public feeling and general belief in
</p>
<p>322 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>Burr s guilt disclosed itself in the first proceedings of
</p>
<p>the trial the selection of a grand jury. There was
</p>
<p>scarcely one of the panel who had not made up his mind.
</p>
<p>The President s Proclamation, with the depositions of
</p>
<p>Eaton and Wilkinson, had caused them to prejudge the
</p>
<p>case most of them readily confessing it and it was
</p>
<p>noticeable that a majority of the jurors summoned by
</p>
<p>the marshal were strong supporters of the Adminis
</p>
<p>tration so noticeable indeed that it could not have
</p>
<p>happened by chance. At last, however, the jury was
</p>
<p>sworn and John Randolph appointed foreman. But no
</p>
<p>indictment could be returned until General Wilkinson
</p>
<p>had arrived from New Orleans. Thus the public in
</p>
<p>quisitors were compelled to adjourn from day to day
</p>
<p>and from week to week awaiting the arrival of the
</p>
<p>hero from the South, who seemed to care little when
</p>
<p>the trial began, or what inconveniences his tardiness
</p>
<p>occasioned, so long as he could bring with him the wit
</p>
<p>nesses he had promised Jefferson. Twenty-four days
</p>
<p>after the opening of the court he finally made his ap
</p>
<p>pearance.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Marshall had not been idle. Hay had
</p>
<p>moved the commitment of Burr on the charge of
</p>
<p>treason, alleging that the approach of Wilkinson might
</p>
<p>put him to flight. &quot;On his examination,&quot; said the
</p>
<p>prosecutor, &quot;there was no evidence of an overt act, and
</p>
<p>he was committed for a misdemeanor only. The evi
</p>
<p>dence is different now.&quot; The defense immediately
</p>
<p>grappled with the problem, which was clearly to restrict
</p>
<p>the latitude of the Government s action, to prevent a

</p>
<p>premature disclosure of the testimony. To commit
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL AT RICHMOND 323
</p>
<p>Burr for treason would involve the examination of
</p>
<p>witnesses viva voce, and the order of the examination
</p>
<p>precipitated the question which became the chief con
</p>
<p>tention of the counsel: What testimony was admis
</p>
<p>sible? It was in this connection that the definition of
</p>
<p>the crime of high treason under the Constitution was
</p>
<p>elaborated the definition which is still held by the
</p>
<p>courts.
</p>
<p>&quot;In England,&quot; declared Botts, &quot;where conspiring the
</p>
<p>death of the King was treason, the quo animo formed
</p>
<p>the essence of the offense ; but in America the national
</p>
<p>convention has confined treason to the act. We cannot
</p>
<p>have a constructive war within the meaning of the Con
</p>
<p>stitution. An intention to levy war is not evidence that
</p>
<p>war was levied.&quot;
</p>
<p>The contention of the defense was that to establish
</p>
<p>the crime of high treason it must first be proved that a
</p>
<p>war consisting of acts had transpired; secondly, that
</p>
<p>an overt act of treason had been committed in the war ;
</p>
<p>thirdly, that the accused committed an overt (not a
</p>
<p>covert) act in the war to which two witnesses must
</p>
<p>testify and within the district in which the trial is
</p>
<p>ordered. Marshall declared this interpretation to be
</p>
<p>correct; and the whole scheme of the prosecution was
</p>
<p>undone. Hay and Jefferson were both perplexed and
</p>
<p>enraged and made but a feeble attempt to prove that
</p>
<p>an act of war which was only the first of several steps
</p>
<p>had been committed on Blennerhassett s island the
</p>
<p>night of December 10, 1806. Hay realized the futility
</p>
<p>of his efforts to commit on the charge of treason, and

<p>was only too glad to escape further mortification in
</p>
<p>3 2 4 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>ending the matter by Burr s voluntary doubling of his
</p>
<p>bond.
</p>
<p>A counter-move had been made meanwhile by the
</p>
<p>defendant. This was a motion for a subpoena duces
</p>
<p>tecum to be directed to the President who had in his
</p>
<p>possession, it was alleged, certain letters from Wilkin
</p>
<p>son which were deemed material to the defense. Burr
</p>
<p>had, on a visit to Washington, made a personal request
</p>
<p>for copies of the General s letter of October 21, 1806,
</p>
<p>and of the orders which had been issued to the army and
</p>
<p>navy concerning himself and had been refused. Would
</p>
<p>a subpoena duces tecum produce a better result? Had it
</p>
<p>been a part of the programme of the defense to throw
</p>
<p>odium on the Executive no more ingenious method
</p>
<p>could have been devised. Abundant opportunity was
</p>
<p>offered for declamation against the despotism of the
</p>
<p>Government and against the persecution to which Burr
</p>
<p>had been subjected.
</p>
<p>&quot;All that we want is the copies of some papers,&quot; burst
</p>
<p>out Luther Martin, &quot;and the original of another. This is
</p>
<p>a peculiar case, sir. The President has undertaken to
</p>
<p>prejudge my client by declaring that of his guilt there
</p>
<p>can be no doubt/ He has assumed the knowledge of the
</p>
<p>Supreme Being himself, and pretended to search the
</p>
<p>heart of my highly respected friend. He has proclaimed
</p>
<p>him a traitor in the face of that country which has re
</p>
<p>warded him. He has let slip the dogs of war, the hell
</p>
<p>hounds of persecution, to hunt down my friend. And
</p>
<p>would this President of the United States, who has raised
</p>
<p>all this absurd clamor, pretend to keep back the papers
</p>
<p>which are wanted for this trial, where life itself is at
</p>
<p>stake ? It is a sacred principle, that in all such cases, the

<p>accused has the right to all the evidence which is neces

</p>
<p>sary for his defense.&quot;
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL AT RICHMOND 325
</p>
<p>If this arraignment was unnecessarily severe, the
</p>
<p>justice of the central theme could scarcely be ques
</p>
<p>tioned. Nor did the gentlemen of the prosecution
</p>
<p>attempt it. On the other hand, they were as ready to
</p>
<p>undertake the defense of the President as Martin had
</p>
<p>been to assail him. What is more, they were as bold
</p>
<p>to assert the guilt of Burr as ever Jefferson had been.
</p>
<p>&quot;Before the gentlemen arraign the Administration,&quot;
</p>
<p>retorted Wirt, &quot;let them clear the skirts of their client.
</p>
<p>Let them prove his innocence.&quot;
</p>
<p>Wirt unconsciously expressed the real situation-
</p>
<p>Burr was on trial to show that the warp and woof of
</p>
<p>his garment were spotless; and many another before
</p>
<p>him, and after, has been likewise compelled. Innocent
</p>
<p>till proven guilty is a principle of our jurisprudence of
</p>
<p>which we sometimes boast when complaining of the
</p>
<p>legal procedure of other lands. That a letter might aid
</p>
<p>in making a defense a claim we know to have been
</p>
<p>well founded failed to appeal to the President ; he was
</p>
<p>already certain that the traitor had too long enjoyed
</p>
<p>repose and immunity. But if Jefferson chose not to
</p>
<p>yield up the correspondence, what might not the law
</p>
<p>impose? And Marshall decided June I3th, after sev
</p>
<p>eral days of argument, that the subpoena might issue.
</p>
<p>&quot;If, upon any principle,&quot; ran the heart of the opinion,
</p>
<p>&quot;the President could be construed to stand exempt from
</p>
<p>the general provisions of the Constitution, it would be
</p>
<p>because his duties as chief magistrate demand his whole
</p>
<p>time for national objects. But it is apparent that this
</p>
<p>demand is not unremitting; and if it should exist at the
</p>
<p>time when his attendance on a court is required, it would

</p>
<p>be sworn on the return of the subpoena, and would rather
</p>
<p>326 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>constitute a reason for not obeying the process of the
</p>
<p>court than a reason against its being issued. ... It
</p>
<p>cannot be denied that to issue a subpoena to a person fill
</p>
<p>ing the exalted station of the chief magistrate is a duty
</p>
<p>which would be dispensed with much more cheerfully
</p>
<p>than it would be performed ; but if it be a duty, the court
</p>
<p>can have no choice in the case.&quot;
</p>
<p>There was no answer to this argument, and yet
</p>
<p>Jefferson lashed into a violent rage by Martin s criti
</p>
<p>cisms of his conduct in the trial of Smith and Ogden
</p>
<p>in New York for complicity with Miranda, the Cabinet
</p>
<p>having been instructed to disregard the summons of the
</p>
<p>court, and by Marshall s decision which drew a line
</p>
<p>between Jefferson the Executive and Jefferson the citi
</p>
<p>zen essayed a reply :
</p>
<p>&quot;The leading feature of our Constitution,&quot; he said
</p>
<p>fretfully to Hay, 1 &quot;is the independence of the Legislative,
</p>
<p>Executive, and Judiciary of each other; and none are
</p>
<p>more jealous of this than the Judiciary. But would the
</p>
<p>Executive be independent of the Judiciary if he were
</p>
<p>subject to the commands of the latter, and to imprison
</p>
<p>ment for disobedience ; if the smaller courts could bandy
</p>
<p>him from pillar to post, keep him constantly trudging
</p>
<p>from north to south and east and west, and withdraw him
</p>
<p>entirely from his executive duties?&quot;
</p>
<p>Taking everything into account, Jefferson s posi
</p>
<p>tion was unassailable, but he had gone wide of the
</p>
<p>Chief- Justice s line of argument; Jefferson knew that
</p>
<p>the Chief Executive had no prerogatives which absolved
</p>
<p>him from the obligations of citizenship. The long and
</p>
<p>short of the matter was that he meant to exclude the
</p>
<p>General s correspondence from the trial. Had the dis.-
</p>
<p>patch of October 2ist been produced, it might have

<p>served as a prelude for the rendering of the whole of
</p>
<p>Wilkinson s discordant letters, which neither the powers
</p>
<p>of the President nor the genius of the General could
</p>
<p>have made to harmonize. That Jefferson, who denied

<p>the letters under the pretext of their confidential nature,

<p>deliberately violated the law which had found its
</p>
<p>development in the long struggle for personal liberty,

<p>it would be unfair to assume; but his conscience in
</p>
<p>this instance was easily satisfied. Years afterwards he
</p>
<p>wrote to John Adams, his old adversary, &quot;We have,
</p>
<p>willingly, done injury to no man.&quot; 1 Some of those
</p>
<p>interested in the trial at Richmond might have taken
</p>
<p>issue with the avowal. However, holding such an
</p>
<p>estimate of the rectitude of his conduct, he was excus
</p>
<p>able if his human instinct for retaliation came into play
</p>
<p>when Luther Martin, referring to the denial of the
</p>
<p>letters, inveighed that the author of the Declaration
</p>
<p>of Independence and believer in the doctrine that the
</p>
<p>world was too much governed was playing tyrant in a
</p>
<p>way not unworthy of King George himself. The charge
</p>
<p>drove Jefferson into gusts of passion. Fearful of the
</p>
<p>waxing strength of the Judiciary, he meant to defy to
</p>
<p>the utmost the decrees of the court ; if it came to that he
</p>
<p>would meet force with force, and while awaiting devel
</p>
<p>opments he gave private notice that if Marshall planned,
</p>
<p>by his odious measures, to precipitate a contest between
</p>
<p>the two departments of the Government, he should be
</p>
<p>notified by express. 2 It was one thing to decide that a
</p>
<p>subpoena duces tecum might issue and quite another to

<p>see the writ enforced. Marshall realized that civil war
</p>
<p>would be the final outcome and the matter was quietly
</p>
<p>dropped. Another prerogative was thereby added to
</p>
<p>the Presidential Office. To defy Marshall, however,
</p>
<p>was easier than to stay the right of free speech; and
</p>
<p>while this was preserved an enemy more to be dreaded
</p>
<p>than a posse comitatus continued his stinging attacks.
</p>
<p>Luther Martin was that enemy. Of Jefferson he
</p>
<p>asked no quarter and gave none &quot;My head or yours,&quot;
</p>
<p>in the legend of the Orient, might have been the chal

<p>lenge for Burr s cause was Martin s. Jefferson read
</p>
<p>out of this ardent friendship a community of interest
</p>
<p>embracing misprision of treason.
</p>
<p>&quot;Shall we move to commit Luther Martin,&quot; wrote
</p>
<p>Jefferson to Hay, &quot;as particeps criminis with Burr?
</p>
<p>Graybell will fix upon him misprision of treason at least.
</p>
<p>And at any rate his evidence will put down this unprin
</p>
<p>cipled and impudent Federal bulldog, and add another
</p>
<p>proof that the most clamorous defenders of Burr are all
</p>
<p>his accomplices.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>Nothing more was heard of Graybell, but Martin
</p>
<p>bated never a whit of his ardor ; and the arrival of Wil
</p>
<p>kinson at this juncture introduced an element of much
</p>
<p>greater interest into the case, and the side quarrel was
</p>
<p>forgotten. June I5th the General appeared in Rich
</p>
<p>mond. For almost a month the grand jury had been
</p>
<p>awaiting his arrival. It was therefore apparent that
</p>
<p>upon him the prosecution leaned its weight.
</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Hay tells us,&quot; declared Edmund Randolph in de

</p>
<p>Wilkinson had only begun his narrative before the

<p>jurymen when, June i/th, he dispatched to the Presi
</p>
<p>dent a letter which was not only an appeal for help,
</p>
<p>but an irrepressible outcry against a Nemesis which
</p>
<p>threatened to sweep him and his plots into oblivion.
</p>
<p>It was characteristic of the man whose agent had
</p>
<p>just returned empty-handed from Mexico, and who
</p>
<p>had come to Richmond with witnesses under mili
</p>
<p>tary duress to explain to Jefferson that he had devoted
</p>
<p>most of the time since his arrival to the Vindica

<p>tion of the abandoned wretch who had dared to impli

</p>
<p>&quot;I dreampt not of the importance attached to my
</p>
<p>presence,&quot; he continued, &quot;before I reached Hampton,
</p>
<p>. . . for I had anticipated that a deluge of testimony
</p>
<p>would have been poured forth from all quarters to over
</p>
<p>whelm him [Burr] with guilt and dishonor. Sadly, in
</p>
<p>deed, was I mistaken, and to my astonishment I found the
</p>
<p>traitor vindicated and myself condemned by a mass of
</p>
<p>wealth, character, influence, and talents. Merciful God,
</p>
<p>what a spectacle did I behold integrity and truth per
</p>
<p>verted and trampled under foot by turpitude and guilt,
</p>
<p>patriotism appalled and usurpation triumphant. Did I
</p>
<p>ever expect it would depend on my humble self to stop
</p>
<p>the current of such a polluted stream ? Never, never.&quot;
</p>
<p>In the whole annals of the conspiracy there is
</p>
<p>nothing quite as becoming, as apropos to the situation,

<p>as Wilkinson s pose of injured hero. That he was

<p>much disturbed at the paucity of the evidence is likely ;

</p>
<p>but he was conscious that for seven months he had left
</p>
<p>nothing undone to contribute his quota to the &quot;deluge.&quot;
</p>
<p>The same letter contained a succinct account of his
</p>
<p>advent into court, and of his meeting with Burr :
</p>
<p>&quot;I was introduced to a position within the bar very
</p>
<p>near my adversary. I saluted the bench and in spite of
</p>
<p>myself my eyes darted a flash of indignation at the little
</p>
<p>traitor, on whom they continued fixed until I was called
</p>
<p>to the Book ; here, sir, I found my expectations verified
</p>
<p>this lion-hearted, eagle-eyed Hero, jerking under the
</p>
<p>weight of conscious guilt, with haggard eyes in an effort
</p>
<p>to meet the indignant salutation of outraged honor ; but it
</p>
<p>was in vain, his audacity failed him. He averted his
</p>
<p>face, grew pale, and affected passion to conceal his per
</p>
<p>turbation.&quot;
</p>
<p>Washington Irving, who was an eye-witness, has
</p>
<p>also left us an account of this incident :
</p>
<p>&quot;Wilkinson strutted into court, and took his stand in a
</p>
<p>parallel line with Burr on his right hand. Here he stood
</p>
<p>for a moment swelling like a turkey-cock, and bracing
</p>
<p>himself up for the encounter of Burr s eye. The latter
</p>
<p>did not take any notice of him until the judge directed
</p>
<p>the clerk to swear General Wilkinson ; at the mention of
</p>
<p>the name Burr turned his head, looked him full in the
</p>
<p>face with one of his piercing regards, swept his eye over
</p>
<p>his whole person from head to foot, as if to scan its di
</p>
<p>mensions, and then coolly resumed his former position,
</p>
<p>and went on conversing with his counsel as tranquilly as
</p>
<p>ever. The whole look was over in an instant ; but it was
</p>
<p>an admirable one. There was no appearance of study or
</p>
<p>constraint in it ; no affectation of disdain or defiance ; a
</p>
<p>slight expression of contempt played over his counte
</p>
<p>nance.&quot; 1

</p>
<p>There can be no hesitation in saying which is
</p>
<p>the truer picture. Wilkinson s letter was remarkably
</p>
<p>diplomatic, and, though displaying villainy in every

<p>*Life and Letters of Washington Irving, i., 194.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL AT RICHMOND 331
</p>
<p>line, worked its purpose with Jefferson. The plaintive
</p>
<p>tone appealed to the President and he hastened with
</p>
<p>his sympathy and encouragement.
</p>
<p>&quot;Your enemies,&quot; he returned promptly, 1 &quot;have filled
</p>
<p>the public ear with slanders and your mind with trouble
</p>
<p>on that account. The establishment of their guilt will let
</p>
<p>the world see what they ought to think of their clamors ;
</p>
<p>it will dissipate the doubts of those who doubted for want
</p>
<p>of knowledge, and will place you on higher ground in the
</p>
<p>public estimate and public confidence. No one is more
</p>
<p>sensible than myself of the injustice which has been aimed
</p>
<p>at you. Accept, I pray you, my salutations and assurances
</p>
<p>of respect and esteem.&quot;
</p>
<p>Sincerity pervaded every line of this letter; and,
</p>
<p>since he thought Wilkinson honest, he regarded all
</p>
<p>those who antagonized him as sympathizers with the
</p>
<p>conspirators. They were to be rebuked by the con
</p>
<p>viction of Burr. Three months before this, how
</p>
<p>ever, it had been determined that Wilkinson was to
</p>
<p>be sustained. When Major Bruff reached Washing
</p>
<p>ton in March, 1807, Dearborn heard Wilkinson ac
</p>
<p>cused of being a spy of Spain and of having been in
</p>
<p>league with Burr; but the Secretary, who knew that
</p>
<p>Bruff and the General had been quarreling for more
</p>
<p>than a year, filing charges and counter-charges against
</p>
<p>each other, informed Bruff that Wilkinson had restored
</p>
<p>his waning reputation by the energy displayed in the
</p>
<p>defense of New Orleans, and that the President would
</p>
<p>not desert him at some later time an inquiry might be
</p>
<p>ordered. The Attorney-General stated the situation
</p>
<p>more pointedly. He asked Bruff, &quot;What would be the

<p>! result if all&quot; the charges against General Wilkinson
</p>
<p>&quot;should be proven ? Why, just what the Federalists and
</p>
<p>the enemies of the present Administration wish it
</p>
<p>would turn the indignation of the people from Burr on
</p>
<p>Wilkinson ; Burr would escape, and Wilkinson take his
</p>
<p>Xlace.&quot; x
</p>
<p>Scarcely had the General had time to take comfort
</p>
<p>rom the President s letter of June 2ist when the de
</p>
<p>fense prayed for an attachment against him for con
</p>
<p>tempt of court.
</p>
<p>&quot;The charge against General Wilkinson was,&quot; to use
</p>
<p>Randolph s language, &quot;that he had, in conjunction with
</p>
<p>others, used unlawful and oppressive means, under color
</p>
<p>and in abuse of the process of this court, to bring James
</p>
<p>Knox and Chandler Lindsley from New Orleans to this
</p>
<p>city ; and thus had obstructed the free course of testimony,
</p>
<p>and the fair and regular administration of justice.&quot;
</p>
<p>The twenty-fourth of June, while a heated debate
</p>
<p>over the question of the attachment was in progress,
</p>
<p>the grand jury filed in and reported two indictments
</p>
<p>against Aaron Burr one for misdemeanor, the other
</p>
<p>for treason. Similar indictments were returned against
</p>
<p>Blennerhassett. Wilkinson had done part of the work
</p>
<p>necessary to save his official head ; but he had accom
</p>
<p>plished it at extreme peril, narrowly escaping indict
</p>
<p>ment himself. John Randolph, his vindictive enemy
</p>
<p>and foreman of the grand jury, has left us an inter
</p>
<p>esting record of Wilkinson s appearance before that
</p>
<p>body. He said in a letter to Nicholson : 2 &quot;Under exam
</p>
<p>ination all was confusion of language and of looks.

</p>
<p>THE TRIAL AT RICHMOND 333
</p>
<p>Such a countenance never did I behold; there was
</p>
<p>scarcely a variance of opinion among us as to his guilt.&quot;
</p>
<p>Had Wilkinson read this account, his challenge of Ran
</p>
<p>dolph to a duel would scarcely have been delayed until
</p>
<p>December; and Randolph would have written earlier
</p>
<p>the very excuse Wilkinson himself had offered Swart-
</p>
<p>wout when invited by the latter to settle their disputes
</p>
<p>on the field of honor : &quot;In you, sir,&quot; said Randolph, &quot;I
</p>
<p>can recognize no right to hold me accountable for my
</p>
<p>public or private opinion of your character, ... I
</p>
<p>cannot descend to your level.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>In another letter Randolph went more into detail,
</p>
<p>telling of the labors of the grand jury and stating more
</p>
<p>emphatically his opinion of the General :
</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday the grand jury found bills for treason and
</p>
<p>misdemeanor against Burr and Blennerhassett una voce,
</p>
<p>and this day presented Jonathan Dayton, ex-senator John
</p>
<p>Smith of Ohio, Comfort Tyler, Israel Smith of New
</p>
<p>York, and Davis Floyd of Indiana, for treason; but the
</p>
<p>mammoth of iniquity escaped, not that any man pretended
</p>
<p>to think him innocent, but upon certain wire-drawn dis
</p>
<p>tinctions that I will not pester you with. Wilkinson is the \
</p>
<p>only man that I ever saw who was from the bark to the
</p>
<p>very core a villain. The proof is unquestionable ; but, &amp;lt;
</p>
<p>my good friend, I cannot enter upon it here. Suffice it
</p>
<p>to say that I have seen it, and that it is not susceptible
</p>
<p>of misconstruction. Burr supported himself with great
</p>
<p>fortitude. He was last night lodged in the common jail
</p>
<p>(we have no State prison except for convicts), where I
</p>
<p>dare say he slept sounder than I did. Perhaps you never
</p>
<p>saw human nature in so degraded a situation as in the
</p>
<p>person of Wilkinson before the grand jury ; and yet this

<p>man stands on the very summit and pinnacle of Exec

<p>334 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>Randolph s estimate of Wilkinson s character has
</p>
<p>been conspicuously borne out by history, and further
</p>
<p>attests the penetrative genius of the statesman of
</p>
<p>Roanoke. Although he failed to secure an indictment
</p>
<p>against the General, those who knew the tenacity
</p>
<p>with which he pursued his ends could not but expect
</p>
<p>another struggle and they were not disappointed.
</p>
<p>The streets of the capital of Virginia were scarcely
</p>
<p>abandoned by the crowd it was the last day of 1807
</p>
<p>when Randolph arose in Congress, read a number of
</p>
<p>documents bearing on Wilkinson s early relations with
</p>
<p>the Spaniards, and offered the following Resolution :
</p>
<p>&quot;Resolved, That the President of the United States be
</p>
<p>requested to cause an inquiry to be instituted into the
</p>
<p>conduct of Brigadier-General Wilkinson, commander-in-
</p>
<p>chief of the armies of the United States, in relation to his
</p>
<p>having, at any time, while in the service of the United
</p>
<p>States, corruptly received money from the government of
</p>
<p>Spain or its agents.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>From the first it was Randolph s purpose to show
</p>
<p>that Wilkinson, for a long period of years, had been
</p>
<p>playing a double role that he had not only been once
</p>
<p>in league with Baron de Carondelet in the Spanish Con
</p>
<p>spiracy, but that he still preserved that connection ; that
</p>
<p>he had been a coadjutor of Burr in a plot which
</p>
<p>embraced the vital principle of the older treason, while
</p>
<p>posing before the world as an ardent, maligned patriot.
</p>
<p>In his anxiety to incriminate Jefferson with the man
</p>
<p>whom he considered a double traitor, Randolph went
</p>
<p>headlong to his own political ruin. It is probable indeed

<p>that he sought more to prevent the succession of Madi
</p>
<p>son than to punish Wilkinson; in either case the end
</p>
<p>sought was the same a Spanish war, which would
</p>
<p>mean the overthrow of his political adversaries, who
</p>
<p>had so long procrastinated. He would compel the war
</p>
<p>by proving that James Wilkinson, General of the Army
</p>
<p>of the United States, had accepted money from Don
</p>
<p>Carlos to divide the Union by the Alleghanies. Does
</p>
<p>not the &quot;Constitution enjoin,&quot; queried Randolph, &quot;that
</p>
<p>the persons holding authority under this Government
</p>
<p>should not accept of any present, even of a compliment
</p>
<p>ary nature, from any foreign Prince or Power without
</p>
<p>the consent of Congress?&quot; Another day, during the
</p>
<p>debate on his resolution, in reply to the question,
</p>
<p>whether there was not a motion before the grand jury
</p>
<p>to find a bill against General Wilkinson, Randolph said
</p>
<p>reminiscently that &quot;There was before the grand jury a
</p>
<p>motion to present General Wilkinson for misprision of
</p>
<p>treason&quot; ; that he had escaped on a &quot;legal exception or a
</p>
<p>fraud ; but the jury was unanimous in the belief of the
</p>
<p>moral guilt of the party.&quot; 1 The truth was the General
</p>
<p>had been saved by those of the jury who realized what
</p>
<p>the prosecution confessed, that if Burr was to be con
</p>
<p>victed it must be by Wilkinson s testimony. He was
</p>
<p>therefore saved by a close vote nine to seven, accord
</p>
<p>ing to a member of the grand jury who subsequently
</p>
<p>( 181 1 ) testified before a committee of Congress, which
</p>
<p>body was still probing for the rottenness they believed to
</p>
<p>exist, but which defied their most searching investiga
</p>
<p>tions. For the leading State witness so narrowly to

</p>
<p>escape an indictment was a fate peculiarly surprising
</p>
<p>and melancholy. The failure of the attachment pro
</p>
<p>ceedings against the General brought him no consola
</p>
<p>tion shocked, he went again with falsehoods to Jeffer
</p>
<p>son for relief.
</p>
<p>&quot;You are doubtless well advised of the proceedings
</p>
<p>here in the case of Burr,&quot; he apologetically began; &quot;to
</p>
<p>me they are incomprehensible as I am no jurist. The
</p>
<p>grand jury actually made an attempt to present me for
</p>
<p>suspicion of treason on the ground of having failed to
</p>
<p>report Dayton to you. I feel myself between Scylla and
</p>
<p>Charybdis. The jury would dishonor me for failing in
</p>
<p>my duty, and Burr and his conspirators for perform
</p>
<p>ing it.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>More than a year afterward he still complained of
</p>
<p>the arrows of outrageous fortune. To Simon de Her-
</p>
<p>rera he wrote, October 12, 1808 :
</p>
<p>&quot;It has ever been the lot of men in exalted station to be
</p>
<p>traduced by those who envy actions they cannot emulate ;
</p>
<p>and it is equally true that the arrestation of a vicious
</p>
<p>career, and the prostration of sinister ambition, have al
</p>
<p>ways excited the most vindictive passions of the human
</p>
<p>breast. It is my misfortune that I should be able to illus
</p>
<p>trate these diabolical propensities in the infamous at
</p>
<p>tempts made by the traitorous compeers and partisans of
</p>
<p>Burr, upon my fame and fortune ; because the inclinations
</p>
<p>of my heart, the dictates of my honor, and the obligations
</p>
<p>of duty, compelled me to discomfit his vile complottings
</p>
<p>against the United States and the dominions of Spain.&quot; 2
</p>
<p>Then he said that among a hundred other base calumnies
</p>
<p>it had been asserted that he had entered into a truce
</p>
<p>with the enemy on the Sabine and had received as com
</p>
<p>pensation several mule-loads of dollars. &quot;This is a

<p>authors to shame.&quot; But Captain Hughes, who had the
</p>
<p>honor to deliver the letter to the Colonel in San An
</p>
<p>tonio, returned unburdened with any written message.
</p>
<p>Were we not acquainted with the inner workings
</p>
<p>of Wilkinson s manoeuvres during this period, he would
</p>
<p>have our sympathy in this gloomy hour when it seemed
</p>
<p>his own misdeeds were about to overwhelm him. One
</p>
<p>is startled into admiration by the very audacity and
</p>
<p>sang-froid of the man. He who had sent Burling to
</p>
<p>Mexico could say to the President i 1
</p>
<p>&quot;I know, sir, that I have saved this country from
</p>
<p>anarchy at least and I believe that I have defeated tho
</p>
<p>last hope of your personal and political enemies; these
</p>
<p>reflections passed to the amount of gratitude and pat-
</p>
<p>triotism, furnish an endless source of self applause and
</p>
<p>will soothe the pillow of death ; and when the object ceases
</p>
<p>to be, the angry passions will slumber, candor and truth
</p>
<p>will resume their empire, and posterity will do justice to
</p>
<p>my name and service.&quot;
</p>
<p>With phenomenal success Wilkinson played the
</p>
<p>part of the wronged and injured savior of his country,
</p>
<p>maintaining that the very people he had rescued were
</p>
<p>become his revilers.
</p>
<p>As the time approached for the real work of the
</p>
<p>trial it was discovered by the Government that the case
</p>
<p>needed strengthening. As a last resort patronage and
</p>
<p>the pardoning power of the Executive were to be in-

<p>voked. The latter weapon had been suggested by
</p>
<p>Wilkinson as early as February, when he had said to
</p>
<p>the President that by sending Tyler around he might be
</p>
<p>induced to give important testimony, provided he were
</p>
<p>given a pardon. 1 Upon the General s arrival in Rich
</p>
<p>mond he informed Jefferson of De Pestre s presence
</p>
<p>and of his belief that De Pestre knew much which might
</p>
<p>be drawn from him by presenting him with a pardon
</p>
<p>the day he was examined. 2 The suggestion was not
</p>
<p>unheeded. The Government s agent &quot;had the delicacy
</p>
<p>to insinuate how handsomely the colonel [De Pestre]
</p>
<p>might be provided for in the army, if his principles or
</p>
<p>engagements were not averse to the Administration.&quot;*
</p>
<p>Jefferson was determined that at least one man should
</p>
<p>receive the full penalty of the law, and he was probably
</p>
<p>never in a more malicious frame of mind than when
</p>
<p>he said to Hay :
</p>
<p>&quot;Blank pardons are sent on to be filled up at your dis
</p>
<p>cretion, if you should find a defect of evidence, and believe
</p>
<p>that this would supply it, avoiding to give them to the
</p>
<p>gross offenders unless it be visible that the principal will
</p>
<p>otherwise escape.&quot;*
</p>
<p>This fear that the &quot;principal&quot; would escape became
</p>
<p>so intense that the sane and benevolent Jefferson
</p>
<p>was driven to deeds he must have repented in his
</p>
<p>calmer hours. When Bollman had been released
</p>
<p>by the court he repaired to Washington to urge the

<p>President to countenance the expedition which Burr

</p>
<p>had planned against Mexico, arguing that the best
</p>
<p>interests of the country would be served by a war
</p>
<p>with Spain. Jefferson requested Bollman to put his
</p>
<p>statements in writing, assuring him &quot;that nothing he
</p>
<p>might say or acknowledge should be made use of
</p>
<p>against himself.&quot; * According to Bollman the Presi
</p>
<p>dent promised that the paper &quot;should never go out of
</p>
<p>his hands.&quot; 2 Notwithstanding this pledge, the docu
</p>
<p>ment was sent to Hay. &quot;Even go so far as ask him,&quot;
</p>
<p>read the accompanying note of instructions, 3 &quot;if he had
</p>
<p>not said such and such to Madison and Jefferson.&quot;
</p>
<p>Finally, if Bollman, for whom a pardon had been
</p>
<p>enclosed, persisted, he was to be shown the MS. for
</p>
<p>the identification of which several of his letters were
</p>
<p>inclosed. He refused to accept the pardon and appealed
</p>
<p>to the grand jury to rescue him from disgrace. 4 Jeffer
</p>
<p>son s object in thrusting a pardon upon Bollman was
</p>
<p>to compel his testimony, for excuse could not then be
</p>
<p>found in the plea of self-incrimination. But Jefferson s
</p>
<p>tactics were extraordinary; to pardon an individual
</p>
<p>before he has pleaded guilty or been convicted was cer
</p>
<p>tainly an Executive innovation.
</p>
<p>Burr never grasped the full significance of his
</p>
<p>trial. June 26th he had pleaded not guilty to the in
</p>
<p>dictment for treason, and the court was adjourned until
</p>

<p>THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>&quot;The scenes which have passed/ he wrote at the close
</p>
<p>of July to Theodosia, who was on her way to Richmond, 1
</p>
<p>&quot;and those about to be transacted will exceed all reason
</p>
<p>able credulity, and will hereafter be deemed fables, unless
</p>
<p>attested by very high authority. I repeat, what has here
</p>
<p>tofore been written, that I should never invite any one,
</p>
<p>much less those so dear to me, to witness my disgrace. I
</p>
<p>may be immured in dungeons, chained, murdered in legal
</p>
<p>form, but I cannot be humiliated or disgraced. If absent
</p>
<p>you will suffer great solicitude. In my presence you will
</p>
<p>feel none, whatever may be the malice or the power of
</p>
<p>my enemies, and in both they abound.&quot;
</p>
<p>From a gloomy view of things Burr had the faculty
</p>
<p>of turning with a light-heartedness that was at once an
</p>
<p>inspiration to his friends and a defiance to his enemies.
</p>
<p>Writing from the penitentiary to his daughter, he said,
</p>
<p>&quot;I have a gre*at desire to receive you all in this man
</p>
<p>sion. -: . . Pray, therefore, drive directly out here.
</p>
<p>You may get admission at any time from four in the
</p>
<p>morning till ten at night.&quot; When they arrived, a few
</p>
<p>hours bSore the sitting of court, he apologized for
</p>
<p>their being introduced into his bed-chamber his draw
</p>
<p>ing-room, he said, was then deranged by the fitting up
</p>
<p>of his ice-house. 2
</p>
<p>August 3d the trial of Aaron Burr on the charge
</p>
<p>of treason began in earnest. The House of Burgesses,
</p>
<p>which is still one of the landmarks of Richmond, was
</p>
<p>filled to overflowing with sightseers and partisans when
</p>
<p>Burr, accompanied by Alston, walked into court.
</p>
<p>Prominent and outspoken as were some of Burr s ad
</p>
<p>herents, his cause was irrevocably attainted in the
</p>
<p>public mind. This was forcibly illustrated in the
</p>
<p>Parton s Burr, ii., 127.

<p>THE TRIAL AT RICHMOND 341
</p>
<p>matter of selecting a jury a labor which consumed
</p>
<p>two weeks. Even then the accused was obliged to
</p>
<p>accept men like Parker, who admitted that they were
</p>
<p>prejudiced against him. Out of the first venire of forty-
</p>
<p>eight men, four were chosen ; out of the second, none ;
</p>
<p>out of the third, eight.
</p>
<p>It was apparent from the preliminary skirmishes
</p>
<p>that the fight would be made on the interpretation of
</p>
<p>the clause in the Constitution which declares that
</p>
<p>&quot;Treason against the United States shall consist only
</p>
<p>in levying war against them&quot; ; and That no person
</p>
<p>shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of
</p>
<p>two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in
</p>
<p>open court.&quot; So when William Eaton, the first wit
</p>
<p>ness, took the stand, the defence urged the inadmis-
</p>
<p>sibility of evidence which did not go towards proving
</p>
<p>an overt act of war. The court held that in order to
</p>
<p>show that war had actually been levied, it was neces
</p>
<p>sary to discover the design, and to prove the overt act
</p>
<p>by two witnesses. Eaton was therefore permitted to
</p>
<p>give his testimony, which was expected to reveal the
</p>
<p>projects entertained by Burr.
</p>
<p>&quot;During the winter of 1805-06,&quot; said the hero of
</p>
<p>Derne, &quot;(I cannot be positive as to the distinct point of
</p>
<p>time ; yet during that winter), at the City of Washington,
</p>
<p>Aaron Burr signified to me that he was organizing a mili
</p>
<p>tary expedition to be moved against the Spanish provinces
</p>
<p>on the southwestern frontiers of the United States : I un
</p>
<p>derstood under the authority of the general Government.

</p>
<p>the feasibility of penetrating to Mexico. At length, from

</p>
<p>342 THE ARRON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>a suspicion, that Colonel Burr had other projects. . . .
</p>
<p>[He] now laid open his project of revolutionizing the
</p>
<p>territory west of the Alleghany ; establishing an independ
</p>
<p>ent empire there ; New Orleans to be the capital, and he
</p>
<p>himself to be the chief; organizing a military force on
</p>
<p>the waters of the Mississippi, and carrying conquest to
</p>
<p>Mexico.&quot;
</p>
<p>Besides these extensive plans the witness deposed
</p>
<p>that Burr had proposed to him the revolutionizing of
</p>
<p>the Central Government, after the fashion of Dayton s
</p>
<p>story to Yrujo. That Eaton had been three years
</p>
<p>pressing on Congress a somewhat doubtful claim for
</p>
<p>money expended in the War with Tripoli may not
</p>
<p>have turned a phrase in his deposition ; but it is signifi
</p>
<p>cant that a few weeks after its appearance $10,000 were
</p>
<p>placed to his credit. Congress had been a long time
</p>
<p>in discovering that the Nation was really indebted to
</p>
<p>the officer who had once been convicted of peculation
</p>
<p>by court-martial. If the country was slow in appre
</p>
<p>ciating the sacrifices of Eaton in the Barbary Wars, it
</p>
<p>was prompt in recognizing the value of his services at
</p>
<p>the crisis of the Conspiracy. He had the satisfaction

<p>of writing i 1

<p>for it was not until my public exposure had alarmed Gen

<p>THE TRIAL AT RICHMOND 343
</p>
<p>Between Eaton and Wilkinson it would be difficult
</p>
<p>indeed to decide upon whose brow the palm for Spartan
</p>
<p>heroism should rest both claimed to have saved the
</p>
<p>country. Through the notoriety won in the case Eaton
</p>
<p>was elected to Congress, but his biographer admits that
</p>
<p>&quot;the acquittal of Burr ... in some measure
</p>
<p>soured his mind, and the hope of promotion in the
</p>
<p>army, by gratifying the ruling administration, occa
</p>
<p>sioned at times a considerable swerving from his con
</p>
<p>victions.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>Commodore Truxton was the second witness for
</p>
<p>the Government. In a letter to Alston he had stated in
</p>
<p>brief what he knew of Burr s plans, and that he simply
</p>
<p>repeated : 2
</p>
<p>&quot;The intention of Mr. Burr, as has been stated, to
</p>
<p>sever the Union (a most diabolical project), was first
</p>
<p>suggested to me by Western newspapers. . . . But it
</p>
<p>is true Mr. Burr did tell me that in case of war between
</p>
<p>the United States and Spain, which he considered in
</p>
<p>evitable, he intended to attack Vera Cruz and Mexico,
</p>
<p>give liberty to an enslaved world, and establish an inde
</p>
<p>pendent Government in Mexico; and invited me to take
</p>
<p>command of the expedition by sea.&quot;
</p>
<p>He added at the trial that Burr had expressly stated
</p>
<p>that his designs on Mexico were based on the contin
</p>
<p>gency of war with Spain.
</p>
<p>&quot;I told him there would be no war. He was sanguine
</p>
<p>there would be war. He said, however, that if he was
</p>
<p>disappointed as to the event of war, he was about to com-

</p>
<p>Washita; that he intended to invite his friends to settle
</p>
<p>it ; that in one year he would have a thousand families of
</p>
<p>respectable and fashionable people, and some of them of
</p>
<p>j considerable property : that it was a fine country, and that
</p>
<p>they would have a charming society, and in two years he
</p>
<p>would have double the number of settlers ; and being on
</p>
<p>the frontier, he would be ready to move whenever a war
</p>
<p>took place.&quot;
</p>
<p>The Morgans were next called ; their testimony was
</p>
<p>in line with their letters to the President, which have
</p>
<p>been noted. 1 The climax of their evidence was the con
</p>
<p>fession that more was to be inferred from the manner
</p>
<p>of Burr s speech than from what he actually said. Peter
</p>
<p>Taylor, Blennerhassett s gardener, also bore witness to
</p>
<p>the design. He said that the conspirators were going
</p>
<p>to take Mexico ; that Burr was to be king and was to be
</p>
<p>succeeded at his death by his daughter; and that two
</p>
<p>thousand priests with their friends were ready to join
</p>
<p>an insurrection.
</p>
<p>&quot;I then asked [Blennerhassett],&quot; said Taylor, &quot;what
</p>
<p>was to become of the men who were going to settle the
</p>
<p>lands he talked about? Were they to stop at the Red
</p>
<p>River, or to go on ? He said, O by God, I tell you, Peter,
</p>
<p>every man that will not conform to order and discipline,
</p>
<p>I will stab ; you ll see how I ll fix them ; that when he got
</p>
<p>them far enough down the river, if they did not conform
</p>
<p>to order and discipline, he swore by God he d stab them.&quot;
</p>
<p>So much for the design. The prosecution now took
</p>
<p>up its witnesses to prove that an act of war had been
</p>
<p>committed. Dudley Woodbriclge testified that he was
</p>
<p>on the island at the time specified in the indictment,

<p>but that he saw no unlawful assemblage of men. He
</p>
<p>added that Blennerhassett had told him that the expedi
</p>
<p>tion was intended for Mexico, and had solicited him to
</p>
<p>join. Jacob Allbright, an ignorant laborer, with Peter
</p>
<p>Taylor, became in the eyes of the defense, &quot;a brace
</p>
<p>of swearers from Wood County.&quot; The testimony of
</p>
<p>both was open to serious question, while that of All-
</p>
<p>bright was discredited on cross-examination. He swore
</p>
<p>one thing on the stand and had made affidavit to some
</p>
<p>thing substantially different, narrating that on the
</p>
<p>night of the flight,
</p>
<p>&quot;a man by the name of Tupper laid his hands upon Blen
</p>
<p>nerhassett, and said, Your body is in my hands, in the
</p>
<p>name of the Commonwealth/ Some such words as that
</p>
<p>he mentioned. When Tupper made that motion, there
</p>
<p>were seven or eight muskets leveled at him. Tupper
</p>
<p>looked about him and said, Gentlemen, I hope you will
</p>
<p>not do the like. One of the gentlemen nearest, about
</p>
<p>two yards off, said, Td as lieve as not. Tupper then
</p>
<p>changed his speech, and said he wished him to escape safe
</p>
<p>down the river, and wished him luck.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>This was the very act of levying war upon which
</p>
<p>the Government rested its case. Unfortunately, how
</p>
<p>ever, there was none other to confirm Allbright s vision ;
</p>
<p>indeed, according to Blennerhassett, Tupper was present
</p>
<p>in Richmond and ready to pronounce the story unquali
</p>
<p>fiedly false. Wickham taunted the prosecution with
</p>
<p>fearing to examine Tupper, whom they had summoned.
</p>
<p>&quot;Their not doing it,&quot; he said, &quot;proves that they

<p>thought he would contradict Allbright.&quot; 2 Taylor

<p>346 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>whose veracity would have been assailed by Dr. Bennett
</p>
<p>and others Love, Poole, Belknap and Dana were also
</p>
<p>interrogated with a view to showing that war had been
</p>
<p>levied; but Allbright could not be reenforced. Thus
</p>
<p>August 2Oth, when Hay at length admitted that he had
</p>
<p>produced all the witnesses at his command to establish
</p>
<p>the fact of war, and attempted to introduce collateral
</p>
<p>testimony. Burr s counsel moved the arrestation of the
</p>
<p>evidence on the ground that no overt act, constituting
</p>
<p>treason under the Constitution, had been proven. This
</p>
<p>manoeuvre had been threatened for several days; and
</p>
<p>the State denounced it as a deliberate attempt to throttle
</p>
<p>the investigation. But the motion was entertained.
</p>
<p>Through a period of ten days the most remarkable
</p>
<p>legal encounter known in our history was waged, both
</p>
<p>sides contesting every inch of the ground ; for the deci
</p>
<p>sion was vital the prevailing of the motion meant the
</p>
<p>end of the trial for treason.
</p>
<p>It was contended by the defense, first, that no overt
</p>
<p>act of war, as charged in the indictment, had been
</p>
<p>established. It was therefore the duty of the court to
</p>
<p>exclude further testimony concerning acts and deeds
</p>
<p>committed, or alleged to have been committed, beyond
</p>
<p>its jurisdiction. The second contention was &quot;that no
</p>
<p>person can be convicted of treason in levying war, who
</p>
<p>was not personally present at the commission of the act,
</p>
<p>which is charged in the indictment as constituting the
</p>
<p>offense.&quot; The Constitution says plainly that &quot;no
</p>
<p>person shall be convicted, unless on the testimony of
</p>
<p>two witnesses to the same overt act.&quot; It was admitted

<p>must follow the conviction of a principal, since he was
</p>
<p>himself not present when the alleged act constituting
</p>
<p>treason was committed.
</p>
<p>Hay, with his associates, angered at the presump
</p>
<p>tion of the defense, feebly assailed these positions.
</p>
<p>According to the District- Attorney, &quot;An assemblage of
</p>
<p>men convened for the purpose of effecting by force a
</p>
<p>treasonable object, and which force is meant to be
</p>
<p>employed before their dispersion, is an overt act of
</p>
<p>levying war against the United States.&quot; Although
</p>
<p>absent, it was held that Burr was present on the island
</p>
<p>at the specified time, in a legal sense; that he had pro
</p>
<p>cured and inspired the gathering, and that he was there
</p>
<p>fore, in reason, the principal. Consequently it would be a
</p>
<p>prostitution of the law to interfere with the course of
</p>
<p>the evidence, the &quot;most important&quot; being held in re
</p>
<p>serve. In the minds of the prosecution it would have
</p>
<p>been difficult to say whether the judge was more cul
</p>
<p>pable for entertaining the motion, or the defense for
</p>
<p>pressing it.
</p>
<p>Thus were the two sides arrayed ; each busy with
</p>
<p>massing its arguments, which were directed chiefly to
</p>
<p>the analysis of legal principles, while John Marshall,

<p>whose marvelous sanity was never clouded, held the
</p>
<p>348 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>scales of justice. Wickham opened the debate and
</p>
<p>won renown in a discussion of the nature of treason.
</p>
<p>Luther Martin, whom Blennerhassett termed the whole
</p>
<p>rear guard of Burr s forensic army, spoke fourteen
</p>
<p>hours, presenting a masterly argument, distinguished
</p>
<p>alike for its familiarity with English precedent and for
</p>
<p>its erudite knowledge of the law concerning treason.
</p>
<p>Such ardor and ability have rarely been combined; and
</p>
<p>Martin s interest in Burr s case was heightened because
</p>
<p>of the fascination cast over him by the beautiful Theo-
</p>
<p>dosia, to whom he referred touchingly in the opening
</p>
<p>of his great speech. McRae appeared to better advan
</p>
<p>tage than hitherto, while Wirt rose to fame more endur
</p>
<p>ing than he could have dreamed of in an oratorical
</p>
<p>effort depicting the characters of Burr and Blennerhas
</p>
<p>sett : &quot;Who Aaron Burr is we have seen in part already.
</p>
<p>. . . Who is Blennerhassett? A native of Ireland,
</p>
<p>a man of letters, who fled from the storms of his own
</p>
<p>country to find quiet in ours.&quot; Mr. Botts and Mr. Ran
</p>
<p>dolph both came in for a share of triumph. The Dis

<p>trict-Attorney argued well and skillfully, but, in the
</p>
<p>midst of the debate, purposely or otherwise, he assumed
</p>
<p>a threatening attitude toward the court, insinuating
</p>
<p>that for the rendering of an opinion substantially
</p>
<p>similar to the one desired by the defense that is, &quot;to

<p>wrest the decision from the jury, and prejudge the case

</p>
<p>of the danger of a decision of the motion in favor of the
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL AT RICHMOND 349
</p>
<p>prisoner: a decision like that, which had already pro
</p>
<p>duced the impeachment of another judge. ... It
</p>
<p>certainly would not be unfair to infer, that it was intended
</p>
<p>to show the same cause might again produce the same
</p>
<p>effect.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>Hay protested that he had spoken inadvertently,
</p>
<p>and Marshall stated that he had not taken it as a per
</p>
<p>sonal allusion ; but the fact remains that the matter was
</p>
<p>not therewith ended. That impeachment was a house
</p>
<p>hold word with Jefferson, that he meditated another
</p>
<p>trial at arms with the Federal judiciary was known to
</p>
<p>Marshall, who rode into the lists with a quiet dignity
</p>
<p>becoming the invincible knight. In the course of his
</p>
<p>opinion, which was pronounced August 3ist, ran the
</p>
<p>lines :
</p>
<p>&quot;Much has been said in the course of the argument on
</p>
<p>points on which the Court feels no inclination to comment
</p>
<p>particularly, but which may perhaps not improperly re
</p>
<p>ceive some notice. That this Court dares not usurp power
</p>
<p>is most true; that this Court dares not shrink from its
</p>
<p>duty is not less true. No man is desirous of placing him
</p>
<p>self in a disagreeable situation ; no man is desirous of be
</p>
<p>coming the peculiar subject of calumny; no man, might
</p>
<p>he let the bitter cup pass from him without self-reproach,,
</p>
<p>would drain it to the bottom ; but if he has no choice in
</p>
<p>the case, if there is no alternative presented to him but
</p>
<p>a dereliction of duty or the opprobrium of those who are!
</p>
<p>denominated the world, he merits the contempt as wellj
</p>
<p>as the indignation of his country who can hesitate which
</p>
<p>to embrace.&quot;
</p>
<p>After this simple defiance, Marshall in this, his
</p>
<p>longest opinion, which required three hours for the
</p>
<p>reading, reviewed the case in all its phases, examining

<p>Burr s Trial, ii., 441.
</p>
<p>350 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>elaborately the chief arguments of the counsel, with
</p>
<p>many citations from authorities. The paragraph which
</p>
<p>struck the earth from under the feet of the prosecution
</p>
<p>read as follows :*
</p>
<p>&quot;The present indictment charges the prisoner with
</p>
<p>levying war against the United States, and alleges an
</p>
<p>overt act of levying war. That overt act must be proved,
</p>
<p>according to the mandates of the Constitution and of the
</p>
<p>act of Congress, by two witnesses. It is not proved by a
</p>
<p>single witness. . . . The conclusion, that in this state
</p>
<p>of things no testimony can be admissible, is so inevitable
</p>
<p>that the counsel for the United States could not resist it.
</p>
<p>j I do not understand them to deny that, if the overt act
</p>
<p>| be not proved by two witnesses so as to be submitted to
</p>
<p>the jury, all other testimony must be irrelevant; because
</p>
<p>no other testimony can prove the act. . . . No testi
</p>
<p>mony relative to the conduct or declarations of the
</p>
<p>prisoner elsewhere and subsequent to the transaction on
</p>
<p>Blennerhassett s island can be admitted ; because such
</p>
<p>testimony, being in its nature merely corroborative and
</p>
<p>incompetent to prove the overt act in itself, is irrelevant
</p>
<p>until there be proof of the overt act by two witnesses.&quot;
</p>
<p>To that argument there was no rejoinder. The
</p>
<p>next day, September i st, the case was abandoned by the
</p>
<p>Government and the jury returned a verdict of &quot;Not
</p>
<p>guilty.&quot; Burr had at last escaped ; but not, as we often
</p>
<p>find it stated, on a technicality. McMaster and others
</p>
<p>have said that he owed his deliverance to absence from
</p>
<p>Blennerhassett s island at the time the overt act was
</p>
<p>committed. The statement is fundamentally erroneous.
</p>
<p>Primarily considered. Burr was acquitted because no
</p>
<p>overt act of levying war could be shown to have taken
</p>
<p>place. The overt act once established, Burr could have

<p>&quot;Burr s Trial, ii., 441.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL AT RICHMOND 351
</p>
<p>been tried only after the conviction of Blennerhassett
</p>
<p>or of some one of those implicated in the act of war as
</p>
<p>specified in the indictment. On this point the court
</p>
<p>held:
</p>
<p>&quot;The legal guilt of the person who planned the assem
</p>
<p>blage on Blennerhassett s island depends not simply on
</p>
<p>the criminality of the previous conspiracy, but on the
</p>
<p>criminality of that assemblage. If those who perpetrated
</p>
<p>the fact be not traitors, he who advised the fact cannot be
</p>
<p>a traitor. . . . The whole reason of the law then
</p>
<p>relative to the principal and accessory, so far as respects
</p>
<p>the order of trial, seems to apply in full force to a case of
</p>
<p>treason committed by one body of men in conspiracy with
</p>
<p>others who are absent.&quot;
</p>
<p>Burr had therefore effected a double escape both
</p>
<p>positions of the defense had been upheld. Henceforth
</p>
<p>for America, treason against the State must consist of
</p>
<p>acts ; the spirit of the Constitution opposed constructive
</p>
<p>treason; the spirit of the mass of Americans whose
</p>
<p>aims and struggles had made a Constitution pos
</p>
<p>sible was irrevocably against the Old World system
</p>
<p>which brought one s head so easily to the block. That
</p>
<p>Jefferson should have gone into a violent passion at
</p>
<p>Marshall s dictum must have astonished those who
</p>
<p>claimed to adhere to Republican principles, who still
</p>
<p>recalled the terrors of the Alien and Sedition laws and
</p>
<p>the tyrannies of the party responsible for them. That
</p>
<p>it was a decision in favor of the individual as against
</p>
<p>government none could question. One thing was
</p>
<p>obvious ; the political axiom of the President, that the
</p>
<p>world was too much governed, had faded from his

</p>
<p>352 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>seems never to have realized the change, nor that the
</p>
<p>business of politics was one thing, and speculation on
</p>
<p>politics quite another.
</p>
<p>The news of the acquittal of Burr sounded dismal
</p>
<p>enough in the ears of two men : Jefferson, who had
</p>
<p>superintended the gathering of the evidence, who had
</p>
<p>in part directed the prosecution, and whose reputation
</p>
<p>for sound judgment and upright principles, he seemed
</p>
<p>to think, depended on a conviction, since he had un
</p>
<p>qualifiedly assumed the guilt of Burr and Wilkin
</p>
<p>son, who had pursued the conspirators with a venom
</p>
<p>born of his own corruption. It is not surprising, there
</p>
<p>fore, that they condoled with one another over the
</p>
<p>result.
</p>
<p>&quot;I know little of law and less of judiciary proceed
</p>
<p>ings,&quot; the General said to his protector, 1 &quot;but common
</p>
<p>sense suggests that he has been hastily acquitted under
</p>
<p>certain refinements and subtilties of sentiment opposed to
</p>
<p>the claims of justice and apparently calculated to extin
</p>
<p>guish enquiry, to suppress truth, to prostitute the trial by
</p>
<p>jury, to render the court a dead letter, and to conceal the
</p>
<p>crimes of a traitor.&quot;
</p>
<p>A week later the President answered, in a passion
</p>
<p>which had almost consumed itself : 2
</p>
<p>&quot;The scenes which have been acted at Richmond are
</p>
<p>such as have never before been exhibited in any country,
</p>
<p>where all regard to public character has not yet been
</p>
<p>thrown off. They are equivalent to a proclamation of im
</p>
<p>punity to every traitorous combination which may be
</p>
<p>formed to destroy the Union.&quot;

<p>THE TRIAL AT RICHMOND 353
</p>
<p>The district-attorney also reported the news of the
</p>
<p>acquittal to headquarters, taking care to criticise Mar
</p>
<p>shall, relating also that Wirt, who had all along &quot;ad
</p>
<p>vocated the integrity of the Chief- Justice,&quot; now aban
</p>
<p>doned him. September 4th, in a passionate outburst,
</p>
<p>Jefferson replied i 1
</p>
<p>&quot;The event has been what was evidently intended from
</p>
<p>the beginning of the trial, that is to say, not only to clear
</p>
<p>Burr, but to prevent the evidence from ever going before
</p>
<p>the world. But this latter case must not take place. It
</p>
<p>is now, therefore, more than ever indispensable that not a
</p>
<p>single witness be paid or permitted to depart until his
</p>
<p>testimony has been committed to writing. . . . These
</p>
<p>whole proceedings will be laid before Congress that they
</p>
<p>may decide, whether the defect has been in the evidence
</p>
<p>of guilt, or in the law, or in the application of the law.
</p>
<p>. . . This criminal is preserved to become the rallying
</p>
<p>point of all the disaffected and worthless of the United
</p>
<p>States, and to be the point on which all the intrigues and
</p>
<p>the conspiracies which foreign Governments may wish to
</p>
<p>disturb us with are to turn. If he is convicted of the mis
</p>
<p>demeanor, the judge must in decency give us respite by
</p>
<p>some short confinement of him ; but we must expect it to
</p>
<p>be very short.&quot;
</p>
<p>It was now resolved that Congress should investi
</p>
<p>gate the affair. If impeachment was found to be the
</p>
<p>remedy, that should be invoked; if a constitutional
</p>
<p>amendment concerning the judiciary were deemed
</p>
<p>expedient, then that should be proposed. Already
</p>
<p>Jefferson had said in a letter to Rodney, &quot;It is im
</p>
<p>possible Congress should not take up that subject.&quot;
</p>
<p>And October ist he asked of Hay that the evidence be
</p>
<p>speedily sent in, so that it might be prepared against

</p>
<p>the sitting of that body. 1 The matter was sent in; but
</p>
<p>the meditated struggle was somewhere forestalled ; and
</p>
<p>it was well that it was so, for Wilkinson, the main
</p>
<p>reliance of the Government, was to be deserted even by
</p>
<p>Hay, who, in a letter to the President at the close of
</p>
<p>the trial, said frankly : 2
</p>
<p>&quot;The declaration which I made in court in his [Wilkin
</p>
<p>son s] favor some time ago was precipitate; and though
</p>
<p>I have not retracted it, everybody sees that I have not
</p>
<p>attempted the task which I in fact promised to perform.
</p>
<p>My confidence in him is shaken, if not destroyed. I am
</p>
<p>sorry for it, on his own account, on the public account,
</p>
<p>; and because you have expressed opinions in his favor ; but
</p>
<p>you did not know then what you will soon know, and what
</p>
<p>I did not learn until after long after my declaration
</p>
<p>above mentioned.&quot;
</p>
<p>A week after the verdict in the treason case, while
</p>
<p>it was still uncertain what the next move should be, the
</p>
<p>President sent Hay the following advice : 3
</p>
<p>&quot;I am happy in having the benefit of Mr. Madison s
</p>
<p>counsel on this occasion. He happens to be now with
</p>
<p>me. We are both strongly of opinion that the prosecution
</p>
<p>against Burr for misdemeanor should proceed at Rich
</p>
<p>mond. If debated, it will heap coals of fire on the head
</p>
<p>of the judge ; if convicted, it will give time to see whether
</p>
<p>a prosecution for treason against him can be instituted
</p>
<p>in any and what other court. But we are inclined to
</p>
<p>think it may be best to send Blennerhassett and Smith
</p>
<p>(Israel) to Kentucky to be tried both for treason and
</p>
<p>misdemeanor. The trial of Dayton for misdemeanor may
</p>
<p>as well go on at Richmond.&quot;

</p>
<p>THE TRIAL AT RICHMOND 355
</p>
<p>Already the skirmishing had begun. For a few
</p>
<p>days Hay thought of sending the prisoner to Kentucky
</p>
<p>for trial on the treason charge. After a week s debate
</p>
<p>during which time the matter of obtaining Wilkinson s
</p>
<p>letters of October 2ist and November i2th from the
</p>
<p>President was revived with mutual recriminations
</p>
<p>the court decided that the indictment for misdemeanor
</p>
<p>must be disposed of before the question of Burr s com
</p>
<p>mitment for trial elsewhere could be entertained.
</p>
<p>The indictment for misdemeanor had been framed
</p>
<p>under the fifth section of the Act of Congress of June
</p>
<p>5, 1794, which provided that if any person shall, within
</p>
<p>the jurisdiction of the United States, begin or set on
</p>
<p>foot a military expedition against the territory of any
</p>
<p>foreign power with whom the United States are at
</p>
<p>peace, he shall be guilty of a high misdemeanor. Burr
</p>
<p>was charged with having begun such an enterprise
</p>
<p>against the dominions of the King of Spain, and here,
</p>
<p>indeed, it seemed as if he must be convicted. In order
</p>
<p>to escape the snare of treason it was almost necessary!
</p>
<p>to entangle himself in the meshes of a high mis
</p>
<p>demeanor. Blennerhassett feared, and with reason,
</p>
<p>that the prosecution would put Burr upon a defense on
</p>
<p>the treason bill which would &quot;nearly amount to a con
</p>
<p>fession of the misdemeanor.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;I think this has actually happened,&quot; he wrote August
</p>
<p>3Oth in his diary. 1 &quot;Martin thought that because Burr
</p>
<p>alleges he expected war between Spain and the United
</p>
<p>States, his expedition was lawful. But may not a jury
</p>
<p>think Burr did not expect the war, and find their verdict
</p>
<p>then on the confession?&quot;

</p>
<p>356 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>It is extremely unfortunate that the trial for treason
</p>
<p>was unseasonably cut short. That it would have been
</p>
<p>^far better for the sake of truth and history had it con-
</p>
<p>/tinued and Burr been compelled to examine his wit-
</p>
<p>&quot;^ nesses cannot be denied. The conspirators, however, had
</p>
<p>not only the indictment for treason to fear, but that of
</p>
<p>misdemeanor as well; they were, therefore, to borrow
</p>
<p>General Wilkinson s expression, between Scylla and
</p>
<p>Charybdis, and rejoiced to be in a position to defeat
</p>
<p>the indictments, having no qualms of conscience and
</p>
<p>taking no heed what interpretation the future might
</p>
<p>iput on their conduct. It would have been a spectacle
</p>
<p>of unusual interest, a dramatic climax, to have set Jack
</p>
<p>son against Wilkinson ; Adair against Eaton ; Harrison,
</p>
<p>Woodbridge, Truxton, and Alston against the Mor
</p>
<p>gans, Peter Taylor, and Allbright.
</p>
<p>It was not until September 9, 1807, that the jury in
</p>
<p>the misdemeanor case was sworn and the examination
</p>
<p>of witnesses begun. The prosecution submitted as evi
</p>
<p>dence certain declarations of Blennerhassett which tend
</p>
<p>ed to implicate the defendant; also acts of the nature
</p>
<p>laid in the indictment committed by Burr in Ohio and
</p>
<p>Kentucky, but not in Wood County, Virginia. Third
</p>
<p>parties who had no part or parcel in the undertaking
</p>
<p>told of the schemes of the sometime Vice-President
</p>
<p>of the United States. The specific counts in the indict
</p>
<p>ment seven in number were overlooked in the en
</p>
<p>deavor to exploit to an interested public more of
</p>
<p>the details of the conspiracy, and to &quot;heap coals of fire
</p>
<p>on the head of the judge.&quot; The defense finally ob

</p>
<p>jected to the introduction of such quantities of irrele-

</p>
<p>vant matter, and the court sustained the objection;
</p>
<p>ruling, however :
</p>
<p>&quot;That any legal testimony which shows the expedition
</p>
<p>to be military, or to have been designed against the do
</p>
<p>minions of Spain, may be received.
</p>
<p>&quot;That any testimony showing that the accused per
</p>
<p>formed within the district any one of the acts charged
</p>
<p>in the indictment may be received.&quot;
</p>
<p>This opinion was delivered September I4th, and the
</p>
<p>ensuing day the prosecution, having no testimony of
</p>
<p>the character described, gave up the case, and a verdict
</p>
<p>of &quot;Not guilty&quot; was rendered. Wilkinson immedi-
</p>
<p>alely sent a letter to the President bewailing the result,
</p>
<p>while, perhaps the same hour, Hay was renouncing his
</p>
<p>faith in the General.

</p>
<p>alarm. We supposed we possessed fixed laws to guard
</p>
<p>us equally against treason and oppression ; but it now
</p>
<p>appears we have no law but the will of the judge.&quot;
</p>
<p>Falling in with the train of accusation, the Attor
</p>
<p>ney-General declared to the President that the prosecu
</p>
<p>tion had done well, but that it could not hope to
</p>
<p>struggle against wind and tide. Therefore, he sug
</p>
<p>gested that Burr should be tried in Kentucky before a
</p>
<p>judge who had been appointed since the expulsion of
</p>
<p>the adventurers; in other words, before a court which
</p>
<p>would respond to Executive pressure. On the other
</p>
<p>hand, alluding to the people of Kentucky, Rodney
</p>
<p>declared that &quot;they had acted without any regard to
</p>
<p>decency,&quot; which was an ungrateful insult as well as a
</p>
<p>frank admission that Burr was beyond pursuit. 1
</p>
<p>Now, in effect, the charges against the conspirators
</p>
<p>were practically cancelled. Failing to convict Burr,
</p>
<p>nolle prosequi was entered against the names of his
</p>
<p>indicted associates. But Jefferson was not disposed to
</p>
<p>let the accused go in peace he still thought that his
</p>
<p>own reputation had to be vindicated before Congress
</p>
<p>/and the country. For even to laymen it might appear
</p>
<p>/ that he had pursued an ignis fatnus at great cost to the
</p>
<p>j Government ; that he had been over-credulous in believ
</p>
<p>ing and sustaining Wilkinson; or that his hatred of
</p>
<p>I Burr had inspired a prosecution as relentless as it had

<p>been unjust. If there was yet evidence which had not

<p>been exploited, no witness should be allowed to depart

</p>
<p>THE TRIAL AT RICHMOND 359
</p>
<p>was to be laid before Congress, and thenceforward
</p>
<p>preserved in the Annals of that body. But how could
</p>
<p>this be done under legal sanction?
</p>
<p>A clever manoeuvre by Hay gave the solution. By
</p>
<p>moving to send Burr first to Mississippi Territory for
</p>
<p>trial and then to Ohio, what evidence the Government
</p>
<p>possessed would be disclosed. All this was intended
</p>
<p>to contribute toward the overthrow of Marshall and his
</p>
<p>fellow judges. The President hoped, as has been noted,
</p>
<p>that the agitation would compel an amendment to the
</p>
<p>Constitution which would place the Federal Judiciary
</p>
<p>on the same basis with the other coordinate depart
</p>
<p>ments of government. If he failed in this, it was not
</p>
<p>for want of a mass of testimony concerning the nature
</p>
<p>of the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>It is impossible here to indicate even the chief steps
</p>
<p>in the further proceedings against the associates. The
</p>
<p>published testimony would fill a volume in itself. It
</p>
<p>is sufficient to say that the prosecution was now per
</p>
<p>mitted to produce their witnesses as they chose, nor was
</p>
<p>there any limit to the quality or quantity of their testi
</p>
<p>mony. It was only at this stage that General Wilkin
</p>
<p>son succeeded in rendering his complete version of the
</p>
<p>plot a labor of love which was soon to make its ap
</p>
<p>pearance in his Aaron Burr Conspiracy Exposed.
</p>
<p>At length the last witness for the prosecution was
</p>
<p>dismissed, and October 2Oth Chief- Justice Marshall de
</p>
<p>livered an opinion on the motion for commitment,
</p>
<p>which eliminated once more the charge of treason.

</p>
<p>nary decisions, &quot;this is observable. That which relates
</p>
<p>to treason indicates the general design, while that which
</p>
<p>relates to the misdemeanor points to the particular expe
</p>
<p>dition which was actually commenced. Weighing the
</p>
<p>whole of this testimony, it appears to me to predominate
</p>
<p>in favor of the opinion that the enterprise was really
</p>
<p>designed against Mexico. . . . It is also a circum
</p>
<p>stance of considerable weight with me that the proof ex
</p>
<p>hibited by the United States to establish a general design
</p>
<p>to dismember the Union, applies only to Colonel Burr and
</p>
<p>Mr. Blennerhassett. It is not proved to have been ever
</p>
<p>communicated even to Tyler and Floyd. There is not only
</p>
<p>a failure to prove that such a design was communicated to
</p>
<p>or undertaken by the men who were assembled at the
</p>
<p>mouth of Cumberland, but the contrary is in full evidence.
</p>
<p>The United States have adduced several witnesses belong
</p>
<p>ing to that assemblage who concur in declaring that they
</p>
<p>heard nothing, that they suspected nothing, hostile to the
</p>
<p>United States. This testimony cannot be disregarded, for
</p>
<p>it is uncontradicted, and is offered by the prosecution.
</p>
<p>How can this assemblage be said to have levied war
</p>
<p>against the United States ? . . . These men were not
</p>
<p>ready nor willing to strike, nor could their chief be ready
</p>
<p>to strike without them. . . . Believing, then, the
</p>
<p>weight of testimony to be in favor of the opinion that the
</p>
<p>real and direct object of the expedition was Mexico,
</p>
<p>. . . it would, in my judgment, be improper in me to
</p>
<p>commit the accused on the charge of treason. ... I
</p>
<p>shall commit Aaron Burr and Harman Blennerhassett, for
</p>
<p>preparing and providing the means for a military expedi

<p>tion against the territories of a foreign prince, with whom
</p>
<p>the United States were at peace.&quot;

<p>mind as to the nature of the conspiracy. If treason had
</p>
<p>been contemplated, Burr and Blennerhassett had kept
</p>
<p>I their secret well ; as for the hardy, adventurous follow
</p>
<p>ers of the revolutionist, the conquest, of Mexico alone
</p>
<p>had lured them on. As Cortez with a handful of war-
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL AT RICHMOND 361
</p>
<p>riors had brought the empire of the Aztecs to an end,
</p>
<p>so again, they thought, might that fabled land feel the
</p>
<p>tramp of armies and witness the expiring throes of
</p>
<p>another empire far more deserving of extinction than
</p>
<p>the first.
</p>
<p>There seems to be not the slightest doubt that
</p>
<p>Aaron Burr and his followers were all guilty of high
</p>
<p>misdemeanor that alone. Such an opinion has every
</p>
<p>thing to sustain it. That they escaped punishment in
</p>
<p>the end was due to a slight reaction in their favor and
</p>
<p>to the fact that society was palled with the subject of
</p>
<p>the conspiracy, while ever more persistent became the
</p>
<p>encroachments of the European powers. When the
</p>
<p>circuit court of Ohio convened at Chillicothe, January
</p>
<p>4, 1808, neither Burr nor Blennerhassett both under
</p>
<p>bond appeared. Once more indictments were re
</p>
<p>turned ; but with that the prosecutions of the filibusters
</p>
<p>were ended. However, the American nation had tried
</p>
<p>the case and, on the testimony of Jefferson, Eaton, and \
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, had passed judgment, not without dissent ),
</p>
<p>it is true, but the verdict of treason was irrevocable. \
</p>
<p>Henceforth, vituperation and persecution were to be
</p>
<p>meted out with a lavishness commensurate with the
</p>
<p>enormity of the crime. Although Jefferson was loath
</p>
<p>to abandon the prosecution, he realized the futility of
</p>
<p>his efforts to bring about a conviction, and so he let
</p>
<p>the matter rest. His hands were in truth full of much
</p>
<p>weightier affairs. War threatened with both England

<p>and Spain; a dangerous sflnsm was impending in the

<p>CHAPTER XIII.
</p>
<p>The Last Years.
</p>
<p>THE history of the Conspiracy would be incom
</p>
<p>plete without some further notice of Aaron
</p>
<p>Burr, without a later glimpse of the West. To
</p>
<p>have escaped the toils of the court in no wise cleared
</p>
<p>him of guilt in the eyes of the people who had heeded
</p>
<p>but one charge treason. The disastrous outcome of
</p>
<p>his plans, however, failed to dampen his ardor, and
</p>
<p>before the weary trial was over Burr had in view
</p>
<p>measures for their rehabilitation. He would set off
</p>
<p>for England as soon as liberated from court &quot;to collect
</p>
<p>money for reorganizing his projects.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>&quot;I visited Burr this morning,&quot; wrote Blennerhassett,
</p>
<p>September I3th, in his prison at Richmond; &quot;he is as gay
</p>
<p>as usual, and as busy in speculations on reorganizing his
</p>
<p>projects for action as if he had never suffered the least
</p>
<p>interruption. He observed to Major Smith and me, that P
</p>
<p>in six months our schemes could be all remounted.&quot; 2
</p>
<p>When Burr sailed incognito for England two things
</p>
<p>were uppermost in his mind relief from persecution
</p>
<p>and aid for his designs. Unfortunately, upon his land
</p>
<p>ing in Great Britain, the war with Spain had resolved
</p>
<p>itself into friendship, and all idea of freeing the Span
</p>
<p>ish colonies was swallowed up in the enthusiasm with
</p>
<p>which the English nation applauded the uprising of
</p>
<p>Spain against Napoleon. Burr fell at once under the

<p>suspicion of the Government, and tried in vain to get
</p>
<p>propositions before the Ministry. His hopes were
</p>
<p>finally dissipated by the receipt of a letter from An
</p>
<p>thony Merry, who had again come upon the scene of
</p>
<p>his intrigues. November 6, 1808, was the date of the
</p>
<p>note :
</p>
<p>&quot;Although I could not see Mr. Canning yesterday, from
</p>
<p>his being gone into the country, to stay till Tuesday morn
</p>
<p>ing, for the recovery of his health, I conversed with an
</p>
<p>other person of nearly equal authority, who told me he
</p>
<p>was sure that what you proposed to me yesterday could
</p>
<p>never be consented to, pointing it out in every way to be
</p>
<p>impracticable.&quot;
</p>
<p>What Burr s propositions were we shall most likely
</p>
<p>never know. Davis, the biographer, says that Burr
</p>
<p>i thought &quot;the political situation of Europe offered op-
</p>
<p>/ portunities for accomplishing the object he had long
</p>
<p>contemplated, of emancipating the Spanish-American ,
</p>
<p>colonies from the degrading tyranny of Spain.&quot; 2
</p>
<p>Being expelled .from England, Burr crossed to the
</p>
<p>Continent in the hope that he might fall in with some
</p>
<p>of Napoleon s plans for the disposition of the Spanish
</p>
<p>colonial possessions. In a memorial to Bonaparte he
</p>
<p>set forth the views which had brought him to
</p>
<p>France : 3
</p>
<p>&quot;While in Germany last winter I saw in the Moniteur
</p>
<p>an expression of your Majesty s assent to the independ

</p>
<p>my views, and asking a passport if those views should be
</p>
<p>deemed worthy of your Majesty s attention. A passport
</p>
<p>was transmitted to me. On the day of my arrival in
</p>
<p>Paris I announced myself to the Due de Cadore, and on
</p>
<p>the day following had an audience, in which I explained,
</p>
<p>as fully as the time would admit, the nature of my pro
</p>
<p>jects and the means of execution.&quot;
</p>
<p>However, before Burr had reached the soil of
</p>
<p>France he was looked upon with suspicion. This was
</p>
<p>occasioned in part by the action of Jonathan Russell,
</p>
<p>charge d affaires of the United States at Paris, and
</p>
<p>McRae, the consul. Even had this not been the case
</p>
<p>he must have failed; Napoleon s inclination or desire
</p>
<p>could not have been carried out had he so chosen; the
</p>
<p>political status put an expedition to the Spanish Amer
</p>
<p>icas out of the question. After repeated insults Burr
</p>
<p>saw the futility of hoping to gain the ear of the arbiter \
</p>
<p>of Europe, and at last disheartened he planned for his !
</p>
<p>return; but even a passport was denied him. Suffering &quot;
</p>
<p>great privations, he plead in vain for the intercession
</p>
<p>of our representatives, Russell and McRae, who scorned
</p>
<p>him as a criminal.
</p>
<p>At the end of four years, having endured humilia- ps
</p>
<p>tions and persecutions enough to have broken the spirit
</p>
<p>of any man, Aaron Burr returned to the United States.
</p>
<p>He had accomplished nothing, but already for two
</p>
<p>years the war he had hoped to lead had been raging in
</p>
<p>the Spanish colonies.

</p>
<p>no longer disputed characteristics of the frontiersmen ;
</p>
<p>nor was their malignant hatred of Spain doubted.
</p>
<p>Moreover, the same adventurous spirit that Burr had
</p>
<p>enlisted survived and was to manifest itself for suc
</p>
<p>ceeding decades in filibustering enterprises, moving
</p>
<p>ever westward tidal waves of society beating down
</p>
<p>the barriers of an opposing civilization. By the sum
</p>
<p>mer of 1808 the Neutral Ground was filled with adven
</p>
<p>turers, who crossed the Sabine, bartered with the na
</p>
<p>tives, caught wild horses, and gave Nemecio de Salcedo
</p>
<p>no end of trouble. They were recognized as Burr s
</p>
<p>legitimate successors. June 22, 1808, Louis de Clovet,
</p>
<p>consul for Spain in New Orleans, wrote Salcedo,
</p>
<p>&quot;From what I can hear and penetrate it seems that
</p>
<p>the project of Burr is coming to life.&quot; 1 And Manuel
</p>
<p>de Salcedo, Governor of Texas, after a visit to Natchez,
</p>
<p>reported :
</p>
<p>&quot;The partisans of Colonel Burr insist on their designs
</p>
<p>against the Internal Provinces of Mexico. . . . They

<p>are to float down the Ohio and Mississippi in flatboats

<p>some will ascend the Arkansas and move on New Mexico ;
</p>
<p>others will cross Texas. . . . Some of them are
</p>
<p>actually on the Washita lands, while there are many in
</p>
<p>Natchez who entertain suspicious projects.&quot; 1
</p>
<p>A few days later Captain-General Salcedo confessed
</p>
<p>to the Viceroy that he feared for his provinces because

<p>of the restless, grasping, envious disposition of the

<p>to note that General Wilkinson was jubilant over the

<p>prospect of the rebellion of the Spanish colonies. Octo

<p>ber i, 1808, he sent to Jefferson the following: 1
</p>
<p>&quot;The scenes which are now passing before us in rapid
</p>
<p>succession inspire the liveliest hopes that the emancipation
</p>
<p>of Mexico and South America is not distant; and they
</p>
<p>excite in my breast the strongest solicitude to participate
</p>
<p>in the glorious achievement in which the United States
</p>
<p>and all Spanish-America appear to be mutually and pro
</p>
<p>foundly interested.&quot;
</p>
<p>It is a matter of no little moment to find that revolu
</p>
<p>tions broke out in West Florida, Mexico, Granada, and
</p>
<p>Caracas during the month of September, 1810. The
</p>
<p>Governor of Texas wrote to the Viceroy 2 that they
</p>
<p>had the same origin and the same end; and with re

<p>gard to the rebellion in Baton Rouge, he remarked ^
</p>
<p>that it had its extension throughout Louisiana, and/
</p>
<p>that it was not a combination of a day, but that it had! ^f
</p>
<p>been urged since the beginning of the Conspiracy ofj^

<p>Aaron Burr. 3
</p>
<p>It would be fruitless to continue the narrative to

<p>show how full the &quot;stream of tendency&quot; ran during the

<p>next half century. It is quite sufficient that we should

<p>proved so dear a friend to him and who had endeavored
</p>
<p>to reconcile him to Miranda concerning the South
</p>
<p>American patriot i 1
</p>
<p>&quot;There is a possibility, perhaps something more, that
</p>
<p>I may mingle, personally, in the affairs of Spanish Amer
</p>
<p>ica. In such a case, a good understanding would be of
</p>
<p>sound policy, perhaps of mutual necessity. It is also
</p>
<p>probable that I may be capable of rendering him [Mi
</p>
<p>randa] or his countrymen service in the United States,
</p>
<p>whither I am now about to return, and certainly I should
</p>
<p>do it with pleasure and with zeal.&quot;
</p>
<p>Almost the first news he had upon landing in New
</p>
<p>York was that his only grandchild, Aaron Burr Alston,
</p>
<p>was dead. This blighting intelligence was soon after
</p>
<p>ward eclipsed by the loss of Theodosia. who, sailing
</p>
<p>from Charleston to meet her father in New York, was
</p>
<p>never heard from again. Burr s life was thenceforward
</p>
<p>a hopeless blank. The only subject which aroused his
</p>
<p>enthusiasm was the emancipation of the Spanish col
</p>
<p>onies. He encouraged those who were struggling for
</p>
<p>the consummation of such hopes, and in the end be
</p>
<p>came known to the leaders of the revolt. In 1816 Jose
</p>
<p>Alvarez de Toledo, one of the distinguished soldiers of
</p>
<p>Mexico, wrote: &quot;Although I have not the honor of
</p>
<p>knowing you personally, the reputation of your talents

<p>and good wishes for the cause of America have made

<p>THE LAST YEARS 369
</p>
<p>your name familiar among us.&quot; * Then Burr was in
</p>
<p>vited to assume the &quot;management&quot; of the &quot;political and
</p>
<p>military affairs&quot; of Mexico. But already the weight
</p>
<p>of years and the burden of sorrow which bore upon
</p>
<p>him were bowing him to the earth the invitation
</p>
<p>could only be declined. Some years later when the
</p>
<p>Texans began their struggle for independence Burr
</p>
<p>manifested an intense interest in the result. One day,
</p>
<p>upon reading some account from that quarter, he ex
</p>
<p>claimed, &quot;There! you see? I was right! I was only
</p>
<p>thirty years too soon. What was treason in me thirty
</p>
<p>years ago, is patriotism now !&quot; 2
</p>
<p>In the early part of June, 1836, it was thought Burr
</p>
<p>was dying, and the question was asked him, &quot;Whether
</p>
<p>in the expedition to the Southwest he had designed a
</p>
<p>separation of the Union.&quot; The reply was, &quot;No; I
</p>
<p>would as soon have thought of taking possession of
</p>
<p>the moon, and informing my friends that I intended
</p>
<p>to divide it among them.&quot; 3
</p>
<p>September 14, 1836, Aaron Burr ceased to live, and
</p>
<p>a few days later all that was mortal of him was con
</p>
<p>signed to a grave near his father s resting place in the
</p>
<p>beautiful cemetery at Princeton his life and career
</p>
<p>were merged in the stream of history.
