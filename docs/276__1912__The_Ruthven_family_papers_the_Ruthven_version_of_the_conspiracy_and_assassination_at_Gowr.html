<p>AUTHOR'S PREFACE
</p>
<p>Historical events affecting Scottish history, or
</p>
<p>indeed any history, and occurring so far back as
</p>
<p>1600, or fully three centuries ago, are rarely called
</p>
<p>in question even by students of history, nor is it
</p>
<p>desirable to encourage what would challenge the
</p>
<p>accuracy and integrity of the generally accepted
</p>
<p>historical record, unless the material so produced
</p>
<p>were beyond doubt and unchallengeable. In that
</p>
<p>notable and momentous event, the so-called Gowrie
</p>
<p>Conspiracy, of which we have now unquestionable
</p>
<p>proof, there has always been mystery surrounding
</p>
<p>it, evidently founded on the refusal of the Scottish
</p>
<p>Clergy and Magistrates of Perth, and the majority
</p>
<p>of the Scottish people of that period, to recognise
</p>
<p>it as a conspiracy of the Ruthvens, and the Clergy's
</p>
<p>refusal to pray for the King's deliverance; believ-
</p>
<p>ing, as many of them did, that the King was
</p>
<p>himself the author of the plot. It is a notorious
</p>
<p>fact that it is the King's version of the plot, and no
</p>
<p>other version, that has been before the public these
</p>
<p>three hundred years, notwithstanding there are
</p>
<p>historians who have pointed out that no narrative
</p>
<p>by the Ruthven family has ever been forthcoming.

<p>AUTHORS PREFACE
</p>
<p>That point is now set at rest by the issue of this
</p>
<p>volume.
</p>
<p>It now appears that a Ruthven narrative has been
</p>
<p>written by the Ruthven family, or at least by a bona
</p>
<p>fide member of it. On a careful inspection recently
</p>
<p>of the Ruthven Family Papers, at the request of
</p>
<p>Lord Ruthven, we have discovered this document;
</p>
<p>a paper of historical value, in respect that it con-
</p>
<p>firms the views of the Scottish Clergy and Magis-
</p>
<p>trates of Perth of 1600, that the King, and not
</p>
<p>Cowrie, was the conspirator, and stamps the King
</p>
<p>and his six nobles, amongst whom were divided the
</p>
<p>illegally confiscated Cowrie estates, as the sole con-
</p>
<p>spirators, enterprisers, and negotiators of the plot,
</p>
<p>and alone responsible for the consequences of that
</p>
<p>catastrophe with all its brutalities, cruelties and
</p>
<p>persecutions.
</p>
<p>The narrative from the Ruthven charter chest
</p>
<p>ought to have been published long ago, but though
</p>
<p>late in the day in reaching publication it will be
</p>
<p>regarded by all unprejudiced readers as of supreme
</p>
<p>importance. The Scottish Parliament of that period
</p>
<p>was evidently not an impartial tribunal. The
</p>
<p>political circumstances of the time rendered im-
</p>
<p>partiality impossible, and the reader is referred for
</p>
<p>information on this point to the narrative of the
</p>
<p>Privy Council Register on pages   In such
</p>
<p>turbulent times impartiality could not be expected,

</p>
<p>and the Ruthven family, by means of a fraudulent
</p>
<p>and an utterly mysterious and unexpected con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, were driven from their estates and homes,
</p>
<p>the heads of the family slain, the dead bodies out-
</p>
<p>raged, and the Gowrie estates divided among the
</p>
<p>six satellites of the King who committed the in-
</p>
<p>famous deed. It now turns out that all this was
</p>
<p>done at the instigation of James VI., was homolo-
</p>
<p>gated by the Scottish Parliament without adequate
</p>
<p>reason, and it is to be regretted that the Acts of this
</p>
<p>Parliament and the official records of the time, are
</p>
<p>simply full, ad nauseam, of this piece of wholesale
</p>
<p>butchery, falsely called " Gowrie Conspiracy."
</p>
<p>The reader may well ask what can be the ex-
</p>
<p>planation of all this, and we can do nothing but
</p>
<p>refer him for answer to the following pages. The
</p>
<p>Ruthven family of to-day recognise with pride that
</p>
<p>many of their distinguished ancestors were promi-
</p>
<p>nent men on the political platform of the Ancient
</p>
<p>Kingdom of Scotland, at a trying period of Scottish
</p>
<p>history ; and, notwithstanding their persecution
</p>
<p>and supposed extinction, the Freeland branch of the
</p>
<p>family, represented to-day by Lord Ruthven, and,
</p>
<p>as will be seen from the Kalendar, many of its
</p>
<p>members, rose to an eminent position in the
</p>
<p>government and administration of the king-
</p>
<p>dom.

</p>
<p>supporter of King James III., and provided his
</p>
<p>sovereign with 3000 men at the battle of Sauchie-
</p>
<p>burn, where the King lost his life. The Master of
</p>
<p>Ruthven, son of this Lord Ruthven, fell, sword in
</p>
<p>hand, at the battle of Flodden, in 1513; and down
</p>
<p>to the catastrophe of 1600 the heads of the House of
</p>
<p>Ruthven, in the administration of the kingdom,
</p>
<p>occupied a position that was supreme ; but, while
</p>
<p>saying so, we are not to be understood as endorsing
</p>
<p>all the political acts of Patrick, Lord Ruthven, and
</p>
<p>his son William, first Earl of Gowrie, who were
</p>
<p>men to be reckoned with in the reign of Queen
</p>
<p>Mary. Lord William was for a limited period Lord
</p>
<p>Treasurer of Scotland, and was the champion who
</p>
<p>conceived and carried out the Raid of Ruthven and
</p>
<p>capture of the boy king. A noble Scottish family
</p>
<p>was the Ruthvens, of whom the nation had reason
</p>
<p>to be proud ; but, alas ! who can resist the inevit-
</p>
<p>able, or fight with the vicissitudes of fortune; and
</p>
<p>so the elder branch of this ancient and venerable
</p>
<p>family, so long identified with Scotland's imperial
</p>
<p>administration, passed in 1600 into the realm of
</p>
<p>history.
</p>
<p>All the branches have representatives alive at this
</p>
<p>date, while the family name of Ruthven has long
</p>
<p>since been restored, and the fraudulent and illegal
</p>
<p>attainder cancelled by the Parliament of Charles L
</p>
<p>in 1641. This important Act of Parliament will

<p>be found in the text, as well as other Acts of the
</p>
<p>Scottish Parliament relating to the Ruthvens.
</p>
<p>The volume concludes with a short biography of
</p>
<p>John, third Earl of Gowrie, and a family history of
</p>
<p>the Ruthvens, extracted from the family papers.
</p>
<p>The family can trace their origin to a very early
</p>
<p>date, and appear to have been identified so far back
</p>
<p>as the twelfth century with the parish of Tibbermore
</p>
<p>in Perthshire, as extensive territorial landowners.
</p>
<p>From the chartulary of Scone (Liber ecclesicB de
</p>
<p>Scon) we have reproduced the only charters re-
</p>
<p>corded there relating to the Ruthven family.
</p>
<p>The author acknowledges with thanks the sub-
</p>
<p>stantial help he has received in the production of
</p>
<p>this volume from a member of the Ruthven Family,

<p>THE RUTHVEN FAMILY PAPERS
</p>
<p>Thor, a nobleman believed to be of Saxon or
</p>
<p>Danish origin, lived in Scotland in the reign of
</p>
<p>David I., and probably that of Malcolm IV. It is
</p>
<p>generally understood that he obtained from Earl
</p>
<p>Henry, King David's son, a grant of land for
</p>
<p>Swaine, son of Thor, as he gratefully commemor-
</p>
<p>ates the Earl in the charter to the monks of Scone.
</p>
<p>Swaine, Son of Thor, lived long under William
</p>
<p>the Lion, and enjoyed the manors of Ruthven and
</p>
<p>Tibbermuir, as well as other lands in Perthshire.
</p>
<p>He gave the monks of Inchcolm a toft in Tibber-
</p>
<p>muir and a meadow at Methven, which were con-
</p>
<p>firmed by King William, and by his grandson,
</p>
<p>Walter, son of Alan, and, in 1362, by his kins-
</p>
<p>man and descendant, William de Ruthven.
</p>
<p>He also possessed, as Superior Lord, the lands of
</p>
<p>Crawford in upper Clydesdale, which the progeni-
</p>
<p>tor of the Lindsays held as vassals under him,
</p>
<p>as appears from a confirmation by King William
</p>
<p>of a donation to the monastery of Newbattle by
</p>
<p>William de Lindsay, part of the lands of Crawford
</p>
<p>which William himself holds of Swaine, son of
</p>
<p>Thor.
</p>
<p>Alan (i 177-1204) is recorded as having been
</p>
<p>married to Eva, daughter of Swaine, son of Thor,
</p>
<p>Lord of Tibbermore. His second wife was
</p>
<p>Alcestor, daughter of Morgund, fifth Earl of Mar.
</p>

<p>Walter and David. Alan died in 1204, and was
</p>
<p>interred before the High Altar in Paisley Abbey.
</p>
<p>This was in the fortieth year of the reign of William
</p>
<p>the Lion. Alan, son-in-law of Swaine, confirmed
</p>
<p>his father's donations to this religious community
</p>
<p>in the beginning of the reign of Alexander II., was
</p>
<p>twice designed Alanus filius Swaine. He left two
</p>
<p>sons, Walter and David. He was succeeded by
</p>
<p>his eldest son, Walter, who it is believed is desig-
</p>
<p>nated in charters of that period " Walter of
</p>
<p>Ruthven," being the first of the family to assume
</p>
<p>a surname. This Walter of Ruthven became
</p>
<p>known as Sir Walter Ruthven, and was the earliest
</p>
<p>ancestor of the Ruthven family. He took his sur-
</p>
<p>name from his lands and possessions, and in official
</p>
<p>documents is designated Walter de Ruthven, son
</p>
<p>of Alan, who was son-in-law of Swaine, son of
</p>
<p>Thor, Lord of Tibbermore. Sir Walter was there-
</p>
<p>fore grandson of Swaine. He married Cecilia,
</p>
<p>daughter of Gilbert, Earl of Strathearn.
</p>
<p>Walter witnessed a donation of Gilbert, Earl of

</p>
<p>With his wife Cecilia, daughter of the Earl of
</p>
<p>Strathearn, he got the lands of Cowgask and others,
</p>
<p>in these words : Walterus filicia Alani uxoriam
</p>
<p>juxta Cecilia filius Gilbertis, Comites de Strath-
</p>
<p>earn. Walter thus confirmed the donations which
</p>
<p>Swaine, son of Thor, his grandfather, gave to
</p>
<p>Tibbermuir, to which Gilbert, Earl of Strathearn,
</p>
<p>and his son, Robert, are witnesses.
</p>
<p>Sir Walter was witness to the controversy with
</p>
<p>Galfrid, Bishop of Dunblane, in 1239.
</p>
<p>Sir William Ruthven confirmed the donations of
</p>
<p>his predecessor in 1260, and is witness to two dona-
</p>
<p>tions to the Priory of St Andrews, 1267 : William
</p>
<p>de Ruthven dominus ejus confirmassie carta domini
</p>
<p>Walterus filii Alani bona me^noria patris mei deo et
</p>
<p>Cononecus de Scone, 1260. Sir William left two
</p>
<p>sons, Walter and Gilbert.
</p>
<p>The fortalice, Ruthven Castle, with the chapels
</p>
<p>of Ruthven Castle and Tibbermore, dedicated, the
</p>
<p>former to St Peter and the latter to the Blessed
</p>
<p>Virgin Mary, would be foundations of this great
</p>
<p>territorial landlord, Thor, Lord of Tibbermore.
</p>
<p>He was owner of these chapels, and made
</p>
<p>a charter of donation to the monks of Scone
</p>
<p>during his lifetime. The charter was confirmed by
</p>
<p>Walter, who probably married, secondly, Marjory,
</p>
<p>daughter of Henry, Prince of Scotland, sister to
</p>
<p>Malcolm IV. and William the Lion, but this re-

</p>
<p>THE RUTHVEN FAMILY PAPERS
</p>
<p>quires confirmation. Almost the only thing recorded
</p>
<p>of Thor, is his charter of the lands of Ednaham, of
</p>
<p>which he was proprietor, to David, Earl of Hunt-
</p>
<p>ingdon, afterwards David I., dated between 1107
</p>
<p>and 1 1 17. This account of the origin of the
</p>
<p>Ruthven family is rather different from that of the
</p>
<p>new Peerage (Balfour Paul), which we now proceed
</p>
<p>to give in extenso. We cannot verify the one or
</p>
<p>the other, as there are neither official records nor
</p>
<p>family papers, of that earl}^ or prehistoric period, to
</p>
<p>draw upon. There can be no doubt that Sir Walter
</p>
<p>Ruthven, the first to assume a surname, was the
</p>
<p>ancestor of the Ruthvens. That point, which may
</p>
<p>be regarded as settled, is of supreme importance,
</p>
<p>as other and highly erroneous versions have been
</p>
<p>put before us.
</p>
<p>During the administration of Alan we have pre-
</p>
<p>served a very ancient paper, a charter of the gift of
</p>
<p>Ednaham, by Thor, Lord of Tibbermore. The
</p>
<p>text of the charter is as follows :  " To his dearest
</p>
<p>Lord, David the Earl (of Huntingdon) Thor
</p>
<p>entirely his, wisheth health. Know my Lord that
</p>
<p>King Edgar, your brother, gave to me Ednaham,
</p>
<p>waste, which I by his assistance, and my own
</p>
<p>money, have inhabited and have built from the
</p>
<p>foundation the Chapel, which your brother the
</p>
<p>King caused to be dedicated in honour of St
</p>
<p>Cuthbert and enlivened with one calvegh of land.

<p>Swaine, to the Abbey of Scone, conveying that

<p>ing to its marches  viz. in the King's Well, in the
</p>
<p>street which comes from Perth and leads to the
</p>
<p>village of Tibbermore. This well is two miles from
</p>
<p>Perth. This is the earliest Ruthven charter known
</p>
<p>to exist, and its author, Sir Walter Ruthven,
</p>
<p>grandson of Swaine, is the earliest ancestor of the
</p>
<p>noble family of Ruthven. It is said, but not con-

<p>firmed, that Walter was born in 1173.

</p>
<p>It is believed that Thor, Lord of Tibbermore, was
</p>
<p>founder of this family. Swaine, son of Thor,
</p>
<p>settled in Perthshire and granted between 1188 and
</p>
<p>1 199 to the monks of Scone certain lands in that
</p>
<p>county, of some limits, as also a toft at Tibbermore.
</p>
<p>The charter was confirmed by King William, by
</p>
<p>Swaine*s grandson, Walter, son of Alan, and by
</p>
<p>William de Ruthven. Swaine was also superior of
</p>
<p>the lands of Crawford in Lanarkshire, and he wit-

<p>nessed a charter of Malcolm IV. between 1163 and

</p>
<p>children, Walter, Henry and Alan. Walter, son of
</p>
<p>this Alan, granted a charter to the monks of Scone
</p>
<p>before 1223, and received a charter of Culgask
</p>
<p>(Cowgask) from his brother-in-law, Robert, Earl
</p>
<p>of Strathearn, between 1223 and 1231, as Walter,
</p>
<p>son of Alan, of Ruthven. He was witness to a
</p>
<p>charter about 1234, and a little later he is designated
</p>
<p>Walter of Ruthven. In 1245 Sir Walter of
</p>
<p>Ruthven was apparently the first of his family to
</p>
<p>assume that surname. He married Cecilia,
</p>
<p>daughter of Gilbert, Earl of Strathearn, sister of
</p>
<p>Earl Robert, and had issue, three sons, Alexander,
</p>
<p>Gilbert and William, and one daughter, who
</p>
<p>married Patrick Edgar, and had issue, Walter, to
</p>
<p>whom two charters to East and West Cultma-
</p>
<p>lundie, were granted by his uncle, Gilbert, both
</p>
<p>undated, but confirmed i6th May 1279 by
</p>
<p>Alexander HI.
</p>
<p>Gilbert of Ruthven, son of Sir Walter, witnessed
</p>
<p>a charter along with his father about 1245. As Sir
</p>
<p>Gilbert he is a witness to charters in 1247 and 1266.
</p>
<p>In 1262 he renounced his right to the lands of
</p>
<p>Evelick and of the succession to Foulis through
</p>
<p>Cecilia de Maule. He married Cecilia, daughter of
</p>
<p>Sir John Maule of Foulis. He died between 1266
</p>
<p>and 1279, when the charter to his nephew, Walter
</p>
<p>Edgar, was confirmed by Alexander III. He was
</p>
<p>succeeded by his brother William, anno 1270.

<p>THE RUTHVEN FAMILY PAPERS
</p>
<p>William of Ruthven, perhaps the same who was
</p>
<p>chamberlain to Malise, Earl of Strathearn, wit-
</p>
<p>nessed a charter in 1270. As Sir William of
</p>
<p>Ruthven, he witnessed two charters in January
</p>
<p>1267-68, and another in 1290. He did homage to
</p>
<p>Edward I. in 1291 and 1296. As William of
</p>
<p>Ruthven, Lord of that ilk, he about 1298 confirmed
</p>
<p>the charter of his father, Walter, son of Alan, of
</p>
<p>the lands of Scone. He left two sons, Walter and
</p>
<p>Gilbert, by Margaret, d. of Ramsay of Auchterhouse.
</p>
<p>At the siege of Perth in 1297, Sir William
</p>
<p>Wallace substituted his own garrison for that of
</p>
<p>the English, but whether he appointed Sir John
</p>
<p>Ramsay or Sir William Ruthven, Governor of
</p>
<p>Perth, is certainly not clear. Sir William, with
</p>
<p>thirty followers, joined Wallace at this engagement
</p>
<p>and fought, it is recorded, with determined energy.
</p>
<p>For his gallant conduct Wallace appointed Sir
</p>
<p>William Ruthven Sheriff of Perth, to be hereditary
</p>
<p>in the Ruthven family. Sir William died in the
</p>
<p>following year, 1298.
</p>
<p>Walter of Ruthven, who succeeded, was a consent-
</p>
<p>ing party to his father's charter to Scone in 1298.
</p>
<p>He surrendered to the English at Strathord, along
</p>
<p>with Sir John Comyn of Badenoch, 9th February
</p>
<p>1303-4, and died about 1330. His successor was
</p>
<p>William of Ruthven, who paid a fine for the relief
</p>
<p>of Newton, in Edinburgh, in 1330. He died before

</p>
<p>Easter 1346, having been slain at the battle of
</p>
<p>Durham, and left issue, it is supposed, William
</p>
<p>and Margaret. The latter in 1346 married Sir
</p>
<p>John Seton, son of Alexander Seton of that ilk.
</p>
<p>His successor, Sir William Ruthven, anno 1330,
</p>
<p>had safe conducts in 1358, 1359, 1362, 1365, and
</p>
<p>died before 25th June 1376. A payment to Joanna,
</p>
<p>his wife, is entered in 1363. Sir William of
</p>
<p>Ruthven had a charter from Robert II. of the lands
</p>
<p>of Ruthven and Balerno, and another of the
</p>
<p>Sheriffship of Perth, 1393-95. He had a safe con-
</p>
<p>duct in 1400.
</p>
<p>He or his successor witnessed a charter by Sir
</p>
<p>John Oliphant of Aberdalgie, to Malcolm, his
</p>
<p>brother, which was confirmed by Sir John Mont-
</p>
<p>gomery of Ardrossan, 141 2. He died the same
</p>
<p>year. It is supposed he had two sons, William and
</p>
<p>David. The latter was granted by his brother the
</p>
<p>lands of Muirhall, Perth, in 1400.
</p>
<p>Sir William Ruthven of Balerno succeeded his
</p>
<p>father. He granted a charter to Walter Haliburton
</p>
<p>of Dirleton, which was confirmed by Robert, Duke
</p>
<p>of Albany, the Regent, 2nd February 1407-8. Sir
</p>
<p>William was in England as a hostage for the
</p>
<p>ransom of James I., 1424-27. He died in 1428, and
</p>
<p>left issue, one son, John, and two daughters, one
</p>
<p>married to Walter Drummond of Carlisle, the other
</p>
<p>to George Douglas of Leswalt.

<p>THE RUTHVEN FAMILY PAPERS
</p>
<p>Sir John Ruthven of Ruthvetij who succeeded his
</p>
<p>father, was at the assize of loth August 1440, and
</p>
<p>was appointed Sheriff of Perth, 21st April 1444.
</p>
<p>He probably died before 26th July 1454, from which
</p>
<p>date William Murray of Gask appears to have been
</p>
<p>Sheriff of Perth, and engaged in the temporary
</p>
<p>administration of that office.
</p>
<p>In 1443 John Gormac of Atholl, captain of a band
</p>
<p>of freebooters, attacked Sir John Ruthven, Sheriff
</p>
<p>of Perth, at the head of his guards, while leading a
</p>
<p>thief from Atholl to the gallows. A skirmish en-
</p>
<p>sued, when Gormac and thirteen of his men were
</p>
<p>slain, by Sir John and an escort, on the North Inch
</p>
<p>of Perth. According to the Exchequer Rolls, Sir
</p>
<p>John was also slain ; but this is not confirmed. On
</p>
<p>account of the weakness and inadequacy of the
</p>
<p>administration, no trial appears to have taken place
</p>
<p>in connection with this remarkable event.
</p>
<p>Sir John left issue, one son, named Patrick.
</p>
<p>Patrick Ruthven, probably Sheriff-depute of
</p>
<p>Perth, 9th May 1444. He appears, along with his
</p>
<p>father, 2nd January 145 1 ; is designated son of Sir
</p>
<p>John Ruthven, and grandson of Sir William
</p>
<p>Ruthven, 24th December 1458. He was knighted
</p>
<p>some time after; and as Sir Patrick Ruthven was
</p>
<p>on a jury, 6th October 1461 . He married a daughter
</p>
<p>of Sir Thomas Cranston, who is styled grandfather
</p>
<p>to his son and successor, 1465, and left issue, one

<p>On i8th June 1488, Sir William Ruthven joined
</p>
<p>King James IIL at Perth with 3000 troops, which
</p>
<p>formed, at the battle of Sauchie, a division of the
</p>
<p>army under the command of Sir William Ruthven,
</p>
<p>and where the King was basely murdered. For his
</p>
<p>heroic services on this occasion, Sir William was
</p>
<p>created first Lord Ruthven. He received many
</p>
<p>charters of lands in Perthshire before 1492. Lord
</p>
<p>Ruthven is said to have possessed great influence
</p>
<p>in his day, as he got the " limitation " to his
</p>
<p>natural son, and was an extensive landowner in
</p>
<p>Perthshire.
</p>
<p>Sir William, first Lord Ruthven. In the Acts of
</p>
<p>Auditorium of 1478, Sir William, Lord Ruthven,
</p>
<p>is stated to be son of Patrick Ruthven, grandson of
</p>
<p>Sir John Ruthven, and was made a Lord of Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment on 29th January 1488. William, Lord
</p>
<p>Ruthven, and Isobel, his wife, had charters of the
</p>
<p>lands of Cousland from Henry, Lord Sinclair, ist
</p>
<p>May 1493, and from David Bruce of Clackmannan,
</p>
<p>9th July 1500. Lord Ruthven had charters of

<p>Fife; and half of the lands of Strathbraan, Auch-
</p>
<p>more and Glenshee. He also had charters of Legert-
</p>
<p>law and Blackhall in Perthshire, and part of the
</p>
<p>barony of Lunan. Lord Ruthven married a
</p>
<p>daughter of Livingston of Saltcoats in East
</p>
<p>Lothian, by whom he had Walter, Master of
</p>
<p>Ruthven, 2nd July 1480. Charters were granted by
</p>
<p>Lord Ruthven to Walter, Master of Ruthven, and
</p>
<p>John Lindsay of Ruthven. The Master of Ruthven
</p>
<p>was legitimated under the Great Seal, 2nd July 1480,
</p>
<p>and had a charter of the barony of Ruthven, 1480.
</p>
<p>He and his father, Lord Ruthven, granted a
</p>
<p>charter of mortification, 14th January 1509, of an
</p>
<p>annual rent of ;^io for the support of the chaplain
</p>
<p>in the Chapel of St Peter at Ruthven Castle, and
</p>
<p>;^io for the support of the chaplain in the Church of
</p>
<p>the Blessed Virgin Mary at Tibbermuir, in the
</p>
<p>cemetery of the church there. The Master of
</p>
<p>Ruthven predeceased his father, and fell at Flodden,
</p>
<p>1513. His father died loth September 1528.
</p>
<p>In 1493 there was a quarrel between the town of
</p>
<p>Perth and Lord Ruthven, indicated in the following
</p>
<p>brief entry in the Council Records : Protest by the
</p>
<p>Town of Perth against William, Lord Ruthven,

<p>THE RUTHVEN AGREEMEINT
</p>
<p>protested that because William, Lord Ruthven, and
</p>
<p>William Ruthven, his son, were summoned at their
</p>
<p>instance for certain acts contained in the summons
</p>
<p>and would not compear, therefore they should not be
</p>
<p>heard in judgment against the town until they pay
</p>
<p>to them their costs and damages ; and until the
</p>
<p>Town be of new summonsed. (Extracted by John
</p>
<p>Fraser, Dean of Restalrig, Clerk of the Rolls,
</p>

</p>
<p>It is recorded in the last history of Perth (the
</p>
<p>Ancient Capital of Scotland) that among the earliest
</p>
<p>documents we have in connection with Lowswark,
</p>
<p>is one long after the Roman period  viz. the agree-
</p>
<p>ment of 4th November 1494, between William,
</p>
<p>Lord Ruthven, and William, his son, on the one
</p>
<p>part, and the magistrates of Perth and John Eviot
</p>
<p>of Balhousie, on the other part. The deed provides
</p>
<p>for the permanent maintenance of Lowswark, which
</p>
<p>is to be the retainer and closer of the aqueduct. It
</p>
<p>is appointed, touching the agreement made between
</p>
<p>William, Lord Ruthven, and the magistrates, and
</p>
<p>the leases of their mills in the taking of earth and
</p>
<p>stones from the lands of Ruthven, for the mainten-
</p>
<p>ance of the lade, and the inholding of the water.
</p>
<p>"The first parties bind and oblige themselves never
</p>
<p>to disturb the second parties in the peaceable pos-
</p>
<p>session of the lade, nor in taking earth and stones
</p>
<p>from the lands of Ruthven for its maintenance. It

<p>was understood by the contracting parties that the
</p>
<p>river Almond runs hard at the head, and enters the
</p>
<p>lade in which the mills stand in such volume that
</p>
<p>the lade may suffer great damage thereby. For
</p>
<p>remedy thereof the said parties bind and oblige
</p>
<p>themselves that there be made for their mutual good
</p>
<p>a sluice, at the head of the lade, for receiving a
</p>
<p>sufficient water supply for all the mills that stand
</p>
<p>thereon, and belonging to them ; and to defend and
</p>
<p>resist the over supply of water that is liable to flow,
</p>
<p>and cause the destruction of the lade or aqueduct,
</p>
<p>and that the auld wick called Lowswark be mended,
</p>
<p>built or reformed, so as to keep the water to its

</p>
<p>In connection with this the magistrates caused
</p>
<p>William Ruthven and his son to take the oath of
</p>
<p>fidelity, by which parties are mutually bound to
</p>
<p>each other without fraud or guile in respect of these
</p>
<p>conditions, and bind and oblige themselves accord-
</p>
<p>ingly in the strongest form of obligation. " The

<p>Methven, and others, 4th November 1494. These
</p>
<p>Perth mills, whatever their origin, were gifted by
</p>
<p>John Mercer to Malcolm III. in the eleventh cen-
</p>
<p>tury, in exchange for a vault in St John's Church;
</p>
<p>and from time immemorial have been driven by the
</p>
<p>water supply from the Almond.
</p>
<p>In the matter of the lands of Balhousie, which
</p>
<p>adjoin the Ruthven lands near Perth, the following
</p>
<p>appears on the Record :  Stirling 24th April 1510;
</p>
<p>King James IV. conceded to William, Lord
</p>
<p>Ruthven for life, and to his son William Ruthven,
</p>
<p>soldier, and his heirs, the superiority of the lands
</p>
<p>of the Feu in the barony of Balhousie, which John
</p>
<p>Eviot of Balhousie resigned, and which the King,
</p>
<p>for good services, joined to the barony of Ruthven.
</p>
<p>In his family chart, John Lindsay's son is given
</p>
<p>as James, not Alexander, and James's son is
</p>
<p>William, and William*s son Alexander, who was
</p>
<p>in Perth the day Gowrie, his third cousin, was
</p>
<p>slain ; and this Alexander escaped to England and
</p>
<p>changed his name to Trotter, the name of the lady
</p>
<p>he married. Alexander had a son, James, who had
</p>
<p>three sons, Alexander, John and James. Alexander
</p>
<p>(unmarried) and John quarrelled, and Alexander
</p>
<p>was killed by his brother. John had a son, Samuel,
</p>
<p>who had a son, John, whose son was Edward. This

<p>Edward had a son, Edward Southwell, who by

</p>
<p>Ruthven, of the barony of Legge Kingston, 5th
</p>
<p>February 1551. James died without issue, and
</p>
<p>Patricia, Lord Ruthven, was served heir to his
</p>
<p>brother, 9th January 1553. In addition to the above
</p>
<p>four brothers there were : Alexander Ruthven of

</p>
<p>The Ruthven family had their full share of
</p>
<p>charters in early times, as is evident from the
</p>
<p>Chartulary of Scone and from the Inchcolm Regis-
</p>
<p>ter. These charters date from a very early period

<p>of Scottish history  viz. from the twelfth century,
</p>
<p>when Thor, the original ancestor of the Ruthvens,

<p>granted his charter of Edenham. We give the

</p>
<p>What was called the King's Garden at Perth was,
</p>
<p>in the reign of James V., in the possession of the
</p>
<p>Blackfriars, and by them kept in repair. In July
</p>
<p>I535> in the lifetime of William, second Lord
</p>
<p>Ruthven, a number of men broke down the fences,
</p>
<p>and entering the Gilten Arbor hastily built at each
</p>
<p>end of it a butt or bowmark. Next morning the
</p>
<p>friars made a great outcry and complained to the
</p>
<p>King. A letter was thereupon addressed by the
</p>
<p>King to William, Lord Ruthven, Sheriff of the
</p>
<p>County, requesting him "to do justice to the
</p>
<p>Blackfriars in opposition to the Magistrates and

</p>
<p>the lands of the Gilten Arbor ; had taken possession
</p>
<p>thereof, nor paid them the damage and skaith they
</p>
<p>had sustained, unless now compelled to do so."
</p>
<p>The prior and friars protested that they had been
</p>
<p>refused a copy of the King's letter to Lord
</p>
<p>Ruthven. The King eventually reversed the order
</p>
<p>he had given to his lordship, and appointed
</p>
<p>Patrick Ogilvie of Inchmartine and Edmond Hay,
</p>
<p>Chamberlain of Errol, to be judges in the dispute,
</p>
<p>and ordered them to exercise the office of Sheriff.
</p>
<p>The King afterwards ordered the Corporation to
</p>
<p>pay the damage and to cease troubling the friars in
</p>
<p>all time coming.
</p>
<p>In 1544 the Regent, James Hamilton, Earl of
</p>
<p>Arran, at the instigation of Cardinal Beaton, turned
</p>
<p>Lord Ruthven out of the Provostship of Perth, and
</p>
<p>put in his place John Charteris of Kinfauns, a
</p>
<p>leading Catholic. The citizens resented this and a
</p>
<p>quarrel ensued. Charteris, assisted by Lord Gray,
</p>
<p>came with an armed force and attacked the town
</p>
<p>from the bridge ; while another division came by
</p>
<p>the river and attacked the south port. At the
</p>
<p>bridge port the drawbridge was up, and the iron-
</p>
<p>bound gates of the town were barred and bolted.

</p>
<p>forthwith raised three hundred horsemen, fully
</p>
<p>armed, and with this escort the journey to Callender
</p>
<p>House next morning was safely accomplished, the
</p>
<p>escort starting at five a.m. Two hours later Moray
</p>
<p>and Argyll were on the road to find that the Queen
</p>
<p>had been too many for them, and by her swift move-

</p>
<p>William, fourth Lord Ruthven, and first Earl of

<p>Gowrie, succeeded his father, the third Lord. He
</p>
<p>was engaged in the conspiracy against Riccio, and
</p>
<p>after his murder fled to England. He made peace
</p>
<p>and returned to Scotland, when he supported James
</p>
<p>VI. He was one of those who waited on the Queen
</p>
<p>at Loch Leven and by threats got her signature to

<p>her abdication of the crown. He was present at

<p>Treasurer of Scotland for life, 24th June 1571, and
</p>
<p>an Extraordinary Lord of Session, 25th November

<p>THE RUTHVEN FAMILY PAPERS
</p>
<p>Dirleton had a charter of the lordship of Abernethy
</p>
<p>in Perthshire, 14th December 1581. He was the
</p>
<p>principal actor in the treasonable conspiracy to seize
</p>
<p>King James VI. and take him out of the hands of
</p>
<p>the Duke of Lennox and the Earl of Arran. This
</p>
<p>was the Raid of Ruthven of 23rd August 1582.
</p>
<p>The King being in the power of the conspirators
</p>
<p>they obliged him to grant them a remission, and
</p>
<p>they procured from the Assembly of the Church,
</p>
<p>3rd October 1582, an Act declaring that they had
</p>
<p>done good and acceptable service to God, to their
</p>
<p>Sovereign, and to the nation, requiring all sincere
</p>
<p>Protestants to concur with them in carrying forward
</p>
<p>such a laudable enterprise.
</p>
<p>A Convention of the Estates assembled on the
</p>
<p>13th of that month and passed an Act to the same
</p>
<p>effect and granted full indemnity to the conspirators
</p>
<p>for everything they had done.
</p>
<p>Ruthven had a charter of a house at Holyrood,
</p>
<p>3rd November 1582. The following year the King
</p>
<p>escaped out of their hands, but, visiting the Earl of
</p>
<p>Cowrie at Ruthven Castle, he granted Cowrie a full
</p>
<p>pardon.
</p>
<p>A Convention of the Estates being held declared
</p>
<p>those concerned in this Raid of Ruthven to have
</p>
<p>been guilty of high treason, ordered the Act ap-
</p>
<p>proving of this conduct to be cancelled, and en-
</p>
<p>gaged the support of the King in prosecuting them

</p>
<p>with the utmost rigour of law. Gowrie, notwith-
</p>
<p>standing the pardon he had received, was in 1584
</p>
<p>commanded to leave Scotland and reside in France.
</p>
<p>While he waited at Dundee for an opportunity to
</p>
<p>embark he was informed that the Earls of Angus
</p>
<p>and Mar had concocted a scheme for surprising
</p>
<p>Stirling Castle. Gowrie concurred with them, and
</p>
<p>delayed his voyage so as to take up arms on the
</p>
<p>day fixed. This awakened suspicion and Arran
</p>
<p>arrested him after a heroic struggle. He was tried
</p>
<p>for high treason and executed at Stirling between
</p>
<p>eight and nine on the evening of the same day. On
</p>
<p>the scaffold he said: " If I had served God as
</p>
<p>faithfully as I served the King I would not have
</p>
<p>come to this end." He died patiently, with every
</p>
<p>assurance of mercy in God's hands.
</p>
<p>On 7th May 1580, John, third Earl of Gowrie,
</p>
<p>was by Royal Charter created Commendator of the
</p>
<p>Monastery and Abbey of Scone as follows :

<p>THE RUTHVEN FAMILY PAPERS
</p>
<p>After her husband's death she was forfeited, and
</p>
<p>basely used by James VI., surviving to see the
</p>
<p>ruin of her family ; she was residing at Dirleton at
</p>
<p>the period of the Gowrie Conspiracy. William,
</p>
<p>fourth Lord Ruthven, had issue : James, second
</p>
<p>Earl of Gowrie ; John, third Earl of Gowrie ; Alex-
</p>
<p>ander, Master of Gowrie, born at Perth, 22nd
</p>
<p>January 1581 ; killed along with his brother at
</p>
<p>Gowrie House in 1600; William Ruthven, he chose
</p>
<p>the countess, 28th July 1599  the next-of-kin on his
</p>
<p>father's side being James Ruthven, chantor of Dun-
</p>
<p>keld. At his brother's death he fled to England,
</p>
<p>with his brother, Patrick, and was there sheltered
</p>
<p>by Queen Elizabeth. On his death a proclamation
</p>
<p>was issued against him, 27th April 1603, by James
</p>
<p>VI. He became a chemist and philosopher, and is
</p>
<p>probably that brother of the Earl of Gowrie who,
</p>
<p>according to Bishop Burnett, died beyond the sea,
</p>
<p>and of whom it was given out, he had the philos-
</p>
<p>opher's stone. Patrick Ruthven, M.D., styled
</p>
<p>Lord Ruthven, escaped with his brother to Eng-
</p>
<p>land, where, on the King's proclamation, he was
</p>
<p>arrested and conveyed to the Tower of London,
</p>
<p>June 1603, and imprisoned there nineteen years.
</p>
<p> In the north-east corner of the choir of St John's Church,
</p>
<p>Perth, was the burying-place of the Cowries. Wilham, first
</p>
<p>Earl, was interred there, and also his three sons, the second
</p>
<p>and third Earls, and Alexander Ruthven, last two of whom
</p>
<p>sufifered violent deaths.

<p>he alleged had been restored to his father by the
</p>
<p>Scottish Parliament of 1641 ; or, if this refused, to

<p>Gowrie, the eldest son, was baptised on 25th
</p>
<p>September 1575 ; was restored to his estates and
</p>
<p>manors, 1586, his mother being tutrix, and obtained
</p>
<p>ratification of the Earldom, 1587 ; he died in 1588 in
</p>
<p>his fourteenth year, and was succeeded by his
</p>
<p>brother John.
</p>
<p>There are now three distinct branches of this
</p>
<p>once great family claiming descent from the main
</p>
<p>branch. Lord Ruthven of Freeland, a creation of
</p>
<p>Charles II., 165 1, is descended from Alexander,
</p>
<p>fifth son of the second Lord Ruthven (old creation).
</p>
<p>The male line has twice died out, and the title been
</p>
<p>taken, in the first instance, by the youngest sister
</p>
<p>of David, the second Lord of Freeland ; then by his
</p>
<p>niece; and, in the second instance, by a sister of
</p>
<p>James, Lord Ruthven, who died in 1853  namely,
</p>
<p>the Baroness Mary Elizabeth Thornton Ruthven.
</p>
<p>This lady married Walter Hore of Harperstown,
</p>
<p>Co. Wexford, Ireland; and the present holder of
</p>
<p>the title, Walter James Hore-Ruthven, succeeded
</p>
<p>the Baroness, his grandmother. The patent is un-
</p>
<p>recorded, and its precise terms are unknown, as it

<p>says that " collateral proofs exist that heirs female
</p>
<p>were not excluded."
</p>
<p>A branch of the Ruthven family descended from
</p>
<p>John, second son of the first Lord Ruthven (old
</p>
<p>creation), is found in Ireland. Its present repre-
</p>
<p>sentative resides in Australia. Alexander Ruthven,
</p>
<p>a great-grandson of John, and third cousin of John,
</p>
<p>third Earl of Gowrie, fled at the time of the down-
</p>
<p>fall of the family in 1600. His lands were given by
</p>
<p>the King to Sir Thomas Erskine, afterwards created
</p>
<p>Earl of Kelso. In 1602 he escaped into England,
</p>
<p>and having married one of the Trotter family
</p>
<p>(in the Merse) he took that name and settled
</p>
<p>in Durham, where he purchased lands. His
</p>
<p>grandson, John, went over to Ireland, where his
</p>
<p>descendants have been ever since. His descendant,
</p>
<p>Edward Southwell Ruthven, born 1773, received a
</p>
<p>Royal Licence on i6th June 1801 to the effect that
</p>
<p>he and his issue might assume and take the sur-
</p>
<p>name of Ruthven only, as borne by their ancestors.
</p>
<p>There is another branch of the Ruthvens claim-
</p>
<p>ing descent from John, third Earl of Gowrie. The
</p>
<p>following narrative is from a document in the pos-
</p>
<p>session of a member of the family :

</p>
<p>some time, ventured to proceed to a captain of the
</p>
<p>army, telling him the tragical circumstances, and
</p>
<p>offered her services, if he would undertake to protect
</p>
<p>the child. This the captain at once agreed to do.
</p>
<p>He brought the youth up in his own family, he
</p>
<p>educated him, and the youth eventually married a
</p>
<p>relation of the captain's. It is not known what the
</p>
<p>captain's name was, nor are any of the circum-
</p>
<p>stances distinctly known otherwise than by tradi-
</p>
<p>tion, but there is an old lady of the name of Dick
</p>
<p>in Kilmarnock at this time  1843  who is a descen-
</p>
<p>dant of the captain's, and well versed in the cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances and genealogy of young Ruthven, the
</p>
<p>heir, who was now obliged to reside in comparative
</p>
<p>obscurity, his name being prohibited and estates
</p>
<p>confiscated. He is represented as being of an
</p>
<p>exceedingly amiable temperament, and an excellent
</p>
<p>musician. (He left issue, one son, John Ruthven,
</p>
<p>who it is supposed was a professor of music and a
</p>
<p>composer of some talent.) "
</p>
<p>Then follows John Ruthven, great-grandson of
</p>
<p>John, third Earl of Gowrie. He was married to
</p>
<p>Marion Paedie at Eastwood Parish Church in 1717,
</p>
<p>and died in 1732, aged forty-five, and was interred in
</p>
<p>the crypt of Glasgow Cathedral. His two elder sons,

<p>both named John, have no descendants. The first
</p>
<p>JOHN, EARL OF GOWRIE
</p>
<p>son, John, died in infancy, the second son, John,
</p>
<p>married Mary Henderson, and had several children,
</p>
<p>all of them dying young, save one daughter,
</p>
<p>Margaret, who died unmarried in 1817; but his
</p>
<p>third son, James, born in 1725, had two sons,
</p>
<p>James, born in 1752, and John, born in 1753.
</p>
<p>James, born in 1752, had a son, James, born in
</p>
<p>1776, who had a son, James, born in 1809, whose
</p>
<p>son, James, is the present representative of this
</p>
<p>branch, and resides in Hull, Yorkshire.
</p>
<p>John, born in 1753, emigrated to the United
</p>
<p>States, and his eldest son, James, born 1783,
</p>
<p>married his first cousin, Jean Ruthven, born 1781,
</p>
<p>daughter of James, born 1752. They left an only
</p>
<p>son, James, who is represented to-day by a
</p>
<p>daughter, Mrs Ruthven-Stuart, who is descended
</p>
<p>from both James, born 1752, and John, born 1753,
</p>
<p>and who resides in London.
</p>
<p>All historians appear to agree that there is no
</p>
<p>evidence that John, third Earl of Gowrie, was
</p>
<p>married. But it is a fact that very little is known
</p>
<p>about him during the six years he was abroad, from
</p>
<p>1594 to 1600. Every effort is being made to dis-
</p>
<p>cover something that will thro\v light on what is at
</p>
<p>present involved in mystery.

<p>G. P. R. James, an eminent writer, in his book,

<p>dealing with a general view of the subject, after
</p>
<p>stating that " he has not spared labour, research,

<p>paragraph, that the lady whom it was proposed the

<p>Earl should eventually marry was in reality the

<p>Lady Margaret Douglas, daughter of the Earl of
</p>

<p>JOHN, EARL OF COWRIE'S SON
</p>
<p>James, seems to take away one's breath for the
</p>
<p>moment. The bona fide manner in which the sub-
</p>
<p>ject is presented to us fully entitles it to respectful
</p>
<p>consideration.
</p>
<p>We do not think anyone will call it in question
</p>
<p>or challenge it for the very good reason that there
</p>
<p>is nothing to lean upon save the " baseless fabric
</p>
<p>of a vision." The general concensus of public
</p>
<p>opinion will undoubtedly take the other view and
</p>
<p>accept the narrative, a narrative which should have
</p>
<p>been made public long ago, but kept in retentis by
</p>
<p>the family, whose attention we may presume was
</p>
<p>too much involved in the downright robbery and
</p>
<p>confiscation of their estates to warrant their putting
</p>
<p>this purely secondary matter before the public.
</p>
<p>In short, the Ruthven Papers, with all their
</p>
<p>important details, civic as well as historical, have
</p>
<p>never till now been published, although the sub-
</p>
<p>ject matter is three centuries old. There is nothing
</p>
<p>in the least unlikely in a son being born to John,
</p>
<p>third Earl of Gowrie. It is the most likely thing in
</p>
<p>the world. The difficulty is to prove the marriage,
</p>
<p>and to define whether the son so born to the Earl
</p>
<p>was, or was not, legitimate. It is a fact that the
</p>
<p>main branch of the family of which the Earl of
</p>
<p>Gowrie was head has gone on through all these
</p>
<p>centuries multiplying and branching out. What a
</p>
<p>noble history, and what an ancient national history

<p>is that of the Ruthven family, from its inception in
</p>
<p>the twelfth century, to the beginning of the seven-
</p>
<p>teenth, when the downfall of the family was
</p>
<p>heralded by a weak, but cunning and tyrannical,
</p>
<p>monarch. The assassination of the Gowries was the
</p>
<p>most indefensible act that has ever appeared on the
</p>
<p>pages of Scottish history, and its fraudulent and
</p>
<p>treacherous and false record, carefully and deliber-
</p>
<p>ately recorded in the Privy Council Register, the
</p>
<p>Acts of the Scottish Parliament and other official
</p>
<p>publications of the Crown, seem as a chapter of
</p>
<p>fraud and perjury to deliberate upon, a chapter from
</p>
<p>which we cannot exclude the Scottish Parliament of
</p>
<p>that period from the guilt attaching to them, and as
</p>
<p>more or less actors and abettors in a cunning con-
</p>
<p>spiracy that has disgraced the historical record for
</p>
<p>more than three hundred years.

</p>
<p>him. William Ruthven of Ballindean died before

<p>June 1566, leaving issue, William, who suc-

<p>ceeded him. His daughter Janet married Adam
</p>
<p>Stewart, Prior of the Charterhouse, natural son of

<p>Margaret and Elizabeth.
</p>
<p>Sir William married Catherine Stewart, daughter

<p>CAREER OF GENERAL RUTHVEN
</p>
<p>Gustavus in 1632, General Patrick Ruthven was
</p>
<p>appointed Governor of that important place, and
</p>
<p>by uncommon vigilance suppressed two conspir-
</p>
<p>acies in their infancy. He was high in favour
</p>
<p>with Gustavus for two different reasons. He always
</p>
<p>behaved gallantly in the field ; and when the King
</p>
<p>wanted to regale the Ministers of the adverse party,
</p>
<p>in order to extract secrets from them in their cheer-
</p>
<p>ful hours, he made Ruthven Field-Marshal of the
</p>
<p>Bottles and Glasses, as he could drink immeasur-
</p>
<p>ably and preserve his understanding to the last.
</p>
<p>Ulm was chosen for the royal magazine, as well as
</p>
<p>a place of retreat in case of accident, and was
</p>
<p>gallantly defended by General Ruthven, in con-
</p>
<p>sideration of whose merit and long services,
</p>
<p>Gustavus gave him a grant of the Earldom of
</p>
<p>Richberg, worth about ;^i8oo per annum. In 1637
</p>
<p>he was Major-General Ruthven and Governor of
</p>
<p>Edinburgh Castle, on his return from Sweden. In
</p>
<p>1639 he was created Lord Ruthven of Ettrick. He
</p>
<p>refused to surrender Edinburgh Castle to the
</p>
<p>Covenanters in 1640 and was for this contumacy
</p>
<p>forefaulted by Act of Parliament in June 1640, but
</p>
<p>stood a siege till 13th September, and eventually
</p>
<p>surrendered, 19th September 1640. His forfeiture
</p>
<p>was cancelled by the influence of General Leslie in
</p>
<p>November 1641. The name of Ruthven, forfeited
</p>
<p>in 1600, was restored to the Ballindean family, 17th

<p>November 1641. He was created Earl of Forth by-
</p>
<p>letters patent, dated at York, 27th March 1642,
</p>
<p>with limitation to the heirs male of his body. His
</p>
<p>lordship joined King Charles I. at Shrewsbury in
</p>
<p>1642, and was appointed Field-Marshal of the
</p>
<p>forces, and fought at the battle of Edgehill, 23rd
</p>
<p>October 1642, when the Earl of Lindsay, General
</p>
<p>of his Majesty's army, being killed, the chief com-
</p>
<p>mand was conferred on the Earl of Forth, who was
</p>
<p>one of those in whom the King principally con-
</p>
<p>fided. Lord Clarendon draws his character thus :
</p>
<p>" Though he had been without doubt a very good
</p>
<p>Officer and was still a man of unquestionable
</p>
<p>courage and integrity, yet he was now much de-
</p>
<p>cayed; and with the long continued custom of
</p>
<p>immoderate drinking, dozed in his understanding,
</p>
<p>which had been quick and vigorous, he having
</p>
<p>been always illiterate to the greatest degree. He
</p>
<p>was now become very deaf : yet often pretended to
</p>
<p>have heard what he did not then contradict, and
</p>
<p>thought fit afterwards to disclaim. He was a man
</p>
<p>of few words and great compliance, and usually
</p>
<p>delivered that as his opinion which he foresaw
</p>
<p>would be grateful to the King. He could judge
</p>
<p>better by his eye than his ears ; and in the Field well
</p>
<p>knew what was to be done." This character is
</p>
<p>couched in no very favourable terms and the ver-

<p>acity of it may be doubtful. According to Harte, in
</p>
<p>GENERAL RUTHVEN WOUNDED
</p>
<p>the Ashmole collection is a gallant letter from this
</p>
<p>officer to the Earl of Northumberland, who had
</p>
<p>traduced the reputation of a young gentlewoman
</p>
<p>whom Ruthven esteemed; and libelled the whole
</p>
<p>Scottish nation in some political invective. It is
</p>
<p>certain that under the command of the Earl of
</p>
<p>Forth, the military skill displayed by the royal
</p>
<p>army was never more conspicuous and successful.
</p>
<p>He defeated the Parliamentary forces at Brentford,
</p>
<p>15th November 1642, and was in honour of that
</p>
<p>victory created a peer of England by the title of
</p>
<p>Earl of Brentford, 26th May 1644.
</p>
<p>The Scottish Parliament passed a decree of for-
</p>
<p>feiture against Patrick, Earl of Forth, 26th July
</p>
<p>1644. At the second battle of Newbury, 27th
</p>
<p>November 1644, his lordship was wounded in the
</p>
<p>head, and carried to Donnington Castle, to which
</p>
<p>the Parliament sent the traitor, Harry, to persuade
</p>
<p>him to give it up, which the Earl rejected with the
</p>
<p>indignation that became him. He continued in the
</p>
<p>King's service until the end of this war in England ;
</p>
<p>was one of those excepted from pardon by the
</p>
<p>Articles of Westminster, nth July 1646, which the
</p>
<p>King refused to ratify. He was succeeded by
</p>
<p>Prince Rupert, 26th March 1645, and was made
</p>
<p>chamberlain to the Prince of Wales, and accom-
</p>
<p>panied King Charles to Scotland in 1650.

<p>him against his forfeiture, 20th March 1647 J ^^^
</p>
<p>his forfeiture was again rescinded after his death
</p>
<p>by the Parliament of 1661. His lordship died at
</p>
<p>an advanced age, at Dundee, 3rd January 165 1,
</p>
<p>when his titles became extinct, and was interred in
</p>
<p>Monifieth Church. The Earl of Forth and Brent-
</p>
<p>ford married Clara Barnard, and by her, who died
</p>
<p>in August 1679, had three daughters  Lady
</p>
<p>Patricia, married to the Hon. Sir Thomas Ogilvie,
</p>
<p>slain at the battle of Inverlochy in 1645, second
</p>
<p>son of James, first Earl of Airlie, without issue;
</p>
<p>Lady Jean, married James, second Lord Forrester,
</p>
<p>and had issue; Lady Elspeth, married Major
</p>
<p>George Pringle, brother of Whytbank, and had
</p>
<p>issue.
</p>
<p>According to the new Peerage he was three times
</p>
<p>married, and left issue, Alexander, Lord Ettrick,

<p>by his second wife ; Patrick, by his third wife ; and
</p>
<p>three daughters.

<p>Shortly after the accession of Charles H. we have
</p>
<p>the following charter recorded in appreciation of
</p>
<p>his military services and his distinguished and un-
</p>
<p>wearied exertions on behalf of the Crown. It was

<p>a graceful act on the part of the King to confer on

<p>Charles by the grace of God, of England, Scot-
</p>
<p>land, France, and Ireland, King, to the Arch-
</p>

<p>their valour by mighty deeds performed in our

<p>service should in turn receive favour from us, so
</p>
<p>that others may have a more potent stimulus to
</p>
<p>follow in their footsteps. We therefore have con-
</p>
<p>sidered that our beloved cousin, Patrick, Earl of
</p>
<p>Forth, while possessing the bounteous gifts of
</p>
<p>character and fortune v/ith which the offspring of
</p>
<p>an ancient line of noble ancestors is duly endowed,
</p>
<p>has added further lustre by his own valour and
</p>
<p>diligence and especially by the renown and glory
</p>
<p>which he gained after much toil and the flight of
</p>
<p>long years. For from his youth he has studied the
</p>
<p>art of war among peoples of the most bellicose
</p>
<p>spirit, Swedes, Danes, Russians, Prussians and
</p>
<p>Germans. There he ever received high praise even
</p>
<p>from the enemy. He rose through all the ranks of
</p>
<p>promotion and was finally raised to the highest
</p>
<p>dignity of Marshal, arriving thus at the pinnacle of
</p>
<p>martial ambition in foreign countries he was then
</p>
<p>of an age to retire from active service, but was
</p>
<p>seized by a longing for his native land where he

</p>
<p>thought a haven of rest lay provided for him. Con-
</p>
<p>trary to his expectation he landed in the furnace of
</p>
<p>Civil Strife in which many were drawn over to the
</p>
<p>other side. Yet, although the men who stirred up
</p>
<p>rebellion left no means untried by which to gain
</p>
<p>him for their party, even offering him of their own
</p>
<p>free will the supreme command of the war, he did
</p>
<p>not stoop to that depth of infamy to which others
</p>
<p>fell who eagerly grasped the offer which he in his
</p>
<p>uprightness treated with contempt. Thereafter he
</p>
<p>continued to keep pure and unsullied the trust
</p>
<p>reposed in him, and proved it by many successful
</p>
<p>achievements in many places.
</p>
<p>First at the siege of Edinburgh Castle he en-
</p>
<p>dured on our behalf seven months of famine and
</p>
<p>want to the detriment of his health. Thereafter
</p>
<p>when the same mad fury made its way to England,
</p>
<p>we summoned him that we might get his advice for
</p>
<p>the overthrow and crushing of rebellion. He was
</p>
<p>joyful and eager to play his part thinking not of
</p>
<p>the certain peril of his fortunes. Here, to mention
</p>
<p>only the more noteworthy among many, the en-
</p>
<p>gagements at Edgehill, Brentford and Newbury,
</p>
<p>will afford no uncertain evidence of his zeal and
</p>
<p>energy. In all of these he carried out the duties and
</p>
<p>offices of a brave soldier, no less than of a skilful
</p>
<p>leader. Since Earl Patrick has hitherto shown
</p>
<p>himself a right valiant defender of our crown and

<p>Jean.
</p>
<p>David, Lord Ruthven, died in 1701, unmarried,

<p>and in the same year the Honourable Jean Ruthven
</p>
<p>succeeded her brother, styling herself Jean, Lady

<p>Ruthven; she died in 1722, unmarried.

<p>Sir William Cunynghame of Cunynghamhead,

</p>
<p>He was succeeded by his niece, Lady Isobel.

<p>Isobel, Lady Ruthven, was the daughter of Eliza-

<p>George H. in 1727. She married James Johnston,

<p>his time. He and his lady, with the rest of the

<p>peerage, were summoned to the Coronation of

<p>George III. in 1761. He left a son, James, who
</p>
<p>succeeded him, and was the ancestor of the present

<p>Lord Ruthven.
</p>
<p>The Honourable Jean Ruthven, No. 3 of the

</p>
<p>brother David's death. On loth December 1702
</p>
<p>she received sasine of an heritable Bond, of an

<p>annual rent, granted in her favour by David
</p>
<p>Oliphant. On 12th November 1709, in a renuncia-

</p>
<p>herself Jean, Lady Ruthven. In an Instrument of

<p>Sasine of subjects in Forteviot she, in January 171 2,

<p>styled herself Jean, Lady Ruthven. On 9th

<p>September 1721 she caused herself, as Jean,

<p>Then there is the testament dative of Isobel

<p>Ruthven, spouse of Colonel James Ruthven of
</p>
<p>Graitney.
</p>
<p>James, Lord Ruthven, succeeded his mother, who
</p>
<p>is designated Isobel, Lady Ruthven. The Ruthven
</p>
<p>peerage came up for trial in the Court of Session,
</p>
<p>December 1732. There was a jury of fifteen. It
</p>
<p>was then declared that David, Lord Ruthven, was
</p>
<p>granduncle of James Ruthven of Ruthven, son of
</p>
<p>Colonel James Johnston or Ruthven of Graitney,
</p>
<p>and Isobel, Lady Ruthven, his spouse, who was

<p>the only daughter and child of Sir Francis Ruthven
</p>
<p>of Reidcastle, and Dame Elizabeth Ruthven, his
</p>
<p>wife, second sister german of the late David, Lord
</p>
<p>Ruthven. In 1739 the Ruthven title was marked

<p>out for inquiry by the judges of the Court of

<p>summoned, with the other Scottish peers, to the

<p>Ruthven and his lady were summoned to the Coro-
</p>
<p>nation of George IV. (J. H. Stevenson.)
</p>
<p>The Ruthven Family Papers
</p>
<p>The so-called Gowrie Conspiracy, a plot, as it
</p>
<p>now appears, to assassinate John, third Earl of
</p>
<p>Gowrie, and his brother, Alexander Ruthven, took
</p>
<p>place on 5th August 1600 at Gowrie House, Perth.
</p>
<p>The circumstances attending the origin and negoti-
</p>
<p>ation of this atrocious deed have been a profound
</p>
<p>State secret ; kept absolutely in the dark ; relegated
</p>
<p>to obscurity ; and posterity has been left to unravel
</p>
<p>a great mystery involving the honour, the integrity,
</p>
<p>the truthfulness of the King. Our recent inspection
</p>
<p>of the Ruthven Family Papers throws daylight on
</p>
<p>the event, though it be fully three centuries old.
</p>
<p>The Court of James VI., like that of his mother,
</p>
<p>was essentially corrupt, and he had no difficulty in
</p>
<p>finding men there who would second his efforts in
</p>
<p>the commission of crime, even if the crime were
</p>
<p>murder. James was double-minded, jealous, cruel
</p>
<p>and cunning; at times facile almost to imbecility.
</p>
<p>He had evidently made up his mind that John, Earl
</p>
<p>of Gowrie, was a step nearer the English throne
</p>
<p>than himself, and in that he was probably right, for
</p>
<p>Cowrie's mother, Lady Dorothea Stuart, was sup-

<p>posed to be the daughter of Queen Margaret Tudor
</p>
<p>by Lord Methven, her third husband, consequently
</p>
<p>Gowrie would, in that case, be nephew to Henry
</p>
<p>VIII., Queen Margaret's brother and Queen Eliza-
</p>
<p>beth's father. There are writers who say that
</p>
<p>Cowrie's mother was a daughter of Lady Janet
</p>
<p>Stuart of the AthoU family, by her husband. Lord
</p>
<p>Methven. The point is debatable, and has never
</p>
<p>been finally determined. The balance of evidence
</p>
<p>seems rather in favour of Lady Janet Stuart,
</p>
<p>daughter of John, Earl of Atholl.
</p>
<p>James, because of Cowrie's supposed precedence,
</p>
<p>as a competitor for the English throne, evidently
</p>
<p>resolved in his own mind that, whatever the con-
</p>
<p>sequences. Cowrie must be removed, as Elizabeth,
</p>
<p>in his opinion, would undoubtedly prefer Gowrie,
</p>
<p>who was an accomplished scholar, and the hand-
</p>
<p>somest young man of his time. These were points
</p>
<p>that would influence the English Queen in the
</p>
<p>nomination of her successor; and further, James
</p>
<p>was indebted to Gowrie in a large sum of money,
</p>
<p>advanced on mortgage by the first Earl, and he
</p>
<p>evidently believed that Cowrie's removal would for
</p>
<p>ever extinguish and cancel the debt.
</p>
<p>John, Earl of Gowrie, is said to have spent nearly
</p>
<p>two months at the English Court on his way home
</p>
<p>from Padua, and this would appear to have been
</p>
<p>a period of great nervous excitement on James' part,

</p>
<p>THE GOWRIE PLOT
</p>
<p>for he knew that Elizabeth had received Gowrie
</p>
<p>with open arms, and treated him with lavish hos-
</p>
<p>pitality, ordered the Court to supply him with a
</p>
<p>bodyguard, and to treat him in every respect as a
</p>
<p>royal person, all expenses paid out of the English
</p>
<p>Exchequer. James might well be nervous, for no-
</p>
<p>body had the slightest idea what would be the result
</p>
<p>of Elizabeth's uncertain mind.
</p>
<p>The Ruthven narrative of the conspiracy, as now
</p>
<p>discovered, cannot fail to be recognised, and will
</p>
<p>be recognised, as the true version of the atrocious
</p>
<p>deed. It is an absolute repudiation of the King's
</p>
<p>narrative, and gives a bona fide account of what
</p>
<p>actually took place on that fatal day, the 5th August
</p>
<p>1600. Its main point is that the King was the con-
</p>
<p>spirator, and the reader will see from the text the
</p>
<p>reasons which are believed to have induced the way-
</p>
<p>ward King to do what he did. It was part of the
</p>
<p>King's scheme that every man who favoured
</p>
<p>Gowrie was to be promptly executed, and this order
</p>
<p>was carried out to the letter. Though many execu-
</p>
<p>tions took place, the number is conveniently not
</p>
<p>recorded.
</p>
<p>The King's version may now be put aside as
</p>
<p>unworthy of the place it has so long occupied in
</p>
<p>Scottish history. Historians, such as Macaulay,
</p>
<p>have thrown it aside long ago, but now we have
</p>
<p>sure ground to go upon. What led up to the con-

<p>THE RUTHVEN FAMILY PAPERS
</p>
<p>spiracy seems now as clear as noonday, but we must
</p>
<p>remember that the King had some experience of
</p>
<p>conspiracies, for he put to death in the same
</p>
<p>manner the young Earl of Moray, by the hands of
</p>
<p>the Earl of Huntly, for no other known reason
</p>
<p>except that Moray was the handsomest man of his
</p>
<p>time, and representative of the Regent Moray,
</p>
<p>murderer of his mother. It is proper to
</p>
<p>state that no attempt was ever made by
</p>
<p>any member of the Gowrie family to aspire to the
</p>
<p>throne of England.
</p>
<p>In carrying out his diabolical plot, James would
</p>
<p>appear to have taken into his confidence certain
</p>
<p>nobles, who were constantly about his person, and
</p>
<p>on whom he was satisfied he could depend  the
</p>
<p>Earls of Mar and Lennox, Sir Thomas Erskine, Sir
</p>
<p>Hugh Herries, Sir John Ramsay and Captain
</p>
<p>David Murray. Lennox had once been Cowrie's
</p>
<p>brother-in-law, but his wife. Lady Sophia Ruthven,
</p>
<p>was dead eight years before the conspiracy, and
</p>
<p>Lennox had married twice since her death ; Herries
</p>
<p>was a son of Lord Herries, the devoted friend of
</p>
<p>Queen Mary; Captain Murray does not appear to
</p>
<p>have been inside Gowrie House on the fatal
</p>
<p>day. Evidently he was told off to superintend
</p>
<p>matters outside, for he took no part in the assassina-
</p>

<p>on the Perth bridge till all was over, clearly indi-
</p>
<p>cating the existence of a preconcerted plot to murder
</p>
<p>Gowrie, otherwise Henderson would have rushed
</p>
<p>to Cowrie's assistance, seeing at that moment he
</p>
<p>was Cowrie's steward. The conspirators had evi-
</p>
<p>dently bought him over. These men had their
</p>
<p>work cut out for them, and a critical reading of the
</p>
<p>King's version proves how systematically and
</p>
<p>deliberately the plot was conceived and carried out.
</p>
<p>At a particular moment, doubtless understood by
</p>
<p>his six nobles as the moment for Cowrie's assassina-
</p>
<p>tion, the King cried from the window of the turret
</p>
<p>chamber : " Treason, help, I am murdered." This
</p>
<p>was the signal for ]\Iar and Lennox rushing up the
</p>
<p>great staircase leading to the turret chamber and
</p>
<p>endeavouring to burst open the door, but could not.
</p>
<p>This was probably prearranged. Ramsay, Erskine
</p>
<p>and Herries went up a back stair with drawn
</p>
<p>swords and got immediate access to the chamber
</p>
<p>where the King and Alexander Ruthven were,
</p>
<p>when Ruthven was instantly slain by Ramsay and
</p>
<p>the Earl immediately after met his fate.

<p>We shall now proceed to put before the reader

<p>the Ruthven version of the plot, extracted by us

<p>appearance of an ancient document: 
</p>
<p>The tragic exit of John, Earl of Gowrie, and the
</p>
<p>ruin of the great Ruthven family, is one of the most
</p>
<p>perplexing events of Scottish history. It is still the
</p>
<p>belief of lovers of religion and liberty in Scotland
</p>
<p>that the Gowrie family fell a sacrifice to the enemies
</p>
<p>of the Reformation, because of their zeal for the
</p>
<p>support of it, and that the innocent blood of the
</p>
<p>Earl of Gowrie and his brother is a crying sin
</p>
<p>hanging over the nation. The Reformation in
</p>
<p>Scotland, from Popery to Presbytery, was popular
</p>
<p>and Parliamentary. The Protestants were sup-
</p>
<p>ported by Queen Elizabeth, the Catholics by the
</p>
<p>French. The leaders of the Protestants were called
</p>
<p>Lords of the Congregation. Patrick, Lord
</p>
<p>Ruthven, was one of the most zealous of them.
</p>
<p>He died in 1566, and was succeeded by his son,
</p>
<p>William, Lord Ruthven, afterwards first Earl of
</p>
<p>Gowrie, who married the Lady Dorothea Stuart,
</p>
<p>daughter of Henry, Lord Methven, by Margaret,
</p>
<p>Queen Dowager of Scotland. When King James
</p>
<p>took the administration of affairs upon himself,
</p>
<p>though ruled and protected by the Protestants, far
</p>
<p>from being grateful to them, or taking a lesson
</p>
<p>from his mother's misfortunes, he soon came under
</p>
<p>the control of his cousins, the Princes of Lorraine.

</p>
<p>himself in the power and under the direction of
</p>
<p>Stewart, whom he made Earl of Arran, and who
</p>
<p>had his instructions from the Catholics abroad.
</p>
<p>His protection given to the Catholic lords, Huntly,
</p>
<p>Crawford and Errol, and favour shown them after
</p>
<p>repeated acts of rebellion, gave an early indication
</p>
<p>of James' double-mindedness ; and if their rebellion
</p>
<p>had proved successful the design was to re-establish
</p>
<p>Popery. After the death of the great lords and
</p>
<p>clergy who had established the Reformation, their
</p>
<p>party, feared and despised by the Court, were cast
</p>
<p>down and dispirited, their clergy poor and at the
</p>
<p>mercy of the Crown for their small livings. Every-
</p>
<p>thing was done to ruin these Protestants, who de-
</p>
<p>pended solely on William, Earl of Cowrie, and his
</p>
<p>family for protection.
</p>
<p>In 1582 the King and his Court came to dine at

<p>Ruthven Castle ; the Court lords went a-hunting

<p>in the adjoining forests, and on their return were

<p>refused access to the King, who, a boy at the time,

<p>remained for some weeks at Ruthven under the
</p>
<p>careful tutelage of Ruthven and Glamis. This was
</p>
<p>the Raid of Ruthven. But soon thereafter the King

<p>put himself under the direction of Arran and the

<p>hended there by order of Stewart, after a heroic
</p>
<p>defence, and thereafter executed at Stirling, anno

<p>1584. John, Earl of Gowrie, and his brother, Alex-

<p>ander, remained at home till they had gone through
</p>
<p>their studies at the University ; then went abroad to
</p>
<p>Padua to finish their education. On their return
</p>
<p>home in March or April 1600 they came to England,
</p>
<p>visited Queen Elizabeth, and remained some weeks
</p>
<p>at her Court. She ordered guards to attend them,
</p>
<p>and all the honours due to a Prince of Wales to be
</p>
<p>paid to Gowrie, her full cousin, and to be enter-
</p>
<p>tained at the public expense during his visit at
</p>
<p>Court. It cost Gowrie and his brother their lives
</p>
<p>soon after. John, Earl of Gowrie, and his brother
</p>
<p>were youths whom Nature had adorned with many
</p>
<p>accomplishments, to which education had added

<p>elegant improvements. They were more learned

<p>religious than is common at their time of life;
</p>
<p>generous, brave, popular, sincere and gentle; be-

<p>loved by the Protestants of both nations, and re-

</p>
<p>at King James' Court made him soon retire to his
</p>
<p>estates.
</p>
<p>The Catholic party determined his ruin. The
</p>
<p>King's suspicious temper, above all, his jealousy,
</p>
<p>that the Protestants of England would prevail on
</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth to name Gowrie as her successor,
</p>
<p>made him heartily fall in with the scheme of de-
</p>
<p>stroying Gowrie. The question was, how it could
</p>
<p>be done, so as not to raise suspicion and incur the
</p>
<p>blame of shedding innocent blood.
</p>
<p>Archbishop Spottiswoode mentions this matter,
</p>
<p>according to the King's account of it, and the Earl
</p>
<p>of Cromarty seems to have followed him. The
</p>
<p>latter had a family interest in the plot, for his
</p>
<p>mother was daughter to Ramsay the page who
</p>
<p>murdered Gowrie and his brother. These authors
</p>
<p>call Gowrie and his brother conspirators. Their
</p>
<p>narratives have passed so long uncontradicted, that
</p>
<p>what then could be said for Gowrie, is now almost
</p>
<p>forgotten.
</p>
<p>During the reign of the Stuarts none durst openly
</p>
<p>contradict what was said for the King, without the
</p>
<p>danger of sharing Cowrie's fate. It is said for the
</p>
<p>King, that on 5th August 1600, as he was going out
</p>
<p>a-hunting in the vroods of Falkland, he was accosted
</p>
<p>by Alexander Ruthven, who with an air of import-
</p>
<p>ance told him that the evening before he had met

</p>
<p>and his treasure, and without mentioning the matter

<p>a solitary house, and that he thought it his duty to
</p>
<p>make known such a singular event, first of all, to
</p>
<p>his Majesty.
</p>
<p>The King, in his narrative, says that he immedi-

<p>ately suspected this unknown person to be a trafifick-

<p>ing priest, supplied with foreign gold coin in order
</p>
<p>to excite new commotions in the kingdom, and

<p>resolved to empower the Magistrates of Perth to

<p>Earl, his brother, or the Magistrates of Perth, were

<p>bad account of that treasure." (Sir David Dal-

<p>RYMPLE, pp. 4 and 5.) When sport was over the
</p>
<p>King set out for Perth, and when within a mile of
</p>
<p>the town, Alexander Ruthven rode forward to in-
</p>
<p>form his brother of the King's arrival. Whereupon

</p>
<p>attendants sat down to dine in another room, and
</p>
<p>the King being left almost alone, Alexander
</p>
<p>Ruthven whispered to him that now was the time
</p>
<p>to go to the chamber where the unknown man was
</p>
<p>kept. Ruthven conducted the King up a staircase,
</p>
<p>and led him into a small study in which there stood
</p>
<p>a man clad in armour, with a sword and a dagger
</p>
<p>by his side. The King, who expected to have found
</p>
<p>the man disarmed and bound, started at the sight
</p>
<p>and inquired if this was the unknown person.
</p>
<p>Ruthven snatched the dagger from the man in
</p>
<p>armour, and holding it to the King's breast, said :
</p>
<p>*' Remember how unjustly my father suffered by
</p>
<p>your command ; you are now my prisoner ; submit
</p>
<p>to my disposal without resistance or outcry, or this
</p>
<p>dagger shall instantly avenge his blood." The
</p>
<p>King expostulated with Ruthven, and entreated and
</p>
<p>flattered him. The man whom he found in the
</p>
<p>study stood all the while trembling and dismayed,
</p>
<p>without courage either to aid the King or murder
</p>
<p>the aggressor. Ruthven protested that if the King
</p>
<p>raised no outcry, his life should be safe, and moved
</p>
<p>by some unknown reason retired in order to call his
</p>
<p>brother, leaving to the man in armour the care of

<p>Cowrie's attendants entered the room and told them
</p>
<p>the King had just ridden away towards Falkland.
</p>
<p>All of them rushed out, and the Earl in the utmost
</p>
<p>hurry called for their horses ; but by this time Alex-
</p>
<p>ander Ruthven had returned to the King, exclaim-
</p>
<p>ing that now there was no remedy, he behoved to
</p>
<p>die, and offered to bind his hands with a garter.
</p>
<p>Unarmed as the King was, he vscorned to submit to
</p>
<p>that indignity, and closing with Ruthven a fierce
</p>
<p>struggle ensued.
</p>
<p>The man in armour stood as formerly, amazed
</p>
<p>and motionless, the King dragging Ruthven to-
</p>
<p>wards a window  while during his absence the
</p>
<p>King had prevailed with the man with whom he
</p>
<p>was left to open it  and cried with a wild and
</p>
<p>affrighted voice : " Treason, help, I am murdered."
</p>
<p>His attendants heard and knew the voice, and saw
</p>
<p>at the window a hand which grasped the King's
</p>
<p>neck with violence. Lennox and Mar with the
</p>
<p>greater number ran up the principal staircase, where
</p>
<p>they found the doors shut, which they battered with

<p>great fury, endeavouring to burst them open, but

<p>to the apartment where the King was, found the

<p>in the fault." During this scuffle the man who had
</p>
<p>been concealed in the study escaped unobserved.
</p>
<p>Erskine, Ramsay, Herries, and one Wilson, a foot-
</p>
<p>man, who were with the King, thrust his Majesty
</p>
<p>into the little study, shutting the door upon him,

<p>and went to defend the entry by the back door until

<p>the fore door was opened, but as they came to the

<p>head of the staircase, Gowrie, accompanied by three
</p>
<p>or four servants, met them, having a drawn sword
</p>
<p>in each hand. (This he usually carried, being skil-
</p>
<p>ful of that weapon.) One of the four called out :
</p>
<p>" You have killed the King, our master, and will
</p>
<p>you also take our lives? " upon which Gowrie, as

<p>astonished, put the points of his two swords to

<p>the ground, when Ramsay immediately ran him

<p>through the body with a small sword, and Gowrie

<p>THE RUTHVEN FAMILY PAPERS
</p>
<p>las*s history of the families of Tullibardine and
</p>
<p>Stormont, makes a merit of this service done to His
</p>
<p>Majesty; and it is also said for the King, that the
</p>
<p>accidental coming of Tullibardine to the South Gate
</p>
<p>of Perth at that critical moment saved the King
</p>
<p>from imminent danger of being destroyed by the
</p>
<p>mob of the people of Perth ; and Tullibardine did
</p>
<p>not come to Perth, with so numerous a retinue,
</p>
<p>without a cause.
</p>
<p>The King durst not attempt the murder of Gowrie
</p>
<p>in Perth without being sure of such aid. Tulli-
</p>
<p>bardine's coming could be no accident, and is a
</p>
<p>proof of premeditated design. When Tullibardine
</p>
<p>knew what was said he wished the King had ex-
</p>
<p>cused him that service. The two Earls were cousins.
</p>
<p>It was then well known that the King sent for Alex-
</p>
<p>ander Ruthven the night before, or early that
</p>
<p>morning, purposely to give a colour for his going
</p>
<p>to Perth to know where his brother the Earl was, if
</p>
<p>at Perth, and who were with him.
</p>
<p>The story of Alexander Ruthven telling the King
</p>
<p>of the man with the pot full of gold was a mere
</p>
<p>fiction of which there was no evidence, nor of
</p>
<p>Ruthven 's importunate pressing the King to go to
</p>
<p>Perth, for which there was no occasion if the man
</p>
<p>was a prisoner. It is not very likely that Ruthven,
</p>
<p>who knew that he and his brother were not in

<p>favour, would press the King to go to his brother's

<p>the window in the study overlooked. Ramsay and

<p>below stairs, till they heard the King call from the

<p>window. Then was the time they hurried upstairs

<p>was heard to say, " Waes me, poor man, the King
</p>
<p>dead in my house." The story which the King tells
</p>
<p>of the Earl's body not bleeding till a girdle or book
</p>
<p>where he kept some shells was taken off him is also
</p>
<p>false. For more than a hundred years after the
</p>
<p>Earl's death his blood was seen to remain on the
</p>
<p>highest step of the stair where he was killed. The
</p>
<p>corner of Gowrie House, where the staircase
</p>
<p>stood, was pulled down and rebuilt by the Magis-
</p>
<p>trates of Perth, where there are many persons still
</p>
<p>alive who have seen it.
</p>
<p>It is said in the King's narrative that Ramsay,
</p>
<p>Erskine, Herries and Wilson, after they had killed
</p>
<p>Alexander Ruthven, went to defend the entry of the
</p>
<p>back stair until the fore door was opened; but as
</p>
<p>they came to it, Gowrie, accompanied by three or
</p>
<p>four servants, met them, so that it is clear he was
</p>
<p>killed on the top of the stair. Though it had been
</p>
<p>true that Gowrie entered the chamber in arms,
</p>
<p>where he must have seen his brother's dead body,
</p>
<p>it was not treason to attempt to avenge his death,
</p>
<p>and it is acknowledged that Gowrie did not see the
</p>
<p>King, because he was in the study and the door
</p>
<p>shut. The Earl of Tullibardine came in time to
</p>
<p>rescue the King, for the people of Perth were batter-
</p>
<p>ing at the great gate, and threatened to blow them

<p>all up with powder if the King would not send

</p>
<p>land.
</p>
<p>If there had been any truth in the matter of the
</p>
<p>man in armour in the closet, and if he had been
</p>
<p>apprehended and examined directly, it would have
</p>
<p>done much to justify the King; or even if they had
</p>
<p>killed him when they killed the Gowries ; but their
</p>
<p>telling that he made his escape (which it was im-
</p>
<p>possible he could do unseen) throws the scales the
</p>
<p>other way. As the King had it in his power to
</p>
<p>kill Gowrie and his brother, it was also in his
</p>
<p>power to apprehend and give them a fair trial.
</p>
<p>Putting them to death in their own house, and in
</p>
<p>such a hurry, and instead of punishing, awarding
</p>
<p>and promoting the murderers, shows that these
</p>
<p>men were instructed what to do before they came
</p>
<p>to Perth.
</p>
<p>The narrative the King gives of what passed in
</p>
<p>the closet shows that Alexander Ruthven did no
</p>
<p>hurt to the King; and it is no wonder he died
</p>
<p>declaring with his last words that he was innocent.

<p>KING'S NARRATIVE
</p>
<p>answer for themselves. Cowrie's character and that
</p>
<p>of his brother was pure and untainted. The King
</p>
<p>was known both before and after to have dealt in
</p>
<p>such practices : such as the murder of the Earl of
</p>
<p>Moray and the deaths of Lady Arabella Stuart and
</p>
<p>Sir Walter Raleigh. Is it likely that Cowrie and
</p>
<p>his brother could think of making the King a
</p>
<p>prisoner or murdering him, when they knew they
</p>
<p>could not escape condign punishment instantly ? for
</p>
<p>the King and his escort were for the time masters
</p>
<p>of Cowrie House ; Cowrie and his brother were at
</p>
<p>their mercy, and suffered accordingly. The story
</p>
<p>of the man with the pot of gold, and the tale of the
</p>
<p>man in the closet, we have no authority for but the
</p>
<p>King's word, while one who could be guilty of
</p>
<p>such a murder would not hesitate to contrive to
</p>
<p>conceal it; and the King's relation of both de-
</p>
<p>stroyed all possibility of credit. The news of
</p>
<p>Cowrie's death reached Edinburgh next morning.
</p>
<p>The Privy Council ordered the ministers to convene
</p>
<p>their people and give thanks to Cod for the King's
</p>
<p>deliverance, and to read from the pulpit the account
</p>
<p>sent from Falkland by the King of Cowrie's con-
</p>
<p>spiracy ; but the first account translated by the
</p>
<p>Privy Council was indistinct, exaggerated and con-
</p>
<p>tradictory. The clergy, though they offered to give
</p>
<p>Cod public thanks for the King's safety, refused
</p>
<p>to enter into any detail or particulars, or to utter

<p>from the pulpit what neither they nor their people
</p>
<p>believed a word of.
</p>
<p>Gowrie left two brothers in life, Patrick and
</p>
<p>William ; they were privately conveyed the night of
</p>
<p>the conspiracy from Ruthven Castle to Perth, from
</p>
<p>thence in a small boat to Dundee, were put on
</p>
<p>board a ship which carried them to London. Queen
</p>
<p>Elizabeth took great care of their education. They
</p>
<p>were both married before Queen Elizabeth's death.
</p>
<p>When King James came to the Crown of England
</p>
<p>they were both apprehended and kept prisoners till
</p>
<p>their death in the Tower. Their wives were not
</p>
<p>suffered to see them, to prevent their having issue,
</p>
<p>which shows there was no conspiracy, but that the
</p>
<p>King's fear, and Cowrie's relationship to the royal
</p>
<p>family of England, was the cause of the ruin of
</p>
<p>their family. This account is unconfirmed.
</p>
<p>In the matter of the escape of Cowrie's two
</p>
<p>younger brothers, William and Patrick, two lads
</p>
<p>of eighteen and sixteen respectively, we learn from
</p>
<p>the Cowrie and Ruthven papers, edited by John
</p>
<p>Bruce, that their tutor from Edinburgh accom-
</p>
<p>panied them. They procured disguised apparel and
</p>
<p>travelled on foot across the most unfrequented
</p>
<p>districts. They left Dirleton on the evening of
</p>
<p>Wednesday, 6th August. On Sunday the loth

<p>LAST ACT OF THE TRAGEDY
</p>
<p>Governor was overwhelmed with commiseration for
</p>
<p>the young men, and especially for their mother, the
</p>
<p>Countess. He gave the young men shelter till he
</p>
<p>could hear from the Queen, who at once permitted
</p>
<p>them to remain in England. For more than three
</p>
<p>weeks they lay concealed at Berwick, never leaving
</p>
<p>their chamber. The country was so thickly set
</p>
<p>with spies, and the Countess so closely surrounded
</p>
<p>by persons whose business it was to find cause of
</p>
<p>accusation against her, that she dared not send her
</p>
<p>sons help of any kind. From Berwick they tra-
</p>
<p>velled south, on 4th September; and with Eliza-
</p>
<p>beth's consent are said to have resided with their
</p>
<p>tutor two years at Cambridge. They were in
</p>
<p>England, penniless and homeless, when the death
</p>
<p>of Elizabeth placed their royal persecutor on the
</p>
<p>English throne. No greater calamity could have
</p>
<p>happened to the unfortunate young men.
</p>
<p>Now we come to the last act of this tragedy.
</p>
<p>When the dead bodies of the two brothers were
</p>
<p>brought to the Bar of the Scottish Parliament in
</p>
<p>November 1600, it is surprising that the superior
</p>
<p>court of the nation should so easily forfeit the heirs
</p>
<p>of the family, on so slight and contradictory evi-
</p>
<p>dence, which depended chiefly on what Henderson,
</p>
<p>factor to Captain Murray at Scone, deposed. The
</p>
<p>great lords who had been leaders and protectors of
</p>
<p>the Protestant cause were either dead or cut off.

<p>THE RUTHVEN FAMILY PAPERS
</p>
<p>The King got the better of the Clergy, and got a
</p>
<p>number of them to have votes in Parliament. By
</p>
<p>these, the Court interest and the Catholic lords,
</p>
<p>he had a majority. The death of the two elder
</p>
<p>brothers did not invalidate the pretensions of their
</p>
<p>brothers who were in life, which made it necessary
</p>
<p>to destroy them. By this act of forfeiture there was
</p>
<p>no proof of John, Earl of Gowrie, having com-
</p>
<p>mitted any act of treason ; he was killed on the stairs
</p>
<p>of his own house, when his last words showed his
</p>
<p>regard and loyalty to the King. The King could
</p>
<p>not find among his followers any to own he was the
</p>
<p>man in the closet, or that they saw^ him at all,
</p>
<p>because they would not go through that horrid
</p>
<p>scene of perjury which Henderson afterwards did.
</p>
<p>Their making use of him was truly a farce, for it
</p>
<p>is well known and could be proved by a hundred
</p>
<p>witnesses, that at the very time when Gowrie was
</p>
<p>killed, Henderson was seen walking on the Tay
</p>
<p>Bridge at Perth, so could not possibly be the man
</p>
<p>said to be in the closet, and consequently knew
</p>
<p>nothing of the matter.
</p>
<p>The Earl of Cromarty, not at all a reliable
</p>
<p>authority, says that "all this while none knew who
</p>
<p>was the man that was armed and alone in the study
</p>
<p>when the King entered it, and who had secretly
</p>
<p>withdrawn himself when the King and Ruthven
</p>
<p>were struggling; when Sir Thomas Erskine and

<p>THE SCONE ESTATE
</p>
<p>Ramsay entered by the back stair ; and that a great
</p>
<p>reward was promised to anyone who would discover
</p>
<p>him. Thereupon Andrew Henderson, chamberlain
</p>
<p>to Gowrie, discovered himself to the Controller and,
</p>
<p>upon promise of life, offered to communicate all that
</p>
<p>he knew relating to that affair." David Murray,
</p>
<p>the Controller, was one of the persons entrusted by
</p>
<p>the King with the superintendence of this whole
</p>
<p>transaction, and came with him that morning from
</p>
<p>Falkland. Murray got a gift of the Estate and
</p>
<p>Abbacy of Scone, part of Cowrie's forfeiture, there-
</p>
<p>by had it in his power to practise on Henderson,
</p>
<p>who was Cowrie's steward at Scone, and was con-
</p>
<p>tinued in that office by the Controller. By which
</p>
<p>and other rewards and promises ^lurray prevailed
</p>
<p>upon him to become a witness for his Majesty, in
</p>
<p>the case of Cowrie, and own that he was the man in
</p>
<p>armour in the closet, which w^as known to be false.
</p>
<p>He was seen that day coming from Scone to Perth
</p>
<p>on foot, and when he heard the King was in Cowrie
</p>
<p>House and the gates shut, he walked on the Perth
</p>
<p>Bridge till all was over. He owns in his deposition
</p>
<p>before Parliament, in November 1600, that after
</p>
<p>the King left Perth he passed on to the bridge, and
</p>
<p>walked up and down for the space of an hour, and
</p>
<p>this it is thought he said to make it appear that it
</p>
<p>was after the King's departure that he walked upon
</p>
<p>the bridge, because he thought that the odds of a

</p>
<p>few hours would not be perceptible; but this de-
</p>
<p>liberate falsehood helps to show the deceit of the
</p>
<p>whole. Is it possible that if Gowrie had intended
</p>
<p>to assassinate the King he would not have chosen
</p>
<p>a man better fitted for his purpose than Henderson ?
</p>
<p>What purpose could it serve to put Henderson in
</p>
<p>armour, or how could a man in armour escape un-
</p>
<p>seen ?
</p>
<p>It was the latter end of August, nearly a month
</p>
<p>after, when Henderson acknowledged himself to
</p>
<p>be the man, which did no great honour to the cause.
</p>
<p>He was well known to be a base, profligate, un-
</p>
<p>truthful fellow, who had turned off his wife and
</p>
<p>lived with another woman.
</p>
<p>In the end of August, Henderson was first sworn
</p>
<p>at Falkland, and in November following at Edin-
</p>
<p>burgh, before the Scottish Parliament ; but these
</p>
<p>depositions are so contradictory in themselves, and
</p>
<p>so plainly contradict the narrative published by the
</p>
<p>King, that they only serve to confirm the opinion
</p>
<p>that the nation had of the injustice done to Gowrie;
</p>
<p>and that Henderson was not well chosen nor fitted
</p>
<p>for the business he took in hand. His deposition
</p>
<p>and the King's account differ in several particulars,
</p>
<p>first, according to the King's account, " while
</p>
<p>Ruthven was holding the dagger to the King's
</p>
<p>breast the man in the study stood quaking and
</p>
<p>trembling." But Henderson says that " he wrested

</p>
<p>the dagger out of Ruthven's hand." Henderson
</p>
<p>deposed that he boasted to his wife '' that he had
</p>
<p>that day twice saved the King from being stabbed."
</p>
<p>The King asserts that " Henderson opened the
</p>
<p>window during Ruthven's absence." Henderson
</p>
<p>deposed that " he was only attempting to open it
</p>
<p>when Ruthven returned, and that during the
</p>
<p>struggle between the King and him he opened it."
</p>
<p>If we may believe the King, the man in the study
</p>
<p>"stood during the struggle behind the King's back,
</p>
<p>inactive and trembling, all the time " ; but Hender-
</p>
<p>son affirms that '' he snatched away the garter with
</p>
<p>which Ruthven attempted to bind the King's
</p>
<p>hands; that he pulled back Ruthven's hand when
</p>
<p>he w^as endeavouring to stop the King's mouth, and
</p>
<p>that he opened the window."
</p>
<p>By the King's account " Ruthven left him in
</p>
<p>the study, and went away in order to meet his
</p>
<p>brother; and the Earl came up the stair for that
</p>
<p>same purpose." Henderson depones " that when
</p>
<p>Ruthven left the King he believed he did not pass
</p>
<p>from the door." It appears from the situation of
</p>
<p>the house and from other circumstances that there
</p>
<p>could not possibly be any interview between the
</p>
<p>brothers at that time.
</p>
<p>Cromarty seems not to have read the King's
</p>
<p>narrative or declaration, while he differs from, or
</p>
<p>contradicts it, in almost every sentence. He also

<p>says that Dorothea, Countess of Gowrie, was not
</p>
<p>Queen Margaret's daughter, and to excuse himself
</p>
<p>for that groundless assertion, says, he owes that
</p>
<p>genealogy to his friend, George Crawford, to wit
</p>
<p>that Queen Margaret left no children in life to
</p>
<p>Henry, Lord Methven, but that Lady Gowrie was
</p>
<p>daughter to Lord Methven by his second wife,
</p>
<p>Lady Janet Stew^art, daughter of John, Earl of
</p>
<p>Atholl. It appears from the history of the family
</p>
<p>of Atholl, that Lady Janet Stewart was first married
</p>
<p>to Alexander, Master of Sutherland; secondly, to
</p>
<p>Hugh Kennedy of Girvan Mains ; thirdly, to
</p>
<p>Henry, Lord Methven ; fourthly, to William, Lord
</p>
<p>Ruthven, grandfather to William, Earl of Gowrie.
</p>
<p>She had no children to her two last husbands. He
</p>
<p>says that Henry, Lord Methven, married for his
</p>
<p>third wife Mrs Jane Ruthven, daughter to Patrick,
</p>
<p>Lord Ruthven, and sister to William, first Earl of
</p>
<p>Gowrie, by whom he had a son and daughter ;
</p>
<p>and that after his death she married Andrew, Earl
</p>
<p>of Rothes, which could not be, because Lady Janet
</p>
<p>Stewart survived him and married William, Lord
</p>
<p>Ruthven, for her fourth husband. The same Lord
</p>
<p>Methven could not have Mrs Jane Ruthven for his
</p>
<p>third wife, who, as Cromarty says, married the
</p>
<p>Earl of Rothes after his death. Lady Janet Stewart
</p>
<p>was daughter of John, second Earl of Atholl

<p>QUEEN MARGARET COMPLICATION
</p>
<p>so that she must have been married to a former
</p>
<p>Lord ^ilethven, or Cromarty's information is false.
</p>
<p>Mrs Jane Ruthven was second and last wife to
</p>
<p>Henry, Lord Methven, who married the Queen
</p>
<p>Dowager. Gowrie could not marry his daughter,
</p>
<p>and therefore the Countess of Gowrie was daughter
</p>
<p>to the Queen Dowager. It is strange with what
</p>
<p>assurance Cromarty could pretend to contradict an
</p>
<p>absolute fact, and at such a distance of time, on the
</p>
<p>assertion of his friend Crawford. If there had been
</p>
<p>any truth in it, it would have been sooner taken
</p>
<p>notice of, and it is impossible Queen Elizabeth and
</p>
<p>the English and Scottish nations could be mistaken
</p>
<p>in a fact so well known and so generally under-
</p>
<p>stood.
</p>
<p>Cromarty acknowledges that William, Earl of
</p>
<p>Gowrie, and his two sons were in the interest of the
</p>
<p>hot party (which he calls the anti-Christian schis-
</p>
<p>matical spirit in a small party of the Clergy) who
</p>
<p>did propagate that Queen Margaret had other
</p>
<p>children besides Lady Gowrie, that their object was
</p>
<p>to insinuate that Lady Gowrie was a daughter of
</p>
<p>Queen Margaret, and consequently that her son
</p>
<p>John, Earl of Gowrie, was moved to murder King
</p>
<p>James because, as grandchild to Queen Margaret,
</p>
<p>he was nearest heir to the Crown of England.
</p>
<p>Very odd doctrine to be propagated by his friends

<p>against him, but the case was vice versa. It does

</p>
<p>not appear that Gowrie ever thought of it; King
</p>
<p>James had surely the preferable title, and Queen
</p>
<p>Elizabeth would not name her successor. She and
</p>
<p>her Privy Council were too wise not to design it
</p>
<p>for him, and thereby annex Scotland to the Crown
</p>
<p>of England.
</p>
<p>The story of Sprot, concerning Logan of Restal-
</p>
<p>rig, is given as evidence against Gowrie, but
</p>
<p>Spottiswoode's words concerning Sprot show the
</p>
<p>story to be an unmitigated fable, and a mere inven-
</p>
<p>tion of the man's own brain in hope of a high
</p>
<p>rew^ard. Gowrie was too shrewd to trust such a
</p>
<p>worthless man as Logan was known to be, and
</p>
<p>Gowrie and Ruthven could easily keep a secret,
</p>
<p>which never did exist.
</p>
<p>It appears from Lennox's deposition that Gowrie
</p>
<p>said to the deponent " his Majesty was gone up
</p>
<p>quietly some quiet errand," and undoubtedly Gowrie
</p>
<p>thought so, and so did his brother when the King
</p>
<p>called him to go upstairs with him. His intention
</p>
<p>to destroy the brothers was only known to a few,
</p>
<p>who kept it with profound secrecy as well as
</p>
<p>wickedness. No wonder they were well paid with
</p>
<p>grants of Gowrie's forfeiture. Cowrie's going to
</p>
<p>walk in the garden with Lennox, as he depones,
</p>
<p>and staying with him in the close till he heard his
</p>
<p>brother was killed, shows him innocent and
</p>
<p>ignorant of what was doing. Cromarty begins with

<p>fulsome flattery to give a history of the family of
</p>
<p>Gowrie. He makes Walter and Alan, the two first,
</p>
<p>and says they took their surname from Ruthven,
</p>
<p>the place of their residence. Both statements are
</p>
<p>false, for all the ancient names of places in Scotland
</p>
<p>are either derived from the Gaelic or British
</p>
<p>languages. The name of Ruthven has no con-
</p>
<p>nection with either, nor is it Scottish or English.
</p>
<p>Alexander Ruthven of Freeland, second son of
</p>
<p>William, second Lord Ruthven, was father to
</p>
<p>William of Freeland. William was father to
</p>
<p>Thomas, Lord Ruthven of Freeland, and Thomas
</p>
<p>was father to David, Lord Ruthven of Freeland,
</p>
<p>whom the present James, Lord Ruthven, represents.
</p>
<p>It will appear from the records of the Court of
</p>
<p>Chancery that the estate of Gowrie was entailed in
</p>
<p>favour of heirs male, and so were the dignities.
</p>
<p>James, Lord Ruthven, is the only heir of both.
</p>
<p>The family of Ruthven has existed in Scotland for
</p>
<p>above six hundred years, and intermarried with
</p>
<p>some of the miore influential families of both
</p>
<p>nations. It would take a volume to record the
</p>
<p>descendants of their younger sons and daughters,
</p>
<p>who to this day would make one of the most
</p>
<p>numerous in Britain.

<p>at the King's instigation, Earl of Holderness ; and
</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Erskine, Earl of KelHe. This King
</p>
<p>chose those of his own Nation for his favourites,
</p>
<p>who had not one good quahty to recommend them,
</p>
<p>and were in no more esteem in their own country
</p>
<p>than in England. One of the best of them was Sir
</p>
<p>George Home, the new Earl of Dunbar, who was
</p>
<p>the reigning favourite when the King came to
</p>
<p>England, and it is said that he procured that favour
</p>
<p>by concealing what he knew of Gowrie's con-
</p>
<p>spiracy." Sir Anthony Weldon says that '* the
</p>
<p>Scots gave little credit to that story, and the wisest
</p>
<p>of that Nation spoke slightingly and despitefully
</p>
<p>of it." Sir Edward Peyton writes: '* The King
</p>
<p>suspecting the Queen of too great intimacy with the
</p>
<p>Earl of Gowrie, a Lord of comely visage and good
</p>
<p>stature, turned his love and friendship for the Earl
</p>
<p>to the passion of hatred, and caused Ramsay and
</p>
<p>others to murder the Earl in his own house, giving
</p>
<p>it out for a tale, that the Earl with others would
</p>
<p>have killed him ; and to make this falsehood appear
</p>
<p>odious, the 5th August was appointed a solemn
</p>
<p>day of thanksgiving for his supposed delivery, and
</p>
<p>in this he mocked the God of Heaven. He blas-
</p>
<p>phemed God for his pretended deliverance, once a
</p>
<p>year all his life."

</p>
<p>new holiday into the Church of England wherein
</p>
<p>God had public thanks offered up to Him for His
</p>
<p>Majesty's deliverance out of the hands of Cowrie;
</p>
<p>and that fell out on the 5th August, on which many
</p>
<p>lies were told either at home or abroad, in the
</p>
<p>Choir of St Paul's Church or the Long Walk, for
</p>
<p>no Scotsman you could meet with beyond sea but
</p>
<p>laughed at it, and it was said the printed narrative
</p>
<p>of it destroyed all possibility of credit." Dr Well-
</p>
<p>wood, who was a Scotsman, and discreet author and
</p>
<p>well informed of the facts, writes: "Cowrie's
</p>
<p>Conspiracy was in itself so improbable, and
</p>
<p>attended with so many inconsistent circumstances
</p>
<p>that it was disbelieved at the time it was said to
</p>
<p>have been attempted; he then condemns the holi-
</p>
<p>day which Sandcroft and his brethren celebrated so
</p>
<p>devoutly, and for which they held solemn prayers ;
</p>
<p>says posterity has swallowed for truth what their
</p>
<p>ancestors took for a mere fiction." Another his-
</p>
<p>torian, speaking of the printed narrative on which
</p>
<p>the holiday was founded, says: "I will not
</p>
<p>descant upon the many absurdities and inconsistent
</p>
<p>circumstances touched under this narrative, but
</p>
<p>only tell you, most authors who have mentioned it
</p>
<p>turn the tables and lay the assassination at the
</p>
<p>King's door."

</p>
<p>SENTENCE OF THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT REVIEW
</p>
<p>OF THE CONSPIRACY BARONY OF RUTHVEN AND EARL-
</p>
<p>DOM OF GOWRIE CHARTER OF SURRENDER
</p>
<p>The Palace of Falkland, which was then in ex-
</p>
<p>cellent repair, was often resorted to by the King,
</p>
<p>especially at that season of the year, when he was
</p>
<p>to begin his amusement of hunting. A MS.
</p>
<p>written many years ago represents, that in July
</p>
<p>1600, he was there with the Queen and her ladies,
</p>
<p>and a great number of the nobility. He and his
</p>
<p>nobles hunted in the forenoon, and spent the rest
</p>
<p>of the day with the ladies in the amusements which
</p>
<p>were customary at that period. In the King's train
</p>
<p>was Alexander Ruthven, a comely youth, whom the
</p>
<p>Queen highly favoured, and whose age was nine-
</p>
<p>teen years and seven months. Ruthven obtained
</p>
<p>permission to attend his brother John, Earl of
</p>
<p>Cowrie, who about the 20th July, had returned to
</p>
<p>Perth from his hunting in AthoU ; and Ruthven
</p>
<p>did not again come to the King at Falkland, till

</p>
<p>AT FALKLAND PALACE
</p>
<p>the King sent for him late on the night of the 4th
</p>
<p>August.
</p>
<p>The plan for the destruction of the Gowrie family-
</p>
<p>was ripening, and nearly ready for execution.
</p>
<p>Private orders were sent to Lord Tullibardine to be
</p>
<p>at Perth with 300 horsemen in arms, by midday of
</p>
<p>the 5th August. Calderwood states that what was
</p>
<p>afterwards reckoned premature intimation of the
</p>
<p>plot was made to Lady Beatrix by Sir Hugh
</p>
<p>Herries, commonly called Doctor Herries, one of
</p>
<p>the chief actors in that bloody affair. Indulging
</p>
<p>her usual vivacity of spirit, the writer says "she
</p>
<p>laughed at the doctor's bound foot." He, taking
</p>
<p>her by the hand, and looking on the palm of her
</p>
<p>hand, said : " Mistress, ere it be long a sad disaster
</p>
<p>shall befall you." The disaster, in which two of
</p>
<p>her brothers were slain at Perth, happened a few
</p>
<p>days after. It is stated in Stewart's MSS. that on
</p>
<p>the morning of the 5th August, the Queen observed
</p>
<p>the King to be in a hunting dress, earlier than
</p>
<p>usual. She inquired the cause, and he replied that
</p>
<p>he hoped to kill a buck ere the evening.
</p>
<p>At night when he returned from Perth, escorted
</p>
<p>not only by the nobles who had gone along with
</p>
<p>him, but also by the 300 horsemen in arms, whom
</p>
<p>he had appointed to meet him at Perth, and when
</p>
<p>the Queen was told of the death of the Earl and his
</p>
<p>brother, she wept, and applied to that event what

<p>THE RUTHVEN FAMILY PAPERS
</p>
<p>the King had spoken, of his hope of kiUing a buck
</p>
<p>ere the evening. She often afterwards was heard
</p>
<p>to say with tears, that she dreaded the Divine
</p>
<p>vengeance on her family, for shedding the innocent
</p>
<p>blood of the Cowries.
</p>
<p>Lady Beatrix, after the death of her two brothers,
</p>
<p>resigned the office which she held at Court, but
</p>
<p>being naturally of a firm temper, was not so entirely
</p>
<p>overcome with grief as some of her sisters were.
</p>
<p>Lennox was thought to be a principal actor in the
</p>
<p>bloody scene, because of the knowledge which he
</p>
<p>had of the stairs, passages and apartments of
</p>
<p>Cowrie House, Perth ; and because of his acquaint-
</p>
<p>ance and influence with the factors or porters, or
</p>
<p>other servants, whom he might have appointed
</p>
<p>during the Earl's long absence at the University at
</p>
<p>Padua. The Duke, after the King's Accession to
</p>
<p>the Throne of England, was created Duke of Rich-
</p>
<p>mond. After the death of the Lady Sophia, he
</p>
<p>married first an English Lady, then another, but
</p>
<p>none of his wives bore any children to him.
</p>
<p>Though Lady Becitrix had left the Court, she still
</p>
<p>carried on a confidential correspondence with the
</p>
<p>Queen, and sought also to be of use to her two
</p>
<p>surviving brothers, William and Patrick. They
</p>
<p>had fled for safety to England in August 1600, but
</p>
<p>in September 1602, they came privately to Scotland,
</p>
<p>having been encouraged to hope that by the

</p>
<p>Queen's influence, and their sister's policy, the
</p>
<p>sentence of banishment might be removed.
</p>
<p>The King got notice of their arrival, and was
</p>
<p>afraid of a plot, but the Queen dissuaded him from
</p>
<p>using any rigorous measures.
</p>
<p>They were in the country about three months;
</p>
<p>and we are told by Robertson and other writers,
</p>
<p>that one evening in particular, the Lady Paisley,
</p>
<p>wife of Lord Claude Hamilton, and the Dowager
</p>
<p>Duchess of Angus, brought Lady Beatrix to the
</p>
<p>Palace of Holyrood House, disguised as one of
</p>
<p>their gentlewomen, and that she continued with the
</p>
<p>Queen all night, in secret consultation. The
</p>
<p>scheme, however, of procuring the restoration of
</p>
<p>the two voung men was impracticable. Their
</p>
<p>estates were now in the hands of those from whom
</p>
<p>they could not be recovered, and her brothers were
</p>
<p>obliged to return to England in a very poor con-
</p>
<p>dition. The unexpected moderation of the King's
</p>
<p>conduct when he heard of the young men being in
</p>
<p>Scotland may thus be accounted for. We are as-
</p>
<p>sured that the Queen, by some means, had obtained
</p>
<p>from Sir Thomas Erskine, the person who had
</p>
<p>given the last fatal wound to Alexander Ruthven,
</p>
<p>news of some secret information relating to the
</p>
<p>affair at Perth, and that she communicated to Lady
</p>
<p>Beatrix the information she had received. The
</p>
<p>King therefore was afraid that if he should give

<p>them any high provocation, they would divulge to
</p>
<p>the world the circumstances which had come to
</p>
<p>their knowledge.
</p>
<p>About this time the Lady Beatrix was married to
</p>
<p>Sir John Hume of Coldingham (Cowdenknowes
</p>
<p>parish of Earlston). He was a patriotic gentleman of
</p>
<p>great respectability, and was not a young man, but
</p>
<p>had been married before, though without children.
</p>
<p>He did not live long, and Lady Beatrix bore to him
</p>
<p>before his death a son, who succeeded him in his
</p>
<p>estate, and whose son in 1635 succeeded to the
</p>
<p>Earldom of Hume. Lady Beatrix was commonly
</p>
<p>called Lady Cowdenknowes, because in her widow-
</p>
<p>hood, eminently pious, she had no partiality for the
</p>
<p>Court measures of James VI., and perhaps loved to
</p>
<p>oppose him as the enemy of her family. She
</p>
<p>expressed her abhorrence of the violent methods by
</p>
<p>which he was introducing innovations into the Pres-
</p>
<p>byterian Church, and distinguished herself by the
</p>
<p>encouragement and protection which she afforded to
</p>
<p>the conscientious Presbyterian ministers who were
</p>
<p>suffering persecution.
</p>
<p>The following lines show the opinion the nation
</p>
<p>had of the matter : 
</p>
<p>" King James slew Gowrie, justly bore the blame,

<p>King James feared Gowrie, without wit or shame,

<p>Alexander Ruthven taking his part in this tragedy
</p>
<p>so warmly and eagerly besought us ; that without
</p>
<p>the least suspicion on our part we were drawn
</p>
<p>thither and without our usual company. Meanwhile

<p>the said Earl of Gowrie who had been advised of

<p>himself with his helmet, breast-plate and sword,

<p>Sentence of Parliament
</p>
<p>The Scottish Parliament met on 4th November,
</p>
<p>and evidence having been led as to the due serving

<p>of the summonses, the advocate asked instruments,
</p>
<p>having presented the King's Letter of Relaxation

<p>all hornings executed against them at the Mercat

<p>serious deliberation. Among the statements which
</p>
<p>arrest attention is the King's request to the Earl of
</p>
<p>Tullibardine to be at Gowrie House on 5th August
</p>
<p>at midday, the fatal day, with 300 horsemen to
</p>
<p>escort him to Falkland. This request is unchal-
</p>
<p>lengeable and proves to a demonstration that the
</p>
<p>conspiracy was all prearranged. Again, when the
</p>
<p>royal suite was assembled in front of Gowrie House
</p>
<p>to escort the King to Falkland when all was over,
</p>
<p>the King was to give the alarm, according to
</p>
<p>arrangement, that his life was in danger. When
</p>
<p>the alarm was given that Gowrie was slain, the
</p>
<p>Magistrates and people of Perth rushed to Gowrie
</p>
<p>House and a furious mob assembled. The King
</p>
<p>had to take refuge for his own safety, and did not
</p>
<p>attempt to return to Falkland until night, when
</p>
<p>darkness set in and he would be safe from
</p>
<p>personal violence. The Magistrates of Perth were
</p>
<p>entirely ignorant of the conspiracy. It appears to
</p>
<p>have been formed to carry out a tragedy in five
</p>
<p>acts. The first was the murder of Gowrie and his
</p>
<p>companions ; the second was the annihilation of the
</p>
<p>Ruthvens by Royal Proclamation ; the third was
</p>
<p>the confiscation and seizure of the Gowrie estates
</p>
<p>and their division among the conspirators ; the
</p>
<p>fourth was the sham depositions in favour of the
</p>
<p>King by bribed witnesses taken by the Scottish
</p>

<p>the infamous sentence delivered by the judge, who
</p>
<p>should have been utterly ashamed of himself.
</p>
<p>A highly suspicious element was the King's
</p>
<p>escort from Falkland to Perth. Usually when
</p>
<p>Perth was honoured with a royal visit the King's
</p>
<p>escort would be a dozen horsemen. On this
</p>
<p>occasion there was double that number, and
</p>
<p>upwards of sixty people on foot, walking
</p>
<p>in groups of three or four at considerable
</p>
<p>intervals, to avoid suspicion. This exception-
</p>
<p>ally large escort calls for explanation, and the
</p>
<p>explanation appears to be that though the King
</p>
<p>does not make the slightest reference to it in the
</p>
<p>official narrative, we must take it in conjunction
</p>
<p>with his request to Tullibardine for 300 horsemen
</p>
<p>for the return journey ; and a calm survey of both
</p>
<p>leaves no doubt, and can leave no doubt, on any
</p>
<p>unprejudiced mind, that those who formed the escort
</p>
<p>would be summoned some days beforehand, and that
</p>
<p>a conspiracy in these circumstances was a deliberate
</p>
<p>and illegal plot, carried out by six nobles whose
</p>
<p>names are given, while the summoning of the
</p>
<p>escort in advance proves to a demonstration that
</p>
<p>John, Earl of Cowrie, and his brother were
</p>
<p>perfectly innocent of any intention to molest or
</p>
<p>assassinate the King; the King himself being the

<p>aggressor. Then there is the question of the con-

</p>
<p>fiscation and division of the Gowrie estates. It is
</p>
<p>a fatal point against the King that these estates
</p>
<p>were divided among these six men because they
</p>
<p>carried out and accomplished the conspiracy by
</p>
<p>Royal Warrant. This finally and for ever settles
</p>
<p>the point of the King's guilt. The division of the
</p>
<p>extensive Gowrie estates between these men was
</p>
<p>indefensible, and we are not informed if it was with
</p>
<p>the authority of Parliament. Some of their
</p>
<p>descendants are at this day in possession of the
</p>
<p>estates so illegally taken from the Earl of Gowrie.
</p>
<p>Indeed, it was an illegal exercise of the Royal
</p>
<p>Prerogative. Why did the Scottish Parliament
</p>
<p>passively allow it ? Doubtless these men bargained
</p>
<p>for it as the terms on which they were prepared to
</p>
<p>carry out the plot and the murder of the unfortunate
</p>
<p>victims.
</p>
<p>The Ruthven narrative now published takes to
</p>
<p>pieces the hitherto accepted official narrative, and
</p>
<p>the point we have just referred to can leave no doubt
</p>
<p>on the reader's mind that there never was such an
</p>
<p>event as the Gowrie Conspiracy in the whole realm
</p>
<p>of Scottish history; that the so-called Gowrie Con-
</p>
<p>spiracy was simply a basely planned plot of the
</p>
<p>King to assassinate the Earl of Gowrie and his
</p>
<p>brother, and exterminate the ancient and honour-
</p>
<p>able family of Ruthven. The conspiracy was not

</p>
<p>and his brother took place in Edinburgh. Their

</p>
<p>We come now to the political narrative as recorded

<p>in the Privy Council Register.
</p>
<p>The oldest erected lordship mentioned is the
</p>
<p>Earldom of Cowrie comprehending these lands of
</p>
<p>the Abbacy of Scone which had been bestowed in
</p>
<p>1581 on William, Lord Ruthven, on his promotion
</p>
<p>to the Earldom. Although the chief of the Ruthven
</p>
<p>Raid administration, he had forfeited his honours
</p>
<p>and his life in 1584; after the subversion of the
</p>
<p>brief administration by the dictatorship of the
</p>
<p>pseudo Arran there had remained sufficient respect
</p>
<p>for his accuracy among the members of the ministry
</p>
<p>of the Ruthven lords to procure the repeal of his
</p>
<p>forfeiture by the restoration in 1586 of the estates of

</p>
<p>son of the family, a mere youth as yet, was now
</p>
<p>second Earl of Gowrie, with three younger brothers
</p>
<p>about him, and seven sisters  some of them married
</p>
<p>to great personages. Hence the fitness of specify-
</p>
<p>ing that the Gowrie Earldom was almost the chief
</p>
<p>among the erected lordships that was to be left un-
</p>
<p>touched by the Act of Annexation. After the final
</p>
<p>forfeiture of the Gowrie family in 1600 it was again
</p>
<p>erected for David Murray, Lord Scone, and Vis-
</p>
<p>count Stormont, in the Parliament of 1606 and by
</p>
<p>charter of 1608 which includes the priory of Loch
</p>
<p>Tay.
</p>
<p>The famous Abbey of Scone had been sacked
</p>
<p>and burned down in June 1559 by the Reforming
</p>
<p>populace of Perth and Dundee, by way of special
</p>
<p>demonstration of their hatred of Patrick Hepburn,
</p>
<p>Bishop of Moray, who was then its Commendator.
</p>
<p>He had held both offices since 1538, and continued
</p>
<p>his unpopularity notwithstanding he held both
</p>
<p>offices nominally, after the Reformation till his death
</p>
<p>in 1573. The abbey and lands then came into the
</p>
<p>possession of William, Lord Ruthven, Counsellor
</p>
<p>and Lord Treasurer of the King, through the
</p>
<p>Regency of Mar, and subsequently through that of
</p>
<p>Morton, and the Lennox-Arran administration of
</p>
<p>December 1580  August 1582  created Ruthven
</p>
<p>Earl of Gowrie, October 1581. He held the Abbacy

<p>ship, but as incorporated with the Earldom, and he
</p>
<p>continued so to hold it through his premiership of
</p>
<p>the Ruthven Raid Government, which superseded
</p>
<p>the Lennox-Arran rule, and lasted from August
</p>
<p>1582 to July 1583.
</p>
<p>After this fall, and the forfeiture of the Gowrie
</p>
<p>title and estates, by Act of Parliament, in May 1584,
</p>
<p>the abbey lands were granted to David Lindsay,
</p>
<p>tenth Earl of Crawford, from whom, however, they
</p>
<p>were recovered for the Ruthven family before 1587,
</p>
<p>in which year the Commendator of Scone was John
</p>
<p>Ruthven, third and last Earl of Gowrie, then but a
</p>
<p>child. A great family, among the earliest to be
</p>
<p>enriched by a large grant of Kirk lands, had dis-
</p>
<p>appeared from the face of Scotland.
</p>
<p>Since that dreadful catastrophe at Perth, 5th
</p>
<p>August 1600, which remains to this day one of the
</p>
<p>inexplicable mysteries of Scottish history, the Earl-
</p>
<p>dom of Gowrie had been extinct and the very name
</p>
<p>of Ruthven forbidden as blasted and unutterable.
</p>
<p>Those Scots, especially who had followed the
</p>
<p>King's Majesty to England and attached them-
</p>
<p>selves to his English Court, had acquired a hold
</p>
<p>upon him that left but diminished regards for the
</p>
<p>more sluggish compatriots who remained at Scone.
</p>
<p>Then, from July 1583 to November 1585, came

<p>self; and finally, from November 1585 to July 1587,
</p>
<p>there was what may be called the coalition ministry
</p>
<p>of the Restored Lords, consisting of a tolerably
</p>
<p>harmonious combination of their politicians of
</p>
<p>different antecedents and principles, chiefly surviv-
</p>
<p>ing the Ruthven Raiders.
</p>
<p>The Lennox-Arran duumvirate gave way in
</p>
<p>August 1582 before the assault of the Ruthven
</p>
<p>Raiders, and Lennox had to retire to France. The
</p>
<p>Ruthven Raid administration, which superseded
</p>
<p>the duumvirate, was too short even if it had been
</p>
<p>possible for the Hamiltons to bring about their
</p>
<p>return ; and when Captain James Stewart broke up
</p>
<p>the Ruthven Raid Government, and sent its chiefs
</p>
<p>to keep company with the Hamiltons in their banish-
</p>
<p>ment, planted himself in that sole Dictatorship
</p>
<p>which he continued to hold from 15th July 1583 till
</p>
<p>November 1585. Affairs seemed at their gloomiest
</p>
<p>for the Hamiltons, as for all their fellow-exiles.
</p>
<p>In November 1585 there did come the final turn
</p>
<p>of the wheel ; which threw Arran to the ground,
</p>
<p>and brought back the Hamiltons with their exiles,
</p>
<p>to form the Coalition Government, which restored
</p>
<p>lands, and gave something like peace to Scotland
</p>
<p>at last. This was substantially a revival of the
</p>
<p>Ruthven Raid administration. (Privy Council

<p>the Gowrie Conspiracy, occurred at Perth, 5th
</p>
<p>August 1600. In a letter from the King to the
</p>
<p>Council, received in Edinburgh from Falkland be-
</p>
<p>fore ten o'clock the following morning, substanti-
</p>
<p>ally it was to the effect that the King, while hunting
</p>
<p>near Falkland, was induced by Alexander Ruthven
</p>
<p>to go to Perth. A narrative was put forward in
</p>
<p>print by his Majesty's command a month after the
</p>
<p>event.
</p>
<p>At a convention of estates at Holyrood, Ruthven
</p>
<p>whose object palled the convention, by his speech
</p>
<p>against the King's demand for large supplies, and
</p>
<p>the immediate assertion of his Majesty's right to
</p>
<p>the English Throne. The Ruthvens were dead and
</p>
<p>could not be interrogated. His Majesty's letter was
</p>
<p>read to the clergy containing a curious proclama-
</p>
<p>tion and thanksgiving, and Sir David Lindsay
</p>
<p>arriving from Falkland at the moment related his
</p>
<p>movements and reports facts. The clergy remained
</p>
<p>firm in their refusal, refusal to comply with the
</p>
<p>King's letter. If the Earl and his brother had been
</p>
<p>guilty of the alleged treasonable raid, men would be
</p>
<p>readier thereby to doom their name to eternal
</p>
<p>infamy ; meanwhile the matter was disastrous and
</p>
<p>they must forbear. The council accordingly had to

<p>John, Earl of Cowrie : Short Biography
</p>
<p>John, third Earl of Cowrie, was born about the
</p>
<p>year 1578, and was not quite eleven years of age on
</p>
<p>his accession to the Earldom. Care was taken in
</p>
<p>his education that he should be well acquainted with
</p>
<p>the principles of religion, and that his mind should
</p>
<p>be piously disposed towards the Presbyterian
</p>
<p>Church, then established in Scotland. The super-

<p>intendence of his education was committed to
</p>
<p>Robert RoUock of the College, Edinburgh, an
</p>
<p>eminent and pious divine, and author of various
</p>
<p>books. The Earl, says a modern writer, was
</p>
<p>brought up under Rollock, who dearly loved him
</p>
<p>because of his good behaviour, and the virtue which
</p>
<p>appeared in him. His ordinary teacher was
</p>
<p>William Rhynd, a cleric of some learning, who,
</p>
<p>while the Earl lived, continued his attendance,
</p>
<p>always anxiously concerned about the morals of his
</p>
<p>pupil. The Church Records of Perth inform us
</p>
<p>of a William Rhynd, the son of Sir Robert Rhynd,
</p>
<p>a priest ; which Sir Robert had, in the Popish times,
</p>
<p>been chaplain to three several altars in the Parish
</p>
<p>Church of Perth. But the preceptor of the Earl of
</p>
<p>Gowrie seems rather to have been a son of that
</p>
<p>William Rhynd who was the first Protestant
</p>
<p>minister of the adjoining parish of Kinnoull, and
</p>
<p>who along with his parochial charge had the rector-
</p>
<p>ship of the Grammar School of Perth. The Earl,
</p>
<p>after having gone through the ordinary course of
</p>
<p>grammar, probably at the Perth school, went to
</p>
<p>Edinburgh College, about the year 1589. His
</p>
<p>master there was Charles Ferme, who had been
</p>
<p>newly elected one of the Regents, and who then
</p>
<p>began to teach a class. It was the custom at the

<p>College, that the same master carried on the pupils

<p>who had entered his class three years for the study

<p>of the College, it is said the Sixth Class, educated
</p>
<p>under Charles Ferme, was Laureate  that is, capped
</p>
<p>Master of Arts  12th August 1593.
</p>
<p>The schools were nineteen in number. The Earl
</p>
<p>of Gowrie seems to have attended the class in which
</p>
<p>the Municipal and Roman Laws were taught, from
</p>
<p>October 1593 to August 1594, and it is remarkable
</p>
<p>that notwithstanding his nonage, and his being
</p>
<p>only a pupil at the College, the Town Council of
</p>
<p>Perth began in 1592 to elect him as their Provost.
</p>
<p>In 1593 the Earl of Gowrie, young as he was, was
</p>
<p>brought into public notice by his brother-in-law, the
</p>
<p>Earl of Atholl. In the contest then subsisting
</p>
<p>between the Protestant and Catholic lords, the Earls
</p>
<p>of Atholl and Montrose, who were attached to the
</p>
<p>Protestant interest, levied troops, and came to
</p>
<p>Doune Castle with the intention of compelling the
</p>
<p>King to follow their counsels. The King's troops
</p>
<p>opposed them, and Atholl was in danger of being
</p>
<p>slain. But Atholl and Montrose, who had the
</p>
<p>young Earl of Gowrie in their company, afterwards
</p>
<p>made their peace with the King. Gowrie was not
</p>
<p>blamed, because he was only a minor.

<p>On 6th August 1594, the Earl acquainted the

</p>
<p>that same day, attested by witnesses, that they
</p>
<p>would choose him annually as their Provost till he
</p>
<p>should return to his native country. It was long a

<p>practice in Scotland that noblemen and other per-

<p>sons who wished to acquire a character for eminent
</p>
<p>learning, after having graduated at College, went
</p>
<p>for some time to one or other of the foreign Univer-
</p>
<p>sities, where greater variety of instruction was
</p>
<p>expected ; and often afterwards they made what is
</p>
<p>called "a tour of Europe." The University most
</p>
<p>popular at that time was Padua in Venetian terri-
</p>
<p>tory. It was famous for its ten Colleges and for
</p>
<p>the number and ability of its Professors, and was
</p>
<p>therefore the University that the Earl of Gowrie
</p>
<p>was directed to attend. He left Scotland in the

<p>autumn of 1594, taking with him William Rhynd

<p>as his tutor and travelling companion.

<p>They passed through France, delivering letters of

<p>Geneva they visited Theodore Beza, the successor

<p>of Calvin, in the church of that city, and delivered

<p>to have written a dutiful letter to James VI. In
</p>
<p>November 1595 he received an affectionate letter
</p>
<p>from his Majesty in return, who, knowing the
</p>
<p>importance of having Gowrie as his friend, sought
</p>
<p>early to engage him heartily in his service. The
</p>
<p>Earl's answer is in the University Library, Edin-
</p>
<p>burgh, and was published by Sir David Dalrymple,
</p>
<p>Lord Hailes. The letter was in these terms :
</p>
<p>*' Please Your Majesty if the bestowing of great

<p>benefits should move the receivers thereof to be
</p>
<p>thankful to the givers, I have many and extraordin-

</p>
<p>that it has pleased Your Majesty so well to accept

<p>letter, which is a certain sign of lively testimony of

<p>Your Majesty's good favour and graciousness to-

<p>think myself very happy if it should please Your

<p>hundred thousand times more. In the end I pray
</p>
<p>Your Majesty to have me exercised seeing I have
</p>
<p>had the audacity to write again, for not having the
</p>
<p>comfort of Your Majesty's presence. I could not

<p>" Padua, 24^/1 November 1595."
</p>
<p>This letter is in the laboured style of a young
</p>
<p>man of good sense and promising talents, and who
</p>
<p>had passed the seventeenth year of his age. There
</p>
<p>is no just reason to suspect the sincerity of the
</p>
<p>professions it contains. The King at the time of
</p>
<p>the Earl's father's death had not arrived at his
</p>
<p>" perfect age," and, though nominally governing
</p>
<p>the kingdom, was acting under the fascinating in-
</p>
<p>fluence of James Stewart, Earl of Arran, and there-
</p>
<p>fore could not be greatly blamed.

<p>WILLIAM SANDERSON MS.
</p>
<p>To obliterate if possible in the minds of the
</p>
<p>children of William, Earl of Gowrie, every resentful
</p>
<p>remembrance of their father's death, the estates and
</p>
<p>honours which had been forfeited and restored,
</p>
<p>would be impossible. The King was continually-
</p>
<p>giving them tokens of his favour. The daughters
</p>
<p>were in great credit with the Queen, and obtaining
</p>
<p>honourable marriages, and the younger son, Alex-
</p>
<p>ander Ruthven, when almost a mere boy, was
</p>
<p>raised to an office at Court near the King's person.
</p>
<p>About five years and six months of John, Earl of
</p>
<p>Cowrie's short life was spent in foreign parts,
</p>
<p>before he returned to Scotland. It would have been
</p>
<p>satisfactory to have had a detailed account of his
</p>
<p>conduct and behaviour while abroad, and of the
</p>
<p>persons with whom he was chiefly conversant.
</p>
<p>After his death, it was the policy of the Court of
</p>
<p>Scotland to encourage every vague report w^hich
</p>
<p>could be reckoned prejudicial to his character. Two
</p>
<p>of these reports have been propagated, and
</p>
<p>professedly relied on, by some writers, and
</p>
<p>it is therefore proper that they should be
</p>
<p>examined.
</p>
<p>William Sanderson, a writer of no great reputa-
</p>
<p>tion, whose historical work was printed in 1656,
</p>
<p>says : " I have a MS. which relates that in Padua,
</p>
<p>in a fencing school, the Earl of Gowrie caused to be
</p>
<p>painted for his device, a hand and sword aiming at

</p>
<p>a crown." Mr Sanderson does not in any degree
</p>
<p>authenticate this MS.
</p>
<p>George Crawford in his book on the peerage,
</p>
<p>after giving an account of the Gowrie family, says :
</p>
<p>" I have in my hand an authentic copy of the Earl
</p>
<p>of Gowrie's arms, richly illuminated, anno 1597,
</p>
<p>with the name and titles viz. Joannes Ruthven,
</p>
<p>Comes de Gowrie, Dominus de Ruthven."
</p>
<p>The Earl's maternal grandfather, Lord Methven,
</p>
<p>was married to Queen Margaret, sister of Henry
</p>
<p>VIII. But many of the people abroad were perhaps
</p>
<p>not very accurately informed, that the Earl's
</p>
<p>mother, the Countess of Gowrie, was the daughter
</p>
<p>of Lord Methven by his second wife, and not by
</p>
<p>the Queen. They might therefore consider John,
</p>
<p>Earl of Gowrie, as of royal extraction, and next to
</p>
<p>King James VI. as the nearest heir to the Crown
</p>
<p>of England. Indeed, we are told that many persons
</p>
<p>at home, Bishop Burnet among the rest, were long
</p>
<p>under the same impression. The other charge
</p>
<p>brought against John, Earl of Gowrie, relating to
</p>
<p>his education and conduct when abroad, was that
</p>
<p>he had acquired the knowledge of necromancy, had
</p>
<p>used charms or amulets, and held to astrological
</p>
<p>productions. This charge was vehemently urged
</p>
<p>after his death, with a view to alienate from all
</p>
<p>respect to his memory by the ministers of the

</p>
<p>minds of serious Christians. It was also urged as
</p>
<p>affording a sufficient pretext for ascribing to him an
</p>
<p>absurd attempt on the life of the King. Before
</p>
<p>considering in law, how far this accusation was well
</p>
<p>founded, it is proper to take notice of a criminal
</p>
<p>species of folly which too commonly prevailed at
</p>
<p>that period, and indeed for a long time after.
</p>
<p>Astrologers, prognosticators, and pretended adepts
</p>
<p>in the secrets of Nature, abounded in all countries
</p>
<p>and their writings were read by curious persons.

<p>to Christopher Cartwright's Exposition of the
</p>
<p>Fifteenth Psalm, printed in London, 1558, but
</p>
<p>which catalogue was surely annexed by a stationer
</p>
<p>without the knowledge of the reverend author, I
</p>
<p>have counted twenty books under the following
</p>
<p>general description :  Admirable and learned
</p>
<p>treatises of occult sciences, in philosophy, magic,

<p>astrology, geomancy, chemistry, physiognomy,

<p>chyromancy (palmistry). Some of them were
</p>
<p>written by knights and gentlemen, and some of
</p>
<p>them even by a Fellow of Cambridge College. In
</p>
<p>another part of the catalogue is advertised " New
</p>
<p>Jerusalem," in a sermon for the Society of Astrolo-
</p>
<p>gers, anno 1651, also "Divinity; no enemy to

<p>who of the experiments which they exhibited were

<p>scarcely was practised in Scotland. It was pre-
</p>
<p>sented to the Society in 1785 by the late John

<p>Gillies, stationer, in Perth, who was an industrious

<p>collector of curious articles. Besides a great number

<p>of medical receipts in a treatise called " The

<p>Madderty, and which he bequeathed to Dame Anne
</p>
<p>Gordon, Lady Drummond, 4 April 1648."
</p>
<p>Dame Lilias Ruthven was a daughter of William,
</p>
<p>second Lord Ruthven, sister to Patrick, third Lord,
</p>
<p>and aunt to the first Earl of Gowrie. She was
</p>
<p>married about the year 1546 to David, second Lord

<p>Drummond, ancestor to the Earls of Perth. Calder-

<p>wood says " she had a great pearl in her eye and a
</p>
<p>pearl of godliness in her heart and was a jealous
</p>
<p>promoter of the true religion." This pious lady
</p>
<p>probably valued the book because it assisted her in
</p>
<p>prescribing some safe methods of cure to sick and

<p>poor people. After it came into the possession of
</p>
<p>her second son, Lord Madderty, attention was paid

<p>tomary with some malevolent persons to contami-

<p>nate good men as having consulted wizards and
</p>
<p>used magical charms. The Earl's father was so

<p>calumniated, as Spottiswoode informs us, who,

<p>when speaking of his execution at Stirling, says he

<p>was a wise man, but was reported to have been too

<p>curious, and to have consulted wizards concerning

<p>the state of things in future times.
</p>
<p>Yet, adds Spottiswoode, " he was not charged

<p>those who use them. But seeing that the wicked of
</p>
<p>the world said that my Master the Lord Jesus was
</p>
<p>possessed with Beelzebub, I must patiently bear
</p>
<p>when I, a wretched sinner, am also unjustly accused
</p>
<p>by them, who never have delighted in the verity."
</p>
<p>It is no wonder, therefore, that the young Earl of
</p>
<p>Gowrie, at a time when everything that could tend
</p>
<p>to hurt his character was industriously sought after,
</p>
<p>was traduced as his father and others had been.
</p>
<p>In the account of his death published by the
</p>
<p>King's authority in 1600, it is said *' there was
</p>
<p>found in his pocket a little close parchment being
</p>
<p>full of magical characters and words and enchant-
</p>
<p>ment." To these papers a preternatural effect was
</p>
<p>ascribed, for it is added " while they w^ere upon
</p>
<p>him his wound whereof he died bled not, but after
</p>
<p>they were taken away, the blood gushed in great
</p>
<p>abundance." It has been said that the wound was
</p>
<p>inflicted on his back by a small pointed sword, and
</p>
<p>therefore his body at first bled inwardly.

</p>
<p>It is certain, however, that papers, in which were
</p>
<p>written Latin and Hebrew characters, were once in
</p>
<p>his possession. His tutor, Rhynd, was examined at
</p>
<p>Falkland, 9th August 1600, concerning these
</p>
<p>papers. This honest and good man, whose simple
</p>
<p>oath might have been depended on, was put into
</p>
<p>that engine of torture called " the Boots," and was
</p>
<p>so cruelly handled that, as I have been told, his
</p>
<p>legs never afterwards were well. The torment did
</p>
<p>not force from him any declaration which could
</p>
<p>justly tend to convict the Earl of Cowrie. But he
</p>
<p>deponed that, having gone from the Earl for a
</p>
<p>short time on a visit to Venice, he found when he
</p>
<p>returned to Padua, that the Earl had got some
</p>
<p>papers marked with Latin and Hebrew characters,
</p>
<p>which he was carrying in his pocket. He asked
</p>

<p>DEPOSITIONS
</p>
<p>had procured them. The Earl repHed that he had
</p>
<p>copied them by chance ; and when Rhynd would
</p>
<p>have taken them from him, he would not allow it, but
</p>
<p>said : '' Let them alone for they can do you no evil."
</p>
<p>Rhynd had heard that there were persons in Italy
</p>
<p>who gave breeves. He probably meant either exor-
</p>
<p>cisms or Papal dispensations. He therefore often
</p>
<p>would have burnt the papers if he had not been
</p>
<p>afraid of my lord's anger. ^ly lord, when changing
</p>
<p>his clothes, always took care to put the papers into
</p>
<p>his pocket. The Latin characters seemed to Rhynd
</p>
<p>to be of the Earl's own handwriting, but he did not
</p>
<p>know who it was that made the Hebrew characters.
</p>
<p>The papers said to have been found upon the Earl
</p>
<p>having been shown, Rhynd said they were the same
</p>
<p>which he had seen in Padua.
</p>
<p>The Earl of Cromarty in his account of the
</p>
<p>Gowrie Conspiracy says that he once had these
</p>
<p>papers in his custody, but afterwards lost them, and
</p>
<p>that to the best of his remembrance they contained
</p>
<p>magic spells and characters, which none could
</p>
<p>understand but those who practise that art. Nichol-
</p>
<p>son, the English Ambassador at Edinburgh, wrote
</p>
<p>Sir Robert Cecil, loth August 1600: "they the
</p>
<p>courtiers say that upon the Earl were found char-
</p>
<p>acters some for love, some for blood, and some
</p>
<p>contra potestatem Divinae Maiestatis. Contrary to
</p>
<p>the power of Sacred Majesty."

</p>
<p>William Sanderson, in his Scottish History,
</p>
<p>written in 1652, seems to have received the truest
</p>
<p>information. He says a parchment bag was taken
</p>
<p>out of the Earl's bosom, with characters, and these
</p>
<p>letters, put together, made tetragrammaton.
</p>
<p>The word tetragrammaton is Greek, and means
</p>
<p>four letters. It is applied to indicate the sacred
</p>
<p>Name, Jehovah, which consists of four letters in
</p>
<p>Hebrew. It was supposed, when pronounced with
</p>
<p>faith, to be accompanied with a powerful efficacy,
</p>
<p>and was used as an amulet. Probably each letter
</p>
<p>of the word was written on small and separate
</p>
<p>pieces of paper in the Latin, Hebrew and Greek
</p>
<p>alphabets. The pieces would thereby be numerous,
</p>
<p>and would appear mysterious to those persons who
</p>
<p>had not previously learned how to arrange them.
</p>
<p>We are called upon to trust in the Name of the
</p>
<p>Lord, but the precept means that we are to trust in
</p>
<p>the perfection of His Nature, and not in the letters
</p>
<p>of His Name. To use the letters as an amulet
</p>
<p>would be superstitious and unwarrantable, and con-
</p>
<p>fiding in a method of our own devising. Some
</p>
<p>people in different parts of the country are yet so
</p>
<p>foolish as to bear on their bodies or in their apparel,
</p>
<p>charms or preservatives against particular disasters.
</p>
<p>But they are not so weak as to confide in them to
</p>
<p>such a degree as to encourage them to rush into

<p>Gowrie must have been far below that of the rest of
</p>
<p>mankind if, trusting to a spell in his pocket, he had
</p>
<p>ventured to attack the life or the liberty of a King
</p>
<p>in the midst of his nobles, and when he must have
</p>
<p>known that almost every person in the kingdom
</p>
<p>would have loudly called for punishment to be in-
</p>
<p>flicted upon him. The religion in which he had
</p>
<p>been educated, and which he seemed always seri-
</p>
<p>ously to confess, taught him that it was presump-
</p>
<p>tuous to look for the Divine protection in enterprises
</p>
<p>which were rash and inconsiderate ; and impious to
</p>
<p>seek for it in such as were unlawful. The supposi-
</p>
<p>tion, therefore, of his having been guilty of the
</p>
<p>rashness and gross impiety, which his enemies re-
</p>
<p>presented, is to be reckoned untenable and should
</p>
<p>be rejected.
</p>
<p>James Wemyss of Bogie (Fife), the Earl's cousin,
</p>
<p>who had gone with him to the deer-stalking at
</p>
<p>Strathbraan, in Atholl, in 1600, a few weeks before
</p>
<p>the Earl's death, deposed that he neither heard, nor
</p>
<p>saw in the Earl of Gowrie, any appearance of a
</p>
<p>treasonable intention. If he had conversed with
</p>
<p>him about " things curious," he said that some of
</p>
<p>the company found an adder and killed it, which
</p>
<p>being reported to the Earl, he said : " Bogie, if the
</p>
<p>adder had not been slain I should have showed you
</p>
<p>good sport, for I would have made her to stand so
</p>
<p>that she should not have passed away "; Wemyss

</p>
<p>asked him how he could have done that. He repHed
</p>
<p>*' by pronouncing a Hebrew word which in the
</p>
<p>Scottish language means holiness." He did not
</p>
<p>remember the Hebrew word, but the Earl said he
</p>
<p>had put it in practice often before. Wemyss asked
</p>
<p>him where he got the Hebrew word; the Earl said
</p>
<p>he " got it from a cabalist of the Jews, and that the
</p>
<p>Cabala contains words which the Jews had by
</p>
<p>tradition ; which words were spoken by God to
</p>
<p>Adam in Paradise, and therefore were of greater
</p>
<p>efficacy and force than any words which were ex
</p>
<p>cogitate since by Prophets and Apostles." Wemyss
</p>
<p>inquired if nothing more than the word was re-
</p>
<p>quisite; the Earl replied that " a firm faith in God
</p>
<p>was necessary and that all these things were natural
</p>
<p>and no marvel among scholars"; also, the Earl
</p>
<p>said that " he had spoken with a man in Italy of
</p>
<p>whom he had first heard by report that he was a
</p>
<p>necromancer ; but afterwards he was informed that
</p>
<p>he was a very learned man, and a deep theologian,
</p>
<p>and that he entered into dealing with him anent the
</p>
<p>curiosities of nature." The Earl further said '' that
</p>
<p>being one time at music he fell into company with
</p>
<p>another man who, staring him in the face, spoke
</p>
<p>things of him to the rest of the company which he
</p>
<p>never could attain unto or be worthy of." The Earl
</p>
<p>reprimanded him and desired him to forbear these
</p>
<p>speeches. But afterwards having met him again

</p>
<p>in the like company he began to make such speeches
</p>
<p>as be had done before. Whereupon the Earl said to
</p>
<p>him: " My friend if you will not hold your peace
</p>
<p>from speaking lies of me, I will make you hold your
</p>
<p>peace by speaking truth of you." He then told him
</p>
<p>that within such a space he should be hanged for
</p>
<p>such a crime, and so it came to pass. Wemyss
</p>
<p>asked who told him that such a thing would
</p>
<p>happen ; he merely answ^ered : " I spoke it by guess
</p>
<p>and it fell out so." Wemyss requested him to
</p>
<p>beware with whom he did communicate such
</p>
<p>speeches. The Earl said " he would communicate
</p>
<p>them to none but great scholars, and that he would
</p>
<p>not have spoken them to him if he had not known
</p>
<p>him to be a favourer of him, and a friend of his
</p>
<p>house, and who would not reveal them seeing he
</p>
<p>knew they would be evil interpreted among the
</p>
<p>common sort."
</p>
<p>Wemyss does not seem to have been a gentleman
</p>
<p>who pretended great learning. The Earl had lately
</p>
<p>come from a famous University, and appears to
</p>
<p>have diverted himself by making his cousin wonder
</p>
<p>at the knowledge he had there acquired. He was
</p>
<p>ambitious of being esteemed a great scholar. The
</p>
<p>several parts of Natural Philosophy seem peculiarly
</p>
<p>to have attracted his attention, which betrayed him
</p>
<p>into the folly of learning some things which were
</p>
<p>then looked upon as sorceries. The dangerous

</p>
<p>at the concert of music, no doubt deserved the
</p>
<p>punishment which he met with, and of which the
</p>
<p>Earl might naturally enough give him warning.
</p>
<p>The memory of Wemyss was probably not fully
</p>
<p>accurate, when he said that the Earl had told him
</p>
<p>he had often tried the experiment of charming an
</p>
<p>adder. In such a case a cabalistic word could have
</p>
<p>had no effect. But it appears from his deposition
</p>
<p>that the Earl of Gowrie, though he was now rather
</p>
<p>vain of his learning, was of a cheerful temper with-
</p>
<p>out guile, and communicated in his conversation
</p>
<p>what he would not have done, if he had been har-
</p>
<p>bouring in his mind any treasonable design.

<p>obtained a pardon from the King, got by some
</p>
<p>means into his hands a written prediction relating
</p>
<p>to the Earl of Gowrie. He transmitted it to the
</p>
<p>King, and Nicholson, the English Ambassador,
</p>
<p>wrote concerning it in a letter to Sir Robert Cecil,
</p>
<p>22nd November 1600: "One Colville has sent to
</p>
<p>the King the collection (calculation) of the fortunes

</p>
<p>son mentions the same prognostication, and says it
</p>
<p>was found by the Earl of Argyll at Orleans, in the
</p>
<p>house in w^hich Gowrie had lodged, and that it
</p>
<p>further stated that though much loved he should
</p>
<p>fall into melancholy. It probably contained the
</p>
<p>substance of what had been uttered by the danger-
</p>
<p>ous physiognomist, whom the Earl mentioned to
</p>
<p>Wemyss as a person whom he had repulsed at the
</p>
<p>concert of music. This man, however, did not
</p>
<p>calculate the Earl's nativity, who perhaps had never
</p>
<p>shown his horoscope to any person when abroad,
</p>
<p>but read his fortune by staring in the face. Though
</p>
<p>the Earl afterwards committed it to writing, as a
</p>
<p>matter of curiosity, it could give him no encourage-
</p>
<p>ment to engage in any ambitious project, as it told
</p>
<p>him he had to die with a sword in his hand ; and he
</p>
<p>evidently thought it of no importance, otherwise he
</p>
<p>would not have left it carelessly in the house in
</p>
<p>which he lodged.
</p>
<p>These are all the grounds on which, after his
</p>
<p>death, Gowrie was charged with the crime of necro-
</p>
<p>mancy. Patrick Galloway, one of the Court Chap-
</p>
<p>lains, endeavoured to persuade the people in his
</p>
<p>sermon at the Cross of Edinburgh, and afterwards
</p>
<p>at Glasgow "that the Earl of Gowrie was plainly
</p>
<p>proved to have been a student of magic, a conjuror
</p>
<p>of devils, and had many of them at his command.**

<p>Even the pious William Cooper, then one of the
</p>
<p>ministers of Perth, and afterwards Bishop of Gal-
</p>
<p>loway, but who happened not to be in Perth on the
</p>
<p>day when the Earl and his brother were slain, was
</p>
<p>staggered in his opinion by the supposition that
</p>
<p>the Earl had been a practiser of unlawful arts. In
</p>
<p>his sermon at Perth, afterwards at Edinburgh, he
</p>
<p>lamented that he whom they all had loved and of whom
</p>
<p>they entertained a high opinion, had gone beyond
</p>
<p>the compass of godliness. A Latin book also was
</p>
<p>printed at Edinburgh in 1601, entitled ''Ravenorum
</p>
<p>ConspiratiOy^' in which the sin of combining with
</p>
<p>infernal spirits was fully displayed, and the Earl in
</p>
<p>the grossest language accused of having been a
</p>
<p>magician.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all the clamour which was ex-
</p>
<p>cited by the bag of papers said, by the King's

<p>that the body did not bleed till the girdle was

<p>loosed and taken away. Notwithstanding the harsh

<p>opinion which his enemies expressed of what was
</p>
<p>written in the papers it contained, it is not improb-

<p>able that the inscriptions on the papers were noth-

<p>they might be easily mistaken for magical signs by

<p>those persons who were not well acquainted with

<p>have them always in his pocket for the purpose of
</p>
<p>assisting his memory in his favourite study, which
</p>
<p>he had begun to prosecute in the foreign Univer-

<p>The generality of the people of Scotland, and of
</p>
<p>the people of other countries, rejected as incredible,

<p>the supposition of his having been so weak and so

</p>
<p>were, no doubt, some credulous persons, and some

<p>who at least pretended to believe what was alleged

<p>against him. There were thus many believers of
</p>
<p>witchcraft, in which the King had set them an

<p>and is in the direct line of succession.
</p>
<p>John, Earl of Gowrie
</p>
<p>Probably the best and fullest life of John, Earl
</p>
<p>of Gowrie, is that by the Rev. James Scott of
</p>
<p>Perth, published in 1818. Scott was a keen ob-
</p>
<p>server of local events, and has written on a variety
</p>
<p>of subjects, indicating a wide range of study. The
</p>
<p>Cowries were a Perthshire family, John, the third
</p>
<p>Earl, being the last to hold the dignity. He was
</p>
<p>born at Ruthven Castle, Perth, and all the three

<p>174
</p>
<p>JOHN, EARL OF GOWRIE
</p>
<p>Earls, and some of their predecessors, the Lords of
</p>
<p>Ruthven, were in regular succession, and extending
</p>
<p>over a long series of years, chief Magistrates of
</p>
<p>Perth and Sheriffs of the county. The conspiracy of
</p>
<p>5th August 1600 is fully dealt with by Scott, and
</p>
<p>being a great controversial question it will be im-
</p>
<p>portant to hear what he has to say about it. Sir
</p>
<p>William Wallace, who in 1298 was Governor of
</p>
<p>Scotland, discovered that Ruthven, who had been
</p>
<p>lurking in Birnam wood, came to assist at the
</p>
<p>second siege of Perth. Wallace and Ruthven dis-
</p>
<p>guised themselves as peasants and got admission
</p>
<p>into the town. As the reward for Ruthven 's ser-
</p>
<p>vices Wallace made him Sheriff of Perth  an office
</p>
<p>which continued to be hereditary in the family.
</p>
<p>Ruthven married Marjory, daughter of Sir John
</p>
<p>Ramsay of Auchterhouse, and died in 1320. The
</p>
<p>second Lord Ruthven, who married Jane Halli-
</p>
<p>burton, daughter of Patrick, Lord of Dirleton, had
</p>
<p>two sons and seven daughters ; one of them, Lilias,
</p>
<p>married David, Lord Drummond. Her beauty and
</p>
<p>her accomplishments are referred to by Lord Strath-
</p>
<p>allan, and her singular piety and her pure religion,
</p>
<p>by Calderwood, the historian. Gowrie House,
</p>
<p>Perth, was acquired by the Ruthvens by purchase
</p>
<p>in 1527. William, fourth Lord, in 1579 made large

<p>additions to it. At the south-west corner be built

</p>
<p>Alexander, were slain on 5th August 1600. There
</p>
<p>is in the library of the Perth Literary and Anti-
</p>
<p>quarian Society a MS. book with descriptions of
</p>
<p>diseases and numerous medical receipts; also, in-
</p>
<p>formation as to how the planets do reign every hour
</p>
<p>of the day and night, with the nature and exposition
</p>
<p>of the twelve signs divided by twelve months of the
</p>
<p>year. This book originally belonged to Lady Lilias
</p>
<p>Ruthven, Lady Drummond, daughter to William,
</p>
<p>second Lord Ruthven, and aunt to William, first
</p>
<p>Earl of Gowrie, married at Perth, 17th August
</p>
<p>1561. Lord Methven's first wife was Queen
</p>
<p>Margaret Tudor, widow of James IV. and mother
</p>
<p>of James V. His second wife was Lady Janet
</p>
<p>Stewart, daughter of John, second Earl of Atholl,
</p>
<p>who fell at Flodden. If Dorothea, Countess of
</p>
<p>Gowrie, was Lord Methven's daughter by his first
</p>
<p>wife, then her son, John, Earl of Gowrie, bore a
</p>
<p>near affinity to the Crown of England. If by the
</p>
<p>second wife, then young Gowrie was a descendant
</p>
<p>of the Stewarts, Earls of Atholl, and allied to the
</p>
<p>royal family of Scotland. Robert, the High
</p>
<p>Steward, and Walter Stuart, his son, have each

<p>held the Atholl Earldom in the fourteenth and

<p>one and Alexander nineteen years of age. It cannot
</p>
<p>easily be conceived that two men so young in years
</p>
<p>were capable of forming such a deep and traitorous
</p>
<p>plot as has been ascribed to them. John, Earl of
</p>
<p>Gowrie, was believed by all unprejudiced persons;
</p>
<p>and such persons as Sir Robert Douglas seems to
</p>
<p>have had this chiefly in his view, when he says :
</p>
<p>" their youth and peaceable disposition made them
</p>
<p>to be idolized by all who knew them. Nature and
</p>
<p>education had joined in adorning them, especially
</p>
<p>the elder, with the most noble accomplishments ;
</p>
<p>more learning than is usual with persons of their
</p>
<p>rank; more religion than is common in persons of
</p>
<p>their time of life ; generous, brave, popular ; Their
</p>
<p>countrymen far from thinking them capable of any
</p>
<p>atrocious crime, conceived the most sanguine hopes
</p>
<p>of their early virtues." On 28th June 1660 took
</p>
<p>place the execution of David Drummond for the
</p>
<p>slaughter of George Ramsay's man. He was con-
</p>
<p>demned in the first Justice Court that ever John,
</p>
<p>Earl of GowTie, held after his return from
</p>
<p>Padua.
</p>
<p>The plot for the assassination of the two young
</p>
<p>men, Gowrie and his brother, appears to have con-
</p>
<p>sisted of the following parts:  The catastrophe in
</p>
<p>view was, that the Earl and his brother should be
</p>
<p>put to death in a sudden scuffle ; in w^hich, however,
</p>
<p>they were to be made to appear as traitors. The

<p>present safety of the King, and of the persons
</p>
<p>immediately employed, was to be secured by cor-
</p>
<p>rupting some of the Earl's servants; and by bring-
</p>
<p>ing a sufficient number of armed men from the
</p>
<p>country. A specious pretence was to be contrived
</p>
<p>for the King's coming to Perth. The King, after
</p>
<p>dinner in Gowrie House, was to pretend a necessity
</p>
<p>for retiring to a private apartment. A report was
</p>
<p>to be raised that he had gone away to Falkland.
</p>
<p>When the courtiers were assembled in the street
</p>
<p>under the windows where the King was, the King
</p>
<p>was to cry to them from the window that his life
</p>
<p>was in danger. His confidential servants were then
</p>
<p>to ascend a private stair, and kill first one brother,
</p>
<p>and afterwards the other.
</p>
<p>Sir John Ramsay, a page or gentleman of the
</p>
<p>bedchamber, was sitting after dinner in Gowrie
</p>
<p>House, holding on his arm a hawk ; on the alarm
</p>
<p>being given that the King was missing, Ramsay,
</p>
<p>still holding the hawk, which was a present to the
</p>
<p>King, went up the broad stair to the Long Gallery,
</p>
<p>and stood a little while admiring it. When he came
</p>
<p>down to the courtyard he declared that the King
</p>
<p>was not to be found. At the opposite door of the
</p>
<p>gallery chamber, were Lennox and Mar, and other
</p>
<p>courtiers, knocking for admission. They dispatched
</p>
<p>Robert Brown, a servant of the King, to inform
</p>
<p>him that they who were his friends were waiting to

</p>
<p>dead body of the Earl of Gowrie lying on the floor.
</p>
<p>Having delivered his message the door was opened
</p>
<p>to the nobles, and after their entrance, was again
</p>
<p>locked. The affair having succeeded to his wish,
</p>
<p>the King, being in perfect safety, came forth from
</p>
<p>the closet. He knelt upon the floor and all the
</p>
<p>nobles followed his example. The King, who was
</p>
<p>the speaker, praised God for the victory he had
</p>
<p>obtained, and for his miraculous deliverance.
</p>
<p>Another party, who were anxious for the Earl's
</p>
<p>safety, now^ came to that door at the west end of
</p>
<p>the gallery, by w^hich the nobles had entered.
</p>
<p>Alexander Ruthven of Freeland cried through the
</p>
<p>keyhole to Lennox, " My Lord, for God's sake tell
</p>
<p>me how is my Lord GowTie "; Lennox answered:
</p>
<p>** He is well; but thou art a fool; go thy w^ay for
</p>
<p>thou will get little thanks for thy present
</p>
<p>labour."

<p>A treasonable attempt made by the Earl and his

</p>
<p>and when some hundreds of armed horsemen,
</p>
<p>gentlemen from the country, had assembled to be
</p>
<p>ready to defend him, can only be credible on the

<p>supposition that the two brothers had become sud-

</p>
<p>them. They are esteemed and spoken to as reason-
</p>
<p>able men.
</p>
<p>Wednesday, 6th August 1600. The Magistrates
</p>
<p>of Edinburgh intimated to the Clergy the King's
</p>
<p>orders sent from Falkland to offer public thanks to
</p>
<p>God for the King's deliverance. No particulars
</p>
<p>were given of the alleged treason ; and there were
</p>
<p>already reports in the town unfavourable to the
</p>
<p>King's conduct. The Clergy hesitated till they
</p>
<p>should be instructed as to the truth of the matter.
</p>
<p>They were thankful the King was safe, but they
</p>
<p>could not intimate their belief of his being free from
</p>
<p>blame. Indeed, they strongly suspected he had
</p>
<p>been exceedingly guilty. They were immediately
</p>
<p>summoned to the Privy Council, accompanied by
</p>
<p>the Magistrates. The Clergy wished further light
</p>
<p>before they could with a safe conscience declare
</p>
<p>to the people that the late Earl of Cowrie and his
</p>
<p>brother had been traitors. The Clergy of Edin-
</p>
<p>burgh were unanimously of this opinion, Peter
</p>
<p>Hewat dissenting. They were therefore com-
</p>
<p>manded by the King and Council not to preach
</p>
<p>in any part of his Majesty's dominions under the
</p>
<p>penalty of death ; and further, commanded to leave
</p>
<p>Edinburgh within forty-eight hours and not to come
</p>
<p>within ten miles of it under penalty of death.
</p>
<p>They accordingly left Edinburgh, 14th August, and

<p>the town thereby was destitute of all its ministers
</p>
<p>except Hewat.
</p>
<p>After the infamous sentences against Gowrie and
</p>
<p>his brother (the dead bodies) were delivered, Alex-
</p>
<p>ander and Henry Ruthven of Freeland, Hew Mon-
</p>
<p>crieff, brother of Sir William Moncrieff, and Patrick
</p>
<p>Eviot, brother of Colin Eviot of Balhousie were
</p>
<p>also declared traitors and their lands confiscated.
</p>
<p>On Monday, 19th November 1600, the dead
</p>
<p>bodies of Gowrie and his brother were hanged and
</p>
<p>dismembered at the Cross of Edinburgh. The
</p>
<p>heads were fixed on the gable of the Tolbooth, to
</p>
<p>remain there till the wind should blow them off;
</p>
<p>their legs and arms were sent to Perth to be fixed
</p>
<p>above the ports of the town. Such was the melan-
</p>
<p>choly end of these two young men, of whom great
</p>
<p>hopes had been entertained.
</p>
<p>In September 1602, William and Patrick Ruth-
</p>
<p>ven came privately to Scotland to solicit a reversal
</p>
<p>of the attainder. Lady Beatrix Ruthven with some
</p>
<p>Court ladies visited the Queen at Holyrood and
</p>
<p>desired her to use her influence with her husband,
</p>
<p>the King, to agree to this ; but he refused to do so.
</p>
<p>On his accession to the English Crown in 1603 he
</p>
<p>issued a proclamation for the arrest of these young
</p>
<p>men. William escaped and went to the Continent,
</p>
<p>but Patrick was arrested and imprisoned in the
</p>
<p>Tower of London. (Scott's History of John, Earl

<p>and other writers were mistaken in saying that the
</p>
<p>Countess of Cowrie was the daughter of Lord
</p>
<p>Methven by Queen Margaret. The Countess bore
</p>
<p>five sons and eight or nine daughters, within the
</p>
<p>space of twenty-three years.
</p>
<p>I. James; entry in Register:  "Perth 22 Sep-
</p>
<p>tember 1575; Pater, William, Lord Ruthven ;
</p>
<p>witnesses (Godfather) James Earl of Morton,
</p>
<p>Regent, and the Earl of Angus; nomen, (name of
</p>
<p>Child) James Ruthven." The Earl of Angus was
</p>
<p>Archibald Douglas, nephew to the Earl of Morton.
</p>
<p>He was afterwards known as the Good Earl of
</p>
<p>Angus. He joined in all the schemes of William,
</p>
<p>Earl of Cowrie, and was a firm supporter of the
</p>
<p>Protestant interest. He was some time in exile in
</p>
<p>England, and died in 1588. His body was buried
</p>
<p>at Abernethy, and his heart, by his own request, in
</p>
<p>the Church of Douglas, Lanarkshire. James
</p>
<p>Ruthven, the child, succeeded as second Earl of
</p>
<p>Cowrie, after his father's execution at Stirling, 4th
</p>
<p>May 1584. The Town Council of Perth elected
</p>
<p>him their Provost for 1587 and 1588; but he died
</p>
<p>in the end of July 1588, when he was scarcely
</p>
<p>fourteen years of age. He was a youth of great
</p>
<p>hopes, and of a sweet disposition. There is an
</p>
<p>entry in the Session Records of 1637 showing how
</p>
<p>this young nobleman was beloved. Lady Balvaird,

</p>
<p>who since the death of her husband, Sir Andrew
</p>
<p>Murray of Arngask and Balvaird, had continued a
</p>
<p>widow about thirty-four years, died in February
</p>
<p>1637. I^ her early days she had been an intimate
</p>
<p>companion of the Gowrie family. Before her death
</p>
<p>she expressed her earnest desire that her body
</p>
<p>should be buried at the east end of the Parish
</p>
<p>Church of Perth, close to the body of James, Earl
</p>
<p>of Gowrie. John Robertson was at that time
</p>
<p>minister of Perth, and Lady Stormont, applied to
</p>
<p>him desiring that the request of her late mother,
</p>
<p>Lady Balvaird, should be granted, and if so she
</p>
<p>would give a donation to the poor of ;^ioo Scots
</p>
<p>money. The Session granted the request on con-
</p>
<p>dition that the donation be paid before the ground
</p>
<p>was opened. The money was accordingly paid, and
</p>
<p>Lady Balvaird interred as desired. Another part
</p>
<p>of the Session Record certifies that the grave of
</p>
<p>James, Earl of Gowrie, was in the north-east nook
</p>
<p>of the Parish Church  that is, in the north-east
</p>
<p>corner of the East Church of Perth. The large blue
</p>
<p>marble stone still to be seen there had been, as
</p>
<p>appears by the two compartments engraven upon it,
</p>
<p>plainly intended to cover two bodies. The two
</p>
<p>Crowns with which it is decorated are not Earl's
</p>
<p>coronets, but real crowns, which is evident from
</p>
<p>their having the fleur-de-lis. It is probable that it
</p>
<p>had covered the bodies of James L and his Queen,

<p>Monastery at Perth ; and that after the Reformation
</p>
<p>it had been brought from the ruins of that monas-

<p>tery and cared for as a mark of respect to the
</p>
<p>memory of that King. As a mark of respect which

<p>the town of Perth bore to the Cowrie family it had

<p>been laid on the grave of the young Earl in 1588.
</p>
<p>2. John, third Earl of Cowrie. His baptism is
</p>
<p>not mentioned in the Perth Register. Perhaps he
</p>
<p>was born at Ruthven Castle, or at Edinburgh,
</p>
<p>while his father was attending Parliament, or at
</p>
<p>the family seat at Dirleton, East Lothian. As he
</p>
<p>was not fully twenty-two years of age at the time of
</p>
<p>his death in 1600, it is probable he was born in
</p>
<p>1578. He succeeded his brother, James, in 1588,
</p>
<p>as third Earl of Cowrie, when ten years of age.
</p>
<p>3. Alexander Ruthven was born at Perth, and his
</p>
<p>baptism is thus recorded:  "Perth 22 January

<p>1580-81. Pater, William, Lord Ruthven ; witnesses

<p>(Codfather) Earl of AthoU and Alexander, Lord

</p>
<p>months before had been married to the Queen's

<p>When very young he attended Court, and was one

<p>He was very handsome, and a great favourite of

<p>the King and Queen. The Queen loved pomp and

<p>young Ruthven, and therefore he determined to

<p>destroy him.
</p>
<p>Alexander Ruthven was killed along with his
</p>
<p>brother the Earl, at Perth, August 1600, when he
</p>
<p>received his last deadly wound on the stair of the
</p>
<p>round tower of Gowrie House, and when fallen
</p>
<p>down, he turned his face and said : " Alas, I am not
</p>
<p>to blame," which he could not truly have said, if
</p>
<p>he had before attempted to kill the King, or to bind
</p>
<p>him as a prisoner. His age at the time of his death
</p>
<p>was nineteen years and seven months.
</p>
<p>4. William Ruthven. There is nothing in the
</p>
<p>Register at Perth relating to this son of William,
</p>
<p>Earl of Gowrie. He was probably born at Dirleton
</p>
<p>in 1582. At the time of the death of his two elder
</p>
<p>brothers he must have been eighteen years of age.

<p>FAMILY HISTORY
</p>
<p>John, Earl of Gowrie*s father's name was William,
</p>
<p>who had no brother of the same name. It is pos-
</p>
<p>sible the historian meant either John, Earl of
</p>
<p>Cowrie's cousin William, son of Alexander of
</p>
<p>Freeland, or the Earl's own brother William. It is
</p>
<p>evident, however, from the King's having written
</p>
<p>such a letter that he had meditated a visit to Perth,
</p>
<p>and did not come merely on a sudden invitation he
</p>
<p>had received on the morning of 5th August. The
</p>
<p>young man, William Ruthven, was then at the
</p>
<p>house of Dirleton, with the Countess, his mother,
</p>
<p>and with his younger brother, Patrick, and if he
</p>
<p>had come to meet the King at Perth he inevitably
</p>
<p>would have shared the same fate with his two elder
</p>
<p>brothers. The historian further says that on the
</p>
<p>evening of 6th August 1600, the Master and Sir
</p>
<p>James Sandilands and some horsemen rode to Dirle-
</p>
<p>ton to arrest the two young brothers of the Earl of
</p>
<p>Gowrie, William and Patrick. But they had escaped
</p>
<p>half-an-hour before, having been informed, by one
</p>
<p>of the name of Kennedy, of the danger they were
</p>
<p>in. The Countess, their mother, behaved herself
</p>
<p>soberly till it was said no evil should betide them,
</p>
<p>only, they should be committed to the keeping of
</p>
<p>the Earl of Montrose, Chancellor of the Kingdom.
</p>
<p>She then burst forth with these words : *' Ah ! Ah !
</p>
<p>false traitor, thief, shall my bairns come into his
</p>
<p>hands." The son and heir of this Earl of Mon-

</p>
<p>married to one of her daughters. But the Earl now
</p>
<p>appeared so much on the side of the King, against
</p>
<p>her family, that she was provoked to use these
</p>
<p>words.
</p>
<p>The Countess never afterwards saw her two sons ;
</p>
<p>they had fled into England. The Scottish Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment in 1600, disinherited them, and banished them
</p>
<p>from Scotland. William did not remain long in
</p>
<p>England, but went to foreign parts, and nothing
</p>
<p>further can be added concerning him except Bishop
</p>
<p>Burnet's remark that '' William lived beyond seas,
</p>
<p>became a great chemist and being addicted to
</p>
<p>alchemy it was given out that he had found the
</p>
<p>Philosopher's Stone."
</p>
<p>5. Patrick Ruthven. There is no mention made
</p>
<p>of him in the Parish Register at Perth. Patrick, if
</p>
<p>he was not a posthumous child, may have been
</p>
<p>born in 1583, and therefore in 1600 may have been
</p>
<p>about seventeen years of age.
</p>
<p>After he and his brother fled to England, Theo-
</p>
<p>dore Beza, the successor of Calvin at Geneva, in-
</p>
<p>vited them to come to him, and offered to befriend
</p>
<p>them to the utmost of his power. William probably
</p>
<p>availed himself of this invitation when he went
</p>
<p>abroad, but Patrick remained in England and
</p>
<p>showed an inclination to study physic. On James

</p>
<p>In the Tower, however, he prosecuted his studies,
</p>
<p>and improved himself in various branches of learn-
</p>
<p>ing. King Charles I. released him, and settled on
</p>
<p>him a small yearly pension. William Sandeman
</p>
<p>says " he now in 1652 walks the streets as a poor

<p>gentleman, but with experience in chemical physic,

<p>and other parts of learning," and Crawford adds:

<p>*' Dr Patrick Ruthven left a daughter, who was

<p>married to Sir Anthony Vandyck the famous
</p>
<p>Painter."
</p>
<p>The daughters of William, Earl of Cowrie, were
</p>
<p>great ladies and honourably married. No prejudice
</p>
<p>seems to have been entertained against them, not-
</p>
<p>withstanding the forfeiture of the male issue. The

<p>births of only three of them are recorded in the

<p>I. Mary Ruthven. Her parents were married

<p>17th August 1561. In that same month, Queen
</p>
<p>Mary arrived in Scotland from France; and about
</p>
<p>the month of August 1562, if not earlier, Mary
</p>
<p>Ruthven was born. Her marriage is recorded at
</p>
<p>Perth in these words : " Perth 24 January 1579-80,

<p>died young, and four daughters. The eldest of the
</p>
<p>daughters, Lady Dorothea Stewart, afterwards be-
</p>
<p>came heiress of Atholl. The Earl and Countess
</p>
<p>had a house in Perth on the west side of the Spey-
</p>
<p>gate. The Earl died in that house, 30th August
</p>
<p>1594; and it is said in "Mercer's Chronicle,**
</p>
<p>*'John, Earl of Atholl deceased in Perth on the
</p>
<p>last day of August 1594." He was honourably
</p>
<p>conveyed to Dunkeld, and buried there on nth
</p>
<p>September thereafter. The Queen's Majesty (Anne
</p>
<p>of Denmark) being in Perth in William Hall's fore
</p>
<p>chamber, beneath the Cross, beheld the procession.
</p>
<p>The Countess did not very long remain a widow.
</p>
<p>She married as her second husband, John Stewart,
</p>
<p>Lord Innermeath, who in 1596 was created Earl of
</p>
<p>Atholl. There was no issue of this marriage. Her
</p>
<p>daughter, Lady Dorothea Stewart, was married to
</p>
<p>Sir William Murray, son of John, Lord Tulli-
</p>
<p>bardine. The marriage appears in the Register as
</p>
<p>follows:  "July 1604 William Murray, Master of
</p>
<p>Tullibardine, and Lady Dorothea Stewart, daughter
</p>
<p>of John, late Earl of Atholl." The Countess was
</p>
<p>much displeased with this marriage. Murray, and
</p>
<p>others of the surname of Murray, had greatly
</p>
<p>assisted the King at the time when her two
</p>
<p>brothers, John and Alexander, were slain. William

</p>
<p>He also was obnoxious to the Countess, because
</p>
<p>both in his sermon, and in conversation, in his zeal
</p>
<p>for the King, he had endeavoured to prejudice the
</p>
<p>character of her brothers. The marriage she knew
</p>
<p>could not be dissolved, but she sought to be
</p>
<p>avenged on Cooper, by entering a complaint against
</p>
<p>him to the Elders of Session at Perth. The Session
</p>
<p>Record has the following:  " Perth i6 July 1604,
</p>
<p>the Elders present; which day anent the complaint
</p>
<p>given in by Lady ]\Iary Ruthven, Countess of
</p>
<p>Atholl, upon William Cooper, Minister of Perth,
</p>
<p>touching the contracting by him of Dorothea
</p>
<p>Stewart her eldest daughter, with William Murray,
</p>
<p>Master of Tullibardine, without the consent of the
</p>
<p>said noble Lady, and her friends, as the complaint
</p>
<p>bears. The complaint was read and William
</p>
<p>Cooper having given answer thereto, w^as removed
</p>
<p>from the Bar. The Session unanimously find
</p>
<p>Cooper's proceeding to have been orderly, and
</p>
<p>approve and allow the same." It was in conse-
</p>
<p>quence of this marriage that the ancient surname
</p>
<p>of Stewart in the Atholl family was changed to that
</p>
<p>of Murray.
</p>
<p>2. Isabella Ruthven. She has been said, but
</p>
<p>without authority, to have been the first child of the
</p>
<p>Earl and Countess of Cowrie, and her name has
</p>
<p>even been altered from Isabella to Elizabeth. Such
</p>
<p>inaccuracies often occur in the genealogical table.

<p>Her marriage probably took place in 1580. Her
</p>
<p>husband was Sir Robert Gordon of Lochinver,
</p>
<p>ancestor of the Viscounts of Kenmure. In his
</p>
<p>younger days he was celebrated for his great bodily
</p>
<p>strength, and for his bravery and courage. But
</p>
<p>his acts of valour against the inhabitants of Annan-
</p>
<p>dale, who had provoked his resentment, were tinc-
</p>
<p>tured with cruelty and lawless violence. He received
</p>
<p>a full pardon from the King about the year 1601,
</p>
<p>after which he lived peaceably, and died an old man
</p>
<p>in 1628. His son by the Lady Isabella, alias Eliza-
</p>
<p>beth, or perhaps Catherine, Ruthven, was created
</p>
<p>Viscount Kenmure in 1633. [The statement that
</p>
<p>Lady Isabella married, secondly, George Loudon
</p>
<p>is not confirmed.]
</p>
<p>3. Jean Ruthven. It was probably about the year
</p>
<p>1583 that this lady was married to James, seventh
</p>
<p>Lord Ogilvie of Airlie. Their son, James, was
</p>
<p>created Earl of Airlie in 1639.
</p>
<p>4. Sophia Ruthven. It was probably in 1591
</p>
<p>that Lady Sophia Ruthven was married to
</p>
<p>Ludovic Stuart, second Duke of Lennox. This
</p>
<p>nobleman was with the King at Perth, when John,
</p>
<p>Earl of Gowrie, and his brother were slain. After
</p>
<p>the King succeeded to the Crown of England, the
</p>
<p>Duke of Lennox was created, in that country, Duke
</p>
<p>of Richmond. The Duchess Sophia having died a

<p>afterwards married in England, but had no issue
</p>
<p>by any of his wives. He died in 1624. (By the
</p>
<p>King's order Lady Sophia was secluded, before
</p>
<p>her marriage, at Easter Wemyss, to be out of
</p>
<p>Lennox's reach, but Lennox found his way there
</p>
<p>and carried her off, travelling on horseback all
</p>
<p>night, and was married next day, 19th April 1591.)
</p>
<p>5. Margaret Ruthven. Some time before 1600
</p>
<p>Lady Margaret was married to John Graham, who
</p>
<p>in 1608 succeeded his father, the Chancellor, as
</p>
<p>fourth Earl of Montrose. By this marriage there
</p>
<p>was issue : one son and four daughters. Their son,
</p>
<p>in the time of Charles IL, was the famous Marquis
</p>
<p>of Montrose.
</p>
<p>The Register certifies that their youngest
</p>
<p>daughter. Lady Beatrix, was born and baptised in
</p>
<p>Perth. The entry is as follows :  " Perth 7 March
</p>
<p>161 5. Pater, Earl of Montrose. Witnesses (God-
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>mond, third Lord Madderty. About three years
</p>
<p>after this, the Countess died, as per Mercer's
</p>
<p>Chronicle, 15th April 1618, and was buried at
</p>
<p>Aberuthven. Whether the Douglas Peerage, which
</p>
<p>calls her Margaret, or the Diurnal, which calls her
</p>
<p>Elizabeth, is right, the Montrose family records
</p>
<p>alone can determine. The Earl died in 1626.

<p>death of his father, David, in 1571. The other

<p>and brother to the Countess of Gowrie. He died

<p>shortly after the date just named, March 1571-72.
</p>
<p>On the third day of March, Henry Stewart, Lord

<p>Leith, and was taken to Methven to be buried there,

<p>2ist March 1572. (Mercer's Chronicle.) Sir

<p>William Kirkcaldy of Grange was at that time
</p>
<p>Governor of Edinburgh Castle. He was defending
</p>
<p>it on behalf of the Queen, against the faction of the

<p>THE RUTHVEN FAMILY PAPERS
</p>
<p>died young, leaving a son, who in 1635 succeeded
</p>
<p>to the Earldom of Hume. Lady Coldingham, in
</p>
<p>her widowhood and in the latter part of her life,
</p>
<p>was uncommonly pious. She expressed her re-
</p>
<p>ligious zeal, and openly disapproved of the violent
</p>
<p>methods by which King James VI. was introducing
</p>
<p>innovations into the Presbyterian Church. She en-
</p>
<p>couraged and protected, as much as she was able,
</p>
<p>the persecuted and conscientious ministers who were
</p>
<p>living at that period. One of these ministers was
</p>
<p>Andrew or Alexander Simpson of Dryburgh and
</p>
<p>Merton, places on the Tweed, and in her neighbour-
</p>
<p>hood. He had spoken freely against the Five
</p>
<p>Articles of Perth, in a sermon which he preached
</p>
<p>in Greyfriars Church, Edinburgh, 22nd July 162 1 ;
</p>
<p>and thereupon, by order of the Privy Council, was
</p>
<p>committed a prisoner to the Castle of Dumbarton,
</p>
<p>and was not released until October following.
</p>
<p>Simpson on one occasion said to his wife he was
</p>
<p>going to pay a visit to Lady Coldingham at Cold-
</p>
<p>ingham Castle, when she requested him to ask the
</p>
<p>lady for some straw for their cows. Simpson and
</p>
<p>his man set out for the Castle, and made a comfort-
</p>
<p>able visit. When going away Lady Coldingham
</p>
<p>accompanied him to the gate. Turning to the lady
</p>
<p>he told her his wife's message. The lady said : ** I
</p>
<p>have really now no straw but I have hay and some
</p>
<p>of it shall be sent.'* " Oh no, Madam," said Simp-

</p>
<p>simplicity, and said : '' Mr Simpson, you are indeed
</p>
<p>very ignorant of worldly matters ; do you not know
</p>
<p>that these your cows will love better to eat hay than
</p>
<p>straw." He owned his ignorance, and the lady
</p>
<p>ordered the hay to be sent.
</p>
<p>Lady Beatrix was one of the youngest of the eight
</p>
<p>daughters of William, Earl of Gowrie. He was
</p>
<p>beheaded at Stirling, 4th May 1584, but his estates
</p>
<p>and honours, after having been forfeited, were in
</p>
<p>the following year restored to the family. His
</p>
<p>children were religiously educated and greatly
</p>
<p>esteemed. Some of them were favourites at Court.
</p>
<p>Lady Beatrix and one of her sisters were maids of
</p>
<p>honour to Anne of Denmark, wife of James VL
</p>
<p>Alexander, her second brother, was early ap-
</p>
<p>pointed one of the King's pages, and Lady Beatrix
</p>
<p>in her attendance at Court was distinguished as
</p>
<p>being the Queen's chief confidante. The Queen
</p>
<p>loved pomp and intrigue and masked balls. She is
</p>
<p>reckoned to have been chaste, but she was a great
</p>
<p>admirer of fine young men, and took pleasure in
</p>
<p>their company. The King's jealousy was some-
</p>

<p>THE RUTHVEN FAMILY PAPERS
</p>
<p>The tragic death of the Earl of Moray in 1592,
</p>
<p>who was reputed the handsomest man of his time,
</p>
<p>celebrated in song as " the Queen's love," was
</p>
<p>generally ascribed by the people to the King's
</p>
<p>jealousy; and afterwards, in 1600, the no less tragic
</p>
<p>death of Alexander Ruthven, was by many at the
</p>
<p>time ascribed to the same cause.
</p>
<p>It would appear, from a grant of Malcolm IV.,
</p>
<p>that the Earldom of Gowrie was then of the King's
</p>
<p>proper inheritance. The Ruthven family, which for
</p>
<p>a short time enjoyed it after the dissolution of the
</p>
<p>religious houses, proves its early pedigree mainly
</p>
<p>from the chartulary of Scone.
</p>
<p>The later history comprises the two generations
</p>
<p>of Earls; more romance and mystery than have
</p>
<p>fallen to the lot of any name in the Scots
</p>
<p>Peerage. On the forfeiture of the Earl of Gowrie,
</p>
<p>David Murray, Viscount Stormont, obtained a
</p>
<p>grant of the estates and abbacy of Scone.
</p>
<p>By the wreck of the buildings of the monastery
</p>
<p>and ancient palace of Scone, probably very little
</p>
<p>survived the storm of the Reformation. The house
</p>
<p>used by the successive Commendators was almost
</p>
<p>entirely removed to make way for the residence of
</p>
<p>the Earl of Mansfield. (Cosmo Innes.)
</p>
<p>A coloured illustration of the " Ruthven " tartan is shown in
</p>
<p>the " Vestiarium Scoticuni," the oldest published work containing
</p>
<p>illustrations of the tartans. This book was published in 1842,
</p>
<p>and was compiled by John Sobicski Stuart from manuscript copy

<p>KING'S PROCLAMATION
</p>
<p>On 27th April 1603, there is recorded the follow-
</p>
<p>ing:
</p>
<p>Proclamation by the King : for the Arrest of
</p>
<p>William and Patrick Ruthven
</p>
<p>Whereas the King's Majesty is informed that
</p>
<p>William and Patrick Ruthven two brethren to the
</p>
<p>late Earl of Gowrie (a dangerous traitor to his per-
</p>
<p>son) have crept into this Kingdom with malicious
</p>
<p>hearts against him, disguising themselves in secret
</p>
<p>places where he is informed that they not only
</p>
<p>uttered cankered speeches against him, but are
</p>
<p>practising and contriving dangerous plots, and
</p>
<p>found in the Scots College, Douay, France, and supposed to have
</p>
<p>been written by a Sir Richard Urquhart about the beginning of
</p>
<p>the sixteenth century. This manuscript was presented to Prince
</p>
<p>Charles Edward Stuart between 1749 and 1754, and eventually
</p>
<p>came into the possession of John Sobieski Stuart, who was a
</p>
<p>descendant of Prince Charlie.
</p>
<p>The " Vestiarium " illustrates : 
</p>
<p>25 Tartans of " The Chieff Hieland Clannes "
</p>
<p>II Tartans of " The lesser families or houses "
</p>
<p>30 Tartans "belonging to the low Countrye pairtes and
</p>
<p>Bordour Clannes "
</p>
<p>9 Tartans " of the Bardour Clannes."
</p>
<p>The *' Ruthven " appears under the third heading, which simply
</p>
<p>means tartans belonging to the south of Scotland and Border
</p>
<p>Clans, and it has proved beyond doubt that there were Border
</p>
<p>Clans as well as Highland Clans.
</p>
<p>The description given is as follows : 
</p>
<p>" The Ruthven has one mixed sett and one scarlet, whereof the
</p>
<p>first has to the outside one wide blue stripe and white on the green
</p>
<p>sett, and in the middle of the scarlet two stripes of green."
