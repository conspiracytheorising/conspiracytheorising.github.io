</p>
<p>PREFACE.
</p>
<p>The original intention of the Reporters was to have published
</p>
<p>a full Report of the Trial, with only short notes of the deci-
</p>
<p>sions of the Court on the several motions made in the course
</p>
<p>of Michaelmas Term, 1843. After a considerable part of the
</p>
<p>work had been printed, at the suggestion of several gentle-
</p>
<p>men of the Bar, they resolved on publishing a report of
</p>
<p>the arguments and judgments on the preliminary motions.
</p>
<p>In consequence of this alteration in the original plan of the
</p>
<p>Report, the pages from 25 to 120, are duplicates. In order
</p>
<p>to prevent confusion, and to afford a facility of reference, the
</p>
<p>duplicate numbers have been printed with an asterisk. The
</p>
<p>Reporters avail themselves of this opportunity of acknow-
</p>
<p>ledging the urbanity and kindness of the Lord Chief Justice,
</p>
<p>and the other Judges of the Court ; and to the Counsel em-
</p>
<p>ployed, they have also to express their obligations for the
</p>
<p>assistance afforded them.
</p>
<p>April 13, 1844.

<p>QUEEN'S BENCH.
</p>
<p>REPORT
</p>
<p>OF
</p>
<p>THE PROCEEDINGS
</p>
<p>IN THE CASE OF
</p>
<p>THE QUEEN v. O'CONNELL AND OTHERS,
</p>
<p>&c. &c.
</p>
<p>In the month of October, 1843, warrants having been issued against
</p>
<p>several gentlemen, charging them with a misdemeanor in exciting
</p>
<p>discontent and disaffection among Her Majesty's subjects, &c. ; they
</p>
<p>attended before Mr. Justice Burton at his residence, and gave bail
</p>
<p>to appear in the Queen's Bench, on the first day of the ensuing
</p>
<p>Michaelmas Term.
</p>
<p>THURSDAY, November 2nd.
</p>
<p>This being the first day of Michaelmas Term, the following pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings took place : 
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Burton entered thecourtat one o'clock. The Clerk
</p>
<p>of the Crown then proceeded to call over the grand jury panel.
</p>
<p>George Frederick Brooke, Esq., who was the first who answered
</p>
<p>to his name, objected to being the Foreman, on the ground that it
</p>
<p>would interfere with his duties as one of the Directors of the Bank of
</p>
<p>Ireland.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General.  The usual course is, that the first grand
</p>
<p>juror who answers to his name is the Foreman. It is irregular to
</p>
<p>select a Foreman from the Grand Jury panel. In Mr. Brooke's case
</p>
<p>there is no legal objection whatever, neither privilege nor disability.
</p>
<p>I wish that the regular course should be adopted in this case.

</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Grand Jury of the county of the city of Dub-
</p>
<p>lin, I not aware of any ordinary business of the county of the city
</p>
<p>of Dublin on which it is necessary for me to make any particular
</p>
<p>observations. If any difficulty in discharge of any particular duty
</p>
<p>should occur to you, the Court will be ready to give you, at any
</p>
<p>time, any advice or assistance in their power. But, gentlemen, you
</p>
<p>are yourselves, I am sure, well aware that there is a matter likely, I
</p>
<p>believe I may say certainly, to be brought before you of very great
</p>
<p>anxiety, and of very great public importance, and upon that I think
</p>
<p>it my duty, as summarily as the circumstances of such a subject will

</p>
<p>admit of, to lay such observations before you as, I hope, may some-
</p>
<p>what facilitate the discharge of that very important  but, perhaps,
</p>
<p>you may find it not very difficult  duty which you have to discharge.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the case to which I allude is the subject of an indictment
</p>
<p>which is likely to be referred to you ; and I have to state to you,
</p>
<p>what perhaps you are perfectly well acquainted with without any
</p>
<p>information from me, that such an indictment, even when found, is
</p>
<p>only an accusation against which the party accused is then, that is,
</p>
<p>after the bill has been found by the Grand Jury, called on to make his
</p>
<p>defence. The Grand Jury are, therefore, only to hear the. evidence
</p>
<p>in support of the prosecution ; that evidence is to be given on oath,
</p>
<p>by witnesses brought before them, and they are not only to hear the
</p>
<p>evidence so given, but also so far as they find it necessary, to cross-
</p>
<p>examine the witnesses who may be produced to them, so as to euable
</p>
<p>them to form a satisfactory judgment upon their credit. If, on a
</p>
<p>careful examination of such evidence, they, the Grand Jury, or a ma-
</p>
<p>jority of them, amounting at least to twelve, are satisfied that a suffi-
</p>
<p>cient case has been made before them, to justify their putting the
</p>
<p>party on his trial, they must find the bill a true bill, and thereupon
</p>
<p>the party becomes formally accused. If, on the contrary, the Grand
</p>
<p>Jury, upon such an examination, are satisfied of the insufficiency of
</p>
<p>the evidence in support of the charge, they must then reject it, and
</p>
<p>thereupon the party is discharged from that bill for that time ; but
</p>
<p>in that case he is not acquitted of the charge contained in it. The
</p>
<p>sufficiency of the evidence depends upon this consideration, whether
</p>
<p>if the party was actually on his trial on a plea of not guilty, and no
</p>
<p>evidence was given for the defence, so that the whole case rested on
</p>
<p>the evidence on the part of the prosecution, he could justly be found
</p>
<p>guilty. Gentlemen, it is further to be observed, that you may find
</p>
<p>the bill a true bill as to some one of the counts contained in it, and
</p>
<p>may reject it as to some one or other of those counts. If you find a
</p>
<p>true bill as to any of the counts, in that case the party accused is put
</p>
<p>on his trial on those counts only so found to be true ; but a Grand Jury
</p>
<p>cannot properly find a bill a true bill as to part of any particular count,
</p>
<p>and not a true bill as to the other part of the same count; and fur-
</p>
<p>ther, that where a bill is preferred against several persons, it may
</p>
<p>generally be found against some of those persons, and rejected as to
</p>
<p>the rest  subject, however, to this plain exception, that where a bill
</p>
<p>is preferred, charging two only with conspiracy, the bill cannot be
</p>
<p>found against one of them. Gentlemen, I have now to tell you that,
</p>
<p>as I understand, the bill likely and intended to be submitted to you
</p>
<p>is a bill against a certain number of persons specified in it, the whole
</p>
<p>being a charge of conspiracy, the sense of which is, agreeing among
</p>
<p>themselves only, or together with others, and concurring with each
</p>
<p>other in a design to effect certain unlawful purposes, or at least to
</p>
<p>effect certain purposes, whether in themselves unlawful or not, by
</p>
<p>unlawful means. Gentlemen, I believe I may state that the great,
</p>
<p>ostensible, and, as I should collect from the statement in the in-

<p>formations sworn before me, the avowed object of the persons
</p>
<p>charged by the bill is the abolition of the Legislative Union between
</p>
<p>Great Britain and Ireland, as at present subsisting. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>it appears to me to be right, with reference to the term Legisla-
</p>
<p>tive Union, and the terms by which I have described it as at pre-
</p>
<p>sent subisting, to advert to some expressions stated in some part
</p>
<p>of the informations on which the indictment is or will be preferred,
</p>
<p>and which it is material to state. It appears, then, that some or one
</p>
<p>of the persons charged has or have asserted, at some or one of the
</p>
<p>public meetings referred to in the informations, that the Legislative
</p>
<p>Union is in itself unlawful; that it is absolutely void : the conse-

</p>
<p>quence of which must be, that every Statute made since the Union,
</p>
<p>and purporting to bind Ireland, will, in that instance, be void, and
</p>
<p>have no legal effect. Gentlemen, whether this language be correctly
</p>
<p>stated, or whether any language to that effect was actually used, or
</p>
<p>if used, was used in that sense, you are to judge, and to satisfy your-
</p>
<p>selves, by the examination of witnesses on oath ; but I think the
</p>
<p>statement in the sworn informations, as I have collected it, authorizes
</p>
<p>and indeed makes it incumbent on me to say, in this place, that
</p>
<p>such a proposition has no legal foundation, and that the Legislative
</p>
<p>Union is not only practically but lawfully in force in Ireland ; and
</p>
<p>that you, in the exercise of your judgment on this indictment which
</p>
<p>will he preferred to you, are bound so to consider it. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>this certainly is not to be supposed to amount to a denial of the
</p>
<p>right of the subjects of this country, or any part of it, at any time to
</p>
<p>contest the policy or expediency of continuing this Legislative Union
</p>
<p>ill its present state, or of seeking, by lawful means, an alteration of
</p>
<p>it ; and accordingly, the charge in the indictment applicable to this
</p>
<p>question is or will be this, or to this effect  have the persons
</p>
<p>charged unlawfully and seditiously conspired to excite disaffection
</p>
<p>and discontent among the Queen's subjects, and to excite them to
</p>
<p>hatred and contempt of the government and constitution as by law
</p>
<p>established, and to unlawful opposition and resistance thereto? and
</p>
<p>in your consideration of the indictment, you will direct your atten-
</p>
<p>tion to this, not only with reference to this particular count, but also
</p>
<p>as it may throw light on your examination of all or any of the counts
</p>
<p>in the indictment. Gentlemen, I will now proceed, in connexion
</p>
<p>with, and with reference to the observations which I have just made,
</p>
<p>to call your attention to one of the charges in the indictment ; it ap-
</p>
<p>pears to me to be of paramount importance ; that is, the one which
</p>
<p>charges, as part of the alleged conspiracy, the inducing and procuring
</p>
<p>large numbers of persons to meet together, in order, by intimidation
</p>
<p>and the demonstration of physical force, to procure changes to be
</p>
<p>made in the constitution of the realm as by law established. Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, with respect to this charge, it is to be observed, so far as I
</p>
<p>can collect from the information before me, that the intimidation
</p>
<p>spoken of does not, or, at least, does not necessarily impute to the
</p>
<p>persons calling together these multitudes, who appear to have been
</p>
<p>assembled at different times, and to have occasionally been addressed,
</p>
<p>as appears by the informations, by the appellation of fighting men, it
</p>
<p>does not, I mean to say, express any design or intention of permitting
</p>
<p>or encouraging any infraction of the public peace on those occasions.
</p>
<p>On the contrary, it would appear to me, that the principal object,
</p>
<p>and one earnestly impressed on these multitudes, was a strict abstain-
</p>
<p>ing from any attempt, at that time, to commit any breach of the
</p>
<p>peace. The charge, as I understand it, is this, namely, an intention
</p>
<p>to intimidate, by the demonstration of great physical force, all per-
</p>
<p>sons who might be adverse to an alteration in the constitution and
</p>
<p>government of the country, and also, and especially, to affect, or en-
</p>
<p>deavour to affect, the proceedings of the legislature on the subject,
</p>
<p>and, at the same time, on pretence of petitioning for a repeal of the

</p>
<p>Union, asserting, in the presence of these assembled multitudes, that
</p>
<p>by their intervention it might and should take place. This seems to
</p>
<p>me to afford ground for charging in the indictment a purpose of inti-
</p>
<p>midating. Gentlemen, whether the parties charged really had that
</p>
<p>purpose or intention it is for you to judge; that is, you will judge
</p>
<p>whether there is or is not matter of charge fit and proper to be
</p>
<p>tried by a jury, on a plea of not guilty. I have further to tell
</p>
<p>you, that the charge in the indictment on this ground is, if true,
</p>
<p>a misdemeanor ; and further, that there appears evidence of the
</p>
<p>truth of that charge, but of the truth of that evidence, and the infe-
</p>
<p>rence to be drawn from it if true, you are, in the first instance, to
</p>
<p>judge, and on that ground either to find or reject the bill. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men of the jury, I have already intimated to you that the evidence
</p>
<p>in support of this charge is of a circumstantial or inferential charac-
</p>
<p>ter, and must therefore be taken into consideration in connexion
</p>
<p>with the other charges in the indictment whicto may be found to
</p>
<p>have a relation to it. Gentlemen, I have alluded to one which charges,
</p>
<p>as part or a circumstance of the object of conspiring, that they have
</p>
<p>excited discontent and disaffection among the Queen's subjects, and
</p>
<p>have endeavoured to seduce from their allegiance divers of the Queen's
</p>
<p>subjects, and among others her subjects serving in the army and
</p>
<p>navy. If the evidence to this effect appears to you to have any
</p>
<p>weight, it not only tends to establish what is in itself at least a high
</p>
<p>misdemeanor, but also to corroborate the evidence on the charges
</p>
<p>which I have before noticed, and therefore in both these views it craves
</p>
<p>your serious attention. Gentlemen, the principal evidence in support
</p>
<p>of this charge, so far, at least, as it has fallen under my observation,
</p>
<p>is to be found in what purports to be a letter or letters published
</p>
<p>in a newspaper, 01 perhaps in several newspapers, of which some or
</p>
<p>one of the parties accused, are or is the editors or editor. These
</p>
<p>documents, or whatever documents there may be of this descrip-
</p>
<p>tion, should be considered by you with care, with a view first
</p>
<p>to elicit the true meaning and intention of the composition itself.
</p>
<p>You are aware that it is to be supposed that a design of such a
</p>
<p>description would be conveyed in ambiguous and very careful and
</p>
<p>studied language. Secondly, you will have to consider with atten-
</p>
<p>tion, the fact of its being published with or without the knowledge
</p>
<p>of the parties charged, and whether its so appearing in public was or
</p>
<p>was not in accordance with the intention of the parties concerned, or
</p>
<p>any of them. Gentlemen, this is a charge which I do consider of a
</p>
<p>very important nature indeed, and to which, therefore, 1 call your
</p>
<p>particular attention, for the purpose of judging whether any design
</p>
<p>of the kind was really entertained. If there be sufficient evidence
</p>
<p>to induce you to believe that it is as it at. present appears  that there
</p>
<p>was a design of this description, you will have to consider whether it
</p>
<p>ought or ought not to be submitted to a jury empanelled between
</p>
<p>the Crown and the subject, in order to arrive at the truth of the
</p>
<p>charge. Gentlemen, there is another charge, which, with the same
</p>
<p>view, that is, its relation to the charge of designed intimidation by the
</p>
<p>demonstration of physical force, deserves, as it appears to me, your
</p>
<p>particular attention. That is the charge of soliciting and obtaining,

</p>
<p>as well from different parts of the United Kingdom, as from foreign
</p>
<p>countries, large sums of money, in order to promote and effect the
</p>
<p>objects charged by the indictment. There is certainly evidence, and
</p>
<p>I think I may venture to say clear evidence of the receipt of con-
</p>
<p>tributions from different parts of the United Kingdom, and also from
</p>
<p>foreign countries, and also of terms of acknowledgment of such re-
</p>
<p>ceipt, and of encouraging, if not directly soliciting, the continuance
</p>
<p>of them. The question upon this part of the case will, I apprehend,
</p>
<p>be whether these contributions were received for the purpose charged
</p>
<p>by the indictment, or at least whether they do not so raise this
</p>
<p>question or presumption upon such evidence, either direct or infe-
</p>
<p>rential, as to make out a case requiring a defence from the parties
</p>
<p>charged in the indictment. Gentlemen, this will be a matter for
</p>
<p>your consideration  I feel however, that I may, according to my view
</p>
<p>of the subject, add this, that the offence, as it appears to be charged,
</p>
<p>(I allude here to the motive and purpose ascribed to the collection
</p>
<p>of these contributions) is a misdemeanor, and I cannot but feel that
</p>
<p>I am bound to say that in my own present view of this part of the case,
</p>
<p>the fact itself opens consideration of very great importance, and
</p>
<p>such as will, in my judgment, on the admitted or hitherto uncontro-
</p>
<p>verted circumstances, disclose a case very fit for, and which possibly
</p>
<p>could only be satisfactorily adjudicated on by a trial on a plea of
</p>
<p>not guilty to the indictment. Gentlemen, there is another charge of
</p>
<p>a specific offence which I think it right to call to your notice. It is
</p>
<p>in itself a charge which craves your attention and consideration, and
</p>
<p>it is not without application to the other charges in the indictment, so
</p>
<p>far at least as respects the remote and possible consequences of
</p>
<p>these proceedings, which are the immediate subject of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment. I here allude to the charge of endeavouring to bring
</p>
<p>into contempt and disrepute the legal tribunals of the country ; to
</p>
<p>diminish the confidence of the Queen's subjects in the same, and to
</p>
<p>assume and usurp the prerogative of the Crown in the establishment
</p>
<p>of Courts for the administration of the law. Upon this, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>I will only say that the offence, as here charged, is a misdemeanor,
</p>
<p>and that there is evidence partly, but not altogether, of an inferential
</p>
<p>character in support of this charge, inasmuch as the evidence in
</p>
<p>some particulars goes to the actual appointment of persons to fill the
</p>
<p>office of administering justice in public Courts designed for that pur-
</p>
<p>pose, and accompanied by declarations, if the evidence be true, that
</p>
<p>the Judges should for the future be appointed by the people. Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, such a measure,  I mean the appointment of public arbitra-
</p>
<p>tors to decide upon matters in litigation and dispute between the
</p>
<p>Queen's subjects,  if it should be considered beneficial to the public,
</p>
<p>ought properly to have been effected by an Act of Parliament. This
</p>
<p>measure may seem to have been adopted in this particular case, on
</p>
<p>the assumption that the Parliament of the United Kingdom is not
</p>
<p>a lawful Parliament, and therefore, that the Queen's subjects in
</p>
<p>Ireland are justified in acting in opposition to, or in contempt
</p>
<p>of its authority. The fact of such an assumption, is however,
</p>
<p>in this particular wholly inferential. I cannot however but observe,

</p>
<p>that in cases of such a description, in which the character of the act
</p>
<p>or acts on which the indictment is grounded depends on the question
</p>
<p>of a supposed guilty design, and consequently, an inference of
</p>
<p>law applicable to an hypothetical case, it must be a matter of
</p>
<p>much difficulty for a Grand Jury, in the exercise of their functions, to
</p>
<p>come to a determination upon it ; and therefore, if the facts upon
</p>
<p>which the offence is charged, and upon which the inference is to be
</p>
<p>deduced, be clearly proved, it may be the better course to find the
</p>
<p>bill, leaving the evidence and the legal consequence of it to be deter-
</p>
<p>mined at the trial, on an issue joined on the plea of not guilty.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I hope I have so far made myself intelligible to you, as to
</p>
<p>the course of your duty, and as to the consequences of the exercise of
</p>
<p>that duty. If in the exercise of that you find the bill a true bill, you
</p>
<p>will send the case to be tried by a jury empannelled between the
</p>
<p>Crown and the subject. There is a circumstance which I feel
</p>
<p>7
</p>
<p>some little difficulty in speaking to you of; at the same time that
</p>
<p>I think it not improper to make some observation upon it. I am
</p>
<p>not sure that it will be necessary for you to take it into considera-
</p>
<p>tion. Gentlemen, it is, I believe, well known, that one of the
</p>
<p>witnesses from whom the informations were taken, and upon whose
</p>
<p>testimony the indictment may, at least in part, be grounded, has him-
</p>
<p>self been publicly charged with misrepresentation on a matter of
</p>
<p>identification, that is, in identifying a particular person. You will
</p>
<p>probably, if he should be produced to you, cross-examine him on
</p>
<p>this subject ; and I have only to tell you, that if a misrepresentation
</p>
<p>appears to have been made by him, on his oath, and to have been so
</p>
<p>made wilfully, and with a consciousness of the falsehood of
</p>
<p>the matters sworn to by him, it follows, that such a misrepre-
</p>
<p>sentation will justly disentitle him to any credit from you ; and
</p>
<p>further, if it should appear to have been a misrepresentation arising
</p>
<p>from negligence, that is, from want of proper care and attention to
</p>
<p>the important duty he had to discharge, it may, under all the circum-
</p>
<p>stances, be sufficient materially to affect his credit, though not suffi-
</p>
<p>cient to disentitle him to all credit as to the truth of other parts of
</p>
<p>his testimony. Gentlemen, the case, at least so far as it is in my
</p>
<p>power to bring it under your consideration, with a view to the effec-
</p>
<p>tual discharge of your duty, is now substantially before you, and so
</p>
<p>far as the informations sworn before me go. It is right to observe,
</p>
<p>that upon notification to the parties charged by the intended prose-
</p>
<p>cution, they immediately and voluntarily, and very creditably to
</p>
<p>themselves, entered into recognizances to appear and abide the pro-
</p>
<p>secution. You will now proceed to the examination of the evidence,
</p>
<p>and you will allow me very respectfully to request you to bring to it
</p>
<p>minds free from preoccupation, prejudice, or prepossession, so far as
</p>
<p>concerns the alleged guilt of the parties brought before you. The
</p>
<p>subject you have to consider is very important. That is indeed
</p>
<p>a very feeble epithet to apply to it. From the motives that have led
</p>
<p>to the movement, from the means used in conducting it, and from
</p>
<p>its possible results, it is, in my judgment, of a most awful nature. But

</p>
<p>that does not authorize us to consider the question otherwise than as
</p>
<p>leading to a strictly impartial judgment upon its legal character.
</p>
<p>You will remember what I have all along intimated to you, that to
</p>
<p>this moment the parties are not, legally speaking, accused of any
</p>
<p>offence. You are to judge not whether they are guilty, but whether
</p>
<p>they shall be accused ; that is, whether they shall be called upon to
</p>
<p>admit or confess or disclaim the imputation ; and upon their dis-
</p>
<p>claimer, that is, on their plea of not guilty, they will have to meet
</p>
<p>the legal accusation by evidence, either denying the charge or ex-
</p>
<p>plaining it away. Upon these topics the jury will have to decide.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I am aware that I have made but an imperfect state-
</p>
<p>ment to you. I have only to add, that if any other question should
</p>
<p>arise, or any further exposition of the law should become necessary
</p>
<p>on this indictment, the Court will be ready to afford you every
</p>
<p>assistance in its power.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General.  The indictment which your Lordship
</p>
<p>has adverted to is ready to be laid before the Grand Jury, and will be
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>sent up to them at half-past ten to-morrow, or at any hour that
</p>
<p>may be convenient to them, and the witnesses will then be in
</p>
<p>attendance.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell, Q. C.  The parties, who are bound by their recog-
</p>
<p>nizances to attend, are present, in case any order should be made by
</p>
<p>the Court.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General.  They are bound to attend not only to-
</p>
<p>day, but from day to day, until called on.
</p>
<p>SATURDAY, November 4th.
</p>
<p>The Foreman of the Grand Jury stated to the Court, that a cleri-
</p>
<p>cal error had been made in the fourth count of the indictment, the
</p>
<p>name of the Rev. Peter James Tyrrel being substituted throughout
</p>
<p>that count for that of the Rev. Thomas Tierney.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice having inquired whether any of the counsel
</p>
<p>for the traversers were present.
</p>
<p>Mr. Macdonagh, Q. C, appeared as counsel for the Rev.
</p>
<p>Thomas Tierney r , when
</p>
<p>The Attorney General objected to his addressing the Court on
</p>
<p>the ground that he had not obtained a license from the Crown to
</p>
<p>defend the traverser.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cantwell, the agent for the Rev. Thomas Tierney, stated,
</p>
<p>that he had obtained the license, and called on Mr. Macdonagh to
</p>
<p>proceed.
</p>
<p>Mr. Macdonagh then objected to the bill being amended, there
</p>
<p>being nothing to amend by.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General.  The counsel for a party has no right
</p>
<p>to address the Court before the indictment is found. Until then,
</p>
<p>all the proceedings are ex parte. I therefore object to counsel ad-
</p>
<p>dressing the Court at the present stage of the proceedings. With
</p>
<p>respect to the amendment, the error is merely a clerical one ; the
</p>
<p>substitution of one name for the other ; and I apprehend the Court
</p>
<p>has power to have the bill amended. This is not an application to
</p>
<p>amend the indictment after it has been found.
</p>
<p>Mr. Macdonagh  The Attorney General will remember that I

</p>
<p>did not address the Court until I was called on to do so.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  The irregularity is attributable to
</p>
<p>me in calling on Mr. Macdonagh. The Court is of opinion that
</p>
<p>this is not to be considered as an indictment. It is merely a bill
</p>
<p>sent up to the Grand Jury on the part of the Crown, by the
</p>
<p>Attorney General, through the hands of the Clerk of the Crown,
</p>
<p>and therefore that no person ought at present to be heard. If the
</p>
<p>Attorney Generafis desirous of having a clerical mistake amended,
</p>
<p>the Court will permit him to do so. Indeed, I say he may do so
</p>
<p>without applying to the Court at all. For the present, the bill is to
</p>
<p>be handed back to the Grand Jury.
</p>
<p>The Attorney- General.  Since the Grand Jury were sworn, I
</p>
<p>find that one of them is a Quaker, and has accordingly made an affir-
</p>
<p>mation. The indictment therefore, in pursuance to a recent case
</p>
<p>in England, reported in 2 Car. & Payne, 78, before Baron Alder-
</p>
<p>son, at the Worcester Assizes, should commence thus :  " the jurors
</p>
<p>" for our Lady the Queen, upon their oaths and affirmation, do pre-
</p>
<p>" sent, &c," instead of the usual form, "on their oaths do present."
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin referred to the Statute of 6 & 7 Vic.
</p>
<p>cap. 85, sec. 2, which he thought might render the alteration unne-
</p>
<p>cessary.
</p>
<p>The Attorney- General and Mr. Brewster, Q. C, stated, that
</p>
<p>having looked into the Act, they thought that doubts might arise,
</p>
<p>whether it applied to Grand Jurors, or whether it was merely en-
</p>
<p>acted to prevent variances in the setting out of legal proceedings, in
</p>
<p>other legal proceedings; whereupon,
</p>
<p>The Court refused to make any order on the subject, but left it
</p>
<p>to the Attorney-General to adopt what course he pleased. The bill
</p>
<p>of indictment was then handed down, and the required alteration
</p>
<p>made by the Attorney-General.

<p>October, and November, 1843. "And you are to take notice, that
</p>
<p>" each and every of the said several matters hereinbefore mentioned or
</p>
<p>" referred to, will be offered in evidence at the trial of this case, in
</p>
<p>" support of each and every of the counts in the indictment. Dated
</p>
<p> 13th of November, 1843."
</p>
<p>WEDNESDAY, November 8th.
</p>
<p>At three o'clock on this day, the Foreman of the Grand Jury
</p>
<p>addressed the Court, and handed down the indictment to the Clerk
</p>
<p>of the Crown, who read the finding of the Grand Jury, which was
</p>
<p>in the following words  " A true bill for self and fellows,  George
</p>
<p>Frederick Brooke."
</p>
<p>35* ,
</p>
<p>Mr. Richard O'Gorman (one of the Grand Jurors), I beg to ex
</p>
<p>press my dissent from that bill.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General.  I move that the traversers be now
</p>
<p>called on their recognizances.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown then called over the following names : 
</p>
<p>Daniel O'Connell, Esq., John O'Connell, Esq., John Gray, Esq.,
</p>
<p>Thomas Steele, Esq., Richard Barrett, Esq., the Rev. Thomas
</p>
<p>Tierney, the Rev. Peter James Tyrrell, Charles Gavan Duffy, Esq.,
</p>
<p>Thomas Matthew Ray, Esq.
</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas Steele I take this opportunity of stating, that I
</p>
<p>intend to defend myself without the aid of counsel, as I did suc-
</p>
<p>cessfully on a former occasion ; but I strongly object to be prose-
</p>
<p>cuted by the Attorney-General, who has publicly manifested a pre-
</p>
<p>judice in the case. I do not speak of the other traversers  they
</p>
<p>will take their own course ; but I hope that a sense of propriety, or
</p>
<p>I should rather say, common decency, will induce him to retire, and
</p>
<p>leave the trial to be prosecuted by his highly gifted, patient, and
</p>
<p>temperate colleague, the Solicitor-General.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General I now move for an order from your
</p>
<p>Lordships, that the traversers do plead four days from the present
</p>
<p>time, pursuant to the Statute 60 Geo. III. cap. 4, sec. 1, which enacts,
</p>
<p>that the person, prosecuted by indictment or information, for a mis-
</p>
<p>demeanor in this Court, and who shall appear in term time, in per-
</p>
<p>son, to answer such indictment or information, shall, upon being
</p>
<p>charged therewith, not be permitted to imparl to a following term,
</p>
<p>but shall be required to plead or demur thereto within four days
</p>
<p>from the time of the appearance. I seek a similar order to that made
</p>
<p>in the case of The King v. O'Connell, on the 26th of January, 1831.
</p>
<p>In that case the rule was special, in consequence of the defendant
</p>
<p>having been called, and not being in attendance, and undertaking by
</p>
<p>his attorney to appear in person on the following day, the rule was
</p>
<p>entered so as to run from the preceding day. I apprehend, that it
</p>
<p>is the duty of the officer to charge the traversers, who are now pre-
</p>
<p>sent, with the indictment.

</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell I am not aware this course should be adopted,
</p>
<p>but, on the part of Daniel O'Connell, I move, my Lords, that he
</p>
<p>should be forthwith furnished with a copy of the indictment.
</p>
<p>The several counsel for the other traversers, and Mr. Steele on
</p>
<p>his own behalf, made similar applications.
</p>
<p>The Attorney- General The copies of the indictment shall be
</p>
<p>furnished as soon as possible. The section of the Act is precise, that
</p>
<p>the defendant, when charged with the indictment, must plead thereto
</p>
<p>within four days from the time of his appearance.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore, Q. C.  The words of the 8th section, by which the
</p>
<p>traverser is entitled to a copy of the indictment, are equally precise.
</p>
<p>The two sections must be read together in order to give the party
</p>
<p>accused the advantage he is entitled to. If the construction put upon
</p>
<p>the Statute by the Attorney-General be right, the party would be
</p>
<p>called on to plead to an indictment which he had not seen.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  The Act is peremptory, the Court
</p>
<p>36*
</p>
<p>has no discretion. The Act requires that the party should plead or
</p>
<p>demur within four days. I do not say that, if a satisfactory case
</p>
<p>were made, and an application made to the Court to extend the time
</p>
<p>for pleading, that the Court would not grant it. But we are not to
</p>
<p>assume that there will be any necessity to ask for further time than
</p>
<p>that specified by the Act.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin.  The only question is, whether the party
</p>
<p>is charged with the indictment, before he receives a copy, or hears
</p>
<p>it read.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon, Q. C.  It is not necessary that the indictment
</p>
<p>should be read. At common law, a party was entitled to have the in-
</p>
<p>dictment read to him, and until then he was not bound to plead to it.
</p>
<p>The Statute merely did away with imparlances, but it did not de-
</p>
<p>prive the party of his right to have the indictment read, but substitu-
</p>
<p>ted instead of that, that he should be furnished with a copy, if he
</p>
<p>chose to apply for it. I submit, until he has been furnished with this
</p>
<p>copy, or until it has been read to him, the rule to plead cannot be
</p>
<p>entered.
</p>
<p>Mr. Macdonagh.  There are two questions here :  first, what is
</p>
<p>the meaning of the words " being charged," and secondly, what is the
</p>
<p>true construction of the Statute, reading the 1st and 8th sections to-
</p>
<p>gether ? First, he is not charged with the indictment until called on
</p>
<p>to hear it read, in order to make his defence  that is the true con-
</p>
<p>struction and plain meaning of the first section. The Act was passed
</p>
<p>to prevent imparlances, but does not deprive the party of his com-
</p>
<p>mon law right to have the indictment read to him. By the 8th sec-
</p>
<p>tion, he is entitled to a copy to enable him to prepare his defence ;
</p>
<p>and if he be furnished with a copy, that is tantamount to the reading
</p>
<p>of it, but he cannot stand charged, until either it has been read to
</p>
<p>him or he has been furnished with a copy.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General.  If the parties insist on it, I do not op-
</p>
<p>pose the reading of it, but as a matter of convenience, copies will be
</p>
<p>furnished within an hour. The 1st and 8th sections of the Statute are
</p>
<p>not to be read together. A party is not entitled to a copy of the in-
</p>

</p>
<p>dictment until the bill has been found ; there is no provision that he
</p>
<p>should be furnished with a copy of the bill, we could not provide co-
</p>
<p>pies until the bill has been found ; but it is clear that he stands charg-
</p>
<p>ed with the indictment the moment it has been found ; and we are
</p>
<p>entitled to have the rule to plead entered, before copies have been
</p>
<p>furnished. All I require is, that the parties should stand charged
</p>
<p>with the indictment.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  I would ask Mr. Moore if he is sa-
</p>
<p>tisfied to have the substance of the indictment read.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore  My Lord, in a criminal case I would not feel myself
</p>
<p>warranted in giving any consent.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton I apprehend, that under the Statute,
</p>
<p>they cannot be called upon to plead until charged with the indict-
</p>
<p>ment. If the traversers are satisfied with a short statement of it by
</p>
<p>the Clerk of the Crown, they then will stand charged, if not, it
</p>
<p>must be read. The eighth section has no connexion with the first.
</p>
<p>37*
</p>
<p>The party has two rights, one to have the indictment read, and to be
</p>
<p>charged with it, and the other to have a copy furnished without ex-
</p>
<p>pense. I would suggest that the rule to plead be entered now, and
</p>
<p>the time to run from to-morrow. This order the Court can make
</p>
<p>without the consent of the parties.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown then commenced to read the first count
</p>
<p>of the indictment ; when having read a few lines, he was stopped by
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell. The rule to plead was then entered, the four days
</p>
<p>to run from the following day.
</p>
<p>THURSDAY, November 9th.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henri, Q. C My Lords, on the part of Mr. John O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell, I have to apply for liberty to compare the copy of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment which has been furnished with the original. It is essential,
</p>
<p>before we are called on to plead, that we should be certain the copies
</p>
<p>furnished to us are correct copies. Suppose that in this indictment
</p>
<p>there was a material variance, and that we demurred for that ; and if
</p>
<p>it were found, upon comparing the copy with the original, that this
</p>
<p>variance did not exist, the demurrer would be overruled.
</p>
<p>The Attorney- General.  I apprehend that the copies have been
</p>
<p>certified by the Crown Solicitor ; if so, they are not entitled to have
</p>
<p>them compared.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice I apprehend that the common
</p>
<p>course is, to give not only certified, but attested copies. I think,
</p>
<p>therefore, that this application ought to be granted.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn.  I now apply to your Lordships for further time to
</p>
<p>plead.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  I think this is the subject matter of
</p>
<p>a distinct motion, and notice must be given to the Attorney Ge-
</p>
<p>neral.
</p>
<p>Mr. Macdonagh.  My Lords, on behalf of Mr. Barrett, I move
</p>
<p>that he be furnished with a copy of the caption of the indictment.
</p>
<p>The Attorney -General.  This is a motion without notice.
</p>
<p>Mr. Macdonagh I submit a motion is not necessary. An or-
</p>
<p>der was made by the Court that we should be furnished with the

<p>copy of the indictment, and the Crown have not complied with that
</p>
<p>order, as they have not furnished us with a perfect copy. They
</p>
<p>have omitted the caption, which is part of the indictment.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice We have nothing before us to
</p>
<p>shew that the order has not been complied with.
</p>
<p>Mr. Macdonagh.  My Lord, you have the copy of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment which shows that. We cannot now serve a notice, as we will
</p>
<p>require this before we are called on to plead ; and if we are called
</p>
<p>on to serve a notice we would be bound to plead before the motion
</p>
<p>be moveable.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn.  In this case we are not bound to give any notice.
</p>
<p>Under the terms of the Act we were entitled to this order ; and we
</p>
<p>38*
</p>
<p>say that the officer has not complied with the order of the Court, as
</p>
<p>he has furnished an imperfect copy, and no notice is therefore neces-
</p>
<p>sary.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  According to the common rule of
</p>
<p>the Court, where a party has a motion to make he must give notice
</p>
<p>of it, more especially when counsel on the other side says he will
</p>
<p>oppose that motion. I see no reason why the Court should go out
</p>
<p>of its ordinary course in this case; notice of this application must
</p>
<p>therefore be given.
</p>
<p>SATURDAY, November 11th.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside, Q,. C, on the part of Charles Gavan Duffy, moved
</p>
<p>that the Clerk of the Crown be directed to amend the copy of the
</p>
<p>indictment already furnished, by adding the entries and endorsement
</p>
<p>on the indictment, including the names of the witnesses, and relied
</p>
<p>on the following authorities in support of his application : 1 Deacon,
</p>
<p>Cr. Law, 667 ; Foster's Cr. Law, 228 ; Cooke's Case, 13 State Trials,
</p>
<p>330 ; the 60 Geo. III. c. 4 ; Rex v. Simmons, 1 Carr. & Payne, 84 ;
</p>
<p>Rex v. Beazley, 4 Carr. & Payne, 220 ; Regina v. Bull, 9 Carr. &
</p>
<p>Payne, 22; 6 & 7 Will. IV. c. 114.
</p>
<p>The Attorney. General, for the Crown, opposed the motion, and
</p>
<p>relied on Regina v. Gordon, 6 Jurist, 996 ; and contended that the
</p>
<p>witnesses' names were not part of the indictment, inasmuch as they
</p>
<p>never appeared on the record when it was made up, and that the tra-
</p>
<p>verser was therefore not entitled to a copy of the witnesses' names,
</p>
<p>under the Statute 60 Geo. III. c. 4.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Hagan followed for the traverser, and contended that the
</p>
<p>only case cited by the Attorney-General was an authority against
</p>
<p>him. He also cited the following authorities : Coke's preface to 3
</p>
<p>Reports ; Dickenson's Quarter Sessions, 204 ; 2 Gabbett's Cr. Law,
</p>
<p>196 ; Rex v. Brown, 1 Salk. 376 ; Roy v. Ford, Yelverton, 99 ;
</p>
<p>Delap v. Leonard, 5 Ir. Law Rep. 108 ; 6 & 7 Will. IV. c. 114 ; 1
</p>
<p>& 2 Vic. c.37 ; Anonymous, 1 Lewin's C C. 322 ; Rex v. Dickenson,
</p>
<p>Russ. & Ryan, 401 ; 2 Hale's P. C. ; Deacon v. Duke, Forster's Cr.
</p>
<p>Law, 229,*230; East's Pleas of the Crown, 113.

</p>
<p>The Solicitor- General replied, citing Rex v. Sheridan, 31 State
</p>
<p>Trials, 574 ; Lady FulwooaVs case, Cro. Car. 483.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice  The Court are of opinion that the
</p>
<p>application in this case cannot be granted. It is not grounded on
</p>
<p>any particular state of facts, making a special case, which might in-
</p>
<p>duce the Court to believe that what the traverser asks for, is neces-
</p>
<p>sary to enable him to defend himself against the present charge. He
</p>
<p>makes no particular case ; he states no particular facts, but he de-
</p>
<p>mands, as a matter of right, that the names of the witnesses that are
</p>
<p>endorsed on the indictment which has been found against him, and
</p>
<p>returned as a true bill by the Grand Jury, shall be furnished to him.
</p>
<p>It is an extraordinary thing, if this be an application of right ex de-
</p>
<p>39*
</p>
<p>bito justitice, that his able and learned counsel have not been able to
</p>
<p>refer, not only to a decision, but a single instance in which such a prac-
</p>
<p>tice has been adopted or pressed. Nay, more, they have not been
</p>
<p>able to shew to the Court a single instance of such an application
</p>
<p>having been made. It is altogether, and in all its parts, a motion
</p>
<p>without precedent ; and being a motion without precedent, and the
</p>
<p>practice being reported by the officer of the Court to be the other
</p>
<p>way, without going further into the question, the Court is of opinion
</p>
<p>that that is a sufficient ground to refuse the motion, unless the party
</p>
<p>applying can demonstrate that he is entitled as a matter of right, con-
</p>
<p>trary to all practice, to demand that which he now comes forward to de-
</p>
<p>mand. On what ground is he entitled to this, as a matter of right?
</p>
<p>Before the Act in question, the 60 Geo. III. c. 4, what was that right
</p>
<p>founded on? The case of Rex v. Sheridan proves, that as a mat-
</p>
<p>ter of right the Crown is not bound to furnish the accused with
</p>
<p>the evidence against him, nor with a list of the witnesses ; and
</p>
<p>that authority and decision of the Court of King's Bench, delivered
</p>
<p>by Lord Chief Justice Downes, which was cited for the ac-
</p>
<p>cused, is a direct authority against him, on the matter of right. Well,
</p>
<p>then, is there any thing in the Act of Parliament which has changed
</p>
<p>the law on the subject. I do not find that there is any language
</p>
<p>in the Act of Parliament which has changed the law, and I would
</p>
<p>observe, that the law does not depend merely on what was
</p>
<p>the practice in Ireland in Crown proceedings, but the same has
</p>
<p>at all times been the law in England, and there is no instance of an
</p>
<p>application to an English Court where the Act of 60 Geo. III. does
</p>
<p>apply. There is no instance at common law of such an application
</p>
<p>having been made ex debito justitice to a Court in England, so that we
</p>
<p>have the established practice of both countries to show that the pre-
</p>
<p>sent application is as unfounded in point of fact as it is unauthorized by
</p>
<p>any decision or authority. Then the case is to be considered whether
</p>
<p>the Act of 60 Geo. III. has so changed the law as to entitle a party
</p>
<p>now to demand that ex debito justitice which before the passing of the
</p>
<p>Act it appears he had no right to; what is then the import of this

</p>
<p>Act of Parliament, by which a traverser is privileged or warranted to
</p>
<p>demand by his counsel the names of the witnesses ? I have already
</p>
<p>observed that the case of Rex v. Sheridan, produced and cited by
</p>
<p>the traverser's counsel, furnishes a strong reason why such an appli-
</p>
<p>cation should not be granted, as being dangerous to the administra-
</p>
<p>tion of justice, and as preventing in the end a fair trial. A party
</p>
<p>having got into possession of the names of the witnesses may keep
</p>
<p>the witnesses back. There is not in the part of the Act which is
</p>
<p>directory, any mention made of the names of the witnesses at all ; the
</p>
<p>Act directs that parties standing in the situation of those who are
</p>
<p>now making this application should have copies of the indictment free
</p>
<p>of expense. It had been the custom in this country, that parties
</p>
<p>charged with misdemeanors should be furnished with copies of the
</p>
<p>indictment from the office of the Clerk of the Crown, paying a fair
</p>
<p>and reasonable amount for them. The present Act gives them copies
</p>
<p>as a matter of right free of expense, but what is there in it gives them a
</p>
<p>40*
</p>
<p>right to a copy of the names of the witnesses. The Act gives them
</p>
<p>a copy of the indictment with which they are to be put in charge,
</p>
<p>for the purpose of enabling them to take measures and proceedings to
</p>
<p>defend themselves against the charge. To enable them to plead to
</p>
<p>the charge which appears on the face of the indictment, that which
</p>
<p>does not appear need not be furnished. Why are they to be fur-
</p>
<p>nished with the names of the witnesses? Their defence, if any they
</p>
<p>have, does not depend on the names of the witnesses, but on the
</p>
<p>nature of the charge. Whether the names of the witnesses be A and
</p>
<p>B or C and D, they are not a whit benefited by knowing them,
</p>
<p>either with reference to the nature of their defence, or the
</p>
<p>mode of conducting it. The charge is one and the same, and the
</p>
<p>defence remains one and the same. The Act of Parliament did
</p>
<p>not contemplate that this would be for the relief of the traversers,
</p>
<p>and therefore no notice whatever is taken of the names of the per-
</p>
<p>sons endorsed on the indictment. Then it is said that the names
</p>
<p>must be taken to be, and are in contemplation of law, a part of the
</p>
<p>indictment. The Act of Parliament, by directing that the parties
</p>
<p>accused should have a copy of the indictment, did not intend to
</p>
<p>include in that a copy of the names of the witnesses, who preferred
</p>
<p>the charge against him. Those are two very different things, and
</p>
<p>the case of Rex v. Sheridan, shews how eminently different they
</p>
<p>are. It is very right that the party accused should be acquainted
</p>
<p>with the charge against him, but it may not be at all right that the
</p>
<p>particular evidence by which that charge is to be supported, should
</p>
<p>be handed over and given to the party accused. The contemplation
</p>
<p>of the law has been altogether otherwise. The decisions have been
</p>
<p>altogether otherwise ; and if I am to be told, if the Court is to be
</p>
<p>told, that there is an alteration in the law, by reason of the late Act
</p>
<p>of Parliament, directing a copy of the indictment, some express
</p>
<p>provision of the Statute should have been pointed out to that effect.
</p>
<p>There is nothing of the kind. The Statute did not intend any
</p>
<p>alteration to be made in this respect, and therefore it is quite
</p>
<p>silent with regard to the witnesses. The Court would expect,

</p>
<p>and every reasonable man would expect, that if such an alteration
</p>
<p>of the law had been intended, it would have appeared on the face of
</p>
<p>the Statute itself, so that there would have been no possibility of
</p>
<p>doubt or mistake. There are no express words in the Act, and there
</p>
<p>is no reason to infer that such was the intention of the legislature;
</p>
<p>and it is capable of being demonstrated, that the names endorsed on
</p>
<p>the back of the indictment do not form a part of it, from the fact,
</p>
<p>which is not controverted, that they are never introduced on the re-
</p>
<p>cord. If they were a part of the indictment, they must be included
</p>
<p>in the record. They never are, and therefore there is no reason
</p>
<p>whatever for the Court to infer that the operation and meaning of the
</p>
<p>Act in question was, that the names of the witnesses should be given,
</p>
<p>though the Act itself takes no express notice of them. That being
</p>
<p>the fair view of the case, and it being a conceded fact, that no prece-
</p>
<p>dent can be brought before the Court upon which to ground this ap-
</p>
<p>plication, we must assume that it is unprecedented, contrary to the
</p>
<p>41*
</p>
<p>practice at all times in this country, and therefore in the ahsence of
</p>
<p>all authority, in the ahsence of all decisions of the Court, we are
</p>
<p>bound by the practice which the officer informs us has always subsist-
</p>
<p>ed without any deviation. The judgment of the Court is therefore,
</p>
<p>that the application cannot be granted.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Burton, and Mr. Justice Crampton concurred.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin  I concur in the judgment of the Court
</p>
<p>that the application should be refused. It is in effect an application
</p>
<p>to amend or complete the copy of the indictment furnished, by in-
</p>
<p>serting in it the names of the witnesses endorsed on the back of the
</p>
<p>indictment. I do not consider that the names are any part of the
</p>
<p>indictment. The authorities which have been referred to, among
</p>
<p>others, Foster's Crown Law, unequivocally say : " That the party
</p>
<p>" accused is entitled to a copy of the whole indictment, but is not
</p>
<p>" entitled to a list of the witnesses." It never was contended in any
</p>
<p>case that I ever heard of, or that was cited at the bar, that the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses' names are any part of the indictment. As my Lord Chief
</p>
<p>Justice has observed, there are no particular grounds laid in this
</p>
<p>case for the application. It was not made on the ground that in
</p>
<p>this particular case the names of the witnesses were necessary, or
</p>
<p>would be conducive to the defence of the parties. The application
</p>
<p>is simply this, that the officer shall be directed to amend the copy
</p>
<p>furnished already, as if the names of the witnesses were part of the
</p>
<p>indictment. In my opinion they are not, and a motion made on that
</p>
<p>ground must therefore fail. I cannot think it necessary to make any
</p>
<p>observations on the cases which have been cited. With regard to
</p>
<p>the case of Rex v. Sheridan, I should hesitate before I gave my
</p>
<p>opinion, that the principle laid down there should govern the Court,
</p>
<p>now, because the law has since been altered by the Legislature. I
</p>
<p>therefore express no opinion on it, nor do I say whether a case might
</p>
<p>be made for an application similar to the present one. My opinion
</p>
<p>is formed on the application now before the Court, and on the grounds
</p>
<p>on which it has been rested.
</p>
<p>SAME DAY.

<p>Mr. Macdonagh My Lords, on the part of the Rev. Peter
</p>
<p>James Tyrrell, I apply that a copy of the ca ption of the indictment
</p>
<p>be furnished to him or his attorney ; or that the copy already fur-
</p>
<p>nished be amended by adding the caption thereto. I move on the
</p>
<p>affidavit of the attorney for the traverser, which states that the appli-
</p>
<p>cation is not made for delay. At common law in cases of treason
</p>
<p>and felony the accused party was not entitled to a copy of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment, Sir Henry Vane's case, 1 Lev. 68 ; Rex v. Holland, 4 T. R.
</p>
<p>692. In cases of misdemeanor he was entitled to it as a matter of
</p>
<p>right, 1 Chitty, Cr. Law, 403. In order to entitle the parties accused
</p>
<p>of treason to a copy of the indictment, the 7 Will. III. c. 3, after
</p>
<p>reciting " that nothing is more just and reasonable than that persons
</p>
<p>42*
</p>
<p>" prosecuted for high treason, and misprision of treason, whereby the
</p>
<p>" liberties, lives, honours, estates, blood and posterity of the subject
</p>
<p>" may be lost and destroyed, should be justly and equally tried, and
</p>
<p>" that persons accused as offenders therein should not be debarred
</p>
<p>" of all just and equal means for defence of their innocencies in such
</p>
<p>" cases," enacts, " that all and every person and persons whatsoever
</p>
<p>" that shall be accused and indicted for high treason, whereby any
</p>
<p>" corruption of blood may or shall be made to any such offender or
</p>
<p>" offenders, or to any of the heir or heirs of any such offender or
</p>
<p>" offenders, or for misprision of such treason, shall have a true copy
</p>
<p>" of the whole indictment, but not the names of the witnesses, deliv-
</p>
<p>" ered unto them, or any of them, five days at least before he or they
</p>
<p>" shall be tried for the same, whereby to enable them, or any of them
</p>
<p>" respectively to advise with counsel thereupon, to plead and make
</p>
<p>" their defence." My Lords, the construction put upon that Act was,
</p>
<p>that in order to carry its intention into effect, a copy of the caption
</p>
<p>of the indictment should be furnished. And accordingly it is laid
</p>
<p>down by Sir W. Blackstone, 4 Bl. Com. 351, that " the prisoner shall
</p>
<p>" have a copy of the indictment (which includes the caption); but
</p>
<p>" not the names of the witnesses, five days at least before the trial ;
</p>
<p>" that is, upon the true construction of the Act, before his arraign-
</p>
<p>" ment ; for then is his time to take exceptions thereto by way of
</p>
<p>" plea or demurrer." That practice was followed in 1746, in David
</p>
<p>Morgan's case, Foster, 1, and is adopted by Sir Michael Foster, 227-
</p>
<p>229. The first edition of Sir Michael Foster's work was published
</p>
<p>in 1762, nearly a century after the Act of Will. III. was passed, and
</p>
<p>the practice of giving a copy of the caption had been followed during
</p>
<p>the whole of that period. The same rule is laid down in modem
</p>
<p>works upon criminal law: in 1 East, P. C. 113, and 1 Chitty Cr. L.
</p>
<p>404. In Rex v. Jackson, 25 Howell's St. Tr. 886, the prisoner
</p>
<p>pleaded without a copy of the indictment, but the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>conceded his right to have the caption read. The Act defines the
</p>
<p>purpose for which the copy of the indictment was to be furnished,
</p>
<p>viz., to enable the party accused to defend himself. And Sir Michael

</p>
<p>Foster, in page 229, particularly refers to this object of the Statute,
</p>
<p>and states that a copy of the caption is necessary to enable him to
</p>
<p>defend himself. The object of the 60 Geo. III. c. 4, under which
</p>
<p>we apply, was substantially the same as that of the Statute of Will.
</p>
<p>III. Sec. 8 enacts : "That in all cases of prosecution for mis-
</p>
<p>" demeanors, the Court shall, if required, make order that a
</p>
<p>" copy of the information or indictment shall be delivered, after
</p>
<p>" appearance, to the party prosecuted, upon application made for
</p>
<p>" the same, free from all expense to the party so applying."
</p>
<p>the privilege given by this Statute is somewhat larger than that given
</p>
<p>by the Statute of Treasons, for it gives the copy without expense.
</p>
<p>The words, though not exactly, are substantially the same in both Sta-
</p>
<p>tutes. The words of the Statute of Treasons are, "a true copy of the
</p>
<p>whole indictment." Those in the 60 Geo. III., are "a copy of the
</p>
<p>indictment." The word " true " cannot make any difference, because
</p>
<p>it is not a copy, unless it is a true one ; and the word " whole " can-
</p>
<p>not make the slightest difference, as is apparent, when you consider
</p>
<p>43*
</p>
<p>the antecedent practice, and the context of the Act itself. In 1 Chit-
</p>
<p>ty, Crim. Law, 405, it is said: "Although these Acts mention only
</p>
<p>" * the whole indictment,' the prisoner ought to have a copy of the
</p>
<p>" caption also delivered to him, for this is necessary to enable him to
</p>
<p>" conduct himself in pleading as the other, and such is now the constant
</p>
<p>" practice.'' The Legislature did not intend that the person indicted
</p>
<p>should have a copy of the names of the witnesses, and we may thus
</p>
<p>account for the omission of the word " whole '' in the latter Statute.
</p>
<p>But the omission of it cannot affect the present case. It is therefore
</p>
<p>plain, that the same thing was intended to be given by the Statute of
</p>
<p>7 Will. III. c. 4, and the Statute 60 Geo. III. c. 4. At common
</p>
<p>law, the traversers in misdemeanor cases had a right to imparl. This
</p>
<p>right of general imparlance was abolished by the 60 Geo. III. c. 4,
</p>
<p>and instead of that, it directed that the traversers should have a copy
</p>
<p>of the indictment free of expense. That valuable privilege of impar-
</p>
<p>lance having been taken away from the traversers, the Court should
</p>
<p>take care that they should have the full benefit of that privilege which
</p>
<p>was substituted for it. Previous to the Statute, the party indicted was
</p>
<p>entitled to have the indictment read slowly, once or twice, in order that
</p>
<p>he might take a note of it. Hawk. P.O., b. 2, c. 4. 1 Chitty C. L.,
</p>
<p>403. Bacon's Abridg., Indictment G., and instead of that, the Statute
</p>
<p>gave a copy of the indictment in order that he might plead or demur.
</p>
<p>How can he plead or demur to the caption, if he is not furnished with
</p>
<p>a copy of it ? I need not enter into the wide field of objection which
</p>
<p>may be taken to the caption of an indictment. It is sufficient to say,
</p>
<p>that objections may be taken to it, and that the Court may, if it
</p>
<p>think those objections good, quash the indictment. This was one
</p>
<p>reason why the Judges, in Greg's case, decided that a copy of the
</p>
<p>caption should be furnished. From the earliest period, it has been
</p>
<p>the practice to give a copy of the indictment in cases of misdemean-
</p>
<p>or, and the caption was included in it, because it was essential in
</p>
<p>order to enable the party to plead or demur, that he should be fur-
</p>
<p>nished with a copy of the caption. For these reasons, and upon these
</p>
<p>authorities, I submit that my client is entitled to a copy of the cap-

</p>
<p>tion of this indictment.
</p>
<p>The ^Attorney- General.  Before I advert to the analogy which
</p>
<p>it has been attempted to draw between the Statute of Treason
</p>
<p>and the 60 Geo. III., and to the determination "of the Judges
</p>
<p>in Greg's case, I wish to call your Lordships' attention to the
</p>
<p>circumstance that it has never been the practice in misdemeanors
</p>
<p>to give a copy of the caption of the indictment. In point of fact
</p>
<p>there is at present no caption in existence. In 2 Hale P. C. 165, it is
</p>
<p>distinctly stated that the caption is no part of the indictment. This
</p>
<p>is further established by the fact that the caption is not made up until
</p>
<p>the end of the term. In the case of Rex v. Faulkner, 1 Saund. 250,
</p>
<p>d., it was decided by Lord Mansfield that the caption is no part of
</p>
<p>the indictment, in conformity with the authority of Lord Hale.
</p>
<p>In that case Lord Mansfield, in delivering judgment, says : " The
</p>
<p>" caption is no part of the indictment ; it is only a copy of the style
</p>
<p>" of the Court at which the indictment is found." The same propo-
</p>
<p>44*
</p>
<p>sition is laid down in 2 Gabbett's Cr. L., 278. In 1 Saunders, 308,
</p>
<p>note 2, is said : " When an inferior court, in obedience to a writ of
</p>
<p>" certiorari, returns an indictment to the K. B., it is annexed to the
</p>
<p>" caption, then called a schedule." The schedule not being a part of
</p>
<p>the indictment, but annexed to the indictment. The same proposi-
</p>
<p>tion is adopted in Archbold's Cr. L., 26, which is the most recent
</p>
<p>treatise on criminal pleading. I therefore submit, on these authori-
</p>
<p>ties, that the caption is no part of the indictment. If that be so the
</p>
<p>traversers are not entitled to a copy of it under the 60 Geo. III.,
</p>
<p>on which this application is founded. With respect to Greg's
</p>
<p>case, which has been relied on on the other side, your Lord-
</p>
<p>ships will find in Bacon's Abridgement, Treason, C. c, the re-
</p>
<p>solution adopted by the judges, and their reasons for adopting
</p>
<p>it. It is thus stated : " That it is the safer way to deliver a copy of the
</p>
<p>caption, as well as of the body of an indictment, for high treason."
</p>
<p>That resolution was not adopted by the judges on the construction
</p>
<p>of the Statute of Treason, but it was conceded thatyb?' safety and in
</p>
<p>favorem vike, by reason of the severe penalties attached to the crime
</p>
<p>of treason. It is quite clear that the same reason does not apply to
</p>
<p>a case of misdemeanor. I have already said that the uniform prac-
</p>
<p>tice has been not to grant a copy of the caption in misdemeanor
</p>
<p>cases. On these grounds I submit that this application should be re-
</p>
<p>fused.
</p>
<p>Sir Cohnan O' Loghlen.  My Lords, we conceive that the tra-
</p>
<p>versers have the right of reply, and that the Solicitor-General should
</p>
<p>now proceed. It was so decided in this Court, in the case of Regina
</p>
<p>x.Gregg, which is not reported.
</p>
<p>The Attorney -General and Mr. Napier.  The right of the Crown
</p>
<p>to reply has been decided, and cannot be now controverted. Regina

<p>V. Jones, Jebb & Bourke, 144 ; Rex v. Kirwan, 31 St. Tr. 543 ; Re-

</p>
<p>Malk., 439.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  The practice in Ireland has always
</p>
<p>been that the Crown is entitled to the reply.

</p>
<p>MONDAY, November 13th.
</p>
<p>Sir Cohnan O' Loghlen My Lords, I am counsel for the Rev.
</p>
<p>P. J. Tyrrell, and I trust I shall show your Lordships that we are en-
</p>
<p>titled to carry our motion, notwithstanding the argument of the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney General. I beg at the commencement to remind your Lordships of
</p>
<p>two facts ; first, this is not an application to enlarge the time to plead,
</p>
<p>or to alter the rules of pleading ; secondly, it is not grounded on the
</p>
<p>right of the traverser alone, but also on an affidavit that it was made
</p>
<p>not for delay. Regularly the caption should be affixed to every in-
</p>
<p>dictment. The Attorney General has stated that the caption is
</p>
<p>never made up until the record is made up, or a certiorari is granted.
</p>
<p>He has cited no authority for that assertion. In point of law, the
</p>
<p>caption ought to be made up as soon as the indictment is found. In
</p>
<p>45*
</p>
<p>cases of treason, it is the practice to give a copy of the caption as
</p>
<p>well as of the indictment. In that case the caption is made up with
</p>
<p>the indictment ; Rex v . Johnson, 6 East, 586. In order to ohtain a
</p>
<p>copy of the caption, the party must apply before plea pleaded.
</p>
<p>In Foster, 230, it is said: "But if the prisoner pleadeth without a
</p>
<p>" copy of the caption, as some of the assassins did, he is too late to
</p>
<p>" make that objection, or indeed any other objection that turneth
</p>
<p>" upon a defect in the copy." The same principle is laid down by
</p>
<p>the Chief Justice, in Rex v. Cooke, 13 How. St. Tr. 330 ; Rex v. Rook-
</p>
<p>wood, 13 Ibid. 161, 1 Leach, Cr. L. 11. From these authorities it is
</p>
<p>clear that the time for making the application for a copy of the cap-
</p>
<p>tion is before plea pleaded, in cases of treason ; and therefore the
</p>
<p>caption should be prefixed to the indictment. It is a principle of the
</p>
<p>common law, that an indictment may be quashed for a defect in the
</p>
<p>caption, not only in treason but in felonies and misdemeanors, Rex v.
</p>
<p>Brown, 1 Lord Raym. 592; 1 Salk. 376 ; Hawk. P. C, B. 2, c.25,
</p>
<p>s. 146. For instance, if it appears that more than twenty-three
</p>
<p>jurors are sworn, or the indictment is found by less than twelve
</p>
<p>jurors, all the authorities agree that the indictment must be quashed.
</p>
<p>My Lords, we are entitled to a copy of the caption on principle, upon
</p>
<p>the construction of the 60 Geo. Ill, and at common law. On
</p>
<p>principle we are entitled to have the- means furnished to make every
</p>
<p>defence which the law allows us. We cannot tell where, when, or
</p>
<p>before whom this indictment is found, without the caption. If the
</p>
<p>indictment is improperly found, or the Court has no jurisdiction, we
</p>
<p>may plead in abatement, of we may move to quash it, or we may
</p>
<p>demur ; 1 Leach, C. L. 425 ; Rex v. Feamley, I T. R. 316 ; Rex v.
</p>
<p>Warren, Strange, 698. Is it not monstrous to say that we may
</p>
<p>plead or demur to the caption, and yet that we are not entitled to a
</p>
<p>copy of it ? How do we know how to frame our plea or demurrer
</p>
<p>without it? In the second place, we are entitled to a copy of the
</p>
<p>caption on the construction of the Statute. The 60 Geo. III. c. 4,
</p>
<p>gives us a right to a copy of the indictment. The word indictment
</p>
<p>has two meanings, a limited original meaning, and a more extended
</p>

</p>
<p>and enlarged meaning. In its original meaning, it is not a record, and
</p>
<p>is defined, "a written accusation of one or more persons of a crime or
</p>
<p>misdemeanor preferred to or presented on oath by a Grand Jury,"
</p>
<p>4 Bl. Com. 301, "an accusation found by an inquest of twelve or
</p>
<p>more, upon their oath," Co. Lit. 126, b. In this sense, I admit that
</p>
<p>the caption forms no part of it. But there is besides, a larger and
</p>
<p>more extended meaning, viz. : a written accusation of record, and in
</p>
<p>that sense the caption is a part of the indictment. It is considered
</p>
<p>in that sense by Sergeant Hawkins, in Book 2, c. 25, sec. 46. He
</p>
<p>considers what ought to be the form of the body of the indictment,
</p>
<p>and what ought to be the form of the caption of the indictment,
</p>
<p>thereby showing clearly, that in his opinion an indictment of record
</p>
<p>consists of two independent, distinct parts, the body and the caption.
</p>
<p>This meaning is adopted in Rex v. Smith, 8 B. & Cr. 341. There
</p>
<p>is express authority to shew that where a Statute gives a copy of an
</p>
<p>indictment, the word is to be taken in that sense, and the caption is
</p>
<p>46*
</p>
<p>included. That was the construction given to the Statute of Trea-
</p>
<p>sons already alluded to; 1 East, P. C. 113, Foster, High Treason,
</p>
<p>229. In Frost's case, a copy of the caption was delivered with the
</p>
<p>indictment. The words of the 60 Geo. III. c. 4, are not exactly the
</p>
<p>same as those of the Statute of Treasons, but there is no substantial
</p>
<p>difference between them. Then, why should a different construction
</p>
<p>be put on them? They both refer to state prosecutions. The At-
</p>
<p>torney-General said, that the construction on the Statute of Trea-
</p>
<p>sons was adopted in favorem vitcB. That is contradicted by all the
</p>
<p>authorities on the subject. Both East and Sir Michael Foster state
</p>
<p>that it was adopted for the purpose of enabling the party to plead or
</p>
<p>demur to the caption. In cases of misdemeanor the party always
</p>
<p>gets a copy of the caption when it is made up. He is entitled to it
</p>
<p>as a matter of right ; Deacon, Indictment ; Rex v. Marsh, 6 Ad. &
</p>
<p>EI. 244. It is the duty of the officer to make up the caption, and if
</p>
<p>he has not done so, the traverser should not be prejudiced by the
</p>
<p>default of the officer, and the Crown should order him to make it up.
</p>
<p>What we seek is a matter of right, ex debito justitice ; and I respect-
</p>
<p>fully submit, that even if your Lordships should feel any doubt on
</p>
<p>the point, you should give the traversers the benefit of that doubt,
</p>
<p>and of an extended construction of the Statute.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor- General.  My Lords, on the part of the Crown,
</p>
<p>it is my duty to resist this innovation, wholly unsupported by princi-
</p>
<p>ple or authority, and which appears to us to be of a dangerous cha-
</p>
<p>racter. I was surprised to hear Sir Colman O'Loghlen assert that
</p>
<p>this is a privilege to which the traverser was entitled at common law.
</p>
<p>There is no authority for that position. The reason why the caption
</p>
<p>is returned with the indictment on a certiorari to an inferior Court
</p>
<p>is to enable the question of jurisdiction to be raised. In the case of
</p>
<p>Rex v. Johnson there was a plea to the jurisdiction, but there is no-
</p>
<p>thing in it to show that the caption was given as part of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment. If the Statute 60 Geo. III. c. 4, is taken up per se, without
</p>
<p>reference to the preceding practice, or to any other Act of Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment, and that the Court had simply to decide on the meaning of the

</p>
<p>word " indictment," not a moment's doubt could be entertained on
</p>
<p>the question. If the Statute had used the words " the record of the
</p>
<p>indictment," according to the distinction taken on the other side, it
</p>
<p>might then have been contended that they included the caption. But
</p>
<p>the word "indictment," of itself does not include the caption. Bac.
</p>
<p>Abridg. Indictment, T. ; Rex v. Atkinson, 1 Saund. 250, b. note 2 ;
</p>
<p>Rex v. Goff, Russ. & Ry. 179. There is another proof that the indict-
</p>
<p>ment and the caption are different things : they are the acts of different
</p>
<p>persons. The indictment is found by the Grand Jury ; the caption
</p>
<p>is the ministerial act of the officer of the Court. The only authority
</p>
<p>which has been relied on for the construction of the Statute con-
</p>
<p>tended for by the other side is the resolution in Greg's case. That
</p>
<p>practice in High Treason was adopted, as it is expressed, for safety ;
</p>
<p>but it was never extended to any other case. Another reason why
</p>
<p>the practice should have been adopted was that, by the 7 Will. III.
</p>
<p>c. 3, sec. 5, a limitation to charges of treason is enacted. The in-
</p>
<p>47*
</p>
<p>diet merit must be found within three years after the offence com-
</p>
<p>mitted, and the caption might be necessary to ascertain whether the
</p>
<p>bill^'was found within that period. The uniform practice and usage
</p>
<p>in this country have been not to grant acopy of the caption, and it has
</p>
<p>always been held to be evidence of the law. The consequences of
</p>
<p>an alteration of the practice would be very dangerous. It would be-
</p>
<p>come the duty of the officer in all cases to make up the record. At
</p>
<p>the Assizes, where the time is limited, that practice would be pro-
</p>
<p>ductive of great inconvenience. I submit, therefore, that this applica-
</p>
<p>tion is not sustained by reason or by authority, that it is contrary to
</p>
<p>the established practice, and should therefore be refused.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  In this case, an application has
</p>
<p>been made on behalf of one of the traversers, the Rev. Peter
</p>
<p>James Tyrrell, for an order, that the caption of the indictment
</p>
<p>against the said Peter James Tyrrell, and] the several other tra-
</p>
<p>versers, should be delivered to the said Peter James Tyrrell, or
</p>
<p>to Mr. Cantwell, his attorney, or that the paper writing purporting
</p>
<p>to be a copy of the indictment, delivered to the said traversers should
</p>
<p>be amended by adding thereto a copy of the said caption. It is to
</p>
<p>be observed, that although this motion purports to be grounded on
</p>
<p>affidavit, and although an affidavit was made which was read by
</p>
<p>counsel on Saturday, and which went to this, that the parties making
</p>
<p>the application did not mean thereby to cause any unnecessary delay,
</p>
<p>yet it makes no peculiar case as a ground of the application. I can
</p>
<p>conceive that certain circumstances might possibly exist, which if
</p>
<p>properly laid before, and duly stated to the Court on affidavit, might
</p>
<p>forcibly and strongly be made use of in order to sustain an applica-
</p>
<p>tion such as the present one. For instance, if there was an allega-
</p>
<p>tion that the indictment was not in point of fact found by a majority
</p>
<p>of the Grand Jury, or that the names of the Grand Jury did not
</p>
<p>appear in the indictment as it stood, so that the party was un-
</p>
<p>able to make his defence. Such subject matter as I have alluded
</p>
<p>to might make a case to be pressed before the Court, to show
</p>
<p>that it might be necessary for his or her defence, that the names of

</p>
<p>all the jurors who found the bill should appear and be set forth, and
</p>
<p>that for that purpose the production of the caption was necessary.
</p>
<p>Such a statement as that would probably induce the Court to comply
</p>
<p>with the application. I do not think that such a state of facts
</p>
<p>exists in this case, I merely put it in order to exemplify the propo-
</p>
<p>sition, that a party might perhaps have made an application of this
</p>
<p>kind with success. But I must take this application, notwithstanding
</p>
<p>the affidavit which has been made, as not being grounded on any
</p>
<p>peculiar circumstances, but as being insisted on, as I understood
</p>
<p>Sir Colman O'Loghlen, as a matter of right, ex debito justitice. The
</p>
<p>majority of the Court are of opinion that it cannot be complied with.
</p>
<p>The case has been argued very much on the analogy of the Statute
</p>
<p>of Treasons, and it is insisted on by reason of the similarity of the word-
</p>
<p>ing in the clause of the Statute of Treasons, and the Statute of the
</p>
<p>60 Geo. III. on which the present proceedings are founded, and the
</p>
<p>Statute of Treasons having received a judicial construction which
</p>
<p>has been acted on by a practice of more than 100 years, that the
</p>
<p>48*
</p>
<p>same construction ought to be given to the Statute now in question,
</p>
<p>the language of the two Statutes not being substantially or mate-
</p>
<p>rially different. I confess that I go very much with the argument
</p>
<p>that there is no substantial distinction in the words made use of in
</p>
<p>the Statute of Treasons, and the words made use of in the present
</p>
<p>Statute. The Statute of Treasons enacted, that the party accused
</p>
<p>should be furnished within a certain time with a true copy of the
</p>
<p>whole of the indictment. The words of the present Statute are,
</p>
<p>that he shall be furnished with the copy of the indictment. I be-
</p>
<p>lieve the Statute of Treasons contains the word "true"  " a true
</p>
<p>copy of the whole of the indictment." The words of the present
</p>
<p>Statute are, " a copy of the indictment." As I said before, I do not
</p>
<p>see any very material or substantial difference between these two
</p>
<p>enactments. But I will observe, that the language of the Statute
</p>
<p>of Treasons has been extended by interpretation beyond their original
</p>
<p>meaning, and it is to be observed also, that though they did receive
</p>
<p>that construction at a meeting of the Judges, yet that in point of
</p>
<p>fact there never was a judicial interpretation to that effect, or to that
</p>
<p>extent, and the language used by the Judges at their meeting was,
</p>
<p>that for safety, it would be better that the accused should have a
</p>
<p>copy of the caption as well as a copy of the indictment. These words
</p>
<p>were used by the Judges in giving a construction to one of the most
</p>
<p>penal Acts of Parliament that was ever passed  an Act of Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment which gave a definition of the crime of high treason, and
</p>
<p>affixes pains and penalties on such an offence. And the Legislature,
</p>
<p>in tender consideration of the dreadful nature of those pains and
</p>
<p>penalties, and punishment inflicted on any person who should come
</p>
<p>within the meaning of that Act, whose life and property would be im-
</p>
<p>plicated and jeopardized by a conviction under it, gave them a copv of
</p>
<p>the indictment. There is therefore no foundation for the assertion of
</p>
<p>counsel, that the construction put on this Act was not in favor em
</p>
<p>vitce. I must say, that when we take into consideration that these facts
</p>
<p>are all recited in the preamble of the Act of Parliament, it is idle to say
</p>
<p>that the doctrine infavorem vitce was not taken into consideration in

</p>
<p>the construction and interpretation of the penal language of this Act.
</p>
<p>The decision, or the construction which has been adopted with re-
</p>
<p>gard to it, the way in which it has been looked upon by the Judges,
</p>
<p>are all very properly brought together and commented on by that
</p>
<p>able lawyer and humane Judge, Sir Michael Foster. Having enu-
</p>
<p>merated the cases by which it is now beyond a doubt established,
</p>
<p>that in cases of treason, under this Act of Parliament, the party ac-
</p>
<p>cused is entitled not only to a copy of the indictment, properly so
</p>
<p>called, but also to a copy of the caption; and after considering the
</p>
<p>topics connected with them, he concludes in these words : " It will
</p>
<p>" not be thought superfluous to have shortly stated how these mat-
</p>
<p>" ters stood at common law, since all high treasons not within the
</p>
<p>" Act, and all felonies, in which 1 include petit treason, stand in
</p>
<p>" these respects upon the footing of common law." I apprehend,
</p>
<p>therefore, that it would be a very unsafe rule indeed, to apply the
</p>
<p>language of that most highly penal Act, the Statute of Treasons, to
</p>
<p>49*
</p>
<p>other cases, and other crimes, which the law has not placed in a
</p>
<p>similar degree of condemnation. The Courts and the Judges have
</p>
<p>been actuated in their construction of the Statute of Treasons, more
</p>
<p>by the extraordinary nature of the pains and penalties enacted by it,
</p>
<p>than by any general rule applicable to all cases of felony or treason
</p>
<p>not within that Act, or that there ought to be a general leaning to
</p>
<p>give the party accused a benefit which that Act of Parliament has
</p>
<p>not provided for. It was never the intention of the law or of the
</p>
<p>Legislature to give in all instances to the accused party, however in-
</p>
<p>convenient or humane it may be considered, the privilege which is
</p>
<p>demanded here as a matter of right, a copy of the caption of the in-
</p>
<p>dictment. At common law, the parties accused were not entitled to
</p>
<p>a copy of the indictment at all. In treasons, not enumerated in the
</p>
<p>Statute of Treasons, and in felonies at common law, they were not
</p>
<p>only not entitled to a copy of the caption, but they were not entitled
</p>
<p>to a copy of the indictment at all; and so the common law stood
</p>
<p>from the earliest times up to the time when Sir Michael Foster wrote
</p>
<p>the passage which I have read, and so the common law stands at this
</p>
<p>day, except in particular cases like those which fall within the range
</p>
<p>of the present Act of Parliament, particular species of misdemeanors
</p>
<p>prosecuted by the Attorney General, where a particular provision is
</p>
<p>made which has some analogy to the Statute of Treasons, but in my
</p>
<p>opinion is not governed by it. At common law, a party accused was
</p>
<p>entitled to, at least there is no instance of his having been refused, a
</p>
<p>copy of the indictment against him, upon paying for it at the office
</p>
<p>of the Clerk of the Crown. I mean in cases of misdemeanor. I have
</p>
<p>the authority of the officer for saying, that a party accused of misde-
</p>
<p>meanor applying for and obtaining, on payment, a copy of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment against him, has never been furnished with a copy of the cap-
</p>
<p>tion ; and 1 believe also the same appears to have been the universal
</p>
<p>practice in the administration of the law in England, up to this
</p>
<p>day. I take it for granted, that if it was otherwise, some one
</p>
<p>or more of the able, acute, and intelligent gentlemen, who appear
</p>
<p>here for the traversers, would on this the second day of the argu-

</p>
<p>ment, have produced a solitary instance to the Court. The very fact
</p>
<p>of the absence of practice in favour of this application, is in my mind
</p>
<p>a demonstration that the construction imposed on the Statute of
</p>
<p>Treason, has never been thought applicable to criminal cases in
</p>
<p>general. There is no intrinsic moral rule which would entitle the
</p>
<p>party accused to call for an alteration in this practice which has ex-
</p>
<p>isted, and has never been overturned from the earliest times. I am
</p>
<p>afraid to make a precedent on such a subject. I cannot see the
</p>
<p>danger or inconvenience which may not follow from this novel in-
</p>
<p>troduction now for the first time asked for ; but it is not difficult to
</p>
<p>suggest some to show the difficulties which would be introduced
</p>
<p>into the administration of criminal justice in this country, if such an
</p>
<p>application as this is to be necessarily acceded to as a matter of
</p>
<p>right. This application is grounded on the 60 Geo. III. and that
</p>
<p>Statute is not confined to the Court of Queen's Bench, but it is
</p>
<p>equally applicale to criminal proceedings at the Commission of Oyer
</p>
<p>H*
</p>
<p>50*
</p>
<p>and Terminer, and to inferior Courts. Section 8 enacts : " that in
</p>
<p>" all cases of prosecutions for misdemeanors, instituted by His Ma-
</p>
<p>" jesty's Attorney or Solicitor-General, in any of the Courts afore-
</p>
<p>" said, the Court shall, if required, make order that a copy of the
</p>
<p>" information or indictment shall be delivered after appearance to
</p>
<p>" the party prosecuted free of expense." The Courts there re-
</p>
<p>ferred to are those mentioned in section 7, and they are Sessions of
</p>
<p>the Peace, Session of Oyer and Terminer, Great Session, or Ses-
</p>
<p>sion of Gaol Delivery. Thus it is open for any person prosecuted
</p>
<p>for misdemeanor by the Attorney or Solicitor-General, not only in
</p>
<p>this Court but in any of those Courts, to apply to be furnished,
</p>
<p>free of expense, with a copy of the indictment? Now if that includes
</p>
<p>the caption, and this new practice is to be introduced against all pre-
</p>
<p>cedent, what inconveniences will not result from it, and how may it
</p>
<p>not embarrass the criminal proceedings at the assizes. There the
</p>
<p>time is limited ; and if the application was to be made at the termi-
</p>
<p>nation of the Commission of Oyer and Terminer, or at the assizes,
</p>
<p>when there is no time by possibility to make up the record, there is
</p>
<p>no end to the inconvenience and danger which might be attendant
</p>
<p>on the introduction of this new precedent without authority, which
</p>
<p>is now for the first time demanded from the Court as a matter of
</p>
<p>light. In point of fact the indictment, properly so called, is quite
</p>
<p>different, perhaps I should not say quite different, but it is essentially
</p>
<p>different from the caption. The indictment is the act of the Grand
</p>
<p>Jury; the caption is not made up at the same time, nor have the
</p>
<p>Grand Jury anything to do with it: it never goes before them at all ;
</p>
<p>it is the ministerial act of the officer of the Court who completes the
</p>
<p>record by the introduction of certain forms which, in point of fact,
</p>
<p>make no part of the charge, but which are only introduced on the
</p>
<p>record when it comes to be made up. At the present time this in-
</p>
<p>dictment is not in a state to furnish the party applying with a
</p>
<p>copy of the caption. It remains in fieri during the whole time,
</p>
<p>or until the record comes to be finally made up, and until that time
</p>
<p>there is, in point of fact, no caption in existence. To comply with

</p>
<p>the present application would be, in point of fact, to order the Clerk
</p>
<p>of the Crown to cause the record to be made up, because there being
</p>
<p>no caption at present he cannot furnish it. It might be v. very dif-
</p>
<p>ferent thing if a particular reason existed to stay the proceedings in
</p>
<p>order to have a special caption made out. Such an application might
</p>
<p>be made if it was founded on justice ; for instance, if the bill had
</p>
<p>only been found by eleven jurors, and a caption was required to be
</p>
<p>made up in order to enable the party to take advantage of that. But
</p>
<p>this application is made as a matter of right, without stating the ob-
</p>
<p>ject of it ; and because a certain construction has been put on the
</p>
<p>Statute of Treasons infavorem vitce, it is insisted that the same con-
</p>
<p>struction ought to be put, although that reason does not apply and
</p>
<p>could not apply to the construction of this Act. I say that, in its
</p>
<p>ordinary sense, the word " indictment" does not include the caption.
</p>
<p>In ordinary language it means something less and different. Iti
</p>
<p>common parlance it is taken for the body of the indictment ; and it
</p>
<p>51*
</p>
<p>rests on the traversers to show that, in the construction of the CO
</p>
<p>Geo. III. c. 4, the ordinary language must be laid aside and the
</p>
<p>meaning, which they contend for, applied. That meaning is different
</p>
<p>from the fact ; both fact and law axe prima facie against it, and in
</p>
<p>opposition to it. The caption is not in existence. The caption there-
</p>
<p>fore cannot be part of the indictment which is in existence, and
</p>
<p>therefore unless they can show that they are entitled to have the same
</p>
<p>construction which was applied to the Statute of Treasons, in its very
</p>
<p>peculiar circumstances, applied to this Statute also, I do not see what
</p>
<p>right they have to say: we will take this word "indictment," and vie will
</p>
<p>use it with a meaning quite different from the common meaning, and
</p>
<p>we will insist that our meaning shall be adopted by the Court. It is
</p>
<p>enough to say, that the universal practice is against it. The Act f
</p>
<p>60 Geo. III. has been in force now upwards of twenty-four years. It
</p>
<p>has been frequently acted on, cases have been brought to trial under
</p>
<p>it in this court, and this is the first lime that the construction now
</p>
<p>contended for was ever thought of. Universal habit and usage are
</p>
<p>against it, because we find that such a demand was never made. Co-
</p>
<p>pies of indictments have been furnished, either under the old rule of
</p>
<p>paying for them to the Clerk of the Crown, or under the provisions
</p>
<p>of this Statute without paying for them ; and up to this hour the uni-
</p>
<p>versal habit and usage have been, not to furnish a copy of the caption.
</p>
<p>There is no rule better settled than that the practice of the Court is
</p>
<p>the law of the Court. The law of the Court is therefore against this
</p>
<p>application, and the law of the Court is the law of the land, not being
</p>
<p>contrary to it. The law therefore is against the application. The
</p>
<p>established practice of both countries is against the application. It
</p>
<p>must therefore be refused.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Burton  The Lord Chief Justice has stated the
</p>
<p>grounds of his judgment, in which I concur so fully, that it is, perhaps,
</p>
<p>quite unnecessary to add anything to what he has stated. I will only
</p>
<p>shortly advert to those grounds, and the rather, because I am bound
</p>
<p>to admit that for some time during the present discussion I was dis-
</p>
<p>posed to entertain a different opinion. It is to be recollected, that

</p>
<p>this is not an application addressed to the discretion of the Court, in
</p>
<p>a particular case, and under particular circumstances, to make an order
</p>
<p>on the Clerk of the Crown to add a caption to the indictment, but an
</p>
<p>application on analleged right to see the caption, and to havethatcaption
</p>
<p>made up expressly for the purpose of being furnished with a copy of
</p>
<p>it ; and this, as it is insisted, under the specific provisions of the Statute
</p>
<p>Law. That is the ground of the application, and on that ground it is
</p>
<p>to be met. It is, I apprehend, clear, that in cases of misdemeanor,
</p>
<p>the party accused has been considered as having a right, at common
</p>
<p>law, to a copy of the indictment (when I say at common law, I mean
</p>
<p>that a practice had prevailed for so great a length of time, that the
</p>
<p>origin of it cannot be known). This right (if right it be) has been
</p>
<p>always exercised in cases of misdemeanor. The accused, if he chose,
</p>
<p>might have a copy of the indictment in all such cases, after the indict-
</p>
<p>ment was found, and at any time before plea pleaded. This might
</p>
<p>probably in the beginning have taken place ex gratia. It has, however,
</p>
<p>52*
</p>
<p>in the progress of time, been so acted upon, as to have obtained the
</p>
<p>character of a right ; but yet, no instance is found of parties, when
</p>
<p>claiming a copy of the indictment, claiming also a copy of the caption.
</p>
<p>At least, there is no instance of an application of this kind having been
</p>
<p>granted as of right. I may observe that there is no doubt as to the
</p>
<p>true meaning of the word caption ; and there is abundant authority to
</p>
<p>show that it is not a part of the indictment  that the indictment is a
</p>
<p>document by itself, and that the caption is a document by itself;
</p>
<p>and where this has been so frequently asserted without contra-
</p>
<p>diction, we may well assume that the caption is in truth an ad-
</p>
<p>dition to the indictment, and not a part of it. Unquestionably,
</p>
<p>the party accused has a right to the copy of the indictment under the
</p>
<p>Statute, under which the application is made, but the caption cannot
</p>
<p>be taken as part of the indictment. I apprehend, therefore, that so
</p>
<p>far as the practice goes on the subject, the accused party is only en-
</p>
<p>titled to a copy of the body of the indictment, not to the caption,
</p>
<p>which is afterwards added to it ; but yet, if a copy of the caption were
</p>
<p>also required upon the ground of its being in the particular instance
</p>
<p>necessary for his defence, the Court would perhaps, under particular
</p>
<p>circumstances, direct the caption to be added to the indictment, and
</p>
<p>give him a copy of it. This may be stated independently of the Statute
</p>
<p>Law. But let it now be supposed that the Statute of Treasons had not
</p>
<p>been passed, but only the Statute of 60 Geo. III., I apprehend that the
</p>
<p>course of the Court being not to annex the caption to the indictment
</p>
<p>as soon as it is found, the party accused could be entitled to the
</p>
<p>copy of the indictment alone, as a matter of right. I say as a matter
</p>
<p>of right, for I do not deny that a case might occur of special circum-
</p>
<p>stances, under which the Court, in the exercise of its discretionTor
</p>
<p>the benefit of the party accused, might give him a copy of the
</p>
<p>caption. The case then is brought to the interpretation of the Sta-
</p>
<p>tute of Treasons, and to the consideration of the exposition that has
</p>
<p>been put on that Statute. That is, whether it has gone the length of
</p>
<p>making the law different in this respect from what it was, inde-
</p>
<p>pendently of that Statute ; in other words, has it given the subject in

<p>all cases in which he is entitled to a copy of the indictment, a copy
</p>
<p>of the caption, and a right to have the caption put upon the record, in
</p>
<p>order that he may have the privilege of a copy of it ; and I own this
</p>
<p>construction pressed on my mind for some time, and in this manner.
</p>
<p>The Statute extended only to offences of treason, and gave the party
</p>
<p>accused a right to a copy of the indictment in express terms. Those
</p>
<p>express terms not including a copy of the caption ; but when the
</p>
<p>Statute came to be considered in a particular case, the Court rea-
</p>
<p>soned on it, in this way, namely, that the case in question was a
</p>
<p>case of high treason, in which the severest punishment is inflicted on
</p>
<p>the party convicted, namely, the punishment of death, together with
</p>
<p>the further consequences of attainder and corruption of blood ; and
</p>
<p>that being so, it was reasonable that the party should have every just
</p>
<p>means of defending himself against it, and thus a copy of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment was granted. Then came the question, whether he ought to
</p>
<p>have a copy of the caption also. That was made the subject of deli-
</p>
<p>beration and consideration by the Judges ; and they came to this re-
</p>
<p>53*
</p>
<p>solution, that under the terms of the Statute, considering it in all its
</p>
<p>operations, it was safe and reasonable that its provisions should be ex-
</p>
<p>tended in point of interpretation to a copy of the caption as well as of
</p>
<p>the indictment. That was the ground upon which the law was estab-
</p>
<p>lished in cases of treason, and it pressed itself strongly on my mind
</p>
<p>that it might not unreasonably be applied to all cases under other
</p>
<p>Statutes. But on further consideration I am satisfied that this in-
</p>
<p>ference has not a sufficient foundation. After full consideration
</p>
<p>therefore, and with the advantage of a deliberation with my Lord
</p>
<p>Chief Justice, and the other members of the court upon the sub-
</p>
<p>ject, I have brought my mind to think that I was mistaken in
</p>
<p>entertaining my first opinion. Let us consider the grounds on
</p>
<p>which this application is put and what it may lead to. In this
</p>
<p>particular Statute, which does not apply to all cases of treason, but
</p>
<p>only to particular treasons there are a number of special provi-
</p>
<p>sions. The judges having determined that the terms of it did not
</p>
<p>comprise the caption of the indictment, concluded that it would be
</p>
<p>the safer course to extend the operation of these words beyond their
</p>
<p>original signification, and to allow a copy of the caption, but it would
</p>
<p>be too much to say, that therefore it was in truth the meaning, and
</p>
<p>that a meaning amounting to a declaration of the Legislature, that in
</p>
<p>all cases then subsisting, or which thereafter might occur, in which
</p>
<p>the party is entitled to a copy of the indictment, he should likewise
</p>
<p>have a copy of the caption, and yet that must be the construction
</p>
<p>and eifect of that resolution of the Judges, if we apply it to this case.
</p>
<p>Consider then the words of the 60 Geo. III. c. 4. It has been
</p>
<p>said and argued very strongly, that the Legislature must be supposed,
</p>
<p>when it made provisions of this kind, to have known what the Statute
</p>
<p>of Treasons was, and inasmuch as the Statute of Treasons gave a
</p>
<p>copy of the indictment, and the caption, so as to make it a part of
</p>
<p>the indictment, that that is to be the construction to be given to
</p>
<p>this Statute which is in the same terms. But I am satisfied, after
</p>
<p>consultation with my brethren, that this is not a true or just way of
</p>
<p>construing such a Statute as this. There can be no question, I think,

</p>
<p>that if the Legislature intended that the party, by the Statute of
</p>
<p>60 Geo. III. c. 4, should get a copy of the indictment with the
</p>
<p>caption added to it, considering the doubts which had been enter-
</p>
<p>tained as to the Statute of Treasons, it would have inserted words
</p>
<p>in this subsequent Statute to this effect, that the party should have a
</p>
<p>copy of the caption as well as a copy of the indictment. I cannot
</p>
<p>think myself entitled to add to the clear words of the Statute, to put
</p>
<p>this forced construction on them, justly and properly forced in the
</p>
<p>construction of the Statute of Treasons ; but not just and proper in
</p>
<p>the construction of a subsequent Statute. I think it would be a new
</p>
<p>mode of construing a Statute to do so, therefore I concur in the
</p>
<p>opinion of the rest of the Court, that the party is not entitled in this
</p>
<p>case, under all its circumstances, to have the application complied
</p>
<p>with.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton  I am very unwilling to occupy any
</p>
<p>portion of the public time, which is now so valuable in this Court, by
</p>
<p>54*
</p>
<p>attempting to do any thing more than express my concurrence in
</p>
<p>what has fallen from my Lord Chief Justice and my brother Burton
</p>
<p>in delivering their opinions, especially as the sentiments which I en-
</p>
<p>tertain on the subject have been thrown out by me in the course of
</p>
<p>the argument : but as my brother Perrin differs from the rest of the
</p>
<p>Court, I think it right to state shortly the grounds on which my opi-
</p>
<p>nion is founded. I agree with my Lord Chief Justice in the conclu-
</p>
<p>sion at which he has arrived. I think this motion is one without
</p>
<p>precedent in a matter very likely to have furnished many precedents,
</p>
<p>if the right which has been so strongly contended for on the part of
</p>
<p>the traversers had existed. I think the application has been properly
</p>
<p>termed an innovation. It is not only without precedent but against
</p>
<p>all practice. I except, of course, the case of treason, which stands
</p>
<p>upon its own peculiar grounds. The Statute on which the motion
</p>
<p>is founded has been law in Ireland for twenty-four years. There
</p>
<p>have not been, it is true, a great many state prosecutions during that
</p>
<p>period, but there have been several in which very able counsel have
</p>
<p>been concerned, and which were much contested, and such an appli-
</p>
<p>cation as this was never thought of. But the actual practice extends
</p>
<p>much beyond that time. It has been stated by the traversers' counsel
</p>
<p>that the course was at all times, in cases of misdemeanors, both in
</p>
<p>England and Ireland, for the Clerk of the Crown, or the officer, to
</p>
<p>furnish the traversers with a copy of the indictment, and that such
</p>
<p>copy included the caption. There is no reason to arrive at that con-
</p>
<p>clusion. On the contrary, the early practice in England, as well as
</p>
<p>the uniform practice in Ireland, seems to be the other way. I have
</p>
<p>now before mean old precedent, Cavendish's case, Anderson, 156, in
</p>
<p>which a copy of an indictment is set out, and that copy does not in-
</p>
<p>clude the caption. And no authority or precedent has been shown to
</p>
<p>support the position. Again, it is urged that, under the Statute of
</p>
<p>the 60 Geo. III. c. 4, the traversers are entitled to this motion. But it
</p>
<p>appears to me that neither as a matter of right, nor of discretion, are
</p>
<p>the traversers entitled to this motion. As to any exercise of dis-
</p>
<p>cretion on the subject, unless it be for the purpose of delay, the tra-

</p>
<p>versers can suggest no benefit from their carrying this motion. Indeed,
</p>
<p>if we have a discretion to exercise, we have no documents before us
</p>
<p>showing any special ground why this motion should be granted. If
</p>
<p>there be no such ground, why should we make this innovation  this
</p>
<p>precedent, which may be attended, in cases at the Assizes, with very
</p>
<p>injurious consequences ? But, let us see what it is that the parties
</p>
<p>complain of, and what they want ? They complain that they have
</p>
<p>not been furnished, according to the order of the Court, with a full
</p>
<p>copy of the indictment, but they say that the copy furnished to them
</p>
<p>is imperfect, and defective in a material part, which ought to have
</p>
<p>been supplied  namely, the caption. The application is at first
</p>
<p>brought forward as a complaint against the officer, charging him with
</p>
<p>not having complied with the order of the Court. But in point of
</p>
<p>fact, the officer is in no default  there was not, and there is not now
</p>
<p>any caption in existence. The officer has furnished the traversers
</p>
<p>with a copy of all that he had. The traversers knew this. They were
</p>
<p>55*
</p>
<p>charged with the indictment in open Court. It was read to them, not
</p>
<p>at length certainly, but the clerk of the Crown commenced at the be-
</p>
<p>ginning, and read on until one of the traversers stopped him. The
</p>
<p>indictment had then no caption ; and these parties who heard the in-
</p>
<p>dictment so read, without a caption, now complain that the officer has
</p>
<p>furnished them with an imperfect copy of that which they so heard
</p>
<p>read. Is it possible, under these circumstances, that the traversers did
</p>
<p>not know that the document with which they were furnished was a per-
</p>
<p>fect copy, at the time they served this notice and made this appli-
</p>
<p>cation ? And if so, can this application be sustained upon this notice?
</p>
<p>Is it a motion for a full copy of the indictment, as is argued, or is
</p>
<p>it really, though not avowedly, a motion for further time to plead.
</p>
<p>But secondly, it is said, the notice may be informal, but substantially
</p>
<p>what the parties meant to move for was, that the officer should be
</p>
<p>ordered by the Court, to add to the top of the indictment, a formal
</p>
<p>caption, and that he should make out a copy of the indictment, with
</p>
<p>this formal caption, and furnish them with that copy. But this view
</p>
<p>of the motion admits that the officer is not in default ; the order has
</p>
<p>been complied with, and the traversers have had a perfect copy of
</p>
<p>the indictment. Then, supposing they had moved for a copy of the
</p>
<p>caption, are they entitled to it ? Not certainly under the order to
</p>
<p>furnish a copy of the indictment, unless the caption be a part of the
</p>
<p>indictment. Now, the uniform practice in all our criminal Courts
</p>
<p>(except in cases of treason) is not to affix any caption to a single in-
</p>
<p>dictment, but to make up a general caption applicable to every pre-
</p>
<p>sentment. That is the course of the Court, and yet the application
</p>
<p>is made, as at first moved, against the officer, under the circumstances
</p>
<p>which I have stated  as if the order of the Court had not been com-
</p>
<p>plied with, as if the officer had given an imperfect copy when the
</p>
<p>Court had ordered a perfect one. In point of fact, the copy is as
</p>
<p>full as the original. This application, in this view of it, is founded
</p>
<p>on the assumption which was strongly put forward by one of the
</p>
<p>counsel who argued the case for the traversers, Mr. Macdonagh, that
</p>
<p>the caption is part of the indictment. Now, if there be one thin*

</p>
<p>established in law better than another, it is, that the caption is no
</p>
<p>part of the indictment ; See Hale, 2 P. C. 165.
</p>
<p>Mr. Macdonagh.  Your Lordship misunderstood me ; I did not
</p>
<p>mean to argue that the caption is a part of the indictment.
</p>
<p>Mr.JusTiCECRAMPTON.  Whatever the argument may have been,
</p>
<p>its foundation upon this notice is, that the caption is part of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment. If it is not, what right has the party to say that he has been fur-
</p>
<p>nished with a part of the indictment only, and not with the whole of
</p>
<p>it? According to the authorities, the caption is no part of the in-
</p>
<p>dictment. In the contemplation of the law, it never was held to be
</p>
<p>so. In some elementary works, it may have been called a part of
</p>
<p>the indictment, but legally it is not so. What is an indictment ? It
</p>
<p>is a bill found by the Grand Jury, and by them handed down, in the
</p>
<p>view of the Court, with the attestation of the foreman, for himself
</p>
<p>and fellows. The caption may be made up in any part of the term.
</p>
<p>The caption, therefore, is not found by the Grand Jury, and is no
</p>
<p>56*
</p>
<p>part of the indictment. It is only evidence that the indictment has
</p>
<p>been found by the Grand Jury ; and when the record is made up,
</p>
<p>and a copy of the record so made up is furnished, the caption will
</p>
<p>appear, and may perhaps then be called part of the indictment. The
</p>
<p>learned counsel who so ingeniously argued this case, have read the
</p>
<p>preamble of the Statute of Treasons, as if it was incorporated with
</p>
<p>the Statute 60 Geo. III. c. 4. That is the gist of the argument on the
</p>
<p>preamble in this Statute. The preamble recites the delays occa-
</p>
<p>sioned by the existing practice in relation to the administration of
</p>
<p>justice in cases of misdemeanor, and the necessity of the interfe-
</p>
<p>rence of the Legislature, to obviate those delays. That is a question
</p>
<p>we have nothing to do with. Then what says the Statute ? " That
</p>
<p>in all such cases," that is, in all cases of prosecution for misde-
</p>
<p>meanor, by his Majesty's Attorney or Solicitor General, " the Court
</p>
<p>" shall, if required, make an order that a copy of the information
</p>
<p>" or indictment shall be delivered, after appearance, to the parly
</p>
<p>" prosecuted, or his clerk in court, or attorney, upon application
</p>
<p>" made for the same, free of all expense to the party so ap-
</p>
<p>" plying ; provided that such party, or his clerk in court, or
</p>
<p>" attorney, shall not have previously received a copy thereof."
</p>
<p>Now, how are we to understand this? Where I find the word "in-
</p>
<p>dictment" used in the Statute, does it mean an indictment as the law
</p>
<p>interprets the word, or does it mean the indictment and caption ? It is
</p>
<p>perfectly clear, if the word " copy "stood alone, no human being could
</p>
<p>possibly draw the inference that it was intended that the caption
</p>
<p>should be furnished; the caption being no part of the indictment at
</p>
<p>all, any more than the witnesses names on the back of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment are part of it ; but the caption being the act of the officer, giving
</p>
<p>the evidence that the bill has been turned into an indictment by the
</p>
<p>Grand Jury, it is impossible to draw any other than this conclusion
</p>
<p>from it. Then it is to be observed that this Act of Parliament was
</p>
<p>passed with reference to misdemeanors only, and the Legislature
</p>
<p>must have known that the practice at the time was to furnish a copy
</p>
<p>of the indictment, strictly and properly so called, and not of the cap-

</p>
<p>tion, and accordingly the Act of Parliament was so framed. Then it
</p>
<p>is said that a copy of the caption is supplied in cases of treason, and
</p>
<p>that a like interpretation should be applied to this Act of Parliament.
</p>
<p>The Act of Treason stands alone. It is an excepted case. It is
</p>
<p>applicable to some treasons only, but never to felonies or misdemean-
</p>
<p>ors. The practice in felonies was to give no copy at all ; in misde-
</p>
<p>meanors, to give a copy of the indictment, but not of the caption.
</p>
<p>The practice since the Statute of Treasons has been to give both in
</p>
<p>particular cases, where the emergency of the case and reason re-
</p>
<p>quired it. The Judges, in Greg's case, did not, as my Lord Chief
</p>
<p>Justice has observed, put a construction on the Statute. Their reso-
</p>
<p>lution was not intended as a construction on the Statute of Treason,
</p>
<p>although the practice which was adopted by that resolution has been
</p>
<p>followed ever since Greg's case. The Judges had met for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of considering what was to be done in the first case which
</p>
<p>had arisen under the Statute. There is something special in the
</p>
<p>words of that Statute, and I quite agree with the counsel for the
</p>
<p>traversers that the words " whole indictment" in the one Statute,
</p>
<p>and " indictment" in the other, may mean the same thing, and that
</p>
<p>both expressions should be equally turned to the prisoner's advan-
</p>
<p>tage, in the case of an offence the most serious for which he could
</p>
<p>be tried. The Judges then considered whether a copy of the cap-
</p>
<p>tion should be furnished, and it was held to be safer to deliver a copy
</p>
<p>of the caption with the indictment, but not as part of the indictment.
</p>
<p>The reason suggested by the Solicitor-General seems entitled to
</p>
<p>some consideration. I shall nut dwell upon this ; but there is a
</p>
<p>manifest distinction between the two Acts of Parliament, which ought
</p>
<p>never to be lost sight of in arriving at a conclusion on this subject.
</p>
<p>The Statute of Treasons requires that the prisoner shall be put in
</p>
<p>possession of the indictment for the purpose of enabling him to plead,
</p>
<p>and before he is put to plead. The Judges in England argued
</p>
<p>thus : " Here is a case of life and death, and it is safer that the
</p>
<p>" prisoner should have a copy of the caption as well as of the in-
</p>
<p>" dictment ;" not thereby interpreting the word " indictment" in the
</p>
<p>Statute as including the caption, but that, as a rule of practice,
</p>
<p>it was safer that the prisoner should have a copy of the caption,
</p>
<p>and accordingly in cases of treason, it has become a rule of prac-
</p>
<p>tice which has been uniformly adopted from that period to the
</p>
<p>present. But it is merely a rule of practice, and is not a con-
</p>
<p>struction of the Statute. It was a humane rule, adopted for the
</p>
<p>benefit of the prisoner, where his life was in jeopardy ; that it
</p>
<p>was safer that he should have a copy of the caption with the in-
</p>
<p>dictment, to enable him to plead and prepare his defence. That was
</p>
<p>the state of the law with respect to treason, and the Legislature did
</p>
<p>not intend that any new construction should be put on the word " in-
</p>
<p>dictment" in the Statute now in question. It is not enacted, that the
</p>
<p>caption shall be a part of the indictment, or that the prisoner shall
</p>
<p>have a copy of the caption to enable him to plead. The Legislature,
</p>
<p>in enacting this Statute, seems to have had two different, and, as it
</p>
<p>were, contrary intentions to carry into effect. The one was in a spirit
</p>
<p>of humanity to make a prosecution, especially in a case of a highly

</p>
<p>penal nature, as little oppressive to, and as protective of the prisoner
</p>
<p>as possible, and the other was an intention or disposition on the part
</p>
<p>of the Legislature, to prevent all unnecessary and technical objections
</p>
<p>which were intended to evade, to frustrate or delay the administration
</p>
<p>of justice. It was difficult to find language adapted to both these in-
</p>
<p>tentions, but both seem to have been equally in the contemplation of
</p>
<p>the Legislature. The Statute of Treasons is one which should receive as
</p>
<p>large a construction as its provision will admit of in favour of a prisoner.
</p>
<p>On the other hand many of the later Statutes were framed with the
</p>
<p>view of taking away all captious objections and all pleas of such a nature
</p>
<p>as lead, not to justice, but to a delay or frustration of it. This Act of
</p>
<p>Parliament belongs rather to the latter than to the former class. It
</p>
<p>might have followed the Statute of Treasons, and said that the party
</p>
<p>should plead in four days after he was furnished with a copy of the
</p>
<p>indictment, but the Legislature appears to have avoided that course,
</p>
<p>i*
</p>
<p>58*
</p>
<p>and said that (lie party should have four days to plead from the
</p>
<p>time when he shall have heard the indictment read in open Court,
</p>
<p>and shall have been charged with it. He has an option to call for a
</p>
<p>copv of the indictment if he pleases. A party indicted for treason
</p>
<p>must have a copy of the indictment, but here an option is given to
</p>
<p>the party whether he will have a copy of the indictment ; but whether
</p>
<p>he has or not, he must plead within four days from the time when
</p>
<p>he has appeared in Court. It is manifest, when we consider the
</p>
<p>objects of the Statute, that the Legislature considered that a party
</p>
<p>indicted for treason should have a copy of the indictment before
</p>
<p>him to enable him to plead, and it is manifest also that the Legis-
</p>
<p>lature considered that in misdemeanors it was sufficient for a party
</p>
<p>to hear the indictment read to enable him to plead, and besides, he
</p>
<p>was to have a copy of the indictment free of expense, at any time
</p>
<p>he thought fit to call for it, not in four days, or before plea pleaded,
</p>
<p>but at any time. These are material distinctions between the two
</p>
<p>Statutes. They are not in pari materia. Their language is not the
</p>
<p>same, their preambles are not the same ; they are different in every
</p>
<p>point of view. An interpretation has been put on one of them,
</p>
<p>growing out of a continued practice, which is not applicable to the
</p>
<p>other. My opinion, therefore, is that this is an application clearly
</p>
<p>deserving the name of an innovation ; that it is one against the prac-
</p>
<p>tice, and therefore against the law of the court; an application against
</p>
<p>principle, and likely to be attended with inconvenience to the due
</p>
<p>administration of justice ; an application, as my Lord Chief Justice
</p>
<p>bas truly said, unnecessary, according to the affidavits which have
</p>
<p>heen made on the present occasion, for the traversers have stated no
</p>
<p>ground whatever why it should be granted, save one which is not a
</p>
<p>true one, namely, that the officer has given an imperfect copy of the
</p>
<p>indictment. For those reasons my opinion is, that the application
</p>
<p>should be refused.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin.  I am of opinion that this application
</p>
<p>ought to be complied with, and that the accused ought to have a copy
</p>
<p>of the caption of the indictment, in order that he may advise with

<p>his counsel to plead and make his defence. The Statute which has
</p>
<p>been referred to, the 60 Geo. III. c. 4, which abridges the exist-
</p>
<p>ing rights of persons prosecuted for misdemeanor, deprives them of
</p>
<p>imparlance to the following term, and obliges them to plead or demur
</p>
<p>within four days from the time of appearance, after they shall be

<p>secution for misdemeanor, instituted by his Majesty's Attorney or

<p>Solicitor-General, in order to enable the party prosecuted to meet

<p>this new state of things, and condition in which he is placed, that the
</p>
<p>Court shall, if required, order a copy of the indictment or information
</p>
<p>to be delivered free of expense to him or his attorney, on demand. For
</p>
<p>what purpose was it to be furnished ? For his defence. And for that

<p>Lord Holt, applied to the Statute of Treasons, to advise with his counsel
</p>
<p>on the plea which should be pleaded. " Though this mentioneth only
</p>
<p>" the copy of the indictment, yet he ought to have a copy of the cap-
</p>
<p>59*
</p>
<p>" lion delivered to him with the indictment, for this, in many cases, is
</p>
<p>w * as necessary to enable him to conduct himself in pleading as the
</p>
<p>" other."  Foster, 229. Accordingly this application has heen mainly
</p>
<p>supported on analogy of the enactments of this Statute to those
</p>
<p>of the Statute 5 Geo. III. c.2l, Irish, and the Statute 7 Will. III.
</p>
<p>c.3.1, and 7 Anne, c. 21, English, upon which Statutes it has been held
</p>
<p>uniformly by the Judges ever since the passing of them, that the party
</p>
<p>accused was entitled not only to the body of the indictment, but also to a
</p>
<p>copy ofthe caption of the indictment. They were not, as this is, enacted
</p>
<p>to abridge the rights of the accused. It is a mistake to say that they
</p>
<p>required to be liberally construed, because they inflicted deprivation
</p>
<p>and disadvantage. On the contrary, they enlarged the rights of the
</p>
<p>party accused, and conferred upon him distinct and new advantages,
</p>
<p>to such a degree that, in the opinion of Bishop Burnet, as quoted by
</p>
<p>Sir Michael Foster, " the design of it (7 Will. III. c. 3) seemeth to
</p>
<p>be to make men as safe in all treasonable practices as possible ;" and
</p>
<p>yet the Judges, in putting a construction thereon, held the accused
</p>
<p>had a right to a copy of the caption as well as the body of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment. A good deal of argument has been advanced on one side and
</p>
<p>on the other, as to whether the caption is part of the indictment or
</p>
<p>not. Though the learned counsel who opened the case for the tra-
</p>
<p>versers has latterly expressly disclaimed the intention to argue that it
</p>
<p>was a part ofthe indictment  on what ground he has not informed
</p>
<p>the Court  but on looking into the authorities to which we have
</p>
<p>been referred, and the view taken by learned Judges and able writers
</p>
<p>who are considered as authorities, I doubt very mnch the soundness
</p>
<p>of that disclaimer. I find in 2 Hawkins' Pleas ofthe Crown, in chap-
</p>
<p>ter 25, on indictments (it is a work of high authority, and the writer
</p>
<p>has never been supposed to have taken a view too favourable to the
</p>
<p>rights ofthe accused), in the commencement ofthe chapter, this
</p>
<p>definition of an indictment : " An indictment is an accusation at
</p>
<p>" the suit of the King, by the oaths of twelve men of the
</p>
<p>" same county wherein the offence was committed, returned to
</p>
<p>" inquire of all offences in general, in the county, determinable by

</p>
<p>' the court into which they are returned, and finding a bill brought
</p>
<p>" before them to be true." The indictment is not merely a record,
</p>
<p>or instrument in writing, containing the facts constituting the charge,
</p>
<p>but it is a finding by twelve men. In his analysis of the particulars
</p>
<p>to be considered, in this chapter on indictment, he enumerates
</p>
<p>amongst them: "6. Who may and ought to be indictors ; 8. Ofthe
</p>
<p>" form of the body of the indictment ; 9. Of the form of the caption
</p>
<p>" of the indictment." It is not only an accusation, but it is and be-
</p>
<p>comes so as a finding by twelve competent qualified men ; and ac-
</p>
<p>cordingly, we find that when the party is called upon to plead to the
</p>
<p>indictment, if the caption shows that it is not a finding by twelve
</p>
<p>such men, or leaves it uncertain whether it is a finding by twelve
</p>
<p>men, he may demur to it. It is not then an indictment, and he is
</p>
<p>not called on to answer it. Why? Because it is not a finding by
</p>
<p>twelve men. If it appear that the Grand Jurors are not men belong-
</p>
<p>ing to the county, he may also demur. Their incompetency or dis-
</p>
<p>60*
</p>
<p>qualification, on various grounds, may be the subject of a plea in
</p>
<p>abatement : and unless he know when, where, and by whom the bill
</p>
<p>is found, he has not the means of pleading such special matter with
</p>
<p>advantage. It therefore appears to me that, as I have been in the
</p>
<p>habit of thinking, the indictment consists of two parts, the body and
</p>
<p>the caption. It so appears throughout that chapter in Hawkins, and
</p>
<p>I refer particularly to pages 287, 809, 346', and 349, and he is not
</p>
<p>contradicted by any authority that I have been able to find. With
</p>
<p>respect to that passage cited from the case of The King v. Atkinson,
</p>
<p>in the note to Saunders' Reports, 250 (a?), it can hardly be held that
</p>
<p>Lord Mansfield meant to go the length of holding that the caption is
</p>
<p>no part of the indictment. The question in that case was, whether an
</p>
<p>incorrect copy of the caption returned might be amended, according
</p>
<p>to the truth and conformably to the original caption ; a copy which
</p>
<p>was incorrect by the mere blunder of the officer, who was only mi-
</p>
<p>nisterial in making the act, as Lord Mansfield says ; he does add,
</p>
<p>that "the caption is no part of the indictment; it is only a copy
</p>
<p>of the style of the court at which the indictment is found." So far
</p>
<p>he is correct, that it is no part of the finding or act of the jury.
</p>
<p>I cannot consider this dictum an authority to that extent, in express
</p>
<p>opposition to Hawkins, for in that very case, the question, whether
</p>
<p>there were a sufficient indictment, depended on the contents of
</p>
<p>the caption. Suppose it does go that length, it is, after all, but
</p>
<p>the dictum of Lord Mansfield, and I should say, against the reason
</p>
<p>of the thing as well as the authorities. The ancient course was for the
</p>
<p>jury to find the bare facts, and for the officer to put them into form.
</p>
<p>It is unjust to say, that Lord Mansfield was laying it down as an ab-
</p>
<p>solute proposition, that the caption is in no point of view, part of the
</p>
<p>indictment, for that was not the decision in the case. It is said, as I
</p>
<p>have before observed, that the copy of the indictment is furnished, in
</p>
<p>order that the accused may advise with his counsel how he may be
</p>
<p>enabled to plead. Unless he knows what the matter of fact is, how
</p>
<p>can he plead ? How can he have the advantage of pleading the
</p>
<p>special matter to the caption, if he is ignorant of its contents ? It

</p>
<p>has been suggested as an objection to this application, that the party
</p>
<p>is calling on the Court, in this early part of the Term, to give that
</p>
<p>which is only completed at the end of the Term. That if an answer
</p>
<p>in this case would be an answer in high treason as well as in misde-
</p>
<p>demeanor. The same difficulty would occur in both cases. But in
</p>
<p>my mind he is only calling on the Court to have that done which
</p>
<p>ought to have been done, and which from mere neglect has grown
</p>
<p>into disuse. I do not mean to attach blame to the officer of the
</p>
<p>Court in this particular instance, but in strictness it is his duty to
</p>
<p>enter the proceedings of the Court de die in diem, and so it would
</p>
<p>appear from the record when it is made up. For the caption is
</p>
<p>entered as of the first day of the term. There is no inconvenience
</p>
<p>in this course. There may be, it is true, several indictments found
</p>
<p>on several days in the term, but if any thing special occurs, the cap-
</p>
<p>tion may and ought to be framed accordingly. Another objection
</p>
<p>has been urged, namely, that this application is contrary to the prac-
</p>
<p>61*
</p>
<p>tice of the Court ; that the copy of the caption is not given in prac-
</p>
<p>tice by the officer of the Court, and that the practice of the
</p>
<p>Court is the law of the Court. No doubt that it is the law, but
</p>
<p>I have not heard of any instance of a rule, or even of a dictum
</p>
<p>of a Judge before today, in favour of the position that the party is not
</p>
<p>entitled, under this Statute, to what has been demanded at the bar.
</p>
<p>1 have not heard of one instance in which an application such as the
</p>
<p>present one has been refused. I cannot consider that because the
</p>
<p>objection has not been made, for the case has not arisen during the
</p>
<p>twenty-four years which have elapsed since the passing of the Statute,
</p>
<p>that any practice of the court against the application has been shown
</p>
<p>or established to exist. The course of proceeding of the parties in
</p>
<p>the instances, and they are not many, in which crown prosecutions
</p>
<p>have occurred, many have been for the party to make an application
</p>
<p>to the officer of the Court, who may have refused to give a copy of
</p>
<p>the caption of the indictment, and the parties may have submitted
</p>
<p>without remonstrance. But I cannot imagine that because the ques-
</p>
<p>tion never was raised before, even if an occasion for raising it had oc-
</p>
<p>curred, that, therefore, this is to be considered as the practice of the
</p>
<p>Court, binding the Court as law. But then there is another practice
</p>
<p>adverted to, and that is the practice at the Assizes, where it is said
</p>
<p>to have been established that, although the party accused is entitled
</p>
<p>(on paying the usual fees) to a copy of the indictment, he is not en-
</p>
<p>titled to a copy of the caption. I never knew an instance in which
</p>
<p>this was discussed, or in which it was even mentioned. But it is not
</p>
<p>in common practice asked for or given. Why ? Because the parties
</p>
<p>apply, at their own expense, for that which is in ordinary cases only
</p>
<p>material, viz., the body of the indictment. They pay for what they
</p>
<p>get, and they do not ask for more than they want. No cases are
</p>
<p>produced in which the caption has been refused where material.
</p>
<p>I do not think that such negative evidence is sufficient to establish
</p>
<p>a practice. These are the grounds on which it appears to me that
</p>
<p>the construction of this Statute ought to be governed by the practice
</p>
<p>under the Statute of 7 William III. c. 3, and 7 Anne, c. 21, in Eng-

<p>land, and 5 Geo. III. c. 21, in Ireland. Of course when I am under
</p>
<p>the disadvantage of differing from the rest of the Court, I must feel
</p>
<p>that there is every probability that I am wrong. But no other dis-
</p>
<p>advantage will ensue, because the rule of the Court will not be ac-
</p>
<p>cording to my opinion.
</p>
<p>[After some discussion on another topic introduced  ]
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin.  My attention has been drawn by my
</p>
<p>brother Crampton to a passage in 2 Hale, PI. Cr. which had escaped
</p>
<p>me, and to which I have not adverted, it is this : " The caption of
</p>
<p>" the indictment is no part of the indictment, but it is the stile or
</p>
<p>" preamble, or return that is made from an inferior Court to a supe-
</p>
<p>" rior, from whom a certiorari issues to remove; or when the whole
</p>
<p>" record is made up in form, for whereas the record of the indict-
</p>
<p>" ment as it stands upon the file of the Court wherein it is taken is
</p>
<p>" only thus: juratores pro doiuino Rpge super Juramentum suorum
</p>
<p>" presentent, when this comes to be returned upon a certiorari is
</p>
<p>62*
</p>
<p>" more full and explicit in this form," &c. Lord Hale does liere
</p>
<p>certainly say the caption is no part of the indictment, but not in the
</p>
<p>sense contended for, nor to the extent, nor that it is not essential to
</p>
<p>the indictment, as appears in the subsequent pages, when he treats
</p>
<p>of the caption and of the body of the indictment ; so that without
</p>
<p>observing as fully upon this passage as I should had it been brought
</p>
<p>to my attention when delivering my opinion, it appears to me sub-
</p>
<p>ject to the same view as Lord Mansfield's position, and so not to ap-
</p>
<p>ply exactly to the matter in argument.
</p>
<p>TUESDAY, November 14th.
</p>
<p>This being the last day for pleading, according to the rules of
</p>
<p>the Court, the following plea was handed in in person by Daniel
</p>
<p>O'Connell, Esq. :
</p>
<p>" And the said Daniel O'Connell, in his own proper person,
</p>
<p>" comes into the Court here of our Lady the Queen, before the Queen
</p>
<p>" herself, and having heard the said alleged indictment read, and pro-
</p>
<p>" testing that he is not guilty of the premises charged in the said
</p>
<p>" alleged indictment, or of any part thereof, for plea in abatement
</p>
<p>" thereto, nevertheless saith that he ought not to be compelled to
</p>
<p>" answer the said alleged indictment, and that the same ought to be
</p>
<p>" quashed, because he saith that the said alleged indictment here-
</p>
<p>" tofore, to wit, on the 2nd day of November, 1843, to wit at the
</p>
<p>" said Court of our Lady the Queen, before the Queen herself, to

</p>
<p>" of Dublin aforesaid, and this he is ready to verify ; wherefore he
</p>

</p>
<p>" quashed, and soforth."
</p>
<p>Similar pleas were handed in by the several other traversers in
</p>
<p>person.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General objected to those pleas being received, as
</p>
<p>at that stage of the proceedings the traversers were not entitled to
</p>
<p>plead in abatement ; he, at all events, applied as a matter to the dis-
</p>
<p>cretion of the Court, that those pleas should not be received, until
</p>
<p>he had an opportunity of considering the question.
</p>
<p>63*
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell, on the part of the traversers, contended that the
</p>
<p>pleas should be then received, and that if the Attorney-General ob-
</p>
<p>jected to them, he could afterwards move to have them set aside.
</p>
<p>The Court postponed hearing the matter discussed until the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing dav, it then being a late hour, without prejudice, however to
</p>
<p>the traversers, if the Court should be of opinion that the pleas should
</p>
<p>have been then received.
</p>
<p>WEDNESDAY, November 15th.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General.  My Lords, the question before the
</p>
<p>Court now is, whether those pleas in abatement which have been
</p>
<p>pleaded by the several traversers, ought to be received, and that will
</p>
<p>be found to depend on the construction of the 60 Geo. III. c. 4, and
</p>
<p>I contend that under that Statute they were bound to plead in abate-
</p>
<p>ment, when charged with the indictment; that has been the practice
</p>
<p>both in felonies and misdemeanors, 1 Chitty, C. L. 447 ; 4 id. 520,
</p>
<p>note ; 2 Gabbett's Cr. L. 328 ; 1 Burns' Justice, Abatement, 2 ; Rex
</p>
<p>v. Kirwan, 31 State Trials, 578. These cases show what the prac-
</p>
<p>tice has been, and the form of the plea is the same in Rex \. Kirwan
</p>
<p>as in this case. But I submit, upon the true construction of the Act,
</p>
<p>it does not apply to pleas in abatement. Looking to the preamble
</p>
<p>of the Act, so far from giving facility to dilatory pleas, it shows that
</p>
<p>such a construction would not be in accordance with its intention, for
</p>
<p>it expressly recites that delays had occurred, and that it is for re-
</p>
<p>medy of those delays the Act was passed; and looking to the latter
</p>
<p>branch of the section, it is clear we are entitled to compel a party to
</p>
<p>plead in that term, in the same manner as he might have done prior
</p>
<p>to the Act, on an imparlance to another term. Now, before the pass-
</p>
<p>ing of the Act, if there had been an imparlance, the party would not
</p>
<p>have been entitled to plead in abatement. Bacon's Abr. Plea, c. 3.
</p>
<p>Under this section, when giving the party four days to plead or de-
</p>
<p>mur, it was never in contemplation that he was to put in a dilatory
</p>
<p>plea. In the ordinary rule of this Court, the eight day rule to plead
</p>
<p>does not permit the party to plead in abatement, or to the jurisdic-
</p>
<p>tion ; that should be pleaded in four days.

</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin  It was only in cases of treason or felony,
</p>
<p>that the party was bound to plead on his arraignment.
</p>
<p>The Attorney- General  If that be so, then this plea is late under
</p>
<p>any circumstances. In civil cases and in misdemeanors, the rule is the
</p>
<p>same, and a dilatory plea should be filed within four ruaning days.
</p>
<p>The rule in this case commenced to run on Friday, and should have
</p>
<p>been filed on Monday, as Sunday counts as one of the four days. It
</p>
<p>is clear then that prior to the passing of the Act, those pleas could
</p>
<p>not have been received. Now what is the construction they seek to
</p>
<p>put on the Act ? They call on you, notwithstanding the preamble
</p>
<p>of that Act, to extend the time for receiving those dilatory pleas,
</p>
<p>which clearly would have been irregular before the passing of the
</p>
<p>64*
</p>
<p>Act. Further, supposing those pleas were received, and I take a
</p>
<p>demurrer to them, it' I succeed on that demurrer, I could only get a
</p>
<p>judgment of respondeat ouster, 1 Chitty's Cr. Law, 451, and accord-
</p>
<p>ing to the construction put upon the Act, by the other side, the
</p>
<p>effect would be, that an Act passed for the purpose of prevent-
</p>
<p>ing delay, would create delay. This is a strong reason to show that
</p>
<p>the pleas thereby meant should be pleas which would lead to a
</p>
<p>final judgment, and not pleas which would lead to a judgment of
</p>
<p>respondeat ouster, and thereby give the parties new time for
</p>
<p>pleading. Further, if a party appears by attorney, there can be no
</p>
<p>imparlance, but the party shall be compelled to plead, and if I be
</p>
<p>right, that there cannot be a plea in abatement, or to the jurisdiction
</p>
<p>after imparlance, this plea does not meet this second branch.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin.  Do you infer from this that a plea in
</p>
<p>abatement is taken away?
</p>
<p>The Attorney- General  No. Either they are to plead on ar-
</p>
<p>raignment, or to plead in four running days. If they are to plead in
</p>
<p>four running days, the Statute has no reference to pleas in abate-
</p>
<p>ment, it has only reference to pleading in bar or demurring, and has
</p>
<p>not the effect of extending the time for pleading.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore  My Lords, if I understand the Attorney-General,
</p>
<p>he is applying for an order that the officer should not receive those
</p>
<p>pleas, and in strictness he is bound not to make that application
</p>
<p>without notice ; but I do not seek to turn him round on this point,
</p>
<p>I submit on principle and on the true construction of this Act,
</p>
<p>that those pleas are regular. There is no controversy, but that
</p>
<p>we had the whole of yesterday to put in pleas of some kind or other.
</p>
<p>The first ground of his argument was, that if the Statute had not
</p>
<p>passed, we are not at liberty to plead in abatement, unless at the
</p>
<p>time of arraignment. It becomes therefore necessary to consider at
</p>
<p>what period a party is said to be arraigned. In 2 Hale, P. C. 219,
</p>
<p>arraignment is the time given to the party as to the period he
</p>
<p>is called on to answer and to say whether he is guilty or not, and
</p>
<p>that time, according to the rules of the Court, did not arrive until

</p>
<p>yesterday, and we were not bound to say whether we would plead
</p>
<p>in bar or in abatement. The second question for the consideration
</p>
<p>of the Court is the construction of the Statute, and whatever doubt
</p>
<p>may have existed antecedent to the Statute, there is not a particle
</p>
<p>of doubt with respect to the right to plead in abatement under the
</p>
<p>Statute. It is clear that at common law in misdemeanor cases, the
</p>
<p>party had a right to imparl to the ensuing term. The Queen v.
</p>
<p>Rawlins, 3 Salk. 185. But then it is said, if we had entered an im-
</p>
<p>parlance we should have been bound not to have pleaded in abate-
</p>
<p>ment. Whatever be the rule in civil cases I know of no authority
</p>
<p>to show that after an imparlance in a criminal case, the party is de-
</p>
<p>prived of his right to plead in abatement. Whatever may be the
</p>
<p>principle applicable to civil cases, the Court would be slow to extend
</p>
<p>the rule to Crown cases, which would have the effect of depriving a
</p>
<p>party of a benefit he would otherwise be entitled to, for a plea in
</p>
<p>abatement may be a plea to the merits; there is no doubt but the
</p>
<p>parties had a great privilege in being allowed to imparl, that right
</p>
<p>65*
</p>
<p>wag given to him to afford him every opportunity in point of time,
</p>
<p>of making himself acquainted with the charge against him. A
</p>
<p>great advantage is thus taken away by the operation of this Act-
</p>
<p>and it is to be considered as a penal Act, because it goes to abridge
</p>
<p>the common law right ; it therefore should receive the fullest in-
</p>
<p>terpretation in favour of the party. It is said, that it appears by the
</p>
<p>preamble, that the Statute was intended to prevent delay ; now the
</p>
<p>object of it was, to do away with the right of imparling, and to sub-
</p>
<p>stitute in its place, that the party be required to plead or demur in
</p>
<p>four days, and you are called on to construe it as if it said, a plea in
</p>
<p>bar in four days. A plea in abatement is as valid as a plea in bar,
</p>
<p>and may go equally to the merits ; and when a common law right is
</p>
<p>taken away, why should a party be deprived of a privilege the Act
</p>
<p>gives him ? Upon no principle can the Court give the Act this narrow
</p>
<p>construction, if the Legislature intended to confine it to pleas in
</p>
<p>bar, they would have inserted those words, but the Court would
</p>
<p>not be warranted in introducing them.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell.  My Lords, on the part of Mr. Ray, I submit,
</p>
<p>that those pleas ought to be received. When on Friday the rule to
</p>
<p>plead was entered, we applied to the Clerk of the Crown to be in-
</p>
<p>formed at what time it was necessary to put in a plea, and we got
</p>
<p>a certificate from him stating, that we had the whole of Tues-
</p>
<p>day, so that if we relied on this certificate alone, this plea ought to
</p>
<p>be received. There is no doubt that at common law, if a party ap-
</p>
<p>peared in person, he had a right to imparl to the next term, but if
</p>
<p>he neglected to appear in proper time, he was deprived of that right,
</p>
<p>1 Gude, Cr. Law, 90 ; Rex v. Cox, 1 Show. 56. This plea is said
</p>
<p>to be a dilatory plea, but it raises a very important question. There
</p>
<p>has been no practice to regulate the construction of this Act, and
</p>
<p>the Court will not, therefore, give it such a construction as will ex-
</p>
<p>clude this plea.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brews ter  My Lords, in reference to the certificate, the offi-
</p>
<p>cer was misled ; he was asked to inform the traversers when the rule
</p>
<p>to plead would run out, but that rule had nothing to say to pleas in

</p>
<p>abatement, and the party when they made this application, should
</p>
<p>have stated whether they intended to plead in abatement or in bar.
</p>
<p>As to the nature of the plea, it is purely a dilatory plea, and does
</p>
<p>not go to the merits of the case. The authorities are clear, that upon
</p>
<p>the civil side of the Court, he has but two days to plead in abate-
</p>
<p>ment, Jennings v. Webb, 1 T. R. 277. Another rule is, that there can
</p>
<p>be no plea in abatement after a general imparlance, Duncombe v.
</p>
<p>Church, 1 Salk. 1 ; Evans v. Stevens, 4 T. R. 227. Pleas in abate-
</p>
<p>ment in criminal cases, are looked on as in civil cases. Under the
</p>
<p>Statute of Anne, they must be verified by affidavit, Rex v. Grainger,
</p>
<p>3 Bur. 1617, and in that Statute, pleas in abatement are called di-
</p>
<p>latory pleas. In misdemeanor, there are two courses not accu-
</p>
<p>rately distinguished, traversing and imparling. The party desiring
</p>
<p>to traverse, when called on to appear, must appear and plead.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin.  My impression is, that when a party ap-
</p>
<p>plies to traverse in prox. he is not called on to plead until the next
</p>
<p>66*
</p>
<p>Term. It has been doubted whether, after a party had pleaded, he
</p>
<p>could traverse inprox. Jicx v.Claxton, 1 C. & Dix, C. C. 183.
</p>
<p>My. Brewster.  In Dickinson, Quarter Sessions, 451, it is stated
</p>
<p>that he is to plead to the indictment before he is entitled to traverse,
</p>
<p>2 Gabbett, 347, however, it is clear that after imparlance he could not
</p>
<p>plead in abatement. But it is said that the Statute has altered the
</p>
<p>law in this respect. The Statute was intended to prevent the post-
</p>
<p>ponement of a trial, and it has taken away the right to imparl.
</p>
<p>After an imparlance there could be no plea in abatement, it was,
</p>
<p>therefore, outside the mischief which the Legislature intended to re-
</p>
<p>medy. This is not a penal Statute, it is a remedial Statute, and if
</p>
<p>the Court has a discretion, it is bound to carry out the inten-
</p>
<p>tions of it. It speaks of pleas and demurrers ; they are both pleas
</p>
<p>in bar ; there is no special demurrer in criminal cases.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice  In this case, the question before
</p>
<p>the Court has been treated and argued, and in point of fact, I con-
</p>
<p>ceive it to be, an application made by the Attorney-General, that
</p>
<p>the respective pleas in abatement which were tendered yesterday
</p>
<p>should not be received. The Attorney-General contends that
</p>
<p>these several pleas, which are all one and the same, are not pleas
</p>
<p>in bar, but pleas in abatement  merely dilatory pleas ; and he
</p>
<p>insists, first, that those being dilatory pleas, the parties were
</p>
<p>bound to have filed or tendered them, if at all, within four run-
</p>
<p>ning days, and he lias argued, that because they were not tendered
</p>
<p>until the fifth day, they are too late by the rule of the Court, and
</p>
<p>ought not to be received. In general terms, if that were so, I should
</p>
<p>say that the present is a case in which this rule ought not to
</p>
<p>be applied. There has been a great deal of dispute and contro-
</p>
<p>versy with regard to what passed at the office of the Clerk of the
</p>
<p>Crown, on the application made to him on the part of the traver-
</p>
<p>sers, as to the time they were bound to plead, but whatever was the
</p>
<p>object, whatever was the intention of the parties, it is perfectly cer-
</p>
<p>tain, that on Saturday a formal application was made as to what
</p>
<p>length of time the parties had to plead, and it is also certain that

</p>
<p>the Clerk of the Crown, being thus seriously applied to, did give
</p>
<p>an answer in writing, that the parties who made the application had
</p>
<p>all Tuesday to put in their plea. I do not see how the Court can
</p>
<p>now give attention to the Attorney-General insisting that Monday
</p>
<p>was the last day, when the officer has given in, under his hand, that
</p>
<p>the parties had all Tuesday to plead. Now if this was a case, which
</p>
<p>generally speaking would be brought under the operation of the
</p>
<p>four-day rule, as being a dilatory plea, in my opinion, after the
</p>
<p>communication made by the officer of the Court, the Attorney-Ge-
</p>
<p>neral could not insist on that rule in this particular instance.
</p>
<p>However, it is necessary to consider tbe case otherwise and further.
</p>
<p>This Court is called on to give an opinion, whether, according to the
</p>
<p>ordinary practice under the Statute 60 Geo. III. c. 4, defendants are
</p>
<p>precluded from putting in a plea in abatement, which has not been
</p>
<p>filed before the regular day for so pleading. Tuesday was the regular
</p>
<p>day for pleading under that Statute, but the Attorney-General says it
</p>
<p>must be taken to be for pleading in bar and not in abatement. If
</p>
<p>67*
</p>
<p>a distinction was intended to be drawn or relied on, when the officer
</p>
<p>was applied to, he should have apprised the parties that that dis-
</p>
<p>tinction existed ; on the contrary, he makes no distinction what-
</p>
<p>ever, but he says, that the time for pleading, making no distinc-
</p>
<p>tion between pleading in bar or in abatement, would be out on
</p>
<p>Tuesday, and that the party would have the whole of Tuesday to
</p>
<p>file his plea. That is another reason why this distinction is
</p>
<p>hardly open to the officer of the Crown. The officer of the
</p>
<p>Court is the person to be applied to, and he gives an answer,
</p>
<p>equivocal, if it is intended to be relied that there is a distinction,
</p>
<p>but perfectly intelligible if there be no distinction. But let us see
</p>
<p>whether under the Statute they ought to be permitted to file the
</p>
<p>plea in question on Tuesday, putting out of view the consideration of
</p>
<p>that general answer given by the Clerk of the Crown, which would
</p>
<p>have a strong tendency to mislead the parties, if they were not at li-
</p>
<p>berty to plead one or other of those pleas. Whatever be the rule
</p>
<p>of the Court in civil cases, I apprehend it has nothing to say to this
</p>
<p>case. Further, with regard to the rule of the Court as applicable to its
</p>
<p>criminal jurisdiction, there appears little or no room for any practice
</p>
<p>to be resorted to under the Statute in question; I have not heard
</p>
<p>stated a single authority in reference to the point upon which
</p>
<p>the Court are called upon to make a decision ; therefore, the prac-
</p>
<p>tice with regard to any particular case, is not applicable as a rule
</p>
<p>of construction. I have already said, I do not see any analogy
</p>
<p>between civil and criminal cases. We are therefore called on to
</p>
<p>see what is the interpretation to be put on this Statute independently
</p>
<p>either of authority or of practice, and we are obliged to resort for
</p>
<p>that construction, to the internal consideration of the thing effected
</p>
<p>by the Act, the privileges of which the traversers are deprived, or
</p>
<p>the benefits conferred by it. It has been truly stated, that the right
</p>
<p>to traverse inprox. was a most valuable privilege, which every person
</p>
<p>under the circumstances stated was entitled to before the Statute had
</p>
<p>passed ; the effect of it was, that a person accused of a misdemeanor
</p>
<p>before the passing of this Statute, without preparing his defence, with-
</p>

</p>
<p>out taking any trouble, was entitled, if he did not choose to go to trial,
</p>
<p>to defer it to the following term. That was a most valuable pri-
</p>
<p>vilege ; and we are called upon to give a construction to an Act
</p>
<p>which took away that privilege ; and we are asked upon what terms,
</p>
<p>upon a fair interpretation of the Statute, he was deprived of that
</p>
<p>privilege which he before undoubtedly possessed. What has been
</p>
<p>given to him in lieu of it? What does the Act, which was passed
</p>
<p>with a view to amend the law, but in amending the law, is said
</p>
<p>to have operated as a penal Act, depriving him of those rights?
</p>
<p>The law said there is no sufficient reason for the continuance
</p>
<p>of the right to traverse in prox. , which is rather to be looked
</p>
<p>upon as an indulgence than as the exercise of a wholesome right ;
</p>
<p>the indulgence is taken away, but a new right is reserved. He
</p>
<p>is furnished by the Act with all necessary and useful means
</p>
<p>proper for his defence ; it therefore says : " in case such defendant
</p>
<p>" shall appear to such indictment, or information, by his clerk
</p>
<p>" or attorney in Court, it shall not be lawful for such defendant
</p>
<p>68*
</p>
<p>" to imparl to a following term ; but a rule requiring such de-
</p>
<p>" fendant to plead may forthwith be given, and a plea or de-
</p>
<p>" murrer to such indictment enforced, or judgment by default
</p>
<p>" entered thereon, in the same manner as might have been done
</p>
<p>V before the passing of this Act." He is deprived of the right to
</p>
<p>traverse in prox., but it was never intended to deprive him of
</p>
<p>making what defence he pleased. There is a certain time within
</p>
<p>which, whatever that defence may be, he is obliged to bring it.
</p>
<p>There are four days in which he is obliged to plead in, and it is
</p>
<p>insisted that we are to assume, that not only the time should be
</p>
<p>impaired and contracted, but that the Statute must mean four
</p>
<p>days to plead to the merits. The Statute has said no such thing ;
</p>
<p>if the Statute, in depriving a party of a benefit, intended further
</p>
<p>to curtail him, by compelling him to plead in bar, would it not so
</p>
<p>express it? If the words "in bar" had been used there would
</p>
<p>have been no question, but they have not used those words, and
</p>
<p>this being a forfeiture, and therefore it is said in the nature of a
</p>
<p>penal Statute, the Court is called upon to construe it so as to compel
</p>
<p>a party to plead in abatement in two days if he thought fit to do so.
</p>
<p>That construction would cut off two running days, and but two days
</p>
<p>would be left, whereas the Statute has given four days. Without
</p>
<p>going further, I think I have sufficiently explained my view. We
</p>
<p>are bound not to give the Statute a narrow construction, moreover
</p>
<p>as the officer made no restriction as to the nature of the plea. If
</p>
<p>the case turned on that alone, I would not permit a party to be
</p>
<p>misled by the act of the officer of the Court ; and assuming that
</p>
<p>there has been a mistake, I would hold the party accused enti-
</p>
<p>tled to the benefit of it. These are my views upon it, and I believe
</p>
<p>I have the concurrence of the Court.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Burton.  I concur in the judgment pronounced
</p>
<p>by my Lord Chief Justice, and in the grounds upon which that
</p>
<p>judgment was founded. I conceive that this is a mere question of
</p>
<p>time upon the distinction between a plea in abatement and a plea in
</p>
<p>bar. That question is whether the traversers may now put in a

</p>
<p>plea in abatement, or whether they have lost that right by lapse of
</p>
<p>a day. Now, supposing I had more doubt than I have on the con-
</p>
<p>struction of the Statute, yet I should think a case of this kind open
</p>
<p>for the examination of the question whether any unfair delay was
</p>
<p>intended, whether what was done was with a view to gain time, or
</p>
<p>whether it was done fairly for the purpose of a defence, which the
</p>
<p>traversers considered they had a right to make, and if the lapse
</p>
<p>of time appeared to be in consequence of an inadvertence, I
</p>
<p>should be disposed to let the party make his defence by a plea in
</p>
<p>abatement, notwithstanding that inadvertence. However, it would
</p>
<p>not be right, after the judgment given by my Lord Chief Jus-
</p>
<p>tice to abstain from stating my opinion as to the construction of
</p>
<p>the Statute. I rely entirely on the words of the Statute itself. That
</p>
<p>has been my view from the time the discussion commenced, and I
</p>
<p>still think it the safest course to see what the words of the Statute
</p>
<p>are, and to follow the general rule in the construction of all Statutes,
</p>
<p>69*
</p>
<p>that when plain words are used, they should be construed according
</p>
<p>to their actual import. That is the course to be adopted iu the first
</p>
<p>instance. There may be cases in which a question may arise, and
</p>
<p>in which the observations so strongly made at the bar may apply,
</p>
<p>as to what may have been the intention of the Legislature, but the
</p>
<p>Court must be sure, and very clear indeed, as to that intention, be-
</p>
<p>fore it is at liberty to strain the words, or to carry the provisions of
</p>
<p>a Statute to a length to which the words of it do not extend. An-
</p>
<p>tecedent to this Statute, the traversers in cases of misdemeanor had
</p>
<p>an advantage, of which they had availed themselves for a length of
</p>
<p>time, that of traversing in prox. The Statute was passed to deprive
</p>
<p>the traversers of that advantage. It was right and just and reason-
</p>
<p>able that it should be put an end to. But then the question arises,
</p>
<p>how far the Statute has restrained the liberty of the subject in this
</p>
<p>respect, and we must see what the plain words of the Statute are.
</p>
<p>Now, the words of the Statute taken by themselves are quite clear ;
</p>
<p>instead of having a right to imparl, it fixes a precise time within
</p>
<p>which the party accused is to defend himself, that is four days.
</p>
<p>That is certainly a short time, but it cannot be suggested, and it has
</p>
<p>not been suggested, that the Legislature intended to make an ex-
</p>
<p>plicit difference between a defence in chief, and a plea in abate-
</p>
<p>ment. I have observed that in a criminal prosecution, a defence by
</p>
<p>way of abatement is often not merely dilatory, and, therefore,
</p>
<p>though the right of imparling to a certain time was taken away, it is
</p>
<p>likely the Legislature meant to give the party four days from the
</p>
<p>time mentioned in the Statute to plead and make his defence in
</p>
<p>whatever way he might choose. I do not think that the Legislature
</p>
<p>meant to make the distinction which has been contended for. I
</p>
<p>therefore conceive that this is the rational construction of the Sta-
</p>
<p>tute, and that I am bound to concur in opinion with my Lord Chief
</p>
<p>Justice. There is one circumstance upon which great stress has
</p>
<p>been laid, that is the notification to the Clerk of the Crown, and
</p>
<p>his answer to it. With respect to it, I think it was a general appli-
</p>
<p>cation as to what time the party had to plead, without any commu-

</p>
<p>nication as to the nature of the plea. That might have been owing
</p>
<p>to the difference not having occurred to the minds of the persons
</p>
<p>who made the application. The Clerk of the Crown seems to have
</p>
<p>been of the same opinion himself, that no distinction was to be
</p>
<p>made between pleas in bar and pleas in abatement. There seems
</p>
<p>to have been a misconception on both sides. On the construction
</p>
<p>of the Statute I am strongly of opinion that we ought not to deprive
</p>
<p>the parties of the right to pleas in abatement.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  I concur in the judgment of the
</p>
<p>Court, and feel it is unnecessary for me to state my reasons at
</p>
<p>length. But I wish to be clearly understood, as founding my
</p>
<p>judgment exclusively upon the construction of the Statute, and
</p>
<p>for this reason, that if a party be led into a mistake by mis-
</p>
<p>information from an officer of the Court, the Attorney- General
</p>
<p>not being a party to such misinformation, I am by no means
</p>
<p>satisfied (and indeed the tendency of my mind is the other
</p>
<p>way), that the right of the Crown can be thereby affected. If
</p>
<p>70*
</p>
<p>a party has been misled, and takes a step which he otherwise would
</p>
<p>not have taken, it may be in the discretion of the Court, upon a
</p>
<p>proper application, and an affidavit stating the grounds to let that
</p>
<p>party in to plead, whose time has lapsed ; but this is not an applica-
</p>
<p>tion to the discretion of the Court at all ; the learned counsel for
</p>
<p>the traversers have put it as a matter of right, and, I have
</p>
<p>heard nothing in answer to Mr. Moore's argument. With regard
</p>
<p>to the construction of the Statute, there appears a fixed time
</p>
<p>within which the traverser is to plead or demur, without distinction
</p>
<p>as to pleas in abatement, or pleas in chief. Into the merits of this
</p>
<p>plea I do not enter, but the party has a right to put in a dilatory
</p>
<p>plea, and provided he does so according to the rules of the Court,
</p>
<p>we have no power to take away that right from him ; for the period
</p>
<p>is fixed, within which he has to plead or demur. The Statute has
</p>
<p>taken away a solid privilege from the traverser, and has given him
</p>
<p>a privilege in return. The true construction is that adopted by my
</p>
<p>brother Burton, to construe the Act of Parliament according to the
</p>
<p>common and ordinary meaning of its language. When, therefore,
</p>
<p>the Legislature has said, that the party shall plead within four days,
</p>
<p>we must understand it to have meant to include every species of plea,
</p>
<p>which the law enables the party to put in. These pleas have been
</p>
<p>put in within four days, I therefore think they should be received.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin.  I concur in the judgment of the Court,
</p>
<p>and in the reasons so fully given by my Lord Chief Justice.
</p>
<p>The Attorney -General.  I understand the several pleas to be
</p>
<p>now received. I now hand in a demurrer to each of them ; and I
</p>
<p>submit that I am entitled to call on the traversers to join in demur-
</p>
<p>rer instanter ; Rex \. Layer, 16 State Trials, 122.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore and Mr. Figot, Q. C. contended that the traversers
</p>
<p>were entitled, according to the practice of the Crown side of the
</p>
<p>Court, to a four day rule to join in demurrer; Hex v. Johnson, 6
</p>
<p>East, 583 ; 1 Chit. Cr. Law, 432.

<p>The Attorney-General.  The ordinary practice may be so.
</p>
<p>But the recognizances are to appear from day to day, and I appre-

</p>
<p>hend I have a right to call the traversers on their recognizances, and
</p>
<p>to call on them to join in demurrer. I represent the Crown, and
</p>
<p>whatever may be the rules and practice of the Court, as has been
</p>
<p>well observed by Lord Plunket, they are the servants of the Court,
</p>
<p>and under its control, and I trust your Lordships, in the case of a
</p>
<p>plea in abatement, put in merely for delay, will call upon them to
</p>
<p>join in demurrer now.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore  That is the most extraordinary proposition which
</p>
<p>I have ever heard from counsel in any case. There is a settled
</p>
<p>practice by which the party is entitled to a certain privilege in
</p>
<p>order that he may consider whether he will join in demurrer or
</p>
<p>not ; yet the Attorney-General gravely asks your Lordships, to dis-
</p>
<p>regard that practice, and because he thinks fit to inform the Court
</p>
<p>that he has made up his mind as to the object of the plea, and that
</p>
<p>he has made up his mind to argue the demurrer, therefore all rules
</p>
<p>established for the benefit of the accused in the administration of
</p>
<p>ustice are to be set at nought. There may be an authority for it,
</p>
<p>71*
</p>
<p>but I confess I never heard such a proposition before, and I trust I
</p>
<p>may never hear it again.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General in reply still relied on the case of Rex
</p>
<p>v. Kir man.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chtef Justice.  There was no objection made on
</p>
<p>the part of the traversers in that case. I have inquired the practice
</p>
<p>from the officers of the Court, and 1 find that it is the practice to give
</p>
<p>the four day rule.
</p>
<p>MONDAY, November 20th.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown having stated that joinders in demurrer
</p>
<p>had been handed in by the agent for the several traversers,
</p>
<p>Mr. Ford, attorney for the traversers, submitted that he was en-
</p>
<p>titled to a further rule for time to prepare the paper books.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown stated that the traversers had a right
</p>
<p>to call on the Crown to join in the expense of paper books.
</p>
<p>The Attorney -General contended that there was no rule for
</p>
<p>joining in the expense of paper books, as they were ready to be de-
</p>
<p>livered to the Judges free of expense.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore was heard in reply.
</p>
<p>The Court held that as the paper books had been furnished to
</p>
<p>them free of expense, the traversers were bound to argue the
</p>
<p>demurrer immediately, and the following day was fixed for the
</p>
<p>argument.
</p>
<p>TUESDAY, November 21st.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General.  My Lords, the plea in this case is a
</p>
<p>plea in abatement, and the general nature of it is, that it states that
</p>
<p>the indictment was found a true bill on the evidence of four wit-
</p>
<p>nesses produced before and examined by the Grand Jury, and that
</p>
<p>those witnesses were not, nor was any one of them, previous to being
</p>
<p>examined, sworn in open Court, according to the provisions of the
</p>
<p>Statute 56 Geo. III. c. 87, and the point intended to be raised by
</p>
<p>this plea is, that the Statute 1 &c 2 Vict. cap. 37, an Act to empower
</p>
<p>the foreman of Grand Juries to administer oaths to witnesses on
</p>
<p>bills of indictment, does not extend to the Court of Queen's Bench,

</p>
<p>and that the witnesses to support this indictment should have been
</p>
<p>sworn in open Court according to the provisions of the 56 Geo. III.
</p>
<p>c. 87. The earliest occasion on which a construction was given to
</p>
<p>this Statute of 1 & 2 Vic. was in the year 1838, immediately after
</p>
<p>the passing of this Act, by the Judges (Woulfe, C. B., and Moore,
</p>
<p>J.) who then presided at the Commission Court for the county, and
</p>
<p>county of the city of Dublin ; on that occasion the Chief Baron
</p>
<p>charged the Jury with respect to this Act, and directed them to act
</p>
<p>according to its provisions, and at the following commission in 1 839,
</p>
<p>when Doherty, C. J., and Johnson, J., presided, a similar charge
</p>
<p>was given, and from that time to the present the same construction
</p>
<p>72*
</p>
<p>has been given to this Statute by the several Judges who succes-
</p>
<p>sively presided at the Commission Court. The principle governing
</p>
<p>the Commission Court would equally apply to this Court ; and if
</p>
<p>the Court of Queen's Bench is to be excluded, the Commission
</p>
<p>Court is also to be excluded. The Court is therefore called on to
</p>
<p>disregard the declared opinion of the twelve Judges, and to cast
</p>
<p>an imputation upon the convictions which have been found since
</p>
<p>the passing of this Act, and to admit that the sentences which
</p>
<p>have been pronounced were illegal, which would be the result of
</p>
<p>the proposition contended for on the other side.
</p>
<p>But I do not mean to rest my argument upon the opinion of
</p>
<p>the twelve Judges, although it has been uniformly acted on up to
</p>
<p>the present time; for I think I shall be able to show, that the Judges
</p>
<p>have come to a true construction of the Statute, and that any other
</p>
<p>construction would be contrary to its intention and its object.
</p>
<p>Before I advert particularly to the Acts in question, I shall call
</p>
<p>the attention of the Court to the law as it stands in England, which
</p>
<p>may be considered the common law, upon the subject. At the
</p>
<p>Durham Assizes of 1834, the practice appears to have been for
</p>
<p>the Grand Jury to swear the witnesses, Teazedale's Case, 2 Lew.
</p>
<p>C. C. 294, and in a late case, Regina v. Russell, Carr. & Marsh,
</p>
<p>247, the Court held that when the Grand Jury had found a bill,
</p>
<p>the Judges before whom the case came to be tried ought not to
</p>
<p>inquire whether the witnesses were properly sworn previously to
</p>
<p>their going before the Grand Jury, and that an improper mode of
</p>
<p>swearing them would not vitiate the indictment, as the Grand Jury
</p>
<p>were at liberty to find a bill on their own knowledge merely. In
</p>
<p>that case Wightman, J., referred to a case which had been tried
</p>
<p>before Lord Denman and himself (a report of which case I have
</p>
<p>obtained from Sir Gregory Lewin) ; on that occasion Sir Gregory
</p>
<p>Lewin contended, that the Grand Jury had no power to administer
</p>
<p>the oath to the witnesses, but Lord Denman and Mr. Justice
</p>
<p>Wightman held, that it was not competent for them to inquire into
</p>
<p>the information upon which the Grand Jury had found the bill. Such

</p>
<p>has been the practice in England, and I shall now show how the
</p>
<p>law stands in this country. Prior to the passing of 56 Geo. III.
</p>
<p>c. 87, it had been the custom for Grand Juries to find bills of in-
</p>
<p>dictment, not upon their own knowledge, but in a manner which
</p>
<p>the law did not recognize, namely upon sworn informations, with-
</p>
<p>out having examined the witnesses at all ; and the object of the
</p>
<p>56 Geo. III. was to alter that practice. It recites that this practice
</p>
<p>existed and should be discontinued, and then declares and enacts,
</p>
<p>that no bill of indictment shall be returned a true bill by any Grand
</p>
<p>Jury in Ireland, unless the same hath been found by the Jurors
</p>
<p>upon the evidence of one or more witnesses for the Crown, sworn
</p>
<p>in Court, and produced before them. That is a declaratory Act ;
</p>
<p>but I shall not now contend how far being a declaratory Act, it
</p>
<p>affects the cases to which I have referred, as showing what the com-
</p>
<p>mon law was, because it is not material to go into that question ;
</p>
<p>and I am willing for the purposes of this argument to admit, that
</p>
<p>under the 56 Geo. III., one or more of the witnesses should be
</p>
<p>73*
</p>
<p>sworn in open Court. The object of that Act was, not with respect
</p>
<p>to the place of swearing the witnesses, but to do away with the
</p>
<p>practice of finding bills upon sworn informations, without a viva
</p>
<p>voce examination of the witnesses. Under this Statute the practice
</p>
<p>arose of swearing the witnesses in open Court, and it is not ques-
</p>
<p>tioned, but on the contrary it is admitted by the plea, that this was
</p>
<p>a general provision of the Statute extending to every Grand Jury
</p>
<p>in Ireland, inclusive of the Queen's Bench. This Statute then,
</p>
<p>which extended to every part of Ireland, which was general in its
</p>
<p>terms, not excluding any Court, led to this inconvenience  that
</p>
<p>the proceedings of the Court were interrupted, and that there
</p>
<p>was an irreverent administration of the oath, in the confusion and
</p>
<p>noise of the Court. That was a mischief which was felt to exist in
</p>
<p>every Court of Oyer and Terminer, and in none more so, perhaps,
</p>
<p>than in the Queen's Bench, and the object of the 1 &. 2 Vict, was to
</p>
<p>meet that mischief; but still carrying out the principles of the 56 Geo.
</p>
<p>III., namely, to have a viva voce examination of witnesses. The 1 8c
</p>
<p>2 Vic. is entitled " An Act to empower the Foreman, or any other
</p>
<p>" member of Grand Juries in Ireland, to administer oaths to
</p>
<p>" witnesses on bills of indictment." Although no great stress
</p>
<p>is to be laid on the title of an Act, yet it has not been thrown
</p>
<p>out of consideration in all cases. The title of this Act is in
</p>
<p>conformity with its provisions, and shows that it did not seek
</p>
<p>to confine it to any particular class of Courts. The preamble
</p>
<p>recites the 56 Geo. III., and that the provision therein con-
</p>
<p>tained for the viva voce examination of witnesses had been
</p>
<p>found most salutary, but that the administration of the oath in
</p>
<p>Court had been productive of delay, and other inconvenience. Now
</p>
<p>there is nothing in that recital to confine it to any particular Court,
</p>
<p>it recites a general mischief applicable to all Grand Juries in every
</p>
<p>Court, that was the swearing the witnesses in open Court, therefore
</p>
<p>we have on the face of the preamble of the Act, that portion to
</p>
<p>which I am entitled to look, the clear intention of the Legislature
</p>
<p>to provide a remedy for an existing mischief applicable to every

</p>
<p>Grand Jury. The Act then says, " for remedy whereof," that is,
</p>
<p>for remedy of the mischief arising from the swearing of witnesses in
</p>
<p>open Court, "be it enacted, that in all cases where bills of indict-
</p>
<p>" ment are to be laid before Grand Juries in Ireland for their consi-
</p>
<p>" deration ;" that provision cannot be said to exclude the Court of
</p>
<p>Queen's Bench; " the Clerk of the Crown at the Assizes, and the
</p>
<p>" Clerk of the Peace at Quarter Sessions, or his or their deputy,
</p>
<p>" shall endorse upon the back of each bill of indictment, the name
</p>
<p>" or names of the witnesses for the Crown in support of such bill,
</p>
<p>" and shall send the same so endorsed, to the Grand Jury, and the
</p>
<p>" foreman or other member of the Grand Jury so empannelled
</p>
<p>" shall, previous to the examination of any witnessess whose name
</p>
<p>. shall appear endorsed, Sec, administer the oath, &c." And it then
</p>
<p>contains the following provisoes : " that the said oath is not to be in
</p>
<p>" addition to, but in lieu of that heretofore administered by the 56
</p>
<p>" Geo. III., and that no foreman of any Grand Jury shall have
</p>
<p>L*
</p>
<p>74*
</p>
<p>" power to administer such oath to any witness whose name shall
</p>
<p>" not have been previously endorsed on such bill of indictment by
</p>
<p>" the Clerk of the Crown or Clerk of the Peace respectively." Now
</p>
<p>looking to the provisions and preamble of this Act, and looking to
</p>
<p>the fact, that the 56 Geo. III. applies to all Grand Juries in Ireland,
</p>
<p>is it not the plain object of the Legislature to leave that which was
</p>
<p>beneficial, namely, the viva voce examination of witnesses, un-
</p>
<p>touched, and to apply a remedy to that which did not work well,
</p>
<p>namely, the administration of an oath in open Court, and because
</p>
<p>the Act has named the Clerk of the Crown at Assizes, and the
</p>
<p>Clerk of the Peace at Sessions, as the ministerial officers to perform
</p>
<p>this duty, you are called on to give this narrow construction to the
</p>
<p>Act, and to control the intention of the Legislature, and to decide
</p>
<p>contrary to what has been received by all the Judges in Ireland, as
</p>
<p>the true construction of the Act. There are abundant authorities
</p>
<p>to show that where a ministerial duty is imposed on a ministerial
</p>
<p>officer, by an Act of Parliament, that duty may in similar cases be
</p>
<p>performed by another officer similarly situated, in Courts to which
</p>
<p>the Act is intended to extend.
</p>
<p>As to the general rules of construction of Acts of Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment, there is no doubt that a remedial Statute should receive
</p>
<p>a liberal construction, so as to extend the remedy and to sup-
</p>
<p>press the mischief, Murphy v. Leader, Jebb & B. 75 ; Watt
</p>
<p>v. Matin, 4 Scott, N. H. 362; Rex v.Inhab. of Everdon, 9 East,
</p>
<p>105 ; in the matter of Bryant, 5 T. R. 509; New River Com-
</p>
<p>pany v. Graves, 2 Vern. 431. The general principle is clear,
</p>
<p>that even if necessary, the Court will put a liberal construction
</p>
<p>upon a remedial Act, contrary to the literal words, to carry out
</p>
<p>the intention of the Legislature ; but it is not necessary for me to
</p>
<p>contend so in the present case, 2 Inst. 395 ; in that case, although
</p>
<p>an elegit was directed to one particular officer, and the words of the
</p>
<p>Statute named another, yet the Court held, that this being a benefi-
</p>
<p>cial law, by equity it was extended to every other immediate officer,
</p>
<p>to every other Court of Record, and in p. 393, in commenting on the

<p>Statute of Westminster 2, Lord Coke says, that although justices in
</p>
<p>eyre are there mentioned, yet that Act being a beneficial law, it is to be
</p>
<p>taken by equity to extend to the Court of Common Pleas ; and in
</p>
<p>p. 431 , the same doctrine is laid down, and in commenting on the Sta-
</p>
<p>tute of Westminster 1, he states, " that Statute being made in affir-
</p>
<p>" mance of common right, doth extend to the Court of Chancery,
</p>
<p>" Court of Exchequer, and to all other Courts of Justice, for that all
</p>
<p>" are within the same mischief, and, therefore, ought to be within the
</p>
<p>" same remedy." If then this case is to be governed by those rules of
</p>
<p>construction, if the intention of the Legislature is beyond doubt, and
</p>
<p>the 56 Geo. III. and the general nature of the enactment, and both
</p>
<p>provisoes, and the general provisions applicable to all Grand Juries,
</p>
<p>be kept in mind, is the Court prepared to say, that this is inappli-
</p>
<p>cable to Grand Juries in this Court, and also to the Court of Com-
</p>
<p>mission at Green-street, and also to special Commission? Those
</p>
<p>Courts are as much excluded from the operation of this Act, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to the argument on the other side, as the Court of Queen's
</p>
<p>75*
</p>
<p>Bench would be, yet it has been the practice since the passing of
</p>
<p>this Act, at Special Commissions, to have the witnesses sworn be-
</p>
<p>fore the Grand Jury, and, therefore, if the Court will follow this tech-
</p>
<p>nical construction, they will thereby be deciding, that all the convic-
</p>
<p>tions at those Assizes have been illegal. If it be held, that the Act
</p>
<p>only applies to Quarter Sessions and Assizes, the proceedings by the
</p>
<p>Recorder of Cork must also be held to be illegal, as he holds his
</p>
<p>Sessions every six weeks, and also those of the Recorder of Dublin
</p>
<p>who does not hold Quarter Sessions. [Mr. Justice Perrin.  He holds
</p>
<p>Quarter Sessions, but adjourns them from time to time.] If so, he
</p>
<p>comes within the terms of the Act, and yet is it to be said, that when
</p>
<p>he adjourns in order that the Judges may preside at the Commission
</p>
<p>of Oyer and Terminer, the proceedings in the same Court, within a
</p>
<p>day of each other, and for the same purpose, are to be different ?
</p>
<p>Even if the Court was called on to give the strictest construction to
</p>
<p>this Act, it is a mistake to say those Courts are not Courts of Assize.
</p>
<p>Before adverting to this part of the case, I would remark, that if an
</p>
<p>indictment was found in any part of Ireland, under the provisions of
</p>
<p>the 1 & 2 Vict, it might be returned by certiorari into this Court,
</p>
<p>and then the accused might be tried at the bar of this Court, and
</p>
<p>are the proceedings to be different in such a case as this ? With
</p>
<p>regard to the jurisdiction of the Court of Queen's Bench as a Court
</p>
<p>of Assize, it is laid down in Dagge's Crim. Law, 175: " that the
</p>
<p>"jurisdiction of this Court is very extensive. The Justices of the
</p>
<p>" King's Bench are sovereign Justices of Oyer and Terminer, gaol
</p>
<p>" delivery, and of eyre, and their jurisdiction is general all over
</p>
<p>" England ;" and in 1 Bac. Abr. Assize, A. p. 332, it is laid down
</p>
<p>that assizes are to be taken in the King's Bench, or Common
</p>
<p>Pleas, for the county in which they sit, and for all others, are to
</p>
<p>be arraigned in their proper counties. In Comyn. Dig. Assize,
</p>
<p>B. 21, it is said, that these Courts have an original jurisdiction
</p>
<p>for taking assizes without any patent or commission, that is, they
</p>
<p>had that inherent jurisdiction at the common law. If then those
</p>
<p>words are to be considered in their literal sense, this Court is a

</p>
<p>Court of Assize, and in that view of the Act, the Clerk of the
</p>
<p>Crown has jurisdiction to act as a ministerial officer, as a Clerk of
</p>
<p>the Crown at assizes. Formerly this Court followed the King's
</p>
<p>person ; and instances have occurred, in which this Court has re-
</p>
<p>moved its sittings to a distance from where it was usually held, the
</p>
<p>effect of which was, that the proceedings of other Courts, both
</p>
<p>civil and criminal, in the county into which it was removed, were
</p>
<p>thereby suspended. Before the year 1729, treasons and felonies
</p>
<p>committed in the county, and the county of the city of Dublin,
</p>
<p>could only be tried at the bar of the Court of King's Bench during
</p>
<p>term ; and it became necessary, in consequence, to pass an Act to
</p>
<p>allow the commission to continue its sittings after term, 2 Gabb.
</p>
<p>Crim. Law, 13. Upon these grounds there is no pretence for
</p>
<p>saying, that the Judges have come to a wrong construction of this
</p>
<p>Statute.
</p>
<p>With respect to the form of the pleas, they have been most
</p>
<p>76*
</p>
<p>inartificially drawn. The plea states, that four witnesses were
</p>
<p>examined before the Grand Jury, without stating the names of
</p>
<p>those witnesses, or that the names were unknown. The rule is
</p>
<p>this, that if the parties did not know the names, their course was
</p>
<p>to aver, that those persons were unknown, but they were not
</p>
<p>at liberty to put in a more general statement ; that divers per-
</p>
<p>sons did a certain act, without setting forth their names, or stat-
</p>
<p>ing that they were unknown, which statement they should have
</p>
<p>verified on their oaths. Steph. PL 353 ; 2 Gabb. Crim. Law, 221.
</p>
<p>Another principle is, that in a plea in abatement, certainty in every
</p>
<p>particular is requisite ; now this bill of indictment might have been
</p>
<p>found on the testimony of witnesses who had been affirmed, not
</p>
<p>sworn, and in this respect their plea is not sufficiently certain.
</p>
<p>Sir Colman O Loyhlen.  My Lords, with regard to the prac-
</p>
<p>tice which has been relied on as governing this case, namely, the
</p>
<p>practice of considering this Act as applicable to all Courts, it ought
</p>
<p>not to have any weight. The question now to be decided is matter of
</p>
<p>strict law, and practice ought not to be a guide in such a case. Rex v.
</p>
<p>Inhabitants of Eriswell, 3 T. P. 725. In that case Lord Kenyon
</p>
<p>said : that he hoped he should never have the rule communis
</p>
<p>error facit jus insisted upon in a question of law, as to act upon
</p>
<p>such a rule in such a question, was to set up " a misconception of
</p>
<p>the law in destruction of the law," and that for his part, " he was
</p>
<p>" clear it would be most dangerous to adopt it, as according to that
</p>
<p>" doctrine, the mistakes of Judges, provided they became uni-
</p>
<p>" versal, would become the rules of law." Cases had been cited
</p>
<p>from Lew. C. C, in order to shew, that by the common law in
</p>
<p>England, witnesses were sworn before the Grand Jury; but even
</p>
<p>supposing such to be the case in England, no such law could pre-
</p>
<p>vail in this country, there being a specific Statute upon the subject.
</p>
<p>It was also said, that when the Grand Jury had found the bill, the
</p>
<p>Court ought not to inquire whether the witnesses were properly
</p>
<p>sworn, Bex v. Russell, 1 C. & March, 247; but there are several
</p>
<p>cases in which the contrary has been decided. In an Anonymous

</p>
<p>Case, 2 Lew. 322, it was found, after the Grand Jury had been
</p>
<p>discharged, that the witnessess on one of the bills, which had
</p>
<p>been delivered into Court as found, had not been sworn, and
</p>
<p>Alderson, B., sent for the Grand Jury, and desired them to take
</p>
<p>back the bill and examine the witnesses afresh ; and in Rex v.
</p>
<p>Dickenson, Puss. & Ry. 401, it is laid down, that if witnesses go
</p>
<p>before the Grand Jury without being sworn, and the bill is found,
</p>
<p>and the prisoner tried and convicted, it is proper to recommend
</p>
<p>him for a free pardon. But the witnesses should not only be
</p>
<p>sworn, but properly sworn, and in a case in 6 C. & P. 90, it is said,
</p>
<p>that a party cannot be legally convicted upon an indictment found by
</p>
<p>the Grand Jury, upon the testimony of witnesses who were sworn
</p>
<p>by an officer of the Court after the session had elapsed, and so much
</p>
<p>importance was attached to that case, that a special commission had
</p>
<p>to issue to try the prisoner again, who had been convicted. It must
</p>
<p>be admitted then, from those cases, that every bill of indictment
</p>
<p>should be found upon the evidence of witnesses properly sworn ;
</p>
<p>77*
</p>
<p>and the question now is, have the witnesses been properly sworn
</p>
<p>in the present instance? From the Statute 56 Geo. III. (which is
</p>
<p>declaratory of the common law), it is clear, that in order to be pro-
</p>
<p>perly sworn, they should have been sworn in open Court, unless
</p>
<p>that Statute has been repealed by a subsequent Statute. It is ad-
</p>
<p>mitted here, that they were not sworn in open Court, but it is said
</p>
<p>that the Statute 56 Geo. III. has been repealed by 1, 2 Vic. That
</p>
<p>Act, however, upon its proper construction, only applies to Assizes
</p>
<p>and Quarter Sessions.
</p>
<p>The first question which arises upon the Act is, can the word
</p>
<p>" Assize" include the Court of Queen's Bench? The word "As-
</p>
<p>size" cannot include the Court of Queen's Bench, 3 Blac Com.
</p>
<p>18/5; 2 Gab. Crim. Law, 8 ; 1 Reeve's Hist. pp. 178,245. At com-
</p>
<p>mon law Assizes were taken in the Common Pleas and Queen's
</p>
<p>Bench, but Magna Charta has altered this, and the Justices were di-
</p>
<p>rected to take the Assize in each county, and a further alteration
</p>
<p>was made by the 3 Edw. IV. c. 5, Ir. Whatever, may have been the
</p>
<p>original meaning of the word " Assize," it has now acquired a pe-
</p>
<p>culiar meaning by practice, and it is to this specific meaning it is to
</p>
<p>be applied. In Smith v. Harrison, 6 Mod, 143, it is said, " when
</p>
<p>" an Act of Parliament makes use of a term generally, it shall re-
</p>
<p>" ceive the same sense that the common law takes it in, and no
</p>
<p>" other;" and the same is laid down in 2 Inst. 736; and in Dwar.
</p>
<p>on Stat. 702, it is said words are to be taken in their ordinary sig-
</p>
<p>nification. See then what has been the ordinary sense in which
</p>
<p>this word has been used ? The Queen's Bench is not at common
</p>
<p>law (meaning by common law the signification put upon the word
</p>
<p>" Assizes" of text writers), a Court of Assizes, nor is it one in sta-
</p>
<p>tute language. A series of statutable enactments shows that the
</p>
<p>word " Assizes" in a Statute does not extend to the Court of
</p>
<p>Queen's Bench. The Acts allowing presentments to be made for
</p>
<p>malicious burnings; 7 Will. III. c. 21, 9 Will. III. c. 9; in conse-
</p>
<p>quence of the use of the word " Assizes," were held not to extend
</p>
<p>to the Queen's Bench, and it was found necessary to pass the 29

</p>
<p>Geo. II. c. 14, to extend them to that Court ; In re Millar, 2 Jebb
</p>
<p>& Sy. 273. There are other Acts also, in which this distinction
</p>
<p>has been taken ; the 60 Geo. III. c. 4, takes a clear distinction be-
</p>
<p>tween the Queen's Bench and the Court of Assize, and a similar
</p>
<p>distinction is taken by the Grand Jury Act, 6, 7 Will. IV. c. 116;
</p>
<p>there the Legislature thought it necessary (s. 3) to enact, that for
</p>
<p>the purposes of that Act, the word " Assizes" should include and
</p>
<p>import "a presenting term," and the words "Judge of Assize"
</p>
<p>should include Judges of the Queen's Bench. The same distinction
</p>
<p>is taken by the 5, 6 Will. IV. c. 26, and several other Acts ; and
</p>
<p>there is a distinction drawn between Clerks of the Crown in the
</p>
<p>Queen's Bench, and Clerks of the Crown at Assizes, 2 Will. IV.
</p>
<p>c. 48. It is clear from these authorities, that neither at common
</p>
<p>law, nor by Statute, could the word "Assizes" be taken to mean
</p>
<p>the Queen's Bench; and the last Statute referred to shows that the
</p>
<p>Clerk of the Crown at the Assizes did not include the Clerk of the
</p>
<p>Crown in the Queen's Bench.
</p>
<p>78*
</p>
<p>The next question then is, whether the 1 & 2 Vict, applies to
</p>
<p>Grand Juries in this Court. It is said that it does apply to this
</p>
<p>Court, first, because the words are general, and secondly, because
</p>
<p>such is the policy of the Act. Tn the first place, however, it must
</p>
<p>be remarked, this is a penal Act, and should receive a strict con-
</p>
<p>struction, for not only does it deprive the accused of the means
</p>
<p>of knowing the names of his accusers, but it also takes away from
</p>
<p>him that right which he was entitled to at common law, and creates
</p>
<p>a new jurisdiction ; Pierce v. Hopper, 1 Strange, 249 ; Pool v.
</p>
<p>Neil, 2 Sid. 63. There was another reason why it should not be
</p>
<p>held to apply to the Queen's Bench, it was a mere enacting Statute,
</p>
<p>and the Queen's Bench is not to be included in it unless expressly
</p>
<p>named, 2 Hawk. 426 ; Rex v. Richards, 8 B. k C. 420 ; Rex v.
</p>
<p>Kelsey, 1 D. P. C. 481. It is true, the 56 Geo. III. includes the
</p>
<p>Queen's Bench, but that is a declaratory as well as an enacting Sta-
</p>
<p>tute, and, therefore, the Queen's Bench was included in it, because
</p>
<p>it is included in all declaratory, though not in enacting Statutes.
</p>
<p>There is nothing in the Statute of Vict, to take it out of this general
</p>
<p>rule. It is said that the title of the Act is general, but it is well
</p>
<p>settled that the title is no part of the Act, Rex v. Williams, 1 Wm.
</p>
<p>Bl. 95 ; Mills v. Wilkins, 6 Mod. 62 ; Dwar. on Stat. 653 ; but
</p>
<p>even admitting the title to be part of the Statute, there is nothing in
</p>
<p>the title to contradict the construction we seek to put upon it,
</p>
<p>namely, that it does not extend to presenting terms. The title to
</p>
<p>other Grand Jury Acts was equally general as this. Thus, the
</p>
<p>3 & 4 Will. IV. c. 78, is entitled, " An Act to amend the laws re-
</p>
<p>lating to Grand Juries in Ireland,'''' yet that Statute had only re-
</p>
<p>lation to Grand Juries at Assizes and Quarter Sessions, and the 6 k7
</p>
<p>Will. IV. c. 116, is equally general in its title, yet it was necessary
</p>
<p>to pass a subsequent Act, 7 Will. IV. c. 2, to extend its provisions
</p>
<p>to the Queen's Bench. When Acts are in pari materia, if the
</p>
<p>same words are used in both Statutes, a distinction made in the one
</p>
<p>is a legislative exposition of the sense in which it should be taken
</p>
<p>in the other ; Gale v. Laurie, 5 B. k C. 163 ; Rex v. Smith, 4 T.

<p>R. 419. But it is said the words in the enacting part are general ;
</p>
<p>they are controlled by the subsequent words ; Petty v. Goddard,
</p>
<p>O. Bridg. 40 ; Dwar. Stat. 688. It is true, the Statute uses those gene-
</p>
<p>ral words, but it afterwards specifies expressly the modus operandi
</p>
<p>at the Assizes and at Sessions, but it says nothing as to the modus
</p>
<p>operandi in the Queen's Bench, and this amounts to a clear decla-
</p>
<p>ration by the Legislature, that they never intended it should extend
</p>
<p>to the Queen's Bench. The words of the Statute it is true, are " in
</p>
<p>all cases when bills of indictment, &c," but those words, "in all
</p>
<p>cases," must mean " in all cases of crimes committed, i.e. treasons,
</p>
<p>felonies, and misdemeanors," not as contended for on the other side,
</p>
<p>in all cases before all Grand Juries ; and the Statute should be read
</p>
<p>as if it included negative words, confining the modus 0])erandi to
</p>
<p>the Clerks of the Crown and Clerks of the Peace. But it is said that
</p>
<p>the Statute is only directory ; it is, however, settled that if an affir-
</p>
<p>mative Statute, which is introductory of a new law, directs a thing
</p>
<p>79*
</p>
<p>to be done in a certain manner, so that even in the absence from the
</p>
<p>Statute of any negative words, it shall not, and cannot be done in
</p>
<p>any other manner ; Wethin v. Baldwin, 1 Sid. 55; Plowd. Com. 206.
</p>
<p>Affirmative words, if absolute and peremptory, will make the Sta-
</p>
<p>tute as imperative as if the case were put in the negative. Suppose
</p>
<p>an indictment for perjury against one of the witnesses, who had
</p>
<p>been examined before the Grand Jury. This indictment should
</p>
<p>contain the averment that the names were endorsed by the Clerk of
</p>
<p>the Crown, and that fact must also be proved, otherwise a convic-
</p>
<p>tion could not be had, Rex v. Hie/gins, 2 East, 21. It must further
</p>
<p>appear and be alleged in the indictment, that the person by whom
</p>
<p>the oath was administered had competent power to administer it,
</p>
<p>now the foreman had only power to administer an oath to a wit-
</p>
<p>ness, whose name was endorsed, and that endorsement should be
</p>
<p>made by the proper officer in pursuance of the Act. Hex \. J food,
</p>
<p>2 Rus. on Crimes, 632; Reginci \. Rawlins, 8 C. & P. 439, these
</p>
<p>cases show that the reference in the Act to the Clerk of the Crown
</p>
<p>at the Assizes, is imperative and not merely directory, and if impera-
</p>
<p>tive they must control the former words of the Act. But it is said,
</p>
<p>that the Statute is to be construed by the preamble, it is, however,
</p>
<p>settled that the preamble is no part of the Statute, Mills v. JFilkins, 6
</p>
<p>Mod. 62, and it often happens that the preambles of Statutes, where
</p>
<p>they recited the mischief for which a remedy was intended, were
</p>
<p>more extensive than the enacting part of the Statute, Rex v. Powell,
</p>
<p>4 T. Pi. 576. But even supposing the question to be, whether this
</p>
<p>particular case was within the mischief which it was the object of
</p>
<p>the Statute to remedy, yet it could not have been intended to refer
</p>
<p>to the term Grand Jury. In this Court prosecutions seldom occur,
</p>
<p>and therefore the mischief is small, but at Assizes and Quarter
</p>
<p>Sessions it is a matter of every day occurrence, and that was what
</p>
<p>the Legislature had in contemplation to remedy. It is a maxim of
</p>
<p>law, which it is not possible to controvert, that if the words of a
</p>
<p>Statute do not reach to an inconvenience rarely happening, they
</p>
<p>ought not to be extended to it by an equitable construction, for

</p>
<p>the objects of a remedial Statute are mischiefs quai frequenter ac-
</p>
<p>cidunt. But no matter what might be the mischief contemplated
</p>
<p>by this Act, the Court are bound to inquire what wast the remedy
</p>
<p>provided, and that is to be collected from the Act itself, the meaning
</p>
<p>of which is to be sought not from the title, nor from the preamble,
</p>
<p>but from the purview and body of the Act ; for however general the
</p>
<p>preamble may be, yet if the words of the Act are not equally general,
</p>
<p>the Court is bound to give effect to the latter and not to the former,
</p>
<p>for it is in the latter that the intention of the Legislature is most
</p>
<p>clearly stated and most unequivocally defined. Now the words of
</p>
<p>the Statute are: " in all cases where bills of indictment are to be
</p>
<p>" laid before Grand Juries in Ireland for their consideration, the
</p>
<p>" Clerk of the Crown at the Assizes, and the Clerk of the Peace at
</p>
<p>" Quarter Sessions shall endorse, &c, and the foreman of the
</p>
<p>" Grand Jury so empannelled," &c. ; now the words "foreman
</p>
<p>of the Grand Jury" can only mean the foreman of the Grand
</p>
<p>80*
</p>
<p>Jury at Assizes or Quarter Sessions ; the words M so empannelled"
</p>
<p>strengthen that conclusion, so does the concluding proviso, " that no
</p>
<p>" foreman of any Grand Jury shall have power, &c, unless the name
</p>
<p>" shall have heen previously endorsed by the Clerk of the Crown
</p>
<p>" or Clerk of the Peace respectively." Now the word "respectively"
</p>
<p>must have been used with a view to restrict the application of the
</p>
<p>Act to the two Courts previously alluded to. A Statute ought to be
</p>
<p>construed, so that no clause or sentence should appear superfluous,
</p>
<p>and the latest intention of the Legislature should be followed by
</p>
<p>qualifying the prior general words by the subsequent particular
</p>
<p>ones, and if you exclude these words as surplusage, you will ex-
</p>
<p>clude sensible and operative words. But it is said that if this case
</p>
<p>is not within the literal words it is clearly within the equity of the
</p>
<p>Statute ; it is, however, a dangerous course to strain an Act of Par-
</p>
<p>liament in order to give it an equitable construction. In Bradling
</p>
<p>v. Harrington, 6 B. & C. 475, Lord Tenterden says: "I cannot
</p>
<p>" forbear observing, that I think there is always danger in giving
</p>
<p>" effect to what is called the equity of a Statute, and that it is
</p>
<p>" much safer and better to rely on and abide by the plain words,
</p>
<p>" although the Legislature might possibly have provided for other
</p>
<p>" cases had their attention been directed to them;" and in Bex v.
</p>
<p>Inhabitants of Beat ty, 10 B. & C. 526, the same Judge thus ex-
</p>
<p>presses himself : " We think it much the safer course to adhere to
</p>
<p>" the words of the Statute construed in their ordinary import, than
</p>
<p>" to enter into any inquiry as to the supposed intention of the
</p>
<p>" persons who framed it." In Motley v. Bush, 3 B. &. C. 164,
</p>
<p>he expresses himself to the same effect. If there has been a casus
</p>
<p>omissus in the Act, it is the duty of the Legislature not of the
</p>
<p>Court to supply it, Jones v. Smart, 1 T. R. 52. As to the conse-
</p>
<p>quences that would arise from thus considering that Statute, the
</p>
<p>Court are not to take this into their consideration ; they should con-
</p>
<p>strue the law as they find it. As to the objections to the form of
</p>
<p>the plea, it is said we should have set forth the names of the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses, or state that they were unknown, and Steph. PI. 302-3, has

<p>been referred to, but the cases referred to do not support that posi-
</p>
<p>tion, and when facts are in the knowledge of the opposite party less
</p>
<p>particularity*^ required in pleading, Steph. PI. 370. As to the omis-
</p>
<p>sion of the word " affirmed" it is included in the word " sworn."
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore.  My Lords, whatever was the law of England upon
</p>
<p>this subject, it is plain, that after the passing of the 56 Geo. III. no
</p>
<p>bill of indictment could be found unless the witnesses were pre-
</p>
<p>viously sworn in open Court. The language of that Act is express
</p>
<p>and peremptory, and it is impossible to contend, that if the 1 & 2
</p>
<p>Vict, had not passed, such an indictment as the present could be
</p>
<p>sustained. The first question, then is, whether 56 Geo. III. has
</p>
<p>been repealed in all or any portion of it by the subsequent enact-
</p>
<p>ments. It has not been repealed, and according to the law as it
</p>
<p>stands, there is no legal objection to the swearing of witnesses in
</p>
<p>open court before the bill has been sent to the Grand Jury. The
</p>
<p>Act of Vict, has only substituted another mode of swearing wit-
</p>
<p>81*
</p>
<p>nesses, but it has not repealed, nor does it profess to repeal the 56
</p>
<p>Geo. III. That Act is recited in the Act of Vict., and if it was
</p>
<p>the intention of the Legislature to repeal any portion of it, it was
</p>
<p>easy to have said so, but there is no word in the Statute of Vict.,
</p>
<p>which expresses such an intention, and one of the provisoes de-
</p>
<p>monstrates this, namely : " that said oath is not to be in addition
</p>
<p>to, but in lieu of, that heretofore administered." If the Legis-
</p>
<p>lature intended to repeal the former Statute why use those words ?
</p>
<p>They say, we do not repeal the former Act, we merely substitute
</p>
<p>another mode of proceeding, and provide that the oath to be ad-
</p>
<p>ministered by this Act is to be in lieu of that which was formerly
</p>
<p>administered, therefore, if this Act does not apply there- can be no
</p>
<p>difficulty as to the course the Crown should adopt, because the 56
</p>
<p>Geo. III. is still in force, and although, in certain cases, the witnesses
</p>
<p>may be sworn before the Grand Jury, yet it is still open to adopt the
</p>
<p>ancient course.
</p>
<p>The main question then is upon the construction of the 1 & 2
</p>
<p>Vict. It is said that it extends to all cases where bills of in-
</p>
<p>dictment are sent before a Grand Jury, and consequently that it ex-
</p>
<p>tends to this Court ; we say, on the contrary, that it does not extend to
</p>
<p>this Court, and whether the Court of Queen's Bench has been omitted
</p>
<p>through design or by accident, in neither case can the Court insert a
</p>
<p>provision which is not to be found in the Act. The title of the Act,
</p>
<p>which has been adverted to, does not carry with it the weight sought
</p>
<p>to be attached to it. The language of it is satisfied by there being
</p>
<p>Grand Juries to which it would apply; it omits the word " all;" it
</p>
<p>merely says, " the Foreman of Grand Juries," and this furnishes an
</p>
<p>argument that it was not the intention of the Legislature to extend
</p>
<p>it to every case. But it is said that the preamble being general,
</p>
<p>will afford a clue to the construction of the entire Act. Now what
</p>
<p>was the mischief to be remedied by this Act? it was the delay
</p>
<p>which occurred by the administration of oaths in open Court. The
</p>
<p>question then is, where did that delay occur which produced
</p>
<p>such an inconvenience as to call for the interposition of the Le-

</p>
<p>gislature ? A great delay and inconvenience had occurred at
</p>
<p>the Assizes and Quarter Sessions, but not in the Queen's Bench,
</p>
<p>where in the interval between the passing of both Acts, few bills
</p>
<p>had been sent before the Grand Jury, and consequently but little
</p>
<p>inconvenience could be felt. It is plain, therefore, that the Legis-
</p>
<p>lature had not the Queen's Bench in view when passing the Act,
</p>
<p>and, therefore, it only can apply to those Courts where the mischief
</p>
<p>was felt, and required a remedy, and the Court will not extend the
</p>
<p>Statute beyond the mischief to be remedied, more particularly where
</p>
<p>there are no words to warrant such a construction. So far then as the
</p>
<p>preamble goes, there is no weight in the argument. Let us then look
</p>
<p>to the enacting part of the Statute; it says : " that in all cases where
</p>
<p>bills of indictment are to be laid before Grand Juries in Ireland."
</p>
<p>Now these words are certainly very general ; Grand Juries are em-
</p>
<p>pannelled as well in the Queen's Bench as at the Assizes or Sessions;
</p>
<p>M*
</p>
<p>82*
</p>
<p>they therefore might he extended to the Queen's Bench, were it not
</p>
<p>for the following portion of the sentence, " the Clerk of the Crown
</p>
<p>at the Assizes, and Clerk of the Peace at Sessions, &c." When
</p>
<p>you consider the mischief to be remedied, which was the delay that
</p>
<p>existed at the time, it is plain that this sentence should be read
</p>
<p>thus: "that all Grand Juries at Assizes in Ireland," &c. The
</p>
<p>Act provides by negative words, that no Foreman shall have power
</p>
<p>to administer the oath unless the names are endorsed ; now the
</p>
<p>plain meaning of this is, that the Foreman has no original jurisdic-
</p>
<p>tion. Suppose the names were endorsed on the bill and sent to the
</p>
<p>Grand Jury, and suppose that they were not satisfied with the tes-
</p>
<p>timony of those witnesses, and that it was disclosed to them that
</p>
<p>there was another witness whose name had not been endorsed,
</p>
<p>would it be competent for them to examine this witness ? How would
</p>
<p>you give effect in such case to the negative words of the Act ? It
</p>
<p>follows, therefore, that the authority given to the Foreman was not
</p>
<p>an original authority, but consequent upon the act done by the
</p>
<p>officer provided by the Act. Now who is the officer provided to
</p>
<p>give this authority to the Foreman to administer the oath ? You
</p>
<p>cannot assume that the Legislature intended to delegate the juris-
</p>
<p>diction to the Clerk of the Crown of the Queen's Bench without
</p>
<p>naming him. Suppose the words, " Clerk of the Crown at the
</p>
<p>Assizes," had been omitted, and the sentence were to run thus : that
</p>
<p>the Clerk of the Peace was to endorse the names ; would it not be
</p>
<p>going far to say, that it1?Xtended to every possible tribunal, that it
</p>
<p>extended to tribunals which had not been mentioned? This is in
</p>
<p>some degree a penal enactment ; every Act abridging the rights or
</p>
<p>privileges of the accused well deserves to be called a penal enactment.
</p>
<p>We did consider it of importance to have got the names of those
</p>
<p>witnesses, and if the Act had not passed, we would have been enti-
</p>
<p>tled to that benefit, and when construing the Act which deprives us
</p>
<p>of this benefit, you should not go further than the words of the Act
</p>
<p>will warrant. Look to the peculiar phraseology of the Act. It does
</p>
<p>not say the Clerk of the Crown generally, but the Clerk of the

</p>
<p>Crown at Assizes, and when you find the Legislature using those
</p>
<p>words, it affords a clue to what they intended, that is, that where they
</p>
<p>used the general words, " in all cases," they intended, " in all cases
</p>
<p>at Assizes or Quarter Sessions." If it was the intention of the Le-
</p>
<p>gislature to go beyond those tribunals, why not say so? But they
</p>
<p>have not said so ; on the contrary, in pointing out the machinery to
</p>
<p>carry the object of the Act into execution, they have enumerated
</p>
<p>two tribunals, and there is nothing in the Act to enable the Court
</p>
<p>to extend it to the Queen's Bench ; there is no mention made of an
</p>
<p>officer of the Queen's Bench. As to the Commission Courts, it is
</p>
<p>not necessary forme to consider whether it includes those Courts.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin.  I think it is essential to your argument
</p>
<p>to show that it is confined to the Assizes and Quarter Sessions.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore I can only say that I am not apprised of the na-
</p>
<p>ture of that Court, but unless the Commission Court is to be consi-
</p>
<p>83*
</p>
<p>dered a Court of Assize, it is as much out of the operation of this
</p>
<p>Act as the Court of Queen's Bench.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  What construction would you put on
</p>
<p>the words " so empannelled ?"
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore.  That must mean that the Clerk of the Crown is to
</p>
<p>send the bill to the Grand Jury so empannelled at Assizes, the tri-
</p>
<p>bunal to which he so belonged.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  I should think "so empannelled" re-
</p>
<p>ferred to the antecedent words " all Grand Juries in Ireland."
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore.  As to the word " Assizes," it cannot be considered
</p>
<p>to apply to the Queen's Bench, at least in the common understand-
</p>
<p>ing. The Court, when the words are plain and distinct, and have a
</p>
<p>recognized meaning, are not to see, whether at any former period
</p>
<p>they had a different meaning, and whether this Court had ever been
</p>
<p>designated a Court of Assize ; at least it is not the natural significa-
</p>
<p>tion of the term intended by the Act, and the Court should not go
</p>
<p>out of the Act to deprive the accused party of a privilege.
</p>
<p>Sir Colman 0" Loghlen referred to the 36 Geo. III. c. 20, s. 14,
</p>
<p>in which a clear distinction is taken between the Assizes and the
</p>
<p>Queen's Bench.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor- General, in reply.  My Lords, with regard to the
</p>
<p>Statute 29 Geo. II. c. 14, which was referred to on the other side,
</p>
<p>for the purpose of shewing that the Legislature was conscious, by
</p>
<p>using the word " Assizes" in two preceding Acts, they had not in-
</p>
<p>cluded the Queen's Bench, and that they, therefore, thought it ne-
</p>
<p>cessary to pass that Act, for the purpose of extending the pro-
</p>
<p>visions of those Acts to the Queen's Bench; that Act is a declaratory
</p>
<p>Act, and so far from being an authority in their favour is a decla-
</p>
<p>ration by the Legislature that those Acts did include, and were
</p>
<p>intended to include, the Queen's Bench.
</p>
<p>But the substantial question in this case is the construction of
</p>
<p>the 1 & 2 Vict. The construction sought to be put on this Statute is
</p>
<p>this, that at the Assizes, popularly speaking, and the Quarter Ses-
</p>
<p>sions, the old mode of administering the oath to witnesses is to be

</p>
<p>done away with, but that in all other cases the law should continue
</p>
<p>as it was under the 56 Geo. III. Before the Court will adopt such
</p>
<p>a construction, attended with those consequences which have been
</p>
<p>already alluded to, they would be bound, if necessary, to strain the
</p>
<p>language of the Act in order to avoid giving it such an interpreta-
</p>
<p>tion. It is the duty of the Court to further the intention of the
</p>
<p>Legislature, when it is discernible by the Act, though words may
</p>
<p>not have been adopted sufficient, if technically and narrowly con-
</p>
<p>strued, to explain that intention. The rules of construction of Acts
</p>
<p>of Parliament are very clearly laid down in I Plow. Com. 36 ; 2 Id.
</p>
<p>467; Doe d. By "mater \. Brandling, 7B.&C. 660, where Lord Ten-
</p>
<p>terden says : " In construing Acts of Parliament, the Court are to look
</p>
<p>" not only at the language of the preamble, or of any particular clause,
</p>
<p>" but at the language of the whole Act, and if they find in the pre-
</p>
<p>a amble, or in any particular clause, an expression not so large and
</p>
<p>" extensive in its import as those used in other parts of the Act,
</p>
<p>84*
</p>
<p>" and upon a view of the whole Act, they can collect, from the
</p>
<p>" more large and extensive expressions used in other parts, the real
</p>
<p>" intention of the Legislature, it is their duty to give effect to the
</p>
<p>" larger expressions, notwithstanding the phrases of less extensive
</p>
<p>" import in the preamble, or any particular clause." Bryant's
</p>
<p>Case, 5 T. K. 509 ; 2 Inst. 156, 256; Saunders v. Plummer, 0.
</p>
<p>Bridg. 226; 1 Saund. 217; Jolmes v. Jolmes, 3 D. P. C. 15.
</p>
<p>Upon those authorities, it is plain the Court are bound to give effect
</p>
<p>to what upon the whole Act they find the intention of the Legisla-
</p>
<p>ture, notwithstanding it has been inaccurately expressed. Now,
</p>
<p>with regard to the Statute itself, I think I shall be able to show that
</p>
<p>it is general in its operation. The Statute of 56 Geo. III. is now
</p>
<p>conceded to be universal in its application, although that Act men-
</p>
<p>tions no Court, but is a general enactment to correct a vicious
</p>
<p>practice of sending informations before a Grand Jury, and the
</p>
<p>Grand Jury finding bills upon those informations, without any
</p>
<p>witnesses being examined in support of them. It is said that this
</p>
<p>Act has not been repealed. I admit the Statute of Vict, does not
</p>
<p>use the word " repeal," but it contains enactments inconsistent with
</p>
<p>the enactments of 56 Geo. III., and substitutes others for them,
</p>
<p>and so far as it substitutes enactments for the 56 Geo. III., the
</p>
<p>Court is bound to follow the Statute of Vict. The 56 Geo. III.
</p>
<p>being then confessedly universal, and the Legislature having found
</p>
<p>that certain provisions in it were salutary, and should be conti-
</p>
<p>nued, but that other regulations in that Act were inconvenient
</p>
<p>and ought to be discontinued, they accordingly stated in the
</p>
<p>Statute of Vict, that was the state of things which required a re-
</p>
<p>medy. The title of the Act is not cited with a view to control the
</p>
<p>Court, but to show the intention of the Legislature. They say we
</p>
<p>are calling on the Court to alter the Act of Parliament ; on the con-
</p>
<p>trary, they are calling on the Court to make an alteration, by in-
</p>
<p>troducing words into the Act. The 1 &2 Vict, recites, " that the
</p>
<p>" provision for the viva voce examination of witnesses was most
</p>
<p>" salutary," that is, that it was most salutary in every case, and as

</p>
<p>universal as the 56 Geo. III., yet the Legislature using this uni-
</p>
<p>versal language, it is contended they only extended those salutary
</p>
<p>provisions to one or two classes of cases. It then says : " but the ad-
</p>
<p>" ministration of the oath had been productive of delay and other
</p>
<p>" inconveniences, for remedy whereof," that is of this universal
</p>
<p>inconvenience, " for remedy whereof be it enacted, that in all cases."
</p>
<p>Now according to the argument on the other side, for those words
</p>
<p>" all cases," you should insert " certain cases." " Where bills of
</p>
<p>indictment are laid before Grand Juries in Ireland;" here again, to
</p>
<p>sustain their argument, they are obliged to take the word "Assizes,"
</p>
<p>and interpolate it after " Grand Jury," and they say it should be
</p>
<p>read thus: " In certain cases where bills of indictment are laid be-
</p>
<p>fore Grand Juries at Assizes in Ireland." But it is said, that this
</p>
<p>has been a casus omissus in the Act ; if there has been a casus
</p>
<p>omissus it is not in the body of the Act, but in the machinery to
</p>
<p>carry the Act into execution. Now without introducing any new
</p>
<p>85*
</p>
<p>words into the Statute, if, after the word " consideration," you
</p>
<p>read the following words, " the Clerk of the Crown at the Assizes,
</p>
<p>" and Clerk of the Peace at the Quarter Sessions, or his or their
</p>
<p>" deputy, shall endorse upon the back of each bill of indictment,
</p>
<p>" the name or names of the witnesses for the Crown in support of
</p>
<p>" such bill, and shall send the same so endorsed to the Grand
</p>
<p>" Jury," in a parenthesis, this will remove any difficulty. With
</p>
<p>regard to the words " so empannelled," the word " so" must be con-
</p>
<p>strued as synonimous with " there," that is, whenever Grand Juries
</p>
<p>are empannelled they are to find the bills of indictment upon
</p>
<p>the testimony of witnesses sworn in a certain manner ; and that if
</p>
<p>this be at Assizes, the Clerk of the Crown, and if at Quarter Ses-
</p>
<p>sions, the Clerk of the Peace, shall endorse the names. But it is
</p>
<p>said, the Clerk of the Crown in the Queen's Bench has no juris-
</p>
<p>diction to endorse the names, not being mentioned in the Act ; how-
</p>
<p>ever, when a duty is directed to be done by an Act of Parliament, and
</p>
<p>the person to do that is not named, it is to be done by the party to
</p>
<p>whom that duty usually belongs. It is said that the practice in this
</p>
<p>case shonld not be relied on, and that communis error nonfacit
</p>
<p>jus ; but even if there was any doubt as to the correctness of this
</p>
<p>practice, which there is not, yet the Court, in order to prevent a
</p>
<p>public mischief, and to prevent injustice being done, should adopt
</p>
<p>that practice. But there is nothing doubtful in the words, we do
</p>
<p>not seek to alter them, but they seek to curtail their effect by
</p>
<p>this supposed inconsistency. They say the Clerk of the Crown at
</p>
<p>the Assizes, or the Clerk of the Peace at the Sessions, shall send
</p>
<p>the bills to all Grand Juries. Now that could not be done, for
</p>
<p>they are not the persons to do so in every case ; yet they say,
</p>
<p>that the words " Clerk of the Crown and Clerk of the Peace" are to
</p>
<p>be the leading words of the Act ; they admit the prior words are
</p>
<p>large enough to include every Court, but they say they are to be
</p>
<p>controlled by the subsequent words, and that these latter words
</p>
<p>are to define the extent of the Act, and that they are entitled to
</p>
<p>select particular words of the Statute, not for the purpose of ex-

</p>
<p>WEDNESDAY, November 22.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  In this case of the Queen v. Daniel
</p>
<p>O' Connell and others, it becomes my duty to deliver my opinion
</p>
<p>and judgment, in which, I am happy to say, I have the concurrence
</p>
<p>of my brethren on the Bench. The case has been argued with great
</p>
<p>anxiety, I may say, and with great ability on both sides. No doubt
</p>
<p>it is a case of peculiar importance as affecting the criminal adminis-
</p>
<p>tration of justice in this country, not only as regards the present
</p>
<p>parties before the Court, but also as relates to all the criminal con-
</p>
<p>86*
</p>
<p>victions which have taken place in the city of Dublin, at the com-
</p>
<p>missions of Oyer and Terminer there, and in the county of Dublin,
</p>
<p>and at the Special Commissions in the country.
</p>
<p>The principal question turns upon the true construction of the
</p>
<p>Statute 1 & 2 Vict. c. 37. It is contended on the part of the tra-
</p>
<p>versers, who have put in the present plea, that the operation of that
</p>
<p>Act is to extend only to cases where the officers employed to carry
</p>
<p>the Act into execution were the Clerks of the Crown on Circuit, or
</p>
<p>the Clerks of the Peace at Quarter Sessions; on the other hand, it
</p>
<p>is contended on behalf of the Crown, that that is a narrow con-
</p>
<p>struction of the Act, not according to the purport and intention of
</p>
<p>it, and that it ought to be held to extend to cases going before Grand
</p>
<p>Juries of the county and the county of the city of Dublin, either in
</p>
<p>the Court of Queen's Bench, or before the Commissions of Oyer
</p>
<p>and Terminer, or at the Special Commissions in the country. I feel
</p>
<p>bound to say, after a great deal of anxious deliberation given to this
</p>
<p>case, and taking advantage of the able arguments of counsel, that
</p>
<p>the decision of my mind, and that without much doubt, is, that the
</p>
<p>construction given to the Act by the counsel for the Crown is the
</p>
<p>right and the true one. Certainly it would be an opening to a very
</p>
<p>strange and much to be lamented conclusion, if the Court should
</p>
<p>be of opinion, that all which has been done in the way of passing
</p>
<p>bills before Grand Juries at Special Commissions, or in the Court
</p>
<p>of Queen's Bench, has been erroneous, and that would be the neces-
</p>
<p>sary result, if the construction put upon this Act by the traversers'
</p>
<p>counsel should be held to be the true and just one ; however, if,
</p>
<p>notwithstanding this unfortunate conclusion, the Court should see,
</p>
<p>that upon elaborate argument it has been demonstrated, that it is
</p>
<p>acting in error, whatever the consequence be, the law must be put
</p>
<p>in its proper bearing and position, and must take its course. I
</p>
<p>cannot but feel satisfaction, that this general inconvenience, and
</p>
<p>most disastrous consequence, will not take place by reason of the
</p>
<p>view the Court have come to upon the construction of this Act.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General began his argument by a statement of two

</p>
<p>certain charges made shortly after the passing of this Act, by the
</p>
<p>two Judges who respectively presided at the Commission of Oyer
</p>
<p>and Terminer in the city of Dublin ; I mean the late Chief Baron
</p>
<p>Woulfe, and Mr. Justice Moore, on one occasion, and on another
</p>
<p>occasion by Chief Justice Doherty, and Mr. Justice Johnson ; upon
</p>
<p>each of which occasions, the leading Judge, on behalf of himself
</p>
<p>and his brother Judge, directed the attention of the Commission
</p>
<p>Grand Jury to the subject matter of this Act. They did then re-
</p>
<p>spectively and most deliberately give their opinion, that they were
</p>
<p>within the operation of the Act in question, and charged the Jury
</p>
<p>accordingly. This same practice has been continued to the present
</p>
<p>time. Upon those two occasions no doubt the construction of
</p>
<p>this Act was deliberately thought upon and discussed by the Judges
</p>
<p>in whose names these two charges were delivered, and it is to be
</p>
<p>inferred that the other Judges, who have since presided at those
</p>
<p>Commissions, and at the Special Commissions in the country con-
</p>
<p>87*
</p>
<p>curred in the view so taken by those respective Judges, and
</p>
<p>must have been of opinion that they were not sitting coram
</p>
<p>non judice, but within the operation and meaning of the Act
</p>
<p>of Parliament. It has been asserted, first, that this practice
</p>
<p>has been of too short continuance to be looked upon as law
</p>
<p>upon the subject ; I do not understand the Crown to put the ques-
</p>
<p>tion upon such an assumption. They have only to put it forward as
</p>
<p>showing the concurrence of the Judges upon the law so pronounced
</p>
<p>upon, and I will say that the argument of the traversers' counsel
</p>
<p>assumed a very extraordinary sort of shape, when, having first made
</p>
<p>the objection, that in point of time the practice and usage were not
</p>
<p>sufficient, they then unreservedly announced the fact, that all the
</p>
<p>Judges had been acting erroneously, and argued that inasmuch as
</p>
<p>all were wrong and in error, their common error could not establish
</p>
<p>the law upon the subject. It is not because Judges have done so
</p>
<p>and so, but because, in the deliberate execution of their judicial dis-
</p>
<p>cretion, they felt themselves called upon to give an interpretation
</p>
<p>to the Act ; that the opinion of the Judges so expressed has been
</p>
<p>brought forward as an authoritative direction to the present Judges
</p>
<p>when they are called upon in a like way to give their interpretation
</p>
<p>to the Act in question. The concurrence in opinion of those Judges
</p>
<p>is the highest authority that could be produced before us for direct-
</p>
<p>ing our judgment upon the present occasion. But we are called upon
</p>
<p>to give our interpretation to this Act, and though I do not say we
</p>
<p>are to be governed altogether by the views of preceding Judges,
</p>
<p>yet I must say for myself, I would be much influenced by their
</p>
<p>authority, when called upon to give a judgment upon a point that
</p>
<p>has passed under their consideration on a previous occasion.
</p>
<p>I will go now to consider what the Act in question is. I have
</p>
<p>already stated generally the different views of the construction of the
</p>
<p>Act, by the traversers and the Crown. Before I come to the consi-
</p>
<p>deration and detail of the substance of the Act, in order to arrive at
</p>
<p>its construction, I think it well to state certain rules with regard to
</p>
<p>the construction of Acts of Parliament, and how far eminent Judges

</p>
<p>upon former and other occasions have felt themselves bound to
</p>
<p>take into consideration the various circumstances that are to be
</p>
<p>considered in arriving at a just interpretation of an Act of Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment concerning which there is any difficulty whatsoever. The
</p>
<p>first rule I would mention is laid down by one of the most eminent
</p>
<p>Judges who ever graced the English Bench, and whose authority
</p>
<p>has been mainly relied on by the counsel for the traversers in their
</p>
<p>argument of this case, I mean Lord Tenterden, and I am willing
</p>
<p>to bring his opinion to bear upon the question, as to what is to be
</p>
<p>taken into consideration upon the construction of Acts of Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment. In Doe A. By water v.Bradling, 7 B. & C. 660, he says:
</p>
<p>" The question in this case depends entirely on the construction of
</p>
<p>" a particular Act of Parliament. In construing Acts of Parliament
</p>
<p>" the Court are to look not only at the language of the preamble,
</p>
<p>88*
</p>
<p>" or of any particular clause, but at the language of the whole Act,
</p>
<p>" and if they find in the preamble, or in any particular clause, an
</p>
<p>" expression not so large and extensive in its import as those used
</p>
<p>" in other parts of the Act, and upon a view of the whole Act they
</p>
<p>" can collect from the more large and extensive expressions used
</p>
<p>" in other parts, the real intention of the Legislature, it is their
</p>
<p>" duty to give effect to the larger expressions, notwithstanding the
</p>
<p>" phrases of less extensive import in the preamble or any particular
</p>
<p>" clause." In the progress of the argument it was insisted, first,
</p>
<p>that the title was no part of the Act, secondly, that the preamble
</p>
<p>was no part of the Act. I do not know how this argument could
</p>
<p>be maintained by reference to the authority of Lord Tenterden,
</p>
<p>whose authority they do not dispute. This is not merely the
</p>
<p>authority of Lord Tenterden, but of common sense, that when
</p>
<p>called upon to put a meaning on a given instrument, you must
</p>
<p>take it all together and not by parts. When the expression is
</p>
<p>used that the preamble is no part of the Act, it can only mean
</p>
<p>no part of the enactment, nevertheless it is part of the Act, and
</p>
<p>you cannot take the Act without it, and you must take it into
</p>
<p>consideration when you come to give an interpretation of the
</p>
<p>Act. These are not the only rules of construction laid down by
</p>
<p>unquestionable authority in the various books that have been re-
</p>
<p>ferred to, many of which I shall pass by, because the subject matter
</p>
<p>is fully set out in the other authorities which I am now about to
</p>
<p>state. I look upon this as an additional rule of construction, that
</p>
<p>where an Act is passed for the public benefit, the Court are bound
</p>
<p>to give it such a construction as will advance the remedy intended
</p>
<p>to be provided for and repress the mischief, and T will say also,
</p>
<p>that this rule is to be carried into effect, not merely in the con-
</p>
<p>struction of ordinary Acts of Parliament, but thatthei-e is no differ-
</p>
<p>ence if the Act in question happens to be penal. The first passage I
</p>
<p>shall refer to is in Plow. Com. 36. There is given an instance of the
</p>
<p>way in which the Court has absolutely strained the words of an Act
</p>
<p>of Parliament for the purpose of giving it a construction that would
</p>

</p>
<p>promote the remedy and repress the mischief. The author there says :
</p>
<p>" Therefore the Statute de circumspecte agatis, which says, use
</p>
<p>" yourself circumspectly in all matters concerning the Bishop of
</p>
<p>" Norwich and his clergy, is nevertheless extended to all other
</p>
<p>" Bishops;" that is, not being by the words of the Act, but the
</p>
<p>manifest and apparent intention concerning which no doubt can be
</p>
<p>entertained, that it was consistent with the public welfare to extend
</p>
<p>the Act beyond the language of it, if such appears to be the plain
</p>
<p>intention of the Legislature. So in that case there was no reason
</p>
<p>to confine it to the Bishop of Norwich, and it was held to apply, not
</p>
<p>merely to the Bishop of Norwich, but to every other Bishop
</p>
<p>similarly circumstanced, therefore to every Bishop in England. In the
</p>
<p>case of Stradling v. Morgan, Plow. Com. 205, the rules are further
</p>
<p>extended with regard to the interpretation of Acts of Parliament
</p>
<p>and the exposition that they are to receive. Again, in the same
</p>
<p>89*
</p>
<p>book the same subject is considered ; lie speaks of two kinds of
</p>
<p>equity to be taken into consideration in the construction of a Sta-
</p>
<p>tute, which has been already adverted to in the passage I have read,
</p>
<p>and is more fully given and observed on in p. 467. Several other
</p>
<p>instances of a similar nature are put ; one of them is essential, it is an
</p>
<p>application of the same rule to a capital case. By the words of an Act
</p>
<p>of Parliament it was made a capital felony to steal horses, and that
</p>
<p>was applied by the equity of the Act of Parliament to stealing a
</p>
<p>horse; that was a stronger case than the present; it was not only a
</p>
<p>penal Statute, but a Statute inflicting punishment of a capital na-
</p>
<p>ture, and if it be said that the law is penal in this case, it may be
</p>
<p>answered, so it was in the other case ; equity knows no difference.
</p>
<p>A great many similar cases have been cited and referred to, particu-
</p>
<p>larly in 2 Inst. pp. 256, 398, 431 ; these are not merely antiquated
</p>
<p>law, and, as intimated by the counsel for the traversers, no longer
</p>
<p>law, but in confirmation of those is the high authority of Lord El-
</p>
<p>lenborough in JRexv. Inhabitants of Ever don, 9 East, 105, where,
</p>
<p>in speaking of an Act, he says: " this is the plain sense and spirit
</p>
<p>" of the Act, though somewhat straining upon the words of it ; but
</p>
<p>" no other construction can be put upon them, consistently with the
</p>
<p>" general object of the Act. And in doing this, we do not go fur-
</p>
<p>" ther against the letter of the Act, than was done in the case re-
</p>
<p>" ferred to, where the description of a person not having any child,
</p>
<p>" was construed to mean not having any child which could be a
</p>
<p>" burthen to the parish ;" this latter being narrow and inconsistent,
</p>
<p>they adopted a construction more consistent with the Act.
</p>
<p>Having premised these general rules of construction, I now come
</p>
<p>to the consideration of the Act itself. I come to this consideration,
</p>
<p>having referred to the practice of all the Judges since the passing of
</p>
<p>the Act of Parliament, from which time only there could be any
</p>
<p>decisions. The Act is the 1, 2 Vic. c. 37. It contains a history
</p>
<p>of all that has passed in this country for a period of years, upon the
</p>
<p>subject matter and mode of swearing witnesses before Grand Juries
</p>
<p>up to the time of the passing of the Act. It is entitled an " Act to

</p>
<p>" empower the Foreman or any other member of Grand Juries in
</p>
<p>" Ireland to administer oaths to witnesses on bills of indictment."
</p>
<p>I agree with the counsel for the traversers in saying that the title of
</p>
<p>an Act of Parliament is not, strictly speaking, a part of it, and that
</p>
<p>you cannot reform the enacting part of the Act by an inconsistent
</p>
<p>passage in the title ; but when we come to construe an Act of Par-
</p>
<p>liament, and to make out the meaning of the Legislature, it is per-
</p>
<p>fectly allowable and competent for the Court to take into their con-
</p>
<p>sideration, what the Legislature had in view when they passed this
</p>
<p>Act  what was the mischief  and what was the remedy provided
</p>
<p>for that mischief ; and in common sense I will say, in order to assist
</p>
<p>me in coming to an interpretation, I will look to every part of the
</p>
<p>Act calculated to throw light upon that subject. Now the title of
</p>
<p>this Act is not the title of an Act about to be passed for any parti-
</p>
<p>cular part of Ireland, it is for all parts of Ireland, one part as much
</p>
<p>as another, and there is no reason to control the general applica-
</p>
<p>90*
</p>
<p>tion of the general words contained in the title, inasmuch as the
</p>
<p>mischief to he provided against was equally extensive throughout.
</p>
<p>It recites: " Whereas by an Act passed in the 56 Geo. III., recit-
</p>
<p>" ing that a practice had prevailed in many of the Grand Juries in
</p>
<p>" Ireland, to find bills of indictment without examining witnesses
</p>
<p>" for the Crown." It recites that to be a prevalent evil in various
</p>
<p>parts of Ireland. No man reading this Act, can question but that
</p>
<p>evil recited in the 56 Geo. III., was one which prevailed as well in
</p>
<p>the city of Dublin, and in the Court of Queen's Bench, as in other
</p>
<p>parts of the country, and required the general application of the
</p>
<p>Act of Parliament to correct this abuse, as much in one part of Ire-
</p>
<p>land, Dublin included, as another. It then, having recited the
</p>
<p>enactments of the 56 Geo. III., goes on to say what happened since
</p>
<p>the passing of that Act: " Whereas the provisions for the viva voce
</p>
<p>" examination of witnesses by the Grand Jury, upon the conside-
</p>
<p>" ration of bills of indictment, has been found most salutary, but
</p>
<p>" the administration of the oath in Court has been found productive
</p>
<p>" of delay and other inconveniences." Now, I should observe, that
</p>
<p>I cannot adopt the argument brought forward, however ingenious ;
</p>
<p>for I will not take the ipse dixit of any counsel against an express
</p>
<p>recital in an Act of Parliament, which recites that delay and incon-
</p>
<p>venience does result from the practice of swearing witnesses in open
</p>
<p>Court, and I will not go beyond that, nor will I listen to the asser-
</p>
<p>tion that there was no delay or inconvenience, when the Act tells
</p>
<p>me in express terms that there was, and that it was in order to meet
</p>
<p>and remedy that evil it was passed. It is demonstrated by the Act
</p>
<p>that an evil did exist, of a character so serious as to call for the in-
</p>
<p>terposition of the Legislature. What was that evil ? The delay
</p>
<p>and inconvenience arising from the practice of witnesses being
</p>
<p>sworn in open Court. I should wish to know was that a mischief
</p>
<p>which prevailed in the country parts of Ireland, but not in Dublin.
</p>
<p>Certainly that was not what the Legislature contemplated. They
</p>
<p>contemplated an evil which existed as much in Dublin before the
</p>
<p>Commission Courts of Oyer and Terminer, as it did before any

</p>
<p>Assize town or Court in the country. Then we have an existing
</p>
<p>evil, general and universal through the country, and we have the
</p>
<p>Legislature reforming that evil which they recited to exist. Now
</p>
<p>ab ante one would say, if the Legislature were about to reform a
</p>
<p>general evil, their intention would be to pass an Act as general as
</p>
<p>the evil. If that be so, and I really think no body can deny it without
</p>
<p>exercising ingenuity, and looking to it in plain common sense, the
</p>
<p>obvious meaning and intention a man is to expect from the Legis-
</p>
<p>lature reciting such an evil, is, that it would be found that the re-
</p>
<p>medy is as extensive as the evil they complained of. If so what
</p>
<p>could be expected but that the enactment, in consonance with the
</p>
<p>plain intention of the Legislature, should be an Act so general as
</p>
<p>to repress the evil wherever found. What reason can be suggested
</p>
<p>for giving the Act a contrary construction, or what sort of fatuity
</p>
<p>was it supposed could influence a Legislature to act in such a way
</p>
<p>as to frustrate their object and intention, for that would be their ob-
</p>
<p>91*
</p>
<p>ject according to the argument of the traversers' counsel. " For
</p>
<p>" remedy whereof be it enacted, that in all case where bills of in-
</p>
<p>" dictment are laid before Grand Juries in Ireland for their con-
</p>
<p>" sideration." There the Legislature contemplated, as might be
</p>
<p>expected from the insertion of the recital, that this remedial Statute
</p>
<p>they were about to pass, was to be as extensive in its operation as
</p>
<p>the mischief they complained of, and that no case was to be ex-
</p>
<p>cepted from the operation of it, no reason being assigned why it
</p>
<p>should be excepted. " In all cases," it says, " where bills of in-
</p>
<p>" dictment are to be laid before Grand Juries in Ireland for their
</p>
<p>" consideration, the Clerk of the Crown at the Assizes, and Clerk
</p>
<p>" of the Peace at Quarter Sessions, or his or their deputy," that is,
</p>
<p>when such officer shall exist. They are instances that such officer
</p>
<p>should act in pursuance of the operation of the Act, which is as
</p>
<p>general as language can make it, and is to operate in all cases.
</p>
<p>Now the Clerk of the Crown at Assizes, and the Clerk of the Peace
</p>
<p>at Quarter Sessions would be incompetent and unable to act in all
</p>
<p>cases ; they can only act in their respective counties. Wherever
</p>
<p>they exist, they are the proper officers called on to put this Act
</p>
<p>into execution, that is, not in exclusion of other cases where
</p>
<p>similar and proper officers exist, though not distinctly enumerated in
</p>
<p>the Act. Those that are particularised are instar omnium, and put by
</p>
<p>way of example, that is, when those officers do exist they shall be
</p>
<p>the persons to carry the Act into execution ; but they do not exclude
</p>
<p>the duty from being performed by other officers similarly situated,
</p>
<p>who in a case within the same mischief are called on to carry the
</p>
<p>Act into execution ; and in cases where there was no Clerk of the
</p>
<p>Crown at the Assizes, or Clerk of the Peace at the Sessions, as at
</p>
<p>the Commission Court in Dublin, whenever the services of a similar
</p>
<p>officer are required, as, for instance, the Clerk of the Crown in this
</p>
<p>Court, or the Clerk of the Crown of the Commission Court, they are
</p>
<p>to be the persons to carry the Act into operation. Give it that mean 
</p>
<p>ing, then the words " in all cases" will be explained, whereas give it
</p>
<p>a contrary meaning, then those words will apply to cases where such

</p>
<p>officers have not a power of acting. This case therefore is unlike
</p>
<p>several of the cases that have been cited. It is not a case where by
</p>
<p>adhering to the literal construction we can carry out the intention
</p>
<p>of the Act, because the Clerk of the Crown at the Assizes, or the
</p>
<p>Clerk of the Peace at Quarter Sessions would have no jurisdiction
</p>
<p>to interfere in the Court of Queen's Bench, or the Commission Court
</p>
<p>in Dublin, and to give it such a construction would be to frustrate
</p>
<p>the intention of the Act. I find in this way of construing the Act
</p>
<p>of Parliament, that no part of it is in opposition to another, but
</p>
<p>each part bears on the other, and all cooperate to the same end.
</p>
<p>Then comes the proviso : " provided always, that the said oath or
</p>
<p>" affirmation is not to be in addition to, but in lieu of that hereto-
</p>
<p>" fore administered under the provisions of the 56 Geo. III.," that
</p>
<p>appears to furnish a further argument on the same view of the sub-
</p>
<p>ject ; there is an express proviso, that the oath to be administered
</p>
<p>by the Grand Juries is not to be in addition to, but in lieu of the
</p>
<p>92*
</p>
<p>oath to be administered by the 56 Geo. III. ; it is to be a substitution
</p>
<p>for that; it therefore necessarily follows, it is to be as extensive as the
</p>
<p>oath in lieu of which it is substituted  it is to be a complete substitu-
</p>
<p>tion, not an addition. Then comes the further proviso: " That no
</p>
<p>" Foreman of any Grand Jury, nor any other member therof, shall
</p>
<p>" have power to administer such oath or affirmation to, or to examine
</p>
<p>" any witness in support of any bill of indictment, whose name shall
</p>
<p>" not have been previously endorsed on such bill of indictment by the
</p>
<p>" Clerk of the Crown, or Clerk of the Peace, respectively ;" not saying-
</p>
<p>such Clerk of the Crown, or such Clerk of the Peace, nor making
</p>
<p>any distinct reference to the Clerk of the Crown, or Clerk of the
</p>
<p>Peace, but wherever there is to be an oath administered, the witnesses'
</p>
<p>names must be endorsed on the bill by the Clerk of the Crown, or
</p>
<p>Clerk of the Peace generally; the meaning was, that they were the
</p>
<p>officers to put the machinery in motion, as an example only, but they
</p>
<p>do not exclude the application of the Act to all similar instances, and
</p>
<p>according to various cases, that which falls within the same rule falls
</p>
<p>within the same remedy. That is the view I have taken upon the
</p>
<p>subject, and I do not find that the ingenuity of the traversers' counsel
</p>
<p>has had the effect of raising a doubt upon my mind upon the con-
</p>
<p>struction of the Act.
</p>
<p>Another question has been raised, which has not been overlooked
</p>
<p>by the counsel for the Crown, though not pressed by them ; and in the
</p>
<p>view I have taken of the case, it is unnecessary I should give any
</p>
<p>opinion with regard to this point of form; but if called upon to make
</p>
<p>a decision as to it, I should be of opinion that the plea was ill. It is
</p>
<p>a dilatory plea in contemplation of law; a kind of pleading to which
</p>
<p>no favour is held out by the law, because it tends rather to defeat than
</p>
<p>promote justice, and no strictness can be regarded as too great
</p>
<p>with regard to such pleading. I need not go through the cases upon
</p>
<p>the subject; they are found collected in 2 Sand. 203, a. ; Cro. Jac.
</p>
<p>82 ; 3 T. R. 185. There appears an insufficiency in the form of this
</p>
<p>plea. It is a plea to a bill of indictment, that one or two of the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses were not sworn in open court  that is, that it must be bad, not

</p>
<p>being found upon the testimony of witnesses sworn in open Court ; but
</p>
<p>the Act provides that the affirmation of witnesses shall be sufficient.
</p>
<p>Now, suppose this bill had been found upon the affirmation of Quakers,
</p>
<p>would that be a bad bill because it was not on sworn testimony ? I
</p>
<p>think not. Therefore, upon that ground, as well as upon the true con-
</p>
<p>struction of the Act of Parliament, I am of opinion that the plea is
</p>
<p>bad, and that the demurrer which has been put in, on behalf of the
</p>
<p>Crown, must be allowed.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Burton concurred.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  Ishallbest promotethe administration
</p>
<p>of justice by being silent on the subject, which has been so elaborately
</p>
<p>and learnedly discussed by my Lord Chief Justice. I do not enter into
</p>
<p>the discussion of the formal defect in the pleas at all ; I found my
</p>
<p>judgment on the Statute itself. I adopt the extended construction
</p>
<p>given to it by the Attorney-General, and which was the construction
</p>
<p>93*
</p>
<p>put on it in the first judicial consideration given to it, and which has
</p>
<p>been continued to the present time. I think that is the only one con-
</p>
<p>sistent with the context, and the only one which can effectuate the
</p>
<p>manifest intention of the Legislature appearing on the face of the
</p>
<p>Statute itself. It appears to me that the argument of the counsel for
</p>
<p>the traversers results entirely from considering what is a mere misde-
</p>
<p>scription or imperfect expression of the character of the officer by
</p>
<p>whom the bill is to be sent to the Grand Jury, as an essential part of
</p>
<p>the enactment. I, therefore, concur in the judgment of my Lord
</p>
<p>Chief Justice.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Pe ruin.  I think it right in this case, even at the ex-
</p>
<p>pense of a further consumption of the public time, to state the grounds
</p>
<p>on which I concur with the judgment of the Court. The question in this
</p>
<p>case is, whether, by the law of Ireland, a bill of indictment can be law-
</p>
<p>fully fuund on the testimony of witnesses not sworn in open court, but
</p>
<p>sworn in the Grand Jury room by the foreman, or some other member
</p>
<p>of the Grand Jury. This question dependson two Statutes ; the one is
</p>
<p>the 56 Geo. III. c. 87, the other the 1 & 2 Vic. c. 37, and upon their
</p>
<p>just construction. Many authorities have been cited not bearing upon
</p>
<p>the question that really arises, of which authorities, therefore, I shall
</p>
<p>take no notice ; and several positions have been contended for on the
</p>
<p>one side and on the other, which, in the view of the case which I
</p>
<p>deem it right to take, I do not consider it necessary to discuss, no
</p>
<p>question as to their applicability appearing to me to arise or to exist
</p>
<p>in this case. For instance, on the one side it has been argued that,
</p>
<p>though a case is not within the letter, it may be within the equity of
</p>
<p>the Statute, and may be extended to the mischief, though not provided
</p>
<p>for in terms. On the other side it was contended, that the Court
</p>
<p>should be bound strictly by the letter of the Statute, and that if any
</p>
<p>case, not within the letter of the Statute, requires a remedy, it must
</p>
<p>be left as a matter to be remedied by the Legislature. It does not ap-
</p>
<p>pear to me necessary to make any observation on that position. But
</p>
<p>one has been put forward, however, namely, that the Grand Jury
</p>
<p>may find a bill without evidence, and that the matter is not to be in-
</p>

</p>
<p>quired into by the Court; and against that position I beg leave de-
</p>
<p>cidedly to protest. I hold, that an indictment cannot lawfully be found
</p>
<p>in Ireland but upon the testimony of sworn witnesses, whose names
</p>
<p>are endorsed on the indictment. When I use the word "sworn," I
</p>
<p>mean persons to whom an oath has lawfully been administered, except
</p>
<p>in cases provided for by particular Statutes under particular circum-
</p>
<p>stances, as in the case of Quakers, Moravians, and Separatists, who
</p>
<p>may give their testimony on affirmation. Then the only question
</p>
<p>here is, whether the witnesses must be sworn in Court, or before the
</p>
<p>Grand Jury. Now the 56 Geo. III. c. 87, most distinctly and
</p>
<p>explicitly provides, that no bill of indictment can be returned a true
</p>
<p>bill, unless the same has been found by the Grand Jurors on the evi-
</p>
<p>dence of one or more witnesses for the Crown, sworn in Court, and
</p>
<p>produced before them. This Statute is declaratory of what the law
</p>
<p>was, as well as an enacting Statute. Under its provisions the witnesses
</p>
<p>94*
</p>
<p>were produced in open Court, and they were sworn in Court, and iheir
</p>
<p>names were endorsed by the Clerk of the Crown or the Clerk of the
</p>
<p>Peace, or by the proper officer of the Court for preparing and sending
</p>
<p>up the bill to the Grand Jury, no matter where that Grand Jury was
</p>
<p>empannelled. That was the duty either of the Clerk of the Crown or
</p>
<p>the Clerk of the Peace, and an imperative duty under this Statute to
</p>
<p>put the names of the witnesses on the bill ; and, accordingly, that
</p>
<p>has been the practice ever since. When he had administered the
</p>
<p>oath to the several witnesses, they were afterwards to be examined
</p>
<p>before the Grand Jury ; but this practice of administering- the oath in
</p>
<p>open Court, was found to be productive of some mischief and inconve-
</p>
<p>nience. It was found to produce a great deal of delay, accompanied
</p>
<p>by want of decorum, and was found, in fact, very injurious to the ad-
</p>
<p>ministration of justice. A number of the witnesses were sworn
</p>
<p>together, in a hurried manner, they were then sent ofl to the Grand
</p>
<p>Jury, and were examined by the Grand Jury, either immediately, or,
</p>
<p>perhaps, after a considerable interval, and it was felt not only to be
</p>
<p>indecorous in practice, but objectionable as separating the witness
</p>
<p>from the impression that he was giving his testimony under the
</p>
<p>sanction of an oath. That was one of the inconveniences to be
</p>
<p>provided for, for which the Statute 1 & 2 Vic. c. 37, was enacted.
</p>
<p>Wherever the Statute of 56 Geo. III. c. 87, was in operation this
</p>
<p>inconvenience was found to prevail. It prevailed as well at the Com-
</p>
<p>mission Court in Dublin as at the Assizes in the country; and ac-
</p>
<p>cordingly the Statute 1 & 2 Vic. recites the former Act in these
</p>
<p>words: " Whereas by an Act passed in the 56 Geo. III. entitled, " An
</p>
<p>" Act to regulate proceedings of Grand Juries in Ireland upon bills
</p>
<p>" of indictment, reciting that a practice had prevailed in many of the
</p>
<p>" Grand Juries in Ireland to find bills of indictment without exa-
</p>
<p>" mining witnesses for the Crown, &c, and whereas the provision
</p>
<p>'* for the vivd voce examination has been found most salutary ; but
</p>
<p>" the administration of the oath in Court has been productive of de-
</p>
<p>" lay and other inconveniences." It then proceeds to provide for
</p>
<p>and remedy this inconvenience, which was not confined to any parti-

</p>
<p>cular place or any particular Court, but was just as general as the
</p>
<p>provisions of the Statute under which it was enacted, and accordingly
</p>
<p>it proceeds thus : " For remedy whereof, that is, for the remedy of the
</p>
<p>inconvenience which prevailed as generally and extensively as the
</p>
<p>Act itself, " be it therefore enacted, &c, that in all cases where bills
</p>
<p>" of indictment are to be laid before Grand Juries in Ireland for their
</p>
<p>" consideration," that is, in all cases where the inconvenience pre-
</p>
<p>vailed, " the Clerk of the Crown at the Assizes and the Clerk of the
</p>
<p>" Peace at Quarter Sessions, or his or their deputy, shall endorse
</p>
<p>" upon the back of such bill of indictment the name or names of the
</p>
<p>" witness or witnesses for the Crown in support of such bill, and shall
</p>
<p>" send the same so endorsed to the Grand Jury." The Statute is in my
</p>
<p>mind defective, in not going further and mentioning other Clerks of the
</p>
<p>Peace and Clerks of the Crown, or in not using general terms to em-
</p>
<p>brace them all. It then goes on and says: " And the Foreman or
</p>
<p>95*
</p>
<p>" other member of the Grand Jury so empannelled, twelve members
</p>
<p>" of the said Grand Jury (at the least) being then present, shall, and lie
</p>
<p>" is hereby authorized and required so to do, previous to the exami-
</p>
<p>" nation of the witnesses whose names shall appear indorsed on the
</p>
<p>" back of the bill of indictment, administer to such witness the oath."
</p>
<p>This provision is universal ; it is general and not confined to any par-
</p>
<p>ticular Grand Jury. It says, " the Clerk of the Crown at the As-
</p>
<p>sizes, and the Clerk of the Peace at the Sessions;" that is, at the
</p>
<p>Assizes or Sessions at which the bills which they shall respectively
</p>
<p>prepare, shall be sent up according to their duty and the practice of
</p>
<p>indorsing the names of the witnesses to be examined ; and he shall,
</p>
<p>according to this provision, send them up to the Grand Jury. The
</p>
<p>omission to which I before adverted exists here; but the Statute
</p>
<p>enacts, " that the Foreman of the Jury so empannelled" not having
</p>
<p>alluded to any empannelling previously, but meaning that when the
</p>
<p>Grand Jury is empannelled the Foreman shall administer the oath
</p>
<p>to the witnesses whose names are endorsed on the bill ; which oath
</p>
<p>shall be in lieu of that formerly administered under the 56 Geo.
</p>
<p>III., to every witness; and upon every bill in every Court where
</p>
<p>the bill is prepared by the Clerk of the Crown or Clerk of the
</p>
<p>Peace;" and the Foreman and other member of the Grand Jury
</p>
<p>" who shall have administered such oath or affirmation shall, on the
</p>
<p>" back of such bill of indictment, &c. Provided always, that the
</p>
<p>" said oath or information shall not be in addition to, but in lieu of,
</p>
<p>" that heretofore administered in Court, &c. ; and provided also,
</p>
<p>" that the Foreman of the Grand Jury, or any other member thereof,
</p>
<p>" shall have power to administer such oath, &c, and to examine
</p>
<p>" any witness, &c, whose name shall not have been previously
</p>
<p>" endorsed on such bill of indictment by the Clerk of the Crown
</p>
<p>" or Clerk of the Peace respectively." That is, by the Clerk of
</p>
<p>the Crown or Clerk of the Peace whose duty it was; and whose
</p>
<p>duty it was equally in the Queen's Bench or Commission Court,
</p>
<p>as at the Assizes or Quarter Sessions. He was to prepare the
</p>

<p>Jury is not to administer the oath to any person but those whose
</p>
<p>names are sent up. That appears to me to be distinct and explicit.
</p>
<p>Under the 56 Geo. III. every Clerk of the Crown and Clerk of
</p>
<p>the Peace endorsed the names of the witnesses on the indictment.
</p>
<p>A difficulty has rather been suggested than argued, that no'authority
</p>
<p>was given to the Clerk of the Crown in the Queen's Bench to do this
</p>
<p>act. It was unnecessary that any authority should be given to him to
</p>
<p>do this by Act of Parliament. It is certain that no authority is given
</p>
<p>to the Clerk of the Crown in the Queen's Bench to do so ; but surely
</p>
<p>an Act of Parliament is not necessary to authorize the Clerk of the
</p>
<p>Crown to do his duty, which it is necessary that he should do in order
</p>
<p>to carry out the provisions of the Act of Parliament. It is not his
</p>
<p>endorsement, but the Act of Parliament, which gives authority to the
</p>
<p>Foreman of the Grand Jury to administer the oath, instead of that
</p>
<p>96*
</p>
<p>which was formerly administered in Court; and if there was a foun-
</p>
<p>dation for the argument that this authority should he given, it would
</p>
<p>seem to be impliedly given by the Act of Parliament. But what
</p>
<p>I rely on is, that it was his duty to do so, and no Act of Parliament
</p>
<p>was necessary to authorize him to do it. It is said that Grand Ju-
</p>
<p>ries in the Queen's Bench, and at the Commission Court, are not
</p>
<p>to be included within the general terms, " no Grand Jury in Ire-
</p>
<p>land," and that an amendment of this Act of Parliament is neces-
</p>
<p>sary. I do not consider at all that this is a penal Act of Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment. I am not resorting to any technical rule of construction. I
</p>
<p>am relying on the plain words of the Act of Parliament, which
</p>
<p>needs no forced assistance. Therefore, it does appear to me that
</p>
<p>this Statute does necessarily apply to every case of every bill sent
</p>
<p>Tip to a Grand Jury in Ireland. I do not at all concur in this ob-
</p>
<p>jection any more than I do in the argument on the other side,
</p>
<p>that the Queen's Bench is to be included in the meaning of the
</p>
<p>word "Assizes." I have no intention, in the construction of an
</p>
<p>Act of Parliament, to resort to such subtleties as that. Assizes
</p>
<p>means properly when the Judge goes on circuit, and it is meant so
</p>
<p>to be distinguished in many cases. Acts of Parliament were re-
</p>
<p>ferred to by counsel for the traversers, bearing out, and establish-
</p>
<p>ing this distinction ; and I recollect another case in which it was
</p>
<p>so ruled. In that case, the question arose as to whether there
</p>
<p>ought to be a ballot for a jury at JVisi Priiis at the sittings of this
</p>
<p>Court after Term, before the passing of the 3 & 4 Will. IV. ; and I
</p>
<p>recollect, on the argument, a Statute of Geo. II. being produced,
</p>
<p>which directed that jurors should be balloted for, elected, and
</p>
<p>sworn ; and I recollect there was a difficulty felt for some time,
</p>
<p>until the Clerk of the Crown suggested and pointed to the Court
</p>
<p>the word " Assizes," and the Court held that the Statute did not
</p>
<p>apply to the sittings at Nisi Priiis in Dublin. That was the case
</p>
<p>of Rex v. Cox.
</p>
<p>Then itis said, that the words " so empannelled" confine the enact-
</p>
<p>ment to jurors empannelled at the Assizes and Quarter Sessions. It

</p>
<p>is observable that the term " so empannelled" has no exact refe-
</p>
<p>rence to any thing that goes before, the word " empannelled" not
</p>
<p>being mentioned. But I think it may fairly and justly embrace and
</p>
<p>refer to the Grand Jurors previously mentioned, who are the Grand
</p>
<p>Jurors in Ireland " before whom bills of indictment may be laid,
</p>
<p>for their consideration," or, possibly, it might, as was argued so
</p>
<p>ably and ingeniously by the counsel for the traversers, refer to
</p>
<p>Grand Jurors at the Assizes and Quarter Sessions merely. But sup-
</p>
<p>posing a question to arise on this, and that we are to ascertain what
</p>
<p>it does refer to, whether we are to apply the confined meaning which
</p>
<p>the one side give the words, or the enlarged meaning which the
</p>
<p>other side have contended for, how are we to be guided in arriving
</p>
<p>at the truth in this respect ? The purpose of the Act points to all
</p>
<p>Grand Jurors which shall be empannelled, and that purpose will be
</p>
<p>defeated in a great number of instances, if the latter and confined
</p>
<p>97*
</p>
<p>reference should be adopted. Further, the express words of the
</p>
<p>Act  the express words of the very section  the express words of
</p>
<p>the very sentence on which the question arises, are : "in all cases
</p>
<p>" where bills of indictment are to be laid before the Grand Jury for
</p>
<p>" their consideration." If it was uncertain, when you referred to
</p>
<p>the commencement of the section, to what the words " so empan-
</p>
<p>nelled" referred, might not these words be held sufficiently to de-
</p>
<p>clare the intention to apply the remedy needed to all cases where
</p>
<p>the inconvenience existed, that is, to all cases where bills are laid
</p>
<p>before a Grand Jury in Ireland. I therefore think, that it would be
</p>
<p>a narrow and unwarrantable construction, to confine these words
</p>
<p>to a part only, instead of all the cases included and provided, or in-
</p>
<p>tended to be provided for by the Statute, in order to defeat a prin-
</p>
<p>ciple of great importance. Therefore, though I think the clause
</p>
<p>respecting and introducing the tei'ms "Clerk of the Crown at the
</p>
<p>Assizes," and " Clerk of the Peace at the Quarter Sessions," is inac-
</p>
<p>curate, and though it may be argued that the person who framed
</p>
<p>this Act did not advert to, or know whether there was any other
</p>
<p>tribunal than the Assizes and Quarter Sessions, still there are words
</p>
<p>in the Act of Parliament sufficiently large and distinct, to remove
</p>
<p>the difficulty and doubt which may arise. I think the enacting
</p>
<p>words do substantially and sufficiently provide, that in all cases
</p>
<p>where bills are to be laid before Grand Juries for their considera-
</p>
<p>tion, the Foreman or other member of the Grand Jury shall admi-
</p>
<p>nister the oath, which oath it substitutes for that before adminis-
</p>
<p>tered under the 56 Geo. III. c. 87, which was universal, but pro-
</p>
<p>vided that no witness should be examined, whose name was not en-
</p>
<p>dorsed by the Clerk of the Crown and the Clerk of the Peace,
</p>
<p>and this enactment appears to me to meet the mischief, and does
</p>
<p>not go beyond it, and remedies it. I therefore think there is
</p>
<p>no casus omissus, and I merely construe the Acts which are be-
</p>
<p>fore me. I apply their express meaning to the case at bar. I do
</p>
<p>not control that meaning, I do not extend it. I do not mean to le-
</p>
<p>gislate. I mean to give my opinion as to the meaning of these two

</p>
<p>Acts of Parliament. I do not think, therefore, that I am contra-
</p>
<p>vening any authority which has been cited, when I hold that since
</p>
<p>the 1 & 2 Vict. c. 39, in every case where bills are laid before Grand
</p>
<p>Juries in Ireland, the witnesses ought to be sworn by the Grand
</p>
<p>Jury, and not in open Court as before. I find that this construc-
</p>
<p>tion of the Statute at which I have arrived, after a careful and dili-
</p>
<p>gent and anxious consideration, in order to arrive at a just conclu-
</p>
<p>sion, has been, after judicial consideration, adopted by all the
</p>
<p>Judges : in the first instance, by that able and enlightened Judge,
</p>
<p>the late Chief Baron Wolfe, assisted by Mr. Justice Moore, at the
</p>
<p>next Commission after the passing of the Act ; by Chief Justice
</p>
<p>Doherty and Mr. Justice Johnson, when their attention was ex-
</p>
<p>pressly pointed to it afterwards. I find that it was adopted not only
</p>
<p>by them, but continued by every other Judge at the different Com-
</p>
<p>missions that have since been held, and it is material also to ob-
</p>
<p>serve, that it was not merely the opinion of the Judges, but also of
</p>
<p>o*
</p>
<p>98*
</p>
<p>the existing law officers of the Crown at the time, whose attention
</p>
<p>was distinctly drawn to it, and if there had heen any donbt enter-
</p>
<p>tained by the Judges on the subject, the matter would certainly have
</p>
<p>been remedied by an Act of Parliament framed to meet those doubts,
</p>
<p>I therefore feel myself strongly fortified by these judicial declara-
</p>
<p>tions.
</p>
<p>On these grounds, therefore, I am of opinion that the demur-
</p>
<p>rers ought to be allowed, and that these pleas are insufficient.
</p>
<p>With reference to the ground of special demurrer, it is not ne-
</p>
<p>cessary that I should, and I do not express any opinion upon it.
</p>
<p>But I cannot but observe, that if I was satisfied that the special de-
</p>
<p>murrer was well founded, it would go far to convince me that the
</p>
<p>rule which the Court made on a former day, refusing the names of
</p>
<p>the witnesses, was erroneous, and the argument on which it was
</p>
<p>founded unsafe. If I came to the conclusion that this plea is bad
</p>
<p>in point of form, it would certainly considerably shake my confi-
</p>
<p>dence in that decision.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General.  My Lords, I now apply that a judg-
</p>
<p>ment of respondeat ouster be entered against each of the traversers,
</p>
<p>and that they be called on to plead instanter. A similar order was
</p>
<p>made in the case of Rex v. Johnson, 6 East, 601. If parties de-
</p>
<p>cline to plead instanter, the Court should enter the plea for
</p>
<p>them according to the provisions of the 9 Geo. IV. c. 54, s. 8,
</p>
<p>whereby it is enacted. " that if any person arraigned upon, or
</p>
<p>" charged with any indictment for treason, felony, piracy, or mis-
</p>
<p>" demeanor, shall stand mute of malice, or will not answer directly
</p>
<p>" to the indictment or information, in every such case it shall be
</p>
<p>" lawful for the Court, if it shall so think fit, to order the proper
</p>
<p>" officer to enter a plea of not guilty on behalf of such person."
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell.  My Lords, I submit we are entitled to a rule to
</p>
<p>plead over in chief after a judgment of respondeat ouster. In the
</p>
<p>case of Rex v. Sheridan, 31 State Trials, 575, there was a consent
</p>
<p>entered into by the parties. In 1 Tidd, Pr. 641, it is said, the defen-
</p>
<p>dant, after judgment of respondeat ouster, has in general four days'

</p>
<p>time to plead ; but this is a matter in the discretion of the Court,
</p>
<p>and in criminal cases the Court has always felt bound to give the
</p>
<p>accused party the benefit of this four-day rule ; Rex v. JFilliams,
</p>
<p>Comber. 19 ; Tremain. P. C. 48; Rex v. Elliott, Cro. Car. 182 ; in
</p>
<p>that case a plea in abatement to the jurisdiction of the Court was put
</p>
<p>in, which was overruled, and afterwards divers rules were given
</p>
<p>them to plead.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside.  My Lords, I submit that the Statute 9 Geo.
</p>
<p>IV. c. 54, does not apply to this, as the provisions of it were com-
</p>
<p>plied with by our first plea. The case of Rex v. Elliott, Cro. Car.,
</p>
<p>and Rex v. JHUiams, Skinner, 217, show that a party charged with
</p>
<p>a misdemeanor had one rule to join in demurrer, and after judg-
</p>
<p>ment of respondeat ouster four days to answer. In the case in 6
</p>
<p>East, there was no argument. In misdemeanor cases the rule is
</p>
<p>99*
</p>
<p>analogous to that in civil cases, and then the party is always entitled
</p>
<p>to a four-day ride ; Bex v. Taylor, 3 B. & C. 512 ; Cantwellv.
</p>
<p>Stirling, I M. & Scott, 365 ; 2 Arch. Pr. 671 ; Duncan v. Carlton,
</p>
<p>2 B. &C. 799; 1 Sel. Pr. 275.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster replied.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  This appears to be an application
</p>
<p>to the discretion of the Court, and so it has been stated. Now what
</p>
<p>have we to influence that discretion. It was competent for the party
</p>
<p>to make a statement, that from particular circumstances, which lay
</p>
<p>upon him to bring forward, he was not able, and would not be
</p>
<p>prepared to put in a plea to the merits instanter. I do not blame
</p>
<p>the parties for putting in this plea in abatement. Again, he has
</p>
<p>been furnished with a copy of the indictment for fourteen days, and
</p>
<p>there is no statement that he is not aware of the subject matter of
</p>
<p>it. He has the power of pleading not guilty, or putting in a gene-
</p>
<p>ral demurrer, and he has not stated what course he will take. But,
</p>
<p>admitting this application is to the discretion of the Court, and that
</p>
<p>the party has no right to insist on it, he does not make any case
</p>
<p>from which we must assume that he can make none that 'could be
</p>
<p>addressed to the discretion of the Court ; it, therefore, appears in
</p>
<p>the nature of an application for the purpose of delay, and the Court
</p>
<p>cannot comply with it. And as he has made no case, there is no
</p>
<p>reason why justice should be delayed, and why the Attorney-Ge-
</p>
<p>neral should not have, as a matter of right, an answer to the indict-
</p>
<p>ment which has been preferred against the traversers, we are, there-
</p>
<p>fore, of opinion that the traversers must answer instanter.
</p>
<p>A plea of not guilty was then handed in on the part' of Daniel
</p>
<p>O'Connell, and the several other traversers.
</p>
<p>The Attorney -General.  The similiter to those pleas will be
</p>
<p>added in the office. He stated that notice would be served this day
</p>
<p>on each of the traversers, of his intention to apply for a trial at bar.
</p>
<p>FRIDAY, November 24th.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General moved that the trial of this cause should
</p>
<p>be a trial at bar, and that Monday, the 11th December, should be

</p>
<p>appointed for it to take place.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn, contra, applied that as the then jury list was impro-
</p>
<p>perly constituted, and not according to the terms of 3 & 4 Will. IV.
</p>
<p>c. 91, the trial should be postponed until the new jury panel should
</p>
<p>come into operation, as no fair trial could be had by the panel as at
</p>
<p>present constituted.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General having assented to the proposition,
</p>
<p>Monday, January 15th, was appointed for the trial to take place.
</p>
<p>100*
</p>
<p>SATURDAY, November 25th.
</p>
<p>Mr. (J Hay an (with whom was Mr. TFhiteside), on the part of
</p>
<p>Charles Gavan Duffy, applied that he be furnished with a list of the
</p>
<p>witnesses' names endorsed on the back of the indictment. This is
</p>
<p>a motion to the discretion of the Court upon special grounds. I
</p>
<p>move upon the affidavit of the attorney for the traversers, who states
</p>
<p>that he considers the names of those witnesses essential for the de-
</p>
<p>fence of his client; he also denies that this motion is brought for-
</p>
<p>ward for delay. A motion in some respects similar to this has been
</p>
<p>previously made, but that was an application that the copy of the
</p>
<p>indictment already furnished should be completed, by the addition
</p>
<p>of the witnesses' names, and on that motion it was contended that
</p>
<p>those names constituted part of the indictment, but the present is
</p>
<p>an application to the discretion of the Court on special grounds.
</p>
<p>The indictment, in this case, charges the traverser with a conspi-
</p>
<p>racy, which involves in it a great number of overt acts, and ex-
</p>
<p>tends over a long space of time, a period of nine months, and
</p>
<p>it is but reasonable that he should be afforded every means of de-
</p>
<p>fending himself. One of the great means in a case like the present,
</p>
<p>is that the accused should know who the witnesses are who will be
</p>
<p>produced against him, to enable him to judge of their character,
</p>
<p>and the source from which their information may have been ob-
</p>
<p>tained. Ninety-two meetings are alleged as overt acts of this con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, and the counsel for the Crown may rely on any one overt
</p>
<p>act, and the traverser will be obliged to be prepared with evidence
</p>
<p>to meet the charge. Under these circumstances, and looking to
</p>
<p>the legislative enactment upon the subject, I submit that this is an
</p>
<p>application which the Court in its discretion ought to grant. Under
</p>
<p>56 Geo. III. c. 87, the witnesses against the party were sworn in
</p>
<p>open Court, so the party had an opportunity then of knowing who
</p>
<p>woidd be produced against him as witnesses, but by 1 8c 2 Vict.
</p>
<p>c. 37, that practice has been altered, and the witnesses are, by that
</p>
<p>Statute, directed to be sworn before the Grand Jury, so that the
</p>
<p>party has no means of knowing who the witnesses are, and it there-

</p>
<p>fore has rendered the present application to the Court necessary. But
</p>
<p>it was never intended thereby to deprive the traverser of the advan-
</p>
<p>tage he had under 56 Geo. III., of knowing the witnesses against
</p>
<p>him. The 1 & 2 Vict, recites that inconvenience had occurred, in
</p>
<p>consequence of witnesses being sworn in open Court, but no incon-
</p>
<p>venience could occur from the accused party seeing who the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses were, and this being a remedial Statute, ought not to be con-
</p>
<p>strued so strictly as a penal Statute, and the party should not be
</p>
<p>thereby deprived of the benefit he before enjoyed. The principle
</p>
<p>of modern legislation is to afford the accused every just means of
</p>
<p>making his defence. By 6 &, 7 Will. IV. c. 114, after a recital to
</p>
<p>that effect, it is enacted that he is to be furnished with the copy of the
</p>
<p>informations sworn against him, and he thereby has a full know-
</p>
<p>ledge of the charge, and of the witnesses who will be produced
</p>
<p>against him. It is said that the practice in this country is against
</p>
<p>101*
</p>
<p>granting the names of the witnesses, but no practice can have any
</p>
<p>weight, as the Statute of Vict, has not existed for a length of time
</p>
<p>sufficient to establish any practice on the subject. There cannot be
</p>
<p>said to be any practice on the subject, for there is no trace of an ap-
</p>
<p>plication having ever been made. In England the practice has
</p>
<p>been uniformly to give the names. In Rex v. Gordon, -6 Jur. 996,
</p>
<p>which will be relied on by the Crown, from the affidavit to ground
</p>
<p>that application, it is clear, that the defendant knew who the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses were, and unless the practice were to grant those names the
</p>
<p>application would never have been made. We would not be able to
</p>
<p>call on the Crown to produce the witness whose name is endorsed on
</p>
<p>the indictment for the purpose of cross-examination, and this is a
</p>
<p>right which would be allowed the traverser in most cases, Regina
</p>
<p>v. Vincent, 9 Car. & P. 91 ; Regina v. Bull, ib. 22; Regina v.
</p>
<p>Holden, 8 Car. & P. 606; Regina v. Thursfield, id. 169. These
</p>
<p>cases also show that such is the practice in England, for unless the
</p>
<p>names had been furnished to the accused he could not have asked
</p>
<p>for their production. The King v. Parnell, I Wm. Blac. 36.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin. I think the practice in England is to have
</p>
<p>the witnesses sworn in open Court, because the 56 Geo. III. is a
</p>
<p>declaratory act, and was for the purpose of making the practice the
</p>
<p>same in both countries.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Hagan.  We have an affidavit by an eminent solicitor
</p>
<p>in England, stating that such has been the practice. Upon these
</p>
<p>grounds I submit that my client ought to be furnished with those
</p>
<p>names.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General (with whom was the Solicitor-General).
</p>
<p> The present application, which in substance is merely a rehearing
</p>
<p>of one which has been refused, is put upon two grounds; first, that
</p>
<p>the traverser is entitled to it is a matter of right, and secondly, that it
</p>
<p>is an application which the Court in its discretion ought to grant. As
</p>
<p>to the first point, this is an application of the first impression, and
</p>
<p>never before in this country has such an application been made. It is
</p>
<p>an application for a privilege which is not granted in high treason, the

<p>highest crime known to the law, Bac. Abr. Treason, C. C. It is said,
</p>
<p>that the advantage was had prior to the passing of the Stat. 1 & 2 Vict.,
</p>
<p>that although no practice had existed in Ireland, yet it was unneces-
</p>
<p>sary to make the application, because the witnesses were perfectly
</p>
<p>well known, being sworn in open Court. But it is well known to every
</p>
<p>person it would be impossible thereby to know who the witnesses
</p>
<p>were, as several hundred perhaps were sworn in a corner of the
</p>
<p>Court, in different cases, and it would be impossible to know in
</p>
<p>what particular case each of those were to be examined. There is
</p>
<p>no ground for the argument that they are deprived of a privilege, for
</p>
<p>this is a privilege which never existed. The case referred to in 2 Wm.
</p>
<p>Blac. only decides this, that copies of indictment are not public
</p>
<p>records, and that it is only under the 60 Geo. III. the party is en-

<p>titled to them, and in The King v. Holland, 4 T. R. 694. Buller, J.
</p>
<p>says, that it is only in civil cases the party is entitled to inspect the
</p>
<p>evidence. But it is said they cannot have the privilege of calling for
</p>
<p>102*
</p>
<p>the production of witnesses ; when the proper time arrives they may
</p>
<p>call for the production of them, hut because the party at the time of
</p>
<p>the trial may be entitled to that privilege, that is no authority to show
</p>
<p>his right to make the application at the present time. The affi-
</p>
<p>davit of the English solicitor is no authority to guide the Court, as
</p>
<p>he is not an officer of the Court ; but the case in 6 Jur. clearly
</p>
<p>shews that such has never been the practice in England. In that
</p>
<p>case Justice Patterson says, " I never heard of such an application
</p>
<p>" as this before, and yet circumstances of this nature must have
</p>
<p>" occurred before, and I do not find that any precedent has been
</p>
<p>" made or used to sustain the application."
</p>
<p>The Loud Chief Justice.  In this case the majority of the
</p>
<p>Court are of opinion that the present application ought not to be
</p>
<p>granted. The application is, that the Clerk of the Crown should
</p>
<p>furnish to the traversers a list of the names of the witnesses, ap-
</p>
<p>pearing on the record of the indictment which had been found
</p>
<p>against him. The present motion is properly distinguishable from
</p>
<p>the application, which, though similar in its nature, yet was in itself
</p>
<p>materially different, upon which the Court gave judgment some
</p>
<p>days since. I need hardly say that if there was not an essential
</p>
<p>difference, the discussion of the self-same subject would not be
</p>
<p>permitted by the Court a second time. It was brought forward on
</p>
<p>a former occasion on an application that the Clerk of the Crown
</p>
<p>should amend the copy of the indictment by inserting in it a list of
</p>
<p>the witnesses' names, that application was made as a matter of right,
</p>
<p>the parties having insisted that they had a right under the Statute
</p>
<p>to what they sought by their application. The Court decided that
</p>
<p>they were under a mistake, and that they had given a misconstruction
</p>
<p>to the Act of Parliament, when they considered that as a part of the
</p>
<p>indictment, which in fact was no part of it, and that, therefore, they
</p>
<p>were not entitled to it under the Statute on which they relied, and the
</p>
<p>Court saw no reason to entertain a doubt upon the propriety of the
</p>
<p>adjudication which was then made; I shall, therefore, pass it by,
</p>
<p>and come to consider the present question on its own grounds.

<p>I do not understand the present application as an assertion of a
</p>
<p>right which a party is entitled to demand, it has been argued on
</p>
<p>another ground, that although the party had not a right, yet he
</p>
<p>ought to be heard with success in an application to the discretion
</p>
<p>of the Court in order to enable him to prepare himself fully for his
</p>
<p>defence. Considering this then as an application to the discretion
</p>
<p>of the Court, I do not think that the party who makes this appli-
</p>
<p>cation has sustained his case so as to call into action the order of
</p>
<p>the Court regulated by its discretion. In the first place to call the
</p>
<p>Court into action, the traverser should make out a case to its satis-
</p>
<p>faction, that, without obtaining that which he applies for, he cannot
</p>
<p>effectually prepare his defence. I should observe in the first place
</p>
<p>that the traverser, on whose behalf the application is made, has
</p>
<p>made no affidavit, but his attorney has made an affidavit, in which,
</p>
<p>if I have not misunderstood it, he states in general terms that the
</p>
<p>obtaining the names of the witnesses was material for the prepara-
</p>
<p>103*
</p>
<p>tion of his defence. Now it is an odd thing, when we consider how
</p>
<p>often and how fully this question has heen in substance discussed,
</p>
<p>that to this hour there was no affidavit from the party or his at-
</p>
<p>torney that they did not know the names of the witnesses. He
</p>
<p>might have a perfect knowledge of those persons, yet the affidavit
</p>
<p>might be supposed to be substantially true, and this was a reason
</p>
<p>to be taken into consideration in influencing the discretion of the
</p>
<p>Court. Another consideration for the Court was, that though it
</p>
<p>stated generally that the names of the witnesses would be necessary,
</p>
<p>he does not attempt to show, that the furnishing of those names
</p>
<p>would be of any use whatever to the defence.
</p>
<p>The case has been argued, and properly argued, as addressed to
</p>
<p>the discretion of the Court, stating that according to the known
</p>
<p>rules and practice of the Court, the custom was to grant, in cases of
</p>
<p>misdemeanor, a copy of the names of the witnesses against the
</p>
<p>traversers ; but as far as my experience goes, or as far as I have
</p>
<p>heard, I have not heard stated a decision upon which the allegation
</p>
<p>could be founded, namely, that from the earliest times it has been
</p>
<p>the practice in misdemeanor cases to supply those names. So far
</p>
<p>as I know the law, or have heard the case argued, it has not been
</p>
<p>sustained by any Judge, or by the dictum of any text writer upon
</p>
<p>the subject; and in advancing this proposition, a mistake does
</p>
<p>exist on the part of the traversers' counsel. It was advanced as
</p>
<p>generally applicable to all cases. Now, though the principle, that
</p>
<p>it was desirable that parties should have every fair means afforded
</p>
<p>them for preparing their defence against the charge for which they
</p>
<p>were arraigned, was applicable to all cases, though this principle
</p>
<p>applies in all its length and extent to cases of felonies as well as
</p>
<p>misdemeanors, yet it was not attempted to he argued, that the rule
</p>
<p>applied to cases of felonies ; and I should say, considering the rule
</p>
<p>itself, that if there was a distinction to be taken, it should be ap-
</p>
<p>plied more favourably to those persons accused of the greater, than
</p>
<p>those accused of the lighter crimes ; but it is, and must be con-
</p>
<p>ceded, that no instance was ever known in the history of the law,

</p>
<p>of this being applicable to cases of felony ; but it is said it was
</p>
<p>applicable to the case of treason, and that in analogy to cases of
</p>
<p>treason, the rule ought to be extended to misdemeanors. I take
</p>
<p>that also not to be the law. If there was an analogy to be applied
</p>
<p>from treasons to misdemeanors, I should like to know on what
</p>
<p>principle it is, that it also could not be applied from treason to
</p>
<p>felony, and I repeat again, that it never was applied to felony, nor
</p>
<p>could it be argued that by law it ought to be so. But then, what
</p>
<p>is the law applicable to cases of treasons ? They were cases sui
</p>
<p>generis, and they should not be brought under the consideration
</p>
<p>of the Court, as governing cases of misdemeanors ; and though the
</p>
<p>law in its mercy has extended this privilege in cases of treason, in
</p>
<p>consideration of the penalty attached to this crime, it did not do so
</p>
<p>in the case of misdemeanors. But there is not the same principle
</p>
<p>referrible to felonies as to treason. As the law originally stood in
</p>
<p>cases of treason, the parties accused had no right to a copy of the
</p>
<p>104*
</p>
<p>witnesses' names, nor had they a right originally to a copy of the in-
</p>
<p>dictment ; but by the Statute of Treasons, it was enacted, that from
</p>
<p>thenceforward, the party indicted for treasons of a certain nature,
</p>
<p>involving the dignity of the Crown, should, in consideration of the
</p>
<p>dreadful penalty attached to the crime, be furnished with a copy of
</p>
<p>the indictment, but making a reservation at the same time, that he
</p>
<p>should not have a copy of the names of the witnesses ; and in no
</p>
<p>case up to that time, was the party accused, whether of treason,
</p>
<p>felony, or misdemeanor, entitled at common law to be furnished
</p>
<p>with a list of the names of the witnesses. There is in the Statute
</p>
<p>of Treasons, that which has been brought forward as showing an
</p>
<p>analogy which ought to govern the present case ; but there is also
</p>
<p>in that Statute, that which appears to me to afford a strong argu-
</p>
<p>ment the other way, for it is not merely silent with regard to
</p>
<p>furnishing a list of the witnesses, but it is expressly excluded
</p>
<p>from its operation. There are counteracting principles with re-
</p>
<p>gard to those which governed the common law, and those enacting
</p>
<p>an improvement on the common law. There were very cogent reasons
</p>
<p>stated, why the copy of the list of the witnesses' names should not
</p>
<p>be furnished to the accused, although he was entitled to get the
</p>
<p>indictment containing the charge and the informations upon which
</p>
<p>it was founded. Witnesses had been murdered, witnesses had been
</p>
<p>intimidated, witnesses had been bribed ; and by all those means
</p>
<p>the administration of justice had been frustrated and defeated,
</p>
<p>instead of being promoted, by furnishing the witnesses' names.
</p>
<p>Now that being the case, we are called on, without a reason which
</p>
<p>appears to us satisfactory, without an affidavit from the party (to
</p>
<p>which I have before referred as being to be looked for, and ex-
</p>
<p>pected in applications of this kind) to make, for the first time in this
</p>
<p>country, a new rule which would be applicable, not only to the pre-
</p>
<p>sent, but every other case of misdemeanor, that in every case without
</p>
<p>exception, the party accused should be furnished with a copy of the
</p>
<p>names of the witnesses. The Legislature has from time to time made
</p>
<p>enactments in addition to the common law in cases of misdemeanors,

</p>
<p>which the parties will be entitled to the benefit of as a matter of right.
</p>
<p>They were entitled to a copy of the indictment, to a copy of the ori-
</p>
<p>ginal informations sworn against them, on which they were held
</p>
<p>to bail ; and one might suppose that the Legislature conceived,
</p>
<p>that having got these privileges, which by the common law they
</p>
<p>were not entitled to, no reasonable ground was afforded why all
</p>
<p>persons accused of misdemeanors should be furnished in addition
</p>
<p>with the names of the witnesses who had sworn against them,
</p>
<p>whereby the safety and security of those witnesses might be com-
</p>
<p>promised, and thereby the attainment of justice defeated. Now it
</p>
<p>appears to me, when a party comes ex gratia before the Court,
</p>
<p>they should make out a satisfactory case, that it was absolutely
</p>
<p>necessary for them to have the names of the witnesses, for the non-
</p>
<p>furnishing of which I can suppose a very fair and good reason
</p>
<p>might be afforded, and they should confine themselves to the
</p>
<p>analogy of existing cases, where the law has made a provision that
</p>
<p>105*
</p>
<p>the names should be furnished. Now I go back to cases of high
</p>
<p>treason. By the Statute of Anne, provision was made that the
</p>
<p>names and additions of the jurors, and the names and additions of
</p>
<p>the witnesses, should be furnished to the prisoner within ten days
</p>
<p>before the trial. Is that a precedent to induce us, without a suffi-
</p>
<p>cient reason assigned, to make an order to furnish the names of the
</p>
<p>witnesses in a misdemeanor case, at a period of fifty or sixty days
</p>
<p>before the trial ? There is no corresponding precedent with regard
</p>
<p>to felony up to the present day, and although the party accused of
</p>
<p>felony might require to be furnished with the names of the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses against him, as much as a party accused of misdemeanor,
</p>
<p>yet the law affords him no such means of information. The officer
</p>
<p>of this Court upon a former occasion reported to us, that as to the
</p>
<p>practice of furnishing the names in cases of misdemeanor, it was
</p>
<p>never done in this country. But it may be said, that in this country
</p>
<p>there is no practice existing, and it was argued, that there could not
</p>
<p>exist a practice as to whether it was so or not, for these reasons,
</p>
<p>because the practice could not have sprung up from the 56 Geo.
</p>
<p>III. (1816), and only and for the first time the law had made a
</p>
<p>clear declaration, that witnesses who were to be examined before
</p>
<p>the Grand Jury were to be sworn in open Court; and that inas-
</p>
<p>much as the party accused had an opportunity of knowing who
</p>
<p>those persons were, he therefore did not require from that time to
</p>
<p>the passing of the 1 & 2 Vict, to be furnished with the names of
</p>
<p>the witnesses. It was said, that the accused had thereby gained a
</p>
<p>privilege they did not before possess, and that they were deprived
</p>
<p>of that privilege by the operation of the Statute 1 &.2 Vict., whereby
</p>
<p>it was enacted, that the swearing of witnesses in open Court should
</p>
<p>be discontinued, but that they should be sworn before the Grand
</p>
<p>Jury; therefore they argued, that between those periods, the 56
</p>
<p>Geo. III. and the 1 & 2 Vict, the accused did not want to be in-
</p>
<p>formed of the names of the witnesses against him, and that conse-
</p>
<p>quently it was not necessary to apply for that information. But
</p>
<p>supposing that privilege to be such as has been contended for,

</p>
<p>does it necessarily follow, that there was no room for the existence
</p>
<p>of such a practice before 1816? Up to that time the parties cer-
</p>
<p>tainly had not the means of being informed of the names of the
</p>
<p>witnesses, by seeing them sworn before them, because it is recited
</p>
<p>in the Act, that the bills used to be found without witnesses being
</p>
<p>examined in Court, and that therefore up to that time they had no
</p>
<p>means of being informed of the names, except by application at the
</p>
<p>Crown Office. Now if that be so, how does it happen, that up to
</p>
<p>1816, no person accused of misdemeanor ever made an application
</p>
<p>to be informed of the witnesses' names ? For this reason, because
</p>
<p>the law did not allow him to do so, and that was the foundation
</p>
<p>on which the officer was enabled to report, that no such practice
</p>
<p>existed in this country. At all events, if such a practice did exist,
</p>
<p>it did not lay any foundation, or show any reason why the present
</p>
<p>should be pushed beyond the case of high treason, where the names
</p>
<p>were only to be furnished ten clear days before the trial. That
</p>
<p>106*
</p>
<p>was also the foundation of the cases in 9 C. St P. and in 8 C. & P. ;
</p>
<p>they do not show the existence of such a rule as has heen insisted
</p>
<p>on, but they amount to this, that when the trial comes on, when
</p>
<p>there is no danger of intimidation or otherwise; if a case was made
</p>
<p>to the satisfaction of a Judge, not as an imperative rule of the
</p>
<p>Court, or of law, but that the attainment of justice required the
</p>
<p>presence of all the witnesses whose names were endorsed on the in-
</p>
<p>dictment; and the Judge being called on, and having the power to
</p>
<p>have the indictment laid before him, he would make the order as
</p>
<p>he did in those instances, that the absent witnesses should be
</p>
<p>called, in order to give the accused the power to cross-examine
</p>
<p>them ; but that is no precedent for the present application. If this
</p>
<p>were the day of trial, and that it was stated that witnesses' names
</p>
<p>who appeared on the bill, were not called for examination, it
</p>
<p>would be a matter within the power of the Court, and consistent
</p>
<p>with justice, to make the order, that those witnesses who were not
</p>
<p>brought forward should be produced, and no doubt such an order
</p>
<p>would be obtained. But that is not the present case, it is widely
</p>
<p>distinguishable from it. Then as to the practice as alleged to be
</p>
<p>proved in England. I at once say, that nothing is more unde-
</p>
<p>sirable, than that a different practice should exist in this country
</p>
<p>and in England ; but in support of what has been said of English
</p>
<p>practice, no case has been produced to show what that practice
</p>
<p>is, or upon what it is founded, not even the authority of text
</p>
<p>writers ; but a statement of the existence of such a practice was
</p>
<p>made, founded on a statement made by an English solicitor, not
</p>
<p>being an officer of the Court in England, who could certify such
</p>
<p>to be the practice. How could we know the extent of his expe-
</p>
<p>rience, or how far he is to be relied on? Why were not documents
</p>
<p>authenticated by the proper officer produced ? But in any event,
</p>
<p>the practice in England does not appear to have been brought
</p>
<p>under discussion in the Court in England ; and if driven to the ne-
</p>
<p>cessity of deciding which practice T should abide by, regretting as
</p>
<p>I should do, the existence of a practice in this country different

</p>
<p>from that in England, I should abide by it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Burton.  I concur fully in the judgment which
</p>
<p>has been given by my Lord Chief Justice, and in the reasons given
</p>
<p>by him. It is not necessary for me to go at length into the subject;
</p>
<p>but I concur in opinion that in this particular case, the rule applied
</p>
<p>for ought not at this time to be complied with. When the applica-
</p>
<p>tion was made which has been adverted to, and which was made in
</p>
<p>a different form, and in a different manner, and when I concurred in
</p>
<p>refusing it, I did not conclude myself from entertaining an applica-
</p>
<p>tion which was not precisely of the same description, but for the
</p>
<p>same purpose, that of obtaining a list of the witnesses examined by
</p>
<p>the Grand Jury. I did not then conclude myself from entertain-
</p>
<p>ing this application, when it should be made, without being
</p>
<p>governed or affected at all by the refusal to grant the former one.
</p>
<p>I am not sure that I expressed myself to that effect during the dis-
</p>
<p>cussion of that application, but certainly I did feel strongly that I
</p>
<p>107*
</p>
<p>did not intend to exclude myself from entering into the considera-
</p>
<p>tion of the question, whether the traversers had a right to the pro-
</p>
<p>duction of the names of the witnesses examined before the Grand
</p>
<p>Jury, either as a matter of right, or as a matter within the dis -
</p>
<p>cretion of the Court to grant or refuse. When the particular time
</p>
<p>should arrive for such an application, I considered myself entirely
</p>
<p>open to the discussion of the question. I confess when the applica-
</p>
<p>tion was first opened by the counsel for the traversers, and when it
</p>
<p>was supported by the arguments which were used in the first
</p>
<p>instance for its being complied with, I certainly did feel a wish,
</p>
<p>that the application might be one which upon the part of the
</p>
<p>Crown there might be sufficient reason for conceding, or at least,
</p>
<p>which there might be no reason for not conceding, because it is im-
</p>
<p>possible not to feel, that on an application made for the benefit of a
</p>
<p>person accused of any particular crime, whether of a private or of a
</p>
<p>public description, that he should have all reasonable means of de-
</p>
<p>fending himself, and I therefore did entertain a hope, that the appli-
</p>
<p>cation might be complied with on the part of the Crown, either ex-
</p>
<p>actly as it was made or subject to any terms which might be thought
</p>
<p>necessary to affix to it. However we are not now to consider the
</p>
<p>case in that light, we are to consider first, had the traverser a right
</p>
<p>in this instance de jure to be furnished with a list of the witnesses
</p>
<p>examined before the Grand Jury ; secondly, if he had not, was the
</p>
<p>request so reasonable a one that it ought to be complied with,
</p>
<p>and at this time. Now it strikes me that the application ought not
</p>
<p>to be granted as of right, for the reasons given by my Lord Chief
</p>
<p>Justice so fully and distinctly, and I will not take up the public
</p>
<p>time by adding any thing to what he has said, or even expressing
</p>
<p>the grounds on which I concur with him. They are grounds en-
</p>
<p>tirely in conformity with the reasons which he has given ; and I
</p>
<p>ought not perhaps to say more upon the subject. However there
</p>
<p>is one circumstance or ground of argument, that, if not directly
</p>
<p>asserted, and I do not mean to say that it has been, has been at least
</p>
<p>argued on, as if a principle of a particular kind which would not

</p>
<p>guide them, or at least ought not to govern the Court, yet should
</p>
<p>have a considerable effect on the Court in coming to a decision on
</p>
<p>the subject. I apprehend that it is no principle of the law of Ire-
</p>
<p>land or of England, that a person accused has a right previous
</p>
<p>to the trial, to any indication, statement, or exposition, from the
</p>
<p>prosecutor or the Crown, whether in a case of private or of a public
</p>
<p>prosecution, of the evidence against him. I apprehend there is no
</p>
<p>ground or suggestion for a principle of that kind, or that such a
</p>
<p>proposition, if made previous to the Act, was ever conceded.
</p>
<p>There is one instance of a case in which the prosecutor furnished a
</p>
<p>list of the witnesses, but I apprehend that case depended on a par-
</p>
<p>ticular Statute, the Statute of Treasons, and that it never existed
</p>
<p>under the 56 Geo. III. or 1 & 2 Vict., therefore it is not to be
</p>
<p>made the foundation in this case, that on the ground of public
</p>
<p>principle and justice, a man accused of any crime or misdemeanor
</p>
<p>is entitled from the Crown or the prosecutor ta a list of the wit-
</p>
<p>108*
</p>
<p>nesses. That has not been asserted, but the case been argued as it
</p>
<p>something of this kind ought to be conceded. But if this is not so,
</p>
<p>then the question must come entirely to be discussed upon the
</p>
<p>effect of the Statute which has been referred to, and certainly there
</p>
<p>is no provision in it that would warrant an application of this kind,
</p>
<p>at all events under these particular circumstances. The Statute in
</p>
<p>question has given a certain benefit to the party accused, that when
</p>
<p>a bill of indictment is sent to the Grand Jury, they should have the
</p>
<p>jurisdiction to examine the witnesses, and to see, before they find
</p>
<p>the bill, not only that the witnesses examined before them are de-
</p>
<p>serving of credit on other grounds, but also on this ground, that
</p>
<p>they are duly sworn, and have taken a solemn oath, and have put
</p>
<p>themselves under the sanction of a religious obligation to tell the
</p>
<p>truth. That has been done, and accordingly it is made essential,
</p>
<p>that the Grand Jury should have endorsed on the bill the names
</p>
<p>of the witnesses examined on oath before them. Jurisdiction is
</p>
<p>given them to do this, and it is only for that purpose that the Act
</p>
<p>was passed, for the purpose of giving the accused the advantage of
</p>
<p>having the bill of indictment endorsed with the names of the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses. If there were no other reason than this, it is very well
</p>
<p>worth consideration, that when witnesses are examined before the
</p>
<p>Grand Jury it is very reasonable, that first the Court should know,
</p>
<p>and very reasonable also that the party accused should know, par-
</p>
<p>ticularly when he is furnished with a copy of the indictment, what
</p>
<p>witnesses have already been examined against him. The statement
</p>
<p>of .those witnesses' names may have this effect, it may induce the
</p>
<p>prisoner not to call any witnesses as to a particular part of his de-
</p>
<p>fence, if certain witnesses are called for the prosecution, because the
</p>
<p>witnesses for the prosecution may be the persons to whom he him-
</p>
<p>self would appeal for the truth of the facts material for him to prove,
</p>
<p>it is reasonable, therefore, that he should have the advantage of
</p>
<p>seeing what witnesses are to be examined on the part of the prose-
</p>
<p>cution. It is on this ground, I think, that the decisions have been
</p>
<p>founded, that when the trial comes on, the party accused, if he desires

</p>
<p>it, can have all the witnesses produced, who were examined before
</p>
<p>the Grand Jury, and should not be put to the expense or incon-
</p>
<p>venience of summoning them or other witnesses, who may have an
</p>
<p>opportunity of proving the facts necessary for his defence, and
</p>
<p>therefore I certainly think it very reasonable, generally speaking,
</p>
<p>and on general grounds, and for such a purpose as that, unless some
</p>
<p>special reasons interfere, that the Judge should grant this applica-
</p>
<p>tion a reasonable time before the trial. So much I think is to be
</p>
<p>collected from the authorities referred to already on the subject,
</p>
<p>but I do not think that it has ever been, or now is a principle of
</p>
<p>the Crown law upon the subject in question, that the party is at
</p>
<p>any time to be acquainted with the particular evidence as given
</p>
<p>before the Grand Jury, and therefore, it is only for the purpose
</p>
<p>mentioned, or some similar or analogous purpose to it, that it is
</p>
<p>conceded as a reasonable thing. So far we may safely go ; but the
</p>
<p>proposition contended for is this, that at any time after bills have
</p>
<p>109*
</p>
<p>been found, the parties accused are entitled to the list. Now upon
</p>
<p>that I perfectly concur in the reasons that my Lord Chief Justice
</p>
<p>has laid before the Court, and although, as I collect, he admits it to
</p>
<p>be very reasonable, that for a reasonable purpose, the Judge should
</p>
<p>grant a list to the traversers, yet it is not the necessary consequence
</p>
<p>that on the indictment being found and on the endorsement of the
</p>
<p>witnesses' names being made on the bill, the party accused should
</p>
<p>be entitled to a list of those names at the same moment that he is
</p>
<p>entitled to a copy of the indictment. I do not think that any such
</p>
<p>proposition has been established, and I think that the reasons sug-
</p>
<p>gested by my Lord on the subject, at all events, are sufficient to
</p>
<p>induce one to see, that there may be great inconveniences, and not
</p>
<p>only inconveniences, but impediments to the administration of jus-
</p>
<p>tice, if the proposition was carried to this extent. Such a proposi-
</p>
<p>tion never came under the consideration of a Court of Justice, and
</p>
<p>I do not think was ever established. If any practice existed, I take
</p>
<p>it to have been founded on general grounds, and, generally speaking,
</p>
<p>perhaps there may be no reason for not furnishing a list of the
</p>
<p>witnesses at the time the indictment was found, but there are parti-
</p>
<p>cular reasons, or may be particular reasons or inconveniences
</p>
<p>affecting the administration of justice, to restrain that practice
</p>
<p>within certain limits, and admitting such a list ought to be furnished
</p>
<p>before the trial, under proper and sufficient circumstances, does it
</p>
<p>therefore become a right of the subject to have it at all times and
</p>
<p>in all cases. I do not think that has been established. The first
</p>
<p>impression on my mind was certainly, that there could be no reason-
</p>
<p>able objection to this application, however, from the nature of the
</p>
<p>crime itself, from the peculiar circumstances attending it in many
</p>
<p>points of view, it may be attended with consequences dangerous and
</p>
<p>detrimental to the administration of justice, to grant the application
</p>
<p>which has been made at this moment. I think, therefore, the Court
</p>
<p>ought not to comply with the application at this time, whatever may
</p>
<p>be done on a future occasion.

<p>myself warranted in doing more than express my concurrence in
</p>
<p>the opinion of my Lord Chief Justice, were it not that one of my
</p>
<p>learned brothers differs from the rest of the Court. This is an ap-
</p>
<p>plication which is certainly of very considerable importance. It is
</p>
<p>an application by the traversers to an indictment for a misdemeanor,
</p>
<p>for an order upon the prosecutor, to furnish them with a list of the
</p>
<p>names of the witnesses endorsed on the back of the bill sent up to the
</p>
<p>Grand Jury, and it is made at a period of seven weeks before the day
</p>
<p>fixed for the trial. This application must be founded either on the
</p>
<p>right of traversers, and it has not been so urged by their counsel,'
</p>
<p>or it must be founded on grounds upon which the discretion of the
</p>
<p>Court should be called into exercise to grant this privilege to the
</p>
<p>traversers. I say nothing with regard to the former motion having
</p>
<p>been substantially the same as this, because if I found that, in point
</p>
<p>of right, the traversers were entitled to such an order, or that they
</p>
<p>had such a case as called for the exercise of the discretion of the
</p>
<p>110*
</p>
<p>Court, I should not certainly, in a case of such importance, on the
</p>
<p>last day of term, wish that they should be deprived of their right
</p>
<p>on a mere matter of form. But this application must be founded
</p>
<p>either on a right, or on some ground calling for the exercise of the
</p>
<p>Court's discretion. Now what is the right on which the traversers
</p>
<p>are entitled to this list? It cannot be because it is part of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment. That was the motion which was refused, and I think was
</p>
<p>correctly refused on a former occasion. Though in a popular sense,
</p>
<p>sometimes, the names of the witnesses may be said to form part of
</p>
<p>the indictment, in point of law they are no part of it. It cannot,
</p>
<p>therefore, be under the Statute that the application is made. But it
</p>
<p>is said, or rather suggested, that the traversers have a right to the
</p>
<p>witnesses' names at common law. They have been unable to find
</p>
<p>any authority for that position, neither principle nor adjudged case.
</p>
<p>I find nothing applicable to this case in the case of treasons. The
</p>
<p>parties accused of treason are entitled to a list of the witnesses'
</p>
<p>names by the Statute. In cases of felonies to this day, the party
</p>
<p>accused is not entitled to a copy of the indictment. In misde-
</p>
<p>meanors it is said he is. He was not so by the common law, I
</p>
<p>know that he is now considered as entitled to it, and has been in
</p>
<p>cases of misdemeanor so considered to be entitled for a considera-
</p>
<p>ble time. It has been said, that this right grew out of the favour
</p>
<p>of the Court. That position perhaps might be made out ; but, how-
</p>
<p>ever it may be, the traverser has a right to a copy of the indictment.
</p>
<p>But having that right, he has no right either by statute law or by
</p>
<p>common law, to a copy of the names of the witnesses endorsed on
</p>
<p>the indictment, unless it is as part of it, and that view has been
</p>
<p>rejected by the Court. The case has been put on another ground,
</p>
<p>namely, that it was the practice at common law to give the names
</p>
<p>of the witnesses. Where is that practice ? The traversers now call
</p>
<p>on the Court to make an order of this kind for the first time. In
</p>
<p>this country such an order was never made. To be sure it was never ap-
</p>
<p>plied for, but we are now called on to change the order and practice of
</p>
<p>proceedings in this country, on what is termed the English practice.

<p>I do not admit that such has been the established practice inEngland ;
</p>
<p>I pay no attention, either to the certificate, or affidavit, which have
</p>
<p>been produced. The testimony of no gentleman, either in England
</p>
<p>or Ireland, however respectable or eminent he may be in his pro-
</p>
<p>fession, ought to be a voucher for the practice of a Court of common
</p>
<p>law. The practice is to be collected from some higher authority,
</p>
<p>otherwise we can pay no attention to it. However, if I was satis-
</p>
<p>fied that the practice was so in England, it would make no change
</p>
<p>in my opinion in this particular case, sitting as I do here in the
</p>
<p>Court of Queen's Bench of Ireland. If I was satisfied that it was
</p>
<p>the practice in England to give a list of the witnesses' names to
</p>
<p>traversers in cases of misdemeanor, should I think that the traver-
</p>
<p>sers in this case ought therefore to get a list of the witnesses ? No.
</p>
<p>It may be the practice to give a list of the names of the witnesses
</p>
<p>along with the indictment. It is otherwise here. If any such
</p>
<p>practice there be in England, it may be a practice merely official,
</p>
<p>Ill*
</p>
<p>which has never heen brought hefore the attention of the Courts in
</p>
<p>England, with regard to which no adjudged case can he found.
</p>
<p>But although it he conceded, for the purposes of this discussion,
</p>
<p>to he English practice, is it therefore to govern the practice here '?
</p>
<p>If there be such a practice, it is probahle that it grew out of the
</p>
<p>habit of the Clerk of the Crown giving the names with a copy of
</p>
<p>the indictment. The case seems to have heen that. But what is
</p>
<p>the practice in Ireland ? The experience of the officer, and our
</p>
<p>own experience, is, that such a practice never existed in Ireland.
</p>
<p>But then it is said, there is no practice at all in Ireland, and therefore
</p>
<p>we ought to be governed hy the practice in England. The practice
</p>
<p>of the Court is the law of the Court, and of the country. But the
</p>
<p>practice of the Courts of law in England and here, do not always
</p>
<p>conform. In some instances their practice is better, in other
</p>
<p>instances our's is better ; and I concur in the desire, that the prac-
</p>
<p>tice of both countries should be assimilated as far as possible.
</p>
<p>However we must act on the practice as we find it. It is said, that
</p>
<p>there is no practice here, and therefore that we should take up the
</p>
<p>English practice. That seems to me to be a misstatement. It has
</p>
<p>been the practice at the Assizes here, to grant copies of indictments
</p>
<p>in misdemeanor cases, since the passing of the 56 Geo. III. c. 87,
</p>
<p>and the 1 & 2 Vict. c. 37 ; but never since the introduction of the
</p>
<p>wholesome practice of examining the witnesses before the Grand
</p>
<p>Jury, has a copy of their names been given, either with or without
</p>
<p>the indictment. Before the 56 Geo. III., there were no witnesses
</p>
<p>examined before the Grand Jury, and therefore no names were en-
</p>
<p>dorsed. After the 56 Geo. III., we can conceive a new practice to
</p>
<p>have arisen, to find no bill of indictment without the examination
</p>
<p>of witnesses. Twenty-five years have since elapsed, and no appli-
</p>
<p>cation has been made to have the names of the witnesses examined;
</p>
<p>I do not know whether it was the practice to endorse the names on
</p>
<p>the bill after the passing of the 56 Geo. III. or not; if it was, it
</p>
<p>furnished the party with an opportunity to make the application.
</p>
<p>The 1 &2 Vict., which has at all events established that practice, is

<p>a Statute of a late date, but since it passed, it never occurred to any
</p>
<p>body, in a case before the Court, at the Assizes, to call for a list of
</p>
<p>the witnesses ; no traverser, therefore, before the passing of the 56
</p>
<p>Geo. III. or under that Statute, or since the passing of the 1 &. 2
</p>
<p>Vict., has ever made this application as a matter of right. I, there-
</p>
<p>fore, think, as a matter of right, it is impossible to entertain this ap-
</p>
<p>plication. But another ground has been put, that it is an applica-
</p>
<p>tion to the discretion of the Court. I certainly think, in common
</p>
<p>with my Lord Chief Justice, that if a sufficient ground was stated
</p>
<p>by affidavit, calling on the Court at a proper time, for a list of the
</p>
<p>witnesses, I should be disposed to grant such an order. But what
</p>
<p>are the grounds of the present application ? First, that the party is
</p>
<p>ignorant of the names of the witnesses, and, therefore, he is pre-
</p>
<p>judiced thereby. Am I at liberty to assume here, that the traverser
</p>
<p>did not know those names, when I find that on a former occasion
</p>
<p>an application was made to the Court to have the names furnished
</p>
<p>112*
</p>
<p>on a different ground from the present one ; and that neither any of
</p>
<p>the traversers, nor any of the respectable gentlemen concerned for
</p>
<p>them, have stated on oath, that they did not know the names of the
</p>
<p>witnesses; they may not have been known to them in a legal way,
</p>
<p>but every person must be aware, that in practice, the names do
</p>
<p>transpire. If the party was ignorant of the names, and thought
</p>
<p>that he would be prejudiced by not having a list of the witnesses,
</p>
<p>why did he not disclose the fact of his ignorance by the affidavit of
</p>
<p>himself or his agent, and show why he wanted the names of the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses, and the application would then have been made to the discre-
</p>
<p>tion of the Court. Is this abond fide application to enable the party
</p>
<p>to make his defence at this important time'? That is the question.
</p>
<p>If it is so, it ought to have been stated. It may be so, but that is not
</p>
<p>disclosed by the affidavit. What use is to be made of this list? Can
</p>
<p>we be satisfied that some use may not be made of it, which is not
</p>
<p>bond fide beneficial to the defence of the traversers, but on the con-
</p>
<p>trary, prejudicial to a fair trial? I am making no imputations on
</p>
<p>the traversers. 1 am speaking merely of the affidavits, which are in
</p>
<p>this respect quite defective and insufficient to support the applica-
</p>
<p>tion. Another matter has been observed on by the Chief Justice,
</p>
<p>which is not without weight, I mean the time at which the applica-
</p>
<p>tion is made. Seven weeks before the trial. According to the
</p>
<p>English practice, it is at the trial or shortly before it, that the pro-
</p>
<p>secutor or the Clerk of the Crown is called on to give this informa-
</p>
<p>tion to the party. But according to the principle contended for
</p>
<p>here, the moment the indictment is found, that instant the party is
</p>
<p>entitled to the names of the witnesses. If the names of the witnesses
</p>
<p>be part of the indictment he is, but if not, he is not. If they be not
</p>
<p>part of the indictment, as the decision of this Court has asserted, on
</p>
<p>legal principles he must make the application to the discretion of
</p>
<p>the Court. Has he a right to have that discretion exercised seven
</p>
<p>weeks before the trial? The trial has been postponed by consent,
</p>
<p>and that long period has been given to enable the parties to prepare
</p>
<p>for their defence. There is abundant time for defence and inquiry

</p>
<p>of every description. But possibly the parties may want the names
</p>
<p>not for that purpose, which I think is the only purpose for which
</p>
<p>they ought to be furnished with them. Therefore I say, it is a
</p>
<p>motion without precedent in this country, without a single adjudged
</p>
<p>case to warrant it. Such a motion, if granted in this particular case,
</p>
<p>on the grounds before the Court, might form a dangerous precedent.
</p>
<p>If granted on this occasion, it could not be refused at a Special
</p>
<p>Commission, or at the Assizes. It is impossible to foresee the
</p>
<p>dangers and inconveniences which might not arise from the intro-
</p>
<p>duction of such a rule before those Courts. I think it safer, espe-
</p>
<p>cially in criminal cases, to stand by the established practice, than to
</p>
<p>introduce, in a case like the present, where there are no special
</p>
<p>grounds for the exercise of the discretion of the Court, at such a
</p>
<p>period of time, contrary to the usual course of proceedings, a rule
</p>
<p>which might involve consequences of such danger to the adminis-
</p>
<p>tration of justice. My opinion, therefore, is clear, that on the
</p>
<p>113*
</p>
<p>present grounds, and at the present time, the applieation ought to be
</p>
<p>refused.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin.  Notwithstanding all that I have heard at
</p>
<p>the Bar and from my Lord Chief Justice and my learned brethren of the
</p>
<p>Bench, I am still under the disadvantage of differing from the rest of
</p>
<p>the Court. I cannot see any good reason to refuse this application,
</p>
<p>and not to give the names of the witnesses endorsed on the indict-
</p>
<p>ment as they are now sought for. This application is perfectly dis-
</p>
<p>tinct from that on which the former order of the Court was made.
</p>
<p>The motion on that occasion was to amend the copy of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment which had been furnished to the traversers, and it was, in my
</p>
<p>judgment, properly refused, on the ground that the names endorsed
</p>
<p>on the indictment form no part of it. This is an application made on
</p>
<p>the affidavit of the attorney, the gentleman who is employed to ar-
</p>
<p>range and prepare the defence, of one of the traversers, and he swears
</p>
<p>that he requires a list of the witnesses' names as essential to, and for
</p>
<p>the purpose of enabling the traverser to defend himself effectually.
</p>
<p>I think there can be no doubt that it may be, and generally is very
</p>
<p>important to a man's defence, as well to know who his accusers are,
</p>
<p>as what the extent of the charge is, and the Statute which has been
</p>
<p>referred to, the 6 & 7 Will. IV. c. 114, altering the state of the law
</p>
<p>in an essential particular, proves this to be a sound principle, and also,
</p>
<p>in my mind, furnishes a complete answer to a good many of the argu-
</p>
<p>ments which have been urged against this application. The defence
</p>
<p>may depend much on the veracity and character of the witnesses who
</p>
<p>are to be produced on the part of the Crown. That may furnish
</p>
<p>an important ground of defence for the consideration of the traver-
</p>
<p>sers and those engaged for them, and as my brother Burton has ob-
</p>
<p>served, it may be very material for the traverser, or the prisoner,
</p>
<p>to know, that certain witnesses will be produced on whose testi-
</p>
<p>mony he may be enabled to rest part of his case. There is
</p>
<p>another distinct reason for giving him the names of the witnesses,
</p>
<p>It may be important for him to know this, with a view to avoid the
</p>
<p>necessity of looking for other witnesses to support his case in that

</p>
<p>respect. It is not necessary for me to go through the cases or in-
</p>
<p>stances in which it may be, or in which it may not be, essential to
</p>
<p>the traverser to know the names of the witnesses to be produced
</p>
<p>against him, because the person who makes the affidavit in this case
</p>
<p>is, above all other persons, qualified to form an opinion, and he has
</p>
<p>distinctly sworn that it is, according to his belief, essential to the
</p>
<p>defence of the traverser that he should be apprised of the names of
</p>
<p>the witnesses. I was surprized to hear it asserted that he did not
</p>
<p>swear that the names were not known. I cannot conceive how any
</p>
<p>gentleman of recpectability or veracity could swear that it is essential
</p>
<p>to his client to be furnished with the names of the witnesses, if he
</p>
<p>was conscious at the time that his client knew them. I think this
</p>
<p>affidavit necessarily involves, in every well-constituted mind, a distinct
</p>
<p>denial that he does not know the names. Because, if he does, it is
</p>
<p>in my mind not only an evasion, but direct false swearing. I per-
</p>
<p>ceive no sound objection to this disclosure ; nor have I heard any
</p>
<p>Q*
</p>
<p>114*
</p>
<p>argument which has satisfied me that it is desirable that the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses' names should in general be suppressed. No special objection
</p>
<p>has been suggested at the bar in this particular case. I wish to be
</p>
<p>as brief as possible at this late hour on the last day of term. I before
</p>
<p>adverted to the 6 & 7 Will. [V. c. 114; it does not show to me any ob-
</p>
<p>jection nor any inconvenience that would arise from furnishing the
</p>
<p>names of the witnesses sought. By that Statute the party accused
</p>
<p>is entitled to the names and depositions of all the witnesses sworn
</p>
<p>before he was held to bail or committed. 1 can see no inconvenience,
</p>
<p>but a distinct reason for giving him the names of the witnesses upon
</p>
<p>the indictment, for the purpose of informing him whether he is
</p>
<p>to make his defence against the depositions alone, or whether
</p>
<p>any additional proof has been given before the Grand Jury. It
</p>
<p>appears to me, therefore, that there is no sound objection in ge-
</p>
<p>neral to such a course of proceeding. It has been stated that the
</p>
<p>first Monday in next term having been fixed for the trial yester-
</p>
<p>day, the traversers have abundant time to prepare for their defence,
</p>
<p>and that this application comes too soon. It appears to me that this
</p>
<p>is the exact time when the application should be made, if the parties
</p>
<p>believe it essential to their defence. It could not be made between
</p>
<p>this and next term. It is not a motion which could be made in Cham-
</p>
<p>ber, unless some particular circumstances arising after term were re-
</p>
<p>lied on.
</p>
<p>It is said there is no practice in this country to give a list of the
</p>
<p>witnesses; or that the practice is the other way. I cannot find any
</p>
<p>instance in which the names of the witnesses were ever refused ;
</p>
<p>and, if they were never refused, it follows that there was no necessity
</p>
<p>for making the application. So that, with respect to that observation,
</p>
<p>it may be taken that there is in this country no fixed or settled
</p>
<p>practice on the subject. But it does appear to me, on the best consi-
</p>
<p>deration that I can give to the documents which have been laid before
</p>
<p>us, supported, as I think they are, by the case to which the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General referred, Rex v. Gordon, that the practice in England is to
</p>
<p>give the names of the witnesses endorsed on the indictment in cases

</p>
<p>of misdemeanor. I think it is impossible to doubt that such is the
</p>
<p>practice there, especially as it is not suggested on the other side that
</p>
<p>the practice is otherwise. We have been furnished, in the course of
</p>
<p>the argument, with a variety of information on the subject which is
</p>
<p>not to be found in books ; and, therefore, I must take it that, if this
</p>
<p>application was made at Westminster Hall, it would be granted. I
</p>
<p>consider then, without saying that the practice of a Court in England
</p>
<p>is to govern the practice of this Court, that in a case of this descrip-
</p>
<p>tion, where there is no settled practice, it would be convenient to
</p>
<p>adopt that which prevails in England. I think it has been very fairly
</p>
<p>insisted, that nothing inconsistent with or obstructive to the adminis-
</p>
<p>tration of justice would ensue from complying with that practice. The
</p>
<p>common law of England is the common law of Ireland, where the lat-
</p>
<p>ter is not altered by Statute ; and I think that should be relied on
</p>
<p>rather than any unascertained and unpublished practice here. Be-
</p>
<p>fore the 56 Geo. III. the practice in Ireland was to have bills found
</p>
<p>without examining witnesses  on the informations alone. That was
</p>
<p>115*
</p>
<p>contrary to the practice in England, as well as to the common law of
</p>
<p>both countries. This practice it was endeavoured to sustain by sug-
</p>
<p>gesting difficulties which were likely to follow an alteration of it. It
</p>
<p>was suggested that such an alteration would be fraught with dangers
</p>
<p>and difficulties to the witnesses, some of which were specified, and
</p>
<p>some were not. But after great deliberation, the Legislature perse-
</p>
<p>vered in passing the 56 Geo. III. ; and the practice was altered, and
</p>
<p>the common law was declared ; and it was also enacted, that the
</p>
<p>names of the witnesses should be endorsed on the bill.
</p>
<p>I have adverted to the principal grounds on which I have come to
</p>
<p>this conclusion. There are other observations which I should have
</p>
<p>wished to make, and which, but for the lateness of the hour, on this
</p>
<p>the last day of term, I should feel myself bound to make in a case
</p>
<p>where I am under the disadvantage of differing from the rest of the
</p>
<p>Court. My opinion is, that this application ought to be granted.
</p>
<p>Mr. Smyly.  My Lords, in this case 1 have to apply for a Special
</p>
<p>Jury.

<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  You may take the order.
</p>
<p>HILARY TERM.
</p>
<p>FRIDAY, January 12th, 1844.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore, with whom was Mr. Whiteside, applied on the part
</p>
<p>of the traversers, that the panel of special jurors, for the year 1844,
</p>
<p>should be quashed and set aside, or that a mandamus, or an order
</p>
<p>in the nature of a mandamus, should be issued, directed to the Re-
</p>
<p>corder, commanding him to place on the list of jurors, for the year
</p>
<p>1844, the names of twenty-seven persons whose qualifications had
</p>
<p>been proved before, and allowed by the Recorder to be special jurors
</p>
<p>of the city of Dublin ; and that upon the said Jury List being rectified
</p>
<p>according to the truth and fact, and the adjudication of the Recorder,
</p>
<p>it be delivered to the Clerk of the Peace for the county of the city of
</p>
<p>Dublin, and that he be ordered to strike a special jury to try the case,
</p>
<p>pursuant to the order of the 25th of November, 1843 ; and that in the
</p>
<p>mean time the trial should be postponed or specially fixed for the 1st
</p>
<p>of February. They moved, on the affidavit of the attorney for the

<p>traversers, which stated that the names of several persons whose qua-
</p>
<p>lifications had been allowed by the Recorder, had, by fraud or mistake,
</p>
<p>been omitted from the Jurors' List from which the jury had been struck.
</p>
<p>They contended that the Court had jurisdiction under the 3&4 Will.
</p>
<p>IV. c. 91, to allow the motion, and that it was a proper case for the
</p>
<p>exercise of that jurisdiction, and relied on Recjina v. Mayor of Eye,
</p>
<p>9 Ad. & El. 670 ; Rex v. Severn Railway Company, 2 Barn. & Al.
</p>
<p>746.
</p>
<p>The Attorney -General (with whom was the Solicitor -General).
</p>
<p> The Crown is ignorant of the cause of this mistake. If any has
</p>
<p>taken place, it is the fault of the Clerk of the Peace or his deputy,
</p>
<p>and there is a special provision in the 36th section of the Act, by
</p>
<p>116*
</p>
<p>which he may be punished. Unless the traversers can impute cor-
</p>
<p>ruption to the Crown, or some persons employed by them, the Court
</p>
<p>should not permit the trial to be postponed. There is no appeal from
</p>
<p>the decision of the Recorder, and therefore the Court has no juris-
</p>
<p>diction ; Regina v. Conrahy, 2 Cr. & Dix, C. C. 56.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  The Court is of opinion that this
</p>
<p>application cannot be granted. We all concur in that view of the
</p>
<p>subject. The disclaimer that has been introduced against imputing
</p>
<p>any act of criminality to any person whatsoever, is somewhat remark-
</p>
<p>able. A great deal has been said as to the impropriety which has been
</p>
<p>committed ; a great deal has been said to show that the persons to whom
</p>
<p>that impropriety may by possibility be imputed, are within the juris-
</p>
<p>diction of the Court. 1 could very well understand, if the facts at all
</p>
<p>warranted it, that an application might have been brought forward which
</p>
<p>would have called for the attention, and investigation, and interposition
</p>
<p>of the Court ; but this very grave charge is made against no individual.
</p>
<p>That the charge is not made, does not proceed from want of conside-
</p>
<p>ration nor from ignorance of the subject. The parties have not brought
</p>
<p>forward the case we might have expected them to do. This has been
</p>
<p>the subject matter of investigation, both public and private, for a great
</p>
<p>length of time. An affidavit has now been made by the attorneys for the
</p>
<p>traversers. They have tried the assistance of counsel, but they have
</p>
<p>made no tangible charge against any person whatsoever. Mr. Mahony
</p>
<p>goes the length of stating, that corruption had taken place somewhere.
</p>
<p>What is the Court to do with an affidavit of this kind ? What is the
</p>
<p>order the Court is now called on to pronounce ? An order for a man-
</p>
<p>damus to quash the general Jury Panel of the county of the city of
</p>
<p>Dublin, after all these proceedings have been taken. Every person
</p>
<p>who may be a suitor during the present year is perfectly satisfied
</p>
<p>that his rights are secure in the persons who have been selected, and
</p>
<p>is interested in upholding it as it at present stands. There must be
</p>
<p>a strong, convincing, and peculiar case to induce the court to make
</p>
<p>this alteration which is sought for, and to set aside that which the
</p>
<p>public are now interested in. Then with regard to the mandamus

</p>
<p>No regular notice has been served upon the Recorder, of this appli-
</p>
<p>cation against him, or on the Clerk of the Peace, nor is the present
</p>
<p>application grounded upon any tangible charge. I do not say that
</p>
<p>a case of corruption might not be made out, which would give the
</p>
<p>Court jurisdiction, authority, ami right to interfere, but here no
</p>
<p>specific case has been made, on the contrary it has been disclaimed.
</p>
<p>The only case made is, that Mr. Mahony took upon himself to say
</p>
<p>that he believed corruption existed somewhere. Though the Act is
</p>
<p>very long, and a great deal of pains appear to have been taken in
</p>
<p>settling the proceedings, it seems to have been studiously the inten-
</p>
<p>tion of it, that unless corruption was proved, the proceedings before
</p>
<p>the Recorder were to be conclusive. The Recorder is intrusted with
</p>
<p>the revision of the lists, originating with the parish officers in the
</p>
<p>first instance, and to be investigated by him, and he is to pronounce
</p>
<p>his judgment, and to make out a list, which, when transmitted to
</p>
<p>the Clerk of the Peace, is to be handed to the Sheriff as the Jurors'
</p>
<p>117*
</p>
<p>Book out of which the Sheriff is to form his special jury list. But
</p>
<p>when once the document has left the Recorder's office, he has no
</p>
<p>further power over it. Therefore, there would be another objection
</p>
<p>to this application, because it proceeds upon the ground that he would
</p>
<p>have power of correcting- the lists. He has no such power. That
</p>
<p>Act of Parliament has not provided for that case. The Recorder has
</p>
<p>no power to recall the list for the purpose of re-investigation. On
</p>
<p>these grounds, I think, the application is against reason and against
</p>
<p>principle, and ought to be refused.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin.  I concur in the rule which has been
</p>
<p>pronounced ; but I cannot help saying that it is a matter of great
</p>
<p>suspicion and of great negligence. It is going far to assume that it
</p>
<p>was a mere accident ; however, it is clear that this Court has no
</p>
<p>power to reform the Jury List, especially without notice to the parties
</p>
<p>concerned. The proper course of proceeding is by a prosecution
</p>
<p>against the party for his misconduct ; but there is no ground for the
</p>
<p>interference of the Court summarily, as there is no misconduct
</p>
<p>charged against any specified person. On these grounds I concur
</p>
<p>with the judgment of the Court.
</p>
<p>SATURDAY, January 13th.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General moved, that in the event of the trial not
</p>
<p>terminating before the 31st of January, the 1st of February, and
</p>
<p>every succeeding day, until the 15th of April, or so many as might
</p>
<p>be fixed for the trial of the case, should be deemed and taken for the
</p>
<p>purpose of the said trial, as part of the Hilary Term, 1844, by virtue
</p>
<p>of the Statute 1 & 2 Will. IV. c. 31 , s. 3.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  The Court has directed a trial at
</p>
<p>bar and has fixed the day. Will those days not then of course be
</p>
<p>part of the term without any order of the Court for that purpose.
</p>
<p>However, there being no opposition, the Court, though they may
</p>
<p>think it unnecessary, will grant your motion.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin.  I think it would be a dangerous prece-
</p>
<p>dent to make an order in contemplation that a trial by jury will last
</p>
<p>more than sixteen days. I do not think that the Act of Parliament

</p>
<p>meant to go to the extent to which the order you seek for goes.
</p>
<p>The motion was granted.
</p>
<p>MONDAY, January 15th, 1844.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown having called over the traversers' names,
</p>
<p>they all appeared at the bar, with the exception of the Rev. Peter
</p>
<p>James Tyrrell, who had died in the interval since the last Term.
</p>
<p>He then called over the jury panel, several of whom were excused
</p>
<p>from attendance, in consequence of ill-health. A sufficient number
</p>
<p>having however appeared, Sir Colman 0' Loghlen, on behalf of
</p>
<p>Daniel O'Connell, handed in a challenge to the array, which was as
</p>
<p>follows :

<p>118*
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>" And now on this day, to wit, on the 15th day of January,

<p>" comes the said Daniel O'Connel, in his proper person, and the
</p>
<p>" jurors empannelled, and so forth, also come, and thereupon the said
</p>
<p>" Daniel O'Connell challenges the array of the said panel, because
</p>
<p>" he says that at the special sessions heretofore holden in and for the
</p>
<p>" county of the city of Dublin, to wit on the 14th of November
</p>
<p>" last past, to wit at Dublin, in the county of the city aforesaid, be-
</p>
<p>" fore the Right Hon. Frederick Shaw, Recorder of the said city
</p>
<p>" of Dublin, for the purpose of examining a list of jurors of the said
</p>
<p>" county of the city of Dublin, for the now current year, to wit the
</p>
<p>" year 1844, pursuant to the statuable enactments in such case made
</p>
<p>" and provided, the Clerk of the Peace in and for the said county
</p>
<p>" of the city of Dublin duly laid before the said Recorder divers, to
</p>
<p>" wit twenty lists theretofore duly furnished to the said Clerk of the
</p>
<p>" Peace by the several collectors of grand jury cess within the said
</p>
<p>" city in that behalf duly authorized to make such lists containing or
</p>
<p>" purporting to contain a true list of every man residing within their
</p>
<p>" respective districts of collection who were qualified and liable to
</p>
<p>" serve as jurors, pursuant to the Statutes in such case made and
</p>
<p>" provided, with the Christian and surname of each written at full
</p>
<p>" length, and with the true place of abode, title, quality, calling, or
</p>
<p>" business, and the nature of the qualification of every such man, in
</p>
<p>" their proper columns, pursuant to the statutable enactments in such
</p>
<p>" case made and provided. And the said Daniel O'Connell further
</p>
<p>" says, that the said several lists respectively were by the said Re-
</p>
<p>" corder at the said special sessions duly corrected, allowed, and
</p>
<p>" signed by the said Recorder, pursuant to the statutable enactments
</p>
<p>" in such case made and provided, and that the several persons whose
</p>
<p>" names are hereinafter mentioned, were then and there adjudged by
</p>
<p>" the said Recorder to have the qualification hereinafter named, and
</p>
<p>" that the names of the said several persons were then and there
</p>
<p>" contained in the said several lists so corrected, allowed, and signed
</p>
<p>" as aforesaid, but the said Daniel O'Connell says that the said Re-

</p>
<p>" to be made out from said several last mentioned lists one general
</p>
<p>" list containing the names of all the persons whose qualification had
</p>
<p>" been so allowed, arranged according to tank and property, nor did
</p>
<p>" the said Recorder thereupon at all deliver such general lists con-
</p>
<p>" taining such names to the Clerk of the Peace, to be fairly copied
</p>
<p>" by the said Clerk of the Peace in the same order as by said sta-
</p>
<p>" tutable enactments is directed, but on the contrary thereof ne-
</p>
<p>" glected so to do: and the said Daniel O'Connell further says, that
</p>
<p>44 a certain paper writing purporting to be a general list, purporting
</p>
<p>" to be made out from such several lists so corrected, allowed, and
</p>
<p>" signed as aforesaid, was illegally and fraudulently made out by some
</p>
<p>" person or persons unknown, and the said Daniel O'Connell says,
</p>
<p>" that the said list purporting to be such general list, does not contain
</p>
<p>" the names of all the persons whose qualifications have been allowed
</p>
<p>" upon the correcting, allowing, and signing of said lists as afore-
</p>
<p>" said by the Recorder, but omitted the names of divers, to wit sixty
</p>
<p>119*
</p>
<p>" persons whose qualifications respectively to be on said list had been
</p>
<p>" so allowed as aforesaid by the said Recorder, which said several
</p>
<p>" persons whose names have been omitted are as follow [here fol-
</p>
<p>" low sixty names inserted in the challenge.] And the said Daniel
</p>
<p>" O'Connell further says, that the said several persons whose names
</p>
<p>" were so omitted from the said fraudulent paper writing, purporting
</p>
<p>" to be the general list as aforesaid, were, at the time of the return of
</p>
<p>" said collectors' lists, and at the time of the said special sessions,
</p>
<p>" and still are, severally resident within the county of the said city

<p>" of Dublin, and were at the said several times, and now are, duly
</p>
<p>" qualified to be, and should and ought to have been placed upon the
</p>
<p>" said general list; and the said Daniel O'Connell further says, that
</p>
<p>" from the said fraudulent paper writing, purporting to besuchgene-

</p>
<p>" Book of the said county of the city of Dublin for the current calen-

<p>" saith, that the said fraudulent omission of the said several per-

</p>
<p>TheA ttorney - General. My Lords, a3 the indictment is joint, I
</p>
<p>think the proper course will be to enter a suggestion on the record
</p>
<p>of the death of the Rev. Peter James Tyrrell. The officer should take
</p>
<p>it down now, and he can afterwards enter it formally on the record.
</p>
<p>The several challenges were then handed in on the part of the
</p>
<p>the traversers.
</p>
<p>Sir Colman O'Loghlen stated that there was some difference be-
</p>
<p>tween the challenges just handed in, and that of Mr. O'Connell ; in
</p>
<p>one averment, in stating, in addition to the allegation, that the paper
</p>
<p>writing, purporting to be a general list, was illegally and fraudulently
</p>
<p>made out, they added, that it was so made out for the purpose and
</p>
<p>with the intent to prejudice the said traversers in the cause.
</p>
<p>A demurrer was then handed in by the Crown, and the traversers
</p>
<p>joined in demurrer.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General.  My Lords, on the part of the Crown, I
</p>
<p>demur to this challenge. The 3 & 4 Will. IV. c. 91, sec. 4, provides,
</p>
<p>that " for the assistance of the Sheriff in framing the Jurors' Book,
</p>
<p>" the Clerk of the Peace in every county, &c. shall, within one week
</p>
<p>" after the commencement in every year of the Midsummer Sessions,
</p>
<p>" issue and deliver his precept in the form set forth in the schedule
</p>
<p>" hereunto annexed (or as near thereto as may be), to the High Con-
</p>
<p>" stable and collectors of grand jury cess in each barony, or other dis-
</p>
<p>" trict of collection, and to the collectors of other cess or assessment
</p>
<p>" wherein grand jury cess is levied, requiring such collectors respec-
</p>
<p>" tively to prepare and make out, within one month then next ensu-
</p>
<p>" in-, a true list of all men residing within their respective districts,
</p>
<p>" quali6ed with respect to property, and liable to serve on juries,
</p>
<p>" according to the Act as aforesaid, and also to perform and comply
</p>
<p>" with all other the requisitions in the said precept contained." The
</p>
<p>25th section provides for the mode in which the officer is to strike
</p>
<p>a special jury, when an order for it has been obtained. The con-
</p>
<p>trary not being averred in the challenge, it must be taken for
</p>
<p>granted that the special jury was properly made out by the Sheriff,
</p>

<p>there is nothing on the face of the challenge to show that the High
</p>
<p>Sheriff has not done his duty, therefore he must be assumed to have
</p>
<p>complied with the section of the Statute in every particular. We
</p>
<p>must then go back to the 9th section, to ascertain the manner in
</p>
<p>which the Jurors' Book, from which the Sheriff is to take the special
</p>
<p>jury, is made out. By the challenge, it is endeavoured to be esta-
</p>
<p>blished, by facts appearing on the face of it, that the Jurors' Book for
</p>
<p>1844 is null and void. The early part of the 9th section provides
</p>
<p>for the return of the list by the High Constable to the Recorder,
</p>
<p>and for the mode in which the collectors' lists are to be corrected by
</p>
<p>the Justices at the sessions, or by the Recorder ; and then enacts:
</p>
<p>" and when every such list shall be duly corrected by the Justices
</p>
<p>" present at such special sessions, or adjournment thereof, and allowed
</p>
<p>" and signed by them, or three of them, they the said Justices shall cause
</p>
<p>" one general list to be made out therefrom, arranged according to
</p>
<p>" rank and property; and the presiding Justices at such sessions shall
</p>
<p>25
</p>
<p>" deliver the same to the Clerk of the Peace, who shall thereupon
</p>
<p>" cause the same to be truly and fairly copied in the same order, in a
</p>
<p>" book to be by him provided for that purpose, and which book shall
</p>
<p>" be called the Jurors" Book for the year." Under this section, there-
</p>
<p>fore, the Recorder in Dublin having corrected and allowed the col-
</p>
<p>lectors' or parish list, is to cause a general list to be made out there-
</p>
<p>from, containing the names of all persons whose qualifications have
</p>
<p>been allowed, arranged according to rank and property, and to deliver
</p>
<p>it to the Clerk of the Peace, on whom the duty is imposed by the
</p>
<p>statute to make out the Jurors' Book from the general list, and to
</p>
<p>deliver it to the High Sheriff. It is a settled principle of law, that
</p>
<p>public officers are presumed prima facie to do their duty ; and there-
</p>
<p>fore, in the absence of a distinct averment in the challenge of non-
</p>
<p>performance of these specific duties, the inference of law is, that
</p>
<p>they were performed ; Williams v. East India Co., 3 East, 192 ;
</p>
<p>The performance of their duty by the respective officers is not nega-
</p>
<p>tived by the challenge, and must therefore be presumed to have
</p>
<p>taken place. There is no averment that the Recorder did not
</p>
<p>deliver the general list to the Clerk of the Peace. The averment
</p>
<p>in the challenge is a negative pregnant, which establishes this affir-
</p>
<p>mative, that a general list had been delivered to the Clerk of the
</p>
<p>Peace. It is not negatived that a general list of some description
</p>
<p>was delivered to the Clerk of the Peace, and therefore I am entitled
</p>
<p>to assume that there was ; nor that the Jurors' Book was made out
</p>
<p>from that list ; nor that the Clerk of the Peace did not hand over
</p>
<p>the Jurors' Book to the High Sheriff. It is not controverted in the
</p>
<p>challenge, that the High Sheriff made up the list of jurors regularly
</p>
<p>from the Jurors' Book of 1844. All this not being controverted by
</p>
<p>the challenge, is in point of law admitted. The challenge runs thus :
</p>
<p>" But the said Daniel O'Connell says, that the said Recorder did
</p>
<p>" not, as by statutable enactments is directed, cause to be made out
</p>
<p>'<from the said several last-mentioned lists, one general list, containing
</p>
<p>" the names of all the persons whose qualifications had been so allowed,
</p>
<p>" arranged, &c. ; nor did the said Recorder thereupon, or at all,

</p>
<p>"deliver such names to the Clerk of the Peace, to be fairly copied by
</p>
<p>" said Clerk of the Peace, in the same order as by said statutable en-
</p>
<p>actments is directed." This averment is nothing more than this,
</p>
<p>that the Recorder did not deliver to the Clerk of the Peace, a
</p>
<p>general list, containing the names of all persons, arranged according
</p>
<p>to rank and property, on the parish list, and that would be proved
</p>
<p>not only by the omission of a single name, but by the transposition
</p>
<p>of a peer's son for a baronet. By that kind of ingenious special
</p>
<p>pleading, the Court is to infer, that no general list was made out,
</p>
<p>contrary to its own judicial knowledge. It is not even negatived
</p>
<p>that a list, purporting to be a general list, was delivered to the Clerk
</p>
<p>of the Peace. Thus, if a person in the employment of the Recorder
</p>
<p>was to omit or transpose a single name, the whole of the Jurors' Book
</p>
<p>for the county would be nullified. The challenge then states : " and
</p>
<p>" the said Daniel O'Connell further says, that a certain paper wri-
</p>
<p>" ting, purporting to be a general list made out from such several
</p>
<p>E
</p>
<p>26
</p>
<p>" lists so corrected, allowed and signed, as aforesaid, was illegally and
</p>
<p>" fraudulently, and for the purpose and with the intent to prejudice
</p>
<p>"the said Daniel O'Connell in the cause, made out by some person
</p>
<p>" or persons unknown : and the said Daniel O'Connell says that the
</p>
<p>" said list, purporting to be the general list, does not contain the names
</p>
<p>" of all the persons whose qualifications have been allowed, &c., by the
</p>
<p>"said Recorder, but omitted thenames of divers, to wit, sixty persons,
</p>
<p>" &c." It then goes on to state the names of those persons : " and
</p>
<p>' the said Daniel O'Connell further says, that from the said fraudulent
</p>
<p>"paper writing, purporting to be such general list as aforesaid, a cer-
</p>
<p>tain book, purporting to be the Jurors' Book of the said county of the
</p>
<p>" city of Dublin, for the current calendar year, to wit, for the year 1844,
</p>
<p>" was made up." By this pretence the Jurors' Book (which purports to
</p>
<p>be among the records of the Court, not simply in the case of the Queen
</p>
<p>v. O'Connell, but in every other case) handed to the High Sheriff
</p>
<p>by the officer properly authorized, is to be nullified, because some
</p>
<p>unknown person, whom nobody can suggest the name of, might have
</p>
<p>or did, for a fraudulent purpose, erase or omit certain names, in doing
</p>
<p>the duty imposed on him by the Recorder. Under these circum-
</p>
<p>stances, it must be contended on the other side, that every jury for
</p>
<p>the year 1844 in Dublin, is to be struck from the Jurors' Book of
</p>
<p>1843; for, by the provisions of the Act, if there is no book for 1844,
</p>
<p>the Sheriff must go back to the book for the former year. The
</p>
<p>alteration, whether intended so or not, has the effect of prejudicing
</p>
<p>the Crown, by delaying the trial. What I submit to your Lordships
</p>
<p>is this : there is no averment at all stating that the Recorder did not
</p>
<p>hand a general list to the Clerk of the Peace, the law therefore
</p>
<p>presumes that he did. There is no averment that the Clerk of the
</p>
<p>Peace did not make out the Jurors' Book from a general list. There
</p>
<p>is no averment that a Jurors' Book for 1844 was not made out by the
</p>
<p>Clerk of the Peace; no averment that the Sheriff did not make out
</p>
<p>a special jury list, containing 717 names; no averment that the jury
</p>
<p>was not properly struck. It is therefore to be presumed that these
</p>
<p>things were done. There is no averment of fraud or contrivance on

</p>
<p>the part of the Crown, the High Sheriff, the Recorder, or the Clerk
</p>
<p>of the Peace. The Jurors' Book is a final record, that on which the
</p>
<p>Sheriff is to act. That is clearly decided by the case of Regina v.
</p>
<p>Conrahy, 1 Cr. & Dix, C. C. 56, and Regina v. Fitzpalrick, 1 Cr.
</p>
<p>& Dix, 522; and that an irregularity in the book did not justify a
</p>
<p>challenge to the array. The enactment has been decided by Chief
</p>
<p>Justice Doherty and Judge Torrens to be merely directory. My
</p>
<p>Lords, it is not stated in the challenge, that the act done by some
</p>
<p>person unknown, was to the prejudice of Mr. O'Connell, although it
</p>
<p>is so stated in the other challenges. It would be endangering the
</p>
<p>proceedings in every court of justice, if your Lordships were to put
</p>
<p>it in the power of any individual, by an alteration in the general list of
</p>
<p>jurors, to nullify the proceedings of the Court If this unknown person,
</p>
<p>whoever he may be, can be discovered, I shall be happy to take any
</p>
<p>proceedings against him. It would be very desirable that justice
</p>
<p>should be brought home to him, whoever he mav be; and I am sure
</p>
<p>27
</p>
<p>that the Crown is as strongly interested as those engaged on the part
</p>
<p>of the prosecution ; but I cannot consent to or allow a challenge of
</p>
<p>this kind, without taking the distinct opinion and decision of the
</p>
<p>Court upon it. It would be productive of the greatest mischief to
</p>
<p>nullify the Jurors' Book for 1844; in point of law there is no ground
</p>
<p>for treating it as null and void. I may observe, that in England, ac-
</p>
<p>cording to the case of the King v. Edmonds and others, 4 B. & Aid.
</p>
<p>471, there can be no challenge to the array in a special jury case.
</p>
<p>For these reasons I trust the Court will be of opinion that the de-
</p>
<p>murrer to the several challenges should be allowed, and the trial per-
</p>
<p>mitted to proceed.
</p>
<p>Sir Colman O'Loghlen.  My Lords, I am counsel for the tra-
</p>
<p>verser, Daniel O'Connell. I do not understand the learned Attorney
</p>
<p>General to rely on his last observation as to the right to challenge to
</p>
<p>the array to a special jury.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General.  I certainly do, and I cited Rex v.
</p>
<p>Edmonds with that view.
</p>
<p>Sir C. O'Loghlen.  It is laid down in Dickenson's Quarter Ses-
</p>
<p>sio)is, by Sergeant Talfourd, p. 501, note, that a challenge to the
</p>
<p>array of a special jury does lie. The same position is laid down in
</p>
<p>Hayes' Crim. Law, 443, and in Bacon's Abridg. Jury. D. Rex v.
</p>
<p>Brumage, 3 Wils. 439 ; Rex v. Johnson, 2 Str. 1000 : and in
</p>
<p>Andrews, 85, 104 ; Rex v. Nolan, 1 Huds. & Br. 164. With
</p>
<p>regard to the effect of this challenge the Attorney General has
</p>
<p>stated, first, that there is no averment that the Recorder did not
</p>
<p>make up the general list ; and secondly, that there is no averment that
</p>
<p>he did not hand over to the Clerk of the Peace the general list, and
</p>
<p>that the Clerk of the Peace did not make out the Jurors' Book for
</p>
<p>1844. Now, these facts are averred as distinctly as they possibly
</p>
<p>could be. The challenge, after referring to the correction of the list
</p>
<p>before the Recorder, goes on to state: " And the said Daniel O'Con-
</p>
<p>" nell further says, that the said several lists respectively were by the
</p>
<p>"said Recorder at the said special sessions duly corrected, allowed, and
</p>
<p>" signed, by the said Recorder pursuant to the statute, &c. ; that the

</p>
<p>" several persons whose names are hereinafter mentioned, were then
</p>
<p>" and there adjudged by the Recorder to have the qualification here-
</p>
<p>" inafter named, and that the names of the said several persons were
</p>
<p>"then and there contained in the said several lists so corrected,, al-
</p>
<p>" lowed, and signed, as aforesaid; but the said Daniel O'Connell says,
</p>
<p>" that the said Recorder did not, as by said statutable enactments is
</p>
<p>" directed, cause to be made out from said several last-mentioned lists,
</p>
<p>" one general list containing the names of all the persons whose quali-
</p>
<p>" fications had been so allowed, arranged according to rank and pro-
</p>
<p>" perty; nor did the said Hecorder thereupon at all deliver such general
</p>
<p>" list containing such names to the Clerk of the Peace to be fairly copied
</p>
<p>" by the said Clerk of the Peace in the same order as by said statutable
</p>
<p>"enactments is directed, but on the contrary neglected so to do." With
</p>
<p>regard to the word " all," if issue was joined on the fact, and if it was
</p>
<p>shown that one name was omitted, it would be sufficient. The words
</p>
<p>of the Statute, sec. 9, are : " They the said Justices shall cause one ge-
</p>
<p>28
</p>
<p>"nerallist tobe made out therefrom, containing the names ofaWpersons
</p>
<p>"whose qualification shall have been so allowed." It is specifically averred
</p>
<p>in the challenge that the Recorder did not cause the list to be made
</p>
<p>out, and that he did not deliver it to the Clerk of the Peace. We then
</p>
<p>go on: " and the said Daniel O'Connell further says, that a certain paper
</p>
<p>" writing purporting to be a general list purporting to be made out from
</p>
<p>"such several lists so corrected, allowed, and signed, as aforesaid, was
</p>
<p>" illegally and fraudulently made out." The Attorney General did
</p>
<p>not dare to join issue on that point. By demurring to the chal-
</p>
<p>lenge he has admitted the truth of the averment that the general
</p>
<p>list was illegally and fraudulently made out. I will now show you
</p>
<p>that the Jurors' Book, from which the special jury in this case was
</p>
<p>struck, was made out from this list, so illegally and fraudulently con-
</p>
<p>cocted. My Lords, the next averment is this: [counsel here read the
</p>
<p>remainder of the challenge']. Thus we have taken all the facts step
</p>
<p>by step. We have averred in precise language that no general list
</p>
<p>was caused to be made out by the Recorder ; secondly, that no such
</p>
<p>list was delivered to the Clerk of the Peace by the Recorder;
</p>
<p>thirdly, that a fraudulent book was concocted, from which this special
</p>
<p>ury was taken. The present panel is therefore fraudulently taken
</p>
<p>from a list concocted by some person whom we do not know. The
</p>
<p>Crown might have joined issue on these facts. The Attorney Ge-
</p>
<p>neral said there was no averment that this was to the prejudice of
</p>
<p>Daniel O'Connell. The word "fraudulently" would include that, but
</p>
<p>besides, the challenge concludes " to the wrong and injury of the said
</p>
<p>Daniel O'Connell." The fact being admitted upon this demurrer
</p>
<p>that there was a fraudulent list concocted, that the Jury Book was
</p>
<p>made up from a fraudulent list, and the special jury was taken from
</p>
<p>the Jurors' Book, the next question is, what is the effect of that,
</p>
<p>and is it a ground for challenging the array ?
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice  I do not know whether you are
</p>
<p>not putting the matter further than the pleading warrants, in using the
</p>
<p>word " concocted."
</p>
<p>Sir Caiman O'Lcghlen.  I mean "made out." The principle con-

</p>
<p>tended for by us is, that the general list was fraudulently made out.
</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that if the Sheriff acted fraudulently, and if he
</p>
<p>was to omit the names, it would be a ground of challenge. At the
</p>
<p>Maryborough Special Commission, page 259, in Munday's Report,
</p>
<p>Chief Justice Bushe says: " Your duty is to try, whether this is an
</p>
<p>" impartial panel, or has it been so constructed as to deprive the pri-
</p>
<p>"soners of a fair trial. If persons have been left off that panel, or
</p>
<p>" corruptly placed, or postponed in such a manner and to such an ex-
</p>
<p>" tent, as would deprive the prisoners of impartial jurors, or throw
</p>
<p>" them into the power of jurors prejudiced against them, then this is
</p>
<p>" not an impartial panel, and you will find accordingly ; but if otherwise,
</p>
<p>" there is no pretence for this challenge." That case establishes that
</p>
<p>fraud in the Sheriff is good ground for a challenge to the array. No
</p>
<p>fraud is now imputed to the Sheriff, our allegation is, that fraud was
</p>
<p>committed before it came to the Sheriff's hands ; and I ask, is there a
</p>
<p>substantial distinction between the caseswhere fraud has been com-
</p>
<p>29
</p>
<p>nutted by the Sheriff, and where it has heen committed before it came
</p>
<p>to his hands. The Attorney General stated that the Statute points
</p>
<p>out a remedy by imposing a penalty on the person who acts cor-
</p>
<p>ruptly. What remedy would that be in a case of life and death ?
</p>
<p>The 36th section gives the same remedy against the Clerk of
</p>
<p>the Peace, and all subordinate officers, and against the Sheriff;
</p>
<p>yet fraud in the Sheriff is a good cause for a challenge to the array.
</p>
<p>Therefore, if a subordinate officer acts fraudulently, it is a good cause
</p>
<p>of challenge. The Attorney General referred to one or two cases,
</p>
<p>Regina v. Conrahy, and Regina v. Fitzpatrick. In the first case
</p>
<p>Judge Torrens decided that the Statute was merely directory. There
</p>
<p>is no analogy between that and the present case. There it was merely
</p>
<p>alleged that the form had not been complied with, but no fraud was
</p>
<p>alleged of any kind. In the other case, Chief Justice Doherty over-
</p>
<p>ruled the challenge pro forma, and reserved the point for the twelve
</p>
<p>Judges. It did not become necessary to decide the question, for the
</p>
<p>prisoner was acquitted. Those cases, therefore, are merely blind cases,
</p>
<p>and have nothing to do with the present case. The Attorney General
</p>
<p>stated that a formidable principle would be decided if the challenge was
</p>
<p>allowed; the formidable principle is the other way. It would lead to
</p>
<p>this, that provided the Sheriff does not act corruptly, if every other
</p>
<p>officer acts corruptly, the party has no remedy whatever. If there
</p>
<p>is no precedent, it is because the question never has arisen before.
</p>
<p>[Mr. Justice Burton.  How is the fraud alleged in this case ?] The
</p>
<p>allegation is, that the list was illegally and fraudulently made out, by
</p>
<p>some person or persons unknown, and that fact is admitted by the
</p>
<p>demurrer. So the case stands thus ; no general list was made out
</p>
<p>by the Recorder, as directed by the Statute; no such list was delivered
</p>
<p>by the Clerk of the Peace ; but a fraudulent list was made out by a
</p>
<p>person unknown, and from that the Jurors' Book and the special jury
</p>
<p>panel were taken. Notice was given of this to the Crown Solicitor,
</p>
<p>and the question is now, whether that is sufficient to set aside the
</p>
<p>whole panel. In point of law it is. The only substantial objection
</p>
<p>on the part of the Crown is, that allowing the challenge would lead

</p>
<p>to delay. I answer, that it would only postpone the trial for a short
</p>
<p>time. Delay is necessary when a packed jury list is made out for
</p>
<p>the purpose of injuring us. But even if your Lordships do not con-
</p>
<p>sider that you have jurisdiction to act in this case, I would apply to
</p>
<p>the Attorney General himself, and ask him, even at the eleventh
</p>
<p>hour, to reconsider the decision he has come to, because I ask him
</p>
<p>how can he expect that this trial will be satisfactory to the country,
</p>
<p>if there is a conviction, per fas ant nefas, when the fact of the fraud
</p>
<p>is admitted?
</p>
<p>The Attorney General.  I made no such allegation, or no such
</p>
<p>admission, and no counsel is justified in stating that I did.
</p>
<p>Sir Colman O'Loghlen.  I merely stated that the Attorney Ge-
</p>
<p>neral admits the fact by the demurrer which he has taken to the
</p>
<p>challenge.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon.  My Lords, I am, with my friend Sir Col-
</p>
<p>man CLoghlen, to sustain the challenge, not only on the part of my
</p>
<p>30
</p>
<p>respected friend, Mr. O'Connell, but also of the other traversers,
</p>
<p>as it was not thought right that the time of the Court should be
</p>
<p>taken up by arguments offered by as many counsel as there are tra-
</p>
<p>versers. My Lords, an anxiety is plainly expressed in the Jury Act
</p>
<p>that the Jurors' Book, should be framed according to the provisions of
</p>
<p>it, that it may be fairly constituted. The legislature directs that a
</p>
<p>list should be made out by each collector, of every man residing with-
</p>
<p>in their respective districts, without wilfully omitting the name of any
</p>
<p>one individual. The legislature uses the comprehensive words, " all
</p>
<p>the names," in every instance. That being so, the question is, whe-
</p>
<p>ther a special jury panel, from which a substantial number of names
</p>
<p>is omitted, is properly constituted. Every person is interested in
</p>
<p>the list having all properly qualified persons included in it, and,
</p>
<p>therefore, it is directed that the list shall be open for the inspection
</p>
<p>of every person, for the purpose of suggesting or expunging names,
</p>
<p>and for the purpose of preventing the fatality which has occurred at
</p>
<p>the present trial, two of the parties on the list being erroneously de-
</p>
<p>scribed. The Attorney General stated that this Jurors' Book was made
</p>
<p>up from the list revised by the Recorder. Why was that not pleaded?
</p>
<p>It was alleged on the motion that there was some collusion between
</p>
<p>the unknown person, who made this omission, and the traversers. But
</p>
<p>the traversers have plainly averred that they were not in collusion,
</p>
<p>or in communication with him. 'If the Attorney General had taken
</p>
<p>issue on that averment, it would have been decided whether it was
</p>
<p>true or false. It is common reason and common sense that a man
</p>
<p>accused of a heinous crime, is entitled to be tried by a jury legally
</p>
<p>constituted ; and it is no answer to tell him that it has not been le-
</p>
<p>gally constructed, but the prosecutor is no party to the fraud, which
</p>
<p>has been committed by a person unknown to you and to them. The
</p>
<p>law says, that the Recorder shall cause to be made out a list, com-
</p>
<p>prehending the names of all those persons adjudged to be properly
</p>
<p>qualified. The Recorder did not do so. Those acting for the Crown
</p>
<p>had distinct and express notice that the list was fraudulently and ille-
</p>

<p>is the present one. Suppose the case of a jury list so cut up as to
</p>
<p>consist only of outrageous partisans, and a jury struck by the Sheriff
</p>
<p>from such a list ; is the party to be first tried, then punished, and
</p>
<p>then to have his remedy against the sheriff? Yet that is the pro-
</p>
<p>position which the Court is called on to entertain. I admit that it is
</p>
<p>always presumed that a public officer does his duty until the contrary
</p>
<p>appears ; and the contrary appears here. The Recorder's own hand-
</p>
<p>writing is to the parish list. He had a simple and easy duty to per-
</p>
<p>form, to see that the general list was made out correctly from it, and
</p>
<p>to rectify the omissions. Those are the provisions of the Act of Par-
</p>
<p>liament. They have not been complied with, and gross neglect has
</p>
<p>taken place. Is the Recorder to be presumed to have done his duty
</p>
<p>after this proof that he has not done it? Fraud will vitiate every-
</p>
<p>thing. It will vitiate a judgment of your Lordships' court, or of
</p>
<p>the House of Lords. Fraud committed, even without the intent
</p>
<p>of the parties, will vitiate the most solemn deed. If it is al-
</p>
<p>31
</p>
<p>tered by a third party it is no longer valid. There is no pro-
</p>
<p>ceeding in law which fraud will not invalidate ; and will it not
</p>
<p>vitiate the construction of a tribunal which is to pronounce the
</p>
<p>guilt or innocence of the person accused, who, in the oldest lan-
</p>
<p>guage of the law, is always to be presumed to be innocent, until he
</p>
<p>is proved to be guilty. In such a case the Court should try to get rid
</p>
<p>of technicalities, in order to arrive at a just conclusion. We have
</p>
<p>heard much of the delay of justice. For the purpose of rectifying
</p>
<p>this fraud, it is a desirable thing to delay justice. But the delay
</p>
<p>necessary for rectifying the omission will be short. It is the right of
</p>
<p>the subject and the duty of the Crown to delay this trial. The
</p>
<p>Attorney General has objected to this pleading for want of techni-
</p>
<p>cality. He says that there is no averment ; that the Recorder
</p>
<p>handed over a list to the Clerk of the Peace. There is an averment
</p>
<p>that he handed him over an illegal list. The argument of the
</p>
<p>AttorneyGeneral is this : that because the 35th section gives a remedy
</p>
<p>in a certain case, it was not intended that there should be one in other
</p>
<p>cases. That is a complete non sequitur. No provision was made
</p>
<p>for a case like this, because the Legislature did not presume that
</p>
<p>such an occurrence could take place. Let me not be understood
</p>
<p>that I object to any gentleman on the panel of twenty-four, who
</p>
<p>have been called over. Let no man imagine that I intend to allege
</p>
<p>or insinuate that any one of them is not a fair and upright and im-
</p>
<p>partial juror. I think it necessary to guard myself against that sup-
</p>
<p>position. That is not the question at all. I know not who the
</p>
<p>gentlemen are who have been selected. I am arguing against the
</p>
<p>legality of the panel. I am not suggesting that we cannot receive a
</p>
<p>fair trial from the jurors who have been called. I know them not,
</p>
<p>and I am therefore entitled to presume that they are upright and
</p>
<p>honourable men.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor General.  My Lords, before I reply to the se-
</p>
<p>veral objections which have been relied on, I must advert to an
</p>
<p>expression which was made use of by Sir Colman O'Loghlen. I
</p>
<p>certainly did regret to hear him make use of such an expression,

</p>
<p>which I would willingly attribute to inadvertence  I mean the ex-
</p>
<p>pression " a packed jury." 1 must give him the benefit of that sup-
</p>
<p>position, because I am unwilling to suppose he used the expression
</p>
<p>wilfully, as it was totally unjustified by the case put on his own
</p>
<p>showing. I would not advert to this, but that I felt that an erro-
</p>
<p>neous impression might go before the public, from the words which
</p>
<p>were so thrown out, which were wholly unjustifiable and untenable.
</p>
<p>Am I not authorized in saying, that such were unjustifiable, when
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon was obliged to admit that he had no grounds for
</p>
<p>saying that any of the gentlemen who had been summoned would
</p>
<p>not fairly decide the issue, and therefore I hope the expression was
</p>
<p>not deliberately used.
</p>
<p>My Lords, I shall now apply myself to the legal grounds upon
</p>
<p>which it is contended that this challenge ought to be allowed. The
</p>
<p>Attorney General insisted, as I do now, that in point of law this
</p>
<p>challenge is not maintainable. I think that it is different altogether
</p>
<p>32
</p>
<p>from the case of a challenge on the ground of uninclifference in the
</p>
<p>Sheriff. I am not prepared to argue, that if a challenge were put
</p>
<p>upon the ground that the Sheriff had arranged the panel partially,
</p>
<p>that such would have been a bad challenge, because no such special
</p>
<p>objection has been relied on.
</p>
<p>It is said that the word "all" is a material word in the Act of
</p>
<p>Parliament, and in the challenge. Your Lordships will recollect,
</p>
<p>that the foundation of the argument of the Attorney General is,
</p>
<p>that certain averments were omitted, which were necessary to be
</p>
<p>made, in order to repel the legal presumption, that certain officers
</p>
<p>had done their duty. He said, they have not negatived the fact,
</p>
<p>that the Recorder did make a list ; but it is said that they did do so,
</p>
<p>because the word "all" is material, and that if an issue had been
</p>
<p>taken, it would be incumbent on us to shew that every name had
</p>
<p>been introduced, and that if there was a single omission, or a single
</p>
<p>misarrangement, the Recorder would not have put in all the names,
</p>
<p>and consequently that amounts to a denial that he made a list ; but
</p>
<p>even supposing that a name had been omitted, it is idle to say that
</p>
<p>they have put upon that record any thing like the allegation, that no
</p>
<p>lists had been made out. They have alleged that no list contain-
</p>
<p>ing all the names was made out ; but it is plain, he did make out a
</p>
<p>list, arranged in some form. It is then said, the Recorder was
</p>
<p>bound to deliver a list of all the names he had adjudicated upon.
</p>
<p>The question here is, whether the book when handed to the Sheriff,
</p>
<p>is or is not a book which is to furnish the juries for the ensuing
</p>
<p>year ? We are taunted with this, that certain persons did something
</p>
<p>with a list. That may be consistent with the allegation that it was
</p>
<p>done before the Recorder had made the list. Suppose a list had
</p>
<p>been fraudulently furnished to the Recorder ; it would be monstrous
</p>
<p>to say that was a fraudulent list, not because the Recorder was guilty
</p>
<p>of the fraud, but because some person had practised a fraud upon
</p>
<p>him. They do not say by whom the illegal list was made up ; but
</p>
<p>there is a general assertion that the list was made up fraudulently.
</p>
<p>It is said that we have admitted by our demurrer this to be to the

</p>
<p>manifest prejudice of the traversers. We do not admit any such
</p>
<p>thing, for that could only arise upon facts which do not appear upon
</p>
<p>the record. I refer to this, as it is important to disabuse the public,
</p>
<p>from the assertions of counsel that such admissions had been made.
</p>
<p>It is said, then, we should have joined issue upon the fraud. What
</p>
<p>fact could we join issue upon? I have always considered if fraud is
</p>
<p>meant to be imputed, it should be specified  it should be fastened
</p>
<p>upon some person in some manner. What issue could be taken upon
</p>
<p>an allegation, to which no defence could be applied ? What is to go
</p>
<p>to the jury? There is no single fact averred, there is no single
</p>
<p>person charged with fraud, and am I then to be told we admit fraud,
</p>
<p>because we do not take issue upon what is not alleged ; it is therefore
</p>
<p>impossible we could take issue, and because that is so, we are forced
</p>
<p>to demur. How can I admit fraud by a person unknown ? Suppose
</p>
<p>a fraud did exist, why did they not put it upon the challenge
</p>
<p>that the fraud occurred through the default of the Recorder, or
</p>
<p>33
</p>
<p>some person employed by him? then we might be called upon to go
</p>
<p>before a jury, and to risk that upon an issue. Then it is said, that
</p>
<p>if the Sheriff had acted fraudulently, that would be a good ground of
</p>
<p>challenge. I do not dispute that; I do not go the length of saying
</p>
<p>that if the Sheriff was guilty of improper conduct, that would not be
</p>
<p>a good ground of challenge. But it is said, that there is no differ-
</p>
<p>ence between fraud by the Sheriff, and those who had acted before
</p>
<p>the lists came to his hands. That does not follow. When the book
</p>
<p>once comes into the Sheriff's hands it cannot be altered, but is to re-
</p>
<p>main the book for that year, therefore it is idle to say that there is
</p>
<p>an analogy between the facts, before it comes to the Sheriff's hands,
</p>
<p>and afterwards.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton  Does not the allegation in the challenge
</p>
<p>amount to this, that the list was fraudulently made out, and that
</p>
<p>fraud was committed in omitting the names of sixty persons, whose
</p>
<p>names had been adjudicated upon?
</p>
<p>The Solicitor General.  I admit that there is a general allegation
</p>
<p>of fraud, but in the legal sense that is not a sufficient allegation. It.
</p>
<p>is further alleged, that it was to the prejudice of the traversers, and
</p>
<p>it is said that should be replied to. That should not be replied to,
</p>
<p>because it is a mere inference that it is to the prejudice of the tra-
</p>
<p>versers, without stating any facts. If they had stated that persons
</p>
<p>unfriendly to them were put on the list, that would be an allegation
</p>
<p>of a fact, from which an inference could be drawn ; but in the ab-
</p>
<p>sence of any fact, there is a general objection, that a fraud was com-
</p>
<p>mitted by some person unknown, to the prejudice of the traversers.
</p>
<p>Suppose it was done by a person who did not mean to injure the tra-
</p>
<p>versers, but to serve them. It may have been clone by such person
</p>
<p>unknown to them  but whether they were known or not, yet, when
</p>
<p>it takes place without default of any person over whom the Court
</p>
<p>has control, it would be monstrous to say that therefore the Jury Book
</p>
<p>should be thrown aside. An appeal has been made to the Attorney
</p>
<p>General, that he ought to yield to this challenge, as otherwise there
</p>
<p>could not be a trial, which would be satisfactory to the country. I

<p>could understand this, if the objection were to the special jury pa-
</p>
<p>nel returned by the Sheriff: but we are told that the Jury Book for
</p>
<p>1844, handed by the Sheriff to the Clerk of the Peace, omitted fifty-
</p>
<p>nine names, and that the book could not be used for the year 1844. If
</p>
<p>then, we yield to that, the result would be, that either the trial must
</p>
<p>stand over until January, or, if they were to be tried, they should be
</p>
<p>tried by the condemned jury panel of 1843, for the revision of which
</p>
<p>the trial stood over to the present time. It is said, that we ad-
</p>
<p>mit the Jurors' Book was illegal ; we do not admit any such thing.
</p>
<p>When I take the demurrer to this challenge, I admit the facts
</p>
<p>pleaded, but I do not admit the legality, because that is a question
</p>
<p>of law, and not fact, and it is for that purpose we have taken the de-
</p>
<p>murrer. We are called on to consent to have this book amended :
</p>
<p>we could not consent; it would be illegal; because, by the provisions
</p>
<p>of the Act, after the book once gets into the Sheriff's hands ; it cannot
</p>
<p>be amended, it is not competent to make the alteration. If we had
</p>
<p>F
</p>
<p>34
</p>
<p>consented, we would have consented to what we had no right to do,
</p>
<p>nay, more, this Court could not order it to be done; but, if we did
</p>
<p>consent, the consequence it would lead to would be this, that every
</p>
<p>trial by this panel would be open to the same objection. This case
</p>
<p>has been argued, as if there was no case to be tried by this jury pa-
</p>
<p>nel but the case of the Queen v. Daniel O' 'Connelly and it seems
</p>
<p>to be expected that the case should be different from any other case.
</p>
<p>The charge is, that fifty or sixty names have been omitted, if those
</p>
<p>names were introduced, there would be a ground of challenge for so
</p>
<p>introducing them.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin.  If the Recorder had found that in copying
</p>
<p>the general list, the clerk had made some mistake, if he had disco-
</p>
<p>vered that before they were given to the Sheriff, had he not power to
</p>
<p>correct it ?
</p>
<p>The Solicitor General  I think not. The object of the Act was,
</p>
<p>that there should be a book, which, when made up, should be unal-
</p>
<p>terable. The 35th section provides, that if any person offends
</p>
<p>against the Act by altering the jury list, and it is proved to the satis-
</p>
<p>faction of the justices, he shall be liable to a penalty. If, therefore,
</p>
<p>the Sheriff had taken upon him to put in or omit names of per-
</p>
<p>sons unqualified, he would have done what must have subjected
</p>
<p>him to a penalty, and which would be good ground of challenge.
</p>
<p>Further, suppose a trial at an Assizes occurring after the delivery
</p>
<p>of the jurors' book to the Sheriff, and, after a verdict, a convic-
</p>
<p>tion occurred under the Act for a fraudulent error in the book, and
</p>
<p>then, pursuant to the Act, the book was amended, it could not, in such
</p>
<p>case, be contended, that the verdict could be set aside, and if so, it
</p>
<p>follows that a finding by a jury, selected from the present list, must
</p>
<p>be a correct one.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore  I am instructed, on the part of the traversers, to
</p>
<p>consent that the list should be sent back to the Recorder, for the
</p>
<p>purpose of being amended, and that then a new special jury should
</p>
<p>be struck, and the trial proceeded with.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General  I object altogether to the proposal. It

</p>
<p>is a proposal which cannot be complied with : there is no power in
</p>
<p>the Act by which it could be done. The alteration would affect
</p>
<p>every proceeding taken during the whole year, and if any person was
</p>
<p>tried under the new list it would be erroneous, and a party not bound
</p>
<p>by the consent could object to the proceedings.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  The majority of the Court are of opi-
</p>
<p>nion that this demurrer must be allowed, and consequently, that the chal-
</p>
<p>lenge must be overruled. The subject matter is not new tothe conside-
</p>
<p>ration of the Court, inasmuch as the argument has embraced in sub-
</p>
<p>stance what the Court were occupied with on Friday last, and the Court
</p>
<p>then gave judgment : and upon every consideration I have been able
</p>
<p>to give the subject since, I have found no reason to find fault with
</p>
<p>the judgment then pronounced; on the contrary, all the considera-
</p>
<p>tion I have been able to give the case since, and in the progress of
</p>
<p>the argument to-day, has tended to confirm the opinion I then enter-
</p>
<p>tained. The application then under the consideration of the Court
</p>
<p>35
</p>
<p>was, that for certain reasons then brought forward, I he panel should
</p>
<p>be quashed. By the present proceeding, the same question pre-
</p>
<p>cisely is not the question upon which we are called on to give judg-
</p>
<p>ment, but I confess I cannot see the principle winch would lead me,
</p>
<p>on the present occasion, to entertain a different judgment from what
</p>
<p>I then formed, and in which I had the concurrence of my brethren on
</p>
<p>the bench. At present, the case comes before the Court in the
</p>
<p>shape of a challenge to the array. There are several challenges, but
</p>
<p>in delivering the judgment of the Court, I shall consider the case as
</p>
<p>if there was only one, as the cases do not contain any ground of dis-
</p>
<p>tinction between them. Whatever rule is right in one case is right
</p>
<p>in the others. Now the objection, as spread upon the face of the
</p>
<p>challenge, is this: that the Recorder of Dublin having, in the revi-
</p>
<p>sion of names presented to him for his judgment and consideration,
</p>
<p>upon the question of their allowance to be admitted upon the jury
</p>
<p>list or not, did not, as he was bound to do by the law, make from
</p>
<p>that list so presented to him, a return of all the names contained
</p>
<p>upon those lists, nor did he make the arrangement required in the
</p>
<p>new list prescribed by the Statute, when he came to arrange, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to rank and property, the names of all persons presented to him
</p>
<p>for revision, as coming from the officer in the first instance, but, on
</p>
<p>the contrary, he omitted so to do. It then goes on to state, that the
</p>
<p>said lists did not contain the names of all persons whose qualifications
</p>
<p>had been allowed upon the correcting, allowing, and signing said lists
</p>
<p>by the Recorder, but that he omitted the names of fifty-nine persons.
</p>
<p>It then avers that the said persons are resident within the district to
</p>
<p>which they belong, and that they are qualified to serve. Now, the
</p>
<p>question is, that statement having been demurred toby the Attorney
</p>
<p>General, and therefore the facts being admitted so far as they were
</p>
<p>properly pleaded, is that a ground for the allowance of this chal-
</p>
<p>lenge to the array of the jury panel? It is necessary to consider
</p>
<p>what the law is under which those proceedings have taken place. It
</p>
<p>is a code of law incorporated into one Act, the previously existing
</p>
<p>law being thereby essentially modified and altered. Just to give an

</p>
<p>outline of what that system of laws is, as so introduced, I shall take
</p>
<p>the liberty of stating my general views upon this Act. It was made
</p>
<p>for the entire kingdom. It is not restricted to the case of the Queen
</p>
<p>v. O' Connell. It is not an act restricted to one county, but is appli-
</p>
<p>cable to and intended to be a statutable provision for the appointment
</p>
<p>of juries throughout Ireland during the ensuing year. Now what
</p>
<p>were the steps to be taken under it ? The Act finds a list of officers
</p>
<p>provided, some of high rank and distinction, others in subordinate
</p>
<p>stations ; some, like the Recorder and the magistrates in other
</p>
<p>Courts, invested with high judicial powers; others again merely mi-
</p>
<p>nisterial officers, entrusted in different degrees and at different stages
</p>
<p>with the administration of the law connected with the preparing of the
</p>
<p>lists from which the jury were afterwards to be selected. There is
</p>
<p>a great distinction throughout the Act between judicial and ministe-
</p>
<p>rial officers. The Recorder is judicial ; the magistrates at sessions
</p>
<p>are judicial; the Sheriff is ministerial ; the collectors are all ministe-
</p>
<p>30
</p>
<p>rial. Now, according as the officers so called into operation are of
</p>
<p>a judicial or of a ministerial character, in different degrees is entrusted
</p>
<p>to them the carrying the Act into operation. I must observe, that
</p>
<p>although the Act contains a great many provisions, though it appears
</p>
<p>a well-considered Act, intending to provide a general system con-
</p>
<p>nected with the administration of justice, and of the highest importance
</p>
<p>to all suitors and all persons, whose life, property, and character are
</p>
<p>at stake, and though intended to repeal all former Acts, and to make a
</p>
<p>general provision under the system detailed in this Act, no further
</p>
<p>proceeding appears in any part of the Statute, to limit or control the
</p>
<p>powers therein mentioned to have been provided, except as specified
</p>
<p>in the Act. The proceedings under the Act begin with the minis-
</p>
<p>terial officers. The Clerk of the Peace, at a certain time of the
</p>
<p>year, in the month of July, with a view to prepare the jury list for
</p>
<p>the ensuing year, is to issue his precept to the High Constable and
</p>
<p>the several cess collectors, to make out and prepare a list of all who
</p>
<p>are to be called on to serve on the jury list. The Act defines who are
</p>
<p>to be admitted upon the jury list, and takes the precaution that none
</p>
<p>are to be admitted but those who are qualified to discharge the duty
</p>
<p>of such officer; and on the other hand, it equally desires that no
</p>
<p>person should be rejected who is duly qualified. In the city of
</p>
<p>Dublin, the parish collectors are the officers corresponding to the
</p>
<p>barony collectors in the counties in Ireland ; and as the challenge
</p>
<p>has reference to the city of Dublin alone, I shall, in my observations
</p>
<p>on the Act, consider it as if it was an Act severally and solely for the
</p>
<p>city of Dublin.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Peace issues his precept to the parish collectors,
</p>
<p>and they are enjoined by the language of the Act, to make full and
</p>
<p>accurate lists, omitting none, and rejecting none that are qualified ;
</p>
<p>and they are to make a return of those lists to the Clerk of the
</p>
<p>Peace, and after a certain time those lists are to be laid before the
</p>
<p>Recorder, for his revision and adjudication upon the subject. What
</p>
<p>is he to revise and adjudicate upon ? The right of every person
</p>
<p>within the several parishes, who claims a right to be admitted upon

</p>
<p>the list ; and on the other hand, objections to the admission of any
</p>
<p>improper person who should fail to establish his right. Now, in
</p>
<p>order that those matters may be fairly investigated, the lists so re-
</p>
<p>turned are to remain open, in the office of the Clerk of the Peace,
</p>
<p>for a period of three weeks, and every person who may have a
</p>
<p>desire to look at the lists, is entitled by law to make himself master

<p>of them, according as they are returned. A party may oppose the
</p>
<p>claim of a person desiring to be admitted as a juror, and it is for the
</p>
<p>Recorder exclusively and finally to make an adjudication whether he
</p>
<p>is to be admitted ov rejected. He is armed with full power to en-
</p>
<p>able him to conduct the investigation to a satisfactory conclusion, but
</p>
<p>he is not to do so without giving the parties interested notice
</p>
<p>whether their claims are disputed. After that public investigation,
</p>
<p>the Recorder comes to a judicial decision, which, so far as I am
</p>
<p>aware of, is not controllable by any power in the community, if it
</p>
<p>be not done corruptly. The Court of Queen's Bench has a super-
</p>
<p>37
</p>
<p>intending power over all magistrates and officers, if an attempt is
</p>
<p>made to evade the law, or to violate it by fraud or corruption ; but
</p>
<p>if no such charge is made out, their conduct is not subject to investi-
</p>
<p>gation or control. The Recorder has been selected by the Legisla-
</p>
<p>ture as the judicial determiner of cases of this description. It is a
</p>
<p>high and important privilege with which he is so invested, and with
</p>
<p>it, is in a great measure connected the flow and fountain of justice,
</p>
<p>and the purity of the administration of the law. But he was left
</p>
<p>without control ; and there may be very good reason why he was
</p>
<p>so, as we may presume there was for making his decision final
</p>
<p>and beyond appeal. In this case the precepts were issued and re-
</p>
<p>turned by the parish officers; the time was appointed for the inves-
</p>
<p>tigation ; it took place, and the Recorder made his revision, and
</p>
<p>having pronounced his decision, it was irrevisable, and could not
</p>
<p>be reversed by any one. After that was done, another duty is im-
</p>
<p>posed on him, that is, that he shall make, or cause to be made, a
</p>
<p>new list, arranging the persons according to rank and property ; and
</p>
<p>the Act directs, that in the newly arranged lists, he shall include all
</p>
<p>persons who, on a previous revision, have substantiated their claims
</p>
<p>before him. But it is to be observed, that no penalty is imposed on
</p>
<p>the Recorder for omitting to do this, or any other duty which the
</p>
<p>Act imposed on him. There is no imputation in this challenge, that
</p>
<p>the omission which is said to have taken place on the part of the Re-
</p>
<p>corder, was the consequence of improper conduct, malversation, or
</p>
<p>corruption  none was imputed to him. But it was said the Act
</p>
<p>required he should make out the new lists according to rank and
</p>
<p>property, classing the persons according to such order required by
</p>
<p>the Act, and that he should do so with respect to all whose claims
</p>
<p>should be allowed. I do not know how far this is to be carried, but if
</p>
<p>I understand the argument right, they push it to that extent. Here
</p>
<p>were two duties imposed on the Recorder. First, he is to revise the
</p>
<p>lists delivered to him by the collector, and he then is to make a new
</p>
<p>list according to rank and property ; and he was equally bound to
</p>
<p>have made no omission, but to have included in the classification of

</p>
<p>rank and property, every individual, just as much as he was bound
</p>
<p>by the Act to have allowed or disallowed his claim generally to be
</p>
<p>received as a juror. Now how far is that to be carried ? Suppose
</p>
<p>the Recorder had included every person whose claim had been
</p>
<p>allowed, but suppose he had omitted to class them according to rank
</p>
<p>and property, are all subsequent proceedings to be avoided, and
</p>
<p>lo be the subject of a challenge to the array, because he has
</p>
<p>omitted to follow the directions of the Statute in this one in-
</p>
<p>stance. Suppose he did make a classification according to rank
</p>
<p>and property, and suppose he admitted all those persons entitled, will it
</p>
<p>be contended that he has made a wrong classification, because, by
</p>
<p>the judgment he has come to, he has put men worth 2000 at the
</p>
<p>bottom of the list, and put at the top men not worth so many hun-
</p>
<p>dreds. Unquestionably he would have deviated from the directions
</p>
<p>of the Statute, but is that a reason why all those proceedings should
</p>
<p>be null and void, and why, if a trial took place, it should be in the
</p>
<p>38
</p>
<p>power of either of the parties to show that part of the Act had been
</p>
<p>deviated from, and that, therefore, the jury panel in that parti-
</p>
<p>cular case was good for nothing. If the argument he correct, the
</p>
<p>consequences must go that length, and I cannot help thinking that
</p>
<p>such a decision would be most injurious and dangerous to the com-
</p>
<p>munity. This is a judicial act in the Recorder, as much in one case
</p>
<p>as the other. The Act is directory in pointing out to what his atten-
</p>
<p>tion is to be directed, but it leaves and intrusts to his discretion the
</p>
<p>manner in which he should act. Now, if that be so, and that is the
</p>
<p>position in which the Recorder stood, then his act is not to be the
</p>
<p>subject matter of a challenge to the array. I do not mean to ques-
</p>
<p>tion whether the special jury panel may not be challenged : several
</p>
<p>cases were cited, in which it was so decided : I do not mean to contro-
</p>
<p>vert that, the more so as it seems not to have been pressed on the other
</p>
<p>side. But I observe that in those cases a protest was made uphold-
</p>
<p>ing their right, and nothing was done to remove it. It is not because
</p>
<p>the challenge was to the array of the special jury, but because the
</p>
<p>Recorder has not followed out the directions of the Act of Parliament,
</p>
<p>and that some person unknown has had the opportunity of making
</p>
<p>an alteration in the lists so returned, the sixty persons whose names
</p>
<p>had been allowed by the Recorder do not now stand upon the list.
</p>
<p>The Recorder was not answerable for that ; no blame was imputed
</p>
<p>to him in the way of any thing corrupt or fraudulent. If he had made
</p>
<p>a mistake, no person would contend that was to be the subject matter
</p>
<p>of investigation. Moreover, no person in the community has a re-
</p>
<p>vising or controlling power vested in him, and if he had come to a
</p>
<p>wrong conclusion, the Court of Queen's Bench has no power of in-
</p>
<p>vestigating whether he was right or not. There is no averment in
</p>
<p>the challenge he did not make out the lists according to the Act; the
</p>
<p>averment is that he did not make out such a list without excluding
</p>
<p>any. The list, so made out according to rank and property, is handed
</p>
<p>by him to the Clerk of the Peace, the officer selected by the Statute,
</p>
<p>with whom such lists should be deposited; then the Recorder's duty
</p>
<p>and jurisdiction are at an end. The list then goes into the hands of a sub-

<p>ordinate officer, whose duty is chalked out by the Act of Parliament,
</p>
<p>which he was bound to follow, and to transmit this list to the hands
</p>
<p>of the Sheriff; the duty of the Clerk of the Peace is to have the list
</p>
<p>made out, called the Jury List, and when it is so made out it is his
</p>
<p>business to hand it to the Sheriff. The Sheriff receives it, and if
</p>
<p>there had been corruption on the part of the Sheriff, who is the
</p>
<p>officer of this Court, not like the Recorder who is not, whose
</p>
<p>duties are intimately connected with preparing the jury list, he
</p>
<p>would be liable to be called on to account, and moreover that
</p>
<p>would be properly the subject matter of challenge to the array
</p>
<p>growing out of the unindifferency of the Sheriff. But this is
</p>
<p>not the case with the Recorder. Who is to try his unindifferency ?
</p>
<p>He is not here, or represented by counsel. Being a judicial offi-
</p>
<p>cer, he stands besides in the same situation as the Master of the
</p>
<p>Crown Office, in the case cited from Barn. & Aid. In that case
</p>
<p>the Court, on public grounds, would not allow his conduct to be in-
</p>
<p>39
</p>
<p>vestigated. If the conduct of the Master of the Crown Office would
</p>
<p>not be entered into, a fortiori the Recorder's cannot. This matter,
</p>
<p>unless there is some fraud on the part of the Recorder, cannot be
</p>
<p>entered into upon a challenge taken to the array by a person who
</p>
<p>comes for trial upon the issue joined by the parties, with which the
</p>
<p>Recorder has nothing to do. The Recorder has decided the mat-
</p>
<p>ter, and his decision is final. It would be a great inconvenience
</p>
<p>that a delay should arise in this case, because the formation of the
</p>
<p>jury panel is a matter which the country is interested in upholding.
</p>
<p>A proposition was made by Mr. Moore ; I am not called on to say
</p>
<p>whether the Attorney General should have accepted that offer; I
</p>
<p>am not called on to give judgment on that; but I say, every person
</p>
<p>who may be a suitor during the year 1844, has a direct interest in
</p>
<p>supporting and sustaining those proceedings. What would be the
</p>
<p>consequence if those proceedings are to be set aside ? The neces-
</p>
<p>sary consequence would be, that it would be open to every person
</p>
<p>to take such an objection, and that his adversary would not have the
</p>
<p>power or the means of resisting the objection and upholding the list.
</p>
<p>This is a general list, and the parlies concerned in supporting it are
</p>
<p>all the persons who may be suitors for the year 1844. They would
</p>
<p>have no means of explaining the facts alleged against the panel, be-
</p>
<p>cause they were no parties to the making up of the general list, and
</p>
<p>knew nothing of it. This Act was introduced for the general pur-
</p>
<p>poses of the country, and whether wisely or not, the law has provided
</p>
<p>that the proceedings of the Recorder should be considered as judicial,
</p>
<p>and not capable of being appealed from, or revised by any other tribu-
</p>
<p>nal. The result is, that the jury list being prepared, the Sheriff is
</p>
<p>obliged by the law to take the materials as he finds them returned
</p>
<p>to him by the Clerk of the Peace, from which return he is to form
</p>
<p>his special jury. He has no power of altering it. He could not add
</p>
<p>to it any of the names which have been omitted ; therefore, there
</p>
<p>being a general beneficial object to be attended to, there being, as far
</p>
<p>as I can see, no intention on the part of the Legislature to give any
</p>
<p>power of investigating or appealing from the proceedings before the

<p>Recorder, inasmuch as they are of ajudicial and not a ministerial kind ;
</p>
<p>my opinion is, that the demurrer must be allowed. I do not mean
</p>
<p>to throw out any opinion as to what has taken place. It may be ex-
</p>
<p>plained, or may remain in obscurity. That is not the question. We
</p>
<p>have no power of investigating it. I therefore think, in conformity
</p>
<p>with the judgment of the Court on Friday, that this challenge is
</p>
<p>not maintainable.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Burton.  This case has been the subject of so
</p>
<p>learned and deliberate a judgment by my Lord Chief Justice, and I
</p>
<p>so fully concur in all that has been said by him, that I do not think
</p>
<p>it necessary to occupy the public time further at this hour. I do
</p>
<p>not entertain any reasonable doubt on the subject ; and I can only
</p>
<p>say that I have felt a great deal of anxiety in the course of the dis-
</p>
<p>cussion, that every thing which concerns the administration of justice
</p>
<p>in the superior courts should be free from every possible imputation,
</p>
<p>and that there should be no interruption to the course of strict and
</p>
<p>40
</p>
<p>impartial justice. I certainly feel every inclination that all persons
</p>
<p>fit to be on the jury, and who are in such a rank as to qualify them
</p>
<p>to it, should be on the Jurors' Book, so that the great end of public
</p>
<p>justice should be effected, not only between the parties immediately
</p>
<p>before the Court, but other parties who may become suitors in the
</p>
<p>present year. I was for a moment struck with the proposition made
</p>
<p>by Mr. Moore, which I understood exactly as he explained it,  that,
</p>
<p>without investigating the strict law of (he case, the parties should
</p>
<p>consent that the persons omitted should be in the present case con-
</p>
<p>sidered as if they were on the Jurors' Book, and a new special jury
</p>
<p>should be struck. I was, I own, caught for a moment by the good
</p>
<p>sense of this proposition, and 1 am sure it was meant in perfect
</p>
<p>good faith; but I cannot but say, on consideration, that I think the
</p>
<p>most prudent course to be adopted on the part of the Crown was,
</p>
<p>not to accede to the proposition, not for the purpose of taking advan-
</p>
<p>tage of the mistake which has been made, or for embarrassing the
</p>
<p>traversers, but because it might lead to objections of a similar nature
</p>
<p>hereafter, which might be made use of for sinister purposes, and
</p>
<p>cause a great deal of embarrassment in courts of justice. We must
</p>
<p>consider this case with reference only to the challenge and the demur-
</p>
<p>rer ; and the first proposition which we have to determine is, whether
</p>
<p>the Jurors' Book, which has been made upon the revision, is a nullity ?
</p>
<p>We must see what jurisdiction there is to declare it a nullity. The
</p>
<p>principal directions given by the Statute have all been complied with.
</p>
<p>The Parish List, the General List, and the Jurors' Book were all made
</p>
<p>up. All this was done by the properly constituted authorities. The
</p>
<p>jury, therefore, are prima facie selected from the proper Jurors'
</p>
<p>Book. Then we have to consider, whether the omission which the
</p>
<p>challenge to the arrayavers has taken place, renders the Jurors' Book
</p>
<p>null and void. I should say, that upon this challenge the Court have
</p>
<p>little to do. I will not say that a case might not arise in which, cir-
</p>
<p>cumstanced as this array is, the Court would be called on to consider
</p>
<p>whether it is null and void. But in my judgment, the terms of this
</p>
<p>challenge do not warrant the Court in holding that the jury list is an
</p>

</p>
<p>actual nullity. I cannot say that it is perfect, that a better list
</p>
<p>might not have been made out ; but that is not the question. The
</p>
<p>question is, whether it is null and void? I will not say that proceed-
</p>
<p>ings of this kind may not be of so fraudulent a nature as to call for
</p>
<p>the interference of the Court. I should be sorry to lay down a pro-
</p>
<p>position such as that, and I will not venture to do so. Perhaps it
</p>
<p>may be of little value to test a proposition of this kind by extreme
</p>
<p>cases ; but perhaps they should not be entirely left out of consideration.
</p>
<p>Here are 717 persons admitted as persons fit and proper to serve on ju-
</p>
<p>ries. Suppose a case where there really were 700 or800 persons fit to
</p>
<p>serve as jurors, and that twenty or thirty only are returned. It would
</p>
<p>startle the mind to say the Court was bound by what was done
</p>
<p>there, But on the other hand, would it not be absurd to say this,
</p>
<p>that because a certain number of persons are omitted, suppose only
</p>
<p>one or two, that on that account all the proceedings are to be void ?
</p>
<p>That would make the statute which was passed for the purpose of
</p>
<p>41
</p>
<p>securing a good jury, nothing but a subject of litigation, and in I hat
</p>
<p>way it would be more injurious than beneficial. I do not think,
</p>
<p>therefore, that the simple circumstance of the omission of a certain
</p>
<p>number of qualified persons, either through blunder or mistake, or
</p>
<p>improper conduct, is sufficient to render all the proceedings a nullity ;
</p>
<p>and for my part, I think that in this case the challenge is not sup-
</p>
<p>ported by the allegation of such matter as would authorize the Court
</p>
<p>to hold the proceedings a nullity. The traversers have not asserted
</p>
<p>but deprecated the presumption, or the supposition that the Recorder
</p>
<p>acted with any fraudulent intent in what he has done. It has been
</p>
<p>put as an inference from the facts, that he may have been grossly
</p>
<p>negligent. If that be so, why not state that as a ground of chal-
</p>
<p>lenge? If it was intended to be relied on, it should have been
</p>
<p>stated. It is said that a certain number of names has been omitted;
</p>
<p>on the other hand, it is not denied that 717 persons are returned,
</p>
<p>and thev furnish a sufficient number of persons to select a fair and
</p>
<p>impartial jury from. In order to authorize us to interfere, something
</p>
<p>more should be shown. The nature of such misconduct should be
</p>
<p>alleged and stated, and specifically stated, so as to enable the Court
</p>
<p>to judge upon it. This is not stated, and we are called upon to de-
</p>
<p>cide upon a supposition of this kind, not that the Jurors' Book is
</p>
<p>of no effect as to the parties in this particular case, but that it is
</p>
<p>null and void altogether, and no person bound by it ; and although
</p>
<p>it is much to be regretted, that such a number of qualified persons
</p>
<p>should have been left out of the list, I have satisfied myself that
</p>
<p>we should not be acting on sound legal principles, were we to declare
</p>
<p>the whole proceedings void on this occasion.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Cbampton.  After the elaborate judgments which
</p>
<p>have been delivered by my Lord Chief Justice and my brother Bur-
</p>
<p>ton, I would not, at this late hour, occupy the time of the Court
</p>
<p>further than by saying that I concur in that judgment, were it not
</p>
<p>that as one of the Court is of a different opinion, I feel bound to
</p>
<p>state my reasons for that judgment in this important case. The
</p>
<p>traversers complain of a particular injury to themselves, and, also

</p>
<p>of an injury of a serious and monstrous character, which they say
</p>
<p>is likely to result if this challenge be not allowed; on the other
</p>
<p>hand, it is said on the part of the prosecution, that a very serious
</p>
<p>injury is likely to result to the public, if this challenge should be held
</p>
<p>good. Now I quite agree with the proposition, that it is the bounden
</p>
<p>duty of the Court to keep the fountains of justice clear; but I, for
</p>
<p>one, know no mode by which that can be better attained, than by
</p>
<p>the Court fairly administering the law between the parties. Let us
</p>
<p>see what the law is on this subject. This is a challenge of great no-
</p>
<p>velty, at all events it is quite unprecedented in point of form and
</p>
<p>substance ; I do not mean to say that an established principle may not
</p>
<p>be applied to it, and that parties might not avail themselves of that
</p>
<p>principle, but I own I feel very little difficulty in forming an opinion
</p>
<p>on this challenge  I think it bad, both in point of form and sub-
</p>
<p>stance ; I go farther than that, I should feel very great difficulty
</p>
<p>in allowing the doctrine, that a challenge exists to the array of a
</p>
<p>G
</p>
<p>42
</p>
<p>special jury, and undoubtedly the case of the King v. Edmonds is
</p>
<p>subject to a great deal of observation ; but I do not rest my judg-
</p>
<p>ment upon that, I only state it lest I should be understood as affirm-
</p>
<p>ing the doctrine that a challenge would apply to a special jury. But,
</p>
<p>suppose the challenge does apply, let us see whether it can be sup-
</p>
<p>ported in the present case. There is no imputation against the
</p>
<p>Sheriff, none against the Clerk of the Crown  they have discharged
</p>
<p>their duty regularly and properly ; the Sheriff's duty was merely
</p>
<p>formal, to attend there by himself and his agent, and to produce
</p>
<p>the books. This is all he has to do, the rest is performed for both
</p>
<p>parties by the Clerk of the Crown, on the part of both parties.
</p>
<p>His duty is merely ministerial. As to entering into a discussion, or
</p>
<p>making an adjudication with regard to the array of the panel he has
</p>
<p>no jurisdiction  his duty is merely to strike the special jury ; what
</p>
<p>then is the ground of the challenge? not unindifference in the
</p>
<p>public officer, no such thing. This case seems to me to be similar
</p>
<p>to the case of elisors, and it is clear there could be no challenge
</p>
<p>where elisors had made their return, or against the return of the
</p>
<p>Master of the Crown Office. The ground of challenge here is not
</p>
<p>unindifference in the Sheriff. What is the doctrine of challenge to
</p>
<p>the array founded on ? Take it on the highest authority, from the
</p>
<p>words of Lord Coke ; he says, " that the challenge to the array is
</p>
<p>" in respect of the cause of unindifference, or default of the She-
</p>
<p>" riff, or other officers that made the return, and not in respect
</p>
<p>" of the persons returned, where there is no unindifference or de-
</p>
<p>" fault in the Sheriff." That is the language of Lord Coke. But
</p>
<p>here the ground of challenge is not for unindifference in the Sheriff,
</p>
<p>or other officer making the return, but for partiality in an unknown
</p>
<p>person, who is supposed to have had access to the lists during the
</p>
<p>period they were under consideration, and before the Jurors' Book
</p>
<p>was formed. A fraud is alleged to have been committed, what is
</p>
<p>that fraud ? The name of the person who committed it is not
</p>
<p>stated, nor is the fraud itself distinctly set out, unless it be by the
</p>
<p>statement of the omission of the names, which statement is studiously

</p>
<p>separate from the allegation of fraud, which makes the challenge ex-
</p>
<p>tremely informal, though, no doubt, it was framed as accurately as it
</p>
<p>could be under the circumstances. The groundwork of the complaint,
</p>
<p>which is separated studiously from the charge of fraud, is this, namely,
</p>
<p>that the names of fifty or sixty persons, upon whom the Recorder
</p>
<p>had adjudicated as persons proper to be on the Jurors' Book, were
</p>
<p>not to be found upon that book, or rather upon the general list.
</p>
<p>What is ground of challenge to the array, according to law? A chal-
</p>
<p>lenge founded upon partiality in the officers. You may challenge the
</p>
<p>return for fraud or mistake in the officer, but fraud in a stranger
</p>
<p>will not give the Court jurisdiction. It is said that this challenge
</p>
<p>should be allowed, because the fraud, if any, was committed in the pro-
</p>
<p>cess, during the revision of the list. The Recorder is not charged with
</p>
<p>fraud, all that is imputed to him is negligence, not fraud. On the
</p>
<p>contrary, it is alleged on the face of the challenge, that the Recorder
</p>
<p>had examined, and revised, and signed the alphabetical list, and had
</p>
<p>43
</p>
<p>discharged his duty so far with perfect propriety, and that the sixty
</p>
<p>persons were adjudged as fit to be put on the general list, and therefore
</p>
<p>on the Jurors' Book. The words "adjudged," in the Act of Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment, is not unimportant, because it shows, as my Lord Chief Justice
</p>
<p>has observed, that the Recorder is the final judge, as to the duties
</p>
<p>which he has to perform under the Act; that his duties are strictly
</p>
<p>judicial duties, in the performance of which, there is no appeal
</p>
<p>to this Court, or to any body in the community. His acts are
</p>
<p>final, not subject to review or revision. He is responsible for the
</p>
<p>performance of those duties which the legislature has devolved on
</p>
<p>him, so far as a judge is responsible, not to any tribunal, but on higher
</p>
<p>grounds, and in another manner. The Recorder is first to pronounce
</p>
<p>an adjudication upon each name in the alphabetical list, and he is to
</p>
<p>sign that list ; that is his first duty. He has to perform another
</p>
<p>duty, not less important  he is to cause one general list to be made
</p>
<p>from the list which he has revised and signed, and he is to make this
</p>
<p>change, and this change only, that he is to arrange that list, not al-
</p>
<p>phabetically, but according to rank and property. This duty he is
</p>
<p>not to do with his own hands. That list is a statutable copy of his ad-
</p>
<p>judication, an exemplification, so to call it, of his adjudication. The
</p>
<p>Recorder is to cause the revised list to be truly and fairly copied, and
</p>
<p>he is to deliver it to the Clerk of the Peace ; the Clerk of the Peace
</p>
<p>copies everything, which, in contemplation of Jaw, is the act of the
</p>
<p>Recorder, who is the judge; his duty is to see that it is fairly and
</p>
<p>truly copied, and when that is done, he is to deliver it to the next
</p>
<p>officer in succession, on whom the duty of framing the Jurors' Book
</p>
<p>devolves. There is no allegation in this case, that the omission is
</p>
<p>the act of the Clerk of the Peace ; it is alleged to be the act of
</p>
<p>some person unknown. I say this exemplification is the testimonial
</p>
<p>of the judicial act of the Recorder. It is final, and no Court, no
</p>
<p>human being, has a right to examine it ; neither this, nor any other
</p>
<p>Court can go beyond it ; the returning officers are unconnected with
</p>
<p>it, whether Sheriff or Elisors  they have nothing to do but the plain
</p>
<p>duty devolved on them by this Act of Parliament. This challenge

<p>rests upon this ground, that no Jury Book was in existence, that is,
</p>
<p>there can be no special jury for 1844-, unless it be formed from the
</p>
<p>Jury Book of a former year, or by consent. The question is not, is
</p>
<p>there any defective Jury Book, or is there a Jury Book at all ; but is
</p>
<p>this Jury Book defective in not having sixty names on it ? We must
</p>
<p>take it for granted, that these names were omitted, as was observed
</p>
<p>by the Solicitor General ; the fact is not sworn to, but we must take
</p>
<p>it to be true. How far true ? For the purpose of this argument,
</p>
<p>but not further, or one moment longer. I pass by the fraud, that is
</p>
<p>too loose and too blind an allegation to make the ground of a chal-
</p>
<p>lenge; it is not said what it is, but they charge that there is an omis-
</p>
<p>sion of sixty names from the Jurors' Book. There may be an injury
</p>
<p>to the individuals here, but we are not to consider this case as be-
</p>
<p>tween the Crown and these parties ; but we are to consider it as a
</p>
<p>case involving the legality of all the special juries, and common ju-
</p>
<p>ries, during the course of the year ; and whether the whole course
</p>
<p>44
</p>
<p>of the administration of the law is to be suspended. Is it right that it
</p>
<p>should be so? I say most clearly it is not. What is the jurisdiction
</p>
<p>of the Court with regard to special juries? It is empowered to
</p>
<p>order a special jury, but it must be struck as required by the Act.
</p>
<p>What is the manner required by the Act ? I need not go through the
</p>
<p>Statute, but it must be struck from the Jurors' Book, emphatically;
</p>
<p>not a man can be taken from any other source. The Sheriff has no
</p>
<p>right to look to anything else. The names must be taken from the
</p>
<p>Jurors' Book, and can be taken from no other document or paper
</p>
<p>whatsoever. If the special jury is not to be taken from the Jurors'
</p>
<p>Book, where is it to be taken from ? It is evident, that if a special
</p>
<p>jury cannot be struck in this case, it cannot be struck in any other
</p>
<p>case. To enable the Court to get juries, it must have recourse to
</p>
<p>the Jurors' Book for 1844. If that be a nullity, there can be no
</p>
<p>Jurors' Book at all. Every single regulation of the Act of Parliament
</p>
<p>has been complied with here, with one exception. The state-
</p>
<p>ment of facts in the challenge is extremely loose. Every thing is
</p>
<p>stated in the nature of a negative pregnant. It is not alleged that
</p>
<p>the Recorder did not make out a juror's list, but the allegation is,
</p>
<p>he did not make a list containing the names of all the persons found
</p>
<p>on the revised list, thereby stating that he did not make a list,
</p>
<p>but that the list was defective. It goes on to allege that he did not
</p>
<p>deliver a list containing such names. This statement appears to
</p>
<p>be correct enough. The statement is, that for some cause or
</p>
<p>other, the list returned by the Recorder is not void or a nul-
</p>
<p>lity, but that it is defective. In order to make this a good
</p>
<p>ground of challenge, it must be put on the ground of fraud. I
</p>
<p>do not profess to be bound by extreme cases. We may suppose all
</p>
<p>the names in the revised list to have been omitted: on the other
</p>
<p>hand, we may suppose one or two names only to have been omitted.
</p>
<p>The great difficulty of allowing this is, because, before the book was
</p>
<p>formed, a mistake was made, and certain names were omitted from
</p>
<p>the jury list, all parties are to be deprived of a special jury from this
</p>
<p>Jury Book. Suppose, as has been stated in one of the books, a rat

</p>
<p>had eaten up one of these leaves, why, if the traversers' argument is
</p>
<p>true, the jurors' list would then be a nullity, and the Jurors' Book,
</p>
<p>framed from it, would be a nullity. These are monstrous proposi-
</p>
<p>tions, and I do not understand how we can place reliance in the argu-
</p>
<p>ment from which they flow. This Jurors' Book was made out accord-
</p>
<p>ing to the Statute, save this fraud of some person, or this omission ;
</p>
<p>and I cannot help stating, from all that I have heard, that it was an
</p>
<p>omission rather than a fraud. But, at all events, the Statute is pre-
</p>
<p>cise, that the Jurors' Book is the instrument by which the High
</p>
<p>Sheriff is to go, and by it alone. I am, therefore, of opinion with my
</p>
<p>Lord Chief Justice and my brother Burton, that we cannot go be-
</p>
<p>yond the Jurors' Book. There is no imputation on the Jurors' Book
</p>
<p>itself; it is admitted to be, and so I should collect from the words
</p>
<p>of the challenge, a fair and true copy of the general list. The impu-
</p>
<p>tation is only on the general list. I take the jurors' list to be the
</p>
<p>record. The Hijh Sheriff is not to take into consideration the man-
</p>
<p>45
</p>
<p>ner in which it was made up. I by no means say that the party is
</p>
<p>without remedy if he proceeds; but this I will say, that if we were
</p>
<p>right in refusing the motion, we are, a multo fortiori, right in refusing
</p>
<p>the challenge. I can conceive the motion might be successful, in
</p>
<p>consequence of the misconduct of some specified person ; but when
</p>
<p>the Jurors' Book is brought before us, and we are told that this panel
</p>
<p>has been struck in such a manner that a trial cannot be had, the asser-
</p>
<p>tion is without foundation. There is an abundant number of names on
</p>
<p>the panel to form ajury,from which a fair trial may be obtained. It
</p>
<p>may be a hardship on the traversers, or it may be a hardship on the
</p>
<p>Crown,'but the principle of law is of universal application, that a par-
</p>
<p>ticular injury must give way to the general inconvenience. No par-
</p>
<p>ticular injury is pointed out; general inconvenience is pointed out,
</p>
<p>because, by pronouncing a judgment in favour of this challenge, we
</p>
<p>pronounce that there can be no valid trial, either by a special or a
</p>
<p>common jury, during the year 1844.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin.  I have carefully considered this Act of
</p>
<p>Parliament and its provisions since this motion has been before the
</p>
<p>Court, and in applying its provisions to the matter which appears on
</p>
<p>the challenge, I am under the disadvantage of coming to a different
</p>
<p>conclusion from my Lord Chief Justice and my brethren on the
</p>
<p>bench. I think, but not without considerable doubt, that this challenge
</p>
<p>ought to be allowed. By the Act, the collectors are to make out,
</p>
<p>in alphabetical order, true lists of all qualified persons within their
</p>
<p>districts, and to deliver them to the Clerk of the Peace, who shall
</p>
<p>keep them for public inspection for a certain time; special sessions
</p>
<p>are to be fixed for the purpose of revision and correction of the lists,
</p>
<p>by the insertion of proper persons, or the omission of improper per-
</p>
<p>sons, when every such list shall be fully corrected, by the Justices in
</p>
<p>the differentcountiesin Ireland, and the Recorder in the city of Dublin,
</p>
<p>and shall be allowed and signed by him or them ; and they, or one of
</p>
<p>them, shall cause a general list to be made out. I concur entirely
</p>
<p>in the distinction taken by my Lord Chief Justice between the judi-
</p>
<p>cial and ministerial duties of the Recorder, and 1 will say with him,

</p>
<p>that the judicial duties of the Recorder here end ; and I think that it
</p>
<p>so appears by reference to the case of the counties, for after the re-
</p>
<p>vision of the list by the Justices, the general list is not to be pre-
</p>
<p>pared by them. I should say that, so far, the proceedings of the
</p>
<p>Recorder ajfe strictly judicial, and so much so, that after he has, as
</p>
<p>judge, closed and allowed and signed the lists, he could himself make
</p>
<p>no alteration in it; andtherefore, I take it, his judicial duty then closes,
</p>
<p>and what remains for him to do is not to write with his own hand a ge-
</p>
<p>neral list, but to cause ageneral list to be made, containing the names
</p>
<p>of all those whose qualifications have been allowed, which isto beframed
</p>
<p>from the several lists sent by the collectors, upon which several adju-
</p>
<p>dications, revisions, and corrections have been made. It is the duty
</p>
<p>of the Justices and of the Recorder to cause a general list to be made
</p>
<p>of all qualified persons, arranged according to rank and property, and
</p>
<p>I should say, that if a mistake were made in that arrangement, that
</p>
<p>would be a matter upon which the Jurors' Book should not be im-
</p>
<p>46
</p>
<p>peached  a matter from which no appeal could be made. I will go
</p>
<p>further, and say that a casual mistake would not vitiate the list, and
</p>
<p>would not be incurable. The Act. then directs that the Recorder shall
</p>
<p>deliver the same, that is the general list of all whose qualifications
</p>
<p>have been allowed, and the Clerk of the Peace shall thereupon cause
</p>
<p>the same to be truly and fairly copied, in the same order, in a book
</p>
<p>to be by him provided for that purpose, at the expense of the county,
</p>
<p>city, and town respectively, &c. which book shall be called the Jurors'
</p>
<p>Book. Then the Statute provides, that every Jurors' Book so pre-
</p>
<p>pared shall be brought into use on the first of January after it is
</p>
<p>so delivered, and shall be used for a year. What does the chal-
</p>
<p>lenge say ? The challenge says, that after the Recorder had duly
</p>
<p>revised, examined, and corrected the parochial list, after he had
</p>
<p>signed it, he did not deliver a general list of all the names, arranged
</p>
<p>according to rank and property, but omitted to do so ; on the con-
</p>
<p>trary, that some person unknown, fraudulently, and, as alleged in
</p>
<p>some of the challenges, "to the prejudice of the traversers," made a
</p>
<p>list, omitting sixty names, purporting to be a general list, from which
</p>
<p>list the Jurors' Book was made out. Now, this is not an allegation
</p>
<p>that, by error or mistake in making out the list, some names were
</p>
<p>omitted accidentally. This is not a charge of an unintentional error,
</p>
<p>but it is a charge of intentional error, that some person did make a
</p>
<p>false list, omitting sixty names. The Attorney General very pro-
</p>
<p>perly insisted that matters not contravened or met in the challenge,
</p>
<p>must be taken to be admitted; and he insisted, I think, justly, that
</p>
<p>he was at liberty to take them as admitted. But it must be con-
</p>
<p>sidered, that there is a sufficient allegation that the Recorder handed
</p>
<p>in a list which was a defective list. The Recorder knew no more of
</p>
<p>it than I do ; and I think it would be monstrous to hold that a shadow
</p>
<p>of suspicion should alight upon him. There is nothing to warrant 
</p>
<p>nothing to suggest that he knew it; therefore, it must be taken that
</p>
<p>he was imposed on. Then what is the result of that? Is that the
</p>
<p>general list authenticated by the Recorder ? Is it to be taken to be
</p>
<p>the act of the Recorder, and that he is giving it as a voucher of the

</p>
<p>correctness of what he hands in ? He is merely a ministerial officer
</p>
<p>in that case, no more answerable for it than the person by whom he
</p>
<p>sends it ; and, in my mind, it is indifferent whether he hands it in
</p>
<p>himself, or whether he was ignorant of the omission. But how does
</p>
<p>that affect the materiality of the question? The evil to the parties
</p>
<p>who want a full jury list is as great as if the Recorder or the Justices
</p>
<p>were conusant of it. It appears to me that this challenge amounts
</p>
<p>to an allegation, that this was not, in truth, a general list, made from
</p>
<p>the other lists, which it ought to be, in order to constitute a founda-
</p>
<p>tion for a Jurors' Book. It has been observed, that the Act of Par-
</p>
<p>liament was framed with great accuracy  that the important object
</p>
<p>was to secure unbiassed jurors, and to leave as little as possible in the
</p>
<p>power of any particular officer. If we hold, then, that an alteration of
</p>
<p>this kind, made by a person who must be doing his duty in
</p>
<p>the employment of the public  if a contrivance of this sort is
</p>
<p>to be incurable, and is not to vitiate the act, which purports
</p>
<p>47
</p>
<p>to be the act of the Judge or superior officer, I cannot understand
</p>
<p>what security there is for the purity of the Jurors' Book. If the
</p>
<p>correct one may be mutilated, another one may be substituted. I can-
</p>
<p>not imagine that the mere fact of being received from the hands of the
</p>
<p>officer, from the Justices, or the Recorder, should constitute the real
</p>
<p>foundation of the list from which the Jurors' Book is to be made. It,
</p>
<p>seems to me, and perhaps this is as good a place to mention it as any
</p>
<p>other, that if such a thing were practised, and came to the ear of the
</p>
<p>Recorder, he would have a right to go with the real list, and call on the
</p>
<p>Sheriff to repudiate the fabricated list, and to correct the Jurors' Book
</p>
<p>according to the truth. It strikes me, that not only he would have that
</p>
<p>power, but that it would be his duty to do so. Suppose the Sheriff,
</p>
<p>in framing his special jury list, had marked off the names for his
</p>
<p>clerk to write, and that some of those names had been omitted by the
</p>
<p>clerk, and that the special jury list was framed, with the omission of
</p>
<p>those names, and that that was not discovered until the forty-eight
</p>
<p>names were about to be drawn, it strikes me that that would be
</p>
<p>a good cause for challenge. On the same principle, suppose a nisi
</p>
<p>prius trial, for which the Sheriff returns a rf?sn'Hgtts to this Court, and
</p>
<p>that it was afterwards altered by a subordinate officer of the Court
</p>
<p>some weeks before the trial, and afterwards, when it went down to the
</p>
<p>country it was discovered, surely that would be a ground of
</p>
<p>challenge, although not for misconduct in the Sheriff. It is said,
</p>
<p>that this challenge is a novel one, but its novelty arose from
</p>
<p>this, that the Act was of recent date. Before it, the Sheriff was
</p>
<p>uncontrolled in his selection. He was called on to return a jury
</p>
<p>from the body of the county, or from the different districts,
</p>
<p>but he might return whom he pleased. Here is a provision,
</p>
<p>confining his selection to a particular list ; if that is vitiated, although
</p>
<p>the Sheriff is not a party to that, yet it appears to me to come within
</p>
<p>the principle on which challenge to the array rests, and upon which it
</p>
<p>was originally founded. Much has been said about the inconvenience
</p>
<p>that would arise from admitting the present challenge, although no
</p>
<p>case can be found in the books on the subject. It has been objected

</p>
<p>that great inconvenience would arise, if this challenge was held to be
</p>
<p>good. The Court is not to regard the consequences of its decision,
</p>
<p>except so far, that it should be cautious that those decisions are well
</p>
<p>founded, and act upon sound principles of law. We are to decide
</p>
<p>the law according to the best of our abilities, and if any public incon-
</p>
<p>venience should follow, that should be remedied by those who had
</p>
<p>power to make laws. But it strikes me, that the inconvenience ap-
</p>
<p>prehended has been described as more extensive than it really is, and
</p>
<p>that there is a power to correct the error, which was admitted to ex-
</p>
<p>ist in this particular case. I cannot see any objection to amend the
</p>
<p>book according to the true and real general list. These are the
</p>
<p>grounds on which I felt myself compelled to act, though not without
</p>
<p>considerable doubt, in coming to a different conclusion from my
</p>
<p>brethren.
</p>
<p>The demurrer was allowed.
</p>
<p>48
</p>
<p>TUESDAY, January 16th.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown then called on the traversers to appear;
</p>
<p>two of whom, Messrs. Barrett and Duffy, not answering to their
</p>
<p>names, Messrs. Cantwell and Gartlan, the attorneys concerned
</p>
<p>for them, stated they would he in court in a very short time, and
</p>
<p>that they, as acting on their behalf, assented to whatever should be
</p>
<p>done in their absence.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General.  My Lords, I am quite satisfied of the
</p>
<p>accuracy of what has been stated ; but I think in a case of this kind,
</p>
<p>every thing should be regular.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  In misdemeanor cases, is it not usual
</p>
<p>for traversers to appear by attorney ?
</p>
<p>The Attorney General.  That is only conceded ex gratia.
</p>
<p>But where the traversers enter into recognizance, they cannot
</p>
<p>appear by attorney, without the consent of the Crown, and it has
</p>
<p>been expressly so decided in England. There would be an obvious
</p>
<p>objection, if, for instance, any difficulty should arise as to the identity
</p>
<p>of any of the traversers in the progress of the trial.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  There should be a separate appearance entered for
</p>
<p>each of the traversers, by attorney. There is no objection in point
</p>
<p>of law to their appearing by attorney, and we shall undertake that
</p>
<p>they shall appear, if required.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General.  If that application had been originally
</p>
<p>made, I was prepared to show by authority, that they could not ap-
</p>
<p>pear by attorney. I shall certainly require their attendance during
</p>
<p>the trial.
</p>
<p>Messrs. Barrett and Duffy having come into Court,
</p>
<p>The following gentlemen were called, and answered to their
</p>
<p>names :
</p>
<p>James Hamilton.
</p>
<p>Edward Roper.
</p>
<p>Mr. Roper objected 10 serve, as his health was bad ; and also that
</p>
<p>he was not liable to serve as a juror, being seventy-two years of age.
</p>
<p>He handed in a document, certifying his inability to serve.

</p>
<p>Mr. Henn.  As Mr. Roper has been returned on the jury list,
</p>
<p>and made no objection to his being put on the list when the revision
</p>
<p>was going on, he cannot now object to serve.
</p>
<p>Mr. O' Connell  The document handed in by Mr. Roper is a
</p>
<p>declaration, and cannot be received by the Court.
</p>
<p>Mr. Macdonagh.  The Court decided yesterday, that the deci-
</p>
<p>sion of the Recorder was final; the party not having objected at tho
</p>
<p>time when it was competent for him to object, cannot now be ex-
</p>
<p>cused.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  Your argument is not ad idem to the
</p>
<p>present case. The observations were then made with respect to the
</p>
<p>array, not to the qualification of any particular juror.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice This gentleman is returned on the jury
</p>
<p>list, and I have heard nothing that would induce me to say that he
</p>
<p>49
</p>
<p>has established an excuse ; and I further think, unless some sufficient
</p>
<p>reason be shewn, the traversers have a right to insist that he should
</p>
<p>be sworn, and in my opinion he ought to be sworn.
</p>
<p>The following Jury were then sworn :
</p>
<p>James Hamilton. Henry Thompson.
</p>
<p>Edward Roper. Anson Floyd.
</p>
<p>Edward Clarke. John Rigby.
</p>

<p>The Clerk of the Crown then gave the traversers in charge.
</p>
<p>Mr. Napier  My Lords, and Gentlemen of the Jury. This is an
</p>
<p>indictment, charging the traversers with an unlawful conspiracy and
</p>
<p>confederacy, and contains eleven counts. The first count charges
</p>
<p>the traversers, first, with unlawfully intending and devising to raise
</p>
<p>and create discontent and disaffection amongst Her Majesty's sub-
</p>
<p>jects ; and secondly, to excite them to hatred and contempt of the
</p>
<p>government and constitution of this realm, as by law established ;
</p>
<p>thirdly, to excite hatred, jealousies, and ill-will amongst different
</p>
<p>classes, especially hostility and ill-will between Her Majesty's sub-
</p>
<p>jects in Ireland and in England ; fourthly, to create discontent and
</p>
<p>disaffection in the army ; fifthly, to cause and procure, and aid and
</p>
<p>assist in causing and procuring divers subjects of Her Majesty, un-
</p>
<p>lawfully and seditiously to meet and assemble at various times and
</p>
<p>places within Ireland, in order, by means of the intimidation to be
</p>
<p>thereby caused, and the exhibition and demonstration of great phy-
</p>
<p>sical force, to obtain changes and alterations in the government and
</p>
<p>constitution, as by law established ; and sixthly, to bring into disre-
</p>
<p>pute the courts by law established for the administration of justice,
</p>
<p>and to diminish the confidence of her Majesty's subjects therein, with
</p>
<p>intent to withdraw the adjudication of their differences therefrom, and
</p>
<p>to submit them to the adjudication of other tribunals, to be contrived
</p>
<p>and constituted for the purposes. It then sets out, as overt
</p>
<p>acts, in furtherance of these designs, meetings, speeches, and publi-

</p>
<p>cations.
</p>
<p>The second count is the same as the first, omitting the overt acts.
</p>
<p>The third count is the same as the second, except in the charge
</p>
<p>as to the procuring the meetings, the words " unlawfully and se-
</p>
<p>ditiously" are omitted.
</p>
<p>The fourth count omits the charge as to the army, and the overt
</p>
<p>acts.
</p>
<p>The fifth count is for a 'conspiracy, with intent to create disaf-
</p>
<p>fection, and to excite to hatred and contempt of the government and
</p>
<p>constitution, omitting the overt acts.
</p>
<p>The sixth count charges the intent to be by means of intimidation,
</p>
<p>and the demonstration of physical force to procure and effect changes
</p>
<p>in the government, omitting the overt acts.
</p>
<p>The seventh count is the same as the sixth, with this addition,
</p>
<p>that the changes to be effected were especially the dissolution of the
</p>
<p>legislative Union.
</p>
<p>50
</p>
<p>The eighth count charges a conspiracy, to bring into hatred and
</p>
<p>disrepute, the courts for the administration of justice, with the in-
</p>
<p>tent to induce her Majesty's subjects to withdraw the adjudication
</p>
<p>of their differences therefrom ; omitting the overt acts.
</p>
<p>The ninth count is the same as the eighth, with the addition of a
</p>
<p>charge to usurp the prerogative of the Crown in the establishment of
</p>
<p>those courts.
</p>
<p>The tenth count is the same as the eighth, omitting the intent.
</p>
<p>The eleventh count charges the causing and procuring large
</p>
<p>numbers to assemble, and by means of unlawful, seditious, and in-
</p>
<p>flammatory speeches and addresses, and by means of publishing, and
</p>
<p>procuring to be published, seditious writings, to intimidate the
</p>
<p>united Parliament, and thereby to effect changes in the laws and
</p>
<p>constitution of the realm.
</p>
<p>The traversers have pleaded not guilty.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General.  My Lords and Gentlemen of the Jury.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you have been empanelled in the present case, in order to
</p>
<p>perform the important duty of deciding upon the innocence or guilt
</p>
<p>of the several traversers, and I am sure it is not necessary to impress
</p>
<p>upon your minds the necessity of giving your anxious and undivided
</p>
<p>attention to this momentous case during its progress to its conclusion.
</p>
<p>My learned friend Mr. Napier has already stated to you the nature
</p>
<p>of the charge which has been brought forward by the officers of the
</p>
<p>Crown, against the several traversers; but the better to impress it
</p>
<p>on your minds, in order that you may be able to understand the case
</p>
<p>as it proceeds, I shall take leave again to call your attention to the
</p>
<p>general nature of the charges against the traversers. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>they stand indicted for having conspired and confederated together
</p>
<p>to raise and create discontent and disaffection amongst Her Majesty's
</p>
<p>subjects, and to excite them to hatred and contempt of the govern-
</p>
<p>ment and constitution of the realm as by law established, and to
</p>
<p>unlawful and seditious opposition to the said government  to create
</p>
<p>jealousy and ill-will among various classes of Her Majesty's sub-
</p>
<p>jects, especially to promote a feeling of ill-will and hostility to-

</p>
<p>wards Her Majesty's subjects in England  to excite discontent
</p>
<p>and disaffection in the army  to cause large numbers of persons
</p>
<p>to meet together at different times, and in different places, for the
</p>
<p>unlawful purpose of obtaining, by means of intimidation, and the
</p>
<p>demonstration of great physical force, changes to be made in the go-
</p>
<p>vernment of the country, as by law established, and, in particular, by
</p>
<p>these means to bring about a dissolution of the legislative Union
</p>
<p>between Great Britain and Ireland  by means of inflammatory
</p>
<p>speeches, addresses, and seditious publications to intimidate the Im-
</p>
<p>perial Parliament, and thereby bring about certain changes and alte-
</p>
<p>rations in this realm, as by law established  to excite hatred and
</p>
<p>distrust of the tribunals of the country, as by law established  to
</p>
<p>diminish the confidence of Her Majesty's subjects in the administra-
</p>
<p>tion of the law therein, and to usurp the prerogative of the Crown,
</p>
<p>in the establishment of courts for the administration of the law.
</p>
<p>Having thus brought under your notice the charges for which the
</p>
<p>51
</p>
<p>traversers stand indicted, 1 think it will be convenient, before I open
</p>
<p>the facts of the case, to make some observations relative to the law
</p>
<p>of conspiracy, to enable you to apply those observations as I pro-
</p>
<p>ceed with my statement of the case. But, Gentlemen of the Jury,
</p>
<p>you must be aware of this, that 1 do so under the correction of the
</p>
<p>Court ; you are not to take the statement of the law from me, or from
</p>
<p>the traversers' counsel conclusively, but so far only as it meets with the
</p>
<p>approbation of the Court. With respect then to the law of conspi-
</p>
<p>racy, I have to state to you that it is a crime which consists in the
</p>
<p>combination or agreement of more than one person, either to do an
</p>
<p>illegal act, or to effect a legal purpose by illegal means ; and a con-
</p>
<p>federacy to effect an illegal object, or even a perfectly legal object by
</p>
<p>illegal means, is, in the contemplation of the law, criminal, and
</p>
<p>amounts to the offence of conspiracy. My Lords, you will find it
</p>
<p>so laid down in the case of The King v. Jones, 4 B. & Ad. 349 ;
</p>
<p>and the same rule of law was also laid down in this Court in The
</p>
<p>King v. Forbes and others, Green's report, page 347, where it is
</p>
<p>said by Chief Justice Bushe, in giving the judgment of the Court.
</p>
<p>" The nature of a conspiracy is now to be described. It is defined
</p>
<p>" to be when two or more persons confederate together for the
</p>
<p>" effecting of an illegal purpose, or to effect a legal purpose by the
</p>
<p>" use of unlawful means, even although such purpose should never
</p>
<p>" be effected. The merely confederating constitutes the crime,
</p>
<p>" though the object be not effected." And in a more recent case of
</p>
<p>The Queens. Murphy, 8 Car. & Payne, 310, Mr. Justice Cole-
</p>
<p>ridge, in summing up to the jury, says : " You have been properly i
</p>
<p>" told, that this being a charge of conspiracy, if you are of opinion 1
</p>
<p>" that the acts, though done, were done without common consent ^
</p>
<p>" and design between these two parties, the present charge cannot be
</p>
<p>" supported. On the other hand, I am bound to tell you, that al-
</p>
<p>" though the common design is the root of the charge, it is not ne-
</p>
<p>" cessary to prove that these two parties came together, and actually
</p>
<p>" agreed in terms to have this common design, and to pursue it by
</p>
<p>" common means, and so to carry it into execution. This is not ne-

</p>
<p>" cessary, because, in many cases of the most clearly established
</p>
<p>" conspiracies, there are no means of proving any such thing, and
</p>
<p>" neither law nor common sense requires that it should be proved.
</p>
<p>" If you find that these two persons pursued by their acts the same
</p>
<p>" object, often by the same means, one performing one part of an
</p>
<p>" act, and the other another part of the same act, so as to complete
</p>
<p>" it, with a view to the attainment of the object which they were
</p>
<p>" pursuing, you will be at liberty to draw the conclusion, that they
</p>
<p>" have been engaged in a conspiracy to effect that object. The
</p>
<p>" question you have to ask yourselves is  had they this common de-
</p>
<p>" sign, and did they pursue it by these common means  the design s^
</p>
<p>" being unlawful?" He further says: " I ought also to tell you that
</p>
<p>M by finding the defendants guilty you will not (as has been said)
</p>
<p>" affect the right of petitioning. It is not wrongful to assemble in a
</p>
<p>" public meeting, to petition Parliament against that which is alleged
</p>
<p>" to be a public grievance ; neither is it unlawful to refuse payment
</p>
<p>52
</p>
<p>u of the church rate in money, and to leave the collector to obtain
</p>
<p>" payment, by taking the goods of the party, as is constantly done in
</p>
<p>" the case of the Quakers ; but it is unlawful, by means like those
</p>
<p>" charged in this indictment, to prevent these rates being levied on
</p>
<p>^ " the goods of the party. It is not necessary that it should be proved
</p>
<p>" that these defendants met to concoct this scheme, nor is it neces-
</p>
<p>" sary they should have originated it. If a conspiracy be already
</p>
<p>" formed, and a person joins it afterwards, he is equally guilty. You
</p>
<p>" are to say whether from the acts that have been proved, you are
</p>
<p>" satisfied that these defendants were acting in concert in this matter.
</p>
<p>" If you are satisfied that there was concert between them, lam
</p>
<p>" bound to say, that being convinced of the conspiracy, it is not ne-
</p>
<p>" cessary that you should find both Mr. Murphy and Mr. Douglas do-
</p>
<p>" ing each particular act, as after the fact of a conspiracy is once estab-
</p>
<p>" lished in your minds, whatever is either said or done by either of the
</p>
<p>" defendants, in pursuance of the common design, is, both in law
</p>
<p>y/ " and in common sense, to be considered as the act of both." Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen of the Jury, I tell you confidently that such is the law, and such
</p>
<p>always has been the law. If then, upon hearing the facts of the
</p>
<p>case, you believe that the several traversers have been engaged in
</p>
<p>the common design to obtain their object by the means alleged in
</p>
<p>the indictment, the moment you are of that opinion, the acts of
</p>
<p>one, or what was said or written by one, for scribere est agere, be-
</p>
<p>comes evidence against the other, as much as if he had written or done
</p>
<p>that particular thing. I have already stated in the opening of this
</p>
<p>case, if their design was, by confederating, to effectuate an illegal ob-
</p>
<p>ject, or a legal object by illegal means, they would be guilty of con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. With reference to this last proposition, my Lord, I would
</p>
<p>wish to call your attention to the case of the King v. Stone, 6 T. R.
</p>
<p>528. In Watson's case, reported in the 32nd vol. of the State Trials,
</p>
<p>page 7, Mr. Justice Bayley, in his charge to the Grand Jury, states
</p>
<p>the law in a case of high treason ; in that case a conspiracy to levy war
</p>
<p>was also included. That doctrine, as laid down by Mr. Justice Bayley,
</p>
<p>is applicable to the present case. He says : " He who plans the thing,
</p>

<p>\ " or who devises the means by which it is to be effected, or draws
</p>
<p>" in others to co-operate, or does any other act preparatory to the
</p>
<p>" execution of the thing proposed, is as much a principal as he who
</p>
<p>" executes that thing: and provided a man once comes into the com-
</p>
<p>" mon purpose and design, every previous act with a view to that
</p>
<p>" purpose and design, and every subsequent act, is as much his act
</p>
<p>" as if he had done it himself. If, therefore, you are satisfied that
</p>
<p>" any of those persons concurred in planning the thing, or concurred
</p>
<p>" in inciting others to engage in it, or engaged in it at a subsequent
</p>
<p>" period after it had been planned and devised by others, but came
</p>
<p>" into it for the purpose of carrying it into effect ; provided you shall
</p>
<p>" find that they all had the same common purpose and design, no
</p>
<p>u matter when any one person entered into that common purpose or
</p>
<p>" design, every one who did enter into it is, in law, a party to every
</p>
<p>" act which had been before done by the others, and a party to
</p>
<p>" every act which might be afterwards done by any of the others ;
</p>
<p>53
</p>
<p>' and therefore, what you will have to consider, with reference to
</p>
<p>' each person, will be this ;  did such person at any period of time
</p>
<p>'join in this common purpose? If he did, whether he were present'
</p>
<p>' at any particular meeting or not ; whether he were present at the
</p>
<p>time when the rising took place or not ; if he were party to the
</p>
<p>common purpose, that would make him equally guilty, as if he had
</p>
<p>' been actually present at every one of the acts and deliberations
</p>
<p>which will be brought under your consideration." He further says,
</p>
<p>' I omitted to state to you, that amongst the overt acts you will pro-
</p>
<p>' bably find conspiring will be one of the subjects charged, and con.
</p>
<p>' suiting another. In order to support these, it is not absolutely
</p>
<p>necessary that you should have positive evidence from persons who
</p>
<p>' heard them consult, or from persons who heard them conspire, or
</p>
<p>even that you should have evidence of an actual meeting for that
</p>
<p>purpose ; if you shall find that there was a plan, and you shall be
</p>
<p>' satisfied from what was done, that there must have been previous
</p>
<p>' consultation and conspiracy, either by the persons who are the ob-
</p>
<p>' jects of the charge, or by persons engaged with them in the same
</p>
<p>' common purpose and design, that will justify your finding the coii-
</p>
<p>' spiracy and consultation." That being the general law relating to
</p>
<p>conspiracy, so far as it is necessary to advert to it, I now come to
</p>
<p>the case of The Queen v. Vincent, 9 C. & P. 275. I may observe, that
</p>
<p>the indictment in that case was much the same as the present; it
</p>
<p>charged that the defendants did conspire to excite discontent and
</p>
<p>disaffection in the minds of the liege subjects of Her Majesty, and to
</p>
<p>excite them to hatred and contempt of the government and con-
</p>
<p>stitution of the realm, and to unlawful and seditious opposition
</p>
<p>to such government ; and it was proved that persons complained
</p>
<p>of having been alarmed by those meetings. Upon this indict-
</p>
<p>ment the defendants were found guilty, and that was an indict-
</p>
<p>ment to excite discontent and disaffection in the minds of Her
</p>
<p>Majesty's subjects, and to create contempt for the government,
</p>
<p>and unlawful opposition to it, which is a portion of the charge in
</p>
<p>the present case. There is another case reported in the 25th vol. of

</p>
<p>the State Trials, 1004, The King v. Redhead, otherwise Yorke, to which
</p>
<p>I shall call the attention of the Court. That was an indictment, " that
</p>
<p>" the defendant did, with other persons, unlawfully, maliciously, and
</p>
<p>" seditiously combine, conspire, and confederate with each other, to
</p>
<p>" traduce, vilify, and defame the Commons House of Parliament,
</p>
<p>" and the government of this realm, and to excite a spirit of discon-
</p>
<p>" tent and disaffection in the subjects of the King, towards the King
</p>
<p>" and the government of the realm ; and that he and the other conspira-
</p>
<p>" tors, in pursuance of the said unlawful combination and conspiracy,
</p>
<p>" did cause and procure divers subjects of the King, to the number
</p>
<p>" of 4000 and more, to meet and assemble themselves together, for
</p>
<p>" the purpose of hearing divers scandalous, seditious, and inflam-
</p>
<p>" matory speeches, resolutions, and writings, of and concerning the
</p>
<p>" Commons House of Parliament, and that they did propose, pub-
</p>
<p>" lish, and read to the said subjects, the said scandalous, seditious,
</p>
<p>" and inflammatory speeches, for the purpose of traducing and vilify-
</p>
<p>54
</p>
<p>" ing the said Commons House of Parliament." In that case, the
</p>
<p>defendant was convicted, and Mr. Justice Rooke in pages 1151-1153,
</p>
<p>in charging the jury, said: "you are therefore to consider, supposing
</p>
<p>" the inuendoes fairly stated, whether it was their intention merely
</p>
<p>" to enlighten the minds of the people upon a speculative point, or to
</p>
<p>" carry them a step further, and excite a spirit of discontent, disaffec-
</p>
<p>" tion, and sedition in their minds. If you should be of opinion, that
</p>
<p>" the defendant uttered these speeches with that view, or that they
</p>
<p>" had that tendency, even though he might not have that de-
</p>
<p>" sign, yet if a man will, in a public assembly, utter words having a
</p>
<p>" seditious tendency, he must take the consequences, and he can, in my
</p>
<p>" opinion, no more justify himself for what he has done, by saying
</p>
<p>" he did not think it would have that consequence, than a man who
</p>
<p>" should fire a pistol among a crowd should be allowed to say, 'I did
</p>
<p>" not think my pistol would have gone so far ;' or that a man should
</p>
<p>" be allowed to say, ' 1 did not think it would have killed the man.' "
</p>
<p>And he further observes : " He supported his speculative principles
</p>
<p>" of annual parliaments and universal suffrage, and says he has ut-
</p>
<p>" tered no more than what may be found in the speeches of such
</p>
<p>" men as the late Lord Chatham, Lord Camden, Sir George Saville,
</p>
<p>" Archdeacon Paley, and others ; and it is very true they have done
</p>
<p>" so ; and if the conduct of the defendant here had been merely a
</p>
<p>" speculation of his own, it would have been a different thing ; but
</p>
<p>" when those speculations are gone forth in a large assembly, it will
</p>
<p>" be for you to judge whether you will give him credit for the inno-
</p>
<p>" cence of his exertions ; whether he did not address them with a view
</p>
<p>" to inflame their minds and their passions." I think it advisable to call
</p>
<p>your Lordships' attention to a very important case. I shall beg leave to
</p>
<p>call the attention both of your Lordshipsand the jury to it, as bearing
</p>
<p>upon the subject of unlawful assemblies, because, as the law is there laid
</p>
<p>down, I think it will be found to displace a portion of what I anticipate
</p>
<p>will be the defence in the present case. It is the case of Bedford \.
</p>
<p>Birley and others, reported in the third volume of Starkie's Nisi Prius
</p>
<p>Cases, page 76. That, my Lords, was an action of trespass,

<p>brought against certain persons engaged in dispersing the Manchester
</p>
<p>meeting, Pleas of justification were put in by the defendants, which
</p>
<p>your Lordships will find in a note to the case, but it is not necessary
</p>
<p>now to allude to them, as you will find them referred to by the
</p>
<p>Judges in giving judgment. The case having come on for trial be-
</p>
<p>fore Mr. Justice Holroyd, and a verdict having been found for the
</p>
<p>defendants, establishing those pleas of justification and the illegality
</p>
<p>of the meeting, at the ensuing term a motion was made for a new
</p>
<p>trial, and the case came on for argument before Lord Tenterden,
</p>
<p>then Chief Justice Abbott, Justices Bayley, Holroyd, and the pre-
</p>
<p>sent Lord Wynford, and the Court unanimously refused to set aside
</p>
<p>the verdict, thereby establishing the law as laid down by Mr. Justice
</p>
<p>Holroyd at the trial; and each of the Judges, in delivering judgment
</p>
<p>on the motion for a new trial, gave their opinion with regard to
</p>
<p>the unlawfulness of assemblies of this multitudinous character. The
</p>
<p>judgments are given in a note to the case, and I will read for your
</p>
<p>55
</p>
<p>Lordships some passages from these judgments, which refer to the
</p>
<p>present matter. In page 99, Mr. Justice Holroyd at the trial
</p>
<p>stated :  " There is likewise another plea, which has let in a great
</p>
<p>" deal of evidence, viz., that there was a previous seditious conspi-
</p>
<p>** racy, to excite discontent amongst the King's subjects, entered into
</p>
<p>" by divers seditious persons, for the purpose of exciting disaffection
</p>
<p>" and hatred, and contempt of the government and constitution, as
</p>
<p>" by law established, and by unlawful means and combinations to al-
</p>
<p>" ter the government and constitution of the realm. And then in
</p>
<p>" one of the pleas, the drillings are alleged, which are stated to be
</p>
<p>" clandestine. But whether they were clandestine or not, if they
</p>
<p>" were done for the purpose of overawing the government, or for
</p>
<p>" the purpose of exciting tumult or resistance to the civil power, they
</p>
<p>" would be unlawful." And in page 103, the same judge, citing
</p>
<p>the opinion of Mr. Justice Bayley, who had tried the case of Rex
</p>
<p>v. Hunt, a case arising out of the same meeting, in giving judgment
</p>
<p>in that case, said : " All persons assembled to sow sedition, and
</p>
<p>" bring into contempt the constitution, are in an unlawful assembly;
</p>
<p>" all persons assembled in furtherance of this object are unlawfully
</p>
<p>" assembled too ;" and in the next page he says, also quoting the
</p>
<p>language of Mr. Justice Bayley: "what are the objects of the leader,
</p>
<p>" the person who means to occupy the chair,  the persons intending
</p>
<p>"to take distinguished parts in it? what are the objects of those
</p>
<p>" who bear the flags or banners ?  those are to be considered with re-
</p>
<p>ference to the inscriptions; what are the objects of those who
</p>
<p>" have been drilled? If the object of the drilling is to secure the
</p>
<p>" attention of the persons drilled, to disaffected speeches, and give
</p>
<p>" confidence, by an appearance of strength, to those willing to
</p>
<p>"join them, that would be illegal; or if they were to say, 'we
</p>
<p>" will have what we want, whether it is agreeable to law or not ;'
</p>
<p>" a meeting for that purpose, however it may be masked, if it is
</p>
<p>" really for a purpose of that kind, would be illegal." I should
</p>
<p>have stated to your Lordship, that the motion for a new trial was
</p>
<p>on several grounds, independently of the objection in point of law ;

</p>
<p>among others, that the verdict was against evidence. In page
</p>
<p>112, Lord Tenterden, in giving judgment, stated: "If all that was
</p>
<p>"legitimate evidence, a fortiori, the conduct of persons probably
</p>
<p>" and apparently going towards the meeting, would most undoubt-
</p>
<p>" edly be evidence ; for it is by such evidence only, you are able to
</p>
<p>" discover that which, though not the professed, was the real object
</p>
<p>"of the meeting. Doubtless, in an assembly of this kind, many
</p>
<p>" persons would go from different motives : some would go from
</p>
<p>" mere curiosity; there would be others who would think that there
</p>
<p>" were public grievances, which a meeting of this description might
</p>
<p>" prevent ; others might go, meditating mischief immediately ;" and
</p>
<p>I now pray your Lordships' attention to what follows : " others,"
</p>
<p>observed the learned Judge, " might go there, who meditated mis-
</p>
<p>" chief at some future time, when those drilled, who, up to this
</p>
<p>" period had been without arms, might have arrived at a further
</p>
<p>" stage in military discipline." You will be told that, forsooth, these
</p>
<p>56
</p>
<p>meetings dispersed peaceably. The peaceable separation of those
</p>
<p>meetings  the intention that they should disperse peaceably, is
</p>
<p>one of the most formidable parts of this conspiracy. The meet-
</p>
<p>ing was to disperse peaceably, because the time had not arrived.
</p>
<p>In the language of one of the traversers: "England's infirmity
</p>
<p>was to be Ireland's opportunity ;" and the same traverser asked
</p>
<p>the assembly : " Will you be ready to come again when I call
</p>
<p>you ; I know you will : but you must wait till the time arrives."
</p>
<p>If that course had not been adopted, the conspiracy would have
</p>
<p>broken up at an earlier period ; but part of the system was to have
</p>
<p>the organization complete, from east to west, from north to
</p>
<p>south, before the signal should be given ; therefore, those meet-
</p>
<p>ings peaceably dispersed. Thus, as Lord Tenterden said, persons
</p>
<p>might go to those meetings who meditated mischief at some future
</p>
<p>time, when those drilled might have arrived at a further stage
</p>
<p>in military discipline. In page 113, the noble Lord said: " When
</p>
<p>" we consider that these country people came marching in this
</p>
<p>" way, through the town of Manchester, bearing flags and ban-
</p>
<p>" ners inscribed with mottoes, not merely containing high-sounding
</p>
<p>" words, but inscriptions of No com laws ! Better die like freemen
</p>
<p>" than be sold like slaves ! and various other expressions of defiance ;
</p>
<p>" it is manifest that there was an avowed intention to insult those
</p>
<p>" who were intrusted with the administration of justice and the
</p>
<p>" laws ; and if possible, by a show of numbers, to overawe and pre-
</p>
<p>" vent them from interfering with the object their leader might be
</p>
<p>" supposed to have had." Lord Tenterden having given judgment,
</p>
<p>was followed by Judge Bayley, who, in page 116, says: " It appears
</p>
<p>" by the evidence in the case, that the meeting was composed of an
</p>
<p>" immense number of persons ; a very large portion therefore of
</p>
<p>" physical strength. It appears on the evidence in the case that
</p>
<p>" there was an elevation, from which elevation persons would have
</p>
<p>" the opportunity of making speeches ; and it appeared also, that
</p>
<p>" amongst other persons, there was one who had no particular con-
</p>
<p>" nexion with the place, and who had come from a considera-

</p>
<p>" ble distance, for the purpose of speaking, and for the purpose
</p>
<p>" of communicating his sentiments to that large body of people,
</p>
<p>" which was assembled at that place ; and he might, by the in-
</p>
<p>" timations which he there made, give to the physical force so
</p>
<p>" assembled, a direction which might operate in perfect innocence,
</p>
<p>" or with a degree of danger to the public peace. It appeared, that
</p>
<p>" before that period, it was notorious that he had been at another
</p>
<p>" public meeting, at which public meeting there had been certain re-
</p>
<p>" solutions passed. At that time, then, you are to judge what the
</p>
<p>" language will be which he will make use of at the place, where
</p>
<p>" there is that large collection of physical strength, which may re-
</p>
<p>" ceive a direction from him ; what is likely to be the direction which
</p>
<p>" he may be disposed to give it." And are we to be told, or is it
</p>
<p>consistent with the law, as these learned judges have laid it down, that
</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands of people may assemble, whose course of pro-
</p>
<p>ceeding is to be regulated by the directions of one individual, who
</p>
<p>may tell them to separate peaceably, who might do so to further
</p>
<p>57
</p>
<p>the design of the conspiracy, and hecause the organization was not yet
</p>
<p>complete, to enable him to withdraw the mask which concealed his
</p>
<p>design. They separated peaceably, but they were controlled by one
</p>
<p>man, and that man might have given them either one direction or
</p>
<p>the other. I say, therefore, that these meetings were inconsistent with
</p>
<p>the law of the laud, and I shall ever hold that opinion, until I hear the
</p>
<p>contrary laid down positively from the Bench. In page 125 of the
</p>
<p>same Report, Lord Wynford, in delivering judgment, said, " It ap-
</p>
<p>" pears to me impossible to say this drilling was innocent. If it was
</p>
<p>" not innocent, what was it? We have the key to it in the evidence
</p>
<p>" of the witnesses, that though nothing was to be done at this meeting,
</p>
<p>" yet when their numbers were seen, others would join them, and
</p>
<p>" they should be then enabled to overturn the government." And
</p>
<p>you will hear it laid down, that these meetings and that this confede-
</p>
<p>racy, which I trace to the Association in Dublin, for the purpose of
</p>
<p>organizing the population against the law, because they were peace-
</p>
<p>able, and peaceable only according to the determination of one
</p>
<p>man, were consistent with the law and constitution. In page 126,
</p>
<p>the same learned judge continues: "It is not necessary, for the
</p>
<p>" purpose of showing it was illegal, to decide whether immediate
</p>
<p>" mischief was to be then begun. I believe many went there with-
</p>
<p>" out that intention ; but I have so much experience in matters of
</p>
<p>" this sort, that 1 have known this occur, that those who follow are
</p>
<p>" more in a hurry for execution than those who plan. I think,
</p>
<p>" therefore, it is most probable that that which I have stated is cor-
</p>
<p>" rect, at least as far as regards the intention of the leaders. Nothing
</p>
<p>" mischievous was to be done that day ; they were only to ascertain
</p>
<p>" the numbers ; to accustom them to meet in large parties ; to in-
</p>
<p>" spire mutual confidence; to incite others, by the great numbers
</p>
<p>" they presented, to join in the scheme of those who had embarked
</p>
<p>" themselves ; and at some future day, when the drilling should be
</p>
<p>" more advanced, when, as was said by one of my learned brothers,
</p>
<p>" they should have a trifling addition made to their discipline, by
</p>
<p>u having arms put into their hands, then the mischief was finally to

</p>
<p>" be entered upon." Such, then, was the law laid down by Lord
</p>
<p>Tenterden, Mr. Justice Bayley, Mr. Justice Holroyd, and Lord Wyn-
</p>
<p>ford. I shall only advert to one more authority on this subject, before I
</p>
<p>proceed to state the facts of this case. The case I allude to is reported
</p>
<p>in 9 Car. & Payne, 460, The Queen v. Collins ; in that case, Mr.
</p>
<p>Justice Littledale says: " With respect to the second resolution, it is
</p>
<p>" no sedition to say, that the people of Birmingham had a right to
</p>
<p>" meet in the Bull-ring, or any where else; but you are to consider
</p>
<p>" whether the words, that they are bent judges of their own power
</p>
<p>" and resources to obtain justice , meant the regular mode of proceed-
</p>
<p>" ing, by presenting petitions to the Crown or either House of Par-
</p>
<p>" liament, or by publishing a declaration of grievances ; or whether
</p>
<p>" they meant that the people should make use of physical force, as
</p>
<p>" their own resource to obtain justice, and meant to excite the
</p>
<p>" people to take the power into their own hands, and meant to ex-
</p>
<p>" cite them to tumult and disorder." That, my Lords, was a case of
</p>
<p>i
</p>
<p>58
</p>
<p>far less enormity than the present, although the defendants were there
</p>
<p>found guilty, and will make the authority of it more strikingly applica-
</p>
<p>ble to the present case. I shall trouble your Lordship with but one
</p>
<p>more case, that is the case of The King v. JBurdett, 4 B. & Aid.
</p>
<p>178, where Lord Tenterden, in giving judgment, says, " In the King
</p>
<p>" v. Solves and others, the trial proceeded on this principle, when
</p>
<p>" no proof of actual conspiracy, embracing all the several conspira-
</p>
<p>" tors, was attempted to be given, in Middlesex, where the trial took
</p>
<p>" place, and where the individual actings of some of the conspirators
</p>
<p>" were wholly confined to other counties than Middlesex ; but still
</p>
<p>" the conspiracy, as against all, having been proved, from the com-
</p>
<p>" munity of criminal purpose, and by their joint co-operation in for-
</p>
<p>" warding the objects of it in different places and counties ; the locality
</p>
<p>" required for the purpose of trial was holden to be satisfied by
</p>
<p>" overt acts done by some of them, in prosecution of the conspiracy,
</p>
<p>" in the county where the trial was had." That case illustrates the
</p>
<p>principle I took the liberty of adverting to, in the last part of my
</p>
<p>statement, that the act of one conspirator engaged with others in one
</p>
<p>common design, is in point of law the act of all, because, for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of venue, an overt act done by one in the county in which the
</p>
<p>indictment was laid, is, in contemplation of law, the act of all. You
</p>
<p>may rely on it as evidence of a conspiracy by all, at the place where
</p>
<p>the venue is laid.
</p>
<p>Having now called the attention of your Lordships shortly to
</p>
<p>the law applicable to a great portion of this case, except one branch
</p>
<p>of it, which I shall allude to hereafter, I shall now proceed, gentle-
</p>
<p>men of the jury, to open to you the facts of this momentous case.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I think it convenient, however, before I do so, to ad-
</p>
<p>vert very shortly to the position in which the question of the repeal
</p>
<p>of the Union stood at the time of the constitution of the Repeal
</p>
<p>Association in Dublin. Shortly after the passing of the Roman
</p>
<p>Catholic Relief Bill, which, as your Lordships know, received the
</p>
<p>royal assent in 1829, an association was formed in this city, which
</p>
<p>changed its name on various occasions with a view of evading the

</p>
<p>law, having in contemplation a repeal of the legislative Union.
</p>
<p>Having that for its object, and there being a Statute then in force,
</p>
<p>which has since expired, the then Government, at the head of which
</p>
<p>was Lord Grey, issued a proclamation in January, 1831, suppressing
</p>
<p>this Association, stating, that the Association was an assembly as-
</p>
<p>suming various denominations, and that they had assembled and
</p>
<p>held meetings from time to time, for the purpose of promulgating
</p>
<p>seditious doctrines, and by means of inflammatory language to excite
</p>
<p>and keep alive a spirit of disaffection and hostility to the existing
</p>
<p>law ; and further stating, that those meetings were dangerous to
</p>
<p>the public peace, and inconsistent with the due administration of the
</p>
<p>law. Gentlemen, as I have already said, at this time a Statute was
</p>
<p>in force, giving a stronger power to the Government than they now
</p>
<p>possess, and that was passed by the Government of which Lord Grey
</p>
<p>was the head. In the course of the same year, a question was put
</p>
<p>in the House of Commons, to Lord Althorp, then a minister of the
</p>
<p>59
</p>
<p>Crown, relating to the repeal of the Union ; he then stated the views
</p>
<p>of the Government with respect to it, thus : " The Hon. member
</p>
<p>" for Waterford has, as it is well known, been exciting so much dis-
</p>
<p>" content and disaffection in Ireland, and was keeping up so much
</p>
<p>" agitation in that country, by speeches, which, though concluding
</p>
<p>" with an advice to be obedient to the laws, it was evident to any
</p>
<p>*' unprejudiced man who read" them, or marked the course which the
</p>
<p>" honourable gentleman was pursuing, that his language and conduct
</p>
<p>*' were evidently intended, and must have the effect of exciting an
</p>
<p>" insurrection throughout the country. His avowed object was, to
</p>
<p>" obtain a repeal of the legislative Union ; but he would ask any
</p>
<p>" man who considered what such a repeal must produce ; whether it
</p>
<p>" did not become the duty of the government to use every means in
</p>
<p>"' their power for the suppression of such conduct, and the punish-
</p>
<p>" ment of the man who pursued it? Is it not evident that the repeal
</p>
<p>" of the legislative Union must produce a seperation of the two
</p>
<p>" countries ? I trust that those engaged in so dangerous a course
</p>
<p>" to the peace and prosperity of the country will not succeed, and if
</p>
<p>" they do, it must be by a successful war, and I know too much of
</p>
<p>" my countrymen to believe such an event to be possible. I have a
</p>
<p>" horror of all description of war, but particularly a civil war, which
</p>
<p>" is most to be dreaded and abhorred ; but I think a civil war is pre-
</p>
<p>" ferable to the dismemberment of the empire." That was the posi-
</p>
<p>tion in which the repeal question stood in 1831 ; that was the opinion
</p>
<p>entertained by the then English government, and by Lord Althorp,
</p>
<p>who was then a leading member of it ; and this is of importance in
</p>
<p>considering the course they have adopted to carry out their object,
</p>
<p>which I shall show is not consistent with the law and the consti-
</p>
<p>tution ; and before I close this case, I will prove out of the mouths
</p>
<p>of some of the traversers, that their object was to obtain a re-
</p>
<p>peal of the Union, otherwise than by legal and constitutional means.
</p>
<p>This is not the first time that persons have been found to preach
</p>
<p>peace when they intend the contrary ; for, as we find in the 31
</p>
<p>State Trials, page 98, it has been well observed by Mr. Justice

</p>
<p>Grose, in passing sentence, " that men, with rebellion in their
</p>
<p>" hearts, occasionally use words like you, recommending peace, or-
</p>
<p>" der, tranquillity, and obedience to the law ;" and they do so with
</p>
<p>an obvious purpose, because, if they did not continue to do so up
</p>
<p>to that point where they may venture to throw off the mask,
</p>
<p>it would defeat their own designs; they must therefore preach
</p>
<p>peace and tranquillity, until they have wound up the public mind,
</p>
<p>until they can tell the people now "is the time, the period has ar-
</p>
<p>rived in which you may carry out your object." The effect of this
</p>
<p>proclamation, and the strong opinion expressedby the government, was
</p>
<p>to give a temporary check to repeal agitation; but the moment the
</p>
<p>Act had expired, the agitation was recommenced, the repeal of the
</p>
<p>Union was again brought forward, and in the commencement of the
</p>
<p>session of 1833, His late Majesty, in his speech on the opening of
</p>
<p>Parliament, desired to be furnished with additional powers for con-
</p>
<p>trolling the disturbers of the public peace in Ireland,, and strength-
</p>
<p>60
</p>
<p>ening the legislative Union between the two countries. That was ad-
</p>
<p>dressed to the Parliament in the commencement of the session of
</p>
<p>1833, and in moving the address, Lord John Russell, then a minister
</p>
<p>of the Crown, stated : " can you say that the object is not a separation
</p>
<p>" between the two countries, when all that has lately passed in Ire-
</p>
<p>" land shows, that the object is nothing more or less than an attempt,
</p>
<p>" under the name of a repeal of the Union, to disunite the two coun-
</p>
<p>" tries  to confiscate the property of Englishmen, who have property
</p>
<p>" there  to overturn at once the united Parliament, and to establish
</p>
<p>" instead of the King, Lords and Commons of the united kingdom,
</p>
<p>" some parliament of which Mr. O'Connell was to be the leader and
</p>
<p>" chief;" and on the same night, another minister of the Crown said :
</p>
<p>" 1 told the honourable gentleman that which I now emphatically
</p>
<p>" repeat, namely, that the question of the repeal of the Union is the
</p>
<p>" question of separation between England and Ireland, and that the
</p>
<p>" question of separation involves the question of the destruction of
</p>
<p>" the British Monarchy, and the establishment in Ireland of a fero-
</p>
<p>" cious republic of the worst kind;" and the late Lord Lieutenant
</p>
<p>of Ireland said : "that although he had the greatest horror of a civil
</p>
<p>war, yet he would prefer it to a repeal of the Union." The result
</p>
<p>of that debate was the introduction of what is commonly called the
</p>
<p>Coercion Act, an Act renewing and giving more power to the execu-
</p>
<p>tive than they possessed under the Statute 10 Geo. IV., under which
</p>
<p>the proclamation of 1833 was issued ; the effect of that Act was to
</p>
<p>suspend (he agitation of repeal in this country.
</p>
<p>One of the traversers, Mr. Daniel O'Connell, brought forward a
</p>
<p>motion in the House of Commons, in 1834, in favour of a repeal of
</p>
<p>the Union, upon which occasion one of the then ministers of the
</p>
<p>Crown moved an amendment to the address to the throne, to declare
</p>
<p>the fixed determination of the Parliament to maintain, unimpaired and
</p>
<p>undisturbed, the legislative Union. On the occasion of that address,
</p>
<p>Lord Monteagle made a celebrated and powerful speech, and the
</p>
<p>amendment was carried by a majority of 523 to 38. The result of
</p>
<p>the debate was, that it, in conjunction with the Coercion Act, did sus-

</p>
<p>pend the agitation of the repeal of the Union for a short time. The
</p>
<p>next step to keep this unhappy country in a state of agitation was, to
</p>
<p>establish another of those associations, which, whatever name they
</p>
<p>have had, still had the same object in view. It was formed in the
</p>
<p>year 1836, the Coercion Act having expired, and it was called the
</p>
<p>" General Association," having, as part of its constitution, that which
</p>
<p>has always been found to be a part of the system, the collection of
</p>
<p>what was called justice-rent, a portion of the money of which the poor
</p>
<p>inhabitants of this country have been, from time to time, defrauded,
</p>
<p>and which has been spent in a way that nobody knows, or has ever
</p>
<p>heard; and it is only astonishing how the inhabitants of this country
</p>
<p>could have been deluded into having money extorted from them,
</p>
<p>and never being informed how it was spent. This society continued
</p>
<p>up to 1838 ; then was formed the Precursor Association. It conti-
</p>
<p>nued to collect and spend money, in carrying on the same system of
</p>
<p>agitation which has been the curse of this country. You might as
</p>
<p>til
</p>
<p>well expect the natural body to be in a state of health, when operated
</p>
<p>on by excessive stimulants, as to expect this country to be in a state
</p>
<p>of tranquillity and happiness, with this constant agitation carried on
</p>
<p>from year to year. I have now brought the facts of this case down
</p>
<p>to the period of the institution of the present association. This asso-
</p>
<p>ciation was formed in the month of February, 1840, it changed its
</p>
<p>name twice, and assumed its present name " The Loyal National Re-
</p>
<p>peal Association," in July, 1840.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the jury, it becomes necessary for me now to bring
</p>
<p>before you the general nature and constitution of this Association. It
</p>
<p>consists of Associates, Members, and Volunteers ; the class of asso-
</p>
<p>ciates was established with this view, to have some portion of those
</p>
<p>connected with it liable to pay a small subscription only, in order to
</p>
<p>extend the organization throughout the country, and to organize as
</p>
<p>far as might be the poorer classes of the country. Accordingly the
</p>
<p>associate pays only one shilling, and a card is given him, which
</p>
<p>answers all the purposes, without coming within the express language
</p>
<p>of the act against pass-words and signs. It enables him to show that
</p>
<p>he was connected with the Association, and thus the people have the
</p>
<p>means of knowing who are connected with this Association. This
</p>
<p>card which I hold in my hand has a shamrock at the top, with the
</p>
<p>words "Protestant" "Catholic" and "Dissenter "  " quis separabit"
</p>
<p> and at the bottom a view of the Bank of Ireland, formerly the
</p>
<p>Parliament house, and the words " It was and shall be" The next
</p>
<p>class in that association are those called Members,  the lower class,
</p>
<p>the Associates, pay one shilling, the members are to pay twenty
</p>
<p>shillings each, or if an associate take the trouble to collect twenty
</p>
<p>shillings that entitles him to be a member, as well as if he had paid
</p>
<p>the money himself. To each of those members a card is issued, to
</p>
<p>which I shall call your attention. On one corner of this card is
</p>

<p>bers to whom this card was issued might not be perfectly aware of
</p>
<p>the object for which it was contrived, or understand the meaning of
</p>
<p>those names, a printed explanation was issued which had been adopted
</p>
<p>by the Association to point out why these four names were selected.
</p>
<p>They are the scites of battles fought in which the Irish had been
</p>
<p>successful, and either the Danes, or the English, or as the defendants
</p>
<p>call them, the Saxon foreigners, were defeated by the Irish. This is
</p>
<p>the association preaching peace and tranquillity ; this is the association
</p>
<p>which never thought of exciting discontent or disaffection between
</p>
<p>different classes of her Majesty's subjects ; that card being composed
</p>
<p>with a view to rake up the transactions of centuries past in the his-
</p>
<p>tory of Ireland, and to excite discontent among the Irish and hatred
</p>
<p>to the Saxon foreigners. I may state here for your information,
</p>
<p>that the account of each of those battles given by this paper, was
</p>
<p>adopted by this Association. The battle of Clontarf, which is first
</p>
<p>adverted to, was that in which Brian Boroihme with an Irish
</p>
<p>02
</p>
<p>army inferior in numbers, defeated the Danes; the second battle
</p>
<p>is that at the mouth of the Yellow Ford, where Hugh O'Neill ap-
</p>
<p>pears to have commanded the Irish ; the next is the battle of Ben-
</p>
<p>burb, in which the Irish were commanded by Owen Roe O'Neill ;
</p>
<p>then Limerick where general Sarsfield commanded. The card then
</p>
<p>upon a pillar upon one side states the comparative extent and popu-
</p>
<p>lation of Ireland compared with Portugal, Spain, Holland, Belgium,
</p>
<p>Naples, Bavaria, and other countries, and says : " Ireland has not
</p>
<p>a Parliament" It states the yearly revenue of this country, its ex-
</p>
<p>ports, that two-thirds of the men and officers of the English army are
</p>
<p>Irishmen, and again states that " Ireland has not a Parliament."
</p>
<p>There are two flags on the card, one containing the same motto
</p>
<p>as appears on the associates' card, the other is described to be the
</p>
<p>sun bursting from under a cloud, which I believe was the ancient
</p>
<p>banner of Ireland  there is then a small map of Ireland, and also a
</p>
<p>scroll at the top of the card and another at the bottom. On the scroll
</p>
<p>at the top there are these words : " Resolved unanimously, that the
</p>
<p>" claim of any body of men, other than the King, Lords, and Com-
</p>
<p>" mons of Ireland, to make laws to bind this kingdom, is unconstitu-
</p>
<p>" tional, illegal, and a grievance  Dungannon Volunteers, 1 5 Feb-
</p>
<p>ruary, 1782." There is a distinct statement on the face of this
</p>
<p>bond of union between the members of this society, that the claim of
</p>
<p>any body of men, other than the King, Lords, and Commons of Ire-
</p>
<p>land, to make laws to bind this kingdom is unconstitutional, illegal,
</p>
<p>and a grievance ; and I suppose it will be contended on the other
</p>
<p>side, that is what they can rightfully and legally make a portion of
</p>
<p>the contract by which they are to be united. You will be told that
</p>
<p>this resolution was adopted by the delegates from the Irish Volun-
</p>
<p>teers on the 15th of February, 1782. Gentlemen, I shall beg leave
</p>
<p>by way of anticipation to recall your recollection to what was the
</p>
<p>question in the year 1782 as contrasted with the present question.
</p>
<p>By the Statute of the 26th Geo. I., a Statute made by the English
</p>
<p>Parliament, having then no Irish representatives, but this country
</p>
<p>having then its own domestic legislature, a claim was made to bind

</p>
<p>Ireland by the force of the English Statute, and it was that which led
</p>
<p>to the resolution in 1782 made by the Irish Volunteers. At the
</p>
<p>time of this resolution of the Volunteers, keep in your recollec-
</p>
<p>tion the state in which the constitution of both countries stood ; Ire-
</p>
<p>land had a separate Parliament, the Parliament of Great Britain
</p>
<p>had no Irish representatives, and the Volunteers then denied the
</p>
<p>power of the English Parliament to bind Ireland by its laws. Sub-
</p>
<p>sequently, the Act of Union passed by the consent of the legislatures
</p>
<p>of both countries, and with the assent of the Crown, articles were
</p>
<p>drawn up and agreed to, which I shall hereafter advert to more par-
</p>
<p>ticularly, and by those articles which were adopted, it was provided,
</p>
<p>that both countries should be represented for ever by one united
</p>
<p>Parliament; and will it now be said, that because in 1782 the Irish
</p>
<p>Volunteers denied the right of the English Parliament, this country
</p>
<p>being then unrepresented in England, to make laws binding Ireland,
</p>
<p>G3
</p>
<p>when it had a legislature of its own, that that is to justify that bond
</p>
<p>of union which has been engraved on this card, declaring that the
</p>
<p>legislature of the United Kingdom has no authority to make laws to
</p>
<p>bind this country? A more illegal proposition, I will venture to say,
</p>
<p>never emanated from any persons the deepest in sedition. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, at the bottom of this card is written : " You may make the
</p>
<p>" Union a law, but you cannot make it binding upon conscience. 
</p>
<p>" Saurin's Speech." I dare say, in the course of this case you will
</p>
<p>have not only that speech of Mr. Saurin's adverted to, but also the
</p>
<p>speeches of Lord Plunket and the late Lord Chief Justice _of this
</p>
<p>Court ; but the persons who are constantly bringing those speeches
</p>
<p>before their deluded followers, always omit to state that these opi-
</p>
<p>nions were delivered in the Irish House of Commons before the
</p>
<p>passing of the Act of Union, and that they never fell from the lips of
</p>
<p>these eminent men, after the Union had become the law of the land.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, there is another class of persons in this Association, a
</p>
<p>higher class than members, these are persons who have subscribed or
</p>
<p>collected a sum of ten pounds, and they thereby become Volunteers.
</p>
<p>I hold in my hand one of the cards of the Volunteers : it is headed,
</p>
<p>" The Volunteers of' 1 782 revived," and is signed " T. M. Ray,
</p>
<p>Secretary" in the handwriting of one of the traversers. There is at
</p>
<p>the head of the card a likeness of Mr. O'Connell, and also of Grat-
</p>
<p>tan, Flood, Owen Roe O'Neill, and Brien Boroihme engraved
</p>
<p>upon it.
</p>
<p>These being the persons connected with the Association, it
</p>
<p>it was found necessary that there should be officers for the purpose
</p>
<p>of organizing the people, and accordingly we find that there were In-
</p>
<p>spectors, Baronial Inspectors, Repeal Wardens, and Collectors. The
</p>
<p>repeal wardens were, by the rules of the Association, to be appointed
</p>
<p>at the recommendation of the clergyman of the parish. They were
</p>
<p>only to be appointed, however they might be recommended, by the
</p>
<p>Association itself, and there was issued to each of them instructions
</p>
<p>as to their duties. This book is indorsed : " Instructions for the ap-
</p>
<p>pointment of repeal wardens, and collectors of the repeal fund, and

</p>
<p>their duties." The ninth duty of the repeal wardens is here stated
</p>
<p>to be, to take care that there is a repeal newspaper transmitted to
</p>
<p>their locality ; a three-day paper to such as had collected twenty
</p>
<p>pounds repeal rent, and a weekly paper to such as had collected ten
</p>
<p>pounds. The tenth duty of the repeal wardens was to see that those
</p>
<p>newspapers were put into the hands of such persons as would give
</p>
<p>them the greatest circulation, and to see that each paper was read,
</p>
<p>and its contents communicated to as many persons as possible ; to
</p>
<p>circulate all news respecting the Repeal Association, and the transac-
</p>
<p>tions of such of the general business as appertained to the question;
</p>
<p>and that, when such a number of repealers as were then pointed out
</p>
<p>should be embodied, a room was to be hired for their general organi-
</p>
<p>zation, and that the wardens, in such a case, were to consult the
</p>
<p>Association at all times respecting their movements. You will thus
</p>
<p>observe, Gentlemen, that in every district, according to the course of
</p>
<p>64
</p>
<p>instruction which the repeal wardens received, their duty was, that if
</p>
<p>the sum often pounds came from the district, they should be sup-
</p>
<p>plied with a weekly paper, and if twenty pounds, with a three-day
</p>
<p>paper, with a view, that the sedition which the repeal press traded
</p>
<p>in should be circulated among as many persons as possible.
</p>
<p>Such was part of the duty of the officers of the Association, to en-
</p>
<p>deavour, by the publication of seditious articles and harangues,
</p>
<p>to have the country organized, and to excite hatred and discontent
</p>
<p>among various classes, and opposition to the law ; and part of the
</p>
<p>system was to take care that the repeal press should be instrumental
</p>
<p>in carrying out this design. I may observe, that there was nothing
</p>
<p>new in making the press an object for attaining a revolution in a
</p>
<p>country. It was by means of the French press, and particularly that
</p>
<p>celebrated organ, " JJ Ami du JPeuple," that the minds of the
</p>
<p>people in France were poisoned. The same course was adopted in
</p>
<p>the year 1798, by the newspaper of the day, known by the name
</p>
<p>of " The Press," but I trust that this conspiracy has been checked
</p>
<p>in sufficient time to prevent now the consequences which followed on
</p>
<p>a former occasion, from the licentiousness of the press. I shall
</p>
<p>now explain, not in my own language, but in the language of
</p>
<p>one of the traversers, the manner in which this organization was
</p>
<p>carried out through the country. I shall have occasion in the
</p>
<p>course of my statement to call the attention of the jury in a more
</p>
<p>particular manner to this important publication, but I shall now
</p>
<p>only read a short extract from it, showing the objects of the
</p>
<p>Association in organizing the country, by means of the appointment
</p>
<p>of repeal wardens. One of the defendants, Mr. Charles Gavan
</p>
<p>Duffy, in the Nation newspaper of the 12th of August last says : " if
</p>
<p>' the organization by general, provincial, and baronial inspectors, by
</p>
<p>" wardens and collectors, by volunteers, members and associates, has
</p>
<p>" any efficiency, and it now has a fair trial, a far different machinery,
</p>
<p>" though checked and hampered, carried Catholic Emancipation ;
</p>
<p>" the present organization will be extended to every parish in
</p>
<p>" Ireland, and will be perfect in every parish. The whole nation

</p>
<p>" will be arranged under that system. There is a full purpose on the
</p>
<p>" minds of the repeal leaders not to rest until it is carried out. By
</p>
<p>" its means the people will be gradually arrayed, classed, organized,
</p>
<p>" and bound together. Subordination of ranks, community of thought,
</p>
<p>" obedience to orders, firm trust in those who command them, con-
</p>
<p>" stant activity in teaching and learning the means of liberation, are
</p>
<p>" rapidly becoming general. In a subsequent part of the same pub-
</p>
<p>lication he says, " the organization should not only be carried on
</p>
<p>" every where, but should be revised every where. If the repeal
</p>
<p>" wardens of any district do not see the organization, revision, and
</p>
<p>" training of all repealers in their district ; if the people do not
</p>
<p>** evince organization by obedience, a sense of their duty, courage,
</p>
<p>44 and habitual order which take place in a free nation, those war-
</p>
<p>" dens have not done their duty, that district is not ready for liberty."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you have heard of the Jacobin club in France. No
</p>
<p>65
</p>
<p>person contemplated the consequences which would succeed the for-
</p>
<p>mation of that club, but it at length succeeded in overthrowing
</p>
<p>one government, and that which succeeded it could not be found
</p>
<p>to exist on the principles which gave it birth, but was followed
</p>
<p>by a despotism which continued, as you know, for a series of
</p>
<p>years. Gentlemen, you will recollect the instructions that were
</p>
<p>given by Mr. Duffy, to the repeal wardens, that if they had not
</p>
<p>adopted the course which had been suggested, they had not done
</p>
<p>their duty, and that district was not ready for liberty. I cannot
</p>
<p>abstain in this place from describing the mischief arising from an
</p>
<p>organization and a conspiracy of this description, by reading the
</p>
<p>language of the late Chief Justice of this court, when presiding as
</p>
<p>judge at the Maryborough Special Commission. He says, page 8 of
</p>
<p>Mr. Mongan's report of the Special Commission held there, " In the
</p>
<p>" case of individuals, the progress from one offence to another is
</p>
<p>" mostly gradual, but in the case of associated criminals, rapid. It
</p>
<p>" is the nature of unlawful associations to inflame the passions of one
</p>
<p>" man by the passions of another, and to bring into general action
</p>
<p>" the collected views of many. The man whose own temptation or
</p>
<p>" frailty would be insufficient to urge him onward in the career of
</p>
<p>" guilt, whose own reason or compunction might arrest, his progress,
</p>
<p>" is borne along with the torrent, bad example decides him, false
</p>
<p>" shame hardens him, and he is precipitated almost necessarily into
</p>
<p>" crime." That was the description of conspiracies and of the re-
</p>
<p>sult of societies of this kind, by that eminent and gifted individual.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I shall now call your attention to the earliest meeting
</p>
<p>of the Repeal Association, to which I think it necessary to advert.
</p>
<p>Though from the great weight and magnitude of this case, it will be
</p>
<p>impossible to call your attention to every meeting, I shall however
</p>
<p>direct it to every important meeting, and although I shall necessarily
</p>
<p>occupy a large portion of your time, I shall select only those which
</p>
<p>I consider important. Gentlemen, of that Association each of the
</p>
<p>traversers is a member. I shall show that they were in the habit
</p>
<p>of attending its meetings, although I have not access to the books.

</p>
<p>It is immaterial whether they paid the subscription or not, if they
</p>
<p>took part in the proceedings. The first meeting to which I shall call
</p>
<p>your attention was held on the 13th February, 1843 ; there were pre-
</p>
<p>sent upon that occasion, Mr. O'Connell (I mean Mr. Daniel O'Connell,
</p>
<p>whenever I speak of the other Mr. O'Connell, 1 shall call him Mr.
</p>
<p>John O'Connell), Mr. Duffy, and Mr. Ray. At that meeting Mr.
</p>
<p>Ray read an abstract of the accounts for the last year, among which
</p>
<p>was the cost of newspapers, amounting to 365 15s. l\d., that being
</p>
<p>part of the expenditure of the Association, for the purpose of circu-
</p>
<p>lating those papers through the country, which were calculated to
</p>
<p>excite feelings of hostility against the government and constitution
</p>
<p>of the country. At that meeting it was that a diploma was pro-
</p>
<p>duced, which I should have remarked on when speaking of the
</p>
<p>repeal wardens. It is a handsome engraved document, and although
</p>
<p>I call it a diploma at present, you will find that possibly it had re-
</p>
<p>K
</p>
<p>66
</p>
<p>ference to other duties, besides those which I have mentioned, of
</p>
<p>the repeal wardens. You will find that one of the traversers on one
</p>
<p>occasion asked whether the people would not follow the repeal
</p>
<p>wardens, as well as if they were called sergeants. That was the
</p>
<p>diploma, or I should say, the commission, which was issued on that
</p>
<p>occasion. At that meeting Mr. O'Connell made these observations.
</p>
<p>" It must be clear to those powers, that all the power of England
</p>
<p>" is more imaginary than real, is not this then the time for Ireland ?
</p>
<p>" The great mistake of Napoleon was that he undervalued Ireland.
</p>
<p>" If, instead of taking an army to Egypt or to Russia, he had sent
</p>
<p>" 40,000 men to Ireland, what would be the consequence ? He
</p>
<p>" would have had all the educated classes opposed to and ready to
</p>
<p>" meet him in arms, and repel invasion, but would he have the
</p>
<p>M population opposing him ? Would not the question be raised
</p>
<p>" amongst them whether they would not be better under French
</p>
<p>" than under English dominion ? What would be the answer to that
</p>
<p>" question ? It would be given in the voice of millions, and would
</p>
<p>" sever the connexion in less time than he had been addressing
</p>
<p>" them. France knew of the discontent of the people, she knew
</p>
<p>M that by the educated classes she would be opposed, but she also
</p>
<p>" knew, now that Christianity again blessed her altars, that the
</p>
<p>" anointed priests of God were heard as formerly from her pulpits,
</p>
<p>" and that the spirit of religion had taken the place of the spirit of
</p>
<p>" atheism and infidelity, which made the Irish abhor them, and when
</p>
<p>" the soldier would go to mass side by side with the peasant, that
</p>
<p>" the statesman was mad who would leave Ireland in her present
</p>
<p>" position, except he resolved not to go to war with France or any
</p>
<p>" other country. But let them rally with him and get repeal from
</p>
<p>" England, she might defy all the countries upon the face of the
</p>
<p>" earth. There was no country upon the face of the earth so strong
</p>
<p>" in her natural resources as Ireland. There was a natural strength
</p>
<p>" of a military nature in Ireland, such as no other country possessed.
</p>
<p>" Her enclosures make every field a redoubt, where cavalry could
</p>
<p>" never bear down upon her infantry. The light and hardy soldier

</p>
<p>" would find a protection in every field in the country. The roads
</p>
<p>" were a kind of defiles, and if the congregated powers of Russia en-
</p>
<p>" deavoured to pour out its force upon Ireland, and if Irishmen were
</p>
<p>" led by their own countrymen, they would fling the invaders from
</p>
<p>" their cliffs into the sea, and thus disenthral the land from her op-
</p>
<p>" pressors." Now, gentlemen of the jury, I would ask, is Russia
</p>
<p>the oppressor of Ireland? Is it not clear that he spoke of the con-
</p>
<p>gregated force of England ; and that if Ireland was led by her own
</p>
<p>leaders, it was the forces of the latter she would drive out ; for you
</p>
<p>will find it occurring elsewhere in his speech, that England is desig-
</p>
<p>nated as the oppressor of Ireland ? Is not this intended to be convey-
</p>
<p>ed and circulated amongst the people by the newspapers (the repeal
</p>
<p>wardens taking care that they shall be read), to excite the misguided
</p>
<p>population of this country against the people of England ? You
</p>
<p>have Ireland as a military position pointed out ; every field a re-
</p>
<p>doubt, every road a defile, a place where cavalry could not act
</p>
<p>67
</p>
<p>against the infantry, and as the card has pointed out, they were de-
</p>
<p>feated in four actions, and why should not the Irish, being led by their
</p>
<p>own people in the next action, defeat the oppressors of their
</p>
<p>country ?
</p>
<p>J will now refer to a publication of Mr. Barrett, the editor
</p>
<p>of the Pilot newspaper, one of the traversers who has been taking
</p>
<p>a prominent part in this conspiracy, and endeavouring, as far as
</p>
<p>he could, to excite discontent and disaffection among the people.
</p>
<p>This was one of the papers which was to be circulated through
</p>
<p>the country by the repeal wardens, they taking care, according to
</p>
<p>their instructions, that it should be read by as many of the deluded
</p>
<p>populace as possible. The paper I refer to bears date the 10th
</p>
<p>March, 1843. It gives an account of a repeal meeting held in
</p>
<p>Washington, in America. I shall not trouble the Court with all that
</p>
<p>occurred at that meeting, but I shall merely refer to a speech de-
</p>
<p>livered by Mr. Tyler, son of the American President, in which he
</p>
<p>says, speaking of the Irish people : " when we see that people amount
</p>
<p>" to nine millions, and when we know they are brave in the field,
</p>
<p>" eloquent in the senate, wise in the cabinet, united and determined
</p>
<p>" to be free, we cannot suppose for a moment their freedom is im-
</p>
<p>" possible, or even difficult. The libation to freedom must some-
</p>
<p>" times be quaffed in blood. The Irish heart he looked upon as
</p>
<p>" true as freedom's pole, true as is the magnet to the north, and their
</p>
<p>" lives are given cheaply in the purchase of liberty." I shall now call
</p>
<p>your attention to the leading article in that paper, where that speech
</p>
<p>and the sentiments expressed in it are adverted to. It is there
</p>
<p>spoken of, as " a bold, statesmanlike speech," so that the libation to
</p>
<p>freedom must be sometimes quaffed in blood, and the lives of the
</p>
<p>Irish are given cheaply in the purchase of liberty ; that is what Mr.
</p>
<p>Barrett calls a bold, statesmanlike speech. Mr. Barrett then goes on
</p>
<p>further to state : " we learn from our private correspondent that
</p>
<p>" Robert Tyler, the gentleman we allude to, is a young man of great
</p>
<p>" talent, the secretary of his father, and of course the representative
</p>
<p>u and expounder of that father's sentiments. Very well. Now here

<p>" is the President of the United States a repealer of the unholy

</p>
<p>" have awakened her to the necessity of checking that rapacity. She
</p>
<p>" is bound to this course by self-interest ; England aspires to univer-
</p>
<p>" sal sway. This is incompatible with the safety and liberty of the
</p>
<p>" United States. The efforts of England to take possession of far
</p>
<p>" more than her share] of the Oregon territory on the south Pa-
</p>
<p> cific shore of America, has already called forth the anxieties of
</p>
<p>" American statesmen. America naturally calculates that Ireland
</p>
<p>68
</p>
<p>" can be attached to her interests. Ireland is, after all, an important
</p>
<p>" section of the national family. Napoleon once said, that had he
</p>
<p>" landed his Egyptian army in Ireland, and turned it into a republic,
</p>
<p>" he might have changed the destinies of Europe. Mr. Benton, the
</p>
<p>" Missouri senator, uttered a similar sentiment in the senate house
</p>
<p>" the other day  a curious coincidence." This is the publication the
</p>
<p>members of the Repeal Association consider themselves justified in
</p>
<p>circulating through the entire of this country. This is the poison
</p>
<p>infused into the minds of the Irish people, who would be obedient to
</p>
<p>the laws if left alone, were it not for those mischievous agitators
</p>
<p>leading them on for their own ends. These were the means, to use
</p>
<p>the language of a late minister of the Crown, by which a revolution
</p>
<p>is sought to be effected ; a republic is sought to be established ; a
</p>
<p>republic of which Mr. O'Connell is to be the leader and chief. This
</p>
<p>is the purpose, this is the curious coincidence, to which Mr. Barrett
</p>
<p>alludes.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the next step taken in this conspiracy was to accus-
</p>
<p>tom large bodies of men to assemble together from great distances,
</p>
<p>who were to march great distances pursuant to orders issued to
</p>
<p>them, thus to accustom them to meet and come from those distant
</p>
<p>places, to assemble together, not with arms in their hands, because
</p>
<p>they were first to be drilled and to assemble without arms, until the
</p>
<p>proper period had arrived for putting arms into their hards. They
</p>
<p>were to go to these meetings in military organization, not to act, but,
</p>
<p>as Lord Tenterden and Lord Wynford pointed out, in Bedford v.
</p>
<p>Birli/, when the time had arrived, when the drilling was complete,
</p>
<p>when the time of England's infirmity which was Ireland's opportunity
</p>
<p>had arrived, then the order for taking up arms was to be given.
</p>
<p>There was nothing new in this. Every step of this conspiracy has
</p>
<p>its precedent. The same course was adopted in 1797, previous to
</p>
<p>the rebellion. It is a matter of history. By the report of a com-
</p>
<p>mittee of secrecy appointed by the House of Commons, for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of inquiring into matters connected with the breaking out of the
</p>
<p>rebellion of 1798, it is said in page 6 of the report : " We your com-

</p>
<p>" mittee beg leave to call the attention of the House to the procla-
</p>
<p>" mation of the Lord Lieutenant and Council, beating date the 6th
</p>
<p>" day of November, 1796, issued in consequence of the disaffected
</p>
<p>" having adopted a practice of marching in military array and assem-
</p>
<p>" bling in large bodies, in some instances to the number of several
</p>
<p>" thousands, under the pretence of saving corn and digging potatoes,
</p>
<p>11 but in fact to terrify the peaceable and well disposed, and to com-
</p>
<p>" pel them to enter into their treasonable association." Such was
</p>
<p>the plan of organization prior to the rebellion of 1798  and that is the
</p>
<p>precedent from which these monster meetings were taken. The first
</p>
<p>meetings in 1843 are of little importance  they became more so as
</p>
<p>the conspiracy increased in strength and daring. A meeting took
</p>
<p>place in the county of Meath, it was the first of the monster meet-
</p>
<p>ings, and was held at Trim on the 19th of March, 1843, and three
</p>
<p>of the traversers were present at it, Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Steele,
</p>
<p>and Mr. Barrett. There were about thirty thousand persons assem-
</p>
<p>69
</p>
<p>bled there, and a dinner was given the same day at which the leaders
</p>
<p>of this assembled multitude were present. At this dinner the toast
</p>
<p>of the people having been given, Mr. Barrett returned thanks. " He
</p>
<p>" adverted to the progress of repeal, said that they were certain to
</p>
<p>" succeed, situated as England was abroad and at home, and he called
</p>
<p>" on them to be united, tranquil, and generally organized, and when
</p>
<p>" the time was come, Ireland had but to stamp ber foot and she
</p>
<p>" would be free." This is the legal, constitutional, and peaceable
</p>
<p>mode by which this great alteration in the constitution of the realm
</p>
<p>is to be obtained, and it is quite consistent with what Mr. Duffy
</p>
<p>stated. " If the repeal wardens have not done their duty, that parish
</p>
<p>is not ready for liberty." But when every parish is ready for liberty,
</p>
<p>when it is ready for rebellion, then Ireland had but to stamp her foot
</p>
<p>and she would gain repeal. At that same dinner Mr. O'Connell said,
</p>
<p>" When I think of the multitudes by which I have been surrounded
</p>
<p>" to day, and the bright eyes that looked on me, the elasticity of spi-
</p>
<p>" rit that was there ; when I beheld on one side those smiles and fe-
</p>
<p>" male loveliness, and on the other those reverend clergymen bring-
</p>
<p>" ing benedictions, I will ask the men of Meath will you be slaves?
</p>
<p>" I would rather be in my grave or a freeman !!" Do you recollect
</p>
<p>the observations of Lord Tenterden in reference to the inscriptions
</p>
<p>on banners as affecting the illegality of the assembly. " Better die
</p>
<p>like freemen than be sold as slaves." He further says: "When I
</p>
<p>" ask are you slaves, I would rather be in my grave or a freeman. I
</p>
<p>" had occasion latterly to be rummaging in Irish history, and I found
</p>
<p>" some nice morsels in her bygone story. I found that many occa-
</p>
<p>" sions occurred in which the Irish jwere on the point of victory
</p>
<p>" when they abandoned the field. In the most disastrous battles
</p>
<p>" that they fought, victory was their's if they persevered ; even at
</p>
<p>" Aughrim they had a triumph if they only had perseverance to in-
</p>
<p>" sure it, and even at the blood-stained Boyne they would have gained
</p>
<p>" the victory if thev had fought for another half hour. Irish history
</p>
<p>" is full of such instances, but on every occasion the same confiding
</p>
<p>" in their enemies, the same believing in the moderation of their

</p>
<p>" foes, the same conceiving that the English were not actually as bad
</p>
<p>" as was represented, and that they might safely acquiesce in their
</p>
<p>" dominion, was always the cause of the overthrow of Ireland. There
</p>
<p>" is not a human being so stultified as to think that the English par-
</p>
<p>" liament will do anything for Ireland ; I would walk from this to
</p>
<p>" Drogheda and back again to see the man who is blockhead enough
</p>
<p>" to expect anything else except injustice from an English parlia-
</p>
<p>" ment." Thus upon that occasion Mr. O'Connell adverted to the
</p>
<p>physical force which surrounded him ; he recalled to their recollec-
</p>
<p>tion the battles of the Boyne and of Aughrim ; he called on them to
</p>
<p>say, whether they would be slaves ; that they had nothing to hope
</p>
<p>from an English parliament, and if they would follow his example
</p>
<p>they should either go to their graves or be free men. It may not be
</p>
<p>improper to state here a matter by no means unimportant, that dur-
</p>
<p>ing the whole of the last session of parliament no petition was pre-
</p>
<p>sented from one of those multitudinous meetings. It is not surprising
</p>
<p>70
</p>
<p>that there was not, it would he rather singular if a petition was pre-
</p>
<p>sented, the leaders at those meetings having stated they had nothing
</p>
<p>to hope from that parliament, which alone by legal means could as-
</p>
<p>sent to the carrying of the object they profess. I know you will be
</p>
<p>told that shortly before this prosecution was instituted, there had been
</p>
<p>considerable activity in purchasing parchment, to prevent the conse-
</p>
<p>quence arising from the possibility of its being truly alleged that no
</p>
<p>petition had been presented ; but even if they had presented a peti-
</p>
<p>tion, what passed would have shown merely that it was a colourable
</p>
<p>proceeding, that their object was not to be carried by constitutional
</p>
<p>means, or through the instrumentality of the legislature.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, something more than a year ago a newspaper called the
</p>
<p>Nation, was established in Dublin, of which one of the traversers, Mr.
</p>
<p>Duffy, is the proprietor. You will recollect what I have already advert-
</p>
<p>ed to, that it was a principle of the Repeal Association, to circulate these
</p>
<p>papers as much as possible amongst the people. Now I believe it is
</p>
<p>a saying which has been so frequently repeated as to become a pro-
</p>
<p>verb : " I shall leave to you the making of the laws, if you give to me
</p>
<p>the writing of the ballads." It is a singular circumstance that the
</p>
<p>writing of seditious poetry had been resorted to previous to the late
</p>
<p>Irish Rebellion. In the report of the Secret Committee you will find
</p>
<p>extracts from newspapers of the same class of seditious poetry which
</p>
<p>was circulated to poison the minds of the people of this country.
</p>
<p>The " Nation " has become the means of sending abroad pieces of
</p>
<p>seditious poetry, which have become so numerous, that I find they
</p>
<p>have published them in a volume called " The Spirit of the Nation."
</p>
<p>I shall not trouble you with reading it, but one specimen will give
</p>
<p>you to understand the extent to which it has been made use of.
</p>
<p>This poem appeared in the Nation of the first of April last, it is enti-
</p>
<p>tled : " The memory of the Dead." It is as follows :
</p>
<p>THE MEMORY OF THE DEAD.

<p>" We drink the memory of the brave,

</p>
<p>And true men, be you, men,
</p>
<p>Like those of Ninety-Eight."
</p>
<p>That is the publication by which it was intended to poison the
</p>
<p>minds of the people of this country. What I have read to you is
</p>
<p>but a single specimen of an entire volume, which is full of exciting,
</p>
<p>inflammatory, and seditious publications, for the purpose of creating
</p>
<p>discontent and disaffection among the people of this country. I have
</p>
<p>looked through a volume of a newspaper, which was published in the
</p>
<p>year 1797, called the Press, and which was established with the ob-
</p>
<p>ject of advocating the rebellion, and I find nothing in it like the
</p>
<p>poem which I have read. Gentlemen, I shall now read to you an
</p>
<p>article from the same paper, the Nation, of the 29th of April, 1843,
</p>
<p>It commences thus : " Something is coming ; aye, let it be for good
</p>
<p>" or evil, something is coming. Some crisis, some decided swell or
</p>
<p>" ebb of Ireland's fortune is not far off. The country at length is
</p>
<p>" roused, gathering and darkening, and accumulating, have its forces
</p>
<p>" been for long, and men said, 'It will be a shower,' and ''twill pass
</p>
<p>" away ;' but now the masses are suddenly rolling together and crowd-
</p>
<p>72
</p>
<p>" ing the firmament. The heart of Ireland begins to beat strongly.
</p>
<p>" This is a solemn time for all men who can influence the people.
</p>
<p>" Excitement fully as great existed here before, and existed vainly, or
</p>
<p>" worse. Of the great agitations which have taken place within the
</p>
<p>" life-time of our old men, how many have failed, how few succeeded.
</p>
<p>" From 1779 to 1783, a series of triumphs were gained. But how were
</p>
<p>" they won ? England was exhausted and discouraged by the loss of
</p>
<p>" her finest armies in America  a French fleet hovered on her coasts
</p>
<p>"  she could not refuse  she had not military strength to resist the
</p>
<p>" demand of the Volunteers for arms  for arms and for liberty. Had
</p>
<p>" she refused, a Rochambeau or a Lafayette would have been wel-
</p>
<p>" corned on the coasts, and a half campaign would have seen an inde-
</p>
<p>" pendent Irish flag flying over the Castle. England yielded. Again,
</p>
<p>" in 1793, the victories of the French republic, the threatened revolts
</p>
<p>" in both England and Scotland, and the Ulster alliance with France,
</p>
<p>" gained toleration. And lastly, in 1829, the organization and resolve of
</p>
<p>" our peasantry, the din of American armament (for the field pieces
</p>
<p>" of an Irish artillery rumbled through Philadelphia), the muttered
</p>
<p>" resolve of the Irish soldiery not to coerce their country, and the
</p>
<p>" menace of France that she would not leave Ireland single-handed
</p>
<p>" in the fray, carried Catholic emancipation. Let no man mistake
</p>
<p>" us. We do not wish to discourage the people, but to put them in
</p>
<p>" a state of mind as remote from depression as from frivolous confi-
</p>
<p>" dence  confidence has no safe basis except in thorough knowledge.
</p>
<p>" We do not bid the people crouch in cowardly woe  we summon
</p>
<p>" them forth to strain every nerve, to abandon present comfort, to
</p>
<p>" make any sacrifice for liberty, provided they see clearly for what
</p>
<p>" they came forth, and how they are to succeed. But we never will
</p>
<p>" urge them out with us on the troubled waters unless we are sure of
</p>
<p>" ship and crew, and foresee how we shall weather the gale. We re-
</p>
<p>" peat, then, that there are signs of storm abroad, and we wish the
</p>
<p>" people to look into the tempest, and measure its strength, and pre-
</p>
<p>" pare to conquer it. Ireland has the means of a present and par-
</p>
<p>" tial, and of an ultimate and complete success in her own hands, if

</p>
<p>" she go wisely, and therefore sternly, coolly, and vigorously to work.
</p>
<p>" Let no man believe that they have undertaken a holiday mumming
</p>
<p>" in meeting England's remorseless and subtle despotism. Let us
</p>
<p>" have no bragging or fool-hardiness. There has been too much of
</p>
<p>" this at all times in Ireland. If we are all that we are apt to call
</p>
<p>" ourselves, how comes it that millions of our population often
</p>
<p>" want a second meal ? And why have we failed to loosen or smash
</p>
<p>" England's cruel and wasting gripe of us? No! no! the Irish have
</p>
<p>" great genius and courage, but they require to educate and steady
</p>
<p>" themselves into that foresight and perseverance which win cam-
</p>
<p>" paigns as well as battles, in politics or war. Let us look about us
</p>
<p>" for the elements of success  let us throw away no resources, offend
</p>
<p>" no ally, arouse no neutral, and abandon no strong position. We
</p>
<p>" have the opportunity and the means themselves to our hands.
</p>
<p>" America is more unanimous in its friendship, and more power-
</p>
<p>" fill in its means, than in 1829. Let America be told the whole
</p>
<p>73
</p>
<p>" truth of our position, and she will do her best. We can pro-
</p>
<p>" mise for some of the ablest and greatest in France. The
</p>
<p>" French people long to serve us. England is in distress. Her
</p>
<p>" finances are in difficulty. Her colonial empire  India, the Cape,
</p>
<p>" China, Canada, &c, make such a demand on her, that out of
</p>
<p>" one hundred and three battalions, which constitute her infantry
</p>
<p>" of the line, eighty are abroad, and only twenty-three in the
</p>
<p>" three kingdoms. And unless the late blows received from Portugal
</p>
<p>" and Brazil tend to keep her up against the staggering shocks
</p>
<p>" from without, and the huge cancer of aristocracy within, her pecu-
</p>
<p>" niary resources will diminish as the demand for them increases.
</p>
<p>" What then is wanting? Exertion, coolness, patience, and courage.
</p>
<p>" The people of Ireland are more sober and orderly, though possi-
</p>
<p>" bly not more excited than in some of their former movements.
</p>
<p>" Let them endeavour to get more order and more intelligence  let
</p>
<p>" them do and prepare more than hitherto  let them be kind, conci-
</p>
<p>" liatory, and forgiving to such of the Protestants as have not yet
</p>
<p>"joined  and above all things let them avoid any outbreak or colli-
</p>
<p>" sion with the troops or police. The police to a man, and the ma-
</p>
<p>" jority of the troops of the line, are Irishmen. Why should the
</p>
<p>" people despair of their patriotism, or injure them in any way ?"
</p>
<p>Now I pray your attention to what follows : " premature insurrec-
</p>
<p>" tions, and needless provocation of party, and military hostility have
</p>
<p>" before ruined as good hopes as ours. .Rapid, uniform, and careful
</p>
<p>" organization for the repeal agitation, charity and conciliation, and a
</p>
<p>" strict observance of the laws, are the pressing and present duties of
</p>
<p>" every Irishman." They wished the people to wait until the organi-
</p>
<p>zation was complete  until every parish in Ireland was ready ; but
</p>
<p>they wanted them to wait in peace, for one of the mottoes of the
</p>
<p>Association was : "the man who commits a crime, gives strength to
</p>
<p>the enemy," meaning the Saxon foreigner, the person from whose
</p>
<p>relentless grasp, when the time arrives, you are to extricate yourselves,
</p>
<p>but your present duty is a strict observance of the law. The article then
</p>
<p>goes on to say : "Thus shall we battle our foes! We have been led

<p>" into this train of thought by Mr. O'ConneH's proposal to form an
</p>
<p>" association of three hundred men of trust, to consider and prepare
</p>
<p>" a bill for the repeal of the Union. We did not hesitate to differ
</p>
<p>" from that illustrious man upon smaller questions. If we disliked
</p>
<p>" his present design we should at once express our dissent, for can-
</p>
<p>" dour and fair dealing are the first of all duties in times like these.
</p>
<p>" We speak, then, not as flatterers, nor thoughtless assentors, when
</p>
<p>" we call this project the wisest, the boldest, and the most pregnant
</p>
<p>" with great results of any measure he ever proposed in Ireland ; if
</p>
<p>" the people do their duty, this machinery must triumph. But upon
</p>
<p>"the composition of that body, on the just and judicious zeal with
</p>
<p>" which it is matured, and on the firm courage with which it is backed
</p>
<p>" by the people, every thing depends. If the people, flattered at the
</p>
<p>" thought of a new plan, grow negligent in their organization, and
</p>
<p>" remiss in their agitation, or if they hastily promise, and blindly

<p>" knaves, or bigots, men of doubtful courage, vain or clumsy intel-

</p>
<p>" confided in, no matter what they may will or do, and if they are
</p>
<p>" not supported to the last shilling, and the last man, the attempt
</p>
<p>" will only come crushing back on us in shame and ruin. But if the
</p>
<p>" people go on meeting, organizing, collecting, and conciliating  if
</p>
<p>" they trust their contributions to bold, faithful, educated, and tole-
</p>
<p>" rant men, and if they stand by those they trust, without cavil or
</p>
<p>" flinching, Ireland will soon be a nation." One would suppose that
</p>
<p>such an article as this might have been conceived sufficient for one
</p>
<p>publication ; but such is not the case, for in the same number of
</p>
<p>the paper there is another article to which I was most desirous of
</p>
<p>drawing your attention. It is entitled " Our Nationality," and is
</p>
<p>to the following effect : " The olive growth of nationality is over-
</p>
<p>spreading the provinces, and taking permanent root in the heart of
</p>
<p>the land. Assured millions gather round it, watching its progress
</p>
<p>and its strength with straining eyes, and cold were his who sees its
</p>
<p>beauty unmoved, whose heart yearneth not for its saving shade. If
</p>
<p>such there were, they are fast disappearing ; those who were with-
</p>
<p>out hope are now firmest in national belief, and the shrinking and
</p>
<p>timid are become the forward and most bold. Many, too, who
</p>
<p>only a year ago, regarded it as a fair, unreal vision, now cling to it, as
</p>
<p>a palpable, intelligible, and immeasurable blessing already clutched
</p>
<p>in their hearts' grasp, and only to escape thence when those hearts
</p>
<p>are cold and pulseless. Men meet in the highways, between whom
</p>
<p>there had been long and frantic estrangement, and while they shake
</p>
<p>hands in common hope, they stare around them for that mutual
</p>
<p>juggle, by whose dexterous application was shuffled out of view the
</p>
<p>lasting glory, which each could share with each, and all enjoy abun-
</p>
<p>dantly. This is a mighty accomplishment  the great seed is sown,
</p>
<p>the people come together, they move on, they are in earnest,
</p>
<p>they are determined, the end is begun ; already Ireland is a
</p>
<p>nation. And this is but the work of a few ; the lesson of sanguine

</p>
<p>men, among whom we have had an humble place ; the teaching of
</p>
<p>truth confirmed and matured by wrong. Men's thoughts were
</p>
<p>probed ; they were told to garner their individual sufferings, to
</p>
<p>forget them in their country's dependence ; history was opened to
</p>
<p>them, and it showed them those on whose fiat their hopes were
</p>
<p>based, remorseless, truthless, cold, selfish, and bloody, in every age
</p>
<p>and every clime ; it showed them that to lean there, was to lean
</p>
<p>on death, and their own sense and courage did the rest. They
</p>
<p>have resolved to trust no more to treachery, and their resolve, as
</p>
<p>it ever must be in the case of a unanimous and daring nation, is
</p>
<p>already a wish fulfilled. And in their virtuous undertaking the
</p>
<p>Irish do not want for cheering inspirations. Good men, whether
</p>
<p>subdued or triumphant, from the Danube to the Seine, and from
</p>
<p>the Seine to the Ohio, look approvingly on their actions, and
</p>
<p>take their cause to heart. Among the whole civilized race they
</p>
<p><0
</p>
<p>" have no foes but the Saxon ; no opponent but the clumsy and de-
</p>
<p>" crepid thing that calls itself our master. With so little to deter
</p>
<p>" us ; with heaven above us and the earth below us, where our
</p>
<p>" martyred fathers lie ; with our conscience as our guide, and the
</p>
<p>" world to cheer us, is it not marvellous that we could have so long
</p>
<p>" stooped to a beggarly servility ? But this is unavailing. Let us
</p>
<p>" look back only to be assured. If the past supply no higher iin-
</p>
<p>" pulses than the present, let it be forgotten. It has lessons which,
</p>
<p>" when we are called on to forgive, will afford ample scope for the
</p>
<p>" exercise of the most difficult of the Christian virtues, and till
</p>
<p>" then it shall rest with those unavenged heroes who have become a
</p>
<p>" portion of itself. At present other thoughts must animate, other
</p>
<p>" impulses must be obeyed. There is yet work to be done,
</p>
<p>" danger to be dared, and difficulty to be removed. These are
</p>
<p>" to be met and triumphed over. Every successive step, as
</p>
<p>" it becomes more momentous, becomes more perilous, and re-
</p>
<p>" quires corresponding caution, courage, and virtue. Our enemy
</p>
<p>" may be aroused, and so must Ireland. The county of Tipperary
</p>
<p>" is on its peaceful parade ; there prevailed among the people there
</p>
<p>" a sense of indifference, a disinclination to work until the great
</p>
<p>" task was set before them. Besides this, they wished to work to-
</p>
<p>" gether, and for so high an enterprise they felt that until now the
</p>
<p>" time was not come. Their present earnestness demonstrates that
</p>
<p>" they but waited for the auspicious hour to strike a decisive blow,
</p>
<p>" and take a becoming stand for the fortunes of their country.
</p>
<p>" Their purpose is a noble one, and if we interpret them aright their
</p>
<p>" plans must be successful. There are to be two meetings, one in
</p>
<p>" each riding. Neither is meant for show. The multitude will not
</p>
<p>" come to gaze and shout, and return to a listless indifference of
</p>
<p>" their country's fate ; they will come pledged to purchase its re-
</p>
<p>" demption at whatever cost. The demonstration will be one of
</p>
<p>" works. Each parish will be prepared to show," not what it thinks,
</p>
<p>" but what it has done. They will appoint representative delegates
</p>
<p>" from every locality, who will tender to the Liberator the allegiance

<p>" of those who are willing to pay for the honour of serving their
</p>
<p>" country. The two meetings will come off on the 23rd and 25th
</p>
<p>" of May, and if we be not misinformed, these days will form a
</p>
<p>" meaning era in the struggle for native liberty. Twenty thousand
</p>
<p>" Tipperary men, who would as soon, if called on, pay their blood
</p>
<p>" as their subscriptions, would not form a bad National Guard for
</p>
<p>" Ireland. - '
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, at this stage of the proceedings it may be right,
</p>
<p>having already stated the opinions of the late government with res-
</p>
<p>pect to the question of a repeal of the Union, to recall to your
</p>
<p>recollection what took place between the former and the next multi-
</p>
<p>tudinous meeting to which I shall have to call your attention. On
</p>
<p>the 9th of May, 1843, in the House of Commons, the excitement
</p>
<p>which prevailed in Ireland in consequence of those multitudinous
</p>
<p>meetings, gave rise to a question, which was put to the first minister
</p>
<p>of the Crown, and upon that occasion he made the following observa-
</p>
<p>76
</p>
<p>tions: " I can state, that her Majesty's government are alive to the
</p>
<p>" evils which arise from the existing agitation in Ireland, with respect
</p>
<p>" to the repeal of the Union. And I further state, that there is no
</p>
<p>" power, no authority which the prerogative of the Crown and the
</p>
<p>" existing laws give to the government, which shall not be exercised
</p>
<p>" for the purpose of maintaining the Union, the dissolution of which
</p>
<p>" involves not merely the repealing of an Act of Parliament, but the
</p>
<p>" dismemberment of the empire." A statement of the same nature
</p>
<p>was made on the same evening in the House of Lords, by the Duke
</p>
<p>of Wellington. So far then, as the opinion of the government is
</p>
<p>concerned it was pronounced unequivocally on that occasion, and it
</p>
<p>cannot be said that the proceedings suhsequent to that were carried
</p>
<p>on in ignorance of the determination of the government. If the pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings continued, they would be left to be determined by the tri-
</p>
<p>bunals of the country. About five days after that declaration in
</p>
<p>Parliament, on the 9th of May, the meeting at Mullingar took place.
</p>
<p>There were present on that occasion, Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Steele,
</p>
<p>Dr. Gray, and Mr. Barrett. There was an immense assemblage at
</p>
<p>that meeting. It was said by some of the defendants that it
</p>
<p>amounted to 100,000. I believe that the number was exaggerated,
</p>
<p>however it was a meeting of many thousands. They came to that
</p>
<p>meeting preceded by temperance bands, dressed in uniform ; and
</p>
<p>gentlemen, you will find in the course of the observations which I
</p>
<p>have to make that this was not considered by the defendants them-
</p>
<p>selves an unimportant circumstance. It is part of the system of
</p>
<p>military array ; and I regret much, that these temperance socie-
</p>
<p>ties have been involved in this political question with which the
</p>
<p>country has now for so many months been vexed. I cannot help
</p>
<p>saying, as I have adverted to this circumstance, that with respect to
</p>
<p>the Rev. Gentleman who first carried out that object, my strong be-
</p>
<p>lief is, that he was influenced by none but the purest and best
</p>
<p>motives. But though 1 believe that to be the case, others have
</p>
<p>taken advantage of that which was intended for no political object,
</p>
<p>and have turned it to political purposes. It is singular, that in this

</p>
<p>respect also, they had in their recollection the advice given by the
</p>
<p>leaders of the United Irishmen, as to the importance in carrying out
</p>
<p>their object, that sobriety should be part of their system ; these
</p>
<p>societies were organized thoughout the country; of this, advantage
</p>
<p>has been taken, and these bands have formed part of these proces-
</p>
<p>sions. At that meeting, there were banners floating from the
</p>
<p>windows and the house tops ; triumphal arches were erected, bearing
</p>
<p>inscriptions, among others: " A population of nine millions is too
</p>
<p>great to he dragged at the tail of' another nation;" "Repeal is
</p>
<p>coming," and other mottoes, which it is not necessary now to allude
</p>
<p>to. On the same day, a repeal dinner was given after the meeting,
</p>
<p>at which Mr. Barrett spoke as follows : ' Can they unrepeal us by
</p>
<p>" silencing us ? We know, England now knows, the world knows that
</p>
<p>" Ireland is united. How will they destroy that admitted fact, or
</p>
<p>" efface its record? We may be silent, but all the time it will be
</p>
<p>77
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>" the silence of the old woman's cow. We shall be the devil for
</p>
<p>" thinking, yet silent as gunpowder  smooth on the surface, only in-
</p>
<p>" dicating the depth of the waters. We will crouch, but it will be
</p>
<p>" the crouch of the tiger, ready to take the sure but terrible spring,
</p>
<p>" and clutch our independence. Come what may, the die is cast,
</p>
<p>" repeal must be successful. We have the cause, the leader, and the
</p>
<p>" country. A leader worthy of the people, and a people worthy of
</p>
<p>" the leader, sober, forbearing, resolved, and possessing all the vir-
</p>
<p>" tues which must enable them to attain, while rendering them worthy
</p>
<p>" of national independence! With such a cause, such a leader, peo-
</p>
<p>" pie, and clergy, who will despair ? " Again, in another part of his
</p>
<p>speech, he says : " There are moments in the life-time of nations
</p>
<p>" as individuals, which lead on to prosperous fortunes. If Ire-
</p>
<p>" land has missed former opportunities of regeneration, that is only
</p>
<p>" a warning not to miss another. The moment has arrived ; in-
</p>
<p>" stead of vain regrets over the past, let us seize on the present,
</p>
<p>" and take care that this neglected moment may not become the re-
</p>
<p>" gretted past of a future day. Irishmen, proceed in the mighty
</p>
<p>" work before you. To recede were ruin. Be firm, and you tri-
</p>
<p>" umph ; hesitate, and you fall. To suppose you would neglect your
</p>
<p>" present opportunities, would be to suppose you would ungratefully
</p>
<p>" neglect that refreshing cup of national independence and prosperity,
</p>
<p>" which Providence in its mercy seems at last to have presented to
</p>
<p>" your parched and feverish lips." These were the observations of Mr.
</p>
<p>Barrett. At the same meeting, Doctor Cantwell, a Roman Catholic
</p>
<p>Bishop, spoke as follows : " We have long enough, in vain, tried to
</p>
<p>" obtain justice from England, and it is time that we should endeavour
</p>
<p>" to right ourselves." And Bishop Higgins said, " I do not claim
</p>
<p>" any distinction, as standing by the Liberator, on the great question
</p>
<p>" of national independence. I entertain the opinion in common
</p>
<p>" with all the hierarchy of Ireland. Some, from delicacy of health,
</p>
<p>" and some from an unwillingness to mingle in politics, may not have
</p>
<p>" yet formally declared themselves, and I say all are repealers. Let

<p>" the foolish minister threaten ; I dare, I defy him to crush the re-
</p>
<p>" peal agitation in the diocese of Ardagh ; and if the scaffold were
</p>
<p>" my lot, I would bequeath my wrongs to my successor." That, I
</p>
<p>think, is strange language to fall from two ministers of a Christian
</p>
<p>Church.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the next meeting I shall call your attention to, is
</p>
<p>that which was held at Cork, on the 21st of May, at which Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell and Mr. Steele were present. It was said, that on that
</p>
<p>occasion, 500,000 persons were assembled. They met in the same
</p>
<p>manner as they had done at former multitudinous meetings, for the
</p>
<p>same object and the same design, to accustom those thousands to
</p>
<p>come from remote distances, to accustom them to obey commands,
</p>
<p>and to get them into a state of organization, by bringing them
</p>
<p>headed by bands, and in military array, in order that when the time of
</p>
<p>action should arrive, which I have before adverted to, they might be
</p>
<p>readv to come again and receive their orders. At the dinner, which
</p>
<p>78
</p>
<p>took place after the meeting, Mr. O'Connell said, " I have been,
</p>
<p>" while addressing you, looking into your minds, exchanging that
</p>
<p>" mental sympathy with you which 1 feel within me. Oh! to think
</p>
<p>" that in the year 1843, the repeal year, the rent should have accu-
</p>
<p>" mulated from 56 to 694 per week ; and I hope, that on Monday
</p>
<p>" next, or some succeeding day, it will be close on a thousand, and
</p>
<p>" perhaps more. [A voice  More power to you.] Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>"  More power to old Ireland ; that is power indeed. Some wise-
</p>
<p>" acres went to the Stock Exchange, which was going up until
</p>
<p>" repeal was whispered, and then they fell one and a half; and yet
</p>
<p>" they tell me that troops will be sent amongst the people." Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell in continuation said, " Let them attack us ; and if they do,
</p>
<p>" what will be the consequence ? What will be the state of the
</p>
<p>*' three-and-a half per cents ? If they will attack us, and that some
</p>
<p>" penniless, shoeless Irishman found his way on the deck of a
</p>
<p>" steamer, to Manchester or St. Giles's, and collected a number of
</p>
<p>" Irishmen about him, and one would ask him, ' what news ?' to
</p>
<p>" which he would reply, ' your father was cut down by a dragoon,
</p>
<p>" ' your mother was shot by a policeman, or your sister ; but I
</p>
<p>" ' will not say what has happened to her; she is now a wandering
</p>
<p>" ' maniac, warning her sex against the ruffian soldiery of Britain.'
</p>
<p>" Let him say but that, and I will ask Peel how many fires would
</p>
<p>" blaze out in the manufactories of England ? No ; they must dis-
</p>
<p>" cuss the question with us. They must listen to us. They will
</p>
<p>" not attempt to bully us, for it is not to be done. They shall not
</p>
<p>" attempt to massacre us. No! the hangman will be disappointed.
</p>
<p>" We are safe, for Ireland reposes in peace. Her thousands are
</p>
<p>" aroused ; and the peaceable arms are extended to heaven, incapa-
</p>
<p>" ble of being intimidated from joining in the offer I make you ; and
</p>
<p>" the time is come when I am enabled to make you that offer. I offer
</p>
<p>" you the repeal of the Union." This was the language used at the
</p>
<p>dinner, on the day, when it was said, half a million of the Irish people
</p>
<p>had arranged themselves in order and in military array, in the second
</p>
<p>city in the kingdom.

</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the next meeting I shall call your attention to is
</p>
<p>lhat which was held at Longford, on the 28th of May. I ab-
</p>
<p>stain from adverting to the object of those meetings, and the con-
</p>
<p>sequences arising from them, for this reason, as 1 shall not state
</p>
<p>my own views of their object, but I shall call your attention to the
</p>
<p>view which was taken and stated by one of the traversers. On
</p>
<p>that occasion, Mr. O'Connell and Mr. Steele were present. Thai
</p>
<p>meeting has been variously estimated in point of numbers, the lowest
</p>
<p>calculation being 60,000, and the highest 200,000. It is immaterial
</p>
<p>to my purpose, whether the meeting was one or the other. It was
</p>
<p>a meeting collected from seven counties, which embraced the dio-
</p>
<p>cese of Dr. Higgins, Longford, Leitrim, Sligo, Roscommon, King's
</p>
<p>County, Meath, and Cavan. You have heard from the speech which
</p>
<p>I have already read, what were the sentiments of Dr. Higgins, with
</p>
<p>respect to the opinion about repeal of the Union, in his own diocese.
</p>
<p>At this meeting) the multitudes were collected from no less than
</p>
<p>79
</p>
<p>seven counties, and the different parties came headed by bands,
</p>
<p>dressed in uniform, of which there were no less than eight, some of
</p>
<p>whom had travelled from twenty to thirty miles. The platform on
</p>
<p>that occasion was surmounted by a device which required no expla-
</p>
<p>nation, and was sufficiently intelligible to the people : " Ireland
</p>
<p>for the Irish, and the Irish for Ireland." I believe that is a state-
</p>
<p>ment which it is perfectly unnecessary to explain, it explains itself.
</p>
<p>There were banners also appearing in the town bearing mottoes,
</p>
<p>among which was this : " A population of nine millions is too great
</p>
<p>to be dragged at the tail of another nation." The Rev. Mr. Dawson
</p>
<p>proposed a resolution at that meeting ; he said : " Why should Ire-
</p>
<p>" land be treated worse than Australia ? that colony has had her re-
</p>
<p>" presentations attended to  she is treated so because she is capable
</p>
<p>" of being the successful rival of England. Are not the feelings of
</p>
<p>" Irishmen to be attended to and respected ? Would France, Ame-
</p>
<p>" rica, and other foreign powers sit quietly by and see the rights of
</p>
<p>" Irishmen trampled under foot?" What was meant by this inquiry?
</p>
<p>This is part of the attempt to create disaffection amongst Her Ma-
</p>
<p>jesty's subjects, by representing them as trampled on, and that they
</p>
<p>never would be righted by the Parliament but by the interference of
</p>
<p>foreign nations  France and America. At that meeting Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell said : " We shall not be in the slightest degree in fault, for we
</p>
<p>" will not violate any law whatever ; but I will tell you what, if they
</p>
<p>" attack us, then who will be the cowards? We will put them in the
</p>
<p>" wrong, and if they attack, then in your name I set them at defi-
</p>
<p>" ance." That was to say in other words, if they do permit us to
</p>
<p>organize the country from north to south and from east to west ; to
</p>
<p>hold those multitudinous meetings in all parts of the country, because
</p>
<p>I call them legal, I will take care there shall be nothing done at pre-
</p>
<p>sent until we have the organization complete, but if they attack us I
</p>
<p>will put them in the wrong, and set them at defiance. A dinner took
</p>
<p>place on the same day, at which Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Steele and Mr.
</p>
<p>Barrett were present. Mr. O'Connell at that dinner made some ob-
</p>
<p>servations which I shall now read to you, although they area repetition

</p>
<p>of the observations made at Cork. He commences by an allusion to
</p>
<p>Lord Beaumont : " I ask you, mongrel, heartless Beaumont, do you
</p>
<p>" want it to go through the people of Ireland that you would support
</p>
<p>" the English minister if he had been mad enough to make war upon
</p>
<p>" the Catholics of Ireland? Suppose some Irish Paddy had escaped
</p>
<p>'' from the slaughter, and going over to London, had met some of his
</p>
<p>" former neighbours ; they would ask him the news, but what would
</p>
<p>" be the tidings he would have to bring them ? He should say to
</p>
<p>" one, 'Jemmy, your father has been killed ;' 'Tom, your brother has
</p>
<p>" been shot.' A third would ask him, ' but my sister Eleanor ' does she
</p>
<p>" live?' he would say, ' your sister is not dead.' 'But is my father alive?'
</p>
<p>" ' No, your sister watches his corpse, but she is herself worse than
</p>
<p>" ' dead ; she is now a sad maniac roaming through the wilds, and like
</p>
<p>" ' the wretched maniac of song warning her sex against the ruffian
</p>
<p>" 'soldiery of Britain.' Yes, my Lord Beaumont, the brother of El-
</p>
<p>80
</p>
<p>" len O'Moore would be near your castle; he would hear that you
</p>
<p>" were one of the men who hallooed on the destroyer of the peace
</p>
<p>" of his home. Oh, you would be very safe that evening, would you
</p>
<p>" not, Lord Beaumont? The manufactories in your neighbourhood
</p>
<p>" would be safe too, and proud London herself, in which you would
</p>
<p>" flatter yourself with the hope of being secure, would be also safe
</p>
<p>" when the account of the ruin of Ireland would arrive. No  one
</p>
<p>" blaze of powerful fire would reach through her vast extent, and
</p>
<p>" the destruction of England would vindicate the country of the
</p>
<p>" maddened and persecuted Irishman who would have reached her
</p>
<p>" shores." Now, Gentlemen of the Jury, I would ask you did
</p>
<p>you ever in the course of your life, on any occasion, or at any
</p>
<p>time, or in any country in the world, hear so inflammatory a speech,
</p>
<p>and one so calculated to excite the strongest feelings of the excitable
</p>
<p>population of this country ? You will observe that in that speech he
</p>
<p>calls the Queen's troops the ruffian soldiery of Great Britain, you will
</p>
<p>find him presently endeavouring to correct that statement, and repre-
</p>
<p>senting that he did not use those words; but why he did so, you will
</p>
<p>perfectly understand before I close. On the 30th of May a meeting
</p>
<p>of the Association took place, at which five of the traversers attended,
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Steele, Dr. Gray, Mr. John O'Connell and Mr.
</p>
<p>Ray. Upon that occasion Mr. O'Connell said: "A typographical
</p>
<p>" error has occurred in the report in the Freeman's Journal of the
</p>
<p>" proceedings at Longford. I did not call the soldiery of Britain a
</p>
<p>" ruffian soldiery ; I would not do so, because it would be false, they
</p>
<p>" are, on the contrary, an extremely civilized class of men. I never now
</p>
<p>" see a soldier in the dock charged with any crime. When I was
</p>
<p>" called to the bar that was not the case ; there used to be then
</p>
<p>" three, five, and sometimes seven soldiers charged with breaches of
</p>
<p>" the law, but for a number of years it is not so ; we never now see a
</p>
<p>" soldier in the dock, and I would be wronging my judgment if I called
</p>
<p>" them a ruffian soldiery. The sergeants are a most deserving body
</p>

<p>" in which one of them ought not to be raised to the rank of an offi-
</p>
<p>" cer." As I proceed, gentlemen, you will understand this correction.
</p>
<p>In the Pilot newspaper of the 31st of May, Mr. Barrett, one of the
</p>
<p>traversers, takes the opportunity of reminding the repeal public, that
</p>
<p>this journal would be sent to each locality where 20 was subscribed.
</p>
<p>I advert to this to shew that Mr. Barrett, Mr. Duffy, and Dr. Gray,
</p>
<p>used those newspapers not merely for the purpose of circulating the
</p>
<p>news but that they were instrumental in forwarding this conspiracy.
</p>
<p>The next meeting which I shall refer to, took place at Drogheda,
</p>
<p>on the 3rd of June. There were present on that occasion, Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell, Mr. Steele, Mr. Barrett, and the Rev. Mr. Tyrrell (who
</p>
<p>is now dead). There was a procession through the streets ;
</p>
<p>bands, dressed as usual in uniforms, accompanied the procession.
</p>
<p>The streets were decorated with green boughs, and several thousands
</p>
<p>of persons were present. There were flags and banners bearing
</p>
<p>81
</p>
<p>mottoes  among them, A nation resolved to be free has only to
</p>
<p>will it. The wild shout of Ireland calls for repeal. We are Irish-
</p>
<p>men determined to be free  We are nine millions  A population
</p>
<p>of nine millions is too great to be dragged at the tail of any nation.
</p>
<p>A clear demonstration of the objects of those assembled thousands,
</p>
<p>to carry out these principles by the exhibition of physical force,
</p>
<p>and by an organization which must ultimately be arrived at. Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell in his address to the people said, " I want Ireland for the
</p>
<p>" Irish, I am sick of seeing this lovely land misgoverned by Saxon
</p>
<p>" foreigners. I want to see Irishmen, men born and reared in
</p>
<p>" Ireland, and who have the true Irish stuff in them, making laws for
</p>
<p>" the Irish people. I have addressed my countrymen by thousands,
</p>
<p>" in Sligo, Longford, Cork and other places. I am going to
</p>
<p>" Tipperary, Kilkenny, Mallow, Ennis, Skibbereen, and Galway.
</p>
<p>" Wherever I go, but one cry is reverberated, a thrilling shout for
</p>
<p>" repeal." In another part of his speech he called on them to give
</p>
<p>three cheers for the army, and they would in return get nothing
</p>
<p>but civility from them. On the same day a dinner was given at
</p>
<p>which Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Steele, and Mr. Barrett were present.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett at that dinner, in reply to a toast said : " But let him
</p>
<p>" beware how he (speaking of the Duke of Wellington) by aggres-
</p>
<p>" sion puts the people in the right, and causes a simultaneous out-
</p>
<p>" break. Mere men of office cannot comprehend the power of a
</p>
<p>" people. Military tacticians are out of their element in such a war-
</p>
<p>" fare. Office men or veterans never suspected that the Swiss peasantry
</p>
<p>" would be capable of throwing off the yoke of Austria. The boys of
</p>
<p>" Paris won the three days. Belgium threw off the yoke of Holland,
</p>
<p>" through what martinets would call an undisciplined rabble. The
</p>
<p>" women of Paris took the Bastile: even in that execrable French
</p>
<p>" Revolution there was one redeeming trait ; that enthusiasm set
</p>
<p>" at nought all the old military calculations, and surmounted what
</p>
<p>" were deemed obstacle's physically incompatible with success.
</p>
<p>" When the despot of the continent leagued against republican
</p>
<p>" France, and England cut off her com munications by sea, she

</p>
<p>" was deficient in saltpetre, a needful ingredient for gunpowder.
</p>
<p>" They thought she was helpless. Enthusiasm gave the motive 
</p>
<p>M science came to the aid of patriotism  the chemists of France
</p>
<p>" set their wits to work  saltpetre was extracted from old walls,
</p>
<p>" and many other unexplored materials, and France worsted the
</p>
<p>" allies at the Batttle of Jemappe. Was there ever a country so
</p>
<p>" circumstanced as Ireland for repelling aggression; with a numerous,
</p>
<p>" brave, sober, and multitudinous people ? Every mountain a citadel,
</p>
<p>" every hill a fort, every ditch a breastwork, every valley a ravine 
</p>
<p>" a country in which cannon or cavalry could not act, and where
</p>
<p>" all warfare must be inevitably irregular." At the same dinner
</p>
<p>Mr. Steele said, " that if Ireland and Ireland's leader were compel-
</p>
<p>" led to resistance, as he had for so many years above all others
</p>
<p>" laboured to keep the peace of Ireland, he would in that case
</p>
<p>" find it a duty to his country, and to his character, to solicit from
</p>
<p>M
</p>
<p>82
</p>
<p>" his august friend, O'Connell, that he would appoint him to the lea-
</p>
<p>" dership of whatever enterprises were the most desperate, to set an
</p>
<p>" example to the Irish, and give proof to the Irish, that although for
</p>
<p>" years he had heen keeping the peace of the country, he was ready
</p>
<p>" to share their dangers, if Ireland was driven to extremity by the
</p>
<p>" Oliver Cromwells of the day." There is not much difficulty in un-
</p>
<p>derstanding Mr. Barrett and Mr. Steele on that occasion. They
</p>
<p>distinctly meant to excite the people to look to themselves for law,
</p>
<p>not to the Parliament; so that when the period had arrived, they
</p>
<p>might be ready to take advantage of the difficulties England might
</p>
<p>be engaged in, if they thought fit. The concluding toast at the
</p>
<p>Drogheda dinner was : " The repeal press of Ireland, the most pow-
</p>
<p>erful auxiliary which Mr. O'Connell had in his undertaking," to
</p>
<p>which toast Mr. Barrett returned thanks.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the next meeting I shall call your attention to, was
</p>
<p>held at Kilkenny, on the 8th of June, at which Mr. O'Connell, Mr.
</p>
<p>Steele, and Mr. John O'Connell attended. There was represented
</p>
<p>to be present on that occasion, upwards of 300,000 persons ; the
</p>
<p>same bands, the same array, and the same display of physical force.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, on that occasion, gave three cheers for the Queen's
</p>
<p>army, the bravest army in the world, and stated, that the sergeants
</p>
<p>were the most intelligent of their class, and he hoped they would
</p>
<p>soon become officers. At a dinner given on the same day, at which
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Steele, and Mr. John O'Connell were present,
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell said : " What a waste of physical force have we not
</p>
<p>" witnessed to day? We stand at the head of a body of men, that,
</p>
<p>" if organized by military discipline, would be quite abundant for the
</p>
<p>" conquest of Europe. Wellington had never such an army as we
</p>
<p>" saw to-day. There were not at Waterloo, on both sides, so many
</p>
<p>" stout, active, energetic men as we saw here to-day. Oh ! but it
</p>
<p>" will be said they are not disciplined ; if you tell them what to do,
</p>
<p>" you will have them all disciplined in an hour. Don't you think that
</p>
<p>" they are as well able to walk in order after a band, as if they
</p>
<p>" wore red coats, and that they would be as ready to obey the re-

</p>
<p>" peal wardens as if they were called sergeants and captains ?" This
</p>
<p>is in substance the language I adverted to in a former part of my
</p>
<p>statement ; " you are to organize the men, you are to be called repeal
</p>
<p>wardens, and your commission a diploma ;" and they are to be
</p>
<p>ready to march after those repeal wardens, as if they were captains
</p>
<p>or sergeants.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I shall next call your attention to an article pub-
</p>
<p>lished by Mr. Duffy, in the Nation, of the 10th of June, by which
</p>
<p>you will see the community of purpose and design among those
</p>
<p>parties. The article I allude to, is headed " The Morality of War,"
</p>
<p>or it should more properly be called " the morality of rebellion."
</p>
<p>It commences thus : " We have received through that excellent
</p>
<p>" gentleman, Mr. Haughton, a letter from Mr. Ebenezer Shackle-
</p>
<p>" ton, expostulating through him with the Repeal Association, for
</p>
<p>" putting the glorious names of Benburb, Limerick, Beal-an-Athla,
</p>
<p>83
</p>
<p>" Buidh, and Clonlarf, on the repeal card. For these names, he
</p>
<p>" would substitute temperance, peace, and the like. Now, we have
</p>
<p>" much respect for this gentleman's opinions, but we entirely dissent
</p>
<p>" from them. We think them unfounded and mischievous, though
</p>
<p>" most benevolently meant by him. Unjust war is, like all other
</p>
<p>" unjust things, very wicked and condemnable. But a just war is as
</p>
<p>" noble to him, who has justice on his side, as any other just act;
</p>
<p>" nay, it is more noble ; for there is more of self-restraint, more
</p>
<p>" contempt of bodily suffering, more of high impulse, more of great-
</p>
<p>" ness achieved for its own great sake ; more, in short, of heroism
</p>
<p> in war than in almost any other human occupation. This is the
</p>
<p>" case to some extent in all wars, but increases as the justice of
</p>
<p>" the cause, and the efforts of the just combatant increase. But his
</p>
<p>" cause must be good to justify our unqualified praise of the soldier.
</p>
<p>" If he fight to rob or oppress ; if he fight in the ranks of an invader
</p>
<p>" or a tyrant ; if he fight against the cause of liberty, and against the
</p>
<p>" land that gave him birth, may his banner be trampled, and his
</p>
<p>" sword broken in a disastrous battle, and may his name rot in eter-
</p>
<p>" nal infamy ! But if he fight for truth, country, and freedom, may
</p>
<p>" fortune smile on his arms, may victory charge by his side, may
</p>
<p>" wealth, strength, and honour wait on him and his, if he survive his
</p>
<p>" conquest ; and, if he fall in achieving it, may glory sit upon his
</p>
<p>" tomb, and may a grateful country cherish those he loved ! War,
</p>
<p>" the exposure of ourselves to wounds, toil, and death, is as much
</p>
<p>" our duty in a just cause, as any other mode of sustaining justice.
</p>
<p>" We are as surely bound to encounter the march, the watch, the
</p>
<p>" breach, and the battle-field, for country, altars, friends, rights, and
</p>
<p>" freedom, as we are to sustain our parent, defend our wives and
</p>
<p>" children, and adhere to our religion and virtue, by any other less
</p>
<p>u hazardous means. War may be very often unnecessarily employed;
</p>
<p>" and so may love, anger, law, teaching, or any other human act of
</p>
<p>" feeling. Moral agitation has its woes as well as war. Ruined for-
</p>
<p>" tunes, broken friendships, the wreck of hopes, and the tearing of
</p>
<p>" ties dearer than life, have followed some of those religious and

</p>
<p>" social changes effected by moral means, and which, notwithstanding,
</p>
<p>" all men wisely and justly unite to honour. We have now done
</p>
<p>" with the subject ; we shall not return to it. We feel no wish to
</p>
<p>" encourage the occasion of war ; but whenever the occasion comes,
</p>
<p>" here or elsewhere, may sagacious and informed souls, bold hearts
</p>
<p>" and strong arms, be found to plan, lead, and fight! May the ex-
</p>
<p>" amples of Miltiades and Washington never want imitators where
</p>
<p>" there are tyrants to invade, freemen to defend, or slaves to struggle
</p>
<p>" for liberty! We recommend the following passage, from a grave
</p>
<p>" and able, and one of the latest English historians, to our readers :
</p>
<p>" ' Besides, economy and the military virtues are the great supports
</p>
<p>" ' of national existence, as food and exercise support our individual
</p>
<p>" * bodies. I grant that the existence so supported may be worthless,
</p>
<p>" ' may be sinful ; yet self-preservation is an essential condition of all
</p>
<p>" ' virtue. In order to do their duty, both states and individuals
</p>
<p>" ' must first live and be kept alive. But, more than all this, econo-
</p>
<p>84
</p>
<p>" ' mical and military questions are not purely external ; they are
</p>
<p>" ' connected closely with moral good and evil. A faulty, political
</p>
<p>" ' economy is the fruitful parent of crime ; a sound military
</p>
<p>" ' system is no mean school of virtue ; and war, as I have said
</p>
<p>"'before, has in its vicissitudes, and much more in the moral
</p>
<p>" ' qualities which it calls into action, a deep and abiding interest for
</p>
<p>" ' every one worthy of the name of man.'" Gentlemen, I ask you,
</p>
<p>having read that article, was I not justified in calling it the morality
</p>
<p>of rebellion ?
</p>
<p>The next meeting to which I shall advert, is the one which
</p>
<p>took place at Mallow. I merely allude to several of those meet-
</p>
<p>ings, not wishing to occupy more of the public time than neces-
</p>
<p>sary. At that meeting, Mr. O'Connell and Mr. Steele were pre-
</p>
<p>sent. It took place on the 11th of June, 1843. There were
</p>
<p>present on that occasion about 300,000 persons. Several tem-
</p>
<p>perance bands attended at that meeting, and the same organization
</p>
<p>was observed by those masses of persons which had been at other
</p>
<p>meetings. Mr. O'Connell addressed the meeting, and amongst
</p>
<p>other observations, he spoke as follows: " I love and honour the
</p>
<p>" Queen's army ; they are the bravest in the world. They are
</p>
<p>" welcome wherever they go. The officers are gay and gallant
</p>
<p>" young gentlemen. The sergeants are the first in the world ; and
</p>
<p>" I regret that the custom does not prevail in the British army which
</p>
<p>" prevails in the French, of giving commissions to sergeants. In
</p>
<p>" France, no man is an officer who has not first served as a sergeant,
</p>
<p>" and who has not been recommended for his good conduct ; and,
</p>
<p>" with respect to the private soldiers, I will say, that when called to
</p>
<p>" the bar, I remember many of them tried for offences; for the last
</p>
<p>" twenty years, however, crime has considerably diminished among
</p>
<p>" them ; and for the last ten years, I have scarcely heard of one of
</p>
<p>" them being in the dock, or tried for any offence." At the dinner,
</p>
<p>on that occasion, he spoke as follows : " But yet do you know I
</p>
<p>" never felt such a loathing for speechifying as I do at present ;
</p>
<p>" the time is come when we must be doing. You may soon learn

</p>
<p>" the alternative to live as slaves or to die as freemen. No,
</p>
<p>" you will not be freemen, if you be not perfectly in the right and
</p>
<p>" your enemies in the wrong. I think. I perceive a fixed disposi-
</p>
<p>" tion on the part of some of our Saxon traducers to put us to the
</p>
<p>" test. The efforts already made by them have been most abortive
</p>
<p>" and ridiculous. In the midst of peace and tranquillity they are
</p>
<p>" covering over our land with troops. Yes, I speak with the awful
</p>
<p>" determination with which I commenced my address, in conse-
</p>
<p>" quence of the news received this day. There was no House of
</p>
<p>" Commons on Thursday, for the cabinet was considering what they
</p>
<p>" should do, not for Ireland but against her. If they assailed us to-
</p>
<p>" morrow, and that we conquered them, as conquer them we will one
</p>
<p>" day, the first use of that victory which we would make, would be
</p>
<p>" to place the sceptre in the hands of her who has ever showed us
</p>
<p>" favour, and whose conduct has ever been full of sympathy and
</p>
<p>85
</p>
<p>" emotion for our sufferings." The sceptre is to be placed in the
</p>
<p>hands of the Sovereign by those connected with this conspiracy.
</p>
<p>You must recollect that her Majesty is a branch of the legislature of
</p>
<p>the Kings, Lords and Commons established by the articles and terms
</p>
<p>of the Act of Union, and yet they are to wrest from her her power
</p>
<p>and authority, and of their own free will to place the sceptre in her
</p>
<p>hands upon such terms as they may choose, and these are the pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings of " The Loyal National Repeal Association." In another
</p>
<p>part of his speech he says: " Have we not the ordinary courage of
</p>
<p>" Englishmen ? Are we to be trampled under foot ? Oh, they
</p>
<p>" shall never trample me at least ; I was wrong, they may trample
</p>
<p>" me under foot, I say they may trample me, but it shall be my dead
</p>
<p>" body they will trample on, not the living man. They have taken
</p>
<p>** one step of coercion, and may I ask them what is to prevent them
</p>
<p>" from taking another ? May not they send us to the West
</p>
<p>" Indies, as they have lately emancipated the negroes, to fill up their
</p>
<p>" places. Oh! it is not an imaginary case at all, for the onlyEnglish-
</p>
<p>" man that ever possessed Ireland sent eighty thousand Irishmen to
</p>
<p>" work as slaves, every one of whom perished in the short space of
</p>
<p>" twelve years beneath the ungenial sun of the Indies. Yes, Peel
</p>
<p>" and Wellington may be second Cromwells ; they may get his
</p>
<p>" blunted truncheon and they may, oh sacred Heaven, enact on the
</p>
<p>" fair occupants of that gallery the murder of the Wexford ladies."
</p>
<p>Gracious God ! was ever heard such an attempt to create between
</p>
<p>fellow-subjects of the same Queen, feelings of hatred to be excited
</p>
<p>against those whom they were taught to consider their Saxon op-
</p>
<p>pressors. Is it to be tolerated in a country where the law is in force,
</p>
<p>that proceedings such as this should be carried on ? I ask you,
</p>
<p>gentlemen of the Jury, who have a solemn duty to discharge, is the
</p>
<p>country to be handed over to those who would turn the govern-
</p>
<p>ment into a ferocious republic (to use the language of one of the
</p>
<p>ministers of the Crown), of which one of the traversers is to be the
</p>
<p>head ? Again in another part of that speech he says, " What is the
</p>
<p>" position in which I stand ? What are the enjoyments of life to

</p>
<p>" me, if I cannot vindicate my fame and free my country ? All that
</p>
<p>" is delightful, all that the enthusiasm of romance can fling round
</p>
<p><c the human heart is centred in my love for Ireland. She never has
</p>
<p>" been a nation ; for her own children had her split and rent and
</p>
<p>" divided, when the Saxon first polluted her verdant soil with his
</p>
<p>" accursed foot. From that day to this dissensions and divisions,
</p>
<p>" together with a false confidence in the honour of the enemy, and
</p>
<p>" penal laws, all have contributed to keep her in peril and degrada-
</p>
<p>" tion ; but the hour is come when her people can be a nation ; and
</p>
<p>" if they follow the counsel that they have got, their country will be
</p>
<p>" free and will be their own. I feel it now my duty to warn you against
</p>
<p>" these Saxons ; perhaps a few days will tell us what they mean
</p>
<p>" to do. I hope my dream of conflict will never be realized ; that
</p>
<p>" it is an empty vision : but let none of us be to blame. Let us
</p>
<p>" stand shoulder to shoulder on the constitution, and let not Ireland
</p>
<p>86
</p>
<p>" be abandoned to her foes by the folly, the passion, or the treachery
</p>
<p>" of her children."
</p>
<p>I now bring you, gentlemen, to a most important meeting, im-
</p>
<p>portant, because I believe it was the first meeting at which an asser-
</p>
<p>tion was made by Mr. O'Connell, of the power of having the Union
</p>
<p>repealed without the aid of the United Legislature. He has stated
</p>
<p>this to be law, and I ask if among the numerous counsel for the
</p>
<p>traversers, there will be found a single man who will affirm that
</p>
<p>proposition ; yet the deluded people of this country are to be told
</p>
<p>that they are not to look to the Parliament to carry the object they
</p>
<p>have in view, and that it can be legally obtained without doing so.
</p>
<p>I ask you now to remember this, a proposition which I denounce in
</p>
<p>the face of the country, of this high court, and of the legal profession,
</p>
<p>to be illegal, unconstitutional, and unprofessional. This meeting
</p>
<p>was held on the 29th of June, at Dundalk. There was the usual
</p>
<p>number of temperance bands, all in uniform, the same organization
</p>
<p>as at other meetings. Several thousands of people were collected.
</p>
<p>At that meeting a tricoloured flag was displayed with the inscription,
</p>
<p>" Ireland in mass resists her foes." On the same day on which this
</p>
<p>meeting took place Mr. O'Connell said: "We have ascertained that
</p>
<p>" the Irish nation wills the Repeal of the Union, but still I do not
</p>
<p>" cease my exertions in calling together thousands of others ; I do
</p>
<p>" not cease or terminate these exertions with this day. No ! on next
</p>
<p>" Sunday week I attend a meeting, as multitudinous at least as we
</p>
<p>" had to-day, in Waterford, on that day week I will attend a
</p>
<p>" meeting in Tullamore, nearly in the centre of Ireland ; on that
</p>
<p>" day week again I shall attend another in Tuam, under the auspices
</p>
<p>" of one John Tuam ; and in a few days afterwards I shall attend
</p>
<p>" another meeting in Castlebar. I have not fixed the time for any
</p>
<p>" others yet, but I have been called upon to fix it, and in every one
</p>
<p>" of them there will be exhibited the same tranquil determination,
</p>
<p>" the same resolution that Ireland shall be a nation, the same deter-
</p>
<p>" mination never to abandon the pursuit of this sacred cause until it
</p>
<p>" ends in success. And I want to know what power under heaven,

</p>
<p>" and adding to it the fiends of hell, can prevent us from obtaining
</p>
<p>" our nationality when all Ireland wishes for it ? It may be asked
</p>
<p>" why I should take the superfluous trouble of attending those other
</p>
<p>" meetings ; but I attend them not to convince myself or you that
</p>
<p>" Ireland is with me, but to convince our enemies ; to convince the
</p>
<p>" British statesmen ; to make the Duke of Wellington aware of it,
</p>
<p>" bothered as the poor old man is. I want to make all Europe and
</p>
<p>" America know it. I want to make England feel her weakness if
</p>
<p>" she refuse to give us the justice we require, the restoration of our
</p>
<p>" domestic parliament." But do they imagine that I intend to stop
</p>
<p>" at calling those meetings ? If those meetings do not procure some-
</p>
<p>" thing, I am bound to do something substantial, and the basis of the
</p>
<p>" movement to effect that object is to be found in those meetings. They
</p>
<p>" are satisfying both friends and foes that the nation is with me, man
</p>
<p>" for man with me,aye, and ready if it were necessary, to perish to the
</p>
<p>" last man. Nothing could justify the exercise of the sentiment thus
</p>
<p>'- proclaimed, but the inevitable necessity created by an attack on us,
</p>
<p>" and I have the pleasure to tell you that we are too strong to be at-
</p>
<p>" tacked. Sometimes there comes over me a temptation, and I almost
</p>
<p>" am induced to wish they would attack us ; but I promise you a per-
</p>
<p>" feet certainty that they will not venture to do it, and there is no
</p>
<p>" concealing the certainty that if they did attack us, the result would
</p>
<p>" not be doubtful. I am not afraid of not getting a substantial por-
</p>
<p>" tion of the North, and then the national movement will be com-
</p>
<p>" plete, and the next step is to be taken. I shall tell you what I mean
</p>
<p>" to do ; we have already published the plan for the new Irish parlia-
</p>
<p>" ment, and selected the places that ought to return members, taking
</p>
<p>" up the population in 1831, so there will be no favour to any per-
</p>
<p>" son. Every town with nine thousand inhabitants will have a mem-
</p>
<p>" ber, and that, with the county members of parliament, would make
</p>
<p>" three hundred. I will request that every one of those places will
</p>
<p>" collect the sum of one hundred pounds, and send an individual with
</p>
<p>" that sum to Dublin. If there be any of those towns that will not
</p>
<p>" make that sacrifice, they would not deserve to have members in the
</p>
<p>" Irish parliament. If the individuals that would be selected are not
</p>
<p>" ready to make that sacrifice themselves for the town, they will not
</p>
<p>" deserve to be returned for the town hereafter. I will have ray three
</p>
<p>" hundred gentlemen assembled in Dublin; their occupation will be
</p>
<p>" to bring the money, and thus make a treasury, and then as the law
</p>
<p>" requires it, they can dissolve themselves, and there is nothing to pre-
</p>
<p>" vent me from inviting my two hundred and ninety nine companions
</p>
<p>" next day to a public banquet, at which no persons will attend but
</p>
<p>" them and me. And I do not see why we should not form a cham-
</p>
<p>" ber of consultation  not of deputies, to arrange the terms of the
</p>
<p>" repeal of the Union. I have formed this plan with the Convention
</p>
<p>" Act before me, riding the three hundred members through every
</p>
<p>" clause of it. There remains then only the assent of the Sovereign
</p>
<p>" to be procured ; and I tell you the Irish parliament can be revived
</p>
<p>" legally and constitutionally, by the mere exercise of the preroga-
</p>
<p>" tive of the Crown in issuing the writs, and without going to the
</p>
<p>" British Parliament at all. It is only necessary to have them sealed

<p>" by the Lord Chancellor as keeper of the great seal. Sugden would
</p>
<p>" do it at once if he were paid for it. When the Chancellor is di-
</p>
<p>" rected he will seal the writs for the return of the Irish parliament,
</p>
<p>" and by the return to those writs the parliament will be again estab-
</p>
<p>*' lished in College-green. The plan is quite simple, but it requires
</p>
<p>" the nation to back me to enable me to carry it out, and I will have
</p>
<p>" the nation to aid me. Let no person dispute that right of the
</p>
<p>" Queen who is not prepared to dispute her right to the throne."
</p>
<p>That assertion was made to delude the people, who had been told
</p>
<p>from time to time by the late ministry, and by the present, who had
</p>
<p>been told by an overwhelming majority in Parliament, that they
</p>
<p>would not listen to a step which would lead to a dismemberment of
</p>
<p>the empire. They are told that the moment their organization is
</p>
<p>complete, the Queen may issue writs for summoning an Irish Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment. They are told this by a gentleman of standing and eminence
</p>
<p>88
</p>
<p>in his profession at the bar, and Mr. O'Connell is in this singu-
</p>
<p>lar position, either he did not believe what he then stated to those
</p>
<p>assembled thousands, or if he did, will any of his counsel assert it
</p>
<p>now ? I will now advert to the Aet of Union, for the purpose of
</p>
<p>ascertaining whether or not that opinion is well founded. By the
</p>
<p>third article of the Act of Union, it. was provided that the said United
</p>
<p>Kingdom be represented in one Parliament, to be styled, " The
</p>
<p>Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,"
</p>
<p>and in a portion of the fourth article in the same Act it was pro-
</p>
<p>vided, " that when his Majesty, his heirs, or successors, shall de-
</p>
<p>" dare his, her, or their pleasure for holding the first, or any sub-
</p>
<p>" sequent Parliament of the United Kingdom, a proclamation shall
</p>
<p>" issue under the great seal of the United Kingdom, to cause the
</p>
<p>" Lords spiritual and temporal, and Commons, who are to serve in the
</p>
<p>" Parliament thereof on the part of Ireland, to be returned in such
</p>
<p>" manner as by Act of this present session of the Parliament of
</p>
<p>" Ireland shall be provided ; and that the Lords spiritual and tem-
</p>
<p>" poral and Commons of Great Britain shall, together with the Lords
</p>
<p>" spiritual and temporal, and Commons so returned as aforesaid on
</p>
<p>" the part of Ireland, constitute the two houses of the Parliament of
</p>
<p>" the United Kingdom." Thus we have these articles ratified,
</p>
<p>approved of, and confirmed by the parliament of Ireland, one of
</p>
<p>those being that the Irish nation being represented in the Par-
</p>
<p>liament of England, it should be the sole Parliament of the United
</p>
<p>Kingdom ; and yet in direct opposition to this legal enactment
</p>
<p>of the King, Lords, and Commons of this country, confirmed by an
</p>
<p>Act of the English legislature, having this distinct provision uniting
</p>
<p>the Parliament of both countries for ever, you are told that it is
</p>
<p>apart of the prerogative of the Crown, without the assent of Par-
</p>
<p>liament, to summon an Irish Parliament  an Irish Parliament 
</p>
<p>in Ireland, and you are told that any person that denies that, de-
</p>
<p>nies the title to the throne. Now, I ask again, if there is one
</p>
<p>counsel among the numerous bar at the other side who will state
</p>
<p>that the Act of Union is void ? I am aware that it has been stated
</p>

</p>
<p>on many occasions by the same authority that the Union is void ;
</p>
<p>but 1 reiterate that no lawyer can say that the prerogative can ex-
</p>
<p>tend to what has been held in that language to be within it. It is
</p>
<p>a delusion, practised on the people of this country, to assert that
</p>
<p>the prerogative of the Crown could be so exercised, and yet that
</p>
<p>language was held by the parties who said they Ujight crouch, but
</p>
<p>that it would be the crouch of the tiger, ready to spring on what
</p>
<p>came within his grasp.
</p>
<p>The next meeting to which I shall call your attention was held at
</p>
<p>Donnybrook, on the 3rd of July. There were several thousands of
</p>
<p>persons present, and there was the same arrangement there  the
</p>
<p>same organization, the same display of physical force. At that meeting
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, Mr. John O'Connell, Mr. Steele, and Dr. Gray,
</p>
<p>attended. On that occasion, Mr. O'Connell said, " What a glorious
</p>
<p>M sight is here ! What an awful assemblage ! 1 have seen many
</p>
<p>" mighty and majestic assemblies, but it has never happened to me
</p>
<p>89
</p>
<p>u to behold such an assemblage, as is congregated here to-day. It
</p>
<p>" is impossible for me to have more power  I have power enough 
</p>
<p>" the only question is, how to wield it ; I have more strength, more phv-
</p>
<p>" sical force than ever monarch commanded or general led. 1 have abun-
</p>
<p>" dance of physical force. All Ireland is rising as one mass. The mighty
</p>
<p>" movement has commenced from Cape Clear, and is extending itself
</p>
<p>" to the Giant's Causeway. The shout is re-echoed from Howth to
</p>
<p>" Connemara ; a voice is abroad on the wild winds of heaven, which
</p>
<p>" cries aloud : Repeal of the Union and liberty for Ireland. Old
</p>
<p>" Ireland and liberty. Yes, there is such a national uprising,
</p>
<p>" such a simultaneous declaration of opinion  such a manifestation
</p>
<p>" of popular determination  snch a national resolve recorded in the
</p>
<p>" presence of high heaven, announcing to the nations of the earth
</p>
<p>" that Ireland shall be free, and the Union repealed. All that is
</p>
<p>" requisite is to manage our strength. Let there be no riot, no
</p>
<p>" violence, no tumult, no breach of the peace. Let us exhibit
</p>
<p>" sobriety, order, tranquillity, all crowned by immortal, imperish-
</p>
<p>" able determination. We will have the country for ourselves."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, upon that occasion, as upon many others, you have it
</p>
<p>impressed upon the minds of the assembled multitudes, that there
</p>
<p>should be no riot, no turbulence, no violence, but peace was en-
</p>
<p>joined ; and it was for this reason which I shall state to you, that the
</p>
<p>conspiracy could not be carried on, if there was any riot, or violence,
</p>
<p>until the period had arived when the signal was to be given. At
</p>
<p>present and up to that period, the meetings were only to be used for
</p>
<p>the purpose of organization, and for the purpose of carrying their
</p>
<p>object, if possible, by the demonstration of physical force. He
</p>
<p>further stated : " You know as well as I do, there is one only way to
</p>
<p>" mortify the enemies of Ireland, and that is to continue peaceable,
</p>
<p>" and remain determined. Now I delight in the species of au-
</p>
<p>" thority I possess ; I know not how acquired. How pleased I
</p>
<p>" am with the readiness with which I am obeyed. I account for it
</p>
<p>" from the identity of all the people with me in the majestic strug-
</p>
<p>" gle to make Ireland a nation again, and to strike off the domi-

</p>
<p>" nion of the foe and foreigner." Strike off the dominion of Eng-
</p>
<p>land, repeal the Union between Great Britain and Ireland, Great
</p>
<p>Britain being the foe and foreigner. Again, -he says : " Yes, we
</p>
<p>" will not submit to be legislated for by such a country  the
</p>
<p>'' struggle in which we are engaged is one which will transmit our
</p>
<p>" glory to all ages, and render us illustrious among nations for having
</p>
<p>" achieved the liberty and independence of our native land ; Europe
</p>
<p>" is contemplating our struggle ; Africa on her sable shores hears the
</p>
<p>" name of the Irish leader, and sighs for a man of the same energy
</p>
<p>" to lead them from slavery to happiness and true enjoyment ; Ame-
</p>
<p>" rica has heard us. The Association meets to-morrow, and to-mor-
</p>
<p>" row I will hand in from America 1125 sterling. I think Welling-
</p>
<p>" ton will hear that with surprise, and I am sure Peel will with terror.
</p>
<p>" We will give the Americans an entire day, Monday, for their cor-
</p>
<p>" respondence and nothing else. We will show them how deep and
</p>
<p>" sincere is Irish gratitude. The voice of thankfulness will re-echo
</p>
<p>N
</p>
<p>90
</p>
<p>" from the shores of Ireland across the waves of the Atlantic, and
</p>
<p>" reverberate in the woods and on the lofty mountains of America,
</p>
<p>" testifying the delight with which the Irish receive this sympathy of
</p>
<p>" the Americans." Sympathy of a nation who stated through the
</p>
<p>son of its President, that the libation of a country's freedom must
</p>
<p>sometimes be quaffed in blood. " But (he continued) the assertion
</p>
<p>" to which I have alluded relative to the introduction of a bill into
</p>
<p>" Parliament for carrying repeal, is all a fallacy, for I have the satis-
</p>
<p>" faction to tell you, that it is not necessary that any such bill should
</p>
<p>" pass the Saxon senate. The Queen has it in her own power, at
</p>
<p>" any moment, to summon the Irish Parliament again into existence.
</p>
<p>" The first lawyers in the land, the lawyers most deeply versed in
</p>
<p>" matters relating to the spirit of the English Constitution, have given
</p>
<p>" their opinion to that effect. Saurin, Bushe, and Plunket have all
</p>
<p>" of them concurred in declaring the Irish Parliament had no legal
</p>
<p>" right to pass the act of Union. Such a proceeding on their part,
</p>
<p>" was at direct variance with the spirit of the Constitution, for men
</p>
<p>" who had the audacious presumption to barter a nation's birthright
</p>
<p>" had been sent into Parliament to make laws not to abolish legisla-
</p>
<p>" tures. Those great authorities denounced, in language of the most
</p>
<p>" fiery eloquence, the nefarious proceeding which was then in con-
</p>
<p>" temptation, and pronounced the Union to be void in point of law
</p>
<p>" and principle, inasmuch as it was an act which they who connived
</p>
<p>" at had no power or authority whatsoever to perform. Plunket,
</p>
<p>" with a force of imagery and a sublimity of language which it is im-
</p>
<p>" possible to commend too highly, declared that as well might the
</p>
<p>" frantic suicide imagine that the act whereby he destroyed his mi-
</p>
<p>" serable body could annihilate his immortal soul, as the Irish repre-
</p>
<p>" sentatives imagine that they had any power to spoliate Ireland of
</p>
<p>" her constitutional, inalienable right to have a Parliament of her
</p>
<p>" own. What is the consequence ? The consequence is, that the
</p>
<p>" fatal Act of 1800 was founded on no fundamental principle of the
</p>
<p>" Constitution, and that the Irish Parliament is not dead but only
</p>
<p>" sleepeth. The Queen, whom may God preserve and defend, could

</p>
<p>" give directions to her authorities in Ireland to-morrow to cause
</p>
<p>" the issue from Chancery, of writs for holding an Irish Parliament."
</p>
<p>Now what is the statement thereby conveyed to the congrega-
</p>
<p>ted and assembled thousands ; it is this  that Saurin, Bushe, and
</p>
<p>Plunket have declared the Act of Union void. I tell you, gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, they never said so ; they made these strong observations in
</p>
<p>their places in Parliament, before the Act had passed. They op-
</p>
<p>posed the passing of the Act, as they had a right to do, entertaining
</p>
<p>the views which they then did. Observations were made, during
</p>
<p>the debate, and among others, those eloquent words of Lord Plunket,
</p>
<p>and they are now cited, for the purpose of instilling into the minds
</p>
<p>of these misguided people, that those eminent persons had, after the
</p>
<p>Act of Union had passed, declared its invalidity, and thereby pro-
</p>
<p>nounced that, the Crown had authority to call an Irish Parliament.
</p>
<p>I deny that the Crown has a right to issue writs to summon an Irish
</p>
<p>Parliament. You will observe that this prerogative is asserted and
</p>
<p>supported by the allegation that such was the opinion of those great
</p>
<p>91
</p>
<p>and eminent men, not one of whom ever suggested such a notion.
</p>
<p>Those observations referred to were made hy them for the purpose
</p>
<p>of inducing the legislature not to pass the Act, and they are now
</p>
<p>made use of for the purpose of conveying to the minds of those
</p>
<p>assembled thousands, that they had declared the invalidity of the
</p>
<p>Union, and the existence of a prerogative to summon an Irish par-
</p>
<p>liament. Again, I reiterate my denial of that right ; the Crown has
</p>
<p>no such prerogative, and I say that the Act of Union is valid ; and it
</p>
<p>is somewhat singular, that the invalidity of this Act should be asserted
</p>
<p>by Irish Roman Catholics, when we consider, that if this Act be
</p>
<p>void, every subsequent Act of the Imperial Parliament is also void,
</p>
<p>among which, is the Roman Catholic Relief Bill. It is totally impossi-
</p>
<p>ble to contend that the Act of Union is a nullity, without asserting, for
</p>
<p>the purpose of supporting that proposition, that every subsequent Act
</p>
<p>which has been passed for the purpose of binding or affecting this
</p>
<p>country, is also a nullity ; and I ask, whether I am not justified in
</p>
<p>complaining, that an attempt should be made to delude the Irish
</p>
<p>people by the authority of those great names into the supposition
</p>
<p>that this was entertained as an opinion by them, when they never ex-
</p>
<p>pressed any such opinion ; and are they to be told, that although
</p>
<p>they can have no hope from the legislature, yet they can have it from
</p>
<p>the prerogative of the Crown. At that meeting, which took place at
</p>
<p>Donnybrook, Mr. O'Connell alluded to a remittance which he had
</p>
<p>received from America; and at a meeting of the Association, which
</p>
<p>was held on the 4th of July, on which occasion Mr. O'Connell, Mr.
</p>
<p>John O'Connell, Mr. Steele, and Dr. Gray were present, a day se-
</p>
<p>lected obviously, because it was the anniversary of the American
</p>
<p>independence, Mr. O'Connell said: " I shall next proceed to
</p>
<p>" hand in the sums of money I have received from America, and
</p>
<p>vW this is an auspicious day to talk of the Americans. This is the 4th
</p>
<p>" of July, the anniversary of their independence. I believe that
</p>
<p>" cheer will go on the western winds with the rapidity of the
</p>
<p>u lightning flash, and the force of the thunderbolt, and crossing the
</p>
<p>" thousands of miles of the broad Atlantic, be heard amongst the

</p>
<p>" towns, and along the rivers, and amidst the lofty mountains of
</p>
<p>" America. Oh ! how I pity the man that is not delighted at the
</p>
<p>" feeling that the Americans obtained their independence. They
</p>
<p>" did not turn out in wanton and violent rebellion, or commit any
</p>
<p>" aggression against the English power. No : on the contrary, they
</p>
<p>,! were submissive to the English power as long as they were permit-
</p>
<p>" ted to submit, until a tyrant monarch (and a greater tyrant never
</p>
<p>" filled the throne, both in intention and disposition, than George
</p>
<p>" the Third) compelled them to resist. The Americans suffered
</p>
<p>" every species of injury ; they were robbed of their rights ; they
</p>
<p>" were refused the privilege of self-legislation ; they endured every-
</p>
<p>" thing until England passed an act annihilating their domestic legis-
</p>
<p>" lature. They bore all until England attacked them with open arms ;
</p>
<p>u they then (and may God bless their posterity for it) resisted ; they
</p>
<p>" fought the good fight, and they conquered gloriously in the cause
</p>
<p>" of liberty and independence. I am sure that England has since
</p>
<p>92
</p>
<p>" grown wiser ; I know that she is weaker than she was tlien. I beg
</p>
<p>" to hand in the following sums :" he then handed 1125, the sum
</p>
<p>which had been received.
</p>
<p>The next meeting to which I shall allude, was held at Tullamore,
</p>
<p>on the 16th of July ; Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Steele, Mr. Barrett, and
</p>
<p>Dr. Gray were present. Twelve bands attended in uniform, from the
</p>
<p>King's County, the Queen's County, the County of Westmeath, and
</p>
<p>the County of Tipperary. 150,000 persons were present at the meet-
</p>
<p>ing. On an arch was this inscription: Ireland, her parliament, or the
</p>
<p>world in a blaze. On a flag : Ireland must no longer be a serf na-
</p>
<p>tion. The Rev. Mr. Kearney addressed that meeting in those words :
</p>
<p>They imagine that by a course of liberal government in Ireland
</p>
<p>they could put a stop to the repeal agitation ; by giving up the
</p>
<p>church temporalities, by enlarging the franchise and increasing the
</p>
<p>constituency in Ireland, they hope to detach us from the great and
</p>
<p>paramount consideration of this question. They might concede all
</p>
<p>these, and even more. Most likely they would tempt the Libera-
</p>
<p>tor with fair promises in addition to some good acts ; but he is too
</p>
<p>wise for them. He was never yet overreached by an English go-
</p>
<p>vernment : he has always been the watchful, wary, and undeceived
</p>
<p>advocate of his country's wrongs, and we may safely leave him to
</p>
<p>take everything that they give; but as soon as he gets all, never
</p>
<p>was the steam of Repeal up till then. Allow me then, not to take
</p>
<p>up your time any longer than to read the resolution." [shouts of
</p>
<p>' Repeal, Repeal, Repeal'] Mr. O'Connell.  "I rise to address you
</p>
<p>upon a new topic, that I scarcely ever touched on before. I have
</p>
<p>a new theme now to dilate upon, and it is with infinite pleasure
</p>
<p>that I now announce to you the certainty of our carrying the re-
</p>
<p>peal of the Union. When I addressed former multitudinous as-
</p>
<p>semblages of the people, I endeavoured to show them the advan-
</p>
<p>tages that would result from a repeal of the Union, that nothing
</p>
<p>would do good for Ireland but the restoration of her own Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment. Upon that topic I dilated often, and was able to demon-
</p>
<p>strate that Ireland must continue in misery unless she had her own

</p>
<p>parliament. My object was to excite them to exertion, and I threw
</p>
<p>in the ingredient of hope, because a struggle without hope is a vain
</p>
<p>and tedious operation; but now I need not talk of hopes, for I
</p>
<p>come here to announce the certainty of repeal. In my former ad-
</p>
<p>dresses I called upon the people to aid me in the struggle I was
</p>
<p>making; I continue that call still, but I have to add to it, that suc-
</p>
<p>cess is placed beyond all possibility of doubt. You have only to
</p>
<p>persevere and redouble your former exertions, if possible, and the
</p>
<p>battle will be won. We have got upon vantage ground, and must
</p>
<p>not only endeavour to keep it, but we must advance still further on
</p>
<p>(he road to victory, and it is as certain that we shall carry repeal as
</p>
<p>that the sun is now shining upon you. To be sure that certainty
</p>
<p>is to be attributed chiefly to our own simultaneous and multitudi-
</p>
<p>nous exertions, from which success, so far, has entirely resulted.
</p>
<p>Have I not teetotallers here? [' Yes.'] I am proud of your con-
</p>
<p>fidence. I can colled you together at any time. If I want you I
</p>
<p>93
</p>
<p>" can get you any day in the week  [A voice,  'The sooner you
</p>
<p>" want us the better']." Gentlemen, that will convey to your minds
</p>
<p>the feelings of this multitude ; " if you want us we will be ready to
</p>
<p>come." That is not the only meeting at which this question was put.
</p>
<p>That meeting separated peaceably, I admit, but it was because the
</p>
<p>time had not yet come, and to commit crime would give strength to
</p>
<p>the Saxon enemy, but " will you be ready to come when I want you
</p>
<p>again?" At the close of this address, he says : "Oh, little the Saxon
</p>
<p>" knows that gentleness of manner that arises under religious enthu-
</p>
<p>" siasm ; that forbearance that springs from the religious principle
</p>
<p>" deeply impressed upon your hearts from your earliest infancy. But
</p>
<p>" it is that very religious forbearance that makes you kind to each
</p>
<p>" other, and that enables your women to come into the greatest
</p>
<p>" throngs without being injured, and certain of not being insulted ;
</p>
<p>" but if it should be necessary for you to remain in the field till blood
</p>
<p>" should flow, general never stood by such soldiers. I have the
</p>
<p>" bravest and the most moral people to deal with ; but you must
</p>
<p>" combine ; there must be no treachery among you; and it is a trea-
</p>
<p>" chery to vote for any one but a repealer. I have heard of some
</p>
<p>" parish in this county where some repealers voted for a Tory ; how-
</p>
<p>" ever, we will say no more about it at present ; but now I give com-
</p>
<p>" mand never to vote for any Tory, nor for any one else but a re-
</p>
<p>" pealer. A friend of mine was coming down from Dublin and saw
</p>
<p>" a man working in a kind of Botany Bay of his own ; a number of
</p>
<p>" men were working near him, but left him to work in apart by him-
</p>
<p>" self, solitary and alone, and refused to hold any intercourse with
</p>
<p>" him. My friend was afraid that they belonged to some secret so-
</p>
<p>" ciety, and addressing them said, that he hoped that they were not
</p>
<p>" Ribbonmen, that they refused to let that poor fellow into their
</p>
<p>" company ; but what was their answer? ' Oh ! that fellow refused
</p>
<p>" to become a repealer.' These good men were combined for the
</p>
<p>" cause of repeal; and it is absolutely necessary that you should be
</p>
<p>" doubly active now. I cannot afford to leave out man, woman, or
</p>
<p>" child without becoming repealers. Let every one join with me in

<p>" the call for repeal, and the shout will reverberate to England  the
</p>
<p>" Saxon will be aroused from his slumbers  the echo will be borne on
</p>
<p>" the wild waves, and the Union shall be, must be repealed." This
</p>
<p>is the system by which many men are compelled to join in the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, by treatment such as this. Workmen not associating with a
</p>
<p>fellow-labourer because he committed the crime of refusing to
</p>
<p>become a repealer, because he exercised his judgment upon the
</p>
<p>point  a system under which neither liberty nor independence can
</p>
<p>exist, like every revolution which always ends in establishing a ty-
</p>
<p>ranny of the worst description.
</p>
<p>The next meeting to which I shall advert, took place at the Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation on the 18th of July, Mr. O'Connell, Mr. John O'Connell,
</p>
<p>Mr. Steele, Mr. Barrett, and Dr. Gray were present at it. I believe
</p>
<p>this was one of the earliest periods at which an important branch
</p>
<p>of this conspiracy was brought forward, I mean the establishing of
</p>
<p>the arbitration courts, to which the people were recommended to
</p>
<p>94
</p>
<p>resort in preference lo the petty sessions court. At. that meeting
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell moved the adoption of certain resolutions for the ap-
</p>
<p>pointment of arbitrators,. This is a subject which I shall presently
</p>
<p>advert to, and I will merely say now, that this is the first occasion of
</p>
<p>the assumption of one of the prerogatives of the Crown in endeavour-
</p>
<p>ing to establish courts throughout the country, and to take away the
</p>
<p>administration of justice from the tribunals established by law.
</p>
<p>The next meeting was held at Tuam, on the 24th of July, at
</p>
<p>which Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Steele, and Mr. Barrett were present ;
</p>
<p>there were the usual temperance bands, I believe twenty in num-
</p>
<p>ber, present ; and I believe there were some hundreds of thou-
</p>
<p>sands of people collected on the occasion. A dinner took place
</p>
<p>in the evening of the same day, at which the same traversers
</p>
<p>attended ; Mr. O'Connell spoke at the dinner as follows : " The
</p>
<p>" strength of our enemies is shattered, they are distracted and di-
</p>
<p>" vided in their weakness; and if the people have the grace and the
</p>
<p>" skill to make their adversaries' infirmity the opportunity of their
</p>
<p>" ' own liberty,' the good fight is fought, the goal of freedom is won,
</p>
<p>" and Ireland is again a nation. That Ireland is in the right  that
</p>
<p>" her population is justified in the gigantic efforts which they have
</p>
<p>" latterly been making for the attainment of their legislative inde-
</p>
<p>" pendence  that they have experienced such treatment for a longse-
</p>
<p>" ries of years at the hands of England, as has fully warranted them in
</p>
<p>" the protection of a native senate, are facts which admit of no dispu-
</p>
<p>" tation on the part of rational, dispassionate men, and which are ac-
</p>
<p>" knowledged without qualification by all the nations of the universe.
</p>
<p>" America sent her voice of thunder careering over the illimitable
</p>
<p>" waters of the great Atlantic, to tell you you are justified in all your
</p>
<p>" proceedings. Admiring France looks on with breathless interest,
</p>
<p>" and all Europe has her eye fixed with an intensity of vision on the
</p>
<p>" magnificent demonstration in favour of liberty whereof Ireland is
</p>
<p>" now the theatre. I will be happy if I see my country free. Oh!
</p>
<p>" let us resolve as one man to achieve her freedom, and the day of
</p>
<p>" her glory is assured. Oh ! give a portion of your being to your

</p>
<p>" the death. Pray for her, toil for her incessantly  she is worth your
</p>
<p>*< prayers  she is worth your toil 
</p>
<p>" O Ireland ! shall it e'er be mine
</p>
<p>To wreak thy wrongs in battle line ?
</p>
<p>To raise my victor head and see
</p>
<p>Thy hills, thy dales, thy people free ?
</p>
<p>That glance of bliss is all I crave
</p>
<p>Between my labours and my grave."
</p>
<p>On the 2Gth of July, a meeting of the Association was held, at which
</p>
<p>Mr. 0'Connell,| Mr. John O'Connell, Mr. Ray, Dr. Gray, and Mr.
</p>
<p>Steele attended, and at which Mr. O'Connell alluded to a plan by
</p>
<p>which the estates of the Irish Society, situated in Ulster, were to be
</p>
<p>confiscated.
</p>
<p>I have next, lo call the attention of the Court and the jury to an
</p>
<p>95
</p>
<p>important meeting that took place at. Baltinglass ; but as I cannot
</p>
<p>possibly conclude my statement to night, I wish to suggest to the
</p>
<p>Court whether this may not be a proper time to adjourn, as I do not
</p>
<p>wish to fatigue the jury.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice  We do not wish, Mr. Attorney
</p>
<p>General, to limit you in time ; and if it suits the general conve-
</p>
<p>nience, we do not object to an adjournment.
</p>
<p>The jury were then about to leave the box, when
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice said  Gentlemen, do not leave the
</p>
<p>box at present.
</p>
<p>After a consultation of a few moments,
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice  Mr. Attorney General have you
</p>
<p>thought of what is to be done with the jury between this and to-mor-
</p>
<p>row ?
</p>
<p>The Attorney General.  With respect to that, the matter rests
</p>
<p>entirely with the Court ; I beg to hand up to your Lordships the case
</p>
<p>of The King v. Kirwan and others. Of course, if the Court should
</p>
<p>come to the conclusion that the gentlemen should stay together, it
</p>
<p>will be necessary, as it has occurred in some of the state trials, that
</p>
<p>the Sheriff should have provided a comfortable hotel and accommoda-
</p>
<p>tion suitable to the circumstances. As you have called upon me to
</p>
<p>express my opinion, my Lord, I must, in the discharge of my duty
</p>
<p>say, that I consider nothing can be more desirable in this case than to
</p>
<p>prevent all communication or interference with the jurors ; and to act
</p>
<p>up to the spirit of the Act, my opinion is that they should not be al-
</p>
<p>lowed to separate, as it is no ordinary case, but the very serious
</p>
<p>charge of conspiracy. In a case of high treason, it is stated, upon
</p>
<p>authority, that the Sheriff was directed by the Court to procure suit-
</p>
<p>able accommodation for the jury ; and in a hotel adjoining the
</p>
<p>court apartments were procured, where the jury retired from day to
</p>
<p>day, and received every accommodation and comfort that could be
</p>
<p>procured for them ; but they were not allowed to separate until the
</p>
<p>trial was finished. I state this, my Lord, in the discharge of my pub-
</p>
<p>lic duty, and regret the necessity of inconveniencing the jury, but,

</p>
<p>my Lords, if you should consider it advisable to allow the jury to go
</p>
<p>to their respective homes, I am sure it will be altogether unneces-
</p>
<p>sary to caution gentlemen of their respectability against holding any
</p>
<p>communication with any person whatsoever on the subject of this
</p>
<p>trial; I do not mean with the friends of the traversers alone, but
</p>
<p>with every person.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore  My Lord, now that the Attorney General has in
</p>
<p>part assented to the jurors having liberty to go to their respective
</p>
<p>homes, I beg leave, on the part of the traversers, to say, that they are
</p>
<p>most desirous that the jury should have every convenience and ac-
</p>
<p>commodation, and fully consent to their going home.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  Gentlemen, you may retire to your
</p>
<p>homes, and I trust you will bear in mind, that you are to abstain
</p>
<p>from all communication with any person upon the subject of the pre-
</p>
<p>sent trial.
</p>
<p>96
</p>
<p>WEDNESDAY, January 17th.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General  My Lords, and Gentlemen of the Jury,
</p>
<p>on the 6th of August, there was a meeting at Baltinglass, in the
</p>
<p>county of Wicklow. At that meeting, three of the traversers were
</p>
<p>present, Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Steele, and Dr. Gray. Many thousand
</p>
<p>persons were present ; some of the papers calculated the numhers at
</p>
<p>150,000. Mr. O'Connell addressed that meeting, and among other
</p>
<p>matters, he said : "and shall they tell me that the parliament, which
</p>
<p>" by force and fraud was extorted from us, is never to be revived
</p>
<p>'< again  I deny it. I call on you all to deny it with me, and to give
</p>
<p>" me your universal promise that Ireland shall be a nation. Yes, I
</p>
<p>" call on you to give your universal promise, that Ireland shall be a
</p>
<p>" nation." This was addressed to a multitude of 150,000. He
</p>
<p>afterwards said : " If I want you again, will you not be ready at my
</p>
<p>" word; let any man who is determined to meet me again on a
</p>
<p>" future occasion, when I shall require your presence for a peaceable
</p>
<p>" purpose, hold up his hands." Here the report states, thousands of
</p>
<p>hands were upraised, with loud demonstrations of applause. Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell then said: " Let bog-trotter Fenton take a note of that
</p>
<p>" cheer to his master in London, the Earl of Wicklow, that he may
</p>
<p>" be brought to understand what is the true state of popular feeling
</p>
<p>" in Ireland." Now, again I say it is by no means unimportant, at
</p>
<p>meetings of this kind, to inquire what was the effect produced upon
</p>
<p>those who heard those inflammatory addresses; and I am in a posi-
</p>
<p>tion to prove to you, the observations of some of those assembled
</p>
<p>thousands ; I should say, tens of thousands. One man was heard to
</p>
<p>declare, " We are determined to get repeal, for we are sober now,
</p>
<p>and shall not be put down as we were in '98." Another observed :
</p>
<p>" Let us wait with patience for a few months ; the time is nearer
</p>
<p>than you think ; Ireland was trampled on, but shall be so no longer.''
</p>
<p>Others exclaimed : " that they would turn out to a man and fight for
</p>
<p>repeal." Others : " that they would die, or have repeal, and that
</p>
<p>" other parts of the country would die to a man, but that they were
</p>
<p>" afraid of the sea-side fellows." Another said : " that Father Lawler

</p>
<p>" told them in the chapel, it was too far gone now, and that they
</p>
<p>" would get it, but not without blood being shed." Some were heard
</p>
<p>to say : " that if they were not sure of getting repeal, there would not
</p>
<p>" be a blow of work done in all Ireland, and that the people would
</p>
<p>" rise to a man." Others contradicted that, saying, " that the peo-
</p>
<p>" pie did not intend to rise ; that the only way they wanted to get
</p>
<p>" their right, was by peace ; that if they were refused, foreign powers
</p>
<p>" would strike the blow.'' That is the way the people of this
</p>
<p>country have been deluded by these agitators ; that is what they
</p>
<p>understood by their exhortations to peace. " The time is nearer
</p>
<p>than you think."  That accounts for the manner in which Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell addressed a former meeting: "if I want you again, will
</p>
<p>" you not be ready at my word." That is the meaning of " the
</p>
<p>" time is nearer than you think." The expectation was, that they
</p>
<p>97
</p>
<p>would be required at some future day, of which they should receive
</p>
<p>notice ; when the organization was complete, when the repeal war-
</p>
<p>dens had done their duty, and every parish in Ireland, in the
</p>
<p>language of Mr. Duffy, was ready for liberty. A dinner took
</p>
<p>place on the same day, in Baltinglass, at which Mr. O'Connell,
</p>
<p>Mr. Steele, and Dr. Gray were present. Mr. O'Connell, on that
</p>
<p>occasion said : " Remember, my motto is  whoever commits a crime
</p>
<p>" gives strength to the enemy. That is the doctrine we preach
</p>
<p>u every where, and we will soon have three millions of men who
</p>
<p>" have preached and practised it ; and I tell you, that no statesman
</p>
<p>" ever lived who could resist a population of that kind. But we must
</p>
<p>" persevere. Those meetings I intend to go on with, until such time
</p>
<p>" that no part of Ireland shall not have pronounced, as they say in
</p>
<p>" Spain, or shall have declared their adhesion to our cause. The
</p>
<p>" revolution in Spain was brought about by the military ; but it was
</p>
<p>" bloodless, and the tyrant Espartero has been hurled from'.'power,
</p>
<p>" by the party of the army and the nation. The sergeants, even
</p>
<p>" of the Spanish army, are a fine class of men, and effected that re-
</p>
<p>" volution ; but in the British service, they are the finest, the most
</p>
<p>" intelligent, and the most trust-worthy men that ever existed. In
</p>
<p>" every other service, the sergeants are made officers of, but in the
</p>
<p>" British service they have not' yet learned to do that act of justice;
</p>
<p>" but if our cause goes on, we will do them this piece of service ;
</p>
<p>" that the government will alter their plan, and appoint a great many
</p>
<p>" of the sergeants to commissions, for fear they should pronounce ;
</p>
<p>" and I give them advice to do so from this spot." Now, you un-
</p>
<p>derstand the meaning of the passage " the revolution in Spain was
</p>
<p>brought about by the military." He makes use of that language,
</p>
<p>calculated to inflame the non-commissioned officers in this country
</p>
<p>against the government, to represent to them that they were treated
</p>
<p>with injustice, and to persuade them, that the injustice would be re-
</p>
<p>medied as the cause of repeal advances ; and you will find, when I
</p>
<p>refer to some publications of the traversers connected with the army,
</p>
<p>that the common design of all persons engaged in this conspiracy,

</p>
<p>when they had organized the people of the country, was to endea-
</p>
<p>vour to excite discontent in the army, so as to render the government
</p>
<p>powerless against that organization. He further stated : ' I have
</p>
<p>" thrown out more than once, and I repeat the outline of it now,
</p>
<p>" with the remark, that it is yet far from being complete. What I
</p>
<p>" mean to propose is, that a preservative association shall be formed,
</p>
<p>" which will be preservative of every thing worth preserving, and ob-
</p>
<p>" literative of every thing which ought to be obliterated. That every
</p>
<p>" member of it should find out or produce 100, as a proof of the
</p>
<p>" trust that is reposed in them, in their own neighbourhood, or of
</p>
<p>" their own generosity towards their country. I will take care of
</p>
<p>" the law, and that there shall exist no power of prosecuting or in-
</p>
<p>" dieting any of its members. I trust, that before Christmas comes,
</p>
<p>" we will have that Preservative Society sitting in Dublin, and draw-
</p>
<p>" ing up bills which they will call on the British Parliament to pass,
</p>
<p>" and if they refuse to do so, then they will call respectfully on Her
</p>
<p>o
</p>
<p>98
</p>
<p>M Majesty the Queen, to call her Parliament together in Ireland
</p>
<p>" again." This was the dictation to the hundreds of thousands who
</p>
<p>were assembled at this meeting; first to call on the British Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment to pass bills approved of by the Preservative Society, and if the
</p>
<p>British Parliament did not do so at the dictation of the Preservative
</p>
<p>Society, to call on Her Majesty to summon a Parliament in this
</p>
<p>country, and then, as I said yesterday, to hand over to her the scep-
</p>
<p>tre of this country on terms dictated by those engaged in the conspi-
</p>
<p>racy. Mr. O'Connell then proceeds: " I repeat, the practical details
</p>
<p>" of my plan are not yet worked out, but I wish to announce the
</p>
<p>'' general outline of it, that it may be fomenting in the Irish mind,
</p>
<p>*' and may be digested by others as well as by myself ; and I trust,
</p>
<p>" that before I see another birth-day I shall see Ireland righted, and
</p>
<p>" her Parliament in College-green again." Gentlemen, I think it
</p>
<p>will not be necessary for me now to advert to any thing that inter-
</p>
<p>vened between the 6th and the 12th of August ; and as I stated
</p>
<p>yesterday, I have abstained from commenting much on the general
</p>
<p>state of organization throughout the country, and the object of these
</p>
<p>multitudinous meetings, because their purpose will be more clearly
</p>
<p>pointed out by the language of one of the traversers.
</p>
<p>I shall now beg to call your attention to an important publication in
</p>
<p>the Nation of the 12th of August, six daysafter the meeting at Baltin-
</p>
<p>glass; and I think you will find that publication of importance as throw-
</p>
<p>ing light on theobject of those concerned and engaged inthe conspiracy
</p>
<p>with which they are charged  It is entitled " The March of Nation-
</p>
<p>ality," and is as follows : " How beautiful our country is! How full
</p>
<p>" of cautious energy. How sure a hope lies under her anxiety. How
</p>
<p>" fiercely she springs upon what 'tis right to strike. How temperate-
</p>
<p>" ly she avoids all needless by-battles. And 'tis beautiful, lovely,
</p>
<p>" with that piercing beauty that pains the heart which worships, to
</p>
<p>" see her calming down, and soothing, and repressing her hungry and
</p>
<p>' bruised children, while she prepares for them retribution and re-
</p>
<p>" lief. Her brow is pale  most pale, and well that peaceful mien
</p>
<p>" becomes her. Oh ! 'tis well to see her preparing for the strife

</p>
<p>" without rude boasting or hot noise. It becomes the heiress of suf-
</p>
<p>" fering centuries. It becomes a memory laden with a thousand tran-
</p>
<p>" sient glories and baffled hopes. It were unseemly in her for whom
</p>
<p>" an army of unrevenged martyrs garrison her soil; it were unseem-
</p>
<p>" ly in her whose children feel such pangs and woes ; and most un-
</p>
<p>" wise and unbecoming would it be for her, with so tr}Mng and so
</p>
<p>" vast a contest before her, to wear one rude or reckless look."
</p>
<p>" Let us see what has been done, and what remains.  What were
</p>
<p>" we a year ago ? The squabbling and impotent serfs of England ; here
</p>
<p>" a master mind, and there a heart prophetic with enthusiasm, fore-
</p>
<p>" saw the time when a people, owning all that gives the power to be
</p>
<p>" a nation, would scorn to serve. They foretold that eight millions,
</p>
<p>" with all that enforces independence upon man, with the oldest and
</p>
<p>" most varied history in Europe, with the deepest wrongs, and having
</p>
<p>** their old wronger for their present tyrant  with a home marked
</p>
<p><( apart by the ocean, with limitless misery and limitless resources 
</p>
<p>99
</p>
<p>" were destined to be admirable and strong among the nations of the
</p>
<p>" earth. But now; oh joy and praise!  apathy and distrust have
</p>
<p>" Mod. The storm of nationality has rent the cloudy pall which
</p>
<p>" closed around us: even now it scatters the dark masses, and lends
</p>
<p>" us glimpses of serene liberty.
</p>
<p>" We ask those who still hesitate, to remember what has been
</p>
<p>" done in a year.
</p>
<p>" The Repeal Rent was fifty or a hundred pounds a week  it is
</p>
<p>* now, on an average, fifteen hundred. The enrolled repealers were
</p>
<p>" scarcely a couple of hundred thousand  they are now running
</p>
<p>" towards two millions. It had then half-a-dozen Protestant mem-
</p>
<p>" bers  it has now thousands, from the wealthiest of the gentry to
</p>
<p>" the most stern of the democracy. The entire Catholic hierarchy
</p>
<p>" and priesthood have given it open support or tacit assent. There
</p>
<p>" is no one worth naming in Ireland actively hostile to it. Most of
</p>
<p>" the counties of Leinster and Munster, and some in Ulster and Con-
</p>
<p>" naught, have come in masses together to declare that they are rea-
</p>
<p>" dy to make any sacrifice  money, repose, or life  to achieve their
</p>
<p>" independence.
</p>
<p>" There is nothing recorded in history like this display. The
</p>
<p>" numbers of these meetings were unequalled in any population.
</p>
<p>*' The time, and labour, and loss suffered by the people, in their long
</p>
<p>" marches to them  were never before voluntarily borne, save in the
</p>
<p>" excitement of war. But the order observed in coming and going;
</p>
<p>" the organization necessary to produce such order ; the serious good
</p>
<p>" temper ; the absence of riot or vice ; made each of those meetings
</p>
<p>" a strange and formidable event." Gentlemen, that is not my lan-
</p>
<p>guage, it is the language of one of the accused parties, that the ab-
</p>
<p>sence of riot made each of those meetings strange and formidable. It
</p>
<p>is true that at those meetings Mr. O'Conuell preached peace; it is
</p>
<p>true he wished them to disperse peaceably ; every person must re-
</p>
<p>joice that his injunctions were obeyed  that we have up to this time
</p>
<p>been saved the misery of an attempt by those multitudes, by an out-
</p>
<p>break, to carry out their designs. But the absence of riot, and

</p>
<p>of the commission of actual violence, however we may rejoice at
</p>
<p>it, does not take away from the illegality of those meetings, be-
</p>
<p>cause the intention was to organize the country throughout, that
</p>
<p>they should be peaceable until the organization was complete ;
</p>
<p>the very absence of riot made each of those meetings, in the
</p>
<p>language of Mr. Duffy, a strange and formidable event. It then
</p>
<p>goes on : " There was a time when such meetings might have been
</p>
<p>" plausibly resisted by our despots, and the country forced into a
</p>
<p>" premature contest." They all look to an ultimate contest. " Now
</p>
<p>" there is no such danger. The meetings have been held, and no
</p>
<p>" single event has occurred to furnish the worst minister with an ex-
</p>
<p>" cuse for preventing their repetition.
</p>
<p>" The stopping of them might hazard public peace  not on the
</p>
<p>" instant, for the people knew their policy too well for that : but such
</p>
<p>" oppression might ultimately produce war.
</p>
<p>" The continuance of them has caused no offence  the repetition
</p>
<p>100
</p>
<p>" of them prevents crime, by giving the people hope from a higher
</p>
<p>" source than parish law, and surer justice than revenge. No power
</p>
<p>" dare interfere with those meetings now.
</p>
<p>" If the repeal organization, by general, provincial, and baronial
</p>
<p>" inspectors, by wardens and collectors, by volunteers, members, and
</p>
<p>" associates, have any efficiency in it, it will now have a fair trial. A
</p>
<p>" far inferior machinery, though checked and hampered, carried
</p>
<p>" emancipation. The present organization will be extended to every
</p>
<p>" parish in Ireland, and perfected in every parish. The whole nation
</p>
<p>" will be arrayed under that system. There is a full purpose in the
</p>
<p>" mind of the repeal leaders not to rest until it is carried out. The
</p>
<p>" people will gradually, but surely, be arranged, classed, organized,
</p>
<p>" and bound together. Subordination of ranks, community of thought,
</p>
<p>" obedience to orders from trust to those who command, constant
</p>
<p>" activity in teaching and learning the means of liberation, are ra-
</p>
<p>" pidly becoming general.
</p>
<p>" Nor will the organization stop at arraying the people in their
</p>
<p>" parishes, and massing them all under one will; it will every day
</p>
<p>" extend its operations. It has resources in it to advance as well as
</p>
<p>" to maintain itself. Even now a step lately taken is about to be
</p>
<p>" carried into active operation.
</p>
<p>" Arbitrators will be appointed in every barony. If they should,
</p>
<p>" as we are sure they will, be men of education and pure character,
</p>
<p>" all disputes will be referred to them, and their decisions will be
</p>
<p>" obeyed more exactly than any judge's in the land.
</p>
<p>" Their's will be an honourable and holy office  the unpaid and
</p>
<p>" chosen dispensers of justice. The people will reap an instant be-
</p>
<p>" nefit from this costless, simple, and kindly administration of justice.
</p>
<p>" Patriotism will make their jurisdiction universal, and public opinion
</p>
<p>" will so sanction their decrees that no man will disobey them. But
</p>
<p>" woe to him who disabuses his office by negligence or partiality 
</p>
<p>" woe to him who sullies this popular ermine by partiality  and curses
</p>
<p>" upon the man who, from bigotry, friendship, or vanity, helps to
</p>
<p>" place such a power, for good or ill, in the hands of an uneducated,

<p>" How soon the three hundred trustees of the Irish Fund will
</p>
<p>" come to Dublin we need not anticipate. Suffice it, they will come,
</p>
<p>" and we fancy their advice will pass for law with the people.
</p>
<p>" Ireland is changing into a nation." This Preservative Society
</p>
<p>was to assume the functions of the legislature. They were to
</p>
<p>send bills to the United Parliament, with directions that they should
</p>
<p>receive its sanction, and in the meau time they were to pass as laws
</p>
<p>for the Irish people. Men are not to be returned if they do not do
</p>
<p>their business in such a manner as shall be satisfactory to the Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation. The article then goes on to say : " She is obtaining all the
</p>
<p>" machinery of one  public opinion, order, taxation, justice, legisla-
</p>
<p>" tion. What will be wanting when the work is done, but to call
</p>
<p>" her what she then will be  a nation ?
</p>
<p>" When Grattan walked into the Commons in his Volunteer uni-
</p>
<p>" form, and proposed liberty, he had less power at his back than
</p>
<p>101
</p>
<p>" O'Connell will then have, or indeed has now. He had the armed
</p>
<p>" and clothed, but untrained Volunteers, and he succeeded. He had
</p>
<p>" none of the machinery of a government in his hands, and his thou-
</p>
<p>" sands in bright array had no elements of success but courage and
</p>
<p>" arms.
</p>
<p>" We are better off now  we will before another year be infi-
</p>
<p>" nitely stronger.
</p>
<p>" We have an organization well understood by the people, and ap-
</p>
<p>" plicable to any national exigency : we have an indestructible tie
</p>
<p>" binding the highest and the lowest for a common end ; we have
</p>
<p>" many even of the accessaries of national pomp  our bands, for in-
</p>
<p>" stance ; we have education, temperance, and patient resolve ; we
</p>
<p>" will, when our system is finished, have the form as well as the bulk
</p>
<p>" of a nation  who, then, will dare to question our independence?
</p>
<p>" We need not again refer to the state of our foreign policy. That
</p>
<p>" policy has grown up without the tricks of diplomacy from thesym-
</p>
<p>" pathy felt for our sufferings, our virtues, and our hopes; and it has
</p>
<p>" been confirmed by the obvious interest Europe and America have
</p>
<p>" in the freedom of Ireland. The declaration of disciplined masses
</p>
<p>" in America, that if lawless force were to come upon Ireland their
</p>
<p>" swords would mix in the fray, and the well-understood will of the
</p>
<p>" finest spirits and most potent citizens of France not to let us con-
</p>
<p>" tend alone, are full of warning to England.
</p>
<p>" But their first service is to diminish the likelihood of a contest.
</p>
<p>" He will be a bold minister who believes that the professions of
</p>
<p>" France and America are not an idle boast, and yet draws his sword
</p>
<p>" against Ireland. We have some chance now, notwithstanding the
</p>
<p>" hot words of the fallen Henry Brougham, that we will be allowed
</p>
<p>" to work out our liberties unrestricted. This chance is in part ow-
</p>
<p>" ing to our foreign relations.
</p>
<p>" Nor is England combined against us. Her people groan under
</p>
<p>" the sway that ruins us. The successors of the Norman aristocracy
</p>
<p>" still monopolise their land and harass their industry ; and they be-
</p>
<p>" gin to murmur that they will not legislate nor fight against us.

<p>" But, again we tell Ireland she must free herself by her own might.
</p>
<p>" We have much to do. After all that has been done, we are only
</p>
<p>" at the gate of the temple. Ere we reach the altar we must over-
</p>
<p>" come many a foe and correct many a vice, and we must bear, and
</p>
<p>" battle, and be steadfast.
</p>
<p>" The organization must not only be carried everywhere, but it
</p>
<p>" must be revised everywhere. If the repeal wardens of any district
</p>
<p>" do not see that the organization, division, and training of all the
</p>
<p>" repealers in their district is perfect  if they are not sure that the
</p>
<p>" people are qualified, by simplicity and completeness of organization,
</p>
<p>" by self-denying obedience, by knowledge of all a citizen's duties,
</p>
<p>" by courage and habitual order, to take their place among the men
</p>
<p>" of a free nation ; these wardens have not finished their duty  that
</p>
<p>" district is not ready for liberty.
</p>
<p>" The Protestants must be won. They have no interest different
</p>
<p>" from that of the Catholics. The riches and glory of Ireland would
</p>
<p>102
</p>
<p>" be their's in perhaps a larger proportion. It is sheer folly to sup-
</p>
<p>" pose they can continue to sacrifice interest, patriotism, charity, and
</p>
<p>" happiness, to the wretched dreams of an ascendancy, which Eng-
</p>
<p>" land will as little tolerate as Ireland. Bigotry, or neglect, or fret-
</p>
<p>" fulness, can alone prevent them from accepting the blessings offered
</p>
<p>" them. If treated as they ought to be  if treated as they have a .
</p>
<p>" right to be  they will all take part in the ranks or the councils of
</p>
<p>" the nation.
</p>
<p>" Organized and united we will be free."
</p>
<p>That is the statement of one of the defendants as to the state of
</p>
<p>the country at the time, of the effect of the organization, and of the
</p>
<p>object of the parties engaged in planning it and carrying it out.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I shall now call your attention to the two meet-
</p>
<p>ings, which were held a few days after the 15th of August, one at
</p>
<p>Clontibret, in the County of Monaghan, at which the Rev. Mr. Tier-
</p>
<p>ney was present ; the other at Tara, the most remarkable of all these
</p>
<p>monster meetings. There were present at that meeting, Mr. O'Connell,
</p>
<p>Mr. J. O'Connell, Rev. Mr. Tyrrell, Mr. Barrett, Mr. Steele, and Dr.
</p>
<p>Gray. The locality of Tara was well known, and was selected as the
</p>
<p>place of meeting for two purposes. First, because it was the place
</p>
<p>where the ancient monarchs of Ireland were elected, and secondly,
</p>
<p>because it was the scene of a battle which took place in 1798,
</p>
<p>in which those engaged in the rebellion were defeated. Vast
</p>
<p>numbers of people assembled there ; at the highest calculation there
</p>
<p>were one million of persons, at the lowest 100,000 present; how-
</p>
<p>ever, whatever the number was, it was a formidable meeting.
</p>
<p>This spot of ground was selected for the reasons I have men-
</p>
<p>tioned, in order to exasperate the people with the recollection
</p>
<p>of its having been the scene of the defeat of those engaged in the
</p>
<p>rebellion of 1798. Hundreds of persons were actually seen on
</p>
<p>their knees plucking the wild plants growing on the ground, where
</p>
<p>the remains of the persons who fell there were buried, and pulling
</p>
<p>a red plant which grows there, under the impression that the colour
</p>
<p>of the leaf arose in consequence of the slaughter which had taken

</p>
<p>place. This particular scene was selected to exasperate the peo-
</p>
<p>ple, by endeavouring to recall events that had taken place years
</p>
<p>before. At that meeting, Mr. O'Connell addressed the people
</p>
<p>in these terms : " Yes, the overwhelming majesty of your multitude
</p>
<p>" will be taken to England, and will have its effect there. The Duke
</p>
<p>" of Wellington began by threatening us. He talked of civil war,
</p>
<p>" but he does not say a single word of that now. He i3 now getting
</p>
<p>" eyelet-holes made in the old barracks ; and only think of an old
</p>
<p>" general doing such a thing, just as if we were going to break our
</p>
<p>" heads against stone walls. I am glad to find that a great quantity of
</p>
<p>" brandy and biscuit has been lately imported, and I hope the poor
</p>
<p>" soldiers got some of them. But the Duke of Wellington is now
</p>
<p>" talking of attacking us, and I am glad of it ; but I tell him this,
</p>
<p>" I mean no disrespect to the brave, the gallant, and the good-cou-
</p>
<p>" ducted soldiers that compose the Queen's army, and all of them
</p>
<p>" we have in this country are exceedingly well conducted. There
</p>
<p>103
</p>
<p>" is not one of you that has a single complaint to make against any
</p>
<p>" of them. They are the bravest army in the world, and therefore
</p>
<p>" I do not mean to disparage them at all ; hut I feel it to be a fact
</p>
<p>" that Ireland, roused as she is at the present moment, would, if
</p>
<p>" they made war upon us, furnish women enough to beat the entire
</p>
<p>" of the Queen's forces. At the last fight for Ireland, when she was
</p>
<p>" betrayed by having confided in England's honour ; but, oh ! Eng-
</p>
<p>u lish honour will never again betray our land, for the man would
</p>
<p>" deserve to be betrayed who would again confide in England. I
</p>
<p>" would as soon think of confiding in the cousin-german of a certain
</p>
<p>" personage having two horns and a hoof. At that last battle the
</p>
<p>" Irish soldiers, after three days' fighting, being attacked by fresh
</p>
<p>" troops, faltered and gave way, and one thousand five hundred of
</p>
<p>" the British army entered the breach. The Irish soldiers were
</p>
<p>" fainting and retiring, when the women of Limerick threw them-
</p>
<p>" selves between the contending forces, and actually stayed the pro-
</p>
<p>" gress of the advancing enemy. See how we have accumulated the
</p>
<p>" people of Ireland for this Repeal year. When on the 2nd of
</p>
<p>" January, I ventured to call it the Repeal year every person laughed
</p>
<p>" at me. Are they laughing now ? It is our turn to laugh at
</p>
<p>" present. Before twelve months more the parliament will be in
</p>
<p>" College-green. I said the Union did not take away from the
</p>
<p>" people their legal rights. I told you that the Union did not de-
</p>
<p>" prive the people of that right, or take away the authority to have
</p>
<p>" self-legislation. It has not lessened the prerogatives of the Crown,
</p>
<p>" or taken away the rights of the Sovereign, and amongst them is
</p>
<p>" the right to call her parliament whenever the people are entitled
</p>
<p>" to have it in Ireland : And the Queen has only to-morrow to
</p>
<p>" issue her writs and get the Chancellor to seal them, and if Sir
</p>
<p>" Edward Sugden does not sign them she will soon get an Irishman
</p>
<p>" that will, to revive the Irish parliament. The towns which sold
</p>
<p>" their birthrights have no right to be reckoned amongst the towns
</p>
<p>" sending members to parliament. King James the First in one
</p>
<p>" day created forty boroughs in Ireland, and the Queen has the

</p>
<p>" same right as her predecessor to do so. We have a list of the
</p>
<p>" towns to return members ; the counties, as a matter of course, will
</p>
<p>" return them according to their population ; and the Queen has
</p>
<p>" only to order writs to issue and to have honest members to advise
</p>
<p>" her to issue those writs, and the Irish parliament is revived by
</p>
<p>" its own energy and the force of the Sovereign's prerogative.
</p>
<p>" I want only the Queen to exercise her prerogative, and the Irish
</p>
<p>" people will obtain their nationality again. If, at the present mo-
</p>
<p>" ment the Irish parliament was in existence, even as it was in
</p>
<p>" 1800  is there a coward amongst you  is there a wretch amongst
</p>
<p>" you so despicable, that would not die rather than allow the Union
</p>
<p>" to pass ? Let every man who if we had an Irish parliament,
</p>
<p>" would rather die than allow the Union to pass, lift up his hands.
</p>
<p>" Yes, the Queen will call that parliament. You may say, it is the
</p>
<p>" act of her ministry, if you please. To be sure it would be the act
</p>
<p>" of her ministry, and the people of Ireland are entitled to have
</p>
<p>104
</p>
<p>" their friends appointed to the ministry. The Irish parliament will
</p>
<p>" then assemble, and I defy all the generals, old and young, and all
</p>
<p>" the old women in pantaloons  nay, I defy all the cavalry of the
</p>
<p>" earth to take away the parliament from Ireland again." Give me
</p>
<p>" three millions of Repealers, and I will soon have them ; the first
</p>
<p>" step is being taken ; and I announce to you from this spot, that
</p>
<p>" all the magistrates that have been deprived of the commission of
</p>
<p>" the peace shall be appointed by the association to settle all the
</p>
<p>" disputes and differences in their neighbourhood. Keep out of the
</p>
<p>" Petty Sessions' Court, and go to them. On Monday next we will
</p>
<p>*' submit a plan to choose persons to be arbitrators to settle the
</p>
<p>" differences of the people without expense ; and I call upon every
</p>
<p>'' man who wishes to be thought the friend of Ireland to have his
</p>
<p>" disputes settled by the arbitrators, and not again to go to the
</p>
<p>" Petty Sessions. We shall shortly have the Preservative Society
</p>
<p>" to arrange the means of procuring from her Majesty the exercise
</p>
<p>" of her prerogative ; and I believe I am able to announce to you
</p>
<p>" that twelve months cannot possibly elapse without having an hurra
</p>
<p>" for our parliament in College-green. Remember, I pronounce
</p>
<p>" the Union to be null  to be obeyed as an injustice must be
</p>
<p>" obeyed, when it is supported by law, until we have the royal
</p>
<p>" authority to set the matter right and substitute our own parliament."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you will observe the statement made by Mr. O'Connell that
</p>
<p>the magistrates who had been deprived of the commission of the peace
</p>
<p>were to be appointed by the Repeal Association, as judges of the Arbi-
</p>
<p>tration courts. But I tell you this, and I say it with confidence, for I
</p>
<p>heard one of the learned Judges on the bench, who charged the Grand
</p>
<p>Jury say it, that if such courts were beneficial for the public, they
</p>
<p>should be appointed by Act of Parliament, and that these courts are
</p>
<p>illegal and an attempt to exercise the prerogative of the Crown
</p>
<p>They issued summonses calling on them to appear and to consent
</p>
<p>to submit their disputes to the arbitration of the persons so ap-
</p>
<p>pointed, but that device and contrivance will not prevent their
</p>
<p>appointment of these arbitrators from being an usurpation of the

</p>
<p>prerogative of the Crown. It is remarkable, that this measure was
</p>
<p>adopted in consequence of the exercise of the right of the Crown,
</p>
<p>to dismiss the magistrates, who thought fit to attend those multi-
</p>
<p>tudinous meetings, which I have described to you, not in my own
</p>
<p>language, but in that of one of the traversers as formidable events.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, there was a dinner at Tara on the same day. At
</p>
<p>that dinner, Dr. Gray addressed the assembly, and said : " In one
</p>
<p>" thing only was he compelled to differ from the observations that
</p>
<p>" had fallen from their respected chairman. In giving the toast, he
</p>
<p>'' stated that the press was of no politics, and he wished to correct
</p>
<p>" the error, by declaring on behalf of the national press of Ireland,
</p>
<p>" that the members of it were politicians in the strongest sense of
</p>
<p>" the word. He had himself the honour of being among them that
</p>
<p>" evening as a guest ; but he felt that wherever he was, he was an
</p>
<p>" Irishman, and as an Irishman he was ready to strike out boldly for
</p>
<p>" the political liberty of his country. The repeal press was a politi-
</p>
<p>105
</p>
<p>" cal press, but its politics were the politics of Ireland; and steadily
</p>
<p>" adhering to the course it had adopted, it would never deviate to
</p>
<p>' 4 the right hand or to the left, until the people of that country were
</p>
<p>" relieved from Saxon tyranny and oligarchic domination. I be-
</p>
<p>11 lieve I best evince the high sense I entertain of the compliment
</p>
<p>" paid the press gang by being brief, and allowing them to gang
</p>
<p>" home, that they may send their broad sheets through the length
</p>
<p>" and breadth of the land, and not only of this land, but to the
</p>
<p>" alien isle hard by that so jealously watches the proceedings of
</p>
<p>" this day. Every eye is fixed upon the council assembled this
</p>
<p>" day at Tara, and eagerly looks to its resolves. Is it not a na-
</p>
<p>" tional council in the most extended meaning of the phrase?
</p>
<p>" Have not we at our head the monarch of the Irish heart ; have
</p>
<p>" we not the spiritual peers of the realm ; do not the lay peers aid
</p>
<p>" by their counsel ? We have here, too, the clergy of the land,
</p>
<p>" and the constitutional representatives of the people ; aye, and the
</p>
<p>'' people themselves in their multitudinous thousands have this day
</p>
<p>" assembled within the precincts of the ancient council-hall of Tara,
</p>
<p>" taken counsel together and issued their proclamation, and that pro-
</p>
<p>" clamation is no compromise. As I this day strayed over the
</p>
<p>" ruins of past glory, I chanced to walk over the graves of the
</p>
<p>" patriots of what I may call our own day. I cannot find words
</p>
<p>" to give expression to the emotions I felt as I contemplated
</p>
<p>" their sad fate. A mournful chill came upon me, when I looked
</p>
<p>" upon their resting-place, and saw in their end the dark his-
</p>
<p>" tory of the past ; but that chill passed away, and hope revived,
</p>
<p>" when I saw that upon their graves the stone of destiny stood
</p>
<p>" erect. For centuries has that mysterious relic lain prostrate as the
</p>
<p>" land whose destiny its fall symbolized ; but now I saw it erect
</p>
<p>" again, and on Tara's hill, and over the patriots' grave. I felt that
</p>
<p>" the blood of the last martyr had been shed, and that Ireland her-
</p>
<p>" self would soon assume the upright position, and exhibit the dignity
</p>
<p>" of a nation." On that occasion, Mr. O'Connell said : " But he is no
</p>
<p>" statesman that does not recollect the might that slumbers in a pea-

<p>" sant's arm, and when you multiply that might by vulgar arithmetic,
</p>
<p>" to the extent of six hundred or seven hundred thousand, is the
</p>
<p>" man a statesman or driveller who expects that might will always
</p>
<p>" slumber amidst grievances, continued oppression endured too long,
</p>
<p>" and the determination to allow them to cure themselves, and take
</p>
<p>" active measures to prevent the outbreak, which sooner or later will
</p>
<p>" be the consequence of the present afflicted state of Ireland? I say
</p>
<p>" sooner or later, because I venture to assert, while I live myself,
</p>
<p>" that outbreak will not take place. But sooner or later, if they do
</p>
<p>" not correct the evil, and restore to Ireland her power of self-
</p>
<p>" government, the day will come when they will rue their present
</p>
<p>" want of policy, and will weep, perhaps in tears of blood, for their
</p>
<p>" want of consideration and unkindness to a country, whose people
</p>
<p>" could reward them amply by the devotion of those hearts and the
</p>
<p>" vigour of those arms. I now turn to the gentry of Ireland ; let
</p>
<p>" them first answer the question that I have already put to them. Is
</p>
<p>p
</p>
<p>106
</p>
<p>" it possible things can remain as they are ? I defy them to produce
</p>
<p>" from the congregated millions of Irishmen, a single man who will
</p>
<p>" answer that question in the affirmative. It is impossible they should
</p>
<p>" remain as they are. Why then do they not join us ? Is it not
</p>
<p>" their interest to join us? What are they afraid of? It cannot be
</p>
<p>" of the people, for they are under the strictest discipline. I am
</p>
<p>" even one of them myself, and no general ever had an army more
</p>
<p>" submissive to his command than the people of Ireland are to the
</p>
<p>" wishes of a single individual." I think, that very submission to a
</p>
<p>single individual, a very formidable circumstance, because, if he is
</p>
<p>able to direct those congregated thousands not to engage in riot or dis-
</p>
<p>turbance, the same person will have power, when the time has arrived,
</p>
<p>to give directions of a different nature, which will be equally obeyed.
</p>
<p>This is evident from thejquestion put by Mr. O'Connell, when he said:
</p>
<p>" when I want you again will you come," and the answer was, "Yes, the
</p>
<p>sooner the better." We know the meaning of that: "we may
</p>
<p>keep the peace at present, because it is not safe to do otherwise."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, although we must all rejoice at Mr. O'Connell's anxiety
</p>
<p>that there should be no riot, and no disturbance, still, in the language
</p>
<p>of Mr. Duffy, those meetings were strange and formidable events.
</p>
<p>On the 20th of August, a meeting was held at Roscommon, and Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell, Mr. Steele, and Mr. Barrett were there. Mr. O'Connell,
</p>
<p>in addressing the meeting, said amongst other things : " The people
</p>
<p>" of Ireland are too great to submit ! Drink may elevate the courage
</p>
<p>" of men going into battle, but they go at last to the battle with a
</p>
<p>" heavy heart. If I had to go to the battle, I would have men who
</p>
<p>" would not spend their fire or strength, but who would stand
</p>
<p>" or move in a slow step. Give me the band of teetotallers,
</p>
<p>" with their wives and daughters, in the run, and no army in the
</p>
<p>" world would molest them. The people are more sober ; they are
</p>
<p>" not now what they were in 1798, and on that account I look for-
</p>
<p>" ward to the success of the struggle now going on." You will
</p>
<p>recollect, the statement of some one in the crowd at Baltinglass, that
</p>
<p>they were sober then, not as in 1798, and on that account they

</p>
<p>looked forward to success in the struggle which was now going on.
</p>
<p>At the dinner given on that occasion, Mr. O'Connell said : " I am
</p>
<p>" really inclined to think, that of all the demonstrations which have
</p>
<p>" been made, the meeting of this day ought to strike our enemies
</p>
<p>" with the greatest terror, and give our friends the greatest confi-
</p>
<p>" dence." That was the opinion of Mr. O'Connell himself, that
</p>
<p>those meetings were calculated to strike terror into the minds of those
</p>
<p>who were favourable to the British constitution, not perhaps from an
</p>
<p>apprehension that they would end in an immediate outbreak, but
</p>
<p>from the consequences which would result from these demonstrations
</p>
<p>of physical force.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, there was a meeting of the Association on the 22nd
</p>
<p>of August, at which Mr. O'Connell, Mr. John O'Connell, Mr. Ray,
</p>
<p>Mr. Steele, and Dr. Gray, were present. I am not sure whether
</p>
<p>any of the other traversers were present. On that occasion, Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell submitted to their consideration a plan for the renewed
</p>
<p>lor
</p>
<p>action of the Irish Parliament. I shall not trouble you with read-
</p>
<p>ing the entire account, I shall merely refer you to the third re-
</p>
<p>solution, which is in ihese words : " The people of Ireland do
</p>
<p>" firmly insist upon the restoration of the Irish House of Commons,
</p>
<p>" consisting of three hundred representatives of the Irish people,
</p>
<p>" and claim in the presence of their Creator, the right of the people
</p>
<p>" of Ireland to such restoration. They have submitted to the Union
</p>
<p>" as being binding as a law, but they declare solemnly that it is not
</p>
<p>" founded on right, or on constitutional principles, and that it is not
</p>
<p>" obligatory upon conscience. They agree with the Tory Attorney
</p>
<p>" General Saurin, that the only binding power of the Union is
</p>
<p>" the strength of the English domination. They also agree with
</p>
<p>" him that resistance to the Union is in the abstract a duty, and the
</p>
<p>" exhibition of that resistance, a mere question of prudence. They
</p>
<p>" will therefore resist the Union, by all legal, peaceful, and consti-
</p>
<p>" tutional means." If binding in law, I do not understand the con-
</p>
<p>sistency of saying that the Crown had a prerogative to issue writs
</p>
<p>for summoning an Irish Parliament. You are in possession of what
</p>
<p>this committee mean by legal and constitutional means. The plan
</p>
<p>then proceeds to declare the number of representatives to be re-
</p>
<p>turned, and a schedule was annexed showing the number and the
</p>
<p>population of the different counties and towns. It then provides
</p>
<p>that the right of voting should be household suffrage, and vote by
</p>
<p>ballot, and declared that the monarch de facto of England, should at
</p>
<p>all times be monarch de jure of Ireland. Then, after providing that
</p>
<p>the connexion between Great Britain and Ireland should be per-
</p>
<p>petuated by the Crown, it concludes by stating this was to be carried
</p>
<p>into effect, according to recognised constitutional principles ; that is,
</p>
<p>by the Crown dispensing with the provisions of an Act of Parliament,
</p>
<p>and directing the issuing of writs, under the great seal, for the as-
</p>
<p>sembling of an Irish Parliament, a prerogative which has not been
</p>
<p>claimed for a long period of our history. Gentlemen, it is not be-
</p>
<p>cause it was stated by the parties, that all this could be done by
</p>
<p>constitutional means, that we are to assume that it is so. I tell you,

</p>
<p>subject to the correction of the Court, that the Crown does not pos-
</p>
<p>sess the power of dispensing with the Act of Union, and issuing writs
</p>
<p>to summon an Irish Parliament.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, on the 23rd of August, a meeting took place at the
</p>
<p>Association, at which Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Barrett, Mr. Ray, Mr.
</p>
<p>Steele, Mr. John O'Connell, and Dr. Gray were present. You
</p>
<p>will recollect the language I read from the Nation of the 12th
</p>
<p>of August, that Ireland was changing into a nation, that she had
</p>
<p>obtained all the machinery, public opinion, order, faxation, jus-
</p>
<p>tice, and legislation : justice and legislation referring to the arbi-
</p>
<p>tration courts. I shall now call your attention to an address
</p>
<p>made by Dr. Gray' to the Association on that occasion, submitting
</p>
<p>a plan for the institution of those courts throughout the country,
</p>
<p>because the Crown, in exercise of its prerogative, had thought
</p>
<p>fit to deprive the magistrates, who had attended those multitu-
</p>
<p>dinous meetings, of the commission of the peace. In that address,
</p>
<p>108
</p>
<p>Dr. Gray, after stating the manner in which the committee proposed
</p>
<p>the arbitrators should be elected, said, that after the election, and
</p>
<p>before the arbitrators acted in their new capacity, they were to re-
</p>
<p>ceive the sanction of the Association. I shall not trouble you, Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, by reading the report at this stage of the proceedings. It
</p>
<p>will be offered in evidence to you, but it is perfectly clear that the
</p>
<p>course adopted was this, that the Association was to sanction the
</p>
<p>appointment of these persons who were to be elected by the people
</p>
<p>as judges, at the arbitration court, thereby assuming the prerogative
</p>
<p>of the Crown, which alone had the right of appointing judges in
</p>
<p>Courts of Justice, and of regulating the administration of justice
</p>
<p>throughout the country. I state confidently to you that it is an offence
</p>
<p>against the law for any person or any number of persons to assume
</p>
<p>the administration of justice, in the manner in which it has been
</p>
<p>assumed by this Association.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I shall now call your attention to a publication in
</p>
<p>the " Nation," of the 26th of August. This paper is a portion
</p>
<p>of the Repeal press, which I have already stated was a most power-
</p>
<p>ful organ in the hands of Mr. O'Connell, in carrying out his ob-
</p>
<p>ject. The article I allude to is headed : " The crisis is upon
</p>
<p>us," and goes on to say : " Our Union with England was not merely
</p>
<p>" an unjust and iniquitous, but an illegal and invalid Act. The natural
</p>
<p>" rights of the people were trampled down in utter disregard of the
</p>
<p>" forms and spirit of the constitution. The stateman's wisdom, and
</p>
<p>" the lawyer's learning, lent authority to the instinctive repudiation
</p>
<p>" of the patriot. Saurin, amongst others, declared that resistance was
</p>
<p>" a question of time and prudence, and would become a duty
</p>
<p>" whenever strength and opportunity might concur in justifying
</p>
<p>" the effort for its abrogation. A greater than Saurin has at
</p>
<p>" length given forth the irrevocable voice ; resistance to the Union
</p>
<p>" has become a duty." I adverted yesterday to the observations
</p>
<p>made by Mr. Saurin, before the Act of Union had passed, in his
</p>
<p>place, in the Irish House of Commons. There is no parallel be-
</p>
<p>tween statements made when opposing a measure before becoming

</p>
<p>a law, and observations made when it had become the law of the land.
</p>
<p>If a man believes that a particular measure in contemplation of the
</p>
<p>legislature, would be injurious to the best interests of this country,
</p>
<p>he is justified in stating his objections to such a measure. Scarcely
</p>
<p>an Act has passed on which many observations have not been made,
</p>
<p>which, if critically examined, would be found to go farther than the
</p>
<p>speaker in his cooler moments would have gone ; but that does not
</p>
<p>justify the adoption of such language after the measure has become
</p>
<p>the law of the land. Mr. Saurin was the last man alive, who, when a
</p>
<p>measure had become the law of the land, would have said, that re-
</p>
<p>sistance to the law was a duty. Yet the authority of that eminent
</p>
<p>man is made use of in this article, for the purpose of conveying to
</p>
<p>the misguided people that such was his opinion ; he never declared
</p>
<p>any such opinion, because, after it became the law of the land, he
</p>
<p>never made use of an expression which would recommend such a
</p>
<p>109
</p>
<p>course. Yet. Mr. Duffy thinks fit to circulate through the length and
</p>
<p>breadth of the land, that a greater than Saurin has said that resist-
</p>
<p>ance to the Act of Union has become a duty. He then goes on to
</p>
<p>say : " This, the forty-third year of provincial degradation, may, if
</p>
<p>" the people have worth and energy, become the first of restored in-
</p>
<p>" dependence. The knot, which had baffled every attempt to unra-
</p>
<p>" vel its complications, has been severed with one final decisive blow,
</p>
<p>" struck with the sword of peace consecrated on the height of Tara.
</p>
<p>" There is away, if there exists a will, for the liberation of Ireland 
</p>
<p>"for the reconstruction of her legislature. The case between the
</p>
<p>" people and her leaders stand thus : In a season of apparent apa-
</p>
<p>" thy to the high and holy impulses of nationality  when cicatriza-
</p>
<p>" tion seemed superinduced by Whig palliatives, and the wound in-
</p>
<p>" flicted on our Irish pride and honour no longer gaped and bled 
</p>
<p>" O'Connell tore asunder the bandages and revealed to Ireland the
</p>
<p>" exact seat and true character of her social and political disease. He
</p>
<p>" cast to the winds the soothing system, and aroused his countrymen
</p>
<p>" from the delirious repose produced by dependence on the sym-
</p>
<p>" pathies of foreign faction. The memories of the past, blending
</p>
<p>" glorious traditions of remote days with recollections of modern
</p>
<p>" '82 were appealed to ; the necessities of the present time were
</p>
<p>" bared to view in their appalling reality ; the hopes of the fu-
</p>
<p>" ture were invoked, until, by every varied argument addressed to
</p>
<p>" their judgment and their feelings  their own firesides  the tombs
</p>
<p>" of their fathers  the cradles of their children  he so wrought upon
</p>
<p>" the millions that they answered his invitation to come forth from
</p>
<p>" bondage with the unanimity of one man. It seemed as if the time
</p>
<p>" had come to evoke the slumbering might of that Irish army which
</p>
<p>" the legend tells us was doomed to sleep entranced in panoplied ar-
</p>
<p>" ray until aroused by some potent spell for the expulsion of foreign
</p>
<p>" tyrants. So sudden, so enthusiastic, so resistless was the response
</p>
<p>" of the Irish mind to the call of the Irish leader ! Meeting was held
</p>
<p>" after meeting, each exceeding its predecessor in numbers, and all
</p>
<p>" without exception challenging respect for the demeanour of the

</p>
<p>" masses who attended. Evidence was piled on evidence of a na-
</p>
<p>" tional will, combined with a national morality and intelligence, uni-
</p>
<p>" versal throughout every county in Ireland. The million shout of
</p>
<p>" Tara completed the proof, and flung back the responsibility again
</p>
<p>" upon the leaders ! Yes  the people had sufficiently shown their
</p>
<p>" willingness and worthiness 1o be led by a thousand proofs of de-
</p>
<p>" votion to the cause and of fidelity to their leaders. Whither and
</p>
<p>" when ? began to be asked, ere the echoes of Tara had died upon
</p>
<p>" the public ear. The leaders have answered, and the responsibility
</p>
<p>" is again upon the people. The rubicon has been crossed by the
</p>
<p>" promulgation of a plan for the reconstruction of an Irish legislature.
</p>
<p>" For weal or for woe  for ages of bondage or centuries of inde-
</p>
<p>" pendence  we stand committed. Forward and prompt action is
</p>
<p>" sure of its reward in speedy and glorious triumph  the criminal
</p>
<p>" abandonment of opportunity is equally certain to be avenged in the
</p>
<p>" perpetuation of misrule. In the making or marring of our own for-
</p>
<p>110
</p>
<p>" tunes, we involve to an incalculable extent the hopes of the whole
</p>
<p>" human family. We have gloried in the irresistible efficacy of a new
</p>
<p>" element in political warfare which we boast to have invented, and
</p>
<p>" by whose employment we have already won many outposts. Will
</p>
<p>" the principle or the men fail now in this last decisive struggle ?
</p>
<p>" Shall the nations who have given us their admiration, and sympa-
</p>
<p>" thy, and trust, mock at us for braggarts? our children's children
</p>
<p>" curse our memories as they spit on our dishonoured clay? The
</p>
<p>" world looks on our country for an example. Ireland must become
</p>
<p>" a nation now, or continue a province for ever. We purposely post-
</p>
<p>" pone critical details of the plan submitted under the sanction of
</p>
<p>" O'Connell's name, and with the authority of the Association 
</p>
<p>" contenting ourselves to admire, and inviting our countrymen to ad-
</p>
<p>" mire with us, the symmetry of the temple of freedom raised for
</p>
<p>" their reception. The portals stand open  the genius of '82 has
</p>
<p>" consecrated the edifice  there may be a bench removed with ad-
</p>
<p>" vantage, or an alteration of internal arrangement with convenience ;
</p>
<p>" but the exigence of the hour is to secure the possession, and ap-
</p>
<p>" propriate the structure to the sacred uses of self-legislation. The
</p>
<p>" number of representatives who will occupy seats in the future Irish
</p>
<p>" House of Commons happens to coincide with that determined upon
</p>
<p>" as the most eligible limit for the intended Preservative Society. It
</p>
<p>" is desirable for many reasons that the distribution of representation
</p>
<p>" should be the same, so that the transition may be easy and natural
</p>
<p>"to the recognized and technically legal condition of a Parliament.
</p>
<p>" The chosen trustees of the people's money now will have the first
</p>
<p>" claim upon their votes hereafter. Much inconvenience will bepre-
</p>
<p>" vented by limiting the number strictly according to the schedule
</p>
<p>" submitted to the nation in the plan of the Association. Constitu-
</p>
<p>" encies  as they will be  districts as they are  having greater en-
</p>
<p>" thusiasm in the cause, or enabled to contribute more liberally to
</p>
<p>" the qualifying fund than others, can transfer to the less fortunate
</p>
<p>" localities their surplus of ability and pecuniary weight with advan-
</p>
<p>" tage and honour to both parties."

</p>
<p>On the 4th of September, a meeting was held at the Association,
</p>
<p>at which were present Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Steele, Mr. John O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell, and Dr. Gray. At that meeting, subscriptions were handed in
</p>
<p>from various parts of America. Mr. O'Connell read a letter from
</p>
<p>the parties who sent them, and then proceeded to state, that a meet-
</p>
<p>ing would take place at Clontarf, on the 8th of October, and that the
</p>
<p>chair would be taken on the mound that covers the bodies of the
</p>
<p>Danes. He then alluded to the prospect of the success of the repeal
</p>
<p>question, and that the speech from the Throne, instead of throwing
</p>
<p>a damper on the ardour of the Irish people, as it was intended to do,
</p>
<p>was calculated to produce a contrary effect. Prior to that meeting
</p>
<p>of the 4th of September, there was a meeting which I intend to call
</p>
<p>your attention to, that was a meeting held on the 28th of August ;
</p>
<p>Hut before I do so, I would wish to recall to your recollection, that
</p>
<p>o;i the prorogation of Parliament, Her Majesty made a speech from
</p>
<p>the throne, which had reference, among other matters, to the existing
</p>
<p>Ill
</p>
<p>state of Ireland, and it was in reference to that speech that the ob-
</p>
<p>servations were made by Mr. O'Connell. Her Majesty said: "I
</p>
<p>" have observed with the deepest concern, the persevering efforts
</p>
<p>" which are made to stir up discontent and disaffection among my
</p>
<p>" subjects in Ireland, and to excite them to demand a repeal of the
</p>
<p>" legislative Union. It has been, and ever will be, my earnest desire
</p>
<p>" to administer the government of that country in a spirit of strict
</p>
<p>"justice and impartiality; and to co-operate with Parliament in ef-
</p>
<p>" fecting such amendments in the existing laws, as may tend to im-
</p>
<p>" prove the social condition, and to develope the natural resources of
</p>
<p>" Ireland. From a deep conviction that the Legislative Union is not
</p>
<p>" less essential to the attainment of these objects, than to the
</p>
<p>" strength and stability of the Empire ; it is my firm determination,
</p>
<p>" with your support, and under the blessing of Divine Providence,
</p>
<p>" to maintain inviolate that great bond of connexion] between the
</p>
<p>" two countries, lhave forborne from requiring any additional pow-
</p>
<p>" ers for the counteraction of designs hostile to the concord and wel-
</p>
<p>" fare of my dominions, as well from my unwillingness to distrust the
</p>
<p>" efficacy of the ordinary law, as from my reliance on the good sense
</p>
<p>" and patriotism of my people, and on the solemn declaration of Par-
</p>
<p>" liament in support of the legislative Union. I feel assured that
</p>
<p>"those of my faithful subjects who have influence and authority in
</p>
<p>" Ireland, will discourage to the utmost of their power a system of
</p>
<p>" pernicious agitation, which disturbs the industry and retards the
</p>
<p>" improvement of that country, and excites feelings of mutual dis-
</p>
<p>" trust and animosity between different classes of my people. On
</p>
<p>the 26th of August, that speech was delivered from the throne. A
</p>
<p>meeting was held at the Association on the 28th. Her Majesty's
</p>
<p>speech had then arrived in Dublin. At that meeting there were pre-
</p>
<p>sent, Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Steele, Mr. John O'Connell, Mr. Ray, Mr.
</p>
<p>Barrett. It was stated that the arbitration forms were ready, and
</p>
<p>the meeting was then adjourned to the following day, the 29th of
</p>
<p>August. On that day, the same parties who had attended on the
</p>
<p>former day were present, except Mr. Barrett. Mr. O'Connell gave

</p>
<p>notice of that, which I shall call your particular attention to just
</p>
<p>now. It was a counter manifesto which was to be addressed to the
</p>
<p>subjects of the Crown throughout Ireland. At that meeting Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell addressed the meeting as follows: "My next topic, I
</p>
<p>" mean to move that it be referred to a committee to prepare the
</p>
<p>" draft of an address to be laid before the Association, directed to
</p>
<p>" our fellow-subjects in every part of the universe, those who are
</p>
<p>" obedient to the British throne, stating the grievances under which
</p>
<p>" the people of Ireland suffer, and the course which they deem it
</p>
<p>" prudent to adopt. The committee will enter into the details of
</p>
<p><c all those matters, which, in my judgment, justify, and not only jus-
</p>
<p>" tify, but demand the continuance of the present agitation. We
</p>
<p>" have been accused of being discontented, and we plead guilty to
</p>
<p>" the charge, if guilty it can be called. Yes, Ireland is deeply dis-
</p>
<p>" contented, and it would be an accusation of great weight, and a
</p>
<p>" crime of considerable turpitude, if Ireland was discontented with-
</p>
<p>112
</p>
<p>" out an adequate reason. It is my business to show it to the pub-
</p>
<p>" lie and to the universe, for foreign nations have their eyes upon us,
</p>
<p>" as well as the inhabitants of these realms. It is my business to
</p>
<p>" vindicate the faithful people of Ireland from any guilt in the dis-
</p>
<p>" content that universally prevails, but which manifests itself in so
</p>
<p>" peaceable and constitutional a manner. We are accused of being
</p>
<p>" disaffected. I deny and spurn the accusation, and mark it with this
</p>
<p>" epithet, it is as false as hell. We are not disaffected, we make the
</p>
<p>" constitutional distinction between the Sovereign on the throne, and
</p>
<p>" the minister whose act it is  the Sovereign whose name is used,
</p>
<p>" the minister whose responsibility is constitutionally offered, though
</p>
<p>" hitherto practically very useless. But it has its merits. It sepa-
</p>
<p>rates from the throne any ebullition of that anger and just indig-
</p>
<p>" nation which false charges always produce; and it has the effect
</p>
<p>" of visiting that anger and indignation on the heads of the base mi-
</p>
<p>" nistry, who would dare to traduce us. In order to vindicate the peo-
</p>
<p>" pie of Ireland  in order to enable them to decide what course they
</p>
<p>" shall hereafter take, I will bring before the Association those mat-
</p>
<p>" ters of importance with which the present crisis is pregnant. I
</p>
<p>" will endeavour to shew them in detail, and with as much distinct-
</p>
<p>" ness as I possibly can, the state of the Irish people at the com-
</p>
<p>" mencement of the late Session of Parliament, and the Acts of that
</p>
<p>" Session, and I will then direct your attention to our future pros-
</p>
<p>" pects and our future conduct."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I shall now call your attention to a publication in the
</p>
<p>Pilot newspaper, of the 28th of August. The progress of the conspi-
</p>
<p>racy had been carried on to this extent. Every means that could
</p>
<p>suggest themselves to the minds of those engaged in the conspiracy,
</p>
<p>had been used to excite discontent and disaffection in the minds of
</p>
<p>the people of this country. They had been roused to a feeling of
</p>
<p>anger against those who were called their " Saxon oppressors."
</p>
<p>They had been taught their own strength. They had been brought
</p>
<p>together in thousands, from distant parts of the country; they had
</p>
<p>been taught to know the reliance they might place on themselves ;

</p>
<p>discipline had been carried on to a certain extent. But still there
</p>
<p>was a difficulty in their way, for if the army could be depended on,
</p>
<p>they could not carry out the designs. You have already heard seve-
</p>
<p>ral extracts from speeches of Mr. O'Connell, in which he endea-
</p>
<p>voured to excite disaffection amongst the non-commissioned officers
</p>
<p>of the army, by drawing a parallel between the course adopted
</p>
<p>towards them in the English army, and that pursued towards the
</p>
<p>non-commissioned officers in the French army. There was nothing
</p>
<p>new in this. This attempt was taken from the proceedings previous
</p>
<p>to the rebellion of 1798. It was part of the system in 1797, and
</p>
<p>with precisely the same view and object the same attempts were
</p>
<p>made upon the army of that day. In the report of the secret com-
</p>
<p>mittee of the House of Commons, you will find it stated, that while
</p>
<p>the united Irishmen " were maturing their designs, and secretly ac-
</p>
<p>" quiring the strength and consistency of a revolutionary army,
</p>
<p>"they omitted no artifice by which they could hope either to*
</p>
<p>113
</p>
<p>" weaken'or embarrass the government of the country. So early as the
</p>
<p>" year 1792, the seduction of the soldiery made a part of their sys-
</p>
<p>" tern. They were assured that the season was now arrived for itsac-
</p>
<p>" complishment, and no means which wicked subtlety could suggest
</p>
<p>" were left unemployed; printed papers were industriously circulated
</p>
<p>" among the privates and non-commissioned officers, urging them to
</p>
<p>" insubordination and revolt; holding out the most tempting offers of
</p>
<p>" preferment to such as should desert their colours." In the same way
</p>
<p>were causes of grievances suggested to the non-commissioned officers
</p>
<p>in the present instance; and the object of such suggestion was ex-
</p>
<p>plained in the language of Mr. O'Connell, that " when our cause
</p>
<p>" progresses, those grounds of discontent and dissatisfaction will be re-
</p>
<p>" moved." Keeping that in view, I now will call your attention to a
</p>
<p>publication in the Pilot newspaper of the 28th of August ; it is in the
</p>
<p>form of a letter signed, " Richard Power, P.P." and is entitled " The
</p>
<p>" duty of a soldier :" " There are at this instant more men in Ireland
</p>
<p>"who understand their just rights, and who are conscious of their
</p>
<p>" power of asserting them, than ever existed in any nation even of
</p>
<p>"five times its population. " There are three millions of as brave
</p>
<p>" men as ever trod the grass, united as one, a sufficient number to
</p>
<p>" conquer Europe, ready at a signal, and determined to die or have
</p>
<p>" full and ample justice ; and yet I don't fear to assert it, there is not
</p>
<p>" one man amongst them who hopes to obtain one shilling's worth
</p>
<p>" of any man's property, or who intends to do the slightest personal
</p>
<p>" injury to any human being, by joining in the great national revo-
</p>
<p>" lution upon which they are now unalterably determined. This is
</p>
<p>" the highest degree of political training to which a nation ever yet
</p>
<p>" was brought. It is a condition of society which no one ever
</p>
<p>" imagined until the great apostle of peaceful agitation has exhibited
</p>
<p>" it to the astonishment of the world. This, after all, is not de-
</p>
<p>" priving the thief of his physical force, but creating an overwhelming
</p>
<p>" force which he dare not encounter, constructed, however, upon such
</p>
<p>" a principle that no other thief can use it, its animating principle
</p>
<p>" being justice, peace if possible, but peace or war, justice. There

</p>
<p>" is one class of persons whom Mr. O'Connell has not taken into his
</p>
<p>" school in his lectures upon political rights and duties, but who
</p>
<p>" have, it seems, profited, notwithstanding, to some extent by his
</p>
<p>" peaceful doctrines  I mean the military. Mr. O'Connell is tli
</p>
<p>" best abused man in the world ; his motives are misconstrued, his
</p>
<p>" objects misrepresented, his character maligned, his person in-
</p>
<p>" suited, and his character held up to scorn ; his course must be
</p>
<p>" cautious. If he touched upon this subject, he would be cried
</p>
<p>" up at once as an open rebel. It would be said that he wanted to
</p>
<p>" corrupt the soldiery, and withdraw them from their duty. It would
</p>
<p>" be put down as an act of high treason. It was, therefore, con-
</p>
<p>" summate wisdom on his part never even to have alluded to it.
</p>
<p>" His system cannot be perfect, however, it will not embrace every
</p>
<p>" class, through whose agency an oppressed and plundered people
</p>
<p>" can create for themselves a wise, just, and impartial government,
</p>
<p>" without bloodshed, rapine, or any species of crime, unless the
</p>
<p>Q
</p>
<p>114
</p>
<p>' soldiery are instructed in their conscientious duties. The very
</p>
<p>' life and soul of a soldier's profession is to die for his duty ; let the
</p>
<p>' brave soldier therefore know his duty and he will die to perform it ;
</p>
<p>1 but as he every day of his life dares death he will die before he
</p>
<p>1 would exceed it. My present purpose is to explain as clearly
</p>
<p>' as I can what that duty is. I cannot be suspected of corrupting
</p>
<p>' the soldiery or bringing them over to second any views of my own.
</p>
<p>< I can have no political object, no ambitious projects. I took the
</p>
<p>' oath of allegiance, and I shall adhere to it to my death, and my posi-
</p>
<p>( tion in society is immoveably fixed. I can, therefore, have no other
</p>
<p>' object but to state the truth, and as truth and justice must ever go
</p>
<p>' hand in hand, to make the statement of the true doctrine on this
</p>
<p>' point subservient to universal justice as far as it may. I do not
</p>
<p>' presume to be an authority on this most grave and important sub-
</p>
<p>' ject, but stating this publicly what I conceive to be the true doc-
</p>
<p>' trine regarding it I am open to correction. I call upon my fellow-
</p>
<p>' clergymen whose duty it is, to be accurately informed on it, and to
</p>
<p>' communicate that information to all whom it may concern, to set
</p>
<p>' me and the public right when I may have erred. I am sure many
</p>
<p>< of them will be found to do so if I go wrong. A soldier is a
</p>
<p>' person who hires himself to a government for the purpose of slaying
</p>
<p>' his fellow-men. He does not carry destructive weapons for the
</p>
<p>1 purpose of hunting down wild beasts, or butchering sheep or oxen.
</p>
<p>' No ; expressly and distinctly it is to kill his own fellow-creatures.
</p>
<p>' Viewed solely in this light, every feeling of our nature recoils with
</p>
<p>' horror from the profession of a soldier ; and yet the true soldier is
</p>
<p>' a manly, generous, and noble fellow. His duty and his object, it is
</p>
<p> true, is to slay his fellow-man ; but then he is no cut-throat or
</p>
<p>' orangeman. He would sooner be the victim of either than stain his
</p>
<p>' high character with the crime of the one or the infamy of the
</p>
<p>' other. He is not the ready tool of a bloody-minded tyrant, who
</p>
<p>' would employ him to cut down the unarmed and defenceless.
</p>
<p>' He would sooner stand to be shot at than be converted into a
</p>
<p>' murdering man-butcher by any such horrible miscreant. It has

</p>
<p>' been reported of a certain officer now stationed in Ireland, that he
</p>
<p>'attended an assemblage of magistrates held on the eve of one of
</p>
<p>< Mr. O'Connell's great monster meetings, as they are called, and
</p>
<p>' that he offered on just getting a hint to drive a troop of dragoons
</p>
<p> into the body of the meeting, and trample and cut down like weeds
</p>
<p>< men, women, and children ! If it be a fact that this red-coated
</p>
<p> fiend made such an offer, and that it is known to his fellow-officers
</p>
<p>< in the service, and that they now associate with him, I call them
</p>
<p>'to their teeth a pack of cowardly, infamous, unmanly 'scoundrels.
</p>
<p>' He is no soldier. He is not only a disgrace to the character of
</p>
<p>' an officer, but he would be a disgrace to a gang of pirates. No
</p>
<p>' brave man ever made such an offer. A brave man would let
</p>
<p>' himself be blown from a cannon before he would even contem-
</p>
<p>' plate it, and the officers who tolerate such a filthy cannibal amongst
</p>
<p>' them deserve to be sent out to gloat themselves upon human flesh
</p>
<p>' in the congenial companionship of their fellow-savages in the
</p>
<p>115
</p>
<p>" South Sea Islands. Having said thus much upon what is not, I now
</p>
<p>11 come to state what is the duty of a soldier. It is his duty to fight
</p>
<p>" against the enemies of his country, armed for attack, or armed and
</p>
<p>"forewarned for defence. This is the sum and s*ubstauce of his
</p>
<p>"duty; if he is ever employed for any other purpose he is not
</p>
<p>" bound to obey ; but to this duty he is bound to devote every
</p>
<p>" energy of his mind and body in life and death. In action
</p>
<p>11 the soldier is to have no will of his own. It is the right and
</p>
<p>" duty of his commanding officer to point out what he is to
</p>
<p>" do. It is his duty to do it or die, not only as a matter of
</p>
<p>" personal bravery, but as a conscientious duty before God, he is
</p>
<p>" bound to give up all thought of self-preservation, all feelings of
</p>
<p>" humanity towards the enemy, not, however, to the extent of un-
</p>
<p>" necessary cruelty, to weaken and destroy the adversary in every
</p>
<p>" way in his power, and even when he sees that his own death is in
</p>
<p>" evitable, to sell his life as dear as he can. War being once legiti-
</p>
<p>" mately proclaimed, the soldier is a mere instrument in the hands
</p>
<p>" of the government of his country, to be employed by the general
</p>
<p>" placed over him for the destruction of the enemy ; and whatever
</p>
<p>" intellect he possesses he is only to use to carry into effect the com-
</p>
<p>" mands of those in authority over him. It will be said that this is a
</p>
<p>" degrading and debasing condition to place rational beings in who
</p>
<p>" are all-accountable for their actions, and many of whom may be as
</p>
<p>" intelligent and enlightened as the very general whom they are thus
</p>
<p>" blindly required to obey ; but the strength and effectiveness of an
</p>
<p>" army is ever in proportion to the extent to which this spirit pervades
</p>
<p>" the whole mass, men and officers. Prompt, cheerful, and determined
</p>
<p>" resolution to carry the commanding officer's orders into effect, is
</p>
<p>" the whole secret of military discipline. On it alone depends vic-
</p>
<p>" tory : it will tell almost against any odds, and it is therefore that it
</p>
<p>" is a moral duty in a just cause. This is the full extent to which
</p>
<p>" the unreflecting, mechanical obedience required from the soldiery
</p>
<p>" can be carried. It is absolutely impossible that any human autho-
</p>
<p>" rity could exist on earth which could absolve any man in any con-

</p>
<p>" dition or profession from the moral responsibility which attaches to
</p>
<p>" every rational being. The soldier, like every other man who hires
</p>
<p>" himself for any particular business, if required to go beyond it, is
</p>
<p>a not bound to obey ; if it ceases to be legitimate, he is bound not to
</p>
<p>" obey. The soldier is bound to fight against the enemies of his
</p>
<p>" country a just war. This is his sole duty  this is his only obliga-
</p>
<p>" tion ; if commanded to do anything else, he is not bound to obey ;
</p>
<p>" and if he did obey with arms in his hands, when required to do
</p>
<p>" anything unbecoming a soldier, I would call him not only a base
</p>
<p>" slave, but an arrant coward. If the government to which he has
</p>
<p>" engaged his services as a soldier should be so iniquitous as to enter
</p>
<p>" upon a war of plunder or unjust oppression against an unoffending
</p>
<p>" people, he should die before he would participate in such a horrible
</p>
<p>"crime. No supposed obligation, no imaginary duty would jnstify
</p>
<p>" or excuse him before God and the world ; he would be a robber
</p>
<p>" and a murderer if he advanced one step in obedience to any human
</p>
<p>116
</p>
<p>" being for such a wicked purpose. But here arises the embarrassing
</p>
<p>" difficulty to the brave and honest soldier. If, believing the go-
</p>
<p>" vernmentthat would be so depraved as to engage in such a war, would
</p>
<p>" be sure to treat its own soldiery with as great barbarity as it would the
</p>
<p>" unoffending people, and believing the service to be iniquitous ; he
</p>
<p>" disobeys, he is put down as a coward. If he fights he is a mur-
</p>
<p>" derer, and this to be sure is a hard case, but why should a soldier
</p>
<p>" talk of a hard case ? If he be that of a milk-and-water kind of
</p>
<p>" thing that would sit down to bemoan his unhappy fate, what busi-
</p>
<p>" ness had he with the profession of a soldier ? Will not rob ?
</p>
<p>" Will not the brave and honest fellow who would disobey such pirates
</p>
<p>" be tried by court martial and shot at the drum head ? Who
</p>
<p>" will dare then call him a coward? Why nothing but the fear
</p>
<p>" of this world ever makes him take chances of escaping amongst
</p>
<p>" the gang of robbers who would obey, and then who is the real
</p>
<p>" coward ? Clearly the man who would take the chance to escape as
</p>
<p>" the murdering thief, not he who would die sooner than be a villain.
</p>
<p>" The fate of such a fine fellow would no doubt be melancholy.
</p>
<p>" There is no brave or generous man living who would not shed the
</p>
<p>" tear of warm sympathy over his honoured grave. He himself would
</p>
<p>" be the only man who would stand unmoved when the instruments
</p>
<p>" of death would be pointed at him ; his very mnrderers would shud-
</p>
<p>" der at their own crime, while the blessings of all that is good and
</p>
<p>u virtuous on the earth would follow his brave and manly soul before
</p>
<p>" the throne of that God, whom alone he could be made to fear and
</p>
<p>" obey, but whom upon that occasion, at least, he would have no
</p>
<p>" cause to dread. 1 do not, of course, mean to make any practical
</p>
<p>" application of this doctrine to the actual state of this or any other
</p>
<p>" country at the present moment ; I put it forward solely as an adjunct
</p>
<p>" to Mr. O'Connell's general theory of peaceful agitation, which
</p>
<p>" would bring about every amelioration in the condition of mankind,
</p>
<p>" by instructing every class in the community in the moral duties they
</p>
<p>" owe to each other. The military have been in all ages the most
</p>
<p>" powerful class  when ignorant, depraved, and blood-thirsty they

</p>
<p>" have been invariably employed for the plunder and oppression of
</p>
<p>" their fellow-men ; when intelligent, moral, and generous, they have
</p>
<p>" ever been the protectors of the people, the defenders of their li-
</p>
<p>" berties, and the scourges of their tyrants. It is therefore essential
</p>
<p>" that they should be included in the grand scheme for the universal
</p>
<p>" regeneration of mankind by intellectual instruction alone. If this
</p>
<p>" short notice of this extremely important subject should contribute
</p>
<p>" to bring it under general discussion, it will be doing good service.
</p>
<p>" If any one differs from my views regarding it I shall be glad to have
</p>
<p>" his reasons. I undertake to go fully with him into it, and to define
</p>
<p>" and demonstrate the moral duty of the soldier under all possible
</p>
<p>" circumstances  in peace and war, at home and abroad. As a be-
</p>
<p>" ginning, to mark out these two or three prominent points, about
</p>
<p>" which there can be but little rational controversy, is perhaps quite
</p>
<p>" enough." There can be no misunderstanding this publication. In the
</p>
<p>early part it alluded to the effect created by the vast number of persons
</p>
<p>117
</p>
<p>which the system of organization had brought together, and then spoke
</p>
<p>of the necessity of obtaining what is called justice, by peace if pos-
</p>
<p>sible, but peace or war, justice, meaning thereby a Repeal of the
</p>
<p>Union. That was to be obtained by peaceable means, by the demon-
</p>
<p>stration of physical force, if possible, but if that did not succeed,
</p>
<p>" peace or war, justice." It is thought right to impress this on the
</p>
<p>minds of the soldiers, that if the government acting on the principle
</p>
<p>of their predecessors, declared by a minister of the Crown, that a
</p>
<p>civil war was preferable to the dismemberment of the empire, was
</p>
<p>driven to (he necessity of protecting the loyal subjects of the Crown,
</p>
<p>by the aid of the military, they, the military, were not bound to obey.
</p>
<p>That is the mode by which they are to have what they called a
</p>
<p>bloodless revolution. The sergeants of the army are to pronounce
</p>
<p>as they did in Spain, the military are to coalesce with them ; and by
</p>
<p>that means they are to. effect a dismemberment of the empire.
</p>
<p>I now come to another meeting of the Association, which was
</p>
<p>held on the 4th of September. On that occasion, Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>made a speech, in which he said : " I want no revolution, or, if any,
</p>
<p>" only a return to former times ; such a revolution as that of 1782,
</p>
<p>" or 1829  a bloodless, stainless revolution, a political change for the
</p>
<p>" better ; but who can tell me that we have not sufficient resources
</p>
<p>"remaining, even if our present plans should be defeated? The
</p>
<p>" people of Ireland might increase the potato culture and leave the
</p>
<p>" entire harvest of Ireland uncut. What would be the remedy for
</p>
<p>" that? Who could tell me that the repealers of every class might
</p>
<p>"not totally give up the consumption of exciseable articles? I
</p>
<p>" throw out these things merely to show, that if the diabolical at-
</p>
<p>" tempt to create bloodshed should succeed, the people would not
</p>
<p>" be deprived of their resources, and the means of vindicating their
</p>
<p>" cause." To leave the harvest to rot on the ground ; to give up
</p>
<p>the use of exciseable articles,  these were the legal, the constitu-
</p>
<p>tional modes by which Mr. O'Connell tells the Association that they
</p>
<p>are to obtain the repeal of the Union. I find, that in the report of
</p>
<p>the Secret Committee of the House of Commons in 1798, to which

</p>
<p>I have before referred, an allusion to a similar plan which was
</p>
<p>adopted by the united Irishmen, to give up the use of exciseable arti-
</p>
<p>cles. One would suppose that the leaders of the repeal movement had
</p>
<p>been studying the history of the rebellion of 1798, and endeavouring,
</p>
<p>as far as they could, to model their conduct according to that standard,
</p>
<p>and to adopt and imitate, with as much safety as possible, the principles
</p>
<p>and acts of that day, as they were pompously called. Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>proceeds : " but of course I do not suggest them. The harvest is
</p>
<p>" now cut. I speak the day after the fair, and therefore with parti-
</p>
<p>" cular safety. A resolution for the non-consumption of exciseable
</p>
<p>" and customable articles is not proposed at present. It is reserved
</p>
<p>" for a greater exigency ; but I am far from saying that it may not
</p>
<p>" be proposed. I will shrink from nothing, I will state candidly
</p>
<p>" every thing; and I come now to the actual state in which we are
</p>
<p>'' placed. The repeal wardens will be in the nature of returning
</p>
<p>" officers ; and the Queen may even direct writs to them by that de-
</p>
<p>118
</p>
<p>" signalion ; that is what I want. I do not want representation, or
</p>
<p>" any thing like it. The repeal wardens will have no representative
</p>
<p>" or delegated authority; they are appointed for the ascertainment
</p>
<p>" of a particular fact. I wish that to be understood, not only here,
</p>
<p>" but in the Attorney General's office. I repeat, that the appoint-
</p>
<p>" ment of repeal wardens is distinct from the Preservative Society.
</p>
<p>" Many gentlemen of high station are willing to become members of
</p>
<p>" the society. They are ready to make any sacrifice ; they are
</p>
<p>" ready to receive any penalty, even death ; but I will take care to
</p>
<p>" keep them safe, that is my duty, that is my professional business."
</p>
<p>In another part of his address he said : "I shall be at a meeting in
</p>
<p>" Connemara on the Sunday after next, when I shall certainly have
</p>
<p>** 150,000 men to meet me ; but my object is to bring your attention
</p>
<p>" more immediately to my plan, for a Preservative Association. We
</p>
<p>" must first arrange, that when the event arrives, when the Queen
</p>
<p>" shall issue, by virtue of her prerogative, her summons to the Irish
</p>
<p>" Parliament, she maybe able to direct her summonses to the different
</p>
<p>" constituencies. Our plan on that subject will soon be ready for
</p>
<p>" circulation among the Irish people ; and taking the Reform Bill as
</p>
<p>" our basis, we will soon have every thing arranged." Alluding to
</p>
<p>the council of three hundred, he says : " As I am counsel for Ireland,
</p>
<p>" I promise you faithfully that the Preservative Association shall
</p>
<p>" not come within the Convention Act, or any other Act of a penal
</p>
<p>" nature. I promise you to have the arrangement so complete, that
</p>
<p>u it will be as safe to sit in the presence of the Attorney General as
</p>
<p>" in that of the present meeting, if it had the power of deciding
</p>
<p>" upon fact and law on the subject. Looking before and around
</p>
<p>" me, I see no prospect of any thing being done for Ireland,
</p>
<p>" except through the medium of the Association. The landlords
</p>
<p>" stand aloof, and will not join us ; 1 tell them they are mad. They do
</p>
<p>" not understand the signs of the times. I hold out to them the
</p>
<p>" hand of friendship and assistance. I am ready to make arrange-
</p>
<p>*' ments that will consult even their feelings as well as their real in-
</p>
<p>" terests ; but if they leave me alone, and more animated persons

<p>" about me press me, while they will not give me succour or assist-
</p>
<p>" ance, let the evil fall on them. It is their folly not to join their
</p>
<p>" country, and it will be their punishment hereafter not to have
</p>
<p>"joined in proper time. Who will tell me the Queen's speech is to
</p>
<p>" satisfy us for these things ? It expresses deep concern for the agi-
</p>
<p>" tation in Ireland. There will be agitation in Ireland, and there
</p>
<p>" shall be agitation in Ireland, and there must be agitation in Ire-
</p>
<p>" land. Yes, until the moment when our grievances are redressed,
</p>
<p>" and we have a parliament in College-green." There happens,
</p>
<p>gentlemen of the jury, to be such a Statute as the Convention Act;
</p>
<p>but in order to evade its provisions, these three hundred gentlemen
</p>
<p>were to meet, as it were by accident, in Dublin ; the people were to
</p>
<p>subscribe 100, which was to be given to each of these three hun-
</p>
<p>dred persons, with a view of their being looked on as delegates.
</p>
<p>They were to separate and meet again, and to dine together. That
</p>
<p>was to be purely an accidental circumstance. That was one of the
</p>
<p>119
</p>
<p>plans by which the objects of the conspiracy were to be carried into
</p>
<p>effect. If it had not been checked, it is impossible to say to what
</p>
<p>lengths it would ultimately have proceeded.
</p>
<p>I will now call your attention to another publication in the Pilot
</p>
<p>newspaper, of the 6th of September, on the subject of the army.
</p>
<p>This is not simply a letter, but it has been published as one of the
</p>
<p>articles of the newspaper. It is headed " The Irish in the English
</p>
<p>army; it is as follows : " Mr. O'Callaghan's letters. No subject in
</p>
<p>" the present state of the public mind in Ireland can be more inte-
</p>
<p>" resting than the state of the army. If the press did not at length
</p>
<p>" interfere, we really believe there would have been no bounds set
</p>
<p>" to the persecutions of the private soldier. And for what, we ask, has
</p>
<p>" he been visited with this annoyance? Is not the soldier an impro-
</p>
<p>" ving member of society ? So much is this the case, that during the
</p>
<p>" late government, libraries were ordered to be established for every
</p>
<p>" regiment in the service. And yet we published no later than last
</p>
<p>" Monday, a letter, forbidding the soldiers of the 43rd light infan-
</p>
<p>" try, stationed at Montreal, from reading the Weekly Register,
</p>
<p>" although the poor fellows had subscribed in advance for that paper.
</p>
<p>" But if the soldier can read, he can easily find something to read,
</p>
<p>" and we have heard that the men when they go out to refresh them-
</p>
<p>" selves, always call for the prohibited papers. If the newspapers
</p>
<p>" are not palatable to military martinets or drill-murderers, what
</p>
<p>" shall they say to the writings of the author of the 'Green Book'
</p>
<p>" being rendered accessible to the soldiery ? This gentleman, the
</p>
<p>" Irish public are aware, was the first who revealed the secret of the
</p>
<p>" composition of the army in reply to that unprincipled publication,
</p>
<p>" the English Standard. That paper, forsooth, would threaten the
</p>
<p>" Irish nation with the army, if they merely discussed the subject of
</p>
<p>" the repeal of the Union ? However, we soon found a champion
</p>
<p>" in the person of Mr. O'Callaghan. He silenced the Standard by
</p>
<p>" analysing the army, and showing that above forty-one thousand
</p>
<p>" Paddies served in that force! Those facts appeared in the shape
</p>
<p>" of letters, directed to Mr. Staunton, of the Register, and Mr.

<p>" Kay. They were also printed in the Pilot, whose columns are
</p>
<p>" always open to the complaints of the poor soldier. Nothing at the
</p>
<p>" time, as far as we recollect, created so much excitement and inte-
</p>
<p>" rest as those letters. They are now much augmented and im-
</p>
<p>" proved, and published under the characteristic title of  The Irish
</p>
<p>" in the English army and navy.' In the annals of cheap publication,
</p>
<p>" we have never seen any thing to equal them  twenty-four pages of
</p>
<p>" close letter-press for one penny! As for what they contain,
</p>
<p>" we need only say, that they are one mass of authorities and quota-
</p>
<p>" tions. Those letters put the question in a nutshell. They are
</p>
<p>" alike suited for the pocket of the citizen and the knapsack of the
</p>
<p>" soldier. The author may well observe in his preface, indeed, since
</p>
<p>" the Spanish army have ventured to pronounce that orders to fire
</p>
<p>" upon one's fellow-subjects are not in every case to be obeyed, in-
</p>
<p>" asmuch as those orders may not always be founded on justice ; and
</p>
<p>" when not so founded, can, if obeyed, be only complied with in vio-
</p>
<p>120
</p>
<p>" lation of the solemn commandment, ' Thou shalt do no murder.'
</p>
<p>" Since the patriotic Spanish army, like that of France at the revo-
</p>
<p>" lution, have so presumed to think, and to prove they think, that
</p>
<p>" soldiers are not always to be counted upon as mere unreasoning or
</p>
<p>" conscienceless herds of wholesale and unconditional man-butchers,
</p>
<p>" whenever the aristocrat oppressors of the community, under the
</p>
<p>" designation of government, may command the people to be massa-
</p>
<p>" cred for not submitting to injustice ; since the fresh moral lesson
</p>
<p>" has been pronounced for all whom it may concern ; it is difficult
</p>
<p>" to perceive, even independent of the circumstance of so many of
</p>
<p>" the military being known repealers, how the great mass of our
</p>
<p>" army can be reckoned on to uphold, at the expense of their own,
</p>
<p>" as well as the people's cause, the supremacy of an oligarchy, whose
</p>
<p>" generosity, gratitude, and tenderness to the soldiery for so doing,
</p>
<p>" consist of promotion to commissions only for the rich ; the mang-
</p>
<p>" ling lash to the bleeding back, and such merciless drillings as have
</p>
<p>" caused poor private M'Manus to drop down dead, and private
</p>
<p>" George Jubee, a soldier of acknowledged good character, to send,
</p>
<p>" in desperation, a bullet, through adjutant Robertson Mackay's body.
</p>
<p>" Aye, there's the rub, as Mr. O'Callaghan so forcibly observes ; and his
</p>
<p>" able and universally-accessible publication, from which the above
</p>
<p>" extract is taken, is one of the best hand-grenades that could be di-
</p>
<p>" rected against the abuses of such a system. It should be circu-
</p>
<p>" lated in every direction." I could read some publications in 1797,
</p>
<p>from the Press newspaper of that day, of exactly the same tendency.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett has taken care, to the best of his abilities, that these
</p>
<p>publications should be brought under the notice of the army, and
</p>
<p>that they might always be found in the soldier's knapsack.
</p>
<p>The view taken by the Government, of this agitation, appeared
</p>
<p>clearly from Her Majesty's speech on the 26th of August, but this
</p>
<p>had no effect whatever among the members of this Association, for
</p>
<p>on the 10th of September, another multitudinous meeting took place
</p>
<p>at Loughrea, at which Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Barrett, Mr. Steele, and
</p>
<p>Dr. Gray were present. The rain however happened to set in in the

</p>
<p>morning, when Mr. O'Connell addressed the assembled multitude,
</p>
<p>and said : " That he regretted the weather prevented him from
</p>
<p>" giving full expression to his gratitude ; but they had high authority
</p>
<p>" for saying, that the rain fell upon the just as well as upon the un-
</p>
<p>" just. He could not avoid saying that Connaught had done its du-
</p>
<p>" ty  Connaught was determined that Ireland should be free. He
</p>
<p>" was delighted to see such a body of people coming together and
</p>
<p>" conducting themselves like the higher orders  the higher orders,
</p>
<p>" bah! He had physical power enough at his command to produce
</p>
<p>" the greatest revolution that ever was effected, and yet that meet-
</p>
<p>" ing was as tranquil, as orderly, as submissive as if the youngest per-
</p>
<p>" sons in the community had assembled together for their recreation
</p>
<p>" or amusement. The Saxon stranger shall not rule over Ireland 
</p>
<p>" it shall belong to the Irish, and the Irish shall have Ireland. You
</p>
<p>" shall have the Repeal." At the dinner on the same day, in res-
</p>
<p>ponding to the toast of " the people," Mr. Barrett made use of the
</p>
<p>121
</p>
<p>following among other observations : " I am from long, close, and at-
</p>
<p>" tentive observation of the Irish people convinced that were their
</p>
<p>" virtuous tranquillity set at nought ; were they by aggression in-
</p>
<p>" volved in a conflict which conscience would approve and necessity
</p>
<p>" justify ; there is in the organization, the numbers, the nature of the
</p>
<p>" country, and the spirit of the people at this moment, in their sense
</p>
<p>" of wrong and love of right ; in their deep conviction of all that
</p>
<p>" would be lost by defeat and won by victory  a mighty power which
</p>
<p>" would defeat the calculations and the manoeuvring of military tac-
</p>
<p>" tics ; and that great, admired, and prominent as we are now in the
</p>
<p>" arts of peace, if driven to it, this people would be found still more
</p>
<p>" astonishing in military valour, and that prowess which would render
</p>
<p>" their outbreak irresistible, and their country free." At the same
</p>
<p>dinner Mr. O'Connell stated: " That the Ministry had but one ar-
</p>
<p>" row in their quiver, and out they came with it in the Queen's speech.
</p>
<p>" Oh ! what a trick it was  it was worse than even a scolding match
</p>
<p>" between two fishwomen, for the fishwoman would give her antago-
</p>
<p>" nist a power of replying to her, but they kept all the scolding on one
</p>
<p>" side. 'Twas an unfair advantage Judy you took of us." There's
</p>
<p>the way the Queen's speech was spoken of by the members of the
</p>
<p>National Repeal Association. " You took an unfair advantage of us
</p>
<p>Judy." In another part of his address at that dinner, he says: " My
</p>
<p>maxim is, he who commits a crime gives strength to the enemy." I
</p>
<p>think the jury perfectly well understand now what that term means.
</p>
<p>He then added : " It has been my political maxim through life, al-
</p>
<p>" ways to keep a look out for the breakers ahead, and to keep clear
</p>
<p>" of shoal water, and I will undertake to guide the bark of Irish li-
</p>
<p>" berty into the harbour of safety." Dr. Gray spoke at the same din-
</p>
<p>ner, to the toast of " the Repeal Press.'' He said : " I cannot but
</p>
<p>" congratulate the men of Loughrea on the glorious demonstration
</p>
<p>" I have this day witnessed. As a Connaughtman I feel proud of
</p>
<p>" the bold attitude assumed by my countrymen, and having had
</p>
<p>" many opportunities, during the present struggle, of seeing Repeal
</p>
<p>" demonstrations, I am bound in justice to the men of Loughrea

</p>
<p>" and its vicinity to tell them my opinion of the meeting of that day.
</p>
<p>" I have been present at demonstrations in the east, in the west, in
</p>
<p>" the south, and in the north ; but never did I behold a scene that
</p>
<p>" inspired me with more of hope in the ultimate destiny of my coun-
</p>
<p>" try, and that gave me more of confidence in the power and vitality
</p>
<p>" of the mighty spirit of nationality that was now vivifying the land
</p>
<p>" than that which we have just beheld. If, however, I feel pride in
</p>
<p>" witnessing such a scene, how much greater should be the gratifi-
</p>
<p>" cation I would experience at being enabled to do my duty to them
</p>
<p>" and to the country, by sending to the four corners of the globe a
</p>
<p>" faithful portrait of that magnificent display." In speaking of the
</p>
<p>numbers who attended that meeting, Dr. Gray said : " There are
</p>
<p>" numbers  there is order  there is precision  but above all, deter-
</p>
<p>" mination was stamped on every brow, and was uttered by every
</p>
<p>" voice ; and am I to be told that such a people are to be driven from
</p>
<p>" their purpose by either the seductions or the frowns of a minister,
</p>
<p>R
</p>
<p>122
</p>
<p>" whether uttered by himself or put forth as a royal speech ? They
</p>
<p>" threatened before ; but when the indignant people hurled defiance at
</p>
<p>" them, they sneaked like cowed rats before their frown. Afraid
</p>
<p>" again to threaten, they have the meanness to thrust an innocent and
</p>
<p>" beauteous lady as a shield between themselves and the just wrath
</p>
<p>" of an indignant nation, and they have forced her to proclaim slavery
</p>
<p>" for the people of this land, as if they fancied that such a device
</p>
<p>" could affect the great national movement. What do the men of
</p>
<p>" Ireland care for the ministerial manifesto ? What do the bold
</p>
<p>u peasantry of Connaught care for it ? It will be by them treated
</p>
<p>" with utter disregard. It was not the speech of the Sovereign. Is
</p>
<p>" it not the speech of a minister, who, fearing again to insult the Irish
</p>
<p>" nation, has the cowardice to do it through a woman ? But [even
</p>
<p>" were that speech in unison with the sentiments of the Queen,
</p>
<p>" would the nation fear because of the opposition she might be ad-
</p>
<p>" vised to give to their just demand? No, we will not halt or hesi-
</p>
<p>" tate even because of the personal opposition of the Sovereign.
</p>
<p>" When her idiot grandfather opposed himself, with all the virulence
</p>
<p>" of his vicious nature, to the emancipation of the Catholics, did the
</p>
<p>" people fear to go on ? His hostility was evinced in accordance with
</p>
<p>" the wish of the minister, as well as against the ministerial advice.
</p>
<p>" He opposed the Catholic emancipation, because he hated the Irish
</p>
<p>" and their religion with a bigoted hatred, yet the people, nothing
</p>
<p>" daunted by his impotent opposition, pursued their course regard-
</p>
<p>" less of his whims, and forced even from him large concessions.
</p>
<p>" The movement has now assumed a form that bids defiance to any
</p>
<p>" and every opposition ; and though those who know not the hearts
</p>
<p>" of the people may hope to damp their ardour by such silly courses,
</p>
<p>" there is this day given to the minister a substantial proof that the
</p>
<p>" men of Connaught, at least, will never lower the standard of Re-
</p>
<p>" peal, but that they will continue to rally round the Liberator till
</p>
<p>" he has consummated the legislative independence of the country."
</p>
<p>On the 10th of September, a meeting was held of the Associa-
</p>
<p>tion, at which Mr. O'Connell, Mr. John O'Connell, Mr. Steele, Mr.

</p>
<p>Barrett, and Dr. Gray were present. Dr. Gray said : " I have been
</p>
<p>" commissioned by the committee of arbitration, to report progress.
</p>
<p>" Circulars have been forwarded to the repeal wardens and clergy, in
</p>
<p>" pursuance of the report previously adopted by the Association.
</p>
<p>" Deeds of submission, and all the necessary documents have been
</p>
<p>" procured, and are ready to be sent down to the country, so that
</p>
<p>" the plan is now fit to be carried into operation. The committee
</p>
<p>" have received many letters from ex-justices of the peace and other
</p>
<p>" persons, with reference to the appointment of arbitrators." Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell on that occasion said : " I am delighted the time has
</p>
<p>" arrived in which it will be no longer necessary for the people to re-
</p>
<p>" fer their differences for settlement to the magisterial authorities
</p>
<p>" constituted by law ; they will have their own arbitrators, as my
</p>
<p>" great object is to supersede all necessity for the people applying to
</p>
<p>" the magistrates appointed by law." That declaration, so made by
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, shows that his object, and that of the Association,
</p>
<p>was to usurp the prerogative of the Crown, and to endeavour to es-
</p>
<p>123
</p>
<p>tablish throughout the country, courts for the administration of the
</p>
<p>law, which should supersede the tribunals legally constituted by the
</p>
<p>authority of the Crown.
</p>
<p>On the 13th of September, a meeting was held at the Association,
</p>
<p>at which Mr. O'Connell, Mr. John O'Connell, Mr. Ray, and Mr.
</p>
<p>Steele attended. I have already stated, that on the 29th of Au-
</p>
<p>gust, the Queen's speech having arrived in Dublin, Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>gave notice of a counter manifesto  an address to the subjects of
</p>
<p>the British Crown, in every part of the world, containing a detail of
</p>
<p>what he called the grievances of the people, and stating the mode by
</p>
<p>which those grievances were to be remedied. This is not the place
</p>
<p>for entering into a discussion of what are to be called grievances ; nor
</p>
<p>are you, gentlemen, or the Court, to decide, whether grievances
</p>
<p>do exist, or not ; you are only to consider whether the course pur-
</p>
<p>sued by the traversers in this combination and conspiracy, is a legal
</p>
<p>course for the purpose of carrying out their object. This manifesto
</p>
<p>then goes on to state, that there is no hope of obtaining redress for
</p>
<p>what were called grievances, by legal or constitutional means, and
</p>
<p>the mode by which they are to be remedied is pointed out by lan-
</p>
<p>guage which is not equivocal. I shall read the concluding passages
</p>
<p>of it : " Lastly, to crown all, they conclude the session with a speech
</p>
<p>" which they cause the Queen to pronounce; of course the minis-
</p>
<p>" ter's speech, full of sound and fury : giving us for all relief and re-
</p>
<p>" dress, for all conciliation and kindness, the absurdity of ministerial
</p>
<p>" assertion, and the insolence of half-whipped ministerial anger. Fel-
</p>
<p>" low-subjects, our case is before you, and before the world, Griev-
</p>
<p>" ances, such as the Irish people endure, no other country has ever
</p>
<p>" suffered. Insults, such as are offered to us, were never inflicted
</p>
<p>" on any other. There is one consolation : it is admitted by all, and is
</p>
<p>" as clear as the noon-day sun, that unless we redress ourselves, we
</p>
<p>" can have no succour from any other quarter; but we suffice for
</p>
<p>" ourselves and our country, we suffice for the repeal. We expect
</p>
<p>" nothing from England or Englishmen, from Scotland or Scotch-
</p>
<p>" men. In each of those countries the benevolent few are over-

</p>
<p>" powered by the anti-national antipathy to Ireland, and the virulent
</p>
<p>" bigotry against the Catholic religion, of the overwhelming majority
</p>
<p>" of both England and Scotland. The present Parliament has been
</p>
<p>" packed, with the aid of the most flagitious bribery, to oppress and
</p>
<p>" crush the Irish nation. From them there is neither redress
</p>
<p>" nor even hope. But, Irishmen, we suffice for ourselves. Stand
</p>
<p>" together ; continue together in peaceful conduct, in loyal at-
</p>
<p>" tachment to the throne, in constitutional exertion, and in none
</p>
<p>" other. Stand together, and persevere, and Ireland shall have her
</p>
<p>" Parliament again. Such are the words we address to our fellow-
</p>
<p>" subjects all over the globe :  signed by order, Daniel O'Connell,
</p>
<p>" chairman of the Committee." Mr. O'Connell moved that this ad-
</p>
<p>dress should be printed on a broad sheet, and circulated throughout
</p>
<p>England, Ireland, and the Colonies. The motion was carried una-
</p>
<p>nimously, by acclamation. In it he distinctly pronounces, and the
</p>
<p>Association adopt the statement, that there was no hope of redress
</p>
<p>from Parliament, and that they sufficed for themselves; that the Irish
</p>
<p>124
</p>
<p>people must look to themselves alone for redress ; and that unless
</p>
<p>they redress themselves, they should not get it from any other quar-
</p>
<p>ter. He then speaks of a constitutional mode of redress, but he
</p>
<p>omits to say what it is. It might be, that the Association considered
</p>
<p>that a demonstration of physical force was a constitutional mode. It is
</p>
<p>for you to say, when you consider the organization that exists through-
</p>
<p>out the country, whether you are of opinion that those grievances
</p>
<p>were to be redressed by Parliament or by the Irish themselves.
</p>
<p>This address was to be circulated through the country by means of
</p>
<p>the repeal press ; but being apprehensive that they would not give it
</p>
<p>sufficient circulation, it was to be printed on a broad sheet, and to be
</p>
<p>circulated in every part of the United Kingdom.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I think the mode by which the Irish were to right
</p>
<p>themselves, is more unequivocally pointed out at the next monster
</p>
<p>meeting, because, as the conspiracy was progressing, the mask was
</p>
<p>removed by degrees ; and matters, which at the early part of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy might have been made the subject of doubt or of argu-
</p>
<p>ment, were adopted when this conspiracy advanced in its proceedings;
</p>
<p>day by day the pretexts with which the meetings were convened
</p>
<p>were discarded, and the real objects ceased to be concealed. The
</p>
<p>meeting to which I would call your attention, was held at Clifden, on
</p>
<p>the 17th of September, four days after the Association had pronoun-
</p>
<p>ced the opinion, that redress for them was not to be obtained from
</p>
<p>the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Dr. Gray, who was pre-
</p>
<p>sent at that meeting, gives an account of it in his paper, and in his
</p>
<p>description of that meeting, of which he was an eye-witness, he said
</p>
<p>the horsemen came to the meeting in troops of peasant cavalry, that
</p>
<p>they had repeal cards in their hats, tied on with green ribbons,
</p>
<p>and that this cavalry was headed by farmers with cards also tied
</p>
<p>on with green ribbons. These corps of cavalry were preceded
</p>
<p>by bands, and it was not unimportant to remark that those bands
</p>
<p>were in every instance dressed in uniform. Hundreds of thou-
</p>
<p>sands came to that meeting marching in the order described, and
</p>
<p>preceded by the bands in uniform, and wearing green scarfs and

</p>
<p>ribbons. They also carried banners, on which were inscribed mot-
</p>
<p>toes recording the victories achieved in the olden time by the Irish
</p>
<p>people. Were not such things calculated to excite and irritate
</p>
<p>the feelings of the people? At that meeting Mr. O'Connell was
</p>
<p>present, and made a speech to the people. Gentlemen, you will
</p>
<p>again recollect that this was the next monster meeting that took
</p>
<p>place subsequent to the meeting of the Association at which the
</p>
<p>address had been adopted, and at which it was recommended
</p>
<p>by Mr. O'Connell that the Irish people should redress them-
</p>
<p>selves. Mr. O'Connell spoke at Clifden as follows : " I had no
</p>
<p>u doubt at all that the women of Connemara were as handsome
</p>
<p>" and modest-looking as any in the world. That opinion has
</p>
<p>" been abundantly confirmed by the beauteous scene I have beheld
</p>
<p>" to-day. But I came here to make an experiment on the men. I
</p>
<p>M have them, and now I will make my experiment on them. I want
</p>
<p>" to know whether you are not as brave and as Irish as the rest of
</p>
<p>125
</p>
<p>" the nation ? I want to know whether you are not as honest, as true,
</p>
<p>" as faithful as the rest of your countrymen? I want to know whe-
</p>
<p>" ther you do not hate Saxon tyranny as much as the natives of other
</p>
<p>" parts of Ireland ? I want to know whether you do not feel the
</p>
<p>" evils of misgovernment as much as the people of any other part of
</p>
<p>" Ireland? You have no commerce. And where are your manu-
</p>
<p>'.' factures? Oh! you have no manufactures. Why? Because Ire-
</p>
<p>" land is governed by Saxons, and not by Irishmen. Will you join
</p>
<p>" me to give Ireland to the Irish ?" This was the address of the
</p>
<p>chairman of the committee, who passed the address at the Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation a few days previous, telling them that they had no hope from
</p>
<p>Parliament, that they should redress themselves. He told those
</p>
<p>misguided people they had no commerce or manufactures, but he
</p>
<p>did not tell them that the cause of it was the pernicious system of
</p>
<p>agitation which has been the curse of this country. He did not tell
</p>
<p>them that the agitation kept the English capitalists out of the country,
</p>
<p>that it is the insecurity to property which prevents the English capital,
</p>
<p>the Saxon capital, from flowing into this country. He did not tell them
</p>
<p>that if they had no commerce or manufactures, they had no person to
</p>
<p>thank but those who were the leaders of this conspiracy, and this As-
</p>
<p>sociation. In another part of his speech he says: " My experiment is
</p>
<p>u satisfied. I can now tell the rest of the three provinces that Con-
</p>
<p>" naught is as determined as they are  you cannot be more so my
</p>
<p>" friends. If the battle were to be fought, I know you would be in
</p>
<p>" the front rank, but there would be as brave hearts, and as ready
</p>
<p>" hands by you. But the battle of Ireland is a peaceable battle,
</p>
<p>M and there is no occasion for warfare. There is no occasion for hos-
</p>
<p>" tility. I will keep you out of danger and conduct you in the con-
</p>
<p>" stitutional ways of the law and national exertion. Yes, if it were
</p>
<p>" necessary for me to call out your force in battle, I am sure there
</p>
<p>" is not a man of you who would not come again on the day I asked
</p>
<p>" him. I know it, and I will tell you why it is unnecessary, because
</p>
<p>" your enemies know it as well as I do." At the same meeting Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell further said : " I have demonstrated that I have more

</p>
<p>" men of a fighting age (why should I not use that word?) ready to
</p>
<p>" stand by their country, than ever evinced that determination be-
</p>
<p>" fore. I say to England, we will use no violence, we will make no
</p>
<p>" attack, we will reserve our force for defence, but attack us if you
</p>
<p>" dare. What is the answer? We do not intend to attack you, and
</p>
<p>" you need not set us at defiance. My reply is the schoolboy's, ' thank
</p>
<p>" you for nothing says the gallipot.' But then they say, how can you
</p>
<p>" carry repeal ? If you take a single additional step we will go to
</p>
<p>" law with you. My answer is, that I am an old lawyer, and the pro-
</p>
<p>" verb says you cannot catch old birds with chaff", and they are not able
</p>
<p>" to beat an old lawyer with chaff at all events. I set your chaff at
</p>
<p>" defiance, and will take the next step in spite of you. We are ap-
</p>
<p>" pointing men to act as arbitrators in the room of the magistrates
</p>
<p>" who were struck off, and thosewho are left in the commission, who
</p>
<p>" are infinitely worse. Last year Goulburn took off the duty on ar-
</p>
<p>" bitration, as if he actually had seen what was coming." In a subse-
</p>
<p>12G
</p>
<p>quent part of his speech he added : " Do they think they will catch an
</p>
<p>" old bird with chaff ? You will see in the newspapers a report of the
</p>
<p>" first Court of Arbitration, which will sit on Friday next, Doctor
</p>
<p>" Gray in the chair. It will sit every Friday; afterwards they will
</p>
<p>" spread through the country. We have had a number of applica-
</p>
<p>" tions for the establishment of Courts in various parts of Ireland,
</p>
<p>" and I am convinced that it will work well. Disputes which now
</p>
<p>" fester and rankle in a village will be settled amicably. It will spread
</p>
<p>" further; I will apply the principle to a higher class of cases. We
</p>
<p>" will appoint arbitrators for everything the people maj r choose, and
</p>
<p>" I trust before I am twelve months older to take half the business
</p>
<p>" out of the superior Courts. This is laying the basis of a judicial
</p>
<p>" system, and above all it is safe  I defy all the Crown lawyers to
</p>
<p>" find a flaw in the plan." Well might Mr. Duffy say they had all the
</p>
<p>incidents of a nation,  taxation, justice, almost legislation, and I may
</p>
<p>add organization. He further said : "for the present year my mon-
</p>
<p>" ster meetings are nearly over, there will not be above seven or
</p>
<p>" eight more of them, but before I have done with them, the demon-
</p>
<p>" stration of moral combination, and of the mighty giant power of
</p>
<p>" the people of Ireland will be complete. Their subordination will
</p>
<p>" be complete. Their discipline will be complete. Why you saw
</p>
<p>" how the cavalry fell in and took their station, four by four, at the
</p>
<p>" word of command of Tom Steele. No aide-de-camp of the Lord
</p>
<p>" Lieutenant was ever obeyed so cheerfully as he was."
</p>
<p>The next meeting took place at Lismore, on the 24th of Septem-
</p>
<p>ber, Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Steele, and Mr. Barrett were present. Flags
</p>
<p>and banners were conspicuous there. Mr. OConnell addressed the
</p>
<p>assembled multitude, and asked them " if you are wanted by me
</p>
<p>again will you not come ?" When such observations as these were
</p>
<p>made, it was not wonderful that at Baltinglass the people should
</p>
<p>have said, "the time is nigher than you think." He farther said : "some
</p>
<p>" of my friends spoke of the impression we have made on France,
</p>
<p>" on America, and on Europe, doubtless we have made such impres-
</p>
<p>" sions on these places ; but I can also tell you, that we have made a

</p>
<p>" deep impression on the English, and they are beginning to see and
</p>
<p>" understand the Irish, and by and by they might attempt to bribe
</p>
<p>" them. They may talk of compromise. Compromise to the winds!
</p>
<p>" I will have no compromise. I have planted my standard, and I will
</p>
<p>" stand to it through weal or woe, for on that standard is engraven re-
</p>
<p>" peal. I have enjoyed much of the confidence of the people, perhaps
</p>
<p>" no man undignified by the title of king or monarch, ever en-
</p>
<p>" joyed so much popularity, and I may add, that it has happened
</p>
<p>" once or twice that I have been abused by some kings, but I never
</p>
<p>" returned the compliment. I believe it never happened, that a man
</p>
<p>" like me possessed so much power ; my wishes are obeyed as law ;
</p>
<p>" and I am persuaded I have no other way of working out my salva-
</p>
<p>" tion, than by working out good for my fellow-man  it is my voca-
</p>
<p>" tion under heaven." At the dinner he said : " Look at the state
</p>
<p>"of Ireland ; the entire nation has pronounced that they have ceased
</p>
<p>" to be slaves, because the light of freedom has beamed upon them.
</p>
<p>127
</p>
<p>" They have pronounced their determination not to remain longer
</p>
<p>" the victims of an alien Parliament ; and let them wait for a while;
</p>
<p>" I am one of the wait-a-whiles ; allow the progress to be kept a se-
</p>
<p>" cret, not from ourselves, for we have nothing to fear. Aye, in
</p>
<p>" Mallow, things looked more threatening; they were ready to bring
</p>
<p>" their horse, foot, and artillery on us ; but in that very Mallow I
</p>
<p>" hurled at them my high anil haughty defiance. I told them they
</p>
<p>" could not conquer the Irish people. They admitted the truth of
</p>
<p>" my assertion, and they neither attempted to conquer nor delude us.
</p>
<p>" No; they left us to work out the national question of Ireland's
</p>
<p>" hope and redemption. All that is required of us is to work it in
</p>
<p>" such a way, as that there will be no destruction of its parts, but
</p>
<p>" that all may arrive securely at the point we wish. My first anxiety
</p>
<p>" is to wrest from the present judicial administration its unholy au-
</p>
<p>" thority, to do away with the wrangling of the petty-sessions courts,
</p>
<p>" where the magistrates preside. I want to have tribunals of recon-
</p>
<p>' ciliation,in every parish in Ireland, existing, not by patent from the
</p>
<p>" Crown, or imbued with Saxon notions of justice, but fair, equitable,
</p>
<p>" and impartial tribunals, where the people may fairly settle their
</p>
<p>" differences by impartial arbitration." He wants to have the tribu-
</p>
<p>nals not existing by patent from the Crown. He then proceeds thus :
</p>
<p>" I implore you to continue your confidence in me. Let it not be by
</p>
<p>" the shout that you will support me. Wait for a moment, and
</p>
<p>" allow me to tell you when the time comes to exert yourselves."
</p>
<p>This was on the 24th of September. On the following day, the 25th,
</p>
<p>an article appeared in the Pilot newspaper, headed " The Army, the
</p>
<p>People, and the Government" A subject which was very important
</p>
<p>for the consideration of those who had determined to redress them-
</p>
<p>selves without the aid or concurrence of the Parliament. It was as
</p>
<p>follows : " No subject can be at present more vitally interesting to
</p>
<p>" the friends of constitutional freedom and Ireland, than the state of
</p>
<p>" the people's army. Aye, the people's army ; for we would be glad
</p>
<p>" to know who pay the taxes which support the army, but the people,
</p>
<p>" the poor oppressed people? Who supply the fine young recruits

</p>
<p>" but the people? and for what pretext was the army ever raised, if
</p>
<p>" not for the defence of the people, or their property ; though now,
</p>
<p>" alas, but too many of them have little or no property ? Then again,
</p>
<p>" the army ; by this we mean that respectable body of men the ser-
</p>
<p>" geants and privates, are all from the people. They intermarry with
</p>
<p>" the people ; and if they survive the service, where there is plenty
</p>
<p>" of fighting, hardships, and flogging, but very little promotion, in fact
</p>
<p>" more kicks than halfpence, where we ask must they return once
</p>
<p>" more but to the ranks of the people ? We therefore think that
</p>
<p>" we are amply justified in calling the army the people's army. Eut
</p>
<p>" in this we have not alluded to those persons who were born to
</p>
<p>" command the sergeants and privates. Our readers are aware, that
</p>
<p>" in what is called the English army, there is a custom, established
</p>
<p>" not certainly by the soldiers, by which all the situations of ease
</p>
<p>" and emolument are generally filled by persons belonging to what
</p>
<p>" are called noble families, or, more properly, rich families, by this
</p>
<p>128
</p>
<p>" scheme, boys of fifteen or sixteen, without having left their mo-
</p>
<p>" ther's apron strings, can, on paying a certain sum of money into
</p>
<p>" a certain office, procure what is called a commission, that is
</p>
<p>" power to receive a certain portion of money out of the public
</p>
<p>" taxes. But it is not enough, that the boy who never earned
</p>
<p>" a penny in his life, should get this comparative sinecure, just
</p>
<p>" because he chances to have a rich father, mother, or uncle, who
</p>
<p>" can put down a certain sum of money. No, things do not stop
</p>
<p>" here. The aforesaid boy, brave fellow, can make another bounce
</p>
<p>" over the heads of those veterans, who have grown grey in the ser-
</p>
<p>" vice of their country, by his merely paying another sum of money
</p>
<p>" into the War Office. All this is certainly a d d fine system for
</p>
<p>" those who command, but not so for those who are told to obey, that
</p>
<p>" is, the great body of the army, the sergeants and privates. A system
</p>
<p>" precisely similar to this prevailed in France, previous to what is
</p>
<p>" called the Revolution, that is, a change by which the people were
</p>
<p>" enabled to divide the land amongst each other like brothers, and
</p>
<p>" merit was permitted to rise in every branch of the public service,
</p>
<p>" but particularly in the army. Prior to the French Revolution, no
</p>
<p>" man, however brave or well conducted, could procure any rank
</p>
<p>" above the hopeless position of a private or sergeant, except he
</p>
<p>" belonged to the dronish and unproductive classes calling themselves
</p>
<p>" nobles, but of which we can convey a better idea by the word idlers.
</p>
<p>" How long this state of things is likely to continue in these coun-
</p>
<p>" tries we do not know, but we think we see what Talleyrand called
</p>
<p>" a beginning of the end. Every dog has his day, and God
</p>
<p>" knows the poor sergeants and privates deserve their days. Why
</p>
<p>" not adopt the system of rising from the ranks, which the people
</p>
<p>" adopted in France, when, maddened by oppression, they rose up
</p>
<p>" and knocked their tyrants on the heads? Of course we, the moral
</p>
<p>" instructors of the Irish people, do not recommend the system of
</p>
<p>" rising up and knocking on the head which the French were com-
</p>
<p>" pelled to adopt. Far from it. We are the old friends of peace-
</p>
<p>" able agitation. The Liberator has said, ' he who commits a crime,

</p>
<p>" gives strength to the enemy,' and we believe it is quite sufficient
</p>
<p>" reason for the Irish not to commit a crime, when we tell them
</p>
<p>" that enemy is England. We are pretty sure they are not inclined
</p>
<p>" to strengthen her at any rate. But to come to the point, the
</p>
<p>" state of the army, what the devil are those persons in command
</p>
<p>" about ? Are they blind ? Are they mad ? Will they be warned
</p>
<p>" by us, whom they know well to be their friend ; for if our columns
</p>
<p>" were not open to the poor soldiers, and if our pen was not used
</p>
<p>" as a peace preserver, we really believe there would have been a
</p>
<p> mutiny long since. Yes, persecute the soldier to the utmost,
</p>
<p>" over-drill him in the dog days, withhold his furlough, deprive him
</p>
<p>" of his newspaper, confine him for the slightest fault, march him to
</p>
<p>" the house of God armed and accoutred as if for battle, but leave
</p>
<p>" him the Press open, and he has still some hope. But go farther,
</p>
<p>" deprive him of an honest uncorrupted Press, and you drive him to
</p>
<p>" madness, or perhaps we should say revenge ! Let us look to the
</p>
<p>129
</p>
<p>" state of the 5th Fusileers. Our readers will no doubt remember,
</p>
<p>" the hapless fate of poor M'Manus, who was proved to have dropped
</p>
<p>" down dead from over-drilling. Well, what was the consequence ?
</p>
<p>" A fine young man of unimpeachable character, an Englishman and
</p>
<p>" a Protestant, named George Jubee, stepped out of the ranks, and
</p>
<p>" drilled a hole in through the body of the Adjutant, one Robertson
</p>
<p>" Mackay, an infamous Scotch tyrant. Thus was the driller drilled.
</p>
<p>" But this was not all. When an inquest was held on the carcass, it
</p>
<p>" came out that the Colonel of this regiment had received a letter,
</p>
<p>" when the regiment was stationed at Fermoy, threatening him with
</p>
<p>" the punishment of death ; and we suppose the maddened Jubee
</p>
<p>"would have fusileered the Colonel, if he had not wisely left the
</p>
<p>" now dangerous post of over-driller to the care of Sawney Robert-
</p>
<p>" son Mackay." This is the " moral instructor," stating that a young
</p>
<p>man of unimpeachable character stepped out of the ranks, and com-
</p>
<p>mitted a murder by shooting his officer. Thus were the people to effect
</p>
<p>a Revolution, which was to lead, as the moral instructor said, to all
</p>
<p>the people of Ireland dividing the land among themselves like
</p>
<p>brothers. He then goes on : " The soldiers of the 5th appear to be,
</p>
<p>" in their political principles, decided repealers. Not physical force
</p>
<p>" repealers, for if they were so, having plenty of arms and ammunition,
</p>
<p>" they could easily appeal to that open violence. This physical force,
</p>
<p>" or armed violence, was what the government had the silliness to
</p>
<p>" threaten the Libeiator and his millions with! But for some cause
</p>
<p>" best known to themselves i\\ey forgot to execute their threat. When
</p>
<p>" a detachment of the 5th left Loughrea, some weeks ago, the repeal-
</p>
<p>" ers with their Temperance bands, accompanied that detachment for
</p>
<p>" above two miles out of town, and on taking their last sorrowful fare-
</p>
<p>" well, the soldiers are stated to have taken off their caps, and given
</p>
<p>" three cheers for Repeal. Thus the country appears never to have
</p>
<p>" been so safe, as the people and the army are on the best terms. This
</p>
<p>" is exactly what a popular government would desire. But certain spy-
</p>
<p>" employing monsters would seem to wish to tamper with the army,
</p>
<p>" and to instigate it to fall on the unoffending people, men, women,

</p>
<p>" and children. But those untried and unimpeached villains would
</p>
<p>" do well to first consider the feelings of the army. An army
</p>
<p>" has often proved a two-edged weapon, wddch is liable to wound
</p>
<p>" the hand that wields it. Thank God, we have however lived
</p>
<p>" to see the army morally reformed, so far as soldiers are con-
</p>
<p>" cerned. We therefore would wish to see promotion from the
</p>
<p>" ranks general, and flogging, or back-mangling, totally abolished.
</p>
<p>" Let a soldier be shot, but not flogged. The soldiers are now as
</p>
<p>" decent, sober, orderly a body of men as any in society. They are
</p>
<p>" patient too, and heaven knows they require to be so. Many of
</p>
<p>" them are teetotalers. They mind their religion, and if not pre-
</p>
<p>" vented by their money-promoted commanders, would improve
</p>
<p>" their minds by reading the newspapers, which, we think, after ful-
</p>
<p>" filling their duties, including over-drilling, that they have just as
</p>
<p>" much right to do as those parties called officers, for an officer oxight
</p>
<p>"properly to mean a promoted soldier, and a soldier an unpro-
</p>
<p>s
</p>
<p>130
</p>
<p>" moted officer. While we are on this important subject, we feel
</p>
<p>" it to be our duty to again direct the people, and the persons who
</p>
<p>" temporarily occupy the places of profit, called Government, to the
</p>
<p>" admirable military letters of John Cornelius O'Callaghan, author of
</p>
<p>" the Green Book. These letters settle for ever the question of
</p>
<p>" the army, that source of England's weakness. These letters first
</p>
<p>" let the cat out of the bag. They teach the soldier his importance,
</p>
<p>" showing him that he is an accountable being, not, what certain
</p>
<p>" traitors would make him, an unconditional murderer. They teach
</p>
<p>" Ireland her strength, and also teach England her's, which the
</p>
<p>" whole world now admits to consist of Irish soldiers and sailors.
</p>
<p>" Ireland is England's right arm, so say the English themselves, and
</p>
<p>" so say we all of us. Take away the right arm, and what a way
</p>
<p>" she'd be in, and what a figure she'd cut. With O'Callaghan's
</p>
<p>" letters in one hand, and his Green Book in the other, we set at
</p>
<p>" defiance the conspirators who would dare talk of warring against
</p>
<p>" the Irish nation ; the best, the most loyal subjects the Queen has.
</p>
<p>" To the patriotic author an eternal debt of gratitude is due by his
</p>
<p>" countrymen. He first directed the public attention to the army,
</p>
<p>" showing up its component parts, and revealing the astounding fact
</p>
<p>" of forty-two thousand Paddies, serving in the pay of England.
</p>
<p>" We do not wonder that he has been called the soldier's friend.
</p>
<p>" 'Tis a proud title, and we know no man now living, better de-
</p>
<p>" serving of that name. To conclude, for our parts, we agree with
</p>
<p>" O'Callaghan's golden maxim, to never cease advocating the cause
</p>
<p>" of the poor, whether they be peasants in the field, or sol-
</p>
<p>" diers in the ranks, whether they be tyrannised over by the exter-
</p>
<p>" minating agent, or the over-drilling martinet." These publications
</p>
<p>were to be circulated among the army, and I ask you the object
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett had in view, when he wished to have them so circulated.
</p>
<p>There is another publication in the same paper, of such a cha-
</p>
<p>racter, that I think it necessary to refer to it. It is an article
</p>
<p>headed : " Rumoured death of General Jackson. The battle of
</p>
<p>New Orleans." After some observations with respect to him,

<p>and his exploits during the American war, we find the following
</p>
<p>commentary by Mr. Barrett : " Why do we recall these things
</p>
<p>" now ? We will confess that we have more reasons than one for
</p>
<p>" doing so. The first is, that the deeds of our illustrious country-
</p>
<p>" man, as in the funeral oration of Mirabeau over Franklin, should
</p>
<p>u be recounted at his death. The second is, a desire we have to
</p>
<p>" point out to Irishmen, aye, and to Englishmen too, that although
</p>
<p>" he exhibited such generalship at New Orleans, he was only a
</p>
<p>"lawyer, not having servecT his apprenticeship as a hireling to the
</p>
<p>u committing of murder, like Wellington ; and our third reason is,
</p>
<p>" an anxiety on our part to cram the falsehood down the throat of
</p>
<p>" the editor of the Times, who, for the purpose of slandering Presi-
</p>
<p>" dent Tyler, in consequence of the part taken on behalf of Ireland,
</p>
<p>" by his brilliant son," (that is the man, who, I have already stated,
</p>
<p>said, "the libation to Ireland's freedom must be quaffed in blood"),
</p>
<p>" eulogises, in his last publication, General Jackson." He then goes
</p>
<p>131
</p>
<p>on: " Before we proceed to deal with the latter branch of the subject,
</p>
<p>" we cannot help remarking again, by way of warning, to those who
</p>
<p>" threaten us with aggression, that Jackson was only a lawyer.
</p>
<p>" O'Connell is one too ! The former surprised the British by at-
</p>
<p>" tacking them twice in the night ; so might the latter, were he
</p>
<p>" driven to it, especially as darkness equalises undisciplined with dis-
</p>
<p>" ciplined men, throwing the advantage, if any, in favour of the for-
</p>
<p>" mer ; the pike being, from the distinctive peculiarity of its shape,
</p>
<p>" the weapon best adapted for night. We do not mention these things
</p>
<p>11 because we are anxious for an outbreak, but because we wish to
</p>
<p>" prevent it. The best way to preserve peace is to show that we
</p>
<p>" are prepared for war ; for even bulls, when they find that they are
</p>
<p>" equally matched, have the sagacity to be civil to, and shy of each
</p>
<p>" other." This article contains many other observations, but what I
</p>
<p>have read will be sufficient justification for my observations, as to
</p>
<p>this moral instructor of the people; but I will not endeavour to
</p>
<p>take from the force of the language of this moral instructor, by
</p>
<p>commenting any further upon it.
</p>
<p>On the 27th and 28th of September, meetings were held at the
</p>
<p>Association, at which Mr. O'Connell, Mr. John O'Connell, Mr.
</p>
<p>Ray, Mr. Steele, and Dr. Gray were present. On the 27th, the
</p>
<p>form of the arbitration deed and the proclamation were submitted
</p>
<p>to the Association. The proclamation was headed by a harp and
</p>
<p>crown, and from its form you will not be surprised that Mr. Duffy
</p>
<p>said, they had assumed all the forms of government ; it runs thus: 
</p>
<p>" Whereas there has been formed for the district of , a court of
</p>
<p>" arbitration ; Mr , the secretary, will furnish, free of expense,
</p>
<p>" the necessary forms, and give such information as may be neces-
</p>
<p>' sary for the legal commencement of arbitration suits:  signed by
</p>
<p>" order, T. M. Ray, Secretary." That was the system sought to be
</p>
<p>established, which was to supersede, not only the petty sessions
</p>
<p>courts, but the proceedings of every court in Ireland, exercising a
</p>
<p>jurisdiction under a patent from the Crown.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I have now arrived at an important date in those

</p>
<p>transactions, the 1st of October. It was on that day that the meet-
</p>
<p>ing was held at the Rath of Mullaghmast. Mr. O'Connell stated at
</p>
<p>the dinner that succeeded that meeting, that there was one million
</p>
<p>of persons present ; the lowest calculation was, I believe, 250,000.
</p>
<p>At that meeting there were present, Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Steele, Mr.
</p>
<p>Barrett, Mr. Ray, and Dr. Gray. The Rath of Mullaghmast was
</p>
<p>selected for this multitudinous meeting, for this reason, as stated by
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell: " I choose this place for the meeting, because it was
</p>
<p>" the precise spot on which English treachery and false Irish trea-
</p>
<p>" chery consummated a massacre unequalled in the history of the
</p>
<p>" world, until the massacre of the Mamelukes by Mehemet Ali."
</p>
<p>Such was the reason assigned by Mr. O'Connell himself, for select-
</p>
<p>ing that place. I suppose it will be said, that those who selected
</p>
<p>this spot for assemblage, had not combined to excite hostility be-
</p>
<p>tween different classes of her Majesty's subjects ; who was the
</p>
<p>Saxon foe, and the Saxon foreigner who were engaged in this mas-
</p>
<p>132
</p>
<p>sacre ? This spot was selected with a view of influencing the peo-
</p>
<p>ple, who if left alone and not misguided, misled, and misinformed,
</p>
<p>would be obedient to the laws. Thus by selecting this spot the
</p>
<p>provocations of centuries past were raked up, the sufferings of our
</p>
<p>ancestors were brought into view for the purpose of exciting
</p>
<p>hostility between fellow. subjects of the British empire. At that
</p>
<p>meeting a document was handed about by a person who said it
</p>
<p>had been printed expressly for all the well wishers of their country,
</p>
<p>by the desire of Mr. O'Connell, and groups of the country people
</p>
<p>were observed in different parts of the field listening to the persons
</p>
<p>who were reading that paper to them. Under the apprehension that
</p>
<p>the language used on the platform would not reach all the parties,
</p>
<p>the course was adopted of printing and circulating a document of this
</p>
<p>inflamatory nature. It was headed, " A full and true account of the
</p>
<p>dreadful slaughter and murder at Mullaghmast, of a body of 400 Ro-
</p>
<p>man Catholics." I will not trouble you by reading this document at
</p>
<p>full length, but I shall quote a few passages from it, in order that you
</p>
<p>may understand its nature ; it said : " The chief men of the septs of
</p>
<p>" O'More and Offally were invited by the Earl of Sussex to a friendly
</p>
<p>" conference at the Kath of Mullaghmast. All the leading men of
</p>
<p>" talent and courage of the tribe, to the amount of 400, rode into the
</p>
<p>" fatal Rath. They perceived too late how perfidiously they had
</p>
<p>" been dealt with ; they found themselves surrounded by a triple
</p>
<p>" line of horse and foot, and at a given signal these fell upon the un-
</p>
<p>" armed and defenceless gentlemen, and murdered them all on the
</p>
<p>" spot." The paragraph concluded with attributing such treachery
</p>
<p>as a common feature in the policy of England. " Did she not always
</p>
<p>" act thus ? Has she not ever thus used those who sued to her for
</p>
<p>" mercy  has she not always betrayed those who confided in her ho-
</p>
<p>" nour ? Is she changed ?  No! Consistent in villany, she is doing
</p>
<p>" now in India what she formerly perpetrated in this country, and so
</p>
<p>" she might do again if Irishmen were cowardly and foolish enough
</p>
<p>" to give her the opportunity ! To be warned against her treachery
</p>
<p>" let a picture of the massacre of Mullaghmast be placed in every

</p>
<p>" house in the country, that we may be guarded against such murder
</p>
<p>" and atrocity, by which, much more than by her valour, England
</p>
<p>*' had always obtained dominion." I shall not trouble you with a
</p>
<p>statement of the various ballads and placards of a seditious character
</p>
<p>that were circulated among the people, for the purpose of exciting
</p>
<p>them, in consequence of the impossibility of such an immense multi-
</p>
<p>tude hearing every thing that passed on the platform. Those ballads
</p>
<p>and placards were printed by a man of the name of Hanly, residing
</p>
<p>Fishamble-street, which was the general printing office for all sedi-
</p>
<p>tious publications throughout Ireland. Amongst the flags at that
</p>
<p>meeting, there were several upon which were inscriptions, Remember
</p>
<p>Mullaghmast ; ihaX meant, remember the place where, according to
</p>
<p>the statement of Mr. O'Connell, a massacre was perpetrated by the
</p>
<p>Saxons worse than that by Mehemet Ali. On others were, Ireland
</p>
<p>for the Irish and the Irish for Ireland. On another, A population
</p>
<p>offline millions is too great to be dragged at the tail of another i\a-
</p>
<p>133
</p>
<p>tion. On another, Ireland must he a Nation. On another, Repeal.
</p>
<p>On another, No Saxon threats, no Irish slaves. No compromise but
</p>
<p>Repeal. At this meeting there were men with labels of O'Con-
</p>
<p>neWs police round their hats, who did duty by the platform, and
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell said he was glad to see them do their duty so well,
</p>
<p>hoping at the same time, that he will soon have no other police in
</p>
<p>Ireland. Mr. O'Connell arrived at the platform at Mullaghmast
</p>
<p>about two o'clock. It may seem an unimportant circumstance per-
</p>
<p>haps, but you may not hereafter have reason to think it so, that he
</p>
<p>came arrayed in his scarlet robes. Many matters may seem trifling
</p>
<p>when merely stated, which were intended to have, and had an impor-
</p>
<p>tant effect ; however little they might have on the higher order of so-
</p>
<p>ciety, yet this is not the case with such masses as those which com-
</p>
<p>posed this meeting. Mr. O'Connell went to that meeting arrayed in
</p>
<p>his scarlet robes, and an incident occurred on the platform which
</p>
<p>may also strike you as trifling, but which might also have a powerful
</p>
<p>effect on such a multitude. A cap was presented to Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>on the platform, which, according to the statement of one of the de-
</p>
<p>fendants, was embroidered, and ornamented with gold, and corres-
</p>
<p>ponding in form with the ancient Irish crown preserved in the Irish
</p>
<p>Museum. Such was the description of it given by Mr. Barrett. To
</p>
<p>this too, some ridicule might be attached, but it was not thought ridi-
</p>
<p>culous by the people met there that day. Whatever colour of ridi-
</p>
<p>cule might be given to it now, it did produce a great effect on the
</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands then assembled. It was placed on the head of
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell amid great cheering from the people. On them the
</p>
<p>effect was not intended to be ridiculous: on educated persons it might
</p>
<p>have no effect, but not so on those who surrounded the platform.
</p>
<p>Though all that was spoken could not be heard from the platform,
</p>
<p>yet all that was done there could be seen by every human being in
</p>
<p>the meeting. Mr. O'Connell having arrived at the platform, ad-
</p>
<p>dressed the meeting; he was in the chair, and having thanked them
</p>
<p>for the honour done him, said : " I feel more honoured than ever I
</p>
<p>" did in my life, with the single exception of the day I attended a

</p>
<p>" meeting, if possible more majestic, at Tara. But if a comparison
</p>
<p>" were instituted, it would take a more discriminating eye than mine
</p>
<p>" to perceive any difference between them. They exhibited the same
</p>
<p>" determination, the same firmness, the same resolution not to vio-
</p>
<p>" late the peace. They were not guilty of the slightest outrage ;
</p>
<p>" they would not give the enemy any power by committing a crime.
</p>
<p>" But they peacefully and manfully stood together in the open day
</p>
<p>" to protest before man, and in the presence of God, against the ini-
</p>
<p>" quity of the Union. At Tara I protested against the Union, to-
</p>
<p>" day I repeat the protest at Mullaghmast. I declare solemnly my
</p>
<p>" thorough conviction, as a constitutional lawyer, that the Union is
</p>
<p>" totally void in point of principle and constitutional force. I tell
</p>
<p>" you that no portion of the empire has the power of trampling on
</p>
<p>" the rights and liberties of the Irish people. The Irish Parliament
</p>
<p>" was instituted to make laws and not legislatures. It was institu-
</p>
<p>" ted under the constitution and not to annihilate it ; their dele-
</p>
<p>134
</p>
<p>" gation from the people was confined within the limits of the con-
</p>
<p>" stitution, and the moment Parliament went beyond and destroyed
</p>
<p>" the constitution, that instant it annihilated its own powers, but it
</p>
<p>" could not annihilate the immortal spirit of liberty which belonged
</p>
<p>" as a rightful inheritance to the people of Ireland, and take it then
</p>
<p>" from me that the Union is void." This was addressed to a multi-
</p>
<p>tude consisting of from 250,000 to 1,000,000 of persons, and is in
</p>
<p>accordance with the statement made, that the Crown had the right
</p>
<p>of summoning an Irish Parliament, and was consistent with the opi-
</p>
<p>nion that the Act of Union was void. He further stated : " I admit
</p>
<p>" that the Union has the force of law, because it is supported by the
</p>
<p>" policeman's truncheon, the soldier's bayonet and sword, and the
</p>
<p>" courts of law ; but I solemnly declare, that it is not in the spirit of
</p>
<p>" the constitution and is therefore void. I have physical force
</p>
<p> enough about me to-day to achieve any thing, but you know full
</p>
<p>" well it is not my plan. I will not risk one of you  I could not af-
</p>
<p>" ford to lose any of you. I will protect you all  I will obtain for you
</p>
<p>" all the repeal of the Union. There is not a man of you there, if
</p>
<p>" we were attacked unjustly  illegally attacked, who would not be
</p>
<p>" ready to stand in the open field by my side. Let every man who
</p>
<p>" concurs in that sentiment lift up his hand. [An immense number
</p>
<p>" were displayed.] The assertion of that sentiment is our safe pro-
</p>
<p>" tection, for nobody will attack us, and we will attack nobody. In-
</p>
<p>" deed it would be the height of absurdity in us to think of making
</p>
<p>" an attack when we can play the game peaceably and quietly. There
</p>
<p>" is not a man in his senses in Europe or America, that does not ad-
</p>
<p>" mit the repeal of the Union is now inevitable. The English news-
</p>
<p>" papers taunted us, and their writers, who first laughed us to scorn,
</p>
<p>" now admit that it is impossible to resist the application for Repeal.
</p>
<p>" I thought the monster meetings had demonstrated the opinion of Ire-
</p>
<p>'' land. I was convinced that their unanimous determination to obtain
</p>
<p>" liberty, was sufficiently signified by the many meetings that already
</p>
<p>" took place; but when the Queen's minister's speech came out, I
</p>
<p>" saw it was necessary to do something more. Accordingly I called

</p>
<p>"a meeting at Loughrea  a monster meeting; we called another
</p>
<p>" meeting at Clifden  a monster meeting ; we called another meeting
</p>
<p>" at Lismore  a monster meeting ; and here we are now, upon the
</p>
<p>" Rath of Mullaghmast. I choose it for an obvious reason. We are
</p>
<p>" upon the precise spot in which English treachery, aye, and false
</p>
<p>" Irish treachery too, consummated a massacre, unequalled in the
</p>
<p>" crimes of the world, until the massacre of the Mamelukes by Me-
</p>
<p>" hemet Ali. It was necessary to have Turks to commit a crime, in
</p>
<p>" order to be equal to the crime of the English ; no other people but
</p>
<p>" Turks were wicked enough, except the English." Thus tracing back
</p>
<p>transactions which occurred centuries before,  grievances which may
</p>
<p>have existed then, with a view to excite them to hostility to England.
</p>
<p>In another part of the same speech he says : " I thought this a fit
</p>
<p>" and becoming spot to celebrate our unanimity in declaring in the
</p>
<p>" open day, our determination not to be misled by any treachery.
</p>
<p>" Oh! my friends, I will keep you clear of all treachery. There
</p>
<p>135
</p>
<p>" shall be no bargains, no compromise; nothing but the repeal, and
</p>
<p>" a Parliament of our own. You will never, by my advice, confide
</p>
<p>" in any false hopes they hold out ; you will confide in nothing until
</p>
<p>" you hear me say, 1 am satisfied, and 1 will tell you where I shall
</p>
<p>" say that  near the statue of King William, in College-green. No,
</p>
<p>" we came here to express our determination to die to a man, if ne-
</p>
<p>" cessary ; but we came to take advice of each other ; and above all,
</p>
<p>" you came here to take my advice. 1 have the game in my hands,
</p>
<p>" I have the triumph secure. I have the repeal certain if you obey
</p>
<p>" my advice. I will go slow ; yon must allow me to do it ; but I will
</p>
<p>" go sure. No man shall be fined, no man shall be imprisoned, no man
</p>
<p>" shall be prosecuted who takes my advice. 1 have led you thus far
</p>
<p>" in safety ; I have stilled the multitude of repealers, till they are so
</p>
<p>" far identified with the entire population of the soil, or nearly so.
</p>
<p>" I have seven-eighths of the population of Ireland enrolling them-
</p>
<p>" selves as Associates [cries of ' more power to you']. I do not want
</p>
<p>" more power, I have power enough. All I ask of you is, to allow
</p>
<p>" me to use it. I will go on quietly and slowly. I am arranging
</p>
<p>" the plan of a new Irish House of Commons. It is a theory, but it
</p>
<p>" is a theory that may be realized in three weeks. The Arbitrators
</p>
<p>" are beginning to sit ; the people are submitting their differences to
</p>
<p>" men chosen by themselves. You will see by the newspapers that
</p>
<p>" Dr. Gray and my son, and other gentlemen, hold a petty sessions
</p>
<p>" of their own, in the room of the magistrates who have been un-
</p>
<p>" justly deprived. We will submit all our differences to them, and
</p>
<p>" will endeavour to do justice to all parties, and it will not cost you
</p>
<p>" a single farthing. I shall go on with that plan until I have all dis-
</p>
<p>" putes decided by judges appointed by the people themselves. I
</p>
<p>" wish to live long enough to see justice realised to Ireland, and li-
</p>
<p>" berty proclaimed throughout the land. It will take me some time
</p>
<p>" to arrange the state of the new Irish House of Commons ; that
</p>
<p>" plan which will be submitted one day to her Majesty, when she has
</p>
<p>" got rid of the present miserable and paltry administration, and has
</p>
<p>" an administration that I can support, constituted of friends of Ire-

<p>" land; we will then have a Parliament; but I must finish that part
</p>
<p>" of the job before I go further ; and one of the reasons for calling
</p>
<p>" you together was, to proclaim througout Ireland, that 1 want to
</p>
<p>" arrange that before I go a step further. The Conciliation Hall
</p>
<p>" will soon be finished in Dublin, and it will be worth any man's
</p>
<p>" while to go from Mullaghmast to Dublin, to see what a beautiful
</p>
<p>" hall it will be. When I have that arranged, I will call together
</p>
<p>" 300, as the Times newspaper calls them, bog-trotters, but better men
</p>
<p>" never stepped upon pavement. I will have 300, and no thanks to
</p>
<p>" them. I have but one wish for the liberty and prosperity of the
</p>
<p>" people of Ireland. Let the English have England, let the Scotch
</p>
<p>" have Scotland, but we must have Ireland for the Irish. I will not
</p>
<p>" be content until I see not a single man in any office, from the low-
</p>
<p>" est constable to the Lord Chancellor, but Irishmen ; this is our
</p>
<p>u land, and we must have it. We will be obedient to the Queen,
</p>
<p>"joined to England by the golden link of the Crown, but we must
</p>
<p>136
</p>
<p>11 have our own Parliament, our own Bench, our own magistrates,
</p>
<p>" and we will make some of the shoneens now upon it leave it. If
</p>
<p>" there be any man in favour of the Union let him say so [cries of
</p>
<p>" ' not one'J. I never mistook you. Yes, my friends, the Union was
</p>
<p>" begot in iniquity, it was perpetrated in fraud and cruelty, it was no
</p>
<p>" compact, no bargain ; it was an act of the most decided tyranny
</p>
<p>" and corruption that ever was perpetrated. The trial by jury was
</p>
<p>" suspended ; the right of personal protection was at an end ; courts
</p>
<p>" martial sat ; and the county of Kildare, amongst other counties,
</p>
<p>" was filled with blood. Oh! my friends, listen to the man of peace,
</p>
<p>" who will not expose you to your enemies. In 1798, there were
</p>
<p>" brave men at the head of the people at large, there were some
</p>
<p>" valiant men, but there were many traitors who left the people ex-
</p>
<p>" posed to the swords of the enemy. On the Curragh of Kildare,
</p>
<p>"you confided your military power to your relations; they were
</p>
<p>" basely betrayed and trampled under foot ; it was ill-organized, a
</p>
<p>" premature, a foolish, an absurd insurrection ; but you have a
</p>
<p>" leader now who will never allow you to be led astray. Even your
</p>
<p>" enemies admit, that the world has not produced any man that can
</p>
<p>" exceed the Irishman in activity and in strength. The Scotch
</p>
<p>" philosopher and the French philosopher have confirmed it, that
</p>
<p>" number one in the human race is (blessed be heaven) the Irish.
</p>
<p>" In moral virtue, in religious perseverance, in glorious temperance ;
</p>
<p>" have I any teetotalers here ? [cries of ' yes']. Yes, it is teetotalism
</p>
<p>" that is repealing the Union. I could not afford to bring you to-
</p>
<p>" gether, I would not dare to do it, if I had not teetotalers for my
</p>
<p>" police, [cries of' we are all police']. To be sure you are, without
</p>
<p>" paying, and you will soon be the only police by the help of
</p>
<p>" God. Oh ! my friends, it is a country worth fighting for ; it is a
</p>
<p>" country worth dying for ; but above all, it is a country worth
</p>
<p>" being tranquil, determined, submissive, and docile for, dis-
</p>
<p>" ciplined as you are in obedience to those who are breaking the
</p>
<p>" way, and trampling down the barriers between you and your con-
</p>
<p>" stitutional liberty." Gentlemen, at this meeting was proposed

<p>and carried, what has been called the Leinster declaration. This
</p>
<p>meeting was in fact a provincial meeting for Leinster, and conse-
</p>
<p>quently, these resolutions raised the name of the Leinster declaration
</p>
<p>for repeal. The first of these resolutions was as follows : " Resolved,
</p>
<p>" That this meeting hereby declare its devoted loyalty to the per-
</p>
<p>" son and throne of her gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, Queen of
</p>
<p>" Ireland, and its determination to uphold and maintain inviolate all
</p>
<p>" the prerogatives of the Crown as guaranteed by the constitution."
</p>
<p>" Resolved, That we, the clergy, gentry, freeholders, burgesses,
</p>
<p>" and other inhabitants of the province of Leinster, in public meeting
</p>
<p>" assembled, declare and pronounce in the presence of our country,
</p>
<p>" before Europe and America, and in the sight of Heaven, that no
</p>
<p>" power on earth ought of right to make laws to bind this kingdom,
</p>
<p>" save the Queen, Lords, and Commons of Ireland ; and here, stand-
</p>
<p>" ing on the graves of the martyred dead, we solemnly pledge our-
</p>
<p>" selves to use every constitutional exertion to free this our native
</p>
<p>137
</p>
<p>" land from the tyranny of being legislated for by others than her
</p>
<p>** own inhabitants." The martyred dead there meant the 400 Roman
</p>
<p>Catholics who were massacred by what, were termed the Saxon
</p>
<p>foreigners, whose acts could not be exceeded in brutality by any
</p>
<p>people in the world, except the Turks. The next resolution was as
</p>
<p>follows : " Resolved, That forty-four years of devoted and successful
</p>
<p>" labour in the cause of his country have justly earned for O'Connell,
</p>
<p>" the liherator of Ireland, the unbounded confidence of the Irish
</p>
<p>" people ; and that we, relying upon his supreme wisdom, discretion,
</p>
<p>" patriotism, and undaunted firmness, hereby pledge ourselves, in-
</p>
<p>" dividually and collectively, to follow his guidance under any and
</p>
<p>" every circumstance that may arise, and, come weal or woe, never
</p>
<p>" to desert the constitutional standard of Repeal which he has
</p>
<p>" raised." There was also a concluding resolution for a petition to
</p>
<p>parliament for a repeal of the Union, to be intrusted for presenta-
</p>
<p>tion to a Repeal member. This meeting having been held after
</p>
<p>the prorogation of parliament, I am not at liberty to apply to it what
</p>
<p>I applied to the others, namely, the fact of no petition having been
</p>
<p>presented to the House of Commons from it, but when you are con-
</p>
<p>sidering under what pretext those meetings assembled, and that at
</p>
<p>none of them was any petition prepared, you will judge whether the
</p>
<p>resolution passed at this meeting, was not to give a colour of legality to
</p>
<p>it, when by the address on the 13th of September, it had been resolved
</p>
<p>unanimously, that there was no hope from Parliament. In The King
</p>
<p>v. Redhead, to which I have already referred, a verdict was had
</p>
<p>against the traversers, although at the meeting which was arraigned,
</p>
<p>a resolution was adopted to present a petition to Parliament ; that
</p>
<p>therefore does not test the legality of the meeting, and you are to
</p>
<p>judge whether this meeting of half a million of persons, at which
</p>
<p>the resolutions which I have read were passed, was held for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of overawing the legislature, by the demonstration of physical
</p>
<p>force, and the apprehension of ulterior consequences, or for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of petitioning Parliament.
</p>
<p>On the same day a dinner took place, in a pavilion erected on

</p>
<p>the Rath of Mullaghmast. Always bear in mind the statement in
</p>
<p>the document which I read to you, that it was on that Rath that the
</p>
<p>Irish Catholics had been massacred, you will thus be better able to
</p>
<p>understand why one of the banners or emblems used on the occasion,
</p>
<p>contained an Irish harp, without a crown, and the Irish wolf-dog,
</p>
<p>with the inscription  No more shall Saxon butchery give blood-gouts
</p>
<p>for our repast. The dog is watching, he is roused, and treachery
</p>
<p>expelled from Mullaghmast. On another banner was the motto,
</p>
<p>Mullaghmast and its martyrs  a voice from the grave. At that
</p>
<p>dinner Mr. O'Connell, Mr. John O'Connell, Mr. Ray, Mr. Steele,
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett, and Dr. Gray were present, six of the traversers. Mr.
</p>
<p>John O'Connell was in the chair at that dinner, and in proposing the
</p>
<p>first toast, he said : " I do not, because I cannot anticipate that in
</p>
<p>" any phase of circumstances the toast I have now to give will be re-
</p>
<p>" ceived otherwise than well by Irishmen ; it is the health of the
</p>
<p>" Queen. Whatever may happen, her throne in Ireland is secure.
</p>
<p>T
</p>
<p>138
</p>
<p>" When, the other day, we distinguished between the vain and bab-
</p>
<p>" bling words that were put into her mouth, we distinguished well
</p>
<p>" between the monarch and the ministers, and we would make the
</p>
<p>" same distinction as clearly, and as well, were bloody deeds and hard
</p>
<p>" blows to be attempted. Her ministers may fix her throne amidst
</p>
<p>" bloody fields, and blazing cities, and slaughtered corpses, let them
</p>
<p>" take care that the ruddiest stream flowing might not be their own
</p>
<p>" blood, and the brightest and fiercest flame might not be from the
</p>
<p>" strongholds from which they now insult the Irish people. What-
</p>
<p>" ever they do, whatever they threaten, we will go on ; and so sure
</p>
<p>" as there is a heaven above us, we will establish her throne here,
</p>
<p>" among a peaceful, a happy, and a contented people. The Queen,
</p>
<p>" God bless her." At the dinner, Dr. Gray read a letter, dated
</p>
<p>26th September, 1843, and signed Thomas Ffrench, in which the
</p>
<p>following appeared : " This mighty movement, unprecedented in
</p>
<p>" the history of nations, has now assumed a magnitude much too
</p>
<p>" immense to admit of retrograde or compromise. It has, in fact,
</p>
<p>" terrified the foes, as much as it has delighted the friends of Ire-
</p>
<p>" land. Some step must and will be taken. Menaces have been
</p>
<p>" tried, with signal discomfiture. Overtures of peace will doubtless
</p>
<p>" be now experimented ; promises of conciliation and pledges as to
</p>
<p>" the removal of grievances. Can these be now accepted? I an-
</p>
<p>" swer, never, never ! The hour of delusion is past. The scene
</p>
<p>" upon which will be collected the flower of Lagenian patriotism ;
</p>
<p>" the Rath of Mullaghmast  the monument of Celtic confiding
</p>
<p>" valour, and Saxon cowardice and treachery, will not, I am sure, be
</p>
<p>" ineffectual in imparting to the vast assembly, an instructive lesson,
</p>
<p>" as to the paramount necessity of cautious counsel in future. Why
</p>
<p>" should Putrica fides so long usurp the dignity of the adage in clas-
</p>
<p>" sic pages ? Let it at once yield to Br itannica fides, a more apt and
</p>
<p>" pregnant designation. A cursory glance over the annals of Ireland
</p>
<p>" is sufficient to demonstrate, that the history of British connexion
</p>
<p>" with this county furnishes instances of Saxon perfidy, exceeding
</p>
<p>" in numbers and magnitude, an} r in the history of Carthage, or

</p>
<p>" even in the universal history of the world." Mr. Barrett made a
</p>
<p>speech at that dinner, in which, among other observations, were the
</p>
<p>following : " It has been said, that as we visited the Hill of Tara, to
</p>
<p>" recall the virtuous and glorious days of Irishmen, in order to
</p>
<p>" awaken the sentiments by which we may be restored to indepen-
</p>
<p>" dence ; so we visit the Rath of Mullaghmast to-day, to recollect the
</p>
<p>" treachery by which Ireland was betrayed ; and to prevent (as one
</p>
<p>" of these letters said) the credulity which would again expose this
</p>
<p>" oppressed country to Saxon turpitude." In the course of the
</p>
<p>dinner, Mr. O'Connell, in speaking to the toast of the " Repeal
</p>
<p>of the Union,'' said amongst other remarks, " Peel was valiant for
</p>
<p>" the hour, and Wellington said there was nothing for it but war ;
</p>
<p>" but they saw we do not want to go to war with them. They
</p>
<p>" therefore brought out the Queen against us ; dear lady, I have
</p>
<p>" the greatest respect for her, but I know the words were not her's,
</p>
<p>139
</p>
<p>" but I take her speech, and that very speech is the reason we are
</p>
<p>" here this very evening for Ireland ; we have made these demon-
</p>
<p>" strations before hundreds of thousands of fighting men ; one would
</p>
<p>" think you had a taste for fighting. We have met, and we have
</p>
<p>" proclaimed by our meeting the national determination for the
</p>
<p>" regeneration of the country. Yes, it would have been enough to
</p>
<p>" have exhibited the national will in the meetings that preceded that
</p>
<p>" speech, but it became necessary to show that there was nothing in
</p>
<p>" the ministerial speech, though put into the mouth of the Sovereign,
</p>
<p>" that could deter resolute and rational men from the pursuit of
</p>
<p>" their liberty. And if instead of one speech she had made one
</p>
<p>" hundred speeches, the effect would have been precisely the same."
</p>
<p>Again he says: "We would not have met at Mullaghmast to-day, if it
</p>
<p>" were not to show the futility and falsehood of the expectation,
</p>
<p>" that it would run out, otherwise this meeting would not have
</p>
<p>" been necessary. A few more ;ve shall now have by way of tilly. I
</p>
<p>" have five or six or seven yet unarranged, these at least we shall
</p>
<p>" have, and I think by that time, the ministry will be tolerably con-
</p>
<p>" vinced, that the do-nothing policy will not heal the sores of
</p>
<p>" of Ireland." Again he says: "I can sleep to-night tranquilly, and
</p>
<p>" perhaps dream of Ireland ; I will awake thinking of the next step
</p>
<p>" in the progress of her freedom, and these steps are not difficult.
</p>
<p>" The administration of the law we want to get out of the hands of
</p>
<p>" the enemy ; the Arbitration Courts are working well, and there are
</p>
<p>" already judges selected by yourselves. Oh ! there is not a rock
</p>
<p>" of any colour, but that where we will have them. I want to show
</p>
<p>" the nations of Europe, that we are capable of administering our
</p>
<p>"judicial business ourselves, that we do not want the Saxon and the
</p>
<p>" stranger, and above all, we do not want bigoted men to serve us
</p>
<p>" to do our business." He then speaks of the difficulty of restraining
</p>
<p>the people at the stage at which they were now arrived ; and I may
</p>
<p>here remind you of this, that Lord Tenterden stated, that persons
</p>
<p>who listened to those speeches evinced more anxiety to proceed
</p>
<p>rapidly, than those who delivered them. Such was the apprehen-

</p>
<p>sion of Mr. O'Connell, as to the result of this organization, which
</p>
<p>you will be told had not been brought about for the purpose
</p>
<p>of any contemplated breach of the law. Again, he says : " I
</p>
<p>" wish that every man should bide his time, and be guided by the
</p>
<p>" counsel of wise men, and the anointed priests of God. I know
</p>
<p>" that you will do so. It is not by accident that to-night we are
</p>
<p>" on the Rath of Mullaghmast ; it was deliberate design ; and yet it
</p>
<p>" is curious what a spot we are assembled on. I anticipated it, and
</p>
<p>'* I now rejoice in it, where my voice is sounding, and you are quiet
</p>
<p>" hearers, attentively listening ; there was once raised the yell of des-
</p>
<p>" pair, the groans of approaching death, the agony of inflicted
</p>
<p>" wounds on the perishing and the unarmed. On this very spot they
</p>
<p>" fell beneath the swords of the Saxon who used them securely, and
</p>
<p>" delightfully grinding their victims to death ; here the Saxon tri-
</p>
<p>" umphed ; here he raised the shout of victory over his unarmed
</p>
<p>11 prey. Upon this very spot, 300 able men perished, who, confiding
</p>
<p>140
</p>
<p>" in Saxon promises, came to a conference of the Queen's subjects,
</p>
<p>" and in the merriment of the banquet they were slaughtered. There
</p>
<p>" nevei* returned home but one. Their wives were widowed, and
</p>
<p>" their children were orphans ; in their homesteads the shriek of des-
</p>
<p>" pair, the father and the husband steeped in their own blood ; their
</p>
<p>" wives and mothers wept over them in vain. Oh ! Saxon cruelty ;
</p>
<p>" how it does delight my heart to think you dare not attempt such
</p>
<p>" a feat again." This was a transaction which took place, or which
</p>
<p>was alleged to have taken place in the reign of Queen Mary, and it
</p>
<p>was referred to for the purpose of exciting hostility in different parts
</p>
<p>of the empire, between the people and the Government ; after an in-
</p>
<p>terval of some hundred years, he sought to excite the people, by
</p>
<p>ransacking the history of his country for centuries past; and yet,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, you will be told by the counsel on behalf of the tra-
</p>
<p>versers, that they are innocent of the charge in the indictment, of
</p>
<p>combination and conspiracy to excite hostility between the people
</p>
<p>and the throne. Dr. Gray spoke at that dinner, and amongst other
</p>
<p>observations he said: " I stand up to return thanks, not on behalf of
</p>
<p>" this or that class, but on behalf of the judges appointed by the
</p>
<p>" people. For the first time the people have judges, for a long time
</p>
<p>" past they have been ruled, and governed, and trampled upon by
</p>
<p>" aliens and enemies; by enemies, who, although living amongst us,
</p>
<p>" were not our friends but our foes who lived among us till they
</p>
<p>" found that which gave them an opportunity for the exercise of
</p>
<p>" their petty malicious tyranny, but now we have persons as our
</p>
<p>" judges, men selected among ourselves, deriving their authority, not
</p>
<p>" from any patent appointments, not from any constituted assembly,
</p>
<p>" but deriving it directly and solely from ourselves." I am not aware
</p>
<p>that any thing further happened at that dinner, to which it is neces-
</p>
<p>sary for me to refer.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, on the 2nd of October, a meeting of the Association
</p>
<p>took place, at which Mr. O'Connell, Mr. John O'Connell, Mr. Hay,
</p>
<p>and Mr. Steele were present. Mr. O'Connell referred to the plan
</p>
<p>of the Queen's issuing writs for an Irish Parliament, to which he had

</p>
<p>frequently referred at prior meetings ; and he made some obser-
</p>
<p>vations at that meeting, with respect to an advertisement, to which
</p>
<p>I shall have to refer.
</p>
<p>On the 3rd of October, another meeting of the Association took
</p>
<p>place ; the persons present were Mr. O'Connell, Mr. John O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell, Mr. Kay, Mr. Steele, Mr. Duffy, Rev. Mr. Tierney, and Dr.
</p>
<p>Gray. That meeting included all the traversers, except Mr. Barrett.
</p>
<p>A letter was read at that meeting, which shows the kind of tyranny
</p>
<p>which they practised, to force persons to join the repeal movement ;
</p>
<p>it is a letter signed by Patrick Skerrett, the Chairman of the Town
</p>
<p>Commisioners of Loughrea, inclosing 14 to the friends of the Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation, and in that letter were stated the names of the subscribers.
</p>
<p>Amongst others were three : one who would send his subscription in
</p>
<p>a few days, and two who were recusants (that is, they exercised a fair
</p>
<p>and unbiassed judgment), whom they (the Board of Commissioners)
</p>
<p>were determined to expel from their body, when a proper opportu-
</p>
<p>141
</p>
<p>nity arrived. Upon this passage in the letter being read, Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell rose up and said : " They are quite right to turn out
</p>
<p>those who are not repealers." This is the freedom of this system.
</p>
<p>It resembles exactly the circumstance which occurred at Tullamore,
</p>
<p>which had been spoken of with such approbation, where a labourer
</p>
<p>was seen in a field, working by himself, his fellow-labourers refusing
</p>
<p>to speak to him, because he had exercised the right of private judg-
</p>
<p>ment. You now have the same system extending to the higher
</p>
<p>classes ; you have the Commissioners, in whom the corporate pro-
</p>
<p>perty is vested by the Corporation Act, sending their subscrip-
</p>
<p>tions to this Association, and stating that they would expel three
</p>
<p>recusants from their board, and Mr. O'Connell expressing his ap-
</p>
<p>probation of this tyranny over the free exercise of private judg-
</p>
<p>ment in a matter of this description. I am sorry to say that many
</p>
<p>persons have been driven to join the repeal movement, by this sys-
</p>
<p>tem of oppression and tyranny. At that meeting, Mr. Steele made
</p>
<p>a speech which will be in substance detailed to you by one of the
</p>
<p>witnesses, who will be produced to prove this case. I cannot avoid
</p>
<p>making some observations here with respect to this. A statement
</p>
<p>has been made that this speech never was made, yet it is somewhat
</p>
<p>singular, if it was not made, it should appear in three newspapers be-
</p>
<p>longing to three of the defendants, and they will have an opportunity
</p>
<p>of examining the reporters of these three newspapers, who reported
</p>
<p>that speech. I ask you now to test this and make this inquiry from
</p>
<p>yourselves, when you will find that, which I venture to anticipate, they
</p>
<p>will not examine the reporters who reported that speech, the persons
</p>
<p>over whom they have control. J should observe with respect to the
</p>
<p>witness, whom we shall produce on behalf of the Crown, and who
</p>
<p>reported this speech at Mullaghmast, if they question the accuracy of
</p>
<p>his report of what took place, they can examine their own reporters who
</p>
<p>published an account of it, and although there may be some trifling
</p>
<p>variation, which will necessarily arise when there are two reports of the
</p>
<p>same proceeding, yet it will be found substantially correct. Their case
</p>
<p>will be to throw discredit upon this witness, as may be seen by the pla-

</p>
<p>cards which have been most discreditably circulated. If he is not stating
</p>
<p>the fact, three of the defendants having reported those proceedings in
</p>
<p>the several newspapers, will have an opportunity of producing their re-
</p>
<p>porters, and getting them to state what will be their defence, that every
</p>
<p>word of his speech was pure imagination, although they have published
</p>
<p>them. But if he be in error in the report, I would as soon take their
</p>
<p>own report, for the purpose of proving the criminality of those pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings, as they will be found just as criminal in their own report of
</p>
<p>the proceedings. I ask you, gentlemen, to put this question to them,
</p>
<p>when they go into their case, and I prophesy they will not produce
</p>
<p>one of those reporters. There was another speech made at this
</p>
<p>meeting, to which, gentlemen, I wish to call your attention. It is a
</p>
<p>speech made by the Rev. Mr. Tierney ; it is as follows : " It is an
</p>
<p>" old story, but is not the less valuable on that account ; that a thing
</p>
<p>' once well begun is more than half finished. Repeal has had a
</p>
<p>* noble beginning this year, and from the glorious progress it is making
</p>
<p>112
</p>
<p>" I ask why do the countless multitudes, who surround the Liberator
</p>
<p>u wherever he goes through the provinces, numberless as the waves
</p>
<p>" of the ocean, assemble, or why do so many of yourselves congre-
</p>
<p>" gate together here around him ? Is it for the purpose of looking
</p>
<p>" at the illustrious individual, to do honour to his presence ; is it
</p>
<p>" to gaze upon the greatest friend of the human race; is it to feast
</p>
<p>" the eye to satiety upon one who is marked out by Divine Provi-
</p>
<p>" dence as the saviour of his country ? No ; though that would be
</p>
<p>"justifiable in you, still you come here for a better and for a holier
</p>
<p>" purpose ; you come here to help him, to assist him in rescu-
</p>
<p>" ing your country from a state of slavery to be a free nation ; you
</p>
<p>" come here to enable him to make your own Ireland, the land
</p>
<p>" of your birth, the land of the happy and the free. And let
</p>
<p>" me ask you are you all prepared to do so ? If you are, give
</p>
<p>" him deeds as well as words. I can answer for the county I have
</p>
<p>" the honour to belong to, Monaghan, and for the parish that I have
</p>
<p>" also the honour to be priest of, that there we are determined
</p>
<p>" to give our hands as well as our hearts ; we are determined to
</p>
<p>" give him acts as well as deeds, and not to leave in his power
</p>
<p>" or in the power of others to say, the people of the north are
</p>
<p>" cold and frozen like the region they inhabit ; the iron is sunk
</p>
<p>" deep into their hearts, they love not liberty ; they deserve to be
</p>
<p>" slaves. Oh, there was a time when the people of the north and
</p>
<p>" the men of Monaghan were found to be the first to resist, and the
</p>
<p>" last to bend to the proud Saxon. There was a time when they did
</p>
<p>" not shun the battle field. Bear me witness ye different streams of the
</p>
<p>" Blackwater ; bear me witness the very parish I have the honour to
</p>
<p>" come from  Clontibret bear me witness, Benburb and the battle of
</p>
<p>" theYellow Ford, in my neighbourhood." That is one of the battles
</p>
<p>mentioned on the Repeal card, in which the Saxons were defeated,
</p>
<p>and the Irish victorious. " These are bright spots in the history of
</p>
<p>" my locality, and, as I am talking of bygone times, permit me to
</p>
<p>" bring to your recollection a few facts connected with the history
</p>
<p>" of my country. In the year 1587, Hugh O'Neill was created

</p>
<p>" Earl of Tyrone. He was then in the 50th year of his age ; he
</p>
<p>"was one of the bravest generals that ever commanded an Irish
</p>
<p>" army. In 1588, Sir William Fitzwilliam was Lord Deputy of
</p>
<p>" Ireland ; he was a bloody and inhuman monster ; he was a foul
</p>
<p>" murderer and a robber. I shall mention to you a robbery and a
</p>
<p>" murder he committed in my county. He had Red Hugh Macmahon,
</p>
<p>" chieftain of Monaghan, arrested on a false charge, and brought to
</p>
<p>" Dublin. He was, however, acquitted, and the Deputy engaged to
</p>
<p>" have him conducted in safety to his own home. On his arrival
</p>
<p>" there, he was seized by the English soldiers, under the command
</p>
<p>" of Sir H. Bagnall ; he was executed at his own door ; his head
</p>
<p>" was struck off, and sent to the Castle of Dublin, and his lands and
</p>
<p>" his estates were divided between the same Sir H. Bagnall, a Cap-
</p>
<p>" tain Ansly, and others of his English murderers." This is a trans-
</p>
<p>action which Mr. Tierney brings forward to excite hostility against
</p>
<p>his fellow-subjects in England. " On account of this frightful and
</p>
<p>143
</p>
<p>" inhuman murder, and many other murders and robberies then of
</p>
<p>" daily occurrence, many of the northern chieftains confederated for
</p>
<p>" their own safety. They raised an army, and gave the principal
</p>
<p>" command to Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone. In the year 1595, he
</p>
<p>" encamped at the town of Monaghan, with the Irish forces under his
</p>
<p>" command. The English were commanded by Sir John Norris, and
</p>
<p>* hisbrother Thomas Norris. Both armies met in my parish, Clontibret.
</p>
<p>" The Irish were separated from the English by marshes and surround-
</p>
<p>" ingbogs of certain townlands. The English being repeatedly beaten
</p>
<p>" and repulsed by the bravery of the Irish and the vigilance of their
</p>
<p>" general made a desperate attack on the Irish lines, led on in per-
</p>
<p>" son by their general, Sir John Norris ; but the general's horse was
</p>
<p>" shot under him, and the general himself, and his brother, Thomas
</p>
<p>" Norris, were both severely wounded and carried off the field. In
</p>
<p>" the meantime the commander of a regiment, of dragoons, of the name
</p>
<p>" of Sedgrave, made a charge on the Irish, and succeeded in gaining
</p>
<p>" the pass ; when he crossed the river, he was met in person by
</p>
<p>" Hugh O'Neill, the commander of the Irish, both rode furiously at
</p>
<p>"each other; Sedgrave, after breaking his spear, jumped off his
</p>
<p>" horse, seized O'Neill by the neck, and dragged him oft' his horse,
</p>
<p>" when the noble earl drew a dagger from his belt, and buried it in
</p>
<p>" the bowels of his adversary, who rolled a lifeless corpse upon
</p>
<p>"the earth. The English fled; the Irish gave an hurrah of tri-
</p>
<p>" umph, and dreadful slaughtering ensued upon the spot. In that
</p>
<p>" battle, O'Neill captured all the military stores, arms, and ammu-
</p>
<p>" nition of the enemy, except the purse and the chest ; that money
</p>
<p>" was thrown into a ditch, and as a matter of history, afterwards it
</p>
<p>"was believed that the English who fought, had no money; but
</p>
<p>" that was not really the fact, for they left it behind, and a man
</p>
<p>" of the name of Logan, about 55 years afterwards, in making a ditch,
</p>
<p>" found about 2000, which they left behind. This battle was
</p>
<p>" fought in Clontibret ; he was then in the 58th year of his age,
</p>
<p>" and he was able, in single combat, to beat the stoutest man
</p>
<p>" in all England ; three years afterwards he fought the great battle

</p>
<p>" of the Yellow Ford. In the same locality, in that battle, the Irish
</p>
<p>" and the English lost their general; the same Sir Henry Bagnall,
</p>
<p>" the murderer of M'Mahon, was shot dead ; all tbe principal officers
</p>
<p>" of the army, and 2,500 soldiers were slain on the field of battle,
</p>
<p>" while the Irish had but 200 men killed, and GOO wounded. Why,
</p>
<p>" it may be asked, when the Irish were so successful, and fought
</p>
<p>" such noble battles, were they some time after so unfortunate? I
</p>
<p>'* answer, English gold or Irish perfidy? and let me ask in return,
</p>
<p>" is there now no English gold and Irish perfidy ? where are all the
</p>
<p>" emancipated Catholic nobles; where are some ? but thanks be
</p>
<p>" to heaven where indeed, where are some of our own prelates ? where
</p>
<p>" are the herds of place-hunters that you have every day about the
</p>
<p>" Castle? Where are the would-be aristocracy that every man will oc-
</p>
<p>" casionally meet in his own little isolated locality ?  the hireling rep-
</p>
<p>" tiles but we have O'Connell, and we can do without them. I have
</p>
<p>" said English gold and Irish perfidy ; a price of two thousand pieces
</p>
<p>144
</p>
<p>" of gold was set upon the head of O'Neill ; deserted and betrayed by
</p>
<p>" many of those who should have supported him, he fled into France,
</p>
<p>" and died at Rome, in the year 1616, in the seventy-ninth year of
</p>
<p>" his age. Oh ! may the errors of the past be the warnings of the
</p>
<p>"future. You have seen the great O'Neill, the descendant of so
</p>
<p>" many kings, the hero of so many fights, the victor of so many
</p>
<p>" battles, sacrificing for ever all his earthly possessions and hereditary
</p>
<p>" estates for love of country ; he sunk into a grave, his ashes are at
</p>
<p>" Rome, they are now in a foreign clime, almost unknown and for-
</p>
<p>" gotten ; oh ! if they are not unknown and forgotten, 1 hope that
</p>
<p>" due honour will yet be be paid to his name and virtues. I have
</p>
<p>" said you are always successful when you are united. Now you are
</p>
<p>" united ! Nothing can mar your prospects ; nothing can blight your
</p>
<p>" success; nothing can prevent you, save either your own timidity,
</p>
<p>" your own treachery, or your own wavering. Are you ready to desert
</p>
<p>" your leader, and sell your country ? then if you are not, and I know
</p>
<p>" you are not, I shall only remark, there are two ways that present
</p>
<p>" themselves to you : one brings you to slavery, the other conducts
</p>
<p>" you to happiness and victory. If you select the first, by cringing
</p>
<p>" and flattery, and licking the hand that smites you, you may prolong
</p>
<p>" a wretched existence for a few years more :
</p>
<p>" Like the lamb that's doomed to bleed to-day ;
</p>
<p>Had he thy reason would he frisk and play,
</p>
<p>And skip about  enjoy his merry mood,
</p>
<p>And lick the hand that's raised to shed his blood ?"
</p>
<p>" If you prefer the latter, honour, glory, your country, your chil-
</p>
<p>" dren, and generations unborn will bless you. Mr. Chairman, in
</p>
<p>" the name of the county I am from, and particularly of my own pa-
</p>
<p>" rish, Clontibret, where a hundred fights were fought, permit me
</p>
<p>" to hand you, in the name of that parish, in the name of that peo-
</p>
<p>" pie, the children of the men that fought the battle of victory, un-
</p>
<p>" assisted from any other locality, but being of the north, and of that
</p>
<p>" county alone, 92." Now, I ask you, do you understand what Mr.
</p>
<p>Tierney meant in the commencement of his speech, by inquiring if

</p>
<p>they came there to enable him (Mr. O'Connell) to make Ireland the
</p>
<p>land of the happy and free, and if they were prepared to do so ? I ask
</p>
<p>you to construe the meaning of Mr. Tierney, when he said, that
</p>
<p>deeds as well as words were required, by what subsequently fell
</p>
<p>from him in relating the battle ; and what he had in view when
</p>
<p>he says, that they are ready to give their hands as well as their
</p>
<p>hearts ? It is impossible to mistake it ; it did not suggest peace.
</p>
<p>I shall now go back a few days, to bring before you some matters
</p>
<p>connected with the preliminaries for the Clontarf meeting. On the
</p>
<p>30th of September, there appeared in the Nation newspaper, an ad-
</p>
<p>vertisement, headed "Repeal cavalry  Clontarf meeting. The
</p>
<p>" committee for this great national demonstration being apprised of
</p>
<p>" the intention of many repealers to appear mounted on Conquer
</p>
<p>" Hill, Clontarf, recommend the following rules to be observed, for
</p>
<p>" the regulation of the cavalcade, at this first muster and march of
</p>
<p>" the mounted repeal volunteers. First, all mounted repealers of the
</p>
<p>145
</p>
<p>" city, or from the south and west side of the county, to muster on
</p>
<p>" the open ground, Harcourt-street fields, on Sunday, the 8th of Oc-
</p>
<p>" toher, at twelve o'clock at noon, and form into troops, each troop
</p>
<p>" to consist of twenty-five horsemen, to be led by one officer in
</p>
<p>" front, followed by six ranks, four a-breast, half distance, each bear-
</p>
<p>" ing a wand and cockade, distinguishing the number of his respec-
</p>
<p>" tive troop. Second, that regulation wands and cockades will be
</p>
<p>" furnished by the committee, to such gentlemen of the city or
</p>
<p>" county as shall apply, and be approved of to lead each troop.
</p>
<p>" Third, that no person shall be permitted to join the cavalcade
</p>
<p>" without a cockade and wand; and that until one troop is complete,
</p>
<p>" no second troop be formed. N. B.  The committee will make the
</p>
<p>" necessary arrangements to prevent delay or confusion at the turn-
</p>
<p>" pike gates. Fourth, each horseman to take and keep the place
</p>
<p>" assigned to him on joining his troop, and remain in rank until dis-
</p>
<p>" missal of the parade in the meeting-field. Fifth, that such troops
</p>
<p>" as shall have formed by half-past twelve o'clock, do proceed in their
</p>
<p>* orderatslowtimeby thefollowing route: Harcourt-street, &c. Sixth,
</p>
<p>" the mounted repealers from the northern parts of the county to
</p>
<p>" muster and form as above prescribed, at the southern extremity of
</p>
<p>" the Howth road. Seventh, that the Chairman and members of
</p>
<p>" the Committee bearing wands and cockades, do form the mount-
</p>
<p>" ed staff in advance, and that the muster, march, and parade at the
</p>
<p>" meeting field, shall be under their sole order and direction, until dis-
</p>
<p>" missed, after the proceedings have commenced. Eighth, that the
</p>
<p>" horsemen on the meeting ground shall keep a proper distance from
</p>
<p>" the platform, so as not to incommode those attending on foot ; and
</p>
<p>" it is earnestly requested on the other hand,- that no obstruction or
</p>
<p>" interruption will be offered to the cavalcade, by those on foot, or
</p>
<p>" in vehicles, so that the order and regularity of the march may be
</p>
<p>" preserved. God save the Queen. Mount for repeal. March
</p>
<p>"for Clontarf." That appeared on the 30th of September. On the
</p>
<p>2nd of October, at the Association, Mr. O'Connell observed : " I
</p>
<p>" saw with surprise, a paragraph in the Nation newspaper, which

</p>
<p>" ought not to have been printed, although it appeared a very good
</p>
<p>" quiz, and 1 beg you will not pay any attention to it." This ad-
</p>
<p>vertisement was suppressed, and another was substituted in its
</p>
<p>place, apparently as if a pen were taken, and the military words struck
</p>
<p>out, by turning the word troop into group, and omitting the words
</p>
<p>muster, officer, march, but leaving it in all other respects the same.
</p>
<p>This document, this quiz, every person understood. It was more
</p>
<p>convenient to call troop, group. Then, after considering that they
</p>
<p>had struck out all the objectionable parts, the advertisement stands
</p>
<p>in the same form, leaving the substance and the sense, with all its
</p>
<p>illegality on the face of it, as it was published, and I tell you that this
</p>
<p>advertisement was illegal. In the case of Redford v. Birley, which I
</p>
<p>have already referred to, Lord Tenterden says, in page 128 : "It is by
</p>
<p>u no means to be taken for granted that it is lawful for the subjects
</p>
<p>"of this country to practise military manoeuvres and exercises under
</p>
<p>'leaders of their own, without authority. It is not to be taken for
</p>
<p>u
</p>
<p>146
</p>
<p>"granted that that is law. I helieve, on investigation of the subject,
</p>
<p>" it will be found not to be law."
</p>
<p>On the 6th of October an article appeared in the Pilot news-
</p>
<p>paper headed  The Battle oj Clontarf-  This is the Repeal Year.
</p>
<p>" Among the many things that have been done in it to awaken
</p>
<p>" an Irish spirit amongst the inhabitants of this country, and to
</p>
<p>" teach them a self-confidence and a self-respect, nothing has been
</p>
<p>" more effectual than the holding of meetings on particular spots
</p>
<p>" where their ancestors had suffered some great disaster, or ob-
</p>
<p>" tained some signal advantage. It is, as it were, treading over the
</p>
<p>" days that are passed, or reading the history of Ireland anew.
</p>
<p>" It is recalling to our minds, as in a picture, the calamities that
</p>
<p>" our fathers experienced, or the feats they achieved. For this rea-
</p>
<p>" son it was wise that meetings should be held at Tara and Mullagh-
</p>
<p>" mast, and for this reason it is particularly wise that another should
</p>
<p>" be held at Clontarf. In the whole range of Irish topography no
</p>
<p>" spot is more celebrated than this. It was here that Irishmen, under
</p>
<p>" a commander as prudent as brave, taught a lesson to their Danish
</p>
<p>" invaders that has never been forgotten. Would to God that there
</p>
<p>" had been soldiers of equal spirit, and commanders of equal prudence
</p>
<p>" and bravery to meet the plundering and bloodthirsty Saxons in sub-
</p>
<p>" sequent years, when they first set their feet upon our soil ! Oh ! if
</p>
<p>" there had what a world of misery Ireland had been spared ! Should
</p>
<p>" the game of subduing us be attempted now, however, such a peo-
</p>
<p>" pie exists  such a commander could be found. Some say our
</p>
<p>u leader is too old for the camp or the field. It is false. He is of
</p>
<p>" Herculean frame, buoyant in spirit, and youthful in constitution.
</p>
<p>" His age is only sixty-eight years. That of Brian Boroihme, when
</p>
<p>"on Good Friday, in 1014, he fought and conquered the Danes at
</p>
<p>" Clontarf, was eighty-eight years. This should serve to warn our
</p>
<p>"rulers against wantonly attacking O'Connell. Clontarf!  they
</p>
<p>" should remember Clontarf." The article then gives a description
</p>
<p>of that battle, and continues : " Thus terminated the battle of
</p>
<p>" Clontarf. What strikes a person most on reading the account of it

</p>
<p>" is, the bravery that the Dalcassians, under Brian, displayed in re-
</p>
<p>" pelling such a host of invaders from their shores, to which they
</p>
<p>" had been welcomed by so many traitors among the Leinster Irish.
</p>
<p>" In those days every petty chieftain was called a king, and had, no
</p>
<p>"doubt, his passions and his jealousies as well as greater monarchs.
</p>
<p>" Brian, stern and vigorous, was a man of such consummate judgment
</p>
<p>" and bravery, that he awed some and conciliated others into submis-
</p>
<p>" sion to his authority. Had Ireland been unanimous in his time, or in
</p>
<p>" the subsequent time of Henry the Second, neitherthe Danes, nor the
</p>
<p>" Saxon serfs headed by the Norman robbers, would have dared to set
</p>
<p>" their foot on her shores ; but it was the destiny of her children to be
</p>
<p>"always disunited amongst themselves, and through that means they
</p>
<p>" became a prey to the tyrants and plunderers by whom they were
</p>
<p>" attacked. A new spirit has however arisen in our days. Ireland
</p>
<p>" is becoming united ; for we make little count of the few paltry
</p>
<p>" bigots that are keeping aloof. Education is doing its work  pre-
</p>
<p>judices are melting before it. It is an indisputable fact that
</p>
<p>147
</p>
<p>** the people of this country were never so much under the com-
</p>
<p>" maud of any one man, or so manageable, as they are at pre-
</p>
<p>" sent. Neither were they ever so sober, so intelligent, or more
</p>
<p>" brave. From this it follows that they never were so formida-
</p>
<p>" ble, if want only attacked ; and the physical, the moral, the intel-
</p>
<p>"lectual position of them, together with the coolness, the courage, and
</p>
<p>" the great capacity of their leader, should, as it will, protect them
</p>
<p>" from aggression. All that could be required of them if they were
</p>
<p>"attacked would be to imitate the conduct of their ancestors, the
</p>
<p>" Dalcassians, who never entered a field without being resolved to
</p>
<p>" conquer or die." A detail is then given of the hardships expe-
</p>
<p>rienced by those Dalcassians on their return to their own country,
</p>
<p>and the article concludes : " May the Irish people of the present
</p>
<p>" day, should they be driven to it, imitate the conduct of the brave
</p>
<p>" Tipperary men, or former Dalcassians." That publication appeared
</p>
<p>on the Friday previous to the day appointed for the meeting, which
</p>
<p>promised to be of a most formidable character, keeping in view that
</p>
<p>the parties were to form under the direction of the Association, and
</p>
<p>to assemble for the purpose of proceeding to that meeting. On the 7th
</p>
<p>of October, a letter appeared in the Nation newspaper, signed A Dal-
</p>
<p>cassian. It was as follows : " There is not amongst the millions who
</p>
<p>" are banded to obtain a repeal of the pretended Union, one man
</p>
<p>" who more fervently desires to see Ireland for the Irish than I do,
</p>
<p>M nor one who would more gladly seek to efface the very footsteps
</p>
<p>" of the foreign spoliator from our soil. I beg to offer a suggestion
</p>
<p>" to my countrymen  to the old people of the Scots, whereby that
</p>
<p>" effect would certainly be produced to a certain extent, and ano-
</p>
<p>" ther significant indication given of our unchangeable determination
</p>
<p>ooo
</p>
<p>" that Ireland shall not be for the Saxon or the Norman, but for
</p>
<p>" the Gael, from henceforth to the end of time." The writer then
</p>
<p>proposes, that after the meeting at Clontarf, the Irish shall discon-
</p>
<p>tinue to adopt the Saxon names for places, and that the original
</p>
<p>Irish names thall be resumed. Gentlemen, you are aware, and it is

</p>
<p>not necessary that I should do more than advert to it, that the
</p>
<p>meeting to be held at Clontarf was prevented by a proclamation.
</p>
<p>It was to have been the first of those five, six, or seven meetings
</p>
<p>which Mr. O'Connell stated would be held before the closing of the
</p>
<p>year ; that meeting did not take place, and, I believe, it did not take
</p>
<p>place from a conviction which existed of its illegality.
</p>
<p>On the following day, the 9th of October, a meeting was held at
</p>
<p>Calvert's theatre ; it was a meeting of the Repeal Association, and
</p>
<p>there were present at it Mr. O'Connell, Mr. John O'Connell, Mr. Ray,
</p>
<p>Mr. Steele, Dr. Gray, and the Rev. Mr. Tyrrell, who has since died.
</p>
<p>I should not have thought it necessary to state any thing that fell from
</p>
<p>Mr. Tyrrell, but that he proposed an important resolution which was
</p>
<p>to have been proposed by him at Clontarf, in case the meeting had ta-
</p>
<p>ken place. He said : " We are come here for the purpose of proposing
</p>
<p>" resolutions at this meeting, which would have been proposed for
</p>
<p>" your adoption at the meeting yesterday, if it had taken place. I will
</p>
<p>" read them first, and then place them in the hands of our respected
</p>
<p>" chairman." And accordingly they were read by Mr. John O'Con-
</p>
<p>148
</p>
<p>nell, who acted in the capacity of chairman : " Resolved, that this
</p>
<p>' meeting hereby declares its devoted loyalty to the person and throne
</p>
<p>" of Her Gracious Majesty, Queen Victoria, Queen of Ireland, and
</p>
<p>" its determination to uphold and maintain inviolate all the preroga-
</p>
<p>" tives of the Crown, as guaranteed by the constitution.  That we,
</p>
<p>" the clergy, gentry, freeholders, burgesses, and other inhabitants of
</p>
<p>" Fingal, in public meeting assembled, declare and pronounce in the
</p>
<p>" presence of our country, before Europe and America, and in the
</p>
<p>" sight of heaven, that no power on earth ought of right, to make
</p>
<p>" laws to bind this kingdom, save the Queen, Lords, and Commons of
</p>
<p>" Ireland ; and here, standing on the ever-memorable battle-field of
</p>
<p>" Clontarf, the Marathon of Ireland, we solemnly pledge ourselves to
</p>
<p>" use every constitutional exertion to free this our native land from the
</p>
<p>" tyranny of being legislated for by others than its own inhabitants. 
</p>
<p>" That forty-five years of devoted and successful labour in the cause
</p>
<p>" of his country, have justly earned for O'Connell, the Liberator
</p>
<p>" of Ireland, the unbounded confidence of the Irish people; and
</p>
<p>" that we, relying upon his supreme wisdom, discretion, patriotism,
</p>
<p>" and undaunted firmness, hereby pledge ourselves, individually and
</p>
<p>" collectively, to follow his guidance, under any and every circum-
</p>
<p>" stance that may arise ; and come weal, come woe, never to desert the
</p>
<p>" constitutional standard of repeal which he has raised  That petitions
</p>
<p>" to the houses of Lords and Commons would be adopted, praying for
</p>
<p>" the recognition of the inalienable rights of the Irish nation to a
</p>
<p>" domestic legislature ; and in order thereto, for a repeal of the
</p>
<p>" legislative Union." I have already in an earlier part of the case
</p>
<p>adverted to those resolutions ; they are not exactly, but very nearly,
</p>
<p>the same in terms as those on the repeal card, and I merely beg to
</p>
<p>remind you, that as there is an attempt to draw an analogy between
</p>
<p>these resolutions and those of the Irish volunteers, that there is a great
</p>
<p>distinction between them. Ireland was then represented by her own
</p>
<p>Parliament. The Union did not exist, but it is now law by the adop-
</p>
<p>tion of the articles of Union. If at the time those resolutions were
</p>
<p>passed, claims were made by the English Parliament to govern Ire-

</p>
<p>land, by laws passed by that Parliament where she was not repre-
</p>
<p>sented, that would be sufficient to justify those resolutions which
</p>
<p>are sought to be established by the precedent of the Irish Volunteers;
</p>
<p>but I impeach the legality of any resolutions which assert that no
</p>
<p>power except the Queen, Lords, and Commons of Ireland, ought to
</p>
<p>legislate for Ireland, and they ought not to have been adopted.
</p>
<p>I have gone through a statement, of the several meetings, which
</p>
<p>I thought it might be important to direct the attention of the Court
</p>
<p>and Jury to. I shall now recall to your recollection the charge for
</p>
<p>which the traversers have been indicted. They stand indicted, for
</p>
<p>combining and confederating together, to raise discontent and dis-
</p>
<p>affection amongst her Majesty's subjects, and to excite them to hatred
</p>
<p>and contempt of the Government and Constitution of the realm, as
</p>
<p>by law established. Now I would ask you, gentlemen of the Jury,
</p>
<p>whether, after all the details which I have laid before you, if they
</p>
<p>be proved, you can entertain any doubt of the guilt of the traversers of
</p>
<p>149
</p>
<p>a conspiracy to excite discontent and disaffection among her Majesty's
</p>
<p>subjects, and to excite hostility against the Government, and also,
</p>
<p>which is another branch of the indictment, to excite disaffection
</p>
<p>amongst her Majesty's subjects serving in the army. It is impossible
</p>
<p>to carry on thegovernment of a country, if in a united kingdom, the
</p>
<p>inhabitants of different parts of the empire are to be excited to hos-
</p>
<p>tility towards each other. I am satisfied that they would not be ex-
</p>
<p>cited to hostility, were it not for the mischievous agitation which is
</p>
<p>kept up in this country ; and that when the evidence on this portion
</p>
<p>of the indictment is detailed before you in proof, you will concur
</p>
<p>with me, if I have established the case which I have stated, that it is
</p>
<p>your bounden duty not to hesitate to find the traversers guilty of
</p>
<p>this portion of the charge. Another portion of this serious con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, was to excite disaffection in the army. The progress of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy may be well understood ; first, it was necessary to excite
</p>
<p>discontent among the people, and then it was necessary to excite
</p>
<p>hostility against that portion of the empire with which Ireland is
</p>
<p>united, and most active measures were taken to excite that hostility.
</p>
<p>It became important with this view that the people should be shown
</p>
<p>their strength, in the first instance. In order to organize them, they
</p>
<p>accustomed them to come from remote distances, and having taught
</p>
<p>them their own strength, they sought by means of this demonstra-
</p>
<p>tion of physical force to awe the Government into granting the
</p>
<p>object of this confederacy  the Kepeal of the Union. But so long
</p>
<p>as the army remained faithful, there was little hope of success from this
</p>
<p>organization and assembling of those thousands in different parts of
</p>
<p>the country. They seem to have been following up, step by step,
</p>
<p>what was considered in 1797, the year before the rebellion, most
</p>
<p>important, namely, to endeavour to alienate the minds of the army,
</p>
<p>and create among them a spirit of discontent and disaffection, and
</p>
<p>more especially among the non-commissioned officers, for the purpose
</p>
<p>of obtaining their assistance in carrying out this revolution, which you
</p>
<p>are told by one of the traversers, is to end in a division of property in
</p>
<p>the country. A portion of the charge also, gentlemen, as you are aware,

</p>
<p>was that the traversers conspired to cause large numbers of persons to
</p>
<p>assemble together, for the unlawful purpose, by means of the intimi-
</p>
<p>dation to be thereby created, and the demonstration of physical force,
</p>
<p>to procure and effect changes to be made in the government and
</p>
<p>constitution of the country, and particularly by these means to ac-
</p>
<p>complish a dissolution of the legislative Union. Gentlemen, I think
</p>
<p>at the opening of this case, I sufficiently pointed out, and in this
</p>
<p>I think I shall have the concurrence of the Court, that in order to
</p>
<p>render meetings of this description illegal, it was not necessary that
</p>
<p>any immediate apprehension of a breach of the peace should be enter-
</p>
<p>tained. I believe it was the object and wish of Mr. O'Connell, that
</p>
<p>the parties at those meetings should separate peaceably, and it ap-
</p>
<p>pears that in his addresses and speeches, at most of the meetings, he
</p>
<p>expressed that wish ; but I am also satisfied that there was an ulti-
</p>
<p>mate object, that when the organization was complete, when every
</p>
<p>Repeal Warden in Ireland had brought each parish to that state of
</p>
<p>150
</p>
<p>discipline, that, as Mr. Duffy said, they would be ready for liberty,
</p>
<p>then it was intended, to use the language of Mr. Barrett, that Ireland
</p>
<p>should stamp her foot, and the Repeal should be granted. Whether
</p>
<p>it was the intention of the traversers, by these inflammatory speeches
</p>
<p>and publications, to lead to an actual outbreak hereafter or not, is
</p>
<p>not material to the purpose of the present charge against them.
</p>
<p>If they had it in contemplation to the full extent, if they in-
</p>
<p>tended that at some future period there should be an outbreak,
</p>
<p>headed by one of the traversers, in point of law that would be a
</p>
<p>higher offence than that for which they are now indicted. It is
</p>
<p>sufficient, for the purpose of the present indictment, it being for a
</p>
<p>misdemeanor subjecting them to fine and imprisonment, that you
</p>
<p>should believe that these meetings were held for the purpose of
</p>
<p>overawing the legislature, and by the demonstration of physical
</p>
<p>force and organization throughout the country, in the end to get a Re-
</p>
<p>peal of the Union, otherwise than by the constituted tribunals of the
</p>
<p>country, the United Parliament. If their intention was to overawe
</p>
<p>the legislature, and to obtain a Repeal by the organization effected,
</p>
<p>and the intimidation practised, I need scarcely inform you that was il-
</p>
<p>legal, for then it would be utterly impossible to carry on the government
</p>
<p>of the country, if such important alterations were not to be made by the
</p>
<p>representatives of the people, but by the people themselves, by means
</p>
<p>of the physical force which they have displayed. One mischief aris-
</p>
<p>ing from these assembled multitudes is that which Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>adverted to at Mullaghmast, that when the people were organized to
</p>
<p>the extent to which they are, even though he were anxious that
</p>
<p>there should be no outrage, that all should be peaceable, he might
</p>
<p>not be able to control them under his command, after having excited
</p>
<p>them to this extent. At Mullaghmast he adverted to this appre-
</p>
<p>hension which he felt, and said it came across him like a sickly
</p>
<p>dream, and he appealed to them whether they would continue to
</p>
<p>obey him. I certainly will admit that it was not intended that
</p>
<p>there should be an outbreak ; that was part of the system adopted
</p>
<p>in this conspiracy, and of course we have reason to rejoice that
</p>

</p>
<p>such a course was adopted ; but that does not take away from
</p>
<p>the illegality of those proceedings. If the intention was to or-
</p>
<p>ganize the people to that extent that the Government of the country
</p>
<p>could not be carried on independently, but by force of the control
</p>
<p>of those assembled multitudes, who were to dictate to the legislature
</p>
<p>the course they were to adopt, that was illegal. Although through-
</p>
<p>out these speeches and publications no ultimate outbreak was ad-
</p>
<p>verted and looked to, yet I believe they intended to carry on the
</p>
<p>intimidation by those meetings, and by the assembly of so many
</p>
<p>thousand persons, rather than to create any present disturbance. It
</p>
<p>is sufficient for mv purpose, if you should believe that these multi-
</p>
<p>tudes were assembled together for the purpose of intimidation by
</p>
<p>the demonstration of physical force, although there might be no'
</p>
<p>actual intention of using it, except for intimidation. If that be the
</p>
<p>case, they are guilty under this indictment. It is not necessary for
</p>
<p>the purposes of this prosecution, that you should believe that an
</p>
<p>151
</p>
<p>ultimate outbreak was intended. As I have already said, and as
</p>
<p>was said by Mr. Justice Rooke, though one of the traversers might
</p>
<p>not have intended the consequences that might result from their acts,
</p>
<p>it might as well be said, by a person who fired a pistol among a
</p>
<p>crowd, that he did not intend to kill any person. When Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell said, that he had a sickly dream come* over him, he was afraid
</p>
<p>that the people's feelings had been wound up to so great an extent, that
</p>
<p>an outbreak might take place ; but whether he intended or not,
</p>
<p>that there should be no future outbreak, no physical force, yet I tell
</p>
<p>you, that these meetings, and that combination, were illegal under
</p>
<p>the charges in the present indictment. There is another branch
</p>
<p>of this indictment, relating to the establishing of the Arbitration
</p>
<p>Courts, which you have already heard. I may now tell you, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, that in a conspiracy of this kind, although I have stated to you
</p>
<p>the entire of it, and each part of it is intimately connected with the
</p>
<p>other, it is not necessary that you should come to the conclusion
</p>
<p>that the traversers are guilty of every portion of it ; it is not neces-
</p>
<p>sary for the Crown to establish every portion of the conspiracy ; it is
</p>
<p>sufficient if you are of opinion that they are guilty of any one part.
</p>
<p>Although 1 believe I shall be able to establish every portion of' the
</p>
<p>charge, yet I think it necessary to state this.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I have now detained you for a great length of time,
</p>
<p>audi will conclude by using the language used by a most eminent Judge,
</p>
<p>Chief Justice Bushe, at the Maryborough Special Commission : " I will
</p>
<p>" conclude by recalling your attention to all that is in our power to
</p>
<p>" do, and that is our duty. Let us do that firmly and temperately ;
</p>
<p>" 1 say firmly and temperately, for in agitated times it is hard to
</p>
<p>" preserve the equable balance of the mind. Fear is a corrupting
</p>
<p>" principle, and alarm operates in different and opposite directions.
</p>
<p>" In such times, the influence of panic has led men, I am sorry to
</p>
<p>" say of all classes, to truckle to the insurgents, to decline those duties
</p>
<p>" which the administration of justice calls for ; or, what is worse, to
</p>
<p>" discharge them in a spirit of base compromise, in the silly hope of
</p>
<p>" securing what could never be more than a temporary and precarious

</p>
<p>" safety, or from the more abject motive of earning an ignominious
</p>
<p>" popularity ; on the other hand, panic is often the source of a blind,
</p>
<p>" rash, indiscriniinating zeal, or exasperating energy, more resembling
</p>
<p>" the temper of war, than the stayed step and sober-minded charac-
</p>
<p>" ter of justice. We should always remember that we are engaged
</p>
<p>" in a conflict of law against outrage, and not of one violence against
</p>
<p>" another ; and that in proportion as the enormity of the offence calls
</p>
<p>" for exertion, it also calls upon us to distrust, or, at least, to watch
</p>
<p>" ourselves, and to proceed cautiously and circumspectly, not only
</p>
<p>" because the punishments to be inflicted are heavy, but because
</p>
<p>"it is impossible to approach the discharge of our present duties
</p>
<p>" without a deep and personal interest in putting down the existing
</p>
<p>"mischief; an interest which we are bound to neutralize by the
</p>
<p>" coolest impartiality." He then concludes: "Let us therefore co-
</p>
<p>" operate in our several departments, in carrying into execution the
</p>
<p>" laws of our country ; and in the grand jury room, in the petty jury
</p>
<p>152
</p>
<p>" box, and on the Bench, enter into a covenant with ourselves, so
</p>
<p>" calmly and scrupulously to investigate every charge, as to insure
</p>
<p>" the conviction of every guilty man, and the acquittal of every man
</p>
<p>" whose innocence is manifested or whose guilt is made doubtful."
</p>
<p>THURSDAY, January 18th.
</p>
<p>Frederick Bond Hughes sworn, and examined by the Solicitor-
</p>
<p>General.
</p>
<p>I am a short-hand writer. I have been in the habit of reporting
</p>
<p>for 17 or 18 years. I recollect coming to this country in September
</p>
<p>last. I arrived on Saturday the 30th of September. I never had
</p>
<p>been in Ireland before. I recollect the following day the 1st of
</p>
<p>October. I went on that clay to a place called Mullaghmast, in the
</p>
<p>county of Kildare. I arrived there about half-past 12 o'clock. There
</p>
<p>were many persons present when I arrived, and they gradually began
</p>
<p>to increase to a large number. As near as I could guess, 30,000
</p>
<p>or 40,000 persons were present; I could not see over the whole
</p>
<p>extent of the ground. I saw no particular exhibitions, except persons
</p>
<p>coming from different parts with banners. I took on that occasion
</p>
<p>a memorandum of what passed, that is, of the speeches. I have it
</p>
<p>here.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor General  Before you refer to your notes, can you
</p>
<p>mention some of the inscriptions on the banners ?
</p>
<p>" Hurrah for Repeal," I think was the inscription on one of
</p>
<p>the banners. " The Men of the Border County" was another ;
</p>
<p>those were in front of the platform. "The man who commits a
</p>
<p>crime is an Enemy to his Country," was another. " A Country of
</p>
<p>Nine Millions is too great to be dragged at the tail of any Nation."
</p>
<p>The musicians connected with the various parties had on a sort of
</p>
<p>fancy dress. I did not observe how many bands there were. There
</p>
<p>were several persons about the platform with papers on their hats and
</p>
<p>staves in their hands, and on the paper was inscribed " O'Connell's
</p>
<p>Police." I know the traverser, Mr. Daniel O'Connell. I see him in
</p>
<p>Court. It was on a Sunday that the meetingtook place. Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell arrived at about two o'clock. I am not aware that I saw Mr. John

</p>
<p>O'Connell on that occasion. Mr. Ray and Dr. Gray were present. I
</p>
<p>think I should recollect Mr. Ray. Dr. Gray is sitting behind me. So
</p>
<p>is Mr. Kay. I know Mr. Steele. I saw him there. I see him in
</p>
<p>Court. Mr. O'Connell had a sort of velvet robe on. It was scarlet
</p>
<p>or claret colour. After the arrival of Mr. O'Connell some gentleman
</p>
<p>proposed that he should take the chair. That motion was put and car-
</p>
<p>ried. Mr. Caulfield, I think, proposed it. Mr. O'Connell addressed
</p>
<p>the meeting. I took a note of what Mr. O'Connell said on that oc-
</p>
<p>casion. I took it in short-hand, to the best of my ability. I have
</p>
<p>both the original notes, and the transcript here.
</p>
<p>'The Solicitor General,  I do not want to take you through the
</p>
<p>153
</p>
<p>whole of what was said. Begin at the first page, ami read to their
</p>
<p>Lordships and the jury, what Mr. O'Connell said [see ante,\~>. 133].
</p>
<p>Mr. Monahan.  Read the whole of the speech from beginning
</p>
<p>to end.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell.  There are passages which we consider most mate-
</p>
<p>rial to the traversers. [The Witness then read the speech of Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell at Mullaghmast.]
</p>
<p>Examination resumed  I heard resolutions proposed at that
</p>
<p>meeting. Mr. Ayhner proposed the first resolution. The first reso-
</p>
<p>lution was in the following words: " Resolved, that this meeting
</p>
<p>" hereby declares its devoted loyalty to the person and throne of Her
</p>
<p>" Gracious Majesty Victoria, Queen of Ireland, ana its determi-
</p>
<p>" nation to uphold and maintain inviolate all the prerogatives of
</p>
<p>" the Crown as guaranteed by the Constitution." That resolution
</p>
<p>was carried. The second resolution was proposed by Mr. Joseph
</p>
<p>Hacket of Kilkenny, and seconded by Alderman Keshan. It was :
</p>
<p>" That we the clergy, gentry, freeholders, burgesses, and other inha-
</p>
<p>" bitants of the province of Leinster, in public meeting assembled,
</p>
<p>" declare and pronounce, in the presence of our country, before
</p>
<p>" Europe and America, and in the sight of Heaven, that no power
</p>
<p>" on earth ought of right to make laws to bind this kingdom, save the
</p>
<p>" Queen, Lords and Commons of Ireland ; and here standing on the
</p>
<p>" graves of the martyred dead, we solemnly pledge ourselves to use
</p>
<p>" every constitutional exertion to free this our native land from the
</p>
<p>" tyranny of being legislated for by others than her own inhabi-
</p>
<p>" tants." That resolution was put by the chairman, Mr. O'Connell,
</p>
<p>and carried. Some gentleman then came forward with a velvet cap.
</p>
<p>It was a round velvet cap. It was 'Mr. O'Callaghan who presented
</p>
<p>it. He said :" I am deputed by the committee, who send me to
</p>
<p>present you with the National Cap." He then read an address.
</p>
<p>The cap was then placed on the head of Mr. O'Connell. [The Wit-
</p>
<p>ness then read the observations made by Mr. O'Connell]. A reso-
</p>
<p>lution was then proposed for the adoption of a petition to Parliament,
</p>
<p>for a repeal of the Union, which was to be presented by a repeal

</p>
<p>member. After that, the following resolution was proposed :  " Re-
</p>
<p>" solved, that forty-four years of devoted and successful labour
</p>
<p>" in the cause of his country, have justly earned for O'Connell, the
</p>
<p>" Liberator of Ireland, the unbounded confidence of the Irish people ;
</p>
<p>" and that we, relying upon his superior wisdom, discretion, patri-
</p>
<p>" otism and undaunted firmness, hereby pledge ourselves individually
</p>
<p>" and collectively to follow his guidance, under any and every eir-
</p>
<p>" cumstance that may arise, come weal or come woe, never to de-
</p>
<p>" sert the constitutional standard of repeal, which he has raised."
</p>
<p>That resolution was put from the chair, and carried. It was not put
</p>
<p>by Mr. O'Connell. A gentleman was called to the chair to pass the
</p>
<p>resolution. The meeting was held in the open air, at a place called
</p>
<p>the Rath of Mullaghmast. There was a dinner on the same day, at
</p>
<p>Mullaghmast. Mr. O'Connell, Mr. John O'Connell, Mr. Steele,' Mr.
</p>
<p>Barrett, Dr. Gray, and Mr. Ray were present. I never had seen
</p>
<p>any of them, except Mr. John O'Connell and Mr. Daniel O'Connell,
</p>
<p>x
</p>
<p>154
</p>
<p>before that day. I saw them in Parliament. I never was in Ireland
</p>
<p>before. Mr. John O'Connell presided at that dinner. After dinner
</p>
<p>Mr. John O'Connell made a speech. Several letters were read. A
</p>
<p>letter was read from Mr. Thomas Ffrench. [The Witness read the let-
</p>
<p>ter]. There was a gentleman, who I was told was Mr. Barrett, there.
</p>
<p>He made a speech during that evening. [The witness read the speech,
</p>
<p>see ante, p. 138.] Mr. O'Connell's health was proposed ; in returning
</p>
<p>thanks, he spoke. Mr. Ray spoke at that meeting. The toast of the
</p>
<p>" Repeal Association" was given. Mr. Ray was called on to respond
</p>
<p>to it. Dr. Gray was at that meeting. He spoke to the toast of the " dis-
</p>
<p>missed magistrates, and Repeal Arbitrators." I recollect Monday, the
</p>
<p>2nd of October. There was a meeting of the Association on that
</p>
<p>day. I got admittance by stating that I attended to report. I ob-
</p>
<p>tained a ticket on the following day. I got it from Mr. Ray. It
</p>
<p>was in the following words :  "Admit the bearer, Mr. Hughes, of the
</p>
<p>Press, at all times, to our meeting, T. M. Ray." On the back :
</p>
<p>" Loyal National Repeal Association." At the time Mr. Ray wrote
</p>
<p>this, I said to him, " you had better state that I am Reporter for the
</p>
<p>Government. He said, " that will do for the present ; the Concilia-
</p>
<p>tion Hall will soon be open, and you will have a place to yourself."
</p>
<p>I mentioned at Mullaghmast, that I came to report for the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment. Mr. O'Connell stated, that he understood there was a gen-
</p>
<p>tleman there on the part of the Government. I immediately stood
</p>
<p>up and said, that I attended on the part of the Government, to re-
</p>
<p>port the proceedings. Mr. O'Connell then said, that on former oc-
</p>
<p>casions gentlemen had attended to report at the Catholic Associa-
</p>
<p>tion ; that he had afforded them every facility, and had given them
</p>
<p>access to documents ; and that any accommodation he had afforded
</p>
<p>those gentlemen, he would be happy to afford to me. I believe it
</p>
<p>was also through Mr. O'Connell that I received a ticket to attend
</p>
<p>the banquet.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor General.  Do you see Mr. Barrett in Court?
</p>
<p>The Witness. [Looking at Mr. Barrett]  That is the gentleman,
</p>
<p>to the best of my belief, whom I saw at Mullaghmast, and who made

</p>
<p>the speech which I have read as Mr. Barrett's. On the 2nd of Oc-
</p>
<p>tober I took a note of what took place at the Association. I find in
</p>
<p>it a report of a speech made by Mr. O'Connell upon a letter from
</p>
<p>Limerick being read by Mr. Ray, the Secretary. [The witness read
</p>
<p>the speech, in which Mr. O'Connell referred to an advertisement
</p>
<p>which appeared in the papers, headed " Repeal Cavalry," in relation
</p>
<p>to the Clontarf meeting, and in which he stated, that though a good
</p>
<p>quiz, it ought never to have been printed]. On the 3rd of October,
</p>
<p>1843, I was at the Corn Exchange. At the meeting of the 2nd of
</p>
<p>October, 1843, there were present, Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Ray, Mr.
</p>
<p>Steele. On the 3rd of October, 1843, Mr. O'Connell, Mr. John
</p>
<p>O'Connell, Mr. Ray, Mr. Steele, Mr. Dutfy, Rev. Mr. Tierney, Dr.
</p>
<p>Gray, Dr. Murphy, and several others were present. Mr. Duffy is
</p>
<p>in court, sitting next to Mr. Tierney. A letter from Loughrea was
</p>
<p>read at that meeting. I must state that all the letters and papers in
</p>
<p>my notes are not copies of the originals. I was told that those which
</p>
<p>155
</p>
<p>appeared in the papers were authentic. I applied to Dr. Gray for
</p>
<p>the resolutions at Mullaghmast. I first applied to Mr. Ray ; I was
</p>
<p>told 1 should apply to Dr. Gray. When I saw Dr. Gray, I told him
</p>
<p>I was referred to him by Mr. Ray, for copies of the resolutions. He
</p>
<p>appeared to have some reluctance to give them to me.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon.  I beg your pardon, Sir ; state what he said, and
</p>
<p>do not give any inference of your own.
</p>
<p>Witness  This was several days after the meeting at Mullaghmast.
</p>
<p>Dr. Gray said he could not find the resolutions. I did not get them
</p>
<p>afterwards. When he stated he could not find them, I said I applied
</p>
<p>to him in consequence of Mr. O'Connell having promised me a copy
</p>
<p>of the resolutions at Mullaghmast; and that I wished him to com-
</p>
<p>municate with Mr. O'Connell on the subject. He said he would
</p>
<p>take an hour to consider ; and then he would write to me a note to
</p>
<p>say what his determination was. I said, " Oh ! do not write to me; you
</p>
<p>had better see Mr. O'Connell on the matter." I was then about
</p>
<p>leaving. When we were at the staircase Mr. O'Connell was coming up.
</p>
<p>I said, " Here is Mr. O'Connell now, Dr. Gray ; will you speak to
</p>
<p>him ?" Mr. O'Connell said, " Well, Mr. Hughes, are you here for
</p>
<p>documents?" or some such words. I said I had applied to Dr. Gray
</p>
<p>for the resolutions at Mullaghmast, and that he had said he could not
</p>
<p>find them. Dr. Gray then took Mr. O'Connell into a private room.
</p>
<p>Shortly after Dr. Gray came out. I asked him again, " Am I to have
</p>
<p>the documents, or do you refuse them ?" He said, " Oh, no ; I do
</p>
<p>not refuse them. I do not mean any disrespect to you ; but I can-
</p>
<p>not lay my hands on them."
</p>
<p>Mr. Rigby, (one of the Jurors). Who said that ?
</p>
<p>Witness  Dr. Gray. He then said: "If I could find the original do-
</p>
<p>" cument I don't think 1 should waste my time in writing them out for
</p>
<p>" Sir Robert Peel." I said : " I have nothing to do with Sir Robert
</p>
<p>Peel, I apply to you in my character as short-hand writer." Dr.
</p>
<p>Gray then said : " You can take them from the newspapers  they are
</p>
<p>authentic." I was at the Corn Exchange on the following day ; 1 told
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell I had applied to Dr. Gray, and that he had declined

</p>
<p>to give me the copies, and that he had told me I should get them in
</p>
<p>the newspapers, and that they were authentic. Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>said : " Yes, they are authentic." A letter from Loughrea was read
</p>
<p>at the meeting.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell objected to reading the letter from the news-
</p>
<p>papers.
</p>
<p>Witness.  I think I have got the original. The copy of the
</p>
<p>letter is dated Loughrea, October 2, 1843, and signed by Patrick
</p>
<p>Skenett, Chairman of the Town Commissioners of Loughrea, was
</p>
<p>handed to me by Mr. Ray. It states that the writer forwarded
</p>
<p>14, as the subscription of fourteen of the Town Commissioners of
</p>
<p>Loughrea. He stated the names of the subscribers, and said : " They
</p>
<p>" have remitted these subscriptions through the Rev. J. Macklin.
</p>
<p>" One will pay in few clays, and two or three, who are recusants, it is
</p>
<p>" determined to expel from our body with all convenient despatch,
</p>
<p>" when the proper opportunity occurs." Mr. O'Connell read the
</p>
<p>156
</p>
<p>letter at the meeting ; after reading it he moved that the letter
</p>
<p>should he inserted on the minutes, and said : " They are quite
</p>
<p>right to turn out those who would not become repealers."
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin,  .To whom was the letter addressed ?
</p>
<p>Witness.  This is a copy ; there is no address on it. After read-
</p>
<p>ii\f the letter Mr. O'Connell moved that it should be inserted on the
</p>
<p>minutes, and that the thanks of the Association should be conveyed
</p>
<p>to the writer, and the other gentlemen mentioned therein. Mr. Steele
</p>
<p>was present at that meeting. He addressed the meeting. Dr.
</p>
<p>Gray then proceeded to read the names of certain persons whom he
</p>
<p>moved should be appointed Arbitrators, and Mr. O'Connell seconded
</p>
<p>the motion, and it was carried. Dr. Gray then said he had a short
</p>
<p>report from the Arbitration Committee to present, and he had to move
</p>
<p>that some gentlemen be appointed Arbitrators, the first of whom was
</p>
<p>Mr.O'Connell. Mr.O'Connellsaid: "Iacceptthe office withgreat plea-
</p>
<p>sure." Dr. Gray then read from a paper a list of the Arbitrators who
</p>
<p>had been appointed ; many of whom were gentlemen who had been
</p>
<p>dismissed from the commission of the peace. Mr. O'Connell, on the
</p>
<p>reading of the paper, said : " I hope I shall live to see the day when
</p>
<p>the hall of the Four Courts shall be very empty.'' After the admission
</p>
<p>of Mr.Balfe, as an Arbitrator, was moved, Dr. Gray said, immediately
</p>
<p>before the motion was carried : " I wish to state, before we leave the
</p>
<p>"question of arbitration, that all the necessary documents have been
</p>
<p>" forwarded to the districts where the Arbitrators have been appointed.
</p>
<p>" I recommend the parties not to open the courts until those docu-
</p>
<p><c ments are forwarded." Rev. Mr. Tiemey was present at this meet-
</p>
<p>ing. He made a speech. [Witness read the speech, see ante, page
</p>
<p>141.] Mr. O'Connell then said : " I think this highly respectable cler-
</p>
<p>" gyman deserves the thanks of the Association, I heard his speech
</p>
<p>" with pride and pleasure." That motion was carried by acclamation.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell made some further observations, which the Witness
</p>
<p>read. I attended a meeting of the Association on Monday the 9th
</p>
<p>of October, at Calvert's Theatre, in Lower Abbey-street. Mr. John
</p>
<p>O'Connell was in the chair.

<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hatchell.
</p>
<p>The meeting at Mullaghmast was the first occasion of my coming
</p>
<p>to Ireland. I came over for the purpose of attending that meeting.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell Perhaps I should apprise the Court for whom I
</p>
<p>appear. I am counsel for Mr. Ray, but I shall ask the Witness some
</p>
<p>general questions. With regard to the other traversers, my learned
</p>
<p>friends will ask whatever questions they may consider necessary.
</p>
<p>I mention this, lest it should be supposed that I am cross-examining
</p>
<p>the witness on behalf of all the traversers.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon.  It may be right to mention, that although each
</p>
<p>of the traversers have a right to cross-examine the Witness, that right
</p>
<p>will not be exercised, except with regard to matters relating to some
</p>
<p>of the traversers individually.
</p>
<p>Cross-examination resumed I have been professionally a Re-
</p>
<p>porter, but not for thepublic Press. My business is that of a short-hand
</p>
<p>157
</p>
<p>writer. I never was a reporter for a public journal. I have attended
</p>
<p>public meetings in England to report the proceedings at them. From
</p>
<p>an early period of my life I pursued that profession. I was particu-
</p>
<p>larly employed in England to come here as a Government Reporter. I
</p>
<p>was uot apprised of any meeting, but received general orders to come
</p>
<p>over. My orders were to come over here for the purpose of reporting,
</p>
<p>subject to such directions as I might receive. On my arrival I had a
</p>
<p>letter given to me, addressed to the Attorney General. On applying
</p>
<p>at the Attorney General's house, I was told that he was not at home,
</p>
<p>and I was directed to go to Mr. Brewster. This was late on Saturday,
</p>
<p>the 30th of September. We had a very long passage, and did not
</p>
<p>arrive in Dublin until ten o'clock at night. The meeting at Mullagh-
</p>
<p>mast was the next day. It was eleven o'clock before I went to
</p>
<p>Merrion-square. I stopped at Gresham's Hotel that night. I told
</p>
<p>the waiter to order a car, or a fly, to go to Mullaghmast early the
</p>
<p>next day. An assistant came over with me, and accompanied me to
</p>
<p>Mullaghmast. I did not see the Crown Solicitor before I went.
</p>
<p>I got to Mullaghmast about twelve o'clock. I had no person with
</p>
<p>me but the assistant whom I brought over. He was to assist me in
</p>
<p>transcribing my notes. He attended the meeting. He is a very
</p>
<p>good Reporter himself ; I brought him to transcribe my notes. I have
</p>
<p>no doubt he took a note ; I believe he took a note of it. His name
</p>
<p>is Leatham. I cannot say if he is to be a witness. He came over
</p>
<p>and returned with me on my first visit to Ireland ; he also came over
</p>
<p>with me at the time I was examined before the Grand Jury.
</p>
<p>I have no doubt he will be examined, but I do not know it for
</p>
<p>certain. He took a note. I believe he has transcribed some
</p>
<p>portions of it. No other person came over with me but Leatham.
</p>
<p>He lives in London. Neither he nor I are in Mr. Gurney's Office.
</p>
<p>On our way to Mullaghmast, we stopped at Naas. When we
</p>
<p>arrived at Mullaghmast, there were a few persons on the ground,
</p>
<p>scattered here and there. I was there about an hour and three
</p>
<p>quarters before Mr. O'Connell arrived. There was a platform on
</p>
<p>the ground. I got on it. I had a good view of the people assembled.

</p>
<p>The different parties came to the ground from distant parts, with
</p>
<p>their bands playing. I heard nothing about their being temperance
</p>
<p>bands. I think there might be two or three bands. I cannot say
</p>
<p>that they were temperance bands ; I did not ask nor care. I formed
</p>
<p>no opinion as to their being temperance bands ; all I can say is,
</p>
<p>that there were bands there. I think one or two of the flags had
</p>
<p>inscriptions of "temperance." I saw other banners with mottoes. I have
</p>
<p>attended meetings in England, but never saw any banners or mottoes
</p>
<p>except in the time of Queen Caroline. I never attended any county
</p>
<p>meetings in England; I have attended Chartist meetings at Man-
</p>
<p>chester, in the Carpenters' Hall. I never attended a meeting in
</p>
<p>the open air. I never attended meetings of reformers in 1831 and
</p>
<p>1832. I was then commencing reporting. I was then practising
</p>
<p>for myself as a Reporter. The meetings at the Carpenters' Hall,
</p>
<p>at Manchester, were the only public meetings that I ever attend-
</p>
<p>ed. There was a number of women and children in the crowd at
</p>
<p>158
</p>
<p>Mullaghmast. The assembly was of a perfectly peaceable character
</p>
<p>throughout. I saw no tendency to riot, disturbance, or disagreement
</p>
<p>among (he people themselves. When the Queen's name was men-
</p>
<p>tioned it was always received with the loudest applause and demon-
</p>
<p>strations of loyalty. I recollect, after Mr. O'Connell's arrival, it being
</p>
<p>mentioned that I was on the platform as Government Reporter. I
</p>
<p>was not introduced to Mr. O'Connell, but he mentioned that he
</p>
<p>understood that there was a Government Reporter present. I said
</p>
<p>I attended there on the part of the Government. He then directed
</p>
<p>that every facility and accommodation should be afforded me for the
</p>
<p>purpose of reporting. He did not shake hands with me on that oc-
</p>
<p>casion. Subsequently I had that honour. Afterwards I got a ticket
</p>
<p>for the banquet. Mr. Leatham was there too. There was no secret
</p>
<p>about the matter at all. A great number of persons, respectable in
</p>
<p>appearance, were at the banquet. The banquet commenced at five
</p>
<p>o'clock, and was over at nine. I went away a few minutes before it
</p>
<p>broke up. The same order, regularity, and good conduct were ob-
</p>
<p>served by the persons there as at the meeting. I saw persons called
</p>
<p>the O'Connell police about the platform at the meeting. It appeared
</p>
<p>to me that they prevented persons from getting on the platform, and
</p>
<p>kept the passage to it clear. I think persons would have been
</p>
<p>much incommoded unless there had been some such persons to pre-
</p>
<p>vent the crowd from getting on the platform. I think it very proper
</p>
<p>there should be such persons, and they appeared to me to have the
</p>
<p>effect of keeping order. I did not return to Dublin that night. I
</p>
<p>returned to Naas. I did not transcribe my notes that night. I
</p>
<p>transcribed but a small portion of my report in Ireland. The Queen's
</p>
<p>health was given at the dinner. It was received with very great ap-
</p>
<p>plause, and is marked as such in my report. The health of Prince
</p>
<p>Albert was given after the Queen's. That was given by the Chair-
</p>
<p>man, Mr. John O'Connell. I have a note of the manner in which
</p>
<p>it was received. It was received with great applause. It was before
</p>
<p>that, the letters of excuse for non-attendance were read by Dr.
</p>
<p>Gray. I have a note of different persons from whom they were re-

</p>
<p>ceived. I have a note of a letter from Dr. Mac Hale, signed John
</p>
<p>Archbishop of Tuam. I believe that letter was read. A copy of it
</p>
<p>was handed to me. I took no short-hand note of it. I have no
</p>
<p>doubt I got copies of several of those letters. Several of them I got
</p>
<p>from the newspapers. Mr. Ray threw the copies on the table. There
</p>
<p>were several of them. [Read a letter from Dr. Mac Hale.] I have
</p>
<p>not a letter from Mr. Talbot. I have a letter from the Right Rev.
</p>
<p>John Cantwell (dated September 28th, 1843). I have a note of a
</p>
<p>letter from the Right Rev. James Keating having been read. I have
</p>
<p>only one other letter read at the Mullaghmast meeting. I should
</p>
<p>say that when I applied for copies of these letters, and the resolu-
</p>
<p>tions passed, I was referred by the parties to published letters in the
</p>
<p>newspapers,
</p>
<p>Mr. HalcheU.  Look at that paper and say, whether Dr. Keat-
</p>
<p>ing's letter was read.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  What paper is that ?
</p>
<p>159
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell.  The Freeman's Journal of the 2nd of October.
</p>
<p>Cross-examination resumed.  I cannot from notes or memory
</p>
<p>give the substance of Dr. Keating's letter, but to the best of my
</p>
<p>opinion it was read. I have not Lord .Ffreneh's letter. I have one
</p>
<p>signed Thomas Ffrench. I have a note of a letter having been read
</p>
<p>from Lord Ffrench.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell State the number of letters read, and the names
</p>
<p>of the persons from whom they were received.
</p>
<p>Witness.  There was one signed Michael Boylan, dated Hill-town
</p>
<p>House, 27th September, 1843, and another dated Liverpool, 28th Sep-
</p>
<p>tember, 1843, and signed Patrick Farrell. I will not undertake to
</p>
<p>say that all these letters were read. When copies were refused to me,
</p>
<p>I took them in their order from the newspapers several days, in the
</p>
<p>course of the week, after the meeting. To the best of my belief they
</p>
<p>were read. I have a note of a letter from Sir Colman O'Loghlen
</p>
<p>having been read ; another from Thomas Ffrench ; another dated from
</p>
<p>Castle Ffrench ; one from Mr. Keating, a Town Commissioner of Long-
</p>
<p>ford ; one from Dr. Cantwell, and one from Dr. Mac Hale. I have
</p>
<p>not a note of a letter from Colonel Baker. Many letters were read,
</p>
<p>I have no doubt, which I did not take clown ; having been promised
</p>
<p>copies, I did not pay much attention to them. I considered that
</p>
<p>all the letters read would be handed to me. There was a motto
</p>
<p>hanging up in the Pavilion, " A nation of nine millions is too great
</p>
<p>to be dragged at the tail of any nation." I do not recollect having
</p>
<p>read that motto in the Morning Chronicle. In consequence of
</p>
<p>the situation I hold in reporting at committees of the House of
</p>
<p>Commons, I do not read papers of either side. I never attended
</p>
<p>trades meetings. I never was a member of an institution for the
</p>
<p>encouragement of native manufacture. I did not go to White's in
</p>
<p>Thomas-street to fit myself with a cap. I do not understand
</p>
<p>anything about puffing, direct or indirect. I have no doubt it is
</p>
<p>is a very good way of advertising. I would have no objection to
</p>
<p>encourage native manufacture. If I got a cap to fit me I would wear
</p>
<p>it. I did not get a cap like Mr. O'Connell, although I admired it.

</p>
<p>I am not aware that gentlemen coming from Paris return with tri-
</p>
<p>coloured caps, as comfortable to sleep in. I have seen various caps.
</p>
<p>I did not form any opinion whether there was high treason in that
</p>
<p>cap of Mr. O'Connell's. I was Irish enough to buy something in
</p>
<p>Ireland, and of Irish manufacture. I bought a tabinet for the ladv.
</p>
<p>I do not know but I would have taken a lady for the tabinet if I had
</p>
<p>been disengaged. I left Ireland on the 17th or 18th of October. I
</p>
<p>attended on the 2nd of October at the Association. I was accom-
</p>
<p>modated there ; and received every courtesy, kindness and atten-
</p>
<p>tion from all present. There were some speeches made there which
</p>
<p>I have not read. I have an observation of a person of the name of
</p>
<p>Lanktree, before a letter from Tullow, signed Denis Jackson, was
</p>
<p>read. I have the passage about the Donegal meeting. I have the pas-
</p>
<p>sage referring to West Canada. Mr. O'Connell at Mullaghmast had on a
</p>
<p>robe ; I understood it was as Lord Mayor of Dublin. [The witness
</p>
<p>read Mr. O'Connell's speech on 9th of October, at Abbey-street Thea-
</p>
<p>tre]. I was in Dublin five or six days after the Clontarf meeting I was
</p>
<p>160
</p>
<p>aware of the Clontarf meeting. I went there by general directions ;
</p>
<p>I was to attend all the meetings at the Exchange, and all the monster
</p>
<p>meetings. I was aware of the proclamation. I received no direc-
</p>
<p>tions to go to Clontarf. I went from curiosity. I did not report
</p>
<p>anything which took place there. There was no meeting. I saw
</p>
<p>nothing there but troops, and a few persons who were there from
</p>
<p>curiosity as I was myself. I was not at the Corporation at all. I
</p>
<p>do not think I heard any thing said at the Corn Exchange of the pro-
</p>
<p>cession having been altered so as not to interfere with divine service.
</p>
<p>I first applied to Mr. Ray for documents, he answered that he was
</p>
<p>not Secretary of the meeting at Mullaghmast, otherwise he would
</p>
<p>have given them ; and then I made the application to Dr. Gray.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Moore, as Counsel for the Rev. Mr.
</p>
<p>TlERNEY.
</p>
<p>On the 3rd of October, I saw Mr. Tierney at the Association.
</p>
<p>I did not know him before. I never saw him before. I went about
</p>
<p>twelve o'clock, and remained to the conclusion of the meeting, at
</p>
<p>about four or half-past four. I have no doubt two or three hundred
</p>
<p>persons were there. There were not many speeches. Speeches
</p>
<p>were made by several who are not now on their trial.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Mac Donagh, as Counsel for Mr. Barrett.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett, at the Mullaghmast dinner, spoke to the toast of " The
</p>
<p>People." On the 3rd of October, there were present Mr. John
</p>
<p>O'Connell, Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Steele, The Rev. Mr. Tierney, Dr.
</p>
<p>Gray, Mr. Duffy, Mr. Ray. Mr. Barrett was not there. I made
</p>
<p>a mistake with regard to Mr. Barrett.
</p>
<p>The fact is, that Mr. Barrett was not at all at that meeting? He
</p>
<p>was not.
</p>
<p>And, of course, did not deliver a speech ? He did not.
</p>
<p>You were at a dinner at the Rotunda? I was.
</p>
<p>Am I to assume that Mr. Barrett was not there ? He was not.
</p>
<p>And that he, therefore, made no speech there ? He did not  I
</p>
<p>mistook somebody else for him on those occasions.
</p>
<p>You stated, I think, that at the earliest opportunity you corrected

</p>
<p>the mistake ? I did.
</p>
<p>Were you at Judge Burton's house when the informations were
</p>
<p>about to be sworn ? I was.
</p>
<p>Did you see Mr. Barrett there? I did.
</p>
<p>Did you, on that occasion, depose to the informations? No, it
</p>
<p>was on a prior occasion ; I swore an affidavit on one day, and swore
</p>
<p>an amended one on a subsequent day.
</p>
<p>Do I understand you to say, that you corrected this mistake about
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett, by an affidavit subsequently sworn ? I did not.
</p>
<p>Did you see Mr. Barrett in the act of being held to bail on the
</p>
<p>informations which you had previously sworn? I was present on
</p>
<p>that occasion.
</p>
<p>Did you see him subscribe the recognizance ? I did.
</p>
<p>Did you then correct the mistake ? I did so as soon as I had an
</p>
<p>opportunity. I mentioned it to Mr. Rae and to Mr. Kemmis. Mr.
</p>
<p>1GI
</p>
<p>Rae was in the room, and Mr. Kcmmis was reading ihe recogni-
</p>
<p>zances. Immediately on their leaving the room, I said that I had
</p>
<p>made a mistake as to Mr. Barrett being at the Rotunda or at Ab-
</p>
<p>bey-street Theatre. I spoke to Mr. Rae, Mr. Kemmis's managing
</p>
<p>clerk.
</p>
<p>Did you then apprise those persons of the mistake? I said that
</p>
<p>I had a doubt about Mr. Barrett.
</p>
<p>When ? On that occasion.
</p>
<p>Where ? I believe when we were leaving Judge Burton's house.
</p>
<p>Did you and Mr. Kemmis go back and correct the affidavit ? No.
</p>
<p>What did Mr. Kemmis say ? I cannot remember.
</p>
<p>How far was this from the Judge's door ? We were coming from
</p>
<p>it over to Kildare-street.
</p>
<p>It was before you reached Mr. Kemmis's house, I presume ?
</p>
<p>Yes. We were on our way there.
</p>
<p>Can you not recollect what Mr. Kemmis said on that occasion ?
</p>
<p>I cannot.
</p>
<p>Did he say it was too late to correct the mistake ? No.
</p>
<p>He did not make any observation ? I do not remember that he
</p>
<p>did.
</p>
<p>And the matter was left there ? Yes.
</p>
<p>You mentioned it to Mr. Rae ? I did.
</p>
<p>Was that at the Judge's house ? In the passage, as we were
</p>
<p>leaving the room.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett was then leaving the house ? He was.
</p>
<p>What did you say to Mr. Rae ? That I had been mistaken
</p>
<p>with regard to Mr. Barrett, and that I doubted whether he was at
</p>
<p>the Rotunda or at Abbey-street Theatre; that I heard his name, and
</p>
<p>had mistaken the person.
</p>
<p>What did Mr. Rae say ? I do not remember.
</p>
<p>You did not return to correct the error ? I put him in posses-
</p>
<p>sion of the error ; I was not aware that the identity of Mr. Barrett
</p>
<p>would be left to me ; I was satisfied that although he was not at
</p>
<p>Abbey- street Theatre, that he was at Mullaghmast. I believe I cor-

<p>rected the mistake as to Mr. Tierney's Christian name, three days
</p>
<p>after. The other mistake remained altogether uncorrected.
</p>
<p>You did not apprize Mr. Barrett of it? I did not know where
</p>
<p>to find Mr. Barrett.
</p>
<p>Was it not three days after that, you corrected the affidavit as to
</p>
<p>Mr. Tierney ? It was on that occasion.
</p>
<p>The affidavit had been sworn two or three days before? Yes.
</p>
<p>When you returned from the Judge's house you corrected the
</p>
<p>mistake as to the Christian name of Mr. Tierney ? It was.
</p>
<p>And you then spoke to the Crown Solicitor of the mistake as to
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined % Mr. Whiteside on behalf of Mr. Duffy.
</p>
<p>I saw Mr. Duffy hand in money at Calvert's Theatre, on the
</p>
<p>9th of October. I cannot say whether he went away immediately
</p>
<p>after or not. It was a dark stage, with candle and daylight mixed

<p>together, which made it very hard to see. I was on the platform at
</p>
<p>Mullaghmast. I reported all that occurred there to the best of my
</p>
<p>skill and ability. I was in London at the time of the great meeting
</p>
<p>about the Dorchester labourers, when Dr. Wade paid a visit to
</p>
<p>Lord Melbourne, accompanied by about 200,000 men. I was in
</p>
<p>Parliament-street. I saw Dr. Wade in his robes. The people
</p>
<p>marched in procession over Westminster-bridge. I never saw so
</p>
<p>many people together in my life. There were more than 100,000,
</p>
<p>I should rather say 200,000. I attend Committees of the House
</p>
<p>of Commons. I do not attend debates ; I only attend Committees.
</p>
<p>I was going to ask you whether the Irish peasantry, or the Eng-
</p>
<p>lish gentry in Parliament are the best behaved? The people at
</p>
<p>Mullaghmast were very quiet and well-conducted.
</p>
<p>There was no coughing or shuffling of feet ? No.
</p>
<p>Now are not the House of Commons very noisy and ill-mannered,
</p>
<p>and do not they keep bad hours? I cannot say that. I never heard
</p>
<p>Oastler speaking. I received the letter of introduction to the At-
</p>
<p>torney General from Mr. Gumey. It was on the 9th of October
</p>
<p>that I saw Mr. Duffy hand in the money.
</p>
<p>Re-examined by the Solicitor-General.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ray said he was not Secretary of the meeting at Mul-
</p>
<p>laghmast. I applied to him in his character of Secretary of the
</p>
<p>Repeal Association. He told me he was not Secretary of the
</p>
<p>Mullaghmast meeting. I saw Mr. Barrett at Mullaghmast. I had
</p>
<p>reason to doubt the correctness of my statement when I saw Mr.
</p>
<p>Barrett at Judge Burton's house, on the occasion of the recognizances
</p>
<p>being taken. I was there to amend an affidavit as to the Chris-
</p>
<p>tian name of Mr. Tierney. The affidavit for that purpose had
</p>
<p>been prepared before I discovered the mistake as to Mr. Barrett.
</p>
<p>When I saw Mr. Barrett I knew him to be the gentleman I saw at
</p>
<p>Mullaghmast. I have the address which was presented to Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell, on the 9th of October, at Calvert's Theatre.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell.  I submit to your Lordship that no part of the de-
</p>
<p>bate, statement, or transaction can be read now. The Crown were

<p>Fleming Mathias Leatham sworn, and examined by Mr. Ben-
</p>
<p>nett, Q. C.
</p>
<p>I know Mr. Hughes. I follow the same business as he does. I
</p>
<p>came to Ireland with him. I came as his assistant. I was at the
</p>
<p>Mullaghmast meeting with him. I have been ten years engaged in
</p>
<p>reporting. I went to assist Mr. Hughes to transcribe his notes. I
</p>
<p>transcribed the report from his short-hand note-book. He took the
</p>
<p>notes in short-hand and I transcribed them at his dictation, as he
</p>
<p>stated them. 1 have seen Mr. Hughes in London. I took notes my-
</p>
<p>163
</p>
<p>self for my own amusement at Mullaglimast. I did not take full
</p>
<p>notes. My sole object was to assist Mr. Hughes. He is a particular
</p>
<p>friend of mine, and I wished to come over and see the country. I
</p>
<p>copied some resolutions in short-hand which were thrown on the
</p>
<p>table by Mr. Ray at the banquet. I attended on Monday, the
</p>
<p>2nd of October, at the Association. Mr. Hughes got two cards
</p>
<p>from Mr. Ray, and by that means we got admission. I got one of
</p>
<p>these from Mr. Hughes, and he got it from Mr. Ray. [The card
</p>
<p>was produced, and was similar to that produced by Mr. Hughes,
</p>
<p>the former witness].
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fitzgibbon.
</p>
<p>Those were the resolutions in substance which were read at
</p>
<p>Mullaghmast. The papers afterwards went round the reporters, from
</p>
<p>one table to another, and I saw no more of them. I read news-
</p>
<p>papers after the meeting.
</p>
<p>Did they contain the resolutions ?
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General objected to the question.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon then withdrew the question.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mb. Moore.
</p>
<p>I got a card from Mr. Hughes. I understood Mr. Ray to have
</p>
<p>given the cards. He was informed, to the best of my belief, that I
</p>
<p>was with Mr. Hughes, and he must have known him to be a Govern-
</p>
<p>ment Reporter, for he saw him at Mullaghmast. He gave direc-
</p>
<p>tions to admit me and Mr. Hughes.

</p>
<p>ment, to take notes of Mr. O'Connell's speech at the Donnybrook

<p>not say what became of it. I took a transcript of it. I carried the
</p>
<p>original to London, and kept it in a drawer for a fortnight after I
</p>
<p>took it. I then put it into a cupboard, with other papers, and it
</p>
<p>was lost. I searched for it where I originally placed it. I have
</p>
<p>a transcript of this note. It is very correct. I took it the next day.
</p>
<p>I attended the meeting also for a newspaper. I was connected with
</p>
<p>a newspaper. I should wish to explain, if I am permitted, for I
</p>
<p>have been misrepresented, and I reserved what 1 had to say on the
</p>
<p>subject to this occasion.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn objected to any explanation being given by the Witness.
</p>
<p>Examination resumed When here I took reports for a news-
</p>
<p>paper. I have a copy of my notes of Mr. O'Connell's speech at
</p>
<p>Donnybrook. He spoke of the physical force of the parties who sur-
</p>
<p>rounded him, at the commencement of the speech. |~The Witness

</p>
<p>read the speech. See ante, p. 89.] I formed an opinion of the numbers
</p>
<p>who were present. I thought about 40,000. I was on the scaffold or
</p>
<p>the hustings. I mean the same place as Mr. O'Counell was. I saw
</p>
<p>bands at the meeting. The people came with the bands in pro-
</p>
<p>cession. There were also a great number of flags. I do not recol-
</p>
<p>lect the mottoes on them. I saw Mr. O'Connell come on the
</p>
<p>ground. He arrived about 2 o'clock. I saw nothing particular car-
</p>
<p>ried before him. There was much confusion. The meeting did not
</p>
<p>last more than two hours. I wrote this note the next day, and went
</p>
<p>the day after to England. I returned in August. I saw Mr. John
</p>
<p>O'Connell at the meeting, but I do not recollect that I saw any other
</p>
<p>of the traversers. I did not attend any meeting of the Association
</p>
<p>in July. I attended one in August shortly after my return, on the
</p>
<p>28th of August. I have not on my notes who was in the chair on that
</p>
<p>occasion. I did not get in until after the chairman had been ap-
</p>
<p>pointed. Mr. John O'Connell is the first name I have on my note
</p>
<p>on that occasion. I attended several other meetings, and I usually
</p>
<p>saw at them Mr. O'Connell, Mr. John O'Connell, Mr. Steele, and
</p>
<p>Dr. Gray. I have seen Mr. Duffy there, but not more than twice.
</p>
<p>I am sure I saw him twice. Mr. Ray acted as Secretary. I have
</p>
<p>a note of Mr. O'Connell' speech on the 28th of August. I got some
</p>
<p>papers from Mr. Kay. I got this printed paper from Mr. Ray, as
</p>
<p>Secretary, on the 27th of September. He always distributed those
</p>
<p>papers at the table. I got the other paper the same day. [Other
</p>
<p>papers handed up]. I got this from Mr. Ray. The printed one was
</p>
<p>given by Dr. Gray, on the 16th of October.
</p>
<p>Sergeant Warren.  My Lords, these are all papers relating to

<p>the Arbitration Courts.

<p>Examination resumed I got other papers on the 3rd of Octo-
</p>
<p>ber, a letter of the 2nd of October, signed Patrick Skerrett. There
</p>
<p>is no address on it. I received that from Mr. Ray, on the same
</p>
<p>day. I was at a meeting of the Association at the Corn Exchange,
</p>
<p>on the 4th of September. I did receive a document on 13th Sep-
</p>
<p>tember, not from Mr, Ray, but in the copying-room from one of the

</p>
<p>Illumination of Chavlles Ross continued by Sergeant Warrev.
</p>
<p>I was present at a meeting of the Repeal Association on the 28th
</p>
<p>of August. I saw there Mr. O'Connell, Mr. John O'Connell, and Mr.
</p>
<p>Ray. I have a note of Mr. O'Connell's speech, in which he adverted
</p>
<p>to a plan for the restoration of the Irish Parliament. [The Witness read
</p>
<p>the speech. See antc,\). 111]. Mr. O'Connell referred to a letter which
</p>
<p>had been received from Mallow. I have no copy of this letter. Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell proposed that the letter should be referred to a committee,
</p>
<p>to inquire whether any change should be made in the plan, with re-
</p>
<p>ference to that town. I was at the As30ciati.n on the 29th of August,
</p>
<p>165
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell was there, and made some observations on the Queen's
</p>
<p>speech, in reference to the maintenance of the Union.
</p>
<p>To Mr. Henn. I did not take full notes of all that occurred,
</p>
<p>I only took notes of what I considered material. They are short-
</p>
<p>hand notes.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn,  I submit, my lords, he is not entitled to read those
</p>
<p>notes. He says he did not take a full note of all that passed, he
</p>
<p>only took notes of those parts which to him appeared material. He
</p>
<p>is not to be the judge of the materiality.
</p>
<p>The Loud CUief Justice.  If the witness undertakes to give the
</p>
<p>substance of what was spoken, according to his judgment, that surely
</p>
<p>would be sufficient. If every note was to be taken verbatim et lite-
</p>
<p>ratim, no note would be admissible.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn.  My Lords, I require the substance of all that passed ;
</p>
<p>and the Reporter has no right to exercise his judgment as to what is
</p>
<p>material and what is not. I do not want a verbatim note, but a sub-
</p>
<p>stantial note.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Burton.  Suppose no notes had been taken at all,
</p>
<p>but that the witness came to give evidence as to what he heard stated
</p>
<p>by certain persons, would not that be admissible, although he might
</p>
<p>not remember every word that had passed ? If he had them in his
</p>
<p>memory, surely that would still be evidence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn.  My Lord, that would be a different case. But if a per-
</p>
<p>son goes there deputed by the Government to take a note of the entire
</p>
<p>proceedings, and only produces garbled extracts, I submit that would
</p>
<p>not be evidence ; we are entitled to the whole of what passed there.
</p>
<p>Sergeant Warren.  [To theWitness.J  Have you taken a note, to
</p>
<p>the best of your skill and judgment, of the entire of Mr. O'ConnelPs
</p>
<p>speech on that occasion ?
</p>
<p>Witness I have ; I believe I have the entire ; I can always tell
</p>
<p>when I have taken a thing consecutively, and when I have taken only
</p>
<p>the heads of the subject.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn.  I object, my Lord, to this witness going on. He
</p>
<p>swears he did not take all the speech.

</p>
<p>Sergeant, Warren.  If I do not mistake, he swore he had taken a
</p>
<p>full note. [To the Witness.]  Have you taken the entire of that
</p>
<p>speech? I know I have, because it is all consecutive. I can always
</p>
<p>tell when I have taken only a branch of a speech.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn.  Now tell me, are those full notes, or loose abstracts
</p>
<p>of them ? I cannot depose to a fact of which I know nothing.
</p>
<p>Sergeant Warren,  Look at your note-book, and say if you have
</p>
<p>taken an entire note of Mr. O'Connell's speech on that occasion or
</p>
<p>not ? I do not think I have a full note of all that occurred that
</p>
<p>day ; but I have taken such a note as enables me to give a descrip-
</p>
<p>tion of it.
</p>
<p>Sergeant Warren,  I submit, my Lord, we are entitled to have
</p>
<p>this evidence ; and it will be then for the jury to say how they will
</p>
<p>receive it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin.  Did you observe the last answer the wit-
</p>
<p>ness has given ? He says he did not take a full note of the speech ;
</p>
<p>but such a note as would enable him to give a description.
</p>
<p>166
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn.~ And I submit that is not evidence ; because he can-
</p>
<p>not say anything except what is in his notes, and he admits he did not
</p>
<p>take a full note of the speech.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice.  Let us take down his answer correctly, and see
</p>
<p>what it is. What is your answer?
</p>
<p>Witness.  I find I have not taken a full note. I have taken a
</p>
<p>full short-hand note of all matters which I considered important in
</p>
<p>the speech ; and then when I come to a passage, as for instance, a
</p>
<p>description of the evils the country had suffered from the Uuion,
</p>
<p>such as the falling off of trade, &c, of this I took a note, but not so
</p>
<p>full a note as of the other parts.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  As I understand you, you take a ver-
</p>
<p>batim note of some parts of a speech, and of others you give merely
</p>
<p>a summary ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  Then you cannot give the words of
</p>
<p>those parts of the speech which you took what you call a summary of ?
</p>
<p>I would not pretend to do so. I will give you an example, my Lord.
</p>
<p>[The Witness read an extract from his notes : " ' There is another
</p>
<p>" bill of indictment against the English Government.' Read the ad-
</p>
<p>" dress of the Irish members. That was the address of Mr. Smith
</p>
<p>" O'Brien and other Irish members. Commented on it :  ' Such was
</p>
<p>" the state of Ireland at the commencement of the last session. What
</p>
<p>" was done ? An inquiry was refused. The Welsh committed crimes ;
</p>
<p>" they are rewarded by an inquiry. The Irish committed no crimes ;
</p>
<p>" an inquiry was denied to them ; and the Arms Bill is inflicted on
</p>
<p>" them.'"J Now these are what I call heads of two or three sen-
</p>
<p>tences ; but they are pretty full ones.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice  Do you take upon you to swear, to
</p>
<p>the best of your skill and judgment, that notes, such as you have
</p>
<p>read, contain the substance of what was said, though they are not the
</p>
<p>words used ? Certainly.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  If I understand you right, you say you took a ver-
</p>
<p>batim note of what you considered material? Yes.
</p>
<p>But of those matters which you did not consider material you

</p>
<p>took a summary ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Now do you venture to swear, that of those parts which you did
</p>
<p>not consider material, you have taken fully the substance ? Yes, the
</p>
<p>topics.
</p>
<p>I do not mean by substance, merely taking a note of the topic,
</p>
<p>I ask you whether you have taken the substance of what Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell said in the discussion of the topics ? I have not taken
</p>
<p>a full note of the substance ; I could supply the substance of the com-
</p>
<p>ment from memory.
</p>
<p>Did you not, within the last five minutes, swear that you could
</p>
<p>not ? Particular words, certainly, I did, but not the substance.
</p>
<p>Are you able to swear positively that you can depose to the sub-
</p>
<p>stance of the comments? To the general substance, certainly. I
</p>
<p>cannot pretend with regard to the passages, to give anything like the
</p>
<p>precise language used by Mr. O'Connell.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  Will you take upon yourself to swear to the sub-
</p>
<p>stantial meaning of the comments ? Yes, of the topics.
</p>
<p>167
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn.  That will not do.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor General.  There is a preliminary question to he
</p>
<p>settled before the discussion goes further. Suppose the witness
</p>
<p>admitted most unequivocally, that he could not give either the sub-
</p>
<p>stance or the language of the several parts of a speech, yet I would
</p>
<p>have a right to get from him what the speaker did say. I never
</p>
<p>heard it contended that it is not competent to prove that certain lan-
</p>
<p>guage was used by a person on a particular occasion, because the
</p>
<p>witness is not able to depose to all that was said by that person from
</p>
<p>the beginning to the end of his speech. I will venture to say no
</p>
<p>such proposition is to be found in any law book. The evidence may
</p>
<p>be subject to observation to the jury, or if they can impeach it by a
</p>
<p>reporter, let them do so, but let them not exclude what we can give,
</p>
<p>because we cannot give the whole of the speech.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  I do not controvert what the Solicitor General has
</p>
<p>laid down. The witness only produced the notes to refresh his
</p>
<p>memory, the notes themselves are not evidence. If a written pub-
</p>
<p>lication were given in evidence, they might read a part of it, but
</p>
<p>what I submit is, that when a witness takes a partial note only of
</p>
<p>the proceedings, he is not entitled to use that note, but must depend
</p>
<p>on his memory.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  Do you confine your objection to
</p>
<p>the parts of the speech to which the witness only took a topical note,
</p>
<p>or do you extend it to the parts of which he has a full note?
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  I object to his reading the note at all, unless it is a
</p>
<p>full note.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  Unless some authority can be shown
</p>
<p>for it, the Court will admit the evidence, it being in correspondence
</p>
<p>with all known law which can be found upon the subject.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton  We admit so much of the evidence as
</p>
<p>the witness has a full note of, or to the substance of which he is able
</p>
<p>to swear.
</p>
<p>[The Witness read the speech]. This speech concluded with a
</p>

<p>motion was agreed to. I took no memorandum whether there was
</p>
<p>approbation or disapprobation of that speech. I was present at the

<p>Association on the 4th of September. Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Ray,
</p>
<p>Mr. John O'Connell, and Mr. Steele were present. Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>spoke of the intended meeting at Clontarf. [The Witness read Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell's speech, see ante, p. 117.] I attended the meeting allu-
</p>
<p>ded to in Mr. O'Connell's speech. It took place at Loughrea, on the
</p>
<p>10th of September, Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Steele, Dr. Gray, and Mr.
</p>
<p>Barrett were present. I took a note of what Mr. O'Connell said. [The
</p>
<p>Witness read the speech. See ante, p. 120], I formed an estimate
</p>
<p>that there were about 12,000 persons present. I have made a mis-
</p>
<p>take ; I saw no person but Mr. O'Connell at that meeting. I was pre-
</p>
<p>sent at the dinner ; Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Steele, Mr. Barrett, and Dr.
</p>
<p>Gray were there. [He was here called on to identify those parties].
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  When any of the traversers are stated to have
</p>
<p>been present on any occasion, I will mention it if we mean to dispute
</p>
<p>their identity ; on this occasion we do not dispute the identity.

<p>[The Witness here read Mr. O'Connell's speech at the dinner.

<p>See ante, p. 121.]. I was at a meeting of the Association at the Corn
</p>
<p>Exchange on the 15th of September.
</p>
<p>Witness  Am I to speak from my notes or from my own recol-
</p>
<p>lection ?
</p>
<p>Serjeant Warren.  Speak from your own knowledge, if you can
</p>
<p>speak positively.
</p>
<p>I have only Mr. O'Connell in my notes ; but Mr. Ray, and Mr.
</p>
<p>John O'Connell were there. I have a note of Mr. O'Connell's speech
</p>
<p>on that occasion. [The Witness read the speech, and a copy of
</p>
<p>the " Address to the people of the British Empire," which was passed
</p>
<p>on that occasion].
</p>
<p>" Fellow Subjects,  The people of Ireland would anxiously
</p>
<p>" desire your sympathy and support. But long and painful expe-
</p>
<p>" rience has taught them not to expect either the one or the other.
</p>
<p>" Confident, however, in their own exertions, they content them-
</p>
<p>" selves with laying before you a simple statement of some of the
</p>
<p>" grievances under which their country labours  yet have no other
</p>
<p>" hope, as far as you are concerned, than that of vindicating them-
</p>
<p>" selves in the eyes of all rational and just men amongst you, for
</p>
<p>" the magnitude of the struggle they are now making in the cause of
</p>
<p>" their country.
</p>
<p>" There is no truth more undeniable than this, that England has
</p>
<p>" inflicted more grievous calamities upon Ireland, than any country
</p>
<p>" on the face of the earth besides has done upon any other. In the
</p>
<p>" history of mankind there is nothing to be compared with the
</p>
<p>" atrocity of the crimes which England has perpetrated on the Irish
</p>
<p>" people ; nor as yet has the spirit which created and animated
</p>
<p>" such crimes been much mitigated, if mitigated at all, from its
</p>
<p>" original virulence. The consummation of such crimes, up to the
</p>
<p>" close of the last century, is to be found in the atrocious manner
</p>
<p>" in which the Legislative Union between both countries was ef-
</p>
<p>"fected.
</p>
<p>" The hypocritical pretext under which that Union was offered

</p>
<p>H to the Irish was  that the people of both countries should be
</p>
<p>tf identified into one  that the two countries should be amalgamated
</p>
<p>" into one nation  that there should be no longer any difference of
</p>
<p>''rights or privileges between the English and Irish ; but, on the
</p>
<p>" contrary, that the people of both countries should be placed upon a
</p>
<p>" footing of perfect equality in law and in fact, without any unfa-
</p>
<p>" vourable distinction towards the one, or undue preference to-
</p>
<p>" wards the other. Such was proclaimed by the British Govern-
</p>
<p>" ment to be the intent and meaning of the Act of Union, and such,
</p>
<p>" in point of common sense and of honesty, the Union, if fairly
</p>
<p>" worked out, ought to be.
</p>
<p>" But the exact reverse is the case. The promises held out by
</p>
<p>" the English Government were shamelessly and totally violated.
</p>
<p>" Every pre-existing evil was, by means of the Union, continued
</p>
<p>" and aggravated, and no opportunity has been omitted to inflict new
</p>
<p>" and severer grievances upon this unhappy country.
</p>
<p>169
</p>
<p>" The manufactures, which hefore the Union flourished in very
</p>
<p>" many of our cities and towns, have been annihilated in most, and
</p>
<p>" continued only in a few, and with diminished productiveness. The
</p>
<p>" productive commerce of Ireland has been put down, and in its room
</p>
<p>' there has been substituted the export of the prime necessaries of
</p>
<p>" life, the produce of our fertile soil ; exported, however, not to bring
</p>
<p>" any return to Ireland, but to be disposed of for the payment of the
</p>
<p>" rents of absentee landlords  rents to be expended in foreign lands,
</p>
<p>" and for the exclusive benefit of strangers.
</p>
<p>" Another destructive branch of our remaining foreign commerce,
</p>
<p>" consists in the conveyance from our shores of our hardy population,
</p>
<p>" who, having no employment at home in their own naturally fertile
</p>
<p>" and teemingly fruitful soil, are compelled to seek a livelihood in
</p>
<p>' foreign countries, and to enrich by their productive labour any
</p>
<p>" country but their own.
</p>
<p>" The consequences are obvious ; widely spread pauperism has
</p>
<p>u covered the land, and the Commissioners of Poor Law Inquiry have
</p>
<p>" authenticated the awful fact, that more than 2,385,000 of the people
</p>
<p>" are, some for the entire, and others for at least a portion of the year
</p>
<p>" in a state of absolute destitution.
</p>
<p>" Under the protection of the Irish parliament Ireland was the
</p>
<p>" least taxed country in Europe ; whilst, under the iron rule of the
</p>
<p>" British legislature, it is a universally admitted fact, that Ireland is,
</p>
<p>" in proportion to her means, the most heavily taxed country on the
</p>
<p>" face of the globe.
</p>
<p>" The agricultural interests of Ireland also bear comparatively
</p>
<p>" greater burthens than the agriculture of any other nation  burthens
</p>
<p>" exclusively confined to the land ; they are these :  the tithe rent-
</p>
<p>" charge exceeds half a million of pounds sterling per annum, the
</p>
<p>" Grand Jury assessments, in a great part compulsory, amount to near
</p>
<p> 1,500,000 of pounds sterling per annum, and the poor rates on lands
</p>
<p>" will very soon amount to more than another million sterling per an-
</p>
<p>M num  all, all payable out of the land alone.

<p>" ment, affords facts that show the most fearful destitution of the peo-
</p>
<p>" pie of Ireland. It is shown that more than one-half of the rural po-
</p>
<p>" lation, and one-third of the town population, are living in the lowest
</p>
<p>" state, namely, in a cabin or single room. It is also shown that there
</p>
<p>" is a second class, very nearly in the same proportions, and but little
</p>
<p>" removed in comfort from the first or most destitute, leaving for a
</p>
<p>" class that may be said to enjoy anything like comfortable circum-
</p>
<p>u stances, only 16 per cent, in the rural, and 30 percent, in the town
</p>
<p>" districts. Thus there are 84 per cent, of the rural population in
</p>
<p>" woful want, and 70 per cent, of the civic population in equal distress.
</p>
<p>" Attend to those facts, fellow-subjects ; weigh them well, and see
</p>
<p>" whether there be, on the face of the earth, woe equal to ours.
</p>
<p>" These terrific truths, indicative of great suffering, are authenti-
</p>
<p>" cated by the Government Commissioners, upon whose unquestion-
</p>
<p>" able authority Ave state them.
</p>
<p>"Another fact, of a still more awful nature, is derived from the
</p>
<p>z
</p>
<p>170
</p>
<p>" same authority  it is, that the population of Ireland has for the
</p>
<p>" last ten years, diminished hy more than 700,000 souls. The hi-
</p>
<p>" deous importance of this statement will be felt, when it is recollected
</p>
<p>" that one great proof of increasing prosperity is found in the due
</p>
<p>" augmentation of the people, whilst the most decisive evidence of
</p>
<p>" human misery is found in the fact of a retrograding population. In
</p>
<p>" Ireland that misery is evinced to the extent of an annual retroces-
</p>
<p>" sion of the population of more than 70,000 souls.
</p>
<p>" Such, fellow-subjects, is the general outline of the impoverish-
</p>
<p>" ment of the Irish people, and their sufferings, originating in and
</p>
<p>" continued by the fatal measure of the Legislative Union. Such is
</p>
<p>" the condition of the people of Ireland more than forty years after
</p>
<p>" the Union  such is the authentic picture of the wretchedness of the
</p>
<p>" Irish, after the Union has subsisted near half a century ; the facts
</p>
<p>" derived from the highest and the most reluctant authority, that of
</p>
<p>" Government itself ; a reluctance naturally arising from the obvious
</p>
<p>" truth, that the Government thus doth confess its own crimes  for
</p>
<p>" the misery of the people in a fruitful land must be the crime of the
</p>
<p>" Government.
</p>
<p>" In addition to the physical evils produced by the Union, the
</p>
<p>" misery of Ireland is aggravated by political injury and religious in-
</p>
<p>" suit.
</p>
<p>" These are the aggravations of the wretchedness arising from
</p>
<p>" our physical destitution :
</p>
<p>" Firstly  The great bulk of the Irish people being Catholics, do,
</p>
<p>" even in their impoverished state, cheerfully support a complete
</p>
<p>" hierarchy of their own clergy ; they are impelled by religious mo-
</p>
<p>i: tives to support that clergy, and they do support that clergy out of
</p>
<p>" means that are little better than actual destitution. In the mean
</p>
<p>" time the ecclesiastical temporalities of Ireland, emanating from the
</p>
<p>" bounty of our Catholic ancestors, are dedicated to the mstentation
</p>
<p>11 of the clergy of a comparatively small minority. This grievance
</p>
<p>" would not be endured in England  this grievance would not be
</p>
<p>" borne in Scotland. It is borne in Ireland ; but it is not thereby

</p>
<p>" the less keenly felt by the sensitive and religious Irish people.
</p>
<p>" Secondly  the Representation of Ireland is most unjustly and
</p>
<p>" unfairly disproportioned to the population and resources of Ire-
</p>
<p>" land. At the Union Ireland was compelled to give up two-thirds
</p>
<p>" of her Hepresentatives  Great Britain did not give up a single
</p>
<p>" one. It was an iniquity, without a single ingredient of reciprocity.
</p>
<p>" Ireland gave up 200 members  England not one. If the Union
</p>
<p>" were a bargain, it would be in the nature of a partnership. The
</p>
<p>" man would be only fit for Bedlam, who should become a partner
</p>
<p>" on the terms of annihilating two-thirds of his capital, and receiving
</p>
<p>"nothing in return from his partners. Two-thirds of Irish repre-
</p>
<p>" sentation was confiscated for the profit of England  that is, to
</p>
<p>" enable England to have Ireland at her feet, without adequate
</p>
<p>" power for any protection. The Reform Bill afforded an oppor-
</p>
<p>" tunity to remedy this grievance. There were 220 members which
</p>
<p>" had belonged to the extinguished boroughs, to be distributed
</p>
<p>171
</p>
<p>" between these three countries. Scotland, with a population of
</p>
<p>" little more than two and a hall' millions, got eight in addition to her
</p>
<p>" forty-five. England (then with a population of thirteen millions)
</p>
<p>" took to her own share 207 out of 220 members, and distributed
</p>
<p>" some amongst her great towns, and the far greater part amongst
</p>
<p>" her counties, according to the ratio of their respective population.
</p>
<p>" Ireland, at that time containing more than seven millions ofin-
</p>
<p>" habitants, got an increase of only Jive members.
</p>
<p>" Let us dwell a little upon the complicated enormity of this
</p>
<p>" injustice. Ireland lost by the Union two-thirds of her represen-
</p>
<p>" tation. She ought to have got by the Reform Bill at least from
</p>
<p>" seventy to one hundred additional members, Ireland did get 
</p>
<p>" fully five ! ! Aye, fully five 1 1 t
</p>
<p>" And there are people absurd enough to complain, that the
</p>
<p>tt Irish are discontented  aye, that they are ! ! !
</p>
<p>" Let us recapitulate :
</p>
<p>" England, on thirteen millions, got 207 members.
</p>
<p>" Scotland, on two and a half millions, got eight members.
</p>
<p>" Ireland, on seven millions, got five members.
</p>
<p>" We leave these facts to fester as they are.
</p>
<p>" Thirdly  Our Parliamentary Franchises are wholly inadequate
</p>
<p>* to secure anything like a true reflection of the opinions of the
</p>
<p>" mass of the nation. Two facts will establish this grievance.
</p>
<p>" One of these facts is, that one Riding of Yorkshire has more
</p>
<p>" votes than all the agricultural counties put together of Ireland.
</p>
<p>" The other fact is, that Wales, with a population of 800,000,
</p>
<p>" has more than 36,600 voters, while the county of Cork, ivith an
</p>
<p>" agricultural population of 720,000, has only 2,000 voters.
</p>
<p>" Add to these, that Ireland, from the legal nature of the fran-
</p>
<p> chise, and the technicalities with which it is surrounded, and the
</p>
<p>" power that it gives to the aristocracy to prevent the right to re-
</p>
<p>" gister, the consequences are, that restricted as is the franchise at
</p>
<p>" present, it must day by day become more limited, until it is totally
</p>
<p>" useless for all popular purposes. It is actually in the rapid progress

</p>
<p>" of extinction. If the present system is to prevail, there will shortly
</p>
<p>" be in Ireland no popular franchise at all.
</p>
<p>" Fourthly  The Municipal Reform Bill for Ireland is almost an
</p>
<p>" entire mockery ; and even the few rights that have been left to the
</p>
<p>" reformed Corporations, are confined to the wealthier classes. The
</p>
<p>" pecuniary value of the franchise is so high, as to exclude the great
</p>
<p>" bulk of the population of our towns and cities.
</p>
<p>" In England, the richer country, in the corporate towns and
</p>
<p>" cities, every man rated to the poor rate and borough rate, no
</p>
<p> matter at how low a sum, is a burgess, and entitled to enjoy corpo-
</p>
<p>" rate franchises.
</p>
<p>" In Ireland, the poorer country, no person can be a burgess, or
</p>
<p>" enjoy the corporate franchise, who is not rated to the poor at 10
</p>
<p>" jier annum, or upwards.
</p>
<p>" In England, the richer country, the corporate franchise is
</p>
<p>' enjoyed subject to the payment of two taxes, the poor rate and the
</p>
<p> borough rate.
</p>
<p>172
</p>
<p>" In Ireland for example, in Dublin  the corporate franchise
</p>
<p>" cannot be enjoyed without the payment of nine or ten different taxes
</p>
<p>"or rates.
</p>
<p>" Is there any human being so absurd as to suppose, that there
</p>
<p>" is any thing which ought to be called an Union between countries
</p>
<p>" thus circumstanced?
</p>
<p>" Fifthly  The pecuniary exhaustion occasioned by Absenteeism
</p>
<p>" is one of the mainsprings of all the evils which Ireland suffers.
</p>
<p>" There is no country on the globe in which anything like one-third
</p>
<p>" of the comparative absenteeism existing in Ireland can be found.
</p>
<p>" It would be as well for Ireland, that nine-tenths of the provisions
</p>
<p>" that she exports to England were sunk in the sea, as that they
</p>
<p>" should arrive in safety at the British markets; when sold, no re-
</p>
<p>" turn is made to Ireland, either in money or in goods. The price
</p>
<p>" goes into the pockets of absentees, who spend every shilling of it
</p>
<p>" out of Ireland. No country in the world pays such a tribute to
</p>
<p>" anotber, as Ireland thus pays to England  a tribute creating ex-
</p>
<p>" haustion, poverty, misery, and destitution in all their frightful
</p>
<p>" forms.
</p>
<p>" Sixthly  The connexion between landlord and tenant in Ire-
</p>
<p>" land, arranged as it has been by a long course of vicious legisla-
</p>
<p>" tion, wants that mutual confidence which is essential to the benefit
</p>
<p>" of productive industry. The labouring population, unable to
</p>
<p>" obtain employment, live habitually on the verge of extreme desti-
</p>
<p>" tution. They must obtain land, or they die. The issues of life
</p>
<p>" and death are in the hands of the landlords. The massacres of the
</p>
<p>" clearance system consign to a premature and most miserable grave,
</p>
<p>" hundreds of thousands of victims. They are wholesale murders,
</p>
<p>" followed by the assassination in detail of the instruments of
</p>
<p>" landlord rapacity. These crimes, on both sides, cry to heaven for
</p>
<p>" vengeance and redress ; for a redress, capable of giving to the
</p>
<p>" landlord his just right to adequate rent, and to the tenant just pro-
</p>
<p>" lection for the produce of his labour and capital.
</p>
<p>" Another species of tyranny, the basest and most atrocious of
</p>

</p>
<p>" all, has been recently put in practice by some of the most cruel
</p>
<p>" and bigoted of our landlords; not content with the dominion of the
</p>
<p>" landlord over the tenure and the rent, they insist upon and exer-
</p>
<p>" cise a diabolical despotism over the religion and the conscience of
</p>
<p>" their tenants, and require of them to send their children to schools
</p>
<p>" from which the Catholic clergy are excluded, and in which no reli-
</p>
<p>" gion is taught but that which the parents believe to be false. Thus
</p>
<p>" these landlords usurp a bigoted power over the souls, as well as the
</p>
<p>" bodies, of their wretched serfs. It is only an Irish landlord who
</p>
<p>" could be guilty of this climax of cruelty.
</p>
<p>" The relation between landlord and tenant cannot subsist as it
</p>
<p>" is in Ireland. It is a subject replete with the utmost difficulty.
</p>
<p>" Its solution is filled with dangers. It would require the aid of
</p>
<p>'the honest and feeling portion of Irish landlords, to enable the
</p>
<p>" honest and conscientious friends of Ireland to place the relations
</p>
<p>" between landlord and tenant on a satisfactory footing to both. But,
</p>
<p>173
</p>
<p>alas ! these landlords will not join in our struggle until it is too
</p>
<p>late, and then they will become the principal sufferers.
</p>
<p>" Notwithstanding our connexion with a nation which boasts to
</p>
<p>be the wealthiest, the most enlightened, and most powerful in the
</p>
<p>world, our commerce, our fisheries, our mines, our agriculture, at-
</p>
<p>test by their languishing and neglected condition, the baneful effects
</p>
<p>of English misgovernment.
</p>
<p>" Seventhly  An anti-Catholic and anti-Irish spirit governs the
</p>
<p>distribution of official situations, and has been most painfully ex-
</p>
<p>hibited in the great majority of official appointments made by the
</p>
<p>present ministry.
</p>
<p>" This grievance becomes fearful, when it is recollected that it
</p>
<p>involves the administration of justice. Men who have spent their
</p>
<p>lives in virulent vituperation, and in public hostility to the Catho-
</p>
<p>lics of Ireland, can never give the Irish people any confidence in
</p>
<p>the judicial bench ; and certainly there cannot be any infliction
</p>
<p>greater than to suffer a constant dread of judicial partiality.
</p>
<p>" The magistracy  purged as they are of the friends of Ireland,
</p>
<p>the repealers, are generally of the party hostile to the people. In
</p>
<p>the magisterial bench but little confidence can be placed.
</p>
<p>" Eighthly  The financial robbery of the Irish people by the
</p>
<p>Union, is the most plain and palpable crime ever committed by
</p>
<p>one nation upon another. The Irish owed a debt of twenty mil-
</p>
<p>lions sterling at the Union. Britain owed four hundred and forty-
</p>
<p>six millions sterling. These debts have been amalgamated  a
</p>
<p>fraud, as against Ireland, to the extent of four hundred and twenty-
</p>
<p>six millions of pounds sterling  a gigantic fraud !! !
</p>
<p>" Ninthly  Deep-rooted and increasing discontent pervades the
</p>
<p>entire nation. Feelings of estrangement are rapidly supplanting
</p>
<p>those affections which kindness and justice could have placed at
</p>
<p>the command of Government. Despairing of redress from the
</p>
<p>Legislature, the people of Ireland, confining themselves to legal
</p>
<p>and constitutional means, now rely upon their own strength and
</p>
<p>resolution for the attainment of those rights which they have

</p>
<p>sought from the British Parliament in vain. They know full well
</p>
<p>that they can obtain adequate redress from a domestic legislature
</p>
<p>alone.
</p>
<p>" Tenthly  The voice of the civilized world lays to the charge of
</p>
<p>the English Government the guilt of having produced this exaspe-
</p>
<p>ration of national feeling  this misery, this wretchedness, this ex-
</p>
<p>haustion, this destitution. Upon that Government lies the respon-
</p>
<p>sibility of having failed to secure the welfare and the content of
</p>
<p>the Irish people, and of having, on the contrary, diffused through-
</p>
<p>out the nation, want, and woe, and bitter discontent, and heart-
</p>
<p>rending sorrow.
</p>
<p>" Such, fellow-subjects, are the loud and distinct complaints of
</p>
<p>the people of Ireland. We have applied in vain to the Legislature
</p>
<p>for redress ; our complaints are unheeded, onr remonstrances un-
</p>
<p>availing. The poor boon of inquiry, conceded to the advocate of
</p>
<p>174
</p>
<p>" the Negro and the Hill-Cooly, has been denied to the moral, the
</p>
<p>" temperate, the religious, the brave Irish nation.
</p>
<p>" The black catalogue of grievances which we have thus detailed,
</p>
<p>" instead of being mitigated by hope, or softened by a kind or con-
</p>
<p>" ciliatory deportment, is aggravated and embittered by recent
</p>
<p>" events. The present ministry, instead of giving us redress, insult
</p>
<p>" us with an Arms Bill  an insult which they would not have dared
</p>
<p>" to offer to Scotland, to England, or even Wales. They have fur-
</p>
<p>" ther insulted us by what they are pleased to call an amendment of
</p>
<p>" the Poor Law Bill  an amendment which increases the despotic
</p>
<p>" power of the ruthless Poor Law Commissioners, gives them the
</p>
<p>"appointment of valuators, and takes away the electoral franchise
</p>
<p>" from the poorer classes, without giving them any real relief.
</p>
<p>Lastly, to crown all, they conclude the session with a speech,
</p>
<p>u which tbey cause the Queen to pronounce, of course, the minis-
</p>
<p>" ters' speech, full of sound and fury, giving us for all relief and
</p>
<p>" redress, for all conciliation and kindness, the absurdity of ministe-
</p>
<p>" rial assertion, and the insolence of half-whipped ministerial anger."
</p>
<p>" Fellow-subjects !  our case is before you and before the world.
</p>
<p>" Grievances such as the Irish people endure, no other country has
</p>
<p>" ever suffered. Insults, such as are offered to us, were never in-
</p>
<p>" flicted on any other.
</p>
<p>" There is one consolation : it is admitted by all, and is as clear
</p>
<p>" as the noonday sun  that unless we redress ourselves, we can have
</p>
<p>" no succour from any other quarter ; but we suffice for ourselves and
</p>
<p>" our country  we suffice for the Repeal.
</p>
<p>" We expect nothing from England or Englishmen  from Scot-
</p>
<p>" land or Scotchmen. In each of those countries the benevolent
</p>
<p>" few are overpowered by the anti-national antipathy to Ireland, and
</p>
<p>" the virulent bigotry against the Catholic religion of the overwhelm-
</p>
<p>" ing majority of both England and Scotland. The present Parlia-
</p>
<p>" ment has been packed, with the aid of the most flagitious bigotry,
</p>
<p>" to oppress and crush the Irish nation. From them there is neither
</p>
<p>" redress nor even hope.

</p>
<p>I was at the meeting at Clifden, on the 17th September. 1
</p>
<p>saw there Mr. O'Connell and Mr. Steele. I remember no others
</p>
<p>at the meeting. I recollect seeing Mr. Dillon Browne. I heard him
</p>
<p>make a speech there. I have a note of it. [The Witness read
</p>
<p>the speech]. I heard Mr. O'Connell make a speech there. I have

<p>175
</p>
<p>a note of it. [The Witness read Mr. O'ConnelFs speech, see ante,
</p>
<p>p. 124]. Mr. O'Connell was at the dinner that day. I saw Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell, Mr. John O'Connell, Mr. Steele, Dr. Gray, and Mr. Barrett, at
</p>
<p>the dinner. Mr. John O'Connell was not at the dinner at Clifden.
</p>
<p>I was thinking of the Mullaghmast dinner where Mr. John O'Connell
</p>
<p>presided. The only traversers who were at this dinner were Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell, Mr. Steele, and Dr. Gray. Dr. Gray spoke at the dinner.
</p>
<p>The Queen's health was first given ; then " the People." Dr. Gray
</p>
<p>spoke to this toast. [The Witness read Dr. Gray's speech, and the
</p>
<p>speech of Mr. O'Connell.] I thought there were about 5000 or 6000
</p>
<p>present there. 1 was present at the meeting of the Association, on
</p>
<p>the 27th of September. Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Ray, and Dr. Gray were
</p>
<p>present. Dr. Gray made a report at the meeting, respecting the
</p>
<p>Arbitration Courts. I have not a copy of that. I was furnished
</p>
<p>with some documents. I got a Form of Proclamation.  "Whereas
</p>
<p>u there has been formed for the district of , a Court of Arbitra-
</p>
<p>" tion. Notice is hereby given that Mr. , the Secretary thereto,
</p>

<p>" as may be requisite for the legal commencement of arbitration suits.

</p>
<p>Sergeant Warren Have you any other documents respecting
</p>
<p>Arbitration Courts, which you received that same day ? At the
</p>
<p>meeting of the Repeal Association which was held on the 16th of
</p>
<p>October, I got a document which purports to be a copy of the rules
</p>
<p>and regulations to be observed by Arbitrators, and also by persons in
</p>
<p>various districts of the country who wish to submit their disputes to
</p>
<p>Arbitrators.
</p>
<p>Sergeant Warren.  Read it.
</p>
<p>It was as follows :  " Rules to be observed by Arbitrators in
</p>
<p>" Districts the People whereof may choose to submit their Disputes
</p>
<p>" to Arbitration Powers of Arbitrators. First  Arbitrators will
</p>
<p>" remember that they derive their legal power to adjudicate in any
</p>
<p>176
</p>
<p>" given case, solely from the consent of the disputing parties to sub-
</p>
<p>" mit their disputes to the arbitration and award of Arbitrators, and
</p>
<p>" will therefore be careful never to enter on any case until both
</p>
<p>" parties have consented to submit the cause of dispute to their de-
</p>
<p>" cision. This consent should in general be bad in writing, and the
</p>
<p>" name of the Arbitators, as well as the cause of dispute, should be
</p>
<p>" stated therein. The consent (which is legally called a deed of sub-
</p>
<p>" mission) should then be signed by both parties in presence of a wit-
</p>
<p>" ness. In trivial cases a verbal consent, in the presence of a witness,
</p>
<p>" will suffice ; but, as in the case of a written consent, the Arbi-
</p>
<p>" trators should be named by the disputing parties. Second  It is
</p>
<p>" illegal and an indictable offence for arbitrators to administer an
</p>
<p>" oath. In hearing cases, they will therefore not only not administer
</p>
<p>" an oath themselves, but they will not permit the disputing parties,
</p>
<p>" or their witnesses, or any of them, to take an oath, or use such as-
</p>
<p>" severations as may be deemed or construed into an oath. Neither
</p>
<p>" ought the Arbitrators to take any form of an oath themselves.
</p>
<p>" Third  Arbitrators may, when duly nominated by both the disputing
</p>
<p>" parties, decide and adjudicate in all cases except such as are called
</p>
<p>"felonies, as theft, forgery, passing base coin, and such like. The cases
</p>
<p>" that more properly belong to the province of Arbitrators are such as
</p>
<p>" hitherto chiefly formed the subjects of expensive litigation in the
</p>
<p>"magisterial and other courts. So are wages, debts of all kinds,
</p>
<p>" disputes between employers and the employed  including
</p>
<p>" servants, labourers, and mechanics  trespass, disputes concern-
</p>
<p>" ing mearings  claims on foot of alleged damage sustained in any
</p>
<p>" mode whatever, whether by breach of contract or by assault and
</p>
<p>" battery. In cases of assault, the complainant must seek for the re-
</p>
<p>" covery of damage sustained as the result of the assault committed,
</p>
<p>" and the Arbitrators may award to the injured party any amount of
</p>
<p>" pecuniary damages they may deem a just recompense. Fourth  Ar-
</p>
<p>" bitrators are not limited as to the extent of their jurisdiction, as are
</p>
<p>"justices of the peace and assistant-barristers. They may, when
</p>
<p>" duly nominated, adjudicate in cases involving any amount of pro-

</p>
<p>" perty. In all cases, however, over a 20 stamp will be necessary
</p>
<p>" to render the consent (or deed of submission) and award legal ; but
</p>
<p>lt in all cases under that sum, the consent and award require no stamp
</p>
<p>" to render them binding in law. The ordinary schedule of stamp
</p>
<p>" duties, to be had at the office of every vender of stamps, will show
</p>
<p>" the amount of stamp duty required in each case, amounting to,
</p>
<p>" or exceeding 20, and the Arbitrators should direct the dis-
</p>
<p>" puting parties to procure same, and the cost of same should
</p>
<p>" be allowed, in making up the award, to the successful party. 
</p>
<p>" Order of Proceedings.  Fifth  The form of notice from the
</p>
<p>"plaintiff to the defendant should be signed by the plaintiff, and
</p>
<p>" the notification appended thereto, signifying the willingness of the
</p>
<p>" Arbitrators to act, if duly nominated, should be signed by some
</p>
<p>" one of the Arbitrators of the district. Sixth  After the parties have
</p>
<p>" come to the place of holding the Arbitration, and before the plain-
</p>
<p>1T7
</p>
<p>" tiff be allowed to make his statement, the Arbitrators should
</p>
<p>" ascertain whether both parties be present. If they be not, the
</p>
<p>;< hearing must be postponed. But if both parties be present,
</p>
<p>" the Arbitrators will inquire if they mutually consent to submit
</p>
<p>" the cause in dispute to their arbitration. Should both con-
</p>
<p>** sent, then the Arbitrators will follow the directions given in
</p>
<p>" rule No. 1 . Should they, however, not consent, the Arbitrators will,
</p>
<p>" on no account, proceed any farther with the case. Seventh  These
</p>
<p>" parties having indifferently chosen and named the arbitrators, and
</p>
<p>" consented to abide by their decision and award, the arbitrators
</p>
<p>" will proceed to hear the case in manner following:  the plaintiff
</p>
<p>" should be called on to state his case, and having done so, he may
</p>
<p>" be examined by the Arbitrators, and cross-examined by the defen-
</p>
<p>" dant. The witnesses for the plaintiff to be then called, and res-
</p>
<p>" pectively examined by the Arbitrators, and cross-examined by the
</p>
<p>" defendant. The case for the plaintiff having closed, the defendant
</p>
<p>' should then be called upon to make his statement, and having been
</p>
<p>" examined by the Arbitrators, and cross-examined by the plaintiff,
</p>
<p>" his witnesses are to be called, and a similar course pursued to that
</p>
<p>" directed in the case of the plaintiff's witnesses. The case on both
</p>
<p>" sides having closed, the Arbitrators will proceed to make their
</p>
<p>" award, which must in all cases be in writing, and be signed
</p>
<p>" by the Arbitrators named by the disputing parties, and by none
</p>
<p>" others, save the Secretary, who must sign as a witness. When
</p>
<p>" so signed, the award should be publicly read by the Chairman.
</p>
<p>" Note  In all cases of arbitration, the wife or child of either party
</p>
<p>" may be examined ; and a witness may be called a second time
</p>
<p>" should the Arbitrators think fit. It may be advisable, for the pur-
</p>
<p>" pose of eliciting truth, that the witnesses on both sides should be
</p>
<p>" sent out of the room until required for examination. Eighth  The
</p>
<p>" disputing parties, or either of them, should be allowed to have the
</p>
<p>" aid of professional men, if they choose. In such case, the profes-
</p>
<p>" sional agent will state the case, and examine and cross-examine
</p>
<p>" witnesses, instead of the party litigant, as stated in rule seven.

<p>" Ninth  Should the arbitrators find a difficulty in coming to a de-
</p>
<p>" cision in any case, a reasonable time may be taken for making the
</p>
<p>" award ; but it is advisable that, in all cases where it is practicable,
</p>
<p>" the award be made immediately after the hearing.
</p>
<p>" General Rules.  Tenth  The Arbitrators should sit in a room
</p>
<p>" open to the public ; and it is deemed advisable, that all manifesta-
</p>
<p>" tion of approval or of disapproval, by the suitors or audience, be
</p>
<p>" prohibited, as calculated to disturb the proceedings. Eleventh 
</p>
<p>" The Arbitrators will cause the Secretary to make an entry in the
</p>
<p>" minute book, of each case that comes before them. Should there
</p>
<p>" be no appearance to the notice of complaint, or should the case
</p>
<p>" have been settled, he will enter it accordingly ; and should the case
</p>
<p>" be heard, he will enter the particulars under their respective heads.
</p>
<p>" Twelfth  The original deed of submission and the award are to
</p>
<p>" be carefully preserved by the Secretary, as they may be necessary for
</p>
<p>" the future security of the respective parties from further claims. It

</p>
<p>" will be his duty, however, to supply copies of the award, free of ex-

</p>
<p>" A copy of these rules should be posted in some conspicuous place

<p>" in the room where the Arbitrators sit."
</p>
<p>Examination continued.  Arbitrators were appointed for Dun-
</p>
<p>drum. Several persons were appointed Arbitrators. Mr. Nugent
</p>
<p>was appointed for Kingstown, and Dr. Gray was appointed for Dun-
</p>
<p>drum. I attended the Mullaghmast meeting. I have a note of what
</p>
<p>took place there. I heard Mr. O'Connell make a speech.
</p>
<p>Mr. Sergeant Warren.  I wish the Witness to read certain por-
</p>
<p>tions of this speech, but if the counsel for the traversers wish it he
</p>
<p>shall read the entire. It has been already read by a former witness.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn.  If Mr. Sergeant Warren says the reports of both wit-
</p>
<p>nesses correspond, we do not want to have it read, but if they do
</p>
<p>not, we must have it read.
</p>
<p>Mr. Sergeant Warren.  I cannot say they correspond in all
</p>
<p>respects.
</p>
<p>[The Witness then read the speech made by Mr. O'Connell on
</p>
<p>that occasion.]
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Ray, Mr. Steele, and Dr. Gray, were at that
</p>
<p>meeting. I was present at the dinner ; those persons who were pre-
</p>
<p>sent at the meeting were also at the dinner ; Mr. Barrett and Mr.
</p>
<p>John O'Connell were also there. I have an incomplete note of
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett's speech. I have not a note that would give a fair idea
</p>
<p>of what Mr. Barrett said.
</p>
<p>Mr. Macdonagh objected to its being read.
</p>
<p>Mr. Sergeant Warren.  You need not read it then.
</p>
<p>Witness  I have a note of Mr. O'Connell's speech. [The Witness
</p>
<p>read the speech.]
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Henn on the Part of Mr. John O'Connell.
</p>
<p>I came to Ireland the day before the Donnybrook meeting.

</p>
<p>I was never in Ireland before. I was a little frightened at first, but
</p>
<p>I found the alarm false. I was paid 50 for attending at the Donny-
</p>
<p>brook meeting, 350 for the other business. I was arrested for debt
</p>
<p>on the 25th of June last. I was discharged as an insolvent, and my
</p>
<p>petition was heard the 25th of July.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  You said it. was suggested to you on the part of the
</p>
<p>Government to come over here. Who suggested that to you?
</p>
<p>Mr. Sergeant Warren objected to the question.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn submitted he was entitled to ask the question, in
</p>
<p>order to test his accuracy.
</p>
<p>Mr. Sergeant Warren  The channels of communication ought not
</p>
<p>to be laid open. It is so laid down in Phill. on Evidence,191, where the
</p>
<p>result of the cases is summed up. In Hardy's case, 24 State Trials,
</p>
<p>808, Lord Chief Justice Eyre says, " It is perfectly right that all op-
</p>
<p>" portunities should be given to discuss the truth of the evidence given
</p>
<p>" against a prisoner, but there is a rule which has universally obtained
</p>
<p>179
</p>
<p>" on account of its importance to thepublic for the detection of crimes,
</p>
<p>" that those persons who are the channels by means of which that
</p>
<p>" detection is made, should not be unnecessarily disclosed."
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn.  There is a distinction between the cases. If it had
</p>
<p>not arisen on the other side on the direct examination, I should not
</p>
<p>be at liberty to go into the inquiry as to the name of the person. In
</p>
<p>the case referred to, the question arose on the cross-examination.
</p>
<p>This is a question arising on the direct examination ; and how can I
</p>
<p>test the accuracy of his answer, unless I am allowed to ask the ques-
</p>
<p>tion ?
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  The Court are all of opinion, that
</p>
<p>the distinction taken by Mr. Henn makes no difference. The protec-
</p>
<p>tion must be upheld.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn then proceeded with the cross-examination. You had
</p>
<p>a communication with a person high in office ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Shortly before you came from England, were you in connexion
</p>
<p>with any newspaper? Yes, the Morning Chronicle.
</p>
<p>How long in connexion with that paper ? About three years.
</p>
<p>Does it support the present Government ? No.
</p>
<p>Were you in connexion with any other paper ? Not at that
</p>
<p>time.
</p>
<p>Were you at any other time ? Yes ; the Times.
</p>
<p>When did your connexion with the Times cease? In 1836.
</p>
<p>When with the Morning Chronicle ? After the last session of
</p>
<p>Parliament.
</p>
<p>Since then, have you been engaged by any paper ? Yes, by the
</p>
<p>Standard.
</p>
<p>Then, when you came here in July were you not connected with
</p>
<p>the Morning Chronicle? Yes; I wish to state the reasons why I
</p>
<p>came.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn.  You have already given 350 substantial ones for
</p>
<p>coming.
</p>
<p>Witness.  If I had not come as a newspaper reporter I would not
</p>
<p>come for anything.

</p>
<p>Would you not come for 100,000 ? Oh ! I might ; or 75,000.
</p>
<p>Why, would it be so hard to tempt you? I was led to appre-
</p>
<p>hend some danger.
</p>
<p>Well, now that you have come over, would you entertain the
</p>
<p>same apprehension ? Now that I have seen how things are carried
</p>
<p>on, I would not have the same apprehension.
</p>
<p>Having been deputed by some one high in office, and while
</p>
<p>in the employment of the Morning Chronicle, you came to Ireland?
</p>
<p>Yes.
</p>
<p>Well, to whom did you apply on your arrival ? You came here
</p>
<p>to report the proceedings at the meeting held at Donnybrook ; you
</p>
<p>could not report unless you had a place on the platform to hear and
</p>
<p>see ; tell me to whom did you apply ? I do not know.
</p>
<p>How did you get to the meeting ? I went there with a gentle-
</p>
<p>man connected with the Dublin Evening Post ; he, being well known,
</p>
<p>did everything for me, and got me a place on the platform. I did
</p>
<p>180
</p>
<p>not interfere at all. I got a place on the platform. That, gentleman,
</p>
<p>is the correspondent of the Morning Chronicle. He is not con-
</p>
<p>nected with the Government. I did not communicate to him that I
</p>
<p>was deputed to come over by the Government.
</p>
<p>You said when Mr. O'Connell arrived there was great confu-
</p>
<p>sion ? Yes.
</p>
<p>That was created by persons coming on the platform ? It was.
</p>
<p>There was no breach of the peace, no alarm on your part? No.
</p>
<p>You would not give 50,000 to get away from it ; was not all
</p>
<p>quiet and decorous ? It was.
</p>
<p>The report of what occurred at Donnybrook you transcribed from
</p>
<p>the notes you took ? Yes.
</p>
<p>, Have you that paper ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Now, having come over in a double capacity, did you furnish a
</p>
<p>report to the Government and to the Morning Chronicle ? Yes, I
</p>
<p>assisted in preparing a report for the Morning Chronicle.
</p>
<p>Was that on the same day ? Yes, it was on Monday, 3rd July.
</p>
<p>Did you on that day copy the short-hand notes you took to fur-
</p>
<p>nish your report to the Chronicle ? Oh no, I sent it off by post that
</p>
<p>night, and it was not more than thirty lines ; I only wrote a portion
</p>
<p>of Mr. O'Connell's speech, without referring to my notes at all.
</p>
<p>When did you write out the report for Government? On the
</p>
<p>next day.
</p>
<p>Is it a full report ? As full as possible, except in those portions
</p>
<p>to which I have referred.
</p>
<p>I understand you took a verbatim report of what you considered
</p>
<p>material ? Yes.
</p>
<p>You cannot be always precisely verbal ? Oh no, and the change
</p>
<p>of a word might often make a very material difference in the sense of
</p>
<p>a sentence.
</p>
<p>But of those parts you did not consider material you did not
</p>
<p>take a note ? No.
</p>
<p>You took what you call topical notes of what took place ? Yes.
</p>
<p>But you do not pretend to say that you even gave the substance

</p>
<p>of what was said in those topical notes ? I do not understand the
</p>
<p>latter portion of your question. I took notes in such a way as not
</p>
<p>to misrepresent the sense of the speaker upon those points on which
</p>
<p>he spoke ; but I do not pretend to have given the words, or any-

<p>thing like them.
</p>
<p>Do you pretend to say you have given even the substance of
</p>
<p>the observations made on the various topics? I do not know how
</p>
<p>far the expression " substance" extends.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn Why, substance is substance, and it is so plain a
</p>
<p>word that it could not be made plainer. Did you give the substance?
</p>
<p>I gave the substance or meaning of the observations.
</p>
<p>Of all the observations? Oh no.
</p>
<p>What then ? The discussion of these topics might have occu-
</p>
<p>pied twenty sentences ; but those twenty sentences might express
</p>
<p>but one idea, and I only put down the idea.
</p>
<p>What are topical notes ? The substance of the observations
</p>
<p>made on the various topics alluded to.
</p>
<p>181
</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Ross, having escaped from the savages, and got back
</p>
<p>to London, you got courage to come back again ? Yes, I came back.
</p>
<p>Were you not under the same alarm then, as at first ? Yes, I
</p>
<p>was ; I had experience of only one meeting then ; but it was not
</p>
<p>in the neighbourhood of Dublin that I was afraid ; I entertained
</p>
<p>apprehensions at first.
</p>
<p>Were you then in the employment of the Chronicle? No.
</p>
<p>Did you come as a reporter for Government ? No, I came as a
</p>
<p>reporter for the Standard.
</p>
<p>Not on the part of the Government ? Yes, on the part of the
</p>
<p>Government also.
</p>
<p>Who recommended you to the Standard? Myself.
</p>
<p>Were you known before? Every person connected with the
</p>
<p>press knows me in London.
</p>
<p>You know Mr. Bond Hughes, then ? No, I have not the plea-
</p>
<p>sure of knowing Mr. Hughes.
</p>
<p>He knows you ? Only by reputation.
</p>
<p>Did you see him here? Yes.
</p>
<p>Your reputation recommended you to the Standard? I did not
</p>
<p>say it in that way, but I believe it was my reputation that recom-
</p>
<p>mended me.
</p>
<p>Having been thus recommended to the Standard, you came
</p>
<p>here on the part of the Standard and the Government, and with
</p>
<p>that intention you attended several meetings of the Association ? I
</p>
<p>attended three monster meetings, and several at the Association.
</p>
<p>Now, will you tell me how you got access to the Association ?
</p>
<p>Was it your reputation introduced you there ? No ; it was either
</p>
<p>the gentleman who went with me to Donnybrook, or another gentle-
</p>
<p>man from the same establishment.
</p>
<p>Did you tell him you were connected with the Standard?
</p>
<p>Yes.
</p>
<p>And with the Government ? No ; I did not want to tell him
</p>
<p>that I was connected with the Government.
</p>
<p>You saw Mr. Hughes at Mullaghmast ; did he know you per-

</p>
<p>sonally ? Yes ; he was, I am told, in my company about seven years
</p>
<p>ago, at an entertainment given to a gentleman.
</p>
<p>Did you send reports to the Chronicle ? I sent reports of three
</p>
<p>public meetings to the Chronicle.
</p>
<p>When you came here, did you come from the Standard, and
</p>
<p>Chronicle, and the Government ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Did you send reports to the Standard, Chronicle, and the
</p>
<p>Government ? I did, to the Standard and Chronicle, but not to
</p>
<p>the Government ; I wrote the report out here.
</p>
<p>Did you not transmit reports to London ? Yes, to the Stand-
</p>
<p>ard and Chronicle.
</p>
<p>The Standard is a Government paper ? I never disclosed the
</p>
<p>fact that I was here on the part of the Government, until last night.
</p>
<p>May be you stated that you had come here for the Chronicle
</p>
<p>alone? Oh ! is it I ? I never stated a falsehood in my life, and it
</p>
<p>is too late now to begin.
</p>
<p>Did you tell the truth when you stated you would not take
</p>
<p>182
</p>
<p>50,000 to come here ? I say so. I did not state at all that I came
</p>
<p>here on the part of the Government ; there is one with whom I am
</p>
<p>connected, I mean my wife, whose wishes and feelings I always con-
</p>
<p>sult, and she was averse to my coming here as a Government Report-
</p>
<p>er ; I had my own feelings too on the matter. A young artist who
</p>
<p>had been asked to come here to exhibit a celebrated picture, re-
</p>
<p>fused to do so; and when a gentleman of education entertained ap-
</p>
<p>prehensions on the matter, some allowance must be made for my
</p>
<p>having a reluctance to state why I came.
</p>
<p>Well then, I take it for granted that you would not undertake the
</p>
<p>business for 50,000 ? You did not communicate that you came
</p>
<p>here on the part of the Government to the Morning Chronicle? No.
</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Ross, you attended the Loughrea, Clifden, and Mul-
</p>
<p>laghmast meetings, did you send reports of the proceedings at each
</p>
<p>to the Chronicle ? I did not send the report of the Mullaghmast
</p>
<p>meeting to the Chronicle.
</p>
<p>You took notes ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Who supplied the Chronicle ? Mr. Geary.
</p>
<p>Are you acquainted with him ? Well.
</p>
<p>Did you compare notes? No.
</p>
<p>You did not transmit the report to the Chronicle? No.
</p>
<p>Having attended at those monster meetings here, may I ask you
</p>
<p>whether you have ever, in the course of your duties in England, at-
</p>
<p>tended at any of the great public meetings there ? Not at many,
</p>
<p>but at some of them.
</p>
<p>At any of the Anti-Corn-Law League meetings ? No, I never
</p>
<p>reported any of them.
</p>
<p>Do not you think it very wrong that a Reporter should be called
</p>
<p>upon to give evidence? No, certainly not. I think a Reporter should
</p>
<p>obey the law of the country, and I never heard that questioned until
</p>
<p>I heard it by some gentlemen here. It is preposterous.
</p>
<p>You were not always merely a Reporter? No.
</p>
<p>You were, I believe, an Editor? I was.
</p>
<p>I was the Editor of the Carlisle Patriot from 1837 to 1839. It

<p>is of Conservative politics. 1 have not always been a Conservative,
</p>
<p>for the term has only existed about ten years.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn.  Of what politics are you ?
</p>
<p>Witness. 
</p>
<p>" In moderation placing all my glory,
</p>
<p>Some call me Whig, and others call me Tory."
</p>
<p>I have been denounced by some members of my family, who are Li-
</p>
<p>beral, for being Tory, and I have been blamed by my Tory friends
</p>
<p>for being too Liberal.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn.  Perhaps both were right ?
</p>
<p>Witness.  Perhaps they were ; you can only arrive at a mean by
</p>
<p>the assertion of two opposites.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn.  You tell us more than we poor Irish knew before.
</p>
<p>Witness  When I was Editor of the Carlisle Patriot I had no he-
</p>
<p>sitation in professing Conservative politics; because they were pro-
</p>
<p>fessed by persons with whom I generally agreed. If you asked me
</p>
<p>163
</p>
<p>what I was before the Reform Act I should say I was a moderate
</p>
<p>Whig. I never had a touch of a Radical about me. I have had a
</p>
<p>leaning to Liberal principles, which all young men have, and which is
</p>
<p>the inevitable result of reading.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henri.  I hope you will inspire the Government with similar
</p>
<p>views ? I do not think it necessary. None of the present Govern-
</p>
<p>ment were connected with the Carlisle Patriot. I did not know any
</p>
<p>of the proprietors of it except from their own statement. I remem-
</p>
<p>ber the trial of a person of the name of Taylor at Carlisle. I do not
</p>
<p>remember giving evidence at that trial. If I did it must have been
</p>
<p>about some unimportant matter, as I do not recollect it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  I suppose it was a topical note which you did not con-
</p>
<p>sider material ? I took no notes of it. It was an examination before
</p>
<p>the magistrates.
</p>
<p>Were you examined before the magistrates ? No.
</p>
<p>Did you not protest, on the high privilege of a Reporter, that you
</p>
<p>should not be examined ? Certainly not. I did not take an active
</p>
<p>part in the elections in England. I did not always confine myself to
</p>
<p>the drudgery of reporting during my connexion with the Press. I
</p>
<p>have occasionally written articles. I am not aware of ever having writ-
</p>
<p>ten an election squib ; but if any one is shown to me I will say imme-
</p>
<p>diately whether I wrote it or not. I do not remember Mr. Went-
</p>
<p>worth standing for Carlisle. I do not remember the placard which
</p>
<p>has been handed up to me. Nor the name of the candidate which is on
</p>
<p>it. I never saw or heard of him before. I was not in Carlisle in 1841.
</p>
<p>I left it in January, 1840. I was connected with the London papers
</p>
<p>in 1841. If there was a contested election at Carlisle in 1841 I must
</p>
<p>have heard of it ; but I never heard who the candidates were. There
</p>
<p>was an election at Carlisle, for the county, in 1839 or 1840. I never
</p>
<p>saw the placard that has been handed to me before. I was Editor of
</p>
<p>the Carlisle Patriot in 1838. I have not the slightest recollection
</p>
<p>of this placard, but it might have appeared in my own paper. -I can-
</p>
<p>not say whether it did or did not. I was there three years then.
</p>

<p>" protest, in the strongest manner, against the conduct of the magis-
</p>
<p>" trates, in compelling us to give evidence against the prisoners."
</p>
<p>Do you remember those words? No.
</p>
<p>Mr. Sergeant Warren.  The witness has already stated that he
</p>
<p>has no recollection of having seen that document before, and there-
</p>
<p>fore you have no right to read a word of it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn.  I am entitled to ask whether this was inserted in the
</p>
<p>paper with his sanction.
</p>
<p>The Court ruled against the question.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn.  Will you swear you did not, when Editor of the
</p>
<p>Carlisle Patriot, protest against Reporters being examined ? No ;
</p>
<p>not even in the sentence which you have read.
</p>
<p>Which you have written ? Which you have read.
</p>
<p>What is your opinion now ? I never heard the question discussed
</p>
<p>until this trial. I have been in the habit of reporting in the House
</p>
<p>184
</p>
<p>of Commons. I have often reported Mr. O'Connell's speeches. I
</p>
<p>found difficulty in following him. Almost all Reporters find difficulty
</p>
<p>in following Mr. O'Connell. I do not think it would be easier to
</p>
<p>report a passage in the House of Commons than at a public meeting,
</p>
<p>and for this reason, that at a public meeting you are much nearer to
</p>
<p>the speaker. At Donnybrook all was quiet and peaceable. So at
</p>
<p>Clifden, Loughrea, and Mullaghmast. I saw numbers of men coming
</p>
<p>with their wives, and numbers of the cavalry without saddles or
</p>
<p>bridles. I was not frightened, because my character was not known.
</p>
<p>I was sure that I was quite safe near the traversers on the scaffold,
</p>
<p>so I always kept there. All the speakers spoke from the scaffolding.
</p>
<p>I think scaffolding is the proper word. It is hustings at an election.
</p>
<p>It was wet at the Clifden Meeting, but not so wet as to interfere
</p>
<p>with reporting. We had an umbrella over us. I was able to take
</p>
<p>notes pretty fully. I attended the Association on the 4th of Sep-
</p>
<p>tember. There were a great many persons there besides the tra-
</p>
<p>versers. The room would hardly hold as many as this Court. The
</p>
<p>dinners were well attended.
</p>
<p>Did you see, at any of those meetings, any of the traversers do
</p>
<p>any thing inconsistent with the duty of a peaceable citizen ? No.
</p>
<p>Was there a tendency to a breach of the peace ? No.
</p>
<p>I took a note of a speech of Mr. O'Connell's on the 4th of Sep-
</p>
<p>tember, before the one I read. I have not got the note of what he
</p>
<p>said after reading a letter from Dundalk, with regard to a man of the
</p>
<p>name of Callan. I have a report of some observations of Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell, about Ribbonism, just after Dr. Gray's speech. He said that
</p>
<p>efforts were making to extend the Ribbon system among the people 
</p>
<p>that it was the duty of the Repeal Wardens to watch all proceedings
</p>
<p>of that nature, and give information respecting them to the magis-
</p>
<p>trates. That was all I considered material. From my recollection
</p>
<p>I think he read a list of names. I have a faithful transcript of what
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell said. Mr. Ray read a letter from a Mr. Napper, in
</p>
<p>reply to a vote of the Association. This was at the meeting of the
</p>
<p>27th of September ; Mr. O'Connell said : " He is a most respectable

</p>
<p>" gentleman, and we cannot hesitate for a moment to place his letter
</p>
<p>" in the minutes. Mr. Napper insinuates that we commenced the
</p>
<p>" attack on the Saxons ; he seems to forget that the severance of the
</p>
<p>'< two nations emanated from the highest quarter. I heard the Lord
</p>
<p>" Chancellor of England state that the Irish were aliens in blood, in
</p>
<p>" language, and in religion. Mr. Connor is no longer a member of the
</p>
<p>" Association, and though I approve of the resolution condemnatory
</p>
<p>" of his notice, I regret he was treated with so much courtesy. I re-
</p>
<p>" gret that he was not taken by the shoulder and put out of the room.
</p>
<p>" If he was honest he would wait until I was present to make such a
</p>
<p>" proposition." Mr. Connor had proposed that the Association should
</p>
<p>agree to a resolution, declaring that rent should not be paid. Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell continued : " He should wait until I was in the room be-
</p>
<p>" fore he brought forward such a proposition. This was due to me,
</p>
<p>" as I am responsible for the legal formation of the Association. But
</p>
<p>" he took advantage of my absence to hold out a topic that would
</p>
<p>185
</p>
<p>" attract attention for a moment from persons who do not consider
</p>
<p>" what would he the result, and hy throwing out a political clap-
</p>
<p>" trap try to make an impression that might be destructive of the
</p>
<p>" Association. I was cautioned against him. He wrote a letter to
</p>
<p>" the Freeman yesterday, in which he assumed a look of injured in-
</p>
<p>" nocence. The question of fixity of tenure is one of great impor-
</p>
<p>" tance. No country was ever prosperous in which it is not the
</p>
<p>" object of men to acquire landed property, and we must* not do
</p>
<p>" anything that would make the landlord's situation cease to be a
</p>
<p>" desirable one. I am ready to do all that the landlord ought to
</p>
<p>" desire, but I am convinced that there must be an end to the pre-
</p>
<p>" sent relation between landlord and tenant. The power of exter-
</p>
<p>" minating must be taken away, and the sacredness of possession must
</p>
<p>" be established." After referring to an account in the Morning
</p>
<p>Chronicle of meetings held in Wales on the subject of tenure, and to
</p>
<p>a speech made by Lord Londonderry, the speech proceeded to the
</p>
<p>following effect : " I now come back to Mr. Connor. Mr. Connor
</p>
<p>" knew that a declaration not to pay rent-charge is against an Act of
</p>
<p>" Parliament, and that a combination not to to pay rent is a direct
</p>
<p>" infringement of the law ; and it is the convictieu of my mind that
</p>
<p>" to a certain extent the safety of the Association depends upon you
</p>
<p>" all declaring with me, that the name of Mr. Connor should not re-
</p>
<p>" main on our books. If he wanted to do us mischief is not that the
</p>
<p>" course he would take ? And shall I be told that he did not in-
</p>
<p>" tend to do us an injury when he took that step ? I declare him
</p>
<p>" a political enemy to the people of Ireland. I will not mince the
</p>
<p>" matter at all."
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell then moved that the letter of Mr. Napper, and
</p>
<p>an extract from the speech of Lord Londonderry should be inserted
</p>
<p>on the minutes, and that the name of Mr. Connor should be ex-
</p>
<p>punged. This motion was carried. Mr. Steele suggested that
</p>
<p>Mr. Connor's money should be returned. I have no report of
</p>
<p>Mr. Steele's speech, nor of Mr. John O'Connell's speech on that
</p>
<p>occasion.

<p>Mr. Justice Perrin.  Did you send a report of the Donny-
</p>
<p>brook meeting to the newspapers ?
</p>
<p>Witness.  No, my Lord, with the exception of a few sentences
</p>
<p>of Mr. O'Connell's speech, which I wrote from memory.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hatchell.
</p>
<p>I think I saw Mr. Ray on the scaffold at Mullaghmast  perhaps
</p>
<p>I should say platform  it is a better word. I also saw him at the
</p>
<p>banquet. I left London first to come to Ireland the day before the
</p>
<p>Donnybrook meeting. I came direct by railway from London.
</p>
<p>I took a warm interest in the Cumberland elections, in 1837, 1838,
</p>
<p>and 1840. I supported the Conservative candidates. There was
</p>
<p>no opposition on that occasion, a brother of Lord Morpeth's was
</p>
<p>returned. I never took part in any election in which Sir James
</p>
<p>Graham was a candidate.

<p>SATURDAY, January 20th.
</p>
<p>John Jackson sworn, and examined by Mr. Brewster.
</p>
<p>I am connected with the London Morning Herald. I was its
</p>
<p>Irish Correspondent in the course of the last summer and autumn, I
</p>
<p>attended the Association meetings in Dublin, and transmitted to
</p>
<p>London regularly, reports of what passed there.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster.  My Lords, I do not mean to make the Witness
</p>
<p>go through ail the speeches that have been already read. I will
</p>
<p>merely ask him who took part in the meetings at which those
</p>
<p>speeches were made. [He handed him a manuscript].
</p>
<p>JVitness.  Those are my original notes, which I sent to London.
</p>
<p>I find there a speech made by Mr. O'Connell, on the 80th of May,
</p>
<p>at the Association. [The Witness read part of the speech], I have a
</p>
<p>note of a meeting at the Association on the 6th of June. Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell, Mr. John O'Connell, Mr. Barrett, and Mr. Steele were
</p>
<p>present on that occasion. [The Witness read Mr. Steele's speech
</p>
<p>and Mr. O'Connell's speech].
</p>
<p>[This meeting not being stated in the bill of particulars, the ex-
</p>
<p>amination of the Witness on that subject was discontinued].
</p>
<p>I attended a meeting of the Association on the 4th of July. Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell, Mr. John O'Connell, Mr. Ray and Mr. Steele were pre-
</p>
<p>sent ; on that occasion, sums of money were handed in from America.
</p>
<p>At a meeting of the 5th July, Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Duffy, Mr.
</p>
<p>John O'Connell. [The Witness read what Mr. O'Connell said, and
</p>
<p>the proceedings of the meeting on that occasion].
</p>
<p>On the 18th of July, I was present at the Association. I saw
</p>
<p>there Mr. O'Connell, Mr. John O'Connell, Mr. Barrett, Mr. Ray
</p>
<p>and Dr. Gray. [The Witness read the proceedings of the meeting
</p>
<p>on that occasion, and what Mr. O'Connell staled].
</p>
<p>On the 25th of July I was present at the Association. Messrs.
</p>
<p>Ray, O'Connell, Duffy, Steele, and John O'Connell were then pre-
</p>
<p>sent. [The Witness read what Mr. O'Connell said]. On the 22nd of

<p>August I was at the Association, and saw there Mr. Duffy, Mr. O'Con-

<p>proceedings of the meeting.] On that day I got a document. It
</p>
<p>is a plan for the renewed action of the Irish Parliament. I was
</p>
<p>at the adjourned meeting of the 23rd of August. Mr. O'Connell,
</p>
<p>Mr. John O'Connell, Mr. Barrett, and Dr. Gray were present. I
</p>
<p>have a note of Mr. O'Connell's speech. [The Witness read the
</p>
<p>speech.] I have also a note of Dr. Gray's speech, in bringing for-
</p>
<p>ward the report of the Arbitration Committee. [The Deputy Clerk

<p>of the Crown read the report of the Arbitration Committee.] Mr.

<p>Steele, Mr. John O'Connell, Mr. Ray, Mr. O'Connell, and Dr. Gray
</p>
<p>were at the meeting of the Association of the 28th. I have a note of

<p>Mr. O'Connells speech on that occasion. [The Witness read the
</p>
<p>speech.] I have a note of the meeting of the 29th of August. Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell, Mr. Ray, and Mr. John O'Connell were present at it.

<p>1ST
</p>
<p>In different parts of Mr. O'Cennell's speech on that day, I have
</p>
<p>marked, "hear, hear, and cheering." I was present at a meeting of
</p>
<p>the Association on the 4th of September; Mr. Hay, Mr. O'Connell,
</p>
<p>Mr. Steele, and Mr. John O'Connell were present. Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>handed in different sums from different parts of Ireland  from Liver-
</p>
<p>pool and America. I have a note of a speech of Mr. Kay, referring
</p>
<p>to the hallads in the Nation, and saying, that the vendors of ballads
</p>
<p>should get such ballads as were published in the Spirit of the Nation,
</p>
<p>and give up the dissemination of the trash which they usually sold.

<p>Mr. O'Connell spoke of the intended meeting at Loughrea. I was
</p>
<p>at a meeting of the Association on the 12th of September. Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell, Mr. Barrett, Mr. Steele, and Dr. Gray were present at the
</p>
<p>meeting on the 12th of September. Mr. Barrett handed in 21
</p>
<p>from a place in Fermanagh. Mr. O'Connell introduced Mr.
</p>
<p>to the meeting, as having brought the last contribution from America.
</p>
<p>Dr. Gray spoke of the arbitration arrangements. [1 he Witness read
</p>
<p>the speech]. I was at the meeting of the 13th September. Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell, Mr. Steele, and Mr. Kay were present. Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>read a letter from Washington in America, signed by W. Tyler.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ray spoke. [The Witness read his speech]. I got a copy of the
</p>
<p>address to the British subjects. [Handed in]. I was at a meeting of
</p>
<p>the Association on the 21st of September. Mr. Ray, Mr. J. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell, and Mr. Duffy were there. Mr. Duffy handed in subscriptions
</p>
<p>from several places in the north. 1 was present at a meeting of the
</p>
<p>Association on the 27th of September. Mr. O'Connell, Mr. J. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell, Mr. Steele, Mr. Ray, and Dr. Gray were there.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster.  Mr. Ross has given evidence of those meetings
</p>
<p>yesterday. I therefore merely wish the Witness to state who were
</p>
<p>present.
</p>
<p>Examination continued.  On the 28th September I attended a
</p>
<p>meeting of the Association. Mr. O'Connell, Mr. John O'Connell,
</p>
<p>and Mr. Ray were there. Mr. O'Connell spoke of the coming
</p>
<p>meeting at Mullaghmast.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore  If the only object be to prove the persons who

</p>
<p>were at the meetings, Mr. Brewster's course is proper. But he
</p>
<p>cannot state what Mr. O'Connell said.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster  Mr. Ross gave no account of the meeting.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore  We wish to take the opinion of the Court as to
</p>
<p>this. It is admitted by this Witness that he has not a full note of
</p>
<p>the speeches. The Crown have no right to read an extract from the
</p>
<p>speech. I do not go the length of" saying that the Witness should
</p>
<p>give evidence of all that passed, but the whole speech should be read.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice  All I want is, that they should
</p>
<p>read every thing which Mr. O'Connell said.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore  That is not the course which has been adopted.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster.  Mr. O'Connell appears to have made at each
</p>
<p>meeting several speeches. When we called on the Witness to read
</p>
<p>any portion of a speech, we asked him to read the whole of it. But
</p>
<p>in this instance we do not wish to hear the speech.
</p>
<p>188
</p>
<p>The Loud Chief Justice.  It would be quite unfair for the
</p>
<p>Crown to give a garbled extract ; but I think Mr. Moore has misun-
</p>
<p>derstood Mr, Brewster.
</p>
<p>Examination continued.  Mr. Steele was at that meeting. I was
</p>
<p>present at a meeting on the 3rd of October. Mr. O'Connell, Mr.
</p>
<p>Steele, Mr. Duffy, Mr. Ray, Mr. John O'Connell, Dr. Gray, and the
</p>
<p>llev. Mr. Tierney, of Clontibret, were there. Many persons attended
</p>
<p>at these several meetings. Sometimes more and sometimes less.
</p>
<p>They were generally well attended.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster.  Have you heard any of the traversers, at any of
</p>
<p>these meetings, say anything of newspapers.
</p>
<p>Mr. JFitzgibbon objected on account of the generality of the
</p>
<p>question.
</p>
<p>The objection was overruled.
</p>
<p>Witness.  I did not.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fitzgibbon.
</p>
<p>I am a Clare man. I have been acting in the capacity of Corres-
</p>
<p>pondent for the Morning Chronicle for two years. I am not a
</p>
<p>short-hand writer. I am not a Reporter, as the term is generally ap-
</p>
<p>plied. I mean by a Reporter a short-hand writer. I was in the ca-
</p>
<p>pacity of a person reporting public proceedings after a manner.
</p>
<p>I began that occupation three or four years ago. I contributed to
</p>
<p>provincial newspapers. I sent reports to the Limerick Star and Li-
</p>
<p>merick Chronicle. The Limerick Star is a Liberal, the Limerick
</p>
<p>Chronicle a Conservative paper. I was first employed for the Star,
</p>
<p>and then for the Chronicle.
</p>
<p>What is your native place ? Kilrush.
</p>
<p>What were the reports which you sent to the Limerick papers ?
</p>
<p>They had no reference to politics ; they were sketches of the Petty
</p>
<p>Sessions.
</p>
<p>Were they illustrated sketches ? A little embellished occasion-
</p>
<p>ally.
</p>
<p>By being a little embellished do you mean that they had pictures ?
</p>
<p>They were pen and ink sketches.

</p>
<p>The embellishments, then, were done with pen and ink ? Yes.
</p>
<p>By embellishments you mean something put into the report that
</p>
<p>had not taken place ? Certainly.
</p>
<p>Something not true ? The half of them were fictions.
</p>
<p>That is what you call reporting after a manner. Then you prac-
</p>
<p>tise as a Reporter by vending falsehoods ? No ; I report on the same
</p>
<p>principles as I would contribute to works of imagination.
</p>
<p>Then you have contributed to works of imagination ? I have
</p>
<p>done so, a little.
</p>
<p>Embellished a little ? Tales of imagination.
</p>
<p>You are a little bit of a poet ? I am.
</p>
<p>You are what is called in Clare, a poetaster ? Yes, if you choose*
</p>
<p>to apply the term.
</p>
<p>Then, you have contributed to publications ; did you ever send
</p>
<p>any to the Nation ? Never.
</p>
<p>189
</p>
<p>To what papers did you send them ? To the papers I mentioned
</p>
<p>before, the Limerick Star and Limerick Chronicle.
</p>
<p>In conformity with the principles of the papers? In nine cases
</p>
<p>out of ten, they had no reference whatever to them.
</p>
<p>To what had the tenth case reference ? To the subjects of the
</p>
<p>day, occasionally.
</p>
<p>Have you contributed to magazines ? I contributed a short tale
</p>
<p>to the University Magazine.
</p>
<p>A false one ? Yes.
</p>
<p>But you intended that it should be believed to be a true one ?
</p>
<p>To the man who would be fool enough to believe it I did.
</p>
<p>Then you intended that it should be believed, if people were
</p>
<p>fools enough to do so ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Now, those illustrated sketches which you sent, as the reports of
</p>
<p>the proceedings at the petty sessions at Kilrush, was it not intended
</p>
<p>that they should appear to be true ? Oh ! yes.
</p>
<p>You intended that they should appear in the public papers as
</p>
<p>true reports? I did.
</p>
<p>And they were not true ? Some were, and some were not.
</p>
<p>When did you cease reporting at Kilrush ? This month two
</p>
<p>years I came up to Dublin.
</p>
<p>How did you prefer to live in Dublin ? I became the Corres-
</p>
<p>pondent of the Morning Herald.
</p>
<p>But you know Dublin is a place where a man must have a little
</p>
<p>income to live.  How do you support yourself? I receive 150
</p>
<p>guineas a year from the Morning Herald, as their Correspondent.
</p>
<p>As a fixed salary ? Yes.
</p>
<p>What have you to do for that ? I send a letter every day hav-
</p>
<p>ing reference to the topics of public interest of the day.  I give a
</p>
<p>summary of the news of the day.
</p>
<p>You read the local papers published in Dublin, and you make a
</p>
<p>summary of what is going on, and send it to the Morning Herald ?
</p>
<p>Certainly, topics of newspaper interest generally.
</p>
<p>Had you the privilege of embellishing those? I had.

</p>
<p>And you exercised that privilege? No, not in matters of truth.
</p>
<p>Is there any truth in what you send to the Morning Herald ?
</p>
<p>Yes there is ; I send any thing in the shape of news.
</p>
<p>And you first come to the knowledge of it from the newspapers ?
</p>
<p>Yes.
</p>
<p>Then you endeavour, on the best authority you can, to discover
</p>
<p>whether what you find in the newspapers is true? I take a great
</p>
<p>deal of it for granted.
</p>
<p>Do you take opinions? What I think not improbable I do.
</p>
<p>Do you go to inquire about the truth of them ? Certainly ; and
</p>
<p>if I saw any absurd or high-flying opinion I should be slow in adopt-
</p>
<p>ing it.
</p>
<p>What mode do you take of ascertaining the truth? General in-
</p>
<p>quiry. From whom ? Any person I happen to meet, where the
</p>
<p>matter is one of conversation ; I try to ascertain whether it is true or
</p>
<p>false.
</p>
<p>190
</p>
<p>Can you tell me any one occasion on which you endeavoured to
</p>
<p>ascertain the truth or falsehood of any statement ? I cannot charge
</p>
<p>my recollection with any particular instance.
</p>
<p>Yet you persevere in swearing that you used to do so ? Yes; I
</p>
<p>cannot call to mind any individual case, but I have done it. I make
</p>
<p>inquiry from some person whom I believe to be a person of truth.
</p>
<p>Are those the notes you took for the Morning Herald ? Yes,
</p>
<p>this is one of my daily letters to the Morning Herald.
</p>
<p>Did you send that identical piece of paper to the Morning He.
</p>
<p>raid ? I did.
</p>
<p>I do not mean the substance of the contents of the paper ; I
</p>
<p>mean the identical papers themselves ? The very identical paper I
</p>
<p>have in my hand, I sent to the Morning Herald.
</p>
<p>For the purpose of being printed in the Morning Herald ? Yes.
</p>
<p>I suppose you know enough of reporting to know that it is ne-
</p>
<p>cessary, in sending manuscript to a newspaper, to write only on one
</p>
<p>side of the paper ? Yes.
</p>
<p>That is part of the instructions to every Reporter ? Yes.
</p>
<p>In order that without being copied they may immediately be
</p>
<p>sent into the printing office to be set up? Yes.
</p>
<p>Were those papers when you sent them to the Morning Herald
</p>
<p>in the same state that they are now ? No ; they were in full length
</p>
<p>scraps, not divided as they are now. When I was short of paper I might
</p>
<p>have tacked a small part to another ; but I never divided them in the
</p>
<p>centre.
</p>
<p>Then they were not divided in that way ? No.
</p>
<p>You received them back from the Morning Herald 1 ? I did not
</p>
<p>receive them.
</p>
<p>After you sent them to the Morning Herald when did you see
</p>
<p>them again ? 1 received a letter from the proprietor of the Morning
</p>
<p>Herald about two months ago.
</p>
<p>I did not ask you what you heard from the proprietor of the
</p>
<p>Morning Herald. I asked you when you saw those papers again,
</p>
<p>after sending them to the Morning Herald ? About two months

</p>
<p>ago ; scarcely two months since.
</p>
<p>In whose hands did you see t.hem ? In Mr. Kemmis's, who
</p>
<p>handed me a letter from the Editor of the Morning Herald.
</p>
<p>You saw them in Mr. Kemmis's hand ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Where was he when you saw them ? He sent for me and I went
</p>
<p>to him.
</p>
<p>Was that the first time you saw them ? It was.
</p>
<p>Whose initials are those ? Mine.
</p>
<p>When did you write them ? In Mr. Kemmis's office a few days
</p>
<p>after that.
</p>
<p>For the purpose of identification ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Had you any communication with Mr. Kemmis before that?
</p>
<p>None whatever.
</p>
<p>Did you expect that communication from Mr. Kemmis ? On my
</p>
<p>oath I did not.
</p>
<p>191
</p>
<p>When did you begin to attend the meetings of the Association?
</p>
<p>I suppose about eight or nine months ago.
</p>
<p>Was that the first time you were there ? No, I was often there
</p>
<p>before.
</p>
<p>May I ask you are you a Repealer? No.
</p>
<p>And you paid a shilling on going in ? The first time I went I
</p>
<p>did.
</p>
<p>Afterwards you went in free ? Afterwards I went in with a young
</p>
<p>man connected with the Press, as a Reporter.
</p>
<p>You tell me these pieces of paper were sent to the Morning
</p>
<p>Herald; were they your own notes? Sometimes they were.
</p>
<p>Were they ever taken from the notes of the man near you ?
</p>
<p>Very frequently.
</p>
<p>You were not able to lake the notes yourself? I am not a short-
</p>
<p>hand writer. Sometimes I was, and sometimes I was not. I might
</p>
<p>have come in late. Twenty things might have detained me.
</p>
<p>Then you sometimes copied from the slips of the short-hand
</p>
<p>writer near you ? I copied them to this extent, that I gave the
</p>
<p>substance of what he had written out.
</p>
<p>This was done while the proceedings were going on ? Yes.
</p>
<p>You copied his long-hand transcript from his short-hand notes?
</p>
<p>Sometimes.
</p>
<p>Did you endeavour to vary it ? Yes.
</p>
<p>That is to vary it so that it should not appear to be a copy of
</p>
<p>what he had transcribed ? Precise^.
</p>
<p>That was for the purpose of making the persons to whom you
</p>
<p>transmitted these papers, believe that you took them down yourself?
</p>
<p>It is a very general custom.
</p>
<p>I am not asking you the general custom, but your particular cus-
</p>
<p>tom ? I have done so often.
</p>
<p>And those are the notes you have been reading here to-day ?
</p>
<p>Yes.
</p>
<p>Now, will you be good enough to take up the notes that you have
</p>
<p>read here to-day, and take any piece of paper that you will particu-

</p>
<p>larly swear was taken down from the lips of the man who is reported
</p>
<p>in it to have spoken ? On my oath Mr. O'Connell made those
</p>
<p>observations.
</p>
<p>Mind, Sir, that was not my question. To the best of your belief,
</p>
<p>did Mr. O'Connell make the observations which are written on that
</p>
<p>paper ? In substance he did.
</p>
<p>On your oath did you write what is in each of those papers while
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell was speaking ? Yes.
</p>
<p>On your oath is that written down on that piece of paper as it fell
</p>
<p>from the lips of Mr. O'Connell ? Yes, to the best of my belief and
</p>
<p>recollection, it is.
</p>
<p>I ask you to fix on any one scrap of paper that you can positively
</p>
<p>swear to ? I swear, to the best of my belief and recollection, but I
</p>
<p>am not positive ?
</p>
<p>Then you are not positive as to that piece of paper ? No.
</p>
<p>What is the date of that ? The 30th of Mav.
</p>
<p>192
</p>
<p>Are you positive at all that that piece of paper was written as
</p>
<p>the words fell from the lips of Mr. O'Connell ? No.
</p>
<p>On your oath was it written while he was speaking, and from his
</p>
<p>lips ? It was spoken when I wrote it out.
</p>
<p>Will you swear it was not taken from another paper ? I will not
</p>
<p>swear to that.
</p>
<p>Then it may have been taken from another paper? This por-
</p>
<p>tion may or may not.
</p>
<p>Might not any man in court have safely answered that it might or
</p>
<p>might not ? I cannot recollect any particular case.
</p>
<p>Then you do not recollect whether it was taken from another
</p>
<p>paper, or from the lips of the man whom you have represented to
</p>
<p>have spoken it ? I cannot.
</p>
<p>Can you fix on any one of those which you will positively swear
</p>
<p>was taken from the lips of the speaker ? I cannot fix on any parti-
</p>
<p>cular one.
</p>
<p>Now, will you take up that paper of the 5th of July. Was that
</p>
<p>made up in the same way as the others ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Was it written while the people who were at the meeting spoke ?
</p>
<p>Yes.
</p>
<p>You swear that ? Yes.
</p>
<p>The whole of that bundle ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Take up one of these slips of paper, and say, on your oath, whe-
</p>
<p>ther that was written while the meeting was going on on that day in
</p>
<p>the Association Rooms ? Every one of these papers was written on
</p>
<p>that day in the room.
</p>
<p>While each particular speaker was speaking ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Do you swear that positively? I must explain.
</p>
<p>No ; give me an answer first. On your oath, do you swear po-
</p>
<p>sitively that every word on every one of these slips was written in the
</p>
<p>Association Room on that day, and while each particular speaker was
</p>
<p>speaking ? Certainly not.
</p>
<p>You told me a while ago, that they were. Turn to Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell's speech on the 5th of July, and read a sentence of it. Do you

</p>
<p>swear that sentence was written down while the speaker was speak-
</p>
<p>ing it ? I cannot be certain whether it or was or was not.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster I object to Mr. Fitzgibbon taking a part of a
</p>
<p>speech and reading it in this way.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon.  I am taking the only legal course, and if I
</p>
<p>adopted any other course, I should be legally and properly stopped
</p>
<p>by the Crown. How does the matter stand ? Here is a man in-
</p>
<p>forming the jury of what took place from memory. He comes here
</p>
<p>to tell the jury that he is a Reporter for a newspaper, and that he
</p>
<p>attended these meetings ; that he heard what Mr. O'Connell said, and
</p>
<p>took it down in writing. The question is, is the Witness to be be-
</p>
<p>lieved ? Is his statement true or false ? I want to show that it is
</p>
<p>absolutely false ; a fabrication from beginning to end. I want to
</p>
<p>show that he is not relying on any paper which he wrote himself, nor
</p>
<p>on memory. I want to show that he comes here falsely representing
</p>
<p>himself to be a Reporter. That he was not able to take notes, and
</p>
<p>193
</p>
<p>that he did not take notes of what passed, that he is giving in evidence
</p>
<p>what he copied the next day verbatim et literatim from newspapers.
</p>
<p>Cross-Examination resumed.  Will you swear that you did not
</p>
<p>take those notes from a newspaper ?
</p>
<p>To the best of my recollection I did not, but I may have copied
</p>
<p>them from the notes of a newspaper.
</p>
<p>Did you copy that sentence while Mr. O'Connell was speaking ?
</p>
<p>I cannot swear positively, whether I did or did not.
</p>
<p>One way or the other you cannot tell me ?
</p>
<p>I cannot tell you at this distance of time.
</p>
<p>Nor whether you wrote it out on the same day ?
</p>
<p>I cannot say.
</p>
<p>May it have been the next day ?
</p>
<p>I cannot be certain.
</p>
<p>Then you may have copied some of those slips from the morning
</p>
<p>papers ?
</p>
<p>I may have copied some of them.
</p>
<p>Is it possible that you did ? It may be so.
</p>
<p>Did you ever copy them from the papers ? I did not copy
</p>
<p>them ; I cut them out of the papers.
</p>
<p>Then did you send over the pieces of the newspapers that you
</p>
<p>cut out ? When 1 adopted them, I did.
</p>
<p>Did you send the paper you hold, to London? I did.
</p>
<p>Will you swear it was not copied from the newspaper ? It is
</p>
<p>very probable it may have been taken from a newspaper, or from the
</p>
<p>notes of a newspaper ; I cannot undertake to swear positively that it
</p>
<p>was not.
</p>
<p>Then those papers may have been copies taken from printed
</p>
<p>newspapers, the day after the meeting ? Or from the notes I took
</p>
<p>on that day ; it may be the one, or it may be the other.
</p>
<p>A Juror.  Did you not swear that, all that was written during
</p>
<p>the time of the meeting at the Corn Exchange?
</p>
<p>Witness.  The majority of them were written during the meet-
</p>
<p>ings at the Corn Exchange.

</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon.  I put the question which the Juror asked you,
</p>
<p>again ; did you not swear that all those papers were written during
</p>
<p>the meetings ? The majority of them were.
</p>
<p>Will you swear that they were all? Some of them were written
</p>
<p>after the meetings broke up.
</p>
<p>Were any of them written the next day ? I cannot tell whe-
</p>
<p>ther they were or were not, some of them were occasionally.
</p>
<p>Did you not take some of them from the morning papers ? I did.
</p>
<p>Did you not say all of them were written during the meeting ?
</p>
<p>I said, generally speaking, all of them were.
</p>
<p>Do you persevere in saying that ? That is what I meant to
</p>
<p>convey.
</p>
<p>You cannot now remember what you said five minutes ago ; I
</p>
<p>did not ask you what you meant to convey ; did you not say that
</p>
<p>they were all taken while the proceedings were going on ? I did
</p>
<p>not say so ; I said generally.

<p>Sometimes you were merely listening ? Sometimes.
</p>
<p>And not taking any note at all ? Sometimes.
</p>
<p>Do you recollect Mr. O'Connell making a long speech about Ne
</p>
<p>gro slavery ? I do.
</p>
<p>Were you present ? To the best of my recollection he spoke
</p>
<p>several times of it.
</p>
<p>Were you present when he spoke of it on the 5th of July ? To
</p>
<p>the best of my recollection I was.
</p>
<p>Were you present at the whole of the meeting ? I rather think
</p>
<p>I was.
</p>
<p>Will you swear positively that you were? I will not.
</p>
<p>Will you swear you were there for an hour? I will.
</p>
<p>For two hours ? To the best of my recollection I was.
</p>
<p>Is that the only answer you will give me ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Will you positively swear that you were there for an hour i To
</p>
<p>the best of my recollection I was.
</p>
<p>Perhaps in making up that hour, you include several attendances?
</p>
<p>When I went there I stayed altogether.
</p>
<p>On that day ? Yes.
</p>
<p>You will not swear that you were there for an hour certainly ?
</p>
<p>To the best of my recollection I was.
</p>
<p>Then you will not swear positively you were there for an hour ?
</p>
<p>I think I was, I did not time myself.
</p>
<p>Then you cannot positively swear you were there for an hour ? No.
</p>
<p>Can you positively swear you were there for half an hour ? I can-
</p>
<p>not.
</p>
<p>Can you positively swear you were there for a quarter of an
</p>
<p>hour ? Oh I can ; I remained there for some time.
</p>
<p>Can you swear that sometime amounted to a quarter of an hour?
</p>
<p>I can, and more.
</p>
<p>How much more? I cannot remember ; it might have been one
</p>
<p>hour, it might have been three. I cannot remember.
</p>
<p>Who was on his legs when you went into the room on any one
</p>
<p>occasion ? If you will allow me, I will read it.

</p>
<p>No. Did you not say that your note might have been taken
</p>
<p>from the morning papers the next day? I did not commit it to
</p>
<p>memory.
</p>
<p>What were they doing when you went into the room ? I cannot
</p>
<p>remember.
</p>
<p>Was any body there on the 5th of July ? I cannot particularly
</p>
<p>remember on any specific day who was there.
</p>
<p>Did you find any body in the room ? There was always some-
</p>
<p>body in the room when I went there.
</p>
<p>Was it in the morning, at noon, or at night ? It was at mid-day.
</p>
<p>What o'clock ? About twelve or one o'clock.
</p>
<p>Did you hear the whole of Mr. O'Connell's speech that day? Yes.
</p>
<p>The whole of it? Not the whole of it.
</p>
<p>Do you positively swear that you went to the Association at
</p>
<p>twelve or one o'clock that day, and that you heard Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>speak ? Yes.
</p>
<p>195
</p>
<p>Will you swear that you were there till after two? I cannot say
</p>
<p>when I came in unless I refer to my notes.
</p>
<p>That is, the notes you took from the newspaper. Will you swear
</p>
<p>that you saw Mr. O'Connell coming into the room that day ? I
</p>
<p>either saw him coming in or I was there before him.
</p>
<p>Is that your answer ? I am not ashamed of it.
</p>
<p>The Atlantic breezes in the county of Clare harden the face?
</p>
<p>They have not hardened mine.
</p>
<p>Do you swear that neither the Atlantic breezes nor any thing else
</p>
<p>has hardened your face ? I do not understand the question.
</p>
<p>Did you not tell me before it had not ? Not exactly.
</p>
<p>What do you answer ? I do not know that they have hardened
</p>
<p>me in any way.
</p>
<p>Then you are not hardened? No.
</p>
<p>Do you think to prove by your testimony that you are not
</p>
<p>a hardened man ? Most decidedly.
</p>
<p>Were you at the Association on the 4th of September ? I was.
</p>
<p>Were you present when Mr. O'Connell said, that no tumult
</p>
<p>should take place in his day ? I was. [The witness read the speech].
</p>
<p>I was there when Mr. O'Connell spoke that speech. I wrote this
</p>
<p>identical paper that day as the words fell from Mr. O'ConnelPs lips.
</p>
<p>I did not take that note from any Reporter's slips or from a news-
</p>
<p>paper. Mr. O'Connell said " that would not Joe an unnatural or unad.
</p>
<p>visable result." I swear it to the best of my belief. That is my own
</p>
<p>report.
</p>
<p>Was any one sitting near you at the time? I cannot remember.
</p>
<p>To the best of my recollection Mr. Edwards was there, but I am
</p>
<p>not certain of it.
</p>
<p>Can you mention any single Reporter who was there that day ?
</p>
<p>There was a host of them there.
</p>
<p>Do you swear on your oath he was there that day ? I do not.
</p>
<p>Then you cannot remember any Reporter who was there that day?
</p>
<p>The usual corps was there.
</p>
<p>Can you name any single man who saw you that day in the Asso-

</p>
<p>ciation's rooms ? Any one that was there might have seen me. I
</p>
<p>suppose Mr. O'Connell saw me. Mr. Ray must have seen me
</p>
<p>there.
</p>
<p>Did Mr. O'Connell speak to you ? I am not on speaking terms
</p>
<p>with him.
</p>
<p>Did you speak to Mr. Ray ? I cannot remember that I did.
</p>
<p>You know Mr. O'Connell and Mr. Ray are both on their trial
</p>
<p>and cannot be examined ? Yes.
</p>
<p>You were among the Reporters taking notes ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Can you recollect a single man that you saw there that day ? I
</p>
<p>connot remember at this distance of time.
</p>
<p>You cannot remember  in Italian  Non mi recordor. Who was
</p>
<p>in the chair that day ? I do not remember.
</p>
<p>Was Mr. John O'Connell there that day ? Will you allow me
</p>
<p>to refer to my notes.
</p>
<p>196
</p>
<p>Can you say whether he was or was not without referring to your
</p>
<p>notes ? I cannot.
</p>
<p>Now you may refer to your notes. Was he there ? He was. I
</p>
<p>took notes only of what these three gentlemen said, because they
</p>
<p>were the leading men. One cannot, you know, play Hamlet with
</p>
<p>the part of Hamlet left out. Mr. John O'Connell made some ob- .
</p>
<p>servations. I cannot remember how long he was speaking. About
</p>
<p>an hour. It was a long speech. I do not know who spoke before
</p>
<p>him. I do not know that any one spoke but Mr. John O'Connell,
</p>
<p>that day. He made a long speech. I did not give a verbatim note
</p>
<p>of it.
</p>
<p>" This is not an unnatural result." Were those Mr. O'Connell's
</p>
<p>words ? To the best of my belief they were.
</p>
<p>How did you get in ? The porter recognized me as belonging
</p>
<p>to the Press.
</p>
<p>I cannot remember whether I looked at any slips of other Re-
</p>
<p>porters, on that occasion. I saw Reporters writing short-hand that
</p>
<p>day. I will not swear that Mr. Edwards, the Reporter for the Free-
</p>
<p>man's Journal, was there. I think a short-hand Reporter could take
</p>
<p>a more accurate report than I could.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Whiteside.
</p>
<p>I cannot swear I saw Mr. Duffy on the 6th of July, without re-
</p>
<p>ferring to my note ; nor on the 25th of July. The room was gene-
</p>
<p>rally full. I cannot remember what Mr. Duffy said, without refer-
</p>
<p>ring to my note. I did not take down every thing he said. There
</p>
<p>was nothing remarkable about what Mr. Duffy said. I did not give
</p>
<p>an account to Government or to Mr. Kemmis of it. I did not tell
</p>
<p>them how I took my notes. All I sent to the Morning Herald is
</p>
<p>not here. I said Mr. Ray made an observation, not a speech. It
</p>
<p>was a casual observation, and occupied four lines in my notes. As
</p>
<p>well as I remember, I swear I was present, but I will not swear that
</p>
<p>my report was not copied from another paper ?
</p>
<p>Will you swear that he did not say that he got a letter stating
</p>
<p>that some ballad singers had been taken up for singing seditious songs,

</p>
<p>and that Mr. O'Connell approved of the conduct of the persors who
</p>
<p>took them up ? I will not swear that did not occur. These reports
</p>
<p>were to serve the purpose of letters; I do not undertake for their
</p>
<p>accuracy. I will not swear that Mr. O'Connell did not move a vote
</p>
<p>of thanks to the persons who arrested the ballad singers. An ad-
</p>
<p>dress of the Irish representatives was read, Mr. O'Connell com-
</p>
<p>mented on that address. It was a statement of the grievances under
</p>
<p>which the Irish people laboured, and that they were loyal to the
</p>
<p>Queen's person.
</p>
<p>You stated that Mr. O'Connell said that the Irish were not
</p>
<p>disaffected ? Yes.
</p>
<p>That they were loyal to the Queen's person ? Yes. I heard
</p>
<p>him speak of the French Constitution and Louis Phillippe, rather
</p>
<p>severely. He found fault with that Constitution, that it was a
</p>
<p>197
</p>
<p>mockery, because there was not a House of Lords in France.
</p>
<p>He said also they taught infidelity. I heard Mr. O'Connell say, he
</p>
<p>wished to correct the error that the Nation, or any other newspaper
</p>
<p>was the organ of the Association. I remember the day he proposed
</p>
<p>the plan of the Irish Parliament. I always endeavoured to tell the
</p>
<p>truth in my letters, although I made them a little flowery. The
</p>
<p>Morning Herald has changed hands lately. I heard Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>say that he would not, or the Association would not hold itself
</p>
<p>responsible for any thing that appeared in newspapers.
</p>
<p>Witness My Lord, I wish to explain.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  Sir, you have explained. I object to your
</p>
<p>making a speech.
</p>
<p>Witness I merely wish to state, before the world, that these
</p>
<p>documents and letters were put into the Crown Solicitor's hands
</p>
<p>without my knowledge. I never knew it until I saw them in the
</p>
<p>hands of the Crown Solicitor.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Moore.
</p>
<p>I took the notes of the 3rd of October, on that day at the meet-
</p>
<p>ing. I do not know the Rev. Mr. Tierney's person. I mentioned him
</p>
<p>as one of the persons who were there that day. I put his name
</p>
<p>down having asked casually what his name was. It is from hearsay I
</p>
<p>derived my knowledge of him. I mentioned, according to my notes,
</p>
<p>that he was there. To the best of my belief he was there. I never
</p>
<p>saw him before nor since. I would not take upon me to swear posi-
</p>
<p>tively he was there. Somebody, who I was told was Mr. Tierney,
</p>
<p>made a long speech.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore.  My Lords, I have been making an application to
</p>
<p>the Counsel for the Crown which they do not think they ought to
</p>
<p>comply with. Your Lordships will recollect that the witnesses have
</p>
<p>read long extracts from speeches, which it was impossible that we
</p>
<p>could have taken down correctly. My application is, that we should
</p>
<p>be furnished with copies of those extracts as read by the witnesses.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  I do not know that the Court has
</p>
<p>power to make such an order.

</p>
<p>Mr. Moore  I am sure that even if the Court has not the power
</p>
<p>of making the order, any difficulty felt on the part of the Crown, in
</p>
<p>complying with the application without the sanction of the Court,
</p>
<p>would be removed if your Lordships were to intimate that the copies
</p>
<p>ought to be furnished.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  These papers are here as documents put in on
</p>
<p>the part of the Crown ; we are, therefore, entitled to them.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General.  Such a course has never been adopted
</p>
<p>to the present time; and I object the more to it when I recollect
</p>
<p>the course adopted as to one of those witnesses. The traversers are
</p>
<p>placed in no difficulty ; they have every meeting reported by the
</p>
<p>short-hand writers for their own newspapers. Under all the circum-
</p>
<p>stances I certainly will not depart from the usual course by furnishing
</p>
<p>copies of these documents.
</p>
<p>198
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore.  I do not consider after what has been stated by
</p>
<p>the Attorney General, that I can call on the Court to make any
</p>
<p>order.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon.  I now submit that the whole evidence of the
</p>
<p>last witness Jackson should be struck out. He was brought here as
</p>
<p>a witness of what had been said and done at those meetings. From
</p>
<p>the Witness's own showing he had no means of giving evidence on the
</p>
<p>subject. This is the proper time to make the objection.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice  I do not think this is the occasion to
</p>
<p>make the objection. The Witness has been cross-examined by three
</p>
<p>of the counsel for the traversers. The objection may be well worthy
</p>
<p>of consideration, but not at this time.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin I do not think that the traversers have a
</p>
<p>right to strike out the evidence of any witness.
</p>
<p>John Brown, examined by Mr. Holmes.
</p>
<p>I reside in Nassau-street, and carry on the printing and stationery
</p>
<p>business. I have been long carrying on the business. It is at No.
</p>
<p>36. I know Mr. Ray. I have known him for several years. I have
</p>
<p>heard of an association in the city of Dublin, called the Loyal National
</p>
<p>Repeal Association of Ireland. Mr. Ray holds the situation of Secre-
</p>
<p>tary to that society. I wasemployed to dosome printing work for that
</p>
<p>society. The association generally, through Mr. Ray, employed me.
</p>
<p>I have been four or five years doing work for the society. I have
</p>
<p>been paid for the work I have done, except a running account now.
</p>
<p>I was paid by Mr. Ray, and sometimes by a clerk in his office.
</p>
<p>Have you received much money from time to time for the busi-
</p>
<p>ness you did ?
</p>
<p>I have.
</p>
<p>Could you mention how much ; be under the sum ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon.  That is not evidence against the traversers.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  It is evidence against Mr. Ray.
</p>
<p>Mr. Holmes.  What amount have you received from him from
</p>
<p>time to time? I cannot say.
</p>
<p>Have you kept any account book? I have; the account was

</p>
<p>sometimes about 20.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  I object to evidence of the contents of this gen-
</p>
<p>tleman's books being given ; they should be produced.
</p>
<p>Mr. Holmes Have you been served with a subpoena duces tecum?
</p>
<p>1 was, and I have brought the books with me.
</p>
<p>What amount have you received from Mr. Ray from time to
</p>
<p>time within the last two years?
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  I submit this is not evidence. The first act in
</p>
<p>the indictment is on the 1st of March, 1843.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  I do not see the relevancy of the
</p>
<p>inquiry.
</p>
<p>Examination resumed I printed this document for the Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation. [" Report of the Committee of the National Repeal Association
</p>
<p>of Ireland."] I printed this document also for the same Association.
</p>
<p>199
</p>
<p>[" Instructions to Repeal Wardens."] I printed these documents
</p>
<p>also. [" Description of the New Card for Members." " Proclama-
</p>
<p>tion relating to the Arbitration Courts." "Address to the Inhabi-
</p>
<p>tants of the Countries subject to the British Crown." " Rules to
</p>
<p>be observed by the Arbitrators." " Arbitration Notice." " Plan for
</p>
<p>the renewed action of the Irish Parliament."] I cannot say exactly the
</p>
<p>number of copies of the Report of the Committee that I printed,
</p>
<p>perhaps two thousand. They were sent to the Association, and I
</p>
<p>was paid for them. I printed four or five thousand copies of the
</p>
<p>" Instructions to Repeal Wardens." I was paid for them. I was
</p>
<p>paid for " Mr. O'Callaghan's Letter." I printed two hundred of the
</p>
<p>" Proclamation." two thousand of the " Arbitration Rules." I was
</p>
<p>paid for them. I printed two or three thousand of the " Address
</p>
<p>to the Inhabitants of the Countries subject to the British Crown."
</p>
<p>and was paid for them. I printed some of those documents from
</p>
<p>manuscript, and some of them from extracts from the Newspapers.
</p>
<p>I have none of those manuscripts. I was served with a subpoena to
</p>
<p>produce them, and I searched for them. I took this document
</p>
<p>I produce, of " Leinster for Repeal," from the printing office file.
</p>
<p>I cannot say whether any thing was printed from it.
</p>
<p>Examination resumed.  I have a book in which payments are
</p>
<p>entered.
</p>
<p>Mr. Holmes.  -Look in the book whether there is any entry made
</p>
<p>of payment for that document ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside.  The entries in that book cannot be evidence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin Have you any entry relating to that do-
</p>
<p>cument ?
</p>
<p>Examination continued  There are two entries relating to a
</p>
<p>document for the Mullaghmast meeting. I printed 2000 of that docu-
</p>
<p>ment, which is entered ; it is headed " Leinster for Repeal." I printed
</p>
<p>it for this Association, and was paid for it. The newspaper called Mul-
</p>
<p>laghmast a monster meeting. I have no documents which I printed for
</p>
<p>the intended meeting at Clontarf. I think I printed some for the Don-
</p>
<p>nybrook meeting. I did not bring all the documents, for it would

</p>
<p>take a cart to bring them. I brought these in compliance with the
</p>
<p>subpoena. All that are here were printed for the Association, and
</p>
<p>I was paid for them. I printed this document for Mr. Mahony.
</p>
<p>[" An Address as to the Revision of the Jury List, to the People of
</p>
<p>Ireland."]
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside.  There is no proof that any of these documents
</p>
<p>have been used by the traversers. They are no evidence against
</p>
<p>Mr. Duffy. The only evidence of his being a member of the Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation is, that he was seen once handing in money at Calvert's
</p>
<p>Theatre.
</p>
<p>Mr. Holmes  Every one of the traversers is a member of the As-
</p>
<p>sociation, and these were printed for the Association, and paid for by
</p>
<p>the Association.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon.  The only evidence before the Court is that
</p>
<p>Browne printed these documents for the Association ; but, with one
</p>
<p>200
</p>
<p>exception, it does not appear when. It does not follow, from the
</p>
<p>date of the document of the 3rd of October, that it was printed then.
</p>
<p>All the overt acts charged in the indictment arose since March, 1843.
</p>
<p>Acts done by the Association four years ago, ought not to be now
</p>
<p>read in evidence of a conspiracy sought to be proved by acts done
</p>
<p>since March, 1843.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice  The Court is of opinion that the
</p>
<p>documents may be read against all the traversers.
</p>
<p>The Deputy Clerk of the Crown then proceeded to read the " In-
</p>
<p>structions to Repeal Wardens"
</p>
<p>Mr. Macdonagh My Lords, I object to these documents being
</p>
<p>read in evidence against my client. There is no evidence of their
</p>
<p>having been adopted or introduced at any of the meetings of the
</p>
<p>Association, and they are offered in evidence on this principle, that
</p>
<p>they were ordered to be printed by the Secretary of the Association
</p>
<p>at some time or other. I now beg leave to call your Lordships' at-
</p>
<p>tention to the bill of particulars furnished by the Crown, and then to
</p>
<p>my present objection, and then to some authorities in support of it.
</p>
<p>The indictment after the general language used in cases of conspiracy,
</p>
<p>particularizes the overt acts. The bill of particulars furnished by the
</p>
<p>Crown, is as follows: " In addition to the several matters and things
</p>
<p>" set out in the first count of the indictment, it is intended to give
</p>
<p>" in evidence in support of the prosecution, the speeches made,
</p>
<p>" the resolutions moved or adopted, the acts done, the letters and
</p>
<p>" other documents read, and the several proceedings which occurred,
</p>
<p>" or took place, at each and every of the several meetings in the said
</p>
<p>" first count specified or referred to ; and also the speeches made,
</p>
<p>" the resolution, proposed or adopted, the acts done, the letters and
</p>
<p>" other documents read, and the several proceedings which occurred
</p>
<p>" or took place at each of the several occasions following, that is to
</p>
<p>" say, at meetings of persons styling themselves the Loyal National
</p>
<p>" Repeal Association, &c." The bill of particulars then specifies the
</p>
<p>several meetings of the Repeal Association, and the several monster
</p>
<p>meetings in the country : " And it is further intended to give in

</p>
<p>" newspapers following.'' A number of newspapers are then set
</p>
<p>out bv name and date. The overt acts in the indictment are the
</p>
<p>various meetings held either in the open air, or at the Association,
</p>
<p>and the insertion in several newspapers of various publications. It
</p>
<p>is perfectly plain that these documents do not fall within any of
</p>
<p>these overt acts. They were not proposed or adopted at any of
</p>
<p>these meetings, nor were they published in any of these newspapers,
</p>
<p>nor do they fall within the comprehensive and extensive words of the
</p>
<p>bill of particulars. The Crown have taken a wide range, they ap-
</p>
<p>prised us by the bill of particulars, that every act done or speech made,
</p>
<p>201
</p>
<p>or resolution and letters or other documents proposed at any one of
</p>
<p>these meetings of the Loyal National Repeal Association shall be given
</p>
<p>in evidence. When they have taken so large and comprehensive a range,
</p>
<p>it is plain that in common justice they should be confined within it.
</p>
<p>They have also stated, that they would give in evidence, the speeches
</p>
<p>and resolutions passed at Limerick, Sligo, Ennis, Athlone, and other
</p>
<p>meetings. I contend that the documents here, fall within the range
</p>
<p>of neither of these two distinct classes of evidence. Ample latitude
</p>
<p>has been allowed to the Crown on this occasion ; and I submit, that
</p>
<p>in a case of conspiracy like this, the Crown are not at liberty to wan-
</p>
<p>der out of the bill of particulars which they have furnished, and the
</p>
<p>overt acts, specified in the indictment. It would be manifestly un-
</p>
<p>just that they should. In Rex v. Hamilton, 7 Car. & P. 454, an ap-
</p>
<p>plication was made for a bill of particulars. It was the case of a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy to obtain goods under false pretences ; a bill of particulars was
</p>
<p>furnished, which was not sufficiently full, and an application was
</p>
<p>made for a further bill of particulars, which was granted. That case
</p>
<p>proves that the Crown are strictly confined to the evidence which
</p>
<p>is stated in the bill of particulars. This case should be decided on
</p>
<p>the general principle of law, and not in reference to the magnitude
</p>
<p>or character of this case. The bill of particulars was furnished on the
</p>
<p>13th of November, 1843, when the Crown were fully apprised of their
</p>
<p>case. On these grounds, my Lords, I submit, on the part of Mr.
</p>
<p>Barrett, that these documents are not admissible against him.
</p>
<p>The Attorney- General My Lords, there is one observation of
</p>
<p>Mr. Macdonagti s, in which I concur ; that is, that no distinction
</p>
<p>is to be made between this and any other case which may be tried in
</p>
<p>this Court. I shall show that these documents are, on clearly legal
</p>
<p>principles, admissible. I entirely deny Mr. 3Iacdonagh's legal pro-
</p>
<p>position, that a party is bound to furnish, in his bill of particulars, the
</p>
<p>evidence on which he intends to rely. There is no such rule of law.
</p>
<p>The rule of law is, that you are, in a case of conspiracy in which
</p>
<p>overt acts are not stated, to furnish the parties accused with the par-
</p>
<p>ticulars of the charges against them. But it is neither law, reason,

</p>
<p>nor common sense, that you are to furnish them with the evidence in
</p>
<p>support of those charges. That has been decided in cases of treason,
</p>
<p>where more particularity is required than in cases of conspiracy. In
</p>
<p>Phillips on Evidence, 492, the rule is thus laid down : "the meaning
</p>
<p>" of the rule is, not that the whole detail of facts should be set forth,
</p>
<p>" but that no overt act, amounting to a distinct, independent charge,
</p>
<p>" though falling under the same head of treason, shall be given in
</p>
<p>" evidence, unless it be expressly laid in the indictment ; but still, if
</p>
<p>" it conduce to the proof of any of the overt acts which are laid, it
</p>
<p>" may be admitted as evidence of such overt acts. With this
</p>
<p>" view, the declarations of the prisoner, and seditious language
</p>
<p>" used by him, are clearly admissible in evidence, as explaining
</p>
<p>" his conduct, and showing the nature and object of the conspiracy."
</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to insert overt acts in the indictment for conspiracy.
</p>
<p>In consequence of the difficulty which the traversers might be put
</p>
<p>to, arising from the adoption of this course, it has become the cus-
</p>
<p>2d
</p>
<p>202
</p>
<p>torn to furnish a bill of particulars of the charges ; and there is a rule
</p>
<p>in the Queen's Bench in England to that effect. But it is never ne-
</p>
<p>cessary to furnish particulars of the evidence which is to be adduced
</p>
<p>in support of those charges. It was so decided in Rex v. Watson,
</p>
<p>32 St. Tr., which was a case of high treason, and therefore, a fortio-
</p>
<p>ri to the present case. The nature of the present indictment and bill
</p>
<p>of particulars shows that these documents are admissible. The overt
</p>
<p>acts in the indictment are, the monster meetings, the meetings at the
</p>
<p>Association, the speeches and other matters at the Association,
</p>
<p>and also publications in the newspapers. These documents are evi-
</p>
<p>evidence in support of those overt acts. The principle of all the
</p>
<p>cases I submit to your Lordships is, that the bill of particulars is to
</p>
<p>put the parties in possession of the general nature of the charges. All
</p>
<p>the matters stated in the bill of particulars are with that view, and
</p>
<p>are stated as overt acts, and not as evidence. That is the princi-
</p>
<p>ple of the case in Roper's case, 6 St. Tr., 687, which establishes
</p>
<p>that would be most inconvenient to set out the nature of the evi-
</p>
<p>dence. We have put them in possession of what we should have
</p>
<p>done, and are not bound to do more. The publications stated in the
</p>
<p>indictment are not evidence but overt acts in themselves. We have
</p>
<p>given them general information to prevent surprise. This evidence
</p>
<p>showing the nature and constitution of the Association not an overt
</p>
<p>act I submit is receivable.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore.  I am, my Lords, on the same side with Mr. Mac-
</p>
<p>donagh to support the objection to the reception of these docu-
</p>
<p>ments in evidence. It is material, in the first instance, to ascertain
</p>
<p>the nature of the evidence offered. The only evidence, with res-
</p>
<p>pect to these documents, is, that they were printed by order of,
</p>
<p>and paid for by, the Secretary of the Repeal Association. There is
</p>
<p>no evidence of the time when, or of the circumstances under which they
</p>
<p>were printed. It is most material to ascertain the time when these
</p>
<p>documents were printed, because any of the traversers might unfairly
</p>
<p>be visited with acts for which they were not responsible. I acknow-
</p>
<p>ledge that the question for the Court now to decide is, whether these

</p>
<p>documents are admissible, not being contained in the indictment and
</p>
<p>the bill of particulars. The bill of particulars purports, in addition to
</p>
<p>several matters which are set out in the first count of the indictment,
</p>
<p>to give in evidence several other matters which are specified. In
</p>
<p>the first count of the indictment there is a great variety of overt acts,
</p>
<p>consisting of meetings, speeches, and publications, set out in detail,
</p>
<p>specifically as overt acts. Accordingly, the bill of particulars states
</p>
<p>that it is intended to give all these matters in evidence which are there
</p>
<p>set out. It is not pretended, nor can it be pretended, that any men-
</p>
<p>tion is made, in any of the overt acts, of these publications and do-
</p>
<p>cuments. Then comes the question, are they included in the mat-
</p>
<p>ter specified ? I submit they are not. There are three classes of
</p>
<p>things set out in the bill of particulars, in support of which it is pro-
</p>
<p>posed to give evidence. First, the several meetings there specified.
</p>
<p>There is no evidence to connect these documents with them. The
</p>
<p>next general head is, the several meetings at the Association, which
</p>
<p>203
</p>
<p>are specified in tlie bill of* particulars by dale. Have your Lordships
</p>
<p>any evidence that any one of these documents were ever read, or con-
</p>
<p>sidered, or known, at any one of these several meetings? If there is
</p>
<p>any use in a bill of particulars it is to apprise the parties accused of
</p>
<p>the evidence which is to be adduced against them. I apprehend that
</p>
<p>these documents do not come within either of the general heads which
</p>
<p>I have referred to. Well, my Lords, what is the third head specified
</p>
<p>in the indictment ? It is the several newspapers. All those are set
</p>
<p>out in detail in the bill of particulars, and there is nothing to connect
</p>
<p>these documents with them. I therefore submit, my Lords, that the
</p>
<p>Crown are not entitled to give in evidence these documents, as not
</p>
<p>coming either within the indictment or the bill of particulars.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor- General.  My Lords, theobjection now taken to these
</p>
<p>documents is, that they are not specified in the indictment or the bill
</p>
<p>of particulars as overt acts, or as pieces of evidence. It is contended
</p>
<p>by the counsel for the traversers, that it is the duty of the Crown to
</p>
<p>apprise the traversers by the bill of particulars of the line of evidence
</p>
<p>which it is intended to adopt. That is a misconception of the rule
</p>
<p>of law. The rule of law is not that you are to set out the evidence,
</p>
<p>but to apprise the party of the nature of the charge against him,
</p>
<p>and the Crown are not to bring forward evidence in support of any
</p>
<p>particular charge without apprising the party of that charge. Ac-
</p>
<p>cordingly the objection in the case in 7 Car. & P. was this : there
</p>
<p>was no overt act put forward in the indictment, and it was objected
</p>
<p>that the particulars delivered were too general, and did not limit
</p>
<p>the charge in any way either to place, persons, or facts, nor did it
</p>
<p>state what specific acts the party was charged with. But these docu-
</p>
<p>ments are not overt acts, nor are they charges in themselves, but
</p>
<p>they are pieces of evidence. That is the first answer to the argu-
</p>
<p>ment on the other side. The second answer is this, your Lordships
</p>
<p>have it in evidence that at one of the meetings specified in the bill
</p>
<p>of particulars, the appointment of Repeal Wardens took place; that
</p>
<p>was one of the proceedings at the meeting. This document is the
</p>
<p>instructions as to the duty of the Repeal Wardens. There is also a

</p>
<p>third answer. One of the charges in the indictment is the collection
</p>
<p>of divers sums of money in various parts of Ireland, and the docu-
</p>
<p>ment in question shews that the collection of money is one of the
</p>
<p>duties of the Repeal Wardens.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  For a time I was somewhat taken
</p>
<p>by the arguments in support of this objection ; but I did not at first
</p>
<p>understand the nature of the indictmeut. I see that a particular overt
</p>
<p>act of conspiracy specified in it is the levying and collecting sums of
</p>
<p>money throughout the country, for the purposes of this Association.
</p>
<p>Now, surely, no specification that the parties who collected the mo-
</p>
<p>ney were Repeal Wardens is required in the bill of particulars. There
</p>
<p>is no surprise in this. The traversers have had abundant notice of
</p>
<p>the charge against them.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Burton.  I certainly was under a misapprehension
</p>
<p>as to the nature of the objection. A party is entitled to a notifica-
</p>
<p>tion ; and if that notification is made in a manner calculated to cloak
</p>
<p>204
</p>
<p>the real matters intended to be relied on from the knowledge of the
</p>
<p>parties, it is certainly the duty of the Court to see that the parties
</p>
<p>are not taken by surprise ; but I do not conceive that to be the objec-
</p>
<p>tion in this case. There has been a great deal of documentary evi-
</p>
<p>dence ; and it more than once struck me that it would be a matter
</p>
<p>of reasonable accommodation if the Crown should furnish to the tra-
</p>
<p>versers' counsel copies of that documentary evidence, in order that
</p>
<p>they might be better prepared to meet that by other evidence in an-
</p>
<p>swer to it, or, at all events, that they might not be taken by surprise.
</p>
<p>But, in truth, there is no ground for saying that the traversers have
</p>
<p>been taken by surprise. A full bill of particulars has been furnished
</p>
<p>to the traversers, and this evidence comes within that bill of particu-
</p>
<p>lars. There can have been, therefore, no misapprehension on the
</p>
<p>part of the traversers ; they have had full notice. I therefore think
</p>
<p>the evidence is admissible.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  I entirely concur with my Lord
</p>
<p>Chief Justice. I think this evidence is clearly admissible, and ad-
</p>
<p>missible on the distinction taken in the first instance by the Attorney
</p>
<p>General. The fallacy on the part of the traversers'" counsel arises
</p>
<p>altogether from confounding the charge, or overt act in the indict-
</p>
<p>ment, with the evidence to be given in support of it. I do not
</p>
<p>think the Crown is called upon to show that every specific matter
</p>
<p>which is offered in evidence is to be found in the bill of particulars.
</p>
<p>According to my notion, the bill of particulars is to inform the party
</p>
<p>charged with the nature of the particulars of the charge, but not of any
</p>
<p>portion of the evidence. That I take to be the principle. Mr. Mac-
</p>
<p>donagh cited an important case, which no doubt in some degree
</p>
<p>bears on his argument. But I have looked to the case, or rather
</p>
<p>the order made in that case, and it is not at all applicable to such a
</p>
<p>case as this. The order was: "that the prosecutor deliver to the de-
</p>
<p>" fendant, Mr.Woolf, or his attorney, a particular statement and specific
</p>
<p>" charge, in writing, to be made against the said Mr. Woolf under this
</p>
<p>" indictment, in order that he may be enabled fairly to defend himself
</p>
<p>" against such charge." Thus it did not refer to a particle of the evi-

</p>
<p>dence, but merely the particulars of the charge. That was the case of
</p>
<p>an indictment for a conspiracy to obtain goods under false pretences,
</p>
<p>and the prosecutor would have been at liberty to give in evidence,
</p>
<p>false pretences different from those set out in the indictment, if a
</p>
<p>bill of particulars had not been delivered. If the counts in the
</p>
<p>indictment had been specific, if they had stated all the charges which
</p>
<p>were to be brought against the defendant, the prosecutor would not
</p>
<p>have been obliged to give a bill of particulars. Mr. Justice Littledale
</p>
<p>says : " The effect ofa bill of particulars is, where a count is framed in
</p>
<p>" a general form to give the opposite party the same information
</p>
<p>" that he would give if there was a special count." Well, the pre-
</p>
<p>sent indictment contains counts specifically setting out the particulars
</p>
<p>of this charge and the overt acts. Other counts are general, and
</p>
<p>do not set them out. If the general counts had been omitted, the
</p>
<p>party would have been entitled to no bill of particulars. He has got
</p>
<p>a bill of particulars to meet the case of the open count. The order
</p>
<p>205
</p>
<p>in this case is, that the charge and not the evidence of the charge,
</p>
<p>is to be set out in the bill of particulars. It is a general count,
</p>
<p>and suppose a particular document intended to be brought forward
</p>
<p>in support of it, for instance, this document, as evidence that the
</p>
<p>.Repeal Wardens had been appointed on a particular day at the
</p>
<p>Association, and of instruction having being given to them. The
</p>
<p>question is, are the documents emanating from the Association,
</p>
<p>evidences under the general count against this Association, namely,
</p>
<p>the appointment of Repeal Wardens. These documents do not support
</p>
<p>my new charge against the traversers, which is not stated in the in-
</p>
<p>dictment, or in the bill of particulars. If they were brought for-
</p>
<p>ward in support of a charge different from those in the indictment,
</p>
<p>then I think, the objection ought to prevail ; but the question is,
</p>
<p>whether they make a new charge, or whether they are not evidence
</p>
<p>in support of the charges in the indictment. It appears to me that
</p>
<p>they are quite germain to the charges. It is quite important and
</p>
<p>material to know the nature and the constitution of this body, which
</p>
<p>the traversers are charged by the indictment with forming. It is
</p>
<p>quite material to know the duties of these Repeal Wardens. T his
</p>
<p>evidence is not brought forward in order to make a distinct charge
</p>
<p>against the traversers, but to sustain a charge on the face of the in-
</p>
<p>dictment. This document is signed by Daniel O'Connell, one of the
</p>
<p>traversers, as Chairman of a Committee, appointed by the Association.
</p>
<p>Suppose there had been no printed instructions at all, but that this gen-
</p>
<p>tleman had given parol instructions to a certain number of those Re-
</p>
<p>peal Wardens, as to the duties they were to perform. Can any person
</p>
<p>say that these instructions are not evidence against the person who gave
</p>
<p>them ? I say manifestly and clearly, they are, under every count of the
</p>
<p>indictment. Then if those instructions, if given by parol, would have
</p>
<p>been evidence, would they not be evidence when in print? would they
</p>
<p>not be evidence if they were in Mr. O'Connell's hand-writing ?
</p>
<p>Clearly they would. Then what is the effect of their being printed?
</p>
<p>Are they not as much his act as if they were in his hand-writing?
</p>
<p>Then if they are admissible against one, they are admissible against all,

</p>
<p>because they are the act ot the whole body. The bill of particulars
</p>
<p>may limit the party who serves it, to the charges in it, but it does
</p>
<p>not limit him to the documents stated in it. I do not see how it is
</p>
<p>possible to say that it does. In my opinion, therefore, this evidence
</p>
<p>is admissible.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin  The difficulty in this case appears to have
</p>
<p>arisen from the manner in which the bill of particulars is framed.
</p>
<p>There can be no question that if there had been no bill of particulars
</p>
<p>this would clearly have been evidence in support of the general count
</p>
<p>in the indictment. The authority cited by the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>appears to me to be so far applicable. The object of a bill of parti-
</p>
<p>culars is to narrow the field of evidence, and to confine the parties
</p>
<p>to the evidence there stated. This bill of particulars is not in the
</p>
<p>ordinary form. We are under the disadvantage of having no rule in
</p>
<p>this Court to ascertain what the party is to be confined to, nor have
</p>
<p>we, on the other hand, any notice calling for this bill of particulars
</p>
<p>206
</p>
<p>before. But the Crown appears to confine not only the charge but
</p>
<p>the evidence, because the bill of particulars is in this form : "that in
</p>
<p>" addition to the overt acts in the first count the Crown will give in
</p>
<p>*' evidence the several matters, &c. which took place at each of the
</p>
<p>u several occasions, that is, at meetings," &c. I should certainly un-
</p>
<p>derstand that to mean that the evidence was to be confined to acts
</p>
<p>done at those meetings. It is a new mode of framing a bill of parti-
</p>
<p>culars, because it is not confined to charges or to the evidence growing
</p>
<p>out of the charges at one single meeting. But then it is said that
</p>
<p>there is an overt act relating to the first count, under which this evi-
</p>
<p>dence is admissible, that therefore it is admissible generally. This
</p>
<p>seems to be the opinion of the Court. It is to be observed that this
</p>
<p>is a printed document, proved to have been printed at the instance of
</p>
<p>one of the traversers, who was proved to have been the Secretary of
</p>
<p>the Association, and to have paid for the printing of it out of the
</p>
<p>funds of the Association. It is also the act of the Committee, and
</p>
<p>therefore applying it to the overt act to which I have referred, as
</p>
<p>the rest of the Court are of opinion that it is evidence, the docu-
</p>
<p>ment ought to be received.
</p>
<p>Mr. Macdonagh.  My Lords, I am not about to re-discuss the
</p>
<p>question that has just been decided, but I merely wish to say, that
</p>
<p>it is doubtful whether a bill of exceptions will lie in a case of misde-
</p>
<p>meanor. I believe there are authorities to show that it does.
</p>
<p>It is the intention of the traversers to take a bill of exceptions.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Ckampton.  It would require a strong argument
</p>
<p>to convince me that a bill of exceptions may be taken in a trial at
</p>
<p>bar, for a misdemeanor.
</p>
<p>The Deputy Clerk of the Crown then read the following docu-
</p>
<p>ments :

</p>

<p>" this plain but all-important question,  Shall Ireland continue to be
</p>
<p>" an ill-used province ? or shall Ireland be again a nation ; pos-
</p>
<p>" sessing a Parliament, freely chosen by her own people, and making
</p>
<p>" laws for the protection and benefit of the eight millions of her
</p>
<p>' brave, moral, and industrious inhabitants ?
</p>
<p>" Speak, then, Repeal Wardens and Collectors! Will you, through
</p>
<p>" apathy, suffer your country to continue what she is  a neglected
</p>
<p>" and pauperised province ? when it is in your power, by constitu-
</p>
<p>" tional exertion alone, to elevate her to the position and dignity of
</p>
<p>* a happy, contented, and prosperous nation ! !
</p>
<p>" In order effectually to repeal the baneful Act of Union, there is
</p>
<p>" only one thing necessary to be done, and that one thing is  to
</p>
<p>" perfect the legal and peaceable organization of the great majority
</p>
<p>" of the Irish people, and to have their names enrolled in the books
</p>
<p>" of the Loyal National Repeal Association. Such was the simple
</p>
<p>" but successful plan whereby Catholic Emancipation was extorted
</p>
<p>" from the grasp of a reluctant British ministry.
</p>
<p>" We have told you, that there is only one thing necessary to be
</p>
<p>" done, in order to enable Irishmen to regain their legislative inde-
</p>
<p>" pendence ; and that one simple thing is, to have Ireland legally and
</p>
<p>" peaceably organized !
</p>
<p>" We shall now proceed to point out the mode by which this
</p>
<p>" constitutional organization is to be completed ; and for that pur-
</p>
<p>" pose we shall consider, in the first place, what are the necessary
</p>
<p>" qualifications of Repeal Wardens and Collectors.
</p>
<p>" First  and above all things.  The Repeal Wardens and Collec-
</p>
<p>" should be men of good moral character.
</p>
<p>" Secondly They should enjoy the respect of their clergy, let
</p>
<p>" them belong to what religious denomination they may.
</p>
<p>" Thirdly  They should possess an intimate knowledge of the

</p>
<p>" district to be collected by them.
</p>
<p>" Fourthly.  They should be men determined to exert them-
</p>
<p>" selves strenuously in enrolling Members and Associates.
</p>
<p>" Fifthly They should be persons disposed to reason calmly with
</p>
<p>M such as refuse their co-operation in the Repeal cause at present ;
</p>
<p>" but to avoid all strife, and never to reproach those who differ from
</p>
<p>" them in opinion.
</p>
<p>" Sixthly They should be persons who understand the principal
</p>
<p>"arguments in favour of Repeal ; who are able to explain to those
</p>
<p>" who may want information on the subject, the strict legal means by
</p>
<p>" which Repeal is to be gained ; the advantages that should result
</p>
<p>" to Ireland from the re-establishment of her native Parliament ;
</p>
<p>u what has been the rapid decline of Irish trade and manufacture,
</p>
<p>" and what the increase of Irish poverty and destitution, since the
</p>
<p>u baneful Act of Union was forced upon the country against the ex-
</p>
<p>208
</p>
<p>" pressed will, and in opposition to the decided interests of its in-
</p>
<p>" habitants.
</p>
<p>" We shall next describe the mode in which Wardens and Col-
</p>
<p>" lectors are to be appointed.
</p>
<p>" The first mode we recommend, and indeed the wisest and best,
</p>
<p>" is to have proper and efficient persons recommended to the as-
</p>
<p>ii sociation by. the parochial clergy, for the various streets, townlands,
</p>
<p>" or other districts, into which their parishes are to be divided.
</p>
<p>" Secondly.  Should the clergy not interfere, the persons to act
</p>
<p>" as Wardens should then be recommended at a public meeting; but
</p>
<p> in either case, their names must be transmitted to the Repeal As-
</p>
<p>" sociation in Dublin, and their appointment regularly moved ; for the
</p>
<p>" National Repeal Association alone is competent legally to appoint
</p>
<p>" the Wardens. Other persons, bodies, or meetings may recommend,
</p>
<p>" but they cannot appoint ; the power of appointment to these offices
</p>
<p>" rests with the Association alone legally; but every reliance may be
</p>
<p>" had that, unless for some very strong reasons, the recommendation
</p>
<p>" of the persons named will be confirmed by the Association. When
</p>
<p>" each Repeal Warden is thus duly appointed, he will receive a writ-
</p>
<p>" ten notification from the Association, and when he shall have com-
</p>
<p>" pleted remittances to the amount of 5, he will be presented with
</p>
<p>" the handsome diploma recently designed.
</p>
<p>" Duties of the Repeal Wardens The first duty of the Repeal
</p>
<p>" Wardens is to divide the parish or place into districts of convenient
</p>
<p>" size, and each to take upon himself the care of one district.
</p>
<p>" The second duty of each Repeal Warden is, to appoint as many
</p>
<p>" collectors as he may deem necessary to act with him, and to collect
</p>
<p>" the Repeal Fund regularly within his district from each individual
</p>
<p>" willing to contribute a farthing a week, a penny a month, or a shil-
</p>
<p>" ling a year  taking care to make every person favourable to the
</p>
<p>" Repeal understand that, unless he contributes to the amount of a
</p>
<p>" shilling a year his name cannot be enrolled as a Repealer, and
</p>
<p>" therefore he will be calculated upon by the enemies of Ireland as
</p>
<p>" against the Repeal !

</p>
<p>" The third duty of each active Repeal Warden is to supply the
</p>
<p>" place, so far as he possibly can, of any Repeal Warden who shall,
</p>
<p>" through illness or other cause, neglect having his district collected,
</p>
<p>" and to complete the collection in such neglected district, as though
</p>
<p>" it were his own, reporting such neglect to the Association.
</p>
<p>" The fourth duty of the Repeal Wardens of each parish or dis-
</p>
<p>" trict, will be, to select the most efficient amongst them as an In-
</p>
<p>spector. In every case where one or all of the parochial clergy
</p>
<p>" can be prevailed on to act in that capacity, they should be selected
</p>
<p>" without hesitation. But should the parochial clergy be disinclined
</p>
<p>" to act, the Wardens ought then name some zealous and intelligent
</p>
<p>" person of their own body to act as such Inspector ; always taking
</p>
<p>" ca<e to transmit the names of such individuals, in the first instance,
</p>
<p>" to the Association for appointment.
</p>
<p>" The fifth duty of the Repeal Wardens is to transmit to the
</p>
<p>" Secretary of the Repeal Association in Dublin, if possible weekly,
</p>
<p>209
</p>
<p>" and if not weekly, at as short periods as possible, the amount col-
</p>
<p>" lected, and the names and residences of the contributors, that thev
</p>
<p>" may be enrolled as Associates, or admitted Members, as the case
</p>
<p>" may be, and the cards duly forwarded accordingly. The Wardens
</p>
<p>" are to be careful in keeping copies of these lists, to facilitate the
</p>
<p>" collections.
</p>
<p>" The sixth duty of the Repeal Wardens is to procure signatures
</p>
<p>" to the various petitions agreed to by the Association, or by any
</p>
<p>" Repeal Meeting, and to take special care that none but genuine
</p>
<p>" signatures are affixed thereto ; or when persons cannot write, to
</p>
<p>" obtain their authority for affixing their names ; and also to trans-
</p>
<p>" mit such petitions, either to the Secretary of the Repeal Associa-
</p>
<p>* tion in Dublin, or to the Member of Parliament fixed upon to pre-
</p>
<p>" sent them.
</p>
<p>" The seventh duty of the Repeal Wardens is, to promote the Re-
</p>
<p>" gistry of Parliamentary, Municipal, and Poor Law Electors, on the
</p>
<p>" liberal interest, by ascertaining the names and qualifications of all
</p>
<p>" such persons, not registered, who are qualified, and inducing them
</p>
<p>" to take the necessary steps to have their franchise established.
</p>
<p>" The eighth duty of the Repeal Wardens is, to promote the en-
</p>
<p>" couragement of Irish Manufactures in their several districts, to the
</p>
<p>" exclusion of all foreign-made articles.
</p>
<p>" The ninth duty of the Repeal Wardens is, to take care that
</p>
<p>" there shall be transmitted from the Association to each locality, a
</p>
<p>" weekly newspaper for every two hundred Associates, or a three-
</p>
<p>" day paper for every four hundred, enrolled in such locality, as the
</p>
<p>" case may be. The sum of ten pounds collected and forwarded to
</p>
<p>" the Association, entitles the Repealers of the district whence it
</p>
<p>" comes to a weekly paper for the entire year gratis ; and the sum
</p>
<p>" of twenty pounds entitles them to the Pilot or Evening Freeman
</p>
<p>11 newspaper, for the same period, if they prefer either to the weekly
</p>
<p>" paper.
</p>
<p>" The tenth duty of the Repeal Wardens is, to have the news-
</p>
<p>" papers to which each parish or district may be entitled put into the

<p>" hands of such persons as will give the greatest circulation to their
</p>
<p>" contents ; so that each paper may be read by, and its contents com-
</p>
<p>" municated to, as many people as possible.
</p>
<p>" For the purpose of circulating the proceedings of the Associa-
</p>
<p>" tion and other Repeal news, by access to the newspapers, and also
</p>
<p>" for the purpose of transacting general business, such as arrantdno'
</p>
<p>" accounts, paying in subscriptions, transmitting the receipts to Dub-
</p>
<p>" lin, &c, we would recommend that wherever there is a sufficient
</p>
<p>u number of Repealers enrolled the Wardens and Collectors should
</p>
<p>" provide a convenient room to meet in. Such a room can be
</p>
<p>" hired for a mere trifle weekly in any town or village ; but the War-
</p>
<p>" dens are in every such case to consult the Association in Dublin
</p>
<p>" previously.
</p>
<p>" The office of Repeal Warden, though highly honourable and
</p>
<p>" eminently useful, must be purely ministerial. They must not be,
</p>
<p>" or be considered as representatives or delegates. It is plain that,
</p>
<p>2E
</p>
<p>210
</p>
<p>" in point of fact, they are not so. But they must not assume or
</p>
<p>" pretend to be so, nor must any of them violate the law in any re-
</p>
<p>" spect. We are quite satisfied that nobody will be recommended
</p>
<p>" for the appointment but one who is thoroughly convinced that who-
</p>
<p>" ever violates the law strengthens the enemies of Ireland ; this is an
</p>
<p>" axiom of the most undoubted truth. It ought, we repeat it, to be.
</p>
<p>"engraved on the mind of every Repealer, that 'whoever violates
</p>
<p>" the law strengthens the enemies of Ireland.'
</p>
<p>" The Repeal Wardens are not to be, nor to consider themselves
</p>
<p>" to be, nor to act as, a separate and distinct body from the Repeal As-
</p>
<p>" sociation, but are, in fact, local committees of that body, and sub-
</p>
<p>ject to its control. Neither are there to be established separate
</p>
<p>" associations or branches, distinct from the Association in Dublin ;
</p>
<p>" but all are to belong to, and form part of the one Association in
</p>
<p>" Dublin. The Loyal National Repeal Association could not act in
</p>
<p>" connexion with such separate bodies, which thus, instead of being
</p>
<p>" an assistance to the cause of Repeal, would become a source of
</p>
<p>" weakness by division.
</p>
<p>" The eleventhi'and last duty we shall point out to the Repeal
</p>
<p>" Wardens, is one of the greatest possible importance. It is to use
</p>
<p>" all their influence and timely exertion to have all meetings perfectly
</p>
<p>" peaceable, and on all occasions to prevent riot or disorder of any
</p>
<p>" kind. Above all things, they should endeavour to detect and
</p>
<p>" bring to justice any wretch wicked enough to venture to administer
</p>
<p>" a secret oath. He who would administer a secret oath would like-
</p>
<p>" wise sell his unfortunate victim the moment after he succeeded in
</p>
<p>" duping him to take it. The Repeal Wardens must also prevent
</p>
<p>" the formation or continuance of any secret society whatsoever.
</p>
<p>" Remember that ' he who commits a crime gives strength to the
</p>
<p>" enemy.'
</p>
<p>" In conclusion, we call firmly upon the Repeal Wardens to do
</p>
<p>" their duty  to perform the glorious task allotted to them. The
</p>
<p>" success of the Repeal agitation depends principally, if not entirely,
</p>
<p>" upon their exertions. If we can get Repeal Wardens in every pa-

<p> rish to act energetically, and, above all, perseveringly, the Repeal
</p>
<p>" of the Union is certain.
</p>
<p>" Let every Repeal Warden recollect that upon his own indivi-
</p>
<p>" dual exertion may depend the greatest possible quantity of good to
</p>
<p>" his native country.
</p>

</p>
<p>211
</p>
<p>Mr. Maedonagh.  I object to this being received in evidence
</p>
<p>against Mr. Barrett. This is solely the act of Mr. Ray. There is
</p>
<p>no overt act in the indictment to which it can be referred. The
</p>
<p>general ground on which the Court decided in favour of the recep-
</p>
<p>tion of the former document was, that there is an overt act in the
</p>
<p>indictment to which it was referrible. That does not apply to the
</p>
<p>present objection. A learned Judge has said: " that the doctrine of
</p>
<p>" making all persons charged with conspiracy, liable for the acts of
</p>
<p>" one had gone far enough, and should be carried no farther." In
</p>
<p>order to let in such evidence, it must be clear and demonstrated to
</p>
<p>the mind of the Judge who has to decide on the admissibility of the
</p>
<p>evidence, that the act was done in furtherance of the common ob-
</p>
<p>ject and intent of the conspiracy. Every statement or every act
</p>
<p>cannot be admitted. It must be said or done in furtherance of the
</p>
<p>common purpose, otherwise the act or statement of the one is not
</p>
<p>the act or statement of the other. It has been decided, that a letter
</p>
<p>written by one, unless it is for the purpose of forwarding the com-
</p>
<p>mon object, is not evidence against the other. I have a further ob-
</p>
<p>jection to this document. It purports to be a letter explaining some
</p>
<p>document which is not yet in evidence. It was referred to in the
</p>
<p>Attorney General's statement, but it is not yet in evidence. Be-
</p>
<p>cause it is printed by Mr. Browne, and paid for by Mr. Ray, it is
</p>
<p>contended that it is evidence against my client. The document was
</p>
<p>ordered to be printed by Mr. O'Callaghan, and paid for by Mr. Ray.
</p>
<p>If it had been ordered by the Association, through Mr. Ray, it might
</p>
<p>have been evidence. But under these circumstances, and on both
</p>
<p>these grounds, I submit, my Lords, that this document ought not to
</p>
<p>be received.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General.  I submit, my Lords, that this is evi-
</p>
<p>dence. It is quite unnecessary for me to repeat the argument which
</p>
<p>I urged against the former objection, because the Court was of opi-
</p>
<p>nion that it was well founded. That, I apprehend, puts an end to
</p>
<p>this question.

</p>
<p>resolution, at the Association, which has reference to this document ?
</p>
<p>The Attorney General There is, my Lord. Besides, there is,
</p>
<p>in the bill of particulars, a reference to a newspaper which contains
</p>
<p>this document. It is copied, verbatim, in the Nation of a particular
</p>
<p>date, which is mentioned. I am not bound to produce that paper
</p>
<p>now. But I rely on the former decision, and on the principle on
</p>
<p>which the former evidence was admitted. I entirely deny that it was
</p>
<p>ever heard of, that in a case of conspiracy, a list of documents should
</p>
<p>be furnished. When there are general counts in the indictment the
</p>
<p>prosecutor may be called on to furnish a bill of particulars, but I never
</p>
<p>before heard of a list of documents being furnished. In Watson's
</p>
<p>case, papers which were found in the house of a co-conspirator, and
</p>
<p>which had reference to the design of the conspiracy, were allowed to
</p>
<p>be given in evidence. Even an overt act is not to be excluded if it
</p>
<p>be in support of an overt act stated in the indictment. The bill of
</p>
<p>particulars is not that we intend to give in evidence acts. The rule
</p>
<p>212
</p>
<p>of law is stated, and the authorities are collected, in Phiilips on Evi-
</p>
<p>dence. The principle is decided in Watson's case, that any act done
</p>
<p>by one of the parties, in pursuance of the original concerted plan,
</p>
<p>and with reference to the common object, is, in contemplation of the
</p>
<p>law, the act of the whole party. This document, which is explanatory
</p>
<p>of the Members' cards, appears to have been printed under the direc-
</p>
<p>tion of the Association, through Mr. Kay, its Secretary. It is,
</p>
<p>therefore, admissible against every member of it. By what has been
</p>
<p>already read it appears that this card is in the nature of a receipt for
</p>
<p>the subscription.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  I shall trouble your Lordships but with few obser-
</p>
<p>vations in support of this objection. I quite agree with the Attorney
</p>
<p>General that if it be admissible against one, it is admissible against
</p>
<p>all the traversers, but I submit that it is not admissible against any
</p>
<p>of them. The Attorney General has alleged that this document
</p>
<p>comes within the bill of particulars, because it is contained in one
</p>
<p>of the newspapers which have been referred to in the bill of par-
</p>
<p>ticulars. For aught that appears, this document may not be the
</p>
<p>same as that which is copied in the newspaper. We do not admit
</p>
<p>that it is. Then it is said, and it has been repeated, that if one
</p>
<p>overt act be specified in the indictment, you may give in evidence ano-
</p>
<p>ther overt act not specified. That may be so, but I say, that when a bill
</p>
<p>of particulars is furnished, the party is bound by it. When he says, he
</p>
<p>will rely on certain acts, that amounts to an averment that he will rely
</p>
<p>on them alone, and on none other. What is the overt act specified in
</p>
<p>the bill of particulars, of which this is evidence ? That has not been
</p>
<p>stated, and I am entitled to call on the other side to point it out.
</p>
<p>If they have not done so, I am entitled to assume that there is
</p>
<p>no such overt act. I admit that if there had been no bill of par-
</p>
<p>ticulars, this evidence would have been admissible. I admit, also,
</p>
<p>that there might have been no obligation on the Crown, to fur-
</p>
<p>nish a bill of particulars; but they have done so, and that is tan-
</p>
<p>tamount to a compliance with an order of the Court. I know not
</p>
<p>where they found the precedent for this bill of particulars, but

</p>
<p>here it is; your Lordships will observe the form of this indictment;
</p>
<p>it states the different meetings and the dates of them, and the acts
</p>
<p>done and the letters and other documents read at them. They now
</p>
<p>seek to read certain documents which were not read or referred to
</p>
<p>at any of those meetings. The bill of particulars refers to certain
</p>
<p>newspapers, and states that the Crown will rely on the fact of the print-
</p>
<p>ing, publishing, and contents of those newspapers, and yet I am told
</p>
<p>it contains nothing but the charges. Now, my Lords, the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General has endeavoured to bring the case within the charge for the
</p>
<p>collection of money. Let me call your Lordships' attention to the
</p>
<p>mode in which that overt act is stated in the indictment, it is, that
</p>
<p>the traversers "on the 1st of March, 1843, and on divers other days
</p>
<p>" and times before and after that day, and at divers other places in
</p>
<p>" divers other parts of Ireland, did seek to carry on the alleged con-
</p>
<p>" spiracy by meeting, collecting money, making seditious speeches,
</p>
<p>" and adopting resolutions." Is it possible to say that this mode of
</p>
<p>213
</p>
<p>stating the overt act lets in such evidence as this? Is it evidence of
</p>
<p>money being received at divers other places and times ?
</p>
<p>The Solicitor General.  My Lords, this is the same objection as
</p>
<p>that which the Court has just overruled in a different and rather
</p>
<p>more ingenious shape. It is confounding what is matter of charge
</p>
<p>with what is matter of evidence. The test of the admissibility of the
</p>
<p>evidence is this, is it applicable to any part of the charges in the in-
</p>
<p>dictment ? The gist and substance of the objection is, that the tra-
</p>
<p>versers have been taken by surprise. There is a count charging those
</p>
<p>persons, members of this confederacy, with carrying on the alleged
</p>
<p>conspiracy by collecting money. We offer, on the part of the Crown,
</p>
<p>a written or printed document, having proved it to have been printed
</p>
<p>by order of one of the traversers and one of the persons engaged in
</p>
<p>this confederacy ; and therefore it is an act done by one of the al-
</p>
<p>leged conspirators in furtherance of the common design attributed to
</p>
<p>them : and I pledge myself that it contains evidence of the object
</p>
<p>which these parties had in view. In 1 Phillips on Evidence, 492, the
</p>
<p>rule is laid down, referring to Hardy's Case ; in the same case, evidence
</p>
<p>was admitted to prove that Thelwall, who was a member of the cor-
</p>
<p>responding society with the prisoner, had brought a paper with him to
</p>
<p>a printer, and desired him to print it. The paper being considered as
</p>
<p>evidence to prove a circumstance, in the conspiracy. So, in the same
</p>
<p>manner, the fact of Mr. Ray taking this paper to the printer, is ad-
</p>
<p>missible in evidence  It is precisely this case : 
</p>
<p>" Mutato nomine, dete
</p>
<p>Fabula narratur."
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  I think when you come to analyse
</p>
<p>the present question, it comes to precisely the same principle as that
</p>
<p>on which we have just made our decision. I really do not see, when
</p>
<p>one comes to understand the matter, that there is any difference be-
</p>
<p>tween the two cases. How does the case stand ? Suppose the for-
</p>

</p>
<p>which are specified. The indictment contains a great number of

<p>counts. Many of these counts contain specific acts said to have been
</p>
<p>done by the traversers in furtherance and support of the common
</p>
<p>object of the conspiracy. Other counts are in general terms only, al-
</p>
<p>leging a general conspiracy with a particular end, but not setting
</p>
<p>forth the overt acts. Now if the indictment rested solely on the
</p>
<p>first branch of counts which I have specified, which state the com-
</p>
<p>mon object, and the acts done in furtherance of it, the traversers
</p>
<p>would not have been entitled to call on the Attorney General
</p>
<p>for a bill of particulars at all ; but in regard that overt acts are
</p>
<p>not laid in other counts, the traversers call on the Crown to fur.
</p>
<p>nish a bill of particulars, which they would restrict, not only to the
</p>
<p>subject matter of the charge, but also to the evidence therein stated.
</p>
<p>That appears to me to be a great mistake, and not the meaning of the
</p>
<p>bill of particulars in question. I have already said, that if there
</p>
<p>was nothing in the indictment but the special counts, or those which
</p>
<p>contained specific overt acts, the traversers would not be entitled to
</p>
<p>214
</p>
<p>a bill of particulars at all. The bill of particulars furnished in this
</p>
<p>case states, that " in addition to the several matters and things set
</p>
<p>"out in the first count of the indictment, it is intended to give in evi-
</p>
<p>" dence in support of the prosecution the speeches made, the resolu.
</p>
<p>" tions moved or adopted, the acts done, the letters and other docu-
</p>
<p>" merits read, and the several proceedings which occurred and took
</p>
<p>" place at each and every of the several meetings in the said fii\st count
</p>
<p>"specified or referred to, and any entries of the said several proceed-
</p>
<p>ings made by the defendants or any of them, or by the directions
</p>
<p>" of them or any of them, and the manner and order in which the
</p>
<p>" persons composing said several meetings respectively went thereto,
</p>
<p>" and also the speeches made, the resolutions proposed or adopted,
</p>
<p>" the acts done, the letters and other documents read, and the several
</p>
<p>" proceedings which occurred or took place at each of the seve-
</p>
<p>" ral occasions following, that is to say," &c. It then details the
</p>
<p>different meetings ; but this notice, given by the bill of particu-
</p>
<p>lars, does not at all alter the position in which the Crown stood,
</p>
<p>independently of the bill of particulars, with regard to those
</p>
<p>counts which contain, each of them, an overt act, giving a specifica-
</p>
<p>tion, a particular statement of a particular state of facts, in accor-
</p>
<p>dance with the general charge made in the indictment. Supposing
</p>
<p>there were none but those special counts, how would the matter have
</p>
<p>stood, if this evidence had been then offered ? It would have been
</p>
<p>relevant evidence, going strongly, if believed, in support of the
</p>
<p>charge under the special counts, that these parties, with one general
</p>
<p>intent, entered into a conspiracy with the view of doing so and so,
</p>
<p>specifying the particular thing. Supposing there was no bill of par-
</p>
<p>ticulars, would it be argued or alleged that this evidence was not sus-
</p>
<p>tainable in support of those counts of the indictment which are called
</p>
<p>special counts. Nobody could doubt for a moment that this would
</p>
<p>have been admissible evidence. I am not speaking of the effect cf the
</p>
<p>evidence one way or the other; as I read the bill of particulars, what
</p>
<p>has been given by it appears on the face of it to have been intended by
</p>
<p>the parties as an addition. Clearly there has been no surprise on any of

</p>
<p>the traversers if you take the case as standing on the special counts,
</p>
<p>if this paper had been offered in evidence against them, because it
</p>
<p>is clearly admissible on the special counts. The bill of particulars is
</p>
<p>not in respect of the special counts at all. It is in relation to some-
</p>
<p>thing else, and it is not necessary for us to consider the general counts
</p>
<p>at all ; all we have to consider is whether this is admissible against
</p>
<p>the traversers under the special counts. In this there is no surprise.
</p>
<p>The question, whether it is evidence in support of the indictment,
</p>
<p>was not gone into by the traversers' counsel, the ground that was
</p>
<p>taken by them was, that there is a bill of particulars, and that this
</p>
<p>evidence does not come within it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Burton and Mr. Justice Crampton concurred
</p>
<p>with the Lord Chief Justice.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin I am clearly of opinion, as I before sta-
</p>
<p>ted, that upon the indictment as originally framed, this evidence is
</p>
<p>admissible ; but I have as strong an opinion that it does not come
</p>
<p>215
</p>
<p>within that specified in the bill of particulars. However, it being
</p>
<p>understood that the bill of particulars relates merely to the other
</p>
<p>counts in the indictment, it cannot effect the rule with regard
</p>
<p>to the first count ; certainly, on reading the bill of particulars, I can-
</p>
<p>not say that it is confined to the latter count, for it refers to several
</p>
<p>matters and things contained in the first count. But I do not think
</p>
<p>that material to the view which I have taken. It is on the general
</p>
<p>ground that the bill of particulars does not affect this question, that I
</p>
<p>concur in the ruling of the Court, that the evidence ought to be ad-
</p>
<p>mitted under the first count. That is the only count that has overt
</p>
<p>acts specified in it.

</p>
<p>" planatory of the new Card for Members, by the Author of the

<p>" Green Book. Printed for Circulation by Order of the Com-
</p>
<p>" mittee of the Association ; April Wth, 1843.
</p>
<p>"Nation Office, March 13, 1843.
</p>
<p>" My dear Sir,
</p>
<p>" I beg leave to submit, along with the Members' new card,
</p>
<p>M to be laid before the Association to-day, the following descrip-
</p>
<p>" tion of the design on that document, and to accompany it with
</p>
<p>" such explanatory remarks as may tend to obviate any misconcep-
</p>
<p>" tion or misrepresentation that might otherwise be indulged in on
</p>
<p>" the subject. The object of the design for that card, has been the
</p>
<p>" concentration of such national emblems, with statistical and histo-
</p>
<p>" rical circumstances, as to render it, as far as possible, a manual of
</p>
<p>" our reasons for demanding legislative independence ; that until
</p>
<p>" confuted  and it cannot be so, must make every Irishman who
</p>
<p>" reads it, unless he be a corruptionist, a fool, or a coward, an ad-
</p>
<p>" vocate for the claim of Ireland to be ruled by Irish laws, and Irish
</p>
<p>" laws alone.
</p>
<p>" The border or frame work of the card is composed of two pil-
</p>
<p>" lars, connected at the top and bottom by the representation of slabs,
</p>
<p>" suited for inscriptions.

<p>" On the top slab is contained this inscription :  Resolved
</p>
<p>" unanimously, That a claim of any body of men other than the
</p>
<p>" King, Lords, and Commons o/Treland, to make laws to bind
</p>
<p>" this kingdom, is unconstitutional, illegal, and a grievance.'  Dun-
</p>
<p>" gannon Volunteers, 15th February, 1782. The united ele-
</p>
<p>" ments of the old regal, aristocratic, and democratic constitution of
</p>
<p>" Ireland, as acknowledged and confirmed in the time of our fathers,
</p>
<p>" to the exclusion of any thing like separation, are here set forth
</p>
<p>" as those for whose restoration, accompanied by such changes as the
</p>
<p>" present times may render necesssary, the Irish people are now
</p>
<p>" seeking. On the bottom of the slab is engraved : i You may make
</p>
<p>" the Union a law, but you cannot make it binding on conscience.'
</p>
<p>"  Saurin's Speech.
</p>
<p>" The force of such an opinion against the validity of the Union,
</p>
<p>21G
</p>
<p>" as that of the Tory or Orange Attorney General of Ireland for so
</p>
<p>" many years, needs no comment.
</p>
<p>" The interior part of the card, or that within the pillars to the
</p>
<p>" right and left, as well as the slabs at the top and bottom, contains
</p>
<p>" the words, Loyal National Repeal Association of Ireland ;
</p>
<p>" the word ' Ireland,' being placed over a small geographical repre-
</p>
<p>" sentation or map of ' our own little island,' and beneath this, at a
</p>
<p>" due distance, are the words constituting the usual form of admission
</p>
<p>" for Members to the Association, when the necessary blanks shall
</p>
<p>" have been filled up. Then from the pediment of each pillar,
</p>
<p>" slanting upwards towards the engraved map of Ireland, two flag-
</p>
<p>" staffs issue. The flag on the right bears the figure of a Shamrock,
</p>
<p>" on one leaf of which is the word ' Catholic,' on the next, ' Dis-
</p>
<p>" senter', and on the third, ' Protestant,' and then running up
</p>
<p>" through the centre, the motto, ' Quis separabit ?' or, ' Who shall
</p>
<p>" disunite usF' These, I need scarcely observe, are the words
</p>
<p>" which the advocates of Irish provincial debasement, as embodied
</p>
<p>" in the so-called Act of Union, place about its knavish and un-
</p>
<p>" natural type, a combination of the Shamrock with the Rose and
</p>
<p>" Thistle,  three things that would never have been joined, had
</p>
<p>" Irishmen endeavoured to act on the principle of 'Quis separabit?'
</p>
<p>" in the sense attached to it in the shamrock. The other flag,
</p>
<p>" or that issuing from the pediment of the left column, displays
</p>
<p>" a representation of the ' Sun-burst,' or the ancient royal banner
</p>
<p>* of Ireland, on which the sun was seen partly issuing, and his rays
</p>
<p>" streaming on every side, through the clouds surrounding him, 
</p>
<p>" no bad figure, by the way, of the present bright hopes and pros-
</p>
<p>" pects of our noble country, notwithstanding the darkness of do-
</p>
<p>" mestic disunion, and foreign oppression, which too long dimmed
</p>
<p>" the brilliant light of national prosperity, that, under other circum-
</p>
<p>u stances, would have vivified and adorned her.
</p>
<p>" On the shaft of the left column is this inscription : ' Ireland
</p>

</p>
<p>" Upon the capitals and pediments of the two pillars, on the shafts
</p>
<p>" of which are the above inscriptions, the names and dates are given
</p>
<p>" of four of the most remarkable victories gained by the Irish 'at
</p>
<p>" home,' when their calumniating English and Anglo-Irish oppres-
</p>
<p>" sors, in their collections of disgusting lies, miscalled histories,
</p>
<p>" so long thought proper, for sufficiently intelligible motives, to
</p>
<p>" scribble that Irishmen always fought badly.
</p>
<p>" The victories on the left hand column are thus set forth :
</p>
<p>'" Clontarf, 23rd April, 1014;' ' Beal-an-Atha Buidhe, 10th
</p>
<p>" August, 1598.'
</p>
<p>" The victories upon the right hand column are : ' Benburb, 5th
</p>
<p>" June, 1645.'  < Limerick, 9th to 31st August, 1690.'
</p>
<p>" The first of those victories, Clontarf, was fought between a
</p>
<p>" confederate force of 24,000 Danes and Lagenians, under Maol-
</p>
<p>" morde, the traitorous King of Leinster, the celebrated Brod Er,
</p>
<p>" commander of the Danish fleet, and several other Danish princes
</p>
<p>" and leaders of eminence, on one side; and an Irish army, inferior
</p>
<p>" in number, composed of the forces of Munster, Connaught, and
</p>
<p>" some Ulster chieftains, under the illustrious Brian Boru, monarch
</p>
<p>" of Ireland, and his heroic son Murrough O'Brien, on the other.
</p>
<p>" The object of the Heathen Danes, who at this period determined
</p>
<p>" to make up for the failure of their constant attempts during above
</p>
<p>" 200 years, to conquer Ireland, bears too strong a resemblance to
</p>
<p>" the subsequent conduct of another country towards us, not to be
</p>
<p>" mentioned : ' They invaded' says a cotemporary French Chroni-
</p>
<p>" cler, 'with an innumerable fleet, and accompanied by their wives,
</p>
<p>" ' their children, and their Christian captives, whom they reduced to
</p>
<p>" ' their slaves, the island Hiber?iia,\\ke\v\se called Irlanda, in order
</p>
<p>" < that the Irish being exterminated, they might colonize
</p>
<p>" ' that most opulent country for themselves !' And the in-
</p>
<p>" vaders did ' colonize' or get lands for themselves in Ireland, though
</p>
<p>" in a very different sense from what they wished. For on their
</p>
<p>" ' meeting' with the Irish at Clontarf, which lasted from sunrise
</p>
<p>" until late in the evening, and in which Paddy, it will be recollected,

<p>" had to fight fasting, as it was a good Friday ; the Danes and their
</p>
<p>" anti-national confederates (for then, as now, renegade Irishmen
</p>
<p>" were found on the foreigner's side) lost, in klled, and drowned,
</p>
<p>" 13,800 out of their 24,500 men ! The Irish, though their loss in
</p>
<p>" leaders, including their venerable monarch, was heavy, had no more
</p>
<p>" than about 4000 of their private men slain. And this signal
</p>
<p>" triumph, over the enemies of their country and religion, was gained
</p>
<p>" by Irishmen, at a time when the English were reduced to the
</p>
<p>" basest slavery by the Danes, who imposed four successive Danish
</p>
<p>" kings upon the English throne. The honest Tipperary moun-
</p>
<p>" taineer in last week's Nation, might well write :
</p>
<p>" Oh ! these heartless oppressors of Saxon extraction 
</p>
<p>How at all do they keep us to languish in chains ?
</p>
<p>When we conquer'J their betters, by far, in an action
</p>
<p>That smash'd into powder the plundering Danes !"

</p>
<p>2f
</p>
<p>218
</p>
<p>" Mouth of the yellow Ford, was gained over the English in their infa-
</p>
<p>" mous attempt during Elizabeth's reign, to put down the religion
</p>
<p>" of the Irish people, as well as to take their land from them, after
</p>
<p>" the manner of the Heathen Danes above mentioned. The Eng-
</p>
<p>" lish army, commanded by Eield Marshal Sir Henry Bagnal, was
</p>
<p>*' composed of veterans who had served with honour in the French
</p>
<p>" and Belgian wars. It consisted of 4,500 foot, and from 500 to
</p>
<p>" 600 horse. These troops were all in the finest condition, glittering
</p>
<p>" in steel, brass, or gold ; furnished with the best fire-arms and artil-
</p>
<p>"lery; their cavalry consisting of cuirassiers; and they had with
</p>
<p>" them a long train of baggage-animals carrying, besides money, an
</p>
<p>" ample stock of bread, biscuit, meat, and every other necessary for
</p>
<p>" the relief of their garrison of 300 men in the fort of Portmore, near
</p>
<p>" Armagh, which the gallant Hugh Ferdinand O'Neill (called in
</p>
<p>" English, Earl of Tyrone), was besieging. The Irish troops also
</p>
<p>" amounted to 4,500 foot, and about 600 horse ; but they consisted
</p>
<p>" merely of the followers of their chieftains, summoned from their
</p>
<p>" homes. They had very few guns, no artillery, and, with the ex-
</p>
<p>" ception of their chiefs, had no armour amongst them ; their wea-
</p>
<p>" pons being bows and arrows, darts, swords, axes, and pikes. They
</p>
<p>" conquered, however. The English general, Bagnal, with twenty-
</p>
<p>" three superior officers, a number of lieutenants, ensigns, &c, and
</p>
<p>" 2,500 men, were found dead upon the field ; thirty-four standards,
</p>
<p>" 12,000 pieces of gold, all the artillery, provisions, the musical in-
</p>
<p>'' struments of the enemy, and other trophies, were captured on that
</p>
<p>" glorious day ; and in fine, such of the English as remained toge-
</p>
<p>" ther, consisting of but 1,500 men, took refuge in Armagh, and were
</p>
<p>" only permitted to evacuate Ulster, on the condition of surrender-
</p>
<p>" ing both Armagh and Portmore, and of going away with nothing
</p>
<p>" but the clothes on their backs; their commander alone being per-
</p>
<p>" mitted to carry off his armour and trunk. The Irish, on this memo-
</p>
<p>" rable occasion, had but 200 men killed, and 600 wounded. The
</p>
<p>" third victory, or that of Benburb, was gained by the Irish, in the
</p>
<p>" reign of Charles the First, against the Parliamentary or Crom-

<p>" wellian ' rebels' of England and Scotland. The Irish forces under
</p>
<p>" the illustrious Major-General Owen Roe O'Neill, were but 5000
</p>
<p>" men in number, of whom 4,500 were foot, and 500 horse, the lat-
</p>
<p>" ter very badly equipped. The English and Scotch, under Gene-
</p>
<p>" ral Munro (who was so sure of carrying all before him, that he had
</p>
<p>" decided on being in twelve days in Kilkenny, and on driving the
</p>
<p>" Supreme Council, or the National Assembly of Ireland from
</p>
<p>" it), amounted to 8000 foot, and 800 well accoutred cavalry. They
</p>
<p>" had likewise a train of artillery, variously stated at from four to seven
</p>
<p>" pieces, while we are not informed that the Irish had any. The
</p>
<p>" Irish, nevertheless, on coming ' to push a pike ' against the ' rebels,'
</p>
<p>" left 3,245 of the enemy slain upon the spot, besides as many more
</p>
<p>11 as made 4000 in the course of the pursuit. In addition to the
</p>
<p>" parliamentary or 'rebel' officers killed, the Irish captured Lord
</p>
<p>" Montgomery, twenty-one other officers, 150 privates, with all the hos-
</p>
<p>" tile artillery, arms, tents, baggage, eighty-two stand of colours, 1500
</p>
<p>219
</p>
<p>" draught horses, and provisions for two months. The Parliament-
</p>
<p>" ary General Munro was obliged to save himself by such a preci-
</p>
<p>" pitate flight, that his coat, hat, and wig were left behind him!
</p>
<p>" Of the Irish officers, but two were killed and three wounded, and
</p>
<p>" of the Irish soldiers, no more than thirty-five were slain, and 245
</p>
<p>" hurt ! Considering that we have English and Anglo-Orange autho-
</p>
<p>" rity for the statement, ' that the Irish always fight badly at home,
</p>
<p>" this was doing pretty well.
</p>
<p>" The circumstances of the last triumph of Ireland, noted in the
</p>
<p>" Members' new card, or that over the Prince of Orange (afterwards
</p>
<p>" William III.), and from 30 to 35,000 veterans, at Limerick, a town
</p>
<p>" so badly provided with the usual requisites for military defence,
</p>
<p><' that the French general, Lausun, on abandoning it to the Irish in
</p>
<p>" despair, swore it ivould be taken by pelting it with roasted apples !
</p>
<p>" The circumstances of that memorable achievement of Irish he-
</p>
<p>" roism, both on the part of Irish men and Irish women, are too
</p>
<p>" well known to be dwelt upon. I need only observe, that after
</p>
<p>" remaining before the place from the 9th to the 31st of August,1690,
</p>
<p>11 the besiegers retreated in the night, having lost, in addition to
</p>
<p>" officers, above 5,000 in killed alone ; their wounded and sick not
</p>
<p>" being specified, but unquestionably three times as many. The
</p>
<p>" Irish had 1,062 soldiers, and 97 officers killed or wounded.
</p>
<p>" Such were the noble achievements of Irish prowess on Irish
</p>
<p>" ground, when physical, and not moral force alone, as at present,
</p>
<p>" constituted the medium of defending Irish liberty. To the latter
</p>
<p>" peaceful, legal, and constitutional means for regaining their lost
</p>
<p>" legislative rights, under the bloodless, yet irresistible guidance of
</p>
<p>" their great leader, O'Connell, Irishmen now look forward ; though,
</p>
<p>** in the above instances of martial devotion to the cause of Ireland,
</p>
<p>" they have no less reason to honour the memory of those gallant
</p>
<p>" men, who acted upon the sacred principle of Roman patriotism 
</p>
<p>" ' Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori !'
</p>
<p>" I remain, my dear Sir,

<p>" ciation, on the motion of Mr. O'Connell."
</p>
<p>MONDAY, January 2nd.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  I am sorry to say that Mr. Justice
</p>
<p>Burton is prevented by a severe cold from coming down to Court
</p>
<p>and taking his seat on the Bench.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell  In consequence of what has fallen from your
</p>
<p>Lordship, namely, that Judge Burton is unable to attend court, ow-
</p>
<p>220
</p>
<p>ing to indisposition, I, upon behalf of the traversers, in connexion
</p>
<p>with the other counsel engaged for them, object to the trial being
</p>
<p>proceeded with but before a full Court.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice  We will take a note of your objection.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General.  No difficulty whatever can arise from the
</p>
<p>absence of his Lordship, as it was expressly decided in the Bristol
</p>
<p>riot case, The King v. Finney, that where one of the Judges took
</p>
<p>ill, the trial could be proceeded with in his absence. There was a
</p>
<p>document proved by Mr. Browne the printer, on Saturday, the en-
</p>
<p>tire of which I will not require to have read, as it has been proved
</p>
<p>and read by one of the witnesses already examined, from the mani-
</p>
<p>fold copies  I allude to the plan for the renewed action of the Irish
</p>
<p>Parliament ; however, if there is any wish expressed I will not object
</p>
<p>to its being read again.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connett.  Read the whole of it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  What can be the use of reading a doc-
</p>
<p>ument which we have on our notes already ?
</p>
<p>Mr. O' Connell Only part of it, my Lord, has been read alrea-
</p>
<p>dy, and it is a very important document.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General  Then read it fully.
</p>
<p>[The Clerk of the Crown then read the Report of a Committee of
</p>
<p>the Repeal Association, signed " Daniel O'Connell, Chairman," for
</p>
<p>the renewed action of the Irish Parliament, which was as follows :]
</p>
<p>" Plan for the renewed Action of the Irish Parliament.
</p>
<p>" Firstly The Irish people recognize, acknowledge, maintain,
</p>
<p>" and will continually preserve and uphold upon the throne of Ireland
</p>
<p>" Her Majesty Queen Victoria, whom God protect ! Queen by un-
</p>
<p>" doubted right, and by hereditary descent, of Ireland, and her heirs
</p>
<p>" and successors for ever.
</p>
<p>" The people of Ireland recognize, acknowledge, maintain, and
</p>
<p>" will continually preserve and uphold all the prerogatives of Her
</p>
<p>" Majesty and of her heirs and successors, belonging to, and in-
</p>
<p>" herent in, the imperial Crown of Ireland ; and they will true alle-
</p>
<p>" giance bear, pure, undivided, and indivisible to Her Majesty, her

</p>
<p>" heirs and successors for ever.
</p>
<p>" Secondly.  The people of Ireland acknowledge, and will main-
</p>
<p>" tain and preserve for ever the privileges, hereditary and personal, of
</p>
<p>" the peers of Ireland, together with the legislative and judicial au-
</p>
<p>" thority of the Irish House of Lords, and the exercise of the prero-
</p>
<p>" gative in augmenting and limiting the peerage, as the same did of
</p>
<p>" right exist before the year 1800.
</p>
<p>" Thirdly.  The people of Ireland do firmly insist upon the res-
</p>
<p>" toration of the Irish House of Commons, consisting of three hun-
</p>
<p>" dred representatives of the Irish people ; and claim, in the presence
</p>
<p>" of their Creator, the right of the people of Ireland to such resto-
</p>
<p>" ration.
</p>
<p>" They have submitted to the Union as being binding as a law;
</p>
<p>" but they declare solemnly that it is not founded on right, or on con-
</p>
<p>" stitutional principle, and that it is not obligatory upon conscience.
</p>
<p>221
</p>
<p>" They agree with the Tory Attorney-General, Saurin, that the ouly
</p>
<p>" binding power of the Union is the strength of the English domina-
</p>
<p>" tion. They also agree with him that 'resistance to the Union is
</p>
<p>" in the abstract a duty, and the exhibition of that resistance a mere
</p>
<p>" question of prudence.' They will therefore resist the Union by
</p>
<p>" all legal, peaceful, and constitutional means.
</p>
<p>" Fourthly.  The plan for the restoration of the Irish Parliament
</p>
<p>u is as follows. Firstly, That the county members should be increased
</p>
<p>" to 173, in the manner hereinafter specified. Second! y, That there
</p>
<p>" should be 127 members returned from cities and towns, in manner
</p>
<p>" hereinafter mentioned. Thirdly, That the county of Callow, being
</p>
<p>" the only county in Ireland with less than 100,000 inhabitants, should
</p>
<p>" get an increase of one member, so as to have three representatives;
</p>
<p>" that every other county having above 100,000 inhabitants should
</p>
<p>" get an increase of two members.
</p>
<p>'' That every county ranging above 150,000 inhabitants should
</p>
<p>" get an increase of three members.
</p>
<p>" That every county ranging above 250,000 inhabitants should
</p>
<p>" gel an increase of four members.
</p>
<p>" That the county of Tipperary, having more than 400,000 in-
</p>
<p>" habitants, but less than 500,000, should get an increase of eight
</p>
<p>" members.
</p>
<p>" That the county of Cork, having more than 700,000 inhabitants,
</p>
<p>" should get an increase of ten members.
</p>
<p>" Fifthly.  With respect to the towns and cities. It is proposed
</p>
<p>" that the city of Dublin, having more than 200,000 inhabitants,
</p>
<p>" should have eight representatives  four for the parts north of the
</p>
<p>" Liffey, and four for the parts south of the Liffey.
</p>
<p>" That the University of Dublin should continue, on the basis of
</p>
<p>" its present constituency, to send two members.
</p>
<p>" It is proposed that the City of Cork, having more than 100,000
</p>
<p>" inhabitants, should have five members.
</p>
<p>" That the city of Limerick and town of Belfast, having respec-
</p>
<p>" tively more than 50,000 inhabitants, should send four members

<p>" each.
</p>
<p>" It is proposed that the town of Galway, and the cities of Water-
</p>
<p>" ford and Kilkenny, having respectively more than 20,000 inhabi-
</p>
<p>" tants, should send each three members to Parliament.
</p>
<p>" That other towns having 7,000 inhabitants, should each send
</p>
<p>" two members to Parliament ; and that 49 other towns, next highest
</p>
<p>" in ratio of population, should send one member each.
</p>
<p>" The following schedule of the different places to return mem-
</p>
<p>" bers to the Irish Parliament, will show their relative population,
</p>

<p>" been made for a different purpose and without any reference what-
</p>
<p> ever to the repeal of the Union, furnish a scale of unquestionable
</p>
<p>" impartiality.
</p>
<p>" Sixthly.  It is proposed that the right of voting should be what
</p>
<p>" is called 'household suffrage,' requiring six months' residence in the
</p>
<p>" counties; with the addition in the towns of married men, resident
</p>
<p>" for twelve months, whether householders or not.

<p>" Eighthly The Monarch de facto of England, at all times here-

<p>" after, whoever he may be, shall be Monarch de jure in Ireland ;

</p>
<p>" to be regent de jure in Ireland.
</p>
<p>" Ninthly.  The connexion between Great Britain and Ireland,
</p>
<p>" by means of the power, authority, and prerogatives of the Crown,
</p>
<p>223
</p>
<p>" to be perpetual and incapable of cbange or any severance or sepa-
</p>
<p>" ration.
</p>
<p>" The foregoing plan to be carried into effect, according to re-
</p>
<p>" cognized law, and strict constitutional principle.
</p>
<p>" Signed by order,
</p>
<p>" Daniel O'Connell,
</p>
<p>" Chairman of the Committee?'
</p>
<p>He subsequently read the rules to be observed by Arbitrators
</p>
<p>appointed by the Repeal Association, to whom the people were to
</p>
<p>submit their disputes, also published by Mr. Browne, and proved on
</p>
<p>Saturday.
</p>
<p>The Deputy Clerk of the Crown then read the
</p>
<p>" Report of Sub- Committee appointed on the 17th Day of August,
</p>
<p>" 1843, to consider and report on the Adoption of a general System
</p>
<p>" of Arbitration throughout the Country.
</p>
<p>" Your Committee having carefully considered the several ques-
</p>
<p>" tions referred to them with respect to the introduction of a system
</p>
<p>" of arbitration throughout Ireland, with a view to the better ad-
</p>
<p>justment of all disputes that may from time to time arise among
</p>
<p>" such of the inhabitants thereof as may be disposed to submit same
</p>
<p>" to Arbitrators, beg leave to offer the following Report thereon, for
</p>
<p>** the adoption of your Association :
</p>
<p>" Your Committee are strongly of opinion, that inasmuch as
</p>
<p>" many of the magistrates who possess popular confidence have been
</p>
<p>" deprived of the commission of the peace because of their attach-
</p>
<p>" ment to the cause of legislative independence, no unnecessary
</p>
<p>il time should be lost in carrying into practice the principle of arbi-
</p>
<p>" tration as already approved of by the unanimous vote of the
</p>
<p>" Association. In order, therefore, to secure the perfect and har-
</p>
<p>" monious working of such a system, your Committee recommend
</p>
<p>" that a standing Committee be immediately formed to arrange the
</p>
<p>" necessary details, prepare the requisite forms, and superintend the
</p>
<p>" practical working of the system after it shall have been put in
</p>
<p>M operation. Being further of opinion that the system of arbi-

</p>
<p>" tration should be as universally applied as the circumstances of
</p>
<p>" each locality will admit, your Committee recommend that for that
</p>
<p>" purpose the several counties be apportioned into districts, and
</p>
<p>" that three or more Arbitrators be recommended for each district,
</p>
<p>" the number to be determined by the extent, population, and such
</p>
<p>" other local circumstances as may seem to bear directly thereon.
</p>
<p>" In defining those districts, your Committee would suggest that
</p>
<p>" advantage be taken of the divisions at present established for
</p>
<p>" the purpose of petty sessions Courts, and recommend that those
</p>
<p>" districts be adopted, inasmuch as the peasantry are in general
</p>
<p>" familiarised thereto. Your Committee suggest that the dismissed
</p>
<p>" Magistrates, and such Repeal Justices as have resigned, be in
</p>
<p>" the first instance recommended as Arbitrators in their respec-
</p>
<p>" tive districts ; and that a dismissed Magistrate, or one who has
</p>
<p>224
</p>
<p>" resigned at present, be in all cases chosen as the Chairman of
</p>
<p>" the Court of Arbitration. Your Committee are strongly impressed
</p>
<p>" withthe conviction that in selecting persons to be intrusted with
</p>
<p>" such high and important functions as those that will necessarily
</p>
<p>" devolve upon the Arbitrators, the utmost diligence should be used to
</p>
<p>" procure persons not only of high moral character and local influence,
</p>
<p>" but who also possess the full and complete confidence of the several
</p>
<p>" classes upon whose cases they may have to arbitrate. For this pur-
</p>
<p>" pose they would suggest that the Repeal Wardens resident in the
</p>
<p><l several districts be called upon to recommend to the Association
</p>
<p>" such persons as may seem to them the best qualified to act as Ar-
</p>
<p>" bitrators, and that they be directed, in making their selection, to re-
</p>
<p>" quest the aid of the Repeal clergy and gentry in their several dis-
</p>
<p>" tricts. That the names of the persons so selected and approved of
</p>
<p>" be transmitted to the Association through the provincial Inspector
</p>
<p>" of Wardens, and be accompanied by a report from him on the qua-
</p>
<p>u lifications of the persons so recommended, and that such recom-
</p>
<p>" mendations and reports be referred for consideration to the Stand-
</p>
<p>" ing Committee.
</p>
<p>" In giving the sanction of your Association to the recommen-
</p>
<p>" dation of any Arbitrator, your Committee suggests that it be
</p>
<p>" given by vote of the Association, at one of the ordinary or
</p>
<p>" adjourned public meetings, on special motion made, and that of
</p>
<p>" such motion it is necessary that at least one week's public notice
</p>
<p>" be given. They further recommend that each Arbitrator, on the
</p>
<p>" vote of the Association being formally notified to him, shall
</p>
<p>" promise, as a Repealer, that he will arbitrate impartially on all cases
</p>
<p>" that may be referred to his decision. Your Committee would also
</p>
<p>" suggest that the Repeal Wardens of the district be requested to
</p>
<p>" recommend a person qualified and willing gratuitously to act as
</p>
<p>" Secretary to the district Arbitrators, and that it be the duty of such
</p>
<p>" Secretary as may be approved of by the Association, to keep,
</p>
<p>" under the direction and superintendence of the Arbitrators, a
</p>
<p>" book, in which proper minutes be kept of all proceedings had be-

</p>
<p>" fore the Court of Arbitration. Your Committee are also of opinion
</p>
<p>" that due publicity should be given in each district to the names of
</p>
<p>" the Arbitrators and the place of arbitration. With respect to the
</p>
<p>" mode of conducting the proceedings of the Courts of Arbitration,
</p>
<p>" your Committee recommend that the Arbitrators sit publicly in a
</p>
<p>" place or places to be named in their respective districts, on a cer-
</p>
<p>" tain fixed day, each week or fortnight, according to the peculiar
</p>
<p>" circumstances of the localities ; and that any person having any
</p>
<p>" difference with, or claim upon, another, shall serve notice upon
</p>
<p>" that other, calling upon him to come before the Arbitrators upon
</p>
<p>" the next day of sitting, and submit to have the matter in dispute
</p>
<p>" arbitrated upon ; and that there shall be appended to said notice a
</p>
<p>" further notification signed by one of the district Arbitrators, noti-
</p>
<p>" fying that the Arbitrators would sit for the adjustment of diffe-
</p>
<p>" rences on the clay specified. It is the opinion of your Committee
</p>
<p>" that the presence of three Arbitrators should be declared necessary
</p>
<p>225
</p>
<p>" to arbitrate upon each case, and that all questions be decided by
</p>
<p>" vote, the majority determining the decision, and that should a
</p>
<p>" greater number than three sit to arbitrate in any one case, and
</p>
<p>" that said number be an even number, that then the Chairman
</p>
<p>" should have two votes, and that in all other cases a majority of
</p>
<p>" the votes of the Arbitrators shall determine. Your committee
</p>
<p>" recommend that the parties be permitted to avail themselves of
</p>
<p>u professional aid whenever they consider it advisable. Your com-
</p>
<p>" mittee recommend that after the parties shall have appeared be-
</p>
<p>" fore the Arbitrators, a deed of submission be respectively signed
</p>
<p>" by them and duly witnessed, consenting to leave the matter in
</p>
<p>" dispute to the decision of the Arbitrators, and to abide by such
</p>
<p>" award as they may make. That the Arbitrators, having heard the
</p>
<p>" case and evidence adduced on both sides, make their award, which
</p>
<p>" award shall be final and conclusive, and that they endorse same upon
</p>
<p>" the deed of submission, and see that the proper entry of the proceed-
</p>
<p>" ingsbe made in the minute-book by the secretary, and that a copy
</p>
<p>" of the award be given to each party, and that the original deed of
</p>
<p>" submission and award be preserved. Your committee also recom-
</p>
<p>" mend that after the publication of the award, should either party
</p>
<p>" refuse to comply therewith, the party so refusing shall be reported
</p>
<p>" by the Arbitrators to the Association, and that the standing com-
</p>
<p>" mittee do then proceed to inquire into the cause of said refusal;
</p>
<p>" and that should the parties so refusing, fail to give satisfactory rea-
</p>
<p>" sons to the committee for such his refusal, the committee do re-
</p>
<p>" commend that the party so refusing, be expelled from the Associa-
</p>
<p>" tion by a public vote. Your committee would suggest that for the
</p>
<p>" better working of the system, the secretaries be required quarterly
</p>
<p>" to forward to the Association for inspection, the minute books ;
</p>
<p>" and further recommend that blank forms of notices, deeds of sub-
</p>
<p>" mission, minute books, and other such books and forms, be for-
</p>
<p>" warded, in the requisite quantities, to the several districts, free of
</p>
<p>" expense ; and that there be no charge made or fee received by the
</p>
<p>" Arbitrators, or any of them, or by their secretary, for any notice,

<p>Thomas Thacker sworn, and examined by Mr. Freeman, Q. C.
</p>
<p>I am a lithographic artist. I came to this country last March
</p>
<p>two years. I resided before in London. I know a person of the
</p>
<p>name of Holbrooke. Immediately on my coming to this country I
</p>
<p>was employed by him in taking sketches from scenery, and litho-
</p>
<p>graphing them. I was often employed in other work. The cards
</p>
<p>handed up are printed from stone. They were originally engraved
</p>
<p>on copper, partly by Mr. Gardner and partly by Mr. James. I could
</p>
<p>not say who struck off these particular cards. I have seen similar
</p>
<p>cards in great numbers, printed in Mr. Holbrooke's place, 4 Crow-
</p>
<p>street. Some thousands were printed. This card is similar to those
</p>
<p>printed in Mr. Holbrooke's place.
</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman.  The two cards handed up are those already
</p>
<p>proved, the Associates' card. I produce another card.
</p>
<p>Examination resumed.  I saw a similar card to that before. This
</p>
<p>is the Members' card. It is printed in the same manner ; originally
</p>
<p>engraved on copper, and impressions taken from the copperplate and
</p>
<p>transferred to the stone. This is a second printing. 1 put the co-
</p>
<p>lour on the stone, to enable the printer to print from it. It was
</p>
<p>done at Mr. Holbrooke's. A great number of this description were
</p>
<p>struck off. I put black on the stone ; the printer put on the green.
</p>
<p>I believe by Mr. Holbrooke's directions. The design is owing partly
</p>
<p>to myself. I designed the decorations and the flags, a Sham-
</p>
<p>rock and a Sun-burst. Mr. Holbrooke brought me a rough sketch
</p>
<p>of the design. No person was with him when the sketch was
</p>
<p>presented to me. Mr. O'Callaghan used to come up when Mr. Hol-
</p>
<p>brooke was giving instructions. I believe his Christian name is
</p>
<p>John Cornelius. Mr. Holbrooke told me so. I know Mr. Ray.
</p>
<p>I have seen him at Mr. Holbrooke's. I have no recollection of
</p>
<p>his being then with Mr. O'Callaghan. He has come and inspect-
</p>
<p>ed them, and suggested improvements, which were made. One
</p>
<p>alteration was as to the form of the harp on the Volunteers' card.
</p>
<p>No alteration was made at his suggestion in the Members' card. A
</p>
<p>suggestion was made by Mr. Ray as to improvement of the likeness

<p>of Mr. O'Connell. The lithograph Thomas M. Ray at the foot of
</p>
<p>that card is ajac simile of the handwriting of Mr. Ray. I have seen
</p>
<p>Mr. Ray write a few words. I cannot from what I have seen him
</p>
<p>write form an opinion of his handwriting. I sketched the likeness of
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Grattan, and Mr. Flood. I copied the likeness
</p>
<p>of Mr. Flood from a picture in the Dining Hall of the College. Mr.
</p>
<p>Davis accompanied me there. I copied the likeness of Owen Roe
</p>
<p>O'Neill from a print which Mr. O'Callaghan's brother brought to Mr.
</p>
<p>Holbrooke's. I have seen Mr. Davis several times at Mr. Hol-
</p>
<p>brooke's. The likeness of Brian Boroimhe I copied from the fron-
</p>
<p>tispiece in " Keating's History of Ireland." The likeness of Ollum
</p>
<p>Fodla I got from my imagination. Mr. Holbrooke suggested the
</p>
<p>name; it was frequently discussed by Mr. Davis, Mr. Holbrooke, and
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Callaghan. I cannot say whether Mr. Ray was present at the
</p>
<p>227
</p>
<p>time. I took the likeness of Sarsfield from an old French engraving
</p>
<p>in the possession of Mr. Geraghty, a bookseller. Mr. Holbrooke
</p>
<p>brought me to see it. It was Mr. Holbrooke's wish to have it put
</p>
<p>on the card. I cannot say Mr. Kay was present at the time. I
</p>
<p>think I composed the likeness of Hugh O'Neill, and that of Dathi.
</p>
<p>I have been at the Association, and have seen Mr. Ray there. This
</p>
<p>is the Repeal Wardens' diploma. I designed it from materials fur-
</p>
<p>nished by Mr. Holbrooke. It was completed before the Volun-
</p>
<p>teers' card. While this was designing, I saw Mr. Ray. I won't
</p>
<p>undertake to say that 1 heard a communication with regard to this
</p>
<p>diploma. While it was in progress, Mr. Holbrooke used to bring
</p>
<p>these several gentlemen to see it ; Mr. O'Callaghan, Mr. Davis,
</p>
<p>Mr. Ray. I think it was the other card Mr. Steele came to see. I
</p>
<p>cannot say which. No one was with him ; he came but once. He
</p>
<p>directed his conversation with regard to the cards to Mr. Hol-
</p>
<p>brooke. It was quite irrelevant to these diplomas. I knew Mr. Duffy.
</p>
<p>I have seen him at Holbrooke's. I have seen him come with Mr.
</p>
<p>Davis. I am not aware that he came with any person else. He came to
</p>
<p>a place appropriated for drawings, a kind of studio. He looked at the
</p>
<p>works. I do not remember his making any observation on them,
</p>
<p>but he looked at them. This was about the middle of last year.
</p>
<p>Mr. Duffy was up several times, but I cannot say how often. It
</p>
<p>was at the Repeal Association I took Mr. O'Connell's head. It was
</p>
<p>about the time the Volunteers' card was in progress. I saw Mr. John
</p>
<p>O'Connell at the Association. I first saw him at the Repeal As-
</p>
<p>sociation, near the table under the chair. I do not know whether
</p>
<p>I saw Mr. Ray on that occasion, but I have seen him there with Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell. I do not know whether Mr. O'Connell, Mr. John
</p>
<p>O'Connell, and Mr. Ray, were all present at the same time. I was
</p>
<p>there rarely except for sketching, six or seven times. I do not re-
</p>
<p>member seeing Mr. Duffy then, or Dr. Gray. I should know Dr.
</p>
<p>Gray if I saw him. I saw him at Mr. Holbrooke's, I believe he
</p>
<p>came up merely to inspect the work. I do not know Mr. Bar-
</p>
<p>rett. I recollect an alteration respecting the harp, and also in the

</p>
<p>cap of the chief, by Mr. Ray. This was in the diploma. When
</p>
<p>I went to the Association, Mr. Holbrooke accosted me. There
</p>
<p>was a mistake in the formation of the harp, as to the place
</p>
<p>where the strings were placed. The objection was that the harp
</p>
<p>was like an English and not an Irish harp. I had put a spike on the
</p>
<p>top of the cap. It was not a coronet. Mr. Ray suggested both these
</p>
<p>alterations. I had nothing to do with the striking off the diplo-
</p>
<p>mas. I cannot say how many were struck off. Many Associates'
</p>
<p>cards were struck off. They were sent to the Association after they
</p>
<p>were printed. John and Joseph Annesley printed the cards. I once
</p>
<p>saw a large quantity of the cards taken out by some boys who were
</p>
<p>employed at Mr. Holbrooke's. I was an enrolled Member of the
</p>
<p>Repeal Association, not by my own consent.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  How do you know ? I had a card put into
</p>
<p>my hand by Mr. Holbrooke. I sketched Mr. John O'Connell at the
</p>
<p>Repeal Association Room. It was according to appointment I met
</p>
<p>228
</p>
<p>him there. I was in the Committee room of the Repeal Association.
</p>
<p>I was there once, for the purpose of sketching a bust of Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell. 1 was paid for my services. I was paid by Mr. Holbrooke.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Macdonagh.
</p>
<p>I have been five years practising as an artist. I have frequently
</p>
<p>seen gentlemen at my study. A great many gentlemen have called
</p>
<p>there. I do not know Dathi. I believe he is only known to the
</p>
<p>Irish people. I think it is merely in their imagination. I have seen
</p>
<p>other persons than those I have named in my study. I have been
</p>
<p>in the service of Mr. Holbrooke since I came to Ireland. I knew
</p>
<p>he was engaged for Government business, in the Board of
</p>
<p>Works. He advertised it on his glass windows. It was the first
</p>
<p>thing that struck me. It was visible to every body that went into
</p>
<p>the passage. I did not know him to be employed by the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment before he was employed by the Repeal Association. He was
</p>
<p>employed by the Repeal Association and the Government at the
</p>
<p>same time. He used to do printing business for the Government.
</p>
<p>I saw the presses moving while I was employed about these cards.
</p>
<p>The Associates' card was designed by me and by Mr. Holbrooke. I
</p>
<p>would not knowingly design any thing injurious to my loyalty. I
</p>
<p>wag in the Dining Hall of the College to take Mr. Flood's likeness,
</p>
<p>and I did not think I was doing any thing disloyal. Mr. Flood was
</p>
<p>a contemporary of Mr. Grattan. I saw Mr. Steele at Mr. Holbrooke's.
</p>
<p>I do not know whether he was there about the title page of a book.
</p>
<p>I remember seeing Dr. Gray. He was inspecting the premises. He
</p>
<p>was looking at the presses. I do not know Mr. Barrett at all. My
</p>
<p>interview with Mr. John O'Connell was by private appointment, to
</p>
<p>take his likeness atMr. Holbrooke's desire. I have not seen Mr. Hol-
</p>
<p>brooke since I have been here. I came on Wednesday evening.
</p>
<p>I was in London since last August. I believe Mr. Holbrooke to be
</p>
<p>in Dublin now. I do not know where the Messrs. O'Callaghans are.
</p>
<p>I parted with Mr. Holbrooke voluntarily. I went to London to
</p>
<p>carry on my profession there.

</p>
<p>I am a writing engraver. I am an Englishman. I first came to
</p>
<p>Ireland last February. I was in Mr. Holbrooke's employment from
</p>
<p>the middle of February to the latter end of June, 1843. It is my
</p>
<p>business to draw letters on stone. I engraved the lettering on these
</p>
<p>cards at Mr. Holbrooke's, somewhere about March last. I exe-
</p>
<p>cuted the whole of the writing on the Associates' card for Mr. Hol-
</p>
<p>brooke. I engraved the whole of it. I did it before the Members'
</p>
<p>card. The columns and the banners were on the plate when I got
</p>
<p>it. Mr. Holbrooke gave me the work. I do not know Mr. Ray,
</p>
<p>or Mr. Duffy, or Mr. Steele. I cannot identify any of them. I put
</p>
<p>the name of Thomas M. Ray, from a supposed autograph of Mr. Ray.
</p>
<p>I had nothing more to do with the Volunteers' card than designing the
</p>
<p>writing. I cannot say who engraved it. I have the impressions with
</p>
<p>me. The Members' card was the first ; then the small card. The
</p>
<p>229
</p>
<p>Diploma was the next. I executed the writing on it. I saw several
</p>
<p>of the Diplomas printed. There is a stamp on the Members' card
</p>
<p>which was not there when it was printed. There is no stamp on the
</p>
<p>Diploma. I cannot say how many were printed. I had no share
</p>
<p>whatever in arranging the process for printing the colour. This is a
</p>
<p>eopy from the copper-plate which I produce.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Moore.
</p>
<p>I was in Mr. Holbrooke's employment from February to June. I
</p>
<p>came to Ireland in the middle of February, and entered immediately
</p>
<p>into Mr. Holbrooke's employment.
</p>
<p>To Mr. Martley  There was a person of the name of Annesley
</p>
<p>in Mr. Holbrooke's employment. I never saw him take any of the
</p>
<p>cards away after they were printed.
</p>
<p>To Mr. Moore.  Mr. Holbrooke did much business. He worked
</p>
<p>for the Government. I knew it. He had four persons connected
</p>
<p>with the printing and engraving in his employment. I received di-
</p>
<p>rections from Mr. Holbrooke in the ordinary course of business,
</p>
<p>and I so executed them. There was no concealment or mystery
</p>
<p>about it.
</p>
<p>John Annesley, examined by Mr. Smyley.
</p>
<p>I am a lithographic printer. I was in the employment of Mr.
</p>
<p>Holbrooke. I will not swear that I printed any of these (the Mem-
</p>
<p>bers' and Associates' cards), but I have printed similar ones. I put
</p>
<p>on the colour. I once took some of the small cards to the Corn
</p>
<p>Exchange. I cannot say to whom I delivered them. I had a pass
</p>
<p>book. When the cards were delivered initials were entered in the
</p>
<p>books by the person who received them in Mr. Ray's office. I can-
</p>
<p>not say how many of the cards I have printed. I have printed thou-
</p>
<p>sands of such. I printed the Arbitration Award. There was no
</p>
<p>stamp on it when I printed it. I do not know where the paper came
</p>
<p>from. I have printed such papers as the Deed of Submission to the
</p>
<p>Arbitrators. There were a good number done, the same as these. I
</p>
<p>never carried any of them to the Association.

<p>I have been four years in Mr. Holbrooke's employment. I do
</p>
<p>not know where the original die of the stamp on the award is. I
</p>
<p>have printed matters for Mr. Holbrooke for the Government. I
</p>
<p>never saw that stamp on papers printed for the Government. I saw
</p>
<p>the die of one of those stamps at Mr. Holbrooke's. I did not see it
</p>
<p>five, four, or three, or two years. I cannot fix the time when I saw
</p>
<p>it first. I will not venture to say I did not see it before 1843.
</p>
<p>Those papers were printed within the last four months. I do not re-
</p>
<p>collect ever seeing the die. I saw the stamp. I never saw the stamp
</p>
<p>on any other paper. I have delivered other work, but very seldom,
</p>
<p>for the Board of Works. There is no check on the delivery of the
</p>
<p>goods there.

<p>Joseph Annesley sworn, and examined by Mr. Baker.
</p>
<p>I know Mr. Holbrooke, and have been in his employment a year
</p>
<p>and six months. I have printed cards of the description of the Asso-
</p>
<p>ciates' cards, at Mr. Holbrooke's, not long ago. I brought parcels of
</p>
<p>these cards to the Corn Exchange. I left them at the top of the
</p>
<p>house, with two of the clerks. I do not know those of the office.
</p>
<p>I know a person of the name of Quigley. I have given cards to
</p>
<p>Quigley in the office. I do not know Mr. Ray. I do not know his
</p>
<p>appearance. I saw the Volunteers' cards brought to the Corn-Ex-
</p>
<p>change. I have seen documents such as the diploma brought to the
</p>
<p>Corn-Exchange, and delivered there.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. McCarthy.
</p>
<p>It was not my duty to make up parcels. I made up some of the
</p>
<p>small cards. I printed the Repeal Cards. Mr. Holbrooke is in town
</p>
<p>now. I am still in his employment.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown then read :
</p>
<p>" The Associates' Card."
</p>
<p> The Members' Card."
</p>
<p>" The Volunteers' Card."
</p>
<p>"The Diploma of the Repeal Wardens."
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon It was not proved that any paper having a
</p>
<p>stamp was ever delivered by a member of the Association. This
</p>
<p>has a stamp on it. This document, with a stamp on it, was never
</p>
<p>delivered to any member of the Association, nor was it recognised by
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin.  The stamp will not be read ; it does not
</p>
<p>characterise the instrument. It will not affect the meaning and im-
</p>
<p>port of the instrument.

<p>The Deputy Clerk of the Crown then read :

</p>
<p>I am a short-hand writer. I was present at a meeting at Tulla-
</p>
<p>more, on the 16th of July. I arrived there between three and four
</p>
<p>o'clock. The proceedings commenced about two o'clock. I saw

</p>
<p>many people coming into Tullamore. As far as I saw they came in
</p>
<p>in the same way they would come in on any other occasion. There
</p>
<p>was a great crowd there. I took a short-hand note of what passed.
</p>
<p>I transcribed the note, with the exception of some few sentences.
</p>
<p>My short-hand note is destroyed. I know two of the traversers,
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell and Mr. Steele. They attended that meeting. The
</p>
<p>Rev. Mr. O'Rafferty was Chairman.
</p>
<p>Mr. Tomb.  State what the Chairman said.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell.  Do you mean to state that the transcript is an
</p>
<p>accurate verbatim translation of your short-hand notes ? It is, with
</p>
<p>the exception I have mentioned. I took notes of some few sen-
</p>
<p>tences, which, in transcribing, I omitted.
</p>
<p>231
</p>
<p>Then your short-hand notes would shew some sentence taken
</p>
<p>down, and not transcribed ? Certainly.
</p>
<p>Is there any portion of that transcribed, supplied from your own
</p>
<p>memory ? No words are left out except connecting words which
</p>
<p>are generally left out by reporters. There is no substantial word in
</p>
<p>the sentences which I did not take down in short-hand ; and those
</p>
<p>sentences are complete with the exception of connecting particles.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Rafferty said : " Fellow-countrymen and brother Repealers,
</p>
<p>" the regenerator and liberator of our country has come to pay you a
</p>
<p>" visit. Allow me to tell you that the mighty leader of the Irish people
</p>
<p>" has come to address you ; this is the first time we had the honour to
</p>
<p>" see him at a public meeting in the town of Tullamore. I do not say
</p>
<p>" too much for the people of this locality when I assert that they were
</p>
<p>" at all times the ardent and sincere supporters of every measure
</p>
<p>" introduced by that great man for the benefit of his coun-
</p>
<p>" try. He has come to talk to you about repeal. I believe you all
</p>
<p>" know what that means ; he has come to bring our native parliament,
</p>
<p>" to establish a legislature in this country, that will make the laws for
</p>
<p>" the benefit of the people ; that will respect the rights of the peo-
</p>
<p>" pie, and that will give them good government. They have been
</p>
<p>" too long trampled on by the representatives of Saxon authority ;
</p>
<p>" too long have they been trodden down and treated worse than
</p>
<p>" slaves. That great and illustrious man will address you ; he will
</p>
<p>" tell you, as he has told others, the great and lasting blessings that a
</p>
<p>" domestic legislature will bring to this country. I return you thanks
</p>
<p>" for the honour you have done me; for thirty years I have laboured
</p>
<p>" sincerely for the public cause. I have been a supporter according
</p>
<p>" to my humble means of every measure introduced for the good of
</p>
<p>" the country, and my exertions shall not be wanting to forward the
</p>
<p>" great cause of repeal."
</p>
<p>Examination continued.  Did a Mr. Flanagan address the meet-
</p>
<p>ing? He did, very shortly.
</p>
<p>Did the Rev. Gentleman make a speech, and if he did, read
</p>
<p>it? The Witness said Mr. Flanagan addressed the meeting, so

</p>
<p>did the Rev. Mr. Spain and the Rev. Mr. Nolan. Mr. Flanagan
</p>
<p>made a short speech at that meeting. The Rev. Mr. Spain said :
</p>
<p>" On occasions of a nature similar to the present, it has lately
</p>
<p>" been often said, this is a ' great, day for Ireland,' but I may
</p>
<p>" be permitted to say, that this is a glorious day for the King's
</p>
<p>" County. This day the King's County has nobly done its duty,
</p>
<p>" and the truth of this assertion is fully borne out by the dis-
</p>
<p>" play which I now witness. But a few short days ago we had
</p>
<p>" a meeting at another end of this county, at Birr, at which the
</p>
<p>". Liberator did us the honour to attend ; it was one of those meet-
</p>
<p>" ing in which Ireland put forth her strength. The people assem-
</p>
<p>" bled in hundreds of thousands, determined that she should be a
</p>
<p>" nation. As I then had an opportunity of expressing my senti-
</p>
<p>" ments on the subject of Repeal, I shall now take leave to read the
</p>
<p>" resolution that had been put into my hands. [The Rev. Gentle-
</p>
<p>" man then read the first resolution]. Whatever be the view of
</p>
<p>" public men with regard to maintaining or repealing the Act of
</p>
<p>232
</p>
<p>" Union, no man of common sense or common honesty can deny
</p>
<p>u the truth of that resolution ; no man can deny the reckless cha-
</p>
<p>" racter of the men by whom the Union was proposed, or the
</p>
<p>" infamous means which were adopted to carry it ; and if it be
</p>
<p>" equally true that the distressful consequences too truly predicted
</p>
<p>" have been literally fulfilled, on what ground can any Irishman
</p>
<p>" wish to see it maintained? That Englishmen should be for the
</p>
<p>" Union, and even Englishmen of liberal principles should be for it,
</p>
<p>" is not surprising, but no Irishman ought to hesitate a moment
</p>
<p>" in demanding its immediate repeal." The Rev. Mr. Kearney ad-
</p>
<p>dressed the meeting. [The Witness read the speech, see ante, p. 92].
</p>
<p>The people, during those speeches shouted " Repeal, Repeal, Re-
</p>
<p>peal." Mr. S. Robinson spoke on that occasion. Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>spoke.
</p>
<p>The Attorney. General  I have no wish to inconvenience the
</p>
<p>traversers provided they are within the precincts of the Court;
</p>
<p>but I have just heard that two of the traversers left the Court for the
</p>
<p>purpose of attending a meeting. That is a thing that I cannot ac-
</p>
<p>quiesce in ; and, if it be the case, I require that they shall be sent
</p>
<p>for immediately.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore  They shall be sent for.
</p>
<p>[The Witness then resumed the reading of Mr. O'ConnelFs
</p>
<p>speech at Tullamore, see ante, p. 92].
</p>
<p>Examination resumed.  This meeting was held on a Sunday. I
</p>
<p>could not form an estimate of the numbers assembled. It was held in
</p>
<p>the Market Square. I saw many banners. There were inscriptions
</p>
<p>on some. Of those that were carried about I have no recollection ;
</p>
<p>but of those in the various parts of the town I have. One was: See
</p>
<p>the Conquering Hero comes. Another :
</p>
<p>" Breathes there a man with soul so dead,
</p>
<p>Who never to himself has said,
</p>
<p>This is my own  my native land."

<p>Mr. Rigby (one of the Jurors)  Was the banner Ireland, her
</p>
<p>Parliament, or the World in a Blaze, displayed in the town, or at
</p>
<p>the meeting ? It was in one of the streets ; but not at the meeting.
</p>
<p>There were a great many bands of music there. The meeting was
</p>
<p>over, I think, before five ; but I am not quite certain. It lasted
</p>
<p>about two hours.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mb. Hatchell.
</p>
<p>I was at Tullamore the evening before. I went before there
</p>
<p>was any crowd there. There was a platform erected for the speakers.
</p>
<p>I was on it. I saw one reporter there, and I understood there were
</p>
<p>others. There was no obstruction to my taking notes. The people
</p>
<p>assembled as if they were coming to a market or fair. There were
</p>
<p>females mixed through the men. I have no doubt there were chil-
</p>
<p>dren there. Every thing was peaceable, so far as the conduct of the
</p>
<p>233
</p>
<p>persons there was convened. I do not belong to that part of (lie
</p>
<p>country. I was employed to go there by Captain Despard, the
</p>
<p>resident magistrate for Meath. I was not there on the part of any
</p>
<p>newspaper at all.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell Were you there on the part of the Government ?
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice You cannot answer that question.
</p>
<p>I was not paid for my reporting, and I am very much afraid I shall
</p>
<p>not be paid. I transcribed my notes, but not for several days after
</p>
<p>the meeting. That was the reason I was not paid, because I did
</p>
<p>not make them out in time. I did not transcribe them until about
</p>
<p>six days after the meeting. I made my report out at home, at Trim.
</p>
<p>I knew that an application was made while I was from home. I went
</p>
<p>home after the meeting on Monday, and remained until Wednesday.
</p>
<p>My notes were on slips of paper not connected together. I under-
</p>
<p>stood that I was to be paid, but no price was fixed on. I had been
</p>
<p>in the habit of reporting for Drogheda papers for something more
</p>
<p>than a year, but I was not connected with any newspaper in the
</p>
<p>mean time. I was not very much out of practice, for I often took
</p>
<p>notes at the Assizes, though not employed. I did not transcribe
</p>
<p>them. I was absent from Trim for two days after the meeting. I
</p>
<p>was not written to for my report. I made it out because I knew I should
</p>
<p>be asked for it. The meeting was on the 16th of July. I think I
</p>
<p>had it transcribed in six days. Of course I was to be paid by the job.
</p>
<p>I never was paid by the line. I was paid by the year for newspaper
</p>
<p>work. I cannot say how long it took me to transcribe these notes.
</p>
<p>I did not transmit them when they were ready, and I did not intend
</p>
<p>to transmit them unless they were applied for. They were applied
</p>
<p>for during my absence from home. 1 was told, the day after I
</p>
<p>came home, that if the report was not sent that evening by post it
</p>
<p>would be too late. I had not got them ready, and I conceived then
</p>
<p>that it was too late. I thought it might possibly not be too late. I
</p>
<p>thought that the message might have been for the purpose of hurry-
</p>
<p>ing me, and therefore I transcribed them. I did not know, when I
</p>
<p>was going to take the notes, that they would be used. I had no idea

</p>
<p>I was to be examined as a witness. I did not think it probable that I
</p>
<p>should. But I thought that it was possible. 1 did not send them at
</p>
<p>all. I gave them to my bvother-in-law to read, and he gave them to
</p>
<p>a person ; I know not whether I am at liberty to mention his name.
</p>
<p>Mr. Tomb Certainly not.
</p>
<p>Cross-examination resumed.  Upon my oath I expected him tore-
</p>
<p>turn them to me. He did return them. He called a second time for
</p>
<p>the same person to show to another person. I cannot say how long a
</p>
<p>time intervened between the meeting and my finally parting with the
</p>
<p>notes. They were returned to me by him after I gave them the first
</p>
<p>time. I gave them a second time to my brother-in-law. They were
</p>
<p>not returned, and I never saw them till I saw them here in Dublin.
</p>
<p>1 do not know how long intervened between the meeting and the
</p>
<p>time when I parted with them first. I am sure it was more than a
</p>
<p>week. I first made a draft from my short-hand notes, and this was
</p>
<p>a fair copy of the draft. The draft was destroyed. The draft and
</p>
<p>2H
</p>
<p>234
</p>
<p>the notes were destroyed on the second day. The short-hand notes
</p>
<p>were also destroyed about two months after the meeting. I cannot
</p>
<p>fix particularly, but I should say it was not three months. I had
</p>
<p>them for a considerable time after the report had finally left my pos-
</p>
<p>session. I did not take down every sentence that was uttered. I
</p>
<p>often had to finish sentences where parts were wanting in my notes.
</p>
<p>Whole sentences may have been omitted in the report. I do not
</p>
<p>write Mr. Taylor's system of short-hand. I have this passage in my
</p>
<p>report : " that professors in Spain and France have proved that there
</p>
<p>is not such a people on the face of the earth." I swear that I took
</p>
<p>it down, in my notes. I am sure it was not a Scotch professor.
</p>
<p>I do not mean to say I am infallible ; I am sure that the words
</p>
<p>professor and philosopher are not alike in short-hand. [The Witness
</p>
<p>here wrote down the two words in short-hand]. I did not see the
</p>
<p>placard Ireland, her Parliament, or the World in a Blaze, carried to
</p>
<p>the market place. I saw it in the streets hours before the meeting.
</p>
<p>I did not walk in the streets after the meeting. I did not hear Mr.
</p>
<p>Steele desiring the banner to be taken down, nor did I hear of it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Robinson is a Quaker. He spoke as follows : " Gentlemen, when
</p>
<p>" Ireland asked bread, what did you get but a stone, and when you
</p>
<p>" asked for the amelioration of your sad condition you got an Arms'
</p>
<p>" Bill, a proof of their total ignorance of your wants and condition.
</p>
<p>" But, if the provisions of that bill were not of the most insulting and
</p>
<p>" unconstitutional nature, and jf it did not give the petty tyrant an
</p>
<p>" opportunity of trampling still further upon the liberties of the peo-
</p>
<p>" pie, I should care nothing about it, for we want no arms but our
</p>
<p>" own two arms, and our head to guide them, and whilst we move
</p>
<p>" under the counsel of the Liberator we shall be sure never to make
</p>
<p>" a bad use of them. We shall have recourse only to that moral war-
</p>
<p>" fare which tyrants never understood before ; a new species of war-
</p>
<p>" fare, a warfare more likely to restore the liberties of Ireland than
</p>
<p>" all the armies in Europe. We want amelioration, and are anxious
</p>
<p>" to do harm to no one, but to do good for ourselves. Instead of an
</p>
<p>" Arms' Bill they ought to give us another bill ; they ought to give

<p>" us fixity of tenure to better the condition of the poor landholders.
</p>
<p>" Our tenants ought to be paid for their improvements, and the land-
</p>
<p>" lords ought not to be allowed to drive or distress their tenants un-
</p>
<p>" less they gave leases for three lives or thirty-one years. I think
</p>
<p>" you like that ; that would be a good Arms' Bill ; that is the Arms'
</p>
<p>" Bill we want."
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell.  My Lords, we wish to have a copy of this report,
</p>
<p>or that it may be read so slowly, that our reporter may take it down.
</p>
<p>Mr. Tomb.  You are not entitled to any thing of the kind.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell.  No use could be made of it, except that the
</p>
<p>counsel may observe on different passages of it.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice. The Court cannot make any order
</p>
<p>on the subject.
</p>
<p>Cross-examination resumed  Aresolution was adopted, that a pe-
</p>
<p>tition to Parliament should be presented. I have no objection to my
</p>
<p>notes being read or made public. I do not know whose property
</p>
<p>235
</p>
<p>they are. The resolution for a petition was moved in the following
</p>
<p>words : " Gentlemen, I beg leave to move for the adoption of a pe-
</p>
<p>" tition to Parliament, for a repeal of that fatal measure, the
</p>
<p>" Union." That was seconded by Dr. Walsh. I should observe in
</p>
<p>explanation, that the names of few of the parties who spoke, were
</p>
<p>announced ; and it was only from making inquiries as to the names
</p>
<p>of the speakers, that I could get their names. The petition was
</p>
<p>read, but I did not take a note of it, because I thought the news-
</p>
<p>papers would give it. I did not apply for it. I read a copy of it in
</p>
<p>the newspaper. I saw it in more than one newspaper. I also ex-
</p>
<p>amined the report of the proceedings in two newspapers. I have no
</p>
<p>copy of the petition. The next note of a transaction in my notes is of
</p>
<p>a resolution. I do not know any thing of it. The Rev. Mr. Kearney
</p>
<p>moved it ; Mr. Clarke seconded it. There was another resolution
</p>
<p>moved by Mr. O'Loughlin, and seconded by Mr. Ryan, which I have
</p>
<p>not. The next is Mr. Robinson's speech. The next was the read-
</p>
<p>ing of the petition to Parliament. Mr. O'Connell's speech followed.
</p>
<p>I was taking notes at the table. I threw some of them into the fire,
</p>
<p>and my child cut some of them up. I threw the draft into the fire.
</p>
<p>He-examined by Mr. Tomb.
</p>
<p>I saw but one Reporter there. It was said he was for a newspaper.
</p>
<p>I understood there were more.
</p>
<p>John Simpson Stewart sworn, and examined by the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General.
</p>
<p>I am a Sub -inspector of the Constabulary. I was stationed at
</p>
<p>Tullamore in July last. 1 was there on the day of the meeting on
</p>
<p>the lGth July. I went round the town the morning of the meeting.
</p>
<p>I saw banners and mottoes. There were a large number of persons
</p>
<p>besides the inhabitants of the town in the streets. The people came
</p>
<p>in thousands to attend the meeting. This was between nine and ten.
</p>
<p>I know High-street, Tullamore.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General.  What were the mottoes you saw in
</p>
<p>High-street on that morning?
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn.  I object to that question. I submit that placards

</p>
<p>seen in the streets of Tullamore cannot be evidence.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice Why not ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn.  Because it does not appear when, or by whom they
</p>
<p>were put up. They were seen before the meeting took place.
</p>
<p>They may have been put up in the night, when scarcely any one
</p>
<p>was in the town. The numbers who came in could not make it
</p>
<p>evidence.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice  I do not think that it is necessary
</p>
<p>to show by whom it was done, as the evidence now stands. Observe,
</p>
<p>that all the parts and particulars of what took place that day, cannot
</p>
<p>be given in evidence at the same time. What the Witness has sworn
</p>
<p>to, amounts to this ;  he was in the town of Tullamore on the day
</p>
<p>of the meeting, attending to his duty as an officer of police. In the
</p>
<p>morning vast numbers of people came into the town, and he, in the
</p>
<p>236
</p>
<p>exercise of his duty, went round the town to make his observations.
</p>
<p>He saw that the multitude did not belong to the town. He walked
</p>
<p>about to see what was taking place, and he observed sundry banners
</p>
<p>and mottoes. He states this as a matter of fact, which he saw in
</p>
<p>the course of the morning, while preparations for the meeting were
</p>
<p>going on.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  He has not said where he saw those banners. I
</p>
<p>objected to his stating the inscriptions before laying foundation, by
</p>
<p>proving where the banners or placard were placed. A banner or
</p>
<p>a placard posted in High-street is not evidence.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  It would not be evidence if it had
</p>
<p>not been proved that there was an assemblage of people.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General cited Redford v. Birley, and Rex v.
</p>
<p>Hunt.
</p>
<p>The Court overruled the objection.
</p>
<p>Examination resumed There were large numbers of persons in
</p>
<p>the town. They went through High-street. Large numbers came
</p>
<p>from Birr. There was an arch in High-street, stretching across the
</p>
<p>whole street.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General.  Was there a motto on it ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn It does not appear when or by whom it was erected.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General.  The case of Rexw Hunt, 3 Barn. & Aid.
</p>
<p>578, proves that this is evidence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitsgibbon.  There was only a verdict on the fourth count
</p>
<p>in that case. That was for attending an unlawful assembly. No
</p>
<p>one knows who erected this arch, what evidence is it that Daniel
</p>
<p>O'Connell is guilty of conspiracy ? In Rex v. Hunt, there was only
</p>
<p>a verdict on the count for attending an unlawful assembly, and it was
</p>
<p>given in support of that count. There is no such count in this in-
</p>
<p>dictment.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General  In Rex v. Hunt, there was a conviction
</p>
<p>on the fourth count. Chief Justice Abbott in his judgment in that case
</p>
<p>savs : " Inscriptions used on such occasions are the public expression of
</p>
<p>" the sentiments of those who bear and adopt them, and have rather

</p>
<p>" the character of speeches than of writings." Accordingly the evi-
</p>
<p>dence of inscriptions on those banners was admitted. The present
</p>
<p>case varies in no respect from that, except that this is an indictment
</p>
<p>for a conspiracy for doing that which was done in Rex v. Hunt. The
</p>
<p>character of an assembly must be shown by the banners. That is what
</p>
<p>I am proceeding to show. The special pleas in Redford v. Birley,
</p>
<p>exactly apply to this case. On these authorities I am entitled to show
</p>
<p>the preparations for this meeting, and every thing that took place at
</p>
<p>it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside There is a manifest distinction between this case
</p>
<p>and that of Rex v. Hunt. It does not appear that this arch was
</p>
<p>erected or these banners carried by any persons connected with the
</p>
<p>meeting. The Chief Justice, in that case, says, that the inscrip-
</p>
<p>tions are a public expression of those who bear and adopt them.
</p>
<p>This inscription was never adopted by any of the traversers. It
</p>
<p>might as well be said, that, if arches were erected at Clontarf and
</p>
<p>237
</p>
<p>the meeting was at Donnybrook, the inscriptions could be given in
</p>
<p>evidence to show the intention of the persons assembled.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice I think these flags, mottoes, and banners
</p>
<p>are admissible in evidence, for the purpose of showing the real cha-
</p>
<p>racter of the meeting. Suppose the parties chose to call their meet-
</p>
<p>ing a peaceable meeting, but that, in point of fact, it was of a hostile
</p>
<p>character, which would be evidenced by the banners, could it be
</p>
<p>contended that they were inadmissible to show the real character
</p>
<p>of the meeting? I am of opinion that the objection should be
</p>
<p>overruled.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin Evidence of acts and declarations is ad-
</p>
<p>missible to show the object of an assembly. Here is an arch erected
</p>
<p>in a public street, leading to the place of meeting, in the same town,
</p>
<p>not so remote as Clontarf is from Donnybrook ; and if it was per-
</p>
<p>mitted to continue there during the holding of the assembly, it would
</p>
<p>be admissible to show the intention of those holding that assembly,
</p>
<p>and must be considered as an expression of opinion. This case
</p>
<p>is not exactly the same as those cited, but the principle exactly
</p>
<p>applies.
</p>
<p>Examination resumed.  On one side of the arch was written :
</p>
<p>The Slave-master may brandish his Whip, but we are determined to be
</p>
<p>free. On the other : Beware of physical Force. Beware! Phy-
</p>
<p>sical Force is a dangerous Experiment to try on Irishmen. Repeal
</p>
<p>shall not be put down by the Bayonet. The Roman Catholic chapel at
</p>
<p>Tullamore is opposite the Corn Market. The platform could be seen
</p>
<p>from the chapel gate. There was an arch opposite the chapel gate,
</p>
<p>with the inscription, Ireland, her Parliament ; or the World in a
</p>
<p>Blaze. The meeting was held on Sunday. The greater number of the
</p>
<p>persons entered under that arch. The platform was exactly opposite
</p>
<p>to it. There was a banner opposite the platform, with the inscription :
</p>
<p>Ireland must not be, ought not to be, shall not be, a Serf Nation.
</p>
<p>There was a motto on the platform: Nine Millions of People are too
</p>
<p>great to be dragged at the Tail of any Nation. There were other in-
</p>
<p>scriptions, He who commits a Crime gives Strength to the Enemy. God

</p>
<p>save the Queen. There were others : See the Conquering Hero
</p>
<p>comes. Cead mille failtha. Peace and Perseverance. Repeal.
</p>
<p>Justice and Prosperity to all Classes and Creeds. Breathes there
</p>
<p>a Man, c. Ireland ivelcomes her Liberator. The crowds began to
</p>
<p>come in early, but the greater number from half-past nine to one
</p>
<p>o'clock. The greater number came by the Birr road. A great num-
</p>
<p>ber of bands came into the town. About nine or ten bands. I sup-
</p>
<p>pose they were temperance bands. They came in at different times,
</p>
<p>with large numbers of people. They came in in sections of four.
</p>
<p>To Mr. Justice Perrin I mean four abreast.
</p>
<p>One of them got out of his place to stop at a particular house, and a
</p>
<p>horseman said to him, " d you, Sir, keep your ranks;" he obeyed
</p>
<p>and returned to his proper place. I counted between seventy and eighty
</p>
<p>sections of four. I could not be particular to the number, but I think
</p>
<p>there were about three hundred. The footmen did not come in with
</p>
<p>the same regularity. I observed persons giving directions to the
</p>
<p>238
</p>
<p>crowd generally, halting them and getting them into order. Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell arrived the night before the meeting. I think the arch
</p>
<p>in High-street was erected the night before. I saw the one oppo-
</p>
<p>site the chapel. It was erected in the morning after ten o'clock. I
</p>
<p>saw the mottoes over the arches between half-past nine and ten
</p>
<p>o'clock. Mr. O'Connell came to the platform about two o'clock. I
</p>
<p>saw Mr. Steele also at the meeting. I have no doubt Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell was there. I heard some parts of Mr. O'Connell's speech. I
</p>
<p>was in a store overlooking the platform, ten or twelve yards from it.
</p>
<p>I heard him say " that he came there from the centre of Ireland to
</p>
<p>" announce to them the certainty of Repeal. He would prove from
</p>
<p>" Peel and Wellington that Repeal was certain," or words to that
</p>
<p>effect. He likened Peel to a fool who came to a river and stood
</p>
<p>there to let the waters flow past. He made some allusions to Lord
</p>
<p>Beaumont, and called him "despicable Beaumont." As far as I heard
</p>
<p>it, he alluded to a speech of Peel's, who said he would prefer a civil
</p>
<p>war before he would grant Repeal, and he then said, " the better
</p>
<p>" day the better deed ; let him make war on Ireland, for he stood
</p>
<p>" there to hurl his high and haughty defiance at him." I am not
</p>
<p>giving his exact words, but I took this down, as nearly and accurately
</p>
<p>as I could. He said, the people of Ireland should not be compelled
</p>
<p>to pay for the Church to which they do not belong. He alluded to
</p>
<p>the Government or somebody giving him the ecclesiastical establish-
</p>
<p>ment, and he said he would take it as an instalment. He did not
</p>
<p>say how much he would take, but he said: "I will take what I get,
</p>
<p>and I will make them then give me the remainder." He then
</p>
<p>asked whether there were any teetotallers there, and a great num-
</p>
<p>ber of people put up their hands. He then said, " If I want you, can-
</p>
<p>" not I get you any day in the week ; but I will take care I will
</p>
<p>" never want you." He then told them not to vote for a Tory or
</p>
<p>anti- Repealer. I calculated there were from sixty to seventy thou-
</p>
<p>sand men, women, and children there. I do not include the residents
</p>
<p>of Tullamore ; all the persons left Tullamore that night. The
</p>
<p>meeting dispersed at about five o'clock. Some of the bands were

<p>in white, some in green and white.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Henn.
</p>
<p>I am not a short-hand writer. I was quartered at Tullamore
</p>
<p>two years before this. I was apprised of the meeting. It was my
</p>
<p>duty to attend and report what occurred, and I did so. I heard
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell say something about Ribbonism, but at that particular
</p>
<p>time I lost the whole thread of his discourse. There were agreat number
</p>
<p>of men, women, and children in the town. All went off as peaceably
</p>
<p>as it was possible. Thete was not the slightest occasion for the inter-
</p>
<p>ference of the police, nor slightest tendency to riot or disturbance.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn Do you not think there was less probability of
</p>
<p>accidents from the crowd observing such order in coming in? I do
</p>
<p>not think the order was observed to prevent accidents.
</p>
<p>Have you attended other meetings? I have been at some
</p>
<p>meetings at fairs and markets.
</p>
<p>239
</p>
<p>Have you seen persons going in this order at funerals? I never
</p>
<p>have. I went about the town the night before the meeting. I am
</p>
<p>almost positive I saw the arch in High-street the night before, but
</p>
<p>I am not quite positive I did. I am quite positive I saw the motto,
</p>
<p>Ireland, her Parliament, or the JVorld in a Blaze. I saw it on the
</p>
<p>Sunday morning, the 17th of July, at about ten o'clock.
</p>
<p>You did not interfere to take it down ? No.
</p>
<p>Will you swear it was not taken down that day ? No.
</p>
<p>Will you swear it was not taken down before the meeting ? I
</p>
<p>will not.
</p>
<p>Was it close to the platform ? I was at an angle so that I could
</p>
<p>not see it.
</p>
<p>Was it there when you went home ? I went home a different
</p>
<p>way.
</p>
<p>Did you see any one putting it up ? I did.
</p>
<p>Where were you when Mr. O'Connell went on the platform ? In
</p>
<p>the store overlooking it ; the arch was not opposite to that.
</p>
<p>Will you say it was there at twelve o'clock? I cannot say.
</p>
<p>Will you swearit was there at the commencement of the meeting?
</p>
<p>I did not see it.
</p>
<p>When did you see it last ? When I went to take a note of the
</p>
<p>different mottoes.
</p>
<p>Can you swear you saw that motto at twelve o'clock ? I think I
</p>
<p>saw it about eleven o'clock.
</p>
<p>The meeting was at two ? Yes.
</p>
<p>You took down one motto, Patience and Perseverance ? I did.
</p>
<p>Did you observe these words, and Obedience to the Laics, on
</p>
<p>the same banner ? No.
</p>
<p>Did you see Repeal, but no Separation ? I did not ; it is not
</p>
<p>on my notes, and I would have taken it down if it had been there.
</p>
<p>Were there not a number of ladies and gentlemen there ? I saw
</p>
<p>a number of women and children, but very few ladies.
</p>
<p>Did you see the people coming from church ? I did not.
</p>
<p>Did you see on a placard, The Queen, God bless her ? I saw

</p>
<p>God save the Queen. I do not recollect seeing The Queen, God
</p>
<p>bless her. There were several minor mottoes and inscriptions in win-
</p>
<p>dows which I did not take down. I took down every one that was across
</p>
<p>the street and on the platform. I took down all the principal ones.
</p>
<p>I did not take down all those which were publicly exposed. I think
</p>
<p>I may swear I took down all those on the platform ; but I am not po-
</p>
<p>sitive. I have no recollection of seeing on a placard, The Rose,
</p>
<p>Shamrock, and Thistle. I took down my notes at the meeting. I
</p>
<p>wrote my report on the next day at three o'clock. I received my
</p>
<p>directions on Saturday and Sunday. I sent it the next day.
</p>
<p>Neale Browne sivorn, and examined by Mr. Napier.
</p>
<p>lama resident magistrate at Tullamore. I was there on the
</p>
<p>16th of July. I know where the church is. My house is on the
</p>
<p>High-street. I saw the people coming into town from the western
</p>
<p>side, from Frankford, at about one. Persons had come into the town
</p>
<p>240
</p>
<p>before that. I saw several bands of music in the town. That was
</p>
<p>at the time of divine service in the church. I remained from church
</p>
<p>to be ready, if called upon as a magistrate. When the procession
</p>
<p>was formed, it passed near the church. This was at half-past two,
</p>
<p>or nearly so. I saw Mr. O'Connell. I think Mr, Steele was sitting
</p>
<p>in the carriage, but I am not positive. I was in a field in the rere of
</p>
<p>my house when I heard the music, and I then went into the house ;
</p>
<p>and when I got near the window the procession had passed by. I
</p>
<p>followed it into the street, I do not recollect whether there were
</p>
<p>any horsemen. The people were walking about fifteen a-breast, with
</p>
<p>regularity and order. After taking different turns through the
</p>
<p>streets, the procession went to the Market square, and passed within
</p>
<p>about one hundred and fifty or two hundred yards from the base of
</p>
<p>the mound where the church is built. I did not know the tunes. I
</p>
<p>met several people coming from church through my own fields. That
</p>
<p>is not the usual way for them to return. The greatest number of
</p>
<p>persons who lived at the top of the town, about thirty-five, went
</p>
<p>through my fields. The road they usually went, was that down
</p>
<p>which the procession passed. Three bands had military uniform,
</p>
<p>with the exception that they had no belts. The Roscrea band
</p>
<p>wore scarlet hats, as are worn by the cavalry. Another band
</p>
<p>had military caps. When the people came from the western side
</p>
<p>about two o'clock, about 240 horsemen came with them in a column,
</p>
<p>of about five a-breast. The general appearance was, that they kept
</p>
<p>order. In some instance they mixed with the crowd.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Moore.
</p>
<p>I have been at Tullamore since the 26th or 27th of September,
</p>
<p>1835. The bands were all temperance bands. I have heard of
</p>
<p>temperance bands having uniforms within the last two years, long
</p>
<p>antecedent to the 16th of July. I did not know what tunes they
</p>
<p>played. I know the last witness, Mr. Stuart. I sent directions to
</p>
<p>him and to the County Inspector, directing that they should attend the
</p>
<p>meeting. That was on the 15th of July. I had received directions
</p>
<p>on the subject, on my report that

<p>From whom did you receive them? [The question was objected
</p>
<p>to, and overruled/]
</p>
<p>Examination resumed  It was on my suggestion that the di-
</p>
<p>rections were given. I did not go down to the place of meeting.
</p>
<p>There was no riot or disturbance at the meeting. No report was
</p>
<p>made to me of any. There can be do doubt there was none.
</p>
<p>Re-examined by Mr. Napier.
</p>
<p>Roscommon is thirty Irish miles from Tullamore.
</p>
<p>James Johnston sworn, and examined by Sergeant Warren.
</p>
<p>I am Head Constable of the Sligo Constabulary. I was at Longford
</p>
<p>on the 2nd of May, last. There was a large Repeal meeting there on
</p>
<p>that day. It would be impossible to form an accurate estimate of the
</p>
<p>numbers, but I should say there were 40,000 or 50,000 persons there.
</p>
<p>241
</p>
<p>There was an array of horsemen opposite the platform. They were
</p>
<p>about 100 in number. The people were in many instances accom-
</p>
<p>panied by bands. 1 observed two bands in semi-uniform. I observed
</p>
<p>mottoes on banners. I saw Cead rnille failtha, on a large piece of
</p>
<p>calico. Ireland fur the Irish and the Irish for Ireland. Every
</p>
<p>Man ivho commits a Crime gives Strength to the Enemy. Breathes
</p>
<p>there a Man with Soul so dead, Sfc. Welcome Erin's brightest Star.
</p>
<p>Repeal and no Separation. A Population of Nine Millions is
</p>
<p>too great to be dragged at the Tail of any Nation. I was fifteen
</p>
<p>yards at the rere of the platform. I heard almost all the speakers
</p>
<p>with distinctness ; at times I saw them. Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Steele,
</p>
<p>and several persons whom I did not know. The Chairman, a gentle-
</p>
<p>man called Count Nugent, said: " The Irish will get all they want
</p>
<p>" if they attend to their friends. Ireland will be able to right herself.
</p>
<p>" It is the duty of every Irishman to rally round the standard of Re-
</p>
<p>" peal." Priest O'Beime spoke next, he said : " This is not a time
</p>
<p>" to give a silent vote. Every Irishman should rally round the stan-
</p>
<p>" dard of Repeal. The loyalty of Ireland is not the loyalty of expe-
</p>
<p>" diency. Ireland will again be raised to the dignity of a nation,
</p>
<p>" and will cease to be legislated for by those who are ignorant of her
</p>
<p>"condition, and hostile to her prosperity." He then inquired:
</p>
<p>" Have you a voice in the Legislature?" There were several cries of
</p>
<p>" No, no." At the termination of his speech, he called for three
</p>
<p>cheers for the Queen, and three hearty cheers for the Repeal of the
</p>
<p>Union. Mr. Carberry said : " They ought to join to crush England,
</p>
<p>" and the year will close with a Parliament in College-green. The
</p>
<p>" Liberator's promise will be faithfully fulfilled  we will have a Legis-
</p>
<p>" lature for ourselves, which will make the people happy and con-
</p>
<p>" tented." I do not know the name of the next speaker, but he
</p>
<p>said : " O'Connell might be offered the highest office in the Govern-
</p>
<p>" ment, but he does not deserve your esteem if he deserts the cause
</p>
<p>" of Repeal." The Rev. Mr. Gavin spoke next. Dr. Higgins spoke
</p>
<p>next ; but I have no note of his speech. Mr. O'Connell said : " I
</p>
<p>" can tell you our's is no vain cause. Let there be no Ribbon so-

<p>" ciety in the county. Take no illegal oath. We are peaceable.
</p>
<p>" Let them but attack us, and then " He made a pause, and
</p>
<p>continued : " We will stand to our defence. Let Peel and Welling-
</p>
<p>" ton give us an Act. of Parliament ; we will find a way to drive a
</p>
<p>" coach and six through it."
</p>
<p>Sergeant Warren.  Was the speech spoken throughout with
</p>
<p>the same tone of voice ? Yes, except the pause. It was made in
</p>
<p>away that I cannot describe, but the people seemed to understand it.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell continued : " I will tell you what they will do. They
</p>
<p>" will take the commission of the peace from your supporters. But
</p>
<p>" an Irish parliament will some of these days enable me to punish
</p>
<p>" them in an exemplary manner." He said that the temporalities of
</p>
<p>the Church ought not to be allocated to the Church of the minority.
</p>
<p>" It is preposterous for one man to ask another to pay for his educa-
</p>
<p>u tion. 1 will tell you what Repeal will do for you ; you will get
</p>
<p>2i
</p>
<p>242
</p>
<p>" fixity of tenure. I will explain to you what that is. It will pre-
</p>
<p>" vent you from having a landlord, who will not give you a twenty-
</p>
<p>" one years' lease ; [a voice from the crowd, 'hurrah !'] I would give
</p>
<p>" the landlord his right, but I would make him perform his duty. I will
</p>
<p>" tell you what the Union has done for us. It has carried away nine
</p>
<p>" millions from the country, which might otherwise have been spent in
</p>
<p>" it. We will not continue under the domination of the Saxons and
</p>
<p>" oppressors who have ground us to dust, but " He made a pause,
</p>
<p>and continued : " We were never conquered. Ireland must be for
</p>
<p>" the Irish. You are too good not to have the majesty of a nation.
</p>
<p>" Go home now quietly and tell your friends of this day's news, and
</p>
<p>" when I want you again, I will let you know the day." Mr. Steele
</p>
<p>announced to the multitude, that he had several hundred of copies
</p>
<p>of an address by the Liberator to the people, in relation to some
</p>
<p>measure of Sir Robert Peel's, for distribution. I did not see him
</p>
<p>distribute any.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fitzgibbon.
</p>
<p>I never saw Priest O'Beirne before that day. I do not know
</p>
<p>him. I was standing about fifteen yards in the rear of the platform.
</p>
<p>I had a difficulty in taking clown what was said, for the backs of the
</p>
<p>speakers were turned towards me. I wrote these papers the same
</p>
<p>day. I had a window-stool in a house to write on. I was sent to
</p>
<p>Longford on duty ; another head-constable, Maguire, was with me.
</p>
<p>We were to observe the meeting, and to take notes of what we
</p>
<p>considered material. Mr. O'Connell made a significant pause, in-
</p>
<p>tended to convey something not expressed. I was behind him when
</p>
<p>he made the pause.
</p>
<p>Will you turn your back to the jury, and show what sort of a
</p>
<p>pause Mr. O'Connell made? I do not think I could give it the
</p>
<p>same expression that Mr. O'Connell did. I cannot recollect whether
</p>
<p>I saw his face when he was making the pause. The pause may have
</p>
<p>been three, or four, or five seconds, it was not a minute. He made
</p>
<p>another pause of that kind.
</p>
<p>What was Mr. O'Connell saying when he made the pause ? He

</p>
<p>said, "will you submit to be ground to the dust, but " and he made
</p>
<p>the pause. " We were never conquered." That is the best imitation
</p>
<p>I can give of the pause.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  I fear we are putting you in a false position
</p>
<p>in asking you to imitate Mr. O'Connell.
</p>
<p>I arrived in Longford on the night of the 27th. There were
</p>
<p>no riots there. I saw no breach of the peace, nor a tendency to it,
</p>
<p>but the people came in in a most disorderly manner, leaping, and
</p>
<p>shouting, and brandishing their sticks. As they were coming in
</p>
<p>the people were in a sweating rage of excitement. Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>had not addressed them. They were led in in that state by persons
</p>
<p>whom I believe to be priests.
</p>
<p>Did you see any of the priests with sticks? They may have had
</p>
<p>them ; my recollection does not enable me to state that they had.
</p>
<p>Are you able to swear whether they had or not ? I saw several
</p>
<p>243
</p>
<p>men on horseback who were dressed as priests, but I cannot say
</p>
<p>whether they had sticks; they may have had them.
</p>
<p>Did you know them to be priests? Except from the style of
</p>
<p>their dress, I did not know them to be priests.
</p>
<p>Did you see any man give offence to another that day ? I be-
</p>
<p>lieve I did not. I saw persons pulling others down from the plat-
</p>
<p>form. A momentary anger may have arisen.
</p>
<p>Did you see it ? I will not swear that I did.
</p>
<p>Did you not tell me a moment ago that you did ? I might have
</p>
<p>seen it, but I will not swear that I did.
</p>
<p>Was there even momentary anger ? There might have been
</p>
<p>without my noticing if.
</p>
<p>Did you see any ? I will not swear that I did. I saw no breach
</p>
<p>of the peace. The people appeared of one temper, with regard to
</p>
<p>the advice of Mr. O'Connell, and obedient to him.
</p>
<p>At what hour did you see the leaping and brandishing of sticks ?
</p>
<p>The people came in from ten o'clock until two.
</p>
<p>Did all the bodies shout and brandish their sticks ? They did not.
</p>
<p>Where were the police ? I should say they dare not show their
</p>
<p>faces. I was in plain clothes. Two of us came from Sligo. There
</p>
<p>may have been shouting at several parts of the town, about the
</p>
<p>centre of the street. I was in Needham's house. He is a person in
</p>
<p>business. I believe he is a chandler. I cannot say in what street he
</p>
<p>lives. I observed the shouting and whirling of sticks several times.
</p>
<p>From ten until two, occasionally, there was such a display of the mob
</p>
<p>as they entered. Those displays took place often. There were no
</p>
<p>policemen in the street of Longford from about eight till ten. I
</p>
<p>may have seen policemen in the evening. It was loud shouting.
</p>
<p>Every person there should have heard it, if he had the use of his
</p>
<p>ears.
</p>
<p>Re-examined by Sergeant Warren.
</p>
<p>I do not know whether the police were in their barracks or about
</p>
<p>the town.
</p>
<p>You have been asked about Mr. O'Connell's pause ; did you ever

</p>
<p>paws of.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon.  It was observed the other day by the Solicitor
</p>
<p>General, that a certain observation had been made by one of Her
</p>
<p>Majesty's Counsel; now, that is an observation made by one of Her
</p>
<p>Majesty's Sergeants, arising out of my cross-examination.
</p>
<p>TUESDAY, January 23rd.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Burton was still absent from indisposition.
</p>
<p>John Maguire sworn, and examined by Mr. Bennett.
</p>
<p>I am Head Constable of Police. I was stationed in Sligo in May
</p>
<p>last. I was at Longford on the 2nd of May. It was on Monday. I
</p>
<p>244
</p>
<p>saw the people coming in between nine and ten o'clock. There were
</p>
<p>bands of music parading the streets. They had military caps with
</p>
<p>red tassels and gold bands. Another band was preceded by a drum-
</p>
<p>major with a large stick. The people followed the bands. I calcu-
</p>
<p>lated there were between forty and fifty thousand assembled. Different
</p>
<p>parties came in in military order, led on by a person whom I believe
</p>
<p>to be a Roman Catholic priest. They came in a kind of rank and
</p>
<p>file. There were several on horseback. They came in with Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell. He was accompanied by about one hundred horsemen.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell came in on the front box of a carriage. It was a close
</p>
<p>carriage. There was another gentleman sitting with him on the box,
</p>
<p>who I understood to be Bishop Higgins. Mr. Steele was in the car-
</p>
<p>riage. Another person was in the carriage, who appeared to be a
</p>
<p>clerical gentleman. Mr. O'Connell arrived about two o'clock, pre-
</p>
<p>ceded by three or four bands. The houses in the town were
</p>
<p>decorated with green boughs, and some of the parties had boughs.
</p>
<p>Some of them had sticks, and brandished them when they came near the
</p>
<p>platform. The meeting terminated between three and four o'clock.
</p>
<p>I was near the platform, it was very large, and there were numbers
</p>
<p>of people on it. I saw none of the traversers except Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>and Mr. Steele. I took notes of the mottoes and banners. I al-
</p>
<p>lowed the other constable, Johnson, to take notes of the proceed-
</p>
<p>ings. The motto over the platform was Ireland for the Irish and
</p>
<p>the Irish fur Ireland. That was very conspicuous. In another
</p>
<p>part of the town : A Population of Nine Millions is too great to he
</p>
<p>dragged at the Tail of any Nation. This was fastened to the wall on
</p>
<p>white calico on the Dublin road. I saw it there after Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>passed. " He that commits a Crime gives Strength to the Enemy,
</p>
<p>was another motto. I am sure the word "enemy" was there.
</p>
<p>Repeal and no Separation, was another. Cead mille failtha was
</p>
<p>another. I heard Mr. O'Connell speak. He said, " Their's was no
</p>
<p>vain cause." I do not recollect, having heard any allusion made by
</p>
<p>him to trials by jury, or the administration of justice in the country.
</p>
<p>He said, " They will take the commission of the peace from your re-

</p>
<p>spected supporters." I recollect the last sentence in the speech
</p>
<p>perfectly  to go home quietly, to tell their friends what they saw
</p>
<p>there, and that when he wanted them again they would come. Mr.
</p>
<p>Steele then came forward. I saw people brandishing sticks as they
</p>
<p>came in. After Mr. O'Connell made his speech I saw the brandish-
</p>
<p>ing of sticks. After the meeting was over they all dispersed. I do
</p>
<p>not know where the bands came from.

<p>To the Lord Chief Justice.  I suppose there were 40,000 or
</p>
<p>50,000, but it is impossible to form an accurate estimate.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hatchell.
</p>
<p>I am in the constabulary, and a first Head Constable ; I am not a
</p>
<p>Sub-Inspector, but it is the next step to my olfice. Johnston was the
</p>
<p>Head Constable there on the occasion. There are two degrees in the
</p>
<p>class of Head Constables. There is one Chief Head Constable in each
</p>
<p>county.
</p>
<p>245
</p>
<p>I am a first Head Constable, and the next" step is Sub-Inspector. I
</p>
<p>came to Longford on the 27th of May, the night before the meeting.
</p>
<p>I came with Johnston, who was examined here yesterday.
</p>
<p>Did you read any report of his evidence in the papers this morn-
</p>
<p>ing ? Not this morning.
</p>
<p>Did you last night, Sir ? Yes, I did.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell  So I thought.
</p>
<p>Were you ever in the army ? No.
</p>
<p>Where did you stop in Longford? We got into a house conve-
</p>
<p>nient to the platform.
</p>
<p>And you saw it of course ? Yes, certainly.
</p>
<p>Did you see any breach of the peace committed? None what-
</p>
<p>ever.
</p>
<p>Or any tendency to a breach of the peace ? There was no breach
</p>
<p>of the peace committed
</p>
<p>Why do you evade giving me a direct answer ? I will tell you
</p>
<p>all I know about the subject.
</p>
<p>Was there any tendency to a breach of the peace? I did not see
</p>
<p>any breach of the peace committed.
</p>
<p>Give me a direct answer, Sir. Was there any tendency to a
</p>
<p>breach of the peace ? None that I saw.
</p>
<p>I take it for granted you are not a Repealer? No, nor do I be-
</p>
<p>long to any other party.
</p>
<p>Do you not belong to a. party of police? Yes.
</p>
<p>You saw a great deal of people there ? Yes, after Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>arrived.
</p>
<p>But there was no breach of the peace, and having gone there to
</p>
<p>preserve the peace, and finding the peace was not broken,
</p>
<p>" Othello's occupation 's gone."
</p>
<p>And Mr. Head Constable Maguire had nothing at all to do ; is not
</p>
<p>that so ? I did not go there to preserve the peace at all.
</p>
<p>Did you not, though ? Ah me ! Well, and what brought vou
</p>
<p>there Mr. Head Constable Maguire ? I went there to make observa-
</p>
<p>tions.

</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell  Hah ! that was the taclic of a good general, to see
</p>
<p>how the land lay in the first instance. When we are assembled for
</p>
<p>preserving the peace we act under the command of the Sub-Inspector.
</p>
<p>The people were coming in merrily ? Yes, they were.
</p>
<p>The same as to a country fair? Eh ?
</p>
<p>Did you ever see the people coming into an Irish country fair
</p>
<p>merrily ? Yes, very often.
</p>
<p>Kicking up their heels and dancing a little bit? Yes, something
</p>
<p>after that fashion.
</p>
<p>You said the people were brandishing their sticks? Yes, they
</p>
<p>were.
</p>
<p>Was it in anger or disorder, or had it a tendency to anger or
</p>
<p>quarrel amongst themselves ? Not the least anger.
</p>
<p>They were coming in in parties you said ? Yes, they were coming
</p>
<p>in military array.
</p>
<p>246
</p>
<p>Oh, dear me, in military array. Now, had they their sticks on
</p>
<p>their shoulders this way ? [Here the learned gentleman shouldered
</p>
<p>a large pen amid great laughter]. Was that the way, eh ? No, they
</p>
<p>had not.
</p>
<p>Do you understand me ? I suppose I do.
</p>
<p>Did they carry arms ? No.
</p>
<p>Did they come to the post ? No.
</p>
<p>Did they present arms when the general came up ? No.
</p>
<p>Did they charge ? No.
</p>
<p>They did not ? No.
</p>
<p>And yet they came in military array. Wonderful Captain Ma-
</p>
<p>guire. They came in military array and did not carry arms, did not
</p>
<p>come to the post, did not present arms to the general, did not charge,
</p>
<p>and yet they came in military array ? Yes, they did.
</p>
<p>Did they halt ? Some of them might have halted.
</p>
<p>Do'you mean that some of them were lame ? There might be
</p>
<p>some of them lame, and in that sense they might halt.
</p>
<p>Where di I they halt ? Near the platform.
</p>
<p>That was when they could go no further ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Did they *tand at ease ? I suppose they did, for some of them
</p>
<p>must have come a good distance, and therefore they must have been
</p>
<p>tired.
</p>
<p>Oh ! they wanted rest, and then they stood at ease. Just so.
</p>
<p>They marched and halted, and stood at ease, because they were
</p>
<p>tired ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Do you know any thing about marching? Yes, something.
</p>
<p>Were you ever drilled ? I was.
</p>
<p>Do you know the first movement ? When a person is desired
</p>
<p>to march, he is to put his left leg foremost.
</p>
<p>And let your right leg follow it? Yes, that is it.
</p>
<p>Well, now, were the people coming in military array, with their
</p>
<p>left legs foremost ? I do not know which of their legs were fore-
</p>
<p>most.
</p>
<p>Did you see them all march ? I do not know.

</p>
<p>Did you ever hear " Come, brave boys, we're on for marching?"
</p>
<p>Can you explain the difference between the right and left legs ? Not
</p>
<p>exactly.
</p>
<p>Which of your legs is foremost now ? I cannot say.
</p>
<p>Wr.HatcheU.  Come, Captain Maguire  General, I think, I ought
</p>
<p>to call you, did you ever read Dundas on Manoeuvring? Yes, a
</p>
<p>little.
</p>
<p>What part of it ? I cannot say.
</p>
<p>Then, you have forgotten your lesson ? So it appears.
</p>
<p>Well, now, having gotten so far with your left leg foremost ;
</p>
<p>what do you mean by rank and file ? Two deep.
</p>
<p>Ah, hah! you are too deep for me. On your oath, does it mean
</p>
<p>two deep, or a single file ? Cannot tell exactly.
</p>
<p>Oh, there you are, Mr. Captain Maguire, on Dundas tactics.
</p>
<p>Do you mean to tell that Jury that the people all came in, marching
</p>
<p>two deep ? I do not.
</p>
<p>247
</p>
<p>They did not march two and two, rank and file ? They did not
</p>
<p>all march two deep, but some of them did.
</p>
<p>How many of them did so ? Some more and some less ?
</p>
<p>Were they short or long? I do not know.
</p>
<p>Well, take the largest party and say how many came two deep ?
</p>
<p>Mr. HatchelLW e\\ ?
</p>
<p>Witness W T ell, Sir.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchetl.  I say ill, Sir; go on.
</p>
<p>Well, go on ? The largest number of a party might exceed one
</p>
<p>hundred.
</p>
<p>Did they come in two deep ? Some of them did.
</p>
<p>Will you swear that any one body of them came two deep ?
</p>
<p>Some of them came two deep, in a hind of military order.
</p>
<p>Oh ! a kind of military order, was it ? Yes.
</p>
<p>By virtue of your oath, Sir, did you not swear a moment ago
</p>
<p>that they came in rank and file ? It was a kind of rank and file.
</p>
<p>Like mounting the castle guard? Exactly so.
</p>
<p>By virtue of your solemn oath will you swear that any one of
</p>
<p>the parties you saw came in order such as the guard goes in when
</p>
<p>relieving the other guard at the Castle ? Some of them did.
</p>
<p>Was there any entire party came two and two ? Some of them
</p>
<p>did.
</p>
<p>On your oath were there not a great many women and children
</p>
<p>there ? Yes ; the women and children came after Mr. O'Connell.
</p>
<p>I mean after he came into town.
</p>
<p>Did they come in with the men ? They might have come in
</p>
<p>after the men.
</p>
<p>Were they not with the men ? Some of the parties I described
</p>
<p>had no women.
</p>
<p>Was there any party with women and children? Yes.
</p>
<p>Were they with all the parties? They might have come after
</p>
<p>the parties.
</p>
<p>Were there not lots of women and children in the military array?
</p>
<p>They might have followed the men.

</p>
<p>The women and children followed in the rear ? On the sides.
</p>
<p>Then the women were beside the men ? In some cases.
</p>
<p>Were they mixed with them ? Not with those men who came
</p>
<p>in as I described to you before.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell.  I do not want to entrap the witness, but I want
</p>
<p>him to give us a fair and honest statement of what took place, ac-
</p>
<p>cording to what he saw.
</p>
<p>Witness I am disposed to do so.
</p>
<p>Now, you talked of a drum-major ? I did.
</p>
<p>Do you know what a drum-major is ? I do.
</p>
<p>Had he a silver-headed cane in his hand ? He had a stick in his
</p>
<p>hand, the top of which was either silver or something representing
</p>
<p>silver.
</p>
<p>It was the band-master had that ? No, the drum-major.
</p>
<p>Is that the band-master ? No, it is not.
</p>
<p>248
</p>
<p>You knew them to be temperance bands, did you ? No ; they
</p>
<p>were all strangers to me.
</p>
<p>1 know you did not know them personally, but did you know
</p>
<p>them to be temperance bands ? I was informed that some of them
</p>
<p>were.
</p>
<p>And when the meeting was determined, and the speeches were
</p>
<p>over, all the people returned quietly home? They did.
</p>
<p>And their wives and children with them ? They all went away.
</p>
<p>At what hour? Between four and five o'clock.
</p>
<p>John Jolly examined by Mr. Brewster.
</p>
<p>lam Head Constable of Constabulary. I am stationed in the East
</p>
<p>Riding of Cork. I remember a meeting at Mallow, on the 11th of
</p>
<p>June, 1843. It was on Sunday. I was there. I went to Mallow in
</p>
<p>uniform, but changed to plain clothes before the meeting took place.
</p>
<p>It commenced about three o'clock. Before it commenced I saw a
</p>
<p>procession pass through Mallow in the direction in which I was told
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell would come. I cannot tell what road it was, for I was
</p>
<p>a stranger there. The procession was very numerous. There were
</p>
<p>several bands, and persons on horseback. They marched in regular
</p>
<p>order, with bands and banners ; the bands playing and banners flying.
</p>
<p>Some had cards in their button-holes, more had papers on their hats
</p>
<p>with " O'Connell's Police" printed on them. They marched four
</p>
<p>or six abreast, in column. The horsemen went much in the same way,
</p>
<p>apparently in regular order. I saw persons taking more particular
</p>
<p>command than others. Those men were outside the ranks, and
</p>
<p>gave directions to the column. Some of the men on horseback, who
</p>
<p>took commands, had wands with ribbons on the ends. It was late in
</p>
<p>the evening when the procession returned. I saw Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>and Mr. Steele with them. I do not remember ever seeing such a
</p>
<p>crowd before. I think there were hundreds of thousands of persons
</p>
<p>there. I saw Mr. O'Connell and Mr. Steele on the platform. It
</p>
<p>was near the shambles in Mallow. There was a large open space. It
</p>
<p>was nearly full. I was about ten yards from the platform. I took no
</p>
<p>notes. I heard part of Mr. O'Connell's speech. I can state the sub-

<p>stance of part of it. When I got to the platform I was told they were
</p>
<p>occupied in reading an Address. I heard him say, he had come there
</p>
<p>to tell them a secret, and he thought there was enough of them there
</p>
<p>to keep it. That the Union should be repealed in some time, which
</p>
<p>I do not recollect. He mentioned the time, but I did not hear it.
</p>
<p>He also said that they should have Ireland far the Irish. They might
</p>
<p>have England for the English, and Scotland for the Scotch, but Ire-
</p>
<p>land should be for the Irish ; and that he defied them to keep it, for
</p>
<p>they were too numerous, too determined, and too temperate. He
</p>
<p>said, that on the face of the earth there were not a greater pack of
</p>
<p>bribers than the British House of Commons, and that was admitted
</p>
<p>by some authority he then gave. He then asked the crowd did
</p>
<p>they ever hear talk of the man with the ugly name ?  Sugden. He
</p>
<p>said a friend of his in Kilkenny told him he would not call his
</p>
<p>249
</p>
<p>pig " Sugden ;" and as for the Lord Lieutenant, he was so igno-
</p>
<p>rant that he heard he sent a commissioner to see was Kilkenny
</p>
<p>a seaport. He then alluded to the police. There were some
</p>
<p>members of the police there, and he spoke of them. He said,
</p>
<p>that if they had made application to him, he would have ap-
</p>
<p>pointed several of his own police to keep the peace, and save the
</p>
<p>police the trouble of coming there. He said they sent the sol-
</p>
<p>diers to shoot them, but, said he, "they know a trick worth two
</p>
<p>of that." He said, " If we are attacked we will defend ourselves.
</p>
<p>" The sergeants of the English army are the finest body of men in
</p>
<p>" the world, but the worst treated. The French sergeants were
</p>
<p>" generally raised to the rank of officers ; they were a great deal
</p>
<p>" better treated than the English, by being promoted to the rank of
</p>
<p>" officers." He also began telling the crowd the effects of Repeal.
</p>
<p>He said, the labourers would be farmers, the farmers gentlemen,
</p>
<p>and the gentlemen members of parliament, no, not members of par-
</p>
<p>liament, but lords. He asked the crowd would they be ready to
</p>
<p>come again if he wanted them, and desired as many as would to
</p>
<p>hold up their hands. The crowd held up a wood of hands. He
</p>
<p>said when they came again he would require them to come armed,
</p>
<p>but the arms would be Repeal cards. At the word " armed" he made
</p>
<p>a pause. The meeting lasted two hours. Before Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>arrived there was a person on the platform who pointed to a person
</p>
<p>in the crowd to leave that; he addressed the people about him to
</p>
<p>cut the reins and drive him away, for he was an enemy. I cannot
</p>
<p>say whether the person referred to was on horseback, from the posi-
</p>
<p>tion I occupied.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined bv Mr. Whiteside.
</p>
<p>Are you acquainted with Mr. Johnston ? I have seen him.
</p>
<p>When did you see him last ? I saw him in the Court to-day.
</p>
<p>Did you see him last night ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Did you then know he was examined yesterday? I did.
</p>
<p>Did you talk about the trial with him ? No  he ran away from me.
</p>
<p>Have you not seen him frequently before the trials commenced ?

</p>
<p>Yes, I have.
</p>
<p>Did he not tell you he came here to be examined ? He did.
</p>
<p>When did you see Maguire last ? I saw him last night.
</p>
<p>May I ask your rank in the constabulary ? Head Constable.
</p>
<p>You are not an officer then ? No.
</p>
<p>Pray, where are you stationed? In Ballincollig, about six miles
</p>
<p>from Cork.
</p>
<p>May I ask what newspaper you take in ? I take in no newspaper.
</p>
<p>Well, then, what newspapers do you read ? I am glad to see any
</p>
<p>of them.
</p>
<p>I suppose you read the Cork Constitution ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Did you read an account of the Mallow meeting in any of the
</p>
<p>newspapers ? I will answer candidly ; I did not read any account
</p>
<p>of the meeting. I have no recollection that I did.
</p>
<p>2K
</p>
<p>250
</p>
<p>Try and remember. I cannot recollect ; upon my oath I do
</p>
<p>not.
</p>
<p>Will you tell me to-morrow if I meet you ? I cannot recollect
</p>
<p>that 1 did.
</p>
<p>Will you swear that you read no account of the meeting in a
</p>
<p>newspaper ? I will not.
</p>
<p>Were you ordered to go to Mallow ? I was.
</p>
<p>How were you dressed ? I went in regular uniform.
</p>
<p>Were you in Mallow the night before ? I was not ; I went there
</p>
<p>in the morning.
</p>
<p>Did you meet other policemen there ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Were the policemen dressed in uniform ? They were.
</p>
<p>Was Mr. Anderson, the Sub-Inspector, there? He was.
</p>
<p>Was Mr. Anderson out at the meeting ? He was.
</p>
<p>Does not he know Mallow better than you do ? He does.
</p>
<p>What time did you undress ? I cannot say exactly. The pro-
</p>
<p>cession was going through the town at the time.
</p>
<p>Do you swear the full procession was going through ? I say apart
</p>
<p>of it was going through ; the last part of it.
</p>
<p>What time did you leave the street to undress ? I was not in the
</p>
<p>street then ; I undressed in the barrack.
</p>
<p>What time of the day did you undress? I should think about
</p>
<p>I cannot exactly say.
</p>
<p>You are very precise about the words Mr. O'Connell used. What
</p>
<p>time did you put on the disguise ; was it one o'clock ? It might be
</p>
<p>about one o'clock.
</p>
<p>Was it one o'clock ? It might be more ; I think it was between
</p>
<p>one and two.
</p>
<p>Did you see the whole of the procession ? I do not know that I
</p>
<p>saw the whole of it ; I saw half of it.
</p>
<p>What half did you see ? The last half.
</p>
<p>Where did you see it ? I saw it going out of Mallow.
</p>
<p>Are you a constabulary man ? I am.
</p>
<p>You have fought no battles ? No.

</p>
<p>Oh ! then you are not a military, you are a civil man. Now you
</p>
<p>have said the procession marched in military order, with bands play-
</p>
<p>ing, colours flying ; are these words your own? Are they your own
</p>
<p>spontaneous effusion ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Were you not frightened by this military array, close columns and
</p>
<p>marching order ? No.
</p>
<p>What tunes did the bands play ; did they play " Paddy Carey,"
</p>
<p>or " Paddy from Cork," or : ' God Save the Queen ?" I took no
</p>
<p>notice.
</p>
<p>This was not a military procession ? No, a civil one.
</p>
<p>There were bands of music and banners ? I saw a great many
</p>
<p>banners.
</p>
<p>What do you mean by the horses being in apparently particular
</p>
<p>good order ; were they fat ? That would be good order.
</p>
<p>Now what became of the guns and muskets, the cannon, the dead
</p>
<p>251
</p>
<p>and wounded of this battle ? There were none at all. The horse-
</p>
<p>men were mounted five or six a-breast, and more after them.
</p>
<p>I see you are sure the horses' tails were not tied together. Were
</p>
<p>there real living men on them ? There were, and women behind
</p>
<p>the men.
</p>
<p>Yes, on pillions. Now tell us, did they charge you, or you charge
</p>
<p>them ? I did neither.
</p>
<p>Had the women their arms about the men ? They were hold-
</p>
<p>ing on.
</p>
<p>Now I have to ask a question suggested by Mr. Hatchell. Do
</p>
<p>you conceive that an offence against the Arms' Act ? So with music
</p>
<p>playing and banners flying, and women with arms round the men,
</p>
<p>they marched out of Mallow ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Were there no children there ? It would not be a place for them
</p>
<p>in the crowd.
</p>
<p>Were the bands temperance bands or timpera.nce? I do not un-
</p>
<p>derstand timperance.
</p>
<p>I beg your pardon. I assure you I mean no impeachment on your
</p>
<p>moral character. I wish to know do you think it better that the peo-
</p>
<p>ple should amuse themselves playing music or drinking whiskey ? In-
</p>
<p>deed I prefer the former.
</p>
<p>Why, you know in either case they are prosecuted, quacunque
</p>
<p>via, as we lawyers say. Did you make any report of this battle? I
</p>
<p>made no report ; I took no note.
</p>
<p>How, then, do you recollect Mr. O'Connell's speech? Because
</p>
<p>I took a great interest in hearing Mr. O'Connell speak.
</p>
<p>Are you a Repealer ? you took a great interest in Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell's speech you say ? I was glad to listen to a good speaker.
</p>
<p>You had better wait a little, then, and hear Mr. Hatchell and the
</p>
<p>rest here? I would be glad to hear gentlemen of eminence.
</p>
<p>How did you take a note of the pause; are you not to allow a
</p>
<p>pause in speaking? Certainly, Sir.
</p>
<p>I wish to know now, because it is odd a witness yesterday said
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell paused ? I took no note at all.

</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell told the people to come armed with the Repeal
</p>
<p>card ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Now, when you heard the word "armed" did you not nudge the
</p>
<p>man next you ? I was nudging him to get on as quick as I could.
</p>
<p>He said the sergeants in France got promotion; you cocked your
</p>
<p>ears at that ? Now, do you not expect to be promoted to the office

<p>of Head Constable when the trial is over ? That is for the Inspector-
</p>
<p>General.
</p>
<p>Well, the Inspector-General is a reasonable man, and do not you
</p>
<p>think it reasonable that a useful active man like you should be pro-
</p>
<p>moted ? It is reasonable.
</p>
<p>So Mr. O'Connell said when we got it (Repeal) the labourers
</p>
<p>will be farmers, the farmers gentlemen, and the gentlemen all lords?
</p>
<p>There will be no commoners then ? You will be a lord yourself,
</p>
<p>Lord Ballincollig ? He said so.
</p>
<p>252
</p>
<p>Tell me now which is all this, treason, conspiracy, sedition, or
</p>
<p>flat burglary? I never joke when I am on my oath.
</p>
<p>There was a country fellow on the platform who told a person
</p>
<p>in the crowd whom you did not see to be gone, and not create a dis-
</p>
<p>turbance ? I did not know what he might be doing.
</p>
<p>You have idle times in the North, I think ? It is very singular,
</p>
<p>the less I have to do the better 1 like it.
</p>
<p>Now did you not say you never joked when on your oath ?
</p>
<p>That is really no joke, Sir.
</p>
<p>You were not much pressed on that day? Indeed I was by the
</p>
<p>crowd.
</p>
<p>Why you are joking again, but there was nothing more to in-
</p>
<p>commode you  your whiskers were not pulled ? The crowd was
</p>
<p>very great.
</p>
<p>Were there ladies and gentlemen amongst them ? Neither.
</p>
<p>Did you dine comfortably that day, and had you a good bed ?
</p>
<p>It was pretty hard.
</p>
<p>When did you leave Mallow ? That evening.
</p>
<p>When did they ferret you out as a witness? About the month
</p>
<p>of December.
</p>
<p>Are there any respectable people in Mallow  any proprietors in
</p>
<p>the town  shopkeepers or landholders near it? Plenty.
</p>
<p>Why, then, have they pitched on you  a policeman who escaped
</p>
<p>to tell of your imminent hair-breadth escape from the scene of
</p>
<p>slaughter ? I was sent here.
</p>
<p>Re-examined by Mr. Brewster.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anderson, during the day, was for awhile in Barrack-square.
</p>
<p>He was not in the crowd. He was in the Court-house. 1 do not
</p>
<p>think he could conveniently hear what was going on.

<p>I am in the Constabulary. I am a Constable. I was stationed at

<p>Donard, six miles from Baltinglass. On the 6th of August, I was
</p>
<p>ordered into Baltinglass. I came there the evening before. I saw
</p>
<p>great numbers in the town between twelve and one o'clock. I saw

</p>
<p>them coming in waggons from Rathvilly. At that time I saw one
</p>
<p>band. I knew the Rev. Mr. Nolan at that time. The band was in
</p>
<p>a waggon. There were great numbers. I saw several banners, but
</p>
<p>1 do not recollect the inscriptions on them. I took no note of them.
</p>
<p>This was in the town of Baltinglass. The meeting was held near
</p>
<p>the town. I heard Mr. Nolan desire numbers of people to go to
</p>
<p>meet Mr. O'Connell. I heard a man saying, that "the shouts were
</p>
<p>frightening the pigeons." " Yes, and the Protestants too," said
</p>
<p>another. This was before Mr. Nolan. The waggon had gone over
</p>
<p>the bridge in the direction to meet Mr. O'Connell. I heard no other
</p>
<p>persons say it in the crowd. I cannot say when the band went to
</p>
<p>meet Mr. O'Connell. I was dressed much as I am dressed now, in
</p>
<p>253
</p>
<p>plain clothes. I cannot say what time I heard the expression, but I
</p>
<p>think it was between twelve and one. I met Mr. O'Connell on the
</p>
<p>road coming in, nearly about one o'clock. I heard a man say that
</p>
<p>this was the day that would frighten Saunders. I know Mr. Robert
</p>
<p>Saunders, he lives at Saunders-Grove, a little more than two English
</p>
<p>miles from Baltinglass. This was just before Mr. O'Connell came up.
</p>
<p>I made a memorandum the very day, just after the meeting. I do
</p>
<p>not recollect any other expression. I attended the place of meeting.
</p>
<p>I saw Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Lawlor, the Rev. Mr. Nolan, Mr. O'Farrell,
</p>
<p>the Roman Catholic Curate from Dunlavin, about eight miles off.
</p>
<p>I saw Mr. Copeland. He was Chairman. He lives at Dunlavin.
</p>
<p>That is about seven Irish miles from Baltinglass. I saw the two
</p>
<p>young Metcalfes, from the Park. I saw a man who was named to
</p>
<p>me as Mr. Steele. He is here. I saw young Mr. O'Connell there.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell spoke ; he said : " that he did not despair of getting
</p>
<p>the Repeal, for he had the people to back him ;" he also said : " there
</p>
<p>were some millions of money sent out of the country ;" he did not
</p>
<p>say how much ; he stated that the taxes were to be paid out of some
</p>
<p>fund; I heard him say something about Lord Wicklow ; I heard
</p>
<p>him call Mr. Fenton a " bog-trotting agent ; " I do not recollect
</p>
<p>that I heard him say any thing more. I heard Mr. O'Connell say that
</p>
<p>they would get the Repeal ; that they would not be refused, as they
</p>
<p>were all sober and determined men. I saw the Rev. Mr. Lawless
</p>
<p>there. He said he should have Repeal. He talked of having met some
</p>
<p>clergymen in travelling to Dublin, and that he would leave them the
</p>
<p>tithes during their natural lives. I cannot say how many were at
</p>
<p>the meeting. I was not alone. There was another man with me.
</p>
<p>The pressure was very great.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fitzgibbon.
</p>
<p>I have been back and forward to Baltinglass ten or eleven years.
</p>
<p>I am known there. I have been a policeman twelve years. I was
</p>
<p>always at Baltinglass in my uniform. I saw many that I knew in the
</p>
<p>crowd that day. Some near me, and some not. I was not insulted
</p>
<p>nor molested, nor even any expression used hurtful to my feelings.

</p>
<p>There was no attempt to remove me from the crowd. I might have
</p>
<p>got up to the platform. Mr. Nolan was near me. The person who
</p>
<p>made the reply that the meeting would frighten the Protestants, was
</p>
<p>near me. I saw him. I was within a yard of him. I did nothing.
</p>
<p>1 looked at him. I would not know him. He appeared to be a
</p>
<p>countryman. He was in a frieze coat. I did not know the man who
</p>
<p>spoke about frightening the pigeons. I cannot name any man
</p>
<p>who heard that expression. I endeavoured to avoid the notice
</p>
<p>and the eyes of those that knew me. Any place that I saw them,
</p>
<p>I would slip off to some other part of the crowd. I had no trou-
</p>
<p>ble to do that. I found a place where none knew me, in front
</p>
<p>of the platform, sometimes twenty, and sometimes ten yards from
</p>
<p>it, in different parts of the crowd. When I heard the expres-
</p>
<p>sion, " This is the day that will frighten Saunders," I was beyond
</p>
<p>254
</p>
<p>Hughes' hotel on the Dublin road. There was nobody I knew near
</p>
<p>me then. I cannot say whether any other person heard the expres-
</p>
<p>sion. I was near the man that said it. I do not know him. I did
</p>
<p>not ask him his name. I did not think it was my duty. I took a
</p>
<p>note of the expression between the time I heard it, and the termina-
</p>
<p>tion of the meeting. I did it on the side of the road.
</p>
<p>Show me your note ? I have not it here.
</p>
<p>Did you not, awhile ago, look at your note, and pretend to
</p>
<p>read it from your book ? I did, and I have it here [handing a
</p>
<p>paper to counsel].
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon.  Did you not awhile ago tell the jury that
</p>
<p>you made this note the day of meeting ? I did not tell them that
</p>
<p>note.
</p>
<p>Did you believe I was speaking of any thing else than that paper?
</p>
<p>Did you believe my question was about the paper in your hand, or
</p>
<p>any other paper ? I cannot answer that question.
</p>
<p>Now answer this simple question  where is the original note
</p>
<p>from which you say you wrote this book? I think it is burned.
</p>
<p>Dead men tell no tales : when did you burn it ? When I went
</p>
<p>home, after sending in my report.
</p>
<p>Were you ordered to take notes ? I was ordered to take notice
</p>
<p>of particular words.
</p>
<p>Do you mistake my words ? I do not remember that I was
</p>
<p>ordered to take notes. It was with a pencil I took notes : I went
</p>
<p>prepared with paper to take notes.
</p>
<p>Repeat the expression again respecting Saunders. I will : it was,
</p>
<p>" This is the day that will frighten Saunders."
</p>
<p>That is what you have written. Something to that effect. I heard
</p>
<p>words to that effect from several persons; some said, " Saunders will be
</p>
<p>frightened to-day." Another said, ' : Devil's cure to him, he would
</p>
<p>not come down and join the people for Repeal."
</p>
<p>Did you not tell me this minute that you made a note of the
</p>
<p>phrase ? I made a note of it upon the paper that was burned. I took
</p>
<p>notes that I did not mention in my report.

</p>
<p>Does the book in your hand correspond with the report which
</p>
<p>you furnished ? It is nearly the same as my report, but I cannot
</p>
<p>say it is exactly the same.
</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman.  If Mr. Fitzgibbon intends to cross-examine the
</p>
<p>Witness, with respect to the document, it should first be placed in
</p>
<p>his hands. That is the fixed rule of law.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon.  Mr. Freeman has misunderstood my question.
</p>
<p>I merely asked if the report which he delivered is the same as that
</p>
<p>which he had in his book. I did not ask him anything about the
</p>
<p>contents of the report.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General There is no misunderstanding of Mr.
</p>
<p>Fitzgibbon's question ; and I submit that question is illegal. The
</p>
<p>point was decided in the Queen's case, that a witness could not be
</p>
<p>examined as to the contents of a paper, without having it put into his
</p>
<p>hands. The question put by Mr. Fitzgibbon was : " does the book in
</p>
<p>255
</p>
<p>your hand correspond with the report which you furnished ?'' surely
</p>
<p>that is tantamount to an inquiry as to the contents of the paper.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  You had better put the question again,
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  Did you copy your report from the book in
</p>
<p>your hand ? In the first instance I made out my report from the
</p>
<p>notes which I took on the day of the meeting, and then I copied
</p>
<p>what I have in my book from my report. I copied the report which
</p>
<p>is in this book from the report which I sent into my officer.
</p>
<p>Did you copy the book from the report before you sent in the
</p>
<p>report ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Are you sure now ? Indeed I think I am. I have explained to
</p>
<p>you how it was. I took a report from my original notes, and sent
</p>
<p>it off, and a copy of that report I brought to my station.
</p>
<p>What became of that copy ? 1 do not know what has become
</p>
<p>of it. I dare say it is at home. I am sure I do not know ; stay,
</p>
<p>stay, I believe I have it here  yes, here it is. This is the report
</p>
<p>which I took from my original notes.
</p>
<p>Well, read it through and tell me do you find in it anything about
</p>
<p>" Devil's cure to Saunders ? No, there is nothing about it here.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  Why, Sir, you do not think it worth your while
</p>
<p>to look through your notes for it ? Oh, I know it is not in it.
</p>
<p>Where were you when you made out your report ? In a house
</p>
<p>in Baltinglass.
</p>
<p>Who owns that house ? I forget the man's name.
</p>
<p>You forget his name ? Yes, I do  all I know is, that he is a
</p>
<p>carpenter.
</p>
<p>He keeps a lodging-house  does he not ? Yes, he does.
</p>
<p>And you lodged in his house, and have been for ten or eleven
</p>
<p>years in Baltinglass, and yet notwithstanding all this, you foro-et his
</p>
<p>name ? I do not remember it. I never lodged in his house but
</p>
<p>once.
</p>
<p>Your memory must, indeed, be very treacherous, and yet you can
</p>
<p>remember what Mr. O'Connell said that day ! Passin gstrange that !

<p>I think I may let you go down, Sir.
</p>
<p>Witness  My Lords, I never was stationed at Baltinglass for
</p>
<p>more than a fortnight, and there are numbers of people there whom
</p>
<p>I do not know.
</p>
<p>Henry Twiss sworn, and examined by Mr. Martley.
</p>
<p>I am a Sub-Constable, and was so in the month of August last ; I
</p>
<p>was stationed at that time at Redcross in the county of Wicklow,
</p>
<p>which is thirty miles distant from Baltinglass ; I was at Baltinglass
</p>
<p>on the 6th of August last; there was a Repeal meeting there that
</p>
<p>day ; I arrived at Baltinglass the evening before ; I went there on
</p>
<p>duty ; I made a report to my officer of what I saw there ; I sent in
</p>
<p>my report on the morning of the next day; this document now
</p>
<p>handed to me is the report, and was written by me ; there was a
</p>
<p>great crowd at the meeting; lam not at all in the habit of estimat-
</p>
<p>256
</p>
<p>ing numbers, but I am sure there were, at all events, 5000 persons
</p>
<p>at the Baltinglass meeting; I am confident that I am greatly under
</p>
<p>the mark ; I saw Mr. O'Connell there, and others whom I do not
</p>
<p>know ; the chair was at one time occupied by a gentleman named
</p>
<p>Copeland, from near Dunlavin; another gentleman was subsequently
</p>
<p>called to the chair ; the second Chairman was some person from
</p>
<p>Kilcullen Bridge ; I was at. the meeting about one o'clock ; I mixed
</p>
<p>in the crowd ; I was ordered to attend the meeting in plain clothes,
</p>
<p>and I did so ; I saw people coming from various directions, some
</p>
<p>came from Carlow, others from Tullow ; I was on the platform at
</p>
<p>one time, at another time I was within five yards of it ; I heard peo-
</p>
<p>ple in the crowd make various political observations ; I heard some
</p>
<p>people saying, " Ireland was trampled on, but she shall be so no
</p>
<p>" longer."  " The time is nearer than you think. Let us wait
</p>
<p>" patiently for some months. Ireland was trampled on long enough,
</p>
<p>" but she shall be so no longer ;" the meeting lasted as well as I re-
</p>
<p>member from about half-past two to six o'clock ; I was shewn Mr.
</p>
<p>Steele there that day; I saw the Rev. Mr. Murtagh there; he made
</p>
<p>a speech ; I cannot state what he said, as I made no report of it.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Macdonagh.
</p>
<p>I took no notes of what was said by the speakers.
</p>
<p>I presume that when you heard the people say, " the time is
</p>
<p>nearer than you think," they were speaking of the Repeal of the
</p>
<p>Union ? I could not say ; but you may suppose so if you like.
</p>
<p>You are not able to ascribe any other meaning to it ; but the
</p>
<p>Repeal of the Union was the subject ihey were discussing? It was.
</p>
<p>Did you see all the people retire ? I cannot say I saw them all
</p>
<p>retire, but I saw them going away in every direction.
</p>
<p>There was no breach of the peace at that meeting ? Not that I
</p>
<p>could see.
</p>
<p>And no tendency to a breach of the peace ? No ; not the
</p>
<p>slightest.
</p>
<p>Everything went off very peaceably ? It did.

<p>I am a Police Constable. I was at Baltinglass on the 6th of Au-
</p>
<p>gust last. I saw the people coming into the town to meet Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell. I cannot say how many, but there were some thousands there.
</p>
<p>I saw them going over the bridge of Baltinglass on the Dublin road.
</p>
<p>I was at the meeting when Mr. O'Connell came there. I was in plain
</p>
<p>clothes. I was about thirty yards from the platform. I saw Father
</p>
<p>Lawlor of Baltinglass there, and Mr. Steele, and the Rev. Mr. Murtagh,
</p>
<p>of Kilcullen. I heard Mr. O'Connell tell the people that he was glad
</p>
<p>to see them there, and that he hoped they would be there when he
</p>
<p>came again ; they all shouted at that. After the meeting was over
</p>
<p>I went across the bridge towards Baltinglass, in the direction of the
</p>
<p>barracks. The place was very much thronged. I heard some of the
</p>
<p>people saying
</p>
<p>257
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore.  Docs your Lordship think this is evidence to affect
</p>
<p>the traversers ; vvhat was said or done by the people after the meet-
</p>
<p>ing had taken place, and whether that can give a character to the
</p>
<p>meeting.
</p>
<p>Mr. Tomb I submit that the effect produced by the meeting is
</p>
<p>evidence.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  The objection may be premature;
</p>
<p>but I think we cannot exclude the evidence.
</p>
<p>Witness.  I was obliged to stop on the bridge, it was so crammed,
</p>
<p>and there was such a lot of people there. One of them said " The
</p>
<p>Repeal is certain now ; we must get it." Another said, " If we do
</p>
<p>not get it quietly we will fight for it." Another said, " We will turn
</p>
<p>out to a man and fight for Repeal."
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore.  Do your Lordships consider the traversers ought to
</p>
<p>be affected by expressions that any individuals think fit to use after
</p>
<p>the meeting has separated. See how dangerous the effect of such a
</p>
<p>line of examination might be. Your Lordships have lately ruled,
</p>
<p>that if persons in coming to a meeting conduct themselves in a par-
</p>
<p>ticular way, and thereby give a character to the meeting, that would
</p>
<p>be admissible; but it would be going a very dangerous length to allow
</p>
<p>the traversers to be affected by conversation between individuals, when
</p>
<p>going home from a meeting. No man could possibly be safe if such
</p>
<p>a doctrine as that was held.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell.  A party might be affected by what took place at a
</p>
<p>meeting where he was present, and from which he had the option of
</p>
<p>withdrawing if he pleased, and not giving by his presence his sanc-
</p>
<p>tion to the proceedings. But suppose everything to have been fair,
</p>
<p>legal, and tranquil at a meeting, and when it separates, his connexion with
</p>
<p>it ceases, when it is impossible for him to set matters right, or to be an-
</p>
<p>swerable for the conduct or misconduct, the language or declarations of
</p>
<p>those parties, or of parties who may not have been at that meeting
</p>
<p>at all, although coming from the direction of it, it would be surely
</p>
<p>inconsistent that a man should be affected in character, property, li-
</p>
<p>berty, or perhaps in life, by the conversations of persons over whom

</p>
<p>he had no control.
</p>
<p>Mr. Tomb.  Perhaps I might be permitted to ask the Witness a
</p>
<p>question or two, as to the distance of the place, where he heard these
</p>
<p>expressions, from the place of meeting.
</p>
<p>How far is the bridge of Baltinglass from the place where the
</p>
<p>meeting was ? I think it was about half-a-mile.
</p>
<p>How long after the proceedings at the meeting was it you heard
</p>
<p>these expressions ? It was not an hour.
</p>
<p>Were the people going home from the meeting at the time ? They
</p>
<p>were going off in every direction.
</p>
<p>Mr. Tomb.  I respectfully submit that this is a proper question to
</p>
<p>be asked, and that the evidence as to what the Witness heard the
</p>
<p>people say on the bridge is admissible, on the grounds that it tends
</p>
<p>to shew what the nature of the meeting was, and the effect likely to
</p>
<p>be produced bv the language used. The people who used the ex-
</p>
<p>2L
</p>
<p>258
</p>
<p>pressions sworn to by the witness, appear to have been part of the
</p>
<p>crowd tbat met at that meeting and listened to what was said.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  Was it in a house you heard those
</p>
<p>words ?
</p>
<p>Witness No, on the bridge.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  I thought you went into a house.
</p>
<p>Mr. Tomb.  No, my Lord, he said the bridge. The evidence of
</p>
<p>the witness is admissible, inasmuch as it characterizes that meeting.
</p>
<p>I am not aware that there is any express or direct authority upon
</p>
<p>this point ; but in the case of the Manchester riots, it was ruled that
</p>
<p>the persons, who seemed to have attended a meeting, showed the
</p>
<p>nature of that meeting.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore.  In the absence of authority, the Court must look to
</p>
<p>the principles of common sense and common justice. Is every indi-
</p>
<p>vidual who has attended a meeting to be made responsible for every
</p>
<p>thing which may be said, an hour after the meeting, by persons who
</p>
<p>may act illegally or make use of illegal expressions? That is incon-
</p>
<p>sistent alike with common sense and with common justice.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General.  My Lords, I conceive that it is incon-
</p>
<p>sistent neither with common sense nor with common justice to
</p>
<p>receive this evidence. On the contrary, it would be inconsistent
</p>
<p>with common sense and common justice not to make the parties ac-
</p>
<p>countable for what was said and done after the meeting. In the case
</p>
<p>of Redford v. Birly the expressions used by persons going to the
</p>
<p>meeting were admitted by Mr. Justice Holroyd, and his decision was
</p>
<p>affirmed by the Court of King's Bench, on a motion for a new trial,
</p>
<p>as showing the character of the meeting. In that case, on the part
</p>
<p>of the defendant, it was proposed to examine a Mr. Andrews, who
</p>
<p>stated that he resided within two miles of Manchester, on the road
</p>
<p>from Manchester to Whitecross. The counsel for the defendant
</p>
<p>were proceeding to examine him as to the fact of his having seen
</p>
<p>bodies of men in the night of the 14th of August marching along the
</p>
<p>road near his house, and as to expressions used by them. It was ob-
</p>
<p>jected that those facts were not admissible in evidence, unless it

</p>
<p>was shown that the plaintiff was one of the party. Mr. Justice Hol-
</p>
<p>royd said that he was clearly of opinion that the evidence proposed
</p>
<p>was admissible as to part of the facts in issue. One of the issues was,
</p>
<p>whether a certain unlawful, wicked, and seditious conspiracy had not
</p>
<p>been entered into, to excite discontent and disaffection in the minds
</p>
<p>of the people, and hatred and contempt of the Government and con-
</p>
<p>stitution, &c, therefore the transactions which occurred in Manchester
</p>
<p>and the neighbourhood were clearly admissible evidence, which he
</p>
<p>was bound to hear when adduced for the purpose of proving that such
</p>
<p>a conspiracy did exist. What was said by a person leaving a meeting
</p>
<p>shows the character of it, just as much as what was said going to a
</p>
<p>meeting. We have in evidence the remarkable expression of Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell, " If I want you won't you come again ?" We have also in
</p>
<p>evidence the language used by persons who attended the meeting, that
</p>
<p>they were ready to turn out to a man and fight for Repeal if neces-
</p>
<p>259
</p>
<p>sary. The question for the jury is, how was that language under-
</p>
<p>stood ? Common sense shows that the best way of proving that, is
</p>
<p>by the expressions of parties leaving the meeting, rather than by
</p>
<p>the expressions which were used before the meeting. At the time
</p>
<p>this conversation took place the meeting was not over : the people
</p>
<p>were dispersing. It is, therefore, part of the res gestce at the meeting.
</p>
<p>In Regina v . Dammanie, 15 Howell's St. Tr., 553, evidence of the
</p>
<p>expressions used by the mob who accompanied Dr. Sacheverell to
</p>
<p>the Temple was admitted. Nothing can be more important to show
</p>
<p>how the people understood the language of the speakers than the
</p>
<p>conversation of persons leaving the meeting. Suppose some of the
</p>
<p>parties had pulled down Mr. Saunders's house as they were returning
</p>
<p>from the meeting, that might be given in evidence against every one
</p>
<p>who took part in the meeting, and they would be responsible for it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  The case cited by the Attorney General makes
</p>
<p>for us. In that case, expressions of the mob who accompanied Dr.
</p>
<p>Sacheverell to the Temple were admitted ; but it is not stated that
</p>
<p>those expressions were used after the meeting. Here are two men
</p>
<p>who are nearly half a mile from the place, after the meeting took place.
</p>
<p>If that can be given in evidence, i he acts of the parties the next
</p>
<p>day may be admitted. In Lord George Gordon's case, the expres-
</p>
<p>sions were used by the mob, when they were pulling down a house.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General.  In page 553, you will find that it was
</p>
<p>the mob who accompanied Dr. Sacheverell home to the Temple,
</p>
<p>who used the expressions ; that must have been after the meeting.
</p>
<p>We rely on this evidence as part of the res gestce.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton The evidenee in Daniel Damn-lame's
</p>
<p>case was, that the mob accompanied Dr. Sacheverell to the Temple,
</p>
<p>but it does not say that they did so after the meeting. That is a
</p>
<p>very important fact.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin.  It would be a very different thing if the
</p>
<p>shouts were made by the whole body, but this is a conversation be-
</p>
<p>tween two men who were apparently connected with the meeting.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice  Let it be ascertained whether these

<p>persons were at the meeting.
</p>
<p>Mr. Tomb.  Where were the men ? On the bridge when I
</p>
<p>came up. I cannot swear that they formed a portion of the people
</p>
<p>who were at the meeting.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  The Crown must withdraw the
</p>
<p>evidence ; and if the Jury have taken a note of it, they must strike
</p>
<p>it out.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Moore.
</p>
<p>I came from Holywood, about fourteen miles from Baltinglass,
</p>
<p>the night before. Captain Drought is the Stipendiary Magistrate of
</p>
<p>that district. He was at Baltinglass the day before. I knew of the
</p>
<p>meeting before, as it was quite notorious. I heard of it for about
</p>
<p>three weeks before that time. It was quite notorious in all the dis-
</p>
<p>trict, and we all knew it was a meeting for the Repeal of the Union.
</p>
<p>All was quiet at the meeting. There was perfect peace, no acts of
</p>
<p>2G0
</p>
<p>violence were committed. I did not see anything like the least
</p>
<p>breach of the peace.
</p>
<p>Re-examined by Mr. Tomb.
</p>
<p>Captain Drought was very unwell that day, and could not attend
</p>
<p>the meeting.
</p>
<p>Manus Hughes sworn, and examined by Mr. Holmes.
</p>
<p>I am in the Police, acting as Constable. I was stationed in Au-
</p>
<p>gust within twenty-one miles of Baltinglass ; I was at Baltinglass on
</p>
<p>the 6th August last ; there was a great assemblage of people there on
</p>
<p>that clay. I think I know Mr. O'Connell. He was pointed out
</p>
<p>to me at the meeting. I never saw him before. I went to Baltin-
</p>
<p>glass the day before the meeting. I went to the meeting in plain
</p>
<p>clothes ; people were coming into the town all the morning. I saw
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell about two o'clock ; he came in by the turnpike-road,
</p>
<p>the Dublin one ; there were a great many people with him ; when
</p>
<p>I saw him it was when he was coming near the platform. I did not
</p>
<p>see him until he was near the platform. I heard people speak of Mr.
</p>
<p>Saunders, before Mr. O'Connell came in. I took notes of what passed
</p>
<p>that day. I wrote them out next morning. I will swear to their
</p>
<p>correctness. I heard three or four people say that Mr. Saunders'
</p>
<p>house ought to be attacked, because it was once the seat of blood ;
</p>
<p>this was said before Mr. O'Connell came in. I heard them say nothing
</p>
<p>more, except that Mr. O'Connell ordered to pull up opposite Mr.
</p>
<p>Saunders' house, until he had him cheered ; this is what caused the
</p>
<p>conversation about the attack, A man came up who said he saw
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell at Mr. Saunders'. I heard a part of Mr. O'Connell's
</p>
<p>speech. I heard him say he would do away with the poor laws and
</p>
<p>taxes, and that the poor would be supported from the consolidated
</p>
<p>fund. Mr. O'Connell ordered the carriage to stop to have Mr.
</p>
<p>Saunders cheered. I heard some person say he gave those orders.
</p>
<p>I heard the crowd say they would and should have the Repeal ;
</p>
<p>that was before the crowd dispersed. I heard no other expression ;
</p>
<p>the expression I have just mentioned was used after the people left
</p>
<p>the field where the meeting was held. I heard no other expressions

<p>used but those I have mentioned before.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mb. O'Hagan.
</p>
<p>I came from Tara the night before. I cannot tell the time that
</p>
<p>the people began to come in. I had no work to do in my capacity
</p>
<p>of a policeman. There was no breach of the peace that I saw, or
</p>
<p>even the appearance of it. I heard one person say, when Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell called to have three cheers for Mr. Saunders, that he ought to
</p>
<p>be attacked. I was then upon the platform. The crowd was very
</p>
<p>thick. There was not any other policeman there with me. I had
</p>
<p>an Inspector there that day, but he was not at the meeting. There
</p>
<p>was a superior in rank to me there, Constable Godfrey, and one
</p>
<p>other constable. I am not certain whether Mr. Hawkshaw was
</p>
<p>there that day. I was speaking to him one part of it. When Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell said there should be a cheer for Mr. Saunders, the people
</p>
<p>201
</p>
<p>said lie should be attacked. After the meeting was over, the people
</p>
<p>went away peaceable.
</p>
<p>Re-examined by Mr. Holmes.
</p>
<p>I saw Mr. Hawkshaw in the town but not at the meeting.
</p>
<p>John Taylor sworn, and e xamined by the Attorney-General.
</p>
<p>I am a Police Constable; I was in Baltinglass on the 6th of Au-
</p>
<p>gust ; I am not stationed there ; I came in there on Saturday ; I saw
</p>
<p>the meeting collecting; there were bands at it; the people came
</p>
<p>from different parts ; there were great numbers at the meeting,
</p>
<p>about a couple of thousand ; I was sometimes within about nine or
</p>
<p>ten yards of the platform ; I saw a gentleman who was called Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell there ; he made a speech ; I took no note of it at the
</p>
<p>time or afterwards ; I heard Mr. O'Connell say he would get the
</p>
<p>Repeal if the people stood to him ; he was able to get it ; I heard
</p>
<p>him say what a blessed thing it would be to have the Repeal; there
</p>
<p>was the Earl of Wicklow a member of parliament, and what did he
</p>
<p>do for Ireland ? He was happy to see them there, and if he wanted
</p>
<p>them again he asked them would they not come, and they all shouted
</p>
<p>that they would come, and they held up their hands. When he said
</p>
<p>he would get the Repeal of the Union if they would stand to him,
</p>
<p>they said they would stand to him, and fight for it if necessary. I
</p>
<p>heard nothing else from any of the crowd assembled there. I heard
</p>
<p>another gentleman speak, whom I heard the people call Mr. O'Reilly ;
</p>
<p>he spoke of the villanous government, who put Irishmen in the way
</p>
<p>of having their bones perishing in foreign lands  perishing at Cabul
</p>
<p> Devil's cure to them, why did they go there ? he also said he
</p>
<p>hoped they [the people] would never put themselves in such a way,
</p>
<p>and they said not ; I remember nothing further.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'Carthy.
</p>
<p>I am a policeman of the lowest grade. I saw Captain Conway,
</p>
<p>the County Inspector, at the meeting. I am not in the habit of re-
</p>
<p>porting speeches at meetings. On the 6th of August I had occasion
</p>
<p>to refresh my memory of what took place, and having allowed six
</p>
<p>months to pass, I now come to give evidence without a note of what

</p>
<p>took place. Mr. O'Connell did use the words " We will have a Re-
</p>
<p>peal of the Union if you stand to me." I did not see Mr. Hawk-
</p>
<p>shaw at the meeting, nor Mr. Drought.
</p>
<p>A Juror.  Repeat what Mr. O'Reilly said in his speech respect-
</p>
<p>ing the emigration of the people by the villanous Government. He
</p>
<p>said : " See how that villanous Government has treated Irishmen,
</p>
<p>leaving their bones to perish in a foreign land, in Cabul."
</p>
<p>John M'Cann examined by Mr. Smyly.
</p>
<p>I am a Constable, and was stationed in August last in Drummar-
</p>
<p>tin station, in the county of Monaghan. I know a place called Clon-
</p>
<p>tibret, and was there on the 15th of August last. There was a
</p>
<p>meeting held there on that day. It was a large meeting. I did not
</p>
<p>2G2
</p>
<p>see the entire of the persons present, as I made it a point to attend
</p>
<p>to the speakers. I can tell some parts of a few of the speeches. I
</p>
<p>took a few notes. I took them on that day [day of meeting]. I can
</p>
<p>speak from memory of the Rev. Mr. Tierney's speech. He spoke
</p>
<p>very briefly. A gentleman followed him who was called Counsellor
</p>
<p>M'Mahon. Next Mr. O'Neill Daunt. I forgot to mention-that the
</p>
<p>Chairman was speaking when I went on the platform. Captain Seaver
</p>
<p>was the Chairman. A Mr. Jackson spoke also at the meeting, and a
</p>
<p>Mr. Conway, the Editor of the Newry Examiner. I took short
</p>
<p>notes of what the Rev. Mr. Tiemey said. He said the Union was car-
</p>
<p>ried by every species of fraud and corruption. In consequence of the
</p>
<p>crushing I got, I could not write any more of what he said. I re-
</p>
<p>collect seeing the Rev. Mr. Tierney some time before the meeting
</p>
<p>took place. I saw him convenient to his own house. He lives in
</p>
<p>the townlands of Slisnaganchin. I had a conversation with him
</p>
<p>about the meeting. I was instructed to inquire of Mr. Tierney, in
</p>
<p>consequence of the many reports, when the meeting would take
</p>
<p>place. I went to ask him if he would have the kindness to let me
</p>
<p>know when the meeting would take place. As nearly as I can recol-
</p>
<p>lect, when I went to him, the conversation was this. He said, the
</p>
<p>day was not yet fixed ; that it depended upon the convenience of
</p>
<p>some barristers, to whom he had written, to attend. He adverted to
</p>
<p>the Union ; and he repeated that it had been fraudulently carried.
</p>
<p>He said it was not binding; he represented it to be a nullity and a
</p>
<p>concoction ; that it was not binding upon conscience. He said that
</p>
<p>the feeling towards Repeal was becoming general ; that it had ex-
</p>
<p>tended itself to the army ; that the army were favourable to repeal,
</p>
<p>and partook of the enthusiasm of the people ; and that they could
</p>
<p>not be so easily led to spill the blood of their fellow-men by the
</p>
<p>bayonet, for seeking redress of their grievances peaceably. I remem-
</p>
<p>ber him speaking as to what the army had done in Spain. That
</p>
<p>was on the 16th of June.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore I object to the Witness being examined as to a pri-
</p>
<p>vate conversation occurring so long before the meeting. We came

</p>
<p>here prepared to meet certain overt acts stated in the indictment.
</p>
<p>One of those overt acts is the meeting of the 15th of August, but we
</p>
<p>are not in any manner apprised, either by the bill of particulars or
</p>
<p>by the indictment, of a conversation alleged to have taken place
</p>
<p>two months before the meeting. If the Crown is at liberty to give
</p>
<p>evidence of a conversation occurring two months before the meeting,
</p>
<p>it might go back ten years before it ; I do not know anything that
</p>
<p>would make any difference with regard to time. It is hard to be pre-
</p>
<p>pared to repel anything this witness said, not being apprised that such
</p>
<p>evidence was to be given.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice  The conversation is a declaration by
</p>
<p>one of the parties himself respecting the preparation for a meeting
</p>
<p>that had been spoken of as known, and that was to take place. The
</p>
<p>Witness, desiring to attend, asked to be informed at what time it was
</p>
<p>to take place. He wen to Mr. Tierney himself for the purpose of
</p>
<p>inquiring, and he was t Id that he could not say exactly, but that it
</p>
<p>263
</p>
<p>would be held shortly, for he had written to certain barristers who
</p>
<p>were to attend, but there was some uncertainty as to when they could
</p>
<p>come. Surely this has some reference to the part Mr. Tierney took
</p>
<p>at Clontibret, which is one of the overt acts alleged against Mr.
</p>
<p>Tierney.
</p>
<p>Mr. Stnyly  You just began to say something about what Mr.
</p>
<p>Tierney said respecting the soldiers in Spain.
</p>
<p>Did Mr. Tierney say anything more ? He did; the conversa-
</p>
<p>tion might have lasted about a quarter of an hour; but I cannot
</p>
<p>charge my memory with everything that occurred.
</p>
<p>Do you recollect anything more ? He spoke about the Associa-
</p>
<p>tion ; he said if it did not ultimately attain its object, it would, at
</p>
<p>least, have done thus much  that the country would get something-
</p>
<p>else besides bayonets.
</p>
<p>Judge Perrin Repeat that  repeat what he did say ? He
</p>
<p>said that the Association, even if it should not finally or ultimately
</p>
<p>succeed in attaining its object, it had done so much at least, that the
</p>
<p>country would get other measures than the bayonet; or words to
</p>
<p>that effect.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Smyly.  About what number attended the meeting of
</p>
<p>the 15th of August ? It is very difficult to form an estimate.
</p>
<p>Can you make a guess at the number ? I mentioned before
</p>
<p>that I did not see all the people there, as my attention was directed
</p>
<p>off from them ; I heard persons say there were 30,000.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Moore.
</p>
<p>I am stationed in the parish of Clontibret. I have been quar-
</p>
<p>tered there since 1841. Mr. Tierney is the Roman Catholic clergy-
</p>
<p>man of the parish. I cannot say how long he has been so. There
</p>
<p>was not any person with me when I had the conversation with Mr.
</p>
<p>Tierney on the 16th of June. When I first went up to Mr. Tierney
</p>
<p>lie was in conversation with another man, who went away as soon as
</p>
<p>he saw me approaching. I do not think he could have heard any-
</p>
<p>thing that subsequently occurred. There were some persons work-
</p>
<p>ing in an adjoining field a few perches off, but it is my impression

</p>
<p>that they did not hear anything that we said. I rather think they
</p>
<p>did not hear us, for Mr. Tierney did not speak in a very loud voice.
</p>
<p>I cannot speak for certain on the matter, but I have no doubt upon
</p>
<p>my own mind but that the people in the field did not hear us. They
</p>
<p>were more than ten yards off. I can write. I was at the meeting in
</p>
<p>question, and I was dressed in my policeman's clothes. I was on
</p>
<p>the platform, and I took some notes of what was said. I have
</p>
<p>them with me. I made a short note in my diary of my conversa-
</p>
<p>tion with Mr. Tierney, on the 16th of June. I have a copy of it
</p>
<p>with me. The diary is at the station, in the care of the senior
</p>
<p>constable. The note is to this effect: "Friday, 16th of June, saw
</p>
<p>" Priest Tierney on the subject of the Clontibret Repeal meeting, who
</p>
<p>" said that the period was not fixed as yet, and that it depended on
</p>
<p>" the convenience of barristers who were to attend, and who would
</p>
<p>" give the authorities sufficient notice, &c, &c, &c." That is the
</p>
<p>264
</p>
<p>whole of what I took down on the subject of the meeting. There is
</p>
<p>not a word of Mr. Tierney's having spoken about Repeal and Spain
</p>
<p>in my diary. I have no note of the conversation with regard to Spain
</p>
<p>and the army. When I understood I was to be examined from Cap-
</p>
<p>tain Johnston, I took a sort of note of it. That was some time in
</p>
<p>October. I am not a Roman Catholic. I knew Mr. Tierney before
</p>
<p>the 16th of June. He knew me to be a policeman. I had on my
</p>
<p>uniform on the 16th.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore.  Ha? Mr. Tierney ever assisted you in keeping the
</p>
<p>peace in the parish ? If Mr. Tierney wishes me to speak of any as-
</p>
<p>sistance he has given me, or if the Court should deem it expedient
</p>
<p>that I should do so, I will tell you ; otherwise I would not wish to
</p>
<p>reveal what I consider to be a secret.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice.  The Court has no objection to your
</p>
<p>making any statement you please, in reference to what you have
</p>
<p>been asked.
</p>
<p>Witness.  He has assisted me, inasmuch as he has sent for me,
</p>
<p>and given me information in reference to the concealing of a birth,
</p>
<p>and
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore.  We do not want to hear anything about that. Go
</p>
<p>on, and say in what other way he has assisted ycu ? He also gave
</p>
<p>me information about another girl deserting her child. There were
</p>
<p>magistrates at the meeting at Clontibret. I saw Mr. Plunket and
</p>
<p>Mr. Golden there, but they were not on the platform. There were
</p>
<p>military and police there, but I do not know who sent them. I do
</p>
<p>not recollect having heard that they were sent to the meeting at the
</p>
<p>request or suggestion of Mr. Tierney, but I will not swear that I did
</p>
<p>not hear it. The meeting was a peaceable one. I saw no violence
</p>
<p>of any sort at the meeting, but I could not say how long it lasted.
</p>
<p>I took the note now produced while the meeting was held. It has
</p>
<p>nothing in it with reference to the resolutions moved, or to any pe-
</p>
<p>tition read. Captain Seaver was in the chair. Captain Wilcocks,
</p>
<p>Mr. Plunkett, Mr. Goold, and Mr. Hamilton, the magistrates, were
</p>
<p>there also.

<p>last August, and was present at the Repeal meeting. I was on duty,
</p>
<p>and on the platform. I heard the several speakers distinctly. I was
</p>
<p>on the platform when Captain Seaver, the Chairman, spoke, and I
</p>
<p>heard him. I took a note of what he said, but I could not under-
</p>
<p>take to say what the precise words were. I heard him ask : " Whether
</p>
<p>" they had all got Repeal cards, and if not, they should lose no time
</p>
<p>" in getting them, for he had reason to know that other associations
</p>
<p>" had signs and passwords by which they might know each other,
</p>
<p>" and why should not they ?" The Chairman also said, " I know no
</p>
<p>" other better way of your knowing each other, than your getting
</p>
<p>" Repeal cards." The Chairman afterwards desired the meeting to
</p>
<p>go home quietly, and insult no person. I also heard Mr. O'Neil
</p>
<p>Daunt speak, and took a note of what he said. He commenced by
</p>
<p>265
</p>
<p>saying " I bless God I belong to this land, and to this people. You,
</p>
<p>" the people, should have this land if you are worthy, and who dare
</p>
<p>u say that you are not ?" I heard Mr. Daunt also say, " the Repeal
</p>
<p>" now or never. Now and for ever  if Peel and Wellington came
</p>
<p>11 and said,  we will give you everything you want, only give up
</p>
<p>" Repeal,' we would tell them we would not  never." I also heard
</p>
<p>him say in another part of his speech, " Before God we swear they
</p>
<p>" shall not bully us longer. If we had an Irish Parliament once we
</p>
<p>" would have the power to keep it ; but we must now stand to our
</p>
<p>** colours, and persevere in the course O'Connell pointed out to us ;
</p>
<p>" then in place of six struggles or battles for Repeal, one will do for
</p>
<p>" all."
</p>
<p>Did he say anything more ? Yes, he said : K Are we not as good
</p>
<p>as the English?" A voice said, "better." " We are here to day,
</p>
<p>" to tell John Bull that we shall have it. Ireland shall be free, for Ire-
</p>
<p>" land deserves her liberty. Tlie Clontibret boys will fight the Repeal
</p>
<p>" battle to the last, with God's blessing, to stand to our colours for Re-
</p>
<p>" peal, and nothing but Repeal."
</p>
<p>Is that the whole of it ? It is.
</p>
<p>Did you hear other speakers address the assembly? I did.
</p>
<p>Who did you hear ? I heard Mr. M'Mahon ; he was introduced
</p>
<p>as Counsellor M'Mahon ; he spoke to a resolution which was moved
</p>
<p>by the Rev. Thomas Tierney.
</p>
<p>Do you know any of the gentlemen who are traversers here ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Did you see any of them at that meeting ? I saw the Rev. Mr.
</p>
<p>Tierney, but none other of the traversers.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Henn.
</p>
<p>W T ere you on the platform ? I was when I took part of the notes,
</p>
<p>but not when I took the whole. I was on the ground when I took
</p>
<p>the part relating to Mr. O'Neill Daunt. I took Captain Seaver's on
</p>
<p>the platform. He spoke loud. So did Mr. Daunt. I was in uni-
</p>
<p>form when I was taking the notes. There were but three police
</p>
<p>there in uniform. There were others at a distance from the plat-
</p>
<p>form. I saw no magistrates immediately at the platform ; they were

</p>
<p>at some distance. I was at the end of the platform ; it might have
</p>
<p>been two or three yards from it when I heard Mr. Daunt speak.
</p>
<p>Struggles, not battles, was the word he used. The meeting was
</p>
<p>perfectly quiet. It was most peaceable. I was on the platform in
</p>
<p>uniform. There was no objection to my taking notes there. I spoke
</p>
<p>to a person who was pushing up, and said : " You will see the ac-
</p>
<p>count in the newspapers in a day or two," and he replied : " No
</p>
<p>doubt; but we do not want to see the notes you take of it." All
</p>
<p>was perfectly quiet and tranquil.

</p>
<p>I am a Sub-Inspector of Constabulary. I am stationed in the neigh-
</p>
<p>bourhood of Tara, at Trim, in the county of Meath. I remember
</p>
<p>the 15th of August, the day of the meeting at Tara. I was there
</p>
<p>that day. There were two other officers of the constabulary with
</p>
<p>2M
</p>
<p>26G
</p>
<p>me. I was there under the command of Captain Despard, Stipen-
</p>
<p>diary magistrate. Captain Despard was there. I was on the ground
</p>
<p>before the meeting commenced ; when on the ground I saw part of
</p>
<p>the people coming; they approached to the meeting from all direc-
</p>
<p>tions ; there were probably 100,000 persons present. I observed
</p>
<p>music and banners. There were also bands. The bands generally
</p>
<p>had certain uniforms. I saw a harp, but I did not hear it played. I
</p>
<p>knew Mr. O'Connell before. I saw Mr. O'Connell there. I did not
</p>
<p>see any of the other traversers there. I was there nearly an hour
</p>
<p>before he arrived, and the people were coming to the meeting from
</p>
<p>various directions. There was a platform erected before Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell arrived. It was down from the church fifty or sixty perches or
</p>
<p>more. Mr. Despard was there at the time.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Close.
</p>
<p>I was for some hours through the crowd that day. Their de-
</p>
<p>meanour was perfectly peaceable. I observed females there. There
</p>
<p>were many carnages, and a good number of ladies. The bands were
</p>
<p>temperance bands. For a considerable time before that meeting they
</p>
<p>dressed in fancy dresses.
</p>
<p>George Despard sworn, and examined by Sergeant Warren.
</p>
<p>I was in the constabulary. I am now resident Magistrate in the
</p>
<p>county of Meath. I recollect the 15th of August; I was in the town
</p>
<p>of Trim ; that morning there was an assemblage of people, who
</p>
<p>formed in Trim, and marched through the town, in ranks four deep
</p>
<p>towards Tara, which is about six Irish miles from Trim. There were
</p>
<p>bands in carriages preceding them. There were persons who had
</p>
<p>wands who assumed command. I heard some of them say, " keep
</p>
<p>your ranks"  "keep your step." I went to Tara by a different road.
</p>
<p>Not the twentieth part of the persons assembled passed through
</p>
<p>Trim. I knew a man there from Kildare. There were men from
</p>
<p>Tipperary, Wexford, Dublin, and Westmeath there. One man told
</p>
<p>me he came from Nenagh, another from Wexford  I knew this only
</p>
<p>because they told me so. I was at Tara some time before Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell came there. Various parties marched up in procession

</p>
<p>with bands playing and banners flying, but not perhaps as regularly as
</p>
<p>they passed through Trim. It would be impossible to form an ac-
</p>
<p>curate estimate of the numbers. My own opinion is, lhat there
</p>
<p>were 100,000 persons present, at least. Perhaps in saying so, I am
</p>
<p>under the mark. I calculated there were about 7,000 horsemen. I
</p>
<p>counted nineteen bands. I did not see any persons on the Hill of
</p>
<p>Tara assuming the command. Mr. O'Connell's procession came up
</p>
<p>at two o'clock. When he got on the platform a great many people
</p>
<p>crowded on it, and I think within an hour and a half, a sudden move-
</p>
<p>ment took place, and they all went away in bodies of 20,000, as if
</p>
<p>there was a pre-concerted plan. They separated about four o'clock,
</p>
<p>in the ordinary way a crowd would separate. I heard some obser-
</p>
<p>vations. I was standing on a ditch as Mr. O'Connell came by, when a
</p>
<p>respectable, well-dressed man turned to me and said: " It is not gen-
</p>
<p>267
</p>
<p>tlemen O'Connell wants here to-day." I turned and looked at him,
</p>
<p>and asked what he wanted ? he said, "he wants men with bone and
</p>
<p>sinew, that will be able to do the work when it comes." Mr. Walker,
</p>
<p>the Sub-Inspector, and Major Westenra, were standing near me. I
</p>
<p>said : " I suppose men like those frieze-coated fellows there." Just
</p>
<p>so, said he. May I ask you, said I, where you came from ? I came
</p>
<p>from the barony of Shilmalier, in the county of Wexford. I said,
</p>
<p>"pray, did many come with you?" "Yes," said he, "two thousand came
</p>
<p>from Wexford, and three thousand joined us in Kildare." When Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell's procession had passed by, he said : "you did not take off
</p>
<p>your hat to Mr. O'Connell ; you do not belong to our party." " Cer-
</p>
<p>tainly not," said I. He said, " I knew by the curl of your lip you did
</p>
<p>not." I said ; " I am very glad to hear that your eyes told you so much
</p>
<p>truth, I am only amusing myself ; I do not belong to any party." He
</p>
<p>said : " Oh! no matter, we will let you come on the field, for all that."
</p>
<p>A countryman then came up, and said to him : "you do not know
</p>
<p>that gentleman ; you had better leave him alone." They said, when
</p>
<p>they saw Major Westenra, " Long life to the furriner." I think
</p>
<p>they mistook Major Westenra for a foreigner, on account of his
</p>
<p>moustache. " We can't get Repeal without them ; long life to Lea-
</p>
<p>ther Roland." I afterwards found out, it was Mr. Ledru Rollin
</p>
<p>they meant.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined hy Mr. Hatchell.
</p>
<p>I do not reside in Trim, I slept there the night before ; I was
</p>
<p>desired to attend there ; it is my duty to attend all public, meetings
</p>
<p>of the kind ; I saw the people move from Trim ; I went to the head
</p>
<p>of the town to make a calculation ; I have been twenty years sta-
</p>
<p>tioned in that district ; I generally attend fairs, petty sessions, quarter
</p>
<p>sessions; I am well known both by men, women, and children; I
</p>
<p>am sure they all know me except those who came from Westmeath ;
</p>
<p>I went to the end of the town, and I jumped on a wall and stood
</p>
<p>there ; they did not give me a cheer ; I am afraid they did not think
</p>
<p>me their general ; they saw me perfectly well ; the band preceded
</p>
<p>them; I reside in the county; Rathline is the nearest village to me;

<p>the Trim band is the nearest band ; it was dressed in a new uniform
</p>
<p>before that ; I saw them on the Patrick's day before ; I saw the
</p>
<p>uniform made up in the tailor's shop where I happened to go on
</p>
<p>some business ; I never saw them in that uniform before ; I heard a
</p>
<p>man say, " keep the step," and another, " keep the ranks ;" they did
</p>
<p>not keep the step, and I do not think they knew how to do it ; I
</p>
<p>went from that to Dunsany and from that to Tara; I walked over to
</p>
<p>the hill ; I heard there were twenty-one bands there ; Mr. Walker
</p>
<p>was there in coloured clothes ; He came up with me from Trim ;
</p>
<p>there was no policeman in uniform there ; Major Westenra was with
</p>
<p>me the whole time ; he came from Trim for curiosity ; I have seen
</p>
<p>the Hon. and Rev. Mr. Taylor ; I did not see him there ; there
</p>
<p>were many respectable looking carriages ; there were several ladies ;
</p>
<p>Major Westenra is not here, that I know of; he left the meeting
</p>
<p>k 2i8
</p>
<p>with me ; I never saw him since ; I never heard he was dead, and I
</p>
<p>therefore suppose he is alive.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell Was not the Shilmalier man humhugging you
</p>
<p>when he asked you if you would not take off your hat for Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell? I do not know, I told him I would not take off my hat.
</p>
<p>Then you are not particularly fond of Mr. O'Connell ? I have
</p>
<p>nothing to do with Mr. O'Connell.
</p>
<p>Now I will ask you a serious question, and I do not care how you an-
</p>
<p>swer it, are you a Repealer ? I will answer you as seriously, I am not.
</p>
<p>I never heard the name of theWexford man. I do not know whether
</p>
<p>he was humhugging me or not, but if he was he met with the wrong man
</p>
<p>to humbug. I was surprised when he told me about the 2000 men com-
</p>
<p>ing from Shilmalier. I did not ask his name. I never was in Shilma-
</p>
<p>lier. I do not know the population of it, nor did I look for the popula-
</p>
<p>tion of it. I suppose it is forty miles from Tara. I did not know it was
</p>
<p>upwards of thirty miles. I cannot tell the distance. He did not say
</p>
<p>he came through Dublin, but he said he came through Kildare. He
</p>
<p>did not tell where the 2000 men slept. I do not know whether he
</p>
<p>spoke the truth. Very likely he did not. I have only his word for
</p>
<p>it. I believed it at the time, and I have no doubt that he brought a
</p>
<p>large body with him. Mr. Walker was close to me. Neither I nor
</p>
<p>Major Westenra grew pale when we heard it. The man spoke loud.
</p>
<p>He was near me on the ditch, and he did not make a secret of it. Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell was still speaking when the crowd began to go. There
</p>
<p>were two platforms. I do not know whether one of them was appro-
</p>
<p>priated to the ladies. My attention was not particularly drawn to
</p>
<p>that. There was no appearance of any disturbance, nor tendency to
</p>
<p>it. The people were walking and talking, and amusing themselves.
</p>
<p>I got on the ditch to see Mr. O'Connell. I did not look out for the
</p>
<p>Shilmalier boys. This interview took place as Mr. O'Connell's pro-
</p>
<p>cession was coming up. It was nearly one o'clock. I made a report
</p>
<p>of these proceedings. Mr. Walker was near me, and must have heard
</p>
<p>what took place. I did not understand that any Chartists were pre-
</p>
<p>sent. I saw in a paper that Chartists had been sent there to create

</p>
<p>disturbance. I did not hear Mr. O'Connell or his friends denounce
</p>
<p>Chartists at the meeting. I heard I was denounced myself, and I saw
</p>
<p>it in a paper. I was very glad to get rid of the man, and I did not
</p>
<p>get him watched. The ditch where I stood was very far from the
</p>
<p>platform ; several hundred yards from it. It might have been a
</p>
<p>quarter of an English mile. I know that the men in different coun-
</p>
<p>ties wear different friezes. I saw Meath, Westmeath, Kildare, and
</p>
<p>Cavan frieze there. The county Meath people know me very well.
</p>
<p>A number of people were there who knew me. Mr. Walker was on
</p>
<p>my right, and the man was on my left hand. There were no persons
</p>
<p>whom I knew there.
</p>

</p>
<p>I am a Constable. I was at a meeting at Clifden. On Sunday, the
</p>
<p>15th of September ; it is in Connemara. I think at least between
</p>
<p>4,000 and 5,000 were there. I saw persons passing the barrack going
</p>
<p>269
</p>
<p>to the meeting. The barrack was a hundred yards from the place
</p>
<p>of meeting, which was on a flat field. There was elevated land near
</p>
<p>it. I first saw the Rev. Mr. M'Namara, Roman Catholic curate,
</p>
<p>mounted on horseback, and a hundred persons behind him. They
</p>
<p>moved about four or five abreast. To the best of my recollection,
</p>
<p>I saw Repeal cards in their hats ; I saw them quite convenient to
</p>
<p>me. I heard people telling they were the Ballinakill Repeal cavalry.
</p>
<p>At the lowest calculation there were a hundred horsemen. There
</p>
<p>were a good many on foot. I saw Mr. Murray, a pawnbroker from
</p>
<p>Galway, there. He was in a gig, dressed in a green frock, made of
</p>
<p>calico or silk, and a large scarf of the same colour embroidered with
</p>
<p>gold. He wore a very large Repeal card. He had a green ribbon
</p>
<p>round his hat, which was a straw hat. About a hundred or more
</p>
<p>mounted, and three hundred or four hundred on foot, were following
</p>
<p>him. The footmen did not walk in order at this time. When the
</p>
<p>procession was going to the platform, they were walking in better
</p>
<p>order. They walked abreast, and more regularly. Those following
</p>
<p>Mr. Murray had Repeal cards in their hats. Murray's card was three
</p>
<p>times as large as the others. To the best of my recollection, there
</p>
<p>was a shamrock on it. It was green. I saw several parties of horse-
</p>
<p>men besides those, but I cannot tell who they were headed by.
</p>
<p>They groaned, and shouted for Repeal as they passed the barrack.
</p>
<p>I think there were 1000 mounted men there. Mr. M'Namara be-
</p>
<p>longs to Ballinakill parish. I did not hear Mr. O'Connell speak
</p>
<p>that day. I saw him in a carriage, Mr. Steele at the back of the
</p>
<p>carriage, and as the people shouted, Mr. O'Connell waved his cap.
</p>
<p>He was in front of the carriage, and Mr. Steele was in it.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fitzgibbon.
</p>
<p>I spoke of Thomas Murray, I know him well. He is a respectable
</p>
<p>man, and is considered wealthy. They were all Connemara horses
</p>
<p>the people rode, who followed Murray. Some of them carried dou-
</p>
<p>ble. Two men, and sometime a man and woman on others. Some
</p>
<p>of them had saddles or pillions. They were all Connemara people.
</p>
<p>They were all very quiet. I did not leave the door of the barracks.

</p>
<p>It was open. The police were walking in and out. Captain Ireland
</p>
<p>was in barrack, but did not keep to the barrack. His own house was
</p>
<p>between the place of meeting and the barrack. There were a great
</p>
<p>many women, children, and gorsoons, and a vast number of bare-
</p>
<p>footed people there. It was a countryman who told about the Bal-
</p>
<p>linakil cavalry. I did not know him. He was in a kind of a trot.
</p>
<p>They had no carbines nor weapons. He was walking. They had
</p>
<p>bridles. They had no bits. They had no carbines nor weapons of
</p>
<p>any description. I did not remark that any of them had suggawns
</p>
<p>I saw saddles' made of sedge. Those that were after those with
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Namara had all leather saddles.
</p>
<p>Re-examined by Mr. Bennett.
</p>
<p>All those who were with Mr. M'Namara had saddles. There
</p>
<p>were some with Mr. Murray who had saddles.

<p>WEDNESDAY, January 24th.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Burton was absent from indisposition.
</p>
<p>James Healy examined by the Attorney-General.
</p>
<p>I am a Sub-Constable in the Constabulary. 1 was at the meeting
</p>
<p>at Mullaghroast, which took place on the 1st of October. I went to
</p>
<p>the meeting early that day. I remained there during the day and
</p>
<p>part of the night. I am stationed at Cork, and I went from Cork
</p>
<p>there. I think there were about 250,000 at that meeting. I was on
</p>
<p>the central part of the field, and I was along the road when the pro-
</p>
<p>cession was coming up. The crowd which came before Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell came up in a very boisterous manner ; shouting, screeching, and
</p>
<p>driving all before them. Those that came with him were very regu-
</p>
<p>lar. Those that were hurraing and screeching arrived, I think, from
</p>
<p>Carlow and Kilkenny at an earlier hour than Mr. O'Connell. The
</p>
<p>people came from all directions. The principal part came through
</p>
<p>" the long avenue." I saw a number of bands ; I think about thirty.
</p>
<p>Some were dressed in uniform resembling the hussars and lancers. I
</p>
<p>saw several documents circulated amongst the people. I saw the docu-
</p>
<p>ment now handed to me. This document was purchased by another
</p>
<p>person. I bought a similar one myself. The price, I believe, is
</p>
<p>only a halfpenny, but I paid a penny for it. I should think several
</p>
<p>thousands of these were purchased by the crowd. I heard nothing
</p>
<p>said when they were purchased. I tore up the one I bought myself.
</p>
<p>A Sub-Inspector of Police purchased the other. His name is John Do-
</p>
<p>novan. I think the several thousand documents, of which I spoke, were
</p>
<p>the same as that which I bought. There were persons disposing of
</p>
<p>the documents from an early hour in the morning till nightfall. I
</p>
<p>saw Mr. O'Connell and Mr. Steele at the meeting. They arrived, I
</p>
<p>think, between two and three o'clock. I saw a great many persons
</p>
<p>with labels upon their hats, bearing the inscription " O'Connell's
</p>
<p>police." They had pieces of timber in their hands, five or six feet
</p>
<p>long. They were quite small, like wands. I saw flags and banners
</p>
<p>at the meeting. There was one with the words No Saxon Threats,
</p>
<p>No Irish Slaves, No Compromise but Repeal. These inscriptions

<p>were upon a flag belonging, I believe, to the Castlecomer colliers. I
</p>
<p>do not know whether they were the Castlecomer colliers, but I heard
</p>
<p>persons say they were, Upon another flag were the words, Border
</p>
<p>Men, greet O'Connell, Cead mille failtha. Upon several others were
</p>
<p>the words, Repeal, and We tread the Land that bore us. Near the
</p>
<p>platform was a banner with the words, The Queen, O'Connell, and
</p>
<p>Repeal. On another was the inscription, Ireland dragged at the
</p>
<p>Tail of another Nation. I observed one attached to a private car-
</p>
<p>riage with the words, Repeal and no Separation. On another, near
</p>
<p>the pavilion, were the words, Fixity of Tenure, the Farmer's Right.
</p>
<p>On another, Mullaghmast and its Martyrs  a Voice from the Grave.
</p>
<p>On another was a dog, with a harp and something which I cannot
</p>
<p>describe before it. T saw the words, No Saxon Butchery shall give
</p>
<p>271
</p>
<p>Blood-gouts fur a Repast ; the Dog is roused, tmd'Freachery expelled
</p>
<p>from Mullaghmast. I think the words God save the Queen, or The
</p>
<p>Queen, God bless her, were underneath. The platform was occupied
</p>
<p>about two hours, but the meeting did not then separate. Some re-
</p>
<p>mained until morning. I heard no observations amongst the people,
</p>
<p>except shouting for Repeal and old Ireland, and words to that effect.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Macdonagh.
</p>
<p>I heard no expressions amongst the crowd except those which I
</p>
<p>have mentioned. I went amongst the crowd very much that day in
</p>
<p>the discharge of my duty, and minutely examined what was going on.
</p>
<p>I listened attentively to every thing.
</p>
<p>You mingled with the groups of people ? Yes.
</p>
<p>And listened to what they were saying? Yes, to anything I
</p>
<p>could catch.
</p>
<p>And all you did catch was M Repeal and old Ireland," although
</p>
<p>you were there during the meeting, and from eight o'clock until the
</p>
<p>next morning? I was there from the evening before the meeting
</p>
<p>to eleven o'clock at night, after the meeting.
</p>
<p>I presume you were sent from Cork to the meeting because you
</p>
<p>were a stranger? I do not know ; it may have been the reason.
</p>
<p>Was it not a very peaceable assemblage ? Yes, so far as I have
</p>
<p>seen there was no riot or breach of the peace from morning until
</p>
<p>night ; all was very quiet in that respect.
</p>
<p>And you answer me in the affirmative that there was no riot
</p>
<p>throughout the day ? There was nothing except shouting for Repeal.
</p>
<p>When you told the Attorney-General that parties remained there
</p>
<p>that night, you meant, I presume, at the banquet ; they were enjoy-
</p>
<p>ing themselves in the tents, I presume? Yes.
</p>
<p>In peace and quiet? As far as I saw.
</p>
<p>Were not the bands which arrived from Carlow and Kilkennv,
</p>
<p>temperance bands? I think they were.
</p>
<p>You have come from the south of Ireland ; now have you seen
</p>
<p>any of the processions of Father Matthew ? Yes, a great many of them.
</p>
<p>And temperance bands were at those processions? Yes.

</p>
<p>How many bands have you seen at a time in his processions ? I
</p>
<p>have seen more bands than I saw at Mullaghmast.
</p>
<p>How many have you seen at a time? I have seen forty-five at a time.
</p>
<p>When did you see them ? On the day of the Cork temperance
</p>
<p>procession.
</p>
<p>How many thousand people were in that procession ? I cannot
</p>
<p>exactly say ; I should think about 300,000.
</p>
<p>Did the tempei'ance bands wear uniform ? Some did.
</p>
<p>Had they flags and banners? Some had; very small ones; I
</p>
<p>cannot call them flags.
</p>
<p>I presume there were inscriptions upon them ? Oh ! yes, all con-
</p>
<p>nected with the temperance movement, as I believe.
</p>
<p>I presume those processions are common in the south of Ireland ?
</p>
<p>Very common.
</p>
<p>How long have you been in the constabulary ? Twelve years.
</p>
<p>272
</p>
<p>Have the people improved in their habits in consequence of the
</p>
<p>temperance movement? Very much so j I think there is a great im-
</p>
<p>provement in point of drunkenness.
</p>
<p>Describe how the bands came from Carlow and Kilkenny ; I sup-
</p>
<p>pose they were in great joy ? They appeared to be very wild. They
</p>
<p>drove all before them. They were led by persons who appeared to
</p>
<p>station them in different parts of the field.
</p>
<p>Were you one of the persons who were driven before the people ?
</p>
<p>I got a little crushing.
</p>
<p>There was nothing bad in it though ? No.
</p>
<p>Did they injure anybody ? Not that I could learn, except knock-
</p>
<p>ing down a gingerbread stand. They were selling them for profit.
</p>
<p>They were not giving them for nothing amongst the people. There were
</p>
<p>many persons selling gingerbread, grog, coffee, and things of that
</p>
<p>description. I do not know any of the persons who were selling
</p>
<p>those things. I did not observe a single one of the ballads given for
</p>
<p>nothing. In large assemblages I have frequently seen persons hawk-
</p>
<p>ing about and selling ballads, and I suppose they took advantage of
</p>
<p>this large assemblage to do so. I saw the persons at the meeting every
</p>
<p>place where they could make sale of these ballads.
</p>
<p>Have you not even seen persons selling such ballads at the As-
</p>
<p>sizes, when the Judges were sitting in the Crown Court and in the
</p>
<p>Civil Court? I have seen persons going about at the Assizes singing
</p>
<p>ballads.
</p>
<p>Now, with respect to those men who had papers in their hats
</p>
<p>with " O'Connell's Police" on them, did not you see them preserving
</p>
<p>peace and good order at the meeting? I saw them exerting them-
</p>
<p>selves, but not in the way police would.
</p>
<p>Did not you see them keep the platform clear and preserve order ?
</p>
<p>I believe that was their intention. Heard instructions given to them
</p>
<p>by a person named Walsh, to keep order and quietness about the
</p>
<p>platform and pavilion. Some of them did not comply with that
</p>
<p>order. The wands I saw were peeled, smoothed, and slight. I will
</p>
<p>say that they were pieces of timber.

</p>
<p>Mr. Moore.  My Lords, I submit that the evidence of the last
</p>
<p>Witness, as regards the ballads, ought not to be received. His evi-
</p>
<p>dence, as I understand it, is this : " That there were persons selling,
</p>
<p>" and distributing ballads in the course of the meeting, that he him-
</p>
<p>" self purchased one, which he lost, but that he got the document he
</p>
<p>" produced from another policeman, who put a mark upon it." I do
</p>
<p>not know whether the Witness went the length of saying he saw the
</p>
<p>other policeman buy that document. It would be evidence I acknow-
</p>
<p>ledge, if he saw the other policeman buy it from the person who was
</p>
<p>selling it ; but seeing him mark a document which he did not see
</p>
<p>him buy at the meeting from the person selling it, that I apprehend
</p>
<p>is not admissible in evidence.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  That is not the entire of his evi-
</p>
<p>dence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Macdonagh  My Lords, I submit that upon the evidence
</p>
<p>given, this document is not receivable in evidence. A very great
</p>
<p>273
</p>
<p>latitude is to be allowed in cases of conspiracy, when it is clearly to
</p>
<p>be inferred that an act was to be done in furtherance of the common
</p>
<p>object of the conspirators ; but where it has been proved, that in
</p>
<p>this vast assemblage, persons hovered about, or mingled amongst
</p>
<p>groups of persons fur the purpose of selling ballads, as was the habitual
</p>
<p>custom in the country to take advantage of large assemblies for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of selling those ballads, and that those ballads were not distributed
</p>
<p>gratuitously, but sold for profit, just as any other thing at the meet-
</p>
<p>ing, it would be unjust in the highest degree to permit that species of
</p>
<p>evidence to be received against the traversers. Besides there was
</p>
<p>not the remotest proof given of any connexion between those persons
</p>
<p>speaking on the platform, the traversers, the Association, or any
</p>
<p>member of that body, and the persons distributing those ballads.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brown, the authorized printer of the Association, had been
</p>
<p>examined, and this document is not shown to have been printed by
</p>
<p>him. I admit Mr. O'Connell, or any other of the traversers, would
</p>
<p>be responsible for any thing done at the meeting in furtherance of
</p>
<p>their common purpose, with their knowledge ; but it is not every
</p>
<p>collateral declaration, even of conspirators, that can be made evidence.
</p>
<p>This is no part of the res gestce. Would it not be monstrous to hold,
</p>
<p>that if at one of Father Mathew's Temperance meetings, a ballad of
</p>
<p>this description was sold, that he should be held responsible for it ?
</p>
<p>If this were allowed, it would be in the power of any ill-designing
</p>
<p>person to convert a perfectly legal assembly into an illegal one.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General In the case of The King v. Hardy,
</p>
<p>24 State Trials, it was decided that the Court has a right to look
</p>
<p>into a document offered in evidence, with a view to its admissibility
</p>
<p>or not. Now how does the evidence stand before the Court ? You
</p>
<p>have it proved that Mr. O'Connell said he chose that place (the Rath
</p>
<p>of Mullaghmast) for an obvious reason, that they were on the pre-
</p>
<p>cise spot in which English treachery, and false Irish treachery too,
</p>
<p>consummated a massacre unequalled in crime in the history of the
</p>
<p>world, until the massacre of the Mamelukes by Mehemet Ali.
</p>
<p>It was necessary to have Turks to commit crime in order to be

</p>
<p>equal to the crime of the English ; no other people but the Turks
</p>
<p>were wicked enough, except the English. He said that was a fit
</p>
<p>place, in the open air, to assert their determination not to be des-
</p>
<p>troyed by treachery ; and that while he lived they never should.
</p>
<p>That the meeting was not held there by accident, but by design,
</p>
<p>and that where his voice was then raised, the yell of despair was once
</p>
<p>heard from the victims who had fallen beneath the swords of the
</p>
<p>Saxons, who delightedly ground their victims to death. That three
</p>
<p>hundred unarmed men were slaughtered in the merriment of the
</p>
<p>banquet, leaving their wives and children to drop useless tears over
</p>
<p>them. This is what was stated by Mr. O'Connell at that very
</p>
<p>meeting where he could not be heard by the 250,000 persons pre-
</p>
<p>sent. At that meeting there was the motto : No more shall Saxon
</p>
<p>Butchery give Blood-gout to the Repast, the Bog is roused, and Trea-
</p>
<p>chery expelled from Mullaghmast. You may understand from this the
</p>
<p>purpose I have in having this document read in evidence. It was
</p>
<p>2n
</p>
<p>274
</p>
<p>impossible that this language could be heard by so large a multitude ;
</p>
<p>and this document was circulated among those who could not hear
</p>
<p>what had been said. It is said it is not. admissible because it was
</p>
<p>sold ; but that is no reason that it should not be admitted as evidence
</p>
<p>to show the character of the meeting, and to show the concurrence
</p>
<p>of the parties in the object they had in view. Nothing couldbe more
</p>
<p>important than this, to show the view with which those persons were
</p>
<p>assembled together  to excite discontent and disaffection among
</p>
<p>them to the English. It will be for the jury to say how far the tra-
</p>
<p>versers were privy to, or connected with this document ; but I
</p>
<p>submit that the Court are entitled to look into it, for the purpose of
</p>
<p>seeing the object that the parties had in view.
</p>
<p>Mr. Monahan.  My Lords, on the part of Mr. John O'Connell,
</p>
<p>I submit that this document ought not be received in evidence. The
</p>
<p>Attorney-General has stated that he knows who the printer of that
</p>
<p>document was; but he has not produced him to show for what pur-
</p>
<p>pose, or for what object it was offered for sale. There is no evi-
</p>
<p>dence that it was exhibited in the presence of the traversers, or that
</p>
<p>they had any knowledge that it ever existed ; and it is clear, to
</p>
<p>make it evidence, it should be brought home to have been the
</p>
<p>act of the parties taking part in the proceedings of that meeting, or
</p>
<p>that it was done with their sanction or knowledge, or that they recog-
</p>
<p>nized or adopted it. I did not object to the placards being given in
</p>
<p>evidence, because they were openly and publicly exhibited at the
</p>
<p>meeting.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor- General.  My Lords, I submit that this should be
</p>
<p>received in evidence, leaving it open to the traversers to give an ex-
</p>
<p>planation of it if they can. It is admissible, as showing the character
</p>
<p>of the meeting, the transactions that took place, and, among others,
</p>
<p>the circulation of this paper, which bears upon the charge contained
</p>
<p>in the indictment ; that is, that the traversers entered into a
</p>
<p>conspiracy for the purpose of exciting animosity and ill-will amongst
</p>
<p>different classes of her Majesty's subjects. We have shown that this
</p>
<p>meeting was convened by the direction of some of the traversers,

</p>
<p>and this document is evidence to show the intention of that meeting. It
</p>
<p>is immaterial whether it was sold or not, it is part and parcel of the res
</p>
<p>gestce at that meeting, and shows its character. It is not necessary to
</p>
<p>show any authority emanating from the Association for the printing or
</p>
<p>publishing of the document ; if they call a meeting they are responsible
</p>
<p>for what takes place at that meeting ; but if necessary to prove an au-
</p>
<p>thority for its circulation, is there not prima facie evidence from the
</p>
<p>document, which is uncontradicted, for it bears upon it the professed
</p>
<p>object for which the meeting was convened. Here is a document cir-
</p>
<p>culated through a multitude of persons, consisting some of " O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell's Police," and a large number of them connected with the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, and is it to be believed that it did not come to the knowledge
</p>
<p>of the traversers, and that there is not prima facie evidence of that?
</p>
<p>But it is said we should have proved that this was printed by the autho-
</p>
<p>rity of the Association ; that was not necessary to prove, as this was
</p>
<p>given in evidence as part of the res gestce. If they had circulated
</p>
<p>275
</p>
<p>the Repeal cards, and the other document, which we were under
</p>
<p>the necessity of proving, then there would have been no necessity
</p>
<p>for that proof. If they can produce evidence capable of contradicting
</p>
<p>this they may do so. They are at liberty to give an account of where
</p>
<p>they came from, they can produce the printer who printed them ; but
</p>
<p>I submit that they are evidence, as part of the res gestcs, and it is for
</p>
<p>them to show that they were not authorized by the Association.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice  The Court are of opinion that this
</p>
<p>document ought to be admitted in evidence ; we do not say what the
</p>
<p>effect it may have as evidence, but we say it ought to be laid before
</p>
<p>the Jury, in order that it may form part of the consideration of that
</p>
<p>upon which they may have to give judgment. I think, without con-
</p>
<p>troverting what was said by Mr. Moore, that it is admissible. He
</p>
<p>does not adopt the same ground as Mr. Monahan did ; but it is only
</p>
<p>Mr. Monahan's argument that I have to take into consideration. He
</p>
<p>says, if it could be proved that this document was circulated with the
</p>
<p>consent, or as forming part of the object of those who called this
</p>
<p>meeting ; he could not deny but that it was admissible as evidence
</p>
<p>against them. Now, let us see how the case stands upon the evi-
</p>
<p>dence already before the Court, and then compare it with the prin-
</p>
<p>ciple, the existence of which he admits. No person will deny but
</p>
<p>that there is evidence at present before the Court and the Jury, of
</p>
<p>the existence of the Repeal Association, consisting of a body of per-
</p>
<p>sons, who assembled at different places, in very large numbers,
</p>
<p>causing publications to be printed for different purposes, consistent
</p>
<p>with their objects. It cannot be denied that they have been in the
</p>
<p>habit of calling those meetings in different places, and that those
</p>
<p>meetings were called upon the authority of the Association, of which
</p>
<p>the several traversers are members. Now, in furtherance of this
</p>
<p>common practice, some time before the meeting of Mullaghmast, it
</p>
<p>was deemed advisable by the Members of the Association, that
</p>
<p>a great provincial meeting for Leinster should be called on to
</p>
<p>assemble at Mullaghmast. That place was appointed as the scene
</p>
<p>of the meeting a considerable time before the day appointed

</p>
<p>for the meeting. For the purpose of having the place of meeting
</p>
<p>made public, instructions were given to the printer of the Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation to print a number of advertisements. A great number
</p>
<p>were printed and circulated, that placard printed on yellow paper
</p>
<p>being one of those, calling a meeting of the province of Leinster to
</p>
<p>assemble at Mullaghmast ; that was therefore the place intended by
</p>
<p>the Association at which the meeting should assemble, and the persons
</p>
<p>who were called on to assemble had this significant hint given them,
</p>
<p>by a memorandum at the bottom of this publication  " Remember
</p>
<p>Mullaghmast." Now, why was Mullaghmast brought to their re-
</p>
<p>membrance? Mr. O'Connell had stated why he, acting on behalf
</p>
<p>of the Association, chose that to be the place for assembling on this
</p>
<p>occasion. Upon the evidence it appears Mr. O'Connell attended
</p>
<p>the meeting, and explained fully why Mullaghmast had been chosen.
</p>
<p>He made two speeches, one in the morning, another in the evening
</p>
<p>at the banquet, and Mr. Barrett, who is also a member of this Asso-
</p>
<p>276
</p>
<p>ciation, was there and made a speech ; those two persons on three
</p>
<p>several occasions stated distinctly why Mullaghmast was chosen as
</p>
<p>the place of meeting. It was chosen deliberately, and a summons
</p>
<p>was issued beforehand, and they were called on to assemble. Now,
</p>
<p>what object had Mr. O'Connell in choosing Mullaghmast as the place
</p>
<p>of meeting but to bring to the remembrance, and perhaps to the feel-
</p>
<p>ings of the parties assembled, the scenes that had taken place there
</p>
<p>in former times. Whether that was likely to produce excitement he
</p>
<p>did not say, but one of the reasons given by Mr. O'Connell himself
</p>
<p>was, to bring to the recollection of the meeting the treachery and
</p>
<p>cruelty of the Saxon race, and the impossibility of dealing with them.
</p>
<p>The people, then, were invited to come to Mullaghmast, as to a pro-
</p>
<p>vincial meeting, and consequently a very great one, and that invitation
</p>
<p>was given to them expressly by the Association through Mr. Ray,
</p>
<p>their Secretary. And the placards were printed by Browne their
</p>
<p>printer, and circulated. Now, when Mr. O'Connell or the Associa-
</p>
<p>tion took upon themselves to collect together, by public advertise-
</p>
<p>ment, a number of persons, to the amount of 250,000, it requires
</p>
<p>some consideration to say whether that is not an illegal act ; but I
</p>
<p>will say this, whether it was so or not, that those who ventured to call
</p>
<p>together that meeting, must abide the consequences of their own act
</p>
<p>as to what was done, connected with that meeting. 250,000 persons
</p>
<p>obeyed that summons to " remember Mullaghmast," and the first
</p>
<p>thing that was done was, to hand about a paper purporting to be "A
</p>
<p>full and true account of the dreadful slaughter at Mullaghmast, on
</p>
<p>the bodies of 400 Roman Catholics," and this was presented by a
</p>
<p>number of persons in all parts of the field, and whether they were gi-
</p>
<p>ven there gratuitously, or they were called on to buy them, is not of
</p>
<p>much consequence. These being circulated through the field, it was
</p>
<p>almost a necessary consequence, that those who were assembled there
</p>
<p>would hear what had been done at Mullaghmast. Now, I cannot
</p>
<p>pass by the fact, that Mr. O'Connell and Mr. Barrett drew similar
</p>
<p>pictures in the several speeches made by them, to what is referred to
</p>
<p>in this document. They all concurred in saying that cruelty and

</p>
<p>treachery not to be endured had been inflicted, and expressed their
</p>
<p>determination never to trust British cruelty again. Now, that was
</p>
<p>the professed object of the meeting, and it was intimately connected
</p>
<p>with it, and it is impossible to call the attention of the Jury from the
</p>
<p>fact of those persons being called together ; and it is for them to say,
</p>
<p>whether this is unconnected with the matter. I have therefore not
</p>
<p>the slightest reason for thinking that this document is not admissi-
</p>
<p>ble in evidence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton  In my opinion this document is clearly
</p>
<p>admissible in evidence. I shall assign my reasons for arriving at
</p>
<p>that opinion :  This paper is admitted to be one of importance;
</p>
<p>but without going into the nature or character of it, it appears to
</p>
<p>me that it cannot be rejected. With regard to the first objection,
</p>
<p>we must recollect that one of the overt acts set forth in the indict-
</p>
<p>ment is the meeting at Mullaghmast ; the character therefore of that
</p>
<p>meeting, and the nature of it, the object, and the acts of the parties
</p>
<p>277
</p>
<p>become very material, with a view to the charge in the indictment,
</p>
<p>which I shall not enter into. The acts of the parties forming those
</p>
<p>assemblies become of importance, because prima facie the acts and
</p>
<p>declarations of every one who attends a meeting, and who takes an
</p>
<p>ostensible part in it, and forms part of the assembly, become the
</p>
<p>acts and declarations of all the others, though they may disconnect
</p>
<p>themselves from them by evidence. Thus, the act of any one, though
</p>
<p>in a different part of the field, though it might be a quarter of a mile
</p>
<p>off, may be given in evidence against persons on the platform. Now
</p>
<p>what are the facts? Here is a meeting assembled for the purpose of
</p>
<p>a discussion of a particular kind ; here is a paper distributed by
</p>
<p>thousands, which upon the face of it has reference to this particular
</p>
<p>place of meeting. Now, suppose it appeared that some person, even in a
</p>
<p>different part of the field, at a considerable distance from the platform,
</p>
<p>read this paper aloud to the people, would any person say then that it
</p>
<p>should not be read in evidence? certainly it would be read in evidence.
</p>
<p>Suppose further, that it was circulated generally through the meet-
</p>
<p>ing, no person will contend that it should not be received in evidence
</p>
<p>against those speaking at the meeting. Then what is the difference ?
</p>
<p>This is not an isolated fact, for it was circulated by many persons.
</p>
<p>If circulated without being sold, no lawyer could contend that it was
</p>
<p>not evidence, for those persons attending there were all prima facie
</p>
<p>members of the meeting. Well, but is said, there was a sale. I
</p>
<p>think it would be rather a dangerous doctrine to hold, that seditious
</p>
<p>papers should be separated from the meeting, merely because it was
</p>
<p>not circulated gratis. The fact of sale cannot make a difference in
</p>
<p>this respect. Reasoning on general principles, that can make no
</p>
<p>difference. If from the evidence I could draw the conclusion that
</p>
<p>the vendor was unconnected with the meeting, and on his own ac-
</p>
<p>count took advantage of this large assemblage, for a purpose of a dif-
</p>
<p>ferent kind, I will not say then that it should be admitted as evi-
</p>
<p>dence ; but the persons who sold them were prima facie members of
</p>
<p>the meeting, and prima facie the others were bound by their acts. I
</p>
<p>think it of importance that this paper should be laid before the Court,

<p>with a view of ascertaining the intention of the purchasers, who were
</p>
<p>a portion of the assembly, and whose acts, therefore, were the acts of
</p>
<p>the whole assembly ; and therefore, I am of opinion that this should
</p>
<p>be received in evidence, and that the objection is untenable. There
</p>
<p>is another objection made by the counsel for the traversers, that if
</p>
<p>only two or three of these papers had been sold, this could not be
</p>
<p>admitted in evidence. The evidence is a sufficient answer to that
</p>
<p>objection, for it appears that these papers were sold in thousands.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin  I am of opinion that this document is
</p>
<p>clearly evidence to show the character of the meeting. Evidence
</p>
<p>has been given with respect to several meetings, to show what the
</p>
<p>conduct and character of those meetings were, and the declarations
</p>
<p>of the persons assembled. Here we have it in evidence, that from
</p>
<p>morning to night several persons were engaged in circulating and
</p>
<p>crying those documents, in different parts of the field ; that is pub-
</p>
<p>licly circulating them, and no person interfered to prevent them. I
</p>
<p>278
</p>
<p>do not say what the effect of this evidence may he. I do not say
</p>
<p>that it is connected with the Association ; that is for the Jury to de-
</p>
<p>cide upon.
</p>
<p>The Deputy Clerk of the Crown then read the following document :
</p>
<p>" The full and true Account of the dreadful Slaughter and Murder.
</p>
<p>" The fate of those murdered martyrs is calculated to brace
</p>
<p>" the sinews, and rouse in rhe mind of every Irishman a spirit of
</p>
<p>" desperation ; their blood cries yet to Heaven for vengeance. The
</p>
<p>" day may not-  we trust will not come, brought about, as it must
</p>
<p>" be, by British aggression, when that cry will be heard ; but if it
</p>
<p>" should, wo be to the conquered. That our readers may know be-
</p>
<p>" forehand the circumstances under which that black deed in the
</p>
<p>" annals of British crime, the slaughter at Mullaghmast, was perpe-
</p>
<p>" trated, we publish the following account of it, extracted from
</p>
<p>" Taaffe's History of Ireland. His account may give some perhaps
</p>
<p>" a higher gusto for attending the meeting. After alluding to the acts
</p>
<p>" of grace with which the reign of Philip and Mary commenced, such
</p>
<p>" as the restoration of the house of Kildare, the creating of Charles
</p>
<p>" Kavanagh a Baron, and the liberation from prison, where he had long
</p>
<p>" time been, of O'Connor of O'Faly, Taaffe, who, as well as Leland,
</p>
<p>" attributes these acts to a desire on the part of Philip and Mary to
</p>
<p>" re-establish the ancient religion, not to any love they entertained
</p>
<p>" for Ireland, goes on to say : ' However, a crime horrible to relate,
</p>
<p>" < which makes humanity shudder, effaces all the merits of this reign,
</p>
<p>" ' and is not exceeded by the foulest acts in the records of human
</p>
<p>" ' depravity. The ancient inhabitants of Leix and O'Faly, ever
</p>
<p>" ' since the English settlement here, had to guard against the
</p>
<p>" ' English encroachments. Their wars with the English in de-

<p> ' fence of their patrimony were frequent, only suspended occa-
</p>
<p>"'sionally by a peace in name, but a truce in fact. Sometimes
</p>
<p>" ' ejected, they often retook possession at the point of the sword.
</p>

</p>
<p>" ' horse and foot, who on a given signal, fell on those unarmed, de-
</p>
<p>279

<p>"  fenceless gentlemen, and murdered them all on the spot. Ah !

</p>
<p>"  thus glutted with the noble blood of the magnanimous, the pious,
</p>
<p>" ' the hospitable, the brave, were let loose like blood-hounds on the
</p>
<p>" ' multitude, dispersed in their villages, now without counsel, union,

</p>
<p>" ' pie over the whole extent of what is now called the King and
</p>
<p>" < Queen's Counties, without regarding either age or sex.'
</p>
<p>" The details of the diabolical outrages committed in those large
</p>
<p>" and populous districts would make hell blush to be outdone by
</p>
<p>" devils in human shape. I leave the reader to surmise the scenes of
</p>
<p>" horror that ensued when the whole population of an extensive ter-
</p>
<p>" ritory was consigned to military execution. A few brave men here
</p>
<p>" and there sold their lives as dearly as they could. What conflagration
</p>
<p>" of villages and unfortunate victims rushing from the flames on the
</p>
<p>** spears of their murderers ! What shrieks and lamentations of
</p>
<p>" women and children ! A brutal soldiery, drunk with blood and
</p>
<p>" the contents of the cellar, raging with fire and sword through the
</p>
<p>" country, cutting down men, women and children with indiscrimi-
</p>
<p>" nate slaughter  children massacred before their affrighted parents,
</p>
<p>" reserved for their greater torture to die a double death ; the first in
</p>
<p>w witnessing the massacre of their innocents, and then being cut dowu
</p>
<p>" themselves. The contemplation is horrible.
</p>
<p>" Leland passes over most of these infernal deeds. Plowden
</p>
<p>" omits them altogether; but though the former, the historian of the
</p>
<p>" Pale, speaks not of the enormous perfidy by which these gallant
</p>
<p>" clans, the O'Moores and the O'Connors, were circumvented, he
</p>
<p>" does not entirely conceal the inhuman barbarity with which their
</p>

</p>
<p>" ' extirpated had not the Earls of Kildare and Orinond interceded
</p>
<p>" ' with the Queen, and become sureties for the peaceable behaviour
</p>
<p>" 'of some survivors.' Taaffe, in speaking of this catastrophe, says
</p>
<p>" that the annals of Donegal, from which Leland copied, misdate it,
</p>
<p>" confounding it with a similar perfidy practised towards the Butlers,
</p>
<p>" near Kilkenny, in the reign of Elizabeth. ' Had not,' he says,
</p>
<p>" ' the warlike tribes of the O'Moores and O'Conners been circum-
</p>
<p>" ' vented by treachery, their lands could not have been seized upon
</p>
<p>" ' without a sanguinary war, nor have been bestowed on adven-
</p>
<p>" ' turers, and converted into shire ground  the King and the Queen's
</p>
<p>" ' County, which he proves they were  in the reign of Queen Mary.'
</p>
<p>" The Act of Parliament by which this robbery was perpetrated, bears
</p>
<p>" date 1556, not three hundred years ago ; and as this barbarous mas-
</p>
<p>" sacre must have taken place before the passing of that Act, no doubt
</p>
<p>" is left about the reign in which it occurred. The preamble of the
</p>
<p>280
</p>
<p>" Act itself is quoted by Taaffe at length, and the name3 of the
</p>
<p>" counties and county towns substituted for the ancient names of
</p>
<p>" Leix and O'Faly, viz., King's County, Queen's County, Philips-
</p>
<p>" town, and Maryborough, mentioned by him as collateral proofs that
</p>
<p>" the massacre at Mullaghmast, and the converting of the territories
</p>
<p>" of the O'Moores and O'Conners into shires or counties must have
</p>
<p>" taken place in the reign of Philip and Mary.
</p>
<p>" We allude to these particulars about the dates, because Curry
</p>
<p>" and others have fallen into the same error with regard to it, as
</p>
<p>" Leland, and because we are anxious to show Irishmen of every
</p>
<p>" class that the antipathy exhibited by England to Ireland is more a
</p>
<p>" national than a religions one  fully as much treachery, fully as
</p>
<p>" much cruelty, fully as much barbarity having been practsed by Ca-
</p>
<p>" tholic England; in proportion to her ability, towards Catholic Ire-
</p>
<p>" land, as there has in subsequent years been perpetrated by Pro-
</p>
<p>" testant England ; Teutonics and Celts, the races of the two countries,
</p>
<p>" are different, like acids they will not amalgamate, nor cannot meet
</p>
<p>" without one neutralizing the other. For this reason, as well as
</p>
<p>" numberless others, it is necessary that the Parliament of the two
</p>
<p>" countries should be separate, and the inhabitants of each be brought
</p>
<p>' as little into collision with the others as possible. From first to
</p>
<p>" last the Caucassian lords, from whom the Saxons are descended,
</p>
<p>" that rushed on Europe, and, as if hell had broken loose, for years
</p>
<p>" barbarously desolated it, were a predatory race, bloody of mind,
</p>
<p>" treacherous of disposition, and savage in their propensities  pos-
</p>
<p>" sessing little of the refinement, and scarcely any taste for arts that
</p>
<p>" distinguished people of eastern origin  a taste that spreads such a

<p>" The descendants of this race, like animals of the different species,
</p>

</p>
<p>" either the one or the other  either England, or the tiger  will not,
</p>
<p>" like the unfortunate people of Mullaghmast, trust to their cle-
</p>
<p>" mency or mercy ; but be prepared with the hard hand and iron
</p>
<p>" heel to meet, strike down, tread upon, and subdue their butchering
</p>
<p>" appetite. To drop the simile, however, and come to England
</p>
<p>" herself: What disposition has she always displayed ? Can her
</p>
<p>" rapacity be stayed by anything but fear ? Did she not always
</p>
<p>" murder those who sued to her for mercy, and basely betrayed
</p>
<p>" those who confided in her honor ? Is her nature changed ?
</p>
<p>" No : consistent in villany, she is doing now in India what she for-
</p>
<p>" merly perpetrated in this country ; and may she not do the same
</p>
<p>" here again, if Irishmen be cowardly or foolish enough to give her
</p>
<p>" the opportunity ? Warned, at all events, they should be against
</p>
<p>" her treachery. A picture of the slaughter at Mullaghmast should
</p>
<p>" be hung up in every Irishman's room, to remind him of the bru-

<p>281
</p>

</p>
<p>The Attorney General.  I propose to read that part of her Ma-
</p>
<p>jesty's speech, delivered on the close of the last session of Parliament,
</p>
<p>which relates to Ireland.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore I object to this being given in evidence; I do
</p>
<p>not know upon what ground it can be offered.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General,  There have been several speeches
</p>
<p>proved, which were made by Mr. O'Connell, commenting on this
</p>
<p>speech ; and I apprehend a document so commented on, must be
</p>
<p>received in evidence.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  It must be received.
</p>
<p>The Officer then read that portion of the speech which referred
</p>
<p>to the agitation of the Repeal of the Union.
</p>
<p>James Irvine examined by Sergeant Warren.
</p>
<p>I reside in Liverpool, and am connected with the Constabulary
</p>
<p>there. I was there on the 13th of October last, and saw placards
</p>
<p>relating to Repeal posted on the walls there. I took one down, and
</p>
<p>now produce it. I saw several others of a similar nature also posted
</p>
<p>through Liverpool.
</p>
<p>The Witness was not cross-examined.
</p>
<p>Sergeant Warren said, this was a verbatim copy of the address
</p>
<p>to the British subjects, which was already read. It had Mr. Browne's
</p>
<p>name to it, as printer, and would be read again, if necessary.
</p>
<p>The Court thought it unnecessary.
</p>
<p>Charles Vernon sworn, and examined by Mr. Smyly.
</p>
<p>I hold the office of Registrar of Newspapers in the Stamp Depart-
</p>
<p>ment. The declarations made by the publishers and proprietors of
</p>
<p>newspapers are made in my office, and the newspapers are also lodged
</p>
<p>there as they are published. I have here the declarations lodged
</p>
<p>by Mr. Barrett, proprietor, printer, and publisher of the Pilot. I

<p>have seen him subscribe that document. This declaration was

<p>lodged in my office. It is that of the proprietor of the Nation, by
</p>
<p>Mr. Charles Gavan Duffy. I am not acquainted with Mr. Duffy's
</p>
<p>handwriting. The proprietors of the Freeman's Journal are George
</p>
<p>Atkinson and John Gray, M.D., and Edward Duffy is printer. I
</p>
<p>do not know the handwriting of Dr. Gray, but I do know Edward
</p>
<p>Duffy's, and saw him write that name. These are copies of the ori-
</p>
<p>ginal declarations ; they are certified by Mr. Cooper, who is the
</p>
<p>proper officer for that purpose. The declarations of Messrs. Barrett,
</p>
<p>Gray, E. Duffy, Atkinson, and Charles Gavan Duffy, are all cer-
</p>
<p>tified by Mr Cooper. I have with me copies lodged of the Pilot,
</p>
<p>Freemans Journal and Nation. I took them from the Stamp
</p>
<p>Office. I have the Nation of the 10th of June ; it purports to be
</p>
<p>signed by Charles Gavan Duffy. I assessed the duty upon it, and it
</p>
<p>has been paid.

<p>Mr. Smyly asked the Witness to read the leading article in the
</p>
<p>Nation of the 10th of June.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  I object to this paper being read until Mr. Duffy's
</p>
<p>handwriting has been proved. It should also appear on the face of
</p>
<p>the declaration, or be proved aliunde, that the person before whom
</p>
<p>it purports to be made had authority to take it, 2 Hayes' Cr. Law,
</p>
<p>565, Rex v. White, 3 Camp. 98. This is signed by Mr. Cooper, but
</p>
<p>it does not state who Mr. Cooper is.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General.  Mr. Cooper is here, and we will ex-
</p>
<p>amine him.
</p>
<p>Jonathan S. Cooper stvorn, and examined by Mr. Smyly.
</p>
<p>I am Comptroller and Accountant-General in the Stamp Depart-
</p>
<p>ment for nearly twenty years; one of my duties is to take and
</p>
<p>subscribe the declarations of proprietors, printers, and publishers of
</p>
<p>newspapers; the declaration in my hand was made before me on the
</p>
<p>18th of November, 1842, by Mr. Charles Gavan Duffy, as proprietor
</p>
<p>of the Nation; I saw him sign it, as also the declarations made
</p>
<p>and subscribed by George Atkinson and John Gray (as proprietors),
</p>
<p>and Edward Duffy (printer) of the Freeman's Journal, on the 18th
</p>
<p>of February, 1841 ; as also the declaration of Mr. Barrett (proprietor
</p>
<p>of the Pilot), on the 8th of December, 1837.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Whiteside on Behalf of Mr. Duffy.
</p>
<p>I am authorized by commission to act as Comptroller ; I have
</p>
<p>not my commission here, it is at home: the date (18th November,
</p>
<p>1842) in Mr. Duffy's declaration is correct.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  Pray do you know Mr. Duffy?
</p>
<p>Witness I cannot say I do.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside This is not sufficient, they must go farther.
</p>
<p>There is no proof identifying Mr. Duffy, the traverser, as the pro-
</p>
<p>prietor of this newspaper ; they must produce some person who
</p>
<p>knows him. In criminal cases the evidence should be very distinct.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General  The 6& 7 Will. IV.c. 76, s. 6, provides
</p>
<p>that no newspaper shall be printed until this declaration has been
</p>
<p>made, and there is a heavy penalty on any person publishing a news-

</p>
<p>paper knowingly making a false declaration at the Stamp Office, and
</p>
<p>the 8th section provides that a certified copy of this declaration shall
</p>
<p>be conclusive evidence of the facts therein. The question then for
</p>
<p>the consideration of the Court is, whether this declaration so signed
</p>
<p>by the party as the publisher and proprietor of this paper, and pro-
</p>
<p>duced by the proper officer, is not sufficient prima facie evidence
</p>
<p>that it has been published by Mr. Duffy.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster In the case of Morgan v. Fletcher, 9 B. & C.
</p>
<p>382, the production of the certificate lodged at the Stamp Office,
</p>
<p>and an attested copy of the paper were held sufficient evidence of
</p>
<p>proprietorship, and the same was decided in The King v. Hunt,
</p>
<p>31 State Trials, 375.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  I have it upon my notes that the
</p>
<p>traverser, Mr. Duffy, is the proprietor of the Nation.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside.  There is no legal evidence of it.
</p>
<p>283
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  Suppose there were two traversers of
</p>
<p>the same name on trial for the same offence, and evidence like the
</p>
<p>present was brought forward, which of the two is the person conclu-
</p>
<p>sively bound by the Act of Parliament ?
</p>
<p>The Solicitor- General.  Prima Jhcie,it is evidence against either
</p>
<p>of them.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  If it be evidence against either, you
</p>
<p>might have two men convicted on two indictments upon the same
</p>
<p>paper, on which it was alleged only one was the proprietor. In my
</p>
<p>opinion, something in addition to the statutable evidence is required,
</p>
<p>but very slight evidence is sufficient. For my own part, I feel no
</p>
<p>difficulty, in point of fact, for I find Mr. Duffy described by a wit-
</p>
<p>ness who was very closely cross-examined, as the Editor of the
</p>
<p>Nation.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General.  I think it would be a bad precedent,
</p>
<p>where a Statute makes a certain thing evidence, that the Court should
</p>
<p>go beyond the Act. The words of the Statute are : " that this shall
</p>
<p>be as good evidence as if the handwriting had been proved."
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  I am not satisfied that the Crown
</p>
<p>has shown sufficient evidence of identity. I think that the proof at
</p>
<p>present is imperfect. The Act requires that Mr. Duffy should sign
</p>
<p>a declaration. The original declaration would certainly be evidence
</p>
<p>against the person who had signed the declaration as proprietor, and
</p>
<p>who had made a declaration at the Stamp Office. But in order to
</p>
<p>prevent any difficulty arising at the Stamp Office, the eighth section
</p>
<p>contains a further provision, furnishing a different species of evidence
</p>
<p>to be given against the party; a species of secondary evidence is this
</p>
<p>certificate, signed by the authorized officer, and if that officer had
</p>
<p>given evidence that he knew the person who signed, all would have
</p>
<p>been right.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General  I do not feel bound to give further
</p>
<p>evidence, unless the Court shall so direct.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin.  That is rather inconsistent with the
</p>
<p>course you have taken. You proved Mr. Barrett's handwriting by

<p>the first witness, and have produced Mr. Cooper to prove Mr.
</p>
<p>Duffy's handwriting, and having failed, you have had recourse to
</p>
<p>this certificate.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor General  Requiring such evidence would render
</p>
<p>the Act nugatory, because if it is necessary to prove the handwriting to
</p>
<p>the original declaration, why direct that an attested copy of that de-
</p>
<p>claration should be evidence ? What the Act intended was to do
</p>
<p>away with, and guard against the difficulty of proof arising from the
</p>
<p>circumstance that the person going before the public officer might be
</p>
<p>unknown to him. It therefore makes this certificate evidence, and it
</p>
<p>would be contrary to the policy and intention of the Act to require
</p>
<p>such proof.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin.  In my opinion the case cited does not go
</p>
<p>to the point. The objection in that case was, that it was necessary
</p>
<p>to prove the actual publication of the libel by the defendant. For-
</p>
<p>merly you should prove the fact, as in that case ; and the Statute re-
</p>
<p>ferred to did away with the necessity for such proof. Mr. Justice
</p>
<p>284
</p>
<p>Bayley says : " If a paper corresponding with the paper described in
</p>
<p>" the affidavit is produced, the party producing it is to be in the same
</p>
<p>" situation as if he had proved that the paper had been bought at
</p>
<p>u the house, shop, or place of business of the defendant."
</p>
<p>The Attorney General.  I think the concluding portion of the
</p>
<p>section leaves the matter beyond doubt, for it provides : "In all pro-
</p>
<p>" ceedings, and upon all occasions whatsoever, a copy of any such de-
</p>
<p>" claration certified to be a true copy under the hand of one of the
</p>
<p>" Commissioners, or of any officer in whose possession the same shall
</p>
<p>" be, upon proof made that such certificate hath been signed with the
</p>
<p>" handwriting of a person described in or by such certificate as such
</p>
<p>" Commissioner or officer, and whom it shall not be necessary to prove
</p>
<p>" to be a Commissioner or officer, shall be received in evidence against
</p>
<p>" any and every person named in such declaration as a person making
</p>
<p>" or signing the same as sufficient proof of such declaration, and that
</p>
<p>" the same was duly signed and made according to this Act, and of
</p>
<p>" the contents thereof; and every such copy so produced and cer-
</p>
<p>" tified shall have the same effect, for the purposes of evidence against
</p>
<p>" any and every such person named therein as aforesaid, to all intents
</p>
<p>** whatsoever, as if the original declaration, of which the copy so pro-
</p>
<p>" duced and certified shall purport to be a copy, had been produced
</p>
<p>" in evidence, and been proved to have been duly signed and made
</p>
<p>" by the person appearing by such copy to have signed and made the
</p>
<p>" same as aforesaid."
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice  The Court is of opinion, that the
</p>
<p>evidence should be admitted.

</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin.  I know in Rex \. Perry, 2 Camp. 398,
</p>
<p>it was decided that a parly might use an advertisement in a diffe-
</p>
<p>rent part of a paper, but I do not know whether he was entitled to
</p>
<p>use it as the evidence of the prosecutor.
</p>
<p>The Attorney- General In 1 Phil. Evid. 340, cited by Mr.
</p>
<p>Henn, there is nothing to show that it was proposed to be read by
</p>
<p>the defendant, as part of the plaintiff's evidence, and in the next page
</p>
<p>the contrary is laid down. But even if a doubt did arise, it is only
</p>
<p>applicable where the plaintiff reads a document, which is qualified or
</p>
<p>referred to by some other document which may be calculated to give
</p>
<p>it a meaning. In that case it may perhaps be read, but what the
</p>
<p>traversers contend for is, that where there is a distinct paragraph to-
</p>
<p>tally disconnected from the other part, they are entitled to read it.
</p>
<p>There is no authority showing that, and in page 342 of the same book
</p>
<p>285
</p>
<p>this principle is laid down, that if a document contains matter connect-
</p>
<p>ed, and other matter entirely disconnected with the suhject,and a por-
</p>
<p>tion of it is read, that does not make every portion of it evidence ; here
</p>
<p>there is no connexion between the two articles. In Slurge v. Buchan-
</p>
<p>an, 10 A. & E. 159, it was held that, where a letter book which was
</p>
<p>produced by the defendant, on notice given him for that purpose by
</p>
<p>the plaintiff, and the plaintiff read certain letters in that book as evi-
</p>
<p>dence, the defendant had no right to read in his own behalf, other
</p>
<p>letters on the same subject, copied in the same book, but not re-
</p>
<p>ferred to in those read by the plaintiff.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon.  The question here is, whether having given
</p>
<p>notice in their bill of particulars, that they will use certain newspa-
</p>
<p>pers, and that they will make use of the contents, which must mean
</p>
<p>all the contents, as evidence, they are to be allowed to stop short
</p>
<p>and use only certain portions of them? These papers are produced
</p>
<p>in order to prove overt acts against the traversers as members of the
</p>
<p>Association, because Mr. Duffy, the proprietor, was a member of the
</p>
<p>Association. It is sought by these to show the objects of the Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation, and for that purpose they give certain portions in evidence,
</p>
<p>and yet seek to withhold from the Jury what would clearly and more
</p>
<p>plainly explain those objects. We are entitled to call upon them to
</p>
<p>read every thing that bears upon the subject matter in issue. It is
</p>
<p>like stopping a witness who has given only part of an answer and
</p>
<p>preventing him from giving the remainder. Here it is sought to give
</p>
<p>in evidence part of these documents, in order to make an impression
</p>
<p>on the Jury which we may find it difficult to obliterate. What I get
</p>
<p>from a witness on cross-examination is evidence for the party produ-
</p>
<p>cing him ; here the articles which we wish to read should be made
</p>
<p>part of their evidence. They should read the whole of the document
</p>
<p>and should not stop when they have read only what they think fa-
</p>
<p>vourable to themselves ; for the question is, what is the purport of the
</p>
<p>whole of this document ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Monahan The case cited by the Attorney General from
</p>
<p>10 Ad. & El., does not apply to the present case ; in that case a book

</p>
<p>was produced containing a series of letters, and one of the parties
</p>
<p>wished to give evidence of a letter written on a particular day, and
</p>
<p>the other party was not allowed to read letters written on a different
</p>
<p>day. Suppose Mr. Vernon brought a volume of newspapers, we
</p>
<p>should not be entitled to call on him to read them all, but we are en-
</p>
<p>titled to have the whole of a particular newspaper read.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  Where do you draw the limit? Is
</p>
<p>every thing in a newspaper to be evidence ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Monahan I say, that every thing regarding the subject-
</p>
<p>matter of the charge, every thing showing the object of the parties,
</p>
<p>is evidence. King v. Lambert and Perry, 2 Camp. 398.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor General  The question here is, whether the
</p>
<p>Crown having read from a newspaper the whole of an article, the
</p>
<p>traversers have a right to insist upon reading another part of that
</p>
<p>newspaper, upon a different subject-matter, namely, a publication of
</p>
<p>a speech appearing to have been made some days before the publica-
</p>
<p>286
</p>
<p>tion in question, and the argument is, that by the word " contents," in
</p>
<p>our bill of particulars, we are bound to read the entire newspaper.
</p>
<p>The word " contents" means what is pertinent, and relevant to the
</p>
<p>issue. If we read the entire of the article, that is sufficient, and can-
</p>
<p>not be called a garbled extract. The document is the article, and we
</p>
<p>have read the whole of it. In the case in 2 Camp, an advertisement
</p>
<p>was allowed to be read, because it was part of the same publication
</p>
<p>which bore upon, and qualified the sense and meaning of what had
</p>
<p>been read ; but it did not qualify the charge. If this article qualified
</p>
<p>the meaning of the article which we read, justice would require that
</p>
<p>it should be read too, but not so, if it merely qualifies the charge.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton  The question does not seem to be,
</p>
<p>whether it is to be read or not, but whether it is to be read as evi-
</p>
<p>dence for the Crown or for the traversers.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor General.  The reason why such evidence was ad-
</p>
<p>mitted in Rex v. Perry was, that it affected the character of the
</p>
<p>article which had been read. But the proposition here, is widely
</p>
<p>different. It is sought to read an article, which, though relevant to
</p>
<p>the issue, is not explanatory of the article which we have read. In
</p>
<p>Bait v. Howard, 3 Stark. 6, the entry was referrible to the charge,
</p>
<p>but it was refused, because it was not referrible to the former entry.
</p>
<p>Adey v. Bridges, 2 Stark. 189, was to the same effect. So was the
</p>
<p>case in 10 Ad. Sc Ellis, cited by the Attorney General.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice This case has been so much discus-
</p>
<p>sed that 1 shall be brief in giving my reasons for the decision I have
</p>
<p>come to. A newspaper was given in evidence for the purpose of hav-
</p>
<p>ing an article which was printed in that paper, entitled " The Morality
</p>
<p>of War," read. This article in itself is perfect and distinct, and the
</p>
<p>whole has been read by the Crown. On another occasion, after an
</p>
<p>interval of several days, and having no connexion with that article, a
</p>
<p>speech was made by one of the traversers, which happens to have been
</p>
<p>reported in another part of the same paper, apparently having no con-
</p>
<p>nexion and giving no qualification of the opinions published in the
</p>
<p>same newspaper upon the subject of " The Morality of War." Now,

</p>
<p>suppose the speech, instead of having been spoken by Mr. O'Connell,
</p>
<p>was spoken by Mr. Duffy on an isolated occasion, having no reference
</p>
<p>to the article ; could it be said that Mr. Duffy, having made that
</p>
<p>speech, would be entitled to have it read, if he were unable to show
</p>
<p>its connexion with the article on " The Morality of War." No case has
</p>
<p>been cited which would lead to that conclusion (so far as I can see), or
</p>
<p>to support the proposition now advanced on the part of the traversers ;
</p>
<p>and if called upon to decide, I should have great doubts whether the
</p>
<p>traversers, without the consent of the Crown, would have had a right
</p>
<p>to have had that distinct and independent publication read at all. It
</p>
<p>is quite a different publication, as different as if the speech had been
</p>
<p>made one day and the publication had taken place six days after-
</p>
<p>wards. Though both in the same newspaper, one is not an explana-
</p>
<p>tion or a qualification of the other ; however, the Crown have made
</p>
<p>no objection to the speech being read, therefore it is not necessary to
</p>
<p>decide whether, if an objection had been made, the Court would or
</p>
<p>287
</p>
<p>would not yield to it. It has been read, and the question now is by
</p>
<p>whom. We are of opinion, it must be considered as read by the
</p>
<p>traversers. I am not saying against the traversers, but whatever they
</p>
<p>read again during the trial, is their evidence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton I concur in the opinion which has
</p>
<p>been delivered by my Lord Chief Juslice. There are two ques-
</p>
<p>tions; first, whether Mr. Duffy has a right to have a second article,
</p>
<p>containing a report of a speech, read on his part ; secondly, whether,
</p>
<p>it having been read without objection, it is now to be considered as
</p>
<p>evidence on the part of the traversers or of the Crown. Now I do
</p>
<p>not think the cases cited bear exactly upon the matter before the
</p>
<p>Court. No doubt it is true where a conversation is deposed to by
</p>
<p>way of an admission on the part of a defendant or a traverser, he has
</p>
<p>a right to have the whole of the conversation given in evidence, that
</p>
<p>is, subject to this restriction, that it is relevant to the issue. An
</p>
<p>answer in Chancery may be considered as falling within the same
</p>
<p>rule. Where an answer is produced against a party as an admission,
</p>
<p>he is entitled to have the whole of it read, if it be relevant to the
</p>
<p>issue, and where an affidavit is read at Nisi Prius, the defendant is
</p>
<p>entitled to have the whole of it read, under the same restriction.
</p>
<p>Another principle is applicable to this case, and it is this, that
</p>
<p>nothing is to be received that is not relevant to the subject matter
</p>
<p>of inquiry. But there is a third principle bearing on this question,
</p>
<p>in which I own there is some difficulty ; but, as my Lord Chief
</p>
<p>Justice has properly observed, the Court are not called upon to
</p>
<p>decide on it, that is, whether, in a case like the present, if one para-
</p>
<p>graph in a paper be read as being seditious, or tending to sedition,
</p>
<p>another paragraph in the same paper entirely detached from it, and
</p>
<p>not explanatory of it, or modifying it, can be read. The general
</p>
<p>rule I always understood to be this ; if a piece of evidence com-
</p>
<p>plete in itself is put before the jury by one party, it cannot be
</p>
<p>affected by another piece of evidence of the same description,
</p>
<p>unless that other piece of evidence intends to explain and modify
</p>
<p>or qualify that which has been offered on the other side. In

</p>
<p>the King v. Lambert and Perry, Lord Ellenborough has laid it
</p>
<p>down, that, although in a newspaper, which is the subject of a prose-
</p>
<p>cution for libel, there be one article, and in the same paper there be
</p>
<p>a second article, which has no reference to, and is unconnected with,
</p>
<p>the former, yet there are cases in which the second article may be
</p>
<p>read. That decision, I suppose, is well-founded ; but that was a
</p>
<p>case in which a question arose as to the intention of the writer, to be
</p>
<p>deduced from the article, the subject matter of the prosecution. The
</p>
<p>second article might then be introduced for the purpose of aiding the
</p>
<p>jury in coming to a conclusion as to what were the intentions and mo-
</p>
<p>tives of the writer, in writing the article the subject of the prosecution.
</p>
<p>Supposing that doctrine to be well-founded, then arises the impor-
</p>
<p>tant question, and the only question upon which I mean to give an
</p>
<p>opinion  whose evidence is this ? The Crown say that it is not
</p>
<p>part of their evidence : my opinion is, that the traverser who has
</p>
<p>called for the reading of it, has thereby made it his own evidence.
</p>
<p>I will not sav that if the article had been also an editorial article
</p>
<p>288
</p>
<p>hearing upon the same suhject, or if, without being an editorial
</p>
<p>article, or without being written by the same party, it had been one
</p>
<p>from which there could be deduced anything like a test of the inten-
</p>
<p>tion of the party in writing the former article, that it might not be
</p>
<p>admissible in evidence. But the question is, if it is admitted in evi-
</p>
<p>dence, whose evidence is it ? In the King v. Perry, Lord Ellen-
</p>
<p>borough says : " If there be any parts of the same paper upon the
</p>
<p>" same topic with the libel, or fairly connected with it, the defen-
</p>
<p>" dants have a right to their being read, although locally disjoined
</p>
<p>" from it. But," he says, "the Courts have gone further, for they
</p>
<p>" have allowed the defendant to give in evidence various extracts from
</p>
<p>" works which he had published at a former period of his life." One
</p>
<p>would certainly infer that it was read as the defendant's evidence, for
</p>
<p>Lord Ellenborough puts it on the same ground as if it was a para-
</p>
<p>graph in another paper, and it cannot be contended that a paragraph
</p>
<p>taken from another paper could be read in cross-examination by the
</p>
<p>defendant as part of the plaintiff's evidence. I therefore take it, that
</p>
<p>in that case the article, though in the same newspaper, was read as
</p>
<p>part of the defendant's evidence. But another test has been sug-
</p>
<p>gested ; is this paragraph to be considered as part of the cross-exa-
</p>
<p>mination ? if so, then undoubtedly it comes within the rule that no
</p>
<p>part of the cross-examination is evidence of the party who cross-
</p>
<p>examines. The witness was called to prove only certain matters
</p>
<p>relating to this paper, the officer was the person who should have
</p>
<p>read, and the fact of the paper having been read by the witness
</p>
<p>does not give it the character of a cross-examination. The defen-
</p>
<p>dant proves a new document in the course of his cross-examination of
</p>
<p>the witness ; he chooses to have it read, and therefore it becomes
</p>
<p>part of his evidence, unless it refers to, or explains, or modifies, or
</p>
<p>qualifies that which has been read by the opposite party. It appears
</p>
<p>to me, that supposing this article to be admissible, which it is not
</p>
<p>necessary to decide, as the Crown have consented to its being read,
</p>
<p>that it is no part of the cross-examination, but part of the defend-
</p>
<p>ant's evidence ; he is entitled to the benefit of it, but he must take

</p>
<p>it as his own evidence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin The question appears to me simply
</p>
<p>this : A newspaper is given in evidence on the part of the prose-
</p>
<p>cution, from which an article is read for the purpose of showing
</p>
<p>that the traverser who published that paper entertained the intention
</p>
<p>and object of the conspiracy charged in the indictment. It was of-
</p>
<p>fered as evidence of such intention having been entertained by him.
</p>
<p>In no other point of view can that be looked on as evidence. That
</p>
<p>having been read by the Crown, the traverser's counsel calls upon the
</p>
<p>witness or the officer to read another part of the same publication, an
</p>
<p>article distinct from, and not referring to the former article, but which,
</p>
<p>he says, being published at the same time, and uno fiatu, and being
</p>
<p>indicative of a directly different intention, ought to be read to show
</p>
<p>he had not the same intention as that which had been inferred from the
</p>
<p>first article. It is offered as explanatory of and qualifying the article
</p>
<p>read by the Crown, and as part of the same publication, under the
</p>
<p>289
</p>
<p>authority of the King v. Perry. In the language of Lord Ellenbo-
</p>
<p>rough : "the passage alluded to will deserve more or less attention ac-
</p>
<p>" cording to its connexion with the subject matter of the libel."
</p>
<p>The whole question is for the jury whether the person who published
</p>
<p>these two articles in one paper entertained the intention charged. I
</p>
<p>do not think it necessary for the jury to consider whose evidence it is.
</p>
<p>It is given at the instance and desire of the traversers, for the purpose
</p>
<p>of protecting them from the inference which might be drawn from
</p>
<p>the article read by the Crown. The prosecutor reads what, as he
</p>
<p>conceives, sustains his case. He is not bound to read the whole of the
</p>
<p>paper. The traverser then calls for another part of thesame paper,which
</p>
<p>he conceives to be favourable to him, but it does not belong to anybody.
</p>
<p>According to the case of The King v. Perry, the article was very
</p>
<p>properly admitted in evidence. If the second article related to
</p>
<p>different subjects from the first, and had no possible reference to it,
</p>
<p>it would not be received, but it is not necessary that it should relate
</p>
<p>to the same particular matter as the first article, if it relates to the
</p>
<p>object with which that article was given in evidence. In the case of
</p>
<p>The King v. Perry, the first article was used to shew that Lambert
</p>
<p>and Perry, the defendants, had published a seditious libel with the
</p>
<p>intention of defaming King George the Third, and the second article
</p>
<p>was referred to, to show that they were not persons who could entertain
</p>
<p>those disloyal feelings, that being an article praising the king, and
</p>
<p>mentioning several circumstances highly creditable to him. It did
</p>
<p>not relate to the particular matter in the former article, but as the
</p>
<p>two articles were parts of the same publication, both were the subject
</p>
<p>matter for the consideration of a jury. In Home Tooke's case, and
</p>
<p>The King v. Stockdale, the same doctrine was established; but in
</p>
<p>that latter case there was this distinction, that all the passages were
</p>
<p>contained in the publication and part of the same book. I therefore
</p>
<p>think that this evidence is admissible, but I concur with the other
</p>
<p>members of the Court in thinking that it should form part of the
</p>
<p>evidence given for the traverser.
</p>
<p>The Officer then read for the Crown an article, entitled " The

</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside required that Mr. Sharman Crawford's letter in the
</p>
<p>same paper should be read.
</p>
<p>At the suggestion of the Court it was agreed, that for convenience

<p>each paper should be disposed of by both parties before another was

<p>produced. u

<p>THURSDAY, January 25th.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Burton was still absent.
</p>
<p>Mr. Vernon produced the Nation of the 12th of August.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Hagan, on the part of Mr. Duffy, required that the
</p>
<p>address to the people of Great Britain, signed by Mr. Smith
</p>
<p>O'Brien, and several other Irish Members should be read, and it
</p>
<p>was read by the Clerk of the Crown.
</p>

</p>
<p>The Nation of the 26th of August was produced, and the arti-
</p>
<p>cles " The Crisis is upon us," and " The Irish Congress," were read
</p>
<p>on behalf of the Crown.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Hagan required that the article headed " Superseding
</p>
<p>Magistrates," and containing a correspondence between Mr. Henry
</p>
<p>Sugden, and Mr. Valentine Blake, should be read.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General I do not think this document bears upon
</p>
<p>tbe article which we have read. I would not object, but that articles
</p>
<p>and letters have been read which have no reference to the docu-
</p>
<p>ments which have been read by the Crown. I wish, therefore, the
</p>
<p>ordinary course to be pursued. We wish to close the case for the
</p>
<p>Crown as soon as possible, by merely reading portions important for
</p>
<p>the prosecution, and when the Crown close their case, the traver-
</p>
<p>sers can offer such evidence as they consider bears on the issue.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell We thought we had the full acquiescence of the
</p>
<p>counsel for the Crown to read those documents, and it is now too
</p>
<p>late to take the objection. We understood that this course was to
</p>
<p>be adopted as a matter of convenience, and we have made our ar-
</p>
<p>rangements accordingly, and it would now embarrass us in the course
</p>
<p>we have adopted, if that arrangement is to be deviated from.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  We conceived that the arrange-
</p>
<p>ment which had been entered into at the time was, that it would be
</p>
<p>the most convenient way to get rid of one paper before another was
</p>
<p>produced. At the time that arrangement was made, it was not pro-
</p>
<p>bably anticipated that the reading of documents unconnected in their
</p>
<p>nature with the evidence which had been produced by the Crown
</p>
<p>would have been called for. I do not see there can be any embar-
</p>
<p>rassment by pursuing that arrangement, but it is to be hoped that
</p>
<p>counsel for the traversers will not take any unnecessary advantage
</p>
<p>of that arrangement.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton  No doubt the strict rule is with the
</p>
<p>Crown, at the same time it was suggested by the Court, and it
</p>
<p>was thought the most convenient course would be, to dispose of each
</p>
<p>paper in its order. I do not, nor will I anticipate that that sugges-

<p>tion will be abused by reading matters not relevant to the issue

</p>
<p>" MY BEAUTIFUL, MY OWN.
</p>
<p>" I have watched in delight the fire that flies
</p>
<p>In the lightning flash of thy dark blue eyes,
</p>
<p>As they sparkled in joyous merriment, caught
</p>
<p>From the passing jest to the brilliant thought 
</p>
<p>My beautiful, my own.
</p>
<p>" But I have seen a light in them dearer still,
</p>
<p>A softer, diviner radiance, fill
</p>
<p>Their sparkling orbs, was bliss to see :
</p>
<p>'Twas affection's light, and 'twas turned on me 
</p>
<p>My beautiful, my own.
</p>
<p>" In dread of thy frown, I vainly strove
</p>
<p>In silence to hide my heart's deep love :
</p>
<p>But my soul's felt passion thou didst not spurn,
</p>
<p>And at last even whispered of love's return 
</p>
<p>My beautiful, my own.
</p>
<p>" Oh, that moment's happiness was worth
</p>
<p>All other things on this broad earth :
</p>
<p>And I felt that thenceforward unto me
</p>
<p>My only heaven could be with thee 
</p>
<p>My beautiful, my own.
</p>
<p>" I've played with the curl of thy raven hair,
</p>
<p>And wish'd to be one of the tresses there :
</p>
<p>To touch for ever that rosy cheek,
</p>
<p>And catch each accent thy lips should speak 
</p>
<p>My beautiful, my own.
</p>
<p>" For in rapture almost too great I've hung

<p>On the low, sweet tones of thy gentle tongue,
</p>
<p>As they told of thy choice, which could not range,
</p>
<p>And thy love, which time could never change 
</p>
<p>My beautiful, my own.
</p>
<p>" Did the poet's mantle to me belong,
</p>
<p>I would hallow thy beauty in deathless song :
</p>
<p>In the minstrel's lay should thy name resound,
</p>
<p>And a halo of glory circle thee round 
</p>
<p>My beautiful, my own."

<p>O'Connell. I saw them both acting as Arbitrators. I saw Dr. Gray
</p>
<p>act but once as Arbitrator. I have seen Mr. John O'Connell seve-
</p>
<p>ral times. I first saw him on the 17th of October. I saw him several
</p>
<p>days subsequently acting as Arbitrator. There was one case the first
</p>
<p>day I attended the court, and there was no case on the subsequent
</p>
<p>days.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hatchell.
</p>
<p>I was not there on the commencement of the proceedings of the
</p>
<p>first day. I went there about a quarter past eleven. I went in and
</p>
<p>out once or twice, no obstruction was given to me, quite the reverse.
</p>
<p>There was the greatest kindness shown me. They stated they had
</p>
<p>no power to do anything except by consent of the parties. I saw no
</p>
<p>fees paid, no persons pleading. The parties wishing to have their
</p>
<p>differences settled did consent. There was nothing done in the
</p>
<p>case that was brought on, it was adjourned to Kingstown. I was
</p>
<p>294
</p>
<p>not present when it was finally decided. I did not see any case de-
</p>
<p>cided. I went there in uniform. I did not go there by the direction
</p>
<p>of the Arbitrators. I went there in performance of my duty as In-
</p>
<p>spector of Police. I did not go there as officer of the court. I gave
</p>
<p>no previous intimation that I would go there. I saw no oaths ad-
</p>
<p>ministered
</p>
<p>The Attorney General.  My Lords, we close on the part of the
</p>
<p>Crown.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore.  My Lords, Mr. Sheil, who is to open the case for the
</p>
<p>traversers, is unwell. We have sent to him, and he says that he is at
</p>
<p>present confined to bed by a slight attack, but that he will be able to
</p>
<p>attend tomorrow. The other counsel would be put to great diffi-
</p>
<p>culty if required to address the Court to-day. Perhaps your lord-
</p>
<p>ships will not think I am trespassing too much on the indulgence of
</p>
<p>the Court by requesting an adjournment until to-morrow.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  It is a very reasonable application.
</p>
<p>SATURDAY, January 27.
</p>
<p>Mr. Richard Lalor Sheil, Q.C
</p>
<p>My Lords, and Gentlemen of the Jury,
</p>
<p>I am counsel in this case for Mr. John O'Connell. It is so im-
</p>
<p>portant a case that I am sure you will agree with me in thinking,
</p>
<p>that I do not resort to exaggeration, and that 1 do not speak in the lan-
</p>
<p>guage of hyperbole, when I say that the attention of the empire is di-
</p>
<p>rected to the spot on which we are assembled. How sacred is the
</p>
<p>trust reposed by the laws of your country on you ! How great is the
</p>
<p>task which I have undertaken ! Conscious of its magnitude I rise to
</p>
<p>address you  not unmoved, but undismayed ; not unmoved, for at this
</p>
<p>moment how many of the incidents of my own political life inevitably
</p>
<p>recur to my recollection, when I look up to my great political leader,
</p>
<p>my deliverer, and my friend. But of the emotion by which I acknow-
</p>
<p>ledge myself to be profoundly stirred, solicitude forms no part. I
</p>
<p>have great reliance on you  in the ascendency of principle over pre-
</p>
<p>judice  the predominance of true religion over sectarian error  and,
</p>
<p>above all, in your regard for your oaths: but, while I have that re-

</p>
<p>liance on you, I am not quite destitute of confidence in myself.
</p>
<p>You will do me the justice, I am sure, to believe that I do not speak
</p>
<p>in the language of a vain-glorious self-confidence, when I say that I
</p>
<p>am well aware that I am encompassed by gentlemen infinitely my
</p>
<p>superiors in every forensic and every intellectual qualification. My
</p>
<p>confidence is grounded not on an overweening esteem of my own
</p>
<p>humble talents, but from a thorough conviction of the innocence of my
</p>
<p>client. I know that he is innocent ; and how do I know that he is
</p>
<p>innocent ? I appear before you not only as the advocate of the son,
</p>
<p>but in some sort as a witness. The father and the son are identical ;
</p>
<p>their principles are the same ; the same blood flows in their veins ;
</p>
<p>295
</p>
<p>the same feelings animate their hearts. I toiled with the father in
</p>
<p>companionship  humble, indeed, but not dishonourable  for upwards
</p>
<p>of twenty years of my life, in that great work which it is his chief
</p>
<p>boast, that in the spirit of peace it was conceived ; in the spirit of
</p>
<p>peace it was carried out; and in the spirit of peace it was brought to
</p>
<p>its glorious consummation. I am acquainted with his character, the
</p>
<p>temper of his mind, his habits, his feelings, his hopes, his fears, and
</p>
<p>his aspirations ; I have, if I may venture to say so, a sort of cognizance
</p>
<p>of every pulsation of his heart. Gentlemen, it is from this source that
</p>
<p>my confidence is derived ; I know that of the motives attributed to him
</p>
<p>by the Attorney-General he is incapable. It is this impression, tho-
</p>
<p>rough and impassioned, and 1 trust that it will prove contagious, which
</p>
<p>will sustain me in the execution of the arduous duties, physical and
</p>
<p>intellectual, incident on this great trial ; and will not only bear me
</p>
<p>up against the illness under which I am at this moment labouring,
</p>
<p>but will, I trust, raise me to the height of this great argument, lift me
</p>
<p>to a level with the lofty topics ofwhich I have to treat, in resisting
</p>
<p>a prosecution, to which no parallel in the annals of criminal juris-
</p>
<p>prudence can be found. Gentlemen of the Jury, the Attorney-Ge-
</p>
<p>neral, in his speech of very considerable duration, but the length of
</p>
<p>which was by no means disproportioned to the magnitude of the sub-
</p>
<p>ject, read to you a long series of diligently collected extracts from
</p>
<p>publications and speeches, spreading over a period of upwards of nine
</p>
<p>months. At the close of all these extracts, he expressed his asto-
</p>
<p>nishment that such language could be used in a country where social
</p>
<p>order is maintained. Gentlemen of the Jury, if the indignation of
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General was not artificial, if it was not an ex-officio in-
</p>
<p>dignation which he gave vent to, if he spoke to you with sincerity,
</p>
<p>how did it come to pass, and I am sure there is not one of you who
</p>
<p>did not put to himself this question  how did it come to pass that for
</p>
<p>a period of nine months not a single step was taken by him, or by
</p>
<p>the Government, for the purpose of arresting what was represented
</p>
<p>by him as a sore calamity ? The country, he said, was traversed by
</p>
<p>incendiaries, who set fire to the passions of the people. The whole

</p>
<p>fabric of the state was in a blaze. If so, how does it come to pass that
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General gazed, with folded arms, at the conflagration ?
</p>
<p>Why was it that the Castle fire-engine, why was it that an indict-
</p>
<p>ment, that an ex-officio information, was not resorted to? He has
</p>
<p>given no explanation. He has hinted at no explanation on this head.
</p>
<p>Is there not too much reason to conjecture that this expedient was
</p>
<p>resorted to by the Right Honourable Gentleman for the purpose of
</p>
<p>decoying and ensnaring the traversers into some indiscretion which
</p>
<p>might afterwards, and in due time, be turned to account. I heard
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General allude several times to the expression which
</p>
<p>occurred in some of the speeches which he read to you : " Bide your
</p>
<p>time." Is it befitting that the Government should bide their time, in
</p>
<p>order to turn the popular excitement to a useful official account? The
</p>
<p>public prosecutor, who gives a connivance almost equivalent to a sanc-
</p>
<p>tion, and who incites to an indiscretion of which he may afterwards
</p>
<p>296
</p>
<p>take advantage, appears to bear some sort of moral affinity to the de-
</p>
<p>lator, who provokes to the commission of the crime, from the denun-
</p>
<p>ciation of which, his ignominious sustainment is derived. Is it befit-
</p>
<p>ting the head of his Profession, the representative of its intellect in the
</p>
<p>House of Commons ; is it befitting the man who holds the office that
</p>
<p>was held by Saurin and by Plunket, who should keepwatch and ward
</p>
<p>from his high station for the public safety ; is it befitting that he
</p>
<p>should descend to the performance of functions worthy only of a com-
</p>
<p>missary of the French police; that, instead of being the sentinel, he
</p>
<p>should stoop to be the " artful dodger" of the State? What can be
</p>
<p>the motive ? for what purpose ? The Solicitor-General will tell you
</p>
<p>it was forbearance on the part of the Government. I tell you the
</p>
<p>motive was twofold. If, when a seditious publication, or a publica-
</p>
<p>tion alleged to be seditious, appeared, a prosecution had been imme-
</p>
<p>diately instituted against Mr. Duffy, he might have been caught.
</p>
<p>If, when another publication appeared in the Pilot, a prosecution had
</p>
<p>been instituted against Mr. Barrett, he might have been caught. And
</p>
<p>then Dr. Gray might have been caught. And, perhaps, Mr. Steele
</p>
<p>might have been indicted for some speech. But what great party pur-
</p>
<p>pose would then have been obtained ? None. If I may venture to draw
</p>
<p>an illustration from the habits of my constituents at Dungarvan, the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General did not fish with a line, but he cast into deep water
</p>
<p>a nicely constructed trammelling net, in order that he might draw in
</p>
<p>the great Agitator, the leviathan himself, the member for Kilkenny,
</p>
<p>three editors of newspapers, and a pair of priests, at one single stu-
</p>
<p>pendous haul. There was another motive. If he had indicted Bar-
</p>
<p>rett, for what Barrett wrote, that would have been no charge against
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell. If he had indicted Duffy, for what Duffy wrote, that

<p>would have been no charge against Mr. O'Connell. If he had insti-
</p>
<p>tuted a prosecution for libel or for seditious speeches, the party who
</p>
<p>wrote the libel, or who spoke the speeches, would have been alone
</p>
<p>responsible. But by proceeding for a conspiracy, which has all the
</p>
<p>advantages of the old doctrine of constructive treason, they could use
</p>
<p>the acts of one against another. It is a maxim of our law, a general

</p>
<p>maxim of our law, that what is said by one man, or what is done by
</p>
<p>one man, shall, in ordinary cases, not be brought in evidence against
</p>
<p>another; the exception is in cases of conspiracy. In cases of conspi-
</p>
<p>racy, what is done by A. at a distance of a hundred miles, may be
</p>
<p>given in evidence against B., although he never heard it. That, I
</p>
<p>may be permitted to say, Gentlemen of the Jury, is the law ; and now
</p>
<p>we find the motive for not prosecuting the editors of the newspapers.
</p>
<p>They were joined in the indictment for conspiracy, in order that their
</p>
<p>publications might be given in evidence against Mr. O'Connell. Now,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, you can account for some of the strange circumstances
</p>
<p>connected with Mr. Bond Hughes. He arrives in Dublin with a
</p>
<p>letter to the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General not being at
</p>
<p>home, he goes to a man who is at least equivalent to the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General. We find Bond Hughes and Mr. Brewster together. No one
</p>
<p>ventures to ask Bond Hughes what happened between him and Brews-
</p>
<p>297
</p>
<p>ter, and I leave it[so. As Mr. O'Connell might have said, at one of
</p>
<p>those meetings to which the Attorney-General has referred, in speak-
</p>
<p>ing of the " dark-eyed" girls of Kildare, " something must be left for
</p>
<p>the imagination." I will not break the gauze under which Brewster
</p>
<p>and Bond Hughes must be left together. Bond Hughes goes to
</p>
<p>Mullaghmast. He comes from it, and he makes an affidavit. What
</p>
<p>does he state ? He states he saw Barrett at two meetings in Dublin ;
</p>
<p>he swears he saw him only three times, once at Mullaghmast, and
</p>
<p>twice in Dublin  I think on the 9th of October. Bond Hughes
</p>
<p>swears to the meeting ; Bond Hughes swears to the speeches ; Bond
</p>
<p>Hughes swears to the fact of the presence of Barrett at the meeting.
</p>
<p>Bond Hughes afterwards sees Barrett at Judge Burton's house ;
</p>
<p>he) says, "Oh! I was mistaken; this is not the gentleman I took
</p>
<p>for Barrett." He goes to Mr. Rae, Mr. Kemmis's clerk, and says,
</p>
<p>" I am afraid I have made a great mistake ; I have made an affi-
</p>
<p>davit which was the ground of a warrant from a judge of the
</p>
<p>Queen's Bench against Mr. Barrett ; I have stated what is not
</p>
<p>the fact, and I wish to correct my statement." " Oh, it is done
</p>
<p>now," said Rae. Hughes said nothing, but went to look for
</p>
<p>Mr. Kemmis. He met Mr. Kemmis in Kildare-street, near his
</p>
<p>own house, and told him that he had made a mistake, that he had
</p>
<p>introduced Barrett improperly into the affidavit. What does Mr.
</p>
<p>Kemmis say ? Nothing. Gentlemen, the alteration in the affidavit
</p>
<p>would have been an awkward circumstance. It is not my province to
</p>
<p>comment on the conduct of the Crown Solicitor in the transaction ; the
</p>
<p>facts are before you. But I think, when you consider the great im-
</p>
<p>portance attached to the use of everything that was said by Mr. Bar-
</p>
<p>rett against Mr. O'Connell, you cannot but regret that the Crowa
</p>
<p>Solicitor took that very peculiar view of his official duty which he seems
</p>
<p>to have adopted. I cannot see why other editors were not indicted.
</p>
<p>Three editors of three newspapers are combined in this indictment ;
</p>
<p>but the editors of all the repeal papers in Ireland might have beenjoined.
</p>
<p>The editors of the Limerick Star, the Waterford Chronicle, and
</p>
<p>other newspapers in the south of Ireland, might have beenjoined;

</p>
<p>they are all members of the Repeal Association ; all conspirators, ac-
</p>
<p>cording to the Attorney-General. Every article of theirs might have
</p>
<p>been given in evidence. Gentlemen, I believe that no persons are less
</p>
<p>disposed to combine together; and the gentlemen of the Press will for-
</p>
<p>give me if I venture to say so, no persons are less prone to act in a
</p>
<p>spirit of concord than the editors of newspapers. The most trifling
</p>
<p>circumstance is a source of alienation. The Public is their mistress, and
</p>
<p>they detest each other with a cordiality proportioned to their devoted-
</p>
<p>ness to the object of their affections. Only imagine Mr. Murray Mans-
</p>
<p>field, the Editor of the Evening Packet, and Mr. Remmy Sheehan,
</p>
<p>of the Evening Mail, indicted for a conspiracy ! I remember once
</p>
<p>hearing Mr. Barnes, the celebrated editor of the Times, when asked
</p>
<p>by Mr. Rogers what sort of a man a Mr. Tomkins was, replied
</p>
<p>"Tomkins? Dull dog, he reads the Herald.'" But see, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>2q
</p>
<p>298
</p>
<p>of the Jury, see the effect of this conspiracy, into which three
</p>
<p>editors of newspapers are brought. I believe there is an English
</p>
<p>gentleman on that jury. Will he be prepared to give his sanction
</p>
<p>to a prosecution against the Corn- Law League, against Mr. Bright and
</p>
<p>Mr. Cobden, founded on articles in the London newspapers? Will he
</p>
<p>think it right that the Morning Chronicle, the Globe, and the Sun,
</p>
<p>should all be joined in the same indictment : that every syllable which
</p>
<p>appeared in the Globe, the Sun, and the Chronicle, should be given
</p>
<p>in evidence against Mr. Cobden and Mr. Bright ? Would not the
</p>
<p>common sense, the plain justice of Englishmen, revolt against such a
</p>
<p>proceeding ? Gentlemen, there have been often in England trials
</p>
<p>for conspiracy like the present one, and English juries have been asked
</p>
<p>before now to find verdicts for conspiracy, but an English Attorney-
</p>
<p>General never fails to join to the counts for conspiracy, counts for
</p>
<p>attending unlawful assemblies, and counts for seditious language.
</p>
<p>In this case, 1 know not why, there is not a single count intro-
</p>
<p>duced except for conspiracy  conspiracy or nothing. It is not so in
</p>
<p>England. I take as a remarkable illustration of this the trial of
</p>
<p>Henry Hunt, to which reference has been made once or twice in the
</p>
<p>course of this trial. You know, Gentlemen, that when Henry Hunt
</p>
<p>was indicted, England was in a very perilous condition ; you know that
</p>
<p>in the north of England there was a great confederacy among the
</p>
<p>lower orders. It was proved before a Secret Committee of the House
</p>
<p>of Commons, of which the present Lord Derby, then Lord Stanley,
</p>
<p>wa3 Chairman, that large bodies of men were drilled at night in
</p>
<p>sequestered places, and were made familiar with the use of arms.
</p>
<p>It was proved in that very case that meetings were held, the result of
</p>
<p>previous concert ; that men attended these meetings armed. All
</p>
<p>this was accompanied by circumstances infinitely more alarming
</p>
<p>than any suggested in this case. Henry Hunt was indicted for con-
</p>
<p>spiracy ; he was also indicted for attending unlawful assemblies ; but
</p>
<p>an English jury refused to find him guilty of conspiracy, but found
</p>
<p>him guilty of attending unlawful assemblies, on the fourth count of
</p>
<p>the indictment. Gentlemen, the promises made at the time of the

</p>
<p>Union have not been fulfilled. English capital has not been adven-
</p>
<p>tured; Englishmen have preferred sinking their capital in the rocks
</p>
<p>of Mexico rather than embark it in this fine but unfortunate country.
</p>
<p>The magnificent predictions held out to us in the eloquent declama-
</p>
<p>tions of Mr. Pitt have not been realized, but let us, at all events,
</p>
<p>derive one advantage from it. Let English fair play, let English
</p>
<p>principles, let the spirit of English justice, the abhorrence which
</p>
<p>prevails in England of every unworthy expedient, let English loath-
</p>
<p>ing of constructive crime, find its way to Ireland. But it is not to
</p>
<p>England alone, thank God ! that I am enabled to refer for a salutary
</p>
<p>example of the aversion of twelve honest men to prosecutions for con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. There have been in this country trials for conspiracy. You
</p>
<p>all remember the case of Rex v. Forbes and Hanbidge, referred to
</p>
<p>in the course of this trial, in support of a legal proposition. I avail
</p>
<p>299
</p>
<p>myself of it now for another use. In that case a riot took place at the
</p>
<p>Theatre. Lord Wellesley imagined that there was a conspiracy to
</p>
<p>drive him out of the country. A prosecution for conspiracy was ac-
</p>
<p>cordingly instituted. The Protestant feeling in Ireland took fire ;
</p>
<p>addresses poured in from all parts of the country remonstrating
</p>
<p>against this stretch of prerogative. A Protestant jury did their
</p>
<p>duty, and refused to convict their compatriots and co-religionists.
</p>
<p>I remember well the Catholic party were rash enough at that time to
</p>
<p>wish for a conviction. They were under the influence of a fanatic
</p>
<p>partizanship ; they were not swayed by a true regard for their
</p>
<p>own interests. If there had been a conviction, it would have
</p>
<p>formed a precedent in this very case. Gentlemen, we live in
</p>
<p>times of strange political vicissitude. We have witnessed strange
</p>
<p>things within the last ten or twelve years, and strange things
</p>
<p>we may yet behold ; but God forbid  and I say it in the sincerity of
</p>
<p>my heart, for I hate ascendency in every form  God forbid that
</p>
<p>we or our children should live to see the time when four Catholic
</p>
<p>Judges shall be sitting on that Bench, when an array of Catholic
</p>
<p>counsel shall be engaged in the prosecution, when eleven Protes-
</p>
<p>tants shall be struck off the Jury by a Catholic Crown Solicitor, and
</p>
<p>when the counsel for the traversers shall have to address twelve Ca-
</p>
<p>tholic Jurors at the trial of a Protestant. I know full well the im-
</p>
<p>pressible tendency of power to abuse. It is therefore the duty, the
</p>
<p>solemn duty, it is the interest, the paramount interest of every one
</p>
<p>of us, before and above everything else, to secure the foundations of
</p>
<p>liberty, in which we all have an equal concern, from invasion, and
</p>
<p>to guard against the creation of a precedent which may enable some fu-
</p>
<p>ture Attorney-General to turn the Court of Queen's Bench into a Star
</p>
<p>Chamber, and to commit further inroads on the great principles of the
</p>
<p>Constitution. Gentlemen of the Jury, it is my intention to show to
</p>
<p>you that my client is not guilty of having combined with anybody for
</p>
<p>any one of the purposes mentioned in the indictment. In treating
</p>
<p>the several topics to which I shall apply myself, I shall have occasion
</p>
<p>to advert to the evidence laid before you, and to the proceedings

</p>
<p>adopted by the Government in the various stages of this prosecution ;
</p>
<p>but before I go to that part of the case, I shall show you what the
</p>
<p>object of my client was ; I shall show you that his object was a legal
</p>
<p>one, and that he endeavoured to obtain it by legal means. The At-
</p>
<p>torney-General, in his speech, entered into a wide field. He was
</p>
<p>exceedingly, but not illegitimately, discursive. He introduced a
</p>
<p>great variety of topics. He referred to speeches of Sir Robert
</p>
<p>Peel and Lord John Russell; to a Report of the Committee of the
</p>
<p>House of Lords in 1797: to the great transactions of 1782. I do
</p>
<p>not at all complain of this in a case of such importance ; it is right to
</p>
<p>endeavour to obtain light wherever it can be found. Gentlemen, I
</p>
<p>shall go back a little beyond the year 1782; but do not be alarmed,
</p>
<p>for you will find that I can traverse with rapidity a long tract of time.
</p>
<p>1 know no author who has given a more accurate account of the state
</p>
<p>300
</p>
<p>of Ireland, and of the first struggle for the assertion of her rights,
</p>
<p>than the great Sir Walter Scott. He was bred and born a Tory. He,
</p>
<p>perhaps, was not entirely free from some disrelish towards Ireland :
</p>
<p>but when he came among us his opinions underwent considerable
</p>
<p>alteration. The man who for Scotland felt that attachment which
</p>
<p>he has so beautifully expressed in those lines which you heard quoted
</p>
<p>in the course of this trial, could make allowance for those who felt
</p>
<p>the same love for the land of their birth. Sir Walter Scott wrote
</p>
<p>the Life of Swift, and in page 248 of that work, which I hold in my
</p>
<p>hand, he says, " Molyneux, the friend of Locke and of liberty,
</p>
<p>" published in 1698, ' The Case of Ireland, being bound by Acts of
</p>
<p>" Parliament in England, stated,' in which he showed with great
</p>
<p>" force, that the right of legislation, of which England made so op-
</p>
<p>" pressive a use, was neither justifiable by the plea of conquest, pur-
</p>
<p>" chase, or precedent, and was only submitted to from incapacity of
</p>
<p>" effectual resistance. The temper of the English House of Com-
</p>
<p>" mons did not brook these remonstrances. It was unanimously voted
</p>
<p>" that these bold and pernicious assertions were calculated to shake
</p>
<p>" the subordination and dependence of Ireland, as united and annexed
</p>
<p>" for ever to the Crown of England, and the vote of the house was
</p>
<p>" followed by an address to the Queen, complaining that although
</p>
<p>" the woollen trade was the staple manufacture of England, over
</p>
<p>.*' which her legislation was accustomed to watch with the utmost
</p>
<p>" care, yet Ireland, which was dependent upon and protected by
</p>
<p>" England, not contented with the linen manufacture, the liberty
</p>
<p>" whereof was indulged to her, presumed also to apply her credit and
</p>
<p>" capital to the weaving of her own wool and woollen cloths, to the
</p>
<p>" great detriment of England. Not a voice was raised in the British
</p>
<p>" House of Commons to contradict maxims equally impolitic and
</p>
<p>" tyrannical. In acting upon these commercial restrictions, wrong
</p>
<p>" was heaped upon wrong, and insult was added to injury  with this
</p>
<p>" advantage on the side of the aggressors, that they could intimidate
</p>
<p>" the people of Ireland into silence, by raising, to drown every com-
</p>
<p>" plaint, the cry of ' rebel' and ' Jacobite.'" Swift came to Ireland

<p>in 1714. At first he dedicated himself exclusively to literary pursuits,
</p>
<p>but when he had seen the oppressions under which the people of Ire-
</p>
<p>land laboured, his spirit caught fire, and he exclaimed to his friend
</p>
<p>Delany, " Do not the villanies of men eat into your flesh ?"
</p>
<p>In 1710, he published a proposal for the use of Irish manufac-
</p>
<p>tures. The Attorney-General of the day represented this tract as
</p>
<p>calculated to excite hostility between the different classes of his Ma-
</p>
<p>jesty's people, one of the charges preferred in this indictment. A
</p>
<p>prosecution was determined on. At that time the Judges of this
</p>
<p>country did not enjoy what they now possess, " fixity of tenure."
</p>
<p>They are now, thank God, no longer tenants at will ; and I speak
</p>
<p>with unaffected sincerity  and let that be understood by all those
</p>
<p>that hear me, when I read the passage that follows  such scenes
</p>
<p>as occurred at that period cannot possibly recur. The Judges
</p>
<p>301
</p>
<p>may for a moment be under the influence of mistaken feelings
</p>
<p> they may be blinded by strong emotions ; but corrupt they can-
</p>
<p>not be. " The storm which Swift had raised was not long in
</p>
<p>" bursting. It was intimated to Lord Chief Justice Whitshed by a
</p>
<p>" person in great office" (this, if I remember right, was the expression
</p>
<p>used by Mr. Boss, in reference to a great unknown, who sent him
</p>
<p>here), " that Swift's pamphlet was published for the purpose of set-
</p>
<p>" ting the two kingdoms at variance; and it was recommended that
</p>
<p>" the printer should be prosecuted with the uttermost rigour. Whit-
</p>
<p>" shed was not a person to neglect such a hint, and the arguments
</p>
<p>" of Government were so successful, that the Grand Juries of the
</p>
<p>" county and city presented the Dean's pamphlet as a seditious, fac-
</p>
<p>" tious, and virulent libel. Waters, the printer, was seized, and
</p>
<p>" forced to give great bail ; but, upon his trial, the Jury, though
</p>
<p>" some pains had been bestowed in selecting them> brought him
</p>
<p>" in not guilty ; and it was not until they were worn out by the
</p>
<p>" Lord Chief Justice, who detained them eleven hours, and sent
</p>
<p>" them nine times to reconsider their verdict, that they, at length,
</p>
<p>" reluctantly left the matter in his hands, by a special verdict; but
</p>
<p>f the measures of Whitshed were too violent to be of service to the
</p>
<p>" Government ; men's minds revolted against his iniquitous con-
</p>
<p>" duct." Sir Walter Scott then proceeds to give an account of
</p>
<p>the famous Draper's Letters. After speaking of the first three,
</p>
<p>Sir Walter Scott says, " It was now obvious, from the temper of
</p>
<p>" Ireland, that the true point of difference between the two coun-
</p>
<p>" tries might safely be brought before the public." Swift was
</p>
<p>not dismayed by that prosecution from exhorting his countrymen to
</p>
<p>resort to the only means by which a redress of their grievances could
</p>
<p>be obtained, and accordingly he published the celebrated Draper's
</p>
<p>Letters ; and in his fourth letter he has the audacity to complain 
</p>
<p>of what, do you think ?  of the exclusive employment of natives of
</p>
<p>England in places of trust and emolument in Ireland, of the depen-
</p>
<p>dence of that kingdom on England, and the power assumed, con-
</p>
<p>trary to truth, reason, and justice, of binding her by the laws of

</p>
<p>a Parliament in which she had no representation. And, Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, is it a question too bold of me to ask, whether if Ireland have
</p>
<p>no effective representation ; if the wishes and feelings of the repre-
</p>
<p>sentatives of Ireland upon Irish questions are held to be of no ac-
</p>
<p>count; if the Irish representation is utterly merged in the English,
</p>
<p>and the minister does not, by a judicious policy, endeavour to coun-
</p>
<p>teract it  as he might, in the opinion of many men, effectually do 
</p>
<p>is not the practical result exactly the same as if Ireland had not a
</p>
<p>single representative in Parliament? Gentlemen, Swift addressed
</p>
<p>the people of Ireland upon this great topic, in language as strong as
</p>
<p>any that Daniel O'Connell has employed. " The remedy," he says,
</p>
<p>" is wholly in your own hands By the laws of God, of
</p>
<p>" nations, and of your country, you are, and ought to be, as free a
</p>
<p>" people as your brethren in England." " This tract," says Sir
</p>
<p>302
</p>
<p>Walter Scott, " pressed at once upon the real merits of the ques-
</p>
<p>" tion at issue, and the alarm was instantly taken by the English
</p>
<p>" Government, the necessity of supporting whose domination devolved
</p>
<p>" upon Cartaret, who was just landed, and accordingly a proclamation
</p>
<p>" was issued, offering 300 reward for the discovery of the author of
</p>
<p>" the Diaper's fourth letter, described as a wicked and malicious
</p>
<p>" pamphlet, containingseveralseditiousandscandalous passages, highly
</p>
<p>" reflecting upon His Majesty and his ministers, and tending to alienate
</p>
<p>" the affections of his good subjects in England and Ireland from each
</p>
<p>" other." Sir Walter, after mentioning one or two interesting anec-
</p>
<p>dotes, says : " When the bill against the printer of the Draper's Let-
</p>
<p>" ters was about to be presented to the Grand Jury, Swift addressed
</p>
<p>" to that body a paper, entitled ' Seasonable Advice,' exhorting them
</p>
<p>" to remember the story of the Leyone mode, by which the wolves
</p>
<p>" were placed with the sheep, on condition of parting with their shep-
</p>
<p>" herds and mastiffs, after which they ravaged the flock at pleasure."
</p>
<p>A few spirited verses, addressed to the citizens at large, and enforcing
</p>
<p>similar topics, are subscribed by the Draper's initials, and are doubt-
</p>
<p>less Swift's own composition, alluding to the charge that he had gone
</p>
<p>too far in leaving the discussion of Wood's project to treat of the al-
</p>
<p>leged dependence of Ireland. He concludes in these lines :
</p>
<p>" If, then, oppression has not quite subdued
</p>
<p>At once your prudence and your gratitude 
</p>
<p>If you yourselves conspire not your undoing 
</p>
<p>And don't deserve, and won't bring down your ruin 
</p>
<p>If yet to virtue you have some pretence 
</p>
<p>If yet you are not lost to common sense,
</p>
<p>Assist your patriots in your own defence ;
</p>
<p>That stupid cant, ' he went too far,' despise,
</p>
<p>And know that to be brave is to be wise ;
</p>
<p>Think how he struggled for your liberty,
</p>
<p>And give him freedom while yourselves are free."
</p>
<p>At the same time was circulated the memorable and apt quotation
</p>
<p>from Scripture, by a Quaker (I don't know, Gentlemen, whether his

<p>name was Robinson, but it ought to have been) : " And the people
</p>
<p>" said unto Saul, shall Jonathan die who hath wrought this great sal-
</p>
<p>" vation in Israel. God forbid ! As the Lord liveth there shall not
</p>
<p>" one hair of his head fall to the ground, for he hath wrought with
</p>
<p>" God this day; so the people rescued Jonathan, and he died not."
</p>
<p>Thus admonished by verse, law, and Scripture, the Grand Jury as-
</p>
<p>sembled. It was in vain that Lord Chief Justice Whitshed, who had
</p>
<p>denounced the Dean's former tract as seditious, and procured a ver-
</p>
<p>dict against the prisoner, exerted himself upon a similar occasion.
</p>
<p>The hour for intimidation was passed. Sir Walter Scott, after detail-
</p>
<p>ing instances of the violence of Whitshed, and describing the rest of
</p>
<p>the Dean's letters, says: "Thus victoriously terminated the first
</p>
<p>" grand struggle for the independence of Ireland. The eyes of the
</p>
<p>" kingdom were now turned with one consent upon the man by
</p>
<p>" whose unbending fortitude and preeminent talent this triumph
</p>
<p>303
</p>
<p>" was accomplished. The Draper's head became a sign ; his por-
</p>
<p>" trait was engraved, worn upon handkerchiefs, struck upon me-
</p>
<p>" dais, and displayed in every possible manner as the Liberator of
</p>
<p>" Ireland." Well might that epithet "grand" be applied to the
</p>
<p>first great struggle by the immortal Scotchman, who was him-
</p>
<p>self so grand of soul, and who, of mental loftiness, as well as of the
</p>
<p>magnificence of external nature, had a conception so fine. And well
</p>
<p>might our own immortal Grattan, so great and so good, in speaking
</p>
<p>of his own great achievement in 1782, address to the spirit of Swift
</p>
<p>and to the spirit of Molyneux his enthusiastic invocation ; and may
</p>
<p>not I, in the circumstances in which I am placed, offer up, without
</p>
<p>irreverence, the prayer, that of the spirit by which the soul of Henry
</p>
<p>Grattan was animated, every remnant may not be extinguished in
</p>
<p>the breasts of his countrymen. But let me not permit myself, Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, to be carried away by enthusiasm from that more sober cast of
</p>
<p>thought, with which the topics connected with the great incident to
</p>
<p>which I have adverted ought to be considered. How was it that the
</p>
<p>independence of Ireland was achieved in 1782 ? Was it by adopting
</p>
<p>the language of calm discussion? Was it by humbly expostulating
</p>
<p>with the British Parliament, and submitting to them a meek state-
</p>
<p>ment of the grievances of the country? I am well aware that we
</p>
<p>shall be told that a Government, so beneficent as the present is,
</p>
<p>anxious to govern the country with impartiality ; anxious to avoid
</p>
<p>all party distinctions, will never turn an unheeding ear to the
</p>
<p>calm statement of the grievances under which the people of Ireland
</p>
<p>may conceive themselves to be labouring. But, Gentlemen, I do
</p>
<p>not find, in reading the history of any country, that, by such means,
</p>
<p>the redress of any one grievance was ever yet obtained. It was not, at
</p>
<p>all events, by following such suggestions that the liberty of Ireland
</p>
<p>was accomplished by the great conspirators of 1782. England would
</p>
<p>have coerced them if she could have ventured to do so. But Eng-
</p>
<p>lish statesmen, in their struggles with America, had been taught a
</p>
<p>salutary lesson from adversity, the only schoolmistress, from whom
</p>
<p>statesmen seem capable of learning anything, but who charges

</p>
<p>so much blood, so much gold, and such torrents of tears for her
</p>
<p>instructions. In reading the history of that fatal struggle, in
</p>
<p>tracing the gradual descent of England from the tone of haughty
</p>
<p>dictation to that of disaster and of despair, it is impossible not to
</p>
<p>be struck with many painful analogies. If in time  if the English
</p>
<p>minister had listened in time to the eloquent warning of Chatham,
</p>
<p>and to the still more oracular admonitions of Burke, what a world of
</p>
<p>woe would have been saved ! He repented when it was too late ; the
</p>
<p>colonies were lost; but Ireland was saved, by the recognition of a
</p>
<p>great and just principle. I told you that the Attorney-General of the
</p>
<p>day did not indict Charlemont, and Grattan, and Flood, for a conspi-
</p>
<p>racy. The people of Ireland were then influenced by a sentiment of
</p>
<p>nationality too exalted, and by that love of country, which God,
</p>
<p>for his wise purposes, has impl anted in our nature. We were a
</p>
<p>304
</p>
<p>nation then ; we were not divided by those miserable religious dis-
</p>
<p>tinctions by which we are now distracted and degraded. If we
</p>
<p>were eight millions of Protestants,  and sometimes I have been
</p>
<p>for a moment betrayed into the guilty desire that we were  do
</p>
<p>you think that England would use us as she does ? Do you think we
</p>
<p>should submit to the system under which every place of dignity and
</p>
<p>emolument should be awarded to natives of the sister country ? Do
</p>
<p>you think that we should not insist that a large portion of the revenue
</p>
<p>should be expended in works of public improvement here ? Do you
</p>
<p>not think that we should insist that the quit-rents and crown-rents
</p>
<p>should be expended in our own country, instead of being applied to
</p>
<p>enlarge Charing-cross, or embellish Windsor Palace ? Should we
</p>
<p>submit to the odious distinctions between Englishmen and Irishmen,
</p>
<p>introduced into almost every act of legislation? Should we bear with
</p>
<p>an Arms' Bill, by which the Bill of Rights is set at nought ? Should
</p>
<p>we brook the misapplication of a Poor Law ? Should we allow the
</p>
<p>Parliament to proceed as if we had not a voice in the Legislature?
</p>
<p>Should we submit to our present inadequate representation ? Should
</p>
<p>we allow a new tariff to be introduced without the slightest equiva-
</p>
<p>lent for the manifest loss we have sustained? And should we not
</p>
<p>peremptorily require that the Imperial Parliament should hold a perio-
</p>
<p>dical session, for the transaction of Irish business, in the metropolis
</p>
<p>of a powerful and, as it would then be, an undivided country ? But
</p>
<p>we are prevented by our wretched religious distinctions from coope-
</p>
<p>rating for a single object by which the honour and substantial inte-
</p>
<p>rests of our country can be promoted. Fatal, disastrous, detestable
</p>
<p>distinctions ! Detestable, not only because they are revolting to the
</p>
<p>true principles of Christianity, and because they substitute for true
</p>
<p>religion the rancorous antipathies of sect, but because they make
</p>
<p>the Union a mere name, substitute for a real Union a mere parch-
</p>
<p>ment ligament, which may be snapped by an event, convert a nation
</p>
<p>into an appurtenance, make a great country the footstool of the British
</p>
<p>minister, and render us the scorn of England and the commiseration
</p>
<p>of the world. There is not a country in Europe where the abomina-

</p>
<p>ble distinctions between Catholic and Protestant are permitted to
</p>
<p>continue. Is it not extraordinary that in Germany, where Luther
</p>
<p>translated the Scriptures; in France, where Calvin wrote the In-
</p>
<p>stitutes ; in the country of the Dragonades and St. Bartholo-
</p>
<p>mews ; in the country from whence the forefathers of a Judge
</p>
<p>on that bench, and of the first ministerial officer of the Court,
</p>
<p>were inhumanly and barbarously driven, the mutual wrongs of Pro-
</p>
<p>testant and Catholic are not only forgotten, but forgiven ; while we,
</p>
<p>madmen that we are, arrayed against each other by that fell fanati-
</p>
<p>cism, which, driven from every other country, has found refuge
</p>
<p>here, precipitate ourselves on each other in that fierce encounter,
</p>
<p>in which our country, bleeding and lacerated, is trodden under foot ;
</p>
<p>convert an island, which ought to be the most fortunate in the sea,
</p>
<p>305
</p>
<p>to a receptacle of misery and of degradation ; counteract the designs of
</p>
<p>Providence, and become conspirators against the beneficent intents
</p>
<p>of God. Gentlemen, it is admitted on all hands, it was admitted by
</p>
<p>Mr. Dundas and by Mr. Pitt, that the progress of improvement made
</p>
<p>by Ireland after the accession of her liberty, was marvellously rapid.
</p>
<p>Once having- entered the career of improvement, she ran so fast, that
</p>
<p>England was afraid of being- overtaken. Her commerce and her ma-
</p>
<p>nufactures doubled ; the plough climbed to the top of the mountain,
</p>
<p>and found its way to the centre of the morass. The moral and phy-
</p>
<p>sical aspect of the country was at once transformed. This city be-
</p>
<p>came one of the noblest capitals of the world ; wealth, and rank, and
</p>
<p>genius, and eloquence, and every intellectual accomplishment, all the
</p>
<p>attributes by which men's minds are exalted, refined, and embellished,
</p>
<p>were gathered here. Of that prosperity the memorials remain ; of
</p>
<p>that prosperity architecture has left us its magnificent attestation ;
</p>
<p>this temple, dedicated to justice, is one of the witnesses, silent and
</p>
<p>solemn, of that glorious time to which I may appeal. It is seen afar
</p>
<p>off; it rises high above the din and smoke of this populous city: 
</p>
<p>Be it the type of that moral elevation over any contaminating influ-
</p>
<p>ence above which every man, engaged in the administration of justice,
</p>
<p>ought to ascend. The penal laws were enacted by slaves ; they were
</p>
<p>relaxed by freemen. In 1782, the Protestants of Ireland acquired po-
</p>
<p>litical liberty, and they gave us civil privileges. They had been con-
</p>
<p>tented to kneel to England on the Catholic neck. They assumed a
</p>
<p>nobler attitude, and they permitted us to get up. In 1782, they ac-
</p>
<p>quired political rights ; in 1793 they gave us the elective franchise, a
</p>
<p>word of noble etymology ; and I have no doubt that a satisfactory ad-
</p>
<p>justment of the Catholic question might have been made by the Irish
</p>
<p>Parliament. The prosperity of the country was blasted by that mi-
</p>
<p>serable rebellion which you have heard repudiated in the speeches of
</p>
<p>my learned friend. Though " The Memory of the Dead," a poem, pub-
</p>
<p>lished in the Nation, had been read to you in evidence, Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell's d-etestation of the Irish rebellion has been proved to you beyond
</p>
<p>doubt. The rebellion led to the Union. The plan of the Union, you

<p>will find, was borrowed by Mr. Pitt from that great captain and states-
</p>
<p>man, Oliver Cromwell, to whom the gentry of this country are under
</p>
<p>such essential obligations. It must be admitted on all hands, that by
</p>
<p>their loyalty they make ample compensation for the republican origin
</p>
<p>of their estates. Oliver Cromwell returned four hundred members
</p>
<p>for England, thirty for Scotland, and thirty for Ireland. The thirty
</p>
<p>returned for Ireland were Englishmen, gallant soldiers, men who had
</p>
<p>conferred great services on England ; one would have imagined,
</p>
<p>that, when they were returned to the English Parliament, they
</p>
<p>would have met with a cordial welcome from their English brethren.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, in reading matter connected with this case, I had the
</p>
<p>curiosity to look into a report of the debates in Cromwell's Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment, taken by Thomas Burton, who was a member of the Parlia-
</p>
<p>2R
</p>
<p>306
</p>
<p>nients of Oliver and Richard Cromwell from 1656 to 1659. He took
</p>
<p>a diary of the debates of the United Parliament of England and Ire-
</p>
<p>land. A few years ago the manuscript was found in the British
</p>
<p>Museum. It was published, and contains some curious matter.
</p>
<p>You will be surprised to hear that the reception given to the de-
</p>
<p>puties from Ireland was very different from that which I have an-
</p>
<p>ticipated. They were considered as in some sort contaminated by
</p>
<p>the air which they had breathed in this country, and were most
</p>
<p>uncourteously treated by the English members. A gentleman whose
</p>
<p>name ought to have been Copley says, " these men are foreign-
</p>
<p>" ers :" the following is the speech : " Mr. Gewen said : ' it is not
</p>
<p>" ' for the honour of the English nation for foreigners to come and
</p>
<p>" ' have power in this nation. They are but provinces at best.' Doc-
</p>
<p>" tor Clarges says, on behalf of Ireland, page 114: ' They (the Irish)
</p>
<p>" ' were united with you, and have always had an equal right with
</p>
<p>" ' you. He that was King of England was King of Ireland or Lord.
</p>
<p>" ' If you give not a right to sit here, you must injustice let them
</p>
<p>" ' have a Parliament at home. How safe that will be, I question.
</p>
<p>" ' Those that sit for them are not Irish Teagues, but faithful per-
</p>
<p>V 'sons.' Mr. Gewen again observes: ' It were better both forEng-
</p>
<p>"  land and for Ireland that they had Parliaments of their own. It
</p>
<p>" ' is neither safe, just, nor honourable to admit them. Let them ra-
</p>
<p>" ' ther have a Parliament of their own.' Mr. Annesley observes : ' If
</p>
<p>" 'you speak as to the convenience in relation to England, much
</p>
<p>" ' more is to be said why those who serve for Scotland should sit
</p>
<p>"'here. It is one continent, and elections are easier determined ;
</p>
<p>" ' but Ireland differs. It is much fitter for them to have Parlia-
</p>
<p>" ' ments of their own. That was the old constitution ; it will be
</p>
<p>" ' difficult to change it, and dangerous for Ireland. They are under
</p>
<p>" ' an impossibility of redress Their grievances can never be
</p>
<p>" ' redressed. Elections can never be intermixed. Though they
</p>
<p>' ' were but a province, there were Courts of Justice and Parliaments
</p>
<p>" 'as free as here I pray that they may have soon to hear
</p>
<p>"  their grievances in their own nation, seeing that they cannot have

<p>" ' them heard here.' Sir Thomas Stanley observes: ' I am not to
</p>
<p>" 'speak for Ireland, but for the English in Ireland The
</p>
<p>" ' members for Ireland and the electors are all Englishmen, who na-
</p>
<p>" ' tnrally claim to have votes in making laws by which they must be
</p>
<p>" ' governed ; they have fought your battles, obtained and preserved
</p>
<p>" 'your interests, designed by the famous long Parliament, obtained
</p>
<p>" ' by blood, and sought for by prayer solemnly.' "
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you may ask me, why I have read to you these sin-
</p>
<p>gular passages ? I will tell you why. The form of government may
</p>
<p>change  institutions may change  but the national character of
</p>
<p>a country, like its language, is not susceptible of alteration. The
</p>
<p>instinct of domination will prevail for centuries. Towards the
</p>
<p>Protestants of Ireland, when the Papists were ground to powder,
</p>
<p>the very same feeling prevailed, of which we see manifestations
</p>
<p>307
</p>
<p>to this very hour. The question is not between Catholic and Pro-
</p>
<p>testant, but between the greater country and the smaller, which
</p>
<p>the greater country endeavours to keep under an ignominious con-
</p>
<p>trol. Many of the men who voted for the Union lived to repent
</p>
<p>it; and Lord Clare himself, when designated as a plebeian peer by
</p>
<p>a great Whig patrician, lamented the mistake which he had com-
</p>
<p>mitted. The Union was carried by corruption and by fear. The
</p>
<p>shriek of the rebellion still echoed in the nation's ear. The Habeas
</p>
<p>Corpus Act had been suspended, and martial law had been pro-
</p>
<p>claimed. The country was in a state of siege. The minister was
</p>
<p>supplied with a purse of gold for the senator, and a rod of iron for
</p>
<p>the people ; yet that corruption, at which even Sir Robert Walpole
</p>
<p>would have been astonished, was resisted by the genius and patriotism
</p>
<p>of some of the most eminent men that this country ever produced.
</p>
<p>There was arrayed against the minister, Grattan, Curran, Ponsonby,
</p>
<p>Foster, and almost all the distinguished men of that time, the brightest
</p>
<p>in our history. Goold, whose admirable speech is given by Sir
</p>
<p>Jonah Barrington, in his " Rise and Fall of the Irish Nation," Saurin,
</p>
<p>Bushe, Joy, and Plunket, to whom I shall presently call your atten-
</p>
<p>tion. Gentlemen, the Attorney-General in his speech said, that it
</p>
<p>was not legitimate to refer to the opinions expressed by Saurin and
</p>
<p>other eminent men of the time, as if what is said in debate is not to
</p>
<p>be regarded as the language of sincerity ; as if what is said in Par-
</p>
<p>liamentary debate is suggested merely by party considerations. The
</p>
<p>Attorney-General for Ireland appeared to me to take a singular view
</p>
<p>when he pressed this subject on you. He has been but a short
</p>
<p>time in Parliament, I have heard something from him of the mora-
</p>
<p>lity of war, and something, I believe, of the morality of rebellion,
</p>
<p>but I must say, the light thrown by him on the morality of Parliament
</p>
<p>is curious indeed. I will only say, that when he made his observa-
</p>
<p>tions on Mr. Saurin's speech, it brought to my mind a debate which I
</p>
<p>heard in the House of Commons on the subject of the education ques-
</p>
<p>tion. Mr. Saurin founded his opinion on the authority of Locke. Mr.
</p>
<p>Plunket, whose speech produced an impression never surpassed in the

</p>
<p>House of Commons, denied the right of Parliament to destroy itself.
</p>
<p>Bushe took a similar course  Bushe, whom we have lost so lately,
</p>
<p>whom it was impossible for those by whom the highest genius and the
</p>
<p>noblest eloquence were prized not to admire  whom it was impossible for
</p>
<p>those, by whom the highest worth is justly estimated, not to respect
</p>
<p>and reverence, and whom it was impossible for those not to love who
</p>
<p>could appreciate as generous a heart as ever beat in a human breast.
</p>
<p>Such were the sentiments of many illustrious men, expressed in debate,
</p>
<p>I admit, but great principles are not of an age ; they are of all time ; they
</p>
<p>are imperishable and everlasting; they are as immortal as the mind of
</p>
<p>man, incapable of decomposition or decay. The question before you,
</p>
<p>however, is not whether these principles are well or ill founded. That
</p>
<p>is not the point upon which your decision is to turn ; but yon are to take
</p>
<p>into consideration that the men who are arraigned before you were
</p>
<p>308
</p>
<p>made familiar with those principles by men whose eloquence still echoes
</p>
<p>in the nation's mind, and if they have been led astray, they have
</p>
<p>been led astray by the authority of men with whom it is surely not
</p>
<p>criminal to coincide. If the traversers at the bar, if my client, made
</p>
<p>familiar with this doctrine, expressed in language so glowing- and so
</p>
<p>attractive, have come to the conclusion, that the Union was not
</p>
<p>only an injurious measure, but was a measure at variance with all
</p>
<p>constitutional principles, and was carried by what amounted to an
</p>
<p>infringement of a great nation's rights, you must make allowance
</p>
<p>for any vehemence of feeling, you must excuse any violence of ex-
</p>
<p>pression, into which they may have been betrayed. The Union,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, was a bargain and sale ; the sale was pro-
</p>
<p>fligate, and the bargain was bad. Bad terms were made for the
</p>
<p>country; better terms ought to have been obtained. As was ob-
</p>
<p>served by Mr. O'Connell, in one of the speeches read to you, two-
</p>
<p>thirds of the representation of Ireland were suppressed, and not a
</p>
<p>single English member was abstracted. What was the consequence '(
</p>
<p>A consequence as injurious to Ireland as if the dependence of its Par-
</p>
<p>liament had been restored. The hundred members allowed to Ireland
</p>
<p>were lost and merged in the English majority, and on an Irish ques-
</p>
<p>tion, on a question in which the interests of Ireland only are involved,
</p>
<p>she has practically no voice in the legislature. I do not mean to say
</p>
<p>that this evil might not be cured by a wise and bold minister; such
</p>
<p>a man might trace, with the sanction of the majority of the Irish
</p>
<p>members, a policy which would remedy the evil. But it is not the
</p>
<p>wish of the British ministry to govern Ireland according to the opinion
</p>
<p>f the majority of the Irish representatives. If they did entertain
</p>
<p>such a wish, they would be opposed by the prejudice of English mem-
</p>
<p>bers. But whether that position arises from prejudice or conviction,
</p>
<p>the result is exactly the same as if the old system of a dependent Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment was restored ; but supposing the principle on which the Union was
</p>
<p>carried to have been unconstitutional, supposing it to have been a nullity,
</p>
<p>and on that subject I am not called on to give any sort of opinion ; sup-
</p>
<p>posing it to have been injurious atthe time, yet if the results of the Union

</p>
<p>have been beneficial to the country, the Union should be maintained, the
</p>
<p>cry of Repeal should not be listened to, and should never have arisen.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, we hear that the manufactures of this country have aug-
</p>
<p>mented, that its commerce has increased, but if there is one fact be-
</p>
<p>yond doubt, it is this, that the great majority, the great bulk of the
</p>
<p>people are in a condition more miserable than that of any other coun-
</p>
<p>try. The greater happiness of the greater number may be a Bentha-
</p>
<p>mite antithesis, but in that phrase a great deal of Christianity is con-
</p>
<p>densed. If you find in any country that the inhabitants of it, the
</p>
<p>great bulk of the people, are in a state of degradation and destitu-
</p>
<p>tion, must you not come to the conclusion that the government of the
</p>
<p>country is carried on on imperfect or mistaken principles. What is the
</p>
<p>cause of the people of this country being in the condition that they
</p>
<p>are ? Why is it, that when travellers laud amongst us from the United
</p>
<p>309
</p>
<p>States, from Germany, or from France, although prepared, by previous
</p>
<p>description, for the exhibition of the misery which is disclosed to
</p>
<p>them, yet, at the spectacle which presents itself, they stand appalled
</p>
<p>and aghast ? Is the cause in the air, or the soil, or is it the genius
</p>
<p>loci that produces it ? Or is the fault in the Government ? Let
</p>
<p>us see, Gentlemen, whether I can make out my case by taking a
</p>
<p>retrospect of the leading facts connected with the subject. I shall
</p>
<p>go through them with great celerity; but in a case of this kind,
</p>
<p>you will not consider me wantonly prolix, even if I should trespass
</p>
<p>at more than ordinary length upon your attention. I shall make
</p>
<p>you no excuse: your time is valuable, but the interests at stake are
</p>
<p>of inestimable price, and you will take no account of time when you
</p>
<p>bear in mind the effects of your verdict. They will be felt when
</p>
<p>generations shall have passed away, when every heart that throbs in
</p>
<p>this great assembly shall have ceased to palpitate, when the conten-
</p>
<p>tions by which we are agitated shall no further touch us, and all of us,
</p>
<p>Protestant, Catholic, Radical, Repealer, Tory, Conservative, shall
</p>
<p>have been gathered where all at last lie down in peace together.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, what was the first measure adopted in the Imperial
</p>
<p>Parliament with respect to Ireland? The very first measure which
</p>
<p>was introduced after the Union into the Imperial Parliament, was
</p>
<p>the enactment of martial law, and the suspension of the Habeas
</p>
<p>Corpus. Mr. Pitt intended to carry Catholic Emancipation imme-
</p>
<p>diately after the Union, and he intended at the same time to connect
</p>
<p>the Catholic Church with the State. You may think that Catholic Eman-
</p>
<p>cipation ought not to have been granted ; many in this Court may
</p>
<p>entertain that conscientious conviction, but you must admit, that if
</p>
<p>carried at all, it ought to have been carried sooner. If carried at
</p>
<p>all, it should not have been carried after the twenty-nine years of the
</p>
<p>political laceration which this country has endured; and the fact, the
</p>
<p>striking fact, that Mr. Pitt was unable to carry the question which
</p>
<p>he regarded to be the immediate corollary of the Union, is a proof
</p>
<p>to you that the policy could not be adopted by him, which he con-
</p>
<p>sidered necessary to the benefit of this country. Mr. Pitt, by

<p>transferring the Catholic question from the Irish to the Imperial
</p>
<p>Parliament, destroyed his own administration, and furnished a proof
</p>
<p>that in place of being able to place Ireland under the protection of
</p>
<p>his great genius, he placed her under the control of the strong reli-
</p>
<p>gious influence of the English people. He went out, and Mr. Ad-
</p>
<p>dington came into office. Mr. Pitt returned to office without
</p>
<p>stipulatingfor Catholic Emancipation. The question was again brought
</p>
<p>forward in 1805, and lost by an English majority in the Imperial House
</p>
<p>of Commons. Mr. Pitt died of the battle of Austerlitz, and the
</p>
<p>Whigs came in in 1806. The Whigs attempted to introduce a mea-
</p>
<p>sure of partial relief to the Roman Catholics, but the Tories raised the
</p>
<p>No- Popery cry, and drove them out, and introduced the new doctrine
</p>
<p>that the usefulness of public measures is to be tried, far less by the
</p>
<p>principles on which they are founded, than by the parties by whom
</p>
<p>they are accomplished. When the change of Government was effected
</p>
<p>by the " No-Popery" cry, a proof was given that the government of
</p>
<p>310
</p>
<p>Ireland was transferred, not merely to the Imperial Parliament, but
</p>
<p>to the opposition and prejudices of the English people. The reli-
</p>
<p>gious prejudices, perhaps the conscientious feelings, which existed at
</p>
<p>that period among the great mass of the English people, caused the
</p>
<p>change of government, and the procrastination of the measure, which
</p>
<p>has been fraught with such fearful consequences. The Tories came
</p>
<p>into office in 1807. They found two measures in the portfolio of
</p>
<p>the Whigs; a draft bill for Catholic Emancipation, which the Duke
</p>
<p>of Wellington, then Sir Arthur Wellesley, the Secretary for Ire-
</p>
<p>land, flung into the fire, and an Arms' Bill. Do not imagine that
</p>
<p>lam going into a description of the Arms' Bill, but this I will ob-
</p>
<p>serve, it was either necessary or unnecessary. If unnecessary, how
</p>
<p>monstrous a violation was it of the Bill of Rights! If necessary,
</p>
<p>what a reflection is that necessity on the system of government car-
</p>
<p>ried on in this country ! It is beyond question that in this year
</p>
<p>1819, when England was on the verge of a rebellion, no such bill
</p>
<p>was ever propounded by the British ministry. The Tories, having
</p>
<p>carried the Arms' Bill, and the Insurrection Act, its appropriate ad-
</p>
<p>junct, proceeded to reduce the provision allowed to the College of
</p>
<p>Maynooth. One word only on that subject. Either the College of
</p>
<p>Maynooth ought to be abolished, or it ought to be largely endowed,
</p>
<p>in order that an education should be given to the Roman Catholic
</p>
<p>clergy such as a body exercising such vast influence ought to receive.
</p>
<p>Some suggest that it would be better that the Roman Catholic clergy
</p>
<p>should be educated in France. But I hope never to see such a con-
</p>
<p>ductor established between the Tuilleries and this country. I hope
</p>
<p>never to see a Gallo-Hibernian Church established here. I hope
</p>
<p>never to see Parisian manners acquired at the expense of the mo-
</p>
<p>rality of the Irish priesthood. I am too much attached to my
</p>
<p>Sovereign, and to the connexion between the two countries, to
</p>
<p>wish to see the instruments of French enterprise, the agents of
</p>
<p>French intrigue, located in every parochial sub-division of the
</p>
<p>country. To this day, Gentlemen, the Government do not dare
</p>
<p>to propose an increase of the grant to the College of Maynooth ;

<p>they do not dare to enlarge the system of enlightened education
</p>
<p>which has been established in this country, and has produced
</p>
<p>such moral and salutary effects. No statesman has courage enough
</p>
<p>to make this proposal; and that fact is an illustration of the po-
</p>
<p>licy by which this country is governed under the auspices of the
</p>
<p>Imperial Parliament. I pass from the year 1808 to 1810, and I beg
</p>
<p>your particular attention to what took place in 1810. A decade had
</p>
<p>then elapsed since the Union. It had been put to the test of a
</p>
<p>searching experiment ; it was known by its fruits. What was the re-
</p>
<p>sult ? The Uuion was the subject of universal complaint among all
</p>
<p>classes of the people of this country. Its degradation was felt, and
</p>
<p>by none more than by the Protestants of Dublin. A requisition was
</p>
<p>signed, not by Catholic agitators, but by twelve of the Grand Jury
</p>
<p>of the City of Dublin, and by one hundred and forty of the freemen
</p>
<p>and freeholders, addressed to the High Sheriff of this city, calling on
</p>
<p>311
</p>
<p>him to summon an aggregate meeting, for the purpose of drawing up
</p>
<p>a petition to Parliament for the Repeal of the Union. Here is the
</p>
<p>requisition : " We, the undersigned, late Quarter Sessions Grand
</p>
<p>" Jurors of the City of Dublin, knowing the distressed and deplorable
</p>
<p>" state of the manufactures of every branch, and the city and nation
</p>
<p> in general, do feel ourselves called upon to point out what we con-
</p>
<p>" ceive the only measure of remedial relief from the general gloom
</p>
<p>** and misery that pervades this unfortunate land, which is to request,
</p>
<p>" and we do hereby request the Sheriff to call a meeting as soon as
</p>
<p>" possible of the freemen and freeholders of this city, to prepare an
</p>
<p>" humble petition to His Majesty, and the Parliament, praying for a
</p>
<p>" Repeal of the Act of Union, as we, in common with all our un-
</p>
<p>11 biassed countrymen, look upon that Act as the root and origin
</p>
<p>" of all our misfortunes.'' That meeting was attended by Daniel
</p>
<p>O'Connell. Gentlemen, it is not my intention, in the course of the
</p>
<p>observations which I mean to make, to direct your attention to the
</p>
<p>speeches of Mr. O'Connell, which have been alluded to on the part
</p>
<p>of the Crown. On the part of the defence, I do not mean to go
</p>
<p>through those voluminous speeches. I should not have strength
</p>
<p>to do so ; and I believe it unnecessary, because the whole of those
</p>
<p>speeches will be before you, and you will have to judge of their
</p>
<p>effects by the whole of their context; to compare their different
</p>
<p>parts ; to consider what is favourable and what is adverse, and
</p>
<p>to endeavour to collect from them whether the intent of the
</p>
<p>traversers, as laid in the indictment, is true. But, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>having told you that it is not my intention to go into a detail
</p>
<p>of those speeches, you will, I hope, excuse me if I should, in draw-
</p>
<p>ing your attention to the speech made by Mr. O'Connell in 1810,
</p>
<p>be particular in my reference to every passage in that speech.
</p>
<p>I will tell you why :  because when that speech was made, no man
</p>
<p>could by possibility have attributed to him the motives which are
</p>
<p>now laid to his charge. No man could say that he entered into a
</p>
<p>conspiracy with the twelve grand jurors, and the hundred and forty
</p>
<p>freeholders, who signed the requisition. That is out of the question.

</p>
<p>Will it not then be an important fact to show you that in lylO, the
</p>
<p>very same language was used, the very same sentiments were expressed
</p>
<p>by Daniel O'Connell, and that the enormous quantity of newspapers
</p>
<p>laid on that table, are nothing else than an expansion of the senti-
</p>
<p>ments and opinions contained in the speech delivered by him in
</p>
<p>1810. If the sentiments of 1810 are the sentiments of 1844, the
</p>
<p>intent of 1844 must be identified with the intent of 1810. The fol-
</p>
<p>lowing is the speech :
</p>
<p>" Mr. O'Connell declared that he offered himself to the meet-
</p>
<p>" ing with unfeigned diffidence. He was unable to do justice to
</p>
<p>" his feelings on the great national subject on which they had
</p>
<p>** met. He felt too much of personal anxiety to allow him to ar-
</p>
<p>" range in anything like order, the many topics which rushed upon
</p>
<p>" his mind, now that, after ten years of silence and torpor, Irish-
</p>
<p>" men again began to recollect their enslaved country. It was
</p>
<p>" a melancholy period, those ten years, a period in which Ireland
</p>
<p>312
</p>
<p>" saw her artificers starved ; her tradesmen begging ; her mer-
</p>
<p>" chants become bankrupts; her gentry banished ; her nobility de-
</p>
<p>" graded. Within that period domestic turbulence broke from day
</p>
<p>" to day into open violence and murder. Religious dissensions were
</p>
<p>" aggravated and embittered. Credit and commerce were annihilated ;
</p>
<p>" taxation augmented in amount and in vexation. Besides the
</p>
<p>" ' hangings off of the ordinary assizes, we had been disgraced by
</p>
<p>" the necessity that existed for holding two special commissions of
</p>
<p>" death, and had been degraded by one rebellion ; and to crown all,
</p>
<p>" we were at length insulted by being told of our growing prosperity.
</p>
<p>" This was not the painting of imagination ; it borrowed nothing
</p>
<p>" from fancy. It was, alas ! the plain representation of the facts
</p>
<p>" that had occurred. The picture in sober colours of the real state
</p>
<p>" of this ill-fated country. There was not a man present but must be
</p>
<p>" convinced that he did not exaggerate a single fact. There was not
</p>
<p>" a man present but must know that more misery existed than he had
</p>
<p>" described. Such being the history of the first ten years of the
</p>
<p>" Union, it would not be difficult to convince any unprejudiced man
</p>
<p>" that all those calamities had sprung from that measure. Ireland
</p>
<p>" was favoured by Providence with a fertile soil, an excellent situa-
</p>
<p>" tion for commerce, intersected by navigable rivers, indented at every
</p>
<p>" side with safe and commodious harbours, blessed with a fruitful
</p>
<p>" soil, and with a vigorous, hardy, generous, and brave population ;
</p>
<p>" how did it happen, then, that the noble qualities of the Irish people
</p>
<p>" were perverted ? That the order of Providence was disturbed, and
</p>
<p>" its blessings worse than neglected ? The fatal cause was obvious,
</p>
<p>" it was the Union. That those deplorable effects would follow
</p>
<p>" from that accursed measure was prophesied. Before the Act of
</p>
<p>" Union passed, it had been already proved that the trade of the
</p>
<p>" country and its credit must fail as capital was drawn from it ; that
</p>
<p>" turbulence and violence would increase when the gentry were re-
</p>
<p>" moved to reside in another country ; that the taxes should increase
</p>
<p>" in the same proportion as the people became unable to pay them !
</p>
<p>" But neither the arguments nor the prophetic fears have ended with

</p>
<p>" our present evils. It has also been demonstrated, that as long as the
</p>
<p>" Union continues, so long must our evils accumulate. The nature
</p>
<p>" of that measure, and the experience of facts which we have now
</p>
<p>" had, leave no doubt of the truth of what has been asserted respect-
</p>
<p>" ing the future ; but, if there be any still uncredulous, he can only
</p>
<p>" be of those who will not submit their reason to authority. To such
</p>
<p>" persons the authority of Mr. Foster, His Majesty's Chancellor of
</p>
<p>" the Exchequer for Ireland, would probably be conclusive, and Mr.
</p>
<p>" Foster has assured us that final ruin to our country must be the
</p>
<p>" consequence of the Union. I will not dwell, Mr. Sheriff, on the
</p>
<p>" miseries of my country ; I am disgusted with the wretchedness the
</p>
<p>" Union has produced, and I do not dare to trust myself with the
</p>
<p>" contemplation of the accumulation of sorrow that must overwhelm
</p>
<p>" the land if the Union be not repealed. I beg to call the attention
</p>
<p>" of the meeting to another part of the subject. The Union, Sir,
</p>
<p>" was a violation of our national and inherent rights ; a flagrant in-
</p>
<p>313
</p>
<p>"justice. The representatives whom we had elected for the short
</p>
<p>" period of eight years had no authority to dispose of their country
</p>
<p>" for ever. It cannot be pretended that any direct or express
</p>
<p>" authority to that effect was given to them, and the nature of
</p>
<p>" their delegation excludes all idea of their having any such by
</p>
<p>" implication. They were the servants of the nation, empowered
</p>
<p>" to consult for its good ; not its masters, to traffic and dispose of
</p>
<p>" it at their fantasy or for their profit. I deny that the nation
</p>
<p>" itself had a right to barter its independence, or to commit political
</p>
<p>" suicide ; but when our servants destroyed our existence as a nation,
</p>
<p>" they added to the baseness of assassination all the guilt of high trea-
</p>
<p>" son. The reasonings upon which those opinions are founded are suf-
</p>
<p>" ficiently obvious. They require no sanction from the authority of
</p>
<p>" any name ; neither do I pretend to give them any weight by de-
</p>
<p>" daring them to be conscientiously my own; but if you want autho-
</p>
<p>" rity to induce the conviction that the Union had injustice for its
</p>
<p>" principle, and a crime for its basis, I appeal to that of His Majesty's
</p>
<p>" present Attorney-General, Mr. Saurin, who, in his place in the
</p>
<p>" Irish parliament, pledged his character as a lawyer and a statesman,
</p>
<p>" that the Union must be a violation of every moral principle, and
</p>
<p>" that it was a mere question of prudence whether it should not be
</p>
<p>u resisted by force. I also appeal to the opinions of the late Lord
</p>
<p>" High Chancellor of Ireland, Mr. George Ponsonby, of the present
</p>
<p>" Solicitor-General, Mr. Bushe, and of that splendid lawyer, Mr.
</p>
<p>" Plunket. The Union was therefore a manifest injustice ; and it
</p>
<p>" continues to be unjust at this day ; it was a crime, and must be
</p>
<p>" still criminal, unless it shall be ludicrously said, that crime, like wine,
</p>
<p>" improves by old age, and that time mollifies injustice into inno-
</p>
<p>" cence. You may smile at the supposition, but in sober sadness
</p>
<p>" you must be convinced that we daily suffer injustice; that every
</p>
<p>" succeeding day adds only another sin to the catalogue of British
</p>
<p>" vice ; and that if the Union continues, it will only make the crime
</p>
<p>" hereditary, and injustice perpetual. We have been robbed, my
</p>
<p>" countrymen, most foully robbed, of our birthright, of our inde-

<p>" pendence ; may it not be permitted us mournfully to ask how this
</p>
<p>" consummation of evil was perfected ? for it was not in any dis-
</p>
<p>" astrous battle that our liberties were struck down ; no foreign in-
</p>
<p>" vader had despoiled the land ; we have not forfeited our country
</p>
<p>" by any crimes; neither did we lose it by any domestic insurrec-
</p>
<p>" tion ; no, the rebellion was completely put down before the Union
</p>
<p>" was accomplished ; the Irish militia and the Irish yeomanry had
</p>
<p>" put it down. How, then, have we become enslaved? Alas! Eng-
</p>
<p>" land, that ought to have been to us a sister and a friend  England,
</p>
<p>" whom we had loved, and fought and bled for  England, whom
</p>
<p>" we have protected, and whom we do protect  England, at a pe-
</p>
<p>u riod when, out of 100,000 of the seamen in her service, 70,000
</p>
<p>" were Irish ; England stole upon us like a thief in the night, and
</p>
<p>" robbed us of the precious gem of our liberty ; she stole from us
</p>
<p>" ' that which in naught enriched her, but made us poor indeed.'
</p>
<p>2s
</p>
<p>314
</p>
<p>" Reflect, then, my friends, on the means employed to effect this
</p>
<p>" disastrous measure. I do not speak of the meaner instruments of
</p>
<p>** bribery and corruption. We all know that everything was put to
</p>
<p>" sale  nothing profane or sacred was omitted in the Union mart.
</p>
<p>** Offices in the revenue, commands in the army and navy, the sacred
</p>
<p>" ermine of justice, and the holy altars of God, were all profaned and
</p>
<p>" polluted as the rewards of Union services. By a vote in favour of
</p>
<p>" the Union, ignorance, incapacity, and profligacy, obtained certain
</p>
<p>" promotion; and our ill-fated, but beloved country, was degraded
</p>
<p>" to her utmost limits before she was transfixed in slavery. But I
</p>
<p>" do not intend to detain you in the contemplation of those vulgar
</p>
<p>" means of parliamentary success  they are within the daily routine
</p>
<p>** of official management ; neither will I direct your attention to the
</p>
<p>" frightful recollection of that avowed fact, which is now part of his-
</p>
<p>" tory, that the rebellion itself was fomented and encouraged in
</p>
<p>" order to facilitate the Union. Even the rebellion was an acci-
</p>
<p>" dental and a secondary cause  the real cause of the Union lay
</p>
<p>" deeper, but is quite obvious  it is to be found at once in the reli-
</p>
<p>" gious dissensions which the enemies of Ireland have created, and
</p>
<p>" continued, and seek to perpetuate amongst themselves, by telling
</p>
<p>" us off, and separating us into wretched sections and miserable sub-
</p>
<p>" divisions ; they separated the Protestant from the Catholic, and
</p>
<p>" the Presbyterians from both ; they revived every antiquated cause
</p>
<p>" of domestic animosity, and invented new pretexts of rancour; but,
</p>
<p>" above all, my countrymen, they belied and calumniated us to each
</p>
<p>" other ; they falsely declared that we hated each other, and they
</p>
<p>" continued to repeat that assertion until we came to believe it ;
</p>
<p>u they succeeded in producing all the madness of party and re-
</p>
<p>" ligious distinctions, and whilst we were lost in the stupor of
</p>
<p>" insanity, they plundered us of our country, and left us to recover at
</p>
<p>" our leisure from the horrid delusion into which we had been so
</p>
<p>" artfully conducted. Such, then, were the means by which the Union
</p>
<p>" was effectuated. It has stripped us of commerce and wealth  it
</p>
<p>' has degraded us, and deprived us not only of our station as a

<p>*' nation, but even of the name of our country  we are governed
</p>
<p>" by foreigners  foreigners make our laws, for were the hundred
</p>
<p>" Members who nominally represent Ireland in what is called the
</p>
<p>" Imperial Parliament  were they really our representatives, what
</p>
<p>" influence could they, although unbought and unanimous, have
</p>
<p>"over the 558 English and Scotch members? But what is the
</p>
<p>" fact ? Why, that out of the hundred, such as they are, that sit
</p>
<p>" for this country, more than one-fifth know nothing of us, and are
</p>
<p>" unknown to us. What, for example, do we know of Andrew
</p>
<p>" Strahan, printer to the King? What can Henry Martin, barrister-
</p>
<p>" at-law, care for the rights and liberties of Irishmen ? Some of
</p>
<p>M us may, perhaps, for our misfortunes, have been compelled to read
</p>
<p>" a verbose pamphlet of James Stevens, but who knows any thing
</p>
<p>" of one Crile, one Hughan, one Cackin, or of a dozen more whose
</p>
<p>" names I could mention, only because I have discovered them for
</p>
<p>315
</p>
<p>" the purpose of speaking to you about tliem ; what sympathy can
</p>
<p>" we in our sufferings expect from those men ? what solicitude for
</p>
<p>"our interests? what are they to Ireland, or Ireland to ihem ?
</p>
<p>" No, Mr. Sheriff, we are not represented; we have no effectual
</p>
<p>,l share in the legislation; the thing is a mere mockery; neither is
</p>
<p>" the Imperial Parliament competent to legislate for us ; it is too un-
</p>
<p>" wieldy a machine to legislate with discernment for England alone;
</p>
<p>" but with respect to Ireland, it has all the additional inconveniences
</p>
<p>" that arise from want of interest and total ignorance. Sir, when I
</p>
<p>" talk of the utter ignorance in Irish affairs of the members of the
</p>
<p>" Imperial Parliament, I do not exaggerate or misstate ; the ministers
</p>
<p>" themselves are in absolute darkness with respect to this country, I
</p>
<p>" undertake to demonstrate it. Sir, they have presumed to speak of
</p>
<p>" the growing prosperity of Ireland ; I know them to be vile and pro-
</p>
<p>" fligate ; I cannot be suspected of flattering them ; yet, vile as they
</p>
<p>" are, I do not believe that they could have had the audacity to in-
</p>
<p>li sert in the speech, supposed to be spoken by His Majesty, that ex-
</p>
<p>u pression, had they known that, in fact, Ireland was in abject and in-
</p>
<p>" creasing poverty. Sir, they were content to take their inforn ation
</p>
<p>" from a pensioned Frenchman, a being styled Sir Francis DTver-
</p>
<p>" nois, who, in one of the pamphlets which it is his trade to write,
</p>
<p>'' has proved by excellent samples of vulgar arithmetic, that our manu-
</p>
<p>" factures are flourishing, our commerce extending, and our felicity
</p>
<p>" consummate. When you detect the ministers themselves in such
</p>
<p>" gross ignorance as, upon such authority, to place an insulting false-
</p>
<p>" hood as it were in the mouth of our revered Sovereign, what think
</p>
<p>"you can be the fitness of nine minor imps of legislation to make
</p>
<p>" laws for Ireland? Indeed, the recent plans of taxation sufficiently
</p>
<p>" evince how incompetent the present scheme of Parliament is to le-
</p>
<p>" gislate for Ireland. Had we an Irish parliament, it is impossible
</p>
<p>' to conceive that they would have adopted taxes at once oppressive
</p>
<p>" and unproductive; ruinous to the country, and useless to the crown.
</p>
<p>" No, Sir, an Irish Parliament, acquainted with the state of the
</p>
<p>" country, and individually interested to tax proper objects, would

<p>" would aid them ; and we should not, as now, perceive taxation
</p>
<p>" unproductive of money, but abundantly fertile in discontent.
</p>
<p>" There is another subject that peculiarly requires the attention of
</p>
<p>" the legislature ; but it is one which can be managed only by a
</p>
<p>" resident and domestic parliament ; it includes everything that re-
</p>
<p>" lates to those strange and portentous disturbances which, from
</p>
<p>" time to time, affright and desolate the fairest districts of the island.
</p>
<p>" It is a delicate, difficult subject, and one that would require the
</p>
<p>" most minute knowledge of the causes that produce those dis-
</p>
<p>" turbances, and would demand all the attention and care of men,
</p>
<p>" whose individual safety was connected with the discovery of a
</p>
<p><l proper remedy. I do not wish to calculate the extent of evil that
</p>
<p>" may be dreaded from the outrages I allude to, if our country shall
</p>
<p>" continue in the hands of foreign empirics and pretenders ; but
</p>
<p>316
</p>
<p>" it is clear to a demonstration that no man can be attached to his
</p>
<p>" King and his country who does not avow the necessity of submitting
</p>
<p>" the control of this political evil to the only competent tribunal  an
</p>
<p>" Irish parliament. The ills of this awful moment are confined to
</p>
<p>"domestic complaints and calamities. The great enemy of the li-
</p>
<p>" berty of the world extends his influence and his power from the
</p>
<p>" Frozen Ocean to the Straits of Gibraltar. He threatens us with inva-
</p>
<p>" sion from the thousand ports of his vast empire ; how is it possible
</p>
<p>" to resist him with an impoverished, divided, and dispirited empire.
</p>
<p>" If then you are loyal to your excellent monarch  if you are attached
</p>
<p>" to the last relic of political freedom  can you hesitate to join in en-
</p>
<p>" deavouring to procure the remedy for all your calamities, the sure
</p>
<p>" protection against all the threats of your enemy, the Repeal of the
</p>
<p>" Union. Yes, restore to Irishmen their country, and you may defy
</p>
<p>" the invader's force ; give back to Ireland her hardy and brave po-
</p>
<p>" pulation, and you have nothing to dread from foreign power. It is
</p>
<p>" useless to detain the meeting longer in detailing the miseries that
</p>
<p>" the Union has produced, or in pointing out the necessity that exists
</p>
<p>" for its Repeal. I have never met any man who did not deplore this
</p>
<p>" fatal measure which has despoiled his country ; nor do I believe
</p>
<p>" there is a single individual in the island who could be found even to
</p>
<p>" pretend approbation of that measure. I would be glad to see the
</p>
<p>" face of the man, or rather of the beast, who would dare to say he
</p>
<p>" thought the Union wise or good ; for the being who could say so
</p>
<p>" must be devoid of all the feelings that distinguish humanity. With
</p>
<p>" the knowledge that such were the sentiments of the universal Irish
</p>
<p>" nation, how does it happen that the Union has lasted for ten years?
</p>
<p>" The solution of the question is easy : the Union continued only
</p>
<p>" because we despaired of its Repeal. Upon this despair alone has
</p>
<p>" it continued ; yet what could be more absurd than such despair ?
</p>
<p>" If the Irish sentiment be but once known, if the voice of six mil-
</p>
<p>" lions be raised from Cape Clear to the Giant's Causeway, if the
</p>
<p>" men most remarkable for their loyalty to their King and attach-
</p>
<p>" ment to constitutional liberty, will come forward as the leaders of

<p>" compare the present probability of repealing the Union with the pros-

<p><; pect that in theyear 1795 existed of that measure being ever brought

<p>" tempt it, and he succeeded ; it only requires the resolution to attempt
</p>
<p>" its repeal : in fact it requires only to entertain the hope of repealing it
</p>
<p>" to make it impossible that the Union should continue; but that
</p>
<p>" pleasing hope could never exist, whilst the infernal dissensions on
</p>
<p>" the score of religion were kept up. The Protestant alone could
</p>
<p>" not expect to liberate his country ; the Roman Catholic alone could
</p>
<p>" not do it ; neither could the Presbyterians ; but amalgamate the

<p>* three into the Irishman, and the Union is repealed. Learn discre-

<p>" the terms of re-enacting the penal code, I declare from my heart,
</p>
<p>" and in the presence of my God, that I would most cheerfully em-

<p>" our wicked and groundless animosities on the altar of our country;
</p>
<p>" let that spirit which heretofore emanating from Dungannon spread

<p>" cherished amongst us ; let us rally round the standard of Old Ireland,

<p>" and we shall easily procure that greatest of political blessings an Irish

</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I think you have found that my statement was
</p>
<p>not incorrect when I stated to you that in 1844 Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>expressed precisely the same opinion as in 1810, and suggested
</p>
<p>that the Repeal of the Union was to be accomplished by the same
</p>
<p>instrumentality. Mr. Riddle, the High Sheriff, was in the chair ;
</p>
<p>but who do you suppose was called to the chair when the High
</p>
<p>Sheriff left it, magnum et venerabile nomen ! Sir Robert Shaw
</p>
<p>having taken the chair, an Address was presented to him as the re-
</p>
<p>presentative of the city of Dublin, to support the prayer of the peti-
</p>
<p>tion, and here is the answer of this conspirator for the dismemberment
</p>
<p>of the empire. He appears to have been embued with all the fell and
</p>
<p>ferocious intents attributed to my client, and to have been connected
</p>
<p>with the alleged conspirators before you in almost every sentiment.
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen,  I feel much obliged for your kind and flatter-
</p>
<p>" ing Address ; it is the greatest possible gratification to me that my
</p>
<p>" public conduct should have met the wishes of so large and so res-
</p>
<p>" pectable a body of my fellow-citizens, as the freemen and freeholders
</p>
<p>" in aggregate meeting duly assembled. Since I have had the honour

</p>
<p>" of being one of your representatives, I have always considered it
</p>
<p>" my duty to attend any meeting of my constituents, legally con-
</p>
<p>" vened, for the purpose of hearing their sentiments ; and 1 thought
</p>
<p>" myself particularly called on to do so on the late occasion, when a
</p>
<p>" question of so much importance to the welfare of the nation was to
</p>
<p>" be agitated. Upon the subject of the Union my sentiments have
</p>
<p>" already been unequivocally avowed ; those sentiments remain un-
</p>
<p>" changed. It is with much satisfaction I contemplate the part I
</p>
<p>" took when the measure was discussed in the Irish parliament, and
</p>
<p>" it cannot but afford me additional pleasure to find that my conduct
</p>
<p>" on that occasion is to this day recollected by you with approbation.
</p>
<p>" With these impressions on my mind, you will, I trust, readily be-
</p>
<p>" lieve me when I assure you that I shall feel sincerely happy in co-
</p>
<p>" operating in all such measures as may be best calculated to forward
</p>
<p>" the object of your petition, consistently with what the interests of
</p>
<p>318
</p>
<p>" Dublin, the general prosperity of Ireland, and the power and sta-
</p>
<p>" bility of the empire may demand.
</p>
<p>" I have the honour to be, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>" Your most obedient and humble Servant,
</p>
<p>" Robert Shaw."
</p>
<p>The next letter bears the name of one of the greatest and best
</p>
<p>men this country ever produced; it is signed "Henry Grattan."
</p>
<p>I have heard it suggested, that after the Union he changed his
</p>
<p>opinion as to the measure. That suggestion is repelled by evi-
</p>
<p>dence which has assumed the rank and dignity of history.
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen,  I have the honour to receive an Address presented
</p>
<p>" by your committee, and an expression of their wishes that I should
</p>
<p>" present certain petitions, and support the Repeal of an Act entitled
</p>
<p>" the Act of Union ; and your committee adds, that it speaks with
</p>
<p>" the authority of my constituency, the freemen and freeholders of
</p>
<p>" the city of Dublin. I beg to assure your committee, and through
</p>
<p>" them my much-beloved and much-respected constituents, that I
</p>
<p>" shall accede to their proposition. I shall present their petitions,
</p>
<p>" and shall support the Repeal of the Act of Union with that de-
</p>
<p>" cided attachment to our connexion with Great Britain, and to
</p>
<p>" that harmony between the two countries, without which the con-
</p>
<p>" nexion cannot last. I do not impair either, as I apprehend, when
</p>
<p>" I assure you that I shall support the Repeal of the Act of Union.
</p>
<p>" You will please to observe, that a proposition of that sort, in par-
</p>
<p>" liament, to be either prudent or possible, must wait till it is called
</p>
<p>" for and backed by the nation. When proposed I shall then  as at
</p>
<p>" all times I hope I shall  prove myself an Irishman, and that Irish-
</p>
<p>" man whose first and last passion was his native country.
</p>
<p>" Henry Grattan."
</p>
<p>" Backed by the nation;"  mark that phrase. It occurs
</p>
<p>again and again in the speeches of Mr. O'Connell. He declares
</p>
<p>again and again that unless backed by the nation, nothing can
</p>
<p>be accomplished by him. And what is the nation ? Ask the Ca-
</p>
<p>tholic, what is the nation ? He will probably tell you the seven

</p>
<p>millions,  the people,  because they are the depository of all political
</p>
<p>power. He is wrong. Ask the Protestant, what is the nation ? He
</p>
<p>will tell you the million and a half who have all the property, who
</p>
<p>enjoy the advantages of education, and the results of education  high
</p>
<p>intelligence and high public spirit, who are united, organized, and
</p>
<p>determined. He is wrong. The nation are neither the Catholics
</p>
<p>nor the Protestants, but both. It was the sustainment of both that
</p>
<p>Mr. Grattan considered indispensable to make the proposition either
</p>
<p>prudent or possible. It was the sustainment of both that Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell demanded at Tara, at Mullaghmast, and at the forty-one meet-
</p>
<p>ings, the details of which you have had before you. Backed by the
</p>
<p>nation ! Those words express a sentiment which no man in this Court
</p>
<p>should blush to avow. If you believe that Mr. O'Connell entertained
</p>
<p>it you cannot find him guilty. If you believe that he meant to carry
</p>
<p>the Repeal of the Union by physical force and by rebellion, you must
</p>
<p>319
</p>
<p>find him guilty ; but if he meant to carry the Repeal of the Union by
</p>
<p>the means which Grattan proposed, you cannot find him guilty. In
</p>
<p>1812, Mr. Percival lost his life, and efforts were made to construct a
</p>
<p>cabinet favourable to emancipation. The project failed. The Ca-
</p>
<p>tholic question at that time occupied the public mind. The Catholic
</p>
<p>Board had commenced its sittings in 1812, and it was determined
</p>
<p>to put it down by a state prosecution. You all remember the trial
</p>
<p>of Sheridan and Kirwan. Mr. Burrowes was the counsel for the
</p>
<p>defendants, and at the outset of his speech, he boldly adverted to
</p>
<p>the fact, that not a single Roman Catholic was on the jury. He spoke
</p>
<p>in the way in which the cause of freedom should ever be advocated.
</p>
<p>He said: " I confess, Gentlemen, I was astonished to find that no
</p>
<p>" Roman Catholic was suffered to enter the box, when it is well
</p>
<p>M known that they equal, if not exceed, Protestant persons upon
</p>
<p>" other occasions ; and when the question relates to privileges of
</p>
<p>" which they claim a participation, and you possess a monopoly.
</p>
<p>" I was astonished to see twenty-two Roman Catholic persons, of
</p>
<p>" the highest respectability, set aside by the arbitrary veto of the
</p>
<p>" Crown, without any alleged insufficiency, upon the sole demerit
</p>
<p>'* of suspected liberality. I was astonished to find a juror pressed
</p>
<p>* into that box who did not deny that he was a sworn Orange-
</p>
<p>" man, and another who was about to admit, until he was silenced,
</p>
<p>" that he had prejudged the cause. Those occurrences, at the first
</p>
<p>" aspect of them, filled me with unqualified despair. I do not say
</p>
<p>" that the Crown lawyers have had any concern in this revolting pro-
</p>
<p>M cess, but I will say that they ought to have interfered in counter-
</p>
<p>" acting a selection which has insulted some of the most loyal men of
</p>
<p>" this city, and must disparage any verdict which may be thus pro-
</p>
<p>" cured. But, Gentlemen, upon a nearer view of the subject, I relin-
</p>
<p>" quish the despair by which I was actuated. I rest my hopes upon
</p>
<p>" your known integrity, your deep interest in the welfare of the
</p>
<p>" country, and the very disgust which yourselves must feel at the
</p>
<p>" manner and motive of your array. You did not press forward into
</p>
<p>" that jury-box ; you did not seek the exclusion, the total exclusion of

</p>
<p>" any Roman Catholic ; you, no doubt, would anxiously desire an
</p>
<p>" intermixture of some of those enlightened Roman Catholics whom
</p>
<p>" the Attorney-General declared he was certain he could convince,
</p>
<p>" but whom he has not ventured to address in that box. The painful
</p>
<p>" responsibility cast upon you is not of your own wishing, and I per-
</p>
<p>" suade myself you will, on due reflection, feel more indisposed to
</p>
<p>" those who court and influence your prejudices, and would involve
</p>
<p>" you in an act of deep responsibility, without that fair intermixture
</p>
<p>" of opposite feelings and interest, which, by inviting discussion, and
</p>
<p>u balancing affections, would promise a moderate and respected deci-
</p>
<p>" sion, than towards me, who openly attack your prejudices, and strive
</p>
<p>" to arm your consciences against them. You know as well as I do,
</p>
<p>" that prejudice is a deadly enemy to fair investigation  that it has
</p>
<p>" neither eyes nor ears for justice ; that it hears and sees everything
</p>
<p>" on one side : that, to refute it is to exasperate it ; and that, when it
</p>
<p>320
</p>
<p>" predominates, accusation is received as evidence, and calumny pro-
</p>
<p>" duces conviction." It might, at first, be supposed that a Protestant
</p>
<p>jury would take this language in bad part; but they gave Mr. Bur-
</p>
<p>rovves credit for his manly frankness, and they acquitted the traver-
</p>
<p>sers. Mr. Saurin was then Attorney-General. Whatever may have
</p>
<p>been his faults, hypocrisy was not among them. He was of opinion
</p>
<p>that Protestant ascendancy, in every department of the State, was
</p>
<p>necessary for its salvation. He thought that it should predominate
</p>
<p>not only at the Castle, but in those public tribunals which are armed
</p>
<p>with so much authority, and exercise so much influence over the for-
</p>
<p>tunes of the state. He did not deny, he scorned to deny the impu-
</p>
<p>tation. He had his faults, but he had also many virtues. I remember
</p>
<p>him well, he was meek in prosperity, and in adverse fortune he was
</p>
<p>serene. To the last the lustre of adversity shone in his smile; for his
</p>
<p>faults, such as they were, his name, in an almost inevitable inheritance
</p>
<p>of antipathy, furnishes an excuse. How much more noble was his con-
</p>
<p>duct, and the conduct of the Government of the day, than if they had
</p>
<p>been profuse of professions which they never meant to realise, and
</p>
<p>had offered an insult to the understanding, as well as a gross wrong
</p>
<p>to the rights of Irish people, by telling them that no difference was
</p>
<p>to be made between Catholic and Protestant ! and yet I shall not
</p>
<p>be surprised if, notwithstanding all that has happened, the same cant
</p>
<p>of impartiality shall be persevered in, and if we shall hear the same
</p>
<p>protestations of solicitude to make no distinction between Protes-
</p>
<p>tant and Catholic, especially in the administration of the law. The
</p>
<p>screen falls, the "little French milliner" is disclosed, "by all that's
</p>
<p>horrible, Lady Teazle," yet Joseph preserves his self-possession, and
</p>
<p>deals in sentiment to the last. But if, after all that has befallen,
</p>
<p>my Lord Eliot shall continue to deal in sentimentality, the ex-
</p>
<p>clamation of the unfortunate Sir Peter Teazle, "oh! damn your sen-
</p>
<p>timent," will break in upon him on every side. Notwithstanding the
</p>
<p>acquittal of Sheridan and Kirwan on the first trial, a second prosecu-
</p>
<p>tion was instituted, and a conviction was obtained. What good to the
</p>
<p>country was effected by it ? Was it sanctioned by the public? Was it

</p>
<p>ratified in the tribunal of public opinion, to which, after all, an appeal
</p>
<p>must ever be made? Was the Catholic spirit, was the spirit of the
</p>
<p>public subdued? Was the agitation put an end to? No. Sir Ro-
</p>
<p>bert Peel came to this country in 1813. He was an Irish Member,
</p>
<p>and had been returned for Cashel, where a small but discriminating
</p>
<p>constituency, could appreciate the merits of the future Minister
</p>
<p>of England. It has been said, that statesmen who are destined
</p>
<p>to operate in England, are sent to dissect in Ireland. Mr. Peel
</p>
<p>had the finest instruments, a nice and dexterous hand, and gave
</p>
<p>proof that he would give the least possible pain in any amputa-
</p>
<p>tions which he might afterwards have to perform. He was de-
</p>
<p>corous ; he avoided the language of wanton insult ; he endeavour-
</p>
<p>ed to establish a mild despotism here, and to unite moderation
</p>
<p>with absolute power. He gave us no offence ; he dealt in " de-
</p>
<p>cencies for ever." But still the agitation continued. He must
</p>
<p>321
</p>
<p>have seen the irresistible argument in favour of Emancipation,
</p>
<p>but he hail not the moral courage, the quality in which he is
</p>
<p>mainly deficient, to break from his party and concede at once
</p>
<p>that which he was at last compelled to concede. A new policy
</p>
<p>was adopted after Mr. l'eel had returned to England, and the nota-
</p>
<p>ble expedient was adopted of counteracting the Secretary by the
</p>
<p>Lord Lieutenant, and the Lord Lieutenant by the Secretary. We
</p>
<p>had Grant against Talbot, and Wellesley against Goulburn, and it was
</p>
<p>expected that from this complication of policy good results would
</p>
<p>flow. The Roman Catholics of Ireland had been led to entertain
</p>
<p>the hope that something would be done for their relief. But their
</p>
<p>eyes were opened, and they at length discovered that they could
</p>
<p>rely on themselves alone for the accomplishment of Emancipation.
</p>
<p>Daniel O'Connell, in the year 1821, founded the Catholic Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation. He constructed a vast engine by which public opinion
</p>
<p>was to be worked ; he formed with singular skill the smallest wheels
</p>
<p>of the complicated machinery, and he put the whole in motion by
</p>
<p>the current of eloquence which flowed, as if from a hot-well, from his
</p>
<p>soul. The people were organized  the middle classes, the Catholic
</p>
<p>clergy, the Catholic aristocracy, were combined. The Minister
</p>
<p>determined to put down the Catholic Association, and in 1825, a
</p>
<p>bill was brought in for the suppression of it. Mr. O'Connell pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to London in the hope that by making a tender of just
</p>
<p>concession, he might be able to avert the measure by which such an
</p>
<p>infraction of liberty was threatened. He offered to connect the
</p>
<p>State with the Catholic Church,  he was dismissed with scorn and
</p>
<p>contumely. The bill was passed for the suppression of the Catholic
</p>
<p>Association ; the bill was laughed to scorn, and proved utterly in-
</p>
<p>operative. Mr. O'Connell was not dismayed, his energy redoubled ;
</p>
<p>the peasantry were taught that the elective franchise was not a trust
</p>
<p>vested in the tenant for the benefit of the landlord. A severance
</p>
<p>took place between landlord and tenant, which I regret, and shall
</p>
<p>always regret, but for which those who delayed justice so long are
</p>
<p>alone responsible. A great agrarian revolt took place. The Beres-

<p>fords were beaten in Waterford, the Fosters in Louth, and at length
</p>
<p>the Clare election gave demonstration of a moral power whose ex-
</p>
<p>istence had scarcely been conjectured. I remember standing near
</p>
<p>the late Lord Fitzgerald, an accomplished and enlightened man, when
</p>
<p>he looked down from the hustings on a mass of sixty thousand sober
</p>
<p>men  I remember to have heard him say, that he wished that Welling-
</p>
<p>ton and Peel could look on the spectacle which he then beheld. He
</p>
<p>saw that somethingfarmoreimportant than his return to Parliament was
</p>
<p>at stake. Catholic Emancipation was carried, and here let me put two
</p>
<p>questions to you. The first is, whether in the twenty-nine years
</p>
<p>which I have traversed as rapidly as I could, you have had abun-
</p>
<p>dant proof of the beneficial results of the Union. Do you think up
</p>
<p>to the 13th of April, 1829, the flay on which the Royal assent was
</p>
<p>given to the Catholic Relief Bill, the system of government insti-
</p>
<p>tuted and carried on under the auspices of the Imperial Parliament,
</p>
<p>was so wise, so just, so salutary, so fraught with advantage to the
</p>
<p>2t
</p>
<p>322
</p>
<p>country, so conducive to its tranquillization, and to the development
</p>
<p>of its resources, that for twenty nine-years the Union ought to have
</p>
<p>been regarded as a great legislative blessing to this country. The
</p>
<p>next question is more important. Take up this indictment, substitute
</p>
<p>" Catholic Emancipation" for Repeal, and you will find that in 1829,
</p>
<p>if the Attorney-General had been directed to prosecute for a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy those who carried Catholic Emancipation, every count in the
</p>
<p>indictment would have been applicable, and evidence of, exactly the
</p>
<p>same description might have been brought forward for the purpose
</p>
<p>of sustaining it. Editors of newspapers were members of the Catho-
</p>
<p>lic Association, Mr. Staunton, the respectable proprietor of the
</p>
<p>Weekly Register, was a member of it. His newspaper was sent
</p>
<p>through the country. He stood exactly in the same relation with
</p>
<p>regard to the Catholic Association as Dr. Gray and Mr. Barrett
</p>
<p>stand to the Repeal Association. He will be produced to you on
</p>
<p>that table, and he will prove that he never got one farthing from the
</p>
<p>Catholic Association, except for advertisements, and for the space
</p>
<p>occupied in his columns, and nothing else. Mr. Conway and Mr.
</p>
<p>Barrett were members of the Catholic Association. The regulations
</p>
<p>of the Catholic Association were much the same as those of the
</p>
<p>Repeal Association. Monster meetings were held as they are
</p>
<p>now. You all remember the provincial meetings which were
</p>
<p>attended by fifty, sixty, and a hundred thousand men. They col-
</p>
<p>lected money as they do now ; money came from America and
</p>
<p>Canada, and strong sympathy for Catholic Ireland was expressed.
</p>
<p>In 1828 and 1829 England was threatened with a war. Russia had
</p>
<p>passed the Balkan. M. de Chateaubriand in the French House of
</p>
<p>Deputies, adverted to the speeches in the Catholic Association, and
</p>
<p>used language of minacious intimation towards England. What
</p>
<p>would have been thought of an indictment for a conspiracy against
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, against the Evening Post, the Freeman's Journal,
</p>
<p>the Morning Register, Dr. Doyle, and my friend Tom Steele, who
</p>
<p>was at that time, as he is now, a knight errant animated by a noble
</p>
<p>chivalry against oppression in every form ? Seditious speeches were

</p>
<p>not passed over at that time. The humble individual who addresses
</p>
<p>you was prosecuted for having made a speech on the expedition of
</p>
<p>Wolfe Tone. But it was not an indictment for conspiracy. The
</p>
<p>Crown sought to make me responsible for what I said myself, not
</p>
<p>for what was said and done by others. The bills were found. But
</p>
<p>Mr. Canning was then in office, and he said openly in the Cabinet:
</p>
<p>" I have read the speech which is the subject of the prosecution.
</p>
<p>" There is not a sentence in it which would justify a call to order
</p>
<p>" in the House of Commons. The prosecution is unjust, and must
</p>
<p>" be abandoned"  and the prosecution was abandoned. Why do I
</p>
<p>refer to this? For two reasons: First, because I am, thanks be to
</p>
<p>God, as innocent as you, or any living man of the monstrous charge
</p>
<p>then preferred against me,  and in the next place, to show you the
</p>
<p>manly mode of dealing of the Government of that day. There was no
</p>
<p>attempt to involve me with others ; if there had been such an attempt,
</p>
<p>I know not what would have been my fate. Have a care how you make
</p>
<p>323
</p>
<p>a precedent in favour of such an indictment. During the last nine
</p>
<p>months the Attorney General had ample opportunities, if his own
</p>
<p>statement be well-founded, of instituting prosecutions against
</p>
<p>individuals, for what they themselves had spoken, written, and
</p>
<p>done. In this proceeding, whose tardiness indicates its intent,
</p>
<p>you will not, I feel confident, become his auxiliaries. A Coercion
</p>
<p>Bill, if the agitation for a Repeal of the Union is to be put down,
</p>
<p>would be preferable, for it operates only as a temporary suspension
</p>
<p>of liberty ; but the effects of a verdict are permanently deleterious.
</p>
<p>The doctrine of conspiracy may be applied to every combination of
</p>
<p>every kind. It is directed against the Repeal Association to-day : it
</p>
<p>may be levelled against the Anti-Corn-Law League to-morrow. In
</p>
<p>one word, every political society, no matter how diversified their ob-
</p>
<p>jects, or how different their constitution, is within its reach.
</p>
<p>Pass to the events which followed Emancipation. The Eman-
</p>
<p>cipation Bill is carried. The Tories are put out by their former Irish
</p>
<p>auxiliaries. The Whigs came in, and the Reform Bill is proposed.
</p>
<p>How was it carried ? You heard the Attorney-General read a speech
</p>
<p>of Lord John Russell's respecting the Repeal of the Union. You
</p>
<p>have heard him refer to the authority of Lord Grey. Let us see how
</p>
<p>the Reform Bill was carried. One hundred and fifty thousand men
</p>
<p>assembled at Birmingham. They threatened to advance on London.
</p>
<p>Lord Althorpe and Lord John Russell entered into a correspondence
</p>
<p>with them. A resolution not to pay taxes is entered into, and ap-
</p>
<p>plauded by Lord Fitzwilliam ; Cumber is reduced to ashes; Bristol
</p>
<p>is on fire. The Lords hesitate. With one blow of the prerogative
</p>
<p>the Whig Premier strikes them down. And who were the men  the
</p>
<p>bold and audacious men  conspirators indeed ! who embarked in an
</p>
<p>enterprize so fearful, and which could only be accomplished by such
</p>
<p>fearful means  Lord Grey? Yes. Lord John Russell? Yes.
</p>
<p>Lord Althorpe ? Yes. You remember the question put by Mr.
</p>
<p>Hatchell to one of the witnesses, Mr. Ross, whether he knew Sir
</p>
<p>James Graham? I do not wonder that the Attorney-General started
</p>
<p>up and threw his buckler over the Secretary for the Home Depart-

</p>
<p>ment. Gentlemen of the Jury, this prosecution came from the Home
</p>
<p>Office. This country is under the direction of the Home Office. It was
</p>
<p>stated by Sir Robert Peel, in Parliament, that for every proceeding in
</p>
<p>this country the Home Office is responsible. Gamblers denounce dice !
</p>
<p>drunkards denounce debauch ! against immorality let wenchers rail,
</p>
<p>when Graham denounces agitation ! I do not speak in a spirit of par-
</p>
<p>tizanship when I say this. I do not say that Sir James Graham, when
</p>
<p>he changed his party, did not do so from disinterested motives. I am
</p>
<p>willing to admit that his sentiments were conscientious. I will not at-
</p>
<p>tack behind his back the man whom I have so often attacked to his
</p>
<p>face, but this I will say : the Attorney General, when he bore in mind
</p>
<p>tho political part taken by his master in passing the Reform Bill,
</p>
<p>should have been more forbearing in his observations on the acts of
</p>
<p>Daniel O'Connell. The Reform Bill is passed. The Reformed
</p>
<p>Parliament is summoned. What is the first measure adopted by the
</p>
<p>Imperial Reformed Parliament ? The very first measure adopted is
</p>
<p>324
</p>
<p>the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, the Coercion Bill, by
</p>
<p>which a jury, composed of twelve soldiers, are sent with a sort of mi-
</p>
<p>litary roving commission to try the offences committed in the dis-
</p>
<p>turbed districts in Ireland. But a Coercion Bill was better than a
</p>
<p>State Prosecution. It is only a temporary suspension of liberty, with
</p>
<p>its operation limited to a particular period, and when that period is
</p>
<p>elapsed there is an end to the Act of Parliament, and liberty revives.
</p>
<p>But a verdict, a verdict founded on the perversion of law, on the sub-
</p>
<p>tilization of law, a verdict not consistent with the high principles of the
</p>
<p>constitution stands as a precedent. The Act of Parliament inflicts a
</p>
<p>gash, the verdict inflicts a mortal wound. Gentlemen of the Jury, I will
</p>
<p>not go into a detail of the rest of that series of calamitous measures
</p>
<p>which have kept this country in a state of destitution and misery to the
</p>
<p>present hour. The Church Temporalities Bill, the Tithe Bill, the Mu-
</p>
<p>nicipal Bill, the Registration Bill. These questions, with their diversi-
</p>
<p>fied ramifications, have left us not a moment's rest ; cabinets have been
</p>
<p>destroyed by them ; the great parties in the state have fought for them,
</p>
<p>and Ireland has supplied the fatal field for the encounter of contending
</p>
<p>factions. No single measure for the substantial and permanent ame-
</p>
<p>lioration of the country has been adopted, and here we are, at the
</p>
<p>opening of a new Session of Parliament, with a Poor Rate on our
</p>
<p>estates, an English tariff in our markets, and a state prosecution in Her
</p>
<p>Majesty's Court of Queen's Bench. Do you not think, Gentlemen of
</p>
<p>the Jury, that I have made out my case to a certain extent, and es-
</p>
<p>tablished that the policy pursued by the Imperial Parliament, in re-
</p>
<p>gard to this country, whether by Whigs or Tories, I make no dis-
</p>
<p>tinction, has been productive of consequences seriously injurious
</p>
<p>to the country. I do not know of what politics you may be.
</p>
<p>I do not know whether any one of you are advocates for the Repeal
</p>
<p>of the Union. You may be of opinion that a Repeal of the Union
</p>
<p>would lead to a rupture between the Parliaments of the two coun-
</p>
<p>tries, and to a consequent dismemberment of the empire. It might
</p>
<p>not be attended with all the beneficial results which its advocates an-
</p>
<p>ticipate from it, but still the discussion of it may not be useless.

</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, if the councils of the State were governed
</p>
<p>by no other motive or consideration than those of justice ; if mea-
</p>
<p>sures were founded upon syllogisms; if government, was a matter of
</p>
<p>pure dialectics, then all assemblages of the people should, of course,
</p>
<p>be deprecated, and every exciting adjuration addressed to the pas-
</p>
<p>sions of the people should be strenuously reproved. But you may
</p>
<p>carry on a ratiocination with a Minister for one hundred years, and
</p>
<p>not advance a single step. The agitator must sometimes follow the
</p>
<p>example of the diplomatist, who asks for every thing, in order that
</p>
<p>something may be obtained ; and you may rely on it, that when Mi-
</p>
<p>nisters are most loud in their complaints against agitation, they gene-
</p>
<p>rally have in contemplation some measure of conciliation. For
</p>
<p>example, we are indebted to agitation for the Landlord and Tenant
</p>
<p>Commission, which Conservatives think will disturb the foundation of
</p>
<p>property, and against which, Lord Brougham addressed his admoni-
</p>
<p>tory deprecation to Sir Robert Peel. For my own part, I think
</p>
<p>325
</p>
<p>it may lead to results greater than were contemplated, for it appears
</p>
<p>to me to have been chiefly intended as a means of diverting public at-
</p>
<p>tention from the consideration of the other great grievances of the
</p>
<p>country. The main source of all these grievances, I am convinced,
</p>
<p>is to be found in the colonial policy pursued towards Ireland.
</p>
<p>The Union was never carried into effect. If it bad, Ireland would
</p>
<p>not be a miserable dependant in the great imperial family. One of
</p>
<p>the charges brought forward by the Attorney General against the
</p>
<p>traversers was, that at Mullaghmast they used a motto taken
</p>
<p>from the Morning Chronicle: "Nine millions of people cannot be
</p>
<p>dragged at the tail of any nation on earth." If this sentiment be
</p>
<p>seditious, I am sorry for it, it is one in which I concur, and I do not
</p>
<p>hesitate to express my concurrence in it in the Court of Queen's
</p>
<p>Bench. I do not attach any great value to mere numbers. To vast
</p>
<p>multitudes apart from moral weight, I attach no value ; bulthe moral
</p>
<p>aspect of the people of this country has, within the last hundred
</p>
<p>years, undergone extraordinary changes. Education, that great cir-
</p>
<p>culator of political sentiment, has been extensively diffused among
</p>
<p>us. Ireland, if I may so speak, has undergone a species of transfor-
</p>
<p>mation. By one who had seen her half a century ago, she would
</p>
<p>scarcely be recognized. The simultaneous, miraculous abandon-
</p>
<p>ment of that pernicious habit to which the nation was addicted,
</p>
<p>effected by one man, I do not go so far as to say, is to be
</p>
<p>regarded as evidence of the great and powerful political organization
</p>
<p>of the people of this country, but it is a strong indication of what
</p>
<p>might be done by a good Government with so fine a people; and it
</p>
<p>is a change of which a great statesman might avail himself for the ad-
</p>
<p>vantage of the country. The great literary organ of the Whig party
</p>
<p>has recently suggested many bold measures, which it represents as
</p>
<p>necessary to Ireland. There are numerous difficulties connected with
</p>
<p>some of the propositions to which I refer, but there is one which I
</p>
<p>think deserves serious attention, and which I consider rational and
</p>
<p>feasible ; nothing is rational which is not feasible. It is suggested
</p>
<p>that the Imperial Parliament should sit here for two months be-

</p>
<p>fore (he month of February, every year, for the discharge of Irish
</p>
<p>business alone ; and that the Imperial business should be afterwards
</p>
<p>transacted in the great metropolis of the British Empire. I see
</p>
<p>no difficulty in this. No objection could then arise from the great
</p>
<p>departments of the State, and all their machinery, being located
</p>
<p>in London, for during the Irish Session, a reference to them would
</p>
<p>not be required. It might be inconvenient for English members
</p>
<p>to come here, but, believe me, the state of things going on in
</p>
<p>this country the agitation and distraction which exist in it, and the
</p>
<p>consequences of this State prosecution  whatever may be its result,
</p>
<p>conviction or no conviction  are attended with inconveniences far
</p>
<p>greater than any which English members, in crossing the Irish channel,
</p>
<p>would encounter. The benefits to Ireland, which would be derived
</p>
<p>from such a plan, no body can doubt. It would have the advantages
</p>
<p>without the dangers of a Repeal of the Union. There would be
</p>
<p>326
</p>
<p>no dismemberment of the Empire ; no Catholic ascendancy to be
</p>
<p>dreaded ; no predominance of one party over the other. The inter-
</p>
<p>course of the two countries would be augmented to such an extent,
</p>
<p>that their feelings would be identified; national prejudices would be
</p>
<p>reciprocally laid aside ; English capital would be diffused through
</p>
<p>Ireland ; an English domestication would take place. Instead of
</p>
<p>lending money on Irish mortgages, Englishmen would buy lands
</p>
<p>in Ireland, and live on them. The absentee drain would be
</p>
<p>diminished. The value of property would be nearly doubled :
</p>
<p>public works would be undertaken ; and the natural endow-
</p>
<p>ments of the country wonld be turned to account. You would see
</p>
<p>the country again inhabited by its ancient nobility. What a magnifi-
</p>
<p>cent spectacle this city would then present ! Its ancient splendour
</p>
<p>would be renovated ; your streets would again be shaken by the roll
</p>
<p>of the gorgeous equipages in which the first nobles of the country
</p>
<p>would be borne to the Senate House, from which the money-changers
</p>
<p>would be driven. The mansions of your aristocracy would blaze
</p>
<p>again with that useful luxury which contributes, by the affluence
</p>
<p>of the rich, to the employment and the comfort of the poor; and
</p>
<p>this metropolis, the seat of a nation's legislature, would not be
</p>
<p>deemed unworthy to be the abode of Majesty itself. You would
</p>
<p>behold your Queen among you proceeding to the Parliament,
</p>
<p>with the diadem, the brightest in the world, glittering on her
</p>
<p>brow, while her countenance beamed with that expression which
</p>
<p>becomes her better than the Crown itself. We should see her
</p>
<p>accompanied by the Prince, of whom it is the highest praise to
</p>
<p>say, that he has proved himself to be not unworthy of her. We
</p>
<p>should see her encompassed by all the circumstances which associate
</p>
<p>endearment with respect. We should not only behold the Queen,
</p>
<p>but the mother and the wife ; and see her from the highest station
</p>
<p>on which a human being can be placed, presenting to her subjects the
</p>
<p>model of every conjugal and maternal virtue. I do not speak in the
</p>
<p>language of enthusiasm when I say that this anticipation might be
</p>
<p>realized ; but if, instead of co-operating for such a purpose as

</p>
<p>this, we continue our fierce dissensions, what hope will be left for the
</p>
<p>country? If you, Gentlemen, instead of assisting in an undertaking
</p>
<p>so reasonable and so safe, shall conspire with her Majesty's Attorney-
</p>
<p>General in crushing the men who have had the boldness to complain
</p>
<p>of the grievances of their country, you will lay Ireland prostrate.
</p>
<p>You may strike agitation dumb ; you may make millions of mutes ; I
</p>
<p>admit it ; but beware of that dreary silence, which is darkly significant
</p>
<p>of the fearful purpose which it awaits its opportunity to accomplish.
</p>
<p>Beware of contributing to those incidents of horror which every good
</p>
<p>man will pray may be averted, and which will be lamented when re-
</p>
<p>pentance shall be, like that of those who are for ever doomed, whose
</p>
<p>sorrow is unavailing, and whose contrition is vain.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I am far from meaning to say that strong
</p>
<p>language is not reprehensible, and has not been used ; butl deny that
</p>
<p>those speeches bear, when taken together, the interpretation put upon
</p>
<p>327
</p>
<p>them. Gentlemen, I do not recollect, and I am sorry to say I have had
</p>
<p>some experience in that way, an instance of any popular movement in
</p>
<p>which such language has not been used. If any of you have taken the
</p>
<p>trouble of reading the speeches at the Ant i- Corn- Law League, you have
</p>
<p>read language of a character more exciting and inflammatory than any
</p>
<p>which has been proved before you. I grieved to hear the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General say that Her Majesty wasspoken of in terms of personal disres-
</p>
<p>pect at one of these meetings. I heard him say that the Queen was
</p>
<p>spoken of as one would speak of a fishwoman. I will not attribute
</p>
<p>misrepresentation to any man, but this I must say, that it was one of
</p>
<p>the most infelicitous expressions which a public officer could be guilty
</p>
<p>of. Mr. John O'Connell proposed the health of the Queen at Mul-
</p>
<p>laghmast, and added that the speech delivered by the Queen was the
</p>
<p>speech of her Ministers, and could not be considered as the emana-
</p>
<p>tion of her own unbiassed mind. On every occasion on which the
</p>
<p>the speech of Her Majesty was alluded to the distinction was taken
</p>
<p>between the Queen and her Ministers. My client's speech at
</p>
<p>Mullaghmast was given in evidence. It is strong in expressions
</p>
<p>of enthusiasm and affection to Her Majesty. Will the Attorney-Ge-
</p>
<p>neral deny  is it not notorious to every body that the speech from
</p>
<p>the throne is regarded as the speech from the minister?  that the
</p>
<p>minister alone is responsible for it ? I say it is unfair, it is illegiti-
</p>
<p>mate to impute to the traversers, in open Court, an offence so mon-
</p>
<p>strous without giving better proof of it than this. Gentlemen, how
</p>
<p>is it that the Tories speak of Her Majesty ? You cannot have for-
</p>
<p>gotten the contumelies heaped upon the head of the Queen, on the
</p>
<p>resignation, in 1839, of Sir Robert Peel. I will not, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>disgust you by a more distinct reference to those traitorous orgies
</p>
<p>in which even clergymen took part. It is better to inquire how it is
</p>
<p>that gentlemen connected with these very prosecutions have thought it
</p>
<p>decorous to comport themselves when their own passions were excited.
</p>
<p>I shall not weary you with numerous extracts, but such as I shall give
</p>
<p>you I think you will admit are of a peculiar kind, and not destitute of
</p>
<p>interest. The first speech I shall give you is extracted from the Even-

<p>ing Mail of the 9th of March, 1835. I believe it is taken from a report
</p>
<p>of the proceedings at a meeting at Exeter Hall, on an exceedingly
</p>
<p>interesting subject, the National Education Board, of which the
</p>
<p>Solicitor-General, I believe, is one of the Commissioners. I will not
</p>
<p>ask the Attorney-General what he thinks of this speech, because it
</p>
<p>refers to a subject somewhat embarrassing to him : what his opinions
</p>
<p>are on the Education question it is not easy to conjecture, and it is
</p>
<p>not for me to scrutinize. The following extract is one of no ordi-
</p>
<p>nary interest, and I defy the Crown to produce any thing like it in
</p>
<p>the speeches of the Repealers : " The Government might make
</p>
<p>" what regulation it pleased ; but he trusted the people knew their
</p>
<p>" duty too well to submit to its enactments. It might degrade our
</p>
<p>" mitres; it might deprive us of our properties; but if the Govern-
</p>
<p>" ment dared to lay its hand on the Bible, then we must come to an
</p>
<p>" issue. We will cover it with our bodies. My friends, will you
</p>
<p>u permit your brethren to call out to you in vain ? In the name of
</p>
<p>328
</p>
<p>" my country, and my country's God, I will appeal from a British
</p>
<p>" House of Commons to a British people. My countrymen would
</p>
<p>" obey the laws so long as they were properly administered ; but if
</p>
<p>" it were sought to lay sacrilegious hands on the Bible, to tear the
</p>
<p>" standard of the living God, and to raise a mutilated one in its stead,
</p>
<p>" then it would be no time to halt between two opinions  then, in
</p>
<p>" every hill and valley would resound the rallying cry of ' To your
</p>
<p>" tents, oh Israel.'" That speech was delivered by the Right Hon.
</p>
<p>Frederick Shaw, who still lends his efficient support to Her Majesty's
</p>
<p>Government, the mutilators of the Word of God. But the next
</p>
<p>incident is still more interesting, a still greater person is to be intro-
</p>
<p>duced on the scene. In the year 1837 a great Protestant meeting
</p>
<p>was held by gentlemen who had a right to hold that meeting, but
</p>
<p>who have no right to complain of others following their example.
</p>
<p>The meeting was held in the Mansion House, in the city of Dublin.
</p>
<p>It was attended by almost all the representatives of the Conservative
</p>
<p>interest in the country. On the motion of Sir Robert Shaw, who
</p>
<p>was in the chair at the meeting in 1810, to which I have just now
</p>
<p>adverted, Lord Downshire was called to the chair. I shall advert
</p>
<p>to one or two of the speeches, as reported in the Evening Packet
</p>
<p>of the 14th of January, 1837. The Earl of Charleville said, "Well,
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen, you have a rebellions Parliament, vou have a Lord
</p>
<p>" Lieut enant the slave and minion of the rebellious Parliament." The
</p>
<p>Attorney-General was present when these words were used  did he
</p>
<p>remonstrate? Did he expostulate? Could not Lord Charleville, The
</p>
<p>Right Honourable Thomas Berry Cusack Smith, and the Editor of the
</p>
<p>Packet have been indicted for a conspiracy ? Not only he did not re-
</p>
<p>monstrate, but he made a speech, in which he stated, that "he was sorry
</p>
<p>" to find that the Roman Catholic members of Parliament paid so little
</p>
<p>" regard to their oaths." When the Right Hon. gentleman used
</p>
<p>those expressions, I am not surprised that Roman Catholics were
</p>
<p>struck off the jury. Let him not misapprehend me, I do not refer
</p>
<p>to his language in the spirit of resentment. Resentment is the last
</p>
<p>sentiment which such expressions are calculated to produce. I refer

<p>to these expressions solely for the purpose of showing how men who
</p>
<p>have their prepossessions and feelings most under restraint, may be
</p>
<p>betrayed into indiscreet expressions, but they should be the least
</p>
<p>disposed to find fault with those, who, feeling a deep interest in the wel-
</p>
<p>fare of their country, may be betrayed into a violation of discretion,
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General has expressed great indignation at the re-
</p>
<p>ferences made at Mullaghmast, to transactions over which the veil of
</p>
<p>oblivion ought to be drawn. He said, and justly said, that men
</p>
<p>should not grope in the annals of their country, for the purpose of
</p>
<p>disinterring those events, whose resuscitation can but appal and scare
</p>
<p>us. How does he reconcile that position with his having been himself a
</p>
<p>party to a resolution passed at the meeting of which I am speaking,
</p>
<p>in which it is stated that the condition of the Protestants of Ireland
</p>
<p>was as alarming as it was in the year 1641, when events took place
</p>
<p>from whose recollection the imagination turns with horror and dis-
</p>
<p>may. Gentlemen, monster meetings are not exclusively Catholic.

</p>
<p>A meeting was held in Cavan. In the Appendix to the Report of the
</p>
<p>Committee on Orange Lodges, of the 12th ofNovember, 1834, I find
</p>
<p>this passage : " And, lastly, we would beg to call the attention of the
</p>
<p>" Lodge, and through them return our heartfelt thanks and congra-
</p>
<p>" tulations to our brethren through the various parts of Ireland, who,
</p>
<p>" it) the meetings of three thousand in Dublin, four thousand at Ban-
</p>
<p>" don, thirty thousand at Cavan, and seventy-five thousand at Hills-
</p>
<p>" borough, by their strength of numbers, the rank, the respectability,
</p>
<p>" and orderly conduct of their attendance, the manly and eloquent
</p>
<p>" expression of every Christian and loyal sentiment, vindicated so
</p>
<p>" nobly the character of our institution against the aspersion thrown
</p>
<p>" on it, as the ' paltry remnant of a faction.' " That phrase, Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, is one which Lord Stanley, in one of his wayward moods, was
</p>
<p>pleased to apply to the Orangemen of Ireland. At Cavan there were
</p>
<p>30,000 people assembled, and I hope yon will excuse me when I
</p>
<p>venture to state to you and read out what took place at the meeting.
</p>
<p>The Rev. Marcus Beresford came forward and said, " I beg leave
</p>
<p>" to introduce to you the Champion of the Protestants of Ireland, a
</p>
<p>" good and honest man :
</p>
<p>" Here is Mr. Samuel Gray,
</p>
<p>The Protestant hero of Ballibay."
</p>
<p>Mr. Gray appears to have been transported with the reception which
</p>
<p>he met with. Mr. Samuel Gray then came forward and said : " he was
</p>
<p>an honest and straightforward Protestant, and that was his only merit."
</p>
<p>So much for that monster meeting. I now come to the next, which
</p>
<p>consisted of 75,000 persons, not men, women, and children, no, Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, a different class of men, deserving of unaffected respect; a class of
</p>
<p>men who may be misdirected by feelings of partizanship, but whom
</p>
<p>1 for one will never concur in putting down. I quoted to you before
</p>
<p>from the Evening Packet. It is only right, lest I should excite a dange-
</p>
<p>rous jealousy, to quote now from the Evening Mail. Here is a descrip-
</p>
<p>tion of the battalions : " At an early hour in the morning (some of
</p>
<p>" them, indeed, over night) the great landed proprietors of the county
</p>
<p>" repaired to the different points on their respective estates at which

</p>
<p>" it had been previously agreed they should meet their tenants, and
</p>
<p>'< march at their head to the general place of assemblage, so that the
</p>
<p>" area in front of the hustings did not present a very crowded appear-
</p>
<p>" ance until the arrival of the men in large masses, each having a
</p>
<p>" pride of marching, Border fashion, shoulder to shoulder, beside his
</p>
<p>" neighbour and brother, with whom he was ready to sacrifice his
</p>
<p>" life in defence of his country and religion. Shortly after eleven
</p>
<p>" o'clock a tremendous shout from the town announced the approach
</p>
<p>" of the first party. They were from Moira, and were headed by
</p>
<p>" the Rev. II. Waring, who was drawn by the people. A flag, the
</p>
<p>" Union-Jack, was hoisted at Mr. Reilly's as the signal of their arrival.
</p>
<p>" In a few moments they were seen descending from a steep hill to
</p>
<p>" the town, and approaching the place of meeting in a close, dark,
</p>
<p>" and dense mass, comprising certainly not less than 20,000 persons.
</p>
<p>2u
</p>
<p>330
</p>
<p>" Having escorted Mr. Waring to the foot of the platform, they re-
</p>
<p>" ceived his thanks, expressed in warm and energetic language, and,
</p>
<p>" having given three cheers, deployed round and took the position
</p>
<p>" assigned them Amongst those who marched at the
</p>
<p>" head of the largest battalion, if we may use the expression, were
</p>
<p>" the Marquesses of Londonderry and Downshire, LordClanwilliam,
</p>
<p>" Sir Robert Bateson, Colonel Forde, Colonel Blacker, Lord Castle-
</p>
<p>" reagh, and Lord Koden. The latter had 15,000 men, his own fol-
</p>
<p>" lowers. They marched from Dromore. At twelve o'clock the
</p>
<p>" scene was the most imposing that fancy could conceive, or that lan-
</p>
<p>" guage possesses the power of depicting. The spectacle was grand,
</p>
<p>" unique, sublime. There certainly could not have been, upon the
</p>
<p>" most moderate computation, less than 75,000 persons present, exclu-
</p>
<p>" sive of the thousands who filled the town, or thronged to absolute
</p>
<p>" impediment all the adjacent roads and avenues." I make no com-
</p>
<p>ment on those meetings. I think they were perfectly legal and con-
</p>
<p>stitutional, and I hope no precedent may now be established which
</p>
<p>may hereafter be applied in putting such meetings down. But if as-
</p>
<p>semblies so vast are legitimately held by Northern Protestants, to
</p>
<p>the Catholics of the South of Ireland, is not the same privilege to be
</p>
<p>awarded ?
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, permit me to advert to some remarkable matter con-
</p>
<p>tained in the Report of the Committee on Orange Lodges, to which
</p>
<p>I have just referred, relating to a subject on which you have heard
</p>
<p>a good deal from the Attorney-General. They are resolutions
</p>
<p>passed by the Orange Lodges ; and though I deviate in some
</p>
<p>sort from the order which I had prescribed to myself, I do so
</p>
<p>because I find there some matter of peculiar interest : " 15th Feb-
</p>
<p>" ruary, 1833, William Scott, sixteenth company, Royal Sappers and
</p>
<p>" Miners. That the Committee would most willingly forward all
</p>
<p>" documents connected with the Orange System to any confidential
</p>
<p>" person in Ballymona, as prudence would not permit the printed
</p>
<p>" documents should be forwarded direct to our military brethren."

<p>" Joseph Mins of the 1st Royals " " 17th December, 1829, moved
</p>
<p>" by the Rev. Charles Boyton, seconded by Edward Cottingham,
</p>
<p>" that the next warrant number be issued to the 66th regiment ; and
</p>
<p>" that the Quebec brethren be directed to send in a correct return,
</p>
<p>" in order that new warrants may be issued." I have read these reso-
</p>
<p>lutions in order to show you after what fashion men proceed who are
</p>
<p>anxious to obtain influence over the army. One of the charges against
</p>
<p>the traversers is, that they conspired for the purpose of seducing
</p>
<p>Her Majesty's troops from their allegiance. How is it that men pro-
</p>
<p>ceed who have such an enter prize in view ? They pass resolutions to
</p>
<p>" forward documents to confidential persons in Ballymona, as pru-
</p>
<p>" dence will not permit that printed documents should be forwarded
</p>
<p>" direct to our military brethren." They issue warrants for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of establishing Orange Lodges in the regiments. Gentlemen of
</p>
<p>the Jury, what is the evidence in this case against my client, with res-
</p>
<p>pect to the army? Lias any proceeding of an analogous kind been
</p>
<p>331
</p>
<p>adopted? Has any document of a clandestine character been trans-
</p>
<p>mitted to the army? Has money been distributed amongst the ar-
</p>
<p>tny? Have emissaries been employed in the circulation of seditious
</p>
<p>papers ? Have the Catholic Priests who attend the military hospitals,
</p>
<p>been found tampering with the soldiery  and pouring "a leprous distil-
</p>
<p>ment" into their ears? Do you find anyone expedient adopted, to which
</p>
<p>men, anxious to seduce soldiers from their allegiance would, beyond
</p>
<p>a doubt, resort ? All you find in this case is, a speech or two of Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell's with regard to the promotion of the sergeants, and there
</p>
<p>the matter ends. There is a distinct resolution passed, that no sort
</p>
<p>of communication shall be held with the army. In fact, the otdy ma-
</p>
<p>terial document on the subject is the letter of a Mr. Power, a Roman
</p>
<p>Catholic priest, residing in the county of Waterford, who is not a
</p>
<p>member of the Repeal Association, and who is not indicted as a con-
</p>
<p>spirator at all. That letter, which is represented as seditious and
</p>
<p>incendiary, is not prosecuted  Why not? The name of Mr. Power
</p>
<p>is known, his residence is known, the letter he is here to explain to
</p>
<p>you. Is it fair to let that letter pass, to keep it in reserve, and to pro-
</p>
<p>duce it now ?  not against Mr. Power, mind you, he is not indicted
</p>
<p>at all, he is to escape with impunity, but against Daniel O'Connell
</p>
<p>and his son, who had no cognizance of it, who had no communica-
</p>
<p>tion with the author of it  and use it as evidence, on the legal sub-
</p>
<p>tlety that Mr. Power's letter appeared in Mr. Barrett's newspa-
</p>
<p>per, that Mr. Barrett is a member of the Repeal Association, and
</p>
<p>therefore, that Daniel O'Connell is engaged in a conspiracy to se-
</p>
<p>duce the army from their allegiance ? Gentlemen, I state to you
</p>
<p>these facts, not from my own imagination, but as they appear to
</p>
<p>you hi evidence. Let us see what, course has been adopted by the
</p>
<p>Government in this prosecution ? The first step taken was the dis
</p>
<p>missal of the Magistrates. Sir Edward Sugden dismissed them on a
</p>
<p>ground which incurred almost universal condemnation from all par-
</p>
<p>ties. They were dismissed on account of something that was said in
</p>
<p>the House of Commons, and on account of the " inevitable tendency
</p>
<p>of the meetings to outrage." Why, Gentlemen, there has been un-

</p>
<p>equivocal proof given to you that the meetings had no tendency to
</p>
<p>outrage. I use the words " tendency to outrage," because Mr.
</p>
<p>Hatchell asked Mr. Ross, the clandestine Sub-Inspector of the Home
</p>
<p>Office, whether he observed any tendency to outrage, and he said that
</p>
<p>he did not observe the least. Gentlemen, the question for your consi-
</p>
<p>deration is not, after all, whether the Government acted right or wrong
</p>
<p>in the dismissal of these Magistrates, but what was the real character
</p>
<p>of the meetings, and whether (hey deserve the reprobation which has
</p>
<p>been heaped on them ? Let me contrast the proceeding of the Lord
</p>
<p>Chancellor of Ireland with the doctrine laid clown by Baron Alderson
</p>
<p>in his charge to the Grand Jury at the Monmouth Summer Assizes,
</p>
<p>1839. It is reported in 9Car.& P. : "There is no doubt that the people
</p>
<p>" of this country have a perfect right to meet for the purpose of stating
</p>
<p>" what are, or even what they might consider to be, their grievances ;
</p>
<p>" but in order to transmit that right unimpaired to posterity, it is ne-
</p>
<p>u cessary that it should be regulated by law and restrained by reason
</p>
<p>332
</p>
<p>" Therefore, let them meet if they will in open day, peaceably and
</p>
<p>" quietly ; and they would do wisely, when they meet, to do so under
</p>
<p>" the sanction of the constituted authorities of the country. To meet
</p>
<p>" under irresponsible presidency is a dangerous thing. Neverthless, if
</p>
<p>" when they do meet under that irresponsible presidency, they conduct
</p>
<p>" themselves with peace, tranquillity, and order, they will, perhaps, lose
</p>
<p>" their time, but nothing else. They will not put other people into
</p>
<p>" alarm, terror, and consternation. They will probably in the end come
</p>
<p>" to the conclusion, that they have acted foolishly ; but the consti-
</p>
<p>" tution of this country did not, God be thanked, punish persons
</p>
<p>11 who meant to do that which was right, in a peaceable and orderly
</p>
<p>" manner, and who are only in error in the views which they have
</p>
<p>" taken on some subject of political interest." What has been the
</p>
<p>evidence given here? Has a single respectable gentleman  a single
</p>
<p>man of station and rank, living in the place where the meetings
</p>
<p>were held, been produced to prove to you that they were a source
</p>
<p>of apprehension in the neighbourhood ? Has any man been pro-
</p>
<p>duced to prove that they had even a tendency to outrage ? It is al-
</p>
<p>most unnecessary for me to direct your attention to this, because it
</p>
<p>must have struck yourselves that no gentleman of property or station
</p>
<p>in the neighbourhood where these great meetings were held, was
</p>
<p>brought on the table to state that any apprehension was produced by
</p>
<p>them. The officers of the constabulary, and the persons connected
</p>
<p>with the police establishment who have been examined, all concur in
</p>
<p>stating that there was no violation of the peace. Indeed, the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General has stated as much. He charges the traversers, not
</p>
<p>with breaking the peace, but with keeping it, with the malevolent in-
</p>
<p>tention of enabling the whole population to rise at a given time, and
</p>
<p>to establish a sanguinary republic, of which Mr. O'Connell is to be
</p>
<p>the head. Forty-one of those meetings were held, all of the same
</p>
<p>character; and at last a proclamation is determined on, for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of stopping the Clontarf meeting. You have heard the re-
</p>
<p>marks of Mr. O'Connell with reference to the course adopted to-
</p>
<p>wards that meeting, and to me they appear extremely reasonable.

</p>
<p>Notice had been given three weeks before of the intention to hold the
</p>
<p>meeting, and yet the proclamation was not published until late in
</p>
<p>the evening of Saturday, the 7th of October, the day before that
</p>
<p>on which the meeting was to have taken place. Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>said, that he believed the authorities did not intend, by gi\ ing
</p>
<p>this late notice, to induce the people to meet. He did not
</p>
<p>impute to them such an atrocious attempt on the lives of the peo-
</p>
<p>ple as might have been perpetrated by sending the army amongst
</p>
<p>an unarmed populace, if the meeting had taken place. But such an
</p>
<p>event might have occurred, and the Government are at all events
</p>
<p>open to the charge, that they did not use due diligence in giving a
</p>
<p>more timely warning, one which would have removed all doubt and
</p>
<p>uncertainty. But there are some other circumstances connected
</p>
<p>with this proclamation, to which I will call your attention. It has
</p>
<p>always been the usage when a Privy Council is about to assemble, to
</p>
<p>direct summonses to every Privy Councillor residing in Dublin. On
</p>
<p>333
</p>
<p>this occasion those summonses were not issued. I am given to under-
</p>
<p>stand that Chief Baron Brady was not summoned; The Bight Ho-
</p>
<p>nourable Anthony Richard Blake, a Roman Catholic, who was ap-
</p>
<p>pointed Chief Remembrancer of the Court of Exchequer, by a Tory
</p>
<p>administration, an intimate friend of that illustrious statesman, the Mar-
</p>
<p>quis of Wellesley, a man who had never appeared in public assemblies,
</p>
<p>a man who had never made an inflammatory harangue in his life, that
</p>
<p>gentleman did not receive a summons. I have told you who did
</p>
<p>not receive summonses, I will now tell you who did. The Recor-
</p>
<p>der of the city of Dublin, by whom the Jury List was to be revised, in
</p>
<p>whose department that most untoward event, the mutilation of the
</p>
<p>jury panel, occurred, received a summons. It was suggested in this
</p>
<p>Court that the Juror's List might have been mutilated by accident, per-
</p>
<p>haps by a rat, strange hypothesis! I am far from meaning to sug-
</p>
<p>gest that there was any infamous decimation of the Jurors' List. But
</p>
<p>the fact is incontrovertible, that a large portion of the list was
</p>
<p>omitted. I state the fact ; I make no comment on it. The bill
</p>
<p>is sent up and found, and an application is made for the names of
</p>
<p>the witnesses, on the back of the indictment. One of the Judges
</p>
<p>who preside at this trial, gives his opinion that the names of the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses ought to be granted as a matter of right. Another of the
</p>
<p>Judges says, that he does not consider it a matter of right, but that
</p>
<p>he is surprised that the Crown did not give the names of the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses. But from that day to this, notwithstanding the opinion of
</p>
<p>one Judge, that it was a matter of right ; and the opinion of ano-
</p>
<p>ther Judge, that it was most adviseable to do so ; notwithstanding
</p>
<p>that, up to the hour of the trial, the name of a single witness was not
</p>
<p>furnished by the Crown. Then comes the challenge to the array.
</p>
<p>1 he ground of the challenge was, that a large portion of the Jury
</p>
<p>List was omitted. The Jurors' Act may be a preposterous one, be-
</p>
<p>cause, in truth, fortune is the arbiter. You might almost as well
</p>
<p>take the dice and throw for a Jury ; but, the dice are not to be
</p>
<p>loaded. The traverser is not to be deprived of his fair chance, or, if
</p>
<p>I may use the expression, of his fair number of tickets in the lottery

</p>
<p>on which his fate depends. But I am told you have 717 Jurors on
</p>
<p>the list, and that is a sufficient number to take a perfectly fair Jury
</p>
<p>from. Possibly so; but that is not what the law gives me. The law
</p>
<p>gives me a certain number, and the Jury are taken by lot ; it is all
</p>
<p>matter of accident, and in this game of chance, for it is nothing
</p>
<p>else, it is only right that I should be awarded the number of
</p>
<p>contingencies, to which, by law, I am entitled. Gentlemen, one
</p>
<p>of the Judges was of opinion that the challenge to the array 
</p>
<p>to the constitution of the Jury, in the first instance, was well-
</p>
<p>founded. The rest of the Court were not of that opinion, but
</p>
<p>the very fact of there being a difference of opinion should have
</p>
<p>induced the Crown to discharge the order for a Special Jury, and to
</p>
<p>direct the Sheriffs to return a new panel. I do not mean to say that
</p>
<p>the Jury is not fairly constructed ; I mention those incidents, Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, in order that, feeling that the traversers have been deprived
</p>
<p>of some of those contingent benefits given them by the law, you
</p>
<p>334
</p>
<p>may give them an equivalent for any loss which they have sustained
</p>
<p>in your anxious performance of your sacred duty, and protect the
</p>
<p>rights and interests of your fellow-suhjects, whose liberty is at stake.
</p>
<p>At length the trial comes on. The Attorney-General takes ele-
</p>
<p>ven hours to state the case. I was surprised at his brevity, when
</p>
<p>you compare it with this Behemoth of indictments which upheaves
</p>
<p>its vastness on that table. In Hardy's case, which lasted ten or
</p>
<p>eleven days, the indictment does not exceed three or four pages,
</p>
<p>but it requires a demonstration of physical force to lift this indict-
</p>
<p>ment up. Not only, however, this indictment, but a bill of parti-
</p>
<p>culars, a phenomenon in its way, was furnished by the Crown.
</p>
<p>The Attorney- General called on the traversers to answer for
</p>
<p>ninety meetings, and for an infinite variety of publications. The
</p>
<p>Attorney- General in his statement, expressed resentment at the vio-
</p>
<p>lence of language used at some of these meetings, but he put some
</p>
<p>restraint on his indignation, until he came to that part of the charge
</p>
<p>which alleged that Daniel O'Connell, John O'Connell, and the other
</p>
<p>traversers had been guilty of the monstrous crime of taking away the
</p>
<p>business from the Courts. Then he assumed a lofty tone, his moral
</p>
<p>stature rose. How well the great Lord Chatham (I remember to have
</p>
<p>read it somewhere) said : "shake the whole constitution to its centre,
</p>
<p>" the lawyer will sit tranquil in his cabinet; but touch a single thread
</p>
<p>" in the cobwebs of Westminster Hall, and the exasperated spider
</p>
<p>" rushes out to its defence ;" and accordingly a great sensation was
</p>
<p>produced by the learned Attorney-General's statement, a great move-
</p>
<p>ment took place in the Court, it communicated itself to the Hall, and
</p>
<p>reached even to the Common Pleas! With regard to that charge I
</p>
<p>can only express my astonishment that the learned Attorney-General
</p>
<p>did not institute a prosecution against the Society of Friends for con-
</p>

<p>high and indisputable authority in favour of the arbitration system.
</p>
<p>The next charge which the Attorney-General alluded to in chrono-
</p>
<p>logical order was, that Daniel O'Connell had been guilty of a gross
</p>
<p>breach of law by showing a gross ignorance of law in stating that her
</p>
<p>Majesty might call a Parliament in Ireland, and create additional Irish
</p>
<p>boroughs. Why, Gentlemen of the Jury, that is, after all, but a propo-
</p>
<p>sal to swamp the House of Commons ; Sir James Graham once proposed
</p>
<p>to swamp the House of Lords. The present Lord Denman, stated an
</p>
<p>analogous doctrine in the House of Commons, which every body knew
</p>
<p>to be law. But, notwithstanding that doctrine, I own that it would be a
</p>
<p>strong, and not a very constitutional exercise of the Prerogative of (lie
</p>
<p>Crown, to issue writs for the creation of new boroughs. Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell only stated, that the right existed ; and surely a man is not to
</p>
<p>be charged with conspiracy, merely because he makes a statement
</p>
<p>founded on abstract law, but at variance with the principles of our
</p>
<p>335
</p>
<p>modem Constitution. After all, the main charge is this : that a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy was formed, for the purpose of creating a sanguinary revolu-
</p>
<p>tion in this country, and if you believe my client guilty of that crime,
</p>
<p>you will find him guilty, but if not, you are bound to acquit him.
</p>
<p>How is it that men engage in an undertaking of this kind ? Do they
</p>
<p>not bind themselves by oath? Do they not swear to silence, to
</p>
<p>deeds, to death? Do they not associate superstition with atrocity,
</p>
<p>and invoke Heaven to ratify the covenant of Hell ? Do they not
</p>
<p>assemble in dark and solitary places, and verify the exclamation
</p>
<p>put bv the great observer of nature, into the mouth of a conspirator :
</p>
<p>" Oh Conspiracy, where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough to hide
</p>
<p>thy monstrous visage !" Such is the conduct of men who confederate
</p>
<p>for a criminal purpose. What has been the conduct of these men ?
</p>
<p>All has been open as day. It is a conspiracy in the street. Every
</p>
<p>thing has been laid bare. They have, I may say, stripped their minds
</p>
<p>before the Public. For one shilling the representatives of the Home
</p>
<p>Office could learn at the Conciliation Hall all that was said, all that
</p>
<p>was done, and all that was thought. Conspirators are inseparable.
</p>
<p>How do these men act? Mr. Duffy, of the Nation, the publisher
</p>
<p>of the " Memory of the Dead," the great delinquent, did not attend
</p>
<p>a single meeting in the country  he did not even attend the meeting
</p>
<p>at Mullaghmast, where you are told the cap in the shape of the Irish
</p>
<p>Crown was presented to Mr. O'Connell. Why did not the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General produce a fac simile of it from the College Museum ?
</p>
<p>He quoted Moore :
</p>
<p>" Let Erin remember the days of old,
</p>
<p>Ere her faithless sons betrayed her ;
</p>
<p>"When Malachi wore the collar of gold,
</p>
<p>Which he won from her proud invader."
</p>
<p>It is by such mummery as this that this State prosecution is sup-
</p>
<p>ported. But Mr. Duffy did not go to Mullaghmast ; he did not go
</p>
<p>to the Coronation. Will John O'Connell, the Prince Royal, ever
</p>
<p>forgive him ? Mr. Tierney, was not at Mullaghmast. He was guilty
</p>
<p>only of one speech, and should be made Professor of Rhetoric in

</p>
<p>Maynooth,  the only punishment I would inflict upon him. Father
</p>
<p>Tyrrell too was only at one meeting; but they were determined to
</p>
<p>catch a priest. They caught two. One poor fellow is in Malahide
</p>
<p>church-yard. But when they were beating for this sort of game, why
</p>
<p>did they not catch a Bishop ? The Attorney-General mentioned that
</p>
<p>Bishops Higgins and Cantwell, and M'Hale, so he called them, were
</p>
<p>at these meetings; and why not join them in the indictment?
</p>
<p>Were there not episcopal speeches  were there not pastoral letters
</p>
<p>published in the newspapers ? Did we not hear Higgins ! Higgins! !
</p>
<p>Higgins ! ! ! nothing but Higgins for three months ; were not the
</p>
<p>leading articles in the Times, replete with " Higgins ?" was he not
</p>
<p>sometimes " Lord Higgins," then " Bishop Higgins," then plain
</p>
<p>" Higgins," and yet Higgins is not indicted. Nor is John Tuam !
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General thought it prudent not to intermeddle with
</p>
<p>33G
</p>
<p>the redoubted ** John of Tuam," who would have marched to gaol
</p>
<p>with a mitre on his head, and a crosier in his hand, and robed in pon-
</p>
<p>tifical attire, but deemed it more politic to assail a poor priest from
</p>
<p>Monaghan, who attended but one meeting. Gentlemen, look at the
</p>
<p>great mass of political matter which issued from the mind of Mr.O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell within the last nine months. See whether one great sentiment
</p>
<p>does not prevail throughout the entire  a pervading love of order,
</p>
<p>and an unaffected sentiment of abhorrence for the employment of
</p>
<p>any other than loyal, constitutional, and pacific means for the attain-
</p>
<p>ment, of his object. You find him uttering the same sentiments in
</p>
<p>1810 as he did in 1844. You find him declaring that he would not
</p>
<p>purchase the Repeal of the Union at the expense of one drop of
</p>
<p>blood. He announces that the moment the Government send a
</p>
<p>single magistrate to disperse his meetings, they shall be dispersed.
</p>
<p>A man cannot wear the mask of loyalty for forty-four years: how-
</p>
<p>ever skilfully constructed, the vizard will drop off, and the genuine
</p>
<p>features of the truculent conspirator must be disclosed. Daniel
</p>
<p>O'Connell was called to the bar in 1798; he was then in the flush
</p>
<p>of life. His young blood bounded in his veins, and his vigorous body
</p>
<p>was but the type of his athletic and elastic mind. He had come
</p>
<p>from a land of mountains, where he had listened to the roar of the
</p>
<p>wild Atlantic, whose surge rolls unbroken from the coast of Labrador.
</p>
<p>You recollect the striking description which was read to you of the
</p>
<p>spot of his birth, from one of his own speeches. He carried enthu-
</p>
<p>siasm to romance ; and of the impressions which great events are
</p>
<p>calculated to make on minds like his, he was peculiarly susceptible.
</p>
<p>He was unwedded ; he had, to use Lord Bacon's expression, given
</p>
<p>no hostages to the state. The conservative affections had not yet
</p>
<p>fastened their ligaments, tender but indissoluble, to his heart. There
</p>
<p>was an enterprize on foot calculated to attract the adventurous and
</p>
<p>the daring It was guilty ; but not wholly hopeless. The peaks which
</p>
<p>overhang the bay of Bantry are indistinctly seen from the hills of
</p>
<p>Iveragh. At a time so trying what was the part performed by this
</p>
<p>conspirator of sixty-nine ? Did he play Piere at twenty-two who is

</p>
<p>ready to play Renault at sixty-nine ? Not only did he take no part
</p>
<p>in that guilty transaction, but conjecture never lighted on his name.
</p>
<p>Curran was suspected ; Grattan was suspected : both were desig-
</p>
<p>nated as unimpeached traitors; but on the name of Daniel O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell conjecture never lighted. And are you to believe that the man
</p>
<p>who turned with abhorrence from the conspiracy of 1798, now, in an
</p>
<p>old age, which is not premature, would engage in an undertaking
</p>
<p>by which not only his own life, but the lives of those far dearer
</p>
<p>to him than his own  the lives of thousands of his countrymen,
</p>
<p>would inevitably be sacrificed ? Can you believe that he would
</p>
<p>stain the laurels which it is his noblest boast are unspotted by
</p>
<p>blood; that he would drench with gore the land of his birth, of
</p>
<p>his affections, and of his redemption, and for a project as guilty
</p>
<p>as it would be absurd, lay prostrate that great moral monument
</p>
<p>which he has raised so high that it is visible to the remotest
</p>
<p>337
</p>
<p>regions of the world? In the life of Daniel O'Connell I find a re-
</p>
<p>futation of the charges preferred against him. Do you think that
</p>
<p>the man who aimed at a revolution would repudiate the assist-
</p>
<p>ance of France? Do you think that the man who was anxious for a
</p>
<p>revolution would denounce the infamous system of slavery by
</p>
<p>which the great transatlantic Republic, to her everlasting shame,
</p>
<p>permits herself to be degraded? But, to come nearer home, do you
</p>
<p>think that a man with such purposes as have been attributed to him
</p>
<p>by the Attorney General, would spurn at all connexion with the
</p>
<p>Chartists in England? A confederation between the English Char-
</p>
<p>tists and the Irish Repealers would have been formidable. Chartism
</p>
<p>uses its utmost and most clandestine efforts to find its way into Ire-
</p>
<p>land ; O'Connell detects and denounces it. Of the charges that are
</p>
<p>made against him, does not then his whole life contain the refuta-
</p>
<p>tion ? To the accusation that Mr. O'Connell and his son conspired
</p>
<p>to excite animosity amongst Her Majesty's subjects, my last observa-
</p>
<p>tion is more peculiarly applicable. The only remaining topic to
</p>
<p>which I shall advert is, the charge to create hostility amongst Her
</p>
<p>Majesty's subjects. In all the speeches and publications with which
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell is alleged to be connected, can you show me a single
</p>
<p>phrase which contains the slightest reflection on the Protestant re-
</p>
<p>ligion ? God knows we and our creed are too often made the
</p>
<p>subject of vituperation. Men speak of our religion as idolatrous,
</p>
<p>and of our clergy as surpliced ruffians  we feel no resentment. Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell believes firmly in his religion, and does his best to prac-
</p>
<p>tise it. That religion teaches him two things: one to entertain feel-
</p>
<p>ings of charity towards those who dissent from him  the other to
</p>
<p>forgive those who do him wrong. It is from incidents which seem com-
</p>
<p>paratively of small importance, that a man's character may be often
</p>
<p>estimated. You recollect a reference having been made two or three
</p>
<p>times in the course of the evidence, to Sir Abraham Bradley King.
</p>
<p>He was Mr. O'Connell's political, almost his personal enemy. Poor
</p>
<p>man! he was deprived of his office, and the Whig Government had
</p>
<p>determined to deprive him of all compensation. I often saw him

<p>standing in the lobby of the House of Commons, a most forlorn and
</p>
<p>wretched man. The only one of his old friends who stuck to him
</p>
<p>was Baron Lefroy. But Baron Lefroy had no interest with the
</p>
<p>Government. Mr. O'Connell, struck with pity for his misfortunes,
</p>
<p>went to Lord Althorp, pleaded his cause, and obtained the com-
</p>
<p>pensation which had been refused him. I remembered a letter
</p>
<p>written by him to Mr. O'Connell. I went to him and asked for
</p>
<p>it. He could not at first put his hand upon it, but while look-
</p>
<p>ing for it he told me, that soon after the death of Sir Abra-
</p>
<p>ham Bradley King, an officer entered his study, and told him he
</p>
<p>was the Alderman's son-in-law. He said : " a short tmie before
</p>
<p>" his death, Sir Abraham called me to his bed-side, and gave me this
</p>
<p>" injunction, 'when I am buried go to Dublin, wait on Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>" ' nell, and tell him, that in the last moments of my life I recollected
</p>
<p>" ' his kindness ; and that I prayed in my last prayer that all good
</p>
<p>" 'fortune should attend him, and that every peril should be averted
</p>
<p>2x
</p>
<p>338
</p>
<p>" ' from his head.' " This is the letter. It is short, let me be per-
</p>
<p>mitted to read it to you :
</p>
<p>" Barrett's Hotel, Spring Gardens,
</p>
<p>" 4th August, 1834.
</p>
<p>" Very dear Sir,  The anxious wish for a satisfactory termina-
</p>
<p>" tion of my cause, which your continued and unwearied efforts for
</p>
<p>" it have ever indicated, is at length accomplished. The vote of
</p>
<p>" compensation passed last night. To Mr. Lefroy and to yourself
</p>
<p>" am I indebted, for putting the case in the right light; to my Lord
</p>
<p>" Althorp  for his Lordship's considerate, candid, and straigbtfor-
</p>
<p>" ward act, in giving me my just dues, and thus restoring myself and
</p>
<p>" family to competence, ease, and happiness.
</p>
<p>" To you, Sir, to whom I was early and long politically opposed
</p>
<p>li  to you who, nobly forgetting this continued difference of opi-
</p>
<p>" nion, and who, rejecting every idea of party feeling or of party
</p>
<p>" spirit, thought only of my distress, and sped to succour and support
</p>
<p>" me, how can I express my gratitude? I cannot attempt it. The
</p>
<p>" reward I feel is to be found only in your own breast ; and I assure
</p>
<p>" myself that the generous feelings of a noble mind will cheer you
</p>
<p>" on to that prosperity and happiness which a discriminating Provi-
</p>
<p>" dence holds out to those who protect the helpless and sustain the
</p>
<p>" falling.
</p>
<p>" For such reward and happiness to you and your's my prayers
</p>
<p>" shall be offered fervently ; while the remainder of my days, passing,
</p>
<p>" I trust, in tranquillity, by a complete retirement from public life,
</p>
<p>" and in the bosom of my family, will constantly present to me the
</p>
<p>" grateful recollection of one to whom I am mainly indebted for so
</p>
<p>" desirable a closing of my life.
</p>
<p>" Believe me, my dear Sir, with the greatest respect and truth,
</p>
<p>" Your faithful Servant,
</p>
<p>" Abraham Bradley King."
</p>
<p>You may deprive of his liberty the man to whom that letter was
</p>
<p>addressed  you may deprive him of the sight of nature  you
</p>
<p>may bury him in a dungeon to which a ray of the sun has never

<p>yet descended; but you cannot take away from hitn the conscious-
</p>
<p>ness of having done a noble action  you cannot take away from
</p>
<p>him the right of kneeling down every night before he sleeps,
</p>
<p>and asking for forgiveness in the divinest part of his Redeemer's
</p>
<p>prayer. The man to whom that letter was addressed is not
</p>
<p>guilty  the son of that man is not guilty of the intent as-
</p>
<p>cribed to him, and of this he puts himself upon his country.
</p>
<p>Let that phrase be rescued from its technicality ; let it be no
</p>
<p>longer a fictitious one. We have lost the representation of our
</p>
<p>country In the Parliament, let us find it in the jury box:  Let
</p>
<p>your verdict prove that in the feelings of millions of your coun-
</p>
<p>trymen, you participate. But it is not to Ireland that the ach-
</p>
<p>ing solicitude with which the result of this trial is intently watched
</p>
<p>will be confined. There is not a great city in Europe in which,
</p>
<p>339
</p>
<p>upon the day when the great intelligence shall be expected to arrive,
</p>
<p>men will not stop each other in the public way, and inquire whether
</p>
<p>twelve Irishmen upon their oaths have doomed to incarceration the
</p>
<p>man who gave liberty to Ireland ? Whatever may be your adjudica-
</p>
<p>tion, he is prepared to meet it. He knows that the eyes of the world
</p>
<p>are upon him, and that posterity  whether in a gaol or out of it  will
</p>
<p>look back to him with admiration ; he is almost indifferent to what
</p>
<p>may befal him, and is far more solicitous for others at this moment
</p>
<p>than for himself. But I  at the commencement of what I have said
</p>
<p>to you, I told you that I was not unmoved, and that many incidents
</p>
<p>of my political life, the strange vicissitudes of fortune through which
</p>
<p>I have passed, came back upon me. But now:  the bare possibility
</p>
<p>at which I have glanced has, I acknowledge, almost unmanned me.
</p>
<p>Shall I, who stretch out to you in behalf of the son the hand whose
</p>
<p>fetters the father has struck off, live to cast my eyes upon that domicile
</p>
<p>of sorrow, in the vicinity of this great metropolis, and say: "'Tis
</p>
<p>" there they have immured the Liberator of Ireland with his best and
</p>
<p>" best-beloved child." No ! you will not consign my client, and the
</p>
<p>father of my client, to the spot to which the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>invokes you to deliver him. When the winter shall have passed,
</p>
<p>and the spring shall come again, it is not from the window of a
</p>
<p>prison-house that the father of such a son, and the son of such a
</p>
<p>father, shall look out on the green hills on which the eyes of so
</p>
<p>many a captive have gazed so wistfully in vain ; but in their
</p>
<p>own mountain home, they shall listen again to the murmurs of
</p>
<p>the great Atlantic ; on the hills where they were bom they shall
</p>
<p>go forth together to inhale the freshness of the morning air; "they
</p>
<p>shall be free of mountain solitudes;" they shall be encompassed
</p>
<p>with images of liberty on every side ; and if time shall have taken its
</p>
<p>suppleness from the father's knee, or shall have impaired the firm-
</p>
<p>ness of his tread, he shall, resting on the summit of some high place,
</p>
<p>lean upon his child  the child of one who looks down on him from
</p>
<p>heaven  and shall look far and wide into the land whose great-
</p>
<p>ness and whose glory shall be for ever associated with his name.

<p>In your love of justice, in your love of Ireland, in your love of
</p>
<p>honesty and of fair play, I place my confidence. I ask for an ac-
</p>
<p>quittal, not only for the sake of your country, but for your own.
</p>
<p>Upon the day when this trial shall have been brought to a ter-
</p>
<p>mination, when, amidst the hush of public expectancy, in answer to
</p>
<p>the solemn interrogatory which shall be put to you by the officer of
</p>
<p>the Court, you shall answer, " not guilty," with what a transport will
</p>
<p>that glorious negative be welcomed ! How will you be blest, adored,
</p>
<p>worshipped ; and when retiring from this scene of excitement and of
</p>
<p>passion, you shall return to your own tranquil homes, how pleasurably
</p>
<p>will you look upon your children, in the consciousness that you will
</p>
<p>have left them a patrimony of peace, by impressing upon the British
</p>
<p>cabinet, that some other measure besides a state prosecution is ne-
</p>
<p>cessary for the pacification of your country.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moove My Lords, I certainly feel great difficulty in rising
</p>
<p>to address the Jury, after the speech which has just been made by
</p>
<p>340
</p>
<p>my learned friend ; and I should be grateful to your Lordships not
</p>
<p>lo call on me to address the Jury until Monday morning.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  It is the desire of the Court to
</p>
<p>give you every indulgence ; and unless the Attorney-General re-
</p>
<p>quires you to go on to-day, we shall adjourn until Monday.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General I should certainly think it very im-
</p>
<p>proper to interfere in any way with Mr. Moore.
</p>
<p>MONDAY, January 29th,
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore then addressed the Court.
</p>
<p>My Lords, and Gentlemen of the Jury,
</p>
<p>In this case I am counsel on behalf of one of the traversers, the
</p>
<p>Rev. Thomas Tierney ; and it now becomes my duty, as the next
</p>
<p>counsel in seniority to my friend, Mr. Sheil, and in that right, and
</p>
<p>in that character alone, to lay before you the facts and circum-
</p>
<p>stances of my client's case ; and I do, with very respectful confi-
</p>
<p>dence, anticipate your verdict of acquittal in favour of my client.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, 1 very unfeignedly feel the great disadvantage I la-
</p>
<p>bour under in having to address you after the able, brilliant, and
</p>
<p>eloquent display of my friend, Mr. Sheil. If that disadvantage
</p>
<p>was to be merely personal ; if it could not in the slightest degree
</p>
<p>affect my client, it would not be worthy of one moment's conside-
</p>
<p>ration ; and, although I acknowledge my perfect inability either to
</p>
<p>amuse you by wit or delight you by eloquence, and although I pos-
</p>
<p>sess not the power of addressing to you any of those affecting ap-
</p>
<p>peals which he made, yet I confidently hope you will extend to me,
</p>
<p>while I am laying my client's case before you, the same patience and
</p>
<p>the same attention which I have observed you invariably bestow upon
</p>
<p>every branch and upon every feature of this important case. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, there is one observation, which was made by the Attorney-Gene-
</p>
<p>ral in his opening statement, in which I fully concur, and from which
</p>
<p>no man can dissent. He told you this was a momentous case, and be
</p>
<p>might have added that it comes before you under momentous circum-
</p>
<p>stances and in momentous times. When we consider the great and
</p>
<p>important question  I mean the Repeal of the Union  out of which

</p>
<p>this prosecution has undeniably arisen ; when we consider the deep
</p>
<p>and all-pervading interest which has been excited through every part
</p>
<p>of Ireland, from one end to the other ; when we consider the hundreds
</p>
<p>of thousands  I may say millions, of our countrymen that have une-
</p>
<p>quivocally, but peaceably, expressed their opinion in favour of that
</p>
<p>measure ; and when we consider that one of the traversers at the bar
</p>
<p>is a gentleman possessing the unlimited confidence of those millions,
</p>
<p>and exercising a greater degree of moral influence over their minds
</p>
<p>than any individual ever before possessed over the minds of a free peo-
</p>
<p>ple, in a free country ; when we find that man brought to the bar of

<p>this Court, and branded, or sought to be branded, with the crime of
</p>
<p>conspiracy ; when we consider that in every part of this country there
</p>
<p>is the most feverish and restless anxiety with regard to the result of
</p>
<p>your verdict, the Attorney-General may well say that this is a momen-
</p>
<p>tous case. Gentlemen, I cannot concur with the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>in thinking that the prosecution, which he has instituted, is one that
</p>
<p>either in its circumstances, its nature, or its conduct, is calculated for
</p>
<p>this momentous case. The Attorney-General has not condescended
</p>
<p>to tell you what were his motives for instituting this prosecution ; he
</p>
<p>has not explained to you the benefits which he expected to result from
</p>
<p>it. He would, perhaps, have told you his object was to bring to jus-
</p>
<p>tice a person who had violated the law. If that be his motive, I will
</p>
<p>be able to show him, and I hope you too, that there never was a course
</p>
<p>less adapted to that purpose than the present prosecution. If he ex-
</p>
<p>pected that the effect of this prosecution would be to allay the feelin-
</p>
<p>of irritation and animosity at present existing in this country, never
</p>
<p>was a more unfortunate expedient resorted to than this prosecution.
</p>
<p>No man can shut his eyes to this fact, that from first to last of this
</p>
<p>prosecution, from its original institution down to the moment I am
</p>
<p>addressing you, the conduct of the prosecutor was such as to create a
</p>
<p>greater degree of bitterness and animosity than ever existed in this
</p>
<p>country before. Gentlemen, is it the expectation of the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General that the effect of this prosecution will be to put down the dis-
</p>
<p>cussion of the question of the Repeal of the Union ? Is that the hope
</p>
<p>of the Government which he serves ? If that be what he expects to
</p>
<p>result from it, I must confess a more idle or empty chimera never
</p>
<p>crossed the mind of an Attorney-General. He has entered into an
</p>
<p>argument on the question of the Repeal of the Union. I do not mean
</p>
<p>to follow his example. He has held out to you what he considered
</p>
<p>strong grounds to make you believe that it was impracticable and unat-
</p>
<p>tainable. If the Repeal of the Union  that important question which
</p>
<p>now pervades every portion of this land  be so destitute of merits as
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General wishes to represent to you ; if it be impractica-
</p>
<p>ble and unattainable, it does not want the aid of a prosecution to put

</p>
<p>it down. If it be so destitute of merits as he would represent it to
</p>
<p>you, it must fall by its own weakness. But if, on the other hand, that
</p>
<p>question has those merits which hundreds of thousands of your coun-
</p>
<p>trymen think it possesses, how idle is the hope or the expectation to
</p>
<p>crush it by a prosecution. On this great question I do not mean to
</p>
<p>intimate or express any opinion of my own; but this I will say, let
</p>
<p>the merits or demerits be what they may, I trust that the time will
</p>
<p>never arrive when it will be in the power of any Attorney-General, or
</p>
<p>in the power of any Government, to crush or stifle the discussion of
</p>
<p>it, or the free discussion of any great public question.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, it appears to me to be of the utmost
</p>
<p>importance in this case, that you should very distinctly carry in
</p>
<p>your minds the nature of the charge that is preferred against the
</p>
<p>traversers at the bar ; that charge is confined to a single one
</p>
<p>the charge of conspiracy. I beg of you to carry in your recol-
</p>
<p>342
</p>
<p>lection that there is no indictment against any one of the tra-
</p>
<p>versers for having 1 attended an unlawful meeting ; there is no in-
</p>
<p>dictment against any one of the traversers for uttering seditious
</p>
<p>speeches ; there is no indictment against anyone of the traversers for
</p>
<p>having sent forward to the world a seditious publication; but the sin-
</p>
<p>gle charge preferred against the traversers at the bar is, that they are
</p>
<p>guilty of conspiracy. How is that charge sought to be made out?
</p>
<p>By the allegatiou that there were meetings that were unlawful, and
</p>
<p>that those meetings were attended by some of the traversers ; by the
</p>
<p>allegation that seditious speeches were spoken at those meetings by
</p>
<p>some of the traversers. But does it not occur to you, that, if the
</p>
<p>object of the Attorney-General was to bring to justice those who, in
</p>
<p>his opinion, had violated the law, that there was the most easy, simple,
</p>
<p>and obvious course for him to take. If the meetings, of which you
</p>
<p>have heard so much in detail, were unlawful; if they are unlawful
</p>
<p>now, they must have been unlawful at the time they were held. If
</p>
<p>those speeches are seditious now, they must have been seditious at the
</p>
<p>time they were uttered ; and yet how does it happen that, although
</p>
<p>those meetings have been held almost weekly for a period of nine
</p>
<p>months ; although the speeches now complained of have been made al-
</p>
<p>most from day to day during that period, how does it happen that the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General never yet ventured to prefer an indictment against
</p>
<p>anyone of the individuals that attended those assemblies that he seeks
</p>
<p>now to designate as unlawful? or to institute a prosecution against any
</p>
<p>one of those individuals that uttered those speeches, that he now tells
</p>
<p>you are seditious ? If those meetings were illegal, or the speeches
</p>
<p>seditious, what was more easy than for him to indict any one that at-
</p>
<p>tended those meetings, or uttered those speeches ? Let me take, for
</p>
<p>instance, Mr. O'Connell, who attended at almost all the meetings.
</p>
<p>Suppose he was indicted for having attended an illegal meeting, could
</p>
<p>anything be more simple than the proceeding on the part of the At-
</p>
<p>torney-General ? That the meetings took place, and that Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell attended them, is undeniable. The material facts of the case
</p>
<p>were established to the hand of the Attorney-General ; and, if the

</p>
<p>meetings were unlawful, he had nothing to do but satisfy the Court
</p>
<p>and Jury that they were so, and thus bring the matter to issue at a
</p>
<p>single point. But have I not reason to complain, on the part of my
</p>
<p>client, of the course which has been adopted. If my client has at-
</p>
<p>tended an illegal meeting, or uttered a seditious speech, why not
</p>
<p>indict him for it ? The charge against him would be simple, and his
</p>
<p>defence, if he had any, would be easy. The Attorney-General has
</p>
<p>abandoned the easy, artless, unencumbered course which it was open
</p>
<p>to him to take, and he adopts a course which appears to me to be in
</p>
<p>violation of every principle of justice  he seeks to make one man re-
</p>
<p>sponsible for the acts and language of others. He flings all the tra-
</p>
<p>versers into one indictment; he entangles them, one and all, within
</p>
<p>the meshes of a piosecution for conspiracy ; and, although it is not
</p>
<p>even alleged that my client ever was in connexion with any of the tra-
</p>
<p>versers until the 3rd of October, after all the monster meetings had
</p>
<p>343
</p>
<p>ceased, he endeavours, notwithstanding, to make him responsible for
</p>
<p>all the antecedent acts of others ; and my client is thus sought to be
</p>
<p>visited with the consequences of speeches he never heard, meetings
</p>
<p>he never attended, and publications which he never read. Is this
</p>
<p>fair ? Is this candid ? Is this ingenuous ? The principles of jus-
</p>
<p>tice declare that each man is only to be made responsible for his own
</p>
<p>conduct ; yet the Attorney-General seeks, through the medium of the
</p>
<p>doctrine of conspiracy, to make my client answerable for the words
</p>
<p>and actions of other men, in which he never participated, and of
</p>
<p>whMch he had no knowledge. My Lords, and Gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>Jury, in my humble judgment a public prosecutor has no right to aban-
</p>
<p>don the direct and obvious path which lies before him, and to
</p>
<p>adopt the tortuous and complicated course of a prosecution for con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, with a view to implicate one man in the acts and designs
</p>
<p>of others ; and in adopting such a course of proceeding, I have no
</p>
<p>hesitation in characterizing his conduct as equally unfair, oppressive,
</p>
<p>and unjust.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the Attorney-General, in his speech, took up all
</p>
<p>the meetings seriatim ; he began with the earliest and went down
</p>
<p>to the latest, and he told you emphatically that they were all il-
</p>
<p>legal. He read for you a number of speeches, which he told you
</p>
<p>were seditious ; he also called your attention to certain extracts from
</p>
<p>articles which appeared in different newspapers, which he also cha-
</p>
<p>racterized as being in violation of the law. Gentlemen, it certainly
</p>
<p>did appear to me that the Attorney-General, when he made those
</p>
<p>statements, was pronouncing a bitter Philippic upon himself and the
</p>
<p>Government which he served. Am I not entitled to ask a question,
</p>
<p>which presses itself irresistibly on the mind of every man  how has
</p>
<p>it happened that, if those meetings, which occurred so frequently
</p>
<p>during a period of nine months, were illegal ; if the language used at
</p>
<p>them was seditious, no prosecution was ever instituted until now ?
</p>
<p>How does the Attorney-General reconcile it to his own conscience,
</p>
<p>or to the duty which he owes to the country, and the Government
</p>
<p>whose servant he is, that for such a length of time he has never until

</p>
<p>now taken a step to repress those meetings, and why has he neglected
</p>
<p>the important duty of bringing to justice those who, as he now
</p>
<p>alleges, had so repeatedly violated the law ? Did he lie designedly
</p>
<p>by, in order that crime might accumulate, and that he might be able
</p>
<p>to encompass whole masses of criminals within the meshes of the
</p>
<p>law? To enable him to select his victims at his pleasure? Was
</p>
<p>this the object of the Attorney-General ? Was this the object of the
</p>
<p>Government he serves ? Gentlemen, it is the duty of the Go-
</p>
<p>vernment to bring to punishment those who violate the law ; but
</p>
<p>a Government has a greater and more important duty to perform ;
</p>
<p>a duty with the due performance of which the best interests of the
</p>
<p>common weal are yet more inseparably identified, and that duty con-
</p>
<p>sists in preventing the commission of crime; and if it were the deli-
</p>
<p>berate opinion of the Attorney-General, and if the Government were
</p>
<p>under the conviction that those meetings were all illegal, and the
</p>
<p>344
</p>
<p>speeches seditious; if, I say, they knew all this, and yet designedly
</p>
<p>lay by while they saw crime committed, while they saw the infatuated
</p>
<p>people rushing- in masses into a violation of the law, I would unhesi-
</p>
<p>tatingly brand such an act as an act of the greatest and most unpa-
</p>
<p>ralleled baseness of which a Government could be guilty. What ! a
</p>
<p>Government to look calmly on, while they saw the people rushing by
</p>
<p>thousands into the commission of crime, and yet not a finger raised,
</p>
<p>nor a word uttered to warn them of their folly ? Was it their plan
</p>
<p>to wait until they had a whole nation within their meshes, in order
</p>
<p>that they might select such victims as they would wish to immolate
</p>
<p>upon the altar of the law? But, my Lords and Gentlemen, let me
</p>
<p>not be misunderstood ; I make no such charge against the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General, I impute no such design to him or to the Government; I
</p>
<p>do not seek to bring a charge of such a nefarious intention against
</p>
<p>them, for nefarious I believe it would be. I never will believe that
</p>
<p>any Government in these countries, whether composed of men who
</p>
<p>are, politically speaking, my friends or my antagonists, could be guilty
</p>
<p>of such unparalleled baseness. No ! I impute no such crime to them,
</p>
<p>I know that there are members of that government that would be utterly
</p>
<p>incapable of such conduct. I have the honour of a slight acquaintance
</p>
<p>with two of them. I know their sense of honour and of justice ; and
</p>
<p>Iknowthey would fling to the winds the high stations which they
</p>
<p>occupy, rather than be participators in such a design. I therefore do
</p>
<p>not impute to the Government such an object; nor do I charge them
</p>
<p>even with negligence ; I attribute their conduct to another source.
</p>
<p>It strikes me, as a fair principle of charity, that where you can
</p>
<p>find a good and proper motive to refer the conduct of another
</p>
<p>to, it is to that pure motive, not to any sinister designs, his ac-
</p>
<p>tions ought to be attributed. I willingly grant the benefit of this
</p>
<p>maxim to the Government, and I shall hereafter respectfully ask for
</p>
<p>the application of the same principle to the case of my client. Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, the conviction in my mind is this, that though the Attorney
</p>
<p>General has " screwed his courage to the sticking place," and though
</p>
<p>he is now prepared to come into Court, and brand all those meetings

</p>
<p>with a charge of illegality, yet he never felt himself so strong in that
</p>
<p>position as to venture to bring any single case under the consideration
</p>
<p>of any Court or jury. Let the result of the present prosecution be
</p>
<p>what it may, it is still open to him to adopt that course. Let him
</p>
<p>select all or any of the meetings he pleases; let him bring into this
</p>
<p>Court any or all of the persons who attended those meetings, and let
</p>
<p>him try the question fairly ; but that has not been done. The cause
</p>
<p>is obvious. The Attorney General is an able lawyer, and if he could
</p>
<p>have told the Government that those meetings were illegal, if his
</p>
<p>mind were made up on that point, I have no doubt he would at once
</p>
<p>have said to the Government, that he could not look on and see the
</p>
<p>law violated ; and he would have told them that he felt it his duty to
</p>
<p>institute the necessary prosecutions against the persons who had done
</p>
<p>those criminal acts; but it is my firm conviction that the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General was not prepared to go such lengths as to sanction any prose-
</p>
<p>345
</p>
<p>cution by I) is authority, and the meetings were therefore allowed to go
</p>
<p>on for a period of nine months, because no lawyer was bold enough to
</p>
<p>say that they ought to be put down. What is the use I make of this ?
</p>
<p>If the Attorney- General was doubtful in his own mind that any breach
</p>
<p>of the law had been committed  if he could not, during- nine months,
</p>
<p>be able to bring himself to the conclusion that the meetings were
</p>
<p>illegal  is he now to be allowed, when thousands have attended those
</p>
<p>meetings, with a full conviction on their minds, that they were not
</p>
<p>violating the law, to brand them with illegality and sedition ? When-
</p>
<p>ever you find an Attorney-General abandoning the direct and obvious
</p>
<p>course which was before him, and adopting a tortuous and complicated
</p>
<p>one, tacitly permitting the assemblage of the people, no jury should aid
</p>
<p>or assist him to bring to punishment those who attended. And I take
</p>
<p>the liberty of saying, that if the Attorney-General be right in his
</p>
<p>law, thousands upon thousands have been lured into the commission
</p>
<p>of crime.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General having gone seriatim through all those
</p>
<p>meetings, he came to a meeting which was to have been held at
</p>
<p>Clontarf on the 8th of October, and I must confess, I never ex-
</p>
<p>perienced a greater degree of surprise and astonishment, than when
</p>
<p>I heard him tell you, that that meeting was abandoned from a con-
</p>
<p>viction of its illegality. I am sure the Attorney- General entertained
</p>
<p>that opinion, or he would not have expressed it, but I am sure there
</p>
<p>is no other individual in the community, who would for a moment
</p>
<p>think that the cause of its abandonment was a conviction of its ille-
</p>
<p>gality. Does the Attorney-General forget, or does he expect the
</p>
<p>people of this country will forget, the extraordinary circumstances
</p>
<p>which occurred with regard to that meeting? Does he forget the
</p>
<p>almost breathless haste with which the Lord Lieutenant came to this
</p>
<p>country, on the day or day but one before that meeting? Does he
</p>
<p>forget the far-famed proclamation that issued the evening preceding
</p>
<p>the day on which the meeting was to have been held ? Does he for-
</p>
<p>get that the garrison of Dublin was poured forth to the place where
</p>
<p>the meeting was to have been held ? or does he forget that every

</p>
<p>preparation was made, by force of the bayonet and sword, to put
</p>
<p>down that meeting? and does he, after this, say it was abandoned
</p>
<p>from a conviction of its illegality ? No, Gentlemen, that was not the
</p>
<p>cause of its abandonment. I do not blame the Government for its
</p>
<p>interference with those proceedings. I do not even find fault with
</p>
<p>them for their most unaccountable delay. I will impute no blame
</p>
<p>when I am unacquainted with the facts, but this I will say, the aban-
</p>
<p>donment was owing, not to a conviction of its illegality, but to
</p>
<p>the exertions of one of the traversers; to his strong sense of jus-
</p>
<p>tice and feeling of humanity  the feelings of a just and honest
</p>
<p>citizen. He saw the consequences that might have resulted, had
</p>
<p>that meeting taken place. Picture to yourselves what might have
</p>
<p>occurred. You had on one hand the tried battalions of Britain,
</p>
<p>armed with every implement of war, guided by the most expe-
</p>
<p>rienced leaders, ready to do what those leaders might think right ;
</p>
<p>2Y
</p>
<p>340
</p>
<p>on the other hand, you had an unarmed and defenceless multitude.
</p>
<p>The occurrence of the slightest accident, of the slightest approach to
</p>
<p>violence, of even an angry expression, and a collision between the
</p>
<p>army and the people might have ensued. The armed soldiery of this
</p>
<p>country might have been let loose in the full plenitude of their strength
</p>
<p>upon an unarmed, helpless, and, I may add, defenceless multitude, and
</p>
<p>the plains of Clontarf might have been a second time saturated with
</p>
<p>the blood of its countrymen. That such a danger was averted is due
</p>
<p>to Mr. O'Connell. He stopped that meeting, not, as I said before,
</p>
<p>from a conviction of its illegality, but because he foresaw the fearful
</p>
<p>consequences that might have flowed from it, and, in my judgment,
</p>
<p>he is entitled to the warm gratitude of every friend of humanity for
</p>
<p>his conduct on that occasion, and there is not an individual in the
</p>
<p>community who owes him a deeper debt of gratitude than the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General himself. I hesitate not to say, that if I were to select
</p>
<p>the act of Mr. O'Connell's life which was most deserving of praise,
</p>
<p>the act of his which I would most wish to send down with his name
</p>
<p>to posterity, I would not select his exertions for Catholic Emancipa-
</p>
<p>tion  that great measure by which he restored millions of his country-
</p>
<p>men to their rights  but I would select his conduct on the occasion
</p>
<p>of this Clontarf meeting, by which he averted those consequences
</p>
<p>which might have outraged every feeling of humanity.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, let me now call your attention to the nature of the charges
</p>
<p>brought against the traversers. They are charged with combining, con-
</p>
<p>spiring, and confederating together, for the bad and atrocious purposes
</p>
<p>imputed to them by this indictment, which appears to me untruly
</p>
<p>and unjustly attributed to them. Gentlemen, if you separate from
</p>
<p>tbe charge of conspiracy the high-sounding phrases given by this in-
</p>
<p>dictment, you will find that it is nothing more or less in point of
</p>
<p>law than this, an agreement between two or more persons, to do an
</p>
<p>illegal act or to do a legal act by illegal means. The very instant
</p>
<p>that such an agreement is entered into the crime is complete ; and if
</p>
<p>men agree to do an illegal act, they may be put on their trial for a
</p>
<p>conspiracy the very hour and moment after they entered into that

</p>
<p>agreement, and it is not necessary that there should be any act
</p>
<p>done or outrage committed ; the offence consists in the agreement
</p>
<p>being entered into, and before you can convict my client or any one
</p>
<p>of the traversers, you must be satisfied that they did enter into that
</p>
<p>agreement for the purpose stated in the indictment. Gentlemen, on
</p>
<p>the part of my client, the Rev. Thomas Tierney, I controvert that
</p>
<p>allegation altogether ; I deny that any such agreement was entered
</p>
<p>into by the traversers. I deny that if such did exist that you have a
</p>
<p>particle of evidence, upon which it is possible you could say, in jus-
</p>
<p>tice to yonrselves, that my client was implicated in it. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>let me ask you this plain and simple question : have you a shadow of
</p>
<p>evidence of the existence of such an agreement by the traversers in
</p>
<p>general or by Mr. Tierney in particular? Have you had any person pro-
</p>
<p>duced to you who ever saw them together arranging such an agree-
</p>
<p>ment, or who ever said he knew that such an agreement had been
</p>
<p>entered into ? I do not mean to say, that you should have direct
</p>
<p>347
</p>
<p>evidence of the fact, I acknowledge it might be made out without
</p>
<p>direct positive testimony, but what testimony of any kind have you
</p>
<p>to enable you to say that this agreement did take place ? When
</p>
<p>could you say it took place ? Has the Attorney-General shown you
</p>
<p>when it did take place ? He has gone over a period of nine months,
</p>
<p>and he has then left it to you to arrive at the date from which you can
</p>
<p>infer the existence of this alleged agreement. He has not told you
</p>
<p>when the agreement took place. The meetings have been held in
</p>
<p>every part of Ireland. Did it take place in the North or the South,
</p>
<p>in the East or the West ? Was it before the first meeting, or before
</p>
<p>the second or the third ? He has offered no evidence to show at
</p>
<p>what time or place such an agreement was entered into. He has
</p>
<p>read to you innumerable speeches and publications; he has read ex-
</p>
<p>tracts from the newspapers; he has given you a line of prose here,
</p>
<p>and a line of verse there, and he flings them into your jury-box, and
</p>
<p>calls upon you to spell and construct a conspiracy out of them. I
</p>
<p>trust you will never do it, when you recollect that the Attorney-Ge-
</p>
<p>neral had a plain course before him to vindicate the law, which, if
</p>
<p>he had adopted, he might have tried every one of the traversers in
</p>
<p>less time than it took him to address you in this case, and, therefore,
</p>
<p>I am sure you will not aid him, you will not infer for him the exis-
</p>
<p>tence of a conspiracy, for, Gentlemen, it is the principle of all cri-
</p>
<p>minal law, that the charge should be made out by proof, it is not left
</p>
<p>to a jury to conjecture criminality. Gentlemen, my friend, Mr. Sheil,
</p>
<p>called your attention to the indictment in this case, and he described
</p>
<p>it, as he well might have done, as a monster indictment, words which
</p>
<p>are peculiarly appropriate, for it is in accordance with the oft repeated
</p>
<p>expressions of the Attorney-General himself, in the course of the
</p>
<p>present prosecution. Gentlemen, it well deserves to be called a
</p>
<p>monster indictment; I do not believe a precedent for it is to be found
</p>
<p>in the records of our criminal courts. It is truly a monster, and it
</p>
<p>well deserves to be handed down to posterity as the Frankenstein of
</p>
<p>the imagination of her Majesty's Attorney-General for Ireland. Is
</p>
<p>it not a monstrous indictment? You have in it an accumulation of

</p>
<p>meetings, of speeches, of publications, and from them all the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General asks you to extract the materials which would substan-
</p>
<p>tiate a charge of conspiracy. You have not heard it read, and I will not
</p>
<p>say it would afford you much pleasure to hear it read, but you may
</p>
<p>think it necessary in the discharge of your duty to read it, and if you
</p>
<p>read it twenty times over, I doubt whether you could recollect half
</p>
<p>of the multitude of statements which are contained in it. Every
</p>
<p>person knows that the Grand Jury were occupied several days in the
</p>
<p>discussion of it ; to be sure, they ultimately found the bill, but it
</p>
<p>was notorious, as one of them stated it in the open Court, that they
</p>
<p>were not unanimous in the finding of that bill. The duty of the
</p>
<p>Grand Jury is only a preliminary step in the proceeding, and though
</p>
<p>they were allowed to look only at one side of the case, yet it took
</p>
<p>them several days to say the indictment was, upon their oaths, a fit
</p>
<p>cae to be submitted to the consideration of a jury. When, Gentle-
</p>
<p>348
</p>
<p>men, be Attorney-General comes to state the case, he occupies no
</p>
<p>less than eleven hours in that statement. We all know the powers
</p>
<p>of the Attorney-General, how remarkable he is for sententious
</p>
<p>brevity and power of condensation, yet with all bis ability, he was
</p>
<p>unable to explain the matter of the charge, or the nature of the proof
</p>
<p>in support of that charge, in a shorter space than eleven hours.
</p>
<p>What time did he take to produce his proofs of this terrible conspi-
</p>
<p>racy ? He took eight days in laying before you the evidence upon
</p>
<p>which he rested in support of this charge. So you have before you
</p>
<p>this indictment, which it will cost you hours to read, and which it
</p>
<p>would take you weeks to understand, and out of the mass of proofs,
</p>
<p>which it would baffle the memory of a Pascal to recollect, he expects
</p>
<p>that you will extract for him a case of conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, there never did exist a more dangerous doctrine to the li-
</p>
<p>berties of a people than that doctrine of constructive crime; and I warn
</p>
<p>you tobeware of it. Constructive treason has heretofore been attempted,
</p>
<p>and th is is an effort made to introduce construed veconspiracy ; and you are
</p>
<p>called upon to construct a crime out of the mass of documents and evi-
</p>
<p>dence laid before you. Various attempts have been made in England to
</p>
<p>introduce the doctrine of constructive treason ; but they failed. In the
</p>
<p>case of Hardy, in 1794, the charge against him was that of treason,
</p>
<p>and the overt act that he was guilty of conspiracy. The mode of
</p>
<p>proceeding, in that case, was precisely the same as the present, and
</p>
<p>lias been adopted by the Attorney-General as a precedent for this
</p>
<p>proceeding. He founded this case on it, and carried out the details
</p>
<p>in the same manner as they had been carried out in that case. The
</p>
<p>then Attorney-General produced evidence of a multitude of meetings,
</p>
<p>a large quantity of publications, extracts from letters and speeches ;
</p>
<p>and having spent hours in stating it, and days in the attempt to prove
</p>
<p>it, when the case came before an English jury, who are at all
</p>
<p>times willing to punish the man who violates the law, they had no
</p>
<p>hesitation in pronouncing, and giving it as their verdict, that they
</p>
<p>could not construct a conspiracy. The same took place in Home
</p>
<p>Tooke's case also, which was referred to by Mr. Sheil ; and in Hunt's

</p>
<p>case. In every case, an English jury came to the conclusion that
</p>
<p>they would not be acting fairly and conscientiously in spelling out and
</p>
<p>inferring criminality upon such grounds as those which were urged in
</p>
<p>these cases. And yet, if you will take the trouble of reading them,
</p>
<p>you will find the evidence the same as it is here. I trust you will
</p>
<p>follow the uniform example of English jurors, and that you will not
</p>
<p>guess, conjecture, and construct a conspiracy for the Attorney-Gene-
</p>
<p>ral ; he had a plain, obvious, and direct course to take ; he has avoided
</p>
<p>that course, and preferred adopting this tortuous one of conspiracy,
</p>
<p>the subject matter of the present indictment. But observe, Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, the gross oppression of this proceeding as to my client. There
</p>
<p>is no evidence that he ever knew or ever saw any of the other traver-
</p>
<p>sers until the 3rd of October, when he attended a meeting of the Re-
</p>
<p>peal Association in Dublin. You will not forget that every meeting
</p>
<p>which has been proved, took place before then ; and it is not even
</p>
<p>349
</p>
<p>alleged that Mr. Tieiney was at any one of them. It i3 not pretended
</p>
<p>that he ever heard a syllable of any of the speeches on those occa-
</p>
<p>sions, or that he ever had even read, much less concurred, in any one
</p>
<p>of the publications which have been laid before you; and yet they are
</p>
<p>all adduced as evidence against him. I beg to remind you that the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General has not told you when or where the agreement,
</p>
<p>which constitutes the conspiracy, took place ; he has taken the whole
</p>
<p>of Ireland as the scene of his operations ; he has left you to select the
</p>
<p>spot where the agreement was entered into ; he has given you a pe-
</p>
<p>riod of nine months, and you are to make choice of any day or week
</p>
<p>you think fit. I ask you is this a definite or specific charge which
</p>
<p>any man ought to be called on to answer? How is Mr. Tierney to
</p>
<p>defend himself against such a charge ? Is he to travel over Ireland,
</p>
<p>to visit the place of every meeting, to acquaint himself and to instruct
</p>
<p>his counsel as to every occurrence that took place there. Is he to
</p>
<p>read every speech that was made, to study every newspaper that
</p>
<p>is stated in the indictment, and be prepared to show that every
</p>
<p>speech and every publication was innocent. To require from my
</p>
<p>client that he should do so, is to ask him to effect an impossi-
</p>
<p>bility. It is fair that every man should be prepared to justify what
</p>
<p>he himself has done or said, or what has been done or said by others,
</p>
<p>when sanctioned by his presence ; but is it fair to ask Mr. Tieiney to
</p>
<p>justify the acts or language of others during a period of nine months,
</p>
<p>of which he was totally ignorant, and to tell him that if he does not
</p>
<p>do so, he is to be convicted as a conspirator ? But, Gentlemen, let
</p>
<p>me ask you on general grounds, is not the charge of conspiracy most
</p>
<p>improbable? When any man is accused of a crime, the first natural
</p>
<p>suggestion is, to inquire into his character, his rank, and situation of
</p>
<p>life, his powers of judging, and how far it was likely he would be
</p>
<p>guilty of the offence charged against him. Make those inquiries
</p>
<p>here. Who are the traversers ? They are all men of talents and edu-
</p>
<p>cation. Allow me to select one, Mr. O'Connell. He is known to
</p>
<p>be a gentleman of first-rate talent, a most able lawyer, peculiarly
</p>
<p>versed in criminal law, perfectly aware of the nature of the crime of

</p>
<p>conspiracy ; and yet you are asked to believe that he rushed, with his
</p>
<p>eyes open, into the commission of that offence. Any man may inad-
</p>
<p>vertently be present at an unlawful meeting, and have to answer for
</p>
<p>the consequences ; any man may, in the heat and ardour of speaking,
</p>
<p>utter language which he may not be able to justify, but no man can
</p>
<p>inadvertently be a conspirator. It is a crime of deliberation, and you
</p>
<p>are asked to believe that one of the ablest and most experienced
</p>
<p>lawyers of his time has deliberately become a conspirator. But
</p>
<p>again, it is almost of the essence of conspiracy to be secret; the con-
</p>
<p>spirator usually moves in darkness. Is that the case here? Has
</p>
<p>there been any secrecy or concealment on the part of Mr. Tierney or
</p>
<p>any of the traversers ? Has not every part of their conduct been as
</p>
<p>open as day ? The proofs of conspiracy are meetings, speeches, and
</p>
<p>publications. The meetings are openly and publicly announced, the
</p>
<p>time and place fixed ; the speeches are uttered in the presence of
</p>
<p>350
</p>
<p>thousands, the publications are to be found in the newspapers of the
</p>
<p>day. I ask again, is this the conduct of conspirators ? The meet-
</p>
<p>ings may have been illegal, the speeches seditious, the publications
</p>
<p>libellous; and if that be so, let each man be indicted for what he has
</p>
<p>done, said, or published, and let him undergo the consequences ;
</p>
<p>but do not implicate my client with acts and language in which he
</p>
<p>never participated, or find him guilty for the conduct of others over
</p>
<p>whom he had no control. Therefore, Gentlemen, upon this part of
</p>
<p>the case, I confidently submit, that you are not warranted in finding
</p>
<p>that a conspiracy or agreement ever existed between the traversers.
</p>
<p>If you adopt that view, there is an end to the case, and you are
</p>
<p>bound to acquit all the traversers; if you cannot adopt that view, I
</p>
<p>then come to the second branch of the case, and I do unhesitatingly
</p>
<p>assert that there is not the slightest ground contained in the evi-
</p>
<p>dence, that my client ever engaged in this conspiracy, if it ever ex-
</p>
<p>isted.
</p>
<p>It is necessary for me to tell you who my client is. He is the
</p>
<p>Roman Catholic clergyman of the parish of Clontibret, in the county
</p>
<p>of Monaghan. He is a gentleman, as I am instructed, of most exem-
</p>
<p>plary private character, both as a private individual and a clergyman.
</p>
<p>He has^filled that situation for a considerable time, and I will venture
</p>
<p>to say, from what I have heard, that no imputation of any kind can
</p>
<p>be cast upon his private character, either as a gentleman or a clergy-
</p>
<p>man. Gentlemen, it is also right to tell you what his political opi-
</p>
<p>nions are. He is a man of talent and education, and deeply interested
</p>
<p>in the welfare of his country. He has studied the history of Ireland,
</p>
<p>and devoted his attention to the question of the Union, and has brought
</p>
<p>his mind, whether right or wrong, to the conclusion, that it was a
</p>
<p>measure which was disastrous not only to the independence but to the
</p>
<p>welfare and prosperity of this country. The question is not whether
</p>
<p>he was right or not in coming to that conclusion. You may differ
</p>
<p>with him in opinion. I only state that he has come to the firm and
</p>
<p>conscientious conviction, that the Union is an injurious measure, and
</p>
<p>should be repealed. Does any man say, or pretend to say, he has
</p>

</p>
<p>not a right to entertain that opinion? Are there any particular pri-
</p>
<p>vileges attached to the Act of Union, to prevent men forming opi-
</p>
<p>nions hostile to it ? There is no particular inviolability hedging that
</p>
<p>Act, to guard and protect it. It is the same as any other Act of
</p>
<p>Parliament, and Mr. Tierney had a perfect legal and constitu-
</p>
<p>tional right to entertain the opinion, that that measure was inju-
</p>
<p>rious, and a measure which should be repealed. He has also a
</p>
<p>right to express that opinion, and can, or does any man contro-
</p>
<p>vert that right? It is the constitutional right of every man to
</p>
<p>express and advocate the opinion, that the Union ought to be re-
</p>
<p>pealed, if that be his deliberate conviction ; nay, I will go further, it
</p>
<p>is not only his right, but his bounden duty to do so, and no honest
</p>
<p>man, no honest Irishman, who had a particle of regard for the wel-
</p>
<p>fare of his country, who ought not, if he brought his mind to the
</p>
<p>conscientious conviction that the Union was injurious, to use every le-
</p>
<p>351
</p>
<p>gitimate effort in his power for the advancement of that which he con-
</p>
<p>sidered beneficial to his country. No man should hesitate for a mo-
</p>
<p>ment if he believed the measure to be injurious, if he believed that on
</p>
<p>the altar of the Union was sacrificed the independence and welfare of
</p>
<p>Ireland, to exert himself by every legitimate means to set it aside,
</p>
<p>and he would be bound by every principle which should guide a man
</p>
<p>in his conduct, to omit no legitimate effort to obtain what he consi-
</p>
<p>dered necessary for the welfare of his country. Gentlemen, you will
</p>
<p>not consider me as discussing the question of the Repeal of the
</p>
<p>Union. I do not mean to offer any argument for or against the mea-
</p>
<p>sure, it is not my province or your's to do that, but I allude to it on
</p>
<p>this single ground, to convince you of the honesty and sincerity of
</p>
<p>the opinions which Mr. Tierney had formed and expressed. The At-
</p>
<p>torney-General has felt it necessary for the purposes of his case, to
</p>
<p>lay before you grounds to make you doubt, if you could, the sincerity
</p>
<p>of those who advocated the Repeal of the Union, and he, therefore,
</p>
<p>thought it right, as is often done on such occasions, to take the ground
</p>
<p>of argument which he thought would be likely to be resorted to on
</p>
<p>the part of the traversers, and accordingly he told you that the coun-
</p>
<p>sel for the traversers would probably resort to the opinions of high
</p>
<p>and eminent men who were hostile to the Union, the opinions
</p>
<p>of Bushe and Plunket, and of Saurin. Why should not the traver-
</p>
<p>sers resort to them? Where are the Irish people to resort to for wis-
</p>
<p>dom and instruction, if not to those bright luminaries I have men-
</p>
<p>tioned ? I shall not trouble you by reading the opinions of those
</p>
<p>eminent men ; Mr. Sheil has already read them for you ; but take
</p>
<p>up any one of the speeches delivered by them, and compare the lan-
</p>
<p>guage then used with the language used by any of the advocates of
</p>
<p>Repeal, and you will find that eloquent and strong as it is, it falls far
</p>
<p>short in strength of expression of the language of those eminent men.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I will read for you a single passage from Mr. Saurin's
</p>
<p>speech, it is as follows : " You may make the Union binding as a law, but
</p>
<p>" you canuot make it obligatory upon conscience. It will be obeyed
</p>
<p>" as long as England is strong, but resistance to it will be in the ab-

</p>
<p>" stract a duty, and the exhibition of that resistance will be a mere
</p>
<p>M question of prudence." Take any of the numerous speeches laid
</p>
<p>before you in evidence, and any one of the many publications read,
</p>
<p>and you will not find a proposition so strong in thought or language,
</p>
<p>as that which I have quoted for you. I ask you, Gentlemen, do you
</p>
<p>doubt the sincerity of those eminent men ? Do you doubt the sin-
</p>
<p>cerity of Chief Justice Bushe, who, I regret to say, is no longer
</p>
<p>amongst us, but I may say, that his memory will ever remain en-
</p>
<p>shrined in the hearts of his countrymen ? Do you doubt the since-
</p>
<p>rity of Lord Plunket? Who ever doubted it? I rejoice to say he
</p>
<p>is still amongst us, commanding and possessing, as he ever did, the
</p>
<p>love, the respect, the reverence, the admiration of all those who have
</p>
<p>had the honour and the happiness to know him. Do you doubt the
</p>
<p>sincerity of Mr. Saurin? You have heard the panegyric which Mr.
</p>
<p>Sheil, his political opponent, passed upon him, " he may have had
</p>
<p>352
</p>
<p>his faults (said he), but hypocrisy was not among them." When you
</p>
<p>find these eminent men, not enthusiastic boys, but men in the full
</p>
<p>maturity of their intellect, placed at the top of their Profession, hold-
</p>
<p>ing seats in the legislature, and possessing a deep stake in the country
</p>
<p> when you find these eminent men expressing such decided opinions
</p>
<p>with regard to the Union  I ask you, do you doubt their sincerity ? If
</p>
<p>they had strong reasons for the opinions which they expressed  and
</p>
<p>can you doubt they had  may not those reasons still exist, and may
</p>
<p>they not have operated on the mind of Mr.Tierney, when he came to
</p>
<p>the conclusion that the Repeal of the Union was necessary for the pre-
</p>
<p>servation and happiness of his country? But, the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>went further; he endeavoured to convince you that the measure of
</p>
<p>Repeal was impracticable and unattainable. I know nothing that
</p>
<p>could result from that line of argument, but to make you doubt the sin-
</p>
<p>cerity of those who advocated the measure; and, undoubtedly, if men
</p>
<p>do look after what is impracticable or unattainable, their sincerity
</p>
<p>may be questioned ; but, Gentlemen, it appears to me monstrous to
</p>
<p>say, that any measure, after what we have all seen in our own times,
</p>
<p>should be considered as impracticable, no matter what difficulties in-
</p>
<p>terposed. How many measures of great importance in our own time,
</p>
<p>which appeared to have insuperable difficulties to contend with, which
</p>
<p>yet have become the law of the land ? You recollect the question of
</p>
<p>the Slave Trade, which Mr. Pitt denounced as the greatest stain which
</p>
<p>ever disgraced or degraded mankind ; yet that measure, supported as
</p>
<p>it was by his mighty talent, and by that of Fox and Wilberforce, and
</p>
<p>recommended by every feeling of humanity, took years before it was
</p>
<p>possible to counteract the prejudice against it, and before it became
</p>
<p>the law of the land ! The unwearied efforts of Mr. Wilberforce to
</p>
<p>accomplish that measure can never be forgotten; he devoted to it the
</p>
<p>best part of his useful life. Effort followed effort. Defeat followed
</p>
<p>defeat ; but he persevered. On his side were justice and humanity ;
</p>
<p>against him was the selfishness of human interest: he stood between
</p>
<p>both; and the Slave Trade was abolished. And if I might be allowed
</p>
<p>to use an expression of his own, " He stood between the living and

</p>
<p>the dead, and the plague was stopped." Do you forget the Catholic
</p>
<p>Emancipation Bill? You know the difficulties against which its sup-
</p>
<p>porters had to contend ; the struggles which they had to encounter.
</p>
<p>Opinions were pronounced, that it was perfectly impracticable and un-
</p>
<p>attainable ; yet that measure has become the law of the land ! Re-
</p>
<p>collect the state of that question in 1816. Its advocates had aban-
</p>
<p>doned hope, and relinquished it in despair. In that year an extraor-
</p>
<p>dinary man, who now stands a traverser at your bar, came forward
</p>
<p>and undertook the cause of his country. He saw the difficulties he
</p>
<p>had to encounter, but he also saw the duties he had to perform, the
</p>
<p>rights he had to sustain. He revived the Catholic Association ; he
</p>
<p>advanced step by step, unchilled by the apathy and indifference of
</p>
<p>those who ought to have been his friends; undismayed by the opposi-
</p>
<p>tion of those who ought not to have been his enemies, he never
</p>
<p>relaxed his efforts until he had achieved the independence of mil-
</p>
<p>353
</p>
<p>lions of his countrymen ; and will any man after this, say, that any
</p>
<p>public measure is impracticable or unattainable. There is the still
</p>
<p>more recent measure of Parliamentary reform. We know how long
</p>
<p>it took before it became the law of the land ; I therefore say, you can-
</p>
<p>not cast a doubt upon the sincerity of those men who advocated the
</p>
<p>Repeal of the Union, though in your judgment they have great and
</p>
<p>almost insuperable difficulties to struggle against. The Attorney-
</p>
<p>General has used another ground of argument to make you doubt
</p>
<p>the sincerity of the traversers, and has referred to the opinions and
</p>
<p>speeches of eminent statesmen with regard to that measure. I never
</p>
<p>expected to hear the Attorney General referring to the speeches of
</p>
<p>Lord Althorp and Lord John Russell, but, so far as they suited his
</p>
<p>purpose, he has done so ; he also referred to the more congenial
</p>
<p>opinions of Sir Robert Peel and the Duke of Wellington. These
</p>
<p>are all men of distinguished eminence, and I hereby acknowledge
</p>
<p>that every respect should be paid to the opinions of such men, but I
</p>
<p>deny that any man, or any set of men, are to be bound and con-
</p>
<p>trolled by the opinions of others, however eminent, whether they be
</p>
<p>in office or out of office. Are the opinions of statesmen immutable?
</p>
<p>Are they not at liberty to change those opinions, if they see grounds
</p>
<p>for doing so? I can refer you to one of those very eminent indivi-
</p>
<p>duals, to show you that the opinions of statesmen are not immuta-
</p>
<p>ble. You cannot but recollect that Sir Robert Peel had, for years,
</p>
<p>been the decided opponent of Catholic Emancipation ; on every oc-
</p>
<p>casion, in which it was brought forward, he opposed it with all the
</p>
<p>power of a Minister and the talent of a statesman ; in 1828, he ex-
</p>
<p>pressed a decided, unequivocal opinion hostile to it, when introduced
</p>
<p>by Sir Francis Burdett; do you doubt the sincerity of that opinion?
</p>
<p>I do not ; I believe Sir Robert Peel to have been perfectly honest
</p>
<p>and sincere. Yet, in about twelve months afterwards, that measure
</p>
<p>became the law of the land, and was even introduced, supported, and
</p>
<p>advocated by Sir Robert Peel himself.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, do I find fault with Sir Robert Peel for the change
</p>
<p>of his opinion? quite the reverse; on the contrary, I think his con-

<p>duct on that occasion, the most glorious act of his political life, and he
</p>
<p>deserves the greatest credit for it. That man would be a sorry and
</p>
<p>wretched statesman who said, that because he at one time expressed
</p>
<p>certain opinions, those opinions were immutably to bind him. In
</p>
<p>1828, and the antecedent years, Sir Robert Peel entertained an opi-
</p>
<p>nion hostile to Emancipation. But circumstances arose ; many things
</p>
<p>combined to convince him that he had been in error. Never was any
</p>
<p>political man placed in a situation of greater difficulty than Sir
</p>
<p>Robert Peel, at that time. He was the idol of a party, whose lead-
</p>
<p>ing principles were to oppose the emancipation of the Catholics; he
</p>
<p>knew the risk he was incurring, and the obloquy and censure he
</p>
<p>would be exposed to, by a change in his opinion, he knew, to use an
</p>
<p>expression of Mr. Bushe, "that he was putting to the hazard his
</p>
<p>ease, his power, his darling popularity;" but like an honest man,
</p>
<p>and an honest Minister, he had the magnanimity to risk, and even to
</p>
<p>sacrifice them all in the discharge of what his judgment told him was
</p>
<p>2z
</p>
<p>354
</p>
<p>his duty to his country, and accordingly in 1829, lie hrought forward
</p>
<p>his hill for Catholic Emancipation, and enforced it with all his power
</p>
<p>as a Minister, and all his eloquence as a man. Will any man then
</p>
<p>tell you that you should doubt the sincerity of the traversers, because
</p>
<p>eminent statesmen have expressed an opinion adverse to the measure.
</p>
<p>Gentleu en, if then you believe, that my client entertained a consci-
</p>
<p>entious opinion of the injury and injustice of the Union, I think,
</p>
<p>giving him credit for the sincerity of it, you will have an honest and
</p>
<p>constitutional motive to which you can refer his conduct.
</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen, let me come to the consideration of the acts
</p>
<p>imputed to him. If I recollect the evidence right, these acts are but
</p>
<p>two. First, attending a meeting at Clontibret, on the 15th of Au-
</p>
<p>gust ; and secondly, one at the Association, on the 3rd of October,
</p>
<p>in the same year. I believe I am correct when I say, that no act
</p>
<p>was imputed to him except upon those two occasions ; and if he is to
</p>
<p>be branded or convicted as a conspirator, it will be on one or other,
</p>
<p>or both of these two acts to which I have referred.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I will take both of them in order; but before I
</p>
<p>go to the meeting of the 15th of August, 1 must refer to a por-
</p>
<p>tion of the evidence given, with regard to an alleged conversation
</p>
<p>which had taken place between Mr. Tierney and M'Cann, who wa3
</p>
<p>produced as a witness. That conversation is stated to have taken
</p>
<p>place on the 16th of June ; and I had better read to you, what
</p>
<p>I think was a correct report of what was alleged to have been
</p>
<p>said at that conversation, begging you to recollect that this took
</p>
<p>place two months previous to the meeting. M'Cann told you he
</p>
<p>received instructions to go to Mr. Tierney to learn when the
</p>
<p>meeting was to be held; accordingly he went to Mr. Tierney and
</p>
<p>obtained all the information it was in that gentleman's power to
</p>
<p>afford, namely, that he did not know the precise day on which the
</p>
<p>meeting was to take place: then we are told by M'Cann, that in the
</p>
<p>course of the same conversation, Mr. Tierney adverted to the Union :
</p>
<p>that he said it had been fraudulently carried, that it was not binding
</p>
<p>on the conscience ; that he represented it to be a concoction ; that

</p>
<p>he spoke of the feeling that was becoming general among the army ;
</p>
<p>that he declared that the army was favourable to Repeal, and partook
</p>
<p>of the enthusiasm of the people, and that the army could not be so
</p>
<p>easily led to spill the blood of their fellow-men ; and that he referred
</p>
<p>to what the army had done in Spain. Now, the plain object of this
</p>
<p>evidence was to endeavour to implicate Mr. Tierney in the charge
</p>
<p>of seducing the army. I have first to say to you on the part of, and
</p>
<p>by the authority of Mr. Tierney, that he does most positively and
</p>
<p>absolutely deny that any single particle of that alleged conversation
</p>
<p>ever took place. He acknowledges that M'Cann came to get in-
</p>
<p>formation about the meeting, and that he gave him that infor-
</p>
<p>mation, but he positively denies the truth of the residue of M'Cann's
</p>
<p>evidence as to this alleged conversation. I certainly am not able
</p>
<p>to produce any witness to contradict him, and why ? because, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to the testimony of M'Cann, there was no one present but him-
</p>
<p>self and Mr. Tierney ; but I am glad, for the sake of truth and justice,
</p>
<p>355
</p>
<p>that I shall be able to convict M'Cann from his own lips, and upon
</p>
<p>such facts and circumstances, that it will be impossible that you can
</p>
<p>give one particle of credit to what has been said by him. In the
</p>
<p>first place, is it not improbable, if such a conversation took place,
</p>
<p>that a common policeman would be able to recollect the terms used,
</p>
<p>that he would be able to detail to you the apparently eloquent lan-
</p>
<p>guage in which it was carried on. Have we not this further strong
</p>
<p>improbability ? He was a policeman, not even one of the flock of
</p>
<p>Mr. Tierney, and he came dressed in uniform; is it likely that a
</p>
<p>gentleman in the rank and situation of Mr. Tierney, would have held
</p>
<p>a conversation of that kind with a common policeman. I would beg
</p>
<p>leave to direct your attention to this. Can anything be more unsafe
</p>
<p>than for juries to be acting on conversations alleged to have taken place
</p>
<p>months since? M'Cann told you he kept a diary ; that he put in that
</p>
<p>diary an account of the meeting, but he did not take any note of the
</p>
<p>conversation, and that he never mentioned it until he heard he was
</p>
<p>to be examined. Why did he make an entry of part of what had oc-
</p>
<p>curred, and not of the rest? If such conversation had taken place,
</p>
<p>and that he considered it of importance, why not commit it to
</p>
<p>writing, as he did the part relative to the meeting. Is not his omitting
</p>
<p>to do so strong evidence, either that it never occurred, or that he
</p>
<p>thought it unimportant, and if he thought it unimportant is it credible
</p>
<p>that he would have carried it in his recollection ? You will recollect
</p>
<p>that he said that a portion of the conversation was in reference to Spain ;
</p>
<p>that the army had done a great deal in Spain. Gentlemen, the army
</p>
<p>has done a great deal in Spain in later periods. It has abandoned the
</p>
<p>regular constituted authorities, and has, by its force, set up another go-
</p>
<p>vernment ; and the object of bringing forward this conversation was
</p>
<p>to endeavour to sustain that portion of the charge which imputes to
</p>
<p>the traversers an attempt to seduce the army from their allegiance.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you will recollect that this conversation is alleged to have
</p>
<p>taken place on the 16th of June. I have not myself examined the
</p>
<p>papers, but I am assured by my friends who had done so, that the
</p>
<p>first indication of a revolt, on the part of the army in Spain, took

</p>
<p>place on the 11th of June, in the city of Valencia, the next demon-
</p>
<p>stration did not take place until the day following, the 12th, at Bar-
</p>
<p>celona, and the important revolt did not take place until the 24th of
</p>
<p>June, no account of those movements could have reached this country
</p>
<p>until the 19th or 20th of June, as will appear from the newspapers of the
</p>
<p>day, so that it was utterly impossible that a person in the county of Mo-
</p>
<p>naghan could have known what had taken place until the 19th or 20th of
</p>
<p>the month. It was impossible that he could have known, on the 16th of
</p>
<p>June, what had taken place at Valencia on the 11th, and at Barcelona on
</p>
<p>the 12th ; therefore, I have strong reason to contend that this con-
</p>
<p>versation is a fabrication on the part of the policeman, and that he had
</p>
<p>sense enough to comprehend its importance as connected with the
</p>
<p>charge in the indictment, and the obvious advantage of connect-
</p>
<p>ing one of the traversers with the alleged attempt to seduce the
</p>
<p>army. He thought it might be useful to the charge of tampering with,
</p>
<p>and endeavouring to seduce the army ; but, if I am right in the
</p>
<p>35G
</p>
<p>dates, there could have been no communication with this country
</p>
<p>sooner than the 19th or 20th, yet you have this wretched policeman,
</p>
<p>on the 16th, detailing and referring to events as if they had then oc-
</p>
<p>curred. I will not waste more time on this part of the case ; I am
</p>
<p>sure you will agree with me, independent of the danger of acting on
</p>
<p>a conversation of this description, and the improbability attending it,
</p>
<p>and the clear proof that no such conversation ever took place, that
</p>
<p>I am not asking too much from you when I ask you to dismiss from
</p>
<p>your minds that alleged, and untruly alleged, conversation.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I now come to the meeting of Clontibret, which took
</p>
<p>place on the 15th of August. Who were the persons brought for-
</p>
<p>ward to give you an account of what took place at that meeting ?
</p>
<p>The only evidence produced is that of two policemen. You have
</p>
<p>heard from them that there were two Stipendiary Magistrates present.
</p>
<p>Why has not either of them been produced? Was it not the duty
</p>
<p>of the Crown, if they wanted to represent the meeting at Clontibret
</p>
<p>as an illegal meeting, to produce those best calculated to give evi-
</p>
<p>dence upon the subject? Though these two Stipendiary Magistrates
</p>
<p>were present, though they were in the pay of the Government, and
</p>
<p>under its control, though there was no difficulty on the part of the
</p>
<p>Crown, if they thought fit, in producing them, yet neither of them is
</p>
<p>produced ; but, in order to give you an account of the character of
</p>
<p>the meeting, the policemen are produced, and the magistrates kept
</p>
<p>back. Gentlemen, I wish to cast no imputation upon the Crown for
</p>
<p>so doing. I know not its motives. I know not its reasons. Yet I
</p>
<p>think that I am justified in saying this, that if those magistrates could
</p>
<p>have deposed to any single circumstance that would have been
</p>
<p>calculated to stamp the meeting with illegality, the Attorney-Ge-
</p>
<p>neral would have called them. And I am, therefore entitled to
</p>
<p>assume, that he found that those persons would not be able to say
</p>
<p>anything which would serve the prosecution, but might say something
</p>
<p>that would prejudice it. Well, Gentlemen, that meeting took place,
</p>
<p>and not one of the traversers was present at it except the Rev. Mr.
</p>
<p>Tierney. Not an iota or particle of connexion is shown between him

</p>
<p>and the other traversers up to, or at that time, yet he is alleged to
</p>
<p>have entered into a conspiracy and agreement with them. Are there
</p>
<p>any grounds for saying that this meeting was illegal ? Was there any
</p>
<p>act of violence committed ? No. Was there anything done to show
</p>
<p>that the meeting was an illegal assembly ? Not one. There was not
</p>
<p>one single particle of riot or disturbance, It was characterized by
</p>
<p>that which characterized all the other meetings ; it was perfectly tran-
</p>
<p>quil, perfectly peaceable, not a finger or hand was raised ; the utmost
</p>
<p>that is alleged is that some of the people were crushed, and among
</p>
<p>them the policeman. If, Gentlemen, the existence of a crush is to
</p>
<p>be the ground for attaching a charge of illegality to a meeting, I must
</p>
<p>say that the Court of Queen's Bench has held most illegal meetings
</p>
<p>for the last fortnight. There has certainly been a considerable degree
</p>
<p>of crushing in the court during that time, and although, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>from your peculiar situation you are guarded and protected from it,
</p>
<p>no other portion of the court has been free from crushing; I might
</p>
<p>357
</p>
<p>say that even the judgment seat has heen invaded hy those fair per-
</p>
<p>sons whom even ermined judges found it impossible to resist. The
</p>
<p>Attorney-General calls upon you to pronounce this meeting illegal,
</p>
<p>in order to connect my client with the conspiracy, for if the meeting
</p>
<p>was legal there is no ground for the charge against my client, and in
</p>
<p>order to make a particle of proof against him, it is necessary to es-
</p>
<p>tablish that this meeting was illegal. I say you have not a single par-
</p>
<p>ticle of evidence to show that this meeting was illegal. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>1 will tell you what the object of this meeting was. It was to adopt
</p>
<p>certain resolutions. The first resolution was this : " Resolved, that
</p>
<p>the Legislative Union was carried against the will of the Irish people."
</p>
<p>Look to the speeches of Lord Grey and you will find the selfsame
</p>
<p>proposition laid down by him. And after passing another resolution
</p>
<p>to much the same effect, a petition was drawn up to this effect : " that
</p>
<p>" the Legislative Union having operated to our injury, we request
</p>
<p>" your honourable house to repeal said Union." So that this meet-
</p>
<p>ing, this perfectly tranquil, this perfectly peaceable meeting, having
</p>
<p>adopted resolutions, and expressed their opinion that the measure of
</p>
<p>a Union was a bad one, and ought to be repealed, and having exer-
</p>
<p>cised an undoubted legal and constitutional right, you are called on
</p>
<p>to say that my client was engaged in an illegal conspiracy. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, you cannot do so.
</p>
<p>The meeting to which I shall next refer you, is a meeting of
</p>
<p>the Association which was held on the 3rd of October, on which
</p>
<p>occasion Mr. Tierney was present. You will recollect that up to
</p>
<p>that time, you have no evidence that he ever saw or communicated
</p>
<p>with any of the other traversers. It is not pretended or alleged that
</p>
<p>he was at any of those meetings, with respect to which evidence has
</p>
<p>been given. It is not pretended or alleged that he ever heard or
</p>
<p>knew anything of any of those speeches or publications which have
</p>
<p>been noticed, and for the first time he is brought into connexion with
</p>
<p>two of the traversers at the Repeal Association on the 3rd of October.
</p>
<p>It is true, he attended at that meeting ; true, he became a member of
</p>
<p>that Association on that occasion ; and the Attorney-General has

</p>
<p>wished you to believe that that is an illegal Association. I do not
</p>
<p>know whether it attracted your attention ; but I shall never forget the
</p>
<p>withering sneer with which he read the title of this Association ; he
</p>
<p>meant to insinuate that the "Loyal Repeal Association" is a disloyal
</p>
<p>and illegal Association. He did not venture to say so in distinct terms ;
</p>
<p>but he endeavoured to do so by a sneer. I am not a member of that
</p>
<p>Association ; perhaps I do not approve of the object they have in
</p>
<p>view ; but I do repel with indignation any attempt to cast an im-
</p>
<p>putation on it. Some of the wisest and best men in Ireland are
</p>
<p>member's of that Association; men eminent for talent, eminent in
</p>
<p>rank, in virtue, in patriotism, are members of that Association ; thev
</p>
<p>may be wrong, but they are not disloyal. On the 3rd of October
</p>
<p>1843, the Association consisted of at least 1,000,000 of members;
</p>
<p>and are you prepared to pronounce them disloyal  are you to con-
</p>
<p>sider a sneer so potent as to brand them with disloyalty ? I deny
</p>
<p>that there is anything disloyal or illegal in that Association, How do
</p>
<p>358
</p>
<p>I prove that ? I shall resort to an authority which the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General himself must acknowledge the weight of. My authority is the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General himself. This Association has now lasted for three
</p>
<p>years. It has been sitting uninterruptedly from week to week  not se-
</p>
<p>cretly, for it was open to all who thought it worth while to pay the paltry
</p>
<p>sum of one shilling ; and the Attorney-General never until now cast an
</p>
<p>imputation upon that body. He has not dared to take steps to put down
</p>
<p>this disloyal Association. He would not hesitate to do so if he dare, if
</p>
<p>the law allowed him to do so. It may be easy to sneer at it, but it is very
</p>
<p>different to bring a charge against it before a court of justice and a
</p>
<p>jury of his countrymen, and he has not dared to institute a single
</p>
<p>proceeding to impeach the legality of that Association. Is my client
</p>
<p>to be branded with the charge of conspiracy, of the worst description,
</p>
<p>merely because he attended a meeting of an Association which has
</p>
<p>subsisted for years, and to this hour, against which the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General has never dared, and I will venture to say he never will
</p>
<p>dare, to institute a prosecution. But, says the Attorney-General, he
</p>
<p>not only attended this meeting, but he gave contributions. Why,
</p>
<p>true he did so, but is there anything illegal in that ? Does the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General mean to tell you that a man may not contribute
</p>
<p>to a fund collected for the furtherance of the Repeal of the Union.
</p>
<p>If he lays down that as the law, though he may accuse me of igno-
</p>
<p>rance, I will take the liberty of asserting, that he could not legally
</p>
<p>sustain such a proposition. The Attorney-General cannot be igno-
</p>
<p>rant of the existence of similar Associations in England. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, you must know of the existence of the Anti-Corn Law League,
</p>
<p>you must know that they have collected contributions to an enormous
</p>
<p>amount, I believe to the amount of hundreds of thousands, and has
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General for England thought it his duty to institute a
</p>
<p>prosecution against them. The Marquis of Westminster has written
</p>
<p>a letter sending subscriptions to that fund, but I have not heard
</p>
<p>of his being prosecuted for such an act by the English Attorney-
</p>
<p>General. Perhaps, I am wrong in suggesting a prosecution for such
</p>
<p>an act. The meeting of Parliament is approaching. The Attorney-

</p>
<p>General for Ireland must go there for the purpose of discharging
</p>
<p>his parliamentary duties, and he will have an opportunity of communi-
</p>
<p>cating with the English Attorney-General. He owes to that distinguished
</p>
<p>legal functionary a deep debt of gratitude for the important assistance
</p>
<p>rendered him on a late occasion, and an opportunity will now be af-
</p>
<p>forded to the Attorney-General for Ireland of repaying that debt.
</p>
<p>He can, from his own experience here, instruct him in the law of con-
</p>
<p>spiracy ; he may instruct him in the power of sneering away the loy-
</p>
<p>alty of the Anti-Corn-Law League ; and when he has done so, you
</p>
<p>may perhaps see the Marquis of Westminster brought into a court
</p>
<p>of justice as a conspirator. I confess that my client attended the
</p>
<p>meeting of the 3rd of October, that he handed in subscriptions, but
</p>
<p>he did more, he made a speech, and that has been put upon record in
</p>
<p>the indictment, I suppose for the purpose of handing down that spe-
</p>
<p>cimen of eloquence to posterity. I have read that speech very atten-
</p>
<p>tively, and I find in it a long historical allusion to the parish in which
</p>
<p>359
</p>
<p>lie lived. He appears to be deeply versed in the history of that pa-
</p>
<p>rish ; he had, as might naturally be expected, a deep interest in it,
</p>
<p>and no doubt but the parish of Clonlibret stands as high in his esti-
</p>
<p>mation as the field of Blenheim or Waterloo. He then comes up to
</p>
<p>the Association, and falls into the prevailing and besetting sin of Irish-
</p>
<p>men, that of speech-making. He displays his historic lore, he dilates
</p>
<p>on the history of the parish of Clontibret, and therefore he is a con-
</p>
<p>spirator. But, says the Attorney General, he talked of deeds not
</p>
<p>words, of hands and hearts; why these are but the ordinary expres-
</p>
<p>sions of a man of sincerity, when proffering assistance. What more
</p>
<p>natural for a man to say, you shall have every assistance both of hand
</p>
<p>and heart. However, the Attorney General says, that Mr. Tierney
</p>
<p>talked of deeds, and that he meant deeds of violence; and that when
</p>
<p>he alluded to hands, he meant hands with arms in them. What right
</p>
<p>has the Attorney General to put such an interpretation upon the
</p>
<p>words of my client? On the part of my client, I repudiate such a con-
</p>
<p>struction. I deny that there was any thing in his words to warrant
</p>
<p>such a construction. It is not for you or me to pronounce with
</p>
<p>authority on the motives of any man ; this is for the Almighty
</p>
<p>alone, the great Searcher of hearts, who can alone judge of the true
</p>
<p>motives of an individual; but when man comes to judge of the mo-
</p>
<p>tives of his fellow-man, he must look to his acts and conduct alone
</p>
<p>for their elucidation. And it does appear to me to be a gross viola-
</p>
<p>tion of charity to thwart and strain the meaning of words, in order to
</p>
<p>fasten a bad motive on our fellow-being. Gentlemen, I lay these
</p>
<p>matters before you most unhesitatingly ; and without fear I confi-
</p>
<p>dently appeal to the conduct and acts of my client, and I say, without
</p>
<p>hesitation, I shall be most grievously disappointed, if you, Gentlemen
</p>
<p>of the Jury, shall come to the conclusion that my client is guilty. I
</p>
<p>have now stated to you the facts and circumstances on which I rely
</p>
<p>for your verdict in favour of my client ; and if you agree with me in
</p>
<p>the view which I have taken, and come to a conclusion that my client
</p>

<p>hereafter.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell, Q. C.
</p>
<p>My Lords, and Gentlemen of the Jury,
</p>
<p>I am counsel for Mr. Ray. Gentlemen of the Jury, I consi-
</p>
<p>der, notwithstanding what you have heard from the able and elo-
</p>
<p>quent counsel who have preceded me, and who have spoken to this
</p>
<p>case generally with respect to the charges that are made against all
</p>
<p>the traversers, and particularly with respect to their own clients ;
</p>
<p>I consider myself bound, notwithstanding what you have heard with
</p>
<p>respect to the law and facts of the case, still to address to you, on
</p>
<p>behalf of my client, a few observations. Gentlemen, I think you
</p>
<p>must feel that the ground has been preoccupied ; that there can be
</p>
<p>3G0
</p>
<p>very little indeed left for me to add to the eloquent observations of
</p>
<p>my friend Mr. Slieil on the facts and law of the ease, and the power-
</p>
<p>ful and able observations of my friend Mr. Moore, on the general
</p>
<p>charge and circumstances under which the indictment has been
</p>
<p>preferred. Still, Gentlemen of the Jury, there are circumstances
</p>
<p>peculiar to the situation of each of the traversers, which it is con-
</p>
<p>sidered right should be laid before you, in judging of the share
</p>
<p>each of them appears to have taken in those transactions, and to
</p>
<p>see if you can bring your minds, as fair, honest, and impartial
</p>
<p>jurors, to come to the conclusion from the criminal intent charged
</p>
<p>by the indictment, that those traversers, and each of them, had
</p>
<p>joined in the preconceived plan of, I may say, overturning the Go-
</p>
<p>vernment of the country. Gentlemen of the Jury, my client, Mr.
</p>
<p>Ray, is peculiarly circumstanced in relation to this charge. He
</p>
<p>is the Secretary of the Repeal Association. Before I call your at-
</p>
<p>tention to the charge as contained in the indictment, and which you
</p>
<p>have to try, permit me to call your attention (although I believe it
</p>
<p>has been already closely drawn to the question by the counsel that
</p>
<p>preceded me) to the real, substantial question which you have to try.
</p>
<p>Permit me, before I do this, to remind you of what you have not to
</p>
<p>try. Gentlemen, you are not to try Mr. Thomas M. Ray, as has
</p>
<p>been already observed, for having attended an illegal assembly. He
</p>
<p>denies that any assembly with respect to which evidence was given
</p>
<p>before you on this trial was illegal, and, if I had to defend him on
</p>
<p>that charge, I could justify him. You are not to' try whether Mr.
</p>
<p>Ray, at any one of those assemblies, at any time or place, uttered
</p>
<p>a seditious speech or published a seditious libel. If such a charge
</p>
<p>was preferred against him, I am satisfied I could perfectly justify
</p>
<p>him from it. He never published a libel in his life. He never
</p>
<p>uttered charge or accusation against any man, or against the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment. Gentlemen, you are not to try whether he be a Repealer or
</p>
<p>not. I must admit, that if you were to try him on that charge I
</p>
<p>could not defend him. He is and has been a Repealer, and is and
</p>
<p>has been the Secretary of the Repeal Association for several years.

</p>
<p>He has been the Secretary and paid officer of that Association since
</p>
<p>its institution. He became the officer, and salaried officer of it, approv-
</p>
<p>ing of its objects, mixing himself up with its proceedings, in accordance
</p>
<p>with the principles which he professed, and to sustain his opinions on
</p>
<p>that question of which you have heard so much. But, Gentlemen, I
</p>
<p>consider that when you come to try the question as to what intent Mr.
</p>
<p>Ray was a member of the Association, as to what intent he did the
</p>
<p>acts connected with that Association, as to whether he was guilty of a
</p>
<p>criminal intent, or entered into a preconcerted conspiracy, it is im-
</p>
<p>portant to consider the position in which he stood and the relation
</p>
<p>which he bore towards that Association. Gentlemen of the Jury, I
</p>
<p>need not repeat to you again, and implore you not to permit your
</p>
<p>minds to be diverted, or your attention distracted from the conside-
</p>
<p>ration of the real question you have to try. The question you have
</p>
<p>to try on your oath is, did Mr. Ray, in conjunction with all or any of the
</p>
<p>traversers, enter into a plan preconcerted, arranged, preconceived, and
</p>
<p>361
</p>
<p>laid with the criminal intent of exciting disaffection against the Go-
</p>
<p>vernment or constitution, and with the other criminal intents which
</p>
<p>are charged in the indictment. Gentlemen of the Jury, that is a ques-
</p>
<p>tion peculiarly for you  the question of intent  with what intention
</p>
<p>those proceedings took place ; what was the intention of the parties
</p>
<p>who committed or did the acts which are charged as evidence of that
</p>
<p>intention ; it is your peculiar province to judge of that intention. The
</p>
<p>Court, the Judges who preside here, it is for them to say whether the
</p>
<p>facts given in evidence are facts that ought to go before you for your
</p>
<p>consideration; they are the judges of their admissibility, or whether
</p>
<p>they should go before you as tending to sustain the charge; but it is
</p>
<p>your sole and exclusive province and duty to decide this upon your
</p>
<p>oaths, what was the intention with which those persons interfered in
</p>
<p>those transactions? With what intention those acts were done?
</p>
<p>Was it an innocent and legal intention, or the base and criminal in-
</p>
<p>tention which is charged in the indictment, to create disaffection
</p>
<p>towards the Government and constitution of the country? Permit
</p>
<p>me, in furtherance of that view, to refer to the opinion of the emi-
</p>
<p>nent Judge who charged the Grand Jury in the case of Mr.
</p>
<p>Thomas Hardy's trial. 24 St. Trials, 205. Lord Chief Justice
</p>
<p>Eyre, in calling the attention of the Jury to the question they had
</p>
<p>to try, said : " If there be ground to consider the professed purpose
</p>
<p>" of any of these associations, a reform of Parliament, as mere colour,
</p>
<p>" and as a pretext held out, in order to cover deeper designs  designs
</p>
<p>" against the whole constitution and Government of the country ; the
</p>
<p>" case of those embarked in such designs as that which I have
</p>
<p>" already considered. Whether this be so or not, is mere matter
</p>
<p>" of fact, as to which I shall only remind you, that an inquiry
</p>
<p>" into a charge of this nature which undertakes to make out that
</p>
<p>" the ostensible purpose is a mere veil, under which is concealed a
</p>
<p>" traitorous conspiracy, requires cool and deliberate examination, and
</p>
<p>" the most attentive consideration, and that the result should be per-
</p>
<p>" fectly clear and satisfactory. In the affairs of common life no man
</p>
<p>" is justified in imputing to another person a meaning contrary to what

</p>
<p>" he himself expresses, but upon the fullest evidence." You have it
</p>
<p>here laid down, on the highest authority, that no man has a right
</p>
<p>to impute to another motives contrary to what he professes; unless
</p>
<p>there is clear, satisfactory, and unambiguous evidence to show
</p>
<p>the contrary, every man must be presumed to be acting according to
</p>
<p>his declared intentions. Every man is presumed by the law of the
</p>
<p>land to be innocent before his guilt is clearly established ; and, as
</p>
<p>already observed to you by Mr. Moore, "if there be a criminal in-
</p>
<p>" tent alleged, and if there be a legal intent to which the acts of the
</p>
<p>" party can be truly attributable  common justice  the spirit of the
</p>
<p>" British law  requires that his acts should be referred to the legal
</p>
<p>" and innocent motive, and not strained to a criminal intent." You
</p>
<p>have a right to go further; according to the spirit of the British law,
</p>
<p>if it be questionable to what those motives are attributable  if there
</p>
<p>be doubt upon your minds as to the intent of the accused, he is
</p>
<p>3a
</p>
<p>3G2
</p>
<p>entitled to the benefit of such doubt, and you are bound to acquit
</p>
<p>and not to convict him of the illegal and criminal design.
</p>
<p>Now, Genlemen of the Jury, you have heard with great force of ex-
</p>
<p>pression, and great power of argument, an observation made to you al-
</p>
<p>ready on the nature of this proceeding. It has been already character-
</p>
<p>ized a" monster indictment," unprecedented in the annals of English
</p>
<p>justice or English injustice. No precedent can be found in the
</p>
<p>records of the law of England for such a proceeding as this, charging
</p>
<p>almost traitorous intentions against the parties, mixing them up in
</p>
<p>the transactions of nine months of their lives, fixing the acts of one
</p>
<p>upon the others, making each responsible for the conduct of them
</p>
<p>all, and combining those charges in a volume of overt acts  accu-
</p>
<p>sations which I say are unequalled in the history of the law. How
</p>
<p>is an individual to be competent to prepare himself for his de-
</p>
<p>fence against such multiplied accusations, for though they all tend
</p>
<p>to one, or two, or three charges of conspiracy, yet all the overt
</p>
<p>acts stated in this indictment are charged as illegal acts, to sustain
</p>
<p>the ultimate charge of conspiracy, with a criminal intent of assailing
</p>
<p>the Government and the Constitution ? Of the injustice of such
</p>
<p>a course of proceeding, as in the present case has been adopted,
</p>
<p>you have heard much. You have been told that no precedent
</p>
<p>can be found for such a prosecution as the present. There is
</p>
<p>but one case on record which bears any analogy to it, and that
</p>
<p>case is one which is a blot on English history, and one which has
</p>
<p>challenged the indignant animadversion of all intelligent men who
</p>
<p>have ever considered it  I mean the impeachment of Warren Has-
</p>
<p>tings. When, on occasion of Hardy's trial, Mr. Erskine, the eloquent
</p>
<p>advocate of the accused, came to speak of the impeachment in that
</p>
<p>case (which falls far short of the complexity and injustice of the
</p>
<p>indictment on which the present traversers have been given in charge)
</p>
<p>he expressed himself in language of no common force. Lord Ers-
</p>
<p>kine, in page 892 of the State Trials, expressed his sentiments upon
</p>
<p>such prosecutions as the present in no ordinary language. He began
</p>
<p>by quoting the sentiments of Lord Coke upon constructive treason,

</p>
<p>which are as follows : " ' And third, how dangerous it is by construc-
</p>
<p>" ' tion and analogy to make treason, where the letter of the law has
</p>
<p>" < not done it. For such a method admits of no limits or bounds, but
</p>
<p>" < runs as far and as wide as the wit and invention of the accusers,
</p>
<p>" 'and the detestation of the persons accused will carry men.' Surely,"
</p>
<p>continued Lord Erskine, " the admonition of this supereminent lawyer
</p>
<p>" ought to sink deep into the heart of every judge and every juryman
</p>
<p>" who is called to administer justice under this Statute ; above all, in
</p>
<p>" the times, and under the peculiar circumstances which assemble us in
</p>
<p>" this place. Honourable men, feeling, as they ought, for the safety
</p>
<p>" of Government, and the tranquillity of the country, and natu-
</p>
<p>" rally indignant against those who are supposed to have brought
</p>
<p>" them into peril, ought, from that very cause, to proceed with more
</p>
<p>" abundant caution ; lest they should be surprised by their re-
</p>
<p>" sentments or their fears. They ought to advance in the judgments
</p>
<p>" they form by slow and trembling steps ; they ought even to fall back
</p>
<p>3G3
</p>
<p>" and look to every thing again, lest a false light should deceive them,
</p>
<p>" admitting no fact but upon the foundation of clear and precise evi-
</p>
<p>" dence, and deciding upon no intention that does not result with equal
</p>
<p>" clearness from the fact. This is the universal demand of justice in
</p>
<p>" every case, criminal or civil  how much more especially then in this,
</p>
<p>" when the judgment is every moment in danger of being swept away into
</p>
<p>" the fathomless abyss of a thousand volumes, where there is no anchor-
</p>
<p>" age for the understanding ; where no reach of thought can look
</p>
<p>" round in order to compare their points; nor any memory be ca-
</p>
<p>" pacious enough to retain even the imperfect relation that can be
</p>
<p>" collected from them. Gentlemen, my mind is the more deeply aft'ect-
</p>
<p>" ed with this consideration by a very recent example in that monstrous
</p>
<p>" phenomenon which, under the name of a trial, has driven us out of
</p>
<p>" Westminster Hall for a large portion of my professional life. No
</p>
<p>" man is less diposed than I am to speak lightly of great state prose-
</p>
<p>" cutions, which bind to their duty those who have no other superiors,
</p>
<p>" nor any other control ; least of all am I capable of even glancing a
</p>
<p>" censure against those who have led to or conducted the impeachment,
</p>
<p>" because I respect and love many of them, and know them'to be amongst
</p>
<p>" the best and wisest men in the nation. I know them indeed so well as
</p>
<p>" to be persuaded that could they have foreseen the vast field it was
</p>
<p>" to open, and the length of time it was to occupy, they never would
</p>
<p>11 have engaged in it; fori defy any man not enlightened by the Divine
</p>
<p>" Spirit, to say, with the precision and certainty of an English judge
</p>
<p>" deciding upon evidence before him, that Mr. Hastings is guilty or
</p>
<p>" not guilty  for who knows what is before him or what is not ?  Ma-
</p>
<p>" ny have carried what they knew to their graves, and the living have
</p>
<p>" lived long enough to forget it. Indeed, I pray to God that such
</p>
<p>" another proceeding may never exist in England, because I consider
</p>
<p>" it as a dishonour to the constitution; and that it brings, by its example,
</p>
<p>" insecurity into the administration of justice. Every man in civilized
</p>
<p>" society has a right to hold his life, liberty, property, and reputation
</p>
<p>" under plain laws, that can be well understood, and is entitled to have
</p>
<p>" some limited, specific part of his conduct compared and examined

</p>
<p>" by their standard, he ought not for seven years, no, nor for
</p>
<p>" seven days, to stand as a criminal before the highest tribunal until
</p>
<p>"judgment is bewildered and confounded, to come at last, perhaps,
</p>
<p>" to defend himself broken down with fatigue, and dispirited with anx-
</p>
<p>" iely." Such was the language of Lord Erskine on that occasion,
</p>
<p>and yet in that case Mr. Hastings alone stood charged, and the ac-
</p>
<p>cusations were few compared with the accusations brought against
</p>
<p>my client. How monstrous is the injustice to which my client has
</p>
<p>been made a victim ! in being called upon to become responsible for
</p>
<p>the words and actions of other men beside himself during the period
</p>
<p>of seven months, and in which he is sought to be implicated by sug-
</p>
<p>gestion and surmise, and you are called upon to come to the con-
</p>
<p>clusion, that every thing that my client did, for which I admit him
</p>
<p>responsible, he did not, with the innocent intent which he was bound
</p>
<p>to do, and in his capacity of paid officer to the society, in the consci-
</p>
<p>entious discharge of his duties as a paid servant, but with a criminal
</p>
<p>intent to pull down the laws and the constitution of the country.
</p>
<p>3G4
</p>
<p>That you are sworn to try  at that conclusion you are required to
</p>
<p>arrive. Gentlemen, I feel embarrassed in addressing you ; I confess
</p>
<p>that I am averse to going over the same ground that Mr. Moore has
</p>
<p>traversed in his eloquent remarks, for I am apprehensive that a repe-
</p>
<p>tition of the same topics by me, instead of being of value to you or to
</p>
<p>my client, would rather have the effect of weakening the impression
</p>
<p>that must have been produced upon your minds by the admirable
</p>
<p>speech of my learned friend. But I cannot avoid offering a few remarks
</p>
<p>to which I would fain attract your most serious attention, in reference
</p>
<p>to the particular case of my client, Mr. Ray. Gentlemen, look at the
</p>
<p>position in which my client is placed, and have regard to the circum-
</p>
<p>stances by which his particular case is characterized. Mr. Ray is
</p>
<p>an humble man, with a large family, who look to him alone for
</p>
<p>support, a support derived wholly from his situation as Secretary
</p>
<p>to the Association. He was made Secretary to the Repeal Associ-
</p>
<p>ation on its formation in the year 1840, and from the day of his appoint-
</p>
<p>ment to the present hour, his time and attention have been totally en-
</p>
<p>gaged by the discharge of the duties incidental to his situation. He
</p>
<p>has not given me the slightest instructions to say that the Repeal
</p>
<p>movement did not enlist his good wishes in its favour  or that he does
</p>
<p>not, to the fullest extent, sympathise with the objects of that Associa-
</p>
<p>tion ; but what he did, he did in the discharge of the duties connected
</p>
<p>with his official character  what he did, he did in compensation for his
</p>
<p>salary as in duty bound  and yet, you are called upon to view
</p>
<p>him in the light of a conspirator, and you are told to attribute
</p>
<p>every act of his  which he has performed in requital for his emolu-
</p>
<p>ments  as an act planned and achieved with the design of subverting
</p>
<p>the law and the constitution. If the Association were an illegal
</p>
<p>society, and if it had been characterized as such by the Crown, then
</p>
<p>indeed my client, might fairly have been made responsible for all his
</p>
<p>actions in the capacity of Secretary ; but no such doctrine as this has
</p>
<p>been ever propounded ; nobody has presumed to say that the Associa-
</p>
<p>tion is illegal ; nobody could say that it is illegal. You find my client,
</p>
<p>Mr. Ray, on principle, no doubt, a Repealer, and incidentally a mem-

</p>
<p>ber of the Association ; but you also have distinct evidence to show
</p>
<p>that he is the paid officer of a perfectly legal Association. Such is the
</p>
<p>character in which he truly appears before you. You find him dis-
</p>
<p>charging the routine duties of his office, and yet you are called upon
</p>
<p>to say that his acts are not to be attributed to the due discharge of
</p>
<p>his duties ; are not to be viewed as the deeds of a paid servant,
</p>
<p>who is anxious to give value for his salary, but that they are rather to
</p>
<p>be attributed to a fell purpose existing in his mind, to outrage the laws
</p>
<p>and trample on the constitution ! You are called upon by the Crown to
</p>
<p>view his case in this artificial light. You are called upon to come to this
</p>
<p>conclusion, but as honest men, as intelligent men, as men who love jus-
</p>
<p>tice, and prize the independence of the mind  I ask you, can you come
</p>
<p>to t hat conclusion ? I think you will concur with me in thinking
</p>
<p>that Mr. Ray ought not to have been included in this indictment,
</p>
<p>lie ought never to have been made a party in the present charge ;
</p>
<p>and I cannot forbear from expressing it as my opinion, that the
</p>
<p>365
</p>
<p>Crown, in having proceeded against him, have not pursued a candid,
</p>
<p>ingenuous course either towards him or towards the other traversers.
</p>
<p>They have indicted the members of a certain Society for a criminal
</p>
<p>conspiracy, and the charge contains proceedings of the Repeal Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation as overt acts, and they have included in the indictment Mr.
</p>
<p>R ay, the salaried servant of the Association, the person who regis-
</p>
<p>tered the acts of that Society. I will not apply hard names to this
</p>
<p>proceeding; I will not go so far as to say that they were guilty of
</p>
<p>a dishonest intention, or that they could be capable of the common,
</p>
<p>paltry, pettifogging manoeuvre of cutting the ground from under the
</p>
<p>feet of the accused parties, by including the witnesses in the indict-
</p>
<p>ment. I do not mean to impute any unworthy motive to my friend,
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General, but I merely advert to it for the purpose of
</p>
<p>showing the consequences which result to the rest of the traversers
</p>
<p>from the circumstance of my client being included in the indictment.
</p>
<p>While I repudiate the idea of attributing an unworthy motive to any
</p>
<p>quarter, I am surely at liberty to demonstrate how the effect of such
</p>
<p>a proceeding as has been adopted is exactly similar to that which
</p>
<p>would have resulted, if the paltry manoeuvre to which I have al-
</p>
<p>luded had indeed been deliberately had recourse to. By including
</p>
<p>Mr. Ray in the indictment, they have deprived the other tra-
</p>
<p>versers of the benefit of his services. He was the acknowledged
</p>
<p>officer of the Society ; he had in his possession the authenticated
</p>
<p>books and documents of the Society, written in his own hand-
</p>
<p>writing ; he knew the working and machinery, so to speak, of the
</p>
<p>Society, and was, of all others, the best qualified to prove the
</p>
<p>honest and perfectly legal intentions of its members. He could
</p>
<p>have proved their objects ; and yet the evidence of this man, who
</p>
<p>could alone sustain the case of the traversers  who would be able
</p>
<p>to give the best evidence of these transactions, that man has been
</p>
<p>included in the indictment. See the manner the charge is brought
</p>
<p>forward. They might have brought Mr. Ray upon the table ; they
</p>
<p>might have called for his books, and examined the man who made
</p>
<p>the entries, and thus have furnished themselves with primary evidence

</p>
<p>of the most authentic character; but this they had not done, and the
</p>
<p>were accordingly obliged to avail themselves of the ordinary news-
</p>
<p>paper reports, which did not publish all the transactions of the meet-
</p>
<p>ing, but only such of them as appeared at the time of public interest.
</p>
<p>They thus were obliged to resort to a species of secondary evidence;
</p>
<p>and in order to make this evidence against all the traversers, they
</p>
<p>were obliged to have recourse to the left-handed management of in-
</p>
<p>cluding in the indictment, the editors of the different newspapers in
</p>
<p>which these reports were published. What was the course taken at
</p>
<p>the trial of Hard y, and of Home Tooke ? Who was the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney General of England in that day ? the late Lord Eldon, then
</p>
<p>Mr. Scott. Who was the Solicitor General of that day ? the late
</p>
<p>Lord Redesdale, subsequently Lord Chancellor of Ireland, then
</p>
<p>Mr. Mitford. How did they proceed against Home Tooke and the
</p>
<p>other members of those associations which it was the object of those
</p>
<p>prosecutions to put down ? Who was the first witness examined against
</p>
<p>366
</p>
<p>Home Tooke ? Daniel Adams, who was sworn and examined by the
</p>
<p>Counsel for the Crown. And what does he prove ? that he was the
</p>
<p>Secretary of this Society or Association, that he had held that office for
</p>
<p>ten years, that he had made the entries in the books. But the Crown
</p>
<p>may say to us here : " Oh ! do you expect that we should call a co-
</p>
<p>" conspirator ? do you expect, that we should give to your counsel the
</p>
<p>" benefit of his cross-examination ?" Gentlemen, I hold it to be a
</p>
<p>principle, a high, a noble, and inherent principle of a Crown prosecu-
</p>
<p>tion, and more particularly of a state prosecution, I hold it to be the
</p>
<p>duty of those who manage it not to discriminate, to judge, to calcu-
</p>
<p>late, to criticise in what way the evidence may be likely to atfect those
</p>
<p>who are to be prosecuted ; but it is the duty of the Crown to call all
</p>
<p>those witnesses who can depose to facts appertaining to the prosecution,
</p>
<p>and then to give the traversers the benefit of their cross-examination,
</p>
<p>if benefit is fairly to be derived from it. Now the best evidence
</p>
<p>which could be produced in this case, as to the acts and objects of the
</p>
<p>members of the Association, is Mr. Ray ; he cannot be a witness at
</p>
<p>all : I cannot call him for himself; the other traversers cannot examine
</p>
<p>him on their behalf. In Home Tooke's case the Crown did not indict
</p>
<p>the Secretary ; they examined him to show what was alleged to be an
</p>
<p>overt act of treason. Home Tooke was entitled to the cross-examina-
</p>
<p>tion of the witie^s produced by the Crown ; he had the Secretary of
</p>
<p>the Society on the table to interrogate him as to the intent and objects
</p>
<p>of it. One of his questions was: " Were the members armed with
</p>
<p>"pikes and muskets? No. Did you ever hear anything said in
</p>
<p>" the Society about pikes or muskets ? No, never in my life. Was
</p>
<p>" there such a thing as a secret committee there ? Never. Was not
</p>
<p>" every thing conducted openly and publicly ? Yes. Was there any-
</p>
<p>" thing ever took place which could lead you to believe that the
</p>
<p>" members intended to depose or kill the King ? Oh, no, never."
</p>
<p>Would I not, Gentlemen, have been entitled to ask Mr. Ray, if he
</p>
<p>was a witness on the table : " Had you any reason to suppose
</p>
<p>" that the Members of the Royal National Repeal Association
</p>
<p>" intended to excite disaffection towards the Government, or

</p>
<p>" to corrupt the army, to affect the administration of justice, or to
</p>
<p><' overthrow the Government ?" Why have we not the opportunity of
</p>
<p>asking those questions, which we might have done if we had the be-
</p>
<p>nefit of his testimony. Such was the course that was taken when
</p>
<p>those prosecutions were being carried on in England, at a time when
</p>
<p>the armies of France were sweeping the continent of Europe, and
</p>
<p>when there were great dissensions at home among the people of Eng-
</p>
<p>land. The Attorney-General and Solicitor General of that clay put
</p>
<p>the Secretary of the Association upon the table in order that he
</p>
<p>might prove the facts, in order that the truth might be ascertained.
</p>
<p>Truth prevailed, and Home Tooke was acquitted. What more ques-
</p>
<p>tions were put to him ? " What did you think was the object or in-
</p>
<p>u tention of the greater part of the members of that Society ? To
</p>
<p>" obtain parliamentary reform. " Do you think there were many
</p>
<p>" among them who meant more than what they said ? I do not ; I
</p>
<p>" believe they meant what they said." Gentlemen of the Jury, I will
</p>
<p>not go further with this examination. It bears exactly on the com-
</p>
<p>367
</p>
<p>plaint I make, that the Crown should not have included my client in the
</p>
<p>indictment  the Secretary of the Repeal Association, who discharged
</p>
<p>his duties in the ordinary way that the officer of any public society
</p>
<p>was bound to do ? Why is he included in this indictment, or why
</p>
<p>is he now called upon, after having been permitted for seven months
</p>
<p>past to go on discharging the duties of his situation, to answer
</p>
<p>here as a conspirator, as one responsible for all the acts, speeches, and
</p>
<p>publications of which you have heard so much ? Can you on
</p>
<p>your oaths, as honest and honourable men, say, in the face of the
</p>
<p>country, that Ray, the official of a legal, a recognized Association,
</p>
<p>did not discharge his duties as Secretary in accordance with the di-
</p>
<p>rections of those by whom he was employed ; but that he exceeded
</p>
<p>his instructions, and combined in doing all those overt acts which
</p>
<p>form the charge of conspiracy against him. You are called upon
</p>
<p>to say that he did not do these things with the intention of discharging
</p>
<p>his duty, consistently with his principles; but that he was engaged in
</p>
<p>a preconcerted plot  in a settled conspiracy  to carry out the intents
</p>
<p>charged in the indictment. You are to swear upon your oath that you
</p>
<p>you believed such to have been his intent before you can give a verdict
</p>
<p>against him, and I am to get your answer to that plain question out of
</p>
<p>your jury-box. It may be said that Mr. Ray went beyond the regular
</p>
<p>course of his duty ; it may be said that he did not confine himself
</p>
<p>to attending the regular meetings of the Association, in his capacity
</p>
<p>of Secretary. I am ready to admit, on the part of Mr. Ray, that when-
</p>
<p>ever there was a meeting of the Association, qua Association it-
</p>
<p>self  he attended and officiated as Secretary, and that gets rid of all
</p>
<p>questions in respect to the meetings in Dublin. But it may be alleged
</p>
<p>that he was present at Tara, and at Mullaghmast. Now, on that subject
</p>
<p>I have ascertained the fact, that those were the only two county meet-
</p>
<p>ings at which he was ever present. The meeting at Tara took place
</p>
<p>the 15th of August; it was, I believe, chiefly an assemblage of per-
</p>
<p>sons from that immediate neighbourhood ; but very many of them
</p>
<p>were from the county and city of Dublin, many attracted there from
</p>
<p>curiosity as to what was to take place, and many more, of course,

</p>
<p>from an identity of feeling with the object for which it was convened,
</p>
<p>and from a wish to give expression to their feelings on the question
</p>
<p>of Repeal. I do not know whether you are aware of it, but 1 believe
</p>
<p>the fact is notorious, that from the number of persons who were going
</p>
<p>out of Dublin that day, it was regarded as a species of holiday through
</p>
<p>the city. Mr. Ray went there with his family, with the females of
</p>
<p>his family, and in company with the members of another gentleman's
</p>
<p>family, of whom one or two were females, to see this great sight.
</p>
<p>He did nothing there; he made no speech there; he did not act as
</p>
<p>Secretary, and taking that fact alone of his attendance there, the Crown
</p>
<p>might as well have included in the indictment every other person who
</p>
<p>attended there as Mr. Ray. There can be no doubt but thousands went
</p>
<p>there from a mere feeling of curiosity. However, we now find Mr. Ray
</p>
<p>at Tara, and as far as I can see, with respect to Mr. Ray as a traverser,
</p>
<p>on that head I have nothing requiring me to justify on his part. He
</p>
<p>may have gone there with a sympathy for the objects of the meeting ;
</p>
<p>368
</p>
<p>but that is no legal ground for attaching to him the character of a con-
</p>
<p>spirator to seduce the army and overturn the Government. I shall not
</p>
<p>go into any of the particulars of that meeting, for its peaceable cha-
</p>
<p>racter has been deposed to by the magistrates and policemen who
</p>
<p>were present ; they have told you that there was no riot, no breach
</p>
<p>of the peace, and no tendency to anything like it there. To be
</p>
<p>sure Captain Despard was examined for that purpose; but what
</p>
<p>was his evidence ? Why was it given ? I will tell you : it was
</p>
<p>an attempt to give a certain colouring to this case ; a colour of ille-
</p>
<p>gality to that great meeting, and that you might draw inferences from
</p>
<p>that evidence after obtaining a colouring for it. Well, then, Walker
</p>
<p>was examined, and what did he prove ? That he saw persons as-
</p>
<p>sembled, heard bands playing, and saw a few flags or banners, and
</p>
<p>that was all he saw. W r as there anything illegal in that ? Walker
</p>
<p>was examined by the Crown to everything he could depose. Then
</p>
<p>comes that smart gentleman, Captain Despard ; he said that he was
</p>
<p>no Repealer, that he had no great regard or esteem for Mr. O'Connell ;
</p>
<p>for what reason, I suppose he best knows himself. But it was quite
</p>
<p>clear that, from his manner and evidence, he had a very strong feel-
</p>
<p>ing against Mr. O'Connell and the meeting. This Captain Despard
</p>
<p>comes from Trim, and he swears he heard the people say " Keep the
</p>
<p>step '." I asked him did they keep the step, and he said they did
</p>
<p>not. I must here remark, that every policeman who was examined
</p>
<p>did, either by design or accident, endeavour in the strongest man-
</p>
<p>ner to give a colour, which they were not warranted in giving, to
</p>
<p>the movements of the persons assembled. Captain Despard said,
</p>
<p>that the bands were dressed like the 54th band, and that the people
</p>
<p>came in marching order to the meeting, and by that word he wanted to
</p>
<p>give to the meeting something of a military character. He was obliged
</p>
<p>to admit that the people did not keep the step, nor did they know how
</p>
<p>to keep it. He was a military man, and he at once committed himself
</p>
<p>in his anxiety to colour the case, and give a turn to the whole proceedings,
</p>
<p>which was utterly inapplicable to the state of facts. It was most disin-
</p>
<p>genuous in^Despard to use a militaryterm for the purpose of throwing

</p>
<p>it into your box ; but, at the same time, it only proves the nature of
</p>
<p>his temper, and the bias of his mind, and his partizanship on the sub-
</p>
<p>ject. I will ask, are men to be branded with being foul conspirators,
</p>
<p>are their lives, liberties, and fortunes to be at stake in consequence
</p>
<p>of such evidence as this that I have shown you ? The gallant Captain
</p>
<p>Despard and Major Westenra were taken for foreigners, " because,"
</p>
<p>says the Captain, " Major Westenra had a moustache, and I had a curl
</p>
<p>in my lip." Well, he gets into a conversation with a country fellow
</p>
<p>who thought he might indulge in a little pleasant conversation with the
</p>
<p>foreigner while waiting to see Mr. O'Connell pass, and because of this
</p>
<p>conversation the meeting was stigmatised as illegal. The man told him
</p>
<p>he came from Wexford, and therefore the meeting was illegal, and the
</p>
<p>traversers guilty of a foul conspiracy. I think the Attorney General
</p>
<p>knew nothing at all about this alleged conversation when he opened the
</p>
<p>case, orifhe did, I think hedid well toleaveitout, and not contaminate
</p>
<p>his case, bad as it was, with such trash as I allude to. The Attorney
</p>
<p>369
</p>
<p>General did not allude to 2000 Shilmalier men who marched to Tara
</p>
<p>for the purpose of creating a rebellion. Oh, no, the good sense of the
</p>
<p>Attorney General repudiated it, he knew it would be really too far-
</p>
<p>cical to adopt it. The conversation to which he referred, if ever
</p>
<p>such took place at all, must have been treated as a mere joke, or
</p>
<p>a humbug, by every person but Captain Despard, whose zeal outran
</p>
<p>his discretion. Walker, who gave his evidence fairly and quietly,
</p>
<p>and who was next Captain Despard when the conversation took place,
</p>
<p>is not asked a word about it. If they did not consider it a mere
</p>
<p>bagatelle bantering of Captain Despard by the countryman, would it
</p>
<p>not have been stated by the Attorney General, would it not have
</p>
<p>been disclosed by the evidence of Walker, and then corroborated
</p>
<p>by Captain Despard ? Why is not Major Westenra produced, who
</p>
<p>might also have corroborated him as to the character and object of
</p>
<p>this conversation ? It is plain the Attorney-General never thought
</p>
<p>of introducing this episode about the 2000 Wexford men. I have
</p>
<p>merely adverted to this transaction, because Mr. Ray was present at
</p>
<p>this meeting, as it is not my intention to make any remarks relative
</p>
<p>to the other meetings, because Mr. Ray only attended those
</p>
<p>at Tara and Mullaghmast, and I will leave them to other hands. I
</p>
<p>shall only add this further observation as to that piece of evidence of
</p>
<p>Major Despard, that the traversers' counsel thought that we might
</p>
<p>have objected to the reception of this evidence, but we apprehended
</p>
<p>that an objection to its admissibility would give it a weight and im-
</p>
<p>portance it did not deserve. The only other meeting at which Mr.
</p>
<p>Ray attended was that at Mullaghmast. He went there, not in
</p>
<p>his capacity as Secretary to the Association, but on an invitation
</p>
<p>which was conveyed to him from the Committee. He was at the
</p>
<p>dinner which took place in the evening; and that was the only
</p>
<p>place in the whole history of the transaction that Mr. Ray made a
</p>
<p>speech or said a word. Well, let us see under what circumstances
</p>
<p>he went there, and made the speech. Everything done at the din-
</p>
<p>ner was given in evidence except that speech of Mr. Ray. In the
</p>
<p>course of the evening certain toasts were proposed, and amongst the

</p>
<p>rest was the " Loyal National Repeal Association." Mr. Ray spoke
</p>
<p>to the toast, but how ? Did he volunteer to speak? No; he did
</p>
<p>not ; he was called on to reply to the toast as the Secretary of the
</p>
<p>Association, and he made some observations on that occasion, but of so
</p>
<p>little importance were those observations that they were not even
</p>
<p>reported. The speech was not reported, nor was it given in evi-
</p>
<p>dence on the part of the Crown  it was merely stated that Mr. Ray
</p>
<p>returned thanks on the part of the Association, and that was the only
</p>
<p>time, in the history of the whole transaction, that Mr. Ray made a
</p>
<p>speech. In speaking of the meeting at Mullaghmast, I think this is
</p>
<p>the time to make a few observations with regard to something which
</p>
<p>occurred at that meeting. What was the first resolution passed at
</p>
<p>that meeting ? The first resolution declares loyalty to the Throne,
</p>
<p>and a determination to uphold the prerogative of the Crown, as gua-
</p>
<p>ranteed by the constitution. That was the first resolution moved at
</p>
<p>the meeting, which is one of the overt acts laid as disclosing the
</p>
<p>3B
</p>
<p>370
</p>
<p>criminal intents of the parties to excite disaffection among her Ma-
</p>
<p>jesty's subjects. You have had a great deal of evidence laid before
</p>
<p>you as to the numerous assemblage of persons who came together
</p>
<p>at Mullaghmast, but though numerous, it was proved that this meet-
</p>
<p>ing, like the others, was peaceable and orderly, and that there
</p>
<p>was not the slightest tendency to commit a breach of the peace.
</p>
<p>But it was deemed necessary, as in the case of Tara, to get some
</p>
<p>species of evidence reflecting on the character of the meeting, and on
</p>
<p>the designs and objects of those who were assembled there. I call
</p>
<p>attention to this fact, because it is one which, 1 regret to say, dis-
</p>
<p>closes a management and distortion which ought to be absent from a
</p>
<p>trial of this description, where everything should be above board, and
</p>
<p>straightforward. What do I allude to? I allude to the catch-penny
</p>
<p>ballad or placard, published and printed by a person named Hanvey,
</p>
<p>whom it was the bounden duty of the Crown to have produced. If
</p>
<p>it were a case of common assault, where there might be a struggle
</p>
<p>for a forty-shilling verdict to carry costs, I would understand why he
</p>
<p>was not produced ; but in a state prosecution, and particularly in a
</p>
<p>state Crown prosecution, I deny that he ought to be kept back.
</p>
<p>When the Attorney-General opened this case, he said that these
</p>
<p>seditious, infamous, and disgraceful publications were circulated by
</p>
<p>thousands and tens of thousands for the purpose of exciting one
</p>
<p>nation against the other, and that my client and the other traversers
</p>
<p>fabricated the document, and had it circulated. Why should not
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General produce the person who circulated them, that
</p>
<p>we might ascertain where he got them, and who paid for them. We
</p>
<p>objected to the document, we thought it unjust to be produced in evi-
</p>
<p>dence on a conspiracy, where it was sought to make each conspirator
</p>
<p>responsible for the acts of his co-conspirators. W T as it to be endured,
</p>
<p>that such a document, circulated by this person, whose character was
</p>
<p>blackened as a vender of seditious publications in the outskirts of the
</p>
<p>meeting, for profit and hire, should be received in evidence, and the
</p>
<p>person himself not produced. Mr. Brown, who was the regular and
</p>
<p>recognized printer of the Association, who printed the Repeal War-

</p>
<p>dens' Instructions, and a variety of documents for which he was paid,
</p>
<p>was produced. The Crown had the benefit of his evidence ; but
</p>
<p>why did the Attorney General close his case, having this docu-
</p>
<p>ment in his possession, without calling the person who sold them,
</p>
<p>to show how he got them ; whether he was a member of the Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation, or who paid for them ? Yet the Attorney General calls
</p>
<p>on you to assume, to infer, and presume, that this printer was a
</p>
<p>member of the Association. If the object of the Crown was to ar-
</p>
<p>rive at the truth, it was their bounden duty to produce this seditious
</p>
<p>vender of infamous publications. Do you think that Mr. Kemmis,
</p>
<p>the respectable Solicitor for the Crown, than whom no man dis-
</p>
<p>charges his duty more faithfully and more respectably, was not in-
</p>
<p>structed as to who he was, and what he was. Why, I again repeat,
</p>
<p>was not this vender of sedition produced? He could have told us
</p>
<p>whether he was a member of the Association, or from what old his-
</p>
<p>tory he drew his account. But my learned, acute, clever friends,
</p>
<p>371
</p>
<p>perfectly understood their business. Every one knows, that even at
</p>
<p>the assizes, such songs and publications were sold by wretched pau-
</p>
<p>pers, at the corners of the streets. I could not suppose that the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney General would have suggested any course that should have the
</p>
<p>effect of making the traversers fall into a trap, or one by which they
</p>
<p>would be compelled to call a witness, of whom the traversers knew
</p>
<p>nothing, and of whom the Crown might possibly know much. Such an
</p>
<p>imputation was utterly unworthy of them, and I shall only be brought to
</p>
<p>think so, if I shall hear the Solicitor General say, in his reply, that
</p>
<p>the traversers ought to call, as their witness, this vender of sedition.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, Mr. Moore has observed to you on the principles
</p>
<p>on which a British jury should decide. I can well understand that
</p>
<p>an indictment for a conspiracy might be justifiable, or the only pro-
</p>
<p>ceeding by which individuals could be punished in certain cases, as in
</p>
<p>proceeding against private individuals for doing a private wrong, it
</p>
<p>might be necessary to indict persons for a conspiracy. Two persons
</p>
<p>might conspire to rob a man of his property, and in such a case, the
</p>
<p>concert of their acts might be taken as the only evidence of their con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. Men might be charged with offences of another character,
</p>
<p>and an indictment for conspiracy might here too be the only remedy.
</p>
<p>But the law and the Constitution will look with jealousy on the doctrine
</p>
<p>of conspiracy when they see it resorted to as a political instrument in
</p>
<p>a state prosecution ; and I again repeat, that it becomes a still more
</p>
<p>obnoxious proceeding  one to be discarded and scouted from a Court
</p>
<p>of Justice, when an indictment is founded on three hundred sepa-
</p>
<p>rate accusations, each one of which might have been in itself made
</p>
<p>the groundwork of a prosecution, if the Crown had thought fit to se-
</p>
<p>lect that mode of proceeding. In the case of Henry Hunt, 3 B.
</p>
<p>& Aid. 566, before referred to, it was an indictment against Hunt
</p>
<p>and nine others, on three counts, for a conspiracy to disturb the peace
</p>
<p>and tranquillity of the country, and to excite discontent, disaffection,
</p>
<p>and hatred of the law among his Majesty's subjects. The fourth
</p>
<p>count of the indictment was for their attending an unlawful assembly.
</p>
<p>Among other facts which were proved, it appeared that bodies of

</p>
<p>persons attending the meeting at Manchester, appeared in military
</p>
<p>array, with the step and movement, of a military march. This might
</p>
<p>perhaps, account for the anxiety of some of the witnesses to prove
</p>
<p>the military character of the processions to some of the meetings; it
</p>
<p>was in order to bring them within the principle of this count against
</p>
<p>Mr. Hunt and his companions. The result of that trial was, that five
</p>
<p>were convicted and five were acquitted, though the object of the
</p>
<p>Crown was to get them all convicted of the conspiracy. How did
</p>
<p>they escape the meshes of the net? Because the jury took it for
</p>
<p>granted that the conduct of the five convicted men ought to be
</p>
<p>visited on themselves alone ; and they were not satisfied that any
</p>
<p>preconceived plan of conspiracy was proved out of subsequent trans-
</p>
<p>actions ; and these five were convicted, not for conspiracy, but for
</p>
<p>attending an illegal assembly. The jury repudiated, as dangerous
</p>
<p>to the Constitution, this indicting for conspiracy. Then why was
</p>
<p>there not a count in this indictment against the traversers for alten-
</p>
<p>372
</p>
<p>ding an illegal meeting? Gentlemen, the Crown want a conviction
</p>
<p>for a conspiracy, and therefore they would not insert a count for attend-
</p>
<p>ing an unlawful assembly ; they thought that if you had that alternative
</p>
<p>you would only find those guilty under that count who did attend
</p>
<p>such meetings, and acquit them of the charge of conspiring. There
</p>
<p>is another case which shows the same spirit in a British jury, to ad-
</p>
<p>minister the laws upon sound, safe, rational, and intelligent principles.
</p>
<p>It was that of The Queen v. Vincent and others, reported in 9 Carring-
</p>
<p>ton & Payne. This, too, was a conspiracy to disturb the peace, and cre-
</p>
<p>ate discontent and disaffection ; the jury rejected the counts for a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy ; yet, at the meetings in this case, the people were told : " if any
</p>
<p>policeman should dare to interfere with you, break his head." How
</p>
<p>different was the conduct at all the meetings held by the traversers ?
</p>
<p>At that meeting, Mr. Vincent made use of the following words: "To
</p>
<p>your tents, O Israel." It is not for me toputany construction upon those
</p>
<p>words. They seemed to be a favourite quotation, and were mentioned
</p>
<p>by Mr. Sheil as having been used. In another speech on another
</p>
<p>occasion, Mr. Vincent also said: " One heart and one blow ; perish
</p>
<p>" the privileged orders, and up with the Government which the peo-
</p>
<p>" pie have established." This was the language used at that meet-
</p>
<p>ing, and yet the jury were not of opinion that the acts of the ac-
</p>
<p>cused were to be attributed to any preconceived plan, or con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, but arose at the moment out of the proceedings of the
</p>
<p>meeting. They believed that the meeting was illegal. They
</p>
<p>acquitted them of the conspiracy, and found them guilty only of at-
</p>
<p>tending the unlawful assembly. I now come back to Mr. Ray, and
</p>
<p>on his part I call on you to go with me in saying, that there is no
</p>
<p>act of conspiracy to be attributed to him in any part of this charge.
</p>
<p>These meetings were not illegal: and, independently of that, Mr.
</p>
<p>Ray attended them only as the Secretary of the Association ; and I
</p>
<p>call on you as honourable men, to say, whether you can reconcile
</p>
<p>it to your consciences, or say on your oaths, whether in what he
</p>
<p>said, or in the character in which he appeared, there was anything
</p>
<p>of the criminal intention ascribed to him in the indictment. He

<p>would not have discharged the duty he owed to himself and to his
</p>
<p>country ; he would not have asserted the principles he avowed and
</p>
<p>entertained, or have fulfilled his duty as the servant of the Asso-

</p>
<p>TUESDAY, January 30th.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon, Q. C.
</p>
<p>J fit /dense your Lordships,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, in this case  on this, the beginning of the four-
</p>
<p>teenth day of this trial  the duty falls upon me of addressing you on
</p>
<p>373
</p>
<p>behalf of one of the traversers, Dr. Gray. From the course adopted
</p>
<p>by the Crown, in thus uniting: eight individuals, and putting them to-
</p>
<p>gether on their trial, it necessarily results that each of those indivi-
</p>
<p>duals, having the privilege of making a separate defence, may be heard
</p>
<p>by his own counsel. But from the evidence that has been laid before
</p>
<p>you, and from the nature of this case, it is plainly impossible to separate
</p>
<p>the cases of these defendants, and impossible to make, with any effect,
</p>
<p>an individual and distinct case for each. It is too plain that this must
</p>
<p>be dealt with as one case. It is a charge of a joint offence, it is a
</p>
<p>charge of an offence that cannot be committed by a single person, it
</p>
<p>is a charge of an offence in its very nature involving the necessity of
</p>
<p>more than one criminal, if any crime was committed at all. I, there-
</p>
<p>fore, Gentlemen, do not intend, nor is it the instructions of my client,
</p>
<p>that I should intend to separate the case of Dr. Gray from that of the
</p>
<p>other traversers. Gentlemen, you will observe that this is a charge
</p>
<p>against these eight defendants, that they unlawfully, and maliciously,
</p>
<p>and criminally conspired together. That seems in its nature to be
</p>
<p>rather a simple charge. The single fact of conspiring  you have
</p>
<p>been told by the Attorney-General, and it is the law  the single fact
</p>
<p>of conspiring constitutes the entire crime. Gentlemen, the crime be-
</p>
<p>ing thus really simple, it seems rather a strange thing that it should
</p>
<p>take a speech of eleven hours, evidence occupying eight days  not
</p>
<p>eight days in examining witnesses, but eight days of solid reading of
</p>
<p>documents  to make out the guilt. You will find that somewhere be
</p>
<p>tween forty and fifty hours of the time of this trial has been spent in
</p>
<p>reading. The speech being such, and the evidence being such, where
</p>
<p>is a man to begin in defending an individual from a charge thus in-
</p>
<p>volved, how is he to proceed, where is he to come to a conclusion
</p>
<p>amidst such a mass as this ? Gentlemen, I ask you, as men of sense,
</p>
<p>ought the guilt or the innocence of a fellow-subject to depend upon
</p>
<p>the chance of your being able, through this mass of matter, to arrive
</p>
<p>at a true and just conclusion on the narrow issue you have to try ?
</p>
<p>Who can be safe ? who can be defended ? what is a man to do when
</p>
<p>he is thus brought before the Court, and has thus thrown down to

</p>
<p>him this pile of heterogeneous stuff, and is told the charge against
</p>
<p>him is contained in that heap, almost without any explanation of it?
</p>
<p>This pile has been read to you in the speech of the Attorney-General,
</p>
<p>but not a word of it has been explained to you, and to this hour, now
</p>
<p>at the commencement of the fourteenth day of the trial, I venture to
</p>
<p>say not one gentleman whom I have the honour to address, knows the
</p>
<p>precise nature of the duty he has to discharge in coming to a conclu-
</p>
<p>sion on this evidence, or has the most remote apprehension of how
</p>
<p>he is to deal with this mass of evidence, in order out of it to draw
</p>
<p>any conclusion as to the guilt or innocence of the parties accused.
</p>
<p>Are you to take into your jury-room all those newspapers that have
</p>
<p>been read for you, and sit down to them ? What are you to do with
</p>
<p>them? Is it expected that you shall bear them in your memory ?
</p>
<p>What are you to do with them ? Let me ask you how you are to
</p>
<p>airive at any conclusion from such a mass of premises ? Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>374
</p>
<p>having to deal with a case thus left in confusion before you  that
</p>
<p>confusion to this hour never having been so much as approached by
</p>
<p>either the Attorney- General, nor by any of the three of my learned
</p>
<p>colleagues who have preceded me  if my friend, Mr. Sheil, in rising
</p>
<p>to address you so ably as he did in this case, to perform a duty of
</p>
<p>which he must be perfectly conscious of his complete ability  if he,
</p>
<p>intending not to approach that mass, that chaos of confusion  if he,
</p>
<p>intending to leave that altogether untouched, felt emotion at the
</p>
<p>magnitude of the duty he had to discharge, what, Gentlemen, do you
</p>
<p>suppose must be my feelings, not of emotion but of dismay, when I
</p>
<p>feel it to be my duty to approach that mass, to try and explain to you
</p>
<p>how you are to deal with it? What do you suppose must be my feel-
</p>
<p>ings, doing that in a case in which eight gentlemen stand here indicted
</p>
<p>before you for being conspirators  for being conspirators against the
</p>
<p>laws, and peace and happiness of their country ; conspirators! a name
</p>
<p>in all ages the most odious, in every clime and in every state of human
</p>
<p>society the most detestable. To be a conspirator is to be the worst of
</p>
<p>human beings  to be a conspirator is to be every thing that can be
</p>
<p>suggested of vice, of treachery, and of villany. Gentlemen, when I
</p>
<p>am here to defend these eight gentlemen, for, as I have told you, it is
</p>
<p>impossible to separate them ; when I reflect that at the head of these
</p>
<p>eight gentlemen stands one man pre-eminent in my own Profession 
</p>
<p>pre-eminent to a degree that perhaps no other man ever was in this
</p>
<p>Profession  pre-eminent for talents, pre-eminentfor, perhaps, as many
</p>
<p>of the great virtues as any other that hears me ; Gentlemen, when I
</p>
<p>have him at my hand here, to see how it is I shall, and how it is I
</p>
<p>shall not discharge this heavy duty that has fallen upon me; when I
</p>
<p>have him who, for a period of over forty years, was the ornament of
</p>
<p>his Profession within this hall ; when I have his son, a candidate
</p>
<p>in that Profession, now only entering upon it, but a candidate for
</p>
<p>honours in it  when I have him charged here  when I stand here,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, for my own client, a young man not more than twenty-
</p>
<p>eight years of age, a member too of another as learned and honour-
</p>
<p>able and useful a profession as my own  when I consider all these

</p>
<p>things, Gentlemen, and, above all, when it is recollected that I am
</p>
<p>naturally of too anxious a temperament, that I cannot approach a
</p>
<p>duty such as this, even when it is to be discharged towards the
</p>
<p>meanest fellow-creature  that I cannot approach that without an
</p>
<p>anxiety that almost disables me from the performance of it, mine,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, when you take into account these considerations, mine
</p>
<p>is no enviable position at the present moment. But there is a little
</p>
<p>more to render my place an uncomfortable one. Gentlemen, I do
</p>
<p>not approach this case with any of the abilities of an orator, I have
</p>
<p>them not ; I approach this case simply as a lawyer; and if my con-
</p>
<p>viction be that this prosecution is an unconstitutional, an illegal, and
</p>
<p>an unfair attempt, now in the year 1844, to devise a ministerial
</p>
<p>scourge for the purpose of lashing a free people into silence  if it
</p>
<p>be my opinion that the possession of this ministerial scourge is pur-
</p>
<p>sued by means illegal, unjust, and unfair, I ask you, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>375
</p>
<p>again what a duty have I placed before me. The conductors of this pro-
</p>
<p>secution, the three first men in my Profession in point of rank, these are
</p>
<p>the persons who are employed in pursuing this object. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>of all these members of my Profession, as individuals in it, so far as
</p>
<p>I have any personal knowledge of them, I will speak of them as
</p>
<p>gentlemen, severally, respectively, and individually, in the most
</p>
<p>dignified and highest possible sense of that word. As lawyers, as
</p>
<p>far as I have had to do with them, I can also say of them that they
</p>
<p>are worthy of the very highest eulogy. I speak of them as lawyers
</p>
<p>in the best sense of the word, and I should be offering- an indignity
</p>
<p>to my own Profession, were I not to avow that such an admission
</p>
<p>includes almost everything that can be said in praise of any man.
</p>
<p>But if I have spoken in such terms of those three distinguished
</p>
<p>gentlemen, I have spoken of them as I have observed them in ordi-
</p>
<p>nary matters and ordinaiy cases. It has never before been my lot,
</p>
<p>either to be concerned in, or to have witnessed in a Court of Justice
</p>
<p>a state prosecution, but it has frequently come within the range of
</p>
<p>my legal studies to read the reports of many such cases, and from
</p>
<p>the perusal of them I have gatheredthis, that if the three eminent
</p>
<p>gentlemen, to whom I have alluded have fallen from that moral dig-
</p>
<p>nity which in all other passages of their lives, as far as I have ever
</p>
<p>seen, they have honourably upheld, they have but followed the
</p>
<p>example of a greater man than any of them. Gentlemen, 1 say this
</p>
<p>without disparagement to them or to any member of my Profession
</p>
<p>at present in existence. They have but followed in the footsteps of the
</p>
<p>great Lord Coke himself, whose eminent virtues and high dignity as
</p>
<p>a lawyer were not proof ag-ainst the personal feelings which have ever
</p>
<p>governed the conduct of state lawyers in a state prosecution. Even the
</p>
<p>name of the illustrious Lord Coke has come down to posterity with
</p>
<p>" a dishonouring blot," incurred in a state prosecution, for no friend
</p>
<p>of humanity can read, without feelings of execration, disgust, and
</p>
<p>indignation, his attack upon Sir Walter Raleigh. If those who con-
</p>
<p>duct the present prosecution have fallen, therefore, from their high
</p>
<p>estate, it is not they alone who have so fallen. Gentlemen, I have

</p>
<p>told you that, in my opinion, this prosecution has been carried on un-
</p>
<p>fairly. Yes, I use the word advisedly  carried on unfairly by the
</p>
<p>three gentlemen who are at the head of these proceedings, and by
</p>
<p>their assistants; indeed, of their assistants, by-the-by, I shall not
</p>
<p>have much to say. Yes, Gentlemen, carried on unfairly; and I will
</p>
<p>redeem my pledge by showing you how applicable is the term. But,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, before I proceed further in my address, it is but right
</p>
<p>that I should call upon you to consider the position in which I stand,
</p>
<p>and the character which I assume, when, in the discharge of my pro-
</p>
<p>fessional duty, I proceed to animadvert on the conduct of the prose-
</p>
<p>cutors of my client. It is essentially necessary, and nothing more
</p>
<p>than mere justice to me, that you should bear in mind the exact po-
</p>
<p>sition which I occupy upon the present occasion. What is the na-
</p>
<p>ture and character of the important office whose duties I have taken
</p>
<p>upon me to discharge? Am I not the representative of my client?
</p>
<p>376
</p>
<p>Am I not in duty bound to say on his behalf every thing that I think
</p>
<p>he would say, and ought to say, in defence of himself, if he were de-
</p>
<p>fending himself, and if he had my abilities, humble as they are ?
</p>
<p>Nay more, Gentlemen, am I not bound to say for him every thing
</p>
<p>that I would say for myself, were 1 not the advocate, but the man ac-
</p>
<p>cused ? Yes, that is clearly my duty, and I hope, Gentlemen, that
</p>
<p>you will regard what I shall say upon the present occasion not, in
</p>
<p>truth, as my language, but rather as the language of a man put upon
</p>
<p>his trial, and defending himself to the best of his ability against a
</p>
<p>charge of guilt, when he is himself conscious of innocence. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, the present prosecution is a contest, and a contest of a very in-
</p>
<p>teresting character, to the result of which the country looks with
</p>
<p>eager expectation. It is a contest in the very temple of Justice  it is a
</p>
<p>contest, in the result of which are involved the characters and liberties
</p>
<p>of your fellow-subjects  and it is a contest, therefore, that ought to be
</p>
<p>carried on fairly on both sides, but, above all, fairly on the part of
</p>
<p>the prosecutors. Gentlemen, I will freely concede to the gentlemen
</p>
<p>who conduct this prosecution the power and privilege of exercising
</p>
<p>upon it their ability and ingenuity to the utmost extent; but all I re-
</p>
<p>quire of them is, that they should exercise that ability and ingenuity
</p>
<p>fairly and legally. Strike as hard as you please, but strike fairly ;
</p>
<p>strike fairly, and if you knock me down, and so that I can never rise
</p>
<p>again, I will, with my dying breath, admit, that although conquered
</p>
<p>by superior power, I am fairly conquered ; but if you aim a blow be-
</p>
<p>low the belt, you outrage the laws of manly combat, and are not the
</p>
<p>fair antagonist who deserves any respect or quarter at my hands.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the Attorney-General opened this case by beginning
</p>
<p>with the law of it. He told you that you should take the law of the case
</p>
<p>from the Court, and in this I concur with him, fori hope I am the last man
</p>
<p>of my Profession who would ever suggest to a jury not to be directed by
</p>
<p>the Court on every matter of law which it is fair, and legal, and pro-
</p>
<p>per for the Court to direct them upon. The law you will take, there-
</p>
<p>fore, from the Court; but I deny that the Court has the slightest ju-
</p>
<p>risdiction to diiect you upon the question of the guilt or the innocence

</p>
<p>of the accused ; that is purely a question of fact which the Court has
</p>
<p>nothing at all to do with. No action that can be imagined, not the
</p>
<p>killing of a man  no, nor even the killing of the Sovereign  no ac-
</p>
<p>tion that can be conceived can be pronounced as a guilty act by any
</p>
<p>judge or judges, Court or Courts, in this country, according to the
</p>
<p>spirit of the British Constitution, nor by any power whatsoever, other
</p>
<p>than by a jury of twelve men upon their oaths. Hatfield fired a pis-
</p>
<p>tol at the King in the public theatre, and was taken in the fact ; but
</p>
<p>no judge had authority to declare that he was guilty without the in-
</p>
<p>tervention of twelve men to decide it. They alone had the jurisdiction
</p>
<p>and right to look into the mind, and to declare the intent with which the
</p>
<p>act was done. The intent is that which constitutes guilt, and no act
</p>
<p>constitutes an offence abstracted from the intent with which it is
</p>
<p>committed. That is a maxim as old as common sense  as old as com-
</p>
<p>mon justice. If the mind is not guilty, the man is not guilty. It is
</p>
<p>377
</p>
<p>you, and you alone, who have authority to look into the mind, and to
</p>
<p>ascertain and declare the motive; and it is therefore you, and you
</p>
<p>alone, who are to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused ;
</p>
<p>and it is impossible legally to suggest that the Court can direct you
</p>
<p>upon that point; the Court has no jurisdiction to do so. The opinion
</p>
<p>of the Court, no doubt, may be expressed, though it is rarely, and, in
</p>
<p>my opinion, never ought to be expressed to the jury, on the point of
</p>
<p>guilt or innocence in criminal cases ; but in respect to the guilt of an
</p>
<p>accused party it never, never ought to be given. Why does the law
</p>
<p>take from the Court the decision of the guilt or innocence, and why
</p>
<p>does the law place this jurisdiction in twelve men selected from com-
</p>
<p>mon society ? Because guilt or innocence is never to be treated by
</p>
<p>technicalities  never to be treated as a question of science. It is
</p>
<p>never, therefore, a mere question of law, which is a species of
</p>
<p>science ; it is a question of morality, a question of mind, of intention,
</p>
<p>and of feeling. Therefore, a jury is the proper medium through
</p>
<p>which, and the proper tribunal by which that question is to be de-
</p>
<p>cided ; they are ordinary men, familiar with common motives; and
</p>
<p>therefore it is that they are taken from among their fellow men,
</p>
<p>because they are not technically instructed in this or that pro-
</p>
<p>fession ; and the law has wisely determined that they are best
</p>
<p>calculated to scrutinize and pronounce upon the actions cf ordinary
</p>
<p>men like themselves. I say, therefore, that with the question of
</p>
<p>guilt or innocence the Court has nothing whatever to do ; no jurisdic-
</p>
<p>tion or right to meddle at all, or even to express an opinion, if it be
</p>
<p>unfavourable to the accused ; and I deny the propriety in a criminal
</p>
<p>case of its doing so at all, because when you are discharging the high
</p>
<p>duties imposed on men in your position, you are to look into the minds
</p>
<p>and hearts of your fellow-subjects, and you are called upon to do so
</p>
<p>under the solemn obligation of an oath, and upon the evidence only,
</p>
<p>and not upon the opinion of any man, or set of men, no matter what
</p>
<p>their station may be. When you are required to pronounce upon the
</p>
<p>guilt or innocence of an accused party, the opinion of the Judge goes
</p>
<p>into your box with more weight than that of any individual, liable to

</p>
<p>be wrong, ought to carry with it. The law says, that each and every
</p>
<p>one of you is a better judge of that all-important question  the guilt
</p>
<p>or innocence of the mind and motive, than any Judge in the land.
</p>
<p>Therefore, Gentlemen, the law placing that in your hands, and call-
</p>
<p>ing on you to give your verdict, upon your responsibility to your
</p>
<p>own consciences, it is for you carefully and jealously to examine
</p>
<p>the opinion of any man who expresses that opinion to you, and
</p>
<p>to be cautious that you don't entertain it for more than its intrinsic
</p>
<p>worth. This, Gentlemen, I submit to you, subject to the correc-
</p>
<p>tion of the Court. I submit that you are to be yourselves guided by
</p>
<p>your unbiassed common sense in coming to the conclusion of the guilt
</p>
<p>or innocence of my client, and that you are not subject to any sort of
</p>
<p>direction or authority of the Court on that point. Gentlemen, hav-
</p>
<p>ing told you that you should take the law from the Court, the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General then proceeded, subject, as he admitted, to the correction
</p>
<p>3c
</p>
<p>378
</p>
<p>of the Court, and he stated to you what he said was the law of con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. Gentlemen, I do not agree with him in his statement of the
</p>
<p>law. Perhaps it may be said to me, but I think that would be no
</p>
<p>answer, that my learned friend, Mr. Moore, yesterday admitted that
</p>
<p>the law as stated by the Attorney-General was the law. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore stood here as counsel for the Rev. Mr. Tierney, and his
</p>
<p>was a peculiar case. He never attended more than one of those meet-
</p>
<p>ings. Against him, therefore, there is scarcely a shadow of evidence
</p>
<p>in the case that he conspired with any party. It was, therefore, not
</p>
<p>necessary for Mr. Moore to apply his able mind to the investigation of
</p>
<p>the law of conspiracy, as laid down for you by the Attorney-General.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I cannot, on the part of Dr. Gray, make that peculiar
</p>
<p>case ; and I have, therefore, first to deal with this great question  is
</p>
<p>there a conspiracy at all in this case ? It, therefore, becomes neces-
</p>
<p>sary for me to take up this question of law, which is yet untouched
</p>
<p>before you, and to expose to you the monstrous absurdity  and I think
</p>
<p>I can do so as clearly as ever I demonstrated a proposition of Euclid 
</p>
<p>the monstrous absurdity that would follow from the law, as laid down
</p>
<p>by the Attorney-General. Gentlemen, you have heard a phrase fre-
</p>
<p>quently made use of during the progress of this case. You have heard
</p>
<p>of " overt acts ;" over and over again has it been rung in your ears ;
</p>
<p>and let me now suggest this question to each of you to ask himself 
</p>
<p>does he at this moment, does anyone of the twelve gentlemen I have
</p>
<p>the honour to address, entertain the remotest idea in his mind of what
</p>
<p>is the meaning of an overt act? Gentlemen, the words " overt act"
</p>
<p>occur in only two offences, according to the law of England. I do
</p>
<p>not think that any one of you ever heard of an overt act of murder, an
</p>
<p>overt act of perjury, an overt act of larceny or thieving. What, there-
</p>
<p>fore, is the meaning of an overt act ? You may have heard of an overt
</p>
<p>act of treason, or, as in this case, of an overt act of conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Why should the term apply in these two cases only ? Let me
</p>
<p>explain to you, as it has not been explained before, and it is essentially
</p>
<p>necessary that it should be explained. Treason is a crime distinguished
</p>
<p>from all others in this ; that you may be guilty of it without doing any

</p>
<p>one corporal act at all. It is, perhaps, the only crime that a human
</p>
<p>being can commit without doing anything except thinking. If you
</p>
<p>imagine the death of the Sovereign, whether male or female  that is,
</p>
<p>if you form in your own mind a determination to kill the Sovereign,
</p>
<p>the moment you form that determination, you are guilty of high
</p>
<p>treason, though you should never after do any act in pursuance of that
</p>
<p>determination. What is the meaning of an overt act in treason ? It
</p>
<p>is an act which evidences the intention formed in the mind of killing
</p>
<p>the Sovereign. It is not properly an overt act of treason, unless it
</p>
<p>cannot be otherwise accounted for, than by the supposition that the
</p>
<p>party who did it must have predetermined in his mind to kill the So-
</p>
<p>vereign, or to do the other act constituting the treason. Treason,
</p>
<p>therefore, is a secret crime which a man may commit, without dis-
</p>
<p>closing the fact, or doing anything in pursuance of the intention. The
</p>
<p>crime being an act of the mind only, some visible act from which the
</p>
<p>379
</p>
<p>commision of the crime can be inferred, must be done efore the crime
</p>
<p>can be proved. It is a crime that one man may commit wthout tell-
</p>
<p>ing any one else of the fact, because it is the crime of the person's
</p>
<p>own mind. An overt act may therefore be denned to be an open, vi-
</p>
<p>sible, palpable act ; an act that can be seen, or a speech that can be
</p>
<p>heard ; something palpable done that can be made the object of the
</p>
<p>senses, and from which the commission of the secret crime can be in-
</p>
<p>ferred. The crime of conspiracy is also a secret crime, committed by
</p>
<p>more than one person forming a guilty purpose ; but it is not merely a
</p>
<p>determination in a man's own mind, the mere forming of which, on
</p>
<p>account of the enormity of the crime, is made to constitute the guilt
</p>
<p>of treason. Conspiracy is unlike treason in this particular, that the
</p>
<p>latter is an exception to the passage, where Milton says, that an evil
</p>
<p>thought might pass through the mind of the purest angel, and without
</p>
<p>guilt. It does not become a crime until carried into action, and if not
</p>
<p>carried into action, it does not become a crime at all. Conspiracy is
</p>
<p>the secret commission of a crime by more than one. If two or more
</p>
<p>persons agree together, and conspire by villanous means to commit
</p>
<p>some crime against their neighbour, then the law says they are guilty
</p>
<p>of conspiracy, although they should not accomplish, or even attempt
</p>
<p>to accomplish, the guilty purpose. If they lie in wait for their victim,
</p>
<p>while he is unconscious of the danger, then the law says they are
</p>
<p>guilty, although he should escape, and that is common sense and com-
</p>
<p>mon justice. The parties may consult secretly, and then you have
</p>
<p>only to look to some open and visible act done in pursuance of that con-
</p>
<p>sultation, and from that act infer that they are guilty of a conspiracy.
</p>
<p>This visible act should be such as cannot be otherwise accounted for,
</p>
<p>than by supposing a guilty combination to do it, else it is not properly
</p>
<p>called an overt act of conspiracy  that is, an act proving that a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy must have been formed, or such an act could not have been
</p>
<p>done. That is what is properly called an overt act. When you are
</p>
<p>called on to draw a conclusion, and a conclusion of the highest guilt,
</p>
<p>from certain acts, and you can account for them in any other manner
</p>
<p>than by supposing a case of guilt, I ask in such a case is it unnatural

</p>
<p>or unfair to ask you to refer the actions to the innocent motive ? An
</p>
<p>overt act affords an argument of guilt, and must be an act which a
</p>
<p>reasonable man can account for on no other supposition than that of
</p>
<p>guilt. Now let u3 apply this to the present case. The Attorney-
</p>
<p>General has told you there must have been a conspiracy between the
</p>
<p>eight defendants, because they did certain acts that have been given
</p>
<p>in evidence. When the Attorney-General proceeded to state the case,
</p>
<p>and mentioned the overt acts to you, I most anxiously followed him all
</p>
<p>through that statement, and I expected he would, in some place or
</p>
<p>other, have called your attention to some speech or other act which
</p>
<p>could not have been spoken or done if it had not been previously con-
</p>
<p>cocted or concerted between the parties. Did the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>do such a thing? He did not. He did not produce a single speech
</p>
<p>in evidence, that must have been from its intrinsic matter concocted
</p>
<p>previously by the defendants, if they had not been engaged in a
</p>
<p>380
</p>
<p>criminal conspiracy, which could not possibly have been the emanation
</p>
<p>of a single mind  which must have been concocted and contrived
</p>
<p>elaborately and criminally by more than one. He could not point out
</p>
<p>such a speech, although he made a statement of eleven hours' dura-
</p>
<p>tion, during which time he read a great variety of speeches from
</p>
<p>newspapers; he could not refer you to any passage to prove that one
</p>
<p>sentence of those speeches was previously concocted ; he could not
</p>
<p>produce a single speech or sentence, in its own nature showing that
</p>
<p>it had been previously arranged by the defendants. Did the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General attempt to tell you that any of the speeches, judging from the
</p>
<p>nature of them, must have been previously concocted by the conspira-
</p>
<p>tors? If not, then these speeches afforded no proof of a conspiracy at all.
</p>
<p>Did the Attorney-General, in detailing the case to you, show you any one
</p>
<p>act that could not be done by one individual, unless he had been pre-
</p>
<p>viously engaged in a criminal conspiracy with some other individual?
</p>
<p>Did the evidence produced show the parties were engaged in a conspiracy?
</p>
<p>No such thing. The evidence afforded no such inference. How did the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General attempt to argue the case before you, that there was a
</p>
<p>conspiracy? I will tell you the plan by which he endeavoured to do so.
</p>
<p>He said that there were many meetings held, that they were illegal meet-
</p>
<p>ings, and that those meetings were called by the defendants, and that the
</p>
<p>defendants all concurred in calling those meetings, and that therefore
</p>
<p>they were guilty of a conspiracy. Those eight traversers did agree, for
</p>
<p>instance, to call a meeting at the Hill of Tata, and the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>says that was an illegal meeting, and because they all had agreed to
</p>
<p>call that meeting, therefore they are guilty of a conspiracy, because they
</p>
<p>concurred in doing that illegal act. If the meeting was illegal, and
</p>
<p>the parties agreed in calling that illegal meeting, then they were
</p>
<p>guilty of concurring in that illegal object, and the law calls that a
</p>
<p>conspiracy. Another portion of the Attorney- General's argument
</p>
<p>was this ; if two or more of the parties concurred in doing a legal
</p>
<p>act in an illegal manner, then they are also guilty of a conspiracy.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General admitted it was legal to meet and petition
</p>
<p>Parliament for a Repeal of the Union, and he said he admitted to the
</p>

</p>
<p>fullest extent that to be legal. It would be, he admitted, legal for the
</p>
<p>defendants to make that their object, but the Attorney General said
</p>
<p>they were pursuing that object by illegal means, by calling illegal
</p>
<p>meetings and publishing seditious speeches, and therefore they were
</p>
<p>all concurring in procuring a Repeal of the Union by illegal means.
</p>
<p>This is the law as laid down by the Attorney-General  that is the
</p>
<p>law I have to deal with. I own when I heard that law propounded
</p>
<p>in a court of justice and in a state prosecution, it startled me a good
</p>
<p>deal. However, the Attorney-General did not come here without
</p>
<p>some authorities, which no doubt he read from books that had been
</p>
<p>printed; and he came backed by them, I am ready to admit. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, Mr. O'Connell, whose countenance I am so desirous to have,
</p>
<p>and whose assistance to suggest to me or correct me I would value
</p>
<p>exceedingly, has just told me he is obliged to go away. I am sorry
</p>
<p>to lose his countenance and assistance, but I must endeavour to do my
</p>
<p>381
</p>
<p>duty without it. Gentlemen, the Attorney-General has read his law
</p>
<p>from a book  of course it becomes vitally necessary to examine the
</p>
<p>history of that law, and see how it has got into that book. Give me
</p>
<p>your attention. There is the indictment. You are told that this is
</p>
<p>an indictment at common law, and it becomes necessary to examine
</p>
<p>what the meaning of that is. It means that it is an indictment which,
</p>
<p>on a similar state of facts to the present, could have been sustained
</p>
<p>in the reign of Ed ward the Confessor  could have been sustained before
</p>
<p>the Conquest, in the time of Edward, a good old King, whose laws
</p>
<p>the people have been anxious to preserve from that period to the
</p>
<p>present. I tell you, Gentlemen of the Jury, that is the meaning
</p>
<p>of the statement that this is an indictment at common law ; and
</p>
<p>when you approach the consideration of the question of "guilty
</p>
<p>or not guilty," you ought to consider the circumstances and the
</p>
<p>time in which this alleged crime has been committed. This is an
</p>
<p>indictment framed against eight members of a political association
</p>
<p>formed to redress an alleged grievance, established to obtain a Re-
</p>
<p>peal of the Union. Gentlemen, will you not be surprised to hear,
</p>
<p>that, from the time of Edward the Confessor up to the year 1794,
</p>
<p>there never was in England an instance of the members of a political
</p>
<p>association  aye, from the association headed by Wat Tyler down to
</p>
<p>the year 1794, there was not an instance of an indictment for con-
</p>
<p>spiracy against the members of an association of this kind. Is not
</p>
<p>that an astounding fact ? Was conspiracy a crime unknown to the
</p>
<p>law in those days ? Gentlemen, the law of conspiracy, at an early
</p>
<p>period, became an object of great solicitude, and was even the subject
</p>
<p>of legislation, It was a crime too dangerous to the liberty of the sub-
</p>
<p>ject to be left undefined, and one so calculated to be taken hold of as
</p>
<p>a ministerial scourge, that at a very early period it became the subject
</p>
<p>of a statutable legislation. By an Act passed in the 21st Edward the
</p>
<p>First, the crime was carefully defined ; and the definition is stated
</p>
<p>from the Act in the 1st vol. of Hawkins' Pleas of the Crown, 444,
</p>
<p>which is considered good authority, with prefatory statements of the
</p>
<p>object of the Act, which I will read for you : " For the better under-

</p>
<p>" standing of the nature of a conspiracy, I shall consider, first, who
</p>
<p>" may be said to be guilty of conspiracy ; second, in what manner such
</p>
<p>" offenders are to be punished. As the first point  who may be said
</p>
<p>" to be guilty of conspiracy  there can be no better rule than the Sta-
</p>
<p>" tute, the 33rd, or rather the 21st of Edward the First, the intent of
</p>
<p>" which was to make a final definition of conspirators, to which pur-
</p>
<p>" pose it declareth : ' Conspirators be they that do confeder or bind
</p>
<p>" ' themselves by oath, covenant, or other alliance, that every of them
</p>
<p>" ' shall aid and bear the other falsely and maliciously to indict, or
</p>
<p>" ' cause to indict, or falsely to move and maintain pleas ; and also
</p>
<p>" ' such as cause children within age to appeal men of felony, whereby
</p>
<p>" ' they are imprisoned and sore grieved, and such as retain men in
</p>
<p>" ' the country with liveries or fees for to maintain their malicious
</p>
<p>" ' cnterprizes, and this extendeth as well to the takers as to the
</p>
<p>I ' givers, and to stewards and bailiffs of great lords, who, by their
</p>
<p>382
</p>
<p>" ' seignory, office, or power, undertake to bear or maintain quar-
</p>
<p>" * rels, pleas, or debates that concern other parties than such as
</p>
<p>" ' touch the estates of their lords or themselves.' " Thus you see
</p>
<p>that Hawkins states the intention of that Act of Parliament to have
</p>
<p>been to make a final definition of the crime of conspiracy. I won't
</p>
<p>do as the highest law officer of the Crown has done  1 won't keep
</p>
<p>from your view one part of a page, which is calculated to explain the
</p>
<p>part I read. I will not say whether this was right or wrong; but
</p>
<p>I will show you by-and-by that it has been done. I admit that
</p>
<p>in the same book, page 446, it is said, " that it seems more safe and
</p>
<p>" advisable to ground an indictment of this kind upon the common law
</p>
<p>" than upon the Statute, since there can be no doubt that all confedera-
</p>
<p>" cies whatsoever wrongfully to prejudice a third person are highly
</p>
<p>" criminal at common law, as where divers persons confederate
</p>
<p>" together by indirect means to impoverish a third person, or falsely
</p>
<p>" and maliciously to charge a man with being the reputed father
</p>
<p>" of a bastard child, or to maintain one another in any matter,
</p>
<p>" whether it be true or false." The instances here given by
</p>
<p>Hawkins of the crime of conspiracy at common law, arose from
</p>
<p>cases in which it would have been unreasonable to allow the criminal
</p>
<p>conduct involved in them to go unpunished, and not being within the
</p>
<p>terms of the Statute of Edward 1. it was concluded that they must
</p>
<p>be punishable at common law. One of the earliest of these cases of
</p>
<p>a prosecution for a conspiracy at common law was The King v.
</p>
<p>Edwards. The history of the case is this : the parishes in England
</p>
<p>were each bound to sustain their own paupers, and as a body of per-
</p>
<p>sons in power sometimes assume the character of an individual, and
</p>
<p>commit frauds similar to those committed by individuals, the parish
</p>
<p>officers in England used by fraud to transfer the paupers from their
</p>
<p>own to an adjoining parish. In The King against Edwards, the
</p>
<p>officers of one parish had agreed to give a sum of money to a man in
</p>
<p>an adjoining parish to marry a cripple  not for matrimonial purposes,
</p>
<p>but for the purpose of transferring the burthen from their own
</p>
<p>parish to the adjoining one ; they conspired to bribe him, and were

</p>
<p>very properly indicted for the conspiracy. That was one of the first
</p>
<p>instances reported of a prosecution for a conspiracy at common law.
</p>
<p>Another occurred also at an early period. A cardmaker had become
</p>
<p>famous for his manufacture, and another cardmaker, with his wife
</p>
<p>and servants, conspired together to bribe the apprentice of his rival
</p>
<p>to put grease into the glue used in making the cards, whereby the
</p>
<p>cards might be spoiled, and the maker might lose his reputation.
</p>
<p>They were indicted, and properly, and that case affords an illustration
</p>
<p>of what an overt act of conspiracy is. In that case it could not be
</p>
<p>proved by direct evidence that they had conspired. There was no
</p>
<p>one present but themselves when they conspired; but it was proved
</p>
<p>that the father, upon one day, gave money to the apprentice, the wife
</p>
<p>upon another, and upon another day that the servant gave it, and each
</p>
<p>gave the money for the same purpose of inducing him to mix grease
</p>
<p>with the paste; and the Court allowed their several and respective acts
</p>
<p>383
</p>
<p>to go to the jury, as evidence of the conspiracy, on the ground that being
</p>
<p>members of the same family, living in the same house, and all adopt-
</p>
<p>ing the same scheme to accomplish one and the same criminal object
</p>
<p>of ruining the man by the same abominable means. The coincidence
</p>
<p>of their acts was considered as evidence of concerted co-operation,
</p>
<p>and what was done by each in the absence of the others was there-
</p>
<p>fore allowed to go to the jury as evidence of the conspiracy. That
</p>
<p>case is reported in Strange, and is a plain illustration of the doctrine
</p>
<p>of conspiracy, and is at once sanctioned by law and by common sense.
</p>
<p>Let me now give you the history of the Attorney-General's defini-
</p>
<p>tion of conspiracy. First let me give you the definition itself; 1 have
</p>
<p>it in his own words, I took them from his own lips, and I think I will
</p>
<p>be borne out by every one who took down his words as well as I did
</p>
<p>myself. He told you a conspiracy is a crime which consists either
</p>
<p>in a combination or agreement to do some illegal act, or to effect a
</p>
<p>legal purpose by illegal means. That is his definition. In support
</p>
<p>of that definition the Attorney-General cited two cases; one of
</p>
<p>them was The King v. Jones, 4 Barn. & Ad. 349, 350. I pray your
</p>
<p>attention to that case. It was an indictment against several indi-
</p>
<p>viduals for conspiring together to conceal the effects of a bankrupt,
</p>
<p>a very heinous offence according to the bankruptcy laws. In that
</p>
<p>case there was a conviction, and there was a motion to arrest the judg-
</p>
<p>ment, and Lord Denman spoke these words in giving judgment against
</p>
<p>the indictment : " The indictment ought to charge conspiracy either
</p>
<p>to do an unlawful act, or a lawful act by unlawful means." This is the
</p>
<p>authority cited. No doubt Lord Denman is a very able and a very consti-
</p>
<p>tutional judge, and perhaps those were the words he used on that oc-
</p>
<p>casion. But saying that the indictment on which he was giving judg-
</p>
<p>ment was bad, because it did not charge the doing of an illegal act,
</p>
<p>or of a legal act by illegal means, was not deciding that an indictment
</p>
<p>would be good which charged this and nothing more. His so saying
</p>
<p>was not at all necessary in order to decide on the indictment before
</p>
<p>him ; and now let me tell you the value that is to be attached to the
</p>
<p>saying of a judge under such circumstances. Mind, that such a say-

</p>
<p>ing is not a decision of the judge who says it, nor is it the decision
</p>
<p>of the Court of which he is a member  it is what we call techni-
</p>
<p>cally, a dictum  to use a common expression, an ipse dixit. No
</p>
<p>constitutional judge will ever pay much attention to one of these
</p>
<p>dicta : and I believe the true value of them was never more truly
</p>
<p>described than by Sir Anthony Hart, who, when somebody was
</p>
<p>pressing him with the dictum of a judge, said " he always thought
</p>
<p>" that the quotation of a dictum was an attempt to mislead one
</p>
<p>"judge, by misrepresenting another." And I remember more than
</p>
<p>once to have heard a judge of equal ability, the present Baron Pen-
</p>
<p>nefather, repress the habit of citing in one case what a judge has
</p>
<p>said, in the way of observation, on another, and for this reason, this
</p>
<p>plain reason, that what is said by a judge in a particular case, is said
</p>
<p>in reference exclusively to the facts of that case, and is not said by
</p>
<p>any means as laying down a general law to affect cases that may be
</p>
<p>composed of very different facts. It was in 1832 that Lord Denman
</p>
<p>384
</p>
<p>used the words cited by the Attorney General, and which I have al-
</p>
<p>ready repeated to you; and in 1834 the same judge (and I wonder
</p>
<p>the Attorney General did not make use of the fact) in the case
</p>
<p>of Rex v. Seymour, 1 Ad. & Ell., 713, which was an indict-
</p>
<p>ment for conspiracy by criminal means to exonerate one parish
</p>
<p>from a pauper, and to throw him upon another, again spoke the
</p>
<p>same dictum, and, as in the case of Rex\. Jones, he used it in grant-
</p>
<p>ing the motion for an arrest of judgment. It so happened in 1839, that
</p>
<p>another case came before the same Chief Justice ; it was a case in
</p>
<p>which a set of cheats had been indicted for opening a shop, and
</p>
<p>practising concerted schemes to defraud people of their goods. The
</p>
<p>jury convicted them, and there was a motion to arrest judgment,
</p>
<p>because the charge made in the indictment was not properly within
</p>
<p>the law of conspiracy. Lord Denman's dictum was cited to him by
</p>
<p>counsel to uphold that indictment, and his Lordship's observation
</p>
<p>upon it was this : " 1 do not think the antithesis is very correct." This
</p>
<p>was his commentary on his own dictum ; and he disregarded his own
</p>
<p>dictum, and the judgment was arrested; and however great his au-
</p>
<p>thority in other respects, there is not much of its weight embodied
</p>
<p>in that dictum. That is the case of The King v. , 9 Ad. & El. 690.
</p>
<p>Oh! but the Attorney-General does not rest upon the authority of
</p>
<p>Lord Denman's dictum alone, there is also the dictum of an equally
</p>
<p>able judge, the late Lord Chief Justice Bushe, in the case of The
</p>
<p>King v. Forbes ; he stated, in charging the jury, "the nature of a
</p>
<p>conspiracy is now to be described." Remember, Gentlemen, there
</p>
<p>is a very substantial difference between a description and definition.
</p>
<p>But the learned Judge went on : " It is defined to be where two or more
</p>
<p>" persons confederate together for the effecting of an illegal purpose, or
</p>
<p>" or to effect a legal purpose by the use of unlawful means, even al-
</p>
<p>" though such purpose should never have been effected." That is his
</p>
<p>description, or if you like to call it so, his definition of the crime of
</p>
<p>conspiracy. I was anxious to trace this definition, as it is called, to its
</p>
<p>source, and to find where, and when, and how it had its origin, because,
</p>
<p>let me tell you, that in legal argument sometimes, and in books of

</p>
<p>law, particularly text books, a course is very commonly pursued
</p>
<p>analogous to that which map-makers pursue in copying from those
</p>
<p>who went before. The definition of Chief Jutice Bushe was taken
</p>
<p>from East's Pleas of the Crown, 462, almost verbatim.; and now
</p>
<p>let me tell you from whence East got it. East gives it in commenting
</p>
<p>on the case of The King v. Edwards. In that case, reported in 8
</p>
<p>Mod. a motion was made to quash the indictment because it did not
</p>
<p>show, on the face of it, any offence. The Court answered by saying,
</p>
<p>that quashing an indictment was a matter of discretion, and that they
</p>
<p>would not do it in that case ; and it is reported that the Court said
</p>
<p>on that occasion, when it was not necessary to decide any such thing,
</p>
<p>that conspiring to do an unlawful act, or a lawful act by unlawful
</p>
<p>means, is a crime ; and you may now see where Lord Denman got
</p>
<p>his antithesis. That is reported in 8 Mod. 320, a book, too, of
</p>
<p>rather questionable authority. But it is no matter whether the
</p>
<p>385
</p>
<p>report is correct or not, it is nothing but a mere dictum of the Court,
</p>
<p>describing the common law offence. Such a definition is not to be
</p>
<p>found in Coke, or in any of the old authorities, who were better
</p>
<p>acquainted with the common law than we are. No doubt it is to be
</p>
<p>found in East's book ; be is a man of the present day, I may say, a
</p>
<p>writer of no coercive authority to lay down the law. A text writer :
</p>
<p>no doubt a very useful one ; no doubt, in the main, a very correct
</p>
<p>one; but no binding authority. Besides, his definition is merely a
</p>
<p>repetition of the dictum in the case of The King v. Edwards. Such
</p>
<p>is the Attorney-General's first proposition on this law of conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Now let us come to his second proposition, which is this: he savs:
</p>
<p>" If you believe that the several traversers have been engaged in the
</p>
<p><s common design of obtaining the object in view ; that moment, if
</p>
<p>" they have the common design, the moment that they have
</p>
<p>" the common design, that moment they are guilty of the crime
</p>
<p>" of conspiracy, and the act of one is evidence against the others."
</p>
<p>Let us deal with this proposition. What is the common design ? To
</p>
<p>obtain a Repeal of the Union. That is the common design. Can it
</p>
<p>be denied that they have been engaged in that ? Can it be denied
</p>
<p>that one million at least of our countrymen have been engaged in
</p>
<p>that ? It cannot. This million, therefore, are conspirators ; that is,
</p>
<p>the worst and the most criminal of the human race ; and the act of
</p>
<p>every one is to be evidence against all, and against every one of
</p>
<p>them. Gentlemen, give your attention for a moment to the mons-
</p>
<p>trous consequences involved in this proposition. First, you are called
</p>
<p>upon to believe that every human being who attended every one of
</p>
<p>those multitudinous meetings, being thus engaged in the common de-
</p>
<p>sign of obtaining the Repeal of the Union, is guilty of being a conspira-
</p>
<p>tor ; and the act of every man of these is evidence against every other
</p>
<p>of them. You can, if you believe that to be the law, account for the
</p>
<p>admission in evidence of the conversation between Captain Despard
</p>
<p>and a man that he says he met on the back of a ditch, in the outskirt
</p>
<p>of the meeting, where there was not one of the defendants to hear
</p>
<p>what passed between them  a conversation with a man, whose name,

</p>
<p>place of abode, whose very description is unknown. That conversa-
</p>
<p>tion was carried on between Captain Despard and him  that conver-
</p>
<p>sation has been given in evidence against those eight defendants, and
</p>
<p>on what principle? Upon the principle, that those eight defendants
</p>
<p>had constituted that man, whom they had never seen, no matter who
</p>
<p>he was, to be the agent of each and every of them, and had given
</p>
<p>him authority to speak for them, and bound themselves to stand or fall
</p>
<p>by his language, whatever it might be, in their absence. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>you have here  believe me you have here, a heavy and serious duty
</p>
<p>imposed upon you, and the liberty and safety of your fellow-subjects are
</p>
<p>in your hands, when you, twelve men of common sense  twelve honest
</p>
<p>men are called upon to give the sanction of your verdict to a doctrine
</p>
<p>so absurd. The speech of this man, whoever he was, from the back
</p>
<p>of the ditch, is here put in evidence as an overt act of conspiracy in
</p>
<p>the defendants, that is to say, an act which affords convincing proof
</p>
<p>to the mind that that act could not have been done by that man un-
</p>
<p>3d
</p>
<p>386
</p>
<p>less there had been a previous criminal concert and agreement be-
</p>
<p>tween him and the eight defendants. The only ground on which
</p>
<p>the act of that man. whoever he was, can, with any colour of justice,-
</p>
<p>be admitted as evidence against the traversers, is the assumption that
</p>
<p>they had made him their agent, and the only way in which this evi-
</p>
<p>dence, when admitted, can advance the prosecution, is by considering
</p>
<p>it as a proof that the meeting was seditious, because this man's words
</p>
<p>were seditious; that is the only way it can be entertained by you in
</p>
<p>this case as evidence in any degree whatever to affect your verdict.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you are not here trying whether any of those meetings
</p>
<p>were illegal or not ; you are not here trying whether any opinion
</p>
<p>expressed at them was legally or morally wrong or not ; you are not
</p>
<p>trying whether any speech made at them was seditious or not.
</p>
<p>Those meetings are admissible in evidence for one or other of these
</p>
<p>purposes, and for one of these purposes only. First, they are ad-
</p>
<p>missible in evidence (and it is in this way only that the legality or
</p>
<p>illegality of them comes incidentally into question) for the purpose
</p>
<p>of showing that the Repeal of the Union was pursued by the defen-
</p>
<p>dants by illegal means, and therefore, and therefore only, does the
</p>
<p>question of the legality or illegality of any of those meetings arise in
</p>
<p>this case. Secondly, whether they were legal or not, the meetings
</p>
<p>may be evidence in this case as overt acts, that is, they may be evi-
</p>
<p>dence showing that they could not have taken place unless there had
</p>
<p>been a previous conspiracy, and a previous conspiracy of these defen-
</p>
<p>dants ; this is the only way in which your attention can legitimately
</p>
<p>be given to any of those meetings at all.
</p>
<p>Now let me deal with this conversation between Captain Despard
</p>
<p>and this man on the ditch. If that conversation could be taken as evi-
</p>
<p>dence, that, in fact, 2000 men, 2000 able bodied men, bone-and-sinew
</p>
<p>men, as that fellow expressed it, had marched from the county of Wex-
</p>
<p>ford to the county ofMeath, to aid at the exhibition of physical force
</p>
<p>intended to be made at that meeting  if such were the intent, if
</p>
<p>such a conversation could, I say, be taken as evidence of that, and
</p>
<p>if you from that conversation believe that that was the fact, then.

</p>
<p>Gentlemen, that conversation may be worthy of your attention.
</p>
<p>But do you believe, first, that 2000 able bodied men did march
</p>
<p>from the county of Wexford from the barony of Shilmalier ? Do
</p>
<p>you believe that? Gentlemen, is that a fact which, if it happen-
</p>
<p>ed, is susceptible of any proof ? Are you, in the absence of that proof,
</p>
<p>to presume the fact, which, if it were a fact, could so easily be proved ?
</p>
<p>Did these men go in a balloon, and if they did, did they soar to such
</p>
<p>a height that they could not be seen from the earth ? Did they pass
</p>
<p>under ground ? What road did they go  what roads did they go ?
</p>
<p>Where is the human being that saw any of them in their transit ?
</p>
<p>Where are the witnesses to prove that any of the peasant dresses of
</p>
<p>the county of Wexford, as peculiar as any in Ireland, were to be seen
</p>
<p>at Tara meeting? I take it for granted, Gentlemen, that some of
</p>
<p>you have been in the county of Wexford, and saw the peasant's hat in
</p>
<p>Wexford  the straw hat ; and I suppose you observed the striking
</p>
<p>peculiarity of appearan- of all the Wexford peasantry; where is the
</p>
<p>387
</p>
<p>man of all the police who attended at Tara, to tell yon lie saw one
</p>
<p>Wexford man at it ? Captain Despard did not ; who did? Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, persons in my Profession perhaps, witnessing as they do, a little
</p>
<p>more frequently than the most experienced juror can do, the frailties
</p>
<p>of human nature so often exhibited by witnesses on the table, espe-
</p>
<p>cially in cases where they are deeply interested, may give me, perhaps,
</p>
<p>too severe a view of witnesses. Captain Despard is a very handsome
</p>
<p>looking fellow, he has fine whiskers, and is a flippant, clever, very
</p>
<p>ready witness. He went without whip or spur, and he came here to
</p>
<p>tell us, I think, not a very probable story. Suppose for a moment,
</p>
<p>that there were 2000 men there from Wexford, and that this person
</p>
<p>who spoke to him on the ditch was one of them (I think that is insi-
</p>
<p>nuated), mind all the coats about him were those of Meath and Kil-
</p>
<p>dare ; the conversation was not in a whisper, it was loud, every person
</p>
<p>round him must have heard it. I own, Gentlemen, that even if I were
</p>
<p>known, as I hope I am, to a jury of my fellow-citizens, and if I had to
</p>
<p>appear as a witness to prove that conversation, I confess 1 would be
</p>
<p>very anxious indeed to have it corroborated; there is so much native
</p>
<p>improbability in the thing, that I should not desire to sustain the
</p>
<p>whole burthen of proving it if I could divide it with another. This
</p>
<p>Wexford man, I am sure, knew Captain Despard  nay, he made him-
</p>
<p>self known to him. He must indeed be ripe for rebellion, when he was
</p>
<p>thus ready publicly to avow his sentiments. And he must have been sin-
</p>
<p>gularly destitute of common caution, when he could thus voluntarily
</p>
<p>state to the head of the police, that he had come with a body of
</p>
<p>" bone-and-sinew" men to that meeting ; above all, that he should
</p>
<p>be guilty of the folly of stating that Mr. O'Connell did not want such
</p>
<p>men as Captain Despard, but u bone-and-sinew" men ; a plain insi-
</p>
<p>nuation that he wanted men to fight, not men to petition; this is the
</p>
<p>very acme of improbability. Do you think that to prepare for bat-
</p>
<p>tle was the real object of those meetings ? And if a man of this de-
</p>
<p>scription knew that it was, and partook in that guilt, do you think it a
</p>
<p>very likely thing that he would thus become transparent, and turn
</p>
<p>himself, as it were, inside out, in the presence of a number of wit-

</p>
<p>nesses, and in a public place? Why, he must expect the next in-
</p>
<p>stant to be seized and thrust into gaol. Is this story so very proba-
</p>
<p>ble, as thatCaptain Despard, with all his flippancy of tone and manner,
</p>
<p>should expect a Jury on their oaths, to swallow it without corrobora-
</p>
<p>tion, when it might have been so easily corroborated? He told you
</p>
<p>that this man stood upon his left hand, and that immediately upon
</p>
<p>his right was his own policeman, Walker, who heard what had passed.
</p>
<p>This Walker was examined, and he was allowed to go from the ta-
</p>
<p>ble without being asked a single question as to whether he had heard
</p>
<p>this extraordinary conversation. The Superintendent of Police, Ma-
</p>
<p>jor Westenra, was also standing by, and in actual contact with Cap-
</p>
<p>tain Despard, and he has not been produced. Major Westenra, alive
</p>
<p>and well, living in Ireland, and in the public service, and therefore
</p>
<p>amenable and ready to obey those acting for the Crown  this gentle-
</p>
<p>man, who must have overheard such a conversation, if it took place,
</p>
<p>is not produced. But it would perhaps be going too far to ask you
</p>
<p>388
</p>
<p>to believe that Captain Despard was an inventor of the story. I can
</p>
<p>well believe the difficulty which twelve gentlemen would have in
</p>
<p>coming to such a conclusion ; still it remains to bo accounted for why
</p>
<p>Walker was not questioned upon the subject, or why Major Westenra
</p>
<p>was not produced. Here, Gentlemen, you are in a sort of " fix."
</p>
<p>Let us see how you can be got out of it. Walker, Major Westenra, and
</p>
<p>this pretended Wexford man, were all on the ditch. Captain Des-
</p>
<p>pard comes up, and of course knows nothing of any arrangement
</p>
<p>previously made by the others. He sees his friend Major Westenra,
</p>
<p>and lie goes up and stands near him. Now, if Major Westenra and
</p>
<p>Walker had so planned the thing as soon as their friend Despard
</p>
<p>should come up, that this man, planted there for the purpose, should
</p>
<p>address him in that extraordinary way, I can then understand why
</p>
<p>Captain Despard comes alone to prove the conversation, and why
</p>
<p>Walker was not questioned, and Major Westenra not produced.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I will show you in this case, a little management in
</p>
<p>another matter, that would render it not improbable that something of
</p>
<p>the kind may have been done in this particular instance. You may
</p>
<p>remember the Crown wished to bring home to the traversers the
</p>
<p>devising the heads and ornaments for some of the cards. In the
</p>
<p>year 1844, the days of Paddy M'Kews are, to a certain extent, gone
</p>
<p>by, and we shall see matters of this kind in our days conducted in a
</p>
<p>more civilized way. It will not exactly do now-a-days to bring upon
</p>
<p>the table a man who has joined an Association of this kind, who perhaps
</p>
<p>was the suggester, the contriver, the inventor, and the executor of
</p>
<p>those features of it which are or are supposed to bear most hardly
</p>
<p>against the members of the society  it will not do now-a-days to bring
</p>
<p>a man who has violated every principle of truth and honour towards
</p>
<p>his associates, before a jury, and expect they will believe him. That
</p>
<p>is not to be expected now, and if the master lithograph printer, Hol-
</p>
<p>brooke, appeared as a witness, and if it should appear that he had
</p>
<p>been a leading, conspicuous, noisy, and clamorous member of the
</p>
<p>Association, it could hardly be expected, if he should come here as
</p>
<p>a crown witness, that you would believe him. Holbrooke is not

</p>
<p>produced, but two young men, whom he happened to have in his
</p>
<p>employment, are produced, to prove the engraving of the card; and
</p>
<p>you remember the difficulty there was in establishing, by the -testi-
</p>
<p>mony of these men, the connexion of those cards with the Associ-
</p>
<p>ation. What could have been easier than to prove that connexion
</p>
<p>in the way it had been done in the case of the placards, to prove
</p>
<p>which, Mr. Browne, who was employed to print them, and paid by
</p>
<p>the Secretary, was produced. I am sure I am addressing rational
</p>
<p>men  that I am addressing honest men  men of the world and of
</p>
<p>experience  who will give its proper effect to every fact brought out
</p>
<p>on this prosecution, and I ask you, is not the reason obvious why
</p>
<p>Holbrooke, who was the workman of the Association, and also, at
</p>
<p>the same time, the workman of the Government, was not produced
</p>
<p>to prove the connexion between his work and the Association, who
</p>
<p>had employed him to do it. But if Holbrooke was convicted on
</p>
<p>this table of having been the instrument of the Government  if it
</p>
<p>389
</p>
<p>should appear that he had himself suggested those emhlems of se-
</p>
<p>dition which he executed  that he had put them upon the cards of
</p>
<p>this Association,  such adisclosure would bring odium upon this whole
</p>
<p>proceeding, and could not fail to call aloud for your condemnation.
</p>
<p>Therefore Holbrooke has been permitted to roam at large, to wear
</p>
<p>his cap of liberty. And I ask is not the fact that Holbrooke is kept
</p>
<p>back, and that bis journeymen, who could scarcely prove anything,
</p>
<p>are produced, of itself strong evidence of crafty and subtle contri-
</p>
<p>vance in the management of the case in one particular; and is it too
</p>
<p>much for me to ask you to believe that there may be some contri-
</p>
<p>vance and management also in another particular, whether or not I
</p>
<p>have exactly conjectured the details of that arrangement by which
</p>
<p>this Wexford man, so called, was brought into communication with
</p>
<p>Captain Despard, it is not important to determine. This transition
</p>
<p>naturally arises out of my observations on the Attorney-General's
</p>
<p>second proposition of law. I was calling your attention to the mon-
</p>
<p>strous injustice which follows from this alleged proposition of law,
</p>
<p>that of admitting as evidence of criminality against my client this
</p>
<p>conversation held at the back of a a ditch between total strangers to
</p>
<p>the parties on trial, and no part of which was ever heard by any of
</p>
<p>them. The Attorney-General, however, stated this proposition not
</p>
<p>merely as his own, but he came with authority to support it. Indeed
</p>
<p>it required some authority to sustain it, for its application in this
</p>
<p>case exhibits a novel degree of injustice, if not of absurdity ; and ac-
</p>
<p>cordingly Mr. Attorney does not take the responsibility of asserting
</p>
<p>this law upon himself, but he turns it over on Mr. Justice Coleridge,
</p>
<p>and he cites him as the'authority for it. He says, in effect, to you :
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I give it to you as I find it. I have only used a pair of
</p>
<p>scissors to cut it out of the book, and then I have put it into my
</p>
<p>statement, to form part of the patchwork on which I mean to rest
</p>
<p>this case. In citing Mr. Justice Coleridge, the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>followed the course which Sir Anthony Hart said is generally fol-
</p>
<p>lowed in the quotation of dictums ; for I think the Attorney-Gene-
</p>
<p>ral somewhat misrepresents, or perhaps he misunderstood the learned

</p>
<p>judge on whose authority he relies. The Attorney-General cited from
</p>
<p>the case of The King \. Murphy, 8 Carr. k Payne, 310, where Mr.
</p>
<p>Justice Coleridge told the jury : " If you are of opinion that the acts
</p>
<p>" of those two persons were done without a common concert or de-
</p>
<p>11 sign between them, the present charge cannot be supported. It is
</p>
<p>" not necessary to prove that those two parties came together, or
</p>
<p>" agreed in terms to have the common design, because in many cases
</p>
<p>" of clearly established conspiracy there may be no means of proving
</p>
<p>" any such thing, and neither law nor common sense requires it
</p>
<p>" should be proved. If you believe the two persons pursued by their
</p>
<p>" acts the same object, often by the same means, one performing one
</p>
<p>" part of an act, and the other another part of the same act, with
</p>
<p>" a view to the attainment of the same object they were pursuing,
</p>
<p>" you will be at liberty to draw the conclusion that they had been
</p>
<p>" engaged in a conspiracy to effect that object." Now, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>while I profess my utter inability to regard the proposition pro-
</p>
<p>390
</p>
<p>pounded by the Attorney-General in any other light than as an ille-
</p>
<p>gal and monstrous absurdity, I entirely concur in the language of
</p>
<p>Justice Coleridge that I have read to you, taking it, of course, in con-
</p>
<p>junction with the facts to which it was applied, and having regard to
</p>
<p>the case in which it was spoken, and to the evidence which was offered
</p>
<p>in that case. His words, when the whole are taken together, appear
</p>
<p>perfectly consistent with good law and common sense, and all they
</p>
<p>amount to is this, that men who have conspired (and I now use the
</p>
<p>word in its criminal sense, for I will bring you by-and-by to the dif-
</p>
<p>ference between conspiracy and concert) however they may conceal
</p>
<p>the fact itself of conspiring, may, in pursuing the object of their con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, act so as to give sufficient and satisfactory proof that they
</p>
<p>must have conspired. That men who have agreed to do criminal
</p>
<p>acts, may so execute these acts as to demonstrate that the conspiracy
</p>
<p>existed between them previous to the doing of these criminal acts.
</p>
<p>For instance, not only pursuing the same object by the same means,
</p>
<p>but doing so in such a way as to demonstrate previous concert as
</p>
<p>*' one doing one part of an act, and the other doing another part of the
</p>
<p>" same act"  i.e., one beginning and the other finishing the same act,
</p>
<p>in such a way that you cannot account for the identity of their actions
</p>
<p>in any other way than by assuming a preconcerted arrangement be-
</p>
<p>tween them. This is the substance of the passage from the charge of
</p>
<p>Justice Coleridge. And it is as plain as day that Mr. Justice Cole-
</p>
<p>ridge, when he used the language referred to, spoke it, in reference
</p>
<p>to the case and the facts then before the jury, and to the proofs given
</p>
<p>in that particular case. He was speaking of two individuals who were
</p>
<p>connected, and whose acts were connected by a variety of circum-
</p>
<p>stances, all tending to show that they were acting by a previous con-

<p>cert and conspiracy. And are we to have the language applied to
</p>
<p>that case, as it were thrown into a crucible, and refined so as to make
</p>
<p>it applicable to this State prosecution? Because Mr. Justice Cole-
</p>
<p>ridge told a jury that they might infer a conspiracy between two men,
</p>
<p>from the fact, that these two men were pursuing the particular object
</p>
<p>in that particular case often by the same means, and from the fact that

</p>
<p>in so doing, one sometimes began and the other finished one and the
</p>
<p>same act, and from other similar facts (for he mentioned these but as
</p>
<p>instances), therefore, one sweeping general proposition is to be con-
</p>
<p>cocted, and the authority of Mr. Justice Coleridge is to be quoted for
</p>
<p>it: " that wherever one common object is in fact pursued," there you
</p>
<p>are at liberty to infer that a conspiracy exists amongst those who are
</p>
<p>in pursuit of that object  that because a million of people or three mil-
</p>
<p>lions of people are associated together for a political object  the repeal
</p>
<p>of an Act which they consider to bean injurious law  thatbecausethey
</p>
<p>happen to entertain one political sentiment, and concur in one common
</p>
<p>political intent  the acts of every one of that million, no matter where
</p>
<p>their acts are done, how they are done, when done, or almost whether
</p>
<p>done at all or not, yetthese acts are all to be given in evidence against
</p>
<p>any one man, or any number of men selected from these millions, and
</p>
<p>because of the concurrence of their political sentiments, and the
</p>
<p>consequent unity of their political object, they are to be at once
</p>
<p>391
</p>
<p>pronounced to be criminal conpirators. And this is the proposition
</p>
<p>which you, twelve men of common sense, are called upon on
</p>
<p>your oaths to take as the law of the land. But the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General is wonderfully expert at citing cases, indeed I will do him
</p>
<p>the justice to say, that in this respect, he has scarcely a rival in the
</p>
<p>Hall. There is no case in the books he will not make out for you in
</p>
<p>less than five minutes, and accordingly he did not come into Court
</p>
<p>resting alone on the authority of Mr. Justice Coleridge. He had
</p>
<p>another arrow in his quiver. He told you that Mr. Justice Bailey,
</p>
<p>a great lawyer, I will admit, was also in favour of his general pro-
</p>
<p>position, and he referred you triumphantly to some words at-
</p>
<p>tributed to that learned judge, in the case of The King v. Watson,
</p>
<p>32 St. Tr. 7. But first, let me tell you that The King v. Watson
</p>
<p>was a prosecution for high treason, and, therefore, not by any
</p>
<p>means strictly analogous to the present prosecution. The Attorney-
</p>
<p>General read you a very brief extract from the language of Judge
</p>
<p>Bailey upon that occasion; but he omitted much of what that learned
</p>
<p>judge said, that qualified and explained the part cited by the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General. I ask you to hear now the language of the Judge himself, and
</p>
<p>do not content yourselves with a mere isolated" passage from it. Mr.
</p>
<p>Justice Bailey was speaking of a conspiracy in a case of high treason.
</p>
<p>What was the nature and the character of the conspiracy in question ?
</p>
<p>Was he speaking of an accidental agreement and concurrence of
</p>
<p>opinion amongst a large section of the subjects of the Crown, which
</p>
<p>they individually believed they had a perfect right to entertain and
</p>
<p>to express ? Is the existence of such an accidental coincidence, as
</p>
<p>very possibly may exist upon the subject of Repeal of the Union,
</p>
<p>whether for or against it, between me and any gentlemen in that
</p>
<p>box, the least evidence of conspiracy between us ? No, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Bailey was not speaking of any such coincidence of
</p>
<p>opinion ; he was speaking of the criminal conspiracy which exists in
</p>
<p>treason. His remarks had special reference to a case of treason
</p>
<p>and not to a case of political co-operation. And now hear in what lan-
</p>
<p>gnage he expresses himself: " In order to support these it is not ab-

</p>
<p>" solutely necessary that you should have positive evidence from
</p>
<p>" persons who heard them consult, or from persons who heard
</p>
<p>" them conspire, or even that you should have evidence of an ac-
</p>
<p>" tual meeting for that purpose, if you shall find that there was a
</p>
<p>" plan ; and you shall be satisfied from what was done that there
</p>
<p>" must have been previous consultation and conspiracy, either by
</p>
<p>" the persons who are the objects of the charge, or by persons en-
</p>
<p>" gaged with them in the same common purpose and design, that will
</p>
<p>"justify your finding the conspiracy and consultation." There is the
</p>
<p>language of Mr. Justice Bailey. I have read for you the whole pas-
</p>
<p>sage, and not a mere extract ; but in order that you mav clearly un-
</p>
<p>derstand and fully appreciate the force and point of his observations
</p>
<p>it is absolutely essential that you should take into consideration the
</p>
<p>peculiar circumstances under which they were uttered. Mr. Justice
</p>
<p>Bailey, in using those words, was not delivering from the Bench any
</p>
<p>judgment upon -- ooint of law ; nor was he addressing a jury sworn
</p>
<p>392
</p>
<p>to try a man. No ; he was merely giving general directions to a
</p>
<p>Grand Jury. It is from his charge to the Grand Jury that the words
</p>
<p>have been extracted to which the Attorney-General attaches so
</p>
<p>much importance ; but you must bear in mind, that if ever there be
</p>
<p>an occasion when it is admissible for a Judge to deal in generalities,
</p>
<p>and not to pay a very strict attention to the delicate subtleties of'law,
</p>
<p>it is in the case of a charge to a Grand Jury. But what, after all, is
</p>
<p>the inference that is fairly to be drawn from the passage that has been
</p>
<p>so much relied upon ? It is plainly this, that the Jury, in order to a
</p>
<p>conviction, must come to the conclusion that there has been a pre-
</p>
<p>vious consultation and conspiracy, and that they must come to that
</p>
<p>conclusion without any doubt ; but that it is not necessary, in order
</p>
<p>to coming to this conclusion, to have the evidence of some person
</p>
<p>who actually saw the accused parties in the act of consulting.. But
</p>
<p>vou must believe that they did actually consult ; and furthermore,
</p>
<p>that they consulted with a criminal intent as criminal conspirators,
</p>
<p>and that they were conscious of being such when they so consulted.
</p>
<p>All this you must believe before you can find a verdict against the
</p>
<p>party or parties who are put on their trial for conspiracy. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, Mr. Justice Baildty was there also speaking of the crime of
</p>
<p>treason, and expressly distinguishing between that crime and felo-
</p>
<p>nies, he says: "Treason differs from felony in this, that in felony
</p>
<p>" there are accessaries, in treason there are none. And therefore,
</p>
<p>" those who at any period, either before or after the formation of
</p>
<p>" the treasonable conspiracy, concur in the treasonable purpose, are
</p>
<p>" equally guilty with those who are in it from the beginning to the
</p>
<p> end."
</p>
<p>And now, having called your attention to the only two au-
</p>
<p>thorities that have been cited by the Attorney-General, this last
</p>
<p>observation brings me to consider the third position laid down by
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General in his speech. And I beg your attention,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, as British subjects, as men who desire to spend the
</p>
<p>rest of your lives in a country governed by rational laws  as men
</p>
<p>who desire to leave your children the laws as you enjoy them your-

</p>
<p>selves  as men who love justice and honour, as men of integrity of
</p>
<p>purpose, I conjure you to pay attention to the remarks which I will
</p>
<p>offer upon this branch of the case. The Attorney General told you
</p>
<p>that the Repeal Association is a "criminal conspiracy  that every
</p>
<p>man who belongs to it is a criminal conspirator," and he told you that
</p>
<p>"whoever comes into the common purpose or design, is as much in
</p>
<p>it as if he had been in it from the beginning!" Such, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>is the legal proposition which has been laid down by the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General for your consideration and approval  such the proposition
</p>
<p>which you are called upon to ratify and adopt ; and he supports this
</p>
<p>doctrine by the language, which Mr. Justice Bailey used in distin-
</p>
<p>guishing between treason, in which there are no accessaries, and felony
</p>
<p>in which there are accessaries. He wants to prove that the Repeal
</p>
<p>Association is a criminal conspiracy  that every man who belongs to
</p>
<p>it is a criminal conspirator, and he gives his law a wide range, for by
</p>
<p>adopting such a monstrous proposition as this, he gravely tells you
</p>
<p>that every man who comes into a common purpose or design  to wit,
</p>
<p>393
</p>
<p>the common purpose or design of procuring (he Repeal of an Act of
</p>
<p>Parliament, is guilty of and answerable for all the seditious practices
</p>
<p>of all who concur with him in his political object, and who may be
</p>
<p>co-operating with him, no matter how injudiciously, in the attainment
</p>
<p>of that object. And because of the general concurrence of sentiment
</p>
<p>as to one object, every person who joins the Association, must be
</p>
<p>branded as a member of a wicked and illegal conspiracy. I dare say
</p>
<p>the Solicitor-General, who will have the right to reply, will endea-
</p>
<p>vour to get the Attorney-General out of the absurdity in which he
</p>
<p>is thus involved, by explaining that what the Attorney-General meant
</p>
<p>to convey was, that every one who came into a common purpose or
</p>
<p>design to procure the repeal of an Act of Parliament, by illegal or
</p>
<p>seditious means, was to be accounted a conspirator as much as if he
</p>
<p>had been in the design from the very commencement. This explanation
</p>
<p>necessarily involves the assumption that seeking the repeal of a
</p>
<p>Statute, by calling together in peaceful assembly masses of people,
</p>
<p>who conduct themselves, when assembled, legally and decorously, and
</p>
<p>then delivering such speeches as have been read in Court, involves
</p>
<p>the whole proceeding, and every one engaged in it, in illegal prac-
</p>
<p>tices, and affects all who are engaged in the proceedings with the
</p>
<p>guilt of seeking the repeal of the Statute by illegal means. They
</p>
<p>argue that those who call the meetings, and deliver illegal speeches
</p>
<p>at them, are pursuing the common object by illegal means, and are,
</p>
<p>therefore, guilty of conspiracy ; and that those who attend the meet-
</p>
<p>ings, and listen to and approve of the speeches, are also acting in fur-
</p>
<p>therance of the common object, and by coming into the common design,
</p>
<p>aud assenting to the illegal speeches, they become equally guilty with
</p>
<p>those who are in from the beginning; and in support of this argument,
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General has cited to you the words of Mr. Justice Bailey,
</p>
<p>in that case of The King v. Watson, and I, too, will take the liberty
</p>
<p>of citing some passages from the same authority in the same case.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Bailey says, in page 7: "Treason differs from felony
</p>
<p>" in this, in felony there are accessaries ; in treason there are
</p>
<p>"none; what would make an accessary in felony would be a prin-

</p>
<p>" cipal in treason. He who plans the thing." Now, I ask, what thing?
</p>
<p>Is it the thing of meeting to petition Parliament for a Repeal of the
</p>
<p>Union? No such thing; was it the thing of meeting in public and mak-
</p>
<p>ing speeches? No  the thing Mr. Justice Bailey was speaking of was
</p>
<p>high treason. Justice Bailey continues, and says : " He who plans
</p>
<p>the thing, or devises the means by which it is to be effected."
</p>
<p>What was to be effected ? Why, the death of the King, or the
</p>
<p>levying of war against the King. " Or who does any other act prepa-
</p>
<p>" ratory to the execution of the thing proposed, is as much a principal
</p>
<p>" as he who executes that thing." What matter ? High treason. As
</p>
<p>he who executes what ? As he who executes high treason. The
</p>
<p>language of Judge Bailey was applied to high treason and to nothing-
</p>
<p>else. " And provided a man comes once into the common purpose
</p>
<p>and design." What design and what purpose ? not Trfe design or
</p>
<p>purpose of calling or attending a meeting for some avowed-political
</p>
<p>object, or the delivery of political speeches there; no such thing.
</p>
<p>3E
</p>
<p>394
</p>
<p>" Every previous act, with a view to that purpose and design, and
</p>
<p>every subsequent act, is as much his act as if he had done it himself."
</p>
<p>In a case of high treason ; that is the case Justice Bailey is speak-
</p>
<p>ing of. This is the language, spoken by an English judge to a
</p>
<p>grand jury, in his charge to them in a case of treason, not
</p>
<p>spoken of, nor applicable to the case of men politically associ-
</p>
<p>ated together for openly avowed political purposes. Yet this is the
</p>
<p>language brought forward to support the monstrous proposition,
</p>
<p>that any man of the traversers, and any other person who joined
</p>
<p>the Association, whose rules and regulations were published and cir-
</p>
<p>culated to the entire world, from the moment that he so joined it he
</p>
<p>became a conspirator, and criminally reponsible for all the acts of all
</p>
<p>the members of this Association, in furtherance of its objects from
</p>
<p>the beginning. This is the language, I say, brought forward by the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General to support the monstrous proposition that all the
</p>
<p>members of this Association are to be branded as foul conspirators.
</p>
<p>Such are the three propositions of law laid down by her Majesty's
</p>
<p>Attorney-General, touching cases of conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Now let me deal with another proposition of law laid down by the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General, concerning illegal meetings. The law on the subject
</p>
<p>of illegal meetings, and of conspiring to call and to attend illegal meet-
</p>
<p>ings. His view of the law on this subject the Attorney-General sup-
</p>
<p>ports by referring you to the case of Redford v. JBirley, reported in 3
</p>
<p>Starkie's Nisi Prius Cases ; and here I beg leave to give you a short
</p>
<p>history of that case. It is remarkable that the Attorney-General did not
</p>
<p>think it right or prudent to give you any account of it at all. The case of
</p>
<p>Redford v. Birley arose out of a very remarkable and far-famed trans-
</p>
<p>action which occurred in Manchester in 1819. You have all heard of the
</p>
<p>celebrated meeting which took place on the 16th of August, 1819, at
</p>
<p>a place called Peterloo, at Manchester. At that meeting Mr. Hunt
</p>
<p>was in the chair, and while the meeting was going on he was arrested,
</p>
<p>and in the course of dispersing that meeting several people were
</p>
<p>killed and some maimed. Hunt was prosecuted, and the indictment
</p>
<p>charged him, as in the present case, with a conspiracy. The first

</p>
<p>three counts were the principal counts, and charged him with con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. There were also other counts, charging him with attending
</p>
<p>an illegal meeting. The charge of conspiracy was pretty much the
</p>
<p>same as in the present indictment. Hunt was tried with other
</p>
<p>defendants. The Attorney-General of that day in England did not
</p>
<p>think it safe to go to trial on the counts for conspiracy in the indict-
</p>
<p>ment, he knew very well that the crime of conspiracy savoured of
</p>
<p>novelty, and would not be favoured by an English jury, and he
</p>
<p>therefore added a count for attending an illegal assembly. On this
</p>
<p>indictment Hunt was tried at the York assizes, as it was alleged
</p>
<p>he could not get a fair trial at Manchester ; the trial lasted ten days,
</p>
<p>and you may be sure the then Attorney-General brought all the
</p>
<p>evidence he could possibly find to bear on the case. The question
</p>
<p>then was whether a conspiracy had existed before the meeting was
</p>
<p>called, and this question was then brought before the competent
</p>
<p>tribunal, namely, a jury of the country. I say before a jury, for
</p>
<p>395
</p>
<p>I say it is not, by the laws of this realm, competent for any judge
</p>
<p>or any number of judges, to pronounce any man guilty until
</p>
<p>twelve of his fellow-men pronounce him guilty. It was and it is a
</p>
<p>jury, and a jury alone, who were and who are capable of coming to
</p>
<p>the conclusion of what was, and what is, a conspiracy. The jury who
</p>
<p>tried the case of Hunt pronounced him not guilty of the conspiracy,
</p>
<p>and they gave that verdict solemnly and honestly, not because they
</p>
<p>were political partizans of Hunt  not because they were partial to
</p>
<p>the cause he advocated, and they proved the fact of their impartiality
</p>
<p>to the world, by finding him guilty of attending an illegal meeting,
</p>
<p>at the same time that they acquitted him of the conspiracy, and
</p>
<p>therefore they found that the meeting was illegal, while they justly
</p>
<p>pronounced him innocent of the charge of conspiracy. Yet Hunt
</p>
<p>and his associates were proved beyond all doubt to have concurred
</p>
<p>and co-operated with each other, and with divers other persons un-
</p>
<p>known in calling and in attending that meeting. That being the
</p>
<p>result of the prosecution of Hunt for a conspiracy, a man of the name
</p>
<p>of Redford, who was injured at [the meeting, brought an action
</p>
<p>against the captain of yeomanry, who, in dispersing the meeting,
</p>
<p>had wounded this man with his sabre, and for the injury so sus-
</p>
<p>tained a civil action was brought to recover damages. The case was
</p>
<p>tried, and I will call your attention to the pleadings in that case.
</p>
<p>There was a plea of not guilty, the effect of which was to deny every
</p>
<p>thing ; but as it was not safe to defend the case on that plea, and
</p>
<p>because there were certain matters to justify the act, if it should be
</p>
<p>proved against the defendant, several pleas of justification were put
</p>
<p>in, and in them it was alleged that the meeting at which the plaintiff
</p>
<p>had suffered the injury was illegal, and some of the pleas stated that
</p>
<p>the meeting had been called together in consequence of a criminal
</p>
<p>conspiracy, and that in consequence of Redford having attended this
</p>
<p>illegal meeting, the defendant, in the discharge of his duty, had driven
</p>
<p>him away from the meeting, and in so doing had done him as little
</p>
<p>injury as possible. In this plea, you see that a conspiracy was al-
</p>
<p>leged, and of course it then became necessary to prove it, or at least
</p>

</p>
<p>it was competent for the defendant to give evidence of the existence
</p>
<p>of such conspiracy under this plea. In consequence of this, amongst
</p>
<p>other evidence produced on the trial, was a witness who stated that
</p>
<p>two or three nights before the meeting, at a place called the White
</p>
<p>Moss, he saw a great body of men going through exercise or dis-
</p>
<p>cipline like soldiers. This evidence was tendered, and it was received,
</p>
<p>and this witness swore that he was ill used and abused by the parties
</p>
<p>who were so assembled, but that they let him go with his life, and
</p>
<p>that on the next day, when passing his house, on their way to the
</p>
<p>meeting, some persons hissed him. Now, recollect, that this very
</p>
<p>evidence must have been given on the trial of Hunt, when he was
</p>
<p>charged at York with the conspiracy, and if the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>was right, Hunt must have been a conspirator, although he was not
</p>
<p>at the nightly meeting where this man was abused, and where the
</p>
<p>men were drilled ; and yet the jury acquitted him and his co-defend-
</p>
<p>ants of the conspiracy. On the trial of the civil action this evidence
</p>
<p>396
</p>
<p>was objected to, but it was admitted by the judge, and the jury having
</p>
<p>nothing to do with any question except whether the plaintiff, by reason
</p>
<p>of the injury which he had sustained, was entitled to damages, found a
</p>
<p>general verdict for the defendant, but on which of the pleas it did not
</p>
<p>appear. A motion was afterwards made to set aside that verdict, on the
</p>
<p>ground that illegal evidence was allowed to go to the jury, but it was
</p>
<p>refused. And now, Gentlemen, we come to the authority which the'
</p>
<p>Attorney-General says this case affords on the question, whether or
</p>
<p>not a conspiracy exists in the case now before you. This authority
</p>
<p>exists in the dicta of the judges in refusing to set aside the verdict.
</p>
<p>But first of all those dicta, whatever may be their value, were all
</p>
<p>spoken in reference to the case before the Court, and in reference to
</p>
<p>the question before the Court, that question being narrowly and sim-
</p>
<p>ply whether or not the evidence of those drillings two nights before
</p>
<p>the meeting was admissible, to show the jury that there was an illegal
</p>
<p>conspiracy, such conspiracy being directly averred in one of the pleas
</p>
<p>in that case. Now, mind, the jury had acquitted Mr- Hunt of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy, where it was the question they had to try ; the jury found
</p>
<p>a verdict in this case for the defendant, which they might have done
</p>
<p>without believing that there had been any conspiracy. The ques-
</p>
<p>tion before the court on the new trial, motion, and the only
</p>
<p>question, was, were these drillings evidence to go to the jury, of
</p>
<p>a conspiracy, not whether they proved a conspiracy, but whe-
</p>
<p>ther there was such evidence of a conspiracy, afforded by the nightly
</p>
<p>..meetings, as ought to have been submitted to the jury, that they
</p>
<p>might exercise their judgment upon it in coming to the conclusion
</p>
<p>whether there was a conspiracy or not. And it is from the dicta of
</p>
<p>judges in pronouncing judgment upon the question of the admissibi-
</p>
<p>lity of this evidence, that is, upon a mere question of law, and that
</p>
<p>question brought in that way by motion before the Court, that the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General has endeavoured to prove as a matter of fact lhat
</p>
<p>there is a conspiracy in the present case, and that the meetings in the
</p>
<p>present case were illegal meetings. Gentlemen, from that case he cited
</p>
<p>for you a part of the judgment of a very learned judge, Mr. Justice Best,

<p>now Lord Wynford. He cited these words for you, and these only,
</p>
<p>viz. : " It appears to me impossible to say that this drilling was inno-
</p>
<p>cent. If it is not innocent, what is it?" He stated this sentence
</p>
<p>from page 125 of the Report. Gentlemen, in estimating the value of
</p>
<p>the dicta of judges, when cited by lawyers in cases in which they
</p>
<p>have a great interest, I hope you will bear in mind this dictum as it
</p>
<p>has been cited. This dictum was cited for the purpose of leading you to
</p>
<p>the conclusion that the drillings which were alleged to have taken place
</p>
<p>amongst the Repealers, but which were not proved to have taken
</p>
<p>place, were criminal and illegal drillings ; and Mr. Attorney-General
</p>
<p>read for you an isolated sentence, at the conclusion of the first column
</p>
<p>of page 125, and there he stopped. Don't you think, Gentlemen, that
</p>
<p>in common fairness he ought to have read for you the charge respect-
</p>
<p>ing the drillings of which Justice Best was speaking, to which the word
</p>
<p>" this" refers ? Now, if there was an explanation of that pronoun in the
</p>
<p>judge's own language, and in the very same page from which he was cit-
</p>
<p>397
</p>
<p>ing, in fairness to him, don't you think he ought to have read it ? If he
</p>
<p>wished to influence you by the opinion of that learned Judge, ex-
</p>
<p>pressed in the sentence he read, do not you think common fair
</p>
<p>dealing towards you should have made him read what that word
</p>
<p>" this" referred to ? But he did not explain it ; he left that for me
</p>
<p>to do, and I will do it, and do it with note and commentary. Now
</p>
<p>let us see what was the drilling that Lord Wynford was speaking of.
</p>
<p>" It is said" (alluding to the excuse made for the drilling in the parti-
</p>
<p>cular case, in reference to which Mr. Justice Best was speaking  mind
</p>
<p>that he was speaking of the drilling which was proved in that case to
</p>
<p>have taken place), " It is said," he observed, " that this drilling was
</p>
<p>" for the purpose of enabling a large concourse of people to be at the
</p>
<p>" same spot of ground." That was the excuse given for the drilling
</p>
<p>of which he was speaking. " This is truly ridiculous," he says. He
</p>
<p>says it is truly ridiculous to give this excuse for the particular kind
</p>
<p>of drilling that was proved in this case to have taken place. "Drilling
</p>
<p>in no case would be necessary for that ;" that is, for bringing large
</p>
<p>masses of people together to the same spot. "It is mere pretence;
</p>
<p>but if it were necessary for that, they need not go to this extent."
</p>
<p>It is worthy of your attention, that here Mr. Justice Best plainly ex-
</p>
<p>presses the opinion that if drilling was necessary for the mere pur-
</p>
<p>pose of enabling great concourses of people to come together with-
</p>
<p>out confusion or injury to each other  without creating alarm to
</p>
<p>themselves or other people if drilling were necessary for that pur-
</p>
<p>pose, the kind of drilling necessary for that purpose, provided it did
</p>
<p>nol go further, would be justifiable and legal ; that is plainly to be
</p>
<p>collected from his language. " They need not go to the extent of not
</p>
<p>" merely putting themselves in close order, but up to the full extent,
</p>
<p>" short of having arms in their hands, namely, the act of firing. For se-
</p>
<p>" veral of the witnesses speak of their not only forming in ranks, but of
</p>
<p>" the words of command being given, such as 'make ready,' 'present,'
</p>
<p>" 'fire."' Here is the drilling Lord Wynford was speaking of. This is
</p>
<p>the species of drilling which he referred to by the pronoun "this," in
</p>
<p>the short sentence read by the Attorney-General, and Mr. Justice Best

</p>
<p>goes on and says : " This is a species of drilling which I state again, as
</p>
<p>" it appears to me, never could have been had recourse to for any in-
</p>
<p>" nocent purpose." Here, Gentlemen, is the drilling which Mr. Justice
</p>
<p>Best was speaking of. That learned judge goes on : " There is also most
</p>
<p>" material evidence on that part of the case, from one of the witnesses
</p>
<p>" who says they were ordered to advance in front  and on the sound
</p>
<p>" of the trumpet, fall on their faces, as in the drillings of light infantry."
</p>
<p>These are the drillings of which Justice Best said: " It appeared
</p>
<p>to him impossible to say that they were innocent." Is it fair  is it
</p>
<p>fair, let me ask, to read the sentence the Attorney-General read,
</p>
<p>which speaks of this drilling of which I have now read for you the
</p>
<p>description, without bringing under your notice what this drilling
</p>
<p>was ? Gentlemen, if there exists a case in which a lawyer of the mean-
</p>
<p>est order, in citing the law, or the opinion of a judge, for the purpose
</p>
<p>of coercing a jury, is bound to cite it candidly, fully, and fairly, that
</p>
<p>case is the case of a state prosecution. If there be a case in which
</p>
<p>398
</p>
<p>common humanity requires that the law should be fairly and candidly
</p>
<p>cited, when cited against the party accused by the public prosecutor,
</p>
<p>it is a case where a man of his own rank, of his own Profession  who
</p>
<p>was, for nearly half a century, an ornament of that Profession  who
</p>
<p>was, for nearly half a century, without any disparagement of the At-
</p>
<p>torney-General, his clearly admitted superior in all particulars of pro-
</p>
<p>fessional excellence ; if there be a case in which every ennobling feel-
</p>
<p>ing that belongs to the human kind, in any heart where feeling has
</p>
<p>found a footing, it is this case, where a man in the discharge of a
</p>
<p>public duty, has the painful task imposed upon him of driving in-
</p>
<p>to a prison, to eke out in miserable wretchedness the evening of a
</p>
<p>long life  his brother-barrister  his fellow-man  who has nearly
</p>
<p>completed that measure of human life that is said to be its full
</p>
<p>extent, and to consign him to eke out the little of that life that
</p>
<p>now remains, in the cold and freezing atmosphere of a dungeon.
</p>
<p>That is the case which ought to suggest fairness and candour, if
</p>
<p>not lenity and forbearance. That is the case in which I would say,
</p>
<p>standing to defend myself against my brother-barrister, if it should be
</p>
<p>his duty, as Attorney-General, to prosecute me, in which, conscious
</p>
<p>of innocence, I would say to him, my brother, do your duty  do it
</p>
<p>like a man  strike hard, but strike fairly ! I would say to him, strike
</p>
<p>fairly; but if you aim below the belt, I repeat it, although I may suc-
</p>
<p>ceed in parrying your blow, you are no longer the antagonist entitled
</p>
<p>to any respect, or entitled to any quarter. Am I, Gentlemen, be-
</p>
<p>cause I am not here in my own case, am I not to fight this battle as I
</p>
<p>would fight it for myself? Gentlemen, it may be productive of bad
</p>
<p>consequences to me in my career to do so ; but I cannot regard that ;
</p>
<p>I shall never eat the guilty bread which is earned by professional
</p>
<p>subserviency. I shall not retire to my pillow borne down with the
</p>
<p>remorseful feeling that I was an example of dereliction of duty, as I
</p>
<p>should be if I should not say for this young man everything which he
</p>
<p>would be justified in saying for himself; if I should not say for him
</p>
<p>every word which I would say for myself, were I here the party ac-
</p>
<p>cused.

</p>
<p>Such, Gentlemen, has been the statement of the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General in this prosecution as to the law ; and after so stating the law,
</p>
<p>he then came to the facts of what he termed this momentous case. I
</p>
<p>agree with him ; it is a momentous case ; but I doubt that we shall
</p>
<p>agree in the reasons for calling it a momentous case. That he thinks
</p>
<p>it a momentous case I have no doubt, in reference to the effect it must
</p>
<p>have upon his position with his own party. He feels it to be a momen-
</p>
<p>tous case, and it is because he feels it to be a momentous case in re-
</p>
<p>ference to himself, that this want of candour has stolen upon him, as
</p>
<p>it ever does, and ever has done, and ever will do, when the party is
</p>
<p>himself conducting his own case as the litigant. The prosecutor
</p>
<p>here is not acting merely on the motives of counsel, but in a
</p>
<p>sense also for himself, in support of his credit with his party.
</p>
<p>He would have you to consider this a momentous case; because
</p>
<p>your verdict of " guilty" or " not guilty," may affect the peace and
</p>
<p>quietness of the country ? But whatever may be its effect on the
</p>
<p>399
</p>
<p>community at large, I deny the right of any community, because it
</p>
<p>may be useful to themselves, to take one farthing of the property, or
</p>
<p>to touch one hair of the head of any man, or to deprive any man of
</p>
<p>one moment's liberty, because it may be useful to them or to the
</p>
<p>state to do so  common justice revolts at the notion of inflicting
</p>
<p>punishment on one man to serve the purposes of others, however
</p>
<p>numerous. Your verdict of guilty or not guilty mayor may not be
</p>
<p>serviceable to the community. But I deny your right, when con-
</p>
<p>sidering the question of guilt or innocence, to entertain one thought
</p>
<p>of the effect of your verdict upon the people at large, or even on
</p>
<p>the whole human race. Gentlemen of the jury, when a man is
</p>
<p>fairly convicted  when a jury pronounce him to be a criminal  then
</p>
<p>arises the question how he is to be dealt with as to his punishment,
</p>
<p>having reference to the good of the country. But while I stand
</p>
<p>here on trial, and until 1 am found guilty, I am presumed by the
</p>
<p>law to be innocent, and it is then a fair ingredient in the consideration
</p>
<p>of the weight of punishment ; the public good may then be consi-
</p>
<p>dered in measuring the punishment. I deny the right of any human
</p>
<p>being to plead his own good as a reason for my conviction. Yet this
</p>
<p>is the reason involved in the suggestion made to you, that this is a
</p>
<p>momentous case. Let me now give you my reason for thinking this a
</p>
<p>momentous case. Gentlemen, you cannot be ignorant of the history of
</p>
<p>your own country, and of England, and it may also be said, of every
</p>
<p>other country in Europe ; you cannot be ignorant of the change which
</p>
<p>took place in human affairs when the Roman Empire withdrew its
</p>
<p>forces from its distant dominions, and when the northern hordes
</p>
<p>poured down upon the Roman provinces in the centre of Europe,
</p>
<p>and established themselves in power. A very slight knowledge is
</p>
<p>enough to inform you of the condition in which William the Conquer-
</p>
<p>or found England. Two-thirds of the whole population of the is-
</p>
<p>land were bond-slaves and serfs, over whom the power of life and
</p>
<p>death was exercised by the remaining one-third. They were brought
</p>
<p>and sold in the market like cattle ; and the first act towards the
</p>
<p>rescuing of those wretched people from that most degraded of all

</p>
<p>human conditions, was the act of accepting their fealty, for it was
</p>
<p>he who first introduced the feudal law, and the accepting of that
</p>
<p>fealty made it at once illegal to kill those whose fealty was so accepted ;
</p>
<p>and while the conqueror imagined that he was securing the submis-
</p>
<p>sion of these serfs, he was in effect releasing them from former
</p>
<p>bondage and conferring rights where none had previously existed.
</p>
<p>From that hour down to the present time, in these countries, the
</p>
<p>mass of the people have been, from time to time, and from age to
</p>
<p>age, and from generation to generation, writhing under, and strug-
</p>
<p>gling out of, the bondage which was thus partially relaxed, and to
</p>
<p>which, by the Saxon conquest, the people of Britain had been sub-
</p>
<p>jected in the early part of our history. From the moment when
</p>
<p>any civil right was conferred, as it was by accepting fealty, the
</p>
<p>people have been struggling by periodical exhibitions of their
</p>
<p>strength, to extend their rights to procure redress of the wrongs
</p>
<p>400
</p>
<p>they were suffering. Now, give me your attention for a mo-
</p>
<p>ment, and you will see what a monstrous case this is, and wherein
</p>
<p>its great importance consists. This indictment does not charge
</p>
<p>the defendants with seeking to obtain their object by the use
</p>
<p>of force. There is no such charge in the indictment. It does not.
</p>
<p>allege that they had in view, or in contemplation at all, the use of
</p>
<p>physical force. The exhibition of it is the only charge made, or
</p>
<p>rather a conspiracy to exhibit it ; for although the actual exhibition
</p>
<p>of physical force is acknowledged, and was openly made, no charge
</p>
<p>is made that a crime was committed by such actual exhibition, but
</p>
<p>the whole charge consists in an alleged conspiracy to make such exhi-
</p>
<p>bition of it. Now, let us for a moment consider what is meant by
</p>
<p>this exhibition of physical force. A great mass of the community is
</p>
<p>dissatisfied with the present law, and those who are dissatisfied want
</p>
<p>to alter it, and they come forward in masses  in immense numbers,
</p>
<p>to express their desire that it shall be altered, and their determina-
</p>
<p>tion never to stop, never to stay in their constitutional and legal
</p>
<p>efforts to have that law altered, until it shall be repealed ; and they, in
</p>
<p>the strongest language, declare their determination never to cease
</p>
<p>using every effort which the law and the constitution will sanction, to
</p>
<p>have that law repealed. In the course of this pressing struggle of
</p>
<p>the people for a repeal of that law, they come forward in great num-
</p>
<p>bers for the avowed and loudly proclaimed purpose of showing, by a
</p>
<p>public demonstration of their numbers, what an immense mass of the
</p>
<p>community, and what an immense proportion of the physical and the
</p>
<p>moral strength of the community is favourable to the change they
</p>
<p>want to make, and that is what the Attorney-General of Ireland
</p>
<p>comes here to prosecute as a crime. I would ask, does the Attorney
</p>
<p>\ General think that Magna Charta was procured by crime? I would
</p>
<p>ask was there any exhibition of physical force at Runymede, although
</p>
<p>it is certain there was no use made of it ? I ask was there not a
</p>
<p>demonstration of physical force upon the plain of Runymede, when
</p>
<p>the iron barons of England, not unarmed like those at Tara and Mul-
</p>
<p>laghmast, but fully armed, presented themselves as persuasive suitors

</p>
<p>before their sovereign, to ask him, by way of favour, to sign the Char-
</p>
<p>ter they had brought in their hands ready for him ? Was there no
</p>
<p>exhibition of physical force there ? Yet that is the Charter which no
</p>
<p>Attorney-General  no! no judge! nor no king of England, dare to
</p>
<p>say was illegally procured or void because of its having been procured
</p>
<p>by demonstration of physical force ? Is that the only instance in
</p>
<p>English history of great reformations being accomplished by the exhi-
</p>
<p>bition of the mighty proportion in their favour of the physical and
</p>
<p>moral force of the country ? No, there are other instances. Let
</p>
<p>me ask you has any great measure been ever attained except by the
</p>
<p>means imputed to the defendants? Look to the Clare election;
</p>
<p>what was that ? Was not that an exhibition of great physical force ?
</p>
<p>Why were not the people who assembled there prosecuted ? Why
</p>
<p>was that demonstration of physical force allowed to be successful?
</p>
<p>If the people there acted illegally, why were they rewarded by
</p>
<p>401
</p>
<p>emancipation. If the people be now acting only as they acted then,
</p>
<p>why should they be then rewarded  why should they be now pro-
</p>
<p>secuted ? If the great mass of the country be galled  if they be
</p>
<p>suffering, why should they be repressed from the expression of their
</p>
<p>feelings, the result of that suffering? Why then is this a momen-
</p>
<p>tous case ? Because it is a case by means of which, and by means of
</p>
<p>your verdict in it, the present ministry are seeking to get into their
</p>
<p>hands a scourge by which they may in future be able to repress the
</p>
<p>public expression, the multitudinous expression of the feelings of all
</p>
<p>men in the country who may not be of the ruling party. That is a
</p>
<p>thing for which every ministry in every period of English history has
</p>
<p>been anxiously striving, yet, not one of them to the present hour
</p>
<p>has succeeded. Why have they not succeeded ? Gentlemen, it was not
</p>
<p>the judges of the land that stood between them and the attainment
</p>
<p>of their object  never. I do not despair that this case will furnish
</p>
<p>an instance in which the Judges of the land will stand between the
</p>
<p>minister and the accomplishment of his criminal purpose. But to the
</p>
<p>honour of England and of English juries, no minister has been able to
</p>
<p>attain that object there. At an early period, and in the worst pe-
</p>
<p>riod of our history, the state lawyers devised what is called con-
</p>
<p>structive treason. The Statute of Edward III. for the protection
</p>
<p>of the subject, gave a narrow and precise definition of that offence,
</p>
<p>but state lawyers and state Judges, in order to repress popular
</p>
<p>outcry and complaint by ingenious constructions of this clear and
</p>
<p>simple Act of Parliament, extended it to cases plainly not within
</p>
<p>either its letter or its spirit. But the Legislature from time to time
</p>
<p>yielding to the force of public opinion, swept away all these construc-
</p>
<p>tions, and on the return of reason restored the British law again.
</p>
<p>The last attempt to revive constructive treason  a foul attempt  was
</p>
<p>made in the prosecution of Hardy and Tooke, in 1794; that was a
</p>
<p>period of great political anxiety, when the affairs of France presented
</p>
<p>a spectacle which every lover of peace and order, every man who had
</p>
<p>the peace and happiness of mankind at heart, felt alarm for the safety
</p>
<p>of our institutions, and it was supposed would join in support of the

<p>minister with all possible alacrity in averting the evil from his own
</p>
<p>country. That was a time at which one of the ablest, one of the
</p>
<p>most learned, one of the most artful men that ever was at the bar in
</p>
<p>England was Attorney-General. They framed upon that occasion
</p>
<p>an indictment for high treason against a great man  a very popular
</p>
<p>man  a very learned man, I mean Home Tooke. They assembled
</p>
<p>a jury upon that occasion ; they got hold of the papers of the two
</p>
<p>societies of which Home Tooke was a member, they, as in this
</p>
<p>case, raised a chaos of political writings and speeches on the table,
</p>
<p>they threw down piles of papers, and desired the jury, and in-
</p>
<p>geniously sought to induce them to spell out treason from the
</p>
<p>mass. That prosecution was countenanced by the greatest au-
</p>
<p>thority then on the Bench, it was carried on, it was pressed on
</p>
<p>with the ability that both the Attorney-General and Solicitor-
</p>
<p>General of that day possessed, and they were both great men.
</p>
<p>That prosecution, however, failed ; the common sense of the jury,
</p>
<p>3F
</p>
<p>402
</p>
<p>who were Englishmen, found a verdict against the Crown and de-
</p>
<p>feated the prosecution. But it was not given up after one defeat ;
</p>
<p>they first proceeded against Hardy, the poor shoemaker, and he was
</p>
<p>acquitted. That did not satisfy the assailants of British liberty ; they
</p>
<p>brought it before another jury ; they drained the cup to the dregs, and
</p>
<p>put all the accused parties successively on trial one by one ; they were
</p>
<p>not satisfied with one or two or three trials and acquittals ; but in the
</p>
<p>end a number of successive juries, composed of sensible Englishmen,
</p>
<p>defeated their attempt. That was the last attempt made in England
</p>
<p>to establish constructive treason. I trust it will be the last. I
</p>
<p>hope, Gentlemen, that you will not misinterpret any observations
</p>
<p>which in the course of this trial I may deem it my duty to address
</p>
<p>to you in reference to the conduct of those who have conducted this
</p>
<p>prosecution on the part of the Crown, and I trust you will invariably
</p>
<p>keep it in mind that however strong may be my animadversions on
</p>
<p>the course pursued by any of the law officers, it is not my language
</p>
<p>you are listening to, but the language of accused men in their de-
</p>
<p>fence. It is not my intention to attribute impure motives in any
</p>
<p>quarter, for I have nothing to do with the motives of any man in this
</p>
<p>case. It is my duty to analyse their official acts, and their official
</p>
<p>acts I will analyse, tor it would be the grossest injustice to the de-
</p>
<p>fendants in this case that your attention should not be called to
</p>
<p>every act of the prosecutors in order that you may not be deceived,
</p>
<p>or improperly influenced in your verdict by any any professional im-
</p>
<p>propriety they may have been guilty of. There are certain rules
</p>
<p>which ought to be observed in the conducting of all legal investiga-
</p>
<p>tions, and more particularly in criminal cases, and when, as in duty
</p>
<p>bound, I shall come to make observations on the breaches of these
</p>
<p>rules that have been committed in the present case, I trust you will
</p>
<p>not forget that it is against the officer and not against the man that my
</p>
<p>remarks shall be directed.
</p>
<p>Let me now call your attention to the statement of the facts
</p>
<p>of this case, as he called them, made by the Attorney-General ;
</p>
<p>but first permit me to put you in possession of what I understand

</p>
<p>to be the rule of the law, and of the Profession in relation to
</p>
<p>the statement of counsel. When a counsel rises to state the
</p>
<p>facts of a case, he expects not to be interrupted ; and the rule
</p>
<p>is that he shall not be interrupted  interruption always leads to
</p>
<p>anger, and hardly ever to any useful result, therefore the proper rule is to
</p>
<p>permit the counsel against you to state his case without interruption,
</p>
<p>and he does so upon the understanding that he will not state against
</p>
<p>the party, and especially against an accused party, anything that he him-
</p>
<p>self as a lawyer does not feel persuaded that he will be able subsequently
</p>
<p>to substantiate and give in evidence against the person charged. Now
</p>
<p>mind that is the rule, and there is always an understanding that,
</p>
<p>while enjoying the benefit of the rule he will by no means transgress
</p>
<p>that rule by stating what he knows he cannot prove, or by reading
</p>
<p>documents which he knows cannot be made admissible in evidence
</p>
<p>against the party. With this understanding the counsel goes on and
</p>
<p>states his case, consisting of the matter against the party accused, and
</p>
<p>then he is to bring evidence in support of the statement. Now let us
</p>
<p>403
</p>
<p>see the course which was pursued by the Attorney-General. He
</p>
<p>commenced by stating to you that shortly after the Emancipation
</p>
<p>Act passed, that is, in the year 1831, the then Lord Lieutenant of
</p>
<p>Ireland issued a proclamation ; and he not only told you that as a fact
</p>
<p>which he did not afterwards attempt to prove, but he read every word
</p>
<p>of that alleged proclamation for you. Yes, he read it every word,
</p>
<p>for what purpose ? Why, to prove a case of conspiracy against men
</p>
<p>now on their trial, who were then boys at school, and were not, nor
</p>
<p>could not, then be engaged in the association against which that pro-
</p>
<p>clamation was issued, or in any association whatever. The Attorney-
</p>
<p>General read that document to you which had been issued in the year
</p>
<p>1831, in order to brand as seditious the agitation then carried on on the
</p>
<p>question of a Repeal of the Union. He read it as evidence against men
</p>
<p>who are accused of a crime alleged to have been committed by them
</p>
<p>thirteen years after that proclamation issued. They are now accused of
</p>
<p>conspiracy,because they agitate the question of the Hepealof the Union,
</p>
<p>and the question is whether they have criminally conspired to agitate
</p>
<p>that question. Let it be remembered the document was read in the year
</p>
<p>1844, just thirteen years after it was issued ; what evidence, I ask you,
</p>
<p>has he given to prove it was issued at all, or that such a document
</p>
<p>was ever published to the world ? He read the document, and closed
</p>
<p>the case for the Crown without attempting to make that document
</p>
<p>evidence against the traversers. He contented himself with the
</p>
<p>reading of it. He did not attempt to make evidence of that paper,
</p>
<p>and he calls on you to attend to a document which he must have
</p>
<p>known was inadmissible as evidence. Upon what principle of law
</p>
<p>upon what principle of justice  -upon what principle of fair play, did
</p>
<p>he seek to influence your verdict by the reading of that document ?
</p>
<p>I now ask him for his excuse for this conduct, for reading a paper in
</p>
<p>1844 which he alleges was published thirteen years before, and of
</p>
<p>one particular of which he has not attempted to give even a shadow
</p>
<p>of evidence. The rule of law in this case is not at all different from
</p>
<p>the rule where a man may happen to be prosecuted for murder.
</p>
<p>Well, suppose in the year 1844, that a man was prosecuted for mur-

</p>
<p>der, and that the prosecuting counsel read a document in which a man
</p>
<p>of great authority and note had some thirteen years before published
</p>
<p>a statement to the world, asserting that murders of a similar nature
</p>
<p>and similar in facts, were very rife in his neighbourhood, and that
</p>
<p>such murders were of a shocking character, and that certain persons,
</p>
<p>being the offenders, ought to be punished, I ask, would that be a fair
</p>
<p>document to read to the Jury in order to connect that man with
</p>
<p>something that had taken place thirteen years before, and with which
</p>
<p>it is confessed he had nothing to do? Would such a course be just,
</p>
<p>or would it not be an unfair contrivance for the purpose of affecting
</p>
<p>the minds of the Jury with prejudice against the man then before
</p>
<p>them, not by anything the man himself had done, but by an ex-parte
</p>
<p>statement which had been published thirteen years before his trial, by
</p>
<p>a man of influence ? The Attorney General read the paper alluded
</p>
<p>to, and let me ask you for what purpose ? Was it not plainly for
</p>
<p>the purpose of inducing you to believe that the Repeal agitation was
</p>
<p>404
</p>
<p>thirteen years ago branded as sedition by the then Lord Lieutenant?
</p>
<p>Why should the opinion of the then Lord Lieutenant, expressed on
</p>
<p>the then agitation, be read in evidence against Dr. Gray, who was then
</p>
<p>at school, and had nothing to do with that agitation ? But he did
</p>
<p>not stop at the reading of that paper. He told you that Lord Al-
</p>
<p>thorp, in his place in the House of Commons, in 1831, had desig-
</p>
<p>nated Mr. O'Connell's agitation for a Repeal of the Union as insur-
</p>
<p>rectionary and Kebellious. Did the Attorney General prove to you
</p>
<p>that Lord Althorp ever made such a speech at all ? He was bound
</p>
<p>to do that, as he made the assertion in his opening statement to you.
</p>
<p>Did the Attorney General even make an attempt to do so ? No, he
</p>
<p>did not. Then why read this alleged speech to you at all? He also
</p>
<p>told you that in the year 1834, Lord John Russell also made a speech
</p>
<p>in the House of Commons, and that he said the Repeal of the Union
</p>
<p>would be a dismemberment of the empire  that it would be destruc-
</p>
<p>tive of monarchy, and would be the means of establishing a ferocious
</p>
<p>republic. I ask you is that the way to deal justly with a man on his
</p>
<p>trial? Upon what principle of law or of justice is the abuse of a po-
</p>
<p>litical opponent, uttered in a privileged place, behind the back of
</p>
<p>the party abused, to be given in evidence and read, not only
</p>
<p>against the party abused, but against other parties not at all con-
</p>
<p>nected with him at the time of the abuse, nor for many years after.
</p>
<p>The question being, whether this agitation be criminal or not, is it
</p>
<p>the way to deal with a man on trial for taking part in it, to read
</p>
<p>against him the abuse of his political opponent? I ask, is there any
</p>
<p>justification of such conduct on the part of the Attorney General?
</p>
<p>Is it just, is it legal for the Attorney General to affect your minds
</p>
<p>by this abuse, in his opening statement, and sit down without offer-
</p>
<p>ing you one single particle of evidence on the subject? Not only
</p>
<p>without attempting to argue that these speeches of Lord Althorp and
</p>
<p>Lord John Russell are evidence against the traversers, but without
</p>
<p>attempting to prove that any such speeches were even in fact spoken.
</p>
<p>Is it legal to tell you the object of the defendants was branded by
</p>
<p>Lord John Russell in 1834, as tending towards anarchy and a dis-

</p>
<p>memberment of the empire, and the establishing of a ferocious re-
</p>
<p>public ? He told you also that Lord Ebrington, when Lord Lieute-
</p>
<p>nant of Ireland, had said that he had a great horror of civil war, but
</p>
<p>that he would prefer a civil war to a Repeal of the Union. I ask was
</p>
<p>this fair, legal, or just in the Attorney General? Was it a fair act
</p>
<p>on his part, as a prosecutor, to read for you the statements of Lord
</p>
<p>Ebrington, of Lord Althorp, and Lord John Russell, the bitter op-
</p>
<p>ponents, on this question, of Mr. O'Connell, and to do so without
</p>
<p>giving any evidence, not only to render these speeches admissible in
</p>
<p>evidence against the traversers, but without one shred of evidence
</p>
<p>that any such speeches were ever delivered at all. What legal right
</p>
<p>had he to do so ? None whatever.
</p>
<p>Now, let me bring back your attention to the definition given
</p>
<p>by the Attorney General of conspiracy ; he stated that it was a
</p>
<p>conspiracy to combine to effect a lawful object by unlawful means.
</p>
<p>I ask you here, and I ask you confidently, was it legal for the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General to read those alleged proclamations and speeches
</p>
<p>405
</p>
<p>against the traversers? I presume he did so on consultation with
</p>
<p>his colleagues. Assuming that the object which they are pursuing,
</p>
<p>that is a conviction, to be a legal object  in thus illegally read-
</p>
<p>ing this alleged proclamation, and these speeches, are they not pur-
</p>
<p>suing that object by illegal means ; and are they not, therefore,
</p>
<p>conspirators within the very terms of their own definition ? Will any
</p>
<p>one of his colleagues tell you he was entitled to state to you the
</p>
<p>speeches of Spring Rice, and the other persons alluded to, knowing,
</p>
<p>as he must have known, that he could not make evidence of one sen-
</p>
<p>tence of them against the traversers? Were those not illegal means
</p>
<p>of attaining the object which he had in view  the conviction of these
</p>
<p>traversers ? I say his official conduct in that particular was most illegal.
</p>
<p>If ever there was a case in which the statement ought to be confined
</p>
<p>within the strict limit of the law, and solely to the proofs, it is the
</p>
<p>case where the highest law officer of the Crown is prosecuting a fel-
</p>
<p>low-subject no matter how humble, no matter for what alleged crime ;
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General, with the influence of Government at his back,
</p>
<p>is bound by every tie to confine himself to strict legal rules ; but the
</p>
<p>instances I have given you are not the only instances I have to give
</p>
<p>you of a departure from legal rules by the Attorney-General, in the
</p>
<p>present case. Gentlemen, I spoke to you of the proneness of state
</p>
<p>lawyers to indulge in this departure from legal rules, in their anxiety
</p>
<p>to procure convictions ; even my amiable friend, Sergeant Warren,
</p>
<p>could not resist the temptation of being irregular, in this state prose-
</p>
<p>cution. You all remember the witness Johnston, who was examined
</p>
<p>relative to the meeting at Longford. Do you remember Sergeant
</p>
<p>Warren standing up to re-examine him ? Gentlemen, counsel has
</p>
<p>a right, after a cross-examination is over, to re-examine a witness  to
</p>
<p>ask him for an explanation of anything arising on the cross-examina-
</p>
<p>tion. You may remember a passage in that man's evidence in which
</p>
<p>he spoke of a significant pause made by Mr. O'Connell, which he
</p>
<p>would have you to understand had something seditious in it. My
</p>
<p>friend, Sergeant Warren  do not imagine I speak disrespectfully of
</p>
<p>him  I wish it to be fully understood that 1 do not  no man could

</p>
<p>do so of him. He has not, in or out of the Profession, a superior in
</p>
<p>every good and moral qualification, nor breathes there a human being
</p>
<p>that with greater pleasure bears testimony to it than I do. But I am
</p>
<p>here using the language of an accused man, I am here in defence
</p>
<p>of a client, dealing with Sergeant Warren's conduct in this case, and
</p>
<p>1 could not forgive myself, as I said before, if I did not deal with his
</p>
<p>conduct as it deserves ; without regard to the respect which his con-
</p>
<p>duct on all other occasions deserves. I had cross-examined the wit-
</p>
<p>ness as to the pause. What was Sergeant Warren's question on re-
</p>
<p>examination ?  " Did you ever hear of cat's paws ? " Yes," said the
</p>
<p>flippant witness, " I have heard of people making cats' paws of others,"
</p>
<p>se servir tie la patte du chat pour tirer les marrons dufeu  that is,
</p>
<p>use the cat's paws to pull the roasted chesnuts out of the fire. Now,
</p>
<p>as a pun, this does no credit to the learned Sergeant ; as a joke, it is
</p>
<p>unseemly and unseasonable ; as an insinuation, I do not think it was
</p>
<p>very generous. 1 think too, that it was incautious, but it only shows
</p>
<p>406
</p>
<p>how liable to forgetfulness of the circumstances in which they may be
</p>
<p>placed state prosecutors may be. As an insinuation, this pun certain-
</p>
<p>ly deserves my notice, and it is my duty to observe on it. It insinu-
</p>
<p>ated that the traversers, or some of them, made cats' paws of the peo-
</p>
<p>ple  that they, under colour of patriotic views, were using the people
</p>
<p>as dupes for their private advantage. I do not know why my learned
</p>
<p>friends who conduct this prosecution should claim a peculiar protec-
</p>
<p>tion for their own feelings, and an exemption from the imputation of
</p>
<p>motives, while they impute, thus irregularly and improperly, motives
</p>
<p>to the traversers who are now upon their trial, and the issue being,
</p>
<p>whether they shall leave this court stamped as foul conspirators, or as
</p>
<p>gentlemen of station in society ? Have I dealt unjustly with this
</p>
<p>joke? Could any man say I did my duty, if I did not observe upon
</p>
<p>it? I do not know whether it ever entered into the head of a state
</p>
<p>prosecutor to make a " cat's paw " of a Jury to draw nuts out of the
</p>
<p>fire for himself : but I know that when people make imputations of
</p>
<p>this kind, they ought to bear in mind the position in which they stand.
</p>
<p>However, Gentlemen, whatever nuts may be drawn out of the fire by
</p>
<p>means of your verdict in the present case, neither you nor I may ex-
</p>
<p>pect to get any of them. And I do not know why my client, who is
</p>
<p>beside me, should not point over there, and express his hope that the
</p>
<p>learned Sergeant may get a large nut out of the fire, as a consequence
</p>
<p>of your verdict. Gentlemen, I cannot avoid saying, that there if
</p>
<p>something in these state prosecutions that makes men forget, them-
</p>
<p>selves. Gentlemen, the Solicitor-General is as calm, as cool, as per-
</p>
<p>fectly regulated an individual, as is to be found in the Profession, and
</p>
<p>has he forgotten himself in this case ? Gentlemen, when I used a legal
</p>
<p>argument the other day, and when I said that the Jury List might have
</p>
<p>been legally corrected before the forty-eight names were drawn from it,
</p>
<p>and that it ought to have been corrected, my friend, the Solicitor-Ge-
</p>
<p>neral proceeded to show that it would not be legal to correct it, and he
</p>
<p>concluded by this observation, " and this is the argument of one of
</p>
<p>her Majesty's counsel," alluding to what I had professionally said.
</p>
<p>Now, that, to my humble understanding, just meant this, and nothing

</p>
<p>more or less than this : the man that could utter such an absurdity in
</p>
<p>the shape of a legal proposition, in a Court of law, ought not to wear
</p>
<p>a silk gown. Whether I ought to wear it or not, it is on my back,
</p>
<p>and it came there not by any asking of mine, and since I got it 1 do
</p>
<p>not feel myself to be a different man from what I was when I was
</p>
<p>covered with the homely stuff. But to return to the statement.
</p>
<p>After having read from those speeches^ and those placards, the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General then told you he had come to the facts of the case.
</p>
<p>He came down to the period at which this Association was estab-
</p>
<p>lished, and then he proceeds to read for you the different speeches
</p>
<p>and publications which he says were overt acts of this conspiracy. He
</p>
<p>was reading those for many hours; he read for you amongst the rest,
</p>
<p>a scrap of poetry, very treasonable poetry, as he would suggest, " The
</p>
<p>Memory of the Dead," reminding people of the year '98. I wonder,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, when he was commenting on that little morceau, I wonder
</p>
<p>it never struck him to recollect " The Exile of Frin." Now, what is
</p>
<p>407
</p>
<p>that little piece of poetry ? What is it but an expression of pity and
</p>
<p>commiseration, and respect towards those who perished in that fran-
</p>
<p>tic strussle, telling: those who may be the relatives of the unfortunate
</p>
<p>Do 7 O J 1 i l / 1 *
</p>
<p>persons that so perished, that there was no reason to blush tor their
</p>
<p>kindred with those unhappy, misguided men, no doubt concluding
</p>
<p>with the chorus :
</p>
<p>" You, men, will be true men, and remember '98."
</p>
<p>I do not know whether it was expected by the repetition of those
</p>
<p>lines, Gentlemen, that you men should be true men, and that you
</p>
<p>should remember '98. And that you should remember '98 against
</p>
<p>those of the traversers that stood the test of '98 ; that were loyal in
</p>
<p>'98 ; that were loyal even since '98, and that you men should be
</p>
<p>true men and remember '98 against those that were not born in '98.
</p>
<p>I own, to my imagination, that morceau, when read, brought that
</p>
<p>idea very strongly, and it made me apprehend that it was at least
</p>
<p>expected that your verdict could be influenced against those gentle-
</p>
<p>men by exciting your prejudices and inflaming your passions with a
</p>
<p>recollection of that unfortunate period.
</p>
<p>But now, Gentlemen, how am 1 to deal with the numerous
</p>
<p>and prolix speeches and publications which have been read to you
</p>
<p>both in statement and in evidence ? Am I to take them up one
</p>
<p>by one and read them over again, and add my commentary on
</p>
<p>each as I read it? This would plainly be an endless task, and if
</p>
<p>I can avoid a course so calculated to weary you I am bound to
</p>
<p>do so. You are not here trying the legality or illegality of any
</p>
<p>one, nor of all these speeches and publications. The traversers are
</p>
<p>not indicted for sedition, and the criminality of any speech or pub-
</p>
<p>lication comes only incidentally into question. If to speak any
</p>
<p>particular speech was the commission of crime, then you have to
</p>
<p>inquire whether the defendants, or any two or more of them, con-
</p>
<p>spired to concoct and deliver that speech. These are the two ques-
</p>
<p>tions and the only questions which you have to ask in relation to each
</p>
<p>and every of the speeches and publications which have been read to you.

</p>
<p>and therefore I shall endeavour to deal with the case, by making- ge-
</p>
<p>neral observations on all the publications read against the traversers.
</p>
<p>The past has been referred to in many of their speeches and publica-
</p>
<p>tions, and referred to in terms which the Attorney-General would
</p>
<p>have you to suppose were intended to excite a spirit and feeling of
</p>
<p>revenge in the living towards the living, on account of the supposed
</p>
<p>wrongs inflicted by the past generations on those who are long since
</p>
<p>dead. This is the construction which the Attorney-General puts on
</p>
<p>the language used by the traversers. That the past has been referred
</p>
<p>to in terms not very cautious, is not to be denied, but still in terms
</p>
<p>not very likely to be adopted by men who had crime in their hearts,
</p>
<p>or by men seeking to excite civil wars, and pursuing their object as
</p>
<p>conspirators, by men engaged in an atrocious attempt to stimulate the
</p>
<p>inhabitants of this country at the present day to civil war  a design
</p>
<p>which they dare not openly avow. That they did use this language,
</p>
<p>plainly condemning, and holding up to execration as they did, the
</p>
<p>cruelties of by-gone times, to my mind carries much conviction that,
</p>
<p>408
</p>
<p>in so doing, they had no criminal intent whatever. That they act-
</p>
<p>ed openly, and plainly, and unreservedly, is to me proof that they
</p>
<p>were not conscious of any criminal intent. Now, let us for a mi-
</p>
<p>nute contemplate the means by which this Repeal of the Union
</p>
<p>was to be carried ; and if I mistake not, we shall be able to ac-
</p>
<p>count for the many references made to the past cruelties of the
</p>
<p>reigning party without ascribing them to the desire of stimula-
</p>
<p>ting the present generation to outrage. Before we come to details
</p>
<p>it is but right to have regard to the period, to the time, and to
</p>
<p>the circumstances, under which this agitation has been got up. We
</p>
<p>should remark, that in modern days, public opinion has attained a
</p>
<p>strength wholly unknown to it in ancient times. Why ? what is the
</p>
<p>cause of this new force of public opinion ? The cause of it is this :
</p>
<p>the rapid communication between the several countries on the face
</p>
<p>of the earth, the rapid communication of thought by which the whole
</p>
<p>human race has been, as it were, converted into a single country, nay,
</p>
<p>into a single family, in which no individual can stir in any public
</p>
<p>matter without being under the view and subject to the opinion of all.
</p>
<p>He must be but a poor observer of human events who does not per-
</p>
<p>ceive how irresistible is the power, even upon whole nations, of public
</p>
<p>opinion in the present day, when this rapid communication and this
</p>
<p>power of the Press bring the attention of the whole human race,
</p>
<p>almost in a moment of time, on the actions of men and of nations ; the
</p>
<p>Press and rapid communications are two modern engines, and they
</p>
<p>are proceeding to put out of the world altogether, and I hope they will,
</p>
<p>the use of brute physical force. War is becoming daily less likely to
</p>
<p>occur, and why ? because the conduct of a nation becomes like the con-
</p>
<p>duct of an individual, subject to the control of public opinion, and it is
</p>
<p>brought under view for the reprehension or the praise of all other
</p>
<p>nations. It is brought under that principle adverted to by Locke,
</p>
<p>when he asserts that men who disregard both Divine law and civil
</p>
<p>law are yet coerced to obey the law of opinion. And hence it is
</p>
<p>that physical war is ultimately likely to give place altogether to the
</p>
<p>force of a much stronger engine, namely the public opinion of the

</p>
<p>human race. Before that rapid communication of thought existed 
</p>
<p>before the power of the press existed  nations were hardly amen-
</p>
<p>able at all to the force of opinion ; for other nations could know
</p>
<p>nothing of their acts until they were stale and half forgotten. In
</p>
<p>fact nations could not be considered at all before the Forum of opi-
</p>
<p>nion ; that is not the case now ; and if you will only carry in your
</p>
<p>minds this suggestion of mine, I think it will explain much of the matter
</p>
<p>that has been read to you, without leading you to the conclusion of
</p>
<p>guilt against the traversers. Do you recollect the sentiment so often
</p>
<p>repeated in all the speeches of Mr. O'Connell? Do you remember
</p>
<p>the words, "We want your sympathy  we do not want your phy-
</p>
<p>sical force." " Ours shall be a revolution not accomplished by blood."
</p>
<p>" Ours is to be a revolution to be accomplished by peaceful means ;
</p>
<p>" Repeal is to be procured by legal, peaceful, and constitutional means;
</p>
<p>" ours shall be a bloodless revolution." Again, he has repeatedly said :
</p>
<p>" Ours shall be a proceeding free from force, violence, or crime of any
</p>
<p>409
</p>
<p>" kind. We seek to attain that object by peaceable means, by legal
</p>
<p>" means, by constitutional, by innocent means." How were they to at-
</p>
<p>tain it ? By exhibiting to the whole human family the sufferings of this
</p>
<p>particular nation ; by showing them a nation peaceable, united, intel-
</p>
<p>ligent, moral, religious, and yet ground to the very earth by op-
</p>
<p>pression. A population able to work and willing to work, yet starv-
</p>
<p>ing for want of employment. Is Ireland in a state it ought to con-
</p>
<p>tinue in? Whether the Repeal of the Union would cure the woes
</p>
<p>of Ireland, I do not feel myself competent to say, neither do I feel
</p>
<p>myself competent to form an opinion ; but this 1 do feel myself
</p>
<p>competent to form an opinion on, that a state of things should not
</p>
<p>be suffered to continue, in which we see an active and an able-
</p>
<p>bodied population, desirous of employment, and willing to work for
</p>
<p>the smallest amount of wages that can be measured, inhabiting a ter-
</p>
<p>ritory waste and wild, and yet susceptible of the highest cultivation,
</p>
<p>and capable of making a return of tenfold for every day's labour
</p>
<p>bestowed upon it, yet that territory is allowed to lie a squalid and
</p>
<p>dreary waste, but still less squalid, still less hideous than the human ha-
</p>
<p>bitations and the human beings by which it is deformed, not cheered.
</p>
<p>Travel through the South and West of Ireland, and in all parts
</p>
<p>you will see wastes of many miles, further than the eye can reach,
</p>
<p>of improveable land that has been there sleeping, perfectly inert and
</p>
<p>useless to the human race for centuries ; you will see that waste,
</p>
<p>that wild, and wretched, and dreary tract of wilderness, here and
</p>
<p>there not ornamented but deformed by human habitations, that are
</p>
<p>not as comfortable as the habitations of the common brute in other
</p>
<p>lands ; when I see this population starving and miserable, but yet
</p>
<p>strong and intelligent ; when I see human beings squalid and de-
</p>
<p>graded, obliged to subsist on the most wretched food, having neither
</p>
<p>shelter, nor clothing, nor comfort of any kind ; when I see a popu-
</p>
<p>lation such as that, and in that condition, I ask myself, is this a state
</p>
<p>of things that ought to be ? When I see thousands, nay millions of
</p>
<p>men starving, yet willing to give their labour for the paltry sum
</p>
<p>of sixpence a day, and living upon land that would yield a return of

<p>five shillings for the sixpence, I ask myself, is that a state of things
</p>
<p>which ought to exist, or, if it exists, which ought to continue? Does
</p>
<p>that state of things exist? If that exists, if it ought not to continue, is
</p>
<p>any man to be branded, or are any set of men to be branded by the foul
</p>
<p>epithet of conspirators, for thinking, no matter how erroneously, that a
</p>
<p>certain law upon the Statute Book, which is now of forty-four years'
</p>
<p>standing, is the cause of that human wretchedness, and that the repeal of
</p>
<p>this law would put an end to this crying wretchedness ? Are men who
</p>
<p>advocate the repeal of that Statute, and seek to make proselytes to
</p>
<p>their opinions to be branded by the foul name of conspirators ? All
</p>
<p>the gentlemen who represent this country in Parliament reside perma-
</p>
<p>nently in London ; they draw after them all in their own rank who
</p>
<p>may have some interest to prosecute at Court. And it is plain that
</p>
<p>all this, at least, is occasioned by the Union. To say, therefore, that
</p>
<p>men who believe this law to be the cause of the evil, are not to ex-
</p>
<p>press an opinion against that law  are not to unite against that law 
</p>
<p>3g
</p>
<p>410
</p>
<p>without being branded as conspirators, seems to me monstrous and
</p>
<p>absurd. Yet this is the conclusion which you are called on to come
</p>
<p>to by this prosecution ! I am no Repealer. No man ever heard me
</p>
<p>say, privately or publicly, that I desired a repeal of that Statute ;
</p>
<p>in truth, I have never considered the question much, for this
</p>
<p>plain reason, that I thought it useless to do so ; but let any
</p>
<p>man convince me to-morrow that the repeal of that Statute
</p>
<p>would raise this unfortunate country from this most deplorable
</p>
<p>condition, and I would be a Repealer. I will not shrink from
</p>
<p>saying that if once I am convinced that this Statute is the cause
</p>
<p>of that misery, I would henceforth pursue the repeal of it even
</p>
<p>to the death. That is going as far as any of those men have gone.
</p>
<p>But I hope no man will imagine that I would pursue the repeal of
</p>
<p>that Statute by the commission of crime. Gentlemen, I hope that
</p>
<p>there are many, many thousands, and I hope that the traversers are
</p>
<p>men who although they would die to repeal that Statute, would
</p>
<p>sooner die fifty deaths than repeal it by committing the crime of
</p>
<p>conspiracy. See what you are called upon to do. Because men
</p>
<p>have considered that the Repeal of the Union would be the re-
</p>
<p>generation of Ireland from that state of wretchedness, in which it
</p>
<p>confessedly exists  because they endeavour to persuade others by
</p>
<p>warm language to be of their opinion, therefore you are called upon to
</p>
<p>say that they are guilty of a foul and treacherous conspiracy.
</p>
<p>What is conspiracy in its proper sense? Is it just to say that it
</p>
<p>means concert, that it means agreement or coincidence of opinion ? It
</p>
<p>means no such thing. The essence of the crime is treachery. It is in
</p>
<p>its treachery the danger and the importance of the crime consists.
</p>
<p>When men put their heads and wits together intending to commit
</p>
<p>crime against their neighbours who are ignorant of this combination, and
</p>
<p>therefore who are not on their guard ; who may, therefore, be taken
</p>
<p>by surprise, such combination to commit crime is properly called
</p>
<p>conspiracy. Treachery thus, necessarily ex vi termini, and secrecy
</p>
<p>also, are included in the word conspiracy. There never was such an
</p>
<p>abuse of language as that which asserts that conspiracy means concert

<p>or agreement, or combination to do an illegal act, or, in their alterna-
</p>
<p>tive, to do a legal act by illegal means. In the complicated state of
</p>
<p>the laws of this country, is it to be said that a man who has an ob-
</p>
<p>ject in view is a conspirator, if it should eventually turn out that this
</p>
<p>object was illegal ? Suppose a man claims the estate that is in your
</p>
<p>possession, thinking he is legally entitled to it, though he is not, and
</p>
<p>confers with his friends how to recover it, is he, therefore, a conspi-
</p>
<p>rator ? Conspiracy imports crime, crime of the deepest die. It
</p>
<p>means that persons have a criminal object in view, knowing it to be
</p>
<p>criminal ; or, if they are pursuing a legal object, knowing that the
</p>
<p>means which they intend to employ are criminal. See how that is il-
</p>
<p>lustrated by the cases that are decided. Those who bribed the assis-
</p>
<p>tant of the cardmaker were guilty of this crime. Is that like the case
</p>
<p>now brought before you ? Certainly not. It is utterly impossible to
</p>
<p>say so. Gentlemen, the law of this country never sanctioned the ap-
</p>
<p>plication of the law of conspiracy to such a case as this. In the case
</p>
<p>411
</p>
<p>of Rex v. Bird, reported in 25 St. Tr. the traversers were accused
</p>
<p>of conspiring to excite insurrection in this country, and to bring in
</p>
<p>foreign forces here ; and, strange to say, although it is quite plain
</p>
<p>that such a conspiracy as that would be treason, yet they were not
</p>
<p>indicted for that, but for misdemeanor. In that case witnesses were
</p>
<p>produced, who alleged that they themselves aided the three men
</p>
<p>who were on trial; the case broke down on the credibility of the
</p>
<p>witnesses, who swore to a clear case of treason, but who were disbe-
</p>
<p>lieved, and there was an acquittal. Having failed, in that prosecu-
</p>
<p>tion, to turn a charge of treason into a misdemeanor, of which a
</p>
<p>jury might be found more easily to convict, and having failed in the
</p>
<p>case of Hardy and Tooke, as I told you before, to establish con-
</p>
<p>structive treason, the Government turned their attention to a person
</p>
<p>named Yorke, commonly called Redhead. His case is reported in
</p>
<p>the same volume, and they prosecuted him for a conspiracy and mis-
</p>
<p>demeanor, a conspiracy for being a member of the societies, a con-
</p>
<p>nexion with which they had sought to establish, as treason, against
</p>
<p>Hardy and Tooke. Yorke was convicted, having been badly defend-
</p>
<p>ed by himself, and being prosecuted by all the weight and influence
</p>
<p>of the Government, by which he was borne down, and borne down
</p>
<p>unjustly, and against law. That was in the year 1795, the year after the
</p>
<p>prosecution for treason, in the case of Hardy and Tooke, had wholly
</p>
<p>failed and broken down. Yorke was tried for the same facts which had
</p>
<p>been proved against Hardy, Tooke, and others. That case of York,
</p>
<p>so far as I can learn, never has been brought into precedent, and I do
</p>
<p>not think any lawyer reading the report can say it was a constitu-
</p>
<p>tional or proper conviction. Yorke, however, was convicted, and
</p>
<p>sentenced to two years' imprisonment, and here the case rested.
</p>
<p>At that time, when the Government of that day instituted this pro-
</p>
<p>secution against Yorke, they not only failed in their attempt to esta-
</p>
<p>blish a case of constructive treason, upon the same facts, against men
</p>
<p>who were ably defended, but they also failed in the attempt, the per-
</p>
<p>severing attempt, to establish a precedent for turning a case of treason
</p>
<p>into the lessrevoltingoffenceof misdemeanor,which would have answer-

</p>
<p>ed their purpose as well in point of punishment and would have made it
</p>
<p>easier to get conviction. The law of libel, from the time Lord Mansfield
</p>
<p>first came to the Bench, in 1756, was a source of great controversy
</p>
<p>between the people and the Government. Persevering efforts were
</p>
<p>made to establish a ministerial scourge in this crime of libel. The
</p>
<p>doctrine propounded by the State lawyers, and finally adopted by the
</p>
<p>Bench, was that the mere fact of publication constituted the only
</p>
<p>question for the jury, and that the jury had nothing to do with any-
</p>
<p>thing else except the bare fact of publication, and when called on to
</p>
<p>find a verdict where a person was accused of having published a libel
</p>
<p>on the Government, the jury were not to consider the matter of that
</p>
<p>libel at all, but nierely the fact of publication, and Lord Mansfield
</p>
<p>decided that as the law in the case of Rex v , noticed afterwards
</p>
<p>by himself 3 Term R. 430; but it came more directly before him in
</p>
<p>the case of Wood/all, who was prosecuted for publishing Junius's
</p>
<p>412
</p>
<p>Letters. These letters contained remarkable and pointed allusions
</p>
<p>to the physical force of the people, and in plain terms, threatened not
</p>
<p>only the King's ministers with it, but the King himself. Woodfall
</p>
<p>was prosecuted, and Lord Mansfield told the jury they had nothing
</p>
<p>to do with any question except that of mere publication, and they
</p>
<p>found a verdict accordingly, but a verdict which frustrated the inten-
</p>
<p>tions of the Chief Justice. They found that Woodfall was "guilty of
</p>
<p>the printing and publishing onljj." The case came before the full
</p>
<p>Court, and the Court ordered a new trial, holding that the insertion
</p>
<p>of the word only made it such a verdict as could not be acted upon ;
</p>
<p>a new trial was ordered, but never was had, because the Crown at
</p>
<p>the former trial had lost the manuscript. The same thing occurred four-
</p>
<p>teen years after in the case of the Dean of St. Asaph, who was prose-
</p>
<p>cuted for a political libel ; he was defended, and most ably defended by
</p>
<p>Mr. Erskine, and the jury in his case brought in a verdict in nearly the
</p>
<p>same terms as in the case of Woodfall, and there arose between Mr. Jus-
</p>
<p>tice Buller, who tried the case, and Mr. Erskine, a very warm contest,
</p>
<p>in the course of which the Judge threatened to commit Mr. Erskine
</p>
<p>to gaol. Mr. Erskine, however, stood firm. He stood (and he declared
</p>
<p>that he felt it) on the very bulwark of the Constitution, and he would
</p>
<p>not readily resign the benefits of freedom which he enjoyed himself,
</p>
<p>and which he hoped to see transmitted to posterity. The verdict in
</p>
<p>that case was, that the publication was proved, but they did not find
</p>
<p>whether it was a libel or not. Again, the case by motion came be-
</p>
<p>fore the Court, and the Court affirmed its own law, and refused to
</p>
<p>set aside the verdict. In the year 1789, again the same question
</p>
<p>was raised in the case of Hex v. JJ r ithers, and Lord Kenyon affirmed
</p>
<p>the same doctrine. It was then too late to expect that the law would
</p>
<p>ever be corrected by the Judges. The question of determining upon
</p>
<p>the guilt or innocence of accused parties in the case of libel was taken
</p>
<p>entirely out of the hands of the jury, and the determination of that
</p>
<p>question was assumed by the Judges, contrary to every principle of
</p>
<p>British law. The minister had then in his hands that scourge which
</p>
<p>he had been so long looking for. But against this usurpation at length

</p>
<p>common sense prevailed, and the community asserted its privileges in
</p>
<p>Parliament, through its representatives : and the Parliament, not con-
</p>
<p>sisting of lawyers or judges, passed an Act in 1792, declaring that
</p>
<p>what the Judges had established was not the law, and again restoring
</p>
<p>to the jury the privilege of deciding on the guilt or innocence of the
</p>
<p>defendant in cases of libel as in all other cases, and thus restored to
</p>
<p>the jury the jurisdiction to try the mind and the motive of the party
</p>
<p>accused, as a right peculiarly belonging to them, and refusing to the
</p>
<p>Judges anything more than a right to express their opinion, as in
</p>
<p>other cases. Gentlemen, the last prosecution that I am aware of, of
</p>
<p>any great public a oment, for the crime of libel, the last State prose-
</p>
<p>cution for libel after that law was passed, was the case of Rex
</p>
<p>v. Hone, in 1817. Hone had published parodies on the Lord's
</p>
<p>Prayer, the Creed, and the Litany. He was prosecuted by the At-
</p>
<p>torney-General of that day, on three distinct and several indictments,
</p>
<p>and he was tried and acquitted on three several days, by three seve-
</p>
<p>413
</p>
<p>ral juries, against the opinions of Lord Ellenborough and Justice
</p>
<p>Abbott. A sensible English jury determined they would not find a
</p>
<p>man guilty where guilt was not, and that they would not, because a
</p>
<p>case was brought into Court with all the weight of the Crown and in-
</p>
<p>fluence of the Government, surrender those rights which they
</p>
<p>inherited themselves, and which they hoped to transmit to those who
</p>
<p>should come after them.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, there never was in England nor in Ire-
</p>
<p>land any one case which at all comes near the present in point of
</p>
<p>public interest and public importance. I have no hesitation in de-
</p>
<p>claring that this is a plain, open, undisguised proceeding to place
</p>
<p>the law of conspiracy upon such a footing that it will be a complete
</p>
<p>press and instrument in the hands of whoever may chance to be the
</p>
<p>minister of the day to crush the legitimate expression of popular
</p>
<p>feeling, and to silence free discussions upon all political topics. Mark
</p>
<p>the course of the proceedings in the present case. There is no
</p>
<p>count in the indictment for attending illegal meetings or any other
</p>
<p>crime, but that of conspiracy ; a conspiracy to hold meetings for the
</p>
<p>purpose of petitioning the Legislature for the repeal of an Act of
</p>
<p>Parliament, and by the exhibition of physical force at these meetings
</p>
<p>to overawe the Legislature. If the meetings were illegal, why was
</p>
<p>there not a count in the indictment for attending those illegal meet-
</p>
<p>ings ? If the speeches which were delivered at the meetings were
</p>
<p>seditious, why have we not a count in the indictment for uttering
</p>
<p>seditious language ? If it be a crime to conspire for the purpose of
</p>
<p>calling a meeting, and of extorting from Parliament alterations in
</p>
<p>the law by the exhibition of physical force, why not have a count in
</p>
<p>the indictment for making such exhibition of physical force ? Why
</p>
<p>omit all these counts ? For this manifest reason, because they feared
</p>
<p>lest the jury in the present case, as in Hunt's, might find a verdict of
</p>
<p>not guilty on the count for conspiracy, and of guilty upon some other
</p>
<p>counts. Those other counts were omitted, and the whole indict-
</p>
<p>ment was perilled on the single charge of conspiracy, because they
</p>
<p>hoped that by management, or by some accident, it might so happen

</p>
<p>that twelve anti-Repealers, twelve men of their own party, might get
</p>
<p>into the jury-box, and the Crown knew that it would be a very con-
</p>
<p>venient dilemma to bring those twelve gentlemen into either to ac-
</p>
<p>quit the traversers, their political adversaries, or else find a verdict
</p>
<p>of guilty on the charge of conspiracy, there being no other charge
</p>
<p>in the indictment upon which they could be found guilty.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, this is a case which it behoves you to approach with
</p>
<p>minds calm, unprejudiced, and dispassionate. Great is the trust
</p>
<p>that has been reposed in you  momentous, indeed, is the task
</p>
<p>which has devolved upon you. I tell you, Gentlemen, you are
</p>
<p>here acting as the guardians of the Constitution which you have
</p>
<p>received from your forefathers as your noblest inheritance ; you
</p>
<p>are here acting as guardians of that law, by which rational liberty
</p>
<p>is either now to be secured, or must leave your country for ever ;
</p>
<p>you are here in charge of, and defending the very citadel of li-
</p>
<p>berty ; do not suffer yourselves to be deluded into the supposition
</p>
<p>414
</p>
<p>that it is the traversers alone who are to suffer by, and who are inte-
</p>
<p>rested in the result of your verdict. You are each of you interested
</p>
<p>in this case, for the fortunes of your country are involved. Do not
</p>
<p>for a moment suppose that I tear that any one gentleman of the
</p>
<p>twelve whom I am addressing, is not as upright a man as any that can
</p>
<p>be found in society, or that he would not discharge his duty in this
</p>
<p>case with firmness of purpose and unswerving determination. The
</p>
<p>Attorney-General read for you in the course of his address, a very
</p>
<p>impressive passage from a charge of the late Lord Chief Justice, de-
</p>
<p>livered at a special commission in Maryborough. I do not think it
</p>
<p>was fair to press that passage into this case. That language of the
</p>
<p>late Chief Justice was used on a very different occasion, and applied
</p>
<p>to a wholly different class of persons from those to which the At-
</p>
<p>torney-General would now apply it. That address was delivered at
</p>
<p>a special commission appointed for the trial of nightly incendiaries and
</p>
<p>murderers ; that was a strong exhortation to the Grand Jury under
</p>
<p>very peculiar circumstances, when there was reason to apprehend that
</p>
<p>the terrors held out by the assassin and the incendiary, might scare
</p>
<p>them from the performance of their duty. In the commencement of
</p>
<p>his charge, the late Lord Chief Justice drew the attention of the
</p>
<p>Grand Jury to the vast numbers of murders and atrocious incendiary
</p>
<p>offences which had taken place in the Queen's County during the
</p>
<p>brief space of two months, and he deemed it expedient to impress
</p>
<p>upon the jurors the necessity of performing their duty with firmness
</p>
<p>and decision, for he knew he was addressing a body of men who lived
</p>
<p>in the midst of those desperate and reckless characters by whom the
</p>
<p>dreadful deeds had been committed which had created the necessity for
</p>
<p>the special commission. Under these circumstances it was proper and
</p>
<p>Justin that, able and constitutional judge to tell the Grand Jury, in
</p>
<p>emphatic language, that those associated crimes (the crimes of which
</p>
<p>he was speaking  the crimes of nightly burnings and nightly murders)
</p>
<p>must be met vigorously by the strong arm of the law; but, Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, you must not lose sight of that fact, this the language quoted by
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General was not spoken of any individval on his trial-

</p>
<p>was not addressed to a jury sworn to try whether any accused par-
</p>
<p>ties were Or were not guilty of the crime imputed to them. That
</p>
<p>language was used before any man was indicted as a criminal  before
</p>
<p>any man was placed upon his trial, and when the only duty of a jury
</p>
<p>was to decide, not whether A. B. was or was not guilty, but whether
</p>
<p>the persons then in gaol should be placed on trial  whether the bills of
</p>
<p>indictment which should be preferred against them ought to be received
</p>
<p>as true bills or ignored. If that ever-to-be-remembered Judge had used
</p>
<p>such language in addressing a Petty Jury before whom a prisoner
</p>
<p>had been arraigned, and in reference to that prisoner's case, it would
</p>
<p>have been an eternal blot on his memory as a Judge. It would be a
</p>
<p>blot on his memory as a Judge and as a man, if he had done so. Is
</p>
<p>it justifiable in the Attorney General to borrow the language of that
</p>
<p>distinguished Judge, thus addressed to a Grand Jury concerning in-
</p>
<p>cendiaries and murderers, and to apply it to this case, where these
</p>
<p>gentlemen are on their trial for the state offence of conspiracy?
</p>
<p>415
</p>
<p>What, may I ask, would be the feelings of that Chief Justice, if he
</p>
<p>were here at this moment, to witness the application of the language
</p>
<p>which he used in the case of assassins and murderers, to his brother-
</p>
<p>barrister of forty years' standing? Oh, that he were here to witness !
</p>
<p>How would that Lord Chief Justice express his indignation at this
</p>
<p>foul misapplication of his language to his friend and to his eulogist,
</p>
<p>in the case where they were most violently opposed to each other ?
</p>
<p>Oh, but he would not recognize Mr. O'Connell as his friend, in his
</p>
<p>present position. They belie his memory who think so. He would,
</p>
<p>although he stands at that bar, call him his friend, and would protect
</p>
<p>him from such injustice as is done him by this misapplication of what
</p>
<p>was never intended for such a man. Why did the Attorney General
</p>
<p>not address you in his own language? Why did he adopt the lan-
</p>
<p>guage of a great man, and seek to affect the defendants by the autho-
</p>
<p>rity of the late Chief Justice, as well as by his eloquence? Had
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General addressed you in language of his own inven-
</p>
<p>tion, the style would suit both the occasion and the speaker, and we
</p>
<p>should have a proof that he who could, on such an occasion, mis-
</p>
<p>apply such eloquent language, could not invent it. No, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>he addressed you in the language of Lord Chief Justice Bushe, in
</p>
<p>order to prejudice the case of the traversers, and to impress your
</p>
<p>minds with the notion that these were associated criminals like those
</p>
<p>to whom the late Chief Justice alluded. The Attorney-General
</p>
<p>had open to him the plain and simple course of stating and com-
</p>
<p>menting on the facts of the case before you. Why not follow that
</p>
<p>course, and why warp and misapply to this case the eloquent com-
</p>
<p>mentary which was made upon a totally different description of crime,
</p>
<p>and on a totally different class of men ? The charge here is simply
</p>
<p>this, that the defendants conspired together. If any conspiracy
</p>
<p>existed, the proof of its existence must be simple, and why not
</p>
<p>simply state the proofs and afterwards simply prove the facts demon-
</p>
<p>strating the existence of the alleged conspiracy. If the guilt existed
</p>
<p>the proof of it could not require a statement of eleven hours, and
</p>
<p>evidence occupying seven or eight days. A case of clear guilt never

</p>
<p>could be so bewildered and involved in chaos and confusion as this
</p>
<p>case now stands before you. How, I again ask, am I to deal with
</p>
<p>the numberless speeches, publications, and documents which have
</p>
<p>been already partially read to you ? Am I to begin them and read
</p>
<p>them, and comment on them one by one ? Were I to do this,
</p>
<p>when would the case terminate ? Were I to take up, for instance,
</p>
<p>the speech of Dr. Gray, my client, delivered at Mullaghmast, and
</p>
<p>comment upon it, and, as I read it, point out to you that although a
</p>
<p>warm speech it was yet not a treasonable or a seditious speech, al-
</p>
<p>though I should succeed in convincing you that there was nothino-
</p>
<p>criminal in that speech, I should yet not have advanced one step in
</p>
<p>the defence. I should be told that Dr. Gray was not charged either
</p>
<p>with treason or sedition, and that his speech was read against him only
</p>
<p>as evidence of his concurrence with the other conspirators in advancing
</p>
<p>their common object. After reading, analyzing, and defending that
</p>
<p>speech, and proving it innocent from beginning to end, I should at the
</p>
<p>416
</p>
<p>conclusion have but cut offone head of the Hydra. Every other speech
</p>
<p>of every other of the traversers, nay, of every member of the Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation, and every word either written or spoken by any one of them,
</p>
<p>is equally evidence against Dr. Gray, as what he published or spoke
</p>
<p>himself. Such is this doctrine of conspiracy. I should therefore
</p>
<p>read, analyze, and justify every other speech and publication, as well
</p>
<p>as his own, a task to be performed scarcely by Hercules himself. To
</p>
<p>attempt this would be useless, and worse than useless. The course
</p>
<p>pursued in reading the publications to you by the Crown, is in other
</p>
<p>respects also calculated to prejudice the defendants. They selected
</p>
<p>from each, the passages best calculated to prejudice the traversers,
</p>
<p>and to support the charge of sedition, and those passages were read in
</p>
<p>rapid and unbroken succession, so as to make a deep impression upon
</p>
<p>you, which nothing could afterwards efface. Thus, by extracting the
</p>
<p>poison from a great number of documents, an effect is produced
</p>
<p>which would not follow from reading the whole of each speech or
</p>
<p>publication. Thus from the very bread of life deadly poison may
</p>
<p>be extracted, destructive if taken by itself, but not only innocent,
</p>
<p>but salutary, if taken in combination with that from which it was
</p>
<p>extracted. When they thus read for you in succession those many
</p>
<p>passages containing strong, warm, and passionate declamation of Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell, they omitted to read what the same gentleman had many
</p>
<p>times, and over and over again spoken of a completely opposite ten-
</p>
<p>dency. I shall shew that if you are to judge of Mr. O'ConnelPs motives
</p>
<p>from his public speeches, and to decide whether he was a conspi-
</p>
<p>rator against the peace and happiness of his country, you must come
</p>
<p>to such a conclusion in the total disregard of the sentiments one
</p>
<p>thousand times expressed and warmly inculcated by him. I will
</p>
<p>venture to say that I shall read for you such passages, as that every
</p>
<p>man of you will feel himself by them warmly prompted to the fulfil-
</p>
<p>ment and discharge of every moral, religious, and political duty.
</p>
<p>Is it then fair that he should be tried and condemned, not by the fair
</p>
<p>tenor of all his public language, but by passages selected from that
</p>
<p>immense mass of thought, as Mr. Shed has called it, which he

</p>
<p>has poured forth during the last three or four years  and that he
</p>
<p>should be judged by those selected passages, spoken in warmth, with
</p>
<p>the incaution of conscious rectitude of purpose,  and that those
</p>
<p>chosen passages should now be brought in review before you, to
</p>
<p>excite your passions, and rouse your prejudices ?
</p>
<p>WEDNESDAY, January 31st.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon.  Gentlemen, the magnitude of this case, and its
</p>
<p>importance to the client who has placed me here to defend him, ab-
</p>
<p>solutely requires that I should stand up upon this the morning of
</p>
<p>the second day to address you. I hope no man will ascribe the
</p>
<p>fault to me. That I should not have, the power, in a speech of
</p>
<p>some two, or three, or four, or five, or six, or seven hours, to digest this
</p>
<p>417
</p>
<p>mass of matter which has been confusedly thrown down before you with-
</p>
<p>out explanation  that I should not have the faculty, in a short speech,
</p>
<p>to make that mass intelligible to you, and bring before you other matter
</p>
<p>calculated to explain, and neutralize, and render innocent much of
</p>
<p>what you have heard in the shape of crimination is not my fault; it
</p>
<p>may be my misfortune. I may, perhaps, be entirely de6cient in the
</p>
<p>faculty of condensation. I can deal with a case, I confess, only in
</p>
<p>detail. I hope I don't stand in a wrong position with the Court in
</p>
<p>not concluding yesterday, and not doing so to have broken any implied
</p>
<p>promise to the Court.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  Don't imagine any such thing: the
</p>
<p>Court has no thought of the kind.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon.  I have a duty to perform, and in reference to
</p>
<p>my own peace of mind, I must perform it, no matter what time I may
</p>
<p>take to do it. I stand here for only one of the traversers, technically
</p>
<p>speaking, for Dr. Gray, but in effect I speak for all. He, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>is a young man, and belongs to a respectable and learned Profession ;
</p>
<p>as respectable, as useful, and as honourable a Profession as that to
</p>
<p>which I have the honour myself to belong. He is a young man in
</p>
<p>the beginning of life ; he is part proprietor of a newspaper of, per-
</p>
<p>haps, the oldest standing of any in your city  a newspaper that has
</p>
<p>preserved an unimpeached character for moral and political integrity,
</p>
<p>and a high character for ability, for half a century in your city. I,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, have to defend him from a charge of conspiracy, for
</p>
<p>having been taken with the eloquence, the ability, and what he be-
</p>
<p>lieved to be the true and honest patriotism of a man whose tongue
</p>
<p>scarcely ever failed to seduce to his opinion any one that would only
</p>
<p>have the patience to hear him. That is Dr. Gray's sin and crime, if
</p>
<p>you will : and, Gentlemen, in defending him from the imputation of this
</p>
<p>crime  of having been led or misled, if you will, it becomes essentially
</p>
<p>necessary for me to bring before you the passages of the eloquence of
</p>
<p>the gentleman who so seduced my client into this Association, and
</p>
<p>which have not yet been read to you, and which are eminently calcu-
</p>
<p>lated, in my humble opinion, not only to exonerate from guilt the

</p>
<p>man that lent his ear to those speeches, but to exonerate every other
</p>
<p>man belonging to this Association, including the first of the traversers,
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell himself.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I said to you, that ingenuity had been exercised
</p>
<p>in selecting passages from the speeches of Mr. O'Connell, and read-
</p>
<p>ing them in rapid succession to you, to induce you to believe that
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell's agitation had for its object a final termination in
</p>
<p>an insurrection in this country ; that, although he had peace upon
</p>
<p>his tongue, he had sedition and rebellion in his heart ; and let them
</p>
<p>disguise it as they please, that has been their imputation here. Let
</p>
<p>me call your attention to what, in my judgment, appears to be the
</p>
<p>very strongest passage they have read to you from the speeches of Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell as leading to such a conclusion. I take up the speech of
</p>
<p>the 11th of June last, at Mallow. Give me again your attention to
</p>
<p>this portion of his speech. I will read to you the worst parts of it, and
</p>
<p>3H
</p>
<p>418
</p>
<p>leaving out the intermediate passages, as the Crown have done, and shall
</p>
<p>read those passages in the very order in which they have stated them.
</p>
<p>He says : " I never felt such a loathing for speechifying as at the pre-
</p>
<p>sent time." They would make you believe that he meant he would
</p>
<p>no longer be talking, but doing  and doing what? That he was about
</p>
<p>to take arms and rise in insurrection. That is their interpretation of
</p>
<p>these words. Let them disguise it as they please, that is what they
</p>
<p>mean to impute. Do they believe that themselves ? I ask, did the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General believe that when he framed this indictment? If
</p>
<p>he did, why shrink from his duty ? Why did he not indict for high
</p>
<p>treason ? If he expected that any twelve honest men on their oaths
</p>
<p>could believe that, why did he stop short of what it was his duty to do ?
</p>
<p>If those speeches were expressive of that intent, the crime of high
</p>
<p>treason was perpetrated ; and why did he not indict for high treason ?
</p>
<p>He goes on : " They may take the alternative, to live as slaves or
</p>
<p>die as freemen." Again they would have you believe that by that
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell intended to suggest to his hearers, that if they did not
</p>
<p>choose to live as slaves, they should take up arms and die in the field
</p>
<p>of battle as freemen  die on the field of battle fighting against their
</p>
<p>own countrymen in civil war; that is the meaning they want to in-
</p>
<p>sinuate to you. Is that the meaning of Mr. O'Connell? Again I
</p>
<p>ask them if they believed that to be the meaning themselves, and had
</p>
<p>the most remote expectation of inducing others to believe it?  If they
</p>
<p>did believe it to be his meaning, why did they stop short of what was
</p>
<p>their duty? And I tell you, that if you believe that was the meaning
</p>
<p>of Mr. O'Connell, you are bound to acquit every one of the traversers
</p>
<p>in this indictment, because, if you believe that to be his meaning, I
</p>
<p>tell you, subject to be corrected by the Court, that Mr. O'Connell was
</p>
<p>guilty of high treason, and that the misdemeanor is merged in that
</p>
<p>higher offence, and you cannot convict him legally of the misdemeanor.
</p>
<p>He next says : " I think I perceive a fixed disposition on the part of
</p>
<p>some of our Saxon traducers to put us to the test." That, they would
</p>
<p>have you believe, meant to bring on the physical battle. " The efforts
</p>
<p>" already made by them have been most abortive and ridiculous. In the

</p>
<p>" midst of peace and tranquillity they are covering over the land with
</p>
<p>" troops; and I speak with the awful determination with which I com-
</p>
<p>" menced my address, in consequence of the news received this day."
</p>
<p>News from the cabinet council, held in London by the ministry had just
</p>
<p>arrived, accompanied by an article in the Times, plainly and clearly
</p>
<p>announcing to the Irish people that physical force was to be adopted
</p>
<p>by the Government, that the yeomanry was to be armed, that Ireland
</p>
<p>was to be by arms coerced; that was the news that had arrived.
</p>
<p>That that which Mr. O'Connell intended to be a constitutional, a legal,
</p>
<p>and a moral movement of the people, without the slightest possible an-
</p>
<p>ticipation of any sort of violence or force, was to be, by the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment, made the ground for commencing hostilities, by way of physical
</p>
<p>war ; that was the news. " If [this is another passage] they assail us
</p>
<p>" to-morrow, and if we shall conquer them, the first use we should make
</p>
<p>" of the victory would be to place the sceptre in the hand of our beloved
</p>
<p>419
</p>
<p>" Queen." Remember the great stress that is la id by the Attorney-Ge-
</p>
<p>neral on that passage. What ! said he, is a subject to talk of placing the
</p>
<p>sceptre in the hands of his Sovereign that already has possession of it ?
</p>
<p>What is the subject to mean by that except that he is first by force, and
</p>
<p>war, and rebellion, and insurrection, to take that sceptre out of the
</p>
<p>hands of that Sovereign? How else could he talk of restoring it to her ?
</p>
<p>That is his argument. But do you believe that Mr. O'Connell ever in the
</p>
<p>course of his long life, gifted as he is with a capacity and understand-
</p>
<p>ing, that belong to few persons  do you believe that he ever was dolt
</p>
<p>enough, driveller enough, idiot enough to imagine that he or any man,
</p>
<p>against the sense of the national body of British subjects, could wrest
</p>
<p>the sceptre from the hand to whom it belongs by hereditary, and just,
</p>
<p>and legal, and constitutional right ? He never could be absurd enough
</p>
<p>to fancy in his mind, or entertain the most distant notion on earth,
</p>
<p>that it could ever be in his power to have the bestowing of that sceptre
</p>
<p>on any human being- whatever, much less the Sovereign to whom it
</p>
<p>lightly, and properly, and justly belongs, aud belongs not with the
</p>
<p>assent  not with the consent  but with the heartfelt acclamation of
</p>
<p>every subject in every part of her dominions. He says, " Have we
</p>
<p>not the ordinary courage of the English ?" and oh, says the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General, what could they want courage for but for battle ? But,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, is no courage necessary to keep your peaceful and moral
</p>
<p>position, and to persevere against every threat of violence, and by the
</p>
<p>moral force of moral opinion, to seek for your rights by exposing the
</p>
<p>injustice you are suffering? Is no courage necessary for that? If
</p>
<p>a large body of the Irish population be in a state of wretchedness, of
</p>
<p>misery, and of real tribulation, and if they would call the attention of
</p>
<p>mankind to their suffering, is no moral courage necessary to enable
</p>
<p>them to assemble in peaceable but in multitudinous bodies, and there
</p>
<p>to expose the sufferings they are enduring, and the patience with
</p>
<p>which they endured them ? Is no moral courage necessary in the pur-
</p>
<p>suit of that honest and fair exposure, that legal and constitutional ex-
</p>
<p>posure of their sufferings ? Is no moral, and physical courage too,
</p>
<p>necessary, to carry them through that, without the commission of

</p>
<p>crime, or the appearance of any disposition to commit it? Is it fair
</p>
<p>to Mr. O'Connell to put the foul construction that has been put on
</p>
<p>that expression when he has explained what the courage he is speak-
</p>
<p>ing of is, not in one or two, or three, but in a series of speeches?
</p>
<p>He says: "Are we to be called slaves, and trampled underfoot?"
</p>
<p>alluding to the news that had come to Ireland of the army that was to
</p>
<p>be sent into Ireland to trample under foot those that would meet peace-
</p>
<p>ably. " They will never (he says) trample me at least. I was wrong,
</p>
<p>" they may trample me ! but it will be my dead body they shall tram-
</p>
<p>" pie upon, not the living man !" What does the Attorney-General tell
</p>
<p>you that means? That they shall not trample upon me until I have
</p>
<p>first regularly battled with them with pikes, and muskets, and can-
</p>
<p>non : we shall first meet in battle array, and have a battle, and I will
</p>
<p>fight in the battle until 1 am killed, and then, perhaps, they may
</p>
<p>trample upon me. But where were the soldiers or rebels that were
</p>
<p>420
</p>
<p>to stand to Mr. O'Connell's back in that physical battle ? Have they
</p>
<p>given you a single particle of evidence that in the whole length and
</p>
<p>breadth of the island, covered as it is by as vigilant, as active, as in-
</p>
<p>telligent, and as efficient a police as perhaps ever existed in this
</p>
<p>world  a police not ignorant of the inmost corner of the poorest hut
</p>
<p>on the whole of this island  a police without whose knowledge
</p>
<p>scarcely two peasants can meet together and speak together in any
</p>
<p>corner of the Island  have they brought before you one particle of
</p>
<p>evidence, having the whole body of that police open to their scrutiny,
</p>
<p>that one single man ever made one single movement in any part of
</p>
<p>Ireland towards a preparation of any description with a view to a
</p>
<p>physical contest? How, then, are you to be called upon to believe
</p>
<p>that Mr. O'Connell could have alluded to himself falling in battle?
</p>
<p>What he alluded to is plain. He was well aware that there was a
</p>
<p>vast amount of military force in the country, and that it was very
</p>
<p>possible that that force might be called into action for the purpose
</p>
<p>of scattering and dispersing one of the peaceable meetings convened
</p>
<p>for a purpose he considered legal  the constitutional purpose of peti-
</p>
<p>tioning Parliament. And what he meant to convey was manifestly
</p>
<p>this, that in the event of any such thing being attemped, the police
</p>
<p>and myrmidons of the Government would find him standing at his
</p>
<p>post, amid the peaceful multitude, unarmed and undismayed, and
</p>
<p>firmly resolved, despite of every menace, to use against his adversa-
</p>
<p>ries the only weapons he had ever used  the eloquent tongue and
</p>
<p>the expanded mind that God had endowed him with. That is the
</p>
<p>courage to which Mr. O'Connell manifestly referred, that was his de-
</p>
<p>termination, and when he alluded to death it is clearly evident that
</p>
<p>he used the word in no other signification than that, which I have at-
</p>
<p>tributed to it. " The high and haughty defiance" which he hurled
</p>
<p>at the Government had this signification, and nothing more : Send
</p>
<p>your armed troops against me if you please, with swords, bayonets,
</p>
<p>and artillery ; march your police against us if you please, cut me
</p>
<p>down if it so pleases you, but while you so threaten me I will still
</p>
<p>hold my ground, I will still occupy the post which I now hold ; I

</p>
<p>will still, despite of every threat, continue to address my fellow-
</p>
<p>subjects; you may trample me under foot if you choose, but I will
</p>
<p>persevere unto the end in the constitutional course which 1 have pro-
</p>
<p>posed to myself; I will draw no sword, but as long as life is left to
</p>
<p>me I will continue to fight against you with the only weapons I ever
</p>
<p>employed  my tongue and my mind. These weapons 1 will use to
</p>
<p>the end, and till the last hour of my life I will continue to expose you
</p>
<p>and your contemplated atrocity to the odium and execration of tfie
</p>
<p>whole human race. Such is the course that I will unswervingly pur-
</p>
<p>sue, and now attack me if you dare. Set at nought, if you dare, the
</p>
<p>opinions of the good and the wise all over the world ; dare to meet
</p>
<p>their indignation if you have the front to do it; dare all this, but I
</p>
<p>will still conquer you, for justice is on my side, and with me are en-
</p>
<p>listed the sympathies of all good and intelligent men. Such, Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, is the true meaning of Mr. O'Connell's menace : such the
</p>
<p>421
</p>
<p>only interpretation of which his words are fairly susceptible, for it is the
</p>
<p>only interpretation that can be reconciled with the whole tenor of his
</p>
<p>political life. Bear in mind my explanation of the passage till I read
</p>
<p>for you the extracts which as yet you have not heard. Now, hear how
</p>
<p>he proceeds : " They have taken one step of coercion, and may I ask
</p>
<p>" what is to prevent them taking another ? May not they send us to
</p>
<p>" the West Indies, as they have lately emancipated the Negroes, to
</p>
<p>" fill up their places ; oh ! it is not an imaginary case at all, for the
</p>
<p>" only Englishman that ever possessed Ireland sent eighty thousand
</p>
<p>" Irishmen to work as slaves, every one of whom perished in the
</p>
<p>" short space of twelve years, beneath the ungenial sun of the Indies.
</p>
<p>" Yes, Peel and Wellington may be second Cromwells, and might be
</p>
<p>" guilty of such acts of atrocity as the massacre of the ladies in the
</p>
<p>" Bull-ring of Wexford. But no; I am wrong. They never shall
</p>
<p>" do so." Does not this reference to an historical event necessa-
</p>
<p>rily indicate what description of death it was that he apprehended ?
</p>
<p>He compared his own case to that of the women Avho were slaugh-
</p>
<p>tered at Wexford, and expressed an apprehension that he, equally
</p>
<p>defenceless, and as little disposed as they were to have recourse to
</p>
<p>physical force for his protection, might be attacked and cut down like
</p>
<p>the ladies, while unarmed and pursuing a legal and constitutional
</p>
<p>course. That is clearly what he meant to convey. He then went on to
</p>
<p>ask, " What are the enjoyments of life to me if I cannot vindicate
</p>
<p>my fame and my country ?" What did he mean by vindicating his
</p>
<p>fame ? he meant redeeming his political pledge, for early in the
</p>
<p>commencement of the agitation he solemnly pledged himself, that if
</p>
<p>the people would take his advice, and, forgetful of sectarian diffe-
</p>
<p>rences, would unite together as one man, and adopt his peaceable
</p>
<p>doctrine, no matter what their creed, if they united in a peaceable
</p>
<p>complaint of their grievances, their moral combination would become
</p>
<p>irresistible, and they would necessarily become free. He felt that it
</p>
<p>was he who had led them into this movement, and, finding that the
</p>
<p>Government were threatening severe measures of force for the crush-
</p>
<p>ing of the agitation, he felt it to be his bounden duty to exhort them

</p>
<p>in the most earnest language to persevere in despite of every menace,
</p>
<p>and to continue in the constitutional course they had entered on, undis-
</p>
<p>mayed and undeterred by the contemplated movements of any Govern-
</p>
<p>ment. He told them still to persevere in their good cause, and cheered
</p>
<p>them on by the assurance, that moral force would finally be too strong
</p>
<p>for physical force. He next proceeds to say : "All that is delightful
</p>
<p>"  all that the enthusiasm of romance can fling round the human
</p>
<p>" heart  is centered in my love of Ireland. She never has been a
</p>
<p>" nation  for her own children had her split and rent asunder and
</p>
<p>" divided when the Saxon first polluted her verdant soil with his ac-
</p>
<p>cursed foot." And is not that true, Gentlemen  is it not literally
</p>
<p>true ? Have we not the authority of history for saying it is true ?
</p>
<p>Can this prosecution wipe facts from the page of history ? Pre-
</p>
<p>posterous idea ! Is not that true in reference to England herself as
</p>
<p>Well a3 to Ireland ? Did not the Saxon with his accursed foot invade
</p>
<p>422
</p>
<p>the land of the ancient Britons, banishing liberty and peace and
</p>
<p>happiness from their shores ? What nonsense it is to talk to twelve
</p>
<p>men upon their oaths, calling on them to subvert the evidence of
</p>
<p>historical record ! what monstrous drivelling and folly to expect that
</p>
<p>by a prosecution of this kind you can change and falsify the history
</p>
<p>of the human race ! For my part, I know not who the descendant of
</p>
<p>the Saxon is  neither does Mr. O'Connell. I know not where to
</p>
<p>look for the man (nor does Mr. O'Connell) upon whose shoulder I
</p>
<p>can put my hand and say: " You are one of the murderous Saxons
</p>
<p>who invaded this country in the time of the Britons." No; it is
</p>
<p>morally and physically impossible that any man could do so, for the
</p>
<p>blood of the conquerors and of the conquered have long since inter-
</p>
<p>mingled, and the races are no longer distinct. Mr. O'Connell was
</p>
<p>alluding to the men and scenes of by-gone days, in order to warn
</p>
<p>the living not to follow the bad example of their dissensions. And
</p>
<p>that this was his meaning is clearly to be seen by a perusal of sub-
</p>
<p>sequent passages of his speech. He then goes on to say : " From
</p>
<p>" that day to this, dissensions and divisions, together with a
</p>
<p>" false confidence in the honour of the enemy, and penal laws,
</p>
<p>" all, all have contributed to keep her in peril and degradation." Is not
</p>
<p>that true, literally and strictly true? Has not Ireland been divided
</p>
<p>and split into poor miserable factions, by wretches pretending patriot-
</p>
<p>ism, but each one seeking only his own profit, advantage and gain,
</p>
<p>with a total disregard for his country ? These facts ought to be wiped
</p>
<p>from the page of history if it be treason to refer to them. Again, he
</p>
<p>says : " But the hour is come when her people can be a nation, and if
</p>
<p>" they follow the counsel that they get, their country will be their own.
</p>
<p>" I feel it now to be my duty to warn you against these Saxons." But
</p>
<p>who were the men whom Mr. O'Connell designated by the appellation
</p>
<p>of "Saxons" ? Surely he must have meant to refer to men who, like the
</p>
<p>Saxons, would invade this country with arms in their hands  men who
</p>
<p>would decide arguments not by reason, nor by justice, but by the sword
</p>
<p>and the bayonet. " Perhaps a few days will tell us what they mean."
</p>
<p>There again, says the Attorney-General, is deep sedition. What phy-

<p>cal contest, allow me to ask you, Gentlemen, could he have expected ?
</p>
<p>Where was the military organization  where was the training  where
</p>
<p>were the arms  where were the officers ? Oh ! but he had officers too.
</p>
<p>Did he not say that his men would follow the Repeal Wardens as well
</p>
<p>as the soldiers could follow the sergeants? Did he mean by that, that
</p>
<p>they could follow them into the field of battle? Yes, the kind of
</p>
<p>battle that he was fighting. That they would follow them to those
</p>
<p>peaceable, legal, and constitutional meetings for exposing their griev-
</p>
<p>ances ; he meant that they could follow them there. But could he
</p>
<p>possibly have been the dolt to expect any man to believe that he had
</p>
<p>other intentions ? They could not walk together, as Captain Despard
</p>
<p>told you, and yet you are told in effect that he boasted they could fol-
</p>
<p>low their Repeal Wardens to the battle ! A battle without arms,
</p>
<p>without discipline, without officers, without any thing in the world
</p>
<p>calculated to make them any thing except victims to be slaughtered.
</p>
<p>423
</p>
<p>Are you, twelve Gentlemen of sense, to be called on to believe that
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, in his mind, ever contemplated any one of those atro-
</p>
<p>cious acts of rebellion imputed to him ; or that he ever so expressed
</p>
<p>himself with the view that any body should so understand him? Will
</p>
<p>it be for a moment argued that he at any time contemplated a physi-
</p>
<p>cal-force contest between the Repealers and the army ? Do you sup-
</p>
<p>pose that he would ever have let them know that he entertained those
</p>
<p>ideas if he really did entertain them, or that his hearers could so un-
</p>
<p>derstand him ? Gentlemen, they did not so understand him ; but the
</p>
<p>Crown want you, hoping that, perhaps, you may be politically opposed
</p>
<p>to him, to fasten upon this construction as a pretext, because you
</p>
<p>have him in your power, and avail yourselves of this false interpreta-
</p>
<p>tion, in order to put down Repeal.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I will not address you upon your oaths ; I will
</p>
<p>address you upon your honour. I know not whether you are
</p>
<p>the political opponents of Mr. O'Connell or not, but if you are
</p>
<p>I am glad of it, for your verdict will do the greater credit to
</p>
<p>you and to your country. Your verdict will be then a verdict
</p>
<p>to which it will be impossible to say yea or nay. If he be guilty
</p>
<p>as a conspirator, convict him, uncaring consequences ; but if he
</p>
<p>be not that foul conspirator, I entertain no apprehension from
</p>
<p>any of those twelve Gentlemen I see in the box, although they may
</p>
<p>not be personally known to me, or I to them, with two or three excep-
</p>
<p>tions, their faces are familiar to me, their names are familiar to me,
</p>
<p>and their character is known to me. Do not imagine I want to per-
</p>
<p>suade you to find a verdict against the evidence ; far, far be it from
</p>
<p>me : my humble efforts shall be directed to this single object, to open-
</p>
<p>ing your eyes thoroughly to the whole case, and doing so honestly and
</p>
<p>fairly, and without the smallest exaggeration. You have those pas-
</p>
<p>sages in Mr. O'Connell's speech that I read to you, and let me now
</p>
<p>call your attention to some other passages from his speeches through-
</p>
<p>out the agitation, to which your attention has not yet been directed.
</p>
<p>I shall now proceed to read to you a few passages from his speeches,
</p>
<p>which I think you ought to be made acquainted with ; and if 1 should

</p>
<p>occupy your time at some length in doing so, I trust you will remem-
</p>
<p>ber that some forty or fifty hours were spent in reading passages against
</p>
<p>him. From a speech of his delivered at the Association, on the
</p>
<p>13th of September, 1841, I shall read you an extract; and it
</p>
<p>is quite essential that your attention should be drawn to the sen-
</p>
<p>timents of Mr. O'Connell, during that period of the agitation.
</p>
<p>He says : " We all know what the Chartists have done. We know
</p>
<p>" who their leaders are in Dublin, and that the attempts made by
</p>
<p>" them in Ireland have been totally abortive. In Drogheda the
</p>
<p>" clique was broken up, and Hoey, who came over from Barnsley,
</p>
<p>" found he had nothing to do. To that, of course, he would not oij-
</p>
<p>" ject  but he found, at all events, that Ireland was not the place for
</p>
<p>" the physical-force men, and he went back again. It was said that
</p>
<p>" Chartism had made some head at Loughrea, but if there was any-
</p>
<p>" thing of the kind, there is little doubt that it would soon be put down
</p>
<p>" by that pious and exemplary prelate, the Right Reverend Doctor
</p>
<p>424
</p>
<p>" Cohen, the Catholic bishop. He would give his valuable assistance
</p>
<p>" in hunting the Feargusites out of Loughrea. We do not repudiate
</p>
<p>" Chartists because they bear that name, but we cannot associate with
</p>
<p>" men who have been stained with crimes of the most dangerous and
</p>
<p>" evil tendency. . . . And see now how the case is at the moment
</p>
<p>" that the Chartists wish that we should join them. Instead of re-
</p>
<p>" gretting the acts of insurrection and sedition in which they have
</p>
<p>" been engaged, we find them cheering those who were convicted on
</p>
<p>" the merits of being guilty of such crimes. Frost, Williams, and
</p>
<p>" Jones, although a point of law was raised in their favour afterwards,
</p>
<p>" which had the effect of saving their lives, were convicted on the
</p>
<p>" clearest testimony, of being engaged in open insurrection; and yet
</p>
<p>" we find the Chartists cheering them and looking upon them as mar-
</p>
<p>" tyrs. The Irish Repealers cannot have anything to do with such
</p>
<p>" men. We cannot allow our cause to be stained by such means.
</p>
<p>" We cannot, without tarnishing our cause, and putting ourselves in
</p>
<p>" danger, join them, and I caution the Repealers of England from
</p>
<p>" uniting with them. Suppose, now, that we were to join the
</p>
<p>" Chartists, and that a Tory Attorney-General took it into his head
</p>
<p>u to prosecute a member of this Association, what a theme he would
</p>
<p>" have to dwell upon when addressing a jury ! He would say :
</p>
<p>" ' Oh ! Gentlemen, he is one of the Repeal Association, who frater-
</p>
<p>" ' nizes with the torch-and-dagger men of England  he is a part and
</p>
<p>" ' parcel of that confederation, many of whose members have been al-
</p>
<p>" ' ready tried and convicted, upon the clearest testimony of high
</p>
<p>u ' treason and sedition.' " He is here speaking of the Chartists.
</p>
<p>Now do not forget the imputations upon Mr. O'Connell, that he had
</p>
<p>his eye fixed on an insurrection, a physical-force contest with the
</p>
<p>constituted authorities of the country. Observe how he deals
</p>
<p>with the party, the powerful party, the unanimous party, the
</p>
<p>insurrectionary party in England. Was not the movement in
</p>
<p>England the very thing of all others that he would have been glad
</p>
<p>to avail himself of, if his intentions were such as they have been
</p>
<p>represented? He calls the Chartists the Feargusites; he abso-

</p>
<p>lutely nicknamed them ; he showers contempt upon them. If
</p>
<p>he hoped to avail himself of them, or to make any use of
</p>
<p>their insurrectionary movement, is that the language he would have
</p>
<p>held towards them ? See, Gentlemen, what unequalled abuse he
</p>
<p>heaps upon them  what scorn, and contumely, and contempt he pours
</p>
<p>out on the physical-force men, the torch-and-dagger men. Does he
</p>
<p>utter one word of approbation of their proceedings, or show any pity
</p>
<p>or countenance for them ? Here again, in another speech of his, at
</p>
<p>the meeting of the Association on the 16th of the same month.
</p>
<p>He was speaking of the Catholics of Maryland, who had offered
</p>
<p>the Association their support, and in proposing the reply to their
</p>
<p>communication, he says : " That reply should be deliberately
</p>
<p>" framed, with the caution and care becoming men who are
</p>
<p>" determined that in any thing done by them, they shall not
</p>
<p>" hold out the slightest idea of violating or infringing the law or con-
</p>
<p>" stitution, or any contingency." They would not violate the law and
</p>
<p>constitution, on any contingency " They [the Catholics of
</p>
<p>425
</p>
<p>" Maryland] introduced in the body of their charter entitling them
</p>
<p>" to their land, a provision, that conscience should be free, and that
</p>
<p>" religion should be unshackled by the atrocity of human persecution.
</p>
<p>" They had in their hearts the spirit of pure Christianity, and they
</p>
<p>" proclaimed this as the free basis of their social association and com-
</p>
<p>" pact, that Christianity was an affair between man and his Creator,
</p>
<p>" and that the human law was atrocious that limited the operations
</p>
<p>'* of conscience. It is a delightful spectacle to witness such liberality ;
</p>
<p>" and it is an equally gratifying fact to know, that some years after-
</p>
<p>" wards, it being necessary to put this principle of religious freedom
</p>
<p>" in the shape of a positive enactment, the law was immediately
</p>
<p>u passed, there being four-fifths of the members of the Legislature
</p>
<p>" Catholics. Yes, these men were unanimous in carrying out that
</p>
<p>" principle to the fullest extent in their official station in the colony,
</p>
<p>" and that Act of Parliament was drawn up by a Jesuit The
</p>
<p>" Catholics, about the year 1672, got into power and authority again,
</p>
<p>" and their first act was to proclaim once again the principles of
</p>
<p>" liberty of conscience But rejoicing that that spirit is gone
</p>
<p>" by, and that in that happy country, man meets man on the same
</p>
<p>u footing, without any distinction of creed or religion, and each
</p>
<p>" stands before the other in the dignity and integrity of conscientious
</p>
<p>"feeling, free from the taint of party politics, or religious ascen-
</p>
<p>" dancy, or the gift of undue power to any." Is that the statement of
</p>
<p>a man seeking party power and sectarian ascendancy ? I ask is there any
</p>
<p>good man in society who should not feel grateful to him for the dissemi-
</p>
<p>nation of such sentiments ? " The Irish Catholics were three times in
</p>
<p>" power since the Reformation, and they never persecuted asinglePro-

</p>
<p>" and let them know that we desire only to consolidate the strength of
</p>
<p>" the British empire, by making every portion of that empire prosperous
</p>
<p>" and happy. I wish to observe, that our resolutions respecting the
</p>
<p>" Chartists, which were passed at the last meeting, have not, as yet,
</p>
<p>" appeared in the Register, and it is most important that they should
</p>
<p>" appear in that paper ; for it is of consequence that they should be

</p>
<p>" read through every part of England. I hope, therefore, they will
</p>
<p>" appear in the Register to-morrow All we wanted wasjustice
</p>
<p>" and equity. We wanted to put no person down. We wanted only
</p>
<p>" to be on equal footing with them. I did not say that Irishmen
</p>
<p>" would go over to cut down or oppose Englishmen seeking for their
</p>
<p>" rights. I could not say anything so absurd; but I did say, that, if
</p>
<p>" an attempt was made, no matter from what quarter, to subvert the
</p>
<p>" Throne, 500,000 Irishmen would be found ready to lay down their
</p>
<p>" lives to defend it " Such is the language of the man who is
</p>
<p>bi-andedtoyou as a foul conspirator, who it is said has treason in his heart
</p>
<p>when he has peace on his tongue. " As to the Rechabite Society, or
</p>
<p>" any other society, the members of which are known to each other
</p>
<p>" by secret signs or passwords, it is illegal, and subjects those be-
</p>
<p>" longing to it to transportation "
</p>
<p>Well, you have heard what he said about the physical-force
</p>
<p>men in England and Ireland. You remember, Gentlemen, that
</p>
<p>3i
</p>
<p>426
</p>
<p>it was said, on the part of the prosecution, that the Repeal Association
</p>
<p>was an illegal society, and that the cards were their passwords.
</p>
<p>You recollect it was insinuated that the cards of the Repeal Association
</p>
<p>were the signs by which the members were known to each other.
</p>
<p>Now, let me ask you what is a password? Is it not a secret sign by
</p>
<p>which the members of a secret, and therefore criminal association, are
</p>
<p>known to each other, without being known to other persons who are
</p>
<p>not members of that society? Does that definition of password agree
</p>
<p>with common sense, and is not that the received meaning of the term ?
</p>
<p>Did you ever hear of the members of any illegal and secret society,
</p>
<p>going out in multitudinous assemblages, and telling the whole world
</p>
<p>their passwords? Did not the members of the Association go to the
</p>
<p>multitudinous meetings with their cards in their hats ? They went to
</p>
<p>the meetings with their cards in their hats, i. e., with their passwords,
</p>
<p>as you were told these cards are thus exhibited  and you are called
</p>
<p>on to believe that these cards were as passwords, and yet that these
</p>
<p>men went out in this open manner, and told this their secret password
</p>
<p>to the whole world. Will you believe that ; can you credit it ? Can
</p>
<p>you forget that the cards were carried out in the open day ; and yet
</p>
<p>you are called on to believe they were secret signs and passwords.
</p>
<p>Such monstrous contradiction I have never heard, between men's acts
</p>
<p>and the motives imputed to them, and yet you are to be blinded by
</p>
<p>mere statement, and called on to give a verdict contrary to common
</p>
<p>reason, and rebutted by evidence of the plainest and most conclusive
</p>
<p>nature. Really, Gentlemen, this assertion that the cards were a pass-
</p>
<p>word is so absurd that I will not dwell on it longer. Mr. O'Connell then
</p>
<p>goes on: " Now, I tell Mr. Dawes, who, I believe means well, that I did
</p>
<p>" say, and I now repeat it, that any man belonging to that society is
</p>
<p>" guilty of a transportable offence, and liable to be prosecuted at any
</p>
<p>" moment. . . . It is, however, enough to say, that the society is illegal,
</p>
<p>" and that any of its members are liable to be prosecuted for a transpor-
</p>
<p>" table offence. So much for this society in England. I recollect the
</p>
<p>" Ribbon system here, when I put it down in four counties ; it was re-
</p>
<p>" vived again, and no oath was necessary in becoming a member ; like

<p> the Rechabites, they had quarterly passwords, which were paid for
</p>
<p>" by the members, and in which some of the officers, as they were
</p>
<p>" called, carried on a profitable traffic Teetotalism should ne-
</p>
<p>" ver be mixed up with any secret society. Father Matthew says
</p>
<p>" that teetotalers have no politics  quite true ; as a body, they are no
</p>
<p>" politicians, but at the same time each individual should hold his
</p>
<p>" own politics, so that they were not mingled with sectarian feelings,
</p>
<p> or ill-will towards those whom he thought differed from him. Tee-
</p>
<p>" totalism has been magnificently glorious to the people of Ireland,
</p>
<p>" and it may yet be so to the great body of the people of England ;
</p>
<p>" and as I feel deep anxiety for those Rechabites who seemed to be,
</p>
<p>" partly, at least, composed of teetotalers, I beg to tell them that
</p>
<p>" their society, and every secret society, is illegal It will be
</p>
<p>" said, I suppose, that I want to separate the two countries ; that I
</p>
<p>" want only to injure England ; and that the first thought in my mind
</p>
<p>"is the injury of England, and not the advantage of Ireland ; but
</p>
<p>" those are calumnies I am prepared to meet." Again, hear Mr.
</p>
<p>427
</p>
<p>O'Connell at the Association, in September, 1841. " Mr. OConnell
</p>
<p>V moved that the newspaper be obtained wherein a statement was
</p>
<p>" made by them [the Chartists], that the sceptre and the cross should
</p>
<p>*f be pulled down together, and he believed that the greatest enemies,
</p>
<p>" both to religion and liberty, at present in existence, were those
</p>
<p>" men : they would not listen to arguments, they would not listen to
</p>
<p>" reason, but they quarrelled with every man who did not go so far
</p>
<p>" as they went themselves, and it was creditable to the operatives of
</p>
<p>" Ireland, upon whom the Chartists were forcing themselves, to keep
</p>
<p>" aloof from them Under the sanction of the highest morality
</p>
<p>" and purest sense of religion, they would proceed, unstained by crime
</p>
<p>" and unallied to those who sanctioned and approved of a violation of
</p>
<p>" the laws The good sense of the coal-porters, and of the peo-
</p>
<p>" pie of Ireland generally, is manifested by their total abhorrence of
</p>
<p>" Chartism He would say for Ireland, that nothing could be
</p>
<p>" further from her intention, than to seek a separation from England,
</p>
<p>" and such an event could never occur The Irish were unwil-
</p>
<p>" ling to separate from England. The Irish did not want separation,
</p>
<p>" they wanted nothing but legislative independence I am here
</p>
<p>" counsel for the Tories as well as the Liberals, for they are Irishmen,
</p>
<p>" and are entitled to the rights of Irishmen, and I care not for their
</p>
<p>" politics, remember the motto : Ireland for the Irish and the Irish
</p>
<p>"for Ireland." The Attorney-General would have you believe what
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell meant by that was, to have Ireland for one particular
</p>
<p>party, and to establish what the Attorney-General called a ferocious
</p>
<p>republic. Does he not here explain himself  Does he not mean
</p>
<p>Irishmen of every grade and of every political opinion ? " They are, as
</p>

</p>
<p>you regret that the man who could preach such truly liberal sentiments
</p>
<p>with so eloquent a tongue, in such persuasive language, of which he
</p>
<p>is so perfect a master, was listened to  can you regret that these
</p>
<p>sentiments should have been heard and assented to by millions of
</p>
<p>your fellow-countrymen ? Can the mind of man conceive that the
</p>
<p>man who could conceive these lofty and moral sentiments, which
</p>
<p>do credit and honour to human nature, could be in the very act of
</p>
<p>expressing them, a deliberate and foul conspirator, who was planning
</p>
<p>428
</p>
<p>a. cruel war and the destruction of his fellow-subjects. Can you be-
</p>
<p>lieve that the man who could use language such as I have read to you,
</p>
<p>could be at the same moment and in the very act of expressing these
</p>
<p>sentiments, guilty of treason. Again, at the Board of Trade, on the
</p>
<p>23rd September. " The fact is, we have heretofore had all parties
</p>
<p>in Ireland except an Irish party." Is not that true, literally true,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen  is it not an historical fact  have you not had all parties
</p>
<p>in Ireland except an Irish party  have you not seen the public of all
</p>
<p>parties led on by selfish leaders, who had nothing in view but their
</p>
<p>own selfish ends? Is it not a melancholly fact, that the great body
</p>
<p>of society have at all times looked on in silent abhorrence, and beheld
</p>
<p>with contempt, and execration the leaders of every party in Ireland,
</p>
<p>pursuing their selfish ends; pretending public good, but pursuing in-
</p>
<p>dividual ambition, to be gratified at the expense of the respectable
</p>
<p>and honest portion of the community ? Is it not the fact, that there
</p>
<p>never was an honest party seeking only the public goo<L in Ireland ?
</p>
<p>I ask you to tell me when there was, if it ever existed? He further
</p>
<p>says: " Orangemen and Rockites, Blackfeet and Whitefeet, Hearts
</p>
<p>" of Oak and Hearts of Steel, Whigs, Tories, Radicals  I am sick
</p>
<p>" of them all ; what honest man, Gentlemen, is not sick of them. I must
</p>
<p>" have a party of Irishmen, bound together in the love of our common
</p>
<p>u country, and whose happiness will be their dearest objeet. I am glad
</p>
<p>" to see that even in this room I will not stand alone in this determi-
</p>
<p>*' nation. It is full time that we merge all party and sectarian dis-
</p>
<p>" tinctions in the one universal desire to benefit our native land. Let
</p>
<p>" us differ no longer with a man because of his religion. If he be
</p>
<p>" wrong, that is his own affair, not mine. For my part, I can never
</p>
<p>" fall out with my neighbour for his religion, for I find I have quite
</p>
<p>" enough to do to mind mine own  Heaven help me. And indeed,
</p>
<p>" I think if we would generally come to the resolution of paying to
</p>
<p>u our own religion one-half the attention we now direct to that of
</p>
<p>" other people, we would be all better and happier far. Let no Irish-
</p>
<p>" man so far forget himself, as to qnarrel with his brother for his doc-
</p>

</p>
<p>" skin." Gentlemen, that is a liberal and an expressive illustration.
</p>
<p>A man may as justly be condemned for the skin which nature gave
</p>
<p>him, as for the religion which the chance of birth and education
</p>
<p>equally forced upon him. Where is the honest man who can dissent
</p>
<p>from that sentiment who must not respect it ? where is the Christian
</p>
<p>man who will not close with that sentiment and say that the man in-
</p>
<p>culcating it has acted the part of a Christian. Mr. O'Connell tells
</p>
<p>them they had no right to quarrel about religion, because whatever
</p>
<p>religion a man was educated in he must follow, and it was not his volun-
</p>
<p>tary act to do so, for he could no more help entertaining it, than he
</p>
<p>could the quality of his skin. The man who inculcates such a senti-
</p>
<p>ment is a friend to the human race, and yet you are to brand him as a
</p>
<p>foul conspirator. " In this world, at least, let every Irishman be bound
</p>
<p>" in affection to his fellow, and let him leave the question of religion
</p>
<p>" with his God in the next. . . . We look with no feelings of ill-will,
</p>
<p>" or of aversion upon England ; we wish not to weaken the British
</p>
<p>" connexion ; we are attached in kindly feelings to the English throne,
</p>
<p>429
</p>
<p>" as it is at present occupied ; we regard the Queen with affection-
</p>
<p>" ate gratitude for the kindness of disposition she has manifested
</p>
<p>"towards us; nor have we any desire to transgress our allegiance
</p>
<p>" to her as loyal subjects. It is calculated to do us benefit ; it can-
</p>
<p>" not injure, nay, it would be a great and positive advantage to Ire-
</p>
<p>" land, if we had a Parliament of our own. Then, indeed, the con-
</p>
<p>" nexion would be eminently calculated to advance our prosperity
</p>
<p>"and promote our happiness. . . . We must keep compactly within
</p>
<p>" the confines of the law. In apolitical society the administering of
</p>
<p>" a pledge were illegal ; not so, however, in a Board of Trade."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, is it possible, let me ask you, to imagine that a man
</p>
<p>who could entertain those liberal, those enlarged, moral, and religious
</p>
<p>feelings, and express them in such language, is it possible to believe
</p>
<p>that he, at the same moment, had the black heart and foul mind of a
</p>
<p>conspirator? Again, at the Association, on the 28th of September,
</p>
<p>1841, he says : " I am not for any sect or party, but for the good of
</p>
<p>" the entife people. I care not what religious denomination a man
</p>
<p>" may have, my object is to advance his happiness equally with that
</p>
<p>" of all others of my fellow-countrymen. My wish is to create a
</p>
<p>" feeling of Irishism in the country among my fellow-countrymen of
</p>
<p>" every religious denomination. I wish that every individual of the
</p>
<p>" land should feel that he is an Irishman, and should desire to see
</p>
<p>" his native country prosperous and happy." Will any man dis-
</p>
<p>sent from that sentiment? Will any of you tell the distracted,
</p>
<p>divided, worn-down people of this country, that the man who preaches
</p>
<p>such principles is nothing but a conspirator ? What will you tell
</p>
<p>by that but that they must lie down under their miseries, or
</p>
<p>else that they must unite together in parties of real conspirators.
</p>
<p>Moral instruction they cannot hope for, if the man who preaches
</p>
<p>loyalty and love of country, peace and good-will amongst all, must
</p>
<p>be regarded by them as a conspirator. Is that what you are pre-
</p>
<p>pared to tell them by your verdict ? Was he a statesman who
</p>
<p>directed these prosecutions ? Was he an ^houest man or a fool,
</p>
<p>and what did he hope to effect by them ? Am I addressing men

</p>
<p>who are interested in the good of their country ? If I am, you
</p>
<p>will give by your verdict a lesson which the Minister will not
</p>
<p>soon forget. Again he says : " I wish to state, before the meet-
</p>
<p>" ing separates, that I have received several communications re-
</p>
<p>" specting the Rechabite Societies in England and Scotland, and
</p>
<p>" in reply to them I have to observe that my conviction is,
</p>
<p>" these societies are illegal, and any man that belongs to them,
</p>
<p>" either in England or in Scotland, is liable to prosecution for a mis-
</p>
<p>" demeanor, and is punishable with transportation." Again at the
</p>
<p>Association, on the 5th of October, he says : "I am for obtaining
</p>
<p>" the highest political advantages by means of the law and the Con-
</p>
<p>" stitution, by a struggle of all good and peaceable men, and without
</p>
<p>" shedding one drop of human blood, the violation of any right, or
</p>
<p>u the spoliation or injury of one particle of human property." ....
</p>
<p>Is it criminal to obtain political advantages by those means ? to
</p>
<p>obtain them by legal means, without spilling one drop of blood,
</p>
<p>or injury to a particle of human property. Is he a criminal who
</p>
<p>430
</p>
<p>sought to effect his purpose by those means ? Is he a conspirator ?
</p>
<p>If that be law and sanctioned by your opinion, then, indeed, we live
</p>
<p>under strange laws. " The people of Ireland mean to obtain the
</p>
<p>" restoration of their native Parliament by those means which all wise
</p>
<p>" and good men could sanction, and on which, I trust, Providence will
</p>
<p>" smile  by means of the law and the constitution. The law is
</p>
<p>" good enough, and the constitution abundantly sufficient for that pur-
</p>
<p>" pose, and we can, without any difficulty, work out our political sal-
</p>
<p>" vation in the channels which that law and constitution give us.
</p>
<p><'.... I move that that letter be inserted on our minutes, and that
</p>
<p>" the thanks of the Association be given to the Repealers of Salford
</p>
<p>" and the neighbouring towns, for resisting any entreaties of the
</p>
<p>" Chartists to join their illegal association. The Chartists are men
</p>
<p>" of fire and faggot, of slaughter and bloodshed. They have already
</p>
<p>" signalized their principles by an attack on the Queen's troops, in
</p>
<p>" which they were defeated It is our most sincere wish that
</p>
<p>" turbulence and outrage should be suppressed; but I thank my God
</p>
<p>" that although such a state of things had at one time prevailed to a
</p>
<p>" certain extent, it has so diminished, that at present it may be said
</p>
<p>" to have scarcely existence at all in this country. ... I respect the
</p>
<p>" rights of the landlords ; I do not want, far be the thought from me,
</p>
<p>" to plunder them of their properties We will not violate any
</p>
<p>" law. . . . We seek but for equality with England  we seek no
</p>
<p>" more. ... I move, Sir, a form of address to our revered and be-
</p>
<p>" loved Sovereign, who is not the Queen of a faction or a party,
</p>
<p>" but of her entire people. She is not the Queen whose health has
</p>
<p>l< been received with nine times nine, and rounds of the Kentish fire,
</p>
<p>" by the Orange Association. No ; but a Queen who the first of
</p>
<p>" her race who has shown a disposition to do perfect justice and fair-
</p>
<p>" ness to Ireland ; the Queen who has evinced, in a peculiar de-
</p>
<p>" gree, some of those qualities which distinguished her race, without
</p>
<p>" their obstinacy, in her blessed perseverance to reign for the benefit
</p>
<p>" of her entire people." Is that the language of a traitor? Must

<p>not every loyal man be grateful for the application and exercise

<p>of that eloquence which Providence gave him in thus pourtraying this
</p>
<p>beautiful picture, from the beautiful, the good, and the benignant
</p>
<p>original, in language calculated to enlarge the noblest ideas which
</p>
<p>the most loyal subject oould have formed of our Sovereign  calcu-
</p>
<p>lated to increase loyalty, and endear the Queen to every heart ?
</p>
<p>Must not every British subject that loves the benignant, the singu-
</p>
<p>larly benignant Sovereign, the truly innocent and amiable Sovereign
</p>
<p>who rules us ; must not every man who would wish to see such a So-
</p>
<p>vereign truly beloved, truly esteemed, and truly revered, have a feel-
</p>
<p>ing of gratitudeto the orator who has used his eloquence for so useful
</p>
<p>and so good an object ? Are you by your verdict to tell the people of
</p>
<p>this country, the suffering millions of this country, that the man who
</p>
<p>preached admiration, love, and reverence towards the Sovereign, is yet
</p>
<p>a traitor to that Sovereign, is a conspirator against the peace of the
</p>
<p>country and the safety of the throne of that Sovereign. Gentlemen, I
</p>
<p>do not apprehend you will do anything so absurd. Again on the 11th of
</p>
<p>October  hear how he speaks of the Chartists, and the course of agi-
</p>
<p>431
</p>
<p>tation pursued by them ; what just execration he heaps upon the pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings of this body: " He had every reason to hope that a higher
</p>
<p>" feeling of conciliation and Christian charity would supply their
</p>
<p>* place This, however, he well knew, that there ever would
</p>
<p>" be an impediment to national glory and prosperity until the small
</p>
<p>" stream of peaceful reconciliation became, like the Shannon, the
</p>
<p>" beauty of living waters, when the ark of Repeal would float
</p>
<p>" proudly and triumphantly on its surface As Chartism had
</p>
<p>" been mentioned, he should take that opportunity of reading to the
</p>
<p>" meeting a passage from Feargus O'Connor's own Journal, which
</p>
<p>" some person happened to send him. The passage was in a letter
</p>
<p>" of Feargus's to the Chartists of the United Kingdom of Great Bri-
</p>
<p>" tain and Ireland. How much Feargus loved the Union. The pas-
</p>
<p>" sage was as follows : ' All Ireland is coming round to Chartism.
</p>
<p>** We shall soon have them all with us to a man.' All Ireland
</p>
<p>*' coming round to them, indeed. Why, he might as well attempt
</p>
<p>" to put Ireland upon wheels, and wheel it to him. He would just
</p>
<p>il succeed in bringing Irishmen round to Chartism by such a project
</p>
<p>u as by any other attempt. Hearing the mention of Chartism, at the
</p>
<p>" moment he could not resist the opportunity of letting them see the
</p>
<p>" notion entertained by Feargus as to Chartism in Ireland. . . . The fact
</p>
<p>" of these Reverend Gentlemen, with such numbers of others of their
</p>
<p>" order, coming forward to join with them for Repeal, proved clearly
</p>
<p>" and beyond all doubt, if other proof were wanted, that they (the
</p>
<p>" Repealers) were acting rightly and legally. It showed that there
</p>
<p>" was no immorality, turbulence, or any thing criminal whatever in
</p>
<p>" the proceedings or the objects of the Association ; because, if there
</p>
<p>" were any such in the remotest degree to be found amongst them,
</p>
<p>" these truly good and pious men would never for a moment think
</p>
<p>" of having anything to do with them. It showed two things. First,
</p>
<p>" the legality and perfectly peaceable character of their proceedings
</p>
<p>" and their object, and that neither the law of God or man was vio-
</p>
<p>" lated .... Some of themselves might go to these meetings as a
</p>
<p>" part of their own body ; in fact, as individuals, but not as dele-

</p>
<p>" gates. In truth, he was pushing the law to the utmost extremity ;
</p>
<p>" but having guided the Catholic Association perfectly free from
</p>
<p>" every legal danger, he was most anxious that a word should not es-
</p>
<p>" cape in the Repeal Association, which could be laid hold of." If
</p>
<p>he had in view the possibility of a physical struggle, do you think he
</p>
<p>would have spoken thus of those who were ready to co-operate in
</p>
<p>such a struggle. Again on the 18th of October, at the Association,
</p>
<p>he says : "Any man, who has one particle of the statesman about
</p>
<p>" him, will recollect that the great evil of the country is agrarian
</p>
<p>" disturbances, and those agrarian disturbances are rendered more
</p>
<p>" horrible by the assassination of landlords and land-agents. That
</p>
<p>" crime that has been most frightful in Ireland is the crime of de-
</p>
<p>" liberate murder, committed upon the landlord, the agent of the
</p>
<p>" landlord, or the in-coming tenant. Every statesman must know
</p>
<p>" the cause of that, and Lord Eliot must know, for he must have
</p>
<p>" read the evidence given before the Committee of the House of
</p>
<p>" Commons, and the Committee of the House of Lords, showing
</p>
<p>432
</p>
<p>" that there was no instance yet of agrarian disturbances that was
</p>
<p>" not attributable to the practice of clearing the land, and turning
</p>
<p>" out the tenantry. It is a frightful mischief against which we have
</p>
<p>" directed all our influence, against which the law has levelled all its
</p>
<p>" batteries, and against which the clergymen of the Catholic persua-
</p>
<p>" sion have lifted up their hands in supplication to God, and in en-
</p>
<p>" treaty to man. It is a crime that has frighted the land, and dis-
</p>
<p>" graced Ireland, this assassination of landlords, agents, and in-coming
</p>
<p>" tenants. How often from this place have we thundered, in the
</p>
<p>" loudest voice we could, the cry that the red arm of God's ven-
</p>
<p>" geance was always extended over the murderer ; that, sooner or
</p>
<p>" later, he would meet with condign punishment in this world ; and
</p>
<p>" that, if he were so fortunate as to escape that punishment here,
</p>
<p>" it was only to make the punishment hereafter more hideous, as it
</p>
<p>" would be eternal. ... If there be anything that a statesman should
</p>
<p>" desire to heal, it is that species of crime ; but he is not a states-
</p>
<p>" man that can think that he will heal that crime without removing
</p>
<p>" the cause." Is not that an eloquent, able, and rational appeal to
</p>
<p>the two parties involved in that unfortunate struggle, to the mis-
</p>
<p>guided landlords  if any such there be  who may have provoked
</p>
<p>threats of vengeance from the miserable peasantry, and to the delu-
</p>
<p>ded peasantry, to abstain from their criminal revenge ? Again, on the
</p>
<p>26th of October, he said at the Association : " Now what I am look-
</p>
<p>*' ing for ; the object of this Association  is to prevent separation. We
</p>
<p>" are looking for Repeal to prevent the possibility of separation. . . .
</p>
<p>" We will offer no violence to the prejudices or predilections of
</p>
<p>" any man. . . . Ireland shall achieve all that is gay in vitality, re-
</p>
<p>" strained within the bounds of the Constitution, avowing a heart-
</p>
<p>" binding allegiance to the throne, to free institutions, and deter-
</p>
<p>" mined alone upon achieving the protection of an independent
</p>
<p>" Irish Legislature Our movement, however, for the redress of
</p>
<p>" grievances will be tranquil, legal, constitutional ; we will not have
</p>
<p>" recourse to violence, force, or crime of any kind ; but labour zea-
</p>
<p>" lously and faithfully for the liberation of our native country from

<p>" or violence of any kind ; free from the stain of bigotry or intoler-

</p>
<p>11 Actuated by the most generous feelings, we shall now only show
</p>
<p>" our determination to prove ourselves superior to those whom we
</p>
<p>" succeed." Again, hear him when he was elected Lord Mayor 
</p>
<p>hear this conspirator  hear his sentiments on the moment of his
</p>
<p>success and his triumph ; hear his sentiments when he was placed
</p>
<p>in the seat of power ; in the seat of dignity ; hear with what senti-
</p>
<p>ments he accepted that place : " If I be elected Lord Mayor of the
</p>
<p>" city of Dublin, I pledge myself to this  that in my capacity of
</p>
<p>" Lord Mayor, no one shall be able to discover from my conduct
</p>
<p> what are my politics, or of what shade are the religious tenets I
</p>
<p>" hold. In my capacity of a man, however, I am a Repealer  to my
</p>
<p>w last breath a Repealer, because I am thoroughly, honestly, con-
</p>
<p>433
</p>
<p>" scientiously convinced, that the Repeal of the Act of Union would
</p>
<p>" be fraught with the richest benefits to our common country, and
</p>
<p>" would be, in an eminent degree, calculated to advance the interests
</p>
<p>" of all classes of her Majesty's subjects in Ireland. As a man I hold
</p>
<p>" this  as a man I speak thus. But my conduct as Lord Mayor, shall
</p>
<p>" not be such as to give the slightest indication of my political bias ;
</p>
<p>" but it shall, in every instance, I trust, be characterized by tolerance
</p>
<p>" and liberality, and evidence  the strict impartiality and unswerving

<p>" its important duties, of its momentous charge, and of its practical
</p>

</p>
<p>" ardently do I hope that my own conduct, and that of the gentle-
</p>
<p>" men of my own political persuasion, with whom I am allied, may
</p>
<p>" be such as to set a glorious example to the world, of the manner
</p>
<p>" in which Irishmen, who differ widely as the poles in political prin-
</p>
<p>" ciples, and the higher points of religious belief, may yet unite toge-

<p>" ther in harmony of spirit, and perfect unanimity of purpose, and
</p>
<p>" may, with faithfulness, honesty, and truth, go hand in hand with
</p>
<p>" each other on a grand and national question, the design and motive
</p>
<p>" of which are to promote the welfare of all without distinction. I shall
</p>
<p>" certainly make it the study of my life to palliate, if not absolutely
</p>
<p>"to justify, the high eulogiums which my too kind friends have
</p>
<p>" bestowed upon me ; and there is no possible effort which I will
</p>
<p>" leave unessayed to convince those who have opposed me to-day,
</p>
<p>" that they were mistaken, most fatally mistaken, as to my impulses and

<p>" motives, and that there is no notion on the subject of the strictest

<p>" grity of purpose and of action, which they may have imagined to
</p>
<p>" themselves, that they will not find realized, to the utmost of my

<p>" we may set an example to the world, and prove that Irishmen,
</p>
<p>" discrepant though they may be, each from the other, in the quality

<p>Again, at the Association, on the 9th of March he says: " No,
</p>
<p>" there shall not be one drop of blood shed in Ireland, as long as
</p>
<p>" I live, in any political struggle whatever Man is not en-
</p>
<p>" titled to shed the blood of his fellow-creature, and the red arm of
</p>
<p>" God's vengeance falls sooner or later on the murderer. . . . During
</p>
<p>" the entire struggle for Catholic Emancipation, no man was even
</p>
<p>" charged with riot, or with the slightest offence respecting property.
</p>
<p>" . . . . Not a drop of human blood was ever mingled with our con-
</p>
<p>" test, nor is the weight of it on our souls, or the guilt of it on our
</p>
<p>" minds ; but we obtained that mighty political revolution without
</p>
<p>" crime and without bloodshed, by the incessant exertion of our con-
</p>
<p>" stitutional faculties, and by the gigantic, aye, the electric force
</p>
<p>" of public opinion, in favour of right and justice." There is that
</p>
<p>great principle, put forth in language that I am not master of; there
</p>
<p>is truly and eloquently expressed the kind of force, the kind of power
</p>
<p>by which Mr. O'Connell expected to effect the regeneration, as he
</p>
<p>conceived it to be, of his native land ; not by the pike or the gun, not
</p>
<p>by the bayonet, but by the gigantic and electric force of public opinion
</p>
<p>in favour of justice. By the aid of public opinion, now more gigan-
</p>
<p>tic than it ever has been since the creation of the world ; public opi-
</p>
<p>nion, that now means, not the opinion of any sect or party, or any
</p>
<p>county, or any province, or any kingdom, or any empire, or of any
</p>
<p>quarter of the globe  public opinion, that now means the opinion of
</p>
<p>all mankind that can think justly. It is a century since Locke, that
</p>
<p>immortal being, propounded to the world that of the three kinds of
</p>
<p>law that exist  the law of God, political law, and the law of opinion
</p>
<p>the latter had more universal influence on men's actions than the
</p>
<p>other two. That has been propounded by him eloquently, philoso-

<p>phically, and ably. Gentlemen, in his day the Press was comparatively
</p>
<p>powerless ; in his day it would have been a difficult thing to arrest
</p>
<p>the attention of any one country ; in his day mankind were carried
</p>
<p>away by a national strife, England was ignorant of what France was
</p>
<p>doino, and France was ignorant of what England was doing, and
</p>
<p>opinion was comparatively weak ; it could have no effect whatever
</p>
<p>upon the conduct of nations ; opinion was no sanction for the con-
</p>
<p>duct of nations, but not so at the present day. Gentlemen, what I
</p>
<p>am addressing to you to-day will, before to-morrow's sun rises, be at
</p>
<p>the other side of the channel. What I am to-day saying to you,
</p>
<p>what is heard by the few in this court, will before to-morrow's sun
</p>
<p>sets, pass through the mind, and be the subject of opinion of many
</p>
<p>millions of your fellow-beings ; what I am now addressing to you
</p>
<p>will be, before a second sun rises, upon the Atlantic, on its way to
</p>
<p>the New World. That, Gentlemen, is the present moral force of
</p>
<p>human opinion. Where is the Ministry, where is the Sovereign,
</p>
<p>where the body of men, aye, the nation that dare to act so as to
</p>
<p>435
</p>
<p>deserve the condemnation of public opinion ? " The Globe talked of
</p>
<p>" the absurdity of Repeal, but he would say that anything else was
</p>
<p>" absurd in comparison to it ; nothing else was safe, or calculated to
</p>
<p>u hind the two nations together in reality. A better spirit was spring-
</p>
<p>ing up amongst them, and the Catholic who would not join in a
</p>
<p>" kindly spirit to bury past offences in oblivion, was an enemy of his
</p>
<p>" country."
</p>
<p>In March, 1843, the "Memory of the Dead" was published,
</p>
<p>and in January, 1844, it has been read for you again, with well
</p>
<p>practised emphasis ; and, by-and-by, you will be told again that
</p>
<p>those who are under the guidance of Mr. O'Connell were reminded
</p>
<p>of those past atrocities, in order to stimulate them to avenge those
</p>
<p>atrocities. That is a most unfair and mistaken construction put
</p>
<p>upon this morceau of '98. See for a moment what the object he had in
</p>
<p>view was : it was to make the Irish peaceable and quiet, in the place
</p>
<p>of being a distracted, miserable, criminal, bloody-minded population,
</p>
<p>with one large section watching when they might burn the houses of
</p>
<p>their sleeping fellow-countrymen, and another section prosecuting
</p>
<p>their miserable, selfish, personal advantages, at the expense of all good
</p>
<p>feeling. And for this purpose it was necessary to remind the inha-
</p>
<p>bitants in the strongest, most energetic, and emphatic language, of
</p>
<p>the woes and misfortunes brought upon their ancestors by having
</p>
<p>recourse to physical force. Now, take that as a clue to " remember
</p>
<p>'98." Remember the fathers of families having lost their lives at
</p>
<p>their own doors. Remember the outrages upon humanity that were
</p>
<p>perpetrated. Remember they arose from insurrection. Let the
</p>
<p>blood stand in your remembrance ; but remember to avoid the mis-
</p>
<p>take. Is it a crime to remember that those poor victims fell from
</p>
<p>their errors ? Does not the common feeling of mankind pity the
</p>
<p>unfortunate victim of mistake, and separate him from others who
</p>
<p>have suffered for their crimes? Is the memory of the man to be
</p>
<p>forgotten for whom it was written :
</p>
<p>" There came to the beach a poor exile from Erin,
</p>
<p>The dew on his thin robe was heavy and chill

</p>
<p>for his country he sighed, whilst by twilight repairing
</p>
<p>To wander alone by the wind-beaten hill."
</p>
<p>Who was he whose memory was rescued from oblivion by the poet,
</p>
<p>and preserved for the respect and pity of mankind ? Was not he a rebel
</p>
<p>of '98? I wonder it did not enter into the memory of the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General, that the author of these lines enjoys a pension to this hour,
</p>
<p>and that it came from the suggestion of Queen Caroline, the consort
</p>
<p>of George IV. Was it not necessary to remind the living of the
</p>
<p>crimes and errors of the dead ? If the living were to be converted
</p>
<p>into a nation from a barbarous faction, it was necessary to remind
</p>
<p>them that they were by descent entitled to be noble, and to remind
</p>
<p>them of the bravery of their ancestors in battle ? When they were
</p>
<p>to refrain from physical force and moral power it was necessary, too,
</p>
<p>to remind them that their ancestors had been the victims of treachery,
</p>
<p>of the breach of faith in past times ; not to stimulate the millions to
</p>
<p>massacre for the dead (it is unfair to make that use of it), but to in-
</p>
<p>duce them to avoid their errors.
</p>
<p>436
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, some allusions have been made to the communications
</p>
<p>from America, as if that country were looked to for aid in a physical
</p>
<p>contest ; but I will read for you what was said by Mr. O'Connell at a
</p>
<p>meeting of the Association on the 15th of November, 1841. " We
</p>
<p>" are told that it is nothing less than treason for us to receive
</p>
<p>" such support as this from America! Why it is the very contrary
</p>
<p>" of treason. It would be treason were we to co-operate with the
</p>
<p>" Americans against the peace of England, and inspire them with
</p>
<p>" feelings hostile to the well-being of this empire ; but we do the
</p>
<p>" very contrary  we inspire them instead with respect and regard
</p>
<p>" for the Constitution of Great Britain  we invite them to sympa-
</p>
<p>" thise with us in a struggle for our rights, by means consistent with,
</p>
<p>u and under the sanction of that Constitution .... It was right that
</p>
<p>( f he should first observe, that the enrolment of the gentlemen as
</p>
<p>" volunteers, mentioned in that letter, was a circumstance which
</p>
<p>" took place in America, and was not of course connected with the
</p>
<p>11 proceedings of that Association, which was not at liberty to enrol
</p>
<p>" any members unless they were British subjects." [See how Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell guards with the anxiety of a parent that Association from
</p>
<p>the possibility of being considered an illegal association]. " In his
</p>
<p>" opinion, whatever might be that of others, Repeal was the only
</p>
<p>" means to prevent the total separation which they appeared so
</p>
<p>" much to dread .... They sought for Repeal as the only resource
</p>
<p>" against separation .... Some men there were who held that, the
</p>
<p>" differences of various religions could not be discussed without
</p>
<p>*' producing animosity and ill-will in society  but this he denied.
</p>
<p>" A man might converse on the differences between his own tenets
</p>
<p>" and those of his neighbour, as he might converse on the colour
</p>
<p>" of a horse ; but that man was of no religion who would bear
</p>
<p>" ill-will to his neighbour, or persecute and oppress him, because
</p>
<p>" of that difference. Such a man might call himself a Catholic, a
</p>
<p>" Protestant, or a Presbyterian, but this, at least, was certain, that
</p>
<p>" he was no Christian. He was rather a blasphemer, who set all re-
</p>
<p>" ligion at defiance, and broke through the primary obligation of

</p>
<p>" Christianity, which enjoins that we should do unto others as we
</p>
<p>" would desire to be done by." Again, on the 14th Nov. 1841, he
</p>
<p>says : " If, in these communications, there was to be found any in-
</p>
<p>" citement towards sedition, or any remonstrances that they should
</p>
<p>" look for the attainment of their national rights by means turbulent
</p>
<p>" or unconstitutional, then, indeed, they would be compelled, however
</p>
<p>" unwillingly, to repudiate any support or countenance from men
</p>
<p>" who could hold such language. But the Americans knew how
</p>
<p>" to estimate and appreciate the motives of the Irish people.
</p>
<p>" They felt assured that Ireland had resolved to carry out the
</p>
<p>" great objects which she proposed to herself by moral and peace-
</p>
<p>" able means alone  by the accumulation of public opinion  by the
</p>
<p>" combination of the good and true-hearted of every denomina-
</p>
<p>" tion  by uniting all Ireland in one sentiment of good will and una-
</p>
<p>" nimity  in one unalterable determination to succeed in establishing
</p>
<p>" the legislative independence of their native country. . . . They
</p>
<p>" had not challenged the kind feelings of the Americans, nor invited
</p>
<p>437
</p>
<p>"their sympathy; they had sent no missionary amongst them, nor
</p>
<p>" had any stimulant been had recourse to to excite their enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>u   . . Let it not be said by any that their object was to excite a spi-
</p>
<p>" rit of hostility to England. Far from it ; the Americans were fully
</p>
<p>" sensible of this fact, that nothing could be better calculated to con-
</p>
<p>" solidate the power and influence of England than the achievement
</p>
<p>"of Repeal. They knew that the faithful heart and ready arm of
</p>
<p>" Ireland were the best strong-stays of England in all her quarrels and
</p>
<p>" distresses, and that by no measure could such defences be more
</p>
<p>" readily assured than by the conceding of our national independence.
</p>
<p>"... He did not know what they ever got from England when she
</p>
<p>" was strong ; but he knew that they had got a great deal from her
</p>
<p>" when she was in distress, and that she would not be long in distress
</p>
<p>" when she would do them justice, and then she would increase her
</p>
<p>" strength and make herself powerful." .... Mr. O'Connell has fre-
</p>
<p>quently, unhesitatingly asserted, that the concessions of justice by
</p>
<p>England to Ireland have invariably been obtained in the hour of
</p>
<p>England's danger and distresses; and what treason, let me ask you,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, was there in making such an assertion? Do you not all
</p>
<p>know that it is true  literally true? It is a matter of history ; and
</p>
<p>some of you may still have it in your memories that in the year
</p>
<p>1792, when Mr. Egan brought into the Irish House of Commons a
</p>
<p>petition for the Emancipation of the Catholics, the petition would
</p>
<p>not be entertained or discussed ; but before that year had passed over
</p>
<p>England was embarrassed with difficulties  she was environed with
</p>
<p>state perils, and that very bill passed the House of Commons. But
</p>
<p>mark what use Mr. O'Connell makes of the fact : "That should not,
</p>
<p>" however, lessen his allegiance, or diminish his respect and attach-
</p>
<p>" ment to the admirable young Queen that holds the throne of these
</p>
<p>" realms. He thought she possessed a superiority of judgment and
</p>
<p>" intellect to any person of her own sex that he ever knew. She had
</p>
<p>" evinced a more honest-hearted and friendly disposition towards
</p>
<p>" this country than any British monarch that had preceded her ; and
</p>
<p>" therefore, he was anxious to secure the stability of the Throne on

<p>" the basis of the prosperity of all her people. . . . He wished to give
</p>
<p>" to England the most powerful ally that she had ever had  the gene-
</p>
<p>" rous hearts and ready arms of Ireland ; and he was struggling for the
</p>
<p>" Repeal of the Union, that she might command both the one and
</p>
<p>" the other The frightful and appalling crimes in this country
</p>
<p>" were the assassinations that took place in revenge for those clear-
</p>
<p>" ances. That fearful crime, at which every feeling man shudders, at
</p>
<p>" which every good man weeps, against which every religious man ex-
</p>
<p>" claims  that crime which was visited with the deserved punishment
</p>
<p>" of death, and over the perpetrators of which the red arm of God's
</p>
<p>" vengeance was suspended  resulted from that system. But they
</p>
<p>" were not to be palliated or mitigated on that account. They were
</p>
<p>" murders foul and horrible, and they brought disgrace and calamity
</p>
<p>" on the country." Gentlemen, is there a man amongst you who can
</p>
<p>put his hand upon his breast, and declare that he, in his conscience,
</p>
<p>believes that the man who uttered such language as this had
</p>
<p>any sympathies in connexion with the dagger-men and the torch-
</p>
<p>438
</p>
<p>men ? No ; surely there is no man who will say that any sympathy
</p>
<p>could have existed between them, for what tongue could have held up
</p>
<p>to public scorn in more burning language of eloquent detestation than

</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I am come to a meeting of the Association on the
</p>
<p>20th December, 1841. Mr. O'Connell spoke at that meeting, and,
</p>
<p>in alluding to the countenance and co-operation which the Associa-
</p>
<p>tion was in the habit of receiving from the Repealers in America, ex-
</p>
<p>pressed himself in the following language. He said : " The Associa-
</p>
<p>" tion had no delegate, and he would add, never will have a delegate in
</p>
<p>" America. They had no objects in view which would render it ne-
</p>
<p>" cessary for them to have a delegate in any foreign or independent
</p>
<p>" country. Their American friends did not assume that they had
</p>
<p>" any desire or intention of breaking their allegiance to the Crown,
</p>
<p>" or disconnecting themselves with the Government of Great Britain.
</p>
<p>"... The Americans advised them to continue in the peaceable
</p>
<p>" course of agitation in which they had commenced, but at the same
</p>
<p>" time to persevere to the end. They pressed on them the propriety
</p>
<p>" of avoiding all approach to violent revolution, and they did not re-
</p>
<p>" quire of them to lessen their allegiance to the Throne; that alle-
</p>
<p>" giance which is as pure and unimpeachable now as it had been always.
</p>
<p>" If they gave any other advice, the Irish nation would spurn their
</p>
<p>" assistance with disdain ; but no, they encourage them to obey the
</p>
<p>" laws, and to revere the Constitution. . . . Let him not be misun-
</p>
<p>" derstood ; what he said was, that they sought the same principle
</p>
<p>" which the Americans did of self-legislation, but they were distin-
</p>
<p>" guished completely from the Americans in their mode of action in
</p>
<p>" working that principle out, and while the Americans carried theirs
</p>
<p>" to a total separation, the people of Ireland were determined to
</p>
<p>" adhere with inalienable loyalty to the Crown of Great Britain.
</p>
<p>" The cause of Ireland was like that of America in the principle
</p>
<p>" of self-legislation. In other respects they differed ; but it was on
</p>
<p>" that account not the less sacred with them, for being free from vio-

</p>
<p>" lence and crime, turbulence and bloodshed."
</p>
<p>Such is the language of the man who is now arraigned before you-
</p>
<p>as a conspirator  -as one who designed, by bloody and violent means,
</p>
<p>to subvert the law and trample on the constitution ! And now, Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, let me ask you, is this principle of self-legislation, alluded to by
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, a thing so obviously wrong, so obviously contrary to
</p>
<p>the well-being of your country, so obviously at variance with common
</p>
<p>sense and common justice, that the question is never to be discussed?
</p>
<p>Is it so clear, so plain, that the man is nothing but a conspirator who
</p>
<p>disputes that a Parliament, five-sixths of whose members are men
</p>
<p>who are in as blissful a state of ignorance as to the real state and
</p>
<p>condition of Ireland as was Mr. Ross, whose opinion of your coun-
</p>
<p>trymen, was such that he would not take 50,000 to come over
</p>
<p>here avowedly in the character of a Government Reporter. Mr.
</p>
<p>Ross was connected with the public Press, and was so circumstanced
</p>
<p>that he had fully as good an opportunity of becoming acquainted with
</p>
<p>the state of Ireland as five-sixths of the members of the Imperial Le-
</p>
<p>439
</p>
<p>gislature ; and yet are they properly qualified to legislate for Ireland ?
</p>
<p>For my part, seeing- the state of ignorance that exists in the English
</p>
<p>mind towards the people of this country, I ceased to be surprised at
</p>
<p>the extraordinary Statutes which have been passed for this country,
</p>
<p>Statutes which would otherwise challenge my unqualified amaze-
</p>
<p>ment ; I cease to be astonished that a Poor Law should be devised for
</p>
<p>Ireland, the operation and intent of which is to catch the starving
</p>
<p>poor, and treat them as animals who are not to be killed, but whom it
</p>
<p>is proper to confine in prisons where they are to be fed and clothed
</p>
<p>at the expense of those who, as yet, have not arrived at the same state
</p>
<p>of pauperism as themselves. I also cease to be surprised why a law
</p>
<p>should be enacted which renders it imperative on me to get a brand
</p>
<p>and mark upon an old rusty gun, whose last act was to shoot a White-
</p>
<p>boy, and upon a shattered rusty brass blunderbuss, which performed
</p>
<p>a similar exploit some twenty-five years ago. Since then they have
</p>
<p>been lying in a damp cellar of mine mouldering with rust, and there
</p>
<p>is no alternative left to me but that either I must abandon my profes-
</p>
<p>sional pursuits for a considerable period, while I get them branded, or
</p>
<p>else that I must give them to my servant with directions to pitch them
</p>
<p>over the Liffey wall into the river. But to return to the topic on
</p>
<p>which I was addressing you. A great moral demonstration of the
</p>
<p>Irish people was to be. What was meant by a moral demonstration?
</p>
<p>The human family was to be shown that the people of Ireland, although
</p>
<p>they were once criminally divided, although they were once crimi-
</p>
<p>nally armed one against the other, although they were once a drunken,
</p>
<p>besotted, contemptible set of savages, that although they were all this
</p>
<p>at one period, they could be reformed into a nation, and a moral,
</p>
<p>peaceable people. Has that moral demonstration been made ? Has
</p>
<p>it been made in all quarters of the country, amongst men of all ranks,
</p>
<p>amongst men of all professions ; and has it been achieved by the very
</p>
<p>agitation which is now going on through the land ? Gentlemen, this
</p>
<p>is a question well worthy your serious consideration. Mr. Hughes
</p>
<p>came over to this country as a stranger, who never set his foot upon
</p>
<p>Irish soil before. He arrived the day before the Mullaghmast meet-

<p>ing took place, in the unfavourable and unpopular character of a Go-
</p>
<p>vernment spy. Mr. Hughes being, as you have all witnessed, a man
</p>
<p>of sense, a man of fortitude, a man of firmness, a man of intelligence,
</p>
<p>he came here without any difficulty. He takes the road for his des-
</p>
<p>tination on an outside car at night, and he travels from Dublin to
</p>
<p>Mullaghmast, and he arrives safe at the end of his journey. No man
</p>
<p>molests him. In the morning he proceeds to the platform, where the
</p>
<p>meeting was to be held, and he arrives there before Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>arrived, whose protection, perhaps, he might have required. He in-
</p>
<p>timates that he is present as a Government reporter. He at once
</p>
<p>confesses himself and declares the nature of his mission ; and how is
</p>
<p>he received ? Every accommodation is given to him to take his notes,
</p>
<p>to take down fully and perfectly everything he shall observe, every-
</p>
<p>thing he sees and hears. He is not unknown, and vet does his pre-
</p>
<p>sence express or mitigate the strength of the language, or the strength
</p>
<p>of the resolutions which were previously arranged for that meeting ?
</p>
<p>440 *
</p>
<p>Now, if insurrection or rebellion was in their minds, I don't think you
</p>
<p>can reasonably suppose that they would not have altered their course
</p>
<p>a little. Well, Mr. Hughes is not interrupted in any shape, nor is
</p>
<p>there any obstruction offered to his taking ample notes of what he sees
</p>
<p>and hears. There is to be a dinner the same day after the meeting.
</p>
<p>Is he allowed to make his way in the best manner he can to it ? Is
</p>
<p>he allowed to go through the jostling, and, perhaps, the hostility he
</p>
<p>might fear to be exposed to ? No such thing. He gets an invitation
</p>
<p>there ; he is placed as a guest at the table ; he is treated as a gen-
</p>
<p>tleman, and allowed to enjoy the hospitality of the enemy. We did
</p>
<p>not hear that there was any sneer at him, anything said or done from
</p>
<p>which he could infer the smallest disrespect towards himself. When
</p>
<p>the cloth was removed, he is supplied with pen, ink, and paper, to
</p>
<p>take down what might be said by those present, after their hearts
</p>
<p>were warmed by the enjoyments of the table. He does take it down,
</p>
<p>and he remains there until a late hour at night. Then he proceeds
</p>
<p>to return to Dublin, but does not ask Mr. O'Connell for any protec-
</p>
<p>tion. He had seen the great moral demonstration of the people ; after
</p>
<p>viewing the mighty magnitude of two hundred and fifty thousand
</p>
<p>men, he could not discover among them anything tending to violence,
</p>
<p>crime, insolence, or inhumanity. His heart is fearless, for confidence
</p>
<p>is begotten by this great moral demonstration of the Irish people, and
</p>
<p>he takes his open car on the public road, accompanied only by his
</p>
<p>English friend, both known to be persons who had been sent there to
</p>
<p>take down what passed, and afterwards perhaps to prove it. We heard
</p>
<p>of no insolence being offered to him ; nothing of the sort. They travelled
</p>
<p>back in perfect safety without it. He took his notes in a book, and
</p>
<p>no one attempted to take it from him ; he is allowed to cross the
</p>
<p>Channel just as he came over. This is the way in which Mr. Bond
</p>
<p>Hughes was treated by the people, while he was acting in the capa-
</p>
<p>city of a Government informer. He crosses the Channel again, and
</p>
<p>comes over here to be a witness in these State prosecutions against
</p>
<p>the idol of this people. He swears his informations, and he makes
</p>
<p>a great mistake in them ; and there are circumstances which

</p>
<p>attach to this mistake which might give it the appearance of being
</p>
<p>otherwise than unintentional. The first emotion of the man af-
</p>
<p>fected by it was to institute a prosecution against Mr. Hughes ; and
</p>
<p>steps were taken with that view. Mr. Hughes was accused, and yet
</p>
<p>he came upon that table to stand the cross-examination of the Irish
</p>
<p>bar with that impeachment, with that presumed blot upon his charac-
</p>
<p>ter; he was to be cross-examined by members of that bar, who, per-
</p>
<p>haps, are not remarkable for keeping terms with their opponents. He
</p>
<p>was cross-examined before you. And was there one single question
</p>
<p>put to him affecting his character, or importing that he was not a gen-
</p>
<p>tleman in the fullest sense of the word ? Was there a question asked
</p>
<p>him which could throw odium upon him ? He read from his notes
</p>
<p>his admirable report, his accurate report; he deported himself like a
</p>
<p>man of truth and honesty, and in the course of his examination there
</p>
<p>was not a question put to him which could hurt his feelings, or which
</p>
<p>could be otherwise than grateful to him. Is not that a great moral
</p>
<p>441
</p>
<p>demonstration in Ireland ? Who can deny it ? If as Mr. O'Connell,
</p>
<p>then, failed in any degree in first making, and then proclaiming to the
</p>
<p>world, that the Irish people were an honest, a sober, a virtuous, and
</p>
<p>an inoffensive people ? Your verdict cannot take away the effect of
</p>
<p>that demonstration from the eyes of mankind. Whatever may be the
</p>
<p>event of this trial  I cannot say that I am not anxious about it  but
</p>
<p>whatever may be its event, Ireland has got a place in the history
</p>
<p>of nations, and in the opinion of mankind, which it is not in the
</p>
<p>power of any verdict, or any judgment, or any punishment, to take away.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, at a Repeal meeting at Kells,onthe27th Dec, 1841, Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell again says : "The Queen, long life to her, who was the sincere
</p>
<p>" friend of Ireland, was at least free, but she was then a prisoner in her
</p>
<p>" own palace. From his heart he hoped she might be delivered from
</p>
<p>" the hands of her enemies, and allowed to act as the impulse of her
</p>
<p>" own generous heart should dictate They wanted not to sepa-
</p>
<p>" rate from England; they wished not that the golden link of the
</p>
<p>" Crown should be broken, or their true and undivided allegiance dis-
</p>
<p>" turbed, which they owed to one of the best Monarchs that ever
</p>
<p>" governed the British empire It had been said that Repeal
</p>
<p>" would sever the connexion between the countries; he denied it;
</p>
<p>" there lived not a man who felt a purer or a more devoted allegiance
</p>
<p>" to his Sovereign than he did, and the more particularly because the
</p>
<p>" possessor of that Crown was a lovely and an amiable woman, and
</p>
<p>" the first of her family desirous of doing good to Ireland. She was
</p>
<p>" a Sovereign who, with manly intrepidity, kept the advocates of bi-
</p>
<p>" go try and intolerance from power for twelve months, and may God
</p>
<p>" in heaven bless her for doing so. Nay, so far from Repeal pro-
</p>
<p>" ducing separation, he was firmly convinced the calamity so much
</p>
<p>" dreaded would take place unless the Repeal of the Union were
</p>
<p>" granted." Here is the sentence Jackson has misrepresented, but
</p>
<p>whether from design or not it is not necessary for me to say. He
</p>
<p>underwent a very searching cross-examination because he did repre-
</p>
<p>sent himself as a Reporter, which he was not ; he was not qualified to
</p>
<p>take notes. I only assailed his accuracy. I know nothing of a wit-

</p>
<p>ness except on the table. Here is what Jackson says was spoken by
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell: " 1 know such a struggle will not take place while I
</p>
<p>" live, but after my death it is not an improbable nor an undesirable
</p>
<p>" result." It will be proved Mr. O'Connell did not use these words :
</p>
<p>the words he used were : " While he lived there should be no out-
</p>
<p>" break ; there should be no crime or violence of any kind. But
</p>
<p>" when he passed from this mortal stage, when he finished his earthly
</p>
<p>" career, and that, in the common course of nature, should soon take
</p>
<p>" place, if the Union were to continue, it would, perhaps, be found
</p>
<p>" that an outbreak could hardly be prevented in order to dissever the
</p>
<p>" connexion. It was therefore that he struggled to perpetuate it ; it
</p>
<p>" was therefore that he wished they should be the fellow-subjects of
</p>
<p>" England  her equals, but not her slaves  bound together by the
</p>
<p>" golden link of the Crown, but governed by her own domestic Par-
</p>
<p>" liament He would have them to recollect * that he who com-
</p>
<p>3l
</p>
<p>442
</p>
<p>" milted a crime strengthened the enemy.' He warned them against
</p>
<p>" secret societies, and the more so because there was no necessity in
</p>
<p>" taking an oath, inasmuch as if the act were good there was no ne-
</p>
<p>" cessity for concealing it. Where was the man who, when he per-
</p>
<p>" formed an act of charity or benevolence, wished that it should be
</p>
<p>" concealed? and thus the nature of these secret societies proved
</p>
<p>" that the intentions for which they were established were bad in
</p>
<p>" themselves." It will be proved to your entire satisfaction that Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell never used the words set down for him by Mr. Jackson.
</p>
<p>Why, the words are flat, stale, clumsy. It was not like the manly and
</p>
<p>lofty style of Mr. O'Connell ; it was not what he would speak, nor was he
</p>
<p>guilty of speaking it. Mr. O'Connell never faltered, he never stopped ;
</p>
<p>when at the top of the ladder his eloquence never flagged ; no one ever
</p>
<p>heard him utter such a sentence. Let me ask you, was there any treason
</p>
<p>in what Mr. O'Connell did speak ? Was there any foul conspiracy in
</p>
<p>those sentiments? And yet, there is the conspiracy for you of which
</p>
<p>he stands charged in the indictment, the essence of which is, that he
</p>
<p>was guilty of being a member of a criminal and traitorous association ;
</p>
<p>and yet this was the language which he used to the people of Ireland
</p>
<p>the next day at the Association : " What he then said would
</p>
<p>" pass through the papers, and the people would be assured through-
</p>
<p>" out the land that the Association condemned nothing, and that
</p>
<p>" he condemned nothing so much as the system of administer-
</p>
<p>" ing illegal oaths, or forming secret societies. There was no-
</p>
<p>" thing which he abhorred with more conscientious detestation
</p>
<p>" than illegal oaths. They were in every respect and in every
</p>
<p>" instance illegal. They were even worse than illegal, for they
</p>
<p>" were highly criminal; besides which, they were not binding. An
</p>
<p>" illegal oath did not bind the villain who took it. It might bind the
</p>
<p>"man of mistaken conscientiousness, but it would not bind the vil-
</p>
<p>" lain. The man of conscientious feeling should not take such oaths,
</p>
<p>" and it was infinitely better for him to show his honesty by mak-
</p>
<p>" ing a stand against it in the first place than by adhering to it af-
</p>
<p>" terwards. He would call on the Irish people from that spot to make

</p>
<p>" a stand against taking any illegal oaths They should recollect
</p>
<p>" the motto of the Association, that ' the man who commits a crime
</p>
<p>" gives strength to the enemy.' There was, in fact, but one magic
</p>
<p>" for always succeeding in politics, and that was, being always per-
</p>
<p>" fectly right, and thus compelling your opponents to be in the
</p>
<p>" wrong I wish my recommendation to be perfectly under-
</p>
<p>" stood. I announced it yesterday, and I repeat it to-day  let the
</p>
<p>" people bring any wretch who attempts to cajole them into taking
</p>
<p>" illegal oaths before the magistrates The Repealers could
</p>
<p>" have no connexion with any illegal societies. They only wanted
</p>
<p>" the Repeal of an Act of Parliament, and they could never obtain
</p>
<p>" that object by violent means, and he was glad they could not. They
</p>
<p>" could only effect their object by constitutional means, and by not
</p>
<p>" putting themselves in the power of their enemies by doing an illegal
</p>
<p>act There breathed not in these dominions a single man
</p>
<p>443
</p>
<p>" whose heart was fuller than his with feelings of the most devoted
</p>
<p>" and inviolable allegiance, and there was no man who valued more
</p>
<p>" highly the British connexion. . . . He sympathized for his So-
</p>
<p>" vereign. He trusted that no danger would befal her from any
</p>
<p>" quarter; but, if the day should come when the Queen might stand
</p>
<p>" in need of the assistance of her Irish subjects, he pledged himself
</p>
<p>" in the name of that city, of which he was the chief magistrate, that
</p>
<p>" there would be strength enough in that city alone to put down the
</p>
<p>" outbreaks of active treason." Such is the language made use of,
</p>
<p>and yet you are called on to believe and infer certain matters from
</p>
<p>passages selected from speeches made at multitudinous meetings, and
</p>
<p>delivered on the spur of the moment. Are you to infer from these
</p>
<p>that the defendants threatened the country with violence? Are you
</p>
<p>to be called on to say that the man who uttered the sentiments made
</p>
<p>use of by Mr. O'Connell, whose eloquence and whose ability were never
</p>
<p>surpassed  are you to be called on to find him guilty of a conspiracy be-
</p>
<p>cause his sentiments do everlasting credit to his countrymen and himself?
</p>
<p>Again, at the Repeal meeting at Dundalk, on the 6th Jan., 1842,
</p>
<p>he says : " If there came any one among you to entrap or decoy you by
</p>
<p>" any oath, give him up to the authorities. They only want your blood.
</p>
<p>" I put a stop to their progress in Tipperary. I heard they were
</p>
<p>" making their way into Meath, but there they were routed. Have
</p>
<p>" nothing, then, to do with Chartists or Ribbonmen. If you bring
</p>
<p>" any of these Paddy M'Kews among you, they will traffick in your
</p>
<p>" blood-money, and therefore avoid them The Queen, the
</p>
<p>" loveliest as well as the first and foremost of her sex, wept when the
</p>
<p>" enemies of -all social order and harmony were to take possession of
</p>
<p>" the places of honest politicians. She is the most accomplished
</p>
<p>" woman of her sex, God bless her ; and she is determined to have
</p>
<p>" justice done to Ireland, if she only had the power. Let the people
</p>
<p>" preserve their loyalty to the Throne unbroken ; let them maintain
</p>
<p>" an unspotted allegiance to the Crown; let there be no violence of
</p>
<p>" any kind, but let peace and good will be your watchword
</p>
<p>" 1 need not tell you to separate quietly, for you will do so yourselves ;

</p>
<p>" and let not the words I have addressed to you be lost. I intended
</p>
<p>" that they should sink deeply into your minds, and that you should
</p>
<p>" profit by them. But it was right that the Americans should know
</p>
<p>" what were the principles, what the system of action of the Irish
</p>
<p>" Repealers. Theirs was not a contest to be achieved by the sword
</p>
<p>" or the battle-axe." Here he is propounding to the whole world
</p>
<p>their system of action. Theirs was not, he said, a contest to be
</p>
<p>achieved by the sword or the battle-axe. Speaking of a contest,
</p>
<p>mind you, he says it was not a contest to be achieved by the sword or
</p>
<p>the battle-axe. You recollect the insinuation about the Irish manufac-
</p>
<p>tured cap that was symbolical of the crown that Mr. O'Connell looked
</p>
<p>for. Was it to be crowned in his grave he was ? In the whole course
</p>
<p>of his eloquence, where you find him alluding to the possibility that
</p>
<p>ifjustice to Ireland is not granted, a violent separation of the two
</p>
<p>countries may take place, he never mentions it without designating it
</p>
<p>444
</p>
<p>as one of the greatest evils that could befal both countries
</p>
<p>" They would do no violence, nor offer any outrage to human pro-
</p>
<p>" perty or to human life ; but, encouraging the arts of agriculture,
</p>
<p>" commerce, literature, everything which could improve or ennoble
</p>
<p>'* the country, they would pursue undeviatingly their onward path to
</p>
<p>" freedom, but would scorn to desecrate the sanctity of their cause by
</p>
<p>" the effusion of a single drop of human blood." Here is the
</p>
<p>man that intended civil war and bloodshed ; such a man as Homer
</p>
<p>designates " brotherless, godless, houseless," is he that is desirous of
</p>
<p>war, a wretch, an outcast, without bodily tie to mortal manor living
</p>
<p>being; without a spiritual tie to his Creator or his God; without a
</p>
<p>residence to hide his head upon earth. That is the only man who,
</p>
<p>according to the first of poets, could be fond of civil war. Is there
</p>
<p>in anything that ever was uttered by this first of his Profes-
</p>
<p>sion, aye, I will also call him the first of Irishmen, for having preached
</p>
<p>these doctrines to the people ; is there any thing in this that could
</p>
<p>link him with the wretch I have described ? " Let it not be said that
</p>
<p>" he looked for separation. No man breathed who was more anxious
</p>
<p>" than he that these two countries should be united by the golden
</p>
<p>" link of the Crown, the maintenance of which junction he looked
</p>
<p>" upon as being useful for the tranquillity and liberty of Ireland. He
</p>
<p>" was bound by allegiance to his revered, and if the term be not
</p>
<p>" deemed indecorous, he would even say, to his beloved Sovereign.
</p>
<p>" But he was only pursuing the path which his allegiance
</p>
<p>" pointed out to him, in endeavouring to re-establish the legislative
</p>
<p>" independence of Ireland, in which measure would be found the
</p>
<p>" firmest safeguard for the connexion between the countries
</p>
<p>" Entertaining as he did a feeling of affectionate respect and alle-
</p>
<p>" giance towards his Sovereign, which made him wish to preserve
</p>
<p>" to her executive that connexion, he was induced to look for
</p>
<p>" a Domestic Parliament to prevent that separation. He wished
</p>
<p>" to see Ireland leagued with England, rather than that a separate
</p>
<p>" dominion should be established; but he wished to see her under
</p>
<p>" the fostering care of her own Legislature. While he lived there

</p>
<p>" would be no separation." Again, at the Association, January 22nd,
</p>
<p>he says : " Loyal to the Queen, attached to the connexion with Eng-
</p>
<p>" land They can easily vindicate their rights to the restoration
</p>
<p>" of their native Parliament They were looking for that Re-
</p>
<p>" peal, not for the purpose of giving the Catholics any ascendancy,
</p>
<p>" but to put all classes of people, as they had a right to be, on an
</p>
<p>" equality of rights and privileges Whenever England was in
</p>
<p>" distress she cried to us for succour, and the Irish gave their
</p>
<p>" assistance He had heard, with a throb of pride and gratifi-
</p>
<p>" cation, that the first soldiers to present themselves at the muzzles
</p>
<p>" of 500 guns of the Chinese battery were the Pioyal Irish He
</p>
<p>" was the loyal man ; for he offered to England, for her protection,
</p>
<p>" eight millions of undaunted hearts  gallant, hearty, devoted. . . .
</p>
<p>" These would he give unto her; and, in return, he asked nothing more
</p>
<p>" than equal justice and equal liberty If justice were done the
</p>
<p>445
</p>
<p>" Irish people England might set the universe at defiance, if com -
</p>
<p>" bined against her No hope but a peaceful combination for
</p>
<p>" the Repeal of the Union ; that combination to be based upon a
</p>
<p>" general obedience of the law, joined with the most perfect submis-
</p>
<p>" sion to legal authority; keeping within the bounds of peace and
</p>
<p>" order ; infringing no ordinance of man ; committing no sin against
</p>
<p>" God : to be peaceable and just to all Horrible crimes had
</p>
<p>" been committed, at the recital of which human nature shuddered,
</p>
<p>" and into the provocation given to commit which he would not then
</p>
<p>" enter, because they were incapable of palliation The only
</p>
<p>" consolation which the members of that Association had was their
</p>
<p>" determination to denounce them in every possible way ; to advise
</p>
<p>" against them, and to address to the perpetrators, whoever they may
</p>
<p>" be, every sentiment of Christian feeling, which could have the
</p>
<p>" effect of deterring them from the commission of such awful crimes.
</p>
<p>" He was an apostle of that sect in politics, which held that
</p>
<p>" the dearest and highest of earthly privileges were dearly bought
</p>
<p>" at the expense of a single drop of human blood. All political ad-
</p>
<p>" vantages might, he held, be acquired by the combination of good
</p>
<p>" men ; and it was by this agency alone that they sought to succeed."
</p>
<p>Let all good men but come to one common resolution, that something
</p>
<p>is to be done for the prime giievance of the country. Let them leave
</p>
<p>it to discussion as to what that something may be ; but let all good
</p>
<p>men unite in one cry that something must be done. Let reason
</p>
<p>investigate and determine what that something is to be ; but let
</p>
<p>all good men cry out that the evil exists  that some remedy
</p>
<p>must be had to cure it. Let all thus cry aloud ; and where is
</p>
<p>the power that suppresses public opinion thus expressed?
</p>
<p>Again, at the Association, on the 4th of April, 1842, he said:
</p>
<p>" Now, nothing could be more foolish, nay, more criminal, on the
</p>
<p>" part of the Repealers, than to be engaged in any transaction where
</p>
<p>" riot took place or blood was shed. He would sooner lose the as-
</p>
<p>" sistance of the Repealers of Manchester, valuable as it was, than
</p>
<p>" be in connexion with any party who would join in tumult or out-

</p>
<p>" rage of any kind He hoped that they would nevermore
</p>
<p>" hear of anything like what occurred at Manchester Here
</p>
<p>" was the resource for Her Majesty, and Her Majesty had it in her
</p>
<p>M power to serve the Irish people ; it was in the power of the Queen
</p>
<p>" to revive the Irish Parliament;  and that Parliament was not dead
</p>
<p>"  it only slumbered The Queen (and he asserted it as a
</p>
<p>" constitutional principle) had it in her power to revive the Irish Par-
</p>
<p>" liament whenever she pleased All he wanted was the sanc-
</p>
<p>" tion of the Monarch of Ireland. The Scotch philosophers proved
</p>
<p>" the Irish to be the first amongst the human race. The Queen
</p>
<p>" should have the support of this first class. She had only to call on
</p>
<p>" them in any emergency, and she would be triumphant. . . . They
</p>
<p>" sought for nothing of a sectarian or selfish character; they wished
</p>
<p>" to do good to every man who was a sojourner in their land, no mat-

<p>" means restore her Parliament to Ireland."
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General challenged the bar of the traversers to stand
</p>
<p>up and support, if they could, the assertion here made, that the Queen
</p>
<p>could, in the exercise of her prerogative, revive the Irish Parliament,
</p>
<p>and direct her writs to the Commons of Ireland, and summon a Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment to meet in Dublin. Now, Gentlemen, do not leave out one part of
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell's sentence : that would not be fair. He says that he
</p>
<p>asserted it as a " constitutional principle." Mind he never said that he
</p>
<p>could find a case in point. He was speaking of a totally different sub-
</p>
<p>ject from that of which the Attorney-General was speaking. He was
</p>
<p>speaking of the great "constitutional principle" propounded in the
</p>
<p>Irish Parliament bySaurin,Bushe, and Plunket.What was the "consti-
</p>
<p>tutional principle propounded bythose great men ? It was that a union 
</p>
<p>an Act professing to effect a union, obtained from the Irish Parliament
</p>
<p>by bribery, by corruption, or any other unconstitutional or unjustifiable
</p>
<p>means, would be void  that the union thus obtained would be void,
</p>
<p>as being brought about by fraud which would vitiate any Act of Par-
</p>
<p>liament. Fraud will vitiate anything. Acts of Parliament were
</p>
<p>commonly passed in reference to private estates ; and if any one of
</p>
<p>these be obtained by fraud, by misrepresentation, or any sort of mal-
</p>
<p>practice, it is void ; and will it be said that that great principle was
</p>
<p>not to be attended to in the compacts of nations ? That is what Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell meant when speaking of the Act of Union as void. These
</p>
<p>great men, whose names he had mentioned, had propounded that
</p>
<p>constitutional doctrine, as applicable not to what happened before the
</p>
<p>Union, but to what would be the case if the Act of Union were passed.
</p>
<p>In the language of Plunket, the Act would be the act of a " suicide,"
</p>
<p>but it could not annihilate the immortal soul of the Irish Parliament.
</p>
<p>What does that mean i What does the immortal soul of the Irish Par-
</p>
<p>liament mean? It means the inalienable right of the Irish nation to

</p>
<p>have a Parliament of their own. Could it have meant anything else ?
</p>
<p>It could not. Mr. O'Connell then was speaking of the great con-
</p>
<p>stitutional principle; and the difference between what is called the
</p>
<p>constitutional law of the land and the detailed law of cases is
</p>
<p>precisely the same as the difference that exists between the brick-
</p>
<p>bats of which a building is made and the building itself; and
</p>
<p>many an eye that can understand the shape and size of a brick can-
</p>
<p>not comprehend a view of the entire building. The Attorney-General
</p>
<p>expressed his wonder that the Irish Parliament should speak of the
</p>
<p>Act of Union as void ; for, if it were, the Act of Catholic Emancipa-
</p>
<p>tion was void also. Mr. O'Connell never propounded such a monstrous
</p>
<p>proposition as that the United Parliament was not a valid Parliament
</p>
<p>for passing Acts ; but that, according to the constitutional principle laid
</p>
<p>down bv Locke, the parliament was elected to make laws, and not for
</p>
<p>447
</p>
<p>the purpose of selling a constitutional settlement. Do not misunder-
</p>
<p>stand Mr. O'Connell. He has been misunderstood and very grossly.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, perhaps I have fatigued you  indeed I have fatigued
</p>
<p>myself; but 1 think it necessary to read for you these extracts from
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell's speeches, lest it may hereafter he said that he was not
</p>
<p>sincere from the commencement. If I omitted them it might be said,
</p>
<p>that although Mr. O'Connell repudiated, denounced, and execrated
</p>
<p>the Chartists, he did it for the purpose of drawing around him
</p>
<p>men who were inclined for peaceful efforts ; and that although
</p>
<p>he originally held out promises of peace, yet in the end, when he
</p>
<p>had brought the multitude together, he would change his course.
</p>
<p>1 therefore, think it necessary to exhibit to you that, from the be-
</p>
<p>ginning to the end, his views and principles were the same. I will
</p>
<p>show to you what his principles were in '41, in '42, and in '43. At
</p>
<p>a meeting of the Association, held on the 11th of May, in the year
</p>
<p>1842, speaking again of the Chartists, he said : "Thank God there
</p>
<p>" was no danger at present of a war between that country [America]
</p>
<p>" and Great Britain He was glad of it, because he loved peace,
</p>
<p>" and abominated those atrocities that were perpetrated when nations
</p>
<p>" were at war with each other He wished emphatically to tell
</p>
<p>" his friends in Belfast that he did not mean they should form any
</p>
<p>" connexion with the Chartists in this country and in England. As
</p>
<p>" to the Chartists in England, they could have no communication
</p>
<p>" with them without violating the law, for such communications
</p>
<p>" would come within the rules of corresponding societies, and amount to
</p>
<p>" a violation of the law ; and as to the Chartists in this country, God
</p>
<p>" only knows where they were to be found. They might find them,
</p>
<p>" after a great deal of labour, like a needle in a bundle of straw, and,
</p>
<p>" when found, they would not be worth the trouble of looking for them.
</p>
<p>" He wished that to be particularly known. He heard that in Belfast
</p>
<p>" some of those Chartists had made an harangue at a Repeal meeting.
</p>
<p>" He trusted in future they would be allowed to hold their own meetings
</p>
<p>" wherever they pleased, but that the Repealers should have no con-
</p>
<p>" nexion with them He could not think of anything more awful

<p><; than those agrarian disturbances ; he was there to condemn them; he
</p>
<p>" was thereto proclaim them to be crimes incapable of mitigation, and
</p>
<p>" deserving of the severest punishment ; he was there to repeat, with his
</p>
<p>" humble and profane lips, that doom which God, who wouldjudge them
</p>
<p>" all, would pronounce against the slaughterer of his fellow-creature.
</p>
<p>" He was there to alarm the conscience, if he could, of Ireland. He was
</p>
<p>" there to arouse all that was good and virtuous in the land, to the sup-
</p>
<p>" pression, by any means  he meant by honest, and fair, and leal
</p>
<p>" means  of this dreadful crime Their rulers ought in time to
</p>
<p>" conciliate the true-hearted and loyal people of Ireland. The time
</p>
<p>" might come when it would be necessary to call on them to support the
</p>
<p>'* Crown and the institutions of thecountry; and if the day should come,
</p>
<p>" he would not be wanting  his arm was as strong as ever it was, and
</p>
<p>" he had no doubt that even in England he would effect such anorgani-
</p>
<p>" zation as would save the country from any revolutionary movement.
</p>
<p>448
</p>
<p>" They would set the example of a peaceful, but still loyal and
</p>
<p>" firm organization of the people; and, whilst they revered liberty, and
</p>
<p>" were attached to religion, still they would respect the opinions of every
</p>
<p>" human being in existence He would pursue that moral and
</p>
<p>" legal course, which, while effecting great radical changes, would give
</p>
<p>' no man cause to tremble, with regard to any interference with life,
</p>
<p>" liberty, or property. The social circle, and the bonds that tied society
</p>
<p>" together, would be undisturbed  no violence would be committed, or
</p>
<p>" injury done to any human being ; on the contrary, every man's con-
</p>
<p>" dition in the country would be benefited, and prosperity and happiness
</p>
<p>" would be universal Great revolutions would be accomplished
</p>
<p>" without the shedding of one drop of blood. He was the disciple of
</p>
<p>" that new political religion which taught the lesson that moral power
</p>
<p>" was amply sufficient to accomplish the liberties of mankind  that there
</p>
<p>" would never be a necessity to fight for them It would be Her
</p>
<p>" Majesty's prerogative to order the writs to be issued to call again to-
</p>
<p>" getherin College-green that Parliament which had no power to annibi-
</p>
<p>" late itself. Her Majesty could again summon the Irish House of
</p>
<p>" Commons to meet for the despatch of Irish business, and turn the
</p>
<p>" money-changers out of the temple of the Constitution Whilst
</p>
<p>" they sought the inalienable right to legislate for themselves, they
</p>
<p>" would maintain with fidelity the British connexion." British con-
</p>
<p>nexion ! Is that treason? Is that sedition? Is that a proof of the
</p>
<p>dark conspiracy you were told of? What !  " Her Majesty could
</p>
<p>again summon the Irish House of Commons to meet." Is he wrong-
</p>
<p>in law? If he be, is that a crime ? Is it a crime that he advanced in
</p>
<p>1842 the opinions so eloquently expressed by others in the year 1800?
</p>
<p>Assuming it to be wrong  to be absurd  the question here is, is it
</p>
<p>evidence to you that a criminal conspiracy was formed by him? Never,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, let it out of your minds for one instant that that is the
</p>
<p>narrow issue you have to try here. Again, on the si 6th of May, at a
</p>
<p>Repeal meeting: " He was one of those who led no man into scenes
</p>
<p>" of violence, of outrage, or of blood  no movement of his tended in

<p>" She [England] has got one friend  one, too, who will be loyal and
</p>
<p>" brave in her defence, and that is Ireland His struggle was
</p>
<p>" not for any religious ascendancy in the land, it was no struggle for
</p>
<p>" any religious sect or persuasion ; but, with the blessing of heaven,
</p>
<p>" for the entire people of Ireland  for the Catholic, Protestant, and
</p>
<p>" Presbyterian  all of whom were equally interested, and would de-

<p>" rive the same benefits, could they be but induced to give up their

<p>" dissensions, and become true Irishmen Never until he ap-
</p>
<p>" peared had they had a leader who was resolved not to suffer them to

<p>M come into danger, or kept them religiously within the bounds of law
</p>
<p>" and order." Whether in the open air, or under a roof, you always
</p>
<p>find him consistent, throwing contempt on physical force, and eulo-
</p>
<p>gising and panegyrizing a peaceful and moral course.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, Mr. O'Connell has been abused for raising prejudices
</p>
<p>449
</p>
<p>against men of property ; has anything been read to you which could
</p>
<p>tend to such a conclusion. I will now read to you an extract of his
</p>
<p>speech, made at a meeting of St. Paul's Ward, on the 18th May, 1842.
</p>
<p>" He need hardly tell them that he would not advise any man to pursue
</p>
<p>" a line of conduct that could, by possibility, do him the slightest injury.
</p>
<p>" He would not allow property to be interfered with, violence com-
</p>
<p>" mitted, or the social circle disturbed. He would cause the people
</p>
<p>" to proceed morally, peaceably, and constitutionally. He was not
</p>
<p>" seeking to obtain any selfish or sectarian purpose. The object he
</p>
<p>" had in view would be equally beneficial to all ; and, if Irishmen of
</p>
<p>" every class and creed studied their own interests, they would unite
</p>
<p>" with him to make their common country prosperous and happy. . . .
</p>
<p>" He would take care that the Irish people should, in all their move-
</p>
<p>" ments, keep within the bounds of the law, and the spirit oftheCon-
</p>
<p>" stitution." And at the Association, May 2 1st, 1842, he says:
</p>
<p>" They did not concur in any conduct that was violent, oroutrageous,
</p>
<p>" or illegal  the way they looked for liberty for themselves, and the
</p>
<p>" only way they would suggest to look for it, was by peaceable and
</p>
<p>" constitutional efforts, embodying the strength of public opinion, and
</p>
<p>" a total abstinence from any violation of the law, or outrage against
</p>
<p>" morality But in this, as the former document, there were
</p>
<p>" some expressions which he would prefer to have left out. They
</p>
<p>" [the Americans] were mistaken in the allusions which they made as
</p>
<p>'.' to the possibility of the Repeal cause ending in separation. No; on
</p>
<p>" the contrary, he was convinced that the Repeal agitation was the only
</p>
<p>" thing which would bind Ireland to England, and that the expecta-
</p>
<p>" tion of Repeal was the feeling which would prevent separation.
</p>
<p>" Certainly, if the time should come when those who now possessed an
</p>
<p>" influence over the Irish mind would have passed away and gone to
</p>
<p>" their reckoning, and younger and more ardent and anxious persons
</p>
<p>" appear on the public stage, in this case he had not the least doubt
</p>
<p>" that if Repeal was not granted, separation would, in all probability,
</p>
<p>" be the consequence. It was not in the nature of things that the
</p>
<p>" connexion, as it stood at present, could continue The Ameri-

</p>
<p>" cans were wrong in thinking the present Repeal agitation would end
</p>
<p>" in any violent struggle. The Repealers would violate no law ; they
</p>
<p>" were proceeding constitutionally, as well as legally, taking care to
</p>
<p>" keep within the bounds of law and morality, and do no act but that
</p>
<p>" of which every good and virtuous man could approve, and ivhich
</p>
<p>" God would be pleased to sanction The Irish did not mean
</p>
<p>" to obtain Repeal by the commission of a single crime, and, of course,
</p>
<p>" they would not sanction a different course by others There
</p>
<p>" was no danger of civil war ; there would never be a civil war in Ire-
</p>
<p>" land again The Irish people did not look for aid from any
</p>
<p>" mortal power, or to an outbreak at home, that would destroy all the
</p>
<p>"elements of society, carry devastation in its ruin, and mark the
</p>
<p>" downfall of the state where it occurred." It is not treason he wants,
</p>
<p>not the men of Wexford, as insinuated  but the strength of public opi-
</p>
<p>nion. " I can tell them [the impracticables] we will not go to war with
</p>
<p>3M
</p>
<p>450
</p>
<p>" England ; we would not take the greatest benefit that could be
</p>
<p>" conferred upon us at the expense of one drop of human blood.
</p>
<p>" There shall be no crime, no outrage, no injury of person or pro-
</p>
<p>" perty ; our agitation must be peaceable, legal, and constitutional.
</p>
<p>" We will petition the Queen to come to her loyal, faithful,
</p>
<p>" and devoted Irish subjects ; and once the Queen sets her foot in
</p>
<p>" Ireland, she can call the Irish Parliament together, she has the
</p>
<p>" power vested in her of issuing writs for the purpose So when
</p>
<p>" the Queen comes to Ireland the Irish Parliament will be revived."
</p>
<p>Again, at the Association, on the 15th August, 1842: " Ireland
</p>
<p>" continued tranquil, firm, and determined in seeking for an ame-
</p>
<p>" lioration of her wretched condition, determined to have recourse to
</p>
<p>" none but peaceable means, which would be justifiable in the eyes
</p>
<p>" of Providence, and calculated to honour themselves in the opinion
</p>
<p>{' of all human beings Their duty to the Queen, their alle-
</p>
<p>" giance to the Sovereign, as well as their wish to have prosperity
</p>
<p>" extended to her subjects, demanded that they should proclaim their
</p>
<p>" determination to agitate peaceably for a reform in the Commons
</p>
<p>" House of Parliament The people of Ireland would engage
</p>
<p>" in no rebellion, in no violence, anarchy, and strife; but they would
</p>
<p>" join in every peaceable effort that may be made to procure for the
</p>
<p>" people their just rights With the blessing of God, and the
</p>
<p>" aid of good men, they would achieve the Repeal  without a crime,
</p>
<p>" for they would never be a party to any crime. They would achieve
</p>
<p>" it without rousing a single particle of bad feeling or party ani-
</p>
<p>" mosity. They would be no parties to religious persecutions or
</p>
<p>" religious distinctions between Irishman and Irishman. They would
</p>
<p>" leave conscience free within the bounds of the land, and permit every
</p>
<p>" man to worship God in the sincerity of his belief, whatever that be-
</p>
<p>" lief might be. Yes, it was a cause on which he did not think he was
</p>
<p>" profane in saying it, Providence well might smile. It was a cause which
</p>
<p>" could be sanctified by Heaven, for its object was to make every Irish-
</p>
<p>" man better, and no man worse than he was before Let men re-
</p>
<p>" proach him as they pleased with his exclusiveness, as they called

</p>
<p>" it, and of speaking too harshly of those that will not become Re-
</p>
<p>" pealers, but he would ask them would they do anything else for
</p>
<p>" Ireland, and if they did he would be ready to join them."
</p>
<p>The most legitimate ground upon which a rational man might
</p>
<p>blame Mr. O'Connell and the Repealers would be this  that they, as-
</p>
<p>suming and arrogating to themselves that a repeal of the Statute of
</p>
<p>Union was the only remedy for the evils of Ireland, prosecuted the
</p>
<p>object of repealing that Statute with a little too much zeal, assuming
</p>
<p>that their cure was the only cure. I will not defend that course; on
</p>
<p>the contrary, I blame them for it. I do not think they had a right to
</p>
<p>assume that ; I think they had no right to diregard the opinions of
</p>
<p>every man who does not think that the repeal of that Statute would
</p>
<p>not be the only remedy for the evils of Ireland, but many who think
</p>
<p>it would be no remedy at all. I do not think they were right in that,
</p>
<p>but because I do not think they were right in that, does it follow
</p>
<p>451
</p>
<p>that I think they were criminal ? What party is it that took up a
</p>
<p>certain opinion for any period in this country that did not advocate
</p>
<p>that opinion as if it was the only right one. Is not that the common
</p>
<p>sin of all these parties  is it not plainly so ? Is not that the sin of
</p>
<p>the Orangemen  is it not the sin of the Conservatives  is it not
</p>
<p>the sin of the Chartists  is it not the sin of the Repealers? Why
</p>
<p>it is  it is the common fault of them all. Do not imagine that I am
</p>
<p>going to defend them. I censure them ; but that is all I do. Were
</p>
<p>I on a jury, called upon on my oath, or on my honour as a man 
</p>
<p>as a just man  because a person was arrogant in assuming his
</p>
<p>opinion to be the only right one, and seeking to enforce that with a
</p>
<p>little too much zeal, is it therefore that I am to find that man guilty
</p>
<p>as a foul conspirator? Gentlemen, they are distinct things; you
</p>
<p>are not here trying the reasonableness of those men in assuming that
</p>
<p>their's was the best mode of remedying the evils of Ireland. You are
</p>
<p>trying whether they entered into a criminal and foul conspiracy to
</p>
<p>commit crime. It must be a conspiring* to commit crime, or it is no
</p>
<p>conspiracy. I will demonstrate that to be as clear as light before I
</p>
<p>sit down, on authority that cannot be disputed  not by the dictum
</p>
<p>of any Judge or Judges, but by the solemn decision of the Court of
</p>
<p>Queen's Bench. But, Gentlemen, Mr. O'Connell, sensible that it
</p>
<p>would be arrogating a little too much to suppose that Repeal, and
</p>
<p>nothing else, would remedy the evils of Ireland, makes use of reser-
</p>
<p>vations which I will repeat to you. Give him the credit of believing
</p>
<p>himself that the Repeal was the only remedy  there is no crime in
</p>
<p>that. Belief is a thing over which you have no control. No man
</p>
<p>can control bis belief. A man may say he believes if he does not,
</p>
<p>but the man who does believe cannot help believing. Do not forget
</p>
<p>that. When Mr. O'Connell was accused of refusing the sympathy
</p>
<p>of those who would not become Repealers, he said : " He would ask
</p>
<p>' them would they do any thing else, and if they did, he would join
</p>
<p>" them." Is not that fair? Is it not plainly propounding to the
</p>
<p>world that all he was looking for was the happiness, the dignity, and
</p>
<p>the rights of his country  that he thought the repeal of that Statute of

</p>
<p>the Union was the best means to obtain his patriotic object; and what
</p>
<p>else did he say? " If you do not think so, show me any other, and
</p>
<p>I am ready to join you." None other, Gentlemen, was offered.
</p>
<p>Again, at Drogheda, on the 28th August, 1842: "He wished to
</p>
<p>" preserve the connexion with England by the golden links of the
</p>
<p>" Crown, but to do away with the degrading, debasing - , and impover-
</p>
<p>" ishing measure of the Union He was rejoiced to say, that
</p>
<p>' in that country (Meath) there were no Whiteboy disturbances
</p>
<p>" He would never seek to effect a Repeal as the Belgians had done;
</p>
<p>' no, he was the apostle of a different sect  he was an apostle
</p>
<p>" of that political sect that said and proved that the greatest po-
</p>
<p>" litical advantages could be obtained by peaceful means
</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen, I may here observe, that the means by which
</p>
<p>Catholic Emancipation was carried could not fail to be present to the
</p>
<p>mind of Mr. O'Connell during the whole course of this Repeal agi-
</p>
<p>452
</p>
<p>tation. And here I may call your attention to a portion of the state-
</p>
<p>ment of the Attorney-General, of which my client, I think, has no
</p>
<p>small reason to complain  to complain in point of law and to com-
</p>
<p>plain in point of justice and fairness. The Attorney-General asserted
</p>
<p>to you that the organization of this Repeal movement was after the
</p>
<p>plan of the organization of the rebellion of '98. He broadly asserted
</p>
<p>it, and he brought into court an octavo volume, which he said, but
</p>
<p>did not prove, contained a report of the committee of the House of
</p>
<p>Commons in Ireland of that day, and he told you that that committee
</p>
<p>reported to the House of Commons that certain insurrectionary, dis-
</p>
<p>loyal, and rebellious associations had been formed, and he concluded
</p>
<p>by telling you that if he opened that book and read it to you, that the
</p>
<p>organization of that rebellion, that criminal organization of '97, was
</p>
<p>the type and pattern from which the organization of the Repeal
</p>
<p>movement had been copied. Now, I arraign that course of state-
</p>
<p>ment as illegal  illegal in the highest possible degree; for no coun-
</p>
<p>sel, no matter what his rank may be, has a right, in a criminal case,
</p>
<p>to attempt to affect the minds of the jury against the party accused by
</p>
<p>his own unsupported and unsworn testimony. What right had the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General in point of law, or in point of justice, or in point
</p>
<p>of common fair dealing, to insinuate to you, or to tell you that if he
</p>
<p>read that book it would demonstrate that the Repeal agitation was
</p>
<p>copied from the organization of 1797, which had a rebellion for its ob-
</p>
<p>ject? What right had he to do that in point of law or justice, or
</p>
<p>common fairness ? I arraign that statement of his as unfounded, as
</p>
<p>a totally unfounded statement; and if his imagination traced for him,
</p>
<p>as I am quite sure it did, some likeness between the description given
</p>
<p>of the organization of '97 and that of the present Association, it was
</p>
<p>owing to his imagination alone, and he utterly deceived himself;
</p>
<p>and [ think that he felt that he had no right to put that book in
</p>
<p>evidence. I think he must have reflected very little on what he was
</p>
<p>doing if he thought he could contribute to the ends of justice by re-
</p>
<p>ferring you to that book. If he had read it in evidence I would have
</p>
<p>had it now in my hands, instead of never having seen it in my life

</p>
<p>except when I saw it with him. I would have had an opportunity of
</p>
<p>reading it from beginning to end, and of exercising my judgment
</p>
<p>and my imagination upon what I found in it, and showing you how
</p>
<p>totally distinct was the organization of '97 and '98 from that of '43
</p>
<p>and '44. The book then would be in evidence for all purposes, and
</p>
<p>would be open to observations from both sides, and it would prove
</p>
<p>whether the Attorney-General's inferences were correct or not. But
</p>
<p>when he knew that book would not be read in evidence, what right
</p>
<p>had he to refer to it in his statement, or to attempt to draw those
</p>
<p>monstrous conclusions from it, that this peaceful, moral combination,
</p>
<p>this legal Association of 1843, was copied from that atrocious, that
</p>
<p>criminal rebellion of '98 ? Gentlemen, the Attorney-General blinded
</p>
<p>himself; his zeal blinded him, it blinded him as to the facts of the
</p>
<p>case as well as to the law. He had much nearer home, much more
</p>
<p>obvious that which was the true type of this association, and now let
</p>
<p>453
</p>
<p>me implore your attention for a moment or two. Catholic emancipa-
</p>
<p>tion, which virtually had torn and agitated Ireland by a moral con-
</p>
<p>test, but not by a physical force contest, or a criminal contest, a sin-
</p>
<p>ful or an immoral contest  after twenty-nine years of a moral contest,
</p>
<p>Catholic emancipation was at last carried, and how ? Give me your at-
</p>
<p>tention for a few moments while I detail it to you. A private gentleman,
</p>
<p>SirValentineBlakeof Menlo' Castle, a very ingenious man, fond of read-
</p>
<p>ing political Acts of Parliament affecting the rights of the Catholics
</p>
<p>of Ireland, came to the conclusion that there was no power to prevent
</p>
<p>any constituency returning a Roman Catholic member as their repre-
</p>
<p>sentative. He propounded that plan, and 1 have not the least doubt that
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General and other lawyers who hear me would say,
</p>
<p>that tliere was as little law to sustain that doctrine as the one that the
</p>
<p>Queen could issue writs and summon a Parliament in Ireland; one
</p>
<p>was just as untenable in point of law as the other, and you will ob-
</p>
<p>serve as I go on how striking is the likeness between the father and
</p>
<p>the son. Acting upon that suggestion, which I believe Sir Valentine
</p>
<p>Blake himself communicated to Mr. O'Connell, the seat for Clare
</p>
<p>having been then vacant in 1829, Mr. O'Connell says to the people,
</p>
<p>" an Act of Parliament is not necessary to emancipate us; we will
</p>
<p>do it ourselves." He says the same in 1843. We will do it our-
</p>
<p>selves with the help of our little Queen. " Give me," he says to the
</p>
<p>electors of Clare, " your good assistance, never mind your landloids.
</p>
<p>I am qualified to be a Member of Parliament," And yet, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>that was not considered a crime ; he was not prosecuted for that.
</p>
<p>He went down to Clare ; the whole county got into a ferment, a fer-
</p>
<p>ment which had its foundation in law, peace, good order, and sobriety,
</p>
<p>which never had been before equalled in this country. The whole
</p>
<p>population of the county came together as one man ; they flocked in
</p>
<p>troops from all directions ; their enthusiasm knew no bounds, and
</p>
<p>the landlords might as well have talked to the winds as to them.
</p>
<p>No temporal consideration that could be suggested could prevent them
</p>
<p>from voting for Mr. O'Connell. Persons who had come over from
</p>
<p>England to witness the contest reported its results to Peel and Wel-

</p>
<p>lington, and the Emancipation Bill was passed the very next session,
</p>
<p>although it was decided by the proper tribunal that Mr. O'Connell's
</p>
<p>election was illegal, and he was not permitted to take his seat. It
</p>
<p>very naturally occurred to Mr. O'Connell's acute mind, that it would
</p>
<p>be a sure and politic measure in his Repeal movement to have re-
</p>
<p>course, in order to the attainment of his object, to a similar course of
</p>
<p>proceeding to that which he had adopted in the struggle for Emanci-
</p>
<p>pation ; and it is to this fact that everything is to be attributed that fell
</p>
<p>from him in reference to the revival of the old Irish Parliament.
</p>
<p>Hence it was that he used such language: "This, your Parliament,
</p>
<p>" is not dead, but only slumbers. We want no Act of the Imperial
</p>
<p>" Legislature to procure its revival. Let the Queen only issue her
</p>
<p>" writs, the Chancellor, you may take my word for it, will sign them,
</p>
<p>" and then see how soon we will have a Parliament in College-green."
</p>
<p>He wanted the people of Ireland to make a magnificent demonstration
</p>
<p>454
</p>
<p>of moral power similar to that which was made on occasion of the
</p>
<p>Clare election, when the people were bound together with such una-
</p>
<p>nimity of peaceful purpose, that they would endure the pain and
</p>
<p>ignominy of a blow rather than violate the peace by retaliating on
</p>
<p>their adversary. One man, and he was the most quarrelsome man in
</p>
<p>Clare, did actually bear the blow, and told the man who struck, him that
</p>
<p>he would give him the value of his pig afier the election was over, if he
</p>
<p>would repeat the blow. Mr. O'Connell wanted to have the people's
</p>
<p>mind brought to the same tone and temper in the year 1843 in which
</p>
<p>it was in 1829, and that circumstance fully accounted for every thing-
</p>
<p>he had said in reference to the resuscitation of the Irish Parliament.
</p>
<p>He told them that he was tired of speaking, and that he wanted prac-
</p>
<p>tical measures ; but he did not allude to deeds of arms. He told them
</p>
<p>expressly what he wanted. He told them that he wanted a council of
</p>
<p>three hundred to sit in Dublin, in order that the people's determination
</p>
<p>might be fully evinced, and when the popular mind had given itself
</p>
<p>the fullest expression, then the Queen was to be besought to issue her
</p>
<p>writs, and the Legislature was to be requested to sanction the desire
</p>
<p>of the people to have a Parliament of their own. He wished to in-
</p>
<p>stitute in this country the same great moral combination which had
</p>
<p>been so successful in the year '29 ; he wished to appeal for success to
</p>
<p>the same agencies by which Mr. Peel, who gained his popularity in
</p>
<p>England by abusing the Catholics and resisting their emancipation,
</p>
<p>was induced to come into the House of Commons with the Emanci-
</p>
<p>pation Bill in his hands, and to use all his influence with the Crown
</p>
<p>to get it passed. That, Gentlemen, is the very origin and the rational
</p>
<p>explanation of Mr. O'Connell's plan for the restoration of the Irish
</p>
<p>Parliament ; and I defy any man, with a fair and honourable mind, to
</p>
<p>whom this explanation of Mr. O'Connell's conduct is once suggested,
</p>
<p>not to be at once completely satisfied with it. I admit and believe
</p>
<p>that there may be many honest men, who, differing from Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell on political matters, may have heretofore conscientiously believed
</p>
<p>that his objects were different from what they are in point of fact ;
</p>
<p>but when once the mind of such a man has been brought to consider

</p>
<p>such an explanation as I have now given, which manifestly bears on
</p>
<p>the face of it all the characteristics of truth, I defy him not to ac-
</p>
<p>knowledge that the explanation is satisfactory. The counsel for the
</p>
<p>prosecution would have you believe that Mr. O'Connell, when he
</p>
<p>came to the time of the monster meetings, had his scheme ripening
</p>
<p>for a violent and treasonable insurrection in Ireland, for that he had
</p>
<p>in contemplation the training of people to military operations, not by
</p>
<p>nightly drillings, but inuring them to long marches, for that his meet-
</p>
<p>ings were held at a great distance from the respective houses of the
</p>
<p>people who attended them. By this means it was pretended that the
</p>
<p>people were habituated to march like the soldiery through the coun-
</p>
<p>try. That is the interpretation put upon Mr. O'Connell's proceed-
</p>
<p>ings by the Attorney-General ; but if Mr. O'Connell had it in con-
</p>
<p>templation to appeal to measures of physical force, and to organize
</p>
<p>the masses for that purpose, is it likely that he would have repudiated
</p>
<p>455
</p>
<p>and denounced the Chartists and Whiteboys. The cooperation of the
</p>
<p>Chartists would have been invaluable for the carrying out of such an
</p>
<p>illegal project. He might at all events have desisted from abusing them.
</p>
<p>He did not do so. If he had contemplated violence, would such words as
</p>
<p>those have escaped his lips at a meeting of the Association, on the 1st
</p>
<p>January, 1843: " He had received the most certain information that the
</p>
<p>" societies which were established in England under the nameofChart-
</p>
<p>" ists, or rather the branch of them named Socialists, were making the
</p>
<p>" greatest exertions to spread their fatal principles through Ireland.
</p>
<p>" He was not going to accuse the Chartists generally, or anything
</p>
<p>" like universally, of being Socialists, but a great number of the
</p>
<p>" Chartists were Socialists in England and Scotland, and all the
</p>
<p>" Socialists were Chartists He was shocked to hear there were
</p>
<p>" Socialists in Dublin, and every man must hear it with sorrow ; it
</p>
<p>" was the first time that such a misfortune had happened in Ireland.
</p>
<p>" Hitherto they differed from one another in religious belief; there
</p>
<p>" were Protestant, Catholic, Presbyterian, Dissenter, and Metho-
</p>
<p>" dist, but they were all Christians Wherever the Repealers
</p>
<p>" were strong, they put down Chartism and Socialism It was
</p>
<p>" not in Dublin he was afraid of them, for there they could take
</p>
<p>" measures to counteract their machinations; but they were going
</p>
<p>" through the country and calling the people together, and using his
</p>
<p>" name to induce them to join them. They said to the people
</p>
<p>" O'Connell wanted them to be ready, and they came down from him
</p>
<p>" amongst them; but they lied, the villains, and from that spot
</p>
<p>" he denounced them Should such miscreants as those, he
</p>
<p>" asked, be tolerated, and was he not entitled to have the assistance
</p>
<p>** of clergymen of every persuasion to put them down? . . . .He wa3
</p>
<p>" convinced that those miscreants would practise upon the ignorance
</p>
<p>" of the people, and lead them into secret societies for the purpose
</p>
<p>" of betraying them He proclaimed to them from that spot,
</p>
<p>" that if they had anything to do with the Chartists or Socialists,
</p>
<p>" they would put themselves in their power, and be made the victims
</p>
<p>" of their plans. He trusted that the sentiments he uttered on the

<p>" subject would be circulated through the country, and that the honest
</p>
<p>" shrewdness of the Irish people would induce them to take hold of
</p>
<p>" those incendiaries, and bring their acts to light." There is the
</p>
<p>language of a man who, if you are to believe the Attorney-General,
</p>
<p>was at that moment organizing his countrymen to make him the leader
</p>
<p>of an atrocious republic ; of a man who, it is insinuated, had in con-
</p>
<p>templation the wicked and nefarious design of arming the father
</p>
<p>against the son, and the son against the father, if the father was loyal,
</p>
<p>and the son a rebel ; of putting the rope in the hand of the execu-
</p>
<p>tioner  the bayonet in the hand of the soldier  the pike into the
</p>
<p>hand of the peasant ; of deluging his native land in blood, and
</p>
<p>creating scenes of anarchy and horror too dreadful for the hu-
</p>
<p>man mind to dwell upon. Gentlemen, is that imputation to re-
</p>
<p>ceive credit at your hands ? As honest men, and as men of
</p>
<p>common sense, I ask your integrity, and I ask your intelli-
</p>
<p>gence, can you bring yourselves to believe it ?
</p>
<p>45G
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the definition given you by the Attorney- General of the
</p>
<p>crime of conspiracy, describes no crime at all ; for yon must recol-
</p>
<p>lect, that a combination or agreement does not imply guilt ; to do some
</p>
<p>illegal act implies no guilt ; or to effect an illegal purpose by illegal
</p>
<p>means implies no guilt. I will prove this to you on undoubted autho-
</p>
<p>rity. I am not going to misrepresent one Judge or mislead another, but
</p>
<p>I am going to cite what no Judge can deny is a binding legal authori-
</p>
<p>ty, a long established and plainly decided case. It is the case of
</p>
<p>Ilex v. Turner, 13 East, 228. That was an indictment for a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, which stated that the defendants unlawfully and wickedly
</p>
<p>devising to imagine, &c, did conspire, confederate, and agree toge-
</p>
<p>ther to go into a certain preserve for hares belonging to T. G., and
</p>
<p>against the will of the said T. G., to snare and kill said hares, and
</p>
<p>to procure divers bludgeons, and other offensive weapons, and to go
</p>
<p>to the said preserve armed therewith, for the purpose of opposing
</p>
<p>any person who should endeavour to apprehend, or obstruct, or pre-
</p>
<p>vent them from carrying into execution their unlawful purpose, and
</p>
<p>that they did, in pursuance of such conspiracy, go into the grounds
</p>
<p>and set snares to catch hares. After a verdict of guilty, amotion
</p>
<p>was made in arrest of judgment for the insufficiency of the charge,
</p>
<p>on the ground that it was only that of an agreement to commit a mere
</p>
<p>trespass upon the property and to set snares for hares, and was not an
</p>
<p>indictable offence, but at most only an injury of a private nature. The
</p>
<p>judgment was arrested by Lord Ellenborough, who was as good a
</p>
<p>Judge on all legal subjects as ever sat on the English Bench, and as
</p>
<p>high a Prerogative Judge as ever adorned it from the days of the
</p>
<p>Conquest down to the present hour. Those parties agreed to commit
</p>
<p>that offence, not to rob a man of his property, in a certain peculiar
</p>
<p>sense, because that would be a felony, and to snare hares is not
</p>
<p>a felony. But I ask you  was the project of those eight persons ho-
</p>
<p>nest? was it innocent? As to the enjoyment of property, with re-
</p>
<p>gard to the spilling of human blood which might have taken place in
</p>
<p>consequence of the bludgeons the parties were armed with, was it
</p>
<p>innocent? Every man would say, that in all" those particulars the

</p>
<p>project was not innocent, and the jury found the defendants guilty of
</p>
<p>a conspiracy. In that case, on the motion in arrest of judgment,
</p>
<p>Lord Ellenborough, in giving the unanimous decision of the Court,
</p>
<p>said, alluding to a case cited: "That was a conspiracy to indict
</p>
<p>" another of a capital crime, which, no doubt, is an offence, and the
</p>
<p>" case of Rex v. Eccles and others was considered as a conspiracy to
</p>
<p>" do an unlawful act affecting the public. But I should be sorry that
</p>
<p>" the cases of conspiracy against individuals, which had gone far
</p>
<p>" enough, should be pushed still further. I should be sorry to have
</p>
<p>" it doubted whether persons agreeing to go and sport upon another's
</p>
<p>" ground  in other words, to commit a civil trespass  should be
</p>
<p>" thereby in peril of an indictment for an offence which would sub-
</p>
<p>ject them to infamous punishment." It may be said that the pre-
</p>
<p>sent case is analogous to the case referred to by Lord Ellenborough 
</p>
<p>457
</p>
<p>that is, the case of JRex v.Eccles  as affecting the public, that like as
</p>
<p>in that case the parties had combined to restrict trade, and as they
</p>
<p>did so, they were guilty of conspiracy. But I say, to be guilty of a
</p>
<p>conspiracy, the parties must be proved to have acted together with a
</p>
<p>criminal mind. The true distinction is, that to be a conspiracy there
</p>
<p>must be a criminal act performed; because if tbe means be criminal,
</p>
<p>to put the means in execution is a crime, and therefore knowing and
</p>
<p>believing it to be a crime is essential to constitute a conspiracy. Al-
</p>
<p>though I deprecate the notion of defining crime, so as to bind a jury
</p>
<p>by the definition and to take from them the decision on the question
</p>
<p>of guilt or innocence, and to conclude them, as it were, by the defi-
</p>
<p>nition, so as to make it matter of law ; yet crime may be defined and
</p>
<p>ought to be defined for technical and legal purposes, in order to know
</p>
<p>how to frame the indictment ; and also for the purpose of knowing
</p>
<p>what judgment to give when a party is found guilty by the jury. For
</p>
<p>these purposes a definition is proper and necessary; but for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of binding or concluding a jury, the law recognizes no such de-
</p>
<p>finition, because the guilty purpose and the intention of the party
</p>
<p>accused is a question in all cases exclusively for the jury, and forms a
</p>
<p>necessary ingredient, and that is never to be inferred by the Court as
</p>
<p>a matter of law, as a necessary consequence of any acts; is never to
</p>
<p>be established as a matter of law, nor to be assumed until found by a
</p>
<p>jury. But if I were to form a definition which could, in point of
</p>
<p>law, be upheld as an adequate definition of conspiracy, I would call
</p>
<p>it a wicked confederacy of two or more persons knowingly and wil-
</p>
<p>fully to aid and abet each other in the commission of a crime. I
</p>
<p>would call persons so combining conspirators. This appears to me
</p>
<p>consistent with reason, law, and common sense ; but to substitute
</p>
<p>mere concurrence and coincidence of purpose for concerted and wilful
</p>
<p>combination; to substitute the word illegal for the word criminal,
</p>
<p>and to say that men have criminally conspired if they have agreed
</p>
<p>to do some act which turns out to be an unlawful act, if this be a
</p>
<p>criminal conspiracy, what man would be safe? If the question of
</p>
<p>guilt or innocence is to be concluded by the mere legality of the pur-

</p>
<p>pose in the complicated state of (he law, who can be sure that he
</p>
<p>will not fall into the condition of a criminal conspirator, even when
</p>
<p>acting with the purest and best motives, if the object in view should
</p>
<p>turn out not to be legal ? If so monstrous a proposition is to be adopt-
</p>
<p>ed as that every member of an association is to affect every other by
</p>
<p>his acts, in every case where the objects of the association shall turn
</p>
<p>out to be merely illegal, and if crime is to be spelled out in every
</p>
<p>case where legality cannot be shown, no member of any associa-
</p>
<p>tion, at least of any political association, can be safe.
</p>
<p>There are, Gentlemen, one or two other topics upon which I have io
</p>
<p>address you. Another charge in the indictment is, that Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>and others conspired together to create disaffection in the army. The
</p>
<p>only evidence of that portion of the conspiracy is a letter written by a
</p>
<p>Mr. Power. Gentlemen, that Mr. Power has been served with a Crown
</p>
<p>summons to attend here as a witness. If that letter  if the contents
</p>
<p>3N
</p>
<p>458
</p>
<p>of it amount to an effort to destroy the affections of the soldiery to the
</p>
<p>Government  that letter had for its object a foul crime. To tell the
</p>
<p>soldiery, whose duty it is without reflection to obey the orders of the
</p>
<p>intelligent minds of the persons under whose commands they are,
</p>
<p>and whom they are unthinkingly bound to obey  1 say, if that
</p>
<p>letter was written for such a purpose, it is a criminal one ; and the man
</p>
<p>who wrote it ought to have been prosecuted. I say so, assuming that
</p>
<p>to have been his intention ; but, recollect, I am not saying that it was.
</p>
<p>But whether it is so or not, if we had the author here to answer be-
</p>
<p>fore this high Court for writing what would be a triable case, one not
</p>
<p>requiring three or four weeks' debating, for the jury could have come
</p>
<p>to a conclusion with a reasonable certainty upon which they might
</p>
<p>found a conviction or an acquittal. If, therefore, the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General thought that this letter was written for a criminal purpose 
</p>
<p>for it must be a criminal purpose  he should have prosecuted the
</p>
<p>writer, and I am sorry he did not prosecute him ; again, if he did not
</p>
<p>think so, I am equally sorry it should have been brought forward here
</p>
<p>for the purpose of damaging those who had nothing to do with it. But
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell is proved to have praised the sergeants of the army 
</p>
<p>to have said they were the finest body of men in the world  arid to
</p>
<p>have said that they ought to be officers, and that if he succeeded they
</p>
<p>should. Thus, it is said, he thought to seduce the soldiery from their
</p>
<p>duty. Now, Gentlemen, where you have two motives that may be
</p>
<p>ascribed to the accused, the one an innocent and a legal one, the other
</p>
<p>wicked, criminal, and illegal, I think rational men are bound to acquit
</p>
<p>of the guilty motive. If they can reasonably adopt the innocent one 
</p>
<p>if they have no difficulty in adopting the innocent construction, they
</p>
<p>should repel the criminal charge. Let them remember that Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell was endeavouring to effect conciliation among all classes,
</p>
<p>peasantry and soldiery alike, and that one of the greatest means of
</p>
<p>inducing those connected with the Repeal Association of every grade
</p>
<p>to entertain those feelings which Mr. O'Connell wished to propagate,
</p>
<p>was the strong expression on the part of Mr. O'Connell, that he en-
</p>
<p>tertained those feelings himself, and his object being to put an end to

</p>
<p>the smallest inclination on the part of the peasantry towards insulting
</p>
<p>or in any sort of way disliking the soldiery ; and the showing that
</p>
<p>those peasantry could see an army among them without either feel-
</p>
<p>ing dislike to that army, or apprehension from it, was one of the pur-
</p>
<p>poses of Mr. O'Connell in those demonstrations, as also to impress his
</p>
<p>hearers with a feeling of respect for the sergeants of the army. This
</p>
<p>language was not addressed to the army. No soldier  no sergeant was
</p>
<p>proved to be present; and do you think that Mr. O'Connell was fool
</p>
<p>enough to suppose, that certain expressions of his, used for a different
</p>
<p>purpose, should, when conveyed through the newspapers to the sergeants
</p>
<p>of the British army, have the effect of winning those sergeants from
</p>
<p>their allegiance and their duty? It is perfectly ridiculous to think so.
</p>
<p>But, Gentlemen, Mr. O'Connell did not keep in his breast his senti-
</p>
<p>ments in relation to any sort of tampering with the army. At the Re-
</p>
<p>peal Association on the 14th September, 1843, when his plot was ripe,
</p>
<p>459
</p>
<p>when everything he had said in praise of the sergeants was long since
</p>
<p>published, when everything had been done that could possibly be sup-
</p>
<p>posed as intending to seduce them, at that meeting he forbids any
</p>
<p>person connected with that body, to interfere in any manner with the
</p>
<p>soldiery. Now, I pray your attention to the period at which Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell thus plainly and publicly repudiates, disavows, and prohi-
</p>
<p>bits any intercourse of any kind with any member of the army. That
</p>
<p>was in September, 1843; and we now, in January, 1844, are trying
</p>
<p>this case. Out of the whole British army which has been in Ireland,
</p>
<p>openly in the pay of the Government, who have instituted this prose-
</p>
<p>cution, have you had produced to you a single sergeant, corporal, or
</p>
<p>private soldier, or any single individual, to whom he has opened his lips
</p>
<p>upon this particular subject? Was it, therefore, to be pretended, that
</p>
<p>this prohibition was not a genuine one  that he meant " don't nail
</p>
<p>his ears to the pump ;" or was it delivered in the true spirit of truth,
</p>
<p>intending that he should be obeyed ? And was he not obeyed ? Am
</p>
<p>I not entitled to assume that he was obeyed ? Can the counsel for the
</p>
<p>Crown produce any one single soldier or sergeant to show he bad been
</p>
<p>tampered with ? Was it to be expected that the traversers should
</p>
<p>prove it ? That would be impossible. We could not prove a negative !
</p>
<p>Why did not the Crown prove any single act done by any single being
</p>
<p>connected with the Association, for the purpose of seducing the sol-
</p>
<p>diery ? It was open to them to do so. Every act of every member
</p>
<p>of the Association would be evidence against the traversers. Why did
</p>
<p>they not produce and prove a tampering of any kind with them ? Why
</p>
<p>will you not attribute to Mr. O'Connell a wish of begetting in the
</p>
<p>minds of the people a feeling of love and respect for soldiers? The
</p>
<p>people were protected by th^ soldiers, and that they should love them
</p>
<p>is a thing 1 think is to be desired and wished for by the community.
</p>
<p>He wished to remove from their minds any feelings of hostility to
</p>
<p>them, and to convince them that they were men deserving of respect.
</p>
<p>Why should he not be so interpreted ? The whole course of his life 
</p>
<p>the whole torrent of his eloquence  everything he has ever said or
</p>
<p>done, has had for its object the establishment of love, order, and good

</p>
<p>will amongst his fellow-men. He has, no doubt, often expressed a strong-
</p>
<p>political bias, and a strong dislike of political sentiments disagreeing
</p>
<p>with his own. I am not here to defend him for what he has done
</p>
<p>wrong in that respect. I do not want you to attend to my argument
</p>
<p>if I am so uncandid  so unprincipled as to support that which I do not
</p>
<p>believe to be right. At the same time, full allowance should be made
</p>
<p>for his feelings on the occasion, when he did so forget himself; when he
</p>
<p>so forgot that benignant nature which, beyond doubt, belongs to him.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, another imputation in this case, is the collection of mo-
</p>
<p>ney ; and I hope before I sit down, I shall convince my friend, Sergeant
</p>
<p>Warren, that that money has been collected, not as chesnuts are drawn
</p>
<p>from the fire, but fairly and legitimately collected. In the present
</p>
<p>very peculiar state of society, although justice should be common to
</p>
<p>all, free as air, and fresh as the water we drink, yet it is impossible to
</p>
<p>get it if you have not money. Every Court of Justice is open, as
</p>
<p>4G0
</p>
<p>Home Tooke said, and so was the London Tavern ; but one should have
</p>
<p>money to pay their way, because to ascertain whether a man had jus-
</p>
<p>tice on his side or not, requires the aid and assistance of scientific
</p>
<p>minds, and the aid and assistance of those cannot be procured
</p>
<p>without paying for them. So that it is perfectly impossible for any
</p>
<p>one individual to bring- his case within the proper jurisdiction to re-
</p>
<p>press his grievances, without having a golden key ; it would be im-
</p>
<p>possible to collect signatures to the petitions of millions, without con-
</p>
<p>siderable expense. It took 100,000 to canvass the county of York,
</p>
<p>and yet it does not contain a tithe of the inhabitants of this country.
</p>
<p>Now, there is just one other subject that has not been touched upon
</p>
<p>yet, and that is, the Arbitration Courts.
</p>
<p>It is said in this indictment that those arbitration courts
</p>
<p>were devised by conspiracy  criminal conspiracy  for a criminal
</p>
<p>purpose, that criminal purpose being to bring into odium and con-
</p>
<p>tempt the constituted courts and tribunals of this country. Now,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, in the first place, if you can believe that any of the
</p>
<p>traversers in his own breast entertained so illegal, so immoral,
</p>
<p>so criminal, so foul, so uncharitable a purpose as that, come down
</p>
<p>upon him with the heaviest censure that your minds can bestow,
</p>
<p>and you have my concurrence. But unless you believe that they
</p>
<p>so entertained that diabolical purpose of bringing into contempt,
</p>
<p>odium, and disrespect, those without respecting whom  without ve-
</p>
<p>nerating whom it would be impossible for any society to thrive; un-
</p>
<p>less you believe that that wicked, illegal, and immoral purpose was
</p>
<p>made the subject of a criminal conspiracy between two or more of the
</p>
<p>traversers; unless you believe that two or more of the traversers did
</p>
<p>criminally combine to carry that unhallowed purpose into effect, I
</p>
<p>care not by what means ; no matter whether any one of them  no
</p>
<p>matter whether every one of them in his own mind entertained such
</p>
<p>a purpose, you cannot, unless you believe that they conspired to effect
</p>
<p>it, find them guilty. Now, in the first place, have you any evidence
</p>
<p>that any one of them ever entertained such a purpose? Where is
</p>
<p>the expression of any one of them of any such purpose  of any such

</p>
<p>feeling in relation to the constituted tribunals of the country ? At
</p>
<p>some of those meetings some one or other, 1 really forget who, spoke
</p>
<p>about not wanting* the Saxon ermine, and so on. Gentlemen, that
</p>
<p>was improper language. Why ? Because it was open to be misinter-
</p>
<p>preted. I do not think the man who uttered it, whoever he was, meant
</p>
<p>to say that the Judges of this country were Saxons in ermine, that
</p>
<p>ought not to be respected and revered as Judges. It was hyperbole 
</p>
<p>censurable hyperbole  but it was not the crime of conspiracy. It was
</p>
<p>not any of the traversers uttered it, none of them approved of it. They
</p>
<p>did not express the wicked purpose of bringing the Courts of the
</p>
<p>country into disrepute. What did they do ? They instituted those
</p>
<p>Arbitration Courts. Now, just for a moment, attend to me while I
</p>
<p>bring fairly before you the whole of the matter. The Chancellor,
</p>
<p>believing it to be proper and right  believing it to be his duty to the
</p>
<p>country  I have no doubt he did think that magistrates who attended
</p>
<p>461
</p>
<p>those Repeal meetings were unfit to be justices of the peace in Ire-
</p>
<p>land  withdrew the commission from every one that attended those
</p>
<p>meetings. Others of them took umbrage at this, and ihey resigned.
</p>
<p>That led to a good deal of angry discussion, and a good deal of unjus-
</p>
<p>tifiable language was no doubt used in reference to it. The act of
</p>
<p>the Chancellor was dealt with in many publications in terms not ex-
</p>
<p>pressing that respect he is entitled to  entitled to by reason of the
</p>
<p>place he holds  entitled to from the manner in which he fills it  and
</p>
<p>entitled to by the power which he wields in a way in which it was
</p>
<p>scarcely ever wielded before, by legal acquirements which perhaps never
</p>
<p>belonged to a lawyer in this country but himself. Do not ima-
</p>
<p>gine that I stand here to palliate or justify in any way the lan-
</p>
<p>guage of any newspaper, of any man, or any party, or any asso-
</p>
<p>ciation, upon any act, judicial or ministerial, performed by such
</p>
<p>a functionary. But the act was calculated to beget anger, and it did
</p>
<p>beget anger ; but it produced no other effect except to beget anger.
</p>
<p>That, however, did not establish a conspiracy, nor did it exhibit a
</p>
<p>fixed and diabolical determination to bring into contempt the judicial
</p>
<p>tribunals of the country. When the magistrates were dismissed by
</p>
<p>the Chancellor, the people said in their turn that they would be up
</p>
<p>with him by-arid- by ; if he dismissed the magistrates in whom the
</p>
<p>people had confidence, why they would make Arbitrators for themselves,
</p>
<p>and they accordingly made arbitrators of those dismissed magistrates, for
</p>
<p>the purpose of deciding their differences with their own consent; but
</p>
<p>not of entertaining any cases except where both parties agreed to
</p>
<p>refer the matter in dispute to their adjudication. I tell you. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, that is a legal purpose. Mind, there was not a meeting of these
</p>
<p>.Arbitrators held throughout the country that was not publicly adver-
</p>
<p>tised ; every man in the community knew that it was to take place,
</p>
<p>and every policeman in the district was at liberty to attend at them,
</p>
<p>and observe what was done; and yet the Crown closed their case, sa-
</p>
<p>tisfied with the production of a single policeman, who swore that he
</p>
<p>found Mr. John O'Connell and Dr. Gray sitting at the Rock, waiting
</p>
<p>for suitors, and that he was treated with every respect and attention,

</p>
<p>and not interfered with  that he saw one case decided by the Arbi-
</p>
<p>trators, and that he supposed it was decided well. Now, if that was
</p>
<p>illegal, the Ousel Galley would be illegal, and it is not. They have
</p>
<p>their forms, and they will give them to you if you want them; and if
</p>
<p>a man comes before them he must be bound by their rules, and they
</p>
<p>will not allow him to depart from them, and they will make him pay
</p>
<p>them their fees, which are, in the first place, applied to the expenses of
</p>
<p>carrying on the tribunal, and the residue is applied to charitable pur-
</p>
<p>poses, and there is nothing wrong in all that. The adoption of these
</p>
<p>Courts only shows the peaceful determination of the Irish people to
</p>
<p>forget all past differences, and settle any disputes that may arise be-
</p>
<p>tween them through the intervention of these Arbitrators ; and there
</p>
<p>is nothing illegal or wrong in that. Gentlemen, I should not think it
</p>
<p>necessary to occupy your time at any greater length on the subject,
</p>
<p>but that it is suggested to me to remind you of the Quakers, who settle
</p>
<p>462
</p>
<p>all their differences by arbitration. They don't go to law with each
</p>
<p>other. If they did, except in those cases reserved by the^Society,
</p>
<p>they would be expelled  they would be read out of meeting, and
</p>
<p>there is nothing illegal in all this ; God forbid there should !
</p>
<p>THURSDAY, February 1st.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn.  I am instructed, my Lords, to submit, on the part of
</p>
<p>the traversers, that the Court should adjourn until the 15th of April.
</p>
<p>We conceive that the Court has no power, under the Act of Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment, to proceed with the trial after the term is ended. If your
</p>
<p>Lordships should be of a different opinion, we request that you will
</p>
<p>take a note of the objection.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  Certainly.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside.
</p>
<p>May it please your Lordships.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, in this case I appear before you as
</p>
<p>counsel for Charles Gavan Duffy, the proprietor of the newspaper
</p>
<p>called the Nation. I could have wished my client had selected his
</p>
<p>advocate from among my brethren at the bar, of whom so many may
</p>
<p>be found my superiors in every talent and in every acquirement.
</p>
<p>The sense of inferiority is increased by the disparity between my
</p>
<p>humble abilities and the task committed to my charge ; nevertheless,
</p>
<p>assured of your patience, convinced of your indulgence, satisfied of
</p>
<p>your anxiety to hear candidly what may be urged on the part of the
</p>
<p>accused, from whatever quarter it may come, I gain resolution from
</p>
<p>confidence in you. The solemnity of this state prosecution would be
</p>
<p>enough to bespeak your considerate attention. The principles in-
</p>
<p>volved in the issue  the all-pervading anxiety of the public  the very
</p>
<p>nature of the accusation itself combine to mark out this as a question
</p>
<p>of no ordinary expectation. My anxiety is so to place before you the
</p>
<p>merits of my client's case, that justice may prevail and the cause of
</p>
<p>public freedom may triumph. I shall not at the outset disguise from you
</p>
<p>that the result of this case is regarded by me with trembling appre-
</p>
<p>hension, not from the vulgar fear of lawless outbreak or of popular
</p>
<p>fury ; the arm of power is strong enough to repress and punish such

</p>
<p>excesses ; my apprehension arises from another and a better motive.
</p>
<p>I feel the importance of your decision, I am anxious for the character
</p>
<p>of our common country, for the purity of justice, that your decision
</p>
<p>may be consistent with the principles of a free Constitution, and may
</p>
<p>rest on the immoveable ground of truth. Be assured this day's pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings will be scanned by the opinion of enlightened England, and
</p>
<p>of whatever other country possesses freedom. As far as you can, as
</p>
<p>far as human infirmity will permit, discharge your duty unflinch-
</p>
<p>ingly between the Crown and your fellow-subject. Be tender of that
</p>
<p>subject's freedom, and your decision will be applauded by your own
</p>
<p>463
</p>
<p>consciences and by all just men throughout the world. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>you are not impannelled to try the traversers for their political opinions.
</p>
<p>The soundness or unsoundness, the policy or impolicy of their proceed-
</p>
<p>ings, the wisdom or the folly of their actions, the possibility or impos-
</p>
<p>sibility of their projects being carried into execution, form no part
</p>
<p>whatever of your inquiry : still less do you sit in judgment on the style
</p>
<p>exhibited by political writers, or on the taste shown by a popular
</p>
<p>speaker; your's is a severer duty than that of the moralist or critic.
</p>
<p>Although you should be satisfied that some of the speeches made were
</p>
<p>intemperate or rash ; although you may condemn the character or
</p>
<p>style of many of the written productions which were given in evidence
</p>
<p>before you ; although you may disapprove of the general objects in
</p>
<p>view by the parties accused this day, still there would not be the least
</p>
<p>conceivable approach made thereby to the decision of the question of
</p>
<p>their guilt or innocence of the particular subject matter charged by
</p>
<p>the present indictment. Crime is what is alleged against the traver-
</p>
<p>sers, crime of a peculiar and a defined character. If that peculiar
</p>
<p>crime, as it is described and explained on the face of the in-
</p>
<p>dictment, be not clearly and distinctly proved, no matter of what
</p>
<p>other supposed offence the traversers by possibility may be sug-
</p>
<p>gested to be guilty, still you would be bound to acquit them on
</p>
<p>the present indictment. To find a man guilty of one charge be-
</p>
<p>cause there may be a surmise that he might be accused of another,
</p>
<p>would be to violate the law and trample on justice. From the strict
</p>
<p>line of your duty you will not swerve. Gentlemen, you are not  I
</p>
<p>say it with deference  to remember any one word spoken or written
</p>
<p>by the traversers, or any of them, which has not been proved in evi-
</p>
<p>dence against them on the present occasion. The crime of which
</p>
<p>they are accused is that of conspiracy. In the proper acceptation of
</p>
<p>the word, there is nothing criminal involved in it ; it means having one
</p>
<p>spirit ; and the prevailing idea conveyed by it is, that of a common
</p>
<p>sentiment amongst men for the accomplishment of a common object.
</p>
<p>Community of sentiment on political subjects is not criminal. Asso-
</p>
<p>ciations exist for all purposes. There are literary, scientific, religious,

</p>
<p>and political societies. Their object is to accomplish a given end ; to
</p>
<p>concentrate opinion, and to strengthen that opinion ; to bring it to
</p>
<p>bear on particular subjects to which they are devotedly attached ; and
</p>
<p>by means of that concentration to obtain benefits and blessings which
</p>
<p>otherwise might not be accomplished. Governments are naturally
</p>
<p>quiescent. They are repugnant to change, and adverse to popular
</p>
<p>movements ; and, therefore, it requires the greatest efforts  and per-
</p>
<p>haps it is wise it should  and the greatest concentration of opinion, to
</p>
<p>obtain from the Government that which, when it is obtained, all par-
</p>
<p>ties agree is a benefit and an improvement. It is by such means
</p>
<p>that the wisest reforms have been effected. The greatest triumphs of
</p>
<p>humanity have been so accomplished ; the noblest projects that ever
</p>
<p>entered into the human head have so been gained. In ordinary cases,
</p>
<p>when men are charged with a particular crime, it is to be proved
</p>
<p>whether they are guilty or innocent by what they themselves have
</p>
<p>done or written ; and the evidence to convict them must be given
</p>
<p>4G4
</p>
<p>under the stiict and rigid rules prescribed and fixed by law. But, as
</p>
<p>you have seen, in this crime of conspiracy, a latitude of proof is per-
</p>
<p>mitted, which your own experience, as jurors, tells you would be suf-
</p>
<p>fered in no other form of proceeding-. One man is sought to be af-
</p>
<p>fected, not with what he himself has done, or spoken, or committed,
</p>
<p>but with what other men have done, spoken, or committed. That he
</p>
<p>should suffer for the consequence of his own acts or his own speeches
</p>
<p>is natural and right, because he can control the one and regulate the
</p>
<p>other ; but it seems, at first sight, difficult to understand the justice of
</p>
<p>the rule, that guilt shall be fixed on a man, not for what he himself
</p>
<p>has done against the law, but for what has been done by other persons
</p>
<p>at a distance, over whose n ovements he has no control, whose tongue
</p>
<p>he does not license, and cannot check, and over whose actions he has
</p>
<p>no authority or power. If, Gentlemen, in an ordinary case, that ob-
</p>
<p>servation is founded on good sense, it has infinitely more weight when
</p>
<p>you come to apply it to a charge of political conspiracy. There it is
</p>
<p>necessary for a jury to be much more on their guard ; for the incau-
</p>
<p>tious language, the improper actions of one man, may be sought by a
</p>
<p>good administration, or by a bad one, to be visited on another man,
</p>
<p>who may be obnoxious to either. It is our blessing that we are sup-
</p>
<p>posed to live under defined laws, pointing out exactly what we are to
</p>
<p>do and what we are to avoid, showing us our responsibilities, and how
</p>
<p>we may escape them, and how we may comply with the requirements
</p>
<p>of the law.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, each verdict of a jury that tends to make our du-
</p>
<p>ties or our rights more complicated, involved, obscure, or perplexed
</p>
<p>tends to endanger the liberties we possess. The indictment here
</p>
<p>is solely for a conspiracy ; and I cannot praise it as a work of
</p>
<p>legal ingenuity or of art. You may imagine the legal artist possessed
</p>
<p>of much bodily strength, and armed with a huge scissors, files of
</p>
<p>the Nation, the Pilot, the Post, or the Mail, are placed before
</p>
<p>him. He applies himself to his task with no charitable spirit,
</p>
<p>but with considerable zeal. Speeches are stripped by him of
</p>
<p>all inoffensive matter; biting passages are cut out from leading arti-

</p>
<p>cles ; reports of public meetings, given more severely than the speakers
</p>
<p>of the several speeches intended; letters of angry correspondents,
</p>
<p>written at long intervals of time, are carefully selected and given in
</p>
<p>full. The prose of the indictment is embellished by a Transatlantic
</p>
<p>speech by the son of President Tyler; and the whole is wound up by
</p>
<p>a song. First come the proceedings at a great public meeting; then
</p>
<p>the speeches at a dinner, which is charged as an overt act ; then
</p>
<p>comes the editor of the Freeman, then the editor of the Pilot, who
</p>
<p>are charged with publishing them in pursuance of the conspiracy;
</p>
<p>then comes my client, the editor of the Nation, who is charged with
</p>
<p>having transcribed or copied them into his weekly paper. That disposes
</p>
<p>of one meeting ; then another meeting and another dinner are brought
</p>
<p>forward ; the three editors are again paraded in succession, and so
</p>
<p>on from March until October last year, the indictment giving and
</p>
<p>purporting to give what, by the way, may be very useful to the future
</p>
<p>historian, a narrative of all the public meetings and of all the good
</p>
<p>465
</p>
<p>dinners which took place in Ireland during a period of ten months.
</p>
<p>The indictment may be divided into two parts, the first consisting of
</p>
<p>the reports and copious details of speeches sufficient to fill several
</p>
<p>octavo volumes; the second part may be regarded as a formidable
</p>
<p>abridgment of the proceedings of the Association, the plan for the
</p>
<p>renewed action of the Irish Parliament, the leading articles in the
</p>
<p>Repeal newspapers, the angry letters of Priest Power, and other
</p>
<p>matters of a general and miscellaneous character, all forming this
</p>
<p>precious olio of an indictment. Gentlemen of the Jury, the guilt of
</p>
<p>any man must be difficult to be made out, if it requires a document
</p>
<p>of such extraordinary prolixity to explain it; and the innocence of
</p>
<p>that man would be clear indeed which such a mass of parchment is
</p>
<p>not calculated to endanger and obscure. Gentlemen, you are to un-
</p>
<p>derstand that the overt acts specified are not in themselves the spirit
</p>
<p>of the accusation ; each of these acts is not singly brought forward
</p>
<p>as the subject matter of a distinct charge or crime against the ac-
</p>
<p>cused; they are all used and brought forward as the proofs where-
</p>
<p>with to sustain the general crime in the indictment, which I have
</p>
<p>before stated, and which is the only question which you have to try.
</p>
<p>Now that crime I shall take the liberty to state to you. The tra-
</p>
<p>versers are accused of having conspired to excite " discontent and
</p>
<p>" disaffection amongst the liege subjects of our Lady the Queen, and
</p>
<p>" to excite such subjects to hatred and contempt of the Government
</p>
<p>" and Constitution of these realms as by law established, and to un-
</p>
<p>u lawful and seditious opposition to the said Government and Consti-
</p>
<p>" tution ; and also to stir up jealousies, hatred, and ill-will between
</p>
<p>" different classes of Her Majesty's subjects, and especially to pro-
</p>
<p>" mote amongst her Majesty's subjects in Ireland feelings of ill-will
</p>
<p>" and hostility towards and against Her Majesty's subjects in other
</p>
<p>" parts of the said United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and
</p>
<p>" especially in that part of the United Kingdom called England, &c,
</p>
<p>" and to promote disaffection in the army, and by the demonstration of
</p>
<p>" great physical force at their meetings, to bring about changes in the
</p>
<p>" Constitution and Government of the Tealm." They are also charged

</p>
<p>with having conspired to bring into disrepute the Courts of Justice,
</p>
<p>by the establishment of Arbitration Courts, and by inducing suitors
</p>
<p>to withdraw their cases from the lawful tribunals, and to have their
</p>
<p>differences adjusted by private individuals. That is the conspiracy
</p>
<p>charged, and that is the single crime which you have to try. You have
</p>
<p>to ascertain whether the accused are guilty of a conspiracy to do the
</p>
<p>precise acts, the very things, the specified things, the described
</p>
<p>things, set forth in this extraordinary, unprecedented, and unheard-
</p>
<p>of indictment.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the Attorney-General, who, I think, stated this
</p>
<p>case with great moderation and temper, and conducted it with
</p>
<p>fairness and candour, began his statement by a reference to
</p>
<p>the principles and authorities' which, he said, were necessary to
</p>
<p>explain the subject matter under consideration. There is not much
</p>
<p>dispute about the general principles of the law of conspiracy. It is
</p>
<p>3o
</p>
<p>466
</p>
<p>in the application of those principles that the difficulty lies ; and I
</p>
<p>do not see by what process of reasoning he has connected those prin-
</p>
<p>ciples with the evidence in this case, so as clearly to demonstrate their
</p>
<p>applicability to this particular charge of conspiracy. As to the defi-
</p>
<p>nition of conspiracy there can be no doubt ; it is a conspiracy to com-
</p>
<p>bine in order to accomplish an illegal object, or a legal object by
</p>
<p>illegal means.
</p>
<p>The first case cited by the Attorney-General was Rex v. Jones,
</p>
<p>4 Barn. & Aid. 345. That case has not the least analogy to the
</p>
<p>present case. It was an indictment against a man against whom
</p>
<p>a commission of bankruptcy had issued, for concealing part of his
</p>
<p>effects. The indictment did not show that the party had actually
</p>
<p>become a bankrupt, and it was held to be defective, on the ground
</p>
<p>that it did not disclose anything to constitute an offence. The second
</p>
<p>case quoted by the Attorney-General was Rex v. Forbes. I have
</p>
<p>only to say a word to the jury as to the subject matter of that case,
</p>
<p>to show, in passing, what may be treated as a conspiracy. Several
</p>
<p>persons combined for the common object of dining together at Daly's
</p>
<p>Club-house, and I believe they carried their object into execution ; they
</p>
<p>found it so merry a one that they further agreed to sup together, and I
</p>
<p>believe they pursued that object with the like perseverance and indus-
</p>
<p>try ; finally, they combined, confederated, conspired, and agreed to go to
</p>
<p>the play, and having done so, one had a rattle, and he rattled  ano-
</p>
<p>ther had a whistle, and he whistled  a third suffered his ultra-Pro-
</p>
<p>testant feelings to get so much the better of him, that he threw a
</p>
<p>bottle on the stage. An indictment for a conspiracy was sent up to
</p>
<p>the Grand Jury, but they ignored the bill. The Attorney-General
</p>
<p>then filed an ex officio information, the case was tried and there was
</p>
<p>no verdict, except in one case, that of Brownlow ; he was acquitted,
</p>
<p>and that conspiracy was never heard of from that hour to the present.
</p>
<p>The next case cited by the Attorney-General, was The Queen
</p>
<p>v. Murphy, 8 Carr. & Payne, 310, in which Mr. Justice Coleridge
</p>
<p>said : " You have been properly told that this being a charge of
</p>
<p>" conspiracy, if you are of opinion that the acts, though done, were
</p>

</p>
<p>" done without common consent and design between those two par-
</p>
<p>" ties, the present charge cannot be supported. On the other hand,
</p>
<p>" I am bound to tell you, that although the common design is the
</p>
<p>" root of the charge, it is not necessary to prove that these two par-
</p>
<p>" ties came together, and actually agreed, in terms, to have this com-
</p>
<p>" mon design and so pursue it by common means, and so to carry it
</p>
<p>" into execution. This is not necessary, because in many cases of
</p>
<p>" the most clearly established conspiracy, there are no means of
</p>
<p>" proving any such thing, and neither law nor common sense requires
</p>
<p>" that it should be proved. If you find that these two persons pur-
</p>
<p>" sued by their acts the same object, often by the same means, one
</p>
<p>" performing one part of an act, and the other another part of the
</p>
<p>" same act, so as to complete it, with^i view to the attainment of the
</p>
<p>" object which they were pursuing, you will be at liberty to draw the
</p>
<p>" conclusion that they have been engaged in a conspiracy to effect
</p>
<p>" that object." Now, my Lords, I have to observe that the object
</p>
<p>467
</p>
<p>pursued there was illegal. The traversers had agreed together to
</p>
<p>prevent the collection of a certain rate, and to deter a person from
</p>
<p>raising it  the object therefore was illegal, and the good sense of
</p>
<p>the charge is this, that if the Jury were satisfied that the persons
</p>
<p>charged with this illegal object did part of an act at one time, and
</p>
<p>part of an act at another time, that amounted to a conspiracy. Clear
</p>
<p>evidence was given in the case, and on that evidence there was a
</p>
<p>verdict.
</p>
<p>The next case cited was that of The Queen v. Vincent, 9 Carr. &
</p>
<p>Payne, 275. There are two cases of that name in the same volume
</p>
<p>one very long and good, the other very short and bad. The
</p>
<p>Attorney- General cited the bad one. In that case the first count
</p>
<p>charged that the defendants conspired " to excite discontent and
</p>
<p>" disaffection in the minds of the liege subjects of Her Majesty, to
</p>
<p>" hatred and contempt of the Government and Constitution of this
</p>
<p>" realm, and to unlawful and seditious opposition to such Government. '
</p>
<p>The second count was for "a conspiracy to induce and procure divers
</p>
<p>" large numbers of persons to assemble and meet together, for the
</p>
<p>" purpose of exciting terror and alarm in the minds of the Queen's
</p>
<p>" subjects, and by force of such terror and alarm, to procure great
</p>
<p>" changes to be made in the Constitution of the realm, as by law es-
</p>
<p>" tablished, and to annoy, alarm, disturb, and prejudice divers subjects
</p>
<p>" of the Queen, in the peaceable enjoyment of their property." In
</p>
<p>this count no overt act was charged. That is the accusation in this
</p>
<p>case. Evidence was given on the part of the prosecution, of violent
</p>
<p>speeches delivered by those who attended the Chartist meetings, to
</p>
<p>the multitudes assembled ; and I will call the attention of the Court
</p>
<p>to a particular part of the report of the case : '' On the part of the pro-
</p>
<p>" sedition, it was proposed to ask Mr. Roberts, the Superintendant of
</p>
<p>" Police at Pontypool, who attended several of the meetings, whe-
</p>
<p>" ther persons complained to him of being alarmed at those meetings.
</p>
<p>" Carringtun, for the defendant Edwards.  I submit that persons
</p>
<p>" who were alarmed, should be called to prove that fact, and that
</p>
<p>" what they said to Mr. Roberts is not receivable. Gurney, B.

</p>
<p>" The fact that persons made complaint to the Superintendant of Po-
</p>
<p>" lice, of alarm occasioned by these meetings, is receivable. The
</p>
<p>" evidence was received." That is, they asked the policeman whether
</p>
<p>any body in the kingdom complained of having felt alarm or appre-
</p>
<p>hension from the meetings. On this authority, it was competent for
</p>
<p>the Crown to ask the policemen who were produced before you,
</p>
<p>whether any person in the community felt any alarm or apprehen-
</p>
<p>sion from these meetings.
</p>
<p>The next case cited was, Rex v. Stone, 6 T. R. 528. In that
</p>
<p>case, evidence having been given to connect the prisoner with
</p>
<p>John Hinford Stone, who was, during the transaction, resident in
</p>
<p>France, and domiciled there with Jackson, and to shew they were
</p>
<p>engaged in a conspiracy to collect intelligence for the French Go-
</p>
<p>vernment, Lord Grenville, the Secretary of State for the Foreign
</p>
<p>Department, was called to prove that a letter of Jackson's, contain-
</p>
<p>ing treasonable information, had been transmitted to him from
</p>
<p>abroad, but in a confidential way, which made it impossible for
</p>
<p>4G8
</p>
<p>him to divulge by whom it was communicated. Adah- and Erskine
</p>
<p>objected on behalf of the prisoner, to the reading of the letter, as it
</p>
<p>had not been proved to have come to the hands or knowledge of the
</p>
<p>prisoner, and that nothing could be received to affect the prisoner,
</p>
<p>but his own acts. At first Lord Kenyon concurred on general prin-
</p>
<p>ciples, that the act done by one person could not be given in evi-
</p>
<p>dence against another ; but the next day he said, he had thought of
</p>
<p>the point, and that he was satisfied that the evidence was admissible ;
</p>
<p>but even when the act and letter of Jackson were given in evidence,
</p>
<p>the jury perceived the danger of finding one man guilty for the act
</p>
<p>of another, and they acquitted the prisoner.
</p>
<p>The next case referred to by the Attorney General was Re.vx. Red-
</p>
<p>head, 2b St.Tr. 1004. I wish to call your attention to the indictment to
</p>
<p>that case. It contained matter similar to that contained in this indict-
</p>
<p>ment, namely, inflammatory speeches, which were relied on in support
</p>
<p>of the charge of conspiracy, but all these speeches are explained by pro-
</p>
<p>per averments and inuendoes, containing the direct point and meaning
</p>
<p>which was proved at the trial. Certainly, they were scandalous pro-
</p>
<p>ductions ; but I wish to call the attention of the Court to the fact, that
</p>
<p>in that case not only was it averred and proved that the act was
</p>
<p>done, but also that it had the effect which it was asserted it had.
</p>
<p>In page 1020, the counsel for the Crown stated the fact which
</p>
<p>was afterwards proved, that pikes were prepared, as suggested in the
</p>
<p>libel, under the pretence, that it was perfectly right for men to pre-
</p>
<p>pare a pike for the innocent and justifiable purpose of self-defence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Law says : " The pikes will be produced to you, they are formed
</p>
<p>" in a way that might administer very effectual annoyance either to
</p>
<p>" the civil magistrate or troops, or anything else in case of resistance,
</p>
<p>" when they should break out into a public opposition to the coun-
</p>
<p>" try." My Lords, I have also to mention, that in page 1043 evi-
</p>
<p>dence was given of the tendency of the speeches, as pointed out in
</p>
<p>the inuendo, and in page 1010, evidence was also given of the making
</p>
<p>of pikes, and the furnishing a sufficient quantity of heads for them, to
</p>
<p>be made of steel. The Attorney-General more than once relied on a

</p>
<p>passage in the charge, to which I will call your attention. In page 1148
</p>
<p>Mr. Law says : " Let it not be said that the words slipped casually
</p>
<p>" from him, he must contemplate arming who approves of arms when
</p>
<p>" they are made. It is not on the loose words of a letter that I lay
</p>
<p>" a stress, he has one put in his hand, sent by an associate, upon
</p>
<p>" this record." Now, my Lords, the passage to which the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General referred is in page 1152, Mr. Justice Kooke says : "He
</p>
<p>" supported his speculative principles of Annual Parliaments and Uni-
</p>
<p>" versal Suffrage, and says, he has uttered no more than what may be
</p>
<p>" found in the speeches of such men as the late Lord Chatham, Lord
</p>
<p>" Camden, Sir George Saville, Archdeacon Paley and others, and it
</p>
<p>" is very true they have done so." My learned friend the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General did not read to you this : " and zve believe in charity
</p>
<p>that they have done so." That is not a very temperate observation
</p>
<p>for a Judge to make on the Bench, it is not such an observation as
</p>
<p>one would expect to find in a charge ; he then makes use of the
</p>
<p>other part of the sentence which the Attorney-General quoted,
</p>
<p>469
</p>
<p>" and if the conduct of the defendant here had been merely a specula-
</p>
<p>" tion of his own, it would have been a different thing, but when those
</p>
<p>" speculations are gone forth in a large assembly, it will be for you to
</p>
<p>" judge whether you will give him credit for the innocence of his exer-
</p>
<p>' tions, whether he did not address them with a view to inflame their
</p>
<p>" minds and their passions." I admit in that case there was a verdict of
</p>
<p>guilty. I do not precisely see the value of the distinction taken by
</p>
<p>the learned Judge, and adopted by the learned counsel in this case,
</p>
<p>that a .man may broach opinions in Parliament which another man
</p>
<p>cannot express out of it. I do not think there is any law to support
</p>
<p>such a proposition. If Lord Chatham was at liberty to express his
</p>
<p>opinion in Parliament, and if Archdeacon Paley was at liberty to
</p>
<p>write his  and they have done so, I do not know why a Judge
</p>
<p>should say to an unfortunate person in the dock, " I may believe
</p>
<p>" that what Lord Chatham spoke and Paley wrote, they honestly
</p>
<p>" believed, but it is impossible to believe that such a vulgar per-
</p>
<p>" son as you could be actuated by the same motives."
</p>
<p>My learned friend, the Attorney-General, next cited the case of
</p>
<p>Rex v. Watson, 32 St.Tr. 1, and called the attention of the Court to
</p>
<p>the statement of the law by Mr. Justice Bailey in his charge. " In
</p>
<p>" order to support these, it is not absolutely necessary that you
</p>
<p>" should have positive evidence from persons who heard them con-
</p>
<p>" suit, or from persons who heard them conspire, or even that you
</p>
<p>"should have evidence of an actual meeting for that purpose; if
</p>
<p>" you should find that there was a plan, and you shall be satisfied
</p>
<p>" from what was done that there must have been previous con-
</p>
<p>" sulfation and conspiracy, either by the persons who are the
</p>
<p>" objects of this charge or by persons engaged with them in the
</p>
<p>" same common purpose and design that will justify your finding the
</p>
<p>" conspiracy and consultation." In that case Sir Charles Weatherell
</p>
<p>defended Watson; and the jury, acting on that charge, thought fit to
</p>
<p>acquit the prisoner.
</p>
<p>The next case referred to was that of Redford v. Birlev, 3
</p>
<p>Stark. N. P. C. 76, and that case from beginning to end is in

</p>
<p>our favour. That was an action brought against the military who
</p>
<p>acted at Manchester, under the direction of the civil authorities. On
</p>
<p>the part of the defendants, Mr. Andrews was called as a witness, who
</p>
<p>stated that he lived within two miles of the town of Manchester, on
</p>
<p>the road between Manchester and Whitemoss. The counsel for the
</p>
<p>defendant were proceeding to examine him as to the fact of his hav-
</p>
<p>ing seen bodies of men on the night of the 14th or early on the
</p>
<p>morning of the 15th of August, marching along the road near his
</p>
<p>house, and as to expressions used by them, tending to show that they
</p>
<p>were proceeding to Whitemoss for the purpose of being drilled. That
</p>
<p>evidence was objected to and admitted by Mr. Justice Holroyd. In
</p>
<p>page 87 evidence is referred to as having been admitted of parties
</p>
<p>feeling terror and alarm at the meeting. In page 80 a witness states
</p>
<p>that he was asked whether he would go to get a big loaf for a little
</p>
<p>one ? and that he afterwards went to the Tandle Hill, where he found
</p>
<p>a number of people assembled ; that they said they would have a
</p>
<p>reform in Parliament ; that they would make the best of their way
</p>
<p>470
</p>
<p>to London ; and make use of the property of any one who had pro-
</p>
<p>perty as they went on the road ; and that afterwards about seven
</p>
<p>hundred of them proceeded to drill. Then a paper was produced,
</p>
<p>signed by a number of gentlemen from Manchester, expressing their
</p>
<p>apprehensions for the safety of the town. That paper was objected
</p>
<p>to and admitted in evidence. Mr. Justice Holroyd says : " It is to
</p>
<p>" be recollected that this is not an action against the magistrates, but
</p>
<p>" it is an action against four of the military who were called in by the
</p>
<p>" magistrates to assist the civil power." In a note to page 90 it is
</p>
<p>stated, that impressions of terror and alarm were made on the inha-
</p>
<p>bitants of the town of Manchester. In page 99, Mr. Justice Hol-
</p>
<p>royd says: "In one of the pleas the drillings are alleged, which are
</p>
<p>" stated to be clandestine. But whether they were clandestine or
</p>
<p>" not, if they were done for the purpose of overawing the Govern-
</p>
<p>" ment, or for the purpose of exciting tumult or resistance to the
</p>
<p>" civil power, they would be unlawful. It is also alleged that divers
</p>
<p>" of these conspirators, of whom part were the.persons drilled, in pur-
</p>
<p>" suance of the conspiracy, unlawfully, and armed with stones, blud-
</p>
<p>" geons and other offensive weapons, met with intent to carry into
</p>
<p>" effect the conspiracy." As to the unlawful assembly, he says :
</p>
<p>" If they come armed, or meet in such a way as to overawe and ter-
</p>
<p>" rify other persons, that of itself may perhaps, under such circum-
</p>
<p>" stances, be an unlawful assembly." Again, in page 106 : " If, from
</p>
<p>" the general appearance, and all its accompanying circumstances, it
</p>
<p>" is calculated to excite alarm and consternation, it is generally cri-
</p>
<p>" minal and unlawful, that is in all those persons who go for purposes
</p>
<p>" of that kind, disregarding the probable effect, and the probable
</p>
<p>" alarm and consternation; and whoever gives countenance thereto is
</p>
<p>" amenable as a criminal party. With a view to that, the evidence
</p>
<p>" of actual alarm, and absence or want of alarm, is material ; and that
</p>
<p>" has been the occasion of a great deal of evidence being admitted
</p>
<p>" regarding other persons' fears and apprehensions, and what
</p>
<p>" information was given to the magistrates, under which they,
</p>
<p>" whose duty it is to protect the King's subjects from all mis-

</p>
<p>" chief, in such a way and manner as is lawful, were to act."
</p>
<p>Then his Lordship makes these observations on Lord George Gor-
</p>
<p>don's case : " They were called for an ostensibly lawful purpose, and
</p>
<p>" there was of itself nothing further meant or intended, than to pe-
</p>
<p>" tition the House of Parliament to repeal Acts which were passed in
</p>
<p>" favour of the Roman Catholics. They met on that occasion in im-
</p>
<p>" mense numbers, but not so many as on the occasion on which we
</p>
<p>" are now unfortunately sitting. Lord George Gordon went up with
</p>
<p>" their petition to the House of Commons, and they accompanied
</p>
<p>" him there; so far there was nothing amiss;"  that is, 70,000 or
</p>
<p>80,000 persons meeting together and going with Lord George Gor-
</p>
<p>don to the House of Commons;  " except that being tumultuous it
</p>
<p>" was indiscreet, because it was going with a great number of persons,
</p>
<p>" which was tumultuous, or had the appearance of being so; and if
</p>
<p>" they were not satisfied with the result, some amongst them might
</p>
<p>" break out into acts of violence. On that occasion, they were not
</p>
<p>" satisfied with what was done in the House of Commons, and the re-
</p>
<p>471
</p>
<p>" suit was, that they went into different parts of London, and set fire
</p>
<p>" to Newgate, to some of the religious houses, to some of the Roman
</p>
<p>" Catholic houses, and among others, they opened the prison of the
</p>
<p>" King's Bench, I think, as well as Newgate. The consequence was,
</p>
<p>" the town was in riot and confusion three days ; till, at the expira-
</p>
<p>" tion of that time, the military were called in, and were obliged to do
</p>
<p>" military execution ; and I believe that some persons were engaged
</p>
<p>" in the work of conflagration at the time they arrived. Now, that
</p>
<p>" is a circumstance which some amongst us are old enough toremem-
</p>
<p>" ber, among others myself. Then the case of the meeting in Spa-
</p>
<p>" Fields affords another instance ; there the meeting was ostensibly
</p>
<p>" proper, but the consequences were mischievous ; persons broke
</p>
<p>" into houses, and much damage was done. I do not mention this
</p>
<p>" for any other purpose than to show that those things having hap-
</p>
<p>" pened within the memory of persons now living, it naturally makes
</p>
<p>i: magistrates more alert and on their guard when an immense number
</p>
<p>" of persons come together for the purpose of petitioning the Crown,
</p>
<p>" which they have a right to do, supposing they do not come under
</p>
<p>" circumstances which tend to inspire terror and alarm in the neigh-
</p>
<p>" bourhood, and are naturally calculated for the purpose." Much stress
</p>
<p>has been laid on the observations on the drilling, but I beg to state that
</p>
<p>LordWynford did not state that drillingis illegal, but he very cautiously
</p>
<p>guards against it ; he expressly says that drilling may be legal. That is
</p>
<p>what is called the positive opinion that drilling is an illegal act.
</p>
<p>My Lords, the case of Rex v. Hunt, 3 Barn. & Ald.^was a charge of
</p>
<p>conspiracy. The fourth count in the indictment was, that the traversers
</p>
<p>did, on the 16th day of August, unlawfully, maliciously, and sedi-
</p>
<p>tiously assemble together, and cause others to assemble to the number of
</p>
<p>60,000, in a formidable and menacing manner, with sticks, clubs, and
</p>
<p>otheroffensive weapons, with banners, flags, colours, and placards, havino-
</p>
<p>divers seditious and inflammatory inscriptions, and in martial array.
</p>
<p>The evidence, your Lordships will observe, is not given in Barnewall
</p>
<p>& Alderson ; but the result was, that Mr. Hunt was acquitted of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy, and found guilty of attending an unlawful assemblage. I

</p>
<p>will refer to the evidence, with the view of showing upon what evi-
</p>
<p>dence they acquitted him. In the biography of Mr. Hunt, the evi-
</p>
<p>dence at the trial is given at full length. The evidence against Mr
</p>
<p>Hunt referred to the Manchester meeting, and to a resolution which
</p>
<p>had been passed at it, and which had been previously passed at the
</p>
<p>Spafields meeting. That resolution was rather of a startling descrip-
</p>
<p>tion. It was, that if the grievances of the people were not redressed
</p>
<p>by a given day, they were to consider themselves as released from
</p>
<p>their allegiance. That was rather a bold step ; but the next project
</p>
<p>which they had in contemplation was more daring still, for they pro-
</p>
<p>posed to meet together on a given day, and to elect a member for
</p>
<p>Manchester without any writ being issued for that purpose. That
</p>
<p>meeting, however, was proclaimed to be illegal ; but they resolved to
</p>
<p>meet on the 16th of the month, after spending the whole of the ni-ht
</p>
<p>of the 15th in drilling. One of the witnesses examined on the part
</p>
<p>of the prosecution was a person of the name of Murray. His evi-
</p>
<p>472
</p>
<p>dence is given in page 295 of the second volume of Mr. Hunt's life.
</p>
<p>His evidence is as follows: " I live at Manchester; I know Mr.
</p>
<p>Shavvcross. I went with him on the night of the 14th of August.
</p>
<p>Mr. Rymer and hjs son were with us. We went to Whitemoss. We
</p>
<p>left Manchester on purpose to go there, and reached it by daylight.
</p>
<p>Hearing some persons near us shouting and hallooing, we lay down
</p>
<p>to prevent our being seen. We then got to the house where the
</p>
<p>men were drilling. There might be 600 or 800 of them. The plot
</p>
<p>of ground was square. They were in squads, and there was a drill
</p>
<p>sergeant at the bead or end of every squad. They were marching
</p>
<p>when I went up. I heard the words, 'march,' ' wheel,' ' halt.' It
</p>
<p>appeared like a camp ; the men obeyed the orders given to them.
</p>
<p>I remember the words ' eyes right,' ' dress,' and ' forward.' I was
</p>
<p>close amongst them on the left hand. The first words said to me
</p>
<p>were by a drill sergeant, who bade me fall in. I knew the man ;
</p>
<p>his name was Caterall. I said I thought 1 would fall in soon. The
</p>
<p>different sergeants began to shift their squads, and look steadfastly.
</p>
<p>I did not like their looks, and thought of shifting my ground, when
</p>
<p>I heard a cry of ' spy ;' it ran along the lines, and I heard the words
</p>
<p>' mill them, d  n them, mill them.' 1 then heard a cry of ' they are
</p>
<p>constables;' and the answer was, *d  n them, murder them.' I
</p>
<p>moved off, and so did Shawcross, but we were followed by eighty
</p>
<p>or ninety men. They overtook Shavvcross, beat him, and knocked
</p>
<p>him in the ditch. From twenty to thirty men followed and over-
</p>
<p>took me. They began to beat me with sticks, and kick me most
</p>
<p>violently with their clogs. I desired them to give over ; that that
</p>
<p>did not look like a reform in Parliament ; it was, I said, very differ-
</p>
<p>ent treatment from that received by prisoners of war." The man
</p>
<p>/as an old soldier. " They asked me how we would treat them if we
</p>
<p>took them prisoners at Manchester ? I said we would treat them
</p>
<p>as prisoners, and not murder them. They continued beating me,
</p>
<p>and one said, ' shall we kill him out and out, and put him in the
</p>
<p>pit, or let him go?' A man said, ' he has had enough ;' another,
</p>
<p>' if he has any more he'll die.' They then desisted and held a con-

</p>
<p>sultation, after which one of them asked me if I would consent
</p>
<p>to go down on my knees, and never be a King's man again, and
</p>
<p>never name the name of the King any more ? I said ' yes,' as I
</p>
<p>considered my life was in danger. I fell on my knees ; the words
</p>
<p>I now mentioned were proposed to me, and I repeated them. They
</p>
<p>then let me get up. One man struck me twice after I got up, and
</p>
<p>that was all. I went to Middleton, as I was unable to go to Man-
</p>
<p>chester. I was unable to stir after I got to bed. I was the next
</p>
<p>day removed to Manchester, where I was confined to my bed. On
</p>
<p>the next day, the 16th, I heard the sound of bugles, and on being
</p>
<p>removed to the window I heard the cry of ' halt !' The crowd then
</p>
<p>halted near my door. I looked out, and saw the streets filled with
</p>
<p>people. Those in the centre were in ranks, six abreast. The bugle
</p>
<p>was again sounded, and 1 heard the word ' march,' and the party
</p>
<p>moved on, and began to hiss very loud." In page 307, the evidence
</p>
<p>of John Ashworth is given ; he says : " I saw two divisions come to
</p>
<p>473
</p>
<p>" Oldham on the 16th of August, find join another division, which
</p>
<p>" came up before them. They formed together, and went on ten or
</p>
<p> twelve abreast to Manchester by the new road. They might bo
</p>
<p>" from 3,000 to 5,000 strong, exclusive of stragglers. Many called
</p>
<p>" out to me by name to go with them ; but I said they were a week
</p>
<p>" too soon forme; that I could not go till Saturday. Some of them
</p>
<p>" also said they would make a ' Moscow' of it before they came back.
</p>
<p>" This occurred at eight o'clock in the morning of the 1 6th."
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Burton.  What is the authority of that book ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside.  It is the Life and Memoirs of Henry Hunt.
</p>
<p>Evidence of apprehension and alarm was there given by several pro-
</p>
<p>fessional persons from Manchester. In page 349 tho flags are de-
</p>
<p>scribed. On some of the flags were these inscriptions: The Rights
</p>
<p>of Man  Let us die lihe Men, and not be sold like Slaves 
</p>
<p>Liberty is the Birthright of Man. A witness of the name of
</p>
<p>Ellis says : " I think the meeting was calculated to produce a most
</p>
<p>appalling effect on the minds of the inhabitants. Mr. Ilulton says,
</p>
<p>page '352 : " Undoubtedly there were several gentlemen who were
</p>
<p>" strongly impressed with fear and alarm. My own opinion was, that
</p>
<p>"the town was in the greatest danger." Mr. Justice Bayley, in his
</p>
<p>charge, savs : " With respect to the banners, I again observe, that
</p>
<p>" those only who show that they were favourable to any motto in-
</p>
<p>scribed on them, by carrying or immediately marching undor'them,
</p>
<p>" can be considered as liable to any penalty which the illegal nature
</p>
<p>" of any of the inscriptions may warrant." I call your Lordships'
</p>
<p>particular attention to that observation, because it was proved in this
</p>
<p>case that an arch was erected with a motto, which was relied on as
</p>
<p>proof of the criminal and illegal motives at that meeting. The learned
</p>
<p>Judge then " commented with severity upon the resolution that the
</p>
<p>" people were absolved from any obedience to the laws, except on
</p>
<p>" such conditions as was therein expressed, from and after the first
</p>
<p>" of January, 1820." On that charge and on those facts, Mr. Henry
</p>
<p>Hunt was acquitted of a criminal conspiracy, and found guilty only
</p>
<p>ofattending an unlawful assembly on the fourth count.

</p>
<p>The Attorney-General, I believe, did not rpjote the case of Rcgina
</p>
<p>v. Vincent, 9 Carr. & Payne, 91. I shall call your attention to the facts
</p>
<p>and to the law of it. The first count charges that the prisoners con-
</p>
<p>spired, together with divers other persons unknown, " unlawfully,
</p>
<p>maliciously, and seditiously to meet and assemble themselves, toge-
</p>
<p>ther with the said, &c , and the other conspirators, at, &c, for the
</p>
<p>purpose of exciting discontent and disaffection in the minds of the
</p>
<p>liege subjects of our said Lady the Queen, and for the purpose of
</p>
<p>moving and exciting the liege subjects of our said Lady the Queen
</p>
<p>to hatred and contempt of the Government and Constitution of this
</p>
<p>realm as by law established." The second count was similar, but
</p>
<p>stated, as an overt act of the conspiracy, that the conspirators assem-
</p>
<p>bled at Newport, on the 19th of April, 1839, to the number of
</p>
<p>2000 and more, in a menacing manner with offensive weapons,
</p>
<p>and did cause great terror and alarm to the peaceable and well-
</p>
<p>3p
</p>
<p>474
</p>
<p>disposed subjects of Her Majesty. The twelfth count was for a tu-
</p>
<p>multuous assembly. The thirteenth count stated that the defendants,
</p>
<p>" together with divers other evil- disposed persons to the jurors afore -
</p>
<p>" said unknown, to a great number, to wit to the number of 2000,
</p>
<p>" heretofore, to wit on, &c, with force and arms, at, &c, unlawfully
</p>
<p>" and in a tumultuous manner did meet and assemble themselves
</p>
<p>11 tog-ether, and being so met and assembled together, did then and
</p>
<p>" there unlawfully and tumultuously continue together for a long space
</p>
<p>" of time, to wit, for the space of four hours, near the dwelling-houses
</p>
<p>" of divers liege subjects of our Lady the Queen, inhabiting within the
</p>
<p>" said town, and also in diversstreetsand common highways, there mak-
</p>
<p>" ing loud exclamations, cries, and noises, to the great terror, annoyance,
</p>
<p>" and disturbance of many of the liege, peaceable, and quietsubjects of
</p>
<p>" oursaid Lady the Queen, to the great damage, &c, and against the
</p>
<p>" peace, &c." The thirteenth count was for a riot. What was the evidence
</p>
<p>in support of this indictment? Mr. Thomas Phillips, the Mayor
</p>
<p>of Newport, says : " In consequence of information I received on
</p>
<p>" the 19th of March last, I directed the Superintendant of Police
</p>
<p>" to go to Pentonville to protect persons and property." Evidence
</p>
<p>of alarm and danger to the public peace was also given by Mr. Webber
</p>
<p>and by Mr. Fraser. Then comes an important piece of evidence, which
</p>
<p>I think is well worth your attention. It is the evidence of Mr. John-
</p>
<p>son. " I am a commercial traveller. On the 27th of April I called
</p>
<p>" on Mr. Townsend. After business, he asked me what I thought
</p>
<p>" of the Chartists in Lancashire. I said I pitied them, as they were
</p>
<p>" the deluded victims of designing knaves, who had no character or
</p>
<p>" property to lose, but who sought to excite the people to rebellion,
</p>
<p>" in the hope that in a general scramble they should get something.
</p>
<p>" 1 asked if they had many Chartists about Newport. He said they
</p>
<p>" had a great many, and that at a meeting just held they had beaten
</p>
<p>" or frightened the magistrates, and he said he was the treasurer of the
</p>
<p>" body. I said in a careless way, that if we had been in our former
</p>
<p>" trade we might have turned it to a pecuniary profit. He inquired
</p>
<p>" what it was, and I said we had been in the trade of supplying the

</p>
<p>" African chiefs with muskets, cutlasses, and pistols. He asked me
</p>
<p>" the prices, and said he would give me an order, and pay cash for
</p>
<p>" them, as he was treasurer of the body. I asked to what extent his
</p>
<p>" order would go, and he replied, 200 to 300 muskets, 500 to 600 cut-
</p>
<p>u lasses, and pistols in proportion, and he added : ' You must undertake
</p>
<p>" the delivery at Newport.' I said seriously, for I spoke jocularly be-
</p>
<p>" fore, thatwe would not supply arms for such an abominable purpose."
</p>
<p>Baron Alderson, in summing up, said : " I take it to be the law of
</p>
<p>" the land, that any meeting assembled under such circumstances as,
</p>
<p>" according to the opinion of rational and firm men, are likely to pro-
</p>
<p>" duce danger to the tranquillity and peace of the neighbourhood, is
</p>
<p>" an unlawful assembly. You will have to say, whether, looking to
</p>
<p>" all the circumstances, these defendants attended an unlawful assem-
</p>
<p>" bly, and for this purpose you will take into your consideration the
</p>
<p>" way in which the meetings were held, the hour of the day at which
</p>
<p>475
</p>
<p>" the parties met, and the language used by the persons assembled,
</p>
<p>" and by those who addressed them. Every one has a right to act in
</p>
<p>" such cases as he may judge right, provided it be not injurious to
</p>
<p>" another ; but no man, or number of men, has a right to cause alarm
</p>
<p>" to the body of persons who are called the public. You will consi-
</p>
<p>" der how far these meetings partook of that character, and whether
</p>
<p>" firm and rational men, having their families and properties there,
</p>
<p>" would have reasonable ground to fear a breach of the peace ; for I
</p>
<p>" quite agree with the learned counsel, that the alarm must not be
</p>
<p>" merely such as would frighten any foolish or timid person, but must
</p>
<p>M be such as would alarm persons of reasonable firmness and courage.
</p>
<p>" The indictment also contains charges of conspiracy, which is a crime
</p>
<p>" which consists either in a combination and agreement by persons to
</p>
<p>" do some illegal act, or a combination and agreement to effect a legal
</p>
<p>" purpose by illegal means. The purposes which the defendants had
</p>
<p>" in view, as stated by the prosecutor, was to excite disaffection and
</p>
<p>" discontent ; but the defendants say that their purpose was, by reason-
</p>
<p>" able argument and proper petitions, to obtain the five points men-
</p>
<p>" tioned by their learned counsel. If that was so, I think it by no
</p>
<p>" means illegal to petition on these points. The duration of Parlia-
</p>
<p>" ments,and the extent of the elective franchise, have undergone more
</p>
<p>" than one change by the authority of Parliament itself; and with regard
</p>
<p>" to voting by ballot, persons whose opinions are entitled to the highest
</p>
<p>" respect are in favour of it. There can also be no illegality in petitioning,
</p>
<p>" that members of Parliament should be paid for their services by their
</p>
<p>" constituents. Indeed, they were so paid in ancient times, and they
</p>
<p>" were not required to have a property qualification till the reign of
</p>
<p>" Queen Anne, and are not now required to have it in order to repre-
</p>
<p>" sent any part of Scotland or the English Universities. If, however,
</p>
<p>" the defendants say that they will effect those changes by physical
</p>
<p>" force, that is an offence against the law of the country. No civil-
</p>
<p>" ized state can exist if changes are to be effected in the law by phy-
</p>
<p>" sical force. And yet eminent persons have done so, as the learned
</p>
<p>" counsel has stated, and their conduct was to come before us in a

</p>
<p>" Court of Justice. We should (however painful it would be to be
</p>
<p>" placed in such a situation) act towards them also exactly as we
</p>
<p>" ought now to act against the present defendants. With regard to the
</p>
<p>" speeches of the defendants at these meetings, I entirely agree with
</p>
<p>" the observations of the learned counsel, that nothing is more unfair
</p>
<p>" than taking apart of a speech without the fair context; and you
</p>
<p>" will, therefore, take the whole that is proved, and consider whether
</p>
<p>" anything else that was said altered the effect of the passages relied
</p>
<p>" on by the prosecution. You will say whether you are satisfied that
</p>
<p>11 the defendants conspired to excite disaffection. If you are so,
</p>
<p>" you will find the defendants guilty of the conspiracy." The re-
</p>
<p>sult was, that on this evidence the jury found a verdict of not
</p>
<p>guilty of a conspiracy, and guilty of attending an unlawful assem-
</p>
<p>bly. I will draw your attention to the last passage in Baron
</p>
<p>476
</p>
<p>Alderson's charge to the Grand Jury : " Let me not, however, be
</p>
<p>" misunderstood. There is no doubt that the people of this country
</p>
<p>" have a perfect right to meet for the purpose of stating what are,
</p>
<p>" or even what they consider to be, their grievances. That right
</p>
<p>" they always have had, and I trust always will have; but in order
</p>
<p>" to transmit that right unimpaired to posterity, it is necessary that
</p>
<p>" it should be regulated by law and restrained by reason. There-
</p>
<p>" fore let them meet, if they will, in open day, peaceably and qui-
</p>
<p>" etly ; and they would do wisely when they meet, to do so under
</p>
<p>" the sanction of those who are the constituted authorities of the
</p>
<p>" country. To meet under irresponsible presidency is a dangerous
</p>
<p>" thing ; nevertheless, if, when they do meet under that irrespon-
</p>
<p>" sible presidency, they conduct themselves with peace, tranquillity,
</p>
<p>" and order, they will perhaps lose their time, but nothing else.
</p>
<p>" They will not put other people into alarm, terror, and consterna-
</p>
<p>" tion ; they will probably in the end come to the conclusion that
</p>
<p>" they have acted foolishly. The Constitution of this country does
</p>
<p>" not, thank God, punish persons who, meaning to do what is right
</p>
<p>" in a peaceable, orderly manner, are only in error in the views which
</p>
<p>" they have taken on some subject of political interest."
</p>
<p>My Lords, the last case I shall trouble you with is the report of
</p>
<p>the trials of the Chartists. It was also a charge of conspiracy, and it is
</p>
<p>remarkable for the clear, distinct, and accurate statement of the law by
</p>
<p>Baron Rolfe. The Chartists were accused of a conspiracy. The people
</p>
<p>went about destroying mills, injuring property, and forcing men not
</p>
<p>to attend to their work. Feargus O'Connor was one of the persons
</p>
<p>indicted. He was at the time the proprietor of the Northern Star,
</p>
<p>and he was indicted in a separate count for writing an article in his
</p>
<p>paper, in which he seemed to advise the people to stay out. A sepa-
</p>
<p>rate count to meet his case was put into the indictment ; that is to
</p>
<p>say, he was not made responsible for what resulted before he had
</p>
<p>written this article ; he was only to suffer for what he had done him-
</p>
<p>self. I have heard the doctrine stated here, that a person who joins
</p>
<p>an association is responsible for an act which may have been done by

<p>it two years before. I will not trouble the Court by reading this
</p>
<p>evidence ; I will merely send it up to the Bench. However, at
</p>
<p>Preston the military fired on the people. I will now call your atten-
</p>
<p>tion to the admirable summary of the facts and law, as laid down by the
</p>
<p>learned Judge; in page 358 the charge is reported. The learned Judge
</p>
<p>says: "Gentlemen, you have been told over and over again, what
</p>
<p>" no doubt is the fact, that what these defendants stand charged
</p>
<p>" with is the crime of conspiracy, and with that only. There were
</p>
<p>" originally other charges in the indictment, which it is not necessary
</p>
<p>" to discuss, as they have been withdrawn. What I would now call
</p>
<p>" your attention to is the charge of conspiracy, and that alone. What
</p>
<p>" then is that act or those acts which in the eye of the law constitute
</p>
<p>" conspiracy? It has been said that there is great difficulty in this
</p>
<p>" subject ,and great con fusion in explaining what constitutes conspiracy.
</p>
<p>,( I do not see those difficulties to the same extent as thcv have been
</p>
<p>477
</p>
<p>" suggested by others. Doubtless cases may arise in which it might
</p>
<p>" be difficult to say, if certain acts constituted conspiracy, why they
</p>
<p>" do ; but in the present case, there can be no difficulty at all ; be-
</p>
<p>" cause, for the purpose of this investigation, it is quite sufficient for
</p>
<p>" us to define conspiracy as being a combination of two or more per-
</p>
<p>" sons, either to do or to cause others to do an illegal act, or to bring
</p>
<p>" about a legal act by illegal means." The learned Judge then pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to state the charges in the indictment, the first count of which
</p>
<p>was, that Feargus O'Connor conspired, &c, by causing to be brought
</p>
<p>together divers unlawful, tumultuous, and riotous assemblies, of sedi-
</p>
<p>tious and evil disposed persons, and by forcing and compelling divers
</p>
<p>of Her Majesty's peaceable subjects, then employed in their respective
</p>
<p>trades, to desist and to depart from their work, and by divers sedi-
</p>
<p>tious and inflammatory speeches, &c, to create alarm, discontent, and
</p>
<p>confusion, with intent thereby unlawfully to effect and bring about a
</p>
<p>change in the laws and Constitution of this realm. The second count
</p>
<p>charged a conspiracy by force and violence, creating alarm, to cause
</p>
<p>changes in the laws and Constitution of the country. The fifth count
</p>
<p>stated, " That Feargus O'Connor, with divers persons unknown, con-
</p>
<p>" spired to excite the Queen's subjects to disaffection and hatred of
</p>
<p>u her laws." The learned Judge, with regard to this charge, says :
</p>
<p>" Standing alone, that is nothing ; these are mere idle words. You
</p>
<p>" cannot charge persons with exciting hatred to the laws  for how is
</p>
<p>" that done? You must have it explained. By what means is that
</p>
<p>" done? You must put that out of the question. By endeavouringto
</p>
<p>" persuade the Queen's subjects to unite, confederate, and agree to leave
</p>
<p>" their employments, and produce a cessation of labour through a large
</p>
<p>" portion of the realm, with intent therebytobringabout a change in the
</p>
<p>" Jaws and Constitution." He then says : " You have heard it stated
</p>
<p>" by one of the learned counsel at the bar, that a difference of opinion
</p>
<p>" exists among very high legal authorities, as to whether, under the
</p>
<p>" comparatively recent Acts of Parliament passed on the subject of
</p>
<p>" combinations among workmen, the merely persuading l people
</p>
<p>" not to work till the Charter became the law of the land, is or is not

<p>" criminal; for the purpose of this inquiry, I should distinctly tell you
</p>
<p>" to consider it criminal  for this reason, that one of the counts in the
</p>
<p>" indictment charges no other criminality but that. And if you should
</p>
<p>" be of opinion, in reference to all or any of the defendants, that that is
</p>
<p>" all of which they have been guilty, then you will find them guilty on
</p>
<p>" that count only ; and it will be then for the Court of Queen's Bench
</p>
<p>" to say, whether that count does or does not bring them within any
</p>
<p>" thing criminal according to the true construction of the law." In
</p>
<p>page 362 : " The charge, be it always present to your minds, is not
</p>
<p>" that of having attended illegal meetings, of having uttered seditious
</p>
<p>" speeches, or of having turned workmen from their employment, or
</p>
<p>" of having caused tumult, violence, or outrage; and if the defendants,
</p>
<p>" or any of them, have been guilty of any of those, they are still liable
</p>
<p>" to be indicted for such offence, and their conviction or acquittal on
</p>
<p>" this indictment will neither protect nor hurt them, but the sole
</p>
<p>" charge here is, that they combined and conspired together to
</p>
<p>478
</p>
<p>" effectuate certain objects ; if they did so, from that moment
</p>
<p>" the crime here charged is complete, even though not a single man
</p>
<p>" has turned out, or a single outrage been committed. On the other
</p>
<p>" hand, if there was a conspiracy, and that some who took part in the
</p>
<p>" proceedings resulting from it were ignorant of the conspiracy and
</p>
<p>" the object of it, they are no more guilty of the charge contained
</p>
<p>" in this indictment than those who took no part in it, not having en-
</p>
<p>" tered into a combination or agreement. That being so, I say the
</p>
<p>< difficulty at the very outset likely to present itself to the minds of
</p>
<p>" those considering subjects of this sort for the first time is, that if the
</p>
<p>" crime consists in the agreement to do certain unlawful acts, how are
</p>
<p>" we to find that any such agreement has been entered into ? In the
</p>
<p>" ordinary transactions of life, when parties enter into an agreement,
</p>
<p>" they manifest it by reducing it to writing, or by making it verbally
</p>
<p>" amongst themselves, and the evidence of the writing or the person
</p>
<p>" who heard the agreement made will be sufficient to substantiate it.
</p>
<p>" But in order to convict persons of a conspiracy must we have the
</p>
<p>" same sort of evidence ? must we find the parties reducing to writing
</p>
<p>" what they conspired to do ? or must we have the evidence of some-
</p>
<p>'' body who was present and heard them when they were entering into
</p>
<p>" the compact ? Certaiidy not. Perhaps the most satisfactory evi-
</p>
<p>" dence would be that of persons who were present when the in-
</p>
<p>" dividuals charged with the crime had entered into the agree-
</p>
<p>" ment, or when they did that which clearly amounted to such
</p>
<p><' an agreement; but this is by no means necessary. You may con-
</p>
<p>" vict parties of conspiring together to effect a certain purpose,
</p>
<p>" although you may have no writing to show such combination or
</p>
<p>" agreement, or although you may not have the evidence of any
</p>
<p>" who was present and heard such agreement when it was entered into.
</p>
<p>" You may infer that there was such an agreement, from the acts which
</p>
<p>" the parties committed. In the reply of the Attorney General yes-
</p>
<p>" terday, he was alluding in some degree to this view of the case. I
</p>
<p>" think his language went beyond what I have stated to you the law
</p>
<p>" would warrant. Probably he meant the same thing that I did, but I

</p>
<p>" think the expression made use of was calculated to mislead. He
</p>
<p>" stated in substance  these are not his exact words  that if these
</p>
<p>" parties were going about lecturing and exciting parties to all those
</p>
<p>" acts referred to in the charge, and if they were all recommending the
</p>
<p>" same line of conduct, that that would amount to a conspiracy. The
</p>
<p>" only qualification I put on that, in laying down the law, is this, that
</p>
<p>" that would not amount to conspiracy at all. It might be evidence
</p>
<p>" from which you might infer a previous combination ; it might be
</p>
<p>" evidence leading more or less forcibly to that conclusion, according
</p>
<p>" to all the surrounding circumstances." Then, my Lords, he says :
</p>
<p>" As to a great many of these defendants, there will be no other evi-
</p>
<p>" dence whatever, at least that I have been able to discover, of pre-
</p>
<p>" vious combination or agreement to carry out any of these illegal
</p>
<p>" purposes, except so far as it is to be inferred from their acts in en-
</p>
<p>" deavouring to carry the strike out. With regard to others of
</p>
<p>" the defendants, so far from that being the case, it is quite clear
</p>
<p>479
</p>
<p>" they took no part at all in the actual carrying out of the strike,
</p>
<p>" and the only evidence against them would be (I allude particularly
</p>
<p>11 to what were called the delegates in Scholefield chapel), their meet-
</p>
<p>" ing together, and entering into resolutions and transactions of that
</p>
<p>tf meeting. So that as to a portion of the defendants, you will have
</p>
<p>" to convict them (if you do convict them), on one sort of evidence,
</p>
<p>" the inference from their acts." In page 375 : " In order to con-
</p>
<p>" vict parties of such a charge, you must show such acts perpetrated
</p>
<p>u by them, as indicate such a complete union of design as makes it
</p>
<p>** impossible not to see there must have been some combination be-
</p>
<p>" forehand ; not, perhaps, all meeting together, but one saying to
</p>
<p>" another : ' Well, we will go to such and such a place, and we will get
</p>
<p>" John Smith to go to such and such a place, and do so and so.' It
</p>
<p>11 might be proved either that such was the case, or by distinct tes-
</p>
<p>" timony of meeting, combining, and arranging to carry such things
</p>
<p>" into effect." His Lordship made some observations on the devices
</p>
<p>on banners and flags, to which I will call attention ; he says : '' If a
</p>
<p>u placard has no serious mischief in it, and merely some expression
</p>
<p>" which I dare say the writer thought very sublime; it would be a
</p>
<p>" great deal too much to dwell with too much minuteness on an ex-
</p>
<p>" pression of that sort, in reference to a crime of that magnitude,
</p>
<p>" which you have now to consider I can quite pardon the ex-
</p>
<p>" pression : ' Leave the decision to the God of justice and of battle.'
</p>
<p>" But what is the meaning of this, which I marked, when the placard
</p>
<p>" was sent up to me, as being, I must say, the worst part of the ad-
</p>
<p>" dress? 'Englishmen, the blood of your brothers reddens the
</p>
<p>" ' streets of Preston and Blackburn, and the murderers thirst for
</p>
<p>" ' more.' That is only vulgar and inflammatory ; but now what do
</p>
<p>" you make of this ? ' Peace, law, and order have prevailed on our
</p>
<p>" side.' That struck me as one of the most important statements in
</p>
<p>" the placard, because it led me to the conclusion that the persons
</p>
<p>" who prepared and issued it, did not think it any breach of the
</p>
<p>" peace, law, and order, to commit the outrages of which they
</p>
<p>" must have been cognizant, of which charity itself would hardly

</p>
<p>" suppose that those who drew up the address were aware."
</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen of the Jury, having stated the principles to the
</p>
<p>Court, I come to the facts of this case, which from the singular atten-
</p>
<p>tion you have paid to this trial, cannot have escaped your notice. Let
</p>
<p>us see what is found in this indictment before we proceed further.
</p>
<p>According to the principles which I have stated to the Court, your
</p>
<p>duty is to find what the parties have done. What is it? that they
</p>
<p>agreed on a political question?  No. Is it, that they combined to
</p>
<p>carry out their views on that subject ?  No : but that they confede-
</p>
<p>rated and conspired, by a complete union of purpose  by unity of de-
</p>
<p>sign  by a prearranged and preconcerted plan, to do all the acts set
</p>
<p>out in the indictment. If you find them guilty on one count of the
</p>
<p>indictment ; if you find them all guilty, you must find them guilty of
</p>
<p>having done the things specified in that count, with the intent laid in
</p>
<p>that count, for the illegal object specified in that count, and none
</p>
<p>other.
</p>
<p>480
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin.  You do not mean that the jury are to
</p>
<p>find that the traversers committed every overt act?
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside.  No, my Lord, but they must find them all guilty
</p>
<p>on one count, of one and the same conspiracy. The conspiracy is
</p>
<p>distinct from the overt acts. .
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Burton.  In what way is the trial of Mr. Feargus
</p>
<p>O'Connor authenticated ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  It is published by Mr. Feargus O'Connor him-
</p>
<p>self. It was taken in shorthand by himself, and published. He states
</p>
<p>that he was quite satisfied that he had been convicted according to
</p>
<p>law.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, the overt acts are perfectly distinct
</p>
<p>from the conspiracy. They are the matters put forward to establish
</p>
<p>the conspiracy. You must be satisfied, in order to find a verdict of
</p>
<p>guilty, that it is impossible that the traversers could have done those
</p>
<p>acts except for the purpose of carrying out that complete, fixed, and
</p>
<p>settled combination, confederation, and agreement, specified in the
</p>
<p>indictment. The Attorney-General may make out this conspiracy
</p>
<p>in one of two ways,  by positive proof that the eight traversers
</p>
<p>entered into a conspiracy to do those acts, or by inference, from the
</p>
<p>several matters which have been given in evidence before you.
</p>
<p>There is no evidence to show an express agreement to do those
</p>
<p>things. I therefore come at once to the consideration of the second
</p>
<p>part of the case, that is to say, can you infer from the evidence that
</p>
<p>there was a previously arranged plan to do these things? The object
</p>
<p>of my client is to accomplish the repeal of a certain Act of Par-
</p>
<p>liament, called the Act of Union. That object is perfectly legal.
</p>
<p>No Parliament can make a law that another Parliament cannot unmake.
</p>
<p>The Legislature of one period cannot bind and fetter the Legislature
</p>
<p>of another period. If it was so, absurd and cruel laws would become
</p>
<p>perpetual, and oppress posterity. It was not even asserted in this
</p>
<p>case that an agreement to procure a Repeal of the Union was not a
</p>
<p>legal object; therefore, if you, Gentlemen, agreed for that purpose,
</p>
<p>and one of you did an unjustifiable, illegal, and unwarrantable act,

</p>
<p>even in pursuance of the common and legal object for which you are
</p>
<p>combined together, that does not make your previous agreement il-
</p>
<p>legal ; nor are those amongst you who agreed to a legal object to be
</p>
<p>visited with that illegal act. A great body of evidence has been ten-
</p>
<p>dered and received in this case. The act of Mr. Duffy is received
</p>
<p>because he is on trial, the act of Mr. O'Connell is received because
</p>
<p>he is on trial, the act of Dr. Gray is received for the same reason,
</p>
<p>and the speeches of Mr. Steele; but if my client agreed with them
</p>
<p>for a legal and constitutional purpose he cannot be made accountable
</p>
<p>for the intemperate effusions which he never combined or agreed
</p>
<p>should be spoken. Those acts cannot fix guilt on my client,
</p>
<p>unless it be clearly proved that they were done in pursuance of the
</p>
<p>common object  that common object being to effect a Repeal of the
</p>
<p>Union not by lawful means, but by unlawful violence, and by some of
</p>
<p>the absurd means stated in the indictment, and none other. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, I freely admit that while an object may appear to be lawful,
</p>
<p>the means resorted to in order to effect it may be unlawful, and
</p>
<p>481
</p>
<p>therefore I at once come to the consideration of what those illegal
</p>
<p>and criminal means are, by which it is alleged the traversers sought
</p>
<p>to carry out this originally legal object. And I will first draw your
</p>
<p>attention to the vast meetings which were held in different parts of
</p>
<p>the country, and will consider the general character of those meetings
</p>
<p>in mass. They began on the 19th of March, 1843, and ended in
</p>
<p>October of the same year. I exclude from this general considera-
</p>
<p>tion all the meetings of the Association ; and I will just observe in
</p>
<p>passing that there is no complaint of these meetings as unlawful as-
</p>
<p>semblies in themselves  there is no charge of riot, or of a breach of
</p>
<p>the peace, or tendency to it  no injury to property, no assault on any
</p>
<p>person  and therefore, strange enough, you are required to believe
</p>
<p>that attending at those meetings, or causing those meetings to be
</p>
<p>held, not for an unlawful purpose, because the purpose was to ob-
</p>
<p>tain a Repeal of the Union, are overt acts proving a general
</p>
<p>conspiracy. These meetings were quite consistent with the
</p>
<p>previous agreement of opinion on the subject of the Repeal of
</p>
<p>the Union, they were the necessary result of that agreement ; and
</p>
<p>because the object was to carry the Repeal of the Union by the only
</p>
<p>means by which it could be carried, by a concentration of moral opi-
</p>
<p>nion. I care not for those preposterous words in the indictment,
</p>
<p>" demonstration of physical force," they are not explained  there is
</p>
<p>nothing to lead the understanding to what they mean. Because these
</p>
<p>large numbers of people assembled together, you are called on to
</p>
<p>come to the conclusion that these very meetings are overt acts to
</p>
<p>prove a conspiracy. A few words as to the numbers at those meet-
</p>
<p>ings. I have already read to you the language of one learned Judge :
</p>
<p>" God be thanked, it has never been questioned that the right of the
</p>
<p>' people of England to petition is their ancient, undoubted, and un-
</p>
<p>" questionable privilege." Well, the people may meet to petition,
</p>
<p>let me ask you in what numbers may they meet ? Where is the
</p>
<p>line to be drawn between the number which makes a meeting lawful
</p>
<p>and the number which turns the same into an unlawful meeting.
</p>
<p>Is it to depend upon the weather whether a meeting is lawful or un-

</p>
<p>lawful ? Is a meeting of 20,000 men unlawful ? Is a meeting of 10,000
</p>
<p>men unlawful? Was the meeting at Hillsborough, some years ago,
</p>
<p>unlawful ? Is it unlawful for 75,000 men to meet for the purpose
</p>
<p>of petitioning for a Repeal of the Union, and lawful for the same
</p>
<p>number to meet, in order to petition for the maintenance of the
</p>
<p>Union? If that be stated and asserted to be law, I can only repeat
</p>
<p>that the law of England has ceased to be the rule of reason. The
</p>
<p>circumstance of the number of persons, I admit, may be an impor-
</p>
<p>tant element for your consideration, if there be reason to entertain
</p>
<p>alarm and terror from the meeting. But if persons meet together in
</p>
<p>peace, sobriety, and order, and conduct themselves at the meeting
</p>
<p>with propriety and decorum, and separate peaceably, and return to
</p>
<p>their homes with tranquillity, I require the Solicitor-General, since
</p>
<p>questions have been put to us in the progress of this trial, to state to
</p>
<p>you whether he requires twelve men, administering the law of Eng-
</p>
<p>land, to adopt the monstrous doctrine laid down by the Attorney-
</p>
<p>3q
</p>
<p>482
</p>
<p>General, that the more profound the tranquillity, the greater the
</p>
<p>peace, the more perfect the order, the greater the illegality  the
</p>
<p>more complete the determination not to violate the law, the more
</p>
<p>incontestible the proof of crime and of conspiracy. If men resolve
</p>
<p>not to break the law, but to assert their rights by legal means  not to
</p>
<p>assail personal liberty, or personal property, I want to know how these
</p>
<p>several circumstances can make out byjust, sensible, or intelligible argu-
</p>
<p>ment, that the particular conspiracy laid in the indictment is proved?
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I think I can say with truth, that these
</p>
<p>meetings are disliked by kings and ministers. Men born to com-
</p>
<p>mand dislike to hear the language of the people expressing in tones of
</p>
<p>indignation their grievances or their wrong ? Such sounds startle their
</p>
<p>ears and disturb the serenity of a court. Ministers disrelish public
</p>
<p>meetings at which the people may express their grievances or their
</p>
<p>wrongs, and state that they are not well governed, because they
</p>
<p>thereby pronounce a censure more or less upon those to whom the
</p>
<p>government of the country is intrusted ; for ministers are more
</p>
<p>or less affected by the opinions of the mass of the people for whom
</p>
<p>all Governments are instituted. Declarations of the people that
</p>
<p>they are not satisfied, that their grievances ought to be redressed,
</p>
<p>involve more or less censure, and therefore ministers dislike such
</p>
<p>meetings. A meeting trifling and contemptible in numbers will
</p>
<p>pass unobjected to and will produce no effect. Try it by this test :
</p>
<p>suppose the twelve gentlemen whom I have the honour to address
</p>
<p>agree in opinion on some question  a fiscal question, or any other
</p>
<p>in which they may be interested  and hold a meeting ; let your ar-
</p>
<p>guments be the most convincing, your facts incontrovertible, your
</p>
<p>reasons overwhelming, still your meeting would be treated with con-
</p>
<p>tempt by the Press, and your observations would produce no effect.
</p>
<p>Suppose 1200 men meet to express their opinions, the Reporters will
</p>
<p>flock to hear them, the speeches will be reported, and the arguments
</p>
<p>will reach the public ; their resolutions will find their way to the
</p>
<p>minister of the day ; he begins to see what is the bearing of the
</p>
<p>public mind on the particular question, his slow and immoveable na-

</p>
<p>ture is stirred up. Suppose instead of 1200, that 12000 persons meet,
</p>
<p>what is the result ? Suppose they do not prevail by their first
</p>
<p>meeting, and they meet a second, a third, and a fourth time, and say,
</p>
<p>in plain and unmistakeable words that their grievances must be redress-
</p>
<p>ed ; that the minister must consider the cause of complaint ; that it
</p>
<p>must be discussed ; that he must not treat their arguments with con-
</p>
<p>tempt but listen to reason, and that if those arguments are well found-
</p>
<p>ed they must prevail  what would be the result of such a meeting ?
</p>
<p>Would it not produce important results ? Would it not, at all events,
</p>
<p>draw the atention of the Government and the Parliament to their
</p>
<p>grievances and their wants ? They would not be conspirators because
</p>
<p>they agreed in their common object of endeavouring to get their grie-
</p>
<p>vances redressed  they would not be conspirators although one of the
</p>
<p>12,000 made use of intemperate or violent language, and although
</p>
<p>some wicked incendiary disseminated^through the meeting some scan-
</p>
<p>dalous or seditious production, which was never known or adopted by
</p>
<p>483
</p>
<p>the meeting. Gentlemen, the humbler classes of the community have
</p>
<p>the same right to meet as you have. No difference between you and
</p>
<p>them is known to or recognized by the law or Constitution of this
</p>
<p>country. Their opinion is not equivalent to the opinion of men who
</p>
<p>are in the same rank as your's  they must therefore compensate for
</p>
<p>the loss of moral weight by the addition of greater numbers. If they
</p>
<p>meet and express their opinions peaceably, and if the Reporters
</p>
<p>who were sent here from England were astonished at the peace, or-
</p>
<p>der, and good conduct observed by the savages who inhabit this part
</p>
<p>of the empire, then those meetings are as legal as your's would be.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I will now call your attention to a few of the great
</p>
<p>public meetings which have taken place in England, and which were
</p>
<p>not illegal because they took place under the eyes of the Attorney
</p>
<p>General and Solicitor General of England. The first of these meet-
</p>
<p>ings to which I shall call your attention, is that which Mr. Ross, one
</p>
<p>of the Crown witnesses, proved that he was present at ; that was the
</p>
<p>meeting of 200,000 persons which was held in London. They met,
</p>
<p>together to discuss the grievance of the sentence passed on the Dor-
</p>
<p>chester labourers. 200,000 men marched to Downing-street to visit
</p>
<p>Lord Melbourne, who was then Prime Minister, with a petition
</p>
<p>which it took twenty men to lift, containing their opinions on the
</p>
<p>sentence inflicted by one of the Judges of England. They were
</p>
<p>headed by a Clergyman of the Established Church of England, Dr.

<p>Wade, in his robes. Remember, one of Mr. O'Connell's wicked
</p>
<p>actions was, that he went to one of these meetings in his robes of
</p>
<p>office. It is not very likely that a man who was going to encourage
</p>
<p>a riot or a breach of the peace, would go to a meeting in his robes.
</p>
<p>Dr. Wade headed the meeting in his full robes, the Attorney General
</p>
<p>of England looking out at them as they marched through the street.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I will read to you a short account of that meeting, that
</p>
<p>you may see how quietly and in what capital style they do these
</p>
<p>things in England. It is taken from a newspaper of the 27th of
</p>
<p>April, 1834 : " The meeting assembled at six o'clock, in Copen-
</p>
<p>" hagen Fields. At eight o'clock the principal lodges, headed by

</p>
<p>" their respective officers, with crimson collars, marched five or six
</p>
<p>" abreast, in regular, almost military order. The view of such large
</p>
<p>** columns was most imposing. The numbers could not be less than
</p>
<p>" 200,000. The different lodges were distinguished by appropriate
</p>
<p>"banners; and at their head marched Mr. Owen, in a blue cloak
</p>
<p>" and crimson collar, and Dr. Wade in his clerical robes." Now,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, what is the result of these 200,000 marching through
</p>
<p>the streets of London, with flags and banners, uninterrupted by any
</p>
<p>body ?  what is stated by the Prime Minister of the day ?  that
</p>
<p>200,000 men coming to present a petition, is a thing which cannot
</p>
<p>be sanctioned by the Government. " Your meeting isjustifiable ; it
</p>
<p>is for a justifiable object; your petition isjustifiable, your conduct is
</p>
<p>justifiable; but I cannot receive a deputation consisting of 200,000
</p>
<p>men. Send me your petition to-morrow, and I will receive it and
</p>
<p>lay it before the King." Was it suggested that they were guilty of
</p>
<p>a conspiracy, for meeting for those objects with flags and banners, and
</p>
<p>484
</p>
<p>marching tli rough the streets of London. The police of London
</p>
<p>were ordered to leave the ground, and not to interfere, unless they
</p>
<p>observed a tendency to riot or confusion. There was no riot or con-
</p>
<p>fusion at the meeting. It was a lawful meeting, but I admit it was
</p>
<p>objectionable, because so large a body of men marching to the King
</p>
<p>or the Houses of Parliament with a petition, is a proceeding which
</p>
<p>ought not to be sanctioned. The account of the meeting is given
</p>
<p>in the Morning Post of the day. That paper commends the
</p>
<p>conduct of the Government for not interfering ; and speaking with
</p>
<p>regard to the Times, who had censured the meeting, observed
</p>
<p>that they thought such censure came strangely from that journal,
</p>
<p>who, previously to the passing of the Reform Bill, had sanctioned
</p>
<p>and encouraged the use of the brickbat and the bludgeon.
</p>
<p>I shall now call your attention to the meetings which were held at
</p>
<p>Birmingham, previous to the passing of (he Reform Bill. A meeting of
</p>
<p>the Birmingham Political Union took place on the 8th of October, 1831.
</p>
<p>The following is the description of that meeting, given by one of the
</p>
<p>newspapers of the day : " Grand meeting of the Birmingham and
</p>
<p>" other Political Unions of the Midland Districts On Monday, in
</p>
<p>" pursuance of advertisements issued by the Council of the Birming-
</p>
<p>" ham Political Union, a public meeting of the inhabitants of the
</p>
<p>" town and neighbourhood took place off New Hall Hill, for the
</p>
<p>" purpose of demonstrating to the House of Lords, that the public
</p>
<p>" enthusiasm in favour of the Reform Bill is not abated, and in
</p>
<p>4< order to petition the Right Honourable House, to give their final
</p>
<p>" sanction in carrying that great measure into a law without delay.
</p>
<p>" There never was, we may safely assert, any previous occasion upon
</p>
<p>" which such deep and universal excitement pervaded the public
</p>
<p>" mind of Birmingham and its neighbourhood. Notwithstanding the
</p>
<p>" numerous and highly respectable meeting which took place for a
</p>
<p>" similar purpose, under the auspices of the High Bailiff, so late as
</p>
<p>" Friday last, the inhabitants looked up to the meeting of Monday,
</p>
<p>" as the one which would most effectively develope the state of pub-
</p>
<p>" lie feeling : and in this they were not mistaken. The day was

</p>
<p>" ushered in like a day of triumph, by the ringing of the church
</p>
<p>" bells, and by ten o'clock the inhabitants were upon a general move
</p>
<p>" to the place of meeting. The spot fixed upon for the scene of this
</p>
<p>" amazing spectacle was New Hall Hill, a large vacant spot of ground
</p>
<p>" situated in the northern suburbs of the town, and peculiarly well
</p>
<p>" formed for such a purpose. It consists of twelve acres of rising
</p>
<p>" land, in the form of an amphitheatre. In the valley, a number of
</p>
<p>" waggons were ranged in half circle, the centre one being appropri-
</p>
<p>" ated to the chairman, and the various speakers who addressed the
</p>
<p>" meeting. About half-past eleven o'clock the Birmingham Union,
</p>
<p>" headed by Messrs. Attwood, Scholefield, Muntz, Jones, &c, and
</p>
<p>" preceded by the band, began to arrive on the ground, but such
</p>
<p>" were their numbers, that a considerable time elapsed before all
</p>
<p>" had taken their stations on the ground. The scene at this mo-
</p>
<p>" ment was peculiarly animated and picturesque ; at different points
</p>
<p>" of the procession various splendid banners were carried, on
</p>
<p>485
</p>
<p>K which were as various devices and mottoes ; among the latter
</p>
<p>" we noticed, William the Fourth, the People's Hope. Earl Grey.
</p>
<p>" The just Rights of our Order secured, we will then stand by his
</p>
<p>" Order. The device of a dove, with an olive branch, and the rising-
</p>
<p>" Sun, with the motto ; Attwood, Union, Liberty and Peace. Taxa-
</p>
<p>>v Hon, without Representation, is Tyranny. Laivler and Skipivith, and
</p>
<p>" the independent Representatives who voted for Reform. Let it be
</p>
<p>" impressed upon your Minds  let it be instilled into your Children,
</p>
<p>" that the Liberty of the Press is the Palladium of all your civil,
</p>
<p>" political, and religious Rights. Union until England is regenera-
</p>
<p>" ted, Scotland renovated, and Ireland redressed. The best Security
</p>
<p>"for the Throne of Kings is the People's Love. It is utterly impos-
</p>
<p>" sible adequately to describe the appearance of this most magnificent
</p>
<p>" assembly. When the Council had taken their stations on the plat -
</p>
<p>" form, upon the lowest computation, not less than 80,000 were within
</p>
<p>" the range of vision, and in about half an hour afterwards, when the
</p>
<p>" Staffordshire Unions arrived upon the ground, the number present
</p>
<p>" was calculated by some at considerably above 100,000. In our
</p>
<p>" opinion, moderately speaking, the numbers could not possibly fall
</p>
<p>" much short of that number. The spectacle was the most splendid
</p>
<p>" of the kind we ever remember to have witnessed. On the ridge of
</p>
<p>" the hill which crowned the amphitheatre, the banners, in numbers
</p>
<p>" about twenty, were placed at equal distances, and gave a beautiful
</p>
<p>" finish to the perspective. Among other distinguished persons pre-
</p>
<p>" sent on the occasion, drawn to the spot by motives of curiosity, but
</p>
<p>" who took no part in the proceeding, were Prince Hohenlohe (the
</p>
<p>" brother of the celebrated prophet of that name), and the Chamber-
</p>
<p>" lain to the King of Prussia. They accompanied Mr. Attwood, to
</p>
<p>" whom they had been introduced by Mr. Rothschild, for the purpose
</p>
<p>" of witnessing the progress and perfection of Birmingham manufac-
</p>
<p>' ture ; they had likewise had the good fortune of witnessing an un-
</p>
<p>" paralleled exhibition of Birmingham public spirit." It is not ne-
</p>
<p>cessary for me to read the speeches, but the speakers used very warm
</p>
<p>language. They plainly said they will have their rights ; that the

<p>Reform Bill shall be passed ; that the then representation in Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment was a mockery, a libel on the Constitution, an insult to them ;
</p>
<p>that the wealthy inhabitants of Manchester should not be represented,
</p>
<p>though a miserable town close by had two representatives. They say
</p>
<p>that might be law, but that it was not constitutional  that it was against
</p>
<p>the spirit of the Constitution, and all law must be redressed. They
</p>
<p>went further ; they intimated their intention to pass a resolution not
</p>
<p>to pay taxes, and to send up a small party of 100,000 men to London
</p>
<p>to quicken the deliberations of the House of Lords. Did the Minis,
</p>
<p>ters of the day presume to say that the meeting was illegal ? No
</p>
<p>Attorney-General, who ever stood on English ground, would have
</p>
<p>dared to say so. I do not say this insolently or presumptuously.
</p>
<p>Those men knew their rights, whether their opinions were right or
</p>
<p>wrong, it is not for me to say, but they expressed those opinions,
</p>
<p>and combined to cany them into execution ; they became powerful,
</p>
<p>and plainly stated that since Reform was resisted by the oligarchy for
</p>
<p>486
</p>
<p>unjust purposes, they would compel them to grant hy the display of
</p>
<p>a great moral confederation, or by what the Solicitor- General will
</p>
<p>call a demonstration of physical force, which is, after all, but a deci-
</p>
<p>sive expression of opinion. They had many of the rich merchants
</p>
<p>and wealthy traders with them, and a great portion of the physical
</p>
<p>force of the country at their back ; they said that the law ought to
</p>
<p>pass, that the resistance to it was corrupt, that it was resisted only
</p>
<p>because men wished for their own profit to prevent it from becoming
</p>
<p>the law of the land  that they should not prevent it. That it is
</p>
<p>now the law of the land is perhaps as much owing to that meeting
</p>
<p>as to any other cause. I remember to have read that Lord John Rus-
</p>
<p>sell said, that he saw no reason why the people should not speak
</p>
<p>out, that the whisper of a faction would never put down the voice of
</p>
<p>the nation. There was no prosecution resorted to on that occasion,
</p>
<p>none of that mawkish sentimental twaddle about men coming toge-
</p>
<p>ther to express their honest, firm, and deliberate conviction that such
</p>
<p>a law should be the law of England. They sought to redress their
</p>
<p>wrongs, and to secure their freedom, and therefore it was that they
</p>
<p>met arid passed this resolution. There were other resolutions which
</p>
<p>I shall not read to you, but which were of a very strong character.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I shall now bring the Attorney-General to the county
</p>
<p>with which he is connected, his own happy Yorkshire. In that
</p>
<p>county he represents a borough, and I am sure a better, or more
</p>
<p>honourable representative cannot be found. I will bring him back
</p>
<p>to Yorkshire, and tell him when next he goes there, to inquire about
</p>
<p>King Richard, that is, Mr. Oastler, and to see his placards. I need
</p>
<p>not tell you that there was very great discontent in the north of
</p>
<p>England on two subjects, the Poor-Law Bill, and the Factory Bill.
</p>
<p>The mass of the people considered that those employed in the fac-
</p>
<p>tories, both young and old, were in fact nothing better than slaves 
</p>
<p>slaves under the beneficent rule of England, more wretched, as they
</p>
<p>describe it, than the black slaves ; that their children were forced to
</p>
<p>work before they were able to do so. Speeches and songs were
</p>
<p>made against what was called this grinding and remorseless despo-

<p>tism. I quote from the York Herald and General Advertiser, of
</p>
<p>the 28th of April, 1832 : " Great Yorkshire meeting in support of
</p>
<p>" the Ten Hours Factory Bill.  This great meeting, in support of jus-
</p>
<p>" lice and humanity, was held in the Castle-yard on Tuesday last.
</p>
<p>" Though much of the interest of its appearance was certainly taken
</p>
<p>" away by the very unfavourable state of the weather, yet we are
</p>
<p>" happy to say that this untoward event in no wise damped the spirit
</p>
<p>" of the proceedings. Early on Monday morning the bustle began
</p>
<p>" in Leeds ; the streets were crowded with people, waiting to wit-
</p>
<p>" ness the arrival of the different divisions ; the bells of the parish
</p>
<p>" churches rung merry peals, and, as the weather was then favour-
</p>
<p>" ble, the scene was altogether lively and cheering. According to
</p>
<p>" the programme the various divisions of operatives entered Leeds
</p>
<p>" from Halifax, Huddersfield, Bradford, Dewsbury, Heckmondwicke,
</p>
<p>" Holmfirth, Keighlev, &c, with their flags and music. They re-
</p>
<p>" paired to the While Cloth Hall Yard, where refreshment was
</p>
<p>487
</p>
<p>" served to those who, from want of employment, could not afford
</p>
<p>" to supply their own wants. The first Leeds division left that town
</p>
<p>" at eleven o'clock at night, and the second an hour after ; but it is
</p>
<p>" needless for us to dwell upon the minutiae of a dark and dreary
</p>
<p>" march through rain and mire, and it is sufficient to observe that a
</p>
<p>" strong sense of duty, and the consciousness of being engaged in a
</p>
<p>" righteous cause, kept up the spirit, and gave nerve to the exertions
</p>
<p>" of those thousands of pedestrians." Mr. Oastler made a speech ;
</p>
<p>anything more distinct and emphatic was never heard. He described
</p>
<p>the infantine slavery which existed as worse than that of the blacks.
</p>
<p>They resolved on petitioning Parliament, and Lord Ashley was instru-
</p>
<p>mental in gaining theTen Hours Bill, which was not then, but is now the
</p>
<p>law of the land. They met in thousands and tens of thousands ; they
</p>
<p>remonstrated, they combined to carry their object, they assembled with
</p>
<p>banners and music, and some of their language was more violent by
</p>
<p>a thousand degrees than any which has been used in the course of this
</p>
<p>Agitation. They reviled the aristocracy, and declared that the wealth
</p>
<p>which they possessed was procured by the sweat and labour of the
</p>
<p>poor. Did the Attorney-General ever say that this combination for
</p>
<p>a common object, or the means which they took to carry that object
</p>
<p>were illegal ? They had processions, they marched with lighted
</p>
<p>flambeaux, they came in thousands, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty and
</p>
<p>a hundred miles ; for what purpose ? to compel the Legislature to do
</p>
<p>what ? to listen to their grievances, to discuss their grievances, to
</p>
<p>hear their complaints and to redress them, to listen to the call of
</p>
<p>humanity on their behalf, and to do the unfortunate artisans in Eng-
</p>
<p>land that justice which I hope will yet be done to the unfortunate
</p>
<p>labourer in Ireland. Gentlemen, there is an account given, I think
</p>
<p>it is in the history of the Factory Regulation Bill in 1832, of the
</p>
<p>means which were employed to carry that Act. They call these
</p>
<p>gatherings by the name of the Pilgrimage of Mercy. There could
</p>
<p>be nothing more exciting than the language of these publications,
</p>
<p>they held out the manufacturers to be worse than the slave owners,
</p>
<p>they insisted that the law should be altered, and it was altered.

</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I will now call your attention to the Hills-
</p>
<p>borough meeting which was mentioned by Mr. Sheil ; it is described
</p>
<p>in the Evening Mail of the 31st of October, 1834. The men of
</p>
<p>the north are there described as having done their duty well, and I
</p>
<p>am happy to hear it, I admire and like them for it. They marched
</p>
<p>to Hillsborough "in border fashion," to do what? to meet, and by a
</p>
<p>demonstration of physical force to express, what? that the Union
</p>
<p>should be maintained, and that they would support it and resist its
</p>
<p>repeal at the sacrifice of their lives and fortunes. They had a right
</p>
<p>to come there with 75,000, marching " in border fashion," to hear
</p>
<p>bold speeches and strong arguments in support of the Union, and do
</p>
<p>you think that if they met to-morrow again to express their determi-
</p>
<p>nation to maintain the Union, and to declare their confidence in the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General, that they would not be
</p>
<p>greatly obliged to them for doing so ? Do you think that if they
</p>
<p>passed a vote of thanks for the spirit, zeal, and ability, and, I will add,
</p>
<p>488
</p>
<p>moderation, with which this prosecution has been conducted, that
</p>
<p>the Attorney- General would not return them thanks in his most
</p>
<p>flowing and graceful style. Would he not say, * Gentlemen, I am
</p>
<p>deeply grateful, and believe me, to the last moment of my life I shall
</p>
<p>be sensible of this expression of confidence and approbation of my con-
</p>
<p>duct and of that of the Government, of which lam an unworthy mem-
</p>
<p>ber, and of your determination by a great demonstration of physical
</p>
<p>force, to sustain the Law, the Church, the State, and all the Estab-
</p>
<p>lished Institutions of the country." Yes, Gentlemen of the Jury,
</p>
<p>75,000 men met at Hillsborough for a common object and a common
</p>
<p>purpose. There were no women or children amongst them, and I
</p>
<p>will venture to say that there was hardly a man there who could not
</p>
<p>handle a gun, or polish a musket ; and I believe the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>in his heart rejoices that they could. Suppose that these 75,000 men
</p>
<p>had come to a resolution, such as the following: " Resolved  We
</p>
<p>are of opinion, that the Union is unconstitutional, illegal, and a
</p>
<p>grievance, and should be repealed." I want to know whether they
</p>
<p>had not a right to meet and express that opinion  whether they had
</p>
<p>not a right to bring banners and flags, and bands of music, and to play
</p>
<p>those tunes with which my friend, Mr. Napier, is so familiar, for full
</p>
<p>many a time and oft he has defended most respectable clients, charged
</p>
<p>with slight excesses which they may have committed on their return
</p>
<p>from those pleasant parties where they commemorated him, who, as
</p>
<p>Lord Plunkett expressed it, "came to conquer Ireland to happiness and
</p>
<p>freedom ?" Suppose that they met, " in border fashion," and declared
</p>
<p>in bold language that they would give their confidence to the Minister
</p>
<p>of the Crown  that they would back him with their lives and fortunes
</p>
<p>if he upheld the agitation ; and, Gentlemen, I certainly think they
</p>
<p>were formidable. But what would be said, instead of five, ten, or
</p>
<p>fifteen thousand men, women and children, 75,000 Protestant Yeo-
</p>
<p>men, with arms in their possession, met to support the Government
</p>
<p>with their lives and fortunes? Have they aright to support the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution ? Have they a right to resist the Repeal of the Union ?
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General, by this prosecution, says, that they have not.

</p>
<p>I say they had. I say there is no law for one class of men more than
</p>
<p>for another. There is no law to enable 75,000 men to meet and
</p>
<p>petition, in support of an Act of Parliament at Hillsborough, and at
</p>
<p>the same time, to prohibit 75,000 to meet, in order to petition the
</p>
<p>repeal of the same Act at Tara Hill ? But when twelve gentlemen
</p>
<p>are considering the true character of this prosecution, I have no more
</p>
<p>doubt than that as I am a living man, that no consideration of a paltry
</p>
<p>political nature will draw their minds to the conclusion that meetings
</p>
<p>are illegal, which are held in the exercise of petitioning the Sovereign
</p>
<p>or the Legislature, a right as undoubted as that of our gracious Sovereign
</p>
<p>to the throne of these realms. I know that you will never act on a
</p>
<p>partial, intolerant principle. You will never say that the men of the
</p>
<p>North have a right to meet and discuss, in order to petition Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment ; but that the men of the South have no such right. You
</p>
<p>will say that the law of England is an impartial law, and knows
</p>
<p>no distinction between one man and another, which does not dis-
</p>
<p>489
</p>
<p>criminate between different religious or political creeds, but extends
</p>
<p>its protecting shield alike over all. You are too sensible of the bene-
</p>
<p>fits of the constitution of which you are this day the guardians,
</p>
<p>to say that men have not a right to meet to petition, provided that
</p>
<p>they meet bona fide for that purpose, and provided it is not a mask to
</p>
<p>conceal a plot, or a combination to destroy the institutions of the
</p>
<p>country, to spread ruin and devastation through the land, and pro-
</p>
<p>vided that meeting does not violate the letter of the law or the spirit
</p>
<p>of the Constitution.
</p>
<p>And now, Gentlemen, I will consider the general character of the
</p>
<p>meetings, as collected from the evidence which has been brought
</p>
<p>forward in the case. I will consider the evidence en masse, and will
</p>
<p>not go through the different meetings seriatim. Analyse with ac-
</p>
<p>curacy that evidence, and compare it with the testimony which
</p>
<p>might have been given. Rank and file, we had the whole police es-
</p>
<p>tablishment in Ireland produced on the table ; 1 mean to say, that
</p>
<p>there is no rank, office, or degree in the constabulary department,
</p>
<p>a representative of which has not been brought before you in the
</p>
<p>character of a witness. We have had Police Sergeants and Police
</p>
<p>Constables, Chief Constables and Inspectors of Police, Stipendiary
</p>
<p>Magistrates and aspirant Inspectors. We, on the part of the tra-
</p>
<p>versers, have adopted every expedient which human ingenuity
</p>
<p>could suggest in order to obtain undeniable and authentic evi-
</p>
<p>dence of the true character of these meetings. During the few
</p>
<p>weeks' respite which your Lordships were kind enough to allow us,
</p>
<p>we have had agents in every part of Ireland to discover whether
</p>
<p>any act of violence had been done, to make inquiry whether the
</p>
<p>meetings occasioned alarm or terror, whether any person was as-
</p>
<p>saulted or any property was injured, whether the resident gentry, or
</p>
<p>men of business, or men of political opinions different from those of
</p>
<p>the traversers, felt alarm or terror at these assemblages of the people,
</p>
<p>and what is the result of all the mass of evidence given before you
</p>
<p>even by the Crown ? That there was no infraction of the law, no
</p>
<p>violation of the peace, not even a tendency to a breach of the peace,

<p>no infraction of good order or decorum, no exhibition of arms. The
</p>
<p>police officers might have been asked not only whether they felt
</p>
<p>alarm themselves, but whether any person in the community had
</p>
<p>complained to any one of them that he felt alarm ; no such question
</p>
<p>was put on behalf of the Crown. The result, therefore, of the whole
</p>
<p>evidence is, that perfect peace and unbroken tranquillity prevailed
</p>
<p>at these meetings. If the meetings were held, as the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General declares, for the purpose of instilling awe into the public
</p>
<p>mind, why did not the Attorney-General bring witnesses from
</p>
<p>Mallow, from Baltinglass, or from any other of the districts where
</p>
<p>they were held, to prove that they were alarmed at them. Not a
</p>
<p>living being was produced to prove that fact. The police were at
</p>
<p>every meeting, sometimes in their uniforms, but more frequentl3 r
</p>
<p>disguised in plain clothes. They were dispersed through every
</p>
<p>meeting  they were in the nature of spies for the Crown. I do not
</p>
<p>mean to use the word in an offensive sense, but their duty was to
</p>
<p>watch and make inquiries, and report all they heard and saw. What
</p>
<p>3R
</p>
<p>490
</p>
<p>was the result of their evidence ? What was the sum and substance
</p>
<p>of their testimony, combining and concentrating their evidence from
</p>
<p>first to last ? This  that whether they were disguised or not dis-
</p>
<p>guised, they were never subjected to unworthy treatment at the hands
</p>
<p>of the people; that no injury was ever inflicted on them; that the
</p>
<p>people conducted themselves invariably with peacefulness, good or-
</p>
<p>der, and tranquillity ; although when large multitudes are assembled
</p>
<p>together, if one man commits a violent act all present may be involved
</p>
<p>in the consequence of that, yet on no occasion was there an instance
</p>
<p>of impropriety even on the part of a single individual. If the contra-
</p>
<p>ry was susceptible of proof, why was it not proved? No witness
</p>
<p>proved that there was any display of weapons of any description. The
</p>
<p>people went empty handed to the meetings, or else they were armed
</p>
<p>with nothing more than a white wand, somewhat similar in length
</p>
<p>and thickness to the switch wherewith my learned friend and myself,
</p>
<p>in former years, were corrected for our boyish misdeeds ; and even
</p>
<p>they were used only for the purpose of preserving order, and prevent-
</p>
<p>ing confusion and obstruction on the roads  such is the evidence of
</p>
<p>our crime, such is " The head and front of our offending." The mon-
</p>
<p>strous proposition for which the Attorney-General is contending is,
</p>
<p>that the more peaceable, the more orderly, the more decorous the
</p>
<p>meetings were, the more deserving they are of reprehension. How
</p>
<p>am I to defend those men, if that doctrine be admitted, that the more
</p>
<p>peaceable their demeanour the greater is the proof that a conspiracy
</p>
<p>existed; and if that peaceable demeanour is only evidence of the atro-
</p>
<p>city of our fell intent ? According to this doctrine, it naturally fol-
</p>
<p>lows, that if you, Gentlemen, had been put into the jury box for the
</p>
<p>purpose of deciding on the sanity or insanity of a man, every proof
</p>
<p>that his words and actions have been in the strictest conformity with
</p>
<p>the dictates of unclouded reason, must be regarded as damning and
</p>
<p>conclusive evidence of his insanity. In conformity with that doctrine,
</p>
<p>the Attorney- General calls upon you to say, that the legality of our pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings is to be regarded as proof of our intention to carry a legal ob-
</p>
<p>ject by illegal means. If the persons assembled at these meetings had

</p>
<p>demeaned themselves like violent, besotted men, healing and knocking
</p>
<p>down all they met, that, according to the Attorney-General, would
</p>
<p>have been quite natural and consistent with the true Irish character ;
</p>
<p>the law would have been broken in the manner in which it ought to
</p>
<p>be broken, and as it has been broken in Ireland from time immemorial.
</p>
<p>But if men lay aside the national vice which has gained them a reputa-
</p>
<p>tion throughout Europe  if they meet silently and peacefully  if they
</p>
<p>demean themselves with courtesy towards every person, and with the
</p>
<p>strictest order, the Attorney-General calls for Hawkins and Hale to
</p>
<p>prove that they have been guilty of treason, conspiracy, and every-
</p>
<p>thing that is horrible. But the Attorney-General says that the reso-
</p>
<p>lution to petition Parliament was only a pretext to give a legal com-
</p>
<p>plexion to these meetings, and, indeed, I understood him to say that
</p>
<p>he would adduce evidence to prove that no petitions were presented
</p>
<p>to the House of Commons, He has brought forward no evidence to
</p>
<p>prove this statement, nor was it material that he should do so. That
</p>
<p>question arose in Hardy's case, and it was clearly shown by Mr. Ers-
</p>
<p>491
</p>
<p>kine, that a meeting was not to be deemed criminal or illegal because
</p>
<p>a petition was not presented with panting expedition. The true ob-
</p>
<p>ject was to have a great number of petitions prepared, in order that
</p>
<p>they might have more weight and influence when Mr. O'Connell came
</p>
<p>to present them in mass  that was the plan adopted by the Chartists
</p>
<p>in England. They did not present a petition until they had obtained
</p>
<p>three millions of signatures. Was it said that this was illegal ? What
</p>
<p>does Baron Kolfe say with regard to the Chartist meetings ? " What
</p>
<p>" numbers can make a meeting illegal ; what quantum of organiza-
</p>
<p>u tion and arrangement ; what deputations from one to another ;
</p>
<p>" what quantum of all or any of these makes a meeting illegal, is a
</p>
<p>** question which must depend wholly on degree. It is very difficult
</p>
<p>" to lay down any ru\eapriori, and, therefore, I will not encumber the
</p>
<p>** present sufficiently encumbered case, by stating what my view of the
</p>
<p>" law is on that point." This case, therefore, so far as the numbers are
</p>
<p>concerned, ends in nothing. They had a right to petition. They
</p>
<p>came in numbers, but there is no law to say that it is illegal for a
</p>
<p>number of persons to seek, by petitioning, a legal object  the repeal
</p>
<p>of that Statute, called the Act of Union. It would have been absurd
</p>
<p>to have presented a single petition, when, as the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>admits, no more than thirty members of the House of Commons were
</p>
<p>favourable to the Repeal of the Union ; it was, therefore, necessary
</p>
<p>and proper to wait until a sufficient number had been procured, so
</p>
<p>as to present them in mass, and to make the desired impression
</p>
<p>on the Parliament.
</p>
<p>I shall now call your attention to two or three circumstances,
</p>
<p>in relation to these meetings. The first peculiarity connected with
</p>
<p>them is the attendance of the Temperance bands. The Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General must have a very inharmonious turn of mind if he ob-
</p>
<p>jects to the Irish people seeking so innocent an amusement, instead
</p>
<p>of the poison by which they formerly inflamed their minds, and
</p>
<p>perverted their understandings. I say that it is commendable in
</p>
<p>them to do so, although I cannot say that those Temperance bands
</p>
<p>are very harmonious. But did these bands play party tunes ? not

</p>
<p>like the bands in the North of Ireland. The good and loyal music
</p>
<p>which they play is: "The Protestant boys will carry the day;''
</p>
<p>" The Boyne Water;" " Down, down, Croppies lie down." These
</p>
<p>are the only loyal tunes in the North ; they despise all other music ;
</p>
<p>and many a broken head and black eye was the result of not joining
</p>
<p>with the loyal bands who play these loyal tunes. They never play
</p>
<p>" God save the Queen" there at all, and because the Temperance
</p>
<p>bands play it, the Attorney-General says it is rank treason. One of
</p>
<p>the witnesses stated that these bands had colours, and wore fancy
</p>
<p>uniforms, and played " God save the Queen." How excessively an-
</p>
<p>noying to loyal ears ! Why, Gentlemen, I never heard such music
</p>
<p>as the Temperance bands play. But because men dress themselves
</p>
<p>in fancy dresses, and amuse themselves with music instead of going to
</p>
<p>a public house, depriving themselves of reason, and unfitting them-
</p>
<p>selves for the discharge of their duties, the Attorney-General says
</p>
<p>they are guilty of a conspiracy. Well, I think the charge was not
</p>
<p>far wide of the mark, for I never heard of a fouler or a darker con-
</p>
<p>492
</p>
<p>spiracy to murder harmony. O yes ! these Temperance bands did
</p>
<p>conspire, confederate, combine, and agree to murder harmony.
</p>
<p>Well, but they had flags and mottoes, not perhaps such as the At-
</p>
<p>torney-General would have selected ; these would have been Church
</p>
<p>and State; The Constitution, as settled in 1688, and others, to
</p>
<p>which, no doubt, my learned friend is sincerely and devotedly at-
</p>
<p>tached. Those are the only loyal mottoes in the mind of the learned
</p>
<p>Attorney-General. But these banners did not bear the motto of
</p>
<p>Church and State, for the first of them was Liberty, and Old Ire-
</p>
<p>land for ever ; another via?, Repeal of the Union; and another, We
</p>
<p>tvitl not be Slaves. There is treason for you ! The people say,
</p>
<p>" we will trust in O'Connell, who tells us to come quietly to a meet-
</p>
<p>ing, and to go home peaceably." That, is conspiracy! They take
</p>
<p>his advice. Worse and worse ! ! Oh, say the Crown prosecutors,
</p>
<p>these fellows will not get drunk and break each others' heads ; they
</p>
<p>will not go to jail ; they will persevere in dogged peace and tran-
</p>
<p>quillity. Wicked obstinate fellows ! We shall all be ruined ; Sir
</p>
<p>Thomas Staples will not have a single case in the North, next cir-
</p>
<p>cuit. From North to South, from East to West, not a man will go
</p>
<p>to jail. It must be treason ; rank and foul conspiracy. No wonder
</p>
<p>the Crown prosecutors became alarmed when they saw matters going
</p>
<p>on so quietly, and so unfavourably to them, so they resolved that
</p>
<p>Temperance must be put down, and then the Irish will drink, and
</p>
<p>ficht, and recover their senses in jail; and so the Crown lawyers
</p>
<p>combined, conspired, confederated, and agreed to make it out con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. Talking about mottoes, reminds me of a speech of the
</p>
<p>Duke of Sussex, which I met with by accident; I will go up to roy-
</p>
<p>alty itself. The Duke of Sussex made a speech at the Fox Club
</p>
<p>dinner, at Norwich, sometime after the Manchester massacre, in
</p>
<p>1820. The King's health was given, and it was drunk in silence;
</p>
<p>mind that  in silence. The King was the brother of the Duke of
</p>
<p>Sussex, and yet his health was given in silence. That is not the way
</p>
<p>we do in Ireland. When we hear the Queen or Prince Albert's
</p>
<p>name o-iven, we give three cheers, and fling our hats up into the air,

</p>
<p>and shout with joy ; that is the way we do things here. Those who
</p>
<p>say that the Irish do not love the aristocracy and the Constitution
</p>
<p>are much mistaken. I think they are less disposed to republicanism
</p>
<p>than any other nation. In speaking to a toast at the dinner to which
</p>
<p>I have alluded, the Duke of Sussex used these words: " I would
</p>
<p>rather suffer death than lose my liberty." That was the language of
</p>
<p>one who might have sat on the Throne of England, but the moment
</p>
<p>a poor Irishman puts  not the words, Down with the Monarchy, or
</p>
<p>Down with the Bench, or Down with the Peerage, or Down with
</p>
<p>the Attorney- General, or Down with the Oligarchy, or Down with
</p>
<p>the Privileged Orders, or Down with the Borough System, but
</p>
<p>Liberty, on a banner, the law officers of the Crown start up and
</p>
<p>say it is conspiracy. There was also this motto, Liberty or Death,
</p>
<p>at that dinner. That motto was questioned by some. The matter
</p>
<p>was laid before the Attorney-General of England, and he declared
</p>
<p>that the object of the dinner being a legal one, the proceedings at it
</p>
<p>493
</p>
<p>were perfectly constitutional. Let us now turn to some of the ban-
</p>
<p>ners and mottoes at one of these meetings. It was proved that there
</p>
<p>was an arch erected at Tullamore with the inscription, Ireland, her
</p>
<p>Parliament, or the World in a Blaze, but that was not put up by
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, or Mr. Steele, or any of the traversers, or with their
</p>
<p>knowledge. M'Namara told you distinctly, that persons came to
</p>
<p>that meeting precisely as they would have gone to a fair or to a mar-
</p>
<p>ket. Afterwards, one of the policemen endeavoured to pervert the
</p>
<p>facts, and to make out that there was a procession, but he was obliged
</p>
<p>to admit that the people were quiet. The motto inscribed on the
</p>
<p>arch was undoubtedly improper and unjustifiable, but, as I have al-
</p>
<p>ready said it was placed there without the knowledge or consent of
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, and the moment he saw it he sent Mr. Steele, who,
</p>
<p>being one of the traversers, cannot be examined, to pull it down, and
</p>
<p>it will be proved to you that it was taken down before the meeting".
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, make the case your own ; suppose you were going to a
</p>
<p>public meeting, and suppose that without your knowledge or appro-
</p>
<p>bation some rash and misguided person erected an arch over the road
</p>
<p>through which you were to pass, are you to be made accountable for
</p>
<p>it, merely because it was erected there, although you did not desire
</p>
<p>it to be put up. It will be proved to you distinctly, that the moment
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell's eye caught the inscription, he said that he would not
</p>
<p>go to the meeting until it was removed, that he sent Mr. Steele who
</p>
<p>had it removed, before the meeting was held. I rely strongly on
</p>
<p>that fact, as proving that the intention of the traversers was not cri-
</p>
<p>minal or illegal, that they meant to confine themselves within the
</p>
<p>boundaries of the constitution, and not to outstep the limits of the
</p>
<p>law. The policeman stated that when he passed, an hour or two
</p>
<p>afterwards, the banner had been removed. I therefore rely on this
</p>
<p>fact as evidence in favour of the accused, and not against them.
</p>
<p>I shall now draw your attention to another circumstance which
</p>
<p>occurred at Mullaghmast. The counsel for the Crown stated, that
</p>
<p>they intended to rely on the acts done, and the speeches made at
</p>
<p>the several meetings. Now, persons of ordinary understanding

</p>
<p>would suppose, that it was meant to give evidence of speeches and
</p>
<p>acts which would lead to a clear conclusion that the persons who
</p>
<p>spoke and acted were guilty of a conspiracy to carry an illegal object.
</p>
<p>But I can conceive nothing more absurd than to give the acts of one
</p>
<p>man in evidence, in order to prove that another man is guilty of a
</p>
<p>conspiracy, and to convert a lawful meeting, for a lawful object, into
</p>
<p>an unlawful meeting, and for an unlawful object. We do not object
</p>
<p>to the inscriptions and banners which appeared there being given in
</p>
<p>evidence against those who attended that meeting ; but we do object,
</p>
<p>in accordance with Mr. Justice Bayley's opinion, that they should be
</p>
<p>given in evidence unless they were within the view of the speaker 
</p>
<p>and if inscriptions which the parties never saw, and acts which they
</p>
<p>never knew T or approved of, are allowed to be given in evidence I
</p>
<p>say? there is an end to the possibility of any body of men meeting
</p>
<p>for the purpose of discussing any subject, however legal it may be.
</p>
<p>Try this meeting by the test of the meeting at Hillsborough. That
</p>
<p>494
</p>
<p>meeting was held for the purpose of supporting and not of repealing
</p>
<p>the Union. There were 75,000 people present. They made speeches,
</p>
<p>and they carried banners and flags. Did a question arise as to the
</p>
<p>legality of that meeting. What is to be the test of the legality of a
</p>
<p>meeting? I should say, and you would say, that its legality is to be
</p>
<p>determined by the acts done, by the speakers, by the speeches
</p>
<p>made, by the inscriptions on the banners and the flags used at
</p>
<p>the meeting, by the general conduct of the persons assembled,
</p>
<p>whether they met quietly and returned home peaceably ; all these
</p>
<p>circumstances are to be looked at with the eye of a Christian.
</p>
<p>They are to be considered as men would consider them, who
</p>
<p>respect the privileges of the Constitution. They are not to be
</p>
<p>scanned with the captious eyes of a lawyer. You are not to find men
</p>
<p>guilty of motives which they never entertained. The traversers met
</p>
<p>for the ostensible purpose of petitioning for a Repeal of the Union.
</p>
<p>It lies on the Crown to prove, by indisputable evidence, that this
</p>
<p>motive was but a mask for treason and sedition. But you are not to
</p>
<p>find men guilty of the acts of others, over whom they had no control.
</p>
<p>Lord Downshire and Lord ltoden attended the Hillsborough meet-
</p>
<p>ing, with their tenantry at their backs. Suppose some ballad-singer
</p>
<p>from Belfast had sold at the meeting some scandalous, wicked, dis-
</p>
<p>gusting production, are Lord Roden and Lord Downshire to be
</p>
<p>tried, although they went there for a legal purpose, and did no illegal
</p>
<p>act, because they spoke from the hustings? Are they to be prose-
</p>
<p>cuted, because some bad-minded, illiterate fellow  a spy perhaps 
</p>
<p>sells that production at the meeting ? No. And is Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>to be prosecuted because some obscure individual, for his own private
</p>
<p>gain, rakes up some forgotten fact of history, and displays it to the
</p>
<p>eager eyes of the curious people ? Where is the evidence that
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell ever sanctioned the vending of that placard at Mul-
</p>
<p>laghmast? Where is the evidence that he ever saw it? They pro-
</p>
<p>duced Browne, the printer of the Association ; and he brought all
</p>
<p>the documents which he ever printed for them, or which were ever
</p>
<p>ordered by them. Is that document among them ? And are these

</p>
<p>men to be tried, condemned, and sentenced, because a ballad was sold
</p>
<p>at Mullaghmast containing the history of an event which occurred
</p>
<p>nobody knows when ? Is that evidence of the plot charged in the in-
</p>
<p>dictment ? Is that a proof of the unity of purpose, of a preconcerted
</p>
<p>plan for the illegal object with which the traversers are charged ?
</p>
<p>The printer of the Association is produced ; other documents are
</p>
<p>proved as having been ordered and paid for by the Association ; and
</p>
<p>not a particle of evidence is given as to this document, though
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General calls on you to fasten on these unfortunate
</p>
<p>gentlemen  for unfortunate they are, if they are to be convicted on
</p>
<p>such evidence as this  the guilt of some anonymous miscreant.
</p>
<p>Every principle of law, justice, and reason, makes it imperative
</p>
<p>on the Attorney-General, in a prosecution for a political crime,
</p>
<p>to keep back nothing. I complain that he has produced no wit-
</p>
<p>ness as to the printing of this ballad. It was not our duty or
</p>
<p>our business to do so. They have ascribed guilt to us, and
</p>
<p>49f>
</p>
<p>they are bound to prove it. They have not proved it, and, Gentle-
</p>
<p>men of the Jury, although that ballad has been admitted by the
</p>
<p>Court, I submit, that it cannot be evidence against us, unless it is
</p>
<p>proved to have been printed in pursuance of the common plan, union,
</p>
<p>and combination, for the unlawful object with which the traversers
</p>
<p>are charged.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I shall now draw your attention to what was said at
</p>
<p>some of these meetings, and as you have heard Mr. Fitzgibbon
</p>
<p>allude to some of the best passages in Mr. O'Connell's speech, I
</p>
<p>will take up a few of what may be considered the worst. First, I
</p>
<p>will observe that many of the speeches which were given in evidence
</p>
<p>were not proved to have been actually spoken by Mr. O'Connell.
</p>
<p>The nature of the accusation enables the Crown to give a number of
</p>
<p>newspapers in evidence, containing reports of speeches alleged, but
</p>
<p>not proved to have been made by Mr. O'Connell. You will recol-
</p>
<p>lect, that it is impossible to discriminate between the speeches as
</p>
<p>they were actually spoken, and the speeches as they were afterwards
</p>
<p>embellished. Some of the most eloquent passages, particularly in
</p>
<p>the way of political extracts, have been attributed to men, although
</p>
<p>they never spoke them. It is said, that a great portion of Cicero's
</p>
<p>speech, in defence of Milo, was never spoken by that eloquent ad-
</p>
<p>vocate. I will draw your attention to one or two of the speeches
</p>
<p>attributed to Mr. O'Connell, in which he alluded to the Battle of the
</p>
<p>Boyne, and the defeat of the Irish there. Now, Gentlemen, it is
</p>
<p>singular that Sir Walter Scott, in alluding to the Battle of Flodden-
</p>
<p>field, admonishes his countrymen not to fall into the mistake com-
</p>
<p>mitted by their ancestors, but to be steady, and firm, in their moral
</p>
<p>agitation, and not divided and wavering, as their ancestors were in
</p>
<p>their physical conflicts. That was precisely the meaning of Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell, in alluding to the Battle of the Boyne, He encouraged
</p>
<p>the people to persevere in the moral and constitutional struggle in
</p>
<p>which they were engaged, by a reference to his moral facts. His
</p>
<p>language means no more than this : " By their want of union, and
</p>
<p>" perseverance, your ancestors lost the Battle of the Boyne, do you

</p>
<p>" persevere in the moral and constitutional struggle in which you are
</p>
<p>'' engaged, and you must succeed." But, Gentlemen, is it right that
</p>
<p>my client should be responsible for the speeches of Mr. O'Connell ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Duffy was not at any of the monster meetings. Mr. Duffy was
</p>
<p>in Dublin whilst those meetings were held. Mr. O'Connell spoke
</p>
<p>at Clifden, at Mullaghmast, at Cork, in remote parts of Ireland 
</p>
<p>he used certain illustrations. Could Mr. Duffy control him ? Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connellalluded to certain historical events  to the battle of the Boyne,
</p>
<p>battle of Aughrim ; he quoted poetry and prose, everything which his
</p>
<p>excited fancy could suggest. Did Mr. Duffy combine, confederate
</p>
<p>conspire, and agree, that he should do so ? Mr. Moore has written
</p>
<p>some verses, in which he alludes to the battle of Aughrim in terms of
</p>
<p>sorrow and regret. Yet that did not disentitle him from receiving a
</p>
<p>pension from the Government of which the Solicitor- General is a
</p>
<p>member. Mr. Duffy, in common with other journalists, merely
</p>
<p>printed the reports of the speeches in which Mr. O'Connell referred
</p>
<p>496
</p>
<p>to these historical facts ; and ten months after he is selected and
</p>
<p>brought to trial by the Attorney-General, who prefers to strike a blow
</p>
<p>at him rather than at his professional rivals of the Mail and Packet. The
</p>
<p>expression, " better die like freemen than live like slaves," is a mere
</p>
<p>boastful expression, showing independence of thought and boldnessof
</p>
<p>speech, but proving nothing as to the charge. Another expression
</p>
<p>of Mr. O'Connell was much dwelt on by the Attorney-General : " the
</p>
<p>" people would be stultifying themselves to expect redress from an
</p>
<p>" English Parliament." In his observations on that expression, the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General followed the example of Mr. Mitford, afterwards
</p>
<p>Lord Redesdale, in HorneTooke's case. That eminent lawyer endea-
</p>
<p>voured, from a similar expression, to lead the jury to infer that it was
</p>
<p>the intention of Home Tooke to accomplish his purpose by physical
</p>
<p>force ; but the jury declined on that occasion to adopt the view
</p>
<p>of the learned law officer. Mr. O'Connell, in discussing the subject
</p>
<p>of the Repeal of the Union, frequently made use of the expression,
</p>
<p>" that justice was not to be obtained from the Imperial Parliament."
</p>
<p>It was because he believed that to be the fact that he was of opinion
</p>
<p>that the Union should be repealed. If he had said that the Union
</p>
<p>should be repealed, and yet admitted that justice could be obtained
</p>
<p>from the Imperial Parliament, you must at once see the inconsistency
</p>
<p>which he would have been guilty of. He wished to contrast the ready
</p>
<p>and efficient justice which would be, dispensed by a domestic Legisla-
</p>
<p>ture, with the cold neglect which the applications and complaints of
</p>
<p>the Irish people met with from the Imperial Parliament. He did
</p>
<p>not speak against the power of the House of Commons, nor that it
</p>
<p>should be lopped off as a useless branch of the Legislature. He merely
</p>
<p>said that it was not as pure as it ought to be; that the system of re-
</p>
<p>presentation was imperfect ; and that an Irish Parliament would give
</p>
<p>a more perfect representation, and would restore the country to the
</p>
<p>condition in which it once was.
</p>
<p>I will now call your attention to one meeting, at which, I will
</p>
<p>admit, that a very reprehensible speech was delivered by Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell  I mean the meeting at Longford on the 28th of May. Mr.

<p>O'Connell, on that occasion, spoke freely of Lord Beaumont ; but
</p>
<p>does that prove that the traversers combined, conspired, confede-
</p>
<p>rated, and agreed for the objects specified in the indictment? They
</p>
<p>agreed together, in order to carry the Repeal of the Union. But
</p>
<p>did they agree that Mr. O'Connell should abuse Lord Beaumont,
</p>
<p>or that Lord Beaumont should abuse Mr. O'Connell? I read
</p>
<p>Lord Beaumont's speech against Mr. O'Connell, in which the no-
</p>
<p>ble Lord stated, that he despised him and his vituperation  that he
</p>
<p>despised him as the reptile which crawls in the dust. That is the
</p>
<p>language, and whatever Mr. O'Connell's faults may be, it was he
</p>
<p>who placed Lord Beaumont in the House of Lords, and gave him
</p>
<p>the opportunity of using this gross and insulting language. Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell, insulted and incensed  being himself a master of invec-
</p>
<p>tive  poured forth a torrent of abuse in reply, and said many things
</p>
<p>which he had better have left unspoken ; but did Mr. Duffy combine
</p>
<p>and confederate that Lord Beaumont was to abuse Mr. O'Connell in
</p>
<p>497
</p>
<p>the House of Lords, and that Mr. O'Connell should retort against
</p>
<p>Lord Beaumont at Longford ? Mr. O'Connell was incensed and in-
</p>
<p>sulted at the contumelious language applied to him. Whatever are
</p>
<p>his faults, that remarkable man has gained a place in the history of his
</p>
<p>country, and a name which resounds throughout Europe. And Lord
</p>
<p>Beaumont certainly showed bad taste, weak judgment, and bad man-
</p>
<p>ners in applying such language to him. He only proved that an Irish
</p>
<p>peasant may be more polite than an English peer. There was another
</p>
<p>expression of Mr. O'Connell's, which the Attorney-General dwelt on
</p>
<p>much. Mr. O'Connell said, " I will take care that you do no wrong,
</p>
<p>but if they attack us, we will do so and so." Gentlemen, these are un-
</p>
<p>doubtedly strong expressions, but there is nothing illegal or unconstitu-
</p>
<p>tional in them, explained as they are by other observations such as,
</p>
<p>" they must discuss the question with us," " they must listen to us,"
</p>
<p>tl they shall not bully us." I therefore submit to your better judg-
</p>
<p>ment, that remarks such as these, isolated observations of a speaker,
</p>
<p>the most of them made in reference to public matters, news which
</p>
<p>had lately arrived from the capital, are not a proof of a criminal con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. The style of a speech depends much on the physical condi-
</p>
<p>tion of the speaker at the moment. Many of those speeches were
</p>
<p>made after dinner, and I will venture to say, that if the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General himself stood up after dinner to speak in defence of " Church
</p>
<p>and State" he would be astonished at the speech he would make.
</p>
<p>No doubt it would be a very able, animated and exciting speech ; it
</p>
<p>might contain a great deal of what he calls inflammatory matter, and
</p>
<p>it would not be a bit the worse speech for that. Much has been said
</p>
<p>about the use of the word " foreigner" by Mr. O'Connell. As to
</p>
<p>that he took it from an English law book. Your Lordships will find
</p>
<p>that in the case of Mahony v.Ashlin, 2 Barn. & Ad. 478, that a bill
</p>
<p>drawn in Ireland on a person in England, is a foreign bill in England.
</p>
<p>Ireland was solemnly ruled to be a foreign country, and the Judges
</p>
<p>determined that they would not take judicial notice of Dublin.
</p>
<p>I really do not know why Mr. O'Connell should be indicted for a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy for speaking the legal truth. Then, with regard to the man-

</p>
<p>ner in which Mr. O'Connell spoke of Sir Robert Peel and the Duke
</p>
<p>of Wellington. The language applied to those distinguished indi-
</p>
<p>viduals is merely a personal matter, and does not prove the intention
</p>
<p>imputed to the traversers by the Attorney-General. When Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell spoke of having more physical force at his disposal than
</p>
<p>there was at Waterloo, he meant nothing more than that the question
</p>
<p>supported by such a mass of people, and by such a combination and
</p>
<p>concentration of moral power, must be discussed and considered. It
</p>
<p>was a mere boastful expression, that such a number of persons were
</p>
<p>formidable, just as the 75,000 men came to Hillsborough, shoulder to
</p>
<p>shoulder, and must be listened to, and their demands considered and
</p>
<p>discussed. The Attorney-General, immediately before he alluded to
</p>
<p>the meeting at Mullaghmast, introduced a singular topic into his speech.
</p>
<p>He said that a question was put in Parliament, and an answer given,
</p>
<p>which was decisive on the subject of the Repeal of the Union, and
</p>
<p>that nevertheless, the meeting at Mullaghmast was held five days af-
</p>
<p>498
</p>
<p>terwards. Why did he introduce this subject ? Clearly for this rea-
</p>
<p>son ; to impress your minds with the belief and conviction that, as the
</p>
<p>parties endeavouring to procure a Repeal of the Union knew that lit-
</p>
<p>tle was to be expected from Parliament, their object must have been
</p>
<p>unlawful. Now, Gentlemen, I shall take the liberty of saying, that
</p>
<p>tbat was an unconstitutional argument for the Attorney-General to
</p>
<p>make use of. Neither you nor I are bound to notice nor bound to
</p>
<p>read the speeches which are made in Parliament. To force us to read
</p>
<p>all the speeches which are made there, would bean intolerable act of
</p>
<p>despotism, against which the spirit of the country would revolt. It
</p>
<p>is only by a breach of privilege that the proceedings in Parliament are
</p>
<p>ever published at all. Lord Mansfield declared that he never felt him-
</p>
<p>self bound by the resolutions of either House, and that if such resolu-
</p>
<p>tions were passed the Court was bound not to listen to them. They
</p>
<p>are not law, nor can they affect us in any respect, and therefore my
</p>
<p>learned friend's observation was not supported by law, and was at va-
</p>
<p>riance with constitutional rights ; but, since he did introduce them,
</p>
<p>I shall not hesitate to call your attention to what passed at the same
</p>
<p>debate, on the 9th of May. Viscount Jocelyn said : " I rise for the
</p>
<p>" purpose of asking my Right Honourable friend at the head of the
</p>
<p>" Government, whether the Government is aware of the fearful ex-
</p>
<p>" citement which has prevailed for some weeks past on the subject
</p>
<p>" of the Repeal of the Union ; and if so, whether the Government
</p>
<p>" is determined to take any steps for its repression ? I likewise
</p>
<p>" wish to know whether my Right Honourable friend has any objec-
</p>
<p>" tion to state, for the satisfaction of the loyal people of Ireland,
</p>
<p>" whether or not the Government is determined to maintain, at all
</p>
<p>" risks and hazards, the inviolability of the Legislative Union be-
</p>
<p>" tween Great Britain and Ireland." Sir Robert Peel said : " I
</p>
<p>" rejoice that my noble friend has given me an opportunity of making,
</p>
<p>" on the part of the Government, a public declaration on the impor-
</p>
<p>" tant subject to which he has called the attention of the House;
</p>
<p>" and I think it necessary on this occasion to remind the House of-
</p>
<p>" what has been, within no very distant period, the publicly recorded

</p>
<p>" opinion and engagements of the Crown and both Houses of Par-
</p>
<p>" liament with respect to the Legislative Union of Great Britain and
</p>
<p>" Ireland." Sir Robert Peel referred to the King's speech, and the
</p>
<p>Addresses of both Houses in 1834, and continued: " On the part
</p>
<p>" of Her Majesty, I am authorized to repeat the declaration made by
</p>
<p>" King William ; and I have no doubt that the present Houses of
</p>
<p>" Parliament would, if necessary, be prepared to fulfil the engage-
</p>
<p>" ments into which their predecessors entered. I can state to my
</p>
<p>" noble friend that Her Majesty's Government in this country and
</p>
<p>' in Ireland are fully alive to the evils which arise from the existing
</p>
<p>" agitation in the latter country in respect to the Repeal of the Union.
</p>
<p>" And I further state this, that there is no influence, no power, no
</p>
<p>" authority, which the prerogative of the Crown, and the existing
</p>
<p>" law give to the Government, which shall not be exercised for the
</p>
<p>" purpose of maintaining the Union ; the dissolution of which would
</p>
<p>" involve, not merely the Repeal of an Act of Parliament, but the dis-
</p>
<p>499
</p>
<p>" memberment of this great Empire. Of tliis I am confident,
</p>
<p>" that an executive Government can lose nothing of moral or
</p>
<p>" real strength by confiding as long as possible in the ordinary
</p>
<p>" powers which the law and Constitution give them, and in being un-
</p>
<p>" willing, without urgent necessity, to disparage those ordinary powers
</p>
<p>" by asking for increased authority; but I do not hesitate one moment
</p>
<p>" to say, that if such necessity should arise, Her Majesty's Government
</p>
<p>" will, without an instant's hesitation, appeal to Parliament for additional
</p>
<p>" and effectual powers, which will enable them to avert the mighty evil
</p>
<p>" that would arise, not only to the country, but more especially to Ire-
</p>
<p>" land, from a successful attempt to sever the connexion between the
</p>
<p>" two countries." Sir Robert Peel then referred to the declaration of
</p>
<p>Lord Althorp, which the Attorney-General has quoted. Parliament
</p>
<p>sat until the 20th of August ; the most of the meetings took place
</p>
<p>before that period, without any further step being taken by the Minis-
</p>
<p>ter in the way of legislation. Did he not, thereby, leave an impres-
</p>
<p>sion on the minds of the people, that, however he disliked the agita-
</p>
<p>tion, it was not illegal; not unconstitutional. He does not answer the
</p>
<p>question which was put to him ; on the contrary, he carefully avoids
</p>
<p>it. Since, therefore, that debate has been referred to, am I not
</p>
<p>entitled to rely on the answer of Sir Robert Peel, to show, that in the
</p>
<p>opinion of the Ministry, the meetings were perfectly legal and per-
</p>
<p>fectly constitutional ? That answer has been severely criticised by
</p>
<p>Lord Cottenham, the late Chancellor of England, in the House of
</p>
<p>Lords. His Lordship said it was unconstitutional for any Minister of
</p>
<p>the Crown to declare that he had communication with the Sovereign,
</p>
<p>on any subject. He said that the only constitutional mode of communi
</p>
<p>cation with the Sovereign was through the Parliament by an address,
</p>
<p>and the answer to it ; and he distinctly states, and gives powerful rea-
</p>
<p>sons for his opinion, that the observations made by Sir Robert Peel
</p>
<p>were unfortunate, and unconstitutional. I therefore do not see how a
</p>
<p>reference to this debate can serve the purposes of this prosecution. It
</p>
<p>is admitted that the head of the Government did not, up to May,
</p>
<p>think that the meetings were illegal ; his eyes were open to all that

</p>
<p>was passing in the country ; he was called on to suppress the meet-
</p>
<p>ings ; if he thought they were illegal and improper. Parliament sat
</p>
<p>until August ; he took no measures ; he asked for no further powers ;
</p>
<p>and he now directs the Attorney-General to come into Court, and
</p>
<p>asks you, a jury of Irishmen, for a verdict condemnatory of the meet-
</p>
<p>ings which took place before May, condemnatory of the meetings
</p>
<p>which took place up to the month of August, although he did
</p>
<p>not think it right to ask for any power to repress them. Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, looking to what took place at the meetings at Mullaghmast,
</p>
<p>it might have been said that the speech made by Mr. O'Connell might
</p>
<p>be considered violent and improper. Part of it may be so; but
</p>
<p>you will observe, that in the correct report of his speech, so far from
</p>
<p>encouraging or exciting religious distinctions, he asserts, that, the
</p>
<p>massacre which took place there was not perpetrated by Protestants
</p>
<p>on Catholics, but by Catholics on each other. That proves that his
</p>
<p>distinct object was not to excite religious distinctions, but the reverse ;
</p>
<p>500
</p>
<p>and you will again observe, that these are his own observations, and
</p>
<p>not the act of Mr. Duffy, or of any of the other parties combined in
</p>
<p>this prosecution.
</p>
<p>I shall now call your attention to another subject, which was
</p>
<p>much relied on by the Attorney General, that is, the form, cha-
</p>
<p>racter, and nature of the processions, as he called them, by which
</p>
<p>these meetings were got together. The Attorney General endea-
</p>
<p>voured to fix on them the character of a military array, no mat-
</p>
<p>ter how discordant the music, or how irregular the march. It was
</p>
<p>proved in the case of Redford v. Birley, to which I have already
</p>
<p>alluded, that there were processions, that a number of men were re-
</p>
<p>gularly drilled, that they marched by torch-light to attend the meet,
</p>
<p>ings ; and I now ask you to apply the reasoning used in that case to
</p>
<p>the circumstances in evidence before you, which are as distinct and
</p>
<p>as different as one state of facts can be from another. But first,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, where is the law which prevents men from
</p>
<p>marching in procession? The Attorney General has stated to you
</p>
<p>that the meetings and processions were all of a similar character. Let
</p>
<p>us take the Donnybrook procession as a specimen. You all saw the
</p>
<p>procession which preceded that meeting. You all saw a number of
</p>
<p>decently dressed respectable artizans, marching through the the city
</p>
<p>to Donnybrook. They passed the Castle gates, under the eyes of
</p>
<p>the Government and of the Attorney General. That was a type of
</p>
<p>all the meetings. Would you believe any man who would venture
</p>
<p>to say, that he felt tarror or alarm, either for his person or his pro-
</p>
<p>perty, from that meeting? Ex uno disce omnes. This meeting was
</p>
<p>peaceable, tolerant, constitutional, legal ; and you must infer that all
</p>
<p>the others were similar. But where is the law which says, that pro-
</p>
<p>cessions such as you witnessed on that occasion, and such as took
</p>
<p>place at Tullamore, and at all the other monster meetings, are
</p>
<p>illegal ? You remember the cross-examination of Mr. Jolly, who de-
</p>
<p>scribes them as marching in regular columns, infantry and cavalry, the
</p>
<p>women behind the men on pillions. You remember one of the Po-
</p>
<p>licemen giving evidence of a speech of Mr. O'Connell's, in which he

</p>
<p>said that all the farmers would be gentlemen, and the gentlemen lords;
</p>
<p>he was to be Lord Ballincollig himself. You may judge whether a
</p>
<p>man of Mr. O'Connell's good sense ever made such an observation,
</p>
<p>and you are now called on to take this as proof of a conspiracy on the
</p>
<p>part of Mr. Duffy. The witness said that the people marched in or-
</p>
<p>der, came in order, and returned in order. 1 will draw your atten-
</p>
<p>tion to a few processions in England, but before I do so I will ask the
</p>
<p>Solicitor-General whether it is illegal at common law for men to meet
</p>
<p>and walk in procession with colours, flags, and music. Will he say
</p>
<p>that these circumstances make an assemblage an illegal one. He was
</p>
<p>not a law officer of the Crown at the time the bill for the suppression
</p>
<p>of the Orange processions was passed. Why, Gentlemen, for 150
</p>
<p>years the Orangemen of the North met in thousands on particular
</p>
<p>anniversaries; they marched with flags, banners, and music, and very
</p>
<p>often they had firearms, and sometimes, if they were interfered with,
</p>
<p>they used them, and then they were tried for a riot. But will my
</p>
<p>learned friend tell me that they were guilty of an illegal act by meet-
</p>
<p>501
</p>
<p>ing and marching to commemorate the advent of William the
</p>
<p>Third to this country, and that because they so marched in proces-
</p>
<p>sion they were acting illegally, and were to be dealt with by the com-
</p>
<p>mon law? Gentlemen, he cannot do so; it is proved that they were
</p>
<p>not illegal by the fact that it was necessary to pass an Act of Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment to put them down. Processions with flags and music, and with
</p>
<p>arms, if nothing more occurred, were considered perfectly legal in
</p>
<p>the good old days of Protestant ascendancy. The difficulty was, to
</p>
<p>know how to deal with them, and Lord Stanley, then, as now, one of
</p>
<p>the Ministers of the Crown, thought fit, by an Act of Parliament, to
</p>
<p>put down the Orange processions in the North, leaving it open
</p>
<p>for all other persons to meet together and to walk in procession
</p>
<p>with music and banners, or with anything else they pleased. It
</p>
<p>was a mock liberality indeed which put down one class of men,
</p>
<p>and not all alike. They should have aimed at all or at none ; but
</p>
<p>they have no right now to come to a jury, and because of a defect
</p>
<p>or omission in the act, to ask them to declare that processions are
</p>
<p>illegal at common law. On the occasion of the introduction of that
</p>
<p>bill by Lord Stanley, one of the Judges on that bench took part in
</p>
<p>the debate. Mr. Crampton said : " There seems to be this complaint
</p>
<p>" against the present measure  that it does not go far enough, and put
</p>
<p>" down associations of a very different nature from those it intended
</p>
<p>" to touch. The object of my right honourable friend is not to pre-
</p>
<p>" vent anything like an exhibition of general feeling, but is simply to
</p>
<p>" put down those party processions which have been productive of so
</p>
<p>" much mischief in Ireland, and have caused so much bloodshed, and
</p>
<p>" to the suppression of which the common law has not been found
</p>
<p>" adequate. There is no wish on the part of the Government to
</p>
<p>" prevent constitutional meetings ; but it is absolutely necessary, for
</p>
<p>" the tranquillity of the country, that those processions, which have
</p>
<p>" been such a frightful source of crime and bloodshed in Ireland,
</p>
<p>" should cease to be held. My honourable friend, the member for
</p>
<p>" Downpatrick, says that the present law is amply sufficient for put-
</p>
<p>" ting down those processions ; but, after mature consideration on the

</p>
<p>" subject, I entertain an entirely different opinion." Mr. Lefroy,
</p>
<p>who now administers justice in another Court with great ability, re-
</p>
<p>sisted the bill : he said, " I admit that there is a portion of the bill
</p>
<p>" which may not be considered objectionable in itself  I mean that
</p>
<p>" clause which makes it an offence to assemble at those meetings with
</p>
<p>" arms ; but I contend that that clause is wholly unnecessary, because
</p>
<p>" to meet with arms would be an offence at common law, and, there-
</p>
<p>" fore, there is no occasion to legislate upon it ; but for all the rest of
</p>
<p>" the bill, going as it does to make it a misdemeanor to meet un-
</p>
<p>" armed, and merely wearing those badges, which surely are not more
</p>
<p>" offensive to his Majesty's Government than tri-coloured flags, is a
</p>
<p>" measure of the most partial, unprecedented, and unjust legislation."
</p>
<p>And Mr. Stanley answered : "Why, then, says the honourable gen-
</p>
<p>" tleman the member for the University of Dublin, there are reli-
</p>
<p>" gious festivals set apart, which are directed by the liturgy of the
</p>
<p>" Church to be celebrated ; and he asks, Do you intend to prevent
</p>
<p>502
</p>
<p>" us from going to church, and celebrating a festival, the celebration
</p>
<p>" of which is prescribed by our own liturgy ? My answer to that
</p>
<p>" is: Do your religion and your liturgy prescribe that you should at-
</p>
<p>" tend at church with party banners and ensigns, and with loaded
</p>
<p>" muskets, with the avowed intention, or, if not with the intention,
</p>
<p>w having the effect, of exciting against you the angry feelings of that
</p>
<p>" portion of the community who differ from you in the views they
</p>
<p>" take of the events which you are assembled together to celebrate?"
</p>
<p>That is to say, that it was lawful to march in procession with loaded
</p>
<p>muskets. He refused to extend that law so as to affect meetings like
</p>
<p>those; and you are now called upon, at the beck of the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General of the same Ministry who refused to extend the law so as to
</p>
<p>put down all processions, to put down processions like the pre-
</p>
<p>sent, which might have been effected by that Act. Two persons
</p>
<p>in the House of Commons opposed that Act. One of those men
</p>
<p>was the traverser, Daniel O'Connell. He had to consider the case
</p>
<p>of his old enemies, the Orangemen of Ireland ; and what course did
</p>
<p>he take ? He might have then spoken of them as he pleased.
</p>
<p>He might then have forgotten their virtues, and remembered only
</p>
<p>their vices and their faults. He might have given his vote to extin-
</p>
<p>guish their rights. He did not do so. He distinctly said that " no
</p>
<p>" case had been made out for the measure, and that, therefore,
</p>
<p>" though a Catholic, he should oppose it." There was one other
</p>
<p>gentleman amongst the few Irish representatives who opposed it ;
</p>
<p>him you are also called upon to convict. The son of Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>declared on the same manly, sensible, and constitutional grounds, he
</p>
<p>said, that " if men were wrong in their opinions the power of the law
</p>
<p>" was sufficiently stringent to put them down ; but that they should
</p>
<p>" be allowed to state their opinions freely. For his part, he thought
</p>
<p>" they had a right to speak their sentiments. He spoke the opinions
</p>
<p>" of a large and respectable portion of the population of Ireland, and
</p>
<p>" resisted the measure." Will the law officers of the Crown now tell
</p>
<p>you that marching  I put it that they marched regularly in procession,
</p>
<p>with music, flags, and banners  will it be asserted that such marching,

</p>
<p>if nothing else occurs, is illegal ? Will it be said that it required the
</p>
<p>interposition of an Act of Parliament to put down the Orange pro-
</p>
<p>cessions, and yet that you, a jury, are to declare that processions, by
</p>
<p>another portion of her Majesty's subjects, are illegal and unconsti-
</p>
<p>tutional. I will now read to you the recital of the Act of Parliament ;
</p>
<p>it is 2, 3 Will. IV. c. 118: " Whereas great numbers of persons
</p>
<p>" belonging to different religious denominations, and distinguished
</p>
<p>" respectively by various emblems, expressive of party feelings and
</p>
<p>" differences, are in the habit of meeting and marching in procession in
</p>
<p>" Ireland, upon certain festivals and anniversaries, and other occasions,
</p>
<p>" and such processions are calculated to create and perpetuate ani-
</p>
<p>" mosities, and have been found to occasion frequent and sanguinary
</p>
<p>" conflicts between different classes of her Majesty's subjects, for pre-
</p>
<p>" vention whereof, and in order to guard against the recurrence of
</p>
<p>" the tumults, riots, and disorders arising out of such processions, be
</p>
<p>" it enacted, &c." I submit, therefore, Gentlemen, to your better
</p>
<p>503
</p>
<p>judgment, that these processions were perfectly legal. They existed
</p>
<p>for 150 years, they are part of the history of your country, they were
</p>
<p>a hundred times more formidable than any which have been proved
</p>
<p>before you on this occasion, they passed without objection, it re-
</p>
<p>quired an Act of the Legislature to put them down, and you
</p>
<p>will say to the Government, " as you did not think proper to put
</p>
<p>down all party processions, but choose to legislate exclusively against
</p>
<p>the Protestants of the North, we will leave you to deal with these
</p>
<p>processions as you can, you require an Act of Parliament to make
</p>
<p>these processions unlawful." Gentlemen, you ought to dismiss from
</p>
<p>your minds these angry speeches ; if a man is to be judged by extracts
</p>
<p>from his speeches, no man can be safe. Mr. O'Connell's real object
</p>
<p>was, to discuss the subject of the Repeal of the Union. It was not a
</p>
<p>mask to conceal a different design, and other parties are not to be af-
</p>
<p>fected by any rash, intemperate, or heated language into which he
</p>
<p>may have been betrayed in discussing that question.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, it is insisted on, that these vast meetings were collected
</p>
<p>for the purpose of exciting discontent ; it is not stated what kind of dis-
</p>
<p>content. A man may be discontented without being a conspirator. A
</p>
<p>hungry man is discontented, and Cicero, with all his eloquence, would
</p>
<p>not make him a contented man ; but he is not a conspirator. The ad-
</p>
<p>vocates for the abolition of slavery were discontented. They said that
</p>
<p>slavery was abhorrent to the law of England, that it was against the
</p>
<p>law of God. They combined and they confederated, and they com-
</p>
<p>pelled the Legislature to concede that act of justice and humanity, and
</p>
<p>but for that union and that discussion slavery might still remain a blot
</p>
<p>and a disgrace to English humanity, braving the vengeance of Heaven
</p>
<p>itself. To say therefore, that to excite discontent is criminal, is to
</p>
<p>say just nothing at all. The Legislature itself has felt the wisdom of
</p>
<p>discontent, and has made laws which would never have been made
</p>
<p>but for that discontent. In the same way, the people of England be-
</p>
<p>came discontented before the passing of the Reform Bill; and that
</p>
<p>measure, which was before resisted, became the law of the land. It
</p>
<p>is not therefore a crime to be discontented with any law, and that does

</p>
<p>not make my client a conspirator, unless he has done something dan-
</p>
<p>gerous, illegal, or subversive of the Constitution. The word discon-
</p>
<p>tent may be better understood by coupling it with disaffection. The
</p>
<p>charge in this indictment is curious. It is not a charge of discontent
</p>
<p>or disaffection towards or against Her Majesty, nor against the form
</p>
<p>of the Constitution. I cannot clearly understand what it means ; the
</p>
<p>conspiracy is not to excite discontent against the Constitution. I ad-
</p>
<p>mit that would be criminal. Nor does it relate to the Sovereign or her
</p>
<p>authority. I admit, that to excite discontent against the form of the
</p>
<p>Constitution would be illegal. Therefore the question is, what is the
</p>
<p>form of the Constitution ? It consists of the Sovereign, the House of
</p>
<p>Lords, and the House of Commons. To excite discontent and disaffec-
</p>
<p>tion against the existence of the House of Commons would be sedi-
</p>
<p>tious, and if parties combined to do so, it would be a conspiracy. To
</p>
<p>excite discontent and disaffection to the privileges of the Peers or
</p>
<p>the prerogatives of the Crown would be criminal, and to combine to
</p>
<p>504
</p>
<p>do so would be a conspiracy. To excite discontent against Royalty,
</p>
<p>to curtail the prerogatives of the Crown, to say the Crown was an un-
</p>
<p>necessary part of the Constitution, would be illegal  a combination to
</p>
<p>do so would be a conspiracy. Thus, Gentlemen, to combine to sub-
</p>
<p>vert the House of Commons, to limit the privileges of the Peers, and
</p>
<p>to curtail the prerogatives of the Crown would, I admit, be an illegal
</p>
<p>combination ; but to admit that the Constitution, consisting of Queen,
</p>
<p>Lords, and Commons, is the best, the safest, and the most beneficial
</p>
<p>form of government which the wit and wisdom of man ever contrived
</p>
<p>for the protection and the prosperity of the people, and to wish to
</p>
<p>extend the beneficent principles of that Constitution to every part of
</p>
<p>the empire, never can be held to be discontent or disaffection to that
</p>
<p>Constitution which you praise and applaud, and which you desire to
</p>
<p>have extended to the land of your birth. Therefore, Gentlemen of
</p>
<p>the Jury, all that is said in the indictment about disaffection and dis-
</p>
<p>content, applies to an effort, not to put down the House of Commons,
</p>
<p>but to restore it ; not to abolish the House of Peers, but to bring it
</p>
<p>back where its presence is so desirable ; not to limit the prerogatives
</p>
<p>of the Crown, but, perhaps improperly, to extend them. How can
</p>
<p>these acts be treated as overt acts of an illegal combination to carry
</p>
<p>the Repeal of the Union by unjust and unlawful means, as if conspira-
</p>
<p>tors were seeking in darkness and in subtlety to subvert the throne?
</p>
<p>The object of the traversers was to reform the constitution, and if you
</p>
<p>were to hear it announced that a new and a beneficial Constitution was
</p>
<p>obtained by every country in Europe, would you not rejoice, and if
</p>
<p>you would, how can it be disaffection or disloyalty to express so much
</p>
<p>for the Sovereign as an attachment for the great and glorious prin-
</p>
<p>ciples on which the Constitution is based, and which every freeman
</p>
<p>should sustain and consolidate. If these persons' desire was to re-
</p>
<p>store the Constitution which they conceived they had lost, that is
</p>
<p>not disloyalty ; there is nothing criminal in that, in any point of
</p>
<p>view ; and therefore it is not an overt act of the conspiracy alleged
</p>
<p>in the indictment. Consider yourselves, for a moment, the zeal of
</p>
<p>my client and the other traversers for a Repeal of the Union ; place

<p>yourselves in their position  adopt their intention  is not that the
</p>
<p>way in which you would discuss the matter? What, suppose you
</p>
<p>were of opinion that the Union had been carried by unfair and dis-
</p>
<p>honest means, that you conscientiously believed it to be an evil to
</p>
<p>your country, what mode would you resort to to gain your object,
</p>
<p>and to repeal that fatal measure ? Reflect on the past history of
</p>
<p>Ireland ; what course would suggest itself to get from the Imperial
</p>
<p>Parliament the measure which you sought ? An unreflecting man
</p>
<p>might say, why not ask it from the Crown ? Why not rely on the
</p>
<p>justice of the cause, and on the force of truth ? Why, Gentlemen of
</p>
<p>the Jury, some Irishman might say, we did apply to the Crown, we
</p>
<p>did rely on the justice of our cause, and we found it a broken reed.
</p>
<p>We did so, and we gained nothing. We found that popular strength
</p>
<p>and popular organization were the only means which we could resort
</p>
<p>to with success ; we found that claims which were denied to justice,
</p>
<p>were granted to the moral, the peaceable, the formidable organiza-
</p>
<p>50a
</p>
<p>tion of popular opinion. What is the history of Ireland for the last
</p>
<p>eighty years  what but an account of a series of Societies, of Asso-
</p>
<p>ciations, and of Clubs for the attainment of one thing or another?
</p>
<p>Almost all the measures which they sought, they have gained. They
</p>
<p>are now the law of the land, proving either that they ought to have
</p>
<p>been granted at once, or to have been denied for ever. It is a very
</p>
<p>questionable doctrine indeed, that political privileges and rights
</p>
<p>should be withheld until a great and formidable organization arises,
</p>
<p>when they are granted only because it is necessary to concede them
</p>
<p>in order to check discontent, and to teach the people that great and
</p>
<p>painful secret, to rely on popular organization, for to it every thing will
</p>
<p>be granted, and without it every thing will be denied. See what has been
</p>
<p>the state of the country since the year 1760. In that year the first
</p>
<p>Catholic Association was formed. They obtained a relaxation of the
</p>
<p>penal code in 1770. They struggled, and by popular organization they
</p>
<p>obtained what ought to have been granted fifty years before. While
</p>
<p>they were seeking to redress their grievances by obtaining their civil
</p>
<p>rights, another body of men conspired, combined, confederated, and
</p>
<p>agreed to rescue Ireland from contempt and ruin. That body was
</p>
<p>the Volunteers of Ireland. At that moment what was the condition
</p>
<p>of Ireland ? All commerce with her was interdicted, her trade was
</p>
<p>prostrated, her manufactures were destroyed, she was a country with-
</p>
<p>out commerce, her Parliament did not represent the larger portion
</p>
<p>of her inhabitants. The Volunteers were discontented at this, and
</p>
<p>well it is for you to-day that they were so. They were not then
</p>
<p>called disloyal or disaffected, and yet they conspired, combined, con-
</p>
<p>federated, and agreed to obtain justice for their native land. All
</p>
<p>that the genius of Swift, the learning of Molyneux, and the patriotism
</p>
<p>of Lucas had failed to obtain, was yielded to men with arms in their
</p>
<p>hands. They combined, and but for that combination we should yet
</p>
<p>be the serfs of England. They were discontented with a law, they
</p>
<p>remonstrated and they failed, and then they struggled for its repeal.
</p>
<p>The Catholic Association having learned how concessions were to
</p>
<p>be obtained, formed themselves into a new body or general com-

</p>
<p>mittee of delegates, which held its meetings until 1792. In 1806
</p>
<p>a new association was formed, and was renewed in 1810 under the
</p>
<p>auspices of Mr. Scully. In 1823 the last Association was formed,
</p>
<p>it embraced a large portion of the Irish people. The aristocracy,
</p>
<p>the gentry, the priesthood, and the people became members of it.
</p>
<p>They had their rules, and the rules of the Repeal Association are
</p>
<p>almost fac similes of them. They met, they debated, they pub-
</p>
<p>lished, they subscribed their money in pursuance of their common
</p>
<p>object, which was the repeal of an Act of Parliament, with a zeal
</p>
<p>unequalled in the history of the country. They had their rent col-
</p>
<p>lectors, and they collected rent, but they broke no law. That Associa-
</p>
<p>tion ceased in 1825, but it was not in consequence of a prosecution
</p>
<p>for conspiracy. Meetings were held in every part of the country.
</p>
<p>A simultaneous meeting was held on the 21st of January, 1830, at
</p>
<p>which no less than a million and a half of persons were present.
</p>
<p>They had a common object ; they assembled under the sanction of
</p>
<p>3"t
</p>
<p>506
</p>
<p>a law. The great Crown lawyer of the day, Mr. Plunket, was then
</p>
<p>Attorney-General. He was desirous to put them down, hut there
</p>
<p>was no prosecution. Under the very eyes of the Executive this
</p>
<p>combination was formed, and yet they did not interfere with it.
</p>
<p>Simultaneous meetings were held, and so extensively were their
</p>
<p>proceedings promulgated through the country, that 8,000 copies of the
</p>
<p>Weekly Register were circulated every week. The Brunswick clubs
</p>
<p>sprang up. Their object was to resist Emancipation, and at length
</p>
<p>the confederation, which had existed since the year 1760 was put
</p>
<p>down in 1829. But what was the lesson taught to the people of this
</p>
<p>country ? that by popular and peaceful organization, and peaceful
</p>
<p>agitation, they would become victorious over the interest of the
</p>
<p>aristocracy, the conscience of the Sovereign, the wish of the English
</p>
<p>people, and the inclination of almost the entire of the British Par-
</p>
<p>liament. That was the system and the policy observed by England
</p>
<p>towards this country, like an angry and capricious parent, who one
</p>
<p>moment chides his child without cause, and the next rewards her
</p>
<p>with a sugar plum. This agitation continued for a long period ;
</p>
<p>what were the Government about all that time ? Why did they not
</p>
<p>proceed to suppress, according to the spirit of the Constitution, by
</p>
<p>legislation ? The first Catholic Association was suppressed by the
</p>
<p>33 Geo. Til. c. 29. That Act was passed because they had ap-
</p>
<p>pointed delegates, and it was intended by it to put down that dele-
</p>
<p>gation. It proves that an Act of Parliament was necessary to put
</p>
<p>down such a combination, which was legal at common law. The
</p>
<p>strongest argument is deducible from that fact in support of the
</p>
<p>legality of this Association. The Catholic Association debated and
</p>
<p>agitated ; they passed resolutions, they collected rent, yet they were
</p>
<p>admitted to be a legal society by the first lawyers in the House of
</p>
<p>Commons. What then was the obvious duty of the Government? It
</p>
<p>was the course pointed out by Lord Jocelyn in May last ! When all
</p>
<p>the associations of a similar nature had been admitted to be legal, the
</p>
<p>only course was to put this Association down by an Act of Parliament.
</p>
<p>I have therefore the clearest authority for saying that such an Asso-

<p>ciation is not illegal ; cannot be dealt with by the common law ; and
</p>
<p>can only be put down by an Act of Parliament. Common law and
</p>
<p>common sense were alike on the side of Lord Plunket, and that the
</p>
<p>principles which he propounded were founded on truth is clearly evi-
</p>
<p>denced by subsequent events, for the Government, finding it utterly
</p>
<p>impossible to crush the Association by a common law proceeding,
</p>
<p>were obliged to have recourse to Parliament for new and more ex-
</p>
<p>tensive powers. Lord Brougham's speech on that memorable" de-
</p>
<p>bate is one which for brilliancy of thought, and energy of expression
</p>
<p>must ever stand preeminent ; he said : " The most extraordinary
</p>
<p>" charge is that which has been advanced by some Honourable Gen-
</p>
<p>" tlemen, who say that they r would not care for the bluster, impetu-
</p>
<p>" osity, and violence of faction ; but what they most dread is, the
</p>
<p>" dense, quiet, and uninterrupted stillness prevailing in Ireland. This
</p>
<p>'< they consider more fatal than the period of 1782, when the Vo-
</p>
<p>lunteers assembled ; that of 1793, when the Jacobins assembled;
</p>
<p>507
</p>
<p>" or that of 179S, when the standard of rebellion was hoisted in the
</p>
<p>" country. The more quiet, it seems, the more danger. Every one
</p>
<p>" remembers the line, 
</p>
<p>* ' My wound is great, because it is so small,'
</p>
<p>" as well as the addition which a wit made to it,
</p>
<p>" ' Then 'twould be greater were it none at all.'
</p>
<p>u Of a similar character is the apprehension that some persons enter-
</p>
<p>" tain, founded on the existing tranquillity of Ireland." Upon the
</p>
<p>same principle, it is contended that the danger of the present move-
</p>
<p>ment bears an exact proportion to the tranquillity and good conduct
</p>
<p>of the people. Gentlemen of the Jury, two Acts of Parliament were
</p>
<p>passed on this subject. The first was the 6 Geo. IV. c.4. It enacts, that
</p>
<p>" every society or other body of persons assuming, or in any manner
</p>
<p>" exercising the power of acting for the purpose or under the pretence
</p>
<p>" of procuring the redress of grievances in Church and State, or for car -
</p>
<p>" rying on or defending actions civil or criminal, which, or the mem-
</p>
<p>" bers thereof, shall for the purposes thereof continue or renew their
</p>
<p>" meetings, whether under the same or under any different name ov
</p>
<p>" names, by adjournment for more than fourteen days, or collecting
</p>
<p>" or receiving money, shall be deemed an unlawful combination and
</p>
<p>" confederacy." Next came an Act which I think the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General might as well have refrained from alluding to. It was called
</p>
<p>the Coercion Act, and expired in two years. A more severe or
</p>
<p>tyrannical Act is not to be found on the Statute Book, and it is to be
</p>
<p>regretted that such an Act was introduced, and carried by a Ministry
</p>
<p>from whom one would rather have expected measures favourable to
</p>
<p>the liberties of the people. But the inference to be drawn from the
</p>
<p>passing of that Act is, that it was necessary, in order to suppress
</p>
<p>associations, that an Act of Parliament should be passed, because
</p>
<p>all associations and societies of this description were not at va-
</p>
<p>riance with the common law. And if by-gone Associations
</p>
<p>were not contrary to the principles of the common law, how can
</p>
<p>you be called upon to declare that the Repeal Association, which
</p>
<p>differs from them in no way except in being more mild and

</p>
<p>less comprehensive in its constitution than any other, is, unlike
</p>
<p>them, at variance with the common law ? In all the other cases,
</p>
<p>the Government were most anxious to have put down those asso-
</p>
<p>ciations by the ordinary intervention of the common law, if they
</p>
<p>could have done so. But they found it impossible to do so, and there-
</p>
<p>fore it was that they had to apply to Parliament for further powers.
</p>
<p>If those associations were legal, surely an association formed for the
</p>
<p>lawful purpose of repealing a law is not in itself proof of a conspiracy.
</p>
<p>I shall now draw your attention to another branch of the case, to
</p>
<p>which you are naturally led  the constitution of the Repeal Associa-
</p>
<p>tion. The Attorney-General described it to you as an Association
</p>
<p>in which a number of persons were combined, who by means of
</p>
<p>secret symbols endeavoured to carry out their wicked projects, and
</p>
<p>he compared it to the societies referred to in the Report of the
</p>
<p>Secret Committee of the House of Commons in 1797. The first
</p>
<p>508
</p>
<p>thing which the Attorney-General relied on as showing the nature
</p>
<p>and constitution of the Repeal Association, and the fell intent of
</p>
<p>the conspiracy, was the Associates' card. I cannot, for the life of
</p>
<p>me, discover what evidence of conspiracy there is on the face of this
</p>
<p>document, unless a sketch of the Bank of Ireland, and a very bad
</p>
<p>one by the way, can be viewed in that light. Perhaps, the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy is evidenced by these words, it was and shall be. The next
</p>
<p>document is the Members' card, and my learned friend grew serious
</p>
<p>when he described it to you. He would find nothing in it, but I
</p>
<p>find something to which 1 think it important to draw your attention.
</p>
<p>The first words that J find on it are God save the Queen. The next
</p>
<p>document is the card, for which the parties pay 1. It first begins
</p>
<p>with a statement of certain statistical facts ; it states the population
</p>
<p>of Ireland, its revenue, its size, as compared with other countries in
</p>
<p>Europe, the number of men which it supplied to the English army
</p>
<p>and navy, during the last war ; and it concludes with the fact that
</p>
<p>Ireland has not a Parliament. At the four corners are written the
</p>
<p>names of four battles, Clontarf, Benburb, Beal-an-Atha Buidhe,
</p>
<p>and Limerick, and from that the Attorney-General infers that the
</p>
<p>object of the Association is not the Repeal of the Union, but a
</p>
<p>wicked and unlawful one. He says, it is highly criminal to ad-
</p>
<p>vert to these historical facts. If so, the Scotch nation should
</p>
<p>be put on their trial for conspiracy, and Burns was a conspirator,
</p>
<p>must be handed down to posterity as a conspirator, because he wrote
</p>
<p>some beautiful lines on the battle of Banockburn. In the centre of the
</p>
<p>card is a flag, with the representation of a shamrock, and on one leaf is
</p>
<p>the word Protestant, on another Presbyterian, on the third, Dis-
</p>
<p>senter, and on the fourth, Catholic. In the centre, is the motto Quis
</p>
<p>sepavabit. That does not look like a conspiracy. It is rather like a
</p>
<p>charitable and generous attempt to unite all classes of religionists in
</p>
<p>the same bond of union, and to bury in oblivion all sectarian differ-
</p>
<p>ences. My learned friend, the Attorney-General, did not allude to
</p>
<p>this motto ; and yet, I think, it is of no small importance, for it proves
</p>
<p>that the Association was not instituted for the purpose of spreading

</p>
<p>dissension among different classes of Her Majesty's subjects, but ex-
</p>
<p>pressly for the purpose of promoting good will and good fellowship
</p>
<p>among all classes of the community. That is the nature of this
</p>
<p>wicked document. I do not see how it can lead you to the conclu-
</p>
<p>sion that the traversers have entered into the wicked conspiracy which
</p>
<p>has been attributed to them. I next come to the Volunteers' Card ;
</p>
<p>and were it not for the valuable assistance, which I am sure I shall
</p>
<p>receive from your Lordships in the interpretation of it, I should ap-
</p>
<p>proach the task with fear and trembling. My Lords, I find a like-
</p>
<p>ness, faithful, I am to presume, of a celebrated Irish legislator, who
</p>
<p>rejoiced in the appellation of Ollam Fodhla. I confess, with shame,
</p>
<p>my incompetency to treat of the merits of this gentleman; but my
</p>
<p>Lord Chief Justice, who is deeply read in Irish lore, is conversant, no
</p>
<p>doubt, with his writings, and will state to you, Gentlemen, the laws
</p>
<p>which were propounded by this illustrious Solon. He will explain to
</p>
<p>you the principles which were inculcated by this wise legislator, and
</p>
<p>509
</p>
<p>the nature of the wicked, abominable, and seditious crime of putting
</p>
<p>the somewhat formidable name of Ollam Fodhla, and his exceedingly
</p>
<p>handsome face drawn by Mr. Thacker on this card. But, Gentlemen
</p>
<p>of the Jury, I am sorry to inform the Attorney-General, that the
</p>
<p>Judges of the Queen's Bench are parties to this conspiracy. For if
</p>
<p>you take the trouble of looking up, as you pass through the Hall, you
</p>
<p>may see the bust of Ollam Fodhla gazing on the angry litigants below,
</p>
<p>pointing and directing those who look for justice to the Queen's Bench.
</p>
<p>You may give credit for purity of intention to those who thought that
</p>
<p>Ollam Fodhla ought to be a model of uprightness and purity, but I do not
</p>
<p>see why the members of the Repeal Association are to be held to be
</p>
<p>conspirators, because they have placed his likeness on their card.
</p>
<p>Here is a name which I confess puzzles me a little; and I must cer-
</p>
<p>tainly apply this time to Mr. Justice Burton for assistance. It is the
</p>
<p>next name on the card, Dathi ! Did you ever hear of such a name
</p>
<p>as Dathi? Why, there is conspiracy in the very sound of it. But
</p>
<p>who he was, what were his thoughts and opinions, and how he con-
</p>
<p>ducted himself, whether conformably to law or against the law, I am
</p>
<p>not competent to say ; and I feel, therefore, that my only course is
</p>
<p>to apply to some person acquainted with the antiquities of Ireland to
</p>
<p>throw some light on the matter ; and if there was any thing parti-
</p>
<p>cularly wicked in his conduct, I leave it for the learned Judge to ex-
</p>
<p>plain to you how the people who put his name on this card are con-
</p>
<p>spirators. All I have been able to discover about the gentleman is,
</p>
<p>that he was a Pagan, and Mr. Moore says he was killed at the foot
</p>
<p>of the Alps by a flash of lightning ! But why his name was put on
</p>
<p>this card along with that of Ollam Fodhla, I cannot, discover. The
</p>
<p>learned Attorney-General forgot to prove to you that such persons
</p>
<p>as Dathi or Ollam Fodhla ever lived. But I leave it to you, Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, to judge what the names of these old gentlemen had to do with
</p>
<p>the conspiracy charged against the traversers here, and to determine
</p>
<p>whether they are guilty of a foul conspiracy, because their names ap-
</p>
<p>pear on the card. The learned Judge who is so well versed in the
</p>
<p>antiquities of Ireland, will enlighten you very much on this subject.

</p>
<p>But the traversers went further, and they placed two other names on
</p>
<p>the cards, and what do you imagine they are ? The names of Grat-
</p>
<p>tan and Flood. They had the hardihood to place those names on
</p>
<p>the card ; names which will live and be handed down to posterity as
</p>
<p>long as Ireland lasts. But why will their memory be handed down
</p>
<p>from generation to generation? Is it because by secret treason they
</p>
<p>struck down the Monarchy and abolished the Constitution ? No. But
</p>
<p>as men, to one of whom even the Irish Protestant Parliament voted
</p>
<p>no less than 100,000 for his exertion in the cause of his country ; men
</p>
<p>who, by their persuasive and eloquent tongues, accomplished more
</p>
<p>than ever was accomplished by man ; men to whom the world looks
</p>
<p>back with admiration, and respect, and esteem. And is it come to
</p>
<p>this, that a jury of Irish gentlemen are called on to say that men are
</p>
<p>guilty of a wicked and foul conspiracy, because they put on their
</p>
<p>cards the names  the immortal names  of Grattan and Flood, the
</p>
<p>greatest men their country ever produced, whose lives and principles
</p>
<p>510
</p>
<p>they should endeavour, if not to emulate, at least to follow at an'im-
</p>
<p>measurable distance; I say that if that be the charge, and I say it
</p>
<p>emphatically, the answer to it will be found enshrined in the hearts
</p>
<p>of the Irish people. The next document relied on in the statement of
</p>
<p>the Attorney General, was the Rules to be observed in the Appoint-
</p>
<p>ment of Repeal Wardens; and even if treason existed in the names
</p>
<p>of Ollam Fodhla and of Grattan and Flood, I defy the ingenuity of
</p>
<p>man to discover any thing criminal or bordering on conspiracy in
</p>
<p>this document. Holbrooke, who was employed by the Hoard of
</p>
<p>Works, was the man who was employed in open day to print it.
</p>
<p>There was nothing dark, secret, or hidden about it. All was done
</p>
<p>openly, and in the face of day, and by a man employed by the Go-
</p>
<p>vernment. The first thing to be observed on it is the likeness of the
</p>
<p>Queen sitting on her throne, with the sceptre in her hand and the
</p>
<p>crown on her head, and underneath it the words, God save the Queen.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, if you see any thing wicked, dangerous, or disloyal in
</p>
<p>that, you will find the traversers guilty. I shall hand up the card
</p>
<p>to you, and you will then be able to judge for yourself whether
</p>
<p>there is conspiracy in it or not. On the top of the card is an Irish
</p>
<p>crown and an Irish harp. Immediately below the crown, on the left
</p>
<p>hand side, is a picture of the Giant's Causeway. If you have never
</p>
<p>been at the Giant's Causeway, I would recommend you to go there,
</p>
<p>and you will be able by inspection to judge of the analogy which it bears
</p>
<p>to the conspiracy with which the traversers are charged. But lest you
</p>
<p>should be considered partial, having visited the North, I should recom-
</p>
<p>mend you also to visit Glendalough. Here it is, on the right hand side
</p>
<p>of the card, with its church and round tower. What a serious matter
</p>
<p>this is! The Giant's Causeway on the one hand, and Glendalough on
</p>
<p>the other. Who can deny that it is rank conspiracy ? It was not with
</p>
<p>the Jacobins in France that they were dealing, but with the pictures of
</p>
<p>Glendalough and the Giant's Causeway. Now we come to Achill,
</p>
<p>in the West, and on the other side, by way of showing that they do
</p>
<p>not forget Mr. O'Connell, is a nice picture of" Derrynane Abbey ;"
</p>
<p>there is a quiet little party on the lawn, of which Mr. O'Connell ap-

</p>
<p>pears to be one, then there are the words " Erin go Bragh" a little
</p>
<p>dog, and an old Irish harper, and all appear to be very peaceful ! Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, I hope the day will never come when these allusions to the
</p>
<p>ancient glory and to the national music  the most touching and pa-
</p>
<p>thetic in Europe  will be considered by a jury a proof of conspiracy.
</p>
<p>There was an explanation of the Members' card, written, it is said, by
</p>
<p>a Mr. O'Callaghan. He comments on the resolution adopted by the
</p>
<p>Irish Volunteers in 1782, on certain words used by Mr. Saurin in his
</p>
<p>speech against the Act of Union, and it appears that opinion has
</p>
<p>been justified by what has since taken place, on the words " Catholic,
</p>
<p>Protestant, and Dissenter," placed on the three leaves of the sham-
</p>
<p>rock, with the motto Who shall disunite tis? and then, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>he comes to what the Attorney-General calls the most questionable
</p>
<p>part of the document. Mr. O'Callaghan says that it is not true
</p>
<p>that the Irish always fought badly in their own country, that at Ben-
</p>
<p>burb they gained the victory, where the unfortunate Charles I. was
</p>
<p>backed by the Irish against his rebellious English subjects, who after-
</p>
<p>511
</p>
<p>wards dragged their Sovereign to the block. He then alludes to the
</p>
<p>siege of Limerick. Is it treason or conspiracy to speak of the gallant de-
</p>
<p>fence made there by the Irish ? The treaty still exists which proves
</p>
<p>that gallant defence. They were suffered to march out with their
</p>
<p>arms, the colours, and with all the honours of war. That is an historical
</p>
<p>fact, and it is no crime to allude to it. I therefore submit, Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, to your better judgment, that this card affords no proof of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy with which the traversers are charged by the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I now come to the duties of the Repeal Wardens.
</p>
<p>They are almost a facsimile, a transcript of the rules of the old Ca-
</p>
<p>tholic Association. The first duty of the Repeal Wardens is to di-
</p>
<p>vide the parish or place into districts of convenient size, and each to
</p>
<p>take upon himself the care of one district. The second duty is to
</p>
<p>appoint as many Collectors as he may deem necessary, to act with
</p>
<p>him, and to collect the Repeal fund regularly within his district, from
</p>
<p>each individual willing to contribute a farthing a week, a penny a
</p>
<p>month, or a shilling a year  taking care to make every person favour-
</p>
<p>able to the Repeal understand, that unless he contributes to the
</p>
<p>amount of a shilling a year, his name cannot be enrolled as a Re-
</p>
<p>pealer, and therefore he will be calculated upon by the enemies of
</p>
<p>Ireland as against Repeal. The fifth duty of the Repeal Wardens
</p>
<p>is to transmit to the Secretary of the Repeal Association in Dublin,
</p>
<p>if possible, weekly, and if not weekly, at as short periods as possible,
</p>
<p>the amounts collected, and the names and residences of the contri-
</p>
<p>butors, that they may be enrolled as Associates, as the case may be,
</p>
<p>&c. These rules are taken from the rules of the Catholic Associ-
</p>
<p>ation, and contain instructions to the Repeal Wardens to guard
</p>
<p>against secret societies, and combinations against the law. I will
</p>
<p>particularly call your attention to the eleventh and last duty. " The
</p>
<p>" eleventh and last duty we shall point out to the Repeal Wardens,
</p>
<p>"is one of the greatest possible importance. It is to use all their
</p>
<p>" influence and timely exertion to have all meetings perfectly peace-
</p>
<p>" able, and on all occasions to prevent riot or disorder of any kind.

</p>
<p>" above all things, they should endeavour to detect and bring to
</p>
<p>"justice any wretch wicked enough to venture to administer a se*
</p>
<p>" cret oath. He who would administer a secret oath, would likewise
</p>
<p>" sell his unfortunate victim, the moment after he succeeded in dup-
</p>
<p>" ing him to take it. The Repeal Wardens must also prevent the
</p>
<p>" formation of any secret society whatever." I shall now, Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, call your attention to the resolutions which were passed at a
</p>
<p>meeting, in July, 1843, and to the Address to the Subjects of the
</p>
<p>British Empire, which has been proved in evidence before you.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henri read the documents.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  Gentlemen, I shall next call your attention to
</p>
<p>two documents. The first is a letter which has been already proved
</p>
<p>in the case which is headed " Repeal and Federalism.'' It was
</p>
<p>written by Mr. Sharman Crawford ; and I contend, that the fact
</p>
<p>that a gentleman of Mr. Sharman Crawford's distinction, fortune,
</p>
<p>and position in the country should agree in the opinion of Mr.
</p>
<p>512
</p>
<p>O'Connell, that something like local legislation should be ob-
</p>
<p>tained, is an important fact for my client. In that letter he sets
</p>
<p>forth the grievances under which he says Ireland labours, which
</p>
<p>are in fact the same as those which Mr. O'Connell has spoken
</p>
<p>of, and therefore the substantial disagreement between them
</p>
<p>is only as to the form of the measure, the one advocating fe-
</p>
<p>deralism, the other an independent Parliament. The other docu-
</p>
<p>ment is the Protest of the Irish members. It was signed by 132
</p>
<p>members of Parliament, and was addressed to the English people.
</p>
<p>It sets forth the grievances on account of which Mr. O'Connell says
</p>
<p>he is justified in seeking for a repeal of the Union. The represen-
</p>
<p>tative of Belfast, a wealthy, influential, and important constituency
</p>
<p>signed it, and his opinions have not been disavowed, or disclaimed by
</p>
<p>his constituency. It was also signed by Mr. William Smith O'Brien, a
</p>
<p>distinguished member of Parliament for thirteen years, the son of
</p>
<p>a baronet, a Protestant, who addressed another letter to the Repeal
</p>
<p>Association, in which he stated that he had been forced to come
</p>
<p>to the conclusion, that a separate legislature only would ameliorate
</p>
<p>the condition of Ireland. It is, therefore, impossible to say that it
</p>
<p>was sedition in Mr. O'Connell to hold the same opinion with the
</p>
<p>wisest, the most just, and the most respectable individuals in the
</p>
<p>country. In Hardy's case, 24 St. Tr. 211, Mr. Erskine says: " The
</p>
<p>" first observation I shall make to you is, that every act done by the
</p>
<p>" prisoners, every sentence written by them, in the remotest degree
</p>
<p>" connected with the charge, or offered in evidence to support it, were
</p>
<p>" done and written in the public face of the world ; the transactions
</p>
<p>" which constitute the whole body of proof, were not those of a day,
</p>
<p>" but in regular series for two years together ; they are not the pecu-
</p>
<p>" liar transactions of the prisoners, but of immense bodies of the
</p>
<p>" King's subjects, in various parts of the kingdom assembled without
</p>
<p>" the smallest reserve, and giving to the public through the channel
</p>
<p>" of the daily newspapers a minute and regular journal of their whole
</p>
<p>" proceedings." So it was with Mr. O'Connell, even at the com-
</p>
<p>mencement of his public life. In January, 1800, he made a speech
</p>

</p>
<p>at the Royal Exchange, he made that speech publicly, under the sur-
</p>
<p>veillance of Major Sirr, a gentleman of considerable police talents.
</p>
<p>He who is now charged with conspiracy, then made his first speech
</p>
<p>against the Union. Forty-four years ago, at a public meeting, he
</p>
<p>broached sentiments for which he is indicted for a conspiracy to-day.
</p>
<p>In 1810 he broached the same opinions, in the speeches read to you
</p>
<p>by Mr. She'd.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, the Attorney- General referred you to
</p>
<p>the report of the Secret Committee of the House of Commons in
</p>
<p>1797, and he endeavoured to draw an analogy between the proceed-
</p>
<p>ings of this Association, and the proceedings of the United Irishmen
</p>
<p>at that time. But he kept back from you the fact that the United
</p>
<p>Irishmen first sprang up in Belfast, among men who hold different
</p>
<p>opinions on every political subject from the men who are charged
</p>
<p>with this conspiracy  among the Protestants and Presbyterians of
</p>
<p>the North of Ireland. I will read to you some passages which will
</p>
<p>513
</p>
<p>prove how different the constitution of that society was from that of
</p>
<p>the Repeal Association. How different were their rules and their
</p>
<p>principles of action. In page 67 of the Report, you will find a paper
</p>
<p>containing the original design of the Society of the United Irishmen,
</p>
<p>and I will call your attention to some passages in it : " Is there any
</p>
<p>" middle state between the extremes of union with Britain, and
</p>
<p>" total separation in which which the rights of the people can
</p>
<p>" be fully established and rest in security." " Let the Society at
</p>
<p>" large meet four times in the year, and an acting committee once
</p>
<p>" a month, to which all members shall be invited." " Let these
</p>
<p>" meetings be convivial, but not the transitory patriotism of deep
</p>
<p>"potations, confidential, the heart open and the door locked ;" that is
</p>
<p>very like the Repeal Association ; "conversational, not a debating
</p>
<p>society." In page 67: "Secrecy is expedient and necessary; it
</p>
<p>" will make the bond of union more cohesive, and the spirit of this
</p>
<p>" union more ardent and more condensed. ... It will throw a veil
</p>
<p>" over those individuals whose professional prudence might make
</p>
<p>" them wish to be concealed until a manifestation of themselves be-
</p>
<p>" comes actually necessary." In page 54: " It appears from a variety
</p>
<p>" of evidence that no means are neglected for establishing their con-
</p>
<p>" stitution, and enforcing an obedience to their laws ; that contribu-
</p>
<p>" tions are levied to defray the expenses of the Society, that threats
</p>
<p>" and intimidation are employed as a means to prevent their associates
</p>
<p>" from being brought to justice, and that a committee is appointed to
</p>
<p>" defray the expenses of defending such as are brought to trial, or are in
</p>
<p>" prison ; that the assistance of the French is expected and held forth as
</p>
<p>" negotiated for." In page 41 of the Appendix, No. 2, is this :
</p>
<p>" Over the seat of the president of each meeting of this society, shall
</p>
<p>" be suspended, a label, with these words: Beware of Orators."
</p>
<p>A very unsuitable motto, certainly for the Repeal Association. I
</p>
<p>venture to say, that no man will accuse Mr. O'Connell of fixing up
</p>
<p>that motto in the Repeal Association Rooms. I am surprised the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General should have referred to this book, proving, as it
</p>
<p>does, that the United Irishmen looked to French sympathy for as-

</p>
<p>sistance. What is the evidence on that subject in this case ? Mr.
</p>
<p>Jackson, that respectable gentleman who dealt in thunderbolts, who
</p>
<p>wrote the embellished reports of the Kilrush petty sessions, who
</p>
<p>sent off to the Morning Herald, slips of paper, which he had pro-
</p>
<p>cured from any person who was charitable enough to give them to
</p>
<p>him, who wrote stories which any person might believe, who was
</p>
<p>foolish enough to do so. That respectable gentleman told you that
</p>
<p>he heard Mr. O'Connell abuse Louis Philippe, and scoff at the
</p>
<p>French Constitution ; ridicule the Government, and warn the
</p>
<p>people against every thing French. If he had been engaged in
</p>
<p>a secret, dark, deep conspiracy, such as that in which Wolfe Tone
</p>
<p>and the United Irishmen were engaged, would he not, like them,
</p>
<p>have sought to conciliate the French nation ? Mr. O'Connell's
</p>
<p>observations tend to produce a contrary effect, for he abused
</p>
<p>the House of Peers, called the King an usurper, and went so far as
</p>
<p>to say that the Irish people would assist the lawful monarch in re-
</p>
<p>3u
</p>
<p>514
</p>
<p>covering the throne. That was the worst way in the world of gaining
</p>
<p>the good feeling of the French people, for they are fond of revolu-
</p>
<p>tions, and they get up one every ten years, just for diversion. Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, I submit therefore on the whole of this part of the case, that
</p>
<p>it is impossible  looking at the publicity of these proceedings, the
</p>
<p>time these opinions were first adopted, the motives which led the people
</p>
<p>to adopt them, the consistency with which they adhered to them 
</p>
<p>it is impossible, from any one thing which has been adopted, and, as
</p>
<p>Lord Erskine said, printed and given to the world for the last twelve
</p>
<p>months, to come to the conclusion that these people were banded
</p>
<p>together in a wicked and abominable conspiracy, to accomplish uni-
</p>
<p>versal desolation  it is impossible to come to the conclusion that
</p>
<p>there was a common preconcerted plan to carry their object into
</p>
<p>effect by the wicked means specified in the indictment.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, the Attorney-General deprecated this
</p>
<p>agitation on the question of the Repeal of the Union. He told
</p>
<p>you that at the time of the Union there was a fixed settle-
</p>
<p>ment of the constitutional relations of the two countries. Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen of the Jury, the Irish people, or a large mass of them, are
</p>
<p>of opinion that they labour under grievances; that there are rea-
</p>
<p>sons why they should seek for a Repeal of the Union, and that you
</p>
<p>are not to condemn them on that ground. The universal people of
</p>
<p>Ireland look to the composition of the Government. They see it
</p>
<p>composed, as I shall say, of honourable, and enlightened, and excel-
</p>
<p>lent men ; but they see amongst that Government no one man con-
</p>
<p>nected with Ireland, to represent their wants, their wishes, and their
</p>
<p>grievances. Of self-legislation they are deprived ; of self-govern-
</p>
<p>ment it would seem they are incompetent. It is a matter no less
</p>
<p>of surprise than of concern, that the country which produced a
</p>
<p>Burke, the teacher of statesmen, the saviour of states, cannot now fur-
</p>
<p>nish a single individual qualified to share in the administration of the
</p>
<p>affairs of his native country. You may say, Gentlemen, and say with
</p>
<p>truth, that it is a matter of small moment who the individuals may
</p>
<p>be who compose the Ministry of the day, provided the people

</p>
<p>are prosperous, contented, and happy. But are the people of
</p>
<p>Ireland contented, prosperous, and happy ? Alas ! a large por-
</p>
<p>tion of our countrymen are unhappy, discontented, destitute.
</p>
<p>They look around for the cause of their misfortunes ; they behold a
</p>
<p>country blessed by Providence with the means of wealth. The strong
</p>
<p>man pines for the daily wages of a sixpence ; he strives with gaunt
</p>
<p>famine in the midst of fields teeming with fertility and plenty. Is he
</p>
<p>seditious, if he exclaims in the language of indignant remonstrance,
</p>
<p>that he thinks a native Parliament would give him the means of sub-
</p>
<p>sistence ? Is it criminal for him to wish for the means of life ? Is he
</p>
<p>seditious if, knowing that his single voice would be unheeded as the
</p>
<p>idle wind, he joins with other men in a declaration of their common
</p>
<p>wants, their common grievances, and their common sufferings ? Is
</p>
<p>he, or are they, conspirators, if they think a local Parliament might,
</p>
<p>perhaps, give them those blessings for which they sigh ? They think,
</p>
<p>perhaps erroneously, that a resident aristocracy, and a resident
</p>
<p>515
</p>
<p>gentry would prove the source of industry, and the means of
</p>
<p>wealth. They see their aristocracy absentees  the mischief daily
</p>
<p>and hourly increasing. They think, perchance, a native Parliament
</p>
<p>might induce them to return. Are they conspirators because they
</p>
<p>say so ? They know, and true it is, that the beauties of Ireland,
</p>
<p>if now she has any, are not sufficient to induce her nobility or her
</p>
<p>gentry to return. What are her rare beauties compared with the
</p>
<p>fascinations of the Imperial Senate, or the glittering splendour of a
</p>
<p>Court? They see and they believe that wealth is hourly diminishing
</p>
<p>in the country. Before them they think there is a gloomy prospect
</p>
<p>and little hope. They look to this metropolis ; they see what a quick
</p>
<p>and sensitive people cannot shut their eyes to  the houses of their
</p>
<p>nobility converted into boarding-houses or barracks ; their Stamp
</p>
<p>Office abolished; their Linen Hall waste ; their Exchange silent;
</p>
<p>their University deserted ; their Custom House almost a Poor House;
</p>
<p>and, not long since, they read a debate, got up by the economists, as
</p>
<p>to the prudence of removing the broken-down Irish pensioners from
</p>
<p>Kilmainham to Chelsea, to effect a little saving, careless of the feel-
</p>
<p>ings, the associations, the joys, or the grief of the poor old Irish
</p>
<p>soldiers, who had bravely served their country. That cruelty was
</p>
<p>prevented by an exhibition of national spirit and national indignation.
</p>
<p>They see daily the expenditure of every shilling is withdrawn from
</p>
<p>the poorer to the richer country, on the ground of the application of
</p>
<p>the hard rules of political economy, or the unbending principles of
</p>
<p>Imperial centralization. They behold their Parliament House  the
</p>
<p>Union has improved it into a Bank. That magnificent structure,
</p>
<p>within whose walls the voice of eloquence was heard, stands a
</p>
<p>monument of past glory and present degradation. The glorious
</p>
<p>labours of our gifted countrymen within those walls are not forgotten.
</p>
<p>The works of the understanding do not quickly perish. The verses
</p>
<p>of Homer have lived for twenty-five hundred years, without the loss
</p>
<p>of a syllable or a letter, while cities, and temples, and palaces have
</p>
<p>fallen. The eloquence of Greece tells us of the genius of her sons
</p>
<p>and of the freedom which produced it. We forget her ruin in the

</p>
<p>recollection of her greatness ; nor can we read even now without
</p>
<p>emotion the exalted sentiments of her inspired sons, poured forth in
</p>
<p>exquisite language, to save the expiring liberties of their country.
</p>
<p>Perhaps their genius had a resurrectionary power, and in later days
</p>
<p>quickened a degenerate posterity from the lethargy of slavery to the
</p>
<p>activity of freedom. We, too, in brighter times have had amongst
</p>
<p>us men who approached the greatness of antiquity. The imperish-
</p>
<p>able records of their eloquence may keep alive in our hearts a zeal
</p>
<p>for freedom and a love of country. The comprehensive genius of
</p>
<p>Flood, the more than mortal energy of Grattan, the splendour of
</p>
<p>Bushe, the wisdom of Saurin, the learning of Ball, the noble
</p>
<p>simplicity of Burrowes, the Demosthenic fire of Plunket, the elo-
</p>
<p>quence of Curran rushing from the heart, which will sound in
</p>
<p>the ears of his countrymen for ever. They failed to save the ancient
</p>
<p>Constitution of Ireland; wit, learning, eloquence, genius, lost their
</p>
<p>516
</p>
<p>power over the souls of men. With one great exception these, our
</p>
<p>distinguished countrymen, have passed away; but their memories
</p>
<p>cannot perish with them ; while the language lasts their eloquence
</p>
<p>lives, and their names will be remembered by a grateful posterity
</p>
<p>while genius is honoured and patriotism revered. Lastly, on the sub-
</p>
<p>ject of the Union. The Irish people say the Imperial Parliament has
</p>
<p>not attended to their peculiar wants, nor redressed their peculiar griev-
</p>
<p>ances. " Ourcharacter," 6ay they, " has been misunderstood, and some-
</p>
<p>" times slandered ; our faults have been magnified into vices ; and the
</p>
<p>" crimes of a few have been visited on the nation." The Irish  the
</p>
<p>mere Irish  have been derided as creatures of impulse without settled
</p>
<p>understandings, or reasoning powers, or moral sense. They have
</p>
<p>their faults, I grieve to say it ; but their faults are redeemed by splen-
</p>
<p>did virtues  their sympathies are warm, their affections are generous,
</p>
<p>their hearts are brave. They have rushed into this agitation with
</p>
<p>ardour, because it is their nature when they feel strongly to act boldly,
</p>
<p>and to speak passionately. Ascribe their excesses to their enthusi-
</p>
<p>asm, and forgive. Recollect that the same enthusiasm has borne them
</p>
<p>triumphant over fields of peril and glory  impelled them to shed
</p>
<p>their dearest blood, and spend their gallant lives in defence of the li-
</p>
<p>berties of England. The broken chivalry of France attests the value
</p>
<p>of their fiery enthusiasm, andmarks its power. Nor is their high
</p>
<p>spirit useful only in the storm of battle ; it cheers their almost broken
</p>
<p>hearts  lightens their load of misery, well nigh unsupportable 
</p>
<p>sweetens that bitter cup of poverty which thousands of your country-
</p>
<p>men are doomed to drink. What is there truly great which enthu-
</p>
<p>siasm has not won for man ? The glorious works of art, the immor-
</p>
<p>tal productions of the understanding, the incredible labours of heroes
</p>
<p>and patriots for the liberties of mankind, have been promoted by en-
</p>
<p>thusiasm, and by little else. Cold and dull were our existence here
</p>
<p>below, unless the deep passions of the soul, stirred by enthusiasm,
</p>
<p>were sometimes summoned into action for great and noble purposes 
</p>
<p>the overwhelming of vice, wickedness, and tyranny ; the securing
</p>
<p>and spreading of the world's virtue, the world's happiness, the world's

<p>freedom. The hand of Omnipotence, by whose touch this island

<p>started into existence amidst the waters which surround it, stamped

</p>
<p>FRIDAY, February 2.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside.
</p>
<p>My Lords, and Gentlemen of the Jury,
</p>
<p>I shall now draw your attention to the charge in the indictment,
</p>
<p>on the subject of the Arbitration Courts. That charge is, that the
</p>
<p>traversers conspired to bring into hatred and disrepute the Courts
</p>
<p>517
</p>
<p>by law established in Ireland for the administration of justice, and to
</p>
<p>diminish the confidence of her said Majesty's liege subjects in Ireland
</p>
<p>in the administration of the law therein, with the intent to induce Her
</p>
<p>Majesty's subjects to withdraw the adjudication of their differences
</p>
<p>with and claims from the cognizance of the said Courts by law
</p>
<p>established, and to submit the same to the judgment and deter-
</p>
<p>mination of other tribunals, to be constituted and contrived for that
</p>
<p>purpose. This single accusation is spread over a great portion of the
</p>
<p>indictment, and was much dwelt upon by the Attorney-General in his
</p>
<p>address to you. I apprehend, it would astonish you much if a prose-
</p>
<p>cution was instituted against one of you on the ground that you re-
</p>
<p>commended one of your brother jurors not to go to law. With a view
</p>
<p>to ascertain whether the act done is legal, you must consider what
</p>
<p>was done, or advised to be done, and whether the means resorted to
</p>
<p>for carrying the object into effect were legal. I submit to you tbat it
</p>
<p>is both a religious and a moral duty, if possible, to compromise litiga-
</p>
<p>tion. " Now, therefore, there is utterly a fault among you, because
</p>
<p>" ye go to law one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong ?
</p>
<p>" Why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded ?" 1 Cor.
</p>
<p>cap. 6, v. 7. Therefore, it is plain, that to compromise the subject
</p>
<p>matter of difference between neighbours, if you can, is a religious
</p>
<p>duty. Next, I submit it is a moral duty. Paley, in his Moral Phi-
</p>
<p>losophy, p. 141, says on this subject of litigation : " But since it is
</p>
<p>" supposed to be undertaken simply with a view to the ends of justice
</p>
<p>" and safety, the prosecutor of the action is bound to confine himself
</p>
<p>" to the cheapest process that will accomplish these ends, as well as
</p>
<p>" to consent to any peaceable expedient for the same purpose. As to
</p>
<p>" a reference, in which the arbitrators can do what the law cannot,
</p>
<p>" divide the damage when the fault is mutual ; or to a compounding
</p>
<p>" of the dispute, by accepting a compensation in the gross, with-
</p>
<p>" out entering into articles and items, which is often very diffi-
</p>
<p>" cult to adjust separately." Therefore, Gentlemen, the thing
</p>
<p>done is both a religious and a moral duty. The law itself re-
</p>
<p>spects arbitration, and encourages it by every means ; and it has

</p>
<p>occurred frequently in our experience, that while a suit was pend-
</p>
<p>ing, and had been brought at great expense before a Judge
</p>
<p>and Jury, it has been suggested by counsel or by the Court that a
</p>
<p>submission to arbitration should be adopted, and that it should be
</p>
<p>referred by consent to one or two discreet and sensible men to adju-
</p>
<p>dicate on the matter in dispute. The Statute law of the land recoc-
</p>
<p>nizes arbitration. By the 1 Will. III. c. 14, it is provided, " that mer-
</p>
<p>" chants, traders, and others may agree that their submission of acon-
</p>
<p>" troversy (for which no remedy exists but by personal action or suit
</p>
<p>" in equity) to award or umpirage, be made a rule of Court of record,
</p>
<p>" and insert the agreement in their submission." There are two later
</p>
<p>Statutes also on the same subject. The 3 & 4 Vic. c. 105, s. 63,
</p>
<p>recites, that " whereas it is expedient to render references to ar-
</p>
<p>bitration more effectual, enacts, &c." There are also other provi-
</p>
<p>sions to facilitate submission to arbitration, and to compel the atten-
</p>
<p>518
</p>
<p>dance of witnesses. By the 5 & 6 Will. IV. c. 64, and the 5 & 6
</p>
<p>Vic. c. 82, arbitration is also recognized ; and by the latter Statute,
</p>
<p>where the matter in dispute is under 20, the arbitration awards are
</p>
<p>made free from stamp duty. Gentlemen, the Statute law, where it doe3
</p>
<p>not make any positive enactment on the subject, recommends arbi-
</p>
<p>tration. There are Statutes relating to Friendly Societies. The
</p>
<p>10 Geo. IV. c. 56, s. 27, makes provision for referring their dis-
</p>
<p>putes to arbitration. My Lords, the case of Waters v. Taylor, 15
</p>
<p>Vesey, 17, shows that Courts of Equity give encouragement to arbi-
</p>
<p>tration. Lord Eldon says: " The argument with reference to these
</p>
<p>" provisions [provisions in reference to arbitration] is, that the Court
</p>
<p>" can no more renounce the jurisdiction on account of the ridiculous
</p>
<p>" or frivolous nature of the dispute, than upon the most important
</p>
<p>" point; but my argument is, that the Forum they have provided for
</p>
<p>" themselves, and the guard, introduced by them against the Forum
</p>
<p>" of the country, shows their intention against the interference of
</p>
<p>" any otherjurisdiction until they have tried the effect of the spe-
</p>
<p>*' cial means provided by themselves." In O'Keeffe v. O'Connell,
</p>
<p>1 Fox & Sm. 69, the late Chief Justice Bushe says : " And the re-
</p>
<p>" fore all that remains to be considered is, whether the construction
</p>
<p>" of the Statute is such that no award can be executed without pre-
</p>
<p>" viously making the submission a rule of Court. The preamble of
</p>
<p>" the Statute goes far to show that such is not the true construction
</p>
<p>" of the Act, for it recites the object of it to be, to give to the party
</p>
<p>" getting the award the power of enforcing it by the summary order
</p>
<p>" of that Court, of which the submission is made a rule. It does not
</p>
<p>" affect to give a jurisdiction to the arbitrator through the authority
</p>
<p>M of the Court. His authority and jurisdiction flow not from the
</p>
<p>" Court, but from the deed of submission executed by the parties,
</p>
<p>" and the Court is merely resorted to by means of the Statute, as
</p>
<p>" affording a summary sanction by treating as a contempt the diso-
</p>
<p>" bedience of the award when made." Now, Gentlemen, apply this
</p>
<p>to the evidence which the policeman Hovenden gave before you.
</p>
<p>Therefore, Gentlemen of the Jury, applying the doctrine to which I

</p>
<p>have taken the liberty of referring the Court, it is quite plain that
</p>
<p>the Arbitrators did not act until they had obtained the consent of the
</p>
<p>parties. To advise men not to go to law is not a crime ; it is a moral
</p>
<p>duty ; and if several agree in the recommendation to perform a moral
</p>
<p>duty, it cannot be a conspiracy. The thing to be done, therefore,
</p>
<p>is not illegal ; and then the question is, whether the means by
</p>
<p>which it was sought to be done were illegal. Four or five do-
</p>
<p>cuments were read by the Attorney-General, but they proved
</p>
<p>nothing. One of them was a summons served by one party on
</p>
<p>another. Gentlemen, I tell you that if a matter was referred to
</p>
<p>two jurors in that box, you must give, and it is usual to give and sign
</p>
<p>some form of notice, apprising the parties to come before you on a
</p>
<p>particular day, in order to enter on the particular subject of reference.
</p>
<p>As to the other document, the Form of Award, it proves nothing
</p>
<p>but how a proper award may be made. If the subject matter of
</p>
<p>519
</p>
<p>arbitration be 20 or upwards, the award must be stamped, to guard
</p>
<p>the parties against committing an illegal act. The Form of Award
</p>
<p>only shows that where the parties chose to consent to refer the sub-
</p>
<p>ject matter of dispute, here is the form by which that consent may
</p>
<p>be carried into execution ; and the directions which have been read
</p>
<p>declare positively that the Arbitrators are to take notice that they
</p>
<p>have no power, authority, or jurisdiction, except by the consent of
</p>
<p>such parties as may come before them. That was the last rule
</p>
<p>adopted by the Association, and the proposition made by Dr. Gray,
</p>
<p>that any person who would not abide the award of the Arbitrators
</p>
<p>should be expelled the Repeal Association, was rejected, and never
</p>
<p>acted on and never adopted, and the only rules resolved on were
</p>
<p>those which have been read in evidence, and in which no such
</p>
<p>penalty is contained. There is, therefore, nothing more in this part
</p>
<p>of the case than a recommendation to the parties to submit to arbi-
</p>
<p>tration. That consent is the root of all the references to arbitration,
</p>
<p>and the thing to be done being moral and proper, and the means
</p>
<p>being legal, I submit that this novel, unheard-of, unprecedented,
</p>
<p>extraordinary, extravagant ground of accusation cannot be relied on
</p>
<p>in the present case. It is said " you did more; you not only induced
</p>
<p>" parties to refer suits to arbitration, but that those justices that had
</p>
<p>" been dismissed should be selected as Arbitrators." That has been
</p>
<p>most strongly pressed by the Attorney-General, and has been over
</p>
<p>and over again urged. I admit frankly that it was said by Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell and others, that they hoped that those persons being
</p>
<p>dismissed justices, residing in some parts of the country, should be
</p>
<p>selected or appointed to act on behalf of the people ; and they hoped
</p>
<p>the time would come when the people would be at liberty to elect
</p>
<p>their own magistrates. It arose from matters merely accidental, and
</p>
<p>never was intended or contemplated by those who became Repealers. It
</p>
<p>was long afterwards that the act was done which led to the appointment
</p>
<p>of these ex-justices as Arbitrators, and it was not the result of a com-
</p>
<p>mon design. It was suggested by the act of the Government. They
</p>
<p>saw that a number of gentlemen of high respectability, attended those

</p>
<p>Repeal meetings, and it is quite plain, from reading the first letter
</p>
<p>of the Lord Chancellor, that he did not consider they had thereby
</p>
<p>done an illegal act. In his letter of the 28th of May, 1843, he says:
</p>
<p>" That it had been his earnest determination not to interfere
</p>
<p>" with expression of opinion, by any magistrate, in respect to the
</p>
<p>" Repeal of the Union, although from his arrival in this country, he
</p>
<p>" felt it to be inconsistent with his duty to appoint to the Commis-
</p>
<p>" sion of the Peace, any one who was pledged to the support of that
</p>
<p>" measure ; but he afterwards assigns as his reason for dismissing
</p>
<p>" them, that after the discussion in the House of the Lords, and the
</p>
<p>" declaration made in Parliament by Sir Robert Peel, in answer to the
</p>
<p>" plain and distinct question of Lord Jocelyn, he felt it his duty to ask
</p>
<p>" whether they intended to attend any more of those meetings, and if
</p>
<p>" so to dismiss them." That letter plainly showed that the Lord
</p>
<p>Chancellor thought that attending those meetings originally was not an
</p>
<p>illegal act, and was then merely a warning. Gentlemen, it is not my
</p>
<p>duty, if I thought it consistent with the high respect I entertain for
</p>
<p>520
</p>
<p>that distinguished person, to enter on a discussion of the grounds on
</p>
<p>which he proceeded; but there were men of high authority expressed
</p>
<p>their opinions on it, and among others, two who had filled the otfice
</p>
<p>of Lord Chancellor of England. I mean Lord Cottenham and Lord
</p>
<p>Campbell, who, in the House of Lords, disputed those grounds, and
</p>
<p>said very plainly that it was unconstitutional to dismiss those magis-
</p>
<p>trates. That a justice of the peace had the same right to express,
</p>
<p>" and entertain his opinion, as any other man in the community, and
</p>
<p>" that for having so done, it was illegal and unconstitutional to dis-
</p>
<p>" miss them." When the members of the Repeal Association saw
</p>
<p>that such high legal authorities entertained that opinion, in reference
</p>
<p>to the dismissal of those magistrates, and considered that the decla-
</p>
<p>ration against Repeal, on which their dismissal was based, did not
</p>
<p>come directly from Her Majesty, or in any constitutional shape
</p>
<p>upon her authority  and it is not for me to say who was right,
</p>
<p>or who was wrong  seeing that these gentlemen possessed the
</p>
<p>confidence of the people, that the people were piqued at their
</p>
<p>dismissal, they did recommend their appointment as arbitrators,
</p>
<p>and in the words of Mr. O'Connell, " recommended that all mi-
</p>
<p>" serable petty sessions litigation should be put an end to,
</p>
<p>" and that all disputes arising in those districts where the magis-
</p>
<p>" trates had been dismissed should be referred to them as Arbi-
</p>
<p>" trators, and that he hoped the day would come when he would
</p>
<p>" see the magistrates appointed by the people." Gentlemen, I de-
</p>
<p>fend that assertion of Mr. O'Connell. He had a right to make that
</p>
<p>observation. I have yet to learn from the Solicitor-General that it is
</p>
<p>illegal to express a wish to walk in the ancient footsteps of the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution, and that a desire to return to the ancient state of the wise
</p>
<p>administration of justice is a conspiracy. The more we investigate
</p>
<p>the old rules of the common law of England, the more deep is our
</p>
<p>respect for, and attachment to them. They were based on the sound-
</p>
<p>est principles of constitutional freedom, and they only serve to show
</p>
<p>how strong should be our attachment to those principles which
</p>

<p>ancient title of a justice of the peace, or magistrate, was, " conser-
</p>
<p>vator of the peace." In the 2 Inst., 558, Lord Coke says: "These
</p>
<p>" conservators, by the ancient common law, were, by force of
</p>
<p>" the King's writ, chosen in full and open county, de probioribus
</p>
<p>" et potentioribus comitatm, by the freeholders of the county,
</p>
<p>" after which election, so made and returned, then in that case
</p>
<p>" the King directed a writ to the party so elected." And, Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, on this subject, there is a great deal of instructive learning in
</p>
<p>the able and learned argument of one of the learned Judges now
</p>
<p>upon the Bench, Mr. Justice Perrin, in the case of Taafe v. Dowries,
</p>
<p>which shows the origin of the appointment of those justices to
</p>
<p>which I adverted. The sheriffs were originally appointed by the
</p>
<p>people, and for this reason, that they had the appointment of the
</p>
<p>juries. The law did not give the appointment of the sheriffs to the
</p>
<p>Crown, because if a cause arose between the Crown and the sub-
</p>
<p>ject, he might return an unfair jury. The sheriffs were elected by
</p>
<p>the people for the same reason, as Lord Coke says : " because their
</p>
<p>521
</p>
<p>" office concerned the administration of justice, in which all were con-
</p>
<p>" cerned." The coroner, for the same reason, was appointed by the
</p>
<p>people, and he alone, as in ancient times, is now elected by the peo-
</p>
<p>ple, as were the sheriffs and justices of the peace. The appointment
</p>
<p>of sheriffs is now vested in the worthiest hands in which it could be
</p>
<p>placed. The Judges select three gentlemen of the county whom they
</p>
<p>think most fit, and the Crown is bound to select a sheriff from the
</p>
<p>persons returned by the Judges. I, therefore, say it is no crime to
</p>
<p>wish the justices of the peace to be appointed by the people. If you
</p>
<p>wish to know how the people lost their right of appointing those offi-
</p>
<p>cers you shall hear, in the language of one of the most eminent legal
</p>
<p>authorities that you can be referred to. I quote from 1 Blackstone's
</p>
<p>Comm., 347. " But when Queen Isabel, wife of Edward II., had
</p>
<p>* contrived to depose her husband, by a forced resignation of the
</p>
<p>" crown, and had set up her son, Edward III., in his place, this being
</p>
<p>" a thing then without example in England, it was feared would much
</p>
<p>" alarm the people, especially as the old King was living, though hur-
</p>
<p>" ried about from castle to castle, till at last he met with an untimely
</p>
<p>" death. To prevent, therefore, any risings or other disturbances of the
</p>
<p>" peace, the new King sent writs to all the sheriffs in England, giving
</p>
<p>" a plausible account of the manner of his obtaining the crown, and
</p>
<p>" withal commanding each sheriff that the peace be kept through his
</p>
<p>** bailiwick, on pain and peril of disinheritance, and loss of life and limb,
</p>
<p>" and in a few weeks afterwards it was ordained in Parliament that
</p>
<p>" good men and lawful should be assigned to keep the peace. And
</p>
<p>" in this manner, and upon this occasion, was the election of the con-
</p>
<p>" servators of the peace taken from the people and given to the
</p>
<p>" King." Gentlemen, the arbitration rested on the consent of the
</p>
<p>parties. I have but one remark more to make, and that is, that
</p>
<p>before you hold anything to be criminal, merely because it is novel,
</p>
<p>you will ask, and require from the Crown counsel to show you
</p>
<p>some plain, clear expression, in a book of law, constituting the
</p>
<p>criminality of thatact.
</p>
<p>Another short topic was adverted to by my learned friend the

<p>Attorney General  the observations made by Mr. O'Connell on the
</p>
<p>Queen's Speech ; and I shall now ask you to attend to what I sug-
</p>
<p>gest in regard to it. It may have occurred that unseemly language
</p>
<p>was used in relation to that document, but I beg of you to bear in
</p>
<p>mind, the distinction which was always made by Mr. O'Connell, that
</p>
<p>it was not the act of Her Majesty, but that of her Ministers. He
</p>
<p>had a right to comment on it. Our gracious Sovereign is not re-
</p>
<p>sponsible for any word in that speech. The Whig Ministry prepare
</p>
<p>a Whig speech, and the Tory Ministry a Tory speech. The Whig Mi-
</p>
<p>nistry censure the Tory speech, and the Tory Ministry censure the
</p>
<p>Whig speech ; and I believe it is not within the compass of human
</p>
<p>possibility to frame a speech so as to please all parties. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>I shall refer you to two authorities, which I hope the Attorney Ge-
</p>
<p>neral will not censure me for quoting. You may wish to know in
</p>
<p>what terms two stout Conservative papers treated the speech of Her
</p>
<p>Majesty, in July, 1839, on the Education question. I quote from
</p>
<p>3x
</p>
<p>522
</p>
<p>the London Standard, and what is its language ? " The answer in-
</p>
<p>" suiting to the majority of the House of Lords, the half of the
</p>
<p>" House of Commons, and the whole people ; an answer not to be
</p>
<p>" surpassed in petulance and insolent hypocrisy, by any thing that
</p>
<p>" has proceeded from the Throne since the expulsion of the Stuarts,
</p>
<p>" is thus, by the vile artifice of Lord Melbourne, brought home to
</p>
<p>" the Queen personally. Is this the way to insure Her Majesty the
</p>
<p>" affection and respect of her people ? Will they love her more for
</p>
<p>" preferring the interest of Lord Melbourne to their wishes? Will
</p>
<p>" they respect more a Princess of twenty years and two months, be-
</p>
<p>" cause she is represented as rebuking sharply the majority of the
</p>
<p>" Lords, the great majority of British Members of the House of
</p>
<p>" Commons, the Nation and the Church, and associating with that
</p>
<p>" rebuke a claim of confidence in her attachment to the interest of
</p>
<p>" the Church, almost in the words of the Popish tyrant, James II. ?
</p>
<p>" Has the Queen no friend to set the truth of these matters before
</p>
<p>" her Majesty ? Alas, we fear she has none ! An execrable foreign
</p>
<p>" influence interposes between Her Majesty, and her truest and best
</p>
<p>" friend, that friend whom nature and experience call upon her to
</p>
<p>" trust before all others. We know not what the House of Lords
</p>
<p>" may think it right to do on this answer. We hope, however,
</p>
<p>" that an acknowledgment will be extorted from Lord Melbourne
</p>
<p>" that the answer is his, and not the Queen's, in any but the merely
</p>
<p>" formal sense. This is absolutely necessary in justice to Her Ma-
</p>
<p>" jesty." So much for the Standard. And now, Gentlemen, let
</p>
<p>me call your attention to the mild and gentle strictures which ap-
</p>
<p>peared in another journal of similar politics, the Morning Post, with
</p>
<p>respect to that speech. I confine myself to a reference to those news-
</p>
<p>papers, for I am well aware that they are likely to find favour from the
</p>
<p>counsel for the Crown, and I think it utterly impossible that journals
</p>
<p>whose opinions are so sound and orthodox, should commit any error
</p>
<p>on the subject of the right of the public to express their opinion of the
</p>
<p>speech of the Sovereign, which is put into her mouth by the Minister.
</p>
<p>Hear, now, the Morning Post : " We are of opinion that it is im-

<p>" possible to conceive anything more grosely ungenerous, anything
</p>
<p>" more unmanly and base than the conduct of the present Mi-
</p>
<p>" nistry to their Sovereign ; look at the answer to the Address of
</p>
<p>" the House of Lords, which these Ministers have presumed to put
</p>
<p>" into the mouth of Her Majesty. Was ever Sovereign so misguided
</p>
<p>" and degraded before, except in the unhappy period, when rude
</p>
<p>" rebellion has lorded it ever legitimate monarchy ? Most sincerely
</p>
<p>" do we pity the Monarch who is made the victim of an administra-
</p>
<p>" tion at once so daring and so contemptible. We know not how
</p>
<p>" long this is to be borne ; we think it has been borne too long
</p>
<p>" already. We call on every man who thinks the religion of the
</p>
<p>" people, and the safety, honour, and dignity of the Crown, matter of
</p>
<p>" importance, to make a personal stand against the vileness which ap-
</p>
<p>" pears to infect high places. We know what the present adminis-
</p>
<p>" tration has given us, it has given us a frivolous, scandalous, and
</p>
<p>" futile Court, a dishonest and despised Government, a wronged,
</p>
<p>523
</p>
<p>" insulted, and indignant people. We trust that the day may yet
</p>
<p>" be when all this will be reckoned up, and when justice will be done
</p>
<p>" to the guilty," which, being interpreted, means, when the Whigs go
</p>
<p>out and the Tories come in. Now, Gentlemen, I implore you to
</p>
<p>keep that passage in mind when the Solicitor-General comes to speak
</p>
<p>of this part of the case. Remember how the Tories speak of the
</p>
<p>Whig speech, and how the Whigs speak of the Tory speech, and
</p>
<p>then consider whether you can deny to Mr. O'Connell, who does not
</p>
<p>care a bean-blossom for Whig or Tory, the right of abusing the
</p>
<p>speech of any Ministry who may be in power. I call on the Solicitor-
</p>
<p>General to read from beginning to end all the speeches of Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell which have been given in evidence, and I defy him to find a
</p>
<p>single sentence reflecting on the person of Her Majesty. I defy him
</p>
<p>to quote from any one of Mr. O'Connell's speeches, anything in re-
</p>
<p>ference to the Queen's speech which comes within a thousand de-
</p>
<p>grees of the severity of these comments ; and I say it with pleasure,
</p>
<p>for I cannot but deprecate such observations as indicating something
</p>
<p>on the part of him who uses them which does not partake of that
</p>
<p>high feeling of loyalty which ought to characterize all well-disposed
</p>
<p>subjects, and which ought surely to characterize such constitutional
</p>
<p>productions as the Standard and the Post.
</p>
<p>The next charge is, that the traversers conspired to excite disaffec-
</p>
<p>tion and discontent among her Majesty's subjects serving in the armyand
</p>
<p>navy. It is a singular charge ; it does not allege that the traversers enter-
</p>
<p>tained any project to encourage mutiny, or desertion, or insubordination.
</p>
<p>It merely charges the traversers with exciting disaffection and discon-
</p>
<p>tent, without saying against whom. Mr. O'Connell's observations with
</p>
<p>regard to the army arose out of a tragical transaction which took place
</p>
<p>in the course of last summer; a soldier dropped down dead while on
</p>
<p>drill, a jury was empaunelled by the Crown, and found the circumstances
</p>
<p>under which he died, and added to their verdict something condem-
</p>
<p>natory of the discipline to which he had been subjected, as they
</p>
<p>thought that he had died of over fatigue, occasioned by severe drill-
</p>
<p>ing. This verdict was publicly discussed, and occasioned many com-

</p>
<p>ments in the newspapers, some of which contended that the jury
</p>
<p>were wrong in appending that statement, as it was subversive of dis-
</p>
<p>cipline, while others as stoutly maintained that the jurors were quite
</p>
<p>right in doing so, for it was full time that the grievances of the sol-
</p>
<p>diers should be inquired into. That occurrence was yet fresh in the
</p>
<p>public mind when another tragical event occurred ; a private of the
</p>
<p>5th Fusileers, a Protestant and an Englishman, stepped out of the
</p>
<p>ranks while on parade, and shot the Adjutant, a Scotch officer, dead
</p>
<p>upon the spot. This dreadful occurrence also gave rise to comments
</p>
<p>and observations ; it was said, and truly said, that there must be some-
</p>
<p>thing wrong in the discipline of the army, something oppressive to the
</p>
<p>soldiery, when a man of good character, and remarkable up to that time
</p>
<p>for his good conduct, could be guilty of an act so horrible and so atro-
</p>
<p>cious. It was the topic of general conversation. There were many pub-
</p>
<p>lications on the subject. Mr.O'Connell, incidentally, made some remarks
</p>
<p>on the subject, in one of his speeches. A letter was written by Priest
</p>
<p>524
</p>
<p>Power, to the editor of the Pilot. On that letter I will say nothing.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett is defended by his own counsel. But I merely wish to
</p>
<p>ask you, how a letter addressed to Mr. Barrett by a clergyman in the
</p>
<p>country can be given in evidence against Mr. Duffy. I complain that
</p>
<p>the gentleman with the scissors should have cut out this letter, and
</p>
<p>brought it forward against Mr. Duffy, as a proof of conspiracy.
</p>
<p>There is no evidence of a common plan to corrupt or tamper with
</p>
<p>the soldiery. It is not alleged that there was any common plan to
</p>
<p>wean their allegiance, and the only evidence in support of the
</p>
<p>charge is, that he expressed his opinion that the sergeants ought to be
</p>
<p>more frequently promoted to commissions. Gentlemen, I could re-
</p>
<p>fer you to military works, written by officers in the army, in which
</p>
<p>the same doctrine is propounded, that if there was promotion from
</p>
<p>the ranks, our army might be much improved by it. For my part, I
</p>
<p>give no opinion on the subject ; but it seems to me at least to be a
</p>
<p>fair topic for discussion, and therefore I do not see why an expres-
</p>
<p>sion of opinion on it should be dragged forward as a proof of conspi-
</p>
<p>racy, when no precise positive act can be brought forward against
</p>
<p>my client, or the other traversers, in support of the charge.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the Attorney-General dwelt much, as you may re-
</p>
<p>member, on the fact of the resolution of the Volunteers at Dun-
</p>
<p>gannon, in 1782, having been printed on the Member's Card. I
</p>
<p>will dispose of that topic as shortly as possible. I ask you, as
</p>
<p>plain sensible men, when you have heard the opinions of emi-
</p>
<p>nent men, to the effect that the Union in constitutional princi-
</p>
<p>ples is void ; do you think that those observations of the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General are just? The Attorney-General said, that such opi-
</p>
<p>nions being expressed by those eminent men in Parliament, before
</p>
<p>the act had passed, was no justification for the assertion of them,
</p>
<p>after the Union had passed into a law. To a certain extent the ob-
</p>
<p>servation is true, but the Attorney-General has pushed it too far.
</p>
<p>If that distinguished man expressed his fixed deliberate opinion that
</p>
<p>the Union was void in point of principle, what difference can it make
</p>
<p>whether that opinion was expressed before or after the measure had

</p>
<p>passed into a law ? We must suppose that his expressions faithfully
</p>
<p>represented his thoughts on the subject ; and I do not think that any
</p>
<p>man is justified in placing on record, and handing down to pos-
</p>
<p>terity, any opinion of his, with a view to prevent the passing of a
</p>
<p>law, which is not founded on truth. Is it not monstrous to charge
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell with a conspiracy for having quoted Mr. Saurin's
</p>
<p>words? Why was he not indicted before? He has been quoting
</p>
<p>those words for thirty-four years. Gentlemen, I hold in my hand
</p>
<p>a report of the trial of Mr. Magee of the Evening Post. It was
</p>
<p>a remarkable trial, and took place in the year 1813. I find in the
</p>
<p>report of Mr. O'Connell's speech, on that occasion, in page 109 of the
</p>
<p>Report, this passage : " Now, Gentlemen, of this Mr. Saurin, then an
</p>
<p>" Agitator, I beg leave to read the opinion on this Union  the author
</p>
<p>" of which we have only called artful and treacherous. From his speech
</p>
<p>" of the 13th March, 1800, I select those passages : ' Mr. Saurin said,
</p>
<p>" ' hejelt it his duty to the Crown, to the country, and to his family,
</p>
<p>525
</p>
<p><( ' towarn the Minister of the dreadful consequencesof persevering in
</p>
<p>" ' a measure which the people of Ireland almost unanimously disliked.' "
</p>
<p>And again, " ' he, for one, would assert the principles of the glorious
</p>
<p>" ' revolution, and boldly assert in the face of the nation, that when
</p>
<p>J* ' the sovereign power dissolved the compact that existed between
</p>
<p>" * the Government and the people, that moment the right of resistance
</p>
<p>" ' accrues; whether it would be prudent in the people to avail them-
</p>
<p>" ' selves of that right, would be another question ; but if a Legisla-
</p>
<p>' ' tive Union were forced on the country, against the will of its in-
</p>
<p>" ' habitants, it would be a nullity, and resistance to it would be a
</p>
<p>" < struggle against usurpation, and not a resistance against
</p>
<p>" ' law.'" Mr. Saurin was counsel on the other side ; he was present
</p>
<p>when these words were used, and he made no observation withdrawing
</p>
<p>or qualifying the opinion which he had expressed in the Irish House
</p>
<p>of Commons, thirteen years before. Let me now refer to the debates
</p>
<p>in the Irish Parliament, on the question of the Union. I will not
</p>
<p>occupy your time with reading more than a few sentences, but you
</p>
<p>will observe that there was scarcely a speaker of eminence who did
</p>
<p>not prophesy that in a few years the question of the Union would be
</p>
<p>re-argued, re-discussed, and re-investigated. You have already heard
</p>
<p>what Mr. Saurin said. Mr. Bushe, addressing Lord Castlereagh,
</p>
<p>said : " Let me adjure the noble Lord to weigh well and consider
</p>
<p>" deeply the probable permanency of a measure so conducted. Let
</p>
<p>" me implore him to avail himself of the passing experience of his
</p>
<p>" own days, and of the instructions which history may afford him, and
</p>
<p>" when he sees volcanic revolutions desolating the face of tho politi-
</p>
<p>M cal world  the first elementary principles of society loosening and
</p>
<p>" dissolving, and empires, not built upon the liberties of the people,
</p>
<p><' crumbling into dust  let him contemplate the awful change which
</p>
<p>" he is about to accomplish, and consider the responsibility he incurs
</p>
<p>" to his Sovereign by exchanging the affections of a loyal nation for
</p>
<p>" the reluctant obedience of a degraded and defrauded province. Let
</p>
<p>" him look for the permanency of this transaction something further
</p>
<p>" than to the vote of to-night, or the job of the morning, and let him

<p>" have some better document than his army list for the affections of
</p>
<p>" the people. Let him consider whether posterity will validate this
</p>
<p>" act, if they believe the Constitution of their ancestors was plundered
</p>
<p>" by force, or was filched by practice. Let him, before it be too
</p>
<p>" late, seriously ponder whether posterity will validate this Act, if
</p>
<p>" they believe that the basest corruption and artifice were ex-
</p>
<p>" erted to promote it ; that all the worst passions of the
</p>
<p>" human breast were enlisted into the service, and all the most
</p>
<p>" depraved ingenuity of the human intellect tortured to devise
</p>
<p>" new contrivances of fraud. I do not say these things have been  I
</p>
<p>"state hypothetically, and ask, if posterity believe such things, will
</p>
<p>" they validate the transaction ? If they believe that there was foul
</p>
<p>" play, from the first moment to the last, both within doors and with-
</p>
<p>" out; that the rabble were appealed to from the Parliament, and
</p>
<p>" debauched or intimidated to petition against the Constitution of
</p>
<p>" their country ; if they believe that in Parliament, the disgust of the
</p>
<p>526
</p>
<p>" measure, notwithstanding a proscription which made office incom-
</p>
<p>" patible with honour, and stained the treasury bench  that the dis-
</p>
<p>" gust of the measure broke asunder and dissociated laws of the ten-
</p>
<p>" derest and most delicate connexions of human life ; that the nomi-
</p>
<p>" rial office of Escheator of Munster beeame an office of competition,
</p>
<p>" and after the Parliament was thus reduced, that the Irish Commons
</p>
<p>" were recruited from the English staff. If they were to believe these
</p>
<p>" things, and that human frailty and human necessities were so prac-
</p>
<p>" tised upon, that the private sentiments and the public conduct of
</p>
<p>" several could not be reconciled, and that where the Minister could
</p>
<p>" influence twenty votes he could not command one. I say not
</p>
<p>" that these things were so, but I ask you, if posterity believe
</p>
<p>" them to have been so, will posterity validate this transaction  will
</p>
<p>" they feel themselves bound to do so ? I answer, where a transac-
</p>
<p>" tion, though fortified by seven-fold form, is radically fraudulent,
</p>
<p>" that all the forms and solemnities of law are but so many badges of
</p>
<p>" the fraud ; and that posterity, like a great court of conscience, will
</p>
<p>" pronounce its judgment." Another of the learned Judges of the
</p>
<p>land, who has since retired from the Bench, I mean Mr. Justice Moore,
</p>
<p>spoke on that occasion. His words will be found at page 81, in the
</p>
<p>last volume of the Debates : " Sir, I have no hesitation to say, that if
</p>
<p>" they carry the measure under all the circumstances which I have
</p>
<p>" stated and observed upon, it will be a robbery and not a treaty  an
</p>
<p>" act of constraint and violence, not of compact and volition  a con-
</p>
<p>*< quest, not a union. Union upon such principles, and accomplished
</p>
<p>" by such means, policy never can require, justice can never sanctify,
</p>
<p>" wisdom never can approve, patriotism never can reconcile, time never
</p>
<p>" can cement, and force never can establish. It might be a Union
</p>
<p>" for a few days, a few months, perhaps for a few years ; but it would
</p>
<p>" be followed by ages of ill blood, generations of hostility, centuries
</p>
<p>" of contest, and desolation and misery to this island to all eternity.
</p>
<p>" It would be a Union founded on the violation of public faith, erect-
</p>
<p>" ed on national degradation  equally subversive of the moral, phy-
</p>
<p>" sical, and political fitness of things, and equally odious and abomi-

<p>" nable in the sight of God and man.'' Gentlemen, I will give you
</p>
<p>only the closing words of Grattan on that occasion. He said: " The
</p>
<p>" question is not now such as occupied you of old. Not old Poyn-

<p>" your life to come. Whether you will go with the Castle at your
</p>
<p>" head, to the tomb of Charlemont and the Volunteers, and erase
</p>
<p>" his epitaph, or whether your children go to your graves saying, 'A
</p>
<p>" ' venal, a militai'y court attacked the liberties of the Irish, and
</p>
<p>" ' here lie the bones of the honourable dead men who saved their
</p>
<p>" ' country.' Such an epitaph is a nobility which the King cannot
</p>
<p>" give his slaves  'tis a glory which the crown cannot give the
</p>
<p>" King." Gentlemen of the Jury, Mr. Saurin made a speech on
</p>
<p>that occasion ; and when we refer to a man's speech, we should take
</p>
<p>into account his character, and the circumstances of the man
</p>
<p>speaking. We should see if the man is a rash and fiery politician, and
</p>
<p>527
</p>
<p>that his words are not entitled to respect and esteem. Was that man
</p>
<p>rash and fiery ? No ; he was remarkable for the solidity of his judg-
</p>
<p>ment, the seriousness of his mind, the gravity of his style, governed
</p>
<p>and directed by conscience and wise discretion ; he did not contend
</p>
<p>certainly that the Parliament might not be so constituted as not to
</p>
<p>pass a Bill of Union ; but he said, " you are not elected by the Irish
</p>
<p>" people with the knowledge that you are brought here to vote away
</p>
<p>" the liberties of that people. I tell you, if you do so it is illegal and
</p>
<p>" void." Before the Scotch Union was carried, a notice was given to
</p>
<p>the people, that the representatives were to be elected for that pur-
</p>
<p>pose. Mr. Saurin said : " But I conjure the House to consider well
</p>
<p>" not only the nature of the measure itself, but the effect which it
</p>
<p>" may have on the country, before it accedes to the present reso-
</p>
<p>" lution. Under the Constitution of Ireland we have lived happy,
</p>
<p>" we have all bettered our condition, our country has advanced to
</p>
<p>" greatness with uncommon rapidity, our commerce has increased,
</p>
<p>" our agriculture improved, our laws have assumed a sublime and
</p>
<p>" impartial character, it has furnished every thing for hope and no-
</p>
<p>" thing for despondency. It is that Constitution which has given
</p>
<p>" those benefits, to which we have sworn allegiance; and I caution
</p>
<p>" those who would annihilate it for ever, of the heavy weight of
</p>
<p>" responsibility which they must incur in the prosecution of the pro-
</p>
<p>" ject. If the measure is a good one, and you think it deserving of
</p>
<p>" being considered by the country, dissolve the Parliament, and take
</p>
<p>" the sense of the nation constitutionally. I know no other mode
</p>
<p>" in which the voice of the country can be properly collected ; but
</p>
<p>" do not introduce the placemen whom you have sent out, and call
</p>
<p>"their return an expression of the voice of the nation. Give the
</p>
<p>" country fair play ; let it speak through its constitutional organ ; its
</p>
<p>" voice will have its weight, and you at least will, if you should be
</p>
<p>" disposed to entertain this measure, have a decent colour for your
</p>
<p>" proceedings. Sir, I do not wish to recur to the unhappy scenes
</p>
<p>" which have lately so materially injured our country ; but it should
</p>
<p>" be remembered that the Profession of which I am a member, which

</p>
<p>" from its education, its habits, its zeal to defend the Constitution
</p>
<p>" in the hours of its danger, that that Profession has expressed itself
</p>
<p>" decidedly against this measure, and your incompetency to entertain
</p>
<p>" it. From the rank which I hold in that Profession, many of my
</p>
<p>" friends think that it may be conducive to the public cause that I
</p>
<p>" should appear in this House to give the measure of the Union a
</p>
<p>" most decided negative ; no other earthly consideration could have
</p>
<p>" induced me to trespass on your patience. I have come forward at
</p>
<p>" their solicitation ; and when 1 tell you 1 am an enemy to union, it
</p>
<p>" is because I am an ardent friend to His Majesty's Crown, and to
</p>
<p>" British connexion." Gentlemen, I will trouble you but with one
</p>
<p>word more  it is the opinion of the Hon. J. Fitzgerald. He sat in
</p>
<p>Parliament at that time. He held the important and lucrative office
</p>
<p>of Prime Sergeant. He was called on to support the measure.
</p>
<p>Rather than do so, he resigned his place, because he said his con-
</p>
<p>science would not permit him to hold it. "The genius, the ambition, and
</p>
<p>528
</p>
<p>" the aspiring thoughts of man are not to he controlled; and little reason
</p>
<p>" have we,dressed in a little hrief and questionable authority, to expect
</p>
<p>" that the increasing population of four|millions of people will respect this
</p>
<p>" compact, if entered into, as sacred. It will be handed down to them
</p>
<p>" with the history of the present day, and the means taken to effect
</p>
<p>" this mighty change. There will be a look back. They will be told
</p>
<p>" that the country was called upon to this compact, when martial law
</p>
<p>"was in full force. They will hear of the years 1779 and 1782.
</p>
<p>u They will inquire how they lost the great acquisition of those days :
</p>
<p>" a free, residing, superintending legislature. They will inquire by
</p>
<p>" what means they lost the power of granting supplies, the true source
</p>
<p>" of national independence, and the great constitutional control of the
</p>
<p>" executive power, whether resident or non-resident ; and much I fear,
</p>
<p>" that, dazzled by the splendour, without the loyalty and moderation of
</p>
<p>" 1782, similar claims may be made, and Great Britain may not be
</p>
<p>" found in a similar disposition to concede. My soul aches, to think
</p>
<p>" with what ease confusion in that gap may enter, and by the one
</p>
<p>" country take the other. Under those impressions I differ from
</p>
<p>" those with whom I had so long acted. I still differ from them with
</p>
<p>" respect, and without resentment ; and shall vote with the Hon.
</p>
<p>" Baronet."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you see what that great man foresaw. Yes, he fore-
</p>
<p>saw that posterity would inquire into the means by which they lost
</p>
<p>that greatest of blessings, a free, superintending, resident Parliament.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General observed that these were passing speeches
</p>
<p>made in the heat of debate. The same eminent men were not
</p>
<p>satisfied with passing speeches. They left on record their opinions
</p>
<p>on the subject of the Union. They drew up a solemn and elaborate
</p>
<p>document in the nature of a protest, in order to perpetuate on the
</p>
<p>records of Parliament, and to hand down to posterity their senti-
</p>
<p>ments on the subject of the Union. Lord Corry, the son of Lord
</p>
<p>Belvidere, moved the Protest and Address to his Majesty. It is
</p>
<p>given in the 4th Vol. of G rattan's speeches, and is as follows:

<p>" declared that this measure offers, to be its instant and immediate
</p>
<p>" consequence, we do not hesitate to say expressly that we could
</p>
<p>" not harbour the thought of accepting them in exchange for our
</p>
<p>" Parliament, or that we could or would barter our freedom for
</p>
<p>" commerce, or our Constitution for revenue ; but the offers are
</p>
<p>" mere impositions, and we state with the firmest confidence that in
</p>
<p>" commerce or trade their measure confirms no one advantage, nor
</p>
<p>" can it confer any ; for, by your Majesty's gracious and paternal
</p>
<p>" attention to this your ancient realm of Ireland, every restriction
</p>
<p>" under which its commerce laboured has been removed during your
</p>
<p>" Majesty's auspicious reign, and we are now as free to trade to all
</p>
<p>" the world as Britain is. In manufactures, any attempt it makes
</p>
<p>" to offer any benefit which we do not now enjoy, is vain and delu-
</p>
<p>" sive, and whenever it is to have effect, that effect will be to our
</p>
<p>" injury. Most of the duties on imports which operate as'protections
</p>
<p>" to our manufactures are, under its provisions, either to be removed
</p>
<p>529
</p>
<p>" or reduced immediately, and those which will he reduced arc to
</p>
<p>" cease entirely at a limited lime, though many of our manufac-
</p>
<p>" turers owe their existence to the protection of those duties ; and
</p>
<p>" though it is not in the power of human wisdom to foresee any
</p>
<p>" precise time when they may be able to thrive without them.
</p>
<p>" Your Majesty's faithful Commons feel more than an ordinary in-
</p>
<p>" terest in laying this fact before you ; because they have, under
</p>
<p>" your Majesty's approbation, raised up and nursed many of those
</p>
<p>" manufactures, and by so doing, have encouraged much capital to
</p>
<p>" be vested in them ; the proprietors of which are now to be left
</p>
<p>" unprotected, and to be deprived of the Parliament on whose faith
</p>
<p>" they embarked themselves, their families, and properties, in the
</p>
<p>"undertaking." And again: " But it is not only in respect to
</p>
<p>" these delusions held out as to trade and revenue, that we feel it
</p>
<p>" our duty to lay before your Majesty the conduct of your Ministers
</p>
<p>" in this measure. We must state the means by which they have
</p>
<p>" endeavoured to carry it. That in the first instance, admitting the
</p>
<p>" necessity of conforming to the sense of the Parliament and the
</p>
<p>" people, they took the sense of the Commons, and found that sense
</p>
<p>" to be against it ; that they then affected to appeal against the
</p>
<p>" Parliament to the people, at the same time endeavouring by their
</p>
<p>" choice of sheriffs, to obstruct the regular and constitutional mode
</p>
<p>" whereby the sense of the people has been usually collected ; that
</p>
<p>" on the contrary, they did use, or abet and encourage the using of
</p>
<p>" various arts and stratagems to procure from individuals of the
</p>
<p>" lowest order, some of whom were their prisoners and felons, scan-
</p>
<p>" dalous signatures against the Constitution; that notwithstanding
</p>
<p>" these attempts to procure a fallacious appearance of strength and
</p>
<p>" muster against Parliament, the people have expressed their senti-
</p>
<p>" merits decidedly against the Union, and twenty- cue counties at
</p>
<p>" public meetings legally convened, and also many other counties by
</p>
<p>" petitions signed by the freeholders, and many cities and towns,
</p>
<p>" have expressed either to your Majesty or to this House, or to both,
</p>
<p>" their decided and unalterable hostility to this Union ; yet your

<p>" ministers have, as we believe, taken upon them to state to your
</p>
<p>"Majesty, and your ministers in Britain, in defiance of all these
</p>
<p>" facts, that the sense of the nation is not adverse to the measure ;
</p>
<p>"that if there could be any doubt that your Majesty's Ministers
</p>
<p>" in the appointment of sheriffs, did consider how they might obstruct
</p>
<p>" the people in delivering their opinion regarding the Union, that doubt
</p>
<p>" is fully explained by their continuing in office the sheriff of the
</p>
<p>" former year in more than one instance, whence it also appears
</p>
<p>" how decidedly the sense of the country is against this measure,
</p>
<p>" when your Majesty's Ministers found it difficult to procure any
</p>
<p>" person to serve the office of Sheriff who was properly qualified, and
</p>
<p>" was also a friend to the measure, that finding the sense of the peo-
</p>
<p>" pie, as well as the Parliament, to be against it, your Majesty's Mi-
</p>
<p>" nisters attempted to change the Parliament itself, and refusing to
</p>
<p>" take the sense of the nation by a general election, they procured a
</p>
<p>" partial dissolution, and did so publicly abuse the disqualifying clause
</p>
<p>3Y
</p>
<p>530
</p>
<p>" in the Place Bill which was enacted for the express purpose of
</p>
<p>" procuring the freedom and independence of Parliament, that by
</p>
<p>" vacating seats under its authority, very many new returns were
</p>
<p>" made to this House, for the purpose of carrying it, and thus did
</p>
<p>" they change the Parliament without resorting to the people ; that
</p>
<p>" before the Ministry had perverted the Place Bill, the sense of Par-
</p>
<p>" liament was against their Union, and if that bill had not been so
</p>
<p>" perverted, that sense had remained unaltered; that of those who
</p>
<p>" voted for the Union, we beg leave to inform your Majesty, that
</p>
<p>" seventy-six had places or pensions under the Crown, and others
</p>
<p>" were under the immediate influence of constituents, who held
</p>
<p>" great offices under the Crown ; that the practices of influence
</p>
<p>" above-mentioned, were accompanied by the removal from office of
</p>
<p>" various servants of the Crown, who had seats in Parliament, par-
</p>
<p>" ticularly the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Prime Sergeant,
</p>
<p>" three Commissioners of Revenue, a Commissioner of Accounts,
</p>
<p>" a Commissioner of Barracks, and the Cursitor of the Court of Chan-
</p>
<p>" eery, because they would not vote away the Parliament ; also by
</p>
<p>" their withdrawing their confidence from others of your Majesty's
</p>
<p>" faithful and able Councillors for the same reason ; that they pro-
</p>
<p>" enred or encouraged the purchase of seats in this House, to return
</p>
<p>" Members to vote for the Union ; also, the introduction of persons
</p>
<p>" unconnected with this country, to vote away her Parliament; that
</p>
<p>" they have also attempted to prostitute the peerage, by promising
</p>
<p>" to persons, not even Commoners in Parliament, her sacred
</p>
<p>"honours, if they would come into this House and vote for the
</p>
<p>" Union ; and that finally, they have annexed to their plan of
</p>
<p>" Union, an artful device, whereby a million and a half of money
</p>
<p>" is to be given to private persons possessing returns, who are to
</p>
<p>" receive said sum on the event of the Union, for the carry-
</p>
<p>" ing of which to such an amount said persons are to be paid ; and
</p>
<p>" this nation is to make good the sale by which she is thus disin-
</p>
<p>" herited of her Parliament, and is to be taxed for ever to raise the
</p>
<p>" whole amount, although, if your Ministers shall persevere in such a

<p>" flagrant, unconstitutional scheme, and the money is to be raised, it
</p>
<p>" is for the Union, and being, therefore, an imperial concern, ought
</p>
<p>" to be borne in the proportion already laid down for imperial ex-
</p>
<p>" penses, that is, two-seventeenths by Ireland, and fifteen-seven-
</p>
<p>" teenths by Britain ; that under these unconstitutional circum-
</p>
<p>" stances, your Majesty's Ministers have endeavoured, against the
</p>
<p>" declared sense of the people, to impose upon them a new Constitu-
</p>
<p>" tion, subverting the old." And again, "That whether we rest on
</p>
<p>" this incontrovertible and self-evident truth, that no Parliament in
</p>
<p>" another kingdom can have the local information or knowledge of
</p>
<p>" the manners, habits, wants, or wishes of the nation, which its own
</p>
<p>" Parliament naturally possesses, and which is requisite for beneficial
</p>
<p>" legislation, nor can be supplied with the necessary information,
</p>
<p>" either as promptly or accurately; or whether we look to the clear
</p>
<p>" proofs of that truth which the progress of this measure has afforded
</p>
<p>" by our Ministers having called to their assistance, in London, the
</p>
<p>531
</p>
<p>w great officers of this kingdom, most likely from their station, to give
</p>
<p>" full information for framing their measure ; and though all their
</p>
<p>" talents, and all their own information, and what they obtained by
</p>
<p>" letters while it was pending, were employed for months there, yet
</p>
<p>" when they brought it back, a few hours, or rather a few minutes'
</p>
<p>" inquiry on the spot, in Dublin, forced them to alter their project in
</p>
<p>" very many articles, complete and perfect as they thought it. We
</p>
<p>" have strong additional reason to feel and to represent the manifest
</p>
<p>" and irreparable injuries which this kingdom must sustain by the
</p>
<p>" want of a resident Parliament, and the impossibility of legislation
</p>
<p>" being carried on for it as it ought to be.
</p>
<p>" Therefore, inasmuch as the Union is an unnecessary innova-
</p>
<p>" tion, and innovations, at all times hazardous, are rendered pecu-
</p>
<p>" liarly so by the awful situation of the times. Inasmuch, too,
</p>
<p>" as, far from being an innocent experiment, it is replete with
</p>
<p>" changes injurious to our trade and manufactures, and our re-
</p>
<p>u venues. Inasmuch, also, as it destroys our Constitution which was
</p>
<p>" worked well, and substitutes a new one, the benefits of which
</p>
<p>" we cannot see; but the numerous evils and dangers of which are
</p>
<p>" apparent, and which, in every change it offers, militates against
</p>
<p>" some known and established principle of the British Constitution.
</p>
<p>" Inasmuch, also, as it so far endangers the Constitution of Bri-
</p>
<p>" tain as not to leave us the certainty of enjoying a free Constitution
</p>
<p>" there when our own shall be destroyed.
</p>
<p>" Inasmuch as it tends to impoverish and subjugate Ireland, with-
</p>
<p>" out giving wealth or strength to Britain.
</p>
<p>" Inasmuch as it tends to raise and perpetuate discontent and
</p>
<p>"jealousies, to create new and strengthen old distinctions of interests
</p>
<p>" in our concerns of trade, manufactures, revenue, and Constitution,

<p>" and instead of increasing the connexion between the two king-

<p>" ter, debases its rank from a kingdom to that of a dependent pro-
</p>
<p>" vince, yet leaves us every expense and mark of a kingdom but the
</p>
<p>" essential one of a Parliament ; inasmuch as it has been proposed
</p>
<p>" and hitherto carried against the decided and expressed sense of the
</p>
<p>" people, notwithstanding the improper means resorted to to prevent
</p>
<p>" that sense being declared, and to misrepresent it when known. In-
</p>
<p>" asmuch as it leaves to be determined by the chance of drawing
</p>
<p>" lots, the choice of thirty-two Members to represent as many great
</p>
<p>" cities and towns, with a levity which tends to turn into ridicule the
</p>
<p>" sacred and serious trust of a representative ; and while it commits
</p>
<p>" to one person the office which the Constitution commits to two, of
</p>
<p>" speaking the voice of the people and granting their money, it does
</p>
<p>" not allow the electors to choose which of the two they will intrust
</p>
<p>" with that power.
</p>
<p>" And inasmuch as means the most unconstitutional, influence
</p>
<p>532
</p>
<p>" the most undue, and bribes openly avowed, have been resorted to
</p>
<p>" to carry it against tbe known senses of the Commons and the peo-
</p>
<p>" pie, during the existence of martial law through the land; we feel
</p>
<p>" it our bounden duty to ourselves, our country, and our posterity to
</p>
<p>" lay this our most solemn protest and prayer before your Majesty,
</p>
<p>" that you will be graciously pleased to extend your paternal pro-
</p>
<p>" tection to your faithful and loyal subjects, and to save them from
</p>
<p>" the danger threatened by your Majesty's Ministers in this their
</p>
<p>" ruinous and destructive project, humbly declaring with the most
</p>
<p>" cordial and warm sincerity that we are actuated therein by an irre-
</p>
<p>" sistible sense of duty, by an unshaken loyalty to your Majesty, by
</p>
<p>*J a veneration for the British name, by an ardent attachment to the
</p>
<p>" British nation, with whom we have so often declared we will stand
</p>
<p>" or fall, and by a determination to preserve for ever the connexion
</p>
<p>" between the two kingdoms, on which the happiness, the power,
</p>
<p>" and the strengh of each irrevocably and unalterably depend."
</p>
<p>Now, I observe that Mr. Saurin was one of the tellers upon that
</p>
<p>division ; the numbers were 77 to 135 ; he was therefore a party to
</p>
<p>that deliberate, formal, document now on record, which contains his
</p>
<p>sentiments upon that occasion. Mr. Toler, who was so peculiarly
</p>
<p>distinguished for his legal acquirements, voted for the Union, and
</p>
<p>obtained a peerage, while Mr. Saurin died a Commoner ; and this was
</p>
<p>one of the advantages gained to the country by the Union. Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, it has been observed by the Attorney-General, that the
</p>
<p>state and condition of Ireland, at the time the Volunteers were es-
</p>
<p>tablished, warranted them in the resolutions which they adopted, but
</p>
<p>that the present state of the law does not justify a similar line of
</p>
<p>conduct. The argument fails him. His argument was, that at that
</p>
<p>time Ireland had a Parliament perfectly independent and separate
</p>
<p>from England, but that England had usurped the right, by 6 Geo.
</p>
<p>I. to pass laws to bind this country, although the Irish then had a
</p>
<p>Parliament of their own, and that therefore the Volunteers were jus-
</p>
<p>tified in combining in the way they did, because the Act of 6 Geo.
</p>
<p>I. was an insult and an affront to the country, and gave a right to

</p>
<p>England to treat Ireland as a dependent country. Ireland had then a
</p>
<p>Parliament, and therefore the Volunteers had a right to pass the re-
</p>
<p>solutions which they did pass. That argument fails him ; for Lord
</p>
<p>Coke says, in 4 Inst., that the Parliament of England had the power
</p>
<p>to bind Ireland by expressly naming it. Therefore that Statute of 6
</p>
<p>Geo. I. was law when the Volunteers came into existence, and conse-
</p>
<p>quently those resolutions were against the letter, though not against
</p>
<p>the spirit, of the law. Thus the Attorney- General's argument may
</p>
<p>be turned against himself, for if it was justifiable to pass resolutions
</p>
<p>condemnatory of the English Act and againsttheletterof thelaw, when
</p>
<p>we hadaParliamenthere, which has been deprived of its authority, how
</p>
<p>much more justifiable is it to adopt resolutions in the spirit of those
</p>
<p>of the Volunteers, when we have lost that Parliament, with the be-
</p>
<p>nefits of a resident legislature. I find in looking again at the reso-
</p>
<p>lutions that an ancestor of my friend Mr. Tomb attested, by his own
</p>
<p>signature, that it was illegal, unconstitutional, and a grievance to at-
</p>
<p>533
</p>
<p>tempt to bind the people of Ireland by an English Act of Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment, although it might be according to the letter of the law, it
</p>
<p>was contrary to the spirit.
</p>
<p>The Attorney- General has said that the Act of Union was a great
</p>
<p>and a final settlement ; I shall show you that that argument destroys
</p>
<p>the very principle upon which the foundation of the Union rests. If
</p>
<p>he means to contend that an Act of Parliament contains a provision for
</p>
<p>its finality, that destroys that foundation of the Act of Union, for a
</p>
<p>previous Act had provided the reverse. The Volunteers, therefore,
</p>
<p>made no mistake. Why ? They found that by the 6 Geo. I. the
</p>
<p>Parliament of England had presumed to bind the people of Ireland,
</p>
<p>and they called on the people of England to abandon and to repeal
</p>
<p>that Act, and they succeeded. The Parliaments of both countries
</p>
<p>passed that solemn Declaration of Rights to which Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>has referred, and from which he has drawn an argument, which
</p>
<p>was signed and ratified by the Lord Lieutenant as a final settlement
</p>
<p>between the two countries. That was the Statute 23 Geo. III.
</p>
<p>c. 28 (England), by which it was enacted, " That the right claimed by
</p>
<p>" the people of Ireland to be bound only by laws enacted by His
</p>
<p>" Majesty, and the Parliament of that kingdom, in all cases what-
</p>
<p>" ever, and to have all actions and suits at law or in equity, which
</p>
<p>u may be instituted in that kingdom, decided by His Majesty's
</p>
<p>" Court, therein finally, and without appeal from thence, shall
</p>
<p>" be, and it is hereby declared to be established and ascertained for
</p>
<p>" ever, and shall at no time hereafter be questioned or question-
</p>
<p>" able." Lord Mountnorris, in the " Transactions of the Irish Par-
</p>
<p>" liament," page 399, speaking of that Statute, says : " The asser-
</p>
<p>" tion and declaration of the Irish powers, and the final renunciation
</p>
<p>" of the English Parliament in 1781, have established upon an eternal,
</p>
<p>" irrevocable foundation the sole right of their own Parliament to
</p>
<p>" legislate for Ireland." That Act in the course of eighteen years was
</p>
<p>repealed, although it contained stronger language, indicating the in-
</p>
<p>tention of the Legislature, that it was to be a final and irrevocable
</p>
<p>settlement, between the two countries. And yet we are told that

</p>
<p>the traversers are not at liberty to discuss the expediency or the
</p>
<p>justice of repealing the Act of Union. I therefore submit to your
</p>
<p>better judgment, that the argument of the Attorney-General on that
</p>
<p>ground is of no value, and that the traversers have just as much a
</p>
<p>right to insist that the Act of Union should be repealed, as they
</p>
<p>who passed the Act of Union had to insist that the Statute 23 Geo,
</p>
<p>III. c. 28, should be repealed. Molyneux in his " State of Ireland,"
</p>
<p>page 105, says : " Shall we of this kingdom be denied the birth-right
</p>
<p>" of every free born English subject by having laws imposed on us,
</p>
<p>" when we are neither personally nor representatively present." That
</p>
<p>celebrated book met with a fate which it did not deserve. The
</p>
<p>English Parliament ordered that it should be burned, and thereby
</p>
<p>much increased the estimation in which it was held in this country.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I shall next call your attention to the consideration of
</p>
<p>another subject, the mode by which Mr. O'Connell asserted that the
</p>
<p>Irish Parliament should be revived. Mr, O'Connell in that ex-
</p>
<p>534
</p>
<p>traordinary document sets forth the whole of the Irish population,
</p>
<p>and states his opinion, that household suffrage is the best. Why
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, that is the suffrage we have at present in Dublin. Every
</p>
<p>man who has a house worth 10, possesses a vote, and there are
</p>
<p>very few houses in Dublin not worth 10. The Duke of Richmond,
</p>
<p>who was examined by Mr. Erskine, on the trial of Hardy, was of
</p>
<p>opinion, that the whole system of the franchise was corrupt, and that
</p>
<p>every man who had not committed a crime ought to have a vote,
</p>
<p>and that there ought to be Annual Parliaments, Universal Suffrage,
</p>
<p>and Vote by Ballot. This was expressed in language much more vio-
</p>
<p>lent than that used by the traversers, and yet the jury decided that
</p>
<p>he had a right to hold that opinion, all which was very well for a
</p>
<p>Duke. In his letter, addressed to Colonel Sharman, he states, that
</p>
<p>" it might be a better arrangement to have only one Parliament,
</p>
<p>" provided the Sovereign of England should reside a reasonable time
</p>
<p>" in this country, and hold her Imperial Parliament in it, which he said
</p>
<p>" Her Majesty could do with a scrape of her pen," and, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>I hope sincerely she may. It is a positive insult to the understanding
</p>
<p>of any man to say that such would not be a blessing to this country,
</p>
<p>improve her trade, her manufactures, and her resources. Even our
</p>
<p>Profession would be benefited by it, for the residence of Her Most
</p>
<p>Gracious Majesty in this country would not prevent her loyal sub-
</p>
<p>jects from going to law. The Attorney-General adopted the So-
</p>
<p>cratic method in his argument with us ; he put questions to us, which
</p>
<p>he required us to answer. Now, I am not bound to maintain the
</p>
<p>doctrines propounded by others who spoke before me, but I shall
</p>
<p>show that there is reason in what they said. Can it be alleged, that
</p>
<p>it is revolutionary to state that every town possessing 10,000 inhabi-
</p>
<p>tants, should have a representative? Why that is but the principle
</p>
<p>of the Reform Bill. Mr. O'Connell also says, that every man who
</p>
<p>marries shall have a vote. If that be a conspiracy, it is a conspiracy
</p>
<p>in favour of matrimony, and I think I may make my learned friend a
</p>
<p>present of it. If the question is to be tried by ayH'jury, I think
</p>
<p>they would decree in our favour. The Attorney-General has en-

</p>
<p>deavoured to persuade you that Mr. O'Connell's intention was, that
</p>
<p>Her Majesty was to be pulled from her throne  the House of Peers
</p>
<p>to be abolished  and the House of Commons extinguished! Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, if he has been guilty of any crime in this respect, it is of the
</p>
<p>monstrous crime of extending the prerogative of the Crown. The
</p>
<p>Attorney-General, the legal champion of the Crown, charges it as a
</p>
<p>crime against Mr. O'Connell, that he said the Queen has a larger,
</p>
<p>wider, and more extended prerogative than Her Majesty possesses.
</p>
<p>Suppose he did say so, where is the authorityin which it is laid down,
</p>
<p>that the man who propounded such a proposition  that the man who
</p>
<p>says that the Sovereign has greater authority than she really has, is
</p>
<p>guilty of conspiracy ? If you say that the Sovereign has greater pre-
</p>
<p>rogative power than she has, are you therefore to be charged with a
</p>
<p>conspiracy ? What authority is there for saying that Mr. Duffy, Mr.
</p>
<p>Steele, or any one else is to be charged with conspiracy, because,
</p>
<p>when they heard such a proposition, they did not say to the person
</p>
<p>535
</p>
<p>propounding, as we lawyers do, prove what you assert by some autho-
</p>
<p>rity, cite a case to show that Her Majesty has the power to dis-
</p>
<p>pense with the Act of Union, and to summon an Irish Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment. Suppose that Mr. O'Connell, instead of saying that Parliament
</p>
<p>should be reformed  that the Parliament should be extended to
</p>
<p>Ireland  that everything had gone wrong, and that the Irish Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment should be revived  that no power on earth had a right to make
</p>
<p>laws for Ireland, but the King, Lords, and Commons of Ireland, in
</p>
<p>accordance with the resolutions of the Volunteers in 1782  that the
</p>
<p>Act of Union was a nullity in accordance with the opinion of Mr.
</p>
<p>Saurin ; suppose he said, 1 am of opinion that the Parliament is a
</p>
<p>humbug  a nuisance, that Her Majesty has a perfect right to
</p>
<p>rule by her own word, without a Parliament, when she likes,
</p>
<p>and where she likes, for the Queen is an unalterable part of
</p>
<p>the Constitution, and may dispense with Lords and Commons 
</p>
<p>What would be the consequence? I will cite to you a case in point.
</p>
<p>A celebrated writer in England published a book, in which he said
</p>
<p>the House of Commons was unnecessary. The House of Commons
</p>
<p>took huff at that, and said that that doctrine was unconstitutional,
</p>
<p>and voted the book to be a scandalous and seditious libel, and pre-
</p>
<p>sented an address to the Sovereign, praying him to direct the Attorney
</p>
<p>General to prosecute the publisher of such a monstrous opinion, and
</p>
<p>a prosecution was accordingly instituted. That is the case of Rex v.
</p>
<p>Reeves, 2 Peake, N.P. Cases ; and Lord Kenyon then laid it dow n, " that
</p>
<p>" the right of free discussion was the right of every subject of this
</p>
<p>" country ; a right to the free exercise of which we were indebted,
</p>
<p>" more than to any other claimed by Englishmen, for the enjoyment
</p>
<p>" of all the blessings that we possess, for the Reformation, the Re-
</p>
<p>" volution, and our emancipation from the tyranny of the Stuarts ;
</p>
<p>" and that in a free country like this, the productions of a political
</p>
<p>" writer should not be harshly dealt with." He directed the jury to
</p>
<p>read through the whole book, and then form their judgment on the
</p>
<p>entire work. That was his charge ; and I need not say to you that
</p>
<p>the people of England are justly attached to the judicial system un-
</p>

</p>
<p>der which they live, when you hear it laid down by the Lord Chief
</p>
<p>Justice of England, a doctrine so favourable to freedom. The jury
</p>
<p>in that case retired ; they had the book before them ; and though
</p>
<p>they had the address of the Parliament, declaring that the book was
</p>
<p>improper^ yet nevertheless they gave a verdict of acquittal. The
</p>
<p>language there was extravagant, the doctrine unsound, but the jury
</p>
<p>looked upon it with the eyes of men of sense, and they qualified
</p>
<p>their verdict by saying, they disapproved of what was said, and the
</p>
<p>mode the argument was conducted; they found a verdict of not
</p>
<p>guilty, and the Chief Justice approved of that verdict. Therefore,
</p>
<p>if Mr. O'Connell had said that Her Majesty might dispense with the
</p>
<p>House of Lords, he would be safe, according to the authority of that
</p>
<p>case. If he said the Queen might dispense with the House of Com-
</p>
<p>mons, he would be safe, according to the authority of that case.
</p>
<p>But what has he said ? That the Irish Peerage ought to be restored
</p>
<p>to the position in which it stood before the Union ; that the Llouse
</p>
<p>53G
</p>
<p>of Lords and the House of Commons ought to be restored. In
</p>
<p>England, the right of free discussion is the right of every En-
</p>
<p>glishman ; and I put it to your good sense to say, whether the
</p>
<p>arguments of the writer of that book, or Mr. O'Connell's argu-
</p>
<p>ment, is more consistent with the principles of the Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion. The Attorney-General called on the traversers' counsel
</p>
<p>to assert, if they could, that Her Majesty had power to sum-
</p>
<p>mon an Irish Parliament, notwithstanding the Act of Union. Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, the power and prerogative of the Crown to issue writs
</p>
<p>to summon a Parliament, seem to have been very extensive under
</p>
<p>the old law. There is no authority for asserting that that prero-
</p>
<p>gative does not yet exist ; but no Minister, in modern times, would
</p>
<p>advise Her Majesty to exercise that prerogative. Queen Eliza-
</p>
<p>beth omitted sending writs to ten boroughs, in order to have a ma-
</p>
<p>jority. Hallam, in his " History of the Constitution," mentions many
</p>
<p>instances of the Crown withholding writs from places accustomed to
</p>
<p>send members to Parliament. If you look to the Parliamentary
</p>
<p>History you will find the most learned and elaborate discourse
</p>
<p>which perhaps was ever written, by Sir John Davies, the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General, to King James I., and is to be found in the Appendix to
</p>
<p>Leland's History of Ireland. In that discourse you will find the
</p>
<p>right of the Sovereign, namely to create forty boroughs in one day,
</p>
<p>vindicated. It was questioned in Parliament whether he had a right
</p>
<p>to do so ; the question was discussed, carried over to England, and it
</p>
<p>was decided in favour of his right, and those persons so elected under
</p>
<p>his writs sat in Parliament to the period of the Union. The last in-
</p>
<p>stance of the kind was the issuing a writ for the borough of Newark ;
</p>
<p>that was disputed, and it was decided by the House of Commons that
</p>
<p>the Sovereign had a right to create the borough, and that by a very
</p>
<p>large majority. Mr. O'Connell's argument is that the Sovereign has
</p>
<p>still this right. Chitty, in his work on the Prerogative of the Crown,
</p>
<p>enters into that question. He says, in p. 67 : " It is in the power of
</p>
<p>" the Crown to add any number of members to the House of Peers by
</p>
<p>" raising individuals to the English peerage ; but it may, perhaps, be

</p>
<p>" doubtful whether the King has it in his power to increase the number
</p>
<p>t( of members in the Lower House of Parliament, by empowering an
</p>
<p>" unrepresented town to elect and send members to Parliament. It
</p>
<p>" seems clear that, from the time of Edward IV., until the reign of
</p>
<p>" Charles II., both inclusive, our kings used frequently to assume this
</p>
<p>" right. The last time it is known to have been exercised was in the
</p>
<p>" 29 Car. II., who gave this privilege to Newark ; and on the legal-
</p>
<p>" ity of the grant being then questioned, for the first time, in the
</p>
<p>" House of Commons, it was acknowledged by a majority of 125 to
</p>
<p>" 73." If that prerogative does exist, it is in the power of the
</p>
<p>Crown to dispense with the Act of Union ; for the Sovereign may
</p>
<p>create boroughs now, as before that Act. That book was published
</p>
<p>in the year 1820. Whether that opinion be right or wrong, is Mr.
</p>
<p>Duffy to be punished as a conspirator because he adopted a certain
</p>
<p>opinion of Mr. O'Connell's, not having read sufficiently on the sub-
</p>
<p>ject to know whether that opinion was right or wrong. Suppose Mr.
</p>
<p>537
</p>
<p>Duffy had adopted the opinion of the Attorney or Solicitor-General
</p>
<p>on the subject, instead of that of Mr. O'Connell, would he, there-
</p>
<p>fore, be a conspirator ? 1 will show you by a passage from a speech
</p>
<p>made by Mr. O'Connell, in the debate in the Corporation of Dub-
</p>
<p>lin, that he put this as an extreme case. That speech is in a pamph-
</p>
<p>let, which was most widely scattered, and it was a fair proceeding,
</p>
<p>for it scattered the opinions of my friend, Mr. Butt, who made a most
</p>
<p>able, argumentative, and learned discourse against Mr. O'Connell in
</p>
<p>that debate.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  I do not think you can cite that
</p>
<p>book.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside.  In Home Tooke's case, publications of the pri-
</p>
<p>soner, twelve years before, were allowed to be read in evidence. How-
</p>
<p>ever, I can state the substance of it. Mr. O'Connell said, that to rely
</p>
<p>on the prerogative of the Crown, in the issuing of writs, was putting
</p>
<p>an extreme case, because he knew not any instance, where the peo-
</p>
<p>ple were unanimous, that Parliament had ever refused to grant their
</p>
<p>legitimate request ; and, therefore, he exhorted the Corporation to
</p>
<p>petition, which they did, and the people of Ireland to petition;
</p>
<p>and this led to the mass of petitions that have been prepared. And
</p>
<p>I contend that all these things go to prove that his object was to
</p>
<p>make an impression on Parliament. If he looked to the Crown to
</p>
<p>exercise its prerogative, the meetings and the petitions would be
</p>
<p>useless ; so that all the acts prove that he looked for relief from
</p>
<p>Parliament, and not from the prerogative of the Crown. There
</p>
<p>are two general considerations that I shall advert to, on the subject
</p>
<p>matter of this case : that is, whether the general conduct pursued
</p>
<p>by the defendants showed they were governed by motives that ac-
</p>
<p>tuate men engaged in a conspiracy, and whether the general con-
</p>
<p>duct pursued by the Government showed its members believed the
</p>
<p>traversers were engaged in a conspiracy. How did the defen-
</p>
<p>dants act? Everything they did, everything they wrote, everything
</p>
<p>they spoke was before the public ; every morning their speeches
</p>
<p>appeared in the frigid Sawiders, and at night in the fiery Pilot,

</p>
<p>and they sent up to the Government proof of their guilt, and evi-
</p>
<p>dence for their conviction. They are spoken of openly, and in day-
</p>
<p>light  those dark projects, those treasonable designs, these hidden
</p>
<p>contrivances. The rules of the Association are given to the public ;
</p>
<p>they employed the printer of the Crown to print them ; and they de-
</p>
<p>clared their purpose to be the peaceable organization of the people, to
</p>
<p>concentrate popular opinion, and carry out the objects they had in
</p>
<p>view, and that was legitimate and proper. What was the conduct
</p>
<p>of the Government? Did that Government show that they be-
</p>
<p>lieved that there existed in this country a conspiracy beginning in
</p>
<p>March and ending in October ? If those publications were sedi-
</p>
<p>tious, and proof of a conspiracy ; if they were incentives to rebel-
</p>
<p>lion, and calculated to poison the public mind and infect popular
</p>
<p>feeling in this country, for two whole terms the Court sat in which
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General had the right, by reason of his high sta-
</p>
<p>tion, to take any proceedings he thought proper in the defence of
</p>
<p>3z
</p>
<p>538
</p>
<p>the law and Constitution, on any of those publications that are now-
</p>
<p>asserted to be seditious  why have they not been prosecuted by him ?
</p>
<p>And I retort on him the argument he used, that if it was mischievous
</p>
<p>in those defendants, or any of them, to spread poison through the
</p>
<p>land, it was more mischievous in the champion of the Government,
</p>
<p>the sentinel of the State, not at once to come forward and stop the
</p>
<p>mischief when it might be stopped. Parliament sat until the month
</p>
<p>of August, and I call your attention to the discussion to which the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General referred  the question put by Lord Jocelyn to the
</p>
<p>Minister, and the evasive answer given by that Minister. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, the attention of the Government was also drawn most forcibly
</p>
<p>to the condition of Ireland in Parliament. The Ministry were called
</p>
<p>on to act against the meetings in this country, and they declined. I
</p>
<p>call upon you to recollect, that up to the latter end of August that
</p>
<p>Parliament sat, and nothing was more easy than for this Ministry,
</p>
<p>commanding a majority of that House, to say, We put down the
</p>
<p>Catholic Association by the Statute law, we put down unlawful
</p>
<p>combination, we put down the Protestants of the North, give us
</p>
<p>now only a short Act of Parliament to put down those who dis-
</p>
<p>turb the public peace. They were called upon to do that, and they
</p>
<p>did not do it. They remain quiet until Parliament breaks up ; his
</p>
<p>Excellency, of whom I speak with profound respect, retires from Ire-
</p>
<p>land for recreation, or for the cultivation of those elegant tastes for
</p>
<p>which he is so distinguished ; the Lord Chancellor betakes himself to
</p>
<p>the banks of the Thames, to the charms of Boyle Farm, to muse on
</p>
<p>law or read of Pope ; the noble Secretary for Ireland seeks some quiet
</p>
<p>dell, to lose, if possible, his unclassic recollections of Irish politics;
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General escaped from the bustle of St. Stephen's to the
</p>
<p>tranquillity of home ; the Solicitor- General, calm as ever, is indulging
</p>
<p>in the most agreeable anticipations of the future; the Prime Minister
</p>
<p>is gone to Drayton ; Her Majesty to sea. Ireland is left, in the most
</p>
<p>comfortable manner possible, to go head foremost to destruction. A
</p>
<p>happier arrangement of things could not be made ; life and property
</p>
<p>were consigned to the mercy of the conspirators, and the progress of

<p>the conspiracy advanced unheeded and unchecked. The meeting at
</p>
<p>Clontarf is announced : how shall I describe it ? A black cloud hung
</p>
<p>on the declivities of the mountains ; the political horizon is overcast ;
</p>
<p>a dangerous activity on the part of the Government succeeds a dan-
</p>
<p>gerous silence ; couriers fly to the Irish officials. The Crown lawyers
</p>
<p>prick up their ears and say, here is sedition  where is his Excellency ?
</p>
<p>Here is illegality  where is the Lord Chancellor ? Here is matter
</p>
<p>of political expediency  where is the noble Secretary ? What wel-
</p>
<p>come news they brought who summoned our English functionaries
</p>
<p>to return to the seat of their Irish happiness ! Meanwhile time
</p>
<p>pressed; Mr. Attorney grew ardent, Mr. Solicitor apprehensive;
</p>
<p>they were, I believe, seen together on the sea shore, straining their
</p>
<p>eyes towards the coast of England, and, in the agony of their expec-
</p>
<p>tation, exclaiming :
</p>
<p>" Ye gods, annihilate both time and space,
</p>
<p>And make two lawyers happy.''

</p>
<p>They come, they come  the Privy Council is assembled. I cannot
</p>
<p>tell you, Gentlemen, what passed, or what was said at the first meeting
</p>
<p>of that august body ; the Robertson or Gibbon of future times may
</p>
<p>tell. I'll tell you what they do  they do nothing. The do-no-
</p>
<p>thing policy prevailed, and on Friday they separated, having done
</p>
<p>nothing  with the happy consciousness that they had discharged their
</p>
<p>duty. Refreshed by sleep, they reassembled on Saturday. They
</p>
<p>consider  they compose  they publish ; and the proclamation is
</p>
<p>issued at three o'clock, forbidding the meeting, for which meet-
</p>
<p>ing there were thousands on the march almost at that very mo-
</p>
<p>ment. The Commander-in-Chief receives his order, and pre-
</p>
<p>pares for battle  the cannon are loaded  the bayonets are fixed 
</p>
<p>the cavalry mount, and forth marches our victorious army in
</p>
<p>all " the pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war." It was a
</p>
<p>glorious sight to see. The advanced guard, by a brisk movement,
</p>
<p>pushed on and seized Aldborough House. The light infantry, pro-
</p>
<p>tected by cavalry, rush forward  the guns are placed in position 
</p>
<p>the Pigeon-house, bristling with cannon, looked awful, the police
</p>
<p>skirmished, and the Commander-in-Chief  what did he do ?  all

<p>that Julius Caesar, under similar circumstances, could have done.
</p>
<p>It is stated that Sir Edward Blakeney, at one o'clock, rode down to
</p>
<p>inspect the troops  approved of what was done  rode home, and
</p>
<p>dined ! and if he does not get a peerage for the happy deeds he did
</p>
<p>that day, justice will not be done to Ireland. Such a triumph was
</p>
<p>never achieved since the renowned days of Irish history, when Brian
</p>
<p>Boroihme girded on his mighty sword on his giant thigh and smote
</p>
<p>the Danes. To be more serious, was that a wise, consistent,
</p>
<p>judicious course of policy to make the law understood, respected,
</p>
<p>and obeyed ? Was it not the last policy that should be resorted
</p>
<p>to for the purpose of governing so peculiar a people as the
</p>
<p>Irish ? The meeting at Donnybrook was not forbidden  the Clon-
</p>
<p>tarf meeting was to be put down by the bayonet. Will the intellects
</p>
<p>of the people be much edified by that most interesting docu-
</p>
<p>ment  that learned performance, the proclamation, which was

</p>
<p>fulminated at the very last moment, when the meeting is on the
</p>
<p>point of being held, although other meetings, of the same cha-
</p>
<p>racter and nature, have been endured by that same Govern-
</p>
<p>ment ? Does Irish law vary with the seasons? Is that law in June
</p>
<p>which is not law in October? The Attorney-General said the meet-
</p>
<p>ing at Donnybrook was the type of all the other meetings that were
</p>
<p>held ; and I put it to your own unbiassed reason, if it was  if the
</p>
<p>Government saw the men that went to that meeting passing by the
</p>
<p>Castle gate, and knew it was held, and they read the speeches, if
</p>
<p>they had their Reporters there, and were aware of everything that
</p>
<p>passed, why not then put down that and similar meetings ? Heated,
</p>
<p>inflamed, they see an enthusiastic people in pursuit of a darling object.
</p>
<p>Which are the most blameable, the people for holding those meetings
</p>
<p>that they did not see denounced or put down by the' law, or the Mi-
</p>
<p>nistry, that stood by and witnessed the folly and knew of the madness,
</p>
<p>540
</p>
<p>yet allowed the mischief to prevail and spread over the country, until it
</p>
<p>was ready to burstforth, volcano-like, in a fiery torrent. If you con-
</p>
<p>vict my client, you convict the Government. If you desire to acquit
</p>
<p>the Government, you must acquit my client. These Ministers are
</p>
<p>chosen by Her Majesty to govern this great empire ; the peace of the
</p>
<p>country is intrusted to them ; your lives and property, it is asserted,
</p>
<p>are in jeopardy ; they say a black conspiracy has existed in this country
</p>
<p>since the month of March, that they knew it, and were aware of every
</p>
<p>act done in pursuance of that conspiracy ; yet they did nothing to put
</p>
<p>it down; they allowed the seditious speeches to be made and
</p>
<p>published ; they read them ; they noted them ; they let them pass ;
</p>
<p>they took no proceedings ; they asked no aid from Parliament ; and
</p>
<p>now they want to disengage themselves clear, by commencing this
</p>
<p>unprecedented prosecution, by charging these men with an illegal act.
</p>
<p>In the ordinary course of human affairs, the most powerful and con-
</p>
<p>clusive admissions will be drawn from the conduct of parties, but in
</p>
<p>cases of political conspiracy between the Crown and the subject,
</p>
<p>it is for you to take care, and great care, that it should not be in
</p>
<p>the power of the Government to-day to say, by their conduct, as sig-
</p>
<p>nificant as their acts and declarations, a certain thing is lawful, and
</p>
<p>not to be censured  and then to draw together all the incautious lan-
</p>
<p>guage, all the violence of public men, for a period often months, in
</p>
<p>one indictment, to overload the memory, and confuse the understand-
</p>
<p>ing, by the mass of paper upon the table ; and to tell twelve honest
</p>
<p>men, who are governed by no other desire than to do justice, to
</p>
<p>spell out of the whole a black conspiracy to subvert the monarchy
</p>
<p>and uproot the Constitution that you have sworn to protect. I take the
</p>
<p>liberty to say this, that it is impossible for you to believe, nor do
</p>
<p>I believe that the learned gentlemen I see before me ever thought
</p>
<p>there was a conspiracy. I do not believe they thought the conduct
</p>
<p>complained of amounted to a conspiracy. They did not, during all
</p>
<p>that time, prosecute for a conspiracy. Was the understanding of the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General less acute  was the Solicitor-General less anxious  
</p>
<p>were they reluctant to tell the Government to discharge their duty ?

</p>
<p>No ; they are honourable gentlemen both ; they do credit to the
</p>
<p>Government that selected them for their important functions, and
</p>
<p>there are not two men in the Hall that would more honestly and
</p>
<p>frankly express any opinion they were called upon to give. They
</p>
<p>did not advise the Government to act. The Government did not act,
</p>
<p>because they did not believe a conspiracy to exist. It now remains
</p>
<p>for me to say but a few words in reference to the particular acts charged
</p>
<p>against my client, Mr. Duffy. He is the proprietor of a weekly
</p>
<p>journal, and is prosecuted here for no private calumny, for no slander
</p>
<p>on private virtue, integrity, or honour. He has not invaded the peace
</p>
<p>of families, or sought to gain a base notoriety by blackening the re-
</p>
<p>putation of those from whom he differed. He is accused hereto-day
</p>
<p>for the terms in which he advocated a great public question. That he
</p>
<p>had a right to advocate and discuss his own view of the Repeal of
</p>
<p>the Union cannot be denied; he might do so ardently, boldly, vehe-
</p>
<p>541
</p>
<p>mently. Reflect on the position in which such a writer stands. He
</p>
<p>is, as the law stands, encompassed with quite enough of difficulty and
</p>
<p>of danger; forced, from the necessity of his profession, to engage
</p>
<p>from day to day in the discussion of angry topics, on which public
</p>
<p>feeling is inflamed ; forced to report and notice what is passing be-
</p>
<p>fore his eyes, else his paper would not be a newspaper, and obliged
</p>
<p>to comment on what is passing, promptly, and without reserve. If he
</p>
<p>is deficient in spirit, the public will not read his paper ; if extrava-
</p>
<p>gant, the Attorney-General threatens, and sometimes the doors of
</p>
<p>the Queen's Bench open for his admission, whence he cannot retire
</p>
<p>as comfortably and as quietly as he might wish. Further, he is
</p>
<p>responsible for the acts of all who write a political squib or a spicy
</p>
<p>article for his paper, and for his almost involuntary acts. And if a
</p>
<p>poetic youth, within the walls of a College, sends a clever song to the
</p>
<p>compositor, to fill a corner, even the poetry, however harmonious,
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General intermixes with the horrible prose of the in-
</p>
<p>dictment ; nay, more, the proprietor is liable, though absent, for the
</p>
<p>sins of others, although he has committed none himself. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>this situation is difficult and critical enough, without adding to its
</p>
<p>dangers. The accusation against Mr. Duffy is, that he has em-
</p>
<p>barked in the wicked conspiracy spread on the face of this indict-
</p>
<p>ment, and you are to collect, by an inference of reason, that he
</p>
<p>has made himself, by the acts he has done, a conspirator, guilty
</p>
<p>of the precise conspiracy charged in the indictment. 1 deny
</p>
<p>there is any general conspiracy, and I have endeavoured to prove
</p>
<p>that there was none. If there was, secondly, I deny Mr. Duffy to
</p>
<p>have been a party to any such conspiracy. His acts establish nothing
</p>
<p>criminal against him. He is a Repealer, but that does not entitle
</p>
<p>this Court to deprive him of his liberty or his fortune. Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell is also a Repealer ; that fact does not prove that he and Mr.
</p>
<p>Duffy have conspired to effect Repeal in the manner charged. Well,
</p>
<p>then, what has Mr. Duffy done ? The charge against him is divided
</p>
<p>into two heads, the reports of proceedings published by him, and the
</p>
<p>original articles and observations upon them. With respect to the
</p>

</p>
<p>reports, I apprehend that you cannot find him guilty of any charge of
</p>
<p>conspiracy. He reprinted in his weekly paper, though not at such a
</p>
<p>length, the reports of proceedings for the previous week, compiled
</p>
<p>from perhaps ten or a dozen other journals in which they originally
</p>
<p>appeared. These were matters which it was desirable the public
</p>
<p>should know, which it was desirable the Government of England
</p>
<p>should know, and what was he to do ? If he did not publish them
</p>
<p>in his paper, no one would buy it. Is he more guilty of reporting
</p>
<p>such meetings than the Evening Mail, or the Evening Packet, or
</p>
<p>Saunders, or the Warder? Therefore, Gentlemen, so far as the
</p>
<p>reports go, I do not think you can find him guilty as a conspirator.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General himself admitted this, for he said that my
</p>
<p>client used his newspaper, not to circulate news, hut as an engine of
</p>
<p>the Association to forward the conspiracy. He therefore admitted,
</p>
<p>that merely narrating or publishing the news of the day would not
</p>
<p>542
</p>
<p>make him a conspirator. Why the business of a newspaper must be
</p>
<p>stopped altogether if such a proposition could be for a moment lis-
</p>
<p>tened tfl.
</p>
<p>The remaining question, then, is as to the original publications,
</p>
<p>which, I admit, suggest other considerations, which I shall take the
</p>
<p>liberty of bringing under your notice. The Attorney-General pro-
</p>
<p>poses to establish the crime of conspiracy, by picking out three or
</p>
<p>four articles, published at different periods, and suggested by pass-
</p>
<p>ing events, culled from the publications in a weekly newspaper, ex-
</p>
<p>tending over a period of nine months, and read to the Court as being
</p>
<p>calculated to prejudice the minds of the people against the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment of England; and, observe, that all the intervening quotations,
</p>
<p>which might qualify or explain them, are passed over, although the
</p>
<p>learned gentleman ferreted out everything else that could serve his
</p>
<p>purposes, whether in large type or in small. The song on which
</p>
<p>they rely is entitled, "The Memory of the Dead," and was published
</p>
<p>in the Nation, on the 1st of April, 1843. A very proper day for the
</p>
<p>publication of that which is now selected by the Crown as evidence
</p>
<p>of a conspiracy. And suppose it was, in the words of the indictment,
</p>
<p>" an incentive to rebellion," why was not the publisher of that sedi-
</p>
<p>tious song at once brought into Court, and dealt with for it ? But no-
</p>
<p>thing is done until it is forgotten, and at the eve of eight months, a song
</p>
<p>printed in the Nation is stuffed into the indictment. What is most un-
</p>
<p>accountable with respect to its appearance there is, that there is no
</p>
<p>averment whatever respecting that song, except that Mr. Duffy pub-
</p>
<p>lished it. The indictment does not tell you what it relates to. What
</p>
<p>'98 does it refer to? or how does he connect it with the subject mat-
</p>
<p>ter of this conspiracy ? There is not a word of prefatory matter to
</p>
<p>explain what it refers to. I want to know by what right you are called
</p>
<p>upon to presume, in a criminal case, that it refers to 1798, any more
</p>
<p>than to 1698, or 1598, or 1498. The expression 1798 does not occur
</p>
<p>in the song from the beginning to the end. Why, then, I again ask,
</p>
<p>is a criminal intent to be fastened upon any man without even the
</p>
<p>form of an averment to give an application to what he writes or pub-

</p>
<p>lishes? Are you to visit this act of Mr. Duffy's on Mr. O'Connell,
</p>
<p>or to presume that it was published in pursuance of a common plan
</p>
<p>between traversers ? That song was written by some clever young
</p>
<p>man, and I took the liberty of reading to you another song published
</p>
<p>in the same paper on the same day, and which it was certainly as
</p>
<p>agreeable to hear as many of Mr. Attorney-General's statements.
</p>
<p>These very sweet, agreeable verses were read from the very same
</p>
<p>paper. Are you to be asked to believe that Mr. O'Connell and Mr.
</p>
<p>Steele knew beforehand, by reason of a common plan, and an union
</p>
<p>of purpose, that some young man, perhaps within the walls of Trinity
</p>
<p>College, animated with that poetic fire which illuminated his ima-
</p>
<p>ginative soul, would write that song and send it to the compositor of
</p>
<p>the Nation, to fill up a corner in his paper? Are you to believe that
</p>
<p>all this was done in pursuance of a common object, and in further-
</p>
<p>ance of a conspiracy ? Is it come to this, that the government of Eng-
</p>
<p>543
</p>
<p>land is not safe  that the Constitution of England is in danger, because
</p>
<p>some young man, gifted as the writer of that song unquestionably
</p>
<p>was, adverted, in poetic language, to the mistaken views of men who
</p>
<p>lived in former days ? or will any twelve honest, or intelligent, or
</p>
<p>experienced men, be asked to found a verdict on such grounds ?
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, it is not fair, it is not generous thus to take a young man
</p>
<p>to task for the ardent and warm-bearted effusions of his early youth.
</p>
<p>The writer, who, in my opinion, has, by his writings, done more
</p>
<p>than any other author to uphold our social system, to mend the
</p>
<p>morals and improve the mind, Robert Southey himself commenced
</p>
<p>his career by writing that memorable work, Wat Tyler, but the tone
</p>
<p>and temper of his mind were changed when a sounder judgment, and
</p>
<p>more extensive knowledge of the world taught him to view men and
</p>
<p>systems by the calm light of cool, dispassionate reason. Alas ! Mr.
</p>
<p>Solicitor, am I to be told that it is worthy of a wise and enligh-
</p>
<p>tened Government to bear down a state prosecution upon the
</p>
<p>writer of that enthusiastic little song, written with the ardour of
</p>
<p>thoughtless youth, and that too after the lapse of nine months from
</p>
<p>the time of its composition !
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, in the disastrous and criminal movement of '98,
</p>
<p>amongst the most prominent of the leaders were two ill-fated members
</p>
<p>of my own Profession  Henry and John Shears. In a review which
</p>
<p>recentlyappeared in a respectable literary publication, the Athenoeum,
</p>
<p>of a number of the " Life and Writings of the late William Taylor,
</p>
<p>of Norwich," I find this remarkable fact noticed, that the first letter
</p>
<p>of along correspondence between Taylor and Southey, transmits an
</p>
<p>elegy on the fate of these unhappy young men. I will read for vou
</p>
<p>an extract from the review in the Athenaeum : " In 1798 William
</p>
<p>" Taylor became acquainted with Robert Southey, then rising into
</p>
<p>" fame, and a correspondence ensued between them which extended
</p>
<p>" for many years. It is singular that Taylor's first letter should
</p>
<p>" transmit an elegy on the fate of Henry and John Shears, who had
</p>
<p>" just been executed for high treason in Dublin ; Taylor celebrates
</p>
<p>" them as martyred patriots. The passage in which their mother

<p>" is introduced bidding them farewell in the dungeon will give a ge-
</p>
<p>" neral notion of the spirit which pervades the whole :
</p>
<p>" Sons, 'twas for this I bore you  die as men,
</p>
<p>To whom your father's country, and your offspring
</p>
<p>Deserved to owe the good
</p>
<p>Ye struggled to obtain.
</p>
<p>Thy wife, son, cannot speak  she loves thy children ;
</p>
<p>And in her poverty shall thank her God,
</p>
<p>That thou hast boldly dared
</p>
<p>Devote them for thy country.
</p>
<p>Thou needest, John, thy mother's counsel not.
</p>
<p>If the few weeks that ere we meet roll by,
</p>
<p>Worthy of thee I spend,
</p>
<p>"Well pleased mine eyes shall close."
</p>
<p>544
</p>
<p>And, Gentlemen, am I to be told that the man who penned that
</p>
<p>touching verse is to be branded for ever more as a conspirator, be-
</p>
<p>cause he commiserated' the unhappy end of any ardent and misguided
</p>
<p>men who loved their country, " not wisely, but too well ?" No,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, such a proceeding would be scandalous and disgraceful ;
</p>
<p>and equally unworthy is it of the great and distinguished Government
</p>
<p>which prosecutes in the present instance, to direct the thunders of
</p>
<p>their indignation against the enthusiastic young author of the " Me-
</p>
<p>mory of the Dead." Let the Solicitor-General tell how the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment of England punished Mr. Moore for poems not a whit less
</p>
<p>indicative of conspiracy (if conspiracy indeed there be) than the
</p>
<p>stanzas which have been read to you. Let him tell you how Moore
</p>
<p>was punished for writing such lines as these in his " Lamentation of
</p>
<p>Aughrim :"
</p>
<p>" Could the chain for an instant be riven
</p>
<p>"Which Tyranny flung round us then,
</p>
<p>Oh ! 'tis not in man nor in heaven
</p>
<p>To let Tyranny bind it again.
</p>
<p>" But 'tis past; and though blazoned in story
</p>
<p>The name of our victor may be,
</p>
<p>Accursed is the march of the glory
</p>
<p>"Which treads o'er the hearts of the free."
</p>
<p>Let him tell you how the bard was punished for penning the song of
</p>
<p>" Ruark, Prince of Breffny," and of inserting in it such lines as
</p>
<p>these :
</p>
<p>" Already the curse is upon her,
</p>
<p>And strangers her valleys profane :
</p>
<p>They come to divide  to dishonour ;
</p>
<p>And tyrants they long will remain.
</p>
<p>But onward !  the green banner rearing,
</p>
<p>Go flesh every sword to the hilt :
</p>
<p>On our side is Virtue and Erin ;
</p>
<p>On theirs is the Saxon and Guilt."
</p>
<p>Yes, Gentlemen, the author of the " Adventures of an Irish Gentleman

<p>in Search of a Religion," and of the " Memoirs of Lord Edward Fitz-
</p>
<p>gerald," was punished. But how was he punished? He was punish-
</p>
<p>ed by a pension from the English Government ; yes, Moore was
</p>
<p>punished with a pension ; and you, Gentlemen of the Jury, are now
</p>
<p>solicited to bring a verdict of " guilty" against the writer of this
</p>
<p>song, and to declare your conviction that the emanation of a mind,
</p>
<p>young, ardent, poetical, and imaginative, though mistaken, was in
</p>
<p>furtherance of a common plan and design of the most infamous
</p>
<p>nature ! However ardent the youth of Ireland may be, it should
</p>
<p>never be forgotten of them that they never forgot their loyalty to
</p>
<p>their Sovereign ; even when in 1715 and 1 745 the best blood of England
</p>
<p>and of Scotland bedewed the scaffold, in consequence of the mad,
</p>
<p>and well-nigh successful attempt to dislodge the present royal fa-
</p>
<p>mily from the throne of these countries, the Irish were faithful
</p>
<p>545
</p>
<p>lo the Sovereign. Are not the subjects of a free state to be per-
</p>
<p>mitted to raise their voices in constitutional protestations and re-
</p>
<p>monstrance, when they think that their interests are endangered
</p>
<p>or injured ? Scott was once called upon to decide between his
</p>
<p>attachment to his party and his love of Scotland. The British mi-
</p>
<p>nistry declared their intention to introduce  regardless of the feel-
</p>
<p>ings of the Scottish people, who considered that their interests
</p>
<p>were vitally affected by it  a bill in reference to the joint stock
</p>
<p>banks of Scotland, The Scotch thought that they would be injured
</p>
<p>by the contemplated bill; and Sir Walter Scott, fired with indigna-
</p>
<p>tion at the idea that the Act should be introduced without consulting
</p>
<p>the wishes and feelings of his countrymen, wrote, under the signa-
</p>
<p>ture of " Malachi Malagrowther," a series of letters, which excited
</p>
<p>such aflame of indignation in the country from North to South, from
</p>
<p>East to West, that the Minister of the Crown was obliged to fly away
</p>
<p>with his obnoxious bill under his arm, just as the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>will be forced to fly with his monster indictment. Did any one
</p>
<p>presume to prosecute Sir Walter Scott for that ? No. What then
</p>
<p>was the result? The Scotch succeeded, and the English Minister
</p>
<p>was obliged to give them their rights. But was that done in a cold,
</p>
<p>servile manner ? Do you think that they would have succeeded if
</p>
<p>they had merely remonstrated with the Minister? if they had said
</p>
<p>to him : " Sir Robert, do listen to us, we respectfully submit," as we
</p>
<p>lawyers say in addressing the Bench. Not he; he went boldly
</p>
<p>about the task, and he succeeded in making his country, which
</p>
<p>contained about one quarter of the number of inhabitants that Ireland
</p>
<p>did  he succeeded in making his country happy, respectable, and
</p>
<p>great, while we are degraded to a poor, pitiful, paltry province. I
</p>
<p>am not ashamed or afraid to say this. I trust the time will come,
</p>
<p>when the Irish people will combine to have their common grievances
</p>
<p>redressed, and, for the common good of their country  the good of
</p>
<p>this ancient kingdom, that she may once again flourish,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I now come to the evidence, to prove a serious charge
</p>
<p>of the indictment ; and what do you think the Attorney-General relied

<p>on part of it for ? Why a letter in the Nation newspaper, signed " A
</p>
<p>Delcassian." Delcassian, treason of course. This letter has reference
</p>
<p>to one of the lakes in Ireland, called Lake Belvidere. It says, " We
</p>
<p>" don't want lakes at all ; let us have loughs, and then it will look like
</p>
<p>" Irish. We want no Italian or German names at all ; let us have
</p>
<p>" Irish names." And it further stated that Roderick, one of the last
</p>
<p>Kings of Ireland, died on an island in that lake. But I cannot see any-
</p>
<p>thing very wrong in that; and I venture to assert, that if every reader
</p>
<p>of the Nation in existence was putupon the table, and asked," Do you
</p>
<p>" remember the letter of 'The Delcassian,'" he would say, "On my oath
</p>
<p>I do not remember a word about it." And that is a part of the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy charged in the indictment, and sought to be palmed on you as
</p>
<p>treason, along with Ollam Fodhla, and the other old gentleman who lived
</p>
<p>4a
</p>
<p>546
</p>
<p>in his days. That is one part of the charge ; and now come to that
</p>
<p>which they rely on for a conviction. The subject is from the same
</p>
<p>paper, the Nation, of the 27th of April. It is headed, " Something
</p>
<p>" is coming", aye, for good or ill, something is coming." [Mr.
</p>
<p>Whiteside read the article, see ante, page 71.] It says, " Coolness is
</p>
<p>the only thing." Anything, I ask, inflammatory in advising the people
</p>
<p>to be cool and steady ? 1 can't see there is, although the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General wishes you to believe that there is. "The people are sober now."
</p>
<p>I submit there is nothing of conspiracy in that. " Let them be kind
</p>
<p>" and conciliating to the Protestants."  Neither can I see anything
</p>
<p>in that ; but every person don't view things in the same light as
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General does. I do not think it is wrong in a writer to
</p>
<p>endeavour to conciliate Protestants, because he well knew that there
</p>
<p>were 800,000 good Presbyterians in the North of Ireland, who
</p>
<p>were strong-minded, who reasoned well, and who, once they took
</p>
<p>up a subject, and were convinced of the utility of it, would not
</p>
<p>cease until their object was accomplished. The writer knew the dif-
</p>
<p>ficulty of getting these men out, and therefore he wanted to conciliate
</p>
<p>them. I don't see anything wrong in that; and their assistance would
</p>
<p>be valuable to the Repeal cause ; and, let me ask, what other mode
</p>
<p>could be adopted ? It was recommended by Mr. O'Connell; it was re-
</p>
<p>commended by Sir Walter Scott, and with effect ; and the traversers are
</p>
<p>to be convicted of a conspiracy, because the writer in the Nation en-
</p>
<p>deavoured to conciliate his Protestant brethren. The Nation says they
</p>
<p>differ from Mr. O'Connell ; and is that a sign of conspiracy ? I say
</p>
<p>the newspapers do not speak the sentiments of the Association, and
</p>
<p>therefore there is no conspiracy between its members and the editor.
</p>
<p>The next article he relied on, is the article headed "Our Nationality;"
</p>
<p>a thing which will always be objected to by our brethren on the other
</p>
<p>side of the water, or at least by the Government. [Mr. Whiteside
</p>
<p>read the article, see ante, p. 74.] Mr. Barrett has also used the
</p>
<p>word " clutched" in a speech made by him. " Oh," says Mr. Barrett,
</p>
<p>we shall be the devil for thinking, like the old woman's cow." And
</p>
<p>then, forthwith, the Attorney-General put the " old woman's cow"

</p>
<p>into the indictment. " Until we clutch"  What ? The Queen ? No.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice ? No. The Attorney-General? No ; but our "in-
</p>
<p>dependence." I ask you, is this to be brought up in judgment
</p>
<p>against the defendant? I will ask any one man of you, if he were
</p>
<p>on his oath, has he not read worse articles in the English papers,
</p>
<p>calculated to irritate the people of England, and inflame their minds ;
</p>
<p>none of which were prosecuted, but passed by and forgotten. The
</p>
<p>advertisement about the Clontarf meeting was not what it should be
</p>
<p> it was most objectionable; but it was immediately repudiated and
</p>
<p>withdrawn. I have shown you that the true object ofthatdocument in the
</p>
<p>Nation was that there should be a grand procession to Clontarf. At the
</p>
<p>request of some Protestant clergymen it was given up, as it was the
</p>
<p>Sabbath Day, and the time of divine service, and even the streets
</p>
<p>were avoided in which places of worship were. I rely on this to show that
</p>
<p>547
</p>
<p>no offence was intended ; but as they had proceeded in a procession to
</p>
<p>Donny brook, they considered that they might do so to Clontarf.
</p>
<p>There is hut one article more I shall trouble you with ; but I
</p>
<p>must remark that 1 cannot approve of the unjust and intemperate
</p>
<p>observations which were sometimes made upon the English nation;
</p>
<p>for they, a great, free, virtuous, and magnanimous people  they have
</p>
<p>gained freedom for themselves, and have given to the world proofs of
</p>
<p>their enterprize and spirit. It is, however, to be regretted that the
</p>
<p>practical good sense, which pre-eminently mark their character, did
</p>
<p>not induce them in past times to lqok narrowly into the condition of
</p>
<p>this country, and to do that justice to Ireland which the Government
</p>
<p>of England and the monopolists by whom they were surrounded and
</p>
<p>controlled refused to do. Perhaps something may be ascribed to
</p>
<p>prejudice ; more to the narrow views, entertained on questions of po-
</p>
<p>litical science and of trade and commerce, by most men at the period
</p>
<p>referred to, and, I must say, more to the reprehensible ignorance of
</p>
<p>rhe circumstances and feelings of the Irish people which prevailed,
</p>
<p>even amongst educated Englishmen till a later and happier era.
</p>
<p>These, combined with other causes, spoiled the happiness and checked
</p>
<p>the prosperity of Ireland ; but that Englishmen take delight in cru-
</p>
<p>elty or injustice would not be believed in the most barbarous climes,
</p>
<p>and ought not to be believed or asserted here. Gentlemen, respect-
</p>
<p>ing the dreadful scenes which, within the memory of living men,
</p>
<p>and the former scenes, more dreadful still, recorded in the page of
</p>
<p>history, which have been enacted in Ireland, and adverted to in some
</p>
<p>of the speeches and publications before the Court, I should, rather than
</p>
<p>revive the recollection of their horrors, exclaim in the words of Lord
</p>
<p>Coke : " Let oblivion bury them or silence cover them ;" the moralist
</p>
<p>weeps, the patriot trembles, the philanthropist despairs of the im-
</p>
<p>provement of his species, while they contemplate such terrible pas-
</p>
<p>sages in the history of mankind. To bring these shocking events
</p>
<p>before the public eye can answer but one good purpose  to hold out
</p>
<p>to us who live in better days, a warning to shun the madness and
</p>
<p>crimes of our forefathers, and a lesson to repress the evil passions

</p>
<p>which led to their perpetration. To all Governments such awful trans-
</p>
<p>actions hold out a solemn admonition of the errors committed by the
</p>
<p>ruling powers in times past, to the end that similar errors might be
</p>
<p>avoided for the time to come, and remedies, if possible, discovered for
</p>
<p>the miserable consequences of misgovernment and neglect. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men of the Jury, I have no more to say upon that part of the case.
</p>
<p>I admit that strong language has been used, and I regret it. The
</p>
<p>term " Saxon" has been applied to Englishmen. Mr. O'Connell has
</p>
<p>entirely renounced it at the request of an English gentleman : I be-
</p>
<p>lieve he borrowed it from Mr. Moore. Moore was wrong to have
</p>
<p>used it. Yet, probably, when the trials are over, if I called upon
</p>
<p>the learned Solicitor-General, I would find " Moore's Melodies," and
</p>
<p>" The Irish Gentleman in Search of a Religion," upon his table ;
</p>
<p>yet, perhaps, if he knew who knocked at the door, he would, like the
</p>
<p>548
</p>
<p>lady in the play, thrust one into a drawer, and put the other under
</p>
<p>the table, and put " The whole Duty of Man" in its piace.
</p>
<p>The last document to which I shall refer is, "The Morality of War,"
</p>
<p>which the Attorney-General has dwelt upon so eloquently, and transla-
</p>
<p>ted with not a little freedom into "The Morality of Rebellion." It seems
</p>
<p>that from the first moment it met his eye it startled his legal mind.
</p>
<p>But if it was the dreadful article he appears to have believed it to be,
</p>
<p>it astonishes me that he did not at once run off with it to the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment, and exclaim, " I will forthwith file an information in the
</p>
<p>Queen's Bench against the author." I request your attention to it.
</p>
<p>It states that a communication was received through Mr. Haughton
</p>
<p>from a Mr. Ebenezer Shackelton, expostulating for having the words
</p>
<p>Benburb, Clontarf, &c, upon the Repeal card. Now, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>do you think the traversers combined together, that Mr. Ebenezer
</p>
<p>Shackelton should write that letter? Quakers, Gentlemen, are a
</p>
<p>class of men who proclaim a dislike of war, but are very anxious to
</p>
<p>live under the benefits derived from it. I remember the story of a
</p>
<p>Quaker, which I will tell you. He was on board a ship which was
</p>
<p>attacked by pirates, and boarded. One of them came rather closely
</p>
<p>to the man of peace  and he seized him round the body, exclaiming
</p>
<p>very gently, " My principles will not allow me to shoot or cut thee
</p>
<p>down ; but, friend, thou hast no business here," and he peaceably
</p>
<p>dropped him overboard. Gentlemen, in my young days I was called
</p>
<p>upon by a Quaker to second a resolution at a meeting of the Friends
</p>
<p>of peace, and I could not repress my laughter when he produced at
</p>
<p>the meeting an immense roll of parchment, which he said contained
</p>
<p>the names of every one who had fallen in battle from the days of
</p>
<p>Alexander to the battle of Navarino. How is it, Gentlemen, that
</p>
<p>because Mr. Ebenezer Shackelton, through Mr. Haughton, writes
</p>
<p>this letter to the Nation, that Mr. O'Connell and Mr. Steele should
</p>
<p>suffer for it ? I call your attention to this passage : " We feel no
</p>
<p>" wish to encourage the vocations of war; but whenever the occasion
</p>
<p>" comes here or elsewhere, many sagacious and informed souls, bold
</p>
<p>" and strong arms, will be found to plan, lead, and fight ; may

</p>
<p>" the examples of Miltiades and Washington never want imitators
</p>
<p>" where there are tyrants to invade, freemen to defend, or slaves to
</p>
<p>" struggle for liberty." This is the article, Gentlemen, which the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General has brought you to pronounce a verdict upon. I
</p>
<p>defend that sentiment  it is noble  worthy of a generous and enthu-
</p>
<p>siastic nature. Has the time arrived when the ardent mind of youth
</p>
<p>may no longer dwell on the virtues of a great hero of antiquity who
</p>
<p>saved his country, or of the greater hero of modern times whose illustri-
</p>
<p>ous life is an example useful for liberty and civilization for ever. I will
</p>
<p>not compare Washington with the vulgar tyrants who have insulted
</p>
<p>or enslaved the world, with the insatiable ambition of Napoleon, or the
</p>
<p>deep hypocrisy and black treachery of Cromwell. The simple gran-
</p>
<p>deur of his nature obscures the splendour of antiquity, and our minds
</p>
<p>549
</p>
<p>are filled with admiration for his moral greatness and transcendant
</p>
<p>virtue. But that he lived under a diviner dispensation, we might
</p>
<p>have supposed his felicity hereafter to have been that ascribed by the
</p>
<p>poet to Cato, being surrounded by the spirits of departed virtue, and
</p>
<p>giving laws to the assembled just ; and even now, it may not be pre-
</p>
<p>sumptuous to believe it may be a portion of his unspeakable felicity
</p>
<p>to behold from his habitation in the skies the results of his illustrious
</p>
<p>labours here on earth. America has been frequently referred to in
</p>
<p>the papers read to the jury, and the reference dwelt on to the pre-
</p>
<p>judice of the traversers. England has no reason to fear comparison
</p>
<p>with America or her institutions. I prefer the system under which
</p>
<p>we live ; but I am shocked in contemplating the absurd caricatures of
</p>
<p>America drawn by the popular writers of the day. Considering what
</p>
<p>America is and what she was, I exclaim with the Roman historian,
</p>
<p>" Civitas incredibile memoratu est, adepta libertate, quantum brevi
</p>
<p>crcnerit." A political writer may corrupt the public taste, deprave
</p>
<p>the morals of society, and lavish praises on the character of the
</p>
<p>Eighth Henry, the profligate Charles, or the bigot James, and may
</p>
<p>hold out as examples of virtue a Domitian and a Nero, and he is safe.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General will never prosecute such offences against good
</p>
<p>taste or truth ; but if the same writer ventures to celebrate the bene-
</p>
<p>factors of mankind, the Attorney-General will prosecute the author
</p>
<p>as guilty of sedition against the State.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the whole case is now before you, and is emphati-
</p>
<p>cally for your decision. You have seen the many instances where
</p>
<p>the crime of conspiracy was attempted to be fastened on Englishmen,
</p>
<p>in which English juries refused to concur. In that terrible book
</p>
<p>containing the State Trials of England, where the real history of that
</p>
<p>country is written, there are many instances of truth stifled, justice
</p>
<p>scoffed, and innocence struck down. On the other hand, there are
</p>
<p>memorable examples of victims rescued from oppression by the
</p>
<p>honesty and courage of British juries. Hardy, who discussed the
</p>
<p>great question of Parliamentary Reform, thus was saved ; thus was
</p>
<p>rescued Home Tooke ; with their conviction freedom of discussion

</p>
<p>might have perished. At an earlier period still, in the days of the
</p>
<p>Second James, when the seven Bishops were accused of conspiracy
</p>
<p>for asserting the rights of Englishmen, a jury delivered a verdict of
</p>
<p>acquittal, and the shouts of joy with which it was received proclaimed
</p>
<p>your freedom. Even in the days of Cromwell, after he had waded
</p>
<p>through slaughter to a throne, and under the sacred names of Liberty
</p>
<p>and Religion trampled upon both, the tyrant found the virtue of a
</p>
<p>jury to be beyond his power. The forms of justice he dare not
</p>
<p>abolish while an Englishman lived ; and we have it upon record,
</p>
<p>that when in the plenitude of his power he prosecuted for a libel
</p>
<p>upon himself, there were twelve honest men to be found who had
</p>
<p>the courage to pronounce a verdict of not guilty, thus proving 
</p>
<p>I quote the words of a patriot lawyer, who, in reference to that
</p>
<p>550
</p>
<p>immortal precedent, exclaimed: "When all seemed lost, the un-
</p>
<p>" conquerable spirit of English liberty survived in the hearts of
</p>
<p>" English jurors." Gentlemen, the true object of this prose-
</p>
<p>cution is to put down the freedom of discussion of a great pub-
</p>
<p>lic question. Viewed in this light all other considerations sink
</p>
<p>into insignificance. Its importance becomes vast indeed. A na-
</p>
<p>tion's rights are involved in the issue ; a nation's liberties are
</p>
<p>at stake ; that won, what preserves the precious privileges you
</p>
<p>possess ? The exercise of the right of political discussion  free,
</p>
<p>untrammelled, bold. The laws which wisdom framed  the institu-
</p>
<p>tions struck out by patriotism, learning, or genius  can they pre-
</p>
<p>serve the springs of freedom fresh and pure ? No ; destroy the right
</p>
<p>of free discussion, and you dry up the sources of freedom. By the
</p>
<p>same means by which your liberties were won can they be increased
</p>
<p>or defended. Quarrel not with the partial evils free discussion
</p>
<p>creates, nor seek to contract the enjoyment of that greatest privilege
</p>
<p>within the narrow limits timid men can prescribe. With the passing
</p>
<p>mischiefs of its extravagance, contrast the prodigious blessings it has
</p>
<p>heaped on man. Free discussion aroused the human mind from the
</p>
<p>torpor of ages; taught it to think, and shook the thrones of ignorance
</p>
<p>and darkness. Free discussion gave to Europe the Reformation,
</p>
<p>which 1 have been taught to believe the mightiest event in the history
</p>
<p>of the human race; illuminated the world with the radiant light of
</p>
<p>spiritual truth. May it shine with steady and increasing splendour!
</p>
<p>Free discussion gave to England the Revolution, abolished tyranny,
</p>
<p>swept away the monstrous abuses it rears, and established the liber-
</p>
<p>ties under which we live. Free discussion, since that glorious epoch,
</p>
<p>has not only preserved but purified our Constitution, reformed our
</p>
<p>laws, reduced our punishments, and extended its wholesome influence
</p>
<p>to every portion of our political system. The spirit of inquiry it
</p>
<p>creates has revealed the secrets of nature ; explained the wonders of
</p>
<p>creation, teaching the knowledge of the stupendous works of God.
</p>
<p>Arts, science, civilization, freedom, pure religion are its noble reali-
</p>
<p>ties. Would you undo the labours of science, extinguish literature,

</p>
<p>stop the efforts of genius, restore ignorance, bigotry, barbarism, then
</p>
<p>put down free discussion, and you have accomplished all. Savage
</p>
<p>conquerors, in the blindness of their ignorance, have scattered and
</p>
<p>destroyed the intellectual treasures of a great antiquity. Those who
</p>
<p>make war on the sacred right of free discussion, without their igno-
</p>
<p>rance imitate their fury. They may check the expression of some
</p>
<p>thought, which might, if uttered, redeem the liberties or increase the
</p>
<p>happiness of man. The insidious assailants of this great prerogative
</p>
<p>of intellectual beings, by the cover under which they advance, con-
</p>
<p>ceal the character of their assault upon the liberties of the human
</p>
<p>race. They seem to admit the liberty to discuss, blame only its ex-
</p>
<p>travagance, pronounce hollow praises on the value of freedom of
</p>
<p>speech, and straightway begin a prosecution to cripple or destroy it.
</p>
<p>The open despot avows his object is to oppress or to enslave; resist-
</p>
<p>551
</p>
<p>ancG is certain to encounter his tyranny, and perhaps subvert it. Not
</p>
<p>so the artful assailant of a nation's rights, he declares friendship while
</p>
<p>lie wages war, and professes affection for the thing he hates. State
</p>
<p>prosecutors, if you believe them, are ever the fastest friends of free-
</p>
<p>dom. They tell you peace is disturbed, order broken, by the excesses
</p>
<p>of turbulent and seditious demagogues. No doubt there might be a
</p>
<p>seeming peace  a deathlike stillness  by repressing the feelings and
</p>
<p>passions of men. So in the fairest portions of Europe this day, there
</p>
<p>are peace, and order, and submission, under paternal despotism, ec-
</p>
<p>clesiastical and civil. That peace springs from terror, that submission
</p>
<p>from ignorance, that silence from despair. Who dares discuss, when
</p>
<p>with discussion and by discussion tyranny must perish ? Compare
</p>
<p>the stillness of despotism with the healthful animation, the natural
</p>
<p>warmth, the bold language, the proud bearing, which spring from
</p>
<p>freedom and the consciousness of its possession. Which will you
</p>
<p>prefer? Insult not the dignity of manhood by supposing that con-
</p>
<p>tentment of the heart can exist under despotism. There may be de-
</p>
<p>grees in its severity, and so degrees in the sufferings of its victims.
</p>
<p>Terrible the dangers which lurk under the calm surface of despotic
</p>
<p>power. The movements of the oppressed will, at times, disturb their
</p>
<p>tyrant's tranquillity, and warn him their day of vengeance or of tri-
</p>
<p>umph may be nigh. But in these happy countries the very safety
</p>
<p>of the state consists in freedom of discussion. Partial evils in all
</p>
<p>systems of political governments there must be ; but their worst
</p>
<p>effects are obviated when their cause is sought for, discovered, consi-
</p>
<p>dered, discussed. Milton has taught a great political truth, in lan-
</p>
<p>guage as instructive as his sublimest verse : " For this is not the li-
</p>
<p>" berty which we can hope, that no grievances ever should arise in
</p>
<p>" the commonwealth ; that let no man in this world expect; but
</p>
<p>" when complaints are freely heard, deeply considered, and speedily re-
</p>
<p>", formed, then is the utmost bound of civil liberty obtained that wise
</p>
<p>" men look for." Suffer the complaints of the Irish people to be
</p>
<p>freely heard. You want the power to have them speedily reformed.
</p>
<p>Their case to-day may be yours to-morrow. Preserve the right of

<p>free discussion as you would cling to life. Combat error with argu-
</p>
<p>ment  misrepresentation by fact  falsehood with truth. " For who
</p>
<p>" knows not," saith the same great writer, " that truth is strono-
</p>
<p>" next to the Almighty. One needs no policies nor stratagems to
</p>
<p>" make her victorious ; these are the shifts error uses against her
</p>
<p>" power." If this demand for a native Parliament rest on a delusion
</p>
<p>dispel that delusion by the omnipotence of truth. Why do you love,
</p>
<p>why do other nations honour England ? Are you  are they dazzled by
</p>
<p>her naval or military glories, the splendour of her literature, her sub-
</p>
<p>lime discoveries in science, her boundless wealth, her almost incredi-
</p>
<p>ble labours in every work of art and skill ? No ; you love her you
</p>
<p>cling to England because she has been for ages past the seat of free
</p>
<p>discussion, and, therefore, the home of rational freedom, and the hope
</p>
<p>of oppressed men throughout the world. Under the laws of England
</p>
<p>it is our happiness to live. They breathe the spirit of liberty and rea-

<p>552
</p>
<p>son. Emulate this day the great virtues of Englishmen, their love of
</p>
<p>fairness, their immoveable independence, and the sense of justice
</p>
<p>rooted in their nature; these are the virtues which qualify jurors to
</p>
<p>decide the rights of their fellow-men. Deserted by these, of what
</p>
<p>avail is the tribunal of a jury? It is worthless as the human body
</p>
<p>when the living soul has fled. Prove to the accused, from whom,
</p>
<p>perchance, you widely differ in opinion, whose liberties and fortunes
</p>
<p>are in your hands, that you are there, not to persecute, but to save.
</p>
<p>Believe you will not secure the true interests of England by leaning
</p>
<p>too severely on your countrymen. They say to their English brethren,
</p>
<p>and with truth : We have been at your side whenever danger was
</p>
<p>to be faced or honour won. The scorching sun of the East and the
</p>
<p>pestilence of the West we have endured to spread your commerce,
</p>
<p>to extend your empire, to uphold your glory. The bones of our
</p>

<p>Fighting your battles they fell ; in a nobler cause they could not.

<p>We have helped to gather your imperishable laurels. We have

<p>helped to win your immortal triumphs. Now, in time of peace, we

<p>ask you to restore that Parliament you planted here with your laws

<p>and language, uprooted in a dismal period of our history, in the mo-
</p>
<p>ment of our terror, our divisions, our weakness  it may be  our

<p>people's choice ; replace the peerage, the Corinthian pillars of the
</p>
<p>Capitol, secured and adorned with the strength and splendour of the
</p>
<p>crown ; and let the Monarch of England, as in ages past, rule a
</p>
<p>brilliant and united empire in solidity, magnificence, and power.
</p>
<p>When the privileges of the English Parliament were invaded, that
</p>
<p>people took the field, struck down the Ministry, and dragged their

<p>Sovereign to the block. We shall not be ready to imitate the Eng-

<p>lish precedent ; we struggle for a Parliament, its surest bulwark.
</p>
<p>That institution you prize so highly, which fosters your wealth,

<p>adds to your prosperity, and guards your freedom, was ours for 600

<p>rogative of the Crown. Our gracious Sovereign needs not State pro-
</p>
<p>secutions to secure her prerogatives, or preserve her power. She
</p>
<p>has the unbought loyalty of a chivalrous and gallant people. The
</p>
<p>arm of authority she requires not to raise. The glory of her gentle

<p>rein will be  >she will have ruled, not by the sword, but by the affec-

<p>Do you, from what has been said, and from the better arguments

<p>omitted, which may be well suggested by your manly understandings
</p>
<p>and your honest hearts, give a verdict consistent with justice, yet
</p>
<p>leaning to liberty; dictated by truth, yet inclining to the side of ac-
</p>
<p>cused men, struggling against the weight, and power, and influence
</p>
<p>of the Crown, and prejudice more overwhelming still ; a verdict to be
</p>
<p>553
</p>
<p>applauded, not by a party, but by the impartial monitor within you
</p>
<p>breasts, becoming- the high spirit of Irish gentlemen, and the intrepid
</p>
<p>guardians of the rights and liberties of a free people.
</p>
<p>Mr. Macdonogh.
</p>
<p>May it please your Lordships, Gentlemen of the Jury,
</p>
<p>In this case I am counsel for Mr. Richard Barrett, the proprietor
</p>
<p>of the Pilot newspaper. He stands indicted for an unlawful, mali-
</p>
<p>cious, and seditious conspiracy against the laws and Constitution of
</p>
<p>the realm. Associated with him in that indictment are two Mem-
</p>
<p>bers of Parliament, one of them a gentleman of high rank in the Pro-
</p>
<p>fession of the law, holding a patent of precedence under the Crown,
</p>
<p>and entitled to precedence next after Her Majesty's Sergeants. But
</p>
<p>this prosecution takes a wider range, and aspires to a loftier flight, for
</p>
<p>it involves in its moral condemnation millions of the Irish people.
</p>
<p>The counsel for the prosecution admit they have no direct or ex-
</p>
<p>press evidence to establish this conspiracy, but they represent their
</p>
<p>case as one of presumptive proof  of circumstantial evidence ; it be-
</p>
<p>comes, therefore, of importance, that you should reflect upon the
</p>
<p>true principles of judgment in such a case, for to you is confided the
</p>
<p>duty of hearing and determining (guided by the wisdom of the Court)
</p>
<p>upon facts and probabilities, and those presumptions which the law
</p>
<p>entitles you to make.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I presume that you are familiar with the principle,
</p>
<p>that every man enters a court of justice with the presumption of in-
</p>
<p>nocence in his favour. It requires in the prisoner no station or place
</p>
<p>in society to raise such a presumption. The law of England is a law
</p>
<p>of justice, and it does not narrow or restrict its presumptions of inno-
</p>
<p>cence to any particular class of the Queen's subjects. I have the
</p>
<p>assurance and authority of the law for telling you, that the law of the
</p>
<p>land presumes every man to be innocent till the contrary is proved.
</p>
<p>It is so laid down in Roscoe, Crim. Law, 16. And how is this proof
</p>
<p>to be made ? not by exciting suspicion, not by creating doubts or
</p>
<p>difficulties, or placing the prisoner in an equivocal position ; no, to
</p>
<p>justify a verdict of guilty, it is not enough to collect from the evi-

</p>
<p>dence, that the defendant, in any particular case, may be guilty, or
</p>
<p>probably is guilty, but his innocence must be quite incompatible with
</p>
<p>the fair result of the whole proof. It was the emphatic declaration
</p>
<p>of Lord Kenyon, that "no man ought, or can be convicted in Eng-
</p>
<p>" land, unless the Judge and the jury have a firm assurance that
</p>
<p>" innocence cannot, by any possibility, be the victim of conviction and
</p>
<p>" sentence." You may have heard it said, that circumstantial evidence
</p>
<p>is, sometimes, safer than direct testimony. That is so in one case
</p>
<p>only, namely, where the circumstances are utterly incompatible with
</p>
<p>the innocence of the party. But, Gentlemen, the utmost caution is
</p>
<p>necessary in giving weight and effect to evidence of a circumstantial
</p>
<p>character; Roscoe, Crim. Law, 17-20. Now, if the most guarded
</p>
<p>4B
</p>
<p>554
</p>
<p>caution be necessary, even in cases where the evidence of circum-
</p>
<p>stances is all one icay, with how much greater force does this obser-
</p>
<p>vation apply when you are considering a case in which the circum-
</p>
<p>stances are conflicting, where many of them have great strength in
</p>
<p>favour of the defendants, and lead to the conclusion of innocence ?
</p>
<p>It is my duty to endeavour to convince you of that innocence, and to
</p>
<p>submit, for your better consideration, such arguments as may tend to
</p>
<p>show that the evidence does not satisfy the allegations upon this re-
</p>
<p>cord. The indictment charges the traversers with conspiring to raise
</p>
<p>and create discontent and disaffection among the liege subjects of the
</p>
<p>Queen, and to excite them to hatred and contempt of the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment and the Constitution of the realm, and to excite hatred and
</p>
<p>jealousies and ill-will amongst different classes of said subjects, and to
</p>
<p>create discontent and disaffection among divers of the said subjects,
</p>
<p>and amongst others Her Majesty's subjects serving in the army,
</p>
<p>and to bring into disrepute and diminish the confidence of Her Ma-
</p>
<p>jesty's subjects in the tribunals duly constituted for the administration
</p>
<p>of justice, and by means of intimidation and the demonstration of great
</p>
<p>physical force, to procure changes to be made in the Constitution of
</p>
<p>the realm. In these terms, the intent and the conspiracy to carry it
</p>
<p>out are stated, and the indictment then proceeds to enumerate several
</p>
<p>overt acts, such as that the parties assembled in a variety of places,
</p>
<p>with thousands of other persons, that they made certain seditious
</p>
<p>speeches ; and the first count of the indictment concludes with
</p>
<p>charging three newspapers, the Pilot, the Nation, and the Free-
</p>
<p>man, with publishing the speeches so delivered. Now, Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, divest that indictment of its jargon. Ponder the weight and
</p>
<p>scrutinize the severity of its charges. Reflect upon the number
</p>
<p>of persons it shadows, if it does not include, and I think you will
</p>
<p>concur with me, that so awful an accusation ought not to be lightly
</p>
<p>hazarded, and that the clearness, the simplicity, and the cogency of
</p>
<p>the evidence ought to be proportioned to the magnitude of the
</p>
<p>cause. Is the evidence clear, simple, or cogent? Is it not obscure,
</p>
<p>involved, and inconclusive? What masses of documents  what a mul-

</p>
<p>titude of speeches  what a vast variety of petty and isolated things
</p>
<p>have been heaped, not even grouped, together to make out this
</p>
<p>charge  " this baseless fabric of a vision !" As if to render confusion
</p>
<p>worse confounded, the Crown inverted all order, and began at the
</p>
<p>last monster meeting at Mullaghmast. This was, I suppose, to throw
</p>
<p>light on the case; but, Gentlemen, I shall attempt to throw light
</p>
<p>upon the case, by commencing at the commencement, and by presenting
</p>
<p>to your minds the proofs applicable to each meeting, without regard
</p>
<p>to the stage of the proceedings at which the Crown thought fit to in-
</p>
<p>troduce the evidence. It is the more imperatively necessary to take
</p>
<p>this course, and to read, and to insist upon those portions of the
</p>
<p>speeches which are favourable to the traversers, inasmuch as those
</p>
<p>which were calculated to prove injurious, were read and most elabo-
</p>
<p>rately collated, and commented upon in the opening speech for the
</p>
<p>Crown ; and allow me to express my persuasion, that you will take
</p>
<p>notes of the context of those speeches, wTlh the same honest perse-
</p>
<p>verance which you have exhibited during the whole progress of this
</p>
<p>investigation.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the first meeting  in order of time, though not in
</p>
<p>order of proof  of which evidence has been given by the Crown, was
</p>
<p>that which took place at Mullingar. I pray of you to refer to your
</p>
<p>notes, and find there, if you can, anything deserving the name of evi~
</p>
<p>deuce upon this branch of the case? Has any sworn witness told
</p>
<p>you that there was a meeting at Mullingar? Have its numbers been
</p>
<p>stated with certainty, lessened by design, or exaggerated by fancy ?
</p>
<p>No, Gentlemen, there is no witness. No human being who was at
</p>
<p>that meeting is produced. To no one can the test of cross-examina-
</p>
<p>tion be applied. The meeting took place in a county not very re-
</p>
<p>mote from this metropolis, a county studded with police stations,
</p>
<p>abounding in magistrates, and its beautiful vales and bills inhabited by
</p>
<p>a peaceful, and, I hope, a loyal population. Yet such was the cha-
</p>
<p>racter of this meeting, so mild, so peaceful, so unexceptionable, that
</p>
<p>the gentlemen who conduct this case on the part of the prosecution,
</p>
<p>who must have received the most ample information on the subject,
</p>
<p>have made their election to turn aside from the inquiry and to call no
</p>
<p>witness, either policeman, inhabitant, or magistrate. Oh ! but they
</p>
<p>have one of the public newspapers of the day, and they have resorted for
</p>
<p>evidence to the Pilot of the 15th of May, 1843. The portion which
</p>
<p>they read purports to be a report of a public meeting held at Mul-
</p>
<p>lingar, on the 14th of May. At that time Mr. Barrett was the regis-
</p>
<p>tered proprietor and printer of that paper. He was responsible for
</p>
<p>what appeared in it. No other person, none of the other traversers, had
</p>
<p>control over this publication. If the report of the speeches said to
</p>
<p>have been made at that meeting were a libel upon the Government, or
</p>
<p>contained in it aught that could be considered seditious, the Crown
</p>
<p>had the utmost facility for prosecuting Mr. Barrett. They might
</p>
<p>have indicted him for that publication, they might have indicted him
</p>
<p>in May, 1843, and your attention would have been confined to a sin-
</p>
<p>gle act, and not distracted, as it has been, by a variety of topics. The
</p>
<p>construction of that alleged libel, and the ascertaining the motives
</p>
<p>with which it was published, would have been a compound question

</p>
<p>of law and fact, exclusively within the province of a jury. However,
</p>
<p>that course was not pursued by the Crown. That report was not ar-
</p>
<p>raigned as, per se, a seditious libel ; neither was any merely personal
</p>
<p>or individual guilt ever attributed to Mr. Barrett, upon the ground
</p>
<p>that his newspaper was made the medium of communicating to the
</p>
<p>world the speeches delivered at that meeting. The plain and pal-
</p>
<p>pable allegation of crime was avoided, and in its stead you are
</p>
<p>trying a charge of that species of crime which Sir William Rus-
</p>
<p>sell, and other respectable writers on criminal law have thus charac-
</p>
<p>terized. In 2 Russ., 675, it is thus laid down : " Perhaps few things
</p>
<p>" are left so doubtful in the criminal law, as the point at which
</p>
<p>" a combination of several persons in a common object be-
</p>
<p>" comes illegal." Instead of trying a plain offence in 1843
</p>
<p>they chose to follow this doubtful and uncertain course. The
</p>
<p>incertitude of this offence was not its only charm. It affords a
</p>
<p>556
</p>
<p>species of constructive machinery, whereby individuals may be linked
</p>
<p>together, and the acts of one man may be tortured into the guilt of
</p>
<p>another. Accordingly, the old newspaper of May, 1843, which was
</p>
<p>just hastening to oblivion, is reproduced in January, 1844. It is
</p>
<p>offered in evidence, not only as against Mr. Barrett, but against each
</p>
<p>and every one of these traversers, not only as showing that he pub-
</p>
<p>lished it, but as showing a criminality of mind and a guilty combina-
</p>
<p>tion amongst them, to carry out their object as conspirators. As to
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett himself, if this were an indictment for libel, there would
</p>
<p>be abundant evidence of publication. In Boscoe's Law of Evidence,
</p>
<p>pp. 603-4, it is said : " That it is now well established, that in order
</p>
<p>" to render a party guilty of publishing a libel, it is not necessary
</p>
<p>" that he should be the actual publisher of it, or that he should even
</p>
<p>" have a knowledge of the publication ; not only is a person who
</p>
<p>" procures another to publish a libel, himself guilty of the offence
</p>
<p>" (Hawk. P. C, B. 1, c. 73, s. 10), but a bookseller or publisher whose
</p>
<p>" servant publishes a libel, is criminally answerable for that act,
</p>
<p>" though it was done without his knowledge. This rule, which is an
</p>
<p>" exception to those which govern the other branches of criminal
</p>
<p>" law, appears to be founded upon a principle of policy, and to have
</p>
<p>" been arbitrarily adopted, with a view of rendering publishers cau-
</p>
<p>" tious with regard to the matters to which they give general circu-
</p>
<p>" Iation." For, although the printer and publisher of this paper, he
</p>
<p>may not have actually known the contents of it, yet by an arbitrary
</p>
<p>rule of law, he is supposed to have adopted it, thus violating that
</p>
<p>principle of the common law, that to constitute crime, the mind and
</p>
<p>act of the party must concur. This arbitrary rule could be readily
</p>
<p>applied to Mr. Barrett. Even to that rule there are exceptions, in
</p>
<p>page G05, where it is said : " So it is said by Mr. Starkie, that the
</p>
<p>" defendant may rebut the presumption by evidence that the libel
</p>
<p>" was sold contrary to his orders, or clandestinely, or that some
</p>
<p>" deceit or surprise was practised on him, or that he was absent
</p>
<p>" under circumstances which entirely negative any presumption of
</p>
<p>" privity or connivance." 2 Starkie on Slander, 34, 2nd Ed. How-

</p>
<p>ever this may be in libel, I assert that on this indictment he can-
</p>
<p>not be rendered liable by reason of any constructive publica-
</p>
<p>tion. A conspiracy is the charge. To convict him you must be
</p>
<p>satisfied that he was a personal conspirator. But with what show of
</p>
<p>justice, can this report in a public newspaper be pressed as being en-
</p>
<p>titled to any the least importance as against the other traversers?
</p>
<p>What is this report? A mere narrative of past facts  a recital of
</p>
<p>antecedent things. My Lords, in 1 Phillips on Evidence, page 202,
</p>
<p>you will find this passage : "In Hardy's case a question arose, as to
</p>
<p>" the admissibility of a letter written by Thelwal, and sent to a third
</p>
<p>" person not connected with the conspiracy, containing seditious
</p>
<p>" songs, which the letter stated to have been composed and sung at
</p>
<p>" the anniversary meeting of the Corresponding Society, of which
</p>
<p>" Society the prisoner and the writer of the letter were proved to be
</p>
<p>" members. The argument in favour of the evidence was, that the
</p>
<p>" letter was an act done in furtherance of the conspiracy ; that the
</p>
<p>557
</p>
<p>" letter contained language of incitement, not merely a narrative or
</p>
<p>" confession by a stranger, and that in such case, scvibere est agere.
</p>
<p>" The objection was, that the letter contained merely a relation by the
</p>
<p>" writer that certain songs had been sung, which could not be evidence
</p>
<p>" against the prisoner. The majority of the Court decided against
</p>
<p>" the admissibility of the letter." It may be said, this was circulated
</p>
<p>amongst the public, and therefore that it differs from a letter written
</p>
<p>by a conspirator, giving an account of the transactions of the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. There is a difference, but it is in my favour, and against
</p>
<p>the effect of this evidence as proof of a conspiracy. In 2 Starkie on
</p>
<p>Evidence, p. 324, it is said: " Such evidence is more or less strong,
</p>
<p>" according to the danger ox publicity of the object of concurrence. . . .
</p>
<p>" The more secret the one and the greater the coincidence in the
</p>
<p>" other, the stronger is the evidence of the conspiracy."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, it may excite some surprise, and it is not for me to
</p>
<p>foresee whether posterity will condemn a prosecution, in which, when
</p>
<p>it is proposed to strike down a political adversary, the first piece of evi-
</p>
<p>dence against him was one of the public newspapers of the party that
</p>
<p>he espoused, published ten months before the charge was preferred.
</p>
<p>These meetings are alleged as overt acts to convince you that there
</p>
<p>was a concert and previous conspiracy between those parties. These
</p>
<p>overt acts do not constitute a crime, but they are offered in evidence
</p>
<p>to induce you to come to the conclusion that these parties have met,
</p>
<p>combined, and consulted for the wicked purpose charged in the in-
</p>
<p>dictment. Now, Gentlemen, I will call your attention to this piece
</p>
<p>of evidence, if it deserves to be called so. If you or I subscribe to a
</p>
<p>particular society, is it fair that we should be liable for a publication
</p>
<p>in a newspaper, stating the views of that society? The newspaper
</p>
<p>which was given in evidence of the overt acts at that meeting was the
</p>
<p>Pilot of the 15th of May. On that occasion, the chairman said:
</p>
<p>' They had assembled for the purpose of petitioning for a Repeal of
</p>
<p>' the Act of Union, having found, by bitter experience, that the Im-
</p>
<p>' perial Parliament was not able, or, at least, willing to do any good
</p>
<p>' for Ireland. If they had back their own Parliament, Irish interests

</p>
<p>' would be attended to ; and he need hardly tell them, that if they
</p>
<p>' had it, the Irish agricultural interest would not have been so com-
</p>
<p>' pletely ruined as it was. It was a shame for the landed interest and
</p>
<p>' the aristocracy, who were instrumental in putting the present Go-
</p>
<p>' vernment into power, and who were almost ruined, without any
</p>
<p>' good being done to any other class, that they did not come forward
</p>
<p>' and declare that they should legislate for themselves and manage
</p>
<p>' their own affairs. If they had their Parliament, native industry and
</p>
<p>< manufactures would be encouraged, taxation would be reduced to
</p>
<p>' less than half what it was at the present time, the people would be
</p>
<p>' able to purchase a large quantity of the beef and mutton produced
</p>
<p>' in the country ; the labourer and the artizan would have constant
</p>
<p>' employment aud good wages; sectarian prejudices and animosities
</p>
<p>' would be totally forgotten in the universal prosperity and happi-
</p>
<p>' ness that would exist throughout the country, and Ireland would
</p>
<p>'then constitute the real strength of England, instead of being, as
</p>
<p>she was at present, a source of weakness and embarrassment to her.
</p>
<p>558
</p>
<p>" These were blessings worth struggling for, and they had come there
</p>
<p>" that day to assist the Li'uerator of their country in obtaining them."
</p>
<p>That was the speech of the chairman, indicating the objects of the
</p>
<p>meeting, and now you will observe the only speech referred to as an
</p>
<p>overt act at that meeting was the speech of Mr. Barrett. The Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General read a passage of that speech, which he said was sedi-
</p>
<p>tious ; but it will be my duty to read to you, not only the entire
</p>
<p>of that speech, as one portion of it explains the other portion, but
</p>
<p>also the speech of Mr. O'Connell on that occasion. The Crown
</p>
<p>have proved, if the newspaper be of any value, and they have no
</p>
<p>other evidence, that this was a meeting for lawful purposes, and that
</p>
<p>it was not in its inception, nor in its progress did it become an un-
</p>
<p>lawful assembly. The object of the meeting was to petition Par-
</p>
<p>liament, for the Repeal of an Act of Parliament, and that is a right
</p>
<p>which every British subject may freely and fully exercise. The Bill
</p>
<p>of Rights, independent of former Statutes, had asserted and defined
</p>
<p>the subject's right to petition Parliament. Power had, indeed, sanc-
</p>
<p>tioned certain glosses and restrictions upon this right ; and the exer-
</p>
<p>cise of this common right was, at certain periods of our history, at-
</p>
<p>tempted to be curtailed ; but the free spirit of Englishmen cannot
</p>
<p>be extinguished ; once more was this privilege asserted ; once again
</p>
<p>was its exercise enlarged, and by the 1 W. & M. St. 2, c. 2, the
</p>
<p>Legislature of England again declared, " that the subject hath a right
</p>
<p>" to petition, and that all commitments and prosecutions for such
</p>
<p>" petitioning are illegal." I will prove that from a book which has
</p>
<p>frequently been adverted to in the progreess of this trial. In the
</p>
<p>case ofRegina v. Vincent, 9 Car. & P. 109, Baron Alderson says, in
</p>
<p>giving judgment: " The purpose which the defendants had in view,

<p>" as stated by the prosecutors, was to excite disaifection and discon-

</p>
<p>" argument and proper petitions to obtain the five points mentioned
</p>
<p>" by their counsel." If that were so, I think.it is by no means
</p>
<p>" illegal to petition on those points." And in Kemp v. Gee, 2

<p>" mons, 9th February, 8 Will. III., in which it was declared that
</p>
<p>" all petitions to the House of Commons were lawful or at least
</p>
<p>u punishable by themselves only." Now, Gentlemen, it was lawful for
</p>
<p>the people to meet to petition Parliament, and it was proved that they
</p>
<p>did meet for that purpose, and as soon as the universal feeling was de-
</p>
<p>monstrated, then was the time to present their petitions to the House
</p>
<p>of Commons. It is equally clear, and indeed it is a corollary to and
</p>
<p>from that right, that the people of this country have a perfect right to
</p>
<p>meet for the purpose of stating what are, or even what they consider to
</p>
<p>be their grievances. Such is the language of Bn.ron /-Uderson in a care-
</p>
<p>fully prepared charge delivered to the Grand Jury of Monmouth,
</p>
<p>in 1839, and to be found in the note to the Queen v. Vincent, 9 C. &
</p>
<p>P., 95. In De Lolme, Com. B. 2, c. 12, pp. 438-9: " Nor has the
</p>
<p>" great freedom of canvassing political subjects we have described,
</p>
<p>" been limited or confined to the walls of Westminster, that is to the
</p>
<p>" exclusive spot on which the two Houses meet : the like privilege
</p>
<p>559
</p>
<p>" is allowed to the other orders of the people ; and a full scope is
</p>
<p>" given to that spirit of party, and a complete security extended to
</p>
<p>" those numerous and irregular meetings, which, especially when di-
</p>
<p>U rected to matters of government, create so much uneasiness in the
</p>
<p>" sovereigns of other countries. Individuals even may, in such
</p>
<p>" meetings, take an active part for procuring the success of those
</p>
<p>" public steps which they wish to see pursued ; they may frame peti-
</p>
<p>" tions to be delivered to the Crown, or to both Houses, either to
</p>
<p>" procure the repeal of measures already entered upon by Govern-
</p>
<p>" ment, or to prevent the passing of such as are under consideration,
</p>
<p>"or to obtain the enacting of new regulations of any kind: they
</p>
<p>" may severally subscribe their names to such petition Such
</p>
<p>" meetings may be repeated, and every individual may deliver what
</p>
<p>" opinion he pleases on the proposed subjects, though ever so di-
</p>
<p>" rectly opposite to the views and avowed designs of the Govern-
</p>
<p>" ment." I said, Gentlemen, that the Crown have proved that this
</p>
<p>meeting never became an illegal assembly. They have attempted
</p>
<p>to show nothing to the contrary, and it is a rule of law, as well as
</p>
<p>of good sense, that of things not appearing upon a criminal trial,
</p>
<p>and not existing, the same estimation is to be held. But affirma-
</p>
<p>tively it is in proof, that this assemblage having unanimously passed
</p>
<p>a resolution declaratory of loyalty and devotion to the Queen, gave
</p>
<p>three cheers for Her Majesty, and quietly dispersed. Have I not
</p>
<p>therefore, established, that the Crown have not only not proved, but
</p>
<p>they have not attempted to prove that this was an illegal assembly.
</p>
<p>No speech at that meeting is charged as an act of conspiracy, but a
</p>
<p>passage in an after-dinner speech of Mr. Barrett is selected as an
</p>
<p>overt act of conspiracy. Let us assume that this sentence of the
</p>
<p>speech, if spoken before dinner, might have been open to the charge
</p>
<p>of indiscretion, as being liable to misconstruction. Spoken, as it was,
</p>
<p>after dinner, it betrays a very great confusion of metaphorical lan-
</p>
<p>guage. The old woman and the cow I confess I do not understand.
</p>
<p>But to argue gravely, that this was an overt act of conspiracy, sur-
</p>
<p>passes anything which I have ever seen resorted to, in the despe-

<p>ration of a falling cause. He did not say, " we will stand up and
</p>
<p>fight," but he said, " they may silence us if they please, but
</p>
<p>" we will clutch our independence ; not a separation of the two
</p>
<p>" countries, but a Repeal of the Union."
</p>
<p>The next meeting in order of time, is the Longford meeting, which
</p>
<p>took place on the 29th of May. Although these meetings were not pre-
</p>
<p>sented to you in their order, I shall take them as they in fact occurred.
</p>
<p>In reference to this meeting, two policemen were examined as witnesses,
</p>
<p>James Johnston and John Maguire. I regret the manner in which
</p>
<p>Johnston gave his evidence. I was sorry to hear him speak, almost
</p>
<p>contemptuously, of persons whom he called priests ; and I am sure I
</p>
<p>shall have your approbation, when I express a wish that temperate and
</p>
<p>chastened language should become the standard style when we speak
</p>
<p>of the ministers of any creed. One of those gentlemen of whom he
</p>
<p>spoke in so depreciating a style, Mr. O'Brien, stated, " that the loy-
</p>
<p>alty of Ireland was not the loyalty of expediency," and added, " that
</p>
<p>560
</p>
<p>" Ireland should cease to be legislated for by persons ignorant of her
</p>
<p>" condition." This man gives a miserable outline of some few senten-
</p>
<p>ces spoken by those on the platform, and I very much apprehend that
</p>
<p>Mr. Johnston was labouring under some excitement himself, when he
</p>
<p>told Mr.Fitzgibbon, on his cross-examination, that " the people came in
</p>
<p>in a sweating rage of excitement." Yet there was no anger or breach of
</p>
<p>the peace; and his comrade, Maguire, adds to this, by saying, "that
</p>
<p>" there was not even a tendency to a breach of the peace; that the peo-
</p>
<p>" pie came into town merrily ; and that when the speeches were over,
</p>
<p>" the people retired quietly, and their wives and children with them."
</p>
<p>The chief mottoes which welcomed Mr. O'Connell's entrance into
</p>
<p>Longford were, Cead mille Faltaigh, and Repeal and no Separation.
</p>
<p>In addition to this, the Crown have read in evidence against Dr.
</p>
<p>Gray, and, as they contend, against all the traversers, the Freeman's
</p>
<p>Journal of the 30th May. That paper contains a retaliation on Lord
</p>
<p>Beaumont, who had thought proper to make a very severe onslaught
</p>
<p>on Mr. O'Connell, and he uses terms of a very severe character, for
</p>
<p>which Lord Beaumont might have instituted a prosecution if he
</p>
<p>pleased; but with the conduct of Lord Beaumont, you, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>have nothing to do ; that is not to be the foundation of your verdict.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the counsel for the Crown next read in evidence the
</p>
<p>Freeman s Journal of the 31st of May. Several passages of Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell's speech were read from that paper, which it was thought
</p>
<p>might be injurious to him; but I shall now read for you some pas-
</p>
<p>sages that were not read by the Attorney-General; he says :  [Mr.
</p>
<p>Macdonogh here read and commented on a number of extracts from
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell's speech at the Association, on the 31st of May, to
</p>
<p>prove that his intention was to promote good will and union among all
</p>
<p>classes of Her Majesty's subjects.] Gentlemen, there were some
</p>
<p>passages which were not read by the Attorney- General, in which
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell says, the only efficacious mode of obtaining their
</p>
<p>freedom was the exclusion of physical force. [Mr. Macdonogh
</p>
<p>read the passages].

<p>the Drogheda meeting. Not a single witness had been brought upon
</p>
<p>the table to prove that meeting, or to prove Mr. Barrett's connexion
</p>
<p>with it. All the testimony with which we have been favoured on this
</p>
<p>point is, a copy of the Pilot newspaper of the 7th of June, which
</p>
<p>contains a report of the Drogheda Repeal demonstration. Now,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, this newspaper is not evidence of the truth of the facts
</p>
<p>stated therein. This is not an original report, it is copied from the
</p>
<p>Drogheda Argus into the Pilot, and yet the proprietor is sought to
</p>
<p>ba made answerable for this second-hand report. In an indictment for
</p>
<p>libel, he could only be made answerable for the report, as acknowledg-
</p>
<p>ed in the paper, from the Drogheda Argus, and yet this second-
</p>
<p>hand copy is put forward as evidence of this conspiracy. [Mr. Mac-
</p>
<p>donogh then read the address to Mr. O'Connell at Drogheda, and
</p>
<p>a number of passages from the Pilot of the 7th of June.] These
</p>
<p>are the sentiments of the minds of the people who were assem-
</p>
<p>561
</p>
<p>bled on that day. They have put them on record, and the Crown
</p>
<p>has proved them. Well, now hear the sentiments of the man to
</p>
<p>whom that address was presented ; and, Gentlemen, I pray your most
</p>
<p>particular attention to it. [Mr. Macdonogh proceeded to read the ob-
</p>
<p>servations made by Mr. O'Connell, in which he stated that he was
</p>
<p>ashamed of some people who had groaned at a certain house.] He
</p>
<p>made the people promise they would not groan any more. He said the
</p>
<p>law knew no distinction of parties, and that he was not working for
</p>
<p>any creed, sect, or party, but for Irishmen of all classes, creeds, and
</p>
<p>parties; he was struggling for all classes of Irishmen. He related
</p>
<p>a story of an Orangeman who sent him a pair of silk stockings, and
</p>
<p>stated that if the Union was repealed they would have more stock-
</p>
<p>ings, and two pair of feet for every one pair of stockings they had.
</p>
<p>He warned the people against joining any illegal or secret society, or
</p>
<p>taking of illegal or secret oaths, as that would be more ruinous than
</p>
<p>anything that could possibly befal them. He would shelter them un-
</p>
<p>der the privileges of the Constitution, and would violate no law,
</p>
<p>either of God or man. But here, Gentlemen, when he spoke
</p>
<p>hypothetically of a gross infraction of the Constitution with which
</p>
<p>the people were threatened, he said, " woe to the aggressors,
</p>
<p>u and woe to the people if they violate the law and get themselves into
</p>
<p>" a predicament." These were the expressions taken up by the
</p>
<p>Crown, and on which sentences the prosecution was founded. He
</p>
<p>said that notwithstanding Peel's threat, the people would not violate the
</p>
<p>law, and because he utters such sentiments as these, he is to be branded
</p>
<p>as a criminal. Monstrous doctrine ! Is he to be charged with con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, because he said he was working for the people of Ireland.
</p>
<p>You have now, Gentlemen, the vote of the assembly to that man  an
</p>
<p>assembly of most respectable and wealthy persons, who were met
</p>
<p>there for a perfectly legal and constitutional purpose. You have
</p>
<p>heard his reply to that vote, and if a sudden outbreak or burst of
</p>
<p>eloquence was used in the heat of the moment, is the man to be taken
</p>
<p>up and prosecuted as a conspirator for it? You were told about the
</p>
<p>army ; did he not tell the people he was glad they came there ? and

</p>
<p>one of the principal reasons was, that they would spend money in the
</p>
<p>country. [Mr. Macdonogh. then read the petition adopted at the meet-
</p>
<p>ing, and continued.] There is the petition adopted, and that is the
</p>
<p>result of the meeting ; and, Gentlemen, let me ask you on your so-
</p>
<p>lemn oaths was that meeting convened for criminal purposes ? The
</p>
<p>Association was in existence on the 4th of April, 1840, and up to the
</p>
<p>year 1843, when the speeches were delivered, no charge of illegality
</p>
<p>was prepared against them. The Government could not have fastened
</p>
<p>on a single violent expression made use of during that time. Nothino-
</p>
<p>was done to put down the Association, because it was perfectly tran-
</p>
<p>quil and legal, and it was only mentioned in Parliament by that very
</p>
<p>man, Lord Beaumont, who expressed his opinion that the Association
</p>
<p>ought to be put down. Then, and then only, did the Government
</p>
<p>for the first time discover a treasonable and malicious design in the
</p>
<p>4c
</p>
<p>562
</p>
<p>Association. Gentlemen, at the dinner the chairman, in proposing
</p>
<p>the Queen's health, said that the Irish people, in the midst of op-
</p>
<p>pression, had been always remarkable for their loyalty; and he was
</p>
<p>sure that it would be received as it usually had been. And how was
</p>
<p>this toast received, Gentlemen of the Jury ? Why, with loud cheers
</p>
<p>and nine times nine. And this is the proof of their disloyalty. The
</p>
<p>next toast given by the chairman was, "The health of Prince Albert,"
</p>
<p>which was received with similar plaudits. The chairman then ob-
</p>
<p>served that, whilst they paid their tribute of esteem and regard, they
</p>
<p>should not be unmindful of the mother who had educated such a daugh-
</p>
<p>ter, and he then proposed "The Duchess of Kent." The next
</p>
<p>toast, the chairman observed, was one which would be received with
</p>
<p>cordiality  it was, "The People." To this toast, Gentlemen, Mr.
</p>
<p>Barrett, it appears, responded, as appears by a report of a speech given
</p>
<p>as his in the Drogheda Argus, which was copied into the Pilot.
</p>
<p>[Mr. Macdonogh then read Mr. Barrett's speech.]
</p>
<p>The next meeting, Gentlemen, to which I shall call your attention
</p>
<p>was held at Kilkenny on the 8th June, and the proceedings at that
</p>
<p>meeting were proved by the Pilot of 12th June. No witness was
</p>
<p>produced to prove the proceedings at that meeting. Thus you find
</p>
<p>the poverty of this case ; when it comes to be analyzed, there is not an
</p>
<p>atom of evidence, except a newspaper. They might as well take the
</p>
<p>files of the Pilot or Freeman s Journal, and lay them on the table,
</p>
<p>and ask you for a conviction. They have no evidence but the Pilot.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett has copied this report from the Kilkenny Journal, and
</p>
<p>yet you are told he is a conspirator. Why has not the editor of the
</p>
<p>Kilkenny Journal been prosecuted ? why has not the editor of the
</p>
<p>Evening Mail or Saunders's been prosecuted, as those proceedings
</p>
<p>were also reported in those papers ?They are liable to be indicted if this
</p>
<p>doctrine, put forward by the Crown, be correct. Well, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>who was in the chair at that meeting ? Mr. Butler, a Member of
</p>
<p>Parliament, and he presides at that meeting, thus committing, along
</p>
<p>with several other highly respectable persons, an overt act of this con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. [Mr. Macdonogh then read the speech of Mr. Butler at

<p>the Kilkenny meeting, as reported in the Pilot of the 12th of June.]
</p>
<p>This is the evidence with which you are to convict persons. Evidence
</p>
<p>taken from the files of a newspaper. I hope it shall never be my du-
</p>
<p>ty to defend any of you, when the evidence against you will con-
</p>
<p>sist of the files of the Dublin Evening Mail. [Mr. Macdonogh
</p>
<p>here read several passages from Mr. O'Connell's speeches, both at
</p>
<p>the meeting and dinner, all breathing loyalty to the throne and at-
</p>
<p>tachment to the Sovereign, inculcating obedience to the laws and ob-
</p>
<p>servance of peace and order. He cited those passages in which the
</p>
<p>healths of the Queen, Prince Albert, and the Royal Family, weregiven
</p>
<p>as toasts.]
</p>
<p>Could such language, such sentiments, be the language and
</p>
<p>the sentiments of men conspiring against the throne and the peace of
</p>
<p>those realms ? But, Gentlemen, certain texts were selected from
</p>
<p>thosespeeches, without reference to the meaning of the entire con-
</p>
<p>563
</p>
<p>text, which has been garbled to prop up the case put forward on the
</p>
<p>part of the Crown.
</p>
<p>The next meeting I come to is that which was held at Mallow
</p>
<p>on the 11th of June. John Jolly, a Head Constable of Police, is the
</p>
<p>only witness to speak to any meeting in the south of Ireland. Cer-
</p>
<p>tain passages of speeches, said to have been made by Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell, were read by the Attorney-General in stating the case ; but
</p>
<p>he has not proved them. He read speeches made at Cork and
</p>
<p>Trim, of which he has given no evidence. John Jolly, then, and the
</p>
<p>Pilot newspaper of the 14th of June, are the only evidence of what
</p>
<p>took place at this meeting. How does Joliy describe it ? Why as a
</p>
<p>very civil procession, with the women sitting on horseback on pillions
</p>
<p>behind their husbands. Mr. Anderson, the Sub-Inspector, one better
</p>
<p>acquainted with Mallow than Jolly, was there, and is not produced.
</p>
<p>To be sure, Jolly says that Anderson was twenty or thirty yards from
</p>
<p>the speakers, and he does not think that he could have heard them.
</p>
<p>How sadly off must this prosecution be, when they resort to a little
</p>
<p>incident that occurred at this crowded meeting. A person on the
</p>
<p>platform pointed to some person in the crowd, and desired him to leave
</p>
<p>that, and he called on the crowd to cut the reins, and drive him out
</p>
<p>of that, as he was an enemy. If such a circumstance ever occurred,
</p>
<p>it is but reasonable to infer that the meaning of the speaker was, that
</p>
<p>this man created a disturbance, or interfered rudely with the persons
</p>
<p>on foot, and that his turbulence made him an enemy to the advance-
</p>
<p>ment of that cause, which they were so frequently told could be suc-
</p>
<p>cessful only by the strictest observance of the law, and the preserva-
</p>
<p>tion of quiet and good order in their assemblies. At that meeting
</p>
<p>Edmund Burke Roche, Esq., M. P., presided, and in the course of his
</p>
<p>speech he said the Irish people knew too well that the most powerful
</p>
<p>weapon they could put into the hands of the enemy was violence on
</p>
<p>their part. Mark, Gentlemen of the Jury, Mr. Roche said " enemy."
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell has been accused of using the word, but does it not
</p>
<p>clearly appear that they meant by the word those who were inimical
</p>
<p>to the cause, which they were determined by peace to advance ? Mr.

</p>
<p>Roche, in anotherpart of his speech, spoke of being superseded from
</p>
<p>the commission of the peace, and to the language used by Lord Lynd-
</p>
<p>hurst, when he called the Irish aliens in blood, religion, and language.
</p>
<p>Harsh language, Gentlemen, generally begets harsh language, and it
</p>
<p>is the excess of injustice to attribute the language arising from what
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell considered an injury or attack on his private feelings,
</p>
<p>to a foul and a formidable conspiracy to plunge this country into war.
</p>
<p>It was supposed that counsel for the Crown would have proved that
</p>
<p>the Union was a just compact ; that it was not carried by fraud, cor-
</p>
<p>ruption, and every ingenuity that it is possible to conceive. But from
</p>
<p>the beginning to the end of these proceedings no one of the counsel
</p>
<p>at the other side have started such a proposition.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the next meeting was held at Donnybrook on the 3rd
</p>
<p>of July. That meeting was held in the vicinity of our own metro-
</p>
<p>564
</p>
<p>polis, openly, in mid-day. There is a large force of police in this
</p>
<p>city and its environs, yet no one of them is produced to give you an
</p>
<p>account of that meeting ; that would not have been quite safe. Any
</p>
<p>little invention or delicate colouring with which the subject might
</p>
<p>have been tinted, could not be received or credited as to that meeting,
</p>
<p>The public voice would have exclaimed against the man who should
</p>
<p>dare to assert, that there was the least disposition (o a violation of the
</p>
<p>law in that assemblage, or that a single expression from the crowd
</p>
<p>indicated feelings of sectarianism, or hostility to the Constitution of
</p>
<p>the country. It is, indeed, a singular fact that not a single inhabitant
</p>
<p>of Ireland is brought forward, to aid this attempt at stifling free dis-
</p>
<p>cussion in this country. Ross, the disguised spy, stands forth as the
</p>
<p>solitary witness. This man was discharged as an insolvent on the
</p>
<p>25th of June: on the 2nd of July he arrives in Ireland, ostensibly as
</p>
<p>connected with the Morning Chronicle, in reality the paid agent of
</p>
<p>the Government. This distressed man receives 400. He reported
</p>
<p>after this fashion : he took verbatim notes of what he considered
</p>
<p>material., which I shall translate, " what he considered useful or
</p>
<p>agreeable to his employers." Of other passages he took topical
</p>
<p>notes. His words are : " I have taken a full short-hand note of all
</p>
<p>" matters which I considered important in this speech : and then when
</p>
<p>" I came to a passage which may be a description of the evils which
</p>
<p>" the country has suffered or may be supposed to have suffered from the
</p>
<p>" Union, of this I did not take so full a note." This man swore that
</p>
<p>not 50,000 would have induced him to come over to Ireland, if he
</p>
<p>had not come for a newspaper. Not being such Reporter, he would
</p>
<p>not come for less than 75,000. This person gives what I designate
</p>
<p>a garbled account of Mr. O'Connell's speeech at Donnybrook. Im-
</p>
<p>perfectly given though it be, it is a bold and eloquent reply to the
</p>
<p>Ministers of England. It refers to the declaration of his Grace, the
</p>
<p>Duke of Wellington, in the Lords, and the Right Honourable gen-
</p>
<p>tleman, Sir Robert Peel, in the House of Commons. His remarks
</p>
<p>are strong, derisive, severe, perhaps unjust ; but had he not a right,
</p>
<p>is it not the privilege of the free subjects of Great Britain to canvass

</p>
<p>the conduct and sentiments of the responsible Ministers of the Crown ?
</p>
<p>It is so; and to show that it is so, I shall read a passage to you from
</p>
<p>DeLolme, Book 2, chap. 12, pp. 212-213. He says: " We may,
</p>
<p>" therefore, look upon it as a further proof of the soundness of the
</p>
<p>" principles on which the English Constitution is founded, that it
</p>
<p>" has allotted to the people themselves the province of openly can-
</p>
<p>" vassing and arraigning the conduct of those who are invested with
</p>
<p>" any branch of public authority, and that it has thus delivered into
</p>
<p>" the hands of the people at large the exercise of the censorial power.
</p>
<p>" Every subject in England has not only the right to present petitions
</p>
<p>" to the King, or to the Houses of Parliament, but he has a right
</p>
<p>" also to lay his complaints and observations before the public by
</p>
<p>" means of an open Press. A formidable right this to those who rule
</p>
<p>"mankind; and which, continually dispelling the cloud of majesty
</p>
<p>565
</p>
<p>11 by which they are surrounded, brings them to a level with the rest
</p>
<p>" of the people, and strikes at the very being of their authority. And
</p>
<p>" indeed this privilege is that which has been obtained by the Eng-
</p>
<p>" lish nation with the greatest difficulty, and latest in point of time,
</p>
<p>" at the expense of the executive power." Ross has not entirely
</p>
<p>destroyed the effects of the speech, in his efforts at setting down what
</p>
<p>he conceived material. I find, even in his report, the following
</p>
<p>passsages : " Old Ireland and Liberty. Yes, there never was such
</p>
<p>" a national uprising ; such a simultaneous declaration of opi-
</p>
<p>" nion ; such a manifestation of popular determination ; such a na-
</p>
<p>" tional resolve, recorded in the presence of high heaven, announcing
</p>
<p>" to the nationsof the earth, that Ireland shall be free, and the Union
</p>
<p>" repealed." Again, " Let there be no riot, no violence, no tumult,
</p>
<p>" no breach of the peace. Let us exhibit sobriety, order, tranquil-
</p>
<p>" li ty  all crowned by immortal and imperishable determination."
</p>
<p>In allusion to the declaration before-mentioned, he says : " We de-
</p>
<p>" clared that we would not go to war; that we would observe the
</p>
<p>" law; that we would be peaceable; that we would attack nobody :
</p>
<p>" but we hurled defiance against those who would attempt to attack
</p>
<p>" us, and accordingly we have gained one victory." Again, he says :
</p>
<p>" Nothing so irritates our enemies, as our dogged perseverance in
</p>
<p>" keeping the peace." Gentlemen, I have read those passages to
</p>
<p>show what was the whole tenor of Mr. O'Connell's speeches.
</p>
<p>The next meeting was held at Tu'lamore, on the 16th of July,
</p>
<p>of which M'Namara, note-taker, John Sampson Stewart, and Mr.
</p>
<p>Neal Brown, resident magistrate, are witnesses. At that meeting,
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, whilst he shows the people how he met the declara-
</p>
<p>tion in reference to Repeal and civil war, most carefully and elabo-
</p>
<p>rately cautions the people against what might lead them into crime.
</p>
<p>He speaks first to the educated portion of the assemblage, in these
</p>
<p>terms : " The Packet came in in the morning, and announced that
</p>
<p>" determination, and next day I had the Association assembled. I
</p>
<p>" stated that we broke no law ; that we stood upon the constitution,
</p>
<p>" and hurled back a high and haughty defiance." To the lower

</p>
<p>class, who might not so well understand this language, he says :
</p>
<p>" Spies and informers have invented the Ribbon Society ; but if
</p>
<p>" any man in your county becomes a Ribbonman, catch hold of the
</p>
<p>" man who made him so, and bring him to justice. Let every man
</p>
<p>" who promises me that he will catch a Ribbonman, hold up his
</p>
<p>" hand." And the witness remembered that the crowd did hold up
</p>
<p>their hands. Several other gentlemen delivered speeches at that
</p>
<p>meeting. They explained fully to the people the meaning of the
</p>
<p>word " Repeal ; " what its object was ; and why it was to be struggled
</p>
<p>for. The Chairman, a very much respected person in that part of
</p>
<p>the country, stated Mr. O'Connell's object, " to bring back our na-
</p>
<p>" tive Parliament; to establish a legislature in this country that will
</p>
<p>" make the laws for the benefit of the people." The adoption of a
</p>
<p>petition to Parliament for a Repeal of the Union was moved, se-
</p>
<p>566
</p>
<p>conded, and carried. Mr. Robinson, a gentleman of the Society of
</p>
<p>Friends, spoke after Mr O'Connell. He said : " When Ireland asked
</p>
<p>" bread, what did you get but a stone ; and when you asked for the
</p>
<p>" amelioration of your sad condition, you got an Arms Bill, a proof of
</p>
<p>" their total ignorance of your wants and condition. But, if the
</p>
<p>" provisions of that Bill were not of the most insulting and uncon-
</p>
<p>" stitutional nature, and if it did not give the petty tyrant an oppor-
</p>
<p>" tunity of trampling still further upon the liberties of the people,
</p>
<p>" I should care nothing about it ; for we want no arms but our own two
</p>
<p>" arms, and our head to guide them ; and whilst we were more under
</p>
<p>" the counsel of the Liberator, we shall be sure never to make a bad
</p>
<p>" use of them. We shall have recourse only to that moral warfare
</p>
<p>" which tyrants never understood before ; a new species of warfare,
</p>
<p>" a warfare more likely to restore the liberties of Ireland, than all
</p>
<p>" the armies in Europe. We want amelioration, and are anxious to
</p>
<p>" do harm to no one, but to do good for ourselves. Instead of an
</p>
<p>" Arms Bill, they ought to give us another bill ; they ought to give
</p>
<p>" us fixity of tenure, to better the condition of the poor landholders.
</p>
<p>" Our tenants ought to be paid for their improvements, and the
</p>
<p>" landlords ought not to be allowed to drive or distress their tenants,
</p>
<p>" unless they gave leases for three lives, or thirty-one years. I
</p>
<p>" think you like that; that would be a good Arms Bill, that is the
</p>
<p>" Arms Bill we want." Why have I read that extract ? for this
</p>
<p>reason: that whilst it is a part of the transactions at that meeting,
</p>
<p>it evinces the effect produced by Mr. O'Connell's speech, upon the
</p>
<p>mind of an educated gentleman belonging to a peaceful profession
</p>
<p>of men ; and it evinces the clearest exposition of Mr. O'Connell's
</p>
<p>peaceful, honest struggle for the benefit of his country. I may
</p>
<p>think those persons wrong, but that is no reason ivhy they should
</p>
<p>not express their opinions. The unanimity of the crowd in their
</p>
<p>condemnation of Ribbonism is its further illustration. The peo-
</p>
<p>ple give three cheers for Her Majesty. They avow their hos-
</p>
<p>tility to secret societies. They agree to a petition, appealing to the
</p>
<p>Legislature for redress, and yet we are to be told, and you are to

</p>
<p>find upon your oaths, that what is thus enacted in the open day  in
</p>
<p>the broad theatre of a county town, and in the ostentatiously courted
</p>
<p>presence of the authorities, is an overt act to prove to your minds the
</p>
<p>fact of conspiracy entered into with the objects and motives imputed
</p>
<p>to the traversers upon this record. Find it if you please, find it if you
</p>
<p>can. But there is one circumstance in reference to that meeting, that
</p>
<p>requires, and shall receive explanation. I allude to the fact that early
</p>
<p>in the forenoon, and hours before the meeting, and before the arrival
</p>
<p>of Mr. O'Connell, there appeared an inscription or motto, to the
</p>
<p>effect, Ireland ; her Parliament, or the World in a Blaze. True,
</p>
<p>this was not at the place of meeting, nor in a street leading to the
</p>
<p>square, but in a back street; and it was not brought there by any
</p>
<p>person coming to the meeting, but was placed there by some towns-
</p>
<p>man. Yet, we shall go into proof upon this subject. We shall not
</p>
<p>567
</p>
<p>permit it to sully the character of a meeting which assembled for a
</p>
<p>peaceful purpose, recognized by the law, and which M'Namara ad-
</p>
<p>mitted was most peaceable in its demeanour. That inscription or
</p>
<p>banner was instantly ordered to be taken down, the moment it fell
</p>
<p>under the observation of those who took a part in the meeting. One
</p>
<p>of the mottoes erected for the reception of Mr. O'Conneli was :
</p>
<p>Repeal; Justice and Prosperity for all Creeds and Classes. Mr.
</p>
<p>Stewart admitted that the meeting was conducted as peaceably as
</p>
<p>possible, no riot or disturbance, or even a tendency to it. This gentle-
</p>
<p>man, with the natural or acquired keenness of apprehension of a
</p>
<p>police officer, would seem to represent the persons on horseback as
</p>
<p>having come to the meeting with somewhat of regularity, whilst
</p>
<p>M'Namara describes them as arriving in the usual way, as to a
</p>
<p>market; but it is perfectly plain, as Mr. Stewart admitted, that this
</p>
<p>order was necessary to prevent accidents, where a large portion of
</p>
<p>the assemblage consisted of females and children. Mr. Stewart was
</p>
<p>unhappy in his apprehension, both of what was said, as well as what
</p>
<p>was exhibited on banners. When Ribbonism was spoken of, he lost
</p>
<p>the entire thread of the discourse, and he did not see the mottoes,
</p>
<p>Repeal but no Separation, or God save the Queen, surmounted by
</p>
<p>the rose, the thistle, and the shamrock ; and Gentlemen, I trust in
</p>
<p>God, and I am sure I speak the sentiments of my client, that Her
</p>
<p>Majesty and her descendants may long wear that Crown, adorned
</p>
<p>with the rose, thistle, and shamrock around it. Mr. Neale Brown
</p>
<p>was produced for no very intelligible purpose. He states the tempe-
</p>
<p>rance bands passed within about 100 yards of the mound on which the
</p>
<p>beautiful church of Tullamore is situate, at some distance from the
</p>
<p>town. I am happy to say, that the question was negatived, as to their
</p>
<p>playing during divine service. It was half-past two, and no person
</p>
<p>leaving the church states that he was incommoded, although some of
</p>
<p>those may have taken their route home through Mr. Neal Browne's
</p>
<p>field. That gentleman stated there was no riot or disturbance, or
</p>
<p>even a report to him. In fact, there can be no doubt, he added, that
</p>
<p>there zvas no riot or disturbance.

<p>SATURDAY, February 3rd.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Conneli.  My Lords, I respectfully submit to the Court,
</p>
<p>that, as the line of observation which it will be my duty to take will
</p>
<p>not be precisely that taken by any other counsel, and as I know the
</p>
<p>materials Mr. Macdonogh has will take a considerable part of this
</p>
<p>day, if it will not be interfering too much with the course of the
</p>
<p>trial, I should be glad your Lordships would hear me on Monday, and
</p>
<p>not call on me to-day. T can promise the Court that in what I have
</p>
<p>to say, and it is not much, I shall condense still more, if I am not
</p>
<p>called upon to speak until Monday.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  Certainly, Mr. O'Conneli, we shall
</p>
<p>5G8
</p>
<p>comply with your application. I wish to know if Mr. Steele intends
</p>
<p>to address the Court.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell.  No, my Lord.
</p>
<p>Mr. Macdonogh.  My Lords, and Gentlemen of the Jury, 
</p>
<p>In pursuance of the course I chalked out for myself yesterday, 1 will
</p>
<p>proceed to comment on tbe evidence in this case. The meeting next
</p>
<p>in order which I shall call your attention to, was held at Baltinglass
</p>
<p>on the 6lh of August, and in reference to which there have been five
</p>
<p>witnesses examined  Henry Godfrey, Henry Twiss, Patrick Lenehan,
</p>
<p>Marcus Hughes, and John Taylor  all of whom were Constables of
</p>
<p>Police. Theie is something exceedingly suspicious about the evi-
</p>
<p>dence of Godfrey. He deposed to an expression used by some person
</p>
<p>in the crowd, before Mr. O'Connell's arrival. It was when the people
</p>
<p>cheered, and some pigeons rose, a man observed : " This is the shout
</p>
<p>that will frighten the pigeons;" " yes, and the Protestants too," said
</p>
<p>another. This was beside one of the ditches, whilst the people were
</p>
<p>waiting for Mr. O'Connell. Is it not strange that he did not look in
</p>
<p>the face of the man who said this  that he did not ask or take down
</p>
<p>his name, and there was no other human being present whom he can
</p>
<p>mention ? This man was not ordered by his superior officer to take
</p>
<p>notes. He hesitated a long time before he answered that in the nega-
</p>
<p>tive. He saw that a policeman doing a duty, which he was not or-
</p>
<p>dered to do, excites, at the least, surprise. The original notes were
</p>
<p>burned. The process was this, as he said  he copied his report from
</p>
<p>the original ; then he destroyed the original ; then be made a copy from
</p>
<p>the report, and then he made a copy from that second-hand copy, in
</p>
<p>the house of a carpenter, who keeps a lodging-house, and whose name
</p>
<p>he does not know. He had taken a note of the expression, " Devil's
</p>
<p>cure to Saunders ;" but it is not in the transcript. But, what most of
</p>
<p>all convinces me that this man's evidence is not to be depended upon,
</p>
<p>is, the opening of the learned Attorney-General. Tlie Attorney-
</p>
<p>General found, in his brief, a certain statement as instructions in re-
</p>
<p>ference to what a witness could prove, to this effect : " That one of
</p>
<p>" the people said that Father Lawler told them in the chapel, it was
</p>

</p>
<p>" too far gone now, and that they should get it, but not without blood
</p>
<p>" being sbed." Gentlemen, Mr. Lawler was alive  could be pro-
</p>
<p>duced ; and, therefore, the witness did not dare to state this falsehood.
</p>
<p>The fact is incredible that he could have made use of so abominable an
</p>
<p>expression. The next witness produced is Henry Twiss ; he took no
</p>
<p>notes. He was amongst the people as one of themselves, in plain
</p>
<p>clothes, and he gives you some expressions which fell from some of
</p>
<p>the crowd. One of them said they should wait patiently for a few
</p>
<p>months. Now, this witness did not undertake to ascribe a meaning
</p>
<p>to these expressions of an injurious tendency; but he admitted that
</p>
<p>the expressions were about the Repeal of the Union, and that these
</p>
<p>few months did not mean an interval of quiet before disturbance, the
</p>
<p>" time and the hour" have proved. This was a just witness. He saw
</p>
<p>no breach of the peace, or inclination to riot. Everything went off
</p>
<p>very peaceably. We next have Patrick Lenehan. This witness ad-
</p>
<p>569
</p>
<p>niitted that it was publicly known three weeks prior to the meeting
</p>
<p>that it would be held, and that its object was the Repeal of the Union.
</p>
<p>The constituted authorities had the fullest notification of the intention
</p>
<p>to hold this meeting  there was no disguiseor concealment. Thewhole
</p>
<p>country were invited to be present. Everything was peaceable and quiet.
</p>
<p>There was no actof violence committed, noranything like a breach ofthe
</p>
<p>peace. This man reports one sentence from Mr. O'Conncll's speech :
</p>
<p>" I heard Mr. O'Connell tell the people, that he was glad to see them
</p>
<p>there, and hoped they would be all there when he came again."
</p>
<p>This produced great laughter at the meeting ; and yet this humorous
</p>
<p>expression is construed as a sort of appointment for outbreak and mas-
</p>
<p>sacre ! Marcus Hughes is the next witness produced  not to prove
</p>
<p>anything personally affecting Mr. O'Connell or the other traver-
</p>
<p>sers, but merely the words of some persons prior to the arrival of
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, upon being informed that Mr. O'Connell had or-
</p>
<p>dered his coachman to pull up, in order to cheer Mr. Saunders.
</p>
<p>Again, he endeavoured to blurt out what some man said the
</p>
<p>night before, who told him he was going to the meeting; but it
</p>
<p>is quite obvious, that in fairness and good sense, these things,
</p>
<p>even if truly reported, ought not to weigh in the scale against the
</p>
<p>traversers. John Taylor, another policeman, a sub-constable of the
</p>
<p>lowest grade, is then produced, who, not having taken notes, affects
</p>
<p>to give one or two short sentences of Mr. O'Connell's speech : "That
</p>
<p>he would get Repeal if the people would stand to him." "That
</p>
<p>" some of the landlords had tried to prevent their tenants from com-
</p>
<p>" ing to the meeting, but they had come ; . . . . and if he wanted them
</p>
<p>" again, would they not come? and they all signified that they would."
</p>
<p>The plain meaning of Mr. O'Connell in using these expressions was
</p>
<p>to impress upon the people union and perseverance. It was neces-
</p>
<p>sary, upon the one hand, that, in order to signify to the people of
</p>
<p>England the wants and wishes of the Irish people, that he should be
</p>
<p>supported by the people. He appears to have contemplated peaceful
</p>
<p>and constitutional changes through public opinion, enlarging gradu-
</p>
<p>ally into universal will. Union was therefore necessary to repeal the

</p>
<p>Union. But it was said by many that this enthusiasm would abate
</p>
<p> would melt away like the ice before the sun, and for this reason*
</p>
<p>and to demonstrate the futility of such an impression, Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>was used to ask the people, would they not come again, and thereby
</p>
<p>afford to the world the most persuasive evidence that their ardour was
</p>
<p>not evanescent, and that no amount of personal inconvenience should
</p>
<p>retaid them in the pursuit of what they considered a national good.
</p>
<p>It is melancholy to reflect on the perversion of Mr. O'Connell's mean-
</p>
<p>ing which was hinted at in the suspicious testimony of those police-
</p>
<p>men. These men are prone to suspicion ; it is their trade. They
</p>
<p>have sought in vain for anything criminal in the conduct of the
</p>
<p>Repealers. They found nothing in their line. They discovered no
</p>
<p>plot; ten thousand of them are located amongst the millions of the
</p>
<p>Irish people. If this horrid conspiracy existed, if these hundreds of
</p>
<p>thousands of persons, amounting in the whole to millions, understood
</p>
<p>4D
</p>
<p>570
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell to mean what these policemen would darkly insinuate,
</p>
<p>is it to be credited, that no trace of it should be found; that it should
</p>
<p>be like the source of some mighty river, undiscoverable and undisco.
</p>
<p>vered ? I have to complain, that from a county in which Lord Wick-
</p>
<p>low was spoken disparagingly of by Mr. O'Connell, none but the
</p>
<p>lowest and most ignorant policemen, who would gladly do the bidding,
</p>
<p>or gratify the wishes of their superiors, should be produced to muti-
</p>
<p>late, and not report the beautiful speeches of Mr. O'Connell. Let
</p>
<p>me not be supposed to insinuate that that nobleman, or any other
</p>
<p>gentleman would so employ these persons; but there is an aptitude
</p>
<p>in such men to become voluntary tools, and to anticipate or to gra-
</p>
<p>tify what they conceive to be the resentment of their superiors.
</p>
<p>The next meeting to which I shall beg to call your attention,
</p>
<p>was held at Clontibret, on the 15th of August. That was an exclu-
</p>
<p>sively local meeting, having not the slightest connexion, in fact, with
</p>
<p>any of the other meetings. Everyone of those meetings was held
</p>
<p>independent of the Association, with the exception of Mullaghmast
</p>
<p>and Donnybrook. All the others were founded upon local requisitions,
</p>
<p>altogether apart from, but influenced by the same wishes as the Associa-
</p>
<p>tion. At this meeting Captain Seaver, O'Neill Daunt, Mr. M'Mahon,
</p>
<p>a barrister, were present. Pray, why are not they indicted ? Upon
</p>
<p>this trial that meeting is stigmatized as an illegal assembly, sedi-
</p>
<p>tiously convened, and as an overt act in this conspiracy : and you
</p>
<p>have this solecism endeavoured to be made out, whilst those gentlemen
</p>
<p>are not indicted, the present traversers, who were not there, and who
</p>
<p>had no concern in the meeting, are indicted, whereas Captain Seaver,
</p>
<p>Mr. Daunt, and Mr. M'Mahon are not sought to be made amenable,
</p>
<p>and this is only given in evidence against the traversers, because Mr.
</p>
<p>Tierney was there. This meeting was held in presence of the police
</p>
<p>in their uniforms on the platform, in presence of the magistrates 
</p>
<p>the military drawn up at some distance, and yet you are to be told
</p>
<p>that a public meeting, in the face of day, in the presence of magis-
</p>
<p>trates and police in uniforms, is a meeting convened for the purposes
</p>
<p>of a foul conspiracy.

<p>The next meeting was held at Tara, on the 15th of August.
</p>
<p>With respect to that meeting, Mr. James Walker and Mr. George
</p>
<p>Despard were examined as witnesses. Mr. James Walker is a
</p>
<p>respectable gentleman, Sub-Inspector of Constabulary, under the
</p>
<p>orders of Captain Duff, the Stipendiary Magistrate of the District.
</p>
<p>Captain Duff is not produced; Mr. George Despard, who was
</p>
<p>not on duty, but an amateur, is produced. Mr. Walker, as was
</p>
<p>his duty, walked for some hours through the crowd. The entire de-
</p>
<p>meanour of the crowd was peaceable ; there was not the slightest ten-
</p>
<p>dency to a breach of the peace ; there were females at the meeting ;
</p>
<p>there was a good number of ladies. That is the seditious sssembly ;
</p>
<p>an overt act of conspiracy. As to Mr. George Despard, I will dis-
</p>
<p>miss his evidence with a very few observations  that if he wanted to
</p>
<p>be in a condition to disclose the occurrences of that meeting, it would
</p>
<p>have been more befitting in him to have gone to the platform and
</p>
<p>571
</p>
<p>watched the proceedings there, than to be holding 1 a conversation by
</p>
<p>the side of a ditch, and far away from the meeting, with some indivi-
</p>
<p>dual who was not taking an active part in the concerns of the meeting.
</p>
<p>At first I thought that that man's conversation with Mr. Despard was
</p>
<p>not that of an Irish peasant. " I knew by the curl of your lip that
</p>
<p>you didn't belong to our party." But I agree with Mr. Hatchell,
</p>
<p>that that affair was nothing more than a good joke of some clever Irish-
</p>
<p>man, whom I believe I shall be able to produce. You have heard, I
</p>
<p>dare say, of a Mr. Trevelyan, a writer in one of the morning papers,
</p>
<p>who, while travelling in a hackney car, asked the driver what the letters
</p>
<p>" G. P. O." meant, which he observed on the milestones ? The reply
</p>
<p>was : " God preserve O'Connell." Nov/ he was humbugging just as
</p>
<p>the man was humbugging Captain Despard. I hope I shall be able to
</p>
<p>prove to you, that this Meathman was a clever Irishman; and on this
</p>
<p>subject, I refer to a speech of Mr. O'Connell, which the Crown have
</p>
<p>read in evidence. [Mr. Macdonogh read a passage from the Even-
</p>
<p>ing Mail of 19th January.] We believe, however, that it was a mere
</p>
<p>quiz, like " Trevelyan" and " G. P. O."  God preserve O'Connell.
</p>
<p>They produced the Pilot of 16th August on the subject of this Tara
</p>
<p>meeting. The Crown read the speech of Mr. O'Connell at that
</p>
<p>meeting. [Mr. Macdonogh then proceeded to read passages from Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell's speech on that occasion, in which he stated, " that the
</p>
<p>" Union was not binding on conscience, was void on constitutional
</p>
<p> principle, and a nullity in point of law. He said he submitted to
</p>
<p>" that law, but he denied the right of any Government to prevent the
</p>
<p>" Irish people from seeking to obtain its repeal."] I assert that he
</p>
<p>reasons the question of the Union; that he does not invoke brute
</p>
<p>force; that he appeals to the gentry, and invites their aid ; and that
</p>
<p>he enjoins to order, peacefulness, and law; and that his reference to
</p>
<p>the use of force is only contingent, and as resisting oppression  such
</p>
<p>oppression, or such cruelty, as was practised by the barbarous regi-
</p>
<p>cide Cromwell, who first murdered his King in England, and then
</p>
<p>slaughtered the people of Ireland. What was there illegal in trying
</p>
<p>to have an Act of Parliament repealed, or in presenting petitions for

</p>
<p>that purpose, which were adopted at public meetings ? Do you
</p>
<p>not all know that there is at this moment, in the city of Dublin,
</p>
<p>a society which is doing all in its power to obtain a repeal of
</p>
<p>an Act of Parliament, the Catholic Emancipation Act, which is
</p>
<p>nothing more or less than Mr. O'Connell was endeavouring to
</p>
<p>do, with regard to the Act of Union, and the reports of its proceed-
</p>
<p>ings were weekly published in Saunders' 's News-Letter ? [Mr. Mac-
</p>
<p>donogh proceeded to read some further passages from Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell's speech at Tara, in which he called on the people to " violate no
</p>
<p>law, but to act peaceably, quietly, and determinedly." He also al-
</p>
<p>luded " to the Ribbon Societies, cautioned the Repealers from join-
</p>
<p>" ing them, and concluded by denouncing all secret societies, even as
</p>
<p>" traitors to their country." And next referred to the speeches of
</p>
<p>Nicholas Boylan, Esq., of Piltown, and Henry Grattan, Esq., M. P.,
</p>
<p>at the same meeting, in which " they declared themselves to be Re-
</p>
<p>" pealers, while they expressed their belief that being so was in no
</p>
<p>572
</p>
<p>" way incompatible with their also being strenuous supporters of the
</p>
<p>" connexion between Great Britain and Ireland, which they would
</p>
<p>" firmly maintain." Having read the letters of apology from Mr. W.
</p>
<p>S. O'Brien, Mr. S. Crawford, and Mr. E. W. Roche, to the secretary
</p>
<p>of the meeting and banquet, he proceeded to quote from the chair-
</p>
<p>man's speech, in which he called on the " gentry of Ireland to come
</p>
<p>" forward and join him in his struggle for Repeal, stating that there
</p>
<p>" was no fear of Catholic ascendancy, as had been apprehended, be-
</p>
<p>" cause the sole object of the Repealers was to obtain a universal be-
</p>
<p>" nefit for all classes of the Irish people."] I contend there was no-
</p>
<p>thing wrong in stating the Union was constitutionally and legally void,
</p>
<p>nor was there anything culpable in his endeavouring, by all proper
</p>
<p>means, to effect its repeal, when he believed it to be so, and in en-
</p>
<p>deavouring to do so, said nothing unconstitutional, for he told the
</p>
<p>people that he submitted to it as a law supported by time, but at the
</p>
<p>same time he claimed his right to ask for its repeal.
</p>
<p>The next meeting I shall refer to was held at Loughrea. This
</p>
<p>meeting was not convened by the authority of the Association ; it was
</p>
<p>altogether independent of it, springing from a local requisition. This
</p>
<p>was held on the 10th of September. Mr. Rossis the only witness
</p>
<p>brought forward to depose to the transactions of that meeting; and it is
</p>
<p>observable, that Ross and his topical notes are exclusively relied upon by
</p>
<p>the Crown. It would be perilous to incur the chance of contradiction, if
</p>
<p>a second witness were adduced. Nay, even the public newspapers are
</p>
<p>not referred to; but they prefer Mr. Ross's notes, the worthlessnessof
</p>
<p>which is demonstrated by their own intrinsic evidence. Ross, in reading
</p>
<p>his notes, says: "In one instance, where Mr. O'Connell observed upon
</p>
<p>Geo. I., II., III., and IV., he had only topical notes ;" and, also, that
</p>
<p>by giving another passage literally, Mr. O'Connell appeared to say
</p>
<p>what he did not intend to say. The passage commenced, " Ireland
</p>
<p>requires no monarchy." I do not wonder that this falsification of
</p>
<p>his meaning occasioned, in open Court, a start of natural and indig-
</p>
<p>nant astonishment from Mr. O'Connell. But the witness said : " Mr.
</p>
<p>" O'Connell, my Lord, did not mean to convey that Ireland required no

</p>
<p>" monarchy. I would have made the passage more clear if I were to make
</p>
<p>" another transcript." The passage which follows is: "To the Sovereign
</p>
<p>we are attached with the firmness of honest and dutiful allegiance."
</p>
<p>If that man had died, and his notes could be produced in evidence, the
</p>
<p>consequence would have been just this  that Mr. O'Connell would
</p>
<p>have been made to say something very much resembling treason,
</p>
<p>whereas, at the very same moment, he was expressing sentiments of
</p>
<p>devoted and affectionate loyalty to his Sovereign. Bad as Mr. Ross
</p>
<p>maybe, I have from his reluctant lips, the following passages from the
</p>
<p>speeches of Mr. O'Connell at Loughrea. 1st. At the meeting, when
</p>
<p>speaking of the restoration of the National Legislature, he says : "Our
</p>
<p>" motto must be peace, order and law. You use only constitu-
</p>
<p>" tional exertions. There must be no riot  not a single blow ; no
</p>
<p>" drunkenness  teetotalism for ever. Believe me, my friends, that
</p>
<p>" by following my advice, the day is not far distant when you shall
</p>
<p>" have your Parliament restored to Ireland." You are to convict Mr.
</p>
<p>573
</p>
<p>O'Connell for a conspiracy, when he tells the people you aie to use
</p>
<p>constitutional exertions only, and they are to be deemed as overt acts,
</p>
<p>indicating his mind to be then engaged in the prosecution of a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy antecedently formed. At the dinner he says : " In no part
</p>
<p>" of her dominions indeed was the Queen so much beloved as in Ire-
</p>
<p>" land. In Ireland, the Queen's name was a ' tower of strength.' "
</p>
<p>Again: " I hope that which I say to-night will reach Her Majesty's
</p>
<p>" ears. I respectfully suggest to her, that from the settlement of her
</p>
<p>" family on the throne, to the period of her accession to it, Ireland has
</p>
<p>" has received nothing but injustice and injury from them. 1st. We
</p>
<p>" had George I., then George II., then George III. ; lastly, William
</p>
<p>" the Fourth. He denounced me under these circumstances. We
</p>
<p>" hailed the accession of Victoria, and perhaps allegiance to the Sove-
</p>
<p>" reign was never more enwrapt in personal affection and regard than
</p>
<p>" the allegiance which Ireland bore to her age, and bears her still :
</p>
<p>" for we are
</p>
<p>" 'True as the dial to the sun,
</p>
<p>Although it be not shone upon."
</p>
<p>In another part of his discourse, he delivers sentiments not unbecoming
</p>
<p>a man engaged in conferring what he believed to be a benefit upon his
</p>
<p>native land: " And oh!" said he, " may Providence give wisdom
</p>
<p>" to their advisers to conduct them in the paths of peace, quiet tran-
</p>
<p>" quillity, and morality to the temple of that genuine liberty, whose
</p>
<p>" power is securely founded only on religious observances, and moral
</p>
<p>" practices." I confess, I cannot be persuaded to think that the man
</p>
<p>who gave utterance to these aspirations, contemplated, at the same
</p>
<p>time, the horrible project of disturbing the peace of society, and in-
</p>
<p>troducing confusion into the country. I cannot think so meanly of
</p>
<p>human nature. On this occasion, my client, Mr. Barrett, who is said
</p>
<p>to be a conspirator, did not address the assembly. He was not at the
</p>
<p>meeting. He attended the dinner upon an invitation  so did Mr.
</p>
<p>Bodkin, the Member of Parliament, who occupied the chair. So did
</p>
<p>several other persons of station and respectability. Are they conspira-
</p>
<p>tors ? Mr. Barrett was silent. Is that silence his offence ? I pre-

</p>
<p>sume it is : for the peacefulness of the Irish people is said to be their
</p>
<p>guilt! A strange and fearful mode of reasoning is suggested to you,
</p>
<p>upon your oaths. You behold arrayed before you the power of the
</p>
<p>Crown. The extent of that power may be inferred from the fact, that
</p>
<p>even Ross received 400. No money, no pains, no exertions have
</p>
<p>been spared in the advancement of this prosecution. Inquiries have
</p>
<p>been instituted in all parts of the country. The police have been on the
</p>
<p>alert. They are scattered over the face of the laud. They join every
</p>
<p>assemblage; they are domiciled in every hamlet; they have watched for
</p>
<p>the development of some treasonable act ; they have signally failed to
</p>
<p>discover that which they could not discover because it does not exist.
</p>
<p>They have not proved that preparations were being made for this
</p>
<p>imputed outbreak. No purchasing of arms or munitions of war, no
</p>
<p>drilling or training of the people, no military persons sought for or
</p>
<p>employed ; but, forsooth, the story is this : that this very peaceful-
</p>
<p>574
</p>
<p>ness is the worst feature in the case, and that the unarmed and un-
</p>
<p>disciplined peasantry of Ireland are prepared to rise to a man and with
</p>
<p>one accord, to pour their volcanic fire over their devoted country.
</p>
<p>The next meeting was held at Clifden, on the 17th of Septem-
</p>
<p>ber. The only witness to this meeting was James Robinson, a po-
</p>
<p>liceman. He saw a very respectable man, a Mr. Murray, and who
</p>
<p>is considered a wealthy man, going to the meeting. He wore a
</p>
<p>large Repeal card; three times as large as the others. There were
</p>
<p>about 100 mounted on Connemara ponies, some carrying double ;
</p>
<p>some had leather saddles, others of hay or sedge, and bog- wood bridles.
</p>
<p>There was a great number of women walking, and they were all very
</p>
<p>quiet people ; and Captain Ireland was there, but is not here ; whereas
</p>
<p>the policeman, who never left the barracks that day, and who was
</p>
<p>not at the meeting, is produced as a witness for the Crown, to tell
</p>
<p>you that he saw Mr. O'Connell and Mr. Steele going to that meet-
</p>
<p>ing. They did not produce a newspaper to prove the proceedings of
</p>
<p>this meeting, because there was nothing hostile to be found in it,
</p>
<p>and they therefore did not rake up anything from the files of the
</p>
<p>newspapers.
</p>
<p>The next meeting I come to is Mullaghmast, which was held
</p>
<p>on the 1st of October, 1843. The witnesses are : Mr. Bond
</p>
<p>Huohes, Mr. Fleming Mathias Leatham, Mr. Charles Ross, and
</p>
<p>Mr. James Healy  being two Government Reporters, and an as-
</p>
<p>sistant, and one police officer. Mr. Hughes went to the meeting
</p>
<p>openly, in the character of Government Reporter. He virtually ap-
</p>
<p>prised the parties that he came there to watch their proceedings.
</p>
<p>He was received with cordiality, and no reserve was practised ; every
</p>
<p>facility was afforded him to take notes. On the other hand, Mr.
</p>
<p>Charles Ross must have been deemed a person connected with the
</p>
<p>Liberal Press. He had been, previously to that period, introduced
</p>
<p>into the Association by a gentleman connected with the Dublin
</p>
<p>Evening Post ; and it further appeared, upon his cross examination,
</p>
<p>that he had sent reports of the Clifden, and Loughrea, and Donny-
</p>
<p>brook meetings to the Morning Chronicle, and that the report of the

</p>
<p>Mullaghmast meeting was, at least, sent in his name to the same paper,
</p>
<p>and he received the price. He must, therefore, have associated famili-
</p>
<p>arly with those upon the platform and in the pavilion, and had the fullest
</p>
<p>opportunity of judging of the conduct of unguarded men. Again,
</p>
<p>Healy was a stranger from the south of Ireland, selected on that very
</p>
<p>ground ; he mingled with the crowd, he joined the groups of people,
</p>
<p>he minutely examined what was going on, and listened attentively to
</p>
<p>every thing. His own expression was  he listened to everything he
</p>
<p>could catch, and the very worst he did catch, was cheers " for Re-
</p>
<p>peal and old Ireland." He was there from the evening before the
</p>
<p>meeting until eleven o'clock at night after the meeting. Hughes,
</p>
<p>Ross, Leatham, and Healy all concur in characterizing this meet-
</p>
<p>in o- as a peaceful and tranquil assemblage. The language of Mr.
</p>
<p>Hughes is this : " There was a great number of women and children
</p>
<p>" among the crowd at Mullaghmast. It was a movement of a per-
</p>
<p>575
</p>
<p>" fectly peaceful character. He did not, at that large meeting, per-
</p>
<p>" ceive the slightest tendency to riot or disturbance. Whenever
</p>
<p>" the Queen's name was mentioned, it was received with the loudest
</p>
<p>"applause of loyalty." Again, he says : "There were some per-
</p>
<p>" sons with tickets, with ' O'ConnelFs police,' in their hats, and
</p>
<p>" wands ; and 1 think it very proper that there should be such per-
</p>
<p>" sons, and they appeared to me to have the effect of keeping the
</p>
<p>" people in order." Even Ross, who, before he came here, had such a
</p>
<p>horror of Ireland, admitted, that now that he saw the manner in which
</p>
<p>tlipse meetings were conducted, he would not entertain any apprehen-
</p>
<p>sions in coming to this country. He saw no one of the traversers do an
</p>
<p>act inconsistent with their duty, as peaceable citizens, and there was
</p>
<p>not even a tendency to a breach of the peace. As to the Temperance
</p>
<p>Bands, they were not so numerous as Healy has seen at one of Fa-
</p>
<p>ther Mathew's processions in the South of Ireland. He has seen so
</p>
<p>many as 300,000 at one procession, to advance the Temperance
</p>
<p>movement, and forty-five bands, and some attired in unifoim, or
</p>
<p>rather fancy dresses, as Mr. Hughes more fairly called them. These
</p>
<p>bands, too, carried small flags, or banners ; and Healy admitted, that
</p>
<p>these processions and assemblages of persons. in aid of what they be-
</p>
<p>lieve to be the cause of temperance and virtue, are common in the
</p>
<p>part of country where that modern phenomenon took its rise. Well,
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell attends that meeting of Mullaghmast, attired in the
</p>
<p>robes of peaceful and civic honour, as Lord Mayor of Dublin, and
</p>
<p>the first resolution which he proposes is, " a declaration of devoted
</p>
<p>loyalty to the throne and person of Her Gracious Majesty." The
</p>
<p>second resolution is an expression of opinion : " That no power
</p>
<p>" ought of right to make laws to bind Ireland, save the Queen,
</p>
<p>" Lords, and Commons of Ireland." They use the word ought, not
</p>
<p>as the Volunteers of 1782, who said, no power can make laws. And
</p>
<p>then it was resolved, " that we petition Parliament for a Repeal of
</p>
<p>" the Legislative Union between England and Ireland, and for the
</p>
<p>" restoration to Ireland of her native Parliament, and that the peti-
</p>
<p>" tion be presented to the Commons House of Parliament, the next

</p>
<p>" Session, by a Repeal Member." In Mr. O'Connell's speech made
</p>
<p>upon that occasion, he repudiates any assistance from France or
</p>
<p>America. He boldly inveighs against the continuance of slavery in
</p>
<p>the United States, and disclaims connexion with the Republican
</p>
<p>party in France. He adds: " I like to have the sympathy of every
</p>
<p>" good man, every where ; but I want not armed support or physical
</p>
<p>" strength for my country." [Mr. Macdonogh next read several
</p>
<p>passages from Mr. O'Connell's speeches, repudiating any connexion
</p>
<p>with France, America, or any foreign power.] The object of these
</p>
<p>speeches was not to create differences among the several classes of
</p>
<p>the community, but to prevent the Repeal being taken up as a reli-
</p>
<p>gious or sectarian question ; and one of the strongest injunctions
</p>
<p>which Mr. O'Connell gave was, that the people should show the
</p>
<p>most perfect obedience to every form of legal authority. He assured
</p>
<p>them that if they did so, Repeal was certain. And from the whole
</p>
<p>576
</p>
<p>course of the sentiments so expressed, it was impossible for the most
</p>
<p>subtle ingenuity to deduce the foul designs with which the traversers
</p>
<p>were charged. A placard, sold at Miillaghmast, has been adduced in
</p>
<p>evidence by the Crown ; but it would be seen from the speeches that
</p>
<p>there was no community of sentiment between Mr. O'Connell and the
</p>
<p>writer of that placard. The placard left it to be inferred that the
</p>
<p>slaughter at Mullaghmast was perpetrated by Protestants on Catho-
</p>
<p>lics, and Mr. O'Connell distinctly stated that it was committed by
</p>
<p>Catholics upon Catholics. Why did not the Crown produce Hanvey,
</p>
<p>the printer of that placard, if they could connect the traversers with
</p>
<p>it? They produced Browne, the printer for the Repeal Association. I
</p>
<p>refer you to the general tone of these sentiments, as apparent in
</p>
<p>the speeches of Mr. O'Connell, nay, to the very words themselves,
</p>
<p>and I ask you can the most subtle ingenuity discover any trace of
</p>
<p>the foul and dark designs attributed to these traversers upon this re-
</p>
<p>cord ? Further, at that same meeting, he inculcates good will and una-
</p>
<p>nimity between Protestants and Catholics. He says to the people :
</p>
<p>" But do not think that the massacre of Mullaghmast was a question
</p>
<p>" between Protestants and Catholics. It was no such thing. The
</p>
<p>" murdered persons, to be sure, were Catholics, but a great number
</p>
<p>" of the murderers were also Catholics, and Irishmen. But we have
</p>
<p>" now this advantage, that we have many Protestants joining us 
</p>
<p>" joining us too heartily, in hand and heart, for old Ireland and liberty."
</p>
<p>There is no community of sentiment between this and the vile pla-
</p>
<p>card which Healy the constable said was sold at the meeting. That
</p>
<p>paper would fain represent the massacre of Catholics by Protestants,
</p>
<p>not of Catholics by Catholics. The course adopted by the Crown on
</p>
<p>this branch of the case is deserving of observation. The Attorney-
</p>
<p>General called Mr. Browne the printer of the Association. He proved
</p>
<p>that the Association, through Mr. Ray, had employed Mr. Browne to
</p>
<p>print a variety of documents and books, and so, proving authority, he
</p>
<p>read these documents in evidence against the traversers. But did he
</p>
<p>pretend, even in statement, that the Association, or Mr. Ray, or any
</p>
<p>of the traversers had authorized or sanctioned the publication of that

</p>
<p>placard ? No. Although these papers never reached the platform 
</p>
<p>did not penetrate into the banquet-room, yet the Crown calls on you
</p>
<p>to connect the traversers with that placard, and visit upon them its
</p>
<p>guilt. The stratagem resorted to is this: those who have been in-
</p>
<p>stituting inquiries for the Crown must have learned that this paper
</p>
<p>was not authorized by the traversers or any of them. They therefore
</p>
<p>do not choose to call the printer who has affixed his name at the foot
</p>
<p>of this paper. But if the Crown did not think it right to throw the
</p>
<p>same light on this as they did on the publications printed by Mr.
</p>
<p>Browne, at least they might have abstained from impeaching the cha-
</p>
<p>racter of the man whose production they fancied they had thus cast upon
</p>
<p>the traversers. The Attorney-General was instructed to state that
</p>
<p>this man was the printer of all the seditious papers in Ireland. Why
</p>
<p>did they not produce Hanvey? It was unfair to throw the onus on
</p>
<p>the traversers. Mr. Barrett, in his speech at Mullaghmast, stated
</p>
<p>J-  to
</p>
<p>:>i t
</p>
<p>that one of tlie effects which they sought for from Repeal was the re-
</p>
<p>moval of all sectarian animosities. A previous portion of that speech,
</p>
<p>in which Mr. Barrett had spoken of Glencoe, had been used by the
</p>
<p>Crown. You are aware of the circumstance of the slaughter at
</p>
<p>Glencoe. The King's soldiers murdered the confiding family
</p>
<p>of the Macdonalds ; and even the officers killed the children who
</p>
<p>sat upon their laps the night before. The authority for this
</p>
<p>massacre was traced to the signet of the King, a fact which
</p>
<p>constituted the only stain upon that Sovereign's character. Mr.
</p>
<p>Barrett chose to comment upon that, it was his privilege to do
</p>
<p>so. And lie would ask, were the people of Ireland to be de-
</p>
<p>nied the right to refer to history, and form their views upon it?
</p>
<p>That was a speech made in responding- to an exciting toast  the
</p>
<p>people. Men adapt their language to their auditory ; and in this speech
</p>
<p>there is not a sectarian feeling. It is the language of a man unac-
</p>
<p>quainted with the fact of the existence of the placard about the 400
</p>
<p>Catholics. As to the early part of the speech, in which he refers to
</p>
<p>Glencoe, and Elizabeth, his object was to show that the English
</p>
<p>nation were misled as to their history. It might have been more
</p>
<p>courtly to speak of Queen Elizabeth as "the fair vestal throned in
</p>
<p>the west"  but he is not a conspirator, because he has read history.
</p>
<p>I will now come to the next meeting which was intended to have
</p>
<p>taken place: I allude to the intended meeting at Clontarf, and more
</p>
<p>particularly to the substituted meeting, which was held at Calvert's
</p>
<p>Theatre, on the 9th of October. It appears there had been a pro-
</p>
<p>posed or intended meeting to have been holden at Clontarf, on the
</p>
<p>8th day of October. On the evening of the 7th October there ap-
</p>
<p>peared in the Dublin Gazette a proclamation prohibitory of that
</p>
<p>meeting. This was the first direct interposition of the Government,
</p>
<p>and it is obeyed immediately, and with a promptitude which merits
</p>
<p>commendation. It was the prevention of that meeting which occa-
</p>
<p>sioned the meeting at Calvert's Theatre. I pause here, to ask every
</p>
<p>honest mind, whether the instant obedience to the law then dis-

</p>
<p>played, was not the best and truest practical illustration of the
</p>
<p>doctrines which Mr. O'Connell had so frequently enforced. We
</p>
<p>have his intent repeatedly expressed in words. His admonitions to
</p>
<p>observe the law were sounding in the ears of the entire Irish people,
</p>
<p>and he was the first amongst them himself called upon to practise
</p>
<p>the lesson which he had taught. I submit therefore, that Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell's words and deeds are the least fallible indicia to evidence to
</p>
<p>you the intentions of his mind. Well, the substituted meeting takes
</p>
<p>place, and the resolutions which had been prepared for Clontarf, are
</p>
<p>approved of in Abbey-street. They are: First, a declaration of
</p>
<p>devoted loyally to the person and throne of the Queen. Se-
</p>
<p>cond, the assertion of the principle so often contended for, as
</p>
<p>to the abstract right, and a pledge to use every constitutional
</p>
<p>exertion to obtain a Repeal of the Union. Third, a vote of con-
</p>
<p>fidence in Mr. O'Connell; and, Fourth, that petitions to the
</p>
<p>4e
</p>
<p>578
</p>
<p>Houses of Lords and Commons, then read, be adopted, praying for
</p>
<p>their recognition of the unalienable right of the Irish nation to a do-
</p>
<p>mestic legislature, and in order thereto, for a Repeal of the Legislative
</p>
<p>Union. Mr. O'Connell made a speech upon that occasion, in which
</p>
<p>he said that he had two objects  one of which was, to proclaim to
</p>
<p>Ireland that there was but one way of obtaining the Repeal, and that
</p>
<p>was, by obedience to everything bearing the form of legal authority.
</p>
<p>Resistance was not right until legal authority was done away with,
</p>
<p>and the iron and dread hand of power was raised against them.
</p>
<p>Those were precisely the same sentiments which Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>uttered at Mallow. At the Abbey-street meeting he also cautioned
</p>
<p>the people to obey every thing that looked like legal authority, and
</p>
<p>they received the injunction with cheers and cries of " we will."
</p>
<p>He said, " he wanted to carry the Repeal of the Union without one drop
</p>
<p>" of blood  without disturbing social order, but by legal and con-
</p>
<p>" stitutional means ; so that when he came to face his Redeemer at the
</p>
<p>" moment of his account, he would have nothing to answer for in
</p>
<p>" the advice he gave to the Irish people." Mark, we do not read
</p>
<p>this speech for ourselves  the Crown have actually read it against us.
</p>
<p>You will have observed that the Attorney- General selected all such
</p>
<p>passages as could, when dissociated from the context, be brought to
</p>
<p>bear with severity upon the traversers ; and their speeches, stated to
</p>
<p>have been spoken at Trim and other places, were also opened to you ;
</p>
<p>and if you have taken notes of such passages, as opened by the At-
</p>
<p>torney-General, you will erase them from your notes and discard
</p>
<p>them from your recollections, for of them no evidence has been laid
</p>
<p>before you. It is probable that the learned Solicitor-General may
</p>
<p>again recall some of these passages of speeches which are in proof to
</p>
<p>your attention ; but, when you come to consider his text and my
</p>
<p>context, you will not fail to perceive that I have the advantage of the
</p>
<p>commentary on the text, because the peace was preserved in confor-
</p>
<p>mity with the recommendation given by the traversers, whilst the
</p>
<p>construction that outrage and outbreak were contemplated, relied
</p>
<p>on by the Crown, has been falsified by events. Certain sentiments

</p>
<p>of Mr. O'Connell's have been arraigned. He called the Union cor-
</p>
<p>rupt; he pronounced it void in constitutional law. The traversers had
</p>
<p>a perfect right to discuss the Queen's Speech, treating it as the speech
</p>
<p>of her Ministers, 1 Black. Com. 246; but it is quite wild, in the
</p>
<p>present age, to call these things conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, this indictment embraces the proceedings and pub-
</p>
<p>lications of Mr. Barrett for a period of about eight months. He pub-
</p>
<p>lished during that period three times a week ; each paper contained three
</p>
<p>or four columns of leading articles. After all the assiduity exercised by
</p>
<p>the gentlemen on the part of the Crown, how stands the catalogue
</p>
<p>of offences as to him ? Publications of speeches and reports of
</p>
<p>meetings; three attendances at dinners; three or four leading articles.
</p>
<p>As to the first, he did this only in common with contemporaneous
</p>
<p>papers, Saunders, the Monitor, and other papers ; some perhaps in
</p>
<p>579
</p>
<p>a more abridged shape, and others more enlarged. Are they conspi-
</p>
<p>rators? This is a class of matter which proprietors scarcely ever
</p>
<p>see, and which are generally selected by sub-editors, or " scissors-
</p>
<p>men," as they are denominated. In Mr. Barrett's case they appear,
</p>
<p>in the great majority of instances, to have been copied from other
</p>
<p>papers. Is it decent, or befitting, or reconcileable with your
</p>
<p>notions of criminal justice, that reports of public meetings, copied
</p>
<p>and taken from the Drogheda Argus, Kilkenny Moderator, or the
</p>
<p>Freeman s Journal, should be relied upon, against Mr. Barrett, as
</p>
<p>overt acts to prove a dark and wicked conspiracy. Then, as to his
</p>
<p>attendance at dinners; he is charged with having been at three din-
</p>
<p>ners, and his speeches at two of them are all in evidence. He never at-
</p>
<p>tended one of the out-of-door or monster meetings. He must have
</p>
<p>been a very inactive conspirator. As to speeches, he made two in
</p>
<p>nine months, twice as many of leading articles ; the first  a sort of
</p>
<p>introduction to the report of the American meeting, at which Mr.
</p>
<p>Tyler, the son of the President, expressed certain sentiments, the
</p>
<p>adoption of which sentiments is attributed to Mr. Barrett. The in-
</p>
<p>troduction to that article is, in truth, not the act of Mr. Barrett.
</p>
<p>You remember, Gentlemen, the article; it was inserted in the Pilot
</p>
<p>of the 10th of March last. This was a short leading article, intro-
</p>
<p>ducing or referring to the meeting which took place in America. It
</p>
<p>called on Her Majesty's Ministers to pay attention to the fact, that
</p>
<p>the son of the American President attended the meeting and made a
</p>
<p>speech in moving the first resolution, and that his speech was a bold
</p>
<p>and statesman-like effort. That was the passage relied on by the
</p>
<p>Crown as a conspiracy, because Mr. Barrett called the attention of
</p>
<p>the Government to the fact of Mr. Tyler attending a meeting in
</p>
<p>America. The meeting in America was called, in order to sympa-
</p>
<p>thise with Ireland for the struggle she was then making for
</p>
<p>the recovery of her Legislature. [He proceeded to read certain pas-
</p>
<p>sages from the speeches made at the meeting in America, to the
</p>
<p>following effect:] Mr. Tyler said they had assembled there to express
</p>
<p>their opinions on the wrongs of this country. That meeting was

</p>
<p>held at the city of Washington, in America ; and the Crown
</p>
<p>seek to make what took place there evidence against Mr.
</p>
<p>Barrett, and says it is an overt act of the conspiracy with
</p>
<p>which it is sought to charge the defendants. A gentleman
</p>
<p>makes a speech in America, and the Crown fasten on certain pas-
</p>
<p>sages of it, and charge my client with conspiracy for having pub-
</p>
<p>lished that speech. Is that fair or just ? Well, Mr. Tyler proceeds.
</p>
<p> He says: " it is our duty to express our opinions on the force ex-
</p>
<p>ercised by England over Ireland." I would ask, is there any-
</p>
<p>thing unconstitutional or illegal in that ? If so, farewell to free discus-
</p>
<p>sion on every subject. Will it be said that men cannot meet and
</p>
<p>talk on every subject they please ? If you come to the conclusion
</p>
<p>that it was illegal, why then the Government will step in and put
</p>
<p>you all down when you meet to discuss any subject, no matter how
</p>
<p>580
</p>
<p>legal it may bo. Well, you heard that Robert Tyler made a speech,
</p>
<p>and that one passage of it ran thus : " The libation to freedom was
</p>
<p>often purchased in blood ;" but if the jury took the whole context of
</p>
<p>that speech, it was as clear as the noon day that he referred to the
</p>
<p>freedom of America, which was unhappily purchased in blood. Mr.
</p>
<p>Tyler said the Irish soldiers, poets, and writers were the admiration
</p>
<p>of the world, and for publishing this speech Mr. Barrett is charged
</p>
<p>with having concocted a plan of conspiracy. The Hon. J. M'Keon,
</p>
<p>Member of Congress for N*w York, also made a speech at that meet-
</p>
<p>ing, and because you are told it was a bold speech, it is laid as an
</p>
<p>overt act of conspiracy against my client. Gentlemen, I will call your at-
</p>
<p>tention to a remarkable piece of evidence, which is all-important, as it
</p>
<p>is charged against Mr. Barrett that he published that speech of Mr. Ty-
</p>
<p>lerasan overtact ; in fact, they gave the publication of itas aproof ofthe
</p>
<p>conspiracy. But what I, for one, would give in proof, as a substantial
</p>
<p>piece of evidence, would be an article in the Pilot newspaper of the
</p>
<p>12th of April; it was the act of the Association, of Mr. Barrett, and
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell ; and it was not by one act, but by all  by a fair, just,
</p>
<p>and manly view of their acts that they should be tried. [Mr. Mac-
</p>
<p>donogh then read the speech of Mr. O'Connell contained in that
</p>
<p>paper, in reference to the speech of Mr. Tyler, in which he stated
</p>
<p>that the Association should avail itself of that opportunity to explain
</p>
<p>the position in which they stood with the people of America, that the
</p>
<p>value of freedom should not be overrated, but that a revolution would
</p>
<p>be too dearly purchased at the expense of one drop of blood ; and
</p>
<p>that in his time, and while he lived, not a drop of blood should be
</p>
<p>spilled, except it might be his own; and that he wished to exhibit
</p>
<p>his gratitude to the Americans, but, at the same time, to point out
</p>
<p>the species of peaceable support he would receive, and that he sought
</p>
<p>no change that would not be effected by legal and moral means.
</p>
<p>He concluded by proposing that the thanks of the Association
</p>
<p>should be conveyed to Mr. Tyler, and that a letter, expressive of the
</p>
<p>opinions ofthe Association should be written by Mr.Ray to Mr.Tyler.]
</p>
<p>The other leading articles were not written by Mr. Barrett. He was out

</p>
<p>of town when they, orat least the most offensive of them, were written ;
</p>
<p>and on his return he with just severity referred to that article in which
</p>
<p>the murder by Jubee is spoken of with unbecoming levity. He, fur-
</p>
<p>ther, prohibited any future references to the subject ofthe army, or
</p>
<p>any selections from country papers on the subject. I submit that we
</p>
<p>may fairly infer, that the rest ofthe articles in the Pilot during so
</p>
<p>considerable an interval of time must have been innocuous, or they
</p>
<p>would have been relied upon by the industry of the Crown. Then, as to
</p>
<p>the letter, bearing the signature of the Rev. Mr. Power, that gentle-
</p>
<p>man shall be produced. He was no conspirator, and was at all times,
</p>
<p>and is now, perfectly ready to undertake the responsibility which may
</p>
<p>attach to his act. At the time that letter was received Mr. Barrett
</p>
<p>was absent at his country-house. Why should a letter, which was
</p>
<p>printed in his newspaper, during his absence, make him liable to pu-
</p>
<p>581
</p>
<p>nishment ? or how can it prove that lie entered into the conspiracy
</p>
<p>charged in the indictment? a letter, of whose contents he was. when
</p>
<p>written, altogether ignorant. Did that letter communicate the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of my client's mind, and the fact that he had entered into the
</p>
<p>conspiracy ? Quite the reverse, for, as already stated, he knew no-
</p>
<p>thing about its contents. The very concluding language of Judges to
</p>
<p>juries proves my assertion, " that unless they were satisfied of a pre-
</p>
<p>vious conspiracy you aie bound to acquit the defendants." That
</p>
<p>fact is involved in the consideration. It would not do to reach any
</p>
<p>or all of them by arguing in a circle, or to surround the entire of them
</p>
<p>by meshing them altogether ;you are bound on the oath you have sworn
</p>
<p>to try whether there was a previous conspiracy. As to the letter written
</p>
<p>by Mr. Power (and of which Mr. Barrett had no knowledge, and of the
</p>
<p>publication of which he knew nothing), that gentleman therein
</p>
<p>put forth his own sentiments, and which he published to the
</p>
<p>world ; and in doing that he only followed the example of men
</p>
<p>who were equally attached to the soldiery, who had no idea to
</p>
<p>corrupt them, whose only object was to inculcate on them moral duty.
</p>
<p>Then as to his having been seen at the Association on some few occa-
</p>
<p>sions, the evidence amounted to this  no more, that he, as a public
</p>
<p>journalist, received certain remittances, and had the honesty to bring
</p>
<p>them to the place of their destination, the Association. It is quite
</p>
<p>wild to talk of presence at that Association being a crime. Mr. Bar-
</p>
<p>rett, you will have observed, never staid at the Association for a mo-
</p>
<p>ment longer than whilst handing in the subscriptions entrusted to him.
</p>
<p>He never made a speech at the Association in his life. After hand-
</p>
<p>ing in the money, he returned immediately to his paper, and his own
</p>
<p>immediate profession. I do not say this as though Mr. Barrett repu-
</p>
<p>diated the Association, but merely as observing upon the extent to which
</p>
<p>the evidence attempts to connect him with the acts of that Association.
</p>
<p>You will have observed, also, that he had nothing to say to the Arbitra-
</p>
<p>tion Courts. He was not in any respect, either as one of the committee
</p>
<p>engaged in the preparation of rules, or as an Arbitrator ; not because
</p>
<p>they were open to imputation, but because he was not a member.

<p>He confined himself exclusively to his proper business of journalist.
</p>
<p>It was in that character he was invited to the Mullingar dinner, it
</p>
<p>being the county town of a county in which his paper has considera-
</p>
<p>ble circulation. So to Drogheda, as being convenient to Dublin.
</p>
<p>I again repeat, that in making these observations, Mr. Barrett does
</p>
<p>not seek to disconnect himself from the Association, as if it were any
</p>
<p>thing discreditable. Certain matters were put in evidence, with the
</p>
<p>view of trying to damage the Association; to make a unit out of a
</p>
<p>variety of ciphers. For example, Mr. Bond Hughes stated, that he
</p>
<p>produced a manifold copy of a letter received by him on the 3rd of
</p>
<p>October, at the Association, purporting to have been written by Mr.
</p>
<p>Skerrett, from the town of Loughrea. The writer refers to one of
</p>
<p>the Commissioners, who was not a Repealer, and he intimates their
</p>
<p>intention, that is, of the majority of the town's-people, to put him
</p>
<p>582
</p>
<p>out of olVice. What does Mr. O'Connell remark on that? That
</p>
<p>when the proper opportunity should arrive, they would be right to
</p>
<p>put him out ; that is, at the triennial election for Town Commissioners,
</p>
<p>under the Statute of 9 Geo. IV. c. 82. Why, this is the very princi-
</p>
<p>ple of representation, that the elected should represent the wishes
</p>
<p>and feelings of their constituency. He does not say, put him out
</p>
<p>against the law, but when the law capacitates you, exercise your
</p>
<p>rights. I read for you a passage yesterday, in one of Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell's speeches, which were proved by the Crown, in which he says,
</p>
<p>that " no man should be interfered with in the private relations of
</p>
<p>life, for not being a Repealer, only in public relations," by which he
</p>
<p>meant, such as voting for him, &c. This is no more than aright we
</p>
<p>ourselves exercise. If either of our city representatives ceased to
</p>
<p>represent our sentiments, we should speedily, that is, at the next
</p>
<p>election, remove them.
</p>
<p>The counsel for the Crown have thought fit to read in evi-
</p>
<p>dence the Gazette of the 29th of August, 1843. If this were
</p>
<p>offered with a view of showing the fact and date of the Queen's
</p>
<p>speech, it was very rightly referred to for these purposes; beyond that,
</p>
<p>I am convinced, it is not the intention of the Attorney-General to use
</p>
<p>the speech of our Sovereign. I feel assured, that no sort of use hos-
</p>
<p>tile to the interests of these traversers, will be made of that state
</p>
<p>paper. Before the trial of Hardy's case, the Legislature had passed
</p>
<p>a bill, reciting, that a conspiracy existed in England and Ireland, to
</p>
<p>create disaffection, and to subvert the monarchy ; and the then At-
</p>
<p>torney-General for England, Sir William Scott, afterwards Lord
</p>
<p>Eldon, and Lord Chancellor of England, on the occasion of that trial
</p>
<p>said : " I have stated to you, that I may convey to you in as strong
</p>
<p>" terms as I can express it, this observation, that as the proceedings
</p>
<p>" of Parliament ought to have had (and I am persuaded, from the
</p>
<p>" deliberation which they gave the subject, that they had) no influ-
</p>
<p>" ence upon the judicial mind of the Grand Inquest ; neither ought
</p>
<p>" these proceedings to affect your inquiries, or to induce you to any
</p>
<p>" determination, which you are to make upon the issue which you

</p>
<p>" are now sworn to try. Gentlemen, there is no one circumstance
</p>
<p>" of any proceedings before Parliament, with reference to which you
</p>
<p>" ought to suffer yourselves to be influenced in the trial of the issue.
</p>
<p>" It is obvious, that such proceedings as were had in Parliament,
</p>
<p>" providing for great emergencies, may be required and authorized
</p>
<p>" by the genuine spirit of the Constitution, even in cases in which a
</p>
<p>" Grand Jury might not, upon anything that could be offered to
</p>
<p>" their consideration, be justified in finding a bill. It is much more
</p>
<p>" obvious, that in a proceeding before you a consideration of the
</p>
<p>" wisdom and propriety of the acts of the Legislature is not called
</p>
<p>" for. You, therefore, Gentlemen of the Jury, will consider the
</p>
<p>" prisoner as standing before you, in full possession of an absolute
</p>
<p>" right to the presumption of innocence, notwithstanding he is
</p>
<p>" charged with guilt by this indictment, as you will hear, except so far
</p>
<p>583
</p>
<p>" as that presumption is met by the single simple fact, that he has
</p>
<p>" been accused by a Grand Jury of his country. Gentlemen, before
</p>
<p>" I conclude these general observations, you will permit me to say, on
</p>
<p>" the other hand, that if there has been any thing that has fallen un-
</p>
<p>" der your observation, by act or publication  any attempt to make
</p>
<p>" an impression upon the minds of those who are this day impannel-
</p>
<p>" ed to try this great cause, to disparage that advice which, under the
</p>
<p>" most responsible sanction, may be given you in matter of law  to
</p>
<p>" work on your minds any prejudice, either against the prisoner or on
</p>
<p>'< the prisoner's behalf; on the one hand, I am perfectly sure that
</p>
<p>" your integrity will be security to the public that you will not per-
</p>
<p>" mit any attempt of that kind to have any operation ; on the other
</p>
<p>" hand, Gentlemen of the Jury, I am equally sure that I need not
</p>
<p>" ask from an English jury, that they would permit no such attempt
</p>
<p>" to prejudice them against the prisoner at the bar  no, not even an
</p>
<p>" injudicious or ill executed attempt, to influence them in his favour."
</p>
<p>In that case, the Legislature passed an act characterizing the conduct
</p>
<p>of the prisoners as conspirators, yet when the men were put upon
</p>
<p>their trial the Attorney-General cautioned the jury against giving
</p>
<p>any weight in their deliberations to the voice of the Legislature. I
</p>
<p>have adverted to these sentiments of Lord Eldon, in order to pre-
</p>
<p>clude any misconception upon this subject. I am sure that when the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General read this speech he did not mean that it should
</p>
<p>in the slightest degree influence your minds.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury it is a settled rule of law, that when a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy or any other crime is charged, the question always is, whether
</p>
<p>the conspiracy, as actually laid, has been proved by the evidence. This
</p>
<p>has been decided in Re.v\. P oilman, 2 Camp. 233. The jury must be
</p>
<p>satisfied that the acts of the defendant arose from a previously formed
</p>
<p>conspiracy to effectuate the objects, or one integral object, stated in
</p>
<p>this record. 8 Carr. & P., 312. Conspiracy is a fact to be found by
</p>
<p>your verdict, and so is the intent to be found as a matter of fact.

<p>This proposition is so stated by LordErskine, in Hardy's case, which
</p>
<p>you will find fully reported in 3 Erskine's Speeches, 353, where he

<p>says : " Whatever, therefore, is relevant or competent evidence to
</p>
<p>" be received in support of the traitorous intention, is a legal overt
</p>
<p>" act, and what acts are competent to that purpose is (as in other
</p>
<p>" cases) matter of law for the Judges ; but whether, after the overt acts
</p>
<p>" are received upon the record as competent, and are established by
</p>
<p>" proof upon the trial, they be sufficient or insufficient in the parti-
</p>
<p>" cular instance to convince the jury of the traitorous conspiracy or
</p>
<p>" intention, is a mere matter of fact, which from its very nature, can
</p>
<p>" be reduced to no other standard than that which each man's own con-
</p>
<p>" science and understanding erect in his mind as the arbiter of his
</p>
<p>" judgment. This doctrine is by no means new, nor peculiar to high
</p>
<p>" treason, but pervades the whole law, and may be well illustrated in
</p>
<p>" a memorable case lately decided upon a writ of error in the House
</p>
<p>" of Lords, and which must be in the memory of all the Judges now
</p>
<p>" present, who took a part in its decision. There the question was,
</p>
<p>" whether, upon the establishment of a number of facts by legal
</p>
<p>584
</p>
<p>" evidence, the defendant bad knowledge of a fact, the knowing
</p>
<p>" of which would leave him defenceless. To draw that question
</p>
<p>" from the jury to the Judges I demurred to the evidence, saying
</p>
<p>" that though each part of it was legally admitted, it was for the law,
</p>
<p>" by the mouth of the Judges, to pronounce whether this fact of
</p>
<p>" knowledge could be legally inferred from it; but the Lords, with
</p>
<p>" the assent of all the Judges, decided to my perfect satisfaction that
</p>
<p>" such a demurrer to the evidence was irregular and invalid, that the
</p>
<p>" province of the jury over the effect of the evidence ought not to be so
</p>
<p>"transferred to the Judges, and converted into matter of law ; that
</p>
<p>" what was relevant evidence to come before a jury was the province
</p>
<p>" of the Court, but that the conclusion to be drawn from admissible
</p>
<p>" evidence, was the unalienable province of the country." Thus,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the question whether parties harbour specific intents,
</p>
<p>and conspired with particular motives, are matters purely and en-
</p>
<p>tirely within your province. I have to tell you that if you
</p>
<p>entertain any rational doubt upon the guilt of the traversers,
</p>
<p>you are bound, upon your oaths, to give them the benefit of
</p>
<p>that doubt, and to acquit them. The rules of evidence in
</p>
<p>civil and criminal cases are the same ; but the effect of that evi-
</p>
<p>dence in guiding to a conclusion is different. In civil cases, slight
</p>
<p>probabilities are permitted to turn the scale; but, in a criminal case,
</p>
<p>you do not so weigh the evidence, or accurately adjust the balance.
</p>
<p>In cases of imputed crime, you are bound to take the whole case, and
</p>
<p>you are required to declare, whether you are convinced beyond a
</p>
<p>rational doubt, that the party is guilty. The evidence must be such
</p>
<p>as to coerce your judgments to come to that conclusion ; for, in
</p>
<p>criminal cases, there is no race for judgment.
</p>
<p>Something has been said in the course of this trial in re-
</p>
<p>ference to the constitution of the jury. That is a subject into
</p>
<p>which I forbear to enter, for I have never permitted myself
</p>
<p>to doubt the strictness and purity of your judicial decision
</p>
<p>upon this or any other case. Neither shall I refer to the pro-
</p>
<p>bable consequences to this country of an adverse verdict. Mine

<p>shall not be the hand to draw aside the curtain which shrouds
</p>
<p>the future destinies of Ireland ; but this at least I may be permitted
</p>
<p>legitimately to observe, that if you shall not be thoroughly satisfied
</p>
<p>with the case made for the Crown, if you entertain any reasonable
</p>
<p>doubts of this alleged conspiracy, you will by finding a verdict of
</p>
<p>acquittal do more to attach the people of this country to the admi-
</p>
<p>nistration of the law, than any event which has occurred for centuries
</p>
<p>of time. I confess I feel a sort of personal interest in the honour
</p>
<p>which such a verdict will reflect upon a considerable class in this coun-
</p>
<p>try. It would be, in itself, a practical refutation of, as well as a future
</p>
<p>safeguard against, the detractions of calumny, and the Irish people
</p>
<p>will have additional reason to rejoice at having been born subjects of
</p>
<p>the British Crown, when they shall have received at your hands that
</p>
<p>imperishable monument of your justice. And when you shall have
</p>
<p>convinced them of that justice, then let us, in God's name, discuss
</p>
<p>this question with the Repealers. They are no despicable faction,
</p>
<p>585
</p>
<p>but on the contrary, they compose the numerical majority of the
</p>
<p>Irish people. Should the holding of a Triennial Parliament in Dublin
</p>
<p>be compatible with the true interests of the Empire, a British statesman
</p>
<p>may, possibly, entertain the subject ; but whatever may be the result
</p>
<p>of speculations such as these, I think I cannot better or more becom-
</p>
<p>ingly conclude my observations to you, than by humbly imploring that
</p>
<p>Providence, which has been so long the guardian of the British Isles,
</p>
<p>to direct your judgments, and to lead your minds to a just and merci-
</p>
<p>ful conclusion.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn.
</p>
<p>My Lords, and Gentlemen of the Jury,
</p>
<p>It is with unfeigned regret that I feel compelled to obtrude my-
</p>
<p>self on your notice at this stage of the proceedings. I was not myself
</p>
<p>aware until a very short time ago, that that duty would devolve on
</p>
<p>me. I am concerned for Mr. John O'Connell, having with me a
</p>
<p>leader that I am proud to serve under, Mr. Sheil. He is my senior,
</p>
<p>and, therefore, I did not think that I should have to address the Court
</p>
<p>at all ; but Mr. Steele, who appeared at first without counsel, has
</p>
<p>thought fit to change his original intention, and has been unwise
</p>
<p>enough to select me as his advocate, and therefore, Gentlemen, I
</p>
<p>am compelled to undertake the duty which, under the circumstances,
</p>
<p>I could not feel justified in declining. But, Gentlemen, the regret I
</p>
<p>feel is not for my own, but for my client's sake, because I feel the
</p>
<p>honest conviction, that my client's cause is just, and I am apprehen-
</p>
<p>sive that the strength of it may be affected by the feebleness of my
</p>
<p>advocacy. I know, Gentlemen, that it would be unbecoming in me,
</p>
<p>under these circumstances, to trespass on your time at any length,
</p>
<p>and I feel convinced that I shall best discharge my duty to my client,
</p>
<p>by trespassing on your valuable time for as short a period as possible.
</p>
<p>I feel that the subject has almost been exhausted by the learned gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen who have preceded me, and addressed you with such extraor-
</p>
<p>dinary ability. I believe that everything that eloquence, everything
</p>
<p>that wit, everything that sound reasoning can do, has already been
</p>
<p>done, and I tremble with apprehension lest I should, by anything that

</p>
<p>I may say, efface or weaken the impression that I feel must have
</p>
<p>been made upon you by the able counsel who have addressed you ; I
</p>
<p>therefore sincerely regret that I am called upon to address you at all.
</p>
<p>But, Gentlemen of the Jury, as I am bound to do so, I shall abstain
</p>
<p>as much as possible from going over the topics which have been
</p>
<p>already discussed with so much more ability than I can approach
</p>
<p>them with, and I shall, if possible, introduce new matter. I cannot
</p>
<p>introduce much of importance, but I shall avoid, as much as 1 can,
</p>
<p>that which has been already pressed on your consideration, with this
</p>
<p>exception, Gentlemen of the Jury, that at the outset 1 shall repeat
</p>
<p>what has been said by some of those who have preceded me. I shall
</p>
<p>4F
</p>
<p>586
</p>
<p>implore you to recollect that you are not empannelled to try whether
</p>
<p>a Repeal of the Union would be beneficial to this country or not;
</p>
<p>nor whether the discussion of it is beneficial or not. At the out-
</p>
<p>set I beg to impress this on your minds, because I know that at this
</p>
<p>moment there are hundreds out of this Court who actually believe that
</p>
<p>to be the question which you are trying. I know that before you
</p>
<p>were empannelled hundreds, thousands of your fellow-citizens were
</p>
<p>convinced that that was the question to be tried. I know, Gentle-
</p>
<p>men of the Jury, that before you were empannelled this case
</p>
<p>was tried and prejudged by hundreds and by thousands of ho-
</p>
<p>nest, conscientious men, and I feel thoroughly convinced that be-
</p>
<p>fore the facts of this case were opened, before the law of it was
</p>
<p>stated, there were not to be found, in your city, ten men who had not
</p>
<p>formed an opinion on the case ; no, not two ; I doubt if there was
</p>
<p>one; and well convinced I am that honest and conscientious men had
</p>
<p>come to a conclusion as to the guilt or innocence of the traversers be-
</p>
<p>fore they were aware of the facts of the case, or of the question to be
</p>
<p>tried ; thoroughly convinced I am that there is not a sincere and ho-
</p>
<p>nest Repealer who did not conscientiously pronounce a verdict of " not
</p>
<p>guilty" before the trial came on, and that there is not an honest oppo-
</p>
<p>nent of Repeal who did not pronounce a verdict of guilty. Gentlemen
</p>
<p>of the Jury, it is for that reason that I am anxious to impress on your
</p>
<p>minds that that is not the question which you have to try, and that
</p>
<p>it is immaterial what opinion you may entertain with regard to the
</p>
<p>policy of repealing the Union, or the benefit, or mischief, which may
</p>
<p>result from the discussion of that question. It may be unbecoming in
</p>
<p>me thus to obtrude on you in public my private opinions ; but I do not
</p>
<p>hesitate to say, that I differ on this subject from the traversers. I do
</p>
<p>not hesitate to avow, that, notwithstanding all that I have heard, all
</p>
<p>that 1 have read upon the subject, I am still of opinion that a Repeal
</p>
<p>of the Union would be fraught with mischief to England, and with
</p>
<p>ruin to Ireland. I will not say that I have not heard much since this
</p>
<p>trial commenced calculated to shake the opinion which I previously
</p>
<p>had formed ; and I am ready to confess that I should now have much

</p>
<p>greater reluctance to enter into an argument on the question than I
</p>
<p>should have had before this prosecution was instituted ; but still I
</p>
<p>have the presumption to retain my previous opinion ; and, although
</p>
<p>hundreds  aye, thousands, millions of my countrymen honestly
</p>
<p>entertain a different opinion, and although very many of those are
</p>
<p>much more competent to form a right opinion on the subject than I
</p>
<p>am, yet I have the presumption to retain my own. I claim a right to
</p>
<p>retain it; I claim a right to announce it ; I claim a right to enforce it,
</p>
<p>by all legitimate means, and by every argument to urge and induce
</p>
<p>others to adopt it, and to ascertain what opinion is entertained by
</p>
<p>others on a subject so essential to the welfare of the country ; and if I
</p>
<p>find a great body concurring with me in opinion, great in respectabi-
</p>
<p>lity, in numbers, and in intelligence, I claim a right to make known
</p>
<p>that opinion to the Government of the country, and to the Minister
</p>
<p>who holds the reins of Government. Gentlemen of the Jury, the
</p>
<p>587
</p>
<p>right I claim for myself I feel bound to concede to others ; nay, I claim
</p>
<p>it at your hands for the traverser on whose behalf I address you. I
</p>
<p>assert that the traverser, honestly and conscientiously believing that a
</p>
<p>Repeal of the Union is essential to the well-being of the country, has
</p>
<p>a right to entertain that opinion, a right to announce it to the Go-
</p>
<p>vernment, a right to collect the sense of the nation, and to collect it
</p>
<p>in such a manner as will most effectually apprise the Minister of the
</p>
<p>day of the real sentiments of the people. I therefore say again, that
</p>
<p>the question to be discussed here is not whether a Repeal of the Union
</p>
<p>is beneficial or not, or whether the discussion of it is beneficial or not ;
</p>
<p>but it will be my duty to call your attention to what the precise ques-
</p>
<p>tions are which you have to try, without being carried away by irrele-
</p>
<p>vant matter; and for the purpose of applying the evidence which you
</p>
<p>have heard in this case, and to which I with great pleasure have ob-
</p>
<p>served the close attention which you have paid, for without extraordi-
</p>
<p>nary attention the human intellect could not collect from the mass of
</p>
<p>evidence which has been placed on the table the means of arriving at
</p>
<p>a just conclusion, or of knowing what verdict any man ought to find.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, you have heard it said over and over again
</p>
<p>that the indictment charges nothing but a conspiracy, and that is per-
</p>
<p>fectly true ; but I do not think, though the indictment has been read
</p>
<p>more than once, that your attention has been called with sufficient ac-
</p>
<p>curacy to the object of the conspiracy with which these parties are
</p>
<p>charged ; but before I do so I wish respectfully to impress on your
</p>
<p>minds, under the direction of the Court, one or two propositions in
</p>
<p>point of law. My learned friend, Mr. Whiteside, has already told
</p>
<p>you, that originally the word " conspiracy" did not mean anything
</p>
<p>criminal ; it merely meant a common assent to a common purpose;
</p>
<p>but, in legal acceptation, conspiracy implies a crime. You have
</p>
<p>heard it laid down, perhaps, that a conspiracy to effect an illegal,
</p>
<p>or, more correctly, a criminal object, is a crime. You have also
</p>
<p>heard it laid down, that a conspiracy to effect even a legal ob-
</p>
<p>ject by criminal means is in itself a crime. Now, Gentlemen of
</p>
<p>the Jury, I think for all the purposes of this trial, I may simplify the
</p>

</p>
<p>proposition in point of law, by telling you that the law is, that a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy to do a criminal act is in itself a crime. The two propositions
</p>
<p>which I have stated resolve themselves into this one  because a com-
</p>
<p>bination to effect a common legal purpose, such as to procure the
</p>
<p>repeal of an Act of Parliament, is not itself a crime ; but if the par-
</p>
<p>ties combine to effect that by the commission of a criminal act, then
</p>
<p>it is a crime. But what is the crime ? Not the combination to pro-
</p>
<p>cure the legal object, but the combination to use the criminal means.
</p>
<p>To use the criminal means is to do a criminal act. Then it becomes
</p>
<p>a conspiracy to do a criminal act, and that is what constitutes the
</p>
<p>crime. Gentlemen of the Jury, I request that you will keep that
</p>
<p>proposition in your minds; and I shall tell you why I wish you to do
</p>
<p>so. There is no principle in law better established than this  that if
</p>
<p>there be a clear and satisfactory proof of persons conspiring to do an
</p>
<p>illegal act, the act of each of them is not only evidence against that
</p>
<p>588
</p>
<p>individual himself, but in point of law it is the act of the others also.
</p>
<p>I admit that to be undoubted law ; and if, therefore, several men con-
</p>
<p>spire to do an illegal act  for instance, to waylay and assault a man,
</p>
<p>and one of them strikes a blow, the others are answerable for the
</p>
<p>consequences of that blow. But, on the other hand, if several men
</p>
<p>combine to do a legal act, and, in pursuance of the common design,
</p>
<p>one of them transgresses the law, he alone is answerable for his own
</p>
<p>act, and he cannot implicate the others in his guilt. The difficulty
</p>
<p>in this case  if any there be  arises from the law having been loosely
</p>
<p>laid down by the Attorney-General, in the course of his statement,
</p>
<p>although at the commencement he stated it correctly. I know he did
</p>
<p>not mean to mislead you ; I know he is incapable of doing so, and I
</p>
<p>do assure him I do not mean, by anything I say, to cast any imputa-
</p>
<p>tion or any reflection on him, but he did say what was calculated to
</p>
<p>mislead you, unless you had in your minds the distinctions which I
</p>
<p>am sure he had in his. He did say that an act done in furtherance of
</p>
<p>the common object, would be evidence against all engaged in the
</p>
<p>pursuit of it. That proposition is true, if the ultimate object of all was
</p>
<p>itself criminal ; but it is not true, if the common object of all was to
</p>
<p>do a legal act. I think, Gentlemen, that if you keep that principle
</p>
<p>in your minds, it will assist you much in the consideration of the
</p>
<p>evidence given in this case, and help to lead you to a right conclusion.
</p>
<p>Having made these introductory observations, I shall respect-
</p>
<p>fully call your attention to the charges which have been preferred
</p>
<p>against the traversers. The Crown prosecutors have thought fit to
</p>
<p>put eight persons on their trial. They have put on the file of this
</p>
<p>Court what may well be called a monster indictment. They have in-
</p>
<p>cluded in that indictment a vast variety of charges, and they have
</p>
<p>spread over the face of it a vast number of what are called overt acts.
</p>
<p>Of that I do not complain, but I do complain that they have stated
</p>
<p>several overt acts in the indictment, of which they have not thought
</p>
<p>fit to offer a particle of evidence ; and I do complain that they have
</p>
<p>thereby put us to the unnecessary trouble and expense of defending
</p>
<p>ourselves with regard to them, and also with regard to several overt

</p>
<p>acts which they have stated in their bill of particulars, and of which no
</p>
<p>evidence has been given. But, Gentlemen, you will keep in mind that
</p>
<p>your verdict does not depend on the proof or negation of the overt acts.
</p>
<p>You may be satisfied that every one of the overt acts is proved, and
</p>
<p>yet it does not necessarily follow that the traversers are guilty of the
</p>
<p>crime with which they are charged. The overt acts are only evi-
</p>
<p>dence of the crime, they may lead you to the conclusion that a par-
</p>
<p>ticular charge has been proved. On the other hand, I admit, that
</p>
<p>although the overt acts are not all proved, you may be satisfied on
</p>
<p>the evidence that the offence is proved.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, the indictment states that the traver-
</p>
<p>sers, naming them, " unlawfully and seditiously combining, intend-
</p>
<p>" ing - , and devising to raise and create discontent and disaffec-
</p>
<p>" tion amongst the liege subjects of our said Lady the Queen, and
</p>
<p>" to excite the said liege subjects to hatred and contempt of the
</p>
<p>" Government and Constitution, and to excite hatred, jealousy, and
</p>
<p>589
</p>
<p>" ill-will amongst different classes of the said subjects, and to cre-
</p>
<p>" ate discontent and disaffection amongst divers of the said sub-
</p>
<p>" jects, and amongst others Her Majesty's subjects, serving in
</p>
<p>" Her Majesty's army ; and further intending and devising to bring
</p>
<p>" into disrepute and to diminish the confidence of Her Majesty's
</p>
<p>" subjects in the tribunals duly and lawfully constituted for the
</p>
<p>" administration of justice ; and further unlawfully, maliciously,
</p>
<p>" and seditiously contriving, intending, and devising, by means of
</p>
<p>" intimidation, and the demonstration of great physical force, to
</p>
<p>" procure and effect changes to be made in the Government, Laws,
</p>
<p>" and Constitution of this realm as by law established ;" so far the in-
</p>
<p>tents are recited : the indictment proceeds to say : " heretofore, to wit,
</p>
<p>" on the 13th day of February, &c, at, &c, unlawfully, maliciously,
</p>
<p>" and seditiously, did combine, conspire, confederate, and agree with
</p>
<p>* each other, and with divers other persons, whose names are to the jurors
</p>
<p>" aforesaid unknown." To do what ? " To raise and create dis-
</p>
<p>" content and disaffection amongst the liege subjects of our said Lady
</p>
<p>" the Queen." That is the first charge in this indictment. Now,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, let me just ask you, as men of sense, and as
</p>
<p>men of the world, have you any doubt at all as to what the com-
</p>
<p>mon object of these persons was ? Have you a doubt that the com-
</p>
<p>mon object was to procure a Repeal of the Union ? That was the
</p>
<p>real object, and it is not charged as an offence. It is not charged
</p>
<p>that they conspired to procure a Repeal of the Union. Why ?
</p>
<p>Because if that had been charged the indictment could not have stood
</p>
<p>a moment, and you would have been saved the trouble of trying this
</p>
<p>case. A demurrer to it must have been allowed, and saved a vast
</p>
<p>deal of time and trouble. You see the way this indictment is framed.
</p>
<p>Instead of charging a conspiracy to effect the ultimate object, it
</p>
<p>alleges a conspiracy to do that which possibly some might have done
</p>
<p>without the concurrence of the others, although for the purpose of
</p>
<p>furthering the common object. But if you are satisfied that the com-
</p>
<p>mon object was legal, that it was to procure a Repeal of the Union,
</p>
<p>although you should be satisfied that in pursuance of that common

</p>
<p>design, the parties, or some of them, did an act, or acts, tending to
</p>
<p>raise and create discontent and disaffection amongst Her Majesty's
</p>
<p>subjects, that would not amount to the crime here imputed, it would
</p>
<p>not warrant a charge of a conspiracy to raise and create discontent
</p>
<p>and disaffection, because the principle which I have laid down would
</p>
<p>then apply ; that if in furtherance of a legal object, one of the parties
</p>
<p>uses illegal means, that cannot affect the others unless there was a
</p>
<p>previous agreement that those illegal means should be used. But let
</p>
<p>us see what the nature of the charge is. Is it not preposterous and
</p>
<p>absurd  is it not so vague and so general as to render it truly unsafe
</p>
<p>for any jury to act on, or for any individual to say that it discloses the
</p>
<p>commission of a criminal offence ? If there was nothing more in the
</p>
<p>indictment than this charge, the trial could not last five minutes. A
</p>
<p>conspiracy to raise and create discontent and disaffection ! What is
</p>
<p>the meaning of that charge ? If it can be supported in a court of
</p>
<p>law, I ask you is there not an end to all discussion, to all improve-
</p>
<p>590
</p>
<p>ment, to all change, to all amelioration of the law. How is it pos-
</p>
<p>sible to argue any question ? How is it possible to reason
</p>
<p>with any reasoning men, and to satisfy them that an existing
</p>
<p>law is bad, and ought to be repealed without exciting discon-
</p>
<p>tent ? How is it possible to convince them that it is necessary for
</p>
<p>the improvement of their condition that a new law should be intro-
</p>
<p>duced without exciting discontent ? And am I to be gravely told by
</p>
<p>the prosecutors for the Crown, that a man is to be put on his trial,
</p>
<p>and to be charged with a criminal offence, because his arguments
</p>
<p>in support of a legal object may, perhaps, excite discontent ? Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, it is preposterous to say, that such a charge as this
</p>
<p>amounts to a crime. But, Gentlemen of the Jury, you are
</p>
<p>told that the traversers conspired to excite disaffection. What
</p>
<p>is this disaffection ? " Disaffection and discontent among the liege
</p>
<p>subjects of our Lady the Queen." Why, my Lords, that is a
</p>
<p>very vague charge. I have always understood that an indictment in
</p>
<p>which words of this kind are introduced, should allege when and
</p>
<p>against whom the disaffection was excited. Is it to the Queen ? Is
</p>
<p>it to the Government ? Is it to the Constitution? No such charge
</p>
<p>is stated in this indictment. It is a charge to excite disaffection among
</p>
<p>the liege subjects of our Lady the Queen ! I am not quibbling. An
</p>
<p>indictment of this kind should contain charges intelligible and clear to
</p>
<p>ordinary understandings. Let me take it that it means disaffection to
</p>
<p>the Queen. I readily admit that to conspire to excite disaffection to
</p>
<p>the Queen is criminal. But I ask, can you convict the traversers of
</p>
<p>that? Is it disaffection to the Government? What means the
</p>
<p>Government? If it means the Ministry of the day, the charge is idle
</p>
<p>and absurd. I say it is not a criminal offence to excite discontent against
</p>
<p>the Ministry of the day. God forbid that I should live to see the
</p>
<p>day when it would be said to be a criminal offence to excite discontent
</p>
<p>against a Minister ! Is it against the Government in another sense 
</p>
<p>the Constitution as by law established ? Can you convict them of
</p>
<p>that ? What means the Constitution ? If it is the Government of
</p>
<p>the realm, by King, Lords, and Commons, it is consistent with that

<p>Constitution, that there should be separate Parliaments, and indepen-
</p>
<p>dent Legislatures, a House of Lords and a House of Commons in
</p>
<p>England, and a House of Lords and a House of Commons in Ireland,
</p>
<p>with a common Sovereign to both countries. That was the Consti-
</p>
<p>tution before the Act of Union incorporated the two Legislatures.
</p>
<p>That Act did not subvert the Constitution ; the repeal of it would
</p>
<p>restore the independent Parliament, and would leave the Constitution
</p>
<p>as it was. It is idle and absurd to say  it will not be said  I have
</p>
<p>not heard it said  that it would be treason or a criminal offence to
</p>
<p>endeavour to procure a Repeal of the Union, ou the grounds that it
</p>
<p>would endanger the Constitution. Now, Gentlemen of the Jury, what
</p>
<p>is the evidence of disaffection to the Queen ? I will tell you what it
</p>
<p>is. That on every opportunity, and on every occasion, Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell, who is one of the traversers, and the principal traverser I may
</p>
<p>say, never omitted to proclaim his loyalty and devoted affection to the
</p>
<p>Queen, to proclaim it in a manner the most impressive, and the best
</p>
<p>calculated to instil those feelings into the audience which he addressed.
</p>
<p>591
</p>
<p>I protest I can find no other evidence of disaffection. But you are
</p>
<p>told, Gentlemen of the Jury, that a man may say one thing, and mean
</p>
<p>another. No doubt he may. But they who impute crime, who im-
</p>
<p>pute to a man a meaning different from that expressed by his
</p>
<p>words, are bound to prove it ; and it is only Christian charity, it
</p>
<p>is but justice, in the absence of such proof, to give to the expressions
</p>
<p>used, their plain and ordinary meaning, and no jury can act on
</p>
<p>the supposition that the meaning is different from that expressed.
</p>
<p>The expression itself is evidence of the meaning of the person
</p>
<p>who used it. How are you to judge of a man ? How, but by
</p>
<p>his words, and by his actions. What are the words, and what
</p>
<p>are the actions of the traversers ? If the object of Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell, or of any one of the traversers, had been to create disaffec-
</p>
<p>tion to the Queen, do you think the expressions of loyalty would
</p>
<p>have been so often repeated, and would have elicited such ex-
</p>
<p>pressions of applause and assent ? Think you that he would have
</p>
<p>alluded to the Queen's name in such a manner, as to draw from the
</p>
<p>assembled multitudes, thunders of applause and cheers, which made
</p>
<p>the welkin ring ? Think you that these assembled millions were all
</p>
<p>hypocrites ; that the expressions of loyalty addressed to them were
</p>
<p>false, and were contrived for the purpose of exciting disaffection ?
</p>
<p>The charge is idle. If Mr. O'Connell had so base a thought, he took
</p>
<p>the most effectual means to counteract his own object, and so far
</p>
<p>from being calculated to produce the effect which is attributed to
</p>
<p>him, that they produced the contrary effect is beyond all doubt.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I have now done with this charge, it is so idle, and so
</p>
<p>absurd, that I am persuaded that if there was nothing else in the in-
</p>
<p>dictment, the counsel for the Crown would not have stated the case
</p>
<p>to you.
</p>
<p>The traversers are next charged with conspiring " to excite
</p>
<p>" such subjects to hatred and contempt of the Government and
</p>
<p>" Constitution of the realm as by law established." I have disposed
</p>
<p>of that charge by the observations which I have already made. I
</p>
<p>say with the most profound respect to you, that it is impossible to

</p>
<p>come to the conclusion that the traversers conspired to excite the sub-
</p>
<p>jects to hatred and contempt of the Government and Constitution of the
</p>
<p>realm. That they endeavoured to induce and convince persons that
</p>
<p>the Repeal of the Union would be a benefit to the country, is true.
</p>
<p>I admit that was their common object ; but I again repeat, that if you
</p>
<p>could spell out evidence in support of this charge in the indictment,
</p>
<p>by extracting sentences from this or that speech or from this or that
</p>
<p>publication, calculated to excite hatred and contempt of the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment, I deny that that would support the charge of conspiracy, as al-
</p>
<p>leged on the indictment, because you must see that the common ob-
</p>
<p>ject was a legal one ; and if some have used intemperate language
</p>
<p>that would not support the charge.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the next charge is, that they endeavoured to ex
</p>
<p>cite " the said subjects to unlawful and seditious opposition t<
</p>
<p>the said Government and Constitution." The observations whic
</p>
<p>I have already made, are equally applicable to this as to the fo>
</p>
<p>mer charges : " And also to stir up jealousies, hatred, and ill-wiX
</p>
<p>592
</p>
<p>" between different classes of Her Majesty's subjects, and espe-
</p>
<p>" cially to promote amongst Her Majesty's subjects in Ireland, feel-
</p>
<p>" ings of ill -will and hostility towards and against Her Majesty's sub-
</p>
<p>jects in other parts of the united kingdom of Great Britain and
</p>
<p>" Ireland, and especially in that part of the said united kingdom call-
</p>
<p>" ed England." Now, Gentlemen of the Jury, let us deal with this
</p>
<p>charge. It is extraordinary and new to me, that such a charge as this can
</p>
<p>amount to an imputation of crime ; but let us see what the evidence in
</p>
<p>the case is, and on what the Crown rely in support of this charge. Why,
</p>
<p>they rely on certain passages in the same speeches which they say are
</p>
<p>calculated to produce that effect. What are those passages ? The
</p>
<p>speakers were showing and endeavouring to convince their hearers
</p>
<p>of what they themselves conscientiously believed, that a Repeal of
</p>
<p>the Union would be essentially beneficial to this country ; and in
</p>
<p>doing so, they were justified in using all the fair arguments which
</p>
<p>they could think of; they were justified in resorting to the powerful
</p>
<p>arguments derived from the past history of Ireland : and if facts are
</p>
<p>disclosed in that history, which are calculated to produce hostility
</p>
<p>towards Her Majesty's subjects in England, I deeply deplore it ; but
</p>
<p>is it alleged that they falsified or misrepresented those facts, or mis-
</p>
<p>quoted history ? Even if some of the speakers did, that was merely
</p>
<p>a method which they took of enforcing their arguments ; but does
</p>
<p>that support the charge in the indictment, which is a conspiracy, not
</p>
<p>to procure a Repeal of the Union, but to excite the subjects to hatred
</p>
<p>and contempt of the laws and Constitution of the realm. And I tell
</p>
<p>you, Gentlemen of the Jury, under the correction of the Court, un-
</p>
<p>less you are satisfied that these speeches and publications were calcu-
</p>
<p>lated to produce that effect, and that the use of them was the result
</p>
<p>of a conspiracy for that purpose, the charge in the indictment is not
</p>
<p>supported. The next charge is : " and further to excite discontent
</p>
<p>" and disaffection amongst divers of Her Majesty's subjects serv-
</p>
<p>" ing in Her said Majesty's army." Is that charge supported ?
</p>
<p>What is the evidence of it ? Precisely similar to that resorted to in
</p>
<p>support of the other charges in the progress of this trial ; one or two

</p>
<p>speeches on which Mr. O'Connell spoke of the army in terms of high
</p>
<p>commendation, and because he did so, you are told that he is an arch-
</p>
<p>conspirator, and that he is using those "means to excite them to dis-
</p>
<p>affection.
</p>
<p>Some publications were also read, which I do not stand here
</p>
<p>to defend, and were inserted in one or two of the newspapers
</p>
<p>produced in evidence ; one was a letter from a Mr. Power. I will
</p>
<p>not trouble you, Gentlemen, by canvassing that letter ; I care not
</p>
<p>what the tendency of it was; it is unfair, unjust, harsh, and oppres-
</p>
<p>sive, to make use of that evidence against any of the traversers, but
</p>
<p>lim who published it in his newspaper. It might perhaps have been
</p>
<p>(vidence against him to support a charge of libel or sedition ; but the
</p>
<p>lain, the simple, the obvious, the manly, the direct course has been
</p>
<p>bandoned, and a circuitous route adopted ; it is sought to convict
</p>
<p>ie man by the acts of another, and they argue in a circle thus: ad-
</p>
<p>opting the proposition of law, that where the object is legal, the ille-
</p>
<p>gal act of the one is not the act of the other ; and admitting that, if
</p>
<p>593
</p>
<p>the common intent be to do an illegal act, the illegal act of the one
</p>
<p>then becomes the act of the other ; they take the act of the one
</p>
<p>which they say is illegal, done in the furtherance of the common
</p>
<p>legal object, and they use that as evidence of the common intent, not
</p>
<p>to affect the general legal object, but to do the particular illegal act.
</p>
<p>By these means they have brought the acts of persons, over whom
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell had no control, nominally to support this conspi-
</p>
<p>racy, but really and truly to procure, if they can, their great ob-
</p>
<p>ject, the conviction of the great Leviathan agitator. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>I complain of that : it is not fair dealing. I say that publica-
</p>
<p>tions, with such tendencies as these, ought to have been submit-
</p>
<p>ted to you in a clear, simple, and plain form. They ought to have
</p>
<p>made each man responsible for his own acts alone ; they ought
</p>
<p>to have put the question in due course of trial, in a manner which
</p>
<p>would have enabled the Crown to bring forward their case shortly,
</p>
<p>simply, and clearly, and to state to you simply and clearly, what
</p>
<p>their case was, and to lay their evidence before you, so that
</p>
<p>men of ordinary intelligence might be able to say whether the charge
</p>
<p>is supported, and not to involve you in a task which is almost beyond
</p>
<p>the power of the human intellect. The next charge, and that on
</p>
<p>which the greatest stress was laid in the prosecution of this case is,
</p>
<p>that the traversers conspired " to cause and procure, and aid and
</p>
<p>" assist in causing and procuring divers subjects of our said Lady the
</p>
<p>" Queen, unlawfully, maliciously, and seditiously to meet and as-
</p>
<p>" semble together, in large numbers, at various times and at different
</p>
<p>" places within Ireland, for the unlawful and seditious purpose of
</p>
<p>" obtaining by means of the intimidation to be thereby caused, and
</p>
<p>u by means of the exhibition and demonstration of great physical
</p>
<p>" force, at such assemblies and meetings, changes and alterations in
</p>
<p>" the Government, laws and Constitution of this realm as by law es-
</p>
<p>" tablished." The change in the law adverted to is clearly a Repeal
</p>
<p>of the Act of Union, and the conspiracy alleged is a conspiracy to
</p>
<p>procure large assemblies unlawfully to meet for the purpose of pro-
</p>
<p>curing that change by intimidation. That, I think, is the substance

</p>
<p>of the charge putting it as succinctly as I can. Now, Gentlemen, is
</p>
<p>that charge substantiated ? Assuming for a moment, that there was
</p>
<p>a combination to procure a change in the law, I pray you to keep
</p>
<p>in your minds what I said at the outset, that unless there was a pre-
</p>
<p>concert to do that which was criminal; an illegal act of the one in
</p>
<p>furtherance of the common purpose cannot affect the others. Where
</p>
<p>is the evidence of procuring these large assemblies to meet ? Sup-
</p>
<p>pose there is evidence of it, were these assemblies unlawful ? If they
</p>
<p>were assembled, in order, by intimidation in the sense here intended,
</p>
<p>to procure changes in the law, I admit that would be illegal ; but if
</p>
<p>they were not assembled for that purpose, they were legal. I say that
</p>
<p>the mere circumstance of assembling large masses of people does
</p>
<p>not constitute illegality. I admit, that if a great assemblage of per-
</p>
<p>sons takes place, under circumstances naturally calculated to excite
</p>
<p>alarm in the minds of firm and reasonable men, that, without re-
</p>
<p>ference to the object of it, it is illegal. But, I say, if men assem-
</p>
<p>4g
</p>
<p>594
</p>
<p>ble, no matter in what number, for the purpose, as Baron Alder-
</p>
<p>son has laid it down, of stating their grievances, or what they think
</p>
<p>are grievances, and assemble in such a manner as not to excite
</p>
<p>alarm in the minds of reasonable and firm men, that assemblage
</p>
<p>is not illegal in consequence of its numbers. What is proved to
</p>
<p>demonstration in this case? The indictment sets out a large number
</p>
<p>of monster meetings, commencing on the 19th of March, 1843. There
</p>
<p>are not less than sixteen stated in the indictment, and twelve in the
</p>
<p>bill of particulars, making in all twenty-eight. Evidence has been of-
</p>
<p>fered of, I think, ten, but what are the facts? You have, from the
</p>
<p>19th of March to the 3rd of October, twenty-eight of these monster
</p>
<p>meetings  have you any evidence that there was at any one of them a
</p>
<p>single act of outrage or tendency to a breach of the peace ? Have
</p>
<p>you not before you, evidence by persons who attended, on the part
</p>
<p>of the Government, by policemen who took notes of the speeches,
</p>
<p>that these meetings were perfectly peaceable, and can it now be con-
</p>
<p>tended, that they were unlawful meetings? You have this fact, that
</p>
<p>from the commencement to the end of this agitation, if you so please
</p>
<p>to call it, Government was in possession of minute and accurate in-
</p>
<p>formation of every thing that occurred. Have you not this fact also,
</p>
<p>that those concerned in these meetings anxiously and ostentatiously
</p>
<p>published the proceedings at these meetings, their intention of hold-
</p>
<p>ing them, and the speeches which were delivered at them ; and strange
</p>
<p>to say, some of the overt acts in the indictment to support this charge
</p>
<p>of conspiracy are, that the editors of newspapers published reports of
</p>
<p>those meetings. Gentlemen of the Jury, I speak with sincerity  I
</p>
<p>do not, I cannot believe, that if the Government of the country, or
</p>
<p>the law advisers of the Government, did really believe these meetings
</p>
<p>to be illegal, they would have permitted them to continue. From the
</p>
<p>19lh of March to the 3rd of October, they held twenty-eight of them.
</p>
<p>I do say, honestly and sincerely, that I do not think it credible, that
</p>
<p>the Government could have sanctioned these meetings by their si-
</p>
<p>lence. I am sincere in saying so  I make no charge against the Go-
</p>
<p>vernment  I cannot think it possible, that men placed at the head of

</p>
<p>the administration of the affairs of this country could so far forget
</p>
<p>their duty, as to remain passive, if they believed these meetings to be
</p>
<p>illegal, or that such consequences were likely to result from them as
</p>
<p>the imagination of the Attorney-General has depicted to you. I can-
</p>
<p>not believe that the law advisers of the Crown would have sat by and
</p>
<p>permitted them to continue. No other cause can be assigned for
</p>
<p>their being permitted to continue, than a conviction on the minds
</p>
<p>of those at the head of affairs, that they were lawful; and what is
</p>
<p>the evidence that they were not lawful ? I was startled when I
</p>
<p>board it. The evidence produced to show that they were not law-
</p>
<p>ful is, that they were quiet, and that Mr. O'Connell, at every one
</p>
<p>of those meetings, preached and inculcated peace ; and that is cor-
</p>
<p>roborated by the damning fact, that his injunctions were obeyed,
</p>
<p>and that peace prevailed. I do admit, that persons assembling
</p>
<p>in large masses may render it likely that danger may ensue ; that
</p>
<p>men of ordinary courage may entertain alarm; though, in this in-
</p>
<p>595
</p>
<p>stance, it does not appear that they did, hut each succeeding
</p>
<p>meeting negatived the possibility of injury arising from them, and
</p>
<p>gave corroborative proof of the innocence and legality of the pre-
</p>
<p>ceding ones. I can no otherwise account for the conduct of the
</p>
<p>Government, than that, from the information which they had re-
</p>
<p>ceived of the proceedings, and the result of these meetings, they
</p>
<p>came to the conclusion that they were perfectly lawful. The con-
</p>
<p>duct of the Government would have been infamous in the extreme,
</p>
<p>if it had resulted from any other motive. It may appear somewhat
</p>
<p>strange that I should vindicate the conduct of the Government from
</p>
<p>the aspersions cast upon them by those who ought to be their de-
</p>
<p>fenders, but I can account for it on no other supposition.
</p>
<p>But then, Gentlemen of the Jury, there is another species of illega-
</p>
<p>lity attributed in this charge; it is alleged that they procured them to
</p>
<p>assemble unlawfully, for the purpose of intimidation, by the exhibition
</p>
<p>of physical force. Gentlemen, is this charge supported ? I will ask you,
</p>
<p>can you, as honest men, say that you believe there was, on the part
</p>
<p>of Mr. O'Connell, an intention to intimidate, by the exhibition of
</p>
<p>physical force ? Do you not, as honest men, believe that the ge-
</p>
<p>nuine sentiments of his heart were those which he constantly professed,
</p>
<p>as was perfectly justifiable, and that he wished to bring conviction to the
</p>
<p>mind of the Minister by this expression of the people's sentiments?
</p>
<p>I ask you, after all you have heard from the eloquent persons who
</p>
<p>have preceded me, whether you can doubt that the real object of Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell was to announce to the Government of the country, and
</p>
<p>to bring home to them a clear and satisfactory conviction, that these
</p>
<p>were the real sentiments of the majority of the Irish nation? Can
</p>
<p>you believe that Mr. O'Connell intended to march with the Repeal
</p>
<p>Wardens, with their peeled wands in their hands, at the head of these
</p>
<p>multitudes, in order to encounter the artillery of Britain, or to assail
</p>
<p>the House of Commons ? Do you think that he even entertained
</p>
<p>the idea of inducing the Ministry of Great Britain to apprehend an
</p>
<p>outbreak or a resort to physical force ? Gentlemen, the whole life
</p>
<p>of Mr. O'Connell belies this charge : there never was a man who

</p>
<p>wielded such extraordinary power over his fellow-men, but there
</p>
<p>never was a man who shrunk with such abhorrence from the idea of
</p>
<p>leading them to the commission of a crime, or from the shedding of
</p>
<p>human blood. His life belies the charge. The whole progress of
</p>
<p>that successful agitation which terminated in the granting of Catholic
</p>
<p>Emancipation, proved to him the great and beneficial effect to the
</p>
<p>cause which he advocates of preserving the peace, but at the same
</p>
<p>time, of making a moral demonstration which no Minister in his senses
</p>
<p>could disregard. I say, Gentlemen, that he has done nothing wrong,
</p>
<p>nothing illegal, in ascertaining what the opinion of the country
</p>
<p>is. I say he has done nothing wrong and nothing illegal in ex-
</p>
<p>hibiting that opinion ; nothing wrong and nothing illegal in com-
</p>
<p>municating that opinion to the Minister of the day. I say
</p>
<p>he is a weak Minister who would seek to exclude such infor-
</p>
<p>mation from his cabinet ; he would be insane who would shut
</p>
<p>his eyes or close his ears to the acts or the voice of a nation ; he
</p>
<p>596
</p>
<p>would be worse who, informed of the feelings of a nation, would ven-
</p>
<p>ture to disregard them. But, Gentlemen of the Jury, what were the
</p>
<p>means pursued at these meetings ? Every publicity was given to the
</p>
<p>proceedings; the speeches were published and reported. Not only
</p>
<p>did they assemble men to ask their opinions, but they discussed the
</p>
<p>question ; they assigned their reasons, and they published those rea-
</p>
<p>sons, and they let them go forth to the world without reserve. I am
</p>
<p>not here to support those reasons; but if they are wrong, let them be
</p>
<p>answered by something else than by a slate prosecution ; let them
</p>
<p>be discussed in Parliament, and let the assembled intelligence of
</p>
<p>Britain decide on them. Is it to be said that the discussion of such
</p>
<p>a question can be suppressed by a state prosecution ? The attempt
</p>
<p>is vain. I do feel firmly convinced that this prosecution, whatever
</p>
<p>may be its result, will tend to promote rather than to repress the evil
</p>
<p>which is complained of. I trust I shall never live to see the day
</p>
<p>when free discussion shall be put down by a state prosecution. No-
</p>
<p>thing but misery can result from it.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, the next charge is : ' That the traversers
</p>
<p>" conspired tobring into hatred anddisrespect the Courts bylaw estab-
</p>
<p>" lished in Ireland, for the administration of justice." That has reference
</p>
<p>to the resolutions with regard to the Arbitration Courts. I do not
</p>
<p>mean to trespass on your attention, by repeating the arguments which
</p>
<p>you have already heard, as to the legality of those proceedings,
</p>
<p>because if you are of opinion, that the end of those Courts was to
</p>
<p>enable persons to obtain cheap justice, you will surely say that
</p>
<p>is no crime. It is idle and absurd to say, that recommending
</p>
<p>men to submit their disputes to the arbitration of their fellow-men,
</p>
<p>is calculated to bring into disrepute the constituted tribunals of the
</p>
<p>land. It is absurd to say that there is any thing criminal in wishing
</p>
<p>to save parties the expense of proceeding in the superior Courts.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, if proceedings in the superior Courts were not canvassed
</p>
<p> if they were not attended to  should we have obtained the bene-
</p>
<p>ficial reforms that have taken place in onr own time ? Was it not
</p>
<p>by exposing the mischievous exactions to which the suitors were

</p>
<p>obliged to submit, that a door was opened to those advantageous
</p>
<p>amendments. I say it is monstrous to impute crime to a man be-
</p>
<p>cause he complains of the expense incident to proceedings in the
</p>
<p>superior tribunals, and to recommend others to submit their disputes
</p>
<p>to arbitration, and where nothing was to be done except by the con-
</p>
<p>sent of the parties, it is impossible to say that there was any thing
</p>
<p>illegal in this. I should like to have the question tried by an action
</p>
<p>of debt, brought on the award pronounced by these Arbitrators.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the next allegation is, that the traversers conspired " to
</p>
<p>u diminish the confidence of Her Majesty's said liege subjects in the
</p>
<p>11 administration of the law therein, with the intent to induce Her
</p>
<p>" Majesty's subjects to withdraw the adjudication of their differences
</p>
<p>" with, and claims upon each other, from the cognizance of the said
</p>
<p> Courts of law, established and subjected the same to the judgment
</p>
<p>" and determination of other tribunals, to be constituted and contrived
</p>
<p>" for that purpose." This is the same charge, in the very same words.
</p>
<p>597
</p>
<p>I have yet to learn that it is a crime to endeavour to induce persons to
</p>
<p>withdraw their differences from the Courts of law. I have sometimes,
</p>
<p>though perhaps not often, been guilty of the offence myself; and I
</p>
<p>have unwisely recommended men not to go to law, and to submit
</p>
<p>their disputes to other tribunals than those constituted by law.
</p>
<p>Well, Gentlemen, these are the charges which are all included in the
</p>
<p>first count. The other counts are not very material until we come to the
</p>
<p>seventh count, which states more explicitly than the first the change
</p>
<p>in the law which it charges the traversers with conspiring to procnre,
</p>
<p>namely, a Repeal of the Union ; it charges them with conspiring " to
</p>
<p>" cause and procure, and aid and assist in causing and procuring di-
</p>
<p>" vers subjects of our said Lady the Queen to meet and assemble
</p>
<p>" together in large numbers at various times and at different places
</p>
<p>" within Ireland, for the unlawful and seditious purpose of obtaining,
</p>
<p>" by means of the intimidation to be thereby caused, and by means
</p>
<p>" of the exhibition and demonstration of great physical force at such
</p>
<p>" assemblies and meetings, changes and alterations in the Go-
</p>
<p>" vernment, laws, and Constitution as by law established, and espe-
</p>
<p>" dally by the means aforesaid to bring about and accomplish a dis-
</p>
<p>" solution of the Legislative Union now subsisting between Great
</p>
<p>" Britain and Ireland.'' I shall now call your attention to the ele-
</p>
<p>venth count, which is an extraordinary production. It states that
</p>
<p>the traversers conspired, " to cause and procure large numbers of
</p>
<p>" persons to meet and assemble together in divers places and at divers
</p>
<p>" times within Ireland ; and by means of unlawful, seditious, and
</p>
<p>" inflammatory speeches and addresses to be made and delivered
</p>
<p>" at the said several places on the said several times respectively, and
</p>
<p>" also by means of the publishing, and causing and procuring to be
</p>
<p>f published to and amongst the subjects of Her said Majesty, divers
</p>
<p>" unlawful, malicious, and seditious writings, and compositions ;" to do
</p>
<p>what? "to intimidate the Lordsspiritual and temporal, and the Commons
</p>
<p>" of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
</p>
<p>" Ireland, and thereby to effect changes and alterations in the laws
</p>
<p>" and constitution of this realm, as now by law established, Sec." If

</p>
<p>the charge that they conspired to intimidate, by the exhibition of
</p>
<p>physical force, cannot be sustained, is it not absurd to say, that by
</p>
<p>causing large numbers to hear seditious speeches, they conspired to
</p>
<p>intimidate ?
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I have now gone through the charges preferred
</p>
<p>in this indictment, and let me ask you, are you satisfied in your
</p>
<p>consciences, that any one of the charges is substantiated ? If they con-
</p>
<p>spired at all, it was to procure a Repeal of the Union ; but is there
</p>
<p>evidence to satisfy you, that there has been a preconcerted arrange-
</p>
<p>ment, a conspiracy to do any illegal act which is specifically mentioned
</p>
<p>in the indictment ? I confess to you, that at times, in the course of
</p>
<p>this trial, I was disgusted with my own Profession. I felt grieved,
</p>
<p>when I heard men of high intellect, of great information, and of un-
</p>
<p>questioned honour, resort to the species of argument which I heard
</p>
<p>urged in this case. They came down prepared with arguments to
</p>
<p>meet every possible state of facts  prepared to draw the same conclu-
</p>
<p>598
</p>
<p>sion from facts directly opposed to each other, and to ask you to come
</p>
<p>to that result which they wish you to establish, no matter what the
</p>
<p>evidence may be. If at any of these meetings, a single expression
</p>
<p>calculated to produce a breach of the peace had been used ; if,
</p>
<p>as at some of the meetings in England, any person had sworn
</p>
<p>another that he never should be a Queen's man again, how trium-
</p>
<p>phantly, and properly so, that would have been relied on as evidence
</p>
<p>of a criminal intention ! but when we find no such expressions, and, on
</p>
<p>the contrary, expressions of enthusiastic loyalty, we have the counsel
</p>
<p>for the Crown alleging that they equally lead to the same conclusion.
</p>
<p>If declarations of loyalty are not made, you are to infer a conspiracy
</p>
<p>from their absence ; if they are made, they are evidence of a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, and you are told they are used to conceal the treasonable de-
</p>
<p>signs of the conspirators. I protest I know not how any man can
</p>
<p>defend himself, if such reasoning is to prevail. Gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>Jury, I will not trouble you by going through a detail of the evidence,
</p>
<p>but I again beg of you, when you are applying it, to keep in your
</p>
<p>minds that before you pronounce a verdict against any one of the
</p>
<p>traversers, you must be satisfied, beyond all reasonable doubt, that
</p>
<p>they conspired together not only to procure a Repeal of the Union,
</p>
<p>but to do those illegal acts specified in the indictment. Upon what does
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General mainly rely ? He says : " true it is the meetings
</p>
<p>were all peaceable ; true it is there was no outbreak ; there was no-
</p>
<p>thing indicating a tendency to a breach of the peace ; but I see into
</p>
<p>futurity ; I see that the object is different from that which is pro-
</p>
<p>pounded; true it is that no mischief has ensued  why? because
</p>
<p>fortunately it was put a stop to. I permitted the arrangements to
</p>
<p>proceed until they were ready to break out, and then by this Crown
</p>
<p>prosecution I prevented the outbreak." Gentlemen of the Jury,
</p>
<p>if this was not too serious a subject, I could epitomise the statement
</p>
<p>of the Attorney-General, by repeating what I have heard was once
</p>
<p>said by a learned advocate who thus addressed a jury : " Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>I smell a rat. I see it brewing in the storm, but please God I will
</p>
<p>crush it in the bud." Gentlemen, I know not whether his sense

</p>
<p>of smell is equally acute; but the learned Attorney-General hints to
</p>
<p>us that he sees the object of the conspiracy brewing in the storm,
</p>
<p>and by your verdict he intends to crush it in the bud.
</p>
<p>Let. us now consider the effect of the evidence as relates to my cli-
</p>
<p>ent, Mr. Thomas Steele. He avows and approves, and he would not
</p>
<p>permit me to stand here as his advocate, if I did not in his name avow
</p>
<p>and approve of every act of Daniel O'Connell, and perhaps that is the
</p>
<p>reason why he was introduced into this indictment at all. Let us
</p>
<p>shortly consider what the charges are which are preferred against him
</p>
<p>in this indictment. It is alleged that on a certain occasion, on the
</p>
<p>3rd of October, 1843, Thomas Steele made the following speech.
</p>
<p>It is short and I shall read the entire from the indictment : " Sir,
</p>
<p>" I request to have the honour to second the rerolution of the Libe-
</p>
<p>" rator, inasmuch as I have expressed from the first very strong opi-
</p>
<p>" nions with respect to the Loughrea meeting. I have from the first
</p>
<p>599
</p>
<p>" considered that meeting of more national importance than Mullagh-
</p>
<p>" mast, on which
</p>
<p>" Behemoth, biggest born of earth,
</p>
<p>Upheaved its vastness."
</p>
<p>" and for the cause assigned by the father of his country. It was the
</p>
<p>" first meeting showing that the national spirit of Ireland was not to
</p>
<p>" be broken by the Duke of Wellington or Peel, who have traito-
</p>
<p>" rously made their Sovereign the mouth-piece of their villainy, and
</p>
<p>" they have followed it up until they made her the subject of a cari-
</p>
<p>" cature in her own capital. I have looked at a caricature of the
</p>
<p>" Queen by that inimitable caricaturist, the best that ever handled a
</p>
<p>M pencil, who signs himself H. B., in which the Queen is represented
</p>
<p>" as taking the water like a duck, with a bonnet on its head, swim-
</p>
<p>" ming over to France, with Louis Philippe, the perjured tyrant, wait-
</p>
<p>" ing to meet her. It has been represented to be a mere voyage of
</p>
<p>" pleasure ; but every man who has common sense understands dis-
</p>
<p>" tinctly why she was sent by Peel and Wellington, namely, in the
</p>
<p>" undignified position of her own ambassadress, hoiking one day to
</p>
<p>" France, and another day hoiking to Belgium, for the purpose of
</p>
<p>" propping up the fallen destinies of England. Peel and Wellington,
</p>
<p>" who dared to give that threat, were met by the defiance at Mallow
</p>
<p>" of O'Connell ; he defies them." Now, Gentlemen, how was it
</p>
<p>possible, with a serious countenance, to introduce this speech as an
</p>
<p>overt act of the conspiracy? Gentlemen, I can conceive what the
</p>
<p>delight of my learned friends must have been when they first dis-
</p>
<p>covered this speech. At that time Sergeant Warren was enjoying
</p>
<p>a luxurious repose in the Court of Chancery. The tranquillity of his
</p>
<p>mind had not been then distracted by the frightful visions which
</p>
<p>the lively imagination ofthe Attorney-Generalhad conjured up ; in short
</p>
<p>he had not then joined the conspiracy. I can fancy the three sages of
</p>
<p>the law sitting in solemn conclave over this indictment, and imagine the
</p>
<p>delight they felt when, from the mass of newspapers before them,
</p>
<p>they were able to select a speech so full of treason as this, and when
</p>
<p>they read it I have no doubt they formed as satisfactory an opinion

</p>
<p>upon it as the sapient Dogberry himself could have pronounced. I
</p>
<p>will tell you, my Lords, what brought Dogberry into my mind. I re-
</p>
<p>collect to have read when I was in College, that one of the aids of
</p>
<p>memory was the concatenation of ideas: now when 1 pictured to
</p>
<p>myself these learned conspirators pondering over the speech of Mr.
</p>
<p>Steele, the name of one of Shakspeare's plays naturally occurred to
</p>
<p>me ; it was, " Much Ado about Nothing ;" this of course reminded
</p>
<p>me of Dogberry, who is a distinguished character in it. On one
</p>
<p>occasion a watchman says : " I heard him say he received two
</p>
<p>thousand ducats of Don John for accusing the lady Hero w;ongful!y."
</p>
<p>" Flat burglary," says Dogberry. So when my learned friends read
</p>
<p>this speech, "Treason," says the Attorney-General ; " Sedition," says
</p>
<p>the milder Solicitor; " Flat burglary," says Brewster; and having
</p>
<p>found embodied in this short speech treason, sedition, and burglary,
</p>
<p>they all agreed' that it afforded convincing proof that Mr. Duffy
</p>
<p>GOO
</p>
<p>and Mr. Tierney, and the other traversers, who knew nothing at
</p>
<p>all about it, were guilty of a foul conspiracy. Accordingly the
</p>
<p>scissors were immediately put into requisition. Then the speech was
</p>
<p>removed from an ephemeral journal, where it would soon have sunk
</p>
<p>into oblivion, and has had immortality conferred upon it by having
</p>
<p>been transplanted inlo this monster indictment; and yet I can also
</p>
<p>fancy with what feeling the clerk did his duty on that occasion. The
</p>
<p>Solicitor-General's recording angel, with the scissors, blushed as he
</p>
<p>gave it in ; and 1 should have thought that the gentle and compas-
</p>
<p>sionate nature of the Solicitor himself would have induced him
</p>
<p>to drop a tear on it, and blot it out for ever. However, it was
</p>
<p>otherwise ordained, and there it is, doomed to descend to posterity as
</p>
<p>a lasting memorial of the eloquence of Tom Steele, a convincing proof
</p>
<p>of the treason of H. B., satisfactory evidence of the clemency of the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General in not including hirn in the indictment, and a per-
</p>
<p>petual record of the wisdom and good sense of this prosecution. Now,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, is there not some argument in this levity, and is it not
</p>
<p>monstrous, and absurd, and unjust to say, that the charge of conspi-
</p>
<p>racy is supported by such evidence as this ? It is a mockery of justice
</p>
<p>to rely on such a speech as this as establishing a charge of conspi-
</p>
<p>racy.
</p>
<p>I will not trouble you by going through the facts of the case,
</p>
<p>which have been spoken to with so much ability. I rejoice that it did
</p>
<p>not fall to my lot to address you in an early part of the case; I should
</p>
<p>have sunk under the task. I am not gifted with an intellect which
</p>
<p>would enable me to grasp the vast variety of facts and the mass of
</p>
<p>evidence which has been laid before you in this case. But, Gentle-
</p>
<p>men of the Jury, I implore you to consider the vast importance of this
</p>
<p>case. I am convinced that the foul mists of political prejudice, that
</p>
<p>pollute the atmosphere abroad, have not been permitted to come within
</p>
<p>the precincts of this sacred temple, and that you have brought your
</p>
<p>minds to the consideration of this case as free from the influence of
</p>
<p>such prejudice as the judicial ermine itself is free from taint. But
</p>
<p>you are discharging a great and important duty. Deep interest is

</p>
<p>excited by these proceedings ; an interest which pervades Ireland,
</p>
<p>which extends through England, and reaches beyond the limits of
</p>
<p>Great Britain. This trial excites the attention of civilized Europe.
</p>
<p>There is not a city in Europe in which there are not thinking men
</p>
<p>observing the proceedings here, anxious to ascertain whether, in rea-
</p>
<p>lity, that freedom of discussion, of which they have heard such elo-
</p>
<p>quent panegyrics, of which Britain so loudly boasts, in reality exists,
</p>
<p>or is an unreal mockery, a fancied good. Beware how you pronounce
</p>
<p>a verdict that may interfere with that freedom of discussion, or tend
</p>
<p>to suppress the open expression of public opinion. Beware how you
</p>
<p>attempt to close what have been well called the safety valves of the
</p>
<p>Slate ; while it is fearful to think what consequences may result from
</p>
<p>the compression of the steam. Your verdict, this day, will show whe-
</p>
<p>ther the trial by jury is indeed that Palladium of British liberty which
</p>
<p>Britons fondly proclaim it to be ; or the assertion, a vainglorious
</p>
<p>001
</p>
<p>boast. But, Gentlemen, I have no apprehensions as to the result. I
</p>
<p>have the most perfect reliance on your integrity and on your intelli-
</p>
<p>gence. I rejoice to observe the extraordinary attention which you
</p>
<p>have paid to this case ; and I am convinced that your verdict will prove
</p>
<p>that there is not in the civilized world a tribunal to which the accused,
</p>
<p>no matter what his creed or politics may be, can look with greater
</p>
<p>certainty for impartial justice than to a Jury of Irish Protestants.
</p>
<p>MONDAY, February 5th.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell.
</p>
<p>My Lords, and Gentlemen of the Jury,
</p>
<p>I beg your patient attention while I show you, in as few sen-
</p>
<p>tences as I possibly can, and in my own plain, prosaic style, the
</p>
<p>right I have to demand from you a favourable verdict. I ask it with-
</p>
<p>out disrespect and without flattery ; I ask it upon the grounds of
</p>
<p>common sense and common justice ; and upon these grounds alone,
</p>
<p>I demand, as I said before, a favourable verdict from you  being
</p>
<p>thoroughly convinced that I am plainly entitled to it. I do not feel
</p>
<p>that I would have been warranted in addressing you at all, after the
</p>
<p>many speeches which you have already heard ; and after the power-
</p>
<p>ful display of talent that must have delighted as well as instructed
</p>
<p>you ; but, Gentlemen, I do not stand here my own client  I have
</p>
<p>a client infinitely of more importance. My clients in this case are
</p>
<p>the Irish people ; my client is Ireland, and I stand here the advocate
</p>
<p>of the rights, liberties, and constitutional privileges of that people.
</p>
<p>My only anxiety is, lest their sacred cause and right to independent
</p>
<p>legislation, should be in the slightest degree tarnished or impeded by
</p>
<p>anything in which I might have been an instrument. I am conscious
</p>
<p>of the integrity of my purpose; I am conscious of the purity of my
</p>
<p>motives; I am conscious of the inestimable value of the object I had
</p>
<p>in view  the Repeal of the Union ; for I openly assert that I cannot
</p>
<p>endure the Union, because it was founded upon the greatest injus-
</p>
<p>tice, and based on the grossest insult ; from an intolerance of Irish
</p>
<p>prosperity. These were the motives that induced the malefactors
</p>
<p>who perpetrated that iniquity ; and I have the highest authority  an

</p>
<p>ornament for years of that bench  now, although recently, in his
</p>
<p>honoured grave  for saying, that the motive for carrying the Union
</p>
<p>was an intolerance of Irish prosperity. Nor shall I leave it on his
</p>
<p>word alone, I have other authority for it, with which I shall trouble
</p>
<p>you in the course of my brief address  for I assure you I am as
</p>
<p>anxious to be as brief as possible in the observations which I shall
</p>
<p>address to you. As to myself, Gentlemen, I am not here to
</p>
<p>deny anything I have done, or to palliate anything I have done ;
</p>
<p>on the contrary, I am ready to re-assert in Court all I have really
</p>
<p>said  not, of course, taking upon myself the clumsy mistakes of
</p>
<p>reporters ; and not abiding by the fallibility which necessarily at-
</p>
<p>tends the reporting of speeches, particularly when they are squeezed
</p>
<p>4H
</p>
<p>602
</p>
<p>together, for the purposes of the newspaper Press. However, I
</p>
<p>do not hesitate to say, that there are several harsh things towards
</p>
<p>individuals, and clumsy jokes, which I would rather not have said ; but
</p>
<p>the suhstance of what I did say, I avow, and I am here to respectfully
</p>
<p>vindicate it. You know all my actions, and I am ready here, not
</p>
<p>only to avow them, but to justify them ; for the entire of what I said
</p>
<p>and what I have done, was said and done in the performance of a
</p>
<p>high and sacred duty  an endeavour to procure the restoration of
</p>
<p>the Irish Parliament. If I had no other objection to the Union, I
</p>
<p>should find one in the period at which it was carried. The Union was
</p>
<p>accomplished at a revolutionary period ; the nations of Europe were
</p>
<p>overwhelmed with the military power of infidel Fiance. The dy-
</p>
<p>nasty of nations was changed  princes were banished, and kingdoms
</p>
<p>were altered. The revolutionary period had passed with them all.
</p>
<p>Alas, the day of retribution came to every country, restored the
</p>
<p>natural order of things every where; every nation had its full day of re-
</p>
<p>tribution but Ireland, and she alone remained under the influence
</p>
<p>of the fatal revolution ; and you, Gentlemen, are assembled to pre-
</p>
<p>vent justice being done to Ireland, as it has been to all other countries!
</p>
<p>It has been said to me, that I labour under great disadvantages
</p>
<p>in addressing you ; and you may be sure, if I state those disadvan-
</p>
<p>tages, that I do so without any discontent whatsoever. I know, my
</p>
<p>Lords, too well the inestimable value to the public, of the perfect order
</p>
<p>and decorum which should be observed in a court of justice, to dare to
</p>
<p>violate it. Therefore, when I speak of the disadvantages of addressing
</p>
<p>you, you will not understand me as appealing for redress to those
</p>
<p>who cannot give it to me. If anything which has been done is wrong,
</p>
<p>this is not the time to discuss how you have been put into that box,
</p>
<p>this is not even the place for it; and I will now assume, that the At-
</p>
<p>torney-General has done nothing but what the law allowed him to
</p>
<p>do ; because, if there is a wrong committed, the remedy lies else-
</p>
<p>where ; and if all is right and legal, the proper tribunal will decide
</p>
<p>it to be so.
</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen, I will address you, without discourtesy, and, as

<p>I have already said, without flattery, as the tribunal to which I am to
</p>
<p>offer my arguments. It is quite certain that there are considerable
</p>
<p>discrepancies of opinion between you and me, upon subjects of the ut-
</p>
<p>most importance ; you differ with me on the question of the Repeal
</p>
<p>of the Union, for if you did not, there is not one of you would be in
</p>
<p>that box ; you differ with me on a more important subject, in religious
</p>
<p>belief  if you were of the same faith that I am not one of you would
</p>
<p>be in that box. These differences are, perhaps, aggravated by the fact,
</p>
<p>that I am not only a Catholic, but that Catholic who (without boasting)
</p>
<p>has done most to pull down that Protestant ascendancy, of which, per-
</p>
<p>haps, you were the champions, but certainly not the antagonists, and
</p>
<p>who established that equality against which some of you contended, and
</p>
<p>against which all of your opinions were formed; but that does not terrify
</p>
<p>me from the performance of my duty. I care not what evil effects
</p>
<p>may occur to myself, or what punishment it may bring on me, I glory in
</p>
<p>what I have done  I glory that I have been the successful, and you
</p>
<p>603
</p>
<p>the beaten party. I know that I am in your power, but, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>nevertheless, I trust in your honour and integrity, and to that I appeal.
</p>
<p>I said that there were three points on which we essentially differ  the
</p>
<p>Repeal of the Union, my maintenance of the voluntary payment sys-
</p>
<p>tem in everyChurch establishment, and my former conduct in relation
</p>
<p>to Catholic Emancipation. But you are here to administer justice
</p>
<p>and right between all parties, and all I wish to remark is, that I have
</p>
<p>no despair of your doing that perfect and full justice, without consi-
</p>
<p>dering what may be the religious or political feelings upon one side or
</p>
<p>the other. I would have preferred, upon your account and upon my
</p>
<p>own, that those objections did not exist. I would have preferred
</p>
<p>matters were otherwise, and that neither you nor I were harassed
</p>
<p>with the thought that by any possibility, by even the infirmity of hu-
</p>
<p>man nature, injustice should affect the verdict in this case; but I will
</p>
<p>not say any more upon that subject ; I have done with it, and I will
</p>
<p>now pass from it to the consideration of the case itself.
</p>
<p>I first come to the prosecution. Why, it really is the most cu-
</p>
<p>rious  the strangest prosecution that ever was; it is not for one, or
</p>
<p>two, or ten facts that it is instituted, and remember that the criminal
</p>
<p>law of this country is most lauded for its simplicity ; but it is the his-
</p>
<p>tory of nine months you have to go through, the details of no less than
</p>
<p>nine months, a monstrous accumulation of matter flung before you,
</p>
<p>such an accumulation, that I defy the most brilliant understanding so
</p>
<p>to investigate and scan as to take in all the important points, which are
</p>
<p>necessary for forming a sound and just, judgment upon the whole, at
</p>
<p>one view. The great difficulty created in this case was bringing such
</p>
<p>an immense quantity of matter under your consideration; it is impos-
</p>
<p>sible for the human memory not to fail ; for it is always apt to re-
</p>
<p>collect that which is strongest and most striking, while it is equally
</p>
<p>prone to forget that which ought to be the most important to a jury 
</p>
<p>the exculpatory and mitigatory matter. Gentlemen of the Jury, I
</p>
<p>arraign this prosecution, not with hostility or anger, but on constitu-
</p>
<p>tional principles: it is utterly impossible for you to find out or distin-
</p>
<p>guish from that mighty mass of matter which was laid before you,

</p>
<p>what really is the question you have to try. Let me see whether I can
</p>
<p>help you. I will first endeavour to see how much is affirmative in this
</p>
<p>prosecution, and how much and what negations it contains. I will, as I
</p>
<p>tell you, endeavour to discover what is affirmative in it, and next I
</p>
<p>will try to find out the negative quantities and qualities it possesses,
</p>
<p>that is, I will see what it is, and what it is not. Its entire strength con-
</p>
<p>sists in that cabalistic word " conspiracy." If, my Lords, I look into
</p>
<p>the dictionary for the meaning of that word, I find that it is " a secret
</p>
<p>agreement between several to commit a crime," and that is the ra-
</p>
<p>tional, common-sense definition of it. This word, however, in recent
</p>
<p>times, has been taken under special protection by the Bar, and the de-
</p>
<p>finition of it now is, not only an agreement between several to commit
</p>
<p>crime, but they have taken two hooks to their line, and the further de-
</p>
<p>scription of it is to effect, or attempt to effect, even a legal object by
</p>
<p>means that are considered illegal ; and thus a " conspiracy" is spelt
</p>
<p>out by the construction put upon the means that are used to attain
</p>
<p>604
</p>
<p>the object sought, however legitimate that object may be. How-
</p>
<p>ever, whatever opinion I may form of the first definition given
</p>
<p>of ' conspiracy," I do not think there is much of justice in the
</p>
<p>second branch, or that, at all events, it ought to be brought under
</p>
<p>your consideration, unless the offence was so clear and distinct as
</p>
<p>to be a substantial offence in itself, that it need not be spelt out in this
</p>
<p>way, if the ends sought were legitimate. Well now, let us take the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy as it is, and let us see whether there are any negative qua-
</p>
<p>lities belonging to the evidence produced by the Crown. It has been
</p>
<p>admitted, even by the Crown, that in this case there is no privacy,
</p>
<p>no secrecy, no definite agreement, to do any thing whatsoever, but
</p>
<p>above all no secret agreement  no secret society  no private infor-
</p>
<p>mation. It has been admitted by the Crown that there has not been
</p>
<p>even one act of private communication  that every thing was openly
</p>
<p>avowed, proclaimed, and published to the world  that this "secret
</p>
<p>conspiracy" lias no secrecy at all. And the fact is so : for, Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, the evidence of our acts, as laid before you, was to be found in
</p>
<p>the Dublin Evening Mail, as well as in the Dublin Evening Post ;
</p>
<p>and this charge of " conspiracy" was raked up from that most secret
</p>
<p>abyss, that most secret channel, the public newspapers. Really it is
</p>
<p>too ridiculous to be defending one's self from a charge of this sort.
</p>
<p>Every act was done before the world ; these meetings were convened
</p>
<p>by public advertisements, with a bell ringing to invite people to at-
</p>
<p>tend ; and yet those who did so have entered into a " private" con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. To constitute a conspiracy there should be an agreement ;
</p>
<p>whether necessarily private is another question ; but there should be
</p>
<p>something concealed. It should not be an agreement, for instance, in
</p>
<p>ihe presence of the Attorney-General, or Solicitor-General, or of
</p>
<p>Her Majesty's Sergeants. What a monstrous thing it is to call that
</p>
<p>a conspiracy which every body knew of, every body heard of, and
</p>
<p>three-fifths of the people of this country were engaged in. And what
</p>
<p>was the evidence that those conspirators assembled together ?  -That
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett attended at such a meeting ; and that Mr. Duffy at-
</p>
<p>tended once or twice ; and that I myself attended; and this is the

</p>
<p>way the charge of conspiracy is to be spelt out. Is it common sense ?
</p>
<p>Is it to be endured, that that should be denominated a conspiracy ?
</p>
<p>Conspiracy ! Where was it made ? When was it made ? How was it
</p>
<p>made? Was it made in winter, or in summer, in spring or in autumn?
</p>
<p>Was it made on a holyday, or on a Sunday, or on a weekday ? Tell me
</p>
<p>the hour, the week, the month, the year it was made ? In which of the
</p>
<p>three quarters of the nine months did the gestation of this conspiracy
</p>
<p>commence ? Who proposed it ? Who seconded it ? Who was present
</p>
<p>at it? Gentlemen, I appealtoyourcommon sense  toyourreason ; place
</p>
<p>yourselves foronemoment in my position; suppose yourselves address-
</p>
<p>ing a Catholic jury. Consider for one moment, and see how you would
</p>
<p>feel, and with what conscious integrity you would laugh to scorn the
</p>
<p>opinions of that jury, who would dare to find you guilty of a conspi-
</p>
<p>racy, under such circumstances. You have neither time, place, nor
</p>
<p>an individual with whom any secret communication was had  not
</p>
<p>the slightest shred of evidence of that fact  not the slightest par-
</p>
<p>G05
</p>
<p>tide of evidence which could sustain a charge of that nature.
</p>
<p>I do not know whether it was said that I was present at the concoc-
</p>
<p>tion of this conspiracy, at this agreement, private or puhlic ; who
</p>
<p>else was there? When and where did it take place? Ought I not
</p>
<p>at all events to have the advantage of heing ahle to prove an alibi P
</p>
<p>No, but you must go over nine months, and toss up whicli place or
</p>
<p>time you may select. I want to know whether this agreement was
</p>
<p>in writing or in mere parol? If an action at Nisi Prius was pend-
</p>
<p>ing, and you were to try it, and that that action was for the recovery
</p>
<p>of a ten pound contract, could it be possible you could find that such a
</p>
<p>contract existed upon such vague evidence as that adduced in this case?
</p>
<p>I remember it was said of a Judge who has long since passed away,
</p>
<p>that in a case for the recovery of ten pounds before him, one of the
</p>
<p>counsel observed, that, although the evidence was not sufficient in a
</p>
<p>civil case, it would be quite sufficient in a criminal case in his lord-
</p>
<p>ship's court. And in this case I say to you that there is not evidence
</p>
<p>enough to support an action for the recovery of ten pounds. Is this
</p>
<p>agreement with which we are charged in the bill of particulars ?
</p>
<p>How is the charge described? There are so many of them it is
</p>
<p>almost impossible to say ; but why should we be charged with en-
</p>
<p>tering into an agreement (whether it should be private or not is
</p>
<p>another question), and not have that charge set out in the bill of
</p>
<p>particulars? My Lords, I do not mean to waive my right to the
</p>
<p>benefit of that point. I say this charge is not in the bill of particu-
</p>
<p>lars. If it was in writing, it should be given in evidence ; but the
</p>
<p>Crown are now concluded by the omission of it in their particulars.
</p>
<p>Why should that escape your notice  your honest, impartial, con-
</p>
<p>scientious view ? Do you not believe that if there was a conspiracy,
</p>
<p>it would be proved, and that the only reason it was not proved, is be-
</p>
<p>cause it did not exist. The Attorney-General told you it did exist 
</p>
<p>that it must have existed ; but this is all imaginary, and you are
</p>
<p>called upon to find me guilty, if you " imagine" that, this agreement
</p>
<p>was entered into. I do not want to speak disparagingly of the ta-
</p>
<p>lents of the Attorney-General. I admit the ingenuity, the talent,

</p>
<p>and the industry with which he conducted this case. He was eleven
</p>
<p>hours  eleven mortal hours in laying the facts of it before you.
</p>
<p>What did he tell you the conspiracy consisted of? He made a long
</p>
<p>statement, and when he came to the end he told you to go back to
</p>
<p>the beginning and find out the conspiracy, and what it consisted of.
</p>
<p>I say, Gentlemen of the Jury, without the least affectation, if any
</p>
<p>gentleman could have found evidence of a conspiracy, it would have
</p>
<p>been found by the Attorney-General. Yes, he took eleven hours to
</p>
<p>throw all that garbage into your box. There, said he, is the Pilot
</p>
<p>and the Nation for you, and make out a conspiracy. I remember,
</p>
<p>on the Minister circuit, the celebrated Mr. Egan was engaged
</p>
<p>for a defendant. The case had been stated by a Mr. Hoare, a gen-
</p>
<p>tleman of dark appearance. Egan was sure of his jury ; and on behalf
</p>
<p>of his client he merely said: " Gentlemen of the Jury, you are not,
</p>
<p>" in deciding this case, to be influenced by the dark oblivion of a
</p>
<p>'brow." A learned friend sitting near him, said :" Why, Egan,
</p>
<p>GOG
</p>
<p>what do you mean ; that is nonsense you have been speaking."
</p>
<p>" To be sure it is," said Egan, " but it is good enough for the jury."
</p>
<p>So, eleven hours are good enough for you, Gentlemen. It is nonsense
</p>
<p>to talk of a conspiracy which takes eleven hours to develope it. 1 re-
</p>
<p>member, after Hardy was tried for constructive high treason, the anni-
</p>
<p>versary of his acquittal was for a long time celebrated by a dinner ; and
</p>
<p>one of the jury, whose health was regularly proposed, always made
</p>
<p>the same speech : " Mr. Chairman and gentlemen," said he, " I will tell
</p>
<p>" you why I acquitted Mr. Hardy  Mr. Sergeant Scott took eleven
</p>
<p>" hours to state the case, and ten days were spent in endeavouring to
</p>
<p>" prove it. Now, I knew no man could be guilty whose guilt it took
</p>
<p>" such a long time to show. Bring a case of treason, and I will
</p>
<p>"convict a man, but I will not help an Attorney-General to make out
</p>
<p>" a case for the Crown." That was his common-sense view of the case.
</p>
<p>If a conspiracy existed, the Attorney-General would not have taken
</p>
<p>an hour, or half an hour to state it, he would have stripped it of its
</p>
<p>garbage. If there was a conspiracy, he has ingenuity and talent
</p>
<p>enough to have shown its existence in an hour and a-half at the ut-
</p>
<p>most, even giving full play to the verbiage of the Bar, for which,
</p>
<p>though not in my wig and gown, I have still a fellow-feeling. If it
</p>
<p>existed, unquestionably he would have shown you when, where, how ;
</p>
<p>he would have given you all the particulars of it. He, however, has
</p>
<p>given you none ; he made out none ; lie has left that to you ; it was
</p>
<p>good enough for you. Remember that, in this alleged conspiracy,
</p>
<p>there is no secrecy imputed ; nothing is left to conjecture ; the entire
</p>
<p>is before you ; and therefore, as you know it all, there never was a
</p>
<p>cause in which the Attorney- General was less entitled to ask a jury
</p>
<p>to spell out something beyond the case  indeed it must be some-
</p>
<p>thing curious which is beyond the entire. I am quite right in say-
</p>
<p>ing, you know it all. Why, before the trial, the whole country
</p>
<p>was full of rumours of the existence of a dark conspiracy, and of the
</p>
<p>disclosures made by persons who were said to have betrayed the con-
</p>
<p>spirators  that they had a clue to everything. No less than seven
</p>
<p>persons were pointed out to me, as having betrayed the secrets and

</p>
<p>plans to the Government. One was pointed out as having been
</p>
<p>seen going to Mr. Kemmis, the Crown Solicitor, another as having
</p>
<p>been at the Castle, and a third as having been at a certain house,
</p>
<p>not far from Mr. Brewster's residence in Merrion-square ; no less
</p>
<p>than seven persons suffered in their characters by these rumours of
</p>
<p>treachery on their parts. I merely said, " do not mind these reports ;
</p>
<p>" what can they disclose when there is nothing to betray? They may
</p>
<p>" invent, but they have no secrets of ours to disclose." Now, I ask
</p>
<p>you, when you came into that box, did you not expect to have heard
</p>
<p>something you had not heard before? Did you not expect to have
</p>
<p>some plot discovered, some secret machination influencing and con-
</p>
<p>tradicting the nature of our public acts ? If you did expect it, was
</p>
<p>there ever disappointment so complete and unmitigated ? Why,
</p>
<p>throughout the city, in the clubs, when the Attorney-General's case
</p>
<p>was closed, everybody said, "is that all, why we knew all that be-
</p>
<p>fore." 'Tis a conspiracy! Yes, Gentlemen, what has becom of
</p>
<p>607
</p>
<p>these secret plans, the proofs of this dark conspiracy, these "Gorgons
</p>
<p>and chimeras dire" of the imagination, what has become of them ? Va-
</p>
<p>nished ; nothing to be disclosed  nothing concealed. It would have
</p>
<p>been the duty of the Government to have proved them if they could
</p>
<p>have done so. They had money enough to enable them to get at the
</p>
<p>secrets if they existed. They had the disposition, too, for it was
</p>
<p>their interest to do so. We cannot conceal from ourselves that this
</p>
<p>is not a case merely confined to the charge of conspiracy ; it is a kind
</p>
<p>of ministerial trial, to see whether this Ministry, with their conciliation
</p>
<p>policy, with their proposal for an extended franchise in Ireland,
</p>
<p>are to retain office, or whether we are to have the Whigs again,
</p>
<p>promising a good deal, and doing very little. That is the real question
</p>
<p>to be tried. You, therefore, see what interest they had in forward-
</p>
<p>ing this case ; the strong stake, the interest they had to discover the
</p>
<p>real facts, and to bring this monstrous conspiracy to the light of day.
</p>
<p>No man could have a stronger motive in conducting this prosecution
</p>
<p>than the Attorney-General  no man has so totally failed, and why?
</p>
<p>The reason was clear, because they had nothing to betray. It is im-
</p>
<p>possible the Government could have failed to discover all the secrets
</p>
<p>and plans, if any existed. They had influence enough to induce per-
</p>
<p>sons to betray. They had the patronage in the Post- Office, in the
</p>
<p>revenue police, and especially in the constabulary, to offer for infor-
</p>
<p>mation ; yet they procure none. Why ? because there was nothing
</p>
<p>to betray ; and you know it.
</p>
<p>Well, then, what is the evidence? If there was nothing new,
</p>
<p>what was the old evidence ? The life of an old coat, they say, is a
</p>
<p>new button. They have stitched up their case with the newspapers
</p>
<p>which they have flung before you. The evidence consists of two
</p>
<p>things. First, of the meetings which have taken place, and next, of
</p>
<p>the newspapers. To spell out an undefined conspiracy existing in the
</p>
<p>imagination, without date, place, position, or time, they give as evi-
</p>
<p>dence of it, accounts of meetings detailed in the columns of a newspaper.
</p>
<p>I will consider each branch of the evidence by itself, but, before I re-
</p>
<p>fer to them, let me make this observation. As there is nothing secret,

</p>
<p>as you know all that took place, what could tempt me at this period
</p>
<p>of my life, to enter into a public conspiracy ? I have always boasted
</p>
<p>that I would keep myself and all others who acted with me, out of the
</p>
<p>meshes of the law. Twenty times have I boasted, that it is my prin-
</p>
<p>ciple and my policy to prevent an infraction of the law. If you had
</p>
<p>heard it charged, that I had entered into a private and secret con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, you might have said that I had entered into it in my old
</p>
<p>days, calculating on being saved by the secrecy and fidelity of my co-
</p>
<p>conspirators. Hut there is nothing of a private conspiracy charged
</p>
<p>against me. I therefore ask, not only those who know my sentiments
</p>
<p>better than you can, but I ask you who know me principally by the
</p>
<p>calumnies of those opposed to me  if, from your opinion of my cha-
</p>
<p>racter, you deem me such an idiot or blockhead as to enter into a
</p>
<p>conspiracy to the ruin of a cause dear to my heart, and for which I
</p>
<p>refused, my Lords, the appointment of Master of the Rolls. It was a
</p>
<p>question whether I had been offered the office of Chief Baron  but
</p>
<p>as to my having been offered the appointment of Master of the Rolls,
</p>
<p>G08
</p>
<p>there is no dispute. No, it was not to be supposed I would compro-
</p>
<p>mise the cause to which I am devoted, now, just at the closing years
</p>
<p>of my life, and on the eve of entering into eternity, where I sliall re-
</p>
<p>ceive that awful judgment which cannot now be long postponed. No,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you cannot believe that I would have the cruelty to enter
</p>
<p>into a conspiracy, the folly to enter into a conspiracy, the absurdity to
</p>
<p>enter into a conspiracy ; I ask you, as Irish gentlemen, to put your
</p>
<p>hands to your hearts, and say if yon can believe it of me. No; your
</p>
<p>verdict may imprison me, but it will not take from me the conscious-
</p>
<p>ness of my own innocence, and the conviction that there is not a man
</p>
<p>would pronounce that verdict who would not be convinced of his mis-
</p>
<p>take. Perhaps the Attorney-General wants you to believe this, that I
</p>
<p>was a conspirator without knowing it. I say without knowing it; for
</p>
<p>there it was in open day. Yes, you must, to believe anything against
</p>
<p>me, believe that I was a conspirator, ignorant of the conspiracy ; and
</p>
<p>that is the question for which you are selected to try me. In the
</p>
<p>technicalities of law, I could say even in that there could be no
</p>
<p>guilt, for there is no guilt without a guilty intention. But I scorn to
</p>
<p>make points of law upon matters so plain to common sense, so obvious,
</p>
<p>and, I trust I may say, so irresistible. There is something curious in
</p>
<p>this sweeping conspiracy of the Attorney-General.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, it has been so powerfully put to you, that I should
</p>
<p>not repeat it  that there would be an end to every great movement for
</p>
<p>the amelioration of human institutions, if you were to concede to the
</p>
<p>Attorney- General that conspiracy which he has neither stated nor
</p>
<p>proved. It is a new invention on this side of the water. Some ex-
</p>
<p>ceedingly sagacious person has dreamed of it. You are asleep. This
</p>
<p>imaginary conspiracy rests upon your imagination, but has no other
</p>
<p>solidity whatever. Would the slave trade be ever abolished if the
</p>
<p>present Attorney-General's doctrine of conspiracy had been law  if
</p>
<p>the Judges sitting in the King's Bench had given their sanction to it ?
</p>
<p>The advocates for its abolition had their aggregate meetings, and
</p>
<p>their private meetings, and they published the guilt of the West
</p>
<p>Indian planters and owners of the slaves. They made themselves

<p>bitter and unrelenting enemies; for it is extraordinary how self-
</p>
<p>interest swayed the men opposed to that glorious measure for the
</p>
<p>liberation of the negro slaves. There never was a more formidable
</p>
<p>party existed than the West Indian party. Government might have
</p>
<p>searched all the newspapers of the day, and found evidence of their
</p>
<p>guilt, of their accumulated guilt. If their acts had been a conspi-
</p>
<p>racy, why were they not indicted for a conspiracy? Why was not
</p>
<p>Wilberforce indicted for a conspiracy; that man who has written his
</p>
<p>name on the most brilliant pages of history ; that man who will be re-
</p>
<p>vered as long as there is the feeling of generosity in the world. He
</p>
<p>might have stood  as the humble individual before you stands now 
</p>
<p>accused of a conspiracy, because he put an end to the slave trade.
</p>
<p>Blessed be heaven, the measure was not suffered to be carried until I
</p>
<p>had some part in it. The venerable Clarkson is yet alive ; if there
</p>
<p>was a conspiracy, if the present doctrine of spelling out a conspiracy
</p>
<p>had been law, Clarkson is not safe in his honoured old age. Ah,
</p>
<p>609
</p>
<p>no, Gentlemen : don't venture to throw your censure not only upon
</p>
<p>this subject, but upon every subject interesting- to the amelioration of
</p>
<p>every human institution, to take away the legal mode of holding- pub-
</p>
<p>lic meetings, and of speaking the truth boldly and firmly. I, in
</p>
<p>the names of Wilberforce and Clarkson, I conjure you to dismiss
</p>
<p>from your box, with honest and zealous indignation, every attempt
</p>
<p>to shut out the freedom of discussion, and the raising- of millions,
</p>
<p>peaceably and quietly, to ameliorate the condition of human institu-
</p>
<p>tions. Well, next to abolition of slavery, what was done? I do
</p>
<p>rejoice that I was a sharer in that measure; and 1 care not whether
</p>
<p>the gloom of a prison may close upon me. My heart rewards me, for,
</p>
<p>ungifted as I am  undistinguished as I am  I have had the honour
</p>
<p>of belonging to the conspiracy by which slavery was totally abolished.
</p>
<p>I attended the meetings, and I poured cut the indignant lava of my
</p>
<p>contempt and hatred upon those who participated in the horrible prac-
</p>
<p>tice of slavery. I had my share in the measure for its abolition, and
</p>
<p>I would have suffered if this new doctrine of conspiracy had been
</p>
<p>sooner invented. The bonds of the slave would have still continued
</p>
<p>as it does in America, calling down public indignation; but no ! the
</p>
<p>heaven-descended inspiration of glorious humanity struck off the fet-
</p>
<p>ters of the negro, and will establish the freedom of Ireland. What
</p>
<p>would have become of Reform in Parliament were it not that meetings
</p>
<p>were held in Birmingham and elsewhere? Were there not hundreds of
</p>
<p>meetings held  would the Reform in Parliament have gone as far as
</p>
<p>it has done  would the additions promised in the King's Speech have
</p>
<p>gone as far as they have gone if the meetings did not assemble in se-
</p>
<p>veral thousands to petition for it? There is then Catholic Emancipation.
</p>
<p>There was a most eminent lawyer at the head of the Profession of
</p>
<p>that day ; and the present Attorney-General will not suppose that I
</p>
<p>mean any disrespect to him when I say that he was superior to him  -
</p>
<p>certainly he was his equal. He was an eminent lawyer, and he had
</p>
<p>as strong and as conscientious an antipathy to Catholic Emanci-
</p>
<p>pation as any man could have. I do not believe there was a more
</p>
<p>decided, a more honest opponent to that measure than was William

<p>Saurin. He was an eminent lawyer; and he watched and saw,
</p>
<p>as he thought, the law violated as to delegation. He was de-
</p>
<p>feated in one trial, but succeeded in another ; but did the wild-
</p>
<p>ness of his imagination call the struggle for Catholic Emanci-
</p>
<p>pation a conspiracy ? I was prosecuted for words spoken by me ;
</p>
<p>my learned friend, Mr. Sheil, was prosecuted for words spoken by
</p>
<p>him ; but that Attorney-General never dreamed of violating the
</p>
<p>Constitution, by turning the alleged offence into a conspiracy. Yet
</p>
<p>were not the ingredients used in agitating for Catholic Emancipation
</p>
<p>the same as that for Repeal? Had we not our county meetings,
</p>
<p>our provincial meetings, and a simultaneous meeting? On the
</p>
<p>13th of January, 1829, did not all the Catholic parishes in Ireland
</p>
<p>meet one day ? Why, indeed, that could have been wrested into
</p>
<p>evidence of a conspiracy, if anything could  for upon one day
</p>
<p>every parish in Ireland met, and upon one day they all proclaimed
</p>
<p>their determination to persevere in their exertions until they ob-
</p>
<p>4i
</p>
<p>610
</p>
<p>tained religious equality. No man dreamed of turning that into a conspi-
</p>
<p>racy. It was reserved For this time, this day, for the glory of this At-
</p>
<p>torney-General, to introduce this doctrine  to discover what none
</p>
<p>of his predecessors could possibly find out. At the present moment
</p>
<p>there is a very serious question in agitation in England. There is
</p>
<p>the Anti-Corn Law League ; they say, and I say, that their object is
</p>
<p>to produce cheap bread for the poor, and to increase the number of
</p>
<p>persons employed. But I am not going into that question, we have
</p>
<p>enough of our own, we know that they and the Anti-Slavery Society
</p>
<p>collected money from abroad, as well as at home ; that they have
</p>
<p>used the boldest language, language for which he said that the
</p>
<p>Rev. Mr. Fisher accused them of promoting assassination and incen-
</p>
<p>diarism. Gentlemen, we are free from even the accusation of this.
</p>
<p>But what is this precedent to be given for ? Is it to be sent over to
</p>
<p>England, that there is the authority of this Court, or any part of the
</p>
<p>Court, to put down the glorious struggle there, which would give men
</p>
<p>markets, and give corn in exchange for manufactures, and give cheap
</p>
<p>bread to the poor ? Is that to be turned into a conspiracy? Ah, no.
</p>
<p>The Englishmen were safe in the glorious integrity of the jury-box.
</p>
<p>Yes, they are safe, for there would not be a single juror sworn upon
</p>
<p>any such trial as this, who had been educated in strong opposite opi-
</p>
<p>nions to the accused. In England, whoever differs with violence, and
</p>
<p>upon principle, with the traversers, would not be sworn upon the jury.
</p>
<p>No, they are safe. The angel's wing, mounting from the pure jury-
</p>
<p>box, protects them from it. I would be mocking you in telling you
</p>
<p>that the English would be in danger; do you protect us as an English
</p>
<p>jury would protect them, and I will require no more, I will be satisfied
</p>
<p>with no less. In this mode will redressfor the English people be worked
</p>
<p>out, despite of those who are now uneasy in the enjoyment of their
</p>
<p>monopolies under the accumulated weight of public opinion. A cele-
</p>
<p>brated French author says, and I do not quote him in approval of the
</p>
<p>conduct of the French, for no man abhors more sincerely, or more
</p>
<p>intensely than I do their infidel republicanism. One of their great
</p>
<p>men has said : " You cannot make a revolution with rose water."

<p>He would effect it by blood, but I will effect by a little Irish spirit,
</p>
<p>enlivened by a little of Poteen, or at least of the Queen's whiskey.
</p>
<p>Now let us come to the machinery of the evidence brought for-
</p>
<p>ward to sustain this case : I told you there were two classes of evi-
</p>
<p>dence, if I am not wrong in using the word brought forward by the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General, monster meetings and newspaper publications. I
</p>
<p>will take each separately. I am not here to deny that those meetings
</p>
<p>took place ; on the contrary, I admit that they did, and that they
</p>
<p>were monster assemblages, consisting of tens and hundreds of thou-
</p>
<p>sands. It has been somewhere said that the magnitude of a meeting
</p>
<p>alone would make it illegal ; but I give so little of weight to such an
</p>
<p>assertion, that, not thinking it worthy of refutation, I shall not stop
</p>
<p>to discuss it. But I at once admit that those meetings took place,
</p>
<p>and I will ask you, Gentlemen of the Jury, was the life of any man,
</p>
<p>woman, or child, nay, of any animal, lost at then) ? You unani-
</p>
<p>mously answer that there was not. Was any one struck or injured in
</p>
<p>the slightest degree at those meetings ? You unanimously answer
</p>
<p>Gil
</p>
<p>no. Was any female, young or old, exposed at them to any outrage
</p>
<p>or indelicacy of conduct? You answer not one. Was there one
</p>
<p>shilling's worth of property belonging to any individual destroyed or
</p>
<p>injured? You also answer unanimously in the negative. Oh yes,
</p>
<p>I forgot, I have perhaps exaggerated here ; for a policeman, in co-
</p>
<p>loured clothes, was put on the table, who swore that at Tara the
</p>
<p>crowd went near committing the violence of overturning an old wo-
</p>
<p>man's gingerbread stand. Now, Gentlemen, I put it to you, does
</p>
<p>not that speak a foregone conclusion ? If any other violence, if this
</p>
<p>occurrence could be called so, were committed, would not the Crown
</p>
<p>be ready with the evidence to prove it ? But the whole amount of
</p>
<p>injury done was, that a gingerbread stand was nearly upset, and even
</p>
<p>of that accident the poor woman who owned it did not complain.
</p>
<p>Y'es, it is ridiculous, but it is the prosecution which is so. Well, then,
</p>
<p>it is conceded that there was no violation of the peace, that there
</p>
<p>was no injury to property; that there was no violation of morals
</p>
<p>or good manners ; that not even an accident or casualty of the
</p>
<p>most insignificant nature occurred at any of those meetings. Now,
</p>
<p>is it not a strange, an extraordinary thing to tell me, that I
</p>
<p>infuriated the people to such an extent by those assemblages,
</p>
<p>that they were on the very verge of rebellion  while their con-
</p>
<p>duct is so exemplary, and their courtesy to each other such, that
</p>
<p>not even an accident occurred on any of those occasions? At these
</p>
<p>meetings might be seen the grave matron, with her grown-up daugh-
</p>
<p>ters  ay, and the young mother, with her infant in her arms, passed
</p>
<p>through the midst of the immense crowds unharmed, almost un-
</p>
<p>touched. Oh ! it would have delighted you to see the men make a
</p>
<p>living wall of protection for the females as they passed. Their bro-
</p>
<p>thers and their fathers were there too, and, knowing the spirit of the
</p>
<p>meetings, they confided them to the crowd without apprehension.
</p>
<p>And so help me heaven  no, I withdraw that solemn expression 
</p>
<p>there could not be more emphatic evidence of the total absence of
</p>
<p>outrage, violence, or anything tending to it, than the electricity of
</p>
<p>affectionate feeling and sentiment which pervaded those monster

<p>assemblages. There is not, Gentlemen, a country in the world,
</p>
<p>except our own, where such meetings could have taken place with
</p>
<p>the same results ; and there is not in the world a people who
</p>
<p>could have conducted themselves in such an exemplary manner,
</p>
<p>except the persecuted and calumniated people of Ireland  that
</p>
<p>" filthy and felonious multitude," as the Times calls them ; yet
</p>
<p>there are no people on the face of the earth who could afford
</p>
<p>such a specimen of moral diginity and elevation. But they have
</p>
<p>been educated in this quiet and courteous demeanor  their peaceable
</p>
<p>struggle for forty years, for Emancipation and for Repeal, has educa-
</p>
<p>ted them in the doctrine and practice of sublime and pacific determi-
</p>
<p>nation ; and, thank heaven, that pacific determination is not ruffled by
</p>
<p>anything occurring in this Court. No, Gentlemen of the Jury, they
</p>
<p>will abide your verdict patiently. They may disapprove of it as men
</p>
<p>usually do of a verdict adverse to their feelings and wishes ; but there
</p>
<p>will be no violation of the law, whatever your verdict may be, and
</p>
<p>whatever may be the fate of the humble individual who addresses you^
</p>
<p>012
</p>
<p>and who boasts that he is the educator of the Irish people in the
</p>
<p>lesson of legal, peaceable, and continuous political exertion.
</p>
<p>But it is said, Gentlemen of the Jury, that large meetings neces-
</p>
<p>sarily lead to intimidation. Do they? Gentlemen, ask yourselves that
</p>
<p>question. Were not all the Magistrates of the various districts in
</p>
<p>which those meetings occurred, witnesses of them, and most of those
</p>
<p>who remain in the commission of the peace, and unfavourable to
</p>
<p>Repeal, and why were they not produced ? Why were not all the
</p>
<p>clergymen of the Established Church  why were not all the most
</p>
<p>timid persons, whether in pantaloons or petticoats, produced to bear
</p>
<p>testimony to this intimidation? Why, because they could not con-
</p>
<p>scientiously swear that there was any thing approaching to intimi-
</p>
<p>dation. Thus, with the most ample opportunities of adducing the
</p>
<p>most abundant proofs of intimidation, if it existed, there was an utter
</p>
<p>absence of evidence, and did not that absence of evidence speak
</p>
<p>trumpet-tongued ? I tell the Attorney-General, that, having at his
</p>
<p>command witnesses of the most unimpeachable character, if those
</p>
<p>meetings were productive of any dread to any portion of the public,
</p>
<p>he utterly neglected his duty in not producing them, if they could
</p>
<p>have deposed to such a statement. But not a particle of such evi-
</p>
<p>dence had been produced, for the sufficient reason that it did not
</p>
<p>exist. The police, to a man, deposed to the perfect tranquillity
</p>
<p>which existed. The police might have been asked did not any one 
</p>
<p>did not the most timid complain, but no such interrogatory was put,
</p>
<p>for they had already said, everything was perfectly quiet. But there
</p>
<p>is another feature in those meetings to which I shall call your
</p>
<p>attention. At not one of those meetings was there any man-
</p>
<p>date or authority disobeyed  no magisterial warrant was, in the
</p>
<p>slightest degree, resisted  no message from any official personage or
</p>
<p>quarter treated with disregard  no Police Inspector resisted or diso-
</p>
<p>beyed  no announcement of their legal authority treated with
</p>
<p>contempt. If those meetings were dangerous to the public peace,
</p>
<p>why not proclaim them ? If we were seditious, why not warn us ?
</p>
<p>And, when they were at length proclaimed, after having been per-

</p>
<p>mitted for months to proceed without a hint of illegality, was not
</p>
<p>the proclamation at once obeyed ? Yet, we are branded as conspi-
</p>
<p>rators ; yes, conspirators obeying the law and enforcing it. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men of the Jury, we have witnessed many misfortunes in our country ;
</p>
<p>we have many causes of bitter and relentless animosity amongst
</p>
<p>us. Oh, Gentlemen, your verdict, I feel the fullest confidence, will
</p>
<p>not be an addition to those misfortunes and to that animosity, but
</p>
<p>on the contrary, be the means of calming the troubled waters, and
</p>
<p>smoothing the asperity which has caused so much unhappiness. No,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, no  these meetings were not illegal ; they were peaceable
</p>
<p>meetings, suited to the purposes for which they were convened. If
</p>
<p>it had been at one, or two, or three, or ten of those meetings this
</p>
<p>peaceable conduct was observed  if it had been only at a few of
</p>
<p>them this conduct distinguished the behaviour of the people  it
</p>
<p>might be said to be casual. But no, it was the same at them all ;
</p>
<p>they were peaceable by design. We have received the same answer
</p>
<p> peace  in reference to every one of them. The Government
</p>
<p>613
</p>
<p>knew of those meetings ; everybody knew of them ; and why were
</p>
<p>they not impeded if they were illegal? J am not one of those who
</p>
<p>say that the Attorney-General endeavoured to entrap persons into
</p>
<p>criminality. I say no such thing. I do him more justice. I say
</p>
<p>that he did not prosecute or interfere, because there was no ground
</p>
<p>for prosecuting, because there was no ground for interference. 1 do
</p>
<p>not utter one word of reproach or calumny against him. I am told,
</p>
<p>my Lord, that a few minutes ago I used the equivocal word design,
</p>
<p>in reference to the peaceableness of those meetings, but I only used
</p>
<p>it in its true meaning. The design to be peaceable existed before
</p>
<p>one of those meetings took place. It exists now, and it will continue
</p>
<p>to exist on the part of the people. When I spoke of design I spoke
</p>
<p>of the education of the Irish people, that education which taught them
</p>
<p>that the only way to obtain valuable amelioration was by acting peace-
</p>
<p>ably, and in strict conformity with the law.
</p>
<p>I have now done with those meetings, and I ask you, Gentlemen
</p>
<p>of the Jury, what evidence are they of the existence of a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy ? I leave that matter to your consciences, to your integrity,
</p>
<p>as my countrymen. What care I about your political opinions?
</p>
<p>what care I about your political sentiments ? you all know that
</p>
<p>you must answer before your Maker for your verdict. I leave
</p>
<p>the responsibility to you. Well, as I said before, I will leave those
</p>
<p>meetings, and come to the next evidence as to this conspiracy, which
</p>
<p>is, the newspapers. Do not imagine I am going to detain you canvass-
</p>
<p>ing the sentences in them ; that has been very ably done already. I
</p>
<p>will only take up the general nature of the evidence in this respect, and
</p>
<p>I submit to you, Gentlemen, that with the exception of the speeches
</p>
<p>proved to have been delivered by me, those newspapers are no evi-
</p>
<p>dence against me, and see what a circle is pointed out for you to tra-
</p>
<p>vel over, so far as ihey are concerned. Are you to go round and
</p>
<p>spell out conspiracy ? for they are not evidence unless there be con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. I leave that to the Court as a matter of law. But suppose
</p>
<p>they go to you as evidence at all, what is their substantial weight
</p>
<p>against me ? There is not the least proof that I ever saw any of

</p>
<p>those newspapers, there is not the least proof of any connexion be-
</p>
<p>tween me and any of those newspapers. It will be seen by their
</p>
<p>dates that at the time the very harshest paragraphs appeared in them
</p>
<p>I was not even in town. Cut it is proved that at the Association I
</p>
<p>distinctly disavowed that any newspaper was the organ of our body.
</p>
<p>It is said that we circulated those newspapers, but the effect of that
</p>
<p>evidence amounts to this only, that those who subscribed a certain
</p>
<p>sum of money allocated a part of that money to the choice of a news-
</p>
<p>paper, and they selected what newspaper they pleased. The news-
</p>
<p>paper sent to them was their own choice, and you will recollect, Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, it was we proclaimed that not one of them was the organ
</p>
<p>of the Association. It is also said that they contained libel ; if they
</p>
<p>did, why were not the proprietors of them punished ? You will re-
</p>
<p>collect, my Lords, when we sent those newspapers according to the
</p>
<p>directions given to us by the parties, those newspapers were subject
</p>
<p>to the libel law ; if there was libel in them it was the province of the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General to prosecute the oublishers ; but it is not proved that
</p>
<p>G14
</p>
<p>we circulated that which was libellous. The fact is, the Attorney"
</p>
<p>General would have prosecuted in these cases, if he thought it worth
</p>
<p>his while, and he did not. What, after all, have those newspapers
</p>
<p>done ? Of what have they been guilty ? Of publishing a parcel of
</p>
<p>speeches, which I question if any one of them would be remembered
</p>
<p>if it were not for this trial. It is giving fictitious and absurd impor-
</p>
<p>tance to these newspapers. But they are charged with exciting the
</p>
<p>people to riot, violence, and tumult. Did they ever produce it ?
</p>
<p>Was it proved that it flowed from any one of them ? No ; they stand
</p>
<p>in that respect acquitted. They produced no deleterious effect
</p>
<p>whatsoever. There are, Gentlemen, belonging to this entire case,
</p>
<p>and especially on the topic on which I have just addressed you, other
</p>
<p>things to be observed. You have to decide whether that political
</p>
<p>problem I have sought to solve  whether that political theory I have
</p>
<p>endeavoured to realize  in fact, the avowed and boasted one of my
</p>
<p>political life, is of a nature to be considered fairly and honestly ille-
</p>
<p>gal ? You will take my public actions into your consideration, and
</p>
<p>form your judgment upon them ; and I ask you then to say, whether
</p>
<p>peace and obedience to the law have not been the great and leading
</p>
<p>principles of my life. The Attorney-General himself has admitted
</p>
<p>the peaceable nature of my intentions ; and nothing could be more
</p>
<p>fair than the reading of those portions of the newspapers which
</p>
<p>showed this. My mottoes of peace were proved over and over again
</p>
<p>in this Court. One, you will recollect, is : Whoever commits a
</p>
<p>crime gives strength to the enemy. That motto is on the walls of
</p>
<p>the building in which we meet; it is inscribed on our banners, and it
</p>
<p>is the constant subject of our conversation. Peace in every shape
</p>
<p>and form has been the principle on which we acted. Another of our
</p>
<p>mottoes, and one which I have repeated over and over again, is :
</p>
<p>That no political advantage whatever is worth one drop of human'
</p>
<p>blood. I disclaim physical force at all times, and in every contin-
</p>
<p>gency, except in the actual brutal attack of civil war. I proclaimed
</p>
<p>my abhorrence of the shedding of one drop of blood in looking for
</p>
<p>Catholic Emancipation. I succeeded in carrying it with the might

<p>and power of that principle. Look to the agitation of that measure ;
</p>
<p>look to the struggles to attain it, and you will find that not one single
</p>
<p>drop of blood was shed. Look to our struggles for Repeal hitherto.
</p>
<p>It has been, and will always be our boast, that not one single drop of
</p>
<p>blood was shed. Is it right to prosecute the man who has laid that
</p>
<p>down as the basis of his political conduct? Is it right to call my
</p>
<p>acts a conspiracy, and leave open the man who would look for mea-
</p>
<p>sures by violence and take them by force ? I belong to a Christian
</p>
<p>persuasion, the principle of which is, that no quantity of advantage,
</p>
<p>no quantity of profit to Church or State, not even Heaven itself, was
</p>
<p>permitted to be attained at the expense of any one crime ; and that
</p>
<p>no sin could be justified or palliated by any amount of advantage,
</p>
<p>however considerable. If there were in that box any co-believer
</p>
<p>with me, I need not repeat that principle, because he would be able
</p>
<p>to inform you of the doctrines which he and I profess. The entire
</p>
<p>tenor of my life proves the sincerity with which I have made the
</p>
<p>615
</p>
<p>announcement of my principle. I have announced it over and over
</p>
<p>again ; and so often that there is no circumstance of my life could
</p>
<p>make you doubt, for a moment, the sincerity of my professions.
</p>
<p>My Lords, it has been proved sufficiently in the newspapers ; and,
</p>
<p>if not, it is perfectly well known that no man ever possessed so much
</p>
<p>of public confidence as 1 do. I will say " possessed it." No man has
</p>
<p>so unremittingly as I have obtained the confidence of the Catholic
</p>
<p>laity of every class, not only those who are our party, and may look
</p>
<p>to a change for amelioration, but the Catholics of the middle classes,
</p>
<p>the higher orders, the Catholic clergy, and the Catholic episcopacy.
</p>
<p>I have obtained their confidence by the assertion of the principles
</p>
<p>which I have stated ; by the sincerity with which I have entertained
</p>
<p>and announced them. How long could I have possessed that confi-
</p>
<p>dence, how long could I possess it, if I were a base deceiver, if I did
</p>
<p>not show by years and years of public activity, the energy as well as
</p>
<p>the continuance of my political career, and the purity of my senti-
</p>
<p>ments. I stand before you surrounded by my fellow-countrymen. I
</p>
<p>have earned that confidence which no man could earn who wished to
</p>
<p>perpetrate crime ; which no man could preserve for nearly forty years
</p>
<p>unbroken, unmitigated, complete, and entire. Charge not your fel-
</p>
<p>low-countrymen, with whom you differ in opinion, with being deceiv-
</p>
<p>ers; they cannot be so, they are not so; do not tell them that they
</p>
<p>are countenancing hypocrisy and giving credence to pretence, pro-
</p>
<p>tection to imposition. It is not so; you cannot believe it; the public
</p>
<p>would not believe it ; England, prejudiced as she is against us, would
</p>
<p>not believe it; Europe would start at it. I, a Catholic, am pleading
</p>
<p>before a Protestant jury, in the presence, I may say, of the monarchs
</p>
<p>and people of the earth ; and I implore of you to consider whether you
</p>
<p>will tarnish all your fellow-countrymen, including many Protestants of
</p>
<p>the first respectability, by any verdict which would seem to doubt for a
</p>
<p>moment the perfect sincerity of the doctrine of my whole life, the pride
</p>
<p>and boast of my existence, the comfort and consolation of my declining
</p>
<p>years, and my hope for a higher and more awful tribunal. No, Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, I do not do you justice in urging this so strongly upon you ;

</p>
<p>you are incapable of taking such a view of the case. You may observe,
</p>
<p>and it is almost the only remaining observation I shall urge upon this
</p>
<p>point, that an imputation was never cast upon my sincerity. I doubt
</p>
<p>whether it was ever impugned ; I never heard it impugned, and I am
</p>
<p>quite sure it ought not to be so. It is not possible for you to believe
</p>
<p>that I would desert the principles of which I boast, or forsake those
</p>
<p>doctrines which have been the life-blood of my political existence,
</p>
<p>and enter into a foul conspiracy. I have been more successful by the
</p>
<p>course which I adopted than I would have been had I taken another.
</p>
<p>I have been successful, because I acted upon the principle of justice,
</p>
<p>charity, obedience to the law, and the total abhorrence of force and
</p>
<p>violence. You, therefore, cannot believe that I would desert every
</p>
<p>principle of my life, and enter into a conspiracy utterly inconsistent
</p>
<p>with everything that has yet occurred in my public conduct.
</p>
<p>But it is not upon these grounds alone that I rely. There have
</p>
<p>been other incidents in my political career, which will enable you to
</p>
<p>GIG
</p>
<p>form a better estimate of my intentions and sentiments. There is
</p>
<p>not one of you, Gentlemen of the Jury, who does not, I presume,
</p>
<p>remember the fearful system of combination which prevailed eight
</p>
<p>years ago in Dublin. You know that, before that, time, lives were
</p>
<p>sacrificed in the public streets, and violence had been offered, day
</p>
<p>after day, to persons. You know also that if death did not ensue,
</p>
<p>in some recent instances, it was rather an accidental circumstance
</p>
<p>than resulting from any forbearance upon the part of the combina-
</p>
<p>tors. You must remember it. The public authorities were insuf-
</p>
<p>ficient to cope with the offenders. It is said that I am ready to sacra-
</p>
<p>fice principle to popularity ; who dares to say it ? Could I not have
</p>
<p>easily made myself popular with these combinators? I opposed them
</p>
<p>publicly  I stood alone  I opposed them at the peril of my life, and
</p>
<p>I owe the protection of my life, at the meeting held in the Royal
</p>
<p>Exchange, at which many operatives differing with me in religion
</p>
<p>and politics attended, to the protection of the police. I did not
</p>
<p>shrink from it ; what was the consequence ? I persuaded those who
</p>
<p>were at first so furious against me, of the folly and rashness of their
</p>
<p>conduct, and from that day to this, I believe there has not been a
</p>
<p>single act of violence committed by a combinator ; and, at the risk
</p>
<p>of my popularity  at the risk of my life  is it credible to believe
</p>
<p>that I would have taken that step, if I were not actuated by motives
</p>
<p>becoming a Christian and a citizen ? You will find, too, my perpetual
</p>
<p>opposition to Ribbonism. Has not my condemnation of Ribbonism
</p>
<p>been read over and over again ? Have not my warnings to the peo-
</p>
<p>ple  my denunciations to the police, publicly calling upon them to
</p>
<p>stop the progress of the evil system  been published to the world ?
</p>
<p>If I were in a conspiracy, would I not have been glad to have
</p>
<p>been assisted by other conspirators ? if my object and my end were
</p>
<p>iniquitous, would I not have had an advantage in that iniquity, by
</p>
<p>rousing the Ribbonmen upon my behalf in the various parts of
</p>
<p>Ireland ? I had great influence, and could have used it in this
</p>
<p>particular. You have the fact that I did not do so before you ;
</p>
<p>it has been read to you over and over again ; my discounte-

</p>
<p>nancing the Ribbon societies is notorious ; nay more, my re-
</p>
<p>resistance to all secret societies  my constant denunciations of
</p>
<p>them, are before the world. Take these things into your considera-
</p>
<p>tion, and say, if you believe in your consciences, that the man is a base
</p>
<p>hypocrite, who, without any worldly motive whatever, but adherence
</p>
<p>to principle, opposed and flung away all the instruments that could tar-
</p>
<p>nish his cause, however useful they might be. There is another point,
</p>
<p>if you remarked my public life, which must have struck you, perhaps I
</p>
<p>differ from you, but you must have observed that Iopposed it at the risk
</p>
<p>of my life and the loss of my popularity  I mean the present system of
</p>
<p>poor law. With the influence I possess, could I not have raised the
</p>
<p>poverty of Ireland against its property if I chose, and insisted that all
</p>
<p>those who were rich should feed all those who were poor ? No, I
</p>
<p>saw the danger which the measure threatened to property, and at the
</p>
<p>risk of popularity  taunted b} r many and many a sincere friend  bit-
</p>
<p>terly sneered at by many men who had joined me  I consulted my
</p>
<p>617
</p>
<p>conscience  I cousulted tlie real nature of a provision that makes
</p>
<p>more destitute than it relieves, and is at an expense so enormously
</p>
<p>great that the very expenditure itself would give poor law relief. I
</p>
<p>knew it was not fit for Ireland in its present state ; but I am hound to
</p>
<p>say that, since it passed into a law, I have not given it any opposition. I
</p>
<p>look back to the time when I was unpopular with those whose favour I
</p>
<p>was most anxious to conciliate, and in whose estimation I was most
</p>
<p>desirous of standing high. To this part of my life do I appeal in an-
</p>
<p>swer to this foul charge which has been brought against me. You
</p>
<p>recollect  for it was given in evidence  the manner in which I an-
</p>
<p>swered young Mr. Tyler. You remember, too, the manner of that
</p>
<p>answer, and you saw the nature of it, from what was given in evi-
</p>
<p>dence by Mr. Bond Hughes. And here, my Lords, let me say a
</p>
<p>word with respect to that gentleman. I was among the number of
</p>
<p>those who took steps against Mr. Hughes, convinced, as we then
</p>
<p>were, that he had sworn falsely  (I am delighted I mentioned his
</p>
<p>name, for it gives me this opportunity of doing him justice.) I now
</p>
<p>openly state, that I never saw a witness give evidence in a more
</p>
<p>manly, straightforward manner ; and I am thoroughly convinced that
</p>
<p>it was a mere mistake which he committed, and into which any ho-
</p>
<p>nest man might have fallen. This declaration is not part of the case,
</p>
<p>but I trust your Lordships will not think it quite irrelevant or unne-
</p>
<p>cessary. Again, with regard to American assistance, what was my
</p>
<p>conduct? I informed the Americans that the Irish people would
</p>
<p>not take any support from them, which could in the slightest degree
</p>
<p>prove disparaging to their allegiance to the Sovereign of these realms :
</p>
<p>this will be still more strongly impressed upon your minds, when
</p>
<p>you recollect my conduct on the slave question, and when you
</p>
<p>heard my indignant denunciations of slavery. The advocates of that
</p>
<p>horrid traffic were on the alert ; the Southern States were collecting
</p>
<p>subscriptions, and large sums of money had been accumulated in
</p>
<p>Charleston, Carolina, to assist the Repealers. Did I shrink from doing
</p>
<p>my duty on the slave question then ? Did I not denounce as enemies to
</p>
<p>God and man, as culprits and criminals, the infamous upholders of that

<p>trade ? Did I not compare them to pickpockets and felons, and express
</p>
<p>in the most forcible language, my denunciation and abhorrence of those
</p>
<p>who carried on an execrable traffic in human beings ? Oh, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>if I were indeed a hypocrite, would I not have given them a few smooth
</p>
<p>words or glossed over them in the language of conciliation ? but my
</p>
<p>heart is, and ever has been, actuated by love of liberty and humanity,
</p>
<p>and they do not speak the truth who say that I am, or ever have
</p>
<p>been, a hypocrite. You have had it in the newspapers, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>that we were offered assistance from France. Yot have heard that
</p>
<p>the democratic party in France, headed by Monsieur Ledru Rollin,
</p>
<p>proferred us their sympathy and support. That party hates the Eng-
</p>
<p>lish nation most of all ; the ferocious hatred of England, which, per-
</p>
<p>haps not without reason, when they remember the blow their va-
</p>
<p>nity got at Waterloo. Did I ask the support of his party ; did I
</p>
<p>mitigate or frame my answer in such a way as could be construed into
</p>
<p>encouragement ? No ! I took the firm tone of allegiance and loy-
</p>
<p>4K
</p>
<p>G18
</p>
<p>alty. I rejected his support,  indignantly rejected it. I cautioned
</p>
<p>him strongly against coming over to this country ; I told him we
</p>
<p>would do nothing inconsistent with our loyalty. Is this the way to
</p>
<p>prove my hypocrisy ? Would I have so acted had I been indeed a
</p>
<p>hypocrite ? Even the present Monarch of France I have not at-
</p>
<p>tempted to win over. I have refused the slightest assistance from
</p>
<p>him ; nay, more, have hurled defiance at him. The Attorney-Ge-
</p>
<p>neral, with great ingenuity, introduces a report of a secret com-
</p>
<p>mittee of the Irish House of Commons, in the year 1797, with re-
</p>
<p>spect to the United Irishmen, into the case before you, to show that
</p>
<p>we were acting on their plan. Was there the slightest comparison
</p>
<p>between them and the Repealers? Assuredly not. The United
</p>
<p>Irishmen were looking to assistance from France  had emissaries
</p>
<p>there ; whilst, perhaps, French emissaries were travelling through this
</p>
<p>country. Acting on their plan  looking for French aid  looking for
</p>
<p>armed force and a violent revolution ? Oh ! Gentlemen, it was di-
</p>
<p>rectly the reverse of ours. It may be said that I speculated upon
</p>
<p>the restoration of the elder branch of the Bourbons to the throne, and
</p>
<p>that I expected Henry the Fifth to be King; butreally, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>I should be very sorry indeed to wait for the Repeal of the Union
</p>
<p>till that event takes place. I do not conceal my opinion that Europe
</p>
<p>will not be perfectly safe till that branch of the family be restored to
</p>
<p>the throne. They have a better title than any other monarch. No !
</p>
<p>a better title than that of our gracious Sovereign does not exist; but
</p>
<p>they have abetter title than the present King of France. From that
</p>
<p>King I have refused the slightest assistance. Nay, more. I hurled
</p>
<p>my indignation against the man who had delivered over the children
</p>
<p>of France to be instructed by infidel Professors. You have now
</p>
<p>seen my antagonism to the French Government ; it is capable of
</p>
<p>proof. You have seen my conduct with respect to the Chartists.
</p>
<p>You remember they were up in arms ; up in insurrection through-
</p>
<p>out England ; crowding in thousands and tens of thousands through
</p>
<p>all her manufacturing towns ; their doctrines were spreading ;
</p>
<p>their disciples increasing, for there was something fascinating for

</p>
<p>the poorer classes in the principles of the Charter. It proposed,
</p>
<p>in truth and substance, a violation of all property ; its followers were
</p>
<p>numerous; they offered me aid. If I were a hypocrite, should I have
</p>
<p>refused it ? I denounced them; I denounced their doctrines ; I drove
</p>
<p>them from Ireland ; I prevented the Irish in Manchester from join-
</p>
<p>ing them. It has been read to you that the moment we discovered
</p>
<p>that a Chartist had joined the Association, his money was returned to
</p>
<p>him, and his name struck off the list of members. If my object were
</p>
<p>insurrection, think you I would have acted so ? Gentlemen, do place
</p>
<p>yourselves for one moment in my situation. Good heaven! if you
</p>
<p>wished for an armed outbreak and insurrection, would you not wish
</p>
<p>for strength  would you not conciliate those who were the advocates
</p>
<p>of force ? Did I do so with the Chartists? Did I not meet them,
</p>
<p>and hunt them out of Dublin  of Ireland, although there were none
</p>
<p>of the dangers in their doctrines, none of the penalties attached to
</p>
<p>Ribbonism ? My Lords, I do firmly declare that if I had not opposed
</p>
<p>Chartism, it would have passed over, and spread from one end of Ire-
</p>
<p>619
</p>
<p>land to the other. Thank heaven that I did resist it ; and, whatever
</p>
<p>becomes of this trial, I will ever rejoice that I kept Ireland free from
</p>
<p>their pollution.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, there is another matter to which I would wish to call
</p>
<p>your attention  my constant avowed allegiance to the Sovereign ;
</p>
<p>that you will find in all the newspapers. Her name is never mentioned
</p>
<p>but with respect; and when I had to make a speech in some degree
</p>
<p>derogatory to the respect due to a royal lady, you find me making a
</p>
<p>distinction between her and her Ministers. 1 made that clear distinc-
</p>
<p>tion, that constitutional distinction, and I do complain somewhat of
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General's conduct here. He had no right to say that
</p>
<p>there was a particle of disloyalty in those remarks. If I did not make
</p>
<p>any distinction at all, it would have been quite open for me to
</p>
<p>comment on that speech ; but what becomes of the assertion that I
</p>
<p>have been guilty ofdisloyalty in the remarks I made, when I did draw
</p>
<p>a marked distinction so often that the repetition was almost nauseat-
</p>
<p>ing. Thank heaven ! there is nothing to attaint my loyalty, nor
</p>
<p>has the attempt ever been made. That I have proclaimed in language
</p>
<p>which admits of no dispute. I have come to that time of life
</p>
<p>at which it could do me no good, or procure anything for me,
</p>
<p>to boast of my loyalty ; but there is not an expectant in this
</p>
<p>court who could have morefrequently or strongly expressed it. I do
</p>
<p>complain that the Attorney-General behaved unfairly in the remarks
</p>
<p>he made on this subject. He read the Queen's speech, and also, on
</p>
<p>the authority of a newspaper, stated that I had used the expression
</p>
<p>"Judy took an unfair advantage of us," in speaking of Her Majesty.
</p>
<p>Now, I said it was the Minister's speech, and it was of the ministerial
</p>
<p>scolding I spoke when I used that expression; to that I referred, and
</p>
<p>nothing else ; and I did say, that in not allowing us to reply, " Judy
</p>
<p>was unfair  she did not let us make answer," speaking of the Minis-
</p>
<p>ters and of their speech. I have to complain here that I have been
</p>
<p>badly treated. I mean the learned gentleman no discourtesy, I do not
</p>
<p>wish to say anything harsh; but 1 tell him it is utterly false that I
</p>
<p>ever used such a word with reference to Her Majesty. I disclaim,

</p>
<p>abhor, hate, and despise the man who could use such language with
</p>
<p>reference to Her Majesty. I have never been accused of discourtesy
</p>
<p>towards the gentler sex, who form so much of our happiness ; and,
</p>
<p>least of all, could I apply such terms to one who is at once our be-
</p>
<p>loved Sovereign, and of a sex which forms our chief comfort and con-
</p>
<p>solation. I have detained you longer than I thought respecting my
</p>
<p>public conduct. To you I leave it ; but having in reserve the conso-
</p>
<p>lation of knowing that, though my means may be feeble, my talents
</p>
<p>confessedly small, and my energies declining, my ardent, my enthu-
</p>
<p>siastic, and burning love of Ireland and of liberty, is unquenchable ;
</p>
<p>it is a portion of my very vitality, and forms the entire object of my
</p>
<p>political and personal existence.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen,these public meetings took place; they must havehad an
</p>
<p>object, and so they had ; their object was a Repeal of the Union. That
</p>
<p>it was a bad or injurious object, I utterly deny; it was a most useful object,
</p>
<p>and I shall prove to you that there is not a man in this Court, the
</p>
<p>neutrality of the Bench alone excepted, that ought not to become a
</p>
<p>620
</p>
<p>Repealer. Before I sit down I hope to make Repealers of some of
</p>
<p>you. I am quite sure of this, that it is your duty, and if it is your
</p>
<p>duty, will it not be your pleasure, to join me. I shall now tell vou
</p>
<p>what I mean to do. I mean first to demonstrate that the English
</p>
<p>Parliament has, from the remotest period at which she possessed the
</p>
<p>power, governed Ireland with a narrow, jealous, restrictive, and op-
</p>
<p>pressive policy. By way of parenthesis, I would just beg of you to
</p>
<p>recollect the history of the woollen manufactures of Ireland, in the
</p>
<p>reign of a monarch whom you are not disposed to condemn. I shall
</p>
<p>next demonstrate in succession that the transactions of 1782 were in-
</p>
<p>tended to be a final adjustment, and that it was then intended and
</p>
<p>agreed that the Irish Parliament should be established for ever; that
</p>
<p>the greatest prosperity followed from the protective influence of that
</p>
<p>Parliament, after having achieved its independence, and that the
</p>
<p>Union was forced upon the Irish people against their consent by the
</p>
<p>most criminal means. I shall nest show you in detail the many evils
</p>
<p>that resulted from the Union, and the gross injustice of the enact-
</p>
<p>ment of that Statute. I shall show you the increasing distress and
</p>
<p>destitution which have arisen from that Statute, and that there is no
</p>
<p>probability, I think no possible means, of restoring prosperity to this
</p>
<p>country, or of avoiding ultimate separation from England, save by the
</p>
<p>restoration of her Parliament. The ill treatment of Ireland by Eng-
</p>
<p>land is so confessedly true as matter of history, that I scarcely
</p>
<p>think it worth while detaining you upon that part of my subject;
</p>
<p>yet, having been brought here by the Attorney-General, by rea-
</p>
<p>son of my agitating for Repeal, I must defend myself, and my
</p>
<p>defence is, that, instead of looking for anything evil, destruc-
</p>
<p>tive, or injurious, I am, and have been performing the sacred
</p>
<p>duty of endeavouring to procure the greatest possible blessing to Ire-
</p>
<p>land  the protection of her own Parliament. I am too much devoted
</p>
<p>to the people of Ireland not to be devoted to them at all risks. I
</p>
<p>have represented the county of Clare with 250,000 inhabitants,
</p>
<p>Waterford with 300,000, Kerry with 260,000, Meath with 300,000,
</p>

<p>I have twice represented the city of Dublin, and once that of Kilkenny.
</p>
<p>Duties therefore fell upon me that belong to few. My gratitude to those
</p>
<p>people is boundless. I am their hired servant. Yes, I am their paid ser-
</p>
<p>vant. It may derogate from the chivalry of my situation ; but I avow
</p>
<p>it, and am ready to earn my salary.
</p>
<p>I shall begin by showing you the scheme of misgovernment
</p>
<p>that was pursued by England towards this country, and my first
</p>
<p>proof is from a French historian of great reputation at the pre-
</p>
<p>sent moment, one of the first of the French literati  M. Thierry,
</p>
<p>who in his History of the Conquest of England by the Nor-
</p>
<p>mans, says, in volume iii. page 430, '' The conquest of Ireland
</p>
<p>" by the Anglo-Normans is perhaps the only one that has not been
</p>
<p>" followed by a gradual amelioration in the'condition of the conquered
</p>
<p>"people. In England the descendants of the Anglo-Saxons, though
</p>
<p>" unable to free themselves from the dominion of the conquerors, ad-
</p>
<p>li vanced rapidly in prosperity and civilization ; while the natives of Ire-
</p>
<p>' land, after five centuries, exhibit a state of uniform decline, and yet
</p>
<p>621
</p>
<p>" they are endowed by nature with great quickness of parts, and a re-
</p>
<p>" markable aptitude for every description of intellectual labour. The
</p>
<p>" soil of Ireland is fertile, and adapted to cultivation ; yet its fertility
</p>
<p>" has been equally unprofitable to the conquerors and the conquered ;
</p>
<p>' and the descendants of the Normans, notwithstanding the extent of
</p>
<p>" their possessions, have become gradually as impoverished as the Irish
</p>
<p>(t themselves. This singular destiny, which presses with equal weight
</p>
<p>" upon the ancient inhabitants and the more recent settlers of Ireland,
</p>
<p>" is the consequence of their proximity to England, and of the influence
</p>
<p>" which ever since the conquest the Government of the latter country
</p>
<p>" has constantly exercised over the internal affairs of the former."
</p>
<p>There is a disinterested historian giving this melancholy picture of
</p>
<p>centuries passing away without improvement, of poverty and destitu-
</p>
<p>tion increasing, all owing to the baneful influence, he says, of the
</p>
<p>English Government. The next authority I shall cite is that of Mr.
</p>
<p>Pitt, who, in discussing a commercial proposition in 1785, made this
</p>
<p>admission-: " The uniform policy of England has been to deprive Ire-
</p>
<p>ct land of the use of her own resources, and to make her subservient
</p>
<p>f to the interests and opulence of the English people." That is
</p>
<p>not my language, read from newspapers against me, avowing dis-
</p>
<p>tinctly that the policy of England was to use Ireland for her own
</p>
<p>purposes. My next authority is the late Lord Chief Justice of this
</p>
<p>Court, who, in opposing the Union in 1799, said: "You are
</p>
<p>"giving up your independence. To whom? To a nation which
</p>
<p>" for six hundred years has treated you with uniform oppres-
</p>
<p>" sion and injustice." These are the words of Bushe ; and if
</p>
<p>I had the arranging of this language I could not put it so powerfully
</p>
<p>or so strongly ; and by what expressions has it been followed up ?
</p>
<p>" The treasury bench startles at the assertion  non mens hie
</p>
<p>" sermo est. If the treasury bench scold me, Mr. Pitt will scold
</p>
<p>" them; it is the assertion in so many words in his speech. Ireland,
</p>
<p>" says he, has always been treated with injustice and illiberality.
</p>
<p>" Ireland, says Junius, has been uniformly plundered and oppressed.
</p>
<p>" This is not the slander of Junius, nor the candour of Pitt  it is

</p>
<p>" history. For centuries has the British Parliament and nation kept
</p>
<p>" you down, shackled your commerce, and paralysed your exertions;
</p>
<p>" despised your characters, and ridiculed your pretensions to any
</p>
<p>" privileges, commercial or constitutional. She has never conceded
</p>
<p>" a point to you which she could avoid, or granted a favour which
</p>
<p>" was not reluctantly distilled. They have been all wrung from her
</p>
<p>" like drops of her blood." The words are not mine, Gentlemen, they
</p>
<p>are those of Charles Kendal Bushe. " And you are not in possession
</p>
<p>u of a single blessing (except those which you derive from God), that has
</p>
<p>" not been either purchased or extorted by the virtue of your own Par-
</p>
<p>" liament from the illiberality of England." In 1798, when a Govern-
</p>
<p>ment pamphlet was first published by Mr. Secretary Cook, which first
</p>
<p>broached the subject of the Union, he says : " A Union was the
</p>
<p>" only means of preventing Ireland from growing too great and too
</p>
<p>"powerful." At the same lime admitting: " When one nation is
</p>
<p>coerced to unite with another, such union savours of subjection."
</p>
<p>622
</p>
<p>I will quote again from Lord Chief Justice Bushe. In de-
</p>
<p>nouncing England's intolerance of Ireland's prosperity, during the
</p>
<p>debates on the Union, he used the following language : " I strip
</p>
<p>" this formidable measure of all its pretensions and all its aggra-
</p>
<p>" rations ; 1 look on it nakedly and abstractedly, and I see no-
</p>
<p>" thing in it but one question  will you give up the country ? I
</p>
<p>" forget for a moment the unprincipled means by which it has been
</p>
<p>" promoted ; I pass by for a moment. the unseasonable time at which
</p>
<p>" it has been introduced, and the contempt of Parliament upon which
</p>
<p>" it is bottomed, and I look upon it simply as England reclaiming,
</p>
<p>"in a moment of your weakness, that dominion which you extorted
</p>
<p>** from her in a moment of your virtue  a dominion which she uni-
</p>
<p>" formly abused  which invariably oppressed and impoverished you,
</p>
<p>" and from the cessation of which you date all your prosperity. It
</p>
<p>" is a measure which goes to degrade the country, by saying it is
</p>
<p>** unfit to govern itself, and to stultify the Parliament by saying it is
</p>
<p>" incapable of governing the country. It is the revival of the odious
</p>
<p>" and absurd title of conquest ; it is the renewal of the abominable
</p>
<p>" distinction between mother country and colony which lost America ;
</p>
<p>" it is the denial of the rights of nature to a great nation from an
</p>
<p>** intolerance of its prosperity." From the commencement I told you
</p>
<p>I would prove that it was hatred of the prosperity of Ireland ; and if
</p>
<p>he who uttered that opinion were here to-day, he would avow it.
</p>
<p>These topics were almost forgotten, and I am obliged to the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General for having reminded me of them. I will read another docu-
</p>
<p>ment to prove that the English policy has always been against the
</p>
<p>amelioration of the Irish people. It is an extract from a letter from
</p>
<p>Primate Bouller to the Duke of Newcastle, which is dated Dublin,
</p>
<p>January 9th, 1724 : " 1 have made it my business to talk with several
</p>
<p>" of the most leading men in Parliament, and have employed others
</p>
<p>" to pick up what they could learn from a variety of people ; and I
</p>
<p>" find by my own and others' inquiries that the people of every re-
</p>
<p>" ligion, country, and party here, are alike set against Wood's half-
</p>
<p>" pence, and that their agreement in this has had a very unhappy

</p>
<p>" influence on the state of this nation, by bringing on intimacies be-
</p>
<p>" tween Papists and Jacobites, and the Whigs, who before bad no
</p>
<p>" correspondence with them: so it is questioned whether (if there
</p>
<p>" were occasion) the justices of the peace could be found who would
</p>
<p>" be strict in disarming the Papists." Here, Gentlemen, we have
</p>
<p>an honoured prelate saying, that it is a most unhappy thing that the
</p>
<p>Papists and Whigs should come together on terms of intimacy and
</p>
<p>conciliation. This is the spirit of English domination which I com-
</p>
<p>plained of; and I ask you, have I not proved what I promised from Bushe
</p>
<p>Pitt, and Boulter?  and I conjure you above all things to remem-
</p>
<p>ber the declaration of the first of these men, who said the Union
</p>
<p>was passed from " the intolerance of Irish prosperity."
</p>
<p>I will next bring you to 1782, and detain you but a short time
</p>
<p>upon the subject, which, I am sure, is one familiar to every Irish
</p>
<p>mind, as the only bright spot in our history  the only green island in
</p>
<p>this desert, the oasis in the misrule and misconduct which surround us.
</p>
<p>623
</p>
<p>The transaction of '82 should never be forgotten. It was of the most
</p>
<p>consummate advantage to England ; she assailed America  America
</p>
<p>was disaffected and resisted, and from her rebellion formed a revolution
</p>
<p>which made Ireland's assistance necessary for England's safety, for she
</p>
<p>had not troops to garrison the country. Did the Irish nobility or gentry
</p>
<p>then talk of separating from England ? No ! the idea was foreign from
</p>
<p>every Irish mind, but they required the assertion of their rights  free
</p>
<p>trade, and legislative independence. It was not prudent to refuse
</p>
<p>them, for they were loyal but determined. England conceded re-
</p>
<p>luctantly at the very time when a letter was written to Ireland,
</p>
<p>saying, " will nobody stop that madman Grattan." Nobody did
</p>
<p>stop him, and he effected that glorious revolution. This is but a part
</p>
<p>of the history of the British monarchy, which declared the adjust-
</p>
<p>ment of 1782 final, in order to leave no question open for future
</p>
<p>discussion. The King, Lords, and Commons of England asserted,
</p>
<p>and the Lord Lieutenant in Ireland declared the same in the Irish
</p>
<p>Parliament  but how is it attempted to be got rid of?  for Mr. Fox
</p>
<p>said on the 8th of April, 1782, " that no country had a right to hold
</p>
<p>the sovereignty of another country without the will of that other."
</p>
<p>Such were the principles upon which the settlement was brought
</p>
<p>about, and does one of the Gentlemen whom I address know a
</p>
<p>volunteer of '82 that did not glory in the victory ? No ! for it gave
</p>
<p>them a firmer hold of England  redoubled their allegiance to the
</p>
<p>Crown, and the connexion which existed by reason of that salutary
</p>
<p>action. I may be asked whether I have proved that the prophecy
</p>
<p>of Fox was realized  that the prosperity that was promised to Ire-
</p>
<p>land was actually gained by reason of her legislative independence.
</p>
<p>Now, pray, listen to me ; I will tell you the evidence by which I shall
</p>
<p>demonstrate this fact. It is curious that the first of them is from
</p>
<p>Mr. Pitt again, in the speech he made in 1799 in favour of the reso-
</p>
<p>lutions for carrying the Union. If he could have shown that Ireland
</p>
<p>was in distress and destitution  that her commerce was lessened 
</p>
<p>that her manufactures were diminished  that she was in a state of
</p>
<p>suffering and want by reason of or during the legislative indepen-

</p>
<p>dence of the country, of course he would have made it his topic, in
</p>
<p>support of his case, to show that a separate Legislature had worked
</p>
<p>badly, and produced calamities and not blessings, but the fact was too
</p>
<p>powerful for him. He had ingenuity to avail himself of the fact,
</p>
<p>which fact he admitted, and let us see how he admitted it. He admitted
</p>
<p>the prosperity of Ireland, and here was his reasoning. Now, mark it :
</p>
<p>" As Ireland," he said, " was so prosperous under her own Parliament,
</p>
<p>" we can calculate that the amount of that prosperity will be trebled
</p>
<p>" under a British Legislature." He first quoted a speech of Mr.
</p>
<p>Foster's, in 1785, in these words: " The exportation of Irish produce
</p>
<p>" to England amounts to two millions and a half, annually, and the
</p>
<p>" exportation of British produce to Ireland amounts to one million."
</p>
<p>Instead of saying you are in want ami destitution, unite with England
</p>
<p>and you will be prosperous ; he was driven to admit this : " Ireland is
</p>
<p>" prosperous now with her own Parliament, but it will be trebly pros-
</p>
<p>" perous when you give up that Parlimenl, or have it joined with the
</p>
<p>" Parliament of England." So absurd a proposition was never yet
</p>
<p>G24
</p>
<p>uttered ; but it shows how completely forced he was to admit
</p>
<p>Irish prosperity, when no other argument was left in his power but
</p>
<p>the absurd observation I have read to you. He gives another quo-
</p>
<p>tation from Foster, in which it is said: "Britain imports annually,
</p>
<p>" 2,500,000 of our products, all, or very nearly all, duty free, and
</p>
<p>" we import almost a million of her's, and raise a revenue on almost
</p>
<p>" every article of it ; " this relates to the year 1785. Pitt goes on
</p>
<p>to say : " But how stands the case now (1799)? The trade at this
</p>
<p>" time is infinitely more advantageous to Ireland. It will be proved
</p>
<p>" from the documents I hold in my hand, as far as relates to the
</p>
<p>" mere interchange of manufactures, that the manufactures exported
</p>
<p>" to Ireland from Great Britain in 1797, very little exceeded one
</p>
<p>" million sterling (the articles of produce amount to nearly the same
</p>
<p>" sum) ; whilst Great Britain, on the other hand, imported from Ire-
</p>
<p>" land to the amount of more than three millions in the manufacture
</p>
<p>" of linen and linen yarn, and between two and three millions in pro-
</p>
<p>" visions and cattle, besides corn, and other articles of produce."
</p>
<p>" That," said Mr. Pitt, "was in 1785, three years after her legisla-
</p>
<p>tive independence, that was the state of Ireland." You have seen,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, that picture, you have heard that description ? You have
</p>
<p>heard that proof of the prosperity of Ireland. She then imported little
</p>
<p>more than one million's worth of English manufacture; she exported two
</p>
<p>and a half millions of linen and linen yarn, and adding to that the mil-
</p>
<p>lion of other exports. There is a picture given of her internal prosperity.
</p>
<p>Recollect that we now import largely English manufactures, and that
</p>
<p>the greatest part of the price of those manufactures consists of the
</p>
<p>wages which the manufacturer gives to the persons who manufacture
</p>
<p>them. Two millions five hundred thousand pounds worth of linen
</p>
<p>and linen yarn were exported, and one million of other goods.
</p>
<p>Compare that with the present state of things. Does not every
</p>
<p>one of you know that there is scarcely any thing now manufactured
</p>
<p>iti Ireland, that nearly all the manufactures used in Ireland are
</p>
<p>imported from England ? I am now showing the state of Irish
</p>
<p>prosperity at the time I am talking of. I gave you the authority

</p>
<p>of Foster (no small one) and of Pitt of Irish prosperity during that
</p>
<p>time. I will give you the authority of another man that was not very
</p>
<p>friendly to the people of this country  that of Lord Clare. Lord
</p>
<p>Clare made a speech in 1798, which he subsequently published, and
</p>
<p>in which I find this remarkable passage, to which I beg leave to direct
</p>
<p>your particular attention : " There is not," said his Lordship, " a
</p>
<p>" nation on the face of the habitable globe tvhich has advanced in
</p>
<p>" cultivation, in manufactures, with the same rapidity, in the same
</p>
<p>" period, as Ireland" (viz., from 1782 to 1798). That was the way
</p>
<p>in which Irish legislative independence worked, and I have in support
</p>
<p>of it the evidence of Pitt, Foster, and Lord Clare ; and Lord Grey,
</p>
<p>in 1799, talking of Scotland in the same years, says : " In truth, for a
</p>
<p>" period of more than forty years after the (Scotch) Union, Scotland
</p>
<p>" exhibited no proofs of increased industry and rising wealth." Lord
</p>
<p>Grey, in continuation, stated that  " Till after 1748 there was no
</p>
<p>" sensible advance of the commerce of Scotland. Several of her ma-
</p>
<p>625
</p>
<p>" nufactures were not established till sixty years after the Union, and
</p>
<p>" her principal branch of manufacture was not set up, I believe, till
</p>
<p>" 1781. The abolition of the heritable jurisdictions was the first
</p>
<p>" great measure that gave an impulse to the spirit of improvement in
</p>
<p>" Scotland. Since that time the prosperity of Scotland has been con-
</p>
<p>" siderable, but certainly not so great as that of Ireland has been
</p>
<p>" within the same period." Lord Plunket, in his speech in 1799, in
</p>
<p>one of Ins happiest efforts of oratory, speaks of her as of " a little
</p>
<p>" island with a population of four or five millions of people, hardy,
</p>
<p>" gallant, and enthusiastic, possessed of all the means of civilization,
</p>
<p>" agriculture, and commerce, well pursued and understood ; a Con-
</p>
<p>" stitution fully recognized and established ; her revenues, her trade,
</p>
<p>" her manufactures thriving beyond her hope or the example of
</p>
<p>M any other country of her extent ; within these few years advanc~
</p>
<p>" ing with a rapidity astonishing even to herself; not complaining of
</p>
<p>" deficiency in these respects, but enjoying and acknowledging her
</p>
<p>" prosperity. She is called on to surrender them all to the control
</p>
<p>" of  whom ? Is it to a great and powerful continent, to whom
</p>
<p>" nature intended her as an appendage  to a mighty people, totally
</p>
<p>" exceeding her in all calculation of territory or population ? No !
</p>
<p>" hut to another happy little island, placed beside her in the bosom of
</p>
<p>" the Atlantic, of little more than double her territory and popula-
</p>
<p>" tion, and possessing resources not nearly so superior to her wants."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I will now direct your attention to such
</p>
<p>documents as will tend to corroborate the facts contained in those I
</p>
<p>have already adverted to. You have heard that in 1810 a meeting
</p>
<p>was held in Dublin to petition the Legislature for a Repeal of the
</p>
<p>Union. I will read an unconnected passage from a speech delivered
</p>
<p>by a gentleman belonging to a most respectable house in this city.
</p>
<p>It is as follows: " Some of us remember this country as she was be-
</p>
<p>" fore we recovered and brought back our Constitution in the year
</p>
<p>" 1782. We are reminded of it by the present period. Then, as
</p>
<p>" now, our merchants were without trade, our shopkeepers without
</p>
<p>" customers, our workmen without employment ; then, as now, it

</p>
<p>" became the universal feeling that nothing but the recovery of our
</p>
<p>" rights could save us. Our rights were recovered : and how soon
</p>
<p>" afterwards, indeed as if by magic, plenty smiled on us, and we
</p>
<p>u soon became prosperous and happy.'' Let me next adduce the
</p>
<p>testimony of a class of citizens, who, from their position, and the na-
</p>
<p>ture of their avocations, were well calculated to supply important
</p>
<p>evidence on the state of Ireland, subsequent to the glorious achieve-
</p>
<p>ments of 1782. The bankers of Dublin held a meeting on the 18th
</p>
<p>of December, 1798, at which they passed the following resolutions:
</p>
<p>" Resolved,  That since the renunciation of the power of Great
</p>
<p>" Britain, in 1782, to legislate for Ireland, the commerce and pros-
</p>
<p>" perity of this kingdom have eminently increased." " Resolved. 
</p>
<p>" That we attribute these blessings, under Providence, to the wisdom
</p>
<p>of the Irish Parliament." The Guild of Merchants met on the
</p>
<p>14th of January, 1799, and passed a resolution, declaring: "That
</p>
<p>" the commerce of Ireland has increased, and her manufactures im-
</p>
<p>4l
</p>
<p>G2G
</p>
<p>" proved beyond example, since the independence of this kingdom
</p>
<p>"was restored by the exertions of our countrymen in 1782. Re-
</p>
<p>" solved,  That we look with abhorrence on any attempt to deprive
</p>
<p>" the people of Ireland of their Parliament, and thereby of their
</p>
<p>" constitutional right and immediate power to legislate for them-
</p>
<p>" selves." I have given abundance of proof, from extracts I have
</p>
<p>read, of the prosperity of Ireland under the fostering care of her own
</p>
<p>Parliament. I could multiply these extracts to show, from the most
</p>
<p>unsuspicious authorities, that nothing could exceed the prosperity of
</p>
<p>Ireland under the fostering care of her own Parliament. A Parlia-
</p>
<p>mentary document shows, that from 1785 to the period of the Union
</p>
<p>the increase in the consumption of teas in Ireland was 84 per cent.,
</p>
<p>while it was only 45 per cent, in England. The increase in tobacco
</p>
<p>in Ireland was 100 per cent., in England 64 ; in wine in Ireland 74
</p>
<p>per cent., in England 52 ; in sugar 57 per cent, in Ireland, and in
</p>
<p>England 53 ; in coffee in Ireland 600 per cent., in England 75. You
</p>
<p>have this proof of the growing prosperity of Ireland from the most incon-
</p>
<p>testible evidence. No country ever so rapidly improved as Ireland did
</p>
<p>in that period. There is a cant word used against Repealers. They
</p>
<p>are charged with seeking a dismemberment of the empire. The
</p>
<p>absurdity of that charge it is scarce necessary to demonstrate. If,
</p>
<p>when Ireland prospered under her own Parliament, in connexion with
</p>
<p>England, she showed no disposition to separate, why should she en-
</p>
<p>tertain a disposition to break the connexion if placed in similarly pros-
</p>
<p>perous circumstances ? What would she do it for ? I could understand
</p>
<p>dismemberment as an object attributed to a state of poverty and des-
</p>
<p>titution, but it is absurd to suppose such a disposition to exist with the
</p>
<p>prosperity which Ireland enjoyed under her own Parliament, and
</p>
<p>which, I trust, she will experience under her own Parliament again.
</p>
<p>It is melancholy to reflect that such an opening scene should have
</p>
<p>closed on Ireland, and that those fiends and monsters who closed
</p>
<p>it, should have been able to throw Ireland under the feet of a
</p>
<p>party who, in the words of Mr. Bushe, " were envious of the
</p>
<p>prosperity of Ireland." Yet it was so. It was that intolerance

<p>of our prosperity that induced the destruction of the Irish Par-
</p>
<p>liament, and the means taken to effect that destruction were
</p>
<p>suited to the nature of so deleterious an object. You have the

<p>authority of Mr. Fox, in 1806. " The Union was as atrocious in
</p>
<p>" principle as it was abominable for the means by which it was
</p>
<p>" carried. It was a measure the most disgraceful to the Govern-
</p>
<p>" ment of the country that was ever proposed or carried." The
</p>
<p>Attorney-General had referred to the Report of the Secret Com-
</p>
<p>mittee, in 1797; I refer you to a report in 1798, in which the Go-
</p>
<p>vernment were charged by Pluuketandby Bushe with having fomented
</p>
<p>the rebellion until it was deemed safe that it should explode. The
</p>
<p>first ingredient in the charge against the Government was that of
</p>
<p>having fostered the rebellion. The Report shows that Magrane,
</p>
<p>who was a Colonel in the organization of the United Irishmen in
</p>
<p>Ulster ; it will be recollected that the organization of the United
</p>
<p>Irishmen commenced in Ulster, and not in any of the other provinces ;
</p>
<p>027
</p>
<p>this Magrane, who was also a county deputy, and attended all their
</p>
<p>meetings, got into the pay of Government on the 4th of April, 1797,
</p>
<p>and from that day put the Government in possession of all the meet-
</p>
<p>ings, of all the names of the members who attended, and of all their
</p>
<p>proceedings; so that they could have arrested them at any moment,
</p>
<p>and put an end to the whole thing. But they did not do so. They
</p>
<p>waited for the ripening of the rebellion. This is confirmed by an
</p>
<p>authority quoted in the " Life of Grattan," vol. ii. p. 145 : " Lord
</p>
<p>" Clonmel shortly before his death, sent for his nephew, Dean Scott,
</p>
<p>" and requested him to destroy all his papers ; and from a letter in
</p>
<p>" Lord Clonmel's possession, it appeared he had gone to the Lord
</p>
<p>" Lieutenant, and told him it was wrong not to act on the informa-
</p>
<p>" tion they had, and crush the conspiracy." The Government re-
</p>
<p>fused to do so. Their object was to foment the rebellion, in
</p>
<p>order to carry the Union. The entire country rose against the
</p>
<p>measure, as far as they could ; but they were controlled and
</p>
<p>checked by the military power, and still more by their dissensions.
</p>
<p>Lord Plunket says : " I accuse the Government of fomenting
</p>
<p>" the embers of a lingering rebellion; of hallooing the Protestant
</p>
<p>"against the Catholic, and the Catholic against the Protestant ; of
</p>
<p>" artfully keeping alive domestic dissensions for the purposes of sub-
</p>
<p>" jugation." I will now read a passage from a speech made by Lord
</p>
<p>Grey, in the year 1800, on the repugnance of the Irish nation to
</p>
<p>the Union: "Twenty-seven counties," said his Lordship, "have
</p>
<p>" petitioned against the measure. Tbe petition from the county of
</p>
<p>" Down is signed by upwards of 17,000 respectable independent men,
</p>
<p>" and all the others are in a similar proportion. Dublin petitioned
</p>
<p>" under the Great Seal of the city, and each of the Corporations in it
</p>
<p>" followed the example. Drogheda petitioned against the Union ; and
</p>
<p>" almost every other town in the kingdom in like manner testified its
</p>
<p>" disapprobation. Those in favour of the measure, professing great in-
</p>
<p>" fluence in the country, obtained a few counter petitions. Yet, though
</p>
<p>" the petition from the county of Down was signed by 17,000, thecoun
</p>
<p>" ter petition was signed only by 415. Though there were 707,000

</p>
<p>" who had signed petitions against the measure, the total number of
</p>
<p>" those who declared themselves in favour of it did not exceed 3000,
</p>
<p>" and many of these only prayed that the measure might be dis-
</p>
<p>" cussed. If the facts I state are true (snd I challenge any man to
</p>
<p>" falsify them), could a nation in more direct terms express its dis-
</p>
<p>" approbation of a political measure than Ireland has done of a Legis-
</p>
<p>lative Union with Great Britain? In fact, the nation is nearly
</p>
<p>" unanimous, and this great majority is composed, not of bigots,
</p>
<p>" fanatics, or jacobins, but of the most respectable of every class in
</p>
<p>" the community." Mr. Bushe says: " The basest corruption and
</p>
<p>" artifice were exerted to promote the Union. All the worst passions
</p>
<p>" of the human heart were enlisted in the service, and all the most
</p>
<p>" depraved ingenuity of the human intellect tortured to devise
</p>
<p>" new contrivances for fraud. Half a million or more was ex-
</p>
<p>" pended some years since to break an opposition  the same, or a
</p>
<p>" greater sum, may be necessary now." And Grattan added : "That
</p>
<p>630
</p>
<p>" jected to him on that occasion, that he sought, hy giving large and
</p>
<p>" exclusive advantages to Ireland, to raise her up into a manufactur-
</p>
<p>" ing country, which should make her the rival of England and Scot-
</p>
<p>" land. While he disclaimed any such intention, he feared Ireland
</p>
<p>" was far indeed from any such prosperity." Gentlemen, would that
</p>
<p>occur in an Irish Parliament? If he was accused of making Ireland
</p>
<p>what she ought to he in commerce and manufactures, would he have
</p>
<p>disclaimed any such intention ? And what must have been that spirit
</p>
<p>of Parliament towards Ireland which made it necessary for a states-
</p>
<p>man to disclaim anything so atrocious, so outrageous, and so abomin-
</p>
<p>able as the intention of making Ireland the rival of England and
</p>
<p>Scotland ? You perceive from this the fatuity and folly of transfer-
</p>
<p>ring the management of your affairs to a Parliament wherein it was
</p>
<p>considered a reproach to make Ireland the equal of those countries,
</p>
<p>and now it is the imperative duty of every man who takes a part in
</p>
<p>politics to come forward and have a legislature which will not consider
</p>
<p>it a reproach but a praise to endeavour to make Ireland the rival of
</p>
<p>every country in commerce and manufactures. This fact speaks
</p>
<p>trumpet-tongued, and with a voice which I trust, will rouse you to just
</p>
<p>indignation against any attempt that may be made to put down
</p>
<p>the natural uprising  the peaceable and tranquil uprising  of the
</p>
<p>entire Irish people, to obtain the benefit of a native parliament.
</p>
<p>There is a document here, which I cannot avoid quoting for you :
</p>
<p>" The enormous excess of British over Irish debt at the Union, left
</p>
<p>" the British Minister no excuse for consolidation, and accordingly it
</p>
<p>" was arranged that the two debts should continue to be separately
</p>
<p>" provided for. The active expenditure of the empire (i. e. the ex-
</p>
<p>" penditure clear of charge of debts) was to be provided for in the
</p>
<p>" proportion of two parts from Ireland to fifteen for Great Britain.
</p>
<p>" These proportions were to cease, the debts were to be consoli-
</p>
<p>" dated, and the two countries to contribute indiscriminately by
</p>
<p>" equal taxes, so soon as the said respective debts should be brought
</p>
<p>" to bear to each other the proportions of the contributions, viz., as
</p>
<p>" two to fifteen ; provided also the fiscal ability of Ireland should be

</p>
<p>" bution was denounced at the time by Irishmen as too high for
</p>
<p>" Ireland, and afterwards so admitted by the British Ministers them-
</p>
<p>" selves. Its consequence was, to exhaust and impoverish her to
</p>
<p>" such a degree that her debt in sixteen years increased 230 per
</p>
<p>" cent., while the British only increased 66 per cent. This dispro-
</p>
<p>" portionate and unjust increase of the Irish debt brought about the
</p>
<p>" two to fifteen proportion between it and the British debt," It is
</p>
<p>delightful to me to have an opportunity of stating these facts in a
</p>
<p>place from which I know they will be extensively circulated. " Ad-
</p>
<p>" vantage was taken of that single hranch of the contingency contem-
</p>
<p>" plated in the Union Act, although the other branch of the contin-
</p>
<p>" gency, viz., the increase of Ireland's ability, had not only occurred,
</p>
<p>" but by the confession of the English Ministers themselver in 1816,
</p>

</p>
<p>" any further time contain, and rob Ireland of all chance of be-

<p>' nefit from any surplus of revenue, thenceforward and for ever."
</p>
<p>[Mr. O'Connell read an abstract of the taxes repealed and re-
</p>
<p>mitted in Great Britain and Ireland in 1815.] Here we find that
</p>
<p>England was increasing the taxation of Ireland at the rate of
</p>
<p>4,000,000 per annum, and such was the state of Ireland, that
</p>
<p>instead of this new taxation producing one 6d. of revenue, the
</p>
<p>actual precedent revenue fell 500,000 in the ensuing year. The
</p>
<p>debt of Ireland increased 230 per cent., while that of England in-
</p>
<p>creased only 60 per cent. Can it be possible that any one will say
</p>
<p>that that increase was necessary. What prosperity can you have
</p>
<p>under such a state of things? The moment you have any prosperity
</p>
<p>it will be converted into English revenue. The moment you are able
</p>
<p>to bear a new tax, it will be used not only to pay off your own debt,
</p>
<p>but to maintain increased English expenditure. Was there ever any
</p>
<p>thing which required greater vigilance than the pecuniary manage-
</p>
<p>ment of the country ? I have given you the most galling instances of
</p>
<p>the abuse of the power of mismanagement. I have given those in-

<p>stances from what, if they were not parliamentary documents you

<p>would not hesitate to credit the amount of robbery so open, plunder

<p>so obvious and so extensive, the accumulation of debt so entirely in-

<p>consistent with the supposed details of the Union, so inconsistent

<p>is the way the English strike off taxes for themselves ; that is the way

<p>that there can be prosperity while the management of your concerns

</p>
<p>will and mercy. Had you an Irish Parliament, they would insist on

<p>I have shown you what have been the financial effects of this

</p>
<p>632
</p>
<p>portance, as showing the opinions of those most competent to judge,
</p>
<p>respecting the means resorted to to carry the Union. It is the Pro-
</p>
<p>test of nineteen Irish peers against the Union. A number of resolu-
</p>
<p>tions and reasons are included in this Protest ; but I shall give you
</p>
<p>only two or three of them. [Mr. O'Connell read the 9th, 10th, and
</p>
<p>11th clauses of the Protest, in which the dissentients stated " that
</p>
<p>" they considered the Union a breach of trust, the settlement of '82
</p>
<p>" having established the exclusive legislative authority of the Irish
</p>
<p>" Parliament, without being liable to the interference of any other,
</p>
<p>" and the basest means, including the exercise of force and corrup-
</p>
<p>" tion having been employed to carry it," and then proceeded as fol-
</p>
<p>lows :] Such is the declaration of a large number of the Irish peerage
</p>
<p>as to the atrocity committed against this country by the carrying
</p>
<p>of the Union. I am sure there are none of their descendants living
</p>
<p>who must not glory in their relative who signed that Protest ;
</p>
<p>and I hope the time is not far distant when the intentions and
</p>
<p>the wishes of their ancestors may be carried into effect, when they
</p>
<p>shall take their seats in an Irish parliament sitting in College-green.
</p>
<p>Among other injuries resulting from the Union, is the total ina-
</p>
<p>dequacy of the representation of Ireland, as contrasted with that
</p>
<p>of England, and in particular, the infinitely less voice the people of
</p>
<p>this country have, by reason of the deficiency in the Parliamentary
</p>
<p>registry of voters. This is apparent from the Parliamentary Returns.
</p>
<p>I will take Westmoreland and Cork. The rural population of West-
</p>
<p>moreland is 43,464, and the number of registered voters 4,392; the
</p>
<p>rural population of Cork is 703,716, while the number of registered
</p>
<p>electors is only 3,835. In Bedford, the rural population is 88,000,
</p>
<p>and the number of registered electors 3,966; in Antrim, the rural
</p>
<p>population is 316,909; the number of registered voters only 3,487.
</p>
<p>The population of Hertford is 95,000, and the number of electors
</p>
<p>is 5,000; the population of Galway is 381,000, and the number of
</p>
<p>voters is 3,000. The same disproportion exists in almost every in-
</p>
<p>stance. The population of Wales is 800,000, and that of Cork, as I
</p>
<p>said before, is 703,716, and yet Wales sends twenty -eight members to

<p>Parliament, and Cork only two. With regard to revenue also, the defi-
</p>
<p>ciency in the amount of which, in Ireland, was an argument used
</p>
<p>against giving her a greater number of representatives, I find in Par-
</p>
<p>liamentary papers, published in 1832, that the revenue of Ireland
</p>
<p>amounts to 4,392,000 ; whereas the revenue of Wales only amounts
</p>
<p>to 348,000. I have looked into the statements of the amount of
</p>
<p>revenue collected in the single port of Cork, and I find that in one
</p>
<p>year it amounted to 263,000, and in another to 272,000 ; and yet
</p>
<p>the great disproportion I have stated in the number of representatives
</p>
<p>between that county and Wales is permitted to exist. Are you, Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, prepared to say that your countrymen are not qualified to
</p>
<p>exercise the elective franchise ? Are you prepared to say that they
</p>
<p>are unfit to be represented ? I am sure you are not. I am insisting
</p>
<p>that the Union is a mockery ; that it is not a union, but a servitude,
</p>
<p>on the part of Ireland ; that it is a compact entered into by England
</p>
<p>633
</p>
<p>for the purpose of holding greater power over us, of thwarting our
</p>
<p>prosperity for their own advantage, and of converting the property of
</p>
<p>Ireland to their own uses. Another complaint has been made, and
</p>
<p>justly made, of the inadequacy of the representation of Ireland. Ire-
</p>
<p>land, as you are aware, has only 105 members in the House of Com-
</p>
<p>mons, and I am prepared to show that upon Lord Castlereagh's own
</p>
<p>calculations, we ought to have 150 members at least. The want of
</p>
<p>legislative protection is sufficiently demonstrated in the ruin of our
</p>
<p>trade, in the downfall of all our commercial prosperity. Lord Castle-
</p>
<p>reagh, in making his calculations as to the number of representa-
</p>
<p>tives to which Ireland was entitled, used these ingredients  popu-
</p>
<p>lation, exports, imports, and revenue ; and he settled it that
</p>
<p>Ireland should have 108 members ; and with that 108 what did
</p>
<p>he do ? Why, he cut off the eight because it pleased him, and
</p>
<p>because Ireland was in his power. He committed that injustice
</p>
<p>knowing it to be one. Mr. Newenham corrected many of Lord
</p>
<p>Castlereagh's statements, and showed that his calculations in refe-
</p>
<p>rence to the proportion of revenue, were fallacies. Mr. Newenham
</p>
<p>took the rental in making his calculations. If you look to the finance
</p>
<p>report of 1831, you will see that the revenue of England was
</p>
<p>48,325,215, and the revenue of Ireland, 5,000,000, and upon that
</p>
<p>calculation the proportion of members Ireland ought to have is 176.
</p>
<p>Thus it is demonstrated that Ireland has been defrauded in her
</p>
<p>franchise, defrauded in her representation, defrauded even in the
</p>
<p>details of her finances, and defrauded in every one of the details of
</p>
<p>the Union.
</p>
<p>There is manifest inconvenience and injury inflicted by the Union
</p>
<p>as it stands. Is it not a great inconvenience to have a distant legisla-
</p>
<p>ture ? Is that not a great inconvenience to commercial pursuits, to
</p>
<p>agricultural prosperity, and to manufacturing purposes ? Is there a
</p>
<p>single trade that does not suffer from distant legislation? Not one.
</p>
<p>I have many particulars of the state of the different trades in Dublin,
</p>
<p>showing how they have been affected by the total neglect of the
</p>
<p>English Parliament. I will take the coal trade for example. [Mr.

<p>O'Connell then read reports of the Committee of the Commercial
</p>
<p>Buildings, in reference to the oppressive nature of the coal duty 
</p>
<p>and continued to say :] For eight years the merchants of Dublin
</p>
<p>and of Ireland complained of this burden. The Tories were in
</p>
<p>office  the Whigs succeeded  the violation of the Act of Union
</p>
<p>was palpable. The merchants had no redress from the Whigs, nor
</p>
<p>from the Tories. At length, the agitation for Repeal took place  the
</p>
<p>discussion was coming on  and the Whigs put an end to the grievance :
</p>
<p>and what they would not do in justice to the mercantile interest,
</p>
<p>they did at length from a prudent and proper motive ; and the ar-
</p>
<p>ticles of Union were in that respect carried into effect, and the
</p>
<p>duties taken off coal. I ask you, is it not inconvenient and un-
</p>
<p>necessarily expensive, that no private bill respecting any property,
</p>
<p>railway, or otherwise, could be passed without the enormous loss
</p>
<p>of time and money consequent upon going to London to attend a
</p>
<p>4M
</p>
<p>634
</p>
<p>Parliamentary Committee. What had happened in this very neigh-
</p>
<p>bourhood ? No less a sum than 28,000 had been expended on the
</p>
<p>bill for the Dublin and Drogheda Railway ; whereas if the Parliament
</p>
<p>were in College-green, 1,000 is as much as would have been ex-
</p>
<p>pended ; and I defy any man to think of carrying a bill in the Bri-
</p>
<p>tish House of Commons without some unhoped-for accession of funds
</p>
<p>if any opposition were offered. Can any thing be more fearful than
</p>
<p>the expense attendant upon election committees ? Every witness, if
</p>
<p>an Irish election be the question at issue, is taken to England, and
</p>
<p>kept there for a considerable time. If the witness is let to go for an
</p>
<p>hour, and new matter is started, the point probably will be decided
</p>
<p>in his absence, and you will lose your money, and possibly your seat.
</p>
<p>Would it not be just to the Irish Bar that these expenses should be
</p>
<p>circulated amongst them, while the fact is, not a single Irish lawyer
</p>
<p>profits by the matter  every shilling goes into the pockets of Eng-
</p>
<p>lish barristers. Are you not aware that a considerable mitigation of
</p>
<p>the expenditure sf the country has resulted from the different reve-
</p>
<p>nue boards existing in Ireland ? Are they here now ? What has
</p>
<p>become of the Treasury Board ? It has been transplanted to Eng-
</p>
<p>land. The Customs and Board of Excise ? Transplanted to Eng-
</p>
<p>land. The Stamp-Office, and other offices which have been greatly
</p>
<p>diminished in numbers, and are near extinction, the entire expendi-
</p>
<p>ture which mitigated the taxation of Ireland, have been all centered
</p>
<p>in England. The Old Man's Hospital was threatened with extinction.
</p>
<p>Is this principle of centralization fair which produces all those advan-
</p>
<p>tages to England, and all this misery to Ireland ? 1 shall now ask
</p>
<p>your attention to a statement of the number of English and Scotch-
</p>
<p>men appointed to offices in Ireland. I take it from the Mail.
</p>
<p>Let me first observe that the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland is an
</p>
<p>Englishman; the Chief Secretary is an Englishman; the Lord Chan-
</p>
<p>cellor is an Englishman. The writer in the Mail proceeds in answer to
</p>
<p>an article from the London Times relative to this topic of complaint:
</p>
<p>M The Archbishop of Dublin is an Englishman; the chief administra-
</p>
<p>" tor of the Irish Poor Law is an Englishman ; the Paymaster of Irish

<p>" Civil Services is a Scotchman ; the Chief Commissioner of Irish
</p>
<p>" Public Works is an Englishman ; the Teller of the Irish Exchequer
</p>
<p>" is an Englishman ; the chief officer of the Irish Constabulary is a
</p>
<p>" Scotchman ; the chief officer of the Irish Post Office is an English-
</p>
<p>" man ; the Collector of Excise is a Scotchman ; the head of the
</p>
<p>" Revenue Police is an Englishman ; the second in command is a
</p>
<p>" Scotchman ; the persons employed in the collection of the Customs
</p>
<p>" are English and Scotch in the proportion of thirty-five to one.
</p>
<p>" But the Times may, perhaps, observe  ' True, but all this is only
</p>
<p>" '.the elucidation of unbarring the gates of preferment unsparingly
</p>
<p>"  and honestly. Scotchmen and Englishmen are placed in office in
</p>
<p>" ' Ireland, and Irishmen, in return, in Scotland and England, in
</p>
<p>" ' order to draw closer the bonds of union between the three united
</p>
<p>" ' nations.' Again  Let us see how facts actually stand. There are
</p>
<p>" cabinet Ministers  Englishmen, 10 ; Scotchmen, 3; Irishmen, 0;
</p>
<p>035
</p>
<p>" The Duke of Wellington scarcely considers himself an Irishman,
</p>
<p>" and certainly cannot be called a representative of Irish interests in
</p>
<p>" the cabinet. Lords of the Treasury  Englishmen; 4 ; Scotchman,
</p>
<p>" 1 ; Irishman, I. Clerks of the Treasury  Englishmen and Scotch-
</p>
<p>" men, 112 ; Mr. Fitzgerald, (query an Irishman ?) 1. Members of

<p>" the chances of access to preferment to an Englishman or Scotchman
</p>
<p>" in Ireland, being in the few instances that have occurred to us
</p>
<p>" while writing, as 6 to 10 ; while the probability of an Irishman ob-
</p>
<p>" taining place in England appears, from an analogous calculation, to
</p>
<p>il be in the proportion of 491 to 10, or as 1 to 50. We could easily
</p>
<p>" swell this list were it necessary." I have read that to you, to show
</p>
<p>the meaning of the phrase, " Ireland for the Irish, and the Irish for
</p>
<p>Ireland." It is a perfect fallacy, a delusion to assert that the Irish
</p>
<p>are indemnified by promotions or appointments in England, for the
</p>
<p>loss of the appointments at home. The places in England and Scot-
</p>
<p>land are few enough for Englishmen and Scotchmen, and they give
</p>
<p>them the places in Ireland in addition. I proceed, Gentlemen, to
</p>
<p>show you other evil results from the Union. I quote from Mr. Fox's
</p>
<p>Remarks upon the State of the Nation, in 1807 : " The Union was
</p>
<p>" atrocious in its principle and abominable in its means. It was a
</p>
<p>" measure the most disgraceful to the Government of the country
</p>
<p>" that was ever carried or proposed. So far was he from thinking
</p>
<p>" that Great Britain had a right to govern Ireland, if she did not
</p>
<p>" choose to be governed by us, that he maintained that no
</p>
<p>" country that ever had existed or did exist, had a right to hold
</p>
<p>" the sovereignty of another against the will and consent of the
</p>
<p>" other."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, those who defend the Union and advocate its continu-
</p>
<p>ance, are in the habit of averring that our trade in the exportation of

</p>
<p>cattle has greatly increased since the passing of that measure, which in
</p>
<p>my mind has operated with a most disastrous influence on the fortunes
</p>
<p>of my country. But, Gentlemen, I hold in my hand a document by Mr.
</p>
<p>Halliday, which will demonstrate to you that this is a delusion, and will
</p>
<p>make you clearly understand how the real facts of the case are. Our cat-
</p>
<p>tle export had diminished bythe Union. Hear how the facts really are :
</p>
<p>K The defenders of the Union ordinarily lay much stress on the in-
</p>
<p>" creased export of cattle, sheep, and provisions, since that measure.
</p>
<p>" This export, however, is from a starving people; and being so, the
</p>
<p>" argument as to its great value to Ireland, is not one to waste much
</p>
<p>" time in considering. A curious fact has come out with reference
</p>
<p>" to this subject. A return appeared in all the Dublin papers, last
</p>
<p>" November, of the number of sheep and horned cattle at the great
</p>
<p>" fair at Ballinasloe, every year from 1790 to 1842. The following
</p>
<p>" extract from it we put in the same table, with figures, from a Par-
</p>
<p>" liamentary return of 1843, and the Irish Railway Report, showing
</p>
<p>636
</p>
<p>" the export of the articles mentioned in two of the years included.
</p>
<p>" We have no return of the export last year :
</p>

<p>" The question naturally arises, what became of the 77,000 surplus
</p>
<p>" sheep in the first year, as well as the sheep at other fairs ? They
</p>
<p>" were eaten at home. As to oxen, 14,000 went away in 1799, and
</p>
<p>" 98,000 in 1835 ; yet, if we test the product of all Ireland in the
</p>
<p>" former year, by the most sufficient criterion of the amount at Bal-
</p>
<p>" linasloe Fair, we shall find that Ireland had then more for sale than
</p>
<p>" in 1835, and consumed the greater part of the surplus over her ex-
</p>
<p>" port  exporting the remainder in the more valuable form of pro-
</p>
<p>" visions. The Parliamentary documents quoted before enable us
</p>
<p>" to show what the export of provisions was in the years 1799 and

<p>" There has then been, since the Union, a decrease of the more valu-
</p>
<p>" able export, viz., provisions, valuable because of the labour employed
</p>
<p>" at home in their manufacture; and an increase of the less valuable,
</p>
<p>" viz., the live animals, less valuable to a country as an article of ex-
</p>
<p>" port, by reason of the small quantity of employment which is given
</p>
<p>" in the preparingof it. As the diminution of the number of barrels of
</p>
<p>" beef and pork will not, by any means, account for the great increase
</p>
<p>" of the live export, while the whole number of cattle produced in
</p>
<p>" Ireland in 1835 was, at any rate, not greater than in 1799, it fol-
</p>
<p>" lows that much of the excess of live export in 1835 must have been
</p>
<p>" by deduction from the number previously consumed at home, and
</p>
<p>" therefore that the home consumption in the latter year was con-
</p>
<p>" siderably less than in the year before the Union, notwithstanding
</p>
<p>" the cent, per cent, increase of population." Gentlemen, you must
</p>
<p>bear in mind that the trade of cattle exportation is much more bene-
</p>
<p>ficial to the population of a country than made up provisions. The
</p>
<p>increase in the cattle exportation trade is indicative of a country's
</p>
<p>prosperity in a degree much more eminent than the increase in the
</p>
<p>provision trade. In fact, an increase in the latter branch of commerce
</p>
<p>isratherindicative of distress among the people. In the one case we have
</p>
<p>an evidence of prosperity, and in the other a clear proof of poverty
</p>
<p>G37
</p>
<p>u profitable occupation  so far as the exports and imports are sup-
</p>
<p>" plied from the parliamentary returns  exhibit an extraordinary
</p>
<p>" evidence of the condition of the labouring classes. The importa-
</p>
<p>" tion of flax seed (an evidence of the extent of a most important
</p>
<p>"source of employment) was, in 1790, 339,745 barrels; 1800,
</p>
<p> 327,621 barrels ; 1830, 469,458 barrels. The importation of silk,
</p>
<p>" raw and thrown, was, in 1790, 92,091 lbs. ; 1800, 79,060 lbs. ;
</p>
<p>" 1830, 3,190 lbs. Of unwrought iron, in 1790, 2,271 tons: in
</p>
<p>" 1800, 10,241 tons ; in 1830, 871 tons. Formerly we spun all our
</p>
<p>" own woollen and worsted yarn. We imported, in 1790, only
</p>
<p> 2,294 lbs ; in 1800, 1,880 lbs.; in 1826, 662,750 lbs., an enor-
</p>
<p>" mous increase. There were, I understand, upwards of thirty per-
</p>
<p>" sons engaged in the woollen trade in Dublin, who have become
</p>
<p>" bankrupts since 1821. There has been doubtless an increase in
</p>
<p>" the exports of cottons. The exports were  in 1800, 9,147 yards ;
</p>
<p>" 1826, 7,793,873. The exports of cotton from Great Britain were,
</p>
<p> in 1829, 402,517,196 yards, value 12,516,247, which will give
</p>
<p>" the value of our cotton exports at something less than a quarter of
</p>
<p>" a million ; poor substitute for our linens, which, in the province of
</p>
<p>" Ulster alone, exceeded in value two millions two hundred thousand
</p>
<p>" pounds. In fact, every other return affords unequivocal proof that
</p>
<p>" the main sources of occupation are decisively cut off from the main
</p>
<p>" body of the population of this country. The exports of live cattle
</p>
<p>" and of corn have greatly increased ; but these are raw materials ;
</p>
<p>" there is little more labour in the production of an ox, than the oc-
</p>
<p>" cupation of him who herds and houses him ; his value is the rent
</p>
<p>" of the land, the price of the grass that feeds him ; while an equal
</p>
<p>" value of cotton, or linen, or pottery will require, for its production,
</p>
<p>" the labour of many people for money. Thus the exports of the
</p>
<p>" country are now somewhat under the value of the exports thirty
</p>
<p>" years since, but they employ nothing like the number of people
</p>
<p>" for their production ; employment is immensely reduced ; popula-
</p>
<p>" tion increased three-eighths. Thus, in this transition from the
</p>
<p>" state of a manufacturing population to an agricultural, a mass of

</p>
<p>" misery, poverty, and discontent is created." By this statement
</p>
<p>you will see, that the importation of yarn increased, but that is no
</p>
<p>subject for felicitation, inasmuch as that that increase was obtained
</p>
<p>at the expense of a diminution in the home manufacture of the article.
</p>
<p>The next document to which I will take the liberty of directing your
</p>
<p>attention, is a report of Dr. Stack, in reference to the state of a va-
</p>
<p>luable charitable institution in this city. It is an important document,
</p>
<p>as clearly evidencing the effects of the Union upon institutions of this
</p>
<p>kind : " The Sick Poor Institution, since its establishment in the
</p>
<p>" year 1794, has shared in the sad reverses which the locality has
</p>
<p>" undergone over which its operations extended. The Liberties of
</p>
<p>" Dublin, once the seat of manufactures and of wealth, have dege-
</p>
<p>" nerated into the habitation of the decayed or unemployed artizan ;
</p>
<p>" the abode of fashion has now become proverbially the haunt of
</p>
<p>" vice, and poverty, and of disease ; hence, while the necessity for
</p>
<p>" such an institution as this has become every day more urgent, the
</p>
<p>638
</p>
<p>" supporters of it have proportionally diminished ; as the objects of
</p>
<p>" relief have increased, its friends have decreased. In order at once
</p>
<p>" to perceive this altered state of things, a mere inspection of the re-
</p>
<p>" turns made at the different periods is all that is necessary. In
</p>
<p> 1798, patients, 3,640; income, 1,035 17s. Id. 1841, patients,
</p>
<p>" 16,159; income, 367 4s. lOd." Thus, you will perceive that
</p>
<p>while the patients increased four-fifths, the income of the institution
</p>
<p>decreased in the proportion of three-fourths. I have now to submit
</p>
<p>to your consideration some melancholy details illustrating the disas-
</p>
<p>trous effects of the Union upon our national industry. I have a list
</p>
<p>here of the houses of the noblemen and gentlemen in Dublin in
</p>
<p>1800, which are now converted into hotels, or divided into small
</p>
<p>shops ; and, in fact, some of them are not occupied at all. I have a
</p>
<p>list of the manufacturers in the woollen, silk, and cotton trades, from
</p>
<p>which it appears that the number of tradesmen in Dublin in 1800
</p>
<p>amounted to 61,075; the number existing in 1834 was 14,446; of
</p>
<p>these there were then idle 4,412, showing a decrease of 51,041 in the
</p>
<p>employed. Need I dwell upon the evidences of ruined greatness
</p>
<p>and fading prosperity which every moment meet your eye as you
</p>
<p>walk through the streets of Dublin ? need I tell you how prosperity,
</p>
<p>happiness, and affluence, were once found to reside where nothing
</p>
<p>now can be found but misery, distress, and desolation ? I have a
</p>
<p>statistical statement of the decay of house property at hand, but I
</p>
<p>will not trouble you with a lengthened detail of it at this hour of the
</p>
<p>day. Take two or three of the leading mansions of this city, and
</p>
<p>mark to what they have been reduced. What has become of the
</p>
<p>house that was once the noble mansion of Lord Powerscourt's family.
</p>
<p>It has been a stamp-office ; it is now the counting house of a respect-
</p>
<p>able firm in the cotton, silk, and woollen trade. What has become
</p>
<p>of Lord Moira's house  that house which had been once the resi-
</p>
<p>dence of the Plantagenets in this country? Alas! are you not well
</p>
<p>aware that it is now the Mendicity? And that magnificent edifice,
</p>
<p>the Belvidere House, what sad reverses has it experienced? It cost
</p>
<p>28,000 in the building  the stairs alone cost 3,000; but the

<p>whole premises were the other day sold for a school to the Jesuits for
</p>
<p>1,100. And are those things to meet us every hour without mak-
</p>
<p>ing some effort for the restoration of the country ? It is not the want
</p>
<p>of materials that prevents me going further into this detail, but there
</p>
<p>is no necessity for it ; for you can see yourselves, Gentlemen, these
</p>
<p>mansions, where wealth and splendour formerly resided and were
</p>
<p>concentrated, ruined and neglected ; and the question is, will you
</p>
<p>endeavour to prevent those who are struggling to make a change to
</p>
<p>effect it ?
</p>
<p>I have now gone through the documents, to show you the pros-
</p>
<p>perity that existed in Ireland before the Union ; the advantages that
</p>
<p>she derived from her Parliament, and the violence of the means by
</p>
<p>which it was taken from her ; its injustice and inequality ; and I
</p>
<p>now ask you, I appeal to you, whether I have not presented a pic-
</p>
<p>ture which would make it the duty of every honest man to rally with
</p>
<p>me to remedy those evils by a restoration of that Parliament. You
</p>
<p>639
</p>
<p>have now distinctly my objects, and the objects of the men who are
</p>
<p>combined with me to obtain a Repeal, which is our proud boast, but
</p>
<p>that we are in a guilty combination we reject with scorn. We want
</p>
<p>to restore to Ireland, the authority and prerogative of the Queen, in
</p>
<p>the creation of the peerage  to the Irish peers their proper and he-
</p>
<p>reditary judicial authority, and to the representatives of the people
</p>
<p>the right of making their laws. You have a right to ask me the mode
</p>
<p>of obtaining this measure; you have a right to ask me the question, and
</p>
<p>I will answer it. One of our modes is not to use sectarian means in
</p>
<p>looking for a Repeal ; and while upon this subject, I wish to call your
</p>
<p>attention to what has already occurred on the part of those who la-
</p>
<p>bour with me. We never sought to sacrifice our country for any
</p>
<p>sect or party ; on the contrary, there cannot be more strong proof
</p>
<p>of anything than our utter abhorrence of such means, or of those who
</p>
<p>profess such to be their object. The Roman Catholics of Dublin
</p>
<p>held a public meeting in Francis-street, on the 9th April, 1795, where
</p>
<p>they declared, that feeling sincerely attached to their native country,
</p>
<p>to its rights and liberties, and so fatal do they consider the Union be-
</p>
<p>tween Great Britain and Ireland to be, that they were determined
</p>
<p>to resist it to the utmost, even though their own Emancipation was
</p>
<p>offered to them as a compromise. That was the way in which the
</p>
<p>Roman Catholics of Ireland met the question of the Union in 1795.
</p>
<p>[Mr. O'Connell then read a passage from the first speech he ever
</p>
<p>made in public. It was delivered on the 18th of January, 1800, and
</p>
<p>represented the opinions of the Catholics of Ireland then to be so
</p>
<p>hostile to the Union, that even if they were offered the alternative
</p>
<p>of the Union, or the re-enactment of the penal code, with all its
</p>
<p>horrors, they would prefer the latter ; and even if emancipation was
</p>
<p>offered to them for their consent to the Union, they would reject
</p>
<p>it with scorn and indignation.] That was my first public speech,
</p>
<p>These were the sentiments of myself and the Catholics of Ireland, with
</p>
<p>reference to the Union. We then made that offer  it might have
</p>
<p>been taken up, for there was at that time a very strong party in this coun-
</p>
<p>try, opposed to the assertion of the privileges of Roman Catholics. I

</p>
<p>then declared, as I do now declare, that I would prefer the enactment
</p>
<p>of the penal code, with all its black horrors, than have the Union; and
</p>
<p>that I would throw myself upon the consideration and justice of the
</p>
<p>Protestants of Ireland. Gentlemen, in 1810, you have already heard,
</p>
<p>the Repeal was brought forward, and public meetings were held in
</p>
<p>the city of Dublin. My speech upon one of those occasions has
</p>
<p>been read for you.  I will not distress you by reading any thing like
</p>
<p>the entire of it ; but allow me to read for you the concluding pas-
</p>
<p>sage, because it bears upon the topic I am now discussing. " The
</p>
<p>" Protestant alone could not expect to liberate his country  the
</p>
<p>u Roman Catholic alone could not do it  neither could the Presby-
</p>
<p>" terians  but amalgamate the three into the Irishman, and the Union
</p>
<p>" is repealed. Learn discretion from your enemies ; they have
</p>
<p>" crushed your country by fomenting religious discord  serve her by
</p>
<p>" abandoning it for ever. Let each man give up his share of the
</p>
<p>G40
</p>
<p>" mischief  let each man forsake every feeling of rancour. But I
</p>
<p>" say not this to barter with you my countrymen, I require no equi-
</p>
<p>" valent from you ; whatever course you shall take my mind is fixed:
</p>
<p>" I trample under foot the Catholic claims, if they can interfere with
</p>
<p>" the Repeal ; I abandon all wish for Emancipation, if it delays the
</p>
<p>" Repeal. Nay, were Mr. Percival to offer me to-morrow the Repeal
</p>
<p>" of the Union, upon the terms of re-enacting the entire penal code, I
</p>
<p>" declare it from my heart, and in the presence of my God, that I
</p>
<p>" would most cheerfully embrace his offer. Let us then, my be-
</p>
<p>" loved countrymen, sacrifice our wicked and groundless animosities
</p>
<p>" on the altar of our country ; let that spirit which heretofore ema-
</p>
<p>" nating from Dungannon spread all over the island, and gave light
</p>
<p>" and liberty to the land, be again cherished amongst us  let us rally
</p>
<p>" round the standard of Old Ireland, and we shall easily procure
</p>
<p>" that greatest of political blessings, an Irish King, an Irish House
</p>
<p>" of Lords, and an Irish House of Commons." Why then should
</p>
<p>we be charged with sectarianism ? Is that sectarianism ? Gentlemen
</p>
<p>of the Jury, you cannot but be all aware that the case of the Protes-
</p>
<p>tant Dissenters of England was warmly advocated by me  that I
</p>
<p>presented a petition in their favour, signed by 28,000 Roman Catho-
</p>
<p>lics, and adopted at an aggregate meeting of Roman Catholics.
</p>
<p>That petition was not on the table of the House of Commons six
</p>
<p>weeks when the Protestant Dissenters of England were emancipated.
</p>
<p>I scorn, therefore, and treat with the most sovereign contempt and
</p>
<p>indifference the idea of sectarianism. Throughout the entire mass
</p>
<p>of the voluminous evidence presented to you, has there been one
</p>
<p>word of sectarianism, or any thing like it ? I made more speeches
</p>
<p>than any other man alive, and I have been more abused than any
</p>
<p>other man on earth ; yet there is one calumny which has never been
</p>
<p>flung upon me  that one (and it is the only one) is bigotry of any
</p>
<p>sort. Religious bigotry against my fellow- Christians I have never
</p>
<p>been accused of, and why have my calumniators spared me upon
</p>
<p>that subject ? Because they knew the utter folly of attempting to
</p>
<p>make such a charge, while there never was the most trivial shadow

</p>
<p>of pretext for it. Sectarianism, I again say, is out of the question ;
</p>
<p>it, therefore, could not have been, nor is it even pretended to be
</p>
<p>alleged as our motive : I need not remind you that I who possessed
</p>
<p>the confidence of the Irish people, maintained it with the full and
</p>
<p>oft repeated declaration that all should be peaceable, and that one
</p>
<p>single act  one isolated act of violence of any sort  would detach
</p>
<p>me from the further agitation of Repeal. Has any violence pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded from me ? It has been said that I have made violent speeches;
</p>
<p>if I have, would it not be but fair to allow me the opportunity of
</p>
<p>showing how far these speeches were accurate or inaccurate, or what
</p>
<p>was explanatory or mitigatory, and not reserve them for so remote
</p>
<p>a period as this is from the time some of them have been de-
</p>
<p>livered. But no  there has been no violence on our side ; if
</p>
<p>violence is to be talked of, let us see is this violence. It is an ar-
</p>
<p>ticle taken from the Cheltenham Gazette and Stroud Herald, Au-
</p>
<p>641
</p>
<p>gust 2nd, 1841 : " What would in realily be justice to Ireland?
</p>
<p>" What would be the greatest blessing that could be conferred on
</p>
<p>" Ireland ? The answer to these questions is prompt, and comprised
</p>
<p>" in a single word  conquest. Few are the nations, if any, that
</p>
<p>11 are the worse for having been conquered. And in the great ma-
</p>
<p>jority of instances, as conquest implies superiority, the conquered
</p>
<p>" have been gainers. The Romans were conquered : and where
</p>
<p>" they conquered they also civilized. Now Ireland, though under
</p>
<p>" the dominion of England, has never been conquered by her. She
</p>
<p>" may take this in the light of a compliment or the reverse. To
</p>
<p>" this day she is wild, savage, uncivilized, scarcely human. We
</p>
<p>" speak of the mass of the people  of the aborigines of the island 
</p>
<p>" of the Popish part of the population  of the wretched and ferocious
</p>
<p>" slaves of O'Connell  of those who have never been brought under
</p>
<p>" the gentle sway of the Protestant faith. Had Ireland been actually
</p>
<p>" conquered by England it would not have been thus. The first step
</p>
<p>" towards the conquest of Ireland would be to send over a command-
</p>
<p>" ing military force, not to shed blood, but to prevent the shedding of
</p>
<p>" blood. Every individual Popish priest should then be secured and
</p>
<p>" exiled for life ; nor be permitted to return under the penalty of
</p>
<p>" death. And all persons found aiding and abetting a Popish priest
</p>
<p>" in secreting himself should also be condemned to exile for life.
</p>
<p>" These men, the priests, &c, might be shipped for some of the co-
</p>
<p>" lonies, and there receive allotments of land, and there be kept under
</p>
<p>" strict serveillance. Such is the simple outline of measures for the
</p>
<p>" bloodless conquest of Ireland. It is for a Conservative Govern-
</p>
<p>" ment alone to achieve this glory. Let Sir Robert Peel and his
</p>
<p>" colleagues look to it." Gentlemen, it appears by those papers,
</p>
<p>which were given in evidence, that we did not threaten any-
</p>
<p>thing; and it appears distinctly that every disclaimer, and repe-
</p>
<p>tition of disclaimer, to use anything but legal and peaceable means
</p>
<p>was given over and over again. There was no violence of any
</p>
<p>kind ; none whatever had taken place. We are now charged with a
</p>
<p>newspaper conspiracy because it is alleged that certain newspapers

</p>
<p>contained libels. Why, if they did, there is no person in the world
</p>
<p>more open to or capable of punishment for an offence than a news-
</p>
<p>paper proprietor. He is, perhaps, more in the hands of the law than
</p>
<p>any other man in existence. There is the Stamp-Office which must
</p>
<p>know all about him ; and the moment he offends they have nothing
</p>
<p>to do but call on him to account for his actions. The Attorney-Ge-
</p>
<p>neral had this facility if he wished, or if the libel law had been in-
</p>
<p>fringed. But there is one thing in the so-called newspaper conspiracy
</p>
<p>that cannot be got over. Take up the Nation which was read for you
</p>
<p> a great deal of prose and a considerable quantity of poetry 
</p>
<p>love songs and all  and then take the Pilot, which was also read
</p>
<p>for you  all prose and no poetry  take up any of these arti-
</p>
<p>cles, and can you say that one of the journals copied the other ?
</p>
<p>Cau they produce any of these papers, where the other copied an ar-
</p>
<p>ticle from it ? No, they cannot, and they could not charge them
</p>
<p>with conspiracy unless they joined for that purpose. In place of cor.-
</p>
<p>4N
</p>
<p>G42
</p>
<p>spiracy they would find discord, not concord, between them. There
</p>
<p>w r as not a particle of combination amongst them. In fact, there was
</p>
<p>not only no combination amongst them, but a kind of rivalship and
</p>
<p>jealousy relative to these articles. Was that like combination or
</p>
<p>crime? I will not go into that question at present, as it is so well
</p>
<p>ascertained.
</p>
<p>Well, Gentlemen, one word about the Arbitration Courts. I shall
</p>
<p>not trouble you with many observations on that head. One of the
</p>
<p>great advantages of these Courts, however, was the abolition of unne-
</p>
<p>cessary and superfluous oaths. There was no oath taken in these
</p>
<p>Courts at all. Gentlemen, I do not know if it strikes you in the same
</p>
<p>light as it strikes me on the subject of oaths; but I think the estab-
</p>
<p>lishing of such courts a great advantage in that respect. In the supe-
</p>
<p>rior Courts the oath is a different thing ; but I ask any Christian
</p>
<p>man, if he would not wish to see unnecessary swearing abolished. I
</p>
<p>find by a parliamentary return in 1832, that there were 172,000 oaths
</p>
<p>taken in the Excise department ; and in another year 158,000, in the
</p>
<p>excise also. This was an unnecessary profanation of the name of the
</p>
<p>Deity  158,000 oaths in one year, and 172,000 in another! What
</p>
<p>an enormous quantity of unnecessary oaths ! In the Arbitration Courts
</p>
<p>there was no oath whatever necessary. I shudder at the idea of so
</p>
<p>many oaths being taken in one year, and I had several conversations
</p>
<p>on the subject, and Lord Nugent did me the high honour to ask my
</p>
<p>assistance in bringing in a bill to abolish unnecessary oaths and sub-
</p>
<p>stitute a declaration in their stead. I consented, and we succeeded
</p>
<p>in passing a bill, substituting declarations instead of oaths ; and I hope I
</p>
<p>shall see the day when such a law will be extended even farther, for I
</p>
<p>abhor the taking of the sacred name of God in vain ; and the man
</p>
<p>who would tell an untruth in a matter of property, would not set the
</p>
<p>least value on his oath, nor would he at all scruple swearing to what
</p>
<p>he knew to be false, if he thought it ripe for his purpose. I hope
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, we will see the day when declarations like the Quakers',
</p>
<p>which are as binding on the conscience as the oath, will be substitu-
</p>
<p>ted and used as an oath by all Christian men and in all Christian

</p>
<p>countries. I am sure you will not ascribe conspiracy to that.
</p>
<p>Well, Gentlemen, I now come to the means by which we were
</p>
<p>to achieve the Repeal of the Legislative Union. The means are
</p>
<p>pacific, and I would not adopt any other means for the accomplish-
</p>
<p>ment of that sacred object. It was said that the meetings were not
</p>
<p>commensurate with the objects in view ; but the object was one that
</p>
<p>could not be obtained if the entire Irish people had not called for
</p>
<p>the Repeal of that Union. A change of that description should not
</p>
<p>be made unless it was demanded by the Irish people. The words of
</p>
<p>Grattan were, that the demand should be made, backed by the Irish
</p>
<p>nation. I re-echo that word, and the Minister is bound to oppose
</p>
<p>the Repeal of the Union unless that measure is backed by the nation.
</p>
<p>We have made the experiment, and we find that the mind of the nation
</p>
<p>is in favour of a domestic Legislature. We have made the experiment ;
</p>
<p>we did not do so without the enunciation of the voice of the Irish
</p>
<p>people. They have proclaimed it, they have declared if, from one end
</p>
<p>of the country to the other. The voice has gone abroad, and it only re-
</p>
<p>043
</p>
<p>mains for the peaceful organization of each locality to ensure success.
</p>
<p>When I brought the question before the House of Commons, the
</p>
<p>Members who supported it were small  only one Englishman, and
</p>
<p>not one Scotchman ; but what was the change since that time with
</p>
<p>respect to the measure? And is it not idle and absurd in the last
</p>
<p>degree to say that anything was intended save the regeneration of
</p>
<p>the country by the most peaceable means. What has the Crown
</p>
<p>read for you as part of the conspiracy ? Why, the rules of the As-
</p>
<p>sociation. [He proceeded to read the rules]. This, Gentlemen, is the
</p>
<p>plan of the Repeal Association. No alternative was held out by
</p>
<p>these rules, but the fullest allegiance, the most perfect loyalty, un-
</p>
<p>qualified peace, and in this way, and no other, was agitation to be
</p>
<p>conducted. Yet, under these circumstances, this combination is
</p>
<p>brought before you, and is called a conspiracy. That docu-
</p>
<p>ment, Gentlemen, is given in proof against us. Well, however,
</p>
<p>to carry their proof further, the Crown have read two other
</p>
<p>documents. The first is, "The Reconstruction of the House of Com-
</p>
<p>mons," and the second, ''The renewed Action of the Irish Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment." The first of these was signed upon the 14th of May, 1840,
</p>
<p>and the second upon the 22nd of August, 1843. Now, my Lords,
</p>
<p>this has been read against us as evidence of a conspiracy. And al-
</p>
<p>though it has been read before, I think it my duty to read it again.
</p>
<p>Mark, Gentlemen, that after taking the scale of representation from
</p>
<p>the returns of the population of the different towns, it begins at page
</p>
<p>7, thus. [Here Mr. O'Connell read the extract.] Part of the
</p>
<p>document has been read by the Crown, and it distinctly states that by
</p>
<p>Parliamentary means, and by Parliamentary means only, was Repeal
</p>
<p>to be obtained. I shall call your attention by-and-by to a portion of
</p>
<p>that document. The next document was also read, and I am entitled
</p>
<p>to the full force of all it contains. The Crown had no right to select
</p>
<p>portions from it, and I am entitled to the benefit of the unobjectiona-
</p>
<p>ble parts, for they had no right to suppress them. [He then read
</p>
<p>" The renewed Action of the Irish Parliament."] There, my Lords,
</p>
<p>is the evidence for the prosecution ; there is the evidence to prove a

</p>
<p>conspiracy ; there is the evidence to prove illegal means ; there is the
</p>
<p>evidence to prove illegal objects. Gentlemen of the Jury, I put it to
</p>
<p>you  it is not my evidence ; it is not I produced it ; it is not we who
</p>
<p>have called nponit in our defence, though it does contain, I think, an
</p>
<p>admirable defence; but it is brought before you on the part of the
</p>
<p>Crown, and produced by the Attorney-General ; that is the Altorney-
</p>
<p>General's evidence, and upon that evidence I call upon you to acquit
</p>
<p>us  you are bound to believe it ; there is the plan for Repeal ; what
</p>
<p>fault do you find with it ? There is a theory introduced into it, not
</p>
<p>called upon for practice, but I insist upon my right to discuss that
</p>
<p>theory. I may be wrong, but it is a great constitutional question
</p>
<p>which a man is at liberty to discuss, and form his opinions upon. The
</p>
<p>opinion may be erroneous, but the right, is undoubted, and I insist
</p>
<p>upon it that question ought to be considered in a way favourable to
</p>
<p>the claims of Ireland.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the competency of the Irish Parliament to pass
</p>
<p>the Act of Union was discussed long before the Union itself was
</p>
<p>G44
</p>
<p>thought of. One of the works by which the Revolution of 1688 way
</p>
<p>consolidated, was a book written by Locke upon Government. He
</p>
<p>wrote it for the purpose of sustaining the Whigs of that day (live
</p>
<p>Williamite Whigs), to prove that James had no title to the throne,
</p>
<p>and that William was the lawful monarch of England, in consequence
</p>
<p>of what had happened. That book, Gentlemen of the Jury, was a
</p>
<p>class book in Trinity College at the time the Union passed. It was
</p>
<p>a book out of which the young men were examined. Shortly after
</p>
<p>the Union it was found inconvenient to let it remain, and for some
</p>
<p>reason, I do not know the cause, it was withdrawn. But at one
</p>
<p>time it was a book of authority, and requiring not any college to give it
</p>
<p>authority; itwas thegreat instrumentby means of which the Revolution
</p>
<p>of '88 was achieved, the principle of which Revolution no man admires
</p>
<p>more than I do. In Locke's book on Government, I find : " The
</p>
<p>" Legislature (he says) cannot transfer the power of making laws into
</p>
<p>" other hands, for it being but a delegated power from the people, they
</p>
<p>" who have it cannot pass it over to others. The people alone can
</p>
<p>" appoint the form of the commonwealth, which is by constituting the
</p>
<p>" Legislature, and appointing in whose hands that shall be ; and when
</p>
<p>" the people will have said, we submit and will be governed by laws
</p>
<p>" made by such men and in such terms, nobody else can say other men
</p>
<p>" shall make laws for them. The power of the Legislature being de-
</p>
<p>" rived from the people by a positive voluntary grant and institution,
</p>
<p>" can be no other than what the positive grant conveyed, which being
</p>
<p>" only to make laws and not to make Legislatures, the Legislature
</p>
<p>" can have no power to transfer their authority of making laws, or
</p>
<p>" to place it in other hands." No doctrine can be more dis-
</p>
<p>tinct than that this delegated Legislature, elected for a time, had no
</p>
<p>power or authority to transfer the rights of their constituents to* any
</p>
<p>body else. Upon this subject Lord Grey was very explicit :
</p>
<p>Lord Grey (then Mr. Charles Grey) said in the British House of
</p>
<p>Commons : " Though you should be able to carry the measure, yet
</p>
<p>" the people of Ireland would wait for an opportunity of recovering
</p>
<p>" their rights, which they will say were taken from them by force."

</p>
<p>But I have still more explicit authority. Hear this passage from the
</p>
<p>speech of Mr. Saurin, spoken on the 15th of March, 1800, read by
</p>
<p>me on the trial of John Magee, in his presence, and adopted with
</p>
<p>manliness by the Attorney General of the day : " Those great men
</p>
<p>" had assisted in the Revolution of 1688; they had put down the
</p>
<p>" slavish doctrine of passive obedience ; they had declared that the
</p>
<p>" King held his crown by compact with the people, and when the
</p>
<p>" Crown violated that compact, by subverting, or attempting to sub-
</p>
<p>" vert, the Constitution which was the guarantee and safeguard of
</p>
<p>" that people's liberty, the Crown was forfeited, and the nation had
</p>
<p>" a right to transfer the sovereign power to other hands. They had
</p>
<p>" no notion of the doctrines, which he was sorry to see now received,
</p>
<p>' ; that the supreme power of the State was omnipotent, and that the
</p>
<p>" people were bound to submit to whatever that power thought pro-
</p>
<p>" per to inflict upon them. At that day such a monstrous proposition
</p>
<p>" as this would not have been tolerated, though now it began to raise
</p>
<p>" its head and threaten the Constitution. But he for one would not
</p>
<p>645
</p>
<p>" admit it; he would re-assert the doctrines of the glorious Revoltf-
</p>
<p>" tion, and boldly declare in the face of that House and of the nation,
</p>
<p>" that when the sovereign power violated that compact which at its
</p>
<p>" Revolution was declared to exist between the Government and the
</p>
<p>" people, that moment the right of resisting that power accrues. Whe-
</p>
<p>" ther it would be prudent in the people to avail themselves of that
</p>
<p>" right would be another question ; but, surely, if there be this right
</p>
<p>" in the nation to resist an unconstitutional assumption of power which
</p>
<p>" threatened the public liberty, there could not occur a stronger case
</p>
<p>" for the exercise of it than this measure would afford if carried
</p>
<p>" against the will of the majority of the nation." Nothing can be
</p>
<p>more explicit than that constitutional doctrine ; nothing can be more
</p>
<p>extensive than its operation. It was asserted by Saurin, quoting the
</p>
<p>highest authority of the heroes of the Revolution of '88, so he called
</p>
<p>the persons that carried that Revolution, that by the English Consti-
</p>
<p>tution the principle of passive obedience and non-resistance is totally
</p>
<p>foreign to our Constitution  the right to resist, rather a delicate ques-
</p>
<p>tion, commences when the contract is broken, but the existence of a
</p>
<p>constitutional right of that description shows it. The Revolution itself
</p>
<p>would be void if this doctrine were not true. He then goes on to say:
</p>
<p>" If a Legislative Union should be so forced upon this country
</p>
<p>" against the will of its inhabitants, it would be a nullity, and resis-
</p>
<p>" tance to it would be a struggle against usurpation and not a
</p>
<p>" resistance against law." That was alleged too, with reference
</p>
<p>to a period after the Union was carried ; that is, looking to its having
</p>
<p>all the sanction of form, the great seal of England on the one hand,
</p>
<p>the great seal of Ireland on the other, and the consent of the Crown
</p>
<p>given to it; yet Mr. Saurin, talking of constitutional doctrine, declared
</p>
<p>it to be a nullity, and resistance to it a matter of prudence. And in
</p>
<p>a second speech of his, which was published in the shape of a pamph-
</p>
<p>let: " You may make the Union binding as a law, but you cannot
</p>
<p>" make it obligatory on conscience. It will be obeyed so long as
</p>
<p>" England is strong, but resistance to it will be in the abstract a duty,
</p>
<p>" and the exhibition of that resistance will be a mere question of

<p>" prudence." I will be bound by it, says he, as a law, and so say I ;
</p>
<p>but it will be void in conscience and constitutional principle. It will
</p>
<p>be obeyed as a law, but it will be the duty of the people to exhibit
</p>
<p>that resistance to it, when it is prudent to do so. He did not mean
</p>
<p>by that resistance, force or violence ; he meant legal and peaceable
</p>
<p>means, but by means adequate to the purpose while they keep within
</p>
<p>the precincts of the law. There is another authority  Lord Plunket,
</p>
<p>he says: " Sir, I, in the most express terms, deny the competency
</p>
<p>" of Parliament to do this act. I warn you, do not dare to lay your
</p>
<p>" hands on the Constitution. I tell you, that if, circumstanced as
</p>
<p>" you are, you pass this act, it will be a mere nullity, and no man in
</p>
<p>" Ireland will be bound to obey it. I make the assertion delibe-
</p>
<p>" rately. I repeat it. I call on any man who hears me, to take
</p>
<p>" down my words. You have not been elected for this purpose.
</p>
<p>" You are appointed to make laws, and not Legislatures ; you are ap-
</p>
<p>" pointed to exercise the functions of legislators, and not to transfer
</p>
<p>646
</p>
<p>" them ; you are appointed to act under the Constitution, and nut to
</p>
<p>" alter it ; and if you do so, your act is a dissolution of the Govern-
</p>
<p>" ment ; you resolve society into its original elements, and no man
</p>
<p>" in the land is bound to obey you. Sir, I state doctrines that are
</p>
<p>" not merely founded on the immutable laws of truth and reason;
</p>
<p>" 1 state not merely the opinions of the ablest and wisest men, who
</p>
<p>" have written on the science of government, but I state the practice
</p>
<p>" of ourConstitution as settled at the era of the Revolution, and I state
</p>
<p>" the doctrine under which the House of Hanover derives its title to
</p>
<p>" the throne. Has the King a right to transfer his crown ? Is he com-
</p>
<p>" petent to annex it to the crown of Spain, or any other country ?
</p>
<p>" No ; but he may abdicate it, and every man who knows the Consti-
</p>
<p>" tution knows the consequence  the right reverts to the next in suc-
</p>
<p>" cession. If they all abdicate, it reverts to the people. The man
</p>
<p>" who questions this doctrine, in the same breath must arraign the
</p>
<p>" Sovereign on the throne as a usurper. Are you competent to trans-
</p>
<p>" fer your legislative rights to the French Council of Five Hundred ?
</p>
<p>" Are you competent to transfer them to the British Parliament ? I
</p>
<p>" answer  No ! If you transfer, you abdicate ; and the great origi-
</p>
<p>" nal trust reverts to the people from whom it issued. Yourselves
</p>
<p>" you may extinguish ; but Parliament you cannot extinguish. It
</p>
<p>" is enthroned in the hearts of the people  it is enshrined in the
</p>
<p>" sanctuary of the Constitution  it is as immortal as the island
</p>
<p>" ivhich it protects. As well might the frantic suicide hope that the
</p>
<p>" act which destroys his miserable body should extinguish his eter-
</p>
<p>" nal soul ! Again I, therefore, warn you. Do not dare to lay your
</p>
<p>" hands on the Constitution  it is above your powers." Oh, it is a
</p>
<p>beautiful passage: " As well might the frantic suicide hope that the
</p>
<p>" act which destroys his miserable body should extinguish his eternal
</p>
<p>" soul. Again I, therefore, warn you. Do not dare to lay your hands
</p>
<p>" on the Constitution  it is above your powers." I insist on the truth
</p>
<p>of that constitutional law. I take the qualification as laid down by
</p>
<p>Saurin; it is binding as a law while it continues to have the form and
</p>
<p>shape and pressure of law ; but it does not bind on conscience or

</p>
<p>principle ; though it had been said to me, " Why this would
</p>
<p>make all the Acts which were passed since the Union void." I
</p>
<p>deny it; it would do no such thing. I say they are voidable, but not
</p>
<p>void. It has been said, " You would by that repeal even the Eman-
</p>
<p>cipation Act." If I could get the Repeal of the Union, I would make
</p>
<p>you a present of Emancipation. Where do I find the principle of its
</p>
<p>being voidable not void ? I find it in the language of Saurin : "That
</p>
<p>it is binding as a law ; but not obligatory on conscience." I may
</p>
<p>be wrong in this position, but I cannot be wrong to argue from it. It
</p>
<p>may be said that this Act is to be obeyed, and it is to be considered
</p>
<p>as law. Gentlemen of the Jury, the point was raised already in 1782,
</p>
<p>when the Irish Parliament declared that no power on earth could bind
</p>
<p>the Irish people but the King, Lords, and Commons of Ireland. And
</p>
<p>there was an Act passed to that effect, the consequence of which was
</p>
<p>to do away with the authority of all laws passed in England, and
</p>
<p>G4T
</p>
<p>which were binding on Ireland, though they regulated the property
</p>
<p>of Ireland ; but Chief Baron Yelverton stepped in, and, by his Act,
</p>
<p>declared all laws passed in England to be binding in Ireland, and that
</p>
<p>they should continue to be so. But it may be said this is inconsist-
</p>
<p>ent with our allegiance. I deny it; for this authority exists in the
</p>
<p>Queen, which can only be exercised through her responsible Minis-
</p>
<p>ter. It is no derogation of her power ; it is rather an increase of that
</p>
<p>power. And shall I be told this by a country which had made so
</p>
<p>many irregular successions? Richard II. was dethroned by Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment ; so was Henry VI., so was Richard III., and Henry VII. set
</p>
<p>up. Where also the royal succession was altered over and over again
</p>
<p>in the reign of Henry VIII. and settled in nothing ; there was ano-
</p>
<p>ther alteration at the time of the Revolution, in 1688 ; so that there
</p>
<p>could not be anything illegal in discussing this question. Surely not.
</p>
<p>There may be a mistake, there may be an error ; but there cannot
</p>
<p>be a crime to discuss the matter publicly, undisguisedly, and with the
</p>
<p>sustentation of the authorities 1 have cited. You have Saurin and
</p>
<p>Plunket, you have Locke, you have Lord Grey giving his opinion in
</p>
<p>favour of it.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, 1 draw to a close. I now come back to the
</p>
<p>evils of the Union, and I would look to every honest man to exert
</p>
<p>himself for its Repeal. Would it not cure the odious evils of ab-
</p>
<p>senteeism ? It was calculated by an able man that 9,000,000
</p>
<p>a year pass out of this country ; the Railway Commissioners reduce
</p>
<p>it to 6,000,000. Take the reduced amount, and I ask did ever a
</p>
<p>country suffer such an odious drain of 6,000,000 of absentee money ?
</p>
<p>6,000,000 raised every year in this country, not to fructify it, not
</p>
<p>to employ the people of the country, not to take care of the sick and
</p>
<p>poor, or desolate, but 6,000,000 are transplanted to foreign lands ;
</p>
<p>sent there, but giving no return ; leaving poverty to those whom it
</p>
<p>enriched. Take 6,000,000 for the last ten years. Look now
</p>
<p>at 60,000,000 drawn from this unhappy country. Take it for
</p>
<p>the next six years ; can you in conscience encourage this ? There
</p>
<p>is a cant that agitation prevents the influx of capital. What is

</p>
<p>the meaning of that ? We do not want English capital ; leave
</p>
<p>us our own 6,000,000, and we shall have capital in abundance.
</p>
<p>We do not want that left-handed benevolence, which would drain the
</p>
<p>country with one hand, and let in niggardly with the other. There is
</p>
<p>another item, the surplus revenue, which exhausts the resources of this
</p>
<p>country, and that to the amount of nearly 2,000,000 annually ; in the
</p>
<p>last year it was low as 700,000 ; but whether the one or the other, it
</p>
<p>is drawn out of the country never to return. There is, again, the
</p>
<p>Woods and Forests. That department receives 74,000 a year out
</p>
<p>of Ireland, in quit-rents, &c. How was that expended for the last
</p>
<p>ten years ? Between the Thames Tunnel and to ornament Trafalgar-
</p>
<p>square. We want an additional bridge in Dublin  why have we not
</p>
<p>the 74,000 for that purpose ? Have we not as good a right as that
</p>
<p>it should be expended on Trafalgar-square ? If we had the Parliament
</p>
<p>in College-green would that 74,000 be sent to adorn a square in
</p>
<p>London ? Have we not sites and squares enough in Dublin for the
</p>
<p>G48
</p>
<p>purposes of public utility ? There are other evils attending this conti-
</p>
<p>nued drain on the country. I remember there having been quoted
</p>
<p>in Parliament the work of Mr. Young, a political economist, who
</p>
<p>journeyed in Ireland in '78, who, in speaking of the increase of
</p>
<p>population, accounted for it by the never-failing bellyfull of
</p>
<p>potatoes; they had all a bellyfull of potatoes, and to that he attri-
</p>
<p>buted the increase. But is that the case now? Has not the
</p>
<p>country sensibly declined  is not even one meal of potatoes a
</p>
<p>treat and a treasure? According to the evidence of the Com-
</p>
<p>missioners of Poor Law Inquiry the people are now in rags.
</p>
<p>Was this my language ? No, Gentlemen, I appeal to yourselves 
</p>
<p>are they not reduced to misery and wretchedness, frittered away by
</p>
<p>periodical famine ? and there were six or eight since the Union.
</p>
<p>There was relief from England, while provisions were in quantities
</p>
<p>exported from this country ; provisions were exported while the people
</p>
<p>were perishing with famine. But the Poor Law Commissioners report
</p>
<p>the following frightful picture. But first let me tell you that the
</p>
<p>Population Commissioners' Report shows the aggravation of the evil.
</p>
<p>The gentleman who made that Report is a military officer  Captain
</p>
<p>Larcom  a man of science, of integrity, and of honour. He reports
</p>
<p>the state of the population to be this, that 30 per cent, of the town
</p>
<p>and city population were in abject poverty, and that 70 per cent, of
</p>
<p>the agricultural were in abject poverty. These are not my words,
</p>
<p>they are the words of Captain Larcom. Where, then, are the advan-
</p>
<p>tages of the Union, which has thus increased poverty, bringing pes-
</p>
<p>tilence, and involving our poor in misery and filth ? Gentlemen, why
</p>
<p>should we not adopt any plan by which we would escape from
</p>
<p>these horrors? The Poor Law Commissioners go more into minute
</p>
<p>details. Mind you, Gentlemen, this is evidence made on oath be-
</p>
<p>fore the Poor Law Commissioners. Allow me to read some of it to
</p>
<p>you. " One family had but one meal for the space of three days;
</p>
<p>another subsisted on a quart of meal a day; another lived on a
</p>
<p>little boiled cabbages without anything to mix with them." Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, I will not harrow your feelings by reading any more, the

<p>book is full of them; and are 2,300,000 of your fellow-country-
</p>
<p>men to live in a state of positive destitution, and nothing to be
</p>
<p>done for them ? Is no effort to be made to rescue the country from
</p>
<p>this state of destitution ? Permit me to call your attention to a
</p>
<p>few passages of a report of a meeting held last Monday week,
</p>
<p>in reference to the sick and indigent of your city. [Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell read an extract form Saunders, detailing the misery which
</p>
<p>pervaded the city. J Can any language of mine describe the misery
</p>
<p>which exists more fully? Gentlemen, another hideous feature of
</p>
<p>Captain Larcom's Report is, that the population is diminished by
</p>
<p>70,000 from the period of 1821 to 1831; and from that to 1841
</p>
<p>the population has diminished by the number of 70,000, who would
</p>
<p>have been all reared up if they had anything to support them.
</p>
<p>And are we to he hunted down, who are the friends of the poor?
</p>
<p>Are we, who wish to have industry rewarded  are we, I ask it on
</p>
<p>every principle of sense and justice, are we to be prosecuted and
</p>
<p>649
</p>
<p>prosecuted for seeking the means of relieving; this distress ? We
</p>
<p>have the means of relief in our power; we live in the most fer-
</p>
<p>tile country in the world ; no country is in possession of such harbours,
</p>
<p>the early historical mention of which is made by Tacitus, admitting
</p>
<p>that our harbours are the best, and that consequently they were more
</p>
<p>crowded. The country is intersected with noble estuaries. Ships of
</p>
<p>five hundred tons burden ride into the heart of the country, safe from
</p>
<p>every wind that blows. No country possesses such advantages for
</p>
<p>commerce ; the machinery of the world might be turned by the water-
</p>
<p>power of Ireland. Take the map, and dissect it, and you will find
</p>
<p>that a good harbour is not more remote from any spot in Ireland than
</p>
<p>thirty miles. Why is not the country prosperous? Did I not read
</p>
<p>for you of the unheard-of magical prosperity that followed her legisla-
</p>
<p>tive independence ? Did I not read extracts from the writings and
</p>
<p>speeches of men most adverse to Ireland  of men most anxious to con-
</p>
<p>ceal her greatness as evidence of her increasing prosperity under her
</p>
<p>Parliament ? What happened once will surely happen again. Oh, Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, 1 struggle to rescue the poor from poverty, and to give wages
</p>
<p>and employment to those now idle ; to keep our gentry at home by an
</p>
<p>absentee tax, after the example of the Government last year, if by no
</p>
<p>other means, and compel them to do their duty to their country. I
</p>
<p>leave the case to you ; I deny that there is anything in it to stain me
</p>
<p>with a conspiracy; I reject with contempt the appellation. I have
</p>
<p>acted in the open day, in the presence of the Government, in the pre-
</p>
<p>sence of the magistrates; nothing was secret, private, or concealed ;
</p>
<p>there was nothing but what was exposed to the universal world. I
</p>
<p>have struggled for the restoration of the Parliament to my native coun-
</p>
<p>try. Others have succeeded in their endeavours, and some have failed;
</p>
<p>but, succeed or fall, it is a glorious struggle. It is a struggle to make
</p>
<p>the fairest land on earth possess that bounty and benefit which God
</p>
<p>and Nature intended.

<p>We have gone through the evidence already adduced on the part of
</p>
<p>the Crown, and we mean to rest our defence on it. We have brought
</p>
<p>a considerable number of witnesses to town  they are in town at pre-
</p>
<p>sent, and are able to prove a number of facts ; but under the circum-
</p>
<p>stances which I have stated, we have come to the conclusion that we
</p>
<p>should not be warranted in taking up the time of the Court, to estab-
</p>
<p>lish what has been already proved. We shall therefore examine but
</p>
<p>very few witnesses.
</p>
<p>Mr. Frederick William Conway sworn, and examined by
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell.
</p>
<p>I am proprietor of the Dublin Evening Post. I reside at Rath-
</p>
<p>mines-road, near this cilv. and I was a resident of Dublin in the year
</p>
<p>4o
</p>
<p>650
</p>
<p>1810. I was editor of the Freeman's Journal at that time, and in
</p>
<p>that capacity I was in the hahit of attending public meetings in this
</p>
<p>metropolis for the discussion of questions of importance. I recollect
</p>
<p>attending in 1810, at the Royal Exchange, at a public meeting con-
</p>
<p>vened for the discussion of Repeal. Mr. O'Connell, whom I knew
</p>
<p>personally at that time, also attended, and spoke at that meeting. Sir
</p>
<p>James Riddell, the High Sheriff of the city of Dublin, at the time,
</p>
<p>acted as chairman, and there were also several other persons of res-
</p>
<p>pectability and influence present. [The Freeman's Journal of Sep-
</p>
<p>tember 19, 1810, was handed to the Witness]. I was present at that
</p>
<p>meeting myself. I acted as secretary to it. It purported to be a
</p>
<p>meeting of the citizens of Dublin. I read these proceedings last night,
</p>
<p>as reported in this newspaper, and I have a perfect recollection of
</p>
<p>what passed. The meeting was held on the 18th of September, 1810,
</p>
<p>and a petition, praying for a Repeal of the Union, was adopted. The
</p>
<p>leading persons at the meeting were, Mr. Shaw, the present Sir Ro-
</p>
<p>bert Shaw, who acted as second chairman, Colonel Talbot, of Ma-
</p>
<p>lahide, and many others. I am quite satisfied that the topics of
</p>
<p>Mr. O'ConnelPs speech, as reported, are correct ; but a second
</p>
<p>speech appeared in the Freeman's Journal, and I think that was
</p>
<p>more correct, as the periods and sentences were better rounded.
</p>
<p>The reason the second report of Mr. O'Connell's speech appeared in
</p>
<p>the newspaper was, because the first was not very well reported, for
</p>
<p>we had not at that time so good a corps of reporters as we have at
</p>
<p>present.
</p>
<p>[The Witness then read Mr. O'Connell's speech in support of
</p>
<p>Repeal. See ante, p. 113.]
</p>
<p>I am now connected with the Dublin Evening Post. In the year
</p>
<p>1800, John Magee was, I believe, proprietor of that paper. I perceive
</p>
<p>in the file of the Evening Post of the 4th of January, 1800, now
</p>
<p>handed to me a report, headed, " The Union  Catholic Meeting."
</p>
<p>[The report of the meeting, containing a speech of Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>against the Union, was here read by Sir Colman O'Loghlen. The
</p>
<p>resolutions against the Union agreed to at the meeting were then

<p>read, as were also addresses to Mr. Grattan and Sir Robert Shaw,
</p>
<p>members for the city of Dublin, with their answers, printed in the
</p>
<p>Freeman 's Journal of the 5th of October, 1810. The addresses
</p>
<p>requested the honourable members to support the prayer of a peti-
</p>
<p>tion adopted at an aggregate meeting of the freeholders and free-
</p>
<p>men of the city of Dublin, in favour of a Repeal of the Union.
</p>
<p>The honourable members, in their answers, promised to support the
</p>
<p>petition. The requisition, convening the meeting, with the signa-
</p>
<p>tures attached, was then also read.]
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell.  Do you remember the Catholic Association pre-
</p>
<p>vious to 1829 ? I do.
</p>
<p>Were you a member of that Association ? I was.
</p>
<p>You then were connected with the Evening Post. Was it circu-
</p>
<p>lated by the Catholic Association in the same manner as other papers
</p>
<p>were circulated by the Repeal Association?
</p>
<p>The Attorney- General.  This is not evidence. It has nothing
</p>
<p>to do with the question under discussion.
</p>
<p>651
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  I think the objection comes too
</p>
<p>late, after you have allowed the other documents to be read.
</p>
<p>The Attorney- General.  The documents which were read, were
</p>
<p>speeches made by Mr.O'Connell, and had reference to the present
</p>
<p>questions, and we did not wish to exclude matters which had a distinct
</p>
<p>reference to a Repeal of the Union ; but this is a distinct class of
</p>
<p>evidence altogether. The proceedings of the Catholic Association
</p>
<p>have nothing to say to the issue at present to be tried.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  It cannot be received; it is quite
</p>
<p>outside all the issues on trial in the present case.
</p>
<p>Mr. James Perry affirmed, and examined by Mr. Whiteside.
</p>
<p>I am a member of the Society of Friends.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside.  What are the rules of the Society of Friends, in
</p>
<p>reference to arbitration?
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General.  I object to that question.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside.  Fsubmit we are entitled to show what their prac-
</p>
<p>tice is in reference to arbitration, and that the traversers merely
</p>
<p>adopted it, and to show by that fact that they had no intention to
</p>
<p>interfere with or subvert the Courts of Justice.
</p>
<p>The Attorney- General I entirely object to the rules of the
</p>
<p>Society of Friends being given in evidence, and I submit that they
</p>
<p>have no relation to the issue joined upon the charges in the present in-
</p>
<p>dictment.
</p>
<p>Mr. Macdonogh.  It is alleged that the parties have entered into
</p>
<p>certain rules with a certain intent and object. We rely on this as
</p>
<p>evidence that similar rules have been adopted by a most respectable
</p>
<p>class in the community, to show that the traversers acted with a simi-
</p>
<p>lar intention, and not with the object charged in the indictment.
</p>
<p>Serjeant Warren.  Both upon principle and authority this evi-
</p>
<p>dence is inadmissible. If these regulations are legal, they do not re-
</p>
<p>quire to be supported by the rules of any other body of men. If, on
</p>
<p>the other hand, those regulations are illegal in themselves, whether
</p>
<p>they have been followed by the Quakers or whether they have been
</p>
<p>derived from them, cannot affect the criminality or innocence of the

</p>
<p>traversers in their having adopted them. But it is said, that the
</p>
<p>Crown having permitted this to be stated, the objection now comes
</p>
<p>too late, we did not choose to interrupt counsel in his statement, for
</p>
<p>it is impracticable to abstain from stating something that may not be
</p>
<p>evidence, but may be considered as a fair line of argument to the
</p>
<p>jury. The same species of evidence was tendered by Mr. Erskine in
</p>
<p>Home Tooke's case, and was unanimously rejected by the Court.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  I am of opinion that this evidence
</p>
<p>is admissible. The indictment is to this effect, that the traversers
</p>
<p>conspired to bring into disrepute the Courts of Justice, as bylaw
</p>
<p>established in this country, by substituting other modes for the peo-
</p>
<p>ple to settle their differences, in derogation of the Queen's Courts.
</p>
<p>The animus and intention with which this was done, are the essence
</p>
<p>of the charge. The question is, whether this was done with a crimi-
</p>
<p>nal intent ; with the intent to bring the Courts into disrepute.
</p>
<p>Surely, to show quo aniino the act was done, it is material to show
</p>
<p>652
</p>
<p>that a vast number of the respectable portion of the community have
</p>
<p>done the same thing, and have universally been considered as acting
</p>
<p>legally. These rules were adopted by a most respectable class, and
</p>
<p>had never been impeached. Surely these are clearly evidence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton  My opinion does not coincide with my
</p>
<p>Lord Chief Justice, or with the opinions of the other members of this
</p>
<p>Court. This is a matter of principle, and I feel bound to state that
</p>
<p>I cannot acquiesce in the reasoning by which this evidence is made
</p>
<p>admissible. It is quite true the question is as to the intention of the
</p>
<p>traversers, and their object is to show that a criminal intention is
</p>
<p>erroneously imputed to them ; but I should apprehend that the in-
</p>
<p>tention with which parties do a particular act, is to be deduced from
</p>
<p>their own acts and declarations, and not from the acts and declara-
</p>
<p>tions of other persons. As it has been truly put by Sergeant War-
</p>
<p>ren, if their principles are just, fair, and legal, they arejust, fair, and
</p>
<p>legal to all classes of Her Majesty's subjects, and tliey do not require
</p>
<p>the support of any other body of men, however respectable or re-
</p>
<p>spected the body may be, if they are illegal ; the fact that the
</p>
<p>Quakers have adopted them cannot make them legal. The in-
</p>
<p>stitution of arbitration is in itself innocent and legal. No per-
</p>
<p>son ever thought of accusing the Quakers of having the inten-
</p>
<p>tion thereby to bring the Courts of Justice into discredit and disre-
</p>
<p>pute. That must be conceded. But the allegation here is, that the
</p>
<p>traversers have established and recommended those Arbitration
</p>
<p>Courts, but with a totally different intention from that of the Qua-
</p>
<p>kers. How then, can you estimate the intention of the traversers by
</p>
<p>the intentions of the Quakers? The acts themselves may be legal,
</p>
<p>but take the intention, and they may then become illegal. If you
</p>
<p>admit the acts of the Quakers, you may admit the acts of any other
</p>
<p>society ; but how can we judge of the intentions of the parties, from
</p>
<p>the acts of others ? The acts may be the same, but the intention
</p>
<p>can only be discovered from the acts of the parties themselves.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Burton.  I concur with my Lord Chief Justice ;
</p>
<p>I apprehend this is not a question of law for the Court to deter-

</p>
<p>mine, but a question of intention for the jury to decide. There is
</p>
<p>no doubt that, abstractedly speaking, to establish a mode of settling
</p>
<p>differences by arbitration, is not in itself illegal ; but the question
</p>
<p>here is, whether the mode proposed by the traversers for that pur-
</p>
<p>pose was adopted with the intention charged by the indictment, that
</p>
<p>is, to bring the Courts of Law into contempt ; and the traversers
</p>
<p>wish to prove that it was not adopted with that intent ; and for that
</p>
<p>purpose they seek to give in evidence the acts of the Society of
</p>
<p>Friends, who have established those Courts, for the purpose of having
</p>
<p>their differences settled without expense. They wish to show that
</p>
<p>the Arbitration Courts were instituted, not for the purpose of bring-
</p>
<p>ing the Courts in disrepute, but merely to settle differences and dis-
</p>
<p>putes, by following out the mode which has been practised by others.
</p>
<p>That is a question for the jury.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrint  I concur in opinion with my Lord
</p>
<p>Chief Justice, and my brother Burton. The charge against the tra-
</p>
<p>versers is, that they intended by the establishment of those Arbitra-
</p>
<p>053
</p>
<p>tion Courts, to bring the established Courts of Law into disrepute.
</p>
<p>Surely, it is a matter of inquiry for the jury, and most material for
</p>
<p>them to know, that a respectable body of Her Majesty's subjects
</p>
<p>have published rules, having the same tendency as the Arbitration
</p>
<p>Courts. This, as evidence, does not conclude the question, but it is
</p>
<p>a very important and material inquiry, as to what the intent of the
</p>
<p>traversers was, and in this respect the rules of the Quakers and of
</p>
<p>the Ouzel Galley are clearly evidence. It is powerful to go to the
</p>
<p>jury to show that their course of proceeding does not necessarily
</p>
<p>involve a criminal intent.
</p>
<p>The Witness then read the following rules of the Society of
</p>
<p>Friends with respect to arbitration :
</p>
<p>" Advised, that all Friends do keep out of differences ; that one
</p>
<p>" Friend go not to law with another. And it being considered in
</p>
<p>" this meeting, that it is inconvenient and of bad consequences for
</p>
<p>" Friends to be forward in going to law ;
</p>
<p>" Advised, that all Friends be careful to avoid as much as may
</p>
<p>" be going to law, and endeavour to live at peace with all men ; for
</p>
<p>" we are all called to peace, and to be a peaceable people.  D.
</p>
<p> 1677, 1687, 1807.
</p>
<p>" Advised, that no Friends shall go from the order of truth ;
</p>
<p>" and former advice not to sue one another at law, but that all dif-
</p>
<p>M ferences among friends be speedily ended by themselves, or by re-
</p>
<p>" ference, and not prolonged or delayed  L. 1690.
</p>
<p>" Friends are desired to be zealously and heartily concerned to put
</p>
<p>" a speedy end to differences that may happen between any Friends ;
</p>
<p>" and that when any disagreement is determined, the persons con-
</p>
<p>" cemed do quietly submit thereto, without showing discontent, or
</p>
<p>" using any reflections or unseemly expressions, either against the
</p>
<p>" Arbitrators, or person or persons with whom the difference had
</p>
<p>11 been ; and that all other Friends forbear raising unnecessary dis-
</p>
<p>" courses thereon, whereby to endeavour to bring Friends into a
</p>
<p>" liking or disliking of the case, either on the one hand or the other,
</p>
<p>" and thereby make parties either while the matter is before the Ar-

<p>" bitrators or afterwards; but rather that all should endeavour to
</p>
<p>" promote love and peace D. 1720.
</p>
<p>" Let Friends everywhere be careful that all differences about
</p>
<p>" outward things be speedily composed between themselves or by ar-
</p>
<p>" bitrators, without troubling monthly or quarterly meetings with such
</p>
<p>" affairs ; and it would be well that Friends were at all times ready
</p>
<p>" to submit their differences, even with persons not of our religious
</p>
<p>" persuasion, to arbitration, rather than contend at law. Hear the
</p>
<p>" causes between your brethren, and judge righteous between every
</p>
<p>" man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.  L. 1737,
</p>
<p>" 1833.
</p>
<p>" Whereas it sometimes happeneth, to the hurt of truth and grief
</p>
<p>" of many Friends, that differences do arise among some professing
</p>
<p>" truth, about outward things ; it is therefore by this meeting thought
</p>
<p>" inconvenient, and advised, when any Friends shall hear of any such
</p>
<p>" difference betwixt any Friends, to which they belong, that they
</p>
<p>il forthwith speak to and tenderly advise the personsbetweenwhom the
</p>
<p>654
</p>
<p>H difference is, to make a speedy end thereof; and if such Friend do
</p>
<p>" not comply with their advice, that then they take to them one or two
</p>
<p>" Friends more and again exhort them to end their differences ; and if
</p>
<p>" they or either of them refuse, then to let them know that it is the ad-
</p>
<p>' vice and counsel of Friends, that they should each choose an equal
</p>
<p>" number of indifferent, impartial, and judicious Friends, to hear and
</p>
<p>" speedily determine the same; and that they do bind themselves to
</p>
<p>" stand to their award and determination, or the award and deter-
</p>
<p>" mination of the major part of them, that shall be made and signed
</p>
<p>" by the umpire, if there be one agreed unto. Also that this meeting
</p>
<p>" doth advise that if any Friend shall refuse speedily to end their
</p>
<p>" differences, or refer it, as before advised, complaint be made of that
</p>
<p>" person unto the monthly meeting to which he doth belong; and
</p>
<p>f* if, after admonition, he shall refuse to so refer his case, that the
</p>
<p>" meeting do testify against such person, and disown him to be of our
</p>
<p>" Society. And if any Friends that shall be advised to hear and
</p>
<p>" determine any such difference as aforesaid, after they have accepted
</p>
<p>" thereof, and the parties differing are become bound to stand to their
</p>
<p>" determination, shall decline and refuse to stand and act as Arbitra-
</p>
<p>" tors, that then the person or persons so refusing be required to give
</p>
<p>" the reason of their refusal unto the monthly meeting unto which they
</p>
<p>" belong ; and if that meeting shall not esteem those reasons sufficient
</p>
<p>" justly to excuse them, then the meeting is to press them to stand
</p>
<p>" to what they have accepted ; and if after such admonition they shall
</p>
<p>" continue to refuse to stand as Arbitrators, that the meeting do tes-
</p>
<p>" tify against them, or either of them, as such as are not subject to the
</p>
<p>" just rules of our Society, neither ought to be admitted thereunto,
</p>
<p>" until he or they condemn orretract the same. And it is the advice
</p>
<p>" of this meeting that persons differing about outward things do, as
</p>
<p>" little as may be, trouble ministering Friends with being Arbitrators
</p>
<p>" in such cases. And that all persons differing be exhorted by the
</p>
<p>" monthly meeting to which they belong, when their cases are re-
</p>
<p>" ferred, and judgment and award made, signed, and given to the
</p>
<p>" persons as aforesaid, to stand to and perform the said award which

<p>" they have bound themselves to perform ; and if any one shall refuse
</p>
<p>" so to do, that then the monthly meeting to which such person may
</p>
<p>' belong, upon notice thereof to them given, shall admonish him
</p>
<p> thereunto ; and if after admonition they refuse, then the meeting do
</p>
<p>" testify against them 1657. It is the sense and judgment of this
</p>
<p>" meeting, that if any member of our religious society shall arrest,
</p>
<p>" sue, or implead at law any other member of our religious society,
</p>
<p>" before he hath proceeded in the way herein before recommended,
</p>
<p>" such person doth therein depart from the principle of truth, the known
</p>
<p>" way thereof, and acts contrary thereunto, and ought to be dealt with
</p>
<p>" by the meeting he belongs to for the same ; and if he shall not give
</p>
<p>" satisfaction to the meeting for such his disorderly proceeding by con-
</p>

</p>
<p>" party so sued or arrested, taking with him, or, if under confinement,
</p>
<p>" sending one or two Friends to the person who goes to law, shall com-
</p>
<p> plain thereof, the said person shall be required immediately to stay
</p>
<p>i< proceedings, and if he does not comply with such requisition, the
</p>
<p>655
</p>
<p>" monthly meeting to which he belongs shall disown him if the case

</p>
<p>Examination resumed.  These rules, as far I know, have been
</p>
<p>uniformly acted upon. I have no recollection of any instance of those
</p>
<p>who disobeyed them having been expelled ; but persons who disobeyed
</p>
<p>them would be expelled. I am not a member of the Ouzel Galley ;
</p>
<p>but I have been a party to an arbitration there. I saw Mr. Brewster
</p>
<p>there once.
</p>
<p>William Cosgrave sworn, and examined by Mr. Macdonogh.
</p>
<p>I am connected with the Ouzel Galley. I am Secretary and Re-
</p>
<p>gistrar of it. I have been acting in that capacity since 1810. I
</p>
<p>have been present at almost all the arbitrations which have taken
</p>
<p>place since that time. The parties called on me and named arbi-
</p>
<p>trators, then I handed them a printed deed of submission and they
</p>
<p>signed it. These proceedings are taken pursuant to the rules of the
</p>
<p>Society. The Society, when it is full, consists of forty persons.
</p>
<p>Sometimes there are not so many, but it is filled up as soon as pos-
</p>
<p>sible. When claims are referred to the Society the party claiming
</p>
<p>generally names the arbitrators. The names of the gentlemen who
</p>
<p>now compose the Society are, Thomas Crosthvvaite, Arthur Guinness,
</p>
<p>James Charles, Thomas Watson, William W. Colville, John Hone,
</p>
<p>Thomas Maxwell, George Law, Henry Wilson, S. Boileau, William
</p>
<p>Fortescue, Esqrs. When parties come to have arbitration they are
</p>
<p>required to lodge four guineas each to pay the expenses of the arbi-
</p>
<p>tration, and then the case is settled by the Arbitrators. The deed
</p>
<p>of submission is signed by the parties that it may be binding, and
</p>
<p>confirmed in the Court.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bennett.
</p>
<p>It is to those that choose to refer their differences to the Society
</p>
<p>that the arbitration is granted. It is open to any person, and strangers
</p>
<p>may refer their differences to it. It is a part of the deed of submis-
</p>
<p>sion that it should be made a rule of Court. The parties referring to
</p>
<p>Arbitrators, name their own days for holding their arbitration.

<p>tors themselves out of the number of the Society. I don't believe the
</p>
<p>Society is incorporated by any Charter or Act of Parliament ; but it is
</p>
<p>a very old Society.
</p>
<p>Mr. Charles Vernon sworn, and examined by Mr. Fitz-
</p>
<p>gibbon.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon called on Mr. Vernon to produce the Morning Re-
</p>
<p>gister of September 14, 1841. Mr. Vernon produced the paper.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon.  I have no desire to have read the whole of a
</p>
<p>speech delivered by Mr. O'Connell, which was reported in this paper.
</p>
<p>I only require a portion of it to be read.
</p>
<p>The Attorney -General.  I do not know how this paper, the
</p>
<p>Morning Register, can be made evidence for the traverseis.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon.  The published opinions of Mr. O'Connell, on the
</p>
<p>656
</p>
<p>Repeal of the Union, are contained in that paper, and those opinions
</p>
<p>are in issue.
</p>
<p>The Attorney -General.  The Morning Register is a daily paper,
</p>
<p>and there is no daily paper ordered to be circulated by the Repeal As-
</p>
<p>sociation. They only circulated weekly papers.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Burton.  Is it a paper which is circulated by the
</p>
<p>Association ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  No, my Lord ; but in that paper there is a
</p>
<p>speech of Mr. O'Connell's on the Repeal of the Union, which we are
</p>
<p>entitled to read in evidence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton. Unless you can prove this speech
</p>
<p>was spoken by Mr. O'Connell I do not see how you can make it evi-
</p>
<p>dence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Vernon then produced the Freeman's Journal, 7th Septem-
</p>
<p>ber, 1841.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General.  I object to this being given in evidence
</p>
<p>on the part of the traversers. We did not object to their reading any-
</p>
<p>thing the traversers said in 1843; but they now propose to read a
</p>
<p>speech of Mr. O'Connell's made in 1841. The proper evidence of
</p>
<p>this must be the person who heard the speech. It is clear that the
</p>
<p>person who reported the speech must have been present when it was
</p>
<p>delivered, and he is not produced, nor his absence accounted for.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon.  Dr. Gray was the proprietor of this paper, and
</p>
<p>has published those proceedings ; it is, therefore, an act of his. One
</p>
<p>of the overt acts of conspiracy is, that he published seditious and in-
</p>
<p>flammatory speeches made at the Association. Now I wish to show
</p>
<p>that he published speeches not calculated to inflame, but which had
</p>
<p>quite a contrary tendency.
</p>
<p>Mr. Sheil.  In Home Tooke's case, a book written by him twelve
</p>
<p>years before the prosecution was admitted in evidence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Macdonogh.  The course taken when a similar objection
</p>
<p>was made in Cobbett's case, will govern the present case. Cobbett
</p>
<p>was tried in 1831 for the publication of a libel in a paper called
</p>
<p>Cobbett's Political Register, of which he was the editor and proprietor,

</p>
<p>and on his trial he proposed to read in his defence matter published
</p>
<p>by him in the year 1822. The Attorney-General objected that the
</p>
<p>article was of too remote a date, and Lord Tenterden was about to
</p>
<p>allow the objection, when Mr. Cobbett referred to Home Tooke's
</p>
<p>case, and its admissibility was ruled in his favour by the Court.
</p>
<p>Sergeant. Warren The counsel for the traversers are going on
</p>
<p>the assumption that this paper has been published by Dr. Gray, but
</p>
<p>they have not yet proved the fact.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon.  When did Dr. Gray become proprietor of the
</p>
<p>Freeman's Journal ? On the 8th of February, 1841. This news-
</p>
<p>paper which I produce, is one of the newspapers sent according to
</p>
<p>the Statute to the Stamp-office, and was signed by the printer.
</p>
<p>Sergeant Warren The Stamp Act has pointed out and pro-
</p>
<p>vided for the production of express legal proof as against the pub-
</p>
<p>lisher, by lodgment of a paper in a certain way, and it provides
</p>
<p>657
</p>
<p>expressly that the defendant could not resort to the statutory proof
</p>
<p>in his own favour or behalf. In the case of JVatts v. Frazer, 7 Ad.
</p>
<p>& Ell. 223, there was an action brought against the proprietor of a
</p>
<p>newspaper. The party on trial wished to read some matters in other
</p>
<p>papers besides those put in evidence against him, and to give the
</p>
<p>statutory proof of it, but the Court decided against the application,
</p>
<p>and decided that he should prove them in the ordinary way. In the
</p>
<p>present case let the traversers bring forward the persons who had
</p>
<p>reported those speeches, and who having heard them, could of course
</p>
<p>prove them.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin.  The Crown has already given evidence
</p>
<p>of this gentleman being the proprietor of the Freeman, both before
</p>
<p>and after the date of the publication they wanted to use.
</p>
<p>Sergeant Warren That would be unanswerable if the traver-
</p>
<p>sers had not better evidence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Macdonogh.  The case of Watts v. Frazer has no bearing
</p>
<p>in the present case. In that case the defendant wanted in mitigation
</p>
<p>to show that the plaintiff had published a libel previously which had
</p>
<p>the effect of provoking. In order to prove it, he proposed to offer
</p>
<p>the statutory proof by producing the newspaper from the Stamp
</p>
<p>Office containing it, but the Court held that was no proof of publi-
</p>
<p>cation, for non constat that any other paper had been issued.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  I am of opinion this evidence
</p>
<p>should be admitted.
</p>
<p>Mr. Vernon then read from the Freeman's Journal of the 5th
</p>
<p>October, 1841, a speech of Mr. O'Connell, delivered at the Repeal
</p>
<p>Association, condemnatory of the means resorted to by the Americans
</p>
<p>to obtain their independence ; and pledging the people of Ireland to
</p>
<p>use only peaceable means to effect their objects. Another speech of
</p>
<p>his made on the same occasion strongly censuring the Chartists and
</p>
<p>their proceedings was also read, and given in evidence.
</p>
<p>The Pilot of the 15th April, 1840, was then handed to the Clerk
</p>
<p>of the Crown, who read therefrom " The Plan of the National Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation of Ireland for full and prompt Justice, or Repeal."

<p>The Officer, by Mr. Macdonogh's directions, read Mr. O'Connell's
</p>
<p>letter to Mr. Tyler, son of the President of the United States, as
</p>
<p>published in the Pilot of the 12th of April, 1843. He also read ex-
</p>
<p>tracts from the Pilot of the 15th of April, 1843.
</p>
<p>The following documents were then read : 
</p>
<p>Report of the Repeal Association, dedicated to Ireland.
</p>
<p>Report of the Committee of Arbitration.
</p>
<p>Report of the Loyal National Repeal Association on the state of
</p>
<p>the Franchise, April 27, 1840.
</p>
<p>The Report of a Committee of the Loyal National Repeal Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation on the Means to be adopted for the Re-construction of the
</p>
<p>Irish House of Commons.
</p>
<p>Report on the Financial Injustice inflicted on Ireland by the
</p>
<p>Union, signed by Daniel O'Connell.
</p>
<p>The Officer next read a pamphlet, entitled, " Series of Reports
</p>
<p>of the Loval National Repeal Association of Ireland," containing
</p>
<p>4p
</p>
<p>658
</p>
<p>a report of the resolutions passed at the period of the Union against
</p>
<p>that measure, published in 1843, and printed by J. Browne, 36, Nas-
</p>
<p>sau-street ; and on the distressing effects of the Union as felt in the
</p>
<p>cotton, silk, and other manufactures of Ireland.
</p>
<p>Report of the Committee of the National Repeal Association on
</p>
<p>the number of Representatives for Ireland.
</p>
<p>Report on the means by which the Union was carried.
</p>
<p>William Morgan sworn, and examined by Mr. Hatchell.
</p>
<p>I live in Tullamore, and am a coachmaker by trade. I remem-
</p>
<p>ber the Repeal meeting which took place on the 16th July in that
</p>
<p>town. I know where a Mr. Deane lives. A Mr. Hand lives on the
</p>
<p>opposite side of the street. I recollect about ten o'clock in the
</p>
<p>morning seeing an arch stretching across the street, from the house
</p>
<p>of Deane and that of Hand. There was written on it : Ireland,
</p>
<p>her Parliament, or the World in a Blaze. I afterwards assisted
</p>
<p>in taking it down. It was taken down by Mr. Steele's orders. Mr.
</p>
<p>Steele came to Deane's house and desired him to remove it imme-
</p>
<p>diately. Deane at first hesitated, and asked him by what authority
</p>
<p>he desired him to take it down. Mr. Steele said by Mr. O'Connell's
</p>
<p>express directions, who was much displeased at its.havingbeen put up.
</p>
<p>It was taken down at a quarter before eleven, after second mass.
</p>
<p>The meeting took place at two o'clock.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Brewster.
</p>
<p>I attended the meeting. I do not know that there was a com-
</p>
<p>mittee formed to get up the meeting, but heard there was. I did
</p>
<p>not subscribe. Deane is a painter, and assisted to take down the
</p>
<p>arch. It was opposite to one of the entrances to the chapel, but not
</p>
<p>to the principal one. There was a large attendance at the chapel
</p>
<p>that day. I did not see any of the processions coming into the
</p>
<p>town. Deane is in town, and came up with me as a witness who
</p>
<p>was to be examined.
</p>
<p>The resolutions proposed at the meetings at Mullingar, Longford,
</p>
<p>Drogheda and Tara, that petitions for a Repeal of the Union should
</p>
<p>be presented, were then proved in evidence. The requisition con-

</p>
<p>cerning the Loughrea meeting was also put in and read.
</p>
<p>Mr. Vernon was recalled, and read from the Freeman's Journal
</p>
<p>of the 27th of October, 1841, the report of the proceedings at a
</p>
<p>meeting of the Repeal Association, at which Mr. O'Connell moved
</p>
<p>that certain communications from Quebec be inserted on the minutes;
</p>
<p>and, in doing so, observed that that was the time to let their Canadian
</p>
<p>friends know that there was no difficulty in enrolling them as Mem-
</p>
<p>bers andVolunteers, as they were British subjects. In the same speech
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell deprecated the system of physical force which had been
</p>
<p>resorted to by the people of Lower Canada ; and stated that in Ire-
</p>
<p>land, the struggle for liberty and right should be a peaceable and
</p>
<p>constitutional one.
</p>
<p>The Witness next read, from the Freeman's Journal of the 5th
</p>
<p>of April, 1842, a report of a speech made by Mr. O'Connell at the
</p>
<p>659
</p>
<p>Association, in which he stated his desire to join with any party in
</p>
<p>endeavouring to obtain reform measures, at the same time denouncing
</p>
<p>the course that was being pursued by the Chartists in England.
</p>
<p>He next read the reports of speeches delivered by Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>when Lord Mayor, published in the Freeman's Journal of the 6th of
</p>
<p>January, 1842, the 25th of March, 1842, and the 11th of May, 1842;
</p>
<p>also the report of a speech of Mr. O'Connell, in which he stated that
</p>
<p>Her Majesty had the power to restore the Parliament, and warned
</p>
<p>the people not to enter into any secret societies, but keep clear of the
</p>
<p>villains who were only employed for their destruction.
</p>
<p>Mr. Vernon next proved the Freeman's Journals of the 1 7th,
</p>
<p>23rd, 24th, and 25th of May, and 16th of August, 1842, and 14th
</p>
<p>of September, 1841, from which he read speeches delivered by Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell at the Repeal Association, and at meetings for the promo-
</p>
<p>tion of Irish manufacture, in which he spoke of the decline of trade
</p>
<p>owing to the Union, called on the people to obey the laws and pre-
</p>
<p>serve the peace, and expressed his devoted attachment and allegiance
</p>
<p>to the Queen.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  I am of opinion that this evidence
</p>
<p>should be admitted.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon.  Your Lordships may remember that I and
</p>
<p>the other counsel for the traversers, in the course of our state-
</p>
<p>ments, adverted to the evidence of the Rev. Mr. Power, whom
</p>
<p>we intended to examine. He was served with a Crown summons
</p>
<p>to attend, and is now actually on the road to Dublin; but in
</p>
<p>consequence of the very bad state of health in which he was, his
</p>
<p>physician could with difficulty be persuaded to allow him to travel at
</p>
<p>all, and gave strict directions that the journey should be performed
</p>
<p>by easy stages. He will be in attendance to-morrow at two o'clock,
</p>
<p>and under those circumstances it is hoped that the Court will not ob-
</p>
<p>ject to the postponement of the case until that hour. Let the Court
</p>
<p>intimate whatever course will be most convenient, we cannot have
</p>
<p>the witness here until to-morrow about two o'clock. The case may
</p>
<p>be adjourned until that hour, or, let the Witness be examined at the

<p>sitting of the Court next morning.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  Have you done with every thing else?
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon.  Yes, my Lord. We might protract this trial
</p>
<p>to any hour; but we do not wish to take up the public time unne-
</p>
<p>cessarily, or to occupy that of your Lordships, by reading documents
</p>
<p>we do not think necessary to be read. There is nothing else which
</p>
<p>we are desirous of reading, and no other fact necessary to prove but
</p>
<p>that respecting the letter signed by Mr. Power, and entitled " The
</p>
<p>Duty of a Soldier." Let the Solicitor General refrain from making
</p>
<p>any observations upon that letter, and let it be put out of the case
</p>
<p>until Mr. Power has been examined, and given his explanation to the
</p>
<p>Court and to the jury ; or will the Solicitor General undertake that
</p>
<p>no observations be made upon the case, because he is not produced ?
</p>
<p>The Solicitor General.  I do not intend to make any observa-
</p>
<p>tions on his not being produced.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon.  We think his evidence would completely ex-
</p>
<p>660
</p>
<p>culpate the traversers from the charge sought to be deduced from
</p>
<p>that letter.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice You had better prove the service
</p>
<p>of the subpoena.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitsgibbon.  We are prepared to prove that.
</p>
<p>Patrick Gaynor sworn, and examined by Mr. Monahan.
</p>
<p>I am in the employment of Mr. Mahony. I am a clerk. I
</p>
<p>served a subpoena on the Rev. Richard Power, on Saturday last. He
</p>
<p>was then in apparently a very weak state. He said he was entirely
</p>
<p>in the hands of his physician, and would come to town if he desired
</p>
<p>him. I saw his physician the next day. We all met at Mr. Barron's,
</p>
<p>on Sunday last, and after a good deal of conversation between Mr.
</p>
<p>Barron and the physician, the latter said that Mr. Power might travel
</p>
<p>to Dublin by slow stages. He and Mr. Barron were to travel to-
</p>
<p>gether, and they were to be in town on Wednesday. Mr. Power
</p>
<p>resides at Kilrossenty, near Dungarvan. He said he could not come
</p>
<p>sooner on account of his illness.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Freeman.
</p>
<p>I got directions from Mr. Mahony to serve a subpoena on Mr.
</p>
<p>Power, on Friday evening last, about five or six o'clock. I arrived
</p>
<p>at Waterford on Saturday morning. I was at Kilrossenty about five
</p>
<p>o'clock the same evening. Mr. Power was in his own parlour, and
</p>
<p>his curate, the Rev. Mr. Casey, was with him. They had dined. I
</p>
<p>saw nothing particular on the table at first, but Mr. Power afterwards
</p>
<p>asked me to take some dinner and a glass of wine. He sent his girl
</p>
<p>for it. He gave me one glass, and took one himself.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell.  Having examined this Witness to account for our
</p>
<p>not being able to produce Mr. Power, we trust the Crown will not
</p>
<p>make any comments arising from his not being examined.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor- General.  I do not mean to comment on his ab-
</p>
<p>sence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell.  But will you promise not to comment on the do-
</p>
<p>cument itself.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor- General.  I can make no such promise ; and as

</p>
<p>to accounting for the absence of the Witness, surely he ought to
</p>
<p>have been served with a subpoena before Saturday when the trial
</p>
<p>had been going on for three weeks.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside.  A letter was sent to the gentleman before, re-
</p>
<p>quiring his attendance.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon submitted that the Solicitor-General ought not
</p>
<p>to make any observations upon the letter, purporting to be signed by
</p>
<p>Mr. Power, until after that gentleman had been examined. He
</p>
<p>would have sufficient materials to occupy the Court during more
</p>
<p>than one day, and therefore why comment on that particular docu-
</p>
<p>ment ?
</p>
<p>The Solicitor -General.  I shall not make any observations on
</p>
<p>the case until the evidence I am called on to answer is closed ; at the
</p>
<p>same time, I undertake not to make any observations upon the non-
</p>
<p>661
</p>
<p>production of Mr. Power, and I assume they had satisfactory reasons
</p>
<p>for not producing him.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  His testimony would take away the effect of
</p>
<p>that letter.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  We think that the Solicitor-General
</p>
<p>should not be called upon to make his statement until he is satisfied,
</p>
<p>that no undue interruption would take place, and we do not mean to
</p>
<p>impose on him any course to adopt which he does not think right.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore.  We do not press to have Mr. Power examined, and
</p>
<p>we close on the part of the traversers.
</p>
<p>WEDNESDAY, February 7th.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General.
</p>
<p>May it please your Lordships, and Gentlemen of the Jury,
</p>
<p>At length it has become my duty to address you upon the evi-
</p>
<p>dence which you have heard in this case, and never perhaps did one
</p>
<p>more arduous devolve upon a law officer of the Crown. The mo-
</p>
<p>mentous importance of this trial  the vast variety of topics that have
</p>
<p>been introduced into it  the talent, the eloquence, the ingenuity
</p>
<p>of the host of counsel against whom I am now called on single-
</p>
<p>handed to contend  the consequences of your verdict as affecting
</p>
<p>the law of the land, and the peace, tranquillity, and I may add, the hap-
</p>
<p>piness of this country  all these considerations may well appal even a
</p>
<p>person of much greater confidence in his powers, both of mind and
</p>
<p>body, than I possess, when called on to discharge so formidable a
</p>
<p>task. It is, therefore, with no small share of anxiety and appre-
</p>
<p>hension, I approach the execution of this important duty. Great,
</p>
<p>however, as is my sense of the responsibility attached to it, yet
</p>
<p>there is a still greater one, I mean your's, Gentlemen of the Jury.
</p>
<p>You have sworn, by the most solemn of all obligations, to find a
</p>
<p>verdict according to the evidence, unaffected by prejudice, political,
</p>
<p>sectarian, or religious  unaffected by fear, favour, or affection ; unin-
</p>
<p>fluenced by any other consideration than the truth and justice of the
</p>
<p>case. That you feel to the fullest extent the responsibility imposed
</p>
<p>upon you, the close attention you have paid to the progress of this

</p>
<p>trial abundantly proves, and it is my conviction of this which em-
</p>
<p>boldens me to expect a little further indulgence from that patience
</p>
<p>which already has been so severely taxed. I despair of enlivening
</p>
<p>the case by any ebullition of wit, fancy, or eloquence. I am not
</p>
<p>gifted with the powers which belong to my learned friends, and if I
</p>
<p>were, I should not feel myself justified in resorting to them in order
</p>
<p>to influence your judgment. I ask a verdict from you, not by ap-
</p>
<p>pealing to your passions, or your prepossessions and prejudices ; but
</p>
<p>by calling upon you as honest men, to exercise a sound judgment,
</p>
<p>and if you cannot give a verdict of guilty upon a fair exercise of that
</p>
<p>judgment, I do not ask it at your hands. But before I have con-
</p>
<p>cluded, I think I shall present the case to ynu in such a light, as will
</p>
<p>relieve you from the slightest possible difficulty as to the course you
</p>
<p>ought to pursue, and will vindicate the verdict, which I confidently
</p>
<p>G62
</p>
<p>anticipate from you, in the eyes of every honest and fair man in the
</p>
<p>country. Our's, Gentlemen, is a plain, straightforward, just cause ; it
</p>
<p>needs nothing but the exercise ofa sound judgment and an honest heart
</p>
<p>to arrive at a proper conclusion with regard to it. There has, how-
</p>
<p>ever, been so much misrepresentation, both in point of law and fact,
</p>
<p>so many irrelevant and extraneous topics have been introduced, so
</p>
<p>much obscurity and confusion have been heaped upon the case by the
</p>
<p>ingenuity, learning, and talent of the counsel for the traversers, that
</p>
<p>before I can hope to make the case intelligible, it will be necessary
</p>
<p>to divest it of all the topics which I may say do not properly belong
</p>
<p>to it, and which cannot have been introduced for any other reason
</p>
<p>than to divert your attention from the real question which you have
</p>
<p>to try.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you have heard eight addresses by different counsel
</p>
<p>on the part of the several traversers. Many of those gentlemen
</p>
<p>introduced matter not only different, but inconsistent. In one
</p>
<p>respect, however, there is a marvellous coincidence in all, that is the
</p>
<p>total absence of any the slightest comment upon, or any the least
</p>
<p>reference to, the evidence in the case. Not a single observation
</p>
<p>has been addressed to the real matters in question. Before, how-
</p>
<p>ever, I apply myself to the details of the case as proved by the
</p>
<p>Crown, it is necessary that I should advert as briefly as possible
</p>
<p>to these topics which have been thus introduced, and I think you
</p>
<p>will say that they have not the slightest bearing upon the case,
</p>
<p>and that they have been introduced for no other reason than from
</p>
<p>the necessity which lay upon the defendants to evade touching
</p>
<p>the question which you have sworn to investigate, namely, the exis-
</p>
<p>tence or non-existence of this conspiracy with which they have been
</p>
<p>charged. My learned friend, Mr. Sheil, who has not often favoured
</p>
<p>us lately by appearing in those Courts to delight us with his splendid
</p>
<p>eloquence, his visits being, like angels' visits, very few and far between.
</p>
<p>This, however, was conceived to be an occasion where it was neces-
</p>
<p>sary to resort to something extraordinary. He appeared as counsel
</p>
<p>for Mr. John O'Connell ; and I was certainly delighted by the most

</p>
<p>splendid exhibition of eloquence I have ever heard.
</p>
<p>" Materiam superabat opus."
</p>
<p>The execution was brilliant and elaborate; but the matter was
</p>
<p>meagre indeed. In fact he threw his client overboard, as his client
</p>
<p>appeared to consider, for he disclaimed, in a great measure, the line
</p>
<p>of defence his counsel had taken. Am I not, Gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>Jury, justified in saying, that from the beginning to the end of his
</p>
<p>address, there is not a single explanation or denial of any one fact,
</p>
<p>proved on the part of the Crown, as involving the case of his client.
</p>
<p>Do you recollect Mr. Shed's promise ? " I will now show you that my
</p>
<p>client is innocent of this charge." Now, I would ask you, Gentlemen
</p>
<p>of the Jury, can you point out one single fact relied on byldm, or any
</p>
<p>observation made by Mr. Sheil tending to show the innocence of his
</p>
<p>client in this case. There were topics of general interest brought for-
</p>
<p>ward by him, not at all bearing upon the case. The first was an attack
</p>
<p>on the Crown for allowing such a length of time to elapse before insti-
</p>
<p>663
</p>
<p>tilting this prosecution. Gentlemen, I must say that struck me as a
</p>
<p>most singular species of defence, because it involves something like an
</p>
<p>admission of the guilt of those parties, for what does it come to?
</p>
<p>" You suffered us to go on ; you enticed us into crime." My learned
</p>
<p>friend the Attorney-General was called by Mr. Sheil, " the artful
</p>
<p>dodger of the State," and compared to " the delator of Roman Em-
</p>
<p>pire," which comes to this, that the Crown or Government had actu-
</p>
<p>ally seduced these people into the commission of crime, and after they
</p>
<p>had suffered them to go on from day to day, from week to week, they
</p>
<p>then come down upon them and say they have violated the law. Is it
</p>
<p>not monstrous to set up such an allegation as this, on the question of
</p>
<p>the guilt or innocence of the traversers. If they have not violated the
</p>
<p>law they must be acquitted ; but if they have violated the law, what
</p>
<p>sort of a defence is it to say, that the Government, by their forbear-
</p>
<p>ance to prosecute, can affect the guilt of the parties ? I merely make
</p>
<p>these observations at present, because by-and by I mean to account
</p>
<p>for it, and I shall demonstrate to you, and [ hope to the public, that
</p>
<p>there has been no connivance on the part of the Government, or se-
</p>
<p>ducing into crime, but, on the contrary, that every warning was held
</p>
<p>out to them, and that this prosecution, which they had reason to ex-
</p>
<p>pect, could not have been brought forward with effect at an earlier
</p>
<p>period.
</p>
<p>But before I proceed further to the topics which Mr. Sheil has
</p>
<p>introduced, I think it right to disabuse your minds of the impression
</p>
<p>which it has been sedulously attempted to make on you with regard
</p>
<p>to what the Crown is prosecuting for. Gentlemen, you have heard
</p>
<p>over and over again that this was an indictment against the people of
</p>
<p>Ireland for the purpose of putting down free discussion, of extin-
</p>
<p>guishing their right of petitioning, and introducing an arbitrary con-
</p>
<p>trol over their legal rights. You have heard this over and over again
</p>
<p>repeated usque ad nauseam. Allow me to say, that this is not a
</p>
<p>prosecution against the people of Ireland, to prevent them from ex-
</p>
<p>ercising their legal rights. It is not a prosecution against any of
</p>
<p>those deluded people, who attended those meetings at the instance

</p>
<p>of the traversers ; they are not the persons prosecuted. It would
</p>
<p>have been more fair, more just, more true, to say that this is a pro-
</p>
<p>secution on behalf of those unfortunate people. It is my firm con-
</p>
<p>viction and persuasion, that your verdict will have the effect of stop-
</p>
<p>ping the proceedings to which they have become victims, and will
</p>
<p>turn to their amelioration in every respect. But it is then said we
</p>
<p>are prosecuting to put an end to free discussion. We are not prose-
</p>
<p>cuting any particular political or religious opinions. I admit that
</p>
<p>every one of the traversers had the fullest right to express his opi-
</p>
<p>nions upon any public subject whatever ; nay, more, to use his best
</p>
<p>exertions to propagate those opinions, and to have them entertained,
</p>
<p>as far as possible, by all persons in the community, and to use all le-
</p>
<p>gitimate means to accomplish that end ; but I deny the right of any
</p>
<p>person to attempt to bring about that object by the means charged
</p>
<p>in this indictment, to which I shall more particularly call your atten-
</p>
<p>tion in the course of my address. Now, Gentlemen, is this a prose-
</p>
<p>cution against the liberty of the Press ? It is true that there are in-
</p>
<p>664
</p>
<p>volved in this indictmer.,, three gentlemen who are the proprietors
</p>
<p>of newspapers, but they are not included in this indictment as the
</p>
<p>proprietors of these newspapers, but as conspirators. I deny the
</p>
<p>imputation that this is a prosecution against, the Press ; if it was,
</p>
<p>why were not the editors of other Liberal papers included in this
</p>
<p>prosecution ? you all know that papers in Dublin and in the country
</p>
<p>parts of Ireland, advocate the same views, namely, a Repeal of
</p>
<p>the Union, but they are not included in the indictment; why?
</p>
<p>because they have not become the agents and instruments for
</p>
<p>carrying out the designs which I shall have hereafter more par-
</p>
<p>ticularly to call your attention to. Your verdict in this case will
</p>
<p>not interfere with the liberty of the Press, nor with the exercise
</p>
<p>of any other constitutional right. Nor are we prosecuting for
</p>
<p>any breach or disturbance of the peace, though you might have sup-
</p>
<p>posed, from what has been said by the counsel for the traversers,
</p>
<p>that that was the nature of the charge. No. The charge is this : 
</p>
<p> That Mr. O'Connell, Dr. Gray, Mr. Duffy, Mr. Barrett, and the
</p>
<p>" other traversers, have entered into an illegal confederacy, for the
</p>
<p>" purpose of effecting changes in the Constitution of this country, by
</p>
<p>" other than constitutional means." That is what the law calls a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. Gentlemen, I believe every one of the counsel who addressed
</p>
<p>you on behalf of the traversers, over and over again, stated, that the
</p>
<p>offence of conspiracy necessarily implies secrecy ; and I do not doubt
</p>
<p>but that some persons are under the impression, from the reiteration
</p>
<p>of this assertion, that no person can, in point of law, be guilty of a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, unless it be proved that they had retired to some dark place,
</p>
<p>to some secret cavern, there to concoct their schemes. In a popular
</p>
<p>sense, conspiracy may imply secrecy, because it seldom happens that
</p>
<p>persons enter into a design of that kind publicly ; but, in point of law,
</p>
<p>a conspiracy may be as public as any other offence which is the sub-
</p>
<p>ject of prosecution under our law. Suppose a number of tradesmen
</p>
<p>publicly meet, and enter into resolutions that they will allow no man
</p>
<p>to work under a certain sum, and if he presumes to do so, he will be
</p>
<p>subject to a penalty. That would be open and public ; but could it

</p>
<p>therefore be contended for a moment, that it was not a conspiracy ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Sheil takes the definition of conspiracy from Shakspeare's tragedy
</p>
<p>of Julius Caesar; Mr. O'Connell from Johnson. I must begin this place
</p>
<p>to dispute the authority of those writers, and I say, in point of law, a
</p>
<p>conspiracy means where two or more persons concur in the prosecution
</p>
<p>of an illegal object, or if they concur in the execution of a common
</p>
<p>legal design, by means which are contrary to law, they are guilty of a
</p>
<p>conspiracy, no matter whether it be open or secret, no matter what its
</p>
<p>nature is, because the test is not the secrecy, but the object of it.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, we say the traversers have concurred in a common and
</p>
<p>unlawful design, which I characterize as an attempt to procure, by
</p>
<p>means of intimidation, the Repeal of the Union, which, according to
</p>
<p>the law of this country, cannot be repealed but by an Act of Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment  the result of the free-will of the Legislature. With regard to
</p>
<p>secrecy, some conspiracies may be of such a nature as would necessa-
</p>
<p>rily involve publicity. What does the indictment charge ? that the
</p>
<p>G65
</p>
<p>traversers entered into a common plan by means of seditious speeches,
</p>
<p>and large meetings, and oilier means set forth in the indictment, to
</p>
<p>effect changes which can only be brought about legally by the inter-
</p>
<p>vention of Parliament. It is therefore not only a part, but a neces-
</p>
<p>sary part of the design, that the means used should be public. It
</p>
<p>is therefore monstrous to tell a jury that this is no conspiracy, because
</p>
<p>it is public. Gentlemen, I am now addressing you in the popular
</p>
<p>meaning of conspiracy, but its legal consideration you will take from
</p>
<p>the Court. Gentlemen, you will take the law not from me, nor from
</p>
<p>the counsel for the traversers, but from the high tribunal before whom
</p>
<p>the case is trying. The Judges will direct you as to the law of
</p>
<p>the case  the facts are exclusively for you. But I was anxious to
</p>
<p>disabuse your minds of what was pressed on them, with regard to con-
</p>
<p>spiracy necessarily meaning a secret proceeding. A conspiracy may be a
</p>
<p>combination to do an illegal act, a conspiracy, for instance, to murder, or
</p>
<p>rob a man, or to commit any other crime, that is, any crime which,
</p>
<p>if he did commit, he would be liable to punishment for ; but a
</p>
<p>conspiracy may also exist to bring about an object which per se
</p>
<p>is not unlawful, by unlawful means, and it is curious to observe the
</p>
<p>anxiety of counsel to dispute the soundness of this definition in point
</p>
<p>of law. You find they were labouring to convince you that the tra-
</p>
<p>versers are prosecuting a legal object, and that they might fairly and
</p>
<p>legally accomplish that object, and that this was an attempt to put a
</p>
<p>stop to the legal and constitutional rights which the subject is entitled
</p>
<p>to exercise. It is, therefore, of great importance that you should
</p>
<p>understand that no matter what the object is, if they seek to bring it
</p>
<p>about by improper and unlawful means, they are guilty of a conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Suppose, for instance, I am entitled to an estate, and my object was
</p>
<p>to get back the possession of it, it would be fair and legal for me to
</p>
<p>do so by legal and constitutional means; but if I conspire with other
</p>
<p>persons to turn out the person in possession by forcible means, or to
</p>
<p>bring witnesses to swear what is false, in order to obtain possession of
</p>
<p>the estate, then I am guilty of a conspiracy, no matter whether the
</p>
<p>object which I intend to accomplish is legal or not.

</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen, I will call your particular attention ^to the
</p>
<p>nature of the charges in the indictment, which I am not sure you
</p>
<p>yet fully understand. The first allegation is, that these traversers,
</p>
<p>with others, entertained the common and unlawful design of ex-
</p>
<p>citing disaffection in the minds of Her Majesty's subjects, and to
</p>
<p>excite them to seditious opposition to the Government and Consti-
</p>
<p>tution. We next charge them with having combined and con-
</p>
<p>federated for the purpose of creating animosity, jealousy, and ill-
</p>
<p>will between different classes of Her Majesty's subjects, and more par-
</p>
<p>cularly with exciting that feeling in the minds of the people of Ire-
</p>
<p>land towards their fellow-subjects in England. The next was for
</p>
<p>combining to excite in the army a spirit of discontent and disaffection.
</p>
<p>All these attempts, I admit, are so many means to bring about their
</p>
<p>ultimate object, the Repeal of the Union. I concede that to have
</p>
<p>been their ultimate object. That is not the question we are trying,
</p>
<p>We say that they have resorted to illegal means to obtain that object,
</p>
<p>4Q
</p>
<p>G66
</p>
<p>and this is the only question you have to determine. We next say
</p>
<p>that the traversers have combined to cause large multitudes to assem-
</p>
<p>ble together in different parts of the country, for the purpose of ex-
</p>
<p>citing alarm and intimidation, and procuring thereby, and by the de- -
</p>
<p>monstration and exhibition, not the use, of physical force, the Repeal
</p>
<p>of the Union, which only can be legitimately repealed by an uncon-
</p>
<p>trolled Act of the Legislature. I say by the exhibition, not the use
</p>
<p>of physical force, because you will find that all the evidence shows the
</p>
<p>peaceable nature of these meetings, and so far from that being evi-
</p>
<p>dence in their favour, it shows that these were the only means by
</p>
<p>which a plan of this sort could be accomplished. Tranquillity and
</p>
<p>peace at each particular meeting were indispensable to the success of
</p>
<p>their scheme, and it is ridiculous for them to say, that the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General said that the more peaceable the meetings the greater the
</p>
<p>crime ; he did not say any such thing ; what he did say was that a
</p>
<p>single meeting cannot be said to be illegal because it is peaceable, but
</p>
<p>where there is a succession of meetings, and there is no breach of the
</p>
<p>peace, we say it was so because the conspiracy was that there should
</p>
<p>be no breach of the peace. It is said we are prosecuting the people
</p>
<p>of Ireland because they exercised a legal right. We are not pro-
</p>
<p>secuting the 250,000 persons who assembled at Tara, but we
</p>
<p>are prosecuting those persons who assembled and got up those
</p>
<p>meetings in order to make these multitudes the instruments,
</p>
<p>by this exhibition of physical force, of intimidating the Legis-
</p>
<p>lature. Lastly, the traversers are charged for having combined
</p>
<p>to bring into discredit the Courts for the administration of justice;
</p>
<p>to bring into disrepute the legal tribunals, and to establish in their
</p>
<p>room Arbitrators, not to decide, on one particular occasion, a dis-
</p>
<p>pute between two parties, but to usurp the prerogative of the Crown,
</p>
<p>by putting men in authority as Judges, with a diploma from the
</p>
<p>Loyal National Repeal Association of Ireland. Now, from this you
</p>
<p>will at once see what these charges comprise.
</p>
<p>We charge the traversers with a conspiracy to do an illegal thing,
</p>
<p>and also to bring about that which is legal in itself, the Repeal of the

</p>
<p>Union, by illegal means, namely, by the exhibition of physical force,
</p>
<p>and the intimidation likely to be thereby caused. It is immaterial, there-
</p>
<p>fore, to see whether the division which I have referred to is well founded
</p>
<p>or not, or whether these two branches of the conspiracy are only one.
</p>
<p>We have brought forward charges applicable to each ; and before I
</p>
<p>have done, I have no doubt that each branch of the conspiracy will
</p>
<p>be as clearly proved, and as manifest to every person, as ever a
</p>
<p>charge was in a Court of Justice.
</p>
<p>There is another point upon which I think it right you should
</p>
<p>be informed, as respects the law of conspiracy. As I have collected
</p>
<p>from the observations of some of my learned friends who addressed
</p>
<p>you, it was argued, that unless you are satisfied that the traversers
</p>
<p>entertained all the designs which the Crown impute to them, you
</p>
<p>cannot convict them on this indictment. Gentlemen, the Court will
</p>
<p>inform you, that that is not so. If you are satisfied with regard to
</p>
<p>any part of it, if you conceive that any one part has been proved,
</p>
<p>607
</p>
<p>you must find a verdict on that part, although you may not think the
</p>
<p>whole has been proved, because there are counts applicable to each
</p>
<p>branch of the case. Lastly, it is not necessary that you should come
</p>
<p>to the conclusion that all the traversers are guilty, because the case
</p>
<p>of each is separate and distinct. The indictment says, that they
</p>
<p>were banded together for a certain purpose ; and if you should doubt
</p>
<p>that one of them went the whole length with the rest, if you think
</p>
<p>that any one was fully innocent of the object of the rest, if you
</p>
<p>conscientiously believe that one of them was innocently involved,
</p>
<p>without a guilty intention, I am far from saying he should not have
</p>
<p>the benefit of that doubt. Therefore, if you come to the conclusion
</p>
<p>that the traversers, or any two or more of them, combined with the
</p>
<p>design, and for the purposes alleged in the indictment, or any one
</p>
<p>or more of them, you must find them guilty; but if you are not
</p>
<p>satisfied that the traversers, or any two or more of them, combined
</p>
<p>for all these purposes, or for any one or more of them, you must
</p>
<p>acquit them.
</p>
<p>I shall now, Gentlemen, for a few moments, address myself to
</p>
<p>their Lordships, on the law of conspiracy ; and I beg you to attend
</p>
<p>to these observations, although I address them more particularly to
</p>
<p>the Court, because it is from the Court you will receive those direc-
</p>
<p>tions, which will enable you rightly to guide yourselves upon the law
</p>
<p>of the case. There has been a sort of doubt thrown, by the counsel
</p>
<p>for some of the traversers, upon the definition of conspiracy, as laid
</p>
<p>down in some recent authorities. That definition is this,  a conspi-
</p>
<p>racy is an agreement or combination, either to effect a purpose illegal
</p>
<p>in itself, or to bring about a legal purpose by unlawful means ; that is
</p>
<p>the definition laid down by Lord Denman, in Rex v. Jones, 4
</p>
<p>B. & Ad. 349. 1 beg your attention to his observations, hecause I
</p>
<p>think Lord Denman never did contradict that definition : " The
</p>
<p>" indictment ought to charge a conspiracy, either to do an unlawful
</p>
<p>" act, or a lawful act by unlawful means." Mr. Fitzgibbon has taken
</p>
<p>upon himself to say that this was a mere dictum in this part of his
</p>
<p>judgment. My Lords, it is no obiter dictum, it is part of the judg-

</p>
<p>ment of the Court, the law is there distinctly laid down, because if
</p>
<p>the indictment contained either charge, it would have been good,
</p>
<p>but it did not contain either, and it was therefore held bad. Mr.
</p>
<p>Justice Parke, who was a very distinguished Judge, and particularly
</p>
<p>conversant with criminal law, uses the same language, he says : " I
</p>
<p>" am of the same opinion. This indictment ought to have shown a
</p>
<p>" conspiracy, to do an unlawful act, or to do a lawful act by unlaw-
</p>
<p>" ful means." It therefore was not a dictum, but an elaborate de-
</p>
<p>cision of the Judges who presided. In the case of Rex v. Seward,
</p>
<p>1 Ad. & Ellis, 713, Lord Denman repeats the same language, and in
</p>
<p>the same case, Justice Littledale says : " The mere procuring this
</p>
<p>" marriage was a legal act in itself, and the indictment does not
</p>
<p>" state that such procuring was effected by any unlawful means or
</p>
<p>" devices, or false pretences. If it had been alleged to have been
</p>
<p>" done with a sinister purpose, and by unlawful means, the statement
</p>
<p>" would have been sufficient." And Justice Taunton says : " Merely
</p>
<p>608
</p>
<p>" persuading an unmarried man and woman in poor circumstances,
</p>
<p>" to contract matrimony, is not an offence. If, indeed, it were done by
</p>
<p>" unfair and undue means, it might be unlawful." Then comes the
</p>
<p>case of Regina v. Peak, 9 Ad. & El. 690, in which Mr. Fitz-
</p>
<p>gibbon said Lord Denman retracted his definition of conspiracy. I
</p>
<p>must confess, when I first read it, I did not understand, as 1 think I
</p>
<p>do now, his observations. The counsel who argued the case cited
</p>
<p>Lord Denman's definition in these words : " An indictment for a
</p>
<p>" conspiracy ought to show, either that it was for an unlawful pur-
</p>
<p>" pose, or to effect a lawful purpose by unlawful means." And Lord
</p>
<p>Denman said, " I do not think the antithesis very correct." Now I
</p>
<p>take his meaning to be this. It was incorrect to use the word "pur-
</p>
<p>pose," because it cannot be the procuring of an unlawful pur-
</p>
<p>pose. It is the purpose which makes the crime. You will find
</p>
<p>the word used in another report is " act." The purpose is what
</p>
<p>is in the mind of the party who does the act, whether a man
</p>
<p>combine to effect an illegal act, or a legal act by unlawful
</p>
<p>means, the purpose in both cases is illegal, because the purpose
</p>
<p>is the object, or perhaps the conspiracy, and therefore it was not cor-
</p>
<p>rect to say, that in case of conspiracy, there was a lawful purpose, and
</p>
<p>consequently Lord Denman's criticising that the antithesis was not
</p>
<p>correct, implied that there could be no legal purpose in a conspiracy.
</p>
<p>In the report of the same case in 1 Per. & Dav. 510, these words
</p>
<p>are omitted. The same definition is also laid down by the late Lord
</p>
<p>Chief Justice of this Court in Rex v. Forbes, 1 East, 46:2 ; and
</p>
<p>Regina v. Vincent, 9 Carr. & P. 109 ; and in Watson's Case, 32 St.
</p>
<p>Tr. 7; and yet Mr. Fitzgibbon has taken upon him to question
</p>
<p>the soundness of that definition ; but he has not cited or referred to
</p>
<p>any authority to the contrary. You will find the case of Rex v. Se-
</p>
<p>ward, which is reported in 9 Ad. & El. 690 ; also reported 3 Nev. &
</p>
<p>Man. 561, in which the reporter gives the words of Lord Denman
</p>
<p>more correctly. Lord Denman there says : " No indictment for a
</p>
<p>" conspiracy can be maintained unless it charge that the defendants
</p>
<p>" conspired to do an unlawful act, or to do a lawful act by unlawful

</p>
<p>" means ;" there the reporter correctly gives the words ; he does not
</p>
<p>use the word "purposes."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I shall now proceed to explain to you the cause, the
</p>
<p>necessary cause, why this prosecution was delayed until the pe-
</p>
<p>riod at which it was commenced. I have already observed upon the
</p>
<p>singular nature of a defence of that sort. Do you remember how
</p>
<p>often, over and over again, Mr. O'Connell told the persons assem-
</p>
<p>bled at these meetings that he was violating no law whatever, that he
</p>
<p>would carry them safely through the Convention Act ; that he would
</p>
<p>have his council of 300 sitting in the presence of the Attorney-Ge-
</p>
<p>neral, and that he hurled his high and haughty defiance at the law
</p>
<p>officers of the Crown. Is such language as that consistent with the
</p>
<p>defence which he has adopted ? " You suffered us [he says] to hold
</p>
<p>those meetings without prosecuting us; you suffered us to go on."
</p>
<p>When Mr. O'Connell challenged us to come forward, was it not his
</p>
<p>duty to have shown you that he did not violate the law ? Does he
</p>
<p>669
</p>
<p>not. owe it to those unfortunate persons he has deluded  does he not
</p>
<p>owe it to the Public  does he not owe it to his co-traversers to show
</p>
<p>in point of fact that there was no violation of the law in his proceed-
</p>
<p>ings ? Gentlemen, you have already heard we did not impute to any
</p>
<p>one of those meetings the character of illegality, on the ground that
</p>
<p>they had a tendency to disturb the public peace, and if this fact had
</p>
<p>been kept in view, they might have saved themselves a vast deal of
</p>
<p>unnecessary trouble in quoting long extracts from Mr. O'Connell's
</p>
<p>speeches, and calling the attention of the jury again and again to
</p>
<p>the circumstances of his having repeatedly admonished his hearers to
</p>
<p>conduct themselves in a peaceable manner, and not to outrage the
</p>
<p>public tranquillity. They might have spared themselves those ob-
</p>
<p>servations, because none of these meetings was open to prosecution
</p>
<p>so far as they were concerned. Apply that observation to the argu-
</p>
<p>ment that we commenced no prosecution during the whole of last
</p>
<p>year. Suppose we had selected a meeting in the month of March
</p>
<p>last, and prosecuted those who had attended it for being present at
</p>
<p>an unlawful assembly ; what would have been the defence, and the
</p>
<p>triumphant defence in that case? Why that the meeting terminated
</p>
<p>peaceably; that, though numerously attended, it did not cause any
</p>
<p>alarm to the public; that the parties met for the ostensible purpose
</p>
<p>of exercising the legal right of petitioning the Legislature for the re-
</p>
<p>peal of an Act of Parliament. That defence it would be impossible
</p>
<p>for us to meet. If we had prosecuted them we should have been
</p>
<p>deservedly defeated. But, Gentlemen, you have yet to learn,
</p>
<p>and the Court will, I think, tell you, that I am right when I say,
</p>
<p>that with respect to that, it is not merely the conduct or demeanor
</p>
<p>of the persons who attended a meeting which will render that
</p>
<p>meeting criminal or illegal : violence, breach of the peace, intimida-
</p>
<p>tion, or injury to life or property, are not the only circumstances that
</p>
<p>may make a meeting illegal. No doubt, if a number of persons tu-
</p>
<p>multuously assemble together to commit an injury to property, that is
</p>
<p>illegal ; but, Gentlemen, a meeting may also be unlawful, because it
</p>
<p>had an unlawful object, because it is the means resorted to to bring

</p>
<p>about an unlawful end ; and until you know what the end is, until the
</p>
<p>object of the conspiracy to which that meeting was ancillary be fully
</p>
<p>developed and disclosed, until it is capable of legal proof, until that
</p>
<p>moment arrives, it is impossible to show that any one meeting, held
</p>
<p>for that purpose, is an unlawful meeting*. But, when circumstances
</p>
<p>have occurred which show the purpose kept in view all along by the
</p>
<p>parties who caused that meeting to assemble ; when that purpose is
</p>
<p>clearly demonstrated by their subsequent acts ; when the conspiracy
</p>
<p>has proceeded to its consummation, then the original meeting,
</p>
<p>which, standing by itself is lawful by reference to the whole
</p>
<p>conspiracy, becomes at once criminal, unlawful, and open to pro-
</p>
<p>secution. Therefore, I say that every one of those meetings was
</p>
<p>unlawful, not because the persons assembled had offered injury
</p>
<p>to life or property, but because, as it now appears, they were
</p>
<p>for the unlawful purpose of exhibiting to the Legislature a phy-
</p>

<p>sical force, whereby it was expected they would frighten the Legisla-
</p>
<p>ture into a concession of a Repeal of the Union.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I do not know where my learned friend, Mr.
</p>
<p>Fitzgibbon, found the fact which authorized him in charging the
</p>
<p>Government, or the Attorney- General, in conniving at what now
</p>
<p>appears to be an infraction of the law. Is it in the speech of Sir
</p>
<p>Robert Peel? Is it in the speech from the throne? Is it by the
</p>
<p>dismissal of the Magistrates for attending Repeal meetings? Are these
</p>
<p>marks of sanction of the prosecution of this insane and mischievous
</p>
<p>agitation? Are those facts upon which they can say that we have en-
</p>
<p>couraged and seduced the traversers to the commission of a crime ;
</p>
<p>No, tbere never were offenders who had less reason to complain of
</p>
<p>being seduced into crime than Mr. O'Connell and his associates.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I stated to you, in order to enable the Government effec-
</p>
<p>tually to vindicate the law, as I trust they now will ; it was necessary,
</p>
<p>not only that we should understand what their object was, and that
</p>
<p>we should be prepared with evidence for a jury, of the existence of
</p>
<p>that object and the nature of it, and to make such case in the eye of
</p>
<p>the world as would not only justify the prosecution, but coerce the
</p>
<p>jury to find a verdict against the offenders, because it would be most
</p>
<p>improper in a Government to institute a prosecution until they have
</p>
<p>procured these means. Do you suppose that this required no time
</p>
<p>and trouble to collect this evidence ? Do you suppose the facts
</p>
<p>which have been proved, could have been proved without great
</p>
<p>care and trouble. But when we find by certain proceedings which
</p>
<p>have been studiously kept out of your view for the last fortnight of
</p>
<p>the trial ; when we found what the parties had in view, then it became
</p>
<p>the duty of those entrusted with the administration of the law, to use
</p>
<p>every exertion to vindicate the law, and to avert the progress of this
</p>
<p>frightful evil. Gentlemen, I was surprised to hear it contended by
</p>
<p>the advocates for the rights and constitutional privileges of the sub-
</p>
<p>ject, that there should have been a Coercion Act. Why, if a Coer-
</p>
<p>cion Act had been resorted to, would it not have been said that it
</p>
<p>was an attempt by the Legislature to crush public discussion. They

</p>
<p>would say : " Why not assert the common law ? You should have
</p>
<p>resorted to a jury?" We have done so, and we have prosecuted
</p>
<p>this case in a regular, legal, and constitutional way ; with a degree of
</p>
<p>temperance, not in any manner showing a vindictive feeling. I
</p>
<p>think we cannot be charged with not giving the traversers the fullest
</p>
<p>latitude to defend themselves. There were many irrelevant topics
</p>
<p>introduced, to which we made no objection. We raised no technical
</p>
<p>objections; we permitted them to read speeches, and make their
</p>
<p>comments on them. Therefore, I say, it was most unfair to impute
</p>
<p>to the Government a criminal apathy, with regard to the progress of
</p>
<p>this evil ; or when they had taken up the case, to impute to them
</p>
<p>any thing like an attempt to overbear public discussion, or to crush
</p>
<p>constitutional rights in not resorting to an Act of Parliament until
</p>
<p>the common law had been found ineffectual.
</p>
<p>I have said that a meeting might be unlawful, not merely from the
</p>
<p>C71
</p>
<p>circumstances which accompanied it at the time it took place, but from
</p>
<p>its tendency and object. In the case of Redford v.Birley, 3 Stark.
</p>
<p>102, the Court distinguish between a riot and an unlawful assembly;
</p>
<p>they say :" A riot is where three or more are unlawfully collected
</p>
<p>" together, to do an unlawful act, as, if they are removing a nuisance
</p>
<p>" in a violent manner, and beat a man, that may constitute a riot.
</p>
<p>" Persons may be riotously assembling together, yet unless they do
</p>
<p>" some act of violence, it would not go so far as to constitute, actu-
</p>
<p>" tually, a riot. But if they come armed, or meet in such a way as
</p>
<p>" to overawe and terrify other persons, that of itself may, perhaps,
</p>
<p>" under such circumstances, be an unlawful assembly. A riot or
</p>
<p>" riotous assembly is, where they come for some unlawful purpose,
</p>
<p>" intending to do something in violence, but do not go to the full ex-
</p>
<p>" tent, or take any actual step for accomplishing their purpose. But
</p>
<p>" an unlawful assembly is, in any case, where they meet together, in
</p>
<p>" a manner and under circumstances which the law does not allow,
</p>
<p>" but makes it criminal in those persons meeting together in such a
</p>
<p>u manner, knowingly, and with such purposes as are in point of law
</p>
<p>" criminal." Now, it is impossible that we could satisfy you what
</p>
<p>the purpose of those meetings were, until that purpose had been
</p>
<p>avowed, and I shall show you by-and-by, that it has been avowed.
</p>
<p>But it is right to disabuse the public mind with respect to another
</p>
<p>objection urged against those proceedings. It is said, if these
</p>
<p>meetings were unlawful, why not prosecute them as such ? and if
</p>
<p>we could now show that such a meeting was unlawful, even with
</p>
<p>reference to its purpose, why did we not indict the parties present
</p>
<p>then for attending an unlawful assembly ? Now, first being per-
</p>
<p>suaded that this combination did exist, and feeling it to be our duty not
</p>
<p>to prosecute the inferior and subordinate instruments, by whom, and
</p>
<p>through whose intervention, the purpose of that combination was
</p>
<p>sought to be effected, but that we ought to bring forward the heads
</p>
<p>of it to trial, feeling that to be the bold, straightforward, manly course,
</p>
<p>we saw that that could not be done except through the medium of an
</p>
<p>indictment for a conspiracy. If we had included in the indictment

</p>
<p>for a conspiracy, counts for attending unlawful assemblies, we should
</p>
<p>have been exposed to the risk of a defeat upon technical and legal
</p>
<p>grounds; because it has been decided that if you include several de-
</p>
<p>fendants in one indictment on a charge of conspiracy, and also put in
</p>
<p>a charge for attending an unlawful meeting, and if you fail to prove
</p>
<p>that all the defendants attended at that meeting, you must elect
</p>
<p>between the two charges, and cannot proceed on both ; that has been
</p>
<p>so decided in the Queen v. Murphy, 8 C. & P. But there is
</p>
<p>another and still more serious and insuperable difficulty which would
</p>
<p>have attended this course, which they say we ought to have pursued,
</p>
<p>that is, including counts for attending unlawful assemblies with
</p>
<p>counts for a conspiracy. Your Lordships will recollect that the gist
</p>
<p>of the charge, is a conspiracy evidenced by the number of meetings
</p>
<p>which took place, by the continuity, and unity of purpose evinced at
</p>
<p>each of these successive meetings, every one of them was a link in
</p>
<p>G72
</p>
<p>the combination, every one of them was a step in the prosecution of
</p>
<p>it ; it was, therefore, indispensable that all the meetings should be
</p>
<p>brought before the Court and the jury. Now, Gentlemen, these
</p>
<p>meetings took place in many parts of Ireland, in Galway, Waterford,
</p>
<p>Meath, &c. and their Lordships will tell you that not one of those
</p>
<p>meetings could have been tried in this indictment, because it is a
</p>
<p>principle in the criminal law that the trial must take place in the
</p>
<p>county where the offence has been committed. Now there were
</p>
<p>twenty meetings, and there must have been twenty indictments before
</p>
<p>twenty different juries, if we adopted the course of prosecuting them
</p>
<p>for attending unlawful assemblies ; you could not try any one of those
</p>
<p>meetings save and except as we charged it to be, as an ingredient in the
</p>
<p>conspiracy of which those meetings were so many links ; it is there-
</p>
<p>fore idle and preposterous to say, that we could have adopted any
</p>
<p>other course to bring to justice, through the intervention of the law
</p>
<p>and of a jury, the real delinquents in this case.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen I will not take up more of your time by observations on that
</p>
<p>part of this case as to the conduct of the Government in adopting this mode
</p>
<p>of prosecution, and not bringing it forward at an earlier stage. But Mr.
</p>
<p>Sheil having dwelt at considerable length upon this, has thought it his
</p>
<p>duty to address himself to another topic, which, if he recollected what
</p>
<p>took place before this trial, he might have spared. He paid the Court
</p>
<p>the compliment of saying, that he did not believe the Judges were cor-
</p>
<p>rupt. He said he would not throw out such an insinuation, and he
</p>
<p>ultimately went the length of saying, that he believed they were not.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I will not take upon me to vindicate that high tribunal
</p>
<p>before which I now stand. It would be presumptuous in me to
</p>
<p>attempt it ; but that was followed up by another, to which
</p>
<p>I think it right to refer, I mean his observations as to the constitu-
</p>
<p>tion of the jury who are trying this case. You will recollect his
</p>
<p>quotation from the speech of Mr. Burrowes. Mr. Burrowes, at the
</p>
<p>trial of Sheridan and Kirwan, animadverted upon the array of the
</p>
<p>jury upon that occasion. He impugned the conduct of the officer
</p>
<p>who arrayed that jury, for not having put upon it some Roman Ca-

</p>
<p>tholics. It is not for me to say whether he acted correctly or not,
</p>
<p>but it is a most monstrous perversion of justice to apply an observa-
</p>
<p>tion of that sort to a jury like the present  to a jury not returned by
</p>
<p>the Sheriff, but selected by ballot, out of seven hundred and seven-
</p>
<p>teen names. Do they mean to say there was any impropriety in the
</p>
<p>ballot before the officer? How could we influence the result of the
</p>
<p>ballot ? But, says Mr. Sheil, when forty-eight names were drawn
</p>
<p>out, ten or eleven Roman Catholics were struck off by the Crown
</p>
<p>Solicitor, and, consequently, the jury was packed for the purpose of
</p>
<p>trying this case. Now, I must say I was astonished at the temerity
</p>
<p>of my Right Hon. friend, in again calling public attention to this sub-
</p>
<p>ject. Upon a motion which took place in this case prior to the trial,
</p>
<p>the foul insinuation was made ; foul I call it, because I think the
</p>
<p>Crown Solicitor was never actuated by the feeling which was im-
</p>
<p>puted to him ; that those gentlemen were struck off merely because
</p>
<p>they were Roman Catholics. The Crown Solicitor was bound to
</p>
<p>G73
</p>
<p>strike off twelve ; he struck off twelve accordingly, anil in these were
</p>
<p>included the names of ten gentlemen professing the Roman Catholic
</p>
<p>faith. Upon that occasion Mr. Kemmis, the Crown Solicitor made
</p>
<p>an affidavit, in which he stated that he had received information which
</p>
<p>he then believed, and still believed to be true, that these ten gentle-
</p>
<p>men were members of the Repeal Association. The answer to that
</p>
<p>fact was that it was not so, and it was distinctly stated that that state-
</p>
<p>ment would be verified by affidavit. Who made that statement?
</p>
<p>Why Mr. Sheil himself  he distinctly said he was authorized to con-
</p>
<p>tradict that statement, and that it would be shown, that it was not so,
</p>
<p>by affidavit. From that hour to this moment, no such affidavit has
</p>
<p>ever been made. Whether it can be made, I have my own opinion.
</p>
<p>The making of such an affidavit is a serious thing, but suffice it to
</p>
<p>say, that the affidavit has not been made. I should not have advert-
</p>
<p>ed to this most irrelevant and most improper topic, but that it made
</p>
<p>a prominent point in Mr. Sheil's statement, and I think it would have
</p>
<p>been the greatest dereliction of my public duty not to give a full,
</p>
<p>explicit, and satisfactory answer to this assertion ; and I think I may
</p>
<p>fearlessly appeal, on the sufficiency of that answer, to every individu-
</p>
<p>al present at this trial ; it was therefore wrong in my learned friend to
</p>
<p>insinuate, if not directly charge that the jury was, in any degree,
</p>
<p>selected by the Crown, or that the exclusion of any person was the
</p>
<p>result of his religious opinions. I ask you, Gentlemen, would it be
</p>
<p>right for the law officers of the Crown to have allowed the members
</p>
<p>of the Association  the legality of whose acts it will be your duty to
</p>
<p>determine  to sit in judgment upon the acts of the body to which
</p>
<p>they belong. Is that the fair, impartial mode on which they say the
</p>
<p>jury should be constructed? If that be their opinion, it is not what
</p>
<p>I would call a fair and impartial jury. I call that a fair and impartial
</p>
<p>jury, one which is not prejudiced, and which are not, from their acts
</p>
<p>or from their declarations, in such a situation as to preclude them
</p>
<p>from doing that duty and finding that verdict which the law and jus-
</p>
<p>tice require from them. Mr. Sheil made another use of this alleged
</p>
<p>partiality or alleged prejudice which might exist in your minds with

</p>
<p>respect to his clients, which 1 find difficult to reconcile with the law
</p>
<p>or the Constitution  it is this ; he said : " You are a jury of Protes-
</p>
<p>" tants, sworn to decide a case in which some of the traversers at the
</p>
<p>" bar are Roman Catholics, that your verdict ought to be satisfactory
</p>
<p>u to the public; I therefore call upon you to make compensation to
</p>
<p>" the traversers at the bar, for the disadvantages under which they
</p>
<p>" labour, in having the merits of their case decided by those who dif-
</p>
<p>" fer from them in religious opinions."
</p>
<p>Mr. Shell.  My learned friend is not quite accurate. What I
</p>
<p>said was, that I thought the jury would be more solicitous in taking
</p>
<p>into consideration the nature of the case as it affected the traversers,
</p>
<p>in consequence of the names of sixty-five Roman Catholics havinc
</p>
<p>been struck out of the panel.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General.  However, I will not dwell upon the
</p>
<p>subject, further than to make this observation, that you will not
</p>
<p>suffer these observations to have the effect of inducing you to swerve
</p>
<p>4R
</p>
<p>674
</p>
<p>in the slightest degree from the duty you have to perform. You have
</p>
<p>a solemn and sacred duty to discharge, and I should not call upon
</p>
<p>you to find a verdict, because you entertain religious opinions dif-
</p>
<p>ferent from some of the traversers. I deprecate using an argument
</p>
<p>of that sort for the purpose of inducing you not to do that duty which
</p>
<p>you are imperatively called on by your oaths and the evidence to do-
</p>
<p>As I understand Mr. Shed's observation now, I agree with him, it is
</p>
<p>your duty, for the reasons which he has stated, anxiously to weigh
</p>
<p>this case, anxiously to examine whether it has been proved, and if
</p>
<p>you are satisfied on the evidence that it is proved, not to suffer the
</p>
<p>imputation that you are of a different religious opinion with the tra-
</p>
<p>versers, to interfere with the firm and proper discharge of your duty.
</p>
<p>Mr. Sheil then adverted to the nature of the charge itself, from
</p>
<p>which, he said, he would rescue his client, and he did attempt to do so,
</p>
<p>not by addressing observations to the evidence, but by asserting
</p>
<p>their right to meet together in a constitutional manner, to state their
</p>
<p>grievances, and to petition for their redress. With respect to that, I
</p>
<p>must say, that I do not attempt to dispute the existence of that right.
</p>
<p>I, for the present, only make these observations, but when I come
</p>
<p>to advert to the evidence, I think I shall satisfy you, Gentlemen of
</p>
<p>the Jury, that this right was, in the course of these proceedings, a
</p>
<p>mere pretext ; I say, in the course of these proceedings, for I do
</p>
<p>not at present mean to say, that any thing that occurred in the Re-
</p>
<p>peal Association in 1841 or 1842, so far as I know of, ought to be
</p>
<p>made the subject of a prosecution, or could be successfully prose-
</p>
<p>cuted ; but I will make this observation, and I beg to call your
</p>
<p>attention to it, that it is for their conduct in 1843 they are now
</p>
<p>brought before you, and I think you will see by-and-by, that
</p>
<p>whatever may have been the original Constitution  whatever
</p>
<p>may have been the original object  whatever the original conduct of
</p>
<p>the Society, which was formed in July, 1840, the persons who were
</p>
<p>promoting the designs of that Association in 1843, were pursuing a
</p>
<p>course utterly at variance with the law and Constitution of this
</p>
<p>country. I therefore make them a present of all the speeches that

</p>
<p>were made during the years 1840, 1841, and 1842. I am not im-
</p>
<p>peaching their conduct at that period. I am willing to concede for
</p>
<p>the purposes of this trial, that nothing exceptionable appeared during
</p>
<p>that period. With regard to the meeting in 1810, at which Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell delivered a speech, which was read to you, the High
</p>
<p>Sheriff presided, and many respectable citizens attended. I also fully
</p>
<p>and freely admit that there was nothing at that meeting, or the pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings of it, at all at variance with the law. I admit further, that
</p>
<p>the sentiments of Mr. O'Connell on that occasion are, to a certain
</p>
<p>extent, and only to a certain extent, identical with those which
</p>
<p>he has latterly professed ; but, we are not trying Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell for inconsistency in any political opinion. We are not saying
</p>
<p>that the traversers have, for the first time, proclaimed them-
</p>
<p>selves friends to the severance of the Legislative connexion. I
</p>
<p>am willing to concede that they always entertained them ; but
</p>
<p>we are prosecuting them for endeavouring to carry out those prin-
</p>
<p>ciples in 1843, by unlawful means. If in 1800, or 1810, or in any
</p>
<p>CT5
</p>
<p>period antecedent to 1S43, the same course had been adopted as has
</p>
<p>been 1 pursued in 1843, I should unhesitatingly say they would have
</p>
<p>been at that time liable to a prosecution. The meeting- in 1810 was
</p>
<p>perfective onstitu'ional and legal; a requisition of the most respec-
</p>
<p>table merchants was presented to the sheriff, and be convened that
</p>
<p>meeting; but why bring forward these proceedings to bear upon the
</p>
<p>case ? They have no reference to this case, because on that occasion
</p>
<p>there was but one meeting, not a succession of multitudinous meet-
</p>
<p>ings, assembled for the purpose of intimidating the Legislature. A
</p>
<p>reference was made by Mr. Sheil to meetings held by other parties ;
</p>
<p>he spoke of the Hillsborough meeting. I will not take upon me to
</p>
<p>say whether that meeting was legal or not, but I do not see that there
</p>
<p>was anything occurred at that which would subject the parties to
</p>
<p>a prosecution. Their former conduct is then pressed into the service
</p>
<p>for the purpose of offering it as a justification of what they have done
</p>
<p>in 1843. Mr. Sheil said that Catholic Emancipation was carried in
</p>
<p>the same way, namely, by the peaceable demonstration of what he
</p>
<p>calls moral force. Now, Gentlemen of the Jury, as an abstract
</p>
<p>proposition, I do not dispute the right to meet in order to demonstrate
</p>
<p>to the Legislature what are the wishes of a great majority of the
</p>
<p>people of the country, but let this be done by petition, by peaceable
</p>
<p>meeting, or in any constitutional way the parties think fit to adopt.
</p>
<p>Had the traversers acted in this manner, no prosecution would have
</p>
<p>been instituted against them, but what I charge them with, is the
</p>
<p>demonstration, not of moral, but of physical force. Whether I am
</p>
<p>right or they are right, is a matter for you to decide ; I am merely
</p>
<p>answering a topic introduced by counsel which did not apply to the
</p>
<p>evidence; but I say our case is not that there was an exhibition of
</p>
<p>merely moral force, or a union of the will of a great number of persons,
</p>
<p>but that it was an exhibition of physical force not intended to satisfy
</p>
<p>the Parliament of the unanimity of opinion of a respectable, peaceable,
</p>
<p>and loyal part of the communit)', but for the purpose of showing that if
</p>
<p>the Union was not repealed, the effect would probably be a convulsion.
</p>
<p>But, Gentlemen, withregard to professions of peace, and reluctance to re-

</p>
<p>sort to violence, where credit is taken by Mr.O'Connell for having inter-
</p>
<p>fered to prevent these consequences, I will only ask you to give it thatde-
</p>
<p>gree of credit to which you will think it entitled, when you contrast it
</p>
<p>with his acts. There was another topic alluded to by Mr. Sheil, with
</p>
<p>respect to the manner in which Mr. O'Connell acted in the case of
</p>
<p>Sir Abraham Bradley King. No doubt that was very liberal, and Sir
</p>
<p>Abraham Bradley King testified his gratitude for it, and Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell has not lost the benefit of it, for it has been frequently adverted
</p>
<p>to by himself and by his counsel on this occasion; but, that that, how-
</p>
<p>ever meritorious it may be, should be offered as a defence, or an ex-
</p>
<p>planation of the conduct charged in the indictment, is really quite
</p>
<p>preposterous.
</p>
<p>I shall now pass on to the observations of Mr. Moore, who ap-
</p>
<p>peared on behalf of Mr. Tierney. He arraigned the policy of the
</p>
<p>676
</p>
<p>Government in instituting this prosecution, and asked did the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment think that the result of it, one way or the other, would tend to
</p>
<p>allay this agitation? Whether it will or not, is not forme to say, nor
</p>
<p>for you. Gentlemen of the Jury, I have my own opinion on that sub-
</p>
<p>ject ; so may others, so may you ; but I call upon you not to act on
</p>
<p>any opinion of the kind. If you are persuaded that the result of a
</p>
<p>verdict of guilty, against the traversers, would tend to allay this per-
</p>
<p>nicious agitation, yet, if you are not satisfied, upon the evidence, that
</p>
<p>you ought to find that verdict, I call upon you not to find it ; if, on the
</p>
<p>other hand, you are of opinion, that a contrary verdict would have an
</p>
<p>opposite effect, yet, if you are satisfied of the innocence of the tra-
</p>
<p>versers, I call upon you to find that verdict. I call upon you to discard
</p>
<p>such opinions from your minds, and to find a verdict which the evi-
</p>
<p>dence will warrant, regardless of what the consequences of that ver-
</p>
<p>dict may be. Mr. Moore has said that if Repeal be unattainable, it
</p>
<p>will drop of itself. Does that follow? Because I find the respectable
</p>
<p>portion of the community of opinion that it is unattainable  does it
</p>
<p>follow from that, that the mischievous consequences attending the ex-
</p>
<p>hibition of these multitudes of persons, should be allowed to continue ?
</p>
<p>Is this a state of things that should not be averted?
</p>
<p>If I find that such consequences will result from those proceed-
</p>
<p>ings, it is the bounden duty of the Crown to use their utmost endea-
</p>
<p>vours to use all lawful means in their power to put it down. Mr.
</p>
<p>Moore then said, that our proceedings have not been very consistent.
</p>
<p>He says that we ought to have proceeded against the publishers of
</p>
<p>those seditious speeches and papers, and prosecuted those persons ;
</p>
<p>but that would not have put an end to the evil complained of; where
</p>
<p>would be the use of prosecuting Mr. Duffy or Mr. Gray? But, said
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore : " Here is an unfair, oppressive, and unjust proceeding,
</p>
<p>" grouping all the traversers in one indictment ; and throwing down
</p>
<p>" what he calls a monster indictment, and calling on the jury
</p>
<p>" to select from this mass, and spell out a conspiracy." No
</p>
<p>doubt this indictment is a long one. Why was it so ? Be-
</p>
<p>cause the overt acts necessary to sustain the charge were nu-

</p>
<p>merous, but the charge itself is perfectly distinct and plain. You
</p>
<p>have heard that charge read to you, and you cannot have the slightest
</p>
<p>difficulty in comprehending it. But because the facts necessary to
</p>
<p>enable you to judge of the guilt or innocence of the traversers were
</p>
<p>numerous and complicated, and the evidence is various, are we to be
</p>
<p>taunted and told that this is an unfair and unjust mode of proceed-
</p>
<p>ing? Why those matters which we have put forward might have
</p>
<p>been altogether omitted ; they are only evidence, and nothing but
</p>
<p>evidence. Mr. Moore then says that the Attorney-General has lain
</p>
<p>by ; he does not say, what was insinuated by Mr. Sheil, that he had
</p>
<p>done so for the purpose of seducing those persons into crime, but
</p>
<p>that it was the duty of the law officer of the Crown not to suffer
</p>
<p>those persons to do those acts, as they were acts in violation of
</p>
<p>the law. I have already answered that. But, besides this, Mr.
</p>
<p>67T
</p>
<p>Moore has insisted in strong language  I will not use personali-
</p>
<p>ties  but before he used such language, he should have considered
</p>
<p>what the real nature of the case was. He must have known per-
</p>
<p>fectly well the nature of the charge was not for attending illegal
</p>
<p>meetings; that it was not for the publication of a libel ; that it was
</p>
<p>not for a breach of the public peace ; but that it was for the forma-
</p>
<p>tion of a settled design, testified by the acts of the parties, to procure
</p>
<p>a Repeal of the Union by intimidation; first, by raising discontent
</p>
<p>and disaffection among the subjects of the Queen, and to excite them
</p>
<p>to hatred and contempt of the Government; secondly, to excite
</p>
<p>jealousies and ill-will among different classes of said subjects ; thirdly,
</p>
<p>to create discontent and disaffection amongst Her Majesty's subjects
</p>
<p>serving in the army ; fourthly, intending to bring into disrepute the es-
</p>
<p>tablished tribunals of the country ; and fifthly, by means of intimida-
</p>
<p>tion and the demonstration of great physical force, to procure changes
</p>
<p>to be made in the Government and Constitution of the realm. Mr.
</p>
<p>Moore should have known, and did know, that these were the
</p>
<p>charges, and he was certainly not warranted in ascribing to us the
</p>
<p>motives which he has done. He then said, that the Government
</p>
<p>had no right to interfere in dispersing the Clontarf meeting. It
</p>
<p>will be more convenient that I should pass that by for the present.
</p>
<p>He then adverted to another topic ; he said that the Grand Jury had
</p>
<p>taken a long time to deliberate before they found this bill. That was
</p>
<p>not a legitimate topic to advert to. How could it have been disposed
</p>
<p>of without taking time to consider it? He then alluded to a most ex-
</p>
<p>traordinary circumstance  that one of the Grand Jury had stated that
</p>
<p>he did not concur in that finding. 1 must say that was a most im-
</p>
<p>proper observation as could have been made. You are all well aware,
</p>
<p>that the Grand Jury are sworn not to disclose what takes place in
</p>
<p>their jury-room. When Mr. Moore stated that, notwithstanding that
</p>
<p>oath, one gentleman did state in Court that he dissented from the
</p>
<p>findingof the bill, itis improper to allude to that circumstance ; first, be-
</p>
<p>cause itisirregular ; secondly, becauseevidence is often brought before
</p>
<p>a petty jury that was not before a Grand Jury. He then says, that this

</p>
<p>is a charge of conspiracy, and that we should have given the date
</p>
<p>and time when it was concocted. 1 never heard of such an assertion
</p>
<p>upon a charge of this sort. Mr. Moore, when he addressed you, ad-
</p>
<p>mitted that we were not bound to prove that Mr. O'Connell and the
</p>
<p>other traverses went into a room together, and signed an agreement
</p>
<p>for this purpose. We were not bound to prove the original concoction
</p>
<p>of this conspiracy; all that we could prove were the acts of the par-
</p>
<p>ties; and to say that the charge is not proved, because we have not
</p>
<p>shown the day or the time it was concocted is a fallacy. We say that
</p>
<p>it took place in 1843; and if we satisfy you of that fact, you must
</p>
<p>convict the traversers, although we have not produced any documents
</p>
<p>to show the day it was entered into. All we are called upon to prove,
</p>
<p>or that we professed to prove, was, that there was a community of
</p>
<p>purpose between several persons, amongst whom were the traversers
</p>
<p>678
</p>
<p>at the bar, and that each of those persons acted for the prosecution of
</p>
<p>a common object. The Queen v. Murphy, 8 Carr. & Payne, and the
</p>
<p>Queen v. Frost, 9 Carr. & Payne, which have been already cited, suffi-
</p>
<p>ciently prove that evidence of the acts of the party was sufficient to
</p>
<p>sustain a charge of conspiracy. Mr. Moore said that the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General impeached the loyalty of the traversers. I do not impeach
</p>
<p>their loyalty ; I only say that they have embarked in an enterprise
</p>
<p>which is illegal; and, although any person violating the law might be
</p>
<p>said to be disloyal, yet I do not feel it necessary to impeach the
</p>
<p>general loyalty of the traversers.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, Mr. Hatchell, who was the next counsel, appeared on
</p>
<p>behalf of Mr. Ray. He insisted that his case was different from the
</p>
<p>other traversers, inasmuch as Mr. Ray was the paid officer of the Re-
</p>
<p>peal Association  that he was paid a salary for the functions he had
</p>
<p>to perform, and that he was, therefore, merely discharging his duty.
</p>
<p>Now, if the acts of the Association were unlawful, Mr. Ray had un-
</p>
<p>questionably made himself as responsible as any body else connected
</p>
<p>with it by concurring in them. He then said that Mr. Ray should
</p>
<p>have been omitted from the indictment, and that we should have ex-
</p>
<p>amined him as a witness. If we had done so, the first thing that
</p>
<p>would be said would be, that Mr. Ray had become a hired spy, the
</p>
<p>paid informer and servant of the Government. Would it not be said
</p>
<p>that his evidence should be received with caution and jealousy, for he
</p>
<p>had got the pay of the Government to betray his associates. In the
</p>
<p>whole course of the case we have not produced any person who could
</p>
<p>be called a spy or informer. No such evidence was resorted to. The
</p>
<p>witnesses we produced had no connexion with that body. Further,
</p>
<p>suppose Mr. Ray had been produced as a witness, why, in answer to
</p>
<p>the first question put to him, he would have appealed to the Court
</p>
<p>whether he was bound to answer questions which might criminate
</p>
<p>himself. Are we then to be told that we are keeping back evidence,
</p>
<p>when, in fact, the proceedings of this Association are all recorded ;
</p>
<p>books are kept, and why are not they produced ? If we prevented
</p>
<p>them from having Mr. Ray as a witness, by putting him in the

</p>
<p>indictment, we have not prevented them from showing, by the
</p>
<p>books of the Association, what had been done at it. Did you
</p>
<p>ever hear of a case where such evidence was brought forward
</p>
<p>in answer to a charge of this description as you heard yester-
</p>
<p>day? Not a person brought forward ; no document ; no officer
</p>
<p>connected with the Association, nothing to throw a ray of light upon
</p>
<p>the subject, which I will more clearly show when I advert to the evi-
</p>
<p>dence in detail ; so that instead of detracting from the case made by
</p>
<p>the Crown, the traversers' case would be found strongly to support it.
</p>
<p>It was then said that trials of this kind took place in England, and
</p>
<p>that there was no conviction, and Hunt's case was referred to. In
</p>
<p>that case Hunt was prosecuted for a conspiracy, and also for attending
</p>
<p>an unlawful assembly. The answer to that case is, he only attended
</p>
<p>one meeting, and that was not supposed sufficient evidence of a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, and the jury acquitted him of that charge, but convicted him
</p>
<p>679
</p>
<p>on the count for attending an unlawful assembly ; I therefore must
</p>
<p>protest against such cases being brought forward. In the Queen v.
</p>
<p>Vincent the traversers were found guilty of a conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, Mr. Fitzgibbon next came forward as
</p>
<p>counsel for Dr. Gray. He stigmatized this prosecution as illegal
</p>
<p>and unfair, he termed it a ministerial scourge to lash the people with.
</p>
<p>Now I must protest against an imputation of such a kind, which is
</p>
<p>not justified by the mode in which this trial has been conducted; on
</p>
<p>the contrary, have we not shown abundance of grounds why it should
</p>
<p>be tried, for the purpose of trying what Mr. O'Cpnnell challenged us
</p>
<p>to try  the legality of those proceedings? But I must say he has
</p>
<p>shown every disposition to evade that when he was prosecuted; but,
</p>
<p>said Mr. Fitzgibbon, it was unfairly conducted, or, to use his own
</p>
<p>words, " a blow had been given below the belt." If he means by
</p>
<p>that that we struck an unfair blow, I deny it; it was as fair and
</p>
<p>straightforward a blow as ever was struck ; no man can say but that
</p>
<p>they have had every topic, every benefit allowed them, that the
</p>
<p>wildest imagination could suggest. Mr. Fitzgibbon differs from Mr.
</p>
<p>Moore with regard to the law of conspiracy. He contended that
</p>
<p>every act of the conspirators should be connected, and that when one
</p>
<p>does one part connected with it, and another another part, that will not
</p>
<p>involve both ; but I consider the law to be this.  All that it is neces-
</p>
<p>sary to show is, not that those persons concurred in a particular act, or
</p>
<p>that each of them took part in that act, but that each were labouring
</p>
<p>in their way to effect the common object they had in view, and there-
</p>
<p>fore those became evidence against all. I think that the act of one
</p>
<p>becomes the act of all, and that if Mr. O'Connell by his speeches,
</p>
<p>and Mr. Duffy and Mr. Barrett by publishing them, and if another of
</p>
<p>the traversers by some other act, were labouring in one common cause ;
</p>
<p>though one might not know what the other was doing at a particular
</p>
<p>time, nevertheless the act of one, in furtherance of thatcommon design,
</p>
<p>will become the act of all. We are not seeking to visit upon one man
</p>
<p>the guilt of another, but we are seeking to charge him, not with
</p>
<p>doing a particular act, but that he was implicated in an unlawful de-

</p>
<p>sign with others, to further their common object; he therefore is
</p>
<p>guilty and answerable, not for the guilt of another but for his own.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon says, it is not unlawful to combine to obtain a
</p>
<p>Repeal of the Union ; certainly not, but it is illegal to combine to
</p>
<p>obtain it by intimidation, and the various other means charged by this
</p>
<p>indictment; but then he says, you seek to convict my client for the
</p>
<p>public good. If you believe that Dr. Gray is not guilty, say so ; but
</p>
<p>do not be turned from your duty by such assertions as these. Mr.
</p>
<p>Fitzgibbon stated, he would explain every part of his client's conduct,
</p>
<p>and attempted to do so; but it is a very remarkable circumstance,
</p>
<p>that he never adverted to any single meeting, from the beginning to
</p>
<p>the end of 1S43, except the meeting at Mullaghmast. He certainly
</p>
<p>approached that subject, but having taken it up, he in a very great
</p>
<p>hurry dropped it again, totally forgetting to advert to one single cir-
</p>
<p>cumstance connected with it. But, says Mr. Fitzgibbon : " all great
</p>
<p>G80
</p>
<p>" improvements have been effected by a demonstration of physical
</p>
<p>" force ; that Governments would not make a change, unless they
</p>
<p>" saw that the people wished it to be made. Therefore it is, that you
</p>
<p>" put a stop to large masses meeting to express their opinion ; if so,
</p>
<p>" you put an end to all improvement." Does Mr. Fitzgibbon mean
</p>
<p>to justify those proceedings on that ground? if so, I will leave that to
</p>
<p>you to determine. Mr. Fitzgibbon says, that the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>had no right to refer to transactions which took place in 1797, or to
</p>
<p>former prosecutions and proclamations; why they were referred to as
</p>
<p>matters of history, and the traversers themselves referred to similar
</p>
<p>transactions, as such. Mr. Fitzgibbon then says, that his client
</p>
<p>merely interfered with those proceedings as the editor of a news-
</p>
<p>paper, and that he has not lent himself to this conspiracy ; that you
</p>
<p>might as well prosecute the editor of any other newspaper. I mean
</p>
<p>to call your attention not only to those publications of Dr. Gray, but
</p>
<p>to his act3 done in furtherance of this common design, and it will be
</p>
<p>impossible to attribute the conduct adopted by him to anything but a
</p>
<p>participation in this design. He then said, true it is, they have
</p>
<p>used violent language ; but can you expect that men in the heat of a
</p>
<p>debate will conduct themselves with that decorum which is to be ex-
</p>
<p>pected in a Court of justice? my answer to that is, that from the
</p>
<p>length of time this agitation continued, I have a right to say these
</p>
<p>speeches were deliberately made, and these documents deliberately
</p>
<p>drawn up ; and I think you will say that these effusions were not the
</p>
<p>language of men using words which they might afterwards regret,
</p>
<p>but that it was their deliberate sentiment, calculated for the purpose
</p>
<p>of carrying out the objects which they had in view. Next, Mr.
</p>
<p>Fitzgibbon contended, that the offence had merged in the crimeof high
</p>
<p>treason. I do not say, whether if those proceedings had been allowed
</p>
<p>to go on, they might not have come to that which would have war-
</p>
<p>ranted an indictment for the greater offence ; but it was strange to
</p>
<p>expect that we should prosecute for high treason, when we deemed
</p>
<p>that their conduct amounted to a misdemeanor. He then says, in
</p>
<p>excuse for some observations made by Mr. O'Connell, in reference to
</p>

</p>
<p>the army, that his object was to make the people fond of the army.
</p>
<p>When I come to examine the language of Mr. O'Connell, you will
</p>
<p>see whether his object was to make them fond of the army, when, in
</p>
<p>consequence of these meetings, it was deemed necessary to have a
</p>
<p>large number of the army in this country to prevent an outbreak,
</p>
<p>which was perfectly feasible and practicable at a moment's warning.
</p>
<p>He then adverted to the use of the word " Saxon," and asked why
</p>
<p>should its application offend? Was it not true that they had sprung
</p>
<p>from a Saxon origin? That entirely is true; but I think you will
</p>
<p>have no doubt that the reason why this was resorted to was, to excite
</p>
<p>a feeling of hostility against the English people as strangers, invaders,
</p>
<p>and conquerors. Mr. Fitzgibbon then read the speeches of Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell denouncing physical force. Why, if he repeated that one
</p>
<p>thousand times it would not affect this case. What he meant by re-
</p>
<p>681
</p>
<p>sorting to this species of topic I know not ; I shall not detain you by
</p>
<p>commenting on them. He then said that Mr. O'Connell had shown
</p>
<p>an aversion to Chartism and Ribbonism. I admit it, and for the best
</p>
<p>reason  because the existence of Chartism or Ribbonism, or any other
</p>
<p>kind of machinery, would be fatal to his scheme. His object was
</p>
<p>this  present tranquillity, present obedience to the law, perfect or-
</p>
<p>ganization, and constant agitation, the spirit of hostility to be pre-
</p>
<p>served and kept up, but no present violation of the law, so as to place
</p>
<p>them within the fangs of the law, and thereby deprive them of the
</p>
<p>machinery necessary for success. He then says, that the language
</p>
<p>used in reference to the army is not addressed to the soldiers. That
</p>
<p>would be all very well, if the language was not to be circulated through
</p>
<p>the country ; but you will not fail to remember, that one of the modes
</p>
<p>by which the object of the traversers was to be effected was the circu-
</p>
<p>lation of that very language through the country ; they, therefore,
</p>
<p>must have been read by, and communicated to, the soldiers. One of
</p>
<p>the traversers said, in an article in his paper, that it was a cruel thing
</p>
<p>that the soldiers should not be allowed to read the newspapers. It
</p>
<p>was clear then that he meant that they should have this language
</p>
<p>conveyed to them. This suggests to me another ground why they
</p>
<p>thought it necessary to enforce a present obedience to the law. You
</p>
<p>will find that their great object was to collect as many persons as pos-
</p>
<p>sible together, and to enrol them in this Association ; that could only
</p>
<p>be done by personal contact, through agents and emissaries from the
</p>
<p>Association. It would never do to have them committing riot and
</p>
<p>disturbance. It was necessary that this scheme should have time to
</p>
<p>work, that the Repeal Wardens should have an opportunity of enroll-
</p>
<p>ing the people, to have them ready, to have instructions circulated ;
</p>
<p>so that when the time should arrive, there should be no difficulty in
</p>
<p>convening them for any purpose, legal or otherwise, which might be
</p>
<p>in contemplation. Mr. Fitzgibbon then said, that Mr. O'Connell ad-
</p>
<p>vised the people not to enter into correspondence with the army. He
</p>
<p>did so, because, if he had not done so, they would have fallen into
</p>
<p>the error, which it was his object to avoid. That would have been a

</p>
<p>breach of the law, for by the 37 Geo. III. c. 40, made perpetual by
</p>
<p>the 57 Geo. III. c. 7, it is made a transportable offence to tamper
</p>
<p>with the army ; and, therefore, to enter into a correspondence with
</p>
<p>the soldiers would have been a dangerous proceeding.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, Mr. Whiteside next addressed you, and
</p>
<p>I certainly never heard a more splendid exhibition of eloquence than
</p>
<p>my learned friend displayed. It did honour to him and the Profes-
</p>
<p>sion to which he belongs, and, indeed, I may say to this country.
</p>
<p>I certainly listened to him with pleasure, for his speech was charac-
</p>
<p>terized by a tone of perfect good feeling. He attempted to do,
</p>
<p>what was the only thing that could be attempted with any hope of
</p>
<p>success. He endeavoured to divert your attention from the merits of
</p>
<p>the case, and to raise a laugh. He did profess to argue some points
</p>
<p>applicable to the merits, and left you to imagine the rest. He stated
</p>
<p>that Mr. Duffy was no more than the editor of a newspaper, and that
</p>
<p>4s
</p>
<p>G82
</p>
<p>what he did, lie did in the legitimate exercise of his profession. All
</p>
<p>this is very well as matter of argument, but 1 must beg leave to differ
</p>
<p>from him when he says that Mr. Duffy appears on his trial in no
</p>
<p>other character than the editor of a newspaper. The Nation appears
</p>
<p>to have been established in November, 1842. You will bear in mind
</p>
<p>that the strength of the case for the Crown depends upon the acts of
</p>
<p>the parties done subsequent to that period. Gentlemen, I do not
</p>
<p>know whether you have read many numbers of that paper, but there
</p>
<p>appears, from the portions of it that have been read, enough to war-
</p>
<p>rant me in saying, that it was set up for the purpose of advocating
</p>
<p>and disseminating the sentiments and opinions of the Association.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside says, " you might as well have indicted any other
</p>
<p>" editors of newspapers, as his client, because you did not show a
</p>
<p>" community of purpose." Why, that is the very question you are
</p>
<p>to try. I say we have shown a community of purpose, and I evi-
</p>
<p>dence that community of purpose by the acts of each of those
</p>
<p>persons, of Duffy, of Barrett, and of Gray ; we shall show that these
</p>
<p>men embarked in the plan ; that they assisted in the prosecution of
</p>
<p>it ; and if we show that, they are as guilty in point of law of conspi-
</p>
<p>racy as if they had assisted at the commencing and forming of it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside referred to the case of Redford v. Birley, to show
</p>
<p>that there was no ground for the prosecution in this case, by reason
</p>
<p>of the conduct of the parties at the meetings, but in page 105 of that
</p>
<p>case it is said by Judge Holroyd: " If the object of the drilling is to
</p>
<p>" secure the attention of the persons drilled, to disaffected speeches,
</p>
<p>" and give conBdence, by an appearance of strength, to those will-
</p>
<p>" ing to join them, that would be illegal ; or if they were to say,
</p>
<p>" ' we will have what we want, whether it is agreeable to law or not;'
</p>
<p>" a meeting for that purpose, however it may be masked, if it is really
</p>
<p>" for a purpose of that kind, would be illegal." Mr. Whiteside also re-
</p>
<p>ferred to Hunt's case, and he read the circumstances of that case, for
</p>
<p>the purpose of contrasting it with the present case, as showing that it
</p>
<p>was one in which the jury acquitted the party of the charge of con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, but every fact in that case shows that the meeting was illegal

</p>
<p>in itself, and so far from furnishing an argument in support of his
</p>
<p>view of the case, it shows quite the contrary. He says that the lega-
</p>
<p>lity or illegality of those meetings is not to be judged of by the num-
</p>
<p>bers which attended them, and he went in detail through all those
</p>
<p>meetings which had taken place at Manchester and elsewhere, and
</p>
<p>contended that if they were illegal they should not have been allowed ;
</p>
<p>but our's is not the case of a single meering, but of a series of meet-
</p>
<p>ings for a common object.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside said that Mr. O'Connell need not have taken notice
</p>
<p>of the speech of Sir Robert Peel ; but he did take notice of it, and you
</p>
<p>will see whether he did so with the object of doing what we charge
</p>
<p>he had in view  misleading the people assembled at those meetings
</p>
<p>with regard to the intention of the Sovereign and the law of the land.
</p>
<p>He then adverted to a topic which I do not think belonged to
</p>
<p>the case, he alluded to the provisions of the Party Processions Act,
</p>
<p>683
</p>
<p>2 & 3 Will. IV. c. 118, and said that the provisions of that Statute
</p>
<p>applied exclusively to the Orangemen. Gentlemen, there is no-
</p>
<p>thing on the face of that Act to warrant that allegation ; that it is not
</p>
<p>generally applicable to all cases of assemblies of this nature. He
</p>
<p>then alluded to the opinions of men in Parliament at the time the
</p>
<p>Union was passed, to the effect, that they doubted whether posterity
</p>
<p>would validate the Act. If he means that they are at liberty to re-
</p>
<p>sist by force or illegal means, I deny that proposition ; if by legal
</p>
<p>means, 1 fully admit it. Mr. "Whiteside alluded to the trial in
</p>
<p>Hardy's case, 24 State Trials, 1048. In that case a letter from the
</p>
<p>Duke of Richmond was proved, in which this passage occurred :
</p>
<p>" Before 1 conclude, I beg leave to express a wish that the mutu-
</p>
<p>" ally essential connexion between Great Britain and Ireland may
</p>
<p>" soon be settled on some liberal and fair footing. That which did
</p>
<p>" subsist was on such narrow and absurd principles, that no friend of
</p>
<p>" either kingdom can regret its loss; formed on constraint and de-
</p>
<p>" pendence, incompatible with the condition of freemen, Ireland had
</p>
<p>" an indisputable right to dissolve it whenever she chose so to do.
</p>
<p>" But surely, if we do not mean a total separation, it would be right
</p>
<p>" to agree upon some new terms by which we are to continue con-
</p>
<p>" nected. 1 have always thought it for the interest of the two islands
</p>
<p>" to be incorporated and form one and the same kingdom, with the
</p>
<p>" same Legislature, meeting sometimes in Ireland as well as in Eng-
</p>
<p>" land. But if there are difficulties to such a union not to be got
</p>
<p>" over at present, some sort of Federal Union at least between the
</p>
<p>" two kingdoms seems necessary, to ascertain the many circum-
</p>
<p>" stances that concern their joint interests; and an union of this
</p>
<p>" sort may now be formed with much greater propriety than before,
</p>
<p>" as it will be sanctified by the free consent of independent nations."
</p>
<p>So much was read by Mr. Whiteside ; but in the latter part of the
</p>
<p>letter you will find he says: " 1 do conceive that some step of this
</p>
<p>" sort is absolutely necessary, because the present footing of separa-
</p>
<p>" tion, rather than union, is too unfair to be able long to subsist.

<p>" of both kingdoms, bears all the burdens of naval defence and foreign
</p>
<p>" negotiations, and by far more than its proportion of the land ser-
</p>

</p>
<p>" the same King, in his different kingdoms, may think it wise to
</p>
<p>" follow the advice of his respective Parliaments. I need scarcely
</p>
<p>" add, that the unavoidable consequences of such a difference are a

</p>

</p>
<p>is the view of that nobleman as to the consequences of a sepa-
</p>
<p>084
</p>
<p>rate Legislatuie. I may have to advert to this more fully hereafter,
</p>
<p>when I come to what I may call my case. I am now merely an-
</p>
<p>swering the topics that have been thrown out by the traversers'
</p>
<p>counsel. When called on to decide whether the Union ought to be
</p>
<p>repealed or not, these circumstances may be proper to consider; but
</p>
<p>this is not the question that you have to try, although Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>may think so. I come now to the case cited by Mr. Whiteside, Rex
</p>
<p>v. Reeves, 1 Peake, Add. Cases, 84. That was an information filed
</p>
<p>for a libel. That libel was certainly a very gross one ; no less than
</p>
<p>this : that it was competent for the Crown to make laws without the
</p>
<p>intervention of the Houses of Parliament at all. The House of Com-
</p>
<p>mons voted that to be a seditious libel, and that it ought to be prose-
</p>
<p>cuted. It was, however, relied upon that the book was published for
</p>
<p>a good purpose and with a good intent, and the jury who tried the
</p>
<p>case acquitted the defendant. The jury acquitted him, because in an
</p>
<p>indictment for a libel, the question is whether the party published
</p>
<p>the libel with a bad intent, and the jury must believe and be satis-
</p>
<p>fied that it was published with that intention ; but if they believe that
</p>
<p>the man acted with an honest though mistaken view, they ought
</p>
<p>not to convict him. But what bearing can that have upon a question
</p>
<p>of this kind ? We admit that the guilt depends upon the intention
</p>
<p>of the parties : but that is to be demonstrated by the acts and decla-
</p>
<p>rations of the parties themselves, not by reference to books, or to the
</p>
<p>acts of others.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I now come to make a few remarks upon what was
</p>
<p>stated by Mr. Henn. He told you that he was unexpectedly called
</p>
<p>on to address you, and I believe that to be quite true. I suspect it
</p>
<p>was felt, that up to that time, that there had not been a satisfactory
</p>
<p>explanation given of the main features of the case, or any plausi-
</p>
<p>ble solution of the designs of the parties who were charged with this
</p>
<p>conspiracy, or of the offence with which they were charged, and
</p>
<p>accordingly Mr. Henn was called on to buckle on his armour at the
</p>
<p>eleventh hour ; and certainly it showed very great discretion on the
</p>
<p>part of the traversers to call on him to do so. But when you come

</p>
<p>to consider what was relied on by Mr. Henn, it is nothing more or
</p>
<p>less than this : a sophistical repetition of certain arguments which
</p>
<p>had been brought forward before, and which it was thought could
</p>
<p>not be safely relied on, as they stood, before the Court and the jury.
</p>
<p>His argument was this: " I admit, in the fullest sense of the word,
</p>
<p>" that the act of one party is evidence against the other, if they
</p>
<p>" have embarked in the prosecution of any crime or unlawful pur-
</p>
<p>" pose, because all were engaged in an illegal object; but if the pur-
</p>
<p>" pose of the parties is legal, then it is most unjustifiable that the act
</p>
<p>" of one should be made evidence against all, because all were en-
</p>
<p>" gaged in a legal object; but when the object is for a constitutional
</p>
<p>M purpose, it is monstrous to say, that you will infer, for instance,
</p>
<p>" that what is said or done by Mr. Duffy or Mr. O'Connell, that that
</p>
<p>" is to be relied on as evidence against the other traversers, that is
</p>
<p>" what is attempted to be done here. I admit, and candidly avow,"
</p>
<p>he says, " that the object of my client, and the other traversers, was
</p>
<p>G85
</p>
<p>" to attain a Repeal of the Union; I must concede they had that
</p>
<p>" common object, but that was a legal object, and therefore to say
</p>
<p>" that what Mr. O'Connell said, or what Mr. Duffy or Mr. Barrett
</p>
<p>" published, should be relied on as evidence against the others, is un-
</p>
<p>" fair and unjust." Now this is all very plausible ; but unfortunately it
</p>
<p>involves in it the assumption of the very question you are called upon
</p>
<p>to decide. I do admit, that the common object of those parties was,
</p>
<p>to obtain a Repeal of the Union ; but I say, that they had a further
</p>
<p>and ultimate object in view of attaining it, not by the use of legal
</p>
<p>and constitutional means, but that they sought to obtain it by those
</p>
<p>illegal means charged in the indictment. We are not trying whe-
</p>
<p>ther they had a common design to obtain a Repeal of the Union.
</p>
<p>It is notorious that there are many joined with them who have that
</p>
<p>in view. For that alone, they could not be prosecuted ; they
</p>
<p>may combine by legal means to further that object, but they are
</p>
<p>charged with attempting to procure it by intimidation, and the other
</p>
<p>means charged in the indictment ; and I hope that the jury will un-
</p>
<p>derstand that the Crown are not prosecuting the traversers for any
</p>
<p>but an unlawful purpose. Mr. Henn stated, that the charge of ex-
</p>
<p>citing discontent and disaffection was very vague and very general ;
</p>
<p>it follows the precedent, Regina v. Vincent, 9 C. & P. 275 ; and
</p>
<p>the eighth plea in Redford v. Birley. In the case of Regina v.
</p>
<p>Vincent, the defendants were found guilty; and in Regina v.
</p>
<p>Shelford,9 C. & P. 277, which was an indictment like the present,
</p>
<p>the defendants were also found guilty.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin.  In Regina v. O'Connor, cited by
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside, Baron Rolfe appears to treat that case as too ge-
</p>
<p>neral.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  That case was reported by the
</p>
<p>defendant himself ; and I do not think we can receive it as an autho-
</p>
<p>rity.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, hitherto I have not been submitting to you what I
</p>
<p>call the strength of the case in this prosecution. I have so far con-
</p>
<p>fined myself to the topics used by the traversers' counsel, irrelevant

</p>
<p>to the merits, excusable enough introduced in the absence of better
</p>
<p>material, but which might have the effect of preventing your having a
</p>
<p>clear view of what you have to try, for until you know what the real
</p>
<p>question is, it is impossible to know the bearing of the evidence on it,
</p>
<p>and until the case is divested of an immense quantity of extraneous
</p>
<p>matter which had been heaped upon it. It is necessary that I should
</p>
<p>call your attention specifically to this indictment. [The Solicitor-
</p>
<p>General here read the first count of the indictment]. I have already
</p>
<p>touched upon the subject to which I am now about to call your at-
</p>
<p>tention, namely, the alleged necessity of the conspiracy having com-
</p>
<p>prised all the objects. Upon this you will receive the direction of
</p>
<p>the Court, and of course you will act upon that direction. Now it is
</p>
<p>the nature of every criminal charge, that although you may lay the
</p>
<p>offence more extensively than the evidence is found to support, yet
</p>
<p>if enough be proved to show the existence of what is in law a
</p>
<p>criminal offence, it is your duty to convict upon so much of the charge.
</p>
<p>686
</p>
<p>1 shall refer your Lordships to some authorities upon this principle. In
</p>
<p>Rex v. Hollinbury, 4 B. & C. 3'29. There the defendants were in-
</p>
<p>" dieted for conspiring falsely to indict one A. B., for keeping a
</p>
<p>" gaming house, for the purpose of extorting money from A. B.
</p>
<p>" The jury found the defendant guilty of conspiring to indict A.B.,
</p>
<p>" for the purpose of extorting money, but not to indict him falsely,
</p>
<p>" and on motion for a new trial the Court said : In criminal
</p>
<p>" cases, it is sufficient for the prosecutor to prove so much of the
</p>
<p>" charge as constitutes an offence punishable by law. This was an
</p>
<p>" indictment for conspiring falsely to indict a person for the pur-
</p>
<p>" pose of extorting money. The jury found the defendants guilty of
</p>
<p>" conspiring to prefer an indictment for the purpose of extorting
</p>
<p>" money, and that is a misdemeanor, whether the charge be or be
</p>
<p>" not false." That shows that even upon a single count laying a
</p>
<p>single conspiracy, that though it was not proved exactly in the form
</p>
<p>and manner in which it was charged, nevertheless if there be suf-
</p>
<p>ficient to amount to a criminal offence, the indictment is proved.
</p>
<p>The next case I shall call your attention to is Rex v. Hunt, 2
</p>
<p>Camp. 583. That was an indictment for printing and publishing a
</p>
<p>libel. The only proof was the proof of publication, and Lord Ellen-
</p>
<p>borough said : " it was invariably enough to prove so much of the
</p>
<p>" indictment, as shows that the defendant has committed the sub-
</p>
<p>" stantive crime specified in it." The same principle is recognized in
</p>
<p>Rex v. Dawson, 2 Stark. 64. I state these authorities to show you
</p>
<p>what you have to try is this : are the objects of the conspiracy
</p>
<p>proved ? Is one of them, or more than one of them proved ? If
</p>
<p>so, then it is your duty to convict, though you are not satisfied
</p>
<p>that all were proved. I intend to submit, and I have not the slight-
</p>
<p>est doubt I shall be able to establish, that every one of those acts
</p>
<p>has been as clearly proved as anything that ever came before a
</p>
<p>jury. But I am anxious to guard against every mistake, as to the
</p>
<p>duty of a jury in deciding upon an indictment, as if the question was
</p>
<p>not whether there was any evidence, but whether there was evi-
</p>
<p>dence as to all the charges. Again, there are several traversers. If

</p>
<p>six of them be guilty, you ought to convict them, if there be four,
</p>
<p>you should only convict them, it is not necessary that you should be-
</p>
<p>lieve them all to be guilty.
</p>
<p>Having made these observations upon what the law is, and having
</p>
<p>discussed the merits of this case, I shall now proceed to what I shall
</p>
<p>call the history of the case, and the details of the evidence upon which
</p>
<p>we rely in support of this present prosecution ; and I am very much
</p>
<p>mistaken if you will not see in the history and progress of that evi-
</p>
<p>dence, the most convincing proof that the traversers entertained the
</p>
<p>common design of endeavouring to effect the object which they admit
</p>
<p>they have; to effect that by the use of those unconstitutional and un-
</p>
<p>lawful means which are stated in this indictment, to each of which I
</p>
<p>mean toapply the particularevidence that supports it. There is nodoubt
</p>
<p>that this conspiracy which we say existed between the traversers and
</p>
<p>others, is more or less connected with the heads of the Repeal Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation. It is through the medium of their connexion with this bodv 
</p>
<p>G87
</p>
<p>llieir respective execution of its behests  their participation in its
</p>
<p>proceedings, and their common combination for effecting the designs
</p>
<p>of it. It is in this way, and for this purpose the conspiracy was
</p>
<p>formed. The " Loyal National Repeal Association" appears to have
</p>
<p>originated, so far as the evidence goes, in July, 1840. It was at first
</p>
<p>called the " National Repeal Association ;" it shortly after added
</p>
<p>the name Loyal. I am not now going to argue that they had not a
</p>
<p>right to give it any name they pleased; nor am I going to ar-
</p>
<p>gue against the abstract right of forming an Association for the
</p>
<p>legal purpose of procuring the redress of any grievance, or the
</p>
<p>correction of any abuse. I therefore am not saying that in 1840
</p>
<p>for aught that appears, that the mere constitution of this Associ-
</p>
<p>ation was a violation of the law. The evidence does not autho-
</p>
<p>rize me to go that length ; but I think that no man who heard the
</p>
<p>evidence, not merely the evidence for the Crown, but the evidence
</p>
<p>for the traversers, can entertain a doubt, that whatever may have been
</p>
<p>the real object of that body of persons when first established in 1840,
</p>
<p>in the year 1843, and early in that year, the purposes which they
</p>
<p>had in view became illegal, and supposing them to have been within
</p>
<p>the pale of the law up to that period, their conduct afterwards de-
</p>
<p>monstrated that they were actuated by the motives which we have
</p>
<p>ascribed to the participators by the indictment ; and that the traver-
</p>
<p>sers were each and every of them participators in these motives.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I have already remarked that the Nation newspaper was
</p>
<p>set up in November, 1842. Now, have you remarked that the great
</p>
<p>bulk of the evidence which the traversers have brought forward  I
</p>
<p>mean the speeches and proceedings of this body  had reference to
</p>
<p>the years 1841 and 1842. I do not mean to say that Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>or any other member of the Society, was guilty of a violation of the
</p>
<p>law in making those speeches. But what is the fact with regard to
</p>
<p>the present nature and the present constitution of this Association,
</p>
<p>which bears the same name as the Association which was formed in
</p>
<p>1840, but which has been reconstructed and remodelled at a subse-
</p>
<p>quent period. We have not been informed by those persons who

</p>
<p>had the evidence in their power what the objects of the Association
</p>
<p>were in 1841 and 1842. We do not know them, and when I con-
</p>
<p>fess them to be legal, I make that confession through ignorance
</p>
<p>of the facts. However, you will see there was an organization of that
</p>
<p>Association, and its affiliated bodies, most carefully constructed and
</p>
<p>carried on in a manner which demonstrated what was the object of the
</p>
<p>parties who assisted in its organization.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you have heard generally of the nature of this Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation, so far as relates to its members and officers. You have be-
</p>
<p>fore you the Associates' card, which issued for the purpose of en-
</p>
<p>rolling in the body persons who contributed one shilling. Mr.
</p>
<p>O'ConnelPs plan was: " Give me three millions of Repealers, and I
</p>
<p>will undertake to procure a Repeal of the Union." One mode, ac-
</p>
<p>cording to the plan of the Association, is a subscription of one shil-
</p>
<p>ling, and the Associate is then entitled to a card to show that he is
</p>
<p>enrolled as a Repealer. Here, in passing, I may observe on one of
</p>
<p>the topics relied on by the counsel for Mr. Barrett, that he was not a
</p>
<p>G88
</p>
<p>member of the Association. Whether he was or was not a memher
</p>
<p>is not material to the present indictment, because it is not for being
</p>
<p>members of this Association they are prosecuted, but for co-operating
</p>
<p>for certain purposes; because, whether a member of the body or not,
</p>
<p>he, by so doing, would be guilty of the charge in this indictment. But
</p>
<p>before he is entitled to credit for the assertion that he is not a mem-
</p>
<p>ber of the Association, I will call on you to recollect that, by the consti-
</p>
<p>tution of the Association, every member must be enrolled, it was, there-
</p>
<p>fore, competent for Mr. Barrett to prove that he was not a member; but
</p>
<p>when it is alleged as a matter of fact, with a view of producing some
</p>
<p>effect on your verdict, I must call your attention to this, that proof
</p>
<p>of that fact was in their power, and they did not give it. The next
</p>
<p>order of this Association were Members, who are entitled to a differ-
</p>
<p>ent species of card upon collecting or producing asubscription to a cer-
</p>
<p>tain amount. Now, I said I thought I could satisfy you, both as to
</p>
<p>the nature of this Association and the means used by the persons
</p>
<p>engaged in the prosecution of this design, and what their objects were.
</p>
<p>This Members' card you will have before you. Now, I beg leave to
</p>
<p>call your attention to the nature of this card, and why it was this spe-
</p>
<p>cies of emblem, and why these particular inscriptions on it were se-
</p>
<p>lected. You will find, on reference to each side of it, that it contains
</p>
<p>places where battles were fought in which the Irish were successful ;
</p>
<p>and you will also find on it a reference to certain states of Europe
</p>
<p>which were independent States, with separate Governments, separate
</p>
<p>kingdoms, and the population of which is contrasted with the population
</p>
<p>of Ireland. Such, Gentlemen, is one of the cards of union belonging
</p>
<p>to this Association so connected. Allow me to recall to your recol-
</p>
<p>lection a material document, which, in common with every other ma-
</p>
<p>terial piece of evidence which was proved on the part of the Crown,
</p>
<p>they were wholly silent about ; it is a letter written to the Se-
</p>
<p>cretary of the Loyal National Repeal Association, explanatory of this
</p>
<p>new card for Members. What does that import ? Does it not speak
</p>
<p>trumpet-tongued, that something was to be effected through the me-
</p>
<p>dium of that card, something not contemplated by the Association.

<p>I do not care if the traversers were to spend four weeks more in ex-
</p>
<p>planation of their conduct in 1840, '41, and '42. I call upon them
</p>
<p>to meet the charge, commencing here in 1843, which they have not
</p>
<p>attempted to do, nor do I believe they could do. This letter is
</p>
<p>written by the author of the " Green Book," it bears date the 11th
</p>
<p>of April, 1843, and was proved by Browne. The reading of it was
</p>
<p>received with acclamation at the meeting of the Association,
</p>
<p>and it was enrolled on the minutes on the motion of Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell. It is headed "Nation Office," and signed "J. C. O'Cal-
</p>
<p>laghan. Upon this subject I would observe, that this letter
</p>
<p>was entered on the minutes and ordered to be generally circu-
</p>
<p>lated, and this card would not be issued to any person who did not
</p>
<p>procure or pay a subscription of 10. One of the objects of this let-
</p>
<p>ter was, to excite confidence in the people in their own strength, and
</p>
<p>ill-will against the Saxon, as our English fellow-subjects are called.
</p>
<p>The writer having stated the object and design of that card, refers to
</p>
<p>a part of it in which a reference is made to Mr. Saurin's speech against
</p>
<p>G89
</p>
<p>the Union, he says: " The force of such an opinion against the vali-
</p>
<p>" dity of the Union, as that of the Tory or Orange Attorney-Gene-
</p>
<p>" ral of Ireland for so many years, needs no comment." This is for
</p>
<p>the purpose of having it believed, that it was the opinion of the then
</p>
<p>Attorney-General, that the Act of Union was not valid. I will come
</p>
<p>by-and-by to the miserable subterfuge by which it was attempted to
</p>
<p>explain away that. He then gives a detail of the population of various
</p>
<p>Continental countries compared with Ireland, and says, " Ireland has
</p>
<p>not a Parliament," and describes various victories which had been
</p>
<p>won by the Irish. [See ante, p. 215, where this letter is fully set out.]
</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen, if I had not this document, and were to take the
</p>
<p>card and draw the comments which the writer had made on its con-
</p>
<p>tents, it might be said that I was straining a point ; but here we have
</p>
<p>the act of the Association itself explaining the document, and directly
</p>
<p>stating what its objects and what its meaning were, by moral force 
</p>
<p>moral combination ! Is this the mode of collecting together a moral
</p>
<p>force ? It is absurd to assert that it is capable of that meaning ; in the
</p>
<p>first place they could not do so, and in the second place, if they did,
</p>
<p>it would contradict the act of the Association. I suppose it will be
</p>
<p>contended, that those victories referred to were bloodless victories 
</p>
<p>the victories of public opinion, of reason and intellect over prejudice ;
</p>
<p>but, Gentlemen, it is for you to say, whether that explanation will
</p>
<p>satisfy the meaning of it. The writer further says: " The object of
</p>
<p>" the heathen Danes, who, at this period, determined to makeup for
</p>
<p>" the failure of their constant attempts, during above 200 years, to
</p>
<p>M conquer Ireland, bears too strong a resemblance to the subsequent
</p>
<p>" conduct of another country towards us, not to be mentioned. They
</p>
<p>" 'invaded,' says a cotemporary French chronicler, ' with an innume-
</p>
<p>" 'rable fleet, and accompanied by their wives, their children, and
</p>
<p>"  their Christian captives, whom they reduced to be their slaves,
</p>
<p>" ' the island Hibernia, likewise called Irlanda, in order that, the
</p>
<p>" ' Irish being exterminated, they might colonize that most opulent
</p>
<p>" ' country for themselves.' " The words, " pushing a pike," were
</p>
<p>also quoted in inverted commas ; where they were taken from, I do

</p>
<p>not profess to say, but the reference was made to victories gained by
</p>
<p>the Irish by "pushing the pike" against the rebels. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>the next document is the Volunteers' Card. This machinery ap-
</p>
<p>pears to have been constructed with a view to the proceedings of
</p>
<p>the Volunteers in 1782, and I think you will find the real design was
</p>
<p>concealed under pretext of founding the steps that were to be adopt-
</p>
<p>ed in the prosecution of that design, upon something like the prece-
</p>
<p>dent and legal authority of that Association. A resolution similar to
</p>
<p>one of that Association and a card, is given to a person who contri-
</p>
<p>butes 20, and this is called the " Volunteers' Card.'' This card is
</p>
<p>embellished with a likeness of Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Grattan, and Mr.
</p>
<p>Flood, and two other persons, in reference to whom Mr. Whiteside
</p>
<p>was particularly facetious. He alluded to Ollam Fodhla and King
</p>
<p>Dathi, but he overlooked Sarsfield, the O'Neills, and Brian Bo-
</p>
<p>roihme. You will recollect that Brian Boroihme was the Irish King
</p>
<p>at the battle of Clontarf, the description of which was contained in Mr.
</p>
<p>4T
</p>
<p>690
</p>
<p>O'Callaghan's letter. Sarsfield was also passed by in silence, be-
</p>
<p>cause it was plain the intention was to keep before the minds of
</p>
<p>the Irish people the former victories in which they were success-
</p>
<p>ful by physical force against foreign invaders. Now I do not pre-
</p>
<p>tend to be able to tell what the duties may have been of those to
</p>
<p>whom those cards were given. I do not know, nor does it appear
</p>
<p>upon the card what they were required or bound to do. I do not
</p>
<p>know what were the whole of the duties of the Repeal Wardens,
</p>
<p>the confidential and accredited officers and emissaries of this bo-
</p>
<p>dy. All I know is this, that by means of them it was found pos-
</p>
<p>sible to collect together, at the bidding of a single person, any num-
</p>
<p>ber of persons at any particular place, from any distance almost, how-
</p>
<p>ever remote.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I think I should not be able to convey to you a dis-
</p>
<p>tinct or intelligible view of the true character or nature of this con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, without taking you in some certain and determinate order,
</p>
<p>and I shall be able to do this by taking them in their chronological
</p>
<p>order, then according to the different charges contained in the in-
</p>
<p>dictment. The first part of the evidence to which I shall advert is
</p>
<p>the Pilot newspaper, of the 10th of March, 1843, having reference to
</p>
<p>Mr. Tyler's speech in America. 1 would call your attention par-
</p>
<p>ticularly to the dates of these transactions, the period when those
</p>
<p>cards were issued, the date of those letters and speeches, and the other
</p>
<p>documents; and looking at all together you will see whether they do
</p>
<p>not develope a regularly organized plan and scheme of attaining the
</p>
<p>Repeal of the Legislative Union, by the exhibition of physical force ;
</p>
<p>by attempting to create disaffection in the army ; by sowing discon-
</p>
<p>tent and disaffection amongst different classes of people in this coun-
</p>
<p>try, and by the several other means charged in this indictment. Mr.
</p>
<p>Tyler, the President's son, made a speech in America, and com-
</p>
<p>mented on the question of the Repeal of the Union ; amongst
</p>
<p>other things he said : " That he had, through the medium of re-
</p>
<p>f spected relatives, become acquainted with the character of some
</p>
<p>' k of the sons of Ireland, who were driven from their homes by un-

</p>
<p>" just judges and unjust juries in the struggle of Ireland for her in-
</p>
<p>" deepndance in 1798, and that they had sought and found an asylum
</p>
<p>" in that land of freedom, America." Mr. Tyler went on to speak
</p>
<p>about the oppression under which Ireland suffered, and concluded
</p>
<p>by stating " that the libations to freedom must sometimes be quaffed
</p>
<p>in blood."
</p>
<p>Now, let us see how that speech was commented upon by Mr.
</p>
<p>Barrett, in the Pilot of the 10th of March. After some other ob-
</p>
<p>servations, Mr. Barrett called " the attention of Her Majesty's Go-
</p>
<p>" vernment to the fact, that the son of the President of the United
</p>
<p>" States of America, who took a leading part in the meeting held
</p>
<p>" there, moved the first resolution ; that he delivered a bold and
</p>
<p>" statesmanlike speech upon the occasion ; that the young gentle-
</p>
<p>" man was secretary to his father; and that he was, of course, the
</p>
<p>" representative and expounder of his father's views and opinions.
</p>
<p>" Let it be recollected," said he, " that the President of the United
</p>
<p>691
</p>
<p>" States of America was a Repealer of the Union, and here was his
</p>
<p>" son and secretary, with Members of Congress, gathered round the
</p>
<p>" green standard of Ireland and Repeal. The United States were
</p>
<p>" studded all over with Repeal Associations ; they were about to bind
</p>
<p>" themselves together by means of executive bodies, which should
</p>
<p>" never be dissolved until Ireland was again restored to her libeity."
</p>
<p>Am I not therefore well warranted in stating that at this time Mr. Bar-
</p>
<p>rett entertained the opinion, and circulated it through the medium
</p>
<p>of his newspaper, that the United States of America were in such a
</p>
<p>condition, that it would be unsafe for the Government or for the
</p>
<p>Ministry of England to refuse compliance with the demands made
</p>
<p>by the Repeal Association? Is not that evidence of attempting to
</p>
<p>intimidate the Government ? Does it not support the charge, this
</p>
<p>first document which I produce ? There have been no observations
</p>
<p>offered upon it ; no explanation given of it, and am I not right in
</p>
<p>calling on you to give it the meaning it plainly imports ? The ob-
</p>
<p>servations then went on to state, that "America naturally considered
</p>
<p>" that Ireland would be attached to her interests. Ireland is, after
</p>
<p>" all, an important portion or section of the national family. Napo-
</p>
<p>" leon once said that had he landed his Egyptian army in Ireland,
</p>
<p>" and turned it into a republic, he might have altered the destinies of
</p>
<p>"the whole world"  "curious coincidence!" The same state of
</p>
<p>things, which, if Napoleon had taken advantage of by sending his
</p>
<p>army into Ireland, and thereby alter the destinies of the whole world,
</p>
<p>might occur again ! " England may get into war with her neigh-
</p>
<p>bours." " Ireland is an important part of the national family," and
</p>
<p>if England happened to be at war hereafter, persons might be found,
</p>
<p>who would adopt a wiser course, by not sending the armies to Egypt
</p>
<p>but to Ireland; who knows what the result might be? Curious
</p>
<p>coincidence!! That took place on the 10th of March, 1843, and
</p>
<p>there was an article in the Nation, entitled " The Memory of the
</p>
<p>Dead," upon the 1st of April, and you will remark how the actions
</p>
<p>of the different traversers concurrently agreed on the different sub-
</p>
<p>jects. Mr. Barrett in the Pilot, Dr. Gray in the Freeman, and

<p>Mr. Duffy in the Nation, all coincided in their different spheres.
</p>
<p>These lines commence with :
</p>
<p>" Who fears to speak of Ninety-eight ?
</p>
<p>Who blushes at the name ?"
</p>
<p>And yet you are told that there is no meaning in it, and that it was
</p>
<p>only an imitation of the Jacobite songs. It was compared to " The
</p>
<p>Exile of Erin," and other ballads ; and it was said that no person
</p>
<p>could suppose that the mere publication of it showed the slightest
</p>
<p>guilty intention. Mr. Whiteside went even so far as to say, that it
</p>
<p>could not be said even to allude to 1798, as '98 was all that was men-
</p>
<p>tioned ; and it might as well be the year '98 in the first century,
</p>
<p>1698, or 1398, as 1798; but it will be for you to judge what
</p>
<p>was the object of its publication, and what '98 it was intended to
</p>
<p>G92
</p>
<p>allude to. If I were to give Mr. Whiteside the full benefit of his
</p>
<p>commentaries on the facts in question, saying that it was a mere
</p>
<p>effusion indicating a commiseration at the unhappy fate of the
</p>
<p>unhappy men who died in that year, supposing that it was capable
</p>
<p>of such a construction, judging from the first part, who could think
</p>
<p>so when he read another verse :
</p>
<p>" And we will pray that from tbeir clay
</p>
<p>Full many a race will start,
</p>
<p>Of true men, like you, men,
</p>
<p>To act so brave a part."
</p>
<p>Was that commiseration for the unhappy fate of the misguided men,
</p>
<p>or was it likely to encourage the men of the present day to follow
</p>
<p>their example ? How was that rebellion of 1798, which was so elo-
</p>
<p>quently denounced by Mr. O'Connell, characterized by this effusion?
</p>
<p>As " the struggle of right against might" and this was the publication
</p>
<p>of Mr. Duffy, one of the traversers.
</p>
<p>The next document I will refer to, was the Freeman's Jour-
</p>
<p>nal of the 4th of April, 1843, which contained the proceedings
</p>
<p>of a meeting upon the previous day, when it will be seen that
</p>
<p>Mr. Ray read a letter from General Clooney, dated on the 2nd
</p>
<p>of April, 1843, in which he remitted money, and the names of Mem-
</p>
<p>bers, Associates, &c>, which, upon the motion of Mr. O'Connell,
</p>
<p>was ordered to be inserted on the minutes. Then, on the 29th of the
</p>
<p>same month, there appeared an article in the Natioti, headed, " Some-
</p>
<p>thing is coming ," and you will remember that one of the allegations
</p>
<p>of the traversers was, " that their object was to effect a measure 
</p>
<p>" to procure from the Legislature, by peaceable and constitutional
</p>
<p>" means, the Repeal of the Union." Parliament was then sitting,
</p>
<p>and for a long lime after, and what was it that was coming ? Was it
</p>
<p>the discussion of Repeal in the Houses of Parliament they meant ?
</p>
<p>Is it the presenting of a petition for that purpose? I think you will
</p>
<p>not be of that opinion when I call your attention to the topics intro-
</p>
<p>duced into this article. It proceeds thus: " Something is coming;
</p>
<p>" aye, let it be for good or evil, something is coming. Some crisis,

</p>
<p>" seme decided swell or ebb of Ireland's fortune is not far off. The
</p>
<p>" country at leng this roused ; gathering, and darkening, and accumu-
</p>
<p>" lating have its forces been for long, and men said, ' it will be a
</p>
<p>" shower, and 'twill pass away,' but now the masses are suddenly
</p>
<p>" rolling together, and crowding the firmament. The heart of lre-
</p>
<p>" land begins to beat strongly. This is a solemn time for all men who
</p>
<p>" can influence the people." Now, Gentlemen, you will observe that
</p>
<p>uptothis time no declaration had been made in the House of Commons
</p>
<p>by Sir Robert Peel on the question of Repeal, and there was no pre-
</p>
<p>tence, therefore, for saying that this publication could be accounted
</p>
<p>for, or justified by, any expression of opinion in England. Again :
</p>
<p>" Let no man mistake us. We do not wish to discourage the people,
</p>
<p>" but to put them in astate of mind as remote from depression as from
</p>
<p>" frivolous confidence  confidence has no safe basis except in thorough
</p>
<p>" knowledge. We do not bid the people crouch in cowardly woe 
</p>
<p>093
</p>
<p>"wo summon them forth to strain every nerve, to abandon present
</p>
<p>" comfort, to make any sacrifice for liberty, provided they see clearly
</p>
<p>" for what they came forth, and know they are to succeed." I do not
</p>
<p>quarrel with figurative language ; we are noi prosecuting for figurative
</p>
<p>language, but it is for plain, direct speaking. " But we will never
</p>
<p>urge them out with us on the troubled waters, unless we are sure of
</p>
<p>ship and crew, and foresee how we shall weather the gale. We
</p>
<p>repeat, then, that (here are signs and storms abroad, and we wish
</p>
<p>the people to look into the tempest, and measure its strength, and
</p>
<p>prepare to conquer it. Ireland has the means of a present and par-
</p>
<p>tial and of an ultimate and complete success in her own hands, if
</p>
<p>she go on wisely, and, therefore, sternly, coolly, and vigorously to
</p>
<p>work. Let no man believe that they have undertaken a holi-
</p>
<p>day mumming in meeting England's remorseless and subtle des-
</p>
<p>potism. Let us have no bragging or foolhardiness. There has
</p>
<p>been too much of this at all times in Ireland. If we are all
</p>
<p>that we are apt to call ourselves, how comes it that millions of
</p>
<p>our population often want a second meal ? And why have we failed
</p>
<p>to loosen or smash England's cruel and wasting gripe of us ? No !
</p>
<p>no ! The Irish have great genius and courage, but they require to
</p>
<p>educate and steady themselves into that foresight and perseverance
</p>
<p>which win campaigns as well as battles in politics or war. Let us look
</p>
<p>about us for the elements of success ; let us throw away no re-
</p>
<p>sources, offend no ally, arouse no neutral, and abandon no strong
</p>
<p>position. We have the opportunity and the means themselves to
</p>
<p>our hands. America is more unanimous in its friendship and more
</p>
<p>powerful in its means than in 1829. Let America be told the whole
</p>
<p>truth of our position, and she will do her best. We can promise
</p>
<p>for some of the ablest and greatest in France. The French people
</p>
<p>long to serve us. England is in distress. Her finances are in dif-
</p>
<p>ficulty. Her colonial empire  India, the Cape, China, Canada,
</p>
<p>&c.,make such a demand on her, that out of 103 battalions, which
</p>
<p>constitute her infantry of the line, 80 are abroad, and only 23 in
</p>
<p>the three kingdoms. And unless the late blows received from Por-

<p>tugal and Brazil tend to keep her up against the staggering shocks
</p>
<p>without, and the huge cancer of aristocracy w : ithin, her pecuniary
</p>
<p>resources will diminish as the demand for them increases." This is
</p>
<p>to show them that England could not resist an outbreak ; the utmost
</p>
<p>she could do would be to maintain her own empire ; and that they
</p>
<p>" must be successful when England was so crippled. What, then, is
</p>
<p>" necessary ? Exertion, coolness, patience, and courage. The peo-
</p>
<p>" pie of Ireland are now more sober and orderly, though not more
</p>
<p>" excited, than in some of their former movements. Let them endea-
</p>
<p>" vour to get more order and more intelligence ; let them do and pre-
</p>
<p>" pare more than hitherto ; let them be kind, conciliatory, and forgiv-
</p>
<p>" ing, to such of the Protestants as have not yet joined." How often
</p>
<p>have you been told that there is nothing sectarian in this proceed-
</p>
<p>ing ; that the difference of religious creed is not to interpose. Why
</p>
<p>694
</p>
<p>they are not charged with fomenting ill-will against the Protestants,
</p>
<p>but against the English ; and what answer is that to the charge ? It
</p>
<p>shows that they are adopting this conciliatory proceedingfor the purpose
</p>
<p>of inducing the Protestants to join them. "And, above all things,
</p>
<p>" let them avoid any outbreak or collision with the troops or police.
</p>
<p>" The police, to a man, and the majority of the troops of the line, are
</p>
<p>" Irishmen." Now, it would appear very strange if anything did
</p>
<p>prevail at these meetings but perfect peace and tranquillity, when the
</p>
<p>people are told to abstain from any conflict with the police or the mi-
</p>
<p>litary, that they are Irishmen, and that they will not draw the sword
</p>
<p>against their countrymen. " Do not get into collision with them ;
</p>
<p>" trust them when the time arrives ; why should you suspect their
</p>
<p>" patriotism ? Why should the people despair of their patriotism, or
</p>
<p>" injure them in any way ? Premature insurrection, and needless
</p>
<p>" provocation of party, and military hostility, have, before now, ruined
</p>
<p>" as good hopes as ours." The morality they would inculcate is this 
</p>
<p>Do not violate the law ; do not interfere with the police ; come into
</p>
<p>no collision with the military; do not commit any breach of the peace ;
</p>
<p>not because it is contrary to law, but because such an outbreak has
</p>
<p>before now ruined such a case as yours. " Rapid, uniform, and care-
</p>
<p>" ful organization for the Repeal agitation, charity and conciliation,
</p>
<p>" and a strict observance of the law, are the pressing and present du-
</p>
<p>" ties of every Irishman. Thus shall we baffle our foes! We have
</p>
<p>" been led into this train of thought by Mr. O'Connell's proposal to
</p>
<p>" form an association of three hundred men of trust, to consider and
</p>
<p>" prepare a bill for the Repeal of the Union. We did not hesitate to
</p>
<p>" differ from that illustrious man upon smaller questions. If we dis-
</p>
<p>" liked his present design, we should at once express our dissent, for
</p>
<p>" candour and fair dealing are the 6rst of all duties in times like
</p>
<p>" these. We speak then not as flatterers, nor thoughtless assertors,
</p>
<p>" when we call this project the wisest, the boldest, and the mostpreg-
</p>
<p>" nant with great result, of any measure he ever proposed in Ireland ;
</p>
<p>" if the people do their duty, this machinery must triumph. But
</p>
<p>" upon the composition of that body, on the just and judicious zeal

<p>" with which it is matured, and on the firm courage with which it is
</p>
<p>" backed by the people, everything depends. If the people, fluttered
</p>
<p>" at the thought of a new plan, grow negligent in their organization
</p>
<p>" and remiss in their agitation, or if they hastily promise, and blindly
</p>
<p>" appoint as the trustees of their subscriptions cowards, blockheads,

<p>" knaves, or bigots, men of doubtful courage, vain or clumsy intellects,
</p>
<p>" or uncertain devotion to Ireland ; if these trustees are not confided
</p>
<p>" in, no matter what they may or will do, and if they are not sup-
</p>
<p>" ported to the last shilling, and to the last man, the attempt will only
</p>
<p>" come crushing back on us in shame and ruin. But if the people go
</p>
<p>" on meeting, organizing, collecting, and conciliating ; if they trust
</p>
<p>" their contributions to bold, faithful, educated, and tolerant men,
</p>
<p>" and if they stand by these they trust, without cavil or flinching,
</p>
<p>41 Ireland will soon be a nation." It is said that we ought to have
</p>
<p>prosecuted the editor of the paper for this article. Had we done
</p>
<p>095
</p>
<p>so, we should not have been able to arrive at what we have now es-
</p>
<p>tablished  the true nature and object of this conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Mr. Duffy is not content with that article ; in the same paper is one,
</p>
<p>entitled " Our Nationality," and I pray your attention to this passage in
</p>
<p>it : " This is a mighty accomplishment. The great seed is sown  the
</p>
<p>" people come together  they move on  they are in earnest  they
</p>
<p>" are determined. The end is begun ; already Ireland is a nation.
</p>
<p>" And this is but the work of a few." Now 1 must protest against
</p>
<p>being implicated in the charge that lam prosecuting the Irish nation.
</p>
<p>I am prosecuting those few who thus work upon the deluded people,
</p>
<p>and who are sought to be made their victims. " The lessons of san-
</p>
<p>" guinemen, among whom we have had an humble place  the history
</p>
<p>" of truth, confirmed and matured by wrong. Men's thoughts were
</p>
<p>" troubled : they were told to garner their individual sufferings  to
</p>
<p>" forget them in their country's dependence. History was open to
</p>
<p>" them, and it showed them those on whose fiat their hopes are based
</p>
<p>" remorseless, truthless, cold, selfish, and bloody, in every age, in
</p>
<p>" every clime. They have resolved to trust no more to treachery,
</p>
<p>" and their resolve, as it ever must be in the case of a unanimous and
</p>
<p>" daring nation, is already a wish fulfilled. And in this virtuous un-
</p>
<p>" dertaking the Irish do not want for cheering inspirations ; good
</p>
<p>'' men, whether subdued or triumphant, from the Danube to the
</p>
<p>" Seine, and from the Seine to the Ohio, look approvingly on their
</p>
<p>" actions, and take their cause to heart. Among the whole civilized
</p>
<p>" race, they have no foes but the Saxon  no opponent but the clumsy
</p>
<p>" and decrepid thing that calls itself our master." Here are two ob-
</p>
<p>jects to be followed out, one designating England to be such a clumsy
</p>
<p>and decrepid thing as to be unable to resist aggression, and the other
</p>
<p>holding them up to the people as remorseless, cold, selfish, and bloody.
</p>
<p>" Wiih so little to deter us, with heaven above us and the earth be-
</p>
<p>" low us where our martyred fathers lie, with our conscience as our
</p>
<p>" guide and the world to cheer us, is it not marvellous that we could
</p>
<p>" have so long stooped to a beggarly servility? But this is unavail-
</p>
<p>" ing. Let us look back only to be assured. If the past supply no

<p>" higher impulses than the present let it be forgotten. It has lessons
</p>
<p>" which, when we are called on to forgive, will afford ample scope
</p>
<p>" for the exercise of the most difficult of Christian virtues, and till
</p>
<p>" then it shall rest with those unavenged heroes who have become a
</p>
<p>" portion of itself. At present other thoughts must animate, and
</p>
<p>" other impulses must be obeyed ; there is yet work to be done, dan-
</p>
<p>" ger to be braved, and difficulty to be removed. These are to be
</p>
<p>" met and triumphed over. Every successive step, as it becomes
</p>
<p>" more momentous becomes more perilous, aud requires correspond"
</p>
<p>" ing caution, courage, and virtue. Our enemy may be aroused and
</p>
<p>" so must Ireland. The county of Tipperary is on its peaceful pa-
</p>
<p>" rade ; there prevailed among the people there a senseless indiffer-
</p>
<p>" ence  a disinclination for so high an enterprise  they felt that
</p>
<p>" until now the time was not come. Their present earnestness de-
</p>
<p>" monstrated that they but waited for an auspicious hour to strike a
</p>
<p>" decisive blow, and take a becoming stand for the fortunes of their
</p>
<p>606
</p>
<p>(< country. Their purpose is a noble one ; and if we interpret them
</p>
<p>" aright, their plans must be successful. There are to be two meet-
</p>
<p>" ings, one in each Riding. Neither is meant for show : the multi-
</p>
<p>" tude will not come to gaze and shout, and return to a listless indif-
</p>
<p>" ference in their country's fate. They will come pledged to purchase
</p>
<p>" its redemption at whatever cost. The demonstration will be one of
</p>
<p>" words. Each parish will be prepared to show, not what it thinks,
</p>
<p>" but what it has done. They will appoint representative delegates
</p>
<p>" from every locality, who will tender to the Liberator the allegiance
</p>
<p>" of those who are willing to pay for the honour of rescuing their
</p>
<p>" country. Those two meetings will come off on the 23rd and 25th
</p>
<p>" of May, and if we be not misinformed, these days will form a me-
</p>
<p>" morable era in the struggle for native liberty. 20,000 native Tip-
</p>
<p>" perary men, who would as soon, if called on, pay their blood as their
</p>
<p>" subscriptions, would not form a bad National Guard for Ireland."
</p>
<p>The damning effect of this document was felt by Mr. Whiteside,
</p>
<p>upon whose client it particularly bore ; and what was the course
</p>
<p>adopted by him, when that document was read ? I own I felt
</p>
<p>something like indignation, but which 1 am willing to excuse
</p>
<p>by reason of the peculiar difficulty in which this evidence placed
</p>
<p>any counsel who had to defend Mr. Duffy. You will recollect,
</p>
<p>that it was arranged on both sides, during the trial, that the ar-
</p>
<p>ticles in the newspapers relied on by the Crown should be read
</p>
<p>first, and that the articles in the same papers, which might be
</p>
<p>considered to be favourable to the case of the traversers, should be
</p>
<p>read next. This was done for convenience. The regular and proper
</p>
<p>course would have been, to have delayed the reading of those articles
</p>
<p>considered favourable to the traversers until the statement of their
</p>
<p>case. Now how was it the article I have just read was sought to
</p>
<p>be got rid of? Mr. Whiteside called for the production of another
</p>
<p>article in the same paper. What was it ? A love song! You recol-
</p>
<p>lect the shouts of laughter that this excited. Now it struck me with
</p>
<p>astonishment when 1 heard an attempt made to get rid of evidence
</p>
<p>of the nature I have read, by calling for the reading of a love song,

</p>
<p>and the inelevancy of this piece of evidence on the part of Duffy must
</p>
<p>have struck you at the time. 1 shall now come to another subject.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, amongst the principal instruments by which the
</p>
<p>purposes of these parties were to be accomplished were, the Re-
</p>
<p>peal Wardens. Now I do not profess to be able to tell you all the
</p>
<p>duties they have to discharge. I am only able to call your attention
</p>
<p>to certain instructions given them on their appointment, and which
</p>
<p>we have succeeded in procuring evidence of. These are very neces-
</p>
<p>sary to show the direct intention of those parties. You will find
</p>
<p>every speech, every fact, all have the same tendency, the same object,
</p>
<p>and all evidence to the same end. This book, entitled, " Instructions
</p>
<p>for Repeal Wardens," specifies what their duties are. [See ante,
</p>
<p>p. 206.] The second duty of the Repeal Warden is, " to collect the
</p>
<p>" repeal fund from each individual willing to contribute one farthing-
</p>
<p>" a week, one penny a month, or one shilling a year  taking care to
</p>
<p>" make every person favourable to the Repeal understand, that, unless
</p>
<p>69?
</p>
<p>" he contributes to the amount of one shilling a year, his name cannot
</p>
<p>" be enrolled as a Repealer, and, therefore, he will be looked upon
</p>
<p>" by the enemies of Ireland as against the Repeal." It is my firm
</p>
<p>belief, that many persons have been induced to subscribe to the funds
</p>
<p>of this Association by coercion and intimidation, and I think that the
</p>
<p>evidence in the case bears me out in saying- so, otherwise what ivould
</p>
<p>be the meaning- of having persons held up as enemies to their country ?
</p>
<p>Can you suffer to be called an enemy to your country?  and, there-
</p>
<p>fore, one of the duties of the Repeal Wardens was, to tell them that
</p>
<p>unless they subscribed they should be set down as enemies to their
</p>
<p>country. The ninth duty of the Repeal Wardens is, to see that
</p>
<p>newspapers are transmitted from the Association to each locality which
</p>
<p>has subscribed the necessary sums. The tenth duty is, that they
</p>
<p>are to take care to have those papers circulated as widely as possible :
</p>
<p>and it adds : " That no person is to be recommended for the appoint-
</p>
<p>" ment, but one who is thoroughly convinced that whoever violates
</p>
<p>" the law, strengthens the enemies of Ireland : this is an axiom of
</p>
<p>" most undoubted truth. It ought, we repeat it, to be engraved
</p>
<p>" on the mind of every Repealer, that ' whoever violates the law,
</p>
<p>" strengthens the enemies of Ireland.' ' We have heard this
</p>
<p>maxim relied on, and you can now from the evidence understand
</p>
<p>the materiality of this, the principle was  whoever puts himself
</p>
<p>in the power of the law thereby paralyses our exertions, and puts
</p>
<p>it in the power of our enemies to frustrate our designs. We shall
</p>
<p>hear, by-and-by, Mr. Duffy, on the Morality of War ; this was the
</p>
<p>morality of peace ; this was what was to guide the members of
</p>
<p>this Association. I read these, not because they are not in them-
</p>
<p>selves perfectly proper, but for' the purpose of neutralizing the only
</p>
<p>thing like an argument put forward by the counsel for the traversers,
</p>
<p> that because these meetings were peaceable, and no alarm was
</p>
<p>created, therefore they had nothing illegal in view.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I now come to a stage in those proceedings of con-
</p>
<p>siderable importance. I mean the statement made by Sir Robert
</p>
<p>Peel. [See ante, page 76.] I do not think there could be stronger

</p>
<p>language used to express the determination of the Government to
</p>
<p>maintain the Union as it existed, by all constitutional means in
</p>
<p>their power, and by the ordinary means afforded them  the or-
</p>
<p>dinary tribunals of the law of the land; and it is that mode that
</p>
<p>we have adopted in the present prosecution. I make this obser-
</p>
<p>vation for this reason, that in the first place it answered the absurd
</p>
<p>charge, that it was the duty of the Government to call upon Par-
</p>
<p>liament to give them extraordinary powers at variance to or out of the
</p>
<p>ordinary principles of the constitution. Sir Robert Peel expressed
</p>
<p>his determination to try, in the first instance, the ordinary law, and
</p>
<p>except he failed in that, not to introduce a Coercive Act, and it will
</p>
<p>not be until you, Gentlemen, disregard the evidence before you on
</p>
<p>your oaths that anything like extraordinary power will be called for.
</p>
<p>Another reason is, you will recollect that in a speech made by Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell, subsequent to that made by Sir R. Peel, and in reference
</p>
<p>4v
</p>
<p>698
</p>
<p>to it, Mr. O'Connell said it was the intention of the Government to
</p>
<p>coerce by military force the free expression of the Irish people  to
</p>
<p>introduce military power into the country, to coerce public opinion,
</p>
<p>and to put it down by the sword ; but Mr. O'Connell always wrapped
</p>
<p>up his real object by the qualification of " if they attack us." He was
</p>
<p>not warranted in using that observation in consequence of the speech
</p>
<p>of Sir Robert Peel. It was true, no doubt, that military were sent into
</p>
<p>this country, but why were they sent here ? It was the acts of the As-
</p>
<p>sociation that caused them to be sent here, when apprehension was
</p>
<p>entertained that this agitation might not end peaceably, and that at
</p>
<p>once tore off the flimsy pretext made use of, or thrown out by Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I come now to the 6rst of those monster meetings,
</p>
<p>which appears to have been held at Muliingar, on the 14th of
</p>
<p>May, and the proceedings of which have been published in the Pilot
</p>
<p>newspaper of the 15th of May. I will not trouble you with a detail
</p>
<p>of all the preliminaries of that meeting ; the flags, the banners, and
</p>
<p>the processions ; but I shall make this general remark with respect
</p>
<p>to those temperance bands; I regret that such a use has been made
</p>
<p>of them ; I think that no greater blessing could have been conferred
</p>
<p>on this country, than that extraordinary reformation which had been
</p>
<p>effected by the Rev. Mr. Mathew, and I think it is greatly to be re-
</p>
<p>gretted, that many well-meaning persons are deterred from express-
</p>
<p>ing their approbation, which, no doubt, they entertained of the value
</p>
<p>of that movement, by a dread of eucouiaging those temperance bands
</p>
<p>in the course which they were led to adopt at political meetings ; and
</p>
<p>I am perfectly satisfied that the Rev. Gentleman, with whom that
</p>
<p>temperance society originated, never contemplated that the move-
</p>
<p>ment which he intended to work only for good, should be thwarted in
</p>
<p>its progress by the purposes which it was mixed up with. At that
</p>
<p>meeting of the 14th of May, Mr. Barrett took a conspicuous part;
</p>
<p>and 1 think I shall fully satify you of his participation in the objects
</p>
<p>of those conspirators, for such they were, and his department in it
</p>
<p>seemed to be principally the circulation of the intelligence of their

</p>
<p>proceedings. He said there: "The Union is the atrocious measure
</p>
<p>" that we have met here to-day to put an end to, and which Peel and
</p>
<p>" Wellington had fulminated their determination to perpetuate." You
</p>
<p>will observe that was after Sir Robert Peel's declaration of the deter-
</p>
<p>mination of Her Majesty's Government to maintain the Union. He
</p>
<p>says : " If they use force against us, that is a game two can play at.
</p>
<p>" Violence against Ireland would be a war, and not merely a riot or
</p>
<p>" rebellion. I have my own opinion as to the result of it ; but this
</p>
<p>" is certain, that be the result of it what it may, England would come
</p>
<p>" out of it a broken down and third-rate power." To the people of
</p>
<p>England that means, " if you dare to assail us you will come out of
</p>
<p>the conflict a broken and third-rate power." To the people of Ireland
</p>
<p>it means, the English will not dare to carry into effect the declaration
</p>
<p>of Sir Robert Peel, for that they would feel themselves too weak to
</p>
<p>do it. He went on to ask, " would they dare to silence them? "
</p>
<p>G99
</p>
<p>Why, what have the Government done to silence them ? They have
</p>
<p>said, that until the ordinary powers of the law were tried, and failed,
</p>
<p>there would be no Gagging Bill; no Coercion Act would be tried. It
</p>
<p>is therefore a gross perversion of Sir Robert Peel's declaration in Par-
</p>
<p>liament to put any such construction upon it as that he meant to
</p>
<p>silence the expression of public opinion. Again, he says: " We may
</p>
<p>" be silent, but it will be the silence of gunpowder ; we shall crouch,
</p>
<p>" but it will be the crouch of the tiger, ready to take the sure, but
</p>
<p>" terrible spring, and clutch our independence." You all remember
</p>
<p>the dramatic effect with which Mr. Whiteside dwelt upon that pas-
</p>
<p>sage ; but what is the meaning- of it ? It is this, we are silent for the
</p>
<p>present, it is true, but it is the silence of determined preparation, which,
</p>
<p>when the proper time arrives, will enable us " to take the sure but
</p>
<p>terrible spring, and clutch the independence of Ireland." This was
</p>
<p>figurative language, but it was sufficiently intelligible. " The moment
</p>
<p>" has passed for vain regrets, and to suppose that you would neglect
</p>
<p>" your opportunity would be to suppose that you would reject that
</p>
<p>" which Providence in its mercy has presented to you." Mad that
</p>
<p>reference to any expected Act of Parliament to repeal the Union ?
</p>
<p>No, the opportunity referred to was that to be afforded by the orga-
</p>
<p>nization of the people to be called forth at the proper time.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I will now proceed to the next meeting, which was
</p>
<p>held at Longford on the 28th of May. Two witnesses have been exa-
</p>
<p>mined with respect to that meeting, and to a few passages in their evi-
</p>
<p>dence I will take leave to direct your attention. These witnesses' names
</p>
<p>were Johnson and Maguire. Johnson deposed that he was a Head-con-
</p>
<p>stable, and that he was stationed at Sligo in the month of May last ;
</p>
<p>that he was at the Longford meeting, which was attended by 50,000
</p>
<p>persons ; that he saw large bodies of horsemen who were usually led on
</p>
<p>by priests, and that he saw Mr. O'Connell there, and also Mr. Steele,
</p>
<p>who distributed amongst the crowd bundles of papers which were said
</p>
<p>to be copies of Mr. O'Connell's speeches. He also deposed that Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell delivered a speech there, in the course of which he made
</p>
<p>a very significant pause. Witness was likewise asked was there any

</p>
<p>appearance of tumult at the meeting, and his reply was a very sensi-
</p>
<p>ble one. He said, " there was not, for they were not going to fight
</p>
<p>with one another." They were all of the same way of thinking.
</p>
<p>He said that the people appeared perfectly willing to do anything that
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell bid them, and that they were so numerous and united,
</p>
<p>that the police dare not face them. The second witness was a Con-
</p>
<p>stable of the name of Maguire, who deposed that he heard Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell make a speech, at the conclusion of which he told the people to
</p>
<p>go home quietly to their friends, and that when he wanted them again
</p>
<p>he would let them know the day. That expression was used at al-
</p>
<p>most all the meetings, and it was a most significant one. An at-
</p>
<p>tempt had been made to cast aspersions on the veracity of Maguire,
</p>
<p>on the ground, forsooth, that he was anxious to be promoted in the
</p>
<p>service ; but I want to know what right have the counsel at the other
</p>
<p>side to cast imputations on the Crown witnesses, and accuse them of
</p>
<p>perjury, when they have not brought upon the table a single witness
</p>
<p>Too
</p>
<p>to contradict him. I will read for you the notes taken of Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell's speech at Longford : " Let them but attack us," said Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell, " and then"  then came the pause, and thereby the mean-
</p>
<p>ing of that pause was too plain for any one to doubt. It was at
</p>
<p>Longford that, according to this witness, the arbitration system was
</p>
<p>first broached. The witness further deposed, that Mr. O'Connell told
</p>
<p>the people to go home quietly, and that when he wanted them again
</p>
<p>he would let them know the day. This took place at a meeting in
</p>
<p>the early part of the day. There was, on the same clay, a dinner at
</p>
<p>Longford, and at that dinner Mr. O'Connell made a speech, part of
</p>
<p>which, and only a part, had been commented upon on the part of the
</p>
<p>traversers, or even read by them. It appears that Lord Beaumont, an
</p>
<p>English Roman Catholic peer, had expressed his dissatisfaction at the
</p>
<p>course that was pursued in this country with regard to the agitation of
</p>
<p>the Repeal of the Union ; and expressed his determination not merely
</p>
<p>to discountenance it, but if necessary, to vote that the Government be
</p>
<p>armed with additional power in any step they might find it necessary
</p>
<p>to make. That was his proposition. At this dinner to which he re-
</p>
<p>ferred, a speech was made, on the introduction of Lord Beaumont's
</p>
<p>name by Mr. O'Connell ; what Mr. Whiteside said, was merely a
</p>
<p>scolding match between Mr. O'Connell and Lord Beaumont; that
</p>
<p>you could not expect him to be very measured in his language ; and
</p>
<p>that you could not be supposed that he was engaged in a conspiracy,
</p>
<p>by his using such language. Certainly not ; but let me read the re-
</p>
<p>mainder of his speech. Mr. O'Connell said: " I ask you, mongrel,
</p>
<p>" heartless Beaumont, do you wish it to go to the people of Ireland,
</p>
<p>" that you would support the English Minister if he was mad
</p>
<p>" enough to make war upon the Catholics of Ireland ?" Why, Lord
</p>
<p>Beaumont never expressed any intention of suporting the Minister in
</p>
<p>making war upon the Catholics of Ireland, but that, if it was neces-
</p>
<p>sary, if the Government found the common law of the land were
</p>
<p>ineffectual, he would support any measure that would give them ad-
</p>
<p>ditional aid, and not to make any war upon the Catholics of Ireland.
</p>
<p>Then Mr. O'Connell went on to say: " Suppose some Irish Paddy

<p>" had escaped from the slaughter, and going over to London, had
</p>
<p>" met some of his former neighbours, they would ask him the news;
</p>
<p>" but what would be the tidings he would have to bring them? He
</p>
<p>" should say to one  ' Jemmy, your father has been killed.' To
</p>
<p>" another: ' Tom, your brother has been shot.' A third would ask
</p>
<p>"him: 'but my sister, Eleanor, does she live?' He would say:
</p>
<p>" ' your sister is not dead.' ' But is my father alive?' ' No ; your
</p>
<p>" 'sister watched his corpse, but she is herself worse than dead  she
</p>
<p>"  is now a sad maniac roaming the wilds, and, like the wretched
</p>
<p>" ' maniac of song, warning her sex against the ruffian soldiers of
</p>
<p>" ' Britain.' Yes, my Lord Beaumont, the brother of Ellen O'Moore
</p>
<p>" would be near your castle; he would hear that you were one of the
</p>
<p>" men who hallooed on the destroyers of the peace of his home. Oh,

<p>" you would be very safe that evening ! Would you not, Lord Beau-
</p>
<p>" mont ?" This was the interchange of scurrilous language between
</p>
<p>701
</p>
<p>Lord Beaumont and Mr. O'Connell. I say this was a direct in-
</p>
<p>centive to the people of this country, if occasion should arrive. Upon
</p>
<p>that course of proceeding I cannot trust myself in making any com-
</p>
<p>ment. Mr. O'Connell went on to say : " The manufactories in your
</p>
<p>" neighbourhood would be safe too ! and proud London herself, in
</p>
<p>" which you would fiatter yourself with the hope of being secure,
</p>
<p>" would be also safe when the account of the ruin of Ireland would
</p>
<p>" arrive ! No ! one blaze of powerful fire would reacli through her
</p>
<p>" vast extent ; and, in the destruction of England, would vindicate
</p>
<p>" the country of the maddened and persecuted Irishman who would
</p>
<p>" have reached her shore." Mr. O'Connell may preach as long as
</p>
<p>he pleases the doctrine of obedience to the law ; he may profess to
</p>
<p>inculcate on his hearers the sentiment of charity and good will, but
</p>
<p>he never can neutralize that speech ; he never can qualify it, nor ex-
</p>
<p>plain it ; he never can say that it has any other meaning. than that
</p>
<p>which necessarily pressed upon the mind of everybody who read it,
</p>
<p>that when the time arrived, the people of this country would fire the
</p>
<p>manufactories of England. Now, I charge the traversers with seeking
</p>
<p>to intimidate the people of England ; I charge them with inciting the
</p>
<p>people of Ireland against their English neighbours. Have I not proof
</p>
<p>of both in this speech ? Even suppose Mr. O'Connell did not really
</p>
<p>mean to suggest to the people to fire the manufactories, what would be
</p>
<p>the necessary effect of his speech ? Would it not be to give cause for
</p>
<p>apprehension to the people of England ? I am far from saying that
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell ever intended such a proceeding as that.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, in the Freeman 's Journal of the 31st of May, there is
</p>
<p>a report of the proceedings of the Association of the previous day, and
</p>
<p>I shall beg leave to call your attention to that part of the evidence
</p>
<p>which was used for the defence. Mr. O'Connell on that occasion ap-
</p>
<p>pears to have corrected the report of the speech he made at Longford.
</p>
<p>He denied having called the soldiers of Great Britain a " ruffian soldie-
</p>
<p>" ry, because he knew that any such statement, if it were made, would
</p>
<p>" be false ;" and with regard to the sergeants especially he said : " that
</p>
<p>" if justice were done to them there was not one of them that would

</p>
<p>" not be raised to the rank of an officer." In another speech, at a later
</p>
<p>part of the proceedings at the same meeting, he stated that he had
</p>
<p>undoubted authority for telling the people of Ireland, that the decla-
</p>
<p>ration to maintain the Union, made by Sir Robert Peel in the House
</p>
<p>of Commons, was unauthorized by Her Majesty, and that the Queen
</p>
<p>had reproached Sir Robert Peel for having used her name for such
</p>
<p>a purpose without her sanction. Now, upon what authority Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell has thought fit to make that assertion, it is impossible for
</p>
<p>me to conjecture ; but I advert to this, not for the purpose alone of
</p>
<p>expressing my astonishment that he should make this assertion, but
</p>
<p>for the further purpose to show that the object he had in making
</p>
<p>such a statement, was that of endeavouring to make thepeople be-
</p>
<p>lieve that the Queen was favourable to a Repeal of the Union, and
</p>
<p>was only prevented from granting it by the hostility of the people of
</p>
<p>England and of the British Ministry to Ireland. I do not mean, Gentlemen
</p>
<p>702
</p>
<p>of the Jury, far be it from me, to arraign the loyalty of those poor people;
</p>
<p>but I must say, since the loyalty of these proceedings is so strongly
</p>
<p>dwelt upon by the traversers, it is rather inconsistent with that loyalty,
</p>
<p>to endeavour to impress on the minds of the people the notion that the
</p>
<p>Queen had both the inclination and the power to accomplish the object
</p>
<p>which they had in view, the restoring of a native Parliament. However,
</p>
<p>1 do not wish to derogate from the loyalty of these people ; that is not
</p>
<p>the question here. You will find that this is only one of the several de-
</p>
<p>lusions which have been industriously practised on these poor people ;
</p>
<p>a delusion both in point of fact and in point of law, as I shall show
</p>
<p>you more particularly hereafter. There is this observation also to be
</p>
<p>made: Mr. O'Connell on that occasion corrected the report of his
</p>
<p>having used the expression, " the ruffian soldiery of Britain." It is
</p>
<p>perfectly plain, therefore, that he read the report. Do you find that
</p>
<p>he retracted the other parts of the speech ? They were, therefore,
</p>
<p>substantially confirmed ; no part was contradicted except the ex-
</p>
<p>pressions vvith regard to the soldiery.
</p>
<p>I will now call your attention to the meeting at Drogheda, at
</p>
<p>which Mr. Steele delivered a speech, and said he would solicit of his
</p>
<p>august friend O'Connell to appoint him to the leadership of whatever
</p>
<p>enterprise was most desperate, and that he was ready to share the
</p>
<p>dangers of the Irish people, if they were driven to extremities by the
</p>
<p>Cromwells of England. [The Solicitor-General then read and com-
</p>
<p>mented on the report of the Drogheda meeting in the Pilot of the
</p>
<p>7th June, 1843.] Gentlemen, I now come to an article in the
</p>
<p>Nation newspaper, entitled " The Morality of War." [The Solici-
</p>
<p>tor-General then read the article; see ante, page 82.] Nothing can
</p>
<p>be stronger than the language used in that article. Mr. Duffy's
</p>
<p>counsel have not attempted to explain what right he had to instruct
</p>
<p>the military in their duties. Mr. Whiteside said in excuse for these
</p>
<p>strong articles, that they were suggested by the unfortunate occur-
</p>
<p>rence of the death of a private soldier from over-drilling. Recollect,
</p>
<p>that transaction took place far on in the summer, and this appears on
</p>
<p>the 10th of June ; Mr. Whiteside's excuse therefore has no reference

</p>
<p>to this article, and it remains undefended.
</p>
<p>THURSDAY, February 8th.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General.
</p>
<p>My Lords,
</p>
<p>Since I addressed the Court yesterday, I have looked into the
</p>
<p>case of Rex v. Hunt, and I find that it is an authority in support of
</p>
<p>that part of the indictment which charges a conspiracy to create dis-
</p>
<p>content and disaffection, and ill-will and hatred, amongst her Majes-
</p>
<p>ty's subjects. The case is reported in 3 B. & Aid. 567. The fourth
</p>
<p>count in that indictment charges, that the defendants unlawfully did
</p>
<p>703
</p>
<p>meet together, with divers olher persons unknown, to a large number,
</p>
<p>to wit 60,000, for the purpose of exciting discontent and disaffection,
</p>
<p>and for the purpose of exciting the subjects to hatred of the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment and Constitution. And Chief Justice Abbott says, in pp. 571-2,
</p>
<p>" It appears to me, therefore, that the proposed evidence relating to
</p>
<p>" the conduct of other persons, in a matter subsequent, was properly
</p>
<p>" rejected ; but, if this were more doubtful than it appears to me to
</p>
<p>" be, with reference to the whole charge originally preferred against
</p>
<p>" the defendants, still that doubt would be altogether removed by the
</p>
<p>" verdict, which, having narrowed the offence of the defendants to
</p>
<p>" the fourth count, which charges ' an unlawful assembly for the
</p>
<p>'' purpose of exciting discontent and disaffection,' and does not
</p>
<p>" charge any actual or intended violence, has, in my opinion, unques-
</p>
<p>" tionably rendered the proposed evidence irrelevant, as having no
</p>
<p>" bearing upon that charge."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I shall now call your attention to the next
</p>
<p>piece of evidence given on behalf of the Crown; that is, a report of
</p>
<p>the proceedings of the Kilkenny meeting, which has been read from
</p>
<p>the Pilot newspaper of the 12th June, 1843. On that occasion Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell made a speech, to which I shall beg leave to call your at-
</p>
<p>tention. He alluded to the Repeal wardens, and said they were the
</p>
<p>men by whom he hoped to obtnin the Repeal ; and that there was no
</p>
<p>more honourable station than theirs ; and he also stated, that the Irish
</p>
<p>people were threatened with civil war by the Ministers. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>this allusion to civil war was made in 1834, not by the members of
</p>
<p>the present Government. I told you yesterday the construction to be
</p>
<p>put on Sir Robert Peel's statement in the House of Commons, on the
</p>
<p>9th of May ; it was nothing more than this.  Whenaked whether it
</p>
<p>was the intention of the Government to put a stop to this agitation, he
</p>
<p>expressed the reluctance of the Government to apply for additional
</p>
<p>powers until it should be ascertained whether, in point of law, the
</p>
<p>conduct of those concerned in this agitation was criminally cognizable
</p>
<p>at common law ; and he did not threaten to put it down by civil war,
</p>
<p>as Mr. O'Connell has said.

</p>
<p>Mr. Sheil.  I think my learned friend has no right to advert to
</p>
<p>motives expressed by Sir Robert Peel in Parliament , and he had no
</p>
<p>right yesterday to tell the jury, that, unless they found a verdict for
</p>
<p>the Crown, a Coercion Bill would be introduced.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor- General.  I have endeavoured, as much as pos-
</p>
<p>sible, not to advert to topics not given in evidence. I have made no
</p>
<p>observations I did not feel perfectly warranted in making, from the
</p>
<p>evidence. What I intended to say yesterday was this, that Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell having, in some of his speeches, attempted to justify an appeal to
</p>
<p>physical force, by the supposition that a declaration of civil war had
</p>
<p>been made by Sir Robert Peel in Parliament, my intention was to
</p>
<p>shew you that there was no ground for the apprehension of such a
</p>
<p>consequence from Sir Robert Peel's reply, and that it did not warrant
</p>
<p>the language used by Mr. O'Connell. There certainly was nothing
</p>
<p>further from my intention than to hold out anything like a minacious
</p>
<p>704
</p>
<p>argument to you, and if I did use words capable of that construction
</p>
<p>I in the most unqualified manner call upon you not to let them in the
</p>
<p>slightest degree influence your verdict. Gentlemen, Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>has repeatedly asserted that he would keep the parties out of the law,
</p>
<p>that there should be no violation of the law  and we have now brought
</p>
<p>the question to issue between us and Mr. O'Connell, whether what
</p>
<p>has taken place is cognizable at common law, or not. Gentlemen, Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell on that occasion also alluded to the sergeants in the British
</p>
<p>army, and said, if they were fairly treated they ought to be raised to the
</p>
<p>rank of officers. I have already read an article in the Nation, on the
</p>
<p>" Morality of War," and I shall have occasion to advert by- and- by to
</p>
<p>another document on the same subject, by which you will find that each
</p>
<p>of the traversers was pursuing the same objects in a different way, one
</p>
<p>of these being to tamper with the army, or at least to lead the people
</p>
<p>of this country to believe that the army would be passive in the
</p>
<p>event of an outbreak. Again, he says : " Oh what a mass of phy-
</p>
<p>" sical force have we not witnessed to-day ? We stand at the
</p>
<p>" head of a body of men that, if organized by military discipline,
</p>
<p>" would be quite abundant for the conquest of Europe. Welling-
</p>
<p>" ton had never such an army as we saw here to-day. There were
</p>
<p>" not at Waterloo, on both sides, so many stout, active, energetic
</p>
<p>" men as we saw to-day. Oh ! but it will be said, ' they are not
</p>
<p>" disciplined ;' if you tell them what to do you will have them all
</p>
<p>" disciplined in an hour." Now allow me to call your attention to
</p>
<p>this language of Mr. O'Connell, and to ask you whether you can
</p>
<p>reconcile that with his language about the concentration of moral
</p>
<p>force, and the union of public opinion ? Do you believe that the
</p>
<p>people would understand that they should be called on for something,
</p>
<p>or that it should be understood in England, that such was the state
</p>
<p>of discipline and organization amongst the people in this country, that
</p>
<p>it would not be safe to refuse a Repeal of the Union. Again he
</p>
<p>says, " Do not you think that they are as well able to walk in order
</p>
<p><( after a band as if they wore red coats, and that they would be as
</p>
<p>" ready to obey the Repeal Wardens as if they were called sergeants

</p>
<p>" or captains?" Am I to be told that this is not an allusion to any-
</p>
<p>thing like physical force ? It is needless to follow that subject fur-
</p>
<p>ther, but it cannnot have any reference but to physical force.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I will now draw your attention to a meeting which
</p>
<p>took place at Mallow, on the 11th of June. Before I shall call
</p>
<p>your attention to the language used on that occasion, I shall advert
</p>
<p>to the evidence of John Jolly, with respect to that meeting. He
</p>
<p>states that he is in the Police, and attended that meeting, which
</p>
<p>was very numerous. That they marched in regular order, with
</p>
<p>bands playing and banners flying, four and six abreast in column.
</p>
<p>That there were persons taking command. He said Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>addressed the meeting, and told them that they should have Repeal,
</p>
<p>that they should have Ireland for the Irish. He asked them would
</p>
<p>they be ready to come again if he wanted them, and desired as many
</p>
<p>as would to hold up their hands ; and he said, when they came again,
</p>
<p>he would require them to come armed  but the arms would be
</p>
<p>Repeal cards.
</p>
<p>705
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you will always find a qualification of this sentence in
</p>
<p>allusion to force; whether that qualification be bond Jide or not, is
</p>
<p>for you to say ; but as to the effect it had on the crowd assem-
</p>
<p>bled you will have little doubt from what I shall show by-and-by.
</p>
<p>This man was cross examined, and not the slightest evidence was
</p>
<p>produced to contradict him. We find a report of that meeting in
</p>
<p>the Pilot newspaper of the 12th of June. At the dinner on that
</p>
<p>occasion Mr. O'Connell said : " Yes, I speak with the awful determi-
</p>
<p>" nation with which I commenced my address, in consequence of the
</p>
<p>" news received this day. There was no House of Commons on
</p>
<p>" Thursday, for the Cabinet were considering what they should do,
</p>
<p>" not for Ireland but against her. If they assailed us to-morrow,
</p>
<p>" and that we conquered them, as conquer them we will one day,
</p>
<p>" the first use of that victory which we would make, would be to place
</p>
<p>" the sceptre in the hands of Her who has ever showed us favour,
</p>
<p>" and whose conduct has ever been full of sympathy and emotion
</p>
<p>" for our sufferings." In another part of his speech he says, " Have
</p>
<p>" we not the ordinary courage of Englishmen? Are we to be trampled
</p>
<p>"under foot? Oh, thev shall never trample me at least; I was
</p>
<p>" wrong, they may trample me under foot, I say they may trample
</p>
<p>" me, but it shall be my dead body they will trample on, not the
</p>
<p>" living man." Now, what is the meaning of this, but that if the ne-
</p>
<p>cessity should arrive he would resist by force, and that he would suffer
</p>
<p>death, and have his body trampled on, rather than desert them. Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, you are not to put the ingenious construction upon these words,
</p>
<p>given to them by gentlemen on the other side ; but you are to take
</p>
<p>the natural signification in which they are understood by the parties
</p>
<p>to whom they are addressed. Again , he says : " They have taken
</p>
<p>" one step of coercion, and may I ask them what is to prevent them
</p>
<p>" from taking another? May not they send us to the West Indies,
</p>
<p>" as they have lately emancipated the negroes, to fill up their places.
</p>
<p>" Oh ! it is not an imaginary case at all, for the only Englishman
</p>
<p>" that ever possessed Ireland sent eighty thousand Irishmen to work
</p>
<p>" as slaves, every one of whom perished in the short space of twelve

</p>
<p>" years beneath the ungenial sun of the Indies. Yes, Peel and
</p>
<p>" Wellington may be second Cromwells ; they may get his blunted
</p>
<p>!' truncheon, and they may, oh, sacred Heaven, enact on the fair occu-
</p>
<p>" pants of that gallery the murder of the Wexford ladies." This
</p>
<p>is one of the modes by which the objects of those parties were to be
</p>
<p>effected, keeping up a recollection of the massacres that had taken
</p>
<p>place in Ireland, and thus keeping up a feeling of ill-will towards the
</p>
<p>English. Now, Gentlemen, does anything appear to warrant the as-
</p>
<p>sertion that Mr. O'Connell has thought proper to make, that he had
</p>
<p>any other purpose than that of exciting a bitter hostility towards the
</p>
<p>English people.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I now approach a part of the case that will require
</p>
<p>a great deal of attention. I have postponed the consideration of it
</p>
<p>in conformity with the rule I have laid down of treating this subject
</p>
<p>according to the order of counts. This was a meeting held at Donny-
</p>
<p>brook, on the 3rd of July. Mr. O'Connell upon that occasion made
</p>
<p>4x
</p>
<p>706
</p>
<p>a speech in which he commented at great length upon the evil effects
</p>
<p>which he said resulted from the Union, and then he proceeds to hold out
</p>
<p>to the people the advantages which they may expect to gain from its re-
</p>
<p>peal. In another part of his speech, he says : " They say we shall have
</p>
<p>" to get the English Parliament to prepare an act for the Repeal ; but
</p>
<p>" listen to me. I'm going to tell you something that will interest
</p>
<p>" you. I was told that we would not get the Emancipation Act ;
</p>
<p>" that no bill would be passed through the House ; and the heir ap-
</p>
<p>" parent to the throne took the trouble of swearing an oath to that
</p>
<p>" effect; but he was obliged to swallow that oath, and we were eman-
</p>
<p>" cipated. In order to get the Repeal, it is not necessary to pass
</p>
<p>" an Act in the English Parliament at all. The first men of their
</p>
<p>" day, and the ablest constitutional lawyers, Saurin, Bushe, and
</p>
<p>" Plunket, said, the Irish Parliament had no right to pass the Union
</p>
<p>" Statute." Such was the doctrine laid down by Mr. O'Connell,
</p>
<p>that a reference to the Legislature, as now constituted, in order to
</p>
<p>repeal the Act of Union, was unnecessary. He then said that the
</p>
<p>Irish Parliament was not dead but slumbered, and that by virtue of
</p>
<p>the Royal prerogative, the Queen could issue writs from Chancery,
</p>
<p>and the Irish people would obey them, and by that means the Par-
</p>
<p>liament would be re-created without any reference to the Saxon au-
</p>
<p>thority. The people at all those meetings had been instructed that
</p>
<p>the Queen was favourable to this measure, and he there lays it down
</p>
<p>that she might do so, and that there was no legal objection to the
</p>
<p>Queen doing so.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, this brings me to the consideration of the proposi-
</p>
<p>tion, whether it is consistent with the law of this land to say, that
</p>
<p>the Queen, or the Sovereign, can reconstruct the separate Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment of Ireland, by the mere exercise of the royal prerogative in
</p>
<p>issuing writs to such places in Ireland as Her Majesty may think
</p>
<p>proper. When my learned friend the Attorney-General, in his
</p>
<p>very luminous statement of this case, arrived at this part of it, he
</p>
<p>threw out a challenge to the able counsel on the other side, and
</p>
<p>he asked them how far they were prepared to establish or support

</p>
<p>the opinion of their client on this point ? I do not know that I ex-
</p>
<p>actly understand up to this moment whether they mean at all to in-
</p>
<p>sist upon the legality of that proposition, or if they do, to what ex-
</p>
<p>tent they mean to carry it. I think, however, that I shall have very
</p>
<p>little difficulty in demonstrating to their Lordships, who, I take for
</p>
<p>granted will lay down the law so to you, that Mr. O'Connell's doc-
</p>
<p>trine is a total perversion of the law. It is altogether unsupported
</p>
<p>by any legal principle ; it is directly adverse to the best established
</p>
<p>rules of our law ; it is wholly untenable ; and the result of it would
</p>
<p>be to render void all the Acts of Parliament which have passed since
</p>
<p>the Union. Such must be the necessary consequence of the propo-
</p>
<p>sition that the Union was illegally enacted ; all the Acts of Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment subsequently passed would be void. Mr. O'Connell's remedy
</p>
<p>for that, as you have heard from himself, was this, that when a new
</p>
<p>Parliament shall be constructed under his auspices, a bill may be in-
</p>
<p>troduced to validate all those Acts.
</p>
<p>707
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, it was not, as I could collect, exactly said that the
</p>
<p>Union was void in point of law, but some passages were read from
</p>
<p>speeches of Mr. O'Connell, from which it was inferred that Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell's doctrine was, not that the Union was not binding in
</p>
<p>point of law, but that it was not binding in point of conscience, or
</p>
<p>what is called constitutional principle. I do not profess exactly to
</p>
<p>understand what is meant by constitutional principle as contra-dis-
</p>
<p>tinguished and different from law. Gentlemen, the precedent that
</p>
<p>is urged in support of this view of the law, is the issuing by King
</p>
<p>James of certain writs to boroughs, forty in number, in one day.
</p>
<p>From this it is sought to be argued, that, at any time, it is now in
</p>
<p>the power of the Crown to exercise the same prerogative, and to
</p>
<p>issue writs of the same description. The occasion upon which those
</p>
<p>writs were issued was simply this : up to that time there had been
</p>
<p>no regular division of the kingdom of Ireland into shires or counties;
</p>
<p>there had been large districts, which from time to time were made
</p>
<p>into counties, and as they became counties they had the right of re-
</p>
<p>turning Members to Parliament  knights of the shire for those coun-
</p>
<p>ties. King James issued a certain number of writs to certain bo-
</p>
<p>roughs in Ireland, in order that those boroughs should have their
</p>
<p>due share in the representation of the kingdom ; and in Sir John
</p>
<p>Davies' tracts, in his speech upon the opening of the Parliament to
</p>
<p>which he was chosen Speaker, page 304, he says : " This Parliament
</p>
<p>" is called in such a time, when this great and mighty kingdom being
</p>
<p>" wholly reduced to shire ground [that is, reduced to counties] con-
</p>
<p>" taineth thirty-three counties at large; when all Ulster and Con-
</p>
<p>" naught, as well as Leinster and Munster, have voices in Parliament
</p>
<p>" by their knights and burgesses ; when all the inhabitants of the
</p>
<p>" kingdom, English of birth, English of blood, the new British colony,
</p>
<p>" and the old Irish natives, do all meet together to make laws for the
</p>
<p>" common good of themselves and their posterities. To this end
</p>
<p>" His Majesty hath most graciously and justly erected divers new
</p>
<p>" boroughs in sundry parts of this kingdom. I say, His Majesty hath
</p>
<p>" done it most justly, even as his Highness himself hath been pleased

</p>
<p>" to say, that he was obliged injustice and honour to give all his free
</p>
<p>" subjects of this kingdom indifferent and equal voices in making of
</p>
<p>" their laws, so as one-half of the subjects should not make laws alone
</p>
<p>" [that is, merely the shires], which should bind the other half with-
</p>
<p>" out their consents." He then cites certain precedents in Queen
</p>
<p>Mary's and Queen Elizabeth's time, and then he goes on : " This
</p>
<p>" did Queen Elizabeth in her time. What hath King James done
</p>
<p>"now? Whereas the Queen had omitted to make boroughs in
</p>
<p>" these new counties, the King hath now supplied that defect, by
</p>
<p>" making these new Corporations we spoke of ; for why should all your
</p>
<p>" old shires have cities and boroughs in them, and these new counties
</p>
<p>" be without them? or shall Queen Elizabeth be able to make a
</p>
<p>" county, and shall not King James be able to make a borough ?"
</p>
<p>At that time, Gentlemen, you will observe, there had been no regu-
</p>
<p>lar Constitution of Parliament at all; it had grown gradually, and
</p>
<p>there had been no legislative Act on the subject. Things, how-
</p>
<p>708
</p>
<p>ever, became totally altered when the Union took place ; because
</p>
<p>then the representation of the whole United Kingdom was based on
</p>
<p>the Statute, and accordingly the Statute in the third article enacts,
</p>
<p>that there shall be one and the same Legislature for the whole United
</p>
<p>Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. " That it be the third
</p>
<p>" article of Union, that the said United Kingdom be represented in
</p>
<p>" one and the same Parliament, to be styled ' The Parliament of the
</p>
<p>"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.'" The other
</p>
<p>articles are then specifically enacted ; and in the third section (the
</p>
<p>first section is the section which embodies the several articles) it
</p>
<p>states: "That of the one hundred Commoners to sit on the part of
</p>
<p>" Ireland in the United Parliament, sixty-four shall be chosen for the
</p>
<p>*' counties, and thirty-six for the following cities and boroughs."
</p>
<p>Then they are enumerated. Now, assuming for the present that this
</p>
<p>Act of Parliament has legal validity, the consequence and the effect
</p>
<p>of it are this, that the places specified in it, and these only, are to be
</p>
<p>represented in the United Parliament. To hold out, therefore, the
</p>
<p>doctrine that it is competent to the Crown to issue its writs for the
</p>
<p>purpose of enabling other boroughs or places to return members to
</p>
<p>the United Parliament is neither more nor less than to give a non
</p>
<p>obstante power to the Crown.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  I did not understand the proposition
</p>
<p>to be, that the Crown should issue writs for the United Parliament,
</p>
<p>but for a separate parliament.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor- General.  It comes to the same thing, my Lord.
</p>
<p>This Act enacts, that the Imperial Parliament shall be the Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment with respect to these boroughs ; and if the Crown has the
</p>
<p>right to issue a writ to Kilkenny to send a representative to a sepa-
</p>
<p>rate Irish Parliament, it is in effect repealing the Act of Union, and
</p>
<p>giving a non obstante power to the Crown. In the fourth section
</p>
<p>you will find this enacted : " And no meeting shall at any time here-
</p>
<p>" after be summoned, called, convened, or held for the purpose of
</p>
<p>" electing any person or persons to serve or act, or to be considered
</p>
<p>" as representative or representatives of any other place, town, city,

<p>" corporation, or borough other than the aforesaid, or as the repre-
</p>
<p>" sentative or representatives of the freemen, freeholders, house-
</p>
<p>" holders, or inhabitants thereof, either in the Parliament of the
</p>
<p>" United Kingdom or elsewhere, unless it shall hereafter be other-
</p>
<p>" wise provided by the Parliament of the United Kingdom." Here
</p>
<p>we have an explicit and direct enactment that no meeting shall be
</p>
<p>convened, nor shall any person be elected or considered as the re-
</p>
<p>presentative of any of the places included in this Act of Parliament,
</p>
<p>either in the United Parliament or elsewhere, except according to
</p>
<p>the provisions of that Act. Yet, Mr. O'Connell pretends to say that
</p>
<p>the Queen has the power of issuing writs to call together an Irish
</p>
<p>Parliament, because, as he says, that Parliament is not dead but
</p>
<p>sleeps; because it is still in constitutional and legal existence, though
</p>
<p>not actually called to meet. That is his proposition. This supposes
</p>
<p>that the Act of Union is altogether void ; that is, in effect, the
</p>
<p>meaning. Mr. O'Connell affects to say, and his counsel, or Mr.
</p>
<p>709
</p>
<p>Whiteside (I believe) one of the counsel, also went the length of
</p>
<p>saying, that it was not meant by that to say, that the Union was not
</p>
<p>binding in point of law, but that it was merely void on what is called
</p>
<p>constitutional principle, and is not binding on conscience. I think,
</p>
<p>however, that I can give a very good explanation of Mr. O'Connell's
</p>
<p>meaning, that is, of the meaning he intended to be conveyed to the
</p>
<p>people of Ireland, by a reference to a document which they them-
</p>
<p>selves offered in evidence the day before yesterday, which they gave
</p>
<p>in evidence, I should rather say. You will recollect, Gentlemen, that
</p>
<p>amongst the documents they handed in, was an address to the peo-
</p>
<p>ple of Ireland, by the Repeal Association, at its first establishment.
</p>
<p>To this address is prefixed a dedication by Mr. O'Connell, in which
</p>
<p>he says : " They were written by one of yourselves for the benefit
</p>
<p>of you all." In this publication, I find the doctrine with respect
</p>
<p>to the Union laid down thus : " Besides all this, it is perfectly clear
</p>
<p>" that the Irish Parliament had no right whatever to vote away their
</p>
<p>" country's independence." Then he cites Lord Plunket's words, and
</p>
<p>Mr. Saurin's. " Such were the means by which the Union was car-
</p>
<p>" ried ; and such was the inherent radical defect in point of law, and
</p>
<p>" in conscience, in that measure." What will be said to that ? Is that,
</p>
<p>or is it not, a deliberate assertion circulated amongst the people of
</p>
<p>Ireland, that by reason of the inherent want of legal power and capa-
</p>
<p>city in the respective Legislatures, and particularly in the Irish legis-
</p>
<p>lature, to pass the Union, it was void in point of law and of con-
</p>
<p>science ? " It is right to see how this inherent vice in the crea-
</p>
<p>tion of the Union, was exhibited by another eminent lawyer." And
</p>
<p>he goes on to cite another passage, of which we have heard a great
</p>
<p>deal in the course of this discussion. He then, in page 53, says :
</p>
<p>" The Queen might be advised to act in either of these two ways.
</p>
<p>" Firstly, she may call together, in Dublin, by intimation or invi-
</p>
<p>" tation, the one hundred and five members now representing Irish
</p>
<p>" constituencies ; more than forty of them, that is more than suf-
</p>
<p>" ficient to make a House, would certainly attend any royal sum-
</p>
<p>" mons, however informal. And Her Majesty might easily bring

</p>
<p>" together a sufficient number of the Irish Peers. And thus, with the
</p>
<p>" assent of Her Majesty, an ordinance might be enacted, adopting
</p>
<p>" the plan we have suggested for re-constructing the Irish Parliament,
</p>
<p>'* and authorizing the issuing of writs or summonses accordingly. The
</p>
<p>" Parliament, when met under such writs or summonses, would have no
</p>
<p>" difficulty in enacting laws, with the assent of the Queen, sanctioning
</p>
<p>" their own appointment, and confirmatory of their own legislative
</p>
<p>" powers." And then he refers to precedents, where the two branches
</p>
<p>of the Legislature had enacted certain measures, with respect to the
</p>
<p>Government and Constitution of England, which had been validated
</p>
<p>afterwards, although irregularly done. On those precedents, he holds
</p>
<p>out to the Irish people the possibility that writs might be issued for
</p>
<p>the calling together of the Irish Parliament ; and that that Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment, when called together, might validate its own powers. And
</p>
<p>with respect to those precedents on which he founds this doctrine,
</p>
<p>he says, in page 55; " But what a host of legal and technical objec-
</p>
<p>710
</p>
<p>a tions were and may be raised against each and all the precedents
</p>
<p>" which we have thus cited, including the glorious Revolution itself!
</p>
<p>" We venture to assert that none greater could be stated to eitherofthe
</p>
<p>" modes of repealing the Union we have suggested  no, nor by any
</p>
<p>" comparison so great ! It was indeed from these instances that our
</p>
<p>" constitutional lawyers, and particularly Judge Blackstone, have
</p>
<p>" spoken of ' the omnipotence of Parliament.' There is no possible
</p>
<p>" reason why an Irish Parliament should not be as omnipotent in
</p>
<p>J< Ireland as an English Parliament in England." Gentlemen, I
</p>
<p>mentioned to you that one of the objects of these parties was to per-
</p>
<p>suade the people of Ireland, and to keep them in the delusion, that
</p>
<p>the Queen had the power, and also the inclination, to further their
</p>
<p>wishes, by having the Union in fact repealed. Gentlemen, he by
</p>
<p>whom that is cited, and his counsel, have repeatedly relied on certain
</p>
<p>expressions used  not by lawyers as such, not by Judges, not by any
</p>
<p>persons having authority to lay down the law, but by certain mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the Irish Parliament before the Union was passed, and whilst
</p>
<p>the propriety of passing that measure was under discussion. These
</p>
<p>are held up as the authoritative declarations of those eminent men as
</p>
<p>lawyers and as Judges, that after the Union was passed, it had no
</p>
<p>binding power, by reason of the alleged incapacity of the Irish Par-
</p>
<p>liament to annihilate the separate Legislatures of Ireland. I say,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, a more seditious document than this cannot possibly be
</p>
<p>broached. I say it is illegal and delusive. It is absurd and mon-
</p>
<p>strous to say, that in point of either law, or of conscience, or of
</p>
<p>constitutional principle (I do not care on what ground it is put), the
</p>
<p>Union can be considered as void.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, the professed object of these meetings
</p>
<p>was to petition the United Parliament for a Repeal of this Act. We
</p>
<p>have been more than once asked, why do you seek to fetter the right
</p>
<p>of petitioning? We have the right to petition Parliament to get
</p>
<p>this obnoxious Act repealed. According to the doctrine which lam
</p>
<p>now considering, this is quite unnecessary. If the Queen can issue
</p>
<p>these writs, no resort to Parliament is necessary. If it be the bond

</p>
<p>fide object of Mr. O'Connell to petition Parliament for a Repeal of
</p>
<p>the Union, he must admit the right of the Parliament to have origi-
</p>
<p>nally passed that measure; otherwise the Legislature would not be
</p>
<p>the proper quarter to which this petition ought to be addressed. I
</p>
<p>say it is seditious, and I call it unlawful for any individual to tell Her
</p>
<p>Majesty's subjects that any part of the law of the land of this country
</p>
<p>is not binding. I say it is unconstitutional, seditious, and unlawful,
</p>
<p>to tell any of the Queen's subjects that any Act of Parliament is not
</p>
<p>obligatory on their consciences. To question the constitutional prin-
</p>
<p>ciple of the Union is to question its legality ; and it is merely en-
</p>
<p>deavouring to back out of the necessary consequences of this doctrine,
</p>
<p>when it comes to he discussed in a Court of Justice, to attempt to
</p>
<p>distinguish one of these allegations from the other. It is perfectly
</p>
<p>plain, that what was intended to be conveyed was, that there was no
</p>
<p>binding force whatever in the Act of Union.
</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen, to hold the Union to be void, as has been al-
</p>
<p>711
</p>
<p>ready observed, would come to this  that the Acts of Parliament
</p>
<p>passed since the Union would be without authority. The Emanci-
</p>
<p>pation Act, the Reform Act, and the Act for the improvement of
</p>
<p>the Criminal Code in Ireland, which was introduced by the head of
</p>
<p>the present Ministry, all would go by the board ; and we shall be
</p>
<p>brought back to the state of things prior to the passing of the Union.
</p>
<p>I will not dwell further on such a state of things at present. But, be-
</p>
<p>sides being unlawful, I say this doctrine is delusive ; it is one of the
</p>
<p>means by which the objects of this combination were attempted to
</p>
<p>be effected. The people were totally misled as to the binding nature
</p>
<p>of this Act of Parliament, for the purpose of exciting their dissatis-
</p>
<p>faction against it, and inducing them to suppose that by obeying
</p>
<p>Mr. O'ConnelPs mandates, they would be enabled to get rid of
</p>
<p>this which was thus represented as not binding upon their con-
</p>
<p>sciences. It was further delusive, for this reason, that it was
</p>
<p>founded on a most unjust construction put upon the words and
</p>
<p>meaning of the very eminent men whose names you have heard in
</p>
<p>the course of this trial. In that publication which I have last adverted
</p>
<p>to, I mean the Address of the National Association, you will find
</p>
<p>that it is actually stated that " the present Lord Chancellor, [this
</p>
<p>was in 1840, Lord Plunket being then Lord Chancellor] that
</p>
<p>" the present Lord Chancellor had laid it down that the Union was
</p>
<p>" not binding  that the Irish Legislature had no right to pass the
</p>
<p>M measure of the Union;" leading the people to the inference, that
</p>
<p>the Chancellor, as Chancellor, after the Union, and in his judicial ca-
</p>
<p>pacity, had laid down that monstrous proposition. Why, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>it is most injurious and most libellous to that eminent individual, to
</p>
<p>attribute such a doctrine to him. These sentiments he expressed
</p>
<p>when the measure was under the consideration of the Irish Par-
</p>
<p>liament, but never afterwards, either in his character of a barrister,
</p>
<p>or of Lord Chancellor. So, with respect to the late eminent indi-
</p>
<p>vidual who presided in this Court. It is most unjust to these great
</p>
<p>men, to attribute to them such a doctrine as this ; and it is most
</p>
<p>unfair to the people, who are deluded and deceived by it.

</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, you see so far therefore as relates to the
</p>
<p>doctrine, either that the Queen, by virtue of the royal prerogative,
</p>
<p>can, independently of Parliament, issue writs for the calling together
</p>
<p>a Parliament in Ireland, or to the proposition that the Union is not
</p>
<p>binding in point of law or in conscience, neither of these can be sus-
</p>
<p>tained. They are both unfounded ; they are based upon what I call
</p>
<p>an unfair and unfounded statement of the high authority of these
</p>
<p>eminent persons. I shall, therefore, assume in the rest of my address,
</p>
<p>that you are perfectly satisfied, and that the Court will inform you,
</p>
<p>that there is not the slightest foundation for this doctrine, which has
</p>
<p>been so often reiterated and circulated all over this country, for the
</p>
<p>purpose of misleading and deceiving the unfortunate people to whom
</p>
<p>it was stated.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the meeting at Donnybrook was followed by one at
</p>
<p>Tullamore, as to which we have the evidence of a respectable short-
</p>
<p>hand-writer, Mr. Macnamara. I must call your attention particularly
</p>
<p>712
</p>
<p>to some of the transactions of that meeting. Mr. Macnamara was
</p>
<p>present at the whole ofit ; he gave you a description of the banners,
</p>
<p>and the numbers of people and other particulars which are generally
</p>
<p>of the same character in all these meetings, and I shall not go over
</p>
<p>them again ; I shall come to Mr. O'Connell's speech. He adverts
</p>
<p>to the question of the Repeal of the Union, and the conduct of the
</p>
<p>Whigs and Tories, whom he indiscriminately abuses, and then he goes
</p>
<p>on : " When I began this agitation ;" mark his words, " When I
</p>
<p>began this agitation." He arrogates here to himself, and very justly,
</p>
<p>the exclusive merit of introducing this agitation. " When I began
</p>
<p>il this agitation, I pointed to Emancipation, and I turned to the Irish
</p>
<p>" people, and told them I would like them to join me once more.
</p>
<p>" I now turn to you, and tell you I wish you to join me till you
</p>
<p>" put yourselves on an equality with Protestant and Presbyterian.
</p>
<p>" O yes; we look for nothing but equality. For a long time we
</p>
<p>" struggled for Emancipation in vain ; they said they never would
</p>
<p>" grant it. Peel swore he never would do it." Then he says :
</p>
<p>" Wholesale murders were committed." And then he goes into a
</p>
<p>long detail of transactions past. " I will put an end to that ; some-
</p>
<p>" thing must be done ; every one, Ministry and Opposition, admit
</p>
<p>" that something must be done. Why not do it at once ? I will
</p>
<p>" do it through Repeal, and work while they talk. Mr. Robinson
</p>
<p>" had another plan ; I have one of my own. I would not let the
</p>
<p>" landlords appoint valuators ; you might as well consult butchers
</p>
<p>" about selling meat in Lent. You will all be in favour of my plan
</p>
<p>" of fixture of tenure ; it is short and simple, and is founded in
</p>
<p>" justice and humanity. I will tell you what it is. No landlord
</p>
<p>" should recover rent unless he gave a lease. As I would say to
</p>
<p>" the parson, no penny no pater noster, so I would say to the land-
</p>
<p>" lord, no lease no rent. The lease may be as long as twenty-one
</p>
<p>" years, it might not be longer ; and I would give the tenant power to
</p>
<p>" go before the Assistant Barrister, if the land was set too high. You
</p>
<p>" know no one could register now, without a solvent tenant to swear
</p>
<p>" that he would give him ten pounds over and above the rent and

</p>
<p>" taxes. I would have an engineer appointed by the Government,
</p>
<p>" and he should decide what the tenant ought fairly to give, in order
</p>
<p>" that the landlord might be entitled to his rent. It might be said
</p>
<p>" that the landlord had the cure at the end of twenty-one years, but
</p>
<p>" I would allow the tenant to register, with the Clerk of the Peace,
</p>
<p>u every improvement he had made, after due notice given to the
</p>
<p>" landlord; just as at present, if the tenant plant trees he can regis-
</p>
<p>" ter them, and have the first cutting, even though he should be de-
</p>
<p>" prived of the land. Then the tenant would be enabled to build a
</p>
<p>" good cow-house for himself, and to build a better pig-sty than he
</p>
<p>" now inhabited himself, and the landlord should either give him a
</p>
<p>" new lease, or else pay him for every improvement he had made.
</p>
<p>" We do not want to turn the landlords adrift, but then they must
</p>
<p>" be in a hurry to join us, because we are about to carry Repeal im-
</p>
<p>" mediately ; and from this spot, which is about the centre of Ire-
</p>
<p>u land, I now call upon them to join me ; but if they do not, let them
</p>
<p>713
</p>
<p>" take care they do not regret it. Let them now come forward, and
</p>
<p>"join the people, and they will be paid more in respect, than they
</p>
<p>" are now paid in money. Did you ever see a good landlord that
</p>
<p>" you did not like him ? [Cries of ' never.'] No, never. It is true
</p>
<p>" that property has its rights, and it shall have them ; but it has
</p>
<p>" its duties, and shall perform them. Oh ! go home and circulate
</p>
<p>" the good news, that after centuries of oppression we shall obtain
</p>
<p>" freedom, because we deserve it. Spies and informers have in-
</p>
<p>'' vented the Ribbon society." He denounces the Ribbon society,
</p>
<p>and all secret societies (I admit that), on all occasions. " Let every
</p>
<p>" man that promises me he will catch a Ribbonman, hold up his
</p>
<p>" hand. Oh ! now I have your pledge, and no honest Irishman ever
</p>
<p>" broke his pledge. Have I not Teetotallers here ? ['Yes.'] I am
</p>
<p>" proud of your confidence ; I can collect you together at any time.
</p>
<p>" If I want you, I can get you any day in the week."
</p>
<p>Now it is possible that these words may have different meanings.
</p>
<p>It is for you to say what they mean : whether Mr. O'Connell in-
</p>
<p>tended to call these people together when an occasion should arrive
</p>
<p>for an outbreak, or whether he intended to have it understood in
</p>
<p>England, and over the country, that the people could be collected at
</p>
<p>any moment he thought fit, so as thereby to create that kind of
</p>
<p>coercion or intimidation, which we say he had in contemplation, as a
</p>
<p>means of procuring the Repeal of the Union. It may be capable of
</p>
<p>that signification as well as the other, and it is that latter one which
</p>
<p>would support the view the indictment takes of it. The object of
</p>
<p>this meeting was to hold out a state of things, to present an appear-
</p>
<p>ance to the people of England, and the country generally, which
</p>
<p>would have the effect of intimidating the Legislature, and procuring
</p>
<p>the Repeal of the Act of Parliament. The question is, how this
</p>
<p>language was understood by the people to whom it was addressed.
</p>
<p>We find, on this very occasion, a strong proof of the mode in which
</p>
<p>it was understood by them. "I can collect you together at any time.
</p>
<p>If I want you, I can get you any day in the week." [A voice, " The
</p>
<p>sooner you want us the better."^ How, I ask, did the person who made

<p>use of that expression understand Mr. O'Connell's language? Why,
</p>
<p>we are ready to do anything at any time you think fit. This was not the
</p>
<p>mere repealing an Act of Parliament ; it was a general invitation to
</p>
<p>assemble at any time he should call them, and the answer is, " the
</p>
<p>sooner you want us the better." Then he goes into the Grand Jury
</p>
<p>cess, and, after some other remarks, he says : " I am not deluding
</p>
<p>" you, but am able to prove in any Court, that these are the bles-
</p>
<p>" sings of Repeal : and it is impossible that the people of Ireland
</p>
<p>" can remain longer in slavery. I am able to demonstrate that the
</p>
<p>" people of Ireland are the most manly in the world, because distin-
</p>
<p>u guished professors in Spain and France have proved by tables, that
</p>
<p>" there is not such a people on the face of the earth ; and as for
</p>
<p>" civilization I claim the highest meed of praise for Irishmen. Oh !
</p>
<p>" little the Saxon knows that gentleness of manners that arises under
</p>
<p>" religious enthusiasm ; that forbearance that springs from the reli-
</p>
<p>" gious principle deeply impressed upon your hearts from your ear-
</p>
<p>4Y
</p>
<p>714
</p>
<p>" liest infancy. But it is that very religious forbearance that makes
</p>
<p>" you kind to each other, and that enables your women to come into
</p>
<p>" the greatest throngs without being injured, and certain of not be-
</p>
<p>** ing insulted. But if it should be necessary for you to remain in
</p>
<p>" the field till blood shall flow, general never stood by such soldiers;
</p>
<p>" I have the bravest and most moral people in the world to deal
</p>
<p>" with ; but you must combine, there must be no treachery among
</p>
<p>" you, and it is treachery to vote for any one but a Repealer. I
</p>
<p>" have heard of some parish in this county where some Repealers
</p>
<p>" voted for a Tory ; however, we will say no more about it at pre-
</p>
<p>" sent ; but now I give command never to vote for any Tory, nor
</p>
<p>u for one else but a Repealer." In a subsequent part of his speech,
</p>
<p>he explains what he means by this  " you must combine." You will
</p>
<p>understand from the subsequent passage, what is the kind of
</p>
<p>combination to which he alluded, and what is the kind of combi-
</p>
<p>nation that exists. " A friend of mine was coming down from Dublin,
</p>
<p>" and saw a man working in a kind of Botany Bay of his own, a
</p>
<p>" number of men were working together near him, but left him to
</p>
<p>" work in a part by himself, solitary and alone, and refused to hold
</p>
<p>" any intercourse with him. My friend was afraid that they be-
</p>
<p>" longed to some secret society, and addressing them said, that he
</p>
<p>" hoped that they were not Ribbonmen, that they refused to let that
</p>
<p>" poor fellow into their company; but what was their answer ?  Oh !
</p>
<p>" that fellow refused to become a Repealer.' These good men were
</p>
<p>*' combined for the cause of Repeal." That is to say, any person who
</p>
<p>did not join the combination was to be put into a kind of Botany Bay
</p>
<p>of his own ; he was to be excluded from the society and fellowship of
</p>
<p>the people about him, he was to be in short expatriated, put out of
</p>
<p>the pale of society, and compelled to join the ranks of combinators,
</p>
<p>as they are called, by this species of treatment. I ventured to say
</p>
<p>yesterday, that I thought there was evidence in the case to show,
</p>
<p>and accordingly expressed my opinion to be, that persons had been
</p>
<p>induced to join this combination by this species of coercion. Have I
</p>
<p>not here abundant proof in support of that observation? The kind

</p>
<p>of coercion is the banishing from the society of those about him any
</p>
<p>person who thinks fit to dissent from this movement, and refuses to
</p>
<p>join it. And this, Gentlemen, is what is called freedom of discus-
</p>
<p>sion. I protest I do think I am perfectly warranted in saying, that
</p>
<p>if anything was ever calculated to prevent freedom of discussion, it is
</p>
<p>the machinery and the proceedings of this Association, and the mode
</p>
<p>in which its objects are carried out. So far from promoting free dis-
</p>
<p>cussion, the necessary effect and object of it are to prevent free dis-
</p>
<p>cussion, and to coerce persons to join its objects and purposes.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, with regard to the Tullamore meeting, there was the
</p>
<p>evidence of a person of the name of Stewart, and other evidence, with
</p>
<p>respect to which it will be necessary for me just to make a few ob-
</p>
<p>servations. You will recollect that Mr. Stewart stated, that amongst
</p>
<p>the insignia, or banners, or inscriptions, which appeared at Tullamore,
</p>
<p>was one upon an arch  " Ireland, her Parliament, or the world in a
</p>
<p>blaze." The counsel for the traversers, when adverting to this
</p>
<p>715
</p>
<p>meeting, said, " Oh! we shall show that this was wholly without the
</p>
<p>" knowledge of Mr. O'Connell ; and so far from approving of it, he,
</p>
<p>" Mr. O'Connell, directed it to be taken down ; and Mr. Steele ac-
</p>
<p>" cordingly went and had it removed  insisted on its being taken
</p>
<p>" away, and it was removed accordingly." Gentlemen of the Jury,
</p>
<p>a person was called by the traversers, I do not now remember his
</p>
<p>name, Morgan, I believe it was, who certainly did prove that he took
</p>
<p>down, or assisted in taking down, this arch by the direction of Mr.
</p>
<p>Steele, about a quarter past eleven o'clock ; and that accordingly it
</p>
<p>was removed. But what appeared on the cross-examination of that
</p>
<p>man? He was asked, who put up this arch? Where was it? It
</p>
<p>was at the house, or opposite the house, of a painter of the name of
</p>
<p>Dean. Dean painted it, and put it up. Why did he do so ? The
</p>
<p>witness could not tell. Who desired him to do so ? He could not
</p>
<p>tell. Dean was the person applied to to take it down. " Dean said,
</p>
<p>" by whose authority ? at first he objected ; Dean said, by whose
</p>
<p>" authority ? Mr. Steele observed, by Mr. O'Connell's, who was
</p>
<p>" displeased with having it up. And, thereupon, Dean being satis-
</p>
<p>" fied by Mr. Steele, that it was Mr. O'Connell's desire that it should
</p>
<p>lt be taken down, consented to take it down, and it was accordingly
</p>
<p>" taken down." Therefore, I say, Dean was the person that had
</p>
<p>authority to take it down, and was applied to to take it down, and
</p>
<p>Dean refused to take it down until sanctioned by Mr. O'Connell's
</p>
<p>desire. This witness was asked  Do you know why this was put up?
</p>
<p>He could not tell. On his cross-examination what turned out? That
</p>
<p>that very Dean had came from Tullamore with him (Morgan) the
</p>
<p>night before, and was in town ; and where is Dean ? Had Dean
</p>
<p>been produced, and not Morgan, Dean could have told you by whose
</p>
<p>authority or direction, or for what reason, and at whose expense, this
</p>
<p>inscription was put up ; why it was put up ; who he, Dean, was j
</p>
<p>whether he was connected with the Association.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon.  I submit, my Lords, this is not legitimate ; the
</p>
<p>only evidence is that 
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin.  He might have told all this ; but the jury

</p>
<p>are not to infer it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon.  My friend, the Solicitor-General, has not aright
</p>
<p>to imagine these things. There is no connexion shown between us
</p>
<p>and Dean at all, not the slightest.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor- General  I am not surprised at the interruption
</p>
<p>that has taken place, because it is impossible for any man to over-esti-
</p>
<p>mate the weight of this part of the case. It is a perfectly legitimate
</p>
<p>topic for me to observe upon, perfectly within the rules of law ; and I
</p>
<p>do insist on my right to observe on it to the fullest extent the case
</p>
<p>calls for. I think scarcely any observations are too strong on this
</p>
<p>part of the case, with respect to keeping back evidence which might
</p>
<p>be material in the cause. Dean, the person who had authority to take
</p>
<p>it down, at whose house it was, and who probably had caused it to be
</p>
<p>put up ; that Dean is not produced. Suppose he had been produced,
</p>
<p>should we not have been at liberty to ask him certain questions with
</p>
<p>respect to the authority to put it up ; and if it turned out that Dean, or
</p>
<p>716
</p>
<p>any person connected with him, was promoting this meeting, would it
</p>
<p>not be evidence to go the jury of some authority to erect this arch ?
</p>
<p>I do not mean to say a previous authority by Mr. O'Connell, because
</p>
<p>many persons engaged in this combination with Mr. O'Connell, erro-
</p>
<p>neously, and mistakenly perhaps, go too far, and it becomes necessary
</p>
<p>to check them afterwards, by showing they have been indiscreet. It
</p>
<p>is, therefore, very likely, that when Mr. O'Connell saw this inscrip-
</p>
<p>tion, he thought it improper it should continue there, and he directed
</p>
<p>it to be taken down. But, Gentlemen of the Jury, it shows this
</p>
<p>clearly  what was the feeling of the people at that meeting, what
</p>
<p>were the sentiments entertained until they were discountenanced by
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, who had this taken down. I say the non-production
</p>
<p>of this person does furnish the strongest ground for my conjecturing,
</p>
<p>or for our conjecturing, that this Dean, if he had been produced,
</p>
<p>might have made this inscription, or this arch, distinctly evidence
</p>
<p>against these defendants. They attempt to get rid of the effect of
</p>
<p>this, by saying they will satisfactorily account for it, and satisfactorily
</p>
<p>prove the removal of it ; I admit they have proved the removal of it,
</p>
<p>but they have not satisfactorily accounted for the erection of it, it ap-
</p>
<p>pearing, on their own witness's evidence, that that was in their power.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I now come to the meeting at Baltinglass
</p>
<p>of the 6th of August; and we have some witnesses whose testimony
</p>
<p>with respect to that meeting appears to me to be of the greatest im-
</p>
<p>portance. We have, Gentlemen, the evidence of a person of the
</p>
<p>name of Henry Godfrey. He is in the constabulary, and was at Bal-
</p>
<p>tinglass on this occasion. He says he was stationed at Donard. " He
</p>
<p>" reached Baltinglass the evening before. He saw the people come
</p>
<p>" with bands playing in a waggon from Rathvilly. He saw the Rev.
</p>
<p>" Mr. Nolan there. He saw him when the people came in. They
</p>
<p>" had banners. The meeting was held a little outside the town, and
</p>
<p>" one man said : ' The shouts are frightening the pigeons ;' ' yes,' said
</p>
<p>" another, 'and the Protestants too.'" Now, Gentlemen, the lan-
</p>
<p>guage, the expressions, the conduct of the persons assembled at these
</p>
<p>meetings, are always admitted in evidence as indicative of the charac-
</p>

</p>
<p>ter of the meetings themselves; and you may judge from the expres-
</p>
<p>sions of these persons, what the feelings were by which the people
</p>
<p>were actuated who formed that assembly to receive Mr. O'Connell.
</p>
<p>" He heard this on the bridge, after the waggon had passed. He
</p>
<p>" heard a man say, ' That was the day that would frighten Saunders,"'
</p>
<p>a gentleman living in that neighbourhood. " He says he saw Mr.
</p>
<p>" O'Connell with the other gentleman whom he named, some clergy-
</p>
<p>" man ; and he says he heard Mr. O'Connell speak to this effect, ' that
</p>
<p>" 'he did not despair of getting the Repeal when he had the clergy
</p>
<p>" ' and people to back him. He was not going to tell them now what
</p>
<p>" 'he intended doing.'" You will see there is a regular progression
</p>
<p>of the plan and carrying out of this conspiracy, which the prime mover
</p>
<p>of it does not disclose until certain periods arrive. "He said some-
</p>
<p>" thing about their coming again. He said they must get the Repeal,
</p>
<p>" and could not be refused it, as they were all sober, determined
</p>
<p>717
</p>
<p>" men. He heard the Rev. Mr. Lawler say they should get the Re-
</p>
<p>" peal, and that there should be no tithes ; that if the clergy were
</p>
<p>" civil, and joined them, they should get the tithes for their natural
</p>
<p>" lives." He says, Gentlemen, that he recorded these expressions
</p>
<p>the same day. He is called on to read them from a book ; he pro-
</p>
<p>duced that book. He states he burned the original note. He fully
</p>
<p>explains that the report was perfectly accurate. But here, as in every
</p>
<p>other instance, there is no attempt to contradict, no reporter comes
</p>
<p>forward to show it is incorrect. Gentlemen, the next witness is a
</p>
<p>person of the name of Henry Twiss, and he says : " The number
</p>
<p>" of persons assembled was very great ; and he heard the people in
</p>
<p>" the crowd say, ' that Ireland was trampled on, but she shall be no
</p>
<p>" longer so.' And he heard this expression used, ' the time is
</p>
<p>" nearer than you think.' " Now, I leave it to you to judge
</p>
<p>what was brooding in the minds of the people, or of the man,
</p>
<p>at least, who made use of that expression to those about him,
</p>
<p>"the time is nearer than you think." " Let us wait with patience
</p>
<p>for a few months." But " a few months," would be the expiration
</p>
<p>of the session of Parliament. What was meant by that ? Was it, wait
</p>
<p>till a bill can be carried through Parliament, or a petition presented ?
</p>
<p>A person of the name of Lynam was then examined, and he says
</p>
<p>he heard Mr. O'Connell tell the people: "He was glad to see
</p>
<p>" them all there, and hoped they would be there when he came
</p>
<p>" again." Then Manus Hughes was examined, and he said : " He
</p>
<p>" had heard three or four say, that Mr. Saunders' house ought to be
</p>
<p>" attacked, because it was once the seat of blood. A man came
</p>
<p>" and said that Mr. O'Connell had ordered the coachman to pull
</p>
<p>" up at Saunders', and to give Mr. Saunders three cheers. He heard
</p>
<p>" part of Mr. O'Connell's speech. He heard him say he would do
</p>
<p>" away with the poor law and taxes, and have the poor supported
</p>
<p>" out of a consolidated fund. He heard the crowd say, ' that they
</p>
<p>" would and should have the Repeal.'" This was at the meeting.
</p>
<p>A person of the name of Taylor was also examined, and he says
</p>
<p>that he heard Mr. O'Connell say : " He was able to get the Repeal

</p>
<p>" if the people would stand by him. What a blessed thing it would
</p>
<p>" be to have an Irish Parliament." He then abused Lord Wicklow
</p>
<p>and Mr. Fenton, and said : " He was happy to see them there, and
</p>
<p>" asked if they would come again, if so, to put up their hands. They
</p>
<p>" all did so. He heard some say they would, and would willingly fight
</p>
<p>" for it. He heard others speak. A Mr. O'Reilly made mention of the
</p>
<p>" villainous English Government, who had sent them to perish in fo-
</p>
<p>" reign countries like Cabul. He said, ' devil's cure to them for go-
</p>
<p>" ing,' and that they should not expose themselves to it again. They
</p>
<p>" said they would not." There were other expressions which the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General stated ; but it appeared that the meeting had sepa-
</p>
<p>rated at the time, and they were not allowed to be given in evidence,
</p>
<p>and I merely advert to them, because one of the counsel for the tra-
</p>
<p>versers referred to that part of the Attorney-General's statement, and
</p>
<p>accused the Crown of having made a statement which they had not
</p>
<p>718
</p>
<p>proved. In point of fact evidence to that effect was offered, but there
</p>
<p>was an argument as to the reception of it, and the Court decided that
</p>
<p>it could not be admitted.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I must now call your attention a little more particu-
</p>
<p>larly, to a report of the proceedings at this meeting in the Freeman's
</p>
<p>Journal of the 7th of August. There is a very long account in Dr.
</p>
<p>Gray's paper, of this demonstration at Baltinglass. There is an his-
</p>
<p>torical account of the county of Wicklow, and a description of its na-
</p>
<p>tural beauties, and its advantages in a military point of view, and then
</p>
<p>there is a description of the mode in which the crowd assembled.
</p>
<p>" Temperance bands from Ballymore, Athy, Naas, and Newbridge,
</p>
<p>** Rathvilly, and from our own liberties, were contributing to the en-
</p>
<p>" joyment of the people. The Spitalfields bands  there were two in
</p>
<p>" two vehicles, drawn by four horses each  were marshalled by Mr.
</p>
<p>" Morgan Largan. More than a thousand horsemen added a military
</p>
<p>" dignity to the myriads of foot." Our witnesses are objected to, and
</p>
<p>they are blamed for making use of the word " military." For the
</p>
<p>order of organization of these people, the language they put forward
</p>
<p>themselves is: " More than a thousand horsemen added a military dig-
</p>
<p>" nity to the myriads of foot ; while cars and other vehicles were
</p>
<p>" crowded with females, cheerful and lovely, who were determined
</p>
<p>" that they should have some portion in the achievement of the do-
</p>
<p>" mestic felicity which will follow independence. At this period there
</p>
<p>" were present, in the neighbourhood of the place of meeting, as well
</p>
<p>" as in the town, 150,000 people. These had collected from the five
</p>
<p>" or six adjoining counties; and a more cheerful, fine, and manly pea-
</p>
<p>" santry the eye could not love to dwell on. Every moment caval-
</p>
<p>" cades were joining the procession. Procession joined procession,
</p>
<p>4< band followed band, thousand joined thousand, until the dense mass
</p>
<p>" of human beings became so compressed, that one man could not
</p>
<p>*' move in that multitude, but all waved like a corn field beneath the
</p>
<p>" passing breeze." Then, Gentlemen, in the speech delivered at the
</p>
<p>meeting, after lavishing a great deal of abuse on Lord Wicklow and
</p>
<p>Mr. Fenton, with which I shall not trouble you, Mr. O'Connell pro-

</p>
<p>ceeds thus : " He got emancipation for them in order to give the
</p>
<p>" people additional strength, but they could not get the benefit of
</p>
<p>" that strength until they had the Union repealed. He was there
</p>
<p>" exactly for the purpose Mr. Connor had described, and they were
</p>
<p>" there to back him in obtaining it ; and neither Wellington nor Na-
</p>
<p>" poleon ever had such a back as he had. A man was not more brave
</p>
<p>" because he wore a red coat ; for a frieze jacket can cover as good
</p>
<p>" and as brave a heart as scarlet or blue.'' That language, I submit
</p>
<p>" to you, Gentlemen, is sufficiently unequivocal. " If he wanted
</p>
<p>" them again, would they not be ready at his word ? Let every man
</p>
<p>" who was determined to meet him again on any future occasion,
</p>
<p>" where he would require his presence, for peaceable purposes, hold
</p>
<p>" up his hand." Then Mr. Lalor states: " He [Mr. Lalor] inquired
</p>
<p>what they meant by the new tariff?" He represents himself as hav-
</p>
<p>ing a conversation with certain Protestant clergymen. " He [Mr.
</p>
<p>719
</p>
<p>" Lalor] inquired what they meant by the new tariff; the tariff, they
</p>
<p>" said, that was got up in Connaught to cut down the priests' dues.
</p>
<p>11 Oh, said he [Mr. Lalor], don't halloo until you are out of the
</p>
<p>" wood ; we are not done with you yet. If you are civil, we will give
</p>
<p>" you a life interest in your tithes ; but if not, we shall apply them to
</p>
<p>" the support of the poor of the country." We shall. Whom the
</p>
<p>reverend gentleman meant by " we,'' I think you will have no diffi-
</p>
<p>culty in conjecturing, when you shall have heard what the constitu-
</p>
<p>tion of this new Irish Parliament is to be.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, at the dinner on this occasion, Mr. O'Connell made
</p>
<p>a speech. " We will not enter into any compromise of any
</p>
<p>' kind ; and we feel that Ireland wants all her sons to stand
</p>
<p>' by her at the present moment [great cheers]  and if they
</p>
<p>" have no other or better leader than myself, I will myself stand by
</p>
<p>" the people, and the people will stand by me [tremendous cheer-
</p>
<p>" ing.j" Does that allude to the presenting of petitions to the Par-
</p>
<p>liament for the Repeal of the Act of Legislative Union ? Does he
</p>
<p>mean a leader in the House of Commons? Does he mean a leader
</p>
<p>in signing petitions ? Or does he mean a leader in the field ? How
</p>
<p>was this understood ? " Tremendous cheering. A voice  'That will
</p>
<p>" do.' Mr. O'Connell  Yes, that will do. [Cheers]. You know
</p>
<p>" that I will not allow you to violate any law. If my advice be taken
</p>
<p>" you will not be in the power of your enemies. Remember, my
</p>
<p>" motto is  ' Whoever commits a crime gives strength to the enemy.'
</p>
<p>" [Cheers.] That is the doctrine we preach everywhere, and we will
</p>
<p>" soon have three millions of men who have preached and practised
</p>
<p>" it, and I tell you that no statesmen ever lived who could resist a po-
</p>
<p>" pulation of that kind. [Cheers.] But we must persevere. Those
</p>
<p>" meetings I intend to go on with until such time that no part of Ire-
</p>
<p>" land shall not have pronounced, as they say in Spain, or shall have
</p>

<p>" class of men, and effected that revolution ; but in the British ser-
</p>
<p>** vice they are the finest, the most intelligent, and the most trust-
</p>
<p>" worthy men that ever existed. In every other service the sergeants
</p>
<p>" are made officers of ; but in the British service they have not yet
</p>
<p>" learned to do that act of justice ; but if our cause goes on, we will
</p>
<p>" do them this piece of service [hear, and cheers]  that the Govern-
</p>
<p>" ment will alter their plan, and appoint a great many of the sergeants
</p>
<p>" to commissions, for fear they would pronounce ; and I give them
</p>
<p>" advice to do so from this spot." Gentlemen, I shall not further dwell
</p>
<p>upon that meeting. Recollect, that the question with respect to all
</p>
<p>these proceedings is, what is the object that the parties had in view ?
</p>
<p>Now, bearing that in mind, I must call your attention to the next
</p>
<p>piece of evidence in point of date, which is a publication of the 12th
</p>
<p>of August in the Nation. It seems to be a leading article in that
</p>
<p>paper, adverting to the position of the Repeal question at that
</p>
<p>time. The writer goes on " Let us see what has been done and
</p>
<p>720
</p>
<p>" what remains. What were we a year ago ? The squabbling
</p>
<p>" and impotent serfs of England. Here a master mind, and there
</p>
<p>" a heart prophetic with enthusiasm, foresaw the time when a peo-
</p>
<p>" pie owning all that gives the power to be a nation, would scorn
</p>
<p>" to serve. They foretold that eight millions, with all that en-
</p>
<p>" forces independence upon man, with the oldest and most varied
</p>
<p>" history in Europe, with the deepest wrongs, and having their old
</p>
<p>" wronger for their present tyrant; with a home marked apart by
</p>
<p>" the ocean ; with limitless misery and limitless resources ; were des-
</p>
<p>" tined to be admirable and strong among the nations of the earth."
</p>
<p>This is Mr. Duffy's, or his correspondent's description of the state of the
</p>
<p>Repeal question, and the motives to induce those who were engaged
</p>
<p>in it to go on with the prosecution of it : " The Repeal rent was
</p>
<p>" fifty or a hundred pounds a-week, it is now on an average fifteen
</p>
<p>" hundred. The enrolled Repealers were scarcely a couple of hun-
</p>
<p>" dred thousand, they are now running towards two millions. It had
</p>
<p>" then half a dozen Protestant members, it has now thousands, from
</p>
<p>" the wealthiest of the gentry to the most stern of the democracy
</p>
<p>" The entire Catholic hierarchy and priesthood have given it open
</p>
<p>" support or tacit assent. There is no one worth naming in Ireland
</p>
<p>" actively hostile to it. Most of the counties of Leinster and Mun-
</p>
<p>" ster, and some in Ulster and Connaught, have come in masses
</p>
<p>" together, to declare that they are ready to make any sacrifice,
</p>
<p>" money, repose, or life, to achieve their independence." This is
</p>
<p>the peaceful, moral combination of the will of the people, peaceably
</p>
<p>shown, and having no other than a peaceable object ! Here is the
</p>
<p>newspaper of one of these traversers sanctioning what has taken
</p>
<p>place ; adverting to it, pointing out the mode by which it is to be ac-
</p>
<p>complished, and the ends it was likely to serve. Then he goes on :
</p>
<p>" There is nothing recorded in history like this display. The
</p>
<p>" numbers of these meetings were unequalled in any population.
</p>
<p>" The time, and labour, and loss suffered by the people in their long
</p>
<p>" marches to them, were never before voluntarily borne, save in the
</p>
<p>tl excitement of war. But the order observed in coming and going

</p>
<p>" the organization necessary to produce such order  the serious good
</p>
<p>" temper  the absence of riot or vice  made each of these meetings a
</p>
<p>" strange and formidable event." The very " absence of riot and
</p>
<p>disorder" made the meeting " a strange and formidable event ;" that
</p>
<p>very absence of riot and disorder being now the only plausible argu-
</p>
<p>ment put forward by these traversers, as a vindication for these'proceed-
</p>
<p>ings and meetings. Now attend to this: " There was a time when
</p>
<p>" such meetings might have been plausibly resisted by our despots,
</p>
<p>" and the country forced into a premature contest. Now there is no
</p>
<p>" such danger." That is the effect of the organization ; that is the
</p>
<p>effect of the serious good temper ; that is the effect of the sobriety,
</p>
<p>and the absence of any breach of the law, the absence of any ten-
</p>
<p>dency to riot or disturbance of the public peace. " The meetings
</p>
<p>** have been held, and no single event has occurred to furnish the
</p>
<p>" worst Minister with an excuse for preventing their repetition. The
</p>
<p>" stopping of them might hazard public peace  not on the instant" 
</p>
<p>721
</p>
<p>" ' not on the instant'  for the people know their policy too well for
</p>
<p>" that." This is the morality inculcated on the people : it is most
</p>
<p>desirable you should not violate the peace, or commit a crime, not
</p>
<p>because the law prohibits it, but because it is not your policy to do so
</p>
<p>at present. " But such oppressions might ultimately produce war.
</p>
<p>" The continuance of them has caused no offence; the repetition of
</p>
<p>" them prevents crime, by giving the people hope from a higher source
</p>
<p>" than parish law, and surer justice than revenge. No power dare
</p>
<p>" interfere with those meetings now If the Repeal organiza-
</p>
<p>" tion, by general, provincial, and baronial Inspectors, by Wardens
</p>
<p>" and Collectors, by Volunteers, Members, and Associates, has any effi-
</p>
<p>" ciency in it, it will now have a fair trial. A far inferior machinery,
</p>
<p>" though checked and hampered, carried Emancipation. The present
</p>
<p>" organization will be extended to every parish in Ireland, and per-
</p>
<p>" fected in every parish. The whole nation will be arrayed under
</p>
<p>" that system. There is a full purpose in the minds of the Repeal
</p>
<p>u leaders not to rest until it is carried out. The people will gradu-
</p>
<p>" ally, but surely, be arranged, classed, organized, and bound toge-
</p>
<p>" ther. Subordination of ranks, community of thought, obedience to
</p>
<p>" orders, firm trust in those who command, constant activity in teach-
</p>
<p>" ing and learning the means of liberation, are rapidly becoming
</p>
<p>" general. Nor will the organization stop at arraying the people in
</p>
<p>" their parishes, and massing them all under one will; it will every
</p>
<p>" day extend its operations. It has resources in it to advance as well
</p>
<p>" as to maintain itself." Now attend to this: it is said that the act
</p>
<p>of one person, or the declaration of one person, is only to be visited
</p>
<p>on himself; that it would be a cruel thing to visit upon Dr. Gray the
</p>
<p>act of Mr. O'Connell, or the speech of Mr. O'Connell ; or on Mr.
</p>
<p>Duffy the publication of Dr. Gray. Here we have, you will find,
</p>
<p>Dr. Gray most active in the Arbitration part of this case. And here
</p>
<p>we have Mr. Duffv, in the Nation, publishing the article which lam
</p>
<p>now reading, containing this passage : " Arbitrators will be appointed
</p>
<p>in every barony." How did Mr. Duffy know that ? How could he know
</p>
<p>it, except there was a community of purpose and design between him

</p>
<p>and Dr. Gray, and the other persons who were connected with getting
</p>
<p>up these Arbitration Courts ? I mention that as one of the thousand
</p>
<p>instances of the community of purpose in this case. Then again, he
</p>
<p>alludes to another subject, which you will presently find more fully
</p>
<p>developed in the combination, but which at this time the writer of this
</p>
<p>article certainly knew was in contemplation. " How soon the three
</p>
<p>" hundred trustees of the Irish fund will come to Dublin we need not
</p>
<p>" anticipate. Suffice it, they will come, and ice fancy their advice will
</p>
<p>" pass for law with the people." Now you will hear by and by what
</p>
<p>these three hundred trustees were intended to be ; and here you find
</p>
<p>Mr. Duffy telling the people of Ireland, that when these three hun-
</p>
<p>dred trustees shall have assembled in Dublin, he takes for granted
</p>
<p>that what they say will be law for the Irish people. Your Lordships
</p>
<p>will have it explained hereafter. I am at present adverting to it, to
</p>
<p>show the cognizance of the writer of this article, of the intention of
</p>
<p>having the trustees of this fund put into operation. Now, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>4z
</p>
<p>722
</p>
<p>it is desirable we should see what is meant by Ireland being a nation,
</p>
<p>an expression that has been used often, both by the defendants and
</p>
<p>by the counsel who have addressed you on their behalf. Mr. Duffy,
</p>
<p>in his publication, gives you, I think, a definition of what he under-
</p>
<p>stands by the Irish being a nation. " Ireland is changing into a
</p>
<p>" nation. She is obtaining all the machinery of one  public opinion,
</p>
<p>" order, taxation." " Taxation, justice, legislation." " Taxation"
</p>
<p>is the Repeal fund, "justice "the Arbitration Courts, " Legisla-
</p>
<p>tion" the dictates of the three hundred trustees, who, this writer
</p>
<p>fancies, will give law to the Irish people. That is what is meant by
</p>
<p>the phrase of Ireland being a nation. This is not my language,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, but the language of the traversers. " What
</p>
<p>" will be wanting when the work is done, but to call her what she
</p>
<p>" then will be  a nation ? When Grattan walked into the Com-
</p>
<p>" mons in his Volunteer uniform, and proposed liberty, he had less
</p>
<p>" power at his back than O'Connell will then have, or indeed has
</p>
<p>" now. He had the armed and clothed, but unstained Volunteers,
</p>
<p>" and he succeeded. He had none of the machinery of a Government
</p>
<p>" in his hands."  "He hadnone of the machinery of a Government in
</p>
<p>his hands." " And his thousands in bright array had no elements
</p>
<p>of success but courage and arms. We are better off now." Better
</p>
<p>off than Grattan when he marched with his armed Volunteers. "We
</p>
<p>will before another year be infinitely stronger." Then comes this
</p>
<p>passage : " W T e have an organization well understood by the peo-
</p>
<p>ple." That is the organization, observe, that Mr. Duffy adverts
</p>
<p>to. The organization of the people, understood by the people, is that
</p>
<p>species of organization which they were called on at the meeting to assist
</p>
<p>in, and of which they demonstrated their understanding by their ex-
</p>
<p>pressions : " the sooner you want us the better." That is the organization
</p>
<p>well understood by the people, " and applicable to any national exi-
</p>
<p>gency." Any national exigency ! " We have an indestructible tie
</p>
<p>" binding the highest and the lowest for a common end; we have many
</p>
<p>" even of the accessaries of national pomp  our bands, for instance ;
</p>
<p>" we have education, temperance, and patient resolve ; we will, when

</p>
<p>" our system is finished, have the form as well as the bulk of a na-
</p>
<p><c tion; who, then, will dare to question our independence? We
</p>
<p>u need not again refer to the state of our foreign policy." You
</p>
<p>miorhtwell suppose, Gentlemen, that this was the delivery of a Speech
</p>
<p>from the Throne ; the head of the Government of a distinct, inde-
</p>
<p>pendent state, laying before the subjects of it an expose of its policy."
</p>
<p>" We need not again refer to our foreign policy. That policy has
</p>
<p>" grown up without the tricks of diplomacy from the sympathy felt
</p>
<p>" for our sufferings, our virtues, and our hopes ; and it has been con-
</p>
<p>" firmed by the obvious interest Europe and America have in the
</p>
<p>" freedom of Ireland." What is the interest Europe and America
</p>
<p>have in the freedom of Ireland, except as a separate state ? What
</p>
<p>have Europe or America otherwise to say to that ? But they have
</p>
<p>a great deal, or might have a great deal, to say to the separation of
</p>
<p>Ireland from England. " The declaration of disciplined masses in
</p>
<p>" America, that if lawless force were to come upon Ireland, their
</p>
<p>723
</p>
<p>l> sword would mix in the fray, and the well-understood will"  that
</p>
<p>is, well understood in this country  " And the well understood will
</p>
<p>" of the finest spirits and most potent citizens of France, not to let
</p>
<p>" us contend alone, are full of warning to England. But their first
</p>
<p>" service is to diminish the likelihood of a contest. He will be a bold
</p>
<p>" Minister who believes that the professions of France and America
</p>
<p>" are not an idle boast, and yet draws his sword against Ireland.
</p>
<p>" We have some chance now, notwithstanding the hot words of the
</p>
<p>" fallen Henry Brougham, that we will be allowed to work out
</p>
<p>" our liberties unrestricted. This chance is in part owing to our
</p>
<p>" foreign relations. Nor is England combined against us. Her
</p>
<p>" people groan under the sway that ruins us. The successors of
</p>
<p>" the Norman aristocracy still monopolize their land and harass
</p>
<p>" their industry ; and they begin to murmur that they will not legis-
</p>
<p>" late nor fight against us. But, again we tell Ireland she must free
</p>
<p>" herself by her own might. We have much to do. After all that
</p>
<p>" has been done, we are only at the gate of the temple. Ere we
</p>
<p>" reach the altar we must overcome many a foe, and correct many a
</p>
<p>" vice, and we must bear, and battle, and be steadfast. The organi-
</p>
<p>" zation must not only be carried everywhere, but it must be revised
</p>
<p>" everywhere. If the Repeal Wardens of any district do not see
</p>
<p>" that the organization, division, and training of all the ltepealers in
</p>
<p>" their district is perfect." " Training !" Now, observe, the duties
</p>
<p>of the Repeal Wardens are continuing duties. The Repeal Wardens
</p>
<p>have been appointed months ago  when first, I do not know  they
</p>
<p>have been a long time in operation, and part of their duty is to train
</p>
<p>the people. Am I to be told that training means for the mere pur-
</p>
<p>pose of enabling a number of persons, who may assemble at a par-
</p>
<p>ticular meeting, to go orderly and quietly, and to prevent confusion?
</p>
<p>That can be done when the meeting is called, but what is the
</p>
<p>meaning of training, as part of the systematic duty of the Repealer ?
</p>
<p>" If they are not sure that the people are qualified, by simplicity and
</p>
<p>" completeness of organization, by self-denying obedience, by a
</p>
<p>" knowledge of all a citizen's duties, by courage and habitual order,

</p>
<p>* to take their place among the men of a free nation  these Wardens
</p>
<p>" have not finished their duty  that district is not ready for liberty."
</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen of the Jury, I do protest that it appears to me, that
</p>
<p>we are not calling upon you in this case to do any thing but to be-
</p>
<p>lieve the language, and act upon the professed, and deliberate, and
</p>
<p>undisguised opinions and sentiments of the traversers themselves,
</p>
<p>when we ask you to find them guilty of the charges against them.
</p>
<p>What does that paper amount to ? Is it not a distinct allegation that
</p>
<p>Ireland is to be a nation, to have administration, justice, and tax-
</p>
<p>ation ; that the duty of the Repeal Wardens was to train the people ;
</p>
<p>that until that training was complete, the Repeal Wardens' duty was
</p>
<p>not done ; that the thing was progressing ; that in a very short time it
</p>
<p>would be perfect; that foreign policy had been adopted, that foreign
</p>
<p>countries, not in the way of diplomacy, had been applied to, but their
</p>
<p>sympathies had been enlisted and might be calculated on ; and that
</p>
<p>he must be a bold Minister of England who would dare to cope with
</p>
<p>724
</p>
<p>the Irish people in war, assured, as he must be, of the sympathy and
</p>
<p>support they would receive from Europe and America, and particu-
</p>
<p>larly from France ?
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I now approach a part of this case which bears more
</p>
<p>particularly on one of the traversers, and for whom Mr. Moore ap-
</p>
<p>peared as counsel ; I mean, Gentlemen, the Reverend Mr. Tierney.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore has stated Mr. Tierney to be a clergyman of the parish
</p>
<p>of Clontibret, in the county of Monaghan ; and he has stated him to
</p>
<p>be a most respectable gentleman, enjoying the good opinion of his
</p>
<p>friends and neighbours, and to be a person of high character in that
</p>
<p>part of the country. I am quite ready to believe that all this is well
</p>
<p>founded in point of fact ; I do not mean at all to question the correct-
</p>
<p>ness of that opinion ; and it is certainly with great regret, I must say,
</p>
<p>that I find myself counsel against a gentleman of Mr. Tierney's sacred
</p>
<p>character and profession. I also freely admit, with Mr. Moore, that
</p>
<p>the circumstances in the case which affect Mr. Tierney are, in some
</p>
<p>degree, distinguishable from those that relate to the other traversers;
</p>
<p>inasmuch as the only two occasions on which we find him distinctly
</p>
<p>prominent in this common combination, were the two  at Clontibret,
</p>
<p>on the 15th of August, and at the Association it) Dublin, on the 3rd
</p>
<p>of October. Whether the circumstances of the case, as relating to
</p>
<p>Mr. Tierney, so far make a distinction between him and the other
</p>
<p>traversers, as to authorize the jury to take a more favourable view
</p>
<p>of his case than of the others, it is not for me to say ; but when the
</p>
<p>jury come to consider the facts and circumstances, which it is now my
</p>
<p>duty to call to their attention, they will see that Mr. Tierney has, to
</p>
<p>a great extent, to a certain extent at least, mixed himself up with the
</p>
<p>objects and purposes of this body.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, with respect to Mr. Tierney, you will recollect that
</p>
<p>a witness of the name of M'Cann was examined, Mr. M'Cann is a
</p>
<p>member of the constabulary force, and very strong observations were
</p>
<p>made, tending to impeach his character and veracity. He stated,
</p>
<p>" that he saw Mr. Tierney at the Clontibret meeting, which took
</p>
<p>place on the 15th of August." At that meeting Mr. O'Neill Daunt was

</p>
<p>present, and Mr. Tierney spoke very briefly. He says : " That the
</p>
<p>" chairman was a gentleman of the name of Captain Seaver ; that a
</p>
<p>" Mr. Jackson was there, and Mr. Conway, the editor of the Newry
</p>
<p>(i Examiner. Mr. Tierney said the Union was carried by every spe-
</p>
<p>" cies of fraud and corruption. He says he saw Mr. Tierney some
</p>
<p>" time before the meeting; that he had a conversation with him as
</p>
<p>" to the meeting." Mr. M'Cann had been desired, by his superior
</p>
<p>officer, to ascertain what day the meeting was to take place at Clon-
</p>
<p>tibret, in order that the police might be in readiness, in case of ne-
</p>
<p>cessity, and for that purpose he called on Mr. Tierney ; and Mr. Tier-
</p>
<p>ney, in answer to the question, said : " The day was not yet fixed ; it
</p>
<p>" depended on the convenience of some barristers, for whom he had
</p>
<p>" sent or written." Now, it is perfectly plain, if you believe this wit-
</p>
<p>ness's statement, that Mr. Tierney was, to some extent, connected
</p>
<p>with that meeting, and that he had written to barristers to attend at
</p>
<p>725
</p>
<p>it, and, until their answer was received, he could not tell M'Cann the
</p>
<p>exact day. He then said : " That the Union was not binding on con-
</p>
<p>" science ; and he talked as to the feeling of Repeal, that it was be-
</p>
<p>" coming general, that it had extended to the army, and that they
</p>
<p>" participated in the enthusiasm of the people." This was the way
</p>
<p>that I took down his evidence : " That they could not be induced to
</p>
<p>" bayonet their fellow-subjects, and that they would not be so easily
</p>
<p>" led to bayonet l heir fellow-men for seeking a redress of their griev-
</p>
<p>" ances peaceably." And he referred to what the army had done
</p>
<p>in Spain. This, the witness said, was on the 16th of June. Mr.
</p>
<p>Tierney said: ** See what the army did in Spain." He talked of the
</p>
<p>Association, and said : " If it failed in its object, it had done so much
</p>
<p>at least, that the country should get other measures than the bayonet."
</p>
<p>He, M'Cann, was then cross-examined by Mr. Moore, the counselfor
</p>
<p>Mr. Tierney, and he stated that he took a note of this conversation,
</p>
<p>so far as related to the fixing of the day, because that he was to report
</p>
<p>to his superior officer ; but he did not take a note as to what Mr.
</p>
<p>Tierney said as to the army in Spain, but he was perfectly positive
</p>
<p>the words were used. He then produced his note, and said it was
</p>
<p>taken on the 16th of June, the day of the conversation ; that he saw
</p>
<p>the diary into which he entered it shortly afterwards. And he said
</p>
<p>that Mr. Tierney had assisted him in keeping the peace, and in ac-
</p>
<p>quainting him with the names of certain offenders ; and I make no
</p>
<p>doubt whatever that Mr. Tierney would feel it his duty, and act on
</p>
<p>it, to assist in that as far as he possibly could. The witness said he had
</p>
<p>not thought it necessary to insert this conversation with Mr. Tierney
</p>
<p>in the diary, because it had no immediate reference or relation to the
</p>
<p>subject on which he was sent. Now, very strong comments were made
</p>
<p>upon this man's evidence, not merely because he did not insert this
</p>
<p>in the diary, but his veracity was assailed by Mr. Moore, on this
</p>
<p>ground, that it was impossible this transaction could have taken place,
</p>
<p>or that Mr. Tierney should have so expressed himself, because the
</p>
<p>transactions in Spain were not then known in Ireland. You will re-
</p>
<p>collect this, Gentlemen. Mr. Moore said, if you look to the news-

<p>papers, the movement, or the pronouncement, had not taken place till
</p>
<p>the 11th, and the news of it had not arrived in Ireland till the 19th
</p>
<p>of June, and this conversation took place on the 16th of June;
</p>
<p>therefore this man must be swearing falsely. Now, that was a very
</p>
<p>strong aspersion to make on this person's character ; a person occu-
</p>
<p>pying a situation in the constabulary, that he was stating what was
</p>
<p>not true, and could not have been true at the time. If you will have
</p>
<p>the goodness to look at the Morning Chronicle of the 1st of June,
</p>
<p>you will find an allusion distinctly to the revolution in Spain.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell.  I must object to the suggestion of the Solicitor-
</p>
<p>General. He must comment on the evidence, and nothing else than
</p>
<p>the evidence. My friend is going into a rebutting case.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  If what the Solicitor-General states
</p>
<p>now is correct, Mr. Moore had no right to state it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell.  It may be open to the Solicitor-General to ob-
</p>
<p>726
</p>
<p>serve on the statement of counsel, and its not having been substanti-
</p>
<p>ated in proof.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  Mr. Moore has made no objection
</p>
<p>to any statement on the part of the Crown, but he said the witness
</p>
<p>could not have sworn the truth, because the news could not have
</p>
<p>arrived in Ireland at the time. What right had Mr. Moore to say
</p>
<p>that ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell.  Supposing he stated that, I am perfectly in pos-
</p>
<p>session of what the Court means; and the question is now, whether
</p>
<p>I am right in the observation I am going to take the liberty of sub-
</p>
<p>mitting to your Lordship. The trial must take the same course as
</p>
<p>any other trial. It is said that Mr. Moore impugned the accuracy or tes-
</p>
<p>timony of the witness, because he was stating the substance of a con-
</p>
<p>versation relating to a matter on which there could not be any know-
</p>
<p>ledge or information in this country. Mr. Moore made that state-
</p>
<p>ment, and he adverted to some particular documents, which he said
</p>
<p>would bear him out in that statement. However, in the course of
</p>
<p>the defence no evidence was given of the existence of those docu-
</p>
<p>ments. That is like every other statement which a counsel for a
</p>
<p>defendant, or a prisoner, or a traverser makes, subject afterwards
</p>
<p>to the observation that it is a statement made without proof. No
</p>
<p>proof has been given of it ; and I do not think any instance has
</p>
<p>occurred in which, if the counsel for a defendant makes a statement,
</p>
<p>which subsequently fails, and he does not think proper to sustain it by
</p>
<p>evidence, that is to be taken as a fact proved.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  Probably you are quite right in
</p>
<p>the view you take of it. The result is the same, and Mr. Moore's
</p>
<p>observation falls to the ground. That observation is brought forward
</p>
<p>by the Solicitor-General in the absence of any evidence on his part,
</p>
<p>and his case is established.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell.  It is quite open to the Solicitor- General to take
</p>
<p>the view your Lordship has adverted to, but no other.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor- General.  I should not even have gone so far, but
</p>
<p>that Mr. Moore deviated on this occasion from what I think is the

<p>ordinary and regular practice ; and that is, when counsel states a
</p>
<p>fact, generally speaking, he does so with reference to the proof he
</p>
<p>intends to give of it. But, on this occasion, your Lordships will
</p>
<p>recollect, Mr. Moore said, " If you, Gentlemen of the Jury, will
</p>
<p>" take the trouble of looking at a newspaper of the 1 1th of June, you
</p>
<p>" will find this statement could not be true." So that I did not sup-
</p>
<p>pose he intended to give the newspaper in evidence, but he left it to
</p>
<p>the jury.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  I think he did not go farther than
</p>
<p>to say : " If you take the trouble to look at the newspapers, you will
</p>
<p>see his assertion is not true."
</p>
<p>The Solicitor- General.  Very well. Mr. Moore has made a state-
</p>
<p>ment which is utterly unfounded  unproved, and, therefore, I have a
</p>
<p>right to say, unfounded. When a witness is produced on this table,
</p>
<p>727
</p>
<p>a respectable man, who, on his oath, swears that on a particular occa-
</p>
<p>sion a certain conversation took place, and when counsel on the oppo-
</p>
<p>site side charge that witness with deliberate perjury, and say that
</p>
<p>there are newspapers, or other evidence to show he has sworn falsely,
</p>
<p>am I to be stopped afterwards, when the proof fails, and is not given
</p>
<p> am I to be debarred the right of saying that that is an unfounded
</p>
<p>charge? It is for the sake of this man, as much as the merits of this
</p>
<p>case, that I assert my right so to do. I say that man has been falsely
</p>
<p>traduced. That conversation is proved ; and what is it? It couples
</p>
<p>Mr. Tierney with these proceedings, and also assigns to him certain
</p>
<p>opinions with respect to the movement in Spain, which bear a very
</p>
<p>strong affinity with those of the other traversers included in the in-
</p>
<p>dictment.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, that took place on the 15th of August. But, on the
</p>
<p>same day, there was another transaction in another part of the
</p>
<p>country, which is one of the most striking and remarkable in this very
</p>
<p>remarkable case. I allude to the meeting at Tara, which took place
</p>
<p>on the 15th of August, the same day as the Clontibret meeting, at
</p>
<p>which Mr. Tierney attended.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, before I direct your particular attention to certain
</p>
<p>passages in the speeches delivered on that occasion, which, as it ap-
</p>
<p>pears to me, develope the still further progress of this conspiracy, I
</p>
<p>think it right to call your attention to some parol evidence as to what
</p>
<p>occurred at the meeting itself. You will recollect that Captain Des-
</p>
<p>pard was examined, who attended there, not as a magistrate, but as
</p>
<p>an individual, and saw a good deal of what occurred. Gentlemen, I
</p>
<p>shall beg to trouble you first, with some parts of his evidence, and,
</p>
<p>next, to direct your attention to the very extraordinary mode which
</p>
<p>has been resorted to, for the purpose  I do not know whether I
</p>
<p>should say of contradicting  but of neutralizing his evidence. Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, a more intelligent witness, or a more respectable one, never
</p>
<p>appeared. He has been a distinguished magistrate for many years
</p>
<p>in the county of Meath. He was at the meeting. He was first at
</p>
<p>Trim in the morning. He says : " There was a large body of persons

</p>
<p>" assembling at Trim, who marched through the town towards Tara.
</p>
<p>" They formed on the Green of Trim, and marched through the town
</p>
<p>" in ranks of four deep. There were bands in a carriage, and some
</p>
<p>" people on horseback. Some had wands, whom he understood to be
</p>
<p>" Repeal Wardens. He went to the end of the town and heard the
</p>
<p>" leaders say, ' keep your ranks.' They had to march a distance of
</p>
<p>" six miles to Tara. I know," says he, " there were persons from
</p>
<p>" Kildare at Tara, and one from Wexford, some from Dublin, and
</p>
<p>" some from Westmeath. One man said he came from Nenagh. I
</p>
<p>" was at Tara some time before Mr. O'Connell's arrival, and various
</p>
<p>" parties came up with bands and flags flying. I think," he says,
</p>
<p>" there were at least one hundred thousand men." Captain Des-
</p>
<p>pard is a military man, and formed, therefore, probably a very good
</p>
<p>judgment as to the number of persons assembled on that occasion.
</p>
<p>728
</p>
<p>" I think I am under the mark. There were about seven thousand
</p>
<p>*' horsemen. I counted nineteen bands. The meeting concluded at
</p>
<p>" about two o'clock, or half-past, when there was a sudden move-
</p>
<p>*' ment at that time, and they went away in bodies of about twenty
</p>
<p>" thousand each." And then, Gentlemen, he details a most remark-
</p>
<p>able transaction, to which I beg to call your particular attention.
</p>
<p>" I was standing on the ditch when the procession was coming up;
</p>
<p>" a person said to me, it is not gentlemen that O'Connell wants here.
</p>
<p>'* I looked at him and said, who does he want? The man said, ' he
</p>
<p>" ' wants men of bone and sinew like me, who are able to do the
</p>
<p>" ' work for him.'" Bone and sinew work ! " I said,  I suppose
</p>
<p>" ' such men as these frieze-coated men.' He said, 'just so,' I said,
</p>
<p>" ' where do you come from ?' He said, ' he had come from Shilma-
</p>
<p>" Her, in Wexford.' I said, ' did any one come with you ?' He said,
</p>
<p>" ' two thousand, and that three thousand had joined at Kildare, from
</p>
<p>" another part of the country.' He said, ' you did not take off
</p>
<p>" your hat to Mr. O'Connell.' I said, ' no, I had not.' He said,
</p>
<p>" ' you do not belong to our party.' I said, ' certainly not, I did not
</p>
<p>" belong to any party.' He said, 'I knew by the curl of your lip
</p>
<p>" that you did not.' I said, ' I was amusing myself there.' He said,
</p>
<p>" ' Oh, well, well, we will let you come in for all that.' A man
</p>
<p>" came up and told him to let me alone." Then he says : " I heard
</p>
<p>" them cry out, long life to the foreigners; we will never get the
</p>
<p>" Repeal without the foreigners." Now, Gentlemen of the Jury, it
</p>
<p>was impossible not to be struck with the value and the weight of this
</p>
<p>testimony, on this part of the case ; and accordingly, there was no
</p>
<p>kind of expedient that was not resorted to, for the purpose of neu-
</p>
<p>tralizing that evidence. We have the different counsel taking up
</p>
<p>each and every of these distinct grounds, for the purpose of getting
</p>
<p>rid of Captain Despard's testimony. My friend, Mr. Hatchell, said,
</p>
<p>" it is a mere quiz; I know Shilmalier very well, it is a long way
</p>
<p>" from Tara. This was some fellow who had hoaxed Captain Des-
</p>
<p>" paid ; it was all a quiz ;" and he hoped to be able to produce the
</p>
<p>man ; so said Mr. Hatchell, or some one.

</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell.  No ; certainly not.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor- General.  Some one said, we hope to produce the
</p>
<p>very man who had this conversation with Captain Despard  remem-
</p>
<p>ber that, Gentlemen  and he will tell you either that he never had
</p>
<p>such a conversation, or that when he did say it, he was only hoaxing
</p>
<p>Captain Despard. But he has not been called. They forgot that.
</p>
<p>But what said Mr. Fitzgibbon ? and this does infinite credit to his in-
</p>
<p>genuity : Mr. Fitzgibbon said : " Oh ! Captain Despard is not
</p>
<p>" corroborated. Major Westenra is not produced. There was a
</p>
<p>" policeman of the name of Walker ; he is not produced. What may
</p>
<p>" have been probably the case? Why they may have placed this
</p>
<p>" puppet behind the ditch to address this conversation to Captain
</p>
<p>" Despard, in order that Captain Despard might have it to prove on
</p>
<p>" the trial." Now, T really was astonished, I must say, when I heard
</p>
<p>721)
</p>
<p>that solution given of this conversation; that Walker and Westenra
</p>
<p>(who were not produced, because it was not necessary to corroborate
</p>
<p>such a man as Captain Despard), bad actually concocted the scheme
</p>
<p>to get this fellow behind the ditch, and that the hoaxing conversation
</p>
<p>took place, in order that Captain Despard might have a good story to
</p>
<p>tell in a Court of Justice. But, Gentlemen of the Jury, how does it
</p>
<p>appear that when this plot took place any of these parties had any
</p>
<p>idea of a prosecution? Do you suppose that on the 15th of August
</p>
<p>last, Major Westenra, or Mr. Walker, the dramatis persona in this
</p>
<p>farce, had any idea there was to be a prosecution in the following
</p>
<p>December ? Do you suppose they foresaw that ? The resorting to
</p>
<p>any such statement shows that it was found impossible to get rid of
</p>
<p>this man's conversation. What said Mr. Macdonogh ? The man who
</p>
<p>spoke behind the ditch was one of the English assassins  one of the
</p>
<p>Chartists  one of the Bronterre O'Brien men, against whom Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell has always fulminated his denunciations. This, it is said,
</p>
<p>was a fellow sent to create bloodshed and dissension  an English as-
</p>
<p>sassin. Gentlemen of the Jury, you have no evidence whatever to
</p>
<p>that effect. It happens most unfortunately for these several hypo-
</p>
<p>theses, that the fact of the conversation is distinctly sworn to by Cap-
</p>
<p>tain Despard, and the probability of it confirmed by the Pilot news-
</p>
<p>paper of the 16th of August. " There were no Wexford men there at
</p>
<p>" all," says Mr. Hatched. "Do you suppose they would come such a
</p>
<p>" distance as fromShilmalier toTara  two thousand men from Wexford
</p>
<p>" toTara! I know Wexford right well : this could be nothing but ahoax.
</p>
<p>" There were no people at Tara from Wexford any more than I was
</p>
<p>" there." Upon turning, however, to the Pilot of the 16th of August,
</p>
<p>1843, describing this meeting, I find this: " We may again repeat
</p>
<p>" what we have stated in the beginning of this very imperfect account
</p>
<p>" of the scenes of yesterday, that Europe, perhaps the world, never
</p>
<p>" witnessed such a meeting before. With regard to the number of
</p>
<p>" persons present it would be impossible to form anything like a cor-
</p>
<p>" rect estimate ; but we took the trouble of requesting an old military
</p>
<p>" friend of our's, who rode over the hill on Monday, and viewed the

</p>
<p>" assembly yesterday from a commanding position, to give what he
</p>
<p>" thought a fair estimate, and he declared his opinion that there were
</p>
<p>" yesterday, on the plains of Tara, a million of persons. This may
</p>
<p>" seem impossible." Now observe. " This may seem impossible,
</p>
<p>" but when we state that, to our own knowledge, beside the great
</p>
<p>" bulk of the population of Dublio, and the counties of Leinster ad-
</p>
<p>joining Meath and Westmeath, there were a large number from
</p>
<p>" Connaught and Ulster, and some from 31unster," " Oh !" says
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatched, " it is impossible they should come from Wexford, it is
</p>
<p>too distant." Mr. Barrett gives you a distinct account to the contrary
</p>
<p>in his paper. But we go on a little : " The Croppies' grave in the
</p>
<p>" Rath-no-Rheagh, beside the house of Cormack, formed a peculiar
</p>
<p>" scene of attraction during the day, and some of the brave men of
</p>
<p>" Wexford, who had travelled upwards of sixty miles to be present,
</p>
<p>" said a prayer and dropped a tear over the dust of their brave and
</p>
<p>5A
</p>
<p>730
</p>
<p>" unfortunate relations, whose ashes rest beneath, and whose fate ti
</p>
<p>" was to know the soldier's risk without the soldier's hope." So much
</p>
<p>for the " humbug" of this Shilmalier man who was " hoaxing'' Cap-
</p>
<p>tain Despard. So much for the " English assassin" that came over
</p>
<p>from England for the purpose of deceiving Captain Despard, and giv-
</p>
<p>ing an illegal character to the meeting. So much for the concoction
</p>
<p>of the plot between Walker, the Head Constable, and Major Westenra,
</p>
<p>the officer, for the purpose of getting- up a scene, which Captain
</p>
<p>Despard might afterwards be able to prove in a Court of Justice. Here
</p>
<p>is an admission of the fact, and they glory in it, that persons had come
</p>
<p>from very many districts, and, amongst others, from the county of
</p>
<p>Wexford, sixty miles, to be present at that meeting. Have any of
</p>
<p>you a shadow of doubt that this conversation took place ? And what
</p>
<p>does it show ? It shows that this man, and those who were with him 
</p>
<p>two thousand from Wexford, and three thousand afterwards from
</p>
<p>Kildare  came there as men " of bone and sinew ;" that they were
</p>
<p>the sort of men that Mr. O'Connell wanted. The question is, what
</p>
<p>the people assembled at this meeting understood ? What they thought
</p>
<p>they were called on to do? And what they were to hold themselves
</p>
<p>in readiness to do, when called on?
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I now come to the speech, and some of the proceed-
</p>
<p>ings at this meeting. We have here what I may call a new act
</p>
<p>in the drama. Hitherto we have had meetings at different locali-
</p>
<p>ties in Ireland, not for any definite or 'particular reason assigned;
</p>
<p>but you will now find that the movers in this conspiracy, by way of
</p>
<p>maintaining the necessary degree of excitement in the Irish mind, and
</p>
<p>keeping the people in that state of preparation, which it was indis-
</p>
<p>pensable they should preserve until the proper time arrived, conceived
</p>
<p>the idea of having meetings at particular places in Ireland, where
</p>
<p>there had been battles, or victories, or massacres, or other events in
</p>
<p>Irish history, associated in the minds of the people with that feeling
</p>
<p>of ill-will and hostility, which it was sought to excite and perpetuate
</p>
<p>in their minds. The first of these meetings was this of Tara. Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell sufficiently indicates his intention in calling a meeting there

<p>by what I am now about to read to you. He says : " History may be
</p>
<p>" tarnished by exaggeration, but the fact is undoubted that we are at
</p>
<p>" Tara of the Kings. We are on the spot where the monarchs of
</p>
<p>" Ireland were elected, and where the chieftans of Ireland bound
</p>
<p>" themselves by the sacred pledge of honour and the tie of reli-
</p>
<p>" gion, to stand by their native land against the Danes or any other
</p>
<p>" stranger. This is emphatically the spot from which emanated  .
</p>
<p>" the social power  the legal authority  the right to dominion over
</p>
<p>" the furthest extremes of the island  and the power of concentrating
</p>
<p>" the force of the entire nation, for the purpose of national defence.
</p>
<p>" On this important spot I have an important duty to perform. I
</p>
<p>" here protest, in the face of my country, in the face of my Creator,
</p>
<p>" in the face of Ireland and our God, I protest against the continuance
</p>
<p>" of the unfounded and unjust Union. My proposition to Ireland is
</p>
<p>" that the Union is not binding upon us; it is not binding, I mean,
</p>
<p>731
</p>
<p>" upon conscience  it is void in principle, it is void as matter of
</p>
<p>" right, and it is void in constitutional law. I protest every tiling- that
</p>
<p>" is sacred, without being profane, to the truth of my assertion 
</p>
<p>*' there is really no Union between the two countries." There is
</p>
<p>then, Gentlemen, a very long passage, abusive of certain things and
</p>
<p>persons. Then follows : " Yes, the overwhelming majesty of your
</p>
<p>" multitude will be taken to England, and will have its effect there.
</p>
<p>" The Duke of Wellington began by threatening us. He talked of civil
</p>
<p>'-' war, but he does not say a single word about that now. He is now

<p>*.' getting eyelit holes made in the old barracks. And only think of
</p>
<p>" an old General doing such a thing  just as if we were going to
</p>
<p>" break our heads against stone walls. I am glad to find that a great
</p>
<p>" quantity of bread and biscuit has been lately imported, and I hope
</p>
<p>" the poor soldiers get some of them. But the Duke of Wellington
</p>
<p>" is now talking of attacking us, and I am glad of it. But 1 tell
</p>
<p>4< him this  I mean no disrespect to the brave, the gallant, and the
</p>
<p>" good conducted soldiers that compose the Queen's army  and all
</p>
<p>" of them that we have in this country are exceedingly well con-
</p>
<p>" ducted  there is not one of you that has a single complaint to make
</p>
<p>" against any of them ; they are the bravest army in the world, and
</p>
<p>" therefore I do not mean to disparage them at all ; but I feel it to
</p>
<p>" be a fact that Ireland, roused as she is at the present moment,
</p>
<p>" would, if they made war upon us, furnish women enough to beat
</p>
<p>" the entire of the Queen's forces. At the last fight for Ireland,
</p>
<p>" when she was betrayed by having confided in England's honour;
</p>
<p>" but, oh! English honour will never again betray our land, for the
</p>
<p>" man would deserve to be betrayed who would confide again in Eng-
</p>
<p>14 land. I would as soon confide in the cousin-german of a certain
</p>
<p>" personage having two horns and a hoof. At that last battle the
</p>
<p>" Irish soldiers, after three days' fighting, being attacked by fresh
</p>
<p>" troops, faltered and gave way, and one thousand five hundred of
</p>
<p>M the British army entered the breach. The Irish soldiers were faint-
</p>
<p>" ing and retiring, when the women of Limerick threw themselves
</p>
<p>" between the contending forces, and actually stayed the progress of

<p>" the advancing army." Then he goes on : " We will break no law."
</p>
<p>In all the speeches he says, " We will break no law." That is the ques-
</p>
<p>tion we are now trying, whether any law has been broken? Thatquestion
</p>
<p>we have brought to trial in the regular and constitutional way. That is
</p>
<p>the question you are empannelled to try, and no other. In this respect
</p>
<p>I again desire not to be misunderstood : " See how we have accumu-
</p>
<p>" lated the people of Ireland for this Repeal year. When on the 2nd
</p>
<p>" of January I ventured to call it the Repeal year, every person
</p>
<p>" laughed at me. Are they laughing now? It is our turn to laugh
</p>
<p>" at present. Before twelve months more the Parliament will be in
</p>
<p>" College-green. I said the Union did not take away from the people
</p>
<p>" of Ireland their legal rights. I told you that the Union did not de-
</p>
<p>" prive the people of that right, or take away the authority to have
</p>
<p>" self-legislation." Is this, or is it not, questioning the legal vali-
</p>
<p>dity of the Act of Union ? "I told you that the Union did not de-
</p>
<p>732
</p>
<p>" prive the people of that right, or take away the authority to have
</p>
<p>" self- legislation." He then goes on to abuse the Lord Chancellor,
</p>
<p>and then he says : " We have a list of the towns to return Members."
</p>
<p>Here, Gentlemen, you observe, a new scene opens. " We have a
</p>
<p>" list of the towns to return members (the counties, as a matter of
</p>
<p>" course, will return them), according to their population, and the
</p>
<p>" Queen has only to order writs to issue, and to have honest Ministers
</p>
<p>" to advise her to issue those writs, and the Irish Parliament is re-
</p>
<p>" vived by its own energy, and the force of the Sovereign's preroga-
</p>
<p>" tive. I will only require the Queen to exercise her prerogative,
</p>
<p>" and the Irish people will obtain their nationality again." This is
</p>
<p>the compact or bargain into which Mr. O'Connell is desiring to enter
</p>
<p>with his followers, if they will stand by him. He says he will only
</p>
<p>require the Queen to issue writs. " If, at the present moment, the
</p>
<p>" Irish Parliament was in existence, even as it was in 1800, is there
</p>
<p>" a coward amongst you  is there a wretch amongst you so despica-
</p>
<p>" ble, that would not die rather than allow the Union to pass ? Let
</p>
<p>" every man who, if we had an Irish Parliament, would rather die
</p>
<p>" than allow the Union to pass, lift up his hands." The immense
</p>
<p>multitude lifted up their hands. " Yes, the Queen will call that par-
</p>
<p>" liament. You may say it is the act of the Ministry, if you please.
</p>
<p>" To be sure, it would be the act of her Ministry, and the people of
</p>
<p>" Ireland are entitled to have their friends appointed to the Ministry.
</p>
<p>" The Irish parliament will then assemble ; and I defy all the gene-
</p>
<p>" rals, old and young, and all the old women in pantaloons  nay, I
</p>
<p>" defy all the chivalry of the earth to take away that Parliament from
</p>
<p>" us again. Give me three millions of Repealers  and I will soon
</p>
<p>" have them. The next step is being taken, and I announce to you
</p>
<p>" from this spot, that all the magistrates that have been deprived
</p>
<p>" of the commission of the peace shall be appointed by the As-
</p>
<p>" sociation to settle all the disputes and differences in their neighbour-
</p>
<p>" hood. Keep out of the Petty Sessions' Courts, and go not to
</p>
<p>" them. On next Monday we will submit a plan to choose persons to
</p>
<p>" be Arbitrators; to settle the differences of the people without ex-

</p>
<p>" pense ; and I call on every man who wishes to be thought the friend
</p>
<p>" of Ireland, to have his disputes settled by the Arbitrators ; and not
</p>
<p>" again to go to the Petty Sessions. We shall shortly have the
</p>
<p>" Preservative Society [this is a new thing] to arrange the means."
</p>
<p>Of what? " Of procuring from Her Majesty the exercise of
</p>
<p>" her prerogative; and I believe I am able to announce to you,
</p>
<p>" that twelve months cannot possibly elapse without having an hurra
</p>
<p>" for our Parliament in College-green." Here it is avowed that
</p>
<p>the Association are to appoint the dismissed magistrates to be
</p>
<p>Arbitrators to settle all differences. This, it is said, is purely
</p>
<p>out of regard to the precepts of the Gospel, and in accordance
</p>
<p>with the admonitions of St. Paul ; a mere imitation of the Society
</p>
<p>of our respectable fellow-subjects called Quakers. That is the sole
</p>
<p>reason, as the counsel would have you believe, why these Arbi-
</p>
<p>733
</p>
<p>trntion Courts were instituted. It was, with a view, forsooth, to
</p>
<p>prevent the profligate taking of oaths, and the outrage of morality
</p>
<p>thereby so frequently committed in the ordinary tribunals of justice !
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell proceeds: " Remember I pronounce the Union 10 be
</p>
<p>" null, to be obeyed as an injustice must be obeyed where it is sup-
</p>
<p>" ported by law, until we have the royal authority to set the matter
</p>
<p>" right, and substitute our own Parliament."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, there was, upon this occasion, also a dinner  a banquet
</p>
<p>it is called in the paper,  at which some of the traversers attended, and
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell again made a speech, from which I shall read some ex-
</p>
<p>tracts : ' It may be imagined that they are not brave, because they are
</p>
<p>" submissive. But he is no statesman who does not recollect the might
</p>
<p>" that slumbers in a peasant's arm." Now lean understand a Minis-
</p>
<p>ter, or a Government, being swayed by the peaceful expression of the
</p>
<p>popular will, to carry, or to repeal, any measure that may be considered,
</p>
<p>on the one hand, desirable, or on the other, improper; but I cannot
</p>
<p>understand this language : " that he is no statesman who does not re-
</p>
<p>collect the might that slumbers in a peasant's arm"  I cannot un-
</p>
<p>derstand that in any other sense than this, that no statesman who sees
</p>
<p>the number of persons assembled at these meetings, and considers
</p>
<p>what the effect of their " bone and sinew" would be  (hat no states-
</p>
<p>man who reflects on that, would dare to refuse anything those people
</p>
<p>demanded. " And when you multiply that might by vulgar arith-
</p>
<p>" metic to the extent of 600,000 or 700,000, is the man a states-
</p>
<p>" man or a driveller who expects that might will always slumber
</p>
<p>" amidst grievances continued and oppression endured too long,
</p>
<p>" and the determination to allow them to cure themselves, and not
</p>
<p>" take active measures to prevent the outbreak which sooner or later
</p>
<p>" will be the consequence of the present afflicted state of Ireland ? I
</p>
<p>" say sooner or later, because I venture to assert while I live myself
</p>
<p>" that outbreak will not take place." Gentlemen, that sentence is
</p>
<p>pregnant with meaning : " whilst I live ;" I, who have evoked this
</p>
<p>spirit, may, whilst I live, allay it; but after my death there may not
</p>
<p>be a person who has the control over the masses that I have been

</p>
<p>able to exercise ; and, therefore, as long as I live myself, there
</p>
<p>may be no such outbreak. But he does not venture, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>to assure us of security longer than he himself shall live ; on the
</p>
<p>contrary, he goes on thus : " But sooner or later, if they do not
</p>
<p>" correct the evil, and restore to Ireland her power of self-goverYi-
</p>
<p>" ment, the day will come when they will rue their present want of
</p>
<p>" policy, and will weep, perhaps in tears of blood, for their want of
</p>
<p>" consideration and kindness to a country, whose people could reward
</p>
<p>" them amply by the devotion of their hearts and the vigour of their
</p>
<p>" arms." Then he says : " Why don't the landlords join, and the
</p>
<p>" gentry ; if they do not join very speedily, it will be the worse for
</p>
<p>" them, for we are in a hurry to pass Repeal." Then he says :
</p>
<p>" From this I turn to the splendid spectacle of to-day. Thousands
</p>
<p>" upon thousands were around us, but where are they now ? They
</p>
<p>734
</p>
<p>" are dissolved like the snow before the returning south wind and the
</p>
<p>" genial sun. They are gone home in peace  in quiet and in tran-
</p>
<p>" quillity. But if I were to call them together again, to-morrow, and
</p>
<p>" to tell them that the Saxons were at their doors  that the scenes
</p>
<p>" that had so often been repeated, from the day when the vile Crom-
</p>
<p>" well deliberately massacred three hundred women grouped around
</p>
<p>" the Cross of the Redeemer, in the town of Wexford  from that day,
</p>
<p>" when the barbarian Saxon delighted his assassin soldiers by the
</p>
<p>" slow process of individual murder, until the three hundred females
</p>
<p>*' were, one after the other, stabbed and massacred ; even Tara-hill is
</p>
<p>" stained with modern blood, and the bones are not mouldered yet
</p>
<p>" of the individuals who were massacred in hundreds upon it ; if such
</p>
<p>" another force were brought from England now, if it was announced
</p>
<p>" to the people that some paltry Orangemen were armed, and that
</p>
<p>" foreign soldiers were brought over to butcher, to slaughter, and to
</p>
<p>" dishonour, oh ! tell the people that, and see whether they have
</p>
<p>" melted away like the snow." Gentlemen, Dr. Gray appears to
</p>
<p>have made a speech at this meeting, which, in my judgment, is suffi-
</p>
<p>ciently demonstrative of his conception as to the state of things, and
</p>
<p>what was in contemplation. He was called upon to return thanks to
</p>
<p>the toast of " the Press;" and he said : " In one thing only am I
</p>
<p>" compelled to differ from the observation that has fallen from our
</p>
<p>" respected chairman. In giving the toast, he stated that the Press
</p>
<p>" was of no politics; and 1 ivish to correct the error by declaring
</p>
<p>" on behalf of the national Press of Ireland, that the members of it
</p>
<p>" were politicians in the strongest sense of the word. I had myself
</p>
<p>" the honour of being among them that evening as a guest, but I feel
</p>
<p>" that wherever I am I am an Irishman, and as an Irishman, I am
</p>
<p>" ready to strike out boldly for the political liberty of my country.
</p>
<p>" The Repeal Press was a political Press, but its politics were the
</p>
<p>" politics of Ireland ; and, steadily adhering to the course it had
</p>
<p>" adopted, it would never deviate to the right hand or to the left, till
</p>
<p>< the people of that country were relieved from Saxon tyranny and
</p>
<p>" olio-archie dominion. I believe I would best evince the high sense

<p>" I entertain of the compliment paid the ' press-gang,' by being brief,
</p>
<p>" and allowing them to gang home, that they might send their broad
</p>
<p> sheets through the length and breadth of the land, and not of that
</p>
<p>" land only, but to the alien isle hard by, that so jealously watched
</p>
<p>" the proceedings of that clay. Every eye was fixed upon the council
</p>
<p>" that day at Tara, and eagerly looked to its resolves. Was it not a
</p>
<p>"national council, in the most extended meaning of the phrase ?
</p>
<p>" Had they not at their head the monarch of the Irish heart ? Had
</p>
<p> they not the spiritual peers of the realm ? Did not the lay peers
</p>
<p>" aid by their counsel ? They had there, too, the clergy of the land,
</p>
<p>" and the constitutional representatives of the people. Aye, and the
</p>
<p>" people themselves, in their multitudinous thousands, had that day
</p>
<p> assembled, and within the precincts of the ancient Council Hall of
</p>
<p>" Tara, taken counsel together, and issued their proclamation, and
</p>
<p>" that proclamation was  No compromise. As I this day strayed
</p>
<p>" over the ruins of our passed glory, I chanced to walk over the
</p>
<p>735
</p>
<p>c< graves of the patriots of what I might call their <iwn day." Now
</p>
<p>there is no inuendo here, I admit ; but I think it is not necessary to
</p>
<p>have an inuendo as to " the patriots of their own day" at Tara.
</p>
<p>" I could not find words to give expression to the emotions I felt, as
</p>
<p>" I contemplated their sad fate. A sorrowful chill came upon me
</p>
<p>" when I looked upon their resting-place, and saw in their end the
</p>
<p>" dark history of the past. But that chill passed away, and hope re-
</p>
<p>" vived, when I saw that upon their graves the Stone of Destiny stood
</p>
<p>" erect. For centuries had that mysterious relic been prostrate, as
</p>
<p>" the land whose destiny its fall symbolised ; but now that I see it
</p>
<p>" erect again, and on Tara's hill, and over the patriots' grave, I feel
</p>
<p>" that the blood of the last martyr had been shed, and that Ireland
</p>
<p>" herself would soon assume the upright position, and exhibit the
</p>
<p>" dignity of a nation."
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice Hand me up that paper.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General.  Gentlemen, there were certain meet-
</p>
<p>ings of the Association on the 18th and the 25th of July, which were
</p>
<p>adverted to, merely for the purpose of showing the payment of money
</p>
<p>and proving the presence of Mr. Ray, Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Duffy,
</p>
<p>and Mr. John O'Connell. I do not mean to trouble you with those.
</p>
<p>For the purpose of saving time, and my own strength, I mean to con-
</p>
<p>fine myself merely to those matters of evidence, upon which it is ne-
</p>
<p>cessary 1 should comment.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I now come to certain transactions, which took place
</p>
<p>at the meeting of the Association, I think upon the 22nd of August.
</p>
<p>Mr. Jackson proved that he attended at that meeting, and that seve-
</p>
<p>ral documents or copies were handed to him by the Secretary or offi-
</p>
<p>cer of the Association. Amongst these was a paper entitled " Plan
</p>
<p>for the renewed Action of the Irish Parliament." Mr. O'Connell, at
</p>
<p>the meeting-, when this was brought forward, introduced it by some
</p>
<p>observations, which I shall read to you : " He [Mr. O'Connell]
</p>
<p>" felt it his solemn duty to protest there in the face of high Heaven,
</p>
<p>" and that congregated multitude, that the Union was void in princi-
</p>
<p>" pie, and in constitutional law there was no Union; that their rights

</p>
<p>" were unimpeached ; that the Queen's prerogative was untouched ;
</p>
<p>" that her privileges were unfettered; that the rights of the Irish
</p>
<p>" people were broken in upon and destroyed by a parchment union,
</p>
<p>" put into the shape of an Act of Parliament." " It was an Act of Par-
</p>
<p>liament without force or validity." This is most unequivocal language ;
</p>
<p>it is impossible to qualify this language by the ingenious construction
</p>
<p>or supposition of counsel. " It was an Act of Parliament without
</p>
<p>" force or validity, which was submitted to." Why? " Because, in
</p>
<p>" the words of Saurin, it could be enforced by the Judges and the
</p>
<p>" bayonet, and they were not men of blood and strife. But while
</p>
<p>" they submitted to it de facto, it was wrong de jure. They would
</p>
<p>" submit to it as long as England was strong; but resistance to the
</p>
<p>" Union, said Saurin, will, in the abstract, be a duty; and the exhi-
</p>
<p>" bition of that resistance be a simple question of prudence. He
</p>
<p>73G
</p>
<p>" [Mr. O'ConneJl] thought it was now prudent to resist the Union.
</p>
<p>'.* He was of that opinion at present, and lie would get seven millions
</p>
<p>(< more to help him to resist it. In that assemblage be made that
</p>
<p>" proclamation ; but he did not mean to rest there ; and he pledged
</p>
<p>* himself to bring about legally, peaceably, and constitutionally, the
</p>
<p>" Repeal of that Union. He rose now to place before the meeting
</p>
<p>" his plan or mode for the restoration of the Irish Parliament."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I must call your particular attention to
</p>
<p>this constitution, with which this Irish Solon has favoured us. This
</p>
<p>is his plan for the renewed action of the Irish Parliament: " Plan for
</p>
<p>" the renewed action of the Irish Parliament. Firstly.  The Irish
</p>
<p>" people recognize, acknowledge, maintain, and will continually pre-
</p>
<p>" serve and uphold upon the throne of Ireland, Her Majesty~Queen
</p>
<p>" Victoria, whom God protect ! Queen, by undoubted right, and by
</p>
<p>" hereditary descent, of Ireland, and her heirs and successors for
</p>
<p>" ever." Gentlemen, so far that is right. " The people of Ireland
</p>
<p>" recognize, acknowledge, maintain, and will continually preserve
</p>
<p>" and uphold, all the prerogatives of Her Majesty, and her heirs and
</p>
<p>" successors, belonging to, and inherent in, the imperial crown of
</p>
<p>" Ireland."
</p>
<p>Here, Gentlemen, this document professes to be a declaration,
</p>
<p>and national manifesto of the people of Ireland, expressing their
</p>
<p>opinion, and their readiness to have a Constitution formed for this
</p>
<p>country, on certain terms, and that the materials of that Constitution,
</p>
<p>and the several ranks and orders in it, shall be according to the plan
</p>
<p>which is here proposed for the adoption of the Association. " And
</p>
<p>" they will true allegiance bear, pure, undivided, and indivisible, to
</p>
<p>" Her Majesty, her heirs and successors for ever. Secondly The
</p>
<p>" People of Ireland"  the people of Ireland !  " acknowledge, and
</p>
<p>" will maintain, and preserve for ever, the privileges, hereditary
</p>
<p>" and personal, of the Peers of Ireland, together with the legislative
</p>
<p>" and judicial authority of the Irish House of Lords, and the exer-
</p>
<p>" cise of the prerogative in augmenting and limiting the peerage, as
</p>
<p>" the same did of right exist before the year 1800." The people of

</p>
<p>Ireland will acknowledge and maintain that. Suppose^the people of
</p>
<p>Ireland thought the contrary, would they not have equally the power
</p>
<p>to assert it ? " Thirdly  The people of Ireland do firmly insist up-
</p>
<p>" on the restoration of the Irish House, consisting of three hundred
</p>
<p>" representatives of the Irish people ; and claim, in the presence of
</p>
<p>" their Creator, the right of the people of Ireland to such restora-
</p>
<p>" tion." Observe, this is not a Repeal of the Legislative Union, not
</p>
<p>a petition to Parliament to repeal the Union, but it is a demand from
</p>
<p>the Irish people, insisting on the restoration of the Irish House of
</p>
<p>Commons, and three hundred representatives. " They have sub-
</p>
<p>" mitted to the Union, as being binding as a law ; but they declare
</p>
<p>"solemnly that it is not founded on right, or on constitutional prin-
</p>
<p>" ciple, and that it is not obligatory upon conscience. They agree
</p>
<p>" with the Tory Attorney-General, Saurin, that the only binding
</p>
<p>737
</p>
<p>" power of the Union is the strength of the English domination.**
</p>
<p>That is Article three in the renewed plan  " the only binding power,"
</p>
<p>il They also agree with him that ' resistance to the Union is in the
</p>
<p>" ' abstract a duty, and the exhibition of that resistance a mere ques-
</p>
<p>" ' tion of prudence.' They will therefore resist the Union by all
</p>
<p>" legal, peaceful, and constitutional means." I do not know, Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, what is meant by " resisting the Union." It is an ex-
</p>
<p>pression which I do not profess to understand. No explanation
</p>
<p>has been given of it on this trial. " By all legal and constitutional
</p>
<p>means." These means have not been stated to us. " Resisting the
</p>
<p>Union by legal, peaceable, and constitutional means," I confess my-
</p>
<p>self unable to comprehend. " Fourthly  The plan for the restora-
</p>
<p>" tion of the Irish Parliament is as follows.'' What is meant by
</p>
<p>"restoration?" What do you, Mr. O'Connell, and the other gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen assisting you in getting up this Constitution, mean by the
</p>
<p>" restoration of the Irish Parliament ?" You shall hear. [The
</p>
<p>Solicitor-General here read the number of Members to be re-
</p>
<p>turned, as set out in the article.] Such is to be the constitution of
</p>
<p>what is denominated the " restored" parliament, according to the
</p>
<p>plan of the traversers, or those who were concerned in the concoction
</p>
<p>of this document. Gentlemen of the Jury, they have not favoured us
</p>
<p>with any intimation of what measures would be introduced into such
</p>
<p>a Parliament, except one or two. The first is, as you will hear pre-
</p>
<p>sently, the total abolition of the Church Establishment, the severance
</p>
<p>of the connexion between Church and State ; the next, fixity of tenure,
</p>
<p>that is, the depriving landlords of the right of recovering rent unless
</p>
<p>they give leases for certain periods. There is another which you shall
</p>
<p>hear by-and-by. These are the only measures which at present they
</p>
<p>have noticed as likely to be introduced into the new Parliament. But,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, when we hear this Constitution read, and
</p>
<p>when we find the connexion between the two countries is to be con-
</p>
<p>tinued, that no separation is to be contemplated, as a consequence of
</p>
<p>the Repeal of the Union, allow me to ask what security there would
</p>
<p>be in such a Constitution, or in a Parliament thus appointed,

</p>
<p>against anything that the persons influential in returning those mem-
</p>
<p>bers to Parliament might think fit to introduce ?
</p>
<p>Well, Gentlemen, then follows a schedule, in which the popula-
</p>
<p>tion returns are referred to, and a great number of towns are inserted
</p>
<p>in alphabetical order, with their respective number of inhabitants,
</p>
<p>and the number of members they are to return ; and in this way the
</p>
<p>total members for cities and towns amount to one hundred and twenty-
</p>
<p>seven, and for counties one hundred and seventy-three, making three
</p>
<p>hundred. So far as the fixing the number of Members of the House
</p>
<p>of Commons, we have satisfactory information.
</p>
<p>Then, Gentlemen, comes another item ; and that is the constitution
</p>
<p>of the House, and how these three hundred persons are to be returned.
</p>
<p>To meet that part of the matter: " It is proposed that the right of
</p>
<p>" voting should be what is called household suffrage, requiring six
</p>
<p>" months' residence in the counties, with the addition in the towns of
</p>
<p>5B
</p>
<p>738
</p>
<p>" married men resident for twelve months, whether householders or
</p>
<p>w not. It is proposed that the mode of voting for members of Par-
</p>
<p>" liament should certainly be by ballot." What do you suppose,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, would be the legislation of an assembly, composed of three
</p>
<p>hundred members, returned in this manner? Provision is next made
</p>
<p>for an exigency which might arise, and which in fact had been found
</p>
<p>to lead to considerable embarrassment and difficulty  I mean the pos-
</p>
<p>sibility of a Regency. It might happen that the Irish Parliament
</p>
<p>should choose to have one person Regent, in case of the temporary
</p>
<p>disqualification or disability of the Sovereign, and the British Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment might choose to have another. Such a case is provided for :
</p>
<p>" Eighthly.  The Monarch de facto of England at all times hereafter,
</p>
<p>" whoever he may be, shall be Monarch de jure in Ireland; and so,
</p>
<p>" in case of a future regency, the Regent de facto in England to be
</p>
<p>" Regent de jure in Ireland." But suppose such a rule made, or
</p>
<p>such a preliminary law established, what would fetter the new Par-
</p>
<p>liament, or prevent it, if the case should actually arise, from alter-
</p>
<p>ing that provision, and enacting that the person who was Regent de
</p>
<p>facto in England should not be Regent de jure in Ireland? Such
</p>
<p>is the security that this plan would afford against the mischiefs which
</p>
<p>must necessarily, or at all events, would probably ensue from sepa-
</p>
<p>rate Legislatures : " Ninthly  The connexion between Great Britain
</p>
<p>" and Ireland, by means of the power, authority, and prerogatives of
</p>
<p>" the Crown, to be perpetual and incapable of change, or any seve-
</p>
<p>" ranee or separation." Really, Gentlemen, what absurdity is this !
</p>
<p>as if the frame rs of this or that Constitution could impose shackles
</p>
<p>upon the power that they themselves had created  the legislative
</p>
<p>power  and make it a species of condition that must be ever after
</p>
<p>complied with, that any connexion between the two countries should
</p>
<p>subsist and be incapable of change. " The foregoing plan to be car-
</p>
<p>" ried into effect according to recognized law and strict constitutional
</p>
<p>" principle." Now you would expect  it would be very desirable 
</p>
<p>that they should proceed to show how that was to be done. But
</p>
<p>what comes next? "Signed by order  Daniel O'Connell!" There

</p>
<p>is the end of this scheme. All this is to be done according to u order
</p>
<p>and constitutional principle," but there Mr. O'Connell stops.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, you will see, in the sequel, what steps
</p>
<p>were afterwards taken for the purpose of further prosecuting this
</p>
<p>plan for the restoration of a separate Legislature for Ireland. I
</p>
<p>shall for the present, proceed, as I proposed to myself, in chrono-
</p>
<p>logical order.
</p>
<p>Accompanying the document to which I have just adverted,
</p>
<p>another was circulated on the 22nd of August, 1843, which I hold
</p>
<p>in my hand, and which was copied from that which I read. It is 
</p>
<p>" Plan for the renewed Action of the Irish Parliament : Repeal As-
</p>
<p>" sociation, 22nd of August, 1843." This document was printed by
</p>
<p>Browne, by order of the Association; and a great number of copies
</p>
<p>struck off', and circulated, by the order of the Association.
</p>
<p>739
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I propose next to refer to the proceedings of the
</p>
<p>Association upon the 23rd of August, the day next following that
</p>
<p>upon which this plan for the renewed action of the Irish Parliament
</p>
<p>was submitted to the consideration of the meeting, And this will
</p>
<p>introduce the subject of the Arbitration Courts, the plan for which
</p>
<p>you will find was at this meeting brought forward and adopted. The
</p>
<p>person most active, as appears by the documents, in the preparation
</p>
<p>of this plan, was the traverser Dr. Gray. You will remember that
</p>
<p>the subject had been announced previously by Mr. O'Connell. At
</p>
<p>this meeting of the 23rd of August, a report was presented by Dr.
</p>
<p>Gray, from a committee to whom this subject of arbitration had been
</p>
<p>referred. I must beg leave to request your attention to the intro-
</p>
<p>duction of this report, as bearing upon the motives which actuated the
</p>
<p>traversers in the institution of these Courts. I admit, in the fullest
</p>
<p>degree, the perfect legality of any persons in the community referring
</p>
<p>their disputes to arbitration. If I, or any one of you, have a matter of
</p>
<p>difference with another, the law not only does not prohibit, but, to a
</p>
<p>certain degree, it recommends and assists the reference of that matter
</p>
<p>in controversy to the judgment of private persons; and it is also, in
</p>
<p>the abstract, a duty enjoined by our religion, to avoid going to law.
</p>
<p>The respectable body of the Quakers make this a rule of their Society.
</p>
<p>It is, therefore, Gentlemen, quite unnecessary to assert the legality
</p>
<p>of arbitration. It is not, and never has been, denied. If this were
</p>
<p>a mere case of a reference to a private individual, for the purpose of
</p>
<p>arbitration, we should not have thought of interfering with the
</p>
<p>parties adopting that course; but I think, when I come to call
</p>
<p>your attention to the document I hold in my hand, you will
</p>
<p>say that we are not dealing with a reference by private indivi-
</p>
<p>duals of their controversies, to Arbitrators selected by themselves,
</p>
<p>but that the plan here suggested is a usurpation of the prerogative
</p>
<p>of the Crown by the National Association of Ireland  the Repeal
</p>
<p>Association  by instituting and appointing for the adjudication of
</p>
<p>rights, tribunals in the several districts in Ireland, to supersede and
</p>
<p>to do away with the ordinary legal tribunals, and to bring them into

</p>
<p>disrepute and disfavour. Now observe whether it is possible to
</p>
<p>arrive at any other conclusion, as to the real nature of these Courts,
</p>
<p>and the motives of the parties who suggested the institution of them?
</p>
<p>It appears, that at a particular period of last year, the Lord Chan-
</p>
<p>cellor thought it his duty to remove from the commission of the
</p>
<p>peace, certain persons who had attended Repeal meetings or demon-
</p>
<p>strations. As soon as it was ascertained that the gentlemen who
</p>
<p>had attended those meetings, had ceased to exercise magisterial
</p>
<p>functions, the plan of substituting for the ordinary tribunals, others
</p>
<p>to be filled by the very persons dismissed, occurred to the persons
</p>
<p>connected with this conspiracy. Accordingly you will find, that very
</p>
<p>shortly after that step was taken by the Lord Chancellor, a plan was
</p>
<p>concocted of reinstating, as it were, the dismissed magistrates in the
</p>
<p>functions of judges, and of coercing (for it really falls very little short
</p>
<p>of it) the persons under the control of this Association to abide by
</p>
<p>740
</p>
<p>the decisions of those persons, instead of going before the magistrates
</p>
<p>who had been left in the commission, or before the other tribunals
</p>
<p>established by the law. Bearing in mind this object, and the view
</p>
<p>which I attribute to them, you will be pleased to observe the first
</p>
<p>sentence in this report. " Your Committee are strongly of opinion,
</p>
<p>" that inasmuch as many of the magistrates, who possessed popular
</p>
<p>iS confidence, have been deprived of the commission of the peace,
</p>
<p>" because of their attachment to the cause of legislative indepen-
</p>
<p>" dence, no unnecessary time should be lost in carrying into practice
</p>
<p>" the principle of Arbitration, as already approved of by the unani-
</p>
<p>" mous vote of the Association. In order, therefore, to secure the
</p>
<p>" perfect and harmonious working of such a system, your Committee
</p>
<p>" recommend that a standing Committee be immediately formed to
</p>
<p>i( arrange the necessary details, prepare the requisite forms, and su-
</p>
<p>" perintend the practical working of the system after it shall have
</p>
<p>" been put in operation." That is the judicial system. Now to
</p>
<p>compare this with the reference in any individual case of a matter
</p>
<p>of law, or of fact, to the arbitration of the Ouzel Galley, or of two
</p>
<p>gentlemen selected by the parties, is absolutely ridiculous. Here
</p>
<p>it is announced, that the reason of appointing arbitrators is the dis-
</p>
<p>missal of the magistrates. It is further announced, that there is to
</p>
<p>be a system, the practical working of which is to be pointed out by
</p>
<p>the Committee, to whom the matter had been referred. And ob-
</p>
<p>serve now how this system is to be carried on :  " Being further of
</p>
<p>" opinion that the system of Arbitration should be as universally
</p>
<p>" applied as the circumstances of each locality will admit, your Com-
</p>
<p>" mittee recommend that for that purpose, the several counties be
</p>
<p>" apportioned into districts, and that three or more Arbitrators
</p>
<p>" be recommended for each district, the number to be determined
</p>
<p>" by the extent, population, and such other local circumstances as
</p>
<p>" may seem to bear directly thereon. In defining those dis-
</p>
<p>" tricts, your Committee would suggest that advantage be taken
</p>
<p>" of the divisions at present established for the purpose of Petty
</p>
<p>" Sessions' Courts." What is the meaning of that ? The districts

</p>
<p>already established for the Petty Sessions' Courts shall be the dis-
</p>
<p>tricts for our Courts, to supersede the Petty Sessions' Courts and the
</p>
<p>magistrates, the ordinary tribunals. This we recommend. And ob-
</p>
<p>serve, the Arbitrators, that is the Judges of the new judicial system,
</p>
<p>are to be persons appointed, not by the parties, but by this Associa-
</p>
<p>tion. When any individual case comes to be adjudicated on, a form
</p>
<p>is to be gone through for the purpose of keeping within the law, but
</p>
<p>the whole thing is obviously irreconcileable with the law  a system of
</p>
<p>appointing persons among whom parties litigant are to choose Arbitra-
</p>
<p>tors, without being left to the exercise of their own free will. They
</p>
<p>then recommend : " That the dismissed magistrates, and such Repeal
</p>
<p>u justices as have resigned, be, in the first instance, recommended as
</p>
<p>** Arbitrators in their respective districts ; and that a dismissed magis-
</p>
<p>" trate, or one who has resigned at present, be in all cases chosen as
</p>
<p>*' the Chairman of the Court of Arbitration." This is flying in the
</p>
<p>741
</p>
<p>face of what had been done; saying, in so many terms, these magis-
</p>
<p>trates who had been dismissed  rightly or wrongly, that is not the
</p>
<p>question now, but dismissed by the proper authority  are to be
</p>
<p>Judges in our new judicial system. " Your Committee are strongly
</p>
<p>" impressed with the conviction, that in selecting persons to be en-
</p>
<p>11 trusted with such high and important functions"  selecting  why ?
</p>
<p>" as those that will necessarily devolve upon the Arbitrators, the ut-
</p>
<p>" most diligence should be used to procure persons, not only of high
</p>
<p>" moral character and local influence, but who also possess the full
</p>
<p>11 and complete confidence of the several classes upon whose cases
</p>
<p>" they may have to arbitrate." To procure persons  by whom ? By
</p>
<p>the Association, or the agents of the Association, before there is any
</p>
<p>difference at all. I can understand a recommendation, that if A. B.
</p>
<p>or C. D. have a matter of controversy between them, they shall refer
</p>
<p>that to the arbitration of a private individual ; but I do not understand
</p>
<p>the appointing, a priori, a set of Arbitrators, or Judges, for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of determining all differences or disputes, which may hereafter
</p>
<p>arise between the inhabitants of a particular district. " For this pur-
</p>
<p>" pose they would suggest, that the Repeal Wardens resident in the
</p>
<p>*' several districts be called upon to recommend to the Association"
</p>
<p> not to the parties who are litigants, but to the Association  " such
</p>
<p>" persons as may seem to them the best qualified to act as Arbitrators,
</p>
<p>" and that they be directed, in making their selection, to request the
</p>
<p>" aid of the Repeal clergy and gentry in their several districts. That
</p>
<p>u the names of the persons so selected and approved of be transmitted
</p>
<p>" to the Association, through the Provincial Inspector of Wardens,
</p>
<p>" and be accompanied by a report from him on the qualifications of
</p>
<p>" the persons so recommended, and that such recommendations and
</p>
<p>" reports be referred for consideration to the standing Commit-
</p>
<p>" tee. In giving the sanction of your Association to the recom-
</p>
<p>" mendation of any Arbitrator, your Committee suggest that it be
</p>
<p>" given by vote of the Association, at one of the ordinary or
</p>
<p>" adjourned public meetings, on special motion made, and that
</p>
<p>" of such motion it is necessary that at least one week's public

</p>
<p>" notice be given." They then recommend the mode of proceeding
</p>
<p>for Arbitrators, by keeping books, and so on ; and then they recom-
</p>
<p>mend, " that any person having any difference with, or claim upon,
</p>
<p>" another, shall serve notice upon that other, calling upon him to come
</p>
<p>" before the Arbitrators upon the next day of sitting, and submit to
</p>
<p>** have the matter in dispute arbitrated upon." Now what is this?
</p>
<p>They recommend that any person who has a matter of controversy,
</p>
<p>shall serve a notice on his adversary, citing him before this new tri-
</p>
<p>bunal of arbitration, for the purpose of adjudicating on the matter in
</p>
<p>controversy between them. They then make further suggestions
</p>
<p>with which I need not trouble you ; and they add : " Which award
</p>
<p>" shall be final and conclusive ; and that they endorse same upon the
</p>
<p>" deed of submission, and see that the proper entry of the proceed-
</p>
<p>" ings be made in the minute book by the Secretary, and that a copy
</p>
<p>" of the award be given to each party, and that the original deed of
</p>
<p>" submission and award be preserved." That is to say, the records
</p>
<p>742
</p>
<p>of these tribunals are to be kept amongst the archives of the Associ-
</p>
<p>ation- Their decisions, and the proceedings before them, are to be
</p>
<p>registered and recorded at the Association. Well might Mr. Duffy
</p>
<p>say, in the paper which I read to you a while ago, that these parties
</p>
<p>were fast becoming a nation ; that "the administration of justice" was
</p>
<p>already in their hands. " Your Committee also recommend that
</p>
<p>" after the publication of the award, should either party refuse to
</p>
<p>" comply therewith, the party so refusing shall be reported by the
</p>
<p>" Arbitrators to the Association, and that the standing Committee do
</p>
<p>" then proceed to inquire into the cause of said refusal ; and that
</p>
<p>" should the party so refusing fail to give satisfactory reasons to the
</p>
<p>" Committee for such his refusal, the Committee do recommend that
</p>
<p>" the party so refusing be expelled from the Association by a public
</p>
<p>" vote." When this was stated in the course of the trial, it was al-
</p>
<p>leged that that part of the Report had not been acceded to or adopt-
</p>
<p>ed. I shall show you, in a few minutes, that it was, and by a docu-
</p>
<p>ment which we have proved.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I shall not trouble you further on this Report at pre-
</p>
<p>sent ; but you will see, from the tenor of it, that it is totally different
</p>
<p>from what it has been assimilated to by the counsel, namely, the re-
</p>
<p>ference by private individuals of particular matters of controversy
</p>
<p>between them to the arbitration of third persons. And as connected
</p>
<p>with that document, I may just refer you to two others, which have
</p>
<p>been proved, and which were received by the Association, namely,
</p>
<p>what is called the summons  but which I call the process  to be issued
</p>
<p>for the adjudication of these differences. The other is the appoint-
</p>
<p>ment of the Arbitrator. You will recollect, Gentlemen, that the
</p>
<p>view they would have you to take of these proceedings is this, that the
</p>
<p>Association merely recommended, that, instead of going to law, the
</p>
<p>parties should refer their differences to private arbitration. But,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, when people refer their differences to arbitration in the
</p>
<p>ordinary way they choose their own judges. But what is this docu-
</p>
<p>ment ? " These presents are to testify, that the Loyal National
</p>

<p>" names. " Chairman.
</p>

</p>
<p>This is the judicial commission issued to the Arbitrators. Well,
</p>
<p>now, what is the summons? " Mullagh Arbitration Court." There
</p>
<p>is the figure of the Crown, and the Shamrock, I suppose it is, under-
</p>
<p>neath " Arbitration Court," like the Insolvent Court. " No. .

</p>

</p>
<p>This is what I call the process for bringing in the party, and making
</p>
<p>him amenable to the jurisdiction of the Court. After this they are
</p>
<p>called on to sign a deed of submission no doubt, and it is said that
</p>
<p>that is similar to the ordinary cases of reference to arbitration. But,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, there is this difference, that the submission in the ordi-
</p>
<p>nary case is made a rule of Court, and the obedience to the award is
</p>
<p>to be enforced by the authority of the Court. It is neither more
</p>
<p>nor less than an appeal to the regular constituted tribunals of the
</p>
<p>land ; whereas here there is nothing of that kind, no reference to
</p>
<p>any Court at all. The only sanction is the Report of the Committee.
</p>
<p>If the parties, on being examined, do not give satisfactory reasons for
</p>
<p>not complying with the award, they shall be expelled the Association.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside says, in all cases of arbitration, a summons is issued.
</p>
<p>Yes, but by whom ? By the Arbitrator who is appointed. As soon
</p>
<p>as the two parties sign a deed of submission, then he issues his sum-
</p>
<p>mons, the parties having given him power. This, on the contrary, is
</p>
<p>a summons by the litigant party to his adversary, to come before the
</p>
<p>Court, and have the matter adjudicated on by them ; and this at the
</p>
<p>peril of the penalties denounced by the Committee against persons
</p>
<p>who shall not think fit to comply with the injunctions contained
</p>
<p>in it.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, the meeting at which this Report was
</p>
<p>agreed to, was held on the 23rd of August. The very next day the

</p>
<p>Queen's Speech was delivered, at the closing of the session of Par-
</p>
<p>liament. Observe, Gentlemen, up to this time there is not a single
</p>
<p>petition presented to the House of Commons. Recollect that not a
</p>
<p>single petition is proved to have been presented to the House of
</p>
<p>Commons, from the opening of the session down to the 24th of
</p>
<p>August, when it was closed. Nay, more, not one petition has been
</p>
<p>proved to have been signed by any body of persons. It has been
</p>
<p>shown, indeed, that resolutions were entered into to petition, but no
</p>
<p>petition has been proved ; and the session of Parliament is suffered to
</p>
<p>elapse without the subject of the Repeal of the Union, as far as the
</p>
<p>evidence goes, being at all brought under the consideration of the
</p>
<p>Legislature. However, the agitation had been going on, these meet-
</p>
<p>ings had been taking place, the public mind was disquieted on the
</p>
<p>matter, and the Queen's Speech, which was read in evidence, thus ad-
</p>
<p>verts to the subject: " I have observed, with the deepest concern,
</p>
<p>" the persevering efforts which are made to stir up discontent and dis-
</p>
<p>744
</p>
<p>" affection among my subjects in Ireland, and to excite them to de-
</p>
<p>" mand a Repeal of the Legislative Union. It has been, and ever
</p>
<p>" will be, my earnest desire to administer the government of that
</p>
<p>" country in a spirit of strict justice and impartiality, and to co-ope-
</p>
<p>* rate with Parliament in effecting such amendments of existing laws
</p>
<p>" as may tend to improve the social condition, and to develope the
</p>
<p>" natural resources of Ireland. From a sincere conviction that the
</p>
<p>" Legislative Union is not less essential to the attainment of these
</p>
<p>" objects than to the strength and stability of the empire, it is my
</p>
<p>" firm determination, with your support, and under the blessing of
</p>
<p>" Divine Providence, to maintain inviolate that great bond of con-
</p>
<p>" nexion between the two countries. I have foreborne from requir-
</p>
<p>" ing any additional powers for the counteraction of designs hostile
</p>
<p>" to the concord and welfare of my dominions, as well from my un-
</p>
<p>" willingness to distrust the efficacy of the ordinary law, as from my re-
</p>
<p>" liance on the good sense and patriotism of my people, and on the
</p>
<p>" solemn declarations of Parliament in support of the Legislative'
</p>
<p>'< Union."
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  I do not think that document was
</p>
<p>admitted in evidence for any purpose, except for the purpose of show-
</p>
<p>ing that on that day a Gazette was issued.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin.  You recollect, Mr. Henn applied to you
</p>
<p>to know if you made use of it for any other purpose.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General.  The only purpose I intend to use it for
</p>
<p>is this, to inform the jury that the 24th of August was the day on
</p>
<p>which the speech was delivered, and the session closed. I agree with
</p>
<p>your Lordships, that I ought not to use it for any other purpose, and
</p>
<p>I shall confine myself within the most rigid rules of evidence. I feel
</p>
<p>that in my position I ought not to attempt to urge anything beyond
</p>
<p>those limits. On the 24th of August, then, the session closed, and
</p>
<p>without any petition being presented, as far as the evidence appears.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, very shortly after that speech had been delivered, you
</p>
<p>will find Mr. Duffy publishing in his paper an article dated the 26th
</p>
<p>of August, entitled " The Crisis is upon us." " Our Union with

</p>
<p>" Act. The natural rights of the people were trampled down, in
</p>
<p>w utter disregard of the forms and spirit of the Constitution. The
</p>
<p>" statesman's wisdom and the lawyer's learning lent authority to the
</p>
<p>" instinctive repudiation of the patriot. Saurin, amongst others, de-
</p>
<p>" clared that resistance was a question of time and prudence, and
</p>
<p>u would become a duty whenever strength and opportunity might con-
</p>
<p>" cur in justifying the effort for its abrogation. A greater than Sau~
</p>
<p>" rin has at length given forth the irrevocable voice  resistance to
</p>
<p>" the Union has become a duty." Now this was two days after
</p>
<p>the prorogation of Parliament. " Resistance to the Union has become
</p>
<p>a duty." Does that mean resistance by petitioning, after months
</p>
<p>have been suffered to elapse without a petition, and after Parliament
</p>
<p>had separated? "Resistance to the Union has become a duty.
</p>
<p>" This, the forty-third year of provincial degradation, may if th e
</p>
<p>745
</p>
<p>u people have worth and energy, become the first of restored inde-
</p>
<p>" pendence." How? How is it to become the year of restored in-
</p>
<p>dependence, Parliament having separated ? Has that question been
</p>
<p>answered by any of the Gentlemen on the other side ? This docu-
</p>
<p>ment was read ; they all had it in their briefs ; it was read over and
</p>
<p>over again ; they perfectly well knew the contents of it. Has any
</p>
<p>explanation been given by Mr. Duffy of the meaning of "resistance
</p>
<p>to the Union," or making the year 1843 the year of restored inde-
</p>
<p>pendence, the Parliament through whose instrumentality that could
</p>
<p>be effected having separated? "The knot which had baffled every
</p>
<p>" attempt to unravel its complications has been severed with one final,
</p>
<p>" decisive blow, struck with the sword of peace consecrated on the
</p>
<p>" height of Tara." I ask how it was proposed this should be done,
</p>
<p>Parliament having been prorogued. The article goes on : " There
</p>
<p>" is a way, if there exists a will, for the liberation of Ireland  for the
</p>
<p>" reconstruction of her Legislature. The case between the people
</p>
<p>" and her leaders stands thus." You would not understand from the
</p>
<p>title of this article, " The Crisis is upon us," what the writer would
</p>
<p>intend to convey or do. You will find the several efforts that had
</p>
<p>been made, on the one hand by the leaders, as he calls them, and on
</p>
<p>the other hand by the people  one mutually answering the call of
</p>
<p>the other ; and he proceeds to contrast what each had done, and to
</p>
<p>draw a parallel between them, and lay before the Irish people the
</p>
<p>exact condition in which the question between the leaders and the
</p>
<p>people then stood. The case between the people and their leaders
</p>
<p>stands thus : " In a season of apparent apathy to the high and holy
</p>
<p>" impulses of nationality, when cicatrization seemed superinduced bv
</p>
<p>" Whig palliatives, and the wound inflicted on our Irish pride and
</p>
<p>" honour no longer gaped and bled ; O'Connell tore asunder the
</p>
<p>" bandages and revealed to Ireland the exact seat and true character
</p>
<p>" of her social and political disease." What is the meaning of that ?
</p>
<p>The people were quiet enough. The people were not disposed to
</p>
<p>be troublesome, or to be riotous, and are not riotous. The people
</p>
<p>were not disposed to join in anything like a public demonstration or

<p>movement. They laboured under what this writer calls " apathy
</p>
<p>to the high and holy impulses of nationality." They were quiet,
</p>
<p>" when cicatrization seemed superinduced by Whig palliatives, and the
</p>
<p>" wound inflicted on our Irish pride and honour no longer gaped and
</p>
<p>" bled." That is to say, certain measures were introduced by the
</p>
<p>members of that administration for the redress of the supposed
</p>
<p>grievances of Ireland, what he calls " Whig palliatives," and as
</p>
<p>long as that was the case the people were quiet and were dis-
</p>
<p>posed to be quiet ; " but O'Connell tore asunder the bandages,
</p>
<p>" and revealed to Ireland the exact seat and true character of
</p>
<p>" her social and political disease." That is to say, he was the
</p>
<p>person who had created this agitation, torn off the bandages, as
</p>
<p>it is expressed, and induced the people to rouse themselves from
</p>
<p>that apathy into which they had fallen, in consequence of the Whin-
</p>
<p>palliatives resorted to by the administration of the day. " He cast
</p>
<p>" to the winds the soothing system, and aroused his countrymen from
</p>
<p>5c
</p>
<p>74G
</p>
<p>" the delirious repose, produced by dependance on the sympathies of
</p>
<p>" foreign faction. The memories of the past, blending glorious tra-
</p>
<p>" ditions of remote days with recollections of modern '82, were
</p>
<p>" appealed to, the necessities of the present time were bared to view
</p>
<p>" in their appalling reality, the hopes of the future were invoked,
</p>
<p>" until by every varied argument addressed to their judgment and
</p>
<p>" their feelings, their own firesides, the tombs of their fathers, the
</p>
<p>" cradles of their children, he so wrought upon the millions that they
</p>
<p>" answered his invitation to come forth from bondage with the una-
</p>
<p>" nimity of one man." That is to say, here the leader was active,
</p>
<p>and did his part. " It seemed as if the time had come to evoke the
</p>
<p>" slumbering might of that Irish army which the legend tells us was
</p>
<p>" doomed to sleep entranced in panoplied array, until aroused by
</p>
<p>" some potent spell, for the expulsion of foreign tyrants. So sudden,
</p>
<p>" so enthusiastic, so resistless was the response of the Irish mind to
</p>
<p>" the call of the Irish leader ! Meeting was held after meeting, each
</p>
<p>" exceeding its predecessor in numbers, and all, without excep-
</p>
<p>" tion, challenging respect for the demeanor of the masses who
</p>
<p> attended."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, in the early part of my address to you, I stated, that
</p>
<p>I did not attach any value whatever to what was said or done in the
</p>
<p>Repeal Association during the years 1841 and 1842. We are prose-
</p>
<p>cuting here the proceedings of the year 1843, each of them in the
</p>
<p>manner I have detailed to you, leading to the gradual usurpation of
</p>
<p>all the functions of the state. These are the features which we say
</p>
<p>are illegal, and which we make the subject of prosecution. And the
</p>
<p>question now at issue is, are these proceedings consistent with the
</p>
<p>law of the land ? Is this plan, thus organized, legal or not legal ?
</p>
<p>Have we or not a common law sufficient to meet it? If the common
</p>
<p>law be sufficient, we can meet it ; if the common law be not suffi-
</p>
<p>cient, it will then remain to be considered what is to be done. I
</p>
<p>mean not to coerce your verdict in any way, but merely to say that
</p>
<p>the ordinary powers of the law will be resorted to in the first in-
</p>
<p>stance, by taking the opinion of the constitutional tribunals of the

</p>
<p>country on the question, whether these proceedings are or are not
</p>
<p>legal. Having now detailed all the apathy into which the country
</p>
<p>sank from << Whig palliatives," the writer goes on: " The million.
</p>
<p>" shout of Tara completed the proof, and Hung back the responsi-
</p>
<p>" bility again upon the leaders." The people had so far answered
</p>
<p>the call that they had done their duty. " Yes! the people had suf-
</p>
<p><{ ficiently shown their willingness and worthiness to be led, by a thou-
</p>
<p> sand proofs of devotion to the cause of fidelity to their leaders.
</p>
<p>" Whither and when ? began to be asked, ere the echoes of Tara had
</p>
<p>" died upon the public ear." Led when and led whither ? Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>there is no ambiguity in that. " The people called upon their leaders."
</p>
<p>" You have stated to us that we ought to be ready. We are ready.
</p>
<p>" When do you want us? Whither are we to go? We fling the
</p>
<p>" responsibility back on you ; answer us now our question. The lead-
</p>
<p>" ers have answered, and the responsibility is again on the people.
</p>
<p>" The Rubicon has been crossed by the promulgation of a plan for
</p>
<p>747
</p>
<p>u the reconstruction of an Irish legislature." Gentlemen, this cross-
</p>
<p>ing the Rubicon is the thing, the nature of which we want to have as-
</p>
<p>certained  the legality of which we wish to have determined. They
</p>
<p>have crossed the Rubicon by the reconstruction of this Irish Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment, by the means they have adopted for the purpose of bringing it
</p>
<p>forward ; and the question is, whether in that they have, or have not
</p>
<p>acted consistently with the law. " The Rubicon has been crossed by
</p>
<p>" the promulgation of a plan for the reconstruction of an Irish Legisla-
</p>
<p>" ture. For weal or for woe, for ages of bondage or centuries of in-
</p>
<p>" dependence, we stand committed. Forward and prompt action is
</p>
<p>(i sure of its reward, in speedy and glorious triumph  the criminal
</p>
<p>u abandonment of opportunity is equally certain to be avenged in the
</p>
<p>u perpetuation of misrule. In the making or marring of our own for-
</p>
<p>" tunes, we involve to an incalculable extent the hopes of the whole
</p>
<p>" human family. We have gloried in the irresistible efficacy of a new
</p>
<p>" element in political warfare, which we boast to have invented, and
</p>
<p>" by whose employment we have already won many outposts. Will
</p>
<p>" the principle or the men fail now in this last decisive struggle ?
</p>
<p>" Shall the nations who have given us their admiration, and sympa-
</p>
<p>" thy, and trust, mock at us for braggarts  our children's children
</p>
<p>" curse our memories as they spit on our dishonoured clay ? The
</p>
<p>" world looks to our country for an example. Ireland must become
</p>
<p>" a nation now, or continue a province for ever ! We purposely
</p>
<p>" postpone critical details of the plan submitted under the sanction of
</p>
<p>" O'Connell's name, and with the authority of the Association  con-
</p>
<p>" tenting ourselves to admire, and inviting our countrymen to admire
</p>
<p>" with us, the symmetry of the temple of freedom raised for their re-
</p>
<p>" ception. The portals stand open ; the genius of '82 has consecrated
</p>
<p>" the edifice ; there may be a bench removed with advantage, or an
</p>
<p>" alteration of internal arrangement with convenience, but the exi-
</p>
<p>" gency of the hour is to secure the possession, and appropriate the
</p>
<p>"structure to the sacred uses of self-legislation. The number of
</p>
<p>" representatives who will occupy seats in the future Irish House of

<p>" Commons, happens to coincide with that determined upon as the

</p>
<p>" most eligible limit for the intended Preservative Society." Here,
</p>
<p>you see, Mr. Duffy treats the thing as unfait accompli; as if the whole
</p>
<p>thing were accomplished. " It is desirable, for many reasons, that
</p>
<p>" the distribution of representation should be the same, so that the
</p>
<p>" transition may be easy and natural to the recognized and technical-
</p>
<p>" ly legal condition of a Parliament. The chosen trustees of the peo-
</p>
<p>" pie's money now"  your Lordships will recollect the use of that
</p>
<p>phrase in the early part of the case  " will have the first claim upon
</p>
<p>" their votes hereafter. Much inconvenience will be prevented by
</p>
<p>" limiting the number strictly according to the schedule submitted to
</p>
<p>" the nation in the plan of the Association. Constituencies  as they
</p>
<p>" will be  districts as they are  having greater enthusiasm in the
</p>
<p>" cause, or enabled to contribute more liberally to the qualifying
</p>
<p>" fund than others, can transfer to less fortunate localities their sur-
</p>
<p>" plus of ability and pecuniary weight, with advantage and honour to
</p>
<p>*} both parties. On the character of the gentlemen who will be in-
</p>
<p>748
</p>
<p>" vested with the confidence of the people, as members of the Preser-
</p>
<p>" vative Society [that is a society, of which your Lordships will
</p>
<p>soon hear more] will depend, in a great measure, the destinies of
</p>
<p>" Ireland. They must be men  not mere talking or voting machines,
</p>
<p>* earnest men with hearts, and rational men with heads, having
</p>
<p>" brains in them as well as tongues  self-reliant men, that each may
</p>
<p>" regulate his conduct as if the fate of the national cause rested
</p>
<p>" on his individual exertions  not vainly confident, that from the
</p>
<p>" highest downwards, they may one and all determine and act with
</p>
<p>" the concentrated authority of a body. Men, in fine, whose per-
</p>
<p>" sonal character will secure respect. Caution in such a choice
</p>
<p>" is indispensable for the credit of the people, lest they be shamed
</p>
<p>" or betrayed. We urge these considerations at once, because we
</p>
<p>" know that another step in advance has been resolved on, and will
</p>
<p>" probably be announced at the next meeting of the Association.
</p>
<p>" The hour is approaching which will test the leaders of the people,
</p>
<p>" and try the souls of the millions. The curtain has risen on the
</p>
<p>" fifth act of the drama; shall it fall to hide from the world's scornful
</p>
<p>" gaze the disgraceful sight of our efforts, baffled through our own
</p>
<p>" weakness and criminal folly; or descend amidst the applause of ad-
</p>
<p>" miring nations, upon the sublime spectacle of a happy and emanci-
</p>
<p>" pated people, chaunting in harmony their song of peace and blood-
</p>
<p>" less triumph ? ' Men of Ireland, in your own hands is the issue !' "
</p>
<p>I have now to advert to a meeting of the Association, at which a
</p>
<p>very remarkable speech was made, which has been deposed to by two
</p>
<p>witnesses. The Association meeting to which I at present allude,
</p>
<p>took place on the 28th of August. There were present Mr. Steele,
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, Mr. John O'Connell, Mr. Ray, and Dr. Gray. Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell stated, that he was ready to make any alteration that
</p>
<p>might be thought fit, or proposed in the plan for the renewed action
</p>
<p>of the Irish Parliament ; and he made a speech, which will in some
</p>
<p>measure explain a passage in that last document, as to the step in
</p>
<p>advance, which was foretold by Mr. Duffy. " Mr. O'Connell then
</p>
<p>" adverted to the plan which he had proposed at the last meeting, of

</p>
<p>" a constitution for an Irish Parliament. He had taken as the basis
</p>
<p>" of his plan, the population returns of 1831, which could not be
</p>
<p>" suspected of having been drawn up for any purpose connected with
</p>
<p>" the Repeal of the Union. He was disposed to adhere to the cen-
</p>
<p>" sus, unless serious errors could be pointed out in any particular de-
</p>
<p>" tails. He had been asked why Cavan was not included in the list
</p>
<p>" of boroughs which were to return members ; his answer was, that
</p>
<p>" no town was included which did not contain a population of at least
</p>
<p>" 3,000 persons. It was to be expected, that difficulties would occur
</p>
<p>" in adapting the plan to the circumstances of various localities. This
</p>
<p>" had been found to be the case under the Reform Act. To obvi-
</p>
<p>" ate these difficulties as much as possible, he would propose that a
</p>
<p>" Repeal Warden should be sent to each of two towns which stood
</p>
<p>" first in the representative plan, namely, Ardee and Arklow. It
</p>
<p>" should be their duty, first, to ascertain the number of householders ;
</p>
<p> secondly, the number of married men ; and thirdly, the number of
</p>
<p>749
</p>
<p>" Repealers in each town. This would be attended with some ex-
</p>
<p>" pense, for it would be necessary to have clerks and books ; but the
</p>
<p>" expense was one which he trusted the Association would cheer-
</p>
<p>" fully incur. The object of the proceeding was, to make the dis-
</p>
<p>" trict Repeal Wardens a kind of returning officers whose duty it
</p>
<p>" would be to communicate with the Association. They would
</p>
<p>" have no other authority ; no authority as delegates, or representa-
</p>
<p>" tives, or anything of that kind. He knew that in point of common
</p>
<p>" sense and fact, no delegation could be imputed to them, but
</p>
<p>" he thought it was better to make the thing known, because that
</p>
<p>" would preclude any dispute. No one could be a Repeal War-
</p>
<p>" den without previously being a member of the Association ; he
</p>
<p>" would therefore be one of themselves." He continues : " If this
</p>
<p>*' plan succeeds in Ardee and Arklow, we can go on to other
</p>
<p>" towns and take them seriatim. It is most important to the
</p>
<p>" Irish nation to know how the source of its representative body
</p>
<p>" shall be. We know the Queen, and submit cheerfully and
</p>
<p>" readily to her authority ; we know the House of Lords, and sub-
</p>
<p>" mit to its authority. The Irish House of Commons is practically
</p>
<p>" broken up ; the different boroughs were bought and sold ; and let
</p>
<p>" it not be said, that it is an unconstitutional act to have represen-
</p>
<p>" tatives for places, that once had representatives in the Irish Parlia-
</p>
<p>" ment. Nothing is more familiar to those acquainted with the re-
</p>
<p>" presentation of Great Britain, than that many towns which formerly
</p>
<p>" returned members to the English House of Commons did not do
</p>
<p>" so at the time of the Reform Bill." Then he goes on : " This is
</p>
<p>" another of the steps that I am taking, deliberately and legally,
</p>
<p>*i in the prosecution of my plan. I expose no man to danger. I
</p>
<p>" will take my steps by degrees till I have Ireland so arranged, that
</p>
<p>" it will be the wisest and (speaking constitutionally) safest for the
</p>
<p>" British minister to yield at once, and not think of refusing a nation
</p>
<p>" that which that nation has a right to demand." That is pretty plain
</p>
<p>language. " When I opened the subject at first, my ideas were
</p>
<p>" more crude than they are at present. The nearer I approach the

</p>
<p>" working out of the plan, the greater are the difficulties which lie
</p>
<p>* in my way." That is to say, the thing had not been fully con.
</p>
<p>cocted. " More crude than they are at present ; the nearer I ap-
</p>
<p>" proach the working out of the plan, the greater are the difficulties
</p>
<p>" which lie in my way." So I think he will find. " I must so ar-
</p>
<p>" range my proceedings, that no construction of law shall ever reach
</p>
<p>" them. We must keep within the particular letter and spirit of the
</p>
<p>u law, as far as the spirit is embodied in the principle that penal and
</p>
<p>" restrictive Statutes are always to be construed closely and in the
</p>
<p>" most restrictive sense. I, therefore, wish it to be known that I am
</p>
<p>" not at present prepared, nor do I think it necessary, with the
</p>
<p>" scheme of the Preservative Association." That is the new one.
</p>
<p>" But I am now working out my plan for the constitution of the Irish
</p>
<p>" House of Commons, when it shall be established by Act of Par-
</p>
<p>" liament, or the exercise of the prerogative of the Crown." We thus
</p>
<p>have the next step announced in the progress of this confederacy.
</p>
<p>750
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, it appears that the army was not lost sight of all
</p>
<p>this time. Articles appeared with a view either to neutralize them,
</p>
<p>or at all events to induce the people to believe that they would be
</p>
<p>passive, in case any emergency should arise. Yon will recollect I
</p>
<p>read to you an article of the 10th of June, 1843, called The Morality
</p>
<p>of War, published in the Nation newspaper, which is Mr. DulFy's
</p>
<p>paper. You remember that the " Morality of War" there incul-
</p>
<p>cated is this, that the writer tells the soldiers that in certain cases it
</p>
<p>will be lawful for them to obey their officers, and in others not ;
</p>
<p>thus : " If a man fights in the ranks of an invader or a tyrant if he
</p>
<p>"fight against the cause of liberty, and against the land that gave
</p>
<p>" him birth, may his banner be trampled, and his sword broke in a
</p>
<p>" disastrous battle, and may his name rot in eternal infamy ! But
</p>
<p>" if he fight for truth, country, and freedom, may fortune smile on
</p>
<p>" his arms, may victory charge by his side." That is " The Morality
</p>
<p>of War" inculcated on the 10th of June, by Mr. Duffy. Now,
</p>
<p>we have Mr. Barrett on the same subject, or one somewhat simi-
</p>
<p>lar to it, in the publication in his newspaper, the Pilot of the
</p>
<p>28th of August, 1843. It is entitled " The Duty of a Soldier."
</p>
<p>That is another expression for " The Morality of War." The object
</p>
<p>of each of these publishers is to inculcate on the soldiers of the army
</p>
<p>their duties. This bears date the 28th of August, and is signed,
</p>
<p>" Richard Power." I shall make observations on the article itself,
</p>
<p>but none on Mr. Power's absence ; I think it would not be right to
</p>
<p>do so after what was said. I shall just call you attention to some
</p>
<p>passages in this article. There is a long preface, and then it says :
</p>
<p>" There are three millions of as brave men as ever trod the grass,
</p>
<p>" united as one ('a sufficient number to conquer Europe'), ready at
</p>
<p>" a signal, and determined to die, or have full and ample justice ;
</p>
<p>" and yet, I don't fear to assert it, there is not one man amongst
</p>
<p>" them who hopes to obtain one shilling's worth of any man's pro-
</p>
<p>" perty, or who intends to do the slightest personal injury to any
</p>
<p>" human being by joining in the great national revolution, upon
</p>
<p>" which they are now unalterably determined. This is the highest

<p>" degree of political training to which a nation ever yet was brought.
</p>
<p>" It is a condition of society which no one ever imagined until the
</p>
<p>" great apostle of peaceful agitation has exhibited it to the astonish-
</p>
<p>11 ment of the world. This, after all, is not depriving the thief of
</p>
<p>tl his physical force, but creating an overwhelming force which he

</p>
<p>" that no other thief can use it  its animating principle being jus-

<p>" tice  peace, if possible  but, peace or war, justice." Peace or
</p>
<p>war ! ' There is one class of persons whom Mr. O'Connell has not
</p>
<p>" taken into his school in his lectures upon political rights and duties,
</p>
<p>" but who have, it seems, profited, notwithstanding, to some extent,
</p>
<p>" of his peaceful doctrines  I mean the military." " Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>" has not taken that class of persons into his school ; it remains for
</p>
<p>" me to discharge that part of the common duty." Accordingly he

<p>goes on : " Mr. O'Connell is the best abused man in the world; his
</p>
<p>" motives are misconstrued, his objects misrepresented, his character
</p>
<p>751
</p>
<p>" maligned, his person insulted, and his conduct held up to scorn 
</p>
<p>" his course must be cautious. If he touched upon this subject, he
</p>
<p>" would be cried up at once as an open rebel." Jfhe touched i/pon
</p>
<p>it. You see the meaning of that sentence. Mr. O'Connell lias al-
</p>
<p>ways preached peace, and always counselled his followers not to in-
</p>
<p>terfere with the military or police, and not to become members of
</p>
<p>Ribbon societies, or anything of that sort ; he has always preserved
</p>
<p>what he calls a peaceful agitation. Mr. Barrett says, " If he touched
</p>
<p>" upon the subject of the army, he might at once be treated as an
</p>
<p>" open rebel.'' The author goes on. [The Solicitor General then
</p>
<p>read the remainder of the letter, see ante, page 113]. One asks
</p>
<p>naturally, why the thing is written at all ? It has not been ex-
</p>
<p>plained, why it was published, or why the Rev. Mr. Power, of Kil-
</p>
<p>rossenty, thought it his duty to instruct her Majesty's army in the dis-
</p>
<p>charge of their duties ; in what case they were bound to obey, and in
</p>
<p>what case they were bound to disobey. The reason for this inter-
</p>
<p>ference is not assigned ; and when he says, he does " not mean to
</p>
<p>" make any practical application of the doctrine to this or any other
</p>
<p>" country," it will be for you to say, what other intention he could
</p>
<p>have had. I am merely using this as Mr. Barrett's act ; we have no
</p>
<p>right to do otherwise, as it was published only in his paper. He
</p>
<p>says : " I put it forward solely as an adjunct to Mr. O'ConnelPs
</p>
<p>" general theory of peaceful agitation, which would bring about every
</p>
<p>" amelioration in the condition of mankind, by instructing every
</p>
<p>" class of the community in the moral duties they owe to each
</p>
<p>" other." That is the reason he assigns for instructing the soldiery
</p>
<p>in their duties. Now, I think you will have no doubt, on comparing
</p>
<p>this document of the 28th of August in the Pilot, with the document
</p>
<p>of the 10th of June in the Nation, that the two publishers had the
</p>
<p>same common design, and that that common design was in accordance
</p>
<p>with the plan of Mr. O'Connell and those associated with him,
</p>
<p>namely, to introduce into the army a spirit of  I will call it no more
</p>
<p>than  reluctance to interfere and do their duty, should any emer-
</p>
<p>gency arise to render it necessary to call on them to discharge their

</p>
<p>duty to their officers. This is instructing them how to guide them-
</p>
<p>selves in such an event. If they were to follow the doctrines these
</p>
<p>papers inculcate, they would ask themselves, "is this a just war  is
</p>
<p>"this an occasion on which I should obey my superior officer?"
</p>
<p>And, recollect, this is in a publication avowed to be an adjunct to
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell's scheme, and to the following it out.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, a meeting took place on the 29th of August, the
</p>
<p>day following this publication, to which it will be necessary to re-
</p>
<p>quest your particular attention. When I use that word, always
</p>
<p>understand me as not doing so because your attention has not been
</p>
<p>marked ; on the contrary, it has, from the commencement of this
</p>
<p>trial, been most extraordinary. I claim your particular attention
</p>
<p>simply because there is a passage in Mr. O'Connell's speech which
</p>
<p>appears to me to be strongly characteristic of the meeting, and of
</p>
<p>the intentions of those concerned in the proceedings. You will re-
</p>
<p>collect, Mr. Jackson deposed to his having been present at the
</p>
<p>752
</p>
<p>Association on the 29th of August, when Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Ray,
</p>
<p>and Mr. John O'Connell were present ; and Mr. Jackson, who did
</p>
<p>not take short-hand notes, but only gave you a summary of what
</p>
<p>took place from the materials which he had collected, states, that Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell alluded to 1829, that is, the period of the Emancipation Act,
</p>
<p>and the year 1843; and he said that twenty-six years of despotism had
</p>
<p>passed; that he denounced the Whigs as "base, brutal, and' bloody ;
</p>
<p>that the magisterial bench had been cleared of every friend of Ireland;
</p>
<p>that the people were so discontented, and the country so disatisfied,
</p>
<p>that if the Union were not now dissolved, there would be asanguinary
</p>
<p>civil war. " Perhaps," said he, " not in my time, for I will leave it
</p>
<p>as a legacy to those who come after me ;" and he added, " it might
</p>
<p>not be an unadvisable result." That was Mr. Jackson's evidence, on
</p>
<p>which strong observations have been made ; and it has been broadly
</p>
<p>asserted that that language was not used, and that Mr. Jackson was
</p>
<p>either mistaken, or wilfully misrepresenting, when he charged Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell with having used those expressions. Indeed, unless my
</p>
<p>memory fails me, they actually undertook to produce a witness to
</p>
<p>contradict Mr. Jackson in that particular. Well, Mr. Jackson has
</p>
<p>sworn positively to the use of those expressions, but I have to recal
</p>
<p>to your recollection, that the proceedings of this 29th of August are
</p>
<p>not resting on the testimony of Mr. Jackson alone, because Mr. Ross,
</p>
<p>the short-hand writer, was also at this meeting, as well as Mr. Jack-
</p>
<p>son ; and Mr. Ross read his note to the jury, a copy of which I have ;
</p>
<p>and I beg leave to direct the attention of the jury to some passages
</p>
<p>in the speech of Mr. O'Connell, as taken in short-hand by that gentle-
</p>
<p>man. He said : " It is my business to show it to the Public and to
</p>
<p>" the universe  for foreign nations have their eyes upon us, as well as
</p>
<p>" the inhabitants of these realms. It is my business to vindicate the
</p>
<p>" faithful people of Ireland from any guilt in the discontent that uni-
</p>
<p>" versally prevails, but which manifests itself in so peaceable and con-
</p>
<p>" stitutional a manner." He then goes into the usual topics about
</p>
<p>1782, and the Union ; and after stating the prosperity which he says
</p>
<p>existed between 1782 and 1799, he adds : " I have another testimo-

</p>
<p>" nial in favour of this prosperity, more eloquent than anything I can
</p>
<p>" offer: it is in a book published in 1823, long before the Repeal
</p>
<p>" agitation was thought of." " In 1823, long before the Repeal agita-
</p>
<p>tion was thought of," this book was published ; that is to say, twenty-
</p>
<p>four or twenty-five years were suffered to elapse, duringall which time
</p>
<p>these grievances were existing, and no attempt to get up an agitation
</p>
<p>till after 1823. It is not in evidence when, from J 810, down to the
</p>
<p>present time, Mr. O'Connell began this agitation ; it is not stated that
</p>
<p>anything was in agitation about the Union. " No man spoke of Re-
</p>
<p>peal at that time excepting myself." We are not charging him with
</p>
<p>inconsistency ; we give him credit for having entertained those senti-
</p>
<p>ments from his earliest youth. " For, in looking for Catholic Eman-
</p>
<p>" cipation, I always said I looked to it only as a step towards Repeal.
</p>
<p>" I always avowed that sentiment cautiously, and, perhaps, with even
</p>
<p>" unnecessary repetition, lest that should happen, which, notwith-
</p>
<p>" standing all my caution, has happened, that I should be accused of
</p>
<p>753
</p>
<p>" concealing the desire for Repeal till England made fair concessions,
</p>
<p>" which they would not, if Repeal was in the rear of Emancipation."
</p>
<p>He then, in a subsequent part of the speech, says : " Let it be re-
</p>
<p>marked, I am not speaking disparagingly of the Queen." The
</p>
<p>Queen's Speech had by this time reached Ireland. " I am not
</p>
<p>" speaking disparagingly of the Queen. I distinguish, emphati-
</p>
<p>" cally, her acts from the acts of her ministers. I heard Wil-
</p>
<p>" liana the Fourth pronounce a violent Philippic against me; for
</p>
<p>" Kings condescend to scold me, and Queens sometimes speak
</p>
<p>" harshlv of me ; and five minutes after I heard the speech from the
</p>
<p>" Kind's lips, I proclaimed it, because it was the Minister's Speech,
</p>
<p>" base, brutal, and bloody. I have never retracted that sentence
</p>
<p>" since the day I uttered it."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I do not dispute the soundness of the constitutional
</p>
<p>doctrine, that the Minister of the Sovereign is the person responsible
</p>
<p>for the acts of Government. The theory of our Constitution is, that
</p>
<p>the Sovereign can do no wrong ; and it would be disloyalty in that
</p>
<p>sense of the word, to impute to the Queen personally, or to make
</p>
<p>the Queen responsible personally, for anything done by the advice
</p>
<p>of her Ministers. But 1 do not understand that degree of loyalty,
</p>
<p>or that species of loyalty, nor do I understand that description of
</p>
<p>constitutional doctrine, which says this, that what has been delivered
</p>
<p>in person by the Sovereign, though by the advice of her ministers,
</p>
<p>is not the expression of her sentiments, as entertained at the time;
</p>
<p>but that she has been playing the hypocrite, and pronouncing senti-
</p>
<p>ments which she does not really profess and entertain. When I
</p>
<p>come to advert to some passages in Mr. O'ConnelPs remarks on the
</p>
<p>Queen's Speech, you will find that it is not his doctrine that the
</p>
<p>ministers are responsible for that speech as their's, but what he
</p>
<p>teaches the people to believe is, that the ministers have put into her
</p>
<p>mouth that which she was not inclined to speak, and that she really
</p>
<p>delivered to the people of England, and her dominions, sentiments
</p>
<p>contrary to her own, and which were forced on her by the Ministry
</p>
<p>whom she had in her councils. That is not what I call either loyal

</p>
<p>or constitutional doctrine, " The present speech is an excess of
</p>
<p>" stupidity and insolence combined. It is the speech of Ministers,
</p>
<p>" not of the Queen ; and I hope that will be infused into every Irish
</p>
<p>'' mind. The Tories have her in their power, and choose to make
</p>
<p>" her deliver the speech which they dictated. She could not help
</p>
<p>" it. If she had turned them out of power, their parliamentary ma-
</p>
<p>" jority would have sent them back triumphant to compel her to say
</p>
<p>" whatever they pleased to put into her lips." The constitutional
</p>
<p>doctrine is, that the Queen is not responsible for what she does say ;
</p>
<p>but it is not constitutional doctrine to say, that any majority or Minis-
</p>
<p>try has forced into the lips of the Sovereign that which the Sovereign
</p>
<p>was not willing to say. " It is the Minister's speech, and not her's."
</p>
<p>So it is in one sense. " I wish they had been advised to allow the
</p>
<p>" speech to be spoken by commission. I wish they had not carried
</p>
<p>" the thraldom over her to the extent of making her speak those
</p>
<p>" things herself." That is, I wish they would not expose Her Ma-
</p>
<p>5D
</p>
<p>754
</p>
<p>jesty to the humiliation of expressing sentiments which really were
</p>
<p>adverse and contrary to the feelings of her own heart. Well, he
</p>
<p>then goes on : " Is there anything in the Queen speaking that
</p>
<p>" speech to retard us in our career ? Is there not something to
</p>
<p>" stimulate us in our exertions ?" Without saying that the whole body
</p>
<p>of the Irish people are disloyal, I must be allowed to question the
</p>
<p>pretensions of persons using this language to superior loyalty. He
</p>
<p>then comments on the speech, which he reads passage by passage.
</p>
<p>" What a scene for the conqueror of Waterloo? He has the Queen
</p>
<p>" in his hands to make a speech to Parliament, the pride of England
</p>
<p>" before her, and she is made to whine something half piteously, half
</p>
<p>" imploringly, about the zeal of her subjects. The Queen is made to
</p>
<p>" say, I have done something for the good of the Church, but being
</p>
<p>" unable to do more, I leave the rest to the zeal of my subjects. Oh!
</p>
<p>" Duke of Wellington, if poor Napoleon had been alive to witness
</p>
<p>" your defeat." Then there is a paragraph about the Church of Scot-
</p>
<p>land, and he says : " So spoke Peel, Wellington, Stanley, and Gra-
</p>
<p>" ham ; but it is my opinion that the Legislative Union is inconsist-
</p>
<p>" ent with any good object whatever ; that instead of being essential
</p>
<p>" to the strength and stability of the empire, it tends to produce
</p>
<p>" weakness and decay ; instead of being a bond of connexion between
</p>
<p>" the two countries, it is the very thing which puts their continued
</p>
<p>" connexion in jeopardy." Then comes the passage which Mr. Jack-
</p>
<p>son swore that he heard Mr. O'Connell deliver, which they called upon
</p>
<p>the jury to discard, but which they have not called any witness to
</p>
<p>contradict. " For I am perfectly convinced that Ireland is so circum-
</p>
<p>" stanced,that if the Union is not dissolved bylegal and constitution-
</p>
<p>" al means, and above all if it do not take place in my life-time, the
</p>
<p>" result will be a sanguinary struggle for perpetual separation ; and
</p>
<p>" God forbid I should say that would be unjustifiable means to be
</p>
<p>i( used against the perpetuity of the Union." Is Mr. Jackson, or not,
</p>
<p>vindicated, in point of accuracy, in that passage upon which such
</p>
<p>strong observations have been made ? We had it indignantly denied
</p>
<p>that such language had been employed by Mr. O'Connell. We have

</p>
<p>not had any witness to contradict our's ; and we have two witnesses
</p>
<p>concurring  the language not exactly the same, but each of them ta-
</p>
<p>king down substantially the same words. Mr. Jackson did not write
</p>
<p>short-hand, but that this sentiment was expressed by Mr. O'Connell,
</p>
<p>no human being, I think, can doubt. Of course, I need not again
</p>
<p>remind you that they undertook to prodnce witnesses to contradict
</p>
<p>this.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon That is, as to the word " undesirable " only.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor- General.  " Unadvisable."
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  " Unadvisable," or " undesirable."
</p>
<p>The Solicitor' General I am quite content with that.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon.  That was the only word that was intended to
</p>
<p>be questioned in his report, " undesirable " or " unadvisable."
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice Read that sentence over again.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor- General.  " Ireland is so circumstanced, that if
</p>
<p>" the Union is not dissolved by legal and constitutional means, and,
</p>
<p>755
</p>
<p>" above all, if it does not take place in my life-time, the result will be
</p>
<p>** a sanguinary struggle for perpetual separation ; and God forbid I
</p>
<p>" should say that would be unjustifiable means to be used against the
</p>
<p>" perpetuity of the Union ;" and then he goes on : " In despair of
</p>
<p>carrying Repeal"  that is to say, should the thing be despaired
</p>
<p>of, in that event  " in despair of carrying Repeal, I do not say that
</p>
<p>" would be the natural result, or the unavoidable result. All I say
</p>
<p>* is, that while I live I hope my countrymen will never despair.
</p>
<p>" While I exist I will, unless prevented by a Parliament in College-
</p>
<p>" green, not cease to rouse and keep alive the Irish hope, and ani-
</p>
<p>" mate it to legitimate and constitutional exertion. By those means
</p>
<p>M I keep away the danger of despair, and the connexion between the
</p>
<p>" two countries will be maintained, by the expectation of the Irish
</p>
<p>" people that it will be placed on a rational footing; and while I live,
</p>
<p>" at least, Ireland shall struggle legitimately and constitutionally. I
</p>
<p>" bequeath to those who follow me their own course of proceeding."
</p>
<p>As long as I live I shall endeavour to keep the people in the strug-
</p>
<p>gle to obtain the Repeal of the Union legitimately and constitu-
</p>
<p>tionally ; while I live, at least, that shall be the struggle : I will be-
</p>
<p>queath to those who follow me their own course of proceeding. I
</p>
<p>think that is a tolerably good exposition by Mr. O'Connell himself of
</p>
<p>his conception of the actual state of the people of this country, in
</p>
<p>consequence of his organization, when he delivered that speech on the
</p>
<p>29th of August last.
</p>
<p>Well, we come now to a meeting of the 4th of September, at the
</p>
<p>Association, deposed to by Mr. Jackson, at which Mr. Ray, Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell, Mr. Steele, and Mr. John O'Connell, were present. Mr.
</p>
<p>Ray, as Mr. Jackson swears, on that occasion recommended : " That
</p>
<p>" the venders of ballads should circulate The Spirit of the Nation,
</p>
<p>" and abandon the trash they had spread among the people. Mr.
</p>
<p>" O'Connell said he would at Loughrea, where he expected to have
</p>
<p>" three hundred thousand or four hundred thousand persons, appoint
</p>
<p>" two hundred and fifty hired Repealers to keep the peace." The
</p>
<p>speech delivered by Mr.O'Connellupon that occasion was taken by Mr.

</p>
<p>Ross, and I must call your attention to some passages in that speech,
</p>
<p>as appearing from his notes : " I want no revolution ; or, if any, only
</p>
<p>"a return to former times ; such a revolution as 1782 or 1829  a
</p>
<p>u bloodless, stainless revolution  a political change for the better."
</p>
<p>Now mark what follows : " But who can tell me that we have not
</p>
<p>" sufficient resources remaining, even if our present plans should be de-
</p>
<p>" feated?" Hear what the resources are. "The people of Ireland might
</p>
<p>" increase the potato culture, and leave the entire harvest of Ireland
</p>
<p>" uncut." A suggestion of that kind needs no commentary from me.
</p>
<p>" What would be the remedy for that ? Who will tell me that the
</p>
<p>" Repealers of every class might not totally give up the consumption
</p>
<p>" of exciseable articles ?'' You see how the resources are gradually
</p>
<p>developed. " I throw out these things merely to show that if the
</p>
<p>diabolical attempt to createbloodshed should succeed"  that is to say,
</p>
<p>should the military be successful, and should blood be shed, should that
</p>
<p>attempt be successful  "still the people would not be deprived of their
</p>
<p>756
</p>
<p>" resources, and the means of vindicating their cause. Butofcourseldo
</p>
<p>" not suggest them. The harvest is now cut. I speak the day after the
</p>
<p>" fair, and therefore with particular safety. The resolution for non-
</p>
<p>" consumption of exciseable and customable articles is not proposed
</p>
<p>" at present, it is reserved for a greater emergency, but I am far
</p>
<p>" from saying that it may not be proposed. I will shrink from
</p>
<p>" nothing; I will state candidly every thing, and I come now to the
</p>
<p>" actual state in which we are placed. I am sure I shall be forgiven
</p>
<p>" for this discussion, but the matter is of such a nature, that I feel I
</p>
<p>" am doing nothing but my duty, in denouncing the possibility of
</p>
<p>" such a crime. Next Sunday I shall be at Loughrea, when I shall
</p>
<p>" probably have three or four hundred thousand men of Connaught
</p>
<p>" about me ; and I defy all the informers and spies of England to
</p>
<p>" create a disturbance there." He alludes then to the police, and
</p>
<p>says: " I am not abusing the police at all; but this will serve as a
</p>
<p>" caution ; it is quite enough. The Sunday after next I shall attend
</p>
<p>" a meeting at Connemara." One of the things we are to prove in
</p>
<p>this case is, the connexion of these great meetings with the leaders
</p>
<p>in Dublin, and here is one of such proofs. " I shall have certainly a
</p>
<p>" hundred thousand men there ; but my object now is to bring your
</p>
<p>" more immediate attention to my plans. I have talked imaginatively
</p>
<p>" of the resources that may hereafter be necessary. I now come to
</p>
<p>" our present position. We have at present in preparation two sepa-
</p>
<p>" rate and distinct plans. The first is, to arrange the constituency
</p>
<p>" in such a manner, that if the Queen be pleased in six weeks to
</p>
<p>" issue writs calling a new Parliament in Ireland, she might be able
</p>
<p>" at once tc direct them to the proper constituencies. The scheme
</p>
<p>" of the Irish Parliament will very soon be circulated in print. I have
</p>
<p>" received several communications on the subject, some excessively
</p>
<p>" silly. For example, one person discovers that my plan of repre-
</p>
<p>" sentation is not in arithmetical proportion. He is an arithmetical
</p>
<p>" blockhead. I do not pretend to arithmetical equality. I take the
</p>
<p>" reform bill as the basis in round numbers. The Association would
</p>
<p>" be ready to consider any cases in which it could be shown that

<p>u wrong had been done. Mallow is a case in which there is a mis-
</p>
<p>" take. It is put down for one member ; my own opinion is, that
</p>
<p>" Mallow should get two members, and one should be taken from
</p>
<p>" Cork. There are eleven members for Cork, with a rural popula-
</p>
<p>" tion of seven hundred and eighty thousand  nearly as great as that
</p>
<p>" of Wales, which returns twenty-eight members. I wish to work
</p>
<p>" out this plan in all its details, before I form the Council of Three
</p>
<p>" Hundred. What I am now doing, and the Preservative Society,
</p>
<p>" are totally separate, distinct, and unconnected ; and though one
</p>
<p>" will follow the other, they are not cause and effect ; they are sepa-
</p>
<p>11 rate and distinct parts of my plan. They are placed chronologically
</p>
<p>" one after another. We have just transmitted to Arklow and Ardee
</p>
<p>" notice of the appointment of the Repeal Wardens. This shows, as I
</p>
<p>" said before, that we will proceed slowly and deliberately with a full
</p>
<p>" knowledge of facts. The letters, indeed, have not yet left the
</p>
<p>" office, but they will by to-day's post. Of course there can be no
</p>
<p>757
</p>
<p>" reply to a letter that has not reached its destination, but before
</p>
<p>" this day week we shall have a reply ; and I think we ought to take

<p>" up all the boroughs in letter A., and send resolutions similar to

<p>" those sent to Ardee and Arklow, so that we shall have, by this day
</p>
<p>u week, a sufficient number of returns to enable us to form ajudg-
</p>
<p>" ment. What I want is to put these things in working order, so
</p>
<p>" that when any practical difficulty arises it shall not impede the
</p>
<p>" working of the system. I want to know the amount of the consti-
</p>
<p>" tuencies in every district, that we conceive ought to send represen-
</p>
<p>" tatives to the Irish Parliament. It has been said that there ought
</p>
<p>" to be more members than three hundred. I deny it. I think it
</p>
<p>"would be better if the number were rather less; but as three
</p>
<p>" hundred was formerly the number of the Irish Parliament, and
</p>
<p>" as our plan is restoration, on that account I fix our number at
</p>
<p>" three hundred. Counsellor Doheny has offered to take on him-
</p>
<p>" self the arrangement of Tipperary. I shall move that he be re-
</p>
<p>" quested to act as Chief Repeal Warden for Tipperary, temporarily.
</p>
<p>" We will get into no legal difficulty  we will violate no law. There
</p>
<p>" shall be no opportunity for prosecution  no indictment. I will take
</p>
<p>" care that we shall be in the letter, and certainly in the spirit of
</p>
<p>" every act, no matter how comprehensive it may be in its details.
</p>
<p>" The Repeal Wardens will be in the nature of returning officers,
</p>
<p>" and the Queen may even direct writs to them by that designation.
</p>
<p>" That is what I want. I do not want representation, or anything
</p>
<p>" like it. The Repeal Wardens will have no representative or dele-
</p>
<p>" gated authority. They are appointed for the ascertainment of
</p>
<p>" a particular fact." He then goes to the Preservative Society,
</p>
<p>and he says finally : " In 1829, England granted us Emancipation,
</p>
<p>" but not equality. Another topic is the relation between landlord
</p>
<p>" and tenant. The law is most unjust, which gives every thing to
</p>
<p>" the landlord, and nothing to the tenant." One of the offences
</p>
<p>charged in this indictment is, a conspiracy to bring the administration
</p>
<p>of justice into disrepute and contempt, and here we find Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell taking on himself to assert to the people assembled, that the law
</p>

</p>
<p>is unjust, and gives every thing to the landlord and nothing to the
</p>
<p>tenant. He proceeds thus: " Chief Justice Pennefather, in giving
</p>
<p>" judgment, used these remarkable sentiments: 'The entire intent
</p>
<p>" ' of the Act of Parliament is in favour of the landlord to enforce
</p>
<p>" ' his rights ; the law never had the interest of the tenant in con-
</p>
<p>" ' templation at all.'" This is holding out the authority of this
</p>
<p>high Court for this position, " that the law never had the interest of
</p>
<p>the tenant in contemplation at all." He says : " Those are the
</p>
<p>" words of a Tory Chief Justice, and they state the truth. The law
</p>
<p>" does every thing for the landlord, and nothing for the tenant."
</p>
<p>Now it was a most monstrous perversion of the law and of the fact,
</p>
<p>to make that statement before the people assembled at that meeting.
</p>
<p>For I have been referred to the case, in which Lord Chief Justice
</p>
<p>Pennefather delivered the judgment alluded to. Your Lordships
</p>
<p>will find it reported in the 5th volume of Law and Equity Reports,
</p>
<p>page 307 ; it is the case of Delap v. Leonard ; the question turned
</p>
<p>758
</p>
<p>on one of the Ejectment Statutes, and it was, whether in the particu-
</p>
<p>lar case there should he a right of entry at common law. Referring
</p>
<p>to that particular Act, his Lordship says: " There are a great variety
</p>
<p>" of Statutes regulating the law of ejectment in this country; and
</p>
<p>" although, no doubt, all are to be considered as one code, yet, I am
</p>
<p>" far from thinking the whole are to be considered as incorporated in
</p>
<p>" the first Statutes passed on the subject. On the contrary, there
</p>
<p>" has been shown by the Legislature, an anxious desire to give an
</p>
<p>" easier remedy to the landlord for the recovery of his rent, and to
</p>
<p>" prevent frauds being committed by the tenants." Then he goes
</p>
<p>into the particular Acts in question, and says: "I look upon the
</p>
<p>" legislation upon this subject as a progressive code, having the be-
</p>
<p>" nefit of the landlord in view, and giving in each successive Act ad-
</p>
<p>" ditional remedies to the landlord, that is, a remedy to recover the
</p>
<p>" land when a year's rent is due ; and this, whether the instrument
</p>
<p>" under which the tenant holds contained a clause of re-entry or
</p>
<p>" not. It was never in the contemplation of the Legislature, that
</p>
<p>" this Statute should not be part of a system of progressive legisla-
</p>
<p>" tion." But his Lordship never meant there to lay down this,
</p>
<p>that the law in Ireland, generally, had not in contemplation the
</p>
<p>tenant at all, but only the interests of the landlord. Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>says, those were the words of the Lord Chief Justice, and they
</p>
<p>state the truth, that the law does everything' for the landlord, and
</p>
<p>nothing for the tenant. In that case the decision was for the tenant.
</p>
<p>I thought it right, this having been publicly read in Court, that the
</p>
<p>public should be disabused of the notion that this high Court had laid
</p>
<p>down such a proposition as that stated by Mr. O'Connell. The law in
</p>
<p>that case was ruled in favour of the tenant, and gave him the benefit
</p>
<p>of the objection. Mr. O'Connell then says, he is ready to consult the
</p>
<p>landlords, and advises them to hasten to join him, or it might be worse
</p>
<p>for them if they delayed.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I stated to you, that the evidence would furnish
</p>
<p>abundant proof of the intention of addressing the army in these pub-
</p>
<p>lications, with a view either to create disaffection amongst them, or

<p>else to persuade the people of this country, that in the event of the
</p>
<p>army being called upon, it would not act against them. See how
</p>
<p>clearly this is demonstrated by the document, to which I am about to
</p>
<p>direct your attention. This publication appears in the Pilot of the 6th
</p>
<p>of September ; it is entitled " The Irish in the English Army." In
</p>
<p>this we have again explained the meaning of " The Morality of War,"
</p>
<p>and " The Duty of a Soldier." This publication has not been com-
</p>
<p>mented on, or alluded to, by any of the counsel on the other side. It
</p>
<p>has, like the rest, been passed over in total silence. [The Solicitor-
</p>
<p>General here read the article, see ante, page 1 19J.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, there is no name signed to this article.
</p>
<p>It does not purport to be a letter of a correspondent ; it purports to be
</p>
<p>an original article in the newspaper. I think after that I need not
</p>
<p>trouble you any further on that part of this case, which relates to the
</p>
<p>object of either seducing the army, or inducing the people of the
</p>
<p>759
</p>
<p>country to believe, that the Irish soldiers, consisting of forty-one
</p>
<p>thousand in number, would never act against them.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, at the meeting of the 4th of September, Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell announced his intention of attending at Loughrea, which he did
</p>
<p>accordingly on the I Oth of September. Mr. Ross has given us a part
</p>
<p>of his speech, in which he says, alluding to the Queen's speech:
</p>
<p>" They had but one arrow in the quiver; but one stone unflung ; but
</p>
<p>" one trick untried ; and out they brought the Queen. All Europe
</p>
<p>" was to be astonished by the splendour of her speech against Ire-
</p>
<p>" land, Oh! what a trick it was ! It was worse than a scolding
</p>
<p>" match between two Gsherwomen in Billingsgate. The Jiskerwoman
</p>
<p>" gives her colleague the power of reply ; and if she calls her by
</p>
<p>" ugly names, she is obliged to wait to hear them retorted ; but the
</p>
<p>" Government had all the scolding on one side. It was an unfair
</p>
<p>" advantage that Judy took of us." I suppose by that was meant the
</p>
<p>Government. I believe Mr. O'Connell was right in saying it did not
</p>
<p>apply to the Queen. I do not mean to say of him that he personally
</p>
<p>imputed anything to the Queen. " When they talked of beating us,
</p>
<p>" we were ready with our shilelaghs. If they will give us fair play
</p>
<p>" here at scolding, I am ready for them. I remember one phrase of
</p>
<p>" that villain, Castlereagh, he talked of a man having his throat cut
</p>
<p>" behind his back. That is what the Ministers have done in the
</p>
<p>'* scolding match. Instead of giving me fair play, and hearing me
</p>
<p>" in reply, they have cut my throat behind my back. Who is afraid
</p>
<p>" of the Queen's speech ? [< No owe.'] No ; but we have cause to
</p>
<p>" rejoice in it. Our enemies would not use such a rotten weapon if
</p>
<p>M they had better. If anything could resist the Repeal it will not be
</p>
<p>" a few paltry words in a respectable lady's mouth." Now, I must
</p>
<p>say, that this seems to me to be language which it is very difficult to
</p>
<p>reconcile with that peculiarly high degree of loyalty to which the mem-
</p>
<p>bers of this Association lay claim. It is not a very respectful way, to
</p>
<p>say the least of it, of alluding to Her Majesty : " What plan can they
</p>
<p>have to resist us?" Then he goes on to say, that " the Irish nation
</p>
<p>demands liberty in a voice of thunder," and uses some language
</p>

</p>
<p>which is metaphorical, and, therefore, I will not lay any stress on it.
</p>
<p>But he proceeds in less equivocal terms : " How many hundred thou-
</p>
<p>" sands did I see to-day to contradict their expectations ? The meet-
</p>
<p>'* ing of to-day was one of the most magnificent and numerous that I
</p>
<p>" have seen. My heart throbbed with delight, and 1 every now and
</p>
<p>" then exclaimed to myself, this is an answer to the Queen's Speech.
</p>
<p>" I read an article in the Times newspaper, which is very angry with
</p>
<p>" me for not taking its advice. It said : ' Does not Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>" * know that the greater part of the multitudes who attend on him
</p>
<p>" ' would be very glad to shrink from danger into security?' I tell
</p>
<p>" the Times newspaper that the reason I call these meetings is, that
</p>
<p>" the people shall not be tempted, not to shrink from, but to go too
</p>
<p>" far; that I call these meetings to revive hope, and to keep it
</p>
<p>" between the people and despair, that would soon drive them on
</p>
<p>" hostile bayonets ; that so far from shrinking from danger, do not
</p>
<p>760
</p>
<p>" hundreds call out to me, ' Sir, when will you let us at them V "
</p>
<p>Here is Mr. O'Connell at Loughrea, admitting- that he is called on
</p>
<p>by hundreds frequently, with the question, " Sir, when will you let
</p>
<p>us beat them ?" and this is responded to, according to the report, by
</p>
<p>cheers. He then says : " These mighty meetings are the safety valve,
</p>
<p>" through which the boiling courage of the soul vents itself into the
</p>
<p>" tranquillity of success." Mr. O'Connell talks of the safety valve?
</p>
<p>Who created the necessity for it  who got up the steam ? He takes
</p>
<p>a merit for calling these meetings, and keeping them peaceable, as a
</p>
<p>safety valve to prevent the agitation, of which he himself is the cause.
</p>
<p>He says : " They allow the fiery spirit to be allayed ; anger and irri-
</p>
<p>" tation pass away, and do not carry men beyond the rules of right and
</p>
<p>" propriety ; they make them hope in each other, and raise in them
</p>
<p>" a higher and diviner hope, that the days of the woes of Ireland
</p>
<p>" will not last for ever. That being virtuous, good tempered, and
</p>
<p>" moral, their triumph is certain, and the defeat of their ene-
</p>
<p>" mies inevitable. I am leading you  pardon the vanity, you have
</p>
<p>" made me vain  in the paths of quiet, and the practical observance
</p>
<p>" of the maxim, that ' he who commits a crime gives strength to the
</p>
<p>" enemy.' That maxim has been the hinge of my political life.
</p>
<p>" Other meetings will take place at Connemara ; this day week at
</p>
<p>" Lismore; on the 8th of October on the Mound at Clontarf erected
</p>
<p>" over the conquered Danes." The scenes selected for those meet-
</p>
<p>ings were to be, as I have already observed, places signalized by some
</p>
<p>event in the Irish history, calculated to keep alive hostility in the
</p>
<p>minds of the Irish against their fellow-subjects. He then announced,
</p>
<p>" lam arranging to have my parliamentary plan complete, in case of
</p>
<p>any accident that might arise." I do not myself profess to under-
</p>
<p>stand that; but, recollect this, that Mr. O'Connell addressed you on
</p>
<p>his own behalf for a day, that he was the person who used this lan-
</p>
<p>guage, that he never adverted to any of these passages which I have
</p>
<p>been recalling to your recollection, and never condescended to ex-
</p>
<p>plain to you, or to the Public, what he meant to convey by these
</p>
<p>passages, in these speeches, to the multitudinous thousands of the

</p>
<p>people around him. He declaimed at great length on the mischiefs
</p>
<p>of the Union, and went into a long statistical detail, comparing the
</p>
<p>state of Ireland before and after that measure, which had nothing
</p>
<p>whatever to do, as my friend, Mr. Henn, justly observed, with the
</p>
<p>merits of the case. To that he chose to confine himself, and made a
</p>
<p>Repeal speech, but he never did pretend to qualify or explain any
</p>
<p>one single sentence in any of those harangues which he has been
</p>
<p>proved to have delivered. You have, to be sure, plenty of references
</p>
<p>to his speeches prior to the year 1843. Now he goes on: " Who
</p>
<p>can calculate how soon we may have a Parliament ?" He then
</p>
<p>uses an expression which may furnish something like an inkling of
</p>
<p>what was in his mind : " Let England be involved in any awkward
</p>
<p>" predicament with one state of Europe  let any country on the face
</p>
<p>" of the earth attack her, and in twenty-four hours we shall have
</p>
<p>" our own Parliament."
</p>
<p>761
</p>
<p>Up to this time something like an appearance of constitutional
</p>
<p>proceeding- was preserved. These multitudinous meetings, though
</p>
<p>really called for the purposes which we charge, were masked, or jus-
</p>
<p>tified, or excused, under the pretext that there was an intention to
</p>
<p>petition Parliament, and that this was a mode of collecting the voice
</p>
<p>of the people of Ireland in favour of the Repeal of the Union.
</p>
<p>But I now come to an era in the history of this Association, at
</p>
<p>which, I think, the disguise was thrown off altogether. On the 13th
</p>
<p>of September, a meeting took place at the Association, at which Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell expresses himself to tins effect  alluding to an address
</p>
<p>which had been prepared, and which it was afterwards moved should
</p>
<p>be circulated both in Ireland, in England, and in the Colonies. He
</p>
<p>says : " I will read the address, and move that it be printed on a
</p>
<p>" broad sheet, and posted in the large towns of the empire. London,
</p>
<p>" Bath, Bristol, and bigotted Liverpool shall be placarded with it.
</p>
<p>" We will send copies of it to the British Colonies, and have them
</p>
<p>'* placarded wherever the British Crown has power. It is our
</p>
<p>M proclamation ; it is no haughty declaration of independence. It
</p>
<p>" is a description of grievances, for which we insist on redress. It
</p>
<p>" is putting an end to all compromise. To be sure, if the English
</p>
<p>" Government had the good sense to-morrow to do all that we want
</p>
<p>" it might take away from me some unwilling Repealers." It ap-
</p>
<p>pears there are unwilling Repealers. " But it would not take the
</p>
<p>" people from me, who know, by experience, that we never trusted
</p>
<p>" England that we were not deceived, and who are now too saga-
</p>
<p>" cious, as well as strong, to be mocked or deluded by any other
</p>
<p>" measure offered to them, except the one measure they look for,
</p>
<p>" the Repeal of the Legislative Union." He then read the address,
</p>
<p>and moved its adoption. In other words, this is saying: " no matter
</p>
<p>" what we petition for, no matter what we say we want, no matter
</p>
<p>" how willing the Legislature may be to comply with our wishes  if
</p>
<p>" they give us all we want, even that will not do ; it may detach from
</p>
<p>" my ranks some unwilling Repealers, but it will not separate from
</p>
<p>" me the great body of these Irish people, who will never again trust

</p>
<p>" the English, because they never confided in them but they were
</p>
<p>" betrayed." This, I repeat, is throwing off the mask. Even the
</p>
<p>pretext of pursuing the Repeal of the Union in a legal and constitu-
</p>
<p>tional way, through the medium of Parliament, is abandoned. We
</p>
<p>have here a distinct announcement to the world, that this is no longer
</p>
<p>the object, and that nothing but independence will suffice.
</p>
<p>This document is headed " Loyal National Repeal Association.
</p>
<p>To the Inhabitants of the Countries subject to the British Crown."
</p>
<p>Here is the go-by given to Parliament altogether ; here is an address
</p>
<p>to all the subjects of Her Majesty  of the British Crown  all over
</p>
<p>the world. " Fellow-subjects. The people of Ireland would anxiously
</p>
<p>" desire your sympathy and support. But long and painful expe-
</p>
<p>" rience has taught them not to expect either the one or the other.
</p>
<p>" Confident, however, in their own exertions, they content them-
</p>
<p>" selves with laying before you a simple statement of some of the
</p>
<p>5E
</p>
<p>762
</p>
<p>u grievances under which their country labours ; yet have no other
</p>
<p>" hope, as far as you are concerned, than that of vindicating them-
</p>
<p>*' selves in the eyes of all rational and just men amongst you, for the
</p>
<p>i( magnitude of the struggle they are now making in the cause of their
</p>
<p>" country. There is no truth more undeniable than this, that Eng-
</p>
<p>" land has inflicted more grievous calamities upon Ireland than any
</p>
<p>" country on the face of the earth besides has done upon any other."
</p>
<p>This single sentence, being the expressed will and opinion of this
</p>
<p>body, would, in itself, be decisive to prove their object to be, to
</p>
<p>create in the minds of the Irish people that feeling of hostility
</p>
<p>towards the English, which must necessarily arise from their convic-
</p>
<p>tion that the sole object of England, from first to last, has been to
</p>
<p>oppress and ruin them. Attend to what follows : " In the history of
</p>
<p>" mankind there is nothing to be compared with the atrocity of
</p>
<p>" the crimes which England has perpetrated on the Irish people,
</p>
<p>" nor as yet has the spirit which created and animated such
</p>
<p>" crimes been much mitigated, if mitigated at all from its ori-
</p>
<p>" ginal virulence." That is, the same feelings which centuries ago
</p>
<p>dictated all the oppressions and all the wrongs which England has
</p>
<p>inflicted on this country, subsists at the present moment in an un-
</p>
<p>mitigated degree. Then follows a long detail of what you have re-
</p>
<p>peatedly heard, during this trial, of those grievances about the repre-
</p>
<p>sentation, about the Union, about absenteeism, and other such mat-
</p>
<p>ters ; and then, there is this passage to which I must particularly
</p>
<p>refer : " Eighthly.  Deep-rooted and increasing discontent pervades
</p>
<p>" the entire nation. Feelings of estrangement are rapidly sup-
</p>
<p>" planting those affections which kindness and justice could have
</p>
<p>" placed at the command of Government. Despairing of redress
</p>
<p>" from the Legislature, the people of Ireland, confining themselves
</p>
<p>" to legal and constitutional means, now rely upon their own strength
</p>
<p>" and resolution for the attainment of those rights which they have
</p>
<p>" sought from the British Parliament in vain. They know full well
</p>
<p>" that they can obtain adequate redress from a domestic Legislature
</p>
<p>" alone." " Ninthly  The voice of the civilized world lays to the

</p>
<p>" charge of the English Government the guilt of having produced
</p>
<p>" this exasperation of national feeling." There is a black catalogue
</p>
<p>of grievances against England, and then there is a distinct announce-
</p>
<p>ment that they mean to rely on themselves for the accomplishment
</p>
<p>of the object : " Fellow subjects ! our case is before you and before
</p>
<p>" the world. Grievances, such as the Irish people endure, no other
</p>
<p>" country has ever suffered. Insults, such as are offered to us, were
</p>
<p>" never inflicted on any other. There is one consolation : it is ad-
</p>
<p>" mitted by all, and is as clear as the noon-day sun, that unless we
</p>
<p>" redress ourselves, we can have no succour from any other quarter ;
</p>
<p>" but we suffice for ourselves and our country  we suffice fob the
</p>
<p>" Repkal. We expect nothing from England or Englishmen  from
</p>
<p>" Scotland or Scotchmen. In each of those countries the benevo-
</p>
<p>" lent few are overpowered by the anti-national antipathy to Ireland,
</p>
<p>" and the virulent bigotry against the Catholic religion of the over-
</p>
<p>" whelming majority of both England and Scotland. The present
</p>
<p>763
</p>
<p>" Parliament has been packed, with the aid of the most flagitious
</p>
<p>" bribery, to oppress and crush the Irish nation. From them there
</p>
<p>" is neither redress, nor even hope. But, Irishmen, we suffice for
</p>
<p>" ourselves. Stand together, continue together, in peaceful conduct,
</p>
<p>" in loyal attachment to the throne, in constitutional exertion, and in
</p>
<p>" none other. Stand together and persevere, and Ireland shall have
</p>
<p>" her Parliament again. Such are the words we address to our fel-
</p>
<p>" low-subjects all over the globe. Signed by order, Daniel O'Con-
</p>
<p>" nell." You will recollect that we produced a witness who proved,
</p>
<p>that this document, and several copies of it, were actually posted or
</p>
<p>placarded in Liverpool, and he took down that which was offered in
</p>
<p>evidence. I do not know whether it was this one which I have
</p>
<p>read, which was placarded in the streets of Liverpool. The address
</p>
<p>was moved by Mr. O'Connell at the Association on the 13th Sep-
</p>
<p>tember, and adopted as the act of that body.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I come next to a meeting at Clifden, on the 17th of
</p>
<p>September. I shall not detain you at length on each of these meet-
</p>
<p>ings ; I shall be as brief as I possibly can after the very great tres-
</p>
<p>pass I have already made on your patience. But I think you will
</p>
<p>find, as these meetings progress, the language used at each is less equi-
</p>
<p>vocal. Mr. Dillon Browne attended the meeting at Clifden, Conne-
</p>
<p>mara. I will read Mr. O'Connell's speech from Mr. Ross's note.
</p>
<p>" He was, he said, equally delighted with his friend Mr. Dillon
</p>
<p>" Browne, with the perfect order and steadiness with which the
</p>
<p>" mountain cavalry"  this is the first time we have got the word
</p>
<p>" cavalry" in these harangues  " had filed to the rear on that day at
</p>
<p>" the bidding of his friend Tom Steele ; little business the cavalry of
</p>
<p>" England would have in following them over the mountains." Now,
</p>
<p>what was the meaning of that ? You, the people of Connemara, are
</p>
<p>in a country where it would be impossible for military to act against
</p>
<p>you ; they could not follow you into the mountains. " Had they
</p>
<p>" not," he then asked, " ready arms to assist him if it became neces-
</p>
<p>" sary ; but it would not be necessary, as the Government knew they
</p>
<p>" had as well as he ; but would their enemies attack them  for he

</p>
<p>" then dared them there to the attack ? Ah ! they would not, for
</p>
<p>" they feared to do so. He was there surrounded by many a brave
</p>
<p>" and stout Irishman, by men who knew not what fear was, and who
</p>
<p>" were ready for him if it became necessary." Language more un-
</p>
<p>disguised certainly could not be used. " If their grievances were not
</p>
<p>" immediately redressed, and that they were attacked, all he would
</p>
<p>" then say was, wo to them who would attack them, as it would be
</p>
<p>" then  war to the knife. Therefore, if the Government were wise,
</p>
<p>" they would come into terms with him ; and the only way to do that
</p>
<p>" would be to give them a Repeal of the Union." If they were wise,
</p>
<p>they would come to terms with them. I think that is pretty "minacious,"
</p>
<p>as one of the counsel on the other side expressed it. At the banquet at
</p>
<p>Clifden Mr. O'Connell again said, ** that he felt great admiration at the
</p>
<p>" readiness as well as the steadiness with which the Connemara cavalry
</p>
<p>" had formed themselves in military array on that day." If this had been
</p>
<p>our language, interpreting what Mr. O'Connell said, there would have
</p>
<p>764
</p>
<p>been a great outcry ; but I am using Mr. O'Connell's own words :
</p>
<p>" The Connemara cavalry had formed themselves in military array on
</p>
<p>" that day. He then said that he was about to establish Arbitration
</p>
<p>" Courts, and added, that he would take all power out of the hands of
</p>
<p>" Government as regarded the Courts of law."
</p>
<p>I heard it thrown out, amongst other things, that the object was
</p>
<p>merely to prevent the people going to Petty Sessions Courts, and to sub-
</p>
<p>stitute the Arbitrators for the dismissed Magistrates. But here Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell expressly tells the people in so many words, that he hopes,
</p>
<p>by the machinery of these Arbitration Courts, "to take all power out
</p>
<p>of the hands of the Government as regarded the Courts of law." It was
</p>
<p>as if he had said this : " I myself, or my associates, mean to take upon
</p>
<p>"us the government of this country; we will take, amongst other
</p>
<p>" things, into our hands the administration of the law ; we will take
</p>
<p>** all power out of the hands of the Government, as regards the
</p>
<p>" Courts of law ; and I now announce to you, for that purpose,
</p>
<p>" and with that view, we are instituting Arbitration Courts."
</p>
<p>Why, I am calling upon you, in this case, to act upon the con-
</p>
<p>fession and admission of the parties themselves ; it does appear
</p>
<p>to my humble judgment to come to that. What earthly ob-
</p>
<p>ject can you suppose the institution of these Courts of Arbitration
</p>
<p>had, except that which Mr. O'Connell avowed in the presence of
</p>
<p>thousands of people that it had? " For he would give the people
</p>
<p>cheap and impartial justice." He then proceeded to say, that " he
</p>
<p>" had by that time demonstrated to England that more men of an
</p>
<p>" adult age  why should he hesitate to say it?  that more men of a
</p>
<p>" fighting age, than had ever made a declaration for any other
</p>
<p>" country in the world, had met together in Ireland to denounce the
</p>
<p>" abominable and nefarious Union, and yet they had been all quiet.
</p>
<p>" Their enemies had, however, threatened them, but he would then
</p>
<p>" say to them, let them come on, if they dare, and attack us." The
</p>
<p>note here says : " The cheers here were vociferous in the extreme?
</p>
<p>" Now I will make my experiment on them ; I want to know whether
</p>
<p>" you are not as brave and as Irish as the rest of the nation ? I want

</p>
<p>" to know whether you are not as honest, as true, as faithful, as the
</p>
<p>" rest of your countrymen ? I want to know whether you don't hate
</p>
<p>" Saxon tyranny as much as the natives of other parts of Ireland ? I
</p>
<p>" want to know whether you do not feel the evils of misgovernment
</p>
<p>" as much as the people of any other part of Ireland ?" He then
</p>
<p>says : " You have no commerce, and where are your manufactures ?
</p>
<p>" Oh ! you have no manufactures. Why ? Because Ireland is go-
</p>
<p>" verned by Saxons, and not by Irishmen. Will you join me in
</p>
<p>" giving Ireland to the Irish ?" He then says : " If it were necessary
</p>
<p>" for me to call out your force in battle, I am sure there is not a man
</p>
<p>" of you who would not come again on the day I asked him." Now
</p>
<p>here is Mr. O'Connell's exposition of " coming again on the day he
</p>
<p>asked :" " If it were necessary for me to call out your force in battle,
</p>
<p>" I am sure there is not a man of you who would not come again on
</p>
<p>" the day I asked him. [< We will.' J I know it, and I will tell you why
</p>
<p>"it is unnecessary  because your enemies know it as well as I do.
</p>
<p>765
</p>
<p>" The enemy has but one resource, the British Ministry has but one
</p>
<p>" resource left ; they think you will be tired of looking for freedom ;
</p>
<p>" you will when you have the Parliament in College-green, and not a
</p>
<p>" moment sooner. They might as well standby the stream, in expec-
</p>
<p>" tation of seeing the last of its waters run by, as imagine that the
</p>
<p>" people of Ireland will be tired of looking for liberty. What I
</p>
<p>" propose are not imaginary benefits; they are real ones. I would
</p>
<p>" make your streams turn the wheels of busy manufactories, and your
</p>
<p>" noble harbours the refuge for the shipping of the Western world.
</p>
<p>" Yours are the nearest ports to America, and are better suited for
</p>
<p>" commerce than those of any other district ; but you have no com-
</p>
<p>" merce because you have no genial Government." Then he says :
</p>
<p>" I caution you that any man who commits a crime will strengthen
</p>
<p>the enemy. Force and violence are not to be used." Observe now :
</p>
<p>u If the time for using them should come, there is one here will tell
</p>
<p>you that the time has come. [' We will follow you.']" He then
</p>
<p>says : " I have more cavalry than at any former meeting. Handy
</p>
<p>" hacks they are too. Dillon Browne spoke of the English heavy
</p>
<p>" cavalry following them through the mountains ; I believe they
</p>
<p>" would be going away from them, rather than following them."
</p>
<p>He says: " I have demonstrated that I have more men, more
</p>
<p>" men of a fighting age  why should I not use that word ?  ready to
</p>
<p>" stand by their country, than ever evinced that determination before.
</p>
<p>" I say to England, we will use no violence, we will make no attack,
</p>
<p>" we will reserve our force for defence, but attack us if you dare.
</p>
<p>" What is the answer ? We do not intend to attack you, and you
</p>
<p>14 need not set us at defiance. My reply is the schoolboy's, 4 thank
</p>
<p>44 you for nothing says the gallipot.' But then they say, how can you
</p>
<p>' carry Repeal ? If you take a single additional step, we will go to
</p>
<p>44 law with you. My answer is, that I am an old lawyer, and the pro-
</p>
<p>44 verb says, you cannot catch old birds with chaff, and they are not
</p>
<p>44 able to beat an old lawyer with chaff at all events. 1 set your chaff
</p>
<p>44 at defiance, and will take the next step in spite of you. We are
</p>
<p>44 appointing men to act as Arbitrators in the room of the Magistrates

<p>" who were struck off, and those who are left in the commission, who
</p>
<p>44 are infinitely worse. Last year, the duty was taken off arbitral ions.
</p>
<p>44 The Courts will sit on every Friday afterwards. They will spread
</p>
<p>" through the country. We have had a number of applications for
</p>
<p>" the establishment of Courts in various parts of Ireland, and I am
</p>
<p>44 convinced that it will work well." Then he says : " Disputes which
</p>
<p>" now fester and rankle in a village will be settled amicably. It will
</p>
<p>44 spread further ; I will apply the principle to a higher class of cases.
</p>
<p>" We will appoint Arbitrators for everything the people may choose,
</p>
<p>44 and I trust before I am twelve months older, to take half the busi-
</p>
<p>" ness out of the superior Courts. This is laying the basis of a judi-
</p>
<p>" cial system, and above all, it is safe. I defy all the Crown lawyers
</p>
<p>44 to find a flaw in the plan." There again he throws off all disguise,
</p>
<p>and tells you in so many words, what his course is. Now comes ano-
</p>
<p>ther part of his plan : " We are to have an Association which is to
</p>
<p>766
</p>
<p>meet by chance in Dublin, I hope before this year closes." That
</p>
<p>is, the year 1843. " But at all events, I am sure early in the next,
</p>
<p>" three hundred gentlemen will find themselves together in Dublin,
</p>
<p>" by one accident or another. The newspapers have described how
</p>
<p>" this is to be done. I never take advice from newspapers in matters
</p>
<p>" of law ; I am glad to take facts from newspapers, and I am happy to
</p>
<p>" say that no country in Europe has a more honest and powerful
</p>
<p>" Press than we have in Ireland. One thing that shows we are in the
</p>
<p>" right road is the amount of talent possessed by the liberal Press.
</p>
<p>" But I will not take my law from them. Without going into the
</p>
<p>" Convention Act, or any other Act, I say, at the time I have stated,
</p>
<p>" we shall have three hundred gentlemen assembled, ready to enter
</p>
<p>" into immediate negotiation with the British minister." Negotia-
</p>
<p>tion ! Observe now, what the negotiation is to be: " To show him
</p>
<p>" the state of Ireland ; to show him our further resources ; to show
</p>
<p>" how we could paralyze the entire state, and that it would be done
</p>
<p>" by nothing but sowing more potatoes, and leaving the harvest to rot
</p>
<p>" on the field, except the poor man's part  the potatoes ; to show him
</p>
<p>" that we have physical power, and that, if assailed, we will use it."
</p>
<p>Such were the peaceful, legal, and constitutional means by which this
</p>
<p>consummation was to be achieved. The three hundred gentlemen,
</p>
<p>who, perhaps, but that these proceedings had been arrested or stopped,
</p>
<p>might have been now assembled, were to enter into negotiations with
</p>
<p>the British Minister, and transmit to him an intimation that if he did
</p>
<p>not at once accede to the demands of the Loyal National Repeal As-
</p>
<p>sociation, by repealing the Union, the harvest would be suffered to rot
</p>
<p>on the ground, the State would be paralyzed, the physical power of the
</p>
<p>country called out, and if any attempt was made to put them down, they
</p>
<p>would use that physical force for the purpose of resisting any such at-
</p>
<p>" tempt. I have more projects in my mind, but I will not speak of them
</p>
<p>" now, by which I can checkmate the Government tranquilly and
</p>
<p>" quietly. It is avowed that proud England dare not assume an
</p>
<p>" attitude of menace towards any state in the world, however insig-
</p>
<p>" nificant. The English Government can no longer threaten. Alas!

</p>
<p>" it cannot exert itself in necessary defence. It is weak, because it
</p>
<p>" has withered the strong arm of Irish affection. They have not
</p>
<p>" conciliated Ireland, because they offered nothing as a remedy for our
</p>
<p><l grievances, but a miserable paltry compromise, giving what chili
</p>
<p>" dren call the smallest half  and what have we replied? We have
</p>
<p>" said that there shall be no compromise. Repeal, nothing but
</p>
<p>' Repeal." Now, observe the passage I am now going to read ; this
</p>
<p>is the 17th of September : " For the present year my monster meet-
</p>
<p>"< ings are nearly over ; there will not be above seven or eight more
</p>
<p>< of them ; but before I have done with them the demonstration of
</p>
<p> moral combination, and of the mighty giant power of the people of
</p>
<p>" Ireland will be complete  their discipline will be complete. Why,
</p>
<p>** you saw how the cavalry fell in and took their station, five by five,
</p>
<p>** at the word of command of Tom Steele. No aide-de-camp of the
</p>
<p> Lord Lieutenant was ever obeyed so cheerfully as he was." I think
</p>
<p>767
</p>
<p>that is tolerably significant of an appeal to physical force  sufficiently
</p>
<p>free from ambiguity or difficulty in its meaning.
</p>
<p>The next meeting that took place, was at Mullaghmast, which
</p>
<p>was a very important one. In the interval between the meeting of
</p>
<p>Clifden, the importance of which I have not overrated, and that at
</p>
<p>Mullaghmast, there appeared a publication in the Pilot of the 25th of
</p>
<p>September. The question at issue between us and the traversers,
</p>
<p>you will recollect, is this : they say, they never meant to do anything
</p>
<p>but to make a demonstration of moral force, and national will.
</p>
<p>" No," say we, " you did mean to make a demonstration of physical
</p>
<p>force." Have I, so far as I have gone, supported our allegation, and
</p>
<p>negatived their's ? Just at the time that the avowal is made by Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell, at Clifden, of the military organization of the people,
</p>
<p>appears the publication, to which I have alluded, in the Pilot, called
</p>
<p>" The Army, the People, and the Government." It is published on
</p>
<p>the 25th of September, 1843, in Mr. Barrett's paper. After stating
</p>
<p>that the army is the people's army, because they are paid by the
</p>
<p>people, and because their ranks are supplied from the people, the
</p>
<p>article goes on : " A system precisely similar to this"  that is, the
</p>
<p>present system of promotion in the army, " prevailed in France, pre-
</p>
<p>" vious to what is called the Revolution  that is, a change by which
</p>
<p>" the people were enabled to divide the land amongst each other
</p>
<p>"like brothers." That is Mr. Barrett's definition of a revolution.
</p>
<p>A revolution is " a change by which the people are enabled to divide
</p>
<p>the land amongst each other like brothers." Well, he then says :
</p>
<p>u Prior to the French Revolution, no man, however brave or well-
</p>
<p>" conducted, could procure any rank above the hopeless position of
</p>
<p>" a private or sergeant, except he belonged to the dronish and un-
</p>
<p>" productive classes, calling themselves nobles, but of which we
</p>
<p>"can convey a better idea by the word 'idlers.' How long
</p>
<p>" this state of things is likely to continue in these countries, we
</p>
<p>" do not know." The allusion to these sergeants being promoted
</p>
<p>to be commissioned officers, was made at former meetings. " How
</p>
<p>" long this state of things is likely to continue in these countries

</p>
<p>tl we do not know ; but we think we see what Talleyrand called
</p>
<p>" ' a beginning of the end.' ' Every dog has his day,' and God
</p>
<p>'* knows ! the poor sergeants and privates deserve their days. Why
</p>
<p>" not adopt the system of rising from the ranks, which the people
</p>
<p>[in italics] adopted in France, when maddened by oppression,
</p>
<p>" they rose up, and knocked their tyrants on their heads ? Of course,
</p>
<p>" we, the moral instructors of the Irish people, do not recommend
</p>
<p>" the system of rising up and knocking on the head, which the French
</p>
<p>" were compelled to adopt. Far from it. We are the old friends
</p>
<p>K of peaceable agitation. The Liberator has said,  he who commits
</p>
<p>" a crime gives strength to the enemy ;' and, we believe, it is quite
</p>
<p>" sufficient reason for the Irish not to commit a crime, when we tell
</p>
<p>" them that enemy is England." That is the secret motive of the
</p>
<p>maxim, " He who commits a crime gives strength to the enemy."
</p>
<p>That is the exposition of the precept, for the morality of which so
</p>
<p>much credit is taken. He then goes on to say : " We are pretty sure,
</p>
<p>768
</p>
<p>" they are not inclined to strengthen her at any rate. But, to come
</p>
<p>" to the point  the state of the army  what the devil are those per-
</p>
<p>u sons in command about? Are they blind? Are they mad ? Will
</p>
<p>" they be warned by us, whom they know well to be their friend ?
</p>
<p>" for, if our columns were not open to the poor soldier, and if our
</p>
<p>' pen was not used as a peace-preserver, we really believe there would
</p>
<p>" have been a mutiny long since." Very kind of him to interfere
</p>
<p>certainly. " Yes, persecute the soldier to the utmost, over-drill him
</p>
<p>* in the dog dags, withhold his furlough, deprive him of his news-
</p>
<p>" paper, confine him for the slightest fault, march him to the house
</p>
<p>" of God armed and accoutred, as if for battle ; but leave him the
</p>
<p>" Press open, and he has still some hope /" He then goes on to
</p>
<p>the matter of the 5th Fusileers, which I shall not trouble you by
</p>
<p>repeating, and he says : " Thus, the country appears to have never
</p>
<p>" been so safe, as when the people and the army are on the best
</p>
<p>" terms ! This is exactly what a popular government would desire.
</p>
<p>" But certain spy-employing monsters would seem to wish to ' tamper
</p>
<p>" with the army,' and to instigate it to fall on the unoffending
</p>
<p>" people  men, women, and children. But those untried and unim-
</p>
<p>" peached villains would do well to first consider the feelings of the
</p>
<p>" army. An army has often proved a two-edged weapon, which is
</p>
<p>" liable to wound the hand that wields it. Thank God ! we have,
</p>
<p>" however, lived to see the army morally reformed, as far as the
</p>
<p>" soldiers are concerned. We, therefore, would wish to see promo-
</p>
<p>" tion from the ranks general, and flogging, or back-mangling, totally
</p>
<p>" abolished ! Let a soldier be shot, but not flogged. The soldiers
</p>
<p>" are now as decent, sober, orderly a body of men as any in society.
</p>
<p>" They are patient, too, and, Heaven knows! they require to be so.
</p>
<p>" Many of them are teetotallers. They mind their religion, and if
</p>
<p>u not prevented by their money-promoted commanders, would im-
</p>
<p>" prove their minds by reading the newspapers, which we think, after
</p>
<p>" fulfilling their duties (including over-drilling), that they have just
</p>
<p>u as much right to do as those parties called officers fur an officer
</p>
<p>* ought properly to mean a promoted soldier, and a soldier an

<p>" unpromoted officer. While we are on this important subject,
</p>
<p>" we feel it to be our duty to again direct the people, and the per-
</p>
<p>" sons who temporarily occupy the places of profit called Govern-
</p>
<p>" ment, to the admirable military letters of John Cornelius O'Cal-
</p>
<p>" laghan, author of ' The Green Book.' These letters settle for
</p>
<p>" ever the question of the army, that source of England's weakness."
</p>
<p>You will recollect that those letters (as a former publication stated)
</p>
<p>declare the fact, that of thesoldiersin the British army, forty-one thou-
</p>
<p>sand were Irishmen. That is what Mr. Barrett means by this allusion.
</p>
<p>" These letters first 'let the cat out of the bag.' They teach the
</p>
<p>" soldier his importance ; showing him that he is an accountable
</p>
<p>" being, not what certain traitors would make him, an uncondition-
</p>
<p>" al murderer. They teach Ireland her strength, and also teach
</p>
<p>" England her's, which the whole world now admits to consist of
</p>
<p>" Irish soldiers and sailors. ' Ireland is England's right arm.' So say
</p>
<p>" the English themselves, and 'so say we all of us.' Take away the
</p>
<p>7G9
</p>
<p>" 'right arm,' and what a way she'd be in,  what a figure she'd cut.'
</p>
<p>" With O'Callaghatfs Letters in one hand, and his ' Green Book'
</p>
<p>" in the other, we set at defiance the conspirators who would DARE
</p>
<p>" talk of warring against the Irish nation, the best and most loyal sub-
</p>
<p>" jects the Queen has. To the patriotic author an eternal debt of grati-
</p>
<p>" tude is due by his countrymen. lie first directed the public attention
</p>
<p>" to the army, showing up its component parts, and revealing the
</p>
<p>" astounding fact of forty-two thousand Paddies serving in the pay of
</p>
<p>" England." You see here the regularly concerted system and plan
</p>
<p>to represent that there was in the army a number of irishmen, who
</p>
<p>might, by their own countrymen, be calculated on as neutral, and, at
</p>
<p>the same time, to weaken the allegiance of the army itself, or at least
</p>
<p>that portion of it which consisted of Irishmen.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, in the same paper appeared another article, the ten-
</p>
<p>dency of which is quite unequivocal and plain. It points, as it appears
</p>
<p>to me, most distinctly to something like a military movement, for it
</p>
<p>refers to the death of General Jackson, a report of which had re-
</p>
<p>cently before arrived. Commenting on that fact, it makes certain al-
</p>
<p>lusions to the then state of things in Ireland, to which I shall pre-
</p>
<p>sently refer, and which, in my judgment, admit of but one interpre-
</p>
<p>tation. After stating the rumour, Mr. Barrett says : " Who was

<p>Jackson ? Was he an American or a Saxon ?" We never hear the
</p>
<p>word " Englishman ;" it is alsvays " Saxon." " No ; he was one of
</p>
<p>the fiery-eyed Celts." He then gives a particular account of New
</p>
<p>Orleans, and the defeat of the British troops, in the sally headed by
</p>
<p>General Jackson on that occasion, and he says the English were
</p>
<p>driven back to their ships on the coast. He then goes on : " Before
</p>
<p>" we proceed to deal with the latter branch of the subject, we cannot
</p>
<p>" help remarking again, by way of warning to those who threaten us
</p>
<p>" with aggression, that Jackson was only a lawyer. O^Connelt is one
</p>
<p>" too." Can that have any other meaning than this, that Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell had engaged to put himself at the head of any movement which
</p>
<p>might become necessary, and that he might be successful in such a
</p>
<p>movement, notwithstanding he was a lawyer, for that Jackson, who

<p>was at the siege of New Orleans, was no more than a lawyer also.
</p>
<p>" The former surprised the British by attacking them twice in the
</p>
<p>u night. So might the latter, were he driven to it  especially as
</p>
<p>" darkness equalizes undisciplined with disciplined men, throwing the
</p>
<p>"advantage, if any, in favour of the former  the pike being, from
</p>
<p>" the distinctive peculiarity of its shape, the weapon best adapted for
</p>
<p>" night.'' I suppose it will be said that " the pike" is necessary for
</p>
<p>the purpose of making a demonstration of the " moral feeling" of the
</p>
<p>country. He then alludes to the age of General Jackson, and com-
</p>
<p>pares it with that of Mr. O'Connell. The upshot of the whole
</p>
<p>article is this, that there is a leader ready, who, like General Jackson,
</p>
<p>might successfully repel the attacks of British invasion.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  Hand (hat up to me.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor- General.  Yes, my Lord, the two articles are
</p>
<p>there.
</p>
<p>We now come, Gentlemen, to the meeting at Mullaghmast.

</p>
<p>Certainly a very important one in the history of these proceedings.
</p>
<p>This meeting was advertised hy hand-hills or placards, printed, ob-
</p>
<p>serve, at the expense of the Association. This Mullaghmast meeting
</p>
<p>was intended to be a gathering of the Leinster people, and a demon-
</p>
<p>stration by them in favour of Repeal. The placard is entitled :
</p>
<p>" Leinster for Repeal.  Men of Leinster to Mullaghmast.  The
</p>
<p>" Province will declare for Repeal on the Rath of Mullaghmast, on
</p>
<p>" Sunday, the 1st of October. The Corporations of the Province
</p>
<p>u will attend. After the meeting the Liberator will be entertained
</p>
<p>" at a banquet on the Rath. The line of procession will go through
</p>
<p>" Kilcullen, Colvertstown, and the long avenue to Mullaghmast. The
</p>
<p>" bands and horsemen to muster at Kilcullen. Once more, men of
</p>
<p>" Leinster, remember Mullaghmast." It is perfectly clear, from this
</p>
<p>document, that this meeting was convened or got up by the leaders
</p>
<p>of the Association ; and that it was intended to be what is called a
</p>
<p>demonstration of the Province in favour of Repeal. A person of the
</p>
<p>name of Healy was examined as a witness, and he proved that he at-
</p>
<p>tended that meeting, and that papers were circulated and sold for a
</p>
<p>penny, of which he got one. This he produced ; and I think it is
</p>
<p>necessary for me to request your attention to it. You recollect what
</p>
<p>a struggle was made to exclude this piece of evidence, and very fairly
</p>
<p>and properly made, by the counsel for the traversers. Strong ob-
</p>
<p>servations have been made as to our not having proved that this do-
</p>
<p>cument emanated from the Association, in the same manner as we
</p>
<p>proved the publication of the books, pamphlets, and hand-bills. I
</p>
<p>think it right, in answer to that, to observe, that our object in prov-
</p>
<p>ing this was to show, not so much that it was concocted at the Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation, as that it was circulated at that meeting which the Association
</p>
<p>called together. Coupling what appears in it with the professed ob-
</p>
<p>ject of the Association, you will have no doubt that the feeling that
</p>
<p>was intended to be excited in the minds of the multitudes assembled
</p>
<p>on that occasion, was what we charge  a feeling of bitter hostility
</p>
<p>against their fellow-subjects in England. I shall have occasion before
</p>
<p>I have done with this meeting to show, out of the mouth of Mr.

</p>
<p>O'Connell himself, that that was the object ; but I am merely now
</p>
<p>rescuing ourselves from the imputation of attempting to fasten upon
</p>
<p>the Association what we have not proved to be issued by them, in
</p>
<p>the same manner as we have proved the other documents. You will
</p>
<p>see, by-and-by, that is altogether immaterial. This statement pur-
</p>
<p>ports to be : " The full and true Account of the dreadful Slaughter
</p>
<p>" and Murder The fate of those murdered martyrs is calculated to
</p>
<p>" brace the sinews, and rouse in the mind of every Irishman a spirit
</p>
<p>" of desperation ; their blood cries yet to Heaven for vengeance. The
</p>
<p>" day may not, we trust will not, come  brought about as it must be
</p>
<p>" by British aggression, when that cry will be heard ; hut, if it should,
</p>
<p>" woe be to the conquered." This is not the production of a ballad-
</p>
<p>singer, or a person who composes for ballad singers, who go about to
</p>
<p>fairs and sell ballads. This is the language of a far superior class.
</p>
<p>" But if it should, woe be to the conquered." " That our readers
</p>
<p>" may know beforehand, the circumstances under which that black
</p>
<p>771
</p>
<p>" deed in the annals of British crime, the slaughter at Mullaghmast,
</p>
<p>" was perpetrated, we publish the following account of it, extracted
</p>
<p>" from Taafft's History of Ireland. His account may give some,
</p>
<p>" perhaps, a higher gusto for attending the meeting." The recital of
</p>
<p>this massacre may increase the anxiety or the taste of certain persons
</p>
<p>to attend the meeting. Then the document goes on, and quotes an
</p>
<p>extract from Taaffv, to this effect, that there was a treacherous invi-
</p>
<p>tation to a number of chiefs, and that they were all massacred sud-
</p>
<p>denly, without the slightest preparation. Then, in the sequel, it
</p>
<p>says : " The army, thus glutted with the noble blood of the magna-
</p>
<p>" nimous, the pious, the hospitable, the brave, were let loose like
</p>
<p>" bloodhounds on the multitude dispersed in their villages, now vvith-
</p>
<p>" out council, union, or leader; a miserable massacre was made of
</p>
<p>" those unhappy people over the whole extent of what is now called
</p>
<p>" the King and Queen's Counties, without regarding either age or
</p>
<p>" sex. The detail of the diabolical outrages committed in those
</p>
<p>" large and populous districts would make hell blush to be outdone
</p>
<p>" by devils in human shape. I leave the reader to surmise the scenes
</p>
<p>" of horror that ensued when the whole population of an extensive
</p>
<p>" territory was consigned to military execution. A few brave men,
</p>
<p>" here and there, sold their lives as dearly as they could. What
</p>
<p>" conflagration of villages and unfortunate victims rushing from the
</p>
<p>" flames on the spears of their murderers ! What shrieks and lamen-
</p>
<p>" tations of women and children ! A brutal soldiery, drunk with
</p>
<p>" blood and the contents of the cellar, raging with fire and sword
</p>
<p>" through the country, cutting down men, women, and children, with.
</p>
<p>" indiscriminate slaughter ; children massacred before their affrighted
</p>
<p>" parents, reserved for their greater torture to die a double death ;
</p>
<p>" the first in witnessing the massacre of their innocents, and then
</p>
<p>" being cut down themselves. The contemplation is horrible."
</p>
<p>This was to prepare the minds of the people before the proceedings
</p>
<p>began ; to imbue them with a proper spirit when they assembled at
</p>
<p>the place, which was the scene of this horrible massacre. This was
</p>
<p>sold by thousands. " We allude to these particulars about the dates,

<p>" because Corry and others have fallen into the same error with
</p>
<p>" regard to it as Leland, and because we are anxious to show Irish-
</p>
<p>" men of every class that the antipathy exhibited by England to Ire-
</p>
<p>" land is more a national than a religious one ; fully as much trea-
</p>
<p>" chery, fully as much cruelty, fully as much barbarity having been
</p>
<p>" practised by Catholic England, in proportion to her ability, towards
</p>
<p>" Catholic Ireland, as there has in subsequent years been perpetra-
</p>
<p>" ted by Protestant England. Teutonics and Celts, the races of the
</p>
<p>" two countries, are different; like acids, they will not amalgamate,
</p>
<p>" nor cannot meet without one neutralizing the other. For this rea-
</p>
<p>" son, as well as numberless others, it is necessary that the Parliament
</p>
<p>" of the two countries should be separate, and the inhabitants of each
</p>
<p>" be brought as little into collision with the other as possible." Does
</p>
<p>that mean, that if there were separate legislatures, all connexion was to
</p>
<p>cease between the two countries ? Or what does it mean ? What is the
</p>
<p>meaning of this language thus circulated ? The two people are
</p>
<p>772
</p>
<p>'* acids neutralizing each other;" "nature has forbid it;'' "there
</p>
<p>can be no meeting between such hostile people." Can language be
</p>
<p>conceived more destructive of anything like peace and harmony be-
</p>
<p>tween the people of the two countries? Is it possible, that subjects
</p>
<p>of the same empire can ever have anything but bitter hatred towards
</p>
<p>each other, while this language is circulated ?
</p>
<p>If no other piece of evidence had been laid before you than this,
</p>
<p>which I have just read, could you go out and meet your fellow-citi-
</p>
<p>zens, after finding that there was no intention, no agreement, no con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, no common object, by means of this and other publications,
</p>
<p>to excite in the minds of the people of this country the bitterest hos-
</p>
<p>tility and hatred against England?
</p>
<p>FRIDAY, February 9th.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, from the nature and contents of the document which
</p>
<p>I read to you when I closed yesterday, you can be at no loss to con-
</p>
<p>jecture what sort of feelings it was calculated to excite in the minds
</p>
<p>of the persons assembled at Mullaghmast. I proceed now to call your
</p>
<p>attention to some of the transactions which occurred, and to" the
</p>
<p>speeches which were made upon that occasion ; and I think you will
</p>
<p>see that they were in perfect accordance with the sentiments intended
</p>
<p>to be created by that document.
</p>
<p>A person of the name of Healy was examined as a witness, and
</p>
<p>proved some particulars with respect to this meeting at Mullaghmast,
</p>
<p>to which I must invite your attention. His conception as to the num-
</p>
<p>ber is, that they were not short of one hundred thousand persons.
</p>
<p>He says: " They had about fifty bands, that they had banners, that
</p>
<p>" the bands wore what he calls a sort of uniform, that they had per-
</p>
<p>" sons leading them, who appeared to be in the rank of officers or
</p>
<p>" conductors ; and he was asked whether the dresses which the bands
</p>
<p>" appeared to wear, were not such as had been usually worn by tem-
</p>
<p>" perance bands?" His answer to that was: "That the uniform
</p>
<p>" which they wore was not such as in the commencement of the
</p>
<p>" temperance movement those bands had been distinguished by ; that
</p>

</p>
<p>" a new kind of dress had been used for the occasion." And I think
</p>
<p>you will have arrived already at this conclusion, that as this conspi-
</p>
<p>racy progressed, the approach to an actual military display of force
</p>
<p>became closer and closer. He says: " that the people came huzza-
</p>
<p>ing, with branches of trees, and screeching." He says, " that he ob-
</p>
<p>served several inscriptions." And amongst others, he describes two :
</p>
<p>one "Mullaghmast and its martyrs  a voice from the grave." That
</p>
<p>inscription was also in the banquet room, where the dinner took
</p>
<p>place  as I understood the witness  immediately behind the chair-
</p>
<p>man who presided. There was also an inscription :
</p>
<p>" No Saxon butchery shall give blood gouts for a repast ;
</p>
<p>The dog is roused, and treachery expelled from Mullaghmast."
</p>
<p>773
</p>
<p>lie then describes some other particulars, in which this meeting
</p>
<p>corresponded with those which preceded it ; and with respect to
</p>
<p>which, therefore, I need not detain you. I shall proceed at once to
</p>
<p>the speeches, which, you will recollect, have been deposed to by Mr.
</p>
<p>Hughes.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I regretted to find the epithets of " informer" and
</p>
<p>"government spy" applied to that gentleman. Mr. Hughes came
</p>
<p>here openly in the capacity of a person employed by the Government
</p>
<p>to report what took place. He introduced himself in that character
</p>
<p>to the meeting; he was admitted, known to be a person so employed ;
</p>
<p>and to apply to a gentleman, so circumstanced, the epithet of " spy"
</p>
<p>or " informer," appears to me to be an extremely improper applica-
</p>
<p>tion of those terms.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  Mr. Ross, not Mr. Hughes, I think.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon It was Mr. Ross ; I do not think any person
</p>
<p>applied it to Mr. Hughes.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor General.  I certainly am very much mistaken if
</p>
<p>Mr. Hughes was not so designated, for I put it down, distinctly, at the
</p>
<p>time. The reason that I feel so confident about it is this, that up to
</p>
<p>that time no imputation had been cast on the character of Mr. Hughes ;
</p>
<p>and I was particularly watchful with respect to that, remembering
</p>
<p>what had been thrown out against that gentleman, prior to the com-
</p>
<p>mencement of this trial. I, therefore, am, myself, perfectly confident
</p>
<p>that those terms were applied to Mr. Hughes. If it be now intended
</p>
<p>to withdraw them, of course, I have no objection. But I must protest
</p>
<p>against any impeachment of Mr. Hughes's character now, grounded
</p>
<p>upon his being regarded in the light of a spy, employed to procure
</p>
<p>evidence secretly, or coming forward in the character of an informer.
</p>
<p>With respect to Mr. Ross, he also is a short-hand reporter, of charac-
</p>
<p>ter, I must say, unimpeached, and his evidence is uncontradicted.
</p>
<p>Both these gentlemen have deposed to what took place at this meet-
</p>
<p>ing. I thought it necessary to say so much with respect to them ;
</p>
<p>though I must do Mr. O'Connell the justice to say, that when he came
</p>
<p>to address you, he fully and candidly admitted the respectability of

</p>
<p>Mr. Hughes's character.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, in the early part of the day Mr. O'Connell addressed
</p>
<p>the multitude assembled, and after cautioning them not to give the
</p>
<p>enemy a hold by the commission of crime, he proceeds to advert to
</p>
<p>what had taken place. " At Tara," says he, " I protested against
</p>
<p>" the Union ; to-day I repeat the protest at Mullaghmast. I declare
</p>
<p>" solemnly my thorough conviction, as a constitutional lawyer, that
</p>
<p>" the Union is totally void in point of principle and constitutional
</p>
<p>" force. I tell you that no portion of the empire has the power of
</p>
<p>" trampling on the rights and liberties of the Irish people. The Irish
</p>
<p>" Parliament was instituted to make laws and not Legislatures; it was
</p>
<p>*' instituted under the Constitution, and not to annihilate it. Their
</p>
<p>" delegation from the people was confined within the limits of the
</p>
<p>" Constitution, and the moment Parliament went beyond and de-
</p>
<p>" stroyed the Constitution, that instant it annihilated its own powers;
</p>
<p>but it could not annihilate that immortal spirit which belonged, as a
</p>
<p>774
</p>
<p>" rightful inheritance, to the people of Ireland. Take it from me,
</p>
<p>" that the Union is void. I admit that it has the force of law, be-
</p>
<p>" cause it is supported by the policeman's truncheon, the soldier's
</p>
<p>" bayonet, and the horseman's sword ; because it is supported by the
</p>
<p>" Courts of law, and those who have power to adjudicate. But I say
</p>
<p>" solemnly it is not supported by constitutional right. The Union,
</p>
<p>" therefore, in my thorough conviction, is totally void, audi will avail
</p>
<p>" myself of this opportunity to announce to several hundred thousands
</p>
<p>" of my fellow-subjects, that that unconstitutional law, the Union, is
</p>
<p>" not fated to last long." After some observations, not material, he
</p>
<p>proceeds : " I have physical force enough about me to-day to achieve
</p>
<p>" anything, but you know full well it is not my plan. I won't risk
</p>
<p>" one of you  I could not afford to lose any of you. I will protect
</p>
<p>" you all, and I will obtain for you all the Repeal of the Union."
</p>
<p>He then adverts to the Speech at the closing of the Session of Par-
</p>
<p>liament ; and this is the way in which he proceeds with reference to
</p>
<p>the declaration made by Her Majesty at the prorogation of the Ses-
</p>
<p>sion : " I am obliged to them" [that is, the Ministers] " for that
</p>
<p>" speech, because it gives me, among other things, the pleasure of
</p>
<p>" addressing such an assembly to-day. I thought the monster meet-
</p>
<p>" ings had demonstrated the opinion of Ireland. I was convinced
</p>
<p>" that their unanimous determination to obtain liberty was sufficiently
</p>
<p>" signified by the many meetings that already took place ; but when
</p>
<p>" the Queen's Ministers' Speech came out, I saw it was necessary to
</p>
<p>" do something more ; accordingly I called a meeting at Loughrea, a
</p>
<p>" monster meeting ; we called another meeting at Clifden, a monster
</p>
<p>" meeting ; we called another meeting at Lismore, a monster meet-
</p>
<p>" ing ; and here we are now upon the Rath of Mullaghmast." Here
</p>
<p>is an explicit avowal, that these several monster meetings had been
</p>
<p>called by him, and the other members leagued with him in the Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation. " At Mullaghmast"  Mark this ; recollect the sentiments
</p>
<p>contained in that document read yesterday, diffused through the
</p>
<p>crowd, the remote part of the crowd, who could not hear the lan-
</p>
<p>guage addressed by the speakers from the platform. It was necessary

</p>
<p>to have something conveyed to them which could not be conveyed
</p>
<p>by words, and for that reason this mode of circulating the same senti-
</p>
<p>ments, and the same incentives, was adopted. " I chose it [that is
</p>
<p>Mullaghmast] " for an obvious reason. We are upon the precise spot
</p>
<p>" in which English treachery  aye, and false Irish treachery too,
</p>
<p>" consummated a massacre unequalled in the history of the crimes
</p>
<p>" of the world, until the massacre of the Mamelukes by Mehemet
</p>
<p>" Ali. It was necessary to have Turks to commit a crime in order to
</p>
<p>" be equal to the crime of the English ; no other people but Turks
</p>
<p>" were wicked enough except the English.'' One of the charges here
</p>
<p>is, that there was a combination amongst these persons to excite
</p>
<p>feelings of hostility and ill-will against their English fellow-subjects.
</p>
<p>What is this ? Suppose there was no other document in evidence,
</p>
<p>is not that charge as distinctly proved, as if the parties came forward
</p>
<p>here and pleaded guilty to the indictment ? Then he says : " I
</p>
<p>" thought this a fit and becoming spot to celebrate our unanimity in
</p>
<p>775
</p>
<p>" declaring, in the open day, our determination not to be misled by
</p>
<p>u any treachery. Oh ! my friends, I will keep you clear of all
</p>
<p>u treachery. There shall be no bargain, no compromise, nothing but
</p>
<p>" the Repeal and a Parliament of our own. You will never, by my
</p>
<p>" advice, confide in any false hopes they hold out ; you will confide
</p>
<p>" in nothing until you hear me say I am satisfied ; and I will tell you
</p>
<p>" where I shall say that  near the statue of King William in College-
</p>
<p>" green. No, we came here to express our determination to die to
</p>
<p>" a man, if necessary ; but we came to take the advice of each other ;
</p>
<p>" and, above all, you came here to take my advice. I have the game
</p>
<p>" in my hands ; I have the triumph secure ; I have the Repeal cer-
</p>
<p>" tain, if you obey my advice. I will go slow ; you must allow me to
</p>
<p>" do it ; but I will go sure. No man shall be fined ; no man shall be
</p>
<p>" imprisoned ; no man shall be prosecuted who takes my advice.
</p>
<p>" I have led you thus far in safety ; I have swelled the multitude of
</p>
<p>" Repealers, till they are so far identified with the entire population
</p>
<p>" of the soil, or nearly so. I have seven-eighths of the population of
</p>
<p>" Ireland enrolling themselves as associates. [Cries of ' more power
</p>
<p>" to you.'] I do not want more power. I have power enough. All
</p>
<p>" 1 ask of you is to allow me to use it. I will go on quietly and
</p>
<p>" slowly. I am arranging the plan of a new Irish House of Com-
</p>
<p>" mons. It is a theory, but it is a theory that may be realized in three
</p>
<p>" weeks." How to be realized in three weeks by anything like con-
</p>
<p>stitutional or peaceable means, I am utterly at a loss to conjecture ;
</p>
<p>and Mr. O'Connell himself has not. thought fit to explain. Then
</p>
<p>he comes to another branch of this scheme : " The Arbitrators are
</p>
<p>" beginning to sit ; the people are submitting their differences to
</p>
<p>" men chosen by themselves. You will see by the newspapers that
</p>
<p>" Dr. Gray, and my son, and other gentlemen, held a Petty Sessions
</p>
<p>" of their own in the room of magistrates who had been unjustly de-
</p>
<p>" prived. We will submit all our differences to them, and will en-
</p>
<p>" deavour to do justice to all parties, and it will not cost you a single
</p>
<p>" farthing. I shall go on with that plan until I have all disputes de-
</p>
<p>u cided by judges appointed by the people themselves." What now

<p>becomes of the flimsy pretext and allegation, that all that was in-
</p>
<p>tended here was to prevent parties going before magistrates at Petty
</p>
<p>Sessions, to put an end to the profanation of taking oaths; to
</p>
<p>diminish litigation and ill-will ; and all that ? Is there not here a
</p>
<p>direct assumption, on the part of Mr. O'Connell, of the administra-
</p>
<p>tion of the justice of the country ? "I wish to live long enough to
</p>
<p>see justice realized in Ireland." As much as to say  I am now about,
</p>
<p>for the first time, to appoint and establish a judicial system which will
</p>
<p>at length insure the administration of real justice in Ireland. He
</p>
<p>then goes on to an article in the Times newspaper, about the three
</p>
<p>hundred persons whom he had announced he would call together,
</p>
<p>and with respect to whom some observations were made by that
</p>
<p>paper ; and he says : " The Times newspaper called them ' bog-trot-
</p>
<p>" ters,' but better men never stepped upon pavement. I will have
</p>
<p>" three hundred, and no thanks to them." He then proceeds to
</p>
<p>call the attention of the meeting to the condition of Wales, which he
</p>
<p>776
</p>
<p>says is in a stale of insurrection ; and then he adds : " Let the Eng-
</p>
<p>" lish have England, let the Scotch have Scotland, but we must have
</p>
<p>" Ireland for the Irish." Then he says : " We will be obedient to
</p>
<p>" the Queen, joined to England by the golden link of the Crown."
</p>
<p>How long that link would last or continue, in case this scheme, which
</p>
<p>he then bad in agitation, had been carried to its consummation, you
</p>
<p>may, I think, very easily conjecture. He then says : " Oh ! my
</p>
<p>" friends, listen to the man of peace, who will not expose you to
</p>
<p>" your enemies. In 1798, there were brave men at the head of the
</p>
<p>" people at large ; there were some valiant men, but there were
</p>
<p>" many traitors who left the people exposed to the swords of the
</p>
<p>"enemy." The enemy ! Who are the "traitors?" The "traitors"
</p>
<p>are those persons who left the rebels of 1798 exposed to the swords
</p>
<p>of " the enemy,'' that is, of those who put that rebellion down.
</p>
<p>" On the Curragh of Kildare you confided your military power
</p>
<p>" to your relations; they were basely betrayed and trampled under
</p>
<p>" foot ; it was ill organized ; a premature, a foolish, and an absurd
</p>
<p>" insurrection." Such is the way in which this loyal subject speaks
</p>
<p>of the rebellion of 1798, that it was "a premature, foolish, and ab-
</p>
<p>surd insurrection." " But you have a leader now, who will never al-
</p>
<p>low you to be led astray." What is the meaning of "led astray ?"
</p>
<p>This ; your present leader, will never allow you to break out too soon ;
</p>
<p>never allow you to frustrate that by premature impatience, which
</p>
<p>can only be successful by a regular course of organization and prepa-
</p>
<p>ration. " Oh ! how delighted I am with the thorough conviction that
</p>
<p>" has come upon the minds of the people, that they could not gratify
</p>
<p>" their enemies more than by committing a crime. No, yourances-
</p>
<p>" tors suffered for it ; they suffered for confiding in the English ;
</p>
<p>" but we will never confide in them.'' Now you cannot fail to re-
</p>
<p>mark as this goes on, how much more plain and undisguised the lan-
</p>
<p>guage and declarations of these parties become : " I was delighted
</p>
<p>" with the stalwart and strong men of Kildare. I was delighted with
</p>
<p>" the activity and force that I saw around me ; and my old heart
</p>
<p>" grew warm again in admiring the beauties of the dark-eyed maids

<p>" and matrons of Kildare. Oh ! there is a star-light sparkling from
</p>
<p>" the eye of a Kildare beauty that is scarcely equalled all over the
</p>
<p>" world; and remember you are the sons, you are the brothers, you
</p>
<p>" are the husbands of such women, and traitor or coward can never
</p>
<p>" be attributed to you. Yes, I am in a county remarkable in the
</p>
<p>" history of Ireland for its bravery, and for its misfortunes ; for its
</p>
<p>" credulity in the faith of others instead of judging for themselves;
</p>
<p>" in the sacredness of its shrines and its fanes. I am in a county
</p>
<p> c where Kildare's holy shrine burned with its sacred fire through ages
</p>
<p>" of darkness and of storm. The fire was never extinguished, and
</p>
<p>" the light was never quenched before the high altar of Kildare's
</p>
<p>" cathedral for more than five or six centuries ; it blazed constantly
</p>
<p>" and unremittingly ; it was fed continuously, and without the slightest
</p>
<p>" interruption; and it seems to me a guarantee, or an assurance, of
</p>
<p>" the religious fidelity and continuous love of country. Even your
</p>
<p>" enemies admit that the world has not produced any men that can
</p>
<p>i ii
</p>
<p>" exceed the Irishmen, in activity and strength. The Scotch philo-
</p>
<p>" sopher and the French philosopher has confirmed it, that number
</p>
<p>i( one in the human race is, blessed be Heaven ! the Irish. In moral
</p>
<p>" virtue, in religious perseverance, in glorious temperance ; have you
</p>
<p>" any teetotalers there? [Cries of ' Yes.'] Yes ; it is teetotalism
</p>
<p>" that is repealing the Union. I could not afford to bring you to-
</p>
<p>" gether, I would not dare to do it, if I had not had teetotalers for
</p>
<p>" my police." I would not have dared to do it. Why ? "I would
</p>
<p>" not have ventured to bring together so many individuals as I have
</p>
<p>" now assembled round me, because the necessary consequence of it
</p>
<p>" would have been an outbreak, were I not perfectly assured from
</p>
<p>" the previous preparation and discipline to which I knew they had
</p>
<p>" been subjected, and their temperance habits, that I might do so
</p>
<p>" with safety." Is not this the strongest expression of Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell's own conviction of the natural tendency of these meetings, and
</p>
<p>of the difficulties of restraining them from actual violence ? Nothing
</p>
<p>but his own conviction of the complete success of the organization,
</p>
<p>which he had consummated by the Repeal Wardens, and the other
</p>
<p>organs of this Association  nothing but that conviction would have
</p>
<p>induced him to run the hazard of bringing them together.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, so much for Mr. O'Connell's speech at the meeting
</p>
<p>itself. There was a dinner or banquet at this Rath of Mullaghmast,
</p>
<p>in a pavilion, erected for the purpose. How the expense of these
</p>
<p>several things was defrayed, does not appear, but you can probably
</p>
<p>draw some sort of inference. At the dinner, I find from Mr. Hughes's
</p>
<p>evidence, that there were present Mr. O'Connell, Mr. John O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell, Mr. Ray, Mr. Steele, Mr. Barrett, and Dr. Gray. Mr. John
</p>
<p>O'Connell presided at the dinner, and he introduced the toast of the
</p>
<p>Queen's health with these words : " I do not, because I cannot an-
</p>
<p>" ticipate, that in any phase of circumstances, the toast I have now to
</p>
<p>" give will be received otherwise than well by Irishmen ; it is the
</p>
<p>" health of the Queen. Whatever may happen, her throne in Ireland
</p>
<p>" is secure. When, the other day, we distinguished between the
</p>
<p>" vain and babbling words that were put into her mouth, we distin-

</p>
<p>" guished well between the Monarch and the Ministers, and we would
</p>
<p>" make the same distinction as clearly, and as well, were bloody
</p>
<p>" deeds and hard blows to be attempted." Bloody deeds and hard
</p>
<p>blows. " Her Ministers may fix her throne amidst bloody fields, and
</p>
<p>" blazing cities, and slaughtered corpses ; let them take care that the
</p>
<p>" ruddiest stream flowing might not be their own blood, and the
</p>
<p>" brightest and fiercest flame might not be from the strongholds from
</p>
<p>" which they now insult the Irish people." Meaning, I suppose,
</p>
<p>London. That is the manner in which the loyal toast of the Queen's
</p>
<p>health was introduced by Mr. John O'Connell. Some letters were
</p>
<p>read, apologising for the absence of certain gentlemen from this meet-
</p>
<p>ing ; and, amongst the rest, one from Mr. Thomas Ffrench was read,
</p>
<p>containing this passage : " This mighty movement, unprecedented in
</p>
<p>" the history of nations, has now assumed a magnitude much too im-
</p>
<p>" mense to admit of retrograde or compromise. It has, in fact, terri-
</p>
<p>" fied the foes, as much as it has delighted the friends of Ireland.
</p>
<p>5g
</p>
<p>778
</p>
<p>" Some step must and will be taken. Menaces have been tried with
</p>
<p>H signal discomfiture. Overtures of peace will doubtless be now ex-
</p>
<p>" perimented ; promises of conciliation and pledges as to the removal
</p>
<p>" of grievances. Can these be now accepted? I answer, Never!
</p>
<p>" never !" The next speaker appears to have been Mr. Barrett ; and
</p>
<p>in a speech delivered by that gentleman on this occasion, you will find
</p>
<p>the same admission and confession on his part, as to the motives of
</p>
<p>calling these meetings and attending them, as had been previously
</p>
<p>avowed by Mr. O'Connell. " It has been said, that as we visited the
</p>
<p>" hill of Tara, to recall the virtues and glorious days of Irishmen, in
</p>
<p>" order to awaken the sentiments by which we may be restored to in-
</p>
<p>" dependence, so we visited the Rath of Mullaghmast to-day, to re-
</p>
<p>" collect the treachery by which Ireland was betrayed, and to prevent,
</p>
<p>" as one of these letters said, the credulity which would again expose
</p>
<p>" this oppressed country to Saxon turpitude." He then adverts to
</p>
<p>the massacre, and says : " A set of chieftains may not always be in-
</p>
<p>" veigled by the Government ; the times may alter; but the spirit of
</p>
<p>" England is the same, whether it is manifest in the breaking of the
</p>
<p>" solemn pledge of hospitality"  that is, by the massacre  " or the
</p>
<p>"solemn pledge of political justice." He then adverts to the pro-
</p>
<p>gress of the Repeal question, and says: " That Mr. O'Connell had
</p>
<p>" called the meeting, for the purpose of showing that the Queen's
</p>
<p>* Speech had not, in the slightest degree, affected the progress of the
</p>
<p>" movement." Mr. Barrett, I think, has very unequivocally expressed
</p>
<p>his sentiments in that part of his speech.
</p>
<p>He was followed by Mr. O'Connell ; and Mr. O'Connell also
</p>
<p>takes up the speech delivered by Her Majesty at the prorogation of
</p>
<p>the session ; and observe the way in which he treats that speech.
</p>
<p>He affects, as usual, to distinguish between Her Majesty and her
</p>
<p>Ministers, and he says that the Duke of Wellington having declared
</p>
<p>for war, he had replied in a tone of firm defiance, and the threat of
</p>
<p>war vanished ; ami the threat of war having been given up  " They
</p>
<p> then," he says, " brought out the Queen against us : dear lady ! I
</p>
<p>" have the greatest respect for her ; but I know the words were

<p>*'' not her's ; but I take her speech, and that very speech is the
</p>
<p>" very reason we are here this very evening for Ireland ; we had
</p>
<p>" made those demonstrations before hundreds of thousands of fighting
</p>
<p>" men. One would think you had a taste for fighting." This he
</p>
<p>says to the people assembled, in consequence, I suppose, of some
</p>
<p>expression of approbation. " One would think you had a taste for
</p>
<p>" fighting. They had met, and they had proclaimed by their meet-
</p>
<p>" ing, the national determination for the regeneration of the country.
</p>
<p>" Yes, it would have been enough to have exhibited the national
</p>
<p>" will in the meetings that preceded that speech, but it becomes
</p>
<p>" necessary to show that there was nothing in the ministerial speech,
</p>
<p>" though put into the mouth of the Sovereign, that could deter
</p>
<p>" resolute and rational men from the pursuit of their liberty, and if
</p>
<p>" instead of one speech she had made a hundred speeches, the effect
</p>
<p>" would have been precisely the same." " Dear lady ! I have the
</p>
<p>greatest respect for her ! !" He then proceeds to a declaration of
</p>
<p>779
</p>
<p>the motives which influenced him, and those associated with him, in
</p>
<p>calling this meeting; I mean at this particular place. " We would
</p>
<p>" not have met at Mullaghmast to-day, if it were not to show the
</p>
<p>" futility and falsehood of the expectation that it would run out ;
</p>
<p>" otherwise this meeting would not have been necessary." Now
</p>
<p>mark this : " A few more we shall have by way of tilly. I have five
</p>
<p>" or six or seven yet unarranged : these at least we shall have, and
</p>
<p>" I think by that time the Ministry will be tolerably convinced that
</p>
<p>" the do-nothing policy will not heal the sores of Ireland, or profit
</p>
<p>" their policy much." He then says : " No country ever yet pros-
</p>
<p>" pered that was governed by other people ; and our country's only
</p>
<p>" prospect of prosperity is governing herself." Now observe this
</p>
<p>passage : " Instead of lapsing into indifference, I confess the appre-
</p>
<p>" hension I had was, that the people would be too impatient. I was
</p>
<p>" afraid they had not yet confidence in their leader. [Cheers, and
</p>
<p>" cries of ' we have.'] How my heart thanks you for that shout !
</p>
<p>" It is a reply to my apprehensions. Yet knowing her grievances,
</p>
<p>" knowing the burning ardour of her sons, knowing their gallantry
</p>
<p>" and fearless bravery, knowing how little they value the risk
</p>
<p>" of life, and the certainty of death, if the liberty of Ireland were
</p>
<p>" to be the prize for which they were to make that sacrifice" 
</p>
<p>he might have added, " knowing the state of desperate excite-
</p>
<p>ment to which I have worked them up ;"  '' knowing all this  I did
</p>
<p>" apprehend  it came over me occasionally, it was like the incu-
</p>
<p>" bus of a sickly dream, and disordered every faculty of my mind 
</p>
<p>" I was afraid that somewhere there would have been an out-
</p>
<p>" burst to gratify the enemy, that would delight Sir Henry Har-
</p>
<p>" dinge, and would give employment for those who eat the biscuit
</p>
<p>" and drink the brandy in his barracks. Oh ! do you tell me now 
</p>
<p>" you need not  was not the determination expressed for every man
</p>
<p>" to abide his hour, to wait his time, to take no other steps but those
</p>
<p>" which the counsel of wise men, and the sanction of the anointed
</p>
<p>" priests of God should offer to him as the mode of obtaining the li-
</p>
<p>" berty of his country ?" Notwithstanding all the care I had taken

</p>
<p>to prevent it, says Mr. O'Connell, it came occasionally over my
</p>
<p>mind, like the incubus of a sickly dream ; I had a dreadful appre-
</p>
<p>hension that all my precautions would have been frustrated, that
</p>
<p>an occasion would have been afforded by the appearance of the mi-
</p>
<p>litary and the authorities for some violence, the effect of which
</p>
<p>would be, to check the progress of this conspiracy. My heart is
</p>
<p>relieved from that uneasiness by the confidence you still manifest
</p>
<p>in your leader ; by your showing that you are still ready to abide
</p>
<p>your time, and wait the event. Now comes a reference to the
</p>
<p>administration of the law. " The administration of the law we want
</p>
<p>to get out of the hands of the enemy." If Mr. O'Connell were to
</p>
<p>come forward, and plead guilty to that part of the charge, he really
</p>
<p>could not more fully confess so much of the indictment than he has
</p>
<p>done in this passage. " The administration of the law we want to
</p>
<p>" get out of the hands of the enemy. The Arbitration Courts are
</p>
<p>" working well, and there are already Judges selected by them.
</p>
<p>780
</p>
<p>" selves. [A cry of ' Blaekrock.'] Oh ! there is not a rock of any
</p>
<p>" colour but where we will have them. I want to show the nations
</p>
<p>" of Europe that we are capable of administering our judicial business
</p>
<p>" ourselves." Not merely the Petty Sessions' business, but the
</p>
<p>whole judicial administration of the country is to be confided to their
</p>
<p>hands ; they are fully capable of conducting it to the satisfaction of
</p>
<p>the world at large. " I want to show the nations of Europe that we
</p>
<p>" are capable of administering our judicial business ourselves ; that
</p>
<p>" we do not want the Saxon and the stranger ; and above all,
</p>
<p>" we do not want bigoted men to serve us, or to do our business."
</p>
<p>We do not want judges appointed according to the law and Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion of this country, where the Saxons have a voice in the Legisla-
</p>
<p>ture, but we want the administration of justice lodged in the hands
</p>
<p>of people in whom we ourselves have confidence, whom we consider
</p>
<p>sufficient to conduct our judicial business. We do not want the
</p>
<p>assistance of the Saxon and the stranger.
</p>
<p>Again he comes to Mullaghmast, and he actually circulates him-
</p>
<p>self the very matter which was contained in that document which I
</p>
<p>read yesterday, and against which such a strenuous struggle was
</p>
<p>made to exclude it from the evidence. " It is not by accident that
</p>
<p>" to-night we are on the Rath of Mullaghmast ; it was deliberate dc-
</p>
<p>" sign ; and yet it is curious what a spot we are assembled on. I an-
</p>
<p>" ticipated it, and I now rejoice in it ; where my voice is sounding,
</p>
<p>" and you are quiet hearers, attentively listening ; there, was once
</p>
<p>" raised the yell of despair, the groan of approaching death, the agony
</p>
<p>" of inflicted wounds on the perishing and the unarmed. In this very
</p>
<p>" spot they fell beneath the swords of the Saxons, who used them se-
</p>
<p>" curely and delightfully in grinding their victims to death. Here
</p>
<p>" the Saxon triumphed ; here he raised a shout of victory over his
</p>
<p>" unarmed prey ; upon this very spot four hundred able men perished,
</p>
<p>" who, confiding in Saxon promises, came to a conference of the
</p>
<p>" Queen's subjects, and in the merriment of the banquet they were
</p>
<p>" slaughtered. They never returned home but one ; their wives were
</p>
<p>" widowed, their children were orphans ; in their homesteads the

</p>
<p>' shriek of despairt ; the father and the husband steeped in their own
</p>
<p>" blood. Their wives and mothers wept over them in vain. Oh !
</p>
<p>" Saxon cruelty! How it does delight my heart to think you dare
</p>
<p>" not attempt such a feat again ! " What does it signify who printed
</p>
<p>the document that was circulated amongst the mob at Mullaghmast ?
</p>
<p>What signifies it whether the printer was paid out of the funds of the
</p>
<p>Association? What signifies it whether it was Mr. O'Connell, or
</p>
<p>Mr. Ray, or any of the traversers, who caused that paper to be print-
</p>
<p>ed ; or some other person entertaining the same designs ? Have 1
</p>
<p>not here, from Mr. O'Connell's own lips, the same sentiments, ex-
</p>
<p>presssed in language, if possible, stronger and more exciting? For
</p>
<p>the purpose of creating in the minds of the immense multitude as-
</p>
<p>sembled there, the most bitter and unextinguishable hostility against
</p>
<p>their fellow-subjects in England, by raking np the earlier passages of
</p>
<p>history (whether true or fabulous is indifferent), and by telling them
</p>
<p>in express terms, as he has done, that the very same spirit which ani-
</p>
<p>781
</p>
<p>mated the Saxons of that clay actually exists at this moment, and is
</p>
<p>the feeling entertained towards the people of this country by the
</p>
<p>great body of the English people : " Oil ! England, England ! thy
</p>
<p>" crimeshave filled the cup of bitterness, and the hour of the vengeance
</p>
<p>" of God, I much fear, cannot be far from you." He then goes on in
</p>
<p>the same strain, and in the most exciting language. He says that
</p>
<p>" the Union has deprived us of our franchise power ; the power of
</p>
<p>" returning members is going out of Ireland ; amongst the iniquities
</p>
<p>" of England towards Ireland it did not give us a sufficient franchise."
</p>
<p>But he goes on to say : '' I was sorry for it then," That is, when
</p>
<p>he formerly adverted to it, I suppose : " But I am glad of it now,
</p>
<p>" for the more cause of quarrel I have with them, the better I like
</p>
<p>" it. I should be sorry if they attempted to bungle up any good for
</p>
<p>" Ireland." I should be sorry that the feeling of hatred which I am
</p>
<p>endeavouring to instil into your minds against your fellow-subjects in
</p>
<p>England, should be mitigated in any degree by any thing like an at-
</p>
<p>tempt, even a successful attempt, to make any improvement in Ire-
</p>
<p>land by the Imperial Legislature.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, we find that Dr. Gray also addressed a speech to the
</p>
<p>people assembled at the dinner, from which I shall beg to extract a
</p>
<p>passage or two. He was called upon to return thanks for some
</p>
<p>toast, " The Press," or " The People;" I am not certain which. He
</p>
<p>adverts to the case of the Arbitrators, and he says : " He is proud
</p>
<p>" to stand up to return thanks, not on behalf of this class, or of that
</p>
<p>" class, but on behalf of the Judges appointed by the people  for the
</p>
<p>" first time the people's Judges." Now is this calculated to bring the
</p>
<p>administration of justice into contempt or not ? What is the mean-
</p>
<p>ing of it ? " For a long time past they were in the habit of being
</p>
<p>ruled, and governed, and trampled upon by aliens and enemies."
</p>
<p>All this, observe, relates to the judicial administration of the coun-
</p>
<p>try : " By enemies who, though living among us, were not our
</p>
<p>" friends ; but now we have persons as our Judges, men selected
</p>
<p>" among ourselves, appointed by ourselves  deriving their authority,
</p>
<p>" not from any patent appointment, not from any constituted assem-

</p>
<p>" bly, but deriving it directly and solely from ourselves. Our ene-
</p>
<p>" mies say, the Judges appointed by the people will be powerless. I
</p>
<p>" tell you they will not be powerless ; their powers are far more ex-
</p>
<p>" tensive than the powers my Lord Chancellor Sugden can confer."
</p>
<p>Bear in mind, while this observation is made, the attempt to answer
</p>
<p>this by the counsel, that this had reference merely to Petty Sessions'
</p>
<p>Courts, and small disputes between parties, which it was expedient to
</p>
<p>have settled without resorting to an oath. " Nay, more ; their pow-
</p>
<p>" ers are more extensive than those possessed by the Chairman, or by
</p>
<p>" an Assistant Barrister ; the Repeal Arbitrators appointed by the
</p>
<p>" people can go to any extent. Magistrates are confined to a very
</p>
<p>" few pounds in civil cases. The Chairman of a county is confined
</p>
<p>" to 20 in civil cases, all they can adjudicate upon is 20 ; and the
</p>
<p>" Repeal Arbitrators, appointed by the people, can adjudicate in
</p>
<p>" cases of 20, without costing the suitor one single penny." Then
</p>
<p>782
</p>
<p>he says, they have a criminal jurisdiction, if criminals could be
</p>
<p>found.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, so terminate the proceedings at Mullaghmast, upon
</p>
<p>the 1st of October ; and I must say, they appear to me to be suf-
</p>
<p>ficiently characteristic of the objects of the parties engaged. Remem-
</p>
<p>ber that Mr. O'Connell, at one of the meetings which I detailed
</p>
<p>yesterday, announced that in pnrsuance of the new plan which had
</p>
<p>been adopted, of calling together large masses of person?, at particu-
</p>
<p>lar spots, calculated to keep up in their minds a feeling of ill-will,
</p>
<p>which he, and those concerned with him, were anxious to perpetuate,
</p>
<p>there was to be a meeting at Clontarf, upon the 8th of October. On
</p>
<p>the 30th of September, there appeared in the Nation newspaper, the
</p>
<p>connexion of which with this Association you already know, an an-
</p>
<p>nouncement, or a programme, if I may so express myself, of the
</p>
<p>manner in which the persons going to that meeting were to be ar-
</p>
<p>rayed. You will remember that at Clifden, and at other later meetings,
</p>
<p>the undisguised phrases used are " military organization," " cavalry
</p>
<p>and infantry," and so on. On this day there appeared this adver-
</p>
<p>tisement : " Repeal Cavalry  Clontarf Meeting. The Committee
</p>
<p>" for this national demonstration being apprised of the intention of
</p>
<p>" many Repealers to appear mounted at Conquer Hill, Clontarf, re-
</p>
<p>" commend the following rules to be observed for the regulation of
</p>
<p>" the cavalcade at this first muster and march of the mounted Re-
</p>
<p>" pealers. " First All mounted Repealers of this city, or from
</p>
<p>" the south and west side of the county, to muster on the open
</p>
<p>" ground, Harcourt-street fields, on Sunday, the 8th of October, at
</p>
<p>" twelve o'clock at noon, and form into troops, each troop to consist
</p>
<p>" of twenty-five horsemen, to be led by one officer in front, followed
</p>
<p>" by six ranks, four a-breast, half distance, each bearing a wand and
</p>
<p>" cockade, distinguishing the number of his respective troop. Se-
</p>
<p>M cond. That regulation wands and cockades will be furnished by
</p>
<p>" the committee to such gentlemen of the city or county as shall
</p>
<p>" apply and be approved of to lead each troop. Third  That no per-
</p>
<p>" son shall be permitted to join the cavalcade without a cockade and

</p>
<p>" wand, and that until one troop is complete no second troop be formed.
</p>
<p>" N. B The Committtee will make the necessary arrangements, to
</p>
<p>" prevent delay or confusion at the turnpike gates. Fourth  Each
</p>
<p>" horseman to take and keep the place assigned to him on joining his
</p>
<p>" troop, and remain in rank until dismissal of the parade in the meet-
</p>
<p>'< ing-field. Fifth.  That such troops as shall have formed by half-
</p>
<p>" past twelve o'clock, do proceed in their order, at slow time, by the
</p>
<p>" following route : Harcourt-street, Stephen's-green, West ; Grafton-
</p>
<p>" street, Westmorland-street, Sackville-street, Britain-street, Sum-
</p>
<p>" mer-hill, Ballybough-bridge, Cloutarf-road. Sixth  The mounted
</p>
<p>" Repealers from the northern parts of the county to muster and form
</p>
<p>" as above prescribed, at the southern extremity of the Howth-road,
</p>
<p>" and bring up the rere of the Dublin cavalcade, to the meeting-field,
</p>
<p>" Conquer Hill. Seventh That the Chairman and Members of
</p>
<p>" the Committee, bearing wands and cockades, do form the mounted
</p>
<p>" staff in advance, and that the muster, march, and parade, at the
</p>
<p>783
</p>
<p>" meeting-field, shall be under their sole order and direction, until
</p>
<p>" dismissed after the proceedings of the meeting have commenced."
</p>
<p>It then proceeds to say that great care must be taken " to preserve
</p>
<p>the order and regularity of the inarch.'' And concludes : " God save
</p>
<p>the Queen  mount for Repeal  march for Clontarf." That ap-
</p>
<p>peared in the Nation of the 30th of September. The announcement
</p>
<p>in one of the public newspapers of such a formidable demonstration
</p>
<p>excited, or was calculated to excite, considerable apprehension. You
</p>
<p>will have no doubt by-and-by, when I read a passage or two from the
</p>
<p>speech of Mr. O'Connell, that the announcement to which I have ad
</p>
<p>verted was the production of the Committee, who had been consi-
</p>
<p>dering the mode in which this military demonstration should be made.
</p>
<p>Either from the existence of such an apprehension, as I have men-
</p>
<p>tioned, or from some other cause, which I do not pretend to know,
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, between the Saturday when the advertisement ap-
</p>
<p>peared, and the next day of meeting of the Association, began to
</p>
<p>reflect that he was going a little too far ; that it was not, at the present
</p>
<p>moment, quite prudent to hold up, in such very undisguised terms,
</p>
<p>the object of this meeting. He found he had been travelling a little
</p>
<p>too fast ; and that the caution which he had so strongly recommended
</p>
<p>to others, he had not fully observed himself. Mark then what took
</p>
<p>place at the meeting of the Association, on the 2nd of October, which
</p>
<p>was the Monday after, that is, the day following the meeting at Mul-
</p>
<p>laghmast.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, in the course of the discussion which took place
</p>
<p>upon that day, and which was of the usual character, says : " I wish
</p>
<p>" to say, I saw with great surprise, in some of the newspapers, on
</p>
<p>" Saturday, a paragraph headed ' Repeal Cavalry, Clontarf Meeting.'"
</p>
<p>" In some of the newspapers on Saturday !" Now, do you think it
</p>
<p>likely, in the first place, that the proprietors of those newspapers, the
</p>
<p>Nation, and the other papers in which it appeared, would have in-
</p>
<p>serted that advertisement of themselves? Do you think it would
</p>
<p>be the unprompted act of the publisher, merely as a newspaper
</p>
<p>editor ? Can you have the least doubt, that it came from a

</p>
<p>source which he considered as an authentic and proper one, and
</p>
<p>that he acted upon it accordingly? But the effect produced by
</p>
<p>it having been found such as I have stated, it was then thought ne-
</p>
<p>cessary to draw back ; and accordingly Mr. O'Connell expressed his
</p>
<p>unfeigned surprise that such a thing should have appeared at all. Pie
</p>
<p>goes on: " I think it was a very good quiz ; but it ought not to have
</p>
<p>" been printed ; and I need not inform the Repeal Association not
</p>
<p>" to pay the least attention to it. We were considering"  now
</p>
<p>attend to this  " we were considering it was quite likely that horse-
</p>
<p>" men would be at the great meeting at Clontarf; of course every
</p>
<p>" gentleman, every Repealer, who has ahorse in Dublin, is likely to
</p>
<p>" ride there." This is what " we were considering." " They must
</p>
<p>" observe the most perfect order, because if the horsemen mingled
</p>
<p>'< with the carriages those on foot might be trampled on. Yes-
</p>
<p>" terday the horsemen at Mullaghmast behaved with the utmost
</p>
<p>" regularity and order, and did not infringe upon the people on
</p>
<p>" foot in the slightest degree. I am sure that will happen at
</p>
<p>T84
</p>
<p>" Clontarf. We will take every precaution, that is all that is
</p>
<p>" necessary; and the advertisement on Saturday is one of the best
</p>
<p>" quizes 1 have seen." Now you will recollect that the advertisement
</p>
<p>on Saturday, among other things, contained this paragraph : " The
</p>
<p>" Committee will make the necessary arrangements to prevent delay
</p>
<p>" or confusion at the turnpike gates.'' Who are " the Committee ?"
</p>
<p>We who were considering that it was likely there might be confu-
</p>
<p>sion, and that it was desirable to preserve order, and therefore
</p>
<p>were deliberating how this thing should be done ; but it was a quiz
</p>
<p>to say that it should be done in the manner advertised ; it was
</p>
<p>wrong to print that. And I will now tell you what we did intend,
</p>
<p>and what we mean to abide by. Accordingly another advertise-
</p>
<p>ment appears which substitutes the word " groups" for " troops."
</p>
<p>The person who corrected the advertisement of Saturday expunges
</p>
<p>the phrases throughout which have a purely military signification,
</p>
<p>and substitutes a few other words, adopting the whole, however, sub-
</p>
<p>stantially, as the basis of the advertisement, which issues and goes
</p>
<p>forth on the Tuesday, as the proper and authentic document. What
</p>
<p>is the truth? That the document which had been unadvisedly ap-
</p>
<p>proved of by the Committee was found to be too strong, and that the
</p>
<p>same Committee (I do not know whether Mr. O'Connell was present
</p>
<p>at it or not ; it would appear that he was from his own language)
</p>
<p>found its effect on Saturday and Sunday to be such as made it impru-
</p>
<p>dent to avow it as authentic ; and one of them therefore takes a pen
</p>
<p>and strikes out the word " conquer," the word " parade," and the
</p>
<p>word " troop," and then it is advertised in the Tuesday morning
</p>
<p>papers with those alterations. The self-same document, except so
</p>
<p>far as it is thus altered, as had appeared on the Saturday. " The Com-
</p>
<p>" mittee will meet at the Corn Exchange each day during the ensuing
</p>
<p>" week, from four to five o'clock. Dated, Corn Exchange, 30th
</p>
<p>" September, 1843." Credit has been taken actually on the part of
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, in the course of this trial, for compliance with the
</p>
<p>desire of certain persons in Dublin, that they should be allowed at
</p>
<p>least the privilege of attending Divine worship on the Sunday unmo-

</p>
<p>lested; and because the hour was altered to accommodate the preju-
</p>
<p>dices (I suppose) of that class of persons ; credit is taken for this,
</p>
<p>that the hour is altered from twelve to two, in order that the people
</p>
<p>of Dublin might have an opportunity of attending their several places
</p>
<p>of Divine worship. What does this demonstrate ? It demonstrates
</p>
<p>that this movement was regularly assuming a military character. On
</p>
<p>this particular occasion the Public took the alarm, it was found they
</p>
<p>were going a little too far, and this document was disavowed, but
</p>
<p>disavowed in such a manner as to convince any man that it was the
</p>
<p>document originally intended to be acted on, that it was repudiated
</p>
<p>only because they were afraid they could not yet safely maintain it.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, upon the day on which that fraudulent alteration  I
</p>
<p>may call it so  that apparent alteration took place in the advertise-
</p>
<p>ment, the Association met ; and there was a speech delivered upon
</p>
<p>that occasion by one of the traversers, to which it is necessary to
</p>
<p>advert, because it is one of the strong circumstances in the case as
</p>
<p>785
</p>
<p>affecting him, and connecting him with this combination ; I mean
</p>
<p>the Rev. Mr. Tierney. The Association met on the 3rd of October ;
</p>
<p>there were several letters read, and amongst them one from the
</p>
<p>Town Commissioners of Loughrea. A number of persons are named
</p>
<p>in that letter, which transmitted some money, and concludes with
</p>
<p>this passage  that certain persons had remitted their subscriptions.
</p>
<p>" One would pay in a few days, and two or three who were recu-
</p>
<p><s sants, it was determined to expel from the body, with all convenient
</p>
<p>" despatch, when the proper opportunity occurred." And then there
</p>
<p>is this remark by Mr. O'Connell : " They are quite right to turn
</p>
<p>out those who will not become Repealers." Here is another of the
</p>
<p>means of coercion which appear to have been resorted to, for the
</p>
<p>purpose of obtaining recruits for this agitation. Mr. O'Connell him-
</p>
<p>self says, that " he had received that letter," and then he goes on:
</p>
<p>" The people of Loughrea responded ; there were two or three
</p>
<p>" hundred thousand people (for I never differ with any body about
</p>
<p>" a hundred thousand persons) assembled there, and a noble race
</p>
<p>" they were. I had occasion before to observe, that such a sight of
</p>
<p>" able-bodied men, light limbed and broad shouldered, fit for any
</p>
<p>" light infantry in the world, never congregated together." And then
</p>
<p>he says they showed a perfect good humour, as of course they
</p>
<p>did.
</p>
<p>Mr. Steele then made a speech, which I need not advert to, be-
</p>
<p>cause Mr. Steele's connexion with Mr. O'Connell is acknowledged
</p>
<p>by himself, and therefore I need not advert to it. Then is read a
</p>
<p>report from the Arbitration Committee, one or two passages of which I
</p>
<p>shall have occasion to allude to. "The salutary institution of Arbitra-
</p>
<p>", tion Courts is here hailed by all classes of the people with nothing short
</p>
<p>*' of ecstatic joy, opening, as it does, a vista through which the coming
</p>
<p>" glories of Ireland's nationality can with delightful distinctness be de-
</p>
<p>" scried, and bringing present positive redemption from a degrading,
</p>
<p>" galling bondage to an alien and hostile magistracy. The patriot prides
</p>
<p>u in the emancipating effects of this magnificent system, while the priest
</p>
<p>" glories in contemplating suppressed litigation, the discontinued pro-

</p>
<p>" fane use of God's adorable name, extinguished animosity and hate,
</p>
<p>" the general diffusion of uninterrupted peace and charity, and the
</p>
<p>" bringing down of Heaven's promised benediction upon the ' peace-
</p>
<p>" makers' and the pacified. In conclusion, let me assure the Asso-
</p>
<p>" ciation that our selection of Arbitrators has been made under the
</p>
<p>" influence of a due appreciation of the highly responsible duties,
</p>
<p>" having to enact the first important prelude to Repeal, and to revive
</p>
<p>" a venerable and hallowed relic of Catholic discipline, ancient as the
</p>
<p>" days of the Apostles, and enforced by as energetic and inspired
</p>
<p>" authority." Now what does this show ? " Our selection of Arbi-
</p>
<p>trators." It puts an end to the pretext that the Arbitrators were to
</p>
<p>be the voluntary appointees of the parties litigating. Then, on the
</p>
<p>report of the Committee as to these Arbitration Courts being read,
</p>
<p>it is moved that it should be adopted, and it is accordingly carried
</p>
<p>that it should be inserted on the minutes, and Mr. O'Connell then
</p>
<p>says : " I believe I shall live to see the day when the hall of the Four
</p>
<p>5h
</p>
<p>786
</p>
<p>Courts will be very empty." So much for confining this to the Petty
</p>
<p>Sessions' Courts : " when the hall of the Four Courts will be very
</p>
<p>empty." That seemed to produce some feeling of merriment
</p>
<p>amongst my brethren at the bar, but you can guess how it was under-
</p>
<p>stood by the people to whom it was addressed. Suffice it to say,
</p>
<p>however, that it shows abundantly an intention to overturn and sub-
</p>
<p>vert the regular tribunals of the country, and substitute in their room
</p>
<p>the Arbitration Courts. Then comes the speech of the Reverend
</p>
<p>Mr. Tierney. Mr. Tierney was present at a meeting on the 15th of
</p>
<p>August, at Clontibret, the same day on which the Tara demonstra-
</p>
<p>tion took place. You will recollect the conversation deposed to by
</p>
<p>M'Cann, the police officer, which is now undisputed. He has sworn
</p>
<p>to it, and there is no kind of answer or denial. His character was as-
</p>
<p>sailed most unwarrantably, but I think I have sufficiently vindicated
</p>
<p>it yesterday. We find Mr. Tierney then, at the Association, on the
</p>
<p>3rd of October, using this language ; he adverts to the progress of
</p>
<p>Repeal, and he asks : " Wherefore do the people who surround Mr.
</p>
<p>' O'Connell wherever he goes, numberless as the waves of the ocean,
</p>
<p>' assemble? Is it for the purpose of looking at the illustrious indivi-
</p>
<p>' dual, to do honour to his presence ? Is it to gaze on the greatest
</p>
<p>' friend of the human race ? Is it to feast the eye to satiety upon
</p>
<p>' one who is marked out by Divine Providence as the saviour of
</p>
<p> his country ? No ; though that would be justifiable in you, still
</p>
<p>'you come here for a better purpose ; you come here to help him,
</p>
<p>' to assist him in rescuing your country from a state of slavery to be
</p>
<p>' a free nation ; you come here to enable him to make your own Ire-
</p>
<p>' land, the land of your birth, the land of the happy and the free.
</p>
<p>' And, let me ask you, are you well prepared to do so ? [Cries of
</p>
<p>' ' yes, ' yes.'] If you are, give him deeds as well as words. I can
</p>
<p>1 answer for the county I have the honour to belong to, Monaghan ;
</p>
<p>' and for the parish that I have also the honour to be priest of, that
</p>
<p>' there we are determined to give our hands as well as our hearts.
</p>
<p>' We are determined to give him acts as well as deeds, and not
</p>
<p>' to leave in his power, or in the power of others, to say the

</p>
<p>' people of the north are cold and frozen like the region they inhabit ;
</p>
<p>' the iron has sunk deep into their hearts, they love not liberty, they
</p>
<p>' deserve to be slaves. Oh ! there was a time when the people of the
</p>
<p>' north, aye, and the men of Monaghan, were found to be the first
</p>
<p>1 to resist, and the last to bend to the proud Saxon; there was
</p>
<p>' a time when they did not shun the battle field. Bear me
</p>
<p>' witness, ye different streams of the Blackwater ; bear me wit-
</p>
<p>' ness, the very parish I have the honour to come from, Clontibret ;
</p>
<p>' bear me witness, Benburb, and the battle of the Yellow Ford, in
</p>
<p>' my neighbourhood. These are bright spots in the history of my
</p>
<p>' locality, and as I am talking of by-gone times, permit me to bring
</p>
<p>1 to your recollection a few facts connected with the history of my
</p>
<p>' country." He then proceeds to give an account of Hugh Earl of
</p>
<p>Tyrone, and a battle in which he was concerned, which he calls one
</p>
<p>of the " bright spots" in the history of Ireland ; and he says : " In
</p>
<p>"- the name of the county I am from, and particularly of my own
</p>
<p>787
</p>
<p>" parish, Clontibret, whore a hundred fights were fought, permit me
</p>
<p>" to hand you, in the name of that parish, in the name of that people,
</p>
<p>" the children of the men that fought the battle of victory, unassisted
</p>
<p>" from any other locality, but being of the north, and of that country
</p>
<p>" alone  permit me in their names, and in my own, to have the
</p>
<p>" honour of handing to you 92."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I am far from saying that we should have
</p>
<p>been warranted in including in this indictment any person who merely
</p>
<p>attended a meeting, or two or three meetings, called together by the
</p>
<p>people we are indicting ; far from it. It is really a gross perversion
</p>
<p>to attribute to us any such intention; we are not prosecuting the
</p>
<p>people that attended the meetings. Some might have attended from
</p>
<p>mere curiosity, some from very innocent motives; we are not prose-
</p>
<p>cuting merely for any such conduct. The persons indicted are those
</p>
<p>who called these meetings together for illegal purposes. Mr. Tier-
</p>
<p>ney's attending the meeting at Clontibret, or at Dublin, would not,
</p>
<p>perhaps, of itself, have justified us in including him in this indictment.
</p>
<p>But when, in addition to his appearing at Clontibret, we found this
</p>
<p>language used by him, in which he himself answers for the state of
</p>
<p>things in his own parish, and in his own county of Monaghan, and
</p>
<p>that they were there determined to give Mr. O'Connell " their hands
</p>
<p>as well as their hearts," we thought it incumbent upon us to include
</p>
<p>Mr. Tierney, as a party in this confederacy. We thought these
</p>
<p>facts furnished abundant evidence to prove, that in the views of
</p>
<p>these parties who promoted the meetings originally, this gentle-
</p>
<p>man fully participated. I have already said, the case of each gen-
</p>
<p>tleman here is perfectly separate and distinct  you must be satis-
</p>
<p>fied, of course, that each and every one of these traversers, or such as
</p>
<p>you are disposed to find guilty, really did entertain the objects and
</p>
<p>intentions we attribute to them. If you can reconcile it to your un-
</p>
<p>derstanding of the evidence, that Mr. Tierney might have attended this
</p>
<p>meeting or that meeting innocently, you will of course act accordingly.
</p>
<p>But you will weigh in your minds what was the meaning of the Spanish
</p>
<p>movement  the pronouncement in Spain ; what was Mr. Tierney's

</p>
<p>own admission of lais conception as to the state of feeling in the army
</p>
<p>as a class : you will take all these circumstances into consideration.
</p>
<p>I do not mean at all to press unduly on that reverend gentleman, or
</p>
<p>any other gentleman in charge ; my duty is to draw your attention
</p>
<p>to the evidence against each, leaving you to draw the proper infe-
</p>
<p>rence from it. I do regret that we felt it our duty, that a gentleman
</p>
<p>of his sacred profession should be included in this proceeding, and
</p>
<p>another now no more, Mr. Tyrrell, whose speech I shall not trouble
</p>
<p>you with ; but it is of the same character with Mr. Tierney's, and
</p>
<p>therefore called on us, as we conceived, to include him in the indict-
</p>
<p>ment. Mr. Tyrrell's case you will, of course, not have to consider now ;
</p>
<p>and you will confine your view of the evidence as applying to Mr.
</p>
<p>Tierney, to the two meetings of the 15th of August and the 3rd of
</p>
<p>October. These are the only two meetings in which we bring Mr.
</p>
<p>Tierney into personal contact with the other persons whom we charge
</p>
<p>in this indictment. But you will judge of the meaning of Mr. Tier-
</p>
<p>788
</p>
<p>ney's language, how far it shows him to have been cognizant of, and
</p>
<p>participating in, the designs of the other persons who are indicted.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the object of calling this meeting at Clontibret, as
</p>
<p>well as all the others, was to revive in the minds of the people of this
</p>
<p>country the recollection of former times, in which there had been
</p>
<p>battles fought, victories gained, or massacres perpetrated ; and th'19
</p>
<p>for the purpose of keeping up that feeling of hostility, which it was
</p>
<p>the anxious desire of these parties to perpetuate. And observe,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, that I am now reading against each person, and proving
</p>
<p>against each person, his own act, and not seeking to visit upon any
</p>
<p>one traverser the guilt of another. I am showing from each indivi-
</p>
<p>dual's own act that he was himself concurring in one common de-
</p>
<p>sign  a design evinced by the identity and the coincidence of the
</p>
<p>acts of the several parties, proved to have been committed by them.
</p>
<p>It is, therefore, a fallacy and mistake to say, that this charge of con-
</p>
<p>spiracy is an unjust attempt to fasten upon one person the guilt of
</p>
<p>another. You will say, whether each person here has not by his own
</p>
<p>act placed himself in that position, which entitles me to say that he
</p>
<p>is a person engaged in this conspiracy ; and if this be so, each indi-
</p>
<p>vidual, is visited, not with the misconduct of another, but with the
</p>
<p>consequences of his own actions, and his own declarations.
</p>
<p>The meeting at Clontarf having been announced, means were
</p>
<p>taken to predispose the public mind for the object and purpose for
</p>
<p>which it was to be held. Accordingly, as at Mullaghmast, a descrip-
</p>
<p>tion was given of the circumstances of the massacre which is alleged
</p>
<p>to have been perpetrated at that place, so when they come to hold
</p>
<p>the meeting at Clontarf, it is deemed expedient that the people
</p>
<p>should be put in possession of what event had occurred at Clon-
</p>
<p>tarf, in order that the desired associations might be created in
</p>
<p>their minds. Accordingly, Mr. Barrett, on the 6th of October,
</p>
<p>which was two days before the meeting was to take place, inserts in
</p>
<p>his Journal, the Pilot, an article called " The Battle of Clontarf."
</p>
<p>** This is the Repeal year. Among the many things that have been
</p>
<p>" done in it to awaken an Irish spirit amongst the inhabitants of this

</p>
<p>" country, and to teach them a self-confidence and a self-respect,
</p>
<p>" nothing has been more effectual than the holding of meetings on
</p>
<p>" particular spots where their ancestors had suffered some great dis-
</p>
<p>" aster, or obtained some signal advantage." There is the policy of
</p>
<p>the thing avowed. " It is, as it were, treading over the days that
</p>
<p>are past, or reading the history of Ireland anew." Reading the
</p>
<p>history of Ireland anew for such a purpose as this ! " It is recalling
</p>
<p>" to our minds, as in a picture, the calamities that our fathers expe-
</p>
<p>" rienced, or the feats they achieved. For this reason it was wise
</p>
<p>" that meetings should have been held at Tara and Mullaghmast, and
</p>
<p>" for this reason it is particularly wise that another should be held at
</p>
<p>" Clontarf. In the whole range of Irish topography no spot is more
</p>
<p>" celebrated than this. It was here that Irishmen, under a com-
</p>
<p>" mander as prudent as brave, taught a lesson to their Danish inva-
</p>
<p>" ders that has never been forgotten. Would to God that there
</p>
<p>" had been soldiers of equal spirit, and commanders of equal pru-
</p>
<p>789
</p>
<p>" dence and bravery, to meet the plundering and blood-thirsty
</p>
<p>" Saxons, in subsequent years, when they first set their feet upon our
</p>
<p>" soil." These are the parties who are not looking to anything like
</p>
<p>separation ; who mean to have the countries united by the golden
</p>
<p>link of the Crown ! " Oh ! if there had, what a world of misery
</p>
<p>" Ireland had been spared ! Should the game of subduing us be at-
</p>
<p>" tempted now, however, such a people exists, and such a com-
</p>
<p>" mander could be found. Some say our deader is too old for the
</p>
<p>" camp or the field. It is false. He is of Herculean frame, buoy-
</p>
<p>" ant in spirit, and youthful in constitution. His age is only sixty*
</p>
<p>" eight years. That of Brian Boroihme, when, on Good Friday, in
</p>
<p>" 1014, he fought and conquered the Danes at Clontarf, was
</p>
<p>" eighty-eight years. This should serve to warn our rulers
</p>
<p>u against wantonly attacking O'Connell. Clontarf  they should re-
</p>
<p>" member Clontarf!" Mr. Barrett, in a subsequent part of the
</p>
<p>same paper, gives an historical account of the battle. He then
</p>
<p>goes on to give an account of an engagement in which these
</p>
<p>Dal-Cassians were concerned, and were engaged ; and concludes
</p>
<p>thus : " May the Irish people of the present day, should they be
</p>
<p>"driven to it, imitate the conduct of the brave Tipperary men, or for-
</p>
<p>" mer Dal-Cassians." This, Gentlemen, was for the purpose of
</p>
<p>seasoning and preparing the minds of the masses of the people for
</p>
<p>Clontarf. It is a matter of notoriety that that meeting did not take
</p>
<p>place, in consequence of the nature of the advertisement announcing
</p>
<p>it, and the apprehension entertained of a disturbance of the public
</p>
<p>peace ; it was prohibited by the proclamation of the Lord Lieutenant
</p>
<p>and Privy Council. A good deal has been said, particularly by Mr.
</p>
<p>Moore, with respect to the policy of this interference. Upon that
</p>
<p>subject, I am sure you will agree with me, that we are not here to
</p>
<p>decide. It is one of the very many topics which have been intro-
</p>
<p>duced into this case, without any proper concern or connexion with
</p>
<p>it, and which ought to have no influence upon your verdict. If that
</p>
<p>meeting was improperly dispersed, there are modes of having any-
</p>
<p>thing that was done on that occasion questioned. If any individual

<p>who chose to attend that meeting were disposed to question the lega-
</p>
<p>lity of that interruption, or of the means by which that meeting was
</p>
<p>stopped, he might have brought the subject to a legal investigation.
</p>
<p>He had a simple course to pursue ; he might have gone to the place ;
</p>
<p>if he were interrupted in going there, he might have tried the vali-
</p>
<p>dity of such an interruption, and the question of the legality of that
</p>
<p>meeting might in that way have arisen. But it is not for us here to
</p>
<p>decide on the propriety of the policy which dictated the interruption
</p>
<p>of that meeting. If that interposition on the part of the executive
</p>
<p>had not taken place, what do you suppose might have been the posi-
</p>
<p>tion of things at present ? You will recollect, that Mr. O'Connell,
</p>
<p>at the meetings that had taken place shortly before that time, had an-
</p>
<p>nounced his intention of having assembled, either at the end of the
</p>
<p>last, or the beginning of the present year, three hundred persons,
</p>
<p>each with a certain sura of money  in the character, in fact, of legis-
</p>
<p>7S0
</p>
<p>lators, or at all events, of negotiators with the British parliament.
</p>
<p>They were to hold their sitting here. This he would do in spite of
</p>
<p>the Convention Act, or any other Act. In short, this would have
</p>
<p>been, as far as one can at present judge, a sort of consummation of
</p>
<p>the plans he then had in contemplation ; it would have added legisla-
</p>
<p>tion to all the other functions, which had been usurped by himself,
</p>
<p>or by his associates. However, the stopping of the Clontarf meet-
</p>
<p>ing appears to have arrested the progress of those proceedings. How
</p>
<p>they might have otherwise terminated  how far Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>might have involved himself  how far he might have been implicated
</p>
<p>in point of law, it is not for me now to say; perhaps it may be as
</p>
<p>well for him that it did not go so far.
</p>
<p>The traversers' counsel read, as part of their case, certain pas-
</p>
<p>sages from a speech of Mr. O'Connell s, which was delivered by him
</p>
<p>at a meeting of the Association on the 9th of October, in Calvert's
</p>
<p>Theatre. At that meeting, it appears, a certain person of the name
</p>
<p>of Hanley, of Manchester, was presented to the notice of the Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation, and he delivered an address from the Repealers of Manches-
</p>
<p>ter, in answer to which Mr. O'Connell made some observations,
</p>
<p>which were thought to be material to his defence by his counsel, and
</p>
<p>were accordingly read. In that address, the Manchester Repeal
</p>
<p>body, after paying a very high compliment to the exertions of Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell in the cause of Repeal, say : " Yes, illustrious Sir,
</p>
<p>" though unwillingly located in a stranger land, our feelings are still
</p>
<p>" keenly alive to the numberless wrongs and persecutions inflicted
</p>
<p>" upon our unhappy country by those alien legislators, whose cruel
</p>
<p>" and unjust laws have made us exiles from the homes and hearths of
</p>
<p>" our fathers." What these persons meant by that I really do not
</p>
<p>profess to understand. I am not aware what part of the policy of the
</p>
<p>Legislature of the sister country made these persons " exiles from the
</p>
<p>homes and hearths of their fathers," or what there is suggested to
</p>
<p>justify the assertion that they had been expatriated : " And our re-
</p>
<p>" gret for the ties we have left behind us still remains undiminished.
</p>
<p>" Absence but strengthens our love for the land which gave us birth."

</p>
<p>They then say that " Saxon tyranny has adopted a barbarous policy
</p>
<p>" in withholding from this country her just and sacred rights, and
</p>
<p>" that their hearts ' pant with eagerness to reach the destined goal of
</p>
<p>" liberty.' " Then they go on : " But should our despotic riders 
</p>
<p>" our cruel and relentless Saxon task-masters, men possessed of hearts
</p>
<p>" devoid of feeling, and of power but to destroy  attempt by brute
</p>
<p>' force to crush the struggle for Irish liberty which has now ripened
</p>
<p>" into maturity, we are as firmly resolved to sacrifice our lives as the
</p>
<p>" price by which the blood-stained standard of Saxon despotism shall
</p>
<p>" ever again be permitted to rear its distorted head, or float trium-
</p>
<p>" phant throughout our green and lovely isle, while it is our earnest
</p>
<p>" and increasing prayer that the same illustrious being who has be-
</p>
<p>" come the triumphant and bloodless victor of the religion, rights,
</p>
<p>"and privileges of his grateful and attached countrymen"  and so
</p>
<p>" on  " may bring the cause to a consummation." And then they
</p>
<p>791
</p>
<p>proceed to say, that they had abstained from all illegal societies, for
</p>
<p>the purpose of giving their oppressors no cause of triumph.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, that address from the Manchester Re-
</p>
<p>pealers appears to have been agreed to, before the intimation had
</p>
<p>arrived that the meetings were stopped. On the 7th of October, or
</p>
<p>the 6th of October, I forget exactly on which, the proclamation
</p>
<p>issued immediately before the meeting at Clontarf, and the issuing
</p>
<p>of that proclamation announced to Mr. O'Connell the determi-
</p>
<p>nation of the Government that these proceedings should not take
</p>
<p>place. Then was issue joined with Mr. O'Connell upon the grand
</p>
<p>question as to the legality of the meetings that had taken place, and
</p>
<p>of the proceedings to which he and the other traversers had been privy.
</p>
<p>Month after month, meeting after meeting, he had been telling the
</p>
<p>people assembled about him, that he would carry them safely through,
</p>
<p>that they were violating no law, that he would defy the Attorney-Ge-
</p>
<p>neral, that he dared the Government to attack them ; but when the
</p>
<p>attack (if I may socall it) is made, when it is announced, by that pro-
</p>
<p>clamation, that it is the intention of Government not to suffer this to
</p>
<p>go on, observe the way in which he answers this address, which echo-
</p>
<p>ed the sentiments that he had previously expressed, in ascribing to
</p>
<p>the people of England the tyranny, oppression, and misgovernment,
</p>
<p>which had always distinguished what is called " Saxon rule and des-
</p>
<p>potism." Observe now the difference in the language of Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell, when the challenge that he throws out is thus accepted; observe
</p>
<p>the contrast between that and the former language which I have de-
</p>
<p>tailed to you. This address appears to have been signed by several
</p>
<p>persons, who represented the different wards in Manchester. Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell says he feels deeply grateful, and so on, but he then pro-
</p>
<p>ceeds : " If there be language of a stronger nature contained in this
</p>
<p>address;" there was language, you will recollect, of a strong na-
</p>
<p>ture ; not strong, compared with what Mr. O'Connell himself had pre-
</p>
<p>viously used, not half so strong, but there was strong language in it,
</p>
<p>indicating the sentiments of the people who signed that address, as to
</p>
<p>the tyranny of Saxon oppression ; but after the 8th of October, when
</p>

</p>
<p>it had been announced to him that he was not to be suffered to go on,
</p>
<p>he thus says: " If there be language of a stronger nature contained
</p>
<p>" in this address, I am only to tell you that the period has now come
</p>
<p>" when caution and coolness are the virtues of patriots and steady
</p>
<p>" men :" No doubt the period had come; but if the language, and if
</p>
<p>the conduct which Mr. O'Connell had been heretofore pursuing had
</p>
<p>been such as not to amount to any violation of the law, such as he was
</p>
<p>not afraid to disavow, why did he not persevere in it? Why did he
</p>
<p>find out, on the 9th of October, that the period had now come, when
</p>
<p>caution and coolness were the first of virtues? He then goes on to
</p>
<p>state his determination to agitate for the Repeal of the Union, as he
</p>
<p>has done upon many other occasions ; and then he adverts to the man-
</p>
<p>ner in which the proclamation had been issued ; and he takes the pro-
</p>
<p>clamation to pieces, not in a very respectful way. It was read here ;
</p>
<p>however, I shall not repeat it. I merely advert to that which was re-
</p>
<p>lied upon by Mr. O'Connell himself, or by his counsel, as in the nature
</p>
<p>792
</p>
<p>of a defence in this case. Observe the language there used, and con-
</p>
<p>trast it with what had been previously expressed. It appears to me that
</p>
<p>so far from vindicating Mr. O'Connell, it amounts to this: "We
</p>
<p>*' have gone too far; I find it out now that the proclamation is is-
</p>
<p>sued; I was not aware of it before; we have used language too
</p>
<p>"strong."
</p>
<p>I believe that I have now gone through what I may call the
</p>
<p>evidence on the part of the Crown, directly bearing upon the
</p>
<p>several parts of this indictment. I think that you can have no doubt
</p>
<p>of these points : that all the persons now upon trial, some more, some
</p>
<p>less, were embarked in one common purpose, not secretly and in the
</p>
<p>dark concocting what is vulgarly called, in common parlance, a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, but publicly adopting the means, for the purpose of carrying
</p>
<p>into complete effect and execution, that agreement, which in point of
</p>
<p>law is a conspiracy, and which can only be reached, legally,
</p>
<p>through the medium of an indictment for conspiracy. It is that
</p>
<p>kind of combination, which can only be reached through the me-
</p>
<p>dium of conspiracy. That is the only legal mode of prosecut-
</p>
<p>ing the offence. I think you must be also satisfied of this : that
</p>
<p>one of the means by which the object was to be effected, was the instil-
</p>
<p>ling into the minds of the people of this country, feelings of the bit-
</p>
<p>terest hostility and ill-will against their fellow-subjects : that another
</p>
<p>of the objects was to create, amongst the minds of the people here,
</p>
<p>disaffection and discontent against the established order of things, the
</p>
<p>Government and Constitution of this country as it now stands : that
</p>
<p>another object was to tamper with the army, to endeavour, as far as
</p>
<p>they could, to create in the minds of the soldiers in the army, an in-
</p>
<p>disposition to act and do their duty, should the occasion arrive when,
</p>
<p>from either the full preparation of the parties, or from any other cause,
</p>
<p>any accident, foreign war, or any other, any thing like outbreak
</p>
<p>might take place : fourthly, that one of their objects was, to dispa-
</p>
<p>rage the administration of justice in this country, by inducing the
</p>
<p>people to believe, that up to this time it had been confided to the
</p>
<p>hands of aliens, enemies, strangers, persons who had no other object

</p>
<p>but to oppress the people: lastly, that they had this design  to en-
</p>
<p>deavour to collect together, in large masses, the physical force of this
</p>
<p>country (not the moral force), in different parts of it, for the purpose
</p>
<p>of creating in the minds of the people so assembled, in the first place,
</p>
<p>this impression, that they might be called upon, and were to hold
</p>
<p>themselves in readiness to be called upon, at a certain time, of which
</p>
<p>their leader would give them notice; and, secondly, at all events,
</p>
<p>and what more particularly bears upon this indictment, for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of creating an impression in England and in this country, that
</p>
<p>there was a physical force ready organized and arranged, to such an
</p>
<p>extent, and so completely finished, that it would be idle and vain to
</p>
<p>attempt to dare to refuse the Repeal of the Union. That is one of
</p>
<p>the objects that are charged in this indictment.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, 1 say that there is no man who has heard
</p>
<p>the evidence which I have here gone through, which is not the evi-
</p>
<p>dence of this man's acts against another man, but of each man's own
</p>
<p>793
</p>
<p>act, and of each man's own publications, and each man's own decla-
</p>
<p>rations  I say, so far as that, that you cannot have the slightest
</p>
<p>doubt, that each and every of those persons, in a greater or less de-
</p>
<p>gree, entertained these common designs, and had these common
</p>
<p>objects. The case for a prosecution may be met and encountered by
</p>
<p>evidence upon the other side. But did you ever meet with an in-
</p>
<p>stance, in the course of your experience as jurors (if you have any
</p>
<p>such experience), in which a charge has been left so utterly unan-
</p>
<p>swered as the present, so far as relates to proof  so totally passed
</p>
<p>by? What was the evidence adduced to rebut this immense mass,
</p>
<p>which I have consumed nearly two days in recalling to your recollec-
</p>
<p>tion ? Mr. Conway, of the Evening Post, was produced, to prove
</p>
<p>that in 1810 there was a meeting of ihe citizens of Dublin, convened
</p>
<p>by the Sheriffs, to petition for a Repeal of the Union. The requisi-
</p>
<p>tion was read, signed by some most respectable citizens, and the
</p>
<p>meeting was convened by the High Sheriff. That was a legal and
</p>
<p>constitutional meeting ; but what has it to do with this case ? No-
</p>
<p>thing upon earth. 1 have already adverted to the statement made by
</p>
<p>Mr. Conway; he was suffered to go down without any cross-exa-
</p>
<p>mination on our part; in truth he had nothing to prove in the case.
</p>
<p>Then was called a most respectable member of the Society of
</p>
<p>Friends, Mr. Perry, who proved the rules of the Quakers' Society,
</p>
<p>prohibiting the members of that body from going to law. I believe
</p>
<p>that is the rule amongst the members, as between each other ; I do
</p>
<p>not know whether it extends to prevent a member going to law against
</p>
<p>a person who is not a member, or vice versa. But, supposing that
</p>
<p>it did, what relation or analogy is there between this practice of the
</p>
<p>Quakers, and the usurpation of the judicial functions of this country,
</p>
<p>by the appointment of Judges by an irresponsible body, the Loyal
</p>
<p>National Repeal Association of Ireland ? What upon earth have the
</p>
<p>rules of the Quakers, as to referring their differences to private arbi-
</p>
<p>tration, to do with that? There was then evidence given as to re-
</p>
<p>ferences to the Ouzel Galley. A gentleman was called for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of showing that disputes of merchants are frequently referred to

</p>
<p>a Society called the Ouzel Galley, and that the Arbitrators receive
</p>
<p>certain fees.
</p>
<p>A person of the name of Morgan was then called, for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of taking the sting out of that pail of the evidence for the
</p>
<p>Crown, which related, you will recollect, to the arch at Tullamore ;
</p>
<p>and certainly I think that they would have been better without that
</p>
<p>witness than with him ; for it appeared, from his testimony, that there
</p>
<p>was a witness who could have thrown light upon this part of the trans-
</p>
<p>action, and that that person was actually in town. Have you the
</p>
<p>slightest doubt, that that person had been applied to ; that the
</p>
<p>able gentlemen who are conducting this defence, comprising some of
</p>
<p>the most eminent and clever men in both professions, had a confer-
</p>
<p>ence with him, and that they found out that it would not do to pro-
</p>
<p>duce him ? To me this is perfect demonstration as to the real fact
</p>
<p>with regard to this arch ; and I have no doubt that, though it was
</p>
<p>5i
</p>
<p>794
</p>
<p>afterwards deemed prudent to take it down, just as it was deemed ex-
</p>
<p>pedient to recal the first advertisement at Clontarf, it had been erected
</p>
<p>by some persons who considered it descriptive of the feelings intended
</p>
<p>to be excited in the minds of the people who were to attend, and it
</p>
<p>shows what was conceived and understood to be the nature and the
</p>
<p>object of all these demonstrations.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, they then read several resolutions and several speeches
</p>
<p>of Mr. O'Connell ; with regard to which I have only this to observe.
</p>
<p>Did you take the dates of those several speeches? You will find that
</p>
<p>they go on, from the beginning of 1841 to about the end of 1842, or
</p>
<p>the commencement of 1843; and then comes the tender point: be-
</p>
<p>yond that it is not considered safe to go. Recollect that the new Re-
</p>
<p>peal Card issued early in 1843; recollect those rules of Repeal War-
</p>
<p>dens in 1843 ; recollect the dates of the several documents, and of the
</p>
<p>several proceedings which took place in 1843 ; and you will at once
</p>
<p>see that it was impossible to go with Mr. O'Connell's speeches, or to
</p>
<p>go with his acts, or the acts of any of these traversers, farther than
</p>
<p>the commencement of the year 1843. Why, it might as well be at-
</p>
<p>tempted to meet the case of the Crown by what Mr. O'Connell said
</p>
<p>in the year 1802, or at the earliest period of his life, or what any
</p>
<p>other of these traversers did or said at any antecedent part of his life,
</p>
<p>to bring that up in answer to this charge, as to call your attention to
</p>
<p>what Mr. O'Connell did, or what this Association did, in 1842.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside.  I beg your pardon. I think it right to correct
</p>
<p>my learned friend. It would not be right in us to read over again
</p>
<p>what had been read by the Crown in 1843. We read our own evi-
</p>
<p>dence.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor -General.  Yes. It was your evidence in answer
</p>
<p>to our's. The Jury heard all that. I am now upon the evidence
</p>
<p>given by you, in addition to that read by you whilst our evidence was
</p>
<p>going on. In the progress of our proofs, the defendants read Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell's repeated addresses and exhortations not to violate the
</p>
<p>law. Let them have the full benefit of that ; that was done all through
</p>
<p>the year 1843 ; I have applied myself to that part of the case. But

</p>
<p>besides this, distinct and substantive evidence on the part of the de-
</p>
<p>fendants has been attempted, in answer to the case of the Crown;
</p>
<p>and that is the subject of my present observations. What further ?
</p>
<p>Not a single petition is presented to the House of Commons, or the
</p>
<p>other House of Parliament, from the commencement of last session
</p>
<p>to its close ; not one. It was necessary to have some pretext for call-
</p>
<p>ing these meetings. Mr. O'Connell and his associates were not to
</p>
<p>go and tell the public : " We want to excite the people against the
</p>
<p>" State, and to promote ill-will against our fellow-subjects, and for
</p>
<p>" that purpose we must have a meeting of two or three hundred thou-
</p>
<p>" sand people." They would not say that ; no, the pretext is " peti-
</p>
<p>tioning ;" the pretext is, " we want to exercise a lawful right." And
</p>
<p>it is not till a great number of these meetings have taken place, that
</p>
<p>we find their real object, and that the pretext for which they were
</p>
<p>called was merely fallacious. It is then, and not till then, that we
</p>
<p>795
</p>
<p>find the real character of them. I say, therefore, that the absence of
</p>
<p>a single petition to Parliament, during- the whole of the last session,
</p>
<p>speaks trumpet-tongued against the flimsy allegation now urged  that
</p>
<p>this was all done in the exercise of a constitutional right, and for the
</p>
<p>mere purpose of taking the sense of Parliament as to the propriety of
</p>
<p>a Repeal of the Union. It does not appear that the principal traverser
</p>
<p>himself went to Parliament, presented any petition, or adopted any
</p>
<p>measure to raise the question in any constitutional way. Nay, more,
</p>
<p>it does not appear that a single petition was signed. The two hun-
</p>
<p>dred and fifty thousand people that assembled at Mullaghmast,
</p>
<p>amongst whom those documents were circulated, are not called upon,
</p>
<p>or any of them who could write, or who could even affix their mark,
</p>
<p>to put their mark to a petition. Not a single petition appears ; not
</p>
<p>one.
</p>
<p>Now, Mr. O'Connell himself has made a very long statement to
</p>
<p>you, and I must say that I never, in my life, heard one so little appli-
</p>
<p>cable to the question which he was called upon to defend. Mr. Henn
</p>
<p>had very properly observed, that you were not empannelled in that box
</p>
<p>to try whether the Union ought to be repealed or not ; he said repeat-
</p>
<p>edly, and most properly, and so did the other counsel  (were I, as
</p>
<p>counsel for the Crown, to go into that topic, I should at once be stop-
</p>
<p>ped, and most properly, by the counsel for the traversers)  you are
</p>
<p>not to try that. So Mr. Henn says, and I perfectly agree with him;
</p>
<p>yet from the commencement to the end of Mr. O'Connell's address,
</p>
<p>that appeared to me to be the only question to which he applied him-
</p>
<p>self. When the great mass of evidence that you have heard is brought
</p>
<p>in array against Mr. O'Connell, is it not to be expected, ought you
</p>
<p>not to expect, that he would give you either a denial, or an explana-
</p>
<p>tion, of the language used by him on these several occasions? Has
</p>
<p>he done so? He has repeatedly dared the Government to the discus-
</p>
<p>sion of the legality of his proceedings ; but has he announced to you,
</p>
<p>or to their Lordships, any one legal, peaceful, or constitutional mode,
</p>
<p>by which he proposed that the Union should be repealed ? How does
</p>
<p>he justify, how does he attempt to justify, his concoction of a new

</p>
<p>Constitution for this country  the number of commoners that are
</p>
<p>to sit in the House of Commons  the places that are to return
</p>
<p>members  the elective franchise  the issuing of writs to boroughs ?
</p>
<p>Has he attempted to vindicate or support the legality of these pro-
</p>
<p>positions? He has repeatedly asserted it to his multitudes who as-
</p>
<p>sembled at the meetings. But he has not here attempted to show
</p>
<p>that these legal, peaceful, and constitutional means exist. What
</p>
<p>does that prove? That this agitation w : as carried on, not for the
</p>
<p>purpose of effecting the object of the Repeal of the Union by any such
</p>
<p>means, but that it was attempted to do it by coercion, by intimidation,
</p>
<p>by the demonstration of those large bodies of persons, by the various
</p>
<p>means we have specified in this indictment. That was the object ;
</p>
<p>because no man knew better than Mr. O'Connell, that he could not
</p>
<p>achieve it in any legal or constitutional way.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, Mr. O'Connell has also adverted to other parts of his
</p>
<p>796
</p>
<p>public life, in which he claims merit for having- assisted in the asser-
</p>
<p>tion of the law. He says, he assisted in putting down a combination
</p>
<p>of workmen at a particular part of his life at great personal hazard to
</p>
<p>himself. It may be so ; 1 am ready to admit it is so ; and, si sic
</p>
<p>omnia he would not have been now an object of prosecution. This
</p>
<p>is a circumstance to which he has a right to refer with satisfaction ;
</p>
<p>and I am very far from wishing to detract from its merit. So with
</p>
<p>respect to his conduct to Sir Abraham Bradley King, which showed
</p>
<p>that he was not actuated by anything like religious or political ani-
</p>
<p>mosity towards that gentleman. He was, on that occasion, aided by
</p>
<p>Mr. Lefroy; but I must say that ample use has been made of that
</p>
<p>topic of defence in the course of this trial. As to Mr. O'ConnelPs
</p>
<p>merits in this transaction, or his conduct upon other occasions, I need
</p>
<p>not tell you they have no bearing whatsoever upon this case. Can
</p>
<p>they afford any explanation or defence of his connexion with this
</p>
<p>combination, or any redemption of his pledge, to prove that his pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings have been legal ? He has not attempted that at all. I
</p>
<p>must, therefore, take leave to say, that on the part of Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell, this is an unexplained and an undenied charge. I ask you, on
</p>
<p>what ground, put forward by Mr. O'Connell himself, could you say
</p>
<p>that he was innocent of the present charge ?
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, he did, in one part of his address, appear to me to
</p>
<p>make a complaint, that an opportunity should have been afforded to
</p>
<p>him to explain his violent speeches. I really did not know what Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell meant by that. In the 6rst place it would appear to me
</p>
<p>to admit that there were passages in his speeches, that at all events
</p>
<p>would require explanation ; but recollect Mr. O'Connell's case, till
</p>
<p>he came here, was, that he was acting in strict accordance with the
</p>
<p>law; that he was violating no principle of the law or Constitution in
</p>
<p>his proceedings : he is called upon to show that that is so, and of
</p>
<p>what does he then complain? Why, that he had had no opportunity
</p>
<p>allowed him to explain himself. If he had no opportunity before
</p>
<p>the prosecution, has he not had the opportunity now ? And has he
</p>
<p>availed himself of it ? Are his acts or speeches either explained or

</p>
<p>denied ? Is not this a case on the part of the Crown, wholly unre-
</p>
<p>butted on the part of the traversers ?
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I think you will find, when you compare the several
</p>
<p>portions of this evidence together, that there did exist, beyond all
</p>
<p>doubt, a plan between the traversers, or some of them  it will be for
</p>
<p>you to say how many  by these reiterated assertions as to the man-
</p>
<p>ner in which this country is governed by the Imperial Parliament, to
</p>
<p>create in the minds of the people of Ireland, what we call " dissatis-
</p>
<p>" faction, disaffection, and discontent against the Government and
</p>
<p>11 Constitution of the realm, as by law established." I think you will
</p>
<p>also find, from the uniform abuse of " the Saxons," from the hold-
</p>
<p>ing them up in the light of oppressors, tyrants, invaders, strangers,
</p>
<p>enemies; raking up the ashes of forgotten feuds, massacres, victories,
</p>
<p>the holding meetings upon spots memorable either for the occurrence
</p>
<p>of tiansactions of that sort, or for battles in which the Irish weie
</p>
<p>797
</p>
<p>arrayed against the English  from the inflaming the naturally high
</p>
<p>feelings of the unfortunate people of this country at these meetings ;
</p>
<p>from all these various means, that there existed also a settled plan
</p>
<p>to inflame their passions, and their animosities, against their fellow-
</p>
<p>subjects, and the people of England in particular. I think you will
</p>
<p>also have no doubt from the publications in the Nation, in the Pilot,
</p>
<p>the speeches of Mr. O'Connell, the allusions to the military, the
</p>
<p>hopes and inducements held out to the sergeants, as to the beneficial
</p>
<p>consequences to that class of men in the army, in case these confede-
</p>
<p>rates had their way, (those publications going on, you will observe,
</p>
<p>simultaneously with the speeches, and with the progress of what I
</p>
<p>may call the military organization of the people themselves)  you
</p>
<p>will have no doubt, from all this, that part of the plan was to tamper
</p>
<p>with, or to neutralise, the army; to have it understood by the people
</p>
<p>of this country, that if it should be necessary to resort to any military
</p>
<p>force to preserve the law, or to prevent outbreak, they might safely
</p>
<p>calculate upon the neutrality of their countrymen, if not their coming
</p>
<p>round to join their ranks.
</p>
<p>I think you will also find, from the holding those multitudinous
</p>
<p>meetings, the calling the people to assemble together to be ready when
</p>
<p>required, the frequent and constant allusions to their immense physi-
</p>
<p>cal force, the accounts laid before them of the victories obtained
</p>
<p>by their ancestors over the persons who invaded this country, the
</p>
<p>descriptions given to them of the military positions which might be
</p>
<p>safely defended in case of attack, and the display of the military
</p>
<p>music, banners, and flags, and the accustoming them in this way to
</p>
<p>military exhibition, and military discipline ; that all this places be-
</p>
<p>yond the shadow of a doubt the intention of these parties, that these
</p>
<p>meetings should present a display and demonstration of physical force,
</p>
<p>which would have the effect of overawing all opposition to the carry-
</p>
<p>ing this measure, which Mr. O'Connell had pledged himself, at all
</p>
<p>hazards, to his three millions of Repealers, at a shilling each, to
</p>
<p>carry per fas ant nefas. That is my construction of it. Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell had pledged himself to carry the Repeal, at one time in three

</p>
<p>months, at another time at the expiration of a month. He had
</p>
<p>pledged himself to effect that object in some manner, in answer to
</p>
<p>those persons who had thus trusted him, advanced their money, and
</p>
<p>enrolled themselves as Repealers ; and finding that to be impracti-
</p>
<p>cable by the regular and constitutional modes, he was driven  I will
</p>
<p>not say he originally contemplated it  but he was driven to make
</p>
<p>those exhibitions of physical force. I am not saying that he had
</p>
<p>formed the intention of using it. I am willing to allow that he is not
</p>
<p>proved to have intended to bring his followers into the field. That
</p>
<p>would be high treason, and we are not indicting him for that offence.
</p>
<p>If, however, he did not mean that these people should actually turn
</p>
<p>out in open rebellion, it is, at least, perfectly plain that he did in-
</p>
<p>tend, by the demonstration of those masses, to create an impression
</p>
<p>in England, and amongst the peaceable people of this country, that
</p>
<p>there was a force at hand, ready to be resorted to when the proper
</p>
<p>798
</p>
<p>occasion should arrive, sufficiently great to overwhelm all opposition,
</p>
<p>and that if the Government did not think fit to adopt what he some-
</p>
<p>times called " their wisest course," to yield at once, and give him
</p>
<p>this measure of Repeal, so as to enable him to redeem his pledge to
</p>
<p>those persons who were associated with him, that force would be re-
</p>
<p>sorted to.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, when you consider also the time when the selection
</p>
<p>of these Arbitrators was determined upon; when you recollect that
</p>
<p>the dismissal of the Magistrates by my Lord Chancellor was the
</p>
<p>reason and the occasion why this was thought of; when you recol-
</p>
<p>lect that those Arbitrators are appointed by the Association ; when
</p>
<p>you recollect the forms of the proceedings which have been
</p>
<p>adopted; when you recollect the constitution of the Courts; when
</p>
<p>you recollect that the Magistrates dismissed are the persons selected
</p>
<p>to adjudicate between the different classes of the people, who are
</p>
<p>connected with the Association ; when you consider all this, you can
</p>
<p>have no doubt whatever, in my opinion, that there was also a settled
</p>
<p>plan to disparage the regular tribunals of this country, and substi-
</p>
<p>tute in their place the tribunals appointed by the Association. Why,
</p>
<p>then, what have w r e here ? We really have here a body usurping
</p>
<p>and assuming all the functions of the State. It is the language, I
</p>
<p>think, of Mr. Duffy, in one of his publications: " We are now in
</p>
<p>" fact a nation ; we have the administration of justice, we have
</p>
<p>" taxation, we have order, we have military discipline, we have
</p>
<p>" foreign policy, and lastly, we have legislation." My learned
</p>
<p>friends on the other side may collect from the history of England,
</p>
<p>or of Ireland, or of any other country, specimens, or instances, of
</p>
<p>meetings called together; they may collect instances of speeches
</p>
<p>made, they may collect demonstrations of large numbers of persons
</p>
<p>for particular purposes; but is there on record, allow me to ask, any
</p>
<p>thing at all approaching to such a state of things as this? Here are
</p>
<p>all the functions, not only of the Legislature, not only of the bench,
</p>
<p>but also of the executive, usurped and assumed by this knot of per-
</p>
<p>sons. It must be a strange state of things in our law, if all that can

</p>
<p>be legal. Have you a doubt, that all these functions have been usurp-
</p>
<p>ed and exercised by the persons who are connected with this move-
</p>
<p>ment ? Do you believe that Mr. O'Connell is one ? Do you believe
</p>
<p>that Mr. Steele has joined him ? Do you think Mr. Duffy has joined ?
</p>
<p>Do you think Mr. Barrett has joined ? Do you think Mr. Ray has
</p>
<p>joined? Do you think that Dr. Gray has joined? Why, each of
</p>
<p>these persons has taken upon him, if I may so say, his particular de-
</p>
<p>partment. We have the Minister of Justice, Dr. Gray ; we have a
</p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer; we have a Prime Minister; we have a
</p>
<p>Lord Chancellor  a Dictator, some one suggests to me ; but really,
</p>
<p>it is perfectly and literally true, that there is scarcely a public depart-
</p>
<p>ment in the State whose functions are not usurped, and scarcely a
</p>
<p>public officer whose duties are not assumed, by some one or more of
</p>
<p>these traversers.
</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen of the .Jury, you will always bear in mind, and it
</p>
<p>799
</p>
<p>is a fact which can scarcely be too often repeated, or too much dwelt
</p>
<p>on, that notone of the reporters of these newspapers has been produced
</p>
<p>as a witness to you. Three of the traversers are proprietors of pub-
</p>
<p>lic newspapers; recollect that they have persons in their employment
</p>
<p>whose exclusive business it is to attend at these meetings, and to
</p>
<p>watch these proceedings, and that not one single individual of all that
</p>
<p>body is produced to contradict a single witness called on the part of
</p>
<p>the Crown. Am I wrong, therefore, in saying that this is an uncon-
</p>
<p>tradicted case?
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, Mr. Sheil has drawn a very strong and pathetic picture
</p>
<p>of the state of distress in this country. I am sorry to say, it is to a
</p>
<p>great extent true. No doubt, very great distress does exist; and I
</p>
<p>believe no one can hesitate to ascribe it to the poverty of this country.
</p>
<p>Whether Mr. Sheil considers that the proceedings which have been
</p>
<p>carried on by this body are calculated to remedy that evil or not, I
</p>
<p>really cannot say ; I suppose he does, or else he would not have in-
</p>
<p>troduced that topic. But what do you suppose might have been the
</p>
<p>state of this country in that respect, if, for the last fifteen years after
</p>
<p>the passing of the Catholic Relief Bill, we had been suffered to reap
</p>
<p>the benefits of a measure so calculated as that was to heal the differ-
</p>
<p>ences which distracted and divided us ? Recollect Mr. O'Connell's
</p>
<p>language. He began this agitation himself, he says, long after the
</p>
<p>speech which he made in 1810. He commenced it a very short
</p>
<p>time after the passing of the Catholic Relief Bill. He says he always
</p>
<p>entertained these notions ; but that for a long time they were confined
</p>
<p>entirely to himself. He has thus arrogated to himself the exclusive
</p>
<p>merit of this agitation. But what is the inevitable and necessary con-
</p>
<p>sequence of it ? Is it possible that our country can be improved ; is it
</p>
<p>possible that wealth can flow to it ; is it possible that capital can be
</p>
<p>embarked here ; is it possible that " Saxons" and "strangers," who
</p>
<p>are said to " pollute our soil with their accursed foot," can be induced
</p>
<p>to embark their property in the improvement of the resources of this
</p>
<p>country ? Is it possible that persons can have the courage to venture
</p>
<p>amongst us, when they have read such speeches as I have, in the

</p>
<p>course of my address to you, been obliged to collect for your conside-
</p>
<p>ration? It is not to be expected; it cannot possibly be expected.
</p>
<p>Topics of this sort, I think, would be as well spared on both sides,
</p>
<p>because I freely admit they ought not to affect your verdict; and I
</p>
<p>confess I feel myself fettered by the rules within which, I admit
</p>
<p>freely, I think a counsel for the prosecution ought to confine himself,
</p>
<p>from going into a great number of observations, which, but for that
</p>
<p>consideration, I might very properly and naturally make, in reply to
</p>
<p>those offered by my learned opponents. But, when it is suggested to
</p>
<p>you, as an ingredient that ought to influence you in coming to a con-
</p>
<p>clusion as to the verdict you ought to find, that the state of this coun-
</p>
<p>try is poor; when this is urged as a justification, or palliation, of the
</p>
<p>adoption of these proceedings, I must be allowed to observe that I think
</p>
<p>the state of this country may, to a certain degree, be ascribed to the
</p>
<p>800
</p>
<p>existence of that very agitation, of which one of the traversers has
</p>
<p>admitted himself to be the sole original author.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, Mr. O'Connell's speech appears to me, as
</p>
<p>I have already stated, to be an admission of this charge, so far as re-
</p>
<p>lates to the facts. It appeared to me rather to be a speech in mitiga-
</p>
<p>gation, or excuse, than in justification of the course he admits himself
</p>
<p>to have pursued. Whether that course is legal or not, is the point
</p>
<p>on which he and we are at issue; I repeat here, what I had once or
</p>
<p>twice occasion to do in the course of my address to you, to prevent all
</p>
<p>misconception upon this subject, that I do not call upon you to find a
</p>
<p>verdict here, because of the consequences of that verdict, or from a
</p>
<p>feeling that it may be expedient, either with regard to the peace of
</p>
<p>the country, or otherwise, that there should be a verdict against these
</p>
<p>traversers. No, nor do I call upon you to find a verdict for the Crown,
</p>
<p>because the result of such a verdict may be to prevent the introduc-
</p>
<p>tion of any coercive measures. My observation with respect to
</p>
<p>coercive measures was addressed in answer to some made by the
</p>
<p>other side, that it was an unreasonable thing to resort to this mode
</p>
<p>of proceeding when Parliament was open. I do not call upon
</p>
<p>you for your verdict upon any such ground ; but I most confidently
</p>
<p>anticipate it at your hands, upon those grounds which ought to influ-
</p>
<p>ence all juries in all cases, namely, the law and the facts of the case.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, with regard to the law, their Lordships

<p>will direct you, and of course you will follow implicitly their guidance.
</p>
<p>Their Lordships will tell you, that conspiracy does not necessarily
</p>
<p>imply a secret proceeding ; that it does not necessarily imply, that
</p>
<p>every thing a conspirator does must be done in the dark, because a
</p>
<p>conspiracy may, from its very nature, be such (and this is one), that
</p>
<p>though the agreement may be concealed, although the illegal object
</p>
<p>be not avowed, yet the modes by which it is to be effected not only
</p>
<p>may be, but must be, open and undisguised. It may be impossible
</p>
<p>to carry into effect a conspiracy in a secret manner, so far as relates
</p>
<p>to the means of attaining its objects. Thus, in the present case, you
</p>
<p>cannot collect hundreds of thousands of people together secretly ; and,

</p>
<p>therefore, you may discard from your minds the notion that secrecy
</p>
<p>is necessary to constitute a conspiracy. Conspiracy is no more than
</p>
<p>this  it is the joint acting of two or more persons in a common de-
</p>
<p>sign which is unlawful, either because the end is unlawful for which
</p>
<p>they combine, or because, the end being lawful, they pursue that
</p>
<p>object by illegal means. Now, this being the law of the case, we have
</p>
<p>charged in our indictment, that there was (in that understanding of
</p>
<p>the word) a conspiracy, or, in other words, an illegal acting in con-
</p>
<p>cert by these defendants. Low is that made out? We find one
</p>
<p>presiding mind in the concoction of the whole; we find each and
</p>
<p>every of the traversers following out the purposes of that conspiracy
</p>
<p>or combination, so arranged, in his own particular department. We
</p>
<p>find the publisher of one paper inserting an article having this ob-
</p>
<p>ject, the publisher of another paper inserting an article having the
</p>
<p>same object, each of them tending to the common design. We find
</p>
<p>801
</p>
<p>meetings held, at which this person and that person of the traversers
</p>
<p>attend ; we find speeches made at each of those meetings ; we find
</p>
<p>the purposes for which those meetings were held, avowed. We find
</p>
<p>the thing carried on, regularly and systematically carried on from first
</p>
<p>to last, till at last the purposes are scarcely disguised ; till that which
</p>
<p>at first was, to a certain extent, secret and unknown, is so fully de-
</p>
<p>veloped, and so clearly expressed, if I may so say, that " he who runs
</p>
<p>may read." Have you the slightest doubt that that concert and
</p>
<p>agreement existed in this case in the year 1843? Have you the
</p>
<p>slightest doubt that there was an object here to terrify into the
</p>
<p>granting of this measure ; that there was an object to neutralize the
</p>
<p>army, if possible; that there was an object to disparage the adminis-
</p>
<p>tration of justice; that there was an object to create ill-will against
</p>
<p>the people of England; that there was an object to excite discontent
</p>
<p>and disatFection ; and that all these were so many means tending to
</p>
<p>a common end, in which common end, and in the use of which com-
</p>
<p>mon means, each and every one of the traversers at the bar was more
</p>
<p>or less engaged ?
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, this is compared to the movement in
</p>
<p>1782, when the Irish Volunteers stood forth and made the celebrated
</p>
<p>declaration which has been so often referred to. I arraign this
</p>
<p>as one of the many fallacies and deceptions, that have been syste-
</p>
<p>matically practised on the people of this country by the leaders of
</p>
<p>this Association. The state of things now is not what it was in 1782;
</p>
<p>far otherwise: and no man knows that better than Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>himself. In 1782 what was the state of things? An Act of Parliament
</p>
<p>was passed in England in the reign of George the First, Ireland having
</p>
<p>then her own Parliament, and that English Act of Parliament enact-
</p>
<p>ed, that it was competent to the English Legislature, in which the
</p>
<p>Irish people had no representatives  not a member  to make laws
</p>
<p>binding Ireland. Accordingly from that period of the sixth of George
</p>
<p>the First, down to 1782, that Statute was acquiesced in. It was
</p>
<p>contrary, no doubt, to constitutional principle ; to be sure it was.
</p>
<p>What is constitutional principle ? That there ought not to be govern-

</p>
<p>ment without representation ; the people ought not to be governed
</p>
<p>by a body, in the selection of whom, or part of whom, they have not
</p>
<p>a voice. It was contrary to all principles of justice, that the Irish
</p>
<p>people should be liable to be legislated for by the English Houses of
</p>
<p>Parliament, when they had not a right to return one member to the
</p>
<p>English House of Commons, which was thus to rule them. Accord-
</p>
<p>ingly, in 1782, there was a demonstration and a declaration, which
</p>
<p>has been made the foundation of the observations here on this Repeal
</p>
<p>card, "That no power on earth has, or ought to have, a right to bind
</p>
<p>" the people of Ireland, except the King, Lords, and Commons of
</p>
<p>" Ireland." In 1782 that was a constitutional and legal declaration,
</p>
<p>because there then existed a King, Lords, and Commons of Ireland.
</p>
<p>The effect of the Volunteers' declaration was no more than this, that
</p>
<p>it was not right or fair that a Legislature in which the Irish people
</p>
<p>had no voice, should have power to govern them, and that of right
</p>
<p>none should have that power except the King, Lords, and Commons
</p>
<p>5k
</p>
<p>802
</p>
<p>of Ireland. But to use that language in 1843, or 1844, when the
</p>
<p>Irish people have voices in the English Legislature, where they
</p>
<p>return a hundred members, and to tell the people in the present
</p>
<p>tense, that no power, in 1843, or 1844, has, or ought to have, a right
</p>
<p>to bind Ireland, except the King, Lords, and Commons of Ireland 
</p>
<p>to lay down that doctrine in 1843, and to justify it by analogy
</p>
<p>to a declaration of the Volunteers in 1782, is absurd in reasoning
</p>
<p>and illegal in principle. It is contrary to every principle, legal or
</p>
<p>constitutional ; it is seditious to hold such a doctrine at this day.
</p>
<p>It is neither more nor less than saying this  telling the people
</p>
<p>of Ireland (and this is the very first charge in the indictment),
</p>
<p>" you are legislated for, you are governed by a power that has
</p>
<p>no right to govern you." To hold out the declaration of the Vo-
</p>
<p>lunteers in 1782 as binding, or as to guide the people in 1843,
</p>
<p>is just saying this: " you are legislated for by a body that have no
</p>
<p>" right so to legislate ; no person has that power, and no body has
</p>
<p>" that power, but the Queen, Lords, and Commons of Ireland." I say,
</p>
<p>to lay down that doctrine in 1843 is unconstitutional, illegal, and se-
</p>
<p>ditious.
</p>
<p>Mr. Molyneux, who has been so often referred to, published his
</p>
<p>celebrated letter to vindicate the rights of the Irish people to have
</p>
<p>representatives in Parliament; and he says: " If from these last-
</p>
<p>*' mentioned records it be concluded that the Parliament of England
</p>
<p>" may bind Ireland, it must also be allowed that the people of Ire-
</p>
<p>" land ought to have their representatives in the Parliament of Eng-
</p>
<p>" land." That was the grievance against which the movement of
</p>
<p>1782 was directed ; and it is a mere pretext to take that as the basis
</p>
<p>of the present movement, which is directed, not against an unconsti-
</p>
<p>tutional exercise of authority over Ireland, but against the law and
</p>
<p>Constitution of this country, as by law established. Mr. Molyneux
</p>
<p>goes on, alluding to their having representatives in the Parliament of
</p>
<p>England: " And this, I believe," he says, " we should be willing
</p>
<p>enough to embrace, but this is an happiness we can hardly hope for."
</p>
<p>Mr. Molyneux's idea was, that the incorporation of the two Legislatures

</p>
<p>in one, was a happiness, for the sake of this country, which was hardly
</p>
<p>to be hoped for ; evidently showing that great man's notions of what
</p>
<p>would be desirable for the two countries in the way of legislation.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I thought it right to disabuse your minds
</p>
<p>from this notion, if any such impression has been made, that the par-
</p>
<p>ties engaged in this movement are doing no more than following the
</p>
<p>precedent set by some of the greatest men that have adorned this
</p>
<p>country. You will see at once, the wide distinction between the two
</p>
<p>cases ; and I think you can have no doubt, that the great men, whose
</p>
<p>names have been thus, I may say, profaned, never would have sanc-
</p>
<p>tioned a movement of this kind, which is neither more nor less than
</p>
<p>persuading the people of this country, that they are governed by
</p>
<p>persons who have no right to legislate for them, by strangers, by
</p>
<p>foreigners, by Saxons, by people who, from their earliest times, have
</p>
<p>had no other object in view but the conquest of their country, and
</p>
<p>keeping them in subjugation. The distinguished men to whom I
</p>
<p>803
</p>
<p>have alluded, would have been the last persons to countenance any
</p>
<p>thing of such a nature as this agitation.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I have to thank you for the very great
</p>
<p>attention which you have paid to me in the course of this protracted
</p>
<p>case. There are many topics suggested by it, on which I might di-
</p>
<p>late ; but I have been reminded by the counsel on the other side,
</p>
<p>and I fully accede to their view of the case, that it does not belong to
</p>
<p>me, in my function of public prosecutor, to go into them. But I his
</p>
<p>I must say, my learned friends and I, my colleagues who are with
</p>
<p>me, have endeavoured to bring this case forward before a jury, in
</p>
<p>the usual mode of administering justice by the common law, and upon
</p>
<p>the only charge, and in the only way by which the offence, which we
</p>
<p>say exists, is legally cognizable. I think I may claim credit for our
</p>
<p>having conducted the case temperately and fairly. I hope I may also
</p>
<p>say, that there never was in the history of our jurisprudence a trial in
</p>
<p>which a more wide latitude was allowed to the persons on trial. Not
</p>
<p>a single topic has been objected to ; not a single declaration of any
</p>
<p>of the parties, not a single act at any period of his life has been ex-
</p>
<p>cluded ; not a single legal objection has been started by us to the
</p>
<p>reception of any evidence which the defendant's counsel thought
</p>
<p>might bear upon the case. Some of the most distinguished men at
</p>
<p>our bar have been selected for the defence ; they have been heard
</p>
<p>at great length ; they have put forward the cases of their respective
</p>
<p>clients with the most consummate ability. Every advantage in that
</p>
<p>respect has been afforded to the traversers ; and, with all those ad-
</p>
<p>vantages, what has been the case which has been presented to you
</p>
<p>on their behalf? Are you at this moment, any one of you, able to
</p>
<p>understand what the object of the several traversers was, if it was not
</p>
<p>what we say it was ? Has any one of them, has the counsel of any
</p>
<p>one of them shown, or even asserted, what his real object was ?
</p>
<p>Has any one of them suggested any legal, any constitutional, any
</p>
<p>peaceable mode, by which the object which they say they had in
</p>
<p>view could be arrived at ? Not one. Has any attempt been shown
</p>
<p>to resort to any legal or constitutional mode of effecting it ? Not

</p>
<p>one. Has any witness been called to contradict the facts proved
</p>
<p>against them ? Not one. A case more wholly devoid of defence
</p>
<p>it is impossible, I think, to imagine.
</p>
<p>Then, Gentlemen of the Jury, what remains ? What remains
</p>
<p>but this, that you should ask yourselves, is not the case of some
</p>
<p>common plan clearly developed, clearly shown? Are not the tra-
</p>
<p>versers more or less engaged in that common plan ? Is it a lawful
</p>
<p>one ? Has it been shown to us to be lawful ? Has it been asserted
</p>
<p>to be lawful? Has even the principal traverser, who all along said it
</p>
<p>was lawful, shown it to be so ? I think you can have no doubt in
</p>
<p>saying, that, on the contrary, it has been clearly shown to be unlaw-
</p>
<p>ful. The only remaining consideration is, how far the persons upon
</p>
<p>trial have embarked in this illegal design. With respect to the
</p>
<p>principal traverser, I think it is unnecessary to make any further
</p>
<p>observations. With regard to those who assisted him, by the pub-
</p>
<p>lications in the newspapers, I presume not the slightest doubt will
</p>
<p>be entertained. With regard to Mr. Steele, the Idus Achates,
</p>
<p>804
</p>
<p>who has himself avowed here the sentiments I read from his
</p>
<p>speech, and who has identified himself with Mr. O'Connell, I
</p>
<p>should presume there can be no doubt. Then, there remains Mr.
</p>
<p>Tierney, who, on two occasions did, certainly in his language,
</p>
<p>and by the communications which he appears himself to have ad-
</p>
<p>mitted he had with Dublin, identified himself with the objects of
</p>
<p>the several conspirators, for so I must now call them. And
</p>
<p>with regard to Mr. Ray, he is clearly a member of the Association ;
</p>
<p>he is the person who appears to have conducted the finance depart-
</p>
<p>ment. It was said that something would be shown with regard to
</p>
<p>the application of the funds of that body ; I do not know whether
</p>
<p>that was intended to be a pledge, but 1 would merely make this re-
</p>
<p>mark, that not an explanation has been given on the part of these tra-
</p>
<p>versers, either of the application of these funds, or of the real object
</p>
<p>which the parties had in view. How could that be testified ? By re-
</p>
<p>solutions in their books ; by communications with their officers ; by
</p>
<p>accounts of the application of their money; by officers or persons pro-
</p>
<p>duced, who would be able to say : " We are acquainted with the de-
</p>
<p>tails of this machinery, and will tell you what the object is." Not a
</p>
<p>single individual of that description is brought forward ; the greatest
</p>
<p>caution has been observed in keeping them back. I do not say that
</p>
<p>it is incumbent upon persons who are charged with offence and crime,
</p>
<p>to come forward and vindicate themselves till they are implicated by
</p>
<p>evidence; I do not mean to say, that this Association is bound, at the
</p>
<p>bidding of the Crown, or merely on being prosecuted, to come for-
</p>
<p>ward and show you what the real nature of their constitution is. I
</p>
<p>do not say that; but when I find the persons connected with that
</p>
<p>Association conducting themselves in such a way, as clearly to bring
</p>
<p>themselves within the law ; and when it is said on the other side,
</p>
<p>" We are not violating the law, but keeping within the limits of it ;"
</p>
<p>I think I have a right to say to them, show me by evidence, which I
</p>
<p>know is in your power, what your objects really are, or how far they
</p>
<p>have gone, and to what they tend. I do not profess to know in what
</p>
<p>state we might have been at this moment, but for the stopping of these

</p>
<p>proceedings in the month of October. You will recollect, the last
</p>
<p>time we heard Mr. O'Connell speaking, before the commencement of
</p>
<p>this prosecution, he says to the people, " I have one or two more steps
</p>
<p>which I shall not at present disclose." He doles out his information to
</p>
<p>the assembled multitudes, piece by piece, as he finds occasion will justi-
</p>
<p>fy ; you find there is a regular scheme in progress and concoction, but it
</p>
<p>is not until he conceives the other machinery sufficiently perfect, that
</p>
<p>the head of the combination thinks fit to disclose what it is. I will not
</p>
<p>at present say what might have been the consequences to the persons
</p>
<p>connected with this movement, if three hundred persons had assem-
</p>
<p>bled in the month of January or February, and had taken upon them
</p>
<p>the functions, either of representatives or delegates of the people, of
</p>
<p>different counties and places in Ireland, or erected themselves into a
</p>
<p>body for the purpose of opening what is called a negotiation with the
</p>
<p>British Minister. What "negotiation" means, I do not understand;
</p>
<p>my learned friend, Mr. Shell, says, that the agitator must sometimes
</p>
<p>805
</p>
<p>be a diplomatist, and that in order to get what is practicable, it is
</p>
<p>sometimes a prudent thing to ask for what is unattainable. This was
</p>
<p>Mr. Shell's language in a part of his speech ; whether " negotiation"
</p>
<p>means that or not, it is not for me to say ; but if he does mean, as it
</p>
<p>may mean, a threat and denunciation to the British Minister, that
</p>
<p>things were now come to that pass, that he must not think any longer
</p>
<p>of refusing the Repeal of the Union, then the conspiracy was com-
</p>
<p>plete, which we charge to have progressed to a certain extent  that
</p>
<p>conspiracy being to accomplish its object by intimidation.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I hope I have satisfied you, that in point
</p>
<p>of law, so far as the law is for you, there is a conspiracy in this case, in
</p>
<p>the legal signification of the word. Not a secret combination, to be
</p>
<p>proved by any person who has been a party to it  otherwise we must
</p>
<p>resort to common informers and spies  but a community of purpose,
</p>
<p>and illegal purpose, which is enough to constitute the crime of con-
</p>
<p>spiracy in point of law. And that was the only mode, observe, of
</p>
<p>dealing with this case ; because it would not have done to have con-
</p>
<p>victed Mr. Duffy of the publication of a libel, or Mr. Barrett of the
</p>
<p>publication of a libel, or even Mr. O'Connell for the uttering of a se-
</p>
<p>ditious speech. That would not have done ; the great question which
</p>
<p>we want to have tried is, the legality of these proceedings, and of this
</p>
<p>body. The only mode by which that could be done, is by bringing
</p>
<p>the leaders of it in one mass or focus, and by charging those leaders
</p>
<p>with having violated the law. That is the meaning of conspiracy ;
</p>
<p>that is the mode we have manfully and boldly adopted. We have not
</p>
<p>gone to the inferior agents, and put into prison this person or that per-
</p>
<p>son, who had acted a subordinate part ; nor have we prosecuted the
</p>
<p>unfortunate people who were collected together by the machinery of
</p>
<p>Repeal Wardens, for attending illegal meetings. No ; we have at once
</p>
<p>joined issue with Mr. O'Connell, and we have said : " We will take the
</p>
<p>" opinion of a court of law, we will take the opinion of a jury,
</p>
<p>" whether what you say is or is not true, that all these proceedings are
</p>
<p>" consistent with the law." This is the course we have adopted ;
</p>
<p>and, therefore, we are not to be taunted with having adopted the con-

</p>
<p>trivance of prosecuting for conspiracy, or with having brought the
</p>
<p>actions of one man to bear upon another. No ; but having demon-
</p>
<p>strated each of these persons to have pursued a particular line of
</p>
<p>conduct, for which line of conduct he must be answerable, if the re-
</p>
<p>sult of that conduct be to show, not only that he may have in the
</p>
<p>particular instance violated the law, as, for instance, in the publication
</p>
<p>of a libel, but also to show that he has identified himself with a body,
</p>
<p>with a combination, with a movement that is illegal, we do not visit
</p>
<p>that man with the guilt of another, but we visit on him the legal and
</p>
<p>inevitable consequences of his own act, and fasten upon him the re-
</p>
<p>sponsibility consequent upon his own guilt.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I have now brought to a close the ob-
</p>
<p>servations which it has occurred to me to make on the evidence in
</p>
<p>this case. I have not the slightest doubt, that as we have so far dis-
</p>
<p>charged our duty, and, I trust, in a manner temperate and fair to the
</p>
<p>traversers, and have allowed them the indulgence they have had in
</p>
<p>806
</p>
<p>this trial  as we have done our duty to the best of our ability in that
</p>
<p>way, so I have no doubt that you will fearlessly and impartially dis-
</p>
<p>charge yours. I call upon you for your verdict ; not because this
</p>
<p>country is in a state of disturbance, not because that verdict may
</p>
<p>tend one way or other to act upon the state of the country, not be-
</p>
<p>cause it may be attended with this or that consequence, either to the
</p>
<p>public or to individuals, not because it may be productive of this or
</p>
<p>that effect with regard to legislative enactment ; no, but that ver-
</p>
<p>dict I call upon you to give, which the law, the justice, the uncon-
</p>
<p>tradicted and unexplained evidence in this case demand.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, it now falls to me to make such observa-
</p>
<p>tions as occur to me, to be submitted to your consideration upon the
</p>
<p>manifold circumstances of this very important case; and I am happy
</p>
<p>to say, that on conference with my learned Brethren of the Bench,
</p>
<p>there is a concurrence of opinion existing between us upon the sub-
</p>
<p>ject matter which I shall have to lay before you. Gentlemen, it has
</p>
<p>been, and, is most highly satisfactory to the Court, most creditable
</p>
<p>to you, the unvaried and constant attention which you have paid
</p>
<p>throughout, from beginning to end, to the circumstances of this strange
</p>
<p>and important case. I say strange, only in reference to its duration ;
</p>
<p>because for myself I do not feel that it is a case, in which there exists
</p>
<p>any great difficulty in the law, or upon the facts on which so intelligent
</p>
<p>a jury as I have now the honour of addressing, will finally have to
</p>
<p>pronounce their verdict.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you have heard during this long trial a great deal of
</p>
<p>eloquence  brilliant eloquence; you have heard somewhat also of de-
</p>
<p>clamation ; you have heard great oratorical powers, and powers of rea-
</p>
<p>soning ; you have heard a great deal of what may be deemed poetic ;
</p>
<p>and I do not. mean to say but that you have also heard a good deal of
</p>
<p>what might be more justly termed prosaic. Gentlemen, you have heard
</p>
<p>observations made to you, which, I cannot help saying generally, bor-
</p>
<p>dered upon the very verge of propriety. But what is more material,
</p>
<p>you have heard a great deal, which it would be very difficult indeed to

</p>
<p>prove was properly relevant to the subject which you are to decide on.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, there are many questions made both of law and of fact.
</p>
<p>On the latter subject you are the constitutional judges. The law of the
</p>
<p>case you will take from the Court, the Judges of which are constitu-
</p>
<p>tionally entrusted with the administration of that law, bound to adminis-
</p>
<p>ter it under the most solemn sanctions, and independent alike both of the
</p>
<p>Crown and of the people. We, the Judges, therefore, sit here in this
</p>
<p>Court of Queen's Bench, under the same obligation as the Queen holds
</p>
<p>her Crown, to administer justice with mercy according to the laws of the
</p>
<p>land.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, there are, as you know, eight traversers now upon their
</p>
<p>807
</p>
<p>trial: Mr. Daniel O'Connell, Mr. John O'Connell, Mr. Thomas
</p>
<p>Stpele, Mr. Thomas Matthew Ray, Mr. Charles Gavan Duffy, .the
</p>
<p>Reverend Thomas Tierney, Dr. John Gray, and Mr. Richard Barret.
</p>
<p>Those are, Gentlemen, the several traversers upon their trial ; andj-here
</p>
<p>is an abstract of the indictment, upon which they are charged, and to
</p>
<p>which they have respectively pleaded Not Guilty. They are indicted for
</p>
<p>conspiring to raise and create discontent and disaffection amongst the
</p>
<p>Queen's subjects. The particulars, Gentlemen, of the alleged objects
</p>
<p>of this conspiracy it is very material for you to keep in mind : perhaps
</p>
<p>you may find, in coming to your verdict, the necessity of distinguishing
</p>
<p>with regard to the several traversers, or some of them, in respect of
</p>
<p>the nature of the conspiracy which is charged against one and all of
</p>
<p>them. The first, then, is for conspiring to raise and create discontent
</p>
<p>and disaffection amongst the Queen's subjects, and to excite to hatred
</p>
<p>and unlawful opposition to the Government and Constitution of the
</p>
<p>realm. The second is, conspiring to stir up jealousies amongst the
</p>
<p>Queen's subjects, and to promote ill-will to other subjects of the Queen,
</p>
<p>especially with regard to Ireland against England. The third is, to
</p>
<p>excite disaffection in the army. The fourth is, to collect unlawful as-
</p>
<p>semblies in large numbers in Ireland, in order to obtain changes in the
</p>
<p>laws and constitution, by intimidation and demonstration of force. The
</p>
<p>fifth is, to bring the Courts of Justice established by law into disrepute,
</p>
<p>and with the intention to induce the subjects of Her Majesty to submit
</p>
<p>their disputes to other tribunals, and to induce the Queen's subjects to
</p>
<p>withdraw the settlement of their disputes from the tribunals by law estab-
</p>
<p>lished, and to resort to other modes of adjudication. The latter is rather
</p>
<p>a repetition of the previous object of conspiracy, and we may say the last
</p>
<p>object is to bring the Courts of Justice established by law into disrepute,
</p>
<p>and with the intention to induce the subjects to submit their disputes to
</p>
<p>other tribunals. Now, Gentlemen, what I have stated to you is con-
</p>
<p>tained in an indictment consisting of eleven counts ; the first count, con-
</p>
<p>taining all the several charges of conspiracy that I have enumerated to
</p>
<p>you, accompanied with divers overt acts, or means by which those objects
</p>
<p>were to be carried into effect. These overt acts are not part of the con-

</p>
<p>spiracy, but they are inserted in the count, and in the indictment, as
</p>
<p>statements of the evidence by which the charge of conspiracy is to be
</p>
<p>supported ; for the purpose, and the laudable purpose, of giving the par-
</p>
<p>ties who are accused of the conspiracy, notice of the particular facts, by
</p>
<p>Avhich the Crown intend to support their charge of the conspiracy in ques-
</p>
<p>tion. Now, these overt acts are only evidence; and the question is not so
</p>
<p>much as to the existence of the particular overt acts named, as the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy of which they are stated as the evidence. But it is not upon the
</p>
<p>fact of the evidence, but upon its result, that you will have to decide ;
</p>
<p>and you will have to say, not whether the overt acts took place, but
</p>
<p>whether the parties accused are guilty of the conspiracy. Now you
</p>
<p>see, it is very important in the outset, that you should take and store up
</p>
<p>in your minds a very clear and distinct idea of the particulars of the
</p>
<p>alleged conspiracy. It is as I have stated to you, or it may be said to
</p>
<p>808
</p>
<p>"be, consisting of five parts ; I will go over the charges again, because
</p>
<p>it is very necessary that these matters should be kept distinct in your
</p>
<p>minds. The first is, to create discontent and disaffection amongst the
</p>
<p>Queen's subjects, and to excite them to hatred and unlawful opposition
</p>
<p>to the Government and Constitution of the country. The second is, to
</p>
<p>stir up jealousies amongst the Queen's subjects, and to promote ill-will
</p>
<p>from one class of the subjects against another, especially from Ireland
</p>
<p>against England. The third, to excite disaffection in the army. The
</p>
<p>fourth, to collect unlawful assemblies in large numbers in Ireland, in
</p>
<p>order to obtain changes in the laws and constitution by intimidation and
</p>
<p>demonstration of physical force. The last to bring the Courts of Jus-
</p>
<p>tice established by law into disrepute, and with the intent to induce the
</p>
<p>subjects of the realm to submit their disputes to other tribunals.
</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen, it is a conceded fact in this case, that the indict-
</p>
<p>ment upon which the traversers are brought to trial, and to which they
</p>
<p>have pleaded, consists only of an offence of one nature ; that is to say,
</p>
<p>it may have different branches, as I have already stated this indictment
</p>
<p>has, but still, as a whole, it is an indictment for a conspiracy, and
</p>
<p>nothing else. There is no indictment against any of the traversers for
</p>
<p>a libel ; there is no indictment against any of the traversers for sedition,
</p>
<p>nor for any other unconnected, separate, and distinct breach of the law.
</p>
<p>They are one and all indicted for the crime of conspiracy, of which no
</p>
<p>individual can by law be convicted, unless it be proved to the satis-
</p>
<p>faction of a jury that he has been acting in the illegal charge set
</p>
<p>against him in concert with some other person. A single person,
</p>
<p>an individual, cannot per se, without joining in concert with somebody
</p>
<p>else, commit the crime of conspiracy. He may be guilty of a nume-
</p>
<p>rous class of offences individually, as men daily are ; but for the convic-
</p>
<p>tion of one or more persons for a conspiracy, the law requires that the
</p>
<p>jury should be satisfied and convinced that there was concert between
</p>
<p>two or more, either for the purpose of doing an illegal act, or else for the
</p>
<p>purpose of doing or causing to be done an act legal in itself, but to be
</p>
<p>brought about by illegal means. Now, Gentlemen, I take that to be
</p>
<p>the definition of a conspiracy, which according to law I can, not only

</p>
<p>safely, but which I am bound to put to you. Gentlemen, you see in
</p>
<p>that definition I do not include, as a component part of that crime of
</p>
<p>conspiracy, either the existence of treachery, as was insisted on by Mr.
</p>
<p>Fitzgibbon on the first day of his address to you, or the existence of se-
</p>
<p>crecy, which was insisted upon on the second day that he addressed you,
</p>
<p>and which was afterwards repeated by Mr. O'Connell the traverser,
</p>
<p>when he addressed you, as he had a right to do, in his own defence. Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, in my opinion, and in the opinion of the Court, it is a mistake in
</p>
<p>law to say, that in order to establish conspiracy it is necessary for the
</p>
<p>Crown or prosecutor to prove the existence either of treachery or of se-
</p>
<p>crecy, in order to complete this charge. I do not mean to say, but rather
</p>
<p>the contrary, that very often both treachery and secrecy do not concur
</p>
<p>in the existence of various conspiracies; they are cognate to such an of-
</p>
<p>fence ; but I deny altogether, that it is the law of this country that the
</p>
<p>existence of one or other of such ingredients should be proved in order to
</p>
<p>constitute the crime of conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, by a sort of common notion  I do not very
</p>
<p>well know how to designate it  a sort of disagreeable name, or disa-
</p>
<p>greeable idea, has connected itself with the term conspiracy. Perhaps
</p>
<p>it may be found in Johnson s Dictionary, from which Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>took it; perhaps it may be found in some common, ordinary book, from
</p>
<p>whence Mr. Fitzgibbon derived his notion of treachery. I say, Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, that in common parlance something of a disreputable idea, bor-
</p>
<p>dering upon infamous, as was alleged by the traversers and their counsel,
</p>
<p>has been attached to the term conspiracy ; from whence you were very
</p>
<p>much called upon to beware, and ponder, before you find the traversers,
</p>
<p>or any of them, guilty of an infamous crime. Now, though infamy may,
</p>
<p>and often does connect itself with the charge of conspiracy, yet, I am
</p>
<p>bound to say, that it does not fall within the legal definition of it. A
</p>
<p>conspiracy may exist, and men may be guilty of a conspiracy, without
</p>
<p>having been guiltvofthe vice or crime of treachery, and without those
</p>
<p>deeds of darkness, which Mr. Sheil insisted were necessary, and formed
</p>
<p>a constituent part of the crime of conspiracy. Secrecy is very often in-
</p>
<p>volved in it ; but in my opinion, and so I put it to you, it is not a necessary
</p>
<p>ingredient in the charge of conspiracy. Nay, more, if it were necessary,
</p>
<p>I should say this farther  (and I do not mean to say this, anticipating
</p>
<p>one way or the other  God forbid  what conclusion you may come to
</p>
<p>upon the subject)  if secrecy was a necessary ingredient in the crime
</p>
<p>of conspiracy, the present alleged conspiracy might have been carried on
</p>
<p>from its beginning to its final consummation, and the parties could never
</p>
<p>have been stopped in their progress, or charged with the crime of that
</p>
<p>nature. I put it rather now by way of example, than as bearing upon the
</p>
<p>present case ; and I desire that in what I have said, it may be rejected
</p>
<p>from your minds altogether as if I Mere giving any thing like an opinion,
</p>
<p>or any thing bordering upon an opinion, with regard to the facts of this
</p>
<p>case, which will be for your final decision. But 1 am putting it in the
</p>
<p>way of exemplification. Secrecy is not necessary. If the parties con-
</p>
<p>spired  that is, agreed together, upon a common illegal intent and design,
</p>
<p>to overawe the Parliament of the country, to cause alarm and terror

</p>
<p>amongst Her Majesty's subjects, by collecting together in the open day
</p>
<p>large bodies of the people, the more numerous, the more public, the more
</p>
<p>likely the means would be to accomplish the end of the parties who called "
</p>
<p>them together, and forming part of the crime with which they are
</p>
<p>charged, their object being to create terror, intimidation, and over-
</p>
<p>awing, which would be brought about more by public demonstration
</p>
<p>than by secrecy or concealment. Therefore, I put that as an instance
</p>
<p>to show the fallacp of those who have insisted and required, that as
</p>
<p>a necessary ingredient in the charge of conspiracy, there should be
</p>
<p>established, to the satisfaction of the Jury, the existence of secrecy.
</p>
<p>A great many authorities were cited by Mr. Fitzgibbon in his argu-
</p>
<p>ment, both upon the first day, when he insisted upon the existence of
</p>
<p>treachery, and on the second dav, when he insisted also, or perhaps
</p>
<p>5L
</p>
<p>810
</p>
<p>in the alternative, upon the existence of secrecy. I have looked into
</p>
<p>those authorities, and I am bound to say that they do not support the pro-
</p>
<p>position for which he brought them forward ; and I would say further,
</p>
<p>that I am somewhat surprised at the statement which he made with re-
</p>
<p>gard to some of the cases to which he referred, as if they contained any
</p>
<p>ground for the introduction of any such proposition ; 1 have looked care-
</p>
<p>fully through them all, and without troubling you with a recapitulation
</p>
<p>of those several cases, I am bound to say, that in my judgment, and in
</p>
<p>the opinion of the Court, there is not one of them which supports the pro-
</p>
<p>position for which they were cited, that in order to substantiate the charge
</p>
<p>of conspiracy either treachery or secrecy is necessary. The definition
</p>
<p>of conspiracy I have already stated to you as we hold the law to be, is
</p>
<p>the mutual concert of two or more to bring about an end illegal in itself,
</p>
<p>or an end abstractly legal in itself, but to be brought about by illegal
</p>
<p>means. That is a conspiracy. That you see, will include within it,
</p>
<p>wherever they exist, treachery, or secrecy, but they are not necessary or
</p>
<p>essential ingredients in the existence of conspiracy. But Mr. Fitzgibbon
</p>
<p>insisted, that the definition which I have given of conspiracy has been
</p>
<p>found fault with or overruled, in a case to which he referred, by Lord
</p>
<p>Denman, the Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench in England  the per-
</p>
<p>son who is alleged to have first introduced the definition of conspiracy,
</p>
<p>such as I now lay it down to you. Now I beg leave to say to Mr. Fitz-
</p>
<p>gibbon, that it does not appear that Lord Denman ever did any such
</p>
<p>thing ; and, moreover, that the rule or definition which Lord Denman
</p>
<p>gave, has been the rule and definition adopted and followed not only by
</p>
<p>Lord Denman, but by a variety of successive Judges in the different
</p>
<p>Courts of England, giving judicially their judgment upon the subject.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon said, that Lord Denman, in the case in which he had
</p>
<p>laid down that rule, was not acting judicially, and he said that what he
</p>
<p>did say was therefore an obiter dictum, or an ipse dixit. Those are
</p>
<p>the terms he made use of: obiter dictum, that is, inconsiderately  not
</p>
<p>necessary to determine the particular point ; or ipse dixit  the perso-
</p>
<p>nal opinion of Lord Denman, not supported by any body else. That is
</p>
<p>the plain meaning of these words. Now it so happens that in the case to

</p>
<p>which he referred, the case in which the rule was originally mentioned
</p>
<p>by Lord Denman, which is in 1st Adolphus & Ellis, 715, he not
</p>
<p>only did not lay down that rule extrajudicially, as an obiter dictum,
</p>
<p>nor singly and unsupported by other Judges, but he stated that rule judi-
</p>
<p>cially  the very foundation of his judgment, and given in the most delibe-
</p>
<p>rate manner ; and so far from being unsupported by the opinion of other
</p>
<p>Judges, the other Judges then in the Court of Queen's Bench all con-
</p>
<p>curred with Lord Denman, not only in the judgment that he gave, but
</p>
<p>also in repeating that rule which he laid down, and adopting it as the
</p>
<p>foundation of their judgment. So far with regard to the statement of its
</p>
<p>being ipse dixit. But it is not only so : because the same circumstances
</p>
<p>happened in several other cases, in which it became necessary to consi-
</p>
<p>der the law of conspiracy, and judicial opinions were pronounced from
</p>
<p>the Bench severally and seriatim, given by each individual Judge, in
</p>
<p>811
</p>
<p>which they, one and all, concurred in the justice of the rule, and pro-
</p>
<p>nounced their judgments in the respective cases according to that com-
</p>
<p>mon opinion  not an ipse dixit. The same rule was laid down, I
</p>
<p>believe, before Lord Denman's time, by the late Lord Chief Justice of
</p>
<p>this country in the case of the Queen v. Forbes; and he also, and the
</p>
<p>Court of Queen's Bench in this country also, adopted the same rule in
</p>
<p>the precise same terms. And moreover, that same rule, in the very
</p>
<p>self-same terms, has been made use of and adopted by the Courts of law
</p>
<p>in England up to the last volume of Carrington & Payne, the ninth
</p>
<p>volume, which I believe is the last of those Reporters. The only impu-
</p>
<p>tation (and here is the mistake into which Mr. Fitzgibbon fell) that ever
</p>
<p>was cast by Lord Denman upon that rule, was this. The rule was
</p>
<p>cited to him, in the progress of an argument, by Mr. Carrington, a
</p>
<p>gentleman of the English bar, and he stated the rule to be, as 1 have
</p>
<p>stated it to you  a conspiracy is either an agreement of two or more
</p>
<p>persons in a design to do, or procure to be done, an unlawful act, or a
</p>
<p>lawful act by unlawful means. " I," says Lord Denman, " doubt the
</p>
<p>correctness of that antithesis." That is the whole of what Lord Denman
</p>
<p>said, which is brought forward and cited in this Court, as giving Lord
</p>
<p>Denman's deliberate judgment against all the concurrent judgments
</p>
<p>both of himself and all the other English Judges before whom the ques-
</p>
<p>tion came : "1 doubt the correctness of that antithesis." Every body
</p>
<p>knows Lord Denman to be a most learned scholar  an accurate scholar ;
</p>
<p>and what he meant by that was, as a grammarian, I think an exception
</p>
<p>might be taken to that antithesis. That is the whole of it. But it does
</p>
<p>not in the slightest degree alter the law upon the subject ; it leaves the
</p>
<p>law precisely as it found it ; and therefore it is that all Judges in Eng-
</p>
<p>land before whom the question has ever since come (and the question
</p>
<p>has occurred very often), have reiterated and re-stated the existence of
</p>
<p>the same rule, and have acted upon it accordingly. Mr. Fitzgibbon
</p>
<p>the first day, with a good deal of seriousness, perhaps I might say solem-
</p>
<p>nity, announced the law not to be as I have stated it to you ; and he
</p>
<p>found fault with his friend Mr. Moore, who is for another traverser in
</p>
<p>the same interest with him, for having admitted the law as the Attorney-

</p>
<p>General had stated it, from whom he had taken that definition ; and he
</p>
<p>said with an earnestness to excite your attention, that that was not the
</p>
<p>law, for that by the law as existing so long ago as the reign of Edward
</p>
<p>the First, nothing could be a conspiracy but within a certain definition
</p>
<p>set out in an old Act of Parliament, at that time, from whence it could
</p>
<p>be inferred nothing was conspiracy except an unlawful association of
</p>
<p>men bound together by oath or other illegal obligation, for the purpose
</p>
<p>of imposing a false crime, a false accusation upon another man, or some-
</p>
<p>thing to the same effect. And he referred to a passage in Hawkins, as
</p>
<p>stating that to be the law of conspiracy. Now, if that were the law of
</p>
<p>conspiracy, it would not have supported Mr. Fitzgibbon. What he
</p>
<p>was then insisting upon, was the existence of treachery ; there would not
</p>
<p>necessarily have been treachery, in the rule as he so stated it, as laid down
</p>
<p>by Hawkins, and taken from the Act of Parliament in the reign of Ed-
</p>
<p>812
</p>
<p>Ward the First. That was stated by him from 1st Hawkins, 4-1 J ;
</p>
<p>but he forgot to add to that, that in two pages after, page 446, Mr. Cur-
</p>
<p>wood, a gentleman at the bar, who published the last edition of Hawkins
</p>
<p>(from which Mr. Fitzgibbon had taken his quotation), stated thus : " mo-
</p>
<p>dern cases," says Mr. Curwood, " have certainly stretched the doctrine of
</p>
<p>conspiracy far beyond the old rule of law, in the opinion of Lord Ellen-
</p>
<p>borough not to be pushed farther," was an observation made by him, when
</p>
<p>a case was brought before him, of an accusation of conspiracy against two
</p>
<p>or more persons for attempting to wire hares in a gentleman's preserve ;
</p>
<p>that of course was carrying the law too far, and, according to Lord Ellen-
</p>
<p>borough, thatis too much. " Formerly the offence was considered to con-
</p>
<p>" sistin a combination to impose a false crime uponany person; or in other
</p>
<p>" words, to convict an innocent person by perversion of the law and by per-
</p>
<p>" jury." But, Gentlemen, he states, very properly, thatthe ancient law has
</p>
<p>longsince been extended far beyond the cases to which it was then applied,
</p>
<p>namely, in the reign of Edward the First. I need not go through the
</p>
<p>multiplicity of cases, in which that extension of the rule of law has been
</p>
<p>established ; acted on by courts of justice, by the unanimous opinions of
</p>
<p>judges, and never questioned, in order to establish from whence the rule,
</p>
<p>as now laid down, is deduced, namely, in the general way in which I
</p>
<p>began by stating it, and in which I give it. It is by no means necessary,
</p>
<p>that treachery or secrecy should, one or either of them, form an ingre-
</p>
<p>dient in the charge of conspiracy, as the law now looks upon it. Now I
</p>
<p>believe, Gentlemen, I have told you you are to take the law from the
</p>
<p>Court ; and having thus told you explicitly what the law of conspiracy is
</p>
<p>not, and what it is, I forbear troubling you with cases upon the subject,
</p>
<p>upon which I and the rest of my brethren with me have come to the con-
</p>
<p>clusion I have stated.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, having thus stated to you what it is the tra-
</p>
<p>versers are accused of, I think it would be right for me also to lay down
</p>
<p>a few other rules with regard to conspiracy, that you may hereafter see
</p>
<p>their proper bearing upon this case.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, in order to convict the traversers, or any of them, of the
</p>
<p>charge of conspiracy, it is necessary that you should be satisfied  I do not

<p>mean that you should have ground to surmise, but that you should have
</p>
<p>such evidence before you as to convince your consciences  that they, or
</p>
<p>some of them, did respectively, and in common, combine or agree to do
</p>
<p>an unlawful act; Avhether that act be unlawful in itself in its original
</p>
<p>design, or whether it became so by the unlawful means by which it was
</p>
<p>agreed that it should be brought about. That is one observation.
</p>
<p>Another observation is this : that to constitute the crime of conspiracy, it
</p>
<p>is not necessary that the unlawful thing agreed mutually to be done
</p>
<p>should be effected. The crime of conspiracy is complete, though in
</p>
<p>point of fact the criminal end was never attained. Another point I
</p>
<p>would lay down would be this : that if you be satisfied that an unlawful
</p>
<p>agreement has taken place, of the nature that I have stated, either to do
</p>
<p>an act unlawful in itself, or to cause that to be done by unlawful means,
</p>
<p>though the act itself, per sq, should not be criminal; if you be once satis-
</p>
<p>813
</p>
<p>fied tltal such an agreement, a criminal agreement, has taken place, from
</p>
<p>thenceforward the acts of each one associated in this conspiracy, are re-
</p>
<p>ciprocally evidence against the other of them, if conducing to the same
</p>
<p>criminal end, though it be not proved that each and all of the several
</p>
<p>conspirators have either participated in each individual act, or although
</p>
<p>it be not proved that each and every of the several parties charged with
</p>
<p>the conspiracy have been guilty of the perpetration of any particular act
</p>
<p>towards the common illegal end. I will go farther, Gentlemen, and
</p>
<p>lay down another rule for you. " It is not necessary,"  and I am now
</p>
<p>using the language of a very eminent English Judge in one of the late
</p>
<p>trials, a trial that took place in the year 18.37, in giving his charge to the
</p>
<p>Jury,  " It is not necessary that it should be proved, that the several par-
</p>
<p>" ties charged with the common conspiracy met to concoct this scheme ;
</p>
<p>" nor is it necessary that they should have originated it. The very fact of
</p>
<p>" the meeting to concoctthecommonillegalagreement,itisnotnecessary
</p>
<p>" should be absolutely proved to you ; it is enough, and you are to say
</p>
<p>" whether, from the acts that have been proved, you are satisfied that these
</p>
<p>" defendants were acting in concert in this matter. If you are satisfied
</p>
<p>" that there was a concert between them, that is, an illegal concert, I
</p>
<p>" am bound to say, that being convinced of the conspiracy, it is not neces-
</p>
<p>" sary that you should find both the traversers doing each particular act, as
</p>
<p>" afterthefactofaconspiracy is once established in your minds, whatever
</p>
<p>" is either said or done by either of the defendants in pursuance of the
</p>
<p>" common design, is both in law and in common sense to be considered as
</p>
<p>" the act of both." I may lay down another rule, which you will also
</p>
<p>bear in mind, as bearing perhaps more particularly upon the instance of
</p>
<p>the Reverend Mr. Tierney, than of any body else. " It is not necessary
</p>
<p>" that it should be proved that these defendants met to concoct this
</p>
<p>" scheme, nor is it necessary that they should have originated it." It is
</p>
<p>said that Mr. Tierney did not join the Association until the 3rd of Oc-
</p>
<p>tober; "if a conspiracy be already formed, and a person joins it afterwards,
</p>
<p>he is equally guilty." Certainly, he is equally guilty, if he adopts the al-
</p>
<p>ready formed conspiracy, as it then stood. I do not think it necessary,
</p>
<p>though I do not by any means impugn the doctrine of Judge Coleridge,

</p>
<p>in the general way in which he laid down that proposition ; but you will
</p>
<p>have to decide the question whether or not Mr. Tierney, who does not
</p>
<p>appear to have joined the Association until the 3rd of October, is or is
</p>
<p>not to be visited with the previous acts of that Association, it will be for
</p>
<p>you to say  and I would put this to you upon that subject  did he adopt
</p>
<p>the previous acts when he joined the Association? You will recollect
</p>
<p>this, that in almost all the charges of crime, for which the several traver-
</p>
<p>sers are here upon their trial, were for the most part committed before the
</p>
<p>2nd of October, 1843, when he joined ; and though the general way in
</p>
<p>whicn Judge Coleridge has laid down the proposition which I have read
</p>
<p>distinctly to you, would, as a matter of course, involve a party in the pre-
</p>
<p>vious guilt, though he did not join the Association until a late time, yet I
</p>
<p>think that in reference to Mr. Tierney I should put the question to you
</p>
<p> if you be satisfied that he did then join it, did he at that time adopt
</p>
<p>814
</p>
<p>llie Association as it stood, with all its acts and criminality (if such ex-
</p>
<p>isted), as they then did exist ? I perhaps anticipate, but I thought I
</p>
<p>might as well here make that observation with regard to Mr. Tierney,
</p>
<p>because I found, that in reading the judgment of Judge Coleridge in
</p>
<p>this case of the Queen v. Murphy, I was obliged to introduce and to
</p>
<p>state to you that passage which I have detailed, and it appeared to me
</p>
<p>to be the tit opportunity of stating what I might call a qualification.
</p>
<p>I do not mean to quarrel with what Mr. Justice Coleridge said, but in
</p>
<p>this case I prefer to leave it to you to consider and pronounce whether
</p>
<p>the qualification applies to Mr. Tierney, or not. I hope you have taken
</p>
<p>down the observations with regard to the law of conspiracy, which 1
</p>
<p>have endeavoured distinctly to detail to you. It is very fitting that the
</p>
<p>law should be distinctly understood, and not be the subject of any doubt
</p>
<p>or misapprehension.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, before I go into the observations upon this particular
</p>
<p>case, I should like to read to you certain observations, which I would
</p>
<p>adopt as my own, in a case to which the Court was referred by Mr.
</p>
<p>Sheil in his able statement in behalf of the traversers. He referred
</p>
<p>us to the case of Rex v. Kinvan, which was tried in the Court of
</p>
<p>Queen's Bench in Ireland, and the able speech (as he pronounced it to
</p>
<p>be) of the late Mr. Peter Burrowes, who was counsel for the traversers
</p>
<p> their leading counsel. Mr. O'Connell appears to have been counsel
</p>
<p>with him. Of Mr. Burrowes, I concur fully in the statement that has
</p>
<p>been made with regard to that very eminent man ; he was an able and a
</p>
<p>most constitutional lawyer, and I believe I may venture to say of him
</p>
<p>without going out of my way, that there was no man who ever appeared
</p>
<p>before a Court to whom popular rights were dearer, or who more effec-
</p>
<p>tively exerted himself on behalf of the people at large. 1 f he had a fail-
</p>
<p>ing, it certainly was not an aristocratical bias against the popular rights;
</p>
<p>therefore what fell from him upon the occasion when he made that
</p>
<p>speech, to which Mr. Sheil referred, is very worthy of consideration,
</p>
<p>and is not altogether inapplicable to the present case. In page 203
</p>
<p>of his address to the Jury, he says thus : " It is very evident that to as-
</p>
<p>sume such a right," that is, a right to represent the people, or any por-

</p>
<p>tion of them, " would be to encroach upon the exclusive privileges of
</p>
<p>" the House of Commons, and no man can doubt but that to assume the
</p>
<p>" character or exercise the functions of any department in the State, le-
</p>
<p>" gislative, executive, or judicial, is, and always was, a high misde-
</p>
<p>" meanor." I subscribe to that position. In page 205 of the same
</p>
<p>address he goes on thus : " Gentlemen of the Jury, we are surfeited with
</p>
<p>" visionary notions and republican declamations ; we have lost our re-
</p>
<p>" lish for the old, I hope not obsolete, principles of liberty, so cherished by
</p>
<p>" our ancestors. From the abuse of things of the highest worth, we
</p>
<p>" begin to forget their value. This, Gentlemen, is a most dangerous
</p>
<p>" state, and a most permanent evil ; every important invasion of a right
</p>
<p>" has been founded upon an abuse of that right, and has proceeded
</p>
<p>" through the apathy created by such abuse. Let us never fall into
</p>
<p>" this vulgar error. Let us give to the Government and the people
</p>
<p>815
</p>
<p>" their legitimate rights, and not suffer either to transgress. Feu'
</p>
<p>" are the rights reserved to the people, or which can be reserved under
</p>
<p>" a staple Constitution ; the Legislature must be sovereign. To ascribe
</p>
<p>" to it actual omnipotence is nonsense and impiety ; but to ascribe to it
</p>
<p>" relative omnipotence, is rational. No power can question or resist
</p>
<p>" its acts while it exists. But consistent with this acknowledged su-
</p>
<p>" premacy are the reserved popular right of a free press and an un-
</p>
<p>" shackled right of petitioning. They are the great pedestals of our
</p>
<p>" free and balanced Constitution. Impair either, and it totters ; with-
</p>
<p>" draw either, and it falls, and crushes the people and their liberties.
</p>
<p>" Do I say that these privileges are incapable of abuse, and should
</p>
<p>" not be contracted in their exercise by law ? No ; but I say that
</p>
<p>" each should be exercised without previous restraint. Let every man
</p>
<p>" publish at his peril, let no man dare exercise any previous control
</p>
<p>"over him; but if he publishes a public or private libel, let the law
</p>
<p>" punish him. In the same way, suffer nothing to impede the presenting
</p>
<p>" a petition ; but if, under the pretext of petitioning, men should assem-
</p>
<p>" ble and violate the law, vindicate the violated law." Those, Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, are the sound and constitutional principles that were thus announced
</p>
<p>by that eminent man and constitutional lawyer. He is no more now..
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, he has left these sentiments behind him; and
</p>
<p>Mr. Sheil (I thank him for it) has referred me to this speech in his very
</p>
<p>able address, no doubt as having his assent to the law as there enuncia-
</p>
<p>ted by that distinguished man.
</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen, what is the law, the violation of which we are
</p>
<p>called upon to bring into judgment  I anticipate nothing against any
</p>
<p>body here yet. The law as it exists, the law as it has existed for the
</p>
<p>last forty-three years, the law, as Her gracious Majesty has by her Co-
</p>
<p>ronation Oath bound herself and sworn to maintain it? Gentlemen, I
</p>
<p>will read you the Coronation Oath, or at least the commencement of it,
</p>
<p>as given in Judge Blackstone's Commentaries, page 235 : " The
</p>
<p>" Archbishop or Bishop shall say: ' Will you solemnly promise and swear
</p>
<p>" 'to govern the people of this kingdom of England, and the dominions
</p>
<p>" 'thereto belonging, according to the statutes in Parliament agreed on,

</p>
<p>" * and the laws and customs of the same ?' The King or Queen shall
</p>
<p>" ' say, ' I solemnly promise so to do.' " That is the Coronation Oath.
</p>
<p>Now what, with regard to this country and its connections with Great
</p>
<p>Britain, are the Statutes which she has sworn by her Coronation Oath
</p>
<p>to abide by, administer, and preserve ? We have heard, Gentlemen, a
</p>
<p>great deal of assertion ; we have heard a vast quantity of declamation ;
</p>
<p>we have heard much of complaints, of grievances ; we have heard a
</p>
<p>great deal of what the law ought to be ; we have heard you called upon
</p>
<p>to decide whether such a law ought to continue, as if you had any power
</p>
<p>of making a decision upon the subject at all ; the law of this realm, as
</p>
<p>it stands by the Act of Union, until that Act be repealed, is the only law
</p>
<p>that you can take into your consideration upon this subject. That is
</p>
<p>the law which the Queen, by her Coronation Oath, has sworn to pre-
</p>
<p>serve ; and it is idle to say, that in violation of that law, the Queen, as
</p>
<p>816
</p>
<p>she thinks proper, may depart from that law altogether, call a Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment of her own in Ireland, of her own motion, in concert with the
</p>
<p>people, and set up a new law and a new Constitution for this country,
</p>
<p>in direct violation of the Act of Union, which 1 am now going to state
</p>
<p>to you.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, in the Fortieth year of George the Third, an x\ct passed
</p>
<p>for the Union of Great Britain and Ireland. It recites : " Whereas in
</p>
<p>" pursuance of His Majesty's most gracious recommendation to the two
</p>
<p>" Houses of Parliament in Great Britain and Ireland respectively, to
</p>
<p>" consider of such measures as might best tend to strengthen and conso-
</p>
<p>" 1 i d ate the connexion between the two kingdoms, the two Houses of
</p>
<p>" Parliament of Great Britain, and the two Houses of Parliament of
</p>
<p>" Ireland, have severally agreed and resolved,  That in order to promote
</p>
<p>" and secure the essential interests of Great Britain and Ireland, find to
</p>
<p>" consolidate the strength, power, and resources of the British empire,
</p>
<p>" it will be advisable to concur in such measures as may best tend to
</p>
<p>" unite the two kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland into one kingdom,
</p>
<p>" in such manner and on such terms and conditions as may be established
</p>
<p>" by the Acts of the respective Parliaments of Great Britain and Ire-
</p>
<p>" land." There is the recital of a national compact for the future
</p>
<p>union of the two countries of Great Britain and Ireland sanctioned by
</p>
<p>their respective Legislatures, in the same solemn way in which the Act
</p>
<p>of Union between Great Britain and Scotland had been transacted and
</p>
<p>accomplished one hundred years before: " And whereas in furtherance
</p>
<p>" of the said resolution, both Houses of the said Two Parliaments re-
</p>
<p>" spectively have likewise agreed upon certain Articles for effectuating
</p>
<p>" and establishing the said purposes in the tenor following : Ar-
</p>
<p>" tide First, ' That it be the first Article of the Union of the kingdoms
</p>
<p>" ' of Great Britain and Ireland, that the said kingdom of Great Britain
</p>
<p>" ' and Ireland shall, upon the first day of January, which shall be in the
</p>
<p>" ' year of our Lord 1801 , and for ever after, be united into one kingdom
</p>
<p>" ' by the name of "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland;"
</p>
<p>" ' and that the royal style and titles appertaining to the Imperial
</p>
<p>" ' Crown of the said United Kingdom and its dependencies, and also

</p>
<p>" 'the ensigns, armorial flags, and banners thereof, shall be such as His
</p>
<p>" ' Majesty, by His royal proclamation, under the great seal of the
</p>
<p>" ' United Kingdom, shall be pleased to appoint." ' By that Article,
</p>
<p>from the passing of the Act of Union, the kingdom of Great Britain
</p>
<p>ceased to exist, the kingdom of Ireland ceased to exist; and instead of
</p>
<p>those two, there was formed one United Kingdom under the style and
</p>
<p>title of "the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland." Not one
</p>
<p>king thenceforth having two kingdoms under his dominion, but from
</p>
<p>thenceforth one king, having one kingdom designated as in the Article ;
</p>
<p>and the idea that the Queen oi Ireland may be treated or dealt with
</p>
<p>as the queen of a separate kingdom, is absurd, is seditious. Until
</p>
<p>the law be altered by the proper authority  (which I do not say but it
</p>
<p>may)  hut while the law remains as it is up to this time, as it has been
</p>
<p>during the whole of the year 1843, and the preceding years that have
</p>
<p>817
</p>
<p>intervened since the passing of the Act of Union, there is one Sovereign
</p>
<p>over one kingdom, incapable by himself of treating with any class of
</p>
<p>his subjects except the Legislature, with regard to a new Constitution,
</p>
<p>or new laws with respect to any part of the United Kingdom. And!
</p>
<p>say, moreover, whatever subject would take upon himself to inculcate
</p>
<p> to proclaim amongst the subjects of this part of the United Kingom,
</p>
<p>that he or any body else, abstracted from the Legislature, had a power,
</p>
<p>either separately by himself, or jointly with any portion of the inhabitants
</p>
<p>of this part of the United Kingdom, of treating with the Queen for the
</p>
<p>abrogation of the existing law, and to put in its place a new law, such
</p>
<p>as we have heard suggested, is guilty of an offence, is guilty of the crime
</p>
<p>of sedition ; and that if Her Majesty was pleased to condescend to treat
</p>
<p>and negotiate with him separately from her Parliament, and to adopt
</p>
<p>his suggestions, she has not the power of doing it without violating her
</p>
<p>Coronation Oath. Now, Gentlemen, see what the other iVrticles of the
</p>
<p>Act of Union are : " That it be the second Article of Union that the
</p>
<p>" succession to the Imperial Crown of the said United Kingdom, and
</p>
<p>" of the dominions thereunto belonging, shall continue limited and set-
</p>
<p>" tied in the same manner as the succession to the Imperial Crown of
</p>
<p>" the said kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland now stands limited and
</p>
<p>" settled according to the existing laws, and to the terms of Union be-
</p>
<p>" tween England and Scotland." Scotland, as well as England, was
</p>
<p>a party to the Act of Union with Ireland. Article the third is : " That
</p>
<p>" it be the third Article of Union that the said United Kingdom be re-
</p>
<p>" presented in one and the same Parliament, to be styled ' the Parlia-
</p>
<p>" ment of Great Britain and Ireland.' " Gentlemen, the Judges of
</p>
<p>our Courts are bound to administer the law, as they find the law con-
</p>
<p>structed by its proper authorities. We have sworn to preserve these laws,
</p>
<p>to administer justice according to those laws; and we have no power,
</p>
<p>if we had the disposition, to take upon ourselves  nor have you, Gentle-
</p>
<p>men ofthe Jury, to take upon yourselves  the power of altering those
</p>
<p>laws, which have been passed as such, by the King, Lords, and Com-
</p>
<p>mons of the country as by law established. It would be introduc-
</p>
<p>tory of the wildest anarchy and confusion, if any man, or set of men,

</p>
<p>abstracted from the Parliament, were permitted to say : " we do not like
</p>
<p>this law as it has been passed by the Legislature ; we think it was
</p>
<p>not properly passed ; we think there were reasons which ought to
</p>
<p>have prevailed against it, and therefore we are not bound in conscience
</p>
<p>longer to obey it." Any man who inculcates publicly that doctrine
</p>
<p>is guilty of sedition. It is not, Gentlemen, for us, or for you, or for any
</p>
<p>set of men, or any set of individuals abstracted from Parliament, to take
</p>
<p>that power and responsibility upon themselves. The law permits it to
</p>
<p>nobody excepting the Legislature of the country, which consists of the
</p>
<p>Queen, Lords, and Commons, as settled by the terms ofthe Act of Union.
</p>
<p>Then, Gentlemen, the Fourth Article of the Act goes on to regulate
</p>
<p>the number of Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and representatives in
</p>
<p>the House of Commons, who shall thenceforward be returned and sit
</p>
<p>in those respective Houses, so many for Ireland, so many for England,
</p>
<p>5M
</p>
<p>818
</p>
<p>and so many for Scotland. It is an essential article of agreement
</p>
<p>upon the basis of which these three great countries, England, Scotland,
</p>
<p>and Ireland, agreed together to dissolve themselves and to become
</p>
<p>united into one great empire, under the denomination of the United
</p>
<p>Kingdom of Great Britian and Ireland. I need not go through the
</p>
<p>other articles which regulate other matters which are thenceforward
</p>
<p>to subsist between the contracting Parliaments. All those being duly
</p>
<p>enumerated, the eighth Article goes on thus : " And whereas the said
</p>
<p>" Articles having by address of the respective Houses of Parliament
</p>
<p>" in Great Britain and Ireland been humbly laid before His Majesty, His
</p>
<p>" Majesty hasbeengraciously pleased to approve the same, and to recom-
</p>
<p>" mend to his two Houses of Parliament in Great Britain and Ireland
</p>
<p>" to consider such measures as may be necessary for giving effect to the
</p>
<p>" said Articles. In order, therefore, to give full effect and validity to the
</p>
<p>" same, be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with
</p>
<p>" the advice and consent ofthe Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Com-
</p>
<p>" mons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the
</p>
<p>" same, That the said foregoing recited Articles, each and every one of
</p>
<p>" them, according to the true import and tenor thereof, be ratified, con-
</p>
<p>" firmed, and approved, and be, and they are hereby declared to be the
</p>
<p>" Articles of the Union of Great Britain" [which includes Scotland]
</p>
<p>" and Ireland ; and the same shall be in force, and have effect for ever
</p>
<p>" from the first day of January, which shall be in the year of our Lord
</p>
<p>" ISO! , provided that before that period an Act shall have been passed by
</p>
<p>" the Parliament of Great Britain for carrying into effect in the like
</p>
<p>" manner the said foregoing recited Articles." Which Act was forthwith
</p>
<p>carried into effect. There, then, Gentlemen, is the law ratified by King,
</p>
<p>Lords, and Commons of both countries, and that is to be for ever the law
</p>
<p>of this land, which Her Majesty the Queen has by her Coronation Oath
</p>
<p>sworn to preserve ; and let no man presume to attempt to effect an altera-
</p>
<p>tion in this law by illegitimate or violent means, by threats of violence or
</p>
<p>other such shifts. But, let me not be misunderstood. There is a way in
</p>
<p>which grievances, if they exist, are to be redressed and set to rights. Re-
</p>
<p>collect the doctrine of that constitutional lawyer Mr. Burrowes, that " the

</p>
<p>" omnipotence ofthe Legislature must be acknowledged in any well-re-
</p>
<p>" gulated state."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, Mr. Sheil required me, when I should charge you in this
</p>
<p>case, to advert to the doctrine of Baron Alderson in his charge to the
</p>
<p>Grand Jury, in the case ofthe Queen v. Vincent, in 9th Carrington &
</p>
<p>Payne's Reports, page 93. Now this, Gentlemen, is what he requires
</p>
<p>me to refer to. I acquiesce both in his request and in the law on the sub-
</p>
<p>ject, as laid down by the eminent Judge by whom this charge to the Grand
</p>
<p>Jury was delivered. " There is one case in the calendar to which it is
</p>
<p>" desirable that I should address you. In that case four persons are
</p>
<p>"charged with having, 'on the 19th of April, at Newport, unlawfully
</p>
<p>" ' met, with divers other persons calling themselves Chartists, unlawfully
</p>
<p>" ' intending to disturb the peace of this realm, and to excite discontent,
</p>
<p>819
</p>
<p>" ' disaffection, and hatred to the Government and Constitution of the coun-
</p>
<p>" ' try.' " That is very like the object alleged to be the illegal object ol
</p>
<p>the traversers in the charge of conspiracy upon which they are now stand-
</p>
<p>ing their trial. " This charge," says Baron Alderson, " is a misdemea-
</p>
<p>" nor of a serious nature, if satisfactorily proved ; and it will be for you
</p>
<p>" to say upon the evidence, whether these persons have outstepped the
</p>
<p>" line of their duty, and instead of confining themselves to the temperate
</p>
<p>" and proper representation of such grievances, which they either endure,
</p>
<p>" or think they endure, have constituted themselves into that which, in
</p>
<p>" point of law, is an unlawful assembly of the people. To ascertain what
</p>
<p>" is an unlawful assembly, it is well that we should see what our best law-
</p>
<p>" yers have laid down with respect to unlawful assemblies. Mr. Sergeant
</p>
<p>" Hawkins, one of the best authorities on this subject, says that 'any
</p>
<p>" ' meeting whatsoever of great numbers of people, with such circum-
</p>
<p>" 'stances of terror as cannot but endanger the public peace, and raise
</p>
<p>" ' fears and jealousies among the King's subjects, seems properly to
</p>
<p>" ' be called an unlawful assembly ; as where great numbers com-
</p>
<p>" 'plaining of a common grievance meet together, armed in a warlike
</p>
<p>" ' manner, in order to consult together concerning the most proper
</p>
<p>" ' means for the recovery of their interests, for no one can foresee what.
</p>
<p>" 'may be the event of such an assembly.' So in Mr. Hunt's case,
</p>
<p>" which was tried at York, and afterwards came before the Court of
</p>
<p>" Queen's Bench, Mr. Justice Bayley (than whom no man was more
</p>
<p>" learned in the laws, or more enlightened in his views) says : ' if the
</p>
<p>" persons who assemble together say  we will have what we want
</p>
<p>" whether it be according to law or not, a meeting for such a purpose,
</p>
<p>" ' however it may be masked, if it be really for a purpose of that kind,
</p>
<p>"' is illegal. If a meeting from its general appearance, and from all
</p>
<p>" 'the accompanying circumstances, is calculated to excite terror, alarm,
</p>
<p>" ' and consternation, it is generally criminal and unlawful.' These are,
</p>
<p>" ' as I take it, the clear principles of law." Then he goes on to define
</p>
<p>the difference between an unlawful assembly and a riot, with which I
</p>
<p>need not trouble you. " You will investigate the circumstances under
</p>
<p>" which the assembly took place  whether the individuals who presided

</p>
<p>" and were present, were so by previous concert, or accidentally having
</p>
<p>"met; and if they met by previous concert, you will inquire whether
</p>
<p>" they have met at unseasonable hours of the night  if they have met
</p>
<p>" under circumstances of violence and danger  if they have been armed
</p>
<p>" with offensive weapons or used violent language  if they have propo-
</p>
<p>" sed to set the different classes of society at variance, the one with
</p>
<p>'' the other, and to put to death any part of Her Majesty's sub-
</p>
<p>jects; if any, all, or most of these things should appear before you,
</p>
<p>" there will, I think be little difficulty in saying that an assembly of
</p>
<p>" such persons under such circumstances, for such purposes, and using
</p>
<p>" such language, is a dangerous one. which cannot be tolerated in a
</p>
<p>" country governed by laws ; and it is but doing unto others as you
</p>
<p>" would they should do unto you, to repress meetings of that description ;
</p>
<p>" because what right have any persons to do (hat which produces terror,
</p>
<p>820
</p>
<p>" inconvenience and dismay among' their fellow-subjects?" Would
</p>
<p>there be any difference if these fellow-subjects happened to be the Le-
</p>
<p>gislature of the country ?  " which produces terror and dismay among
</p>
<p>their fellow-subjects." This was the case which Mr. Sheil required
</p>
<p>me to read, and I could not read one part without reading the whole.
</p>
<p>" Let me not, however, be misunderstood. There is no doubt that the
</p>
<p>" people of this country have a perfect right to meet for the purpose of
</p>
<p>" stating what are, or even what they consider to be, their grievances.
</p>
<p>" That right they always have have had, and I trust always will have."
</p>
<p>And so do I. " But in order to transmit that right unimpaired to pos-
</p>
<p>" terity"  You recollect the way in which Mr. Burrowes stated many
</p>
<p>of our valuable rights and privileges were lost by the abuse of them 
</p>
<p>" But in order to transmit that right unimpared to posterity, it is neces-
</p>
<p>H sary that it should be regulated by law and restrained by reason.
</p>
<p>" Therefore let them meet, if they will, in open day, peaceably and
</p>
<p>" quietly, and they will do wisely when they do so under the sanction of
</p>
<p>" those who are the constituted authorities of the country." Who does
</p>
<p>that represent ? " To meet under irresponsible presidency is a dange-
</p>
<p>" rous thing ; nevertheless if, when they do meet under that irresponsi-
</p>
<p>" ble presidency, they conduct themselves with peace, tranquillity, and
</p>
<p>" order, they will perhaps lose their time, but nothing else. They
</p>
<p>" will not put other people into alarm, terror, and consternation."
</p>
<p>Though it happens to be the King's Government. " They will probably in
</p>
<p>" the end come to the conclusion that they have acted foolishly ; but the
</p>
<p>" constitution of this country does not (God be thanked) punish persons, who
</p>
<p>" meaning to do that which is right in a peaceable and orderly manner,
</p>
<p>11 are only in error in the views which they have taken on some subject
</p>
<p>" of political interest." Now there is not one word of that charge in
</p>
<p>which I do not fully concur, and to which I am not fully satisfied
</p>
<p>to subscribe upon every occasion. Now, Gentlemen, mind what the
</p>
<p>same Judge in a few pages afterwards in the same case says, when he
</p>
<p>conies to charge the jurj* who were trying Vincent on the bill of indict-
</p>
<p>ment that was found by the Grand Jury on that charge which hebad pre-
</p>
<p>viously delivered, and which 1 have read to you. And first as to charg-

</p>
<p>ing the traversers with an unlawful conspiracy : " The indictment also
</p>
<p>" contains charges of conspiracy, which is a crime"  now this is one of
</p>
<p>the latest cases we have  "which is a crime which consists either in a
</p>
<p>" combination or agreement by persons to do some illegal act, or a com-
</p>
<p>" bination and agreement to effect a legal purpose by illegal mean3.
</p>
<p>" The purpose that the defendants had in view, as stated by the proseeu-
</p>
<p>" tors, was to excite disaffection and discontent, but the defendants say
</p>
<p>" that their purpose was by reasonable arguments and proper petitions to
</p>
<p>" obtain the five points mentioned by their learned counsel. If that
</p>
<p>" were so,. I think it is by no means illegal to petition on those points."
</p>
<p>To petition. " The duration of parliaments and the extent of the elec-
</p>
<p>" tive franchise have undergone more than one change by the authority
</p>
<p>" of Parliament itself." That is the legal tribunal. " With respect to
</p>
<p>" the voting by ballot, persons whose opinions are entitled to the highest
</p>
<p>821
</p>
<p>" respect are found to differ. There can be no illegality in petitioning
</p>
<p>" that members of Parliament should be paid for their services bv their
</p>
<p>" constituents ; indeed they were so paid in ancient times, and they were
</p>
<p>" not required to have a property qualification till the reign of Queen
</p>
<p>" Anne, and are not required to have it in order to represent any part of
</p>
<p>" Scotland or the English Universities." Attend to what follows; this
</p>
<p>Judge has been laying down this constitutional law, for which he is so de-
</p>
<p>servedly held in high estimation by Mr. Sheil and every other lawyer.
</p>
<p>" If however the defendants say that they will effect these changes by
</p>
<p>" physical force, that is an offence against the law of the country. No
</p>
<p>" civilized society can exist if changes are to be effected in the law by phy-
</p>
<p>" sical force. And if eminent persons have done as the learned counsel
</p>
<p>" has stated, and their conduct were to come before us in a Court of Jus-
</p>
<p>u tice, we should (however painful it would be to be placed in such a situa-
</p>
<p>" tion) act towards them also exactly as we ought now to act toward the
</p>
<p>" present defendants."
</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen of the Jury, there is the constitutional law laid
</p>
<p>down by this very eminent constitutional lawyer, Baron Alderson. No
</p>
<p>man is more highly respected in the Profession, and no man is more emi-
</p>
<p>nent upon the English bench of justice.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside.  I believe they were acquitted of the conspiracy,
</p>
<p>my Lord.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  But they were found guilty of attend-
</p>
<p>ing an unlawful assembly. That is not part of what Baron Alderson said.
</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen, what I have said is, that I fully concur with Ba-
</p>
<p>ron Alderson in both charges, both in his charge to the Grand Jury, and
</p>
<p>in his charge to the Petty Jury ; and in that I have the full and entire
</p>
<p>approbation and concurrence of my learned brethren of the Bench. Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen of the Jury, let us not be misunderstood, as Baron Alderson said,
</p>
<p>let me not be misunderstood. If a man has a grievance  if any set of men
</p>
<p>have a grievance, or if they think, or fancy they have a grievance, it is
</p>
<p>no crime for a man to have the grievance, or to think he has it; it is no
</p>
<p>crime to make a mistake with regard to his political position in respect
</p>
<p>of that alleged grievance. He has a right also to communicate freely
</p>

</p>
<p>his sentiments upon that subject to his fellows, similarly circumstanced
</p>
<p>or otherwise. He has a right to make that communication not merely
</p>
<p>to his friends or fellow-subjects, but to strangers; he has a right to
</p>
<p>make those communications and those complaints wherever he goes, if
</p>
<p>he thinks fit. Even if he should attend a public meeting; however large
</p>
<p>that meeting may be, it may happen indeed to be dangerous in regard
</p>
<p>to the consequences that may follow from it, but the mere fact of its
</p>
<p>being a public meeting is no reason why a man who has a grievance,
</p>
<p>or thinks he has, should not attend that meeting, to make a statement
</p>
<p>of what he conceives he has to complain of, and so upon the principle
</p>
<p>of free discussion endeavour to get, by peaceable means, as many
</p>
<p>allies and advocates in support of his alleged grievance as he can pro-
</p>
<p>cure. That, Gentlemen, is no crime, that is the law, and the liberality
</p>
<p>of the law, as stated by Baron Alderson, " God forbid we should ever
</p>
<p>822
</p>
<p>be without it ;" and so I say too. But, Gentlemen, in order to disse-
</p>
<p>minate the knowledge of those grievances, he must take care not to in-
</p>
<p>fringe upon the rights and privileges of others ; and he is the more bound
</p>
<p>to be careful as to the effect of what he does, if the assemblies which he
</p>
<p>attends are congregated in such masses and multitudes as to excite terror
</p>
<p>and alarm, either amongst the neighbouring people, or amongst those
</p>
<p>who are bound to watch over and preserve the peace and Constitution of
</p>
<p>the country. Tf he goes with arms it is the more likely that the law will
</p>
<p>be infringed, but if he goes without arms (which has been the case
</p>
<p>always here), it does not follow, therefore, that that meeting will be
</p>
<p>lawful. I do not mean to say that the mere attending the meeting,
</p>
<p>however large the numbers may be, if no breach of the peace be com-
</p>
<p>mitted, nor tendency to a breach of the peace, at the time, or immediately
</p>
<p>ensuing the meeting  I do not mean to say that his attending such a
</p>
<p>meeting under such circumstances will be necessarily unlawful. I do
</p>
<p>not mean to say that it would be necessarily lawful. I shall explain
</p>
<p>that by-and-by ; but there is nothing in the mere fact of the assemblage
</p>
<p>of the people that renders that an illegal act. But in order to make the
</p>
<p>meeting unlawful it would not be necessary, though in fact the peace
</p>
<p>was not broken, that therefore the parties should not be guilty of the of-
</p>
<p>fence of exciting and creating terror and alarm amongst Her Majesty's
</p>
<p>subjects. The meeting may, though the parties went to it unarmed,
</p>
<p>have been attended with demonstrations of physical force, that would
</p>
<p>reasonably have excited fear, terror, or alarm amongst the peaceable
</p>
<p>subjects of Her Majesty in the neighbourhood, whether there was cause
</p>
<p>for it or not, beyond the enormous mass and multitude of persons as-
</p>
<p>sembled ; and if persons were alarmed and terrified by that mass and
</p>
<p>multitude so assembling, why, then, the terror so caused would have
</p>
<p>shown that to be an illegal assembly, for which the parties so as-
</p>
<p>sembling would be answerable. But it is not necessary that that
</p>
<p>should have been the state of things, in order to make that an un-
</p>
<p>lawful assembly. Suppose the parties all went to that great meet-
</p>
<p>ing in ever such great multitudes  suppose they went without
</p>
<p>arms ; suppose they conducted themselves with great propriety and

<p>regularity; suppose no breach of the peace was committed; sup-
</p>
<p>pose there was no tendency to a breach of the peace, all those facts
</p>
<p>might concur toward the establishment of the innocence of that
</p>
<p>meeting, and yet, Gentlemen of the Jury, that meeting might
</p>
<p>have been an illegal assembly, and every person attending it
</p>
<p>would be guilty of a misdemeanor. Suppose that the object of
</p>
<p>collecting those hundreds and thousands of persons was, not for
</p>
<p>the purpose of committing a breach of the peace; suppose they
</p>
<p>bad an ulterior and more remote object ; suppose it was not for the
</p>
<p>purpose of terrifying the neighbours by what was done, or intended
</p>
<p>to be done, by the persons assembling at that meeting ; but suppose
</p>
<p>that the parties who collected that mass and multitude together did
</p>
<p>so for the purpose of making a demonstration of immense force and
</p>
<p>physical power, guided and actuated by the will and command of
</p>
<p>the person who had caused that multitude to assemble, for no pur-
</p>
<p>823
</p>
<p>pose of a present breach of the peace, but for the purpose of making
</p>
<p>an exhibition to tbose with whom he had to do, to those who were
</p>
<p>the legal legislators of the country ; and that his object in calling
</p>
<p>all those people together  his object in assembling, dispersing,
</p>
<p>recalling them, was to do that with the greatest possible notoriety
</p>
<p> suppose he did it in the open day, where all the world could see
</p>
<p>and hear him, and that he had as his object to overawe the Legis-
</p>
<p>lature, who were likely to have to consider certain political subjects
</p>
<p>in which he had his own views and his own interests  for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of deterring the Legislature and the Government of the country
</p>
<p>from a free and cool deliberate judgment on the subject; if that
</p>
<p>were his object in causing and procuring that demonstration, then,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I say that that is an illegal object in him, and in all
</p>
<p>who concur and are agreed with him in procuring such means for
</p>
<p>such an end. I have not gone the length to say that I suppose that
</p>
<p>any of the traversers are guilty ; on the contrary, I am merely tell-
</p>
<p>ing to you, and explaining to you, as I go along, what I take to be
</p>
<p>the clear and incontestible law on this subject. I admit to the full
</p>
<p>extent the principle of full and free discussion, cool and deliberate
</p>
<p>consideration. I do even admit of warm arguments in support of
</p>
<p>political views. They may be not only admissible, but they may
</p>
<p>be quite necessary and right for the information of all those who
</p>
<p>may have to deal with the subject in question  to enable them to
</p>
<p>come to a right conclusion as to the course in which they should
</p>
<p>advise Her Majesty to act with regard to that particular ques-
</p>
<p>tion. But I should be glad to know, are the Parliament of the
</p>
<p>country, or the Queen's Ministers, or those who are intrusted, ne-
</p>
<p>cessarily intrusted, with the management of state affairs  are they
</p>
<p>to be the only persons in the country who are not to have the bene-
</p>
<p>fit of free discussion, and the benefit of fair, cool, impartial delibe-
</p>
<p>ration? Are they to lay aside fair discussion and deliberate judg-
</p>
<p>ment, and to be influenced and led astray by the intimidations of
</p>
<p>fear, or the demonstrations of physical power and force? If the
</p>
<p>members of the Legislature think proper in their judgments to come

</p>
<p>to adifferent opinion upon this or that political subject, are they the
</p>
<p>only persons who are not to have the advantage of free and full dis-
</p>
<p>cussion ? Are they to be told, here are hundreds of thousands of
</p>
<p>fighting men  they are all peaceable  there is no breach of the law
</p>
<p> they coalesce with no illegal bodies  they are warned and advised
</p>
<p>to keep out of secret societies  they have been guilty of no breach of
</p>
<p>the law  they have not appeared in arms, but they are, physically
</p>
<p>speaking, the finest peasantry in the world, they stand number one
</p>
<p>in the class of nations ; and jou may differ from me if you like, but
</p>
<p>take care ; the first step you take, those masses that are now dissolv-
</p>
<p>ing at my command " like snow under my feet," will reassemble at
</p>
<p>my call, and then what will be the step that you will take ? Take care
</p>
<p>of that. Now is that the way in which the transactions of the go-
</p>
<p>vernment of the country are to be influenced ? I have no hesita-
</p>
<p>tion in saying, Gentlemen, if you come to be of opinion that that
</p>
<p>was the object of the persons who collected those multitudinous
</p>
<p>824
</p>
<p>meetings one after another all over the country  if you be of opinion
</p>
<p>that their object was not what they professed, to consider of griev-
</p>
<p>ances, to talk of and discuss them, to lay a petition before that
</p>
<p>Parliament, the legality of whose existence they are denying  if
</p>
<p>you believe that that was not their object, but, on the contrary, that
</p>
<p>it was for the purpose of procuring changes by intimidation and
</p>
<p>overawing the counsels of the Legislature and the Government of
</p>
<p>the State, then I am of opinion, Gentlemen, that in that latter case,
</p>
<p>and with that latter object, their object was unlawful, and if more
</p>
<p>than one have concurred to procure it by unlawful means, they are
</p>
<p>guilty of the act of conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Before we go to the consideration of the particular case of each,
</p>
<p>I will make some further observations which seem to me to apply
</p>
<p>to the case of all. The traversers one and all say that they are Re-
</p>
<p>pealers, that is to say, that they are persons who conscientiously en-
</p>
<p>tertain the object of Repeal as best suited to the interest of the coun-
</p>
<p>try. They say, that by means of the Union they have suffered griev-
</p>
<p>ances. I will not now enter into the allegations which have been put
</p>
<p>forward, and with which this Court was occupied for several days,
</p>
<p>as to the manner in which the Act of Union was carried. It is forty-
</p>
<p>three years ago since the King, Lords, and Commons of the two
</p>
<p>countries passed that Act of Parliament ; and by their common
</p>
<p>concurrence the Act of Union has continued in force, and is in
</p>
<p>force, up to this hour. Very many Acts of Parliament have been
</p>
<p>passed within the last forty-three years by the United Parliament.
</p>
<p>In those Acts of Parliament, the members who were returned for
</p>
<p>Ireland, the members who were returned for Scotland, the members
</p>
<p>who were returned for England, all had their share. They all voted,
</p>
<p>or had an opportunity of voting, of speaking, of free discussion, to
</p>
<p>the utmost extent of the word. Very many most important Acts of
</p>
<p>Parliament have been passed, which ought to have been passed
</p>
<p>according to the deliberative judgment of the United Parliament  .
</p>
<p>not one part of the kingdom taking on itself to judge or act for the
</p>
<p>other, but the entire Parliament, with its concurrent Legislature,

</p>
<p>and under the sanction, and with the co-operation of the Monarch
</p>
<p>of the two countries, making their decision on those political sub-
</p>
<p>jects, which so received the concurrence of Parliament and the
</p>
<p>Royal Assent. I need not say amongst those  it has been referred
</p>
<p>to over and over again  was the Act of Catholic Emancipation.
</p>
<p>And no emancipated, as it is called, Roman Catholic of Ireland
</p>
<p>would be entitled to stand in the position in which he now stands,
</p>
<p>or exercise those rights which he deservedly enjoys, if it were not
</p>
<p>for that Act, passed by that Parliament, which is alleged to be, as
</p>
<p>they assert, totally incapable of passing any Act. The Reform
</p>
<p>Act in the same way ; and a variety of other Acts more or less con-
</p>
<p>versant with popular rights. And observe this, that in the Reform
</p>
<p>Acts for England and for Scotland, the Irish members sent from
</p>
<p>this country, under the Act of Union, gave their votes and ^their
</p>
<p>voices, and they concurred in, or might have altered, those Acts as
</p>
<p>they passed through the Legislature. If the proposition be true,
</p>
<p>825
</p>
<p>which T hnve so often heard contended for, that the Act of Union
</p>
<p>was a nullity, and if Mr. O'Connell was right in proclaiming it so to
</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands assembled at Mullaghmast and elsewhere,
</p>
<p>the result would be that Mr. O'Connell would have no right to sit
</p>
<p>in the Imperial Parliament, and no emancipated Roman Catholic
</p>
<p>would be entitled, as a free citizen, to the rights and privileges
</p>
<p>which he ought to enjoy as such.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, the traversers are all accused of for-
</p>
<p>warding, whether by means legal or illegal will be the question for
</p>
<p>you, the Repeal of that Act of Parliament, the Act of Union; and
</p>
<p>if the last proposition I have stated to you were correct, it would
</p>
<p>render it useless for these persons, or any of them, to take the pre-
</p>
<p>sent step. If the Act of Union be void, where is the necessity,
</p>
<p>or where the power, for repealing a nullity ? The two things
</p>
<p>are inconsistent ; for the Repeal of the Union, in the eyes of rea-
</p>
<p>son and common sense, pre-supposes the existence of the Act of
</p>
<p>Union. We have no right to discuss the merits of those questions.
</p>
<p>We must take, as I have already stated to you, the Act of Union
</p>
<p>as in full force ; and even if you had the power (which you clearly
</p>
<p>have not) to interfere with it directly or indirectly, it would be
</p>
<p>very difficult indeed for me to tell you whether you ought to exer-
</p>
<p>cise that power in justice, reason, and common sense.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, a great many years ago Mr. O'Connell appears to
</p>
<p>have entertained a strongly grounded opinion against, perhaps the
</p>
<p>validity, but certainly the propriety, of the Act of Union. In the
</p>
<p>year 1799, before the Act of Union passed, he has given in evi-
</p>
<p>dence, that he attended a meeting in Dublin, regularly constituted
</p>
<p>and regularly assembled, at which he made a speech, and declared
</p>
<p>those sentiments in public. That was given in free discussion, and
</p>
<p>nobody prevented his doing so ; every body perhaps did not agree
</p>
<p>with him, but that is another matter. He had the right; he ex-
</p>
<p>ercised the right of delivering his sentiments in public day, open
</p>
<p>to all the world. But what has that to say to the question, whether
</p>
<p>he was guilty or not of what took place in 1843, something more

</p>
<p>than forty-three years after he attended that meeting and made thai
</p>
<p>speech ? It is perfectly irrelevant. In 1810 he altended another
</p>
<p>meeting ; this was ten years after the Act of Union had been in
</p>
<p>force and operation. This last meeting was a meeting regularly
</p>
<p>convened ; not by irresponsible authority, not great masses of per-
</p>
<p>sons assembling under no control, but a meeting convened by the
</p>
<p>High Sheriff or Sheriffs of the city of Dublin, at which there was
</p>
<p>a full attendance of a great number of most respectable gentlemen,
</p>
<p>perhaps persons of high rank within the city of Dublin. Every
</p>
<p>freeman and freeholder was invited to attend  was invited to
</p>
<p>attend for the purpose of free discussion, and giving his deliberate
</p>
<p>opinion as to what should be done, either in concurring in a peti-
</p>
<p>tion for Repeal of the Union, or the contrary. Mr. O'Connell at-
</p>
<p>tended there ; Mr. O'Connell did what he had a perfect right to
</p>
<p>do  delivered his sentiments in public, without fear or without
</p>
<p>control; as far as he confined himself to free discussion, giving
</p>
<p>5N
</p>
<p>82G
</p>
<p>no undue offence to any body present, be had a right so to deliver
</p>
<p>himself, and so he did. Now what has that to say to the events of
</p>
<p>1843 ? I confess it is the first time I ever knew of a man or set
</p>
<p>of men, accused of a specific crime or crimes in the year 1843,
</p>
<p>seeking to justify himself from that charge, by proof of what he or
</p>
<p>they respectively did forty or thirty or twenty years before. Does this
</p>
<p>show anything like a continuity of purpose ? What a person ex-
</p>
<p>pressed in the way of political rights at one time, may be given in
</p>
<p>evidence to show his intentions as to certain expressions or acts
</p>
<p>done by him twelve years afterwards, as in the case of Home
</p>
<p>Tooke ; is it to be inferred from that, that, therefore, in what is
</p>
<p>not a similar case, or anything like a similar case, a similar course
</p>
<p>of proceeding may be pursued ? Now there is this wide difference
</p>
<p>between the two. Home Tooke was accused of very questionable
</p>
<p>matter, both as to what he wrote, and as to what he did, and he
</p>
<p>was permitted to give a construction to that questionable matter,
</p>
<p>on the principle of continuity of purpose, and to give a colour
</p>
<p>(perhaps the true colour) to the matter for which he was then tried,
</p>
<p>by the evidence of his previous opinions and acts, though they had
</p>
<p>taken place and been expressed several years before. The circum-
</p>
<p>stances were similar; the existence of them gave a character to the
</p>
<p>position in which Home Tooke stood ; they were properly ad-
</p>
<p>mitted in that case. Can that be said of the present case ? Public
</p>
<p>speeches made at a public meeting, convened by the Sheriffs of
</p>
<p>the city of Dublin in the one case, and the Lord Mayor in the
</p>
<p>other  public speeches made, resolutions passed, petitions for-
</p>
<p>warded to the Crown, and presented by the city representatives 
</p>
<p>what analogy has that to the position in which Mr. Daniel O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell is represented to have stood in 1843 ? Were these meetings con-
</p>
<p>vened by the magistrates ? Was there any one magistrate present 
</p>
<p>were they convened magisterially? Was any of them convened
</p>
<p>magisterially? Not one, that I am aware of. Were any of them
</p>
<p>convened by orders and directions of the National Repeal Associa-
</p>
<p>tion ? We have Mr. O'Connell's answer to that, stating the num-

<p>ber of Monster Meetings which he had caused to be convened for
</p>
<p>his own purposes. The cases, therefore, are, in their existing cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances, quite different. But supposing that were not so : after
</p>
<p>all, what is the meaning of those words " continuity of purpose V
</p>
<p>I have no objection to its going to the Jury on that ; it must go to
</p>
<p>the Jury, and you shall have the full benefit of it.
</p>
<p>Now in the year 1843 there had subsisted for a considerable
</p>
<p>lime, as much at least as three years before, an Association in the
</p>
<p>city of Dublin, which was called the National Repeal Association.
</p>
<p>Sir Colman O'Loghlen was desirous that I should take notice
</p>
<p>(and it is very right you should take notice, Gentlemen), that in a
</p>
<p>short time, I believe a few months after the formation of the Repeal
</p>
<p>Association, an improvement was made upon its name by the in-
</p>
<p>troduction of the word "Loyal," and thai from thenceforward it
</p>
<p>bore, and has borne, the name  The Loyal National Repeal Associa-
</p>
<p>tion ; whether that be or not of any importance is for you to judge.
</p>
<p>827
</p>
<p>I do not mean, Gentlemen of the Jury, in any respect to take tlie
</p>
<p>facts from you, and I wish to submit them all fairly to you, but at
</p>
<p>the same time to submit them all to you; that is to say, that no
</p>
<p>portion of the facts shall he kept from you. It is now "The Loyal
</p>
<p>National Repeal Association ;" sfet nominis umbra, whether you
</p>
<p>think there is anything in that or not, it is for you to say. At that
</p>
<p>Association Mr. O'Connell obtained and possessed unquestionably
</p>
<p>an authority, I would say  but I believe fie has said so himself 
</p>
<p>bordering- upon an absolute. Now during- the existence of that As-
</p>
<p>sociation, meetings were held in a particular part of Dublin, where
</p>
<p>speeches were made from time to time ; addresses to the people
</p>
<p>of Ireland were promulgated from the rooms of that Association,
</p>
<p>addressed to them by Mr. O'Connell ; you will say whether or
</p>
<p>not he does not take upon himself, in all those addresses, the
</p>
<p>position of leader of the people to whom those addresses were
</p>
<p>issued. These have been given in evidence on the part of the tra-
</p>
<p>versers, and they are properly submitted to you, and deeply dwelt
</p>
<p>upon by them, in order to show, that from the beginning to the
</p>
<p>end, there was an inculcation of loyalty to the Queen, and a deter-
</p>
<p>mination to support her prerogatives ; that there were, from time
</p>
<p>to time, warnings, and threatenings, and advice, and direction, nay,
</p>
<p>I believe even commands, to the members of that Association, and
</p>
<p>to the people of Ireland, to abstain from crime, to join no Chartists,
</p>
<p>no physical-force men, no secret societies ; that whoever committed
</p>
<p>a crime added power to the enemy ; and throughout all those ad-
</p>
<p>dresses and resolutions, which have been so given in evidence,
</p>
<p>from the year 1840, when that Association was instituted, until
</p>
<p>the beginning of the year 1843, there was a continuation and a
</p>
<p>repetition of the same inculcations, to the same effect, as I have
</p>
<p>stated generally to you. A great many of these have been given
</p>
<p>in evidence. I am not aware, that substantially I have omitted
</p>
<p>anything favourable to the traversers, as to the contents of those
</p>
<p>several addresses or resolutions; I believe I have stated all fairly
</p>
<p>and fully, and, therefore, I do not think it necessary to call your

</p>
<p>attention to any detail upon that subject ; the more particularly as
</p>
<p>it is admitted by the Solicitor-General, that for that period, from
</p>
<p>1840 to the beginning of the year 1843, he brings no accusation
</p>
<p>against Mr. O'Connell, or the members of that Association, or any
</p>
<p>of them. Me makes no charge; without knowing whether there
</p>
<p>be guilt, or whether there be not, his position is  I do not inquire
</p>
<p>into that; up to 1843 the charge of the Crown imputing crime
</p>
<p>does not commence.
</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen of the Jury, the crime imputed commences
</p>
<p>in 1843. Mr. O'Connell and the traversers say generally, that they
</p>
<p>had a legal purpose in their Association, to procure a Repeal of the
</p>
<p>Union in such ways, as they say the law and the Constitution allow.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor General says : up to 1843 I do not deny the propo-
</p>
<p>sition that you advance; the Act of Union is what you consider to
</p>
<p>be a grievance and a great grievance, and you have a right, by free-
</p>
<p>dom of discussion, by petitions to the Crown, by petitions to Par-
</p>
<p>828
</p>
<p>liamenf, by every other legal and constitutional way, to endeavour
</p>
<p>to relieve yourselves from those grievances, or supposed grievances,
</p>
<p>and thereby, and so to procure a Repeal of the Union. They at
</p>
<p>the other side say, they require no more; and what they profess
</p>
<p>and state, they were doing was, to follow those means which the
</p>
<p>law allowed, and thereby to procure their object, the Repeal of the
</p>
<p>Union. In 1S43, the beginning of that year, the Crown says a
</p>
<p>great change took place in the affairs of the Repeal Association,
</p>
<p>and Mr. O'Connell at their head; and from henceforth, whatever
</p>
<p>may have been their antecedent proceedings, of which he says
</p>
<p>nothing, from thenceforth, the means by which they attempted to
</p>
<p>effect the Repeal of the Union, if that were their object, became
</p>
<p>illegal. Now, Gentlemen, it lies upon the Crown to maintain that
</p>
<p>proposition; it lies upon the Crown to maintain it, and prove it by
</p>
<p>evidence to your satisfaction, that from some time in 1843, such
</p>
<p>a conspiracy as has been charged in the indictment existed ; the
</p>
<p>precise time, or day, or place, is not material. Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>said he was deprived of the means of proving an alibi  why, it is
</p>
<p>not necessary ; he has had notice of the facts imputed to him, he
</p>
<p>has had a bill of particulars, and he has had overt acts stated upon
</p>
<p>the face of the indictment; but without proving a direct time or
</p>
<p>place in which an illegal agreement was concocted between two or
</p>
<p>more of the traversers, it is for you to say, are you satisfied upon
</p>
<p>the facts laid before you, that though the actual time of the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy is not proved, yet that such a conspiracy as is imputed
</p>
<p>must have taken place, from the facts that are admitted, or proved,
</p>
<p>coming from one or more different parties charged with this con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, and in furtherance of the common design. The onus of
</p>
<p>that lies upon the Crown; and, Gentlemen, you must be satisfied,
</p>
<p>that the guilt, which is so imputed, has been proved ; that is, that
</p>
<p>satisfactory evidence is given to you, of the existence of the alleged
</p>
<p>conspiracy, the alleged compact, the alleged agreement and com-
</p>
<p>mon design between the several traversers, or some of them ; and if
</p>
<p>you are not satisfied by them, I am bound to say, Gentlemen, if that

</p>
<p>is not made out to your minds, so as to leave it above and beyond
</p>
<p>reasonable doubt upon the subject, it will be your duty not to con-
</p>
<p>vict upon presumption; you are to convict only upon satisfactory
</p>
<p>proof, either direct or inferential. The onus is on the Crown; and
</p>
<p>that is another reason why I pass over without more particular
</p>
<p>detail, the evidence given on behalf of the traversers. Gentlemen
</p>
<p>of the Jury, the nature of the proof given by the Crown is this; it
</p>
<p>will be for you to say, are you satisfied or are you not, with the
</p>
<p>way in which the Crown has proved its case.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, the Crown say, and I think there is
</p>
<p>evidence to support the statement (the weight is with you), that
</p>
<p>some time in the beginning of 1843, a material alteration took
</p>
<p>place in the system and regulations of the Association, the Repeal
</p>
<p>Association. It had before that lime become a very great body 
</p>
<p>T mean in point of numbers; I believe al*o, very considerable sums
</p>
<p>of money had been sent in the way of contributions, both from
</p>
<p>829
</p>
<p>various parts of this country, from Great Britain, from America,
</p>
<p>perhaps something from France, but I am not sure of that, and 1
</p>
<p>will leave it out. It had had communications extending and ra-
</p>
<p>mifying in various directions. But in 1843, proceedings were
</p>
<p>adopted, for the purpose of rendering those communications, and
</p>
<p>thai system, more extensive and more efficacious. A plan was
</p>
<p>adopted for a new method of the admission of persons desirous to
</p>
<p>become members of that Association. Classes were created, into
</p>
<p>which members were to be distributed, and under the name of
</p>
<p>which they were to be known. Those classes were three; the ge-
</p>
<p>neral class, who are called Associates; every person who subscribed
</p>
<p>a certain small sum of money, amounting to only one shilling a
</p>
<p>year, was capable of becoming an Associate, upon obtaining a card
</p>
<p>of the Society. Every person who paid one pound a year, was to
</p>
<p>be entitled to admission as a member, and enrolled, obtaining a
</p>
<p>different kind of card ; the second class were called Members. The
</p>
<p>third class were called Volunteers, and they who subscribed ten
</p>
<p>pounds, or procured subscriptions to that amount from others,
</p>
<p>were entitled to be admitted as Volunteers; and one and all of
</p>
<p>those persons were to be, by a certain form, admitted into the So-
</p>
<p>ciety, and enrolled in its books. Now here was certainly a very
</p>
<p>strange, I was going to say formidable, mode of organization,
</p>
<p>which was adopted by the Society in the year 1843. 1 think Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell has said at more than one meeting, that in one way or
</p>
<p>other, he had three-fourths of the male population of the country
</p>
<p>enrolled as members of that Society ; ami a little computation,
</p>
<p>taking it at the lowest sum of a shilling a year, would show you
</p>
<p>what large funds the Society must thereby have collected. I do
</p>
<p>not absolutely say, that that is illegal ; but when a Society is in-
</p>
<p>tended to extend all over the country, and does ramify itself in
</p>
<p>that way, collecting from each person a sum of money, of the ap-
</p>
<p>plication of which they know nothing, but collecting from each,
</p>
<p>a sum of money to be laid out for the objects and purposes of the
</p>
<p>Society, whatever they may be, such a system appears to me, to

</p>
<p>involve a dangerous state of things.
</p>
<p>About the same time effective resolutions were proposed and
</p>
<p>adopted, with regard to the appointment of the officers of this So-
</p>
<p>ciety. I am speaking now having regard to what cannot be passed
</p>
<p>over in this case, the question of organization. There were ap-
</p>
<p>pointed what they called Repeal Inspectors ; what they were, Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen of the Jury, we have no particular knowledge of, nor am I
</p>
<p>aware of anything that gives us an insight into the nature or the
</p>
<p>duties of that particular class of officers, called Repeal Inspectors,
</p>
<p>but there is evidence that such officers did exist, and they were spread
</p>
<p>over the country. But the main-spring by which the machinery
</p>
<p>was conducted, the grand plan that was had recourse to, in order
</p>
<p>to consolidate and direct the energies of the Association, consisted
</p>
<p>in the appointment of what are called Repeal Wardens. Now,
</p>
<p>Gentleman of the Jury, the Repeal Wardens, at least in their pre-
</p>
<p>sent system, were appointed in the year 1843, something about the
</p>
<p>830
</p>
<p>time when the arrangement was adopted for the admission by cards
</p>
<p>of the several members of the Society. You will see, Gentlemen
</p>
<p>of the Jury, whether or not there was discipline in the way in which
</p>
<p>that was conducted. The Repeal Wardens got their instructions ;
</p>
<p>the duties prescribed to them were all acts of the Association 
</p>
<p>committees appointed to report upon them, reports adopted and
</p>
<p>acted on by the creation of a system of Repeal Wardens extend-
</p>
<p>ing all over Ireland, having their duties confined to particular dis-
</p>
<p>tricts, communicating with the interior, receiving their instructions
</p>
<p>from the Association itself, and making regular reports or commu-
</p>
<p>nications of every thing that occurred to the Association. That,
</p>
<p>with the assistance of Repeal Inspectors, I would have said,
</p>
<p>amounted to something like a very well regulated police. I do not
</p>
<p>call them police; I call them only as the Association called them,
</p>
<p>Repeal Wardens, the persons who are described by Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>in his speech at the Kilkenny meeting, last August, if I do not
</p>
<p>mistake, persons very competent to be at the head of the people,
</p>
<p>in the same way that officers or sergeants in the army might be.
</p>
<p>Now there was not a part of Ireland, in which that system was
</p>
<p>not introduced. The intention was, that it should extend over the
</p>
<p>entire. The duty of the Repeal Wardens so appointed was this,
</p>
<p>amongst others  to take care that there should not be within their
</p>
<p>respective districts, a single adult male, a single person I mean,
</p>
<p>who should not become a member of the Association, by being
</p>
<p>invited to join and pay his subscription, which, although indivi-
</p>
<p>dually small, altogether amounted to a great sum. There was another
</p>
<p>duty imposed upon them. I have here before me the Instruc-
</p>
<p>tions for the Appointment of Repeal Wardens; I am stating sub-
</p>
<p>stantially the document to you, and I am speaking under the cor-
</p>
<p>rection perfectly of the Gentlemen of the other side to see, whether
</p>
<p>I do not state correctly, the several documents as I go along; and
</p>
<p>I shall be very much obliged to them, if they find in any particu-
</p>
<p>lar I fall short, or mistake, or misstate the documents that occur, to
</p>
<p>interrupt me. It is quite right that they should be aware of that ;

</p>
<p>I shall state no document they have not, and for the end of justice
</p>
<p>it is essential, that if I misstate at all, I should be corrected. They
</p>
<p>had, Gentlemen, besides collecting and taking care that every per-
</p>
<p>son became a member of the Society, a duty imposed upon them,
</p>
<p>that all the people in their respective districts should be furnished
</p>
<p>with newspapers. Now, Gentlemen, there were in connexion with
</p>
<p>the Association, three gentlemen, who are all of them at present
</p>
<p>amongst the traversers at the bar, who were respectively proprie-
</p>
<p>tors of, or engaged in certain newspapers in the city of Dublin ;
</p>
<p>I need not say one way or other as to the tendency of their con-
</p>
<p>tents. The Repeal Wardens were to take care, that within their
</p>
<p>respective districts, a certain number of Associates, that is, of the
</p>
<p>members of the Association, should be provided, not with news-
</p>
<p>papers generally, of whatever class they might think necessary to
</p>
<p>inform themselves in point of politics, not the Evening Mail, or a
</p>
<p>paper of that kind, but they were to lake care, that they were fur-
</p>
<p>831
</p>
<p>nishetl with papers, and two of those papers were named, the Free-
</p>
<p>man's Journal, of which Dr. Gray is the proprietor, and the Pilot,
</p>
<p>of which Mr. Barrett is the proprietor. These were the papers
</p>
<p>named ; and if a certain number thought fit to choose another
</p>
<p>paper, and gave directions for that purpose, that they should be
</p>
<p>furnished accordingly; that is, another paper of the same side of
</p>
<p>politics.
</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen of the Jury, you will consider what the effect
</p>
<p>of these papers was, circulated all over Ireland. The people of
</p>
<p>the country, the poor people who had subscribed their shilling a
</p>
<p>year, which amounts to about a farthing a week; these people
</p>
<p>were to be enlightened by the dissemination of these papers, the
</p>
<p>Repeal Wardens taking care that they should read them, or have
</p>
<p>them read to them ; and for that purpose, the instructions that I
</p>
<p>have here in print before me, give directions, that, if not very in-
</p>
<p>convenient, small places and rooms, in the way of reading rooms,
</p>
<p>should be selected in each district, where members of the Society
</p>
<p>might assemble, for the purpose no doubt of being indoctrinated
</p>
<p>in the system and objects of the Society ; a society for the diffusion
</p>
<p>of useful knowledge ; the governing principle which actuated the
</p>
<p>entire being in Dublin ; the constant residence, as I may say, of
</p>
<p>the Association. Now when you come to think of what the in-
</p>
<p>dictment is, these are matters that ought not to be kept, or per-
</p>
<p>mitted to go, out of your view, but ought to be kept constantly
</p>
<p>before you. Recollect what is complained of by the Crown; a
</p>
<p>conspiracy by means of intimidation, and by the demonstration of
</p>
<p>physical force, to procure changes in the laws and government,
</p>
<p>and to overawe the legislature of the country. It is for your con-
</p>
<p>sideration, Gentlemen, to say, is anything done towards that end by
</p>
<p>an organization of the entire people of the country, or three-fourths
</p>
<p>of them, in constant communication with head quarters, acting
</p>
<p>under their general orders, embarked with them in a common
</p>
<p>cause, by the advance of their little means, to be applied by irres-
</p>

<p>this, that it is to go to the National Association.
</p>
<p>Well, the nature of the card under which the people were ad-
</p>
<p>mitted, which they preserved as a sign or token of their being mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the Association, has been so minutely detailed to you, and
</p>
<p>as you will have an opportunity of seeing before you in your jury
</p>
<p>box those cards, I do not think it is necessary to occupy your's, or
</p>
<p>the public time, by much observation upon them. They were of
</p>
<p>three kinds: the'eommon one, or the Associates'; the green one,
</p>
<p>the Members'; the other one, which is a fancy piece rather, the
</p>
<p>Volunteers'. And then, for fear the members should not under-
</p>
<p>stand fully the particular nature of their cards, an explanation of
</p>
<p>them is given, which was written by a gentleman of the name  I
</p>
<p>do not think his name appears here, but he is called in this, " the
</p>
<p>author of the Green Book." Now you will understand by-and-by,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, if you do not already, the bearings and tendency of that
</p>
<p>Green Book ; vou will have to consider it in connexion witli the
</p>
<p>832
</p>
<p>charge imputed to the traversers, of an endeavour (o corrupt the
</p>
<p>army, or to render them disaffected ; lie is the person who gave
</p>
<p>that printed explanation. My brother Crampton corrects me most,
</p>
<p>properly, by saying that the Green Book is not a book to which I
</p>
<p>ought to have alluded ; but certain letters upon the subject of the
</p>
<p>army, and addressed to the army, were written by the author of
</p>
<p>the Green Book, and, therefore, it comes pretty nearly to the same
</p>
<p>thing, the author of the Letters to the Army being the same per-
</p>
<p>son as the author of the Green Book, and he is the person who, for
</p>
<p>the Association, gives this explanation, particularly of this card
</p>
<p>which is called the Members' card, the green card. Now, Gentle-
</p>
<p>men of the Jury, this is contained in a letter to the Secretary of the
</p>
<p>Loyal National Repeal Association : " Explanation of the New
</p>
<p>" Card for Members, by the Author of the Green Book. Printed
</p>
<p>" for circulation by order of the Committee of the Association, the
</p>
<p>" 11th of April, 1843." It is printed by their direction; and there
</p>
<p>is at the bottom of it this statement; it is directed to " T. M. Ray,
</p>
<p>Esq., the Secretary." " This letter, the reading of which elicited
</p>
<p>" the repeated acclamations of the meeting, was enrolled upon the
</p>
<p>" minutes of the Association, on the motion of Mr. O'Connell."
</p>
<p>And thus it becan e the act, to all intents and purposes, of the As-
</p>
<p>sociation itself. Now it is very long, Gentlemen of the Jury, and
</p>
<p>I do not wish to go through a detail of it, because you will have
</p>
<p>an opportunity of having the instrument sent up to you, and you
</p>
<p>will see its bearings, and see whether it supports, or the contrary,
</p>
<p>the explanations and observations that have been made upon it by
</p>
<p>the Solicitor-General; I think also by the Attorney-General, but I
</p>
<p>allude particularly to the Solicitor-General, because he is more re-
</p>
<p>cently within your recollection. It is, however, necessary for me
</p>
<p>just to mention this; you will see from its general nature that it is
</p>
<p>a statement and an enumeration of many circumstances.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore Your Lordship will excuse me for one moment. I
</p>
<p>understood your Lordship to say, that you would not read some of
</p>
<p>these documents at full length, or so much as your Lordship other-

</p>
<p>wise might, as they were to go to the Jury. I hope your Lord-
</p>
<p>ships will not consider, in making that observation, that the coun-
</p>
<p>sel for the traversers are consenting to the documents going to the
</p>
<p>Jury.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  Very well ; if you think proper to
</p>
<p>object, of course they shall not.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore.  We do not wish to preclude ourselves from adopt-
</p>
<p>ing any course which we may think right at the conclusion of the
</p>
<p>charge; but I merely mention it in order that your Lordships
</p>
<p>should not think we might be consenting to it. It might be after-
</p>
<p>wards open to the observation that we did not object to it.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  You are quite right, Mr. Moore,
</p>
<p>in saying so. Then, Gentlemen, I have no right to assume that
</p>
<p>these documents are to be laid before you, that is, are to go into
</p>
<p>your box ; that makes it the more necessary for me to make a tew
</p>
<p>observations on them, and in general my intention is not to go into
</p>
<p>833
</p>
<p>minuteness of detail, but to give you generally a correct notion
</p>
<p>of what the documents are, and to leave the subject then to your
</p>
<p>consideration. If I mistake or misstate the general object, the
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of course will correct me. Now, Gentlemen, this was
</p>
<p>the general object of this Members' card. Upon the face of it is
</p>
<p>inserted in green colours an enumeration of the powers, population,
</p>
<p>and ability of Ireland to have a Parliament of her own ; and it con-
</p>
<p>cludes with a sort of chorus, "And yet she has no Parliament."
</p>
<p>Now whether she should have a Parliament or not, does not de-
</p>
<p>pend upon Mr. O'Connell and the Association. He may, and no
</p>
<p>doubt does, in common with very many who are of the same opinion
</p>
<p>with him, think conscientiously that she ought to haveaParliament;
</p>
<p>I do not dispute at all his entertaining that opinion, he and they
</p>
<p>have a perfect right to entertain it; I do not mean to say that he
</p>
<p>and they are right or wrong. That is not the question ; you have
</p>
<p>nothing to do with whether they are to have a Parliament or not;
</p>
<p>you are not to give it  it is to be done by the regular constitution
</p>
<p>of this kingdom, this United Kingdom, the King, Lords, and Com-
</p>
<p>mons of this kingdom ; and to disseminate upon the face of these
</p>
<p>cards, that from their strength and consequence they ought to have
</p>
<p>a Parliament and have not  that is taking upon himself, or taking
</p>
<p>upon the Association themselves, to disseminate through every
</p>
<p>part of the country a statement of matter, upon which they, the
</p>
<p>members of the Association, have no right to make a decision.
</p>
<p>They may give an opinion, they may circulate their opinion, they
</p>
<p>may endeavour to support it; they have a right to state what they
</p>
<p>call their grievances ; and if they can enlist popular opinion in their
</p>
<p>favour by fair means, by legitimate means, they are perfectly en-
</p>
<p>titled to do so ; but, upon the other hand, it is to be considered,
</p>
<p>when they are enrolling the whole country under stated officers,
</p>
<p>Repeal Wardens and Repeal Inspectors, and these cards are given
</p>
<p>and circulated, to be placed by those officers in the hands of the
</p>
<p>persons whom they get together as conscripts; why, Gentlemen of
</p>
<p>the Jury, it is for you to consider with what intention that is done.

</p>
<p>Is it with the fair intention of free discussion, candid, deliberate
</p>
<p>opinion? oris it with the intention of banding the persons, among
</p>
<p>whom these cards are distributed, and these newspapers are circu-
</p>
<p>lated  banding them in favour of a particular form of political
</p>
<p>views, entertained either by Mr. O'Connell, or by the members of
</p>
<p>that Association ? And is that intention to be furthered with the
</p>
<p>view of promoting free political discussion, or is it intended to be
</p>
<p>promoted by the enrolling of additional members to be confederated
</p>
<p>in one general object, the nature and particulars of which they do

<p>subscriptions are to be applied they do not know ? Is it, or is it

<p>SATURDAY, February 10, 1844.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.
</p>
<p>Before I resume this case, Gentlemen of the Jury, I would wish
</p>
<p>to say a word with regard to some expressions that fell from me
</p>
<p>yesterday relative to Mr. Fitzgibbon. It has been occurring to me
</p>
<p>since, that perhaps I may have expressed myself in a way that
</p>
<p>might have appeared somewhat harsh with regard to him personally.
</p>
<p>In what I did say I was obliged and called upon to express myself
</p>
<p>very explicitly respecting the law of conspiracy, as we, the Court,
</p>
<p>entertain it, different from the way in which Mr. Fitzgibbon had
</p>
<p>laid it down. I was called upon so to express the opinion of the
</p>
<p>Court, but in the expressions that I made use of I certainly never
</p>
<p>did intend, in the slightest degree, to say anything at all disrespect-
</p>
<p>ful of Mr. Fitzgibbon personally ; on the contrary, before I go on
</p>
<p>With the case, I take the opportunity of saying, that for Mr. Fitz-
</p>
<p>gibbon himself, his public and private character, I entertain a very
</p>
<p>great esteem, if he will give me leave to say so, and as to his talents,
</p>
<p>his industry, and his acquirements, I hold them in very great re-
</p>
<p>spect. Having said so much, I have disburlhened my conscience of
</p>
<p>having made use of anything like an unguarded expression with
</p>
<p>respect to Mr. Fitzgibbon ; and now, Gentlemen, we will go on
</p>
<p>with the case.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, yesterday evening I concluded by making some
</p>
<p>observations with regard to the state of organization, the appoint-
</p>
<p>ment of officers, and so forth, which it was proved had taken place
</p>
<p>in the year 1843, in respect of the Association, and I took the li-
</p>
<p>berty of calling your attention to those matters, inasmuch as it ap-
</p>
<p>peared to me, that they had a very considerable bearing upon one
</p>
<p>or more of the questions to be submitted to you on the trial of this
</p>
<p>indictment. In addition to what I said yesterday, as a further in-
</p>
<p>stance of the power and weight of this Association, and of its for-
</p>
<p>midable character, with respect to those who did not belong to it,
</p>
<p>besides the income derived from the different persons who had
</p>
<p>become, and might become, Members or Associates of it, I would

</p>
<p>call your attention further to the circumstance of the large sums of
</p>
<p>money which were contributed from various places both abroad
</p>
<p>and at home, swelling to a great magnitude the funds, or the Ex-
</p>
<p>chequer, as I believe Mr. Duffy calls it, of this Association. It
</p>
<p>is in proof, Gentlemen of the Jury, that from day to day, from sit-
</p>
<p>ting to sitting, large funds were handed in from different places in
</p>
<p>England, in Scotland, and several parts of Ireland, and various
</p>
<p>sums from different parts of America ; not only the part of America
</p>
<p>under the British sway and dominion, which might be thoughttohave
</p>
<p>some personal or particular interest in what is going on here, but
</p>
<p>also from different parts of the United States, which, with regard to
</p>
<p>Great Britain and Ireland, are foreign countries, Now those sums
</p>
<p>were handed in and contributed in large and considerable amounts;
</p>
<p>you have for that the incontrovertible evidence of Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>835
</p>
<p>himself, and the different members, and the proceedings of the
</p>
<p>Association as they have been laid before you. And when Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell is speaking of the forces he has at his command, and
</p>
<p>of those who are acting under his control, which he does on more
</p>
<p>than one occasion, he takes the opportunity of recording the in-
</p>
<p>creasing amount of funds which he was receiving, or the Associa-
</p>
<p>tion was receiving, from the sympathy and support of America;
</p>
<p>and he says, in one instance, he was going to Dublin the next day,
</p>
<p>and he would hand in to the Association a sum of upwards of
</p>
<p>l 100 which he had received from America for the purpose. The
</p>
<p>Association, thus organized, thus disciplined, thus provided with
</p>
<p>funds, with numbers unexampled, is the instrument in Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell's hands for the working out of that which he professes to be
</p>
<p>the end and object of the Association. He and the other traversers
</p>
<p>by their various counsel make the case that this is all legitimate,
</p>
<p>and inasmuch as they have a right to complain of the existence of
</p>
<p>the Union as a grievance, they have a right hy all legal means to
</p>
<p>get rid of the existence of that grievance; and so far the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General concurs with them. And the question merely between
</p>
<p>them is, whether the means resorted to in the furtherance of the
</p>
<p>objects of the traversers be or be not legal, or whether, in pursuing
</p>
<p>their objects by the methods which they have adopted, they have
</p>
<p>not agreed and concurred to transgress the law, in the manner in
</p>
<p>which the Attorney-General accuses them in the present indict-
</p>
<p>ment. Now as far as I know, the legal means would be by ad-
</p>
<p>dresses to the Queen, or to the Parliament as by law established.
</p>
<p>They might do more ; they might, by the introduction of free and
</p>
<p>fair discussion give weight and extent to their opinions with regard
</p>
<p>to the question of the Union. But to do that there must be no in-
</p>
<p>timidation ; that is inconsistent with free discussion. There must be
</p>
<p>no demonstration of physical force for the purpose of overawing
</p>
<p>or intimidating Her Majesty's Ministers, or those who have the di-
</p>
<p>rection of public affairs; and still less have they a right to take the
</p>
<p>law into their own hands, and by their own act make an alteration

</p>
<p>in the constitution and laws of the country, different from that
</p>
<p>which exists since the Union ; a law which has been passed by the
</p>
<p>Sovereign and Legislature of the country at the time.
</p>
<p>Now having called your attention to the state of. power, and
</p>
<p>organization, and discipline to which they had carried that Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation, and its connexions, see what their acts are in furtherance
</p>
<p>of what they call their legal intentions of carrying out their object.
</p>
<p>The next instrument that I call your attention to, is an instrument
</p>
<p>that was laid before the Association on the 22nd of August, 1843,
</p>
<p>and it is called " A Plan for the renewed Action of the Irish Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment." Now I have already very explicitly told you, that as long
</p>
<p>as the Act of Union remained unaltered by the proper authority, the
</p>
<p>Queen was bound by her Coronation Oath to support it, and no set
</p>
<p>of persons in this country had a right, either by their demonstration
</p>
<p>of numbers, or power, or otherwise, to attempt to make an alteration
</p>
<p>in that law except through the medium of the legitimate authority;
</p>
<p>836
</p>
<p>the Sovereign and Parliament of the country. Here is the Associa-
</p>
<p>tion plan for making a new law and a new Constitution in that part
</p>
<p>of the United Kingdom called Ireland. " A Plan for the renewed
</p>
<p>" Action of thelrish Parliament  First, the Irish people recognize,
</p>
<p>" acknowledge, and maintain, and will conliniudly uphold and
</p>
<p>' preserve upon the throne of Ireland, Her Majesty Queen Victoria,
</p>
<p>" whom God protect ; Queen by undoubted right, and by heredi-
</p>
<p>" tary descent, of Ireland, and her heirs and successors for ever."
</p>
<p>From the time of passing the Act of Union, and now up to this
</p>
<p>day, she ceased to be Queen of Ireland. The King at that time,
</p>
<p>and his successors since, ceased to be distinct Kings and Queens of
</p>
<p>Ireland; by the effect of the Act of Union Ireland was swallowed up in
</p>
<p>the United Kingdom, and the previous sovereign ceased to be King
</p>
<p>or Queen of Ireland, but King or Queen of the United Kingdom of
</p>
<p>Great Britain and Ireland. This proposal, therefore, is a plan for
</p>
<p>an entire alteration in the Constitution and law of this country as by
</p>
<p>law established. It is a plan to propose in lieu of it, placing Her
</p>
<p>Majesty, the undoubted Queen of the United Kingdom, in a sepa-
</p>
<p>rate situation as Queen of Ireland, which she could not then be-
</p>
<p>come, without the consent and concurrence of the Legislature of
</p>
<p>the United Kingdom, together with the sanction of the Throne.
</p>
<p>Then it goes on to say :-- " The people of Ireland recognize, ac-
</p>
<p>" knowledge, maintain, and will continually preserve and uphold
</p>
<p>" all the prerogatives of Her Majesty, and of her heirs and succes-
</p>
<p>" sors, belonging to and inherent in the imperial crown of Ireland ;
</p>
<p>" and they will true allegiance bear, pure, undivided, and undivi-
</p>
<p>" sible to Her Majesty, her heirs and successors for ever. Se-
</p>
<p>" condly, the people of Ireland acknowledge, and will maintain
</p>
<p>" and preserve for ever, the privileges, hereditary and personal, of
</p>
<p>" the Peers of Ireland, together with the legislative and judicial
</p>
<p>" authority of the Irish House of Lords, and the exercise of the
</p>
<p>" prerogative in augmenting and limiting the peerage, as the
</p>
<p>" same did of right exist before the year 1800. Thirdly, the peo-
</p>
<p>" pie of Ireland do firmly insist upon the restoration of the Irish

</p>
<p>" House of Commons, consisting of three hundred representatives
</p>
<p>" of the Irish people, and claim, in the presence of their Creator,
</p>
<p>" the right of the people of Ireland to such restoration." Now,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you will have to say, is that the language of petition,
</p>
<p>either to the Legislature of the country as now by law established,
</p>
<p>or is it the language of petition to the Queen of the United King-
</p>
<p>dom as by law established, or is it the language of petition at all ?
</p>
<p>Or is is it rather a demand ? The tone, the language used ; is it in
</p>
<p>the nature of a petition, oris it in the nature of a demand which the
</p>
<p>people insist on as their right, this demand coming from that As-
</p>
<p>sociation, which at that time included, or was composed of, as
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell has stated elsewhere, something near three quarters
</p>
<p>of the entire population of Ireland ; banded together by means
</p>
<p>of this Association for a common purpose, in which each person,
</p>
<p>without distinctly knowing what it was, had committed and
</p>
<p>bound himself, more or less, by advancing money in its support.
</p>
<p>837
</p>
<p>" Fourthly, the plan for the restoration of the Irish Parliament is
</p>
<p>" as follows :  Firstly, that the county members should be in-
</p>
<p>" creased to one hundred and seventy three, in the manner here-
</p>
<p>" in-after specified. Secondly, that there should be one hundred
</p>
<p>" and twenty- seven members returned from cities and towns, in
</p>
<p>" the manner herein-after mentioned. Thirdly, that the county of
</p>
<p>" Carlo w, being the only county in Ireland with less than one hun-
</p>
<p>" dred thousand inhabitants, should get an increase of one member,
</p>
<p>** so as to have three representatives ; that every other county having
</p>
<p>" above one hundred thousand inhabitants should get an increase
</p>
<p>" of two members ; that every county ranging above one hundred
</p>
<p>"and fifty thousand inhabitants should get .an increase of three
</p>
<p>" members ; that every county ranging above two hundred and fifty
</p>
<p>" thousand inhabitants should get an increase of four members."
</p>
<p>And so he goes on with the other counties, according to their size
</p>
<p>and increase in inhabitants, And then there is: "The following
</p>
<p>" schedule of the different places to return members to the Irish
</p>
<p>" Parliament will show their relative population, and the number
</p>
<p>" of members to be assigned to each." I need not go through the
</p>
<p>particulars of that schedule. " Sixthly.  It is proposed that the
</p>
<p>" right of voting should be what is called ' household suffrage,'
</p>
<p>" requiring six mouths' residence in the counties, with the addition
</p>
<p>" in the towns of married men, resident for twelve months, whether
</p>
<p>" householders or not. Seventhly.  It is proposed that the mode
</p>
<p>" of voting for members of Parliament should certainly be by bal-
</p>
<p>" lot. Eighthly.  The Monarch de facto of England at all times
</p>
<p>" hereafter, whosoever he may be, shall be Monarch de jure in Ire-
</p>
<p>" land ; and so, in case of a future regency, the regent de facto in
</p>
<p>" England to be regent de jure in Ireland. Ninthly.  The con-
</p>
<p>" nexion between Great Britain and Ireland, by means of the power,
</p>
<p>" authority, and perogative of the Crown"  not in any other way 
</p>
<p>" to be perpetual, and incapable of change, or any severance or se-
</p>
<p>" paration. The foregoing plan to be carried into effect according
</p>
<p>u to recognized law and strict constitutional principle." What that

</p>
<p>may be is not defined, nor do I see how such a plan as that, essen-
</p>
<p>tially in opposition to, and in violation of the Coronation Oath, and
</p>
<p>of the Act of Union, as at present existing, could be carried into
</p>
<p>effect according to " recognized law and strict constitutional prin-
</p>
<p>ciple. It is utterly impossible to do it in the existing state of
</p>
<p>things. There is a way in which the Union may be altered if the
</p>
<p>legislative wisdom of the country, together with the Crown, should
</p>
<p>think fit to adopt it ; that is, if the Parliament of the United King-
</p>
<p>dom, with the concurrence and sanction of the Crown, think proper
</p>
<p>to pass a new Act of Parliament, either repealing the Union, or mo-
</p>
<p>difying it as it at present stands with regard to the connexion be-
</p>
<p>tween Ireland and Great Britain ; that is the legitimate mode of
</p>
<p>doing it; but as long as the law stands as at present, there is the
</p>
<p>Queen's Coronation Oath to be violated, if it be attempted to be
</p>
<p>done, and there is the violation of the Statute of the fortieth of
</p>
<p>George the Third, which it expressly endeavours thus to defeat and

<p>do away with. Now, there is no attempt made for petition to the
</p>
<p>Crown; there is no suggestion for petitioning the United Legisla-
</p>
<p>ture; nothing of that kind is attempted ; but it is the demand of
</p>
<p>the people of Ireland, organized and disciplined as they were at
</p>
<p>that time, which they require to have carried into effect according
</p>
<p>to their wishes and desires, by whom or how I do not know, nor
</p>
<p>does the plan specify. However, Gentlemen of the Jury, that plan
</p>
<p>was laid before the Association ; it does not appear that that plan
</p>
<p>was rejected. And then, what were the Association doing in the
</p>
<p>mean time, while this authoritative demand on behalf of the people
</p>
<p>of Ireland was thus put upon the records of the Association!' 1
</p>
<p>shall leave to you, Gentlemen, to say the true character of that in
</p>
<p>which they were engaged, whether it was a continuance of the same
</p>
<p>sort of system, or whether it was, as they allege it tobe, a peaceable
</p>
<p>mode of obtaining public opinion, and introducing or spreading free
</p>
<p>discussion upon political topics.
</p>
<p>They thought proper to have meetings held in different parts
</p>
<p>of Ireland. Now those meetinp-s are called by Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>"Monster Meetings;" and though it is not admitted here, that
</p>
<p>he or the Association called more than a few of those Monster
</p>
<p>Meetings, yet you will see, Gentlemen of the Jury, by the re-
</p>
<p>ported declarations of Mr. O'Connell himself, that he or ive, that
</p>
<p>is, he or the Association, did call those Monster Meetings; and
</p>
<p>you will have to say whether or not this is another way, and a more
</p>
<p>public way, of demonstrating the existing physical force, and pow-
</p>
<p>erful strength of the Irish nation, banded together by the ties of the
</p>
<p>Association for effecting their object, by such means as the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General has alluded to. I am not about to go through a detail
</p>
<p>of all the meetings that took place in the different parts of Ireland ;
</p>
<p>they have been stated to you by the Attorney, and by the Solicitor-
</p>
<p>General, and with regard to the existence, and the actual taking
</p>
<p>place, of those great assemblies or Monster Meetings, there is no diffe-
</p>
<p>rence between the Crown and the traversers. That such meetings
</p>
<p>were assembled, were brought together, and that they did take place

</p>
<p>under the circumstances that have been described, it would seem
</p>
<p>that both parties are agreed. I do not lay much stress upon the
</p>
<p>fact of there being bands of music. There were bands of music in
</p>
<p>almost every instance, perhaps in every instance, and those bands
</p>
<p>of music were in very great numbers  thirty or forty different bands
</p>
<p>ofmusicata single meeting. There were flags, and there were
</p>
<p>banners, and there were inscriptions. But, Gentlemen of the Jury,
</p>
<p>I do not lay much stress upon that ; even though in some cases a
</p>
<p>violence of expression might appear upon some of those devices,
</p>
<p>they go but a little way to establish the crime imputed, that is, the
</p>
<p>attempt by intimidation and by demonstration of physical power to
</p>
<p>overawe the councils of the nation. Those bands are a little thing
</p>
<p>in consideration. They may in some measure relate to the question
</p>
<p>of organization and discipline, something contributary more or less
</p>
<p>to the existence of physical force, but the striking feature in the
</p>
<p>839
</p>
<p>meetings is, the immense masses in which the people were collect-
</p>
<p>ed, and the nature and violence of the speeches made to the assem-
</p>
<p>bled multitudes on these occasions. Generally those speeches were
</p>
<p>made by Mr. Daniel O'Connell, but he was not alone or singular in
</p>
<p>being the person who addressed the multitudes. There are other
</p>
<p>persons also included now amongst the traversers, who availed
</p>
<p>themselves of the opportunity afforded of making their sentiments
</p>
<p>known to the assembled multitudes. You will say, Gentlemen of
</p>
<p>the Jury, whether from the nature of those speeches they were acting
</p>
<p>in pursuance or promotion of a common design, and that a crimi-
</p>
<p>nal one; it will be for you to judge on this point. From a few of
</p>
<p>the speeches I shall take the liberty of selecting some passages for
</p>
<p>your consideration. The first of those is the one of the 15th of
</p>
<p>May, at Mullingar; that was attended by Mr. O'Connell and by
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett. Now that assembly was composed of multitudes of
</p>
<p>persons, amounting to hundreds of thousands, brought together from
</p>
<p>various quarters, preceded by bands and banners; and to them
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett, in the way, I suppose, of free discussion upon the sub-
</p>
<p>ject of the Repeal of the Uuion, and the spreading of free, popular,
</p>
<p>peaceable opinion, thought proper to make this speech. After some
</p>
<p>observations which I need not repeat : " With such a cause, with
</p>
<p>" such a leader, the people and clergy on our side, who will de-
</p>
<p>" spair ?" There was then renewed cheering. Now you will observe.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I am reading this from the Pilot paper of the ISthofMay.
</p>
<p>This is Mr. Barrett's own paper. He cannot disarm whatever there
</p>
<p>may be of guilt, or criminality, or violence, in the speech so made,
</p>
<p>upon the representation or assertion that it came out unpremedi-
</p>
<p>tatedly, on the occasion of the moment ; that it was a hot effusion,
</p>
<p>for which perhaps he might be guilty of a breach of decorum or good
</p>
<p>manners, but the thing should be passed over because it was unpre-
</p>
<p>meditated. He not only spoke the speech at Mullingar, but I take
</p>
<p>for granted that he wrote that speech down, and certainly after he
</p>
<p>came to Dublin he had it printed and published and circulated in
</p>
<p>his own paper, the Pilot. This is not a chance speech, a heated

</p>
<p>effusion which a man may let out and afterwards be sorry for ; no, it
</p>
<p>is the premeditated speech of this gentleman, first spoken delibe-
</p>
<p>rately in presence of hundreds of thousands of people, or at least a
</p>
<p>great multitude, and afterwards deliberately put into print, printed
</p>
<p>by himself, by his own authority, and then issued to the public and
</p>
<p>circulated abroad: " If Ireland has missed former opportunities of
</p>
<p>" regeneration, that is only a warning not to miss others. The
</p>
<p>*' moment has arrived. Let us seize on the present, and take care
</p>
<p>" that this neglected moment may not become the regretted past of
</p>
<p>" a future day. [Cheers]. Irishmen, proceed then in the mighty
</p>
<p>" work before you. [Renewed cheers]. Persevere, and you triumph;
</p>
<p>" hesitate, and you fail"  or fall, I do not know which it is  "to
</p>
<p>" recede were ruin. [Cheers]. To suppose you will neglect your
</p>
<p>" present opportunity, would be to suppose you would ungratefully
</p>
<p>" [I believe it is] neglect that cup of national independence and
</p>
<p>" prosperity, which, Providence, in its mercy, seems at last to
</p>
<p>840
</p>
<p>t( have presented to your parched and feverish lips. [Tremendous
</p>
<p>" cheering]-" Then there is another passage in the same speech,
</p>
<p>which will show you what was intended. " They have proved al-
</p>
<p>" ready, that Ireland is of one mind, and that mind Repeal. [Cheers].
</p>
<p>" Can they unrepeal us by silencing us ? No ; we know  England
</p>
<p>" now knows  Europe knows  and the world knows  that Ireland
</p>
<p>" is united. How will they destroy that admitted fact, or efface
</p>
<p>" its record ? We may be silent, but all the time it will be the si-
</p>
<p>" lence of the old woman's cow. [Laughter]. We shall be the
</p>
<p>" devil for thinking. Yes, the silence of gunpowder, smooth on
</p>
<p>" the surface, only indicating the depth of the waters beneath." Is
</p>
<p>that the introduction of free discussion, the introduction of fair opi-
</p>
<p>nion ? '* We will crouch, but it will be the crouch of the tiger,
</p>
<p>" ready to take the sure, but terrible spring, and clutch our inde-
</p>
<p>" pendence. Come what may, the die is cast  Repeal must be
</p>
<p>" successful. We have a leader worthy of our people, and a peo-
</p>
<p>" pie worthy of such a leader. A people sober, forbearing, resolv-
</p>
<p>'.' ed, and possessing all the virtues which will enable them to ob-
</p>
<p>" tain, by showing that they are worthy of national independence."
</p>
<p>For the dissemination of these views and these sentiments, Mr. Bar-
</p>
<p>rett attended that meeting, made that public display and exhibition,
</p>
<p>and afterwards took the further measure of disseminating his views,
</p>
<p>as far as his paper was circulated. That was on the 15th of May ;
</p>
<p>and you see how simultaneously those operations in the Association,
</p>
<p>and those meetings, and all those proceedings went on.
</p>
<p>The next I shall read to you is the Pilot of the 31st May  another
</p>
<p>paper also of Mr. Barrett's. He gives you in this paper the speech of
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell at the great meeting at Longford, which was held on
</p>
<p>the 28th of May, 1843. You recollect, Gentlemen, I dare say, a
</p>
<p>good deal that was stated at that meeting by Mr. O'Connell with
</p>
<p>respect to an English nobleman, a Roman Catholic nobleman,
</p>
<p>Lord Beaumont. Now there was unquestionably a great deal of
</p>
<p>personal abuse by Mr. O'Connell of Lord Beaumont, and very
</p>
<p>possibly (from Mr. O'Connell having complained of it), improper

</p>
<p>and heated language had taken place in England on the part of
</p>
<p>Lord Beaumont, when he was speaking of Mr. O'Connell. I am
</p>
<p>not intending to trouble you by going into particulars of those dis-
</p>
<p>putes between those two individuals ; be that as it may ; but I in-
</p>
<p>troduce this for the purpose of showing you what it was that Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell threw out at this meeting, with regard to what might
</p>
<p>take place in England, if opposition were made to his plans, or
</p>
<p>those of the Association, acting as they were in the assembling and
</p>
<p>collecting of those multitudes. " I ask you, mongrel, heartless
</p>
<p>" Beaumont, do you want it to go through the people of Ireland,
</p>
<p>" that you would support the English Minister if he had been mad
</p>
<p>" enough to make war upon the Catholics of Ireland ? Suppose
</p>
<p>" some Irish Paddy had escaped from the slaughter, and going
</p>
<p>"over to London had met some one of his former neighbours ;
</p>
<p>" they would ask him the news, but what would be the tidings he
</p>
<p>" would have to bring (hem ? He should say to one, ' Jemmy, your
</p>
<p>841
</p>
<p>" father has been killed ;' to another, ' Tom, your brother has been
</p>
<p>" shot.' A third would ask, * but my sister Eleanor, does she live ?'
</p>
<p>*' He would say,  your sister is not dead.' ' But is my father alive?'
</p>
<p>" 'No, your si^tc/ watched his corpse, but she is herself worse than
</p>
<p>" ' dead ; she is now a sad maniac, roaming through the wilds, and
</p>
<p>" ' like the wretched maniac of sons:, warning- her sex against the
</p>
<p>" ' ruffian soldiery of Britain.' " You recollect, one of the counts
</p>
<p>in this indictment accused the traversers of endeavouring- to excite
</p>
<p>hatred and discontent amongst Her Majesty's subjects, particularly
</p>
<p>the Irish people against the English. There is the first instance
</p>
<p>that I have read to you  a defined and specified instance  which
</p>
<p>must go directly, if at all, and if believed, in support of that charge.
</p>
<p>It is for you to say, Gentlemen of the Jury, whether you think that,
</p>
<p>is a part of free discussion; whether you think that is a fair and
</p>
<p>legitimate mode of bringing to bear the weight of popular opinion
</p>
<p>in favour of a change of political questions ; or is it, as laid in the
</p>
<p>indictment, a part of a system, in which two or more combined, for the
</p>
<p>purpose of raising hatred, and disaffection, and discontent, amongst
</p>
<p>one class of Her Majesty's subjects against another? "Yes, my Lord
</p>
<p>" Beaumont, the brother of Ellen O'Moore would be near your castle ;
</p>
<p>" he would hear that you were one of the men who hallooed on the
</p>
<p>" destroyers of the peace of his home. Oh ! you would be very
</p>
<p>" safe that evening, would you not, Lord Beaumont ? The manu-
</p>
<p>" factories in your neighbourhood would be safe too; and proud
</p>
<p>" London herself, in which you would flatter yourself with the
</p>
<p>" hope of being secure, would be also safe, when the account of the
</p>
<p>" ruin of Ireland would arrive." This was something existing in
</p>
<p>the mind and imagination of Mr. O'Connell, who framed and fabri-
</p>
<p>cated this story for the purpose of having its effect. No such story
</p>
<p>ever existed; but it was a supposition, a kind of novel, invented by
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell on the occasion : and for what purpose? To have
</p>
<p>free discussion upon the subject of the Union ? or to have the pas-
</p>
<p>sions of one part of the country excited against another, and vio-
</p>
<p>lence provoked by the introduction of an unfounded story of that

<p>nature? He said: " No, one blaze of powerful fire would reach
</p>
<p>" through her vast extent, and in the destruction of England, would
</p>
<p>" vindicate the country of the maddened and persecuted Irishman
</p>
<p>" who would have reached her shores. [Cheers]." That is the way
</p>
<p>in which a story of that nature is received by the multitudes of
</p>
<p>Longford. Is that a singular instance of the means that were re-
</p>
<p>sorted to at those monster meetings, for the purpose of producing
</p>
<p>those ends, which the persons had in view who caused them to as-
</p>
<p>semble ? Now I am going to read another passage ; you will judge
</p>
<p>whether it be or be not of a piece with what you have heard before.
</p>
<p>On the 14th of June, 1843, there is the Freeman s Journal (this
</p>
<p>is Dr. Gray's paper), and the paper I have in my hand was read in
</p>
<p>the progress of the trial. Dr. Gray, in his paper of the 14th of
</p>
<p>June, has thought proper to publish a speech of Mr. O'Connell's,
</p>
<p>as given at a dinner at Mallow, which had taken place about two
</p>
<p>days before. " Mr. O Connell rose, and was received with most
</p>
<p>5p
</p>
<p>842
</p>
<p>" tremendous bursts of applause, which were repeated at least half a
</p>
<p>" dozen times. After the lapse of some minutes, when order had been
</p>
<p>" restored, the learned gentleman proceeded to speak as follows :
</p>
<p>" ' My friend, Counsellor Maguire, made an excellent speech  I
</p>
<p>" ' think one of the most effective I ever heard  powerful in dic-
</p>
<p>" ' tion  strong in imagery, and above all, transcendant in the out-
</p>
<p>" ' burstings of genius and patriotism. It was, in a word, a most
</p>
<p>" ' excellent speech. But yet, do you know, I never felt such a
</p>
<p>" ' loathing for speechifying as I do at present. The time is come
</p>
<p>" ' when we must be doing. Gentlemen, you may soon learn the
</p>
<p>" ' alternative  to live as slaves, or to die as freemen : no, you will
</p>
<p>" ' not be freemen if you be not perfectly in the right, and your
</p>
<p>" ' enemies in the wrong.' ' Now the word " enemy" occurs very
</p>
<p>often in many of the speeches made by Mr. O'Connell, either in the
</p>
<p>presence of the other traversers or otherwise; made also by other
</p>
<p>persons amongst the traversers in their respective speeches. Whe-
</p>
<p>ther it be the word "enemy," or whether it be the contemptuous
</p>
<p>word " Saxon," it will be for you to say to whom is that designation
</p>
<p>attached ? Can it have a meaning of any other description than
</p>
<p>that of English ? That is for you to say. " I think I perceive a
</p>
<p>" fixed disposition on the part of some of our Saxon traducers to
</p>
<p>" put us to the test. The efforts already made by them have been
</p>
<p>" most abortive and ridiculous ; in the midst of peace and tranquil-
</p>
<p>" lity they are covering over our land with troops. Yes, I speak
</p>
<p>" with the awful determination with which I commenced my ad-
</p>
<p>" dress, in consequence of the news received this day. There was
</p>
<p>" no House of Commons on Thursday, for the Cabinet was consi-
</p>
<p>" dering what they should do  not for Ireland, but against her."
</p>
<p>Now it is true, as I before observed, that not only at the Associa-
</p>
<p>tion, but also, I believe, without exception, at all those public meet-
</p>
<p>ings, there was the most industrious inculcation not to violate the
</p>
<p>law. " He who commits a crime, gives strength to the enemy ;"
</p>
<p>that is the maxim, that is the motto ; and it will be for you to con-
</p>
<p>sider whether, upon the whole of the conduct, and demeanour, and

</p>
<p>speaking of the parties upon these occasions, they had in view ac-
</p>
<p>tually peaceful behaviour, or whether those warnings and that ad-
</p>
<p>vice were given for a particular purpose, to prevent the violation of
</p>
<p>the law, to restrain all violence, to abstain from all resistance to the
</p>
<p>law, until the time should be arrived when they would be prepared
</p>
<p>to make such a use of their existing force as circumstances might
</p>
<p>then suggest. " But, gentlemen, as long as they leave us a rag of
</p>
<p>" the Constitution we will stand to it. [Tremendous cheering.] We
</p>
<p>" will violate no law  we will assail no enemy, but you are much
</p>
<p>" mistaken if you think others will not assail you. [A voice, ' we
</p>
<p>" are ready to meet them.']" This is the state of temper which
</p>
<p>those meetings exhibited. " To be sure you are. [Cheers.] Do
</p>
<p>" you think I suppose you to be cowards or fools'? [Loud cheers.]
</p>
<p>" I am speaking of our being assailed. [Hear, hear.] Thursday
</p>
<p>" was spent in an endeavour to discover whether or not they should
</p>
<p>" use coercive measures. [Hear, and hisses]. Yes, coercive mea-
</p>
<p>843
</p>
<p>" sures  and on what pretext? Was Ireland ever in such a state
</p>
<p>" of" profound tranquillity*? [Cries of 'never.'] They sent their
</p>
<p>" armed steamers to Waterfbrd the other day, and when the army
</p>
<p>" arrived they found the key of the gaol missing, hecause the door
</p>
<p>M was not locked, there not being a single prisoner for trial with-
</p>
<p>" in it. [Laughter and cheers]. But, gentlemen, to leave this
</p>
<p>" subject, I hold that I would not be deserving of the station
</p>
<p>" I hold amongst you, if I disguised for a moment the magnitude
</p>
<p>" of the peril in which we are placed. Why were the troops sent
</p>
<p>" over here ? Why, from mis-information given to them by the
</p>
<p>" low vile Orangemen of former tyranny [groans], and it is through
</p>
<p>" the agency of the same materials that they now seek to coerce
</p>
<p>" us. [Cries of ' never,' and cheers.] They spent Thursday in
</p>
<p>" consulting whether they should deprive us of our rights, and I
</p>
<p>" know not what the result of that Council may be ; but this I
</p>
<p>" know, there was not an Irishman in the Council. I may be told
</p>
<p>" that the Duke of Wellington was there. [' Oh, oh,' and groans.]
</p>
<p>" Who calls him an Irishman? [Hisses and groans.] If a tiger's
</p>
<p>" cub was dropped in a fold woidd it be a lamb? [Hear and
</p>
<p>" cheers.] But perhaps I am wrong in anticipating, perhaps I am
</p>
<p>" mistaken in warning you [' no, no'] ; but is there not reason to
</p>
<p>" caution you ? [Cheers.] The Council sat for an entire day,
</p>
<p>" and even then did not conclude its deliberations, but adjourned
</p>
<p>" to the next day, while the business of the country was allowed
</p>
<p>" to stand still. " [Hear, hear.] What had they to deliberate
</p>
<p>"about? The Repealers were peaceable, loyal, and attached, af-
</p>
<p>" fectionately attached, to the Queen, and determined to stand
</p>
<p>" between her and her enemies. If they assailed us to-morrow,
</p>
<p>" and that we conquered them  as conquer them we will one day
</p>
<p>" [cheers], the first use of that victory which we would make
</p>
<p>" would be to place the sceptre in the hands of her who has ever
</p>
<p>" showed us favour,"  what power or right have they to do that ?
</p>
<p>" and whose conduct has ever been full of sympathy and emotion
</p>
<p>" for our sufferings. What I want you and them to understand

</p>
<p>" is, that we are sensible of the position in which we are placed
</p>
<p>" [cheers], that we have our apprehensions. By apprehensions I
</p>
<p>" do not mean fears. [Cheers.] But they are threatening us,
</p>
<p>" Irishmen, peaceful and tranquil, for what offence? An Act of
</p>
<p>" Parliament binding two countries together, is insisted to be re-
</p>
<p>" pealed by the Irish people. It was not a compact, but a fraud
</p>
<p>" and an imposition, and we are those that should have been parties
</p>
<p>" to the contract ; and let me ask you if any of your properties
</p>
<p>" were taken by fraud or violence, have you not a remedy in the
</p>
<p>" existing law ? [Hear, and cheers.] Suppose, then, for a mo-
</p>
<p>" ment, that England found the Act of Union to operate, not for
</p>
<p>" her benefit  if, instead of decreasing her debt, it added to her
</p>
<p>" taxation and liabilities, and made her burthens more onerous 
</p>
<p>" and if she felt herself entitled to call for a repeal of that Act, I
</p>
<p>" ask Peel and Wellington, and let them deny it if they dare, and
</p>
<p>" if they did they would be the scorn and the by-word of the
</p>
<p>844
</p>
<p>" world, would she not have a right to call for a repeal of that
</p>
<p>" Act?" She would, in a legitimate way. " What are Irishmen
</p>
<p>" that they should he denied an equal privilege? Have we not
</p>
<p>"the ordinary courage of Englishmen? Are we to he called
</p>
<p>" slaves ? [No, no.] Are we to be trampled under foot ? [No, no.]
</p>
<p>" Oh, they never shall trample me at least. [Tremendous cheer -
</p>
<p>" ing, that lasted for several minutes.] I was wrong; they may
</p>
<p>" trample me under foot. [' No, no, they never shall.'] I say,
</p>
<p>" they may trample me, but it will be my dead body they will
</p>
<p>" trample on  not the living man. [Cheers.] They have taken

<p>" one step of coercion, and may I not ask what is to prevent them
</p>
<p>"from taking another? If they take this step without pretext
</p>
<p>" before man, and, oh ! certainly without one before the Almighty,
</p>
<p>" if, I say, they take this step of coercion to deprive us of our
</p>
<p>" liberties for asking for a repeal of an Act, ought they not at once
</p>
<p>" make us their serfs ? [Hear, hear.] May they not send us to
</p>
<p>" the West Indies, as they have lately emancipated the negroes, to
</p>
<p>" fill up their places? [Hear.] Oh! it is not an imaginary case
</p>
<p>" at all ; for the only Englishman that ever possessed Ireland sent
</p>
<p>" eighty thousand Irishmen to work as slaves, every one of whom
</p>
<p>" perished in the short space of twelve years beneath the ungenial
</p>
<p>" sun of the Indies. [' Oh, oh,' and cheers.] Yes, Peel and Wel-
</p>
<p>" lington may be second Cromwells [loud hisses] ; they may get
</p>
<p>" his blunted truncheon, and they may, oh ! sacred Heaven ! en-
</p>
<p>" act on the fair occupants of that gallery [pointing to the ladies'
</p>
<p>" gallery], the murder of the Wexford ladies. But I am wrong;
</p>
<p>" they never shall. [Tremendous cheering and waving ofhand-
</p>
<p>" kerchiefs.]" This is all peaceable discussion, I suppose ! " What
</p>
<p>" alarms me is the progress of injustice. That ruffianly Saxon paper,
</p>
<p>" the Times, in the number received by me this day, presumes to
</p>
<p>" threaten us with such a fate [' oh ! oh !'] ; but let it not be sup-
</p>
<p>" posed, that I made that appeal to the ladies as a flight of my
</p>
<p>" imagination. No, the number of three hundred ladies, the beauty
</p>
<p>"and loveliness of Wexford  the young and the old  the maid

<p>" and matron  when Cromwell entered the town by treachery,
</p>
<p>" three hundred inoffensive women of all ages and classes were
</p>
<p>" collected round the Cross of Christ, erected in a part of the town
</p>
<p>" called the ' Bull Ring;' they prayed to Heaven for mercy, and I
</p>
<p>" hope they found it; they prayed to the English for humanity,
</p>
<p>" and Cromwell slaughtered them. I tell you this  three hundred
</p>
<p>" of the grace and beauty and virtue of Wexford were slaughtered
</p>
<p>" by the English ruffians  Sacred Heaven ! I am not at all ima-
</p>
<p>" ginative when I talk of the possibility of such occurrences anew."
</p>
<p>What is the meaning of introducing a story of that nature, which,
</p>
<p>if it ever existed, or if there be a word of truth in it, took place
</p>
<p>two hundred years ago ? For what purpose is that introduced?
</p>
<p>Is that, Gentlemen, ask yourselves, for the purpose of free discus-
</p>
<p>sion upon a political question, or is it for the purpose of exciting
</p>
<p>by those details, whether true or false, the animosity or hatred of
</p>
<p>the Irish against the English? " I am not at all imaginative,
</p>
<p>845
</p>
<p>" when I talk of this, but yet I assert, that there would be no
</p>
<p>" danger of the women now ; for the men of Ireland would die to
</p>
<p>" the last in their defence. [Here the whole company rose and
</p>
<p>" cheered for several minutes. J We were a paltry remnant then 
</p>
<p>" we are nine millions now."
</p>
<p>That is not the only place, or the only occasion, where the
</p>
<p>assembled multitudes were treated with stories of such horrors and
</p>
<p>such profanations committed by the English against the Irish.
</p>
<p>Amongst other very remarkable meetings which were held under
</p>
<p>the auspices of Mr. 0"Connell, and those who go with him, was a
</p>
<p>great meeting which was held at Tara, in the county of Meath, on
</p>
<p>the 15th of August last, a place of particular veneration. It is a
</p>
<p>spot religions saeer, and selected upon that account, and the his-
</p>
<p>tory connected with it, as the place for the enormous meeting.
</p>
<p>Captain Despard, who attended that meeting, a stipendiary Magis-
</p>
<p>trate, supposed the number of persons assembled there, to have been
</p>
<p>three hundred thousand. At the Association, Mr. O'Connell, and
</p>
<p>those in the interest of the Association, described it as infinitely
</p>
<p>greater, amounting, according to some, to a million persons ; accord-
</p>
<p>ing to others, and I believe Mr. O'Connell himself, to a million and
</p>
<p>a half. The people so assembled were addressed by Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>and others ; and, Gentlemen, there was a dinner, as there had been
</p>
<p>at other of the monster meetings, Epotaque fiumina Medo pran-
</p>
<p>dente, and the conviviality of the evening was enlivened by a speech
</p>
<p>of Mr. O'Connell's. " I am not standing on what are called,
</p>
<p>" foolishly, points of honour. If I could do good by imploring of
</p>
<p>" them in the abject position of placing myself on my bended
</p>
<p>" knees before my fellow-creature, I would cheerfully do so for the
</p>
<p>" sake of Ireland ; but while I have that disposition I have also the
</p>
<p>" high and haughty spirit of the leader of the Irish people." That
</p>
<p>is the position which he has assumed. " I feel that entreaty would
</p>
<p>" be condescension, but in the hearty spirit of brotherly conciliation
</p>
<p>" I meet them as Irishmen, and our object is to have Ireland for the
</p>
<p>" Irish. This day is a proof of how certain we are of success.

</p>
<p>" Within the last week I have addressed I am certain two millions
</p>
<p>" of Irish people. 1 thought in the glens of Wicklow, that the
</p>
<p>" assemblage which met my view was the most majestic I ever wit-
</p>
<p>" nessed." That was at Baltinglass. "And since then, in the
</p>
<p>" Queen's County, where I expected comparative paucity of num-
</p>
<p>" bers, and perhaps too a laxity of zeal, I was met hy a still
</p>
<p>" more majestic meeting, and the procession entirely covered
</p>
<p>" that curious natural production, extending for three and a half
</p>
<p>" miles of a winding road, and contained tens and hundreds of
</p>
<p>" thousands of enthusiastic people." That is the way in which
</p>
<p>" he describes these multitudes. From this I turn to the splendid
</p>
<p>" spectacle of to day. Thousands upon thousands were around
</p>
<p>" us, but where are they now?" This was at the dinner. They
</p>
<p>" are dissolved like the snow before the returning of the south
</p>
<p>" wind and the genial sun. They are gone home in peace, in quiet,
</p>
<p>" and in tranquillity. But if I were to call them together again to-
</p>
<p>846
</p>
<p>" morrow, and to tell them that the Saxons were at their doors;
</p>
<p>" that the scenes that had been so often repeated from the day when
</p>
<p>" the vile Cromwell deliberately massacred three hundred women
</p>
<p>" grouped around the Cross of the Redeemer in the town of Wex-
</p>
<p>" ford ; from that day when the barbarian Saxon delighted his
</p>
<p>" assassin soldiers by the slow process of individual murder, until
</p>
<p>" the three hundred females were, one after the other, stabbed and
</p>
<p>" massacred." Gentlemen of the Jury, there is the same horrible
</p>
<p>story of the most astonishing barbarity and cruelty, repeated again,
</p>
<p>after a considerable interval of time, in another place, to another
</p>
<p>assembly ; and thousands and hundreds of thousands are again ex-
</p>
<p>cited by the same detail of British cruelty, British barbarity, com-
</p>
<p>mitted two hundred years ago, with an intimation that such scenes
</p>
<p>might occur again. " From that day, when the barbarian Saxon
</p>
<p>" delighted his assassin soldiers by the slow process of individual
</p>
<p>" murder, until the three hundred females were, one after the other,
</p>
<p>" stabbed and massacred. Even Tara Hill is stained with modern
</p>
<p>" blood, and the bones are not mouldered yet of the individuals
</p>
<p>" who were massacred in hundreds upon it." What that alludes to
</p>
<p>I cannot tell. " If such another force were brought from England
</p>
<p>" now, if it were announced to the people that some paltry Orange-
</p>
<p>" men were armed, and that foreign soldiers were brought over to
</p>
<p>" butcher, to slaughter, to dishonour; oh ! tell the people that, and
</p>
<p>" see whether they have melted away like the snow. [Hear, hear,
</p>
<p>" and tremendous cheers]." Gentlemen of the Jury, it appears to
</p>
<p>have been his constant practice at most, if not all of those meetings,
</p>
<p>to invite the assembled people to obey his call, to be ready and
</p>
<p>assemble again whenever he might think proper to call for them ;
</p>
<p>and the Tara meeting is one of the occasions in which he intimated
</p>
<p>to the assembled people, that he did not think they would be found
</p>
<p>to have melted away like snow ; if an English army came again to
</p>
<p>this country, they would collect again. Is this threat and intimida-
</p>
<p>tion, or is it free discission? Is it seeking to procure a change in
</p>
<p>the law and constitution by intimidation, and the show of physical

</p>
<p>force, or is it free and fair discussion, such as might properly be
</p>
<p>adopted and resorted to by all or any persons who have political
</p>
<p>rights to advance ? It is for you to consider what are the meaning
</p>
<p>and object of those speeches ? What is the meaning of those dis-
</p>
<p>plays, those statements of physical force : " nine millions of people
</p>
<p>joined with us '?" That is what he signifies in express terms ; what
</p>
<p>is the meaning of it ? It is for you to say, Gentlemen of the Jury,
</p>
<p>whether it is an answer to that portion of the charge or statement,
</p>
<p>that no breach of the peace has been committed at any one of those
</p>
<p>meetings. It is quite true, and Mr. O'Connell in his address to
</p>
<p>you, took great credit to himself for there not having been even an
</p>
<p>accident, such was the organization and discipline of this immense
</p>
<p>body of persons. But, however, Gentlemen, I do not wish to anti-
</p>
<p>pate that ; I will mention it again when I come to another part of
</p>
<p>the case.
</p>
<p>I have now detailed to you the facts of a similar nature, detailed
</p>
<p>847
</p>
<p>and stated by Mr. O'Connell on the occasion of three several
</p>
<p>monster meetings. I now go to another. Amongst other places to
</p>
<p>which he went to hold a monster meeting, or to assist in it, was
</p>
<p>Cliiden, in Connemara ; a meeting which took place on the 17th of
</p>
<p>September. There were many meetings on or about the same time,
</p>
<p>but I do not think it necessary to go through them, and I pass
</p>
<p>over, without comment, the meetings at Donnybrook and Loughrea.
</p>
<p>The notes of the Clifden meeting were supplied by Mr. Ross, who
</p>
<p>attended there on behalf of the Crown, and took what he swears
</p>
<p>to be an accurate note of what occurred. There was, as usual, a
</p>
<p>great assemblage. There was a numerous body of persons on
</p>
<p>horseback, who, you will find, are denominated by Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>as "mounted cavalry," of which, at the time, Mr. Steele, the
</p>
<p>traverser, appears to have taken the command, for the purpose of
</p>
<p>forming them into regular order. There were speeches made in
</p>
<p>the morning. There was a dinner, at which Dr. Gray attended,
</p>
<p>and made a speech ; it was not a very long one, but it contained,
</p>
<p>amongst others, this statement. " When I go back to Dublin I
</p>
<p>" shall tell them, that the people of Clifden are determined to part
</p>
<p>" with life, before they will desert the cause of Repeal ; that they
</p>
<p>" respect their country and themselves, and will stand boldly by
</p>
<p>" their colours. Let no tyrannical landlords or agents cause you
</p>
<p>" to flinch. Where is the man who dare come forward and say he
</p>
<p>" will eject you because you are Repealers ? Oh! you are too strong
</p>
<p>" for that now. Rely on your friend, and be not by any artifice or
</p>
<p>" trick drawn from the position you have taken. Let peace and
</p>
<p>" order be your motto, and you will finally triumph." Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell also made a speech. And observe, Gentlemen, although it is
</p>
<p>somewhat prolix and tedious, the particulars of this speech. It has
</p>
<p>a bearing upon many parts of this alleged conspiracy ; if I do not
</p>
<p>mistake, it has a bearing on every part of it, but you will have to
</p>
<p>consider it all for the purposes of your verdict. " This proves to
</p>
<p>" demonstration [says Mr. O'Connell], that Ireland can be, as
</p>
<p>" it shall be, a nation. I may be asked why not then rush to the

</p>
<p>" conclusion at once, that having physical power surrounding me
</p>
<p>" during the last six months infinitely greater that any conqueror
</p>
<p>" ever had,  the master of thirty legions had not more physical
</p>
<p>" power at his command than I have had during the last five or six
</p>
<p>" months. It may be asked why do I not use it ? My reply is 
</p>
<p>'* yes, I will use it, but not abuse it. Its abuse would be in illegal
</p>
<p>" and criminal exertion ; its use in mild, legal, and moral combina-
</p>
<p>" tion. I have given England and Europe a proof of how much
</p>
<p>" physical power may be concentrated with perfect safety to life
</p>
<p>" and property, and even without tendency to insult and injury. I
</p>
<p>" have gained that step, and I defy the Rritish Ministry to take it
</p>
<p>" from me. I have demonstrated that I have more men, more
</p>
<p>" men of a fighting age, why should I not use that word, ready to
</p>
<p>" stand by their country, than ever evinced that determination be-
</p>
<p>" fore." Has that a bearing, Gentlemen, on the question whether
</p>
<p>these speeches were made to these assembled multitudes for the
</p>
<p>848
</p>
<p>purpose of intimidation, for the purpose of overawing the Legisla-
</p>
<p>ture, for the purpose of letting the ministers hear of, not his argu-
</p>
<p>ments, his peaceable arguments on behalf of free discussion, but
</p>
<p>his statements of the power he held in his hands ? "I say to
</p>
<p>" England, we will use no violence, we will make no attack, we will
</p>
<p>" reserve our force for defence, but attack us if you dare. [Cheers].
</p>
<p>" What is the answer ? We do not intend to attack you, and you
</p>
<p>" need not set us at defiance. My reply is the schoolboy's, ' thank
</p>
<p>" you for nothing, says the gallipot.' ' But then,' they say, 'how
</p>
<p>" can you carry Repeal? If you take a single additional step, we
</p>
<p>" will go to law with you.' My answer is, that I am an old lawyer,
</p>
<p>" and the proverb says, ' you can't catch old birds with chaff,' and
</p>
<p>" they are not able to beat an old lawyer with chaff at all events. I
</p>
<p>" set your chaff at defiance, and will take the next step in spite of
</p>
<p>" you." Here then he turns to another subject, part also of the
</p>
<p>alleged conspiracy. " We are appointing men to act as Arbitrators
</p>
<p>" in the room of magistrates who were struck off, and those who
</p>
<p>" are left in the commission, who are infinitely worse. Last year
</p>
<p>" Goulburn took off the duty on arbitrations, as if he had actually
</p>
<p>" seen what was coming. I have them there, and do they think
</p>
<p>" that they will catch an old bird with chaff? You will see in the
</p>
<p>" newspapers a report of the first Court of Arbitration which will
</p>
<p>" sit on Friday next, Dr. Gray in the chair." Was there concert
</p>
<p>between them ? " It will sit every Friday afterwards." How
</p>
<p>did he know that except by previous concert and arrangement ?
</p>
<p>" They will spread through the country. We have had a num-
</p>
<p>" ber of applications for the establishment of Courts," not of arbi-
</p>
<p>trations, " in various parts of Ireland; and I am convinced that it
</p>
<p>" will work well. Disputes, which now fester and rankle in a
</p>
<p>" village, will be settled amicably. It will spread further. I will
</p>
<p>" apply the principle to a higher class of cases. We will appoint
</p>
<p>" Arbitrators for everything the people may choose." We will ap-
</p>
<p>point Arbitrators. " And 1 trust before I am twelve months older
</p>
<p>" to take half the business out of the superior Courts. This is

</p>
<p>" laying the basis of a judicial system." What is the law upon the
</p>
<p>subject? Whoever interferes with the Queen's prerogative, judi-
</p>
<p>cial or otherwise, is guilty of an high misdemeanor. " I defy all
</p>
<p>the Crown lawyers to find a flaw in the plan." It is not necessary
</p>
<p>for me to discuss the law with Mr. O'Connell ; but that is not the
</p>
<p>way I put the law to you. Now here is a further proof of what he
</p>
<p>and his multitudes are doing, independent of the Crown, in-
</p>
<p>dependent of the Legislature. " I have made arrangements to
</p>
<p>" ascertain what parts of Ireland ought to return members to
</p>
<p>" the Irish Parliament; I am getting returns of notices, and when-
</p>
<p>*' ever the Queen's writs may issue, it will only be necessary to
</p>
<p>" put a bit of wax at the end of a piece of parchment and we shall
</p>
<p>" have a Parliament at once. I want to know how they will catch
</p>
<p>" me at that ?" He and the Queen, I suppose, were acting in con-
</p>
<p>cert together for the purpose of violating her Coronation Oath. " I
</p>
<p>" will play the game, until I checkmate them. It may be necessary
</p>
<p>849
</p>
<p>" for me to go slowly, and to ask the people of Ireland to continue
</p>
<p>" their confidence in me whilst I go slowly. It is better to be slow
</p>
<p>" and sure, than fast and uncertain. I will not go a bit faster
</p>
<p>" for the taunts of enemies or the sneers of pretended friends."
</p>
<p>Here is another plan. " We are to have an Association which is
</p>
<p>" to meet by chance in Dublin"  by chance  " I hope before this
</p>
<p>" year closes, but at all events I am sure early in the next, three
</p>
<p>" hundred gentlemen will find themselves together in Dublin by
</p>
<p>" one accident or another." How this was to be done, I cannot
</p>
<p>say, except by the temporary loan of the lamp of Aladdin. Now
</p>
<p>here is another part of this meeting for full, and free, and fair dis-
</p>
<p>cussion. " Without going into the Convention Act, or any other
</p>
<p>" Act, I say, at the time I have stated, we shall have three hundred
</p>
<p>" gentlemen assembled, ready to enter into immediate negotiation
</p>
<p>" with the British Minister, to show him the state of Ireland, to
</p>
<p>" show him our further resources, to show him how we could
</p>
<p>" paralyse the entire State, and that it would be done by nothing but
</p>
<p>" sowing more potatoes and leaving the harvest to rot on the field,
</p>
<p>" except the poor man's part, the potatoes, to show him that we
</p>
<p>" have physical power, and that, if assailed, we will use it. I have
</p>
<p>" more projects in my mind, but I will not speak of them now, by
</p>
<p>" which I can checkmate the Government tranquilly and quietly.
</p>
<p>" It is avowed that proud England dare not assume an attitude of
</p>
<p>" menace towards any state in the world, however insignificant.
</p>
<p>" [Cheers]. The English Government can no longer threaten.
</p>
<p>" Alas ! it cannot exert itself in necessary defence. It is weak, be-
</p>
<p>" cause it has withered the strong arm of Irish affection. They
</p>
<p>" have not conciliated Ireland, because they offered nothing as are-
</p>
<p>" medy for our grievances but a miserable paltry compromise,
</p>
<p>" giving what children call the smallest half, and what have we re-
</p>
<p>" plied? We have said that there shall be no compromise. Repeal,
</p>
<p>" nothing but Repeal. [Cheers.] For the present year my monster
</p>
<p>" meetings are nearly over. There will not be above seven or
</p>
<p>" eight more of them ; but before I have done with them, the

</p>
<p>" demonstration of moral combination, and of the mighty giant
</p>
<p>" power of the people of Ireland, will be complete. Their disci-
</p>
<p>" pline will be complete. Why, you saw how the cavalry fell
</p>
<p>" in and took their station, five by five, at the word of command
</p>
<p>" of Tom Steele." That is at that meeting at Clifden. " No
</p>
<p>" aide-de-camp of the Lord Lieutenant was ever obeyed so cheer-
</p>
<p>" fully as he was. The people of Ireland are moral, religious, and
</p>
<p>" disciplined. Their universal voice is shouting around me. I
</p>
<p>" have with me nine-tenths of the nation, and that portion which
</p>
<p>" is opposed to me is in a state of delusion from which they will
</p>
<p>" soon be roused. I believe I shall have nine-tenths of Ulster
</p>
<p>" with me. I know I have three-fourths already. How delighted
</p>
<p>" I am with the additional testimony Connemara has afforded
</p>
<p>" me of the confidence of the people." This is the language
</p>
<p>used by those gentlemen at that assembled meeting at Conne-
</p>
<p>mara. It is for you to say, Gentlemen, is that the language of
</p>
<p>5Q
</p>
<p>850
</p>
<p>calm and reasonable discussion ? Or is it the show of defiance
</p>
<p>and boldness of a man exulting in " the giant power of the Irish
</p>
<p>people," who he said were under his control, at his beck ? And if
</p>
<p>an individual is thus to proclaim the power he has over those
</p>
<p>countless multitudes, in order that it may be exhibited to the
</p>
<p>English Ministry, as he says himself, is it to intimidate, or is it to
</p>
<p>discuss fairly a particular question ?
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, there is another meeting, at Mullaghmast, at which
</p>
<p>I have not yet quite arrived ; and 1 wish to call your attention, as
</p>
<p>we pass along, to the evidence given by Mr. Jackson, respecting the
</p>
<p>meeting of the Association on the 29th of August, 1843. And you
</p>
<p>will see (and you are to judge of all these things) whether this be
</p>
<p>consistent with, and in conlinuation of, the same sort of threat
</p>
<p>and intimidation that had taken place before. Mr. Jackson gives
</p>
<p>this evidence of what was stated by Mr. O'Connell at the Association
</p>
<p>on the 29th of August. " And now he had again his bill of indict-
</p>
<p>" ment against that miscreant Ministry, where the people of Ireland
</p>
<p>" were accused of being disaffected. He admitted they were disaf-
</p>
<p>" fected, and the country was now dissatisfied, and if the Union
</p>
<p>" were not dissolved, he much feared that a sanguinary war would
</p>
<p>" hereafter lead to perpetual separation." Is that a threat ? or is it
</p>
<p>fair discussion? So far there is no difference, or imputation on the
</p>
<p>correctness of Mr. Jackson. Mr. O'Connell says that Mr. Jackson
</p>
<p>had made a mistake of a word in the next sentence, and put in one
</p>
<p>word for another. I therefore will not read it, because it is better
</p>
<p>that nothing of a questionable nature should go before you in the
</p>
<p>way of evidence, nothing disputed.
</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen, I will come to another very important meeting,
</p>
<p>and with that I mean to close what I have to say on the subject of
</p>
<p>these meetings. There was a great meeting at Mullaghmast, which
</p>
<p>took place on the 1st of October last. Gentlemen, this meeting look
</p>
<p>place some time after the delivery of the Queen's Speech, on the close
</p>
<p>of Parliament. That speech is not in evidence before you, further
</p>
<p>than this, that the fact of it is adverted to by the traversers in some of

</p>
<p>their speeches, but further than that you are not to take into your
</p>
<p>consideration what were the words delivered by Her Majesty on that
</p>
<p>occasion. Her Majesty's Speech, proroguing Parliament, was deli-
</p>
<p>vered, I believe, on the 24th of August. Some short time after that
</p>
<p>it was determined by the Association that another great monster
</p>
<p>meeting should be holden in the county of Kildare, at a place called
</p>
<p>Mullaghmast. This meeting was most particularly and expressly got
</p>
<p>up under the immediate direction of Mr. O'Connell and the Associa-
</p>
<p>tion. The printer for the Association, Mr. Browne, has been pro-
</p>
<p>duced, and examined as a witness before you ; and he has deposed,
</p>
<p>amongst other things, that at his printing office, under the immediate
</p>
<p>direction of Mr. Ray, the Secretary for the Association, he (Mr.
</p>
<p>Browne) printed a number, amounting to somewhere about two
</p>
<p>thousand, of what is called the yellow placard, calling upon the peo-
</p>
<p>ple of the province of Leinster to attend that meeting. Here is a
</p>
<p>copy of the yellow placard, and nobody can doubt, who has heard
</p>
<p>851
</p>
<p>the evidence in this case, but that this meeting at Mullaghmast was
</p>
<p>one of a most deliberate character. " Leinster for Repeal. Men of
</p>
<p>Leinster to Mullaghmast. The province will declare for Repeal."
</p>
<p>They will declare for it; not they will petition for it. " They will
</p>
<p>u declare for Repeal on the Rath of Mullaghmast, on Sunday, the
</p>
<p>"1st of October ; the Corporations of the Province will attend;
</p>
<p>" after the meeting the Liberator will be entertained at a banquet
</p>
<p>" on the Rath. The line of procession will go through Kilcullen,
</p>
<p>" Colvertstown, and the long avenue to Mullaghmast. The bands
</p>
<p>" and horsemen to muster at Kilcullen." There is something of
</p>
<p>military diction in that. " Once more, Men of Leinster, remember
</p>
<p>*' Mullaghmast. Dated 21st September, 1843. Browne, printer, 36,
</p>
<p>" Nassau-street." That is not equivocal. There did assemble there
</p>
<p>thousands upon thousands, equal in point of numbers to the vast
</p>
<p>ocean of persons that assembled in and upon the Hill of Tara  over-
</p>
<p>whelming multitudes. They came there, as the placard announces,
</p>
<p>attended by bands, and the cavalry mustered, I presume, at the
</p>
<p>place appointed. They began to assemble at an early hour in the
</p>
<p>morning, because millions or thousands upon thousands cannot be
</p>
<p>brought together in a moment ; and it took a long time to bring to-
</p>
<p>gether such an extraordinary demonstration of physical force. Re-
</p>
<p>collect the character of those forces given by Mr. O'Connell at the
</p>
<p>Clifden meeting, a few weeks before. They came attended by bands
</p>
<p>and banners, a great number of which had inscriptions upon them.
</p>
<p>Early in the morning there was circulated, at Mullaghmast, a particular
</p>
<p>publication having a direct reference to the subject, for it called upon
</p>
<p>the people to remember Mullaghmast. Now you will observe, Gentle-
</p>
<p>men of the Jury, that this paper is proved to have been circulated to the
</p>
<p>amount of thousands, at least two thousand, about the Rath, or where-
</p>
<p>ever it was the meeting was assembled. It is in proof that the multiudes
</p>
<p>who came from Dublin, many of them, hundreds of them, came with
</p>
<p>wands, and Repeal tickets stuck in their hats, with a designation
</p>
<p>marked, "O'ConneU's Police.' 1 '' And you have heard a great deal of the
</p>
<p>power and efficacy of that police in the preservation of peace and

</p>
<p>good order ; that is to say, that peace which consists in the absence
</p>
<p>of riot or disturbance ; but how far it consists in the absence of what
</p>
<p>is criminal is another question. These papers, giving a description
</p>
<p>of Mullaghmast, were in circulation to the number of at least two
</p>
<p>thousand. However, it is said that that paper was not printed by Mr.
</p>
<p>Browne, the printerof the Association, and therefore it was not to be
</p>
<p>taken as one of the badges circulated for the purpose of the meeting.
</p>
<p>How did it happen that in no one instance did those celebrated
</p>
<p>police of Mr. O'Connell's attempt to stop the vending or circulation
</p>
<p>of it ? A circulation of two thousand copies could not have taken
</p>
<p>place without the knowledge of this police. Was there a hand lifted
</p>
<p>up to prevent the distribution of this infamous publication ? Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, let us see whether there is anything in this statement so very
</p>
<p>inconsistent with the scenes of cruelty and bloodshed that had been
</p>
<p>described by Mr. O'Connell himself at Tara, at Mallow, and else-
</p>
<p>where. And afterwards let us see whether there be any inconsis-
</p>
<p>852
</p>
<p>tency in the statements made in it, and those made in the speeches
</p>
<p>delivered at Mullaghmast by Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Barrett, and others
</p>
<p>of the traversers. [His Lordship having read the document which
</p>
<p>has been before set out, ante, p. 278, then proceeded.] That is the
</p>
<p>conciliatory, argumentative, peaceable, and tranquil way in which the
</p>
<p>people assembling at this meeting were prepared for it. I say no at-
</p>
<p>tempt was made by any one of Mr. O'Connell's police to prevent the
</p>
<p>circulation of that paper. Now, Gentlemen, so far were they from
</p>
<p>putting down, or attempting to put down, the circulation of that
</p>
<p>story, and that horrible statement, you will find that in the speeches
</p>
<p>made by Mr. O'Connell, one in the morning to the assembled mul-
</p>
<p>titudes, and the other at the dinner or banquet, the very same story,
</p>
<p>not exactly perhaps in the same words, but in substance and in spirit
</p>
<p>altogether the same, was repeated and delivered by him. What object
</p>
<p>had he in that ? What object had they who attended him on that occa-
</p>
<p>sion, and took part in his deliberations, some of whom repeated, in lan-
</p>
<p>guage of their own, the same story and the same sentiments ? The
</p>
<p>history of what took place at Mullaghmast is given by an unimpeached
</p>
<p>witness, Mr. Bond Hughes. Inscribed on the banners were the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing : The man who commits a crime gives strength to the enemy.
</p>
<p>That is a favourite motto. Ireland must be a Nation. Repeal, jl
</p>
<p>country of nine millions of inhabitants is too great to be dragged at
</p>
<p>the tail of any nation. Is that argument, or is it threat ? Men, with
</p>
<p>inscriptions on white paper round their hats with O' Connell's Police,
</p>
<p>did duty in keeping order on and about the platform. Then he speaks
</p>
<p>of several other things which I need not state. Mr. O'Connell, upon
</p>
<p>the platform, says this : " I accept with the greatest alacrity the
</p>
<p>" high honour you have done me in calling me to the chair at this
</p>
<p>" majestic meeting. I feel more honoured than ever I did in my life,
</p>
<p>" with a single exception, and that related to an equally, if possible,
</p>
<p>" majestic meeting at Tara ; but I must say, that if a comparison
</p>
<p>" were to be instituted between them, it would take a more dis-
</p>
<p>" criminating eye than mine to discover any difference between
</p>
<p>" them. There are the same incalculable numbers, there is the

</p>
<p>" same firmness, there is the same determination, the same ex-
</p>
<p>" hibition of love to old Ireland, and the same resolution not to
</p>
<p>" violate the peace, not to be guilty of the slightest outrage, not
</p>
<p>" to give the enemy power by committing a crime, but peaceably
</p>
<p>" and manfully to stand together in the open day, to protest
</p>
<p>" before man, and in the presence of God, against the iniquity
</p>
<p>" of continuing the Union." [Loud cheers.] "At Tara I pro-
</p>
<p>" tested against the Union, to-day I repeat the protest at Mullagh-
</p>
<p>" mast ; I declare solemnly my thorough conviction, as a constitu-
</p>
<p>" tional lawyer, that the Union is totally void in point of principle
</p>
<p>" and constitutional force. I tell you that no portion of the empire
</p>
<p>" has the power of trampling on the rights and liberties of the Irish
</p>
<p>" people. The Irish Parliament was instituted to make laws, and not
</p>
<p>" Legislatures ; it was instituted under the Constitution, and not to
</p>
<p>" annihilate it. Their delegation from the people was confined
</p>
<p>" within the limits of the constitution, and the moment Parliament
</p>
<p>853
</p>
<p>" went beyond and destroyed the Constitution, that instant it anni-
</p>
<p>" hilated its own powers, but it could not annihilate that immortal
</p>
<p>" spirit which belonged, as a righful inheritance, to the people of
</p>
<p>" Ireland. Take it from me, that the Union is void. I admit that
</p>
<p>" it has the force of law, because it is supported by the policeman's
</p>
<p><( truncheon, the soldier's bayonet, and the horseman's sword ; be-
</p>
<p>" cause it is supported bv the courts of law, and those who have
</p>
<p>" power to adjudicate ; but I say solemnly, it is not supported by
</p>
<p>" constitutional rights. The Union, therefore, in my thorough con-
</p>
<p>" viction, is totally void." That is Mr. O'Connell's assertion, in
</p>
<p>the presence of the assembled thousands  " I admit that it has
</p>
<p>" the force of law, because it is supported by the policeman's trun-
</p>
<p>" cheon, the soldier's bayonet, and the horseman's sword; because it
</p>
<p>*' is supported by the Courts of law, and those who have power to
</p>
<p>"adjudicate." Why does he not submit to it, then? " But I
</p>
<p>" say solemnly, it is not supported by constitutional rights. The
</p>
<p>" Union, therefore, in my thorough conviction, is totally void, and I
</p>
<p>" will avail myself of this opportunity to announce to several hun-
</p>
<p>" dred thousands of my fellow-subjects, that that unconstitutional
</p>
<p>" law, the Union, is not fated to last long, its hour is approaching.
</p>
<p>" America offered us her sympathy and support, we refused the sup-
</p>
<p>" port, but we accepted the sympathy of the Americans; we stood
</p>
<p>" upon the firm ground of the right of every human being to liberty,
</p>
<p>" and I, in the name of the Irish nation, declare that no support ob-
</p>
<p>" tained from America shall be purchased by the price of our aban-
</p>
<p>" doning principle for one moment ; and our principle is, that every
</p>
<p>" human being is entitled to freedom. I therefore denounced it at
</p>
<p>" the Association, and in this enormous multitude I again denounce
</p>
<p>" the slavery of the negro in America; I pronounce it an injustice
</p>
<p>" against man, and a sin in its operation against the Eternal God ;
</p>
<p>" and it would be of little importance that I should make that an-
</p>
<p>" nouncement and protest, if I were not backed by the Irish people;
</p>
<p>" but I am backed by them. What I say upon this subject, you one
</p>
<p>" and all join me in. [Immense cries of ' We do, we do !'J Let

<p>" that cry go to America. Yes, my friends, I want nothing but Ire-
</p>
<p>* land for the Irish ; I think the Irish competent to obtain their own
</p>
<p>" country for themselves. I like to have the sympathy of every
</p>
<p>" good man every where, but I want not the armed support of phy-
</p>
<p>" sical strength from any country." Then he states that the repub-
</p>
<p>" lican party in France offered him assistance, and his rejection of it.
</p>
<p>" I have physical force enough about me to-day to achieve anything;
</p>
<p>" but you know full well that is not my plan. I won't risk one of
</p>
<p>" you. I could not afford to lose one of you. I will protect you all ;
</p>
<p>" and I will obtain for you all the Repeal of the Union. There is
</p>
<p>" not a man of you there, if we were attacked unjustly, illegally attack-
</p>
<p>" ed, who would not be ready to stand in the open field by my side.
</p>
<p>" Let every man who concurs in that sentiment, lift up his hand."
</p>
<p>[An immense number were displayed.] "The assertion of that sen-
</p>
<p>" timent is our sure protection; for nobody will attack us, and we
</p>
<p>" will attack nobody. Indeed it will be the height of absurdity in
</p>
<p>854
</p>
<p>" us (o think of making an attack, when we can play the game peace-
</p>
<p>" ably and quietly. There is not a man in his senses in Europe
</p>
<p>" or America, that does not admit that the Repeal of the Union
</p>
<p>" is now inevitable. The English newspapers taunted us, and their
</p>
<p>'-' writers, who first laughed us to scorn, now admit that it is im-
</p>
<p>" possible to resist the application for Repeal." [Cries of ' more
</p>
<p>power to you.'] That is the answer of the people. " Oh ! we
</p>
<p>" have power enough, and we know how to use it. Why, it is
</p>
<p>" only this week that one of the leading London newspapers,
</p>
<p>" called the Morning Herald, who had a Reporter at the Lis-
</p>
<p>" more meeting, published an account of that great and mighty
</p>
<p>u meeting, and in that account the writer expressly says, that it
</p>
<p>" will be impossible to refuse so peaceable, so determined, and so
</p>
<p>" unanimous a people, as the people of Ireland, the restoration of
</p>
<p>" their domestic legislation. For my own part I would have thought
</p>
<p>" it totally unnecessary to call together so large a meeting as this,
</p>
<p>" but for a trick played by Wellington and Peel, and Graham and
</p>
<p>" Stanley, and the rest of that paltry Administration, by whose go-
</p>
<p>" vernment this country is disgraced. I do not suppose that so
</p>
<p>" worthless an Administration was ever got together." He then
</p>
<p>goes into abuse of several of the Ministers, which I shall not repeat.
</p>
<p>" I was angry at first, but I am glad of it ; they"  that is the Minis-
</p>
<p>ters  "have put a speech, abusing the Irish, into the Queen's mouth;
</p>
<p>" abusing the Irish nobility, accusing us of disaffection. Oh ! they
</p>
<p>" lie, it is their speech ; there is no disaffection in Ireland ; we were
</p>
<p>" loyal to the House of Brunswick when they were our enemies; we
</p>
<p>" were loyal to George the Third when he betrayed us ; we were loyal
</p>
<p>" to George the Fourth when he blubbered and cried because we
</p>
<p>" forced him to emancipate us ; we were loyal to old Billy, though
</p>
<p>" his Ministers put into his mouth a base, bloody, and intolerant
</p>
<p>" speech against Ireland ; and we are loyal to the Queen, notwith-
</p>
<p>*' standing anything they may say ; but their speech it is, and I pro-
</p>
<p>" nounce it a lie ; there is no disaffection in Ireland ; but there is
</p>
<p>" this, a full determination to obtain justice and liberty." Those

</p>
<p>are very high sounding words. " I am obliged to them for that
</p>
<p>" speech, because it gives me, among other things, the pleasure of
</p>
<p>" addressing such an assembly to-day. I thought the monster meet-
</p>
<p>" ings had demonstrated the opinion of Ireland." Whatever that
</p>
<p>speech was, we have it not before us in evidence, but it is plain from
</p>
<p>the context, that it was a speech disapproving of the steps that were
</p>
<p>then being taken, and had been taken, by the Repealers of this
</p>
<p>country. Because it was presumed that that speech had been de-
</p>
<p>livered by the Queen, or composed by the Ministers, Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>states he called together this enormous meeting at Mullaghmast.
</p>
<p>" I was convinced that their unanimous determination to obtain
</p>
<p>" liberty was sufficiently signified by the many meetings that already
</p>
<p>" took place ; but when the Queen's Ministers' speech came out, I
</p>
<p>" saw it was necessary to do something more ; accordingly I called a
</p>
<p>"meeting at Loughrea, a monster meeting; we called another
</p>
<p>" meeting at Clifden, a monster meeting ; we called another meet-
</p>
<p>855
</p>
<p>" ing at Lismore, a monster meeting ; and here we are now upon
</p>
<p>" the Rath of Mullaghmast. At Mullaghmast, I chose it for an
</p>
<p>** obvious reason." And this is the deliberate reason assigned
</p>
<p>by him for his preference : " We are upon the precise spot in
</p>
<p>" which English treachery, aye, and false Irish treachery too, con-
</p>
<p>" summated a massacre unequalled in the crimes of the history of the
</p>
<p>" world, until the massacre of the Mamelukes by Mehemet Ali. It
</p>
<p>" was necessary to have Turks to commit a crime in order to be equal
</p>
<p>" to the crime of the English ; no other people but Turks were wick-
</p>
<p>" ed enough except the English. But do not think it was a question
</p>
<p>" at Mullaghmast between the Catholics and the Protestants, it was
</p>
<p>" no such thing ; the murdered people were Catholics to be sure, but
</p>
<p>" there were a great number of the murderers also Catholics ; because
</p>
<p>" there were traitors then to Ireland, and there are some Catholics of
</p>
<p>" the same kind existing now ; but we have now this advantage, we
</p>
<p>" have many honest Protestants joining us, many of them joining us
</p>
<p>" in heart and in hand, going for old Ireland and liberty. I thought
</p>
<p>" this a fit and becoming spot to celebrate our unanimity in declaring
</p>
<p>" in open day, our determination not to be misled by any treachery."
</p>
<p>Is that, or is that not, in unison with the printed paper circulated
</p>
<p>over the Rath of Mullaghmast ? " Oh ! my friends, I will keep you
</p>
<p>" clear of all treachery, there shall be no bargain, no compromise 
</p>
<p>" nothing but the Repeal and a Parliament of our own. You will
</p>
<p>" never, by my advice, confide in any false hopes they hold out, you
</p>
<p>" will confide in nothing until you hear me say I am satisfied ; and I
</p>
<p>" will tell you where I shall say that  near the statue of King William
</p>
<p>" in College-green. No, we came here to express our determination
</p>
<p>" to die to a man, if necessary ; but we came to take the advice of
</p>
<p>" each other; and above all, you came here to take my advice. I
</p>
<p>" have the game in my hand ; I have the triumph secure ; I have the
</p>
<p>u Repeal certain, if you obey my advice. I will go slow. You must
</p>
<p>" allow me to do it ; but I will go sure. No man shall be fined, no
</p>
<p>" man shall be imprisoned, no man shall be prosecuted, who takes my
</p>
<p>" advice. I have led you thus far in safety; I have swelled the mul-

</p>
<p>*' titude of Repealers, till they are identified with the entire popula-
</p>
<p>" tion of the soil, or nearly so." Is that, or is it not, a display and a
</p>
<p>boast of physical force." '' I have seven-eighths of the population of
</p>
<p>" Ireland enrolling themselves as associates. [Cries of ' more power
</p>
<p>" to you']. I do not want more power, I have power enough. All I
</p>
<p>" ask of you is, to allow me to use it. I will go on quietly and slowly."
</p>
<p>Then he turns to another subject : " I am arranging the plan of a
</p>
<p>" new Irish House of Commons. It is a theory; but it is a theory that
</p>
<p>" may be realized in three weeks." How was that to be accomplish-
</p>
<p>ed ? What machinery was to be resorted to to bring about the estab-
</p>
<p>lishment of anew House of Commons for Ireland in three weeks? Was
</p>
<p>that to be done by physical force or was it to be done otherwise ? "The
</p>
<p>' Arbitrators are beginning to sit ; the people are submitting their dif-
</p>
<p>" ferences to men chosen by themselves. You will see by the news-
</p>
<p>" papers, that Dr. Gray and my son, and other gentlemen, held a
</p>
<p>" petty session of their own. It cost the people nothing. We will
</p>
<p>856
</p>
<p>" have chosen men of our own, in the room of magistrates whom they
</p>
<p>" have unjustly deprived." That is the reason that he gives for the es-
</p>
<p>tablishment of Arbitration Courts ; not with any view of preventing
</p>
<p>the practice of administering oaths, not with any view of assimilating
</p>
<p>themselves to the peaceable practice of the Quakers ; not with any
</p>
<p>view to assimilate themselves to the established practice of the Ouzel
</p>
<p>Galley in Dublin, which acts under process derived from the superior
</p>
<p>Courts: but the object was to put into these Arbitration Courts the
</p>
<p>magistrates who were dismissed by the Government forattending Repeal
</p>
<p>meetings. " I shall go on with this plan.'' Now at Connemara he
</p>
<p>said, that " in laying this plan for the establishment of Arbitration
</p>
<p>" Courts, I am laying the foundation of a new judicial system for
</p>
<p>" Courts of Justice. I shall go on with that plan until I have all dis-
</p>
<p>" putes decided by judges appointed by the people themselves. I
</p>
<p>" wish to live long enough to see justice realized in Ireland, and II-
</p>
<p>** berty proclaimed throughout the land." Is that, or is it not, in
</p>
<p>other words, saying that justice is not administered by the Courts of
</p>
<p>Law now in Ireland ? Is it, or is it not, a declaration made for the
</p>
<p>purpose of bringing into disrepute the Courts of Law existing in Ire-
</p>
<p>land and the administration of justice in them ? " It will take me" 
</p>
<p>take me  " some time to arrange the state of the new Irish House of
</p>
<p>" Commons  that plan which will be submitted one day to Her Ma-
</p>
<p>" jesty, when she has got rid of the present miserable and paltry Ad-
</p>
<p>" ministration, and has an Administration that I can support, consti-
</p>
<p>" tuted of friends of Ireland : we will have a Parliament ; but I must
</p>
<p>"finish that part of the job before I go further, and one of my rea-
</p>
<p>" sons for calling you together was, to proclaim throughout Ireland
</p>
<p>" that I want to arrange that before I go a step further. Let the

<p>" English have England, let the Scotch have Scotland, but we must
</p>
<p>" have Ireland for the Irish. I will not be content until I see not a
</p>
<p> single man in any office, from the lowest constable to the Lord
</p>
<p>" Chancellor, but Irishmen. This is our land and we must have it.
</p>
<p>" We will be obedient to the Queen, joined to England by the golden
</p>
<p>" link of the Crown, but we must have our own Parliament, our own

<p>" Bench, our own magistrates, and we will make some of the shoneens
</p>
<p>" now upon it leave it." What he means by that word I do not
</p>
<p>know. "In 1798 there were some brave men at the head of the
</p>
<p>" people at large; there were some valiant men, but there were many
</p>
<p>* traitors who left the people exposed (o the swordsof the enemy. On
</p>
<p>" the Curragh of Kildare you confided your military power to your
</p>
<p>" relations ; they were basely betrayed and trampled under foot ;
</p>
<p>i ( it was ill-organized, a premature, a foolish, and an absurd insurrec-
</p>
<p>" tion ; but you have a leader now who never will allow you to be led
</p>
<p>" astrav. Oh ! how delighted I am with the thorough conviction
</p>
<p>" that has come upon the minds of the people, that they could not
</p>
<p>" gratify their enemies more than by committing a crime. No, your
</p>
<p>" ancestors suffered for it ; they suffered for confiding in the English ;
</p>
<p> but we will never confide in them. They suffered for being divided
</p>
<p>M among themselves, but there is no division amongst us. They suffered
</p>
<p> for their own dissensions, and not for standing man by man by each
</p>
<p>857
</p>
<p>11 other's side. We will stand peaceably in the open day, side by side,
</p>
<p>" in defiance of every enemy. Oh ! how delighted I was in the scenes
</p>
<p>" which I came through here. How my heart throbbed; how my
</p>
<p>" spirit was elevated with the countenances I beheld. I was de-
</p>
<p>" lighted with the stalwart and strong men of Kildare." I need not,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, go further with that speech. At the conclusion of the
</p>
<p>morning meeting, a resolution was passed to the following effect, and
</p>
<p>you will see whether or not its language is in unison with the senti-
</p>
<p>ments openly expressed and inculcated by Mr. O'Connell, in the minds
</p>
<p>and feelings of those assembled thousands : " Resolved.  That this
</p>
<p>" meeting hereby declares its devoted loyalty to the person and throne
</p>
<p>" of Her Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, Queen of Ireland, and
</p>
<p>" its determination to uphold and maintain inviolate all the preroga-
</p>
<p>" tives of the Crown, as guaranteed by the Constitution." That was
</p>
<p>carried unanimously. The next resolution is : " That we, the clergy,
</p>
<p>" gentry, freeholders, burgesses, and other inhabitants of the province
</p>
<p>" of Leinster, in public meeting assembled, declare and pronounce, in
</p>
<p>" the presence of our country, before Europe and America, and in the
</p>
<p>"sight of Heaven, that no power on earth ought of right to make
</p>
<p>" laws to bind this kingdom, save the Queen, Lords, and Commons, of
</p>
<p>" Ireland ; and here, standing on the graves of the martyred dead, we
</p>
<p>" solemnly pledge ourselves to use every constitutional exertion to free
</p>
<p>" this our native land from the tyranny of being legislated for by others
</p>
<p>" than her own inhabitants. '' That is the end of the morning meeting.
</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen of the Jury, the next transaction at that meet-
</p>
<p>ing at Mullaghmast, to which I shall call your attention, is a speech of
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett, who is accused as a conspirator in the present indictment.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett spoke after the dinner: "In the public prints, of which
</p>
<p>" I know something, we have been in the habit of comparing the pro-
</p>
<p>" gressively accumulating county meetings ; we have been in the
</p>
<p>" habit of comparing county meetings to the meeting at Tara; we
</p>
<p>" have been in the habit of saying, it was the best meeting except the
</p>
<p>" meeting at Tara; from this time forth we shall always say, it was

</p>
<p>" the best meeting we have had except Tara and Mullaghmast. This
</p>
<p>" was a most magnificent meeting, and an honour to the country, an
</p>
<p>" honour to the locality, and to the town which produced it. It was
</p>
<p>" a meeting that will be recorded in history, and recorded as one of
</p>
<p>" those events which have influenced that great success of national
</p>
<p>u independence which is now all but consummated." Influenced,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, by the monster meetings. " It is one of those incidents
</p>
<p>" of a great political secret, a secret invented by an illustrious indi-
</p>
<p>" vidual present, suggested, no doubt, and blessed as it has been, by
</p>
<p>a an all-wise Providence, that wills the regeneration of this country.
</p>
<p>" It is a great political secret, which has at last proved to the people
</p>
<p>" of this country, and will prove to mankind, that the many who
</p>
<p>" openly and peaceably combine, shall be more than a match for the
</p>
<p>" few who have hitherto successfully conspired, and cheated, and
</p>
<p>" trampled upon them. I confess that I sometimes feel that it was
</p>
<p>" almost a blessing, that Ireland has gone through these forty-three
</p>
<p>" years' ordeal, when it has produced such national virtue ; when it
</p>
<p>5r
</p>
<p>858
</p>
<p>" has consummated an important state secret, peaceful pressure from
</p>
<p>" without." There might he two meanings to that, Gentlemen.
</p>
<p>Recollect he begins by saying, that these great meetings were the
</p>
<p>means by which, it may be said in history, these ends were accom-
</p>
<p>plished. " And when it has generated so many virtues in a long op-
</p>
<p>" pressed people, it is almost worth the ordeal we have gone through.
</p>
<p>" It has been said, that as we visited the Hill of Tara to recall the
</p>
<p>" virtues and glorious days of Irishmen, in order to awaken the sen-
</p>
<p>' timents by which we may be restored to independence, so we visit
</p>
<p>" the Rath of Mullaghmast to-day, to recollect the treachery by
</p>
<p>" which Ireland was betrayed, and to prevent, as one of these letters
</p>
<p>" said, the credulity which would again expose this oppressed country
</p>
<p>" to Saxon turpitude. The English, to be sure, say that there never
</p>
<p>" was any massacre at Mullaghmast; and they say, if there was, was
</p>
<p>" it not ill-natured to revive recollections to embitter the feud be-
</p>
<p>" tween the two countries, when England is so tremblingly anxious to
</p>
<p>" do every justice to this country ? Is England thus anxious to do
</p>
<p>" it ? Are there symptoms of England being so anxious ? I know
</p>
<p>* that English writers at a later period have often been deceived
</p>
<p>" about the country, which has been so often written up or down.
</p>
<p>" The wretch of Glencore was called the good William ; and the
</p>
<p>" profligate harridan, Queen Elizabeth, the people called good Queen
</p>
<p>" Bess ; and when, even in our own times, Castlereagh said, in the
</p>
<p>" face of England, that he never heard of flogging of people in Ire-
</p>
<p>" land, while their ears were tingling with the groans of the dying
</p>
<p>" and the shrieks of the tormented ; when Sir Henry Hardinge could
</p>
<p>" say there was no torture in Affghan, no burning of live people, no
</p>
<p>" cruelty or outrage in the English army ; when he could say that, we
</p>
<p>" were all receiving letters in private of the most horrible cruelties;
</p>
<p>" and when we were taunted by the English press, most satisfactorily
</p>
<p>" and most conclusively, that there was no cruelty, because Sir Henry
</p>
<p>" Hardinge said it, a second Lord Castlereagh ; why, do you think
</p>
<p>u they will persuade you that there was no massacre at Mullaghmast.

</p>
<p>" They will persuade you it is not so in the books, because she never
</p>
<p>" confessed it ; but they say that we should not mention that. Are
</p>
<p>" we so well treated by the English people ? What confidence can
</p>
<p>" we place in her, when she will not even acknowledge her errors ?
</p>
<p>" Was there nothing like the massacre of Mullaghmast in the rebel-
</p>
<p>" lion of 1798, after the people were instigated to rebellion, and then
</p>
<p>" betrayed ? I will give you a more recent instance  the Reform
</p>
<p>"Bill. Did they give us our due share? Was not that Reform
</p>
<p>" Bill to betray the liberties of the country ? In fact the same exact
</p>
<p>*' trick cannot always be played twice. A set of chieftains may not
</p>
<p>" always be inveigled by the Government ; the times may alter, but
</p>
<p>' the spirit of England is the same, whether it is manifested in the
</p>
<p>" breaking of the solemn pledge of hospitality, or the solemn pledge
</p>
<p>" of political justice." That, Gentlemen, was Mr. Barrett's part in
</p>
<p>the drama so carried on at Mullaghmast. Mr. O'Connell made a speech
</p>
<p>also at the dinner or banquet at Mullaghmast. You are to judge whe-
</p>
<p>ther it is different from the tone and manner of his previous address to
</p>
<p>859
</p>
<p>the assembled multitudes. " Gentlemen, this was and is to me a
</p>
<p>" most delightful day ; a day full of consolation, because beaming
</p>
<p>'* with hope ; a day full of delight, because contradictory of the anti-
</p>
<p>" cipations of our enemies. Oh ! how glad I am that we determined
</p>
<p>",;to meet at Mullaghmast ! Yes, it has scattered into thin air every
</p>
<p>" conclusion that our enemies could entertain adverse to the progress
</p>
<p>" of the majestic cause of Repeal. They had two distinct proposi-
</p>
<p>c< tions to guard, the pernicious system of corruption : they first al-
</p>
<p>" lege that a feeling of indifference would follow from our recent
</p>
<p>" exertions ; they said, that we had been too fiery, and too sturdy,
</p>
<p>" and bustling; that we had too many great meetings, that the public ear
</p>
<p>" was palled, and the public taste disgusted, by the repetition of si-
</p>
<p>" milar scenes. They declared that the people would become indif-
</p>
<p>" ferent, and that in apathy and in silence our efforts for the regene-
</p>
<p>" ration of Ireland would terminate. Oh ! no, I knew there was no
</p>
<p>" fear of it, but that was the assertion of our enemies ; it was the
</p>
<p>" assertion of Government, and it was the policy of the Government.
</p>
<p>" They have acted upon it, and would do nothing during the last
</p>
<p>" Session, because they said, that if we were left alone we would do
</p>
<p>" nothing. Mullaghmast is my answer." That is, the assembly he
</p>
<p>had collected there. " At first, you remember, they threatened us
</p>
<p>" with war. Peel was valiant for his hour, and the Duke of VVelling-
</p>
<p>ii ton, of course, who was caught napping at Waterloo, one fine morn-
</p>
<p>" ing  the Duke of Wellington declared, there was nothing for it
</p>
<p>" but war; we replied in a tone of firm defiance, and the threat of
</p>
<p>" war vanished, as they say the exertions for Repeal would vanish.
</p>
<p>" They therefore brought out the Queen against us ; dear lady, I
</p>
<p>" have the greatest respect for her, but I know the words were not
</p>
<p>" her's; but I take her Speech, and that very Speech is the very
</p>
<p>" reason why we are here this evening for Ireland. We had made
</p>
<p>" those demonstrations of hundreds of thousands of fighting men ; one
</p>
<p>" would think you had a taste for fighting. They had met, and they had
</p>
<p>" proclaimed by their meeting the national determination for the rege-

</p>
<p>" neration of their country. Yes, it would have been enough to have
</p>
<p>" exhibited the national will in the meetings that preceded that Speech,
</p>
<p>" but it became necessary to show that there was nothing in the mi-
</p>
<p>" nisterial Speech, though put into the mouth of the Sovereign, that
</p>
<p>" could deter resolute and rational men from the pursuit of their liber-
</p>
<p>" ty; and if instead of one Speech she had made a hundred Speeches,
</p>
<p>" the effect would have been precisely the same. We would not
</p>
<p>" have met at Mullaghmast to-day if it were not to show the futility
</p>
<p>" and falsehood of the expectation that it would run out, otherwise
</p>
<p>" this meeting would not have been necessary ; a few more we shall
</p>
<p>" now have by way of a tilly." He continued still to be the manager
</p>
<p>of those meetings. " I have five or six or seven yet unarranged ;
</p>
<p>" these at least we shall have ; and I think by that time the Ministry
</p>
<p>" will be tolerably convinced that the do-nothing policy will not heal
</p>
<p>" the sores of Ireland, or profit their policy much. I confess my
</p>
<p>" apprehensions were of a different kind. I was afraid that, instead
</p>
<p>" of indifference, over impatience would have sprung. I was afraid
</p>
<p>860
</p>
<p>" that somewhere there would have heen an outburst to gratify the
</p>
<p>" enemy  that would delight Sir Henry Hardinge, and would give
</p>
<p>" employment for those who eat the biscuit and drink the brandy
</p>
<p>" in his barracks. Oh ! do you tell me  no, you need not  was not
</p>
<p>" the determination expressed for every man to abide his hour, to
</p>
<p>" wait his time, to take no other step but those which the counsel
</p>
<p>" of wise men, and the sanction of the annointed priests of God,
</p>
<p>" should offer to him, as the mode of obtaining the liberty of his
</p>
<p>" country. Every man is as convinced as I am of two things ;
</p>
<p>" first, that Repeal can be obtained ; secondly, that the only way
</p>
<p>" to attain it is, the peaceful uprising of the masses, and swelling
</p>
<p>" above all the pitiful, and paltry, and minor difficulties that are in
</p>
<p>" the way." The peaceful uprising of the masses ! " I am certain of it,
</p>
<p>" my mind rests at ease, I can sleep to-night tranquilly, and perhaps
</p>
<p>" dream of Ireland ; I will awake thinking of the next step in the pro-
</p>
<p>" gress of freedom, and those steps are not difficult. The admiuis-
</p>
<p>" tration of the law." That is in the Courts of Justice. Now mind
</p>
<p>this, Gentlemen, it relates to one of the objects of the imputed
</p>
<p>conspiracy. " The administration of the law we want to get out
</p>
<p>" of the hands of the enemy; the Arbitration Courts are work-
</p>
<p>" ing well, and there are already Judges selected by themselves. 
</p>
<p>" [A. cry of' Blackrock.'] Oh! there is not a rock of any colour
</p>
<p>" but where we will have them. I want to show the nations of Eu-
</p>
<p>" rope that we are capable of administering our judicial business our-
</p>
<p>" selves, that we do not want the Saxon and the stranger, and above
</p>
<p>" all, we do not want bigoted men to serve us to do our business.
</p>
<p>" We will show we are capable and worthy of making our own laws,
</p>
<p>" for we will administer the law that others make ; but we will ad-
</p>
<p>" minister it,''  we will administer it,  " in the spirit of equity and
</p>
<p>" of justice, mitigating its harshness, and doing impartial justice to
</p>
<p>" every one who approaches our tribunal.'' " It is not by accident''
</p>
<p>(and here he recurs to the same defamatory matter again,)  " it is
</p>
<p>" not by accident that to-night we are on the Rath of Mullaghmast ;

</p>
<p>" it was deliberate design. And yet it is curious what a spot we are
</p>
<p>" assembled on ; I anticipated it, and I now rejoice in it; where my
</p>
<p>" voice is sounding, and you are quiet hearers attentively listening,
</p>
<p>" there was once raised the yell of despair, the groans of approach-
</p>
<p>" ing death, the agony of inflicted wounds on the perishing and the
</p>
<p>" unarmed ; in this very spot they fell beneath the swords of the
</p>
<p>" Saxon, who used them securely and delightfully, grinding their
</p>
<p>" victims to death. Here the Saxon triumphed; here he raised a
</p>
<p>" shout of victory over his unarmed prey ; upon this very spot three
</p>
<p>" hundred able men perished, who, confiding in Saxon promises,
</p>
<p>** came to a conference of the Queen's subjects, and in the merri-
</p>
<p>" menl of the banquet they were slaughtered." Is not that the
</p>
<p>very story that was circulated round the Rath of Mullaghmast in the
</p>
<p>morning? " They never returned home but one ; their wives were
</p>
<p>"widowed, their children were orphans; in their homesteads the
</p>
<p>" shriek of despair, the father and the husband steeped in their own
</p>
<p>" blood. Their wives and mothers wept over them in vain. Oh !
</p>
<p>861
</p>
<p>*' Saxon cruelty ! how it does delight my heart to think you dare not
</p>
<p>'' attempt such a feat again!" Not that you would not, but that you
</p>
<p>dare not. " Let every mother who hears me, only throw her re-
</p>
<p>" collection hack to the homes of the mothers on the ensuing mom-
</p>
<p>" ing. Only let them imagine for a moment, that the father of her
</p>
<p>" children was to be brought home on the morrow a bloody corpse.
</p>
<p>" So it was with the mother of these Irish chieftains. Their hus-
</p>
<p>" bands left in the pride of manhood, in the force of strength ; they
</p>
<p>" left capable of defending them against every enemy; they were
</p>
<p>" brought home in the inanity of death, incapable of affording
</p>
<p>" any protection, or giving any other sensation, but that of grief
</p>
<p>"and interminable sorrow. Oh! England, England! thy crimes
</p>
<p>" have filled the cup of bitterness, and the hour of the vengeance
</p>
<p>" of God, I much fear, cannot be far from you." Supposing there
</p>
<p>were any truth in this story, it is two hundred and fifty years
</p>
<p>ago. " At all events, suffering Ireland, you will have your days
</p>
<p>" of glory. You have suffered much, and you have committed no
</p>
<p>" infliction in return. I defy Saxon ingenuity and falsehood to
</p>
<p>" show me any treaty the Irish violated ; to show me any one coui-
</p>
<p>" pact they ever broke; to show me any one faith they plighted they
</p>
<p>"did not redeem. Oh! my glorious countrymen, endowed with
</p>
<p>" every virtue, the contrast between you and your oppressors is to
</p>
<p>" me the subject of exultation. In everything you have proved your
</p>
<p>" virtue and generosity ; in everything they have proved their
</p>
<p>" cruelty and their treachery." Now, Gentlemen of the Jury, ask
</p>
<p>yourselves is that free discussion ? Is that the language of fair in-
</p>
<p>vestigation and inquiry, or is it excitement of the most extraordinary
</p>
<p>kind, produced by the repetition of stories, for the truth of which
</p>
<p>the person who narrated them could not vouch ? Was this a fair
</p>
<p>sample of legitimate discussion, or was it evidence of hatred steeped
</p>
<p>in an infusion of gall and bitterness? Recollect, that was the second
</p>
<p>speech at which he had introduced that subject on that same day;
</p>
<p>recollect, that he had chosen and nominated this place of meeting

</p>
<p>for the purpose of bringing before the assembled multitudes the
</p>
<p>recollection of the alleged atrocities, barbarities, and cruelties of
</p>
<p>England against Ireland ; he chose that to be the place where he
</p>
<p>would bring together, and make a display of a greater number of
</p>
<p>men than had ever been assembled at any of the monster meetings,
</p>
<p>with the exception, perhaps, of that of Tara, at which he appears to
</p>
<p>have stated there were assembled at least a million and a half of
</p>
<p>persons. What object had he in that? What object had those
</p>
<p>who accompanied him, who partook of the banquet which was cele-
</p>
<p>brated under such circumstances ? W 7 hat object had they in going
</p>
<p>there and making speeches to the like tendency, and with the like
</p>
<p>effect ? Were they conspirators, or were they not ? Were they,
</p>
<p>or were they not, joined and confederated in one and the same com-
</p>
<p>mon design? What their design was is somewhat evidenced by
</p>
<p>what occurred at another place  at the Repeal Meeting at Tulla-
</p>
<p>more, the evidence of which has been detailed before you upon oath
</p>
<p>by an apparently trust-worthy person, at least a person without iin-
</p>
<p>862
</p>
<p>peachment, by name John Ulrek M'Namara. I am not going to
</p>
<p>detain you long with this ; but there is a curious passage in his
</p>
<p>account of this meeting. After having given a detail generally about
</p>
<p>the masses, about the banners, and about the arch, which was after-
</p>
<p>wards taken down by Mr. Steele, and to which I do not now further
</p>
<p>allude, it appears that the meeting was held, and Mr. O'Connell joined
</p>
<p>it. He said, that " the Rev. Mr. Nolan, of Dunkerrin, moved the
</p>
<p>" adoption of a petition to Parliament, praying for a Repeal of that
</p>
<p>" fatal measure, the Union." That is quite regular, and quite
</p>
<p>proper ; but was such a petition prepared or signed by any body, or ever
</p>
<p>presented to Parliament ? Of that you have no evidence. However
</p>
<p>a design may be masked, it is the duty of the jury to see what the real
</p>
<p>character of it was. But there is a part which struck me as very curious.
</p>
<p>" The Reverend Mr. Kearney: I hold in my hand a resolution for
</p>
<p>" the adoption of this great and important meeting [Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>" was present at the time of making this speech] pledging them to
</p>
<p>" perseverance in the agitation that has been set on foot by the Li-
</p>
<p>" berator of the country, and has continued so long, to the great
</p>
<p>" credit of the nation. As no political good was ever achieved by
</p>
<p>" depressing the people, so no public grievance was ever redressed
</p>
<p>" but through the exertion, determination, and perseverance of the
</p>
<p>'' people.
</p>
<p>" ' Freedom's battle once begun,
</p>
<p>" ' Though baffled oft, is ever won.'
</p>
<p>" Repeal will be won, and I doubt not at no very distant day. Peel
</p>
<p>" has admitted the evils of Ireland, and that he has no remedy ; he
</p>
<p>" must give up to somebody. The Whigs, who boast of having con-
</p>
<p>" ferred so much on Ireland, and boast more of what they would
</p>
<p>" confer were it not for the opposition of the Tories, would, of
</p>
<p>" course, come in." That is, if the present Administration went
</p>
<p>" out. " They imagine, that by a course of liberal government in
</p>
<p>" Ireland they could put a stop to the Repeal agitation ; by giving
</p>
<p>" up the church temporalities ; that by enlarging the franchise and

<p>" increasing the constituency in Ireland, they hope to detach us from
</p>
<p>" the great and paramount consideration of this question. They might
</p>
<p>" concede all these, and even more. Most likely they would tempt
</p>
<p>" the Liberator with fine promises, in addition to some good acts ;
</p>
<p>" he was too wise for them ; he was never yet overreached by an
</p>
<p>" English Government; he has always been the watchful, wary, and
</p>
<p>" undeceived advocate of his country's wrongs, and we may safely
</p>
<p>" leave him to take every thing that they give ; but as soon as he
</p>
<p>" gets all, never was the steam of Repeal up till then." That is the
</p>
<p>character of Mr. O'Connell given by his friend, the Reverend Mr.
</p>
<p>Kearney, who appears to have introduced him with those sentiments,
</p>
<p>and that description, in the way of eulogy. " Allow me, then, not
</p>
<p>to take up your time any longer, to read the resolution." Now did
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell deny that, when he came to speak ? Did he dissent
</p>
<p>or differ from that ? Did he say that he would be professing one
</p>
<p>thing, and acting upon another ; that that would be base and disin-
</p>
<p>863
</p>
<p>genuous ; that he rejected and repudiated it ? Nothing of the sort.
</p>
<p>Here is what he said about it ; this is from Mr. O'Connell's speech :
</p>
<p>" When I addressed former meetings, I told them to join me, and
</p>
<p>" all would soon be right ; but now I tell you that it is all right, the
</p>
<p>" nail is in the hole [a voice, ' drive it home,'] aye, drive it home,
</p>
<p>" and I will clench it on the other side. I am quite ready to respect
</p>
<p>" the vested rights of persons at present in possession, but though I
</p>
<p>" am content, I see from what fell from my friend Mr. Robinson,
</p>
<p>" that it is not safe for the parsons to delay in joining with
</p>
<p>* us to have an adjustment of church property. We will take
</p>
<p>" any thing we get now, but if they delay, we will take the whole ;
</p>
<p>" we will have egg, shell, and all ; but at present, such an arrange-
</p>
<p>" ment might be made as would fully secure to them the benefit of
</p>
<p>" their vested rights." And he concludes that speech thus : " I
</p>
<p>"claim the highest meed of praise for Irishmen. Oh! little the
</p>
<p>" Saxon knows that gentleness of manners that arises under religious
</p>
<p>" enthusiasm, that forbearance that springs from the religious prin-
</p>
<p>" ciple deeply impressed upon your hearts from your earliest infancy.
</p>
<p>" But it is that very religious forbeai-ance that makes you kind to
</p>
<p>" each other, and that enables your women to come into the greatest
</p>
<p>" throngs without being injured, and certain of not being insulted.
</p>
<p>" But if it should be necessary for you to remain in the field till
</p>
<p>" blood shall flow, general never stood by such soldiers ; I have the
</p>
<p>" bravest and most moral people in the world to deal with. But you
</p>
<p>" must combine, there must be no treachery among you, and it is
</p>
<p>" treachery to vote for any one but a Repealer. I have heard of
</p>
<p>" some parish in this county where some Repealers voted for a Tory ;
</p>
<p>" however, we will say no more about it at present, but now I give
</p>
<p>" command, never to vote for any Tory, nor for any one else but a
</p>
<p>" Repealer. A friend of mine was coming down from Dublin, and
</p>
<p>" saw a man working in a kind of Botany Bay of his own ; a num-
</p>
<p>" ber of men were working together near him, but left him to work
</p>
<p>" in a part by himself, solitary and alone, and refused to hold any

</p>
<p>" intercourse with him. My friend was afraid that they belonged
</p>
<p>" to some secret society, and addressing them said, that he hoped
</p>
<p>" they were not Ribbonmen, that they refused to let that poor fel-
</p>
<p>" low into their company ; but what was their answer? ' Oh ! that
</p>
<p>" fellow refused to become a Repealer.' These good men were
</p>
<p>u combined for the cause of Repeal, and it is absolutely necessary
</p>
<p>" that you should be doubly active now; I cannot afford to leave
</p>
<p>" out man, woman, or child, without becoming Repealers. Let every
</p>
<p>" one join with me in the call for Repeal, and the shout"  not the
</p>
<p>free discussion  " will reverberate to England ; the Saxon will be
</p>
<p>" aroused from his slumber, the echo will be borne on the wild
</p>
<p>" waves, and the Union shall be, must be repealed."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the next speech made by one of these gentlemen
</p>
<p>who are accused of this conspiracy, at that meeting at Mullaghmast,
</p>
<p>was by Mr. Ray. It has been said by the counsel for Mr. Ray,
</p>
<p>that he was only a servant of the Association, a hired servant, and
</p>
<p>acted in the earning of his wages. If it were so, Gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>864
</p>
<p>Jury, if that were all that Mr. Ray ever did, why, I would say he is
</p>
<p>just as guilty as if he were not the Secretary of the Association at all.
</p>
<p>His receiving wages from that Association, if he do, no more entitles
</p>
<p>him to commit a crime, than if he held no situation of the kind. It
</p>
<p>might as well be said (I do not know whether any of you are old
</p>
<p>enough to remember the transaction) that Scotch Andrew could not
</p>
<p>have been guilty of the murder of Mr. M'Donnell, because he was in
</p>
<p>the service of his master Mr. Fitzgerald, and acted under his orders;
</p>
<p>yet Scotch Andrew was tried, convicted, and executed for the
</p>
<p>offence. But here Mr. Ray was not confining himself to his office and
</p>
<p>situation of Secretary. " Mr. Ray  The toast which you havepro-
</p>
<p>" posed, and which I have the honour to respond to, presents a most
</p>
<p>" gratifying theme ; and who would have thought a twelvemonth ago
</p>
<p>" that our Repeal Association would be at the present moment in its
</p>
<p>" towering career? No one could have supposed it except one, the
</p>
<p>" master-mind who designed it ; he knew very well where native sen-
</p>
<p>" timent existed, and his power ; all I now ask you is, where is the
</p>
<p>" Government that can measure our power? Where is the Ministry
</p>
<p><' that would dare coerce us ? and what are the objects of the Repeal
</p>
<p>" Association?" This is at Mullaghmast, Gentlemen ; it is the third
</p>
<p>of the speeches I am referring to. " To give to the people employ-
</p>
<p>M ment, to give them food, to give them raiment, to give them com-
</p>
<p>" fort ; to give Ireland a name and fame, and to teach her people that
</p>
<p>" she is a country worth living for. The career of the Association at
</p>
<p>" present is yet but short, but short as the period has been, it has
</p>
<p>" done much for the people ; there is no desire which it will not
</p>
<p>" speedily accomplish, already it has brought to the door of the poor
</p>
<p>" man that inestimable luxury, cheap justice." Now this is in refer-
</p>
<p>ence to the Arbitration Courts ; here is another of the objects of the
</p>
<p>alleged common design. " Arbitration Courts have been established
</p>
<p> for the first time, and the poor man can taste of that jewel beyond
</p>
<p>" all praise, and dissolve it in the bitter cup that has been filled to the
</p>
<p><< brim ; he has cheap justice at his door, which neutralizes or miti-

<p>" gates his bitter draught. It only remains for the people to perse-
</p>
<p>" vere as thev will. Have you any security for your rights ? Have
</p>
<p>" you any protection for the remainder of your liberties? You have
</p>
<p>** not, except by compact and organization ; organization, therefore, is
</p>
<p> policy and safety. If you are not willing to lie down as slaves, you
</p>
<p>" must join the Association, upon which your only hopes of redress
</p>
<p>" ever can be placed. It is your duty to follow the advice of the great
</p>
<p>" Liberator, who never led you astray, or will  whom you are pre-
</p>
<p>" pared, I will say, to follow in whatever course he may suggest to
</p>
<p>' you, come woe, come weal, for the purpose of asserting the liberties
</p>
<p>" of your country; he has never led you from the proper course, and
</p>
<p>" I am sure he never will. Your unlimited confidence isjustty and
</p>
<p> properly placed in him, and his will is and must be your law. I am
</p>
<p>" now addressing an enlightened audience, the representatives of the
</p>
<p>" feelings of the people of Ireland, and I appeal to you, Gentle-
</p>
<p>" men, that you do not suffer this meeting, or the like, to evapo-
</p>
<p>" rate and to vanish without carrying out those principles, the
</p>
<p>865
</p>
<p>44 details of which are equally important to the exhibition of the
</p>
<p>44 power of the masses." Which is so necessary for the achievement
</p>
<p>of their ends? " You will organize your districts, and do not stop
</p>
<p>44 until the length and breadth of the land is ascertained by Repeal
</p>
<p>44 Wardens, and the simple machinery, and the system proposed by
</p>
<p>" the Repeal Association  until the spirit of Ireland be ample  until
</p>
<p>44 all act with one will. Such will be the means of attaining our inde-
</p>
<p>44 pendence, and the consummation of that rests only upon the period
</p>
<p>" of time in which the result will be followed and carried out. But
</p>
<p>44 now, my friends, standing upon this Rath,''  here again making an
</p>
<p>allusion to the same dreadful massacre,  "which must be a perpetual
</p>
<p>44 monument of British perfidy, in the dread presence of those mar-
</p>
<p>14 tyred spirits, we have assembled this day to record, that although
</p>
<p>" as Christian men we may forgive those atrocities, that we never will
</p>
<p>44 hereafter be guilty of a treason to ourselves or our country, in
</p>
<p>44 confiding for one moment in the British. We will pursue our ob-
</p>
<p>44 jects firmly and steadily, without deviating on the one side or the
</p>
<p>44 other, till the palladium of Irish liberty shall be safely enshrined
</p>
<p>44 in its congenial temple in College-green.''
</p>
<p>There are three persons, whose speeches I have read ; Mr. John
</p>
<p>O'Connell also spoke at the dinner  there were four of the alleged
</p>
<p>conspirators present. Dr. Gray was the fifth, who also spoke at the
</p>
<p>meeting; and Dr. Gray spoke with reference to his peculiar part of
</p>
<p>this which appears to be a general system  the setting up of Courts
</p>
<p>of their own, appointed by the people and not by the Crown. He
</p>
<p>said : " I have often felt proud on many occasions, when I was warm-
</p>
<p>44 ly received by my fellow-coutrymen, for I knew I had no right
</p>
<p>44 whatever to a warm reception ; they saw that there was great sin-
</p>
<p>cerity in the common cause, but on no occasion did 1 ever feel
</p>
<p>44 more pride than I do now  proud not only at my name being con-
</p>
<p>44 nected with the Arbitrators of Ireland ; proud not only of the re-
</p>
<p>44 ception you have given me, and of that toast ; but proud that in this
</p>
<p>44 assembly of Irishmen I stand up to return thanks, not on behalf of

<p>44 this class or of that class, but on behalf of the Judges appointed by
</p>
<p>44 the people; for the first time, the people's Judges. For a long
</p>
<p>44 time past they were in the habit of being ruled, and governed, and
</p>
<p>44 trampled upon by aliens and enemies;"  does that mean the exist-
</p>
<p>ing Courts, through which justice has been administered by the
</p>
<p>Queen's Judges?  44 by enemies who, though living among us, were
</p>
<p>44 not our friends, but our foes, who lived among us till they found
</p>
<p>44 out that which gave them an opportunity for the exercise of their
</p>
<p>44 petty malicious tyranny. But now we have persons as our Judges,
</p>
<p>44 men selected among ourselves, appointed by ourselves, deriving
</p>
<p>44 their authority, not from any patent appointment," in the way in
</p>
<p>which the Queen's Judges are appointed. u not from any constituted
</p>
<p>assembly, but deriving it directly and solely from ourselves."
</p>
<p>There, Gentlemen, I close my reading and observations upon the
</p>
<p>day of Mullaghmast  a most important meeting, exhibiting more than
</p>
<p>any perhaps that has taken place, to you who are bound to decide in
</p>
<p>this case according to your sound judgment, and according to the
</p>
<p>5s
</p>
<p>866
</p>
<p>truth, what were the real intentions of the several parties that are ac-
</p>
<p>cused before you of having entered into this alleged conspiracy and
</p>
<p>common design. The general objects of that meeting have been
</p>
<p>brought before your minds, as furnishing more or less evidence of this
</p>
<p>general design, entertained and inculcated by the principal speakers
</p>
<p>upon that occasion ; evidence of exciting discontent, hatred, and
</p>
<p>animosity in the people of Ireland against the people of England for
</p>
<p>by-gone scenes and offences, the truth of which cannot be ascertained,
</p>
<p>but which, if ever they did exist, were (to say the least of it) now
</p>
<p>gratuitously brought before the public mind, and the consideration of
</p>
<p>this assembled multitude. Now there was present, who took an ac-
</p>
<p>tive part in that meeting, Mr. O'Connell, senior, who made two
</p>
<p>speeches; Mr. O'Connell, senior, who was the person who gave
</p>
<p>his orders for the procuring of that assembly ; Mr. O'Connell, senior,
</p>
<p>who selected that place because it was the scene of that former alleged
</p>
<p>bloody massacre, perpetrated two hundred and fifty years ago by the
</p>
<p>English of that day against the Irish of that time, to revive and to
</p>
<p>bring to light again, the feelings which must have dwelt in the hearts
</p>
<p>and minds of those at that time connected with the sufferers in that
</p>
<p>tragedy. You recollect how he has described it, how he has painted
</p>
<p>the scenes of misery and wretchedness, which must have seized upon
</p>
<p>and overwhelmed the feelings of every person who was connected
</p>
<p>with those who perished. It was not for nothing, he said, he brought
</p>
<p>them to that place, and he makes that speech, standing (as he says)
</p>
<p>upon the spot where the tragedy was committed  where every thing
</p>
<p>that Ireland at that time ought to have held dear was sacri6ced to the
</p>
<p>cruelty and treachery of the Government of the country at that time.
</p>
<p>It was to revive and to recall the feelings that he described as exist-
</p>
<p>ing in the hearts of those relatives, and to infuse the same into the
</p>
<p>breasts of those of the present day, who were listening to the eloquent
</p>
<p>way in which he portrayed those horrible scenes. What is the accu-
</p>
<p>sation founded upon it? The accusation is for endeavouring to ex-
</p>
<p>cite and to raise discontent and disaffection in one part of Her Ma-

</p>
<p>jesty's subjects against the other, especially the Irish against the
</p>
<p>English. Does this, or does it not, support that charge? That is
</p>
<p>for you to say. They say that all this takes place for the purpose of
</p>
<p>promoting free discussion, and fair and candid inquiry as to the pru-
</p>
<p>dence of repealing the Union. But is that the only ground on which
</p>
<p>this transaction bears upon the present case ? That assembly, so
</p>
<p>met, consisted of as many men, as many persons, as were assem-
</p>
<p>bled upon the hill of Tara  the greatest monster meeting that
</p>
<p>up to that time had ever taken place in Ireland ; were those
</p>
<p>thousands to have their feelings excited, and were the British
</p>
<p>Ministry to be told, were the British Parliament to be told, that those
</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands of people, organized and disciplined, excited
</p>
<p>in the manner that you have heard stated by the parties themselves,
</p>
<p>existed in the country in such a state of discipline, that the moment
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell thought proper to stamp his foot, or to raise his hand,
</p>
<p>those multitudes would re-assemble, no matter what his command
</p>
<p>867
</p>
<p>might be ? Now, Gentlemen, does that go to support their allega-
</p>
<p>tion that this is free discussion ; or does it go to support, or is it
</p>
<p>evidence to support, the imputation alleged by the Crown, that this
</p>
<p>was a collection of those masses and multitudes of persons for the
</p>
<p>purpose of intimidation, and for the purpose of overawing the Legisla-
</p>
<p>ture of the country? I am bound to put both these respective views
</p>
<p>before you ; it is for you to decide. There is yet another charge,
</p>
<p>that of exciting discontent and disaffection against the law and Con-
</p>
<p>stitution of the country. What was that law, and that Constitution,
</p>
<p>as by law established ? The law of the Union-, which is the lawof the land,
</p>
<p>and no other, at this day. And upon that occasion it was proclaimed by
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell to the hundreds of thousands that were listening to him,
</p>
<p>that the Union was a nullity, that it was absolutely void. Was this for
</p>
<p>the purpose (and it is for you to say) of exciting discontent and dis-
</p>
<p>affection amongst the subjects of this country against the law and in-
</p>
<p>stitutions of the country? Another branch of this charge of conspi-
</p>
<p>racy is the depreciating the Courts of Justice, as established by law,
</p>
<p>and the Constitution of the realm, in this country ; bringing them
</p>
<p>into contempt, and inducing the subjects of the realm to withdraw
</p>
<p>the adjustment of their disputes and differences from the Courts ap-
</p>
<p>pointed under the Queen's authority, and inducing the subjects of
</p>
<p>the country to go to other tribunals for the adjustment of those dif-
</p>
<p>ferences. Is theie any evidence, in the transactions at Mullagh-
</p>
<p>mast, given you, in support of that charge of the alleged conspiracy ?
</p>
<p>Have you, or have you not, Dr. Gray coming forward, and making
</p>
<p>his statement in the presence of those assembled masses, that the
</p>
<p>time was come when they were to be relieved from the manner in
</p>
<p>which their affairs had been conducted in those Courts, over which
</p>
<p>presided the Saxon, or the stranger, or those who, being settled here,
</p>
<p>had taken the advantage of petty opportunities to put into execution
</p>
<p>their plans of tyranny and oppression ? Have you, or have you not,
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell adverting to the same system ? He had, at the
</p>
<p>meeting at Clifden, proclaimed the same subject, and he had stated

</p>
<p>there that the institution of these Arbitration Courts was the founda-
</p>
<p>tion of his judicial system; you find him again recurring to the same
</p>
<p>subject, recommending in the same way, at this meeting at Mul-
</p>
<p>laghmast, the appointment of those Arbitration Courts, and the
</p>
<p>placing therein the magistrates who had been dismissed by the
</p>
<p>Chancellor for their attendance upon the Repeal meetings. There
</p>
<p>you have three individuals, and you have Mr. Ray, moreover,
</p>
<p>adding his mite in recommendation of that common cause. You
</p>
<p>have therefore four, and you have Mr. John O'Connell, a fifth, who
</p>
<p>likewise made a speech at that meeting, concurred in the general
</p>
<p>objects of that meeting, and appears to have been himself one of the
</p>
<p>first Arbitrators who took upon himself to act under that appointment
</p>
<p>at Blackrock, concurring thereby fully in that establishment of the
</p>
<p>Arbitration Court, appointed under the authority of the Association.
</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen, I have thus pointed out to you distinctly the
</p>
<p>bearing that the Mullaghmast meeting has upon almost all the objects
</p>
<p>868
</p>
<p>of this accusation; I have also pointed out to you the particular per-
</p>
<p>sons of the accused upon whom it bears. Hitherto 1 have said no-
</p>
<p>thing of the Rev. Mr. Tierney, who does not appear to have attended
</p>
<p>or participated in that Association, in its meetings, nor in this Mul-
</p>
<p>laghmast meeting ; nor, as I understand, is there evidence that he
</p>
<p>became a member of the Association until the 3rd of October follow-
</p>
<p>ing, which was the day but one after the meeting at Mullaghmast.
</p>
<p>It is true that he had a little pet meeting of his own, in his own parish
</p>
<p>of Clontibret, on the 15th of August, the very same day on which
</p>
<p>the great meeting was held upon the hill of Tara. Now, with regard
</p>
<p>to the meeting at Clontibret on the 15th of August, that appears to
</p>
<p>have gone off with more decorum and propriety than attended any of
</p>
<p>the meetings that I have referred to. At Clontibret there were ma-
</p>
<p>gistrates of the county as such in attendance, there were police in
</p>
<p>attendance ; and I do not think the meeting of Clontibret has been
</p>
<p>much pressed against the Rev. Mr. Tierney. I concur in that view,
</p>
<p>the more particularly as some little uncertainty appears to exist with
</p>
<p>regard to the parol evidence given by M'Cann, the police constable,
</p>
<p>who was examined as to what took place between him and Mr. Tier-
</p>
<p>ney on the 15th of June, two months before that meeting. I do not
</p>
<p>mean to impute anything to Mr. M'Cann, but it did appear that Mr.
</p>
<p>M'Cann, in the discharge of his duty as constable, with reference
</p>
<p>to what might take place between him and Mr. Tierney, did certainly
</p>
<p>at first conceive that he ought to have kept a diary or journal, and
</p>
<p>that he did at one time write a journal of what took place, but that
</p>
<p>journal is not forthcoming ; and, therefore, Gentlemen of the Jury,
</p>
<p>I think there is a blot upon that man's testimony, and I should be
</p>
<p>unwilling to call your attention, under the circumstances, to his evi-
</p>
<p>dence against the traverser. I am confining myself now to the meet-
</p>
<p>ing at Clontibret. There is no question as to what passed afterwards
</p>
<p>with regard to Mr. Tierney, and lam the more disposed to take
</p>
<p>that course with respect to Mr. Tierney, at Clontibret, because
</p>
<p>he appears to be a gentleman who had conducted himself in the
</p>

</p>
<p>country with the propriety and correctness, which one hopes, and
</p>
<p>which one might expect, to meet with from a gentleman of his
</p>
<p>cloth. The policeman was the only person who was examined,
</p>
<p>and he admitted, upon his cross-examination, the general high es-
</p>
<p>timation in which Mr. Tierney was personally held, and he added,
</p>
<p>that in the discharge of his duty as policeman, he had more
</p>
<p>than once received assistance from him. That is creditable to him.
</p>
<p>But now, Gentlemen, suppose we impute nothing to him for the trans-
</p>
<p>action of the 15th of August. What, then, took place on the 3rd of
</p>
<p>October, and this is worth your consideration. Mr. Tierney attended
</p>
<p>at the Repeal Association on Monday the 3rd of October ; that was
</p>
<p>the day but one after that great meeting at Mullaghmast, at which
</p>
<p>those resolutions were entered into to which I have called your atten-
</p>
<p>tion. Whether Mr. Tierney knew, or did not know, of the existence,
</p>
<p>or particulars, or nature of those proceedings, I do not exclude from
</p>
<p>your consideration ; he certainly might have known them, and the
</p>
<p>869
</p>
<p>fact was so recent, and the place so near, that it will be for you to
</p>
<p>say whether he could have avoided knowing them  .not near where
</p>
<p>he lives, but near where he was on the Monday following, in the city
</p>
<p>of Dublin ; it was the very day afterwards, or the day but one I think,
</p>
<p>Mr. Tierney came to a meeting of the Association, and Mr. Tierney
</p>
<p>then and there made a speech ; it will be for you to say, and to judge
</p>
<p>of the character and nature of that speech. He is charged with con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, and you will take it into your consideration, how far or other-
</p>
<p>wise the objects of that speech fall in with and partake of the general
</p>
<p>nature of the common design. The Reverend Mr. Tierney : " It is an
</p>
<p>" old story, but it is not the less valuable on that account, that a thing
</p>
<p>" once well begun is more than half finished. Repeal has had a no-
</p>
<p>" ble beginning this year; and from the glorious progress it is mak-
</p>
<p>" ing, I ask, why do the countless multitudes who surround the Libe-
</p>
<p>" rator wherever he goes through the provinces, numberless as the
</p>
<p>" waves of the ocean, assemble ?" That was in reference to what had
</p>
<p>taken place a few days ago. " Or, why do so many of yourselves
</p>
<p>" congregate together here around him ? Is it for the purpose of
</p>
<p>" looking at the illustrious individual, to do honour to his presence?
</p>
<p>" Is it to gaze upon the greatest friend of the human race ? Is it to
</p>
<p>" feast the eye to satiety upon one who is marked out by Divine Pro-
</p>
<p>" vidence as the saviour of his country? No, though that would be
</p>
<p>" justifiable in you, still you come here for a better purpose, and for
</p>
<p>" a holier purpose; you come here to help him, to assist him in res-
</p>
<p>" cuing your country from a state of slavery, to be a free nation ; you
</p>
<p>" come here to enable him to make your own Ireland, the land of your
</p>
<p>" birth, the land of the happy and the free. And, let me ask you,
</p>
<p>" are you all prepared to do so? [Cries of 'Yes, yes.'] If you are,
</p>
<p>' give him deeds as well as words. I can answer for the county I
</p>
<p>" have the honour to belong to, Monaghan, and for the parish that I
</p>
<p>" have also the honour of being the priest of, that there we are deter-
</p>
<p>" mined to give our hands as well as our hearts. We are determined to
</p>
<p>" give him acts as well as deeds, and not to leave in his power, or in the

<p>" power of others, to say the people of the North are cold and frozen,
</p>
<p>" like the region they inhabit ; the iron has sunk deep into their hearts,
</p>
<p>" they love not liberty, they deserve to be slaves. Oh ! there was a time
</p>
<p>" when the people of the North, aye, and the men of Monaghan, were
</p>
<p>" found to be the first to resist and the last to bend to the proud
</p>
<p>" Saxon." Does Mr. Tierney fall into the common parlance of call-
</p>
<p>ing the English " the proud Saxon ?" Does he adopt that phrase so
</p>
<p>familiar in the annals of this Association ? " There was a time when
</p>
<p>" they did not shun the battle field : there was a time when they were
</p>
<p>" found to be the first to resist and the last to bend. Bear me witness
</p>
<p>" ye different streams of the Blackwater; bear me witness, the very
</p>
<p>" parish that I have the honour to come from, Clontibret ; bear me
</p>
<p>" witness, Benburb, and the battle of the Yellow Ford, in my neigh-
</p>
<p>" bourhood." It is rather a remarkable thing, Gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>Jury, and not to be overlooked altogether in this case, that the
</p>
<p>870
</p>
<p>green card, the members' card, is illustrated by these two names 
</p>
<p>Benburb, and the battle of the Yellow Ford  giving the Irish cha-
</p>
<p>racter and the Irish name for it ; which is explained by the letter of
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Callaghan, adopted by the Association. " These are bright
</p>
<p>" spots in the history of my locality; and as I am talking of bygone
</p>
<p>" times, permit me to bring to your recollection a few facts connected
</p>
<p>" with the history of my country." Facts ejusdem generis with the
</p>
<p>massacre of Mullaghmast; facts of cruelty and treachery perpetrated
</p>
<p>by Englishmen against Irishmen in the manner which he details ;
</p>
<p>facts of bygone times, to which he refers, in order to bring them be-
</p>
<p>fore the hearers of the present day, and those members of the Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation who were the possessors of the green card. Now listen to
</p>
<p>those statements, and see whether they are not gratuitously brought
</p>
<p>forward by this reverend gentleman :
</p>
<p>" In the year 1587"  you can easily tell how many years ago
</p>
<p>that is  " Hugh O'Neill was created Earl of Tyrone." He was then
</p>
<p>created by the Sovereign of Great Britain, Queen Elizabeth. " He
</p>
<p>" was then in the fiftieth year of his age ; he was one of the bravest
</p>
<p>" generals that ever commanded an Irish army. In the year 1588,
</p>
<p>" Sir William Fitzwilliam was Lord Deputy of Ireland"  that is the
</p>
<p>same as Lord Lieutenant  " he was a bloody and inhuman monster ;
</p>
<p>" he was a foul murderer and a robber. I shall mention to you a rob-
</p>
<p>" bery and murder he committed in my county. He had Red Hugh
</p>
<p>" Macmahon, chieftain of Monaghan, arrested upon a false charge
</p>
<p>" and brought to Dublin, he was however acquitted, and the Deputy
</p>
<p>" engaged to have him conducted in safety to his own house. On his
</p>
<p>" arrival there, he was seized by the English soldiers under the com-
</p>
<p>" mand of Sir Henry Bagnall." Had this Rev. Gentleman any com-
</p>
<p>mon design in communicating these particulars, of exciting discontent
</p>
<p>and hatred between the Irish, upon whom these murders and rob-
</p>
<p>beries were said to have been committed, and the English, which had
</p>
<p>long been forgotten, but which were revived by the Reverend Mr.
</p>
<p>Tierney ? " On his arrival there, he was seized by the English sol-

</p>
<p>" diers under the command of Sir Henry Bagnal ; he was executed
</p>
<p>" at his own door ; his head was struck off, and sent to the Castle of
</p>
<p>" Dublin, and his lands and estates were divided between the same
</p>
<p>" Sir Henry Bagnall, a Captain Ansley, and others of his English
</p>
<p>" murderers." There is then a tissue of stories comprising a history
</p>
<p>of the battle of Benburb, the battle of the Yellow Ford, and others,
</p>
<p>in which this Reverend Gentleman states that the Irish were victo-
</p>
<p>rious, and that the English were defeated with great slaughter.
</p>
<p>Why did he introduce these topics ? Was it for the purpose of
</p>
<p>showing that in former times the Irish were brave, and that they
</p>
<p>were (as he prefaces his statement by saying) " the first to resist and
</p>
<p>the last to yield ?" or were these facts of English perfidy, and Eng-
</p>
<p>lish cruelty, of Irish victory and English failure, brought forward for
</p>
<p>the purpose of promoting Christian charity and peace, after the lapse
</p>
<p>of a period of between two and three hundred years ? It is for you
</p>
<p>to say ; and I leave this, Gentlemen, most particularly to your con-
</p>
<p>871
</p>
<p>sideration, and I do not refer to the evidence of M'Cann, except so
</p>
<p>far as that was in his favour, but to the speech that the Reverend
</p>
<p>Mr. Tierney made upon the occasion alluded to.
</p>
<p>He concludes the statement of those facts thus : " I have said,
</p>
<p>you are always successful when you are united." United in the
</p>
<p>field. " Now you are united, nothing- can blight your success, no-
</p>
<p>" thing can prevent you, save either your own timidity, your own
</p>
<p>" treachery, or your own wavering. Are you ready to desert your
</p>
<p>"leader, and sell your country? [' Never, never.'] Then if you
</p>
<p>" are not, and I know you are not, I shall only remark, there are two
</p>
<p>" ways that present themselves to you ; one brings you to slavery,
</p>
<p>" the other conducts you to happiness and victory. If you select the
</p>
<p>" first, by cringing and flattery, and licking the hand that smites you,
</p>
<p>" you may prolong a wretched existence for a few more years :
</p>
<p>'* ' Like the lamb that's doom'd to bleed to-day,
</p>
<p>Had he thy reason would he frisk and play,
</p>
<p>And skip about  enjoy his merry mood,
</p>
<p>And lick the hand that's raised to shed his blood ?'
</p>
<p>" If you prefer the latter  honour, glory, your country, your children,
</p>
<p>" and generations unborn will bless you. Mr. Chairman, in the name
</p>
<p>" of the country I am from, and particularly of my own parish, Clon-
</p>
<p>" tibret, where a hundred fights were fought, permit me to hand you,
</p>
<p>li in the name of that parish, in the name of that people, the children
</p>
<p>" of the men that fought the battle of victory, unassisted from any
</p>
<p>" other locality, but being of the North, and of that county alone,
</p>
<p>" permit me in their names, and in my own, to have the honour of
</p>
<p>" handing to you ninety-two pounds."
</p>
<p>To this Mr. O'Connell pays the compliment of a speech: "I
</p>
<p>" think this very highly respectable clergyman deserves tbe warmest
</p>
<p>" thanks of the Association, and the sentiments he has uttered, full
</p>
<p>" of manliness, of truth, of beauty, and of patriotism." Recollect
</p>
<p>what they were  a history of those murders and those cruelties.
</p>
<p>" He has spoken of the faults we might commit, one only he has

<p>" omitted, and that is in over-impatience, over-impetuosity ; we
</p>
<p>" go slow but sure. I never heard a speech with more pleasure. I
</p>
<p>" am sure nothing could delight us more than this contribution
</p>
<p>"from the neighbourhood of Benburb. It is a very good place to
</p>
<p>" originate anything useful to Ireland. I move that the thanks of
</p>
<p>" the Association be respectfully given to the Rev. Mr. Tierney, for
</p>
<p>" his communication and eloquent discourse, by acclamation." And
</p>
<p>the proposition was carried accordingly. He then entered the Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation as a member; he was received with acclamation, and that
</p>
<p>which he had been detailing to them was adopted by them, and re-
</p>
<p>ceived with unbounded applause. Did he, or did he not, then adopt
</p>
<p>the objects and views of that Association with Mr. O'Connell and the
</p>
<p>other members now accused with him? Was, or wa3 not, his speech,
</p>
<p>then delivered, a speech for the purpose of making a public commu-
</p>
<p>nication of the treachery, and cruelty, and barbarity of England be-
</p>
<p>872
</p>
<p>tween two and three hundred years ago? Is that, or is it not, in
</p>
<p>unison with the speeches made by Mr. O'Connell himself, giving- the
</p>
<p>detail of the murders and massacres of Mullaghmast ? Is it, or is it
</p>
<p>not, in unison, and tending to the same end, with the detail of the
</p>
<p>murders committed by the same persons, butdetailed in the language
</p>
<p>of Mr. Barrett ? Is it, or is it not, with a community of purpose, in
</p>
<p>furtherance of the same endand design as the story told of the three
</p>
<p>hundred Wexford ladies who were murdered in the Bull Ring- of
</p>
<p>Wexford  the story that was detailed to hundreds of thousands at
</p>
<p>the meeting at Tara, the greatest meeting but one they ever had, or
</p>
<p>repeated at the meeting at Mallow, the same facts, though perhaps
</p>
<p>dressed in different words ? Do you see here anything of community
</p>
<p>of purpose or design ? It is for you, Gentlemen, to say whether,
</p>
<p>under those circumstances, you think the Rev. Mr. Tierney is a par-
</p>
<p>ticipator in this common design, and whether he has embraced that
</p>
<p>Association, and undertaken to carry out the same designs hy the
</p>
<p>same means.
</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen, I have gone through all the traversers, with
</p>
<p>the exception of Mr. Duffy. I shall have a little more to say upon
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett hereafter ; but in this statement of what took place at
</p>
<p>Mullaghmast, and at the Association meeting two days afterwards,
</p>
<p>I have more or less in my observations included and touched upon
</p>
<p>all the traversers, Mr. Duffy excepted. It is not denied that
</p>
<p>Mr. Duffy was a member of the Association ; it is proved indeed
</p>
<p>by various documents, and not attempted to be denied, that Mr.
</p>
<p>Duffy was the proprietor of the Nation newspaper, and that that
</p>
<p>was one of the papers which more or less was in connexion with the
</p>
<p>Association. He is accused of having entered into that common
</p>
<p>conspiracy so often detailed to you ; and though he is not proved to
</p>
<p>have attended any of those great meetings, yet there are documents
</p>
<p>brought in evidence against him, for the purpose of showing the part
</p>
<p>he was taking in what is alleged to be, the common plan of these
</p>
<p>alleged conspirators. Mr. Duffy, in his newspaper of the 29th of

</p>
<p>April, 1843 (for you will observe that all these acts of alleged crimi-
</p>
<p>nality, one and all, bear date, or begin, somewhere about the com-
</p>
<p>mencement of the year 1843), has those articles, " Something is
</p>
<p>coming," and " Our Nationality." [His Lordship here read the
</p>
<p>articles, which have been already set out, ante, pp. 71  74 ; and also
</p>
<p>an article in the Nation of the 12th of August, stated ante, p. 98.]
</p>
<p>Do you think, Gentlemen, or do you not, that upon these docu-
</p>
<p>ments Mr. Duffy was a party to the general confederacy, while other
</p>
<p>documents and other speeches afforded evidence to implicate the other
</p>
<p>traversers ? There is another document still of Mr. Duffy's, to which
</p>
<p>I shall also refer, as being of a piece in its tone and sentiments with
</p>
<p>that already stated to you, but going perhaps a little bolder, and a
</p>
<p>little farther, in what it professes : " The Crisis is upon us." This
</p>
<p>is dated the 26th of August. [See ante, p. 108.]
</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen, having read those four publications of Mr. Duf-
</p>
<p>fy, 1 have one or two to read from Mr. Barrett ; and you will judge
</p>
<p>873
</p>
<p>whether or not they have a bearing- to implicate Mr. Barrett in the
</p>
<p>charge of alleged conspiracy, for the purposes which are stated in the
</p>
<p>indictment, or any of them. This one has some reference to the
</p>
<p>army. It is dated the 6th of September, and it is entitled, " The
</p>
<p>Irish in the English Army." They are all publications following di-
</p>
<p>rectly after those immense meetings which took place from time to
</p>
<p>time all over the country, at all of which Mr. O'Connell was, and at
</p>
<p>many of which several of the other parties were present. " The Irish
</p>
<p>in the English Army  Mr. O'Callaghan's Letters." Mind, Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, that Mr. O'Callaghan is the author of " The Green Book,"
</p>
<p>and the gentleman who was selected to give the explanation, to all
</p>
<p>persons interested, of the green card, or the Members' card of the
</p>
<p>Association. "The Irish in the English Army  Mr. O'Callaghan's
</p>
<p>Letters." [See ante, p. 1 19.]
</p>
<p>There is a further publication, which is of the same tendency,
</p>
<p>publishedby Mr. Barrett on the 25th of September, and it is called
</p>
<p>" The Army, the People, and the Government." It is a long publi-
</p>
<p>cation ; I do not think it necessary to give you the trouble of hearing
</p>
<p>me read it ; you have heard it read already, and it is very much upon
</p>
<p>the same topics that are, on a smaller scale, contained in the Pilot of
</p>
<p>the 6th of September, called "The Irish in the English Army," which
</p>
<p>I have just read to you. There is another publication, which has
</p>
<p>been also read to you, and dwelt upon at much length by the officers
</p>
<p>for the Crown, also connected with the subject of the army  I mean
</p>
<p>the letter published by Mr. Barrett, in the Pilot, and bears the sig-
</p>
<p>nature of the Rev. Mr. Power, Parish Priest of Kilrossenty, in the
</p>
<p>county of Waterford, who, it was said, would have been produced here
</p>
<p>to-day. On his non-production, no comment has been offered by the
</p>
<p>officer of the Crown ; nor do I make any.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, that long letter of morality, or divinity, or whatever it
</p>
<p>may be, bears the signature of the Rev. Mr. Power, and contains full
</p>
<p>directions as to what might be, or ought to be the duties of a soldier.
</p>
<p>There are three several publications by Mr. Barrett, one and all con-
</p>

</p>
<p>nected with the same subject  the arm}'  upon the duties of a sol-
</p>
<p>dier, leaving it in the breast of every private soldier to determine whe-
</p>
<p>ther it is his duty or not, when called upon by his superior officer, to
</p>
<p>obey his commands. That is " the morality of war," us stated by the
</p>
<p>Rev. Mr. Power, and published by Mr. Barrett. And it is for you
</p>
<p>to consider whether or not these publications, with reference to the
</p>
<p>army, were or were not published by this alleged conspirator with the
</p>
<p>view of neutralizing the Queen's army, in case they should happen to
</p>
<p>be called upon in aid and assistance of the Government, in the repress-
</p>
<p>ing and keeping down whatever tumultuary uprisings might take place,
</p>
<p>growing out, perhaps, of those public demonstrations. I need not tell
</p>
<p>you, Gentlemen of the Jury, that an attempt so to interfere with the
</p>
<p>soldiery, to tamper with them, is a very high offence in law. There
</p>
<p>are Acts of Parliament which have been referred to, passed from time
</p>
<p>to time to prohibit and to prevent, under severe penalties, the daring-
</p>
<p>attempt of any person or persons who should presume to do so ; and,
</p>
<p>5T
</p>
<p>874
</p>
<p>although no evidence is given here that any of those publications did
</p>
<p>ever come to the hands of the soldiers, yet I take leave to say to you,
</p>
<p>that if you be satisfied that the traversers here, or any of them, did
</p>
<p>agree and combine together for the purpose of tampering with the mi-
</p>
<p>litary, that though, in point of fact, that object was never carried into
</p>
<p>execution, if you be satis6ed that such a conspiracy was entered into
</p>
<p>by those individuals, the crime is complete. The crime does not con-
</p>
<p>sist in the success, but in the existence of a criminal intention, in
</p>
<p>which two or more combine to carry out the common design. The
</p>
<p>paper reaching the hands of a soldier, would be an overt act of the
</p>
<p>parties who acted on that criminal concert; but the crime would not
</p>
<p>consist in the paper being delivered to the hands of the soldier, but
</p>
<p>in the criminal conspiracy which the parties had entered into for the
</p>
<p>purpose of effectuating that crime, whether it was completed, or whe-
</p>
<p>ther it was not. Therefore, with regard to the charge of a criminal
</p>
<p>conspiracy thus to interfere with the soldiers, it will be for you to say
</p>
<p>whether a conspiracy has been entered into by the persons at present
</p>
<p>charged with that crime, or by any, and which of them ; whether
</p>
<p>there was an agreement or common design entered into with that ob-
</p>
<p>ject, is the criminal charge you will have to decide.
</p>
<p>Now I think from what I have stated to you, you must all see
</p>
<p>that there is evidence before you which will include in the charge of
</p>
<p>conspiracy all the several traversers who are on their trial, if you
</p>
<p>believe the fact of the existence of a common criminal design, with
</p>
<p>the intent of effectuating the common criminal intents which are
</p>
<p>stated upon the face of the indictment; and it will not be necessary
</p>
<p>for you to come to an opinion that one and all should be guilty of
</p>
<p>one and all of the crimes and the criminal intentions set out on the
</p>
<p>face of the indictment. You all know that in point of fact there are
</p>
<p>five of these criminal intentions, for the effectuating of which the
</p>
<p>criminal conspiracy is alleged by this indictment to have been en-
</p>
<p>tered into by the traversers. It is not necessary that all should be
</p>
<p>implicated in the same criminal end ; one may be guilty and con-

</p>
<p>victed, or two may be guilty and convicted, of the criminal intention
</p>
<p>of conspiring with regard to the army; one or more may be guilty
</p>
<p>of conspiring with a criminal intention of intending to excite one
</p>
<p>portion of Her Majesty's subjects against the other, and rendering
</p>
<p>them discontented with the constitution and laws of the country as
</p>
<p>they exist ; another set, or one and all, may be guilty of the crimi-
</p>
<p>nal intent of combining for the purpose of collecting large bodies of
</p>
<p>men in different parts of Ireland, for the purpose thereby of intimi-
</p>
<p>dating and overawing the Legislature and Government of the coun-
</p>
<p>try ; another set may be guilty of a criminal conspiracy to bring into
</p>
<p>disrepute the Courts of Justice as by law established under her Ma-
</p>
<p>jesty, and inducing the subjects of this country to have their dis-
</p>
<p>putes referred for decision to other tribunals than those Courts. Now,
</p>
<p>it may be. Gentlemen of the Jury, that one and all of these several
</p>
<p>charges of criminality may, in your apprehension, have been brought
</p>
<p>home in evidence against the several traversers, one and all of them,
</p>
<p>875
</p>
<p>of against such of them as you may be of opinion the common cri-
</p>
<p>minal design is proved against ; bearing, however, in mind, that no
</p>
<p>conspiracy is proved into which more than one does not enter.
</p>
<p>Before, however, I put the case finally to you, I have another
</p>
<p>document yet to read, which, I think, is of too much importance to
</p>
<p>be omitted ; and I have something to say in conclusion with regard
</p>
<p>to the particular charge in the indictment as to the erection of the
</p>
<p>Arbitration Courts, with a view to disparage and to bring into disre-
</p>
<p>pute the established tribunals of the country. The document to
</p>
<p>which I refer was issued by the Association on the 13th of Septem-
</p>
<p>ber, 1843. It professes to be "An Address from the Loyal National
</p>
<p>" Repeal Association of Ireland to the Inhabitants of the Countries
</p>
<p>" subject to the British Crown." It is not an address to the Crown.
</p>
<p>It is not an address to the Commons  it is not a petition of any
</p>
<p>kind ; but it is an address by this body, the constitution and nature
</p>
<p>of which you are acquainted with, " to the inhabitants of the coun-
</p>
<p>" tries subject to the British Crown." It begins  (see p. 168).
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, there is one subject in particular which requires a little
</p>
<p>more detail ; I mean the Arbitration Courts. You will observe, Gentle-
</p>
<p>men of the Jury, that the charge is not simply for combining together
</p>
<p>to erect and constitute these Arbitration Courts, but the main and
</p>
<p>principal part of the charge is this  combining together for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of bringing into disrepute and discredit the existing Courts of
</p>
<p>Justice in the country, as by law established. There was a great deal
</p>
<p>of argument, and a good deal, I think, of unnecessary statement with
</p>
<p>regard to the subject of arbitration. It was said with a great deal
</p>
<p>of vehemence, and sincerity, I have no doubt, that the termination of
</p>
<p>suits by arbitration was not only no crime, but laudable as a leligious
</p>
<p>and a moral duty ; and it was said to be the universal practice of the
</p>
<p>Society of Friends or Quakers, who, it was stated, and most de-
</p>
<p>servedly, were amongst the most moral and properly conducted sub-
</p>
<p>jects that belong to the British Crown. By the rule of the Society of
</p>
<p>Friends, any member who had a dispute with another person, was

</p>
<p>bound, in the first instance, to endeavour to have that question de-
</p>
<p>cided by arbitration, before he was at liberty to take proceedings at
</p>
<p>law ; and, moreover, that the rule of the Society was enforced by
</p>
<p>another, by which any member of the Society of Friends, who should
</p>
<p>decline to terminate his suit by arbitration before he went to law, was
</p>
<p>to be expelled, or " read out of meeting," as it is called by the So-
</p>
<p>ciety. A further instance was referred to, as showing another body
</p>
<p>of people of high consideration in the country, who were in the con-
</p>
<p>stant habit of referring their disputes to arbitration, and who had ex-
</p>
<p>isting in the city of Dublin, a committee of mercantile men, consist-
</p>
<p>ing of forty of the principal merchants, called the Ouzel Galley Club,
</p>
<p>for the purpose of determining, by arbitration, the several disputes
</p>
<p>and diffe ences between any persons who should think proper to sub-
</p>
<p>mit to their decision. That is all correct, and in that way a great
</p>
<p>variety of mercantile questions in the city of Dublin are in the habit
</p>
<p>of being referred to the arbitration and final decision of the members
</p>
<p>876
</p>
<p>of the Ouzel Galley Club. But the system of arbitration adopted by
</p>
<p>the Ouzel Galley Club is not analogous to what is now proposed ; be-
</p>
<p>cause the Ouzel Galley Club, though it does take upon itself to
</p>
<p>decide the disputes and differences of those who think proper to refer
</p>
<p>to the decision of its members, is based, in the first instance, on a
</p>
<p>writ issuing out of the superior Courts, and it derives therefore its
</p>
<p>judicial authority in fact from thence; it was so stated by Mr. Cos-
</p>
<p>grave  or else the submission to arbitration is made a rule of the
</p>
<p>Court ; in either case it remains subordinate to the superior Courts.
</p>
<p>But, Gentlemen, it is stated further, that this decision of disputes
</p>
<p>by arbitration is desirable upon a conscientious and religious prin-
</p>
<p>ciple, viz. :  the putting a stop to the administering of oaths, which,
</p>
<p>before the law substituting a declaration for an oath, did exist to an
</p>
<p>extent verymuch to be regretted, particularly in cases in which the
</p>
<p>revenue was concerned. Those are all very plausible arguments to be
</p>
<p>brought forward now, and those are plausible examples to be set up as
</p>
<p>being the precedents, and the foundation upon which the present Ar-
</p>
<p>bitration Courts were established by the Association.
</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen, if the Association had acted really a bond fide
</p>
<p>part ; if any of those reasons- which are now put forward during this
</p>
<p>trial for the purpose of giving countenance to the establishment of
</p>
<p>these courts, were bond fide, there might be something in it ; but it
</p>
<p>will be for you to decide whether or not any such intention existed
</p>
<p>in the minds of the persons by whom those Arbitration Courts
</p>
<p>were invented, or whether they were set up for an entirely different
</p>
<p>purpose, with something of a factious view of opposing the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment, in the course they had taken, by dismissing from the commis-
</p>
<p>sion of the peace the magistrates who had attended several Repeal
</p>
<p>meetings. Gentlemen, I have already stated the speeches of Dr.
</p>
<p>Gray, who seems to have been, in a great measure, with Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell, the author of this system ; and see whether in any of their state-
</p>
<p>ments there is the slightest allusion, with regard to the setting up of the
</p>
<p>Arbitration Courts, to the abolition or diminution of oaths, or any

</p>
<p>such purpose. On the contrary, is there not evidence, which you
</p>
<p>have heard read to you, from which you have the materials, if you
</p>
<p>think right, to infer a very different reason for the establishment of
</p>
<p>those Arbitration Courts ; to wit, in order to enable Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell and the Association to put down the existing Courts of Jus-
</p>
<p>tice in the country, and to substitute in lieu of them, Courts, to
</p>
<p>be called Courts of Arbitration, to which the people might, if they
</p>
<p>thought proper, submit their differences, and which were to be,
</p>
<p>as Mr. O'Connell said, "the foundation of a system of justice
</p>
<p>and judicature in the country." Gentlemen, recollect in that ad-
</p>
<p>dress which I have just read from the Association, one of the
</p>
<p>grievances which is proclaimed to the world at large, as far as
</p>
<p>the British subjects are concerned, is, that persons have been ap-
</p>
<p>pointed to the Bench hostile to, or not having a feeling with the
</p>
<p>people of the country, and therefore they are dissatisfied with those
</p>
<p>Courts as they exist, and the mode in which the administration of
</p>
<p>877
</p>
<p>justice is dispensed in them. Now, if people combine in order to
</p>
<p>put down the existing Courts of Justice as derived from the appoint-
</p>
<p>ment of the Queen, and to set them at nought, and to disparage and
</p>
<p>defame them, and thereby to induce the subjects of the kingdom to
</p>
<p>withdraw from their cognizance the administration of justice, if that
</p>
<p>be their object, and further to carry that out, to establish Courts of
</p>
<p>Arbitration, to be appointed in lieu of the Queen's Courts, then,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, such an association or confederacy, for such
</p>
<p>a purpose, and with such an intent, is a violation of the law ; and any
</p>
<p>infringement or encroachment on the Queen's prerogative, in that re-
</p>
<p>spect, has always been considered a high misdemeanor.
</p>
<p>The subject, Gentlemen, is treated briefly and clearly by Judge
</p>
<p>Blackstone, in his celebrated Commentaries on the Law of England ;
</p>
<p>and in his first volume, page 267, he thus states, in respect of it 
</p>
<p>" Another capacity in which the King is considered in domestic
</p>
<p>" affairs, is as the fountain of justice and general conservator of the
</p>
<p>" peace of the kingdom. By the fountain of justice the law does not
</p>
<p>" mean the author or original, but only the distributor. Justice is
</p>
<p>" not derived from the King, as from his free gift, but he is the
</p>
<p>" steward of the public, to dispense it to whom it is due. He is not
</p>
<p>" the spring, but the reservoir, from whence right and equity are
</p>
<p>" conducted, by a thousand channels, to every individual. The ori-
</p>
<p>" ginal power of judicature, by the fundamental principles of society,
</p>
<p>" is lodged in society at large ; but as it would be impracticable
</p>
<p>" to render complete justice to every individual, by the people in their
</p>
<p>" collective capacity, therefore every nation has committed that
</p>
<p>" power to certain select magistrates, who, with more ease and ex-
</p>
<p>" pedition, can hear and determine complaints; and in England this
</p>
<p>" authority has immemorially been exercised by the King, or his
</p>
<p>" substitutes. He, therefore, has alone the right of erecting Courts
</p>
<p>" of judicature; for though the Constitution of the kingdom hath
</p>
<p>" intrusted him with the whole executive power of the laws, it is
</p>
<p>" impossible, as well as improper, that he should personally carry

</p>
<p>"into execution this great and extensive trust ; it is consequently
</p>
<p>" necessary that Courts should be erected to assist him in execu-
</p>
<p>" ting this power; and equally necessary, that if erected, they should
</p>
<p>" be erected by his authority. And hence it is, that all jurisdictions
</p>
<p>" of Courts are either mediately or immediately derived from the
</p>
<p>" Crown ; their proceedings run generally in the King's name ; they
</p>
<p>" pass under his seal, and are executed by his officers." Such is
</p>
<p>the common law of this country ; and it is therefore an infringement
</p>
<p>and a violation of that law, if two or more persons presume and take
</p>
<p>upon them to enter into a common design to detract from the respect
</p>
<p>due to the Queen's Courts of Justice, and in the way in which the law-
</p>
<p>is administered in those Courts. If any person has a grievance with
</p>
<p>regard to the manner in which his cause is treated in any of the
</p>
<p>Queen's Courts, he has his remedy. The law is open to him, and
</p>
<p>there is a tribunal of dernier resort, vested for the most part in the
</p>
<p>House of Lords. But to attempt to deny the power of the Crown to
</p>
<p>erect those Courts, or to detract from the character or the moile of
</p>
<p>administration of justice in those Courts, is a direct offence of a very
</p>
<p>high nature, and a direct infringement of that privilege of the Crown
</p>
<p>that has subsisted at all times, as I have read to you, in the kingdom
</p>
<p>of Great Biitain and its dependencies.
</p>
<p>Therefore, it is something - to be considered, what has taken
</p>
<p>place, and the manner in which these Arbitration Courts, and the
</p>
<p>principle of arbitration was carried out. I hold in my hand a
</p>
<p>Report of the Arbitration Committee, presented to the Associa-
</p>
<p>tion, and dated the 21st of August, 1843. It was brought for-
</p>
<p>ward again in the Repeal Association on Wednesday, the 23rd of
</p>
<p>August, 1843, and was adopted, being moved by Dr. Gray, and se-
</p>
<p>conded by Mr. O'Hea, and carried unanimously. You will find in
</p>
<p>this Report a statement of the system that had been proposed by Dr.
</p>
<p>Gray, submitted to the Association, and by them carried into one of
</p>
<p>its laws. It is a Report of a new system of judicature to be erected,
</p>
<p>not for any particular case, not for any particular district, but to be
</p>
<p>recommended and intended to be adopted for the entire kingdom, so
</p>
<p>that in every part the Courts erected under this recommendation,
</p>
<p>which are the Association Courts, are intended to be in substitution
</p>
<p>of the Queen's Courts, which are not considered by Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>as longer dispensing justice to the subjects of the kingdom. And
</p>
<p>recollect, Gentlemen, the offence contained in the indictment with
</p>
<p>regard to these Courts, is not an attempt to establish Arbitration
</p>
<p>Courts, though perhaps that might (I do not say whether it would
</p>
<p>or would not) be an offence, or anything criminal, for parties to con-
</p>
<p>spire to do so ; but the offence charged is  which I take to be clearly
</p>
<p>criminal  a combination to bring into disparagement and disrepute
</p>
<p>the Courts of Judicature as existing by law in the country, to bring
</p>
<p>them into contempt and disregard amongst the subjects of Her Ma-
</p>
<p>jesty, and to induce them to go to other tribunals for the purpose of
</p>
<p>terminating their disputes.
</p>
<p>That the parties did take measures to that effect, I have al-
</p>
<p>ready stated to you, by the reading in most unequivocal language
</p>

</p>
<p>the charge against the existing Courts, as contained in that gene-
</p>
<p>ral address from the Association, which was printed on a broad
</p>
<p>sheet, and circulated throughout the country. I have read to you,
</p>
<p>in addition to that, the statement made by Mr. O'Connell at the
</p>
<p>great meeting at Clifden, after the dinner, as to the erection of these
</p>
<p>Arbitration Courts; thereby, as he says himself, laying the founda-
</p>
<p>tion of new Courts in which justice may be looked for and administered.
</p>
<p>To the same effect was the speech delivered by Dr. Gray at Mullagh-
</p>
<p>mast. To the same effect was the statement made by Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>in his speeches at Mullaghmast. And here we have a paper adopted
</p>
<p>by the Association, being the report of the Arbitration Committee,
</p>
<p>dated in August, 1843; its adoption was moved by Dr. Gray, and
</p>
<p>seconded by Mr. O'Hea, and carried unanimously. And here are
</p>
<p>the reasons for the recommendation of the adoption of this new sys-
</p>
<p>tem of Arbitration Courts. " Your Committee are of opinion, that,
</p>
<p>879
</p>
<p>" inasmuch as many of the magistrates who possess popular confidence
</p>
<p>" have been deprived of the commission of the peace, because of their
</p>
<p>" attachment to the cause of legislative independence, no unneces-
</p>
<p>" sary time should be lost in carrying into practice the principle of
</p>
<p>" the Arbitration, as already approved of by the unanimous vote of
</p>
<p>" the Association. In order, therefore, to secure the perfect and har-
</p>
<p>" monious working of such a system, your Committee recommend
</p>
<p>" that a standing Committee be immediately formed to arrange the
</p>
<p>" necessary details, to prepare the necessary forms, and superintend
</p>
<p>" the practical working of the system after it shall have been put in
</p>
<p>" operation. Being further of opinion that the system of Arbitration
</p>
<p>" should be universally applied as the circumstances of each locality
</p>
<p>" will admit, your Committee recommend, that for that purpose the
</p>
<p>" several counties be appointed into districts.'' It is intended to be a
</p>
<p>general system. Then it speaks of the persons to whom a preference
</p>
<p>should be given in the appointment of Arbitrators. " Your Commit-
</p>
<p>" tee suggest, that the dismissed magistrates, and such Repeal jus-
</p>
<p>" tices as have resigned, be in the first instance recommended as Ar-
</p>
<p>" bitrators in their respective districts, and that a dismissed magistrate,
</p>
<p>" or one who has resigned, if present, be in all cases chosen as the
</p>
<p>" chairman of the Court of Arbitrators." Not on account of his legal
</p>
<p>knowledge, local or other information, or property, but, as a matter
</p>
<p>of course, either because he has been dismissed as a magistrate for
</p>
<p>attending Repeal meetings, or because he has thought proper to re-
</p>
<p>sign ; therefore, for no other reason, that person is to be appointed
</p>
<p>chairman of the district. Now that is the only reason assigned on
</p>
<p>the face of this Report, for the necessity or advisability of the substi-
</p>
<p>tution of these Courts. It is not based on the principle of reli-
</p>
<p>gion, charity, or benevolence, and the matter recommended was,
</p>
<p>that without loss of time the persons who had been dismissed from
</p>
<p>office, or resigned their office as magistrates, for the reason assigned,
</p>
<p>should be at once placed in these Arbitration Courts, and at their
</p>
<p>head. Is that a reason, Gentlemen, why the parties in question

</p>
<p>have thought proper, upon several occasions, in several places, and
</p>
<p>with the utmost publicity, to disparage and decry the Courts of Jus-
</p>
<p>tice, that Her Majesty, under her letters patent, has thought proper
</p>
<p>to provide, in the execution of her undoubted prerogative, as Courts
</p>
<p>of law for the benefit and protection of her subjects? Her Judges
</p>
<p>in those Courts have the great advantage, that they are bv law alto-
</p>
<p>gether independent both of the Crown and of the subject. They are
</p>
<p>placed here to administer the laws of the land, for which they have
</p>
<p>been all duly educated, for the discharge of those duties, to which it
</p>
<p>is to be presumed they are competent, and for the discharge of which
</p>
<p>Her Majesty, by her letters patent, has thought proper to appoint
</p>
<p>them. The administration of the law is, in the (it is to be hoped)
</p>
<p>partial view that Mr. O'Connell takes of it, to be withdrawn from
</p>
<p>them who are not worthy to continue in the administration of it, and
</p>
<p>it is to be placed in the hands of persons who, for aught that appears,
</p>
<p>never received any education on any subject connected with the laws
</p>
<p>880
</p>
<p>of the land. 1 do not, however, draw a comparison ; it is not for me
</p>
<p>to do so; the law has already done it for me; they are the Judges
</p>
<p>whom the Queen has thought proper to place upon the benches of
</p>
<p>her superior Courts, in execution of her duties to the subject, and in
</p>
<p>the exercise of her undoubted prerogative. People, if they choose,
</p>
<p>if they think it for their advantage, may of course refer their dis-
</p>
<p>putes to arbitration ; and in very many cases I am persuaded they
</p>
<p>could not adopt a wiser course, or a better plan for having their
</p>
<p>cases properly decided, and for having them decided at a great
</p>
<p>saving of expense. But, Gentlemen, was that the reason that
</p>
<p>those Arbitration Courts were appointed? Composed of indivi-
</p>
<p>duals not known to the party, not chosen by the party, but
</p>
<p>chosen by the Association, who think proper to assume to them-
</p>
<p>selves the right and power which belongs alone to the Queen's pre-
</p>
<p>rogative. If you think that those aspersions on Courts of Justice
</p>
<p>were cast by the traversers, or any or either of them, with a view of
</p>
<p>bringing those Courts, and the administration of justice in them, into
</p>
<p>contempt and disrepute, and to withdraw the confidence which the
</p>
<p>subjects otherwise would have in them ; if the traversers, or any, or
</p>
<p>either of them, have conspired for the purpose of raising that feeling
</p>
<p>towards those Courts, and if they have done so with a common design,
</p>
<p>then, Gentlemen, I have to tell you, that that is a high misdemeanor,
</p>
<p>is highly illegal, and if they conspired to do so, those who have so
</p>
<p>conspired, that is, agreed to bring it about by combination, are guilty
</p>
<p>of the crime of conspiracy imputed to them in that respect.
</p>
<p>There are four other grounds of conspiracy alleged against
</p>
<p>the traversers in the present indictment. I will put to you in
</p>
<p>writing again, what I did before with regard to them. They
</p>
<p>are indicted, the eight traversers  and you are to pronounce, by
</p>
<p>your deliberate, conscientious verdict, whether they, or any, and
</p>
<p>which of them, did conspire and agree to raise and create dis-
</p>
<p>content and disaffection amongst the Queen's subjecis, and hatred
</p>
<p>and unlawful opposition to the Government and Constitution. Se-

<p>condly, whether they conspired and agreed, or any, and which of
</p>
<p>them, to stir up jealousies amongst the Queen's subjects, and to pro-
</p>
<p>mote ill-will and hostility to other of her subjects, especially the Irish
</p>
<p>against the English. Thirdly, whether they conspired and agreed or
</p>
<p>any, and which of them, to excite disaffection in the army. Fourthly,
</p>
<p>whether they conspired and agreed to collect unlawful assemblies in
</p>
<p>large numbers in Ireland in order to obtain changes in the law and
</p>
<p>Constitution, by intimidation and demonstration of physical force.
</p>
<p>And lastly, whether they, or any, and which of them, conspired and
</p>
<p>agreed to bring the Courts of Judicature established by law into dis-
</p>
<p>repute, with intent to induce the subjects of the Crown to submit
</p>
<p>their disputes to other tribunals.
</p>
<p>If you are of opinion that the traversers, or any of them, con-
</p>
<p>spired and agreed to do, or cause to be done, the said several matters,
</p>
<p>or any of them, then you are to find such traverser or traversers
</p>
<p>guilty of the fact of conspiracy so laid.
</p>
<p>881
</p>
<p>I have put the questions to you in the language of the indictment*
</p>
<p>It lies upon the Crown to establish  they have undertaken to do so
</p>
<p> that the traversers, or some of them, are guilty of a conspiracy
</p>
<p>such as I have already stated to you  a conspiracy consisting of five
</p>
<p>branches, any one of which being brought home, to your satisfaction,
</p>
<p>to the traversers, or traverser, in the way imputed, will maintain and
</p>
<p>establish the charge which the Crown has undertaken to prove.
</p>
<p>But, Gentlemen of the Jury, you are never to lose sight of this
</p>
<p>fact ; criminality or crime is a thing that must be proved, and is not to
</p>
<p>be merely surmised. Every person, by the law of this country, is
</p>
<p>entitled to have the benefit of being deemed innocent until he is
</p>
<p>proved guilty.
</p>
<p>The traversers have one and all of them made the defence, that
</p>
<p>their designs were not criminal ; that they had grievances; that they
</p>
<p>had a right to complain of those grievances; that they had a right to
</p>
<p>lay them before the public, though it happened in so doing they at-
</p>
<p>tended multitudinous meetings. If you should be of opinion, that
</p>
<p>such were the designs and objects of the traversers, and that they
</p>
<p>had no such criminal intent as imputed, and did not resort to any
</p>
<p>criminal means for the furtherance of those objects ; if that should
</p>
<p>be your opinion, you would be bound to acquit the traversers, or any
</p>
<p>such, as you should conceive to stand in that innocent situation.
</p>
<p>That is to say, you would be bound to acquit them, so far as
</p>
<p>their case consisted merely of intention. But if, on the other
</p>
<p>hand, you should be of opinion that those were not the real objects of
</p>
<p>the persons charged as traversers, whatever their apparent designs
</p>
<p>may be, and however they might be masked, that they had in fact,
</p>
<p>and in truth, the criminal intentions which are attributed to them by
</p>
<p>the Crown ; and if you be satisfied further, that the traversers, or
</p>
<p>some of them, in furtherance of those designs, acted with a common,
</p>
<p>criminal object, and in a common, criminal concert, then in such case
</p>
<p>you will be bound, conscientiously, to find them guilty of the conspi-
</p>
<p>racy which you shall be satisfied is so proved against them, and in

<p>which they shall appear to have been participators.
</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen of the Jury, a great deal has been addressed to
</p>
<p>you in various ways and on various grounds, which I do not intend to
</p>
<p>recapitulate. You have been pressed by arguments appealing to your
</p>
<p>feelings  I would say appealing sometimes to your apprehensions;
</p>
<p>you have been addressed by gentlemen of the greatest ability, I be-
</p>
<p>lieve in greater number than persons accused of crime ever had before
</p>
<p>the opportunity of having heard on their behalf. Every topic that
</p>
<p>could be suggested by ingenuity and reasoning has been made use of.
</p>
<p>But, Gentlemen, it has been thrown out to you that there were other
</p>
<p>grounds besides the evidence that has been laid before you, which you
</p>
<p>might legitimately and properly take into your consideration, in com-
</p>
<p>ing to your conclusion upon the verdict that you should give. In an-
</p>
<p>swer to that, Gentlemen, I have only to state, you are by law consi-
</p>
<p>dered to be indifferent between the parties, indifferent as you stand
</p>
<p>unsworn, indifferent after you are sworn, biassed and swayed by no-
</p>
<p>5u
</p>
<p>882
</p>
<p>thing but the oath which you have taken  which is to give a verdict
</p>
<p>according to the evidence. That is your oath ; to enable you to do
</p>
<p>that, I must say I never saw a Jury who, during a long and painful
</p>
<p>trial, extending over more than three weeks, have paid such undeviat-
</p>
<p>ing attention to the case and evidence that has been laid before them
</p>
<p>as you have, and to the several gentlemen that have addressed you oa
</p>
<p>either side. I feel confident, therefore, that in the conclusion which
</p>
<p>you shall draw, you will give a verdict founded upon the evidence,
</p>
<p>conformable to the dictates of your reason and of your conscience;
</p>
<p>and I do trust that the Lord, who rules over all, will enlighten and
</p>
<p>direct you.
</p>
<p>The Foreman of the Jury stated the jury were much fatigued,
</p>
<p>and wished to know whether it would be necessary for them to go
</p>
<p>into the consideration of the case to-night.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  Gentlemen, I am sorry to tell you
</p>
<p>it is not possible for me to allow you to separate for the night, now
</p>
<p>that the charge has been delivered. I am sorry to say I have not
</p>
<p>the power to give you the liberty of retiring to your own homes.
</p>
<p>You must remain in the custody of the Sheriff, holding no commu-
</p>
<p>nication with any but each other. I am not aware that the Court
</p>
<p>is at liberty to give any other answer to your question.
</p>
<p>The issue paper was then handed up to the jury, and they re-
</p>
<p>tired at half past five o'clock.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn.  Before your Lordships leave the Court, I submit
</p>
<p>that there is no evidence that any of the acts were done within the
</p>
<p>county of the city of Dublin.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  What do you call the meetings of
</p>
<p>the Association ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn.  There is no evidence that those meetings were held
</p>
<p>in the county of the city of Dublin.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice having left the Court,
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton took a note that there was no evidence
</p>
<p>in support of the charge, to show that the venue was properly laid

<p>in the county of the city of Dublin.
</p>
<p>Their Lordships retired, with the exception of Mr. Justice
</p>
<p>Perrin.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore, on the part of the Traversers.  lam quite satisfied
</p>
<p>that all the documents should be given to the jury, but I have been
</p>
<p>instructed that marks and scores have been made under particular
</p>
<p>parts of them, and I do not think that they should go to the jury in
</p>
<p>that state. It appears also that the Clerk of the Crown has all the
</p>
<p>documents on one side, and only a few on the other.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin.  They will be forthcoming. Mr. Vernon
</p>
<p>has got some of the newspapers. A messenger has gone for him.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn.  My Lord, I object to any of the newspapers going
</p>
<p>to the jury without our seeing them.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin then retired.
</p>
<p>883
</p>
<p>At half-past seven Mr. Justice Crampton came into Court.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General.  All the documents are now in Court;
</p>
<p>I wish to know if they are to go to the jury.
</p>
<p>Mr. Afoore.  Some of the documents are marked. If they went
</p>
<p>to the jury, the consequence would be, that their attention would be
</p>
<p>directed to that which is prejudicial, and there would be nothing to
</p>
<p>direct their attention to that which is favourable to the traversers.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton  What you say is quite reasonable,
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore, and as there is a difficulty about the matter, let the
</p>
<p>High Sheriff inform the jury that they cannot have the documents.
</p>
<p>As the jury are not coming out, the better course will be to swear
</p>
<p>in bailiffs, and to adjourn the Court until nine o'clock.
</p>
<p>Five bailiffs were sworn, and the Court adjourned.
</p>
<p>At a quarter past nine Mr. Justice Crampton returned.
</p>
<p>The Sheriff having been sent for the jury, the Foreman in a few
</p>
<p>minutes appeared, and stated that the jury were not quite ready.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  I shall wait for you: let me know
</p>
<p>when you are ready.
</p>
<p>At eleven o'clock his Lordship returned, and sent for the jury.
</p>
<p>The Foreman came into Court, and asked whether the jury were
</p>
<p>to give a verdict on every count, whether they had agreed or not
</p>
<p>agreed ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  If you are agreed upon each count,
</p>
<p>some of you have only to say, " not guilty," or " guilty," accord-
</p>
<p>ing to your verdict. If you only agree on some of the counts, you
</p>
<p>state those on which you have agreed, and the traversers with re-
</p>
<p>spect to whom you agree. But there must be a finding, one way
</p>
<p>or the other, on each count.
</p>
<p>The Foreman then retired.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  Mr. Attorney and Mr. Moore, I am
</p>
<p>disposed to think that if the jury agreed on certain counts, and not
</p>
<p>on others, I should be at liberty to receive their verdict so stated.
</p>
<p>I wish you to consider that.

</p>
<p>At twenty minutes before twelve the jury came into Court.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown called over the names of the jury.
</p>
<p>The traversers were called on their recognizances. Mr. Steele,
</p>
<p>Dr. Gray, Mr. Ray, and Mr. Barrett, appeared.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  If the traversers have appeared by
</p>
<p>attorney, we cannot require their appearance personally.
</p>
<p>The Attorney -General.  They have been called on their re-
</p>
<p>cognizances merely for form's sake, and not with a view to any
</p>
<p>ulterior proceedings.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown.  Gentlemen, are you agreed?
</p>
<p>Foreman.  Yes.
</p>
<p>The Foreman here handed the issue to the Clerk of the Crown,
</p>
<p>who proceeded to say : Gentlemen, you say nothing on the first
</p>
<p>count ; none on the second ; but, Gentlemen, on the third count
</p>
<p>you say, Daniel O'Connell, Richard Barrett, and Charles Gavan
</p>
<p>Duffy are guilty ; nothing with respect to the others.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  There is no finding on that count
</p>
<p>against the others.
</p>
<p>884
</p>
<p>Clerk of the Crown.  No.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  Then the finding is imperfect.
</p>
<p>The Foreman said the first count was too comprehensive.
</p>
<p>Clerk of the Crown.  Gentlemen, you say that on the fourth
</p>
<p>count Daniel O'Connell, John O'Connell, Thomas Matthew Ray,
</p>
<p>John Gray, Thomas Steele, Charles Gavan Duffy, and Richard
</p>
<p>Barrett, are guilty. Mr. Tierney is not included in that count.
</p>
<p>On the fifth count, Daniel O'Connell, John O'Connell, T. M. Ray,
</p>
<p>John Gray, Thomas Steele, C. Gavan Duffy, Richard Barrett, and
</p>
<p>Rev. Thomas Tierney, are guilty. No finding on the sixth count.
</p>
<p>On the seventh count, Daniel O'Connell, John O'Connell, Thomas
</p>
<p>Matthew Ray, John Gray, Thomas Steele, Richard Barrett, and
</p>
<p>Charles Gavan Duffy, guilty. No finding in this count with re-
</p>
<p>gard to Rev. Thomas Tierney. There is no finding on the eighth or
</p>
<p>ninth count ; but on the tenth count the jury have found that Da-
</p>
<p>niel O'Connell, John O'Connell, Thomas Matthew Ray, John Gray,
</p>
<p>Thomas Steele, Charles Gavan Duffy, and Richard Barrett, are
</p>
<p>guilty. On the eleventh count there is no finding, but merely the
</p>
<p>Foreman's signature for self and fellow-jurors.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  You must take your verdict back, for
</p>
<p>in the present state it is imperfect. In those counts, in respect of
</p>
<p>which you came to a conclusion as to the guilt or innocence of the
</p>
<p>traversers, it is your duty to return a verdict of guilty or not guilty,
</p>
<p>and if you cannot come to an agreement on any count or counts,
</p>
<p>you ought to say so in your verdict.
</p>
<p>The Foreman.  My Lord, we thought the first count too com-
</p>
<p>prehensive ; that it included every thing.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  The first count does embrace all,
</p>
<p>and the other counts only take the first count into pieces. You had
</p>
<p>better retire for a few moments and arrange your verdict.
</p>
<p>Mr. Floyd (one of the jurors).  Would the verdict be correct if
</p>
<p>we put not guilty in the first and second counts ?
</p>
<p>Mr. JusticeCramptun.  You should return a verdict of guilty

</p>
<p>on such parts of the first count as are identical with the other
</p>
<p>counts in respect of which you have returned a verdict of guilty,
</p>
<p>and you should return a verdict of not guilty on such portions of
</p>
<p>the first count as are identical with the other counts in respect of
</p>
<p>which you consider that the traversers are not guilty.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore.  If the jury think the traversers are not guilty on
</p>
<p>the first count, they have a right to pronounce their opinion on it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  Of course they have.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore.  And that is the question they are asking your
</p>
<p>Lordship.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  The jury do not mean to find a con-
</p>
<p>tradictory verdict ; they do not mean by a single finding on the first
</p>
<p>count to contradict their finding on the other counts. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>1 think you understand, that in reference to all these counts as to
</p>
<p>which you are agreed, that sonic of the defendants are guilty, and
</p>
<p>some not. You ought to name those who are guilty, and those who
</p>
<p>are not. It is your duty to find guilty or not guilty on every count
</p>
<p>885
</p>
<p>in respect of which you are agreed, and if there are parts of the first
</p>
<p>count on which you cannot agree, that fact ought to be mentioned
</p>
<p>also. With respect to the first count, if I understand you rightly,
</p>
<p>there are parts of that count on which you have agreed, and parts
</p>
<p>on which you have not agreed.
</p>
<p>Mr. Floyd.  The jury has no difference of opinion ; the only
</p>
<p>thing on which we have any difficulty is the exact terms in which
</p>
<p>the verdict ought to be framed.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General.  We wish your Lordship should in-
</p>
<p>form the jury that they are not bound to find on the entire of the
</p>
<p>counts, and explain that the first count embraces several branches
</p>
<p>of the conspiracy, which is split up afterwards into the others.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore.  We do not mean to offer any arguments upon the
</p>
<p>point; but on the part of the traversers we mean to object to the
</p>
<p>direction which we understood your Lordship to have given the
</p>
<p>jury, that if they should disagree upon some of the counts, that
</p>
<p>they should express that disagreement. We respectfully submit
</p>
<p>that such a verdict could not be received.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  But the jury say there is no disagree-
</p>
<p>ment.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn.  We also object to what the Attorney-General says,
</p>
<p>that it is not necessary that they should find a verdict on all the
</p>
<p>counts, but they are at liberty to find a verdict on any one of the
</p>
<p>charges, and give no finding upon the others.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crhmpton.  The jury handed in their verdict,
</p>
<p>containing a finding upon certain counts, and it remains for the
</p>
<p>Court to see whether that is a verdict that can be received at all.
</p>
<p>The jury then retired.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General.  Perhaps your Lordship is not aware
</p>
<p>that it is very close upon twelve o'clock, and the verdict cannot be
</p>
<p>received on Sunday. It may be right, therefore, to adjourn to
</p>
<p>Monday morning.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  It has not struck twelve yet. I should

</p>
<p>wish to be quite satisfied that the verdict cannot be received after
</p>
<p>twelve o'clock. I have received verdicts at two and three o'clock
</p>
<p>in the morning in capital cases, and, I believe, upon one occasion,
</p>
<p>on a Sunday morning. Let the jury be called into Court at once.
</p>
<p>The jury immediately entered their box.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton Have you now arranged your ver-
</p>
<p>dict.
</p>
<p>Foreman.  Not yet, my Lord.
</p>
<p>The jury again retired.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn.  It is now past twelve o'clock.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General.  I cannot possibly consent to the jury
</p>
<p>being allowed to separate now. I think there must be an adjourn-
</p>
<p>ment till Monday morning.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  I want to know whether you contend
</p>
<p>that the verdict is not receivable now.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General.  Under the circumstances, I think the
</p>
<p>jury should not be allowed to separate at this hour.
</p>
<p>886
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  That is a different question. I want
</p>
<p>to know whether you mean to say that the verdict is receivable.
</p>
<p>The Attorney -General.  I do not go that length, nor do I think
</p>
<p>it necessary ; but in a case of this magnitude and importance I
</p>
<p>cannot agree to have the jury discharged now.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  I only want to have it done accord-
</p>
<p>ing to law ; certainly great inconvenience may arise from keeping
</p>
<p>the jury shut up during the night, and all to-morrow, and the whole
</p>
<p>of to-morrow night, and if there is not an absolute necessity for it,
</p>
<p>it should not be resorted to. What do you say, Mr. Moore ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore.  I say nothing, my Lord.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  Very well, you do not commit your-
</p>
<p>self much by that. What do you say, Mr. Henn ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Henri.  My Lord, we do not consent to any arrangement;
</p>
<p>we have nothing to say to it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  I see that I cannot get any informa-
</p>
<p>tion or assistance from either side.
</p>
<p>The Attorney -General.  I will endeavour, as far as I can, to
</p>
<p>give information to the Court; but it happens to be a singular case,
</p>
<p>and a question might be raised as to whether your Lordship may
</p>
<p>have jurisdiction to do any act at this hour. Under those circum-
</p>
<p>stances, I do not think I could be justified in not stating that I am
</p>
<p>of opinion the Court ought to adjourn until Monday morning.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  I shall certainly not discharge the
</p>
<p>jury against the will of the counsel for the Crown and the tra-
</p>
<p>versers.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore.  We are not expressing any opinion whatever on
</p>
<p>the subject, my Lord.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  I know you are not actually doing so,
</p>
<p>but then you do not consent to it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Sheil.  We are not entering into the question at all ; the
</p>
<p>Attorney- General has taken his course, and we have nothing to say
</p>
<p>to it.

</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  Then all I can do, is to have the jury
</p>
<p>made as comfortable as possible, and I shall adjourn the Court to
</p>
<p>eight o'clock on Monday morning. I suppose that is the best ar-
</p>
<p>rangement I can make. Suppose we say nine. Call out the jury.
</p>
<p>Mr. Monahan.  My Lord, on the part of one of the traversers,
</p>
<p>I beg to object to it, as it is now after twelve o'clock on Saturday
</p>
<p>night ; and I respectfully submit that your Lordship has no power
</p>
<p>to do any judicial act now.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton  I have not my note-book here, but I
</p>
<p>shall remember your objection, Mr. Monahan, though I do not think
</p>
<p>it likely that you will hear anything more of it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton Gentlemen, I have a very unploaant
</p>
<p>communication to make to you. The hour of twelve o'clock having
</p>
<p>now arrived, I am informed by the learned counsel for (he Crown
</p>
<p>that my jurisdiction to receive your verdict is at end for this night,
</p>
<p>and until Monday morning. I am very much distressed at it ; but
</p>
<p>it has resulted from that circumstance, and you must now remain in
</p>
<p>887
</p>
<p>your jury-room, and give me your verdict on Monday morning, until
</p>
<p>which time the Court must be adjourned. This is a fatality arising
</p>
<p>out of the hour of twelve having arrived without the verdict being
</p>
<p>ready ; and you will now retire to your chamber, where I have in-
</p>
<p>structed the Sheriff to provide you with every accommodation. In-
</p>
<p>deed, he requires no instruction, for he is most anxious to do all he
</p>
<p>can to make you comfortable. There will be sleeping accommodation
</p>
<p>provided for you, and every other accommodation you may require,
</p>
<p>and the High Sheriff will, to-morrow, at a proper hour, accompany
</p>
<p>you to Divine Service, and accompany you back ; but you cannot se-
</p>
<p>parate out of his custody. You will remain in your room up to the
</p>
<p>period to attend Divine Service, if you choose to attend it ; and on
</p>
<p>Monday morning I, or some other of the Judges of this Court,
</p>
<p>will be ready to receive your verdict. I am extremely sorry to be
</p>
<p>obliged to announce this to you, but there is no alternative.
</p>
<p>Mr. Monahan.  I submit to your Lordship that you have now
</p>
<p>no power to adjourn, or to do any other official act at this hour.
</p>
<p>His Lordship received the objection, and the Court adjourned to
</p>
<p>nine o'clock on Monday morning.
</p>
<p>MONDAY, February 12.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin was absent.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  I wish to inform my learned brethren,
</p>
<p>the Lord Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Burton, of what occurred
</p>
<p>upon Saturday evening in their absence; to tell them of the Jury's
</p>
<p>having come out, and to state what passed between them and the
</p>
<p>Court. They retired, their Lordships were aware, and remained
</p>
<p>away for a considerable time in their own room; after which I had an
</p>
<p>intimation, through the Sheriff, from them, that they would not be
</p>
<p>ready with their verdict for an hour ; accordingly I adjourned the
</p>
<p>Court for an hour and a half, until nine o'clock, at which time I re-
</p>
<p>turned, and found that still they were not prepared to meet me. I
</p>
<p>remained for a considerable period in Chamber, and sent once or
</p>
<p>tw-ice to know if they were ready to come into Court with their

<p>verdict, but I heard that they were not ; however, shortly after
</p>
<p>eleven o'clock, I called them out, when they came with a verdict in
</p>
<p>their hands, which they handed in, but which I considered informal,
</p>
<p>and such as I could not receive. They seemed manifestly perplexed
</p>
<p>about the form of the issue, for the first or second counts they did
</p>
<p>not seem to understand, although they mentioned that they were en-
</p>
<p>tirely agreed among themselves as to the verdict they should give.
</p>
<p>Their difficulty was only as to a matter of form, which I endeavoured
</p>
<p>to explain, but I fear I failed to convey myself sufficiently. They
</p>
<p>again retired, and after some time the Attorney-General said he
</p>
<p>thought that I should not receive a verdict after twelve o'clock,
</p>
<p>as it was then Sunday morning ; and no consent having been given
</p>
<p>by the counsel for the traversers (if such a consent could operate);
</p>
<p>888
</p>
<p>I thought it right to adjourn the Court until this morning, having
</p>
<p>previously ordered the jury every accommodation which it was
</p>
<p>in my power to have provided under the circumstances. These
</p>
<p>were the facts of what occurred ; but I should mention that while
</p>
<p>the jury were out, I drew up in a more specific form, the issue for
</p>
<p>which they were to find their verdict. Now, I understand that there
</p>
<p>is but one issue in the first count sent to the jury, which, in point
</p>
<p>of form, is regular enough, but in point of fact it is not sufficient,
</p>
<p>as there are five distinct issues embodied in that count ; so that, ac-
</p>
<p>cording to the view which they had taken of the case, they could not
</p>
<p>find upon it at all; therefore it is necessary to divide it into five dis-
</p>
<p>tinct branches ; accordingly I occupied myself in framing those issues,
</p>
<p>and, with the consent of the Court, I will state what I consider to be
</p>
<p>the proper and specific form. [His Lordship then went through the
</p>
<p>different counts, and the issues under each count.] An objection was
</p>
<p>taken up on Saturday evening, in the absence of the other members of
</p>
<p>the Court, by Mr. Henn, to the effect that no evidence was given of
</p>
<p>the acts and proceedings laid in the indictment having taken place
</p>
<p>within the County of the City of Dublin ; which he submitted should
</p>
<p>have been proved, in order to sustain it. Mr. Monahan also made
</p>
<p>an objection, which I will inform the Court of, namely, that inasmuch
</p>
<p>as it was then (when he made the objection) Sunday morning, that
</p>
<p>the Court had no further power to proceed with the case, or do any
</p>
<p>judicial act, and that therefore the trial should lapse until the first
</p>
<p>day of Easter Term.
</p>
<p>The Deputy Clerk of the Croivn then called over the traversers,
</p>
<p>all of whom answered to their names ; and then called over the
</p>
<p>names of the jury, who were in Court. When they had all appeared,
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton informed them that he was directed by
</p>
<p>the Court to read the different findings, to guide them as to the
</p>
<p>mode in which they should sign the issue paper sent up to them.
</p>
<p>The learned Judge then read over the specified charges in the dif-
</p>
<p>ferent counts which he had previously read, and handed them to the

<p>Foreman of the jury, who stated that he believed that he and his
</p>
<p>fellow-jurors had themselves done what his lordship had suggested.
</p>
<p>The jury then at half-past nine o'clock again retired to their
</p>
<p>room, and after an absence of a quarter of an hour again came into
</p>
<p>Court.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore, Q. C, said that before the verdict was read, he
</p>
<p>wished it to appear on their Lordships' notes, that they (the counsel
</p>
<p>for the traversers) conceived there was a mis-trial, by reason of a
</p>
<p>misnomer of one of the jury, who, when called on, answered as John
</p>
<p>Jason Rigby, but who appeared on the panel as John Rigby. They
</p>
<p>contended that, under these circumstances, there was a mis-trial by
</p>
<p>reason of the misnomer.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General said that the juror had been sworn as
</p>
<p>John Rigby, the name which appeared on the panel, of which par-
</p>
<p>ticular notice had been taken at the time by the counsel for the
</p>
<p>Crown.
</p>
<p>889
</p>
<p>The Deputy Clerk of the Crown then proceeded to read the
</p>
<p>following verdict :
</p>
<p>First and Second Count.
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>Not Guilty. Reverend Thomas Tierney.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice  I suppose that there is nothing fur-
</p>
<p>ther to detain the jury.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General  There is not.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  Gentlemen, after the very laudable
</p>
<p>pains and attention which you have paid to the case, from the begin-
</p>
<p>ning to the end, when I consider the great inconvenience which your
</p>
<p>loss of time and absence from your pursuits must have caused you ;
</p>
<p>I am sorry it is no't in the power of the Court to order you compen-
</p>
<p>sation. The Act of Parliament does not warrant us to do so, nor
</p>
<p>891
</p>
<p>is there any law made, I believe, to meet the necessities of such an
</p>
<p>extraordinary case as this has been. The duty of a juryman is one
</p>
<p>imposed on every member of society ; each must perform it in his
</p>
<p>turn, when called on ; and I trust that all jurors so called on will
</p>
<p>follow the example set by the gentlemen whom I address, in paying
</p>
<p>such strict attention to what is brought under their consideration. It
</p>
<p>is, indeed, highly creditable and laudable, and I am sorry that my
</p>
<p>saying so is all I can do for you. I repeat, I have no power to order
</p>
<p>you compensation, and can do no more than thank you for your
</p>
<p>attendance, and dismiss you.
</p>
<p>The Jury were then discharged.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore asked if there was any objection to furnish the tra-
</p>
<p>versers with a copy of the finding ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton.  I can see no objection. T suppose
</p>
<p>you would not require a copy for each of the traversers ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore.  Certainly not, my lord, one will be sufficient.
</p>
<p>The Court then adjourned to the first day of next term.
</p>
<p>The following should have been inserted immediately before Mr.
</p>
<p>Moore's speech, but was accidentally omitted :
</p>
<p>Monday, January 29th.
</p>
<p>The names of the traversers having been called over, Mr. John
</p>
<p>O'Connell rose and addressing the Court said :  My Lord Chief
</p>
<p>Justice, I wish to make a few observations to the jury if your Lord-
</p>
<p>ship pleases. Something dropped from my counsel in his admirable
</p>
<p>speech on my behalf on Saturday, which, I fear, is calculated to create
</p>
<p>a misapprehension in the minds of the jury with regard to me, and if
</p>
<p>your Lordship will permit me I will not detain the Court many mo-
</p>
<p>ments. I wish to say, Gentlemen, that humble as I am, I have always
</p>
<p>been the advocate, and always will be the advocate of the full, entire,
</p>
<p>and perfect right of the people of Ireland to an independent Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment. I am not, therefore, one of those of whom my counsel spoke,
</p>
<p>who would accept of an occasional, or even an annual visit of the Im-
</p>
<p>perial Parliament to Dublin, or anything short of what I speak. I do

</p>
<p>not know whether this will prejudice me in your minds, Gentlemen
</p>
<p>of the Jury, but I would infinitely prefer that it should prejudice me,
</p>
<p>rather than allow it to be supposed I would for a moment compro-
</p>
<p>mise what I consider to be the inalienable right of our country to an
</p>
<p>independent Legislature.
</p>
<p>THE END.
