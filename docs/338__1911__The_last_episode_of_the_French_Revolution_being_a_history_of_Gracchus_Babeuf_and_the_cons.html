<p>PREFACE
</p>
<p>Of all the leading actors in the great drama of the
</p>
<p>French Revolution, there is probably none less
</p>
<p>known to the average reader of history than
</p>
<p>the subject of the present volume. All that has
</p>
<p>appeared in English in book form up to the present
</p>
<p>time consists, I believe, in Bronterre O'Brien's
</p>
<p>translation of Buonaroti's account of the jNlovement
</p>
<p>^of the " Equals," now long since out of print. The
</p>
<p>reason for this neglect, and for the lack of interest
</p>
<p>generally showTi in Babeuf, is probably in part to
</p>
<p>be looked for in the fact that Babeuf s public
</p>
<p>activity consisted of a kind of aftermath of the
</p>
<p>1 great historical events of the Revolution. The
</p>
<p>j Revolution, properly speaking, had run its course
</p>
<p>!__before Babeuf appeared on the scene. The principal
</p>
<p>leaders were fallen or dispersed, the ragged levies
</p>
<p>of the people's quarters of St Antoine and St
</p>
<p>Marceau had risen en masse for the last time, and
</p>
<p>had been beaten and disarmed by the forces of the

</p>
<p>new governing class that had installed itself in the
</p>
<p>10 PREFACE
</p>
<p>seats of the old royal and feudal authorities. Francois
</p>
<p>Noel Babeuf, the subsequent Gracchus, played no
</p>
<p>political role of any importance while the Revolu-
</p>
<p>tion was at its zenith. His name became first
</p>
<p>prominent in the year IV. (1795), when the Society,
</p>
<p>which later on met near the Pantheon, was formed.
</p>
<p>The usual fate of secret movements, of conspiracies,
</p>
<p>overtook Babeuf s. It was killed by treachery 
</p>
<p>killed, as its promoters fondly believed, on the eve
</p>
<p>of success. In a word, the movement was a failure,
</p>
<p>and its memory with the great world soon tended
</p>
<p>to pass into oblivion. Nevertheless, for students of
</p>
<p>the earlier democratic movements, and of the pre-
</p>
<p>cursors of modern Socialism, the agitation of Babeuf
</p>
<p>in the last decade of the eighteenth century must
</p>
<p>be of keen interest.
</p>
<p>I may mention that the following monograph
</p>
<p>represents the carrying out of a wish, expressed
</p>
<p>some years before he died, of my old friend, William
</p>
<p>Morris, who thought that a clear and concise
</p>
<p>account of the Babeuf incident in English was
</p>
<p>wanted, and who urged me to undertake the task.
</p>
<p>Whether this little volume answers the require-
</p>
<p>ments of the case must be left for the reader to
</p>
<p>judge.

<p>INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>To understand the history and the real significance
</p>
<p>of even the most prominent ideas of an epoch, it is
</p>
<p>necessary to reaUse what constitutes the mental
</p>
<p>background, as we may term it, of the period in
</p>
<p>question, for it is this that gives to the expressed
</p>
<p>ideas of a time their real significance. It has often
</p>
<p>been remarked that the same actual words or
</p>
<p>phrases may have a different meaning at different
</p>
<p>times. To take a familiar illustration  that of Dr
</p>
<p>Johnson's well-known aphorism that " patriotism is
</p>
<p>the last resort of scoundrels." The uneducated or
</p>
<p>half-educated man in the street of to-day would
</p>
<p>regard this viot as an attack by some "little
</p>
<p>Englander " on the Jingo or Imperialist with whom
</p>
<p>he is famihar,  the background of his mind, in the
</p>
<p>light of which he interprets it, consisting of the
</p>
<p>conditions of English politics that have grown up
</p>
<p>during the last generation. Needless to say, the
</p>
<p>expression to the mind of Dr Johnson, who first
</p>
<p>used it, had an entirely different, and in some
</p>

</p>
<p>13
</p>
<p>U GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>respects even an opposite, meaning. He knew
</p>
<p>nothing of modern Imperialism, of the glorious
</p>
<p>British Empire upon which the sun never sets :
</p>
<p>what was in his mind was the antithesis, not
</p>
<p>between the advocate of an aggressive British
</p>
<p>Empire and a respecter of the rights of weaker
</p>
<p>peoples, but an advocate of the rights of the people
</p>
<p>of a given country against its ruling classes. This
</p>
<p>was the sense in which the eighteenth century, for
</p>
<p>the most part, understood the words " patriot " and
</p>
<p>"patriotism," the great political antithesis of the
</p>
<p>eighteenth century being that between rulers and
</p>
<p>people. This is an obvious instance. But the
</p>
<p>capacity of the same form of words to express
</p>
<p>totally different meanings according to the age in
</p>
<p>which they appear, and the great danger of their
</p>
<p>entire falsification by reading into them the mind
</p>
<p>of a later period, can never be sufficiently present
</p>
<p>to the sense of the historian. Every form of ideas
</p>
<p>that belongs to a past period of history, no matter
</p>
<p>how modern it may look, we may be quite sure is
</p>
<p>not what it appears to us of the twentieth century
</p>
<p>at first sight. The intellectual background of the
</p>
<p>men w^ho enunciated the ideas in question is so
</p>
<p>different, that the meaning present to them in the
</p>
<p>expressions used and the meaning they evoke in
</p>
<p>us cannot possibly be the same.
</p>
<p>The above remarks apply to our estimation of

</p>
<p>eighteenth century thought generally, and, not least,
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION 15
</p>
<p>to the thought of the French Revolution. To
</p>
<p>understand this thought properly, we have to
</p>
<p>investigate the conditions that reflected themselves
</p>
<p>in the mental background of the leading actors.
</p>
<p>One thing we have to do is to eliminate all concep-
</p>
<p>tions having their origin in the doctrine of evolution
</p>
<p>from their mental framework. This it is somewhat
</p>
<p>difficult for the present generation effectually to
</p>
<p>accomplish. Our whole thought is so bound up
</p>
<p>with the notion of development, that it is difficult
</p>
<p>for us to realise the intellectual attitude of the man
</p>
<p>of intelligence to whom this idea has never presented
</p>
<p>itself. Yet, needless to say, to the eighteenth-
</p>
<p>century thinker in general it was entirely absent.
</p>
<p>Very noticeable is this in the theories of society
</p>
<p>prevalent during the eighteenth century, and that
</p>
<p>formed the groundwork of the thought of the
</p>
<p>French Revolution. The main principle upon
</p>
<p>which it all turned was that of conscious and
</p>
<p>arbitrary construction. Society, as it existed, was
</p>
<p>conceived as the outcome of a contract made in
</p>
<p>remote ages, and which might be unmade or altered
</p>
<p>at the will of its individual members at any time.
</p>
<p>The classics still bulked largely in the cultured
</p>
<p>man's outlook on history, politics, and the world in
</p>
<p>general. In seventeenth-century England this
</p>
<p>was modified by the place the Enghsh Bible held
</p>
<p>in the imagination of all classes. Hence in the

<p>British political struggles of the seventeenth century
</p>
<p>16 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>we find the Old Testament the great storehouse
</p>
<p>of instances on which the popular imagination falls
</p>
<p>back. In France of the eighteenth century, on the
</p>
<p>contrary, the classical tradition held undisturbed
</p>
<p>sway, alike with the cultivated and the popular
</p>
<p>intelligence. The very names indicate this. In
</p>
<p>the place of Biblical names we have Anacharsis
</p>
<p>Clootz, Anaxagoras Chaumette, Gracchus Babeuf,
</p>

<p>the English political movements of the preceding

<p>existence of the great machine-industry, did not

</p>
<p>exist. But a population, not as yet relatively very
</p>
<p>numerous except in a few large towns, of journey-
</p>
<p>men and labourers, which was destined to become
</p>
<p>the groundwork of the modern proletariat, did
</p>
<p>undoubtedly obtain, but obtained only as an
</p>
<p>economic appendix of the small middle-class to
</p>
<p>which reference has been made. The old feudal
</p>
<p>landowning class, which had come down from
</p>
<p>mediaeval times, had now in the main become an
</p>
<p>absentee landowning class, dancing attendance at
</p>
<p>courts and growing financially poorer. While still
</p>
<p>retaining many of its feudal privileges, it func-
</p>
<p>tioned for the most part through its members
</p>
<p>holding positions in the bureaucratic hierarchy
</p>
<p>which centred in the Crown. As a consequence
</p>
<p>of the foregoing conditions, the leading political
</p>
<p>category of the seventeenth and eighteenth cen-
</p>
<p>turies was that of Ruler and Subject. Similarly,
</p>
<p>the leading economic category was that of Rich
</p>
<p>and Poor. It may be said, of course, that these
</p>
<p>categories obtain also to-day. But they are no
</p>
<p>longer dominant as categories in their bare abstract-
</p>
<p>ness, as they were in the eighteenth century. In
</p>
<p>the Western Europe of modern times absolutism has
</p>
<p>uniformly broken down in favour of some form of
</p>
<p>popular representation. Hence there is, in theory
</p>
<p>at least, no longer a pure and unadulterated Ruler

<p>in the old sense, any more than there is a pure and

</p>
<p>Again, the corresponding leading antithesis c
</p>
<p>the eighteenth century in economics, that of Ric
</p>
<p>and Poor, has likewise in a measure lost it

<p>pregnancy in the modern world. The rich are n

<p>Capitalism, it is true that the financial Capitalis

<p>dominate the economic situation. The Industrie

</p>
<p>there is no homogeneous rich class to-day, there is
</p>
<p>certainly no homogeneous poor class : the small
</p>
<p>middle-class is more or less decadent. The " Poor,"
</p>
<p>like the " People," is, in short, an expression cover-
</p>
<p>ing various distinct social groups to-day, with aims
</p>
<p>and interests by no means always harmonious, not
</p>
<p>to say identical. To-day the economic antithesis
</p>
<p>receives its most adequate expression, not in the
</p>
<p>vague and more or less amorphous concepts of
</p>
<p>" Rich " and " Poor," but in the extreme poles of
</p>
<p>the antithesis, that of Capitalist on the one hand
</p>
<p>and Workman on the other.
</p>
<p>The CapitaHst System, which forms the eco-
</p>
<p>nomic basis of present society, points more and
</p>
<p>more to the possessor or effective controller of
</p>
<p>the means of production, on the one hand, and
</p>
<p>the workman who has nought but his labour

<p>power, on the other, as representing the salient

<p>economic antithesis of the world in which we
</p>
<p>live. It is, if one will, of course only a mode
</p>
<p>of the old time-honoured antithesis of Rich and

<p>Poor, but its importance consists in the fact that
</p>
<p>it is a mode which defines the relation with regard
</p>
<p>to contemporary conditions which the old, vague

<p>antithesis of Rich and Poor does not do. The latter

<p>section of society as then organised. In the France
</p>
<p>of the eighteenth century, the intellectual and
</p>
<p>bureaucratic middle-class, including the middle
</p>
<p>ranks of the clergy, attached by social and economic
</p>
<p>bonds to the smaller noblesse, and which formed
</p>
<p>the intellectual backbone of the moderate side of
</p>
<p>the Revolution, are not to be confounded, it should
</p>
<p>be observed, with the industrial middle -class.
</p>
<p>Though also men of the TliircL Estate, they must
</p>
<p>not be identified with the former. From them the
</p>
<p>ranks of the Constitutionalists and Girondists were
</p>
<p>mainly recruited.
</p>
<p>From what has been said, it wiU be evident how
</p>
<p>the appeals of Babeuf and those who thought like
</p>
<p>him were necessarily to the poor in general, unlike
</p>
<p>the appeal of the modern Socialist agitation, which
</p>
<p>is pre-eminently to the working-classes of the great
</p>
<p>industry  to the modern proletariat. Similarly,
</p>
<p>from the political side, the appeal of the French
</p>
<p>Revolutionist was to man in general. He called
</p>
<p>upon him to claim his rights as citizen. The appeal
</p>
<p>of the modern Socialist is not so much to man in
</p>
<p>general, to man in the abstract, as to man as the
</p>
<p>producer of wealth ; in other words, to the workman.
</p>
<p>He, the Socialist, calls upon the workman, as the
</p>
<p>producer of wealth, to claim his right as a class, to
</p>
<p>be at once possessor, controller, and organiser of
</p>
<p>production and the enjoyer of the wealth produced.

</p>
<p>The idea of citizenship is not sufficiently definite for
</p>
<p>22 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>modern use. All these considerations are necessar
</p>
<p>to be taken into account in judging the outlook o
</p>
<p>the men of the Revolution. Their sociolomcal anc
</p>
<p>pohtical prospective was abstract. They regarde(
</p>
<p>all things as dominated by abstractions  right
</p>
<p>virtue, citizenship, man.
</p>
<p>Even the great Revolutionary trinity, " Liberty
</p>
<p>Equality, Fraternity," was conceived of in th(
</p>
<p>abstract way of looking at things peculiar to th(
</p>
<p>eighteenth century. In the absence of the idei
</p>
<p>of evolution it was inevitable that society shoulc
</p>
<p>be regarded as governed by such abstract notions
</p>
<p>INJodern Socialist thought, on the other hand
</p>
<p>seeks a realisation of " Liberty, Equality, anc
</p>
<p>Fraternity" in the concrete development of i
</p>
<p>new society from germs present in existing society
</p>

</p>
<p>nomical, political, and ethical  which has in the

<p>past proceeded, in the main, independently o:

<p>the conscious will of man. To the eighteenth

<p>century, liberty was a formal pattern, to be appliec
</p>
<p>as a label is applied in the most superficial
</p>
<p>manner. The modern mind sees that often-
</p>
<p>times a formal liberty, such as that, for example,
</p>
<p>comprised in so-called " liberty of contract " as
</p>
<p>between the possessor of the means of production
</p>
<p>and the propertyless workman, is a mere form and

</p>
<p>is its very opposite. It is seen clearly by the modern
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION 23
</p>
<p>revolutionary thinker that the superficial form of
</p>
<p>any idea may easily be only a blind, and that what
</p>
<p>we have to look to is its concrete embodiment in a
</p>
<p>given society. To this more than a mere label is
</p>
<p>necessary. The Paris of the French Revolution
</p>
<p>was enamoured of the bare word " liberty," and
</p>
<p>felt it a revolutionary duty to apply it on every
</p>
<p>occasion and in every detail of life in its barest
</p>
<p>form, so that the Parisians of 1793 opened all the
</p>
<p>cages of their song-birds and let the inmates fly
</p>
<p>away, with the result that the streets of Paris were
</p>
<p>strewn with the dead bodies of canaries and other
</p>
<p>hapless victims. This is a trivial illustration of
</p>
<p>devotion to a term applied in its hard, formal
</p>
<p>abstraction, or as a label.
</p>
<p>We are not free even in the present day from
</p>
<p>the worship of an abstract phrase connoting an
</p>
<p>idea regardless of its real content. This is very
</p>
<p>noticeable in the modern Feminist movement. We
</p>
<p>find the notion of chivalry, as implying consideration
</p>
<p>and deference for weakness, exploited to its fullest
</p>
<p>extent by the Feminist advocate, by using the
</p>
<p>notion of weakness as a superficial label applied to
</p>
<p>every member of the female sex, regardless of the
</p>
<p>facts or circumstances of any given case, or of the
</p>
<p>general social conditions obtaining to-day. As a
</p>
<p>matter of fact, the physical strength or weakness of
</p>
<p>the individual counts for very little in the present

</p>
<p>prowess, but by the power of the State, through its
</p>
<p>accredited organs. A woman in the power of the
</p>
<p>law or opposed by superior force could under no
</p>
<p>circumstances be in worse case than a man
</p>
<p>similarly situated. But the fact is, by virtue of
</p>
<p>this very sex weakness she is in a much stronger
</p>
<p>position than the man, and hence deserves much
</p>
<p>less pity than a man would do under like circum-
</p>
<p>stances. A maudlin sentiment is sought to be
</p>
<p>aroused in the public mind by the employment of
</p>
<p>the notions of weakness and chivalry as the label,
</p>
<p>the justification for which is purely formal and
</p>
<p>abstract, and which is contradicted by the content
</p>
<p>of every given case, as determined by existing law
</p>
<p>and public opinion. Formal sex weakness and
</p>
<p>disability has thus been converted into real sex
</p>
<p>strength and domination. But by dint of ignoring
</p>
<p>this conversion, and taking his stand on physio-
</p>
<p>logical facts which under modern conditions have
</p>
<p>become purely irrelevant, the feminist can succeed
</p>
<p>in hoodwinking public opinion as to the reality
</p>
<p>embodied in the facts, and hence as to the true
</p>
<p>distribution of effective strength and weakness
</p>
<p>between the sexes in modern society.

</p>
<p>which the political activity proper of Babeuf began.
</p>
<p>The day after the opening of the States- General
</p>
<p>was signalised by the insistence of the Third
</p>
<p>Estate on its being joined by the other Estates in
</p>
<p>the large hall of Versailles. Wrangling as to the
</p>
<p>form the deliberations should take  the First and

<p>Second Estates, i.e. the nobility and higher clergy,
</p>
<p>with few exceptions, refusing to unite in the

<p>same council chamber with the Third Estate  con-

<p>tinued till June the 15th, when, on the proposal of

<p>the Abbe Sieyes, the Third Estate proclaimed itself

<p>the representative assembly of the French nation.
</p>
<p>The title of National Assembly was adopted the

<p>next day. This action was followed on the 20th
</p>
<p>of the month by the closing of the great hall by

<p>the king and the adjournment of the Constituent

<p>National Assembly to the Tennis Court, where the
</p>
<p>famous oath was taken not to separate till a con-

</p>
<p>On the 11th of July the king refused to accede to
</p>
<p>the Assembly's request to remove the troops then
</p>
<p>at Versailles, and at the same time dismissed the
</p>
<p>popular minister, Necker. The latter event aroused
</p>
<p>the whole of Paris, and was followed by meetings
</p>
<p>and tumults throughout the city. The next day
</p>
<p>a citizen guard was formed in Paris sixty thousand
</p>
<p>strong, pikes were forged and guns sought for.
</p>
<p>On the 14th, in the belief that a royal attack on
</p>
<p>the city from Versailles was imminent, the search
</p>
<p>for arms was redoubled, the Bastille was stormed
</p>
<p>and taken.
</p>
<p>Emigration of nobles now began on a large
</p>
<p>scale, and at the same time the burning of chateaux
</p>
<p>went on throughout the countryside. On the
</p>
<p>celebrated night of the 4th of August the Assembly
</p>
<p>aboHshed all feudal rights, and established equality

<p>before the law and personal liberty, by decree.
</p>
<p>Within the next few days the lands and buildings

<p>of the Church were in principle declared national

<p>royal palace were invaded by the populace, the
</p>
<p>majority of whom remained in Versailles through-
</p>
<p>out the night, renewing the attack on the palace
</p>
<p>the following day. The upshot of the whole aifair
</p>
<p>was that on the afternoon of October 6th the royal
</p>
<p>family were forced to follow the crowd to Paris,
</p>
<p>taking up their residence in the Tuileries. The
</p>
<p>Assembly soon transferred itself also to Paris,
</p>
<p>where it continued its work of building up the
</p>
<p>constitution.
</p>
<p>The map of France was now altered, the old
</p>
<p>produces abolished, and their place taken by eighty-
</p>
<p>three departments, with corresponding administra-
</p>
<p>tive bodies. The old parliaments were aboHshed
</p>
<p>and new law courts established. The civil con-
</p>
<p>stitution of the clergy was now completed and pro-
</p>
<p>mulgated. On November the 3rd the Assembly
</p>
<p>formally confiscated the effects of the clergy,
</p>
<p>abolishing them as a separate order.
</p>
<p>About this time the Jacobin Club, so called

<p>from its meeting in the old Jacobin convent in the

<p>other places in the neighbourhood of the French
</p>
<p>frontiers by the Court. The ecclesiastical estates
</p>
<p>were now sold, and served as the security for the
</p>
<p>new issue of paper money iassignats) inaugurated
</p>
<p>by Necker. On the 14th of July of this year, 1790,
</p>
<p>the anniversary of the taking of the Bastille, a great
</p>
<p>festival of the Federation of all France was held in
</p>
<p>Paris, on the Champs de INIars. Soon after this,
</p>
<p>fresh clubs sprang up in all directions, which became
</p>
<p>affiliated to the Jacobin Society of Paris. In Paris
</p>
<p>itself, the Club of the Cordeliers, which embraced
</p>
<p>Danton, Marat, and Hebert, was founded as a more
</p>
<p>democratic rival of the Jacobins.
</p>
<p>In August occurred the famous affiiir of Nancy,
</p>
<p>which began by an outrage offered to two envoys
</p>
<p>of a Swiss regiment by French officers. This Swiss
</p>
<p>regiment became popular with French revolutionists
</p>
<p>everywhere. Bouille, the commander of the troops
</p>
<p>on the eastern frontier, ordered the Swiss to evacuate
</p>
<p>Nancy, where they were quartered. They refused,
</p>
<p>with the result that Bouille, with the aid of some
</p>
<p>German regiments and seven hundred royalist
</p>
<p>guards, ordered a massacre, in which half of the
</p>
<p>Swiss regiment fell, after which twenty-one were
</p>
<p>hanged and fifty sent to the galleys. This affair
</p>
<p>of the " Nancy massacre," as it was called, was an

<p>epoch-making event, fraught with important con-

<p>INTRODUCTION 29
</p>
<p>sequences to the Revolution. Henceforward the
</p>
<p>Assembly, which had played an equivocal role in the
</p>
<p>whole business, together with the king condoning
</p>
<p>Bouille's crime, became more and more distrusted
</p>
<p>by the popular party. The clubs developed an
</p>
<p>extraordinary activity, and rose to be of paramount
</p>
<p>importance in the political life of Paris and of
</p>
<p>France.
</p>
<p>Early in September, soon after the news of the
</p>
<p>Nancy massacre arrived in Paris, Necker escaped
</p>
<p>from Paris and France, having become unpopular,
</p>
<p>and impossible any longer as Finance Minister.
</p>
<p>In January the clergy in the Assembly were
</p>
<p>challenged to take the oath to the Constitution.
</p>
<p>Many of them refused, thereby exacerbating the
</p>
<p>situation. On April the 2nd, Mirabeau, the most
</p>
<p>powerful mediating force between the old and the
</p>
<p>new regimes, died. This left an opening for the
</p>
<p>influence of Robespierre and other leaders of the
</p>
<p>Jacobin and Cordelier Clubs.
</p>
<p>On the night of the 20th of June the famous
</p>
<p>attempted flight of the king took place, the idea
</p>
<p>being that Louis, together with his family, was to
</p>
<p>be received by Bouille on the eastern frontier, prior
</p>
<p>to the latter marching on Paris with his army to
</p>
<p>suppress the Revolution. The king, as is well
</p>
<p>known, was recognised by the ex-dragoon and
</p>
<p>postmaster Drouet, who apprised the authorities

<p>at Varennes, the next town at which the royal
</p>
<p>30 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>party would have to change horses, with the result
</p>
<p>that Louis and his belongings were brought back
</p>
<p>to Paris. Henceforward the popular party was
</p>
<p>becoming more and more republican. The mod-
</p>
<p>erate party in the Assembly succeeded in getting
</p>
<p>the king reinstated after his virtual abdication,
</p>
<p>under conditions, which did not, however, satisfy
</p>
<p>the popular party, the latter demanding his
</p>
<p>summary dethronement, if not the estabhshment
</p>
<p>of a Republic. A gigantic petition to this effect,
</p>
<p>and claiming that the matter should be brought
</p>
<p>before the nation, was carried to the Champs de
</p>
<p>JMars by an immense crowd on July the 17th of
</p>
<p>this year (1791). Lafayette, accompanied by the
</p>
<p>mayor of Paris, Bailly, arrived on the ground at
</p>
<p>the head of a force of the National Guard : result,
</p>
<p>the notorious massacre of the Champs de INIars.
</p>
<p>This event produced consternation in the ranks of
</p>
<p>the popular party, and a temporary check to the
</p>
<p>Revolutionary movement.
</p>
<p>At the end of September the Constituent
</p>
<p>Assembly, which, as we have seen, consisted of
</p>
<p>the members of the States- General elected in 1789,
</p>
<p>was dissolved. The newly elected Chamber, called
</p>
<p>the Legislative Assembly, met on the 1st of
</p>
<p>October. In this second parliament the party
</p>
<p>called at the time Brissotins, fi'om their leader
</p>
<p>Brissot, but known subsequently by the name of

<p>Girondins, from the department of the Gironde,
</p>
<p>mTRODUCTION 31
</p>
<p>from which many of their chief orators came, was
</p>
<p>in the ascendancy. Petion became mayor of Paris.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the king vetoed various decrees passed
</p>
<p>by the Assembly. At the same time he was
</p>
<p>compelled formally to remonstrate to the central
</p>
<p>European Powers for harbouring and encouraging
</p>
<p>the emigres who held a kind of court at Coblentz,
</p>
<p>and whose agents were active throughout Europe
</p>
<p>in their avowed intention of invading France at
</p>
<p>the first opportunity to restore the absolute mon-
</p>
<p>archy. France remained in a state of seething
</p>
<p>discontent throughout the ensuing winter, and the
</p>
<p>relations with foreign powers were to the last
</p>
<p>degree strained.
</p>
<p>Finally, in JMarch 1792, Louis was forced to
</p>
<p>appoint a Girondin ministry, which promptly
</p>
<p>demanded explanations from the Austrian Court.
</p>
<p>The upshot was a kind of ultimatum on the part
</p>
<p>of the emperor, demanding a return to the and en
</p>
<p>regime, including the restoration of Church pro-
</p>
<p>perty, and the cession of Alsace to the German
</p>
<p>princes.
</p>
<p>War was at last declared on the 20th of April,
</p>
<p>on the proposition of the king, who hoped for
</p>
<p>a successful invasion of the country, resulting
</p>
<p>in the restoration of his ovm power, and also by
</p>
<p>this means to drain off into the army to a large
</p>
<p>extent the revolutionary elements of the home

</p>
<p>population. The declaration of war was greeted
</p>
<p>32 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>with enthusiasm in Paris, as affording a rehef from
</p>
<p>the tension of the previous months. The French
</p>
<p>forces consisted of three armies  the army of the
</p>
<p>north under Richambeau, the army of the centre
</p>
<p>under Lafayette, and the army of the Rhine under
</p>
<p>Luckner. The war began by an unsuccessful
</p>
<p>invasion of Brabant. The Jacobins accused the
</p>
<p>counter-revolutionaries generally of plotting for
</p>
<p>the defeat of the French armies, and the officers
</p>
<p>of treachery. On June the 28th the Assembly
</p>
<p>decreed the formation of a military camp before
</p>
<p>Paris. This decree, together with another con-
</p>
<p>cerning the priests who refused to take the oath
</p>
<p>of loyalty to the constitution, Louis peremptorily
</p>
<p>vetoed.
</p>
<p>On the 20th of June an insurrectionary move-
</p>
<p>ment took place in Paris, the populace breaking
</p>
<p>into the Tuileries. From this time the movement
</p>
<p>for the deposition of Louis and the abolition of
</p>
<p>the monarchy gained by leaps and bounds every
</p>
<p>day. On June the 28th, Lafayette, having left his
</p>
<p>army, appeared in Paris to demand the suppression
</p>
<p>and punishment of the Jacobin party for the riot
</p>
<p>of the 20th. He obtained no favourable hearing
</p>
<p>from anyone, and returned discomfited to his army,
</p>
<p>which he not long afterwards deserted, fleeing across
</p>
<p>the frontier.

<p>teers went on ; numbers of these came to Paris,
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION 33
</p>
<p>ostensibly for the festival of the 14th of July. On
</p>
<p>the 22nd of July the country was declared in danger;
</p>
<p>the enrolment of volunteers received a double im-
</p>
<p>petus. Recruits from the provinces arrived daily in
</p>
<p>Paris. The Paris wardships or sections declared
</p>
<p>themselves in permanent session. On the 25th,
</p>
<p>Brunswick launched his famous manifesto from
</p>
<p>Coblentz, and started on the march to Paris. Some
</p>
<p>members of the newly enrolled Federal guards
</p>
<p>formed a permanent committee at the Jacobins,
</p>
<p>while the forty-eight sections of the city appointed
</p>
<p>a central committee from their number to sit in
</p>
<p>the Hotel de Ville. On the 29th a newly created
</p>
<p>battalion of guards from Marseilles arrived in Paris,
</p>
<p>singing its war hymn, subsequently known as the
</p>
<p>Marseillaise. The demands for the dethronement
</p>
<p>of the king, by the Jacobin and popular party
</p>
<p>generally, became more clamorous and insistent
</p>
<p>than ever. Finally, on the 9th of August, a general
</p>
<p>assembly of the sections took place at the Hotel
</p>
<p>de Ville, at which it was agreed to demand the
</p>
<p>immediate abdication of the king, faiHng which, it
</p>
<p>was resolved to storm the palace of the Tuileries
</p>
<p>at midnight. The old municipal council, with its
</p>
<p>mayor, was then declared dissolved, and its place
</p>
<p>taken by a Revolutionary Commune.
</p>
<p>The attack on the Tuileries took place actually
</p>
<p>in the early morning of the 10th of August, with
</p>
<p>the result that is well known. Louis was sub-

<p>sequently imprisoned with his family in the
</p>
<p>Temple, under the orders of the Revolutionary
</p>
<p>Commune. By the end of August news of the
</p>
<p>clerical and royalist outbreak in La Vendee reached
</p>
<p>Paris. The arrest of supposed royalist plotters
</p>
<p>within the capital took place wholesale. From
</p>
<p>the 3rd to the 6th of September the so-called
</p>
<p>September massacres were enacted by a body of
</p>
<p>persons between two and three hundred strong,
</p>
<p>who went from prison to prison killing supposed
</p>
<p>traitors. At about the same time Dumouriez, at
</p>
<p>the head of the raw levies of volunteers recently
</p>
<p>formed, drove back from the wooded ridges of the
</p>
<p>Argonne the armies of Brunswick. A week or
</p>
<p>two later a decisive victory of the French at
</p>
<p>Valmy relieved the situation.
</p>
<p>The old Legislative Assembly having been dis-
</p>
<p>solved, and a National Convention convoked on
</p>
<p>a basis of universal but indirect suffrage, the
</p>
<p>new legislative body opened its sittings on
</p>
<p>September the 21st. The dethronement of the
</p>
<p>king and the establishment of a Republic was
</p>
<p>immediately decreed. A committee to draw
</p>
<p>up the basis of a new constitution, founded on
</p>
<p>the sovereignty of the people, was nominated.
</p>
<p>Within the Convention, two distinct parties formed
</p>
<p>themselves, the old Girondist party reinforced,
</p>
<p>and the popular party, representing mainly the

</p>
<p>of its members sitting on the highest benches of
</p>
<p>the place of assembly. Outside these two parties
</p>
<p>were the mass of members called the Plain, or,
</p>
<p>in derision, the Marsh. The latter usually voted
</p>
<p>with the party which was for the time being in
</p>
<p>power. The famine in Paris, especially the scarcity
</p>
<p>of bread, now assumed serious proportions ; bread
</p>
<p>riots were of daily occurrence. Within the Con-
</p>
<p>vention, exacerbation of parties grew daily more
</p>
<p>acute. The special hete noire of the Girondists
</p>
<p>was INlarat, but they also dreaded Robespierre, as
</p>
<p>aiming at the Dictatorship. After weeks of
</p>
<p>wrangling, Louis was finally judged by the Con-
</p>
<p>vention and condemned to death without delay.
</p>
<p>On the 21st of January 1793 his execution took
</p>
<p>place on the Place de la Revolution, formerly
</p>
<p>Place Royale.
</p>
<p>After the king's death the feud between the
</p>
<p>Mountain and the Gironde grew more bitter.
</p>
<p>The Girondists, claiming to represent the provinces
</p>
<p>as against Paris, the stronghold of the Mountain,
</p>
<p>favoured a federal republic ; the Mountain, on the
</p>
<p>other hand, insisted on an united and centralised
</p>
<p>republic, dominated by Paris. The large towns of
</p>
<p>the departments favoured the federal idea, and
</p>
<p>hence its exponents, the Girondists, while Paris
</p>
<p>remained faithful to the Mountain. Up to this
</p>
<p>time the executive power had, in the main,

</p>
<p>continued uninterruptedly in the hands of the
</p>
<p>36 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>Girondins. But the disasters now overtaking
</p>
<p>Dumouriez, the favourite general of the party,
</p>
<p>in his attempt to invade Holland, cast a sus-
</p>
<p>picion of treachery, not only upon Dumouriez
</p>
<p>himself, but more or less affected the whole
</p>
<p>Girondist faction in the popular mind. Demands
</p>
<p>were made on various sides for the arrest and ex-
</p>
<p>pulsion of twenty-two of the leading Girondists.
</p>
<p>In March, forty-four thousand communes through-
</p>
<p>out France now each appointed its permanent
</p>
<p>revolutionary committee to watch affairs, and
</p>
<p>especially to arrest and imprison suspected traitors
</p>
<p>and reactionaries.
</p>
<p>The Girondists now succeeded in getting a
</p>
<p>commission appointed to inquire into alleged
</p>
<p>plots of the Jacobins and the popular party
</p>
<p>generally. They also obtained the indictment of
</p>
<p>ilarat on a charge of inciting to disorder and
</p>
<p>breaches of the peace. INIarat was tried, but
</p>
<p>triumphantly acquitted. These measures did not
</p>
<p>serve their authors, the Girondins, in any way, but
</p>
<p>merely helped to irritate their opponents. The
</p>
<p>rage of Paris, the JVlountain, and the Jacobins
</p>
<p>against the party hitherto dominant in the Con-
</p>
<p>vention reached its climax in the last days of
</p>
<p>May, when the Commune took the lead in a
</p>
<p>popular insurrection against the Convention and
</p>
<p>the authorities. This ended on the 2nd of June

</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION 37
</p>
<p>deputies, two ministers, and of the hated Com-
</p>
<p>mission of Twelve. The only hope for the Girondist
</p>
<p>faction lay now in the raising of the departments
</p>
<p>against what was represented as the dictatorship
</p>
<p>of Paris.
</p>
<p>On the 14th of July, Charlotte Corday, egged
</p>
<p>on by Girondist misrepresentation, murdered Marat.
</p>
<p>The effect of this event throughout the country
</p>
<p>was immense. It roused the indignation of the
</p>
<p>whole of revolutionary France, vastly strengthen-
</p>
<p>ing the position of the Mountain and the Jacobins.
</p>
<p>Up to this time the situation of the Girondists was
</p>
<p>not unfavourable. The chances of the Girondists'
</p>
<p>insurrection seemed by no means hopeless. They
</p>
<p>had the bulk of the provinces with them, includ-
</p>
<p>ing the large cities of the south. But before the
</p>
<p>end of July the Girondist army melted away
</p>
<p>without having struck a blow. The cities Lyons,
</p>
<p>Bordeaux, Marseilles, Caen, etc., that still adhered
</p>
<p>to the Girondist cause, were taken by the National
</p>
<p>Forces of the Republic, and for the most part
</p>
<p>paid heavily for their partisanship. Meanwhile
</p>
<p>the committee for drawing up the new constitu-
</p>
<p>tion had finished its labours. The draft was
</p>
<p>submitted to the forty-four thousand communes
</p>
<p>of France, and accepted by an enormous majority.
</p>
<p>On the 10th of August, the anniversary of the
</p>
<p>taking of the Tuileries, the constitution was

</p>
<p>promulgated in Paris with great rejoicings. This
</p>
<p>38 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>was the famous Constitution of 1793, which became
</p>
<p>the political sheet-anchor of the French democracy.
</p>
<p>Soon after the revolution which had placed the
</p>
<p>Mountain in power, the recently formed and now
</p>
<p>strengthened executive body, the Committee of
</p>
<p>Public Safety, had decided that a democratic con-
</p>
<p>stitution in accordance with the views of the
</p>
<p>Jacobins should be drawn up. The task of doing
</p>
<p>this was entrusted to a prominent member of the
</p>
<p>Convention, the ex-noble and friend of Danton,
</p>
<p>Herault de Sechelles. He was assisted by four
</p>
<p>other Montagnards  St Just, Couthon, Ramel, and
</p>
<p>Mathieu. His draft was adopted by the Conven-
</p>
<p>tion on June the 10th. It may be remarked that
</p>
<p>the question of the constitution had been promi-
</p>
<p>nently before the Convention, and more than one
</p>
<p>draft had been made by the Girondists, which had
</p>
<p>been received coldly by the Convention and public
</p>
<p>opinion, and actively opposed by the Mountain.
</p>
<p>The constitution of Herault de Sechelles and his
</p>
<p>colleagues, called the Constitution of 1793, was the
</p>
<p>first and only constitution emanating officially from
</p>
<p>the Mountain and the Jacobins. This constitution,
</p>
<p>though adopted, as stated, by an enormous majority
</p>
<p>of the French people through their primary
</p>
<p>assemblies, was suspended immediately after it
</p>
<p>was promulgated, and never became operative.
</p>
<p>Invasion now threatened France from all sides.

<p>It was in August 1793 that the two committees,
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION 39
</p>
<p>that of Public Safety, sometimes called the Com-
</p>
<p>mittee of Government, and that of General
</p>
<p>Security, concerned mainly with the executive
</p>
<p>functions of police, respectively, were given largely
</p>
<p>increased powers, amounting practically to those of
</p>
<p>a dictatorship. Superhuman efforts were now
</p>
<p>made to raise and equip more troops ; every^vhere
</p>
<p>were enlistments and requisitions. The Republic
</p>
<p>has been adequately described as presenting, in this
</p>
<p>autumn of 1793, the appearance of an armed camp.
</p>
<p>It was now that the " Reign of Terror " began in
</p>
<p>earnest. The Committee of Public Safety declared
</p>
<p>that the Republic was revolutionary, and must
</p>
<p>remain so until all danger from the enemy was
</p>
<p>past. The incriminated Girondists were tried
</p>
<p>before the Revolutionary Tribunal and guillotined.
</p>
<p>The rest of the party were either imprisoned or
</p>
<p>outlawed. JNIarie Antoinette, generals, ex-deputies
</p>
<p>of the constituent and legislative assemblies, nobles,
</p>
<p>and officials of the ancien regime fell beneath the
</p>
<p>national knife, now in daily operation.
</p>
<p>In October 1793 the revolutionary government
</p>
<p>was proclaimed, the dictatorship of the Committee
</p>
<p>of Pubhc Safety came into full force, and with it
</p>
<p>the power of its now strongest member, Robes-

<p>installed as, de jure, the supreme authority in

<p>to wit, the Paris Commune. At first it was the
</p>
<p>Commune that effectively dominated the situation.
</p>
<p>Chaumette and Hebert had just instituted the
</p>
<p>worship of Reason on the ruins of CathoUcism.
</p>
<p>The Commune, by means of its revolutionary army,
</p>
<p>consisting of six or seven thousand men under the
</p>
<p>command of Rousin, the dramatic author, under-
</p>
<p>took the purification of the provinces from reac-
</p>
<p>tionary elements, although its immediate action
</p>
<p>was mainly confined to the departments around
</p>
<p>Paris. But throughout France at this time guillo-
</p>
<p>tining was going on. Carrier was sent to Nantes ;
</p>
<p>Lebon to Arras ; JMaignet, Fouche, Barras, Freron
</p>
<p>were despatched to the cities of the south ; and
</p>
<p>everywhere the revolutionary committees were
</p>
<p>active in hunting down traitors or supposed
</p>
<p>traitors.
</p>
<p>By the end of 1793 fourteen armies were in the
</p>
<p>field. The year closed amid the success of the
</p>
<p>French arms everywhere. Friction, however,
</p>
<p>between the two rival central powers, the Com-
</p>
<p>mittee of Public Safety and the Paris Commune,
</p>
<p>had already begun. The attack on the Paris
</p>
<p>Commune, or the Hebertist faction, as it was
</p>
<p>now called, from Hebert, one of its chief members
</p>
<p>and editor of the Pere Duchesne journal, by the
</p>
<p>followers of Robespierre, was started by Robespierre

</p>
<p>was still strong. In October it inaugurated the new
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION 41
</p>
<p>worship of Reason. Robespierres determination
</p>
<p>to crush the rival power was now formed. At the
</p>
<p>same time, within the Convention, the Mountain
</p>
<p>was, however, showing signs of getting out of hand.
</p>
<p>Two members, who expressed the ^^ew that the
</p>
<p>committees were terrorising over the Convention,
</p>
<p>were arrested and imprisoned in consequence. In
</p>
<p>the provinces the representatives " on mission "
</p>
<p>dominated the situation, acting in many cases as
</p>
<p>local dictators.
</p>
<p>The friction between the Committee of Public
</p>
<p>Safety, whose soul was Robespierre, and the
</p>
<p>Commune of Paris, led by Chaumette and Hebert,
</p>
<p>continued throughout the early part of 1794. Of
</p>
<p>the two chief clubs, the Jacobins and the CordeUers,
</p>
<p>the stronghold of Robespierre and his Committee
</p>
<p>was the Jacobins ; that of the Commune, i.e. of
</p>
<p>Hebert and his followers, was the Cordeliers.
</p>
<p>But there was a third party already in the field.
</p>
<p>Danton and his fiiends had been for some time
</p>
<p>past " lying low." Danton himself had been away
</p>
<p>at his home at Arcis, whence he was recalled by
</p>
<p>his political associates. The latter, with the
</p>
<p>approval of their leader, started a journal vehe-
</p>
<p>mently hostile to the Hebertists and the Terror,
</p>
<p>which was edited and mostly written by Camille
</p>
<p>Desmouhns. It was called Le vieiLV Cordelier, in
</p>
<p>allusion to the CordeUers Club in the old days when

</p>
<p>Danton was its moving spirit. In their campaign
</p>
<p>42 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>against the Terror, the Dantonists hoped to find
</p>
<p>support in the Convention, but, as events proved,
</p>
<p>they were relying on a broken reed. Robespierre
</p>
<p>and his party had now two enemies to contend
</p>
<p>with. On the one hand he had the Enrages, as
</p>
<p>they were termed, namely, the Hebertists, and on
</p>
<p>the other the Pacivists, that is, Danton and his
</p>
<p>friends. It was not part of Robespierre's purpose,
</p>
<p>or that of his committee, to relax the Terror at
</p>
<p>this moment. On the other hand, Robespierre was
</p>
<p>much concerned that the handling of the system
</p>
<p>of the Terror should not get into the control of his
</p>
<p>Extremist enemies on the opposite side.
</p>
<p>Early in March matters reached a climax. One
</p>
<p>or other of the two rival powers had to succumb.
</p>
<p>The only course for the Hebertists and the Cordeliers
</p>
<p>lay in a successful insurrection, which would break
</p>
<p>the power of the committee and of Robespierre.
</p>
<p>The beginnings of an attempt were made, but mis-
</p>
<p>carried. A panic seemed to seize the Cordeliers,
</p>
<p>and no more active measures were taken. Robes-
</p>
<p>pierre had now the upper hand, and lost no time
</p>
<p>in having the leaders of the " Hebertist faction "
</p>
<p>arrested and dragged before the Revolutionary
</p>
<p>Tribunal, there to be charged with conspiring to
</p>
<p>destroy the Revolution by discrediting it through
</p>
<p>the excesses of their doctrines and policy.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, on March the 24th, the leaders of
</p>
<p>the Extremist party, Hebert, Ronsin, and Momoro,

<p>with others, went to the guillotine, Chaumette
</p>
<p>following a few days later. The revolutionary
</p>
<p>army was disbanded, and the Commune reorganised
</p>
<p>and filled with the creatures of Robespierre.
</p>
<p>Having crushed his Extremist rivals, it only
</p>
<p>remained for Robespierre to destroy his Moderate
</p>
<p>foes. This followed with little delay. On March
</p>
<p>the 30th, DesmouHns, Philippeaux, and Wester-
</p>
<p>mann, with other friends of Danton, were arrested.
</p>
<p>Danton himself in vain attempted to get a hearing
</p>
<p>in the Convention, Robespierre effectually succeed-
</p>
<p>ing in closing his mouth. On April the 3rd he,
</p>
<p>together with the members of his party, was
</p>
<p>brought before the Revolutionary Tribunal, where
</p>
<p>he defended himself with such vigour that Robes-
</p>
<p>pierre had to extort a decree from the Convention
</p>
<p>depriving the accused of the right of speech. Two
</p>
<p>days later Danton and the remaining Dantonists
</p>
<p>were sent to the guillotine.
</p>
<p>The power of Robespierre was now supreme.
</p>
<p>His next thought was the foundation of a deistic
</p>
<p>cult, of which he himself was to be the sovereign
</p>
<p>pontiff, as a counterblast to the atheistic worship
</p>
<p>of Reason inaugurated by the Hebertists. The
</p>
<p>Convention obediently voted his instructions in
</p>
<p>this respect, and the Festival of the Supreme
</p>
<p>Being was held on June the 8th, 1794, in the

<p>Tuileries gardens, the principal features of the

</p>
<p>Robespierre, following which he set fire to certain
</p>
<p>stage-property figures constructed to represent
</p>
<p>atheism and other doctrines of the Hebertists
</p>
<p>that he disliked. The Convention, which at
</p>
<p>Robespierre's behest had shortly before decreed
</p>
<p>the existence of a Supreme Being and the immor-
</p>
<p>tality of the soul, was, two days after the festival
</p>
<p>in honour of these dogmas, called upon by the
</p>
<p>same dictator to pass the celebrated law of
</p>
<p>Prairial, which enacted that no prisoner haled
</p>
<p>before the Revolutionary Tribunal should have the
</p>
<p>right of any defence whatever.
</p>
<p>The next weeks saw a frightful increase in the
</p>
<p>activity of the guillotine, which every day received
</p>
<p>its holocausts. But at the same time an under-
</p>
<p>current of fear and detestation and indeterminate
</p>
<p>revolt was rising higher and higher every day.
</p>
<p>JMeanwhile, on the 26th June, the battle of Fleurus
</p>
<p>was won by General Jourdan, and the enemy
</p>
<p>driven from the Austrian Netherlands. Thus was
</p>
<p>France freed from danger, and the last point of
</p>
<p>her threatened frontiers relieved. The imminent
</p>
<p>danger of a foreign invasion was now definitely
</p>
<p>conjured, and therewith the main excuse for the
</p>
<p>institution of the " Terror "' crumbled to pieces.
</p>
<p>But nevertheless the Terror continued.

<p>At last the reckoning came. It was on the 9th

<p>daily becoming more and more isolated amid the
</p>
<p>hatred and imperfectly suppressed revolt of Con-
</p>
<p>vention and committee men, on the 8th of Thermi-
</p>
<p>dor (July the 26th) appeared in the Convention after
</p>
<p>a long absence, with a violent and threatening
</p>
<p>speech, demanding powers to purge the Convention
</p>
<p>and the committees alike. This, after a moment's
</p>
<p>hesitation on the part of the Convention, started the
</p>
<p>open revolt against the Robespierrian dictatorship.
</p>
<p>At the sitting of the following day, Robespierre and
</p>
<p>his partisans, including his brother, Couthon, St Just,
</p>
<p>and Lebas, were decreed accused. In the early
</p>
<p>morning of the 28th. Robespierre and his partisans
</p>
<p>were surrounded in the Hotel de Ville. At four
</p>
<p>o'clock in the afternoon Robespierre himself and
</p>
<p>the other chiefs of the Robespierrian faction fell
</p>
<p>beneath the guillotine. Thus ended the celebrated
</p>
<p>revolution of the 9th of Thermidor (27th of July),

<p>year II. (1794). The immediate upshot was the
</p>
<p>end of the system of the Terror, soon followed by

<p>serious modifications in the public authorities.

<p>Various economic measures passed by the Con-
</p>

<p>ably to enter the pathway of reaction.

<p>the great political activity of Gracchus Babeuf in

<p>46 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>Paris began, and began in the sense of the Ther-
</p>
<p>midoreans, as the makers of the recent revolution
</p>
<p>were termed. The earher period of his Paris
</p>
<p>journalism was signalised, as the reader will see,
</p>
<p>by vehement attacks on the fallen regime of the
</p>
<p>Terror and all connected with it. His subsequent
</p>
<p>change of opinions in this connection must be
</p>
<p>directly attributed to the reactionary character
</p>
<p>assumed by the new government, which was
</p>
<p>manned by Thermidoreans, and by the Conven-
</p>
<p>tion itself, dominated, as it was, by the members
</p>
<p>of the same party and other reactionary elements,
</p>
<p>such as the remnants of the Girondin faction
</p>
<p>which were allowed to regain possession of their
</p>
<p>seats in the national legislature. With his grow-
</p>
<p>ing bitterness towards the new authorities and
</p>
<p>the daily increasing reaction generally, moreover,
</p>
<p>grew Babeuf's clearness of vision as to the ends
</p>
<p>he ultimately had in view. The Constitution of
</p>
<p>1793, and the other political objects for which he
</p>
<p>strove, he now regarded merely as a means towards
</p>
<p>a communistic state of society, which was neces-
</p>
<p>sarily conceived by him under the only guise
</p>
<p>possible for a man of the eighteenth century to

</p>
<p>CHAPTER I
</p>
<p>ORIGIN AND YOUTH OF BABEUF
</p>
<p>Francois Noel Babeuf, it has now been decided
</p>
<p>by the researches of M. Victor Advielle, was born at
</p>
<p>St Quentin, on Sunday the 23rd November 1760.
</p>
<p>Babeuf, in some of the 7iotes intimes which the
</p>
<p>industry of the same investigator has unearthed,
</p>
<p>states, that he was born of so dehcate a constitu-
</p>
<p>tion that he was not expected to Hve. This he
</p>
<p>attributes to the poor circumstances of his parents,
</p>
<p>and the privations of his mother during her preg-
</p>
<p>nancy. Babeufs father appears to have been
</p>
<p>many years older than his mother. The former is
</p>
<p>described in the certificate of birth as " employe
</p>
<p>des fermes du roy an Faubourg St JNIartin de la
</p>
<p>ville de St Quentin," of which town his mother
</p>
<p>was also a native. There is little doubt, however,
</p>
<p>that they originally came from the small town of
</p>
<p>Bobeuf, or Baboeuf, in Picardy, in the present
</p>
<p>department of the Oise. This commune is stated
</p>
<p>to have been founded by a descendant of the
</p>
<p>family of Calvin, to have been peopled by a colony

</p>
<p>of Protestant refugees from various quarters, and
</p>
<p>to have maintained relations with other similar
</p>
<p>Calvinist colonies, all composed of peasant culti-
</p>
<p>vators.
</p>
<p>It is related of Babeuf s father that, on account
</p>
<p>of his abilities, he was in his younger days deputed
</p>
<p>by the members of the colony to undertake some
</p>
<p>negotiations in various foreign countries with a
</p>
<p>view to the union of the Lutheran and Calvinist
</p>
<p>sects, but his mission proving a failure, he took
</p>
<p>service in the troops of INIaria Theresa, where he
</p>
<p>attained the rank of major under the name of
</p>
<p>I'Epine Babeuf, and that he was subsequently
</p>
<p>appointed tutor to the children of Maria Theresa.
</p>
<p>It is further related that in after years the
</p>
<p>Emperor Joseph II., as he happened to be passing
</p>
<p>through Picardy, became acquainted with the son
</p>
<p>of his former major, the hero of this book, to whom
</p>
<p>he made the most brilliant offers of employment
</p>
<p>at the Court of Vienna. Francois Noel's severe
</p>
<p>democratic principles, even at that date, induced
</p>
<p>him resolutely to decline them. These details
</p>
<p>are taken from some manuscript notes respect-
</p>
<p>ing his youth, written by Babeuf at the close
</p>
<p>of his life. Considering the enthusiasm of the
</p>
<p>philosophic Emperor Joseph II. for the very same
</p>
<p>revolutionary ideas to which Babeuf himself was
</p>
<p>devoted, and his expressed intention, as related

</p>
<p>in these same memorial notes, of using his power
</p>
<p>ORIGIN AND YOUTH OF BABEUF 49
</p>
<p>to carry these ideas into effect, the rigid refusal of
</p>
<p>Babeuf to accept employment under him seems
</p>
<p>strange, and, taking all the circumstances into con-
</p>
<p>sideration, not a little improbable, more especially
</p>
<p>when we consider the immaturity of Babeufs
</p>
<p>revolutionary principles at that time. One is in-
</p>
<p>clined to suspect some exaggeration or distortion
</p>
<p>of the facts, probably unintentional, in Babeufs
</p>
<p>account of his relations with Joseph II.
</p>
<p>Babeuf speaks of his father, Claude Babeuf, as
</p>
<p>of a man " as proud as a Castilian, always count-
</p>
<p>ing himself rich and happy even in the midst of
</p>
<p>profound misery." He never, he says, " went to a
</p>
<p>wine shop, but delighted on rare occasions to don
</p>
<p>his soldier's uniform, which he carefully preserved,
</p>
<p>together with his formidable sabre, which he
</p>
<p>handled with the greatest ease and dexterity."
</p>
<p>He taught his son the elements of Latin, mathe-
</p>
<p>matics, and of the German language.
</p>
<p>When about fifteen years of age, Francois Noel
</p>
<p>entered the service, as junior clerk, of a land
</p>
<p>commissioner, who taught him land surveying.
</p>
<p>Two years later it is stated that he became attached
</p>
<p>to a landowner, near the small town of Roye in
</p>
<p>Picardy. The elder Babeuf appears to have died
</p>
<p>some time in 1781, and henceforth his mother
</p>
<p>and sisters became the charge of Francois Noel.
</p>
<p>He kept them for over sixteen years. Old Claude
</p>
<p>Babeuf, we are told, on his deathbed, handed

</p>
<p>to his son, as a last gift, a well-worn copy of
</p>
<p>Plutarch's Lives, telling him that the book had
</p>
<p>been his solace throughout the joys and sorrows
</p>
<p>of his life. He continued to press upon his son
</p>
<p>to study the lives of the great men of antiquity.
</p>
<p>" As for me," he went on to say, " I could have
</p>
<p>wished to have resembled Caius Gracchus, even
</p>
<p>though I were doomed to perish like him and his
</p>
<p>for the greatest of all causes, the cause of the
</p>
<p>common welfare ; but circumstances have not been
</p>
<p>favourable to the accomplishment of my designs."
</p>
<p>Expressing his conviction that his son would
</p>
<p>follow in his steps : " Swear," said he, " upon this
</p>
<p>sword, that has never yet departed from the path
</p>
<p>of honour, never to abandon the interests of the
</p>
<p>people, which are everything, and to pour out, if
</p>
<p>need be, the last drop of your blood to enlighten
</p>
<p>and defend this downtrodden race." The oath
</p>
<p>on the sword was taken as desired.
</p>
<p>On the 13th of November 1782, young Babeuf
</p>
<p>married one of the lady's maids of the Countess
</p>
<p>in whose husband's service he was. His wife was
</p>
<p>a native of Amiens, of poor parents, and seems to
</p>
<p>have been, to a great extent at least, illiterate.
</p>
<p>Babeuf afterwards called her " a woman of nature."
</p>
<p>Soon afterwards Babeuf found a position at Noyon
</p>
<p>in connection with land administration. The
</p>
<p>following year, after the birth of his first child, he

<p>again removed to the town of Roye, where he soon
</p>
<p>ORIGIN AND YOUTH OF BABEUF 51
</p>
<p>obtained a similar position as land-commissioner,^
</p>
<p>the highest he had yet held, which was confirmed
</p>
<p>to him by letters patent.
</p>
<p>At the age of twenty-five, Francois Noel Babeuf
</p>
<p>thus found himself in a position, not only fairly
</p>
<p>remunerative, but involving a certain social standing.
</p>
<p>He was by this time a prosperous father of a family,
</p>
<p>the head of an office, with clerks employed under
</p>
<p>him, and with leisure enough to devote himself
</p>
<p>to literary pursuits and public affairs. During
</p>
<p>these years Babeuf had relations with the Academie
</p>
<p>Royale des belles lettres at Arras. The Academy
</p>
<p>of Arras was one of the numerous literary societies
</p>
<p>that sprang up in the course of the eighteenth
</p>
<p>century in most French towns of any importance,
</p>
<p>one of the functions of which was to start com-
</p>
<p>petitions for the solution of given questions. As
</p>
<p>is well known, Rousseau's first important essay in
</p>
<p>literary composition was the attempted solution of
</p>
<p>a problem put forward for competition by a similar
</p>
<p>society at an earlier date.
</p>
<p>In 1785 the Arras Academy started the follow-
</p>
<p>ing question :  " Is it advantageous to reduce the
</p>
<p>number of roads in the territories of the villages of
</p>
<p>1 There seems to be some difficulty in ascertaining the status
</p>
<p>of Babeuf, or the precise nature of the office he held in the
</p>

<p>a breadth sufficient to enable them to be planted
</p>
<p>with trees ? Indicate, in the case of the affirmative,
</p>
<p>the means of effectuating such reduction." Babeuf
</p>
<p>was one of the first to enter the lists as candidate,
</p>
<p>and sent in his paper on the 25th November 1785.
</p>
<p>In spite of his practical knowledge of matters
</p>
<p>connected with the subject in question, the paper
</p>
<p>was among those rejected by the society. The
</p>
<p>incident, however, was the occasion of a friend-
</p>
<p>ship and correspondence, which lasted some years,
</p>
<p>with Dubois de Fosseux, the secretary of the
</p>
<p>society, who, twenty years older than Babeuf,
</p>
<p>came, in course of time, to seek his opinion on all
</p>
<p>subjects.
</p>
<p>Fosseux seemed to have been immediately
</p>
<p>struck with Babeufs capacity, and wrote him a
</p>
<p>friendly letter, suggesting he should continue his
</p>
<p>efforts to obtain recognition by the society. He,
</p>
<p>however, would not appear to have been^ person
</p>
<p>remarkable for tact  and proceeded, in the ensuing
</p>
<p>letters, to inflict upon Babeuf posers entirely out
</p>
<p>of the range of his line of thought, such as,
</p>
<p>"Why are negroes born black f" ' AVhich is
</p>
<p>the more happy in the social order, the sensitive
</p>
<p>man or the apathetic man { " and so forth. At
</p>
<p>the same time he loaded Babeuf with effusions of
</p>
<p>his own, poetical and otherwise. Notwithstanding

<p>the correspondents indulged in mutual flattery.

</p>
<p>they were not always in accord. Fosseux found
</p>
<p>some verses, sent to him by Babeuf, not fit to be
</p>
<p>read before ladies "with delicate nerves." To
</p>
<p>this the future Tribune of the people suggests
</p>
<p>that they might be furtively brought under the
</p>
<p>notice "of robust men, who might acquire fresh
</p>
<p>force from them."
</p>
<p>In March 1787 Babeuf makes an appeal to
</p>
<p>Fosseux to circulate a bi^ocliure entitled La Con-
</p>
<p>stitution du Corps-militaire en France, dans ses
</p>
<p>rapports avec celle du Gouvernement et avec le
</p>
<p>caractere National, of which he sends him a copy.
</p>
<p>He say^ that it is written by a person of his
</p>
<p>acquaintance, who was particularly anxious that
</p>
<p>it should be widely read in the town of Arras.
</p>
<p>The work was of a distinctly revolutionary char-
</p>
<p>acter, criticising severely the aristocratic caste-
</p>
<p>system of grades in the French army, by which
</p>
<p>all the higher positions were in the hands of
</p>
<p>courtiers and aristocrats ; and also advocates the
</p>
<p>convocation of an assembly of the people, to
</p>
<p>which the king should be responsible for his acts,
</p>
<p>and which should be the ultimate court of appeal.
</p>
<p>M., Advielle would attribute this little work to
</p>
<p>Babeuf himself; but, although this may be so, no
</p>
<p>conclusive evidence as to authorship is adducible.
</p>
<p>Fosseux acknowledges the receipt of the book, with
</p>
<p>compliments to the anonymous author, in his usual

<p>effusive style ; but a little later he writes " that it
</p>
<p>54 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>has been impossible for him to find anyone to
</p>
<p>undertake its distribution." "All our booksellers,"
</p>
<p>he says, " fear to compromise themselves with the
</p>
<p>police, and, in my capacity as sheriff, it would be
</p>
<p>equally unsuitable for me to become the distributor,
</p>
<p>since, from beginning to end, it does not cease to
</p>
<p>attack the government. For the rest, the work
</p>
<p>seems to me to be well put together, excellently
</p>
<p>written, and very interesting. I should be ex-
</p>
<p>tremely flattered to make the acquaintance of the
</p>
<p>author, who is assuredly a man of much spirit and
</p>
<p>merit. In these circumstances, JNIonsieur, and not
</p>
<p>having better fulfilled my commission, I feel bound
</p>
<p>to return to you the copy you confided to me. I
</p>
<p>have been well recompensed for the little trouble I
</p>
<p>have taken by the pleasure I have had in reading it."
</p>
<p>It is curious that in the very same letter in
</p>
<p>which he shirks the danger of helping to circulate
</p>
<p>La ConditutioJi du Corps-militaire, Fosseux is en-
</p>
<p>thusiastic over the project of a book bearing the
</p>
<p>title Le Changcment du monde entier. It was to
</p>
<p>be divided into six parts : the first to contain a
</p>
<p>detailed table of the misery afflicting the society of
</p>
<p>the day, "of the abuses, the disorders, the calamities,
</p>
<p>the wrongs, the injustices, the bankruptcies, the
</p>
<p>subjects of despair, the brigandages, the thefts, the
</p>
<p>assassinations, the crimes and horrors of all sorts,
</p>
<p>which take place " ; the second was to contain the

<p>cause of these evils ; the third, to expound principles
</p>
<p>ORIGIN AND YOUTH OF BABEUF 55
</p>
<p>and preliminary notions ; the fourth, the expedients,
</p>
<p>means, and regulations by which " all citizens who
</p>
<p>are in necessity, or who only enjoy a modest fortune,
</p>
<p>may, together ^vith their wives and children, be in
</p>
<p>the future well nourished, clothed, lighted, and
</p>
<p>warmed, receive a perfect education, and enjoy, by
</p>
<p>means of their honest labour, each according to his
</p>
<p>or her strength, abilities, sex, age, talent, trade, or
</p>
<p>profession, much more ease, liberty, justice, com-
</p>
<p>fort, and advantage than nowadays." The fifth
</p>
<p>section should deal with the means of procuring
</p>
<p>at once an adequate sum of money without the
</p>
<p>imposition of taxes on the peoples ! The sixth
</p>
<p>should consist of a reply to all objections.
</p>
<p>This syllabus, sketched out by Dubois de Fosseux,
</p>
<p>is not only noteworthy as showing the beginnings of
</p>
<p>Utopian Socialism, which had been already formu-
</p>
<p>lated in Morelly's Le Code de la nature, published
</p>
<p>in 1755, though at first attributed to Diderot. But
</p>
<p>what is especially interesting is the fact, that the
</p>
<p>Utopian scheme which so fascinated his friend
</p>
<p>Fosseux, in spite of its suggestion of the programme
</p>
<p>of the Equals of eight years later, does not seem
</p>
<p>to have attracted the future " people's tribune " at
</p>
<p>all at this time. Writing a little later, he treats
</p>
<p>the supposititious author of the scheme, who may
</p>
<p>well have been Fosseux himself, as "a mere
</p>
<p>dreamer."

<p>quaintance of a rich merchant named AudifFret,
</p>
<p>who proved a true friend to him, and to whose
</p>
<p>purse he had recourse when, later on, he found
</p>
<p>himself abandoned by everyone. At this time he
</p>
<p>started a work on the simplification of the land
</p>
<p>register, but it did not appear until three years
</p>
<p>later, when it was associated with the name of his
</p>
<p>friend AudifFret, who had doubtless contributed to
</p>
<p>defray the cost of publication. Writing to a pro-
</p>
<p>posal of one Lemoignan to reform the magistracy,
</p>
<p>about this time, Babeuf expresses himself as partisan
</p>
<p>of a unified code of law, which would once for all
</p>
<p>sweep away the chaos of medicEval customs and
</p>
<p>regulations, valid in one province and invalid in

<p>the next, and would "procure for all individuals

<p>indiscriminately, as regards the blessings and

<p>We may regard this and other expressions of

</p>
<p>ORIGIN AND YOUTH OF BABEUF 57
</p>
<p>wish that this should be done promptly, even
</p>
<p>though without accompanying letter. From what-
</p>
<p>ever reason, all relations between the two cor-
</p>
<p>respondents seem to have abruptly terminated
</p>
<p>at this time. Up to the present the future Tribune
</p>
<p>had not shown any marked signs of revolutionary
</p>
<p>sentiment or conviction, beyond a few expressions
</p>
<p>of opinion such as those above quoted  at least,
</p>
<p>unless we are to consider the Constitution militaire
</p>
<p>as coming from his pen.
</p>
<p>Babeuf, we gather, read but few papers, and
</p>
<p>these irregularly, amongst which are mentioned
</p>
<p>Le Mercure de France and the Journal de la
</p>
<p>langiie ff^anfaise. Neither, as far as we can
</p>
<p>see, was his other reading of a revolutionary
</p>
<p>character. Coming into contact, however, in the
</p>
<p>course of his professional duties, it may be men-
</p>
<p>tioned, with the king's Field-Marshal, the Comte
</p>
<p>de Casteja, who seems to have treated him with
</p>
<p>the haughtiness of the aristocrat of the ancien
</p>
<p>regime, Babeuf had a passage of arms with him, in
</p>
<p>which he defended himself with tact and dignity.
</p>
<p>The year before the outbreak of the Revolution
</p>
<p>found Babeuf at the zenith of his prosperity as a
</p>
<p>land-agent, with a considerable clientele among the

<p>nobility and clergy, all of them eager to avail

<p>themselves of his knowledge of land tenure and of

<p>this time he was charged by the Prior of St
</p>
<p>58 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>Taurin, a religious foundation in the neighbourhood
</p>
<p>of the town of Roye, to form an abstract of all
</p>
<p>the titles of the priory, together with all possible
</p>
<p>rights and privileges that could be invoked. The
</p>
<p>work occupied him six months. Shortly after, he
</p>
<p>also undertook important researches into the
</p>
<p>territorial archives of the Marquis de Soyecourt,
</p>
<p>one of the many nobles of the ancien regime who
</p>
<p>had exhausted his available substance in hanging
</p>
<p>round the court at Versailles, and who, in spite of
</p>
<p>his immense landed possessions, had at that time the
</p>
<p>not unusual aristocratic notoriety of not paying any-
</p>
<p>one, not even the innkeepers to whose houses he
</p>
<p>had resort on his travels. As might be expected,
</p>
<p>on the termination of his arduous labours, Babeuf
</p>
<p>found his bill of 12,000 livres (francs) disputed by
</p>
<p>his patron, who refused to hand over more than
</p>
<p>a hundred louis, a sum with which the creditor,
</p>
<p>hard driven as he was, and quite unable to risk the
</p>
<p>expenses of a lawsuit, had to be content. The
</p>
<p>affair absolutely ruined Babeuf, as it had occupied
</p>
<p>all his time for months, and had in consequence
</p>
<p>caused him to refuse several advantageous offers of
</p>
<p>other work. In this matter a certain influential
</p>
<p>family of the town of Roye, named Billecocq, had,
</p>
<p>it appears, been involved. The Billecocqs seem to
</p>
<p>have had an implacable hostility to Babeuf, whom

<p>they suspected of having done them an evil turn,

<p>CHAPTER II
</p>
<p>THE REVOLUTIONARY DRAMA OPENS
</p>
<p>Francois Noel Babeuf was still at Roye on the
</p>
<p>convocation of the States-General in May 1789.
</p>
<p>He had indeed been active at the Cahier of the
</p>
<p>district of Roye.^
</p>
<p>The first article from the pen of Babeuf, which
</p>
<p>proposed the abolition of feudal tenures, and the
</p>
<p>substitution of a single tax, irrespective of class, for
</p>
<p>the mass of existing imposts, local and national,
</p>
<p>was sufficient to extinguish his career as Commis-
</p>
<p>saire a Terrier. One of the Billecocqs, however,
</p>
<p>president of the committee for the reduction of
</p>
<p>the Cahiers, protested, with the result that Babeuf s
</p>
<p>motion was rejected.
</p>
<p>The first open revolutionary act of our hero
</p>
<p>appears to have been the part he took in procuring
</p>
<p>1 It is perhaps scarcely necessary to remind the I'eader that
</p>
<p>the Cahier was the statement of grievances, and the remedies
</p>
<p>demanded, which was drawn up by every township and baihwick
</p>
<p>throughout the territories of the French monarchy, by royal
</p>
<p>command, for the consideration of the States-General when they

</p>
<p>the destruction of the seigniorial archives of the
</p>
<p>neighbouring territories, which were publicly
</p>
<p>burned on the market-place at Roye : the details,
</p>
<p>however, of this transaction are wanting.
</p>
<p>In July 1789 Babeuf made a hurried visit to
</p>
<p>Paris, just in time to be present at the taking of
</p>
<p>the Bastille. The following day he returned to
</p>
<p>Roye, and on his way succeeded in delivering a
</p>
<p>noble, the Comte de Lauraguais, who was besieged
</p>
<p>in his castle by his tenants, after the manner of the
</p>
<p>time. Babeuf succeeded hi persuading the peasants
</p>
<p>to disperse. Among his papers was found a note
</p>
<p>claiming the Comte as a good patron and a friend
</p>
<p>of the people. In a few days he returned to Paris,
</p>
<p>presumably after having made his family arrange-
</p>
<p>ments, remaining in the capital until October.
</p>
<p>This residence in Paris finally converted the land-
</p>
<p>agent into a thoroughgoing partisan of revolu-
</p>
<p>tionary principles. Meanwhile the letters to his
</p>
<p>wife dealing with the events consequent on the
</p>
<p>fall of the Bastille are interesting. After describ-
</p>
<p>ing the parading of the head of Foulon on a pike
</p>
<p>in procession along the Faubourg St Martin, in the
</p>
<p>midst of a hundred thousand spectators, who greeted
</p>
<p>it with shouts of joy, he continues : " How ill that
</p>
<p>joy made me ! I was at the same time alike satisfied
</p>
<p>and ill content. I said, so much the better and so
</p>
<p>much the worse ! I understand that the people

<p>should do justice for itself; I approve of that justice

</p>
<p>so long as the destruction of the guilty suffices for it,
</p>
<p>but has it not to-day become cruel ? Punishments
</p>
<p>of all kinds  quartering, torture, the wheel, the
</p>
<p>stake, the whip, the gibbet, executions everywhere
</p>
<p> have demoralised us ! Our masters, instead of
</p>
<p>policing us, have made us barbarians, because they
</p>
<p>are such themselves. They reap, and will continue
</p>
<p>to reap, what they have sown. For all this, O my
</p>
<p>poor wife ! will have, as far as one can see, terrible
</p>
<p>consequences ! We are as yet only at the begin-
</p>
<p>ning ! " A truly significant forecast this.
</p>
<p>The main object of Babeuf's visit to Paris was,
</p>
<p>however, not political, but was for the purpose
</p>
<p>of getting further work in connection with land-
</p>
<p>agency. Babeuf was not long in coming to the con-
</p>
<p>clusion that the days of his metier, in the old sense
</p>
<p>at least, were numbered. He heard everywhere
</p>
<p>indications that the time of feudal chateaux, of
</p>
<p>seigniorial rights and ecclesiastical privileges, was at
</p>
<p>an end ; but he adds, " I am myself disposed, all the
</p>
<p>same, to put my shoulder to the wheel, to bring
</p>
<p>about that which would destroy my livelihood.
</p>
<p>Egoists would call me mad, but no matter ! "
</p>
<p>A further letter of the 16th August shows the
</p>
<p>state of impecuniosity in which his family were left.
</p>
<p>He also speaks of his working with M. Audiffret
</p>
<p>upon the land register before referred to. He
</p>
<p>further alludes to his hope of getting some employ-

<p>ment in Paris. At this time he published a small
</p>
<p>THE REVOLUTIONARY DRAMA 63
</p>
<p>pamphlet entitled, La nouvelle distinction des ordres
</p>
<p>par M. de Mirabeau. For Mirabeau, Babeuf
</p>
<p>appears to have had as great a dislike and distrust
</p>
<p>as that other tribune of the people, Jean Paul
</p>
<p>Marat.
</p>
<p>]Mean while, Babeuf s wife seems to have written
</p>
<p>him heartrending letters on the state of the family
</p>
<p>economically at Roye ; and we find that he has to
</p>
<p>ask assistance, in the shape of money borrowed
</p>
<p>from his friend M. AudifFret.
</p>
<p>Apart from the work in land registration before
</p>
<p>mentioned, Babeuf was already considerably occu-
</p>
<p>pied with AudifFret in connection with what is
</p>
<p>described as a new mathematical instrument called
</p>
<p>the Graphometre-Trigonometrique, to which was
</p>
<p>added, a little later, another instrument called the
</p>
<p>Cyclometre, designed to supplement the functioning
</p>
<p>of the former. The precise nature of these instru-
</p>
<p>ments it is impossible now to determine, though it
</p>
<p>appears they were intended to be used in land
</p>
<p>surveying. But, in any case, nothing seems to have
</p>
<p>come of the invention in the shape of profit to the
</p>
<p>inventors, and its subsequent fate rests in obscurity.
</p>
<p>At last the Cadastre perpetuel, which Babeuf had
</p>
<p>begun some years before, and which was a kind of
</p>
<p>"cast-ofF" of the territorial division and conditions
</p>
<p>of land tenure throughout France, was completed.

<p>of course, to the cutting up of the old French

</p>
<p>It may be mentioned that about this time
</p>
<p>Francois Noel took the additional name of Camille,
</p>
<p>for what reason it does not appear. His family
</p>
<p>still remained at Roye, and seem to have been left
</p>
<p>very much to themselves.
</p>
<p>The year 1790 was an active one for Babeuf.
</p>
<p>We find him in April at Xoyon, in May at St
</p>
<p>Quentin, and in July in Paris at the great fete
</p>
<p>of the Confederation. He was very diligent in
</p>
<p>his adopted town of Roye during this year,
</p>
<p>drawing up petitions to the Assembly, and re-
</p>
<p>dacting the proclamations of the municipal council.
</p>
<p>He appears to have come into collision, notwith-
</p>
<p>standing, with the municipality respecting a
</p>
<p>pamphlet claiming taxation according to means,
</p>
<p>which he was accused of having had printed and
</p>
<p>circulated by the official machinery of the muni-
</p>
<p>cipality without its authorisation.
</p>
<p>He also agitated among the cabaretiers (wine-
</p>
<p>shop keepers), urging them to resist their taxa-
</p>
<p>tion, and had in consequence a decree of arrest
</p>
<p>launched against him, w^hich, however, was not
</p>
<p>acted upon. His local popularity was now be-
</p>

</p>
<p>continuance of his old profession impossible in the
</p>
<p>district. He now definitely abandoned his old
</p>
<p>means of livelihood, and started upon a career of
</p>
<p>political journalism, founding, with a friend who
</p>
<p>was a printer at Noyon, a journal, having for its
</p>
<p>title Le Correspondant Picard. Forty numbers in
</p>
<p>all appeared, and, according to a statement of his,
</p>
<p>brought him two hundred lawsuits in six months !
</p>
<p>A certain strict patriot took Babeuf severely to
</p>
<p>task for calling his journal Le Coii'espondant
</p>
<p>Picard, objecting that there was no longer a
</p>
<p>Picardy, the new regime only recognising the
</p>
<p>departments of the Somme, Oise, and Aisne. The
</p>
<p>paper, it is needless to say, was nevertheless
</p>
<p>thoroughly revolutionary, and was not wanting in
</p>
<p>the profusion of classical allusions and references to
</p>
<p>Roman history so characteristic of the time.
</p>
<p>Probably in the above-mentioned lawsuits was in-
</p>
<p>cluded a criminal prosecution for one of his articles
</p>
<p>in connection with which we find him in prison at
</p>
<p>the beginning of July 1790. He was released,
</p>
<p>however, in time to take part in the festival of
</p>
<p>the Federation, the anniversary of the taking of
</p>
<p>the Bastille, the 14th of July, owing to the
</p>
<p>pressure brought to bear on the authorities by

<p>Accused by an aristocrat of being a turncoat, of
</p>
<p>having become the most vehement enemy of every
</p>
<p>remnant of the feudal system after having gained
</p>
<p>his hving as a feudaHst and a seigniorial agent,
</p>
<p>Babeuf replied, that in his youth he did not reason ;
</p>
<p>since then he had believed that all that was ought
</p>
<p>to be  that it was absolutely necessary that there
</p>
<p>should be persecutors and persecuted ; until recently,
</p>
<p>therefore, he stood in awe of his "mother, the
</p>
<p>feudal system," but since he had become a man,
</p>
<p>since " the sun of the Revolution " had enlightened
</p>
<p>him, he perceived that this mother was a " hydra
</p>
<p>with a hundred heads."
</p>
<p>Neither his journal nor any other occupation
</p>
<p>that he then had proved sufficient to keep Babeuf
</p>
<p>and his family in the necessaries of life. Hence, in
</p>
<p>September 1792, he was glad to accept the post
</p>
<p>offered him of administrator and archivist of the
</p>
<p>department of the Somme, and he finally left
</p>
<p>Roye. His position brought him to Amiens, where
</p>
<p>he settled down for the time being, but where he
</p>
<p>found a formidable rival from Roye, a representative
</p>
<p>of the people, a certain Andre Dumonge. The
</p>
<p>rivalry developed into a quarrel between the two
</p>
<p>men, in which Babeuf got the worst of it and had to
</p>
<p>leave. He succeeded, notwithstanding, in obtain-
</p>
<p>ing a similar if somewhat inferior post in the district
</p>
<p>of Montdidier. Here, however, he was still more

<p>unfortunate than at Amiens. The president of the

</p>
<p>district was an extreme royalist and aristocrat,
</p>
<p>whom, it was said, though the details are want-
</p>
<p>ing, Babeuf saved on one occasion from the
</p>
<p>fury of the populace. Whether this be true or
</p>
<p>not, the man seems to have nourished a personal
</p>
<p>grudge against Babeuf, either from political or
</p>
<p>private reasons, and to have only waited for an
</p>
<p>opportunity of serving him a bad turn. Babeuf
</p>
<p>found himself accused one day of having substituted
</p>
<p>one name for another in an act of sale of one of the
</p>
<p>national lands ; for his position involved a great
</p>
<p>amount of work in connection with the repartition
</p>
<p>and sale of the nationalised property of the Church.
</p>
<p>Babeuf immediately repaired to Amiens to justify
</p>
<p>himself for what was undoubtedly due to an
</p>
<p>accidental negligence, but there he was at once
</p>
<p>arrested on the charge of forgery in connection
</p>
<p>with the affair. Probably aware that he was not
</p>
<p>likely to have a fair trial, Babeuf profited by an
</p>
<p>opportunity which offered itself for escape from
</p>
<p>his ffaolers. The trial continued all the same, and
</p>
<p>many months later, on the 23rd of August 1793,
</p>
<p>Babeuf was condemned, in contumaciam, to twenty
</p>
<p>years' penal servitude.
</p>
<p>He had, however, fled to Paris, whence he writes,
</p>
<p>under date 24th February 1794, relating the steps
</p>
<p>he was taking with the minister concerned, with a
</p>
<p>view to saving his honour. He justly ridicules the

</p>
<p>absurdity of the accusation of his having made
</p>
<p>68 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>money by forgery, calling to witness the indigence
</p>
<p>of himself and his family. He states that an
</p>
<p>American named Fournier is giving him a little
</p>
<p>literary work ; that he is also undertaking the
</p>
<p>presentation of a petition for the said Fournier.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Babeufs family, that he had left at
</p>
<p>jNlontdidier, were indeed in terrible straits, every-
</p>
<p>where in debt, with clamorous creditors on all
</p>
<p>sides. On the 6th of ^larch we find Mme. Babeuf
</p>
<p>compelled to compound for her liabilities by
</p>
<p>abandoning the whole of her furniture.
</p>
<p>Just at this time, however. Babeuf again suc-
</p>
<p>ceeded in obtaining an appointment, on this occasion
</p>
<p>in connection with the Commune of Paris, as
</p>
<p>secretary to the Administration of Subsistence.
</p>
<p>His wife and family now came to join him in Paris.
</p>
<p>At the Bureau des Subsistances, on which he was
</p>
<p>engaged, Babeuf discovered a great deal of pecula-
</p>
<p>tion, or at least a gi'eat deal of leakage in the
</p>
<p>accounts. This may well have been the work of
</p>
<p>subordinates, and unknown to the authorities.
</p>
<p>Babeuf, however, got it into his head that it was
</p>
<p>the result of a conspiracy on the part of those in
</p>
<p>high places to produce an artificial famine. He
</p>
<p>thereupon denounced certain prominent persons to
</p>
<p>the Paris sections, and the latter ordered the publica-
</p>
<p>tion of the reports of Babeuf, and an investigation
</p>
<p>into the charges through a commission, which was,

</p>
<p>however, suppressed by the government {i.e. the
</p>
<p>THE REVOLUTIONARY DRAMA 69
</p>
<p>Committee of Public Safety). The many influential
</p>
<p>enemies he had raised up in Paris in connection
</p>
<p>with this affair were probably responsible for the
</p>
<p>speedy success of the Montdidier authorities in
</p>
<p>obtaining his arrest, with a view to his being
</p>
<p>delivered over to them as a prisoner.
</p>
<p>Babeuf, his wife and family, now lived at 27 Porte
</p>
<p>St Honord. It was here that he was arrested,
</p>
<p>and, together with the clerks of the Bureau des
</p>
<p>Subsistances, imprisoned in the Abbaye. Babeuf
</p>
<p>himself was some weeks later sent to take his trial
</p>
<p>before the criminal tribunal of the Aisne on the
</p>
<p>old charge of forgery, but on a fresh indictment.
</p>
<p>On the 28th Floreal (18th of July 1794), however,
</p>
<p>the judges of the supreme tribunal of the Aisne,
</p>
<p>at Laon, on examination of the evidence, unani-
</p>
<p>mously declared that there was no case on which
</p>
<p>to proceed against the accused. Thus Babeufs
</p>
<p>honour was finally rehabilitated. The whole
</p>
<p>business would seem to have been originally plotted
</p>
<p>by various political and personal enemies of Babeuf
</p>
<p>in Picardy. Several royalist members of the Roye
</p>
<p>municipal council appear to have been implicated.
</p>
<p>Add to this, that the friends of various emigrant
</p>
<p>aristocrats from the district of JNIontdidier, whose
</p>
<p>domains were therefore forfeited to the nation, were
</p>
<p>naturally anxious to throw every obstacle they could
</p>
<p>in the way of their partition and sale, while the

<p>commissioner Babeuf was not less zealous in his
</p>
<p>70 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>determination to bring to naught their aristocratic
</p>
<p>intrigues to rob the nation of its newly acquired
</p>
<p>property.
</p>
<p>After his acquittal, Babeuf returned to Paris
</p>
<p>at the time that Robespierre was still remain-
</p>
<p>ing in power. Here, however, he seems to have
</p>
<p>been content to "lie low" politically, thereby
</p>
<p>escaping the unpleasant attentions of Robespierre
</p>
<p>and his committee. A short time later we find
</p>
<p>him back at Laon, where his son Emile was lying
</p>
<p>dangerously ill. He was at Laon when the news
</p>
<p>of the Revolution of the 9th Thermidor, ann. II.
</p>
<p>(27th of July 1794), and the fall of Robespierre,
</p>
<p>reached him. Babeuf, on finding the turn things
</p>
<p>had taken, returned immediately to Paris, where he
</p>
<p>started his Journal de la liberie de la jjresse, in
</p>
<p>which he vehemently attacked the fallen govern-
</p>
<p>ment, and the system of the Terror generally, in the
</p>
<p>interests of the Thermidoreans, though it was not
</p>
<p>long before he began to attack the latter as vehe-
</p>
<p>mently as the former. In this way, as we shall see,
</p>
<p>Babeuf stirred up fresh enemies against himself,
</p>
<p>and before long landed himself once more in gaol.

<p>CHAPTER III
</p>
<p>VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE AND RIPENING
</p>
<p>OF IDEAS
</p>
<p>As already stated, shortly after the fall of Robes-
</p>
<p>pierre, Babeuf reappeared in Paris and founded
</p>
<p>the Journal de la liberie de la presse, in which
</p>
<p>he played the part of political free lance, attacking
</p>
<p>in turn the Robespierrists and the Thermidoreans.
</p>
<p>At first, however, the whole of his energies seem
</p>
<p>to have been directed against the party of Robes-
</p>
<p>pierre and the old revolutionary government. He
</p>
<p>was indeed at this time on terms of intimacy
</p>
<p>with several of the Thermidorean leaders, notably
</p>
<p>Tallien and Fouche, who subsequently became his
</p>
<p>bitter enemies. Before long, however, his general
</p>
<p>journalistic attitude caused the absurd suspicion
</p>
<p>to fall upon him of being a royalist agent in
</p>
<p>disguise. This was enhanced by his public speak-
</p>
<p>ing, at which he now became very assiduous, more
</p>
<p>particularly in the club of his quarter, where he
</p>
<p>nightly attacked the authority of the Convention,
</p>
<p>and especially the leading Thermidoreans. In this

<p>way Babeuf made himself the enemy ahke of the
</p>
<p>Jacobins and of the parties now dominant in the
</p>
<p>Convention. The former were incensed by a
</p>
<p>pamphlet issued by him at this time, Du systeme
</p>
<p>de depopulation ou la vie et les crimes de Carrier,
</p>
<p>in which the methods of Carrier, his noyades,
</p>
<p>republican marriages, etc., were denounced in the
</p>
<p>most violent language.
</p>
<p>The journal itself was consecrated to the cause
</p>
<p>implied by its name, and, as already stated, al-
</p>
<p>though first directed mainly against the " tail of
</p>
<p>Robespierre,"' as the partisans of the fallen dictator
</p>
<p>were now termed, soon took to criticising with
</p>
<p>equal severity the successful faction in the recent
</p>
<p>struggle. The tenth number merits notice, inas-
</p>
<p>much as Babeuf reproduced therein the address of
</p>
<p>the popular society of Arras to the National
</p>
<p>Convention, containing a kind of manifesto on the
</p>
<p>liberty of the press, coupled with a denunciation
</p>
<p>of Barere, the notorious ex-member of the Com-
</p>
<p>mittee of Public Safety. As is well known, it was
</p>
<p>drawn up by Babeuf himself. It concluded with the
</p>
<p>words: " Men of the 9th of Thermidor, we declare be-
</p>
<p>fore you, on behalf of our fellow-citizens, that they,
</p>
<p>deadened by a long lethargy, demand their freedom,

<p>claiming that the fall of tyrants shall render to

<p>who have muzzled that devouring ogre, whose
</p>
<p>furies have desolated our country during five
</p>
<p>months, will prove themselves raised to your level,
</p>
<p>in denouncing to you the revolutionary phantom

<p>behind which Joseph Lebon has sheltered himself,
</p>
<p>in order to battle victoriously against the victims
</p>
<p>who struggle to escape his fury. We denounce to
</p>
<p>you Barere, that vile slave of Robespierre." The
</p>
<p>document proceeds to stigmatise, in a few phrases,
</p>
<p>the horrors of " the Terror " as exercised at Arras.
</p>
<p>The above, in the oratorical manner of the time,
</p>
<p>is a good specimen of Babeuf's writing, in what
</p>
<p>we may term the " grand" style of manifesto. The
</p>
<p>journal from the first excited the adverse attention
</p>
<p>of the authorities, and it had been published little
</p>
<p>more than two months before the violence of its
</p>
<p>language caused action to be taken by the " Com-
</p>
<p>mittee of General Security," and on the 13th of
</p>
<p>October 1794 an attempt was made to stop the
</p>
<p>paper and seize the person of Babeuf. Warned
</p>
<p>in time, however, he succeeded in hiding himself,
</p>
<p>and what is more, from a secret retreat, in pub-
</p>
<p>lishing his paper under a new title. It now
</p>
<p>appeared as the Tribun du Peuple. Otherwise it
</p>
<p>remained unchanged, either in shape or character,
</p>
<p>being avowedly the continuation of the original
</p>
<p>enterprise.
</p>
<p>It is to be remarked that a notable change

</p>
<p>began about this time to take place in the
</p>
<p>74 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>opinions of Babeuf in regard to the old revolu-
</p>
<p>tionary^ leaders and their policy. He no longer
</p>
<p>attacked them indiscriminately. We give Babeuf s
</p>
<p>opinion of Robespierre at this turning-point of
</p>
<p>his career. "This Robespierre," he says, "whose
</p>
<p>memory to-day is unjustly abhorred, this Robes-
</p>
<p>pierre is one in whom we must distinguish
</p>
<p>two persons  Robespierre the sincere patriot, a
</p>
<p>friend of just principles dowTi to 1793, and Robes-
</p>
<p>pierre the ambitious tjTant, and the worst of
</p>
<p>criminals since that epoch. This Robespierre, I
</p>
<p>say, so long as he was a citizen, is perhaps the
</p>
<p>best source in which to seek great truths and
</p>
<p>powerful arguments for the rights of the press."
</p>
<p>He goes on to point out that the declaration of
</p>
<p>the Rights of Man the nation really owes to
</p>
<p>Robespierre. " We cannot fail to esteem the
</p>
<p>work," he continues, " though we forget the work-
</p>
<p>man," or ^rather, as he had already said, " let us dis-
</p>
<p>tinguish between Robespierre the apostle of liberty,
</p>
<p>and Robespierre the most infamous of tyrants ! "
</p>
<p>During this time the paper seems to have
</p>
<p>appeared mostly without the printer's name,
</p>
<p>though the deputy GufFroy was undoubtedly the
</p>
<p>printer of several numbers. Number 33 never
</p>
<p>appeared, the manuscript having been seized by

<p>the authorities. It contained a violent attack of

<p>dorean reaction. All this time the poHce were
</p>
<p>VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE 75
</p>
<p>unable to lay hands upon Babeuf himself, but, in
</p>
<p>revenge, they were zealous in arresting the dis-
</p>
<p>tributors of the journal. Amongst these was one
</p>
<p>Anne Treillard, who played a leading part in the
</p>
<p>distribution. This woman was subjected to a
</p>
<p>close interrogation as to the whereabouts of
</p>
<p>Babeuf. She denied all knowledge of his domi-
</p>
<p>cile, and stated that he himself brought her the
</p>
<p>packages containing the numbers to a place in the
</p>
<p>Jardin de I'Egalite. Asked if she would know
</p>
<p>Babeuf if she saw him, she replied that she had
</p>
<p>never observed him closely, but that he was of
</p>
<p>medium stature, with a long, thin, serious-looking
</p>
<p>face. Asked, still further, where the first numbers
</p>
<p>were sold, she replied that they were fetched from
</p>
<p>somewhere near the Place des Piques, and that it
</p>
<p>was from thence that the Journal de la Uberte de
</p>
<p>la presse had been sent out.
</p>
<p>By an irony of fate, it was his recent friend
</p>
<p>Tallien who had now become the sworn enemy of
</p>
<p>the late revolutionary government and of Jacobin
</p>
<p>principles generally, and whom Babeuf had also
</p>
<p>attacked in his journal, who was the instrument of
</p>
<p>obtaining Babeuf's arrest. In a speech in the
</p>
<p>Convention on this occasion, TalHen denounced
</p>
<p>Babeuf as the tool of Fouche, whose enemy Tallien
</p>
<p>had now become. It was the 10th of Pluviose,
</p>

<p>ground of his having outraged the national repre-
</p>
<p>sentation in his articles. The Convention giving
</p>
<p>its consent, the arrest was effected by the executive
</p>
<p>authorities a few days later.
</p>
<p>Owing to the hints obtained from the woman
</p>
<p>Anne Treillard, the committee, acting presumably
</p>
<p>on the motion carried by Tallien before the Con-
</p>
<p>vention a fortnight before, succeeded by means
</p>
<p>of its police in discovering and seizing Babeuf
</p>
<p>on the 12th of February 1795. While in prison,
</p>
<p>their victim, however, was successful in smuggling
</p>
<p>out and getting distributed a manifesto entitled
</p>
<p>" Babeuf, the Tribune of the People, to his Fellow-
</p>
<p>Citizens." It consisted in a vigorous defence of
</p>
<p>his public and private conduct, not forgetting the
</p>
<p>affair at Montdidier. But it was without effect,
</p>
<p>for, together with other members of his staff, a
</p>
<p>few days later he was conveyed from Paris to
</p>
<p>Arras, where the imprisonment was continued.
</p>
<p>It should be noted, as regards this, that Babeuf and
</p>
<p>his colleagues were imprisoned in a purely arbitrary
</p>
<p>manner, as no definite charge had been formulated
</p>
<p>against them, and no idea of a trial at any definite
</p>
<p>time seems to have been even entertained, as it
</p>
<p>certainly never took place.
</p>
<p>Babeuf's companions in the prison at Arras
</p>
<p>were Lebois, the editor of Le Journal de legalite ;

<p>the days of the Correspondant Picard, who had
</p>
<p>VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE 77
</p>
<p>been arrested as a partisan of the Terror in his
</p>
<p>native town of St Omer; and Cochet, also a
</p>
<p>native of St Omer, who was doubtless in gaol for
</p>
<p>the same reason. There were other partisans of
</p>
<p>the fallen party of the Mountain, who subse-
</p>
<p>quently joined Babeufs movement, and who were
</p>
<p>detained in another prison at Arras. Already,
</p>
<p>in 1787, in a letter to his old correspondent
</p>
<p>Dubois de Fosseux, Babeuf indicates that his
</p>
<p>mind was occupied with the question of the
</p>
<p>communisation of the land and the products of
</p>
<p>industry, but at that time it was in the form
</p>
<p>of a problem only. It was in the prison of
</p>
<p>Arras, singularly enough, the town where his old
</p>
<p>correspondent resided, that the root ideas of the
</p>
<p>communism subsequently embodied in the pro-
</p>
<p>gramme of the Equals of the year V. were first
</p>
<p>definitely formulated. The first impulse, or at all
</p>
<p>events the fii'st definite notion of communism as the
</p>
<p>economic ideal of human society, seems to have
</p>
<p>been derived by Babeuf from a study of Morelly's
</p>
<p>work, Le Code de la nature et le veritable esprit
</p>
<p>de ses lois de tout temps neglige ou inconnu.
</p>
<p>This work of JMorelly, an obscure author of
</p>
<p>whom little is known, was written about 1755,
</p>
<p>and seems to have had a certain vogue for a time,
</p>
<p>probably in part owing to the fact that it was for
</p>
<p>long attributed to Diderot. The work of Morelly

</p>
<p>was undoubtedly, both intrinsically and in effect,
</p>
<p>78 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>the most important of the precursors, not only of
</p>
<p>Babouvism, but of the Utopian SociaHsm of the
</p>
<p>early nineteenth century ; its influence, either direct
</p>
<p>or indirect, on Fourier and Cabet being specially
</p>
<p>noticeable. In accordance with eighteenth-century
</p>
<p>anthropology, Morelly starts with the classical
</p>
<p>notion of the " golden age," which he deduces from
</p>
<p>the theory that the primitive instincts of all men
</p>
<p>are good. The present state of inequality and its
</p>
<p>accompanying human misery is due, not to any
</p>
<p>intrinsic defect in human nature, but to the insti-
</p>
<p>tution of private property. It was the inroads of
</p>
<p>the latter upon the communism originally reigning
</p>
<p>among the children of men that was the source
</p>
<p>and fountain of all evil. So soon as individuals
</p>
<p>began to use more than their share of the common
</p>
<p>goods, then began all the miseries that had afflicted
</p>
<p>mankind.
</p>
<p>Morelly accepted the principle of Helvetius,
</p>
<p>that the root of all conduct was self-love, but
</p>
<p>argued that, since no man can be happy by
</p>
<p>himself alone without the aid of his fellow-men,
</p>
<p>recognition of the claims of others  in other
</p>
<p>words, moral rectitude  is the only certain means
</p>
<p>of promoting one's own happiness. As a direct
</p>
<p>consequence of this principle, Morelly insisted
</p>
<p>upon the common ownership of all wealth, and
</p>
<p>the equal enjoyment of the good things of life
</p>
<p>by all alike. It is curious that this old eighteenth-

<p>century writer seems to have been the first to
</p>
<p>put forward the subsequently well-known maxim
</p>
<p>" from each according to his abilities, to each accord-
</p>
<p>ing to his needs." He undoubtedly made this the
</p>
<p>basis of his social construction. For his scheme
</p>
<p>is plainly built throughout upon this principle.
</p>
<p>The only advantage accruing to talent is, according
</p>
<p>to Morelly's system, to be the honour of directing
</p>
<p>the industiy and the affairs of the community in
</p>
<p>general. The natural products of different districts
</p>
<p>are the paths from one to the other, by a natural
</p>
<p>system of exchange, founded upon mutual accom-
</p>
<p>modation.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Morelly's conviction of the
</p>
<p>intrinsic goodness of human nature, coercion is
</p>
<p>assumed as necessary, to prevent the backsliding
</p>
<p>of indi\ddual members of the new society. Strong
</p>
<p>fortresses are spoken of in deserted places where
</p>
<p>criminal or recalcitrant persons are to be confined
</p>
<p>for a time, or, in extreme cases, for life. As re-
</p>
<p>gards marriage, Morelly insists that every citizen
</p>
<p>who has attained to man's estate shall be com-
</p>
<p>pelled to marry. Celibacy is only to be allowed
</p>
<p>after the fortieth year has been attained. At
</p>
<p>the beginning of every year the festival of
</p>
<p>marriage is to be celebrated for all those who
</p>
<p>have attained the requisite age. ' The young
</p>
<p>persons of both sexes will be gathered together,

<p>and, in presence of the senate of the city, every
</p>
<p>80 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>youth will choose the maiden that pleases him,
</p>
<p>and as soon as he has received her consent,
</p>
<p>will take her to wife." The first marriage is
</p>
<p>to be indissoluble during ten years. Afterwards
</p>
<p>divorce is to be allowed, by consent of both, or
</p>
<p>even on the demand of one only, of the parties
</p>
<p>concerned. The divorced persons are not to be
</p>
<p>allowed to marry again before the expiration of
</p>
<p>one year, and they will not be permitted to be
</p>
<p>reunited to each other under any circumstances.
</p>
<p>They cannot marry younger persons than them-
</p>
<p>selves, or than the divorced partner of the original
</p>
<p>marriage. Only widows and widowers are to have
</p>
<p>this liberty.
</p>
<p>As might be expected, there are traces of the
</p>
<p>influence of the first, and, for a long time, sole
</p>
<p>exponent of Utopianism  Thomas JNIore. As
</p>
<p>already stated, many of Fourier's specific doctrines
</p>
<p>are anticipated by JNIorelly, e.g. that the moral
</p>
<p>world is governed by civil laws, as the physical
</p>
<p>is by natural laws. In the physical world, argues
</p>
<p>Morelly, power of attraction, i.e. gravitation, is
</p>
<p>dominant ; in the moral world, the place of gravi-
</p>
<p>tation is supplied by that of self-love. There is also
</p>
<p>a strong analogy between the "city" of Morelly and
</p>
<p>the phalanstere of Fourier. The division of the
</p>
<p>various elements of society on a fixed mechanical
</p>
<p>and arithmetical scheme, founded on a decimal

<p>basis, so characteristic of Fourier, is also note-

<p>worthy in INIorelly. Even Fourier's description
</p>
<p>of the arrangement of his ideal phalanstere bears
</p>
<p>unmistakable traces of Morelly's work. According
</p>
<p>to the latter, in the centre of the city is to be a
</p>
<p>great open space, surrounded by storehouses and
</p>
<p>pubhc buildings ; surrounding these, again, are to
</p>
<p>be the dwellings of the citizens ; farther away, the
</p>
<p>buildings in which industrial operations are carried
</p>
<p>on ; still further away are the dwelling-places of
</p>
<p>the peasantry, together with the farm buildings.
</p>
<p>But these details, interesting as they are in view
</p>
<p>of the later developments of Utopian Socialism,
</p>
<p>have no special significance or importance for the
</p>
<p>movement inaugurated by Babeuf. The chief
</p>
<p>thing in this connection is the importance of the
</p>
<p>influence of Morelly's book in furnishing the
</p>
<p>groundwork for the definite communistic principles
</p>
<p>of the Society of the Equals. These ideas ripened
</p>
<p>in Babeuf's mind undoubtedly, and, through him,
</p>
<p>in those of his associates, during their imprisonment
</p>
<p>at Arras, early in the year 1795. Outside, the
</p>
<p>party of the Mountain and the Jacobins were
</p>
<p>throughout France at this time a defeated and
</p>
<p>a persecuted faction.
</p>
<p>Communistic ideas, properly so called, though
</p>
<p>undoubtedly present in a loose and vague way
</p>
<p>in the minds of individual members of the old

<p>revolutionary party, were never formally recognised

<p>was a party of the small middle-class, and the
</p>
<p>small independent master-workman, who economi-
</p>
<p>cally at this time formed part of that class. Hence
</p>
<p>it represented, as such, economically, the interests
</p>
<p>of the small property-holder as against the feudal
</p>
<p>landlord, and all that appertained to him, in the
</p>
<p>first place ; and in the second place, as against the
</p>
<p>new wealthy manufacturer, contractor, and man
</p>
<p>of finance. But the proletariat, as we understand
</p>
<p>it to-day, was too young and immature to have,
</p>
<p>strictly speaking, a definite class-consciousness of
</p>
<p>its own, still less determinate principles of political
</p>
<p>action. Nevertheless, so far as it was possible,
</p>
<p>Babeuf s new movement constituted for the moment
</p>
<p>the rallying-point, as for a last effort, of all the
</p>
<p>revolutionary sections of the French people.
</p>
<p>The formation of a new class of wealthy
</p>
<p>bourgeois to step into the place economically and
</p>
<p>politically of the displaced feudal aristocracy had
</p>
<p>already begun. It was already evident that the

<p>aim of the Thermidorean leaders, i.e. of those
</p>
<p>who had been instrumental in the overthrow of
</p>
<p>Robespierre and of the old revolutionary regime,
</p>
<p>was to place themselves at the head of such a new
</p>
<p>aristocracy of wealth. The process of the formation
</p>
<p>and consolidation of this new monied class was, as
</p>
<p>we all know, completed under the regime of the

<p>system of the Terror. It dates, indeed, really from
</p>
<p>long before, in fact from the end of 1789, when the
</p>
<p>first sale of the nationalised ecclesiastical lands
</p>
<p>took place.
</p>
<p>Syndicates were formed to compete with private
</p>
<p>indi\dduals in the scramble for the landed pro-
</p>
<p>perty of the Church. As only a small percentage
</p>
<p>of the purchase-money had to be paid at once,
</p>
<p>the way of the astute speculator was smoothed for
</p>
<p>him. In the not unfounded hopes of evading the
</p>
<p>payment of the second instalment, many of these
</p>
<p>adventurers favoured the Revolution, and were
</p>
<p>specially eager in urging on the Austrian war.
</p>
<p>After the overthrow of the monarchy on the 10th
</p>
<p>of August 1792 it was decided that the lands of
</p>
<p>the emigrant nobles should be sold only in small
</p>
<p>lots, and not m huge sections, as had been the case
</p>
<p>with the ecclesiastical lands.
</p>
<p>Here we see the effects of the new revolutionary
</p>
<p>regime, in which the influence of the small middle
</p>
<p>and working class was dominant. The speculators
</p>
<p>and financiers were for the moment cowed. But
</p>
<p>this did not prevent these same speculators and
</p>
<p>jobbers, during the ensuing winter, from evading
</p>
<p>the law and making money, by means of sham sales
</p>
<p>and other arts of trickery, out of the costly furniture
</p>
<p>and movable effects of the fugitive nobles. But

<p>of the lands themselves remained unefFected so
</p>
<p>84 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>long as the " moderate " party of the Girondins
</p>
<p>continued to be the official repositories of political
</p>
<p>power. After their fall, the sale of the lands was
</p>
<p>definitely ordered on the conditions already de-
</p>
<p>scribed. But the decree of the Convention was
</p>
<p>again hampered in its execution owing to the
</p>
<p>intervention of the second great campaign against
</p>
<p>the coalition of Europe of the autumn of 1793.
</p>
<p>France became for the nonce a "gigantic armed
</p>
<p>camp," and the one thought was the national
</p>
<p>defence. But though few transfers, in the sense in-
</p>
<p>tended, were made, this did not prevent individual
</p>
<p>agents of the government from improving the
</p>
<p>situation to their own advantage by sales which
</p>
<p>evaded the conditions imposed. Two-thirds of the
</p>
<p>houses in Paris had now become national property.
</p>
<p>Finally, the Committee of Public Safety, early
</p>
<p>in 1794, while ordering the sale of the confis-
</p>
<p>cated lands to be continued with greater despatch
</p>
<p>than heretofore, and while advising the principle
</p>
<p>of partition on a small scale should be adhered to
</p>
<p>as far as possible, did not make the latter an
</p>
<p>absolute sine qua non, the result being that the

<p>victuallers of the army and the contractors for war
</p>
<p>material generally, who had become suddenly rich
</p>
<p>by the malpractices usual with their tribe, had
</p>
<p>succeeded in annexing considerable tracts of French

</p>
<p>the hocussing of the currency by the issuing of a

<p>limitless mass of a practically worthless paper.
</p>
<p>These and other forms of robbery on the part of
</p>
<p>the new financial middle-class flourished still more
</p>
<p>exceedingly during the heyday of this class  the
</p>
<p>period of the Consulate and Empire. It was, then,
</p>
<p>this new middle-class which from the Revolution of
</p>
<p>Thermidor onwards gave intellectual, moral, and
</p>
<p>political tone to French life. The active opposition
</p>
<p>to their sway was constituted by the remains of
</p>
<p>the old revolutionary party, which were momentarily
</p>
<p>gathered together in the movement of which our
</p>
<p>Francois Noel, or Gracchus, Babeuf, as he now
</p>
<p>called himself, was the life and soul.
</p>
<p>Babeuf himself alludes in his famous 43rd number

<p>of the Tribun to the object-lesson as to the turn

<p>things were taking, such as "he that runs could

</p>
<p>friend of Danton, had come into possession of a
</p>
<p>large estate, which he kept up at vast expense.
</p>
<p>During the five revolutionary^ years before the 9th
</p>
<p>of Thermidor the issue of paper money [assignats),
</p>
<p>although disastrous enough in its economic effects,
</p>
<p>was nevertheless kept within bounds, and. it has
</p>
<p>been computed, amounted to not more than seven
</p>
<p>milliards. A certain relative proportion between
</p>
<p>the guarantee security and the paper money was
</p>
<p>never quite lost sight of during all the issues dating
</p>
<p>from before the fall of Robespierre. It was only
</p>
<p>under the reaction which set in shortly after the
</p>
<p>last event that all idea of proportion was cast to
</p>
<p>the winds in favour of absolutely reckless swindling.
</p>
<p>While, as above said, during the first five years of
</p>
<p>the Revolution, it has been estimated that at most
</p>
<p>seven milliards of paper was issued^ within two
</p>
<p>years following July 1794, the amount of paper
</p>
<p>poured into circulation has been reckoned to have
</p>
<p>been not less than thirty-eight milliards ; of which
</p>
<p>thirty milliards belong to the first six months of
</p>
<p>the Constitution of the year III., that is, to the
</p>
<p>Government of the Directory.
</p>
<p>It was indeed evident that all these " nouveaux

</p>
<p>real and sole effective power in the country. The

<p>speculative financiers, whose sole aim was to enrich
</p>
<p>themselves. Their nefarious influence may be seen
</p>
<p>in most of the laws passed, and is indeed traceable
</p>
<p>right up to the year 1814. The bulk of the govern-
</p>
<p>ing classes  under Barras, Bonaparte, the Bourbons
</p>
<p> were dominated by, or were in league with, this

<p>band of robbers, who systematically exploited the

<p>the gospel of Babeuf appeared as a godsend.
</p>
<p>Thousands of persons in Paris and in other towns
</p>
<p>of France were on the brink of starvation. The
</p>
<p>economic situation in Paris under the Directory
</p>
<p>and the subsequent years was as desperate as any
</p>
<p>that has been known in the world's history.
</p>
<p>Babeuf had and made many friends and sym-
</p>
<p>pathisers in Arras ; amongst them was the family
</p>
<p>of the ex-proconsul there during the Terror,
</p>
<p>Joseph Lebon, who seem to have become enthusi-
</p>
<p>astic adherents, which is significant, considering
</p>
<p>Lebon's association with the party of Robespierre,

<p>and Babeuf's severe attacks on the Robespierrists

<p>and even on Lebon personally, in the earlier
</p>
<p>88 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>numbers of the Tribun. This is more noteworthy,
</p>
<p>seeing that Lebon was undoubtedly one of the
</p>
<p>most ferocious agents of the Terror, and that
</p>
<p>Babeuf, however much he may have modified his
</p>
<p>view of the character of Robespierre in general,
</p>
<p>had never as yet withdrawn his strictures of the
</p>
<p>system of the Terror itself, which was entirely
</p>
<p>opposed to the humanitarian principles he had
</p>
<p>hitherto professed. However this may be, his
</p>
<p>acquaintance with the Lebons had an important
</p>
<p>result for the movement, for it was in their house
</p>
<p>Babeuf first met Darthe, his subsequent colleague
</p>
<p>and right hand in the Society of the Pantheon, and
</p>
<p>in the conspiracy of the Equals, which was its
</p>
<p>sequel.
</p>
<p>Augustin Alexandre Darthe was a native of
</p>
<p>St Pol, in the department of the Pas-de-Calais.
</p>
<p>Darthe had played a certain public role during
</p>
<p>the Revolution, had taken part in the affair of the
</p>
<p>Bastille, and had been afterwards a member of the
</p>
<p>directing body of his department. In consequence
</p>
<p>of his services in this capacity he had been decreed
</p>
<p>to have " merited well of the country." He subse-

<p>quently became public prosecutor to the revolu-

<p>his incorruptibility and frugality were recognised

<p>VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE 89
</p>
<p>During the time of Babeuf s detention at Arras
</p>
<p>the town was rent by the feud between the Thermi-
</p>
<p>doreans, including the old aristocratic party, now
</p>
<p>reconciled to the wealthier middle-class in their
</p>
<p>abhorrence of the Terror, and the Sansculottes.
</p>
<p>The younger and more ardent members of the
</p>
<p>reactionary coalition, under the name of the
</p>
<p>Jeunesse doree, had adopted an extravagant cos-
</p>
<p>tume and long tresses. The partisans of the
</p>
<p>revolutionary regime were now indiscriminately
</p>
<p>termed Jacobins. At the Theatre disturbances
</p>
<p>took place between the two sides. One such dis-
</p>
<p>turbance, in which the son of the guillotined emigre,
</p>
<p>the Comte de Bethune, with some of his associates,
</p>
<p>took part, led to the arrest of the latter, and their
</p>
<p>detention as prisoners, in company with Babeuf
</p>
<p>and his friends. Babeuf describes the young
</p>
<p>aristocrat as a smooth-faced young man, with an
</p>
<p>attractive but deceptive manner. He continued
</p>
<p>the centre of the reactionary movement in Arras,
</p>
<p>where he held a kind of court, distributing the
</p>
<p>current paper money {assi gnats) lavishly amongst
</p>
<p>his fellows.

</p>
<p>lished in the prison of Arras, and who was subse-

<p>CHAPTER IV
</p>
<p>THE SOCIETY OF THE PANTHEON
</p>
<p>The constitution of the year III., drawn up by
</p>
<p>the Abbe Sieyes, and adopted by the Convention,
</p>
<p>aboHshed universal suffrage, reimposed a high
</p>
<p>property qualification, and created two chambers,
</p>
<p>a lower house, called the Council of Five Hundred,
</p>
<p>and an upper house, called the Council of the
</p>
<p>Ancients, composed of two hundred and fifty
</p>
<p>members. It further provided that two-thirds of
</p>
<p>the representatives in the new Assembly should
</p>
<p>consist of members of the Convention itself. The
</p>
<p>executive government was to consist of a directory
</p>
<p>of five, nominated by the two chambers. This
</p>
<p>constitution was the final expression of the Thermi-
</p>
<p>dorean reaction. It is needless to say that the old
</p>
<p>democratic principles and revolutionary organisation,
</p>
<p>which had found their expression in the Constitution
</p>
<p>of 1793, were thus swept away by a stroke of the
</p>
<p>pen. The Constitution of 1793, which had never
</p>
<p>come into force, had now become the rallying-cry
</p>
<p>of the people's party. The last of the popular

</p>
<p>insurrections, that of the 1st of Prairial, ann. III.
</p>
<p>(JNIay 20th, 1795), had as its cry the " Constitution
</p>
<p>of '93 and the release of the patriots."
</p>
<p>This insurrection, in spite of its momentary
</p>
<p>success, was defeated the same day, and had as its
</p>
<p>upshot the definite proscription of the old party of
</p>
<p>the JNlountain, who having, on the expulsion of the
</p>
<p>other members of the Convention, accepted the
</p>
<p>demands of the insurgents, were now treated as
</p>
<p>rebels. As may well be imagined, Babeufs in-
</p>
<p>dignation at the new constitution, which tricked
</p>
<p>the people out of all the political rights which it
</p>
<p>had won during the Revolution, knew no bounds.
</p>
<p>In a letter written to the patriots of Arras, shortly
</p>
<p>before his removal to Paris, he points out the effect
</p>
<p>of the new constitution. "According to this
</p>
<p>Constitution," he writes, " all those who have no
</p>
<p>territorial property and all those who are unable
</p>
<p>to write, that is to say, the greater part of the
</p>
<p>French nation, will no longer have the right to
</p>
<p>vote in public assemblies ; the rich and the clever
</p>
<p>will alone be the nation. . . . According to this
</p>
<p>Constitution you have two chambers, an upper
</p>
<p>and a lower, a chamber of peers and a chamber
</p>
<p>of commons ; it is no longer the people who sanction
</p>
<p>the laws, it is the upper chamber that has the
</p>
<p>veto ; they might as well have left it to the chamber
</p>
<p>of Louis XVI."

<p>and sympathisers in the departments, notably in
</p>
<p>his own department of the Pas-de-Calais, where
</p>
<p>his Tribun was much read. Many of these
</p>
<p>were now in Paris. With them, and with the
</p>
<p>considerable following he had already obtained
</p>
<p>among the Parisians, Babeuf started in October
</p>
<p>of this year (1795) a political society, having for
</p>
<p>its avowed aim the triumph of Economic no less
</p>
<p>than of Political Equality. A little later this
</p>
<p>society amalgamated with another similar body
</p>
<p>with revolutionary objects, and the two organisa-
</p>
<p>tions, merged into one, now received the title of
</p>
<p>the Society of the Pantheon, from its meeting-
</p>
<p>place. It was not long before all that was revolu-
</p>
<p>tionary  Jacobin, as the phrase went  attached itself
</p>
<p>to the new movement. Of this movement Babeuf 's
</p>
<p>Tribun became the official organ. On his release
</p>
<p>from prison, Babeuf had at once taken up the paper
</p>
<p>at the point, No. 34, where it was dropped eight
</p>
<p>months previously. We have already quoted
</p>
<p>passages in these later numbers, showing that the
</p>
<p>vigour of its denunciation of the dominant parties
</p>
<p>had lost nothing from the interval of its suspension.
</p>
<p>The new movement grew daily in strength during
</p>
<p>the following autumn and winter ; nightly meet-
</p>
<p>ings were held, at which articles from the Tribun
</p>
<p>would be publicly read and discussed. The govern-
</p>
<p>ment began to get seriously alarmed. Neither

</p>
<p>94 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>affected any longer to conceal the true aim of the
</p>
<p>movement.
</p>
<p>A word should be said here as to the causes
</p>
<p>which led the new executive Directory to tolerate
</p>
<p>so long the public meetings of the Society of the
</p>
<p>Pantheon. It was founded, it should be premised,
</p>
<p>immediately after the defeat and the suppres-
</p>
<p>sion by Napoleon of the royalist insurrection
</p>
<p>of October 1795 (13th Vendemiaire). On this
</p>
<p>occasion the government had armed a certain
</p>
<p>number of Jacobins, under the name of the
</p>
<p>"Patriots of '89," against their new royalist enemies,
</p>
<p>whose hopes of triumphs at the elections had been
</p>
<p>foiled by the decree of the Convention that two-
</p>
<p>thirds of the old Convention members were to be
</p>
<p>retained in the new legislative body. The royalists,
</p>
<p>who had recourse, in their turn, on this occasion,
</p>
<p>to an armed insurrection, had to be immediately
</p>
<p>defeated at all costs. The regular troops momen-
</p>
<p>tarily available being inadequate for that purpose
</p>
<p>(the insurgents under arms numbering something
</p>
<p>like 125,000), the aforesaid Jacobins were enrolled,
</p>
<p>and acquitted themselves manfully in dispersing
</p>
<p>the royalist insurgents. In consequence of these
</p>
<p>events, it occurred to the Directory, which had now
</p>
<p>come into being, that the temporary policy of
</p>
<p>conciliation towards the extreme parties was
</p>
<p>desirable. In the first place, they might require

<p>their services again in a similar way ; and in the
</p>
<p>THE SOCIETY OF THE PANTHEON 95
</p>
<p>second place, they could be played off as a bogey
</p>
<p>to the other parties, thereby strengthening the
</p>
<p>hands of the government by showing it up in the
</p>
<p>light of the only bulwark against anarchy and
</p>
<p>Jacobinism.
</p>
<p>The society, on its formation, first of all met in
</p>
<p>the old refectory of the Convent of St Genevieve,
</p>
<p>of which the tenant of the now secularised religious
</p>
<p>house, himself a Jacobin, granted the gratuitous
</p>
<p>use. Later on, after it had increased in numbers,
</p>
<p>the society's meetings were transferred to a large
</p>
<p>subterranean vault in the same building, where,
</p>
<p>according to Buonarroti, the flare of torches, the
</p>
<p>hollow echo of voices, and the attitudes of the
</p>
<p>audience standing, leaning against pillars, or lying
</p>
<p>on the ground, produced a weird effect, well calcu-
</p>
<p>lated to impress those present with the magnitude
</p>
<p>and the dangers of their enterprise. From the
</p>
<p>first the constitution of the society was very
</p>
<p>irregular, no provision being made for the keeping
</p>
<p>of books or minutes, and the only condition of
</p>
<p>admission to its membership being the sponsorship
</p>
<p>of two persons already members. This looseness
</p>
<p>of organisation was largely due to a fear of coming
</p>
<p>into conflict with the new law concerning the right
</p>
<p>of public assembly, which imposed many restric-
</p>
<p>tions, and especially to a desire not to give colour
</p>
<p>to the notion that the Pantheon Society was a

<p>revival of the Jacobin Club under another name,

</p>
<p>which, it was felt, would at once arouse hostility in
</p>
<p>influential circles, and lead to suppression of the
</p>
<p>society and to the persecution of its members.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the looseness of procedure was
</p>
<p>the fruitful cause of many undesirable persons
</p>
<p>being admitted, although the nature of the move-
</p>
<p>ment at the outset, not being a wholly secret
</p>
<p>society, but avowedly a political party (albeit
</p>
<p>with well-nigh undisguised insurrectionary aims),
</p>
<p>rendered anything like a strict scrutiny of candi-
</p>
<p>dates for admission a practical impossibility.
</p>
<p>The society had not been long in existence
</p>
<p>before it counted over two thousand constant
</p>
<p>members. But it might have been remarked that
</p>
<p>it was not altogether homogeneous in respect
</p>
<p>of principles. There seems to have been a right
</p>
<p>and left wing, the first composed of miscellaneous
</p>
<p>Jacobins, calling themselves "Patriots of '89," many
</p>
<p>of whom had fought against the royalist insurgents
</p>
<p>on the 13th of Vendemiaire, and who, in conse-
</p>
<p>quence, had some influence with the government,
</p>
<p>and the more thoroughgoing and definite adherents
</p>
<p>of the doctrine of Equality, as understood by Babeuf
</p>
<p>and his friends. While the latter were untiring in
</p>
<p>agitating against the constitution recently come
</p>
<p>into force, and the fraudulent manner in which the
</p>
<p>small middle and working classes had been cheated
</p>
<p>of the fruits of the Revolution, the former were

<p>their associates. Nevertheless, for a time all worked
</p>
<p>fairly harmoniously together. A demand was
</p>
<p>made for the giving effect to a decree passed
</p>
<p>during the Terror, according to which one milliard
</p>
<p>of the proceeds derived from the sale of the national
</p>
<p>lands should be distributed among the " defenders
</p>
<p>of the country," to wit, those returned from the
</p>
<p>wars ; and in the case of those slain, for their
</p>
<p>families. The application of the poor law of
</p>
<p>ann. II. was also demanded. Other similar
</p>
<p>societies to that of the Pantheon now began to be
</p>
<p>formed, and to hold meetings in various parts of
</p>
<p>Paris.
</p>
<p>Babeuf, as already intimated, boldly proclaimed
</p>
<p>in his paper, the Tribun du Peuple, the doctrine of
</p>
<p>equality, scathingly criticised the Directory, and
</p>
<p>continued unremittingly to denounce individual
</p>
<p>property-holding as the principal source of all the
</p>
<p>evil weighing on society. It was not long indeed
</p>
<p>before a new mandate of arrest was launched against
</p>
<p>him. Early in February 1796 the Directory de-
</p>
<p>cided to take vigorous measures for the suppres-
</p>
<p>sion of the Tribun. Accordingly, an officer of the
</p>
<p>Court repaired to the Faubourg St Honore No. 29
</p>
<p>to execute the warrant. Babeuf, however, resisted,
</p>
<p>eventually succeeding in shaking the officer off,

<p>and dashed down the street, with the government
</p>
<p>representative at his heels shouting " stop thief ! "

<p>to a shelter afforded him by Darthe and another

<p>friend. Foiled in their attempt to seize the person
</p>
<p>of Babeuf, the authorities consoled themselves by-
</p>
<p>ordering the arrest of his wife and two children,
</p>
<p>one of whom was ill at the time. Members of the
</p>
<p>Society of the Pantheon subscribed financial aid, as
</p>
<p>did also his friends and followers at Arras. The
</p>
<p>prosecution, however, succeeded in its object ; and
</p>
<p>although Babeuf managed to issue a few more
</p>
<p>numbers from his retreat, the journal came to an
</p>
<p>end in a few days with the 43rd issue, which ex-
</p>
<p>ceeds in boldness all that had gone before it. The
</p>
<p>Trihun du Peuple, after criticising the proclamation
</p>
<p>of the Directory, its severe penal laws recently
</p>
<p>enacted against the liberty of public meeting and
</p>
<p>of the press, winds up : " All is finished. The

<p>But even now Babeuf did not give up hope.

</p>
<p>shall break all the chains to prevent thee dying
</p>
<p>the victims of those who torture thee, who
</p>
<p>plunder thee, and who abuse thee these twenty-
</p>
<p>months past." But the prophecy of Babeuf was
</p>
<p>not to be fulfilled. The Repubhc of the Rich, in
</p>
<p>which the new class that had entered into the
</p>
<p>spoils of the feudal and ecclesiastical aristocracy of
</p>
<p>old was to play the dominant role, was, before
</p>
<p>many years were over, destined to cast off even
</p>
<p>its republican form, and become an undisguised
</p>
<p>military despotism. Not for nothing had the

<p>young artillery officer won his spurs in the royalist
</p>
<p>insurrection of the 13th of Vendemiaire.
</p>
<p>Hard upon the final collapse of the Tribun du

<p>Peuple, at its 43rd number, followed the publica-

<p>tion of the celebrated " Manifesto of the Equals,"

<p>100 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>non-resistance and submission to the Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion of the year III. The pohcy of these
</p>
<p>government agents reached its cHmax in a motion
</p>
<p>proposing the sending of an obsequious address to
</p>
<p>the Directory, in which the society should formally
</p>
<p>declare its adhesion to the new constitution ; and
</p>
<p>the influence of the section formed within the
</p>
<p>society by them was sufficiently powerful to
</p>
<p>overcome the stormy opposition with which the
</p>
<p>motion was received by that portion of the
</p>
<p>society which remained true to the principles on
</p>
<p>which it had been founded, and to get the motion
</p>
<p>of subservience carried. The tactics of the govern-
</p>
<p>ment in their dealings with the Pantheonists were
</p>
<p>distinctly clever, since it made evident an un-
</p>
<p>mistakable cleavage in their body, which showed
</p>
<p>plainly who were those constituting the irreconcil-
</p>
<p>able section and who were their leaders. The latter
</p>
<p>seemed to have regained their ascendancy in the
</p>
<p>society, as also in the branches scattered over Paris.
</p>
<p>Among the many practical questions of the
</p>
<p>hour which occupied the attention of the Pan-
</p>
<p>theonists, and were the subjects of the petitions
</p>
<p>of the partisans of the society to the legislative
</p>
<p>body, was the burning one  the fall in the value of
</p>
<p>the assigtiat. This was so violent that the price
</p>
<p>of the necessaries of life often doubled in the
</p>
<p>course of a single day, thus rendering it impossible

<p>for wages to keep on a level with them. Hence the
</p>
<p>THE SOCIETY OF THE PANTHEON 101
</p>
<p>handicraftsman, small trader, and the proletariat
</p>
<p>found ruin staring them in the face. Nevertheless,
</p>
<p>Babeuf and his friends deprecated any ill-con-
</p>
<p>sidered and immature attacks upon the govern-
</p>
<p>ment, urging the discussion of the principles of the
</p>
<p>rights of man and of peoples rather than a too
</p>
<p>eager application of them to the tyrants of the
</p>
<p>hour, until public opinion should be sufficiently
</p>
<p>formed to admit of more drastic action. With the
</p>
<p>spread of their views in popularity, the leaders of
</p>
<p>the movement began to bethink themselves of
</p>
<p>means for extending still further their propaganda.
</p>
<p>Being many of them deists of the traditional
</p>
<p>eighteenth-century type, it was decided to present
</p>
<p>the political and economic doctrine of the Equals
</p>
<p>in a religious guise as part of the divinely ordained
</p>
<p>order of nature. They therefore decided, through
</p>
<p>the society, to apply to the authorities for per-
</p>
<p>mission to use one of the larger vacant churches in
</p>
<p>Paris for the purpose of celebrating a deistic festival.
</p>
<p>It should be explained that the government
</p>
<p>itself, under the auspices of one of its members,
</p>
<p>Larivelliere-Lepeaux, the " Theophilanthropist," at
</p>
<p>this time was introducing popular festivals once
</p>
<p>a decade in the churches in place of the JNIass
</p>
<p>and the abohshed services of the Catholic Church.
</p>
<p>The government, of course, at once saw through
</p>
<p>this demand and refused the application, on the

</p>
<p>pretext that the popular services mentioned, which
</p>
<p>102 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>were about to be officially instituted, would meet
</p>
<p>the needs of the situation. But the project was
</p>
<p>not given up ; the subject was discussed during
</p>
<p>many meetings of the society, and eventually the
</p>
<p>friends of Babeuf got their way. It was decided
</p>
<p>that the society should occupy " the decades " (the
</p>
<p>tenth days) in honouring in public the divinity by
</p>
<p>the preaching of the " natural law." A commission
</p>
<p>was then appointed to hire a church and draw
</p>
<p>up regulations for the new cult. The project, it
</p>
<p>should be said, met with considerable opposition in
</p>
<p>the society, as being a return to forms of super-
</p>
<p>stition, and it had to be explained to the members,
</p>
<p>as plainly as possible, consistently with safety, that
</p>
<p>the religious form was merely a disguise, hiding a
</p>
<p>social and political object.
</p>
<p>By this time the Directory had become thoroughly
</p>
<p>alarmed at the progress of the discussions of the
</p>
<p>Society of the Pantheon. Henceforward the police
</p>
<p>were instructed to spy upon every movement of
</p>
<p>the orators. All that was wanting now was a
</p>
<p>colourable pretext for government action. The
</p>
<p>convent near the Pantheon where the society met
</p>
<p>was now known, in respectable and moderate
</p>
<p>circles, as the " Cave of Brigands." By the be-
</p>
<p>ginning of February 1796 most of the doubtful
</p>
<p>and reactionary elements of the movement would
</p>
<p>seem to have left, and the influence of Babeuf

</p>
<p>and his friends dominated the whole body.
</p>
<p>THE SOCIETY OF THE PANTHEON 103
</p>
<p>There still remained, however, \sdthin the fold,
</p>
<p>a few police spies, whose function it was to
</p>
<p>report all that occurred at the meetings, and any-
</p>
<p>private information they could obtain from indivi-
</p>
<p>duals, to the authorities. The pretext sought for
</p>
<p>by the government was furnished by Darthe in
</p>
<p>the reading of a number of the Tribwi of
</p>
<p>Babeuf, in which the Directors and the leading
</p>
<p>members of the legislative body were vigorously
</p>
<p>attacked. Darthe was applauded to the echo when
</p>
<p>he had finished, but a few days after, on the 29th
</p>
<p>February 1796, the closure of the meeting-place of
</p>
<p>the Pantheonists and the dissolution of the society
</p>
<p>was ordered by the Directory, and was carried out
</p>
<p>in person by General Bonaparte. He it was,
</p>
<p>indeed, as is alleged, who was the leading spirit in
</p>
<p>the affair, and who, by means of spy-information he
</p>
<p>had obtained as to the real aims of the society,
</p>
<p>succeeded in inspiring panic in the Directory. As
</p>
<p>stated, he came in person, and compelled the keys
</p>
<p>of the meeting-place to be given into his hands.
</p>
<p>The usual attempt was made to discredit the
</p>
<p>Babouvists, as we may now call them, in public
</p>
<p>opinion, by representing their leaders as disguised
</p>
<p>royalist agents, seeking by means of anarchistic
</p>
<p>exaggerations to discredit the Republic.

<p>CHAPTER V
</p>
<p>THE SECRET DIRECTORY AND ITS PRINCIPLES
</p>
<p>There was now only one course left to the
</p>
<p>Babouvists, and that was the concentration of the
</p>
<p>movement in the hands of a secret committee of
</p>
<p>insurrection.
</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that before this, while
</p>
<p>the Society of the Pantheon was still flourishing, a
</p>
<p>secret committee to prepare an insurrection against
</p>
<p>the new tyranny had been formed, and met at the
</p>
<p>house in the Rue Clery, of Amar, the former
</p>
<p>member of the Committee of General Security
</p>
<p>during the Terror. It consisted of Amar himself,
</p>
<p>Darthe, Buonarroti, Massart (an adjutant-general
</p>
<p>of the army), and Germain, and was subsequently
</p>
<p>enlarged by the addition of other members.
</p>
<p>Among the above-mentioned persons, Philippe
</p>
<p>Buonarroti is worthy of special note. Descended
</p>
<p>from Michael Angelo Buonarroti, born in Pisa
</p>
<p>in 1764, exiled from Italy owing to his enthusiastic
</p>
<p>adoption of French revolutionary principles, he
</p>
<p>became a prominent Jacobin, and was honoured by

</p>
<p>the Convention with the title of French citizen,
</p>
<p>joined the Society of the Pantheon, and became an
</p>
<p>enthusiastic supporter of Babeuf at the period at
</p>
<p>which we have arrived.
</p>
<p>The theory of this committee was that the
</p>
<p>existing government estabhshed by the Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion of the year III. was illegitimate and an
</p>
<p>usurpation ; that, in addition, its intentions were
</p>
<p>oppressive and tyrannical, and that the public
</p>
<p>welfare demanded its destruction. Amar and one
</p>
<p>or two other members whose ideas were not clear
</p>
<p>were soon brought over by Darthe and Buonarroti
</p>
<p>to be enthusiastic adherents of the communistic
</p>
<p>doctrines of Babeuf and the " Equals." This com-
</p>
<p>mittee, however, for various reasons, chief of which
</p>
<p>was the unjust denunciation of Amar by a former
</p>
<p>colleague of his, named Heron, who seems to have
</p>
<p>borne him implacable hatred, was dissolved. An
</p>
<p>attempt during the next few weeks to form various
</p>
<p>similar groups also came to nothing, and it was not
</p>
<p>until April that the celebrated committee composed
</p>
<p>of Babeuf, Debon, Buonarroti, Darthe, Felix Lepel-
</p>
<p>letier, and Sylvain Marechal was founded, and
</p>
<p>became the centre of the renowned Conspiracy of
</p>
<p>the " Equals," which only just missed overthrowing
</p>
<p>the Constitution of the year HI., and the govern-
</p>
<p>ment founded upon it.

<p>members of this head centre of the conspiracy ;
</p>
<p>THE SECRET DIRECTORY 107
</p>
<p>political liberty and economic equality were the
</p>
<p>objects animating all. Sylvain Marechal, already
</p>
<p>known as a prominent orator at the Pantheon,
</p>
<p>drew up the celebrated " Manifesto of the
</p>
<p>Equals" as a condensed exposition of the aims
</p>
<p>of the movement, and proposed its acceptance
</p>
<p>by his colleagues. Sylvain Marechal, it may be
</p>
<p>noted, was not unknown to literary fame, having
</p>
<p>suffered four months' imprisonment during the
</p>
<p>ancien regime for a publication entitled the Alma-
</p>
<p>nack of Honest Men {Almanack des honnetes
</p>
<p>gens). He also wrote a work entitled the Atheisfs
</p>
<p>Dictionary {Dictionnaire des Athees). The Secret
</p>
<p>Directory, as the committee was called, not alto-
</p>
<p>gether approving certain expressions in the mani-
</p>
<p>festo, did not authorise its publication as an
</p>
<p>authoritative statement of the views held by it, but
</p>
<p>its historical importance, nevertheless, as the best
</p>
<p>known short statement of the aims of the move-
</p>
<p>ment, induces us to give it here in its entirety.
</p>
<p>The manifesto of the Equals bears for its motto a
</p>
<p>phrase of Condorcet's  " Equality of fact, the final
</p>
<p>aim of social art." It proceeds as follows : 
</p>
<p>" People of France ! During fifteen centuries you
</p>
<p>have lived as slaves, and in consequence unhappily.
</p>
<p>It is scarcely six years that you have begun to
</p>
<p>breathe, in the expectation of independence, happi-
</p>
<p>ness, equality ! The first demand of nature, the

<p>France ! you have not been more favoured than
</p>
<p>other nations who vegetate on this unfortunate
</p>
<p>growth ! Always and everywhere the poor
</p>
<p>human race, delivered over to more or less adroit
</p>
<p>cannibals, has served as a plaything for all ambi-
</p>
<p>tions, as a pasture for all tyrannies. Always and
</p>
<p>everywhere men have been lulled by fine words ;
</p>
<p>never and nowhere have they obtained the thing
</p>
<p>with the word. From time immemorial it has been
</p>
<p>repeated, with hypocrisy, that vien are equal ; and
</p>
<p>from time immemorial the most degi'ading and
</p>
<p>the most monstrous inequality ceaselessly weighs
</p>
<p>on the human race. Since the dawn of civil society
</p>
<p>this noblest appanage of man has been recognised
</p>
<p>without contradiction, but has on no single
</p>
<p>occasion been realised ; equality has never been
</p>
<p>anything but a beautiful and sterile fiction of the
</p>
<p>law. To-day, when it is demanded with a stronger
</p>
<p>voice, they reply to us : ' Be silent, wretches !
</p>
<p>Equality of fact is nought but a chimera ; be con-
</p>
<p>tented with conditional equality ; you are all equal

<p>before the law. Canaille, what do you want more ? '

<p>with difficulty, it may be, the near future of common

<p>which they had beneath their hand ?

<p>well-being was to be had for so little ? We had only

<p>THE SECRET DIRECTORY 113
</p>
<p>to will it. Ah ! why did we not will it sooner ?
</p>
<p>Why had we to be told about it so many times ?
</p>
<p>Yes, doubtless, with one man on earth richer, more
</p>
<p>powerful than his neighbours, than his equals, the
</p>
<p>equilibrium is broken, crime and misery are already
</p>
<p>in the world. People of France ! by what sign
</p>
<p>ought you henceforward to recognise the excellence
</p>
<p>of a constitution ? That which rests entirely on an
</p>
<p>equality of fact is the only one that can benefit
</p>
<p>you and satisfy all your wants.
</p>
<p>"The aristocratic charters of 1791 to 1795 have
</p>
<p>only riveted your bonds instead of rending them.
</p>
<p>That of 1793 was a great step indeed towards real
</p>
<p>equality, and never before had it been approached
</p>
<p>so closely ; but yet, it did not achieve the aim
</p>
<p>and did not touch the common well-being, of
</p>
<p>which, nevertheless, it solemnly consecrated the
</p>
<p>great principle.
</p>
<p>" People of France ! open your eyes and your

<p>matter, and indeed is a very common proceeding
</p>
<p>under similar circumstances ; and we may reason-

<p>ably suspect some other reason as having influenced
</p>
<p>the committee against publishing the statement,
</p>
<p>which certainly in substance represented the views
</p>
<p>of all its members. Be this as it may, the " Secret
</p>
<p>Directory" decided, in its place, to publish and
</p>
<p>circulate the somewhat shorter and certainly less
</p>
<p>rhetorical document, probably drawn up by Babeuf
</p>
<p>himself, and entitled " Analysis of the Doctrine of

<p>Babeuf, Tribune of the People, proscribed by the

</p>
<p>{Analyse de la doctrine de Babeuf, tribun du
</p>

</p>
<p>dit la verite). It is divided into fifteen paragraphs,
</p>
<p>and is as follows : 
</p>
<p>' 1. Nature has given to every man an equal
</p>
<p>right to the enjoyment of all goods.
</p>
<p>" 2. The object of society is to defend its equality,
</p>
<p>often attacked by the strong and the wicked in the
</p>
<p>state of nature, and to augment, by the co-operation
</p>
<p>of all, the common means of enjoyment.
</p>
<p>"3. Nature has imposed upon each one the
</p>
<p>obligation to work. No one can evade work with-
</p>
<p>out committing a crime.
</p>

<p>to all.

<p>exhausting himself with work, wants for every-

</p>
<p>thing, while another swims in abundance without
</p>
<p>doing anything.
</p>
<p>"6. No one, without committing a crime, can
</p>
<p>appropriate to himself exclusively the products of
</p>
<p>the earth and industry.
</p>
<p>"7. In a true society there ought to be neither
</p>
<p>rich nor poor.
</p>
<p>"8. The rich who are unwilling to renounce their
</p>
<p>superfluity in favour of the indigent are the enemies
</p>
<p>of the people.
</p>
<p>" 9. No one should be able, by the accumulation
</p>
<p>of all the means necessary thereto, to deprive
</p>
<p>another of the instruction essential to his welfare ;
</p>
<p>instruction ought to be in common.
</p>
<p>" 10. The object of a revolution is to destroy any
</p>
<p>inequality, and to establish the well-being of all.
</p>
<p>" 11. The Revolution is not finished, because the
</p>
<p>rich absorb all the good things of life and rule
</p>
<p>exclusively, while the poor labour as veritable
</p>
<p>slaves, languishing in misery, and counting as

<p>the Frenchman because the people have solemnly

<p>defending the people ; because the terror of the
</p>
<p>116 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>people and the influence of the emigrant aristocrats
</p>
<p>has presided at the drawing up and the pretended
</p>
<p>acceptance of the Constitution of Anno III. (1795),
</p>
<p>which has not obtained even the fourth part of the
</p>
<p>votes cast for that of 1793 ; because the Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion of 1793 has consecrated the inaUenable right
</p>
<p>of every citizen to consent to the laws, to exercise
</p>
<p>political rights, to hold public meetings, to demand
</p>
<p>that which he believes to be useful, to educate him-
</p>
<p>self, and not to die of hunger,  rights which the
</p>
<p>counter-revolutionary Act of Anno III. (1795) has
</p>
<p>openly and completely violated.
</p>
<p>" 13. Every citizen is bound to re-estabhsh and
</p>
<p>to defend the Constitution of 1793  the will and
</p>
<p>the well-being of the people.
</p>
<p>" 14. All the powers derived from the pretended
</p>
<p>Constitution of Anno III. (1795) are illegal and
</p>
<p>counter-revolutionary.
</p>
<p>"15. Those who have raised their hand against
</p>
<p>the Constitution of 1793 are guilty of treason
</p>
<p>against the people."
</p>
<p>Such is the official statement of the general aims
</p>
<p>of the Insurrectionary Committee or Secret Direc-
</p>
<p>tory, of which Babeuf was the leading spirit. The
</p>
<p>view expressed as to the illegality of the Constitution
</p>
<p>of the year III. (1795) is indisputable. The earlier

</p>
<p>thoroughly democratic character, had not only been
</p>
<p>THE SECRET DIRECTORY 117
</p>
<p>accepted by the Convention itself, but had been
</p>
<p>ratified in a subsequent referendum by an over-
</p>
<p>whelming majority of the communes throughout
</p>
<p>France in their primary assembUes. Hence for
</p>
<p>the Convention, two years later, of its ow^n
</p>
<p>authority, arbitrarily to tear up an Act of con-
</p>
<p>stitution, not merely adopted by itself, but solemnly
</p>
<p>ratified by a vote of the French people, was clearly
</p>
<p>a violation of all law, custom, or constitutional
</p>
<p>procedure whatever. It was, in short, an impudent
</p>
<p>and unscrupulous usurpation of power by the
</p>
<p>nouveaux riches of France and their satellites.
</p>
<p>As such, the " Secret Directory " was fully justified
</p>
<p>in declaring it to be an outrage on the people, and
</p>
<p>in no way binding on any Frenchman.
</p>
<p>From this point of view, all authority deriving its
</p>
<p>sanction from the new Constitution of the year III.
</p>
<p>was null and void, and any exercise of power or act
</p>
<p>of violence on the part of such authority was, without
</p>
<p>doubt, justifiably to be regarded as mere brigand-
</p>
<p>age. It was the primary objective, so to say, of
</p>
<p>the movement, the rehabilitation of the Constitution
</p>
<p>of 1793, that attracted all the old revolutionary
</p>
<p>elements to it, and united them in one accord.
</p>
<p>Old " jNIountainists " and committee-men, partisans
</p>
<p>of Hebert and Chaumette, worked side by side
</p>
<p>with their old opponents, partisans of Robespierre,

<p>and both with the new Communist democrats,

<p>Babeuf and his friends. The realisation of the
</p>
<p>118 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>Constitution of '93 was the link which bound them.
</p>
<p>In one respect, the " Secret Directory " was simply
</p>
<p>a continuation of the Society of the Pantheon, in
</p>
<p>so far as the work of propaganda and the educating
</p>
<p>and organising of public opinion was the chief
</p>
<p>object. At the same time, while steadily keeping
</p>
<p>in view their ultimate aims, Babeuf and his friends,
</p>
<p>who formed the soul of the new movement, made
</p>
<p>it the chief point at this time to rally the scattered
</p>
<p>revolutionary forces under the banner of the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution of '93, an object upon which all could unite.
</p>
<p>But it must not be supposed that the Babouvists
</p>
<p>regarded this work of the Convention in its
</p>
<p>revolutionary period as by any means perfect.
</p>
<p>For one thing, they naturally objected to its re-
</p>
<p>affirmation of the articles in the Declaration of the
</p>
<p>Rights of Man concerning the principles of private
</p>
<p>property - holding. Even the constitution itself
</p>
<p>they considered as offering insufficient guarantees
</p>
<p>against usurpations on the part of the legislative
</p>
<p>body. But they proposed to remedy these defects
</p>
<p>by additions and modifications after the constitu-
</p>
<p>tion had been once in principle adopted. It was
</p>
<p>enough for them that the Constitution of '93 was
</p>
<p>the best as a whole, and the most democratic up
</p>
<p>to date ; that it had been accepted almost unani-
</p>
<p>mously by the French democracy, and that it was
</p>
<p>the one possible rally ing-point for all the revolu-

<p>tionary parties.
</p>
<p>THE SECRET DIRECTORY 119
</p>
<p>Part of the work of the " Secret Directory "
</p>
<p>was to establish and keep going throughout Paris,
</p>
<p>now that public discussion on a large scale, as at
</p>
<p>the old convent of St Genevieve with the Pan-
</p>
<p>theonists, was suppressed, small groups in private
</p>
<p>houses and elsewhere, beyond the observation
</p>
<p>of the authorities, which were often unknown to
</p>
<p>each other, but were under the direct supervision
</p>
<p>of the " Secret Directory " itself. In order to
</p>
<p>carry on this organisation effectively the committee
</p>
<p>established twelve revolutionary agents, the selec-
</p>
<p>tion of these agents occupying an important part
</p>
<p>of the time of the " Secret Directory."' Several
</p>
<p>were chosen to disaffect the army, one being selected
</p>
<p>for each of the battalions stationed in Paris and
</p>
<p>the suburbs. Thus a certain Fion was sent to the
</p>
<p>Invalides ; another, V^anek, had a roving commission
</p>
<p>among the various bodies of troops in the capital.
</p>
<p>Charles Germain, of whom we have already
</p>
<p>spoken, and who made Babeuf's acquaintance in the
</p>
<p>prison of Arras, was allotted the task of winning over
</p>
<p>the legion of police ; and an army captain, George
</p>
<p>Grisel, of whom we shall hear more presently, was
</p>
<p>appointed to work on behalf of the " Secret Direc-
</p>
<p>tory " at that important military centre, the camp
</p>
<p>at Grenelle, near Paris, where he himself was
</p>
<p>stationed. Grisel had made the acquaintance of
</p>
<p>Darthe, who, with Germain, were now the right

<p>hands of Babeuf in the *' Secret Directory " in the
</p>
<p>120 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>matter of organisation. The Cafe of the " Bains
</p>
<p>aux Chinois " was at the time a rendezvous of the
</p>
<p>democratic party. It was here that Grisel, a man
</p>
<p>of plausible speech, soon ingratiated himself with
</p>
<p>Darthe and the other leaders of the Equals, and
</p>
<p>became before long one of their most trusted and
</p>
<p>valued agents.
</p>
<p>Great attention was now given also to the work
</p>
<p>of general propaganda by means of fly-sheets and
</p>
<p>placards, the analysis of the doctrine of Babeuf,
</p>
<p>already given, being distributed and placarded in
</p>
<p>great profusion. Another broadsheet was entitled
</p>
<p>An Opinion on our Two Constitutions  a letter
</p>
<p>of France Libre to his friend the Terror. Yet
</p>
<p>others were, Do we owe Obedience to the Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion of the year III. ? and the Address of the
</p>
<p>Tribune to the Army ; the Triumph of the French
</p>
<p>People against its Oppressors, etc. There was
</p>
<p>scarcely a day at this time which did not see some
</p>
<p>new publication of the Babou^^Lsts. They were
</p>
<p>all eagerly read by thousands, for the distress
</p>
<p>consequent on the startling depreciation of the
</p>
<p>assignats was growing rapidly every day. The
</p>
<p>success of the " Secret Directory " became now
</p>
<p>everywhere apparent. The secret or semi-secret
</p>
<p>groups founded by the " Secret Directory " had
</p>
<p>borne such good fruit that pubhc meetings in the
</p>
<p>streets and open spaces, in which the Constitution

</p>
<p>THE SECRET DIRECTORY 121
</p>
<p>doctrines discussed, sprang up, as it seemed, spon-
</p>
<p>taneously.
</p>
<p>It was now the beginning of May. Babeuf
</p>
<p>became more than ever the responsible leader of
</p>
<p>the whole insurrectionary movement. He it was
</p>
<p>who almost exclusively carried on the correspond-
</p>
<p>ence and issued the instructions to his agents,
</p>
<p>through the intermediary of a colleague and old
</p>
<p>friend. Didier. and in his retreat were deposited
</p>
<p>all the documents and the official seal of the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. It was clear that the time was becoming
</p>
<p>ripe for action. The only question was what form
</p>
<p>the action should take, and what form of govern-
</p>
<p>mental organisation should be estabhshed in the
</p>
<p>place of the hated Constitution of the year III., with
</p>
<p>its executive directory, which it was proposed to
</p>
<p>overthrow. To have called together the primary
</p>
<p>assemblies at once to elect a legislative body con-
</p>
<p>formable to the Constitution of '93 being imprac-
</p>
<p>ticable, it was obvious that an interval of time must
</p>
<p>elapse between the insurrection and the putting of
</p>
<p>the constitution into force. The question to be
</p>
<p>decided therefore was, what form should the interim
</p>
<p>public authority take ? This question of the pro-
</p>
<p>visional government to be established on the success
</p>
<p>of the coup de main, which circumstances now
</p>
<p>pointed to as the next important step to be taken
</p>
<p>by the committee, became urgent.

<p>Amar, the old member of the Committee of
</p>
<p>122 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>General Security during the revolutionary period,
</p>
<p>proposed to reconstitute the National Convention
</p>
<p>as the only legitimate authority. But since, by
</p>
<p>arbitrary acts, a certain section of the Convention
</p>
<p>had rendered their authority null and void, and
</p>
<p>since a large number of the original members, to
</p>
<p>wit, those constituting the old party of the JMoun-
</p>
<p>tain, had been driven out, exiled, or deprived of
</p>
<p>their political rights by the usurping dominant
</p>
<p>power, he proposed to recall all those members of
</p>
<p>the Convention who had been expelled and declared
</p>
<p>ineligible for re-election, together with that third of
</p>
<p>the old Convention at the time of its dissolution,
</p>
<p>which, not having formed part of the new legislative
</p>
<p>body (namely, the Council of "Five Hundred and
</p>
<p>the Ancients "), had not been responsible for the
</p>
<p>usurpation. To this it was objected that many
</p>
<p>of those it was proposed to readmit had been
</p>
<p>guilty of arbitrary acts in their capacity of Thermi-
</p>
<p>doreans, such as the closing of the popular societies,
</p>
<p>the proscription of good democrats, the reintro-
</p>
<p>duction into the Convention of the seventy-three ex-
</p>
<p>pelled Girondins, and the liberation of aristocratic
</p>
<p>conspirators, etc.
</p>
<p>These and other considerations were deemed by
</p>
<p>the committee as a whole to outweigh the advan-
</p>
<p>tages to be gained by the movement in giving it
</p>
<p>a certain colour of legality, which, it was admitted,

<p>was before all things desirable to prevent the return
</p>
<p>THE SECRET DIRECTORY 123
</p>
<p>of the reaction. To this end men were wanted at
</p>
<p>the helm of affairs, and to effect a control over them,
</p>
<p>whose principles and whose courage were alike
</p>
<p>beyond suspicion ; hence the ' Secret Directory "
</p>
<p>decided that the insurgents in Paris should elect a
</p>
<p>provisional authority to which the government of
</p>
<p>the nation should be confided, until such time as
</p>
<p>it was possible to put the Constitution of '93 into
</p>
<p>force. The question of the form this provincial
</p>
<p>government should take in a narrower sense still
</p>
<p>remained to be decided. Debon and Darthe pro-
</p>
<p>posed the dictatorship of one man. In support
</p>
<p>of their ideas, the inevitable examples from Roman
</p>
<p>history were put forward by them, while they
</p>
<p>drew a warning as to the disastrous results of
</p>
<p>divided councils from the divisions in the late
</p>
<p>Committee of Pubhc Safety during the Terror.
</p>
<p>However, the proposition was not favourably
</p>
<p>received by the committee as a whole, and so it .
</p>
<p>was decided that the provisional government
</p>
<p>should consist of a committee with a limited
</p>
<p>number of members. The conspirators met
</p>
<p>nearly every evening in the house where Babeuf
</p>
<p>was concealed. Babeuf himself was formally
</p>
<p>recognised as the leader of the movement, with
</p>
<p>whom was deposited the documents and the

<p>124 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>every important document had to be stamped
</p>
<p>before transmission to the revolutionary agent
</p>
<p>for whom it was destined. The following is given
</p>
<p>by Buonarroti as the usual agenda of the meet-
</p>
<p>ings :  1. Reports of agents, and replies thereto.
</p>
<p>2. Documents to be printed. 3. Propositions on
</p>
<p>the form of the insurrection. 4. The tendency of
</p>
<p>the legislation to be followed. 5. The institutions
</p>
<p>and organisation of the Republic. Decisions were
</p>
<p>taken by a simple majority, and were consigned to a
</p>
<p>register, in which, however, no signatures appeared.

<p>The documents in question each bear the head-

</p>
<p>A section follows on " public works," containing
</p>
<p>the following articles : 
</p>
<p>" I. Every member of the community is pledged
</p>
<p>to perform all labour of which he is capable
</p>
<p>in agriculture and in industry: II. Those are
</p>
<p>excepted who have passed their sixtieth year, as
</p>
<p>also the weak in health : III. Those citizens who,
</p>
<p>in consequence of the voluntary surrender of their

<p>executive body, especially as to the distribution,
</p>
<p>the more agreeable arrangement, and the improve-

<p>the burden of human toil : IX. The communal

<p>persons, of either sex, to compulsory labour whose

</p>
<p>perty of the community : 
</p>
<p>" I. No member of the community may claim
</p>
<p>more for himself than the law, through the inter-
</p>
<p>mediary of the authorities, allows him : II. The
</p>
<p>national community assures from this time to
</p>
<p>each of its members a healthy, convenient, and
</p>
<p>well-furnished dwelling ; clothes for work and
</p>
<p>clothes for leisure, of linen or wool, as the national

</p>
<p>" Of the management of the national community
</p>
<p>of goods :

<p>under the legal direction of the highest power :
</p>
<p>II. As regards the management of the community
</p>
<p>of goods, the republic is divided into regions :
</p>
<p>III. A region comprises all adjoining departments
</p>
<p>which furnish nearly the same kind of products :
</p>
<p>IV. In every region a subordinate management
</p>
<p>for the purposes of mediation shall be appointed,
</p>
<p>to which the directing bodies of each department
</p>
<p>shall be subordinated : V. Telegraph lines shall

<p>apportionment of goods to the members of the

<p>one department by the excess of another ; shall

<p>country in this way will be confiscated for the
</p>
<p>benefit of the national community ; those acting
</p>
<p>to the contrary will be punished : II. The republic

<p>shall acquire for the national community those

<p>objects of which it has need by exchanging its

<p>surplus of agricultural and industrial products
</p>
<p>against those of other nations : III. For this

<p>the frontiers and on the coasts : IV. The supreme

<p>" Of Taxes.  I. Only persons not belonging to
</p>
<p>the community are liable to taxation: II. They

<p>have to pay the taxes previously fixed: III.
</p>
<p>These taxes are to be paid in kind, and to be

<p>to taxation, progressively, on an ascending scale,

<p>according to the department: VI. Non-members

<p>in this respect shall be punished with penal servi-

<p>The foregoing document, which was never more

<p>than a draft, may or may not have been drawn up
</p>
<p>by Babeuf himself In any case it is instructive,
</p>
<p>as illustrative of the notions of socialistic reorganis-

</p>
<p>party of Equals, and not less of eighteenth- century
</p>
<p>sociology in general. The common fallacy in-

</p>
<p>herent in the latter, and in which the Babouvists
</p>
<p>THE SECRET DIRECTORY 135
</p>
<p>shared, was the notion that a new society could be
</p>
<p>voluntarily built up overnight, based on abstract
</p>
<p>concepts, and finished off in its details, by the
</p>
<p>artistic sense of a few capable leaders. What
</p>
<p>further strikes us in reading the Babouvists' mani-
</p>
<p>festoes, drafts, and programmes, as in the other
</p>
<p>proposals and speeches of the time bearing on
</p>
<p>social reform or revolution, is the comparative
</p>
<p>simplicity of the economic structure of society
</p>
<p>before the rise of the great machine-industry, and
</p>
<p>all that the latter has involved. As William Morris
</p>
<p>used to say, the change in social conditions between
</p>
<p>the first Egyptian dynasty and the end of the
</p>
<p>eighteenth century was, take it all in all, less
</p>
<p>profound than the change between the end of
</p>
<p>the eighteenth and the end of the nineteenth
</p>
<p>centuries. The theory of the Equals, as that of
</p>
<p>their successors, the Utopian Socialists of the
</p>
<p>earlier nineteenth century, was a scheme of social
</p>
<p>reconstruction. To-day, in the earlier twentieth
</p>
<p>century, we have done with schemes. Modern
</p>
<p>Socialism has no scheme : it has certain principles,
</p>
<p>and certain tactics and methods of action for the
</p>
<p>furtherance and carrying out of those principles,
</p>
<p>but as to the precise construction of the detail of
</p>
<p>life in the society of the future it ventures no
</p>
<p>prophecy. The complexity of modern social
</p>
<p>conditions and our knowledge of the doctrine of

</p>
<p>evolution in general, and of its application to
</p>
<p>136 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>historical growth in particular, has taught us the
</p>
<p>futility and puerility of attempts, however well-
</p>
<p>meaning, to mechanically mould conditions of Ufe
</p>
<p>which must be dependent in great part at least
</p>
<p>upon a complex series of unforeseeable events.
</p>
<p>To criticise the draft programme above given in
</p>
<p>detail would serve no purpose. The general
</p>
<p>sentiment and view of hfe of the petit bourgeois,
</p>
<p>of the frugal, thrifty, simple-living peasant, small
</p>
<p>master, or independent craftsman, dominates the
</p>
<p>whole, as it dominated contemporary revolu-
</p>
<p>tionary thought generally. The only point that
</p>
<p>was new in the theory of the Equals, and that
</p>
<p>showed a unique foresight, at least in one respect,
</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI
</p>
<p>THE PROJECTED INSURRECTION AND ITS PLAN
</p>
<p>One of the most important of the immediate
</p>
<p>objects now to be attained was deemed to be the
</p>
<p>adhesion of a sufficient number of the military ; and
</p>
<p>indeed there was some reason for the Babouvists
</p>
<p>to hope that they might gain over a considerable
</p>
<p>contingent of the armed forces at the disposal of
</p>
<p>the government. On the success of the projected
</p>
<p>coup d'etat, the people of Paris were to elect a
</p>
<p>national assembly, clothed with supreme authority,
</p>
<p>and composed of one democrat for each depart-
</p>
<p>ment, to be nominated by the committee or "Secret
</p>
<p>Directory," which would not dissolve, but would
</p>
<p>continue to watch over the conduct of the National
</p>
<p>Assembly.
</p>
<p>Not^^dthstanding the efforts made to gain over
</p>
<p>the army, the possibility of a collision with the
</p>
<p>armed force of the government was not left out
</p>
<p>of sight. To this end members of the old Jacobin
</p>
<p>party were summoned from all over France to
</p>
<p>come to Paris and hold themselves ready for the

<p>signal of the insurrection. Lyons was especially
</p>
<p>regarded by the conspirators as a field of recruit-
</p>
<p>ment, and they were in constant communication
</p>
<p>with the former mayor of the city, Bertrand, who
</p>
<p>was untiring in stimulating the interest of the
</p>
<p>Jacobins of the city in the new movement. Mean-
</p>
<p>while, in Paris itself, secret stores of arms and
</p>
<p>ammunition were prepared, and the means of access
</p>
<p>to government stores were carefully noted.
</p>
<p>The government party, on its side, was divided
</p>
<p>into two main centres, the nouveauoc riches^ the
</p>
<p>men who had enriched themselves by the Revolu-
</p>
<p>tion, who had annexed to themselves vast portions
</p>
<p>of the wealth of the nobility and clergy, and who
</p>
<p>dreaded equally the return to the ancien regime
</p>
<p>and the ascendancy of those who might be disposed
</p>
<p>to sympathise with it, and the advent again to
</p>
<p>control of the State of the popular revolutionary
</p>
<p>forces. In either case their security of possession
</p>
<p>was threatened. Among the leaders of this party
</p>
<p>of the new wealthy middle-class, there may again
</p>
<p>be mentioned Barras, Tallien, Legendre, Freron,
</p>
<p>Merlin de Thionville, and Rewbell  as will be seen,
</p>
<p>mainly renegades of the old revolutionary party of
</p>
<p>the Mountain. In opposition to this party, which
</p>
<p>at the moment was dominant, were the Con-
</p>
<p>servatives, the sympathisers with the ancien regime^
</p>
<p>to whom had rallied many of the old moderates,

</p>
<p>and notably the former members of the Girondin
</p>
<p>THE PROJECTED INSURRECTION 189
</p>
<p>party, who had been reinstated in the Convention
</p>
<p>after Thermidor, and who formed a centre of the
</p>
<p>Conservative block, together with old men of
</p>
<p>the plain, Boissy d'Anglas, Thibaudeau, Camille
</p>
<p>Jourdan, etc. On this section of the councils
</p>
<p>the hopes of the Royalists largely rested. They
</p>
<p>were prepared, however, as a party, to adopt
</p>
<p>violent methods if they saw any chance of success
</p>
<p>in such a course. On their side the dominant
</p>
<p>faction, the party of the nouveaux riches, as I have
</p>
<p>termed them, did not hesitate, by means of orators
</p>
<p>and journalists, to denounce all opposed to them-
</p>
<p>selves as enemies of the Republic, confounding
</p>
<p>in the same category the old revolutionary party,
</p>
<p>now represented by the Babouvists, and the
</p>
<p>Royalists, who were openly plotting the restoration
</p>
<p>of the monarchy, and all it implied. Babeuf had
</p>
<p>already exposed this trick in one of the last
</p>
<p>numbers of the Tribun du Peuple.
</p>
<p>Just at this time, to complicate matters, the
</p>
<p>" Secret Directory " was confronted with a rival
</p>
<p>conspiracy on the part of certain members of the old
</p>
<p>party of the IVIountain in the Convention, who had
</p>
<p>been driven out of the latter body, and been declared
</p>
<p>ineligible for election to the new councils, and
</p>
<p>who, it was said, were taking steps to obtain control
</p>
<p>of the insurrectionary movement. The " Secret
</p>
<p>Directory " was thus placed in a position of some

<p>difficulty. Its members were indisposed to hand
</p>
<p>140 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>over the control to a miscellaneous committee of
</p>
<p>men, of some of whom the views were doubtful,
</p>
<p>and others of whom were unreliable in a political
</p>
<p>crisis, owing to weakness of character. At the
</p>
<p>same time, the fact remained that these men, all
</p>
<p>of them, had suffered from being true to the
</p>
<p>democracy ; that they were honest, and that their
</p>
<p>sympathies at least were in general sound. The
</p>
<p>Babouvist leaders therefore decided to steer a
</p>
<p>middle course. They instructed their agents to
</p>
<p>caution the populace against any movement which
</p>
<p>might emanate from these persons, and at the same
</p>
<p>time to circumvent, by warnings and otherwise,
</p>
<p>any attempts of the government to lay hands on
</p>
<p>them, attempts of which they were duly notified
</p>
<p>by their own spies in the ministry of the police.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the new democratic movement had
</p>
<p>become so menacing that both of the reactionary
</p>
<p>parties alike found it prudent to bury their hatchet,
</p>
<p>and to join forces against the common enemy.
</p>
<p>No stone was left unturned in the matter of vilifi-
</p>
<p>cation. The leaders were venal, it was said ; they
</p>
<p>aimed at throwing France into a state of anarchy,
</p>
<p>with the double object of enriching themselves by
</p>
<p>plunder in the general scramble, and of earning
</p>
<p>their wages with the Royalists by paving the way
</p>
<p>for the return of the monarchy. The calumnies
</p>
<p>were not only repeated at large by the agents of

<p>the government, but the executive Directory
</p>
<p>THE PROJECTED INSURRECTION 141
</p>
<p>emphasised them in an official manifesto. Having
</p>
<p>in this way struck terror into the minds of the
</p>
<p>timid and well-to-do population generally, but
</p>
<p>above all into the members of the two councils,
</p>
<p>on the 27th and 28th of Germinal the Directory
</p>
<p>laid two bills before the councils, embodying
</p>
<p>clauses of the most stringent character against
</p>
<p>the right of public meeting and public discussion.
</p>
<p>These drastic laws were passed the same day
</p>
<p>without modification in the Council of Five
</p>
<p>Hundred, with only a minority of twelve against
</p>
<p>them, and in the Council of the Ancients with
</p>
<p>unanimity. It now became practically impossible
</p>
<p>to carry on the work of propaganda and organisa-
</p>
<p>tion. The final struggle had already begun.
</p>
<p>Such was the state of affairs when the cry went
</p>
<p>out amongst the democrats that the day had come
</p>
<p>to live free or to die. But, however, our Babouvists'
</p>
<p>committee, the Secret Directory, hesitated even
</p>
<p>now to give the signal for action, as it was
</p>
<p>anxious to make sure of having all the threads
</p>
<p>of the movement in its hands before striking.
</p>
<p>Sufficient discipline reigned in the popular move-
</p>
<p>ment itself, combined with a sufficient confidence
</p>
<p>in the heads of the conspiracy, to prevent a pre-
</p>
<p>mature outbreak. It was evident now that the
</p>
<p>revolution would have to be accomplished by a
</p>
<p>coup de main. The design of the Secret Directory

<p>was to proceed at once to make an example of the
</p>
<p>142 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>heads of the usurping power of the executive
</p>
<p>Directory (of government), together with the
</p>
<p>whole machinery of the illegitimate constitution of
</p>
<p>the year III., the opening act of severity to be
</p>
<p>followed by an immediate amnesty. It was
</p>
<p>decided that on the day decreed for the rising to
</p>
<p>take place, banners should be distributed to the
</p>
<p>revolutionary agents, and that in the name of the
</p>
<p>Insurrectionary Committee of the " Secret Direc-
</p>
<p>tory " a proclamation should be issued threatening
</p>
<p>the death of anyone carrying out an order of the
</p>
<p>usurpatory government. Babeuf and his friends
</p>
<p>would thus place themselves at the head of the
</p>
<p>movement. Finally, after a long and earnest
</p>
<p>discussion, the following manifesto was adopted, the
</p>
<p>publication of which throughout Paris was to be
</p>
<p>the signal for the general rising. It was headed,
</p>
<p>" Act of Insurrection " {Acte Insuri'ecteur) and was
</p>
<p>as follows : 
</p>
<p>" French Democrats ! Considering that the op-
</p>
<p>pression and misery of the people has reached its
</p>
<p>height ; that the state of tyranny and misfortune
</p>
<p>is due to the actual government ;
</p>
<p>" Considering that the numerous crimes of govern-
</p>
<p>ments have always excited against them the daily
</p>
<p>and always useless complaints of the governed ;

</p>
<p>when the entire people has lost all the means
</p>
<p>guaranteeing it against despotism, it is the most
</p>
<p>courageous, the most intrepid virtue to take the
</p>
<p>initiative of insurrection, and to direct the en-
</p>
<p>franchisement of the masses ;
</p>
<p>" Considering that the ' rights of man,' recognised
</p>
<p>at the same epoch of '93, accord to the whole people,
</p>
<p>or to each of its sections, as the most sacred of
</p>
<p>rights, and the most indispensable of duties, to
</p>
<p>rise in insurrection against any government that
</p>
<p>violates its rights, and that they enjoin every free
</p>
<p>man to put to instant death those who usurp the
</p>
<p>sovereignty ;
</p>
<p>" Considering that a faction has conspired to usurp
</p>
<p>the sovereignty, in substituting its private will for
</p>
<p>the public will, freely and legally expressed in the
</p>
<p>primary assemblies of 1793, in imposing on the
</p>
<p>French people, by means of the persecution and
</p>
<p>the assassination of all the friends of liberty, an
</p>
<p>execrable code called 'the Constitution of Anno
</p>
<p>III.' (1795), in place of the democratic pact of
</p>
<p>1793, which had been accepted with so much
</p>
<p>enthusiasm ;

<p>determined rebellion against the people, since they
</p>
<p>have arrogated to themselves, in contempt of the

<p>persons and the enemies of the people, on the one

<p>hand, kings under a disguised name, and on the

<p>having outraged, abused, and destroyed the attri-

<p>after having assassinated the best friends of the

<p>THE PROJECTED INSURRECTION 151
</p>
<p>On the newly elected Assembly above spoken of
</p>
<p>being come together, it was proposed to lay before
</p>
<p>its members the following decree or proclamation :
</p>
<p>"The people of Paris, after ha^^ng destroyed
</p>
<p>" tyranny, using the rights it had received from
</p>
<p>" nature, recognises and declares to the French
</p>
<p>" people that the unequal distribution of wealth
</p>
<p>" and labour is the inexhaustible source of slavery
</p>
<p>" and pubhc ills ; that the labour of all is the one
</p>
<p>" essential condition of the social contract ; that
</p>
<p>" property in all the wealth of France resides
</p>
<p>" essentially in the French people, who alone can
</p>
<p>" determine or change its distribution ; that it
</p>
<p>" orders the National Assembly, which it has
</p>
<p>" created m the interests and in the name of all
</p>
<p>" Frenchmen, to improve the Constitution of 1793,
</p>
<p>" to prepare its prompt execution, and to assume,
</p>
<p>" by wise institutions, founded on the truths above
</p>
<p>" cited, unalterable equality, hberty, and welfare
</p>
<p>" for the French RepubUc. It enjoins the same
</p>
<p>" assembly to render an account to the nation, in
</p>
<p>" one year at latest, of the execution of the present
</p>
<p>" decree ; and finally it engages to cause the decrees
</p>
<p>" of the said Assembly to be respected in so far
</p>
<p>" as they are conformable to the above orders, and
</p>
<p>" to punish with the penalty of traitors those of
</p>
<p>" its members who shall depart from the duties
</p>
<p>" that it has prescribed for them."

</p>
<p>Such were the schemes which the Secret Direc-
</p>
<p>152 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>tory was elaborating in preparation for the rising.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the propaganda with the military made
</p>
<p>rapid progress, especially amongst the body called
</p>
<p>the " legion of police," which was supposed never
</p>
<p>to be called upon to leave Paris. This it was which
</p>
<p>specially alarmed the government, the army being
</p>
<p>the last rampart between them and the deluge.
</p>
<p>So threatening had two battalions of the " legion of
</p>
<p>police " become, that in violation of strict legality,
</p>
<p>the Directory made an order for them to be re-
</p>
<p>moved from Paris. This order, which was signed
</p>
<p>the 9th of Floreal (the 29th of April), was followed
</p>
<p>by immediate resistance, accompanied by the
</p>
<p>increase of agitation among the populace. At
</p>
<p>this moment everything seemed to favour the
</p>
<p>chances of the insurrection. The revolutionary
</p>
<p>agents suddenly became more numerous and active
</p>
<p>than ever amongst the troops. There seemed a
</p>
<p>fair chance, indeed, of gaining over the whole of
</p>
<p>the Army of the Interior, as the military forces
</p>
<p>within and around Paris were at this time called.
</p>
<p>A committee was even formed in the legion of
</p>
<p>police itself, in concert with the Secret Directory.
</p>
<p>Charles Germain was the intermediary between the
</p>
<p>two committees. A manifesto of the legion was
</p>
<p>drawn up, prepared for publication. Hundreds of
</p>
<p>democrats held themselves in readiness ; when
</p>
<p>suddenly the government, annulling the previous

</p>
<p>order, issued a new one, disbanding the insubordi-
</p>
<p>THE PROJECTED INSURRECTION 153
</p>
<p>nate battalions. Out of the members of these dis-
</p>
<p>banded battalions, mostly composed of Hebertists,
</p>
<p>a revolutionary advanced guard was formed, under
</p>
<p>the auspices of the Secret Directory.
</p>
<p>Matters now became pressing ; popular efferves-
</p>
<p>cence and impatience had reached a point where it
</p>
<p>became evident to the Secret Directory that further
</p>
<p>delay would imperil the movement. Accordingly,
</p>
<p>on the 11th of Floreal (the 1st of May) our Secret
</p>
<p>Directory convoked some military advisers, to
</p>
<p>wit, Fion, Germain, Rossignol, INIassart, and Grisel,
</p>
<p>to the last mentioned of whom much importance
</p>
<p>was attached, owing to the influence he was believed
</p>
<p>to have in the camp at Grenelle. This important
</p>
<p>meeting was attended by Babeuf, Buonarroti,
</p>
<p>Debon, Darthe, Marechal, and Didier. To the
</p>
<p>five officers was entrusted the task of directing the
</p>
<p>military side of the insurrection. They formed a
</p>
<p>committee which held its first sitting the following
</p>
<p>day at Rey's, in the Rue du Mont Blanc. Though
</p>
<p>the military committee maintained outward unity,
</p>
<p>it was known that the two conventionals, Fion and
</p>
<p>Rossignol, made no secret of regretting the absence
</p>
<p>of their old colleagues of the INIountain from the
</p>
<p>Secret Directory. From this time the meetings of
</p>
<p>the Secret Directory were transferred to a house
</p>
<p>in the Faubourg Montmartre. Again, Charles
</p>
<p>Germain was the intermediary between the latter

</p>
<p>and the military committee.
</p>
<p>154 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>Long and earnest discussions took place at this
</p>
<p>committee as to the conduct of the insurrection.
</p>
<p>The views of tried revolutionaries from the " legion
</p>
<p>of police" were heard. One proposition was to
</p>
<p>enlist the Royalists in the task of overthrowing the
</p>
<p>executive Directory, but this was at once rejected.
</p>
<p>Another was by two officers of the legion to poignard
</p>
<p>that very night the members of the (governmental)
</p>
<p>Directory, and thus inaugurate the rising. But the
</p>
<p>want of money at this moment hampered the actions
</p>
<p>of the conspirators in various directions, while at
</p>
<p>the same time the question of the old deputies of
</p>
<p>the Mountain caused much embarrassment. As we
</p>
<p>have seen, Fion and Rossignol were very dissatisfied
</p>
<p>at the Mountainist committee being left out in
</p>
<p>the cold. Much discussion took place in the
</p>
<p>Secret Directory upon this question, Germain
</p>
<p>counselling concessions. An amalgamation of the
</p>
<p>two committees was out of the question.
</p>
<p>On the 15th of Floreal, Germain brought to the
</p>
<p>Secret Directory a delegate from the Mountainist
</p>
<p>Committee, Ricord. The whole situation was
</p>
<p>explained to him, the " Act of Insurrection," already
</p>
<p>given, was handed to the JMountainist deputy to
</p>
<p>read, and a discussion was entered into concerning
</p>
<p>the modifications to be made, especially in the
</p>
<p>article respecting the provisional authority. It was
</p>
<p>agreed that the old Mountainists of the Convention

<p>should form part of the supreme power, but only
</p>
<p>THE PROJECTED INSURRECTION 155
</p>
<p>on condition of their giving irrefragable guarantees
</p>
<p>of the purity of their democratic aims.
</p>
<p>The conditions as agreed to finally between Ricord
</p>
<p>and the Secret Directory were :  1. The reinstate-
</p>
<p>ment of the sixty proscribed Mountainist members
</p>
<p>of the National Convention in the governing body,
</p>
<p>which was to consist, in addition, as provided for in
</p>
<p>the Act of Insurrection, of one democrat for every
</p>
<p>department, to be elected by the people, on the
</p>
<p>nomination of the Secret Directory. 2. The dis-
</p>
<p>positions of article 18 of the Act of Insurrection to
</p>
<p>be carried out without reserve and immediately.
</p>
<p>3. The decrees issued by the people of Paris on
</p>
<p>the day of insurrection to be submitted to. 4. The
</p>
<p>suspension of all laws and ordinances made since
</p>
<p>the 9th of Thermidor, year II. 5. The expulsion
</p>
<p>of all the returned emigrants. Ricord, who accepted
</p>
<p>these conditions, then left to submit them to his
</p>
<p>colleagues of the JNIountainist committee. The
</p>
<p>next day he returned to announce their rejection
</p>
<p>of the terms offered. What they required was in
</p>
<p>effect the reinstallation, on the success of the
</p>
<p>insurrection, of the sixty proscribed deputies of
</p>
<p>the Mountain, without any guarantees or conditions
</p>
<p>whatever. The addition of a democrat for every
</p>
<p>department was rejected by the proscribed deputies
</p>
<p>as a violation of the national sovereignty, which
</p>
<p>they claimed, under the existing circumstances,

</p>
<p>resided in their own body alone. The rejoinder
</p>
<p>156 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>of the Secret Directory to this response was
</p>
<p>interesting : " In agreeing to the provisional re-
</p>
<p>establishment of a part of the Convention, we only
</p>
<p>seek to serve the people. The only recompense to
</p>
<p>which we aspire is the complete triumph of
</p>
<p>Equality. We shall fight and expose our lives
</p>
<p>to give back to the people the fulness of its rights,
</p>
<p>but we cannot conceive that anyone has the right
</p>
<p>to claim to be generous towards the master of
</p>
<p>everything. If you really desire to work with us
</p>
<p>in the great enterprise we have in view, take care
</p>
<p>lest you put forward propositions and make offers
</p>
<p>which throw a bad light upon your intentions."
</p>
<p>This referred to some phrases in the reply of the
</p>
<p>Mountainist committee, intimating its willingness
</p>
<p>to satisfy the social demands of the Babouvists, but
</p>
<p>rather as an act of grace than as the recognition of
</p>
<p>a right.
</p>
<p>"Many of your colleagues have betrayed the
</p>
<p>confidence of the people, and we should be infinitely
</p>
<p>more reprehensible than they if we consented to
</p>
<p>again deliver the people over to their passions and
</p>
<p>their weaknesses. In order to re-establish the
</p>
<p>sovereignty of the people, we ought not to employ
</p>
<p>the instruments which have caused its loss. It is
</p>
<p>to those in whom the nation expects the destruction
</p>
<p>of tyranny that it necessarily delegates the right to
</p>
<p>take the provisional and indispensable measures to
</p>
<p>this end. We will not destroy an oppressive

<p>government in order to substitute for it another
</p>
<p>equally so. It is well to pardon error, but it would
</p>
<p>be folly to confide once more the future of the
</p>
<p>country to those whose errors have lost it. Better
</p>
<p>to perish by the hands of the patriots who, indig-

</p>
<p>and who since then have basely allowed republicans
</p>
<p>to be proscribed, and the democratic edifice to be
</p>
<p>demohshed."
</p>
<p>Ricord again retired to communicate this defini-
</p>
<p>tive resolution to his friends. It was on the 18th
</p>
<p>Floreal (7th May) that Darthe reported to the
</p>
<p>Secret Directory concerning a meeting of the
</p>
<p>Mountainist committee at which he had been
</p>
<p>present, that, after a violent debate, the addition of
</p>
<p>one democrat for every department, as weU as the

<p>clauses respecting social legislation, had been agreed
</p>
<p>to, after strong speeches in their favour from the
</p>
<p>old committeemen of the Convention, Amar, and
</p>
<p>especially Robert Lindet, both of whom strongly
</p>
<p>championed the position taken up by the Secret
</p>
<p>Directory. The news of the entente between the two
</p>
<p>organising bodies was immediately communicated
</p>
<p>to the agents of Babeuf and his colleagues, and re-

</p>
<p>newed activity was shown in hastening on the crisis.
</p>
<p>158 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>There were now three bodies concerned in
</p>
<p>organising the insurrection  the INIountainist Com-
</p>
<p>mittee, the Secret Directory, and the Military-
</p>
<p>Committee appointed by the latter. The arrange-
</p>
<p>ments proposed by the Military Committee,
</p>
<p>and accepted by the others, were, that the insur-
</p>
<p>rection should take place in the daytime, that
</p>
<p>the generals under the orders of the Secret
</p>
<p>Directory should lead the people against the
</p>
<p>enemy, that the insurgents should be divided
</p>
<p>according to their arrondissement and subdivided
</p>
<p>by section ; that each arrondissement should have
</p>
<p>its chief, and each section its sub-chief; and finally,
</p>
<p>that all subordination to the existing authorities
</p>
<p>should be broken off, and every act recognising
</p>
<p>their legitimacy punished with instant death. For
</p>
<p>the final ratification of these conditions and
</p>
<p>settling of details, a general meeting of the three
</p>
<p>committees was called together on the evening of
</p>
<p>the 19th of Floreal (8th of May), at the house of
</p>
<p>Drouet, in the Place des Piques.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, wholly unsuspected by his colleagues,
</p>
<p>a traitor had been working alongside of them, George
</p>
<p>Grisel, of the Grenelle camp, who, as member of the
</p>
<p>military committee, had taken part in the innermost
</p>
<p>counsels of the conspiracy. Grisel, it would appear,
</p>
<p>had for some days been in communication with the
</p>
<p>(governmental) Directory in the person of Carnot.

<p>A written denunciation of the proceedings of the
</p>
<p>THE PROJECTED INSURRECTION 159
</p>
<p>Secret Directory by Grisel, the 15th Floreal (4th
</p>
<p>May), exists, in which precise details are given of
</p>
<p>the latest meetings, notably that of the 11th of
</p>
<p>Floreal, at which he himself had been presented by
</p>
<p>Darthe to Babeuf and the others. The traitor, in
</p>
<p>professing to give an account of the " Act of
</p>
<p>Insurrection," entirely perverts its sense, depicting
</p>
<p>Babeuf as a bloodthirsty tiger, enjoining the whole-
</p>
<p>sale massacre of the rich. He emphasises the part
</p>
<p>played by Drouet in the conspiracy, and discloses
</p>
<p>the plan of attack against the Directory, the
</p>
<p>Councils, and the Etat major.
</p>
<p>In consequence of these disclosures, Carnot, on
</p>
<p>the 17th of Floreal, submitted to the Directory
</p>
<p>a list of 245 persons against whom he wished
</p>
<p>to issue mandates of arrest, as the heads of
</p>
<p>the dangerous conspiracy. Amongst the names
</p>
<p>given were, of course, all those with whom the
</p>
<p>reader is by this time familiar. The proposition
</p>
<p>was agreed to by the Directory, and on the
</p>
<p>19th Floreal the mandates of arrest were issued.
</p>
<p>Of those against whom the mandates were
</p>
<p>launched, thirty-five of them were singled out,
</p>
<p>amongst whom was Buonarroti, to be brought
</p>
<p>before the Minister of Police, in order to be
</p>
<p>interrogated concerning the facts of the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Grisel, it should be said, made himself notable for
</p>
<p>the vehemence of his democratic sentiments, and

</p>
<p>for the boldness of the measures he proposed. He
</p>
<p>160 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>was never tired of affirming the devotion of the
</p>
<p>soldiers at Crenelle to the democratic principles
</p>
<p>animating the movement. The government at
</p>
<p>once took steps to execute the warrants. By a
</p>
<p>mistake, the residence of Ricord w^as descended
</p>
<p>upon on the 18th Floreal, but no one was found
</p>
<p>there. But Grisel's information as regards the
</p>
<p>following day was unfortunately only too correct.
</p>
<p>As a member of the military committee, he was
</p>
<p>able to give the government precise information as
</p>
<p>to the place and time of the meeting of the 19th
</p>
<p>(Floreal), though, as events showed, ovdng to
</p>
<p>clumsily given instructions, the project of the
</p>
<p>government again miscarried.
</p>
<p>The meeting at the house of Drouet took place,
</p>
<p>and lasted from eight in the evening until a
</p>
<p>quarter to eleven. Babeuf, Buonarroti, Darthe,
</p>
<p>Didier, Fion, Massart, Rossignol, Robert Lindet,
</p>
<p>Drouet, Ricord, Langelot, and Jauveux were
</p>
<p>present, and, in addition, the infamous Grisel.
</p>
<p>A member of the Secret Directory opened the
</p>
<p>proceedings with an eloquent adjuration to those
</p>
<p>present in the traditional style of eighteenth-
</p>

<p>INIountain, as the Convention insisted on the
</p>
<p>THE PROJECTED INSURRECTION 161
</p>
<p>necessity of impressing the stamp of the most
</p>
<p>strict equahty upon the Revolution, and of giving
</p>
<p>it a thoroughly popular character. Grisel then
</p>
<p>rose. " As for me," he said, " I speak for my brave
</p>
<p>comrades of the camp of Crenelle ; and to show you
</p>
<p>how I take to heart the triumph of Equality, I will
</p>
<p>tell you that I have succeeded in extracting from
</p>
<p>my aristocrat uncle the sum of 10,000 li^Tcs
</p>
<p>(francs), which I intend to devote to procuring
</p>
<p>refreshments for the insurgent soldiers." The Act
</p>
<p>of Insurrection, as amended, was formally approved
</p>
<p>by the ^lountainists, who by their delegates pro-
</p>
<p>mised on the day of insurrection to repair to the
</p>
<p>place that might be indicated by the Secret
</p>
<p>Directory, and sincerely to co-operate in the
</p>
<p>common work. Massart, in the name of the
</p>
<p>IMilitary Committee, explained the basis of the
</p>
<p>plan of attack proposed. The twelve arrondisse-
</p>
<p>ments of Paris, united in three di\asions, should be
</p>
<p>marched by as many generals upon the legislative
</p>
<p>bodies, the executive Directory, and the Etat major
</p>
<p>of the Army of the Interior. The advanced guard
</p>
<p>was to be formed of the most ardent democrats.
</p>
<p>He added that the committee required further
</p>
<p>information of the numbers of the insurgents and
</p>
<p>of the capacity of some of them ; also as to the
</p>
<p>places where arms and ammunition were stored,
</p>
<p>which it would be necessary to seize at the first
</p>
<p>start-ofF. The meeting decided that the Secret

</p>
<p>Directory should hasten the denoument of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy ; that it should give its agents instruc-
</p>
<p>tions conformably to the plan of the Military
</p>
<p>Committee ; that it should meet again two days
</p>
<p>later and hear a final report on the state of affairs
</p>
<p>and fix a day for the movement.
</p>
<p>The meeting had not long been dissolved before
</p>
<p>the Minister of Police, with a detachment of infantry
</p>
<p>and cavalry at his heels, in defiance of the law which
</p>
<p>forbade domiciliary visits during the night, broke
</p>
<p>into the house, but found only Drouet and Darthe
</p>
<p>there, whom he did not consider it prudent to arrest
</p>
<p>by themselves. He accordingly withdrew with his
</p>
<p>escort. The event, notwithstanding, as might be
</p>
<p>imagined, at once aroused suspicion of treachery,
</p>
<p>which for the moment fell unfairly enough, as
</p>
<p>Buonarroti informs us, on Charles Germain, owing
</p>
<p>to the fact of his absence from the meeting on the
</p>
<p>occasion in question,  an absence caused by a
</p>
<p>prosecution having already been begun against
</p>
<p>him. But the astute Grisel soon succeeded in
</p>
<p>explaining away the occurrence, and fatally
</p>
<p>allaying all suspicion. He used the blundering
</p>
<p>proceeding of the government in making their
</p>
<p>raid after the meeting was over, and the fact that
</p>
<p>they had not taken action at the meeting of the
</p>
<p>previous week, when they were all assembled at the
</p>
<p>house where Babeuf was lodging, and where all the

<p>documents relating to the movement were kept, as
</p>
<p>THE PROJECTED INSURRECTION 163
</p>
<p>an argument to prove that the raid was not due to
</p>
<p>any internal treachery, but a piece of official bluff on
</p>
<p>the part of the Minister of Police to single out old
</p>
<p>Mountainists known to be disaffected to the existing
</p>
<p>government as the object of his domiciliary visit.
</p>
<p>The insurrection, as represented by the Secret
</p>
<p>Directory, with the allied committees, had at this
</p>
<p>moment at its disposal, on a careful estimate made,
</p>
<p>as Babeuf and his friends show, about 17,000 men,
</p>
<p>upon whom absolute reliance could be placed.
</p>
<p>These were composed of the most military members
</p>
<p>of the old revolutionary sections, disbanded members
</p>
<p>of the Army of the Interior, revolutionaries of the
</p>
<p>departments come to Paris to join in the movement,
</p>
<p>almost the whole of the legion of police, the grena-
</p>
<p>diers of the legislative body, and the corps consigned
</p>
<p>at the Invalides ; this formed the nucleus of the
</p>
<p>revolutionary army. But, in addition, the leaders
</p>
<p>of the movement, of course, reckoned upon the
</p>
<p>popular masses of St Marceau and St Antoine, and,
</p>
<p>in fact, large numbers of the lower-middle and
</p>
<p>working class throughout Paris, to join in the
</p>
<p>movement when once set on foot. The desperate
</p>
<p>economic situation of such, they assumed, must
</p>
<p>inevitably drive large numbers into a revolt, the
</p>
<p>first aim of which was an economic revolution that
</p>
<p>would make an end, not merely of the existing state
</p>
<p>of things, but of poverty itself, as the inevitable

<p>CHAPTER VII
</p>
<p>THE CATASTROPHE
</p>
<p>During the course of the events described in the
</p>
<p>last chapter, that is, between the 1st and the 10th
</p>
<p>of May 1796, it has been proved by recent re-
</p>
<p>searches that the government, namely, the executive
</p>
<p>Directory, together with the Minister of Police,
</p>
<p>was kept fully informed of everything important
</p>
<p>that was taking place. We have already spoken
</p>
<p>of Grisel, the government spy, who was in the
</p>
<p>innermost councils of the Babouvist Committee, or
</p>
<p>Secret Directory, as it was called, and himself a
</p>
<p>member of the Military Committee, upon which the
</p>
<p>task of drawing up and carrying out the plan of the
</p>
<p>insurrection devolved. But it would appear that,
</p>
<p>although perhaps the principal, he was by no means
</p>
<p>the only agent to keep the authorities au courant
</p>
<p>with the progress of the insurrectionary movement.
</p>
<p>In addition to the ordinary police spies, of which
</p>
<p>there were the usual contingent of eavesdroppers, in
</p>
<p>caf^s or elsewhere, where political questions were
</p>
<p>likely to be canvassed, there were undoubtedly

<p>164
</p>
<p>THE CATASTROPHE 165
</p>
<p>other more important sources of information as to
</p>
<p>the places of assembly and the actions of the chiefs
</p>
<p>of the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Among the principal informers was the keeper
</p>
<p>of the Cafe des Bains Chinois, which was a
</p>
<p>rendezvous of the Babouvists and those favour-
</p>
<p>able to the movement. Of especial interest,
</p>
<p>as regards the relations of the government and
</p>
<p>the insurrectionary movement of Babeuf and his
</p>
<p>colleagues, is the question of the part played by
</p>
<p>Barras, who was the most influential of the five
</p>
<p>Directors, and the most prominent man at the time.
</p>
<p>Buonarroti states, in general terms, that Barras had
</p>
<p>coquetted with the Babouvists, but does not give
</p>
<p>particulars. In fact, for long the precise relations
</p>
<p>between Barras and the movement remained in
</p>
<p>historical obscurity. In a recent work, however
</p>
<p>{Histoire et Droit, 1907, vol. i. pp. 267-293),
</p>
<p>M. Paul Robriquet has collected evidence of
</p>
<p>the part played by Barras in the affair, including
</p>
<p>some unpublished documents in the Archives
</p>
<p>nationales. The next strongest man to Barras on
</p>
<p>the Directory was Carnot, and between these two
</p>
<p>men was implacable discord, which culminated later
</p>
<p>in the affair of the " 18th Fructidor." Hippolyte
</p>
<p>Carnot, the son of the famous " organiser of victory,"
</p>
<p>in his memoirs of his father, alludes to the com-
</p>
<p>plicity of Barras in the matter of the " Equals,"

</p>
<p>thinking that it was only the timely arrest of
</p>
<p>166 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>Babeuf and his friends that averted catastrophe
</p>
<p>(i.e. from the point of view of the government
</p>
<p>and the dominant classes). In confirmation of
</p>
<p>this, M. Robriquet cites a letter he has discovered,
</p>
<p>signed by one Armand, who was evidently a police
</p>
<p>agent, to the Minister of Police, containing the
</p>
<p>words, " I am persuaded that Barras is betraying
</p>
<p>us, for he has interviews with Rossignol " ; and
</p>
<p>later, in another letter, "the director Barras is
</p>
<p>more than ever suspect to me. He has had
</p>
<p>Rossignol informed that he begs the Committee
</p>
<p>of Insurrection to send him ' a confidential man,'
</p>
<p>because, says he, 'the moment of the insurrec-
</p>
<p>tion,' he wishes to pass over to the Faubourg
</p>
<p>St Antoine with a part of the JEtat major,'''
</p>
<p>explaining, however, at the same time, that in
</p>
<p>case the committee does not send him the man
</p>
<p>he asks for, he would, none the less, "throw
</p>
<p>himself into the arms of the people."
</p>
<p>The same author quotes, further, a letter of
</p>
<p>Charles Germain to Babeuf, relative to an inter-
</p>
<p>view he had had with Barras on the 30th
</p>
<p>Germinal, anno IV. (19th April 1796). "You
</p>
<p>ought to know from Darthe or others," writes
</p>
<p>Germain, " that I was sent for by Barras this
</p>
<p>morning, the 30th of Germinal. I have had an
</p>
<p>audience with the director." Germain goes on
</p>
<p>to give a statement of his conversation with

</p>
<p>Barras, as much as possible in the language used.
</p>
<p>THE CATASTROPHE 167
</p>
<p>After enlarging on the dangers the country ran
</p>
<p>from the RoyaUsts, Barras asked his visitor
</p>
<p>what the patriots thought. " We know," he said,
</p>
<p>"they are preparing a movement. Good men,
</p>
<p>their zeal has bhnded them ; they are going to get
</p>
<p>themselves prairialised, whereas, in order to save
</p>
<p>the country, we have got to vendemiarise.'' This,
</p>
<p>of course, referred to the abortive insurrection of
</p>
<p>the populace on the 1st of Prairial of the previous
</p>
<p>year, when the Convention was invaded, but which,
</p>
<p>after a few hours' triumph, was suppressed, and
</p>
<p>which led to the expulsion and indictment of the
</p>
<p>Mountainist section of the Convention for having
</p>
<p>supported the demands of the insurgents. Barras
</p>
<p>opposes this to his own exploits, with the aid
</p>
<p>of Napoleon and his cannon, on the 13th of
</p>
<p>Vendemiaire, when the Royalist insurrection w^as
</p>
<p>suppressed.
</p>
<p>Here follows a remarkable utterance of Barras,
</p>
<p>as reported by Germain : " Like you," Barras is
</p>
<p>alleged to say, " I know myself that the present
</p>
<p>state of things is not the end which was contemplated
</p>
<p>by the men who overthrew the Bastille, the Throne,
</p>
<p>and Robespierre. Like you, I recognise myself
</p>
<p>that a change must be made, and that this change
</p>
<p>is not so far away as some might think ; and when
</p>
<p>one has the most need of patriots to effect this
</p>
<p>change, they are meditating our ruin, our death !

</p>
<p>perhaps, the instruments of the emigrants, the
</p>
<p>fanatics, the RoyaKsts, who have ever seen the
</p>
<p>restored monarchy near at hand." Barras con-
</p>
<p>tinued, alluding to the pretended complicity of the
</p>
<p>Babouvists with the Royalists in their intrigues
</p>
<p>with Pitt and Cobourg,and wound up by challenging
</p>
<p>Germain to give his own opinion. The latter
</p>
<p>replied, denying any knowledge of the alleged
</p>
<p>intrigues with Cobourg, Pitt, Isnard, Robert, etc.,
</p>
<p>but assuring the Director that the people was
</p>
<p>tired of its oppressors, and would be no more
</p>
<p>satisfied with a Vendemiaire than with a Prairial,
</p>
<p>the former having proved of no more benefit to
</p>
<p>them than the latter. Barras, here interrupting
</p>
<p>him, expressed regret at not having worked the
</p>
<p>oracle ("travaille la marchandise "), if for only
</p>
<p>three days, in a manner to satisfy the patriots.
</p>
<p>He then launched forth into an invective against
</p>
<p>the Royalists, expressing the wish that the move-
</p>
<p>ment might become general and be directed against
</p>
<p>the Royalists. " I have confidence," he exclaimed,
</p>
<p>"in the means at my disposal." He then went
</p>
<p>on to relate that he had lately made an excur-
</p>
<p>sion through the popular faubourgs, and that the
</p>
<p>people all appeared calm and peaceable. "If I
</p>
<p>had seen anything stirring," he said, "the thing
</p>
<p>would have been done. I should have marched
</p>
<p>with the people, for it is by and through the people

<p>that, as 1 hold, the national will manifests itself.
</p>
<p>THE CATASTROPHE 169
</p>
<p>The people," he added, " is not represented by a
</p>
<p>handful of clumsy agitators." He thereupon re-
</p>
<p>newed his suggestions that the Babouvists should
</p>
<p>rally round the Directory rather than maintain a
</p>
<p>secret directory of their own, in opposition to the
</p>
<p>governmental one. "You cry out," said Barras,
</p>
<p>" against us, Crucify them ! and yet to whom do
</p>
<p>you propose to attach yourselves ? To the Court
</p>
<p>of Verona ! Yes, my friends, it is thither that they
</p>
<p>want to lead you, whereas that is the very thing
</p>
<p>we have to kill and destroy. You ought now, my
</p>
<p>comrade," said he, " to know my mind, my senti-
</p>
<p>ment, and my principles. More than one patriot
</p>
<p>knows me already ; my existence is bound up in
</p>
<p>that of the Repubhc and the people. Believe me,
</p>
<p>that, like all true patriots, I shall neglect nothing
</p>
<p>for their success ; and it is only in order to serve
</p>
<p>them that I resist my ovm pressing inclination to
</p>
<p>abdicate my position, and to retire peacefully into
</p>
<p>an obscurity which is very dear to me." Barras,
</p>
<p>in bidding good-bye to Germain, invited him to
</p>
<p>come and see him from time to time, giving him
</p>
<p>a carte de circulation to facilitate his movements
</p>
<p>in official regions.
</p>
<p>Barras admits in his memoirs that he had received
</p>
<p>Germain sometimes, but denies absolutely that he
</p>
<p>had any relations whatever with Babeuf himself,
</p>
<p>whom, he states, he regarded as a great fool. He

</p>
<p>naturally was afterwards anxious to excuse himself
</p>
<p>170 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>from the suspicion of having actively favoured the
</p>
<p>movement of the Equals, but the testimony of
</p>
<p>others, among whom was Buonarroti, was to the
</p>
<p>effect that Barras had actually offered his services
</p>
<p>to "the conspiracy," w^iich certainly seems to be
</p>
<p>confirmed by the letter above quoted from, and
</p>
<p>which indeed, even apart from this, might be
</p>
<p>inferred from the admission of Barras himself, that
</p>
<p>he had " sometimes received " the ardent Germain.
</p>
<p>The fellow - director of Barras, Larivelliere-
</p>
<p>Lepeaux, certainly held strongly to the opinion of
</p>
<p>his having negotiated with the conspirators. " The
</p>
<p>conduct of Barras," he says, " his relations, his sinis-
</p>
<p>ter look, his opinions, sufficed to convince us." He
</p>
<p>also states that this was the opinion of the other
</p>
<p>directors, and that so strongly were they impressed
</p>
<p>with the unreliability of their colleague, that the
</p>
<p>measures to be taken against the conspiracy were
</p>
<p>only discussed when Barras happened to be absent
</p>
<p>from the directorial sittings.
</p>
<p>That Barras, from what we know of the man,
</p>
<p>was not actuated by disinterested enthusiasm or
</p>
<p>regard for principle in his attitude may be taken
</p>
<p>for granted, though what precisely his "game"
</p>
<p>was is not quite clear, any more than as to
</p>
<p>whether Napoleon was privy to it or not. It
</p>
<p>would seem, however, pretty evident that, not-
</p>
<p>withstanding the aggressive luxury of his private

<p>life, a luxury that had alienated many, as also

<p>THE CATASTROPHE 171
</p>
<p>the role he had played as a Thermidorean, he
</p>
<p>thought he might attain an influence with the
</p>
<p>revolutionary party by avowedly favouring their
</p>
<p>aims on the one side, while playing up to the
</p>
<p>representatives of property and the status quo on
</p>
<p>the other by posing as a man of moderating
</p>
<p>counsels. Whether Bonaparte knew of the matter,
</p>
<p>and had visions of a forestalled 18th of Brumaire,
</p>
<p>and an entry upon the scene as the saviour of
</p>
<p>society, as already said, cannot be determined for
</p>
<p>certain.
</p>
<p>However this may be, and whatever the motives
</p>
<p>underlying the attitude of Barras, there is no
</p>
<p>doubt whatever of his haste to adopt an " I know
</p>
<p>not the man" attitude so soon as he saw the
</p>
<p>way things were turning. The moment he was
</p>
<p>apprised of the imminent arrest of the Babouvist
</p>
<p>leaders, and perceived that the movement was lost,
</p>
<p>he made a violent scene with his colleagues, ex-
</p>
<p>tracting from them a declaration that they had given
</p>
<p>no credence to the reports of his treachery circu-
</p>
<p>lated by malevolents. At the same time he talked
</p>
<p>of appearing before the Council of Five Hundred,
</p>
<p>in order to obtain a public satisfaction. Not caring
</p>
<p>to show a divided counsel at a moment of peril, the
</p>
<p>other Directors calmed Barras, assuring him that
</p>
<p>they had no thought of bringing any accusation
</p>
<p>against him.

<p>On the 10th of xMay (21st Floreal, anno IV.),
</p>
<p>172 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>Carnot, who was president of the executive
</p>
<p>Directory, sent a message to the Council of Five
</p>
<p>Hundred to inform them that a horrible plot was
</p>
<p>to be hatched on the morrow, and that its object
</p>
<p>was "to overthrow the French Constitution, to
</p>
<p>slaughter the legislative body, all the members of
</p>
<p>the government, the Etat major of the Army of
</p>
<p>the Interior, and to deliver this great city to general
</p>
<p>pillage and frightful massacres." It concluded
</p>
<p>with the information that the executive Directory
</p>
<p>were informed of the place of meeting of the chiefs
</p>
<p>of this conspiracy, and had given orders for their
</p>
<p>immediate arrest. The same day, indeed, at the
</p>
<p>very moment when the Secret Directory was
</p>
<p>planning the final arrangements for the insurrec-
</p>
<p>tion, a body of soldiers invaded the room where
</p>

<p>leaders, amongst them being the ex-con ventionals be-
</p>

<p>revolutionary party  Vadier, Ricord, Laignelot, and
</p>
<p>Drouet. Babeuf himself, however, was not there,
</p>
<p>neither was he to be found at his old address,
</p>
<p>No. 29 Faubourg St Honore, but at the house of
</p>
<p>the tailor Tissot, No. 21 Rue de la Grande
</p>
<p>Truanderie, where the meeting of the 11th of
</p>
<p>Floreal was held, and where, as before related, he
</p>
<p>had taken refuge as a measure of precaution,
</p>
<p>which events proved was ineffectual.

<p>At the moment that the police burst into his

</p>
<p>apartment he was engaged in drawing up, in com-
</p>
<p>pany with Buonarroti and another, the manifestoes
</p>
<p>intended to determine the hnes of the insurrection.
</p>
<p>All the important papers relating to the movement
</p>
<p>were seized. In spite of the generosity of the
</p>
<p>one man of means in the party, Le Pelletier,^ there
</p>
<p>was only found in ready cash 2000 livres in
</p>
<p>assignats. What this amounted to in the depreci-
</p>
<p>ated currency of the time is easy to reckon. The
</p>
<p>poverty, indeed, of the movement threatened to
</p>
<p>cause its failure, even had it not been prema-
</p>
<p>turely betrayed. Without the co-operation of
</p>
<p>the military, or at least a considerable section of
</p>
<p>them, it was impossible that the insurrection
</p>
<p>could have succeeded ; and to ensure the support
</p>
<p>of the military, it was necessary that they should
</p>
<p>be paid. It was proposed to divide the insurgent
</p>
<p>army into three divisions ; three generals were to
</p>
<p>command it, under the order of the general-in-
</p>
<p>chief. Fion, Germain, Rossignol, and iNIassart
</p>
<p>were those designated. All was arranged up to
</p>
<p>the moment when the tocsin should ring out, and
</p>
<p>when, at the beat of the generale, the popular

<p>wards of the city would rise to claim the heritage

</p>
<p>174 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>immediately produced a great sensation on the
</p>
<p>general public.
</p>
<p>The press gave blood-curdling accounts of the
</p>
<p>projected movement and the objects of the still-
</p>
<p>born insurrection. Every day brought reports
</p>
<p>of fresh arrests of the insurrectionists, besides
</p>
<p>those of Royalists and others. Babeuf and his
</p>
<p>friends were removed at once to imprisonment
</p>
<p>in the Temple. All w^ere apparently at first
</p>
<p>taken to the prison of the Abbaye. This v^^as on
</p>
<p>the 21st Floreal (10th May). Brought up the
</p>
<p>same day before the Minister of Police, Charles
</p>
<p>Cochon Laparent, a former member of the Con-
</p>
<p>vention, Babeuf claimed to be the author of the
</p>
<p>plan of insurrection found among the papers seized.
</p>
<p>This was, of course, not strictly true, but Babeuf
</p>
<p>was anxious not to incriminate his associates, whom
</p>
<p>he steadily refused to name. Two days later he
</p>
<p>indicted the following letter to the executive
</p>
<p>Directory : 
</p>
<p>"Citizens and Directors,  Would you regard
</p>
<p>it as beneath you to treat with me as between
</p>
<p>power and power? You have already seen the
</p>
<p>vast confidence of which I am the centre ! You
</p>
<p>have seen that my party may well balance yours !
</p>
<p>You have seen its vast ramifications ! I am more
</p>
<p>than convinced that the outlook has made you
</p>
<p>tremble !

<p>" Is it to your interest, is it to the interest of
</p>
<p>THE CATASTROPHE 175
</p>
<p>the country, to give special notoriety to the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy and its inspirers ? I do not think so. I
</p>
<p>will give you the reasons why my opinion ought
</p>
<p>not to appear suspicious. What would happen if
</p>
<p>this affair should appear in the full light of day ?
</p>
<p>That I should play the most glorious of all roles !
</p>
<p>I should demonstrate with all the force of character,
</p>
<p>with all the energy of which you have known me
</p>
<p>to be possessed, the righteousness of the conspiracy,
</p>
<p>of which I never denied having been the ringleader.
</p>
<p>Departing from that cowardly path strewn with
</p>
<p>denials, which the common ruck of accused persons
</p>
<p>use to justify themselves, I should dare to develop
</p>
<p>great principles, plead the eternal rights of the
</p>
<p>people, with all the advantage which close absorp-
</p>
<p>tion and the grandeur of the subject gives me.
</p>
<p>I should dare, I say, to demonstrate that this trial
</p>
<p>is not one of justice, but it is one of strength
</p>
<p>against weakness, of oppressors against oppressed
</p>
<p>and their magnanimous defenders, of the strong
</p>
<p>against the weak. You may condemn me to
</p>
<p>deportation or death, but your judgment will be at
</p>
<p>once seen to be pronounced by powerful vice
</p>
<p>against feeble virtue. INly scaffold will figure
</p>
<p>gloriously beside that of Barneveldt or of Sidney.
</p>
<p>Would you fear to see, after my execution, altars
</p>
<p>raised to me beside those where to-day Robespieire
</p>
<p>and Goujon are revered as illustrious martyrs ?

<p>It is not in this way that governments and rulers

<p>176 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>are rendered secure. You have seen, citizens and
</p>
<p>directors, that you hold nothing when I am in
</p>
<p>your hands. I am not all the conspiracy, it is
</p>
<p>clear; nay, I am only a single link in the long
</p>
<p>chain that composes it. You have to fear all the
</p>
<p>other parties no less than mine. You have, indeed,
</p>
<p>the proof of all the interest they take in me, that
</p>
<p>you strike at them all in striking at me, and you

<p>will irritate them.

<p>" You will irritate, I say, the whole democracy
</p>
<p>of the French Republic. But you know already
</p>
<p>that it is not such a small matter as you may have

<p>imagined at first. You must recognise that it is
</p>
<p>not only in Paris that it exists in strength, you
</p>
<p>must see that there is not one of the departments
</p>
<p>where it is not powerful. You would judge of the
</p>
<p>matter still better if your agents had seized the
</p>
<p>vast correspondence which enabled us to form the
</p>
<p>Hsts of which you have only seen a fragment. It
</p>
<p>is all very well to seek to stifle the sacred fire

<p>which burns and will burn. What though it seems

<p>at certain instants extinguished if its flame threatens

<p>to revive suddenly with the force of an explosion ?

<p>to that vast sans-culotte sect which has not yet

<p>same position as he who after the death of
</p>
<p>THE CATASTROPHE 177
</p>
<p>Cromwell ruled some millions of English re-
</p>
<p>publicans. Charles II. was king, and whatever
</p>
<p>you may say you are not that yet. You have
</p>
<p>need of a party to support you, and if you removed
</p>
<p>that of the patriots you are left alone in the face of
</p>
<p>royalism. What do you think would be your
</p>
<p>lookout if you were standing before it single-
</p>
<p>handed ? You will say that the patriots are as
</p>
<p>dangerous as the royalists, and perhaps more so.
</p>
<p>You deceive yourselves. Consider well the char-
</p>
<p>acter of the enterprise of the patriots. You will
</p>
<p>not find that they desire your death, and it is a
</p>
<p>calumny to have allowed the statement to be
</p>
<p>published. For myself, I can tell you that they
</p>
<p>do not desire it. They wish to walk in other paths
</p>
<p>than those of Robespierre. They desire no blood.
</p>
<p>They would force you to confess of yourselves that
</p>
<p>you have made an oppressive use of power, that you
</p>
<p>have got rid of all popular forms and safeguards,
</p>
<p>and they desire you to replace them. They would

<p>promised after Vendemiaire, you had made the

<p>attempt to govern popularly.

<p>have sought to open the door to you. I have said

<p>how I thought that you might cover yourselves

<p>with the blessing of the people. I explained how

<p>it seemed possible to me that you might cause to

<p>your government exhibits in contrast to true

<p>republican principles.
</p>
<p>" Well, there is still time. The turn the latest
</p>
<p>events have taken may become profitable, and the
</p>
<p>salvation alike of yourselves and the public
</p>
<p>interests. Do you disdain my advice and my
</p>
<p>conclusions, which are that your own interest and
</p>
<p>that of the country consists in not giving notoriety
</p>
<p>to the present affair ? I seem to perceive that it
</p>
<p>is already your intention to treat the matter
</p>
<p>politically. It seems to me that you would be
</p>
<p>wise in doing so. Don't think that my present
</p>
<p>action is interested. The open and unusual
</p>
<p>manner in which I do not cease to declare myself
</p>
<p>guilty, in the sense in which you accuse me, must
</p>
<p>show you that I do not act from weakness. Death
</p>
<p>or exile would be to me the pathway to immor-
</p>
<p>tality, and I shall tread it with a heroic and
</p>
<p>religious zeal, but my proscription, like that of all
</p>
<p>other democrats, will not advance you one whit, or
</p>
<p>ensure the salvation of the republic.
</p>
<p>" I have seen, on reflection, that in the last resort
</p>
<p>you have not always been the enemies of this
</p>
<p>republic. You were once evidently republicans in
</p>
<p>good faith. Why will you not be so again ? Why

<p>cumstances have thrown you ? The patriots and
</p>
<p>THE CATASTROPHE 179
</p>
<p>the mass of the people have a lacerated heart.
</p>
<p>Would you tear it still more ? What would be
</p>
<p>the final result? Do not these patriots rather
</p>
<p>deserve that, instead of aggravating their wounds,
</p>
<p>you should think at last of curing them ? You
</p>
<p>have, when it pleases you, the initiative of well-
</p>
<p>being, since in you resides the whole force of public

<p>administration. Citizen Directors, govern popu-

</p>
<p>ing thus for them, I am sure that they will not
</p>
<p>interrupt my voice. I am sure of not being
</p>
<p>repudiated by them. I see but one policy that it
</p>
<p>is wise for you to take. Declare that there has
</p>
<p>never been any serious conspiracy. Five men, in
</p>
<p>thus showing themselves great and generous, can
</p>
<p>to-day save the country. I allege still further
</p>
<p>that the patriots will cover you with their bodies,
</p>
<p>and that you will have no more need of entire
</p>
<p>armies to defend you. The patriots do not hate
</p>
<p>you ; they only hate your unpopular acts. I will
</p>
<p>then give you, on my own account, a guarantee
</p>
<p>as extended as is my habitual frankness. You
</p>
<p>know the measure of influence that I have with
</p>
<p>this class of men  I refer to the patriots. Well, I

<p>will employ it to convince them that if you are at

</p>
<p>This letter, not perhaps very wise or altogether
</p>
<p>dignified under the circumstances, had, as might be
</p>
<p>expected, no effect on its recipients. Four of the
</p>
<p>Directors at least were uncompromising in their
</p>
<p>determination mercilessly to stamp out the move-
</p>
<p>ment, while the fifth, Barras, whatever may have
</p>
<p>been his private ideas or inclinations, found him-
</p>
<p>self ah'eady an object of secret suspicion to his
</p>
<p>colleagues, and had to fall in ^vith their projects,
</p>
<p>with all the alacrity he could assume, if he was to
</p>
<p>avoid placing himself in a false, and even a danger-
</p>
<p>ous, position. The president of the Directory,
</p>
<p>Carnot, that "organising genius," carried everything
</p>
<p>before him at this juncture by his energy and
</p>
<p>determination. His struggle with the only other
</p>
<p>man of real ability at the head of affairs, Barras, was
</p>
<p>deferred to a later day. Barras won on the 18th
</p>
<p>Fructidor, though only himself to be overthrown by
</p>
<p>Bonaparte on the 18th Brumaire.

<p>But, to return to our prisoners, they were all at

</p>
<p>portant of the prisoners, amongst them Babeuf and
</p>
<p>THE CATASTROPHE 181
</p>
<p>Buonarroti, to the prison of the Temple. One im-
</p>
<p>portant prisoner, however, was allowed to remain
</p>
<p>at the Abbaye. We refer to Jean Baptiste Drouet,
</p>
<p>whose name has been several times mentioned in
</p>
<p>connection -\Wth the proceedings of the Secret
</p>
<p>Directory. Drouet had a special significance as
</p>
<p>being a Mountainist member of the Convention,
</p>
<p>and one of the few who succeeded in getting into
</p>
<p>the new Council of Five Hundred. It was he who
</p>
<p>was the postmaster at the small town of Ste.
</p>
<p>Menehould, and who procured the arrest of Louis
</p>
<p>XVI. at the time of his flight to Varennes in June
</p>
<p>1791. He was a man whose past gave him influ-
</p>
<p>ence with all the existing parties, and his adhesion
</p>
<p>to the movement of Babeuf obtained for him
</p>
<p>additional importance.
</p>
<p>Now this man Drouet, in his capacity of political
</p>
<p>prisoner, was rather a white elephant to the execu-
</p>
<p>tive Directory. In the first place, his being among
</p>
<p>the accused prevented the great trial coming under
</p>
<p>the jurisdiction of the High Court of Justice of
</p>
<p>Paris, as in the ordinary course it would have
</p>
<p>done. For by article 265 of the Constitution of
</p>
<p>the year III. it was pro\aded that members of
</p>
<p>the Legislature were not to be tried before the
</p>
<p>ordinary tribunals, but that a special high court
</p>
<p>was to be established to deal "vvith their cases.
</p>
<p>Hence it was that the government decided that

</p>
<p>the whole process should take place before a
</p>
<p>182 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>special highl court, whose seat was fixed at the
</p>
<p>town of Vendome, in the department of the
</p>
<p>Loir et Cher. But, for reasons of his own, Barras
</p>
<p>was particularly unwilling that Drouet should
</p>
<p>be brought to trial at all. Hence, shortly be-
</p>
<p>fore the time of the trial came on, on the 1st
</p>
<p>Fructidor, ann. IV. (17th August 1796), Drouet
</p>
<p>was allowed, it has now been proved, with the
</p>
<p>connivance of Barras, to effect his escape from the
</p>
<p>Abbaye. Drouet succeeded in getting away from
</p>
<p>France into Switzerland. From thence he went to
</p>
<p>TenerifFe, where he took a leading part in the
</p>
<p>successful resistance to the attack of Nelson in the
</p>
<p>following year. He became a sub-prefect under
</p>
<p>the Empire, and died at Macon in 182-1.
</p>
<p>On the 9th Prairial, ann. IV. (26th May 1796),
</p>
<p>the old members of the Society of the Pantheon,
</p>
<p>together with some of the Mountainists. attempted
</p>
<p>to raise the populace to deliver the prisoners. The
</p>
<p>attempt, however, was a failure. During the earlier
</p>
<p>period of his detention in the Temple, Babeuf s en-
</p>
<p>thusiasm for the cause seemed at times to render
</p>
<p>him indifferent to every other consideration, even to
</p>
<p>the welfare of his wife and family. As the weeks
</p>
<p>went on, however, he softened, and the following
</p>
<p>letter to his well-to-do friend Felix Le PeUetier is
</p>
<p>of interest, as expressing at once his political testa-
</p>
<p>ment and his regard for the domestic affections,

<p>and, lastly, as a specimen of his literary style at its
</p>
<p>THE CATASTROPHE 183
</p>
<p>best. It is dated "The Tower of the Temple,
</p>
<p>26th Messidor, anno I\'. (10th of August 1796),"
</p>
<p>and is as follows : 
</p>
<p>" Greetings, dear Felix ! Don't alarm yourself
</p>
<p>on seeing these lines traced by my hand. I know
</p>
<p>that all that bears the imprint of relations with
</p>
<p>me gives the right to disquietude. I am the being
</p>
<p>that all fly from; that all regard as dangerous,
</p>
<p>and of a deadly approach. Howev^er, my conscience
</p>
<p>tells me that I am pure ; and my true friends, that
</p>
<p>is, certain just men, know also that I have nothing
</p>
<p>wherewith to reproach myself. If even they shun
</p>
<p>me, it is not from any real aversion which I inspire
</p>
<p>in them, but it is the effect of the factitious terror
</p>
<p>imposed upon them by malice, lest by chance they
</p>
<p>should be reputed criminals, and treated as such.
</p>
<p>In this position the consideration that I owe to
</p>
<p>good men prescribes to me the interdiction of all
</p>
<p>intercourse with them, in order to avoid giving
</p>
<p>them the smallest alarm. But urgent considera-
</p>
<p>tions, such as present themselves naturally to the
</p>
<p>thoughts of a man on the brink of the tomb, have
</p>
<p>decided me to make one more advance towards one
</p>
<p>of my fellow-citizens whom I especially esteem. I
</p>
<p>do this the more willingly inasmuch as I am sure
</p>
<p>to run no other risk than that, perhaps, of somewhat
</p>
<p>disquieting him. It is a sacrifice that friendship
</p>
<p>can make. I shall hghten it in reassuring you,

<p>184 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>nothing to fear. I was certain, in getting this
</p>
<p>epistle conveyed to you, the last that I shall
</p>
<p>address to you, that it would overcome without
</p>
<p>peril all the obstacles that might come between
</p>
<p>you and me.
</p>
<p>" Behold us, then, without doubt, more at ease
</p>
<p>with one another  you to read me, I to conclude
</p>
<p>what I have to tell you ! 1 have built my text,
</p>
<p>in speaking to you, on friendship. I have called
</p>
<p>you friend ! I have believed, and I believe, that
</p>
<p>1 may do so. It is by this title that I address
</p>
<p>you in confidence  respecting do you know what ?
</p>
<p> my testament, and last recommendation.
</p>
<p>" I make the following assumptions subordinate
</p>
<p>to its execution  that proscription will not always
</p>
<p>pursue you ; that the tyrants, sated with my blood
</p>
<p>and that of some of my unhappy companions, ^vill
</p>
<p>be contented, and their own policy will not counsel
</p>
<p>them, perhaps, to do what they at first appeared to
</p>
<p>propose doing, namely, to make a hecatomb of
</p>
<p>all republicans. On the other hand, it might
</p>
<p>still happen, after my martyrdom, that fortune
</p>
<p>will tire of striking our country, and then that
</p>
<p>her true children may breathe in peace. If it is
</p>
<p>otherwise, I lose all hope as to what shall survive
</p>
<p>me. Then all will perish in the vast cataclysm
</p>
<p>that crime against virtue and justice will engender.

<p>repose of nothingness, the last inevitable end of

<p>IVIachiavellian politicians who multiply my suffer-

</p>
<p>generous efforts to break down slavery and to

<p>cause the horrible misery of the country to cease.
</p>
<p>They have not blushed, finally, to seek to cast

<p>upon me alone this capital offence, in ornamenting
</p>
<p>it with all the accessories by which they thought
</p>
<p>to be able effectively to give it the colour of

<p>to compromise no one by name, only involving

<p>in the charge brought against me the coalition of
</p>
<p>all the democrats of the entire Republic, because
</p>
<p>I thought it at first useful to strike at despotism

<p>an insult to any democrat not to present him as

<p>to regard as the non plus ultra of cleverness? They

<p>have gained nothing beyond dishonour to them-

<p>selves, to discredit revolutionaries with the people,
</p>
<p>who necessarily always disperse when they see
</p>
<p>themselves abandoned by their leaders. They
</p>
<p>have also succeeded in encouraging the enemy by
</p>
<p>the spectacle of such weakness. They have

<p>succeeded, finally, in precipitating the more rapidly

<p>their own proteges into the abyss. You have not

</p>
<p>The letter then proceeds to exculpate Le
</p>
<p>Pelletier still further from any share in the base
</p>
<p>conduct of others, and to recall his loyal expressions
</p>
<p>of devotion to the cause, and to those who were
</p>
<p>now in prison as its martyrs. Babeuf continues,
</p>
<p>that to a man who has spoken and who thinks
</p>
<p>thus, he has no hesitation in addressing the appeal
</p>
<p>for himself and his family, which forms the con-
</p>
<p>cluding portion of the letter.
</p>
<p>" I have no need," writes Babeuf, " to assure you,
</p>
<p>that, in my complete devotion to the people, I have
</p>
<p>not thought of my personal affairs, neither have I
</p>
<p>ever forecast as to what might happen in the case
</p>
<p>of the failure that has now befallen me. I leave
</p>
<p>two children and a wife, and I leave them without

<p>her movements, and of her resolution when you
</p>
<p>188 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>cause her to read this letter. You will permit me
</p>
<p>to give a little more in detail what I wish to be
</p>
<p>done for the unfortunates that I am abandoning.
</p>
<p>INIy two sons : the elder, as far as I can judge from
</p>
<p>the little that has been done for his education, will
</p>
<p>not have a great aptitude for the sciences. This
</p>
<p>would seem also to argue that he will not have the
</p>
<p>ambition to play any important role in the political
</p>
<p>arena. Hence he may pass his life quietly, and
</p>
<p>thus avoid the painful lot and misfortunes of his
</p>
<p>father. This boy has at least an excellent judg-
</p>
<p>ment and an independent spirit, the result of all the
</p>
<p>ideas in which he has been nourished. I have
</p>
<p>sounded him as to what he would like to be.
</p>
<p>Workman, he replied, but workman of the most
</p>
<p>independent class possible, and he cited that of
</p>
<p>the printer. He was not so far wrong, perhaps,
</p>
<p>and I desire nothing more than that he should
</p>
<p>follow his tastes. I can say nothing as regards
</p>
<p>his younger brother, who is too young as yet to
</p>
<p>decide anything as to his capacities ; but if I have
</p>
<p>ground to hope that you will do as much for him
</p>
<p>as for the elder, I am content. Gracchus Babeuf
</p>
<p>has never been ambitious for himself or for his
</p>
<p>children. He has only been anxious to procure
</p>
<p>some good for the people. He would be too
</p>
<p>fortunate if he knew that his children were by
</p>
<p>way of becoming some day good and peaceable

<p>artisans, among the classes of which society has
</p>
<p>THE CATASTROPHE 189
</p>
<p>always need, and which consequently can never be
</p>
<p>wanting to her.
</p>
<p>" As regards my wife, in the face of the fact that
</p>
<p>she only has the domestic virtues and the simple
</p>
<p>qualities belonging to the mother of a family, all
</p>
<p>that will be necessary to preserve her from a
</p>
<p>pitiable want will be very little. It will suffice to
</p>
<p>advance her some small sum to place her in a
</p>
<p>position to undertake one of those minor occupa-
</p>
<p>tions such as furnish all that is necessary to keep
</p>
<p>a small family.
</p>
<p>" And now, my good friend, I will ask of you one
</p>
<p>more favour. The nature of my trial and its slow
</p>
<p>progi'ess tell me that I have still a certain number
</p>
<p>of days to live before that day when I shall go to
</p>
<p>sleep myself on the bed of honour, to expiate the
</p>
<p>acts which render me supremely culpable in the
</p>
<p>eyes of the enemies of humanity. 1 can wish, for
</p>
<p>my consolation, that my mfe and my children
</p>
<p>might accompany me, so to say, to the foot of the
</p>
<p>altar where I shall be immolated ; that will do me
</p>
<p>much more good than a confessor. Place them, I
</p>
<p>pray of you, in a position to make the journey, so
</p>
<p>that I shall not be deprived of this last satisfaction.
</p>
<p>" ^ly body will return to earth. There will
</p>
<p>remain no more of me than a sufficient quantity
</p>
<p>of projects, notes, and sketches of democratic and
</p>
<p>revolutionary writings, all tending to the last aim,

<p>to the complete philanthropic system for which I
</p>
<p>190 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>die. My wife will be able to collect them all ; and
</p>
<p>one day, when the persecution shall have slackened,
</p>
<p>when perchance good men shall breathe again,
</p>
<p>with freedom enough to be able to cast a few
</p>
<p>flowers on our tomb, when people will have
</p>
<p>come to think again on the means for procuring to
</p>
<p>the human race the happiness we have proposed
</p>
<p>for it, you may look into those fragments, and
</p>
<p>present to all the disciples of Equality, to those of
</p>
<p>our friends who preserve our principles in their
</p>
<p>hearts  you may present to them, I say, for the
</p>
<p>benefit of my memory, a selection of these divers
</p>
<p>fragments, containing all that the corrupt of to-day
</p>
<p>call my dreams. I have finished. 1 embrace you
</p>
<p>and bid you adieu. G. Babeuf."
</p>
<p>It was not until the 10th Fructidor, ann. IV.
</p>
<p>(27th August 1796), that Babeuf and his associates
</p>
<p>were transferred to Vendome during the night, in
</p>
<p>cages made on purpose, as Buonarroti alleges, to
</p>
<p>make of them an exhibition as of wild beasts.
</p>
<p>Gendarmes and a strong detachment of cavalry
</p>
<p>escorted the vehicles conveying the accused, which
</p>
<p>were followed by others containing their wives and
</p>
<p>children, among whom were Madame Babeuf and
</p>
<p>her son Emile. Three days later the cortege arrived
</p>
<p>at Vendome, the accused being placed in the cells
</p>
<p>under the court buildings, to which all access from

</p>
<p>outside was severely prohibited. According to
</p>
<p>THE CATASTROPHE 191
</p>
<p>Buonarroti, the evenings were relieved by the sing-
</p>
<p>ing of revolutionary songs on the part of the
</p>
<p>prisoners, in which the inhabitants of the town who
</p>
<p>happened to be in the neighbourhood of the prison
</p>
<p>frequently joined.
</p>
<p>The high court which was to try them was
</p>
<p>composed of the president, Gandon, and of five
</p>
<p>other judges, Coffinhal, Pajou, Moreau, Audier,
</p>
<p>and ^Nlassillon. There were, in addition, two supple-
</p>
<p>mentary judges, Lalonde and Ladeve. The public
</p>
<p>prosecutors were Viellart and Bailly. The jury
</p>
<p>was composed of sixteen members, four adjuncts,
</p>
<p>and four supplementary^ members. But the
</p>
<p>prisoners had still some months to wait in durance.
</p>
<p>At last, after the usual formalities, the trial began
</p>
<p>on the 2nd Ventose, ann. V. (the 20th February '97),
</p>
<p>and was destined to drag on its course to the
</p>
<p>7th Prairial, ann. V. (27th May 1797).
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the remains of the party of which
</p>
<p>Babeuf was the leader were not inactive in Paris.
</p>
<p>Babeuf and his associates had been scarcely a
</p>
<p>month in the dungeons beneath the courthouse of
</p>
<p>Vendome before a final attempt, which had been
</p>
<p>some weeks in preparation, was made to win over
</p>
<p>to the revolutionary cause the mihtary in the
</p>
<p>camp at Crenelle, near Paris. On the 7th of
</p>
<p>September some hundreds of followers of the
</p>
<p>Babeuf movement rose in abortive insurrection.

</p>
<p>Their plan was first of all to seize the palace of the
</p>
<p>192 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>Luxembourg, the official residence of the Directory,
</p>
<p>and where the five directors were sitting, and next,
</p>
<p>after securing the persons of the directors, to pro-
</p>
<p>ceed to the camp of Crenelle, there to induce a
</p>
<p>movement among the military, and to bring back
</p>
<p>those favourable to their scheme as an armed force
</p>
<p>to Paris.
</p>
<p>But the attack on the Luxembourg failed.
</p>
<p>The authorities, warned in time of the move-
</p>
<p>ment that was on foot, reinforced the guards
</p>
<p>round the governmental palace, and the attacking
</p>
<p>force was driven off, although not effectively dis-
</p>
<p>persed. The insurgents rallied but did not a
</p>
<p>second time attempt to penetrate into the Luxem-
</p>
<p>bourg. Abandoning this part of their plan, they
</p>
<p>proceeded in a body to Grenelle, Here they had
</p>
<p>every hope of success, judging from the reports
</p>
<p>they had received, but here also they were likewise
</p>
<p>doomed to a failure that proved the final disaster
</p>
<p>to their party. On summoning the camp, in which
</p>
<p>General Latour was in command, to join them,
</p>
<p>they were greeted with an unexpected resistance,
</p>
<p>under the immediate orders of Colonel Mario.
</p>
<p>Instead of, as they had hoped and expected, tokens
</p>
<p>of fraternisation, they were met by a series of
</p>
<p>volleys fired into their number. In a few minutes
</p>
<p>they were in panic-stricken flight, leaving more
</p>
<p>than a hundred dead and wounded on the field.

<p>This attempt on the camp at Grenelle was the
</p>
<p>THE CATASTROPHE 193
</p>
<p>last dying flicker of the spirit of popular insurrection
</p>
<p>in Paris and France for a long time to come, and
</p>
<p>may be fittingly regarded as the closing episode of
</p>
<p>the French Revolution, considered as one distinct
</p>
<p>and connected historical event.
</p>
<p>The Government could have wished for noth-
</p>
<p>ing better than this abortive demonstration. It
</p>
<p>afforded them an excuse for hunting down all
</p>
<p>suspected of revolutionary sympathies in Paris
</p>
<p>and the departments surrounding the capital.
</p>
<p>Those arrested soon approached the number of
</p>
<p>300. These prisoners were not brought before
</p>
<p>the ordinary tribunals, but were tried by a specially
</p>
<p>appointed military commission, in other words,
</p>
<p>a court martial. As might be expected, numerous
</p>
<p>sentences of death were pronounced, and as many
</p>
<p>as thirty persons were executed by military platoons
</p>
<p>on the plain of Crenelle. In addition to this, a
</p>
<p>large number were sentenced to penal servitude
</p>
<p>and to deportation. The only prominent person
</p>
<p>who had the courage to defend the vanquished
</p>
<p>democrats was the noble-minded Pache, the late
</p>
<p>Mayor of Paris, during the period of the first
</p>
<p>Commune, who issued, from his residence in the
</p>
<p>country, whither he had retired, a pamphlet zeal-
</p>
<p>ously championing the unfortunate victims, and
</p>
<p>denouncing in scathing terms the conduct of the
</p>
<p>governing classes of the day.

<p>CHAPTER VIII
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL OF BABEUF AND HIS COLLEAGUES
</p>
<p>On the opening of the proceedings on the 2nd of
</p>
<p>Ventose (anno V.), forty -seven prisoners were
</p>
<p>brought up, eighteen of the accused being en con-
</p>
<p>tumace. Among the latter were Drouet, Lindet,
</p>
<p>Reys, Le Pelletier, and Rossignol. A large force of
</p>
<p>troops surrounded the building where the trial was
</p>
<p>held, while each of the accused was guarded by
</p>
<p>two gendarmes. The place reserved in the large
</p>
<p>audience hall for the public was always filled with
</p>
<p>admirers of the incriminated movement, who vigor-
</p>
<p>ously applauded every utterance of the prisoners.
</p>
<p>Many of the accused, it should be remarked, though
</p>
<p>belonging to the revolutionary movement, had had
</p>
<p>nothing whatever to do with the actual conspiracy,
</p>
<p>but were arrested out of spite. Amongst the
</p>
<p>prisoners present might have been seen the old
</p>
<p>Jacobin and landlord of Robespierre, Duplay and
</p>
<p>his son.

<p>THE TRIAL OF BABEUF 195
</p>
<p>of the movement were those of Babeuf, Germain,
</p>
<p>Antonelle, and Buonarroti.
</p>
<p>Darthe remained silent, refusing to recognise
</p>
<p>the jurisdiction of the court. He made one
</p>
<p>speech only at the beginning of the proceedings,
</p>
<p>which is given by Buonarroti. "As for me," it
</p>
<p>is related that he said, " if providence has fixed
</p>
<p>for this epoch the end of my career, I shall end
</p>
<p>it with glory, without fear and without regret.
</p>
<p>What have I indeed to regret ? When liberty
</p>
<p>succumbs ; when the edifice of the Republic is
</p>
<p>crumbling piece by piece; when its name has
</p>
<p>become odious ; when its friends, worshippers of
</p>
<p>Equality, are pursued, are hunted, scattered,
</p>
<p>given over to the rage of assassins or to the
</p>
<p>agonies of hunger ; when the people are the
</p>
<p>prey of famine and of want, deprived of all their
</p>
<p>rights, abused, despised, crushed beneath a yoke of
</p>
<p>iron ; when this sublime Revolution, the hope and
</p>
<p>consolation of oppressed nations, has ceased to be
</p>
<p>more than a phantom ; when the defenders of the
</p>
<p>country are everywhere covered with outrages,
</p>
<p>deprived of all, maltreated, bent beneath the most
</p>
<p>odious despotism ; when, as the price of their
</p>
<p>sacrifices, of their blood poured out in the common
</p>
<p>defence, they are treated as criminals, assassins, and
</p>
<p>brigands, their laurels changed to cypress ; when
</p>
<p>royalism is everywhere bold, protected, honoured,

<p>my soul. Thrown when young into the Revolution,
</p>
<p>I have supported all its fatigues, have borne all its
</p>
<p>dangers, without ever falling back. I have had no
</p>
<p>other pleasure than the hope of seeing the day that
</p>
<p>should found the durable reign of equality and of
</p>
<p>liberty. Solely occupied with the sublimity of this
</p>
<p>philanthropic enterprise, I have entirely abnegated
</p>
<p>myself. Personal interests, the affairs of my family,
</p>
<p>everything has been forgotten and neglected. My
</p>
<p>heart has never beat save for my fellow-men and
</p>
<p>for the triumph of justice."
</p>
<p>The above harangue, with its characteristic
</p>
<p>eighteenth-century ring, were the only words
</p>
<p>spoken before the tribunal by Darthe. The prose-
</p>
<p>cution from the very first gave evidence of the
</p>
<p>bitterness of its animus against the accused, as well
</p>
<p>as against everything savouring of democracy.
</p>
<p>The government prosecutor in his speech conjured
</p>
<p>up visions of a faction of monstrous beings hitherto
</p>
<p>unknown in the history of mankind, children of
</p>
<p>anarchy and crime, to which the prisoners belonged.
</p>
<p>To this hideous and diabolical faction he traced all
</p>
<p>the democratic episodes of the Revolution ; its
</p>
<p>whole course, from the taking of the Bastille to the
</p>
<p>fall of Robespierre, was involved in one common
</p>
<p>anathema. The government prosecutors even went
</p>
<p>so far on the side of reaction as to condone the

<p>royalist insurrection of the 13th Vendemiaire of

<p>the preceding year. Great efforts were made by
</p>
<p>198 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>the judges as well as by the public prosecutors to
</p>
<p>prevent the accused from defending or even ex-
</p>
<p>pounding the doctrines contained in the pieces

</p>
<p>in this matter led to frequent " scenes " throughout
</p>
<p>the trial.
</p>
<p>The Wle attempts of these government agents
</p>
<p>to blacken and vilify the characters of the accused
</p>
<p> imputing dishonesty to men who had notori-

<p>ously risked their lives for the country, and who,
</p>
<p>unlike their enemies and accusers, the members
</p>
<p>of the then governing classes, had left the public
</p>
<p>offices occupied by them, before the triumph of the
</p>
<p>reaction, in a state of poverty, amounting in some
</p>
<p>cases to positive indigence  led to many an out-

<p>burst of indignation from prisoners and public alike.
</p>
<p>For these men the fundamental principles of the
</p>
<p>Revolution, as enshrined in the " Rights of JNlan "
</p>
<p>and the Constitution of 1793, were a religion, the
</p>
<p>sacred trust for which they were proud to suffer all
</p>
<p>things, and if need were to sacrifice their lives.
</p>
<p>The spirit animating them was shown by the en-
</p>
<p>thusiasm with which they chanted their republican
</p>
<p>hymns in court each day at the close of the trial.
</p>
<p>The chief witness against the accused was the

<p>traitor Grisel. Together with him were other

<p>by so strong a moral repulsion to the archtraitor
</p>

</p>
<p>that they refused to sit beside him. The defence
</p>
<p>attempted to get rid of Grisel by invoking the law
</p>
<p>which made the evidence of a denunciator legally
</p>
<p>inadmissible in cases where he could personally
</p>
<p>profit by his denunciation, whether by direct pay-
</p>
<p>ment or otherwise. The public prosecutors, in
</p>
<p>order to get over this difficulty, had to maintain
</p>
<p>that Grisel was not a denunciator "within the
</p>
<p>meaning of the Act," because, forsooth, his first
</p>
<p>declaration was made, not to the police, but to one
</p>
<p>of the Directors (Carnot), a fact which constituted
</p>
<p>his statements a simple revelation, and not a
</p>
<p>denunciation in the true sense of the word,
</p>
<p>thereby excluding him from the category of the
</p>
<p>law as invoked by the prisoners. Naturally this
</p>
<p>quibble excited universal derision, but the court,
</p>
<p>as might have been expected, admitted it all the
</p>
<p>same. Grisel must be received as a witness at
</p>
<p>all costs.
</p>
<p>There were in all five hundred pieces de convic-

</p>
<p>where Babeuf was lodging at the time of his arrest.
</p>
<p>The most of them were at once recognised by their
</p>
<p>authors, though, in a few cases, experts were called
</p>
<p>in to fix the identity of those responsible for them.
</p>
<p>Among them were the reports of the agents work-
</p>
<p>ing in the interests of the Secret Directory in
</p>
<p>the several arrondissements. The latter docu-

<p>the greatest effect in the seventh arrondissement.

<p>Among other places, at the corner of the Rue

<p>THE TRIAL OF BABEUF 201
</p>
<p>A great fuss was made as to a document con-
</p>
<p>taining some words which Babeuf had covered
</p>
<p>vnth. a great blot of ink. The discussion on this
</p>
<p>subject bid fair to become a free fight between
</p>
<p>the prisoners, their counsel, and the court. The
</p>
<p>seance had to be abruptly terminated, the prisoners,
</p>
<p>as was their custom, intoning a couplet of the
</p>
<p>Marseillaise : Tj^emblez, tyrans, et vous perfides !
</p>
<p>On one occasion, when the public prosecutors
</p>
<p>complained to the judges of the prolongation of
</p>
<p>the trial, alleging that a number of voices were
</p>
<p>being raised against the dilatoriness of the proceed-
</p>
<p>ings in the high court, Babeuf sprang to his feet,
</p>
<p>exclaiming, " Whose are those voices ? " and, turning
</p>
<p>to the pubhc, *' You will divine, friends of the
</p>
<p>people ! " He proceeded to denounce the privi-
</p>
<p>leged classes, many of whom could not wait the
</p>
<p>ordinary course of law in their bloodthirsty im-
</p>
<p>patience to immolate their victims. In this cry one
</p>
<p>would hearken in vain for the voices of the four-and-
</p>
<p>twenty millions of oppressed people of whose cause
</p>
<p>they, the prisoners, were the defenders. " Virtue
</p>
<p>does not die," he concluded. " Tyrants may wallow
</p>
<p>in atrocious persecution ; they do but destroy the
</p>
<p>body ; the soul of good men does but change its
</p>
<p>covering ; on the dissolution of one, it animates

<p>desire : I neglect useless details in my delence ;

</p>
<p>Grisel related his experiences during two
</p>
<p>of the court. Buonarroti sa>-s that what he stated
</p>
<p>was in the main true NVhat revolted everybody
</p>
<p>was his c\-nical avowal of treachery and bfeadi ci
</p>
<p>confidence. Turning towards the bencfa where the :
</p>
<p>accused were sitting, he said, ** I only see agents here;
</p>
<p>not one of them was the real chief of the co o apu mej ; i
</p>
<p>behind the curtain were men who caused these to
</p>
<p>work and act." This remark was doubUes aimed
</p>
<p>by Grisel, who was in the service of CamoC agUDst
</p>
<p>the latter's fellow-director and enemy, BarrasL
</p>
<p>The statement, however, called forth from Germain

<p>says, " rests entirely in the avowal that they made
</p>
<p>204 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>of their democratic doctrines ; in the solemn
</p>
<p>homage which they rendered to the Constitution
</p>
<p>of 1793, and in their perseverance in justifying
</p>
<p>hypothetically the object of the conspiracy." The
</p>
<p>conspiracy, of course, centred in the formation of
</p>
<p>a Secret Directory, the object of which was
</p>
<p>insurrection. It was this "usurpation of the
</p>
<p>sovereignty," as it was termed, that formed the
</p>
<p>central indictment of the prosecution. " We have
</p>
<p>not here," said Babeuf, " a trial of indi\'iduals ; we
</p>
<p>have a trial of the Republic itself. It must, in
</p>
<p>spite of all, be treated with the dignity, the majesty,
</p>
<p>and the devotion that so powerful an interest
</p>
<p>commands. All republicans," said Babeuf, "are
</p>
<p>implicated in this affair; consequently it belongs
</p>
<p>to the Republic, to the Revolution, to history."
</p>
<p>He proceeded to thank the genius of liberty for
</p>
<p>having furnished him with a tribune, even though

<p>it were the bench of the accused, from which to
</p>
<p>declare the truth.

<p>illegal violence with which those in power had

<p>deprived the people of the rights belonging to

<p>them by virtue of it, brought down upon him

<p>and its manifestoes as in no way contrary to

</p>
<p>law or to revolutionary precedent. Babeuf sub-
</p>
<p>sequently returned to the charge, proclaiming
</p>
<p>at the top of his voice "the awakening of the
</p>
<p>true people, the reign of happiness, the reign of
</p>
<p>equality and hberty, abundance for all, equality
</p>
<p>and liberty for all, the happiness of all  such
</p>
<p>are the aims of these pretended conspirators,
</p>
<p>who have been painted in such horrifying colours
</p>
<p>before the eyes of all France ! " He justified
</p>
<p>the revolutionary principle of the sacred right of
</p>
<p>insurrection, repudiating with energy the whittling
</p>
<p>away of this principle by the prosecution with
</p>
<p>the specious sophism that insurrection is only
</p>
<p>legitimate when it is made by the universality of
</p>
<p>the citizens, such being ob\'iously equivalent to
</p>
<p>the assertion that it was never justified. On some
</p>
<p>of his colleagues, notably Ricord, seeking to throw
</p>
<p>the responsibility for certain of the most aggi^essive
</p>
<p>manifestoes on the ageiits provocateurs of the
</p>
<p>government, Grisel's name being mentioned in
</p>
<p>connection with the " Insurrectionary Act," Babeuf
</p>
<p>indignantly spurned this cowardly method of
</p>
<p>defence by shamefaced denial and falsehood.
</p>
<p>Turning to Ricord, " No ! " he exclaimed, " Grisel
</p>
<p>did not do it. It is not a piece which need
</p>
<p>make its author blush, and Grisel is too great a
</p>
<p>scoundrel to have drawn up any such document."

<p>his career since the da^vn of the Revolution,
</p>
<p>206 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>defended the Constitution of 1793, and denounced
</p>
<p>the usurping government based on that of the
</p>
<p>year HI.
</p>
<p>As the trial went on, day by day, the interest
</p>
<p>of the pubUc in the proceedings and the sym-
</p>
<p>pathy shown with the prisoners grew rather than
</p>
<p>abated. It had its echo outside the walls of
</p>
<p>the court-house in an abortive attempt to induce
</p>
<p>a mutiny in their favour on the part of the soldiers
</p>
<p>placed on guard at the tribunal. A plot was formed
</p>
<p>for the escape at least of those most seriously
</p>
<p>compromised. Suitable tools were smuggled into
</p>
<p>the prison, by the aid of which a large breach in
</p>
<p>one of the walls was made. The moment for
</p>
<p>escape had actually arrived when, through the
</p>
<p>careless conduct of one of the accused, suspicion
</p>
<p>was aroused with the authorities, the plan dis-
</p>
<p>covered, and all hope of flight was at an end.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the public prosecutors demanded the
</p>
<p>guillotine for sundry of the prisoners, while their
</p>
<p>task in demonstrating at once the reality and
</p>
<p>gravity of the conspiracy was an easy one, given
</p>
<p>the mass of incriminatory material. The accused,
</p>
<p>on their side, for the most part took the line of
</p>
<p>defence that, even if there had been a conspiracy,
</p>
<p>it was justified by the fact that the Constitution,
</p>
<p>against which it was admittedly directed, was
</p>
<p>itself illegal, being contrary to the will of the

<p>people, by which it had never been ratified, and
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL OF BABEUF 207
</p>
<p>subversive of that will, inasmuch as it abrogated
</p>
<p>the Constitution of 1793, which, on its side, had
</p>
<p>been solemnly accepted by the popular voice. In
</p>
<p>a word, they argued that the existing government,
</p>
<p>and the constitution on which it was based, was
</p>
<p>null and void, having no claim on the allegiance
</p>
<p>of French citizens. The attempt to overthrow it,
</p>
<p>therefore, so far from being a crime, was rather the
</p>
<p>assertion of legality against usurpation.
</p>
<p>The public prosecutors refused to enter into this
</p>
<p>question of right and justification, confining their
</p>
<p>speeches to a demonstration of the fiicts which
</p>
<p>could not effectively be denied. They could show
</p>
<p>without difficulty that there had been a conspiracy,
</p>
<p>which aimed at subverting the government and
</p>
<p>at overthrowing the existing economic bases of
</p>
<p>society. Beyond this, it only remained for them
</p>

</p>
<p>208 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>as to its justification should be ruled out. This
</p>
<p>view was, of course, adopted by the court, but
</p>
<p>its adoption did not prevent the prisoners from
</p>
<p>developing their own principles and their full
</p>
<p>consequences to the jury, including a drastic in-
</p>
<p>dictment of the authors of the Constitution of the
</p>
<p>year III., which placed full power in the hands of
</p>
<p>an oligarchy, with the dictatorship of a co-opted
</p>
<p>committee at its head. These expressions of
</p>
<p>opinion the judges found it impossible to suppress.
</p>
<p>In championing the cause of the popular Consti-
</p>
<p>tution of 1793, the accused were careful to
</p>
<p>expose the trick by which the governing classes,
</p>
<p>the authors of the Constitution of the year III.,
</p>
<p>which supplanted it, had endeavoured to get public
</p>
<p>opinion on their side in attempting to tar it and
</p>
<p>all revolutionary principles with the responsibility
</p>
<p>for the excesses of the government of the Terror.
</p>
<p>" You are always recalling," said they (through
</p>
<p>the mouth of Babeuf), " the measures of 1793, but

<p>you pass over in silence all that preceded the

</p>
<p>the unheard-of cruelties by which the barbarous

</p>
<p>and all of those who retained some attachment to

<p>the ever-growdng dangers of the country, we shall

<p>by the counter-revolutionaries at Montauban, at

<p>the shades of the millions of republicans mowed down

<p>the return of which they ceaselessly conspired, even

<p>210 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>One and all of the prisoners gloried in their
</p>
<p>aiFection for the Constitution of the year 1793,
</p>
<p>as guaranteeing to the people the inalienable
</p>
<p>right of making its own laws, and for its having
</p>
<p>been accepted with all but unanimity by the
</p>
<p>French people. So conclusive was the logic of the
</p>
<p>defence that it did not fail at certain times to
</p>
<p>stagger the public prosecutors themselves, who
</p>
<p>were often at a loss for a reply. Were they being
</p>
<p>indicted, demanded the accused, for having called
</p>
<p>the attention of the people to the violation of their
</p>
<p>rights that had been practised upon them ? In
</p>
<p>that they were only making use of that freedom of
</p>
<p>speech and of the press that even the Constitution
</p>
<p>of the year III. itself guaranteed to all Frenchmen.
</p>
<p>While contending that their accusers had altogether
</p>
<p>failed to prove the existence of the " dangerous and
</p>
<p>criminal conspiracy " alleged by them, they never-
</p>
<p>theless maintained, that had they really conspired
</p>
<p>to re-establish the Constitution of 1793, they would
</p>
<p>only have been doing their duty as citizens in
</p>
<p>fulfilling the oath to be faithful to liberty, to the
</p>
<p>sovereignty of the people, and to the RepubUc.
</p>
<p>Speaking of the communism with which he and his
</p>
<p>companions were charged, Babeuf boldly reaffirmed
</p>
<p>the proposition he had often enough preached in
</p>
<p>the Pantheon Club, as well as in the Tribun du
</p>
<p>Peuple, that private property is the cause of all the

</p>
<p>evils on the face of the earth. " By the preaching
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL OF BABEUF 211
</p>
<p>of this doctrine," said he, " long ago proclaimed by
</p>
<p>the wise, I have sought to rally to the Republic
</p>
<p>the people of Paris, tired of revolutions, discouraged
</p>
<p>by misfortunes, and almost converted to royalism
</p>
<p>by the intrigues of the enemies of liberty."
</p>
<p>Babeuf's defence occupied four days. It was
</p>
<p>very diffuse in character, constituting an elaborate
</p>
<p>vindication of his whole theory and policy. It is
</p>
<p>scarcely necessary to say that the scope and inten-
</p>
<p>tion of the present work precludes its being given
</p>
<p>in extefiso, or indeed in anything fuller than a com-
</p>
<p>paratively summary analysis. The complete text,
</p>
<p>as revised by Babeuf, and left by him for publication,
</p>
<p>extends over more than three hundred closely-
</p>
<p>printed pages. These, however, comprise most of
</p>
<p>the material  proclamations, decrees, manifestoes,
</p>
<p>etc.  already given or described.
</p>
<p>The many incidents referred to generally in the
</p>
<p>foregoing, respecting the conduct of the proceedings,
</p>
<p>reached their climax during the twenty-first sitting,
</p>
<p>when the President, losing his temper, stopped
</p>
<p>Babeuf abruptly with the words :  " Up till now it
</p>
<p>is you who have been conducting these discussions.
</p>
<p>I declare to you that from this day it will be me."
</p>
<p>He expressed his indignation at hearing Babeuf
</p>
<p>deny the conspiracy, recalling the letter to the
</p>
<p>Directory of the 21st of Floreal (see page 174), after
</p>
<p>his arrest, in which he offered to treat with them on

</p>
<p>terms of equality, claiming that he was the centre
</p>
<p>212 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>of the last conspiracy of Democrats. To this
</p>
<p>Babeuf repHed, he only wanted to scare the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment in order to save the Democrats, and convey
</p>
<p>the impression of a great conspiracy. Babeuf vi^as
</p>
<p>continuing the discussion when the President again
</p>
<p>interrupted, and, with menacing gestures, called out,
</p>
<p>" We have had enough of your speeches, considering
</p>
<p>that you now say you only took a secondary part in
</p>
<p>the movement. Who were, then, the real instigators
</p>
<p>of the conspiracy ? " The answer of Babeuf to this
</p>
<p>question was, that the moment had not yet arrived
</p>
<p>for him to give that explanation. This question of
</p>
<p>the President was not warranted by the facts,
</p>
<p>because throughout the proceedings Babeuf never
</p>
<p>shrank from the responsibility of the part that he
</p>
<p>had taken, and in no way endeavoured to foist the
</p>
<p>blame upon his colleagues ; on the contrary, he did
</p>
<p>everything to emphasise his personal responsibility
</p>
<p>for all that had taken place.
</p>
<p>These are examples only of the various episodes
</p>
<p>that arose in the course of the proceedings, and were
</p>
<p>prior to the actual opening by Babeuf of his
</p>
<p>defence-in-chief The indignation of the audience
</p>
<p>was apparent, and someone shouted, " You have no
</p>
<p>right to put obstacles in the way of an accused in
</p>
<p>conducting his case ; and in particular," indicating
</p>
<p>Babeuf, " in any case his head is here to pay ! " Con-
</p>
<p>siderable disturbance was created by the noise and

</p>
<p>angry exclamations from the accused, who shouted
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL OF BABEUF 213
</p>
<p>invectives against the judges, and demanded how it
</p>
<p>was possible for them fairly to defend themselves ?
</p>
<p>Although indisposed in health, owing to his long
</p>
<p>confinement, at the twenty-fourth sittingof the Court
</p>
<p>Babeuf demanded to be allowed to make an appli-
</p>
<p>cation to the Court. The President demurred, with
</p>
<p>harshness, saying :  " Are you going to read us all
</p>
<p>these volumes ? How long do you mean to take ? "
</p>
<p>Babeuf replied, "The time necessary to state my
</p>
<p>defence ! " Then he asked for an adjournment for
</p>
<p>eight days to enable him to prepare his statement,
</p>
<p>urging that it was impossible to defend himself
</p>
<p>without preparation. After considerable discussion,
</p>
<p>the Court settled down ; and order being restored,
</p>
<p>it was decided to grant a delay of four days. On the
</p>
<p>reassembling of the Court after a lapse of six days,
</p>
<p>Babeuf began his speech. He read from a written
</p>
<p>statement of two hundred folio sheets, and went
</p>
<p>through the documents forming the grounds of the
</p>
<p>charge against himself and his colleagues, which
</p>
<p>were, as already stated, very voluminous, making
</p>
<p>three or four large bundles. He reminded the Court
</p>
<p>of the extraordinary length of the Act of Accusation,
</p>
<p>and said that its length and the nature of the speeches
</p>
<p>for the prosecution had given to those proceedings
</p>
<p>such prominence and grave importance, and those
</p>
<p>documents and the speeches gave so many varied
</p>
<p>reports of the movement, that it was necessary for

</p>
<p>him to combat them in detail. He lost no oppor-
</p>
<p>214 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>tunity of making propaganda for the principles
</p>
<p>underlying the acts brought against the accused,
</p>
<p>warmly denouncing the corruption and treachery
</p>
<p>towards the people of those in power. At the same
</p>
<p>time he did not spare the weak places in the
</p>
<p>armour of the prosecution. For example, the strong
</p>
<p>point made by the latter was the attempt of the
</p>
<p>" Equals," as represented by their Secret Directory,
</p>
<p>to corrupt the Legion of Police. He showed that
</p>
<p>the latter was already disaffected, quite apart from
</p>
<p>the agitation of his own party. As a matter of fact,
</p>
<p>the body called the " Legion of Police " was largely
</p>
<p>composed of members of the old "revolutionary
</p>
<p>army " of the First Paris Commune in the Hebert-
</p>
<p>ist days, and was rife with Hebertist views.
</p>
<p>Babeuf claimed indulgence for his prolixity and
</p>
<p>apparent disorder, and said that an accused before
</p>
<p>his judges must not be assumed guilty before he
</p>
<p>had been fully heard, that there was a danger of
</p>
<p>an apparent show of confusion, which might be mis-
</p>
<p>taken for consciousness of guilt. He quoted the
</p>
<p>words of Mably, who, writing upon criminal legis-
</p>
<p>lation, said, " The first sentiment of an honest man
</p>
<p>when he is accused of crime is a certain feeling of
</p>
<p>shame which embaiTasses him, and he is momen-
</p>
<p>tarily at a loss to defend himself. He dreads the
</p>
<p>uncertainty of human judgment. It would be
</p>
<p>monstrous to take this embarrassment for a con-

</p>
<p>fession of guilt." He said it would be fairer if an
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL OF BABEUF 215
</p>
<p>innocent man, when accused, were enabled to calmly
</p>
<p>justify himself, and present the truth to his tribunal
</p>
<p>without the embarrassing presence and interruption
</p>
<p>of his accusers.
</p>
<p>" I have dared to conceive and preach the
</p>
<p>following doctrine : 
</p>
<p>' The natural right of men and their destiny to
</p>
<p>be happy and free. Society is instituted to
</p>
<p>guarantee the more certainly to each member the
</p>
<p>natural right of his destiny. When these natural
</p>
<p>rights are not the lot of all, the social pact is
</p>
<p>broken. In order to prevent the social pact being
</p>
<p>broken, it is necessary to have a guarantee. This
</p>
<p>guarantee can only reside in the right of each
</p>
<p>citizen to watch over its infractions, to denounce
</p>
<p>them to all its members, to be the first to resist
</p>
<p>oppression, and to exhort other members to resist.
</p>
<p>Hence the in\'iolable, indefinite, and individual
</p>
<p>right to think, to reflect, and to communicate one's
</p>
<p>thoughts and reflections ; to observe continually if
</p>
<p>the conditions of the social pact are maintained in
</p>
<p>their integrity, in their entire conformity to natural
</p>
<p>rights ; to rise up against their invasion by oppres-
</p>
<p>sion and against tyranny so soon as recognised ; to
</p>
<p>propose means for repressing these attempts at usur-
</p>
<p>pation by those who govern, and to reconquer all
</p>
<p>rights lost. Such is the doctrine solely on account
</p>
<p>of which I am persecuted. All the rest of what

</p>
<p>Once more we see in the foregoing how the
</p>
<p>inevitable social compact theory incarnated in
</p>
<p>Rousseau dominated the revolutionary mind. In
</p>
<p>this respect Babeuf was no more than the echo
</p>
<p>of contemporary thought. He continues : " Ah,
</p>
<p>indeed, we are not the first men who have been
</p>
<p>persecuted by the powers on earth for holding the
</p>
<p>like principles. Socrates there was, whose end was
</p>
<p>the poisoned cup ; Jesus, the Galilean, who preached
</p>
<p>equality of men, the hatred of riches, the love of
</p>
<p>justice and truth ; Lycurgus, who exiled himself to
</p>
<p>avoid being sacrificed by those whom he had bene-
</p>
<p>fited ; Agis, the only just one among the kings,
</p>
<p>who was killed because he was an exception to the
</p>
<p>rule ; the Gracchi at Rome, who were massacred ;
</p>
<p>Manlius, who was thrown from the capitol ; Cato,
</p>
<p>who stabbed himself ; Barneveldt and Sydney, who
</p>
<p>went to the scaffold ; Margarot, who vegetated in
</p>
<p>the deserts ; Kosciusko, who languished in the
</p>
<p>dungeons of St Petersburg ; James Welldon, who
</p>
<p>had his heart torn out ; and, nearer home, in our
</p>
<p>revolution, the martyr Michel Le Pelletier, who
</p>
<p>perished by the steel of the assassin." Babeuf says
</p>
<p>further, that it cannot be too often repeated that
</p>
<p>the proceedings of the accusers against himself and
</p>
<p>his colleagues were political movements in the
</p>
<p>French Revolution, and that upon the ultimate
</p>

<p>Republic. The royalists, always on the alert, were
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL OF BABEUF 217
</p>
<p>vigilantly waiting at all the doors for the results of
</p>
<p>the trial. " My name," says he, in effect, " has
</p>
<p>acquired a fatal celebrity, as it has been given to
</p>
<p>the sect which saw through them all, and had
</p>
<p>already devoted them to the poignards. The
</p>
<p>epithets, etc., of Robespierrists, Terrorists, Jacobins,
</p>
<p>and Anarchists have disappeared ; their place is
</p>
<p>taken by that of Babouvists. In the democracy
</p>
<p>of Rome T should have been convoked before an
</p>
<p>assembly of the people in a public place, and the
</p>
<p>people themselves would have been my judges as
</p>
<p>to whether I had betrayed them ; but in a great
</p>
<p>State like France such a trial is impossible, and the
</p>
<p>people cannot constitute themselves a tribunal to
</p>
<p>judge those who are accused of conspiring against
</p>
<p>them or their accepted Government." Babeuf con-
</p>
<p>tended that he and his colleagues could not be
</p>
<p>brought within the definition of conspirators as
</p>
<p>given by the prosecution in its opening speech,
</p>
<p>according to which " conspiracy " meant to over-
</p>
<p>throw the legitimately established Government, for
</p>
<p>they had been unable to show by any of the
</p>
<p>numerous writings and documents quoted and
</p>
<p>produced against him any elements of such a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. He claimed that his writings, manifestoes,
</p>
<p>decrees, and proclamations contained nothing more
</p>
<p>than the precepts put forward by such eminent
</p>
<p>writers as Mably, Rousseau, Diderot, Morelly, and

</p>
<p>masters of whom he and his colleagues were only the

<p>disciples ; that he claimed the liberty of the press
</p>
<p>to dilate on and review the doctrines and teachings
</p>
<p>of such great authorities. Men like Tallien and
</p>
<p>Armand de la Meuse had advocated the same
</p>
<p>principles in their writings and speeches, and still
</p>
<p>remained in the legislative assembly. Why were
</p>
<p>they not also brought before the High Court ? And
</p>
<p>he quoted passages from Tallien's paper, L'Ami
</p>
<p>des Sans-culottes, No. 71, and a long speech of the
</p>
<p>deputy Armand de la Meuse before the Convention,
</p>
<p>in which views were expressed such as were common
</p>
<p>at the time, as to reducing the income of the rich
</p>
<p>for alleviating the needs of the poor, the result
</p>
<p>being a tendency to the equalisation of income, or
</p>
<p>at least to the rendering impossible of anything

<p>approaching the extremes of luxurious wealth on

<p>the one hand and penurious indigence in the other

<p>such as was the usual form assumed by aspirations,

<p>towards economic equality during the French

</p>
<p>" gross immorality " on the part of the authorities,
</p>
<p>and complains of the conduct of the magistrate or
</p>
<p>police official who was responsible for that act, and
</p>
<p>to the petition of the people of Arras to the
</p>
<p>executive Directory asking for the punishment of
</p>
<p>that magistrate. It will be remembered that
</p>
<p>Arras was the town where, with Charles Germain
</p>
<p>and others, he was retained in prison for a long
</p>
<p>period without trial. He further goes on to relate
</p>
<p>to the jury the facts relative to the Bodson corre-
</p>
<p>spondence, applying for a fair consideration by them
</p>
<p>of the above-mentioned document. This corre-
</p>
<p>spondence with Bodson, Babeuf maintains, was
</p>
<p>absolutely confidential, and most unfairly brought
</p>
<p>forward against him by the prosecution. He says :
</p>
<p>" Is it not permitted to me to write ? Is it not
</p>
<p>permitted to me, the same as to others, to com-
</p>
<p>municate by letter with whom I wish? Since
</p>
<p>when have confidential communications in friend-
</p>
<p>ship been Hable to be delivered to a tribunal, and
</p>
<p>to be made the foundation of a prosecution ? "
</p>
<p>He emphasises these incidents, and claims that they
</p>
<p>show the undue severity and harshness meted out

<p>in his ideas, and urges that nothing contained in
</p>
<p>these documents could be evidence of conspiracy
</p>
<p>against him ; and if at times he had been violent in
</p>
<p>his expressions in the articles published in his paper
</p>
<p>Le Trihun, especially referring to l^o. 40, it was
</p>
<p>occasioned by the unjust acts of the authorities,
</p>
<p>which were an outrage on humanity, justice, and
</p>
<p>the constitution. He points out an important
</p>
<p>passage in the Act of Accusation which was to the
</p>
<p>following effect ; 
</p>
<p>" If these individuals associate together in meet-
</p>
<p>ings, communicating their ideas, their wishes, and
</p>
<p>their hopes ; if they arrange a plan of execution in
</p>
<p>which all promise to concur ; if each of them
</p>
<p>charges himself with and fulfils a certain role ; if
</p>
<p>the combined efforts of all are directed toward one
</p>
<p>common end ; if amongst them they establish an
</p>
<p>organisation, chiefs who give orders and instructions ;
</p>
<p>if they appoint their agents to carry out those
</p>
<p>orders conformably to those instructions, there
</p>
<p>then exists a conspiracy ; it is concerted action
</p>
<p>which gives it that character ; and this conspiracy
</p>
<p>is the most criminal of undertakings when its aim
</p>
<p>is the overthrow of the estabhshed government,
</p>
<p>and the handing over of the nation to the most
</p>
<p>horrible anarchy.
</p>
<p>" Such is precisely the result of the documents
</p>
<p>that we shall produce. You will see that there

<p>ate, with appointed and empowered agents who had
</p>
<p>accepted their positions ; instructions given by the
</p>
<p>chiefs, only too faithfully performed by these same
</p>
<p>agents ; an active correspondence between them ;
</p>
<p>a perfectly concerted plan established, all working
</p>
<p>in accord, that they might more surely arrive at
</p>
<p>the common end. And what was that end ? The
</p>
<p>overthrow of the constitution, the extinguishment
</p>
<p>of all legitimate authority, innumerable massacres,
</p>
<p>universal plunder, the absolute subversion of all
</p>
<p>social order."
</p>
<p>Babeuf reviews this charge, saying :  " I hope,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, to be able to prove to you
</p>
<p>that such was not the result of the documents
</p>
<p>produced. That there was not such an organisa-
</p>
<p>tion, directory, body of empowered agents, institu-
</p>
<p>tion, execution, intention, and aim, as pretended
</p>
<p>by the prosecution." He declares that he had
</p>
<p>shown during his examination that the organisation
</p>
<p>of which he was a member was not such an associa-
</p>
<p>tion, but a Club or Reunion of Democrats, who
</p>
<p>met together for the purpose of discussing the
</p>
<p>public misfortune and affairs of interest to the
</p>
<p>country, with the desire and intention of ameliorat-
</p>
<p>ing the condition of the people, and that with this

<p>view they propounded plans and philanthropic
</p>

</p>
<p>222 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>traiy even to its own law of the constitution of the
</p>
<p>year III. Amongst other things, he went on to say
</p>
<p>that such meetings of democrats were composed of
</p>
<p>malcontents, who had every kind of right on their
</p>
<p>side, and such malcontents were warm in their love
</p>
<p>of the people. They were not merely republican,
</p>
<p>but were partisans of principles superior to the
</p>
<p>system of simple republicanism ; in a word, demo-
</p>
<p>crats, or citizens who were not satisfied with a
</p>
<p>condition of semi-welfare for the people, but who
</p>
<p>wished for them perfect rights and independence,
</p>
<p>and would tolerate no restrictions of their liberty ;
</p>
<p>that these same malcontents, seeing that the
</p>
<p>people were far from enjoying the maximum of
</p>
<p>welfare, the plenitude of independence and liberty
</p>
<p>which they believed to have been the aim of the
</p>
<p>revolution, fostered a serious desire and hope to
</p>
<p>change the Government, which they deemed anti-
</p>
<p>popular and contrary to the general well-being ;
</p>
<p>that these citizens from the first had put together
</p>
<p>and preserved for the public benefit papers contain-
</p>
<p>ing their views and ideas, their projects and aims
</p>
<p>on behalf of the country ; that these papers had
</p>
<p>been "svi'ongfully and illegally seized at the time of
</p>
<p>his arrest ; that they did not belong to him person-
</p>
<p>ally but to all repubhcans, members of that political
</p>
<p>club.

<p>ing conspiracy, and to claim that the jury could
</p>
<p>not, on fair consideration, find that they contained
</p>
<p>anything of the sort.
</p>
<p>On the fourth day he concluded the reading of
</p>
<p>his long statement with the following peroration : 
</p>
<p>"If, notwithstanding, our death is resolved
</p>
<p>upon ; if the fatal chime has sounded for me ;
</p>
<p>if my last hour is fixed at this moment in the
</p>
<p>book of destiny, I have for long been prepared
</p>
<p>for this hour. An almost perpetual victim from
</p>
<p>the first year of the Revolution of my love for
</p>
<p>the people ; identified with dungeons ; familiarised
</p>
<p>with the idea of torture and of violent death,
</p>
<p>which are almost always the lot of revolution-
</p>
<p>aries, what could there be to astonish me in this
</p>
<p>event? For a year past have I not had the
</p>
<p>Tarpeian rock ever present to me ? It has nothing
</p>
<p>to affright me ! It is beautiful to have one's name
</p>
<p>inscribed on the column of victims for the love of
</p>
<p>the people. I am sure that mine will be there !
</p>
<p>Too happy art thou, Gracchus Babeuf, to perish for
</p>
<p>the sake of virtue ! What, indeed, all things con-
</p>
<p>sidered, is lacking to my consolation ? Can I ever
</p>
<p>expect to finish my career in a nobler moment of
</p>
<p>glory ? I shall have experienced before my death

<p>of men who have also sacrificed themselves for
</p>
<p>224 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>humanity. The power which persecuted them has
</p>
<p>almost always succeeded in stifling for them the
</p>
<p>voice of truth. Their contemporaries, deceived or
</p>
<p>terrified by tyranny, have only poured upon their
</p>
<p>wounds the burning caustics of atrocious calumny
</p>
<p>and bloody outrage ! The thirst of their agony
</p>
<p>has, for the most part, been assuaged by foul
</p>
<p>poisons ; who knows if, even at the sight of the
</p>
<p>injustices of the misguided crowd and its perverse
</p>
<p>seducers, they have not been far from the consoling
</p>
<p>foresight, that time, the avenger, would rehabilitate
</p>
<p>their revered names, would ensure for them the
</p>
<p>worship of every age and guarantee their rights to
</p>
<p>immortality ? At least they had to await posterity.
</p>
<p>As for us, we have been happier ! The power,
</p>
<p>strong enough to oppress so long, has not been
</p>
<p>strong enough to defame us. We have seen truth
</p>
<p>spring forth from every pen during our lifetime, to
</p>
<p>register those deeds which honour us, and which
</p>
<p>will redound to the eternal shame of our persecu-
</p>
<p>tors. Even our enemies, at least those who are
</p>
<p>most opposed to us in opinion, even their passionate
</p>
<p>annalists, all have rendered justice to our virtues.
</p>
<p>How much the more ought we not to be secure in
</p>
<p>the thought that impartial history will engrave our
</p>
<p>memory in honourable traits. I leave to it written
</p>
<p>monuments, of which each line will witness that I

</p>
<p>CHAPTER IX
</p>
<p>CONCLUSION OF TRIAL AND TRAGIC DEATH
</p>
<p>OF BABEUF
</p>
<p>The leader of the accused having terminated his
</p>
<p>lonsf discourse, observations were addressed to the
</p>
<p>Court by Buonarroti, Veillart, JNIassart, Bally er,
</p>
<p>Didier, and others. Laflantry, a counsel who ap-
</p>
<p>peared for some of the accused, pleaded eloquently
</p>
<p>on behalf of Buonarroti, and several of the defendants
</p>
<p>made vain attempts to obtain a hearing, but were
</p>
<p>cut short by the President, who refused to listen
</p>
<p>to them. This brought the duration of the trial
</p>
<p>to the sixty-sixth sitting of the High Court (3
</p>
<p>Prairial V.  23rd May 1797), when the President
</p>
<p>addressed the jury, stating that he was about to
</p>
<p>put to them three questions which would bring
</p>
<p>the accused into three categories. The text of
</p>
<p>the first question of each series was as follows : 
</p>
<p>" I. Did there exist in Germinal and Floreal
</p>
<p>of the year IV. a conspiracy to overthrow the
</p>
<p>government, and set the citizens up in arms, one
</p>
<p>against the other>? "

<p>227
</p>
<p>228 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>"II. Did there exist a conspiracy against the
</p>
<p>legitimate authority ? "
</p>
<p>"III. Did there exist a conspiracy to force the
</p>
<p>dissolution of the two Councils and of the executive
</p>
<p>Directory ? "
</p>
<p>In these were involved two other uniform
</p>
<p>questions : 
</p>
<p>"1. Who of the accused took part in such
</p>
<p>conspiracy ? "
</p>
<p>" 2. Did he do so with the intention of facilitat-
</p>
<p>ing the carrying into execution of its intentions ? "
</p>
<p>Reypalade, the president juryman, criticised
</p>
<p>the questions, and particularly remarked as to the
</p>
<p>law of 27 Germinal, that it had been voted and
</p>
<p>created expressly to meet the present case and
</p>
<p>the acts of accusation under consideration. Veillart,
</p>
<p>in a long speech, appealed to the jury to disregard
</p>
<p>that law. He submitted that when the jury were
</p>
<p>convinced that an accused came within only one
</p>
<p>of the chief questions, they ought to declare that
</p>
<p>the three must be taken together, and not each of
</p>
<p>them as capital. One mil gather from the above
</p>
<p>the bias of the Court.
</p>
<p>At the following sitting. Real, a prominent
</p>
<p>member of the bar, and one of the principal defend-
</p>
<p>ing counsel, argued with considerable eloquence
</p>
<p>against the classification of these questions. He
</p>
<p>submitted that if they were based on the law of

</p>
<p>27 Germinal, as Reypalade had suggested, that the
</p>
<p>CONCLUSION OF TRIAL 229
</p>
<p>words " mechamment et a dessein" which would
</p>
<p>coincide with the EngUsh terms maliciouslij, and
</p>
<p>with criminal intent, must be added to that of
</p>
<p>intentionelle, or intentionally.
</p>
<p>Veillart contested the prop6sition of Real, and
</p>
<p>insisted upon the conclusions of the day before,
</p>
<p>and the rejection of the suggested amendments.
</p>
<p>He was constantly interrupted by the dissenting
</p>
<p>murmurs of the accused. He was supported in
</p>
<p>his argument by his colleague Bailly. The dis-
</p>
<p>cussions which then followed are only of mediocre
</p>
<p>interest in comparison "vvith those of the opening
</p>
<p>days.
</p>
<p>The defence was exhausted, and the defendants
</p>
<p>awaited the verdict. As to the prosecution, it was
</p>
<p>resumed in a virulent harangue launched by the
</p>
<p>above-mentioned Bailly, one of the national prose-
</p>
<p>cutors. He said, in effect, that the defendants were
</p>
<p>accused of the most heinous of crimes against the
</p>
<p>very foundations of French society ; that had they
</p>
<p>succeeded in the objects of their conspiracy, they
</p>
<p>would have overthrown the Republic " on a moun-
</p>
<p>tain of corpses covered with blood and tears." The
</p>
<p>atrocity of their plans and the extraordinary wicked-
</p>
<p>ness of their designs made the ultimate success of
</p>
<p>such an abominable plot impossible. France was
</p>
<p>tired of having revolution upon revolution thrust
</p>
<p>upon her, and so on. He called also to mind the

</p>
<p>reign of Terror, most disastrous to the State, and
</p>
<p>230 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>the eighteen months of execrable horrors that they
</p>
<p>had passed through. He said, " Robespierre and
</p>
<p>his abominable commune have passed away, but
</p>
<p>all the factions did not go with them. There ex-
</p>
<p>isted those who would do away with all authority,
</p>
<p>who -v^ished to have no government, republican or
</p>
<p>otherwise. And among the journals that agitated
</p>
<p>such principles was notoriously that of Babeuf, the
</p>
<p>oft-quoted Trihun du Peuple, which, he alleged,
</p>
<p>advocated absolute disorganisation, and Babeuf, the
</p>
<p>professed leader of the faction of the pretended
</p>
<p>' Equals,' had a preponderance that had astonished
</p>
<p>all those who had followed the evidence given during
</p>
<p>the trial. This great luminary, Babeuf, who was
</p>
<p>their shining light and the very spirit of the move-
</p>
<p>ment, and who regarded himself, and was recognised
</p>
<p>by his colleagues, as the only person capable of
</p>
<p>directing such stupendous enterprises, this exceed-
</p>
<p>ingly hot politician and ardent reformer, now ap-
</p>
<p>peared ignominiously before the Court as a very cold
</p>
<p>and insignificant person, posing as a mere copyist, a
</p>
<p>servile follower of a small coterie of philanthropic
</p>
<p>fanatics who dreamt of ways to lead the people
</p>
<p>to pure democracy."
</p>
<p>In addition to the above series of questions put
</p>
<p>to the jury by the President of the High Court,
</p>
<p>others were added, relating to alleged provocations,
</p>
<p>WTitten and verbal, to the re-establishment of the

</p>
<p>mediation, and at the request of the foreman or
</p>
<p>president of the jury, as just mentioned. In view
</p>
<p>of the circumstances relating to the constitution of
</p>
<p>the Court, the violent speech above referred to by
</p>
<p>the prosecutor Bailly was utterly superfluous, and
</p>
<p>was simply playing to the gallery.
</p>
<p>The proceeding of the Court was, moreover,
</p>
<p>illegal, as was subsequently recognised by the
</p>
<p>criminal tribunal of the Seine, which pronounced
</p>
<p>these questions to have been admitted by the high
</p>
<p>court of Vendome in contravention of the law.
</p>
<p>Buonarroti states that even the public prosecutors
</p>

</p>
<p>Some of the jurors, of whom there were six-
</p>
<p>teen, supported the accused, urging legaUty being
</p>
<p>observed in the interrogatories administered to
</p>
<p>them. But it was in vain. The judges compos-
</p>
<p>ing the High Court insisted, as we have seen, on
</p>
<p>restricting the conspiracy-indictment to the for-
</p>
<p>mula  " Has the accused conspired or provoked,
</p>
<p>with the intention of conspiring or provoking ? " 
</p>
<p>thus intentionally excluding all reference to moral
</p>
<p>justification for the incriminated acts. Only three
</p>
<p>of the sixteen jurors were consistently favourable
</p>
<p>throughout to the accused. Notwithstanding this,
</p>
<p>most of the counts relating to the conspiracy
</p>
<p>were met with an acquittal. It was only on the
</p>
<p>question of provocation, written and verbal, to the
</p>
<p>re-establishment of the Constitution of 1793, that
</p>
<p>certain of the prisoners, to wit, Babeuf, Darthe,
</p>
<p>Buonarroti, Germain, Cazin, Moroy, Blondeau,
</p>
<p>Menessier, and Bouin were convicted. Even
</p>
<p>then, " extenuating circumstances " were found for
</p>
<p>all except Babeuf and Darthe. The Blondeau
</p>
<p>referred to had been arrested for the share he
</p>
<p>had taken in attempting to corrupt the guards in
</p>
<p>order to enable Babeuf to effect his escape. The
</p>
<p>Government seemed to have used this prosecution
</p>
<p>as a convenient means of disposing of persons sus-
</p>
<p>pected by their agents, or otherwise inconvenient

<p>to them. Thus among the accused was a young

<p>CONCLUSION OF TRIAL 233
</p>
<p>for twelve months, although absolutely a stranger
</p>
<p>to the Babouvists and their movement.
</p>
<p>From the dawn of the 7th of Prairial, year V., the
</p>
<p>beating of drums, the noise of artillery, and unusual
</p>
<p>movements of troops announced to the inhabitants
</p>
<p>of the little town of Vendome the tragic end of the
</p>
<p>judicial drama to which they had become so long
</p>
<p>accustomed. The day the prisoners appeared for
</p>
<p>the last time before the tribunal the building was
</p>
<p>filled by a sad and silent crowd. On the declaration
</p>
<p>of the jury above given, which the eye-witness
</p>
<p>Buonarroti tells us was pronounced ^\dth a voice
</p>
<p>betraying strong emotion by the foreman, the
</p>
<p>leading prosecutor rose to demand the penalty of
</p>
<p>death for the two principal prisoners, namely,
</p>
<p>Babeuf and Darthe, and transportation for the
</p>
<p>others. One of the counsel for the defence made
</p>
<p>a last desperate attempt to get the verdict quashed
</p>
<p>by invoking the article in the new Constitution of
</p>
<p>the year III., which declared that no law affecting
</p>
<p>the liberty of the press should be vahd for longer
</p>
<p>than one year from the date of its promulgation.
</p>
<p>Hence it was contended that the law of the 27th
</p>
<p>of Germinal of the year IV., upon which the pro-
</p>
<p>secution had based its indictment, being a law
</p>
<p>containing clauses contravening the liberty of the
</p>
<p>press, had ceased to have effect, owing to its having
</p>
<p>been in existence for more than a year. As might

</p>
<p>have been expected, the court refused to consider
</p>
<p>234 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>the point, and proceeded to pass sentence on the
</p>
<p>prisoners in accordance with the demands of the
</p>
<p>prosecution. Babeuf and Darthe were sentenced
</p>
<p>to death, and the remaining seven to deportation to
</p>
<p>the French possessions in tropical America.
</p>
<p>No sooner had sentence been pronounced than
</p>
<p>a violent tumult made itself heard. Babeuf and
</p>
<p>Darthe had stabbed themselves with daggers. A
</p>
<p>cry arose, " They are being assassinated ! " Buonar-
</p>
<p>roti sprang to his feet and appealed to the people.
</p>
<p>The public in the body of the court made a sudden
</p>
<p>movement, which was immediately suppressed by
</p>
<p>a hundred bayonets (the precincts of the tribunal
</p>
<p>were all occupied by military) suddenly appearing
</p>
<p>and being levelled at the crowd. But Babeuf and
</p>
<p>Darthe had relied on clumsy, self-made daggers of
</p>
<p>worthless metal, which broke before reaching the
</p>
<p>hearts at which they aimed. ^ The only result of
</p>
<p>their attempt w^as a night of agony in their cells.
</p>
<p>For the moment the excitement amongst the public
</p>
<p>had made itself apparent ; and while the soldiers
</p>
<p>were in the act of driving back those surrounding the
</p>
<p>prisoners, the gendarmes rushed forward, seized the
</p>
<p>latter, and dragged them away to their dungeons,
</p>
<p>threatening them the while with their sabres.
</p>
<p>The following day the two wounded men were

</p>
<p>p. 336), their hands were seized by the gendarmes guarding

</p>
<p>carried to the guillotine. All, even their most
</p>
<p>vehement political opponents, admit that both,
</p>
<p>especially Babeuf, mounted the scaffold with a
</p>
<p>splendid courage that never deserted them to the
</p>
<p>last. The two bodies were thrown by the execu-
</p>
<p>tioner and his assistants, according to Buonarroti,
</p>
<p>into the common sewer, but, according to other
</p>
<p>accounts, were buried superficially in a plot of
</p>
<p>land not far off. In any case they were exhumed
</p>
<p>shortly after by their admirers, and reverently
</p>
<p>interred in a field belonging to one of the
</p>
<p>neighbouring peasants. The inhabitants of the
</p>
<p>little town of Vendome seem to have deeply
</p>
<p>sympathised with these victims of counter-revolu-
</p>
<p>tion. Buonarroti assures us that a deep gloom
</p>
<p>overhung the town the day of the execution 
</p>
<p>a " general mourning " is his expression.
</p>
<p>During his last painful night, Babeuf manned him-
</p>
<p>self to what must have been the terrible ordeal of
</p>
<p>inditing the following touching letter to his wife
</p>
<p>and family:  "Good evening, my friends. I am
</p>
<p>about to be enveloped in eternal night. I have
</p>
<p>better expressed to the friend [viz. Le Pelletier], to

<p>Your love for me has brought you hither in spite

<p>Fifty-six of the accused were acquitted. Among
</p>
<p>these was Vadier, the late jNIountainist member of
</p>
<p>the Convention, and president of the Committee
</p>
<p>of General Security during the Terror. He was
</p>
<p>naturally an object of special hatred to the Reaction ;
</p>
<p>and although he was residing in Toulouse at the
</p>
<p>time of the Babeuf conspiracy in Paris, and had no
</p>
<p>connection whatever with the movement, the
</p>
<p>opportunity was too good to be let slip by his
</p>
<p>enemies, so the unfortunate old man was dragged
</p>
<p>from Toulouse to the capital, and thence to
</p>
<p>Vendome, to stand his trial before the special high
</p>
<p>court for a matter of which he knew nothing.
</p>
<p>But that was not all. So incensed were the
</p>
<p>authorities against him that he was not allowed to
</p>
<p>speak even in his own defence. Notwithstanding
</p>
<p>this, the evidence against him being practically nil,
</p>
<p>the jury acquitted him without hesitation. Nettled
</p>
<p>by this failure, and not to be baulked of their prey,

</p>
<p>interned, together with the acquitted Vadier, in
</p>
<p>the fortress on the island of Pelee, situated at the
</p>
<p>entrance to the harbour of Cherbourg. The whole
</p>
<p>of the way thither they were kept chained and
</p>
<p>confined in iron cages, exposed in many cases to
</p>
<p>the insults and threats of reactionary crowds, though
</p>
<p>towns were not wanting through which they passed
</p>
<p>where they were received with the most friendly
</p>
<p>greetings. At Saint Lo, for example, the mayor,
</p>
<p>at the head of the municipal council, received them
</p>
<p>with every cordiality as " our unfortunate brothers."

<p>advocate's point of view  this same Real became,
</p>
<p>under the Empire, Prefect of Pohce, then Councillor
</p>
<p>of State, and finally Count. Germain died in 1830,
</p>
<p>a prosperous agriculturalist, having long deserted
</p>
<p>the fields of politics. Drouet, the postmaster of St
</p>
<p>JNIenehould, and strenuous member of the JVIountain
</p>
<p>in the Convention, also took service under the
</p>
<p>the Napoleonic regime, when he became sub-prefect,
</p>
<p>after having fii'st been decorated with the Legion
</p>
<p>of Honour. The IMarquis d'Antonelle, the col-
</p>
<p>league of Drouet on the Mountain, and a fellow-
</p>
<p>participator with the other Montagnards in the
</p>
<p>conspiracy of the Equals, appears, after some years
</p>
<p>of obscurity, after the Restoration, as a strong
</p>
<p>partisan of the resuscitated Bourbons. Vadier died
</p>
<p>in honourable consistency in exile during the
</p>
<p>Restoration period. The time and place of the
</p>
<p>death of his colleague on the Committee of General
</p>
<p>Security, Amar, remain in some doubt. Felix

<p>Le Pellet ier, who succeeded in escaping imprison-

<p>joined the Spanish patriots in their struggle for
</p>
<p>242 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>independence. Happening to hear, while in
</p>
<p>Spain, that Grisel, the traitor, who had dehvered
</p>
<p>over his father to death and his father's friends
</p>
<p>to imprisonment and exile, was also there, he
</p>
<p>sought him out and challenged him to a duel.
</p>
<p>The duel was one to the death. Emile Babeuf
</p>
<p>fought with a reckless bravery and fury. Finally
</p>
<p>he struck Grisel a mortal blow, but not before
</p>
<p>he himself had received a dangerous wound in
</p>
<p>the chest. This, however, was nothing to him.
</p>
<p>He had executed vengeance on the traitor.
</p>
<p>He subsequently became a bookseller in Lyons,
</p>
<p>where, however, he failed. Returning to Paris,
</p>
<p>he started a journal called the Nain Jaune, of
</p>
<p>strong Jacobin tendencies. But this also came to
</p>
<p>an untimely end, being seized by the police and
</p>
<p>suppressed. He tried bookselling again in Paris,
</p>
<p>but this time also with disastrous financial results.
</p>
<p>He then seems to have joined the imperial cause,
</p>
<p>and to have associated his fortunes with those of
</p>
<p>Napoleon the First. After the fall of the empire
</p>
<p>he emigrated to America, where he died in the
</p>
<p>early twenties of the last century. His brother
</p>
<p>Caius was killed in battle during the first inva-
</p>
<p>sion of French territory in 1814, while his other
</p>
<p>brother Camille committed suicide from the

<p>column Vendome in the following year, 1815, at
</p>
<p>the sight of the Cossacks entering Paris.

</p>
<p>Louis Pierre Babeuf, who occupied various official
</p>
<p>posts, having been sub-prefect in 1848, inspector
</p>
<p>of insurances, etc. He died in Paris, 20th February
</p>
<p>1871, at the age of sixty- two. With the death of

<p>this solitary grandchild of Gracchus Babeuf the

<p>name itself became extinct.

</p>
<p>(vol. i. pp. 344-5) may be of interest :

<p>to history ; and the facts, however we may regard

<p>them, prove nothing against his heart. He may

<p>have erred in his actions, but his conscience was

<p>never compromised. I will go farther and venture

<p>the assurance that he always had pure and dis-

</p>
<p>so far as he believed it useful to his country, and
</p>
<p>that he perished, a victim of his opinions, with

<p>the same fervour that the saints walked to their

<p>martyrdom. I have only one trait to cite that
</p>
<p>cannot be made public, but which will decide your
</p>
<p>opinion. Long persecutions by private enemies
</p>
<p>caused my father to languish in prison till the

<p>of an accusation of forgery, and was given back

<p>to society. But his fortune having been reduced

<p>family we were obliged to sell part of our furniture,
</p>
<p>for at that time famine reigned in Paris. My
</p>
<p>father was then again thrown into prison. The
</p>
<p>13th of Vendemiaire liberated him again, and he
</p>
<p>continued his journal, entitled the Tribun du
</p>
<p>Peuple. The government then deputed a man to
</p>
<p>go and see him, whose merits would be sufficiently
</p>
<p>proved did I but mention his name, in order
</p>
<p>to persuade him, hke Freron, to exchange his
</p>
<p>character, his conscience, his pen, for the ministry
</p>
<p>of finance ! My father was revolted at the pro-
</p>
<p>posal and broke with the negotiation. No person
</p>
<p>has hitherto related the fact that at the time of
</p>
<p>the entry of the Prussians into the plains of
</p>
<p>Champagne, my father, sent as commissioner of
</p>
<p>the department of the Somme to Peronne to see

<p>to the fortification of the place, defeated a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy there, which aimed at nothing less than
</p>
<p>delivering the place over to the enemy. He had

<p>the guilty arrested, and saved the town from being

<p>surprised the following night by an advanced
</p>
<p>guard of the Prussian army. Finally, no one has
</p>
<p>told how Paris, notwithstanding neglect and the

<p>months to the unremitting energies of the general

<p>TRAGIC DEATH OF BABEUF 245
</p>
<p>We have no means of testing the truth of
</p>
<p>the statements contained in the foregoing notice,
</p>
<p>with the exception of that respecting his work
</p>
<p>at the victuaUing commission in Paris, the con-
</p>
<p>scientious thoroughness of which is otherwise
</p>
<p>confirmed. More especially, as regards the alleged
</p>
<p>attempt on the part of the government to corrupt
</p>
<p>Babeuf by means of its mysterious emissary, we
</p>
<p>are left utterly in the dark, even by Emile himself,
</p>
<p>as to the nature of the position alleged to have
</p>
<p>been offered his father in the ministry of finance.
</p>
<p>But the notice, so far as ifcmile is concerned,
</p>
<p>certainly tends to confirm, what we gather from
</p>
<p>other indications in his career, namely, that with
</p>
<p>all his political worthlessness and general insta-
</p>
<p>bility of character, Emile Babeuf always retained
</p>
<p>an affectionate regard for the memory of his
</p>
<p>father. In view of this fact, we would willingly
</p>
<p>believe that his turning his back on the principles
</p>
<p>in which he had been brought up, and which he
</p>
<p>himself so ardently championed earlier in his life,
</p>
<p>in order to cringe before the "Corsican adventurer,"

<p>was due to this weakness of character, acted on by

<p>intrinsic moral baseness.
</p>
<p>CONCLUSION
</p>
<p>The movement of Babeuf for resuscitating the
</p>
<p>Revolutionary Government on an economic basis
</p>
<p>of a Socialist character was a failure, and, like all
</p>
<p>failures, like all movements that are suppressed
</p>
<p>with real success, or that, to speak in expressive
</p>
<p>slang, " peter out," leaving but slight direct traces
</p>
<p>behind them, has tended with the lapse of years
</p>
<p>to pass into historical oblivion. Comparatively
</p>
<p>few men of average education in the present day
</p>
<p>have ever heard of Babeuf. For the great world,
</p>
<p>as above said, he left nothing behind him, scarcely
</p>
<p>even a memory, except for the few interested in
</p>
<p>the byways and cul-de-sacs of history, and who
</p>
<p>honour single-minded devotion to the popular
</p>
<p>cause, even when it has been without result.
</p>
<p>Of the absolute sincerity, earnestness, and courage
</p>
<p>of the protagonist of the Equals there can be no
</p>
<p>sort of doubt with anyone who has studied the
</p>
<p>history of Babeuf and his ill-starred movement.
</p>
<p>Of his grasp of the situation, and of his intellectual

<p>CONCLUSION 247
</p>
<p>revolutionary aims, as much cannot be said. With
</p>
<p>all our admiration of Babeuf s energy and heroism
</p>
<p>as a revolutionary figure, it is impossible to avoid
</p>
<p>the conclusion that he was intellectually unstable.
</p>
<p>The correspondence with Dubois de Fosseux and
</p>
<p>others in his early days already indicated that. We
</p>
<p>fail to find, moreover, much trace (though w^e do
</p>
<p>some) of real originahty in the doctrines, into the
</p>
<p>attempted realisation of w^hich Babeuf threw such
</p>
<p>unsurpassed energy and self-devotion. They are
</p>
<p>mainly discoverable in other writers of eighteenth-
</p>
<p>century France, notably in INIorelly, in JNIably,
</p>
<p>and even in Rousseau. Babeuf himself admitted
</p>
<p>this, protesting that his trial was an attack on
</p>
<p>--^he hberty of the press, and that he was being
</p>
<p>prosecuted for professing doctrines that had had
</p>
<p>^^the support of Rousseau, of JNIably, and  true
</p>
<p>eighteenth- century touch  of Lycurgus !
</p>
<p>His instability of mind is crucially exhibited
</p>
<p>in the complete volte face he made as regards
</p>
<p>the question of Robespierre and Thermidor. In
</p>
<p>his Journal de la Uberte de la pi'esse, notably
</p>
<p>in the earlier numbers, we are confronted with
</p>
<p>measureless denunciations of Robespierre and the
</p>
<p>Terror, for which he was held responsible. In
</p>
<p>a short time, as we have seen in an earlier
</p>
<p>chapter of the present work, this uncompromis-
</p>
<p>ing attitude became modified in the sense of

</p>
<p>recognising two Robespierres,  Robespierre, the
</p>
<p>248 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>tyrant of the latter days of the Terror ; and Robes-
</p>
<p>pierre of earher days, the sincere apostle of Equality
</p>
<p>and the Revolution. But the matter did not rest
</p>
<p>here. Before the end of his political career, Babeuf
</p>
<p>had come to idolise the late dictator as something
</p>
<p>like a heaven-sent Messiah of the new era of revolu-
</p>
<p>tionary social construction. So far did he go in
</p>
<p>this, that in a copy of a letter addressed to Joseph
</p>
<p>Bodson (? Dobson), who appears to have been a
</p>
<p>Hebertist, found among the papers seized in
</p>
<p>Babeuf 's house, we find the declaration that the
</p>
<p>Babouvists were but the " second Gracchi " of the
</p>
<p>French Revolution, the first being Robespierre and
</p>
<p>his followers. Defending Robespierre against the
</p>
<p>attacks of his correspondent, " Let us give him
</p>
<p>back," says he, " his first legitimate glory, and all
</p>
<p>his disciples would arise anew and soon would
</p>
<p>triumph. Robespierrism overthrows anew all the
</p>
<p>factions ; Robespierrism does not resemble any of
</p>
<p>them, it is neither artificial nor limited. Hebertism
</p>
<p>exists only in Paris and among a small section of
</p>
<p>men, and can only sustain itself with difficulty.
</p>
<p>Robespierrism exists throughout the Republic in
</p>
<p>the whole class of the judicial and clear-sighted,
</p>
<p>and, of course, among all the people. The reason
</p>
<p>is simple : it is that Robespierrism is Democracy,
</p>
<p>and that the two words are identical. Hence,
</p>
<p>in resuscitating Robespierrism you are sure to

<p>resuscitate democracy."
</p>
<p>CONCLUSION 249
</p>
<p>One cannot but regret to find a man like Babeuf
</p>
<p>singing the praises of the author of the law of
</p>
<p>Prairial, and the judicial murderer of Anacharsis
</p>
<p>Clootz and of Chaumette, not to speak of his
</p>
<p>former friends and colleagues the Dantonists.
</p>
<p>Babeufs correspondent replied, warning him of
</p>
<p>the danger of his hero worship as likely to pre-
</p>
<p>judice his own movement, in view of the name
</p>
<p>Robespierre had left behind in connection with
</p>
<p>the Terror, while at the same time repudiating
</p>
<p>any blind partisanship with the party of Hebert.
</p>
<p>It is indeed by no means improbable that the
</p>
<p>injudicious utterances of Babeuf and his exaltation
</p>
<p>of Robespierre and the Terror did ahenate from his
</p>
<p>movement many of the rank and file of the Paris
</p>
<p>populace, who, although strong in their revolution-
</p>
<p>ary principles and zealous for the Constitution of
</p>
<p>'93, had no wish for a return to the pre-Thermi-
</p>
<p>dorean revolutionary government, with its Terror
</p>
<p>" the order of the day." Certainly, before and after
</p>
<p>the trial the Directorial government used the
</p>
<p>bogey of a return of the Terror to prejudice the
</p>
<p>movement of the Babouvists, and not without
</p>
<p>success among all classes of the population.
</p>
<p>It was, moreover, not true that the distinctive
</p>
<p>feature in the doctrine of Babeuf, its communistic
</p>
<p>character, was to be found in any of the writings
</p>
<p>and speeches of Robespierre and his partisans.

</p>
<p>Robespierre, St Just, and the rest were jealous
</p>
<p>250 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>upholders of the rights of private property. Their
</p>
<p>ideal was a Republic of the small middle-class,
</p>
<p>with the citizens possessed each of moderate means,
</p>
<p>sober, frugal, laborious, misery and want unknown,
</p>
<p>and an accumulation of wealth beyond a certain
</p>
<p>limit discouraged. This was the Rousseauite ideal
</p>
<p>of the period. Thus, though not possessed of a high
</p>
<p>originality, Babeuf certainly does himself injustice
</p>
<p>in professing to regard himself as a mere follower
</p>
<p>of Robespierre or any other of the earlier leaders.
</p>
<p>Probably the Hebertists approached, at least in
</p>
<p>spirit, as nearly the standpoint of Babeuf as any of
</p>
<p>his predecessors, but even they did not distinctly
</p>
<p>formulate any communistic proposals ; while Hebert
</p>
<p>himself, when on one occasion taunted by Robes-
</p>
<p>pierre, at the Jacobin Club, as to heresies on the
</p>
<p>subject of private property, the inviolability of
</p>
<p>which formed one of the points in the Declaration
</p>
<p>of the Rights of Man, expressly repudiated any
</p>
<p>such.
</p>
<p>The common Rousseauite atmosphere of thought
</p>
<p>and phraseology, with denunciations of a society
</p>
<p>admitting the extremes of excessive wealth and
</p>
<p>indigence, are to be found in all the men of that
</p>
<p>time, in Babeuf no less than in the rest. But,
</p>
<p>as already said, the remedy proposed by Babeuf
</p>
<p> the notion that only the abolition of the insti-
</p>
<p>tution of private property itself could cure the

<p>evils of society and prevent their return  was
</p>
<p>CONCLUSION 251
</p>
<p>certainly, as a practical proposal entering the
</p>
<p>iomain of current politics, peculiar to Babeuf.
</p>
<p>rhat the communistic idea itself was not original
</p>
<p>i\'ith Babeuf we have already shown in an earlier
</p>
<p>:hapter of the present work. He undoubtedly
</p>
<p>ierived it from the writings of Mably and ]\Iorelly.
</p>
<p>What was original in Babeuf was his attempt to
</p>
<p>place it as the immediate goal of the society of
</p>
<p>[lis time, to be directly realised by political methods.
</p>
<p>Babeuf was the first to conceive of Communism
</p>
<p>n any shape as a politically realisable ideal in the
</p>
<p>immediate or near future.
</p>
<p>Before Babeuf there were not wanting indications
</p>
<p>Df what might be termed a SociaUst tendency in
</p>
<p>individual revolutionists, notwithstanding the Con-
</p>
<p>vention, as a whole, on the first day of its assembly,
</p>
<p>had passed a resolution repudiating such tendencies,
</p>
<p>and decreeing the sacredness of private property.
</p>
<p>These tendencies were always sporadic in character,
</p>
<p>but are interesting for what they are worth.
</p>
<p>Curiously enough, it was the Girondin, Babaut St
</p>
<p>Etienne. ^^ith whom some of the strongest expres-
</p>
<p>sions of opinion in this sense are to be found.
</p>
<p>Thus, in the Chronique de Paris of January 19th,
</p>
<p>1793, he demands what he terms a supplement to
</p>
<p>the political revolution. " With the establishment
</p>
<p>of political equality,"' he observes, " the poor soon
</p>
<p>become sensible that the inequality of fortune

</p>
<p>vitiates equaUty ; and inasmuch as equality means
</p>
<p>252 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>independence, they wax bitter and indignant
</p>
<p>against those on whom they have to depend for
</p>
<p>their needs. They demand equaUty of fortune, but
</p>
<p>it is seldom that the rich are readily disposed to
</p>
<p>recognise the justice of this claim. Hence it must
</p>
<p>be obtained either by force or by law." After
</p>
<p>expressing the fear that force might tend to produce
</p>
<p>a new inequality, he proceeds to insist on the
</p>
<p>necessity of laws to effect the more equal division
</p>
<p>of property ; and not only so, but to maintain this
</p>
<p>greater equality of wealth when once effected, and
</p>
<p>to prevent the old inequality from reasserting itself.
</p>
<p>He goes on to talk, in the Rousseauite fashion of
</p>
<p>the time, of education in sobriety, modesty, and
</p>
<p>temperance by means of " moral institutions,"
</p>
<p>among which "institutions" he instances civic feasts,
</p>
<p>in which all Frenchmen should mingle together,
</p>
<p>irrespective of wealth or status. He advocates the
</p>
<p>enactment of laws limiting the amount of fortune
</p>
<p>a man may possess ; and ordaining that once this
</p>
<p>maximum is exceeded, society shall step in and
</p>
<p>take possession of all that is above it.
</p>
<p>The article in question, as might be expected, did
</p>
<p>not pass without adverse criticism, but Rabaut stuck
</p>
<p>to his guns, and a few days later replied, reaffirming
</p>
<p>his position. Society, he insists, in according its
</p>
<p>protection to the individual, has a right, in the last
</p>
<p>resort, of disposing of the goods of the individual.

</p>
<p>We need scarcely say that these views of Rabaut
</p>
<p>CONCLUSION 253
</p>
<p>St Etienne did not meet with any sympathy on
</p>
<p>the part of his colleagues of the Girondin party.
</p>
<p>While Rabaut St Etienne was promulgating the
</p>
<p>above views, an obscure journalist and popular orator
</p>
<p>aamed Varlet was also demanding, while admitting
</p>
<p>the sacredness of private property so long as not
</p>
<p>abused to the detriment of society, the confiscation
</p>
<p>by the State of all wealth acquired by monopoly,
</p>
<p>the rigging of markets, or dishonest speculation.
</p>
<p>Marat, as we all know, wrote in a similar sense
</p>
<p>regarding the facts of destitution, as absolving the
</p>
<p>destitute from all obligations to the society which
</p>
<p>admitted of it. His celebrated articles against the
</p>
<p>5'orestallers were an application of this line of
</p>
<p>:hought. In Marat's "s\Titings, in fact, there are
</p>
<p>iistinct indications of attempts at constructive
</p>
<p>egislative schemes implying far-reaching economic
</p>
<p>changes, but they remain merely hints. Hebert,
</p>
<p>igain, is strong on the right of the people to make
</p>
<p>:he " wealthy swine, who wax fat on the blood

<p>)f the poor, to disgorge " ; on the duty of the State

<p>;o confiscate, presumably for redistribution among

<p>;he indigent, of excessive wealth, which, as he
</p>
<p>naintains, cannot be acquired by honest means 
</p>
<p>vealth that only conduced to "needless luxury,
</p>
<p>vorthless display, riding in carriages," etc. But,
</p>
<p>vhile urging this, he none the less insists that the
</p>
<p>lotion of perfect equality of fortune is a chimera.

<p>[n Hebert no more than in the rest do we find
</p>
<p>254 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>communism in the literal sense of the word. The
</p>
<p>nationahsation, with a view to subsequent division,
</p>
<p>of the property of the clergy and emigrant nobles,
</p>
<p>had familiarised the people's minds generally with
</p>
<p>the idea of confiscation, and had correspondingly
</p>
<p>weakened the sentiment of the absoluteness of the
</p>
<p>rights of property as such.
</p>
<p>But with all this, we look in vain for any definite
</p>
<p>socialist or communist formulation of policy. The
</p>
<p>utmost we find in these revolutionary writers is the
</p>
<p>notion of the dividing up of the land (an agrarian
</p>
<p>law), and possibly of the products of consumption,
</p>
<p>and this most of them rejected as impracticable and
</p>
<p>Utopian. The prevailing state of industry and the
</p>
<p>economic conditions generally of the eighteenth
</p>
<p>century were not yet sufficiently advanced for the
</p>
<p>idea of the common ownership and co-operative
</p>
<p>working, in the common interest, of the means of
</p>
<p>production, to take definite shape.
</p>
<p>Hence the average mind of the eighteenth
</p>
<p>century could never get beyond the notion, as
</p>
<p>regards social reconstruction, of the repartition of
</p>
<p>the land and of the products of industry, as being
</p>
<p>the starting-point and the central principle of all
</p>
<p>such reconstruction.
</p>
<p>Babeuf himself did not see so much beyond
</p>
<p>his contemporaries in this matter, but, at all

<p>of social regeneration, and he had some idea of
</p>
<p>CONCLUSION 255
</p>
<p>the organisation of productive labour in common.
</p>
<p>As with the rest, he regarded the means towards
</p>
<p>the regeneration of human nature to consist, in
</p>
<p>the main, in a system of education. This system
</p>
<p>of educational direction was to continue through-
</p>
<p>out life. To quote the words of a manifesto
</p>
<p>by Babeuf s Insurrectionary Committee : "In the
</p>
<p>social order conceived by the committee, the country
</p>
<p>{i.e. the State) shall seize upon the new-born
</p>
<p>individual, never to leave him till his death. It
</p>
<p>shall watch over his first moments, shall assure
</p>
<p>the milk and the care of her who gave him birth,
</p>
<p>shall guard him from all that might injure his
</p>
<p>health and enervate his body, shall shield him from
</p>
<p>a false tenderness, and shall take him, by the hand
</p>
<p>of his mother, to the national home {maison
</p>
<p>nationale), where he shall acquire virtue and the
</p>
<p>illumination necessary to a true citizen."
</p>
<p>The ideal life of the individual appears to Babeuf,
</p>
<p>as to others of his contemporaries, to involve to a
</p>
<p>large extent severity and frugality of living  always
</p>
<p>the ideal of the peasant and the small independent
</p>
<p>craftsman. All is to be excluded that is not
</p>
<p>necessary to republican virtue ; " a rustic simpli-
</p>
<p>city " should take the place of elegance of furniture
</p>
<p>and of garments. In short, Babeuf s scheme bears
</p>
<p>upon it the unmistakable impress of his day and
</p>
<p>generation. As before said, what distinguishes

<p>Babeuf from his revolutionary predecessors is his
</p>
<p>256 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>placing communism, involving the definite abolition
</p>
<p>of the institution of private property, in the fore-
</p>
<p>front of his doctrine, in the more definite character
</p>
<p>of the latter, and in his bold idea of its prompt
</p>
<p>realisation by political means, through a committee
</p>
<p>of select persons placed in power by the people's
</p>
<p>will as the issue of a popular insurrection. In
</p>
<p>illustration of this may be quoted a passage from
</p>
<p>the manifesto of the Equals relative to the agrarian
</p>
<p>law, by which was understood partition of the
</p>
<p>soil among the peasant cultivators, and which was
</p>
<p>regarded as the extreme limit of economic revolu-
</p>
<p>tion. " We aim at," says the manifesto, " some-
</p>
<p>thing more subhme and more just than this  the
</p>
<p>common good or the community of goods ; no more
</p>
<p>individual property in land ; the land belongs to
</p>
<p>no one. We claim, we demand the common en-
</p>
<p>joyment of the fruits of the earth. These fruits
</p>
<p>belong to the whole world."
</p>
<p>The delusion that Robespierre was essentially
</p>
<p>a man of the people rather than of the middle
</p>
<p>bourgeoisie is sufficiently disposed of when we
</p>
<p>consider the measures of Robespierre's government
</p>
<p>in the second Committee of Public Safety, which
</p>
<p>lasted a year. It is true that, in view of the
</p>
<p>famine in Paris, it got passed the Decree of Sep-
</p>
<p>tember 1793, by which forty sous a day were
</p>
<p>granted to those attending the assemblies of the

<p>time being, to the rioting which had been going
</p>
<p>on for a long time almost continuously in Paris.
</p>
<p>But this was little more than a sop thro^vn to
</p>
<p>Cerberus. It was necessary to ward off the danger
</p>
<p>of another organised insurrection. On the other
</p>
<p>tiand, the Committee of Public Safety enacted severe
</p>
<p>regulations against workmen's combinations or
</p>
<p>assemblies with a view of raising wages or other-
</p>
<p>wise affecting trade interests. Those, indeed, who
</p>
<p>should complain, in the State factories now estab-
</p>
<p>lished for the manufacture of arms and munitions
</p>
<p>Df war, were threatened with ferocious penalties.
</p>
<p>All parties, including RobespieiTe and his friends,
</p>
<p>were eloquent in generalities respecting the desu-a-
</p>
<p>bility of a greater equality in incomes, condemning
</p>
<p>the existence side by side in the same society of
</p>
<p>abject indigence on the one side and overweening
</p>
<p>luxury on the other. But these, for the most
</p>
<p>part, were, as we have seen, mere repetitions of
</p>
<p>phrases common at the time. Those who, like
</p>
<p>the Hebertists, really desired to bring about
</p>
<p>greater economic equality, soon found themselves
</p>
<p>denounced by Robespierre and his friends as
</p>
<p>enrages, and ultimately sent to the guillotine for
</p>
<p>their pains.
</p>
<p>Towards the end of his political career, indeed,
</p>
<p>when Robespierre was desirous of conciliating the
</p>
<p>European powers, and still more the wealthier bour-
</p>
<p>geoisie at home, he became more emphatic than ever

<p>258 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>in denouncing all attacks on the principle of private
</p>
<p>property. Babeufs later obsession in favour of
</p>
<p>Robespierre, which went so far, as we have seen, as
</p>
<p>to proclaim him the protagonist of his own ideas,
</p>
<p>can only be explained by his hatred of the Thermi-
</p>
<p>doreans, who had supplanted Robespierre and the
</p>
<p>party he represented ; although certain Robes -
</p>
<p>pierrists with whom he came into close contact,
</p>
<p>especially the Lebon family in Arras, and probably,
</p>
<p>more than all, his colleague and fellow-martyr,
</p>
<p>Darthe, may well have had not inconsiderable
</p>
<p>influence on his change of view. The change
</p>
<p>between the Babeuf of the Journal de la liberie
</p>
<p>de la pi'esse and of the Systeme de depopulation,
</p>
<p>and the Babeuf of the later numbers of the Trihun
</p>
<p>du Peuple, is indeed remarkable. We may, indeed,
</p>
<p>take it as indicating a certain weakness in Babeufs
</p>
<p>character ; but if so, it was weakness that indicated
</p>
<p>an ingenuousness of disposition. The founder of
</p>
<p>the movement of the Equals, we can readily see,
</p>
<p>was possessed of an emotional temperament which
</p>
<p>carried him away, quite regardless of personal con-
</p>
<p>siderations. That he was prepared to shelter his
</p>
<p>own reputation for originality, without cause or
</p>
<p>justification, behind that of Robespierre, certainly
</p>
<p>indicates an absence of personal canity not a little
</p>
<p>unusual in the founders of popular movements.
</p>
<p>Babeufs mind was undoubtedly more original

<p>than Robespierre's, although the latter had what
</p>
<p>^sS^^?iSS^^^^S^^^g5g^^^^^^^^g^^i^g^^^
</p>
<p>CONCLUSION 259
</p>
<p>Babeuf lacked. Robespierre's ideas, as ideas, were
</p>
<p>but a pale reflex of the teachings of Rousseau.
</p>
<p>The success of Robespierre was due to his consistent
</p>
<p>pertinacity in urging them, and to his capacity for
</p>
<p>imbuing his colleagues and the Paris populace with
</p>
<p>the notion that he was the pure and disinterested
</p>
<p>personification of those ideas. Babeuf had little of
</p>
<p>Robespierre's dexterity ; but his boldness in apply-
</p>
<p>ing, not only the revolutionary side of Rousseau's
</p>
<p>teachings, but the Utopian theories of Mably and
</p>
<p>Morelly to the France of his day ; his idea of seizing
</p>
<p>the political power by a coup de viain, with a view
</p>
<p>to the immediate reorganisation of society on a
</p>
<p>communist basis, was in itself original in its
</p>
<p>inception. More than this we do not claim for
</p>
<p>Babeuf on the score of originality.
</p>
<p>In any case, Gracchus Babeuf and his move-
</p>
<p>ment cannot fail to be for the modern socialist of
</p>
<p>the deepest possible historical interest. Gracchus
</p>
<p>Babeuf was, in a sense, a pioneer and a hero of
</p>
<p>the modern international Socialist party.
</p>
<p>The movement of Babeuf had a kind of after-
</p>
<p>math in the nineteenth century in that of Auguste
</p>
<p>Blanqui. The Blanquist notion of the seizure
</p>
<p>of the political power by a coup de main on the
</p>
<p>part of a revolutionary minority, as the sole
</p>
<p>effective method preliminary to the reorganisation
</p>
<p>of society, is clearly traceable to the movement of

<p>the Equals, and the projected insurrection of the
</p>
<p>260 GRACCHUS BABEUF
</p>
<p>year V. Born on the 7th of February 1805, only
</p>
<p>eight years after the execution of Babeuf, son of
</p>
<p>a member of the Convention, Blanqui in his early
</p>
<p>youth came into direct contact with the old re-
</p>
<p>volutionary tradition, and possibly had personal
</p>
<p>acquaintance with survivors of the Babou\ists'
</p>
<p>movement. He was certainly well read in the
</p>
<p>old revolutionary literature. His influence on all
</p>
<p>the revolutionary movements of France during the
</p>
<p>nineteenth century was immense, and his following
</p>
<p>considerable among the student class, especially in
</p>
<p>Paris, during the early and mid-nineteenth century,
</p>
<p>as well as with the working classes of the large
</p>
<p>to^vns. Auguste Blanqui is a monumental instance
</p>
<p>of single-minded devotion to an ideal absolutely
</p>
<p>regardless of self, not in a time of crisis merely,
</p>
<p>but throughout a long life, for this noble old man
</p>
<p>closed his career of unflmching devotion, which
</p>
<p>included thirty-seven years of imprisonment, in
</p>
<p>1881, at the age of seventy-six. Two sayings of
</p>
<p>his may be quoted, as affording good instances of
</p>
<p>the influence of Babeuf and his doctrines on the
</p>
<p>nineteenth century revolutionary movements. In
</p>
<p>summing up his position on one occasion Blanqui
</p>
<p>wrote : " The social question cannot be earnestly
</p>
<p>and effectively discussed till after the next energetic
</p>
<p>and irrevocable solution of the political question."
</p>
<p>And again, in a programme dra\^Ti up by him in

<p>1869, we read: "The day after the Revolution,
</p>
<p>co:nclusion 261
</p>
<p>when the nation sees a new horizon before it, two
</p>
<p>parallel paths must be followed : the one leads to
</p>
<p>education, the other to the co-operation of the
</p>
<p>productive forces towards a common end." We
</p>
<p>see here plainly enough how the traditions of the
</p>
<p>movement of 1796 were carried do\Mi by a powerful
</p>
<p>personality far into the nineteenth century. And
</p>
<p>the influence of Blanqui still lives. Although the
</p>
<p>actual reconstructive proposals of Babeuf, and hence
</p>
<p>Babouvism as a Social doctrine, may be dead and
</p>
<p>superseded to-day, yet the Blanquists' notion, derived
</p>
<p>from the Babouvists, of the seizure of the political
</p>
<p>power by the revolutionary act of a minority, and
</p>
<p>the superintendence of the work of reconstruction
</p>
<p>by that minority, has still a following in the modern
